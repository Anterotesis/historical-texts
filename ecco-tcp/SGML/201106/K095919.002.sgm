<OPENER><DATELINE>GRANVILLE-PARK.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t met the mo&s;t vexatious di&s;appointment I ever experienced: it puts me out of all manner of patience. I am totally exhau&s;ted already, with di&s;&s;em|bling a chearfulne&s;s in which my heart can|not take the lea&s;t &s;hare, and concealing a me|lancholy that almo&s;t overwhelms me. I
<PB N="2" REF="4">had comforted my&s;elf with the hopes of a &s;peedy relea&s;e from this in&s;upportable re|&s;traint. Next week was fixt for our de|parture; but Mrs. Domville has taken it into her head to de&s;ire lady Lucy's attend|ance on an approaching occa&s;ion, &s;o that we &s;hall probably be detained above a month.</P>
<P>Sure, of all the <HI>longings</HI> peculiar to her &s;ituation, this is one of the mo&s;t unrea&s;on|able, and the mo&s;t provoking. How can lady Lucy, who has never been in a &s;imi|lar &s;ituation, be of any &s;ervice to her? But 'tis I that am unrea&s;onable; yes, and ill|natured too&mdash;What can be more &s;oothing than the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a friend, in the hours of &s;ickne&s;s and danger?</P>
<P>Lady Lucy, though de&s;irous of being with her &s;i&s;ter, would, on my account, have declined &s;taying; but I could not think of taking any advantage of her very obliging con&s;ideration for me. After the civilities I have received from every branch of the Domville family, I could not avoid paying them &s;o &s;light&mdash;or, to &s;peak more truly, what mu&s;t have appeared to them &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="5">&s;light&mdash;a compliment, without an unpar|donable degree of rudene&s;s and ingratitude. I was obliged to promi&s;e, not to let my. uncle come for me, or Mr. Domville would have in&s;i&s;ted on leaving me with you, and coming back again for lady Lucy:&mdash; di&s;tre&s;&s;ing kindne&s;s!</P>
<P>All the Linfield family leave this place to-morrow; lady Linfield, I believe, be|cau&s;e &s;he does not love the country, which, at this &s;ea&s;on, is a&s;toni&s;hing. Lady Lucy goes <HI>pour remplir les fonctions de &s;a charge aupres de madame</HI> Domville. The gentle|men mu&s;t attend their ladies.</P>
<P>The duke, and lady Cary&s;brook&mdash;who&s;e kindne&s;s frequently reminds me of another and dearer aunt&mdash;in&s;i&s;t upon my re&s;iding at Granville-park while I &s;tay in England; which I willingly con&s;ented to. Lord and lady Linfield profe&s;s&mdash;and, I have rea&s;on to think, with &s;incerity&mdash;that this is a point they would not have yielded to any body but my grandfather.</P>
<P>I like this arrangement much better than returning to London; for &s;everal rea&s;ons, which you will ea&s;ily gue&s;s:&mdash;one of them,
<PB N="4" REF="6">and not the weake&s;t, is, that I &s;hall be re|moved from lady Mary Web&s;ter; who was teazingly importunate with me, to tell her who Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's intended hu&s;band was. She &s;aid, it was but an act of ju&s;tice, of common humanity, to let him know her character. Neither ju&s;tice, nor humanity, dictated the re&s;olve;&mdash;'twas malice, and revenge, for imaginary wrongs. What! ruin a young lady's reputation and happi|ne&s;s, on &s;light, very &s;light, &s;u&s;picions! I would not be concerned in it, though ever &s;o indirectly, for millions! Let &s;ouls like lady Mary's &s;toop to &s;uch actions!</P>
<P>If I would barely let her know his name, &s;he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted mine &s;hould never be brought into que&s;tion. She would keep her word, I doubt not; &s;he could have no temptation to break it: but I have been taught to adhere to what I think right, from much higher motives than the fear of cen|&s;ure, or even than the hope of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I believe I have acted properly; yet, I own to you, madam, I am far from being ea&s;y. I am tortured with &s;olicitude for Sir Edward's happine&s;s. I cannot &s;uppre&s;s my
<PB N="5" REF="7">fears, although I know they &s;pring only from too creative an imagination, and, alas! too tender a heart: I &s;hould hate my&s;elf, if a want of candour to Mi&s;s Orm&s;|by had any &s;hare in forming them. But this cruel &s;ubject!&mdash;how came I to touch on it? Begin with what I will, I in&s;en&s;ibly fall into it. This is greatly tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on your indulgence, my generous friend.</P>
<P>Let us talk of &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t, I attempted a de&s;cription of this fine place. I deferred giving you any account of its inhabitants, till I &s;hould be able to judge of them with more accuracy and certainty than I could pretend to do from fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; for to penetrate im|mediately into people's characters, belongs only to tho&s;e who are ble&s;&s;ed with a great deal of natural &s;agacity, joined to a tho|rough knowledge of the world.</P>
<P>I have formed an opinion of the Sedley family on a &s;hort acquaintance, which I fancy a long one would not induce me to change. I have &s;tudied them&mdash;both my uncle and you compliment me with pene|tration&mdash;<HI>commen&ccedil;ons.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
The duke of Granville is far from being unamiable in his private character. He is an affectionate, careful, and indulgent pa|rent; readily forgiving &s;light faults, though&mdash;as my poor mother had too good rea&s;on to know&mdash;ab&s;olutely inexorable with regard to great ones. He is a warm friend, a kind ma&s;ter, a generous landlord, and a liberal benefactor to the poor. His exce&s;|&s;ive pride does not appear in his deport|ment to people that are extremely his infe|riors; to them he is generally mild, and &s;ometimes even conde&s;cending: to his equals&mdash;by equals, you may &s;uppo&s;e I cannot exactly mean &s;uch only as boa&s;t a title, birth, and fortune, great as his own; I u&s;e that term with re&s;pect to him, to &s;ig|nify all tho&s;e who have a decided right to keep the fir&s;t company; to &s;uch&mdash;he is very polite and ea&s;y; but he is mo&s;t forbiddingly haughty to per&s;ons in genteel middling life; which&mdash;<HI>par parenthe&s;e,</HI> and by your leave, ambition&mdash;I take to be the happie&s;t &s;tate in the world. Inferiors of this cla&s;s, his grace cannot &s;uffer for a moment to forget their di&s;tance. At his own table only&mdash;and
<PB N="7" REF="9">there they are &s;eldom invited&mdash;he relaxes a little, and treats them with a moderate de|gree of complai&s;ance. In mixed company, he pre&s;erves an air of re&s;erved &s;tateline&s;s, &s;oftened, however, by good-breeding, of which he has a large &s;hare. He is certain|ly vindictive; but not often &s;o to tho&s;e whom he has not once loved. His public character is not only good, but great: un&s;u&s;|pectedly di&s;intere&s;ted; unque&s;tionably im|partial; a firm &s;upporter of the ju&s;t prero|gatives of the crown; and a zealous a&s;&s;erter of the liberties of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Lady Cary&s;brook is a &s;weet, worthy woman; amiable in every relation of life; adored in her own family, and re&s;pected and beloved by every body that has the happine&s;s to know her. In a word, did I &s;peak of her to any other per&s;on, I &s;hould &s;ay&mdash;&s;he is like my aunt Chetwynd.</P>
<P>During the nine years &s;he has been a widow, &s;he has re&s;ided entirely with the duke.</P>
<P>Her elde&s;t child, lord Cary&s;brook, is now on his travels; &s;o I can &s;ay nothing more of him, than, that if he merits the fine
<PB N="8" REF="10">thing his &s;i&s;ters &s;ay of him, he is worthy of &s;uch a mother.</P>
<P>Lady Alicia Sedley is turned of eighteen; middle-&s;ized, has a very good per&s;on, and an exceedingly graceful air. Her face is not beautiful, yet wonderfully plea&s;ing:
<Q>"The body charms, becau&s;e the &s;oul is &s;een."</Q></P>
<P>That &s;oul is fraught with every gentle, endearing virtue, that can adorn her &s;ex.&mdash; She has all that touching &s;oftne&s;s, that dear complacency, that I love in Mrs. Went|worth.</P>
<P>Lady Fanny is two years younger: the prettie&s;t little creature imaginable;&mdash;ex|tremely lively, indeed even to giddine&s;s, though &s;he is by no means deficient in good &s;en&s;e. Her vivacity makes her much more &s;hewy and entertaining in a large company, than her &s;i&s;ter's diffidence will allow her to be; but in a family circle, or a <HI>tete-&agrave;-tete,</HI> lady Alicia &s;hines mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Robert Sedley is about thirteen, and re|markable tall and manly for that age. He is, in all re&s;pects, the fine&s;t boy I ever &s;aw.
<PB N="9" REF="11">I hope you will not think me partial in this deci&s;ion, when I tell you he is my lover.&mdash; He pays me compliments, with an elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, that is really &s;urprizing in &s;uch a child. If I &s;tand, he flies to reach me a chair: at the tea-table, he will attend me him&s;elf, if there were ever &s;o many &s;er|vants in the room: when we walk, he ga|thers flowers, makes them in a <HI>bouquet,</HI> puts them to his lips or brea&s;t, and pre&s;ents them to me with an air&mdash;<HI>quand on parle du loup, on en voit la queue:</HI>&mdash;Robert is at my elbow. I <Q>mu&s;t walk&mdash;&s;o fine a day &mdash;every body in the garden&mdash;.</Q> I bid you a ha&s;ty farewell, my dear aunt; for, though I have made the be&s;t bargain I could, I a&s;&s;ure you, I am obliged to give the monkey two ki&s;&s;es, to purcha&s;e time enough to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<P>O, I AM dying, Loui&s;a!&mdash;my brother is in a fever. For the love of Heaven, come to me.&mdash;Hold&mdash;I forgot your &s;ituation;&mdash;do not, by any means, think of coming: but tell Lord Methuen, his friend is ill&mdash;dangerou&s;ly ill.</P>
<P>I thank you for your information and coun&s;el; but I am not able to take the lea&s;t &s;tep in the affair at pre&s;ent, terrified and di&s;tracted as I am with apprehen&s;ions for a life, of ten thou&s;and times greater moment to me than my own:&mdash;my own! frivolous compari&s;on!&mdash;life has long &s;ince lo&s;t its va|lue to me: I regard it not as a ble&s;&s;ing, for which I ought to be thankful&mdash;and, O, for|give me, Heaven, if this be ingratitude&mdash; but rather as a misfortune, which it is my duty to bear with re&s;ignation.</P>

<P>My friend, my much e&s;teemed friend, pardon the&s;e fruitle&s;s and involuntary la|mentations: 'tis peculiarly ungenerous to trouble you with them.</P>

<P>I AM inexpre&s;&s;ibly alarmed:&mdash;Sir Ed|ward's fever is increa&s;ed. I cannot help thinking he is in great danger; though doctor Howard &s;ays he will do well. I have a high opinion of this gentleman's &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion; but, alas! he knows not Sir Edward's ca&s;e: his mind is &s;till more feveri&s;h than his body.</P>
<P>The unfavourable &s;ymptoms that have appeared this morning, I, with &s;evere com|punction, impute to my own imprudence la&s;t night. Having, with extreme difficul|ty, prevailed on Mrs. Wentworth&mdash;who&s;e delicate con&s;titution unfits her for the office of a nur&s;e&mdash;to retire to re&s;t, I took my place by my dear friend's bed. He lay very quiet: I endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s a cough for fear of di&s;turbing him; he per|ceived it, and &s;poke to me. <Q>I thought you had been a&s;leep,</Q> &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
"A&s;leep! my dear Methuen," &s;aid he, calmly; <Q>I expect my next &s;leep to be my la&s;t. Make every per&s;on leave the room; I wi&s;h to &s;peak with you.</Q></P>
<P>I ordered away his valet de chambre and nur&s;e-tender; and begging him not to exert his voice, or talk on any &s;ubject that might di&s;compo&s;e him, de&s;ired to know what he would &s;ay to me.</P>
<P><Q>Why &s;hould you give me this caution? &mdash;Of what con&s;equence would it be, were I to &s;horten my life by a few worth|le&s;s hours?</Q></P>
<P><Q>For God's &s;ake, my dear Edward, do not give way to this de&s;pondency: your life is not in any danger.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;orry," an&s;wered he, <Q>you &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to talk to me in this manner. I do not fear death: it is an object of terror only to the vicious, or the weak; or, at lea&s;t, to the happy. I tru&s;t you will not cla&s;s me with either of the two fir&s;t mentioned; and you can|not a&s;&s;ign me a place among&s;t the la&s;t.&mdash; Death is plea&s;ing to me, when I con&s;ider it as the only means by which I can avoid
<PB N="17" REF="19">fulfilling my fatal engagement. Do not think me ungenerous in allowing my&s;elf to talk thus. Mi&s;s Orm&s;by de&s;erves a better hu&s;band;&mdash;but, ah! I have no heart to give her. The too lovely Va|leria! &mdash;for her only would I live; and 'tis for her I die. Yes, Methuen, I am per&s;uaded I am on my death-bed; and while I have &s;trength and rea&s;on &s;uffi|cient, I would wi&s;h to &s;ettle my affairs.</Q></P>
<P>His words, his manner, pierced my in|mo&s;t &s;oul. I threw my&s;elf on my knees; I would have &s;poken, but could not com|mand utterance. He pre&s;&s;ed one of my hands in his&mdash;<Q>My dear Augu&s;tus! my tender, faithful friend! I did not expect le&s;s affection from you; but I looked for more firmne&s;s. I &s;ee I afflict you:&mdash; two or three words more, and I have done. I want to have my will drawn, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible. Mrs. Wentworth is richer than &s;he wi&s;hes to be; Mon&s;ieur de Villemar will make ample provi&s;ion for Mi&s;s Marchmont:&mdash;I therefore think my&s;elf at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of my fortune; and am determined to give my&s;elf the
<PB N="18" REF="20">&s;atisfaction of leaving the Marchmont e&s;tate to Mi&s;s O'Bryen. I have con&s;i|dered the matter maturely, and do not think it can any way hurt her character to accept it. My other little e&s;tate, and my hou&s;e in London, I mu&s;t pre&s;ent to your Arthur. Hold, Methuen,</Q> &s;eeing my lips move, <Q>this is a very trifling te&s;ti|mony of my friend&s;hip; and I am going to exact an important one of your's, and your lady's&mdash;Take care of my poor &s;i&s;ter. I leave her under your protec|tion. Con&s;ole her: let her not feel that &s;he has lo&s;t a brother.&mdash;I dare not think on what &s;he will &s;uffer. Dear, unfortu|nate Harriet!</Q>&mdash;His eyes filled with tears; he rai&s;ed them to Heaven:&mdash;<Q>Mer|ciful God! &s;upport and comfort her!</Q></P>
<P>We were &s;ea&s;onably interrupted by doc|tor Howard. He felt his patient's pul&s;e, and reprimanded me, in a whi&s;per, for my indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>I retired to a corner of the room, and gave vent to my <HI>in&s;uppre&s;&s;ible</HI> &s;orrow. Sir Edward's valet came over to me:&mdash; "M-m-my lord," &s;aid he, &s;tammering,
<PB N="19" REF="21">"is my dear ma&s;ter&mdash;". He was not able to fini&s;h his que&s;tion. I &s;queezed the hone&s;t fellow's hand, and &s;hook my head. He bur&s;t into tears, and turned away from me. If &s;uch is the grief of his &s;ervant, what can, what ought I to feel? His &s;i&s;ter too&mdash;I am convinced &s;he could not &s;urvive him a week.</P>
<P>But a ray of hope, my Loui&s;a, breaks through the thick gloom that &s;urrounds me. &mdash;If Mi&s;s Orm&s;by is not the meane&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t of her &s;ex, my vi&s;it to her mu&s;t have the de&s;ired effect. I have ju&s;t ordered my chai&s;e; and will &s;tep in and &s;ee my friend once more before I go.</P>

<P>O, LOUISA, this man is bent on his own de&s;truction&mdash;&s;olicitous for ruin!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had &s;ent off my me&s;&s;enger to you, I went to his chamber; and having &s;taid there for &s;ome time, wi&s;hed the doc|tor good morning as I was going out. Edward unfortunately over-heard me, and almo&s;t throwing him&s;elf out of bed, eagerly cried, "Where are you going, my lord?" Unprepared to an&s;wer this &s;udden que&s;tion, I only replied, that I &s;hould be back in a few hours. He made a motion with his hand to me to draw nearer to him. I obeyed. "Dear Methuen," &s;aid he, gra&s;p|ing my hand, and &s;peaking in a low voice, <Q>I know that nothing could tempt you to leave me in this extremity, but the hope of being of &s;ervice to me. Tell me, were you not this moment going to &s;ome of the Orm&s;by family, or to Mi&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="23">O'Bryen?&mdash;Your &s;ilence convinces me you were. But I intreat you&mdash;pardon me if I &s;ay, I command you&mdash;to do no &s;uch thing. Do you imagine I could meanly barter my honour for my life?&mdash; You ought to have known me better. You &s;hall not &s;tir from this &s;pot, till you have &s;worn to me to relinqui&s;h a project, which nothing but the exce&s;s of your friend&s;hip to me could excu&s;e your form|ing.</Q>&mdash;'Twas in vain for me to contend.</P>
<P>And now, dear Loui&s;a, how &s;hall I &s;up|port my&s;elf? Unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t my friend&mdash; almo&s;t hopele&s;s of his recovery&mdash;and &s;hould he recover, it will be only to be mi&s;erable for the re&s;t of his days. This is too heavy a tax upon my happine&s;s;&mdash;great as it is, it will not bear it.</P>
<P>He has mentioned his will to me this morning again. I have &s;ent for the lawyer. Heaven knows I am very ill able to give the nece&s;&s;ary directions.</P>
<P>I am mi&s;taken in my opinion of Mi&s;s O'Bryen, if this rich legacy will afford her any &s;atisfaction. And, I am &s;ure, I would much rather my &s;on &s;hould never have an
<PB N="22" REF="24">e&s;tate, than obtain one in this manner. I expre&s;s my&s;elf imperfectly: I would give&mdash; pardon me if I hurt your maternal tender|ne&s;s&mdash;but, by the powers that made me! I would give the &s;weet boy's life it&s;elf, to &s;ave my friend!</P>
<P>Philip's name need not be mentioned in the will, as he has lived but a &s;hort time with Sir Edward; but I &s;wear, by the faithful tears I &s;aw him &s;hed, he &s;hall never be obliged to &s;erve another ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>

<P>Although I am a total &s;tranger to you, &s;ir, I feel my&s;elf intere&s;ted in your wel|fare, by a kind of fellow&s;hip in di&s;tre&s;s; and am glad it is in my power to &s;ave you from a connection, which could yield you nothing but infamy and woe. &mdash;Mi&s;s Orm&s;by is a mean, artful, and wicked woman, who ba&s;ely betrays your confidence and love, and meditates the deepe&s;t wound upon your honour. But her own letter will characterize her bet|ter than I can do. Should a blind pa&s;|&s;ion induce you to que&s;tion its authenti|city, I am ready to inform you by what means it came into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

In this letter was inclo&s;ed one from Mi&s;s Orm&s;by to lady Conway, of which I &s;end you a tran&s;cript.</P>
<P>What a &s;pecious jilt is that vile Orm&s;by! &mdash;what a fini&s;hed hypocrite! She has tho|roughly attained what is the very ma&s;ter|piece of cunning&mdash;the art of hiding it&s;elf. My &s;urprize at her di&s;covered ba&s;ene&s;s, can only be equalled by my indignation. To what a creature was Marchmont about to unite him&s;elf! And was it to gratify a low-minded ambition, and to be a conve|nient cloak to a mo&s;t infamou&s;ly crimi|nal amour, that my invaluable friend would have &s;acrificed a tender and violent pa&s;&s;ion, for as de&s;erving and lovely a woman as lives? I cannot think of it with patience. I reflect on his danger and deliverance, with the &s;ame mixed &s;en&s;ation of unea&s;y joy and half-ex|tingui&s;hed fear, with which a man looks back on a precipice, from the brink of which he has ju&s;t e&s;caped.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e letters &s;hould be in&s;tantly &mdash;though very cautiou&s;ly&mdash;communicated to Sir Edward, I fear the emotions they may excite may hurt him. I will con&s;ult
<PB N="25" REF="27">with doctor Howard; I will tell him every thing: no regard is due to the character of that creature. How I execrate her! Thank God! thank God! my friend has e&s;caped her. Honour now permits&mdash;com|mands him to break with her. Yet &s;hould this di&s;covery come too late!&mdash;My joy would be extravagant, did not this dreadful apprehen&s;ion temper it. But I tru&s;t, that Supreme Ju&s;tice will not &s;uffer him to die a martyr to the noblene&s;s of his own &s;entiments. Loui&s;a, he will live!&mdash;he will be happy!&mdash;my heart is filled with trem|bling gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>With what contemptuous pity do I read the latter part of Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's letter! It is very expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ecret tortures that mu&s;t ever wait on the mo&s;t pro&s;perous wickedne&s;s. What de&s;picable lines are the&s;e!&mdash;<Q>Heigh-ho!&mdash;how melancholy the &s;tillne&s;s of the night makes one! The family are all a&s;leep. I hate &s;ilence. I wi&s;h I &s;lept in one of the &s;treet rooms.</Q> &mdash;Poor wretch! Loui&s;a, my &s;en&s;ible, my cha&s;te, my all-adorable Loui&s;a! could <HI>you</HI> have had a notion of clamorous voices
<PB N="26" REF="28">and rattling carriage wheels, being prefer|red to &s;ilence and contemplation?</P>
<P>How effectually do people de&s;troy their own peace of mind, when, by a vicious conduct, they &s;ubject them&s;elves to the low nece&s;&s;ity of deceiving others! thereby do|ing much more harm to them&s;elves, than ever the deceit can do to any body el&s;e. Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, though &s;he thinks her crimes beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;covery, and her &s;chemes beyond the reach of di&s;appoint|ment, dreads&mdash;&s;he knows not what; &s;tarts at her own &s;hadow, and finds namele&s;s ter|rors in the gloom and &s;ilence of the night. Had Sir Edward become the dupe of her artifices, and di&s;covered too late that he had lo&s;t both happine&s;s and honour, though to pre&s;erve the latter he nobly re&s;igned the former; yet, con&s;cious integrity would &s;till have &s;upported his hone&s;t &s;oul! and a thou|&s;and bright reflections would have broken the impending cloud of woe.</P>
<P>If all be not right within, how vainly do we endeavour to enjoy what we call plea|&s;ure!&mdash;how poorly do we &s;hrink from the lighte&s;t touch of mental pain!</P>
<Q><PB N="27" REF="29">
<L>"Almighty <HI>Virtue! 'tis</HI> to thee we owe</L>
<L>"Our ze&s;t for plea&s;ure, and our balm for woe."</L></Q>
<P>Our felicity depends almo&s;t entirely on the rectitude of our own hearts. Then, while we are daily complaining of the mi|&s;eries of life, what do we, but tacitly re|proach our&s;elves? The &s;ting of misfor|tune, indeed, is &s;harp; but if it be not poi&s;oned by the hand of vice, the wound it gives may ea&s;ily be healed. Let a man put on the "armour of righteou&s;ne&s;s," and the arrows of misfortune will drop at his feet: but if he will go forth to battle, naked and defencele&s;s, he mu&s;t bear the puni&s;h|ment ju&s;tly due to his ra&s;hne&s;s and ob&s;ti|nacy.</P>
<P>My beloved, you will excu&s;e me, if my reflections have wandered from my &s;ubject: for their &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, I do not apologize; I know you would not think your&s;elf obliged to me if I did.</P>
<P>My courier is ready; and I ha&s;ten to conclude, that I may not with-hold this in|tere&s;ting

<P>DOCTOR Howard and I held a con|&s;ultation ye&s;terday evening;&mdash;(perhaps, my dear, you did not before know that I was one of the faculty)&mdash;he thought it expedi|ent that my medicine &s;hould be admini&s;ter|ed immediately. Wanting, however, the con&s;ummate &s;kill of the phy&s;ician, and the happy &s;elf-confidence of the empiric, I de|liberated in anxious fearfulne&s;s. Often did I hold out to my patient the cup of joy; and as often drew back my hand, and with|held the hazardous recipe. I watched by him for &s;everal hours, in the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;tate of mind po&s;&s;ible to be imagined. About twelve o'clock he awoke, a good deal refre&s;hed, from a &s;leep of near three hours; the fir&s;t he has had &s;ince his illne&s;s. He pulled back the curtain&mdash;<Q>My dear Augu&s;tus, why will you &s;acrifice your health to me in this manner?</Q> For God's
<PB N="30" REF="32">&s;ake, go to bed. Where is my &s;i&s;ter?&mdash; Sure &s;he is not up too?"</P>
<P>I an&s;wered "No"; which, by the by, was fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The doctor looked at me with meaning, and took Philip out of the room.</P>
<P>I drew my chair clo&s;e to the bed; and feeling his pul&s;e&mdash;"You are better, my dear Marchmont."</P>
<P>"Are you turned phy&s;ician?" &s;aid he, with a faint &s;mile.</P>
<P><Q>Yes; and, with God's help, will do more for you than doctor Howard has been able to do.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I ob&s;erve you u&s;e the quack's prudent provi&s;o&mdash;<HI>with God's help.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"Don't put the quack upon me, &s;ir;" &mdash;rearing up my head as proudly as if it had been adorned by the huge faculty wig; &mdash;<Q>I'd have you to know, I pretend to be a phy&s;ician of more eminence than Howard him&s;elf: he applies his remedies only to the <HI>body,</HI>&mdash;I heal the <HI>mind.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He looked at me wi&s;tfully: <Q>Sure, my lord, you have not&mdash;But 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble,
<PB N="31" REF="33">after the &s;olemn promi&s;e you made me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will not clear my&s;elf from this half accu&s;ation, as I think you mu&s;t have too favourable an opinion of me, to &s;uppo&s;e me capable of breaking my word. But could no hand except mine, think you, loo&s;e your heavy chains?</Q></P>
<P>He replied, with a look of calm de&s;pair, <Q>Yes; the hand of death:&mdash;and that, I hope&mdash;</Q>.</P>
<P><Q>Hu&s;h! for mercy's &s;ake! As I hope to be merry for the re&s;t of my days, you have almo&s;t broken my heart already.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How &s;trangely you talk! Where is the &s;en&s;ibility, the tenderne&s;s, that di&s;|tingui&s;hes my friend?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Totally exhau&s;ted: and now I'm re|&s;olved to be gay, and you &s;hall be &s;o too. Why, man, I've news for you will &s;et you on your legs in three days time.</Q></P>
<P>"I cannot conceive," &s;aid he, &s;ighing, <Q>that you &s;hould have any thing to tell me, capable of reconciling me to life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Would not happine&s;s reconcile you to it?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">
<Q>Happine&s;s! Alas! 'tis flown for ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are mi&s;taken; it flew away, in|deed, but you have overtaken it; and, I doubt not, will &s;hortly be able to clip its wings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If you have really any agreeable intel|ligence for me, I intreat you tell it, with|out all this gaiety; which, excu&s;e me if I &s;ay, is a little ill-timed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By no means &s;o. Ought the me&s;&s;en|ger of joy to wear the livery of &s;orrow? I have two letters here</Q>;&mdash;taking them from my pocket&mdash;<Q>I wi&s;h I dare read them to you:&mdash;but you will be all emo|tion; rai&s;e your fever; and Howard will come in ju&s;t now, and &s;hake his big wig at me.</Q></P>
<P>"What letters are they?"</P>
<P><Q>You &s;hall know pre&s;ently: but fir&s;t let me a&s;k you,&mdash;have you fortitude enough to bear the lo&s;s of your mi&s;|tre&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>"My Valeria?" cried he, with extreme eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">
<Q>Not your Valeria; but Mi&s;s Orm&s;by: you have lo&s;t her for ever.</Q></P>
<P>"Is the poor girl dead?" demanded he, much &s;urprized.</P>
<P>"No. She is dead to you, though."</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid he, ha&s;tily, <Q>I hope &s;omebody has run away with her.</Q></P>
<P>"Very lover-like, upon my word!" ob|&s;erved I, laughing.</P>
<P><Q>Dear Methuen, do not trifle with my impatience.</Q></P>
<P>I read the letters to him; fir&s;t telling him their contents, that I might not &s;ur|prize him. The genero&s;ity that peculiarly marks his character, appeared in its &s;ull lu&s;tre:&mdash;he called Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's letter to her &s;i&s;ter, a forgery; until he had compared it with her hand-writing, which put the matter out of doubt. He framed excu&s;es for her: &s;aid, that Web&s;ter was undoubted|ly &s;ome artful, low-minded fellow, who by the force of per&s;onal allurements, and per|haps by too frequent opportunities of con|ver&s;ing with her, might have &s;tolen into her heart when &s;he was young and inexpe|rienced; and whil&s;t immature rea&s;on yet
<PB N="34" REF="36">wanted &s;trength to hold the reins of pa&s;&s;ion, had taken a ba&s;e advantage of her weakne&s;s and love. He added, that large allowances were to be made for her renewing her con|nexions with her lover, though married:&mdash; her reputation being ab&s;olutely in his power, her love for him violent, and a &s;econd breach of cha&s;tity much more difficult to with&s;tand than the fir&s;t; the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of worth was extinct, and mode&s;ty and pride, the two great &s;afeguards of female ho|nour, weakened; with regard to him, per|haps wholly &s;ubdued. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e effu&s;ions of humanity, he was over|joyed, enraptured, at his unexpected deli|verance; though too &s;evere to him&s;elf, and too indulgent to others, he blamed him&s;elf for being &s;o. "What a wretch I am," cried he, <Q>to rejoice at an incident &s;o full of horror! I might &s;ay, with the devil in Milton&mdash;<HI>Evil, be thou my good.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I forbore to an&s;wer him, le&s;t the length of our conver&s;ation &s;hould fatigue him too much. He lay &s;ilent and quiet a good while; but the agitation of his mind was ea&s;ily di&s;cernible in his &s;peaking counte|nance:
<PB N="35" REF="37">at length, giving a &s;pring, as by the impul&s;e of &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, he to&s;&s;ed the bed cloaths off his &s;houlders, and catching fa&s;t hold of both my hands,&mdash;<Q>O Methuen, if my Valeria&mdash;.</Q> He wanted breath to proceed. I intreated him to be com|po&s;ed; and endeavoured to make him &s;en|&s;ible, that his recovery depended entirely on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Although I was obliged to leave his thoughts at full liberty on this &s;ubject, I was determined to fetter his tongue; and ringing the bell, &s;oon brought in the attentive Philip; and a little after him, the doctor.</P>
<P>Sir Edward peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted on my taking &s;ome re&s;t; giving, at the &s;ame time, a like command to his valet; but the af|fectionate creature prote&s;ting&mdash;I believe with much le&s;s truth than good nature&mdash; that he had been in bed great part of the day, he was permitted to &s;tay; and I re|luctantly withdrew: but I could not think of &s;leep till I had given you this recital.</P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
Heaven be prai&s;ed! he is &s;omewhat bet|ter this morning. The doctor &s;ays his di&s;|order has taken a favourable turn. It is ob&s;erved, that phy&s;icians generally make the wor&s;t of their patient's di&s;temper, in order to give the greater opinion of their &s;kill in curing it:&mdash;this good-natured &s;on of Galen, <HI>au contraire,</HI> has been all along endeavouring to per&s;uade us, that Sir Ed|ward was in a le&s;s dangerous way than he really was. I believe Mrs. Wentworth would have been, by this time, as ill as her brother, if Howard had not kept up her &s;pirits, by the mo&s;t confident a&s;&s;urances of his recovery. However, he now agrees with me, in thinking the mo&s;t unhappy con&s;equences might have en&s;ued from the vexation of his mind. <Q>My &s;anguine hopes of him,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>aro&s;e from my ignorance of the original cau&s;e of his ill|ne&s;s. I &s;hould have thought it &s;trange, if four and twenty, and a &s;ound con&s;ti|tution, could not have overcome &s;uch a fever: but as he has &s;o lively an imagi|nation, and was ab&s;olutely <HI>determined to die,</HI> there is no &s;aying what might have
<PB N="37" REF="39">happened, But now, my lord,</Q> added he, with a benevolent &s;mile, <Q>that I may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume I have his imagina|tion on my &s;ide, and that he is wi&s;e enough to be <HI>determined-to live,</HI> my life for his, he will be able to vi&s;it his mi&s;|tre&s;s before this day three weeks.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall always think my&s;elf obliged to this good man, for the con&s;tant attendance he has paid here: to which, I am convinced, he was prompted more by a &s;incere e&s;teem for his patient, than by any view to intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Marchmont wanted to con&s;ult with his &s;i&s;|ter and me, on the mo&s;t proper way of break|ing off the treaty with Mr. Orm&s;by, with|out injuring the young lady. We both ad|vi&s;ed him not to perplex him&s;elf with the affair at pre&s;ent: the family has already been informed of his &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition:&mdash; nothing more need be done till he is well.</P>
<P>He then begged Mrs. Wentworth, or me, to write a line of acknowledgment to lady Mary Web&s;ter; carefully avoiding therein to make unnece&s;&s;ary reflections on Mi&s;s Orm&s;by. I &s;aid, if he plea&s;ed, I would go to lady Mary; as I was very cu|rious
<PB N="38" REF="40">to know how &s;he got Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's letter. My propo&s;al was readily a&s;&s;ented to; accordingly I go to London this even|ing; &s;leep at my own hou&s;e there to-night; wait on her lady&s;hip in the morning; and return to Hermitage to dinner.</P>

<P>I HAVE di&s;charged my commi&s;&s;ion <HI>&agrave; merveilles! Ecoutez.</HI></P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the evening with my worthy friend, dean Domville. We were quite <HI>en famille;</HI> no company but lady Lucy Domville and my&s;elf. I enquired of her lady&s;hip for the Hibernian beauty. She &s;miled at the epithet. "I wi&s;h," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>lady Enmore heard you; it would delight her. When Mi&s;s O'Bryen went to France, they at fir&s;t called her, by way of di&s;tinction, <HI>La belle Angloi&s;e;</HI> but lady Enmore, with a kind of national pride, in&s;i&s;ted upon its being changed into&mdash; <HI>Irlandoi&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked what &s;tay Mi&s;s O'Bryen made in England.</P>
<P>"I really cannot exactly &s;ay, my lord," &s;he replied; <Q>&s;he and I go together: my &s;tay depends on my &s;i&s;ter,</Q> looking archly
<PB N="40" REF="42">at Mrs. Domville; <Q>and my fair friend has now gotten a nur&s;ery of her own.</Q></P>
<P>"I heard &s;he was at Granville-park," &s;aid I. <Q>I hope none of that family is indi&s;po&s;ed?</Q></P>
<P>"They are very well," &s;he an&s;wered; <Q>but her countrywoman and mine, lady Mary Web&s;ter, is extremely ill. She reque&s;ted I would write to Mi&s;s O'Bryen to come to her; which I did ye&s;terday evening. I had a note from her this morning. She tells me the duke of Granville will not &s;uffer her to leave him; but the whole family will come to town this evening, on purpo&s;e to give her an opportunity of attending lady Mary.</Q></P>
<P>I was agreeably &s;urprized to find lady Lucy knew this lady, and threw out &s;ome que&s;tions concerning her as indirectly as I could; though, I dare &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding my caution, &s;he thought me very imperti|nently curious. The information I drew from her, is, in &s;ub&s;tance, as follows:&mdash; Lady Mary Web&s;ter is daughter to the late earl Enmore, who&s;e title became extinct at his death. He left every thing to his wife,
<PB N="41" REF="43">except her own fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds, which was &s;ettled on lady Mary.&mdash; Lady Enmore took her daughter and Mi&s;s O'Bryen to France with her la&s;t &s;ummer. A little time after the latter came over here, lady Mary left France&mdash;entirely again&s;t her mother's approbation and con&s;ent&mdash;with Mr. Web&s;ter; a man de&s;titute of birth, fortune, or character: "who mu&s;t have married her" &s;aid lady Lucy, "only with intere&s;ted views; as her manners and conver&s;ation are not engaging, and her per&s;on ugly, even to deformity. Her mother has not yet received her in|to favour; and I &s;uppo&s;e never will. I fancy," added &s;he, "lady Enmore will make Mi&s;s O'Bryen her heir, for &s;he is exce&s;&s;ively fond of her. I wi&s;h heartily that &s;he may; though, I am &s;ure, Va|leria her&s;elf does not wi&s;h it."</P>
<P><Q>Lady Mary is much obliged to your lady&s;hip,</Q> &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"O, my lord," putting up her lip, <Q>if you knew what a di&s;agreeable creature it is!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44">
"And &s;o," &s;aid the dean, <Q>becau&s;e the one is hand&s;ome, and the other ugly&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>"It is not that, brother," interrupted &s;he; <Q>but if you were as well acquainted with the noblene&s;s of my friend's mind as I am, I am certain you would join with me in wi&s;hing her as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by fortune, as &s;he is by birth, under|&s;tanding, beauty, and accompli&s;hments.</Q></P>
<P>We all joined in her ju&s;t panegyric: the dean did &s;o in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>I e&s;teem Mi&s;s O'Bryen as much as I admire her; and yet, if I were a &s;ingle man, I &s;hould be very &s;orry to be her lover.</Q></P>
<P>"Why &s;o?" demanded Mrs. Domville. <Q>I don't think &s;he has any thing of the in|&s;olence of a beauty.</Q></P>
<P>"Still," he replied, <Q>I could not bear the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inferiority; the fear of being thought pre&s;umptuous; the de|&s;pair of gaining her; and the mortifica|tion of &s;eeing her &s;urrounded by more de|&s;erving lovers.</Q></P>
<P>"However," &s;aid lady Lucy, <Q>your anxieties would be of &s;hort duration:
<PB N="43" REF="45">Valeria is too generous to trifle in the&s;e ca&s;es. But you would have a bad chance of &s;ucceeding, I can tell you: to my know|ledge, &s;he has refu&s;ed great matches. Indeed, it cannot be expected that <HI>we</HI> beauties" &mdash; affecting to look grave &mdash; &s;hould be as ea&s;ily won as other women. The language of admiration when &s;eldom heard, and only from one or two parti|cular per&s;ons, affects the heart wonder|fully: but tho&s;e, to whom every mouth has addre&s;&s;ed it, from their very cradles, become at length totally in&s;en&s;ible to it.</Q></P>
<P>This conver&s;ation naturally threw me in|to reflections on my friend's affairs, and excited a fear that Mi&s;s O'Bryen might not countenance his addre&s;&s;es. This very di&s;|agreeable apprehen&s;ion threw a gloom over my mind, and probably over my behaviour, though my friends were too polite to let me &s;ee they took notice of it. When I left the dean's, and got into my own &s;olitary hou&s;e, and &s;till more &s;olitary bed, my thoughts reverted to this &s;ubject: after con&s;idering the matter a good while, I determined to call on the young beauty in the morning.
<PB N="44" REF="46">Be &s;he as obdurate as &s;he may, thought I, &s;urely &s;he will not be able to refu&s;e the fine&s;t fellow in England, who is actually and li|terally dying for her. The more I rumi|nated on my project, the more I approved it: I could &s;ay more in his favour, than he could well do him&s;elf. I could repre&s;ent his connection with the unworthy Orm&s;by, more to his advantage than he could allow him&s;elf to do:&mdash;<HI>au pis aller,</HI> my interpo&s;i|tion could do no hurt; if it did not forward his &s;uit, at lea&s;t it could not retard it, or be any way detrimental to him.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I went to the duke of Granville's this morning, and de&s;ired to know if I might have the honour to &s;ee Mi&s;s O'Bryen. I was &s;hewn into a par|lour, and &s;ent up my name, She came down immediately&mdash;out of breath&mdash;evident|ly trembling&mdash;quite di&s;compo&s;ed&mdash;<HI>Je n'en augur ai pas mal.</HI> I determined to conquer her heart&mdash;don't be alarmed, Loui&s;a; only to conquer it for Marchmont&mdash;<HI>par un coup de main.</HI> I approached her with a dejected air:&mdash;<Q>'Tis on a very melancholy occa|&s;ion, dear Mi&s;s O'Bryen, that I give you
<PB N="45" REF="47">this trouble.</Q> The blu&s;h that confu&s;ion had &s;pread over her face on her entrance, vani&s;hed; &s;he became quite pale. I led her to a &s;eat; and cruelly re&s;olved to pur|&s;ue my advantage. <Q>You will pardon me, madam, if I enter abruptly into the occa&s;ion of my vi&s;it?</Q> She bowed her head. "Sir Edward Marchmont," re|&s;umed I, <Q>loves you to di&s;traction: he did &s;o from the fir&s;t moment he beheld you. An engagement, into which he had been very artfully drawn, obliged him to conceal his pa&s;&s;ion; the re&s;traint has thrown him into a violent fever;&mdash;he is dying!</Q>&mdash;She fainted. I caught her in my arms, and pulled the bell with violence. A &s;ervant came in, and &s;eeing her condition, ran up &s;tairs, without waiting for any orders. In a moment the room was filled; the duke, lady Cary&s;brook, her two daugh|ters, and a number of &s;ervants of both &s;exes, flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I carried her to a window;&mdash;Granville &s;natched her from me, and &s;upported her him&s;elf. He gazed on her with tenderne&s;s and concern; and glancing on me a regard of mingled &s;corn,
<PB N="46" REF="48">anger, and curio&s;ity&mdash;<Q>Who the devil are you, &s;ir?&mdash;What is the matter with her?&mdash;What have you done to her?</Q> I made no an&s;wer to the&s;e uncivil and pe|remptory interrogatories; but employed my&s;elf in throwing up the &s;a&s;h, and inter|nally cur&s;ing my well-meant &s;tratagem.</P>
<P>Lady Cary&s;brook admini&s;tered drops, cold water, &amp;c. with a countenance full of anxiety.</P>
<P>Lady Alicia Sedley wept; and held one of her cou&s;in's &s;nowy hands pre&s;&s;ed in both her own, of &s;carce inferior whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>Lady Fanny &s;eemed frightened out of her wits; ran up and down the room; jo&s;|tled the &s;ervants; &s;pilt a ba&s;on of water, and broke a bottle of hart&s;horn.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the lovely cau&s;e of all this bu&s;tle, opened her fine eyes; fixed them langui&s;h|ingly on me, and held out her hand. I ki&s;&s;ed it with ardour; I loved her for her &s;en&s;ibility; I loved her &s;till more, becau&s;e my friend was the object of that &s;en&s;ibility. The duke looked at me again:&mdash;<Q>Ble&s;s me!</Q> exclaimed he, <Q>Pray, are you not lord Methuen?</Q> I bowed my an|&s;wer.
<PB N="47" REF="49">"I am afraid, my lord," &s;aid he, <Q>I have treated you with indignity: I be|&s;ech you to excu&s;e me: I really did not recollect your face; and my grand|daughter's fit, &s;urprized and frightened me &s;o much, I was not ma&s;ter of my temper.</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him there was no occa&s;ion for apologies; and begged, that when the young lady was &s;ufficiently recovered, I might be permitted to &s;peak a few words to her, on a &s;ubject that was not likely to di&s;compo&s;e her: if he plea&s;ed, it &s;hould be in pre&s;ence of one of the ladies.</P>
<P>He nodded a doubtful a&s;&s;ent; and or|dered the &s;ervants to retire.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t u&s;e &s;he made of her returning &s;en&s;es, was to thank his grace, with the ut|mo&s;t &s;weetne&s;s, for his attention to her. He ki&s;&s;ed her; placed her on a chair, and &s;at down by her, his arm inclo&s;ing her elegant wai&s;t. He whi&s;pered to her: I &s;uppo&s;e to a&s;k, if &s;he cho&s;e to conver&s;e with me; for I heard her an&s;wer, <Q>Yes, my lord, if it be agreeable to you.</Q> He then reque&s;t|ed I would be kind enough to &s;pend the
<PB N="48" REF="50">day with him: lady Cary&s;brook &s;econded the invitation. I thanked them, but &s;aid it was out of my power, as I was indi&s;pen|&s;ibly obliged to leave town immediately, to attend the &s;ick room of a dear friend.</P>
<P>After a few compliments on both &s;ides, he wi&s;hed me a good morning; and de|&s;iring the young ladies to take care of their cou&s;in, took lady Cary&s;brook out with him.</P>
<P>Lady Alicia took her grandfather's &s;eat; I placed my&s;elf on the other &s;ide of Mi&s;s O'Bryen; and was preparing to tell her Edward's true &s;ituation, when &s;he turned to me with a deep &s;igh, <Q>What can I do, my lord?&mdash;What would you have me do? Your friend is engaged. But tell him,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, laying her trembling hand on my arm, <Q>tell him, though I can|not be his, he &s;hall never have the mor|tification of &s;eeing me another's.</Q> Her vermillion lips grew pale, and quivered as &s;he &s;poke: a flood of tears prevented her fainting again: &s;he leaned on the gentle Alicia's bo&s;om.&mdash;Admire, Loui&s;a, her extraordinary, her delicate and di&s;intere&s;ted
<PB N="49" REF="51">offer!&mdash;Don't you love this girl?&mdash; "Charming woman!" cried I, with tran&s;|port. <Q>Ju&s;tly, mo&s;t ju&s;tly, does lady Lucy Domville call you generous and noble-minded. Permit me thus,</Q> and I put one knee to the ground, <Q>to expre&s;s Edward's obligations to you.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Fanny &s;tarted up, and caught hold of me,&mdash;<Q>Ri&s;e, for pity's &s;ake: I have a mortal aver&s;ion to all tragedy &s;cenes.</Q> I aro&s;e, &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;ing her levity; but the tears that &s;parkled in her pretty eyes, half recovered my good opinion. She drew a chair, and &s;itting down be&s;ide me, with a familiar and not unplea&s;ing air, &mdash;<Q>Now explain this matter to me, my lord. I under&s;tand no more of it than this:&mdash;a gentleman, you call Edward, loves Va|leria, and is engaged; &s;he promi&s;es, be|cau&s;e &s;he cannot marry him, not to mar|ry any body el&s;e. It is very unju&s;t, in my opinion, both of you and the gentle|man; and, excu&s;e me,</Q>&mdash;&s;haking the powder out of her hair&mdash; <Q>very like the dog in the manger, to exact &s;uch a &s;acri|fice from her; and very romantic in her
<PB N="50" REF="52">to make it. To live &s;ingle!</Q> &mdash;&s;haking her head again&mdash;"to die an old maid!&mdash;".</P>
<P>"Fie, Fanny!" &s;aid her &s;i&s;ter; <Q>is this a &s;ubject for raillery?</Q></P>
<P>With a view to &s;pare Mi&s;s O'Bryen, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to lady Fanny. <Q>It would make me &s;o unhappy, madam,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>that you &s;hould think my conduct cen|&s;urable, that I mu&s;t beg your attention while I fully explain the whole affair:&mdash; I pre&s;ume you have &s;een Sir Edward Marchmont?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yes, in public; but I am not ac|quainted with him. He is delightfully hand&s;ome; and I have heard him very advantageou&s;ly &s;poken of. One might have compa&s;&s;ion enough to marry him; but not to take a vow of celibacy for his &s;ake.</Q></P>
<P>"Nor would he," I an&s;wered, <Q>de&s;ire any woman to make him &s;uch a <HI>&s;acrifice,</HI> as you ju&s;t now properly called it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But proceed, my lord; you were go|ing to tell me &s;omething.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Before Mi&s;s O'Bryen came to Eng|land, Sir Edward Marchmont made pro|po&s;als
<PB N="51" REF="53">of marriage to a young lady of &s;eem|ing worth; &s;olely induced thereto by the be|lief that &s;he loved him. Though as well formed to feel, as to in&s;pire, the ten|dere&s;t of all pa&s;&s;ions, he had a &s;trange&mdash; and, as he has &s;ince found, ill-grounded opinion of the in&s;en&s;ibility of his heart:&mdash; mi&s;taken gratitude taught him to give a faint preference to the lady in que&s;tion, and that was all he thought him&s;elf ca|pable of doing. He &s;aw Mi&s;s O'Bryen! &mdash;the di&s;cernment that made him &s;o nice in his choice, and had hitherto &s;ecured him from the &s;ex, now only enabled him the better to di&s;cover her exqui&s;ite merit. A novice in love, he attributed his new' feelings to ju&s;t admiration, and de&s;erved friend&s;hip, till his affections were too far gone ever to be recalled.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Fanny repeated the following lines of a &s;ong:&mdash;
<Q><L>"Les coeurs &agrave; l'amour rebelles,</L>
<L>"Tot ou tard &s;entent &s;es feux."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">
<Q>I hope you will experience the truth of the ob&s;ervation,</Q> &s;aid lady Alicia, <Q>for your impertinent interruption. Pray go on, my lord.</Q></P>
<P>I continued&mdash;<Q>Honour, that refinement of aggregated virtues, which never held a more unlimited &s;way than in Sir Ed|ward's brea&s;t, directed him to chu&s;e a life of mi&s;ery, rather than take the &s;mal|le&s;t &s;tep to free him&s;elf from an engage|ment, which the lady gave him every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to her happine&s;s. At length the wedding-day was fixt, and the violence of conflicting pa&s;&s;ions increa&s;ed. The near and certain pro&s;pect of compleat wretchedne&s;s could not &s;hake his re&s;olution; but it brought on a fever. Actuated by de&s;pair, he &s;hunned not&mdash;he courted death; and the continued perturbation of his mind, ad|ded hourly &s;trength to his di&s;order; 'till Heaven it&s;elf&mdash;I will &s;ay &s;o&mdash;interpo&s;ed. The injured wife of a man, to whom my friend's intended bride had &s;hewn un|bounded favour, &s;ent him a letter written by her, and addre&s;&s;ed to her &s;i&s;ter:&mdash;
<PB N="53" REF="55">Mi&s;s O'Bryen will be plea&s;ed to read the&s;e letters, while I tell you their contents. You will excu&s;e my &s;uppre&s;&s;ing names, as Marchmont would not forgive my ex|po&s;ing the young lady.</Q></P>
<P><HI>La belle Irlandoi&s;e</HI> took the papers with an air of confu&s;ion and &s;urprize, and went over to a window. When I perceived &s;he had done reading them, I approached her. &mdash;"Amazing! ab&s;olutely amazing!" &s;aid &s;he, in a low voice, as &s;he gave me back the papers: <Q>but can your lord&s;hip be cer|tain that letter was really written by Mi&s;s Orm&s;by?</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured her there was not the lea&s;t room to doubt it. The &s;imilarity of her beha|viour to Edward's, on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, &s;truck me.</P>
<P>Lady Alicia joined us. <Q>You will ex|cu&s;e us,</Q> &s;aid &s;he to Mi&s;s O'Bryen, <Q>if we leave you; it is time to dre&s;s; you know we have &s;ome vi&s;its to make before dinner.</Q> Without waiting for an an|&s;wer from her, &s;he turned to me&mdash; <Q>Our acquaintance, my lord, has commenced rather whim&s;ically; yet I flatter my&s;elf it will be durable: and I &s;hall ever re|member
<PB N="54" REF="56">this day with particular com|placency. Be a&s;&s;ured, your company mu&s;t always give the highe&s;t plea&s;ure to every individual of this family; and your friends&mdash;you under&s;tand me&mdash;</Q> &s;miling, <Q>may be certain of the be&s;t wel|come in our power to give.</Q></P>
<P>I made a &s;uitable return to her con&s;ide|rate politene&s;s; and &s;he retired with her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I then begged Mi&s;s O'Bryen's forgive|ne&s;s for the alarm I had occa&s;ioned her; candidly telling her my motives for it.&mdash; "In &s;hort," &s;aid I, <Q>I feared, that ac|cu&s;tomed only to refu&s;e, a common plea would not &s;uffice to move you: yet I told you no more than would have been true two days ago. Now, thank God! he is recovering, and I tru&s;t will &s;oon be out of danger.</Q></P>
<P>She &s;ighed gently, as I concluded. <Q>My lord,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>you compliment me too highly on the &s;ide of beauty; but al|low me to &s;ay, you do me not ju&s;tice in other re&s;pects:&mdash;why &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e me hard-hearted? Never did I hear a
<PB N="55" REF="57">&s;igh, to which the &s;igh of &s;ympathy did not unbidden ri&s;e; nor &s;aw a tear, I an|&s;wered not with tears. Believe me, I am above coquetry; and would neither ba&s;ely excite a vain expectation, nor un|generou&s;ly delay a favour I meant to grant.</Q>&mdash;Here, Loui&s;a, here is the language of a noble heart! This girl is worthy of my friend.</P>
<P>I conver&s;ed with her above an hour, with all the ea&s;e of friend&s;hip. I &s;poke of Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, without &s;crupling to cen&s;ure her as &s;he de&s;erves. Her beautiful rival for|bore to pa&s;s any judgment on her; in which &s;he certainly was extremely right; as it did not belong to virtue to excu&s;e, nor to the delicacy of her own &s;ituation to condemn her.</P>
<P>She treated lady Mary's mi&s;conduct with much more tenderne&s;s than lady Lucy had done: &s;aid, though &s;he might be blamed for her imprudent marriage, &s;he was great|ly to be pitied in its event. It was hard, &s;he &s;hould not find a friend in him, to whom &s;he &s;acrificed all her friends.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">
I a&s;ked what was her lady&s;hip's di&s;order. &mdash;She could not tell; as lady Lucy had not particularly informed her, and &s;he had not yet &s;een her, it being very late when &s;he came to town the preceding evening; but &s;he believed her in the la&s;t &s;tage of a con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>I told her of my me&s;&s;age, which I re|que&s;ted her to deliver for me, as I &s;uppo&s;ed I could not be permitted to &s;ee lady Mary. She promi&s;ed to do &s;o; and likewi&s;e to in|dulge the curio&s;ity I expre&s;&s;ed with regard to Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's letter, if it &s;hould be in her power.</P>
<P>I took my leave with reluctance, though well &s;atisfied, you may believe, with my &s;ucce&s;s. How &s;hall I rejoice my friend's heart! How does my own already rejoice in the anticipation of his happine&s;s!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t conclude, for my dinner waits. It will be the mo&s;t uncomfortable meal I ever &s;at down to, for I am quite alone. I be|lieve I &s;hould go to my &s;ervants' table, if I did not think my pre&s;ence would be a di&s;a|greeable re&s;traint on them.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
In order to have time to write to you, I &s;ent to let Mrs. Wentworth know I could not be with her till evening.</P>
<P>I hope to return to you in a few days.

<P>I PAY &s;uch clo&s;e attendance to the un|happy lady Mary, that I have &s;carcely a moment to my&s;elf; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould be much to blame for being four days &s;ilent, as I think&mdash;I flatter my&s;elf&mdash;you mu&s;t be im|patient and unea&s;y to hear how Sir Edward does. Prai&s;ed be God, he is better!</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you letters I received from him, and my affectionate friend, Mrs. Went|worth, the day after I &s;aw lord Methuen. &mdash; No, excu&s;e me; I &s;end Mrs. Wentworth's letter, and a <HI>copy</HI> of her brother's.&mdash;Don't laugh at me, dear aunt.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure you will admire the delicacy of his &s;tile. How few men, &s;ituated as he is, &mdash;for, doubtle&s;s, lord Methuen told him every thing&mdash;would expre&s;s him&s;elf thus delicately!&mdash;with &s;uch timid re&s;pect!</P>
<P>I have written to him, and not without tenderne&s;s; &s;ince I reproved him for en|dangering his health by writing to me, and
<PB N="59" REF="61">forbad him the u&s;e of his pen till he is well enough to leave his bed.</P>
<P>I believe I need not vindicate my beha|haviour throughout this a&s;&s;air to you. I know you are no friend to coquetry. In|deed, wherefore &s;hould not I, certain that I po&s;&s;e&s;s his affections, and uncon&s;cious of offence, entirely con&s;ide in him, who con|ducted him&s;elf with &s;uch nice honour to|wards a woman he did not love; and &s;till wi&s;hes, and &s;tudies, to promote her happi|ne&s;s, after receiving the gro&s;&s;e&s;t injury and affront it was po&s;&s;ible for her to offer him?</P>
<P>I think, madam, I never was &s;o oddly encompa&s;&s;ed with plea&s;ures and &s;orrows as I am at pre&s;ent:&mdash;one copious &s;ource of plea&s;ure I need not point out. Another, which I derive from the extreme kindne&s;s of my grandfather (he will always have me call him &s;o), and his family, is likewi&s;e &s;ufficiently obvious. I am extremely hap|py too, that my wi&s;hes for Mi&s;s March|mont are an&s;wered: &s;he tells me, that the amiable marquis de St. Clair has declared him&s;elf her lover. She has impo&s;ed on him a probation of two months: in his particu|lar
<PB N="60" REF="62">circum&s;tances, it was both delicate and prudent to do &s;o. I que&s;tion not, how|ever, he will find means to per&s;uade her to &s;horten the time. She writes to me with that warm and cordial friend&s;hip, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us before our little rivalry; and which, I feared of late, was in a great mea&s;ure extingui&s;hed on her &s;ide. She was unju&s;t; but I blamed human nature&mdash;not Mi&s;s Marchmont; and with a &s;ecret &s;atis|faction repeated tho&s;e very fine lines,&mdash;
<Q><L>"Ne vous informez point de leur reconnoi&s;&s;ance;</L>
<L>"Il e&s;t grand, il e&s;t beau de faire des ingrats."</L></Q></P>
<P>In &s;eeking Leonora's advantage, I found my own: the path of rectitude, I have ever experienced, leads to felicity.&mdash;O may I al|ways tread it! <HI>I</HI> endeavoured to &s;ecure <HI>her</HI> happine&s;s, and <HI>Heaven</HI> took care of <HI>mine.</HI> So much for my plea&s;ures:&mdash;you may be &s;ure I mean my lately acquired ones, as I do not mention my dear uncle or you.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">
My &s;orrows are&mdash;fir&s;t, an anxious &s;olici|tude, a thou&s;and tender fears for Sir Ed|ward's health. Secondly, and la&s;tly&mdash;how few people could &s;o ea&s;ily reckon up their &s;orrows!&mdash;a &s;incere affliction on lady Mary's account. Her chief phy&s;ician took me a&s;ide ye&s;terday, and hone&s;tly told me his attendance was quite unnece&s;&s;ary; the lady was beyond the power of medicine; might linger out a few weeks, but never could recover. I begged of him to conti|nue his vi&s;its, notwith&s;tanding; and a&s;ked if he did not think it expedient &s;he &s;hould be informed of her danger. He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid &s;he was very de&s;pondent al|ready; but as there were ab&s;olutely no hopes, I might do as I plea&s;ed. I have a poor opinion of the efficacy of a repentance ex|torted only through the fear of death; and imagine, that a dying per&s;on is far from being capable of properly &s;ettling even worldly affairs; for as the &s;oul, in its em|bodied &s;tate, mu&s;t have the expre&s;&s;ion of its powers modified by the nature of the or|gans through which it acts, it is clear, that any di&s;order in the nice mechani&s;m of the body,
<PB N="62" REF="64">mu&s;t affect the action of the &s;oul. Yet, though every body confe&s;&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of preparing for an event which cannot be prevented,&mdash;unhappily, there are but too many who love to po&s;tpone all con&s;idera|tion of it: therefore, I think it extremely wrong in a by-&s;tander to conceal the cer|tain approach of death: it is cruelty, at lea&s;t it is very ill-judged compa&s;&s;ion. It is not probable that either &s;piritual or tempo|ral concerns will be advantageou&s;ly &s;ettled at this very awful period, when the vigour both of mind and body is broken: but if it be po&s;&s;ible they can be &s;ettled at all, people &s;hould have a chance given them for doing it. With the permi&s;&s;ion of lady Mary's phy&s;ician, I undertook the mo&s;t painful and melancholy office I ever executed. She &s;eemed greatly alarmed; though &s;he &s;aid &s;he expected it. On the whole, however, &s;he behaved with fortitude; called death a refuge from calamities wor&s;e than death; calamities which &s;he had brought on her|&s;elf. She mentioned her mother with ten|derne&s;s; lamented her alienation from her; and &s;everely lamented her own di&s;obedience,
<PB N="63" REF="65">which &s;he con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of her &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes, having thereby in|curred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Almighty.&mdash; She appeared, altogether, in a frame of mind very &s;uitable to her &s;tate.</P>
<P>I ventured to a&s;k, if &s;he cho&s;e to &s;ee Mr. Web&s;ter. Her placidity was no more; &mdash;&s;he bit her lips&mdash;called him a villain, who had ba&s;ely betrayed, and ungratefully &s;acrificed her: loaded Mi&s;s Orm&s;by with execrations&mdash;not to &s;ay cur&s;es. I &s;hudder|ed; but as I perceived her pa&s;&s;ions were ju&s;t then too &s;trong to combat, I did not attempt. However, I have &s;ince taken oc|ca&s;ion to drop a few gentle hints on the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of forgiving injuries.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e her unworthy hu&s;band, and his &mdash;I mu&s;t add unworthy&mdash;mi&s;tre&s;s, are &s;till at Jeph&s;on-lodge. Both of them, I be|lieve, are as yet ignorant of the di&s;covery that has been made. <HI>Apropos</HI>&mdash;You are de&s;irous, I pre&s;ume, to know how lady Mary came by the important letter, that has done &s;o much harm to her&s;elf, and &s;o much good to &s;ome others:&mdash;lady Con|way, who, it &s;eems, is extremely giddy and
<PB N="64" REF="66">carele&s;s, left her cabinet open: her maid &s;earched it out of curio&s;ity; found that let|ter among&s;t other papers; which having read, &s;he mi&s;chievou&s;ly brought to lady Mary, who, you may imagine, hand&s;omely rewarded this fatal &s;ervice.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady Lucy Domville has ju&s;t been with me. She hears from her mother, that lady Enmore is returned to Ireland. I re|que&s;t you will immediately inform her of her daughter's &s;ituation.

<P>To my great &s;atisfaction, he is already approved by the duke, who is well ac|quainted with his character.

<P>I HAVE told you a thou&s;and times that Web&s;ter would be your ruin:&mdash;but I for|get it is you that are to &s;cold me.&mdash;My vile carele&s;&s;ne&s;s! We mu&s;t fix on &s;ome plan:&mdash;to qualify you for it, I &s;hall give you a detail of very di&s;agreeable particu|lars. My father and Sir James went ye&s;|terday morning to &s;ee Sir Edward March|mont, which they would have done &s;ooner, had they been certain his fever was not epidemical. They were received with fro|zen civility by lord Methuen: Mrs. Went|worth did not appear. His lord&s;hip &s;aid, Sir Edward was better, but not well enough to &s;ee them; and coldly thanked them, in his name, for the honour of their vi&s;it. He had not the politene&s;s to a&s;k either for you or me; but &s;aid, &s;lightly, he hoped Mrs. Orm&s;by was well. My father profe&s;&s;ed much concern, that the honour which had been intended his family, had been &s;o di&s;|agreeably
<PB N="69" REF="71">deferred. The in&s;olent peer took no manner of notice of this; but, with a wonderful <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI> re&s;umed a po|litical &s;ubject he had before introduced. He made them take wine, and &s;ome re|fre&s;hments, but did not a&s;k them to &s;tay to dinner, though it was pretty late. My fa|ther is mon&s;trou&s;ly huffed; but Sir James &s;eems to think nothing about the matter:&mdash; he, you know, is one of tho&s;e dull, ea&s;y, mortals, whom it is difficult to vex, and impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I was to &s;pend the evening at Mrs. Hil|ton's rout; and took it into my head that &s;ome rings, I &s;eldom wear on account of their &s;lightne&s;s, would look well enough among&s;t my others,; but having &s;ought them in vain, I was obliged to go without them.</P>
<P>I di&s;engaged my&s;elf from the card-table after playing one pool of quadrille, in order to flirt with Frank Pre&s;ton. As we chatted together, an officer came up to him; per|haps to take a nearer view of me. <Q>Well, Bathur&s;t,</Q> &s;aid my beau, <Q>give an ac|count of your&s;elf. Where were you
<PB N="70" REF="72">rambling to-day? I called at your lodg|ings, and they told me you had gone out of town. The &s;mart widow, to be &s;ure&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, upon my honour: I did not &s;ee the lady you hinted at the&s;e three days. I confe&s;s, however, I was at the hou&s;e of a rich, hand&s;ome young widow; but I went there to &s;ee her brother, Sir Ed|ward Marchmont.</Q></P>
<P>I pricked up my ears.</P>
<P>"How is he?" a&s;ked Pre&s;ton: <Q>Is he able to &s;ee company?</Q></P>
<P>"He keeps his room &s;till," returned the other; <Q>and I &s;uppo&s;e admits only parti|cular friends.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Hannah, it is plain he &s;aw major Bathur&s;t, though he was denied to our gentlemen; and if there was not&mdash;to borrow my eloquent Sir James's phra&s;e&mdash;&s;omething extraordinary in the wind, it is to be ima|gined, he would have con&s;idered your fa|ther and brother-in-law as his <HI>particular friends.</HI> But you have not heard the wor&s;t yet, I can tell you. This morning&mdash;Lord knows how I came to be &s;o careful&mdash;I re|newed
<PB N="71" REF="73">my &s;earch for the rings, but without effect. The unea&s;ine&s;s my <HI>&s;uivante</HI> di&s;co|vered, while I ran&s;acked my drawers, &amp;c. for them, induced me to &s;u&s;pect &s;he had &s;tolen them. I called to mind having for|gotten my keys on my toilette, about ten days ago, when I dined at my father's; and being alarmed for the &s;afety of a little cabi|net, wherein I keep things of mo&s;t value&mdash; as jewels, money, papers&mdash;I ran to &s;ee if the enemy had carried their depredations &s;o far. I mi&s;&s;ed, be&s;ides the rings, ten or twelve guineas, &s;ome gold pocket-pieces, my grandfather's picture, and that of the reverend gentlewoman, his wife. As to the pictures, if the wench had been con|tentented with taking them, I &s;hould not have cared a farthing, though they were &s;et in gold, which, I pre&s;ume, was the rea&s;on of her &s;tealing them; it could not be for their extraordinary beauty, I am certain.&mdash; How proud my poor grandfather would have been, had &s;omebody, in the &s;pirit of pro|phecy, foretold what was to befal his pic|ture in the <HI>latter days!</HI> Little did he think that a fair oue would venture her neck to
<PB N="72" REF="74">po&s;&s;e&s;s her&s;elf of it. I'll an&s;wer for it, no woman went &s;uch lengths in his favour, during his life. The Lord &s;end Harris a hu&s;band as old and as ugly, to puni&s;h her for her di&s;hone&s;ty.&mdash;But I was going to &s;ay, that, though willing to indulge my maid with the pictures, I did not much re|li&s;h the lo&s;s of the re&s;t. I was frightened le&s;t the creature had had the curio&s;ity to look at my letters: there were &s;ome from &mdash;you may gue&s;s who;&mdash;no harm in a little flirtation, Hannah;&mdash;I found the&s;e in a place by them&s;elves, and they did not appear to have been touched. I pre&s;ently mi&s;&s;ed the letter you wrote to me the night before you went to Jeph&s;on-lodge. I don't exactly remember its contents, but I am &s;ure they were of a nature not to bear my lady Harris's in&s;pection. After tumbling up and down for it a great while, to no purpo&s;e, I called her up, and abruptly charged her with robbing me; threatening to &s;end her to jail. She denied the fact; and &s;aid, if I had lo&s;t any thing, there were other &s;er|vants in the hou&s;e as liable to be &s;u&s;pected for the theft as &s;he. Accordingly, I a&s;&s;em|bled
<PB N="75" REF="75">the female part of my family, and be|gan a general examination. They unani|mou&s;ly avowed their innocence: one of them offered to give her oath &s;he had not been in the room; which was echoed by all the re&s;t, except one of the chambermaids, who &s;aid &s;he had been in the room, but would &s;wear &s;he had &s;tolen nothing. Har|ris frowned at her. It in&s;tantly &s;truck me, this girl knew &s;omething of the affair; and thinking, as &s;he is a young, country &s;im|pleton, &s;he would be ea&s;ily wrought upon, I took her into another room, and there prote&s;ted I &s;hould &s;end her to jail that mo|ment, if &s;he did not tell me the whole truth. She fell upon her knees; cried bit|terly; made &s;trong prote&s;tation of hone&s;ty, and &s;o forth; and, begging me to have mercy on her, confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had gone into my chamber by accident that evening, and &s;aw Mrs. Harris reading a letter, &s;tand|ing at my cabinet, which was open: her laughing over it, it &s;eems, excited Debo|rah's curio&s;ity, which the other gratified, by reading it to her. I que&s;tioned her concerning it; and from the confu&s;ion of
<PB N="74" REF="76">her an&s;wers, had the &s;atisfaction to find &s;he did not rightly comprehend it. She af|firmed, &s;he did not know of my maid's taking any thing but that letter. I eagerly a&s;ked what had been done with it. She he|&s;itated: I placed the formidable jail before her eyes once more. She acknowledged, that Harris had told her in confidence, that &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of it to a lady, who had given her a great deal of money for it.&mdash; "What was the lady's name?" She did not remember it. <Q>Was it lady Mary Web&s;ter?</Q> "It was." I was be&s;ide my&s;elf with rage. Only think what a ma|licious action it was in the treacherous wretch! I forced her keys from her, and in a little box, in one of her drawers, found the pocket-pieces, rings, and pictures. I demanded my money. She &s;aid I owed her as much wages; which I believe was true: &s;o after venting my rage on her, as far as impotent words could do it, I turned her away: and very merciful I was, to let her come off &s;o ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>What is now to be done, Hannah? I am convinced lady Mary&mdash;&s;he is certainly
<PB N="75" REF="77">capable of it&mdash;has done you &s;ome ill office with Sir Edward: perhaps &s;ent him the very letter. You know lord Methuen and he are prodigiou&s;ly intimate: what was known to one, would not long be a &s;ecret to the other; and, without his lord&s;hip had &s;ome good rea&s;on for it, I cannot believe he would have treated my father and Sir James as he did; for he is confe&s;&s;edly exceedingly well-bred.</P>
<P>Can you think on any &s;cheme, whereby to extricate your&s;elf from this terrible di|lemma? You may depend on my bearing any part in it you plea&s;e to allot me.&mdash; Could we contrive to di&s;avow the letter, and make the whole appear the effect of lady Mary's malice, and groundle&s;s jea|lou&s;y? She will &s;oon be out of a condition to contradict us: &s;he is given over;&mdash;there's con&s;olation for you!</P>
<P>I don't know what part to recommend to you. I think it is well worth your while to go great lengths to &s;ecure a hu&s;|band of Marchmont's con&s;equence: but do not advance a &s;tep without being &s;ure of your ground: he is penetrating; and, take
<PB N="76" REF="78">my word for it, has not pa&s;&s;ion enough for you to blind him. His demure &s;i&s;ter, I &s;uppo&s;e, would be con&s;ulted; and women find out women's artifices much more ea&s;ily than men do. I dread, too, lord Me|thuen's cool judgment.</P>
<P>If you think he is irrecoverably lo&s;t&mdash;and, not to flatter you, I fear he is&mdash;all you can do, is to invent &s;ome plau&s;ible &s;tory to deceive my father, and throw your&s;elf on Sir Edward's genero&s;ity to countenance it; for if he di&s;covers your intrigue with Web|&s;ter, you are utterly undone: and I don't &s;ee how he can well avoid di&s;covering it, as he will be under the nece&s;&s;ity of making a &s;ufficient apology for breaking off a match, which was on the point of being concluded. O, that horrid fever! Nothing ever was &s;o <HI>mal a propos.</HI> Had it &s;eized him one week later, you would have been lady Marchmont. A &s;eparation would have been the wor&s;t that could have happened; and that is often a very de&s;irable thing.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e poor Mr. Web&s;ter is piteou&s;ly grieved for his lady's illne&s;s. I hope you are humane enough to endeavour to com|fort
<PB N="77" REF="79">him. 'Tis really melancholy, that &s;uch a <HI>beautiful</HI> woman &s;hould be cut off in the bloom of life.</P>
<P>Happen what may, it is my advice to you, never think of taking Web&s;ter <Q>for better for wor&s;e:</Q> ambition and prudence&mdash; though they &s;eldom give the &s;ame coun&s;el&mdash; equally oppo&s;e it. He is meanly born; and, <HI>entre nous,</HI> our blood wants a little refining; on one &s;ide at lea&s;t. His wife's fortune&mdash; you know he has nothing el&s;e&mdash;will not entitle him to your's: and, depend on it, he would &s;oon run through both. Be&s;ides, as you can never expect that my father will con&s;ent to your making &s;uch an alliance, you mu&s;t wait till his death, which is pro|bably a di&s;tant event. Add to all this, Web&s;ter will not have any re&s;pect for you, or confidence in you, after the experience he has had of your character:&mdash;excu&s;e this free remark. Be guided by me; &s;et your cap at &s;ome &s;ober, leaden-pated fellow, with a good e&s;tate, over whom your beauty will &s;ecure you an ea&s;y dominion. Retain Web&s;ter, &s;ince he is &s;o agreeable to you: and if you conduct your&s;elf with common
<PB N="78" REF="80">prudence, you have &s;uch a gentle, inno|cent, &s;anctified appearance, you will never be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P><HI>O ciel!</HI> what a letter is here! the longe&s;t I ever wrote. I expect you to thank me for it. It puts me in mind of my board|ing-&s;chool corre&s;pondence with Burton, when I</P>

<P>Soon will this in&s;olent and cruel wretch enjoy the fortune of her, whom he has murdered, without the heavy incumbrance of a hated wife. Perhaps I am too &s;evere, in &s;aying he has murdered her, as &s;he had &s;trong &s;ymptoms of a decay, long before they were married: that he has &s;hortened her life, however, by &s;ome months&mdash;or, it may be, years&mdash;is a circum&s;tance that will not admit of doubt. The poor creature, I fear, cannot hold out much longer: I ought not to have &s;aid, I fear; for, in her dread|ful &s;tate, it is rather the part of huma|nity
<PB N="85" REF="87">to wi&s;h to ha&s;ten, than retard her death.</P>

The &s;oothing gentlene&s;s of your manners, admirably fits you to perform the&s;e &s;orts of melancholy offices; and I know the goodne&s;s of your heart ever leads you to &s;eek them.</P>
<P>I thank you ten thou&s;and times, for the warmth of your congratulations on a cer|tain &s;ubject: they are ju&s;t &s;uch as I expected from the kinde&s;t friend, and be&s;t natured woman in the world.

<P><PB N="86" REF="88">
I am delighted with your account of Sir Francis O'Bryen: he is worthy of the no|ble name he bears. My uncle was quite right&mdash;as he always is&mdash;in declining his very generous offer with regard to me. As to the jewels, I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity for my ac|cepting any, and wi&s;h I might be excu&s;ed; but as he is &s;o earne&s;t, and you &s;eem to think there would be a di&s;obliging formality in my continuing to refu&s;e them, I &s;hall take a few rings, or pins, or &s;omething not exceeding the value of one hundred pounds.</P>
<P>I cannot an&s;wer your que&s;tion concerning the chevalier du Mornai: I never heard of him before the la&s;t letter I received from my uncle. If your mentioning Mrs. Wentworth's name in &s;o &s;light a manner, was really the cau&s;e of his di&s;order, there mu&s;t certainly be &s;omething extraordinary in the affair. I &s;uppo&s;e, by O'Bryen's im|mediately retiring with him, he is in his confi|dence. I agree with you in thinking he mu&s;t be a lover of Mrs. Wentworth's.&mdash; Po&s;&s;ibly he may have &s;een her at Paris, where &s;he has &s;pent &s;everal months. His attachment could hardly have commenced
<PB N="87" REF="89">&s;ince her widowhood; as, during that pe|riod, &s;he has lived in almo&s;t a mona&s;tic &s;e|clu&s;ion from the world.

<P>WILL you, madam, permit Alicia Sedley to addre&s;s a few lines to you, for your niece, who is at pre&s;ent engaged in the very difficult ta&s;k of informing lady En|more of her daughter's death? Valeria and I have &s;at together this hour, weeping over the remembrance of the &s;ad &s;cene we have been &s;o recently witne&s;&s;es of; and la|menting the hard fate of this mo&s;t unhappy woman.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s O'Bryen, my mother, and I, &s;pent &s;ome part of this morning with lady Mary, without perceiving any alteration in her. As we &s;at at dinner, a me&s;&s;age came from Mi&s;s O'Bryen's maid&mdash;who has attended her lady&s;hip &s;ince we came to town&mdash;in|forming us, that &s;he was much better with|in the la&s;t half hour; had &s;poken &s;everal times, and, for the mo&s;t part, very ra|tionally. Impatient to behold this happy
<PB N="90" REF="92">change, my cou&s;in and I drove to Dover|&s;treet, the moment we could di&s;engage our&s;elves from the table. On approaching the bed, our too &s;anguine hopes immedi|ately &s;ub&s;ided: the wildne&s;s of her eyes was the only vi&s;ible alteration in the death-like appearance our patient had &s;o long worn. She would have &s;tretched out her hand to Valeria, but could not, from extreme weakne&s;s. "It is as you told me," &s;aid &s;he; "I am ju&s;t going."</P>
<P>"What &s;hall we do, Valeria?" whi&s;|pered I, in great terror. <Q>Had we not better di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger to Mr. Bailly?</Q>&mdash;my grandfather's dome&s;tic chaplain, madam, who had before admi|ni&s;tered the &s;acrament, and frequently read prayers to her lady&s;hip. We in&s;tantly &s;ent to him, and to her two phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s O'Bryen then placed her&s;elf on a chair that &s;tood at the head of the bed, and drawing back the curtain a little, was going. to &s;peak; when lady Mary cried out&mdash;<Q>My mother too!&mdash;my own mother to refu&s;e ever to &s;ee me! And even&mdash;</Q>. The remainder of the &s;entence was &s;o inar|ticulately
<PB N="91" REF="93">pronounced, I could not under|&s;tand it.</P>
<P><Q>Your mother has entirely forgiven you. &mdash;She charged me to a&s;&s;ure&mdash;</Q>.</P>
<P>Lady Mary, without attending to her, exclaimed&mdash;<Q>Web&s;ter! you cruel, trea|cherous villain!&mdash;</Q>. And immediately afterwards&mdash;<Q>Hannah Orm&s;by! Hannah Orm&s;by! may everla&s;ting cur&s;es&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>Valeria, with her u&s;ual pre&s;ence of mind, prevented her fini&s;hing this horrid imprecation:&mdash;in&s;tantly ri&s;ing, and a&s;&s;um|ing a tone of authority, that was quite ne|ce&s;&s;ary to re&s;train her fury,&mdash;<Q>What are you doing?</Q> &s;aid &s;he: <Q>do you know that a few minutes hence you may be called to account for your &s;ins&mdash;and dare you add this black one to their cata|logue? Is this obeying his precepts, who taught us to love, and pray for our enemies? Pardon tho&s;e that have in|jured you, if you would be pardoned your&s;elf. Your earthly parent has for|given you;&mdash;in like manner may your heavenly father pardon all your tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions!</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he knelt, and with
<PB N="92" REF="94">that air of humility, which becomes the creature when addre&s;&s;ing the creator&mdash;joined to a dignity and &s;olemnity, that mu&s;t have commanded the reverence of any per&s;on who had the lea&s;t remains of rea&s;on,&mdash;&s;he prayed aloud. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly awed, and knelt likewi&s;e, as did the women that were in the room. A faint, but fearful, &s;hriek i&s;&s;ued from the bed: we all &s;tarted up, except Mi&s;s O'Bryen. I flew to her: &mdash;terrified, le&s;t the unfortunate lady, in her madne&s;s, &s;hould attempt to hurt her. In my fright I forgot her debility. The fir&s;t look I gave at her, almo&s;t petrified me with horror. Nothing can be conceived more frightful, than the quick and wild rol|lings of her &s;unk eyes, and the dreadful di&s;tortions of her gha&s;tly face. I am amaz|ed my lovely friend had the courage to re|main &s;o near her. She &s;hrunk not from the bed-&s;ide, but continued to kneel by her:&mdash; now gazing on her with fa&s;t-falling tears of compa&s;&s;ion; then rai&s;ing her eyes and cla&s;p|ed hands to Heaven, her lips moved trem|blingly, as in fervent prayer. Perceiving I could &s;carcely &s;tand, and that I &s;upported
<PB N="93" REF="95">my&s;elf by holding the curtain, &s;he aro&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted upon my allowing her Eleanor to attend me home. I refu&s;ed to leave her. During this friendly conte&s;t Mr. Bailly ar|rived; and one of the phy&s;icians, who de|clared his patient to be in the la&s;t agonies, and led us both into another room. In about an hour after they told us &s;he was dead. As &s;oon as we had a little recovered from this &s;hock, Mi&s;s O'Bryen, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lady Mary's maid, locked all the apartments, which it was not nece&s;&s;ary for the convenience of the &s;ervants &s;hould remain open; and leaving the keys in her lady&s;hip's dre&s;&s;ing-room, and locking the door, and &s;etting a &s;eal on it, &s;he inclo&s;ed the key in a letter &s;he made the waiting|woman write to Mr. Web&s;ter, and which &s;he &s;ent to him by one of our footmen, be|fore we quitted the melancholy hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s a &s;ubject, &s;o little calculated to plea&s;e either the imagination or the heart. If my being &s;o circum&s;tan|tial, has been tedious and di&s;agreeable, it is Valeria, by who&s;e de&s;ire I was &s;o, that mu&s;t be blamed for it.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">
I cannot conclude, without expre&s;&s;ing the earne&s;t de&s;ire I have to be ranked among&s;t the happy number you honour with your acquaintance. I would a&s;pire to more &mdash;to your friend&s;hip. Mi&s;s O'Bryen paints your character in colours &s;o engagingly ami|able, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to love you; and nothing, you know, is more natural than to &s;eek a return of affection, however de&s;|titute one may be of any ju&s;t claim to it.</P>
<P>I hope my grandfather's pre&s;ent fondne&s;s for Valeria&mdash;which from the &s;teadine&s;s of his temper, and her uncommon merit, I am per&s;uaded mu&s;t endure&mdash;will obliterate the remembrance of pa&s;t unkindne&s;&s;e&s;s, and extingui&s;h the animo&s;ity that has &s;o long &mdash;and, I may add, &s;o cau&s;ele&s;sly&mdash;&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the O'Bryen and Sedley families.</P>

<P>NO more of your &s;oft reproaches, my lovely Loui&s;a. I fly to you. I &s;hall be in my chai&s;e to-morrow, as &s;oon as Phoebus a&s;cends his chariot; and before he takes his night's draught of &s;ea-water&mdash;a potation I &s;hall not much envy him&mdash;I expect to drink a &s;ocial cup of tea with my angel: and when the god repo&s;es him&s;elf on The|tis's bo&s;om!&mdash;my charming Loui&s;a!&mdash; But I have done. Allow me &s;ome merit in thus breaking off my bold parallel.</P>
<P>As I would not have the &s;hadow of a frown remain on that dear brow when we meet, I mu&s;t repeat to you the cau&s;e of my &s;tay at Hermitage.&mdash;Edward, by means of his vigorous con&s;titution, and great flow of animal &s;pirits, has, I thank God! reco|vered as fa&s;t as it was rea&s;onable to expect he could, from &s;o violent a fit of illne&s;s;
<PB N="96" REF="98">but his bri&s;k and &s;anguine temper ill brook|ed &s;uch &s;low advances to health. Ever &s;ince my conference with Mi&s;s O'Bryen, he has imagined him&s;elf quite well; and would hardly &s;ubmit to be treated <HI>en malade.</HI> He wanted to go to London before we thought it &s;afe for him to leave his room. As &s;oon as he was permitted to take the air, he renewed his re&s;olution, and per&s;i&s;ted in it with a degree of ob&s;tinacy not natural to him. He attributed his &s;i&s;ter's oppo&s;ition to the timidity of her &s;ex, and the appre|hen&s;ivene&s;s of her temper, increa&s;ed by her exce&s;&s;ive affection for him. She ob&s;erved, that he paid more regard to my remon|&s;trances, and begged me not to leave him till he was perfectly recovered. Ill would it have &s;uited my friend&s;hip for them both, not to have complied with her de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I have told you all this before, my love; and yet you almo&s;t blame me for &s;taying from you. I thank you for this petulance: I would not have you unmoved by my ab|&s;ence, however nece&s;&s;ary. I am too fond to be always rea&s;onable my&s;elf; and I can|not &s;uffer you to be a bit wi&s;er, in this re|&s;pect,
<PB N="97" REF="99">than I am. Your general &s;uperiority, I behold not without jealou&s;y,&mdash;yet with pride, and with plea&s;ure. When I hear a man declare&mdash;and many &s;uch declarations have I heard&mdash;that he would not marry a lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, I regard him as a conceited blockhead: no matter whe|ther a learned, or an illiterate one. A man of under&s;tanding would, a&s;&s;uredly, prefer a &s;en&s;ible and agreeable companion, to a &s;illy, or an in&s;ipid one: he that would chu&s;e the rever&s;e, is a puppy; and never intends to treat his wife with that re&s;pect which her &s;tation, and even her &s;ex, entitles her to; and which he ought to pay for his own &s;ake, if incapable of being actuated by a more generous motive. Puffed up with the imagined &s;uperiority of his own &s;ex&mdash;and, at the &s;ame time, aukwardly con&s;cious that he does not him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;s it&mdash;he would fear to have a wife's under&s;tanding &s;et in contra&s;t to his own &s;hallowne&s;s. Blinded, or mi&s;led by vanity, he either does not, or will not, perceive how much it is in a &s;en&s;ible woman's power to &s;upply her hu&s;band's deficiencies. He &s;ees not that
<PB N="98" REF="100">the connection is &s;o clo&s;e, the union of in|tere&s;ts &s;o perfect, that the merit of one par|ty mu&s;t reflect lu&s;tre on the other.</P>
<P>Our education gives us a certain &s;uperi|ority over the fair &s;ex; but they, on the other hand, po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;uperiority of a much higher nature&mdash;the noble &s;uperiority of virtue! In &s;ome things they are above us, in others on a level with us; in others again &s;weetly inferior: on the whole then, my dear Loui&s;a, balancing one qualification again&s;t another, I am of opinion that there is nearly an equality of merit between the &s;exes; and I am very &s;ure that he will ne|ver find happine&s;s in matrimony&mdash;that is, in its native &s;oil&mdash;who will not con&s;ider his wife as his equal, his companion, and his friend. Love &s;oon langui&s;hes and dies away, when it is not &s;upported and cheri&s;hed by friend&s;hip; and though a mutual regard can certainly &s;ub&s;i&s;t between per&s;ons of very different capacities, yet equality, though con&s;tituted&mdash;and perhaps it would be be&s;t it &s;hould be con&s;tituted&mdash;by different qua|lities, is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to true and con&s;ummate friend&s;hip. The warme&s;t, the
<PB N="99" REF="101">tendere&s;t, the mo&s;t delightful, and the mo&s;t durable affection, is the delicious <HI>melange</HI> of love and friend&s;hip: they &s;trengthen each other; love enlivens friend&s;hip, and friend|&s;hip refines love. Happy the man who has judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en his life's companion!&mdash; who finds the mi&s;tre&s;s and the friend united! In a word&mdash;for I cannot &s;uppre&s;s the fond boa&s;t&mdash;thrice happy Methuen!</P>
<P>It is with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure I reflect on my dear Marchmont's being &s;oon to en|ter on a &s;tate of felicity &s;imilar to my own. His affairs are in the be&s;t train imaginable. He wrote to Mi&s;s O'Bryen &s;ome days ago, to obtain permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her. I imme|diately prote&s;ted again&s;t his ra&s;hne&s;s in ven|turing abroad &s;o &s;oon. Mrs. Wentworth, with the mo&s;t tender and earne&s;t importu|nity, be&s;ought him not to go. <Q>But, my &s;weet &s;i&s;ter,</Q> cried he, pulling her on his knee, <Q>I mu&s;t go. How can you have the cruelty thus to compel me to contradict you? Oh! if you knew the half of what I feel&mdash;</Q>, putting her hand to his heart. <Q>As to Methuen, I won't li&s;ten to him; becau&s;e I am &s;ure,
<PB N="100" REF="102">if he were in my circum&s;tances, he would act ju&s;t as I do. What a tardy wretch Mi&s;s O'Bryen might think me!&mdash;a fro&s;ty-&s;pirited fellow, as I remember lady Conway once called me. Be&s;ides, I don't expo&s;e my&s;elf to any danger; I am perfectly well; look at me, Harriet?&mdash; Have I the lea&s;t appearance of a &s;ick man, except this vile <HI>robe de chambre?</HI></Q></P>
<P>"A compromi&s;e, Edward," &s;aid I; <Q>you may go to town, provided you wear that <HI>robe de chambre.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"O! not for a thou&s;and pounds!"</P>
<P>"And &s;o you'll throw it off," &s;aid Mrs. Wentworth, almo&s;t crying; <Q>and I know what will be the con&s;equence;&mdash;you'll get cold, and relap&s;e. My dear bro|ther," putting her arms round his neck, why will you be &s;o ob&s;tinate?</Q></P>
<P>He looked &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that I pi|tied him; and, winking &s;ignificantly at his &s;i&s;ter, gave it as my opinion, that he might go, if he would wear two wai&s;tcoats, two pair of &s;tockings, and &s;omething extraordi|nary about his neck. He was charmed
<PB N="101" REF="103">with my expedient; and ran up &s;tairs to write.</P>
<P>"Ah! my lord," &s;aid Mrs. Wentworth, <Q>why did you interpo&s;e? He was ju&s;t going to con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>I thoroughly &s;atisfied her, by explaining my intention; which was, that &s;he &s;hould &s;ecretly write to Mi&s;s O'Bryen, to forbid his coming. Accordingly our ha&s;ty lover was politely, and &mdash;both as to the intention and the manner&mdash;kindly repul&s;ed. She de&s;ired him to wait till the end of this week; &mdash;no di&s;puting her &s;overeign will;&mdash;he was obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The ardently wi&s;hed-for time draws near. He &s;ent ye&s;terday to let the duke of Gran|ville know, he &s;hould do him&s;elf the ho|nour to wait on him to-morrow. His grace returned a very polite card, reque&s;t|ing the favour of his company to dinner.&mdash; You will &s;uppo&s;e the invitation very agree|able; &s;o, in fact, it was; yet he will not accept it, but prefers dining at his own hou&s;e. Are you not amazed? But the cau&s;e is &s;till more &s;urprizing than the effect: &mdash;Mrs. Wentworth accompanies him. Her
<PB N="102" REF="104">fear that he will not take &s;ufficient care of him&s;elf, is her &s;ole motive for going. No|thing, I believe, but the pa&s;&s;ionate, and well-merited love &s;he bears him, could have induced the lovely reclu&s;e ever again to vi&s;it the gay metropolis. I wi&s;h &s;he could contrive to &s;hake off a little of her melancholy there; but I only <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> I do not in the lea&s;t <HI>expect</HI> it. Never did I &s;ee &s;o deep, and fixed a &s;orrow;&mdash;&s;uch calm de&s;pair. How am I pained, my Loui&s;a, when I behold this amiable young creature a prey to never-ending grief; and con&s;ider that <HI>my</HI> fatal imprudence was&mdash;in a great mea&s;ure, if not &s;olely&mdash;the cau&s;e of her &s;ufferings! Yet how far is her noble mind from re&s;enting the involuntary injury!&mdash; from di&s;claiming the friend&s;hip that has un|done her!&mdash;O, blind, mi&s;-judging Wentworth! how could you &s;u&s;pect &s;uch an angelic woman? And where did your imagination find the colours that drew me &s;uch a villain; for your own heart&mdash;yes, unfortunate man! my honoured, and much-lamented foe! your own heart&mdash;was good and generous, and, as much as mine, above
<PB N="103" REF="105">&s;uch wickedne&s;s? But why, my love, do I thus unnece&s;&s;arily di&s;tre&s;s you, by calling to your remembrance an event that has occa&s;ioned &s;o much affliction to us both.</P>
<P>I will write no more, for this &s;ubject has made me &s;ad, and I do not wi&s;h to make you &s;o. If I had &s;ufficient command over my&s;elf, I &s;hould never make you the part|ner of my griefs; but my heart is &s;o open to you, that it communicates all its feelings without di&s;tinction or re&s;erve.

<P>HUMAN bli&s;s is never without alloy, &s;ays the morali&s;t. The ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t; I &s;ub&s;cribe to it with a &s;igh. Doubtle&s;s, this is a right di&s;po&s;ition of things: were it otherwi&s;e, we &s;hould be apt to place our affections wholly on the happine&s;s of this world, without reflecting on its immen&s;e di&s;proportion to that of Heaven: and, God knows, this is what we are but too much inclined to do already.&mdash;"Marvellous!" you exclaim: <Q>a &s;ermon, in&s;tead of the gay flights I expected from him!

<PB N="105" REF="107">of others, cannot be happy him&s;elf:&mdash; and God forbid that he could!&mdash;Selfi&s;h happine&s;s!&mdash;there is no &s;uch thing: I can|not even frame an idea of it. And great, poignant as the angui&s;h is, with which my heart mourns my lovely &s;i&s;ter's woe, I would not barter the dear, painful &s;ympa|thy &mdash;I will not &s;ay for in&s;en&s;ibility, I would not barter it&mdash;for happine&s;s.</P>
<P>My &s;pirits are at pre&s;ent in a pretty exact equilibrium; though inclining, I believe, to melancholy: for if, on the one &s;ide, I am powerfully elated by my flattering re|ception at the duke of Granville's; on the other, I am &s;trongly depre&s;&s;ed by what I have &s;een my poor Harriet &s;uffer this day. 'T was above three years, you know, &s;ince &s;he had been in London before. When &s;he left this city, it was to attend the death-bed of a loved and honoured parent; a con&s;i|deration which, alone, would have been but too affecting to &s;o feeling a mind: but here, &s;he la&s;t &s;aw her adored, ill-fated hu&s;|band! This was too much for her to &s;up|port. I endeavoured all the way to divert her thoughts, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from
<PB N="106" REF="108">dwelling on &s;uch melancholy &s;ubjects. She was in tolerable &s;pirits till we came near town; her chearfulne&s;s then gradually &s;ub|&s;ided. I forced her to ta&s;te &s;ome wine, I had ordered into the chai&s;e on purpo&s;e to give her; and cau&s;ed the po&s;tillion to drive fa&s;ter, hoping that the quick motion would in &s;ome degree enliven her; or, at lea&s;t, &s;erve to di&s;turb her reflections. At length the tears, &s;he had no longer power to &s;up|pre&s;s, gu&s;hed from her &s;weet eyes. I put my arms round her, and laid her lovely face on my brea&s;t, without attempting to comfort her, otherwi&s;e than by joining my tears to her's. I was &s;everal times ap|prehen&s;ive of her fainting.</P>
<P>I made Bernard take a great round about, to avoid driving through the &s;treet in which my brother Wentworth had re&s;ided. At la&s;t the carriage &s;topped at my door; and I &s;upported, or rather carried, the dear mourner into a parlour.</P>
<P>I knew not what to &s;ay to her: a me|lancholy &s;peech might have increa&s;ed her &s;orrow; and I felt, that a &s;prightly one would have in&s;ulted it. I judged it be&s;t to
<PB N="107" REF="109">&s;trive to keep her from thinking at all. I brought her up &s;tairs, made her walk up and down the dining-room, with drawing-room, &amp;c.&mdash;a&s;ked her opinion of this, or that piece of painting, or furniture. I nei|ther expected, nor waited for an an&s;wer:&mdash; all I wanted, was to hurry the dear creature a little.</P>
<P>Will you think me a phlegmatic lover, my dear friend, when I own to you, that thus employed, I almo&s;t forgot my engage|ment? Harriet reminded me of it. I was extremely unwilling to leave her; and, feigning a head-ach, would have &s;ent an apology: but &s;he &s;aw through my little de|ception, and in&s;i&s;ted on my going, in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hewed me &s;he would be di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed by my per&s;i&s;ting to &s;tay with her.&mdash;I went.</P>
<P>As I enquired for the duke, I was &s;hewn into his &s;tudy. He received me, not only with civility, but kindne&s;s. We had chat|ted together above ten minutes, before I could find courage enough to&mdash;hope Mi&s;s O'Bryen was well; not that there was any thing in the duke's deportment, or
<PB N="108" REF="110">quality, that intimidated me. He does not appear to me that haughty man you think him; and if he were, his arrogance would be much apter to in&s;pire me with contempt than awe. I have been u&s;ed to conver&s;e with men of rank; and though I &s;hould think my&s;elf highly blameable, if wanting in due re&s;pect to them,&mdash;I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, were I &s;uffer that re&s;pect to dege|nerate into an aukward and unea&s;y fear. I do not con&s;ider my&s;elf &s;o far beneath even a duke, that it need at all dazzle my eyes to look up to him. There a is point of eleva|tion, which places a man on a certain de|gree of equality, with any rank below that of a &s;overeign prince. In &s;hort, my back|wardne&s;s to pay this nece&s;&s;ary compliment to my charming girl, aro&s;e entirely from the difficulty I find in pronouncing her name. You &s;mile,&mdash;you examine the con|&s;truction of the &s;yllables: <Q>O'Bryen!&mdash; O'Bryen!&mdash;a very ea&s;y name.</Q> Yes, Methuen, very ea&s;y to you, perhaps; but the mo&s;t difficult in the world to me. At la&s;t, however, I contrived to &s;tammer out this formidable name. His grace thanked
<PB N="109" REF="111">me: replied, &s;he was very well; and, ri&s;ing, &s;aid he would conduct me up &s;tairs: &mdash;<Q>I mu&s;t introduce you to my family, Sir Edward. I have two other grand|daughters that I am very proud of, I a&s;|&s;ure you; though I don't tell you, they are as hand&s;ome as Mi&s;s O'Bryen. There is not an old fellow in England,</Q> added he, &s;miling, <Q>can boa&s;t three &s;uch grand|daughters.</Q> You are quite in the right, thought I, if the two I have not &s;een, be any way equal to her I have.</P>
<P>O, how my heart fluttered as I walked up &s;tairs! But why need I take your lord|&s;hip any further. Your imagination will pre|&s;ent you with the interview. You will ea&s;ily fancy me introduced to the agreeable lady Cary&s;brook, and her two daughters; whom, by the way, I &s;hould have thought fine wo|men, had they cho&s;en their company a lit|tle more judiciou&s;ly: but they need not be a&s;hamed to yield to the &s;uperiority of the lovelie&s;t creature in the univer&s;e. You will imagine, my low, ob&s;equious bow, to the divine mi&s;tre&s;s of my foul, in&s;tead of the rapturous embrace my panting heart
<PB N="110" REF="112">would have dictated: but with this bow, I intreat you, connect not the attitude of Hudibra&s;s, nor the compliment with which he opens his &s;peech:&mdash;
<Q><L>"Madam, I do, as is my duty,</L>
<L>"Honour the &s;hadow of your &s;hoe-tie."</L></Q></P>
<P>You will imagine, too, the ro&s;e u&s;urp|ing the lily's place, on the mo&s;t beautiful face, the mo&s;t &s;educing bo&s;om, that ever the fair-proportioning hand of nature form|ed. Her fine black eyes half-rai&s;ed, &s;park|ling through their long &s;ilken la&s;hes; whil&s;t her harmonious voice, in &s;weetly trembling accents, expre&s;&s;ed her plea&s;ure at my reco|very.</P>
<P>Half an hour had elap&s;ed in general con|ver&s;ation, on indifferent &s;ubjects, when a number of vi&s;itors came in; a circum&s;tance that plea&s;ed me, as I have remarked people u&s;ually fall into parties in large companies; and I had already, in imagination, placed my&s;elf on the &s;ofa between lady Fanny Sed|ley and Mi&s;s O'Bryen. The timidity in&s;e|parable
<PB N="111" REF="113">from a love like mine, &s;till with|held me, when a &s;mart military figure put an end to my deliberation, by &s;eizing the object of it. I am a&s;hamed to tell you how much this di&s;appointment vexed me: and, you may believe, my chagrin was in no &s;mall degree increa&s;ed, when I &s;aw the cap|tain, determined to draw every advantage from his po&s;t, laying clo&s;e &s;iege to my little fortre&s;s. I aro&s;e; leaned over the back of the &s;ofa, and &s;ighed: that &s;igh pa&s;&s;ed not unheard, nor unpitied;&mdash;&s;he turned to me in&s;tantly, with a look of expre&s;&s;ive &s;weet|ne&s;s: &mdash;<Q>Shall we make room for you, Sir Edward?</Q> Then offering a pair of &s;ci&s;|&s;ars to the captain, &s;he &s;aid, with an air half plea&s;ant, half contemptuous,&mdash;<Q>Here, Sir, will you cut the cotton of lady Fanny's knotting?</Q></P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip, laughing, prai&s;ed her cou|&s;in's judgment in the employment &s;he had cho&s;en for him; prote&s;ting, that nothing could better &s;uit his delicate, white fingers. His vanity interpreted this piece of irony into a compliment; and, bowing with a &s;elf-&s;atisfied air, he moved nearer to lady
<PB N="112" REF="114">Fanny: while I, to my un&s;peakable plea|&s;ure, &s;at down between him and Mi&s;s O'Bryen. I began a mo&s;t delicious and intere&s;ting <HI>tete &agrave; tete</HI> with her; which, how|ever, he had &s;o far his revenge of me, as to interrupt every moment.</P>
<P><Q>Pray, ladies, were you at Drury-lane la&s;t night?</Q> &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"No, Sir."</P>
<P><Q>Ble&s;s me! you had the greate&s;t lo&s;s&mdash; The elegant colonel Bibton &s;at in one of the front boxes. You have &s;een him, I &s;uppo&s;e, madam?</Q> to Mi&s;s O'Bryen.</P>
<P>"Never, Sir."</P>
<P><Q>Then you have a great plea&s;ure to come. He is a perfect Adonis!</Q>&mdash;look|ing &s;ideways into a large pier-gla&s;s.&mdash;<Q>The fine&s;t eyes!</Q>&mdash;&s;urveying him&s;elf again&mdash; "The white&s;t teeth too!"&mdash;&s;tealing another look.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s O'Bryen, &s;miling, repeated the fol|lowing lines from Waller:&mdash;
<Q><L>"And when &s;he would another's prai&s;e indite,</L>
<L>"Is by her gla&s;s in&s;tructed how to write."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">
Lady Fanny pointed her &s;atire more di|rectly and &s;everely:&mdash;<Q>If yonder officer could &s;peak,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, pointing to the gla&s;s, <Q>he would certainly tell us, captain Wil&s;on is much hand&s;omer this colonel Bibton.</Q></P>
<P>A half coxcomb would have been out of countenance; but on our little warrior's</P>
<Q>"&mdash;brow, &s;hame was a&s;ham'd to &s;it."</Q>
<P>Vanity was his weapon, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, his &s;word and &s;hield; and did not more &s;urely expo&s;e him to the attacks of deri&s;ion, than effectually pre&s;erve him from being wounded by them. He was &s;o completely &s;tupified by conceit, that the raillery of the ladies, in&s;tead of hurting, &s;lattered him:&mdash;<HI>"Pardonez moi, me&s;dames;"</HI> bowing affectedly; <Q>very inferior, indeed, to colonel Bibton.</Q> In which probably he &s;poke the truth, though he neither be|lieved it him&s;elf, nor intended we &s;hould. He then, with a very bad grace, pronounced &s;ome di&s;qualifying &s;peeches; in which, by
<PB N="114" REF="116">the way, vain people always abound. We puni&s;hed him&mdash;and I think very properly&mdash; by not contradicting him.</P>
<P>I am not very certain whether his beha|viour &s;hould be attributed to &s;tupidity or a&s;&s;urance: mo&s;t likely, indeed, it was the re&s;ult of both. It would be equally unju&s;t and ill-natured, to call impudence the com|panion of dullne&s;s; but I may fairly a&s;&s;ert, that an impudent fellow is generally defi|cient in under&s;tanding; and mu&s;t, of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, be entirely devoid of that delicate mental feeling we call &s;entiment.</P>
<P>The captain &s;oon became tired of under|valuing him&s;elf to &s;o little purpo&s;e; and, by way of changing the &s;ubject, a&s;ked lady Fanny what u&s;e &s;he made of her knotting. She replied, <Q>It would an&s;wer for &s;everal purpo&s;es;</Q>&mdash;leaning a little forward, and looking, with an archne&s;s not to be de|&s;cribed, full in my charming Valeria's face, &s;he added, <Q>I de&s;ign this to trim Mi&s;s O'Bryen's wedding-gown.</Q></P>
<P>Surely, her lady&s;hip did here, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;acrifice both her delicacy and good-nature to her vivacity. I pitied my
<PB N="115" REF="117">blu&s;hing fair; but her di&s;tre&s;s was of too delicate a nature to admit of con&s;olation from me: I could only increa&s;e her con&s;u|&s;ion by appearing to ob&s;erve it. I turned away my admiring eyes, and began to talk to Wil&s;on. However inattentive I might &s;eem to the incident, I <HI>felt</HI> it!&mdash;Augu&s;tus, how bewitchingly hand&s;ome &s;he looked!&mdash; How lovely are tho&s;e effu&s;ions of mode&s;ty! How little did women of fa&s;hion know their own intere&s;t, when they bani&s;hed blu&s;hes from the <HI>beau monde!</HI></P>
<P>The recollection of my dear &s;i&s;ter's &s;itua|tion, obliged me to tear my&s;elf from my charmer's &s;ide. I whi&s;pered to her my in|tention, and its motive. "I leave you," &s;aid I, "&s;urrounded with admirers&mdash;" for by this time two or three gentlemen had gathered round her, with &s;uch an air of at|tention, of intere&s;t, that my fond, jealous heart, regarded them as rivals:&mdash;<Q>I leave you &s;urrounded with admirers,&mdash;O promi&s;e me that you will not li&s;ten to any of them, when I go away.</Q></P>
<P>"How can I make you &s;uch a promi&s;e?" demanded &s;he, with a &s;mile. I looked at
<PB N="116" REF="118">her with be&s;eeching fondne&s;s:&mdash;&s;he had the goodne&s;s to add,&mdash;<Q>My ear may li&s;ten, but my heart &s;hall not.</Q></P>
<P>The duke followed me to the door, and, in an obliging manner, expre&s;&s;ed his regret at my declining to &s;pend the day with him. &mdash;"I mu&s;t be paid with intere&s;t," &s;aid he, <Q>for relinqui&s;hing that claim. I &s;hall ex|pect to &s;ee you often, and without cere|mony: come to us <HI>en ami.</HI></Q> I thanked him in &s;uitable terms, and took my leave.</P>
<P>On my return home, I had the &s;atisfac|tion to &s;ee Harriet had a&s;&s;umed an air of tranquillity: but, alas! her &s;wollen eyes told me, it was bought with many tears.</P>
<P>Here is Philip come in, for the third time, to undre&s;s me. I have not the con|&s;cience to keep him waiting any longer. I told him to go to bed before, but he would not. Ever &s;ince my indi&s;po&s;ition, it is he that is ma&s;ter, not I. I mu&s;t not do this, nor wear that:&mdash;but a moment ago, he had the a&s;&s;urance to tell me, he would complain to Mrs. Wentworth of my &s;itting up &s;o late. Upon my word, I am finely documented between my &s;i&s;ter and my &s;er|vant.
<PB N="117" REF="119">Don't you think I &s;hall be hand|&s;omely tutored by the time I come into Mi&s;s O'Bryen's hands? If the dear crea|ture has a mind to tyrannize, I &s;hall have my le&s;&s;on of obedience pat.</P>
<P>I have really a great regard for this good|natured, officious Philip; and con&s;ider my|&s;elf highly indebted to him for his affection|ate behaviour. The care he took of me during my illne&s;s, &s;hall neither be forgot|ten, nor unrewarded. That illne&s;s, I &s;hall always remember with peculiar &s;atisfaction and thankfulne&s;s; as it was made the in&s;tru|ment to deliver me from a connection, which I can never think of without horror.</P>

<P>HOW does the thick, &s;moaky air of London agree with me, you a&s;k:&mdash;Sur|prizingly well; I am quite recovered with|in the few days I have pa&s;&s;ed here. How|ever, I believe I owe much more to the &s;ociety, than to the air of the place. I am every day at the duke of Granville's; and every day, with delight, read my welcome in my Valeria's &s;parkling eyes. I am really in danger of becoming the vaine&s;t coxcomb alive:&mdash;to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;uch an an|gelic creature!&mdash;a woman &s;o &s;uperior to all other women!&mdash;O, &s;he is
<Q><L>"&mdash;all that wi&s;h can claim,</L>
<L>"Cha&s;te pa&s;&s;ion cla&s;p, and rapture name."</L></Q></P>
<P>To be preferred to &s;uch a number of ri|vals! &mdash;many of them my &s;uperiors!&mdash;
<PB N="119" REF="121"><HI>Apropos;</HI>&mdash;jealous fellow, as you call me, I was right with re&s;pect to lord Wardour. The duke told me ye&s;terday, that his lord|&s;hip had reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to pay his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s O'Bryen. Heavens! how coldly &s;ome men can act in the&s;e affairs! I &s;hould never have thought of a&s;king &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion. I told the duke &s;o. He &s;aid, &s;miling, <Q>Then I ought, in ju&s;tice, to have preferred lord Wardour's &s;uit to your's. To own the truth, however, I believe my influence, had I been inclined &s;o to ex|ert it, would have &s;ignified very little. Valeria is extremely gentle: but I am mi&s;taken if &s;he be not, at the &s;ame time, extremely &s;teady.</Q></P>
<P>I took advantage of our being on this &s;ubject, to hint a de&s;ire to know, if I was to receive Mi&s;s O'Bryen from his grace, or Mr. Chetwynd. After a pau&s;e, during which he appeared di&s;turbed, he replied,&mdash; <Q>To deal frankly with you, Sir Edward, I have no title to an authority over her, though &s;he is my grand-daughter. Mr. Chetwynd has been a father to her, as &s;uch &s;he regards him: to him, therefore,
<PB N="120" REF="122">you are to apply. Valeria's mother, as you mu&s;t have heard, married again&s;t my con&s;ent: my re&s;entment&mdash;and in that, perhaps, I was to blame&mdash;de&s;cended to her. It was my fixed re&s;olution to con|&s;ider her as a &s;tranger to my blood. I &s;aw her&mdash;heard her&mdash;and my re&s;olution va|ni&s;hed. She is an irre&s;i&s;tible creature.</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;ure, if my looks were true to my heart, they gave a full a&s;&s;ent to his ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e, my dear &s;ir," continued the duke, <Q>you know that Sir William O'Bryen died in debt, and left his daughter&mdash;</Q>.</P>
<P>"Enough, my lord." cried I, with im|patience; <Q>I would not chu&s;e to receive a fortune with her.</Q></P>
<P>"And yet you &s;hould receive one," an|&s;wered he, <Q>had not Sir William, like the haughty man he was, made it the condi|tion of his la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to his daughter, that &s;he &s;hould never receive any thing from me. The re&s;triction, however, extends not to her children&mdash;</Q>.&mdash;I had actually the grace to redden at the
<PB N="121" REF="123">mention of children. He laughed at me; but quickly re&s;uming his gravity, went on to tell me, that he would &s;ettle an e&s;tate in Nottingham&s;hire, worth about a thou&s;and a year, on her elde&s;t &s;on; and twenty thou|&s;and pounds on her younger children; that he would appoint me tru&s;tee, and put me into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on my marriage.</P>
<P>Don't think me too romantic, Augu&s;tus, when I tell you, I am almo&s;t vexed to find &s;he will bring me a fortune. But, perhaps, &s;he will not think proper to accept her grandfather's offer. For my own part, I &s;ee little or no difference between his giving her a fortune in this manner, and the more u&s;ual one. It is in this light I have repre|&s;ented the matter to Mr. Chetwynd. I &s;hould be very glad to know her own opi|nion; but it would be altogether indelicate to &s;peak to her on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am to have the honour to accompany the duke's family to Granville-park to|morrow. It is no &s;mall addition to my &s;a|tisfaction, that my &s;i&s;ter is to be of the par|ty. It was with difficulty &s;he was prevailed on to go: the dear, romantic creature,
<PB N="122" REF="124">loves to indulge her &s;orrows in retirement; and &s;eems to think there would be a &s;ort of impiety, in enjoying any of the plea&s;ures of that world, of which her Henry is no longer an inhabitant. Lady Cary&s;brook, and lady Alicia Sedley, have quite won my heart by their attention to her. They appear to compa&s;&s;ionate her exceedingly, although they are ignorant of the peculiar na|ture of her misfortunes; and, with the re&s;t of the world, believe Mr. Wentworth's quarrel with you aro&s;e from a political di&s;|pute.</P>
<P>The Granville family pa&s;s this day at the duke of Avon's. My divine Valeria, and lady Alicia, have promi&s;ed Mrs. Went|worth to &s;up with her. It grows late: I begin to fear &s;omething may have hap|pened to prevent their coming: I &s;icken at the thought. I &s;hall &s;ee her to-morrow, to be &s;ure; but I expected to &s;ee her to-night, and I cannot bear to be di&s;appointed. My watch lies by me on the table,&mdash;I look more on it than on my paper.</P>
<P>How &s;oon do you think, Methuen, I may expect an an&s;wer from Mr. Chetwynd? I
<PB N="123" REF="125">&s;ent my letter to him by expre&s;s. Have I, do you imagine, any room to dread his di&s;approbation? Perhaps he is ambitious: he may have promi&s;ed his intere&s;t to &s;ome competitor of higher rank, or larger for|tune; and her gratitude and affection to him may&mdash;Away with the&s;e appre|hen&s;ions&mdash;The thought of lo&s;ing her is death to me.</P>
<P>Ah!&mdash;&s;he is come!</P>

<P>WHEN I carried off my mi&s;tre&s;s in tri|umph, from all the young <HI>noble&s;&s;e</HI> and beaux of London, I &s;ittle thought what a formidable rival I was to encounter in the country. Certainly nothing le&s;s than a duel can decide the conte&s;t. Remember, I en|gage you for my &s;econd.</P>
<P>Imagine, if you can, what mu&s;t have been my a&s;toni&s;hment, confu&s;ion, jealou&s;y, and rage, when, on our arrival here the other day, a young gentleman flew into my Valeria's open arms, hung round her &s;nowy neck, and imprinted a hundred ki&s;&s;es on her enchanting lips.</P>
<P>"Hold, ma&s;ter Sedley," cried I, <Q>do not quite &s;mother her, I intreat you.</Q></P>
<P>"Pray, &s;ir," demanded he, turning about with great quickne&s;s, <Q>are you mo&s;t careful of the lady, or jealous of me?&mdash; My &s;weet Valeria!</Q> again embracing

<P><Q>Could not you &s;ee that &s;he was hand|&s;ome,</Q> a&s;ked his mother, <Q>unle&s;s &s;he &s;hut her eyes?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;aw it very plainly, madam; I am not quite blind, I a&s;&s;ure you: but her eyes are &s;o bright, they dazzle mine; and I could not &s;ee if &s;he was entirely and exactly as beautiful now, as when &s;he went away.</Q></P>
<P>"Upon my word, Robert," &s;aid the duke, <Q>you have early applied your&s;elf to learn the important art of compliment|ing.</Q></P>
<P>"I think," &s;aid Mrs. Wentworth, <Q>he is already as good a proficient, as &s;ome who &s;eem to have made that art the chief &s;tudy of their lives.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="126" REF="128">
The little, bu&s;y, impertinent rogue, has &s;ome way or other found out my attach|ment to Mi&s;s O'Bryen; and you can have no notion how trouble&s;ome he contrives to make him&s;elf to me: he is continually in|terrupting our conver&s;ations, placing him|&s;elf between us, and &s;natching from me the plea&s;ure of rendering her many of tho&s;e lit|tle, trifling, namele&s;s &s;ervices, which are &s;o delightful to an enamoured heart to per|form.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter has ju&s;t now &s;urprized me ex|ceedingly:&mdash;&s;he has received letters from France, which inform her that Mi&s;s March|mont is going to be married to the marquis de St. Clair;&mdash;the very man, who&s;e &s;uit to Mi&s;s O'Bryen &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly forwarded.

<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>She has annihilated me! This St. Clair &mdash;this happy St. Clair!&mdash;was the favoured

<P>My friend, I am di&s;turbed&mdash;extremely di&s;turbed.

<P>WILL my dear Mi&s;s O'Bryen allow me, once more, to trouble her on Sir Edward Marchmont's account?&mdash;Read his let|ter, which I inclo&s;e.&mdash;I do not think it a breach of tru&s;t to communicate it, without his knowledge, to a per&s;on who has a much dearer intere&s;t in his heart, than I can boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>You need not be told, that my motive for acting in this manner, is to give you an opportunity of relieving my friend from an unea&s;ine&s;s, that a very refined mind only could feel from &s;uch a cau&s;e. Nature wrought Marchmont's &s;oul almo&s;t too deli|cate to bear the fini&s;hing touches of love;&mdash; that ma&s;ter-poli&s;her of the mind, has refined his to a nicety. There is a part of the world &mdash;and that not the &s;malle&s;t part&mdash;to whom that nicety would appear unaccountable, if not cen&s;urable or ridiculous; but if Mi&s;s

<P>I will not apologize for this, or any other trouble, my attachment to Sir Edward has prompted me to give you. I hope you think the cau&s;e of &s;ufficient importance to excu&s;e the effects. Be&s;ides, I &s;hall &s;oon have a &s;ort of claim to your friend&s;hip; which, believe me, I &s;hall con&s;ider as one of the highe&s;t advantages I derive from Sir Ed|ward's.</P>

<P>METHUEN, I thank you a thou&s;and times. She loves me!&mdash;me only! I am happy beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>La&s;t night, when I retired to my apart|ment, I had no inclination to go to bed; &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my &s;ervant, and extingui&s;hed the candles, preferring the fairer light of Cynthia, who &s;hone full into my windows. It came into my head to take a walk in the garden. My chamber opens to a gallery, from which there is a &s;tairca&s;e, that leads in|to it. I feared the door would be locked at that time of night, but had the &s;atisfac|tion to find it open. I &s;trayed up and down the walks for &s;ome time, wrapt in a plea&s;ing <HI>reverie.</HI> I admired the moon|beams &s;hooting through the trees, and playing tremblingly over the water. At length, I became weary of the folitary &s;cene; and, ca&s;ting a wi&s;tful eye towards
<PB N="132" REF="134">the hou&s;e, &s;ighed to my&s;elf&mdash;<Q>What a paradi&s;e, if &s;he was here!</Q> I went into a little arbour, to indulge my contempla|tions; but was &s;oon rou&s;ed by the noi&s;e of pa&s;&s;ing feet: they &s;topt; and I pre&s;ently heard my Valeria &s;ay, <Q>Let us go in here, Harriet, if you are not afraid of taking cold.</Q></P>
<P>My heart beat as if it would have forced it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age through my brea&s;t to meet her.</P>
<P>Harriet came in fir&s;t. "Don't be fright|ened, &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid I. She &s;creamed, not|with&s;tanding.</P>
<P>"What is the matter?" demanded her lovely companion, ru&s;hing in.</P>
<P>"Nothing, my &s;oul!" an&s;wered I, ea|gerly pre&s;&s;ing her hand to my brea&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>Indeed, brother, you &s;tartled me ex|ceedingly, Why, in the name of won|der, are you not in bed?</Q></P>
<P><Q>May he not a&s;k the &s;ame que&s;tion, in his turn?</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s O'Bryen.</P>
<P>"He may," replied Mrs. Wentworth; <Q>and I'll leave you to an&s;wer it, for I'm
<PB N="133" REF="135">afraid of &s;itting here. You will find me on yonder gravel walk.</Q></P>
<P>"We will go with you," cried Mi&s;s O'Bryen, ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"We will not," whi&s;pered I. Harriet went away without minding her.</P>
<P>I drew her to the &s;eat:&mdash;my bold, yet trembling arm, encircling her. <Q>Are you afraid of being alone with me?</Q> a&s;ked I.</P>
<P>With a &s;oftened voice, &s;he an&s;wered&mdash; <Q>No, indeed, Sir Edward, I am not; and I am glad I have met you, for I could not find an opportunity, the whole even|ing, of conver&s;ing with you on a &s;ubject &mdash;on a &s;ubject, that I don't know how to introduce.</Q></P>
<P>I was very de&s;irous to know what &s;ubject &s;he meant; but wi&s;hed fir&s;t to familiarize her to me, as I may &s;ay, by a little longer conver&s;ation, that &s;he might &s;peak with more ea&s;e and freedom. "Well," &s;aid I, <Q>you may fir&s;t tell me, as my &s;i&s;ter de&s;ired, what kept you up &s;o late.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Becau&s;e I could not &s;leep, while you &s;uffered any anxiety on my account.&mdash; You have no cau&s;e to be unea&s;y, Sir
<PB N="134" REF="136">Edward: believe me, I neither do, nor ever did, love the marquis de St. Clair.</Q></P>
<P>"Heavens! madam:" exclaimed I, in the utmo&s;t &s;urprize, <Q>how could you find out I was unea&s;y? I did not hint the matter even to my &s;i&s;ter; nor to any per&s;on, but a friend, who is not u&s;ed to betray me.</Q></P>
<P>"Lord Methuen has written to me," &s;aid &s;he: <Q>but do not call this betraying you; it de&s;erves a very different epithet. 'Tis fit that ordinary minds &s;hould, in dull &s;afety, run the circle cu&s;tom has marked out: but when a per&s;on unites &s;uch a heart as lord Methuen's, to &s;uch a head,&mdash;he is above rules, and mu&s;t be allowed to move a little eccentri|cally.</Q></P>
<P>You did not need her pretty apology, my dear Augu&s;tus. I immediately di&s;cern|ed the whole force of this <HI>tour d'ami.</HI></P>
<P>"Tell me, my life," cried I, <Q>tell me, &s;incerely, did you never love St. Clair?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Never, upon my honour. I will con|ceal nothing from you, Sir Edward.&mdash; I had a tender friend&s;hip for him;&mdash;a
<PB N="135" REF="137">friend&s;hip you'll allow me &s;till to retain. Had not our better &s;tars divided us, I can|not ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ert, that his charms and merit might not in time have made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on me; as my affections were entirely di&s;engaged, and I liked him bet|ter than any man I then knew.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I can never, never thank you &s;uffi|ciently, my Valeria, for this kindne&s;s&mdash; this conde&s;cen&s;ion&mdash;this amiable inge|nuity. Now, thou mo&s;t angelic wo|man!" &s;training her to my beating heart, complete my bli&s;s!&mdash;&s;ay, O, deign to &s;ay, that you love your adoring March|mont.</Q></P>
<P>Imagine with what rapture I li&s;tened, while, in half-formed accents, &s;he pro|nounced my happine&s;s! I ki&s;&s;ed&mdash;but half repul&s;ed, yet unreproved, with exta&s;y I ki&s;&s;ed&mdash;her balmy lips! Wild with tran|&s;port, I leaned my forehead on her bo&s;om! &mdash;the &s;ofte&s;t, faire&s;t bo&s;om, that ever heaved to the emotions of a feeling heart!&mdash;She &s;prang from me:&mdash;"Come," &s;ays &s;he, "Mrs. Wentworth will get cold."</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">
Both her own health, and my &s;i&s;ter's, were too precious to me, to &s;uffer me to endanger them, by &s;eeking to detain her.</P>
<P>I attended them to the foot of the &s;tairs, but would have forborn entering the hou&s;e with them, le&s;t, if any of the &s;ervants were &s;till up, and &s;hould chance to &s;ee us, they might make impertinent ob&s;ervations on the incident; but neither of the ladies would allow me to &s;tay out any longer.</P>
<P>I went to bed, but my thoughts were &s;o much engaged, I was not able&mdash;nor, in|deed, willing&mdash;to &s;leep till day-break: then the &s;oft god &s;trewed his poppies over my pillow; and my delighted fancy flew back to the charming night. Again I beheld my Valeria's matchle&s;s form; while the moon &s;hone re&s;plendent o'er our heads, and not a zephyr breathed upon the trees.</P>
<P>It was near eleven before Philip could find in his heart (that was his phra&s;e) to awaken me:&mdash;one would think the fellow knew my dreams.</P>
<P>I found all the family a&s;&s;embled in the parlour, except the duke, who u&s;ually breakfa&s;ts in his own apartment. My lovely
<PB N="137" REF="139">fellow-rakes had ju&s;t made their appearance; the re&s;t of the ladies had been down &s;tairs a good while: upon which, lady Fanny&mdash; who, I think, always finds &s;omething un|lucky to &s;ay&mdash;remarked, that one would imagine we three had been &s;itting up toge|ther. A con&s;cious blu&s;h over&s;pread the fine&s;t features in the world.</P>
<P>"Fanny," &s;aid lady Cary&s;brook, <Q>it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed you are the farthe&s;t from envy of any woman breathing, or you would not take &s;uch delight in heighten|ing Mi&s;s O'Bryen's beauty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I don't at all de&s;erve your lady&s;hip's compliment,</Q> returned &s;he, <Q>for I am far from thinking a blu&s;h the lea&s;t im|provement to any body.</Q></P>
<P>"I don't know," &s;aid Mrs. Wentworth, <Q>whether it may, or may not, be an ad|vantage to the complexion. I admire it, as the &s;ign of a quick and delicate &s;en&s;i|bility.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Fanny bri&s;kly replied, <Q>And I&mdash; excu&s;e me, Mrs. Wentworth&mdash;di&s;like it, as a &s;ign of ru&s;tic &s;implicity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140">
"Thank you for that, my dear," &s;aid Mi&s;s O'Bryen, bowing and &s;miling.</P>
<P><Q>Nay, upon my honour, I neither did, nor could mean to reflect on you: your good-breeding cannot be que&s;tioned. I a&s;&s;ure you, I have often wondered how you could contrive to unite &s;o much ea&s;e to &s;o much mode&s;ty. One would ima|gine, that a per&s;on of your qualifications, who had con&s;tantly frequented polite company, would be inclined rather to err on the &s;ide of a&s;&s;urance than ba&s;hful|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Alicia was of opinion, that there were many occa&s;ions, on which a blu&s;h was beautiful and becoming; but &s;aid, &s;he would readily condemn what the French called a <HI>mauvai&s;e honte.</HI></P>
<P><Q>If your lady&s;hip chu&s;es to adopt the French expre&s;&s;ion,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>I would humbly coun&s;el you, not to allow it the &s;ame latitude the French do: limit its &s;ignification as much as po&s;&s;ible; or your opinion perhaps may&mdash;though I am con|vinced your conduct never will&mdash;encroach on the borders of mode&s;ty. Allow me
<PB N="139" REF="141">to &s;ay, that ba&s;hfulne&s;s&mdash;or, if you plea&s;e, <HI>mauvai&s;e honte</HI>&mdash;is, in your &s;ex, much more amiable and engaging, than the lea&s;t tendency to the oppo&s;ite qua|lity.</Q></P>
<P>"You &s;peak very ju&s;tly, &s;ir," &s;aid lady Cary&s;brook: <Q>mode&s;ty is certainly a wo|man's chief ornament; and even an ex|ce&s;s of it, is at lea&s;t pardonable. Men, indeed, require &s;ome a&s;&s;urance&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>"O, an infinity, madam!" interrupted I, gaily, <Q>for if we don't &s;hew our&s;elves, the ladies will never be at the pains to draw us out. But, for us,&mdash;we do not love to have a woman's perfections too obvious; there is a plea&s;ure in the &s;earch after them, we do not willingly forego. It is an univer&s;al maxim among&s;t you, ladies, that men do not much prize what they obtain very ea&s;ily. You do not judge ami&s;s: we love a little difficulty; &mdash;but you mi&s;take the matter widely, when you make a mean and de&s;picable coquetry the &s;ource of our difficulties:&mdash; a man mu&s;t, in that ca&s;e, either give up the pur&s;uit, or his rea&s;on. It is &s;weet,
<PB N="140" REF="142"><HI>retiring</HI> mode&s;ty, that prompts us to <HI>follow;</HI>&mdash;mode&s;ty, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ing and lovely characteri&s;tic of your charming &s;ex, that mu&s;t ever enhance your value to us.</Q></P>
<P>"I would, by all means," &s;aid lady Fanny, <Q>have a woman mode&s;t; yet, I think, every body mu&s;t allow, that ba&s;hfulne&s;s often makes one appear in a very di&s;advantageous light.</Q></P>
<P>"Do not think &s;o," I an&s;wered:&mdash; <Q>Though ba&s;hfulne&s;s may &s;ometimes ob|&s;cure the full glare of your charms, the effect is as agreeable, as &s;hade to the light of a fine picture: or, I might bet|ter compare it to&mdash;the gauze with which you cover your bo&s;oms&mdash;</Q>, looking archly at her's;&mdash;<Q>and you know very well, that though we love to draw a&s;ide the veil our&s;elves, we &s;hould be highly di&s;gu&s;ted if you attempted to do it for us." She coloured, and called me im|pertinent.</Q> "You ought to thank me," &s;aid I, <Q>for you never looked hand&s;omer in your life. If you are wi&s;e, you will not quarrel with blu&s;hes. To tell you a

<P>SIR Edward, you have as much ro|mance as a girl of fifteen; and I like you for it. I do love the romantic; their hearts are warmed by the fire of their imagina|tions. Let cold, unerring rea&s;on, hold unre&s;i&s;ted &s;way in the becalmed brea&s;t of the philo&s;opher:&mdash;pa&s;&s;ion, generous pa&s;|&s;ion, mu&s;t animate the heart of that man, I could wi&s;h to call my friend. The virtues require a warm &s;oil;&mdash;I never knew them flouri&s;h in a cold bo&s;om. If the heart does not burn at twenty, I &s;hiver to think, what a frozen lump it will become at forty. If there be a young fellow in the world that could write coolly about &s;uch a girl as Va|leria, he de&s;erves to be hanged: or I'd burn the ra&s;cal, and &s;upply the want of in|ward, by outward heat.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">
I am a romantic fellow my&s;elf: indeed, you might have gue&s;&s;ed as much;&mdash;we are &s;eldom forward to prai&s;e a qualification that we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;or, at lea&s;t, that we do not imagine we po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;our&s;elves. I married a woman, who&s;e fortune was much &s;uperior to mine; but I loved her with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted tenderne&s;s:&mdash;had the wealth of the Indies been mine, I &s;hould have laid it at her feet.</P>
<P>My wife is a generous, romantic woman, who gave me her hand with ten thou&s;and pounds, when I had nothing but a curacy, and &s;ome uncertain expectations of church preferment, which I have &s;ince partly realized.</P>
<P>I give you this &s;ketch of our characters, to induce you the more readily to accede to our opinion, with re&s;pect to the duke's propo&s;al. We do no think there can be any &s;ufficient rea&s;on to oppo&s;e his doing ju&s;tice to his late mo&s;t amiable daughter, in the per&s;ons of her grandchildren: we do not think that, if Sir William O'Bryen him&s;elf was alive, he would object to it. When he, on his death-bed, became &s;en&s;ible that his ex|travagance
<PB N="144" REF="146">had ruined his child, he feared &s;he might have recour&s;e to the duke of Granville's protection; and no wonder that his pride was &s;o &s;everely wounded, at the thought of leaving her dependent on a man, who had always treated him with &s;uch unju&s;t contempt. But here the ca&s;e is widely dif|ferent; and the duke has little cau&s;e to tri|umph, in being permitted to &s;ettle on Sir William's grandchildren, what his daughter would not accept, and&mdash;I thank God!&mdash; does not need.</P>
<P>Allow me to tell you, &s;ir, that I exceed|ingly approve your naming a jointure, ra|ther than offering me <HI>carte blanche,</HI> as a per&s;on of ordinary genero&s;ity would have done. Very &s;en&s;ible you mu&s;t have been, that I neither could nor would have de|manded &s;o large a jointure. I admire, like|wi&s;e, the delicacy wherewith you hint your knowledge of Mi&s;s O'Bryen's not having a fortune: in that, however, you are mi&s;|taken. &mdash;Lady Enmore&mdash;who is now at my hou&s;e, and who&s;e paternal affection for Valeria gives her a right to know every
<PB N="145" REF="147">thing that concerns her&mdash;in&s;i&s;ts on pre&s;ent|ing her with five thou&s;and pounds on the approaching occa&s;ion; and will &s;ecure to her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very con&s;iderable e&s;tate, at her decea&s;e. Mrs. Chetwynd and I mu&s;t likewi&s;e give her five thou&s;and pounds at pre&s;ent; and which ever of us is the &s;urvivor, will certainly leave the re|mainder of our fortune to her.</P>
<P>I am not yet &s;o much of an old man, as not to know what mu&s;t be your pre&s;ent im|patience. I promi&s;e you &s;hall meet no unnece&s;&s;ary delays on my part. Mrs. Chetwynd and I are every day in anxious expectation of Mi&s;s O'Bryen's return:&mdash;I pre&s;ume you have not employed your time &s;o ill, as not to have already obtained per|mi&s;&s;ion to e&s;cort her. My dear Sir Edward, we &s;hall receive you as our friend&mdash;as our &s;on.</P>
<P>It would give me particular plea&s;ure, if Mrs. Wentworth could be prevailed on to favour us with her company. I need not &s;ay how much Mrs. Chetwynd de&s;ires it, as
<PB N="146" REF="148">&s;he is her&s;elf writing to Mrs. Wentworth on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince I am &s;o ready to give you my Valeria&mdash;the noble&s;t gift that could po&s;&s;ibly be pre&s;ented to any man&mdash;I hope you will not &s;o ill requite my genero&s;ity, as to &s;natch her from me immediately.&mdash;Don't be alarmed; I am not going to rai&s;e any ob|&s;tacles to delay your union; but I mu&s;t in|&s;i&s;t on your &s;taying three or four months afterwards. This is a point that I will not &mdash;I mean that I <HI>cannot</HI>&mdash;give up; for it is already almo&s;t a year &s;ince I have &s;een my darling girl; and I imagine you mu&s;t know the value of her &s;ociety too well, to won|der that I prize it as one of the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of my life.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t going to conclude, when ca&s;t|ing my eye over the paper, it &s;truck me that I ought fir&s;t to make &s;ome apology for this letter, which is certainly the mo&s;t unceremonious that ever was written on &s;uch a &s;ubject:&mdash;not a word of <HI>the ho|nour of your alliance,</HI> and &s;o forth.

<P><HI>VOUS vous trompez, mon ami;</HI> I am not at all jealous of lord O&s;more. Far from doing me any injury, he has really been of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to me: my Valeria, before, received my attentions with complacency, and di&s;couraged tho&s;e of others; but ever &s;ince his lord&s;hip came to Granville-park, &s;he has treated me with a preference &s;o marked, as to keep all other lovers&mdash;even the a&s;piring O&s;more him&s;elf&mdash;at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I was very near quarrelling with lady Fanny Sedley this evening:&mdash;as I was walking with her and Mi&s;s O'Bryen, I was pouring out my grateful heart in acknow|ledgments to the latter, for her generous and con&s;iderate behaviour with re&s;pect to lord O&s;more. Lady Fanny interrupted me, by &s;aying, &s;omething peevi&s;hly, <Q>I declare, Marchmont, you are the &s;tupide&s;t fellow I ever knew: I &s;hall ab&s;olutely die with

<P>"Pardon me," &s;aid I, &s;miling, <Q>I am very incon&s;iderate. I prote&s;t, I never thought of a&s;king my&s;elf the que&s;tion whether it was, or was not.</Q> This, you'll &s;ay, was not a very polite &s;peech: but nobody thinks of treating lady Fanny with much ceremony. People that &s;ay free things&mdash;e&s;pecially if they are as good-hu|moured as &s;he is&mdash;will always have free things &s;aid to them. She really is not bold, but her unguarded vivacity de&s;troys all dig|nity of character. Now, my Valeria, with all the ea&s;e even of a Pari&s;ian education, pre&s;erves, in her &s;prightlie&s;t moments, a delicate re&s;erve, that at once in&s;pires re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s.&mdash;But I wander.</P>
<P>"Rude creature!" &s;aid lady Fanny, in reply to me: <Q>lord O&s;more would not have &s;poken to me in this manner for the world; and yet I believe he is as fond of Mi&s;s O'Bryen, and as indifferent to me, as you can be.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152">
My charming girl &s;aid, with &s;ome warmth, <Q>lord O&s;more's politene&s;s differs from Sir Edward's, more in <HI>kind</HI> than in <HI>degree:</HI>&mdash; the one is acquired by education, and perfected by habit; the other evidently flows originally from the heart, and is but methodized&mdash;if I may &s;o expre&s;s it&mdash; by an acquaintance with the polite world.</Q></P>
<P>"You make nice di&s;tinctions," replied her lady&s;hip; <Q>but, for my part, if I find a per&s;on polite, I &s;hall never trouble my head to enquire, whether it be the re&s;ult of nature or education. Say what you will again&s;t lord O&s;more, he is a man quite to my ta&s;te: and, po&s;itively, I am mon&s;trou&s;ly angry with you for u&s;ing him &s;o cruelly as you do.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed, lady Fanny," &s;aid I, gravely, "I am not at all obliged to you for this."</P>
<P>"Don't mind the madcap," &s;aid Mi&s;s O'Bryen.</P>
<P><Q>Vain wretch! do I depreciate you, by prai&s;ing O&s;more?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not in the lea&s;t; your lady&s;hip mi&s;|takes me entirely: you are extremely
<PB N="151" REF="153">welcome to prai&s;e him, but not to re|commend him to Valeria's favour.</Q></P>
<P>"I did not do &s;o."</P>
<P><Q>You complain of that cruelty to him, which is certainly kindne&s;s to me; and, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> kindne&s;s to him would be cruelty to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not at all: &s;he might be kind enough to you both.</Q></P>
<P><Q>O, madam, if that be your way of thinking&mdash;</Q>. I &s;topt &s;uddenly. I believe I was going to &s;ay &s;omething too expre&s;&s;ive of the contempt I at that moment felt for her.</P>
<P>"My dear Fanny," &s;aid Mi&s;s O'Bryen, <Q>you are not a coquette: both your un|der&s;tanding and your heart, are too good to &s;uffer you to be one. Why, then, do you thus allow your ungoverned &s;pright|line&s;s to lead you to affect a character &s;o contemptible? Dete&s;table as affectation is, there may be &s;ome &s;en&s;e in endeavour|ing to appear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any prai&s;e-wor|thy quality; though there would be much more, in &s;triving really to acquire it:&mdash;
<PB N="152" REF="154">but what can be more wretchedly &s;illy, than to <HI>affect</HI> to be <HI>unamiable?</HI></Q></P>
<P>"How charming it is," I exclaimed, <Q>to hear &s;uch language flowing from the ro&s;y lips of youth and beauty! May rea|&s;on and virtue,</Q> added I, affectionately ki&s;&s;ing her hand, <Q>ever have &s;uch an advo|cate!</Q></P>
<P>"Now," cried lady Fanny, <Q>to be even with you both for this fine lecture, I &s;hall, in my turn, find fault with you, Valeria.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Find fault with her! How?&mdash;where? &mdash;what?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ha! ha! ha! I dare &s;ay you do not think &s;he has any faults at all.</Q></P>
<P>"I do not, upon my honour!" I replied, with empha&s;is.</P>
<P><Q>Why, to be ju&s;t, &s;he has le&s;s than mo&s;t people, or conceals them better; yet I could point you out a capital one; and that is in her conduct to lord O&s;more and your&s;elf. If &s;he di&s;likes him, &s;he ought to refu&s;e him, without letting him &s;ee it is for you he is refu&s;ed: by acting as &s;he
<PB N="153" REF="155">does, &s;he puts her&s;elf more in your power than is con&s;i&s;tent with prudence.</Q></P>
<P>I was exce&s;&s;ively hurt. My dear Valeria &s;aw that I was; and, with a look of tender confidence, &s;he laid her hand on mine: that little action, that &s;weet look, &s;poke more forcibly than words.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip re&s;umed her di&s;cour&s;e:&mdash; <Q>If any thing &s;hould happen to prevent your union, it would be an irreparable di&s;advantage to Mi&s;s O'Bryen, to have thus publicly favoured you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What di&s;advantage can it be to her, to be known to have &s;ome con&s;ideration for a man, who loves her almo&s;t to ido|latry? Should your cruel &s;uppo&s;ition be realized, yet &s;he would have no mortifi|cation to fear on that account;&mdash;I would publi&s;h my pa&s;&s;ion for her to the world&mdash; devote my life to her!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Very fine! But &s;uppo&s;e &s;he cho&s;e to marry &s;ome other gentleman, &mdash;how would he&mdash;</Q>.</P>
<P>"Ah! no more," &s;aid Mi&s;s O'Bryen; "I cannot bear to hear you talk thus."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156">
"Indeed, Valeria," replied the pro|voking creature, <Q>Sir Edward him&s;elf would value you more, if you treated him with a prudent re&s;erve.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This is pa&s;t enduring, madam:&mdash;how can you pretend to know my mind? I a&s;&s;ure you, if any thing could le&s;&s;en Mi&s;s O'Bryen in <HI>my</HI> e&s;teem, or induce me knowingly to forget <HI>her</HI>'s, it would be her changing that endcaring frankne&s;s, wherewith &s;he at pre&s;ent honours me, for that meanly &s;u&s;picious prudence you would inculcate. As &s;he has never, I flatter my&s;elf, had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to doubt my &s;incerity and honour, a re|&s;erved behaviour to me, could be dic|tated only by a very cold heart; and a cold heart, I am &s;ure, never was a good one. Believe me, I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my|&s;elf, were I ungenerous enough to at|tempt to take a liberty with any lady, which I &s;hould think the wor&s;e of her for &s;uffering;&mdash;and her I love, is the la&s;t woman on earth I could think of with indelicacy.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157">
"Still," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on it, ladies and gentlemen do not enter into the&s;e engagements on equal terms.</Q></P>
<P>"One would think," &s;aid my Valeria, <Q>you were talking of the di&s;po&s;itions for a battle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, madam; but &s;he is &s;triving to <HI>make</HI> di&s;po&s;itions for a battle. I thank her for it.</Q></P>
<P>"Really, child," addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Mi&s;s O'Bryen, <Q>you ought to con&s;ider, that if your uncle Chetwynd &s;hould with|hold his con&s;ent, or &mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>"Or what?" demanded I, angrily.</P>
<P><Q>Or if Sir Edward &s;hould for&s;ake you, you may probably be obliged to lead apes; whereas, he can get a wife when he plea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>"Whatever," &s;aid I, <Q>are your lady|&s;hip's de&s;igns, happily for me, you have avowed fentiments &s;o oppo&s;ite to the de|licacy and noblene&s;s of Mi&s;s O'Bryen's, that I am not at all afraid you will be able to prevail again&s;t me.</Q></P>
<P>"Valeria," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I'll be affronted with you the&s;e &s;even years to come, if
<PB N="156" REF="158">you don't revenge me for this cutting rebuke.&mdash;Shew him my advice has &s;ome effect on you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Excu&s;e me, my dear: &s;o far from in|terfering in your behalf, I mu&s;t tell you, that I think his reproof <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as ju&s;t as it is &s;evere. When lady Fanny acts up to her character, &s;he will find no per&s;on more ready to defend her intere&s;ts than I; but when &s;he chu&s;es to &s;ink &s;o much beneath it, &s;he is no longer the lady Fanny that I love.</Q></P>
<P>"This," &s;aid I, <Q>is the be&s;t &s;olution of per&s;onal identity I ever heard: &mdash;and re|member, lady Fanny, whenever you act thus perver&s;ely, I &s;hall con&s;ider you as a different per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>"On that footing," an&s;wered &s;he, <Q>let our di&s;pute end:&mdash;I &s;hall be <HI>my&s;elf</HI> again, as I &s;ee we are near the hou&s;e; for, I give you my word, all I &s;aid was only for the &s;ake of taking part in the con|ver&s;ation, which otherwi&s;e you would not have permitted me to do. When I have the misfortune to fall into the company of lovers, I always quarrel with
<PB N="157" REF="159">them, or &s;et them a quarrelling with one another;&mdash;'tis the only way a third per|&s;on can avoid being totally in&s;ignificant. &mdash;Well, are we friends, Sir Edward?</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, I'll not forgive you this week. And I'll complain of you to lady Alicia the moment we go in.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Fort bien, Mon&s;ieur;</HI> then I &s;hall look on you as my declared enemy this whole week; and accordingly, play you all the mi&s;chievous tricks I can think of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, no; let us be friends: I am half afraid of you, &s;ince I find you can be &s;o &s;piteful. I would not, for any con&s;ider|ation, be at enmity with you while lord O&s;more &s;tays.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh!" cried &s;he, <Q>it is the mo&s;t de|lightful thing imaginable, to have two lovers; they keep each other in &s;uch ex|cellent order. When a man has no rival, he a&s;&s;umes &s;o many &s;aucy or negligent airs, there is no bearing him. If ever I have one over, and can't get a fellow for him, I'll certainly di&s;card him: I would rather go barefooted, than walk with one &s;hoe.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160">
We &s;hook hands in token of perfect amity; but the moment we returned to the drawing-room, the little urchin found means to &s;et me down to piquet with the duke. I told her in a whi&s;per, I con&s;idered this as an ab&s;olute breach of our new-made treaty of peace. "With all my heart:" returned &s;he; <Q>you may begin ho&s;tilities as &s;oon as you dare.</Q></P>
<P>When I was relea&s;ed from the card-table, I &s;tept up to lord O&s;more, and begging him to humour whatever I &s;hould &s;ay to lady Fanny, I went over to her, and in a low voice intreated her to walk to the other end of the room with me: quite un&s;u&s;picious of my de&s;ign, &s;he complied; and I lead her directly to O&s;more. <Q>You &s;ee, my lord, I keep my promi&s;e with you, in giving you an opportunity to thank this lady for the very favourable &s;entiments, I have this evening been &s;o fortunate as to di&s;|cover, &s;he entertains for you.</Q> She looked quite &s;urpri&s;ed and confounded.</P>

<P>"I declare I could beat you," cried &s;he, in a violent pet.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered with profound gravity, <Q>I &s;hould be mi&s;erable if I thought your lady&s;hip was really offended at my offi|cious zeal.</Q></P>
<P>"And I," &s;aid O&s;more, <Q>&s;hall be the mo&s;t unhappy of men, &s;hould &s;he have the cruelty to doubt&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>She will be as good as her word, I dare &s;ay.</P>
<P>"Madam," replied I, <Q>I under&s;tand you perfectly; nobody is quicker at tak|ing a hint:&mdash;but be per&s;uaded, I have

<P>"Generous creature!"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t generous!" echoed his lord&s;hip; <Q>I am overpowed with gratitude&mdash;I have not language&mdash;This kind parti|ality was as little expected, as de&s;erved.</Q></P>
<P>"Sure," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>it is not po&s;&s;ible you can believe any thing, this abomi|nable, malicious wretch, has told you? My lord, I mu&s;t let you know how this matter comes about&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>SO, Mrs. Wentworth denies all know|ledge of the Chevalier du Mornai:&mdash; &s;trange!&mdash;That he knows her too well, I am &s;ufficiently convinced.&mdash;Something that happened this morning, increa&s;es my cu|rio&s;ity and &s;urprize:&mdash;Sir Francis O'Bryen and the chevalier, breakfa&s;ted here. The conver&s;ation turned on Mrs. Hervey:&mdash;I believe you remember &s;eeing her at the earl of Melmont's&mdash;&s;he lo&s;t her hu&s;band about three months ago; her grief was &s;o extravagant, as to put her friends in fear of her attempting to de&s;troy her&s;elf: however, &s;he changed her mind; and was la&s;t week married to a Mr. Wal&s;h; a man every way her inferior.&mdash;Sir Francis made many gay ob&s;ervations on her conduct; and in his u&s;ual lively way, went on to &s;ay, that wo|men never lament the lo&s;s of <HI>the</HI> hu&s;band, but the want of <HI>a</HI> hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">
"I hope," &s;aid Mr. Chetwynd, <Q>it will &s;oon be in my power to introduce you to a lady, in who&s;e favour you will be obliged to give up that notion. What do you think, Francis, of a beautiful widow of two and twenty, with an im|men&s;e fortune, devoting her&s;elf to &s;oli|tude and celibacy?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Faith! Sir, 'tis very extraordinary; &s;o much &s;o, that I am &s;ure it can't la&s;t long.&mdash;You &s;aid that you expected the lady here?</Q></P>
<P>"Yes; very &s;oon."</P>
<P>"Then, uncle," tapping him on the knee, "&s;he is the very woman for me."</P>
<P>"You do not know her," &s;aid I, <Q>or you would re&s;pect her &s;orrows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your pardon, madam, I have done. Only&mdash;her name?</Q></P>
<P>"Harriet Wentworth."</P>
<P>A chocolate cup dropt from du Mornai's hand upon the floor: and faintly exclaim|ing, "my God!" he fell back in his chair. He remained for &s;ome minutes in&s;en&s;ible. As &s;oon as he recovered, he made &s;ome excu&s;es&mdash;awkwardly enough, I thought&mdash;
<PB N="165" REF="167">for the trouble he &s;uppo&s;ed he had given: &s;aid, that his health was bad; and he was &s;ubject to the&s;e &s;udden fits.&mdash;Yes, thought I, when Mrs. Wentworth is &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Certainly, my dear Valeria, this is a mo&s;t my&s;terious and perplexing affair. I feel extremely for the poor chevalier. I am per&s;uaded, he is deeply unhappy. On a nearer acquaintance, I find him exceed|ingly amiable. His <HI>abord</HI> is &s;o very cold, that it almo&s;t freezes one; but by degrees the re&s;erve wears off, and allows you to pay due e&s;teem to his worth,&mdash;He &s;peaks Engli&s;h remarkably well for a foreigner; indeed, quite as well as a native. He ge|nerally pre&s;erves a thoughtful and gloomy &s;ilence; but when he chu&s;es to talk, his conver&s;ation&mdash;though always grave&mdash;is un|commonly &s;en&s;ible and entertaining.</P>
<P>Don't you think it was &s;omething extra|ordinary in him, to cry out, "my God!" &s;hould he not rather have &s;aid, <HI>mon Dieu?</HI> In a &s;udden and violent agitation of the mind, it is mo&s;t natural and cu&s;tomary to u&s;e one's own language.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168">
I cannot get this man out of my head: but I would not have you mention him to Mrs. Wentworth any more, le&s;t it might prevent her coming here; and I earne&s;tly wi&s;h to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>The moment I received yours, I wrote to lady Alicia. Her de&s;ire of accompany|ing you is extremely obliging; and the ready acquie&s;cence of the duke and lady Cary&s;brook, is very flattering both to you and us.</P>

<P>LORD O&s;more left us this morning. The precipitance of his departure was, I believe, partly occa&s;ioned by a whim&s;ical little incident I will recount to you:&mdash; Chancing to ri&s;e this morning earlier than u&s;ual, I intended to take a ramble before breakfa&s;t; but finding it rained, I changed my mind, and the door of the breakfa&s;t-parlour &s;tanding open&mdash;I &s;troled in. My Valeria alone&mdash;&s;tanding at a window, writ|ing carele&s;sly with a pencil on the margin of a new&s;paper.&mdash;I &s;tole behind her.&mdash;She had written' "Valeria O'Bryen," and un|der it, "Valeria Marchmont."&mdash;I caught the betwitching charmer in my arms. "Oh! Sir Edward!" Then ha&s;tily, and in extreme confu&s;ion, &s;he would have ef|faced the pretty &s;cribble. I pulled her away; embracing her with tran&s;port. She hid her lovely, blu&s;hing face on my

What a &s;ight for him! it pains me to reflect on what he mu&s;t have &s;uffered. At the time however, I felt only for my Vale|ria; &mdash;I gave her a pretence to retire, by &s;aying aloud, <Q>Tell me, you forgive me; and I'll not detain you any longer.</Q></P>
<P>"I thank you," &s;aid &s;he, in a low voice; and hurried away.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming an air of unconcern, I &s;aid, "Your lord&s;hip is an early ri&s;er this morn|ing."</P>
<P><Q>So are you, Sir, I perceive. I be|lieve we ri&s;e early from a very different cau&s;e:&mdash;you are too happy, I am too mi&s;erable, to &s;leep.</Q></P>

<P>I mu&s;t tell you &s;ome news, I have heard from good authority &s;ince I came down here:&mdash;Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, my old flame&mdash; though, Lord knows, &s;he never warmed me much&mdash;is going to be married to Sir Peter Ball; a poor city knight; who, I &s;uppo&s;e, is very glad there &s;hould be a mutual participation of his title and her fortune. I think knights are quite her game: yet I would fain think, we are not ea&s;ier taken in, than any other &s;et of men. You &s;ee &s;he is determined to be a <HI>lady</HI> at any rate; and that, as Sir Peter is con&s;i|derably on the wrong &s;ide of fifty, mu&s;t, I pre&s;ume, be her principal inducement to wed him. I am afraid it would not be very uncharitable to conjecture, by his age, that

<Q><L>"Vieillards qui deviendrez maris,</L>

<P>Poor Sir Peter! Whenever I call to mind &s;ome late occurrences, I find my&s;elf exceedingly inclined to compa&s;&s;ionate any man I think in danger of Acteon's fate. <HI>A propos</HI>&mdash;Pray, my lord, is it not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that the godde&s;s of cha&s;tity, and ladies who are not, Heaven knows, very famous for that virtue,&mdash;&s;hould have fixed upon the &s;ame mode of puni&s;hing our hap|le&s;s &s;ex?</P>
<P>I have another piece of intelligence to communicate: you perceive I am quite a news-monger to-day:&mdash;Sir James Conway has let his e&s;tate here to Mr. Domville; who, ever &s;ince his marriage, has been fluctuating between Ireland, France, and England. I find he intends to &s;ettle here; &s;o I &s;hall exchange a very unde&s;irable neigh|bour, for a very agreeable one.</P>
<P>The two days I have been obliged to &s;pend here, have appeared to me in&s;uffer|ably
<PB N="173" REF="175">tedious. The day is, undoubtedly, three times as long here as at Granville|park.&mdash;I go to London to-morrow; where I expect to di&s;charge as much bu&s;ine&s;s in one day, as would take me up four, at ano|ther time. Then away to Granville-park &mdash;which has more charms for me, at pre|&s;ent, than any other place in the world. From that I &s;hall go to Poplar-hill: I be|lieve my &s;i&s;ter will accompany me; as I am &s;ure &s;he is de&s;irous to &s;ee lady Methuen before our excur&s;ion to Ireland, which is fixed for next week. I was afraid &s;he would not have con&s;ented to undertake this little voyage: but her gentle temper could not with&s;tand Mrs. Chetwynd's pre&s;&s;ing in|vitation, which was equally friendly and polite; joined to Mi&s;s O'Bryen's per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, and my earne&s;t &s;olicitations.&mdash; It would have thrown a &s;hade of regret over my joys, to have left this &s;weet, me|lancholy creature, unprotected and alone. &mdash;If my love for my Valeria could admit of any heightening, it would receive it from her tenderne&s;s to this dear, unfortunate fi&s;ter; who hangs about my heart, in a
<PB N="174" REF="176">manner I cannot de&s;cribe. How clo&s;ely does pity tie the band of friend&s;hip!</P>
<P>Tell my dear lady Methuen, I long to &s;ee whether your daughter or Arthur has <HI>grown</HI> mo&s;t, &s;ince I was at Poplar-hill: there was then, I remember, a powerful emulation between them; though their am|bition was &s;omewhat differently directed; &s;he aiming entirely at bulk, and he chiefly at height.</P>
<P>O, Methuen, how oppo&s;ite is my pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, to that in which I la&s;t vi&s;ited your amiable family! Crooked and thorny was my path to happine&s;s; but I have ar|rived at it!

<P>THIS is my third letter from Ireland: you &s;ee you are getting deep into debt: I warn you, you will find me a mo&s;t merci|le&s;s creditor. My fir&s;t from Dublin, I pre|&s;ume, you have received by this time.&mdash; The ladies are perfectly recovered of their little fatigue: and we are all as well and as happy as po&s;&s;ible at Chetwynd|villa.</P>
<P>Our agreeable fellow - travellers, Mr. Domville and lady Lucy, are &s;till at lord Melmont's hou&s;e in Dublin; but are to-mor|row expected at Firdale, a &s;eat of his lord|&s;hip's, within &s;ix or &s;even miles of this place.</P>
<P>I am charmed with my future relations: &mdash;they already treat me <Q>as their friend&mdash; as their &s;on.</Q>&mdash;With Mrs. Chetwynd I am almo&s;t as much in love, as with her
<PB N="176" REF="178">beautiful niece. She is &s;till extremely agree|able in her per&s;on, though I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he mu&s;t be about forty. Her under&s;tanding is very good; and her conver&s;ation and manners evidently &s;hew a perfect know|ledge of the <HI>grand monde.</HI> But what prin|cipally attracts me, is the affectionate &s;en&s;i|bility of her heart; which is ea&s;ily di&s;cerni|ble to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver. There is a tenderne&s;s&mdash;an air of intere&s;t, in her behaviour to any per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, that is un&s;peakably plea&s;ing and amiable: I have &s;een tears in her eyes as &s;he &s;urveyed my &s;i&s;ter; to whom her whole behaviour&mdash;as, indeed, that of every individual of this fa|mily&mdash;is a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attentive and obliging.</P>
<P>Mr. Chetwynd is a &s;en&s;ible, and mo&s;t worthy man. His temper is warm, even to enthu&s;ia&s;m. The fire of the man is catching;&mdash;I frequently feel my heart glow as I conver&s;e with him.&mdash;From this warmth of di&s;po&s;ition proceed mo&s;t of his virtues, and all his faults: here I may ju&s;tly apply a line of that character, &s;o admirably drawn by Gold&s;mith,</P>
<Q>&mdash;Ev'n his failings lean to virtue's &s;ide.</Q>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">
He can hardly behave with common ci|vility to a man he de&s;pi&s;es; he would &s;corn to take off his hat to a &s;coundrel, though he lolled in a coach adorned by a coronet; &mdash;but he would kneel in the dirt to ki&s;s the hand of an hone&s;t man in rags.&mdash;Do not figure to your&s;elf a &s;our cynic, &s;narling at the world:&mdash;no man is more ready to overlook any errors that do not flow from the depravity of the mind. He is polite, frank, ho&s;pitable, &s;prightly, and good-hu|moured; enjoying the world freely, but enjoying it with rea&s;on and innocence; and quarrelling as much with the meanne&s;s, as with the &s;infulne&s;s of vice. In &s;hort, I never yet knew a heart, every way &s;o to|tally uncorrupted by five-and-forty years commerce with the world.</P>
<P>Such are the parents of my Valeria,&mdash; for it is in that light &s;he con&s;iders them; and mo&s;t gladly &s;hall I render them the duty and affection of a &s;on.

<P>I told her&mdash;that I had &s;een her at Paris with lady Marchmont: that I there imbibed for her a pa&s;&s;ion, which marked my future days with woe.&mdash;I had been married by my father, when I was extremely young, to a woman for whom I never had the lea&s;t af|fection: this unfortunate engagement put it out of my power to declare my love for her.

He informed me Mi&s;s Marchmont was al|ready married!&mdash;This dreadful and unex|pected &s;troke was near depriving me of my exi&s;tence.

<P>Such, in brief, was the purport of an addre&s;s, every way calculated to &s;ooth the vanity of her &s;ex. It agrees very well with the di&s;order, the mention of her fatal name excited in me; and of which, I doubt not,
<PB N="189" REF="191">&s;he has been informed.&mdash;The real agitation of my mind, and the mixture of truth con|tained in this fiction&mdash;gives, I think, an air of &s;incerity to the whole.</P>
<P>You will a&s;k me why I wrote:&mdash;I can|not tell you; I had no &s;ort of purpo&s;e to an&s;wer by it; I was actuated by an impul&s;e I could not re&s;i&s;t.

<P>GRACIOUS Heaven! my dear friend, what an amazing tale have I to un&s;old!&mdash; Should I tell you that Harry Wentworth lives,&mdash;will you not believe that I rave, or that I mock you? Yet, I have received a letter from him within this half hour. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the emotion the peru&s;al of it gave me. With what aftoni&s;h|ment, what tumultuous joy&mdash;joy checked by doubt&mdash;did I regard it! My head grew dizzy; and my behaviour, I believe, was ab&s;olutely frantic. By an impul&s;e almo&s;t involuntary, I flew to the dear partner of my &s;oul:&mdash;her &s;oothing &s;oftne&s;s has, in &s;ome degree, compo&s;ed my agitated &s;pirits; yet &s;till my heart beats &s;trangely, and my blood &s;eems to circulate in an unu&s;ual way. &mdash;I was in my own chamber when the let|ter was brought to me; and having heard
<PB N="199" REF="201">Mi&s;s O'Bryen enter her's, without reflect|ing on the boldne&s;s and impropriety of &s;uch an intru&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>The carriage waits&mdash;Imagine with what impatience I go to embrace my long-lo&s;t brother.</P>
<P>I &s;hall reque&s;t my Valeria to add a few lines, and &s;eal this.&mdash;She knows that I have already told you every thing relative to this pretended Frenchman's addre&s;&s;es to my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>I e&s;teem my&s;elf &s;ingularly fortunate, to have at once an opportunity of te&s;tifying my &s;en&s;e of the favours I have received from lord Methuen, conveying plea&s;ure to him, and obliging Sir Edward Marchmont. &mdash;Your lord&s;hip will lo&s;e by the change of your corre&s;pondent.&mdash;But it would be un|pardonable to tire you with tedious apolo|gies, in&s;tead of entering immediately on a &s;ubject &s;o intere&s;ting to you. Where am I to take it up? Let me &s;ee.&mdash;At my own room door, I think.&mdash;I had ju&s;t &s;at down to write to Mi&s;s Marchmont, when I heard a ha&s;ty
<PB N="200" REF="202">tap at my door. "Come in, Sir," &s;aid I, &s;uppo&s;ing it was my uncle; and ri&s;ing, I walked towards the door:&mdash;I was extreme|ly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it opened by Sir Edward. He cla&s;ped me in his arms without &s;peak|ing a word: he was in violent di&s;order; and changed colour every in&s;tant. <Q>My God!</Q> cried I, <Q>what is the matter? &mdash;You are ill!&mdash;O &s;it here</Q>&mdash;I led him to a large elbow-chair as I &s;poke: he &s;at down, and placed me be&s;ide him; &s;aying, with great emotion, <Q>O, Valeria! my &s;i&s;ter</Q>&mdash;He laid an open letter on my lap; and bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;I cannot ex|pre&s;s how much he frightened me:&mdash;Har|riet had gone out a little before to take the air with lady Enmore;&mdash;an over-turned carriage, and broken limbs, were the fir&s;t ideas that ro&s;e in my mind;&mdash;I gra&s;ped his hand in &s;peechle&s;s terror.&mdash;<Q>I have di&s;|compo&s;ed you, my love,</Q> &s;aid he: <Q>How could I be &s;o thoughtle&s;s?

<PB N="201" REF="203">What a &s;udden tran&s;ition from affliction to joy!&mdash;But, my lord, it will be a great deal more to the purpo&s;e, to give you &s;ome ac|count of the letter it&s;elf, than to attempt to tell the effect it had, either on my&s;elf or on Sir Edward.&mdash;It is written in a &s;tyle I can|not do ju&s;tice to: irregular, elevated, warm, and pathetic. After mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately la|menting the pain his unworthy &s;u&s;picions occa&s;ioned to his Harriet&mdash;&s;everely con|demning him&s;elf, for giving way to thoughts &s;o injurious to her&mdash;earne&s;tly begging his brother's forgivene&s;s&mdash;and generou&s;ly prai&s;ing the candour of the writer of the little narrative Sir Edward &s;o fortunately &s;ent to him&mdash;he proceeds to applaud your lord&s;hip's behaviour in your unhappy duel: he &s;ays, you in the gentle&s;t, though mo&s;t intrepid manner, ineffectually demanded what cau&s;e of offence you had given; and refu&s;ed to fight, until provoked by the mo&s;t opprobrious language.&mdash;When you fell bleeding and &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground, he thought you dead; yet &s;till animated by a furious re&s;entment, he was going to &s;tab you through the heart; but every feeling
<PB N="202" REF="204">of the man and the gentleman, ri&s;ing again&s;t &s;o ba&s;e an action, he threw away the bloody &s;word with horror, and precipitately quit|ted the place.</P>
<P>He embarked on board a merchant &s;hip bound to Cadiz; taking with him bills on that city to the amount of about two thou|&s;and pounds: this &s;um he thought would be &s;ufficient for a year or two; and his me|lancholy imagination naturally enough &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that he could not &s;urvive his mis|fortunes beyond that time.</P>
<P>He was received with all the friend&s;hip he expected by Don Juan d'Almagro; to whom he di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret cau&s;e of his voluntary exile. The jealous, haughty, vin|dictive temper of the Spaniard, highly ap|proved his conduct; and confirmed him in his re&s;olution of e&s;tranging him&s;elf for ever from England.&mdash;Sir Edward's enquiry em|barra&s;&s;ed them very much: neither were willing to acknowledge the truth; both &s;corned a lie; and Don Juan's politene&s;s re|jected the idea of leaving the letter unan|&s;wered. An accident at length determined them; and induced them to adopt as wild
<PB N="203" REF="205">a &s;cheme as ever a romantic brain &s;ug|ge&s;ted: truth, they relunctantly obliged to give way to a &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;Mr. Wentworth's &s;ervant was thrown from his hor&s;e, and died in a few days after of his brui&s;es and a fever, which was their con&s;e|quence. During his illne&s;s, he expre&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;trong a concern at the thought of being buried in a foreign country, that his ma&s;ter humanely promi&s;ed, that if he died he would be at the expence of having him conveyed to England. The &s;equel is ea&s;ily ima|gined: &mdash;Mr. Wentworth, to put a final &s;top to the enquiries of his friends, thought fit to make the corps pa&s;s for his own; and dictated to Don Juan that letter, which drew &s;o many tears from the faire&s;t eyes in England. This &s;trange deceit was not ea&s;ily detected: the body of a per&s;on dying in &s;uch circum&s;tances would be expected to be altered and disfigured; and this man, though unlike him in bulk and complexion, was about his age, nearly of the &s;ame &s;ta|ture, had &s;ome re&s;emblance in his features, and hair of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206">
Some time after this, from a re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, he left Cadiz; and, as he him&s;elf phra&s;ed it, when he wrote in his a&s;&s;umed character to Mrs. Wentworth&mdash; <Q>rambled over mo&s;t part of Europe, hope|le&s;s of happine&s;s, and wholly regardle&s;s of life.</Q></P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing one night through the &s;treets of Rome, he &s;aw a young gentleman leaning his back again&s;t a wall, defending him&s;elf with great bravery again&s;t three men. Our generous unfortunate immediately drew his &s;word, in aid of the per&s;on who fought &s;o unequal a combat:&mdash;the da&s;tardly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were &s;oon put to flight.&mdash;Mr. O'Bryen&mdash; for you will gue&s;s it was he&mdash;thanked his deliverer in the warme&s;t terms.&mdash;<Q>You owe me nothing,</Q> returned Mr. Went|worth gravely: <Q>I am happy to have a&s;|&s;i&s;ted to pre&s;erve <HI>your</HI> life; and only wi&s;h I had been fortunate enough to have lo&s;t my own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! Signior, I fear you are unhappy: if by my fortune, my friend&s;hip, my life it&s;elf, I can render you any &s;ervice, freely command me.</Q></P>

<Q>My misfortunes are not of a nature to admit of remedy. At pre&s;ent, how|ever, I think of nothing but your &s;afety: allow me to attend you.</Q></P>
<P>Such an incident as this naturally led to an intimacy between them. O'Bryen was of a temper too grateful and generous, not to &s;eek to return &s;o great an obligation: but the re&s;erve of the man he wi&s;hed to oblige, put it out of his power to do more than endeavour to divert a melan|choly, of which he knew not the cau&s;e. Though Mr. Wentworth's mind was &s;oured by misfortune, he could not long be in&s;en|&s;ible to &s;uch attention;&mdash;the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip was quickly founded on the &s;trong ba&s;is of mutual worth and mutual gratitude: the fulle&s;t confidence &s;oon &s;uc|ceeded. They became in&s;eparable compa|nions; vi&s;ited &s;everal places in Italy toge|ther; and when Sir John O'Bryen's death called home his &s;on, he found means to per&s;uade his friend to accompany him: though not without much difficulty; and after repeatedly urging the improbability of his being known, under the di&s;gui&s;e of
<PB N="206" REF="208">a Frenchman, in a kingdom where he had never been; e&s;pecially as his perfect know|ledge of the French nation and language gave him no room to apprehend &s;u&s;pi|cion.</P>
<P>You know all the re&s;t, my lord;&mdash;I have only to tell you, that Mr. Went|worth and Sir Francis O'Bryen left Cork immediately on the receipt of Sir Ed|ward's letter, and late la&s;t night returned to O'Bryen ca&s;tle; where Sir Edward is now gone.&mdash;I pre&s;ume he will return to|night, as the di&s;tance is not more than eight miles.</P>
<P>It is well Mrs. Wentworth happened to be abroad this morning:&mdash;our exce&s;&s;ive joy might have betrayed more than it would be proper for her yet to know. I dread the con&s;equences of a full di&s;covery: &mdash;but we mu&s;t be cautious, and hope the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I will bid you adieu, and return to my letter to Mi&s;s Marchmont:&mdash;<HI>now,</HI> what a joyful letter!&mdash;How peculiarly happy am I to be able to convey plea&s;ure to three &s;uch per&s;ons, as your lord&s;hip, lady Me|thuen,

<P>O MY dear lady Methuen, my heart is &s;trangely agitated! They tell me that my Henry lives! Is it&mdash;can it be po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>There is here&mdash;I mean in this neigh|bourhood &mdash;a gentleman, who profe&s;&s;es to entertain for me a pa&s;&s;ion, I as little de&s;ire as de&s;erve. I always di&s;liked &s;econd mar|riages; I thought they betrayed a want of delicacy;&mdash;but ever &s;ince I have been a widow, I have abhorred them; I have al|mo&s;t thought them criminal. I blu&s;h that any man &s;hould love me: I do not, &s;ome|how, think my&s;elf at liberty&mdash;I am &s;ure, at lea&s;t, my heart is not free&mdash;to receive addre&s;&s;es of this nature; they even &s;trike me with a kind of horror. I pity Du Mornai; and yet incon&s;i&s;tently hate him: unju&s;t and ungenerous that I am, to hate a
<PB N="209" REF="211">man only becau&s;e I have done him an in|jury! &mdash;I, however, allowed my brother to impart to him the circum&s;tances that at|tended the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band. O, my friend, I blot the la&s;t &s;entence with my tears. No woman ever loved a hu&s;band more tenderly, more ardently, nor more <HI>delicately,</HI> than I did; and yet my unju&s;t, my cruel&mdash;but &s;till dear, ever-to-be-la|mented Henry, could think me fal&s;e! Alas!&mdash;my bur&s;ting heart!&mdash;he <HI>dying</HI> thought me &s;o! Ye powers! that I &s;hould live to have my virtue &s;u&s;pected! and that too, by the man whom, next to Heaven, I e&s;teemed and loved!</P>
<P>I am writing in the mo&s;t incoherent manner&mdash;I meant to have told you, that my brother has been to vi&s;it Mon&s;ieur du Mornai; the morning after he returned, he told me&mdash;after many pau&s;es, hints, and much circumlocution&mdash;that the chevalier was of opinion, that Mr. Wentworth is &s;till alive; and had only made u&s;e of an arti|fice &mdash;which might, he &s;aid, be ea&s;ily ma|naged &mdash;to induce us to believe him dead. To my infinite &s;urpri&s;e, my brother him|&s;elf,
<PB N="210" REF="212">and all my friends here, agree in thinking this conjecture founded on pro|bability. They &s;ay a great deal in &s;upport of this opinion;&mdash;they particularly urge the congruity of &s;uch a procedure in Mr. Wentworth, with his abrupt departure from England, and earne&s;t reque&s;t to my father and brother never to make any en|quiry after him.&mdash;What, Loui&s;a, do you think of all this? For my part, I know not what to believe. I am perplexed and anxious beyond mea&s;ure. I am a thou&s;and times more mi&s;erable than ever.&mdash;Can Sir Edward, do you imagine, have heard any thing concerning Mr. Wentworth, which he fears to impart to me immediately?

<P><PB N="211" REF="213">
&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, Loui&s;a, Edward certainly knows &s;omething which he chu&s;es not to commu|nicate: I have told him that he does;&mdash; he did not deny it; but &s;queezing my hand, &s;aid, <Q>If I conceal any thing from my dear Harriet, I tru&s;t &s;he is no &s;tranger to the motive of that concealment.</Q> I &s;hould have importuned him, had not the entrance of lady Alicia Sedley put an end to our conver&s;ation. I like not to talk on this &s;ubject before her or lady Enmore; though I find my brother has made them acquainted with all my affairs; Was it right, my dear lady Methuen, to make them my confidants without my leave? This behaviour is not con&s;onant to his u&s;ual delicacy;&mdash;it mu&s;t mean &s;omething.</P>
<P>Write to me immediately, my friend: tell me, do you think it po&s;&s;ible that my Henry lives?&mdash;Why will not they tell me all they know? There is no bearing this torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>

Lady Enmore is obliged to go to Dublin for a few days;&mdash;the wedding is deferred till her return; a compliment, to which her generous friend&s;hip for Mi&s;s O'Bryen certainly entitles her: yet I fancy Sir Ed|ward paid it with reluctance.</P>
<P>I am interrupted by Mrs. Chetwynd. I am not allowed to be a moment alone. However, Mrs. Chetwynd can never be an intruder to me: I love her from my &s;oul; and could with plea&s;ure join Edward and Valeria when they call her mother, as they both frequently do.</P>

<P>When I aro&s;e ye&s;terday morning, I &s;ent, as u&s;ual, to enquire how Mrs. Wentworth had pa&s;&s;ed the night.

<P>I went to her chamber immediately. I met Sir Edward at the door. <Q>I have been with poor Harriet,</Q> &s;aid he.&mdash;In|deed, he had no need to tell me &s;o; I &s;aw by his tearful eyes where he had been.&mdash; "What &s;hall I do?" added he: <Q>my heart bleeds for her.</Q></P>
<P>"Have you told her nothing more," a&s;ked I, "than &s;he knew before?"</P>

<Q>I have not. I was &s;everal times going to &s;peak; but had not the courage. O, Valeria, &s;hould I tell her all, perhaps&mdash;</Q> he &s;topt;&mdash;it was, as a feeling writer &s;ays, "a perhaps not to be borne."</P>
<P>"In my opinion, Sir Edward," &s;aid I, <Q>no hazard can be greater, than that of &s;uffering her to remain much longer in her pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind.

<P>"I know he did live: but, oh:" cried &s;he, weeping afre&s;h, <Q>how do I know that he lives &s;till? In what part of the world am I to &s;eek him?</Q></P>

<P><Q>Forgive me; I knew not what I &s;aid; &mdash;I did not intend to wrong either his friend&s;hip or yours. But what did you &s;ay, Valeria? If matters were, as I &s;up|po&s;e &mdash;What meant my friend?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am afraid to tell you. You can bear nothing with equanimity but de|&s;pair.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For God's &s;ake! if you know any thing of my hu&s;band, do not hide it from me! O, my friend&mdash;my &s;i&s;ter!</Q> throwing her arms round my neck&mdash;<Q>if you know any thing of my Henry, do not hide it from me!</Q></P>
<P><Q>What would you that I &s;hould tell you?</Q></P>
<P>"Is he living? Where is he?"</P>
<P><Q>Mark me then, Harriet&mdash;he undoubt|edly is living; and in perfect health.</Q>&mdash; She &s;unk down on her knees, and &s;ilently rai&s;ed her hands and eyes to Heaven, with a look of tran&s;port and gratitude unutter|able. I did not attempt to move her from a po&s;ition that &s;o well became her &s;itua|tion;
<PB N="218" REF="220">but ha&s;tily mixing &s;ome &s;al-volatile with water, I gave her a gla&s;s of it: &s;he drank it almo&s;t mechanically: and think|ing &s;he would chu&s;e to be alone, I left the room.</P>
<P>Knowing how unea&s;y Sir Edward would be till he &s;aw me, I flew to the breakfa&s;t-parlour; &mdash;he met me at the door, with open arms, and looks of anxious enquiry. I recounted my proceedings; and had the plea&s;ure to receive his approbation.</P>
<P>My aunt ob&s;erving that &s;he &s;hould not be left long alone, I was returning to her apartment, when I met her in the hall. She affectionately embraced and thanked me. <Q>But, Valeria, you only half an|&s;wered my que&s;tion&mdash;Where is he?</Q></P>
<P>"I cannot tell you."</P>
<P>"Good God!" &s;he exclaimed, with the mo&s;t di&s;appointed air; <Q>you cannot tell! &mdash;How then do you know if he is living?</Q></P>
<P><Q>You mi&s;under&s;tand me; I did not mean that I could not, but&mdash;excu&s;e me &mdash;that I would not as yet inform you. Let me &s;ee you ea&s;y and chearful till
<PB N="219" REF="221">after dinner, and upon my honour I will then tell you in what prince's dominions he is.</Q></P>
<P>"Were I treated thus," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>by any per&s;on of who&s;e good-nature I could entertain the lea&s;t doubt, I &s;hould una|voidably accu&s;e them of playing with my mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You would be mo&s;t unju&s;t if you thought &s;o of me. Be a&s;&s;ured, my Har|riet, if I did not fear to overpower you with joy, I &s;hould with rapture gratify you.</Q></P>
<P>"Your motive is kind, indeed," re|turned &s;he; <Q>but the conduct re&s;ulting from it is mo&s;t cruel.</Q></P>
<P>My uncle hearing us in the hall, came out, and took us both into the parlour.</P>
<P>The dear &s;ufferer made vi&s;ible efforts to appear chearful till the expiration of the &s;tated time.&mdash;As &s;oon as the &s;ervants were withdrawn after dinner, &s;he turned to me, as I &s;at by her;&mdash;<Q>Now, Valeria, have I not been patient? Do I not de&s;erve to be pitied?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222">
Sir Edward left his &s;eat, and leaned on the back of her chair;&mdash;his intelligent countenance &s;peaking what he felt for her.</P>
<P>Her expre&s;&s;ion filled my eyes with tears: &mdash;"Indeed, Harriet," &s;aid I, <Q>you do.&mdash; A&s;k your que&s;tion.</Q></P>
<P>"Where is he?" demanded &s;he ea|gerly.</P>
<P><Q>He is in the dominions of the King of&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>"Dare I gue&s;s England?"</P>
<P>"You are right."</P>
<P>"O merciful Heaven!" cried &s;he, cla&s;p|ing her hands together; <Q>is he then in England? This is expected happine&s;s indeed! Well might you fear to over|power me with joy! O Valeria!</Q> falling on my bo&s;om&mdash;<Q>are you &s;ure my Henry is in England?</Q></P>
<P>The &s;weet, extravagant creature pro|po&s;ed &s;etting out for Dublin in&s;tantly; that &s;he might be ready to embrace the fir&s;t op|portunity of returning to England.</P>
<P>"Sure" &s;aid my uncle, <Q>you would not go till you have &s;een the chevalier du Mornai;&mdash;'twas entirely by his means
<PB N="221" REF="223">you have recovered Mr. Wentworth;&mdash; your thanks are certainly due to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, Sir, I'll write them. I would not &s;ee him on any account.</Q></P>
<P>"Pardon me, madam," he replied, <Q>I believe you ought.</Q></P>
<P>She did not contend with him; but ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to my aunt: <Q>Favour me with your advice, my dear Mrs. Chet|wynd: I will follow it implicitly. Think you not there would be an indelicacy in my receiving a vi&s;it from him? Should I not be wanting in what I owe Mr. Wentworth?</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aw my aunt was perplexed for an an|&s;wer; and particularly as &s;he could not but approve her refu&s;ing to &s;ee her ima|ginary lover:&mdash;to <HI>di&s;embarra&s;s</HI> her, I &s;aid, that I thought Mrs. Wentworth judged perfectly right with regard to Mon&s;ieur: "But indeed, Harriet," added I, <Q>I can|not &s;o readily approve of your going to England. It is certainly Mr. Went|worth's bu&s;ine&s;s to come to you. And he will do &s;o, the moment he obtains your permi&s;&s;ion; for lord Methuen has
<PB N="222" REF="224">explained to him every thing he unhap|pily mi&s;under&s;tood.</Q></P>
<P>"And is he then convinced&mdash;" <HI>of my innocence,</HI> &s;he would have &s;aid, but de|licacy and tears joined to break the &s;en|tence.</P>
<P>"My excellent Valeria!" whi&s;pered Sir Edward tenderly; and he had the a&s;&s;urance to ki&s;s my cheek. But why do I tell <HI>you</HI> this? I forget I am not writing to my aunt Chetwynd.</P>
<P>"Your brother," re&s;umed I, <Q>will write to him immediately. Not a word, my dear Harriet;</Q> for &s;he was opening her lips to &s;peak&mdash;<Q>you mu&s;t not write a line to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I mu&s;t, I mu&s;t: wherefore &s;hould I wear the appearance of a re&s;entment I do not feel? You &s;peak from the feelings of a &s;ingle woman;&mdash;I would act from tho&s;e of a wife.</Q></P>
<P>"I do not want you," &s;aid I, <Q>to re|&s;ent an error that brought its own pu|ni&s;hment with it: yet, for rea&s;ons you will your&s;elf approve, when you come to con&s;ider the matter di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately.&mdash;I
<PB N="223" REF="225">intreat you, leave it to Sir Edward to write.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And I, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, reque&s;t that you will allow your&s;elf to be directed, in this affair, by Mi&s;s O'Bryen's coun|&s;el. &mdash;I will tell my brother that you wi&s;hed to write.</Q> He put his arms round her:&mdash;tears trembled in his fine eyes: &mdash;<Q>I know, my gentle &s;i&s;ter, our con|duct has a &s;trange, and even a barbar|ous appearance to you: but I be&s;eech you to rely on our friend&s;hip:&mdash;in a &s;hort time you will be convinced of the propriety of our mea&s;ures.</Q></P>
<P>I thought it would not be ami&s;s to en|deavour to give the conver&s;ation a gayer turn:&mdash;"Go to your place, Sir Edward," &s;aid I, <Q>and take your wine. As &s;oon as the &s;ervants have dined I'll call for the coach; for be it known to you, ladies and gentlemen, we are all to drink tea with lady Melmont this evening.</Q></P>
<P>"With all my heart," cried my uncle.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall go and write my letter then," &s;aid Sir Edward.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="226">
"Very well," &s;aid I, <Q>you have no|thing el&s;e to do, for you are as well dre&s;&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible. So are you, Sir. Mrs. Wentworth and Mrs. Chetwynd, you are quite elegant. Now, do you three go and take a turn in the garden till the carriage is ready.&mdash;Lady Alicia, I don't like your cap; it does not be|come you; you mu&s;t change it.&mdash;How am I?" going to the gla&s;s"&mdash;<HI>pa&s;&s;able|ment bien;</HI> but I mu&s;t mend my hair a little.&mdash;Lady Alicia, you &s;hall dre&s;s at lord Uvedon's:&mdash;Mr. Melmont for me. If the fine Mi&s;s Stanley be there &s;till&mdash;Sir Edward &s;hall have his choice of her, or lady Anne Melmont.</Q></P>
<P>"Were there ever &s;uch airs?" &s;aid my aunt, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"Upon my word, madam," cried lady Alicia, <Q>I think &s;he takes a great deal too much upon her.</Q></P>
<P>"I think &s;o too," &s;aid Mr. Chetwynd; <Q>but as it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed her commands are very rea&s;onable, we had better &s;ub|mit. <HI>Allons me&s;dames,</HI></Q> pre&s;enting one hand to Mrs. Wentworth and the other to
<PB N="225" REF="227">my aunt, <Q>We were ordered to walk in the garden.</Q> They obeyed with a very good grace; and we three ran up &s;tairs to our &s;everal employments.</P>
<P>On our way to Firdale, Mrs. Went|worth pre&s;&s;ed to know the occa&s;ion of her hu&s;band's return to England&mdash;how he came to an eclairci&s;&s;ement with lord Methuen, &amp;c.&mdash;As I could not refu&s;e to &s;atisfy a cu|rio&s;ity &s;o very natural and rea&s;onable, I was obliged to acknowledge how far I had deceived her; and fairly di&s;covered to her the whole truth; only concealing his being at O'Bryen-ca&s;tle, as I imagined it would too much di&s;compo&s;e her to know he was &s;o near her, &s;o as I had already been com|pelled to tell her &s;o many lies, I ea&s;ily &s;tretched my con&s;cience a little further, and &s;aid he was at Cork.</P>
<P>Her boundle&s;s joy was expre&s;&s;ed more by tears than words.</P>
<P>She leaned upon my &s;houlder for near a quarter of an hour without &s;peaking: then &s;uddenly rai&s;ing her head, &s;he cried, <Q>Dear Valeria, may I depend on what you tell me now?</Q> I could not forbear to &s;mile
<PB N="226" REF="228">at her well-grounded doubts of my vera|city; and maliciou&s;ly drew in my aunt and lady Alicia to confirm my fal&s;ehood, by appealing to them for the truth of what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>"How &s;oon," a&s;ked Mrs. Wentworth, her eyes fla&s;hing fire&mdash;<Q>how &s;oon may I expect to &s;ee him?</Q></P>
<P>"Courage, my fair friend," replied Mrs. Chetwynd; <Q>he will certainly be with you to-morrow evening.</Q></P>
<P>A lively red over&s;pread her lovely face, but in&s;tantly gave way to a death-like pale|ne&s;s: &mdash;we let down the coach windows for air; which, with the application of lady Alicia's <HI>eau de luce,</HI> prevented her fainting, and, happily, &s;he was quite recovered by the time we reached Firdale.</P>
<P>Our gentlemen, who rode, arrived &s;ome time before us: a very fortunate circum|&s;tance; for almo&s;t the fir&s;t per&s;ons they &s;aw, as they entered the drawing-room, were our quondam Chevalier and Sir Francis O'Bryen. The former took an opportu|nity of whi&s;pering to his brother, an earn|e&s;t enquiry for his Harriet. Sir Francis,
<PB N="227" REF="229">gue&s;&s;ing their &s;ubject, joined them: <Q>Well, Sir Edward,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>when &s;hall I &s;ee my friend happy.</Q></P>
<P>He an&s;wered, "Very &s;oon."</P>
<P>"Soon let it be," returned he, <Q>un|le&s;s you would chu&s;e to have him be|come a mere &s;tatue: he is little different from one at pre&s;ent, except the not be|ing quite &s;o pa&s;&s;ive. The poor fellow is con&s;cious he is but bad company, for you cannot conceive any thing more dif|ficult than to get him to &s;tir from home.</Q></P>
<P>"How, my dear O'Bryen," cried Mr. Wentworth, <Q>will not you pre&s;erve &s;ome con&s;i&s;tency in your cen&s;ures? you up|braid me now with total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of my faculties&mdash;yet how often do you talk to me of the unrea&s;onable efferve&s;cence of my pa&s;&s;ions?</Q></P>
<P>"Why," replied Sir Francis, <Q>you are &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ionate to madne&s;s; but more generally quite exanimate. In &s;hort, though it &s;ounds a little har&s;hly, I am &s;ure, if your affairs continue much longer in the &s;ame train, you mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="228" REF="230">become either a madman or a fool.</Q></P>
<P>"A terrible alternative!" &s;aid Sir Ed|ward.</P>
<P>Lord Uvedon &s;eeing our carriage at a di&s;tance, came up to Mr. Wentworth, &s;aying, <Q>I fancy, Sir, you would do well to retire, until Mrs. Wentworth can be prepared to &s;ee you.</Q> This coun&s;el be|ing &s;trongly enforced by every per&s;on pre|&s;ent, he ca&s;t a wi&s;hful look towards the carriage, and heaving a deep &s;igh, &s;uffered lord Uvedon to conduct him to another room.</P>
<P>Some explanation is nece&s;&s;ary here; as your lord&s;hip will be &s;urpri&s;ed at the Mel|mont family's appearing to be &s;o well ac|quainted with the &s;ituation of our friends. &mdash;As Mr. Wentworth's happy reconcilia|tion with his lady obliged him to drop the name of Du Mornai, and re-a&s;&s;ume his own: to avoid an unplea&s;ingly my&s;terious appearance, it was requi&s;ite that &s;ome rea|&s;ons &s;hould be given for the change to Sir Francis's acquaintance, who fir&s;t knew him in his French character. All his Engli&s;h
<PB N="229" REF="231">friends thinking him dead, to them a &s;till clearer explanation was nece&s;&s;ary. Ac|cordingly, he has fabricated a tale that he de&s;igns &s;hould &s;atisfy both:&mdash;his delicacy for his Harriet not allowing him to let the world know he <HI>had</HI> &s;u&s;pected her.&mdash;Your &s;uppo&s;ed coffee-hou&s;e di&s;pute, your con&s;e|quent duel, his &s;ub&s;equent flight to Cadiz, and believing you killed&mdash;all &s;tands as it was.&mdash;As nobody knew his addre&s;s, all the letters written to him mi&s;carried: &s;o that he &s;till remained in his error; and being &s;truck with a remor&s;e &s;o violent, as in &s;ome degree to di&s;order his rea&s;on, for having murdered, upon a frivolous quarrel, a man of worth and honour, and his brother's friend, he determined to exclude him&s;elf for ever from the &s;ociety of his wife, his friends&mdash;in &s;hort, to re&s;ign every thing he held valuable. Knowing how aver&s;e his relations would be to this re&s;olution, he concealed him&s;elf from them, until his dy|ing &s;ervant's wi&s;h to mix with his native du&s;t, &s;ugge&s;ted to him a method of freeing him&s;elf from their oppo&s;ition.&mdash;The le|nient hand of Time healing, in a good
<PB N="230" REF="232">mea&s;ure, both his head and heart, he be|gan to repent of the part he had acted; and hearing, by accident from Sir Francis O'Bryen, that lord Methuen was &s;till alive, he &s;uddenly re&s;olved to return to his coun|try. &mdash;I don't know if your lord&s;hip will think this &s;tory probable; but I believe you will agree with me in thinking, that the truth of it will not be que&s;tioned. Every body of &s;en&s;e and experience, knows that things frequently happen in real life, which a judicious author would not introduce into a fictitious &s;tory. It is a very ju&s;t, though trite ob&s;ervation, that&mdash;probability is not always on the &s;ide of truth.</P>
<P>When the two gentlemen left the room, lady Melmont &s;aid it would be proper for &s;ome of the ladies to drink tea with them; which lady Lucy Domville and Mi&s;s Stan|ley did. On our enquiring for them, lady Anne &s;aid that her &s;i&s;ter was with Mi&s;s Stanley, who was confined to her chamber by a cold. Lady Melmont told my aunt, in a low voice, how matters really &s;tood. Sir Edward gave me the like information: at the &s;ame time, telling me that he thought
<PB N="231" REF="233">it would be highly imprudent to venture to let her know he was in the hou&s;e. I thought &s;o at fir&s;t my&s;elf; but when I con&s;idered the unea&s;y and un&s;ettled &s;tate of mind in which &s;he mu&s;t remain while this important affair depended, I could not help thinking it would be mo&s;t advi&s;able to put a &s;peedy period to her anxieties. Knowing how dif|ficult it would be to bring him over to <HI>my</HI> opinion, I pretended to a&s;&s;ent to <HI>his;</HI> but &s;ecretly re&s;olved to be guided by my own. His love for his &s;i&s;ter makes him act in direct oppo&s;ition to the native fire of his character; rendering him as timid, as de|liberate, as nature made him bold and de|ci&s;ive.</P>
<P>After tea, lady Anne &s;aying &s;he would go to Mi&s;s Stanley, and &s;end lady Lucy to us, I begged leave to attend her; my aunt joined in the &s;ame reque&s;t, from a de|&s;ire to &s;ee Mr. Wentworth, for whom &s;he has a great friend&s;hip. We found him lean|ing on a &s;ofa, in a po&s;ture of deep thought|fulne&s;s. He &s;aluted Mrs. Chetwynd very cordially; and bowing low to me, &s;aid,
<PB N="232" REF="234">with great gallantry, <Q>Such beauty can belong only to Mi&s;s O'Bryen.</Q></P>
<P>When we were &s;eated, he &s;aid, directing him&s;elf to my aunt, <Q>O, madam, will the dear trea&s;ure I threw away in my folly never be re&s;tored to me again?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It &s;hall be re&s;tored to you imme|diately,</Q> replied I, with &s;ome &s;pirit.</P>
<P>"What do you mean, my dear?" a&s;ked my aunt.</P>
<P><Q>I mean to elude Sir Edward's caution; and this very evening to re-unite this de|&s;erving pair.</Q></P>
<P>He aro&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ing one of my hands between both his, &s;aid, <Q>Then, madam, I &s;hall &s;ay that my Harriet was fir&s;t given me by Hymen, and the &s;econd time by an angel!</Q></P>
<P>I returned to the drawing-room with lady Lucy.&mdash;We found lady Melmont, lady Alicia, my uncle, and Mr. Domville, ju&s;t &s;itting down to quadrille. The re&s;t of the company was going to make another table; but Sir Francis prote&s;ting it was a &s;in to wa&s;te &s;uch a fine evening at cards, lord
<PB N="233" REF="235">Melmont propo&s;ed a walk, to which we all agreed.</P>
<P>As we walked, I &s;ecretly begged Sir Francis would draw off Sir Edward; tell|ing him my motive for the reque&s;t: he warmly approved my de&s;ign; and promi&s;ed to take away all the gentlemen if he could.</P>
<P>"Sir Edward," &s;aid he, <Q>have you &s;een my lord's canal improvements?</Q> Being an&s;wered in the negative, he pro|po&s;ed going to view them. Your friend &s;aid, he had no objection, if it were agree|able to the ladies. Mrs. Wentworth would have complied, but lady Lucy and I had our own rea&s;ons for oppo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>"Let <HI>us</HI> go, however," &s;aid O'Bryen.</P>
<P>"No, no," replied Sir Edward, <Q>we'll take another opportunity.&mdash;Sir Francis,</Q> added he, with a &s;mile, <Q>I &s;hould not have &s;u&s;pected <HI>you</HI> for &s;uch a propo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>Lord Melmont did not give up the point &s;o ea&s;ily; being extremely fond, as O'Bryen well knew, of having his improvements admired, he &s;econded the motion &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly,
<PB N="234" REF="236">that Sir Edward could not civilly withhold his con&s;ent any longer.</P>
<P>Sir Francis perceiving that Mr. Mel|mont meant to attach him&s;elf to our party, took hold of his arm, &s;aying, <Q>Come along, Melmont. Deuce take me if you, or any man living, &s;hall quietly en|joy a ble&s;&s;ing I chu&s;e to re&s;ign.&mdash;<HI>Servi|teur, me&s;dames;</HI> we &s;hall return in a mo|ment,</Q> ki&s;&s;ing his hand to us, with his u&s;ual air of graceful &s;prightline&s;s.</P>
<P>"Saucy fellows!" &s;aid lady Lucy, when they left us; <Q>we'll take care they &s;hall not. Come, my friends, &s;hall we go in?</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ented; &s;aying, <Q>Since we are for|&s;aken by one &s;et of beaux, we mu&s;t only have recour&s;e to another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They are too bu&s;y with their cards to mind you,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Wentworth.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that I did not mean the gen|tlemen of the card party.</P>
<P>"Who then?" &s;he demanded carele&s;s|ly: <Q>I pre&s;ume lord Uvedon is not at home.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="237">
<Q>He is; and I wi&s;h to Heaven I dare bring you to the place he is in.</Q></P>
<P>"What is your rea&s;on for &s;uch a wi&s;h?" a&s;ked &s;he, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>Cannot you gue&s;s? Does Sir Francis's being here &s;ugge&s;t nothing to you?</Q></P>
<P>"O, Valeria, is my Henry here?"</P>
<P>"He is:&mdash;be compo&s;ed."</P>
<P>She trembled violently; and there was a wildne&s;s in her looks which froze my blood. My good-natured friend, alarmed at her di&s;order, gently reproved my precipitance; and &s;upported her by holding one arm, while I held the other. I was exceedingly agitated my&s;elf; and really &s;tood in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I endeavoured to give her.</P>
<P>"O God! &s;upport me!" &s;aid &s;he, in a voice hardly articulate.</P>
<P>We placed her on a garden-chair. Nei|ther of us was able to refrain from weep|ing: &mdash;tears are &s;oftly infectious;&mdash;&s;he wept likewi&s;e; which con&s;iderably relieved her. Starting up, &s;he cried, <Q>Come, my dear Valeria, will you not conduct me to my Henry?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="238">
"I will," &s;aid I; again taking hold of her arm, and pre&s;&s;ing her hand to my brea&s;t. <Q>But, my deare&s;t Harriet, &s;um|mon all your courage:&mdash;&s;hould you &s;uf|fer by my conduct, Edward will never forgive me. Promi&s;e me that you will not faint.</Q></P>
<P>She replied with an amiable &s;implicity, "Indeed I will not, if I can help it." With trembling &s;teps &s;he ha&s;ted towards the hou&s;e, leaning on lady Lucy and me.</P>
<P>I took her into a &s;mall parlour, adjoin|ing that in which Mr. Wentworth was; begging lady Lucy would direct him to us. He came in&s;tantly, accompanied by my aunt only. He flew to her; his arms in|voluntarily extended to embrace her; but, as if impelled by a &s;udden recollection of his injurious conduct, he threw him&s;elf on his knees at her feet; pa&s;&s;ionately ki&s;&s;ing her hand, and the tears falling fa&s;t down his face, he cried, "O, Harriet! forgive me!" She &s;unk from my arms, almo&s;t lifele&s;s, into his, faintly murmuring, "My Henry!"</P>
<P>They remained &s;everal minutes in a clo&s;e embrace, without &s;peech or motion.&mdash;O,
<PB N="237" REF="239">my lord, what mu&s;t have been their feel|ings!</P>
<P>At length, he gently rai&s;ing her, &s;aid, <Q>My dear, my injured wife! &s;ay that you forgive&mdash;&s;ay that you love me!</Q> She was not able to reply:&mdash;I thought I &s;aw her ju&s;t expiring; and kneeling by her, I exclaimed in the mo&s;t frantic manner, <Q>O, Harriet! &s;peak! live!&mdash;Edward, dear Edward! forgive me!</Q> My beloved aunt, inexpre&s;&s;ibly terrified at my beha|viour, rai&s;ed me from the ground; and weeping, folded me to her fond heart:&mdash; "My child&mdash;my darling child!" &s;aid the tendere&s;t of parents, <Q>be not alarmed;&mdash; &s;he will recover pre&s;ently.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wentworth, with a di&s;tracted air, cried, <Q>Revive, my only love! Let me not lo&s;e my dearer life in you!&mdash;Oh! thou injured angel! what a barbarian have I been to thee!</Q></P>
<P>Had &s;he continued much longer in&s;en|&s;ible, I don't know what might have been the con&s;equence.&mdash;Opening her lovely eyes, &s;he gazed on her hu&s;band with a tenderne&s;s not to be de&s;cribed.&mdash;<Q>My &s;oul! my

<P>Enraptured to hear again the &s;ound of that &s;oft voice, I &s;prung from my aunt, and again threw my&s;elf by her on the floor. "My lovely &s;i&s;ter!" &s;aid the &s;weet crea|ture. &mdash;Mr. Wentworth, in the &s;ame affec|tionate tone, kindly repeated, <Q>And <HI>my</HI> lovely &s;i&s;ter!</Q> putting one arm round my wai&s;t, he lifted us both; &s;aying to me, with an air of politene&s;s and &s;incerity, <Q>Mi&s;s O'Bryen, I have obligations to you that words cannot repay.</Q></P>
<P>My aunt ob&s;erving that Mrs. Went|worth's &s;pirits were weak and exhau&s;ted, called for Sir Francis's chai&s;e; and &s;tept up to lady Melmont, reque&s;ting &s;he would let them go unnoticed; to which her lady|&s;hip con&s;ented, on the obliging condition, that the re&s;t of the family &s;hould &s;tay to &s;up with her.</P>
<P>My aunt, Mrs. Wentworth, and her happy Henry, were ju&s;t departed, when the gentlemen returned. O'Bryen danced
<PB N="239" REF="241">up to me:&mdash;<Q>What have you done &s;ince, my fair cou&s;in?</Q></P>
<P>"Sent them home together."</P>
<P>"Are you &s;erious?" his eyes &s;parkling with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><Q>Serious, upon my honour. And you mu&s;t &s;leep at Chetwynd-villa, for they have taken your carriage:&mdash;you &s;hall have your choice of the two vacant &s;eats in our coach.</Q></P>
<P>"Do what you plea&s;e with me," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Lord Uvedon overhearing him, &s;aid, with a pretty affected &s;igh, <Q>Alas! O'Bryen, how many of our &s;ex are there, with whom that lady does what &s;he plea&s;es!</Q></P>
<P>"Faith," replied my gay relation, <Q>&s;he does what &s;he plea&s;es with both &s;exes; as Sir Edward Marchmont may know to his co&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Edward bowing to me, with his ac|cu&s;tomed grace, &s;aid, <Q>Mi&s;s O'Bryen's power over my &s;ex, no man can be more &s;en&s;ible of than my&s;elf; but I confe&s;s I do not perceive how any influence &s;he
<PB N="240" REF="242">may have over the ladies can affect me.</Q></P>
<P>"It affects you very nearly," an&s;wered Sir Francis, <Q>for &s;he has di&s;po&s;ed of your &s;i&s;ter without your knowledge; and <HI>mon petit chevalier</HI> is gone off with her.</Q></P>
<P>Your dear friend's &s;u&s;ceptible heart was too much overjoyed to be re&s;trained by the laws of cold propriety, from di&s;cover|ing its emotions;&mdash;the pre&s;ence of &s;o large a company did not prevent his expre&s;&s;ing the acknowledgments, he generou&s;ly ima|gined, due to me, in terms but too flatter|ingly particular.</P>
<P>What an uncon&s;cionable letter have I written! Was I not in the right, to prepare you for a long one? I a&s;&s;ure you it has furni&s;hed me with con&s;tant employment for two days&mdash;or nights, rather. I have not the confidence to expect you can read it <HI>tout de &s;uite;</HI> but as Sir Edward tells me he has amply experienced your patience, I am not without hopes, that you will be able to get through it in &s;ome little time.</P>

<P>I AM infinitely &s;orry it is not in my power to return to Chetwynd-villa to-day; &mdash;when I came home la&s;t night, I found a letter from my mother, wherein &s;he com|plains very much of her health: I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with vi&s;iting her immediately; and am ju&s;t on the wing for Dublin.</P>
<P>The little box that accompanies this, I did not get out of the jeweller's hands till late la&s;t night; though the things have been be&s;poken the&s;e two months. I thought the ra&s;cal would never let me have them. I &s;hall be much indebted to you, if you will take the trouble to order Mi&s;s O'Bryen's woman to leave them on her lady's toil|lette.</P>
<P>I know what my dear, &s;agacious uncle, will think of my journey to town; but it is
<PB N="244" REF="246">no &s;uch matter, I a&s;&s;ure you. I own there have lately been overtures made to me from that quarter, through lady O'Bryen: &s;he approves them; but I do not. I hate the&s;e &s;ober, formal, patched-up family-matches. To think of my going expre&s;sly to pay my addre&s;&s;es to a woman I never &s;aw!&mdash;and who&s;e temper and character&mdash; who&s;e very face&mdash;I know only on report from the opinion of others! ridiculous! dete&s;table! No, I will judge for my&s;elf, chu&s;e for my&s;elf; and if ever I marry a woman that does not wait till I a&s;k her,&mdash; may I be a cuckold in the honey-moon! &mdash;I am a&s;toni&s;hed that gentlemen have not more pride&mdash;more delicacy&mdash;for their fe|male relations. Had I a &s;i&s;ter or a daugh|ter, &s;he might die an old maid &s;ooner than I would <HI>offer</HI> her to any man. I could not endure to have a &s;aucy coxcomb exult&mdash; even in thought&mdash;at having rejected her.</P>
<P>One word <HI>a l'oreille:</HI>&mdash;lady Anne Mel|mont&mdash;amiable, elegant, accompli&s;hed, &s;en|&s;ible, and unaffected; of a noble and wor|thy family, with a re&s;pectable fortune.&mdash; It will do, aunt; but&mdash;mum!</P>

<P>I hope I &s;hall be able to prevail on my mother to return with me to O'Bryen-ca&s;tle. The country air agrees be&s;t with her; be|&s;ides, &s;he mu&s;t come and pay her re&s;pects to lady Marchmont.</P>

<P>I AM extremely glad you found lady O'Bryen &s;o much better than you expect|ed; though, I confe&s;s, I am not a little angry with her, for contriving to be indi&s;|po&s;ed &s;o very <HI>mal a propos.</HI> You have mi&s;&s;ed a wedding, my friend:&mdash;ye&s;terday Mr. Chetwynd joined the hands of the love|lie&s;t pair I ever beheld.&mdash;We had no com|pany but the ladies of the Melmont family. Lady Alicia Sedley, and lady Anne Mel|mont, were bridemaids. Your admired lady Anne looked more than u&s;ually pretty. I regretted that you were not pre&s;ent: what an opportunity to &s;ay &s;oft things!&mdash;I took care, however, that &s;he &s;hould think of you.&mdash;"Dear lady Anne," whi&s;pered I,
<PB N="247" REF="249"><Q>what would Sir Francis O'Bryen give to be here now!</Q> She was &s;ilent, blu&s;hed, looked down, and opened and &s;hut her fan with the &s;weete&s;t confu&s;ion imaginable. How ea&s;y to read the language of an ingenuous heart!</P>
<P>'Twould be vain for me to attempt to mention the bride: your own lively imagi|nation will &s;carcely be able to do her ju&s;|tice;&mdash;judge then if my pen can.</P>
<Q><L>"Triumphant beauty never looks &s;o gay</L>
<L>"As on the morning of a nuptial day."</L></Q>
<P>This ob&s;ervation is rather quaintly ex|pre&s;&s;ed; but I think you would with me have &s;ub&s;cribed to its ju&s;tne&s;s, had you &s;een your charming cou&s;in ye&s;terday morning; her fine complexion heightened by plea&s;ure, and mode&s;ty again improving the rouge of joy.</P>
<P>I wonder not at the ardour of my bro|ther's pa&s;&s;ion for her. I acknowledge that I never &s;aw a woman, who in per&s;on, mind, and manners, would appear &s;o completely
<PB N="248" REF="250">and engagingly beautiful to an unprejudiced man: but my fond eye di&s;covers more at|tractions in another;&mdash;my gentle Harriet is to me a hundred times more lovely.</P>
<P>Sir Edward calls him&s;elf the happie&s;t of men: but &s;urely the cup of happine&s;s mu&s;t have a higher flavour to me, who have drunk &s;o deeply of its bitter rever&s;e. Yet perhaps his a&s;&s;ertion may be ju&s;t; for he feels not, as I do, the pang of having in|jured her he loves.&mdash;I look back on my pa&s;t conduct with amazement:&mdash;how could I &s;u&s;pect her?

<Q><L>"Pure as the winter &s;tream, when ice embo&s;&s;ed</L>
<L>"Whitens its cour&s;e."</L></Q>
<P>Even to my&s;elf re&s;erved, though fond.&mdash; Never, never can I make her &s;ufficient amends for what &s;he has &s;uffered for me. Yet the dear, too generous girl, thinks her&s;elf recompen&s;ed for years of heart|rending angui&s;h, only by the return of that affection and confidence I never had a right to withdraw.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="251">
