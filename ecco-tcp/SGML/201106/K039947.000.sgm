<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Rea&s;on of my undertaking the following Analy&s;is, will be plainly enough &s;een in the Introduc|tion; but whether I have &s;ucceeded or fail'd in my Account of the <HI>Diabetes</HI> and it's Cure, as it ari&s;es from the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Waters, is left entirely to your Determination.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
<P>It has never once enter'd into my Imagination, that tho&s;e Waters will more effectually cure a <HI>Diabetes</HI> and <HI>Hectic</HI> now than heretofore, or any great Advantage accrue to Mankind from this Account; yet it has ever been agreeable to find the Theory of any Science, corre&s;ponding to the Facts ari&s;ing from the Practice of it.</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e me, if thro' this Account of the <HI>Diabetes, &amp;c.</HI> I in|cline to my Profe&s;&s;ion. Every Man has &s;ome Bias, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s in which he is mo&s;t engag'd is naturally mo&s;t apt to draw him.</P>
<P>There was a time you perfectly well know, when almo&s;t every thing in Phy&s;ic was accounted for from Chemical Principles. There was al&s;o, when every Di&s;ea&s;e and the Cure of
<PB N="v" REF="4">it, was reduced to Mathematical and Hydro&s;tatical Accounts: And all the&s;e in their different Turns have di&s;ap|pear'd, and Ob&s;ervation and the Hi&s;tory of Di&s;ea&s;es have again &s;uc|ceeded.</P>
<P>But methinks there is a Degree of Truth annex'd to every Manner of accounting for Di&s;orders, tho' not an ab&s;olute one, and they &s;eem to be mo&s;tly fal&s;e, only when they deny a Truth to each other. Anatomy will di&s;cover to us, that the Arteries and Veins contain what we call Blood, but what that Fluid is, and what Al|terations ari&s;e in it from different De|grees of Heat, and the Addition of different Medicines, Chemi&s;try alone can inform us. It informs us al&s;o ex|perimentally, whether our Secretions, &s;ome of them, are perfectly &s;ecern'd
<PB N="vi" REF="5">or not. And tho' we cannot venture to a&s;certain, that becau&s;e &s;uch and &s;uch Phaenomena ari&s;e from the Mix|ture of different Medicines with the Animal Fluids, apart from the Body, that they will be &s;imilar there to, when within the Laws of Circulation; yet we mu&s;t not altogether di&s;pi&s;e the <HI>Experimental</HI> and <HI>Analogical</HI> Manner of rea&s;oning; &s;ince we very often &s;ee that very fatal Con&s;equences are brought on by Medicine, and very probably too in the &s;ame Manner within us, as without, in the Experiments. It would be as ridiculous, ju&s;t, as if we &s;hould contemn the Advantages ac|cruing from Numbers becau&s;e we can|not attain to Infinity.</P>
<P>Whatever has been &s;aid here in the Chemical Hypothe&s;is, may be &s;aid with equal Truth in another View of
<PB N="vii" REF="6">the Mathematical and Hydro&s;tatical Account.</P>
<P>It may perhaps &s;eem at fir&s;t Sight that the Situation of the Well is too poetically de&s;cribed, for any thing in which Phy&s;ic is concern'd; but I ima|gine when it is con&s;ider'd that it was de&s;ign'd as a Picture, and as it relieves the Mind from the Dryne&s;s of the Ex|periments, &s;uch a Liberty may be al|low'd me; e&s;pecially &s;ince when the De&s;cription ends, that kind of Stile is no longer continued.</P>
<P>If this E&s;&s;ay &s;hould have the good Fortune of being liked by you, it will amply reward the Care I took in the Experimental Part; where to be ju&s;t was my &s;tricte&s;t Endeavour, as it &s;hall always be in preparing tho&s;e Medi|cines which may come under your
<PB N="viii" REF="7">Admini&s;tration: And for tho&s;e Rea|&s;ons, that every Phy&s;ician may receive the due Honour of a ju&s;t Pre&s;cription, and every Patient the true Effect of a good Medicine.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is more than a Year &s;ince I began a Cour&s;e of Experiments on the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Waters; but up|on knowing that Dr <HI>Keir</HI> had undertaken the Analy&s;is, I im|mediately &s;topt my Enquiry, and awaited his Publication, in Expectation of &s;omething quite accurate and &s;atisfactory. Upon peru&s;al of his Book I found my &s;elf di&s;ap|pointed, and continu'd my Experiments for the&s;e Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;ee no Account for the Heat and other Phaenomena of the Waters.</P>
<P>Next, I apprehend the Conclu&s;ions drawn from his Experiments are not ju&s;t.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<P>And la&s;tly, If the Waters do contain what the Doctor affirms, they will ever be irreconcilable with the Cure of a <HI>Diabetes.</HI></P>
<P>I think then, there needs no Apology for an Enquiry of this Kind. It rather becomes nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome other &s;hould be made which may bring the Rationale and Practice of tho&s;e Waters to coincide, and &s;atisfy the Patient of the Truth of &s;ome Principles, upon which he may ground his Expectation of a Cure. Now let us &s;uppo&s;e they con|tain <HI>Nitre</HI> and <HI>Lime&s;tone Powder</HI> with an exceeding &s;ubtle Spirit. Is there in this City any Phy&s;ician that would heartily pre&s;cribe the&s;e Waters: Or any di&s;tant Phy&s;ician that would &s;end a Patient to a Mineral either trifling, inefficacious, or of a Nature quite oppo&s;ite the Cure? If then this &s;hould be the Event, which is not unlikely, it will be fatal to the Health, if not Lives, of great Numbers.</P>
<P>As the following Experiments are of my own making, I can the better an&s;wer for the Truth of the Facts. There has been no Accuracy wanting in di&s;covering the Con|tents of the Waters, and a&s;certaining them from Phaenomena quite definitive. I have produced al&s;o analogous Appearances by dif|ferent Experiments, with Conjectures of their
<PB N="3" REF="10">Cau&s;es; then having con&s;ider'd the Source of a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> I &s;hew the Effects of tho&s;e Con|tents on animal Solids and Fluids as they produce the Cure.</P>
<P>Whatever Contradictions may be found in this Analy&s;is to that of Dr <HI>Keir,</HI> they mu&s;t not be under&s;tood to ari&s;e from any Inclination I have to contradict, but from the Truth of the Examination. And where that is the Suppo&s;ition every Man will be &s;atisfied with it, however contrary to his Sentiments.</P>

<PB REF="11">
<HEAD>THE SITUATION OF THE HOT-WELL.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Situation of the <HI>Hot-Well</HI> is as picture&s;que perhaps as can be imagin'd; it lies on the Side of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> about a Mile and half di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> The Stream i&s;&s;ues from a very high Clift of Lime Rock, perhaps two hundred Feet below the Summit, and ten above the Level of Low Water, but as the Water ri&s;es here in the lowe&s;t Tides thirty Feet, and in the Spring much more, it was of Nece&s;&s;ity ren|der'd inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ome hours every Day, till Mr <HI>Padmore,</HI> (a Man well known for his
<PB N="5" REF="12">Genius in Mechanics) inclos'd it with a Ci&s;tern, and affixed Pumps to the Spring, by means of the&s;e the Stream is elevated almo&s;t thirty Feet in all its native Heat, Purity, and Perfection: Notwith&s;tanding this Care the River Water, when it ri&s;es above the Spring, mixes with the Medicinal and renders it unfit for U&s;e; this is perfectly well known by tho&s;e that pump at the Well, and con&s;equently as &s;oon as perceived they ab&s;tain till it recovers its former Purity.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Avon</HI> flows here till it falls int othe <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, between two Cliffs, in &s;ome Places va&s;tly high, craggy and over|hanging, in others perpendicular or gently &s;loping; here cover'd with Woods and flowering Shrubs, of all the different Shades of Green, fill'd with Mu&s;ic of our Singing Birds; There gloomy and ob&s;cure, con|tra&s;ted by &s;trong Lights, and various Colours of the Marble Rocks, which are as variega|ted as the foreign, and admit as beautiful a Poli&s;h. Add to this the flowing of the Tide which enhan&s;es the Beauty, by bringing Ve&s;&s;els of every Kind clo&s;e to the Windows of the <HI>Water-Room,</HI> and compleats as agreeable Land&s;cape as can be &s;een any where. And as the Mind and Body reciprocally affect each other, how proper an Entertainment is it for the Imaginations of Men indi&s;|po&s;ed,
<PB N="6" REF="13">and how Salutary an Avocation to tho&s;e Thoughts which every <HI>Valetudinarian</HI> is too apt to indulge? Hence it is in &s;ome greater degree conducive to Health, than Places altogether void of the&s;e Amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>On the Summit of the Rocks there for|merly &s;tood a Chapel, dedicated to St <HI>Vin|cent,</HI> it is equally uncertain whether he was canonized for the Di&s;covery of the Medicinal Spring, and the Cures thence re&s;ulting to Mankind, or from clearing the River of huge Rocks that di&s;tre&s;s'd the Sailors in their Navigation near this Place. Whatever was the Cau&s;e, he con&s;tantly received their Vows for fafety as their tutelar Saint, and was of no &s;mall Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Downs</HI> which are on a Level with the Cliffs are of a dry healthy Soil, and much frequented by Company; they are open to the reviving Breezes of the Sea, which refre&s;h them every Summer's Day. Here too you may adapt your Pro&s;pects and Situa|tion to every Humour, whither you chu&s;e to be conceal'd beneath the Shade of Rocks and Woods, reclin'd be&s;ide &s;ome murmuring Rivulet, which naturally return our Thoughts upon our&s;elves; or whether you prefer the exalted Situation, where the Mind widens with the View into Benevolence and good
<PB N="7" REF="14">Wi&s;hes. That Pro&s;pects have a kind of Moral Effect on the Thought I pre&s;ume no one will deny, &s;ince Light and Colours are to the Eye, what Sound and Harmony is to the Ear. Hence too it was that the Temples of the ancient Deities were &s;ituated accord|ing to their Attributes: That of <HI>Pluto</HI> in a Cavern all &s;ad and gloomy, by the Side of rumbling Waters; whil&s;t that of the Mu&s;es was placed on the Point of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> all gay and enlivening; perhaps the mo&s;t elevated Eminence of this Cliff was made the Seat of St <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Chapel, becau&s;e his Beneficence was more exten&s;ive than that of other Men.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ential Difference of the Air in this Place, from mo&s;t other dry and elevated Situations is, that it has but little, if any, of that <HI>vague Acid,</HI> &s;o generally di&s;per&s;ed thro' the Earth, which in &s;ome Places is even deadly, as at the Grotto <HI>Dei Cani</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> We may be a&s;&s;ured of this from the Nature of the Waters and Fo&s;&s;ils in both, which, an Alcale&s;cence prevails. Now every thing offen&s;ive in the Atmo&s;phere mu&s;t ari&s;e from Exhalation, but it is &s;carce probable that there are any acid Effluvia here, becau&s;e if the acid was in any Quantity there mu&s;t be more Salts found in the Water, &s;ince it is evident there is no want of Lime&s;tone: Now Lime&s;tone and a mineral Acid for ever pro|duce
<PB N="8" REF="15">Alum, and con&s;equently as there is little Alum found here, the Air mu&s;t be void of acid Effluvia: Notwith&s;tanding this this great Advantage, it mu&s;t not be thought that this Air is agreeable to every Indi&s;p&s;i|tion, it can be of Service to none but tho&s;e of a cold pituitous nervous Habit, and detri|mental to all who&s;e Juices tend to Alcale&s;cence and Putrefaction from a &s;anguine Con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>The Lodging-Hou&s;es are neat and well &s;ituated, having a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect, and as they are near a large City 'tis ea&s;y to be pro|vided with every Nece&s;&s;ary: Here are Baths too, both private and well contriv'd, and a <HI>Long Room</HI> with the u&s;ual Diver&s;ions attend|ing &s;uch Places.</P>
<P>It &s;eems but of little Significancy to deter|mine the Quantity of Water di&s;charged in any certain Time, becau&s;e it conduces no|thing towards an Account of it's Properties, and &s;ince there is more wa&s;ted than u&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the great Demand for it. But &s;hould there be any one curious enough to enquire, he may be &s;atisfied by the follow|ing Experiment: it has been experimentally found by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mariotte,</HI> that Water flowing from the Surface of a Pool thro' a Hole an Inch &s;quare, and always full, runs
<PB N="9" REF="16">off thirty Cubic Feet in an Hour, <HI>Paris</HI> Mea&s;ure. Upon this Experiment having ta|ken the mean Proportion of the Depth of the Stream, where it runs out over the Rock, it may be nearly known how many &s;quare Inches it contains, and con&s;equently what Aperture it would pa&s;s through naturally; then con&s;idering that the Contents of Circles are to each other as the Squares of their Diameters, the whole Di&s;charge in one Hour may be pretty ju&s;tly known.</P>
<P>How long this Medicinal Water has been pre&s;cribed by Phy&s;icians, for tho&s;e Maladies it is now &s;o de&s;ervedly e&s;teem'd to cure, is uncertain. We know however, that they have been admini&s;ter'd with great Succe&s;s, and their Character much heighten'd by the pre&s;ent Phy&s;icians of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>

<P>BEFORE I begin, I fore&s;ee the mo&s;t material Objection, which is, that na|turally there is no Lime&s;tone calcin'd, and con&s;equently the Heat mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome other Cau&s;e; and as that Acid which is every where floating thro' the Earth, re|&s;embles Oil of Vitriol, it will, like that Oil meeting with Water, produce Heat; this may be granted, but then the Stream would ta&s;te acid, and turn Syrup of Violets red, and the Alum mu&s;t be in greater Proportion, &s;ince here is more alcaline Earth than the Acid can &s;ate: Which is demon&s;trated by the alcaline Qualities predominating at the Well. Neither can the Warmth ari&s;e from the Solution of the Salts, for all fo&s;&s;ile Salts
<PB N="22" REF="27">produce Cold in Di&s;&s;olution, much le&s;s can it come from the Attrition of the Water, becau&s;e that is experimentally known not to affect Water. If in the poli&s;hing two Marble Stones you rub one again&s;t the other dry, they will conceive an inten&s;e Heat, but add the lea&s;t Water and it is impo&s;&s;ible to produce it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Objections then being got over, I beg leave to take back my own Sentiments wherever I find them, and endeavour to prove, that it is probable, at &s;ome di&s;tant Time this Lime Rock was partially cal|cin'd by a &s;ubterraneous Fire, and has &s;up|plied the Stream with Warmth ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd at the &s;ame Time, that this Subject will admit of no experi|mental Proof, and whether I &s;ucceed or not in the Account of the Cau&s;e of the Heat, it has already been definitively proved to be a Lime Water, in which is di&s;&s;olved Alum and Sea-Salt; but as Natural Philo&s;o|phy is in great Part but Analogy, and as Pro|bability is equal to Demon&s;tration in all Ca&s;es where a down-right Negative with|out any Support is the Oppo&s;ition, it may be allow'd me here. To in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf in any Country in which there was not the lea&s;t Trace of any human Pre&s;ence

Add the corre&s;ponding Inequalities of the Cliffs on each Side, and that the Heat ari&s;es from Lime in the Act of &s;laking, and that naturally there is no Lime without Fire. The Inclination of the River is mo&s;t evidently thro' the Valley of <HI>Long A&s;hton,</HI> which leads to the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, and there is a faint Tradition that it once ran that Way, till

<P>That what has already been &s;aid is the true Cau&s;e of a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> will evidently ap|pear from the Hi&s;tory of that Malady, as laid down by our be&s;t Phy&s;icians, and every Symptom is ea&s;ily deduced from that Ori|ginal. Whoever will take the lea&s;t trouble to review the above Quotations, will ea&s;ily deduce every Symptom from the Cau&s;e which has been a&s;&s;ign'd before; and mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the Cure wholly depends upon bringing
<PB N="29" REF="34">back the true Secretion of Urine, which is no more than &s;eparating the animal Salts from the Fluids, and re&s;toring the Strength and Ela&s;ticity of the over-di&s;tended Fibres.</P>
<P>There remains now that we examine, if Lime in the Act of &s;laking will &s;eparate tho&s;e urinous Salts, and whether Alum will re&s;tore the Tone of the weaken'd Fibres. What the Effects of Lime will be cannot be better &s;een than by the XCVIIth Experiment of the learned <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> with his Ob&s;erva|tions of it's U&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence are plainly di&s;cover'd the Effects of Lime on animal Fluids, and that it exactly executes what a Medicine mu&s;t do to cure a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> which is to extricate, and prepare an ea&s;y Secretion for the more fixed muriatic Salts &s;ticking in the Blood. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e that this Separation of the Salts is brought about, what mu&s;t be added to fini&s;h the Cure? It mu&s;t be &s;ome Medicine which may bring the Fibres into a contractile State, and recover that Ela&s;ticy they had lo&s;t from too great Di&s;tention; that Alum will an&s;wer in all this Part is notorious; from it's A&s;trin|gency it will bring the Stomach into &s;tronger Contractions, and improve Dige&s;tion; in the Glands it will le&s;&s;en the Diameters of the &s;ecreting Ve&s;&s;els; in the Arteries it will
<PB N="30" REF="35">&s;horten their Fibres, improve their Spring, and accelerate the Circulation; and as, according to the Laws of Hydro&s;tatics, Fluids circu|lating in Tubes have their lighte&s;t Parts dri|ven to the Sides, whil&s;t the more heavy are propell'd, the emulgent Arteries lying at right Angles mu&s;t receive the lighte&s;t Parts of the Fluid, and bring it to the Kidnies, which from the aluminous Particles are con|tracted to let nothing thro' but the&s;e Salts di&s;&s;olved in the aqueous Men&s;trum, which the Lime had before di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>We can now a&s;&s;ign a good Rea&s;on for the drinking tho&s;e Waters warm at the Spring, without being obliged to a Ficton for their Virtues. Since it is demon&s;trated, that all the &s;alutary Effects ari&s;e from the <HI>&s;laking</HI> Lime, and that after that Action cea&s;es by cooling, it produces no Alteration on animal Solids and Fluids, but as a mere alcaline Earth. The aluminous Part indeed, tho' the &s;ame at a Di&s;tance as when on the Spot, avails no|thing without the previous Separation of the Salts, which can be effected by the <HI>&s;laking</HI> Lime only.</P>

Now with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Water, were it ten times as &s;trongly impreg|nated with Lime, it would create a very vi&s;ible Effect in the foregoing Experiment, but tho' it &s;hould not as it is, yet it mu&s;t not be concluded from thence that it is quite in|efficacious, we mu&s;t &s;ay notwith&s;tanding that it has every proportional Appearance with the other. Another In&s;tance will better ex|plain my Meaning. You have a Bundle of Straw under your Arm, I take one &s;ecretly from you, yet by the &s;tricte&s;t Scrutiny of your Eye and Hand you neither perceive the Weight nor Number much le&s;&s;en'd; but it is le&s;&s;en'd in both re&s;pects, or the Weight is compounded from an aggregate of no Weights, and the Number of no Numbers, which is impo&s;&s;ible. Well then, &s;hould I repeat the Theft it will at la&s;t appear very plain in both Sen&s;es, and you were hinder'd from ob|&s;erving it in the fir&s;t, by what was &s;aid of the Atmo&s;phere, the Difference was not great enough to create a di&s;tinct Perception,

<P>It has been found by &s;ome &s;ubject to Ne|phritic Complaints, that at their fir&s;t coming to the Well and drinking the Waters, the Paroxy&s;ms have oftner &s;ucceeded each other, and with more Violence than before, and thence they have concluded that the Waters increa&s;e the&s;e Di&s;orders: But how unju&s;t is this when we con&s;ider that the Pain is not the Di&s;ea&s;e, but a Con&s;equence of it's pa&s;&s;ing off by Means of Medicine, or the Efforts of Nature throwing off the already generated Concretions. Suppo&s;e any Quantity of Gravel lodg'd in the Ba&s;on of the Kidnies, is it not manife&s;t that Pains mu&s;t &s;ucceed upon it's removal from thence thro' the Ureters into the Bladder? And is it not equally certain, that whatever promotes the di&s;lodging this Gravel from the Kidnies is a &s;alutary Medicine? And the more efficacious it is, the oftner the Paroxy&s;ms will follow each other, till the whole is brought away? This is directly the Ca&s;e in the Hot Well Water, and &s;een in this true Light removes the Objection.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee whether our Theory will not vindicate this Fact. Every one allows that Nephitic Di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e from &s;ome Fault in the Urinary Secretion; it has been already experimentally ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>&s;laking Lime</HI> produces that true Secretion; hence it follows that no Alterative can be more &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
<PB N="39" REF="44">pur&s;ued than this Medicinal Water, &s;ince it wa&s;hes off the already concreted Gravel, and hinders it from being generated a-new, by producing the genuine Di&s;charge.</P>
<P>It does not belong to me to &s;ay what Medicine or Diet is be&s;t adapted in each Ca&s;e with the&s;e Waters, whatever Phy&s;ician &s;hall have the Care of tho&s;e that drink this Medicinal Water, will inform them in the&s;e and many other things, altogether beyond any thing that can be &s;aid by me.</P>
