<HEAD>THE VIRTUES AND EXCELLENCY OF THE <HI>American</HI> Tobacco Plant.</HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;covery and Con|que&s;t of <HI>America</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> enrich'd <HI>Europe</HI> with not only va&s;t Trea&s;ures of Gold and Silver, but al&s;o di&s;co|ver'd and furni&s;h'd us with (per|haps)
<PB N="4" REF="3">much more u&s;eful and valu|able things; to wit, many excel|lent Specific Remedies, for the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, and Pre&s;ervation of Health.</P>
<P>Nature had been &s;o kind to the poor ignorant Natives of that Coun|try, as to direct them to, and Ex|perience taught them, the peculiar Virtues of many Herbs, Roots, Plants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> growing among&s;t them, and how to apply them.</P>
<P>The Learned Phy&s;icians in no Age had ever the Knowledge of a more celebrated Specific Remedy for any Di&s;temper, than we in this la&s;t have found the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark to be, for a never failing and &s;ud|den Cure of Intermitting Fevers and Agues: And to which alone, &s;ince it has been generally us'd,
<PB N="5" REF="4">more Lives have been owing, than to any other Medicine what&s;oever. So wonderful is it in its Operation, that it looks almo&s;t like a Charm.</P>
<P>But above all, their Tobacco Plant de&s;erves to be plac'd in the fir&s;t Rank, for its many amicable Qualities and U&s;efulne&s;s to Human Bodies, for the Cure of &s;everal Di&s;tempers, Pre&s;ervation of Health, and Prolongation of Life. Be&s;ides the agreeable Diver&s;ion and Enter|tainment it affords to tho&s;e that u&s;e it. The <HI>Indians</HI> by their plen|tiful Smoaking and Chawing it, find great Relief for their inward Di&s;ea&s;es: And in ca&s;e of Wounds or Ulcers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they apply the Leaf, which eats away the proud Fle&s;h, and inclines the Sore to heal.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>It is an Opiat to tho&s;e that are in Pain, makes the Poor forget their Nece&s;&s;ities, &s;upplies Food to the Hungry, making them bear the Want of it ea&s;ily. It is well known how Armies have been en|abled to undergo tedious Marches, and Seamen long Voyages, with hardly any other Provi&s;ion, when well &s;upply'd with this.</P>
<P>It is endued with a Salutiferous Sulphur, and hath al&s;o a Narcotic compo&s;ing Quality, which gives Ea&s;e, Refre&s;hment, and Tranqui|lity both to the Body and Mind In&s;omuch that it may &s;eem to re|&s;emble the Famous Herb mention|ed by <HI>Homer,</HI> that had the Power to turn Sadne&s;s into Joy.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>The frequent Smoaking of To|bacco di&s;charges Phlegm and other watry peccant Humours out of the Glands. It removes Ob&s;tructions in the Ve&s;&s;els, by di&s;&s;olving the coagulated Juices: It promotes a due Circulation of the Blood, and a free Per&s;piration, thro' the Pores of the whole Body, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Health. It not only purges the Head, but with very many, ope|rates downwards, rendring the Bowels &s;oluble, whereby co&s;tive Con&s;titutions find great Benefit.</P>
<P>It de&s;troys Worms in Human Bodies, and is likewi&s;e by Experi|ence found to be a Remedy again&s;t Lepro&s;ies, Scurvy and Itch. To which the Poor (heretofore) inha|biting the Sea-Coa&s;t of this I&s;land, were by their Eating too much Fi&s;h
<PB N="8" REF="7">very much &s;ubject: But &s;ince the &s;moaking of Tobacco came to be much in U&s;e among them, they have been totally free from.</P>
<P>Chawing Tobacco is by many prefer'd to Smoaking it, as being a greater Drain, and communicating its Virtues and Warmth more effe|ctually to the Stomach and Brain; pre&s;erving the Teeth, killing the Worms, and altering the Juices that occa&s;ion Pain and Rottenne&s;s in them</P>
<P>By the Chawing it, the Glands of the Jaws, Throat and Ve&s;&s;els being continually mov'd and com|pre&s;s'd, di&s;mi&s;s or &s;pue out great Quantities of Rheum, the Cau&s;e of Defluctions, Coughs, Catarrhs and Con&s;umptions. It communi|cates al&s;o a certain Impul&s;e to the
<PB N="9" REF="8">Membranes of the Lungs, which helps their Di&s;charge of vicious Phlegm and other Matter, apt to breed Ulcers, A&s;tma's, and other Di&s;tempers. It's ob&s;erv'd by many, That tho&s;e who from their Youth have been accu&s;tom'd to chaw To|bacco, are never afflicted (or at lea&s;t very rarely) with Gout, Rheu|mati&s;ms, Scurvy, or Tooth-ach, which proceeds from an Acrimony in the Blood or Juices, that this Plant wonderfully helps to correct and &s;weeten.</P>
<P>As Smoaking and Chawing of Tobacco, by Experience, is found to have the&s;e good Effects; &s;o the u&s;ing it by way of Snuff is bene|ficial, as well as diverting, to many Per&s;ons, (e&s;pecially to &s;uch as have weak Eyes, affected with too much Moi&s;ture.) By its gently
<PB N="10" REF="9">pricking and &s;timulating the Mem|branes, it cau&s;es Sneezing or Con|tractions, whereby the Glands and Channels, like &s;o many &s;queez'd Sponges, di&s;mi&s;s their Sero&s;ities and Filth. And as it &s;erves for a Drain to exce&s;&s;ive Moi&s;ture in the Eyes or Head; &s;o when a &s;ufficient Moi&s;ture is wanting, its quick and noble Spirit opens the Ve&s;&s;els that afford Supplies thereto; and pure Snuff put into the Corners of the Eyes is found to alter and de&s;troy the &s;harp Humours that occa&s;ion Blood&s;hot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So beneficial is this Powder for the Pre&s;ervation of that mo&s;t dear and valuable of all our Sen&s;es, the Sight.</P>
<P>But Care ought to be taken, That the Snuff made u&s;e of in all the&s;e Ca&s;es be made of only pure clean Tobacco Leaves, without
<PB N="11" REF="10">any Mixture of Stiptic Earths, or Rotten Wood, which Common Snuff-makers put thereto to dea|den, colour, or el&s;e encrea&s;e the Quantity.</P>
<P>Tobacco al&s;o is often a Remedy for Deafne&s;s, by putting a Drop of its Oyl into the Ear with Cotton Wool.</P>
<P>But its mo&s;t u&s;eful and excellent Quality is &s;till to be mention'd; to wit, That it is the mo&s;t &s;ove|reign Antidote and greate&s;t Pre&s;er|vative again&s;t the Plague, or other pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;es; the Small-Pox, or other Infection.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> and others, among whom the Plague often rages, have recour&s;e to nothing more effectual to avoid it, than con&s;tant Smoaking of
<PB N="12" REF="11">Tobacco, Chawing, Snuffing, and burning it in their Rooms and Streets; and when the Pe&s;ti|lence is among them, many &s;tuff their Bedding and Pillows with it. The <HI>Indians</HI> where it grows hang it about their Necks, and are &s;el|dom &s;een without a Pipe in their Hand.</P>
<P>When the Plague raged &s;o vio|lently in <HI>London,</HI> in the Year 1665. it's well known to many now living, how very few it &s;eized of tho&s;e that were con&s;tant Smoakers and Chaw|ers of Tobacco: And what was more remarkable, not any of tho&s;e poor People, who&s;e Employment was to manufacture, roll, or cut Tobacco, of which there were many Hundreds at work in &s;everal Hou&s;es within this City, were in|fected.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>By the&s;e and many other In&s;tan|ces which might be given, it is evident, that Tobacco wonderfully helps to purify the Air, and pre|vent Infection; &s;o that it were very much to be wi&s;h'd, that in time of Pe&s;tilence and other infe|ctious Di&s;tempers, the Rich would be &s;o charitable, as to &s;upply the Poor with great Stores of this mo&s;t u&s;eful Drug, and &s;overeign Anti|dote in &s;uch Ca&s;es; which may be a Means to put a &s;top to the raging of &s;uch Di&s;tempers, and pre&s;erve whole Families.</P>
<P>But it is to be noted, there are many &s;orts and degrees of Tobacco Plants; and tho&s;e highly prefera|ble, which grow in Climates and Soils natural to them, having a
<PB N="14" REF="13">light Earth and warm Sun, which gives that noble Flavour, Strength and Virtue to that Tobacco produc'd in <HI>Brazil, New-Spain, Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mary-land:</HI> Whereas that Plant rai&s;ed in Northern Regions (where Tobacco-Plantations have of late mightily increa&s;ed) has not only a faint, earthy Ta&s;te and Smell, but is al&s;o very unwhol&s;om and perni|cious to tho&s;e that u&s;e it. In&s;tead of pre&s;erving, it de&s;troys Health; which though not &s;o immediately and &s;en&s;ibly felt by poor People of &s;trong and robu&s;t Con&s;titutions, yet it is certainly &s;o much Poi&s;on &s;uck'd into their Veins, which by Degrees con&s;umes the Body, and often im|mediately cau&s;es Vomitings, Ver|tigo's and Convul&s;ions.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>To conclude, All Per&s;ons who love long Life and Health, will daily have Recour&s;e to the <HI>Ameri|can</HI> Tobacco, as a noble Remedy; and &s;hun that of the <HI>European</HI> Growth, as Poi&s;on.</P>
