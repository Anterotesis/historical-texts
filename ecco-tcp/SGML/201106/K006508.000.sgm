<HEAD>THE USE of BATHING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>_BATHING has double&s;s been co|eval with mankind: cleanline&s;s and plea&s;ure would lead them early to it, and the advantages were evi|dent. The cold bath was the fir&s;t; for every pond and river gave the opportunity: and they who u&s;ed it found that they were &s;tronger in their bodies, and more lively in their imaginations than tho&s;e who did not. They found they e&s;caped &s;ickne&s;s al&s;o: it was natural to attribute this to the coldne&s;s, and thence to &s;eek for the &s;ame purpo&s;e the colde&s;t waters. Religion countenanced the practi&s;e, and purifications with water were made e&s;&s;ential ceremonies. Fraud followed: for an artful race of prie&s;ts, &s;en&s;ible of the good from bathing in extreme cold water, dedicated &s;prings to &s;aints, and the cures the
<PB N="7" REF="6">water made were attributed to the patron of the fountain.</P>
<P>WARM bathing followed naturally. The earth in many places &s;ends out hot &s;prings: the&s;e were more plea&s;ant to the fle&s;h in wa&s;h|ing, and they were therefore more u&s;ed: &s;ome who had coar&s;e eruptions on their &s;kin were cured by this entirely; in others head|achs cea&s;ed, and in many more complaints of long continuance vani&s;hed. One, tortured with the cholic, when he bathed found in|&s;tant ea&s;e; another who was dumb, from hoar&s;ne&s;s, &s;poke; and was frighted at the unaccu&s;tomed &s;ound of his own voice; a third bur&s;ting with &s;uppre&s;&s;ed urine, ex|pecting only ea&s;e, grew in&s;tantly relieved of his complaints.</P>
<P>THE effects appeared miraculous; and lying doctors as ignorant as prie&s;ts were cun|ning, attributed the&s;e cures to they knew not what minerals imprequating the Spring: ignorant: and de&s;irous their patiant &s;hould continue ignorant that all the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, and with the&s;e many more, might be cured by warm water only.</P>
<P>BUT before phy&s;icians interferred the practi&s;e &s;pread; and became, wherever there were the&s;e hot &s;prings univer&s;al.</P>
<P>WHERE they were wanting plain rea&s;on taught their nature, and tutored people to imitate them: common water was ea&s;ily warmed, and this performed the &s;ervice.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>THIS was all nature taught, and this they found &s;ufficient: ingenious art, ingenious for the u&s;es of the arti&s;t, &s;oon introduced a multitude of folly. Thus doctors who had fancied minerals in all the hot baths, becau&s;e they found them in a few, added them un|der various preparations to the&s;e they made art. Iron and copper became general ingre|dients, and they dreamed &s;omething of the vague acid, tho' they had not yet its name. The red hot &s;lags from iron-works and cop|per furnaces were thrown into the water and miracles attributed to them: and hence the unfeeling folly of the phy&s;icians came by de|grees to baths of INFANTS BLOOD.</P>
<P>BUT while we charge barbarous antiquity with the&s;e abu&s;es, let us except tho&s;e nations among whom &s;cience flouri&s;hed, and with it all true knowledge; from whom we have deduced our be&s;t di&s;coveries; and from whom we might borrow many more, if it were as much a cu&s;tom to &s;tudy, as 'tis a glory to pretend to &s;tudy them.</P>
<P>THE Greeks con&s;idered warm baths as warm water; but then they added plain and &s;imple things to a&s;&s;i&s;t the intention; bran, &s;oap, emollient herbs: no more. And they had fragrant oils and precious oint|ments to u&s;e afterwards, which &s;erved the two great needful purpo&s;es, refre&s;hing the &s;pirits, and preventing tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs which
<PB N="9" REF="8">might ot herwi&s;e have followed &s;udden cold.</P>
<P>What the&s;e were is a point involved in &s;ome ob&s;curity, for the originals &s;peak a broken language; and how&s;oever learned their com|mentators may have been in words, they were all wholly unacquainted with the things concerned. The Greek plants are le&s;s known than almo&s;t any other &s;ubject of anti|quity: with what &s;ucce&s;s they have been &s;ought by the namele&s;s author of the&s;e en|quiries, tho&s;e who have mo&s;t learning will be be&s;t able to determine: at lea&s;t they have been &s;ought with diligence and candour.</P>
<P>WHILE prie&s;thood, phy&s;ic, fraud, and folly were ob&s;curing the great light of nature in this in&s;tance, among people who were di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the fine term civilized, hone&s;t nature taught the Savages of other quarters not only the u&s;e of cold water, but to roll them&s;elves in &s;now: and not alone to plunge into the natural warm bath, or make one by the help of fire; but to &s;eize what&s;oever of|fered like it.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome places there ri&s;e hot vapours out of the earth, and on the&s;e they placed them&s;elves to grow warm by them: when this advantage did not offer they &s;eated
<PB N="10" REF="9">them&s;elves again&s;t a &s;and bank of earth which faced the &s;outh. In the middle of a clear hot day; and covering their feet with the loo&s;e du&s;t, &s;tood to be heated thoroughly; in other places they heated turfs; and lay on them, and were covered with them: and el&s;ewhere threw their bodies upon heaps of fermenting dung.</P>
<P>THUS nature led the way to the u&s;e of bathing, and it was well for the world while &s;cience only followed her &s;teps. Health was pre&s;orved by the cold baths, before 'twas known di&s;ea&s;es could be cured by them; and half the de&s;tructive legion of chronic complaints were cured familiarly. So much plain rea&s;on taught, and they were happy who obeyed her guidance.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the U&s;e of Bathing among the Greeks and Romans.</HEAD>
<P>EGYPT in the earlie&s;t times whereof we have account, adopted and improved the natural u&s;e of bathing, in both hot and cold water; and from that people probably the Greeks derived its rational u&s;e, together with their other knowledge. In this ca&s;e as all others, they &s;oon became more eminent than their originals: for what&s;oever they adopted they improved. In their heroic ages we read they bathed in rivers or the &s;ea, and there is rea&s;on to believe tho' facts are handed down from the&s;e uncertain times very ob&s;curely, that they di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;alt from fre&s;h water. Even hot baths were as early as the times when Homer lived: perhaps as tho&s;e concerning which he wrote. Pythagoras taught to his countrymen what he had learned in Egypt of their u&s;e; and from his time, tho' for &s;ome ages &s;lowly, they were made a regular part of medicine. From thence they were &s;oon brought into the li&s;ts of luxury, and then the cha&s;te manners of that honourable people would not &s;uffer them public. Tho&s;e who had occa&s;ion made them in their hou&s;es, and they were again given
<PB N="12" REF="11">back to the relief of &s;ickne&s;s; their natural and original u&s;e.</P>
<P>ROME borrowed them from Greece. Even the name Thermae is not of the other ori|gin. They con&s;idered them as an article of luxury and plea&s;ure, as much as of medicinal vertue: and after the fatigue of the day they prepared them&s;elves by bathing, rubbing and anointing, for the table and the plea&s;ures of the evening: both nations were wi&s;e enough to know, that which could pre&s;erve might al&s;o re&s;tore their health; and, by both the hot and the cold baths were u&s;ed al&s;o in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es. The Greek and Latin medicinal writers equally name them in this light, from Hippocrates downward to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>THE accounts we have of the manner of bathing for medicinal purpo&s;es are very ob|&s;cure, but 'tis mo&s;t probable they proceeded thus. The per&s;on who was to have the advan|tage of a warm bath, was led into an anti|chamber of the &s;tove; here he took off part of his habit: when warmed in this place he was led into the &s;tove; there he was &s;oon made very hot, and being wholly &s;tripped he was &s;et in a tub, and a quantity of warm water was poured upon his head: after this he plunged into the warm bath; and when he
<PB N="13" REF="12">came out of this he was rubbed dry, and then anointed with oils.</P>
<P>THIS was the compleat method: but in many ca&s;es a part of the ceremony only was u&s;ed, the warm rooms alone, or the&s;e and the warm water were e&s;teemed &s;ufficient; but always anointing with the oils clo&s;ed the ceremony.</P>
<P>THE cold bathing was conducted with le&s;s ceremony; but as rationally. The per&s;on was plunged into the water headlong; then when he came out he was rubbed dry, and after|wards he was anointed with oils.</P>
<P>THESE were the cu&s;toms of the Greeks, and from the&s;e the Romans varied but little. They grew carele&s;s, and made both kinds of bathing &s;lighter and more frequent among tho&s;e in health: but for the &s;ick the &s;ame methods &s;till were u&s;ed. Mi&s;chief hap|pened &s;ometimes from bathing, as well as often good: we better unde&s;tand the danger, but we have le&s;s &s;en&s;e of the real advantages; it may be therefore u&s;eful to endeavour to introduce again &s;ome of the neglected prac|tices of the Greeks; and to lay down before the public the di&s;ea&s;es in which bathing will be a cure; and the danger which may attend its improper u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the U&s;es of the Warm Bath.</HEAD>
<P>PERSPIRATION is a fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential to health: the ob&s;truction of this brings on fullne&s;s, fevers, pains in the head, and a multitude of other di&s;orders, all which may be removed at once by a proper u&s;e of the warm bath. The ob&s;truction of per&s;piration ari&s;es u&s;ually at once from the effect of cold; or more &s;lowly by cutaneous foulne&s;&s;es: The&s;e often begin from a &s;toppage of per|&s;piration, and they always encrea&s;e it. In either ca&s;e the warm bath is a cure.</P>
<P>IT relaxes the &s;kin and opens the pores, and nothing is &s;o effectual in cleaning away every kind of foulne&s;s. The &s;lighter di&s;orders which ri&s;e from an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, COLDS as we call them, and the whole train of their attendant &s;ymptoms vani&s;h at once, by the effect of a warm bath: this would make the recour&s;e to it univer&s;al in the&s;e ca&s;es, but that there follows the immediate danger of taking cold again: the effect of the chill air being the greater, as the pores have been left &s;o particularly open. Our cu&s;tom is to be put immediately into bed from a warm bath; but this is neither ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="15" REF="14">nor right, the effect has been pro|duced in the bath, and to what purpo&s;e &s;hould the per&s;on weaken him&s;elf, and open the pores yet more by a continued heat.</P>
<P>THE Greeks went from the bath into their heating rooms, and cooled gradually be|fore they went to bed. They under&s;tood the danger of expo&s;ing them&s;elves &s;uddenly to the cold air which they avoided, and even took precautions that the difference between the air of the bathing room and that of the apartment into which they went &s;hould not hurt them. The&s;e were rubbing and anoint|ing; and with the&s;e we, tho' our country is colder, might return from the warm bath into a warm apartment without danger. We &s;hould thus have all the advantages of the heat without weakening our&s;elves by it; and it would &s;et a&s;ide half the need of medicine.</P>
<P>THE u&s;es of warm bathing among the Greeks, exclu&s;ive of the mere con&s;ideration of luxury and amu&s;ement, may be reduced to three. 1&s;t. The relaxing of the &s;kin and opening of the pores. 2d. The clean&s;ing of cutaneous foulne&s;s and cure of the di&s;orders of the &s;kin. 3d. The &s;trengthening the parts, and conveying the virtues of power|ful medicines immediately to them.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>THE two fir&s;t are plain and obvious; but to the third &s;light readers will object, becau&s;e it &s;eems contradictory: the ab&s;olute effect of warm baths being not to &s;trengthen but re|lax: yet to this &s;eeming argument 'tis ea&s;y to oppo&s;e facts. The Greeks were faithful, and they name the effects: and to confirm this, we have in Hoffman, a writer &s;carce le&s;s accurate than them&s;elves, a &s;ingular ac|count of the Caroline baths, which, tho' hot, he &s;ays, &s;trengthen, not relax the parts, be|cau&s;e of the a&s;tringency of an ochreous earth contained in them.</P>
<P>THEREFORE the thing is practicable: what we have found done in one place by nature, they did by art at plea&s;ure; and it is certain they might do it better: for the virtues of a&s;tringent plants are much more ea&s;ily conveyed to water than tho&s;e of a&s;trin|gent earths.</P>
<P>A WARM bath is a general fomenta|tion: we may do what they did, and we have the means: What&s;oever effect a warm fomentation can take upon a limb by means of its ingredients, the &s;ame a warm bath impregnated with the &s;ame ingredients may on the whole body. Where the com|plaint is local we plainly &s;ee the good effects of medicated water, for fomentations in ge|neral
<PB N="17" REF="16">are no other; and where the malady is univer&s;al the &s;ame good will be attained by a bath made with the &s;ame ingredients.</P>
<P>WARM water an&s;wers the common pur|po&s;es alone; and whether this; or the medi|cated baths be u&s;ed, the &s;ame precautions will prevent all bad accidents.</P>
<P>WHAT is here advanced is the doctrine of plain rea&s;on &s;upported by antient medicine, I hope it will be &s;oon corroborated farther by the modern: I can propo&s;e it only: for 'tis an age in which &s;ome think, and others practi&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of bathing for relaxation only.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural u&s;e of warm bathing, which is only to relax the &s;kin and open the pores, nothing more need be con&s;idered than to have a pure light water for the purpo&s;e; and to avoid cold after|wards.</P>
<P>THE Greeks, whom I would propo&s;e as models, we &s;ee, fir&s;t warmed the body gra|dually, for this practi&s;e, by the air of a heated room; then poured on warm water, and im|mediately gave the bath: then after rub|bing dry, they u&s;ed their oils: It will be an addition to our common practice to ob&s;erve this gradual preparation for the bath; and it is worth while to enquire diligently after the Compo&s;ition of tho&s;e medicines, which they have mentioned as of &s;o much impor|tance.</P>
<P>THE effects a&s;cribed to them by candid writers, &s;hew they de&s;erved that prai&s;e: but as to the compo&s;ition of them we are altoge|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and negligent; neither affect|ing to know them, nor attempting to imitate them. We want them more than they did:
<PB N="19" REF="18">for our climate being colder, the danger of taking cold, which they were invented to obviate, is with us greater.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Grecian oils and ointments.</HEAD>
<P>IF we would learn any thing truly of the oils and ointments u&s;ed by the antient Greeks after warm bathing, we mu&s;t fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e employed upon different occa&s;ions. They had in all three kinds: the fir&s;t were an article of luxury, and in the&s;e only fragrance was con&s;idered; the &s;econd kind were for tho&s;e who u&s;ed great bodily exerci&s;e; and the third for health. The&s;e la&s;t alone were for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who bathed.</P>
<P>THE fragrant ointments came in at all great entertainments with the &s;econd cour&s;e, when the gue&s;ts dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in flowery gar|lands; the &s;econd &s;ort were very &s;imple, and were furni&s;hed at the public expence; the third alone employed the care of the phy&s;icians. The&s;e were compo&s;ed with &s;o good a choice of the ingredients, and &s;o much care, and &s;uch perfect art in com|pounding, that it would be well if modern pharmacy would copy them.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P>THE receipts for &s;everal of the&s;e are pre|&s;erved by Dio&s;cordes; but the earlie&s;t and mo&s;t celebrated mu&s;t be traced much higher. The&s;e re&s;earches are &s;o &s;lightly practi&s;ed now, that men think it a great thing if they can quote Pliny. An author is produced as an authority who&s;e errors are more numerous than his paragraphs: for often one of the&s;e has been compiled from half a dozen former writers; no two of whom were of the &s;ame opinion. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, if we take this collector's word we &s;hall believe the Greeks adopted Per&s;ian cu&s;toms only in this matter; and that the fir&s;t che&s;t of ointments their country &s;aw was taken by Alexander in the tent of Darius.</P>
<P>WHERE Pliny found &s;uch a piece of hi&s;tory none knows, but 'tis a&s;toni&s;hing he &s;hould adopt it. Ointments of the&s;e kinds are named by authors who wrote long be|fore the time of Alexander; and the Greek comedies, of the earlie&s;t date, rally this piece of luxury. Alcaeus Sappho and Anacreon we find plainly knew them, and &s;poke of them as things in common u&s;e: Sophocles &s;cents with the&s;e precious unguents his Venus, and anoints his Pallas: the ver&s;es of Archilochus named them; and it would be ridiculous to think the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of Homer meant any
<PB N="21" REF="20">other than an ointment of which ro&s;es were the ba&s;e, and the receipt of which is yet ex|tant in Dio&s;cordes. <GAP DESC="foreign"> is the more com|mon term, but they meant nothing el&s;e al&s;o by their <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>THE Romans had the like ointments ear|ly; and were extravagant in them to an ex|ce&s;s: they imported &s;uch as they fancied A&s;ia produced better than their own, after the de|feat of Antiochus; and it was an article of luxury, carried &s;oon to &s;o high an abu&s;e, that the cen&s;ors pa&s;&s;ed a &s;olemn ordonance that no exotic oils &s;hould be brought into the country.</P>
<P>THESE were the compo&s;itions with which Toti madebant, as their Poets &s;poke it; and the&s;e only were interdicted. They had at home the choice&s;t &s;affron, and the drugs for many others; and they were at liberty &s;till to to import myrrh and &s;pices, the principal ingredients of the re&s;t, u&s;eful in the pre&s;er|vation of health. The&s;e they had learned from the cha&s;te and hardy Greeks: others from &s;ofter, and effeminate nations.</P>
<P>AMONG the oils and ointments &s;acred to health, the principal were tho&s;e which made a part of the bathing operations: by which
<PB N="22" REF="21">they prevented all the dangerous con&s;e|quences that could have attended the warm bath; and availed them&s;elves of all its po&s;|&s;ible benefits.</P>
<P>THEIR intent in the&s;e compo&s;itions was to &s;top the pores, warm the body, and re|fre&s;h the &s;pirits. The very nature of the oil an&s;wer'd, in a great mea&s;ure, the fir&s;t purpo&s;e; the warmth of the &s;pices did the &s;econd; and the natural fragrance of the&s;e and the re&s;t of the ingredients, took the place of A&s;iatic luxury in performing the la&s;t. We in our baths want the&s;e helps; and 'tis to the inventors of the receipts we are to look up for them.</P>
<P>THE general ingredients were oil and &s;pices: and the u&s;ual method of compo&s;ition was this. They boiled the common &s;pices in the oil, and afterwards added the more rich and fragrant; cautious that their virtues would have been lo&s;t if added before boiling. They were u&s;ually compo&s;ed of many ingredients; and had their names from the principal. Sometimes they made them by in&s;olation, expo&s;ing the oils and ingredients a long time to the &s;un, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of fire: to &s;ome they added a little wax; and &s;ometimes, if we believe Galen, re&s;in: to
<PB N="23" REF="22">others al&s;o they plainly added vinegar. The <GAP DESC="foreign"> as they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves were tho&s;e which had wax, and were to be rub|bed into the fle&s;h; and their <GAP DESC="foreign"> were &s;uch as had only the oils and &s;pices, and were ju&s;t poured upon the body. The lat|ter were properly oils, and the former oint|ments.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould do well to imitate the care wherewith the Greeks &s;elected their in|gredients. The oil for this purpo&s;e was pre&s;&s;ed from unripe olives; and had there|fore an a&s;tringency, which no common oil has: and as they found this nece&s;&s;ary quality was lo&s;t after a time, the oil mellowing with keeping, they never u&s;ed it except fre&s;h. We know the danger of cold after a bath is from the relaxed &s;tate of the &s;kin, and ex|treme openne&s;s of the pores; we under&s;tand oil fills them, and that way prevents ta|king cold: but we &s;ee al&s;o the Greek oil con&s;tringed them; even before it had the virtue of the &s;pices.</P>
<P>THE oil in mo&s;t frequent u&s;e with the Greeks after bathing was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the oil of ro&s;es. The compo&s;ition we have in Dio&s;cordes, and it was excellent. The &s;ingle red ro&s;e was the flower u&s;ed in this; it was taken ju&s;t in the bud,
<PB N="24" REF="23">and only the red put in, the white heel being cut off becau&s;e le&s;s a&s;tringent: the&s;e ro&s;e buds were pre&s;&s;ed to pieces in the hands, anointed fir&s;t with honey. They were put into this oil of unripe olives: as many were u&s;ed as the oil would con|tain; and they were worked about in it: after this they &s;tood all night, and in the next morning they pre&s;&s;ed out the oil. They added then fre&s;h ro&s;e buds, in an equal quan|tity, and managed them in the &s;ame manner: they repeated this to the &s;eventh time. To this oil they added &s;ome more of the &s;ame kind &s;cented with &s;chaenanth, by boiling that ingredient fir&s;t in oil and water.</P>
<P>WE have no &s;uch compo&s;itions as this now made. Tho&s;e who prepare medicines have not the Grecian indu&s;try, nor tho&s;e who pre&s;cribe the receipts, the Grecian knowledge. We have an oil of ro&s;es: but how is it made? ro&s;es are boiled in oil till they are cri&s;p, and the oil is then pre&s;s'd out. The preparation is ea&s;y, but having no vir|tue it is neglected. Tho&s;e who make me|dicines &s;hould be told this &s;even times re|peated maceration of the Greeks gives &s;eventy times the virtue of one boiling; and their directors &s;hould al&s;o know, that he who fir&s;t ordered the breaking of the ro&s;es to be per|formed

<PB N="25" REF="25">with hands anointed with honey, knew there was a peculiar power in that &s;ub|&s;tance of di&s;&s;olving the be&s;t part of the ro&s;e, and making it mix with the oil.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee how things incapable of mixture by them&s;elves are brought to it by the addi|tion of &s;ome third &s;ub&s;tance, the yolk of an egg thus mixes turpentine and water; and the volatile alkalies mix water and oil: Ho|ney has the &s;ame effect in mixing oil with the mo&s;t perfect and effectual part of this flower. It is originally it&s;elf a vegetable &s;ub|&s;tance, and has the quality of uniting the oleaginous and a&s;tringent parts of other ve|getables.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee the path we are to follow if we would recover the advantages of bathing: we mu&s;t pur&s;ue their &s;teps who fir&s;t di&s;co|vered them. Our oil of ro&s;es wou'd act merely as fat: But this is &s;omething more. The unripe oil has its own au&s;tere quality, and by this repeated maceration it wou'd have all the a&s;tringency of that noble flower. We cannot well &s;cent it with &s;chaenanth, for the light flavour of that herb is lo&s;t in drying: but as they expected only a &s;cent from this, we need not lament the lo&s;s: a very &s;mall quantity of winter's bark boil'd the &s;ame
<PB N="26" REF="26">way wou'd an&s;wer its purpo&s;e; or the medicine wou'd have equal effect without it.</P>
<P>THUS we may &s;upply our&s;elves with the plain and familiar oil u&s;ed in the Grecian and Roman baths: and we may for the delicate or curious go much farther. Great Per&s;ons among them us'd on the&s;e occa&s;ions oils or unguents approaching to the nature of tho&s;e imported from the A&s;iatics, for lux|ury. The&s;e were cordial as well as pro|perly a&s;tringent: for it is certain cordials may in a certain degree, be conveyed by the &s;cent.</P>
<P>AMONG their co&s;tly ointments, the princi|pal were three: they took their names from &s;pikenard, cinnamon, and &s;affron. The fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e were merely articles of lux|ury; but that which had its name from cin|namon, was an invention of Theophra&s;tus; and he, who was too great and hone&s;t to en|courage the follies of his countrymen, meant it for u&s;e after bathing. It long continued the fir&s;t and mo&s;t reputed unguent for that purpo&s;e. According to the accounts extant, concering it 'twas made thus.</P>
<P>Grind to a fine powder four ounces of the pure&s;t myrrh; add to this three ounces of
<PB N="27" REF="27">thin honey, &s;uch as runs freely from the comb, rub the&s;e a long time together, add|ing &s;ome juice of the blo&s;&s;oms of the vine.</P>
<P>THESE flowers of the vine were what the old Greeks called aenanthe, and 'twas the plain &s;en&s;e of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">. Some ra&s;h tran&s;|lators fancied they meant the plant which we call now aenanthe, the water dropwort. They made an unguent from rough oil and blo&s;&s;oms of the vine alone: but the mo&s;t judicious prefer'd the <GAP DESC="foreign"> to that; and u&s;ed tho&s;e flowers only in this compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>WHEN the myrrh honey and juice have been a long time worked together, add oil of the ben nut (this was the famous <GAP DESC="foreign">) two quarts: mix the&s;e, and then &s;tir in of co&s;tus and amomum, each one ounce, brui&s;ed, and &s;chaenanth cut &s;mall, half an ounce; put in a pint of water, and boil the whole till the water is evaporated. Powder three ounces of choice cinnamon. Cover the &s;ides and bottom of an earthen ve&s;&s;el with honey; put into it the powder of cinnamon, and then &s;train in the oil from the other ingredi|ents. Expo&s;e this to the &s;un a month: then add one ounce of more cinnamon powdered; let it &s;tand ten days longer, and then &s;train it off.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="28">
<P>THIS with the common qualities of oil, had a &s;ufficient a&s;tringency, and a cordial virtue. This the great per&s;ons among the Greeks u&s;ed when they aro&s;e from the bath; and prepared for their evening entertainments: Their &s;laves rubbed it all over their bodies. It was expen&s;ive, but 'twas well worth the Price. The receipt here given is not any where entire; for it was among the lo&s;t works of Theophra&s;tus; but we collect it piece meal among the ine&s;timable remnants of anti|quity. Dio&s;corides has an ointment of the &s;ame name, but it wants &s;ome of the original ingredients; and &s;eems an imperfect receipt only of one of the luxurious unguents of the &s;oft A&s;iaticks.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the U&s;e of the warm Bath in England, with the Grecian Ointments.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to the other u&s;es of warm bathing, let us con&s;ider what might be the benefit of the practice, with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the mo&s;t common ca&s;es.</P>
<P>COLDS are very frequent from the irregu|lar weather of our climate: they are trou|ble&s;ome and painful in them&s;elves; and they bring on three fourths of the other di&s;ea&s;es. A warm bath will be a certain cure for the&s;e; and this ointment will pre|vent all danger.</P>
<P>LOWNESS OF SPIRITS is another national di&s;order. This ri&s;es often from repletion only; and this will be always cured as infal|libly by the &s;ame practice.</P>
<P>HEAD-ACHS are almo&s;t as common; and often they are inveterate. We know, that placing the feet in warm water frequently cures them: a compleat warm bath wou'd do it always.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="30">
<P>WE &s;hall treat pre&s;ently of tho&s;e other di&s;orders, which may be cured by warm bathing; the per&s;on being &s;ecured from dan|ger by one of the&s;e ointments.</P>
<P>FOR the common purpo&s;e bagnio's mu&s;t not be u&s;ed, for there will be danger always in returning from them. The bath mu&s;t be at home: and nothing is &s;o ea&s;y. Let the ba|thing tub be large enough, let rain water be u&s;ed; or if that cannot be had, any &s;oft wa|ter; and let the per&s;on go into it between &s;e|ven and eight in the evening.</P>
<P>HE &s;hould remain in it about twelve mi|nutes; then let warm cloths be ready to wipe him dry, and with his own hands let him rub over his body with a little of one or the other of the&s;e ointments. This &s;hou'd be the common practice; and for this u&s;e, the cinnamon ointment is mo&s;t proper. Or when an extream cold, or a de&s;perate head-ach re|quire &s;taying longer in the water, the ro&s;e oil &s;hou'd be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>AFTER rubbing with this, he &s;hou'd put on ea&s;y and warm cloaths, and going into his dining-room, warmed by a good fire; wait there for &s;upper.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="31">
<P>IF there were only plea&s;ure meant by this, it would be excellently worth the trouble; for the ea&s;e and refre&s;hment which follow, are not to be de&s;cribed: chearfulne&s;s and a good appetite attend uon it; and there will be le&s;s danger even in too much wine, after this, than at any other time.</P>
<P>IF every gentleman in England wou'd thus far copy the manners of the Greeks and Romans, he would feel what he &s;o often hears, that they were the happie&s;t people in the world.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the U&s;e of the warm Baths, with the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of the Smegmata of the Greeks.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es are to be cu|red by the warm bath, the fir&s;t article is perfectly cleaning the &s;kin; and to this pur|po&s;e it is ea&s;y to add &s;ome ingredient to the water, which will a&s;&s;i&s;t. The Greeks, whom I would make our ma&s;ters in this article, had many &s;uch, exceeding one another in power; which they u&s;ed &s;everally according to the ob&s;tinacy of the di&s;order. The&s;e they called &s;megmata: and to the&s;e it will be proper we have recour&s;e for the &s;ame &s;ervice. The milde&s;t of them were the chaffy &s;ub&s;tance, &s;eparated from the pul&s;e kinds, as bran from the flour of wheat. Of all the pul&s;e kind, they prefer'd for this purpo&s;e the cicer or chich: this was their Erebinthos, &s;o celebrated and &s;o ju&s;tly. We know the effect of bran; but this has much more. They &s;eperated only a part of the meal from this, and beating up the hu&s;ky remains into a pa&s;te, with a little water, they u&s;ed this as &s;oap. The per&s;on after he had been &s;ome time in the warm water, to &s;often the &s;curff and other foulne&s;s, rubbed him&s;elf gently with this pa&s;te of the
<PB N="33" REF="33">chich bran, and letting it melt off with the water, wa&s;hed him&s;elf, and then rubbed on more of it. Thus by degrees the foulne&s;s was got away. It was not the work of one day or of two, but they were contented to bring it on by &s;low degrees. After this had been done a week, or more, they began &s;craping the whole body while in the bath, with knives, who&s;e blades were of gold. This perfected the clean&s;ing of the &s;urface, after the opening of the pores by the bath, as we &s;hall &s;hew in the next chapter.</P>
<P>WHEN this was not &s;ufficient, they u&s;ed al&s;o an alkaline &s;alt. This has been little under&s;tood, for it was called an earth. There ri&s;es at this time upon the &s;urface of the ground, a &s;alt of the fixed alkaline kind, in many parts of the ea&s;t: they have it about Smyrna now, and it is called &s;oap earth, be|cau&s;e it an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of &s;oap; the principal ingredient of which is a fixed al|kali.</P>
<P>A &s;mall quantity of this &s;alt was di&s;&s;olved in the water of the bath; and the chich bran was u&s;ed as before, which with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance had double effect. It is the quality of the fixed alkaline &s;alts to &s;often water, and a &s;mall quantity of &s;ome of them &s;hould
<PB N="34" REF="34">always be added, when no &s;ufficiently &s;oft water can be had.</P>
<P>IT would be ea&s;y to obtain the&s;e Ingredi|ents, tho' they are not at pre&s;ent in common u&s;e; and it would be highly proper: I wou'd recommend not only the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the Greek in&s;truction, but the very letter. One alkaline &s;alt may indeed &s;erve this pur|po&s;e, as well as another, for there is very little difference between them: but it is not &s;o with regard to the farinaceous vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. A little pearl a&s;hes may be u&s;ed in the place of the &s;oap earth, but we have nothing that will &s;upply equally well the place of the cicer.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Virtues of the Grecian Cicer.</HEAD>
<P>THE mealy part of this pul&s;e is the &s;oft|e&s;t of all farinaceous powders; and the &s;kins have not the har&s;h and hu&s;ky nature of bran, or of the hulls of oatmeal; every one knows the rinds of corn are hard: the chich is of the pea kind, and its &s;kin is naturally &s;oft and tough. It mellows in the warm water, and becomes extremely fit for rub|bing on the &s;kin; and its emollient quality is la&s;ting.</P>
<P>'TIS ea&s;y to be rai&s;ed in our gardens; being as hardy as the common pea: and there is another virtue which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in an eminent degree, and which &s;hould re|commend it farther: It may be eaten as pea&s;e; and is the mo&s;t &s;trengthening of all foods. Its peculiar virtue is as a provoca|tive to venery. This it does &s;afely; not by &s;timulating the organs, but by &s;upplying the juices, therefore the u&s;e of it is innocent, and the benefit is natural and la&s;ting. Men who&s;e de&s;ires outlived their faculties among the old Greeks, prolonged the &s;ea&s;on of delight by this pul&s;e, many years: and if a greater in|&s;tance may be given of its effects from their
<PB N="36" REF="36">time to the pre&s;ent, it is in tho&s;e countries where the u&s;e is known, and where it is given to &s;tallions, when too much exhau&s;ted; and always with &s;ucce&s;s. The old Greeks eat the&s;e Chiches &s;tewed in gravy; they ap|peared at all general entertainments, and this was called the old man's di&s;h. Young peo|ple were a&s;hamed to be &s;een eating of it: they thought it acknowledged want of vigour.</P>
<P>THE fruit in the pod is &s;ometimes white, &s;ometimes red, and &s;ometimes black; the red was always cho&s;en for the table for this pur|po&s;e, and it obtained among them the name CICER VENEREUM the POVOCATIVE CHICH. The &s;eeds may be had with us: but as our people through ignorance or fraud, often &s;ell lentills under their name, it will be proper to add a de&s;cription and a figure of the plant, that tho&s;e who wi&s;h to have the benefit of its virtues, may not be di&s;appointed. It grows to eighteen inches high, with a weak, yet hard &s;talk: the leaves are of delicate pale green, and the flower is crim&s;on; the pods are bloated and the &s;eeds are red. If it be &s;own in April in a common kitchen garden, there will be many gatherings during &s;ummer; and if a quantity of the chiches be dried as we do pea&s;e for keeping, they will pre&s;erve all their virtue.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIX.</HI> Of the medicated Baths of the Antients.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN more was required from bathing than opening the pores and clean&s;ing the &s;kin, the antients u&s;ed ingredients proper for the relief of per&s;ons in &s;uch particular ca&s;es, and made their baths, as has been ob|&s;erved before, a kind of general fomentations.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;es of cutaneous foulne&s;s, which did not yeld to &s;ingle bathing, they infu&s;ed the roots of <HI>docks</HI> and <HI>figwort</HI> in the water: where more &s;oftening was required, they had recour&s;e to large quantities of mallows; and for extream weakne&s;s, they u&s;ed myrtle.

<P>NOTHING can be plainer then the rea&s;on|ablene&s;s of this practice: and it would be an honour to our phy&s;icians to introduce and re|commend it.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Dangers which attend warm Bathing.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal and mo&s;t obvious of the&s;e is taking cold afterwards; which 'tis ea&s;y to avoid: But there are al&s;o particular con|&s;titutions with which the Practice will not agree; and &s;ome di&s;orders in which 'tis hurt|ful. More is &s;aid of this by &s;y&s;tematic wri|ters than is true: but what experience &s;eems to &s;hew is this.</P>
<P>IN all hectic habits it is hurtful: in the jaundice it has been known to do mi&s;chief; and in the drop&s;y it would be madne&s;s to think of it; nor &s;hould it be u&s;ed by any, even by tho&s;e who are well, in times of contagious di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THESE are the ca&s;es wherein the warm bath never &s;hould be employed; but with the&s;e exceptions it may be recommended generally.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;es wherein it may be &s;erviceable, are many. Hy&s;teric complaints will be cured by this without the help of medicines; and hypocondrical ca&s;es in men, as they are

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of Cold Bathing.</HEAD>
<P>THE cold bath, though of va&s;t and various u&s;e, is a more limited &s;ub|ject: for the plain and &s;imple plunging into cold water is all. Here need no oint|ments, nor no &s;megmata, the immediate action of the water upon the body is the whole; and there is no danger of cold afterwards.</P>
<P>YET even here there mu&s;t be &s;ome cau|tion: for what&s;oever can do good, may al&s;o do harm; and generally the power of mi&s;chief is proportioned to that of ad|vantage.</P>
<P>NOT only the phy&s;icians of antiquity re|commended the cold bath; but all their ra|tional authors, in who&s;e way it came to mention the &s;ubject. The &s;ea and rivers have been cold baths from all time: but tho&s;e are better which are covered from the &s;un, and fed immediately from the living &s;pring. The coldne&s;s is all, and therefore the more cold, certainly the better. They talk idly who call in mechanic principles, and mea&s;ure
<PB N="41" REF="41">the den&s;ity of the atmo&s;phere, and the pre&s;|&s;ure of the water. The immediate effect of plunging into cold water, is a &s;udden and violent contraction of the fibres: this may naturally produce all the great effects we find from the cold bath; and do the mi&s;chief al&s;o which we &s;ometimes hear from its im|proper u&s;e. Rea&s;on is the be&s;t guide in matters of health; and when her doctrines are confirmed by experience, &s;he is placed above the reach of error: Tho&s;e who go farther fool them&s;elves; and it were well if that were all, but where the doctor doats the patient dies.</P>
<P>'TIS certain that cold bathing gives relief in very many and de&s;perate ca&s;es, where all medicines fail: nor is its power le&s;s in pre|venting others</P>
<P>WHICH of the various maladies, whereto this weak frame is &s;ubjected, do not ari&s;e from, or may not be aggravated by the effect of colds? The&s;e, cold bathing obviates en|tirely. It &s;trengthens the whole body, and defends it from tho&s;e injuries of the weather to which our fickle climate makes us &s;ubject hourly. 'Tis therefore a practic u&s;efulevery where, yet in a manner appropriated here.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="42">
<P>IN regard to particular ca&s;es, we &s;ee daily that pains and &s;ickne&s;s, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, and the mo&s;t dejecting weakne&s;s which op|pre&s;s people who are accu&s;tomed to warm rooms and delicate management, are all cured by the cold bath; the per&s;on &s;carce believing that he is the &s;ame man. His mind &s;eeming to have &s;hared the advantage of his body; chearful good humour &s;ucceeding pining peevi&s;hne&s;s, and vigour faintne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e di&s;charges which remain after frequent or ill cured venereal di&s;orders, there is nothing equal to the cold bath. Bal&s;ams and a&s;tringent electuaries, vomits, and &s;typ|tic injections, have in many ca&s;es been u&s;ed even years in vain; when a few days of this practice have made a perfect cure.</P>
<P>THAT mi&s;erable weakne&s;s which wa&s;tes the &s;trength of &s;ome young men, from a different and le&s;s excu&s;eable cau&s;e, which robs them at once of the enjoyments and advantages of marriage; and in the end often entails upon them epelip&s;ies, is cured con|&s;tantly and certainly by this: injecting the cold water after bathing.</P>
<P>WE know what cures, indeed what mi|racles are recorded of the famous PFEFFER
<PB N="43" REF="43">WATER on the ALPS, a remedy for half the di&s;ea&s;es to which men are &s;ubject: many have tried, and &s;everal among them who di&s;be|lieved; but they have found it true. The water of this celebrated cavern is clear and ta&s;tele&s;s; nor could tho&s;e who wondered at the cures which it performed, ever di&s;cover any ingredient in it, to which they &s;hould attribute them. The &s;agacious Scheukzer foil'd the famous Arabian, he found the water was mere water, and that cold bathing was the my&s;tery. The place where this &s;trange flood bur&s;ts from the rock a&s;&s;i&s;ts; for 'tis &s;o high upon the mountain, that the air it&s;elf is colder than below, and the &s;pot where nature has provided the fir&s;t re&s;ervoir of it is in a hollow, open to the colde&s;t winds, but &s;o defended to the Southward that the &s;un never &s;hines into it.</P>
<P>TRUTH and plain rea&s;on therefore give to cold bathing, all the virtues of this famous &s;pring; and they are no &s;mall addition to the received and certain number of the benefits of cold baths. Tho&s;e who would know the&s;e perfectly mu&s;t try: they need not vi&s;it the frozen Alps, nor any of the other famous fountains; &s;pring water kept cold, will work as many wonders.</P>
