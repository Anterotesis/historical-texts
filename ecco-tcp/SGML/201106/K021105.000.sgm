* Survey book for troublesome formats of all kinds, including lists, illustrations, tables, music, math, end-notes, quasi-tabular arrangments, and marginalia. Made sure that it was correctly tagged. Decide how much is worth changing.
* Look for unobtrusive numerations and other occult signs of structure.
* Look for illustrations, make sure that usable text within them has been captured and correctly tagged.
* Add FIGDESCs to any and all likely illustrations.
* Check for =""
* Check for "q;"
* Check placement and completeness of PBs.
* Check for GAPs and #s.
