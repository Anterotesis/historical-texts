<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE we proceed farther in the bu&s;ine&s;s of this day, permit me to acquaint you with the judgment of your Council, in the di&s;po&s;al of Sir GODFREY COPLEY'S medal; an office I have undertaken at their reque&s;t, and with the greater &s;atisfaction, as I am confident you will be no le&s;s unanimous in giving your approbation, than they have been in addre&s;&s;ing you for it upon this occa|&s;ion. For though they were not in&s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;t title that &s;everal of the Papers, compo&s;ing the pre&s;ent vo|lume of your Tran&s;actions, had to your particular notice, yet they did not he&s;itate in preferring that which I pre|&s;ented to you from Captain COOK, giving <HI>An account of the method he had taken to pre&s;erve the health of the crew of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the</HI> Re&s;olution <HI>during her late voyage
<PB N="2" REF="3">round the world</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Paper it&s;elf, read at the Society in March la&s;t, with an Extract of a letter from Captain COOK to the Pre&s;ident, dated Plymouth, the 7th of July fol|lowing, are both &s;ubjoined to this di&s;cour&s;e.</NOTE>. Indeed I imagine that the name alone of &s;o worthy a member of this Society would have in|clined you to depart from the &s;trictne&s;s of your rules, by conferring upon him that honour, though you had re|ceived no direct communication from him; con&s;idering how meritorious in your eyes that per&s;on mu&s;t appear, who hath not only made the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, but the mo&s;t in&s;tructive voyages, who hath not only di&s;covered, but &s;urveyed, va&s;t tracts of new coa&s;ts, who hath di&s;pelled the illu&s;ion of a <HI>terra au&s;tralis incognita,</HI> and fixed the bounds of the habitable earth, as well as tho&s;e of the na|vigable ocean, in the Southern Hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not, however, expatiate on that ample field of prai&s;e, but confine my di&s;cour&s;e to what was the inten|tion of this honorary premium, namely, to crown that Paper of the year which &s;hould contain the mo&s;t u&s;eful and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful experimental inquiry. Now what in|quiry can be &s;o u&s;eful as that which hath for its object the &s;aving the lives of men? and when &s;hall we find one more &s;ucce&s;sful than that before us? Here are no vain boa&s;tings of the empiric, nor ingenious and delu&s;ive theo|ries of the dogmati&s;t; but a conci&s;e, an artle&s;s, and an incon|te&s;ted
<PB N="3" REF="4">relation of the means, by which, <HI>Under the divine favour, Captain</HI> COOK, <HI>with a company of a hundred and eighteen men, performed a voyage of three years and eigh|teen days, throughout all the climates from fifty-two degrees North to &s;eventy-one degrees South, with the lo&s;s of only one man by a di&s;ea&s;e</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a <HI>phthi&s;is pulmonalis</HI> terminating in a drop&s;y. Mr. PATTEN, &s;urgeon to the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> who mentioned to me this ca&s;e, ob&s;erved that this man began &s;o early to complain of a cough and other con&s;umptive &s;ymptoms, which had never left him, that his lungs mu&s;t have been affected before he came on board.</NOTE>. What mu&s;t enhance to us the value of the&s;e &s;alutary ob&s;ervations, is to &s;ee the practice hath been no le&s;s &s;imple than efficacious.</P>
<P>I would now inquire of the mo&s;t conver&s;ant in the &s;tudy of Bills of Mortality, whether in the mo&s;t healthful cli|mate, and in the be&s;t condition of life, they have ever found &s;o &s;mall a number of deaths in &s;uch a number of men, within that period of time? How great and agreeable then mu&s;t our &s;urprize be, after peru&s;ing the hi&s;tories of long navigations in former days, when &s;o many peri&s;hed by marine di&s;ea&s;es, to find the air of the &s;ea acquitted of all malignity, and in fine that a voyage round the world may be undertaken with le&s;s danger to health than a common tour in Europe!</P>
<P>But the better to &s;ee the contra&s;t between the old and the pre&s;ent times, allow me to recall to your memory
<PB N="4" REF="5">what you have read of the fir&s;t voyage for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Ea&s;t-India Company. The equipment con|&s;i&s;ting of four &s;hips, with four hundred and eighty men, three of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els were &s;o weakened by the &s;curvy, by the time they had got only three degrees beyond the Line, that the merchants, who had embarked on this adventure, were obliged to do duty as common &s;ailors; and there died in all, at &s;ea, and on &s;hore at Soldania (a place of re|fre&s;hment on this &s;ide of the Cape of Good-Hope) one hundred and five men, which was near a fourth part of their complement. And hath not Sir RICHARD HAW|KINS, an intelligent as well as brave officer, who lived in that age, recorded, that <HI>in twenty years, during which he had u&s;ed the &s;ea, he could give an account of ten thou&s;and ma|riners who had been con&s;umed by the &s;curvy alone?</HI> Yet &s;o far was this author from mi&s;taking the di&s;ea&s;e, that I have peru&s;ed few who have &s;o well de&s;cribed it. If then in tho&s;e early times, the infancy I may call them of the commerce and naval power of England, &s;o many were carried off by that bane of &s;ea-faring people, what mu&s;t have been the de&s;truction afterwards, upon the great aug|mentation of the fleet, and the opening of &s;o many new ports to the trade of Great-Britain, whil&s;t &s;o little advance|ment was made in the nautical part of medicine?</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing from tho&s;e old dates to one within the re|membrance of many here pre&s;ent, when it might have been expected that whatever tended to aggrandize the naval power of Britain, and to extend her commerce, would have received the highe&s;t improvement; yet we &s;hall find, that even at this late period few mea&s;ures had been taken to pre&s;erve the health of &s;eamen, more than had been known to our unin&s;tructed ance&s;tors. Of this a&s;&s;ertion the victorious, but mournful, expedition of Com|modore ANSON affords too convincing a proof. It is well known, that &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ing the Streights of Le Maire, the &s;curvy began to appear in his &s;quadron; that by the time the <HI>Centurion</HI> had advanced but a little way into the South-&s;ea, forty-&s;even had died of it in this &s;hip; and that there were few on board who had not, in &s;ome degree, been affected with the di&s;temper, though they had not been then eight months from England. That in the ninth month, when &s;tanding for the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, &s;he lo&s;t double that number; and that the mortality went on at &s;o great a rate (I &s;till &s;peak of the Commodore's &s;hip) that, before &s;he arrived there, &s;he had buried two hun|dred; and at la&s;t could mu&s;ter no more than &s;ix of the common men in a watch capable of doing duty. This was the condition of one of the three &s;hips which reached that i&s;land; the other two &s;uffered in proportion.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<P>Nor did the tragedy end here; for after a few months re&s;pite, the &s;ame fatal &s;ickne&s;s broke out afre&s;h and made &s;uch havock, that before the <HI>Centurion</HI> (which now con|tained the whole &s;urviving crews of the three &s;hips) had got to the i&s;land of Tinian, there died &s;ometimes eight or ten in a day; in&s;omuch that when they had been two years on the voyage, they had lo&s;t a larger proportion than that of four in five of their original number; and, by the account of the hi&s;torian, all of them, after their entering the South Sea, of the &s;curvy. I &s;ay by the account of the elegant writer of the voyage, for as he neither was in the medical line him&s;elf, nor hath authenticated this part of his narrative by appealing to the &s;urgeons of the &s;hip or their journals, I &s;hould doubt that this was not &s;trictly the ca&s;e; but rather, that in producing this great mortality, that pe&s;tilential kind of di&s;temper was combined with the &s;curvy, which, from the places where it mo&s;t frequently occurs, hath been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>jail</HI> or <HI>ho&s;pital-fever</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. MEAD, who had &s;een the original ob&s;ervations of two of Commo|dore ANSON'S &s;urgeons, &s;ays, that the &s;curvy at that time was accompanied with <HI>putrid fevers,</HI> &amp;c. See his Treati&s;e on the Scurvy, p. 98. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. But whether the &s;curvy alone, or this fever combined with it, were the cau&s;e, it is not at pre|&s;ent material to inquire, &s;ince both, ari&s;ing from foul air and other &s;ources of putrefaction, may now in a great
<PB N="7" REF="8">mea&s;ure be obviated by the various means fallen upon &s;ince Lord ANSON'S expedition. For in ju&s;tice to that pru|dent as well as brave Commander it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the arrangements preparatory to his voyage were not made by him&s;elf; that his &s;hip was &s;o deeply laden as not to admit of opening the gun-ports, except in the calme&s;t weather, for the benefit of air; and that nothing appears to have been neglected by him, for pre&s;erving the health of his men, that was then known and practi&s;ed in the navy.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now proceed to enumerate the chief improve|ments made &s;ince that period, and which have enabled our &s;hips to make &s;o many &s;ucce&s;sful circumnavigations as in a manner to efface the impre&s;&s;ion of former di&s;a&s;|ters; but as I have mentioned the &s;ickne&s;s mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive to mariners, and again&s;t the ravages of which tho&s;e pre&s;ervatives have been mainly contrived, it may be pro|per briefly to explain its nature, and the rather as un|le&s;s among mariners it is little under&s;tood. Fir&s;t then I would ob&s;erve, that the &s;curvy is not the ailment which goes by that name on &s;hore. The di&s;temper commonly, but erroneou&s;ly in this place, called the <HI>&s;curvy</HI> belongs to a cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es totally different from what we are now treating of; and &s;o far is the commonly-received opinion, that <HI>there are few con&s;titutions altogether free from a &s;cor|butic
<PB N="8" REF="9">taint,</HI> from being true, that unle&s;s among &s;ailors and &s;ome others circum&s;tanced like them, more particularly with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who u&s;e a &s;alt and putrid diet, or live in foul air and uncleanline&s;s, I have rea&s;on to believe there are few di&s;orders le&s;s frequent. This opinion I &s;ub|mitted to the judgment of the Society &s;everal years ago, and I have had no rea&s;on &s;ince to alter it. I then &s;aid (contrary to what was generally believed) and &s;eemingly on the be&s;t authority, that the &s;ea-air was never the cau&s;e of the &s;curvy, &s;ince on board a &s;hip, on the longe&s;t voyages, cleanline&s;s, ventilation, and fre&s;h provi&s;ions, would pre&s;erve from it; and that upon a &s;ea-coa&s;t, free from mar&s;hes, the inhabitants were not liable to that indi&s;|po&s;ition, though frequently breathing the air from the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of the Army, part I. ch. 1. Append. Pap. 7.</NOTE>. I concluded with joining in &s;entiments with tho&s;e who a&s;cribed the &s;curvy to a &s;eptic re&s;olution, or begin|ning corruption, of the whole habit, &s;imilar to what every animal &s;ub&s;tance is more or le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to when deprived of life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Pap. 7.</NOTE>. This theory &s;eemed to be &s;ufficiently verified by the examination of the &s;ymptoms in the &s;corbutic &s;ick, and of the appearances in their bodies after death<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">WOODALL'S Surgeon's Mate, p. 163. POUPART, Mem. de l'Acad. R. des Sc. A. 1699. PETIT, Mal. des Os, t. II. p. 446. MEAD on the Scurvy, p. 104.</NOTE>. On
<PB N="9" REF="10">that occa&s;ion I remarked, that &s;alted meats after &s;ome time become in effect putrid, though they may continue long palatable by means of the &s;alt; and that common &s;alt, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the &s;tronged pre&s;ervatives from corruption, is at be&s;t but an indifferent one, even in a large quantity; and in a &s;mall one, &s;uch as we u&s;e at ta|ble with fre&s;h meats, or &s;wallow in meats that have been &s;alted, &s;o far from impeding putrefaction, it rather pro|motes that proce&s;s in the body.</P>
<P>This po&s;ition concerning the putrefying quality of &s;ea-&s;alt, in certain proportions, hath been &s;ince confirmed by the experiments of the late Mr. CANTON, F. R. S. in his Paper on the Cau&s;e of the luminous Appearance of Sea-water<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;act. vol. LIX. p. 446.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid, that the &s;curvy is much owing to the coldne&s;s of the air, which checks per&s;piration; and it is therefore the endemic di&s;temper of the Northern na|tions, and particularly of tho&s;e around the Baltic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BARTHOLIN. Med. Danor. Dome&s;tic. p. 98.</NOTE>. The fact is partly true, but I doubt not &s;o the cau&s;e. In tho&s;e regions, by the long and &s;evere winters, the cattle de&s;titute of pa&s;ture can barely live, and are therefore unfit for u&s;e; &s;o that the people, for their provi&s;ion during that &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="10" REF="11">are obliged to &s;laughter them by the end of autumn, and to &s;alt them for half the year. This putrid diet then, on which they mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;o long, and to which the inha|bitants of the South are not reduced, is the chief cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. And if we reflect, that the lower people of the North have few or no greens nor fruit in the win|ter, little fermented liquors, and often live in damp, foul, and ill-aired hou&s;es, it is ea&s;y to conceive how they &s;hould become liable to the &s;ame indi&s;po&s;ition with &s;eamen; whil&s;t others of as high a latitude, but who live in a different manner, keep free from it. Thus we are informed by LINNAEUS, that the Laplanders, one of the mo&s;t hyperbo|rean nations, know nothing of the &s;curvy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LINNAEI Flora Lapponica, p. 8, 9.</NOTE>; for which no other rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned than their never eating &s;alted meats, nor indeed &s;alt with any thing, but their u&s;ing all the winter the fre&s;h fle&s;h of their rain-deer.</P>
<P>This exemption of the Laplanders from the general di&s;|temper of the North is the more ob&s;ervable, as they &s;el|dom ta&s;te vegetables, bread never, as we farther learn from that celebrated author. Yet in the very provinces which border on Lapland, where they u&s;e bread, but &s;carcely any other vegetable, and eat &s;alted meats, they are as
<PB N="11" REF="12">much troubled with the &s;curvy as in any other country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LINNAEUS in &s;everal parts of his work con&s;irms what is here &s;aid of &s;alted meats, as one of the chief cau&s;es of the &s;curvy. See Amoenitat. Acad. vol. V. p. 6. &amp; &s;eq. p. 42.</NOTE>. But let us incidentally remark, that the late improvements in agriculture, gardening, and the other arts of life, by extending their influence to the remote&s;t parts of Europe, and to the lowe&s;t people, begin &s;en&s;ibly to le&s;&s;en the fre|quency of that complaint, even in tho&s;e climates that have been once the mo&s;t afflicted with it.</P>
<P>It hath al&s;o been a&s;&s;erted, that men living on &s;hore will be affected with the &s;curvy, though they have never been accu&s;tomed to a &s;alt-diet; but of this I have never known an in&s;tance, except in tho&s;e who breathed in an air that is mar&s;hy, or otherwi&s;e putrid, and who wanted exerci&s;e, fruits and green vegetables: under &s;uch circum&s;tances it mu&s;t be granted that the humours will corrupt in the &s;ame manner, though not in the &s;ame degree, with tho&s;e of ma|riners. Thus, in the late war, when Si&s;inghur&s;t Ca&s;tle in Kent was filled with French pri&s;oners, the &s;curvy broke out among them, though they had never been &s;erved with &s;alted victuals in England; but had daily had an al|lowance of fre&s;h meat, and of bread in proportion, though without greens or any other vegetable. The &s;urgeon
<PB N="12" REF="13">who attended them, and from whom I received this in|formation, having formerly been employed in the navy, was the betterable to judge of the di&s;order, and to cure it. Be&s;ides the deficiency of greens, he ob&s;erved that the wards were foul and crouded, the hou&s;e damp (from a moat that &s;urrounded it) and that the bounds allotted for taking the air were &s;o &s;mall, and in wet weather &s;o &s;loughy, that the men &s;eldom went out. He added, that a repre&s;entation having been made, he had been empowered to furni&s;h the pri&s;oners with roots and greens for boiling in their &s;oup, and to quarter the &s;ick in a neighbouring village in a dry &s;ituation, with liberty to go out for air and exerci&s;e; and that by the&s;e means they had all quickly recovered. It is probable, that the &s;curvy &s;ooner appeared among the&s;e &s;trangers, from their having all been taken at &s;ea, and con|&s;equently being the more di&s;po&s;ed to the di&s;temper. My informer farther acquainted me, that in the lower and wetter parts of that county, where &s;ome of his practice lay, he had now and then met with &s;lighter ca&s;es of the &s;curvy among the common people; &s;uch, he &s;aid, as lived the whole winter on &s;alted bacon, without fermented li|quors, greens, or any fruit, a few apples excepted; but, he remarked, that in the winters following a plentiful growth of that fruit, tho&s;e pea&s;ants were vi&s;ibly le&s;s liable to that ailment.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="14">
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this part of my &s;ubject, as I look upon the knowledge of the nature and cau&s;e of the &s;curvy to be an e&s;&s;ential &s;tep towards improving the means of prevention and cure. And I am per&s;uaded, after long reflection, and the opportunities I have had of conver&s;ing with tho&s;e who to much &s;agacity had joined no &s;mall experience in nautical practice, that upon an examination of the &s;everal articles, which have either been of old approven, or have of late been introduced in|to the navy, it will appear, that though the&s;e means may vary in form and in their mode of operating; yet they all &s;ome way contribute towards preventing <HI>putrefaction;</HI> whether of the air in the clo&s;er parts of a &s;hip, of the meats, of the water, of the clothes and bedding, or of the body it&s;elf. And if in this inquiry (which may be made by the way, whil&s;t we take a review of the principal arti|cles of provi&s;ion, and other means u&s;ed by Captain COOK to guard again&s;t &s;ickne&s;s) I &s;ay, if in this inquiry it &s;hall appear, that the notion of a &s;eptic cau&s;e is not without foundation, it will be no &s;mall encouragement to proceed on that principle, in order to improve this important branch of medicine.</P>
<P>Captain COOK begins his li&s;t of &s;tores with <HI>malt: Of this,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>was made &s;weet-wort, and given not only to
<PB N="14" REF="15">tho&s;e men who had manife&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;curvy, but to &s;uch al&s;o as were judged to be the mo&s;t liable to it.</HI> Dr. MACBRIDE, who fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted this preparation, was led (as he &s;ays) to the di&s;covery by &s;ome experiments that had been laid before this Society; by which it appeared, that the air produced by alimentary fermentation was endowed with a power of correcting putrefaction. The fact he confirmed by numerous trials, and finding this fluid to be <HI>fixed air,</HI> he ju&s;tly concluded, that whatever &s;ub&s;tance proper for food abounded with it, and which could be conveniently carried to &s;ea, would make one of the be&s;t provi&s;ions again&s;t the &s;curvy; which he then con&s;i|dered as a putrid di&s;ea&s;e, and as &s;uch to be prevented or cured by that powerful kind of anti&s;eptic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MACBRIDE's Experimental E&s;&s;ays, <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI></NOTE>. Beer, for in&s;tance, hath always been e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t anti&s;corbutics; but as that derived all its <HI>fixed air</HI> from the malt of which it is made, he inferred, that malt it&s;elf was preferable in long voyages, as it took up le&s;s room than the brewed liquor, and would keep longer &s;ound. Experience hath &s;ince veri&s;ied this ingenious theory, and the malt hath now gained &s;o much credit in the navy, that there only wanted &s;o long, &s;o healthful, and &s;o celebrated a voyage as this, to rank it among the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able articles of provi&s;ion. For though Captain COOK remarks, that <HI>A

<P>In wine it abounds, and perhaps no vegetable &s;ub|&s;tance is more replete with it than the fruit of the vine. If we join the grateful ta&s;te of wine, we mu&s;t rank it fir&s;t in the li&s;t of anti&s;corbutic liquors. Cyder is likewi&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="17">good, with other vinous productions from fruit, as al&s;o the various kinds of beer. It hath been a con&s;tant ob&s;er|vation, that in long cruizes or di&s;tant voyages the &s;curvy is never &s;een whil&s;t the &s;mall-beer holds out at a full allowance; but that when it is all expended, the di&s;order &s;oon appears. It were therefore to be wi&s;hed, that this mo&s;t whole&s;ome beverage could be renewed at &s;ea; but our &s;hips afford not &s;ufficient convenience. The Ru&s;&s;ians however make a &s;hift to prepare at &s;ea, as well as at land, a liquor of a middle quality between wort and &s;mall-beer, in the following manner. They take ground malt and rye-meal in a certain proportion, which they knead into &s;mall loaves, and bake in the oven. The&s;e they occa|&s;ionally infu&s;e in a proper quantity of warm water, which begins &s;o &s;oon to ferment, that in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours their brewage is compleated, in the production of a &s;mall, bri&s;k, and acidulous liquor, which they call <HI>quas,</HI> palatable to them&s;elves and not di&s;agreeable to the ta&s;te of &s;trangers. The late Dr. MOUNSEY, member of this Society, who had lived long in Ru&s;&s;ia, and had been <HI>Archiater</HI> under two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns, acquainted me that the <HI>quas</HI> was the common and whole&s;ome drink both of the fleets and armies of that empire, and that it was particularly good again&s;t the &s;curvy. He added,
<PB N="17" REF="18">that happening to be at Mo&s;cow when he peru&s;ed the <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the Jail-Fever,</HI> publi&s;hed here, he had been induced to compare what he read in that treati&s;e with what he &s;hould &s;ee in the &s;everal pri&s;ons of that large city: but to his &s;urprize, after vi&s;iting them all, and find|ing them full of malefactors (for the late Empre&s;s then &s;uffered none of tho&s;e who were convicted of capital crimes to be put to death) yet he could di&s;cover no fever among them, nor learn that any acute di&s;temper peculiar to jails had ever been known there. He ob&s;erved that &s;ome of tho&s;e places of confinement had a yard, into which the pri&s;o|ners were allowed to come for the air; but that there were others without this advantage, yet not &s;ickly: &s;o that he could a&s;&s;ign no other rea&s;on for the healthful condition of tho&s;e men than the kind of diet they u&s;ed; which was the &s;ame with that of the common people of the country, who not being able to purcha&s;e fle&s;h-meat live mo&s;tly on rye-bread (the mo&s;t ace&s;cent of any bread) and drink <HI>quas.</HI> He concluded with &s;aying, that upon his return to St. Pe|ter&s;burg he had made the &s;ame enquiry there, and with the &s;ame re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Thus far my informer, from who&s;e account it would appear, that the rye-meal a&s;&s;i&s;ted both in quickening the fermentation and adding more &s;ixed air; &s;ince the malt
<PB N="18" REF="19">alone could not &s;o readily produce &s;o acidulous and bri&s;k a liquor. And there is little doubt but that whenever the other grains can be brought to a proper degree of fer|mentation, they will more or le&s;s in the &s;ame way become u&s;eful. That oats will, I am &s;atisfied, from what I have been told by one of the intelligent friends of Captain COOK. This gentlemen being on a cruize in a large &s;hip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The E&s;&s;ex, a &s;eventy-gun &s;hip.</NOTE>, in the beginning of the late war, and the &s;curvy breaking out among his crew, he bethought him&s;elf of a kind of food, he had &s;een u&s;ed in &s;ome parts of the country, as the mo&s;t proper on this occa&s;ion. Some oatmeal is put into a wooden ve&s;&s;el, hot water is poured upon it, and the infu|&s;ion continues until the liquor begins to ta&s;te &s;ouri&s;h, that is, till a fermentation comes on, which in a place moderately warm may be in the &s;pace of two days. The water is then poured off from the grounds, and boiled down to the con|&s;i&s;tence of a jelly<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This rural food, in the North, is called <HI>&s;ooins.</HI></NOTE>. This he ordered to be made, and dealt out in me&s;&s;es, being fir&s;t &s;weetened with &s;ugar, and &s;ea&s;oned with &s;ome prize-wine he had taken, which though turned &s;our, yet improved the ta&s;te, and made this aliment no le&s;s palatable than medicinal.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured me, that upon this diet chiefly, and by ab&s;taining from &s;alted meats, his <HI>&s;corbutic</HI> &s;ick quite re|covered
<PB N="19" REF="20">on board; and not in that voyage only, but by the &s;ame means in his &s;ub&s;equent cruizes, during the war, without his being once obliged to &s;end one of them on &s;hore becau&s;e they could not get well at &s;ea. Yet oat|meal unfermented, like barley unmalted, hath no &s;en&s;i|ble effect in curing the &s;curvy; as if the <HI>fixed air,</HI> which is incorporated with the&s;e grains, could mix with the chyle which they produce, enter the lacteals, and make part of the nouri&s;hment of the body, without manife&s;ting any ela&s;tic or anti&s;eptic quality, when not loo&s;ened by a previous fermentation.</P>
<P>Before the power of the <HI>fixed air</HI> in &s;ubduing pu|trefaction was known, the efficacy of fruits, greens, and fermented liquors, was commonly a&s;cribed to the acid in their compo&s;ition, and we have &s;till rea&s;on to believe that the acid concurs in operating the effect. If it be alledged that mineral acids, which contain little or no <HI>fixed air,</HI> have been tried in the &s;curvy with little &s;ucce&s;s, I would an&s;wer, that I doubt that in tho&s;e trials they have never been &s;ufficiently diluted; for it is ea&s;y to conceive, that in the &s;mall quantity of water the elixir of vitriol, for in&s;tance, is given, that au&s;tere acid can &s;carce get beyond the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, con&s;idering the deli|cate &s;en&s;ibility of the mouths of the lacteals, which mu&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="21">force them to &s;hut and exclude &s;o pungent a liquor. It were therefore a proper experiment to be made in a deficiency of malt, or when that grain &s;hould happen to be &s;poilt by keeping<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain COOK told me, that the malt held out &s;ufficiently good for the two fir&s;t years; but that in the third, having lo&s;t much of its ta&s;te, he doubted whe|ther it retained any of its virtues. Mr. PATTEN however ob&s;erved, that though the malt at that time was &s;en&s;ibly decayed, yet neverthele&s;s he had &s;till &s;ound it u&s;eful, when he employed a larger proportion of it to make the infu&s;ion.</NOTE>, to u&s;e water acidulated with the &s;pirit of &s;ea-&s;alt, in the proportion of only ten drops to a quart; or with the weak &s;pirit of vitriol, thirteen drops to the &s;ame mea&s;ure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the&s;e proportions I found the water ju&s;t acidulous and plea&s;ant.</NOTE>; and to give to tho&s;e that are threatened with the di&s;ea&s;e three quarts of this liquor in the day, to be con&s;umed as they &s;hall think proper.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>fixed air</HI> and acids are &s;uch pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the &s;curvy, why &s;hould Captain COOK make &s;o little account of the <HI>rob</HI> of lemons and of oranges (for &s;o they have called the extracts or in&s;pi&s;&s;ated juices of tho&s;e fruits) in treating that di&s;temper? This I found was the rea&s;on. The&s;e preparations being only &s;ent out upon trial, the &s;urgeon of the &s;hip was told, at a conjecture, how much he might give for a do&s;e, but without &s;trictly limiting it. The experiment was made with the quantity &s;pecified, but with &s;o little advantage, that judging it not advi&s;eable to lo&s;e more time, he &s;et about the cure with the wort only,
<PB N="21" REF="22">whereof the efficacy he was certain; whil&s;t he re&s;erved the&s;e <HI>robs</HI> for other purpo&s;es, more particularly for colds, when to a large draught of warm water, with &s;ome &s;pirits and &s;ugar, he added a &s;poonful of one of them, and with this compo&s;ition made a grateful &s;udorific which an&s;wered the intention. No wonder then if Captain COOK, not knowing the proper do&s;e of the&s;e concentrated juices for the &s;curvy, but &s;eeing them fail as they were given in the trial, &s;hould entertain no great opinion of their anti&s;cor|butic powers. It may be al&s;o proper to take notice, that as they had been reduced to a &s;mall proportion of their bulk by evaporation upon fire, it is probable, they were much weakened by that proce&s;s, and that with their aqueous parts they had lo&s;t not a little of their a&euml;rial, on which &s;o much of their anti&s;eptic virtue de|pended. If therefore a farther trial of the&s;e excellent fruits were to be made, it would &s;eem more advi&s;able to &s;end to &s;ea the purified juices entire in ca&s;ks, agreeably to a propo&s;al I find hath been made to the Admiralty by an ingenious and experienced navy-&s;urgeon &s;ome years ago. For in truth, the te&s;timonies in favour of the &s;alutary qua|lities of the&s;e acids are &s;o numerous and &s;o &s;trong, that I &s;hould look upon &s;ome failures, even in ca&s;es where their want of &s;ucce&s;s cannot &s;o well be accounted for as in this
<PB N="22" REF="23">voyage, not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for &s;triking them out of the li&s;t of the mo&s;t powerful pre&s;ervatives again&s;t this con|&s;uming malady of &s;ailors.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that Captain COOK &s;ays not more in prai&s;e of vinegar than of the <HI>robs;</HI> yet I would not thence infer, that he made no account of that acid; but only, that as he happened in this voyage to be &s;paringly provided with it, and yet did well, he could not con|&s;ider a large &s;tore of it to be &s;o material an article of pro|vi&s;ion as was commonly imagined. And though he &s;up|plied its place in the me&s;&s;es of the men with the acid of the <HI>&s;our-krout,</HI> and tru&s;ted chiefly to fire for purifying his decks, yet it is to be hoped that future navigators will not therefore omit it. Vinegar will &s;erve at lea&s;t for a whole&s;ome variety in the &s;ea&s;oning of the &s;alted meats, and may be &s;ometimes &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed as a medicine, e&s;pecially in the a&s;per&s;ions of the berths of the &s;ick. It is ob&s;ervable that though the &s;mell be little grateful to a per|&s;on in health, yet it is commonly agreeable to tho&s;e who are &s;ick, and particularly to &s;uch as are confined to a foul and crouded ward. There the phy&s;ician will &s;mell to vinegar, as much for plea&s;ure as for guarding again&s;t infection.</P>
<P>Now the wort and the acid juices were only di&s;pen&s;ed as medicines, but the next article was of more exten&s;ive u&s;e.
<PB N="23" REF="24">This was the <HI>&s;our-krout</HI> (&s;our cabbage) a di&s;h of univer|&s;al reque&s;t in Germany. The acidity is acquired by its &s;pontaneous fermentation, and it was the &s;our ta&s;te which made it the more acceptable to all who ate it. To its farther commendation we may add, that it held out good to the la&s;t of the voyage.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange, that though this herb hath had &s;uch high encomiums be&s;towed upon it by the ancients (witne&s;s what CATO the elder and PLINY the naturali&s;t &s;ay on the &s;ubject) and hath had the &s;anction of the expe|rience of nations for ages in its favour, it &s;hould yet be di&s;approved of by &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed writers of our times. One finds it yield a rank &s;mell in decoc|tion, which he confounds with that of putrefaction. Another analyzes it, and di&s;covers &s;o much gro&s;s air in the compo&s;ition as to render it indige&s;tible; yet this flatulence, &s;o much decryed, mu&s;t now be acknowledged to be the <HI>fixed air,</HI> which makes the cabbage &s;o whole&s;ome when fermented. Nay it hath been traduced by one of the mo&s;t celebrated phy&s;icians of our age, as partaking of a poi&s;onous nature: and little better founded was that po&s;i|tion of the &s;ame illu&s;trious author, that cabbage being an alcale&s;cent plant, and therefore di&s;po&s;ing to putre|faction, could never be u&s;ed in the &s;curvy, except when
<PB N="24" REF="25">the di&s;ea&s;e proceeded from an acid. But the experiments which I formerly laid before the Society evinced this ve|getable, with the re&s;t of the &s;uppo&s;ed alcale&s;cents, to be really ace&s;cent; and that the &s;curvy never is owing to acidity, but, much otherwi&s;e, to a &s;pecies of putrefaction, that very cau&s;e of which the ill-grounded cla&s;s of alca|le&s;cents was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a promoter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this remark more at large, Di&s;. of the Army, App. Pap. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among other of the late improvements of the naval &s;tores we have heard much of the <HI>portable-&s;oup,</HI> and ac|cordingly we find that Captain Cook hath not a little availed him&s;elf of it in his voyage. This concentrated broth being freed from all fat, and having by long boil|ing evaporated the mo&s;t putre&s;cent parts of the meat, is reduced to the con&s;i&s;tence of a glue, which in effect it is, and will like other glues, in a dry place, keep &s;ound for years together. It hath been &s;aid, that broths turn &s;our on keeping, though made without any vegetable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">La &s;eule matiere qui s'aigri&s;&s;e dans le &s;ang e&s;t la matiere gelatineu&s;e, &amp;c. SENAC, Structure du Coeur, l. iii. ch. 4. &sect; 5.</NOTE>. Now whether any real acid be thus formed may be a que&s;tion: I incline at lea&s;t to believe, that the gelatinous parts of animal &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as compo&s;e the&s;e cakes, are not of a nature much di&s;po&s;ed to putrefy. But however that may be, &s;ince Captain COOK ob&s;erves, that this
<PB N="25" REF="26">&s;oup was the means of making his people eat a greater quantity of greens than they would have done otherwi&s;e, in &s;o far we mu&s;t allow it to have been virtually anti&s;eptic.</P>
<P>So much for tho&s;e articles that have of late been &s;up|plied to all the king's &s;hips on long voyages, and in which therefore our worthy brother claims no other merit than the prudent di&s;pen&s;ation of them; but what follows, being regulations either wholly new, or improven hints from &s;ome of his experienced friends, he may ju&s;tly ap|propriate to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, he put his people at three watches in&s;tead of two (which is the general practice at &s;ea) that is, he divided the whole crew into three companies, and by putting each company upon the watch by turns, four hours at a time, every man had eight hours free, for four of duty; whereas at watch and watch the half of the men being upon duty at once, with returns of it every four hours, they can have but broken &s;leeps, and when expo&s;ed to wet they have not time to get dry before they lie down. When the &s;ervice requires it, &s;uch hard&s;hips mu&s;t be endured; but when there is no pre&s;&s;ing call, ought not a mariner to be refre&s;hed with as much uninterrupted re&s;t as a common day-labourer?</P>
<PB N="26" REF="27">
<P>I am well informed that an officer di&s;tingui&s;hes him|&s;elf in nothing more than in pre&s;erving his men from wet and the other injuries of the weather. The&s;e were mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points with this humane commander. In the torrid zone he &s;haded his people from the &s;corching &s;un by an awning over his deck; and in his cour&s;e under the antarctic circle he had a coat provided for each man, of a &s;ub&s;tantial woollen &s;tuff, with the addition of a hood for covering their heads. This garb (which the &s;ailors called their <HI>Magellan jacket</HI>) they occa&s;ionally wore, and found it a mo&s;t comfortable one for working in rain and &s;now, and among the broken ice in the high latitudes of the South.</P>
<P>Let us proceed to another article not le&s;s material; which is the care to keep clean the per&s;ons, bedding, and cloaths of the &s;ailors. The Captain acquainted me, that re|gularly one morning in the week he pa&s;&s;ed his &s;hip's com|pany in review, and &s;aw that every man had changed his linen, and was in other re&s;pects as clean and neat as circum|&s;tances would permit. It is well known how much <HI>cleanli|ne&s;s</HI> is conducive to health; but it is not &s;o obvious how much it al&s;o tends to good order and other virtues. That diligent officer was per&s;uaded (nor was perhaps the ob&s;ervation new) that &s;uch men as he could induce to be more cleanly
<PB N="27" REF="28">than they were di&s;po&s;ed to be of them&s;elves, became at the &s;ame time more &s;ober, more orderly, and more attentive to their duty. It mu&s;t be acknowledged that a &s;eaman has but indifferent means to keep him&s;elf clean, had he the greate&s;t inclination to do it; for I have not heard that the commanders of &s;hips have yet availed them&s;elves of the <HI>&s;till</HI> for providing fre&s;h water for wa&s;hing; and it is well known that &s;ea-water doth not mix with &s;oap, and that linen wet with brine never thoroughly dries. But for Cap|tain COOK, the frequent opportunities he had of taking in water among the i&s;lands of the South-Sea, enabled him in that tract to di&s;pen&s;e to his &s;hip's company fre&s;h water for every u&s;e; and when he navigated in the high lati|tudes of the Southern Oceans, he &s;till more abundantly provided them with it, as I &s;hall take notice in the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the hammocks and bedding I need &s;ay little, as all officers are now &s;en&s;ible how much it concerns the health of their people to have this part of a &s;hip's furniture kept dry and well-aired; &s;ince by the per&s;piration of &s;o many men, every thing below, even in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, is apt to contract an offen&s;ive moi&s;ture. But Cap|tain COOK was not &s;atisfied with ordering upon deck the hammocks and bedding every day that was fair (the com|mon
<PB N="28" REF="29">method) but took care that each bundle &s;hould be unla&s;hed, and &s;o &s;pread out that every part of it might be expo&s;ed to the air.</P>
<P>His next concern was to &s;ee to the purity of the &s;hip it&s;elf; without which attention all the re&s;t would have profited little. I &s;hall not however detain you with his orders about wa&s;hing and &s;craping his decks, as I do not under&s;tand that in that kind of clean&s;ing he excelled others; but &s;ince he has laid &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s upon <HI>fire</HI> as a purifier, I &s;hall endeavour to explain his way of u&s;ing it, more fully than he has done in his Paper. Some wood being put into a proper &s;tove or grate is lighted, and car|ried &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to every part below deck. Wherever fire is, the air neare&s;t to it being heated becomes &s;pecifically lighter, and by being lighter ri&s;es and pa&s;&s;es through the hatchways into the atmo&s;phere. The vacant &s;pace is filled with the cold air around, and that being heated in its turn, in like manner a&s;cends and is re-placed by other air as before. Thus by continuing the fire for &s;ome time in any of the lower apartments, the foul air is in a mea|&s;ure driven out, and the fre&s;h admitted. This is not all: I apprehend that the acid &s;teams of the wood, in burning, act here as an anti&s;eptic on the corrupted air that remains.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="30">
<P>An officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, another of Captain COOK'S experienced friends, mentioned to me a common and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation in the fleet; which was, that all the old twenty-gun &s;hips were remarkably le&s;s &s;ickly than tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;ize of a modern con&s;truction. This, he &s;aid, was a circum&s;tance he could not otherwi&s;e ac|count for, than that, by the former having their <HI>galley</HI> [their kitchen] in the fore-part of the orlop, the chimney vented &s;o ill, that it was &s;ure to fill every part with &s;moke whenever the wind was a-&s;tern: this was a nui&s;ance for the time, but, as he thought, abundantly compen&s;ated by the extraordinary good health of the &s;everal crews. Po&s;|&s;ibly the heat of tho&s;e fire-places was al&s;o beneficial, by drying and ventilating tho&s;e &s;hips more when they were below, than they can do now they are placed upon the upper deck under the fore-ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t obvious u&s;e of the portable fires was their drying up the moi&s;ture, and e&s;pecially in tho&s;e places where there was the lea&s;t circulation of air. This hu|midity, compo&s;ed of the per&s;pirable matter of a multi|tude of men, and often of animals (kept for a live-&s;tock) and of the &s;teams of the bilge-water from the well, where the corruption is the greate&s;t; this moi&s;ture, I &s;ay, being
<PB N="30" REF="31">one of the main &s;ources of &s;ea-di&s;ea&s;es, was therefore more particularly attended to, in order to its removal. The fires were the powerful in&s;trument for that purpo&s;e; and whil&s;t they burnt, &s;ome men were employed in rubbing hard, with can va&s;s or oakum, every part of the in&s;ide of the &s;hip that was damp and acce&s;&s;ible. But the advantage of fire appears no where &s;o manife&s;t as in clean&s;ing the well; for this being in the lowe&s;t part of the hold, the whole leakage runs into it, whether of the &s;hip it&s;elf, or of the ca&s;ks of &s;poilt meats or corrupted water. The mephitic vapours from this &s;ink alone have often been the cau&s;e of in&s;tantaneous death to tho&s;e who have unwarily ap|proached to clean it; and not to one only, but to &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, when they have gone down to &s;uccour their unfortunate companions: yet this very place has not only been rendered &s;afe but &s;weet, by means of an iron pot filled with fire and let down to burn in it.</P>
<P>When from the circum&s;tances of the weather this &s;a|lutary operation could not take place, the &s;hip was fumi|gated with gun-powder, as de&s;cribed in the Paper; though that &s;moke could have no effect in drying, but only in cor|recting the corruption of the air, by means of the acid &s;pirits from the &s;ulphur and nitre, aided perhaps by &s;ome &s;pecies of an a&euml;rial fluid, then di&s;engaged from them, to

<P>Among the &s;everal means of &s;weetening or renewing the air, we &s;hould expect to hear of Dr. HALES'S <HI>ventila|tor.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was my expectation; and therefore, per&s;uaded as I was of the excellence of the invention, it was not without much regret that I &s;aw &s;o good an oppor|tunity lo&s;t of giving the &s;ame favourable impre&s;&s;ion of it to the public. If a degree of &s;ucce&s;s, exceeding our mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, is not &s;ufficient for ju&s;tifying the omi&s;|&s;ion of a mea&s;ure, deemed to be one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential for attaining an end, I would plead in favour of our wor|thy brother, that by a humiliating fatality, &s;o often ac|companying the mo&s;t u&s;eful di&s;coveries, the credit of this ventilator is yet far from being firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the navy. What wonder then if Captain COOK, being &s;o much otherwi&s;e taken up, &s;hould not have had time to examine it, and therefore avoided the encumbering of his &s;hip with an <HI>apparatus</HI> he had po&s;&s;ibly never &s;een u&s;ed, and of which he had at be&s;t received but a doubtful cha|racter? Nor was he altogether unprovided with a ma|chine for ventilation. He had the <HI>wind-&s;ails,</HI> though he
<PB N="32" REF="33">hath not mentioned them in his Paper; and he told me, that he had found them at times mo&s;t &s;erviceable, and particularly between the Tropics. They have the merit of taking up little room, they require no labour in work|ing, and the contrivance is &s;o &s;imple that they can fail in no hands: but their powers are &s;mall, in compari&s;on with tho&s;e of the ventilator; they cannot be put up in hard gales of wind, and they are of no efficacy in dead calms, when a refre&s;hment of the air is mo&s;t wanted. Should there be any objection to the employing both?</P>
<P>Such were the mea&s;ures taken by our &s;agacious navi|gator for procuring a purity of air. It remains only to &s;ee in what manner he &s;upplied pure water; another article of &s;o great moment, that the thir&s;ty voyager, upon his &s;alt and putrid diet, with a &s;hort allowance of this element, and that in a corrupted &s;tate, mu&s;t account a plentiful provi&s;ion of fre&s;h and &s;weet water to be indeed <HI>the be&s;t of things.</HI></P>
<P>Captain COOK was not without an <HI>apparatus</HI> for di&s;tilling &s;ea-water; and though he could not obtain nearly &s;o much as was expected from the invention, yet he &s;ometimes availed him&s;elf of it; but for the mo&s;t of his voyage he was otherwi&s;e provided. Within the Southern Tropic, in the Pacific Ocean, he found &s;o many i&s;lands, and tho&s;e &s;o well &s;tored with
<PB N="33" REF="34">&s;prings, that as I have hinted before he never was without a &s;ufficiency of water for every nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e. But not &s;atisfied with plenty, he would have the &s;weete&s;t; and therefore, whenever an opportunity offered, he emptied what he had taken in but a few days before, and filled his ca&s;ks anew. But was he not above four months in his pa&s;&s;age from the Cape of Good-Hope to New-Zee|land, in the frozen zone of the South, without once &s;ee|ing land? and did he not actually complete his circum|navigation, in that high latitude, without the benefit of a &s;ingle fountain? Here was indeed <HI>a wonder of the deep!</HI> I may call it the romance of his voyage! Tho&s;e very &s;hoals, fields, and floating mountains of ice, among which he &s;teered his perilous cour&s;e, and which pre&s;ented &s;uch terrifying pro&s;pects of de&s;truction; tho&s;e, I &s;ay, were the very means of his &s;upport, by &s;upplying him abundantly with what he mo&s;t wanted. It had been &s;aid that tho&s;e &s;tupendous ma&s;&s;es of ice, called <HI>mountains,</HI> melted into fre&s;h water; though CRANTZ, the relator of that para|dox, doth not imagine they originate from the &s;ea; but that they are fir&s;t formed in the great rivers of the North, and being carried down into the occan are after|wards increa&s;ed to that enormous height by the &s;now that falls upon them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of Greenland, b. I. ch. ii. &sect; 11, 12.</NOTE>. But that all frozen &s;ea-water would
<PB N="34" REF="35">thaw into fre&s;h, had either never been a&s;&s;erted, or had met with little credit. This is certain, that Captain COOK expected no &s;uch tran&s;mutation, and therefore was agree|ably &s;urprized to find he had one difficulty le&s;s to en|counter; that of pre&s;erving the health of his men &s;o long on &s;alt provi&s;ions, with a &s;canty allowance of corrupted water, or what he could procure by di&s;tillation. The melted ice of the &s;ea was not only &s;weet but &s;oft, and &s;o whole&s;ome as to &s;hew, among numerous other in&s;tances, the fallacy of human rea&s;on un&s;upported by experiments: an ancient of great authority had a&s;&s;igned, from theory, bad qualities to melted &s;now; and from that period to the pre&s;ent times, this prejudice had not been quite removed.</P>
<P>In this circumnavigation, amid&s;t &s;leets and falls of &s;now, fogs, and much moi&s;t weather, the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> enjoyed the &s;ame good &s;tate of health &s;he had done in the temperate and torrid zones. It appears only from the journal of the &s;urgeon, that towards the end of the fir&s;t cour&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Viz.</HI> the voyage between the Cape of Good-Hope and New-Zeeland.</NOTE> &s;ome of the crew began to complain of the &s;curvy; but the di&s;ea&s;e made little progre&s;s, except in one who had be|come early an invalid from another cau&s;e. The other di&s;orders were likewi&s;e incon&s;iderable, &s;uch as common colds, &s;light diarrhoeas, and intermittents, as they readily
<PB N="35" REF="36">yielded to the bark: there were al&s;o a few fevers of a con|tinued form, but which by timely care never ro&s;e to an alarming height. Much commendation is therefore due to the attention and abilities of Mr. PATTEN, the &s;urgeon of the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> for having &s;o well &s;econded his Captain in the di&s;charge of his duty. For it mu&s;t be allowed, that in de&s;pite of the be&s;t regulations and the be&s;t provi|&s;ions, there will always be among a numerous crew, during a long voyage, &s;ome ca&s;ualties more or le&s;s productive of &s;ickne&s;s; and that unle&s;s there be an intelligent medical a&s;&s;i&s;tant on board, many under the wi&s;e&s;t commander will peri&s;h that otherwi&s;e might have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>THESE, GENTLEMEN, are the reflections I had to lay before you on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject; and if I have en|croached on your time, you will recollect that much of my di&s;cour&s;e hath been employed in explaining &s;ome things but ju&s;t mentioned by Captain COOK, and in adding the materials which I had procured partly from him&s;elf, and partly, &s;ince his departure, from tho&s;e intel|ligent friends he alludes to in his Paper. This was my plan; which if I have executed to your &s;ati&s;|faction,
<PB N="36" REF="37">your thanks are due to tho&s;e gentlemen who, on your account, &s;o cheerfully communicated to me their ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>As to your acknowledgments to Captain COOK, and your high opinion of his de&s;erts, you now te&s;tify them by the honourable di&s;tinction &s;ugge&s;ted to you by your Council, in pre&s;enting him with this medal: for I need not gather your &s;uffrages, &s;ince the attention with which you have favoured me hath abundantly expre&s;&s;ed your approbation. My &s;atisfaction therefore had been com|plete, had he him&s;elf been pre&s;ent to receive the honours you now confer upon him. But you are apprized that our brave and indefatigable Brother is at this in&s;tant far di&s;tant from us; anticipating, I may &s;ay, your wonted re|que&s;t on the&s;e occa&s;ions, by continuing his labours, for the advancement of Natural Knowledge, and for the ho|nour of this Society; &s;ince you may be a&s;&s;ured, that the object of his new enterprize is not le&s;s great; perhaps &s;till greater than either of the former.</P>
<P>Allow me then, GENTLEMEN, to deliver this medal, with his unperi&s;hing name engraven upon it, into the hands of one who will be happy to receive that tru&s;t, and to know that this re&s;pectable Body never more cordially
<PB N="37" REF="38">nor more meritoriou&s;ly be&s;towed that faithful &s;ymbol of their e&s;teem and affection. For if Rome decreed the <HI>civic crown</HI> to him who &s;aved the life of a &s;ingle citizen; what wreaths are due to that Man, who, having him&s;elf &s;aved many, perpetuates now in your Tran&s;actions the means by which Britain may henceforth pre&s;erve num|bers of her intrepid &s;ons, her <HI>Mariners;</HI> who, braving every danger, have &s;o liberally contributed to the fame, to the opulence, and to the maritime empire, of their Country!</P>

<HEAD>The Method taken for pre&s;erving the Health of the Crew of His Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> during her late Voyage round the World.</HEAD>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Mile-end, <DATE>March 5, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS many gentlemen have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize at the uncommon good &s;tate of health which the crew of the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> under my command, experienced during her late voyage; I take the liberty to communi|cate to you the methods that were taken to obtain that end. Much was owing to the extraordinary attention given by the Admiralty, in cau&s;ing &s;uch articles to be put on board, as either by experience or conjecture were judged to tend mo&s;t to pre&s;erve the health of &s;eamen. I &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s upon your time in mentioning all tho&s;e articles, but con&s;ine my&s;elf to &s;uch as were found the mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="40">
<P>We had on board a large quantity of Malt, of which was made &s;weet-wort, and given (not only to tho&s;e men who had manife&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;curvy, but to &s;uch al&s;o as were, from circum&s;tances, judged to be mo&s;t liable to that di&s;order) from one or two or three pints in the day to each man, or in &s;uch proportion as the &s;urgeon thought nece&s;&s;ary; which &s;ometimes amounted to three quarts in the twenty-four hours. This is without doubt one of the be&s;t anti&s;corbutic &s;ea-medicines yet found out; and if given in time will, with proper attention to other things, I am per&s;uaded, prevent the &s;curvy from making any great progre&s;s for a con&s;iderable time: but I am not altogether of opinion, that it will cure it in an advanced &s;tate at &s;ea.</P>
<P>Sour-Krout, of which we had al&s;o a large provi&s;ion, is not only a whole&s;ome vegetable food, but, in my judg|ment, highly anti&s;corbutic, and &s;poils not by keeping. A pound of it was &s;erved to each man, when at &s;ea, twice a week, or oftener when it was thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Portable-Soup, or broth, was another e&s;&s;ential article, of which we had likewi&s;e a liberal &s;upply. An ounce of this to each man, or &s;uch other proportion as was thought nece&s;&s;ary, was boiled with their pea&s;e three days in the week; and when we were in places where fre&s;h vegetables could be procured, it was boiled, with them and with wheat
<PB N="41" REF="41">or oatmeal, every morning for breakfa&s;t, and al&s;o with dried pea&s;e and fre&s;h vegetables for dinner. It enabled us to make &s;everal nouri&s;hing and whole&s;ome me&s;&s;es, and was the means of making the people eat a greater quan|tity of greens than they would have done otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Further, we were provided with Rob of lemons and oranges; which the &s;urgeon found u&s;eful in &s;everal ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other articles of victualling we were fur|ni&s;hed with &s;ugar in the room of oil, and with wheat in|&s;tead of much oatmeal, and were certainly gainers by the exchange. Sugar, I imagine, is a very good anti&s;corbutic; whereas oil, &s;uch at lea&s;t as is u&s;ually given to the navy, I apprehend has the contrary effect. But the introduction of the mo&s;t &s;alutary articles, either as provi&s;ion or medi|cines, will generally prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, unle&s;s &s;upported by certain rules of living.</P>
<P>On this principle, many years experience, together with &s;ome hints I had from Sir HUGH PALLISER, the Captains CAMPBELL, WALLIS, and other intelligent officers, ena|bled me to lay down a plan whereby all was to be con|ducted. The crew were at three watches, except upon &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions. By this means they were
<PB N="42" REF="42">not &s;o much expo&s;ed to the weather as if they had been at watch and watch; and they had generally dry cloaths to &s;hift them&s;elves when they happened to get wet. Care was al&s;o taken to expo&s;e them as little as po&s;&s;ible. Proper methods were employed to keep their per&s;ons, hammocks, bedding, cloaths, &amp;c. con&s;tantly clean and dry. Equal pains were taken to keep the &s;hip clean and dry between decks. Once or twice a week &s;he was aired with fires; and when this could not be done, &s;he was &s;moaked with gunpowder moi&s;tened with vinegar or wa|ter. I had al&s;o frequently a fire made in an iron pot at the bottom of the well, which greatly purified the air in the lower parts of the &s;hip. To this and cleanline&s;s, as well in the &s;hip as among&s;t the people, too great attention cannot be paid; the lea&s;t neglect occa&s;ions a putrid of|fen&s;ive &s;mell below, which nothing but fires will re|move; and if the&s;e be not u&s;ed in time, tho&s;e &s;mells will be attended with bad con&s;equences. Proper care was taken of the &s;hip's coppers, &s;o that they were kept con&s;tantly clean. The fat, which boiled out of the &s;alt beef and pork, I never &s;uffered to be given to the people, as is cu&s;tomary; being of opinion that it promotes the &s;curvy. I never failed to take in water wherever it was to be procured, even when we did not &s;eem to want it;
<PB N="43" REF="43">becau&s;e I look upon fre&s;h water from the &s;hore to be much more whole&s;ome than that which has been kept &s;ome time on board. Of this e&s;&s;ential article we were never at an al|lowance, but had always abundance for every nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e. I am convinced that with plenty of fre&s;h water, and a clo&s;e attention to cleanline&s;s, a &s;hip's company will &s;eldom be much afflicted with the &s;curvy, though they &s;hould not be provided with any of the anti&s;corbutics be|fore mentioned. We came to few places where either the art of man or nature did not afford &s;ome &s;ort of refre&s;hment or other, either of the animal or vegetable kind. It was my fir&s;t care to procure what could be met with of either by every means in my power, and to oblige our people to make u&s;e thereof, both by my example and authority; but the benefits ari&s;ing from &s;uch refre&s;hments &s;oon became &s;o obvious, that I had little occa&s;ion to employ either the one or the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e, SIR, were the methods, under the care of Provi|dence, by which the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> performed a voyage of three years and eighteen days, through all the climates from 52^o North to 71^o South, with the lo&s;s of one man only by di&s;ea&s;e, and who died of a complicated and lin|gering illne&s;s, without any mixture of &s;curvy. Two
<PB N="44" REF="44">others were unfortunately drowned, and one killed by fall; &s;o that of the whole number with which I &s;et o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from England I lo&s;t only four.</P>
