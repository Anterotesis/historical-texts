<HEAD>[<HI>February</HI> 18. 1737.]</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MEMORIAL concerning the SURGEONS HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>_WE the SURGEON-APOTHECA|RIES in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Erectors of the <HI>Surgeons Ho&s;pital</HI> there, having lately &s;et up and brought to &s;ome Bearing this new Ho&s;pital, do think it our Duty to publi&s;h this &s;hort Account of our Proceedings, before we call in the Money &s;ub&s;cribed for.</P>
<P>WE have with Plea&s;ure ob&s;erved the good Effects of that pious and laudable Erection of the <HI>Royal Infirmary:</HI> But have it to regret, that though the Funds of their Ho&s;pital be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, and managed with great Care and Frugality by
<PB N="4" REF="3">the Directors; yet we were often called to va&s;t Numbers of poor, mi&s;erable, &s;ick People; who could not be received into the Infirmary, becau&s;e their Stock is no ways an&s;werable to the Number of the di&s;ea&s;ed Poor.</P>
<P>How often did we &s;ee poor Servants or Workmen, ca&s;t out of Bu&s;ine&s;s by Indi&s;po|&s;ition, confined to a Bed of Straw, unable to help them&s;elves or hire others, de&s;titute of Meat, Drink, Fire, and all other Things nece&s;&s;ary for their Condition! Which made it impo&s;&s;ible for us, though never &s;o willing, to give that Relief by Medicine which their Ca&s;es required.</P>
<P>MISERABLE Objects of this kind were &s;o numerous, that in Town and Suburbs they amounted to &s;ome Hundreds, (of which nine or ten only could be taken in to the Infirmary at a Time.) What then mu&s;t be the Number in <HI>Scotland!</HI> Here Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, Charity and brotherly Love, Love to our Country, and even common Humanity &s;et us a thinking how to provide &s;ome Relief in &s;uch calamitous Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IT was for this Purpo&s;e that we frequent|ly conveened, and conferred together: But
<PB N="5" REF="4">finding it impo&s;&s;ible for us to attend, and provide any con&s;iderable Number with fuit|able Accommodation, as they lay &s;cattered in &s;o many different and di&s;tant Places; we concluded, that the Erection of a new Ho|&s;pital was the only proper Mean by which &s;uch Numbers could be duly taken care of by us.</P>
<P>THEREFORE we re&s;olved and determin|ed to afford them all the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance which our Surgery and Circum&s;tances would admit of, by laying the Foundation of a new Ho&s;pital, for curing and taking care of &s;uch, who&s;e Ca&s;es in a peculiar and proper Sen&s;e require a Surgeon.</P>
<P>FOR this Purpo&s;e, we concerted to enter into a Bond of Erection, obliging each of us to contribute Money and Medicines &s;uffi|cient to &s;et this good Work a-going, and to give our Attendance <HI>gratis</HI> during our Life.</P>
<P>OUR next Step was, to lay our whole Scheme before our Brethren at a Meeting of the Corporation, for their further Advice or Approbation, as well as to invite as many of them as inclined to join us.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>AT which Time our De&s;ign was approved of, and they agreed to call our Hou&s;e by the Name of <HI>The Surgeons Ho&s;pital.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had projected the Erecti|on of an Ho&s;pital, it immediately occurred to us, that the erecting a new, or enlarging the old one, might equally &s;erve the &s;ame Ends: Therefore it was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated among&s;t us, That as &s;oon as we &s;hould enter into a Bond of Erection, we &s;hould confer with, and make Propo&s;als to the Managers of the Infirmary, concerning an Union of the two Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY Propo&s;als of this kind were made to them in Writing, Conferences held for that Purpo&s;e, a Memorial given in to us by the &s;aid Managers, and a Reply to that Memorial was delivered to them by Mr. <HI>Kennedy,</HI> our Pre&s;es, and at that Time Deacon of the Surgeons, upon the fir&s;t <HI>Monday</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1736; to which we have got no An&s;wer the&s;e eight Months.</P>
<P>THIS we thought fit to mention, to &s;hew the World our Willingne&s;s to unite the two Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>ABOUT this Time it was often objected to us, That when the whole Corporation was invited and de&s;ired to &s;erve the Royal Infirmary, when newly erected, we refu&s;ed to concur and give our A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>HERE we mu&s;t deny the Fact: And we cannot but wonder how &s;o many People fall into this Mi&s;take, &s;o directly contrary to a publick Deed of the Corporation of Sur|geons; who at that Time obliged them|&s;elves, by an Act of their Society, to &s;erve, and furni&s;h Medicines to the Infirmary <HI>gratis,</HI> with as great Security for the Per|formance thereof as ever was given by them as a Society: Which Act is recorded in the Books of the Calling, dated the 10th <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> 1729.</P>
<P>WHEN Things were brought this Length, we began to contrive, how to make our Scheme more exten&s;ive, than what could be expected immediately from &s;uch &s;mall Funds: Therefore it was made an Article in our Con&s;titution, not only, to take care of as many as our Ho&s;pital and Funds could accommodate; but likewi&s;e, to give our Advice, with all proper Medicaments and Dre&s;&s;ings, to any who &s;hould be able to come to, or lodge near the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>AND, in the next Place, we appointed, That our Students and Apprentices &s;hould pay &s;omething into the Ho&s;pital-fund year|ly: Which they have hitherto done mo&s;t chearfully; and we hope, that, by their Help, and other charitable Donations, we &s;hall be able to make this Ho&s;pital a School of Practical Surgery; not only, advantage|ous and in&s;tructive to them and their Suc|ceffors in our Shops, but profitable to our Country, and in particular to this Metropo|lis: For it is certain, that as the Surgeons of this Country have been much employed, and had con&s;iderable Fame throughout the World, &s;o this Improvement of their Edu|cation will add to that Fame, and make <HI>Edinburgh</HI> an excellent Nur&s;ery for Phy&s;i|cians and Surgeons; and, by being &s;uch, how many thou&s;and Pounds will be &s;aved to our Country in a few Years, which now are &s;pent in <HI>Leyden</HI> and <HI>Paris?</HI></P>
<P>ADD to this, what Sums of Money we may expect will be returned to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> by our own Surgeons yearly returning home from all Corners of the World: Some have calculated <HI>L.</HI> 100,000 <HI>Sterling</HI> remit|ted to <HI>Scotland</HI> this Way within the&s;e twenty Years pa&s;t; and, if we judge of what may be, by what has been, it will be no incon&s;i|derable
<PB N="9" REF="8">Branch of Trade to our indigent Country.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Advantage wich we beg Leave to &s;ay will ari&s;e from this School of Surgery is, That our Country will hereafter be better &s;erved by Surgeons at home, when all of them may have the Advantages of Ho&s;pitals at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where their Educa|tion may be compleated, at an Expence all of them can afford; which never was the Ca&s;e before.</P>
<P>FROM what we have ob&s;erved concerning the Advantages of this School of Surgery it is evident, That if this Piece of Educati|on be confined to a few Surgeons and their Apprentices, &s;ecluding all the re&s;t, (what|ever private Benefit might ari&s;e to the&s;e few Surgeons, by &s;uch a Monopoly) it would not only be prejudicial to all tho&s;e who were &s;ecluded, but manife&s;tly &s;o to the Nation in general.</P>
<P>IF this Piece of Education be confined to a few, the Benefit ari&s;ing from it to our Country mu&s;t be limited proportionally: Suppo&s;e, for Example, one Fourth of our Apprentices and Students get their Educati|on compleated by Ho&s;pitals, and that the
<PB N="10" REF="9">remaining three Fourths mu&s;t want it; then, of Con&s;equence, a few of tho&s;e who go to &s;erve abroad may perhaps bring Money and Credit to our Nation, while the greate&s;t Part of them go unfini&s;hed, to ca&s;t the Bal|lance the other Way.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who &s;tay at home to &s;erve in their own Country, a few of them like|wi&s;e may be &s;ufficiently qualified for their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and fit to be tru&s;ted with the Lives and Health of the Lieges, while three Fourths of them, for Want of a complete Education, do more than over-ballance the Good done by the few skilful.</P>
<P>THIS is pretty obvious, and of this we were all &s;en&s;ible at the Beginning, and it had no &s;mall Influence on our fir&s;t Re&s;oluti|ons; therefore, we agreed to make our Scheme as exten&s;ive likewi&s;e in this View, and as u&s;eful to all the Surgeons and Ap|prentices in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as po&s;&s;ible, by in|viting the whole Corporation to join us, and to which they &s;till have Acce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the further Progre&s;s of this Affair: We next laid down Rules for the right Oeconomy of the Hou&s;e, much the &s;ame with the&s;e ob&s;erved in other Ho|&s;pitals;
<PB N="11" REF="10">and opened our Hou&s;e to Patients on the fir&s;t of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t: Since which Time we have been receiving in and taking Care of as many as our Hou&s;e could accommo|date, where two of us have attended punctu|ally every Day from Eleven to Twelve in the Forenoon, except <HI>Sunday,</HI> when we attended from four to five Afternoon, and the &s;ame attending Surgeons examine all Accounts every <HI>Monday.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Place, we think it not improper to take Notice, that however much we were convinced of the Nece&s;&s;ity of this Ho|&s;pital when fir&s;t it was projected, yet the &s;hort Experience we have had &s;ince the fir&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> has &s;et this Nece&s;&s;ity in a much &s;tronger Light than we could po&s;&s;ibly have imagined before this Trial; for although we have been, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, u&s;eful to, and cured many, yet if the Re&s;t of the World were to &s;ee what Numbers we are obliged to di&s;mi&s;s, purely for want of larger Funds; were they likewi&s;e to &s;ee from what &s;light Strains, or incon&s;iderable Brui&s;es, incurable Di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e, when not taken care of timeou&s;ly, they would very much lament our having neglected this Piece of Charity &s;o long.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<P>THE Gain of the mo&s;t Part of Servants is but daily Sub&s;i&s;tence, and few of them can afford to be many Days idle; hence it is, that &s;o many of them are made lame and mutilated, not to mention tho&s;e who die, purely becau&s;e they could neither afford them&s;elves proper Diet, Re&s;t, nor Medicine at the Beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e, when they might have been &s;peedily and ea&s;ily cured: So that in Truth, they may be more pro|perly &s;aid to derive all this Mi&s;ery from Want than Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IF no Provi&s;ion is made for the di&s;ea&s;ed Poor, and if they are left to linger out a mi&s;erable Life, without Expectation of any other Relief than Death, they are, in &s;ome Re&s;pect, in a wor&s;e Condition than the Bea&s;ts of Burthen, the Proprietor for his own Sake taking Care of them, while the poor Mechanick or Day-labourer is ca&s;t out naked and de&s;titute, to &s;truggle with Pain, Sickne&s;s, Poverty and Death.</P>
<P>IT is with Plea&s;ure that we reflect upon the publick Spirit which prevails at pre&s;ent for encouraging Trade and Manufacture, and we hope Ho&s;pitals may be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed u&s;eful that Way; for as the Riches of a Trading Nation chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the Num|ber
<PB N="13" REF="12">of well employed Hands, &s;o of con&s;e|quence tho&s;e who die through Want of timely Help, are &s;o many working Hands cut off from the Community: And the lame and the mutilated are often not only mi&s;e|rable them&s;elves, and a Burthen to their afflicted Friends, but, if we con&s;ider their Number throughout the Nation, they will be &s;ound no incon&s;iderable Tax upon the Country.</P>
<P>OUR next and great Care about this Ho&s;pital was, to &s;ettle it upon a la&s;ting Foundation, that it might not po&s;&s;ibly prove abortive before con&s;iderable Contributions could be rai&s;ed: This we have done in &s;uch a Manner, as to make the Stability of our pre&s;ent Scheme pretty certain.</P>
<P>NOW our la&s;t and con&s;tant Concern is, how to make it more exten&s;ive; for the Number of the Di&s;ea&s;ed is great, and our pre&s;ent Fund &s;mall.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have done our Part, and &s;hall continue to do according to our Abi|lity.</P>
<P>EVERY Trade&s;man employed in fitting up the Hou&s;e has contributed &s;omething; and
<PB N="14" REF="13">now we apply to all who &s;hall &s;ee this <HI>Me|morial,</HI> hoping none will be &s;o hard-hearted as to di&s;courage, or &s;o wicked as to oppo&s;e an Undertaking &s;o charitable, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Poor, and &s;o beneficial to our Country.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore, Generous Readers;</HI></P>
<P>WE now call upon you all, by the Titles of <HI>Men, Brethren</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> to denote our common Tie of Humanity, and yet nearer Tie of Chri&s;tian Charity. By what Arguments &s;hall we per&s;wade you to extend your Bounty to a poor Ho&s;pital in its Infancy?</P>
<P>IF you value the Prayers of tho&s;e you may re&s;tore to Health and Happine&s;s: If Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, the Intere&s;t of your Country, or the Approbation of our Sa|viour, can have Influence; come, like the good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> pour Wine and Oil into, and bind up the Wounds of your afflicted Brethren, by your Charity. Imagine your &s;elves given up to Pains and Want like theirs, or rather come and &s;ee the Mi&s;eries and untimely Deaths which you might &s;o ea&s;ily prevent, (for there is an Eloquence in vi&s;ible Di&s;tre&s;s beyond what can be ima|gined;) and we hope there will be no Need
<PB N="15" REF="14">of other Solicitations to di&s;po&s;e all of you to contribute according to the Circum&s;tances with which GOD has ble&s;&s;ed you.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>All the Money that is &s;ub&s;cribed for is payable to Mr.</HI> William Ward|rop <HI>Surgeon, our Trea&s;urer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sub&s;cribers for</HI> L. 5, <HI>or upwards, may be cho&s;en Directors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Names of Sub&s;cribers for</HI> L. 1, <HI>or upwards, will be printed in due Time.</HI></P>
