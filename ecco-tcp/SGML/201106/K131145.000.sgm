<P>SInce what Philo&s;ophers &s;ay of Naturali&s;ts and Phy&s;icians, that <HI>Ubi Phy&s;icus definit, ibi Medicus incipit;</HI> may be ap|plied in another Sen&s;e to this pre&s;ent Treati&s;e, it being de&s;igned <HI>THERE</HI> to <HI>Begin, WHERE</HI> Venereal Cures generally <HI>End:</HI> I &s;hall not here trouble my Readers with any Account at all of the Venereal or <HI>Secret Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> but refer them to the Three and Twentieth Edition of the <HI>Practical Scheme</HI> of that Di&s;temper, and Broken Con&s;titutions; to be had Gratis where this Book is given away: wherein is given an Account of a certain <HI>Specifick Remedy</HI> for that Di&s;ea&s;e, which of late Years has cured; with great Privacy, Certainty and Expedition great Numbers of Per|&s;ons, to their entire Satisfaction, from the &s;lighte&s;t Infection, to very bad Ca&s;es indeed, without Fluxing, A&s;tringents, and other &s;uch pernicious and dangerous Methods of Cure. For which Rea|&s;on to &s;ay any thing on that Matter wou'd be only <HI>Crambe repe|tita,</HI> and by con&s;equence rather Tire&s;ome than acceptable to 'em: My pre&s;ent De&s;ign therefore is to <HI>Continue</HI> here, and not to <HI>Repeat</HI> that Subject, by pre&s;enting my Readers with a &s;mall Di&s;|cour&s;e which &s;hall <HI>Commence,</HI> and take its <HI>Beginning,</HI> where Treati&s;es on the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e, and Veneral Cures u&s;ually <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>So that this Book is not de&s;igned for Per&s;ons who have any De|gree or Stage of the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e <HI>Actually</HI> upon them, till af|ter they are e&s;teem'd Cured, and <HI>have taken Leave</HI> of their Phy|&s;ician: And <HI>THEN</HI> 'tis, that I addre&s;s this pre&s;ent Work to them: In which to proceed in Order and Method I mu&s;t take no|tice to my Reader, that</P>
<P>A <HI>GLEET</HI> (to apply here the Language of Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> in a|nother Sen&s;e, in the Preface to his Treati&s;e of Anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Secretion) being a Di&s;order of one particular Part of the Animal Oeconomy, whatever adds any new Light to the Knowledge of <HI>This,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily clear the Di&s;covery of the Cau&s;e, Seat, and Nature of <HI>That,</HI> and by con&s;equence e&s;tabli&s;h its Cure upon a &s;urer Foun|dation than hitherto has been done, by enabling us to make a truer, and more certain Judgment of the Di&s;order. Since there|fore the Animal Body is now known to be a pure Machine, and many of its Motions and Actions are demon&s;trated to be the nece&s;|&s;ary Con&s;equences of its Structure, it as nece&s;&s;arily follows that the Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es in general, and of <HI>GLEETS</HI> in particular are likewi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of the Alteration of the Structures of certain particular Parts of this Oeconomy. In&s;omuch that a <HI>Gleet</HI> (as hereafter will clearly be &s;hewed) as nece&s;&s;arily follows from a Change of this Oeconomy and Structure of the Part which is its proper Seat, as perfect Health without any Di&s;|order
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">of a <HI>Gleet</HI> at all, is the con&s;equence of the perfect Oeco|nomy of the Part before any &s;uch <HI>Change</HI> happened.</P>
<P>If a <HI>Pendulum</HI> of &s;uch a Length makes a <HI>Clock</HI> to go ex+actly true; does not the Alteration of this <HI>Pendulum</HI> as nece&s;&s;a+rily cau&s;e it to go too fa&s;t or too &s;low? and when all the <HI>Move|ment</HI> is known to be in good Order, does not the quick or &s;low <HI>Motion</HI> of the <HI>Clock,</HI> as nece&s;&s;arily &s;hew the Fault of the <HI>Pen|dulum?</HI> It is the &s;ame thing in that <HI>Part of the Animal Bo|dy,</HI> which is the <HI>Seat of a Gleet:</HI> For the &s;ame <HI>Rea&s;onings</HI> hold good, <HI>caeteris paribus</HI> in all Sorts of <HI>Machines,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Motions</HI> are the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of their <HI>Structures.</HI> Now &s;uppo&s;e a Per&s;on to be entirely ignorant of the <HI>Structure</HI> of a <HI>Clock</HI> or <HI>Watch;</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould ever be able to put it in right Order, tho' he had never &s;o exact a <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of its irregular <HI>Motions.</HI></P>
<P>Tis on this Account that the <HI>Ancients</HI> not acquainted with our <HI>Modern Anatomical Di&s;coveries;</HI> were wholy ignorant of the true <HI>SEAT</HI> of the <HI>Infirmity</HI> we here treat of; the <HI>Know-</HI> of which is the only thing capable of informing our <HI>Judgment</HI> as to the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>Cure</HI> of it. This &s;o puzled them in expli|cating it's <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Origin;</HI> that &s;ome placed it in one thing, and &s;ome in another, but None of them in the right; for which rea&s;on it was, that the generality of them mi&s;&s;ing of its Cure, it began to be reputed an <HI>Infirmity</HI> and <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> truly not much le&s;s the <HI>Opprobrium Medicorum,</HI> then the <HI>Gout,</HI> and on this Account it is, that a <HI>Gleet</HI> (e&s;pecially if of any date) having elu|ded the Skill of very able <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> has been by the greate&s;t part of them pronounced incurable; which Reproach is not at all to be wondered at, &s;ince the <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of it was &s;o little under|&s;tood, and therefore might &s;till have remained &s;o, had it not been for tho&s;e mo&s;t excellent Di&s;coveries of late made by that great and ingenious Anatomi&s;t Mr. <HI>Cowper,</HI> who&s;e nice Ob&s;ervations of the inward Frame and Structure of That particular Part where a <HI>Gleet</HI> is &s;ituated, has given more Light and Information in this our pre&s;ent Que&s;tion, than all the Writings of the Ancients put together (the be&s;t of which upon this Subject were only the Effect of a happy Gue&s;s, and nothing at all of Certainty or Demon&s;tra|tion) ever did before. If therefore the Anatomical World, in the&s;e latter Years, had not been indefatigable in the Pur&s;uit of farther Di&s;coveries, we might have &s;et down to this Day by the glimmering Lights of the old Anatomi&s;ts, and &s;atisfy our &s;elves with their Chance Gue&s;&s;es as well in this as many other Matters. So that to this Ignorance of the true Seat of the Di&s;order, has
<PB N="4" REF="4">&s;een all along owing the frequent want of Succe&s;s in its Cure. For how can any Per&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to form a true Method of Cure for any Ailment or Infirmity, the Seat (and by Con&s;equence the Nature and Cau&s;e) of which he is not fir&s;t rightly appri&s;ed of?</P>
<P>As to the Motive of publi&s;hing this pre&s;ent Treati&s;e, (which I &s;hall endeavour to perform with as much Circum&s;pection and Wa|rine&s;s, as the Nicety of the Subject will po&s;&s;ibly admit of; and therefore, throughout the whole, I &s;hall take care not to &s;ully the Cha&s;te&s;t Imagination, or give any the lea&s;t Offence to the mo&s;t Mode&s;t of Mankind.) 'tis Twofold:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The great Unea&s;ine&s;s (notwith&s;tanding a daily Change of Linnen) which a great many Gentlemen and others oftentimes for many Years labour under, by rea&s;on of this Infirmity continu|ally upon them, which tho' for the pre&s;ent may give no other Trouble, than as it is oppo&s;ite to Cleanline&s;s, being no plea&s;ant Companion at all to a Clean Neat Per&s;on, yet will in time impair and break the very be&s;t of Con&s;titutions, and bring on a Con&s;ump|tion, as hereafter will clearly be &s;hewed.</P>
<P N="2">2ly The great Inconvenience Per&s;ons afflicted with <HI>Gleets,</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es, frequently labour under, from the great Quantities of Phy&s;ick exhibited to them for their Cure, which even it &s;elf is a Di&s;ea&s;e, and oftentimes &s;erves for little el&s;e than breaking a &s;ound Con&s;titution, or making a bad one wor&s;e.</P>
<P>In Order therefore to explicate more clearly the true Cau&s;e and Nature of <HI>Gleets</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es; and thereby be led into the true&s;t and mo&s;t rational Method of their Cure, it will fir&s;t of all be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to examine a little the Anatomy of That particular Part, where this Weakne&s;s is &s;ituated. As 1&s;t, Its inward Structure and Make. 2ly. What Al|terations this its Structure is &s;ubject to, and capable of. 3ly. What Effects &s;uch Alterations are likely to produce. And la&s;tly, Whether or no the&s;e Effects are &s;uch as Gentlemen and others find in them&s;elves, who have the Unhappine&s;s of a <HI>Gleet,</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es upon them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Some few Anatomical Ob&s;ervations nece&s;&s;ary to be taken Notice of, in order to a right Knowledge of the true Cau&s;e, Seat, and Nature of</HI> Gleets, <HI>and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY a GLEET is under&s;tood an <HI>Involuntary</HI> and almo&s;t con&s;tant Efflux or <HI>Dripping</HI> away of Matter from a Human Body, and that in much the &s;ame Quanti|ty, whether the Per&s;on be a&s;leep or awake. From which Definition it naturally offers it &s;elf to our Con&s;ideration, to enquire into the Cau&s;e of this Efflux of Matter, and how
<PB N="5" REF="5">it happens that &s;uch a Quantity of Matter &s;hould thus Involuntarily come away. Which Difficulty will ea&s;ily be remov'd by examining the inward Anatomical Structure of the Part where this Weakne&s;s is &s;ituated, which is the only thing that can give Light to our pre&s;ent Que&s;tion: And then to examin if there is naturally any Liquor &s;e|parated in that Part, capable of becoming the Matter of that Epidemical Weakne&s;s and common Companion of Mankind, u&s;ually called a GLEET.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable by Anatomy, that in the Nervo-Spon|gious Sub&s;tance of the Urethra or Urinary Pa&s;&s;age, there are &s;everal Glandulous Openings, fir&s;t di&s;covered by that great Anatomi&s;t Mr. <HI>Cowper,</HI> which &s;erve as &s;o many ex|cretory Ducts or Channels de&s;igned by Naure con&s;tantly to convey and furni&s;h a certain vi&s;cid, clammy, Mucous kind of Liquor or Moi&s;ture into the Urinary Pa&s;&s;age; The U&s;e of which Liquor is to lubricate and be&s;mear, by its Vi&s;cidity, the Pipe or Pa&s;&s;age, and thereby to pre&s;erve and defend it from being fretted and corroded by the &s;harp Salts of the Urine which is daily pa&s;&s;ing thro' it, and which, without this defen&s;ative Liquor, would certainly be Fretted, and become Raw, and by con&s;equence Sore, as <HI>any</HI> Fle&s;hy Part wou'd be, that &s;hould have &s;uch a &s;alt &s;harp acrimonious fretting Liquor as Urine &s;o often pa&s;&s;ing on it, unle&s;s it were pre&s;erved by &s;ome &s;uch proper Defen&s;a|tive, as the continual anointing or be&s;mearing it with &s;ome &s;uch &s;mooth, &s;oft, bal&s;amick, unctious Sub&s;tance would be: In&s;omuch that were it not for this unctious Liquor or Moi&s;ture that Nature is continually &s;upplying the Urinary Pa&s;&s;age with, by means of tho&s;e Glandu|lous Openings abovementioned, to keep it thus moi&s;t, it would in a little time become &s;o fretted and Raw, by the Sharpne&s;s of the Urine daily pa&s;&s;ing thro' it, that <HI>All Mankind wou'd have a perpetual Scalding and Heat of Urine;</HI> by which I do not mean, that the Urine in it &s;elf would be Hotter, in that Suppo&s;ition, than it is now, but that the Pa&s;&s;age being raw and &s;ore for want of that defen&s;ative &s;limy Moi&s;ture, which now protects it, it wou'd be fret|ted by the Saltne&s;s of the Urine, and &s;o wou'd &s;mart, and &s;eem as it were to Burn and Scald, whenever the Urine pa&s;&s;ed thro' it: Ju&s;t as any other Raw Sore Place dive|&s;ted of its Scarf-Skin, wou'd &s;mart and &s;eem as it were to burn if one &s;hou'd throw Urine, or Salt Water upon it.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<P>This being thus e&s;tabli&s;h'd from the nice Anatomical In&s;pection of the Urethra, we are now to con&s;ider what Changes and Alterations the&s;e Glandulous Openings in the Pa&s;&s;age, are &s;ubject to, and capable of: And then whether or no &s;uch Changes can furni&s;h us with &s;uch a large Supply of Matter as daily is experienced <HI>Involuntari|ly</HI> to Drip away from Per&s;ons who have that Weakne&s;s commonly called a <HI>Gleet</HI> upon them. So that a thorough Enquiry into this Matter will lead us directly into an ex|act Knowledge of the true Seat, Cau&s;e, and Nature of <HI>Gleets,</HI> without being put upon any Nece&s;&s;ity of having Re|cour&s;e to any other Part, that in reality has no manner of Claim to fall under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration: As for Ex|ample, the <HI>Pro&s;tatae,</HI> or Seminal Ve&s;&s;els, which tho' vul|garly e&s;teem'd to furni&s;h the Matter of a <HI>Gleet,</HI> yet have no Share at all in it; and for this Rea&s;on it is, that the Vulgar commonly, tho' very ignorantly and impro|perly call a <HI>Gleet</HI> a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> which are widely different, as hereafter will appear; the true and only Seat of a Gleet, being the Urethra, or Urinary Pa&s;&s;age, as by and by will clearly be made appear.</P>
<P>Our next Endeavour therefore mu&s;t be to examine how the <HI>Urethra</HI> only and the Glandulous Openings abovemen|tioned which it contains, are able to furni&s;h &s;o great a quantity of Matter, as is ob&s;erved to be <HI>involuntarily</HI> di&s;|charged in the cour&s;e of a <HI>Gleet.</HI> In order to which we mu&s;t con&s;ider, That Nature de&s;igning the&s;e Glands in the Urethra con&s;tantly to furni&s;h and &s;upply a certain Moi&s;ture to the whole Pipe or Pa&s;&s;age, which may defend it from being fretted by the &s;harp Urine &s;o frequently pa&s;&s;ing through it, as has been already &s;hewed, the O|rifices or Mouths of the&s;e Glands in entire healthy, &s;ound, hail Per&s;ons are in &s;ome mea&s;ure, (if I may u&s;e the Com|pari&s;on <HI>&s;ervata</HI> always <HI>debit&acirc; proportione</HI>) like the Sphin|cter Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Anus,</HI> Bladder, &amp;c. I mean by this, that the openings of the&s;e Glands, notwith&s;tanding their being &s;o very &s;mall, have a certain Springine&s;s and Ela|&s;ticity proportionable to their Bigne&s;s and Size, belong ing to them, by which they are endowed with a certain power of &s;traitning, contracting and drawing them&s;elves, togather more or le&s;s upon every Emi&s;&s;ion of that Moi|&s;ture Nature de&s;igns them to &s;upply the Urethra with: ju&s;t as the Sphincter Mu&s;cle of the Bladder is endow|ed
<PB N="7" REF="7">with a Power of retaining, holding, and keeping in the Urine. And by this means it is, that ju&s;t &s;o much and no more of this Moi&s;ture is thrown out of the&s;e Glands into the Urethra, than is ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the Lubrication and Moi&s;tening of it, preparatively for the pa&s;|&s;age of the Urine. Nor is this at at all to be que&s;tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Orifices and Mouths of the&s;e &s;mall mi|nute Glands in the pa&s;&s;age, have every one of them a pro|per power of opening and contracting them&s;elves, pro|portionable to their bigne&s;s and &s;ize, not unlike, as I ju&s;t now &s;aid, to the Sphincter Mu&s;cles in other Parts of the Bo|dy, &s;ince we &s;ee that even a &s;mall Mite, taken for Example out of corrupted Chee&s;e, and which is &s;carce di&s;cernable by the naked Eye, yet by the help of a good Micro&s;cope, it appears to be an Animal as compleatly furni&s;hed with all nece&s;&s;ary Parts, as other Animals who&s;e &s;ize makes them the con&s;picuous Objects of our una&s;&s;i&s;ted Sight So that as by rea&s;on of the &s;trength and vigour of the Sphincter Mu&s;cles, for Example of the Bladder; the Neck and Mouth of it is endowed with a power of &s;traitening, contract|ing and clo&s;ing it &s;elf together after every Emi&s;&s;ion of Urine, every one experiences in them&s;elves a power of either holding or letting go their Water: So, much in the &s;ame manner, by rea&s;on of the &s;trength and vigour of the Orifices of the&s;e Glandules, they are endowed with not an unlike power of &s;traitening, contracting, and drawing them&s;elves together (which I de&s;ire my Reader always to &s;uppo&s;e to be in a degree proportionable &s;till to their Bigne&s;s) after every Emi&s;&s;ion of the mucous &s;limy Liquor they contain: Which &s;trength being once lo&s;t, the power al&s;o of retaining and keeping in this Liquor is al&s;o lo&s;t with it. The State then and Condition of the&s;e Glandulous openings (or as Dr. <HI>Drake</HI> calls them <HI>Mucous Glands</HI>) from their thus furni&s;hing and &s;upplying the Pa&s;|&s;age with this Mucous Liqor,) being thus con&s;i|der'd in healthy Per&s;ons. Our next Enquiry mu&s;t be into the &s;tate of the&s;e Mucous Glands in Per&s;ons afflicted with a <HI>Gleet.</HI> Which &s;tate we &s;hall &s;oon be appri&s;ed of by con|&s;idering that when a Per&s;on has been under Cure for the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e, the fatigue of Antivenereal Medicines, e&s;|pecially if ill admini&s;tred, by a frequent pre&s;&s;ure upon, and irritation of the&s;e Glands, has rendred them flaccid, limber, weak, and loo&s;e, which before were healthy, vigo|rous,
<PB N="8" REF="8">&s;pringy and &s;trong. The truth of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions (ab&s;tracting from the rea&s;onablene&s;s they carry along with them) will appear by giving my Reader an Account of the &s;tate of the&s;e Glands as they have been ob&s;erved in &s;ome Anatomical Di&s;&s;ections made of that particular part where all <HI>Gleets</HI> are &s;eated, I mean the Urethra or U|rinary Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>That great Anatomi&s;t Mr. <HI>Cowper</HI> tells us, that to in|form him&s;elf the better in this Point, he Di&s;&s;ected the Urinary Pa&s;&s;age of &s;everal Criminals who had been Exe|cuted: Some of which were healthy found Per&s;ons: The others were Executed with <HI>Gleets</HI> upon them. In the healthy &s;ound Per&s;ons, he found the&s;e Glandulous open|ings to be &s;o firm, as to have had a perfect Ela&s;ticity, or Springine&s;s: In&s;omuch that upon pre&s;&s;ing them, he &s;ays, they di&s;charged a certain quantity of a tran&s;parent vi&s;cous Liquor, &s;uch as it &s;hews it &s;elf, and ought to be <HI>in &s;tatu &s;ano;</HI> whereas if the&s;e Glands had not had &s;uch a firmne&s;s and &s;trength, in which con&s;i&s;ted their power of retain|ing or letting go the vi&s;cid clammy Liquor they contain; this Liquor would have &s;lipped out of them without any Pre&s;&s;ure at all: And by con&s;equence, its not owzing out, but upon &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ure, was an evident mark of their &s;pringyne&s;s and &s;trength. He al&s;o ob&s;erved the whole U|rethra to be be&s;meared and lined with a Liquor of a vi&s;|cous clammy contexture, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been di&s;charged from the&s;e <HI>Glandulae Muco&s;ae,</HI> in order to lubricate the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But in the Urethra of Criminals Executed with a <HI>Gleet</HI> actually upon them, and which they had had many Years, the Ca&s;e was quite different. He ob&s;erved the Mucous Glands to be limber, flaccid, and loo&s;e, very much &s;tretched and dilated: And their Orifices by the help of a nice Micro&s;cope to be vi&s;ibly open, and thereby totally de&s;titute of their Strength and Vigour, from whence he judiciou&s;ly concluded, that they were al&s;o entirely deprived of their retentive Faculty and Springyne&s;s, ha|ving no power left of contracting them&s;elves upon any emi&s;&s;ion of that mucous clammy Liquor they contain, as tho&s;e other Glands could do in the Criminals that were Executed in perfect Health. After this he examined in the Executed Criminals that were thus di&s;&s;ected, the &s;tate of the <HI>Pro&s;tatae,</HI> the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales</HI> and the <HI>Para&s;tatae,</HI> all
<PB N="9" REF="9">which he found to be as perfectly &s;ound and entire, as in any healthy Per&s;on he ever di&s;&s;ected in his life; which is a convincing Proof, that neither the <HI>Pro&s;tatae, Ve&s;iculae Seminales</HI> nor the <HI>Para&s;tatae</HI> have any the lea&s;t &s;hare at all in the Seat or Cau&s;e of a <HI>Gleet.</HI> This will appear &s;till more clear, by an Example from Per&s;ons who have a <HI>Dia|betes</HI> upon them: For from the lo&s;s of the Springine&s;s and Tone of the Sphincter Mu&s;cle of the Bladder; the Neck and Mouth of it is &s;o weakened and relaxed, as to be deprived of its retentive Faculty, through a want of that power of contracting and drawing it &s;elf together after any Emi&s;&s;ion of Urine which healthy Per&s;ons ex|perience in them&s;elves: from whence it follows, that the Urine comes away involuntarily from them, being alto|gether deprived of both that Expul&s;ive, as well as Re|tentive power which healthy Per&s;ons have.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ob&s;ervations being thus premi&s;ed, and which are fully &s;ufficient to convince any one who&s;e Eyes are not &s;hut again&s;t demon&s;tration, that what the Ancients gene|rally thought as to the Cure of Gleets was built upon a very wrong Foundation: <HI>viz.</HI> An erroneous Notion of its Cau&s;e and Seat.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>How the Weakne&s;s and flaccid State abovementi|oned of the Mucous Glands, and their Orifices or Mouths in the Urethra, are the true Cau&s;e of</HI> Glects,</HEAD>
<P>THE Springine&s;s and retentive Faculty of the Mu|cous Glands in the Urethra of healthy &s;ound Per|&s;ons who are &s;uppo&s;ed never to have had the Secret Di&s;|ea&s;e upon them con&s;i&s;ting in their Strength and Power of either di&s;ating or contracting their Orifices or <HI>O&s;tiola,</HI> (as in the foregoing Chapter has been &s;hewed) by which Power of retaining or letting out the vi&s;cous Liquor
<PB N="10" REF="10">they contain, they di&s;charge ju&s;t &s;o much and no more of it, than is ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the lubrication and be&s;mear|ing of the Pa&s;&s;age: it mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity follow, that when the&s;e Glands are, by the long U&s;e of Medicines, or other means, as a long Continuance of the Di&s;ea&s;e <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o weakened as to become limber, flaccid, flabby, and loo&s;e, they mu&s;t al&s;o be deprived of this retentive Pow|er or Faculty. In&s;omuch that altho' the&s;e Glands in heal|thy &s;ound Per&s;ons, who never had the Misfortune of the <HI>Secret Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> are naturally &s;o Springy and Strong as to di&s;charge and let out into the Urethra, ju&s;t &s;o much and no more of the &s;limy Liquor de&s;igned by Nature to be&s;mear, and as it were cover over the whole Tube or Pa&s;&s;age, and there by defend it from the Sharpne&s;s of the Urine: Yet in mo&s;t Per&s;ons who have been ever cured of the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e, the Ca&s;e is generally &s;peaking not &s;o. For the Orifices or <HI>O&s;tiola</HI> of the&s;e Glands in the&s;e <HI>Cured</HI> Per&s;ons, are &s;o weakened and relaxed by the Fatigue of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and its Cure, as to be in a manner always o|pen, by which means the Mucous Liquor they contain, is continually &s;lipping out of them into the Urethra; the Openings of the&s;e Glands not having Springine&s;s, Ela&s;tici|ty, nor Strength left to contract them&s;elves, and thereby to keep it in as formerly; by which means the contained Li|quor involuntarily and continually comes out into the Urethra, and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Quantities of it pu&s;hing one after another drips and owzes away <HI>Involuntarily</HI> from the Body.</P>
<P>The Difficulty then that now remains is to conceive how &s;uch very &s;mall Glands and their Orifices can fur|ni&s;h &s;uch a Quantity of Matter, as is daily experienced to flow away in &s;ome <HI>Gleets,</HI> and how the Mucous Liquor which is naturally di&s;charged out of the&s;e Glands into the Urethra in healthy Per&s;ons, &s;hould be increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree as 'tis in Per&s;ons who have a <HI>Gleet.</HI> This Dif|ficulty will ea&s;ily be removed to any Per&s;on who will but allow that the Mucous Glands in the Urethra, altho' &s;o very &s;mall in them&s;elves as to be invi&s;ible to the Naked Eye, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Help of a Micro&s;cope, yet they may naturally &s;ecerne &s;uch a Quantity of Fluid in any determinate Time, as is fully &s;ufficient to become the Matter of (that common Accident now adays) a <HI>Gleet.</HI></P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this Matter, I hope it will be allowed that the&s;e Mucous Glands, as little as they are, may naturally
<PB N="11" REF="11">di&s;charge into the Urethra for its Lubrication, as much of this Liquor in one Minute as may weigh at lea&s;t one Quar|ter of a Grain: This in an Hour will be 15 Grains, or a Quarter of a Dram: In 24 Hours, or a natural Day, it will amount to 6 Drams, which is 3 Quarters of an Ounce; a Quantity &s;ufficient in all rea&s;on to give that Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Per&s;on, as well as Wetne&s;s to the Linnen, which is u&s;ually experienced by tho&s;e under the uncomfortable Circum&s;tances of a <HI>Gleet:</HI> And which is more than either the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales</HI> or the <HI>Pro&s;tatae</HI> can continue to furni&s;h in any con&s;iderable Space of Time, without infinite more Detriment to the Body, than Per&s;ons afflicted with <HI>Gleets</HI> u&s;ually experience. Hence it is evident that the Glands the Urethra are full as capable of being the Springs that &s;upply the Liquor that Drips away in a <HI>Gleet,</HI> as the <HI>Pro&s;ta+tae,</HI> or any other pretended Part &s;ituated at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>If you ask, how the&s;e Glands in the Urethra can di&s;|charge &s;o great a Quantity of Fluid in the time of a <HI>Gleet,</HI> above what they do in their natural State. I an&s;wer, that it is manife&s;t from the Animal OEconomy, that if any Gland or excretory Duct be Weakened, and depri|ved of its retentive Faculty, the Quantity of Liquor that it di&s;charges, by Rea&s;on of that Weakne&s;s, is con&s;idera|bly augmented in Proportion to the greater or le&s;s De|grce of Weakne&s;s with which the&s;e Glands or Ducts are affected: Ju&s;t as a little Powder of <HI>Cantharides</HI> applied any where, by breaking thro' the Texture of the Cuticular Scarf-Skin, does &s;o weaken the Glands as &s;oon to excite a Bli&s;ter, and by it thus weakning the Glands, makes them di&s;charge a Quantity of Matter immen&s;ly greater than what wou'd naturally flow away from that Part by in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration only. Much in the &s;ame Manner the Orifices of the&s;e Glands being weakened and relaxed, have thereby lo&s;t their retentive Faculty, and therefore cannot hold in the Liquor they contain, but lets more of it &s;lip away than the mere Lubrication of the Urethra re|quires, and therefore it continually is di&s;charging it &s;elf by that Dripping, which is commonly called a <HI>Gleet.</HI></P>
<P>Hence all the Difficulties about a <HI>Gleet</HI> are overcome in a few Words; Its Symptoms become obvious upon a &s;mall Principle &s;o clear in Anatomy, as to carry not only Evi|dence along with it, but al&s;o more clearly explicates all the Symptoms and Effects of it, than hitherto is ob&s;er|ved
<PB N="12" REF="12">to have been done.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides a <HI>Gleet</HI> from the abovementioned Cau&s;es it frequently happens, that &s;ome Per&s;ons after even a &s;afe and &s;ure Cure of the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pecially where the Infection has been confiderable, have for a long Time after been vexed with the Appearance of a lit|tle owzing of a &s;limy tran&s;parent Sub&s;tance not &s;o much as the Quantity of a Drop at a Time; which upon their Linnen looks &s;ometimes of no ill Colour, tho' al&s;o &s;ome|times it will give it a yellowi&s;h Tinge no bigger per|haps than a great Pin's Head, which frequently alarms 'em, they thinking &s;ome Infection lies &s;till lurking, when the Cau&s;e in reality has been over-weakne&s;s, and over|heating of the Parts <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and which, upon endeavour|ing to carry off by Purging, has rather increa&s;ed, by re|laxing the Ve&s;&s;els, and weakning their Springine&s;s and and Tone: Per&s;ons with &s;uch <HI>Gleets</HI> as the&s;e, have ge|nerally little Threads, and Skins, or &s;uch like, &s;wim|ming in Variety of Figures about their Urine, and the Orifice of the Urinary Pa&s;&s;age is frequently gumm'd up therewith. The&s;e <HI>Gleets</HI> u&s;uall attend hot &s;anguine Con|&s;titutions, and in Time brings on pains and Weakne&s;s in the Loins, and has at la&s;t terminated in incureable Con|&s;umptions, whereas if &s;ome &s;trengthning Medicines pe|culiarly adapted to tho&s;e Parts, had but at fir&s;t been ju|diciou&s;ly applied, not only the Di&s;order it &s;elf might have been timely cured, but al&s;o the&s;e ill Con&s;equences happily prevented. By which Medicines I under&s;tand &s;uch as are appropriated to re&s;tore the injured Parts to a State of Soundne&s;s, as well as to pre&s;erve them &s;o. Thus if the Tone of the Parts be but ree&s;tabli&s;hed by Proper Re&s;torative Medicines, their acquired Strength will enable them to re&s;i&s;t the Ingre&s;s of new Supplies of peccant Matter, and turn them off to be di&s;|charged another way. Thus the Cure is attained with|out Violence, Pain, or Inconvenience to the Patient: and in this Sen&s;e it is (generally &s;peaking) to be under&s;tood, that &s;ometimes a <HI>Gleet</HI> will remain after the be&s;t of Cures.</P>

<P>THE Mis&s;ortune I here mean is that which the Holy Scriptures mention, <HI>Gen.</HI> c. 38. v. 10, of <HI>Onan,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="13">Who&s;e Name only will put my Reader at once in mind, not only of the Sin, but al&s;o of the terrible Puni&s;hment, which Almighty God in&s;tantly and out of hand inflicted upon him, expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Words, <HI>And therefore the Lord Cut him off, becau&s;e he had done a Dete&s;table Thing. Ideo percu&s;&s;it eum Dominus quod rem</HI> DETESTABILEM <HI>faceret,</HI> &s;ays the Vulgate Edition. And yet notwith&s;tanding &s;o very &s;evere an Expre&s;&s;ion of the Scripture, this Unhap|py Misfortune is &s;o frequent, and crying an Offence, e&s;pecially among&s;t the more Flouri&s;hing Part of Man kind, that there is a great deal of Rea&s;on to imagin that many Delinquents would never have been &s;uch, if they had but been throughly appri&s;ed of the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Crime, and the very &s;ad Con&s;equences to the Body, as well as the Soul, which follow from it; And which indeed is the Motive that has induced me to the writing of this Chapter.</P>
<P>But as it is very difficult to write on a Subject of &s;o nice a Nature as this is, within the reach of the mean|e&s;t Capacities, without making &s;ome Encroachment up|on the Rules and Bounds of Decency, and the Ri&s;que of giving &s;ome Offence, notwith&s;tanding it may proceed from a De&s;ign to promote Virtue, and di&s;courage Vice: I &s;hall therefore rather choo&s;e to expre&s;s my &s;elf &s;o as to be le&s;s intelligible to &s;ome, by leaving &s;everal Things to my Readers private Con&s;ideration, than by an over|freedom of Expre&s;&s;ion, to run the hazard of putting that into any cha&s;t Mind, which every Per&s;on ought with the utmo&s;t Chri&s;tian Courage and Care to &s;tifle and de&s;troy. Subjects of this Nature being as Dr. <HI>Bay|nard</HI> calls it, <HI>Res faeda dictu,</HI> and the Scripture, <HI>a dete|&s;table Thing,</HI> and what (if mere Nece&s;&s;ity did not urge) St. <HI>Paul</HI> forbids even to be &s;o much as NAM'D among&s;t Chri&s;tians, <HI>Nec nominetur in vobis:</HI> For which rea&s;on if ever Caution, Care, and Circum&s;pection is nece&s;&s;ary in the Treating of any Moral Subject in the World, 'tis mo&s;t certainly in this: Wherein St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought he could expre&s;s the Enormity of the Crime by no Word more Emphatical and Expre&s;&s;ive, than by impo&s;ing a <HI>perpetual Silence</HI> of it among&s;t tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who&s;e not only Name, but Life and Conver&s;ation, &s;poke them to be Chri&s;tians; for which Rea&s;on it was, that an Anci|ent Author thought he could give no better a Mark to
<PB N="14" REF="14">di&s;tingui&s;h between Chri&s;tians and Heathens, who being totally ab&s;orpt, drown'd, and given up to a Reprobate Sen&s;e, Uncleanne&s;s, and their own Pa&s;&s;ions, they di&s;ho|nour'd their own Bodies, (to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion of the Scripture) then the Purity of Life and Conver&s;ation in the Former, and not in their outward Name and Profe&s;&s;ion only; and therefore &s;ays he, We Chri&s;tians <HI>Non magn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Loquimur, &s;ed</HI> VIVIMUS.</P>
<P>I doubt not but tho&s;e Per&s;ons who&s;e guilty Con&s;cience &s;hall tell them that they are concerned in this pre&s;ent Chapter, will under&s;tand the Meaning of it, without much Explication: And 'tis to them I recommend it, with my hearty De&s;ire of their mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration of what is contained in it: And as for tho&s;e whom it no way concerns, and by con&s;equence who under&s;tand it not (O happy Ignorance!) I cougratulate them their un&s;potted Innocence, <HI>Rara Avis in terris,!</HI> I'll endeavour to &s;ay no|thing which &s;hall endanger their loo&s;ing, but rather confirm their happy keeping it.</P>
<P>To proceed therefore in our Subject: By this Doctrine is excluded every even the lea&s;t Impure and Immode&s;t Action as unlawful, and to be bani&s;hed the Conver&s;ation of Chri&s;tians, who&s;e Characteri&s;tick Mark ought to be Mode&s;ty, as being thereby the very <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s of the Holy Cho&s;t;</HI> than which Con&s;ideration St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought he could produce no one more powerful, to di&s;&s;wade Chri|&s;tians from all manner of Uncleanne&s;s what&s;oever. The Apo&s;tles Argument is this: That if Material Temples, dedicated only to the external Wor&s;hip of Almighty God, are in no wi&s;e to be pro&s;aned; much le&s;s Spiritu|al ones, &s;uch as our Bodies are, in which the Spirit of Almighty God inhabits. This Reflection of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> gives us clearly to under&s;tand, that whenever we give our &s;elves over to Uncleanne&s;s, our Bodies are no more the Temples of the Holy Gho&s;t: For which Rea&s;on he tells us expre&s;sly, that not being our own, by con&s;e|quence we are not at our own Di&s;po&s;al, being <HI>Bought with a great Price,</HI> and ought therefore to be &s;o far from Abu&s;ing and defiling our &s;elves, that we ought to glorify God in even our BODIES, which are God's, as well as our Spirits, all which is utterly de&s;troyed by tho&s;e Mi&s;|fortunes this Chapter here treats of.</P>
<P>My Reader may therefore take this for a general Rule,
<PB N="15" REF="15">that a Chri&s;tian is bound to &s;hun whatever Sen&s;ualizes the Soul, and tends only to gratify unlawful (i. e. out of a Conjugal State) Pa&s;&s;ions, it being always unlawful out of that State, to draw any immode&s;t Plea&s;ure from our own Bodies, on any Pretence what&s;oever.</P>
<P>To condemn therefore, and di&s;&s;wade again&s;t a Sin, &s;o very di&s;plea&s;ing to Almighty God: So detrimental to the Common-Wealth: And &s;o highly injurious to our &s;elves, requires no Arguments which are not en|tirely agreeable to Truth, and can &s;tand the Te&s;t of the &s;tricte&s;t Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Its being a very great Offence again&s;t Almighty God, &s;ufficiently appears, in that there is not a Place in Holy Writ, where Sins of Uncleanne&s;s are condemned, but that Unhappy One this Chapter treats of, is among&s;t others hinted at, with a Conclu&s;ion, that <HI>Nothing Impure, nor who acts any &s;uch Abominable Things, &s;hall ever inherit the Kingdom of God:</HI> but are to <HI>have a Part in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brim&s;tone:</HI> And altho 'tis a Saying no le&s;s true than Terrible, of an Ancient Author, that Sin|ners are always <HI>Sure</HI> of their Sin, and <HI>Uncertain</HI> of their Pardon; yet from what has hitherto been &s;aid, all Per|&s;ons herein concerned ought &s;eriou&s;ly to betake them&s;elves to true Repentance, and that betimes too, le&s;t by Neg|lect in the End they misfortunately find them&s;elves in the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> of whom it is related, that <HI>Orabat Scel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ius Dominum, a quo non e&s;&s;et mi&s;ericordiam con&s;e|cuturus.</HI> The Ca&s;e of too many delay'd ('till on a Death-Bed) Repentance.

<PB N="18" REF="18">&s;trong and lu&s;ty before they abandoned them&s;elves to this Vice, have been &s;o entirely Worn out and Ruined by it, as to become Old before half their Years came on: For by thus robbing them&s;elves of their Strength, and empoveri&s;hing their Spirits by depriving their Bo|dies of its Balmy and Vital Juice by this abominable Practice, they have become &s;o dry and emaciated, as to be &s;ent to their Graves, a great many Years &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e they would have been.</P>
<P>Perhaps my Reader may ask of me, that &s;ince the Weakne&s;s of Mankind and Propen&s;ion to Ill is &s;o very great, that if we run thro' the whole Decalogue, there is not one Precept who&s;e Transgre&s;&s;ors de&s;erve more Commi&s;eration and Pity than this: What way mu&s;t Youth pre&s;erve them&s;elves from it? No one's Strength being to be depended on in this Point, for tho&s;e who think them&s;elves &s;ecure, St. <HI>Paul</HI> charges to take Care lea&s;t they fall: So that if we tru&s;t only to our Rea&s;on, we &s;hall find in the End that this is no manner of Match at all to our Inclinations, which are infinitely &s;tronger: In&s;omuch that whoever beats a Parley with Sen&s;ual Plea&s;ures, is already capitulating with his Enemy, and will be vanqui&s;hed at la&s;t. The great Pre&s;ervative then is chiefly to avoid Idlene&s;s, and fly all Occa&s;ions of Ill: <HI>Apprehende Fugam,</HI> (&s;ays an Ancient Author) <HI>&s;i vis habere Victoriam.</HI> For <HI>Qui tangit Picem,</HI> as &s;urely <HI>inquina|bitur ab e&acirc;,</HI> As he who loves <HI>Periculum,</HI> mo&s;t certainly &s;ooner or later <HI>in illo peribit.</HI> And therefore they will find to their Sorrow, that a &s;hort Fleeting Plea&s;ure of only a Moment, <HI>in fine mordebit ut Coluber:</HI> Like a poor &s;illy Fly hovering about the Flame, thinking it to be as &s;weet as it appears fair, peri&s;hes at the fir&s;t Tryal. And however &s;uch Per&s;ons may thro' the In&s;tigation of the Devil flatter them&s;elves, that whenever the Fact is committed, that it is but a trifling Fault; yet it has &s;o Tarni&s;hed their Soul, that afterwards they can have no Innocence to boa&s;t of, having prodigally Barter'd it for a momentary Satisfaction, as <HI>E&s;au</HI> did with his Birth-right, for the tran&s;ient Sen&s;uality of a Me&s;s of Pottage; the Barrier that fenced their Cha&s;tity being broke, the Enemy to Purity and Holine&s;s makes daily Incur&s;ions, and ravages thro' every Pa&s;&s;age of the Conquered Soul. And altho' by a demure outward Be

<P>How many unhappy Souls are there in the World, who never would have been guilty of enormous Crimes, if they had not in their Youths been initiated in Sin by this unhappy Practice? And how many again are there, who&s;e Affairs in the World Almighty God has attended with Judgments ever &s;ince, as a Puni&s;hment of &s;uch horrid Facts committed formerly in their Youth. To avert all which the only way is to practice Vir|tue betimes, and early to leave off the&s;e Abominations: And whatever Difficulty is experienced in overcoming a vicious Habit, the per&s;ons mu&s;t con&s;ider, that it is a Burden of their own making, and therefore they ought the more chearfully to undergo the overcomeing it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 4. <HI>Of a</HI> Simple Gonorrhaea, <HI>whence it proceeds, and how it differs from a common</HI> Gleet.</HEAD>
<P>BE&s;ides the Infirmity hitherto treated of, there is yet another &s;ort of Weakne&s;s of much wor&s;e Con&s;equence, and which for the re&s;emblance it bears to a Gleet, is often confounded under the &s;ame Name by Per&s;ons unacquaint|ed with the Difference, whereas in rigour 'tis no &s;uch thing, and is properly called a <HI>Simple Gonorrhaea,</HI> to di|&s;tingui&s;h it from that virulent Efflux of Matter common|ly, tho' very improperly called a Gonorrhaea, and is That which afflicts Per&s;ons who have actually the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A <HI>Simple Gonorrhaea</HI> is an involuntary Emi&s;&s;ion of a real &s;eminal Matter by rea&s;on of the Caruncles through which it owzes from the Neck of the Ve&s;iculae &s;eminales into the Urethra being &s;o injured, weakned and relaxed in their Fibres, as to permit the &s;eminal Matter in&s;en&s;ibly to come away. This is an Infirmity that may indeed, but does not often happen; and when it does, the Per&s;on in a little time grows lean, pale, weak and feeble, e&s;pecially about the Loins, and is &s;oon brought into a <HI>Tales Dor&s;alis,</HI> and if not &s;peedily taken care of, to his Grave. So that notwith&s;tanding the vulgar call almo&s;t every involuntary
<PB N="20" REF="20">emi&s;&s;ion of Matter from a human Body a Gonorrhaea, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this Infirmity la&s;t mentioned is only and truly a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> or Efflux of real and true &s;eminal Matter. Wherea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> neither in a <HI>Gleet,</HI> nor in any Stage or Degree of the Se|cret Di&s;ea&s;e, any true Seminal Matter comes away, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> manife&s;t from what has been already &s;aid of a Gleet; and al&s;o in the Fir&s;t Chapter of the Practical Scheme above|mentioned concerning a Gonorrhaea. So that a <HI>Gleet,</HI> which is commonly tho mo&s;t improperly called a Gonorrhaea, is in reality nothing but only a dripping or owzing away of that mucous &s;limy Liquor, &s;eparated by the Glands in the Urethra for the lubrication of it, as has been above fully &s;aid, and generally &s;peaking, free from any Venereal Infection: So that a Per&s;on may have a <HI>Gleet</HI> upon them a con&s;iderable time without being &s;o vi&s;ibly emaciated and weakened as they wou'd be in a very &s;mall time by a Simple Gonorrhaea: Tho' neverthele&s;s, to let a Gleet run on from Year to Year as many do, without &s;eeking a Re|medy for it, is a mo&s;t certain Means to bring on a Con|&s;umption, as hereafter will be &s;hewed.</P>
<P>A Simple Gonorrhaea is cau&s;ed by Falls, Strains, lifting too great a Weight, Wre&s;tling, violent Riding, Running, Jumping, carrying of heavy Burdens, &amp;c. and is &s;o very difficult an Infirmity to Cure, as oftentimes to be even in|curable. But as for a <HI>Gleet,</HI> 'tis only after Venereal Cures, or &s;ome certain over-&s;trainings and Self-abu&s;es, too much or unskilful Purging, &amp;c. In&s;omuch that through a very great weakne&s;s and relaxation of the Orifices of the Glands in the Urethra from the above-mentioned Cau&s;es, a great many Per&s;ons have been left with &s;eeming incu|rable Gleets upon them, tho' under the Care of other|wi&s;e reputed ingenious Men in their Profe&s;&s;ion: For which Rea&s;on it is, that few Per&s;ons get clear of a Clap without more or le&s;s of a Gleet.</P>
<P>From what has hitherto been &s;aid, it appears that the true Seat of a &s;imple Gonorrhaea is in the &s;eminal Ve&s;&s;els: Whereas the Seat of a virulent Running and a Gleet is in no other Part than the Urethra, as fully has already been &s;hewed, and al&s;o in the Fir&s;t Chapter of the Practical Scheme. And 'tis for want of a true di&s;tinction in this Point that &s;o many People are ruined by improper Appli|cations, from an erroneous Notion of the Seat of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Moreover, be&s;ides the above-mentioned cau&s;es of a
<PB N="21" REF="21">Simple Gonorrhaea; an efflux of Matter very much re&s;em|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing it frequently follows from the Pro&s;tate Glands them|&s;elves, having been in a manner &s;o worn, as to be almo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aten, fretted, and corroded away; or at lea&s;t have been extreamly relaxed and debilitated by their being &s;o conti|nually ulcerated as they frequently are in many Patients under Cure for the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e: Or if not this, they at lea&s;t have been ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much heated and di&s;tended by re|peated &s;trong Purgations; by which means the Tone of the Parts had been &s;o relaxed and de&s;troyed, as to cau&s;e a thin &s;eminal Matter almo&s;t continually to flow away from the Urethra, which Fluxion, tho' commonly called a Gleet, yet in rigour 'tis a kind of a &s;imple Gonorrhaea, and is frequently the con&s;equence and re&s;ult of prepo|&s;terous management and ill fini&s;hed Cures.</P>

<P>THe&s;e are Infirmities I &s;hould here take no Notice of, if it were not for the &s;ake of a great many Vir|tuous Per&s;ons labouring under them, who to be&s;ure will &s;end for this little Book in expectation of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from it, and in hopes thereby to avoid the Shock of di&s;covering and making known tho&s;e Ailments to others which mo&s;t who labour under them u&s;e their utmo&s;t diligence to Screen and Hide: That therefore this pre&s;ent little Tract may not be defective, but fully an&s;wer whatever can be expected from its Title: The&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es being in|conveniences which altho &s;ome Women are more &s;ubject to then others, yet at &s;ome time or another &s;o ma|ny labour under them, that &s;carce any are wholly exempt from them: And what is &s;till wor&s;e, out of &s;uch great Numbers as are afflicted with them, very few ever get a true and &s;olid Cure, either thro a difficulty in them&s;elves to di&s;cover 'em: Or a neglect of their Cure, by thinking them trivial Infirmities, which time will Cure, without con&s;idering the ill con&s;equences they will produce: Or for want of Judgment in tho&s;e that undertake their Cure, they thro a ba&s;hfulne&s;s of di&s;covering their Ca&s;e to Per|&s;ons of Skill, con&s;ult only &s;uch who&s;e knowledge reaches no farther then <HI>Turpentine Pills, Bole Armenick</HI> &amp; <HI>A&s;trin|gents, Arch-Angel, Clary</HI> and other &s;uch like things, as in&s;ignificant to many, as the Judgment was defective that pre&s;cribed them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here therefore take Notice, That the Imper|fections
<PB N="22" REF="22">ob&s;ervable in mo&s;t Accounts of the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es (for by this Name of WEAKNESS, I &s;hall always for Decency &s;ake throughout this Chapter mean the Subject it treats of) hitherto publi&s;hed, and the &s;hocking expre&s;&s;i|ons in de&s;cribing them, have induced me to &s;ay &s;ome thing on this &s;ubject, which I'll endeavour to do in &s;uch a man|ner as may lead tho&s;e of my Readers to whom this Chap|ter only belongs, into a true knowledge of their State, and Method of its Cure, with as little Information to others not concerned in it (I mean the Men) as po&s;&s;ibly the Subject will admit of.&mdash;The&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es are of much the &s;ame Nature as <HI>Gleets</HI> in Men: For as the abovementioned re|laxed and weakned Mucous Glands in the <HI>Urethra</HI> or <HI>Uri|nary Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> &s;eparate and di&s;charge that Matter which con&s;titutes a GLEET in Men; &s;o (ob&s;erving a requi&s;ite Proportion) other Cervical Glandules or &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame Nature proportionably in the Neck of the Womb in Women, and de&s;igned for much the &s;ame U&s;e of lubri|cating it, &s;eparates &amp; di&s;charges al&s;o the Matter of the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es; So that the&s;e Glandules being rendred Weak, Lax, and Loo&s;e, &amp; thereby deprived of their natural due Tone and Springyne&s;s, either from the ill Con&s;titution of the Stomach, and a Sero&s;ity or Crude Chyle in the Ma&s;s of Blood, depraved by Di&s;tempers, or &s;ome ill Accidents, by which Means tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els cannot &s;ufficiently retain the proper Humor &s;eparated by them from the Blood, for much the &s;ame u&s;e proportionably as in Men, <HI>viz.</HI> to Lubricate or Moi&s;ten the Pa&s;&s;age tho for another end, but let it Gleet thus involuntarily and &s;lide away. And altho Women being of a more cold and moi&s;t Habit of Body then Men; &amp; on that account, &amp; &s;ome others more liable to be afflicted with the&s;e WEAKNESSES then Men are with Gleets: Yet a Gleet in Men, and the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es in Women are oftentimes one &amp; the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e, &amp; owe their Origin very often to the &s;ame Cau&s;es, which gene|rally in Men are Venereal ones, tho not always &s;o in Women: but &s;ometimes Hard and Difficult Labours, Colds or Hurts in Lying in, e&s;pecially in weak and di&s;|ea&s;ed Habits of Body, and many other Accidents which attend the Sex. But to &s;peak the Truth: Gleets in Men mo&s;t commonly owe their beginning to the Se|cret Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;o &s;ometimes does al&s;o the&s;e Weak|ne&s;&s;es in Women; the Infection of which having been car|ried
<PB N="23" REF="23">off, the Eibres in the O&s;tiola or Excretory Ducts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Glands &s;o often abovementioned, are not ea&s;ily re&s;to|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in either Sex, to their pri&s;tine Tone, Strength, and Vigour, but will remain relaxed and weak: From whence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Weeping or Dripping properly called a Gleet in Men, and Weakne&s;&s;es in Women, will, (e&s;pecially in an ill ha|bit of Body) for a long time after remain; unle&s;s proper Mea&s;ures be taken for a Cure.</P>
<P>From what has been hitherto &s;aid plainly appears what a Simple Gonorrhaea (which very &s;eldom happens) and what a Gleet in Men; and what Weakne&s;&s;es in Wo|men are (which are very common Infirmities.) They are all (generally &s;peaking) free from any Infection, &amp; can never (let Practitioners &s;ay what they plea&s;e to fright timorous Patients) degenerate into the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es as well as Gleets in Men are generally e&s;teem'd very hard to Cure, and &s;o indeed frequently they are, but if proper Mea&s;ures and Means be but taken; both Men &amp; Women, may in a competent time, and with|out much inconvenience be freed from the&s;e trouble|&s;ome and di&s;agreeable Companions, e&s;pecially to Neat and Cleanly Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>There are few Women e&s;pecially of the Weaker Sort, but at one time or other are aflicted with the&s;e Weak|ne&s;&s;es, they being an Infirmity often attendant upon, and cau&s;ed by concomitant or preceeding Di&s;tempers: In&s;o|much that generally &s;peaking whatever Di&s;ea&s;e reduces a Woman to a languid weakly State, it is commonly &s;ucceeded by this Indi&s;po&s;ition: For which Rea&s;on Women that are naturally of a more weak Con&s;titution or Habit of Body than ordinary, are more &s;ubject to the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es than others.</P>
<P>Some Women indeed have the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es much more moderate than others, and not continually, but at certain Times only, without cau&s;ing any great or remarkable Pro&s;tration of Strength 'till after a Year or 2 or more: But then it becomes more violent and dan|gerous, weakning the Body exce&s;&s;ively, and is then much more hard to cure. This being a known and un|doubted Truth, that the longer the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es have afflicted the Patient, and the larger in Quantity they are, the longer Time will be required, and the more difficult will it be, to accompli&s;h the Cure, the Hu|mors
<PB N="24" REF="24">being more habituated to come away, and the Glandules in the Ve&s;&s;els more weakned and &s;poiled.</P>
<P>It is equally as hard a matter as it is u&s;eful for a Phy&s;ician &s;ometimes to di&s;tingui&s;h well between the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es and other Di&s;tempers which re&s;emble them, their Con&s;equences and their Cure being widely dif|ferent: For Numbers of Women who have met with ill Husbands, have labour'd under the Venereal or Se|cret Di&s;ea&s;e for &s;ome Years together, &s;till imagining it to be that Weakne&s;s this pre&s;ent Chapter treats of.</P>
<P>Thus it being very difficult for Women to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e Di&s;tempers, and yet ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould, it may (generally &s;peaking,) be done by this Rule of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> which altho' for Decency &s;ake I &s;hall be very cautious in expre&s;&s;ing, yet tho&s;e Per&s;ons to whom this Chapter belongs, and is de&s;ign'd for, will &s;ufficiently comprehend. The Rule is this. That the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es, of which this pre&s;ent Chapter Treats, cea&s;es in Women at certain Periodical Times, and do not trouble them 'till &s;uch Times are over. Whereas a Venereal Running remains con&s;tantly upon the Patient, and does nor cea&s;e at any Time.</P>
<P>Many are the deplorable Ill Effects of the&s;e Weak|ne&s;&s;es, (the unhappy Companion of Womankind) if not in time remedied; but as this Subject s more pro|per for the following Chapter, where I &s;hall treat at large of the ill Con&s;equences of the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es, I &s;hall refer my Readers to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI <HI>Of the Ill Con&s;equences and Effects of</HI> Gleets, <HI>and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Great many Per&s;ons not knowing, or at lea&s;t not reflecting, and con&s;idering the ill Con&s;equences of <HI>Gleets</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es, look upon them as trivial Infirmities which Time and Patience will Cure: Whereas, altho' at pre&s;ent, the&s;e Infirmities may give no other unea&s;ine&s;s or trouble than what is oppo&s;ite to Neat|ne&s;s and Cleanline&s;s, being no grateful Companions to a clean neat Man, yet by their continuance greatly em|pair the Health, by wa&s;ting the Body, and bringing it into a vi&s;ible Con&s;umption. The rea&s;on of which is: A <HI>Gleet</HI> may in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and not improperly be com|pared to an I&s;&s;ue, which &s;eems as a Receptacle for the Hu|mors of the whole Body, but more e&s;pecially of the
<PB N="25" REF="25">adjacent Parts to run to; &s;o that Per&s;ons who have a <HI>Gleet,</HI> or any other like Weakne&s;s upon them, have there|by a con&s;tant Drain to their Body, which as has been al|ready &s;hewed, by a continual di&s;charge of that Matter which comes away, not only exhau&s;ts it of that Mucous Liquor, which is a &s;trength and &s;upport to the Parts where a <HI>Gleet</HI> is &s;ituated, but al&s;o draws away thereby a con&s;tant &s;upply of tho&s;e other Juices, wherein the Vi|gor and Strength of the Con&s;titution con&s;i&s;ts: The rea|&s;on of which is, that near the&s;e Parts both of Men and Women, there are certain Emunctories placed, who&s;e u&s;e is to receive the &s;uperfluous Humors or Recre|ments of the whole Body, and di&s;charge them thro' the genital Parts: So that the greater this di&s;charge of Hu|mors is, the more are the Parts not only weakn'd by it, &amp; the more ince&s;&s;antly &amp; plentifully do the&s;e Humors flow, but al&s;o the Nutritious Juices de&s;tined to the nouri&s;h|ment and &s;upport of the Neighbouring Parts, flows down with it, and are evacuated. So that at length by rea&s;on of this lo&s;s of the Nutritious Juice, which flowing to the &s;ame Place, is al&s;o corrupted and continually &s;ent away, not only Weakne&s;s and Pains, together with a Pining and Wa&s;ting of the neighbouring Parts, but of the whole Body does &s;ucceed, from a poor weak and di&s;|pirited Chyle the Blood abounds with. And to this Cau&s;e it is, that the greate&s;t part of Broken and decay'd Con&s;titutions are owing. But as I have treated at large on this Subject of Spoiled and Broken Con&s;titutions by Fa&s;t Living, former ill Cures, Salivations, and Mercury in the 3d Chapter of my <HI>Practical Scheme,</HI> to be had GRATIS where this Book is Given away; I &s;hall not repeat that Subject here, but refer my Reader to it.</P>
<P>The Body therefore being thus emptied and drained of tho&s;e Nutritious Juices, which in healthy, hail, &s;ound Per&s;ons, are its &s;upport: In length of time ex|ce&s;&s;ive Pains and Weakne&s;s, e&s;pecially in the Loins and &s;mall of the Back, en&s;ues; together with a debility and weakne&s;s in the Nerves and Joints, Pale, Faint and livid Looks, e&s;pecially about the Eyes, Melancholy, lo&s;s of Appetite, decay of Spirits and Strength, a re|markable Wearyne&s;s over the whole Body, &s;welling in the Legs, and an univer&s;al decay of Strength.</P>
<P>So that the&s;e Symptoms not &s;toping in time, (as mo&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="26">Per&s;ons in the begining deceive them&s;elves they will, fancing a <HI>Gleet</HI> to be an incon&s;iderable Thing, and that it will wear off of it &s;elf, in proce&s;s of Time) they in|crea&s;e, and are followed al&s;o by others, as an almo&s;t con|tinual Thir&s;t, a hectical Di&s;po&s;ition, Atrophy, and wa&s;t|ing of Fle&s;h, till at length the Body is &s;o drained, as to be brought into the highe&s;t degree of a Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>All which Symptoms are occa&s;ioned by the great lo&s;s of the Mucous Liquor of the Glands, which being thus weakned and relaxed, have their Meatus's or openings &s;o widened, and loo&s;ened, as not be able to re&s;train the Flux or dripping away of the Matter, whereby the withering of the whole Body, with a dryne&s;s and Sicci|ty of the Nerves and Nervous Juices mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in a &s;hort time en&s;ue.</P>

<P>It remains now to &s;peak a Word or two of the ill ef|fects and con&s;equences of Weakne&s;&s;es in Women, as I have already done of <HI>Gleets</HI> in Men, as I promi&s;ed above in the foregoing Chapter. Since therefore what I have already &s;aid in this Chapter, is to be proportionably ap|plied to Women: The Effects of the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es are Pains in the &s;mall of the Back and Head, want of Ap|petite, bad Dige&s;tion, Wearine&s;s, and Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, &s;ome|times &s;wellings of the Legs, pale livid Countenance. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And as this Evil is mo&s;tly occa&s;ioned by foregoing Di|&s;tempers, (tho al&s;o &s;ometimes by &s;udden Frights, violent Exerci&s;e, irregular Living, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) &s;o it weakens the Body al&s;o more and more, bringing the whole human Frame into a pining de&s;perate State, unle&s;s cured by proper Remedies skillfully admini&s;tred in time, no evil in the World, that u&s;ually happens to Women, being of &s;o very ill con&s;equence to the Looks, Complexion, Mind, Ha|bit, Strength, and whole Body as this.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch that if this great Evil (which too often proves the BANE and Ruin of Woman kind) be not timely remedied, it certainly cau&s;es either untimely Bar|renne&s;s, or if they have Children, they are weak, infirm, and di&s;ea&s;ed, and the Blood and Juices become more and

<P>THE De&s;ign of this Chapter being to &s;hew how every Per&s;on that has received an Injury, and been under Cure for it, may know whether the Malignity be wholy carried off or not: And if there be any Running or Gleeting &s;till remaining afterwards, whether it proceeds from any Secret Infection &s;till lurking behind, or from Medicines taken for a Cure, or from a natural Weak|ne&s;s of the Parts, which &s;ome Per&s;ons from a more then ordinary delicacy and tenderne&s;s of Con&s;titution are lia|ble to, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t Care both of them|&s;elves, and the Per&s;on under who&s;e Hands they were during their Cure; My Reader is to take notice, that af|ter a due evacuation and clearing of the Body of the Venereal Infection, the mattery running which before was Yellowi&s;h, Green or Bloody, loo&s;es by Degrees both it's colour and quantity, and comes at la&s;t to a perfect Whitene&s;s or Tran&s;parency, re&s;embling very much the white of an Egg, and is Slimy, Mucilaginous, and Ropy; and the Parts are ea&s;y and cool: All which are admirable Signs, and the &s;tronge&s;t Pre&s;umption that the Malignity is carried off, and the Per&s;on cured and well. But &s;ince it frequently al&s;o happens that a Per&s;on may be &s;aid to be (not ill) cured, altho' the&s;e &s;igns of a good Cure, may not be altogather &s;o very perfect as here they are de&s;cribed to be, we mu&s;t examin this matter &s;till a little farther, for the full Satisfaction of the mo&s;t timorous of my Readers.</P>
<P>It has indeed been a common Opinion that in <HI>Gleets,</HI> when the Matter that comes away is &s;till di&s;couloured being either yellowi&s;h or green, that it is a certain Sign, (and indeed an only one) of a remaining Infection, and an imperfect or ill Cure. 'Tis true, that when the Matter that comes away in a <HI>Gleet,</HI> or other &s;uch Weak|ne&s;s, is not di&s;couloured at all, but is pure White, Glu|tinous
<PB N="28" REF="28">and Ropy, and the Parts in all re&s;pects entirely cool and ea&s;y, there is no difficulty to pronounce &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Per&s;on entirely free from Infection, &amp; (not ill) cured; be|cau&s;e if there were any Infection and Malignity &s;till re|maining behind, the&s;e &s;igns would not be &s;o perfect a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> here I &s;uppo&s;e them to be: But yet for all this, it is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> always a certain &s;ign and con&s;equence of either an actua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> lurking Infection, or a former ill Cure, when even the&s;e &s;igns are not &s;o very perfect. The rea&s;on of this is; that in &s;ome Habits of Body the Owzing Matter which con|&s;titutes a <HI>Gleet</HI> will in &s;ome length of time, and in di&s;|ea&s;ed habits of Body, in its Separation from the Blood be &s;o permixt with &s;ome certain Corro&s;ive (but not at all Venereal) Particles, as thereby to be &s;o colliquat|ed and altered in it's Texture and Cohe&s;ion of it's con|&s;tituent Parts, as to appear a &s;ort of Pus, Sanies or Matter &s;omething di&s;coloured, that will very much re|&s;emble the Relicks and Remains of a Venereal Infection, or an ill Cure: And if a Per&s;on &s;hould think to change this Colour by Purging, one might, as Dr <HI>Harvey</HI> ob&s;erves, Purge a Per&s;on's Life away as &s;oon as change either it's Colour, or cau&s;e it's entire Abatement. So that the Pra|ctitioner imagining that all yellowi&s;h Runnings are malignant (which is a vulgar Error) goes on &s;till in hopes of changing it, 'till at length the Parts are &s;o weakned, that the Poor Patient has a <HI>Gleet</HI> fixt upon him, and thereby rendred wor&s;e in&s;tead of better, and perhaps at la&s;t told they are incurable.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the Truth of this, it is to be ob&s;erved that the imprudent Continuation of Venereal Catharticks, rather keeps on the yellowne&s;s of the Running then abates it, by keeping up the humors in a con&s;tant Fer|ment and Ebullition, and thereby inflaming and frothing them up into a yellow Bilous Spume or Scum, which is daily &s;eparated in the Parts, that are now become as it were a Ci&s;tern, to which Cu&s;tom has made an open Chan|nel, and converted the Orifice of the Urethra into (as it were) an I&s;&s;ue, to which the depraved humors of the Body, and e&s;pecially of the adjacent Parts flow: And which humors, as the Blood (even in very well cured Per&s;ons) is tinctured with Choler, and depraved and altered by a long Cour&s;e of Phy&s;ick, do al&s;o pro|portionably partake more or le&s;s of a yellowi&s;h Colour.
<PB N="29" REF="29">Hence it plainly appears, that &s;ome Returns of yel|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wi&s;h &s;mall Runnings after &s;ome Cures of the <HI>Secret &s;ea&s;e</HI> do not always indicate any remaining Infection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lay any blame or a&s;per&s;ion upon the former Cure; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is yellowne&s;s frequently owing it's origin to the yel|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow Liquors of the Blood.

This is not only in Rea&s;on po&s;&s;ible, but what we find true by daily experience, in Ulcers and common Sores, from whence a yellowi&s;h Matter will flow, owing it's colour purely to the bilous part of the Blood, &s;eparated and &s;ecerned by the adjacent Glands. Hence as Dr. <HI>Cockburn,</HI> takes notice, it fre|quently happens that virulent Runnings in Per&s;ons who have the <HI>Secret Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> actually upon them have been cur|ed, when the yellowne&s;s has continued to the la&s;t Drop; which could not be, if the yellowne&s;s were always a part, or mark of the Contagion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Of the mo&s;t Rational and True Method of Cure of</HI> Gleets, Simple Gonorrhaeas, <HI>and other &s;uch Weak|ne&s;&s;es in either Sex, proceeding from former Cures,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have endeavoured hitherto demon&s;tratively to deduce the Seat and Nature of a <HI>Gleet,</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es from it's Symptoms, and the Anatomi|cal Structure of the Part it affects, without engaging in any of the Hypothe&s;es of the Ancients; &s;o I'll now endeavour to draw &s;uch con&s;equences from the Nature of the Infirmity thus di&s;covered, which will prove the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atisfactory Cour&s;e that can be taken to arrive at the mo&s;t exact ways of curing it; e&s;pe|cially &s;ince the common Methods of Cure of late Years in Practice, are found from their want of Succe&s;s not &s;ufficiently grounded on Rea&s;on and Experience. It be|ing a manife&s;t truth, that the be&s;t Methods of Cure are always taken from a <HI>Rational</HI> Notion of the Nature and Cau&s;e of a Di&s;ea&s;e: Human <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> being never of grea|ter u&s;e in any part of human Life, then it is in the Practice of Phy&s;ick. For as Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> &s;ays in the Preface
<PB N="30" REF="30">to his E&s;&s;ays on Poi&s;ons, He alone is the mo&s;t likely Per|&s;on to Cure any ailment or di&s;order in a human Body, who be&s;t under&s;tands the human Oconomy, the Tex|ture of the Parts, the Motions of the Fluids, and by con&s;equence the Source and <HI>Origin</HI> of the Di&s;order, ac|cording to that of Cel&s;us, <HI>Recte Curaturum, quem prima origo Cau&s;ae non fefellerit.</HI> Having therefore above in the &s;econd and following Chapters, clearly accounted for the mo&s;t Rational Cau&s;e of <HI>Gleets,</HI> Simple <HI>Gonorrhaeas</HI> and other Weakne&s;&s;es, the &s;ubject Matter of this pre|&s;ent Treati&s;e: I hope al&s;o as clearly now to &s;hew the mo&s;t Rational Method of their Cure: As follows:</P>
<P><HI>In omnibus contrarietas Remedio e&s;t,</HI> is an Aphori&s;m of the great Hippocrates, and holds good in the Cure of our pre|&s;ent Infirmity, as well as in the Cure of any other par|ticular di&s;order of the Body what&s;oever. In&s;omuch that if there be a Heat and Inflammation in any Part, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to tho&s;e things that are Cooling. In cold Di&s;ea&s;es to warm Medicines. If any Humor is &s;harp and corro&s;ive, it mu&s;t be reduced to a due degree of &s;oftne&s;s by mollifying Medicines. If any parts are injured, and weakned, &s;trengthning, healing and Bal&s;amick ones mu&s;t be made u&s;e of before ever a Cure can be effected, in order to re&s;tore the debilita|ted Parts to their fir&s;t Tone and Vigour. So that in our pre&s;ent Infirmity which we have now before us, we find from what has been hitherto &s;aid, the following ob&s;tacle, and which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be removed before ever we can hope to rein&s;tate the Patient, <HI>viz.</HI> &mdash; The openings of the Mucous Glands &s;o often abovemention|ed in the Urethra being weakned, loo&s;ned, and relax|ed by the above mentioned Cau&s;es, are thereby become flabby, limber and loo&s;e, which before in a &s;ound State were &s;pringy, vigorous and &s;trong; &s;o that by this means the <HI>O&s;tiola</HI> or Mouths of them being deprived of their natural Power of (in &s;ome mea&s;ure proportionable at lea&s;t to their bigne&s;s,) contracting and drawing them|&s;elves together after every Emi&s;&s;ion of that Mucous &s;limy Liquor they contain, are by con&s;equence always open, by which means this Liquor is continually owz|ing out from them and coming away. This being the true &s;tate of our pre&s;ent Que&s;tion, and the rational Ob|&s;tacle we have now to encounter with, as &s;ufficiently
<PB N="31" REF="31">appears from what has been above &s;aid: 'Tis natural to conclude, that the only true and rational Method of Cure of <HI>Gleets,</HI> and any other Weakne&s;&s;es of the &s;ame kind whether in Men or Women, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t, in one word for all, without any manner of Eva&s;ion or going round the Bu&s;h, in affecting the very Place it &s;elf from whence the dripping Liquor is di&s;charged; and this is done by STRENGTHNING the&s;e Glands, and there|by re&s;toring their Openings and Mouths to their former power of contracting, and con&s;tringing them&s;elves after every Emi&s;&s;ion of the Mucous Liquor they contain; by which means a certain Bar and Hindrance will be put to their di&s;charging more of it, then is wi&s;ely in|tended by Nature, as ju&s;t enough for the lubrication and moi&s;tening of the Pa&s;&s;age and no more, and for which end alone &s;he has de&s;igned it. This being once effected, ju&s;t &s;o much and no more of this Liquor will afterwards proceed from the&s;e Glands, as ju&s;t the defence of the Urethra requires as a Pre&s;ervative a|gain&s;t the &s;harpne&s;s and &s;altne&s;s of the Urine as it pa&s;&s;es thro: it being an e&s;tabli&s;hed Maxim in Philo&s;ophy, That upon the removal of any Cau&s;e, the effect pre|&s;ently cea&s;es. So that wherever the Cau&s;e lies, <HI>That</HI> mu&s;t be applied to, before ever we can expect the effects to cea&s;e. But how to bring this about, <HI>Hic Labor, hoc Opus e&s;t,</HI> it's Re&s;idence being in a part which Nature &s;eems particularly to have affected the concealment.</P>
<P>Hence my Reader may plainly &s;ee, that the great difficulty which has now puzled &s;o many Ages in the Cure of <HI>Gleets</HI> and other &s;uch &s;orts of Weakne&s;&s;es, is all (from only a few evidently demon&s;trable Principles above e&s;tabli&s;hed) reduceable, to one only &s;ingle inten|tion of Cure, <HI>viz.</HI> to Strengthen the&s;e Glands. 'Tis no wonder then that the Ancients found &s;uch difficulty in this matter, as after all po&s;&s;ible endeavours &s;ometimes to leave their Patients at be&s;t only <HI>in &s;tatu quo;</HI> tho' in rigour this may be very much doubted, it being pretty certain that neither the continuance of a <HI>Gloet,</HI> nor any of the common Methods of its Cure, have been ever as yet found to improve a Con&s;titution, or to change it, otherwi&s;e, then from a &s;trong to a weaker one.</P>
<P>Our next Enquiry then mu&s;t be, how this Intention of Cure is to be brought about and effected with the
<PB N="32" REF="32">greate&s;t Ea&s;e and Security to the Patient, and what t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nature of tho&s;e Medicines mu&s;t be that can perform i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> In order to which we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that &s;ince <HI>Glee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> procced from the Mucous Glands in the Urethra, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the contiguous Parts being particularly weakned thro' long Continuance of the Secret Di&s;ea&s;e, and its Cure Repeated Self-Abu&s;es <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Intention of Cure mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;i&s;t in Strengthning and Contracting the&s;e relaxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Glands and Parts adjacent, and thereby re&s;tore them t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their former natural State of Vigour and Soundne&s;s, af|ter having been thus injured, and debilitated either by the Di&s;temper, or its Cure, Reiterated Self-Abu&s;es, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other what&s;oever Cau&s;es. And for want of &s;uch a Me|thod as this 'tis, that a great many Per&s;ons (altho, o|therwi&s;e perfectly well) come to have &s;eemingly incure|able <HI>Gleets</HI> fixt and entailed upon them. For which rea|&s;on it is that a <HI>Gleet</HI> is always more or le&s;s difficult to Cure, as it is of greater or le&s;s Continuance, or is occa|&s;ioned by more or le&s;s Frequent &s;elf Abu&s;es, or a more or le&s;s virulent Humor which gave the preceeding Infect|ion; by every one of which cau&s;es the <HI>Glands</HI> are always more or le&s;s &s;tretched, weakned and debilitated</P>
<P>The Method then I here aim at in the Cure of our pre&s;ent Infirmities, is by &s;uch Medicines as are appropria|ted in a peculiar manner, and by a Singular Specifick qua|lity, Influence, and tendency to the Injured and debilitated Glands in the Urethra and parts adjacent chiefly above any other Part or Parts of the Body what&s;oever, and thereby not only &s;o to act upon and affect THEM in particular as to &s;trengthen clo&s;e and con&s;tringe their Mouths and Orifices, but al&s;o to pre&s;erve them hereafter in this &s;ound State. So that the&s;e Glands being ree&s;ta|bli&s;hed by this Method of Cure, their acquired Vigour will enable them to re&s;i&s;t any future ingre&s;s of fa&s;ter &s;up|plies of the Matter they &s;eparate and &s;ecerne, then is ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and no more for the moi&s;tening and lubrica|tion of the Urethra, and &s;o turning them off to be di&s;charged by Nature another way. So that whil&s;t the Ancients were Trifling with <HI>Their</HI> long tedious and un|certain Methods of Cure, Wonders are performed by <HI>This.</HI> Be&s;ides, this Method of Cure &s;ucceeding to the Satisfaction of the Patient, is a &s;trong Confirmation of the Truth of the Theory above e&s;tabli&s;hed: Whereas
<PB N="33" REF="33"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the other hand, mo&s;t other Methods formerly prac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;edby the Ancients, either did not &s;ucceed at at, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f at any time they did, it was not 'till after a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong while.</P>
<P>From what has been hitherto &s;aid, it plainly appears that this our Method of Cure is not only effectual in Men, but will be found upon Tryal to be inferiour to few, for tho&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es mentioned above in the 4th Chap. in Women.</P>
<P>I will not here trouble my Readers in proving that in Nature there are &s;ome certain Medicines which being taken into the Stomach, will immediately tend towards and make their Way to, &s;ome one particular part of the Body <HI>Electively</HI> and preferably to any other: Having fully cleared that Difficulty in the 8th, 9th, and 10th Chapters of the 3d Edition of My New SYSTEM of the GOUT and RHEUMATISM, to be had Gratis where this Book is Given away. I de&s;ire them therefore to read tho&s;e Chapters, wherein I have clearly &s;hewn how Medicines by a particular Specifick Quality they are endowed with, will (being taken into the Stomach) tend to and have an influence over &s;ome one peculiar Part of the Body, which they are de&s;igned particularly to relieve, rather then any other, as is there clearly &s;hewed in Medicines appropriated to the Cure of the GOUT. All which I hope will fully convince any Per|&s;on of the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Strengthning Re&s;torative Me|dicine's being taken into the Stomach, and from thence to tend towards and make it's way (by means of the Bloods Circulation) immediately to that Part in particu|lar above any other in the Body what&s;oever, which is the true Seat of a <HI>Gleet,</HI> I mean the Urethra or Urinary Pa&s;&s;age. This Point therefore being fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e Chapters of the abovementioned Sy&s;tem, I'll &s;ay nothing more of that Subject here, but refer my Reader to the peru&s;al of that Book, which he may have for only Asking for, at the Places abovementioned where this Book is Given away.</P>
<P>As to the Change of the Colour of the <HI>Gleet,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ince it generally proceeds as above has been &s;aid from a mixture of Choler, Bile, Gall, and &s;everal Impurities with the Blood, by con&s;equence to clean&s;e and Rectifie the ill Cra&s;is of <HI>This,</HI> will effectually change the ill Co|lour
<PB N="34" REF="34">of <HI>That.</HI> Care therefore mu&s;t be taken that al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Strengthning Medicines that are made u&s;e of in the Cure of <HI>Gleets,</HI> be al&s;o endowed with a certain detergent Fa|culty, by which they may in their pa&s;&s;age to tho&s;e Parts they are chiefly de&s;igned for, &s;o Clean&s;e, Sweeten and Purify the Blood, as at the &s;ame time that they Streng|then the Glands in the Urethra, they may al&s;o change the Colour of the Liquor the&s;e Glands contain: And by thus changing of it's ill Colour, it's Sub&s;tance if too thin will al&s;o <HI>&s;ecundario</HI> &amp; <HI>per accidens</HI> be changed at the &s;ame time. For &s;ince whenever the Matter Dripping &amp; Owzing away in <HI>Gleets</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es is too thin, it proceeds from its being Colliquated (and if I may u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion as it were in a manner melted down and Liquid) by tho&s;e Impurities which are mix|ed and blended with it out of the Ma&s;s of Blood: The&s;e Impurities and Foulne&s;&s;es being once clean&s;ed out of the Blood, the Mucous &s;limy Matter will naturally re|a&s;&s;ume again its own natural Tenacious and Glutinous Con&s;i&s;tence, as it has in <HI>Statu &s;ano.</HI></P>
<P>My Reader perhaps will ask me whether or no this Method of Cure is proper in <HI>all &s;orts</HI> of <HI>Gleets</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es. To which I An&s;wer, that when a <HI>Gleet</HI> is purely &s;uch, and entirely free from any Relicks or Re|mains of former Infection, the abovementioned Method of Cure is inferiour to few in the World. If therefore the <HI>Gleet</HI> or other &s;uch Weakne&s;s be what proceeds from a former Cured Injury, and that the Per&s;on had no man|ner of &s;uch Infirmity upon them before they received and were Cured of that Injury, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Patients &s;afety fir&s;t of all to be &s;atisfied, that there is no remaining Malignity attending it, which my Rea|der will &s;ufficiently be in&s;tructed in from what has been above &s;aid in the foregoing Chapter. But if Per&s;ons are any ways doubtful whether or no the <HI>Gleet</HI> may &s;till Par|take of any Preceeding Infection, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to clear the Body and by Con&s;equence the <HI>Gleet</HI> or any o|ther &s;uch Weakne&s;s of whatever former Infection it may be &s;till blended, and mixed with, lea&s;t in&s;tead of Cure|ing a Per&s;on of a <HI>Gleet,</HI> &s;omething of wor&s;e Con&s;e|quence be fixt and rivetted upon him. What therefore is mo&s;t proper for every &s;uch doubtfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Per&s;on to do previous to the Taking of the following <HI>Great Re&s;tora|tive</HI>

<P>Hence it appears that <HI>Gleets</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es are not &s;o difficult of Cure as a great many Per&s;ons make them to be, who after all their Endeavours to rid the Patients of them to no purpo&s;e, di&s;mi&s;s them at la&s;t with their Opinion that they'll never be cured, a&s;&s;uring them at the &s;ame time, it will never hurt them, &amp; that Nature at length will Wear and throw it off, and the like: Which a great many give Credit to, in hopes of finding it true, 'till time has made this Error too mani|fe&s;tly appear, for in&s;tead of Natures overcoming it, &amp; their finding no inconvenience by it, it has grown wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and proved at la&s;t &s;o very inconvenient, that the poor Patient has born it with no &s;mall Unea&s;yne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of a certain Strengthning Restorative Me|dicine for the Cure of Gleets and other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Learned Dr. <HI>Cockburn</HI> in his Treati&s;e of a <HI>Go|norrhaea,</HI> 2d <HI>Edition,</HI> pag. 210. lays this down for a general Rule in Phy&s;ick: <HI>Viz.</HI> That no Medicine is to be received for its &s;ingular U&s;e, 'till it has had many Try|als in proper Circum&s;tances; <HI>i. e.</HI> 'till it has been u&s;ed on a Number of People equally ill, or that it has its Effects, when no rea&s;onable hopes are left of a Cure by the be&s;t of other Medicines Skilfully admini&s;tred. Hence it is by con&s;equence to be concluded that when a Me|dicine has &s;hewed its Efficacy in the&s;e Circum&s;tances, it not only may, but even ought to be received by eve|ry Per&s;on &s;olicitous for their Health and Welfare.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="36">
<P>After therefore having proceeded thus far with this Treati&s;e, I &s;hould be injurious to my Readers thus to explicate the Origin, Cau&s;e, Symptoms, Effects, and ill Con&s;equences, together with the mo&s;t rational Method of Cure of their Infirmities, if I &s;hould leave them there, perhaps &s;omething Wi&s;er then they were before as to the ju&s;t now enumerated Heads, but not a bit the nearer to a Cure. In order then not to entertain them with meer Speculations, I'll endeavour to give them &s;ome Practical A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by propo&s;ing here to the World, a truly Great and Noble Remedy for tho&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es and Di&s;orders here treated of.</P>
<P>The Medicine I propo&s;e is a mo&s;t excellent <HI>Bal&s;amick Restorative,</HI> which for Recovering Nature in tho&s;e many Weakne&s;&s;es &s;o frequently abovementioned has not many equals. It being a mo&s;t Noble Strengthner in all Weak|ne&s;&s;es, whether from Hard Labours, Over-&s;trainings, Wrenches, Mi&s;carriages, Self-Abu&s;es, &amp; other Secret Injuries and their Cures, in either Sex. Its efficacy al&s;o reaches &s;till farther, being of admirable U&s;e to Cure Pains, Weakne&s;&s;es, and all Imbecilities of Nature, ei|ther in the Back, Reins, Loins, or el&s;ewhere; to re|move or take away any Stoppage of Urine, by effectu|ally and yet gently (as Nature &s;eems to defire) carrying off all Mucous, Filthy, Sanious and Infectious Matter Slime or Gravel lodged in the Reins, and el&s;ewhere by ill Cures or other Cau&s;es; &amp; which either produces a Sharpne&s;s in the Urine, or a too frequent Provocation to make it: And thereby recovers the lo&s;t Tone of the Seminal Ve&s;&s;els and Mucous Glands in the Urethra &s;o of|ten abovementioned. De&s;troying thereby all Relicks of Venereal Venom that lurking in the Body in&s;en&s;ibly wa&s;ts and decays the Fle&s;h and Strength.</P>
<P>And lea&s;t my Readers &s;hould &s;u&s;pect the po&s;&s;ibility of the Operation of a Medicine taken in at the Mouth, and from thence conveyed into the Stomach, on a Part &s;o remote from it, as that is which I have proved above in the 2d Chap. to be true, real, and indeed only Seat of a <HI>Gleet</HI> and other &s;uch Weakne&s;s: I mu&s;t refer them to what I have &s;aid on this Subject in the 9th &amp; 10th Chapters of my abovementioned Sy&s;tem of the GOUT &amp; <HI>Rheumati&s;m.</HI> In which Chapters is as clearly &s;hew|ed as &s;o Nice &amp; Intricate a Subject will admit from the Prin|ciples
<PB N="37" REF="37">of the Modern Philo&s;ophy, how 'tis very po&s;&s;ble for a Medicine to be taken in at the Mouth, and con|veyed into the Stomach, and from thence to be mixed with that Portion of the Ma&s;s of Blood which it finds circulating in the Ve&s;&s;els there, by which means of the Bloods Circulation it is &s;oon carried about the Body, &amp; by con&s;equence to That very individual part it is de&s;ign|ed to relieve: As is fully proved in tho&s;e Chapters of the ju&s;t now mentioned Sy&s;tem, of the Operation of the Anti-Arthritick Medicine there propo&s;ed to act upon even the very utmo&s;t and remote&s;t extremities of the Body, <HI>viz.</HI> Tho&s;e Joints which u&s;ually the Gout &s;eizes. I de&s;ire therefore my Readers, that &s;ince, they may have that <HI>System</HI> for only Asking for, they will be plea&s;ed to peru&s;e the 9th &amp; 10th Chapters of it, and apply them to this Subject, that I may not repeat the &s;ame Matter here over again. For as a Medicine taken for the Gout if it be a true and real <HI>Anti-Arthritick,</HI> never attempts to exert its principal Force of acting till it arrives along with the Blood, at the Glands of tho&s;e very Joints it is de&s;igned to relieve; ju&s;t &s;o the Great <HI>Restorative</HI> and Stengthing Medicine I here propo&s;e, being taken a few Drops of it, in a little Wine, Ale, or Beer, is thereby carried down into the Stomach, from whence it mixes it &s;elf (being of a Spirituous Volatil Nature) with the Ma&s;s of Blood, and is carried with it about the Body, and among other Parts, to that which is the true Seat of tho&s;e Infirmities here treated of. Being arrived there by a particular Specifick influence it bears over, &amp; Ten|dency to that Part above any other, and the Mucous Glands contained in it, it there begins to exert its force and to operate, by Strengthning, Healing, and Re&s;to|ring the Mouths and O&s;tiola of tho&s;e little Glands, to their former Ela&s;ticity, Springyne&s;s and Vigour, by which means they will naturally again recover that Power they formerly had of Con&s;tringing them&s;elves as naturally they ought to do after every Emi&s;&s;ion of the Mucous &s;limy Liquor they Contain, and which Nature has wi&s;ely de&s;igned for the Lubrication of the Pa&s;&s;age, as has &s;ufficiently been above explicated. This being once performed by this Great <HI>Re&s;torative</HI> Medicine, and the Mouths of the&s;e Glands being recovered from their loo&s;ene&s;s and flabbyne&s;s, to an Ela&s;tick Springy State, by
<PB N="38" REF="38">con&s;equence a Bar will thereby be put for the future, by which ju&s;t &s;o much and no more of this Mucous &s;li|my Liquor will be let out &amp; come away, then ju&s;t the Moi&s;tening &amp; Lu brication of the Pa&s;&s;age in a hail &s;ound &s;tate requires: By which means, a <HI>Gleet</HI> which perhaps for a long time has afflicted the Patient will be taken away, and the Parts re&s;tored to their former due &s;tate of Health and Strength.</P>
<P>The property of this great <HI>Re&s;torative</HI> is not only Traumatick, <HI>i. e.</HI> only to Heal and thereby to &s;trength|en the Mucous Glands in the Pa&s;&s;age and the Womb-Ve&s;&s;els, by gently &s;traitening them, and reducing them to their natural Tone, but al&s;o to deterge and clean&s;e them of whatever Filth they may by their Weakne&s;s have contracted, never di&s;ordering the Body, but keep|ing it in a due State. 'Tis not unplea&s;ant to take, &amp; being once received in a proper Vehicle as a Gla&s;s of Wine, Ale, Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into the Stomach, it (by means of the Bloods Circulation) di&s;plays its Vertues after a wonderful manner, effectually an&s;wering the intentions of Cure. Be&s;ides all which it is a very great purifier &amp; &s;weetner of the Blood and Juices, and thereby invigo|rates, enlivens, and &s;trengthens the whole Body, taking away Weakne&s;&s;es, and Pains in the Back, Loins, and el&s;ewhere, rendring the Per&s;on brisk, lively, healthy, and &s;trong, and puts an end to tho&s;e trouble&s;ome Com|panions commonly called <HI>Gleets,</HI> &amp; other &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>So that to a Per&s;on even never &s;o well in Health that &s;hould take of it, it will clean&s;e, &s;weeten, and purifie the Blood, and thereby wonderfully enliven, animate, &s;trengthen, and invigorate the whole Con&s;titution, but above all in a more particular manner then ordinary tho&s;e Parts which being hidden in the Body are too remote for any Manual Operation to act upon, as the Seminal &amp; Urinary Ve&s;&s;els, the Pro&s;tatae, Para&s;tatae, and Mucous Glands in the Urethra. This Noble <HI>Medicine</HI> being to be taken by Drops may be carried in the Pocket, and ta|ken as well abroad as at home, without any manner of unea&s;ine&s;s, trouble, &s;u&s;picion, or confinement, for Ex|ample at the Tavern, Coffee-Hou&s;e, or any other Pub|lick Place, by which means Gentlemen and others will be Cured in a manner in&s;en&s;ibly and before they are al|mo&s;t aware of it. Its Operation is principally by Urine,
<PB N="39" REF="39">but neverthele&s;s it will in mo&s;t Con&s;titutions &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature as to promote the having one Stool in about 24 Hours. Nothing does exceed this admirable Remedy in the abovementioned Ca&s;es, where either too much Purging has over relaxed and weakned the Tone of the Parts, or too free a u&s;e of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and other Pernici|ous methods of Cure have been made U&s;e of, re&s;toring the Body to a due State of health and Strength.</P>
<P>This Great <HI>Restorative</HI> in fine neat Bottles is Sealed up (with the Print of the Anodyne NECKLACE which the late Dr. <HI>Paul Chamberlen</HI> in his life time Recommen|ded for Childrens TEETH &s;o often abovemention|ed, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from any COUNTERFEIT) toge|ther with Printed Directions in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> for its U&s;e, &s;o clear, ea&s;y, full, and plain that Per&s;ons may Cure them&s;elves with it in any remote Country, Sea|&s;on, Climate, or Part of the World, (for if well Cor|ked it will not grow wor&s;e with keeping) Price a Guinea.
