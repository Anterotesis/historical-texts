<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE <HI>Harry</HI> was &s;peaking, <HI>Ned</HI> &s;aw a Woman &s;tanding before one of the Windows, and, look|ing earne&s;tly at her, he gave a &s;udden Jump, and, dancing about; cried, O Sir, Sir, my Mammy, my Mammy, my Mam|my!
<PB N="4" REF="3">there's my Mammy, there's my Mammy, as &s;ure as Day!</P>
<P>Run <HI>Ned,</HI> in&s;tantly, cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> and call <HI>James</HI> to me&mdash;<HI>James,</HI> yonder's the Woman who &s;tole <HI>Ned</HI> from his Parents, have an Eye to her, do not let her e&s;cape! Order <HI>Frank</HI> to take a Hor&s;e and go with all &s;peed to Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> that they may come and know, of a &s;urety, whether <HI>Ned</HI> is their Child or not&mdash;Stay a Moment; as &s;oon as you have given <HI>Frank</HI> his Orders, take the re&s;t of the Ser|vants and lay hold on this bad Woman, bring her into the Hou&s;e by Force, and con|fine her in one of the Back Rooms till Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> arrives. By all <HI>Ned</HI>'s Account, &s;he mu&s;t be a very &s;ad Creature, and de&s;erves no Favour.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> went out with Alacrity upon his Commi&s;&s;ion, and, having executed Matters with his accu&s;tomed Punctuality, he return|ed to the Company.</P>
<P>Law! Sir, cried <HI>James,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible that this Woman &s;hould be <HI>Ned</HI>'s Mammy as he called her. This is &s;ome unhappy decayed Gentlewoman, as innocent of the Fact, I dare an&s;wer, as the Child unborn. I am &s;orry, with all my Heart, that I had her u&s;ed &s;o roughly. Be&s;ide, Sir, &s;he is &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="4">deaf, that &s;he can't an&s;wer to any thing of which &s;he may be accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>When we took her in hand &s;he was ter|ribly frighted. Come, &s;ays I, Mi&s;tre&s;s, you mu&s;t now give an Account of all your Wickedne&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Ennis,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>Ennis?</HI> no but <HI>Enfield;</HI> five Miles beyond <HI>Enfield,</HI> with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI>&mdash;I know nothing, &s;aid I aloud, of your <HI>Enfields</HI> or your <HI>Catharines;</HI> but I tell you that you mu&s;t now an&s;wer for the Life that you have led. Dead, dead, &s;ays &s;he, God forbid! A dear and a good Ma&s;ter he was to me, I am &s;ure; I have lived with him the&s;e five Years; and he gave me Money enough to bear my Charges; but I fell &s;ick at <HI>Saint Alban</HI>'s and &s;pent all; and I have been the&s;e three Days creeping along, and begg|ing wherewithal to keep Life in me on the way.</P>
<P>As you &s;ay, <HI>James,</HI> cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> this Account &s;eems pretty fea&s;ible; a deaf Servant however is &s;omething uncommon; and yet I once knew a deaf and dumb Man the mo&s;t ready and apprehen&s;ive Attendant I ever &s;aw, he would in&s;tantly collect what|ever you wanted from the Motion of your Lips and the Ca&s;t of your Eye. Go to her your&s;elf, <HI>Ned,</HI> and ob&s;erve her more ex|actly; for, if what &s;he &s;ays has any Truth
<PB N="6" REF="5">in it, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould be your Mammy.</P>
<P><HI>Ned</HI> accordingly went, but returned un|der evident Confu&s;ion and Difficulty. I don't know what to think, Sir, of this Matter, cries <HI>Ned.</HI> When I look at the Gentlewoman's Face, I could &s;wear, twen|ty times over, to every Feature, but, when I look at her Dre&s;s and Manners, I could again almo&s;t &s;wear again&s;t her Face.</P>
<P><HI>Ned</HI>'s Perplexity added greatly to Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Curio&s;ity. He got up in ha&s;te and went in Per&s;on to in&s;pect the Party. When he enter'd, he &s;aw a young Woman who looked very pale and &s;ickly, but of a gen|teel Appearance, and neatly though plainly dre&s;&s;ed. She ca&s;t upon him a &s;en&s;ible and penetrating Look, and courte&s;ying to him, with downca&s;t Eyes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, your Pre&s;ence tells me that you are Ma&s;ter here. I know not for what Offence your People have confined me, but if it is on any Su&s;|picion of Mi&s;behaviour, I have here the Certificate of a worthy Man and a great Saint, who vouches at lea&s;t for the Inno|cence of my Conduct.&mdash;Here &s;he pre|&s;ented him with a Paper that contained the following Words:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="certificate">
<P>I certify that the Bearer hath &s;erved me upward of five Years in quality of
<PB N="7" REF="6">Hou&s;ekeeper and Intendant of my Fa|mily. That &s;he is a young Woman of di&s;tingui&s;hed Piety and Merit, and de|parts, at her own De&s;ire, on &s;ome Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>On reading this, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> bowed and made a Motion with his Hand for her to &s;it down. He then took a Pen and Paper that lay be&s;ide him, and wrote to the Pur|po&s;e, that he reque&s;ted her to allow him to detain her Certificate for about an Hour, after which he would return it, and endea|vour to make her amends for the unbe|coming Treatment which his People had given her.</P>
<P>On ca&s;ting her Eye over the Paper, &s;he made a low Courte&s;y, and &s;aid, I &s;hall wil|lingly attend, Sir, during your Plea&s;ure; but hope, in the mean time, that your Charity will afford me a Mor&s;el or two of the Fragments of your la&s;t Meal.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> then pulled a Bell, and hav|ing ordered &s;ome cold Meats and White|wine to be &s;erved, he bowed, and with|drew to his Company.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Ned,</HI> &s;aid he as he enter'd, this Woman is ju&s;t as much the Empre&s;s of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> as &s;he is your <HI>Mammy.</HI> Here, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> look at this Certificate; I have no Rea&s;on to doubt the Truth of the Character given in it, for her Per&s;on and Manners are every way conformable. I am &s;orry, at Heart, that I &s;ent in &s;uch a Hurry for Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding;</HI> I have thereby rai&s;ed a Sort of Expectation in them, and it may be ve|ry mortifying to have that Expectation &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;o wholly defeated.</P>
<P>Some time after, a Coach and &s;ix fro|thing Hor&s;es drove up to the Door, and Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> alighted, with a Kind of Impatience and Trepidation appa|rent in their Countenance. As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had duly received and &s;eated them; my dear Madam, &s;ays he to Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> I think my&s;elf very unhappy in having gi|ven you a deal of unnece&s;&s;ary Trouble. My poor <HI>Ned,</HI> here, has been utterly mi&s;|taken in the Per&s;on of the Woman whom he took to be his Mammy. The Certifi|cate of her certain Re&s;idence bears a Date even previous to that in which we found him; and her Deportment is more than a thou&s;and Te&s;timonies again&s;t her being of the wandering or di&s;&s;olute Cla&s;s of People. Be plea&s;ed, Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> to look over this
<PB N="9" REF="8">Certificate; I think it has all the Marks of its being genuine.</P>
<P>The Moment that Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> ca&s;t his Eye on the Paper, a well known Character, a well known Character indeed, he ex|claimed. It is the Hand of Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> my Tutor, my Friend; the Man of the World, excepting your&s;elf Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> for whom I have the deare&s;t Re&s;pect and Af|fection. No Que&s;tion can be made of any thing to which he &s;ets his Affirmative.</P>
<P>Alas, cried Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> then all the Hopes we had conceived mu&s;t again be ca&s;t a&s;ide. Here comes our Nur&s;e too, poor Woman, in great Ha&s;te; I &s;ent her Word that we had found the Per&s;on whom we &s;u&s;pected to have &s;tolen our Child, and de&s;ired that &s;he would meet me here di|rectly.</P>
<P>While Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> &s;poke, Nur&s;e en|ter'd panting and almo&s;t breathle&s;s, and, without &s;aluting or taking any Note of the Company, Where, &s;he ha&s;tily cried, where is the Boy, Madam, whom you &s;uppo&s;e to be your Child?</P>
<P>Ah! Nur&s;e, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> we were quite mi&s;taken in the Woman whom we &s;u&s;pected to be the Kidnapper, and &s;o that Affair is all over again.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
I have nothing to &s;ay, cried Nur&s;e, to this Woman or t'other Woman; but you mu&s;t not have another Body's Child put upon you; if he is indeed your Son, I &s;hall know him in an In&s;tant; I &s;hould know him from all the Children that ever were born. Why, Nur&s;e, cried Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> eagerly, do you know of any natural Mark, or Mole, or Spot, by which you could gue&s;s at him. He had no &s;uch Spot upon him, Madam, but, if he be a living Boy, he has a Mark of my own making that never will out, and that's the Rea&s;on that I never dared to tell you of it. What Mark, Nur&s;e, what Mark? tell me in&s;tantly, I beg you.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, you mu&s;t know as how the Weather was very cold, it being twelfth Day in <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Holidays. So you and my Ma&s;ter were from Home on vi&s;iting, and I had a rouzing Fire down, and my Child &s;tood by my Knee, being ju&s;t then twelve Months nineteen Days old, and as &s;turdy a Fellow, of his Age and Inches, as any could de&s;ire to &s;ee. So the Cat, all at once, threw down &s;ome crockery Ware behind me. Up I &s;tarted, to be &s;ure, and run to &s;ave the Ve&s;&s;els; but, hearing my Child &s;cream, I turned much nimbler back again, and found him fallen, with his little Neck again&s;t the upper Bar of the Grate. It was well that I didn't die on the Spot, for then
<PB N="11" REF="10">he mu&s;t have died too. So I whipt him up in my Arms, but he &s;hriek'd and roar|ed terribly. So I got &s;ome &s;oftening Cream and &s;pread it over the Burn, and I put a Pla&s;ter upon that again; and I cover'd the Place, from Day to Day, &s;o well with his Cap, that neither you nor my Ma&s;ter knew any thing of the Matter. But the Shape of his Hurt went &s;o deep into my Heart and into my Memory, that, as I was &s;aying and &s;till &s;ay, I &s;hould know him by it again among all the Children in all the World.</P>
<P>Go then, my dear Nur&s;e, cried Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> go immediately and examine if this Boy has your Mark upon him. Is this the Ma&s;ter, Madam, whom you &s;u&s;pect to be your Son? It is, Nur&s;e, it is; my Heart took a liking to him the fir&s;t Moment I &s;aw him; he too was &s;tolen from his Parents, and may as well be my Son as the Son of another.</P>
<P>Here Nur&s;e made a ha&s;ty Step or two toward <HI>Ned,</HI> but, &s;uddenly &s;topping and turning pale, ah! Madam, &s;he cried, I wi&s;h you would go and try your&s;elf; the Wound, if he has it, is ju&s;t under his right Ear; for if I &s;hould find, indeed, that he is my very Child, I &s;hall certainly run mad on the very Spot for Joy. I dare not try, Nur&s;e, I dare not try for the World, &s;aid Mrs.
<PB N="12" REF="11"><HI>Fielding,</HI> I am already all of a Tremble, I know not how.</P>
<P>Nur&s;e, then, plucking up a little Re&s;o|lution, &s;tepped &s;uddenly to <HI>Ned,</HI> and turned up his Hair; when, giving a loud Scream, &s;he had ju&s;t the Power to cry out, my Child, my Child, my Child, my Child! and dropped down in an angui&s;hing Fit of Hy&s;terics.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> on hearing her Nur&s;e cry out, ro&s;e ha&s;tily from her Chair, and would have gone to embrace her Son, but, fall|ing in&s;tantly back, &s;he fainted away. The poor Nur&s;e, however, was not &s;o happy. She broke forth, at Times, into convul&s;ive Peals of Laughter that made the Hou&s;e ring; and again &s;he fell into Fits of Weep|ing, &s;o outrageous and bitterly de&s;olate, as no Heart, under the Temper of Adamant, could &s;upport.</P>
<P>While the Family were all in Bu&s;tle, ap|plying Remedies to their Patients, Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> recovered, and, hearing the Cries of her Nur&s;e, &s;he went and kneeled down by her, and wept with her and over her while her Tears proved a &s;ea&s;onable Re&s;to|rative to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> found that his Lady was well recovered, he turned to <HI>Ned,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12">and, lifting his Hair, ob&s;erved the remark|able Seam that the Burn had made. It is, it is my Child! he tenderly cried. O my God, how is this? wherein have I de&s;erved thy &s;malle&s;t Notice or Regard, that thou &s;houlde&s;t thus vi&s;it me with thy Wonders, and by thy Mercies put me to Confu&s;ion of Face?</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ned</HI> kneeled re&s;pectfully down for a Ble&s;&s;ing, which his Father &s;ilently called upon him with lifted Hands and Eyes. He then rai&s;ed him, and &s;itting down, took him fondly to his Bo&s;om; thou art, thou art my Son, my beloved Son, he cried; my fir&s;t and my la&s;t, the only Offspring of my Bowels. Thou &s;halt no more be a Wan|derer, no more be a Beggar, my Babe. Thrice ble&s;&s;ed be our Meeting, and tenfold ble&s;&s;ed thy future Fortunes! O that our Lives, my Child, might be made one whole Oblation to him from whom this amazing Salvation hath come!</P>
<P>By this Time, the Nur&s;e's Di&s;temper was greatly abated, though &s;he &s;till continued extremely low and feeble, and did not &s;eem to recollect, except by faint Glimmerings, any Matter that had pa&s;&s;ed. Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> then propo&s;ed to take her to Town, to the Phy&s;icians; ob&s;erving that there was Room enough for her and <HI>Ned</HI> in their Carriage, and, as Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> made no Exception,
<PB N="14" REF="13">the Coach was ordered to turn directly to the Door.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Ned,</HI> during this Time, was as a Per&s;on who fluctuated between the dread of leaving known and certain Enjoyments, and the Hopes of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;omewhat that he had not yet ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> then &s;tepped up, in a Kind of quick Rapture, to Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI> He caught him in his Arms; my deare&s;t Sir, he cried, I love, I re&s;pect, I revere you, even next to my God! What can I return you? what &s;hall I &s;ay to you? All that I am or have &s;inks out of &s;ight from your Benefits.&mdash;I am ble&s;&s;ed, my dear Sir, I am ble&s;&s;ed be|yond Expre&s;&s;ion, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> in being made an humble In&s;trument of Hap|pine&s;s to a worthy Man. &mdash; O Sir, cried Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> what Events next to miraculous! we came to your Door, but we were not permitted to pa&s;s; our Carriage broke for the Purpo&s;e; you then told us of this Found|ling, but what Likelihood that among Mil|lions he &s;hould happen to be ours? You then propo&s;ed an Expedient for a&s;certain|ing the Per&s;ons from whom he was kidnap|ped. This Expedient failed. God, how|ever, would di&s;cover him, and had fore|ordained the Means. He &s;et upon him an indubitable Mark for the Purpo&s;e; none
<PB N="15" REF="14">knew of this but his Nur&s;e, and &s;he has re|vealed it. Had any one of the&s;e many Circum&s;tances been wanting, our Child mu&s;t have continued a Stranger to us for ever. Indeed, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> they are all concurring Proofs that you are un|der the e&s;pecial Eye of Providence. But, Sir, I fear we &s;hall have a heavy Lo&s;s of our Friend <HI>Ned;</HI> for, though he does not want his &s;mall Faults, he is a worthy hearted Child, and a very plea&s;ant Compa|nion. O Sir, cried Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> you and Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton</HI> have a Right to command both him and us at all Times. But come, <HI>Ned,</HI> take Leave, for the pre&s;ent, of your be&s;t Friends.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ned,</HI> with filling Eyes, &s;tepped re|&s;pectfully to Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> and, kneeling be|fore him, took each of his Hands and ki&s;&s;ed them, crying, my Father! my Father! whereupon Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> tenderly rai&s;ed him, and, pre&s;&s;ing him affectionately to his Bo|&s;om, cried, God be good to you, my Son, and make you a Ble&s;&s;ing to your true Pa|rents and to all your Kin!</P>
<P><HI>Ned</HI> then turned to <HI>Harry,</HI> and taking him by both Hands, and looking him fond|ly in the Face, O Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> he cried, I never &s;hall be able to &s;ay the Word Farewell to you, my Ma&s;|ter <HI>Harry!</HI> I was hungry and you fed me,
<PB N="16" REF="15">I was naked and you cloathed me, I was a Stranger and you took me in; the whole World to me was fatherle&s;s and friendle&s;s, when you were Father and Mother, and a whole World of Friends to me, my true Lord and Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry.</HI> Are you not my Owner, am I not your Property, your own hard bought Bargain? Did you not pur|cha&s;e me with your Stripes, and with your precious Blood, and will you &s;uffer me to be taken away from you, my Heart's Ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>Here <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;wallowing his Pa&s;&s;ion as well as he was able, cla&s;ped <HI>Ned</HI> in his Arms and cried, my Brother, my Brother, my Friend and Brother for ever! then turn|ing to Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> and wiping his Eyes, I hope, Madam, I hope, Sir, &s;ays he, that you will excu&s;e my young Friend, here, for his Partiality to a Family who have loved him long and very dearly; in a little time, to be &s;ure, he will love and re|&s;pect you both, above all the World, though put all together. Though I grieve to part with him, I heartily rejoice at his being found, and acknowledged to be the Child of &s;uch worthy Parents, and I hope, I &s;ay, that you will not be offended at his Concern for parting with his old Friends.</P>
<P>No, my noble Creature, cried Mr. <HI>Field|ing,</HI> we are delighted at the Proof that he
<PB N="17" REF="16">gives of his Gratitude, and at the Strength of his Attachment where he has been &s;o highly obliged.</P>
<P>O Sir, O Madam, &s;ays <HI>Ned,</HI> (ki&s;&s;ing the Hands of his Parents) did you but know the Value of what I lo&s;e, when I leave, when I leave &mdash; and here he bur&s;t afre&s;h into Tears.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> then took <HI>Ned</HI> in her Arms, and tenderly embracing him, cried, we do, my Love, we do know the Value of the Family that you leave, and it is the fir&s;t and the deare&s;t Wi&s;h of my Heart that we &s;hould all become as one Family and as one Hou&s;ehold. This Angel here, as you &s;ay, is your rightful Owner, and we owe him more, on that Account, than our whole Fortune can pay, and he &s;hall have you as long and as often as ever he plea&s;es; but, for this Night, my Darling, it would be very unkind not to go with your good Nur&s;e, your true and loving Mammy, who has &s;uffer'd &s;o much for your &s;ake, and her Ca&s;e requires that we &s;hould take her im|mediately to the Doctors.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ned</HI> acquie&s;ced, and, having ta|ken a weeping Leave of all the Family, not forgetting the meane&s;t Servant in the Hou&s;e, he &s;tepped &s;lowly into the Coach,
<PB N="18" REF="17">&s;at down by his Nur&s;e, and away they drove.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Family of the <HI>Fieldings</HI> were gone, <HI>Harry</HI> withdrew to his Cham|ber and locked him&s;elf in, while Mr. <HI>Fen|ton</HI> went to enfranchi&s;e his late Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t returned her Certificate to her, and then pre&s;enting her with twenty Gui|neas, he bowed and made a Motion with his Hand to the Door, intimating that &s;he was at liberty to depart when &s;he thought proper.</P>
<P>Having looked &s;everal Times, with Si|lence and Surprize, now at Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and again at the Money, I &s;hould be very ill de&s;erving of your Bounty, Sir, &s;he &s;aid, &s;hould I attempt any longer to impo&s;e up|on you. I am not deaf as you &s;uppo&s;ed, it was only an Artifice which I made u&s;e of, when taken into Cu&s;tody, to avoid an&s;wer|ing Que&s;tions that might have brought a worthy Family into Di&s;grace. But you look &s;o altogether the Gentleman and the kind hearted Chri&s;tian, that I think I ought to have no Re&s;erve of any Kind toward you.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed then, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> as far as Prudence will allow, to let me know who and what you are.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
I hope, Sir, &s;he replied, that I am very far from being what I was, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould be the very vile&s;t of the Vile. Wherefore, if you will allow a weakly Woman to &s;it, I will tell you the whole of my &s;hort Story, with the &s;ame Openne&s;s that I make Confe&s;&s;ion of my Sins to Him from whom, alone, I can look for Re|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My maiden Name was <HI>Fielding,</HI> my Fa|ther was a Gentleman of large Fortune and good Repute; he had by my Mother a very worthy Son who inherits his E&s;tate, and a very unworthy Daughter who now takes the Shame of confe&s;&s;ing her Faults before you.</P>
<P>My Mother was one of the holie&s;t of Women, and brought me up, to the be&s;t of her Power, in her own Principles and Practice; but &s;he died when I was in the thirteenth Year, an Age when the Blood is in the Tide of flow, before I had acquired a due Reli&s;h for my Duty, before the Yoke of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> became ea&s;y or his Burden delight&s;ome.</P>
<P>My Father then provided me a Gover|ne&s;s, a Woman well &s;killed in <HI>French</HI> and Needlework, and other &s;uch &s;hewy Mat|ters of Accompli&s;hment; a Woman al&s;o
<PB N="20" REF="19">of much apparent Mode&s;ty and Decorum, though inwardly of a debauched and la&s;ci|vious Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o pernicious to the Breeding and Morals of Children as their being permitted to keep kitchen Company, where high fed Hu&s;&s;eys and pamper'd Fel|lows form a Hotbed of &s;teaming Sen&s;uality and Guilt.</P>
<P>My Governe&s;s, though &s;omething elder|ly, took a liking to my Father's Clerk, a mode&s;t young Man, whom, however, &s;he had the Art to &s;educe to her wanton Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In order to promote her Intrigue, in my Father's Ab&s;ence, at Evenings, &s;he u&s;ed to procure Collations, and after we had eat and drank, to propo&s;e Plays and other Matters of innocent Merriment, as &s;he called them.</P>
<P>The Chief of our Men Servants was one <HI>Guilliam Rampant,</HI> the Butler, a comely robu&s;t Fellow, and one in whom my Father had placed great Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>One Night, as we were playing at <HI>Hide and Seek,</HI> this Man watched the Place where I &s;ought to conceal my&s;elf, and coming &s;oftly and &s;uddenly to me, he caught me
<PB N="21" REF="20">up under one Arm, and running with me to a di&s;tant Apartment, he there ruined me.</P>
<P>A fal&s;e Shame did not permit me to &s;ay any thing of the Matter, and the Villain had, afterward, the In&s;olence to threaten me that, if I did not admit him to further Familiarities, he would tell what had pa&s;&s;|ed, and expo&s;e me to the Family.</P>
<P>At length, both the Governe&s;s and I proved with Child, of which the Hou&s;e|keeper, in private, informed my Father; whereupon my Governe&s;s was turned, with Infamy, out of Doors, and I was locked up and confined in a wa&s;te Room.</P>
<P>On the third Day of my Impri&s;onment my Father entered, and having examined me with a &s;tern though &s;edate Severity, on my Knees, and with a Flood of Tears, I confe&s;&s;ed the whole Affair.</P>
<P>The Butler was then &s;ent for. <HI>Guilliam,</HI> &s;aid my Father, if you do not directly mar|ry this Strumpet, I will hang you for a Rape, but, if you marry her, I will give you two hundred Pounds to &s;et you going in &s;ome poor Way, on Condition that I ne|ver &s;ee the Face of either of you any more.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
The la&s;t Terms were immediatly compli|ed with. A Licen&s;e was &s;ent for. We were married in my Father's Pre&s;ence. The Money was paid down, and we were directly turned into the Streets.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;mall Fund, and about a hun|dred and fifty Pounds more which my Hu&s;|band had &s;aved of his Vails and Wages, he &s;et up a gaming Tavern to which there was great Re&s;ort; and as he was a very bold, &s;en&s;ible, and enterprizing Man, he became extremely agreeable to Numbers of his Cu&s;tomers, among whom there were many Per&s;ons of Fortune and Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>At length the Time of my Labour ap|proached. I lay, for a Fortnight, in Ago|nies that admitted of little Intermi&s;&s;ion. My Child died within me, and was brought into the World Piecemeal.</P>
<P>I langui&s;hed, for three Months after my Delivery, without being able to quit my Bed; and the Remembrance of the Pangs and Mi&s;eries that I endured cau&s;ed me to vow, within my&s;elf, that I would never more have any Commerce with Man|kind.</P>
<P>On my Recovery, therefore, I daily re|jected the Care&s;&s;es of my Hu&s;band, and,
<PB N="23" REF="22">every Night, I bolted my&s;elf into my Chamber, whereupon he began to behave him&s;elf with great Coldne&s;s and Di&s;tance toward me, and to frequent the Company of common and lewd Women.</P>
<P>In about fourteen Months after my Mar|riage, my Hu&s;band had a Run of Dice again&s;t him, whereby he lo&s;t to the amount of fifteen hundred Pounds; and as he had not wherewithal to di&s;charge the full Sum, he determined, at all Events, to pay to the la&s;t Penny of his Debts of Honour, as he called them. Hereupon he began to rai&s;e Contributions on the Public, and, af|ter &s;everal very bold and &s;ucce&s;sful Exploits, his Per&s;on became notorious, and he was taken, from amid&s;t his right-honourable A&s;&s;ociates, at a Gaming-table in <HI>London,</HI> conveyed to Newgate, tried, convicted, and executed at <HI>Tyburn.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, all our Sub&s;tance was imme|diately &s;eized by Creditors, or by the Offi|cers of the Crown; and I was turned into an unknown World, without any Thing to &s;u&s;tain me, &s;ave a few Shillings in my Pocket, and the &s;ingle Suit of Clothes which I happened to have on my Back.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, my dear Sir, that my worthy but afflicted Father had died before this Period; and this ought to have
<PB N="24" REF="23">been the greate&s;t of Afflictions to my&s;elf; but the Sea&s;on of my Feelings was not yet come, and I barely dropt a &s;light Tear, without any Sen&s;e of Remor&s;e for having been, in all likelihood, his principal Exe|cutioner.</P>
<P>As my Brother was now the only Per|&s;on, upon Earth, to whom I had any Right to apply for Support; I accordingly went to his Hou&s;e with an anxious beating Heart, and &s;ent him in a written State of my very deplorable Ca&s;e. But his An&s;wer was, that, if ever I &s;hould again appear before his Doors, he would take me up, as a Va|gabond, and tran&s;port me to the Planta|tions.</P>
<P>Wholly de&s;perate, by this Di&s;appoint|ment, and &s;timulated almo&s;t to Frenzy, my Blood boiled in my Veins. The hor|rid Thoughts of Vengeance could alone a&s;&s;uage my raging Spirit; and I re&s;olved to compa&s;s my Ends by Poi&s;on, by Dag|ger, or any the &s;peedie&s;t Means. For I looked upon my Brother as a Robber who had de&s;poiled me of my Title to my Fa|ther's Affection and Inheritance.</P>
<P>For this accur&s;ed Purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to get near him. I &s;old my Clothes, and having di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf in the Dre&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="24">of a Charwoman, I engaged as a Servant in a Cellar over the Way.</P>
<P>From this Place I ob&s;erved an Infant of about two Years old, who, at times, was brought to the Door by the Hand of his Nur&s;e; and I learned that he was the only Child of my Brother, and that the Lives of his Parents were wrapt up in him.</P>
<P>Here I conceived I had found an Object on whom I might execute my Revenge, with better Safety to my own Per&s;on, and greater Torture to my Adver&s;ary, than by any other Method that Invention could &s;upply. I therefore couched on my Watch, like a Lione&s;s for her Prey, and &s;pying the Child alone, I &s;hot acro&s;s the Street, caught him up in my Arms, and away I flew.</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened with him as fa&s;t as I could till I reached the Fields. I then got under a Ditch, and &s;tripped him of his gay Ray|ment which I folded in a Handkerchief; and having cut in Pieces an old Petticoat, and tacked it about him, I made my way to a Cabbin where they &s;old &s;mall Ale and Spirits, and there took up my Lodging for the fir&s;t Night.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, I am the greate&s;t In&s;tance, that ever was, of the Length to which hu|man
<PB N="26" REF="25">Nature can go in Reprobacy, when abandoned of God, and unvi&s;ited by his gracious Motions in the Heart. The &s;trong Bent which my Mother had given me to Religion cau&s;ed me only to recoil with the greater Force; and, when my Father ca&s;t me off, I even reproached my God, and was at Enmity with him for having &s;uffer|ed me to fall into my fir&s;t Offence again&s;t Virtue.</P>
<P>I was yet urged and carried further down the Hill of Perdition, by the Example of the licentious Set of Profligates that daily and nightly frequented my Hu&s;band's Hou&s;e, in&s;omuch that, in time, I began to reli&s;h their Profanene&s;s, and my Tongue as well as Ear, at length, became accu&s;tomed to Oaths and Execrations; a Vice, of all others, the mo&s;t unnatural, mo&s;t &s;hock|ing, and abhorred in our Sex.</P>
<P>In fine, I became an Alien and even an Enemy to all Goodne&s;s; and I would will|ingly have been a Party in any Kind of Wickedne&s;s, &s;ave that of per&s;onal Pro&s;ti|tution, and this I avoided merely for fear of a &s;econd Child-birth, which I dreaded more than I dreaded the Torments of Hell.</P>
<P>How pitiable, then, mu&s;t have been the Ca&s;e of the unhappy Infant who had fallen into my cruel Gripe. I often &s;uffered him,
<PB N="27" REF="26">on purpo&s;e, to weep for Hunger, and then would la&s;h him for crying, that I might plea&s;e my&s;elf, as it were, with the Mi&s;e|ries of my Brother in the Per&s;on of his Child.</P>
<P>For four Years and nine Months I led a wandering and mendicant Life, in which Trade my little Nephew grew very &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful and u&s;eful to me, &s;o that I began to abate of my Severity toward him. Dete&s;t|ed by my Relations, and outca&s;t from the World, I cared for nothing but Self, and nightly indulged my Appetite with the be&s;t Victuals and Liquor that my Pocket could afford, from the I&s;&s;ues of my own Petitions and of tho&s;e of my fellow Traveller.</P>
<P>One Day, having pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Enfield,</HI> where I had rai&s;ed &s;ome petty Contributions, I &s;pyed an Infant on a Bank, at a Di&s;tance from any Hou&s;e, and in&s;tantly the Project occurred of exacting the larger Charities by his Means. I looked about, and think|ing that I was not ob&s;erved, I caught the Child up and ran off with all my Speed. But I had not gone far, when I heard a Man &s;houting after me, and perceived that I was pur&s;ued. Thereupon I ca&s;t down the Child, with my Pouch of Provi&s;ions, and leaving little <HI>Ned</HI> behind me al&s;o, I made the be&s;t of my Way thro' the oppo|&s;ite Thicket.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
As my Terrors continued, I continued to run, till I was all in a glow and faint with Fatigue, but &s;till keeping forward, though &s;lower and &s;lower, God conducted me within Sight of the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> which I reached with much Difficulty, and then &s;unk away on the Thre&s;hold.</P>
<P>I knew nothing further of what pa&s;&s;ed till I found my&s;elf in a warm though coar&s;e Bed, with one Woman holding a Bottle of Salts to my No&s;e, and another pre&s;enting me with a Cordial. I looked about and found my&s;elf &s;omething revived, but, on the Sight of &s;ome Meat which was brought to me, I again fainted.</P>
<P>Within &s;ome Hours after, I was &s;eized with Pains in all my Bones, and fell into a raging though intermitting Fever. Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> who was Phy&s;ician to the Bo|dies as well as Souls of all his Flock, vi&s;it|ed and pre&s;cribed for me, and had me at|tended with great Humanity.</P>
<P>On the third Night, I dreamed that an invi&s;ible Hand came and, &s;eizing me by a &s;ingle Hair of my Head, hurried me aloft, through the Regions of the Air, till it held me right over a fiery Gulf, in the Pinna|cles of who&s;e Flames a Variety of Daemons
<PB N="29" REF="28">appeared to hover, the Horridne&s;s of who&s;e Figures was inde&s;cribable to Ears of Fle&s;h and Blood. They all &s;eemed to &s;truggle toward me, and to &s;tretch forth their Fangs to receive me, while my Hu&s;band, <HI>Guil|liam Rampant,</HI> a&s;cended &s;wiftly in the Mid&s;t, and, ru&s;hing up with a Pair of Sheers, cut the Hair that withheld me in twain, &s;o, down I thought I fell, and, giving a great Shriek, I awakened to Dark|ne&s;s and inexpre&s;&s;ible Horrors.</P>
<P>Though no Light was in the Room, my con&s;cious Spirit &s;upplied the Office. All my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions aro&s;e minutely and di&s;|tinctly to Memory. They appeared &s;ub|&s;tantially, as &s;o many Fiends, within me and round about me; and I fell into an Agony that threw me into a Fit.</P>
<P>I awoke again before Morning, but without any Abatement of my Terrors or De&s;peration. The former Objects conti|nued to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before me, and, no longer able to &s;upport Exi&s;tence, I gro|ped about for a Knife, or other In&s;trument of &s;elf-De&s;truction, for I &s;aid, to my&s;elf, perhaps Death may bring Re&s;t to the Wea|ry and Overladen, or, at lea&s;t, afford &s;ome Re&s;pite before the fearful Judgment of final Condemnation. So, finding no other Means that &s;uited my de&s;perate Purpo&s;e, I gra&s;ped my Neck in my Hands, and exerted
<PB N="30" REF="29">my Force to &s;trangle my&s;elf; but Nature proved repugnant to the Completion of an Office again&s;t her&s;elf, and I &s;unk from my Agonies into a &s;econd Fit.</P>
<P>On the breaking of the Day Mr. <HI>Catha|rines</HI> entered, but, as the Room was dar|kened I did not know who he was. He approached my Bed, and taking hold of my Hand, he &s;ighed and &s;aid, you are very ill, poor Woman, exceeding ill, indeed; you have more Need of a Phy&s;ician for your Soul than your Body; if you plea&s;e then I will kneel down and pray with you and for you, that God may receive your de|parting Spirit.</P>
<P>O no, Sir, I cried, I cannot pray; even to hear a Prayer would be wor&s;e than Hell to me. I have no God, no Saviour, they have long &s;ince departed from me; I am a Sinner to whom Hope can never come; Omnipotence it&s;elf can do nothing for me; I feel that, if God would, he cannot &s;ave me, except he were to create me over again.</P>
<P>And he can create you over again, cried the good Mr. <HI>Catharines;</HI> even in this In&s;tant he can make you a new Nature and a new Creature; he can &s;ave you from all your Sins by an inward Salvation, by
<PB N="31" REF="30">pouring the Abundance of him&s;elf into your Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>O Sir, I exclaimed, you do not know how vile I am. Even now I am in Hell; the Fiends have the Property and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me. O, if any &s;ingle Soul were to &s;uffer, for everla&s;ting, what I &s;uffer'd la&s;t Night, better it were that Creation had never been.</P>
<P>Here I recounted to him my Dream, with the Agonies that I felt, and my At|tempt to de&s;troy my&s;elf; when the com|forting Saint cried out, good Hopes, good Hopes! very excellent Hopes, indeed. The&s;e are &s;trong and ble&s;&s;ed Compunctions. I &s;ee that the Saviour of Sinners is determin|ed not to lo&s;e you. Be of good Cheer! here, take this Julap to recruit your weari|ed Spirits, that you may be able to lay open the Woundings of your Soul to the mini&s;tring Phy&s;ician of your dear and loving Lord.</P>
<P>But, do you think, Sir, &s;aid I, that there is any Hope for me? Hope, cried he, there is A&s;&s;urance, more &s;table than the marble Foundations of the Earth. God is all Love, he is nothing but Love, he ne|ver rejected Any that once turned unto him. His Incarnation, his whole Ta&s;k and Bu&s;ine&s;s upon Earth, his Sufferings and Crucifixion, his Agonies and Death were
<PB N="32" REF="31">cho&s;en, and embraced by him for the love and &s;ake of Sinners. It is in the Regions of &s;inning Nepthali, in the Darkne&s;s and Shadow of Death, that the Light of the loving <HI>Je&s;us</HI> delights to &s;pring up. But, come, my dear Si&s;ter, tell me who and what you are. Lay open, with Truth and Hone&s;ty, the manifold Di&s;tempers of your Sin-&s;ick Soul; your Weakne&s;s, your Po|verty, your Nakedne&s;s, your Pollutions, your Errors, and your Emptine&s;s; and He, who &s;hineth in Darkne&s;s, will de&s;cend into you, my Si&s;ter, and will be your Strength, and the Riches of pardoning Mercy to you; and will cover your Naked|ne&s;s, and purify your Pollutions, and turn your Errors into Rectitude, and your Emptine&s;s into the Fullne&s;s of the Joy and Glory of your God!</P>
<P>Here I made him a full Recital of all the Pa&s;&s;ages of my Life, as openly but much more minutely than I have done to your Honour. Never was Man &s;o affected. He groaned, he &s;obbed aloud, he wet his Handkerchief with his Tears as tho' it had been drenched in the River.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had concluded, do you not know me then? he cried, (breaking afre&s;h into Tears) do you not know me, Mrs. <HI>Phaebe?</HI> know you not <HI>Marmaduke Catha|rines,</HI> your Brother's Tutor and your Tutor,
<PB N="33" REF="32">the Man from who&s;e Lips you u&s;ed to im|bibe In&s;truction with &s;o much Avidity? Ah, had I &s;tayed, nothing of this would have happen'd; but your Brother got me pre&s;ented to a rich Living here, and &s;o I left my Vineyard and the Fruits thereof un|guarded; Oh that accur&s;ed <HI>Rampant!</HI> I left my Lamb to the voracious and remor&s;e|le&s;s Wolf! &mdash; From your Infancy, Mrs. <HI>Phaebe,</HI> you were the Darling of my Affec|tions; the Day did not &s;eem to &s;hine in which I &s;aw you not. Your Smiles cheer'd my Spirit, and your unaffected Graces played round my Heart.</P>
<P>Your Brother, too, &s;aw and approved my Pa&s;&s;ion for You. What Happine&s;s did he not propo&s;e to him&s;elf in our Uni|on! We will be Brothers, he cried, my <HI>Catharines,</HI> folding me fa&s;t in his Arms, we will be Brothers in Reality as well as Inclination.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e bli&s;sful Pro&s;pects &s;oon vani&s;h|ed away. You were &s;educed, my Daugh|ter, you were &s;educed from your Duty, from your God and your Lover. Your Brother writ me an Account of your fatal Falling away; and I &s;pent my Nights in Tears, and my Days in Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Ah, how you are altered, even in Per&s;on and A&s;pect, I could not have known you
<PB N="34" REF="33">again. Sin hath taken away the Innocence and Sweetne&s;s of your Countenance, and &s;pread a Cloudine&s;s and Stain in the Place thereof. But, you are returned, my Child, you are returned to Virtue and Piety, to your&s;elf and to your God, and he will once more beautify you, and make you, as the King's Daughter, all glorious within, and deck you with living Saphirs, even the morning Stars of the Preparation of the Appearance of <HI>Je&s;us!</HI></P>
<P>While the holy Man &s;poke, the nether Mill&s;tone of my Heart began to di&s;&s;olve, my Agonies and Terrors departed from me; my Brea&s;t began to heave with a kindly though &s;ad Emotion, and a Tor|rent of Tears greatly ea&s;ed my Di&s;temper both of Body and Mind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> as I afterward learned, on hearing of my doleful Mi&s;carriage, had vowed to him&s;elf, in &s;ecret, never to have Commerce with Womankind.</P>
<P>A widowed Lady, however, of large Fortune and liberal Education, but much advanced in Years, happened to re&s;ide in the Neighbourhood. She was fir&s;t caught by the &s;imple though affecting Piety of his Di&s;cour&s;es from the Pulpit. She vi&s;it|ed and was vi&s;ited by him. She was then further charmed by the Lu&s;tre of his Senti|ments,
<PB N="35" REF="34">the Sanctitude of his Manners, and the Sweetne&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition. Sir, &s;aid &s;he to him one Day, I am, by Birth, a Foreigner, and neither have Children, nor any Relation of my Blood in this King|dom who, on my Decea&s;e, may put in for a Title to my Fortune. I blu&s;h not to tell you that, if I were young and beautiful, you are the Man of the World whom I would have cho&s;en for my Hu&s;band. But my Defects take nothing from your great Merits. You are as precious in my Eyes as if I were de&s;erving of you; and I am de&s;irous of making yo umy Own for Life, provided you &s;wear to me, before the nup|tial Knot is tied, that my Fortune, my Company, and my Obedience are all that ever you will require from me in Right of our Marriage. You &s;hall live, and &s;hall be as an only Son to me; and I will have for you, at once, all the Duty of a Wife and the Tenderne&s;s of a Mother.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible of what Gibers may &s;ay, re&s;pecting the Impropriety of certain Appetites at my Years; but I tru&s;t, by my Conduct, to di&s;abu&s;e their Opinion, and to cau&s;e all Occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling, in my Neighbour, to cea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, my two capital Pro&s;|pects will be compa&s;&s;ed by this Scheme, the One, of giving my&s;elf a legal Title to
<PB N="36" REF="35">your Company; the Other, of giving You a legal Title to my Fortune.</P>
<P>A Propo&s;al, for &s;uch a Species of Mar|riage; an&s;wered exactly to Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI>'s Vow of Celibacy. The Lady, though con&s;iderably upward of Sixty, &s;hone in all the Graces and Attractions of Youth, ex|cepting only tho&s;e per&s;onal Allurements to Concupi&s;cence, toward which Mr. <HI>Catha|rines</HI> had re&s;olved on an Aver&s;ion; He could therefore form no rational Objection to the Scheme; and, within a few Weeks, they were privately married.</P>
<P>While I wept, as I told you, Sir, under a kindly Remor&s;e for my manifold Offences, Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> kneeled down and poured forth his Prayers be&s;ide me, with an Elo|cution &s;o warm, and &s;o deeply affecting, as entered and &s;earched through my Heart and my Reins, and &s;eemed to tear out, by the Roots, all the Evil that was in me.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had ended, and that I had thanked him, with Words half &s;uf|focated, for the Graciou&s;ne&s;s of his Con|&s;olations, Mrs. <HI>Catharines</HI> came in. Would you then, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, would you mono|polize all the Charities? will you not &s;uf|fer a Si&s;ter near the Throne of Grace, who may a&s;&s;i&s;t in the under Services to the Ser|vants of our Ma&s;ter?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">
My Dear, &s;aid he tenderly, I was about to reque&s;t your Pre&s;ence. Here lies on the Bed of Sickne&s;s, and perhaps of Death, the Daughter of my Patron, the Si&s;ter of my Friend, and once the deare&s;t Object of my Affections and Pro&s;pects for Life. Pray order a Chamber for her more becom|ing her Station, and my Debts to her Fa|mily.</P>
<P>She, in&s;tantly, went out with Alacrity, and without Reply, and, within a few Mi|nutes, &s;everal female Servants entered who, gently wrapping me in the Clothes wherein I lay, conveyed me to a Bed ready &s;heeted and warmed, that &s;tood in a &s;mall but de|cent Apartment.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was placed, Mrs. <HI>Catha|rines</HI> came up, and &s;tooping, tenderly ki&s;&s;|ed me and &s;aid, God be very gracious un|to you, my Daughter!</P>
<P>Here I was treated with an Attention and Delicacy, that joined with my evil Deeds to put me to utter Shame. How|ever, I began to recover apace, and within a few Days was able to &s;it up.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh Night I had a very &s;in|gular Dream or Vi&s;ion which will never depart my Memory, and which, I tru&s;t,
<PB N="38" REF="37">through Life and Death, will pre&s;erve its happy and comforting Influence upon me.</P>
<P>Methought I walked, with va&s;t Crowds of fine and merry People, along a Road of a gentle and plea&s;ant De&s;cent, made ea&s;y to the Foot like the Mall in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>On a &s;udden, my Hu&s;band <HI>Guilliam Ram|pant</HI> &s;tood be&s;ide me. I &s;urveyed him with a Delight that I had never known be|fore. He &s;eemed to &s;urpa&s;s in Beauty all the Per&s;ons around us; his Garments were embelli&s;hed with Gold and Gems, and his Countenance &s;hone with a wonderful Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Come, Mi&s;s <HI>Phaebe,</HI> &s;aid he, gracefully taking me by the Hand, come with me to yonder Paradi&s;e, where I will weave a Garland for you of never fading Flowers, and treat you to Fruits of a heavenly Fla|vour. Immediatly, a va&s;t Garden opened its Blooms and incomparable Beauties to my quickened Imagination. The Odours thereof perfumed the Air far and wide, and the burdened Trees reached forth Fruits of irre&s;i&s;table Temptation.</P>
<P>My Hu&s;band then plucked, and gave me to eat of the Clu&s;ters of the Grape and Apples of the Pine, which I &s;eized and de|voured with an intemperate Reli&s;h; when,
<PB N="39" REF="38">happening to look down, I perceived that he had got the Legs and Hoofs of a Goat, and it in&s;tantly occurred that he could be no other than the Tempter of our fir&s;t Pa|rents. Terrified almo&s;t to Death, I did not dare to &s;peak out; but, lifting up my Heart in a &s;ecret Prayer, He and his Para|di&s;e immediately vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>At once I found my&s;elf in a va&s;t and dreary Wilderne&s;s, who&s;e Trees were bar|ren of Fruits and the Brambles of Berries; through which there was no Path, and from whence there was no Outlet. Go on what Side I would, I had &s;carce made my way through one Thicket when I was pre|&s;ented with another; till, being &s;pent with Fatigue, I de&s;paired of any Deliverance, and &s;at me down to die.</P>
<P>Soon after methought Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> approached, in mean and beggar'd Apparel, but with a maje&s;tic and &s;tern Countenance. Wretch! he cried, are you at length come to a Knowledge of the Evil of your Ways? are you now come to a Sen&s;e of your vile and forlorn E&s;tate? do you find at la&s;t that I, alone, can be your Stay and your Hel|per? So &s;aying, he &s;eized me by the Hand, and his Touch filled my Frame with Con|fidence and Delight. We ro&s;e into the Air, we moved together over a boundle&s;s Tract of De&s;art, from whence the Lions roared
<PB N="40" REF="39">and the Wolves bayed at us. At length we alighted at the Entrance of a narrow Path that led up the A&s;cent of a moun|tainous Country. The nearer Side was covered with Clouds, and bla&s;ted by Tem|pe&s;t, through which the farther Part &s;eemed to gleam with a faint Radiance that promi&s;ed the ri&s;ing Day.</P>
<P>Courage! &s;aid my Conductor, we mu&s;t a&s;cend this Mountain, in &s;pite of all Oppo|&s;ition; in &s;pite of the Toils, the Difficul|ties, and Dangers; the Pains, Calamities, Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and Di&s;couragements of the Way. No Ob&s;tacles, I cried, &s;hall appal or di&s;courage me, I will rejoice in Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Pains while I have You by my Side.</P>
<P>Hereupon I felt wonderful Strength and Alacrity, I ran up the A&s;cent with a will|ing and eager Pace, and propo&s;ed in a few Minutes to reach the Top. But, alas! I was widely out in my Account. The Way became &s;traiter, and &s;teeper, and rougher. I began to fail through fatigue, and the edged Flints tore my Feet and marked my Foot&s;teps with Blood. Ah! Sir, I cried, this is very grievous, indeed. Peace, &s;aid he, it is very &s;alutary; the&s;e Flints are your kinde&s;t Friends, your true&s;t Phy&s;icians; and the Wounds that they give your Body will be more than the Balm of <HI>Gilead</HI> to the
<PB N="41" REF="40">healing of your Soul. I then &s;ummoned all my Powers and proceeded, though with much Angui&s;h, which often compelled me to lean, with all my Weight, upon my Companion.</P>
<P>At length we came to a Pa&s;s that was thick &s;et and interwoven with Briars and Thorns, and, &s;eeing no way, I made a full Stop. Good cheer, cried my Guide, this mu&s;t al&s;o be traver&s;ed, there is no quailing now, you mu&s;t endure to the End, my Daughter. The Thorn was pronounc|ed a Cur&s;e to the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> and his Po&s;|terity, but your &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> has made it a Wreath of living Brightne&s;s; The&s;e, ac|cordingly, are appointed to twi&s;t the Gar|land of your Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and to make you a Partaker of their Crown of eternal Glory.</P>
<P>Revived by this Promi&s;e, I ru&s;hed into the Mid&s;t, and &s;truggled to get forward, though &s;creaming with Angui&s;h; but, when the Thorns rent my Skin, and en|tered into my Body and Soul, and lodged their Stings within me; I could endure no longer; but, ca&s;ting my&s;elf on my Con|ductor, O that Death, that Death, I cried, would put an End to my Sufferings! He then turned and &s;miled upon me, and, taking me under his Arm, bore me harm|le&s;s
<PB N="42" REF="41">through the Remainder; then, &s;eating me on a Bank, he placed him&s;elf be&s;ide me.</P>
<P>While I &s;at, &s;till panting with Pain and Fatigue, He bent forward, and pulled off his Sandals. I then &s;aw the large Wounds that the Spike had made. My Spirit in|&s;tantly told me that it was my Lord, him|&s;elf, under the Form of his Mini&s;ter. I threw my&s;elf pro&s;trate before him. My Bo&s;om opened wide; and taking hold of his Feet, covered with Du&s;t as they were, I pre&s;&s;ed them to my Heart and would have thru&s;t them into my Soul; when, on their Touch, I felt &s;uch an ec&s;tatic Tran&s;|port, that, if I had not awoke, my Body could no longer have retained my Spirit, it mu&s;t in&s;tantly have i&s;&s;ued to Him who breathed it.</P>
<P>The Con&s;olation of this Dream greatly &s;trengthen'd and re&s;tored me, and I ha&s;ten|ed to get up that I might delight my&s;elf with &s;erving the Servants of my Benefactors.</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>Catharines</HI> ro&s;e, &s;he found me bu&s;ied in the ba&s;e&s;t Employments of the Kitchen. She looked a&s;toni&s;hed. Why, my Dear, &s;he cried, would you de|mean your&s;elf in this Manner? O, Madam, I replied, I be&s;eech you to leave me to my own Con&s;cience, it tells me that even this Office is much too honourable for me.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">
When Breakfa&s;t was ready, Mr. <HI>Catha|rines</HI> came in from his Morning's Walk of Meditation. As he enter'd I ca&s;t my&s;elf before him and, cla&s;ping his Knees, cried, How ble&s;&s;ed are the Feet of him who bringeth good Tidings of Salvation to Sin|ners! but, above all, ble&s;&s;ed is he who beareth in his own Per&s;on the Image and Impre&s;&s;ion of the Prince of Peace! Being much &s;urprized and aba&s;hed at my Manner of Salutation, he demanded the Rea&s;on of it, and I told my Dream, whereupon they were &s;o affected, that they Both &s;hed Tears of tender Congratulation.</P>
<P>I have already told you, Sir, that Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> was Phy&s;ician to the Bodies as well as Souls of all his Pari&s;hioners; I might have added, to all the Country about him.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e, he provided a little kind of Apothecary's Shop where he kept all Manner of Drugs for the Sick, as well as Matters of Surgery for the Sore and the Wounded. On the&s;e Occa&s;ions I became his principal Deputy and A&s;&s;i&s;tant. I was, my&s;elf, often a&s;toni&s;hed at the Effects of my Application in this Way. I &s;carce re|member an In&s;tance wherein I failed of Succe&s;s. A Spirit of Healing &s;eemed to accompany my Walks. I have frequently
<PB N="44" REF="43">cured Tho&s;e who were given up as irre|coverable by the Doctors and Surgeons. And I never had &s;uch heart-felt Delight as when, on my Knees, I bathed the Feet of the Sick, or wa&s;hed the Ulcers of the Beggar; for in Them, methought, the great Phy&s;ician of Sin-&s;ick Souls lay be|fore me, who had healed my own Wound|ings, and done away my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told you, Sir, that when Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> heard that I had &s;tolen and dropped my little Nephew, the only Child of his be&s;t and mo&s;t beloved Friend, He, that very Day, di&s;patched a Number of Emi&s;&s;aries to <HI>Enfield,</HI> and throughout all the adjacent Country, with Orders to make the mo&s;t diligent Search and En|quiry after him; but, alas! all our Pains and Solicitudes, both then and afterward, proved fruitle&s;s; this co&s;t me, Day and Night, &s;ecret Deluges of Tears, and &s;erved to imbitter the happie&s;t Life that otherwi&s;e, perhaps, could be &s;pent upon Earth.</P>
<P>About three Months ago Mrs. <HI>Catharines</HI> began to decline, and peaceably dropped, like over-ripe Fruit, into the Lap of our|general Mother.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> had often de&s;ired my Per|mi&s;&s;ion to write to my Brother in my
<PB N="45" REF="44">Favour; but, con&s;cious of the Injury that I had done him in the Per&s;on of his Child, I had hitherto declined the Propo&s;al. At length, however, I determined to throw my&s;elf at his Feet, and confe&s;s my Guilt, though without any Pro&s;pect of obtaining his Pardon; perhaps, &s;aid I, he may think on &s;ome more &s;ucce&s;sful Means for the Di&s;covery of his Son, than we have yet hit upon. My Benefactor approved of my Re&s;olution; he wrote a Letter to my Brother by me; and within a few Days, I &s;et out in his Chai&s;e for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>On the Road, I took it into my Head once more to make Tryal of my Brother's Nature, and to pre&s;ent my&s;elf before him as an Object of his Charity. For this Pur|po&s;e I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Chai&s;e at <HI>St. Alban's.</HI> I al&s;o &s;ent back my little Baggage with an Account of my Project in a Note to Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> and retained nothing but this poor Garb that I have on.</P>
<P>On that Night I was taken &s;uddenly and extremely ill of a Cholic, and could keep nothing on my Stomach for the &s;ix follow|ing Days. I &s;ent to <HI>London</HI> for a Phy&s;ician, who attended and pre&s;cribed for me; and, by the time I was able to creep abroad, what with Fees to the Doctor, the Apothe|cary's Bill, and a &s;till more exorbitant Bill
<PB N="46" REF="45">from the Landlord, I had &s;carce three Sixpences left to bear my Charges to the City. With that Sum, however, I &s;et forward on Foot; but, finding my&s;elf &s;till very weak and &s;ickly, I was tempted to repine for not having brought more Money from Home, but, again, I remember'd that my Ma&s;ter had told me that Sufferings were the be&s;t Friends and Phy&s;icians to &s;uch a Sinner. I was, therefore, content and plea&s;ed to be once more reduced to the lowe&s;t State of Beggary, and, after three Days &s;ore Travel, God was plea&s;ed to conduct me to your charitable Door.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is the Letter which my Friend wrote in my Favour to my Brother. You &s;ee it is open, but, before you read it, I ought to account to you, for &s;ome Touches of uncommon Tenderne&s;s, which Mr. <HI>Ca|tharines</HI> has expre&s;&s;ed toward me.</P>
<P>Some Weeks after the Funeral of his Lady, He and I &s;tood chatting in the Front of the Hou&s;e. The Evening was exceeding plea&s;ant, and the Maids &s;at &s;inging and milking the Cows before us; when the great Bull, &s;uddenly tearing up the Ground with his Feet, ran furiou&s;ly at his Ma&s;ter. On &s;eeing him approach, I &s;hrieked and ru&s;hed into the Hou&s;e, but, ob&s;erving that Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> did not fol|low, I turned and ran as precipitately out
<PB N="47" REF="46">again. There I &s;aw that the terrible Crea|ture had pinned him up, between his Horns, again&s;t the Wall, at which he butted with all his Force.</P>
<P>Then, ca&s;ting Fear a&s;ide, I &s;prung up and, &s;eizing the Bull by one of his Horns, would have torn him away from my dear Protector. But, my Strength not availing, I caught his Ear in my Mouth, and bit it through and through, while I endeavour|ed to tear out his Eyes with my Nails. In the mean time, a little favourite Ma|&s;tiff, &s;carce bigger than two Fi&s;ts, came happily out, and leaping up caught the mon&s;trous Animal by the No&s;e, where|upon he gave a hideous Roar and, fling|ing away, ran kicking and leaping about the Yard.</P>
<P>I remembered nothing more till I a|woke from a Swoon, and perceived that Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> &s;at be&s;ide me. He held one of my Hands, which he had wa&s;hed with his Tears, and which, at Times, he pre&s;s'd to his Lips, and again to his Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>When he had prevailed upon me to &s;wallow a Spoonful of Cordial, O my <HI>Phaebe,</HI> my <HI>Phaebe,</HI> he cried, you have this Day offer'd up your precious Life, a Victim, for the Pre&s;ervation of Mine, and,
<PB N="48" REF="47">from this Day forward, my Life, and all that I am, is your Property for ever. But tell me, my <HI>Phaebe,</HI> whence could you get, in a Moment, &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing Intrepidity, how attain to the Power of acting again&s;t Nature, the con&s;titutional Terrors and Delicacies of your Sex? Ah, Sir, I replied, the Book of Life tells us, that <HI>perfect Love ca&s;teth Fear away.</HI></P>
<P>From that Time Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> earne&s;t|ly pre&s;&s;ed me to Marriage. My fir&s;t, and my la&s;t, and my only Love, he would &s;ay, you know that in Womankind I can love nothing but You. Your whole Image, your every Feature is impre&s;&s;ed upon my Soul; I am already wedded to them, they are in&s;eparable from my Being. Why then do you wi&s;h to have me ca&s;t forth from my Species, as a withered Branch, without any kind of Fruit, without One, the lea&s;t little One, to bind us up together, and car|ry us down to Po&s;terity? O, Sir, I would then &s;ay, let not our Nuptials be &s;ullied by any Gloom or Regret; let me fir&s;t be re|conciled, if po&s;&s;ible, to my Brother, and then di&s;po&s;e of me as you plea&s;e, it is your Right &s;o to do.</P>
<P>I THANK you, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I thank you for your very affecting and
<PB N="49" REF="48">&s;till more edifying Narrative; and I will endeavour to recompen&s;e you for the Trouble that I have given you by being the Bearer of very happy Tidings. Your little Nephew has lived with me almo&s;t ever &s;ince you lo&s;t him. He has received an Education becoming his Family, and was this Day di&s;covered and re&s;tored to his Pa|rents.</P>
<P>My God, my Chri&s;t, &s;he exclaimed, what a Wonder is here! how are blind and er|ring Mortals, wilfully blind and wilfully er|ring, de&s;erving of &s;uch a Clue as this to guide them? My Nephew alive and well, di&s;covered and re&s;tored this very Day to his true Parents!&mdash;I am confounded, I am cru&s;hed to the Centre beneath the Weight of thy Benefits, O, thou overflowing Foun|tain of Mercy and Grace!</P>
<P>Now, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> now it is at your Election to reveal or &s;uppre&s;s the Affair re&s;pecting your Nephew. I know, Sir, &s;he replied, you propo&s;ed this only to try me; I de&s;ire no Advantage from Fraud or Di&s;gui&s;e, and, could I be &s;o ba&s;e, this Letter, as you will find, would detect and betray me.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49">
Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> then unfolded the Letter, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>TO EDWARD FIELDING, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend and Brother of my Soul,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have often reproved and always dete&s;ted that cruel and impious Cu&s;tom of ca&s;ting off our Friends, or Kindred, on account of their Errors or Frailty, or even of their Fall from Honour. This Cu&s;tom is more e&s;pecially condemnable and pernicious, when it affects the more tender and more pitiable Sex; the Indi&s;cretion of their near|e&s;t Parents begins the Alarm; the World follows and encrea&s;es the Cry; the Wretches, like marked Deer, are driven forth to the Hounds, and mu&s;t &s;peedily be|come a Prey to Famine and Death, or for ever be precluded from any Return to Virtue.</P>
<P>Had You, my dear Brother, had you given that Charity to your only Si&s;ter which you &s;lightly throw to a common Beggar, you might have &s;aved her Soul alive, and have continued a happy Parent of a promi&s;|ing Son at this Day. She re&s;ented your Treatment, She rent your Child from you, you merited the Motive, but I am grieved at the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="50">
As God has been plea&s;ed wonderfully to re&s;tore your Si&s;ter to Virtue, &s;he would rejoice to re&s;tore your Son to you; but it is not in her Power, he &s;trayed from her within &s;ome Miles of this Place; we have u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Means to recover him, but in vain; and his Lo&s;s hath co&s;t her Seas of Tears, and Years of Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Receive her, then, as a precious Pearl from the Bottom of the Deep, as a Ca&s;ket of Gold and Jewels recovered from Ship|wreck; She was dead but is alive again, &s;he was lo&s;t but is found. Receive her then, I &s;ay, as an Angel of God &s;ent on Purpo&s;e to effect your own Salvation.</P>
<P>I know not how it comes to pa&s;s that great Sinners often become the greate&s;t of Saints, and, in a Year, a Month, a Day, exceed in Growth and Stature a long Life of lei&s;urely Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Their Bows, as it &s;hould &s;eem, being &s;trongly bent the adver&s;e Way, they dart forward with the greater Strength and Rapidity. It is even &s;o with our precious <HI>Phaebe.</HI> She is become a gentle Flame of the divine Loves and Charities. While &s;he &s;tands upon Earth and Bends, in her Lowline&s;s, beneath all Creatures, the Moon of changeable Things is put under her Feet. She treads, as it were, upon the Stars of the Galaxy; and
<PB N="52" REF="51">I behold, at a Di&s;tance, and revere the Glory of her Steps.</P>
<P>Receive her then, I &s;ay again, as the deare&s;t Boon and Ble&s;&s;ing that Heaven can be&s;tow. But, O, re&s;tore her to me; give her to me, according to Promi&s;e, that &s;he may a&s;&s;i&s;t to conduct me to that Kingdom of little Children whereof &s;he is a ble&s;&s;ed Inhabitant at this very Day.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c.
M. CATHARINES.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Phaebe</HI> &s;miling, you &s;ee that Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> mu&s;t be a Lover, by the Extravagance of his Prai&s;e. I &s;ee, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> that he de&s;ervedly loves; and greatly de&s;erves al&s;o to be beloved. But, Madam, if you will be ruled by my Advice, you will &s;tay here till your Brother &s;hall call upon me, which I expect he will do in a very little Time. Mean while I will introduce you to a Si&s;|ter-Saint, who has been long tried and re|fined in the hotte&s;t Furnace of Affliction.</P>
<P>The very next Morning Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> rode to the Door, attended only by a &s;ingle Servant. As &s;oon as he had &s;aluted Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> and &s;at down, he took out a Note for 2000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and pre&s;ented it to him. You
<PB N="53" REF="52">mu&s;t not refu&s;e, Sir, &s;aid he, to relieve my Di&s;tre&s;s, by accepting this in Part of what I owe You. I can &s;pare it, without the &s;malle&s;t Inconvenience. I have lately re|covered a Tract of Land that lies contigu|ous to Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> the worthy Man of whom you heard me &s;peak Ye&s;terday; &s;o that I &s;hall &s;oon have the Plea&s;ure of taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable Acce&s;&s;ion to my Fortune, and, at the &s;ame Time, the great|er Plea&s;ure of embracing &s;o very dear a Friend. This Sum, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> comes very &s;ea&s;onably to the Relief of a Per&s;on for whom I have conceived an ex|traordinary E&s;teem and Affection, a Per&s;on who is entitled to my be&s;t Service, and who may al&s;o be entitled to your further Munificence. So &s;aying, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> ro&s;e, went to the Door, took Mrs. <HI>Phaebe</HI> by the Hand, and leading her toward her Brother, this Sir, &s;aid he, is the Gentlewoman of whom I &s;poke, and whom I recommend to your tendere&s;t Regards.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> looked earne&s;tly and in|qui&s;itively at his Si&s;ter, changed Colour, and, for a while, &s;at mute with A&s;toni&s;h|ment; when, &s;uddenly ri&s;ing, and &s;tepping ha&s;tily to her, he cla&s;ped her in his Arms, and cried aloud, my <HI>Phaebe,</HI> my deare&s;t <HI>Phaebe,</HI> my long lo&s;t, long &s;ought, my long lamented Si&s;ter! have I found you at la&s;t, are my Prayers at length heared, and are
<PB N="54" REF="53">you once more re&s;tored to my Bo&s;om, my Si&s;ter! Ah, what mu&s;t have been your Sufferings, what have I not &s;uffered my&s;elf, from the &s;tinging Recollection of the Bar|barity of my Behaviour? But, at the Time that you applied to me, I was exa&s;perated again&s;t you, by being told you had turned out a common Pro&s;titute; and, from your Connection with that Reprobate to whom my Father had unhappily married You, I was ready to believe the wor&s;t that could be reported concerning You. Pardon me, however, my <HI>Phaebe,</HI> do but promi&s;e me your Pardon, and I will endeavour to com|pen&s;ate for my injurious Treatment of You.</P>
<P>Here, the Si&s;ter dropped on her Knees, and, breaking into Tears and Sobs, repli|ed, you want no Pardon, my Brother, you never wronged me. &mdash; I de&s;erved all Sorts of Evils; they were due to my Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions &mdash; but I have injured you, I fear pa&s;t Forgivene&s;s, my Brother. &mdash; It was I who &s;tole your little Darling, who robbed you of your only Child, and cau&s;ed you &s;o many Years of Sorrow and Bitterne&s;s. &mdash; I de&s;erved it, I de&s;erved it at your Hands, exclaimed Mr. <HI>Fielding;</HI> let us then exchange Forgivene&s;s, my <HI>Phaebe,</HI> for our Child is re&s;tored to us, and we remember our Sorrows no more. So &s;aying, his Eyes
<PB N="55" REF="54">filled, and, tenderly rai&s;ing his Si&s;ter, he took her again to his Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> wholly melted by this pa&s;|&s;ionate Scene, took them jointly in his Arms, and then &s;ilently &s;eated them oppo|&s;ite to Each other.</P>
<P>My Si&s;ter, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> you have promi&s;ed me your Pardon, before you were acquainted with the Extent of my Faults. Our dear Father, in his la&s;t Illne&s;s, made me &s;it by his Side; when, heaving a deep Sigh, he thus begun. I fear, I fear, my Son, that I have greatly wronged your Si&s;|ter. I grieve at Heart that I had her mar|ried to that Ruffian <HI>Rampant.</HI> With a little le&s;s of Severity and more of tender Admo|nition, &s;he might have ari&s;en from her Fall; &s;he might have returned to Virtue and Ho|nour; her Errors might have been for|gotten, perhaps re&s;tored to Rectitude; She might have been le&s;s wretched, and my Days might have been longer. She was young, &s;he was artle&s;s and obvious to Se|duction. I, my&s;elf, joined to betray her, by that &s;he Wolf whom I appointed the Guardian of my Lamb. Perhaps, as &s;he affirmed, her Inclination no way concurred with the Force that was offered her. We ought, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to have covered her Shame; Shame only &s;erves to bronze over a ba&s;hful Countenance, and make it al|together
<PB N="56" REF="55">Shamele&s;s. Alas, my Child, all Things appear quite different, at my Death, from what they did during my Life-time; and the Pride of Blood, and the Re&s;ent|ment for injured Gentility give Place to the Calls of Nature and the Feelings of Humanity.</P>
<P>I intended your Si&s;ter five thou&s;and Pounds, but by my Will I have cut her off with a Shilling, le&s;t the Villain, her Hu&s;|band, &s;hould come in for any Share of our Sub&s;tance. Wherefore I leave You, in my Place, at once the Father, the Brother, and the Guardian of my dear Child &mdash; and here his bur&s;ting Tears prevented another Word.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was more compo&s;ed he proceeded. I adjure you, my Son, in the Name of our common Father, in the Name of that God to whom I am going, I adjure you, I &s;ay, to keep a con&s;tant Watch over the Conduct of your &s;till precious Si&s;ter, my Son! and (if &s;uch a One may be found) to keep in Fee &s;ome di&s;creet and pious Matron, who may in&s;inuate into her Ac|quaintance, and gain her Confidence, and pre&s;erve her from a further Progre&s;s in the Paths of Vice; for O, the Soul of my wrecked Child, at this Hour, is infinitely precious in my Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="56">
I further enjoin you that, in ca&s;e the Reprobate, her Hu&s;band, &s;hould peri&s;h by Sword or Pi&s;tol, or by the Gallows, as is mo&s;t likely, you will pay your Si&s;ter the Sum of three thou&s;and Pounds, but gra|dually at fir&s;t, as her Nece&s;&s;ities may crave, and the Whole, on your A&s;&s;urance of her Return to Virtue.</P>
<P>While her Brother was &s;peaking, Mrs. <HI>Phaebe,</HI> had thrown her Apron over her Face, and by her Groans and pa&s;&s;ionate Sobs prevented his Proceeding. At length &s;he exclaimed, Wretch, Parricide that I am! I have cut &s;hort the &s;acred Life of him who brought me to the World. You then loved me, my Father, you &s;till continued to love me, though I knew it not; and I have murdered the kinde&s;t, the tendere&s;t of Parents, but I will die to make Atone|ment, I will not &s;urvive you, my Father!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> then aro&s;e, and &s;tepped affectionately to his Si&s;ter, and taking her in his Arms, and mixing his Tears with hers, endeavoured to con&s;ole her. You did not, my deare&s;t Si&s;ter, you did not mur|der him, he cried; you accu&s;e your&s;elf of Faults of which you are no way guilty. Our Father was aged, and laboured under a Complication of Di&s;orders that mu&s;t, &s;hortly, have put a Period to all that was

<P>When Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> had re&s;umed his Seat, and that the Violence of his Si&s;ter's Pa&s;&s;ion had &s;ub&s;ided, he looked earne&s;tly and tenderly at her. I will, &s;aid he, my <HI>Phaebe,</HI> at &s;ome other Time, account to you for the Motive of my Barbarity to|ward you, and how I was impo&s;ed upon by the very Per&s;on whom I kept in pay to give me Intelligence concerning you. But tell me how it comes to pa&s;s that, in my Life, I never &s;aw you look &s;o charmingly? even during your infant Years, you never had &s;uch a &s;weet Simplicity, &s;uch a hea|venly Childi&s;hne&s;s of Countenance as you now have. It is, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he is the King's Daughter, <HI>&s;he is all glorious within,</HI> and the Loveline&s;s of her Spirit in|forms and &s;hines through her A&s;pect. &mdash; But here is a known Character that will fully clear up the Matter. &mdash; And &s;o &s;aying, he pre&s;ented him with the Letter from Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> when, at the Sight of the Super&s;cription, Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> gave an Ex|clamation of Surpri&s;e. &mdash; Then, unfold|ing, he read it in deep Silence, but by Fits, and Interruption; frequently putting, and long holding his Handkerchief to his Eyes.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed &mdash; Yes, yes, my dear <HI>Catharines,</HI> my Brother, he cried,
<PB N="59" REF="58">the Wi&s;h of my Heart &s;hall be accompli&s;h|ed for us both. You &s;hall have your <HI>Phaebe</HI> re&s;tored to you, and &s;he &s;hall be re|&s;tored to you with <HI>Benjamin's</HI> Portion, even a double Portion! &mdash; But, O my God, how wonderful, how miraculous is all this! to have my only Child, and my only Si&s;ter, at once re&s;tored to me by one and the &s;ame Hand! Teach me, teach me, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> by &s;ome new Method of Gratitude, to ex|pre&s;s a Part of the Sen&s;e of what I owe you!</P>
<P>You have already, Sir, cried Mr. <HI>Fen|ton,</HI> done and &s;aid by much too much upon that Head, and have thereby given me great Pain in&s;tead of Gratification. The Payment that I get is a Trea&s;ure hidden from all Men, &s;ave him to whom it is gi|ven. I will not, however, do you the Offence to return you your Bill, but &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of it in a Manner that, I tru&s;t, will be nearly as equitable. Mean while, my dear Friend, I mo&s;t cordially congra|tulate you on the &s;ignal Evidences that have been given of the Favour of your God to you, and of his watchful and intending Providence over You and Yours. I &s;up|po&s;e you will &s;oon &s;et out, with your amiable Si&s;ter here, on your Vi&s;it to your Friend and Brother the worthy Mr. <HI>Catha|rines.</HI> I &s;hall heartily pray for a blisful I&s;&s;ue to the Union of the &s;ainted Pair, and
<PB N="60" REF="59">I reque&s;t you to favour me with a Call on your Way.</P>
<P>Within an Hour after, Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> &s;et off for <HI>London,</HI> on Hor&s;eback; and <HI>Harry</HI> accompanied his Si&s;ter, in Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Po&s;t-chai&s;e, upon a &s;hort Vi&s;it to his Friend <HI>Ned.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were departed, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> took Paper, and wrote the following Letter to Mr. <HI>Catharines.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALLOW a Stranger, but a very warm Lover of yours, to felicitate you with his whole Heart on the Succe&s;s of Affairs. Our precious <HI>Phoebe</HI> was received with Tran&s;port by her Brother, and you cannot be more impatient than he is for your Union. He generou&s;ly pre&s;ented me with the enclo&s;ed Bill for 2000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> merely be|cau&s;e God had appointed me an humble In&s;trument for doing him &s;ome little Mat|ter of Service. Though I determined not to accept of any Part thereof, yet I dread|ed to grieve him by an avowed Refu&s;al. I therefore re&s;tore it to you and your <HI>Phaebe,</HI> as a Matter of Equity next to that of re|turning it to him&s;elf. It is &s;urely full as proper that your Family &s;hould take charge of that wherewith Providence had been
<PB N="61" REF="60">plea&s;ed to entru&s;t them, as that I &s;hould be encumbered with the di&s;po&s;al thereof. And indeed, my dear Sir, I am already burdened with more Tru&s;ts of this Nature than, I fear, I &s;hall be able duely to ac|count for.</P>
<P>That your Heart may always continue where your true Trea&s;ure is already laid up, is the Wi&s;h of, dear Sir, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When he had folded and &s;ealed his Let|ter, he took Bills from his Pocket-book to the amount of 1300<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and, on Harry's Re|turn from <HI>London,</HI> pre&s;ented them to him. Here, my Dear, &s;aid he, here is what will enable you to be more than ju&s;t to your Engagements, it will enable you to be ge|nerous al&s;o. And I de&s;ire, my <HI>Harry,</HI> in Matters of Charity, that you may never &s;tint the &s;weet Emotions of your Heart; for we have enough, my Child, and we are but the Stewards of the Bounty of our God.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Harry</HI>'s Speech was &s;topped, but his Silence was more eloquent than a thou|&s;and Harangues. He &s;uddenly threw his Arms about his dear Dada, and, hiding his Face in his Bo&s;om, he there vented the Tears of that Plea&s;ure, Love, and Grati|tude, with which he found him&s;elf affected.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="61">
On the Afternoon of the following Day <HI>Harry</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> went to drink Tea with the Widow <HI>Neighbourly,</HI> who received them with a Countenance that &s;poke an uncommon Welcome. Some other Com|pany had arrived before them, and ro&s;e on their Entrance. When All were again &s;eated, Mrs. <HI>Neighbourly,</HI> very affectionately que&s;tioned <HI>Harry</HI> concerning his Dada.</P>
<P>On hearing the Name of Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> an elderly Gentlewoman &s;tarted. Pray, Madam, &s;aid &s;he eagerly, is this Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> the Son of that noble Gentleman who lives on the Hill? He is, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Neighbourly.</HI> My God! exclaim|ed the Stranger, can this Suckling be the Father of the Orphan and the Widow? Is this He who goes about turning Sorrow in|to Joy? Who wipes the Tears from the Afflicted, and heals the Broken of Heart? Permit me then, thou beloved Child of the Father which is in Heaven, permit me to approach and throw my&s;elf at the Feet of my Pre&s;erver!</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he ro&s;e with a rapturous Motion, and, dropping at <HI>Harry</HI>'s Knees, &s;he cla&s;ped his Legs and ki&s;&s;ed his Feet, before he could prevent her.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="62">
Poor <HI>Harry,</HI> much to be pitied, &s;at a|&s;toni&s;hed, aba&s;hed, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t Degree. At length, recollecting, and di&s;engaging him&s;elf with Difficulty, my dear Madam, he cried, you hurt me great|ly, what have I done that you &s;hould put me to &s;o much Pain?</P>
<P>Babe of my Heart, &s;he cried, I am the Wife of your <HI>Vindex,</HI> your own <HI>Vindex,</HI> whom you redeemed from Beggary and Slavery; whom you re&s;tored to his wretch|ed Partner, whom you re&s;tored to his infant Daughter; All pining and peri&s;hing apart from Each other, but now united by you, my Angel, in Joy and Thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>Here, her Words were &s;uffocated, and throwing her&s;elf back in her Chair, &s;he was not a&s;hamed to give Way to her Tears, and putting her Handkerchief to her Face, &s;he vented her Pa&s;&s;ion aloud.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then ri&s;ing, and going tenderly to her, put his Arms about her, and ki&s;&s;ed her Forehead, and then her Lips. You owe me nothing, my dear Mrs. <HI>Vindex,</HI> &s;aid he, I am &s;till greatly in your Debt: I was the very naughty Boy who brought your Misfortunes upon you. But I am willing to make you Amends, and that will
<PB N="64" REF="63">do me a great Plea&s;ure, in&s;tead of the Pu|ni&s;hment which I de&s;erve.</P>
<P>The Tea-table was now laid, and Mrs. <HI>Vindex</HI> grew more compo&s;ed; when her Hu&s;band entered, leading his Daughter by the Hand, a very pretty little Girl of about &s;ix Years old. <HI>Harry</HI> in&s;tantly &s;prung up, and running, and throwing him&s;elf with a great Leap upon him, he hung about his Neck, crying, how glad I am to &s;ee you, my dear Mr. <HI>Vindex!</HI> Boy of Boys, cried <HI>Vindex,</HI> am I &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to have you once more in my Arms!</P>
<P>The Company then ro&s;e and &s;aluted Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> and congratulated him on his Re|turn to his ancient Habitation. But <HI>Harry</HI> took him a&s;ide, and having cautioned him, in a Whi&s;per, not to take any Notice of what &s;hould pa&s;s, he &s;tole a Bill for 160<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> into his Hand, &s;aying &s;oftly, it is good fir&s;t to be hone&s;t, &s;o there is what I owe you. And here al&s;o is a &s;mall Matter for your Daughter; I did not know, till now, that we had &s;uch a &s;weet little Charge in our Family. So &s;aying, he &s;lipped to him ano|ther Bill of 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and then, turning from him, &s;tepped carele&s;sly to his Seat, as though nothing had happened.</P>
<P>Mean time the a&s;toni&s;hed <HI>Vindex</HI> was greatly oppre&s;s'd. He did not dare to
<PB N="65" REF="64">offend <HI>Harry</HI> by any open Intimation of his recent Bounty, and yet he could feel no Ea&s;e till the Secret &s;hould be di&s;clo&s;ed. He therefore &s;tole &s;oftly to the Back of our Hero's Chair, where, unperceived of <HI>Harry,</HI> he di&s;played the Bills to the Company, beckoning, at the &s;ame time, in a way that forbad them to take any Notice; then, rai&s;ing his Hands over his Head, and lift|ing his Eyes toward Heaven, he ble&s;&s;ed his Benefactor, in a &s;ilently ardent Ejaculation, and, taking an empty Seat, joined in with the Company.</P>
<P>While they were in Chat, the little <HI>Su|&s;anna</HI> &s;lipped, unnoticed, from be&s;ide her Mamma, and veering over toward <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;he went on one Side, and then on the o|ther, and &s;urveyed him all about; then, coming clo&s;er, &s;he felt his Clothes, and next his Hands, in the Way, as it were, of claiming Acquaintance with him. At length, looking fondly up to his Face, &s;he li&s;ped and &s;aid, Me voud ki&s;s Oo, if oo voud a&s;k me. Indeed then, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> me vill ki&s;s oo, fedder oo vill or no. And &s;o, catching her up on his Knee, he pre&s;&s;ed her to his Bo&s;om, and ki&s;&s;ed her over and over again.</P>
<P>You All &s;ee, cried Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> it is not One of the Elders with whom our <HI>Su&s;anna</HI> has fallen in love. My &s;weet Babe, cried
<PB N="66" REF="65">Mrs. <HI>Vindex,</HI> her little Heart in&s;tinctively led her to her be&s;t Friend, to the One of All living who be&s;t de&s;erved her Love. Mi&s;s <HI>Su&s;anna,</HI> &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> put me in Mind of &s;ome very delicate Lines in <HI>Milton,</HI> re&s;pecting our Virgin Mother. For &s;he al&s;o refu&s;ed to ki&s;s the lovelie&s;t Man that ever was created, at lea&s;t till &s;he was a&s;ked.</P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash; "And though divinely brought,</L>
<L>"Yet Innocence and virgin Mode&s;ty,</L>
<L>"Her Virtue and the Con&s;cience of her Worth,</L>
<L>"That would be woo'd, and not un&s;ought be won,</L>
<L>"Not obvious, nor obtru&s;ive, but retir'd,</L>
<L>"The more de&s;irable."</L>
</LG>
<P>It is happy, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Neighbourly,</HI> for our weakly and over-affectionate Sex, that God has been plea&s;ed to fix a Monitor within us, who &s;truggles again&s;t our Incli|nations, who fights again&s;t our Affections, and is, with Difficulty, won over to ac|quie&s;ce in our De&s;ires. I know not el&s;e, what might become of the mo&s;t of Wo|mankind.</P>
<P>But then, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Vindex,</HI> are we not rather to be pitied, that, even when our Propen&s;ities are warrantable, we are prohi|bited, by Cu&s;tom, from giving any Intima|tion thereof to the Object. While the li|centious
<PB N="67" REF="66">Reprobate, Man, roves and riots at large and unreproved, beyond the Pale over which it is Trea&s;on for us to look.</P>
<P>I do not pity you, Ladies, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Vin|dex,</HI> I do not at all pity you on Account of any Re&s;traints, that Cu&s;tom has laid you under, re&s;pecting Cha&s;tity, or its Environs, called Decorum. The Cha&s;tity of Woman is the only Ba&s;is upon which the Order, Honour, and Peace of the World can be built. It twi&s;ts the &s;acred and endearing Chord of Society. Without it there could be no Amity, no Brotherhood upon Earth. But then, &s;urely, there is much Re&s;pect and Tenderne&s;s due to tho&s;e from whom &s;uch Advantages are derived. Whereas I have ob&s;erved, on the contrary, that the mo&s;t Amiable of your Sex are generally mated to Tyrants; to Men who, being born and appointed their Protectors, per|vert every End of Nature and Duty, and treat with Injury, Contempt, and In&s;ult, the gentle Saints whom they &s;hould have cheri&s;hed with their mo&s;t re&s;pectful Endear|ments.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion yet occurs, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> whether your Devils of Hu&s;bands find us Angels, or make us Such. Tyrants are like Files, they &s;erve to &s;mooth and poli&s;h what|ever they are applied to. I was once in Company with a Man who was called the
<PB N="68" REF="67">Saint-Maker, he had married five Shrews, in Succe&s;&s;ion, and made <HI>Grizels</HI> of every One of them before they died.</P>
<P>But pray, Ladies, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> are there no Tyrants among the Wives? I lately took a Walk to <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> and, growing hungry, I turned in to a little Shop of Gro|ceries. A &s;lender &s;kinny Woman, of about four Foot high, &s;tood behind the Counter, and taking out a Sixpence, I threw it on the Board, and de&s;ired her to give me the Value in Almonds and Rai&s;ins. She had &s;carce weighed my Merchandi&s;e, when a huge jolly looking Quaker came up to the Hatch Door, but &s;eemed fearful of open|ing it. The Moment the little Woman had ca&s;t her Eye toward him, &s;he exclaim|ed, in a &s;hrill and exa&s;perated Accent, Art thee there, thou Rogue, thou Hangdog, thou Gallows-faced Vagabond? when, ga|thering up the whole Dignity and Impor|tance of his Per&s;on, and clapping a Hand on each Side, he cried, with an undaunted Air,&mdash;<HI>I tell thee,</HI> Mary, <HI>I fear thee not!</HI>&mdash;Ah, thou Villain, &s;he vociferated, dares thee then appear in my Pre&s;ence? get thee back to thy Fellows and Hu&s;&s;eys on whom thee &s;pende&s;t my Sub&s;tance! &s;till, however, he kept his Ground, and courageou&s;ly repeated&mdash;<HI>I tell thee,</HI> Mary, <HI>I fear thee not!</HI>&mdash;Not fear me? Sirrah, Sirrah, not fear me, &s;ays &s;he, we &s;hall &s;ee that in a Twinkling. So
<PB N="69" REF="68">&s;aying, &s;he whipt up the mea&s;uring Yard, and &s;kudding round the Counter, &s;he flew to the Door. But he was already vani&s;h|ed as fa&s;t as his fat Sides would let him. And, to tell you the Truth, Ladies, there was &s;omething &s;o authoritative and tremen|dous in the little Body's Voice and Manner, that I was glad to get out and to &s;kamper after him.</P>
<P>The Company laughed heartily, and Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> added: I forget the Hero's Name, a great General he was, and I think a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> He won every Battle a|broad, but was &s;ure to be beaten in his Turn al&s;o, as often as he returned Home to his Wife.</P>
<P>Well &s;aid <HI>Hercules</HI> and the Di&s;taff, cries <HI>Harry;</HI> but to the Point, the brave&s;t Man I know is one <HI>Peter Patience,</HI> a Currier, who lives in the Suburbs. My Tutor and I were walking one Day through <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> when we perceived the Likelihood of a Scuffle at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>As we approached, we &s;aw one Man making up, with great Fury, to Another who would have avoided him, and who, retiring backward acro&s;s the Street, par|ried his Blows, and kept him off as well as he could. His enraged Adver&s;ary would
<PB N="70" REF="69">then have clo&s;ed in upon him, but, gra&s;p|ing his Shoulder with a long and very &s;trong Arm, he &s;till held his Enemy aloof, who nearly &s;pent all his Efforts and Blows in the Air.</P>
<P>Never did I &s;ee &s;o living a Repre&s;enta|tion of Heaven and of Hell as was vi&s;ible in the Faces of tho&s;e two Men. The Mu&s;|cles of the One were frightfully di&s;torted, his Eyes &s;hot fire, and his Mouth frothed with Madne&s;s: While the Countenance of the Other was as a Lake, in a Summer's Evening, that &s;hews Heaven in its Bo&s;om, and reflects all the Beauties of Nature a|round it.</P>
<P>Be quiet, <HI>Ben,</HI> he &s;aid, you know that I wou'dn't hurt you, you know that I love you. What a Fool the Man makes of him&s;elf, are you not &s;en&s;ible that I could demoli&s;h you with a &s;ingle Blow, but I cannot find in my Heart to do it. Be quiet, <HI>Ben,</HI> I &s;ay, I &s;ee you want to vex me, but I won't be vexed by you, my dear <HI>Ben.</HI></P>
<P>While the gentle <HI>Peter</HI> was thus expo&s;|tulating with his exa&s;perated Friend, Mrs. <HI>Patience,</HI> as it &s;hould &s;eem, had &s;een all that pa&s;&s;ed from an upper Ca&s;ement, and flying down Stairs, and ru&s;hing out at the Door, &s;he &s;eized her Hu&s;band, behind, by
<PB N="71" REF="70">the Hair of his Head, and tore and cuffed away at a terrible Rate.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Peter,</HI> finding him&s;elf thus between two Fires, gave a &s;light Trip to his male A&s;&s;ailant who, in&s;tantly, fell with his Shoulder again&s;t the Pavement, and, ri&s;ing with Difficulty, limped homeward, mut|tering Cur&s;es all the Way.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Peter,</HI> turning meekly to the Lady Mi&s;tre&s;s of his Hou&s;e, <HI>Gatty,</HI> my Love, &s;ays he, what have I done to provoke you?&mdash;O, &s;he cried, you mean &s;pirited, Hare-hearted, Milk-liver'd Poltroon; I'll teach you what it is to &s;uffer every Fellow to pommel you!&mdash;Sirrah, Sirrah (and &s;till &s;he cuffed) I'll have you tied down at the Foot of the Market Cro&s;s, with Notice on your Brea&s;t, for All who pa&s;s to p&mdash;s upon you.</P>
<P>Then, quite angry to &s;ee the Man &s;o abu&s;ed, to whom I had taken &s;uch a Fancy, I ru&s;hed in between Man and Wife, and &s;eized Mrs. <HI>Patience</HI> by both her Hands; but wrenching One of them from me, &s;he gave me a round Cuff on the Side of my Head. I was, however, too well u&s;ed to Cuffs to matter that much; and &s;o, catching one of her Hands in both of mine, I gave her a Pluck to me, and a
<PB N="72" REF="71">Foot at the &s;ame time, and laid her on the Broad of her Back in the Kennel.</P>
<P>My Friend <HI>Peter</HI> looked quite a&s;toni&s;h|ed at this, and fearing what might happen to me, on the ri&s;ing up of his Wife, he tucked me like a Gizzard under the Wing of a Turkey, and off he &s;coured with me down the Street, while Mr. <HI>Clements</HI> al&s;o made pretty nimbly after us, for Fear, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that Mrs. <HI>Patience,</HI> when on her Legs, might take him for One of our Company.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had turned a Corner, and were out of Harm's Way, hone&s;t <HI>Peter</HI> &s;et me down. My Friend, &s;ays I, if you would be advi&s;ed by me, you will not be in a mighty Hurry to get back to your Wife; I &s;ee a Hou&s;e of Entertainment yonder, and I wi&s;h to be further acquaint|ed with you. Adad, &s;aid he, you are the bolde&s;t little Body that ever I knew; you performed a Feat, to Day, that made me tremble for you. Had any other Man tho' u&s;ed my Wife &s;o&mdash;but I pa&s;s that Matter over; I &s;ee you're too great a Hero to be threaten'd by any One, and I &s;hould con&s;ider that you did what you did for my Sake.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, we all went into a Sort of a Tavern, and, being &s;hewn to a little
<PB N="73" REF="72">Parlour, I called for a Pint of White|wine.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were &s;eated, I took my new Acquaintance very lovingly by the Hand. My dear Friend, &s;aid I, I have conceived a great Re&s;pect and Fondne&s;s for you, and &s;hould be glad to know who and what you are. I am a Currier by Trade, Sir, and my Name is <HI>Peter Pa|tience.</HI> You are Patience it&s;elf, indeed, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> but your Wife, as I think, has taken the whole Trade of the Currier into her own Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> laughed and replied, She is a dear and a &s;weet Girl as ever lay by the Side of a Man, and &s;he loves me as &s;he loves her own Soul. Her Blows were &s;weet Blows to me, they were the Blows of her Affection. For, though I did not matter the Strokes of my Friend <HI>Benjamin</HI> a &s;ingle Philip, yet every one of them went to her Heart, and &s;he wanted to frighten me from ever taking the like again.</P>
<P>But pray, &s;ays I, how happened the Quarrel between you and your Friend <HI>Ben|jamin,</HI> as you call him? Why, there it is too, &s;aid <HI>Peter,</HI> he al&s;o beat me, out of his downright and true hearted Kindne&s;s to me.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="73">
As this is Holiday in the Afternoon, a|mong us Trade-folk, <HI>Ben Te&s;ty</HI> invited me to &s;hare of a Can of Flip, at the Cat and Bagpipes over the way. Ju&s;t as we &s;at down, <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;ays he, I am told that your <HI>Gatty</HI> is with Child; I believe it may be &s;o, &s;ays I. I am glad of it, <HI>Peter,</HI> with all my Heart; and &s;o now remember that I be&s;peak my&s;elf Go&s;&s;ip. Why that may happen, &s;ays I, ju&s;t as Matters &s;hall turn out. If the Child is a Boy, you &s;hall be one of the Godfathers and welcome; but if it is a Girl, this cannot be, for my Uncle <HI>Geoffry</HI> has already engaged him&s;elf, and I have &s;ome Expectations from him. And &s;o, &s;ays he, you refu&s;e to admit me for your Go&s;&s;ip. If it is a Girl, &s;ays I, you &s;ee that I cannot. O, he cried, I had forgot, I was a Ra&s;cal for propo&s;ing it, You're of high Blood, have high Relations, and &s;o &s;corn to have Connexions with a poor Trade&s;man like me. That is not the Ca&s;e indeed, my dear <HI>Ben,</HI> but&mdash;Damn your Dears, &s;ays he, I will have no more of them, you are a covetous Scoundrel and value Money more than Love. Well, &s;ays I, but will you be patient, will you hear Rea&s;on, my Friend? Friend, Friend, &s;ays he, my Cur&s;e upon all &s;uch Friend|&s;hips! I &s;ee into you now. You're an ungrateful, unloving, cold-hearted Vil|lain, and I would &s;ooner be Godfather
<PB N="75" REF="74">to the Child of the Turk. So &s;aying, he &s;truck at me, and repeated his Blows acro&s;s the Table. But, as I &s;aw that his Choler was enflaming more and more, I got up and retreated, merely intending to defend my&s;elf till his Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;pent upon me. But you &s;aw what happened, Gen|tlemen, which I am heartily &s;orry for, as I fear that my poor dear Fellow is much hurt.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my Tutor, I have heard many Definitions, and many Di&s;putes concerning the Word Courage, but I never &s;aw the Thing it&s;elf, till this Day. Pray Mr. <HI>Peter,</HI> were you never angry? Scarce ever, Sir, that I remember, at lea&s;t on my own Account, for I do not fear any Man that &s;teps upon Earth, and what is it then that &s;hould make me angry? A Man may be angry, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> from o|ther Motives &s;ure, be&s;ides that of Fear. God him&s;elf can be angry, and yet he can|not po&s;&s;ibly fear.</P>
<P>I am feelingly a&s;&s;ured, Sir, replied the valiant <HI>Peter,</HI> that God was never angry in his whole Life, and that is a long Time that has neither Beginning nor Ending. Don't you believe the Go&s;pel, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Cle|ment;</HI> the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us, in a hun|dred Places, of the Anger of God again&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="75">impenitent Sinners. I am the Son of a Clergyman, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Peter,</HI> and mayhap could quote Scripture as well as Another. The Scriptures were written for Man, but how &s;hould Man under&s;tand them, if they were not written according to his own Language and to his own Pa&s;&s;ions? I will a&s;k you a Que&s;tion, Sir, Can you be angry at a Mite or a Worm which you can cru&s;h into nothing at plea&s;ure? I think not, &s;aid my Tutor. No certainly, &s;aid <HI>Peter,</HI> be|cau&s;e you cannot fear a thing that has not Power to offend you. Now, all the World is but as a Worm or Mite to God, and neither Men nor Angels can di&s;turb or affect him with any thing, except Delight, on their Acceptance of that Happine&s;s which he de&s;ires to give to all his Creatures.</P>
<P>Ay but, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> you &s;ee that God's Anger and Indignation was &s;o great again&s;t Sin, that nothing could &s;atisfy for it &s;ave the Death of his beloved Son. Ay but, &s;ays <HI>Peter,</HI> the Scripture, which you quote, tells you that it was not his Anger but his Love that &s;ent him to us. <HI>For God &s;o loved the World</HI> (a very &s;inful World in|deed) <HI>that he gave his only begotten Son to take his Death upon the Cro&s;s.</HI> And I am as fully a&s;&s;ured, as I am of my own Being, that the &s;ame gracious God, who has al|ready redeemed poor Sinners, would will|ingly redeem the poor Devils al&s;o, if they
<PB N="77" REF="76">could but find in their Hearts to de&s;ire his Salvation.</P>
<P>Here, catching and cla&s;ping his Hand, my dear <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;ays I, I embrace and wi&s;h from my Heart that your Doctrine may be true. I have many Tutors, Mr. <HI>Peter,</HI> and my Dada pays them all with Plea&s;ure for the In&s;tructions that they give me. Tell me then, Mr. <HI>Peter,</HI> what mu&s;t he give you for the Le&s;&s;on which you have taught me? What Le&s;&s;on, my Hero? a very precious Le&s;&s;on, &s;ays I, a Le&s;&s;on that will always teach me <HI>to de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf for a Coward whenever I &s;hall be angry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> then &s;prung up, without &s;peaking a Word, and hugged, and cla&s;ped, and ki&s;&s;ed me with all his Affections. Then, plucking a Button from the upper Part of my Coat, I will accept of this Token, my Darling, &s;ays he, and will look at it, many a time in the Day, for your Sake.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;ays I, I think it would be my Advantage to keep up an Acquain|tance with you, and this cannot be &s;o well done, while your dear <HI>Gatty</HI> is angry with me. You mu&s;t therefore promi&s;e me to carry a Token to her al&s;o, as an Olive Branch of that Peace which I want to be made between us. I will, my Love, &s;ays he, I never refu&s;e to give or accept the Fa|vours
<PB N="78" REF="77">of a Friend. You mu&s;t be upon Honour then, not to reject what I offer You. I am upon Honour, he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I then &s;lipped Something into his Hand, at which he looked and looked again; and then cried out, from the overflowings of a good and grateful Heart, You are either of the Blood Royal, or ought to be &s;o. For the Man was very poor, though &s;o very &s;en&s;ible and well de&s;cended, and &s;o he look|ed upon a little as a great Matter.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Harry</HI> clo&s;ed his Narration, and all the Company gathered about him, and nearly &s;mothered him with their Care&s;&s;es, in which little <HI>Su&s;anna</HI> came in for her full Share.</P>
<P>On the following Day, <HI>Harry</HI> introduced his Friend <HI>Vindex</HI> and Family to his dear Dada, who received them with a Graciou&s;|ne&s;s that &s;oon di&s;pelled that aukward Diffi|dence and humbling Sen&s;e of Obligations, under which the late unhappy Preceptor apparently &s;unk.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was known abroad that Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> enjoyed the Patronage and good Countenance of Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and his Family, his former Friends re&s;orted to him, his Acquaintance was &s;ought by all the
<PB N="79" REF="78">Neighbourhood, his Credit was re&s;tored, his School daily encrea&s;ed, and, like <HI>Job,</HI> his latter End was far more ble&s;&s;ed than his Beginning.</P>
<P>Within a few Weeks, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> with their Si&s;ter <HI>Phoebe,</HI> our Friend <HI>Ned,</HI> and a &s;plendid Equipage, called and breakfa&s;ted at Mr. <HI>Fenton's;</HI> and, &s;oon af|ter, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and his <HI>Harry,</HI> with Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> attended their Vi&s;itants to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> where, All together, they &s;pent the happie&s;t Night: But that this Happine&s;s was blended, at times, with the affecting Con&s;ideration of parting in the Morning.</P>
<P>For two &s;ucceeding Years and upward, little intere&s;ting happened, &s;ave that our Hero encrea&s;ed in Stature and all per&s;onal Accompli&s;hments, and had happily got over the Mea&s;les and Small-Pox. He was now nearly Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Languages. He could outrun the Rain-Deer, and outbound the Antelope. He was held in Veneration by all Ma&s;ters of the noble Science of Defence. His Action was Vigour, his Countenance was Loveli|ne&s;s, and his Movement was Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> by this time, was al&s;o ver&s;ed in mo&s;t of the &s;elect and intere&s;ting Portions of Hi&s;tory. Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> had in&s;tructed
<PB N="80" REF="79">him in the u&s;e of the Globes and Maps, and, as he there led him from Clime to Clime and Country to Country, he brought him acquainted with the different Man|ners, Cu&s;toms, Laws, Polities, Govern|ments, Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, and Revolutions of the &s;everal Nations through which they pa&s;&s;ed. Finally, &s;aid <HI>Clement,</HI> you &s;ee, Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> that the mightie&s;t States, like Men, have the Principles of Growth, as likewi&s;e of Di&s;&s;olution within their own Frame. Like Men, they are born and die, have their Commencement and their Peri|od. They ari&s;e, like the Sun, from the Darkne&s;s of <HI>Poverty,</HI> to <HI>Temperance, Indu&s;|try, Liberty, Valour, Power, Conque&s;t, Glory,</HI> (OPULENCE) and there is their Zenith. From whence they decline, to <HI>Ea&s;e, Sen|&s;uality, Venality, Vice, Corruption, Cow|ardice, Imbecility, Infamy, Slavery.</HI> And &s;o good Night!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> now judged it full time to give our Hero an In&s;ight into the Nature of the Con&s;titution of his own Country; a Con&s;titution, of who&s;e Con&s;truction, Poi&s;e, Action, and Counteraction, the letter'd Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> had &s;carcely any Notion, and even the Learned in our Laws, and the Leaders in our Senate, but a very confu&s;ed Idea.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80">
For this e&s;pecial Purpo&s;e he called <HI>Harry</HI> to his Clo&s;et. You are already, my Love, &s;aid he, a Member of the <HI>Briti&s;h State,</HI> and, on that Account, have many Privi|leges to claim, and many Duties to perform toward your Country in particular, inde|pendent of your general Duties to Man|kind.</P>
<P>Should it plea&s;e God to ble&s;s your Friends with the Continuance of your Life for eight or ten Years longer, you will then be a Member of the Legi&s;lature of GREAT BRITAIN, one of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant Tru&s;ts that can be confided by Mankind.</P>
<P>Here, my <HI>Harry,</HI> I have penned or ra|ther pencilled, for your u&s;e, an Ab&s;tract in Miniature of this wonderful Con&s;titution. But, before I give it, for your Study and frequent Peru&s;al, I would give you &s;ome Knowledge of the Claims whereon it is founded, as al&s;o of the Nature of Man in his pre&s;ent depraved State, and of his &s;everal Relations as a Subject and as a Sovereign.</P>
<P>Man comes into this World, the weake&s;t of all Creatures, and, while he continues in it, is the mo&s;t dependent. Nature nei|ther cloathes him with the warm Fleece of
<PB N="82" REF="81">the Sheep, nor, the gay Plumage of the Bird; neither does he come forth in the Vigour of the Fole or the Fawn, who, on the Hour of their Birth, fri&s;k about and exult in the Ble&s;&s;ing of new Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Sacred Hi&s;tory, indeed, intimates that Man was originally created invulnerable and immortal, that the Fire could not burn him, Stones wound, Air bla&s;t, or Water drown him. That he was the an|gelic Lord and Controller of this Earth, and the&s;e Heavens that roll around us; with Powers to &s;ee, at once, into the E&s;&s;ences, Natures, Properties, and Di&s;|tinctions of Things; to unfold all their Virtues, to call forth all their Beauties, and to rule, &s;ubdue, and moderate the&s;e Ele|ments at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The&s;e, truly, were Godlike Gifts, illu&s;|trious Powers and Prerogatives, and well becoming an Offspring produced in the EXPRESS IMAGE of an all-potent, all-wi&s;e, and all-beneficent CREATOR.</P>
<P>True Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> but then we &s;ee nothing, now, of all this Greatne&s;s and Glory. Man, on the contrary, is him&s;elf &s;ubjected to all the Elements over which, you &s;ay, he was appointed the Ruler; he has every thing to fear from every thing about him, even the In&s;ects and little
<PB N="83" REF="82">Midges fearle&s;sly attack and &s;ting this boa&s;ted Lord of the Creation; and Hi&s;tory &s;hews, from the Beginning of the World, that the greate&s;t of all Enemies to Man, is Man.</P>
<P>This, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> is continually to remind him of the depraved and guilty State into which he is fallen. Man indeed is now no better than the Remains of Man; but then the&s;e Remains are &s;ufficient to prove the Lu&s;tre and Dignity of his ori|ginal State. When you behold the Ruins of &s;ome lofty and &s;pacious Palace, you im|mediately form an Idea of the original Beau|ty and Stateline&s;s of the Structure. Even &s;o, in our pre&s;ent feeble and fractured State, a di&s;cerning Eye may di&s;cover many Traces and Fragments of MAN'S MAGNI|FICENT RUIN, Thoughts that wing In|finity; Apprehen&s;ions that reach through Eternity; a Fancy that creates; an Imagi|nation that contains a Univer&s;e; Wi&s;hes that a World hath not wherewithal to gra|tify; and De&s;ires that know neither Ending nor Bound.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, are but the faint Glim|merings of his once glorious Illumination; All his primitive Faculties are now lap&s;ed and darkened; He is become en&s;laved to his natural Subjects; The World is wre&s;ted out of his Hands; he comes as an Alien
<PB N="84" REF="83">into it, and may literally be called <HI>a Stran|ger and Pilgrim upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P>All other Animals are gifted with a clear Knowledge and in&s;tant Di&s;cernment of whatever concerns them. Man's utmo&s;t Wi&s;dom, on the contrary, is the bare Re|&s;ult of <HI>comparing</HI> and <HI>inferring,</HI> a mere <HI>Enquirer</HI> called <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> a <HI>Sub&s;titute</HI> in the want of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> a <HI>Groper</HI> in the want of <HI>Light,</HI> he mu&s;t <HI>doubt</HI> before he <HI>rea&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>examine</HI> before he <HI>decides.</HI></P>
<P>Thus ignorant, feeble, deeply depraved, and the lea&s;t &s;ufficient, of all Creatures, in a &s;tate of Independence, Man is impelled to derive Succour, Strength, and even Wi&s;dom from Society. When he turns a pitying Ear and helping Hand to the Di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, he is entitled, in his Turn, to be heared and a&s;&s;i&s;ted. He is intere&s;ted in Others, Others are intere&s;ted in him. His Affections grow more diffu&s;ed, his Powers more complicated; and, in any Society or Sy&s;tem of &s;uch mutual Benevolence, Each would enjoy the Strength, Virtue, and Efficacy of the Whole.</P>
<P>You have Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> here drawn an exceeding &s;weet Picture of Society, and you know I'm but a Fool and a Novice in &s;uch Matters. But, if any other Man breathing, had given me &s;uch a De&s;cription,
<PB N="85" REF="84">I &s;hould, from all my little Reading, have with&s;tood him to the Face. Look through all the States and A&s;&s;ociations that ever were upon Earth; throughout the Repub|lics of <HI>Greece, Italy, A&s;ia</HI> Minor, and Others, the mo&s;t renowned for Urbanity and Vir|tue, and yet, what do you find them, &s;ave &s;o many Bands of public Robbers and Murderers, confederated for the De&s;truc|tion of the re&s;t of Mankind? what De|&s;olations, what Blood&s;hed, what Carnage from the Beginning! what a Delight in Horrors! what a Propen&s;ity in All to inflict Mi&s;ery upon Others! the Malignity of the Fiends can, I think, pierce no deeper!</P>
<P>Neither is this, Sir, as I take it, the Extent of their Malevolence. For, when any of the&s;e Bands, or States as you call them, have conquered or &s;laughtered all around them, they never fail, for want of Employment, to fall out among them|&s;elves, and cut the Throat of their very Confederates; and this puts me in mind of what is &s;aid by the Prince of Peace, <HI>the Prince of this World cometh and has no Part in me.</HI> And again he &s;ays to the Purpo&s;e, that Fathers and Sons, and Mothers and Daughters &s;hall be divided again&s;t Each Other, and that <HI>a Man's Enemies &s;hall be tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;ehold.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="85">
I lately met with a Fragment of an epic Poem, it &s;truck me wonderfully at the time, and I recollect &s;ome of the Lines that con|tain, in my Opinion, the mo&s;t genuine, the true&s;t Picture that ever was drawn of the &s;tate of Mankind.</P>

</LG>
<P>Say then, my deare&s;t Father, tell me, whence comes this wor&s;e than flinty, this cruel Heartedne&s;s in Man? Why are not All like You? Why are they not happy in communicating Happine&s;s? If my Eyes did not daily &s;ee it, in Fact, as well as in Hi&s;tory, I &s;hould think it impo&s;&s;ible that any One &s;hould derive Plea&s;ure from giv|ing Pain to Another. Can it be more ble&s;&s;ed to de&s;troy than to pre&s;erve, to afflict than to gladden, to wound than to heal? My Heart wrings with Regret for being ca&s;t into a World, where Nation again&s;t Nation, Family again&s;t Family, and Man again&s;t Man, are perpetually embattled, grudging, coveting, gra&s;ping, tearing every Enjoyment, every Property, and Life it&s;elf from Each-other.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Harry,</HI> for a while, held his Hand|kerchief to his Eyes; while his fond Uncle dropt a &s;ilent Tear of Delight, at beholding the amiable Emotion of his Beloved.</P>
<P>Take Care, my <HI>Harry,</HI> rejoined Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> beware of the &s;malle&s;t Tincture of Uncharitablene&s;s? You &s;ee only the wor&s;e Part, the outward Shell of this World;
<PB N="88" REF="87">while the Kernel, the better Part is con|cealed from your Eyes. There are Millions of worthy People and affectionate Saints upon Earth; but they are as a Kingdom within a Kingdom, a Grain within a Hu&s;k; it requires a kindred Heart and a curious Eye to di&s;cover them. Evil in Man is like Evil in the Elements; Earthquakes, Hur|ricanes, Thunders, and Lightnings are con&s;picuous, noi&s;y, glaring; while Good|ne&s;s, like Warmth and Moi&s;ture, is &s;ilent and unperceived, though productive of all the Beauties and Benefits in Nature.</P>
<P>I once told you, my Darling, that all the Evil which is in you belongs to your|&s;elf, and that all the Good which is in you belongs to your God. That you cannot, in or of your&s;elf, &s;o much as think a good Thought, or form a good Wi&s;h, or oppo&s;e a &s;ingle Temptation or evil Motion of any kind. And, what I then &s;aid of You may equally be &s;aid of all Men, and of the highe&s;t Angels now in Bli&s;s.</P>
<P>No Creature can be better than <HI>a craving and dark De&s;ire.</HI> No Efforts of its own can po&s;&s;ibly kindle the &s;malle&s;t Portion of Light or of Love; till God, by giving him&s;elf, gives his Light and Love into it.</P>
<P>Here lies the eternal Difference between Evil and Good, between the Creature and
<PB N="89" REF="88">the Creator; the Spirits who are now in Darkne&s;s, are there for no other Rea&s;on, but for their De&s;ire of a proud and impo&s;&s;i|ble Independence, for their rejecting the Light and Love of that God, in whom, however, they live and move and have their de&s;olate Being.</P>
<P>God is already the Fullne&s;s of all po&s;&s;ible things; He has, therefore, all things to give, but nothing to de&s;ire. The Creature, while empty of God, is a wanting De&s;ire; it has all things to crave, but nothing to be&s;tow. No two Things, in the Univer&s;e, can be more oppo&s;ite, more contra&s;ted.</P>
<P>Remember, therefore, this Di&s;tinction in your&s;elf and all Others; remember that, when you feel or &s;ee any In&s;tance of Self|i&s;hne&s;s, you feel and &s;ee the coveting, grudging and grappling of the Creature: But that when you feel or &s;ee any In&s;tance of Benevolence, you feel and &s;ee the in|forming Influence of your God. All po&s;|&s;ible Vice and Malignity &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the One; all po&s;&s;ible Virtue, all po&s;&s;ible Beau|ty, all po&s;&s;ible Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the Other.</P>
<P>As God, alone is LOVE, and nothing but Love, no Arguments of our own can rea|&s;on Love into us, no Efforts of our own can po&s;&s;ibly attain it. It mu&s;t &s;pring up,
<PB N="90" REF="89">within us, from the divine Bottom or Source, wherein our Exi&s;tence &s;tands; and it mu&s;t break through the dark and narrow Womb of SELF, into Sentiments and Feelings of GOOD-WILL for Others, be|fore this CHILD OF GOD can be born into the World.</P>
<P>SELF is wholly a MISER, it contracts what it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and at the &s;ame time at|tracts all that it doth not po&s;&s;e&s;s. It at once &s;huts out Others from its own propo&s;ed Enjoyments, and would draw into its little Whirlpool whatever Others enjoy.</P>
<P>LOVE, on the contrary, is a <HI>Giving,</HI> not a <HI>Craving;</HI> an <HI>Expan&s;ion</HI> not a <HI>Contraction;</HI> it breaks in Pieces the conden&s;ing Circle of SELF, and goes forth in the Delightfulne&s;s of its De&s;ire to ble&s;s.</P>
<P>SELF is a poor, dark, and mi&s;erable Avaritiou&s;ne&s;s, incapable of enjoying what it hath, through its grappling and gra&s;ping at what it hath not. The Impo&s;&s;ibility of its holding all things makes it envious of Tho&s;e who are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any thing, and Envy kindles the Fire of Hell, Wrath, and Wretchedne&s;s throughout its Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>LOVE, on the other Hand, is rich, en|lightening, and full of Delight. The Bounteou&s;ne&s;s of its Wi&s;hes makes the In|finity
<PB N="91" REF="90">of its Wealth. And it cannot fail of finding (without &s;eeking or requiring) its own Enjoyment, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, in its De|&s;ire to communicate and diffu&s;e Ble&s;&s;ing and Enjoyment.</P>
<P>But is it not, Sir, a very terrible thing, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> for poor Creatures to be evil, by the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Nature?</P>
<P>Why, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> how do you wi&s;h that Matters &s;hould have been ma|naged, my <HI>Harry?</HI></P>
<P>That All, Sir, at once, &s;hould have been made &s;o wi&s;e and good, as never po&s;|&s;ibly to be otherwi&s;e to all Eternity&mdash;What, infinitely wi&s;e, and powerful, and good, and happy?&mdash;As near to infinite, Sir, as po&s;&s;ibly could be.</P>
<P>Any thing le&s;s than infinite, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> mu&s;t fall infinitely &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing that God had made his Creatures infinitely and nece&s;&s;arily wi&s;e, powerful, and happy; then here would have been, as it were, an Infinity of di&s;tinct Beings and &s;eparate Wills, unmitted by any Connection, undi&s;ciplined and unarray|ed by any Subordination; and, &s;hould any Cau&s;e of Contention ari&s;e among them, the Univer&s;e mu&s;t have been turned into a
<PB N="92" REF="91">more horrible Hell than Any that Fancy hath ever yet formed.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> I &s;ee, in all Lights, that my Wi&s;h was ab&s;urd, impo&s;&s;ible, and ridiculous.</P>
<P>Your Error, my <HI>Harry,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in this. You took the Emptine&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and De&s;ire, in the Creature, to be the Evil of the Creature. They are, indeed, the only po&s;&s;ible Cau&s;e of Evil, in or to any Crea|ture, but they are exceedingly far from being an Evil, in them&s;elves; they are, on the contrary, the only, the nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;able Foundation, whereon any Creaturely Benefit can be built. It is extremely good for the Creature to be <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> and <HI>empty,</HI> and <HI>dark,</HI> and <HI>de&s;iring;</HI> for, hereby, he becomes a Capa|city, for being &s;upplied with all the <HI>Riches, Powers, Glories,</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> of his God.</P>
<P>As God is, every where (in and of him|&s;elf) the Fullne&s;s of all po&s;&s;ible Beings and Beatitudes, he cannot create any thing inde|pendent or out of him&s;elf; they cannot be but by being both in him and by him. Could it be otherwi&s;e, could any Creature be wi&s;e, or powerful, or happy, in and of it&s;elf, what a poor and &s;tinted Happine&s;s mu&s;t that have been; its Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, in that Ca&s;e, mu&s;t have been limited, like its
<PB N="93" REF="92">Being; and how infinitely, my Child, &s;hould we then have fallen &s;hort of <HI>that eter|nal Weight of Glory</HI> intended for us. But God has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to provide better things. If we humbly and de&s;irou&s;ly depend upon him, we become entitled to All that he has and that he is. He will enlighten our Darkne&s;s with his own Illumi|nation; he will inform our Ignorance with his own Wi&s;dom; his Omnipotence will become the Strength of our Weakne&s;s; He, him&s;elf, will be our Rectitude and Guide from all Error; He will purify our Pollution; put his own Robe on our Na|kedne&s;s; enrich our Poverty with the Heart-felt Trea&s;ures of him&s;elf; and we &s;hall be as &s;o many Mirrors, wherein our divine Friend and Father &s;hall delight to behold the expre&s;s Image of his own Per&s;on, his own Perfections and Beatitudes repre|&s;ented for ever!</P>
<P>O Sir, exclaimed <HI>Harry,</HI> how you glad|den, how you tran&s;port me! I &s;hall now no longer repine at my own Weakne&s;s, or Blindne&s;s, or Ignorance, or In&s;ufficiency of any Kind; &s;ince all the&s;e are but as &s;o ma|ny Ve&s;&s;els prepared to contain Pearls of in|finite Price, even the Riches, the Enjoy|ment and Fullne&s;s of my God. Never will I &s;eek or de&s;ire, never will I accept any thing le&s;s than Him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93">
You mu&s;t, my Child, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> you are &s;till in the Fle&s;h, in a carnal and propertied World; your old Man mu&s;t be fed, though not pampered; it mu&s;t be mortified, but not &s;lain.</P>
<P>You read, in the third Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> how our fir&s;t Father lu&s;ted after the &s;en&s;ual Fruits of this World; how he wilfully broke the &s;ole Commandment of his God; how he added to his Apo&s;tacy the Guilt of a&s;|piring at Independence; how he tru&s;ted to the Promi&s;e and Virtue of Creatures for making him equal in Godhead to the Crea|tor; how in that Day he died the fearfulle&s;t of all Deaths, a Death to the Fountain of Life, Light and Love within him; and how his Eyes were opened to perceive the Change of his Body into Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, Cor|ruption, Di&s;ea&s;e, and Mortality, conform|able to the World, to which he had turned his Faith, and into which he had ca&s;t him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now, had Man continued in this State, his Spirit which had turned, from God, into its own creaturely Emptine&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and De&s;ire, mu&s;t have &s;o continued for ever, in its own Hell and Mi&s;ery, without the Po&s;&s;ibility of exciting or acquiring the &s;malle&s;t Spark of Benevolence or Virtue of any kind. But God, in Compa&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="95" REF="94"><HI>Adam,</HI> and more e&s;pecially in Compa&s;&s;ion to his yet un&s;inning Progeny, infu&s;ed, into his undying E&s;&s;ence, a &s;mall Embryon or Reconception of that lately forfeited Image which, in Creation, had born the perfect Likene&s;s of the Creator.</P>
<P>From hence ari&s;es the only Capacity of any Goodne&s;s in Man. And, according as we &s;uppre&s;s or quench, or encourage and fo&s;ter this heavenly Seed, or infant Offspring of God within us; in &s;uch Proportion we become evil, malignant and reprobate; or benevolent and replete with divine Pro|pen&s;ities and Affections.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Harry,</HI> let us turn our Eyes to our gro&s;s and outward Man, for, as I told you, it mu&s;t be cared for and &s;u&s;tained agreeable to its Nature; and it is well de|&s;erving of our Attention; for as much as it is the Hu&s;k, the Habitation and Temple of that Godlike Conception which, when matured, is to break forth into never ending Glory.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, this &s;ame outward Man is further to be regarded by us, for as much as his Infirmities, Frailties, Di&s;temperatures. Af|flictions, Aches, and Angui&s;hes are &s;o in|timately felt by his divine Inmate, that they occa&s;ionally excite tho&s;e thou&s;and &s;ocial Charities, Relations, and Endearments that,
<PB N="96" REF="95">with Links of golden Love, connect the Brotherhood of Man.</P>
<P>It is therefore worth while to enquire in|to the Claims and Rights of this clo&s;e, though gro&s;s Companion, at lea&s;t &s;o far as may be requi&s;ite for his nece&s;&s;ary, if not comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tance upon Earth.</P>
<P>We find that God has entru&s;ted him with <HI>Life, Liberty,</HI> and Strength to acquire <HI>Property</HI> for his Su&s;tenance. It is therefore his Duty to pre&s;erve all the&s;e Tru&s;ts invio|late; for, as they are wedded to his Nature, <HI>what God hath &s;o joined let no Man put a&s;under.</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e were not, my <HI>Harry,</HI> the natural, inheritable, and indefea&s;ible Rights of all Men, there would be no Wrong, no Inju&s;|tice, in depriving All you &s;hould meet, of their Liberty, their Lives, and Properties at Plea&s;ure. For, all Laws that were ever framed for the good Government of Men (even with the divine Decalogue) are no other than faint Tran&s;cripts of that eternal LAW OF BENEVOLENCE, which was writ|ten and again retraced in the Bo&s;om of the fir&s;t Man, and which all his Po&s;terity ought to ob&s;erve, without further Obligation.</P>
<P>The capital Apo&s;tle, Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> bears Te&s;timony, al&s;o, to the Impre&s;&s;ion of this
<PB N="97" REF="96">LAW OF RIGHTS on the Con&s;ciences and Hearts of all Men, where he &s;ays in the &s;econd Chapter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> <Q>Not the Hearers of the Law are ju&s;t before God, but the Doers of the Law &s;hall be ju&s;tified. For, when the Gen|tiles, which have not the Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law, The&s;e, having not the Law, are a Law unto them&s;elves.

<P>But Sir, interrupted <HI>Harry,</HI> I am quite a&s;toni&s;hed at the Falling-off of the Father of Mankind. So infinitely benefitted and obliged as he was, &s;o nece&s;&s;arily dependent al&s;o on his omnipotent Benefactor; how fooli&s;h, how ba&s;e, how ungrateful, how unpardonable, as I think, was his wonder|ful Apo&s;ta&s;y! Wretched Creatures that we are! no &s;ound Branch, to be &s;ure, could ever &s;pring from &s;o deba&s;ed, &s;o canker'd a Stock.</P>
<P>Let us not be prone to judge of Others, my <HI>Harry.</HI> I am confident, as I am of my Being, that had You or I been in the Ca&s;e and Place of <HI>Adam,</HI> we &s;hould have fallen in like Manner. He had an old and

<PB N="98" REF="99">a very &s;ubtile Adver&s;ary to deal with. He felt him&s;elf powerful, glorious and happy. He had no Notion that his pre&s;ent State could change for the wor&s;e. He was yet a Novice in Exi&s;tence. He could form no Conception of the Depravity, Pains, and Mortality that afterward en&s;ued. And he was &s;trongly tempted by &s;en&s;ual Objects from without, and by the Emotions of his creaturely Nature within him. But, of this I am a&s;&s;ured, <HI>Harry,</HI> that, if he was the greate&s;t Sinner, he was al&s;o the greate&s;t and mo&s;t contrite Penitent that ever exi&s;t|ed; as the Compari&s;on of his fir&s;t, with his latter State, mu&s;t have given him the mo&s;t poignant and bitter Compunctions, and mu&s;t have cau&s;ed him, with tenfold Energy, to cling to that Rock, from which he was hewn, but from whence he had fallen.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn you, <HI>Harry,</HI> that every Man has a Right in his Per&s;on and Property, and that this Right is natural, inheritable, and indefea&s;able. No Con&s;ent of Parties, no In&s;titution can make any Change in this great and fundamental Law of Right; it is univer&s;al, invariable, and unalienable to any Man or Sy&s;tem of Men. It is only defea&s;able in particular Ca&s;es, as where one Man, by a&s;&s;ailing the Safety of Another, ju&s;tly forfeits the Title which he had to his own Safety.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">
If human Nature had never fallen into a State of inordinate Appetence, all Laws and legal Re&s;traints would have been as needle&s;s and impertinent as the Study and Practice of Phy&s;ic, in a Country exempted from Mortality and Di&s;ea&s;e. But, for as much as all Men are Tyrants by Nature, All prone to covet and gra&s;p at the Rights of Others; the great Law of SAFETY TO ALL can no otherwi&s;e be a&s;&s;ured, than BY THE RESTRAINT OF EACH FROM DOING INJURY TO ANY.</P>
<P>On this lamentable Occa&s;ion, on this &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity of Man's calling for Help again&s;t Man, is founded every Intention and End of civil Government. All Laws that do not branch from this Stem are canker'd or rotten.

Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> I have hear'd &s;ome very learned Men affirm, that God, in whom is the Di&s;po&s;al of all Lives and all Properties, has given to Some a Right of ruling over Others. That Governours are his Vicege|rents and Repre&s;entatives upon Earth. And that he hath appointed the de&s;cendi|ble and hereditary Rights of Fathers over Families, of Patriarchs over Tribes, and of Kings over Nations.</P>
<P>In a qualified Sen&s;e, my <HI>Harry,</HI> their Af|firmation may be ju&s;t. All the Agents and In&s;truments and Di&s;pen&s;ers of Beneficence, whether their Sphere be &s;mall or great, are God's true Repre&s;entatives and Vicegerents upon Earth. He hath given Authority to the Tenderne&s;s of Parents over their Pro|geny; and he hath inve&s;ted Patriarchs and Kings with the Rights of Protection. But God never gave the Vulture a Right to rule over the Dove-cote. Never gave up the innocent Many for a Prey to the tyran|nous Few. God never can take Plea&s;ure in the Breaches of the Law of his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Benignity. Arbitrary Regents are no further of his Appointment than the Evils of Earthquakes and Hurri|canes, as where he is &s;aid <HI>to give the Wicked a King in his Anger;</HI> and <HI>to &s;et over the Na|tions the Ba&s;e&s;t of Men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">
The God of all Right cannot will Wrong to Any. <HI>His Service is perfect Freedom.</HI> It is his Plea&s;ure to deliver from <HI>the Land of Slavery and the Hou&s;e of Bondage.</HI> He is the God of Equity and Good-Will to all his Creatures. He founds his own Autho|rity, not in Power but Beneficence. The Law, therefore, of Safety and Well-being to All, is founded in the Nature of God him&s;elf, <HI>eternal, immutable,</HI> and <HI>indi&s;pen|&s;able.</HI></P>
<P>One Man may abound in Strength, Au|thority, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; but no Man may have greater Right than Another. The Beggar has as much Right to his Cloak and his Scrip, as the King to his Ermines and Crown Lands.</P>
<P>To fence and to e&s;tabli&s;h this divinely inherent Right, of SECURITY TO THE PERSON and PROPERTY OF MAN, has been the Study and Attempt of <HI>Hermes, Confucius, Minos, Lycurgus, Solon, Numa,</HI> and of all the Legi&s;lators and Sy&s;tems of civil Polity, that ever warmed the World with a &s;ingle Ray of Freedom.</P>
<P>But, &s;o &s;trong is the Propen&s;ity to U&s;ur|pation in Man; &s;o dangerous is it to tempt Tru&s;tees with the Inve&s;titure of Power; &s;o

<P><HI>Monarchy</HI> has ever been found to ru&s;h headlong into Tyranny; <HI>Ari&s;tocracy</HI> into Faction and multiplied U&s;urpation; and <HI>Democracy</HI> into Tumult, Confu&s;ion and Violence. And All the&s;e, whether di&s;tinct or compounded with Each-other, have ended in the Supremacy of &s;ome arbitrary Tyrant, enabled, by a Body of military Mercenaries, to rule, oppre&s;s, and &s;poil the People at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>How <HI>England</HI> hath come, after the many Wrecks and Ruins which you have read of in Hi&s;tory, to &s;urvive, to recover, to grow &s;ounder from her Wounds, and mightier from her Di&s;comfitures; and to ri&s;e &s;upe|rior, as we tru&s;t, to all future external and internal Attempts, hath been owing to the Peculiarity of her Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Her Con&s;titution, it is true, is not yet quit, perhaps never ought to be quit of &s;ome inte&s;tine Commotions. For, though Liberty has no Relation to Party, Di&s;&s;enti|on, or Cabal again&s;t Government; there
<PB N="103" REF="104">is yet a Kind of Ye&s;t ob&s;ervable in its Na|ture, which may be nece&s;&s;ary to the fer|mentation and working up of Virtue to the Degree that is requi&s;ite for the Produc|tion of Patrioti&s;m and public-Spirit. But, when this <HI>Ye&s;t of Liberty</HI> happens to light upon weak or vapid Tempers, they are immediately affected, like Small-beer Ca&s;ks, and rave and boil over in an Abundance of factious Sputter and Turbulence. Party and Faction therefore, being the Scum and Ebullition of this animating Ye&s;t, are &s;ure Signs and Proofs of the Life of Liberty, though they neither partake nor commu|nicate any Portion of its Beneficence; as rank Weeds are the Proof of a hot Sun and luxuriant Soil, though they are the dete&s;table Con&s;equence of the One and the Other.</P>
<P>I will endeavour to image and exempli|fy to you the Nature and Tendency of the&s;e Commotions, by bringing &s;ome of our old Plays to the Memory of my <HI>Harry.</HI></P>

<P>Your favourite Play of FOOT-BALL is a mo&s;t perfect Image, or rather Counterpart, of tho&s;e Di&s;&s;entions and Oppo&s;itions that are entitled <HI>Parties,</HI> and which are al|mo&s;t peculiar to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Parties</HI> for FOOT-BALL are formed, Each enters as affectionately, as zealou&s;ly, as furiou&s;ly in the Intere&s;ts of All, and Every of the Po&s;&s;e, with whom he is connected, as though they were &s;o many Limbs of his proper Per&s;on. Though Town&s;men, Friends, Brothers &s;hould be arrayed on the oppo&s;ite Side, it makes no Abatement of Warmth or Ho&s;tility. All Concerns of Kindred and Country, all Me|mory of former Attachments are in&s;tantly ca&s;t a&s;ide, or ab&s;orbed in the Engagement and Eagerne&s;s for Conque&s;t. They enter upon Action; they run, labour, &s;weat, wre&s;tle. While the BALL, which each Party endeavours to bear away from the Other, repre&s;ents the PUBLIC INTEREST or COMMON-WEAL, which is to&s;&s;ed and bandied to and fro, and kicked about, and almo&s;t rent to Rags in the Heat of the Contention.</P>
<P>It is, however, ob&s;ervable that, in the&s;e FOOT-BALL Conflicts, there are certain
<PB N="106" REF="107">BOUNDARIES entitled GOALS, emblema|tical of the CONSTITUTION, within which the Parties are enjoined to limit their Con|tention: And when &s;ome extravagant and di&s;&s;olute Spirits have, wantonly, born a|way the Ball beyond the &s;aid Bounds, we have &s;een both Parties join in Pur&s;uit of &s;uch Vagrants, in order to recover and bring back the Ball to the regulated and appointed Sphere of its Activity.</P>

<P>Now, <HI>Harry,</HI> let us return to the great Object fir&s;t propo&s;ed, an Object in which you are mo&s;t intimately concerned; and
<PB N="107" REF="108">which, I tru&s;t, you will invariably a&s;&s;ert and &s;upport, even the Liberties and Claims of the Meane&s;t of your Countrymen.</P>
<P>SALUS POPULI&mdash;PUBLIC SAFETY&mdash;SECURITY TO THE PERSONS AND PRO|PERTIES OF THE PEOPLE; con&s;titutes the Whole of <HI>England</HI>'s Polity. Her Empire is IMPERIUM LEGUM, the Sway of Law; it is the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Beneficence, of e|qual Right to All; and this Empire ri&s;es &s;upreme over King, Lords, and Commo|ners, and is appointed to rule the Rulers, to the End of Time.</P>
<P>Other States, before now, have been compounded like Ours, of <HI>Prince, Peers, and People,</HI> the <HI>One, Few, and Many</HI> united. But the Error and Failure of their Con&s;ti|tution was this: The PEOPLE, who are the FOUNTAIN OF ALL POWER, either retained, in their own Hands, an Autho|rity which they never were qualified to wield; or deputed it to Tru&s;tees without Account; without a provident Re&s;ource or due Re&s;erve of Potency, when <HI>Tho&s;e en|tru&s;ted with Government &s;hould be found to be|tray.</HI></P>
<P>The People of <HI>England,</HI> on the contrary, claim no Authority in Government; neither in the framing, admini&s;tration, or executi|on of the Laws, by which they con&s;ent to be
<PB N="108" REF="109">governed. They are them&s;elves imaged and as it were epitomi&s;ed, in their three &s;everal E&s;tates. The King repre&s;ents their Maje&s;ty; the Lords their Nobility; and the Commons, more immediately, their legi&s;lative Power. The Con&s;titution is the Inheritance of them and their Po&s;teri|ty; and theirs is the Right and Duty, at all Times, to watch over, a&s;&s;ert, and reclaim it. Wherefore, as you find in Hi&s;tory, when Any of the three E&s;tates have u&s;urped upon the Others; even when All of them to|gether have dared to violate the Frame of this &s;alutary Con&s;titution; the People, to whom it belongs, have never failed, as on the other Day's Revolution, to re&s;tore and rein&s;tate it.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI>'s three E&s;tates, of King, Lords, and Commons, are Parts of the People, under Covenant with the People, and ac|countable to the People; but the People, as a People, make not any of the &s;aid E&s;tates. They are as a perpetual Foun|tain from whence the three E&s;tates ari&s;e; or rather as a Sea of Waters, in which three exalted Waves &s;hould claim Preeminence; which yet &s;hall not be able to depart from their Fund, but, in Rotation, are di&s;&s;olu|ble and re&s;olvable therein.</P>
<P>Thus, however complicated the Sy&s;tem of <HI>England</HI>'s Polity may be, it is all rooted
<PB N="109" REF="110">in and branches from the TRUST OF THE PEOPLE, the Tru&s;t of Powers which they have granted to be returned in Protection. And, in Truth, it makes little Difference whether the Powers, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, be granted or a&s;&s;umed: Whoever either re|ceives or a&s;&s;umes &s;uch Powers, &s;ave to the Ends of Beneficence, is equally guilty of U&s;urpation and Tyranny.</P>
<P>Government can have no Powers, &s;ave the Powers of the People; to wit, the Power of their Numbers, Strength, and Courage, in Time of War, and in Peace, of their Art and Indu&s;try, and the Wealth ari&s;ing therefrom. Whoever a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the&s;e Powers, or any Part thereof, without the Con&s;ent of the Proprietors, is a Robber, and &s;hould, at lea&s;t, be dive&s;ted of the Spoil.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if &s;uch Powers are granted by the People, the People cannot granted them for Purpo&s;es to which they, them&s;elves, cannot lawfully apply them. No Man, for In&s;tance, can arbitrarily di&s;|po&s;e of his own Life or Liberty, neither of the whole Product of his own Labours; fora&s;much as the Lives of him&s;elf and his Family &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;u&s;tained thereby, and his Obligations to Others fairly and fully di&s;charged. He cannot, therefore,
<PB N="110" REF="111">grant an arbitrary Di&s;po&s;al of what he hath not an arbitrary Di&s;po&s;al in him&s;elf. Much le&s;s can any Man grant a Power over the Lives, Liberties, or Properties of other People, as it would be criminal and high|ly puni&s;hable in him&s;elf to a&s;&s;ail them.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, as evident as any Ob|ject at Noon, that <HI>no Man or Body of Men can rightfully a&s;&s;ume,</HI> or even accept, <HI>what no Man or Body of Men can rightfully grant,</HI> to wit, a Power that is arbitrary or inju|rious to Others. And hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that all U&s;urpations of &s;uch Pow|ers, throughout the Earth; with all actual or pretended Covenants, Tru&s;ts, or Grants, for the Inve&s;titure or Conveyance of &s;uch illicit Powers, are null and void, on the Execution. And that no Man, or Nations of Men, can po&s;&s;ibly be bound by any Con&s;ents or Contracts ever&s;ive of the Laws of God and their own Nature, of common Sen&s;e and general Equity, of eternal Rea|&s;on and Truth.</P>
<P>I beg Pardon, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> for inter|rupting you once more, but you de&s;ire that I &s;hould always &s;peak my Mind with Freedom. You have delighted me greatly with the Account which you give of the Benefits and Sweets of <HI>Liberty,</HI> and of its being equally the Claim and Birth-Right of all Men; and I wi&s;h to Heaven that they

<P>O Sir, if this divine, this GOLDEN LAW OF LIBERTY were ob&s;erved, if ALL WERE RESTRAINED FROM DOING INJURY TO ANY; what a Heaven we &s;hould &s;pee|dily have upon Earth! the Habit of &s;uch a Re&s;traint would, in time, &s;uppre&s;s every Emotion to Evil.

<P>How has the &s;acred Name of All-bene|fitting LIBERTY been perverted and pro|faned, by the Mouths of madding Dema|gogues at the Head of their &s;houting Rab|ble, who mean no Other than a licentious Unmuzzling from all Re&s;traint, that they may ravage and lay de&s;olate the Works and Fruits of Peace.</P>

But Liberty, in your Sy&s;tem, is a real an e&s;&s;ential Good; the only Source, indeed, whence any Good can ari&s;e. I &s;ee it, I re|vere it, it &s;hines by its own Light in the Evidence of your De&s;cription.</P>
<P>How is it then, Sir, that there are Per|&s;ons &s;o blind, or &s;o bigotted again&s;t their own Intere&s;ts and Tho&s;e of their Fellows, as to declaim with much Energy and &s;tudied Argumentation again&s;t this divine, inheritable, and indefei&s;ible Right (not of Kings as &s;hould &s;eem) but of Human|kind?</P>
<P>I lately happened in Company with a Number of di&s;contentedly looking Gentle|men, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to have been Abet|tors of the late King <HI>James,</HI> and Friends to the arrogating Family of the <HI>Stuarts.</HI> Among them was One of &s;ome Learning and great Cleverne&s;s, and he paraded and &s;hewed away, at a va&s;t Rate, concerning the divinely inherent Right of Monarchs, implicit Submi&s;&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, and what not.</P>
<P>Our God, &s;aid he, is one God; and the Sub&s;titutes of his Mightine&s;s &s;hould re|&s;emble him&s;elf; their Power ought to be ab&s;olute, unque&s;tioned, and undivided. The Sun is his glorious Repre&s;entative in
<PB N="113" REF="114">the Heavens, and Monarchs are his Re|pre&s;entatives and Mirrors, upon Earth, in whom he is plea&s;ed to behold the Reflec|tion of his own Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Accordingly we find that the Monarchs, over his cho&s;en People, were of his &s;pecial Appointment, and that their Per&s;ons were render'd &s;acred and awfully inviolable, by Unction or the &s;hedding of hallowed Oil upon them. Many Mi&s;carriages and woful Defaults are recorded of <HI>Saul,</HI> as a Man, yet, as a King, he was held perfect in the Eyes of his People. What an unhe&s;itating Obedience, what a &s;peechle&s;s Submi&s;&s;ion do they pay to all his Behe&s;ts! Though he ma&s;&s;acred their whole Prie&s;thood, to a Man, in one Day, yet no Murmur was hear'd; no One dared to wag a Tongue, and much le&s;s to lift a Finger a|gain&s;t the Lord's Anointed.</P>
<P>I own to you, Sir, that this la&s;t Argu|ment &s;taggered me; &s;uch an expre&s;s Au|thority of the &s;acred Writings put me wholly to Silence. Say then, my deare&s;t Father, give me the Benefit of your en|lightening Sentiments on this Head; that I may know, on all Occa&s;ions, to give, to all Men, <HI>an Account of the political Faith that is in me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">
It is extremely &s;urprizing, rejoined Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> that all our Lay and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Champions for arbitrary Power, who have rai&s;ed &s;uch a Du&s;t, and kept &s;uch a Coil about the <HI>divine, hereditary,</HI> and <HI>indefei&s;i|ble Right</HI> of Kings, and the <HI>unconditional Duty</HI> of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> in the Subject, have founded their whole Pile of Argu|ment and Oratory, on the DIVINE AP|POINTMENT of the Regal Government of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as the perfect Model and En&s;ample whereby all other States are, in like Manner, required to form their re&s;|pective Governments.</P>
<P>Now, if the&s;e Champions had engaged, on the oppo&s;ite Side of the Que&s;tion, and had undertaken the Argument again&s;t <HI>arbitrary Power,</HI> they could not have done it more effectually, more conclu&s;ively, more unan&s;werably, than by &s;hewing that ARBITRARY POWER was the very EVIL &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to the Nature of God, that he exhibited his Omnipotence, in a Series of public and a&s;toni&s;hing Wonders, in or|der to deliver this very People from the Grievance thereof; and, more e&s;pecially to proclaim to all Nations and Ages the Dete&s;tation in which his ETERNAL JUS|TICE holds all <HI>lawle&s;s Di&s;pen&s;ations,</HI> all Acts of SOVEREIGN POWER that are not Acts of PROTECTION.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116">
Could the&s;e Champions, again, have better enforced the Argument again&s;t <HI>arbi|trary Power,</HI> than by &s;hewing that this People, &s;o miraculou&s;ly enfranchi&s;ed, but now fat and wantonly kicking under the Indulgence of their God, had taken a Loath|ing to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Di&s;pen&s;a|tions of their Deliverer, <HI>had rejected him</HI> (as he affirms) <HI>from reigning over them;</HI> and had required a KING, like to the Kings of the neighbouring Nations? the very EVIL from which God had redeemed their Fore|fathers.</P>
<P>Could the&s;e Champions, further, have better demon&s;trated the Mi&s;eries, the Ini|quities, the Abominations of &s;uch a Go|vernment, than by reciting the Expo&s;tula|tions, the tender and earne&s;t Remon&s;trances of God him&s;elf, on the Sufferings that the&s;e Rebels were about to bring upon them|&s;elves from the Enormities of an arbitrary and unlimited Sovereignty? And, la&s;tly, could they have better recommended, to the Free and the Virtuous, to &s;tand out, to the Death, again&s;t arbitrary Oppre&s;&s;ion, than by &s;hewing the Ob&s;tinacy of the&s;e apo&s;tate <HI>Jews,</HI> when they an&s;wered to the compa&s;&s;ionating Expo&s;tulations of their God&mdash;<HI>Nay, but we will have a</HI> KING, <HI>like all the Nations, to rule over us.</HI></P>

Nothing, my <HI>Harry,</HI> can be more unac|countable, more a&s;toni&s;hing, than the Per|ver&s;ene&s;s of that &s;tiffnecked Nation.</P>

<P>Hereupon, God gave them Fle&s;h and Bread to the full; and he brought them into a Land <HI>flowing with Milk and Honey,</HI> and abounding with all the good things of this Life.

<Q><P>And the Lord &s;aid unto <HI>Samuel,</HI> hearken unto the Voice of the People in all that they &s;ay unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I &s;hould not reign over them.

<P>And <HI>Samuel</HI> told all the Words of the Lord unto the People that a&s;ked of him a King. And he &s;aid, this will be the Manner of the King that &s;hall reign over You.</P>

<P>And now, <HI>Harry,</HI> what do you gather from all the&s;e &s;acred Authorities? I gather, Sir, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> from the expre&s;s and repeated Declarations of holy Writ, that, whoever he be, whether Sovereign or Sub|ject, who doth not wi&s;h that all Men &s;hould be limited and re&s;trained from doing Injury to Any, is a Rebel to the Will of the God of BENEFICENCE, and an Ene|my to the WELLBEING OF HUMAN|KIND.</P>
<P>You have, exclaimed Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> You have, in a few Words, &s;poke the Whole of the Matter. On what you have &s;aid hang all the Law and the Prophets.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">
Again, my Dear, continued Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> it is evident from the Hi&s;tory, that the <HI>Jews,</HI> them&s;elves, did not pay the &s;malle&s;t Regard to the <HI>divinely hereditary Right of King&s;hip.</HI> Both <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> the &s;econd and third in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on the Throne in direct Contradic|tion to &s;uch <HI>pretended Right.</HI> And on the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> the fourth King, ten of the twelve Tribes repented of their Submi&s;&s;ion to an <HI>arbitrary Monarchy,</HI> and re|quired the King to con&s;ent to a <HI>Limitation of his Authority,</HI> and to enter into a <HI>Contract with the People.</HI></P>
<P><Q>And they &s;pake unto <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> &s;ay|ing, thy Father made our Yoke grie|vous: Now therefore make thou the grievous Service of thy Father and his heavy Yoke, which he put upon us, lighter, and we will &s;erve thee.</Q></P>
<P>But, when <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> by the Advice of his &s;leek-headed Mini&s;try, refu&s;ed to cove|nant with the People, the ten Tribes cried out, <Q>What Portion have we in <HI>David?</HI> neither have we Inheritance in the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e;</HI> to your Tents, O <HI>I&s;rael!</HI></Q> And thus the ten Tribes revolted from the arbi|trary Domination of the Hou&s;es of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David.</HI> For, as the &s;acred Text &s;ays, THE CAUSE WAS FROM THE LORD.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">
Now, when the&s;e ten Tribes &s;ent and called <HI>Jeroboam:</HI> he Son of <HI>Nelat,</HI> and made him King over <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> it is mo&s;t evident that they obliged him to <HI>limit the regal Au|thority,</HI> and to covenant with them for the Re&s;toration and <HI>Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of their Po|pular Rights. For, in the &s;ixth Succe&s;&s;ion, when <HI>Ahab</HI> &s;at upon the Throne, the <HI>Regal Prerogative</HI> had not, yet, &s;o far u&s;urped on the <HI>con&s;titutional Rights of the People,</HI> as to entitle <HI>Ahab</HI> to deprive his Subjects even of a Garden for Herbs.</P>
<P><Q>And <HI>Ahab</HI> &s;aid unto <HI>Naboth,</HI> give me thy Vineyard, that I may have it for a Garden of Herbs, becau&s;e it is near unto my Hou&s;e; and I will give thee for it a better Vineyard; or if it &s;eems good to thee, I will give thee the Worth of it in Money. But, <HI>Naboth</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Ahab,</HI> the Lord forbid that I &s;hould give the Inheri|tance of my Fathers unto thee. So <HI>Ahab</HI> came into his Hou&s;e heavy di&s;plea&s;ed, becau&s;e <HI>Naboth</HI> had &s;aid I will not give to thee the Inheritance of my Fathers: And he laid him down upon his Bed, and turned away his Face, and would eat no Bread.</Q></P>
<P>Here, we &s;ee that the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had &s;o far recovered their <HI>originally inherent
<PB N="121" REF="122">and hereditary Rights,</HI> that the <HI>Regal E&s;tate</HI> had not the Privilege of wre&s;ting, from any Subject, &s;o much as an Herb-Garden.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying Circum&s;tance to royal Elevation; but Power is &s;eldom un|fruitful of Expedients. A Method was found of rending away <HI>Naboth</HI>'s Property (without his Con&s;ent) UNDER COLOUR OF THE LAW TO WHICH HE HAD CONSENT|ED. He was fal&s;ely impeached, and for|feited his Life and Inheritance together. But God, by the &s;ignal Puni&s;hment which he inflicted, for this Breach on <HI>the natural Rights of his People,</HI> evinced to the World how dear they are in the Eye of ETERNAL JUSTICE.</P>
<P>How deplorable then, my <HI>Harry,</HI> is the <HI>Suppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the&s;e Rights, now nearly <HI>univer&s;al</HI> throughout the Earth. But when People, from their Infancy, and from Ge|neration to Generation, have been habi|tuated to Bondage, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion; without any Tradition or Memo|rial delivered down to them, of a happier or more equitable Manner of Life; they are accu&s;tomed to look on them&s;elves, their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and their Progeny, as the rightful Property of their Rulers, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at Plea&s;ure; and they no more regret the want of a LIBERTY, that they
<PB N="122" REF="123">never knew, than the Blind-Born regret the want of THE LIGHT OF THE SUN.</P>
<P>Before I give You this Paper that I have in my Hand, this Epitome or Picture in Miniature of the incomparable Beauties of the <HI>Britanic</HI> Con&s;titution, it may be re|qui&s;ite to premi&s;e a few Matters.</P>
<P>Travellers, when they &s;urvey a grand <HI>Egyptian</HI> Pyramid, are apt to enquire by whom the &s;tupendous Pile was erected, and how long it hath &s;tood the A&s;&s;aults of Time? But, when nothing of this can be developed, Imagination runs back through Antiquity, without Bounds; and thence contemplates an Object, with peculiar Ve|neration, that appears as it were to have had no Beginning.</P>
<P>Such a Structure is the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> No Records di&s;cover when it had a Commencement; neither can any Annals &s;pecify the Time at which it was not.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman,</HI> above &s;even hun|dred Years ago, on his entering into the ORIGINAL CONTRACT with the People, engaged to govern them according to the <HI>bonae et approbatae antiquae Regni Leges,</HI> the good well approved and <HI>ancient</HI> Laws of
<PB N="123" REF="124">the Kingdom, this Con&s;titution was there|fore ancient, even in <HI>ancient Times.</HI></P>
<P>More than eighteen hundred Years are now elap&s;ed &s;ince <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> in the &s;ixth Book of his Commentaries, bore Te&s;ti|mony as well to the Antiquity as Excel|lency of the Sy&s;tem of the Laws of <HI>Bri|tain.</HI> He tells us that the venerable Or|der of the <HI>Druids,</HI> who then admini&s;tered Ju&s;tice throughout <HI>Gaul,</HI> derived their Sy&s;tem of Government from <HI>Britain;</HI> and that it was cu&s;tomary for Tho&s;e, who were de&s;irous of being ver&s;ed in the &s;aid ancient In&s;titutions, to go over to <HI>Britain</HI> for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;eems to recommend, while he &s;pecifies, one of the Laws that was then pe|culiar to the Con&s;titution of <HI>Britain.</HI> He tells You that, if a Woman was &s;u&s;pected of the Death of her Hu&s;band, &s;he was que&s;tioned thereupon with &s;everity <HI>by her Neighbours;</HI> and that, if &s;he was &s;ound guilty, &s;he was tied alive to a Stake and burned to Death. The very Law u&s;ed in Britain, <HI>by a Jury of Neighbours,</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>It is, hence, very obvious that our <HI>Gothic</HI> Ance&s;tors either adopted what they judged excellent in the BRITISH CONSTI|TUTION,
<PB N="124" REF="125">or rather &s;uperadded what was deemed to be excellent in their Own.</P>
<P>The People who went under the gene|ral Name of <HI>Goths,</HI> were of many different Nations, who, from the <HI>Northern,</HI> poured down on the more <HI>Southern</HI> Parts of Eu|rope.</P>
<P>Their Kings were, originally, Chiefs or Generals, appointed to lead voluntary Armies, or Colonies, for the forming of new Settlements in foreign Lands; and they were followed by a free and indepen|dent Multitude, who had previou&s;ly &s;tipu|lated that they &s;hould &s;hare and enjoy the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which their Valour &s;hould con|quer.</P>
<P>Next to the General, in Order, the Officers or principal Men of the Army were attended, on &s;uch Expeditions, by their Kinsfolk, Friends, and Dependents, who cho&s;e to attach them&s;elves to their Per&s;ons and Fortunes, re&s;pectively; and &s;uch At|tachments gave the&s;e Officers great Power and Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>On their Conque&s;t or Seizure of any Tract of Country, a certain Portion there|of was allotted to the General, for the Maintenance of his Per&s;on and Hou&s;hold. The General then divided the Remainder
<PB N="125" REF="126">among his Officers, to hold of him, in <HI>Fief,</HI> at the certain Service of &s;o many Hor&s;e or Foot, well armed and provided, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and proportioned to the Value and Extent of the Land a&s;&s;igned. And the &s;aid Officers, again, parcelled out the greate&s;t Part of the &s;aid Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, among their re&s;pective Followers, to hold of them|&s;elves, in like Manner and Service as they held of their General.</P>
<P>On the Conque&s;t of a Country, they &s;eldom cho&s;e to exterminate the Natives or old Inhabitants, but allotted to them al&s;o &s;eparate Remnants of the Land; and admitted them to the common and equal Participation of &s;uch Laws or U&s;ages as they brought from their own Country, or cho&s;e to adopt.</P>
<P>Independant of the military Services above re&s;erved, the Prince or Chief, fur|ther, re&s;erved the civil Service or per&s;onal Attendance of his feudatory Officers, at certain Times and for certain Terms, at his general or national Court. This Court was compo&s;ed of <HI>three E&s;tates,</HI> the <HI>Prince,</HI> the <HI>Nobles,</HI> and &s;uch of the <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> whe|ther Pagan or Chri&s;tian, as held in <HI>Fief</HI> from the Prince; and, from this NATIO|NAL COUNCIL our PARLIAMENT took its Origin.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">
The feudal Officers al&s;o, on their Part, re&s;erved the like Service and per&s;onal At|tendance, of their proper Tenants and Va&s;&s;als, at their re&s;pective Courts of Judi|cature. And for as much as, in &s;uch Courts, no civil or criminal Sentence could take place, till the Voice of the Judge was affirmed by the <HI>Court,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch as were <HI>Peers,</HI> or <HI>Equals to the Party accu&s;ed;</HI> from thence we derive our free, ancient, and &s;acred In&s;titution of JURIES.</P>
<P>If we look back upon One of tho&s;e <HI>Fief</HI> or <HI>Feudal</HI> Kings, &s;eated high on his Throne, and encircled with all the En&s;igns of Royalty; when we find him entitled the &s;ole Proprietor of all the Lands within his Dominions; when we hear his Sub|jects acknowledge that he, alone, is the Fountain from whence are derived all Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Rights, Titles, Di&s;tinctions, and Dignities; when we &s;ee his mo&s;t po|tent Prefects and Nobles, with lifted Hands and bended Knees, &s;wearing Fealty at his Feet; who would not take him for an ar|bitrary and mo&s;t ab&s;olute Prince?</P>
<P>Such a Judgment, however, would have been very premature. No Prince could be more limited. He had not the Licen&s;e of doing Hurt to the Per&s;on or Property of the meane&s;t Va&s;&s;al throughout his Domi|nions.
<PB N="127" REF="128">But, was he the le&s;s powerful, think you, for being le&s;s ab&s;olute? quite the contrary. While he acted within the Sphere of his Compact with the People, he acted in all the Per&s;ons and Powers of the People. Tho' pre&s;cribed, with re&s;pect to Evil; the Extent of his Beneficence was wholly unconfined. He was not dreaded indeed, but, on that Account, he was the more revered and beloved by his Subjects. He was a Part of them&s;elves; the principal Member of their Body. In him they be|held, with delight, their own Dignity and Strength &s;o gloriou&s;ly repre&s;ented; and, by being the Proprietor of all their Hearts, he became the Ma&s;ter of all their Hands.</P>
<P>O, exclaimed <HI>Harry,</HI> who would wi&s;h, after this, to be unre&s;trained from any Kind of Evil? how frightful, how dete&s;table is that Power which is not exerci&s;ed in Acts of Benevolence alone! And All, who plea&s;e, may be infinite in the Stretch of a good Will.</P>

<P>THE KING, in the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is more properly the King <HI>of</HI> than a King <HI>over</HI> the People, united to them, One of them, and contain|ed in them.

<P>His Claim to the Throne is not a Claim, as of &s;ome Matter of Property or per&s;onal Right; he doth not claim but is claimed by the People in their Parliament; and he is claimed or called upon, not to the Inve&s;|titure of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but the Performance of Duties. He is called upon to govern the People according to the Laws by which they, them&s;elves, have con&s;ented to be go|verned; to cau&s;e Ju&s;tice and Mercy to be di&s;pen&s;ed throughout the Realm; and, to his utmo&s;t, to execute, protect, and main|tain the Laws of the Go&s;pel of God, and the Rights and Liberties of all the People without di&s;tinction. &mdash; And this he &s;wears on the Go&s;pel of God to perform &mdash; And thus, as all Others owe <HI>Allegiance</HI> to the King; <HI>the King him&s;elf oweth Allegiance to the Con&s;titution.</HI></P>

<P>Though the Claim of all Kings, to the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is a limited and de|&s;ea&s;ible Claim; yet the World can afford no Rival, in Power or Glory, to a <HI>con&s;ti|tutional</HI> Sovereign of the&s;e free Dominions.</P>
<P>For the Honour of their own Body, they have inve&s;ted this their Head with all po&s;&s;i|ble Illu&s;tration. He concentrates the Rays of many Nations. They have clothed him in royal Robes, and circled his Head with a Diadem, and enthroned him on high. And they bow down before the Mirror of their own Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132">
Neither are his the mere En&s;igns or ex|ternal Shews of Regency. He is inve&s;ted al&s;o with Powers, much more real than if they were ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>There are three capital Prerogatives, with which the King is entru&s;ted, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear of fearful and dange|rous Tendency; and which mu&s;t infallibly and quickly end in arbitrary Dominion, if they were not counterpoi&s;ed and counter|acted.</P>
<P>His principal Prerogative is to make War or Peace, as al&s;o Treaties, Leagues, and Alliances with foreign Potentates.</P>
<P>His &s;econd Prerogative is to nominate and appoint all Mini&s;ters and Servants of State, all Judges and Admini&s;trators of Ju&s;tice; and all Officers, civil or military, throughout the&s;e Realms.</P>
<P>His third capital Prerogative is, that he &s;hould have the whole executive Power of the Government of the&s;e Nations, by his &s;aid Mini&s;ters and Officers, both civil and military.</P>
<P>I might here al&s;o have added a fourth Prerogative, which mu&s;t have been capi|tally ever&s;ive of the Con&s;titution, had it not
<PB N="132" REF="133">been limited in the original Tru&s;t, I mean a Power of granting Pardon to Criminals. Had this Power been unre&s;trained, all Ob|ligations to Ju&s;tice might be ab&s;olved at the King's Plea&s;ure. An evil King might even encourage the Breach of Law. He mu&s;t, unque&s;tionably, have di&s;pen&s;ed with all illicit Acts that were perpetrated by his own Orders; and this A&s;&s;urance of Pardon mu&s;t, as unque&s;tionably, have encouraged all his Mini&s;ters and Officers to execute his Will as the only Rule of their Obedience.</P>
<P>But God, and our glorious Ance&s;tors be prai&s;ed! he is re&s;trained from protecting his be&s;t beloved Mini&s;ters, when they have effected or even imagined the Damage of the Con&s;titution. He is al&s;o limited in Ap|peals brought by the Subject for Murder or Robbery. But, on Indictments in his own Name, for Offences again&s;t his proper Per&s;on and Government, &s;uch as Rebellion, In&s;urrection, Riot, and Breaches of the Peace by Murder, Maim, or Robbery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> here he is at liberty to extend the Arm of his Mercy, fora&s;much as there are many Ca&s;es &s;o circum&s;tanced, &s;o admi&s;&s;ive of pi|tiable and palliating Con&s;iderations, that <HI>&s;ummum Jus,</HI> or &s;trict Ju&s;tice, might prove <HI>&s;umma Injuria,</HI> or extreme Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>All pardonable Offences are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Title of <HI>Crimina lae&s;ae Maje&s;tatis,
<PB N="133" REF="134">Sins again&s;t the King.</HI> All unpardonable Offences are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Title of <HI>Crimina lae&s;ae Libertatis, Sins again&s;t the Con&s;titution.</HI> In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, the Injury is pre&s;umed to extend no further than to One or a few Individuals; in the Second it is charged as a Sin again&s;t the Public, again&s;t the collective Body of the whole People. Of the latter Kind are Nui&s;ances that may endanger the Lives of Travellers on the High Way; but, more capitally, any Imagination, proved by Overt-Act or evil Advice, tending to change the Nature or Form of any One of the three E&s;tates; or tending to ve&s;t the Government, or the Admini&s;tration thereof, in any One, or any Two of the &s;aid E&s;tates independent of the Other; or tending to rai&s;e &s;tanding Ar|mies, or to continue them in time of Peace without the Con&s;ent of Parliament; or tend|ing to give any foreign State an Advantage over the&s;e Realms by Sea or by Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The King hath, al&s;o, annexed to his Dig|nity many further very important Powers and Prerogatives; though they do not &s;o intimately interfere with the Con&s;titution as the capital Prerogatives above recited.</P>
<P>He is fir&s;t con&s;idered as the original Pro|prietor of all the Lands in the&s;e Kingdoms; and he founds this Claim, as well on the Conque&s;t, by <HI>William the Norman,</HI> as by
<PB N="134" REF="135">the limited Kings or Leaders of our Gothie Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Hence it comes to pa&s;s that all Lands, to which no Subject can prove a Title, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in their original Owner; and are therefore, by the Con&s;titution, ve&s;ted in the Crown. On the &s;ame Principle, al&s;o, the King is entitled to the Lands of all Per|&s;ons who die without Heirs; as al&s;o to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of All who are convicted of Crimes &s;ubver&s;ive of the Con&s;titution or Public-Weal.</P>
<P>His Per&s;on, while he is King or inclu&s;ive of the fir&s;t E&s;tate, is con&s;titutionally &s;acred, and exempted from all Acts of Violence or Con&s;traint. As One of the E&s;tates, al&s;o, he is con&s;tituted a Corporation, and his <HI>Te&s;te-Meip&s;o,</HI> or written Te&s;timony, amounts to a Matter of Record. He al&s;o exerci&s;es, at pre&s;ent, the independent Province of &s;up|plying Members to the &s;econd E&s;tate, by a new Creation; a very large Acce&s;&s;ion to his original Powers. Bi&s;hops al&s;o are now ap|pointed and nominated by the King, another con&s;iderable Addition to the royal Preroga|tive. His is the &s;ole Prerogative to coin or impre&s;s Money, and to &s;pecify, change, or determine the current Value thereof; and for this Purpo&s;e he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have re|&s;erved, from his original Grants of Lands,
<PB N="135" REF="136">a Property in Mines of Gold and Silver, which are therefore called Royalties.</P>
<P>As he is One of the three con&s;titutional E&s;tates, no Action can lie again&s;t him in any Court; neither can he be barred of his Title by length of Time or Entry. And the&s;e Illu&s;trations of his Dignity ca&s;t Rays of an&s;werable Privileges on his royal Con&s;ort, Heir apparent, and elde&s;t Daugh|ter.</P>
<P>The King hath al&s;o &s;ome other inferior and conditional Powers, &s;uch as of in&s;titu|ting Fairs and Markets; and of i&s;&s;uing Pa|tents for &s;pecial or per&s;onal Purpo&s;es, pro|vided they &s;hall not be found to infringe on the Rights of Others. He is al&s;o entru&s;ted with the Guardian&s;hip of the Per&s;ons and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Idiots and Lunatics, without Account.</P>
<P>I leave his Maje&s;ty's Prerogative of a negative Voice in the Legi&s;lature; as al&s;o his Prerogative (or rather Duty) frequently to call the two other E&s;tates to Parliament, and duely to continue, prorogue, and di&s;|&s;olve the &s;ame; till I come to &s;peak of the three E&s;tates, when in &s;uch Parliament a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>Here then, we find that a King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is, con&s;titutionally, inve&s;ted with
<PB N="136" REF="137">every Power that can po&s;&s;ibly be exerted in Acts of Beneficence. And that, while he continues to move within the Sphere of his benign Appointment, he continues to be con&s;tituted the mo&s;t worthy, mo&s;t migh|ty, and mo&s;t glorious Repre&s;entative of Omnipotence upon Earth.</P>
<P>IN treating of the Second and third E|&s;tate, I come naturally to con&s;ider what tho&s;e Re&s;traints are, which, while they are pre&s;erved inviolate, have &s;o happy a Ten|dency to the mutual Pro&s;perity of Prince and People.</P>

<HEAD>The ARISTOCRATICAL; or, SECOND ESTATE.</HEAD>
<P>THE NOBILITY or Second E|&s;tate, in the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is originally Repre&s;entative. The Members were ennobled by <HI>Tenure,</HI> and not by <HI>Writ</HI> or <HI>Patent;</HI> and they were holden in Service, to the Crown and Kingdom, for the re&s;pective Provinces, Counties, or Baronies, who&s;e Name they bore, and which they repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>A Title to be a Member of this Second E&s;tate, was from the Beginning hereditary. The King could not, anciently, either create
<PB N="137" REF="138">or defeat a Title to Nobility. Their Titles were not forfeitable, &s;ave by the Judgment of their Peers upon legal Trial; and when Any were &s;o deprived, or happened to die without Heirs, the Succe&s;&s;ion was deemed too important to be otherwi&s;e filled, than by the Concurrence of the three E&s;tates, by the joint and &s;olemn Act of the PAR|LIAMENT or COMMUNE CONCILIUM REGNI.</P>
<P>The&s;e Truths are atte&s;ted by many an|cient Records and parliamentary Acts. And, although this mo&s;t highly ennobling Cu&s;tom was, at particular Times, infring|ed by particular Tyrants; it was inviola|bly adhered to by the be&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kings, and was ob&s;erved even by the Wor&s;t, excepting a few In&s;tances, till the Reign of <HI>Harry</HI> VII. who wi&s;hed to give Con&s;e|quence to the <HI>third E&s;tate,</HI> by deducting from the Honours and Powers of the <HI>Se|cond.</HI></P>
<P>In Truth, it is not to be wondered that any Kings, who were ambitious of extend|ing their own Power, &s;hould wi&s;h to break and weaken that of the Nobility, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, by &s;o many glo|rious Stands, for Maintenance of Liberty and the Con&s;titution, more particularly during the Reigns of <HI>John, Henry</HI> III. the Second <HI>Edward,</HI> and Second <HI>Richard.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">
Till <HI>Harry</HI> VII. the Nobles were look|ed upon as &s;o many Pillars whereon the People re&s;ted their Rights. Accordingly we find that, in the Coalition or grand Compact between <HI>John</HI> and the collective Body of the Nation, the King and People jointly agree to confide, to the Nobles, the Superintendance of the Execution of the great Charter, with Authority to them, and their Succe&s;&s;ors, to enforce the due Performance of the Covenants therein com|prized.</P>
<P>What an illu&s;trating Di&s;tinction mu&s;t it have been, when Patriot Excellence alone (approved before the Country in the Field or the Council) could give a Claim to No|bility, and compel, as it were, the united E&s;tates of King, Lords, and Commons, to call a Man up to the &s;econd Seat in the Government and Steerage of the Nation.</P>
<P>Such a Preference mu&s;t have proved an unremitting Incitement to the Cultivation and Exerci&s;es of every Virtue; and to &s;uch Exertions, Atchievements, and Acts of public Beneficence, as &s;hould draw a Man forth to &s;o &s;hining a Point of Light, and &s;et him like a Gem in the Gold of the Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
The Crown did not, at once, a&s;&s;ume the independent Right of conferring Nobility. <HI>Henry</HI> III. fir&s;t omitted to call &s;ome of the Barons to Parliament who were per&s;onally obnoxious to him, and he i&s;&s;ued his Writs or written Letters to &s;ome Others who were not Barons, but from whom he expected greater Conformity to arbitrary Mea&s;ures. The&s;e Writs, however, did not enoble the Party till he was admitted, by the &s;econd E&s;tate, to a Seat in Parliament; neither was &s;uch Nobility, by Writ, hereditary.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the&s;e Defects, the arbitrary Mini&s;try of <HI>Richard</HI> II. invented the Me|thod of ennobling by Letters Patent, at the King's Plea&s;ure, whether for Years, or for Life, or in &s;pecial or general Tail, or in Fee-&s;imple to a Man and his Heirs at large. This Prerogative, however, was thereafter, in many In&s;tances, declined and di&s;continued, more particularly by the con|&s;titutional King HARRY the Vth. till meet|ing with no Oppo&s;ition from the other two E&s;tates, it has &s;ucce&s;&s;ively de&s;cended, from <HI>Henry</HI> VII. on nine crowned Heads, through a Pre&s;cription of near a Century and a Half.</P>
<P>Next to their King, the People have al|lowed, to their Peerage, &s;everal Privileges of the mo&s;t uncommon and illu&s;trious Di&s;|tinction,
<PB N="140" REF="141">their Chri&s;tian Names, and the Names that de&s;cended to them from their Ance&s;tors, are ab&s;orbed by the Name from whence they take their Title of Honour, and by This they make their Signature in all Letters and Deeds. Every temporal Peer of the Realm is deemed a Kin&s;man to the Crown. Their Depo&s;ition on their <HI>Honour</HI> is admitted in place of their Oath, &s;ave where they per&s;onally pre&s;ent them|&s;elves as Witne&s;&s;es of Facts; and &s;aving their Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, and Abjuration. Their Per&s;ons are at all times exempted from Arre&s;ts, except in criminal Ca&s;es. A Defamation of their Character is highly puni&s;hable, however true the Facts may be and de&s;erving of Cen&s;ure. During Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, all Actions and Suits at Law again&s;t Peers are &s;u&s;pend|ed. In Pre&s;entments or Indictments by Grand Juries, and on Impeachments by the Hou&s;e of Commons, Peers are to be tried by their Peers alone; for, in all criminal Ca&s;es, they are privileged from the Juri&s;|diction of inferior Courts, excepting on Appeals for Murder or Robbery. Peers are al&s;o exempted from &s;erving on In|que&s;ts. And, in all Civil Cau&s;es, where a Peer is Plaintiff, there mu&s;t be two or more Knights impanneled on the Jury.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops, or &s;piritual Lords, have Privilege of Parliament, but have not the
<PB N="141" REF="142">above Privileges of per&s;onal Nobility. In all criminal Ca&s;es, &s;aving Attainder and Impeachment, they are to be tried by a Pe|tit-Jury. Moreover Bi&s;hops do not vote, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, on the Trial of any Per&s;on for a capital Crime.</P>
<P>All the temporal and &s;piritual Nobles that compo&s;e the Hou&s;e of Lords, however different in their Titles and Degrees of Nobility, are called Peers (Pares) or Equals; becau&s;e their Voices are admitted as of equal Value, and that the Vote of a Bi&s;hop or Baron &s;hall be equivalent to that of an Archbi&s;hop or Duke.</P>
<P>The capital Privilege (or rather Prero|gative) of the Hou&s;e of Peers con&s;i&s;ts in their being <HI>the &s;upreme Court of Judicature,</HI> to whom the final Deci&s;ion of all Civil-Cau&s;es are confided and referred, <HI>in the la&s;t Re&s;ort.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>con&s;titutional Privilege</HI> is a weighty Counterpoi&s;e to his Maje&s;ty's <HI>&s;econd Prero|gative of appointing the Admini&s;trators of Ju&s;tice throughout the Nation;</HI> fora&s;much as Judges (who are immediately under the Influence of the Crown) are yet intimidated from infringing, by any Sentence, on the Laws or Con&s;titution of the&s;e Realms, while a Judgment, &s;o highly &s;uperior to their Own, impends.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143">
The &s;econd great Privilege of the Hou&s;e of Peers con&s;i&s;ts, in their having the Sole Judicature of all Impeachments commenc|ed and pro&s;ecuted by the Commons. And this, again, is a very weighty Counterpoi&s;e to his Maje&s;ty's <HI>third Prerogative of the exe|cutive Government of the&s;e Nations by his Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> &s;ince no Mini&s;ter can be &s;o great, as not ju&s;tly to dread the coming under a Judgment, from which the Mightine&s;s of his royal Ma&s;ter cannot protect him.</P>
<P>The third capital Privilege of the Hou&s;e of Peers &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in their Share, or particu|lar Department of Rights, in the Legi&s;la|ture. This extends to the framing of any Bills, at their Plea&s;ure, for the Purpo&s;es of good Government; &s;aving always to the Commons their incommunicable Right of granting Taxes or Sub&s;idies to be levied on their Con&s;tituents. But, on &s;uch Bills, as on all Others, the Hou&s;e of Lords have a Negative; a happy Counterpoi&s;e to the Power both of King and Commons, &s;hould Demands, on the one Part, or Bounties, on the Other, exceed what is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>The Change of the ancient <HI>Modus,</HI> in conferring Nobility, has not hitherto, as I tru&s;t, been of any con&s;iderable Detriment to the Weal of the People. But, &s;hould

<HEAD>The DEMOCRATICAL; or, THIRD ESTATE.</HEAD>
<P>THE ELECTION of Commoners, to be immediate Tru&s;tees and apt Repre&s;entatives of the People in Parliament, is the hereditary and indefei&s;ible Privilege of the People. It is the Privilege which they accepted and which they retain, in Exchange of their originally inherent and hereditary Right of &s;itting with the King and Peers, IN PERSON, for the Guardian|&s;hip of their own Liberties and the In&s;titu|tion of their own Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">
Such Repre&s;entatives, therefore, can ne|ver have it in their Power to give, delegate, or extingui&s;h the Whole or any Part of the People's in&s;eparable and unextingui&s;hable Share in the legi&s;lative Power, neither to impart the Same to any One of the other E&s;tates, or to any Per&s;ons or Per&s;on what|ever, either in or out of Parliament. Where Plenipotentiaries take upon them to aboli&s;h the Authority of their Principals; or where any &s;econdary Agents attempt to defeat the Power of their Primaries; &s;uch Agents and Plenipotentiaries defeat their own Commi&s;&s;ion, and all the Powers of the Tru&s;t nece&s;&s;arily revert to the Con&s;ti|tuents.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons of the&s;e temporary Tru&s;|tees of the People, during their Se&s;&s;ion, and for fourteen Days before and after eve|ry Meeting, Adjournment, Prorogation, and Di&s;&s;olution of Parliament, are equally exempted, with the Per&s;ons of Peers, from Arre&s;t and Dure&s;s of every Sort.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o, during their Se&s;&s;ion, to have ready Acce&s;s to the King or Hou&s;e of Lords, and to addre&s;s or confer with them on all Occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>They have al&s;o (during Se&s;&s;ion) an equal Power with the Hou&s;e of Lords, to puni&s;h Any who &s;hall pre&s;ume to traduce their Dignity, or detract from the Rights or Privileges of any Member of their Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Commons form a Court of Judica|ture, di&s;tinct from the Judicature of the Hou&s;e of Lords. Theirs is the peculiar Privilege to try and adjudge the Legality of the Election of their own Members. They may fine and confine their own Members, as well as Others, for Delinquency or Offence again&s;t the Honour of their Hou&s;e. But, in all other Matters of Judicature, They are merely a Court of <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;entment,</HI> and not a Tribunal of <HI>difini|tive Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>In this Re&s;pect, however, they are ex|tremely formidable. They con&s;titute the <HI>Grand Inque&s;t</HI> of the Nation; for which great and good Purpo&s;e they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be perfectly qualified by a per&s;onal Knowledge of what hath been tran&s;acted,
<PB N="146" REF="147">throughout the &s;everal Shires, Cities, and Boroughs, from whence they a&s;&s;emble and which they repre&s;ent.</P>

And the&s;e inqui&s;itory and judicial Powers of the two Hou&s;es, from which no Man under the Crown can be exempted, are deemed a &s;ufficient Allay and Counterpoi&s;e to the whole executive Power of the King, by his Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative Department of the Power of the Commons is in all Re&s;pects coequal with that of the Peers. They frame any Bills at Plea&s;ure for the Purpo&s;es of good Government. They exerci&s;e a Right, as the Lords al&s;o do, to propo&s;e and bring in Bills, for the Amendment or Repeal of old Laws, as well as for the Ordaining or In&s;titution of new Ones. And each Hou&s;e,
<PB N="147" REF="148">alike, hath a Negative on all Bills that are framed and pa&s;&s;ed by the Other.</P>
<P>But the capital, the incommunicable, Privilege of the Hou&s;e of Commons, ari&s;es from that holy Tru&s;t which their Con&s;ti|tuents repo&s;e in them; whereby they are impowered to borrow from the People a &s;mall Portion of their Property, in order to re&s;tore it threefold, in the Advantages of Peace, equal Government, and the En|couragement of Trade, Indu&s;try, and the Manufactures.</P>
<P>To impart Any of this Tru&s;t would be a Breach of the Con&s;titution: and even to abu&s;e it would be a felonious Breach of common Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>By this fundamental Tru&s;t and incom|municable Privilege, the Commons have the &s;ole Power over the Money of the Peo|ple; to grant, or deny, Aids, according, as they &s;hall judge them either requi&s;ite, or unnece&s;&s;ary to the Public Service. Theirs is the Province, and theirs alone, to enquire and judge of the &s;everal Occa&s;i|ons for which &s;uch Aids may be required, and to mea&s;ure and appropriate the Sums to their re&s;pective U&s;es. Theirs al&s;o is the &s;ole Province of framing all Bills or Laws for the impo&s;ing of any Taxes, and of ap|pointing the Means for levying the Same
<PB N="148" REF="149">upon the People. Neither may the Fir&s;t or &s;econd E&s;tate, either King or Peerage, propound or do any thing relating to the&s;e Matters, that may any Way interfere with the Proceedings of the Commons; &s;ave in their Negative or A&s;&s;ent to &s;uch Bills, when pre&s;ented to them, without addition, de|duction, or Alteration of any Kind.</P>
<P>After &s;uch-like Aids and Taxes have been levied and di&s;po&s;ed of; the Commons have the further Right of enquiring and examining into the Application of &s;aid Aids; of ordering all Accounts relative thereto to be laid before them; and of cen&s;uring the Abu&s;e or Mi&s;application thereof.</P>
<P>The Royal A&s;&s;ent to all other Bills is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the Terms <HI>(Le Roy le veut) the King wills it.</HI> But, when the Commons pre&s;ent their Bills of Aid, to his Maje&s;ty, it is an&s;wered, <HI>Le Roy remercier Ses loyal Sujects et ain&s;i le veut, the King thanks his loyal Subjects and &s;o willeth.</HI> An expre&s;s Acknowledgment that the Right of grant|ing or levying Moneys, for public Purpo&s;es, lies &s;olely, inherently, and incommunica|bly, in the People and their Repre&s;enta|tives.</P>
<P>This capital Privilege of the Commons con&s;titutes the grand Counterpoi&s;e to the King's principal Prerogative of making

<HEAD>The THREE ESTATES, in PAR|LIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the King, Lords, and Com|mons, in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, the People have depo&s;ited their <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="151">or <HI>ab&s;olute Power,</HI> IN TRUST, for their whole Body; the &s;aid King, Lords, and Com|mons, when &s;o a&s;&s;embled, being the <HI>Great</HI> Repre&s;entative of the whole Nation, as if all the People were then convened in one general A&s;&s;embly</P>
<P>As the In&s;titution, Repeal, and Amend|ment, of Laws, together with the Redre&s;s of public Grievances and Offences, are not within the Capacity of any of the three E&s;tates, di&s;tinct from the Others; the FRE|QUENT HOLDING OF PARLIAMENTS is the vital Food, without which the Con&s;ti|tution cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The three E&s;tates originally, when a&s;|&s;embled in Parliament, &s;at together con&s;ult|ing in the open Field. Accordingly at <HI>Running-Mend,</HI> five hundred Years ago, King <HI>John</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the great Charter (as there|in is expre&s;&s;ed) by the Advice of the Lords &s;piritual and temporal, by the Advice of &s;everal Commoners (by name recited) <HI>et aliorum Fidelium,</HI> and of Others his faithful People. And, in the twenty-fir&s;t Clau&s;e of the &s;aid Charter, he covenants that, <Q>For having the Common Council of the Kingdom to a&s;&s;e&s;s Aids, he will cau&s;e the Lords &s;piritual and temporal to be &s;ummoned by his Writs; and moreover, that he will cau&s;e the principal Com|moners, or Tho&s;e who held from him
<PB N="151" REF="152">in Chief, to be generally &s;ummoned to &s;aid Parliaments by his Sheriffs and Bailiffs.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;aid A&s;&s;emblies however, the Con|cour&s;e became &s;o great and di&s;orderly, and the Conte&s;ts frequently &s;o high between the &s;everal E&s;tates, in A&s;&s;ertion of their re&s;pective Prerogatives and Privileges; that they judged it more expedient to &s;it apart, and &s;eparately to exerci&s;e the Offices of their re&s;pective Departments.</P>
<P>As there is no Man or Set of Men, no Cla&s;s or Corporation, no Village or City, throughout the Kingdom, that is not vir|tually repre&s;ented by their Delegates in Parliament; this <HI>great Body politic</HI> or <HI>Re|pre&s;entative of the Nation</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, like the Body natural, of a Head and &s;everal Mem|bers, which, being endowed with different Powers for the exerci&s;e of different Offices, are yet connected by one main and common Intere&s;t, and actuated by ONE LIFE or SPIRIT OF PUBLIC REASON, called the LAWS.</P>
<P>In all Steps of National Import, the King is to be conducted by the Direction of the Parliament, his great national Council; a Council, on whom it is equally incumbent to con&s;ult for the King with whom they
<PB N="152" REF="153">are connected, and for the People by whom they are delegated, and whom they repre|&s;ent. Thus the King is con&s;titutionally, to be guided by the Sen&s;e of his Parlia|ment; and the Parliament alike is, con|&s;titutionally, to be guided by the general Sen&s;e of the People. The two E&s;tates in Parliament are the Con&s;tituents of the King; and the People, mediately or imme|diately, are the Con&s;tituents of the two E&s;tates in Parliament.</P>
<P>Now, while the three E&s;tates act di&s;|tinctly, within their re&s;pective Depart|ments, they affect and are reciprocally af|fected by Each-Other. This <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Reaction</HI> produces that general and <HI>&s;y&s;tematic Controul</HI> which, like CONSCIENCE, per|vades and &s;uperintends the Whole, check|ing and prohibiting Evil from every Part of the Con&s;titution. And, from this Con|finement of every Part to the Rule of RIGHT REASON, the great LAW OF LI|BERTY TO ALL ari&s;eth.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance. The King has the &s;ole Prerogative of making War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But then the Means are in the Hands of the Peo|ple and their Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Again. To the King is committed the whole executive Power; but then the Mi|ni&s;ters of that Power are accountable to a
<PB N="153" REF="154">Tribunal, from which a Criminal has no Appeal or Deliverance to look for.</P>
<P>Again, to the King is committed the Cognizance of all Cau&s;es. But, &s;hould his Judges or Ju&s;ticiaries pervert the Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, an Inqui&s;ition, Impeach|ment, and Trial impends, from who&s;e Judgment the Judges cannot be exempted.</P>
<P>Again, the King hath a Negative upon all Bills, whereby his own Prerogatives are guarded from Inva&s;ion. But, &s;hould he refu&s;e the royal A&s;&s;ent to Bills tending to the general Good of the Subject, the Com|mons can al&s;o withhold their Bills of A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment, or annex the rejected Bills to their Bill of Aids; and they never failed to pa&s;s in &s;uch agreeable Company.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. To the King is committed the Right of calling the two E&s;tates to Parlia|ment. But, &s;hould he refu&s;e &s;o to call them, &s;uch a Refu&s;al would be deemed <HI>an Abdication of the Con&s;titution;</HI> and no One need to be told, at this Day, that <HI>an Ab|dication of the Con&s;titution</HI> is AN ABDICA|TION OF THE THRONE.</P>
<P>Thus, while the King acts in Con&s;ent with the Parliament and his People, he is limitle&s;s, irre&s;i&s;table, omnipotent upon Earth; He is the free Wielder of all the
<PB N="154" REF="155">Powers of a free and noble People, a King throned over all the Kings of the Children of Men. But, &s;hould he attempt to break Bounds, &s;hould he ca&s;t for Independence; He finds him&s;elf hedged in and &s;traitened on every Side; He finds him&s;elf abandoned by all his Powers, and ju&s;tly left to a State of utter Impotence and Inaction.</P>
<P>Hence is imputed to the &s;overeign Head, in the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the high and divine Attribute, THE KING CAN DO NO WRONG; for he is &s;o circum|&s;cribed from the Po&s;&s;ibility of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that <HI>no Wrong can be permitted to any King in the Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>While the King is thus controuled by the Lords and the Commons; while the Lords are thus controuled by the Commons and the King; and while the Commons are thus controuled, by the other two E&s;tates, from attempting any Thing to the Preju|dice of the general Welfare; the three E&s;tates may be aptly compared to three Pillars, divided below at equidi&s;tant Angles, but united and &s;upported at Top, merely by the Bearing of each Pillar again&s;t the Others. Take but any One of the&s;e Pillars away and the other Two mu&s;t inevitably tumble. But, while All act on Each-Other, All are equally counteracted, and
<PB N="155" REF="156">thereby affirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the general Frame.</P>
<P>How deplorable then would it be, &s;hould this elaborate Structure of our happy Con|&s;titution, within the &s;hort Period of a thou&s;and Years hence, po&s;&s;ibly in Half the time, fall a Prey to Effeminacy, Pu&s;ilani|mity, Venality, and Seduction; like &s;ome ancient Oak, the Lord of the Fore&s;t, to a Pack of vile Worms that lay gnawing at the Root; or, like <HI>Egypt,</HI> be contempti|bly de&s;troyed <HI>by Lice and Locu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Should the Morals of our Con&s;tituents ever come to be debauched; <HI>Con&s;ent,</HI> which is <HI>the Salt of Liberty,</HI> would then be cor|rupted, and no Salt might be found where|with it could be &s;ea&s;oned. Tho&s;e who are inwardly the Servants of <HI>Sin,</HI> mu&s;t be out|wardly the Servants of <HI>Influence.</HI> Each Man would then be as the <HI>Trojan Hor&s;e</HI> of old, and carry the Enemies of his Country within his Bo&s;om. Our own Appetites would then induce us to betray our own Intere&s;ts; and State Policy would &s;eize us by the Hand of our Lu&s;ts, and lead us a <HI>Willing Sacrifice to our own Perdition.</HI></P>
<P>Should it ever come to pa&s;s that Corrup|tion, like a dark and low hung Mi&s;t, &s;hould &s;pread from Man to Man, and cover the&s;e Lands. Should a general Di&s;&s;olution of
<PB N="156" REF="157">Manners prevail. Should Vice be counte|nanced and communicated by the Leaders of Fa&s;hion. Should it come to be propa|gated by Mini&s;ters among Legi&s;lators, and by the Legi&s;lators among their Con&s;titu|ents. Should Guilt lift up its Head with|out fear of Reproach, and avow it&s;elf in the Face of the Sun, and laugh Virtue out of Countenance by Force of Numbers. Should public Duty turn public Strumpet. Should Shops come to be advertized, where Men may di&s;po&s;e of their Honor and Hone&s;ty at &s;o much per Ell. Should public Markets be opened for the purcha&s;e of Con&s;ciences, with an <HI>O yes!</HI> We bid mo&s;t to Tho&s;e who &s;et them&s;elves, their Tru&s;ts, and their Country to Sale! If &s;uch a Day, I &s;ay, &s;hould ever arrive, it will be Dooms-day, indeed, to the Virtue, the Liberty, and Con&s;titution of the&s;e King|doms. It would be the &s;ame to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as it would happen to the Uni|ver&s;e, &s;hould the Laws of Cohe&s;ion cea&s;e to operate, and all the Parts be di&s;&s;ipated who&s;e orderly Connection now forms the Beauty and <HI>Common-Wealth of Nature</HI> &mdash; Want of Sanity in the Materials, can never be &s;upplied by any Art in the Building&mdash;A Con&s;titution of <HI>public Freemen</HI> can never con&s;i&s;t of <HI>private Pro&s;titutes.</HI></P>

WITHIN little more than a Month, <HI>Harry</HI> made him&s;elf perfect Ma&s;ter of the foregoing Sy&s;tem, and wrote Comments upon it much more voluminous than the Text.</P>
<P>As he had lo&s;t his Friend <HI>Ned,</HI> who was now under the Tutelage of his Uncle, Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> little <HI>Dicky Clement</HI> became the principal Companion of his Hours of Amu&s;ement, and <HI>Dicky</HI> with his good will would never be from his Heels.</P>
<P>One Morning, as they &s;trolled up the Road, &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Town, <HI>Harry</HI> ob&s;erved a Crowd gathering fa&s;t on the Way, and ha&s;tened, like Others, to &s;ee what was the Matter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived, he perceived Mr. <HI>Gripe</HI> the Con&s;table at the Head of the Po&s;&s;e, with his painted Staff of Authority exalted in his Hand. Pray, what are you about, Mr. Con&s;table, &s;ays <HI>Harry?</HI> I am going, Sir, to &s;eize a Robber, who has taken Shelter in yonder wa&s;te Hovel &mdash; And who did he rob? &mdash; He robbed Mr. <HI>Niggards</HI> here, that is to &s;ay, his Boy here of a Sixpenny Loaf. Perhaps the Man was hungry, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> and had not wherewithal to buy One. Pray, tell me, my Lad, how the Affair was.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">
Why, Ma&s;ter, you mu&s;t know as how Mr. <HI>Niggards,</HI> my Ma&s;ter here, &s;ent me this Morning to the Town with a Shilling to buy two &s;ixpenny Loaves. So, as I was coming back, I met an able looking Man, who made me afraid with his pale and eager Face. My good Boy, &s;ays he, will you give me one of tho&s;e Loaves in Charity? I dare not, Sir, &s;ays I, they are none of my Own. Here, &s;ays he, I will give you my Hat for One of them; but this I refu&s;ed, as his Hat, to my thinking, was not worth a Groat. Nay, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t have one of the Loaves, that's cer|tain, for I have a Wife and &s;even Children all &s;tarving in yonder Hovel, and, while there's Bread in the World, I can't but &s;natch a Mor&s;el for them. So, as I told you, I was frighted. I gave him One of the Loaves without any more Words, and away he run as fa&s;t as his Legs could carry him; but I followed him with my Eye till I &s;aw him &s;afe lodged.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Harry</HI> wiped his Eye and mu&s;ed awhile. Tell me truely now, my good Boy, continued he, if both tho&s;e Loaves had been your own, would you willingly have given One of them, to keep the poor Man and his Family from peri&s;hing?</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">
I would, Sir, &s;aid the Lad, with a very good Will. And, had I &s;ix Pence of my own, I would have gone back with all my Heart, and have bought another Loaf. But, my Ma&s;ter is a hard Man, and &s;o I was forced to tell him the Truth.</P>
<P>Here, my Lad, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> here is a Crown. Go back, buy two Loaves for your Ma&s;ter, in Place of the One he has lo&s;t, and keep the remaining four Shillings to your&s;elf for your Trouble. You &s;ee, Mr. Con&s;table, continued he, you never can make any thing like Felony of this Matter. The Boy confe&s;&s;es that he gave the Bread with a very good Will, and that he would not have informed, had it not been for fear of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It is very true, plea&s;e your Honour, re|plied Mr. <HI>Gripe,</HI> I my&s;elf do pity the poor Man from my Heart, and will have nothing more to &s;ay in this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Stay awhile, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> perhaps we may find &s;ome further Employment for you. I think I &s;hould know the Face of yonder Man. Is not that the <HI>Niggards</HI> whom you had in Cu&s;tody, the other Day, and for who&s;e Deliverance I paid five and twenty Pounds to his Creditor? The very Man, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Gripe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
<HI>Harry</HI> then put his Hand in his Pocket, and, taking out a &s;mall Scrap of Parch|ment, exclaimed, I am glad of what you tell me with all my Heart! Indeed, I did not like the Looks of the Man at the time, and that made me accept an A&s;&s;ignment of this Action. Here, Mr. <HI>Gripe,</HI> take your Pri&s;oner to fre&s;h Cu&s;tody in my Name. Away with him to Gaol directly! as the holy Go&s;pel has it, <HI>He &s;hall not depart thence till he has paid the uttermo&s;t Farthing.</HI> No, no, Mr. <HI>Niggards,</HI> I will not hear a Word. Go and learn hence forward to be merci|ful your&s;elf, if you would look for any Mercy from God or Man.</P>
<P><HI>Dicky,</HI> my Dear, go back again, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> our Neighbour <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> here will &s;ee you &s;afe home. I will not &s;uffer any One to go in my Company, for fear of putting the poor Man or his Family to &s;hame.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had not advanced fifty Paces to|ward the Hovel, when his Ears were &s;truck with the Sound of &s;udden and joint Lamen|tation; and turning, he perceived that the inqui&s;itive Crowd had gathered at his Heels. My Friends, &s;ays he, I entreat, I be&s;eech you to leave me for the pre&s;ent. I would not choo&s;e any Witne&s;&s;es to what I am a|bout. Pray, oblige me &s;o far as to depart on your own Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
Hereupon, being loth to offend him, they retired a few Steps, and &s;tood toge|ther, aloof, attentive to the Event of this uncommon Adventure.</P>
<P>Mean while the Cry continued with a Bitterne&s;s that thrilled through every Nerve of our Hero; and, as he now approached the Place, he did his utmo&s;t to re&s;train him&s;elf and quell the Feelings within him, and he drew his Hat over his Eyes, to pre|vent the Parties from &s;eeing the Emotion that they cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Hovel was of Mud Walls, without any Roofing; but, as there was an Open|ing where a Door had once been, <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tole to the Entrance, ca&s;ting an under Eye of Ob&s;ervation about him.</P>
<P>Hereupon, a Woman turned. She had been fearfully peering over the Wall at the Crowd which had not yet di&s;per&s;ed, but having Notice of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Entrance, &s;he looked toward him and dropt on her Knees.</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;he cried, if you are the Gentle|man who owned the Loaf, for Chri&s;t his Sake I pray you to have Mercy upon us! Money, indeed, we have not, but we have
<PB N="162" REF="163">the&s;e Shreds remaining, and we will &s;trip our&s;elves of our Covering to make you a Recompen&s;e. Alas, alas, could we have gue&s;&s;ed how my Hu&s;band came by it, we would have fami&s;hed a thou&s;and Times rather than touch a Mor&s;el. But he, dear good Man, did it all for our Sakes, for the Sake of the heavy Burden with which he is overladen. Ah, I would to Heaven we were all dead, hanged or drowned out of his Way. He might then walk the World at large, and be happy, as he de&s;erves.</P>
<P>Here again, &s;he &s;et up her Wailing, which was accompanied by her &s;even Chil|dren, with &s;uch a woful Con&s;ort, as the Heart of <HI>Harry</HI> could not &s;u&s;tain, neither &s;uffer him, for a Sea&s;on, to interrupt or appea&s;e.</P>
<P>At length he &s;aid, with a faultering Voice, pray be not alarmed, Madam. For I di&s;|cern that you are a Gentlewoman, though in a very unhappy Di&s;gui&s;e. The Affair of the Loaf is &s;ettled to your Satisfaction, and here are ten Guineas, it is all that I have about me, and it is only to &s;hew you, for the pre&s;ent, that you are not quite &s;o friendle&s;s in the World as you thought. Meantime I reque&s;t that you will All come with me to <HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> where we will try to do &s;omething better for you.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="164">
Here, the Woman looked with an ear|ne&s;t and eager Rapture at him. May <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;he cried, be your Portion, my Angel; and he is already your Portion, he is &s;een in your Sweet Face, and breaks out at your Eyes in Pity to poor Sinners.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> was now &s;tepping forth, and the Re&s;t prepared to follow him; when the poor Man, who, for Shame, had not yet uttered a Syllable, gently &s;taid him at the Opening. Turn, generous Ma&s;ter, &s;aid he, pray turn and hear a &s;mall Apology for my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. I am a very un|happy Man, I have &s;een better Times; but I am driven, by cruel U&s;age, from Hou&s;e and Home and Maintenance. I was going to <HI>London</HI> to apply to the Law for Relief, when my younge&s;t Child, who was on the Brea&s;t, fell de&s;perately &s;ick about four Days ago. As we had no Money to hire Lodging, and had begged the Means of Life for the two foregoing Days, we were compelled to take up with this &s;helterle&s;s Hovel. From hence I frequented the Road, and for the three la&s;t Day, begged as much as &s;u&s;tained us in coar&s;e Bread and Water. But, this Morning my Boy died, and his Brothers and I, with our Sticks and our Hands, dug his Grave that you &s;ee yonder, and I placed that Flag over him to pre&s;erve his tender Limbs from the
<PB N="164" REF="165">Pigs and the Hounds; till it may plea&s;e Heaven to allow me Means to bury him according to the holy Rites of our Church. This melancholy Office, Sir, detained me &s;o long; and Exerci&s;e had made the Appetites of my Children &s;o outrageous, that I was, in a manner, compelled to do what I did. As I had no Coffin nor wind|ing Sheet, I took the Wai&s;tcoat from my Body and wrapped it about my Babe, and would willingly have wrapped him with my Fle&s;h and my Bones, that we might quiet|ly have lain in one Grave together.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> an&s;wered not a Word, but, walk|ing onward before his Company, plenti|fully watered the Ground with his Tears as he pa&s;&s;ed. While the poor Man took his younge&s;t Son in his Arms, and the Wo|man her younge&s;t Daughter on her Back, and thus, with a lei&s;urely Pace, they all arrived at Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Door being opened, <HI>Harry</HI> led his nine Gue&s;ts to the back Parlour, where he in&s;tantly ordered plenty of Bread and Butter and Milk for the Children, with cold Meat, Ale and Cakes for the Father and Mother; and this was a Matter too cu&s;tomary, in this Hou&s;e, to be any Cau&s;e of Wonder to any Member of the Family.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">
As &s;oon as they were refre&s;hed, he took them all to his Wardrobe, where he con|&s;trained the Parents to take of the very be&s;t Things for them&s;elves and their Children; and having &s;o done, he walked out and left them to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was in his Study, and had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a Letter as <HI>Harry</HI> entered with a &s;miling Countenance. I have been very lucky this Morning, Sir, &s;ays he, I think I have got the prettie&s;t Family of Boys and Girls that is to be found within five Shires. Do you know any thing about them, <HI>Harry?</HI> Nothing further as yet, Sir, than that they and their Parents are ex|ceeding poor, and have fallen, as they &s;ay, into great Misfortunes. The Mother is a very hand&s;ome and genteel young Wo|man, and the Father a portly and very comely Man, &s;ave that he has a large pur|ple Mark on the left Side of his Face. A purple Mark! cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> and &s;tart|ed. Go, my Dear, and bring that Man to me directly. Why pray Sir, do you know him? No, my Love, I &s;hould not know him tho' he &s;tood before me, but I would give a thou&s;and Pound that he may prove the Man I mean, and that I &s;hall di&s;co|ver on a &s;hort Examination.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
By this Time, the Father of our new Family was dre&s;&s;ed, and <HI>Harry</HI> took him by the Hand, bid him be of good Courage, and led him in to his Uncle. He bowed twice with an awful and timid Re&s;pect; while Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> ro&s;e and looked earne&s;tly at him. I rejoice, Sir, &s;ays he, to find that my Son, here, has been of &s;ome lit|tle Matter of u&s;e to you and your Family. Pray take a Seat, nearer to me, Sir, if you plea&s;e. He tells me you have met Mi&s;|fortunes, I al&s;o have had my Share. I think my&s;elf nearly of Kin to the Unhappy; and you will &s;ingularly oblige me by as much of your Story as you &s;hall plea&s;e to com|municate. I am intere&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>I have nothing to conceal from your Honour, an&s;wered the Stranger. And I &s;hall willingly give you an open and faithful Narrative of my &s;hort but &s;ad Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>My Name is <HI>Giffard Homely.</HI> My Fa|ther was a Farmer in ea&s;y Circum&s;tances near <HI>Stratford.</HI> He bound me Apprentice to a Tanner; and when my Time was out, gave a hundred and twenty Pieces to &s;et me up in my Bu&s;ine&s;s. But, dying &s;oon after, he bequeathed the Bulk of his Sub|&s;tance to my elder Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="168">
Though my Brother was a Spendthrift, I loved him dearly; and, when his Credi|tors fell upon him, I became his Bail for two hundred Pounds. Within a few Months after, he &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, and I never could learn further Tidings concerning him.</P>
<P>A Writ was thereupon marked again&s;t me, and put into the Hands of Bailiffs. But Liberty was precious. I left all my Sub&s;tance to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Pur&s;uers, and, pa&s;&s;ing at a great Rate, I e&s;caped in|to <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>There I joined my&s;elf to <HI>Anthony Granger</HI> the Tanner. Independent of his Trade, he held a very beautiful and well parked Farm, under Sir <HI>Spranger Thornhill,</HI> the Lord of the Mannor. And, as I &s;erved him with great Zeal, Affection, and Appli|cation, his Affairs pro&s;pered mainly under my Hands.</P>
<P>He had an only Child, a very lovely Girl of about ten Years of Age, her Manners, like her Countenance, were extremely en|gaging; and I took va&s;t Delight, at all lei|&s;ure Hours, in teaching her to read and write, and in diverting her with a Variety of little Plays and Amu&s;ements.</P>

I had no Intention, at that Time, of gaining her young Heart; but that hap|pened to prove the mi&s;erable Con&s;equence; and a heavy Price it is that my poor dear Girl has &s;ince pay'd for her Affection.</P>
<P>Year after Year, &s;he now grew in Sta|ture, but much more in Loveline&s;s, at lea&s;t in my Eyes. And yet I flattered my&s;elf that I affected her merely for her own &s;ake. I u&s;ed to plea&s;e my&s;elf with the Pro&s;pect of her being advanced to high Fortune; and I thought that I would willingly have given her up at the Altar to &s;ome Lord of the Land.</P>
<P>One Hollantide Eve, a Parcel of young Folk, of us, were diverting our&s;elves about the Fire with &s;everal Pa&s;times; and, a|mong the re&s;t, the Play was introduced of, <HI>I love my Love with an</HI> A <HI>becau&s;e She's amia|ble,</HI> and &s;o on through the Alphabet.</P>
<P>When it came to my <HI>Peggy</HI>'s Turn, &s;he &s;aid, I love my Love with an H, be|cau&s;e he's very <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> and I never will hate him for his being <HI>Homely.</HI> And this might have pa&s;&s;ed without any Ob&s;ervation, had &s;he not ca&s;t a Glance at me and blu&s;hed ex|ceedingly, which threw me al&s;o into equal Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">
As this was the fir&s;t Di&s;covery that I made of her Affection, it al&s;o &s;erved to open my Eyes to the Strength of my own Pa&s;&s;ion; and this co&s;t me many a &s;leeple&s;s Night and aching Heart. I did not look upon my&s;elf as a &s;ufficient Match for her; I reflected that it would be very ungenerous to le&s;&s;en the Fortune or Happine&s;s of the Girl that I loved; and I re&s;olved a hundred times to quit the Country, that my Ab&s;ence might cure both her and my&s;elf of our fooli&s;h Fondne&s;s for Each-Other. But, though this was what my Rea&s;on &s;till prompted and approved; my Heart &s;till held me back, as it were for a while longer, when I was on the Brink of De|parture.</P>
<P><HI>Peggy</HI> was ju&s;t arrived to her fifteenth Year, on the 24th of <HI>April,</HI> and was elect|ed by the Neighbours to be Queen of the following <HI>May,</HI> and to deliver the Prizes to the Victors at the Wake.</P>
<P>I had made a Vow, within my&s;elf, to for&s;ake her and the Country, the very Day after her Regency. But, in the mean while, I could not re&s;i&s;t the Temptation of &s;hewing my Addre&s;s before the Queen of my Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171">
Accordingly, on the Day, I entered the Li&s;ts among the other young Candidates. But, I will not burden your Honour with a particular Detail of our in&s;ignificant Con|te&s;ts. You have unque&s;tionably been Witne&s;s to the like on &s;everal Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>It will be &s;ufficient to inform You, that as I had the Fortune to get the better at the Race, and at Wre&s;tling; when I &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively went to receive the re&s;pective Prizes, my <HI>Peggy</HI>'s Eyes danced, and her Feet went pit-a-pat with Joy as I approached her.</P>
<P>Cudgels came next in play, and a little Stage of Boards was erected for the Pur|po&s;e, that the Spectators might &s;ee with the better Advantage. I had long learned this Art from a famous Ma&s;ter in <HI>Stratford;</HI> and, as I was confident of my Superiority, I hurt my Rivals as little as po&s;&s;ible; only ju&s;t &s;ufficient to make them acknowledge that they were foiled.</P>
<P>At length, one <HI>Hector Pluck,</HI> a Butcher, mounted the Stage. He had, it &s;eems, been quite an Adept at this Sport, and, for ten foregoing Years, had carried off the Prize from &s;everal neighbouring Shires; but he was now come to &s;ettle near <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and was to have been married, the follow|ing
<PB N="171" REF="172">Day, to a Farmer's Daughter who was One of the fair Spectators at the Wake.</P>
<P>The Moment he a&s;&s;ailed me, I perceiv|ed that his Pa&s;&s;ions were up, and that his Eye was a plain Interpreter of the Deadli|ne&s;s of his Heart. He fought cautiou&s;ly however, and kept on a watchful Re&s;erve; and we had long attacked and defended, without any Advantage on either Part; when, with a Motion and Fury quick as Lightning, he made a &s;ide Stroke at me, and aimed to cut me acro&s;s the Face with the Point of his Stick. This was a Blow which I had not Time to intercept or even to &s;ee. The Villain however happily mi&s;&s;ed of his Intention; for his Cudgel, be|ing &s;omething advanced, only brui&s;ed my right Cheek; when in&s;tantly I gave him an exa&s;perated Stroke on the Head, and, cutting him to the Skull, laid him &s;prawl|ing on the Stage; whereat All who knew me gave a great Shout.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time he ro&s;e, and advancing a little toward me, he &s;tretched out his left Hand, as if in Token of Reconciliation; while, pulling out his Butcher's Knife, from a Sheath in his Side-pocket, he, with his right Hand, made a Stab at my Heart, and &s;uddenly leaping off the Stage, at|tempted to e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">
Immediately the Blood poured from me, in a Stream, and ran along the Boards. I found my&s;elf growing weak, and, &s;itting down on the Stage, I had the Pre&s;ence of Mind to rip open my Bo&s;om, and taking out my Handkerchief, I held it to the Wound.</P>
<P>In the mean time the whole Concour&s;e was in an uproar. The Cry went about that <HI>Giffard Homely</HI> was murdered, <HI>Giffard Homely</HI> was killed. My poor dear <HI>Peggy</HI> fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s from her Throne, and was car|ried home in the Fit. Several Hor&s;emen ha&s;ted away, of their own accord, for a Surgeon. And the Butcher was pur&s;ued, knocked down, hard pinioned, and con|veyed with following Cur&s;es to the Gaol of <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>Among Others who came to condole with me, little Ma&s;ter <HI>Billy Thornhill,</HI> our Landlord's Son and Heir, came running, and de&s;ired to be lifted up on the Stage.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he &s;aw the Blood, and how weak and pale I looked, he broke out in|to a pa&s;&s;ionate Fit of Tears. O <HI>Giffard,</HI> my <HI>Giffard,</HI> my poor <HI>Giffard,</HI> be cried, I fear you are a dead Man! You will no more be my Holiday Companion, <HI>Giffard.</HI> Ne|ver more will you go a Birding with me;
<PB N="173" REF="174">or &s;et Gins for the Rabbits, or catch little Fi&s;hes for me; or carry me on your Back through the Water, or in your Arms over the Mire. Alack, alack, what &s;hall I do, if I lo&s;e you, my poor <HI>Giffard!</HI></P>
<P>The Surgeon came at full Gallop. As &s;oon as he had &s;een the Greatne&s;s of the Ga&s;h, &s;ay your la&s;t Prayer, my Friend, he cried; in a very few Minutes you mu&s;t be a dead Man. But, when he had probed the Wound, his Face turned to Chearful|ne&s;s. A mo&s;t wonderful E&s;cape, he cried; the Weapon has mi&s;&s;ed your Vitals, and only glanced along the Rib. Be of good Courage; I engage, in a few Weeks, to &s;et you once more upon your Legs.</P>
<P>Mean time, my loving Neighbours made a Litter and Bed for me of the Tents and Tent-Poles, All &s;triving who &s;hould carry me, and All e&s;corting me home.</P>
<P>The good Mr. <HI>Granger</HI> had been that Day confined by a Sprain in his Ancle, and now &s;at weeping by his Child, who fell out of one fainting Fit into Another, till &s;he was told that I was brought home, and that the Doctor had pronounced me out of Danger.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was put to Bed, and my kind Attendants withdrawn, Mr. <HI>Granger,</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="175">on a Crutch, came limping and &s;at down by me. He had endeavoured to re&s;train his Tears before the Crowd, but as &s;oon as he was &s;eated they broke out anew.</P>
<P>O <HI>Giffard, Giffard,</HI> he cried; my dear <HI>Peggy</HI> is very ill, and You are very ill, and to lo&s;e you both at once would be hard upon me indeed!</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding a &s;hort Fever, the Doctor happened to keep his Promi&s;e, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Youth and a good Habit; and I began to gather Strength and reco|ver apace.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was up and about, I ob|&s;erved that Mi&s;s <HI>Peggy</HI> &s;eemed no longer de&s;irous of re&s;training her kind Looks or her kind Offices; and this gave me &s;ome Concern, till I al&s;o ob&s;erved that her Fa|ther took no Unbrage, or no Notice of it.</P>
<P>One Evening, as we &s;at over a Tankard of October, <HI>Giffard,</HI> &s;ays he, bluntly, what would you think of my <HI>Peggy</HI> for a Wife? Nothing at all, Sir, &s;ays I. I would not marry your Daughter, if &s;he would have me to-morrow. Pray why &s;o, <HI>Giffard? Peggy</HI> is very pretty, and de&s;erving, as I think, of as good a Man as you. Her De|&s;ervings, Sir, &s;aid I, are my very Objection; I &s;carce know a Man in the Land who is
<PB N="175" REF="176">de&s;erving of her. If that is the Ca&s;e, <HI>Giffard,</HI> her Hand is at your Service with all my Heart. O, Sir, I replied, I have no &s;uitable Fortune; but I know you are plea&s;ed to banter; I am no Match for her. You are an indu&s;trious and a making young Man, &s;aid he; and &s;uch a One is richer, in my Eye, than a Spender with Thou|&s;ands. Be&s;ide, you are loving and good|natured, my Son, and I &s;hall not lo&s;e my Child by you, but gain another Child in you, as dear to me as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here, I was &s;o tran&s;ported, &s;o over|powered by the Kindne&s;s of the dear good Man, that I could not get out a Syllable; but, &s;inking before him, I eagerly gra&s;ped his Legs, and then his Knees, and, ri&s;ing, went out to vent my Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In about a Month after, Sir <HI>Spranger Thornhill</HI> and my young Friend, Ma&s;ter <HI>William,</HI> honoured our Nuptials with their Pre&s;ence; and all our kind Neighbours came crowding to the Solemnity, and, by their Joy, appeared to be Parties in our Union.</P>
<P>For eight following Years, never was known a happier Family. But, about that time, Sir <HI>Spranger Thornhill</HI> &s;icken'd and died; and was attended to the dark Man|&s;ion
<PB N="176" REF="177">of the Bodies of his Ance&s;tors, by the greate&s;t Concour&s;e of true Mourners that ever was &s;een in the Shire, All lamenting that Goodne&s;s was not exempted from Mortality.</P>
<P>Our dear Father could never be &s;aid to hold up his Head, from that Day. He &s;i|lently pined after his old Friend, and Patron, Sir <HI>Spranger;</HI> and all our Cares and Care&s;&s;es were not able to withhold him from follow|ing the &s;ame appointed Track.</P>
<P>Never, &s;ure, was Grief like mine and my <HI>Peggy</HI>'s. In looking at each Other we &s;aw the Lo&s;s that we had &s;u&s;tained; and, while we lay Arm in Arm, often, often have we watered the good Man's Memory with our Tears.</P>
<P>Time, however, who has many &s;evere Sorrows in Pro&s;pect, helps to &s;often and le&s;&s;en tho&s;e that he brings in his Train. An encrea&s;ing Family of Children, &s;weetly tempered like their Mother, called for all my Concern; and our young Landlord, Sir <HI>William,</HI> whenever he came from College, u&s;ed to make our Hou&s;e his Home, and take me with him wherever he went; till Lord <HI>Lechmore,</HI> his Guardian, took him from the Univer&s;ity, and &s;ent him abroad, with a Tutor and Servants, on his Tra|vels.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">
As I had made con&s;iderable Savings, and now looked to have a Number of Children to provide for, I re&s;olved to realize all that I could for the poor Things: So I built a Malt-Hou&s;e, and Wind-mill, and planted a large Orchard, with other profitable Im|provements, that co&s;t me to the Amount of about eight hundred Pounds.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Things were in Agitation, Sir <HI>Free&s;tone Hardgrave,</HI> one of the Knights for our Shire, came into that Part of the Country. He had lately purcha&s;ed a fine E&s;tate, adjoining to the We&s;t-&s;ide of my Concern; and was a Man of va&s;t Opulence, but a Stranger among us, at that time.</P>
<P>Though Sir <HI>Free&s;tone</HI> was an old Bache|lor, and had one of the mo&s;t remor&s;ele&s;s Hearts that ever informed the Shape of Man, he had yet a plea&s;ing A&s;pect and in|&s;inuating Addre&s;s, and always applied tho&s;e Qualities to the Purpo&s;e of Betraying. Alas! I was informed, but too late, of his Character; that his Avarice outgrew even the Growth of his Wealth; and that his De&s;ires encrea&s;ed in exact Proportion, as Age happened to deduct from his Ability to gratify them.</P>
<P>Unhappily, he ca&s;t a greedy Eye at my little Farm. Like another lordly <HI>Ahab</HI> he
<PB N="178" REF="179">coveted the Vineyard of poor <HI>Naboth;</HI> and, at length, compa&s;&s;ed his Ends by Means equally iniquitous.</P>
<P>When he propo&s;ed to give me more than Value for it, I an&s;wered, that I my&s;elf had taken a Fancy to it, for the &s;ake of the dear Man who had given it to me, in Tru&s;t for his Child and her Po&s;terity; and that I would not part with it for twenty Times an Equivalent. With this, however, he did not appear in the lea&s;t di&s;concerted; but &s;aid that he e&s;teemed and affected me the more for my Gratitude to the Memory of my old Benefactor.</P>
<P>I was afterwards told, and learned by dear Experience, that he never pardoned an Offence, nor even a Di&s;appointment; but nothing of this Di&s;po&s;ition appeared for the pre&s;ent. He vi&s;ited, made it his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to meet me in &s;everal Places; &s;ought and &s;eemed quite de&s;irous of cultivating an Acquaintance with me; did me many lit|tle friendly Offices among my richer Neigh|bours; conde&s;cended to toy with my Little Ones; appeared to take a huge Liking to my two elde&s;t Boys; &s;tood Godfather to my little Girl that is now in her Mother's Arms; &s;aid he wondered how I contrived it to maintain &s;o numerous a Family upon &s;uch &s;lender Means; and promi&s;ed to pro|cure
<PB N="179" REF="180">me a beneficial Po&s;t in the Collection of the Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>After a Cour&s;e of &s;uch &s;pecious Kindne&s;&s;es, and while my Heart glowed with Grati|tude, in the Recollection of his Favours both pa&s;t and propo&s;ed; he came to my Hou&s;e in a mighty Hurry. My dear <HI>Homely,</HI> &s;ays he, I have ju&s;t &s;truck up a mo&s;t advantageous Bargain with our Neigh|bour Squire <HI>Spendal.</HI> But he wants the Money immediately. I have not the Whole about me; and yet if I don't pay him down directly, &s;ome cur&s;ed Di&s;appoint|ment may intervene. Do, run and bring me all that you have, quickly! I will re|pay you within two or three Days at fur|the&s;t.</P>
<P>Here I ha&s;ted, with Joy, to the Corner where I had depo&s;ited my Ca&s;h, as well for Payment of Rent as another little Mat|ter that I had in my Eye; and, bringing out a leathern Bag, I lay'd it on the Table. There, Sir, &s;aid I, are two hundred and thirty Guineas; take but the Trouble to count them out, and give me a &s;hort Ac|knowledgment. No, &s;aid he, my dear <HI>Homely,</HI> never heed it for the pre&s;ent, I will be back with you the Moment I have paid the Purcha&s;e; and &s;o &s;aying, he caught up the Bag, and huddled away as fa&s;t as his old Legs could &s;camper; while I &s;at &s;till,
<PB N="180" REF="181">through A&s;toni&s;hment, my Heart mi&s;giv|ing me, at the Time, as if it foreboded the Mi&s;chiefs that were to follow.</P>
<P>I waited, with great Anxiety, for his Re|turn till Evening, when ha&s;tening to his Lodge, I was there informed that he had &s;et out for <HI>London</HI> five Hours before. This threw me into a Pannick, though not alto|gether without a Mixture of Hope, and &s;o I waited till the three Days of his Promi&s;e &s;hould expire. Mr. <HI>Snack</HI> then came to me and demanded the Rent. He was a <HI>Lincoln</HI> Attorney, whom Lord <HI>Lechmore</HI> had lately preferred to the Care of my Landlord's Concerns, upon the Death of Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> the good old Agent. I told him ingenuou&s;ly how Matters had happen|ed, and &s;aid I would hurry to <HI>London,</HI> and bring back the Money directly.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I po&s;ted away, and re&s;ted not till I arrived at the great City. There, for &s;even Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, I be&s;ieged the Doors of Sir <HI>Free&s;tone,</HI> hourly knocking and reque&s;ting to be admitted to his Pre&s;ence. But he was either not up, or ju&s;t gone out, or had Company with him, or was ju&s;t then very bu&s;y and not to be &s;poken to, and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>At length, when he found that I would not quit his Hou&s;e without an An&s;wer, he
<PB N="181" REF="182">ordered me before him. His Chariot wait|ed at the Gate, and he &s;tood dre&s;&s;ed in the Hall. As I approached, and bowed with the Re&s;pect and mortified Air of a Petitio|ner, he put on a Look of the mo&s;t &s;trange and audacious Effrontery I ever beheld. Who are you, Friend, &s;aid he, and what may your Bu&s;ine&s;s be with me? I am come, an' it plea&s;e your Honour, humbly to tell you that I am called upon for my Rent, and to be&s;eech your Honour to re&s;tore me the two hundred and thirty Pieces you had from me the other Day. Here, &s;ays he to his Servants, this mu&s;t be &s;ome De&s;perado who is come to rob me in broad Day, and in the Middle of my own People; the Fel|low &s;ays I owe him Money, I know not that I ever &s;aw his Face before; I de&s;ire that you will not &s;uffer &s;uch a dangerous Villain to enter my Doors any more. And, &s;o &s;aying, out he &s;tepped, and away he drove.</P>
<P>O Sir, how I was &s;truck to the Heart at that In&s;tant! I &s;naked out, &s;carce half a|live; not remembering where I was, or whither I was to go. Alas, I was far from making the Speed back again that I had done in going. I knew not how to &s;hew my Face to my <HI>Peggy</HI> or her dear Little Ones, whom I had plundered and &s;tript of their Sub&s;tance by &s;tupidly &s;urrendering it,
<PB N="182" REF="183">without Witne&s;&s;es or a &s;ingle Line where|by I might reclaim it. At length I got Home, if Home it might be called, that had, then, Nothing in it, or at lea&s;t No|thing for me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Snack</HI> had taken the Advantage of my Ab&s;ence to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of my Farm and of All that I was worth. Under co|lour of di&s;training for Rent, he had &s;eized every thing, even the Beds whereon my Wife and Children lay, with all their wearing Apparel, &s;ave what they had on their Backs. The Bill of Apprai&s;ement, which I have here, comes to upward of &s;ix hundred Pounds. But, when the Cattle and other Effects were &s;et up to Sale, the Auctionier and Bidders proved of Mr. <HI>Snack</HI>'s providing; All were intimidated from offering any thing, &s;ave Tho&s;e who offered in Tru&s;t for this Charitable Agent. And the Whole of my Sub&s;tance went off within the Value of one Year's Rent, being one hundred and eighty five Pounds.</P>
<P>Never, exclaimed Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> never did I hear of &s;o barefaced and daring a Violation of all Laws divine and human, and that too under Sanction of the mo&s;t perfect Sy&s;tem of Law that ever was fram|ed. But, what will not Power effect, when unre&s;trained of Con&s;cience, when prompted by Avarice, and abetted by Cun|ning!
<PB N="183" REF="184">And, is there no Remedy, Sir, cried out our Hero? None that I know of, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ave where Power oppo&s;es Power in Favour of Weakne&s;s, or Wealth oppo&s;es Wealth in Favour of Poverty. But we will &s;ee what may be done. Mean while, let Mr. <HI>Homely</HI> proceed in his Nar|rative.</P>
<P>When my Family, continued <HI>Homely,</HI> were thus turned out of Doors. An old Follower made way for them in his own Cottage, and retired with his Wife and Daughter to a Cow-hou&s;e hard by. Mean while my loving Neighbours &s;upplied them with &s;ufficient Bedding, and daily kept them in Victuals, even more than they could eat.</P>
<P>While I went &s;lowly to &s;ee them, &s;top|ping, and turning every Minute toward our old Habitation; all the Horrors of our Situation flew upbraidingly in my Face: And I accu&s;ed my&s;elf as the Robber and Murderer of eight Per&s;ons, for any One of whom I would have &s;pent my Life.</P>
<P>When I &s;tooped to enter their lowly Roof, all trembling and &s;ick at Heart, I expected to meet nothing but Faces of Aver&s;ion and Expre&s;&s;ions of Reproach. But, when they all &s;et up a Shout of Joy at my Appearance; when they All crowded
<PB N="184" REF="185">cla&s;ping and clinging about me; the Vio|lence and Di&s;traction of my inward Emo|tion deprived me of Sen&s;ation, and I &s;wooned away.</P>
<P>When I revived, I ca&s;t a Look about me, and perceived that their Grief had been as extreme, as their Joy was at my Arrival. Ah, my <HI>Peggy,</HI> I cried, how have I undone You! By you, I got all my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and, in Return, I have deprived You of All that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. You were every Ble&s;&s;ing to me, and I have repaid you with nothing but Mi&s;ery and Ruin.</P>
<P>Don't be concerned, My Love, &s;ays &s;he; neither repine at the Con&s;equences of your own Goodne&s;s and Hone&s;ty. You are not as God to &s;ee into all Hearts; the Wi&s;e&s;t may be deceived; and the Be&s;t, as I believe, are the mo&s;t &s;ubject to be impo&s;ed upon. Common Charity mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed that there could not be &s;uch a Soul as Sir <HI>Free|&s;tone</HI> upon Earth. But be of good Courage, my Hu&s;band, I have good News for you. I dreamed that our dear Father appeared to me la&s;t Night. Don't be di&s;heartened, my Child, &s;ays he; bear the Cro&s;s that is laid upon. You, with a chearful and free Will, and All &s;hall be re&s;tored to You &s;e|ven fold upon Earth, and &s;eventy &s;even fold in the Life that has no ending.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">
When I found that my <HI>Peggy,</HI> in&s;tead of Di&s;ta&s;te and Upbraiding, had nothing but Love in her Looks and Con&s;olation in her Expre&s;&s;ions; I folded her to my Bo|&s;om, and to my Soul that went to meet her, and I would willingly have made her One with my own Being.</P>
<P>My Neighbours were not as Birds of the Sea&s;on. They neither de&s;pi&s;ed nor for&s;ook me becau&s;e of my Poverty. They came crowding to condole with me. They advi&s;ed me to apply to the Law again&s;t Sir <HI>Free&s;tone</HI> and Attorney <HI>Snack;</HI> and they offered to contribute towards my Journey. They al&s;o joined in this written Te&s;timony of my Character and pro&s;perous Circum|&s;tances, before <HI>Snack</HI> made his Seizure. And Two of them have witne&s;&s;ed in this bit of Paper that, when the Alarm came of Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI>'s Death, and of a &s;trange Agent's being put in his room, they heard my &s;ay that I did not matter the wor&s;t he could do; and &s;aw me count down twenty Pieces over and above my Year's Rent.</P>
<P>The late Frights and Fatigues which <HI>Peggy</HI> underwent during <HI>Snack</HI>'s Operati|ons; together with her Extremes of Joy on my Return, and of Grief at the Fit into which I had fallen, ha&s;tened on her Labour; and She was delivered, before her Time, of
<PB N="186" REF="187">that weakly little Babe whom I buried this Morning.</P>
<P>Within &s;ix Weeks after her Child-Birth, we prepared for our Journey. Our Neigh|bours, like the good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> had Com|pa&s;&s;ion upon him who fell among the Thieves. They made me up a Pur&s;e of thirty and five Pounds, and promi&s;ed to contribute further toward the carrying on of my Suit.</P>
<P>We travelled happily by ea&s;y Journeys of a few Miles a Day, till, nine Days ago, we reached a &s;mall Village the other Side of <HI>St. Albans.</HI> There we took up our Re&s;t, for the Night, at a Hou&s;e that had no Sign, but &s;et occa&s;ional Lodgings and &s;old. Bread and &s;mall Drink.</P>
<P>As I de&s;ired a &s;eparate Apartment for our&s;elves, we were put into a kind of wa&s;te Room, that had no Fa&s;tening to the Door except a Latch. After a &s;lender Supper, we lay down on our Floor Beds, and I &s;tuff|ed my Breeches clo&s;e under my Head with all po&s;&s;ible Caution. We had made an ex|traordinary Journey that Day, and I was particularly fatigued by carrying &s;everal of my tired Children &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in my Arms; &s;o that we All &s;lept but too &s;oundly, and when I awoke in the Morning, neither Money nor Breeches were to be found.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">
Such a Lo&s;s, at another time, would have been as nothing to me. But, in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, it was a Repetition and Doubling of All that we had lo&s;t be|fore. I in&s;tantly &s;ummoned the People of the Hou&s;e, and, in a good deal of Warmth, charged our Landlord with the Felony, telling him that I had been robbed of above three and thirty Pounds. Why, Ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, I know of nothing to the contrary, but it would be very hard, indeed, if I was to be an&s;werable for the Hone&s;ty of every One who goes this Road. If you had gi|ven your Money in charge to me, I would have been accountable for it. I believe, by the Grief You are in, that You mu&s;t have been Lo&s;ers; I will therefore forgive you your Reckoning, and give you a Pair of Breeches of my own into the Bargain; but this is all I will do, till the Law forces me.</P>
<P>As there was no Remedy, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, I accepted his Overture and &s;et out. But, O Sir, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Horrors of my Soul, as I &s;ilently &s;tepped along, ca&s;ting an Eye of mingled Pity and De&s;pair upon my Chil|dren. I cur&s;ed in &s;ecret my own Exi&s;tence, and wi&s;hed for &s;ome &s;udden Thunderbolt to cru&s;h me into Nothing. All Tru&s;t in God or his Providence had now wholly for|&s;aken me, and I looked upon him as ne|glecting
<PB N="188" REF="189">all other Objects of his Wrath, and exerting his Omnipotence again&s;t me and Mine alone.</P>
<P><HI>Peggy,</HI> as I &s;uppo&s;e, perceived how it was with me, and kept behind awhile, that &s;he might give way to the pre&s;ent Tumult and Di&s;temper of my Mind. At length, hoping to admini&s;ter &s;ome Matter of Com|fort to me, &s;he came up and &s;ilently put a few Shillings into my Hand, &s;aying, Cou|rage, my dear Hu&s;band, All cannot be lo&s;t while we have a God who is infinitely rich to depend upon. Ay, &s;aid I, the&s;e are the Fruits of your Dreams, the&s;e are Your promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings that Heaven had in Store for us. And &s;till has in Store, &s;he replied; the &s;ame Hand that holds the Rod holds the comforting Staff al&s;o. Tell me not of Comfort, I cried, I &s;ee that the Face of God is &s;et in Blackne&s;s and Bla&s;ting again&s;t me. But, for me it matters not, had he not taken me at an Advantage. He &s;ees that I have eight Lives, All dearer than my Own, and he is determined to kill me in every One of them.</P>
<P>Do not ca&s;t from you, my Love, &s;he &s;aid, the only Crutch that the World and the Wretched have to re&s;t upon. God is plea&s;ed, perhaps, to take all human Means from us, that he may &s;hew forth the Won|ders of his Power in our Relief. While
<PB N="189" REF="190">any other Hope is left, we are apt to tru&s;t to that Hope, and we look not toward the &s;ecret Hand by which we are fed and &s;up|ported; but, when All is lo&s;t, All gone, when no other Stay is left, &s;hould &s;udden Mercy come upon us, our Comforter then becomes vi&s;ible, He &s;tands revealed in his Greatne&s;s and Glory before us, and we are compelled to cry out, with <HI>unbelieving Thomas,</HI> My Lord, and my God!</P>
<P>Though the&s;e pious Expo&s;tulations of my dearly beloved Preacher had little In|fluence, at the time, for appea&s;ing my own Pa&s;&s;ions, I was yet plea&s;ed that my <HI>Peggy</HI> had her &s;ecret Con&s;olations, but little ima|gined that her Prophecy approached &s;o near to its Completion.</P>
<P>For two Days we held on, living on &s;uch Bread and Milk, as we could purcha&s;e at the Cabbins that had the Charity to receive us. But my Boy, who was on the Brea&s;t, grew exceeding &s;ick; &s;o we were obliged to &s;horten our Journeys, for the two &s;uc|ceeding Days, partly begging and partly paying for &s;uch Victuals as we could pro|cure. Toward Evening we came within Sight of this Town. Our little Money was quite exhau&s;ted, and our Child grown too ill to bear further Travel. So, I looked about, and perceived &s;ome roofle&s;s Walls that &s;tood off from the Highway, and
<PB N="190" REF="191">thither we turned and took up our bleak Abode.</P>
<P>For the three following Days I frequented the Road, and by begging procured what &s;cantily kept my Family from peri&s;hing. Mean time, my Spirit was tamed and &s;ub|dued by the Habit of Mortification; and I looked up to Heaven and cried, Pardon, Pardon, O my God, the Offences and Bla&s;phemies of my Murmurings again&s;t You! You formerly ble&s;&s;ed me with an over Abundance of Ble&s;&s;ings, and that too for a long Sea&s;on; and, as <HI>Job</HI> ju&s;tly &s;ays, &s;hall we receive Good at the Hand of God and not receive Evil?&mdash;O Friend, and Saviour of Sinners! if thou love&s;t whom thou cha&s;tene&s;t, and receive&s;t Tho&s;e whom thou do&s;t &s;courge; when Death &s;hall have put a Period to the Sufferings of Mortality; may I not humbly look to find Grace at the Foot&s;tool of the Throne of thy Mercy-Seat?</P>
<P>At length our Child died this Morning, and we buried him in our Hovel, and watered his Grave with the Tears that we &s;hed for him and for Each-Other. The re&s;t, Sir, you know, till this Angel of God was &s;ent, to accompli&s;h the Prediction of my <HI>Peggy</HI> in all its Fulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192">
Here <HI>Homely</HI> concluded; and, after a Pau&s;e and a deep Sigh, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> de|manded, Have you told me the Whole of your Hi&s;tory, Mr. <HI>Homely?</HI> I have, &s;o plea&s;e your Honour, through every Parti|cular of any Signification.&mdash;I am &s;orry for it. Pray think again. Did you never meet with any Adventure that is yet un|recited? did you never &s;ave any Per&s;on at your own Peril?&mdash;No, Sir&mdash;O, now I recollect.</P>
<P>Some two or three and twenty Years ago, as I fled from the Bailiffs who pur&s;ued me, as I told you, for the Bail of my Bro|ther, I came to the River <HI>Avon.</HI> The Flood was great and rapid after the late Rains, and I thought of looking for a Place of &s;moother Water for my Pa&s;&s;age, when a Gentleman and Lady, attended by a Train of Servants, came riding along the Banks. As they rode, chatting and laughing, a Fowler, who was concealed in a Cop&s;e ju&s;t at Hand, let fly at a Bird; whereupon, the fiery Hor&s;e, that the Gentleman was on, took Fright, and, with a Bound, &s;ud|denly plunged into the Current; whereat the Lady gave a loud Shriek, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the Ground. The Hor&s;e ro&s;e without his Rider, and &s;wam down the Stream. Soon after, the Rider appeared, and the Attendants were divided between
<PB N="192" REF="193">their Care of the Lady and their Lamenta|tions for their Ma&s;ter on the Edge of the Bank. Then, &s;eeing no other Help, my Heart &s;mote me, and I ca&s;t my&s;elf in with|out Reflection. I kept aloof, however, for fear he &s;hould grapple at me and &s;ink us both together. So, I &s;upported and &s;hov|ed him before me toward Land, till, hav|ing reached the Bank, I laid hold on it with one Hand, and with the other rai&s;ed him up within the Reach of his Servants, who had &s;tretched them&s;elves flat upon the Brink to receive him. Then, being alrea|dy drenched, and having nothing further to do, I turned and &s;wam over, and &s;o made my E&s;cape.</P>
<P>Did you a&s;k the Name of the Party, whom you &s;aved in the Manner you &s;ay? No truly, Sir, there was no Lei&s;ure for &s;uch an Enquiry.&mdash;Why did you not wait for the Recompen&s;e that was &s;o ju&s;tly your Due for &s;o great a Deliverance?&mdash;Recom|pen&s;e? plea&s;e your Honour, I could have done no le&s;s for the Beggar who begs at the Corner.</P>
<P>Noble, noble Fellow! exclaimed Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I am he, I am he whom you &s;aved that Day, my Brother!&mdash;And &s;o &s;aying, he aro&s;e, and caught <HI>Homely</HI> in his Arms, and pre&s;&s;ed, and pre&s;&s;ed him over again to his Bo&s;om. While <HI>Harry,</HI> all impatient,
<PB N="193" REF="194">&s;eized hold of <HI>Homely</HI> al&s;o, and &s;truggled hard to get him to him&s;elf from his Fa|ther.</P>
<P>When they were &s;omething compo&s;ed, and All again &s;eated. Ah, <HI>Homely,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I have &s;ent and made many Enquiries after You; but, not for many Years after the Day in which you &s;aved me. I hated, I loathed you for having prolong|ed my Life to &s;uch a Mi&s;ery as no other Man ever endured. O&mdash;h, that Lady, that Lady!&mdash;But, no Matter for the pre&s;ent&mdash;(and, &s;o &s;aying, he wiped the &s;welling Tear from his Eye.)&mdash;Tell me, <HI>Homely.</HI>&mdash;That Devil, Sir <HI>Free&s;tone!</HI>&mdash;I am not of a malicious Temper, and yet I wi&s;h for nothing more than full Ven|geance on his Head.&mdash;Don't you believe that he went to You, with a felonious In|tention of defrauding you of your Proper|ty?&mdash;Believe it, Sir? I can &s;wear it. The Circum&s;tances and their Con&s;equences are full Evidence thereof.</P>
<P>Very well, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> though we may not be able to carry a civil Action again&s;t him; we may a&s;&s;ail him with bet|ter Advantage in a criminal Way. I will draw up and take your Depo&s;ition, my|&s;elf; and, to-morrow, I will &s;end you with a Note to Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> where more may be done for you, my <HI>Homely,</HI> than you think.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195">
In the mean time, You and your Fami|ly &s;hall take up your Abode in the back Part of my Hou&s;e, and from thence You &s;hall not depart till, as your <HI>Peggy</HI>'s Dream has it, all your Lo&s;&s;es &s;hall be re&s;tored to You &s;evenfold upon Earth; what your Portion may be in Heaven mu&s;t be your own Care, and may the Spirit of Grace guide You in the Way you &s;hould go.</P>
<P>Early the next Morning, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;ent <HI>Homely</HI> to <HI>London</HI> with his Depo&s;ition and &s;everal Papers, accompanied by a Let|ter from him&s;elf to Lord <HI>Portland.</HI> In the Evening <HI>Homely</HI> returned, and, entering with a Face of Triumph, he &s;eized Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Hand, and eagerly ki&s;&s;ing it, Ble&s;&s;|ed, ble&s;&s;ed be the Hand, he cried, that hath the Power of God, among Men, for good Works. When I &s;ent in your Ho|nour's Letter, I was not detained a Mo|ment. His Lord&s;hip made me &s;it down, peru&s;ed my Papers with Attention, que&s;|tioned me on the Particulars, grew en|flamed again&s;t Sir <HI>Free&s;tone,</HI> and gave him two or three hearty Cur&s;es for an exe|crable Villain. He then called a Gentle|man to him who was in waiting, and or|dered an Attachment to be in&s;tantly i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the Knight. It was accordingly executed upon him, and he now lies in
<PB N="195" REF="196">Newgate. God be prai&s;ed! &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fen|ton,</HI> &s;o far there is Equity &s;till extant upon Earth.</P>
<P>It is not unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Family were immoderately fond of Tho&s;e, who&s;e Father had &s;aved the Life of their mo&s;t dear Ma&s;ter. Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> in particular, took Pains and Plea&s;ure in for|warding the Boys in their Letters; and Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her Time very happily with <HI>Peggy</HI> and her little Girls.</P>
<P><HI>Frank,</HI> the Butler, had been abroad up|on an Expedition, at the time that Mr. <HI>Homely</HI>'s Family arrived; and did not re|turn till <HI>Homely</HI> had come back from Lord <HI>Portland</HI>'s. He was then informed, with Joy, of the Gue&s;ts they had got; and he waited with Impatience, till the Man he longed to &s;ee &s;hould come out from his Ma&s;ter. As &s;oon as he appeared, he catch|ed one of his Hands in both of his, and, looking lovingly at him, cried, Do I once more behold that happy Face, Mr. <HI>Homely?</HI> I was the Man to who&s;e Hands you deli|vered my precious Lord from the devouring of the Floods. Gladly, Heaven knows, would I have &s;acrificed my own Life for the Salvation of his. But, alas! I had no Skill in contending with the Waters, and the &s;ure Lo&s;s of my own Life would not have given the &s;malle&s;t Chance for the Recovery
<PB N="196" REF="197">of my Ma&s;ter. You are the Per&s;on, Mr. <HI>Homely,</HI> to whom God committed that ble&s;&s;ed Ta&s;k and Tru&s;t. And Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and I, and all of us have agreed to make up a hundred Pound, apiece, for your Children, in Acknowledgment of the Bene|fit you did us on that Day.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Homely</HI> took <HI>Frank</HI> very affectio|nately into his Arms, and, with a faulter|ing Voice, &s;aid, Your Offer, Sir, is dear, very dear, indeed, unto me, as it is a Proof of that Love which you All &s;o warmly bear to our common Lord and Ma&s;ter. If there is any Occa&s;ion, I will not refu&s;e this extraordinary In&s;tance of your Benevo|lence; but, our Ma&s;ter's Influence and Bounty are doing much in my Behalf. And, in the mean time, I will take it as a very particular Favour, if you will be plea&s;|ed to introduce me to my Fellow-Servants of this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Within the following Fortnight, a Ser|vant came, on a foaming Hor&s;e, and in a golden Livery, delivered a Letter at the Door, and rode away directly.</P>
<P>The Letter ran thus:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Day following Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;ent <HI>Har|ry,</HI> in his Chariot, attended by Mr. <HI>James</HI> and two Servants in Livery, to return his Acknowledgments to the Favourite of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">
Lord <HI>Portland</HI> received our Hero with Plea&s;ure and Surpri&s;e equally evident in his Countenance. As he, unknowingly, piqued him&s;elf on being One of the fine&s;t Per&s;o|nages in the Nation, he &s;ecretly re&s;pected his own Re&s;emblance in Another.</P>
<P>After a few mutual Compliments and &s;ome occa&s;ional Di&s;cour&s;e, the Earl told <HI>Harry</HI> that he mu&s;t take a private Dinner with him. We are quite alone, &s;ays he, only two Vi&s;counts, a Baronet, and four or five Gentlemen of the Mini&s;terial Quill. Pray, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>Harry</HI> &s;miling, is a Dinner the whole of their Pen&s;ion? Not &s;o, Sir, I confe&s;s; they are the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> of the letter'd World, and fight for Pay. They were formerly of the oppo&s;ite Junto; but they have changed their Opinions along with their Party; and our Honour obliges us to give them at lea&s;t as much in the Cau&s;e of the Crown, as they formerly got in the Cau&s;e of the Populace. I doubt, my Lord, returned <HI>Harry,</HI> that their Si|lence would an&s;wer your Ends, full as well as their Oratory, unle&s;s your Trea&s;ury could hold out in bribing People to read al&s;o. Very plea&s;antly &s;evere, indeed, replied the laughing Earl. But come, the Bell calls us to our Bit.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200">
When Dinner was over, and Cheer cir|culating with the Bottle, I would give a good deal to know, Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, what you and your Father think of his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters? Should I &s;peak my downright Sentiments, my Lord, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> in &s;ome Things I might offend, and in Others appear to flatter. O, you cannot offend, in the lea&s;t, cried the Earl; we are daily accu&s;tomed to be told of all the Faults, whereof we are, or may be, or might have been guil|ty; and, as to Flattery, you know it is the Food of us Courtiers. Why, my Lord, you want no Champion, for the pre&s;ent, &s;aid <HI>Harry;</HI> You are All, as I perceive, on one Side of the Que&s;tion; and if &s;ome One does not appear, however impotent to oppo&s;e You, the Shuttlecock of Conver&s;a|tion may fall to the Ground. Right, very right, my &s;weet Fellow, rejoined his Lord|&s;hip; proceed, you &s;hall have nothing but fair Play, I promi&s;e you.</P>
<P>To be &s;erious then, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> my Fa|ther thinks, in the fir&s;t Place, (for I have no Manner of Skill in &s;uch Matters) he thinks, I &s;ay, that his Maje&s;ty is one of the greate&s;t Warriors and One of the wi&s;e&s;t State&s;men that ever exi&s;ted. He thinks, however, that he has Attachments and Views that look &s;omething further than
<PB N="200" REF="201">the mere Intere&s;ts of the People by whom he has been elected; but he &s;ays that tho&s;e Views ought, in a Mea&s;ure, to be indulg|ed, in return of the very great Benefits that he has done us. He is, therefore, grieved to find that his Maje&s;ty has met with &s;o much Reluctance and Coldne&s;s from a Nation &s;o obliged.</P>
<P>You are a Darling of a Politician, ex|claimed the Earl; but we will not thank you for your Compliments, till we know what you have further to object again&s;t us.</P>
<P>My Father admits, my Lord, that his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters have re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and exhibited, in fair and open Light, the mo&s;t glorious Con&s;titution that ever was con&s;tructed. But then, he appre|hends that You are beginning to &s;ap the Foundations of the Pile that You, your|&s;elves, erected.</P>
<P>As how, my dear young <HI>Mentor?</HI> By being over bounteous in paying former Friends, and by being &s;till more profu&s;e in procuring new Adherents.&mdash;Child of Honour, cried the Earl; Another, le&s;s ele|gant than your&s;elf, would have &s;aid that we are &s;apping the Con&s;titution by <HI>Bribery</HI> and <HI>Corruption.</HI> You have, indeed, my <HI>Harry,</HI> delicately tempered your Admoni|tions,
<PB N="201" REF="202">even like the Cup of Life, the Sweets with the Bitters. But, what &s;ay You, Gentlemen, &s;hall a Babe, lately from the Brea&s;t, bear away the whole Palm from People grown grey in Politicks?</P>
<P>The young Gentleman, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Veer</HI> (the Principal of the Court-Writers) talks wonderfully for One not ver&s;ed in the Sub|ject of which he treats. The People of <HI>England</HI> are &s;tupidly proud and licentiou&s;|ly ungovernable; they are the mo&s;t ignorant and yet mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of any People upon Earth; it is only by their being &s;elfi&s;h that they become in any Degree manageable; if their Voices were not bought, they would either give them to Per&s;ons of their own &s;tupid Ca&s;t, unknowing in our Laws or our Con&s;titution, or to Men of an anti|monarchal and republican Spirit, who would be perpetually putting Rubs before the Wheels of good Government.</P>
<P>I never knew, till now, Sir, returned <HI>Harry,</HI> that, in order to make People true to their Country and their King, that is, in order to make Men hone&s;t, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to corrupt them. But I have &s;till good Hopes that the Picture, which you have drawn of our Governors, is not alto|gether a ju&s;t One.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
Governors? cries <HI>Veer,</HI> I &s;poke not a Word of Governors. You &s;poke of the People, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> and they, as I take it, are our Governors. The People our Governors! this is the mo&s;t wonderful and the newe&s;t Doctrine that ever I hear'd, A Doctrine even as old as the Con&s;titution, rejoins <HI>Harry:</HI> They are not only our Go|vernors, but more ab&s;olutely &s;o than Any &s;o &s;tiled. His Lord&s;hip is the only Man in Company who&s;e Per&s;on, in &s;ome In|&s;tances, is exempt from their Juri&s;diction; but his Property remains &s;till &s;ubjected to their Deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>No Law can be made in <HI>Britain</HI> but by the People, in their Proxies. And when tho&s;e Laws are made, the People are again con&s;tituted the Judges thereof on their <HI>Jury-Tribunals,</HI> throughout their re&s;pective Shires; as al&s;o Judges of Facts and Rights, whether civil or criminal, throughout the Realm.</P>
<P>Thus, their Privilege of making Laws for them&s;elves in PARLIAMENT, and of judging of the &s;aid Laws (when made) on JURIES, compo&s;es, as it were, a Rudder, whereby the People are admitted (gloriou&s;|ly) to &s;teer the Ve&s;&s;el of their own Com|mon-Wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
Would it not be a Pity then that &s;o great a People &s;hould be no Other than Such as Mr. <HI>Veer</HI> has de&s;cribed them, a Parcel of ignorant, licentious, &s;elfi&s;h, ba&s;e, venal Pro&s;titutes, unenlightened by Rea&s;on and uninfluenced by Con&s;cience?</P>
<P>If they &s;hould be reduced, if it is po&s;&s;i|ble, I &s;ay, that they &s;hould ever be reduced to &s;o very vile and deplorable a State, it can only be by the very Mea&s;ures that Mr. <HI>Veer</HI> has recommended. The Character, as ye know, of a certain old Tempter is not over amiable, and I &s;hould be &s;orry that Any, whom I love and re&s;pect, &s;hould follow in his Steps.</P>
<P>And now, Gentlemen, take the Argu|ment home to your&s;elves. The People have the Di&s;po&s;al of our Lives, Liberties, and Properties. Which of You then would like to have Life it&s;elf and all that is valuable in it, at the Arbitration of a Pack of Wretches who, being wholly &s;el|fi&s;h, can have no kindred Feelings or Com|pa&s;&s;ion for You? Who being, them&s;elves, devoid of Honour and Equity, cannot judge according to the One or the Other; who, being already accu&s;tomed to Influence and Pro&s;titution, have their Ears and Hands open to All who would whi&s;per or bribe them to your Prejudice?</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205">
I, as a Fool, Gentlemen, utter the Dic|tates of Wi&s;dom, for I &s;peak the Senti|ments of a much wi&s;er and much better Man than my&s;elf. Should a general Cor|ruption take Place in the Land, adieu to all Virtue; adieu to Humanity and all &s;ocial Connections! all Rea&s;on and Law, all Con|&s;cience and Magi&s;tracy, all public and private Weal, mu&s;t vani&s;h or be confound|ed in one Chaos together. And, from hence it is &s;elf-evident that He, who de|bauches the Morals of the Lea&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, is an Enemy to his King, to his Country and Mankind.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, with &s;ome little Confu&s;ion, I never beheld this Matter in the &s;ame Light before; but I &s;hall take Care to in&s;pect and examine it at better Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Here the Company ro&s;e to &s;eparate; when <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;tepping toward <HI>Veer</HI> with an affectionate Plea&s;antry in his Counte|nance; Mr. <HI>Veer,</HI> &s;ays he, I fear I have mi&s;behaved a little to Day, I am naturally warm, and am apt to be too much &s;o on particular Subjects. O Sir, &s;ays <HI>Veer,</HI> I am an old Prizefighter, and accu&s;tomed to Cuts; but I now know my Man, and &s;hall hereafter avoid engaging, or keep barely on
<PB N="205" REF="206">the Defen&s;ive; do me the Honour, how|ever, as old Combatants were wont, to &s;hake Hands, at parting, in Token of Hearts free from Malice. In the Conte&s;t of Love, Mr. <HI>Veer,</HI> you never &s;hall foil me, cried <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my Lord, if you have any Com|mands for my Father, pray let me have the Plea&s;ure of being your Me&s;&s;enger. Upon my Honour, my dear Boy, and that is the Oath of a Lord, you &s;hall not part me, for this Night at lea&s;t. My Father, Sir, will be unea&s;y. I will di&s;patch One to him directly; I have particular De&s;igns upon you; you mu&s;t with me to the Levee; I cannot refu&s;e my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of in|troducing you to his Maje&s;ty; I expect to get Credit by you. I rather fear, my Lord, that I may do you &s;ome Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>O, cried the Earl, you think you are not fine enough. Why, truly, you will &s;ee Folk there, of much more lu&s;trous Attire. But, let Others di&s;grace their Or|naments; be you humbly content, my Child, with adorning your Dre&s;s. <HI>Harry</HI> blu&s;hed and bowed.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Court, the Earl left his young Friend awhile in the Levee-Room, and went to impart &s;ome Matters to the King in his Clo&s;et.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
While our Hero &s;tood in the Crowd, &s;ome One came and, with Birdlime, &s;tuck a Paper to his Back, whereon was written in capital Letters, THE FOOL.</P>
<P>However, it did not remain long enough to do him much Di&s;grace. A young Gen|tleman, of a graceful Figure and very amiable A&s;pect, pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e behind <HI>Harry,</HI> and gently &s;tole the Writing away; then, taking him by the Hand, reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him apart.</P>
<P>I wonder, Sir, &s;aid the Stranger, who it was that could be &s;o malicious, or &s;o ba&s;e as to fa&s;ten this Title on your Back; I am certain he mu&s;t never have &s;een your Face. O Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> blu&s;hing and &s;miling together, this mu&s;t have been the Office of &s;ome old Acquaintance; it is the Title to which I have been accu&s;tomed from my Infancy; and I am well contented to carry it with me to the Grave; I am much affected, Sir, however, by this un|common In&s;tance of your Humanity to an Unknown; pray add to the Obligation by letting me know to whom it is that I am &s;o endearingly bound.</P>
<P>My Name, Sir, is <HI>William Thornhill.</HI> I am ju&s;t arrived from my Travels; and I would willingly go my long Journey over
<PB N="207" REF="208">again to become ju&s;t &s;uch another Fool as you are.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> &s;eized him by the Hand, and gave him at once the Squeeze and the Look of Love.&mdash;Sir <HI>William Thornhill,</HI> I pre&s;ume?&mdash;The Same, my dear Sir&mdash;I have been enamoured of your Character before I &s;aw You, Sir <HI>William.</HI> My Name is <HI>Harry Fenton;</HI> I live on <HI>Ham&s;tead Hill;</HI> I &s;ee that your Plea&s;ure lies in communi|cating Plea&s;ure, I am therefore per&s;uaded you will indulge me with a Call, at &s;ome lei&s;ure Hour&mdash;I will not defer that Ad|vantage a &s;ingle Day&mdash;I &s;hall have the Lougings of a Lover, till you arrive.</P>
<P>Here the King entered, and all Con|ver&s;e was broken off. Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> looking about, di&s;covered <HI>Harry,</HI> and, tak|ing him by the Hand, led him up and left him &s;tanding before his Maje&s;ty. Then, approaching the royal Ear, may it plea&s;e you, Sire, &s;ays he, this is the Son of the Gentleman who advanced us two hundred thou&s;and Pounds on our Expedition from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The King turned to <HI>Harry</HI> with a &s;olemn and piercing Look; and, having eyed him for &s;ome Time, he again turned to the Earl and cried; Ay, <HI>Portland,</HI> this is Something, this, indeed, is a Gem fit to &s;et
<PB N="208" REF="209">in the Crown of a Monarch. He then reached forth his Hand, and while our Hero &s;tooped to ki&s;s it, He pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Harry</HI>'s Shoulder with his other Hand.</P>
<P>My dear Child, &s;aid the King, we are much obliged to your Father. You, by Inheritance, are attached to our Crown, and you may ju&s;tly demand whatever we can be&s;tow. We humbly thank Your Ma|je&s;ty, an&s;wer'd <HI>Harry,</HI> we only claim the Privilege of &s;erving you with all our Hearts and all our Powers.</P>
<P>What Po&s;t would you choo&s;e, my Dear, in the Army, or in the Court? indeed, I &s;hould be&s;t like to have You about my own Per&s;on. That is the Pitch to which I a&s;|pire, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> as &s;oon as I am ca|pable of &s;o high a Duty.</P>
<P>But, why have you been &s;uch a Stranger, &s;aid the King; had we &s;een you before, I think we &s;hould not have forgot you. O Sire, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> I am but as a Bird from the Ne&s;t, and this is the fir&s;t of my unfledg|ed Excur&s;ions. If a Bird, cried the King, it mu&s;t be a young Eagle. Not &s;o, Sire, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> I &s;hould then better &s;up|port the Brightne&s;s of the Sun that is now before me.&mdash;I would give one of my King|doms that you were my Son!&mdash;I am al|ready One of Millions of happy Sons and
<PB N="209" REF="210">Daughters who have the Glory of calling You their royal Father!</P>
<P>So &s;aying, our Hero bowed twice, and drew back; while the King looked toward him, in Silence and Wonder.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Talk with his Courtiers, his Maje&s;ty retired. And Lord <HI>Portland</HI> took <HI>Harry,</HI> and was followed by a Number of the young Gentry, to the Ball-Room.</P>
<P>There the Queen, at the upper End, was &s;eated under a Canopy, her Maids of Honour attending, and two brilliant Ranges of Foreign and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies, were &s;eated on either Hand.</P>
<P>The Earl gave a Whi&s;per to the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, and he immediately led <HI>Harry</HI> up to the Pre&s;ence, where he had the Honour of ki&s;&s;ing Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s fair Hand.</P>
<P>After &s;ome whi&s;pering Chat between her Maje&s;ty and Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> the Ball was ordered to be opened by our Hero and the lovely young Prince&s;s of <HI>He&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>All Eyes were fixed upon them, with Attention &s;till as Night, while they moved like <HI>Homer</HI>'s Gods, without &s;eeming to pre&s;s the Ground; or like a Mi&s;t, before
<PB N="210" REF="211">the Breeze, along the Side of &s;ome &s;tately Hill.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Minuet was clo&s;ed, the Prince&s;s &s;aid &s;oftly to <HI>Harry,</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Louvre,</HI> Sir, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>This was a Dance of the newe&s;t Fa&s;hion, and was calculated to &s;hew forth and ex|hibit a graceful Per&s;on in all the po&s;&s;ible Elegances of Movement and Attitude.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had fini&s;hed, the whole A&s;&s;embly could &s;carce refrain from break|ing forth in loud Plaudits, as at the pub|lic Theatre; and a Humming of mixed Voices and patting Feet was heard through|out.</P>
<P>When <HI>Harry</HI> had led the Prince&s;s to her Seat, and left her with a Bow of the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive Re&s;pect, He looked about for &s;ome Lady whom he might choo&s;e in Succe&s;&s;ion; and, &s;pying Lady <HI>Loui&s;a Bottom</HI> at the oppo&s;ite Side, he &s;tepped toward her, and, bending, gracefully offered to lead her forth.</P>
<P>She gave him her Hand, tremblingly, and whi&s;pered, as &s;he ro&s;e, You are a great Stranger, Sir, but we de&s;erve you &s;hould be &s;o, &s;ince we did not treat you with the Re&s;pect that your Merit &s;hould
<PB N="211" REF="212">have commanded. That, Madam, an|&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> is not wholly the Cau&s;e of my Di&s;tance; but, there are Per&s;ons who&s;e Loveline&s;s is more formidable to me, than an Arrangement of &s;abred Hu&s;&s;ars with their fierce looking Mu&s;taches.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had no &s;ooner &s;aid this than his Heart &s;mote him with Remor&s;e; for, though <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was indeed lovely, and that he felt for her the Propen&s;ities and Tenderne&s;s of a Brother; yet, She was not of that Spe|cies of Beauty that was formed to fix his Heart: And he &s;ecretly reproached him|&s;elf for having attempted to rai&s;e the Vani|ty, or draw the Affections of an innocent Girl, with no further View than of making a Parade of his own Talents; a Mea&s;ure, he ju&s;tly judged, unbecoming a Man of a Spark of Honour or Integrity.</P>
<P>When <HI>Harry</HI> had fini&s;hed, and left <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> on the Floor; the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremo|nies honoured Sir <HI>William Thornhill</HI> with her Hand; and, after four or five more Mi|nuets by the younger Folk, the Parties were appointed and paired for Country Dances; except young Lord <HI>Bottom,</HI> who refu&s;ed to &s;tep forth, and &s;at apart, rumi|nating and feeding on his own Cogitations.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s and our Hero led up the Dance, and <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and Sir <HI>William</HI> were
<PB N="212" REF="213">appointed the next in Cour&s;e, in order to do the principal Honours to the two young Strangers.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Dances were ended, and that All had mixed, and chatted, and roved about awhile, <HI>Harry</HI> ob&s;erved Sir <HI>William</HI> coming toward him in a little Flu&s;ter. What is the Matter, my Friend, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> pray what has di&s;compo&s;ed you?&mdash;Tell me, my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> that Jackanapes in the Blue and Gold, do you know who he is? I prote&s;t, had it not been for the Re|&s;pect I owe the Pre&s;ence, I would have cha&s;ti&s;ed him on the Spot. The Dance was no &s;ooner done, than he came up with a mo&s;t provoking Saucine&s;s in his Look. I wonder, Sir, &s;aid he, at the In&s;olence of One of your Rank; you ought to have had more Mode&s;ty than to &s;uffer your&s;elf to be paired with a Lady &s;o far above You.</P>
<P>O, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> taking Sir <HI>William</HI> very lovingly under the Arm, pa&s;s this Matter over, my &s;weet Friend, I be&s;eech you. That is young Lord <HI>Bottom,</HI> the very Per|&s;on who, I'm pretty confident, contrived the honour of the <HI>Pa&s;quinade</HI> on my Back this Day. But, he is Brother to the &s;weet Girl with whom you danced. For her Sake, for my Sake, forgive him, I entreat you; but, above all, forgive him for the Sake of
<PB N="213" REF="214">his dear Father the Earl of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> One of the noble&s;t Nobles, and One of the wor|thie&s;t Men that ever &s;tept on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground. He has been, the&s;e two Years pa&s;t, abroad upon an Emba&s;&s;y; and, while he is promoting the Intere&s;ts of the Public, has left his own Hou&s;hold uncha&s;tened and unguided.</P>
<P>Here, the Conver&s;e of the Friends was &s;uddenly broken off. The Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies came and, tapping <HI>Harry</HI> on the Shoulder, told him that the Queen de|&s;ired to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P>When he had, with a lowly Reverence, advanced to the Throne; You are, &s;aid the Queen, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Cavalier that ever I beheld; and, had I &s;ufficient Youth and Beauty, I would choo&s;e You for my Knight to bear my Fame through the World. I would rather, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> that your Maje&s;ty would employ me on &s;ome more dangerous Enterprize. How is that, &s;aid the Queen? Why, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> your Maje&s;ty's Champion could have little or nothing to do, as All would willingly ac|knowledge the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>You are, cryed the Queen, the lovelie&s;t and the &s;weete&s;t Fellow I ever knew. My Eye has followed you all along, and marked
<PB N="214" REF="215">You for my Own, and I mu&s;t either beg or &s;teal You from our good Friend your Father. I, therefore, want no Token to put me in mind of You, but You may want &s;ome Token to keep your Friends in your Memory. Here are two Pictures; the One is the Portrait of our Ma&s;ter and &s;overeign Lord, ju&s;tly enriched with Dia|monds to the value of &s;ome Thou&s;ands. The Other is the Picture of the Woman who &s;its before you, lowly, &s;imple, and unadorned; choo&s;e which you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Give me the plain Picture, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> with a kind of Rapture, it &s;hall henceforth become my Riches and my Ornament.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he bent his Knee, and, tak|ing the little Portrait, he pre&s;&s;ed it to his Lips with the Ardour of an ancient Lover in Romance. Then, putting it into his Bo&s;om, he gracefully ro&s;e; made three re|tiring Bows, and went from the Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>O, The Fool, the egregious Fool! mut|tered Some. Nobly, mo&s;t nobly done, cried Others!</P>
<P>As <HI>Harry</HI> was following the Earl of <HI>Port|land</HI> through the Palace-Gate, Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> came up with the Crowd and, in a half Whi&s;per, &s;aid; You are too great a Man
<PB N="215" REF="216">to Day, Sir, to acknowledge your old Ac|quaintance. But not &s;o great a FOOL, re|torted <HI>Harry,</HI> as not to be taught my Di&s;|tance with Tho&s;e who, like Lord <HI>Bottom,</HI> have a Right to look down upon me.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort but &s;ound Sleep, <HI>Harry</HI> hurried Home to prepare for the Reception of his new Friend. He told Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> that Sir <HI>William</HI> was returned; how he had been obligingly made known to him in the forementioned In&s;tance of his Humani|ty to a Stranger; and that he had promi&s;ed to be with them that Morning. But, pray Sir, don't tell <HI>Homely</HI> a Word of the com|ing of his Landlord, till we place them, as it were by Surprize, Face to Face.</P>
<P>In about an Hour after, a Chai&s;e and Four came rapidly to the Door; and <HI>Harry</HI> in&s;tantly &s;prung out, and caught his Friend in his Arms before he came to the Ground.</P>
<P>The two Friends entered the Parlour, care&s;&s;ing and care&s;&s;ed, and ca&s;ting Looks of cordial Love and Delight on Each-Other. My Father, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> and led Sir <HI>William</HI> by the Hand to Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> who received him with a Countenance of that Heart-&s;peaking Complai&s;ance, which never fails to attach the Soul of the Per&s;on to whom it is directed. Ah, my <HI>Harry,</HI> cri|ed Sir <HI>William,</HI> I no longer wonder at
<PB N="216" REF="217">You; I &s;ee that You are All, that you are, by Inheritance.</P>
<P>But Sir, continued he, You had like to have lo&s;t your Son, la&s;t Night. Their Maje&s;ties were mo&s;t unwilling to quit their Hold of him, and, I believe in my Soul, would willingly have adopted him the Heir of their Crown. I &s;hould be very &s;orry, Sir <HI>William,</HI> replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> to &s;ee a Circle about his Head, that would give him an aching Heart. I am &s;ure that is the Ca&s;e with the pre&s;ent royal Proprie|tors. In a limited Monarchy like ours, the Station of the Prince is looked upon with a malignant Eye by the Envious, and, at the &s;ame Time, rendered unea&s;y by the perpetual Conte&s;ts, between Rights and Pri|vileges, on the one Part, and Prerogative on the Other.</P>
<P>Moreover, Sir <HI>William,</HI> I &s;hall never wi&s;h to &s;ee One, of my Child's Di&s;po&s;ition, on the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> I &s;hould be jealous of &s;uch a Per&s;on, in Behalf of my Country. No People could be more tenacious of their Liberties than the <HI>Swedes,</HI> till <HI>Gu&s;tavus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Erie,</HI> a&s;cended the Throne. His Manners were &s;o amiable, his Virtues &s;o con&s;picuous, his Government &s;o ju&s;t, and he made &s;o popular a U&s;e of all his Powers, that his Subjects thought
<PB N="217" REF="218">they could never commit enough into his Hands. But, what was the Con&s;equence? His Succe&s;&s;ors made his Power a Prece|dent for their Own, without attending to the Precedent of his Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Thus, you &s;ee, that a Prince, of Qua|lities eminently popular, might prove of dangerous Tendency to a free People, for|a&s;much as he might charm the Eyes of their Jealou&s;y to &s;leep, and &s;o &s;educe them from that Guard, which is ever nece&s;&s;ary to preclude the Encroachments of Am|bition.</P>
<P>But, Sir <HI>William,</HI> may we not order your Hor&s;es up? You mu&s;t not think of going till you take a plain Dinner with us. A Supper too, Sir, mo&s;t joyfully, an&s;wer|ed the Knight. I leave <HI>London</HI> in the Morning, on a certain Expedition, and &s;hall not have the Plea&s;ure of embracing you again, for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Here the Bell was rung, and the Cattle and Carriage di&s;po&s;ed of. When Mr. <HI>Fen|ton</HI> thus addre&s;&s;ed the Baronet, with a Smile. Our <HI>Harry</HI> here, Sir <HI>William,</HI> ne|ver &s;aw a Court, before; it is natural there|fore to think that he mu&s;t have been great|ly amu&s;ed, and his young Heart deceived by the Splendor and Parade. But you have &s;een, and ob&s;erved upon many Courts, of
<PB N="218" REF="219">late; pray what do you think of the En|tertainment they afford?</P>
<P>As of the dulle&s;t of all dull Farces, an|&s;wered the Knight. All the Courts that I have &s;een are nearly of the &s;ame Ca&s;t. Conceive to your&s;elf, Sir, a Stage or Thea|tre of Comedians, without Auditors or Spectators. They are All Actors and all Act, nearly, the &s;ame Part, of &s;olemn Com|plai&s;ance and nau&s;eous Grimace. Each in|tends to impo&s;e, and yet no One is impo|&s;ed upon; where Profe&s;&s;ions are taken to imply the very Rever&s;e of what they ex|pre&s;s.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay to this, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton?</HI> I have very little to &s;ay, Sir, in favour of the Actors, but the Actre&s;&s;es, as I take it, afford better Entertainment. Here, Sir <HI>William</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> laugh|ed; and <HI>Harry,</HI> upon a Wink, &s;tepped out to bring in <HI>Homely,</HI> as it were by &s;tealth.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> there is a Man come to this Hou&s;e, who once &s;aved my Life at the ri&s;que of his Own. It is a great many Years ago, and I have not &s;een him &s;ince the Action, till very lately. I have &s;ent <HI>Harry</HI> for him, that you may learn the Particulars, and advi&s;e with me what Recompen&s;e he ought to receive.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">
If the Recompen&s;e is to be proportioned to the Value of the Life he &s;aved, my honoured Sir, I &s;hould not know where to fix the Bounds of Retribution. And in Truth, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> from my Knowledge of you this Day, I al&s;o hold my&s;elf very highly his Debtor.</P>
<P>At this In&s;tant <HI>Harry</HI> led in <HI>Homely</HI> by the Hand, and left him &s;tanding directly oppo&s;ite to the Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Homely</HI> gazed with all his Eyes, and &s;tood mute through A&s;toni&s;hment.&mdash;At length he exclaimed, Ble&s;s me!&mdash;Mercy upon me!&mdash;as &s;ure as I hope for Heaven,&mdash;it is&mdash;I think it is, my dear young Ma&s;ter!</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William,</HI> at the Voice, lifted up his Eyes to <HI>Homely,</HI> and, remembering his marked Man, ro&s;e quickly and, &s;pringing forward, embraced him with much familiar Affection; while Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;at, and his <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tood be&s;ide him, Both rapt in their own delicious Sen&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>My dear <HI>Homely,</HI> my old Companion and brother Sport&s;man! cried Sir <HI>William,</HI> how in the World comes this about? &s;o joyfully, &s;o unexpectedly to meet you here! &mdash; How is your Wife, and pretty Babes? I hope you left All well at Home.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">
Yes, plea&s;e your Honour, they are All well, wonderfully well in this Hou&s;e, I a&s;|&s;ure you; for, indeed, your <HI>Homely</HI> has no other Home upon Earth.</P>
<P>What you tell me is quite a&s;toni&s;hing, replied the Knight; no Home for you with|in the Manor and Deme&s;ne of your Friend? What Misfortunes, what Revolu|tions could bring this Wonder to pa&s;s?</P>
<P>Sit down, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> pray be &s;eated Mr. <HI>Homely,</HI> and give your Lord a &s;uccinct but deliberate Account of the inimitable Pair, Sir <HI>Free&s;tone</HI> and his Coadjutor.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Homely</HI> had told his Tale, from the Commencement of his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es to his Arrival at the Hovel, he &s;topped &s;hort and &s;aid &mdash; I have &s;omething more to impart, &mdash; but I hope your Honour will pardon me, &mdash; I am loth to deprive your Friends of your Company; but then my <HI>Peggy</HI> and my Boys will be &s;o tran&s;ported to &s;ee your dear Face again, that I can't but be&s;eech you to indulge them, a Minute or two, with that Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> ro&s;e, with a troubled Hu|manity in his Countenance, and followed to a back Apartment, where <HI>Homely</HI> again &s;topped him &s;hort; and, before he would take him to his <HI>Peggy,</HI> he there gave him
<PB N="221" REF="222">a minute Detail of all his Obligations to what he called this wonderful Family. But, pray Sir, continued he, let them know very little of what I have told you, for nothing puts them to &s;o much pain, as any kind of Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort Vi&s;it to <HI>Peggy</HI> and her Chil|dren, Sir <HI>William</HI> returned to his Friends, with &s;uch an inward Awe and Veneration for their Characters as, for a while, &s;unk his Spirits and &s;olemnized his Features. This poor Man, Sir, &s;aid he, has been mi|&s;erably treated; but God has been exceed|ingly gracious to him, in ca&s;ting the Ship|wreckt Wretch on &s;uch a happy Shore as this. But this makes no Di&s;charge of any Part of my Duty toward him.</P>
<P>Mark me, <HI>Homely,</HI> I am now of Age, and Lord <HI>Lechmore</HI> has no further Autho|rity in my Affairs; wherefore, before I leave this Hou&s;e, I will give you a Letter of At|torney for the whole Agency of the Manor. Thank your Honour, thank your Honour, cried <HI>Homely,</HI> in a Kind of Tran&s;port! if I do not prove as faithful to you as Another I will do you Ju&s;tice on my&s;elf with the fir&s;t Rope I can lay hold on.</P>
<P>As for that Reprobate <HI>Snack,</HI> continued the Knight, I will take Care to be up with him. He owes the Executors of my Fa|ther
<PB N="222" REF="223">&s;ix hundred and &s;eventy Pounds. I will have that Matter put directly in Suit, and, as &s;oon as it is recovered, it &s;hall be laid out on a Commi&s;&s;ion for your Son, my Friend <HI>Tom;</HI> as I do not choo&s;e yet to a&s;k any Favour from the Mini&s;try. La&s;tly, that you may no more be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for Rent, I will never accept a Penny of it, till all your Children are decently and com|petently provided for.</P>
<P>O Sir, exclaimed <HI>Homely,</HI> I &s;hall be too rich, quite overburdened; I &s;hall not know where to lay my Trea&s;ures. Not &s;o fa&s;t, my good Friend, replied Sir <HI>William,</HI> &s;mil|ing; you have not heard of the Draw-back that I propo&s;e to have upon you. When|ever I re&s;ide in the Country, You are to have a hot Di&s;h, ay and a cool Hog&s;head too, ready for me and my Company. A|greed, Sir, cried <HI>Homely,</HI> provided I may have the Liberty, during your Ab&s;ence, to drink your Honour's Health out of that &s;ame Hog&s;head. &mdash; A ju&s;t Re&s;erve, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> laughing. &mdash; And full as grateful as it is jovial, cried Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI> &mdash; Why, Gen|tlemen, rejoined <HI>Homely,</HI> a Man of Spirit would &s;corn to accept &s;uch Benefits, with|out making Conditions.</P>
<P>After twelve o'Clock at Night, and an affectionate and tender Adieu, Sir <HI>William</HI> &s;et out by Moon-light for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">
The two following Days, were employ|ed in preparing for <HI>Homely</HI>'s Departure; and a Coach and Four, with a Chai&s;e, were provided for the Conveyance of him and his Family.</P>
<P>The Night before their parting, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> de&s;ired that <HI>Homely</HI> and his Wi&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent to him to his Clo&s;et. As &s;oon as they entered, he clo&s;ed the Door. My dear Friends, &s;aid he, I may not be up in the Morning to take a timely Leave of you, it may do as well to go through that melancholy Office to Night. &mdash; Here, Mrs. <HI>Homely,</HI> here is &s;ome little Matter, apiece, toward beginning a Fortune for your three pretty Daughters. Pray, <HI>Home|ly,</HI> take Care to have it di&s;po&s;ed of for them upon good Securities. Here he put three Orders, upon his Banker, into <HI>Peggy</HI>'s Hand, Each con&s;i&s;ting of the Value of five hundred Pieces. Then, turning to <HI>Homely,</HI> and taking him &s;traitly in his Arms, God be with you and your dear <HI>Peggy,</HI> my <HI>Homely,</HI> he cried, and give us All a ble&s;&s;ed Meeting where Friends &s;hall part no more!</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Homely</HI> was pa&s;t utter|ance; but di&s;engaging, and flinging him|&s;elf at the Feet of his Patron, while <HI>Peg|gy</HI> kept on her Knees weeping and &s;ob|bing be&s;ide him; O, he cried, at length, Next to my God, O, next to my Lord
<PB N="224" REF="225">and my God! &mdash; My Lord, and my Ma&s;|ter, my Ma&s;ter and my Lord!</P>
<P>The next Morning, before Sun-ri&s;e, <HI>Har|ry</HI> was up, and, going to <HI>Homely</HI>'s Apart|ment, embraced him and his Wife. He then ki&s;&s;ed and care&s;&s;ed all the Girls and Boys, round, and gave to each of them a Gold Medal to keep him in their Remem|brance.</P>
<P>They then adjourned to the Hall, where they found already gathered, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> with their little <HI>Dicky,</HI> Mr. <HI>James, Frank, Andrew</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> with Mrs. <HI>Hannah, Su&s;an,</HI> and <HI>Sarah,</HI> &amp;c; all deplo|ring the Departure of their beloved Gue&s;ts. The Carriages were at the Door, and Time pre&s;&s;ed, when <HI>Homely</HI> and his <HI>Peggy,</HI> with open Arms, trembling Lips, and &s;welling Eyes, began to take their Leave. Then <HI>Homely</HI> cried aloud, God be with you, God be with you; never, never, till I get to Heaven, &s;hall I meet with &s;uch another dear A&s;&s;embly! All then broke aloud into Tears, and Sobbings; while <HI>Homely</HI> took his weeping <HI>Peggy</HI> by the Hand; and breaking forth, with a heavy Heart, placed her and his Family in the Carriages: And away they went, though in opulent Circum|&s;tances, yet with much more oppre&s;&s;ed Spirits, than when they arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="226">
Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> now judged it time to for|ward his <HI>Harry</HI>'s Education, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to his Knowledge of the World, of the Views, Plea&s;ures, Manners, Bents, Em|ployments, and Characters of Mankind.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e he propo&s;ed to leave <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;ole Regent of his Family. And, for a few Weeks, to &s;tay with <HI>Clement</HI> and <HI>Harry</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> there to &s;hew him what|ever might gratify his Curio&s;ity or merit his In&s;pection.</P>
<P>While the Coach was in waiting, and they All &s;tood on the Hill, the great City being extended in ample View beneath them, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> exclaimed: "O! <HI>London, London,</HI> thou Mau&s;oleum of dead Souls, how plea&s;ant art thou to the Eye, how beautiful in outward Pro&s;pect! but within how full of Rottenne&s;s and reeking Abomi|nations! They Dealers are all Students in the My&s;tery of Iniquity, of Frand and Im|po&s;ition on Ignorance and Credulity. Thy public Offices are hourly exerci&s;ed in Ex|actions and Extortion. Thy Courts of Judicature are bu&s;ied in the Sale, the De|lay, or Perver&s;ion of Ju&s;tice, they are &s;hut to the Injured and Indigent, but open to the wealthy Pleas of the Invader and Op|pre&s;&s;or. Thy Magi&s;tracy is often employ|ed in &s;ecretly countenancing and abetting the Breach of tho&s;e Laws it was in&s;tituted
<PB N="226" REF="227">to maintain. Thy Charities, &s;ub&s;cribed for the Support of the Poor, are lavi&s;hed by the Tru&s;tees in pampering the Rich, where Drunkenne&s;s &s;wallows till it wallows, and Gluttony &s;tuffs till it pants, and unbuttons and &s;tuffs again. Even the Great Ones of thy Court have audaciou&s;ly &s;miled away the Gloom and Horrors of Guilt, and re|fined, as it were, all the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s thereof, by new inverting Terms and palliating Phra&s;es. While the Millions that crowd and hurry through thy Streets, are univer|&s;ally occupied in &s;triving and &s;truggling, to ri&s;e by the Fall, to fatten by the Leanne&s;s, and to thrive by the Ruin of their Fellows. Thy Offences are rank, they &s;team and cloud the Face of Heaven. The Gulph al|&s;o is hollow beneath, that is one Day to re|ceive thee. But the Mea&s;ure of thy Abo|minations is not yet full; and the Number of thy Righteous hath hitherto exceeded the Proportion that was found in the fir&s;t <HI>Sodom."</HI></P>
<P>That Evening they went to the Opera, where <HI>Harry</HI> was &s;o captivated by the &s;en|timental Meltings and varied Harmony of the Airs, that he reque&s;ted Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> to permit him to be in&s;tructed on &s;ome In&s;tru|ment. Not by my Advice, my Dear, an|&s;wered Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I would not wi&s;h you to attempt any thing in which you may not excel. Mu&s;ic is a Science, that requires
<PB N="227" REF="228">the Application of a Man's whole Li&s;e in order to arrive at any Eminence. As it is enchanting in the Hand of a Ma&s;ter, it is al&s;o di&s;cordant and grateing in its inferior Degrees. Your Labours have been em|ployed to much more valuable Purpo&s;es; and I would not, as they &s;ay, give my Child's Time for a Song. <HI>Harry</HI> in&s;tantly acquie&s;ced, with the be&s;t Temper imagin|able; as the Will of his beloved Patron was, truely &s;peaking, his own Will; and that he only wanted to know it, to be at all Times, and on all Occa&s;ions, conforma|ble thereto.</P>
<P>A few following Days were employed in vi&s;iting the Tower, in &s;urveying the Ar|mory, Regalia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in viewing the royal Bea&s;ts, the Monument, and Exchanges, and la&s;tly, in contemplating the Solemnity of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Pile, with the marbled Effi|gies and monumental Depo&s;its of the Re|nowned in Death; the Place, as Mr. <HI>Fen|ton</HI> affectingly ob&s;erved, to which all the Living mu&s;t finally adjourn.</P>
<P>The next Night they went to the Thea|tre, to &s;ee the Feats of Signor <HI>Volanti,</HI> the celebrated <HI>Italian</HI> Po&s;turema&s;ter, Ropedan|cer and Equilibri&s;t. Such Wonders are now &s;o common as to be &s;carce entertain|ing; but, at that Time, they were received with Bur&s;ts and Roars of Applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="229">
Our Hero felt him&s;elf attached, by the &s;imilar Excellences of his own Activity in Another; and, going behind the Scenes, he acco&s;ted <HI>Volanti</HI> in <HI>French.</HI> Signor, &s;aid he, I have been highly entertained by your Performance this Night, and here are five Guineas in return of the Plea&s;ure you have given me. The Foreigner looked at <HI>Har|ry,</HI> and then at the Money, with a kind of A&s;toni&s;hment. I thank you, noble Sir, he cried, my poor Endeavours are &s;eldom &s;o liberally rewarded. Pray, how long do you &s;tay with us? In about a Fortnight, &s;o plea&s;e your Noblene&s;s, I intend to leave <HI>London.</HI> But, before I go, I would do &s;omething to leave a Name behind me. A Day or two before my Departure, I will fly from the Spire of Saint <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church, in the Sight of all the People; and this I will do <HI>gratis,</HI> or rather in Acknowledg|ment of the Favours I have received in this Kingdom. But is it po&s;&s;ible to exe|cute what you propo&s;e? With all Ea&s;e and Safety, Sir, I have done nearly as much, three Times in <HI>Germany,</HI> and once at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>Here an arch Thought &s;truck <HI>Harry,</HI> and, mu&s;ing a Moment, will you permit me, &s;aid he, to be the Conductor of this Affair? Allow me only to appoint the Day and draw up your Adverti&s;ement, and I
<PB N="229" REF="230">will make you a Pre&s;ent of twenty Pieces. Agreed, Sir, cried <HI>Volanti,</HI> and twenty thou&s;and Thanks to confirm the Bargain. Accept the&s;e five Guineas then, in Earne&s;t of my Engagement; my Servant, here, will tell or &s;hew you where I am to be found.</P>
<P>That Night, at Supper, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> remarked an unu&s;ual Plea&s;antry in the Mu&s;cles of his Darling's &s;weetly &s;ober Coun|tenance. My <HI>Harry</HI> I find, &s;aid he, does not always impart all his Secrets to his Friends; he has certainly &s;ome rogui&s;h Matter in Cogitation. <HI>Magicum calles,</HI> Sir, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> You are a Conjurer, that's certain. Why, the Public, as you know, Sir, have put the FOOL on me from my Birth; <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ays that Revenge is &s;weet as Honey to the Ta&s;te; and &s;o I am medi|tating in turn how to put the FOOL upon the Public. And how do you contrive it, <HI>Harry?</HI> only by acting the old Proverb, that, <HI>one Fool makes Many.</HI> But pray a&s;k me not about the Manner, till I bring the Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ome Bearing.</P>
<P>The next Day, being <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> they All went, in Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Coach, to <HI>Smith|field,</HI> where Numbers of Tents were &s;et up, and &s;everal Drolls and Pantomimes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> prepared, in Imitation of the Humours of <HI>Bartholemew</HI> Fair. The Weather was
<PB N="230" REF="231">fair and calm, and they let down all the Gla&s;&s;es, that they might &s;ee, without In|terruption, whatever was to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Their Coach &s;topped ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to an itinerant Stage, where a Genius, who com|pri&s;ed, within his &s;ingle Per&s;on, the two important Functions of a Tumbler and Merry-Andrew, by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Action and Oratory, extorted Plaudits and Huz|zas from all the Spectators.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, a Countryman, who rode upon a Mule, &s;at gaping and grin|ning, by Intervals, in all the extatic Rap|ture that can be a&s;cribed to Enthu&s;ia&s;m. While his Attention was thus rivetted, two knavi&s;h Wags came, and, ungirthing his Saddle, &s;upported it on either hand, till a Third of the Fraternity led his Mule away from under him, and a Fourth came with a three legged Hor&s;e, &s;uch as Hou&s;wives dry their Linnen on, and, having jamm'd it under the Saddle, they all retreated in Peace.</P>
<P>The Populace were &s;o delighted at this humorous Act of Felony, that, in&s;tead of interrupting it, it only &s;erved to redouble their Joys and Clamours. <HI>Harry,</HI> too, greatly chuckled and laughed at the Joke. But, when he &s;aw the Bea&s;t led off, and
<PB N="231" REF="232">that the amazed Proprietor, on &s;tooping to take the Bridle, had fallen precipitately to the Ground, his Heart twitched him with a Kind of Compunction, and, throwing him&s;elf out at the Coach Window, he made all the Speed that the Pre&s;s would ad|mit, and, recovering the Mule, brought it back to its Owner.</P>
<P>Here, Friend, &s;aid he, here is your Bea&s;t again, take Care the next time that they don't &s;teal your Teeth. Thank you, Ma&s;ter, &s;aid the Clown, &s;ince you have been &s;o hone&s;t as to give him to me back, I will never be the One to bring you to Sizes or Se&s;&s;ions. I am much obliged to your Clemency, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> but pray let me have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you &s;afe mounted. So &s;aying he held the Stirrup, while the Booby got up and &s;aid, Well, my Lad, very well, if we happen to meet at <HI>Croydon,</HI> we may take a Pot together.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> beheld and contemplated this whole Scene with all the cordial Gratificati|ons that the Heart of Man could &s;eel; and langhing, as his Favourite entered the Coach, my hone&s;t Friend, &s;aid he, your Officiou&s;ne&s;s might have brought us All in|to a Scrape; for, had you been given in Charge to the Con&s;table, you would pro|bably have applied to your Companions for Bail. I don't think, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Clement,</HI> that
<PB N="232" REF="233">the Action would have been bailable, nei|ther could we deny that we &s;aw the &s;tolen Bea&s;t in his Cu&s;tody. In Truth, Gentle|men, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> I partly begin to be of Mr. <HI>Veer</HI>'s Opinion, that the Pea&s;antry of <HI>England</HI> are the mo&s;t boori&s;h and in&s;en&s;ible of all the human Species.</P>
<P>In the Evening, they adjourn'd from Coffee to David's Harp in <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> in or|der to hear <HI>Marmulet</HI> the famed <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Mu&s;ician, who performed on the P&s;altery, the Viol d'Amor, and other In&s;truments not known till then in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>They took Mr. <HI>James</HI> with them, to par|take of the Entertainment, and were &s;hewn to a large Room, where Each pay'd Half a Crown at the Door.</P>
<P>The Room was divided into a Number of Boxes, where each Company &s;at apart, while they were jointly gratified and charm|ed by the inimitable Execution of the Mu|&s;ician.</P>
<P>A Fla&s;k of Burgundy was &s;et before Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and his Friends, while Mr. <HI>Hardy</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hilton,</HI> who &s;at in the next Box, were regaling them&s;elves with a Fla&s;k of Ro&s;a Solis.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="234">
All was Silence and Attention till there was a Pau&s;e in the Performance. Then, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Hardy,</HI> do you know, <HI>Jack,</HI> that the Earl of <HI>Albemarle</HI> is to have a Ma&s;que on <HI>Monday</HI> Night? I am &s;orry to hear it, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Hilton,</HI> as I am obliged to be out of Town. I may happen to &s;ave &s;ome|thing by that, &s;aid <HI>Hardy,</HI> you mu&s;t lend me your Domino. Indeed, I cannot, it was torn to Fritters in a Scuffle as I came out from the la&s;t Ma&s;querade. Lend me your Ma&s;que then. That, too, was lo&s;t at the &s;ame time, but what occa&s;ion can you have for a Ma&s;que, <HI>Hardy?</HI> I am &s;ure no One will take that for a natural Face. Mine is the Face of <HI>Mars, Hilton,</HI> yours that of <HI>Adonis,</HI> with which no Modern <HI>Venus</HI> will ever be &s;initten, I promi&s;e you. I will engage to outrival an Army of &s;uch Jackanapes in an A&s;&s;ault on the Fair. If Impudence may compen&s;ate for the Want of other Artillery, I believe you may do Wonders, <HI>Hardy.</HI> And it does compen|&s;ate, my Friend. Women, take my Word and Experience for it, love nothing of their own Re&s;emblance, except in the Gla&s;s. They dete&s;t any thing that looks like an Ambiguity in the Sex. While what you are plea&s;ed to call Impudence, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;pares their Mode&s;ty, &s;aves them the Appearance of an Advance on their Part, and gives
<PB N="234" REF="235">them the Plea&s;ure of piquing them&s;elves on their extraordinary Virtue, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould happen to make a Defence. How|ever, &s;ince you have complimented me, on my A&s;&s;urance, I will put it to the Te&s;t on this Occa&s;ion; and go to his Excel|lency's Ball, without any other Vizard &s;ave this which Nature, in her great Bounty, hath be&s;towed.</P>
<P>When our Company were on the Return to their Lodgings, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fen|ton,</HI> would you not like to go to this Ma&s;|querade? Why, Sir, as I have not yet &s;een One, perhaps it might not be ami&s;s to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity for once in my Life. In Truth, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I wi&s;h they never had been introduced into this King|dom, as they are Inlets to Intrigue, and give Countenance to Licentiou&s;ne&s;s. How|ever, for once in your Life, as you &s;ay, you &s;hall be gratified, my <HI>Harry.</HI> Be plea&s;ed to tell me, Sir, are they very en|tertaining? They would be extremely di|verting, my Dear, if People acted up to the Characters that they pretend to repre&s;ent. But, on the contrary, they have Sailors who don't know a Point in the Compa&s;s or the Name of a Rope in the Ship. Shep|herds and Shepherde&s;&s;es who never eloped from the cockney Dialect of the City. In|dian Queens who can &s;ay nothing as to their
<PB N="235" REF="236">Subjects or their Sovereignty. Gods and Godde&s;&s;es totally ignorant of their own Hi&s;|tory in the Mythology. And <HI>Italian</HI> Car|dinals who will &s;wear you in the Phra&s;e of a <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Foxhunter.</P>
<P>But, what &s;hall we do for Tickets, <HI>Har|ry?</HI> I don't care to apply to my Friends, for Fear of di&s;covering that we are in Town. O Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>James,</HI> I am acquainted with his Excellency's Major Domo, and can procure you as many Tickets as You plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf, for the pre&s;ent, the Appointment of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Cha|racter and Dre&s;s. As the Plainne&s;s of your Garb has hitherto, &s;aid he, been a Ma&s;que and Di&s;gui&s;e to your internal Ornaments; the Brilliancy of your Dre&s;s &s;hall now, on the other Hand, di&s;gui&s;e and conceal the Simplicity of your Manners.</P>
<P>About two Hours before the Opening of the Ball, <HI>Harry</HI> wrapped him&s;elf in a Cloak of black Bays, and &s;tepped into a hackney Coach with Mr. <HI>James,</HI> who had promi&s;ed to introduce him to his Friend Mr. <HI>Dominic,</HI> in order for him to reconnoitre the &s;everal Scenes of Operation before the Action began.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="237">
The Major Domo received <HI>Harry</HI> with the utmo&s;t Complacence; for he held his Ma&s;que in his Hand, and the Loveline&s;s of his A&s;pect &s;hone with peculiar Lu&s;tre through the Blackne&s;s of his Attire.</P>
<P>After &s;urveying &s;everal Apartments, they pa&s;&s;ed through the long Room and entered, by an arched Gateway, into a Kind of Saloon, at the upper End of which was a Pede&s;tal of about five Feet in height, whereon a celebrated Statue of the <HI>Hercules Farne&s;e</HI> had formerly &s;tood.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> eyed it attentively and, conceiving a &s;udden Frolic, he in&s;tantly ca&s;t away his Cloak, clapped on his Ma&s;k and winged Helmet, gra&s;ped his Caduceus with his Right, and, laying his Left on the Top of the Pede&s;tal, &s;prung lightly up; and threw him&s;elf into that Attitude, to which the Statuaries have formed their <HI>Mercury,</HI> when ju&s;t prepared for flight.</P>
<P>His Headpiece was of thinly plated but poli&s;hed Gold, buckled together at the joining by four burning Carbuncles. His Jacket was of Genoa Silk, died in Ultra Marine, exceeding the Tint of an Egyptian Sky. It was braced clo&s;e to his Body with Emerald Cla&s;ps, that &s;hewed the Fine&s;s of his Proportion to inimitable Advantage, and
<PB N="237" REF="238">over the Whole, in cele&s;tial Confu&s;ion, were &s;own Stars, of different Magnitudes, All powdered with Diamonds.</P>
<P>The Moment that <HI>Harry</HI> ca&s;t him&s;elf into his Po&s;ture, Mr. <HI>Dominic</HI> &s;tarted back &s;even or eight Paces, and, rai&s;ing his Hands, with &s;tareing Eyes, and a Mouth of open Amazement, at length he exclaimed; Stay a little, my dear &s;weet Ma&s;ter! do now, do but &s;tay ju&s;t as you are for a Minute, and you will oblige me pa&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion, I will be your Own for ever.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he turned off, and running to an adjacent Apartment, where their Maje&s;|ties, with the Prince&s;s of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the Prince&s;s of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and the Chief of the Court were gathered; he told his Ma&s;ter aloud, that he had the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity to &s;hew him that human Eye ever beheld.</P>
<P>All ro&s;e with Precipitation, and crowded after the Earl and the royal Pair, as clo&s;e as Decency would admit, till they came to the Saloon and beheld, with A&s;toni&s;hment, the Per&s;on, Shape, Attitude, and Attire of our Hero.</P>
<P>Some doubted, but Mo&s;t believed that he was a real Statute, placed there by his Excellency on Purpo&s;e for a Surpri&s;e. Sir
<PB N="238" REF="239"><HI>Fielding,</HI> who was the acknowledged Con|noi&s;&s;eur of the Age, and was, in Fact, what the People of ta&s;te call an <HI>elegans For|marum Spectator,</HI> exclaimed with &s;ome Vehemency, Never, never, did I behold &s;uch Beauty of Symmetry, &s;uch Roundings of Angles; where, where, my Lord, could you get this ine&s;timable Acqui&s;ition? O|thers cryed, <HI>Phidias, Phidias</HI> never execut|ed the like; all the Works of <HI>Praxiteles</HI> were nothing to it!</P>
<P>The Earl, however, was well appri&s;ed of the Deception, and knew that our <HI>Mer|eury</HI> was no Part of his Property.&mdash;Son of <HI>Maia,</HI> &s;aid he aloud, what Tidings from Heaven?&mdash;A Me&s;&s;age, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> from my Father <HI>Jupiter</HI> to their Maje&s;ties&mdash;And pray, what may your Errand in|tend?&mdash;Matters of highe&s;t Importance; that they are the favourite Repre&s;entatives of my Father upon Earth. And that, while their Maje&s;ties continue the Monarch of a free and willing People, they are grea|ter than if they were Regents of a Univer&s;e of Slaves.&mdash;All buzzed their Applau&s;e and Admiration.&mdash;It mu&s;t be he, whi&s;|pered the King&mdash;it can be no Other, cried the Queen&mdash;<HI>Albemarle,</HI> whi&s;pered his Maje&s;ty, we have marked this Youth for our Own; keep your Eye upon him, and do your be&s;t Endeavours to engage and bind him to us.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="240">
In the mean time, <HI>Harry,</HI> on delivering his cele&s;tial Me&s;&s;age, flew like a Feather from his Po&s;t, and ca&s;ting his Cloak about him, vani&s;hed into an adjoining Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>The Company now began to gather fa&s;t, and <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;tealing from his Retreat, kept his Cloud about his Sky, and mingled in the Crowd. Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> had accom|panied Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> in Dominos. They &s;oon di&s;covered <HI>Harry,</HI> and were highly diverted by the Account which he gave them of his Metamorpho&s;is into a Statue.</P>
<P>While the A&s;&s;embly was dividing into Pairs and chatty Parties, a Phenomenon entered that drew all their Attention. The Honourable Major <HI>Gromley,</HI> the lu&s;tie&s;t and fatte&s;t young Man in the Kingdom, advanced without a Ma&s;que, in Petticoats, a &s;lobbering Bib and Apron. He carried a large Round of Bread and Butter in one Hand, while Lady <HI>Bet&s;y M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">nit,</HI> an elderly Mi&s;s of about three Feet high, held his Leading Strings with her Left and, in her Right, brandi&s;hed a Birch Rod of length|ened Authority. His Governante pre&s;&s;ed him forward and &s;eemed to threaten Cha&s;|ti&s;ement for his Delay; while the jolly, broad, fooli&s;h, humourous, half laughing, half crying, Baby Face of the Major ex|torted
<PB N="240" REF="241">Peals of Laughter from All who were pre&s;ent. And this is &s;ufficient to con|vince us that the Performers of the ancient Drama could not po&s;&s;ibly, in Ma&s;ks, ex|cite the Pa&s;&s;ions of Nature. No Excellence of Voice or Ge&s;ture, of Action or Empha&s;is, could compen&s;ate for the Exclu&s;ion of the immediate Interpreters of the Soul, the living Speech of the Eye, and varied Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the Countenance.</P>
<P>After the Major had lei&s;urely traver&s;ed the full length of the Room, and inimitably executed the Whole of his Part, he retir|ed to undre&s;s and a&s;&s;ume a new Appear|ance.</P>
<P>Mean while, two Females entered in very unu&s;al Habits. The Fir&s;t was dre&s;&s;ed in a choice Collection of old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Ballads, from Chevy Cha&s;e and the Fragment of Hardy <HI>Canute,</HI> down to <HI>Bar|bara Allen</HI> and the Babes in the Wood. The Other was all hung from Top to Bottom with Looking-gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Immediately the Crowd gathered about them. All, who were fond of their own Hi&s;tory, preferable to that of Others, pay'd their Homage, in a circling Throng, to the Queen of the Looking-gla&s;&s;es. While the Few who preferred In&s;truction were intent in peru&s;ing the Fair who was covered with
<PB N="241" REF="242">Knowledge. But, the Lady of the Mir|rors did not long retain her Votaries; her Gla&s;&s;es were all Emblems of her own Di&s;|po&s;ition, they were the Gla&s;&s;es of Scandal and Calumny, and repre&s;ented the human Species in the mo&s;t di&s;torted View; Some lengthened and Some widened their Objects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Mea&s;ure, while Others wholly in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters"> and turned them top&s;y turvy. All <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> away in Di&s;gu&s;t from &s;uch Pro&s;pects or their own Per&s;ons, and the reflecting Lady was ju&s;tly le&s;t to glitter apart from Society.</P>
<P>The next who entered was a <HI>Goliah,</HI> all &s;heathed in compleat Steel. He advanced with &s;low and maje&s;tic Steps to the Side|board, and a&s;king for a Fla&s;k of Champain, turned it down without taking it once from his Head. He then demanded Another, and Another, and &s;o on, till the Providore, who had looked and longed in vain to &s;ee him drop, ran pannic-&s;truck to his Ma&s;ter, and, in a half Whi&s;per, &s;aid, my Lord, your Cel|lars will &s;carcely &s;uffice to quench the Thir&s;t of one Man here, he has already turned down fifteen Fla&s;ks of Champain, and &s;till is un&s;atisfied and calls for more. Then give him fifteen Hog&s;heads, replied the Earl laughing, and if that will not an&s;wer, &s;end out for another Set.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243">
In the mean time, the mailed Champion had withdrawn from the Sideboard, and, with a large drinking Gla&s;s in his Hand, advanced till he got into the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly. He then turned a little In&s;tru|ment that was fixed in a certain Part of his double ca&s;ed Armour, and, filling the Gla&s;s to the Brim, he uncla&s;ped the lower Part of his Bever, and acco&s;ting a <HI>Peruvian</HI> Prin|ce&s;s who &s;tood ju&s;t oppo&s;ite, permit me the Honour, Madam, &s;ays he, of drink|ing your Highne&s;s's Health. So &s;aying, the Liquor was out of Sight in a Twink|ling. Will your Royal Highne&s;s, conti|nued he, be plea&s;ed to try how you reli&s;h our European Wines? I am obliged to you, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I am actually athir&s;t; then, rai&s;ing her Ma&s;k below, &s;he pledged him to the Bottom. Her Companion, a &s;hin|ing <HI>Arcadian,</HI> advanced and reque&s;ted the &s;ame Favour. Then Another, and ano|ther Lady, and &s;everal Others in Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, All of whom he graciou&s;ly grati|fied, till he was nearly exhau&s;ted. Some of the Men then pre&s;&s;ed to him, and en|treated for a Gla&s;s; no, no, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, go and be &s;erved el&s;ewhere, I am a Merchant for Ladies alone, I import no Liquors for vile male Animals.</P>
<P>Our former Acquaintance, Mr. <HI>Hardy,</HI> had adventured according to Promi&s;e with|out
<PB N="243" REF="244">a Ma&s;que. After looking about a while for &s;ome Object of his Gallantry, he fixed upon a Lady of a very elegant Shape and &s;prightly Appearance.</P>
<P>When they had bandied, between them, &s;ome occa&s;ional Chat, of more Smartne&s;s than Humour, and more Wit than Mean|ing, He called for a favourite Air and led the Fair One a Minuet, in which they Both performed <HI>a&s;&s;ez bien.</HI></P>
<P>He now began to grow more warm in his Addre&s;&s;es. If your Face, Madam, &s;aid he, &s;hould happen to be an&s;werable to the Enchantments of your Form, and the Syren in your Voice, I be&s;eech you to keep that Ma&s;k on for ever, the Safety of Mankind is intere&s;ted in my Reque&s;t. But &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, that my Face &s;hould happen to prove an Antidote to the Danger of my other Charms? then, Madam, let me &s;ee it by all Means, and make ha&s;te, I pray you before I am pa&s;t Remedy. I &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, tittering, I &s;ee that you are already more than half a dying Man; poor Wretch, I pity you, and have taken it in|to my Head to &s;lay you outright, in order to put you out of Pain.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he drew her Ma&s;k on one Side, and &s;hewed him, indeed, a very lovely Countenance. But while his Flood of com|plimentary
<PB N="244" REF="245">Eloquence was ju&s;t upon break|ing forth, hu&s;h, Sir, cried the Lady, I will not hear a Syllable, till you fir&s;t return the Compliment that I have pay'd you, and let me &s;ee what you have got under that Vizard of yours. Here <HI>Hardy,</HI> in &s;pite of Impudence, &s;tood mute with A&s;toni&s;hment. The Lady bur&s;t into a Laugh; the Joke was caught and &s;pread like wild Fire; the Laugh grew univer&s;al; all Eyes were on poor <HI>Hardy,</HI> and a hundred Tongues cried, at once, your Ma&s;que, Sir, your Ma&s;que, take off your Ma&s;que for the Lady! This was &s;omething more than human A&s;&s;u|rance could &s;tand. <HI>Hardy</HI> retired with pre|cipitate Confu&s;ion; and ju&s;tly &s;uffered for the Pre&s;umption of his boa&s;ted Facility of Conque&s;ts over the Fair.</P>
<P>Our Hero had hitherto kept him&s;elf con|cealed, being &s;ecretly a&s;hamed of the Lu&s;|tre of his Apparel; but, at Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s de&s;ire he laid his Cloak a&s;ide, and, in&s;tant|ly, all the Eyes of the A&s;&s;embly were upon him. In order to avoid their Gaze, he ad|vanced into the Throng, where a Parcel of circling Females a&s;ked him a Number of in&s;ignificant Que&s;tions, to which he return|ed, in Kind, An&s;wers pretty nearly as in|&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>At length a <HI>Diana</HI> approached, who&s;e Diamond Cre&s;cent was of the Value of a
<PB N="245" REF="246">princely Ran&s;om. She took him carele&s;ly by the Hand, and &s;aid, come, Brother <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> let us give the&s;e Mortals a Sample of what we Coele&s;tials can perform. Lead where you plea&s;e, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> I cannot mi&s;s my Way while I tread in the Light of &s;o fair a Moon.</P>
<P>The Lady called to the Orche&s;tre for a Saraband, and All made ample Room, attentive to the Motions of the &s;hining Pair.</P>
<P>The Dance began, and the Spectators in a Manner &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their Breathing for fear of giving or receiving the &s;malle&s;t In|terruption. The Performers &s;tepped Mu|&s;ic, their Action was Grace, and they &s;eemed with Difficulty retained to the Floor over which they moved. They ended, and the A&s;&s;embly was &s;till mute with A&s;toni&s;h|ment, till they broke out into a general Murmur of Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mercury,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Diana,</HI> the Story of <HI>Argus</HI> tells us that you were formerly ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;et Folk to &s;leep; but, for the pre&s;ent, you have opened all Eyes to Ob|&s;ervation. Ah, Madam, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> could I have gue&s;&s;ed at the Moon that was to &s;hine this Night, I &s;hould have a&s;&s;umed a very different Character. What Charac|ter,
<PB N="246" REF="247">I pray you? that of <HI>Endymion,</HI> Madam. I wi&s;h, &s;he whi&s;pered, that You were a Prince, or that I were a Pea&s;ant, and &s;o &s;aying, &s;he turned from him and mixed in the Crowd.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> was next addre&s;&s;ed by a Shepher|de&s;s, and again by a Nun. But, he de|clined, as honourably as he could, to tend the Flock of the One; or to be the Cau&s;e of any Breach of Vows in the Other, ob|&s;erving to her, that &s;he had already taken the Veil. The Boy's a FOOL, &s;aid &s;he; I know, &s;aid <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>A Gip&s;y then acco&s;ted, and taking him by the Hand, will you be plea&s;ed, Sir, to be told your Fortune, &s;aid &s;he? By no Means, my &s;weet voiced <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> an&s;wer|ed <HI>Harry,</HI> I would avoid, above all things, prying into Futurity. Knowledge, Sir, is &s;urely de&s;irable, and above all Foreknow|ledge. Not &s;o, &s;aid <HI>Harry;</HI> Foreknowledge of Evil would but double the Mi&s;ery; and Foreknowledge of Good would deprive me of Hope by Certainty, and Hope is a Ble&s;&s;|ing, perhaps, preferable to Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Tell me, Sir, and tell me truely, did you ever yet &s;ee the Girl that you could like? Yes, Madam, two or three, for whom I have conceived a very tender Friend&s;hip, but no One yet for whom I have conceived a Pa&s;|&s;ion. Ah then, Mr. <HI>Mercury,</HI> &s;aid the gen|tle
<PB N="247" REF="248">Prophete&s;s, I have only to de&s;ire the la&s;t Ca&s;t of your Office; when I am dead, be &s;o grateful as to waft my friendly Spi|rit to the Shades of <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> there to join <HI>Dido</HI> and other unfortunate Lovers.</P>
<P>So &s;aying She turned and retired, with a Sigh, that entered, and &s;unk into the Heart of our Hero.</P>
<P>The Company now began to depart, when the Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> coming up to <HI>Harry,</HI> took him a little apart, and, throw|ing his Arm over his Shoulder, pre&s;&s;ed him to him and &s;aid, my dear Fellow, you have done me &s;ignal Honour this Night; pray double the Favour to me, by letting me &s;ee you again &s;peedily and as often as you can. For the pre&s;ent, you mu&s;t not go till their Maje&s;ties have &s;poke with You. Not to Night, &s;o plea&s;e your Ex|cellency, an&s;wered <HI>Harry;</HI> at all other Times, I &s;hall be ready to attend and &s;erve their Maje&s;ties, without any Ma&s;que.</P>
<P>The next Morning, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was much &s;urpri&s;ed by a Vi&s;it from the great Man; Mr. <HI>Dominic</HI> had appri&s;ed his Ma&s;|ter where he was to be found. During Breakfa&s;t, the Earl pre&s;&s;ed eagerly for <HI>Har|ry</HI>'s Attendance at Court, and promi&s;ed every Advantage and Honour that the Crown could be&s;tow. You mu&s;t pardon
<PB N="248" REF="249">me, my Lord, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI> I am will|ing to advance to You two hundred thou|&s;and Pounds more, toward his Maje&s;ties pre&s;ent Expedition again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> whom I look upon to be our natural and &s;alutary Enemies. They are as <HI>Carthage</HI> was to <HI>Rome,</HI> they hold us in Exerci&s;e, and keep a quarrel&s;ome People from falling out among them&s;elves. Indeed, my Lord, I am de&s;irous of gratifying my royal Ma&s;ter with any Thing except the Sacrifice of my Child. I cannot part with him till his E|ducation is compleated; and then, if he an&s;wers my Expectations, I doubt I may be more unwilling to part with him than ever.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon our Company went again to the Tower, to &s;ee as well as to hear the recent Story of the great Lion and the little Dog.</P>
<P>They found the Place thronged, and All were obliged to pay treble Prices, on Account of the unprecedented Novelty of the Shew; &s;o that the Keeper, in a &s;hort Space, acquired a little Fortune.</P>
<P>The great Cage in the Front was occu|pied by a Bea&s;t who, by Way of preemi|nence, was called the King's Lion; and, while he traver&s;ed the Limits of his &s;trait|ened
<PB N="249" REF="250">Dominions, he was attended by a &s;mall and very beautiful black Spaniel, who fri&s;ked and gambolled about him, and, at Times, would pretend to &s;narl, and bite at him; and again the noble Ani|mal, with an Air of fond Complacence, would hold down his Head, while the lit|tle Creature licked his formidable Chops. Their Hi&s;tory, as the Keeper related, was this:</P>
<P>It was cu&s;tomary for All, who were un|able or unwilling to pay their Sixpence, to bring a Dog or Cat as an Oblation to the Bea&s;ts in lieu of Money to the Keeper. Among Others, a Fellow had caught up this pretty black Spaniel in the Streets, and he was accordingly thrown into the Cage of the great Lion. Immediately the little Animal trembled and &s;hivered, and crouched and threw it&s;elf on its Back, and put forth its Tongue, and held up its Paws, in &s;upplicatory Attitudes, as an Ac|knowledgment of &s;uperior Power and pray|ing for Mercy. In the mean Time the lordly Brute, in&s;tead of devouring it, be|held it with an Eye of philo&s;ophic In&s;pec|tion. He turned it over with one Paw, and then turned it with the Other; and &s;melled to it, and &s;eemed de&s;irous of courting a further Acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="251">
The Keeper, on &s;eeing this, brought a large Me&s;s of his own Family-Dinner; but the Lion kept aloof and refu&s;ed to eat, keeping his Eye on the Dog, and inviting him as it were to be his Ta&s;ter. At length, the little Animal's Fears being &s;omething abated, and his Appetite quickened by the Smell of the Victuals, he approached flow|ly, and, with trembling, ventured to eat. The Lion then advanced gently, and be|gan to partake, and they fini&s;hed their Meal very lovingly together.</P>
<P>From this Day the &s;tricte&s;t Friend&s;hip commenced between them, a Friend&s;hip con&s;i&s;ting of all po&s;&s;ible Affection and Ten|derne&s;s on the Part of the Lion, and of the utmo&s;t Confidence and Boldne&s;s on the Part of the Dog; in&s;omuch that he would lay him&s;elf down to &s;leep, within the Fangs and under the Jaws of his terrible Patron.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, who had lo&s;t the Spa|niel, and had adverti&s;ed a Reward of two Guineas to the Finder, at length heared of the Adventure, and went to reclaim his Dog. You &s;ee, Sir, &s;aid the Keeper, it would be a great Pity to part &s;uch loving Friends. However, if you in&s;i&s;t upon your Property, you mu&s;t even be plea&s;ed to take him your&s;elf; it is a Ta&s;k that I
<PB N="251" REF="252">would not engage in for five hundred Gui|neas. The Gentleman ro&s;e into great Wrath, but finally cho&s;e to acquie&s;ce, ra|ther than have a per&s;onal Di&s;pute with the Lion.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the two Friends eat together, he &s;ent for twen|ty Pounds of boiled Beef, which was ac|cordingly cut in Pieces and given into the Cage; when, immediately, the little Brute, who&s;e Appetite happened to be eager art the time, was de&s;irous of making a Mo|nopoly of the whole, and putting his Paws upon the Meat, and grumbling and bark|ing, he audaciou&s;ly flew in the Face of the Lion. But the generous Creature, in&s;tead of being offended by his impotent Compa|nion, &s;tarted back and &s;eemed terrified at the Fury of his Attack, neither attempted to eat a Bit, till his Favourite had tacitly given Permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When they were Both gorged, the Lion &s;tretched and turned him&s;elf and lay down in an evident Po&s;ture for Repo&s;e, but this his &s;portive Companion would not admit. He fri&s;ked and gamboled about him, bark|ed at him, would now &s;crape and tear at his Head with his Claws, and again &s;eize him by the Ear, and bite and pull away; while the noble Bea&s;t appeared affected by no
<PB N="252" REF="253">other Sentiment &s;ave that of Plea&s;ure and Complacence.</P>
<P>But, let us proceed to the tragic Cata&s;|trophe of this extraordinary Story; a Sto|ry &s;till known to Many, as delivered down by Tradition from Father to Son.</P>
<P>In about twelve Months, the little Spaniel &s;ickened and died, and left his loving Patron the mo&s;t de&s;olate of Creatures. For a time, the Lion did not appear to conceive otherwi&s;e than that his Favourite was a&s;leep. He would continue to &s;mell to him, and then would &s;tir him with his No&s;e, and turn him over with his Paw; but, finding that all his Efforts to awake him were vain, he would traver&s;e his Cage from End to End at a &s;wift and un|ea&s;y Pace, then &s;top, and look down upon him with a fixed and drooping Regard; and again lift his Head on high, and open his horrible Throat, and prolong a Roar, as of di&s;tant Thunder, for &s;everal Minutes together.</P>
<P>They attempted, but in vain, to convey the Carca&s;e from him, he watched it per|petually, and would &s;uffer nothing to touch it. The Keeper then endeavoured to tempt him with a Variety of Victuals, but he turned from all that was offered with loathing. They then put &s;everal living
<PB N="253" REF="254">Dogs into his Cage, and the&s;e he in&s;tantly tore piecemeal, but left their Members on the Floor. His Pa&s;&s;ions being thus in|flamed, he would dart his Fangs into the Boards and pluck away large Splinters, and again grapple at the Bars of his Cage, and &s;eem enraged at his Re&s;traint from tearing the World to Pieces.</P>
<P>Again, as quite &s;pent, he would &s;tretch him&s;elf by the Remains of his beloved A&s;&s;ociate, and gather him in with his Paws, and put him to his Bo&s;om; and then utter under Roars of &s;uch a terrible Melancholy, as &s;eemed to threaten All around, for the Lo&s;s of his little Playfellow, the only Friend, the only Companion that he had upon Earth.</P>
<P>For five Days he thus langui&s;hed, and gradually declined, without taking any Su&s;|tenance, or admitting any Comfort; till one Morning, he was found dead, with his Head lovingly reclined on the Carca&s;e of his little Friend. They were Both in|terred together, and their Grave plentifully watered by the Tears of the Keeper and his loudly lamenting Family.&mdash;But, to return.</P>
<P>When our Company were on their Way from the Tower to their Lodgings, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> what we have ju&s;t &s;een re|minds
<PB N="254" REF="255">me of the Opinion of my Friend <HI>Peter Patience,</HI> that One who is fearle&s;s cannot be provoked. You &s;aw how that little tea&s;ing, petulant Wretch had the In|&s;olence to fly in the Face of his Benefactor, without offending or exciting in him any Kind of Re&s;entment. True, <HI>Harry,</HI> for the Lion was &s;en&s;ible that his te&s;ty Compa|nion was little, and impotent, and depend|ed upon him, and had Confidence in his Clemency, and therefore he loved him with all his Faults. Anger, however, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, is not only allowable but be|comes a Duty. The Scripture &s;ays, <HI>be angry but &s;in not.</HI> We ought to feel and fear for Others; and Lu&s;t, Violence, and Oppre&s;&s;ion of every Sort, will excite the Indignation of a generous and benevolent Per&s;on, though he may not fear for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>After Supper, <HI>Harry</HI> appeared to rumi|nate, and &s;aid, How comes it, Sir, that Creatures, not indued with Rea&s;on or Con|&s;cience, &s;hall yet, in the Affections that are peculiarly called humane, exceed even mo&s;t of the human Species? You have &s;een that it was the Ca&s;e between the Lion and little Dog.</P>
<P>It was the Opinion, my <HI>Harry,</HI> of an an|cient Philo&s;opher, that God was the Soul and Spirit of Brutes; and this he judged
<PB N="255" REF="256">from ob&s;erving that what we call In&s;tinct, was incomparably wi&s;er, more &s;agacious, and more accompli&s;hed for attaining its Ends, throughout its Sphere of Action, than the mo&s;t perfect human Rea&s;on. Now, had this Philo&s;opher, in&s;tead of &s;ay|ing that God was the Soul of Brutes, bare|ly alledged that he ruled and dictated within them, he would not have gone a Tittle wide of the Truth.</P>
<P>God indeed is, him&s;elf, the Beauty and the Benefit of all his Works. As they cannot exi&s;t but in him and by him, &s;o his Impre&s;&s;ion is upon them, and his Impregna|tion is through them.</P>
<P>Though the Elements, and all that we know of Nature and Creature, have a Mix|ture of natural and phy&s;ical Evil; God is, however, throughout, an internal, though often, a hidden Principal of Good, and never wholly departs from his Right of Do|minion and Operation in his Creatures: But is, and is alone, the Beauty and Bene|ficence, the whole Glory and Graciou&s;ne&s;s that can po&s;&s;ibly be in them.</P>
<P>As the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>the invi&s;ible Things of God are made manife&s;t and vi&s;ible by the Things that are &s;een.</HI> He is the &s;ecret and central Light that kindles up the Sun, his dazzling Repre&s;entative; and he lives, en|lightens,
<PB N="256" REF="257">and comforts in the Diffu&s;ion of his Beams.</P>
<P>His Spirit in&s;pires and actuates the Air; and is, in it, a Breath of Life to all his Creatures. He blooms in the Blo&s;&s;om, and unfolds in the Ro&s;e. He is Fragrance in Flowers, and Flavour in Fruits. He holds Infinitude within a Speck, and opens his World of Wonders in the Minims of Na|ture. He is the Virtue of every Heart that is &s;oftened by a Sen&s;e of Pity or Touch of Benevolence. He coos in the Turtle, and bleats in the Lamb; and, through the Paps of the &s;tern Bear and implacable Tygre&s;s, he yields forth the Milk of loving Kindne&s;s to their little Ones. Even, my <HI>Harry,</HI> when we hear the delicious Enchantment of Mu&s;ic; it is but an external Sketch, a di&s;tant and faint Echo of tho&s;e &s;entimen|tal and rapturous Tuneings that ri&s;e up, throughout the Immen&s;ity of our God, from Eternity to Eternity.</P>
<P>Thus all Things are &s;ecretly pregnant with their God. And the Lover of Sin|ners, the univer&s;al Redeemer, is a Princi|ple of Good within them, that contends with the Malignity of their lap&s;ed State. And thus, as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <HI>all Na|ture is in Travail and groaneth to be delivered from the Evil.</HI> 'Till the Breath of the Love of God &s;hall kindle up the final Fire, out
<PB N="257" REF="258">of which the new Heavens and new Earth &s;hall come forth, as Gold &s;even times re|fined, to &s;hine for ever and ever!</P>
<P>HARRY, agreeable to his Covenant with Signor <HI>Volanti,</HI> had penned the following Adverti&s;ement, and in&s;erted it in all the public Papers, to wit.&mdash;<Q>On <HI>Saturday</HI> next, between the Hours of Ten and Twelve in the Forenoon, the celebrated <HI>Dominico Jachimo Tonino Volanti</HI> will take his Flight from the Spire of <HI>Cle|ment</HI>'s Steeple, and alight, at the Di&s;|tance of two Bows &s;hot, on the <HI>Strand,</HI> and this he will perform before the Eyes of all People.</Q></P>
<P>On the impatiently expected Morning, <HI>Harry</HI> took Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> with him in a hack Chai&s;e, and found an innumerable Con|cour&s;e, as well of the Gentry in their Coaches, as of the Populace on Foot. <HI>London</HI> had poured forth its Numbers to behold this a&s;toni&s;hing Flight. The Win|dows were all Eyes on every Side, and the Hou&s;e Tops were hung with Clu&s;ters of People as of Bees.</P>
<P>After <HI>Harry</HI> had &s;urveyed the Crowd, with inward Titillation, he whi&s;pered to <HI>Clement</HI> and &s;aid, You &s;hall &s;ee now, what a &s;udden Di&s;comfiture I will make of this huge Army.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259">
He then put forth his Head, and &s;aid to All around, Don't Ye yet perceive, my Friends, what Fools we are all made, don't ye remember that this is the <HI>Fir&s;t of April?</HI></P>
<P>He had &s;carce &s;poke the Words, when they &s;pread from Man to Man, and &s;oon were muttered throughout the A&s;&s;embly. And then louder, and more loud, the <HI>Fir&s;t of April,</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t of April,</HI> was re|peated all about.</P>
<P>The Company now began to be in Mo|tion. All Heads were in&s;tantly withdrawn from the late thronged Windows, and the Hou&s;e Tops began to be cleared with a &s;hameful Caution.</P>
<P>Immediately was hear'd the rolling of many Wheels, and the La&s;hing of many Whips, while every Coachman pre&s;&s;ed through the Crowd, impatient to deliver his honourable Freight from the public Shame. But the Populace, now, began to reli&s;h a Joke that was &s;o much again&s;t their Betters; and, in Peals of Laughter, and united Shouts of Triumph, they echoed and reechoed after them, <HI>April Fools! April Fools!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="260">
Among Others, Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> had come with his Friend <HI>Rakely,</HI> in an elevated Phaeton, of which his Lord&s;hip was Cha|rioteer. As they happened to bru&s;h clo&s;e by <HI>Harry</HI>'s Carriage, &s;wearing, and puf|fing, and la&s;hing, and cur&s;ing at the Crowd, <HI>Harry</HI> cried to his old Enemy, you need not be in &s;o violent a Hurry, my Lord, perhaps you are not &s;o great a Foot as you imagine.</P>
<P>The Fools of Fa&s;hion were &s;carce with|drawn, when a long and &s;trong Rope was let down from the Top of the Steeple, to which it was fa&s;tened at the upper End. A Man then, laying hold on it below, drag|ged it along through the Crowd, and braced it, at a great Di&s;tance, to an Iron Ring that was &s;tapled into a Po&s;t, purpo&s;ely &s;unk on a level with the Pavement. They then brought a large and well &s;tuffed Feather Bed, and fixed it under the Cord where it joined the Ring.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Volanti</HI> appeared on the Top of the Steeple, and bending cau|tiou&s;ly forward, and getting the Cord within an Iron Groove that was braced to his Bo&s;om, he pu&s;hed him&s;elf onward, and, with a kindling Rapidity, flew over the Heads of the &s;houting Multitude, poi&s;ing him&s;elf with expanded Legs and Arms, as
<PB N="260" REF="261">he pa&s;&s;ed, till he was landed, without Da|mage, on his yielding Receiver. And, in the very next Papers, <HI>Harry</HI> publi&s;hed the following Adverti&s;ement, to wit.</P>
<P><Q>Before the Fir&s;t of <HI>April</HI> next, Sig|nor <HI>Dominico Jachimo Tonino Volanti,</HI> by the Help of Canvas Wings, contrived for the Purpo&s;e, propo&s;es to fly over Sea, from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> and invites all his <HI>London</HI> Friends to come and &s;ee him &s;et out.</Q></P>
<P>On the Evening of the following <HI>Monday,</HI> our Company went to the King's Theatre, and Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> told Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> by the Way, how <HI>Harry</HI> had made double Fools of the Citizens, fir&s;t in bringing them to|gether, and then in &s;ending them away.</P>
<P>The Moor of <HI>Venice</HI> was the appointed Entertainment for the Night. Mr. <HI>Mont|fort</HI> was to perform the Part of <HI>Othello,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Montfort</HI> that of <HI>Emilia,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Brace|girdle,</HI> their young Ward, the Part of <HI>De&s;|demona.</HI></P>
<P>All was carried on to the Satisfaction of the Audience, till they were &s;omewhat advanced in the Fourth Act, when Lord <HI>Mohun</HI> (as <HI>Milton</HI> has it) flown with In&s;o|lence and Wine, entered and &s;eated him|&s;elf in one of the Stage-Boxes.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">
He gave his whole Attention and Ap|plau&s;e to the fair <HI>De&s;demona,</HI> and, as &s;oon as the Act was over, he &s;lipped behind the Scenes, and began to addre&s;s her in a Strain of licentious Gallantry. But, as Mi&s;s <HI>Brace|girdle</HI> an&s;wered him with a cold Kind of Di&s;dain, his Nobility was piqued, and, catching her about the Neck, he thru&s;t his Hand into her Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The Girl in&s;tantly &s;hrieked, and <HI>Mont|fort</HI> coming up, forbear, my Lord, &s;aid he, the young Gentlewoman is virtuous and of good Education, and &s;uch Treatment is unbe&s;eeming a Man of Honour. Virtue and Education among Actors and Actre&s;&s;es! exclaimed his Lord&s;hip, hence, vile Ple|beian, and know your Di&s;tance better. And, &s;o &s;aying, he proceeded to an Action of &s;till greater Indecency.</P>
<P>The unhappy <HI>Montfort</HI> then cried, I will not &s;uffer &s;uch U&s;age from any Man under the Crown; I am her Guardian, it is my Duty to protect her, and, at the &s;ame Time, he pu&s;hed away his Lord&s;hip with &s;ome Violence. A Blow, a Blow, cried <HI>Mohun,</HI> and from a Vagabond too, Wretch, take the in&s;tant Cha&s;ti&s;ement of your In&s;o|lence. Then &s;pringing back, he &s;uddenly plucked out his Sword, and ran the worthy
<PB N="262" REF="263"><HI>Montfort</HI> through the Body, who imme|diately dropped and expired on the Spot.</P>
<P>The Women in&s;tantly uttered Shriek after Shriek, and, falling on the Body, &s;ent forth repeated Cries of the bittere&s;t Lamen|tation. The Audience were then in an Uproar, and called aloud to know the Meaning of the Di&s;turbance: when an Ac|tor ha&s;tily advanced to the Front of the Stage, and, with wringing Hands, inform|ed them of what had happened.</P>
<P>Our Hero, thereupon, &s;tarted up, and putting one Hand between the Spikes, he vaulted high over them into the Stage, and, drawing out his Sword, he ran about, &s;earching for and enquiring after the Mur|derer; as did &s;ome other Gentlemen who ha&s;tened round for the Purpo&s;e. But Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> for the pre&s;ent, had made his E|&s;cape. And, though he was afterward indicted, the Great Ones contrived Means for qua&s;hing the Affair, and he was never brought to Trial.</P>
<P>The Blood of the Good <HI>Montfort,</HI> how|ever, was not long unattoned. Lord <HI>Mo|hun,</HI> &s;hortly after, fell by the Hand of the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> in a Duel behind <HI>Mon|tague</HI> Hou&s;e.</P>

<HI>Harry</HI> had now &s;een whatever <HI>London</HI> could exhibit of elegant, curious, or plea&s;|ing; and Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> judged it Time to hold up to him the melancholy Rever&s;e of this Picture, to &s;hew him the <HI>Hou&s;e of Mourn|ing</HI> the <HI>End of all Men;</HI> to &s;hew him the dreary Shades and frightful Pa&s;&s;ages of Mortality, which Humanity &s;hudders to think of, but through which human Na|ture, of Nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t go.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e, he took him to the GENERAL HOSPITAL, where Death open|ed all his Gates, and &s;hewed him&s;elf in all his Forms. But, the great Poet, on this Occa&s;ion, hath anticipated all De&s;cription.</P>

<P>While Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> led his Pupil, through groaning Galleries and the Chambers of Death and Di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>Harry</HI> let down the Leaf of his Hat, and drew it over his Eyes, to conceal his Emotions. All that Day he was &s;ilent, and his Countenance downca&s;t; and, at Night, he ha&s;tened to Bed, where he wept a large Tribute to the mournfully inevitable Condition of Man's mi&s;erable State upon Earth.</P>
<P>The next Day, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> took him to the Bethlehem Ho&s;pital for Idiots and Lu|natics. But when <HI>Harry</HI> beheld and con|templated Objects, &s;o &s;hocking to Thought, &s;o terrible to Sight; when he had contem|plated, I &s;ay, the Ruin above all Ruins, hu|man Intelligence and human Rea&s;on &s;o fearfully overthrown; where the Ideas of the Soul, though di&s;torted and mi&s;placed, are quick and all alive to Horror and Ago|ny; he grew &s;ick and turned pale, and, &s;uddenly catching his Uncle by the Arm, come, Sir, let us go, &s;aid he, I can &s;tand this no longer.</P>
<P>When they had reached Home, and that <HI>Harry</HI> was more compo&s;ed; Are all the Mi&s;eries, Sir, &s;aid he, that we have wit|ne&s;&s;ed
<PB N="265" REF="266">the&s;e two Days, the Con&s;equences of Sin? Even &s;o, indeed, my <HI>Harry,</HI> all the&s;e and Thou&s;ands more, equally pitiable and di&s;gu&s;ting, are the natural Progeny of that Woe-begetting Parent. Nor are tho&s;e Mi|&s;eries confined to Ho&s;pitals alone; every Hou&s;e, nay every Bo&s;om is a certain though &s;ecret Lazar-hou&s;e, where the &s;ick Couch is preparing, with all the di&s;mal Ap|paratus, for Tears and Lamentations, for Agonies and Death.</P>
<P>Since that is the Ca&s;e, Sir, who would laugh any more; is it not like Fea&s;ting in the Mid&s;t of Famine, and Dancing amid the Tombs?</P>
<P>All Things in their Sea&s;on, my Dear, provided that tho&s;e who laugh be as though they laughed not, rememb'ring that they mu&s;t weep. And provided that tho&s;e who weep be as though they wept not, having Joy in their Knowledge that the Fa&s;hion of this World quickly pa&s;&s;eth away.</P>
<P>On the following Day, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> re|turned to <HI>Ham&s;tead,</HI> but left three thou&s;and Pounds with <HI>Harry</HI> and Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> to be di&s;po&s;ed of, at their Di&s;cretion, among the Poor of the &s;everal Pari&s;hes of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">
For this beneficent Purpo&s;e, they applied to the Clergy and Churchwardens of the re&s;pective Pari&s;hes, but did not wholly tru&s;t to their Recommendation. They witne&s;&s;ed in Per&s;on the Merits of the &s;everal Objects. After the Example of their divine Ma&s;ter, <HI>they went about doing Good;</HI> changing the Face of Affliction into Chear; turning the Voice of Mourning into Songs of Thank&s;|giving; lightening every Burden, &s;upply|ing every Want, and binding up the broken of Heart.</P>
<P>One Evening, as our Companions were drinking Tea in the Temple-Exchange Coffee-Hou&s;e, a Man, advanced in Years, but of a very re&s;pectable Appearance, got up and addre&s;&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;aid he, among the &s;everal Ho&s;pitals and other charitable Foundations that have done Honour to the Humanity of the Inhabitants of this City, there is one &s;till wanting, which, as I conceive, above all others, would give Di&s;tinction to the Beneficence of its Founders; it is a Hou&s;e for repenting Pro&s;titutes, an A&s;&s;y|lum for unhappy Wretches who have no other Home, to whom all Doors are &s;hut, to whom no Haven is open, no Habitation, or Hole for Re&s;t upon the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">
Mo&s;t of them have been &s;educed from native Innocence and Mode&s;ty by the Arts of cruel Men. Many have been deceived under Promi&s;e and Vows of Marriage; &s;ome, under the Appearance of the actual Ceremony, and afterward abandoned, or turned forth to Infamy by their barbarous and ba&s;e Undoers. Shall no Place then be left for Repentance even to tho&s;e who do repent? forbid it Charity, forbid it Man|hood. Man is born the natural Protector of the Weakne&s;s of Woman, and if he has not been able to guard her Innocence from Inva&s;ion, he ought at lea&s;t to provide a Reception for her Return to Virtue.</P>
<P>I have the Plan of this charitable Foun|dation in my Pocket; and, if any of you, Gentlemen, approve my Propo&s;al, and are willing to &s;ub&s;cribe, or to &s;olicit your Friends to &s;o beneficent a Purpo&s;e, I re|que&s;t your Company to the Leg Tavern over the Way.</P>
<P>Here, the Speaker walked toward the Door, and was followed by <HI>Harry</HI> and <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> and thirteen or fourteen more of the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>When a Fla&s;k of Port was brought, and the Company &s;eated round a large Table; the Gentleman produced his Plan, with a
<PB N="268" REF="269">Summary of the Rules and In&s;titutes for the Conduct of the Hou&s;e, which he pro|po&s;ed to call the <HI>Magdalen-Hou&s;e.</HI> A Plan which hath &s;ince been e&s;pou&s;ed, and hap|pily executed by others, without a&s;cribing any of the Merit to the fir&s;t Projector.</P>
<P>As all pre&s;ent applauded the Manner of the Scheme, and Intention of the Charity, each of them &s;ub&s;cribed from a hundred to twenty Pounds, till it came to <HI>Harry</HI>'s Turn, who &s;ub&s;cribed a thou&s;and Pounds in Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Name.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, &s;aid one of the Com|pany, that your large&s;t Contributions will ari&s;e from the Ladies, as the Whole is in|tended for the Benefit of the Sex. I &s;hall not, an&s;wered the Gentleman, apply to a &s;ingle Lady on this Occa&s;ion. Not one of them will dare to contribute a Penny, le&s;t it &s;hould be thought that they partly allow, in them&s;elves, the Vices that they can par|don or patronize in others. It is this that makes the Ca&s;e of the Wretches, whom we are about to befriend, deplorable be|yond Mea&s;ure. They are fir&s;t betrayed by our Sex, and then driven out to irretrieva|ble Infamy and Mi&s;ery by their own. For Women to Women, are as Turkeys to Turkeys, do but ca&s;t a little Dirt upon the Head of any one of them, and the re&s;t of
<PB N="269" REF="270">the Flock combine, in an In&s;tant, to pick out her Eyes and to tear her to Pieces.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mole,</HI> a learned Philo&s;opher, and a Man of principal Figure in the pre&s;ent Company, then addre&s;&s;ed the Projector and &s;aid, if you will admit me, Sir, into Part|ner&s;hip in the Conduct of your Scheme, I will engage to levy Contributions to the amount of &s;ome Thou&s;ands, over and above the Hundred I have already &s;ub&s;cribed. You are heartily welcome, Sir, replied the Gentleman, either to join or take the Con|duct of the Whole upon your&s;elf. Pro|vided the Good is done, I care not by what Means, all my Ends will be an&s;wered, I wi&s;h to be namele&s;s. That is not fair neither, &s;aid another of the Company; you, Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> had the Trouble of con|triving this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and you ought, at lea&s;t, to have the Honour, if not the Con|duct of your own Plan.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> Mr. <HI>Goodville!</HI> exclaimed <HI>Clement</HI> in a Surpri&s;e, eagerly &s;taring at him, and recollecting, as from a Dream, the altered Features of his quondam Friend and Benefactor. Pray, Sir, do you remem|ber any thing of one <HI>Clement,</HI> a worthle&s;s young Fellow, whom once in your Good|ne&s;s you conde&s;cended to patronize? <HI>Cle|ment, Clement!</HI> cried Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> getting up and ha&s;tening to him, and catching
<PB N="270" REF="271">him in his Arms, my dear, my dear <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> my Man of Merit and Misfortunes, how rejoiced am I to find you! God be prai&s;ed, God be prai&s;ed, it is at length in my Power to do &s;omething material for You. But, come with me to another Room, I have &s;omething to &s;ay to You. We will leave the&s;e Gentlemen, the while, to think further of the Plan that lies before them.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Goodville</HI> and <HI>Clement</HI> had withdrawn, Mr. <HI>Mole,</HI> &s;aid one of the Company, you are concerned in a Num|ber of the&s;e public Benefactions. Yes, Gentlemen, an&s;wered <HI>Mole,</HI> I believe there is no charitable In&s;titution of any Note in <HI>London,</HI> in which I am not a Tru&s;tee, and to which I am not a Contributer. For, though I do not &s;et up for Sanctification by Faith, yet, I think, I may pretend to &s;ome Ju&s;tification by Charity. Let the vulgar Herd pay their Prie&s;thood for cheat|ing them out of their Sen&s;es, I give no|thing to the fat Impo&s;tors, or their lucra|tive Fable; my Sub&s;tance is little enough for my&s;elf and the Poor. Why, pray Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> are you not a Chri&s;tian? No indeed, Ma&s;ter, an&s;wered <HI>Mole,</HI> nor any Man who has Sen&s;e enough to think for him&s;elf. Be plea&s;ed then, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> to hand me that Paper a Moment; here, Sir,
<PB N="271" REF="272">I da&s;h my Name and Contribution from the Li&s;t of the Sub&s;cribers. He, who denies <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t,</HI> can never have <HI>Peace or good Will toward Men,</HI> and &s;o, Sir, you &s;hall never be the Almoner of a Pen|ny of my Money.</P>
<P>You talk as you look, my Dear, cried <HI>Mole,</HI> like One ju&s;t eloped from the Nur|&s;ery, where you were affrighted by Tales of Gho&s;ts and Hobgoblins. I acknowledge, Gentlemen, the Benefit and Beauty of Morality in its fulle&s;t Extent; and, had <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Chri&s;tian Prophet, confined him|&s;elf to his Sy&s;tem of moral Precepts, I think he would ju&s;tly have been e&s;teemed the greate&s;t Philo&s;opher and Legi&s;lator that ever breathed. But, when he, or ra|ther his Di&s;ciples, in his Name, in order to enhance the Authority of their Mi&s;&s;ion, pretended to Divinity in their Ma&s;ter, the low bred and ignorant Wretches pulled together, again&s;t the Grain, and compound|ed &s;uch a &s;trange Medley of fighting In|con&s;i&s;tencies, and &s;elf-evident Ab&s;urdities, as are wholly ever&s;ive of every Principle of right Rea&s;on and common Sen&s;e. They taught that God was made a Man; that, in order to expiate the Sins of the World, the Innocent was appointed to &s;uffer for the Guilty. That the Sins of all Offenders were to be imputed to One who had never offended; and that the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="272" REF="273">him, who had never offended, was to be imputed to Criminals of the deepe&s;t Dye. That the Creator &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the Malignity of his Creatures, and that God him&s;elf died a &s;hameful Death on the Cro&s;s. And this, Gentlemen, makes &s;uch a Heap of ridiculous Incoherencies, &s;uch Contradictions in Sen&s;e and Terms, as ex|ceeds even the Wor&s;hip of Apes and Ser|pents, Leeks and Onions, and the other Garbage of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>You are a Villain, and a Thief, and a Liar, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> altogether enflamed with Choler. <HI>Mole,</HI> on hearing the&s;e Terms of highe&s;t Affront and Reproach, in&s;tantly caught up a Bottle and threw it at our Hero's Head, but it happily mi&s;&s;ed him, and only brui&s;ed the fle&s;hy Part of the Shoulder of the Gentleman who &s;at next. <HI>Harry</HI> in&s;tantly &s;prung up and made at <HI>Mole,</HI> while the Company ro&s;e al&s;o and attempted to interfere; but &s;ome he ca&s;t on one Hand, and &s;ome on the Other, and overturning &s;uch as directly oppo&s;ed him, he reached <HI>Mole,</HI> and, with one Blow of his Fi&s;t on the Temple, laid him motionle&s;s along the Floor. Then looking down on his Adver&s;ary, I &s;hould be &s;orry, &s;aid he, that the Wretch would die in his pre&s;ent State of Reprobacy; here, Drawer, run quickly and bring me a Surgeon. Then
<PB N="273" REF="274">returning to his Place, he &s;at down with great Compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>After a Pau&s;e he looked around. I hope, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, that none of You are hurt. Indeed I am much concerned for having, in any Degree, contributed to your Di&s;turbance. But, had any of You a dear Benefactor and Patron, to whom you were bound beyond Mea&s;ure, whom you loved and honoured above all Things, could ye bear to hear him defamed and vilified to your Face? No certainly, an&s;wered One; no Man could bear it, cried Another; but pray, a&s;ked a Third, how came you to call the Gentleman a Thief?&mdash;Becau&s;e, re|plied our Hero, he attempted to rob me of my whole E&s;tate. He endeavoured to thieve from me the only Friend I had in the Uni|ver&s;e, the Friend of my Heart, the Peace and Re&s;t of my Bo&s;om; my infinite Trea|&s;ure, my never ending Delight! the Friend without whom I would not choo&s;e to be; without whom, Exi&s;tence would become a Cur&s;e and an Abhorrence unto me. Hap|py young Creature! exclaimed an elderly Gentleman, I under&s;tand you, you mean your Chri&s;t and my Chri&s;t, the Friend who has already opened his early Heaven with|in You.</P>
<P>By this, Mr. <HI>Mole</HI> began to move, where|upon <HI>Harry</HI> ro&s;e and, putting his Hand in
<PB N="274" REF="275">his Pocket, here, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, is one Guinea for the Surgeon and another for the Reckoning. When my Companion returns, be plea&s;ed to tell him I am gone to our Lodgings. For I will not &s;tay to hold further Conver&s;e or Altercation with that Bane of Society, that Pe&s;t, which the Rulers in Darkne&s;s have commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;pread Contagion, Di&s;temper and Death among Men.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> went early to Bed, but lay re&s;tle&s;s and much di&s;turbed in his Spirit all Night. Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> had heared the Particulars of our Hero's Behaviour, which he partly di&s;|approved; but, as he &s;aw him already de|jected, he did not choo&s;e to expo&s;tulate with him for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next Day they returned to <HI>Ham&s;tead,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the con|&s;trained Smiles of his <HI>Harry,</HI> ob&s;erved an unu&s;ual Cloud and Unea&s;ine&s;s in his Coun|tenance. I want to &s;peak with You, my Love, &s;aid he; and beckoning him into his Clo&s;et, he took him affectionately by the Hand and made him &s;it be&s;ide him. What is the Matter, my Dear, &s;aid he, looking concernedly in his Face, what is it that has di&s;turbed the Peace of the Bo&s;om of my Beloved?</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">
Ah! Sir, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> I am, indeed, very unhappy. I doubt that I am partly lo&s;ing my Faith, and the Fear of that has given me inexpre&s;&s;ible Horror. It is like tearing me from a Fort, out of which there is no Home or Re&s;t for me in the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Harry</HI> made a Recital of the late Affair to his Patron, and having clo&s;ed his Narrative, is not this very wonderful, Sir, &s;aid he, how or where in the World could this <HI>Mole</HI> have mu&s;tered together &s;uch Ar|guments again&s;t Rea&s;on, &s;uch Appearances again&s;t Truth? How mu&s;t the Vulgar and Illiterate be &s;taggered by &s;uch Objections; when, even I, who have been bred, as I may &s;ay, at the Feet of &s;uch a <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> have not been able to an&s;wer them, other|wi&s;e than by the Cha&s;ti&s;ement which the Bla&s;phemer received at my Hand.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;miled and &s;aid, don't be alarmed, my Love. We &s;hall quickly di&s;pel the thin Mi&s;ts of Infidelity that were collected to &s;hut the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s from your Eye. I confe&s;s, indeed, that this Spawn of Antichri&s;t has compiled a Summary of All that has ever been utter|ed, again&s;t <HI>the Lamb who was &s;lain from the Foundation of the Word;</HI> yet he is but a <HI>Mole</HI> in Nature as well as Name; and he, with his Brother-Moles, know no more
<PB N="276" REF="277">and &s;ee no further than the little Heap of Dirt and Rubbi&s;h, that the working of their own purblind and floundering Rea&s;on hath ca&s;t about them.</P>
<P>Sacred Depths and &s;tupendous My&s;teries belong to this Matter, and when you are able to bear them, they &s;hall be clearly and fully unfolded to you, my <HI>Harry:</HI> In the mean Space, a few &s;imple Ob&s;ervations will &s;uffice to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Peace of your &s;weet and pious Heart.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;tianity was in&s;tituted for the Salvation of the Vulgar, the principal Truths thereof are very obvious and plain, and want no Learning, no Letters, to in|culcate or teach them. They &s;peak the Language of Nature, and all Nature is ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the Sen&s;e and the Sound there|of. Whatever is within you, whatever is without you, cries aloud for a Saviour. For Sin hath been as the <HI>Mezentius,</HI> of whom you read in <HI>Virgil,</HI> who bound the Bodies of the Dead to the Per&s;ons of the Living. Thus it is that the Sin of fallen Angels, and of fallen Man, hath bound Change and Corruption, Di&s;temperature and Death, to the Elements, to the Vege|tables, to Animals, and even to the im|mortal Image of God him&s;elf in the Hu|manity; &s;o that all Things cry out, with the Apo&s;tle Saint <HI>Paul, who &s;hall deliver me
<PB N="277" REF="278">from the Body of this Death?</HI> So that all Things cry out, with the Apo&s;tle Saint <HI>Peter, &s;ave Lord, or I peri&s;h!</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are inevitable Truths, my <HI>Harry,</HI> which all Men, at &s;ome time, mu&s;t feel throughout their Exi&s;tence, whether they read them or not. And he alone who never experienced nor ever &s;hall experience Frailty, Error, or Sickne&s;s, Pain, Angui&s;h, or Di&s;&s;olution, is exempt from our Solar Sy&s;tem of Salvation from Sin.</P>
<P>But, what Sort of a Saviour is it, for whom all Things cry &s;o loudly? Is it a dry Morali&s;t, a Legi&s;lator of bare and external Precepts, &s;uch as your Mole-Philo&s;opher required our <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to be? No, my Darling, no. The Influence and Exi&s;tence of the Redeemer of Nature mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be as exten&s;ive as Nature her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Things are defiled and corrupted through|out, they are di&s;tempered and devoted to Death from the inmo&s;t E&s;&s;ence of their Being; and nothing, under him, in whom they live and move and have their Being, can redeem, can re&s;tore them.</P>
<P>O Sir, exclaimed <HI>Harry,</HI> his Countenance brightening up, why could I not think of this? I &s;hould then have been able to foil
<PB N="278" REF="279">my malignant Adver&s;ary, even at his own Weapons.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> him&s;elf, continued Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> appeals to the Truth I have told you, where he &s;ays to the Sick of the Pal&s;y, Son, be of good cheer, thy Sins are for|given thee. But, when the Phari&s;ees, thereupon, concluded that he bla&s;phemed; he demon&s;trated his Influence in and over the Soul, by the &s;en&s;ible Evidence of his Operation and Influence in and over the Body. What rea&s;on ye in your Hearts? &s;aid <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> whether is it ea&s;ier to &s;ay thy Sins be forgiven thee, or to &s;ay, ri&s;e up and walk? Then &s;aid he to the Sick of the Pal&s;y, ari&s;e and take up thy Couch, and go to thine Hou&s;e. And immediately he ro&s;e up before them, and took up that whereon he had been carried, and depart|ed to his own Hou&s;e, glorifying God.</P>
<P>Here it was nece&s;&s;ary, for the perform|ance of this wonderful and in&s;tantaneous Cure, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hould in&s;tantly operate in and through every Member, Nerve, and Fibre of the Sick of the Pal&s;y. And it was equally nece&s;&s;ary, for that Purpo&s;e, that the Sick of the Pal&s;y &s;hould have lived, and have had his Being in <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> In like Manner, al&s;o, his Sins, mu&s;t have been pardoned, by an inward Salvation, by im|parting to the Will of the Sinner a new
<PB N="279" REF="280">and rectified Will; and by informing his Spirit with a Dete&s;tation of Evil and a Love of Goodne&s;s and Virtue.</P>
<P>But, pray Sir, if it is not too profound a My&s;tery for me, be plea&s;ed to inform me, how God could be made Man? for this was one of the principal Objections of <HI>Mole.</HI></P>
<P>God was never made Man, my <HI>Harry.</HI> God cannot be deba&s;ed. He could not degrade him&s;elf by any Change into Man|hood, though he could exalt and a&s;&s;ume Humanity into God. Neither could God die or &s;uffer. To this, Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who was God and Man, bears Te&s;timony; where he cries out, in the Agonies of his &s;uffering Humanity, <HI>my God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> And again, where, crying with a loud Voice, he &s;aid, <HI>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.</HI>&mdash;But, you are leading me &s;omething deeper than I cho&s;e to go, for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>From Eternity, God &s;aw that, &s;hould he produce any Creatures in his own Image, to be glorious by his Likene&s;s and happy by his Communication, he mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity create them intelligent and free; and that con&s;equently; as Creatures, they mu&s;t be finite; and that, as Creatures who were free, they &s;hould al&s;o be fallible.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="281">
He, therefore, &s;aw that all might fall, and he al&s;o fore&s;aw that &s;ome would fall. But his Graciou&s;ne&s;s had provided <HI>two infallible Remedies</HI> for this Evil of Fallibility. He had provided a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and he had al&s;o provided <HI>Suffering.</HI> The <HI>Saviour</HI> was to re&s;tore them by an inward Redemption, by a Reinfu&s;ion and new Birth of his own Na|ture in their E&s;&s;ence. And <HI>Suffering</HI> was to prepare and open his Way, by humbling their Pride, by mortifying their Lu&s;t, and thus compelling them to unfold their Hearts to their own Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed, had no Creature ever fallen, God could not have been duely glorified to all Eternity. Millions of his infinitely amiable Qualities mu&s;t have lain an in|&s;crutable Secret to Worlds upon Worlds. While all his Creatures were happy in him, and participated of him, no Di&s;tinction could be duely made between them and their Creator. Had Evil never been, Good|ne&s;s would have &s;unk un&s;peakably in the Sen&s;e of its Value, which is now infinitely heightened and glorified by the Contra&s;t. Free Grace and free Mercy on the Part of our God, and Penitence and Thank&s;giving on the Part of humbled Sinners, would have been prevented of their thou&s;and en|dearing Connections. And all the Amities and Charities, throughout the Brotherhood
<PB N="281" REF="282">of Man; all the melting and fond Relations, which the Vine-Chri&s;t infu&s;es throughout his ingrafted Branches, bearing Blo&s;&s;oms and Fruits of divine Fragrance and Flavour, mu&s;t ever have remained, unble&s;&s;ing and as dead, from Eternity to Eternity.</P>
<P>But, our God, my Child, is as powerful, as he is gracious and wi&s;e, to bring Light out of Darkne&s;s, and Life out of Death, and infinite and ever enduring Good out of the limited and &s;hort State of tran&s;itory Evil.</P>
<P>To prove that no Being, beneath him&s;elf, could &s;tand of their own Sufficiency, God permitted his two principal Creatures, the mo&s;t immediate and mo&s;t glorious Repre|&s;entatives of his divine Perfections, to fall off from their Allegiance, and con&s;equent|ly from their Happine&s;s, with all their Progeny. The fir&s;t was the Angel <HI>Lucifer</HI> who fell through <HI>Pride,</HI> and the &s;econd was the Man <HI>Adam</HI> who fell through <HI>Lu&s;t.</HI> The&s;e two capital Sins of <HI>Pride</HI> and of <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> are the genuine Parents of all moral and natural E|vil, of all the Guilt and Mi&s;ery that ever did or ever can ari&s;e throughout Duration; and our heavenly Father, in his Love, hath appointed inten&s;e Suffering, to abate and aba&s;e the <HI>one,</HI> and to mortify and &s;lay the <HI>other,</HI> that Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors may finally be capable of his Mercy, through the Salva|tion and Grace of his Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="283">
The fir&s;t of the&s;e Arch-felons deemed him&s;elf worthy of Deity, and, being unex|perienced in the Power with whom he had to contend, he attempted to arrogate all Wor&s;hip to him&s;elf, and to rob his divine Benefactor of Glory and Godhead.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of the&s;e Felons was tempt|ed, by the fir&s;t, to a&s;pire, through his own Merits, at a godlike Independence; to ca&s;t off his Allegiance to the Author of his Be|ing; and to expect. Intelligence and Know|ledge from the &s;en&s;ual Fruits of this World, after which he lu&s;ted. He accordingly took and eat of the Tree that was preg|nant with all the Goods and all the Evils of this external, elementary, and tran&s;ient Sy&s;|tem, <HI>according to his Faith it was done unto him;</HI> according to his Lu&s;t his De&s;ire was accompli&s;hed; his Nature became a Par|taker of temporary Nature; and he fell, with his Progeny, into all the Depravity and Evils, that the Sin of fallen <HI>Lucifer</HI> had introduced into the&s;e va&s;t Regions; now made more exceedingly corrupt and &s;inful by the Sin of fallen <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>Why, pray Sir, demanded <HI>Harry,</HI> had <HI>Lucifer</HI> any Concern in this World, before the Fall of our fir&s;t Parents?</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="284">
Yes, my Dear, all the Space, that is now occupied by this Earth, and the&s;e Ele|ments with the Sun, Moon and Stars, to an inconceivable Extent; was once the Heaven and Dominion of <HI>Lucifer</HI> and his Angels. But when, by their Apo&s;tacy from the Light and Love and Goodne&s;s of God, they had cau&s;ed Darkne&s;s and Ma|lignity, Envy, Rage, and Uproar, and every Species of Evil and Horror, to be predominant throughout their Kingdom; God determined, by a new Creation, to take it out of their Hands. Accordingly, he compacted it into the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of temporary Nature, who&s;e Duration is to be mea&s;ured by the Revolution of our Luminaries, until the appointed Period of the great Con&s;ummation, when all the Malignity that remains, and is compacted therein, &s;hall be finally done away.</P>
<P>To this Truth <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> bears Te&s;timony, where he tells you that, at the Commence|ment of Creation, Darkne&s;s was upon the Face of the great Deep. And again, where he tells you, that the Tree of the Know|ledge of the Goods and Evils of this World &s;prung up, even in the Mid&s;t of the Para|di&s;e of God. But it is altogether impious and bla&s;phemous to &s;uppo&s;e, that God would create Evil, or infu&s;e a Tendency
<PB N="284" REF="285">thereto into any of his Works. Again, the &s;ame Truth is atte&s;ted by many Pa&s;|&s;ages of the &s;acred Writings; where <HI>Luci|fer,</HI> or Satan, tells Chri&s;t, to his Face, that this World, with all its Glories, are his Portion and Property, that they were deli|vered unto him, and that he giveth them to whom&s;oever he will. And again, where Chri&s;t calls him the Prince of the Air; and again, where he &s;ays <HI>the Prince of this World cometh and hath no Part in me.</HI></P>
<P>Now, when God, by his new Creation, had delivered this Sy&s;tem of Things from the Influence and Dominion of evil Spirits, they became altogether Pri&s;oners in their own Darkne&s;s. But when <HI>Adam,</HI> the &s;e|cond Lord of this va&s;t Domain, by a &s;e|cond Apo&s;tacy, had brought additional Sin and Evil into temporary Nature, the Para|di&s;e of God, that was over all, vani&s;hed; and the new Guilt of <HI>Adam</HI> opened a new and wide Gate, for the Re-admi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Lucifer</HI> into his ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. And he remains a Prince and a Ruler in the Elements and Hearts of Men unto this evil Day.</P>
<P>The&s;e two capital Apo&s;tates, <HI>Lucifer</HI> and <HI>Adam,</HI> who had thus robbed their kind God of their Affections and Allegi|ance, were thereafter repre&s;ented by the two Thieves who &s;uffered in Company with
<PB N="285" REF="286">Chri&s;t who reached out to them a bleeding Arm of his Mercy on either Hand. The One accepted his Grace and, on that Day, entered Paradi&s;e along with his Lord. The Other rejected the Chri&s;t with Contempt and Reproach, and therefore, if ever re|claimable, mu&s;t be con&s;trained by Suffering to open his Heart to Redemption; when after a Proce&s;s of many many agonizing Ages, bla&s;pheming and indignantly &s;purn|ing at the Power of his Puni&s;her, he may be compelled to cry out, O Seed of the Woman! heal, heal the Head thou ha&s;t cru&s;hed, and admit me al&s;o, tho' la&s;t, to &s;ome Part, the lea&s;t Portion of thy pardon|ing Salvation!</P>
<P>The&s;e Two, my <HI>Harry,</HI> even <HI>Lucifer</HI> and <HI>Adam,</HI> were al&s;o the Thieves among whom the Traveller fell, going from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Jericho,</HI> from the City and Place of Peace to the Place of De&s;truction. He repre&s;ent|ed the wretched Race of fallen Man, whom <HI>Lucifer</HI> and their fir&s;t Father had robbed of all their Sub&s;tance, and &s;tripped of their Robe of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and wounded, and left half dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins. Nei|ther did the Law or the Prie&s;thood avail any Thing for their Cure till JESUS the GOOD SAMARITAN had Compa&s;&s;ion upon them, and bound up their Wounds, pour|ing therein the Oil of his Grace and the Wine of his Gladne&s;s; and expended two
<PB N="286" REF="287">Pence, even the two precious Pence of his own Body and Blood for perfecting their Recovery.</P>
<P>But, my deare&s;t Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> if my Que&s;tion does not intrude, pray how was it con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice that the Suffer|ings of the Innocent &s;hould attone both for, and in&s;tead of, the Guilty? For this al&s;o was one of <HI>Mole</HI>'s cardinal Objections.</P>
<P>Your Que&s;tion, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> falls aptly in its Place. When <HI>Adam,</HI> as I have told you, apo&s;tati&s;ed from his God, and lu&s;ted after the gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ual Fruits of this World, and fed upon them, and there|upon, became a Partaker of their Nature and Malignity; he fell from his Paradi&s;e and Sovereignty together, and he became a poor Subject and mi&s;erable Slave to all the Evils and Inclemencies of that tempora|ry Nature, over which he had been con&s;ti|tuted a throned Lord and Controuler.</P>
<P>Here was a deep and a woful Fall, my <HI>Harry,</HI> from Sovereignty to Slavery, from Eternity into Time, from Immortality into Corruption, from Bli&s;s into Mi&s;ery, and from Life into Death. The very State, in which the wretched Heirs of his fallen Na|ture find them&s;elves at this Day. How then was he to ri&s;e, if ever to ri&s;e again?
<PB N="287" REF="288">could this be effected by any Powers of his own? if he did not &s;tand in the State of his Strength, how &s;hall he recover and be able to rea&s;cend in the State of his Weakne&s;s? how think you, my <HI>Harry?</HI> A &s;elf evident Impo&s;&s;ibility, an&s;wered <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, continued Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> we find the Univer&s;e of Man depraved, fallen, and &s;unk into the Darkne&s;s of Sin and Error, into the Dungeon of gro&s;s and cor|ruptible Fle&s;h, and circled about and clo&s;ed in by the Barriers and Gates of Death. And the&s;e Pri&s;ons were to be broken through, the&s;e Gates were to be bur&s;t open, before he could re-enter upon Light and Immortality. All the Enemies who had conquered Man, <HI>Sin, Satan,</HI> and <HI>Temp|tation</HI> were al&s;o to be conquered. But, how was this to be done? A World lay at Stake, and the great Que&s;tion was, whe|ther the whole Race of Man &s;hould con|tinue in endle&s;s Guilt and Mi&s;ery, or be re&s;tored to ever-during Purity and Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s? Wherefore, what all the Powers of Creation were not able to attempt, <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in the Humanity, undertook to accom|pli&s;h.</P>
<P>Here you &s;ee, my Child, that Ju&s;tice had little to do in the Ca&s;e. It was not the <HI>Ju&s;tice of Puni&s;hment,</HI> but the <HI>Mercy of
<PB N="288" REF="289">Deliverance</HI> that the Love of our heavenly Father required. Ju&s;tice indeed affirmed that Suffering was due to Sin, and was the nece&s;&s;ary Attendant and Con&s;equence there|of; but this al&s;o the Love of our Chri&s;t willingly took upon him&s;elf. He conquer|ed Suffering, through Sufferings, and was thereby made the perfect and accompli&s;hed Captain of our Salvation. He entered into our Fle&s;h, he went through all the Pa&s;&s;ages of this Vale of Tears and Region of Mi&s;e|ry, into which we were fallen; through Poverty, Contempt, Rejection, Reproach; through all that the Rage and Rancour of Men and Devils could inflict, his bloody Sweat and angui&s;hing Horrors of Hell, Bonds, Buffetings, Spittings, Scourgings, the bloody Mockery of a thorny Crown, and all the Soul-rending Tortures of an agonizing Crucifixion, till at la&s;t, he triumphantly cried <HI>it is fini&s;hed!</HI> and gave up the Gho&s;t. From the Cro&s;s he de|&s;cended into the Grave; from the Grave again, he ro&s;e in Glory and a&s;cended into Heaven, where he led Captivity Captive, and &s;hewed the Powers of Darkne&s;s bound; that he might lead all the Followers of his beatific Cro&s;s, in his own divine Proce&s;s, to Conque&s;t through Sufferings, to Glory through Aba&s;ement, to Exaltation through Humiliation, through Death unto Life, and through the Calamities of Time to a never ending, ever ble&s;&s;ing, ever joyful Eternity!</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="290">
But, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> was the Humanity of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour the &s;ame as ours is? for &s;o the Scripture &s;eems to intimate, where it &s;ays, he was made Man, like unto us in all Things, Sin only excepted.</P>
<P>This was only &s;poken, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> with re&s;pect to his outward Hu|manity. His creaturely Soul indeed, and the Fle&s;h which he derived from his mortal Mother, were even as ours are, Sin only excepted. But, the&s;e were only as the Hu&s;k or Ca&s;e of his internal and divine Humanity, which was conceived from the E&s;&s;ence of the FATHER, by the Operation of the HOLY SPIRIT in the Womb of a pure Virgin. It was this Humanity to which JESUS was intimately united, and that became one with the ever ble&s;&s;ed TRI|NITY. And it was of the Ubiquity of this Humanity that Chri&s;t &s;peaketh, when he &s;ays to <HI>Nicodemus, no Man hath a&s;cended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heaven.</HI> But, when the external Huma|nity of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was, by Suffering and Death, prepared to be &s;wallowed up of Glory, the whole CHRIST was then a&s;&s;umed up into Godhead. He &s;aw all Things in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as they were and &s;hall be from Eternity to Eternity. And, though the Glory of his per&s;onal Appearance may be vi&s;ible in cer|tain Places, yet he is invi&s;ibly pre&s;ent in
<PB N="290" REF="291">all Places and in all Hearts, begetting in them a new Birth of his own divine Hu|manity; that their Bodies may al&s;o be fa&s;hioned like unto his glorious Body; and that, when our Corruptible &s;hall have put on Incorruption, and when that our Mor|tal &s;hall have put on Immortality, <HI>We All may be made One, as He is in the Father and the Father in him, that we al&s;o may be One in them.</HI> An Elevation, &s;ure, well worth the harde&s;t Striving, the highe&s;t Ambition!</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewn you, my <HI>Harry,</HI> the inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity of the Suffering of our innocent Chri&s;t for the Salvation of guilty Sinners. And this al&s;o &s;hews you the equal Nece&s;&s;ity of his taking upon him&s;elf the ex|ternal Imputation of the Sins for which he &s;uffered; that he might, thereby, be in|wardly imputed to us, and become to us and in us the LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS; and be to us a better <HI>Adam,</HI> a &s;econd and divine Father, regenerating us to a Birth of his own heavenly Nature. And thus, as the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> died unto God, and lived to fallen Nature; there was a Nece&s;&s;ity that Chri&s;t, as well in his own Per&s;on, as his redeemed Progeny, &s;hould die to the fallen Nature, that through him they might live again unto God.</P>
<P>O thank you, thank you, Sir, cried <HI>Har|ry,</HI> I &s;hall henceforth be enabled to give an
<PB N="291" REF="292">Account, to all who a&s;k, of the Faith that is in me. But pray, did the divine Huma|nity of our Chri&s;t &s;uffer in the Crucifixion?</P>
<P>I believe it did, <HI>Harry,</HI> even as our Souls are found to &s;uffer in our Bodies, though of a Nature &s;o very different from them. It was the Suffering of this divine Humanity that cau&s;ed &s;uch violent Repug|nance and Convul&s;ions in Nature; that &s;hut up the World from Light even at mid Day; that rent the Rocks, that opened the Graves, and gave up the Dead to attend their Lord and revive in the Life of his Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Will you be plea&s;ed, Sir, to indulge me in one Que&s;tion more? Could not God, in his Omnipotence, have affected the Salva|tion of Man by &s;ome other Means than the Suffering of our dear Chri&s;t? I think, were it to be done again, I would rather forfeit my Salvation, than that He &s;hould endure &s;uch Agony on my Account.</P>
<P>I will not pretend, my <HI>Harry,</HI> to give Limits or Directions to the Mea&s;ures of my God, neither to &s;ay what he might or might not do within his own World, and with regard to his own Creatures. But, it is certain that he cho&s;e the mo&s;t effectual Method, for compa&s;&s;ing his great and eter|nal
<PB N="292" REF="293">Purpo&s;e, that infinite Love could dic|tate, infinite Wi&s;dom contrive, and infinite Power execute. O my <HI>Harry,</HI> how un|utterably endeared mu&s;t this Mea&s;ure make our God to the Univer&s;e of his Creatures, and that to all Eternity! It is herein that the Nature of our God is revealed, it is hereby alone that he could ever have been duely known; known to be the God of Love, to be nothing but Love, in this his wonderful Work of Mercy tran&s;cending Mercy, and of Grace tran&s;cending Grace, that he might bring us to Glory tran&s;cend|ing Glory!</P>
<P>In this &s;tupendous Work of Redemption, I &s;ay, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> makes him&s;elf as it were little, that we may become great; He &s;toops in|to Manhood that he may exalt us into God. He came not arrayed in the Fool's Coat of the Lu&s;tre of this de&s;picable World, nor in the Weakne&s;s of its Power, nor in the Meanne&s;s of its Dignity; but over his Immen&s;ity he threw the Appearance of Li|mitation, and with Time he inve&s;ted his Eternity; and his Omnipotence put on Frailty, and his Supremacy put on Sub|jection; and with the Veil of Mortality, he &s;hrouded his Beauty, that he might be|come familiar to us, that we might behold and conver&s;e with him Face to Face, as Man conver&s;es with Man and grows fond of his Fellow.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="294">
Before the Incarnation, God was feared in his Thunders, and adored in the Ma|je&s;ty and Magnificence of his Works. But, it is in the meek and lowly <HI>Je&s;us</HI> that he becomes the Object of Affection, in the bleeding, the &s;uffering, the dying <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> we behold him with weeping Gratitude, we love him with a Love of Pa&s;&s;ion and Burning, a Love that langui&s;hes for him, that cannot bear to exi&s;t without him.</P>
<P>How could that perver&s;e People &s;hut their Eyes to the Divinity of their gracious <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> while he gave &s;uch hourly and occular Proofs of the Power and Extent of his Godhead, in and over all Things? while he went about doing Good, carrying Healing in his Breath, in his Touch, in his Garments; while the Lame &s;prung up as a bounding Roe at his Bidding; while the Tempe&s;t heared his Voice and was &s;till, and the Sea &s;pread it&s;elf as a Carpet beneath the Foot of its Creator. While the deaf Ear was opened, and the dumb Tongue loo&s;ed to Utterance; while he poured the Beams of his Light upon the new-opening Eyes of the blind-born Gazer; and while in Death and amid&s;t the Tombs his Word was Life and Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Thus, my <HI>Harry,</HI> you find your&s;elf uni|ted to your Saviour by many endearing and intimate Connections; by Creation, by Re|demption,
<PB N="294" REF="295">by Brotherhood, by Fatherhood, in the Fle&s;h, in the Spirit; by his being Bone of your Bone; and Spirit of your Spi|rit, by being the <HI>Fir&s;t-Born of many Bre|thren,</HI> and by being the divine Father of a new and cele&s;tial Progeny.</P>
<P>But, what need we further? the World, from the Beginning, is fraught with him and &s;peaks of him. The World is, in it|&s;elf, no other than a Hi&s;tory of the two capital and eternally important Truths, THE GREATNESS OF THE FALL in <HI>Luci|fer</HI> and <HI>Adam,</HI> and THE GREATNESS OF THE REDEMPTION in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The&s;e Truths are engraven in the Rocks as deep as the Centre; they are written on both Sides of every Leaf in Nature. All that is within us, All that is without us utters forth the &s;ame Language, proclaims the &s;ame Tidings aloud. All Ceremonials, all In&s;ti|tutions of divine Authority, all ancient Pre|dictions and Prophecies were pregnant with and in Travail of the GREAT DELIVE|RANCE to be atchieved by the <HI>Shiloh</HI> who was to come. They give us a previous Hi&s;tory of his whole Proce&s;s upon Earth, from his Birth to his Re&s;urrection, as cir|cum&s;tantially, as minutely, as though it were a bare Tran&s;cript of what had recent|ly pa&s;&s;ed before their Eyes. But I &s;hall only dwell a Minute on three principal Ar|ticles,
<PB N="295" REF="296">fir&s;t, that Me&s;&s;iah was to be God&mdash;&s;econdly, that he was however to be a &s;uffering Me&s;&s;iah&mdash;and thirdly, that he was to give him&s;elf to Death for the Salva|tion of Sinners.</P>
<P>FIRST, with Re&s;pect to his Divinity, <HI>Daniel</HI> &s;ays: <Q>I &s;aw in the Night Vi&s;ions, and behold, One like unto the SON OF MAN came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came to the ANCIENT OF DAYS, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him DOMINION and GLORY, and a KINGDOM, that all Peo|ple, Nations, and Languages &s;hould &s;erve him; his DOMINION is an EVERLAST|ING DOMINION which &s;hall not pa&s;s a|way.</Q> Again <HI>I&s;aiah:</HI> <Q>Behold a Virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a Son. For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government &s;hall be upon his Shoulder; and his Name &s;hall be call|ed WONDERFUL, COUNSELLOR, the MIGHTY GOD, the EVERLASTING FA|THER, the PRINCE of PEACE. Of the Increa&s;e of his GOVERNMENT and PEACE there &s;hall be NO END, upon the Throne of <HI>David,</HI> and upon his King|dom, to order it, and to e&s;tabli&s;h it, with JUDGMENT and with JUSTICE, from henceforth even FOR EVER.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="297">
SECONDLY, with Re&s;pect to his Charac|ter of Rejection and Suffering: <Q>Who hath believed our Report and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed? He is de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of Men, a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, and we hid as it were our Faces from him; he was de&s;pi&s;ed and we e&s;teemed him not. He was oppre&s;&s;ed and he was af|flicted; he is brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb, &s;o openeth he not his Mouth. He was taken from Pri&s;on and from Judgment; and who &s;hall declare his Generation? for he was cut off out of the Land of the Living, for the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of my People was he &s;tricken. And he made his Grave with the Wick|ed, and with the Rich in his Death. <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI></Q>&mdash;<HI>David</HI> too &s;ays, <Q>Dogs have compa&s;&s;ed me, the A&s;&s;embly of the Wicked have enclo&s;ed me; they pierced my Hands and my Feet. They part my Garments among them, and ca&s;t Lots for my Ve&s;ture.&mdash;But, a Bone of him &s;hall not be broken.&mdash;They &s;hall look on him whom they pierced.</Q></P>
<P>THIRDLY, with Re&s;pect to his being a willing Offering for Sin. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ays, in the &s;ame Chapter: <Q>Surely he hath born our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; yet we did e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mitten of
<PB N="297" REF="298">God, and afflicted. But, he was wound|ed for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;|ed for our Iniquities; the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of our Peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are healed. All we like Sheep have gone a&s;tray; we have turn|ed every one to his own Way, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us All.</Q> <HI>Jeremiah</HI> too&mdash;</P>
<P>Here, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was interrupted. His Man <HI>Frank</HI> entered, booted, and all be|&s;pattered with Dirt, and having whi&s;pered Something in his Ma&s;ter's Ear, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> turned a&s;ide his Head, to hide his Concern from <HI>Harry,</HI> and &s;tepping to his Clo&s;et, locked him&s;elf in.</P>
<P>BUT, it may be thought full Time to return to the Head-Branch of this noble Family.</P>
<P>Nearly nine Years had now elap&s;ed, &s;ince the Earl and his Lady had &s;een or heared of their <HI>Harry,</HI> except by two or three anonymous Notes, in a Year, giving a &s;hort Account of his Health and Accom|pli&s;hments; in&s;omuch that Time and long Ab&s;ence had, in a Mea&s;ure, worn him from the Regrets of the Family; except|ing his Brother <HI>Richard,</HI> on whom <HI>Harry</HI>'s Genero&s;ity, in taking his Quarrel upon
<PB N="298" REF="299">him&s;elf, had left an affecting, and indeli|ble Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Richard</HI> was, indeed, &s;weetly di&s;|po&s;itioned by Nature, and of an A&s;pect and Per&s;on extremely elegant; and as he had Tutors in all Branches, in which he cho&s;e to be in&s;tructed, he learned &s;uffi|cient, by Way of Amu&s;ement, to render him One of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Youths in the Nation. He was al&s;o, naturally, una&s;&s;uming and mode&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed; but the unremitted Adulation of Dome&s;tics and Dependents, with the complimentary Ar|tillery of all the Neighbours and Vi&s;itants, could not fail of &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to make it evident that he was con&s;cious of his Conde&s;cen&s;ion when he be|came familiar with you.</P>
<P>He was, however, ea&s;y to All who ap|plied to him for any Favour, exceeding charitable to the Poor; and particularly fond of our <HI>Harry</HI>'s Fo&s;termother, and kind to her for <HI>Harry</HI>'s Sake.</P>
<P>With &s;uch amiable Qualities, he was e&s;teemed and beloved of All, and became the little Idol of the adjacent Country, in|&s;omuch that, when he was &s;eized with the Small Pox, the Apprehen&s;ion and Anxiety for him was univer&s;al, and the great Man|&s;ion. Hou&s;e was hourly circled by People
<PB N="299" REF="300">who came crowding, to enquire concerning his Danger.</P>
<P>The Eruption was but &s;light, only a few Spots on his Face and other Parts, &s;o that my Lady was in high Triumph, on ob&s;erving, that the Beauty of her Darling &s;hould not be defaced. But ah, how frail is the Foundation on which Mortality builds for Happine&s;s! who can en&s;ure it, who can arre&s;t it for an Hour, for a Mo|ment? On the eleventh Day, when the Phy&s;icians pronounced that All was promi&s;|ing and full of Hope, Lord <HI>Richard</HI> was &s;uddenly taken with Convul&s;ions, and, in le&s;s than an Hour, expired.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Enna,</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Moreland,</HI> from whom the Seat had been newly denomi|nated <HI>Enna's Field</HI> or <HI>Enfield,</HI> was pre&s;ent at the Death of All that &s;he held mo&s;t pre|cious upon Earth. She had never left his Chamber &s;ince he had taken to his Bed; and was now carried off in a deep and death-like Swoon. She never after reco|vered her Sen&s;es, except by deplorable Starts, to lament that &s;he was the mo&s;t wretched of All that ever were created; and, on the &s;econd Day, She al&s;o expired, and was interred in the &s;ame Tomb with the Offspring of her Body and the Idol of her Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="301">
Never was &s;een &s;uch a Concour&s;e at any Funeral, &s;ince the Funeral of <HI>Jacob</HI> on which all <HI>Egypt</HI> attended. They crowded from a Di&s;tance of thirty Miles round. But, when they &s;aw the old and revered Patron of the Country, all covered with &s;ad and &s;olemn Weeds; when they beheld his Countenance exceeding all Pomp of Sorrow, and conceived the Weight and Wringing that was then at his Heart; Envy was quite blunted and robbed of its Sting. They now lamented the Living more than they mourned the Dead; and the poore&s;t among the Poor looked down, with an Eye of Compa&s;&s;ion upon the great Man, now rendered, as they deemed, more pitiable and de&s;olate even than them&s;elves; without Child or Kindred; without Any to continue his Name or his Honours; without Any who could claim a Share in his Wealth or his Woe; without any Cau&s;e of further Comfort or further Care upon Earth.</P>
<P>During the following Week the Earl kept his Chamber, and would admit of no Vi&s;itor, till Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> arrived.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> had long e&s;tranged him&s;elf to <HI>Enfield;</HI> he had gone el&s;where, &s;eeking the Hou&s;es of Mourning, and breathing Peace and Con&s;olation wherever he went; but as &s;oon as he heared of the Affliction of his noble Friend, he ha&s;tened to help him to
<PB N="301" REF="302">bear up under the Weight of his Calamity. He entered, and &s;eating him&s;elf in Silence be&s;ide the Earl, he there wept near an Hour without uttering a Syllable.</P>
<P>My Lord was the fir&s;t who &s;poke; Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid he, my Heart gratefully feels this melting Proof of your Love. You weep for me, my Friend, becau&s;e You &s;ee, and kindly feel, that there is no other Com|fort for me on this Side the Grave.</P>
<P>God forbid, God forbid, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Meek|ly,</HI> the be&s;t and greate&s;t of all Comforts is coming to you, my Lord. Eternal Truth has promi&s;ed it, and he will make it good to you; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed, ble&s;&s;ed are they who mourn, for they &s;hall be comforted.</HI></P>
<P>Ah, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> replied the Earl, the Comfort that you mention is promi&s;ed only to the deeply contrite and broken of Heart; to tho&s;e who duely lament the Ba&s;ene&s;s of their Offences again&s;t &s;o great and good a God. Neither do I de&s;pair, my Friend, but that I al&s;o may finally &s;hare &s;ome Por|tion of that &s;ame Comfort; for, as I feel|ingly acknowlege my&s;elf the greate&s;t of all Sinners, &s;o I wi&s;h for Grace to make me the greate&s;t of Penitents.</P>
<P>God be prai&s;ed, cried <HI>Meekly,</HI> for the Grace already given! There was a Time,
<PB N="302" REF="303">my Lord, when, as you told me, you had nothing of the&s;e divine Di&s;po&s;itions; when the World, as you &s;aid, &s;eemed to hold out Happine&s;s to you in either Hand; when Fortune, Title, Precedence, circling Ho|nours about you, and within you Youth and Health, and a revelling Flow of Blood and Spirits wholly di&s;gui&s;ed and concealed the State of your Nature from you; when they hid from you your own Body of Frail|ty, Di&s;temper, Sin and Death, and left you no Occa&s;ion to call out for a Saviour, as you felt nothing from which you de&s;ired to be &s;aved. But God has now been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;end you his Monitors, and to call upon you by Affliction, that you, in your Turn, may call upon him who alone can give you Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>It is not, my Lord, to the Mourners for Sin, alone, to whom Comfort is promi&s;ed. The State of Suffering and Mourning is in its Nature extremely &s;alutary and of happy Tendency to Man, and it is, therefore, that the &s;uffering <HI>Je&s;us</HI> hath pronounced it ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The God of ALL LOVE takes no Delight in the Sufferings of his poor and pitiable Creatures; neither would he have made this State of our Mortality a Vale of Tears and a State of Mi&s;ery, had it not been in order to conduct us, through tran&s;itory Evils to
<PB N="303" REF="304">ever enduring Bli&s;s, where he him&s;elf will wipe all Tears from our Eyes.</P>
<P>When <HI>Adam,</HI> by his Apo&s;ta&s;y and fall|ing off from his Maker, had converted all the Goods of this temporary State into evil Incitements to Lu&s;t, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and Sen|&s;uality; God determined, by a gracious Rever&s;e, to turn all the Evils of corrupt and fallen Nature into Means of enduring Good to his fallen and frail Creatures; he therefore appointed Pain, Affliction, Di|&s;tre&s;s and Di&s;ea&s;e to be his Mini&s;ters, his Monitors, and Preachers within us, to con|vince us of all the Evil of our depraved and mortal Nature; to wean us from a World that is full of fal&s;e Promi&s;es but empty of true Enjoyment; to remind us that we are Strangers and Pilgrims upon Earth, to turn our Eye to the Star that hath vi&s;ited us from on high; and finally, through our Sufferings, to accompli&s;h the great Work of his own Salvation in us.</P>
<P>Thank you, thank you, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> the&s;e are comforting Things indeed. They pluck Comfort from the very Depth and Aby&s;s of Affliction. I love that my God &s;hould be lovely to my Heart. You have now rent the dark Veil that long hung be|fore my Eyes; and the Sun of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s breaks upon me through the Clouds of my Mortality. &mdash; But, what of Death, Mr.
<PB N="304" REF="305"><HI>Meekly,</HI> what of Death, my Friend? I am intere&s;ted in the Que&s;tion; my Time is approaching. When this Body &s;hall fall to Du&s;t, and all the&s;e Organs of Sen&s;ation be utterly cut off; what remains, what then &s;hall follow? by what Means &s;hall my Spirit attain the Powers of new Perception; or am I to lye in the Grave, in a State of total In&s;en&s;ibility, till the la&s;t Trumpet &s;hall &s;ound? my Nature &s;hrinks, I confe&s;s, from a total Deprivation of the Sen&s;e of Exi&s;|tence.</P>
<P>It is no Way evident to me, my Lord, that Body, or at lea&s;t &s;uch gro&s;s Bodies as we now have, are nece&s;&s;ary to the Percep|tions and Sen&s;ibilities of our Spirit. God him&s;elf is a Spirit, an all-&s;eeing, all-hearing, all-ta&s;ting, all-&s;melling, all-feeling, all-knowing, and all-governing Spirit. He who made the Eye, &s;hall he not &s;ee? He who made the Ear, &s;hall he not hear? Wherefore, as our Spirits are the Offsprings of his divine Spirit, we may ju&s;tly pre&s;ume them endowed with like Capacities. But, if Body is nece&s;&s;ary to the Perception of Spirit, as <HI>Zoroa&s;ter,</HI> the illuminated Philo|&s;opher, &s;eems to intimate, where, &s;peaking of God, he &s;ays, <Q>who&s;e Body is Light and who&s;e Soul is Truth,</Q> in this Ca&s;e, I &s;ay, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that when our Spirits &s;hall be parted from the&s;e gro&s;s and frail Bodies, they &s;hall be in&s;tantly
<PB N="305" REF="306">cloathed upon with more pure and perma|nent Bodies. Or, as I rather think, that tho&s;e pure and permanent Bodies are alrea|dy forming and pregnant within our gro&s;s and corruptible Bodies; and that when the Midwife Death &s;hall deliver us from the dark Womb of our woeful Travail and Mortality; we &s;hall immediately &s;pring forth into Incorruption and Glory.</P>
<P>Of this, my Lord, I am confident as I am of my Being, that He who, by Faith, hath already put on Chri&s;t, &s;hall break through Death in the Brightne&s;s of the Body of his new Birth, incorruptible, immortal and ble&s;&s;ed to all Eternity.</P>
<P>Tell me then, my deare&s;t <HI>Meekly,</HI> what mean you by the Body of this new Birth? For alas, I am but too apt to cry out with <HI>Nicodemus, How can the&s;e things be?</HI></P>
<P>I mean, my Lord, the forming of Chri&s;t within us. Our being formed anew of a divine Seed of our &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> even as our gro&s;s Bodies were formed in the Womb from a corruptible Seed of the old <HI>Adam.</HI> I mean the clothing of our Spirits with the heavenly Sub&s;tantiality of the &s;piritual Bo|dy and Blood of the heavenly <HI>Je&s;us</HI> him|&s;elf; for, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, there is a &s;piritual Body as there is a carnal Body. I
<PB N="306" REF="307">mean a Body the &s;ame as that, in which the believing Thief entered Paradi&s;e with his Lord on the Day of the Crucifixion. <HI>I am the Re&s;urrection and the Life,</HI> &s;aith JESUS, <HI>who&s;o believeth in me, though he were dead yet &s;hall he live, and he who liveth and believeth in me &s;hall never die.</HI> Death &s;hall become a new and divine Birth unto him. And the great Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>there are cele&s;tial Bodies and Bodies terre&s;trial; but the Glory of the Ce|le&s;tial is one, and the Glory of the Terre&s;trial is another.</HI> And again he &s;ays, <HI>for we know that if our earthly Hou&s;e of this Tabernacle were di&s;&s;olved, we have a Building of God, an Hou&s;e not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are great Things, indeed, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> and full of Hope as well as Incite|ments to divine Ambition.</P>
<P>But why, my Lord, &s;hould a new Birth from <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> be thought wonderful? is there any thing more wonderful in it than in the forming and unfolding of the whole &s;tupendous Mechani&s;m of the Body of our old Man, from a &s;carce vi&s;ible Speck of Entity? Is there any thing more wonderful in it than in the Growth and unfolding of any common Vegetable from &s;ome latent Principle or invi&s;ible Speck in the Seed, which not all the Optics and Gla&s;&s;es of a <HI>Galilaeo</HI> &s;hould be able to di&s;cover? Were
<PB N="307" REF="308">not the&s;e the known Facts of every Day and Hour, Incredulity would have laughed the Suppo&s;ition to nought. But, I think, I have got, about me, Something mo&s;t &s;urprizingly analagous and appo&s;ite to the Nature and Manner of our new Birth in <HI>Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> then put his Hand to his Pocket, and took out a Lump of Matter, in Form like a long and huge Maggot, evidently without Motion, apparently with|out Life, and hard and incru&s;ted all about to the Feeling.</P>
<P>What have you got there, my Friend, &s;aid the Earl? An old Worm, my Lord, that, at this In&s;tant, is pregnant with the Birth of a new Creature. Impo&s;&s;ible, cried the Earl, the Thing is ab&s;olutely dead. The Body of the old Worm is dead, indeed, my Lord; but there is certainly a Princi|ple of a new Life within it, that will &s;oon manife&s;t it&s;elf in the Birth of a very beau|tiful and wonderfully glorious Creature. And this you will find, if you leave it for a few Days where it may get the fo&s;tering Warmth of the Sun through one of your Windows. Have you ever &s;een the Fly they call the Dragon-Fly, my Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="309">
Yes, and have admired the Elegance of its Shape, the Mechani&s;m of its double Wings, and the Lu&s;tre of its Irradiations.</P>
<P>This Ma&s;s, my Lord, of apparently in|&s;en&s;ible Matter, is now actually pregnant with One of the &s;ame Species. The Pa|rent, through who&s;e Death it is to attain Life, was no Other, as you &s;ee, than a vile and groveling Maggot, who once fed and took its Delight in the Stench and Ordure of a Jakes. But the new Creature that is to be born from it will be quite of a diffe|rent Nature and Tendency. It will loath the Food and Occupation of its foul Proge|nitor. It will &s;oar &s;ublime over carnal and earthly Things. It will drink the Dews of Heaven, and feed on the con&s;ummate Nectar and Fragrance of Flowers.</P>
<P>This, indeed, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> rejoined the Earl, is to make the invi&s;ible Things of God vi&s;ible, even to the naked Eye, by the Things that are &s;een.</P>
<P>While my Lord and his Friend were thus deeply in Di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. <HI>John,</HI> the Hou&s;e-Steward, came in and told his Ma|&s;ter that One waited in the Hall with a Letter for him.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="310">
A Letter, cried the Earl, what can I have to &s;ay, <HI>John,</HI> to any Letters, or any of the Writers thereof? &mdash; But, &s;ome|thing is due to Humanity, and it &s;hall be paid; de&s;ire him to &s;tep in.</P>
<P>Hereupon a Stranger entered, who&s;e Figure in&s;tantly caught the Eyes and At|tention of the Earl and his Companion in an a&s;toni&s;hed Captivity. The Youth was dre&s;&s;ed in &s;imple Fu&s;tian; and his dark brown Locks, tied behind with a black Riband, flowed carele&s;ly between his Shoulders; while &s;ome of the front &s;tray|ing Curls, as in Sport, alternately &s;haded and di&s;covered a Part of his lovely Coun|tenance. He bowed, he moved Attracti|on; and gracefully advancing toward my Lord, he again bowed, laid a Letter be|fore him, on the Table, and then &s;ilently retired backward a few Steps.</P>
<P>They viewed him, they gazed upon him, as it had been the &s;udden Vi&s;ion of an Angel of Light. Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> was not able to utter a Word; neither had my Lord the Power to lay a Finger on the Pa|per that was directed to him; till Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> at la&s;t, giving a great Stroke on the Table, cried &s;uddenly out, I would lay a thou&s;and Pounds of it! It is He! it is he!
<PB N="310" REF="311">&mdash; My Heart tells me he can be no Other but your <HI>Harry Clinton!</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Harry</HI> &s;prung forward and, ca&s;ting him&s;elf precipitately at the Feet of the Earl, he cla&s;ped his Knees with an eager Reve|rence, crying, My Father, my honoured, my dear, my dear Father! and broke into Tears.</P>
<P>My Lord, all in a Tremor, attempted to rai&s;e him to his Arms; and <HI>Harry,</HI> per|ceiving this, ro&s;e and threw him&s;elf into the Bo&s;om of his Father. But the Earl gently and fondly put him off a little, and gazing intently at a Countenance that ap|peared to him lovely, above All that was lovely in the Circle of Creation, he gather|ed new Strength, and catching <HI>Harry</HI> to his Brea&s;t, he exclaimed in a Tran&s;port, <HI>Let me die, let me die, &s;ince I have &s;een thy Face, my Son!</HI></P>
