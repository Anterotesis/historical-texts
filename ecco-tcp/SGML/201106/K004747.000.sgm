<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of the following &s;heets is to direct a right u&s;e of tho&s;e medicines which are nece&s;&s;ary to be kept in families, who&s;e di&s;tance from a good practitioner, or any other cir|cum&s;tance, renders an immediate application in &s;udden illne&s;&s;es almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, and occa&s;ions tho&s;e delays in trifling complaints, which oftentimes prove of very bad con&s;equence. It has been found by experience, for want of proper hints and directions in re|&s;pect to the do&s;es of medicines, &s;everal fatal errors have been com|mitted, either from the ignorance of per&s;ons them&s;elves, or from being obliged to have recour&s;e, for want of better, to the advice of nur&s;es, and &s;uch good women, who&s;e greate&s;t &s;kill extends to the making a po&s;&s;et for a &s;weat, or a pla&s;ter for a &s;ore &s;hin.</P>
<P>THOSE captains of &s;hips who&s;e ve&s;&s;els are too &s;mall to allow of carrying a &s;urgeon, and gentlemen who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s may call them to take a long voyage in &s;uch &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, or to travel by land through unfrequented or poor places, or tho&s;e who are going to &s;ettle in any of his Maje&s;ty's plantations, will find a great advantage from being thus enabled to become their own phy&s;icians in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; and we often &s;ee that Nature, with a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will free the con&s;titution from di&s;orders which are not too deeply rooted, or very malignant in the fir&s;t attack. I would by no means be under|&s;tood to pretend that the medicines I here recommend, are infal|lible in the re&s;pective di&s;orders they are pre&s;cribed for, being for the mo&s;t part &s;uch only as are to be found in the di&s;pen&s;atory of the college of phy&s;icians; where I have been under a nece&s;&s;ity of compounding, I have attended to the practice of the principal phy|&s;icians in town, and a&s;&s;ume no further merit to my&s;elf than to care of &s;electing &s;uch medicines who&s;e operations are the lea&s;t dangerous. Thus far however I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that, by following the&s;e directions, which are plain and ea&s;y, and wrote in a &s;tile fitted to the meane&s;t capacity, per&s;picuity being always preferable to elegance in this kind of writing, the patient may, by
<PB N="iv" REF="4">applying what is nece&s;&s;ary in time, prevent tho&s;e ills that follow from neglect, which good nur&s;ing and a few innocent things might at fir&s;t remove.</P>
<P>THOSE who have a knowledge in phy&s;ic, and do not &s;tand in need of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will in the boxes find many u&s;eful medi|cines to be kept at hand, and may extend their practice, by giving me a catalogue of &s;uch others as they would chu&s;e to have added.</P>
<P>LADIES and gentlemen, who re&s;ide in the country, will hereby be enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t their poor neighbours; which many of them I doubt not would take a plea&s;ure in doing, did they but know what to apply.</P>
<P>WITH each box of medicines may be had a box of &s;cales and weights; each weight marked di&s;tinctly, that any per&s;on may at once adju&s;t the proper quantity for a do&s;e.</P>
<P>As many people may chu&s;e to keep by them what is proper for their own particular complaints, whom it may not &s;uit to have the box complete, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that any of the medicines here recommended may be had &s;eparate, or as many of them as agreeable, packed up in le&s;&s;er boxes for the conveniency of carriage.</P>

<HEAD>ASTHMATIC TINCTURE.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS tincture is of u&s;e in a difficulty of breathing, tightne&s;s acro&s;s the brea&s;t, and &s;hort coughs, parti|cularly if brought on by cold north-ea&s;terly winds, which frequently affect the brea&s;t, &s;ides, and lungs: it allays the cough, opens the che&s;t, and loo&s;ens the phlegm, &s;o that it ea&s;ily comes away; and frees the pores of the &s;kin which have been &s;hut up by the winds.</P>
<P>It may be taken as often as occa&s;ion requires, from thirty to &s;ixty or eighty drops, in a little<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 15.</NOTE> pectoral drink or barley water, with which you &s;hould dilute plentifully, drinking it of the &s;ame heat as you would a di&s;h of tea.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ASTRINGENT ELECTARY.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER be too ha&s;ty in the u&s;e of this electary; it is often found that a purging is the means made u&s;e of by Nature to carry off other complaints, or to free the body from bad humours, which might in time beget di&s;orders; now, by &s;topping this whole&s;ome
<PB N="2" REF="6">drain too &s;oon, the&s;e bad humours may be thrown back into the blood, and produce the wor&s;t con&s;equences: therefore you will &s;eldom or never err, by &s;uffering the purging, if not over violent, to continue two or three days, at the end of that time, &s;hould you find the patient weakened by it, or that it is really a di&s;order it|&s;elf, and not a cure for other di&s;orders, then you may give a do&s;e or two of rhubarb, and afterwards proceed to the u&s;e of the electa|ry: by the&s;e means you will clean&s;e the &s;tomach and bowels, and get rid of the complaint without any farther trouble.</P>
<P>Fluxes, which &s;eafaring people are &s;ubject to, are to be treated much in the &s;ame manner, but be very careful to clean&s;e the bowels fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Some of my friends who have been many years accu&s;tomed to the &s;ea, recommend the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 17.</NOTE> purging apozem before the u&s;e of a&s;trin|gents: they &s;ay it cools the body, and carries off every thing which is di&s;agreeable to the bowels, better than rhubarb, or any other purge. After having clean&s;ed the &s;tomach and bowels of the filth which occa&s;ioned the di&s;order, by the one or other of the&s;e means, you will find ipecacuanha given with the a&s;tringent electary in very &s;mall quantities, viz. from half a grain to one or two grains, of infinite &s;ervice; but this &s;hould be practi&s;ed only by tho&s;e who have &s;ome little knowledge in phy&s;ic, and they will have the &s;atisfaction to find the method here recommended will &s;eldom, if ever, fail of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>The common mixture to give it in may be made of three quarters of a pint of &s;pring water, and a quarter of a pint of good French brandy, &s;weetened with a bit of &s;ugar, a teacupful of which &s;hould be taken with each do&s;e; mix the powder in a little of it, and drink the remainder after it.</P>

<HEAD>ON BLEEDING.</HEAD>
<P>IRATHER chu&s;e to mention the complaints in which bleeding is advi&s;eable under this general head, than with the medicines for the re&s;pective di&s;orders, becau&s;e it may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed they cannot always procure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for which rea&s;on, di|recting to bleed before the u&s;e of the medicines, in ca&s;es where it might prove &s;erviceable, may be a means of preventing their admi|ni&s;tering tho&s;e remedies, which, taken in time, will frequently alone remove the complaints. Be&s;ides, I would not wi&s;h the un|&s;kilful to be too free with the lancet, as an injudicious evacuation of blood may be &s;ucceeded with very bad con&s;equences; and my in|tention through the whole, as I ob&s;erved in the preface, being no other than to &s;upply families with a few u&s;eful remedies for &s;light indi&s;po&s;itions, by which they may frequently prevent tedious ill|ne&s;&s;es, but not to put the unexperienced upon trifling with them|&s;elves when they are really ill, and can have proper advice.</P>
<P>Blood &s;hould be taken away in the beginning of fevers, when there is a &s;trong, quick pul&s;e, the eyes red and fiery, with great heat and thir&s;t; but never when they are in the decline, as, from being inflammatory, they are often at this period degenerated into the nevous kind, when the chief of the affair is to be ma|naged by the frequent application of bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>In a&s;thmatical complaints, if the patient be of a full habit of body.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="33">
<P>In coughs, if the pul&s;e is quick and full, with an oppre&s;&s;ion at the brea&s;t, or difficulty in breathing.</P>
<P>In colics, where the pain is violent, the bowels inflamed, and no &s;tools.</P>
<P>In fits, if the &s;pirits are hurried and overpowered, and the patient full of blood.</P>
<P>In &s;wimmings, dizzine&s;s, and pains of the head.</P>
<P>In &s;titches, and pleuritic di&s;orders of the &s;ide and brea&s;t, particu|larly if it gives pain to take a deep breath.</P>
<P>In &s;ore throats, where there is a &s;trong, quick pul&s;e, and the throat greatly &s;welled and inflamed.</P>
<P>For the piles it is &s;ometimes &s;erviceable; as likewi&s;e in female ob&s;tructions, and frequently in rheumatic complaints; in apoplec|tic di&s;orders, a dy&s;entery or bloody flux, and irk&s;ome heat of the bowels; for the hooping cough, particularly if of a full habit of bo|dy, and the phlegm which is brought up appears &s;treaked with blood; in all of which ca&s;es, the quantity taken away mu&s;t be proportioned to the age of the patient, and the violence of the complaint.</P>
<P>Bleeding again ought to be directed in large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es or &s;wellings, where the heat and pain is immoderate; for in the&s;e ca&s;es, by draw|ing blood, the matter is more ea&s;ily and &s;peedily brought to ripen, and by that means the body more effectually freed from its di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>In a word, wherever prevail &s;ore eyes, &s;ciatica or hip gout, a dry hu&s;ky cough, an head-ach, pains of the womb or of the bladder, dry gripes, &s;trangury, gravel, pain from the &s;tone, violent bleedings of the no&s;e, ears, or other parts, an inveterate &s;corbutical itch, and the like, opening a vein is of peculiar &s;ervice; but in drop&s;ies, a jaundice, the gout, and all illne&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned by a relaxed &s;tate of body, an impo|veri&s;hed blood, or too great weakne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, you mu&s;t &s;eek re|lief from the medicines recommended in this little manual, and not, by an abrupt and prepo&s;terous u&s;e of bleeding, increa&s;e the di&s;order, and ruin the health of the patient and your own reputation.</P>

<PB N="30" REF="34">
<HEAD>ON THE APPLICATION OF BLISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>TO the cautions here laid down with re&s;pect to bleeding, I &s;hall add a word or two concerning the application of bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t excellent remedy may be pro&s;tituted by an incon&s;ide|rate, ra&s;h, and fooli&s;h practice; which, it is plain, oftentimes hap|pens with regard to bli&s;ters, by ordering them indi&s;criminately in all &s;evers, and without di&s;tinction in any time of the di&s;temper, which can only be the effect of ignorance.</P>
<P>Therefore, before we re&s;olve on an expedient of this nature, it would be convenient to con&s;ider whether the fever be of the in|flammatory or nervous kind; if of the former, in&s;tead of bli&s;tering the lancet ought to be u&s;ed, and a mild cooling regimen &s;et on &s;oot, as already directed; this will moderate the heat of the blood, and by degrees re&s;tore it to its due temper. On the other hand, in fevers of the nervous cla&s;s, where the &s;ymptoms are quite dif|ferent, the pul&s;e being low and weak, the &s;pirits almo&s;t &s;pent, and the eyes, in&s;tead of appearing &s;parkling, red and fiery, grown quite dim, we ought by all means to make u&s;e of bli&s;ters, and that freely.</P>
<P>They are oftentimes proper in paralytic and nervous complaints, as likewi&s;e in rheumatic pains and pleuri&s;ies, in which ca&s;es a bli&s;|ter applied immediately upon the part affected frequently affords great relief; and, and in a variety of other ca&s;es they are of infinite
<PB N="31" REF="35">&s;ervice; but then regard mu&s;t be paid to the &s;tate of the patient's blood, for if a full, quick pul&s;e, great heat, thir&s;t, and the other &s;ymptoms of an inflammatory fever attend upon the di&s;orders, the fever mu&s;t fir&s;t be conquered, and afterwards, if nece&s;&s;ity requires it, let bli&s;ters be applied. Should they cau&s;e a &s;trangury, which will &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e, give the patient plentifully of mar&s;hmallow drink, or barley water with a little gum arabic di&s;&s;olved in it; or if there is a purging, which you would wi&s;h to be &s;topped, of the hart&s;horn drink, and this inconvenience will &s;oon be remedied.</P>
<P>In regard to the management of them, the pla&s;ter &s;hould be &s;pread upon a piece of an old glove, and bound on to the part intended; after twenty-four hours, the &s;trength of the flies being pretty well &s;pent, you may remove the bli&s;ter, and, if you cannot procure the proper dre&s;&s;ings, a little Turner's cerate &s;pread upon a piece of fine rag may &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>Should any bli&s;ters appear unbroke, &s;nip them with a pair of &s;ci&s;|&s;ars; if they give violent pain, this may be done when the pla&s;ter has been applied only twelve hours; when, by di&s;charging the wa|ter, and laying it &s;mooth on again, you ea&s;e the patient, and give the bli&s;ter an opportunity of acting more.</P>
