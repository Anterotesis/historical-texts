<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t volume of the "Memoirs of the Medical Society of London," I de&s;cribed &s;ome of the unhappy effects of the too free indulgence of &s;trong liquors. My opinions have been di&s;&s;eminated by in&s;ertion into many public prints, both at home and abroad; and I have rea&s;on to conclude, have been productive of e&s;&s;ential benefit to the community. To render this benefit &s;till more exten&s;ive, I have reprinted that part of the original e&s;&s;ay, more immediately applicable to the pernicious u&s;e of the&s;e liquors, to which I have added &s;ome farther cautions; and likewi&s;e a moral and phy&s;ical
<PB N="ii" REF="3">Thermometer, the hint of which was &s;ugge&s;ted by a friend abroad. It is formed to convey, by a glance of the eye, the &s;entiments I wi&s;h to impre&s;s upon the reader.</P>
<P>LONDON, April 1789.</P>
<P>JOHN COAKLEY LETTSOM.</P>
<P><HI>This little Performance was originally printed to give away; but the Demands be|coming very numerous, I have applied it to the Benefit of the</HI> PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY, <HI>in&s;titued "for the Prevention of Crimes, and for a Reform in the Manners of the ri&s;ing Poor."</HI></P>
<P>The general Outlines of the Plan adopted by the Society, are to take mi&s;erable and de&s;titute Children from poor depraved Parents, and from the re&s;orts of wicked People, to cloath, feed, and educate them as Orphans; and thus by a total &s;e|paration from their abominable connections, and a redemption from the lowe&s;t depths of di&s;tre&s;s, to re&s;tore them to civil community, to which they were either lo&s;t, or known only as its burthens, nui&s;ances, and plunderers.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH this Society has been but a few months e&s;tabli&s;hed, there are already placed under the care of proper per&s;ons, in hired hou&s;es, conveniently &s;ituated at HACKNEY, &s;everal Children of both &s;exes, who a few weeks &s;ince were inhabi|tants of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable abodes of vice and want; but are now enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of a new life, heightened by the pro&s;pects of acquiring an honourable &s;upport by their own indu&s;try.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF HARD DRINKING.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER introducing the want of appetite for food ari&s;ing from the indulgence of drinking &s;trong liquors, I cannot well di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, without adverting more fully to its painful influence upon the con&s;titution, which I have ob&s;erved with more anxiety, as the &s;ufferers are often tho&s;e of the more delicate part of the female &s;ex, who&s;e habits of intemperance are not unfrequently intro|duced by tho&s;e who &s;hould have been the guardians of their health.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;eries entailed by the&s;e indulgences, differ much as to their progre&s;s and violence, and even the
<PB N="2" REF="5">&s;ymptoms vary &s;o much, as to admit of obvious di&s;|tinctions.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> I &s;hall notice, as being generally le&s;s painful, though equally permanent, are the &s;ymptoms more e&s;pecial|ly attendant on per&s;ons who have, early in life, habituated them&s;elves to drink freely of wine of various kinds, and from their &s;ituations in life, undergone a change of climate, as from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> &amp;c. Punch-drinkers, likewi&s;e, have been liable to &s;imilar complaints. The fir&s;t appear|ance of di&s;ea&s;e is lo&s;s of appetite, which at length is &s;o weakened and vitiated,, that after taking food, before the return of the next meal, a kind of heavy pain of the &s;to|mach, with a con&s;triction of the mu&s;cles of the abdomen, come on, and with a &s;light effort, a &s;weeti&s;h, bracki&s;h, or acid fluid, is thrown up, and the pain and con&s;triction for a &s;hort time &s;ub&s;ide. For &s;everal years in this unhappy &s;tate, the patient drags on a life, rendered now and then more &s;upportable, either by renewed potations, or exputations, till at length the bodily and mental powers become impaired: the object grows emaciated, the whole body &s;hrinks; nei|ther &s;welling nor drop&s;y appear, though the countenance looks &s;allow; the region of the liver is not enlarged, and the liver it&s;elf &s;eems le&s;s than natural: the urine is not very high coloured; the <HI>faeces</HI> are hard and dark-coloured; the &s;tomach will take and retain food, but after receiving it,
<PB N="3" REF="6">it is oppre&s;&s;ed, and feels tightened or contracted in its dimen&s;ions; the patient expre&s;&s;es it, as if it were tied by a &s;traight bandage; the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation affects the inte&s;tines, and the abdomen &s;uffers &s;uch irregular con&s;trictions, as become evident to the external touch, the mu&s;cles being drawn into irregular action, the &s;urface of the belly is di|ver&s;ified with protuberances and cavities: &s;ometimes the &s;pa&s;modic &s;trictures run tran&s;ver&s;ely, and rai&s;e this &s;urface like waves of the &s;ea. The pain continues increa&s;ing to &s;uch exce&s;s, that the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer is obliged to pre&s;s again&s;t a table or &s;ome hard body, to mitigate his di&s;tre&s;s, till vomiting brings a re&s;pite; or he ha&s;tens this operation, by thru&s;ting his finger into the throat; and thus relieves him&s;elf till the next reception of nouri&s;hment, when the &s;ame tragedy is repeated. The matter di&s;charged is thin, acrid, &s;our, &s;weet, or bracki&s;h. Sometimes, in&s;tead of con&s;tipa|tion, an occa&s;ional purging en&s;ues, and mitigates the pain, whil&s;t it &s;ubdues the con&s;titution; and after years of mi&s;ery, the victim &s;lides into a fatal decay; but long before this, the powers of the mind have been debilitated, and its recol|lection and actions impaired.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> train of di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ymptoms which I &s;hall relate, more generally &s;ucceed the free u&s;e of &s;pirits, or of wines with the admixture of &s;pirits, as Madeira; and e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="4" REF="7">where late hours and illicit amours have been &s;uperadded.</P>
<P>THE early &s;ymptoms of complaint are, a pain and oppre&s;|&s;ion about the pit of the &s;tomach after eating, or di&s;ten&s;ion from fluids; this pain extends to the brea&s;t and &s;houlders; there are frequent eructations of wind, which &s;eem to burn the throat as they a&s;cend; the&s;e &s;ymptoms, which are u&s;ual in affections of the liver, and particularly in bilious effu&s;ions, are at fir&s;t &s;o trivial, as &s;eldom to alarm the fears of the patient, or he &s;lightly mentions them as &s;ymptoms of the gout, whil&s;t he attempts to avert the pre&s;ent &s;uffering, by indulging more freely in the very cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief, till repeated fillips of raw &s;pirits, or a dilution of the poi&s;on, render exi&s;tence mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>THE appetite now totally fails, but an in&s;atiable thir&s;t con|tinues, and if it be not &s;upplied with an exhilarating cordial, the vital &s;pirits in&s;tantly flag, and &s;uch horrors take place as are dreadful even to a bye-&s;tander; the poor victim is &s;o de|pre&s;&s;ed, as to fancy a thou&s;and imaginary evils; he expects momentarily to expire, and &s;tarts up &s;uddenly from his &s;eat; walks wildly about the room; breathes &s;hort, and &s;eems to &s;truggle for breath; if the&s;e horrors &s;eize him in bed, when waking from &s;lumber, he &s;prings up like an ela&s;tic body, with a &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation, and the horrors of fright|ful
<PB N="5" REF="8">objects around him; at the &s;ame time the pain of the &s;tomach continues and augments; the fight of whole&s;ome plain food gives di&s;gu&s;t, in&s;tead of appetite; drink is his cry; or if hunger is excited, it is after high-&s;ea&s;oned, &s;alt, or acrid nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>AT this time, if a drop&s;y, or fatal jaundice, do not terminate exi&s;tence, the legs &s;hrink, are &s;warthy-coloured like the re&s;t of the body, and &s;ometimes purple &s;pots appear and di&s;appear for many months; the extremities feel &s;ore to the touch, and upon &s;cratching them, exude blood: the thighs likewi&s;e &s;hrink; but the body, and particularly about the re|gion of the liver, enlarges, and the hardne&s;s of the liver may be frequently traced: the face is nearly copper-coloured, is emaciated, &s;ometimes with little &s;uppurations, which dry and turn &s;caly; the breath &s;mells like rotten apples, and the <HI>morbus niger,</HI> or vomitings of a fluid like that of coffee-grounds, &s;natch the patient from complicated mi&s;ery. Some|times a purging, or bloody di&s;charges, ha&s;ten the cata|&s;trophe.</P>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> train of &s;ymptoms to be de&s;cribed, is not con|&s;ined to age or &s;ex, but is in general more frequently the attendant of the female &s;ex.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons liable to the &s;ymptoms, have been tho&s;e of
<PB N="6" REF="9">delicate habits, who have endeavoured to overcome the nervous debility, by the aid of &s;pirits: many of the&s;e have begun the u&s;e of the&s;e poi&s;ons from per&s;ua&s;ion of their utili|ty, rather than from the love of them: the relief, however, being temporary, to keep up their effects, frequent acce&s;s is had to the &s;ame delu&s;ion, till at length what was taken by compul&s;ion, gains attachment, and a little drop of brandy, or gin and water, becomes as nece&s;&s;ary as food; the female &s;ex, from natural delicacy, acquire this cu&s;tom by &s;low de|grees, and the poi&s;on being admitted in &s;mall do&s;es, is &s;low in its operations, but not le&s;s painful in its effects.</P>
<P>THE &s;oberer cla&s;s of trade&s;men, al&s;o, who occa&s;ionally in|dulge in their &s;ixpenny-worth of brandy and water, gradually &s;lide into the &s;ame unhappy habits, and entail upon their con&s;titutions the &s;ame mi&s;ery, which I &s;hall now introduce.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t appearance of indi&s;po&s;ition very much re&s;embles what has been la&s;t de&s;cribed; and under the deception of the gout, the fuel is heaped upon the fire, till the delu&s;ion has been too long maintained to admit of retreat: in general, at lea&s;t, the attachment to the u&s;e of &s;pirituous drinks, be|comes &s;o predominant, that neither threats nor per&s;ua&s;ions are powerful enough to overcome it. The mi&s;erable &s;ufferer is &s;o infatuated, as, in &s;pite of locks and keys, to bribe by high rewards the dependent nur&s;e, privately to procure it.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<P>BUT the concluding &s;ymptoms are very different from either of the foregoing hi&s;tories: frequently, indeed, the appetite for food vani&s;hes, but &s;ometimes continues vora|cious; and, at the &s;ame time, whil&s;t the body is co&s;tive, and no vomiting en&s;ues, the lower extremities grow more and more emaciated; the legs become as &s;mooth as poli&s;hed ivory, and the &s;oles of the feet even gla&s;&s;y and &s;hining, and at the &s;ame time &s;o tender, that the weight of the finger excites &s;hrieks and moaning; and yet I have known, that in a mo|ment's time, heavy pre&s;&s;ure has given no unea&s;ine&s;s. The legs, and the whole lower extremities, lo&s;e all power of ac|tion; wherever they are placed, there they remain till moved again by the attendant; the arms and hands acquire the &s;ame pal&s;ied &s;tate, and the patients are rendered incapable of feeding them&s;elves. Thus for years they exi&s;t, with no material alteration in the &s;ize of the body, or a&s;pect of the countenance.</P>
<P>WHETHER they really undergo the agonies they appear to &s;uffer, I much doubt, as at this period their minds appear idioti&s;h: they often &s;hriek out with a vehemence that may be heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, but upon enquiring about the &s;eat of pain, they have been vague and indeci&s;ive in their an&s;wers. When a cramp comes on the lower ex|tremities, involuntary motions draw up the legs, and produce the mo&s;t piercing &s;hrieks: and the features of the face, al|tered
<PB N="8" REF="11">by convul&s;ive twitchings, excite pain in a &s;pectator. For &s;ome months before they die, the&s;e &s;hrieks are more in|ce&s;&s;ant, and as violent as the &s;trength will admit.</P>
<P>THEY talk freely in the intervals of mitigation, but of things that do not exi&s;t; they de&s;cribe the pre&s;ence of their friends, as if they &s;aw realities, and rea&s;on tolerably clear upon fal&s;e premi&s;es.</P>
<P>MOSTLY before they die, they take le&s;s food; &s;ometimes a purging &s;ucceeds, of a thin &s;ub&s;tance, and of a dark green colour; &s;ometimes a vomiting of black matter; but mo&s;t generally they gradually &s;ink from the accumulation of pain and debility. There is rarely any fever. They do not, as in the preceding &s;tate, fall into drop&s;ies, but u&s;ually become paralytic: the breath is not offen&s;ive, nor is there the &s;ame difficulty of breathing, or horror of &s;uffocation: whether the imperceptible and gradual augmentation in the u&s;e of &s;pirits, is the cau&s;e of this difference, I am not certain; but the difference is con&s;iderable, as mu&s;t appear from their hi&s;tories, which I have drawn from actual ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I WOULD not, however, infer, that every &s;pirit-drinker acquires the &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;e above related, or that other
<PB N="9" REF="12">di&s;ea&s;es do not more frequently &s;ucceed this dangerous habit: liver di&s;ea&s;es, of various kinds, it is well known, u&s;ually re&s;ult from intemperance, and drop&s;ies often &s;ucceed; but from &s;ome circum&s;tances in the con&s;titution, or from the mode of indulgence in liquors, the &s;ymptoms I have de|&s;cribed have &s;everally occurred where no drop&s;ical affec|tions have &s;upervened. There is &s;omething in &s;prituous liquors, &s;o injurious to the human frame, that too much at|tention cannot be paid in di&s;couraging the u&s;e of them. Many of the unhappy victims I have attended, a&s;cribe their &s;ufferings to the unguarded advice of &s;ome medical practi|tioner, who has, under the idea of wine turning &s;our on the &s;tomach, permitted a little drop of brandy and water to be &s;ub&s;tituted; &s;eldom, indeed, a day pa&s;&s;es without introducing me to the &s;ick bed of &s;ome deluded object of mi&s;ery; and it is from the mo&s;t decided conviction of the injury, that I would guard every per&s;on from beginning with even a little drop of this fa&s;cinating poi&s;on, which once admitted, is &s;eldom, if ever, afterwards overcome. Whenever I hear the patient plead for &s;ome &s;ub&s;titute for beer or wine, under the &s;uppo|&s;ition of their turning &s;our, my fears are alarmed, and my endeavours excited, to pluck the un&s;u&s;picious patient from the brink of de&s;truction; this plea is never made, till the exhilarating influence of &s;pirit has been experienced; and not a moment &s;hould be lo&s;t, in warning &s;uch objects of their danger.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
<P>SOME, who avoid brandy, have been induced to take rum, from a vulgar opinion, that it is more oily and bal&s;amic; the argument is erroneous, for what bal&s;amic qualities can empyreumatic oil contain? Others, who condemn both brandy and rum, make no objection to gin, becau&s;e they think it diuretic; but &s;o far from it, that half the drop&s;ies among the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people originate, or, at lea&s;t, are confirmed by the u&s;e of this &s;pirit; they are all poi&s;ons, and are nearly alike deleterious.</P>
<P>WHEN the effects of &s;pirits on the con&s;titution, have not greatly contaminated it, beyond the frequent recurrence of &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting; after interdicting &s;pirits altogether, the patient &s;hould be allowed to fix upon &s;ome one &s;pecies of nutriment; and, whatever it is, &s;hould be confined to it alone, and that in the &s;malle&s;t quantities po&s;&s;ible, and at re|gular &s;tated di&s;tances, that the preceding portion may be properly dige&s;ted, before any addition be allowed: when the &s;tomach has thus acquired more tone, either &s;ome new, or an increa&s;e of the former nutriment, may be admitted.</P>
<P>I ONCE attended a lady, who could not retain any food on the &s;tomach above an hour or two. I reque&s;ted her to fix upon &s;ome light nouri&s;hment that &s;he could palate, and &s;he mentioned milk: I then re&s;trained her to four table-&s;poonfuls of it every &s;ix hours, and afterwards increa&s;ed the quantity
<PB N="11" REF="14">as the &s;tomach could bear it. From this &s;he went to broth, and thus gradually acquired &s;uch a &s;tate of the &s;tomach, as to bear the u&s;ual food of the family; and for four years pa&s;t &s;he has enjoyed good health, with the moderate u&s;e of a gla&s;s of wine, or beer, but not one drop of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>BUT in &s;ome ca&s;es, where the habit of drams has been long continued, the total and &s;udden omi&s;&s;ion of them, has &s;unk the per&s;on into irretrievable debility. Here this pernicious cu&s;tom mu&s;t be left off gradually. A man who u&s;ually drank twelve drams a day, being convinced of his approach|ing mi&s;ery, took the re&s;olution to wean him&s;elf from this poi&s;on; he always drank out of one gla&s;s, into this he daily dropped a drop of &s;ealing-wax; by this means he had twelve drops le&s;s of &s;pirit every day, till, at length, his gla&s;s being filled with wax, his habit was cured.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame advantage has been obtained, by taking the dram, or gla&s;s of cordial, out of a quart bottle, which is to be repleni&s;hed each time with as much water, and by this means gradually diluting the remaining liquor, till its &s;trength becomes wholly &s;ubdued, and little more than the &s;ub&s;tituted water remains.</P>
<P>PAINFUL indeed is this truth, that when the indulgence in &s;pirituous liquors is rendered habitual, it is extremely dif|ficult
<PB N="12" REF="15">to overcome. Although the mi&s;erable object is per|&s;uaded, that it clouds his rea&s;on, debilitates his mental as well as corporeal faculties, debars him of all the cheerful gratifi|cations annexed to health and virtue; yet &s;o exce&s;&s;ive are the debility and tremors of the body&mdash;and &s;o horrid is the de&s;pondency of the mind after the exhilarating effects of the&s;e liquors have &s;ub&s;ided, that without a per&s;everance in determined efforts to vanqui&s;h this habit, a repetition of the delu&s;ive poi&s;on will be indulged, till re&s;olution is too tran|&s;ient and weak to enable the victim to &s;top at the precipice, which terminates his painful exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>MAY &s;uch, however, as have &s;trength of re&s;olution to re|flect upon their danger, be encouraged, by an a&s;&s;urance, that however great the debility may feel, and &s;trong the idea of di&s;&s;olution may appear, yet from mere debility alone, life is not in danger; and this is a certain fact, that the lon|ger and more frequently the evil habit is re&s;i&s;ted, that habit becomes le&s;s powerful, whil&s;t the &s;trength of the con&s;titution proportionally augments, and thereby renders the victory le&s;s difficult than might at fir&s;t appear; and what exertions are more intere&s;ting and worthy of a rational being, than tho&s;e which &s;ub&s;titute vigour and health of body, for agita|tion, tremor, and pain; and &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s of mind, for horror, de&s;pondency, and &s;uicide?</P>
