<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY Into the EXILITY of the VESSELS In a Human Body, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Structure of the Ani|mal Body, whether we con|&s;ider the Size, Situation and U&s;es of its larger and more complex Parts, with relation to each other, and their Sub&s;ervience to the whole, or by diving deeper into the &s;ecret and
<PB REF="8">more my&s;terious Parts of Nature, we &s;crutinize the &s;everal Parts of which the&s;e are compo&s;ed, exhibits to our View &s;uch an amazing Scene of un|bounded Power and Wi&s;dom, as in|finitely exceeds all the Contrivance of the re&s;t of the vi&s;ible Creation, how great the Bodies, or a&s;toni&s;hing &s;oever their Motions and Revolutions may upon a &s;trict Enquiry appear to us.</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. Ethic. lib. 5. cap. 1.</NOTE>.</Q>
<P>But tho' this Po&s;ition is &s;ufficiently evident from the Structure of every Organ in the Animal Body, yet it is in no Part &s;o &s;ingularly a&s;toni&s;hing, as in the Growth of Animals, from their fir&s;t original Stamina in the Ani|malcule,
<PB N="3" REF="9">till they arrive at their ap|pointed Size.</P>
<P>That every Ve&s;&s;el and Fibre in the Body is contained in Miniature in an Animalcule, few, I believe, will di&s;|pute, it being ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that mere Matter and Motion, with|out its being conducted by the Ve&s;&s;els proper to an Animal, &s;hould produce an Animal at all; and &s;till more ab|&s;urd, if there can be Degrees in Ab|&s;urdity, to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Cau&s;e ca|pable of producing that Variety of Species, in their regular Order, which, we &s;ee, is con&s;tantly kept up thro' &s;o great a Series of Years and Genera|tions; but that in&s;tead of a Calf, a Cow might as naturally produce a Lion, Camel, or any other Creature,
<PB N="4" REF="10">as frequently as its own proper Spe|cies.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, could the Parts or Limbs, or even the mo&s;t minute Organ be produced by the Motion of the Fluids, without their being conducted by the Ve&s;&s;els of the Organ it&s;elf already latent in the Stamina, what &s;hould hinder, why any Part taken away by Amputation &s;hould not again be perfectly formed and re&s;tored, &s;ince all the adductory Ve&s;&s;els continue in their former State, and are capable of &s;upplying the &s;ame Fluids as be|fore? Con&s;equently &s;ince the mo&s;t minute Organ cannot be &s;upplied by any other than the forementioned Method, can any thing be &s;o ab&s;urd, as to &s;uppo&s;e that all the regular Or|der
<PB N="5" REF="11">of Ve&s;&s;els nece&s;&s;ary to compo&s;e the whole Bodily Machine &s;hould be pro|duced by &s;uch a Cau&s;e, as is utterly incapable of forming the lea&s;t Part imaginable in a regular Manner? This is no le&s;s exemplified in the Seeds or proper Embryos of Plants. Thus the Seed of the Fir-tree, who&s;e Bulk with all its Integuments &s;carce equals the Head of the &s;malle&s;t Pin, has its Fibres and Ve&s;&s;els &s;o enlarged by the Addition of fre&s;h Particles, as to grow to an enormous Size, without ever de|viating (in whatever Soil it grows) from its own Species into any other kind of Tree. Which can be owing to no other Cau&s;e than the original Stamina latent in its Seed; which not only &s;eparate, but conduct the Parti|cles proper for its Nouri&s;hment, each
<PB N="6" REF="12">to its proper Place in a manner pecu|liar to it&s;elf, thereby di&s;tingui&s;hing it from all other Vegetables of what kind &s;oever. But a Branch once lop|ped off can no more be re&s;tored by the Gardener's Art, than an amputa|ted Limb by the Surgeon's: 'Tis true, indeed, new Buds may be thru&s;t forth by the redundant Nouri&s;hment, both in the adjacent and more remote Parts, to compen&s;ate in &s;ome mea&s;ure this Defect: but whether this Mutila|tion of the Plant be of its Summit, or of a lateral Branch, the Extremity mu&s;t &s;hrivel and dry up, and will bud and blo&s;&s;om no more.</P>
<P>If therefore mere Matter, altho' &s;uppo&s;ed to be in Motion, mu&s;t be thus conducted by the Ve&s;&s;els of an
<PB N="7" REF="13">Animal, it mu&s;t be conducted by the Animal it&s;elf, no Application of dif|ferent Forces <HI>ab extra</HI> to the Ve&s;&s;els (was there any &s;uch thing, as it is evi|dent from the Structure of the Uterus, there is not) being capable of regula|ting and directing &s;uch an innumera|ble Variety of Motions, or indeed of contributing to its Operations, any farther than &s;upplying it with a pro|per Nidus, and furni&s;hing it with Materials ready prepared for the Pur|po&s;e, as &s;ufficiently appears, not only from the Ob&s;ervations of the accurate Malpighi, Bellini, Redi, Merian and others, but di&s;covers it&s;elf to our Sen|&s;es, in the Generation of innumerable other Species of Animals, &s;ome depo|&s;iting their Eggs on Vegetables, or in the Earth, to be brought to Light by
<PB N="8" REF="14">the genial Warmth of the Sun, others in Dunghills, and other putrefying Sub&s;tances, and others in Streams of Water, where it is impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;uch Force to be applied.</P>
<P>Hence then Nutrition mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t not only in the mere Di&s;ten&s;ion, but in the Appo&s;ition of new Particles into &s;uch Parts of the Animal Body, as by the Enlargement of the Pores, and Vacuities in the Solids, are fitted to receive them, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn by Experiment
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Sect. 7. Exp. 11. of an Experimental Enquiry on &s;ome Parts of the Animal Structure.</NOTE>: And, in|deed, was it otherwi&s;e, the Animal would have a Power of making its own Fibres and Ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;e|quently of producing it&s;elf; nay the
<PB N="9" REF="15">Circulation of the Fluids mu&s;t be per|formed in Ve&s;&s;els, before the Ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves, thro' which it is to be conveyed, have a Being; which are &s;uch Ab&s;urdities, as I &s;hall not give my&s;elf the Trouble of confuting.</P>
<P>That the&s;e new Particles by adhe|ring firmly to the original Stamina in|crea&s;e the Bulk of the Animal, till &s;uch time as it arrives at the Perfec|tion its Structure is capable of, needs no Proof; but that the Strength of the original Animal owes its gradual Improvement to the &s;ame Cau&s;e, is likewi&s;e evident from the common Practice of &s;everal of our mechanic Workmen, who by &s;teeping and &s;atu|rating porous Woods, or the like light and brittle Sub&s;tances in glutinous
<PB N="10" REF="16">Decoctions, va&s;tly increa&s;e their na|tural Strength, without any Addition to their external Bulk, which would be &s;till farther increa&s;ed, was that al&s;o enlarged by a regular Di&s;ten&s;ion of Parts, as in the Ca&s;e of Animal Bodies.</P>
<P>Hence then it will follow, that the&s;e adventitious Particles, which by their Cohe&s;ion with the original Sta|mina, increa&s;e the Bulk and Strength of the Body, and thereby enable it to perform the proper Offices, for which it was created, are not really any Part of the Body it&s;elf, but extraneous to it, actuated and regulated intirely by it, and con&s;equently contribute no farther to its exerci&s;ing the Powers, it is de&s;igned to exert when perfect, than would be performed by a &s;trong
<PB N="11" REF="17">Lever acting with &s;uch a Power, as would be impo&s;&s;ible for a weak one to &s;u&s;tain, tho' in all other Re&s;pects the Ca&s;e might be exactly parallel.</P>
<P>Nor is this le&s;s true with regard to the Sen&s;ations, than Strength of the Body. A proper Ten&s;ion in the nervous Fibres being as requi&s;ite in this Ca&s;e, as Strength in tho&s;e de&s;ign|ed for Mu&s;cular Motion, as appears from the pernicious Effects of too great Laxity, as well as Rigidity, in &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es, the one rendering the Sen|&s;ations &s;o languid and &s;low thro' their weak Vibrations, as not to affect the Animal with &s;ufficient Force and Vi|vacity; whil&s;t the other, thro' too great Stiffne&s;s and Inflexibility, &s;carce allows them to vibrate at all, as is the
<PB N="12" REF="18">Ca&s;e in old Age; or la&s;tly by being too &s;pringy and ela&s;tic, and thence exciting too &s;trong and frequent Vi|brations in &s;uch as are younger, ei|ther renders their Sen&s;ations painful and unea&s;y, or &s;o quick in their Suc|ce&s;&s;ions to each other, as to prove u&s;ele&s;s, nay often prejudicial to the Animal, as is the Ca&s;e in Phren&s;ies, Maniacal Per&s;ons, and the like.</P>
<P>How far the Strength of the Body depends upon the adventitious Parti|cles derived to it by Nutrition has been explained above, and it is hence no le&s;s evident, that they cannot po&s;|&s;ibly contribute farther to its Sen&s;a|tions, than as they add &s;uch a Degree of Firmne&s;s, as may prevent any ex|ternal Species from acting upon the
<PB N="13" REF="19">nervous Fibrils &s;o forcibly, as to in|jure them; whil&s;t at the &s;ame time by their intimate Adhe&s;ion with the original &s;en&s;itive Organs, they cannot act upon the one, without exciting a proper Degree of Motion in the other; and con&s;equently the real Sen&s;itive Part of an Animal can contain no greater Quantity of Matter, than is included in the Nervous Parts of the Animalcule.</P>
<P>This then being the State of an Animal when arrived at its Perfection, how amazing mu&s;t it be to con&s;ider, how &s;mall and weak Organs do really actuate the whole Machine! But that this may more fully appear, and al&s;o afford us &s;ome determinate Idea of their extream Tenuity, I &s;hall endea|vour
<PB N="14" REF="20">to reduce &s;uch Micro&s;copical Ob|&s;ervations as are of be&s;t Credit to a cer|tain Standard; that by comparing them with each other, and reducing them to Numbers, our Notions of them may not be altogether &s;o vague and indeterminate as at pre&s;ent they are.</P>
<P><HI>Leeuwenhoek,</HI> that curious and di|ligent Inquirer into tho&s;e Works of Nature, which till his Time had by their Minutene&s;s e&s;caped all Di&s;cove|ry, has by his repeated Micro&s;copical Ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Semen Ma&s;culi|num</HI> of Animals, not only &s;hewn, that it abounds with Animalcula proper to each Species, but that, according to his Judgment, a thou&s;and of them would &s;carce be equal in Thickne&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="21">to a Grain of Sand
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leeuwenhoek</HI> Epi&s;t. 41. Tom. IV.</NOTE>; and con&s;e|quently that a cubical Inch would contain a thou&s;and Millions of Mil|lions of the&s;e little Beings. Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Keil</HI> indeed, in his elegant Inquiry into the actual Divi&s;ibility of the Particles of Matter, has from a Principle of Dioptrics computed their Magnitude to be &s;omewhat greater than that ju&s;t now mention|ed; but he has however demon|&s;trably &s;hewn, that the Length of a &s;ingle Animalculum cannot po&s;&s;i|bly exceed the 3&divisor;100000^t^h Part of an Inch
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Introductio ad veram Phy&s;icam,</HI> p. 48.</NOTE>. That our pre&s;ent Enquiry may therefore be wholly confined within the Limits of Truth, rather than proceed upon probable Conjec|ture,
<PB N="16" REF="22">we will make Choice of this latter E&s;timate, and for the further Conveniency of Calculation, take it for granted, that when the Foot is decimally divided, even &s;uch a Cubi|cal Inch will exceed the Bulk of a &s;ingle Animalculum, in no greater a Proportion, than that of a thou&s;and Millions of Millions to 27.</P>
<P>Now the &s;pecific Weight of the various Parts of an Animal Body re|duced to a Medium amounts to a lit|tle more than the Weight of an equal Bulk of Water; if therefore we &s;uppo&s;e one of the&s;e Animalcula to be to Wa|ter, as the other Parts of young Ani|mals are, (and greater it cannot be, as appears from what I have el&s;ewhere demon&s;trated with relation to the in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="23">&s;pecific Gravity in the Arte|ries of aged Animals
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5. Exp. 11. of an Experimental Enquiry on &s;ome Parts of the Animal Structure.</NOTE>, it follows, that as a Cubical Inch of Water is equivalent to 0.5271 parts of an Ounce Troy, the Weight of a &s;ingle Animalcule will be equal to the 1&divisor;140391450739^t^h part of a Grain nearly.</P>
<P>But by the Experiments of the in|genious Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> it appears, that in a Man of 12 Stone-weight, the Fluids are to the Solids when taken at a Me|dium, at the lea&s;t in the Proportion of 8 to 3
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;&s;ays on &s;everal Parts of the Animal O Economy,</HI> p. 38. <HI>to</HI> 63.</NOTE>, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e, which by the Help of Fire and a Chymical Proce&s;s may be extracted without the De&s;truction of a &s;ingle Fibre, which amounts to no &s;mall Quantity. It has
<PB N="18" REF="24">al&s;o been farther &s;hewn by Experi|ment, that the Ve&s;&s;els in young Ani|mals bear a much le&s;s Proportion to their Cavities, than the like Ve&s;&s;els in old ones of the &s;ame Species bear to theirs
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Sect. 3. Exp. 11 <HI>of the Experimental Enquiry,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>; con&s;equently, &s;ince the Den&s;ity of any Body is as the Weight of the Body directly, and its Magni|tude inver&s;ely, we &s;hall find, by com|paring the foregoing Proportions of the Fluids and Solids together in each different State of the Animal, as well before its Birth, as after it has arrived at full Maturity, that all the Stamina, from which &s;o noble a Being as Man him&s;elf was at fir&s;t derived, could not contain &s;o much &s;olid Matter as would be equal in Bulk, to that of a Quan|tity of Water, of no greater a Weight
<PB N="19" REF="25">than the 1&divisor;92408129934910602442073752000^t^h part of a Grain.</P>
<P>If the preceding Exility of the Solids in general be &s;o &s;urpizingly &s;mall, That of the Sen&s;itive Parts alone, could their Relation to the re&s;t be once adju&s;ted, would doubtle&s;s, to &s;peak in the Language of the Mathe|maticians, appear a mere Infinite&s;imal. For even <HI>Leeuwenhoek</HI> has declared in expre&s;s Words, that <Q>"<HI>Hae Cerebri Fibrillae, tenuibus puto amiciuntur Membranulis, quae ob in&s;ignem Exilitatem nunquam &s;e&s;e nuda|bunt con&s;pectui no&s;tro: Quod ni&s;i &s;tatuamus, quo pacto Fibrillarum Di&s;parationem vel Di&s;tinctionem Oculis a&s;&s;equeremur?</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leeuwenhoek</HI> Epi&s;t. 34. Tom. IV.</NOTE>"</Q> To
<PB N="20" REF="26">which he might have added our Intel|lectual Faculties al&s;o, it being &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to conceive Fibres always growing and encrea&s;ing in Bulk, &s;hould be kept &s;eparate, and perform their various Operations, but mu&s;t &s;oon prove immoveable, without be|ing divided from each other by the&s;e &s;lender Partitions.</P>
<P>This is not only evident from the Nature of the Fibres, but demon&s;tra|ble from Fact in the larger Parts even of full-grown Animals; which, when contiguous and deprived of their proper Integuments, never fail to ad|here and unite firmly to each other, as is &s;ufficiently known to the Prac|titioners in Surgery. How much &s;ooner then would this Adhae&s;ion be
<PB N="21" REF="27">produced in growing Animals, where the Fibres are not only more &s;upple, and thence more ea&s;ily united, but if deprived of the&s;e Membranes, would daily as they increa&s;e in Bulk, pre&s;s more &s;trongly again&s;t each other?</P>
<P>The Writers in Geometry have laid it down as an e&s;tabli&s;hed Maxim, that <HI>ubicunque deficit Modulus, in aeternum latebit Men&s;ura;</HI> on which account, tho' we may re&s;t &s;atisfied, that the Subtility of the &s;en&s;itive Parts in an Animal Body mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily &s;o far &s;urpa&s;s the Extent of hu|man Abilities, as to put their Bulk beyond a Po&s;&s;ibility of being ever de|termined to a Mathematical Exact|ne&s;s; yet even the Nerves them&s;elves, tho&s;e delicate In&s;truments of all our
<PB N="22" REF="28">Knowledge, may be brought under &s;uch an Examination, as to afford us a much clearer Idea of their exqui|&s;ite Minutene&s;s, than what can be obtained from tho&s;e conjectural De|&s;criptions, the Anatomi&s;ts have hi|therto given us concerning it.</P>
<P>For it is evident, that all the Mem|branes of an Animal Body have Mu&s;|cular Fibres, and that even the great|e&s;t Number of them are principally made up of &s;uch; con&s;equently we could not err very far from the Truth, were we to e&s;timate the Bulk of the Membranous Fibres in the &s;ame Pro|portion with the Mu&s;cular ones. But we &s;hall examine the Bulk and Pro|portion they bear to each other a lit|tle more di&s;tinctly.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="29">
<P>Now <HI>Leeuwenhoek</HI> in his Ob&s;erva|tions on the Mu&s;cular Fibres has &s;hewn, that &s;ome of them were equal to the 1/9th, others to the 1/16th part of a Hair
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leeuwenhoek,</HI> Epi&s;t. 6. Tom. IV.</NOTE>; con&s;equently &s;uppo&s;ing each Fibre to be the Length of a Decimal Inch, there will be contained in &s;uch a Cubic Inch &s;even Millions two hundred ninety thou&s;and of the for|mer, and twenty-three Millions forty thou&s;and of the latter Kind. But the&s;e Mu&s;cular Fibres are by later Ob&s;ervations found to be really &s;mall Mu&s;cles, con&s;i&s;ting of Parts &s;imilar to the large one, which they con&s;ti|tute, and terminating in Tendons after the &s;ame Manner as the former; and con&s;equently the Fibres, of which
<PB N="24" REF="30">the more lax and cavernous Parts of the Mu&s;cle are compo&s;ed, mu&s;t be much &s;maller than the mu&s;cular Fi|bres rendered vi&s;ible by his Gla&s;&s;es. Whether the&s;e be the &s;ame individual Fibres, which con&s;titute the Tendon, by being more clo&s;ely compacted in their Parts, I &s;hall not undertake to determine; but this we learn from the forecited Author, that a hundred of the&s;e exceed not the Bulk of a Hair
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leeuwenhoek</HI> Epi&s;t. 14. Tom. IV.</NOTE>, and con&s;equently nine hun|dred Millions of them will be con|tained in the forementioned Cubic Inch.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are far from being the &s;malle&s;t Fibres in the Body. For that the pellucid Membranes con&s;i&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="31">of Fibres of &s;till &s;maller Dimen&s;ions, decrea&s;ing probably to the 1&divisor;300^t^h part of a Hair, or upwards, is evident from the Structure of tho&s;e fine Capillary Arteries, which are de&s;tined to con|vey a Fluid to them. For the whole Diameter of &s;uch an extream Artery does not exceed the 1&divisor;1620^t^h part of an Inch
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hale's Haemae&s;t.</HI> Exp. 9.</NOTE> that is, the 1&divisor;5th of a Hair nearly, and yet the Coat of this Ve&s;|&s;el is made up of at lea&s;t three di&s;tinct Species of Membranes, each of them furni&s;hed with Ve&s;&s;els peculiar to it|&s;elf. And farther, if we con&s;ider, that the tran&s;ver&s;e Section of every Ve&s;&s;el is of a circular Form, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily allow, that the Longitudi|nal Fibres mu&s;t be much &s;maller than any of tho&s;e abovementioned; other|wi&s;e

<P>Now even the&s;e are bulky Sub|&s;tances, when compared with the nervous Fibrils de&s;tined to Sen&s;ation, as appears from tho&s;e which form the Retina. For the&s;e Fibres were manife&s;tly before their Expan&s;ion into this Membrane collected within the Bulk of what is &s;tyled by Anatomi&s;ts the Optic Nerve, and are, as the in|genious Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Monro</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, &s;o extreamly &s;mall, that it is demon|&s;trable, they cannot exceed the Thick|ne&s;s of the 1&divisor;32400th part of a Hair
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monro</HI>'s Anatomy of the Human Bones and Nerves, p. 3.</NOTE>. If therefore we reject the odd four hundred in the foregoing Fraction,
<PB N="27" REF="33">and &s;uppo&s;e, that no more than 32000 of the&s;e Nervous Fibrils are nece&s;&s;ary to make up a Thickne&s;s equal to that abovementioned, and al&s;o &s;et the Mu&s;cular, Tendinous, and Membra|nous Fibres to be at a Medium, of no greater a Thickne&s;s than the 1&divisor;200th Part of a Hair, (which, from what has been ju&s;t now explained above, is apparently a very large Allowance with re&s;pect to the Subtility of the Fibres in general) it will then follow, that the Thickne&s;s of one of the&s;e Fibrils in the Retina will be to that of &s;uch Fibres, as con&s;titute the other Membranes and Organs of the Body, in the proportion of 1 to 160. But we have already &s;hewn, that all the Sta|mina in an Animalcule could not con|tain &s;o much &s;olid Matter, as is equal

<PB N="29" REF="35">
<P>That the &s;tupendous Expan&s;ion and Action of the Fibres and Ve&s;&s;els of an Animalcule up to that of a full grown Man &s;hould be owing to an Entity like this, a mere fluxionary Increment with re&s;pect to Quantity and Magnitude, will, I doubt not, to many appear impo&s;&s;ible, to all incom|prehen&s;ible; but are not all other of the Creator's Works equally &s;o? Or is this more than infinite Power act|ing on Matter infinitely divi&s;ible is capable of, who&s;e Particles mu&s;t be &s;till higher &s;ubtili&s;ed, and &s;pun into Fibres inconceivably more minute in the Bodies of In&s;ects, than is here &s;pe|cified of the human, as they are all furni&s;hed with Arteries, Veins, Nerves, Mu&s;cles, Bones, and Tendons &s;uitable
<PB N="30" REF="36">to their various Structures, and Man|ner of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>The incomparable Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> &s;peaking of the Identity of the &s;ame Per&s;on, re&s;olves it wholly into its Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, even though the whole Sub&s;tance, material or immaterial, &s;hould be intirely changed. Many Phy&s;icians have al&s;o been of opinion, and &s;ome even laid it down as a Maxim, that the whole Sub&s;tance of the BOdy, during the Length of an ordinary Life, is &s;everal times &s;o in|tirely changed, as to con&s;i&s;t wholly of new Particles, of the &s;ame Nature and Kind as the preceeding. How far the&s;e Opinions may agree with what is taught by Divine Revelation, where this very Samene&s;s, in its
<PB N="31" REF="37">&s;tricte&s;t Acceptation, &s;eems to be ex|pre&s;sly declared, is not my province to determine. But this we may plainly deduce from what has been premi&s;ed, that the whole Sub&s;tance of the Body, except the&s;e original Stamina of the Animalcule, may be many times changed, and yet the real Body continue the &s;ame, and be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame per&s;onal Identity, with regard both to Body and Mind, at the End of the longe&s;t Life, as it was at the in&s;tant of its Birth; nay even in the Animalcule it&s;elf.</P>
<P>That the&s;e original Stamina &s;hould all remain unhurt, and fit to perform their &s;everal Functions to the End of Life, is a Po&s;ition not to be admitted; but that without a competent Num|ber
<PB N="32" REF="38">of them &s;o remaining, the Animal will decline both in its vital and in|tellectual Faculties, notwith&s;tanding the Body be repleni&s;hed with a &s;uf|ficient Number of homogeneous Par|ticles to &s;upply the Place of &s;uch Parts as are abraded and worn away, or otherwi&s;e hindered from performing their natural Functions, &s;eems equally certain; both from the Decay of our intellectual Faculties, and the gradual Lo&s;s of Vigour in the Body, even whil&s;t the Force of the vital Organs &s;eems no ways impaired. Con&s;e|quently &s;omething more mu&s;t be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, than the mere Application of homogeneous Matter to &s;upply this Demand. But that can be no other, than that particular Texture, with which they were originally formed,
<PB N="33" REF="39">and by which they become capable of tran&s;mitting the Effects of exter|nal Agents to the Mind.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that all Matter being equally incapable of Sen&s;ation, no Rea&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;&s;igned, why &s;uch homogeneous Matter, as &s;upplies the con&s;tant Lo&s;s, the Body &s;u&s;tains by the Attrition of its Parts on each other, and &s;erves for its Accretion, Strength, and Nutri|tion, may not be equally capable of conveying our Sen&s;ations to the Mind, as the original Stamina above men|tioned. But if we may rea&s;on from what en&s;ues in the larger Parts, which are compounded of the&s;e very Sta|mina, upon their being wounded, or broken with Lo&s;s of Sub&s;tance, 'tis
<PB N="34" REF="40">evident, that though by the Addi|tion of homogeneous Matter to the different Species of Ve&s;&s;els, the Body to Appearance, may have received no great Detriment, and be &s;ufficient for the principal Purpo&s;es of Life; yet are &s;uch Parts of very dull and ob|&s;cure Sen&s;ation, if they may be &s;aid to enjoy it in any other manner, than by their Union with the original Sta|mina. So that could we &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Stamina quite de&s;troyed, and the Body &s;o far changed, as to con&s;i&s;t only of &s;uch homogeneous Matter, though with Ve&s;&s;els in Form and Bulk &s;imi|lar to the former, yet the&s;e united by a Texture different from that of the original Fibres; 'tis evident from what en&s;ues upon a like Change in the Fibres con&s;tituting the larger
<PB N="35" REF="41">Parts, that &s;uch a Per&s;on, if he had either Sen&s;itive or Intellectual Facul|ties at all, mu&s;t have them in a man|ner va&s;tly different from tho&s;e of the former. And con&s;equently this Same|ne&s;s or Identity mu&s;t remain in a great Mea&s;ure fixed and unalterable in the Body from its Birth to its Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Nor is this Difference in the ori|ginal Stamina confined in its Effects to the fibrous Parts of the Body only, but communicates them to the circu|lating Juices them&s;elves, di&s;tingui&s;h|ing thereby the different Kinds of Fle&s;h of each Species of Animals from each other, even where they are &s;u|&s;tained by the &s;ame Kind of Food. Otherwi&s;e it would happen in Ca&s;es of this Kind, that the Ta&s;te, Com|plexion,
<PB N="36" REF="42">Odour, and Cohe&s;ion of the Fle&s;h would of Nece&s;&s;ity be nearly the &s;ame in all.</P>
<P>The &s;ame would be the Con&s;e|quence with regard to the Glands of the &s;ame Body, which would &s;epa|rate nearly the &s;ame Kind of Juice, and con&s;equently be u&s;ele&s;s, or per|haps prejudicial, was it not prevented by the different Structure both of the Strainer it&s;elf, and the Preparatory Ve&s;&s;els. For how&s;oever we may imagine the Juice to be &s;eparated from the circulating Ma&s;s, we cannot with any Colour of Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a various and exqui&s;ite Contri|vance, as is di&s;covered not only in the Formation of the Gland it&s;elf, but al&s;o in that of the Ve&s;&s;els leading to
<PB N="37" REF="43">and from it, &s;o widely differing among them&s;elves in their Structure, Texture, and Capacity
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Sect. 6. Exp. 47. of the Experimental Inquiry on, &amp;c.</NOTE>, &s;hould ever be de&s;igned only to perform what any one Species of them was capable of.</P>
<P>Hence then it mu&s;t follow, that the principal Differences in Animal Bodies are owing to the different Structure of the original Stamina, with regard not only to their exterior Shape and Actions, but that even the Fluids them&s;elves, and that &s;olid Part called the Fle&s;h, derive their chief and principal Difference from this Source; and con&s;equently, that there is a real Identity of Animal
<PB N="38" REF="44">Bodies incommunicable to any other, depending on this very Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor is this relating to the Fluids a mere Conjecture, but a real Fact, as appears from tho&s;e morbid Ca&s;es, where either the Glands, Preparatory Ve&s;&s;els, or even the fle&s;hy Parts are vitiated and depraved; which never fail to &s;eparate unnatural Juices, tho' derived from the mo&s;t healthful Blood.</P>
<P>Analogous to this we &s;ee in the Vegetable World, that it is not the Root, or even Trunk of the Tree, tho' all the Juices are thereby &s;up|plied, but the Bud or Scion only, which governs the whole, and pro|duces the Species of Blo&s;&s;oms and
<PB N="39" REF="45">Fruit peculiar to it&s;elf. In like manner the Ve&s;&s;els of the Animalcule, of what Species &s;oever it be, convert the Juices de&s;igned for its Nouri&s;h|ment, each, into &s;uch as are &s;uitable to their different Structures; and thence keep up an infinite Variety in Animals, tho' &s;upplied by the &s;ame kind of Food, according to the dif|ferent Ve&s;&s;els by who&s;e means it is elaborated and perfected, being in &s;ome highly volatili&s;ed and attenuat|ed, which gives the high Ta&s;te; in others more vi&s;cous and inactive, which produces the oppo&s;ite, and are therefore le&s;s plea&s;ing to a volup|tuous Appetite.</P>
<P>I am not here &s;uppo&s;ing, that the Qualities of the circulating Juices of
<PB N="40" REF="46">Animals depend &s;o intirely upon the Structure of the Solids, that the Di|ver&s;ity of Food is herein of no Con|&s;equence, daily Experience &s;ufficiently confuting &s;o ab&s;urd an Opinion. But only that in tho&s;e of a different Spe|cies, the Ta&s;te, Odour, and other Qualities of their Juices, are princi|pally owing to this different Struc|ture; as is manife&s;t from hence, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Qualities of the Juices of differing Animals, though &s;u&s;tained with the &s;ame Kind of Food, are more di&s;&s;onant to each other, than are tho&s;e of the &s;ame Species, though &s;u&s;tained with Food of a very differ|ent Nature; and con&s;equently, this Identity in the various Species of Animals, mu&s;t principally con&s;i&s;t in the Structure of the Solids, or, in
<PB N="41" REF="47">other Words, in the original Stamina of each individual Species.</P>
<P>Thus has our Rea&s;oning at length led us to the Di&s;covery and Demon|&s;tration of a Truth, which at fir&s;t Sight mu&s;t appear beyond all Proba|bility, and we can now with Cer|tainty affirm, that from &s;o &s;imple a Cau&s;e as the different Modification of the &s;ame Matter, the wi&s;e Author of Nature has produced not only one kind of Fle&s;h of Men, another of Bea&s;ts, another of Fi&s;hes, and another of Birds; but the&s;e al&s;o infinitely dif|ferent in the different Species of each.</P>
<P>Hence we may &s;ee, why &s;ome Ani|mals &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily require &s;uch a
<PB N="42" REF="48">Degree of Warmth, to pre&s;erve their Juices &s;ufficiently exalted and attenu|ated for their comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence, as others cannot &s;u&s;tain without Pre|judice, even &s;carcely without a Di&s;|&s;olution; and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> why &s;uch a Degree of Cold, as is only agree|able, or perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to the Health of the&s;e, &s;hould prove &s;o far de&s;tructive of others, as on the lea&s;t Conden&s;ation of the Fluids from that Cau&s;e, to render them torpid, mo|tionle&s;s, and &s;eemingly dead, till re|&s;tored by the kindly Influence of the approaching Summer.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o it is obvious, why the Blood and Juices of &s;ome particular Species of Animals &s;hall be affected with Di&s;ea&s;es of a Pe&s;tilential Nature
<PB N="43" REF="49">with regard to them, from &s;uch Cau&s;es, as &s;hall produce very few In|conveniences to many other Kinds.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o we may &s;ee the Rea&s;on, why each individual Per&s;on has &s;ome Particularities in his Con&s;titution pe|culiar to him&s;elf, not to be found in the Generality of the Species, nor de|pending on his Manner of Life, by which he is as it were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t: Which al&s;o probably may &s;ometimes be the Ca&s;e in Brutes, tho' more rarely than in Men, could we equally arrive at the Knowledge of it, as is manife&s;t from the different Sprightline&s;s, Vigour, and Activity of &s;ome compared with others of the &s;ame Species.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="50">
<P>La&s;tly, hence we may &s;ee, why an intire Change of the Con&s;titution &s;hould be attended with almo&s;t in&s;u|perable Difficulties: Why great Al|terations require a long and gradual Proce&s;s, nor are to be attempted by ha&s;ty Methods, le&s;t the Patient, in|&s;tead of Relief, meet with certain Ruin and De&s;truction.</P>
