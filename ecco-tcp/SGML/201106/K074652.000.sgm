<HEAD>A SINGULAR CASE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY circum&s;tance which tends to elucidate any doubtful point in the animal oeconomy, as it adds to the &s;tore of our knowledge, mu&s;t of cour&s;e contribute to &s;ettle the practice of phy&s;ic and &s;urgery upon more certain and rational principles.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>Whether a foetus can receive the infection of the &s;mall-pox, or any other contagious di&s;temper, from its mother in the womb, is a que&s;|tion which appears not to have been &s;atisfactorily &s;olved. Many eminent phy&s;iologi&s;ts have been divided in their opinions upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e publi&s;hed by Mr. John Hunter, in 1777, the point is far from being a&s;certained, to the full conviction of that celebrated teach|er's own mind; &s;ince, after having related the ca&s;e, he collects the be&s;t authorities on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and leaves the deci&s;ion to the reader's own judgment.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>It is to &s;ettle this matter beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of future controver&s;y, that the following facts are, with all re&s;pect and deference, &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of this learned Society.</P>
<P>In November, 1785, the wife of Mr. Eve, a coachmaker in Oxford-&s;treet, being then in the eighth month of her pregnancy, was &s;eized with rigors, pain in the back, and other febrile &s;ymptoms. In two days time, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hewed it&s;elf to be the &s;mall-pox; and though the pu&s;tules were of the di&s;tinct &s;ort, yet they were uncommonly nume|rous.
<PB N="6" REF="5">On the eleventh day they began to turn; and on the twenty-&s;econd day her labour took place, which, according to her reckoning, was a fortnight before the regular period; that is, when &s;he was ad|vanced in her pregnancy eight months and two weeks.</P>
<P>The child, at the time of its birth, was covered with di&s;tinct pu&s;|tules all over its body: they did not appear to be full of matter till three days after; at which time I took &s;ome of the pus upon a lancet, from one of the pu&s;tules on the face. With this lancet I afterwards ino|culated,
<PB N="7" REF="6">on the 2d of December, 1785, a child of Mr. Chaters, in Church-&s;treet, Soho, in both arms. On the 7th the inflammation began to appear in each arm, and conti|nued daily increa&s;ing till the 11th of December, when the child &s;ick|ened, and was affected with all the &s;ymptoms which u&s;ually precede the eruption. On the 12th the &s;ick|ne&s;s and fever abated, the pu&s;tules of the di&s;tinct &s;ort of &s;mall-pox made their appearance, and the child having regularly gone through the &s;everal &s;tages of the di&s;temper, was perfectly well in three weeks.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>It may be proper to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Findlay, &s;urgeon, in Sackville Street, and Mr. Holladay, late &s;ur|geon to Sir Edward Hughes, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, were pre&s;ent, both at the taking of the matter, and at the &s;ub&s;equent inoculation of the child.</P>
<P>As no circum&s;tance can prove the identity of the &s;mall-pox more in|di&s;putably, than its being commu|nicated, with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms and progre&s;&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e, from one &s;ubject to another; &s;o it appears to be a&s;certained from the above facts, that a child can receive the variolous infection from its mother, <HI>in utero.</HI></P>

<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' the fact of the po&s;|&s;ibility of the &s;mall-pox being communicated from the mother to the foetus, <HI>in utero,</HI> be clearly proved in this ca&s;e, yet there may &s;till re|main &s;ome doubt with re&s;pect to the mode of communication.</P>
<P>It may be urged, that if we &s;up|po&s;e the communication of the di&s;|ea&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="9">from the mother to the child to be effected by means of the circulat|ing fluids, then the child would never e&s;cape the infection, when the mother had the di&s;ea&s;e; where|as the contrary appears in the in|&s;tance adduced by Mr. John Hunter from Boerhave, of a lady who hav|ing gone through the confluent &s;mall-pox in the &s;ixth month of her pregnancy, brought forth after|wards, at the regular period, a child, who&s;e body did not &s;hew the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered: It is by no means nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="11" REF="10">the contagion to be conveyed by the circulating fluids, that there &s;hould be no po&s;&s;ibility of the child's e&s;cap|ing the di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e this a&s;&s;er|tion proves too much. For it ap|pears, that there mu&s;t always be a certain aptitude or fitne&s;s in a body to receive any infection offered to it; and that unle&s;s this fitne&s;s or aptitude prevails, the infection will not take place. What this fitne&s;s or aptitude is, we cannot tell; but that it really doth exi&s;t, is evident from daily and palpable experience; otherwi&s;e, every per&s;on expo&s;ed to any contagious di&s;ea&s;e would never e&s;cape. How many are there re|&s;pecting
<PB N="12" REF="11">the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, who never having had it them|&s;elves, are ca&s;ually or purpo&s;ely ex|po&s;ed to infection, and e&s;cape it &s;everal times, while they &s;hall catch it upon another occa&s;ion, when perhaps they lea&s;t expected it? Nor is there any rea&s;on which can in|duce us to &s;uppo&s;e, that this ap|titude or fitne&s;s for receiving infec|tion is not as nece&s;&s;ary to produce the di&s;ea&s;e, when the virus is im|mediately conveyed by the circu|lating fluids, as when it is previ|ou&s;ly to be ab&s;orbed: For in the in&s;tances alledged, although the virus had not acted upon the con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="13" REF="12">&s;o as to produce the di&s;ea&s;e, yet we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the whole ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem to be entirely in|active, &s;o as that no particle of matter, capable of infecting, &s;hall be taken up by the body, repeat|edly expo&s;ed to it. The action and power of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t go on; and therefore, when a con|tagious di&s;temper is not produced in any body expo&s;ed to it, this can only be accounted for, from the inaptitude or unfitne&s;s of the con|&s;titution to produce it at the time, however my&s;terious that inaptitude or unfitne&s;s may be.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P>In the ca&s;e mentioned by Boer|have, if the foregoing rea&s;oning has been well founded, we might &s;uppo&s;e that there was a want of aptitude in the foetus to receive the infection, although it was circulat|ing in the fluids of the mother; or there is another way of con&s;idering it, which is, that the child had really gone through the &s;mall-pox <HI>in utero,</HI> but had been born without any marks. How many are there who go through the di&s;ea&s;e, and never bear the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of it after|wards?</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, there was full time enough for the child to catch the
<PB N="15" REF="14">infection, go through the &s;everal &s;tages of it, and come into the world without a &s;pot; for the lady having had the di&s;ea&s;e in the &s;ixth month, implies, that &s;he had gone through it before the &s;ix months were com|pleted; con&s;equently there were full three months remaining before the child came into the world.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, therefore, the child to have gone through the di&s;ea&s;e before the &s;eventh month was ac|compli&s;hed, it had &s;till upwards of two months to get rid of any marks remaining from any previous pu&s;tu|les it might have had; and is it not
<PB N="16" REF="15">extremely probable, that the cir|cum&s;tance of the child's being en|tirely &s;ecluded from the external air, at that period, may have con|tributed much to aboli&s;h or &s;horten the duration of the&s;e marks? Again; every one knows from daily expe|rience, that becau&s;e the mother had a confluent &s;mall-pox, there was no nece&s;&s;ity that the child &s;hould have one of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>If it be po&s;&s;ible, then, that the child &s;hould have had a mild &s;mall-pox, it is on the other hand impo&s;|&s;ible to a&s;certain the number of pu&s;|tules it might have had. One or two
<PB N="17" REF="16">are &s;ufficient to characteri&s;e the di&s;temper, and many per&s;ons go through it, both in the natural way and by inoculation, with no other external mark. Some eminent phy|&s;icians indeed, among whom is Boer|have, have been of opinion, that the eruption is not <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the di&s;ea&s;e; and that a per&s;on may go through the vario|lous fever without any apparent eruption, and be as free from future infection as if the eruption had ap|peared.</P>
<P>There is nothing, therefore, which militates again&s;t the &s;uppo|&s;ition of the contagion being con|veyed
<PB N="18" REF="17">from the mother to the <HI>foetus in utero,</HI> by means of the circulating fluids; even in tho&s;e in&s;tances ad|duced of the child having caught the di&s;temper in the womb of its mother, who had previou&s;ly expe|rienced it, and therefore was not her&s;elf &s;u&s;ceptible of it. Can we &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e to be conveyed to the child any way, then, through the mother? A &s;ubject may ab&s;orb, and convey an infection to another, of which it is not it&s;elf &s;u&s;ceptible; and in this ca&s;e, the mother be|comes the vehicle of a poi&s;on, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any ef|fect upon her&s;elf.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>But, if the &s;mall-pox was con+veyed to the child in this ca&s;e, thro' the medium of the circulating flu|ids, which indeed appears to be the only way by which it could be con|veyed, it follows, that other conta|gious di&s;ea&s;es may be communi|cated from the mother to the <HI>foetus in utero,</HI> through the &s;ame channel; and therefore, the po&s;&s;ibility of the like event extends to the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
