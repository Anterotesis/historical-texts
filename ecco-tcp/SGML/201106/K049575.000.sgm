<P>THAT &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es are properly the Effects of the Influence of the heavenly Bodies, and that others do vary their Periods and Symptoms according to the different Po&s;itions of one or other of tho&s;e luminous Globes, is a very antient and certain Ob&s;ervation. Upon this Score <HI>Hippocrates</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. ad The&s;&s;alum Filium.</NOTE> advi&s;es his Son <HI>The&s;&s;alus</HI> to the Study of Geometry and Numbers, becau&s;e <HI>the Knowledge of the Stars is of very great U&s;e in Phy&s;ick</HI>
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. De Aere Aquis &amp; Locis.</NOTE>. And the earlie&s;t Hi&s;tories of Epidemick Di&s;tem|pers, particularly do all turn upon the Alterations made in our Bodies by the Heavens.</P>
<P>But when in later Times Medicine came to be accommodated to the Rea&s;onings of Philo&s;ophers;
<PB N="4" REF="3">no body being able to account for the Manner of this cele&s;tial Action, it was allowed no far|ther Share in affecting our Health, than what might be imputed to the Changes in the manife&s;t Con&s;titution of the Air, excepting perhaps &s;ome|thing of Truth which &s;till remains di&s;gui&s;ed and blended with the Jargon of judiciary A&s;trology.</P>
<P>In order therefore to &s;et this Matter in a little clearer Light, I &s;hall in the fir&s;t Place &s;hew, That the Sun and Moon regarding their Near|ne&s;s and Direction to the Earth only, be&s;ides the Effects of Heat, Moi&s;ture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thereby cau&s;ed in our Atmo&s;phere, mu&s;t at certain Times make &s;ome Alterations in all Animal Bodies; then enumerate &s;ome Hi&s;tories and Ob&s;ervations of &s;uch Changes, and enquire of what U&s;e &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e may be in the Practice of Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;tant Ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e who write the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Winds,</HI> That the mo&s;t windy Sea&s;ons of the Year, are the Time about the Vernal and Autumnal Equinox; for be the Air never &s;o calm before or after, we never fail of having Winds at that Juncture. Every body likewi&s;e knows, that in the mo&s;t quiet Weather we are &s;ure of &s;ome Breeze at Mid-day and Mid|night, as al&s;o at full Sea, <HI>i. e.</HI> always about the Time the Sun or Moon arrive at the Meridian. Seamen and Country People reckon upon this, and order their Affairs accordingly. And the Changes of the Weather as to Winds or Calms e&s;pecially about the new and full Moon, are too well known to require any Authority to confirm &s;uch Remarks. Tho&s;e who de&s;ire a fuller Ac|count of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, may &s;ee it in <HI>De Chales</HI>'s Navigation, <HI>Ga&s;&s;endus</HI>'s Natural Philo&s;o|phy, and <HI>J. Goad,</HI> his <HI>A&s;tro-Meteoro-Logica.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>The&s;e Things being Matters of Fact, and in a Manner regular and univer&s;al, it may very well &s;eem &s;trange that Philo&s;ophers have not been more accurate in their Enquiries into the Rea&s;on of &s;uch Appearances. True indeed it is, that the Origin of Winds is various and uncertain, but however, &s;o con&s;tant and uniform an Effect mu&s;t undoubtedly be owing to one nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been, now a con&s;iderable Time &s;ince, &s;ufficiently made out, that our Atmo&s;phere is a thin ela&s;tic Fluid, one Part of which gravitates upon another, and who&s;e Pre&s;&s;ure is communi|cated every Way in a Sphere to any given Part thereof. From hence it follows, That if by any external Cau&s;e the Gravity of any one Part &s;hou'd be taken off or dimini&s;hed, that from all &s;ides a|round this Part, the more heavy Air would ru&s;h in to re&s;tore the Equilibrium which mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity be pre&s;erved in all Fluids. Now this vio|lent running in of the heavier Air would certain|ly produce a Wind, which is no more than a &s;trong Motion of the Air in &s;ome determined Di|rection. If therefore we can find any outward Cau&s;e that would at the&s;e &s;tated Sea&s;ons we have mentioned, dimini&s;h the Weight or Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere; we &s;hall have the genuine Rea&s;on of the&s;e periodical Winds, and the nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;equences thereof.</P>
<P>The Flux and Reflux of the Sea was a Phoe|nomenon too vi&s;ible, and too much conducing to the Sub&s;i&s;tance of Mankind, and all other Animals, to be neglected by tho&s;e who applied them&s;elves to the Study of Nature; however all their Attempts to explain this admirable Con|trivance of infinite Wi&s;dom were un&s;ucce&s;sful, till Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> reveal'd to the World ju&s;ter Principles, and by a truer Philo&s;ophy than was
<PB N="6" REF="5">formerly known, &s;hew'd us how by the united or divided Forces of the Sun and Moon, which are encrea&s;ed and le&s;&s;ened by &s;everal Circum&s;tances, all the Varieties of the Tides are to be accounted for. And &s;ince all the Changes we have enume|rated in the Atmo&s;phere do fall out at the &s;ame Times when tho&s;e happen in the Ocean; and likewi&s;e whereas both the Waters of the Sea and the Air of our Earth, are Fluids &s;ubject, in a great Mea&s;ure, to the &s;ame Laws of Motion; it is plain, that the Rule of our great Philo&s;opher takes place here, <HI>viz. That natural Effects of the &s;ame kind are owing to the &s;ame Cau&s;es</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Newton. <HI>Princip. p.</HI> 402.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>What Difference that known Property of the Air, which is not in Water, makes in the Ca&s;e, I &s;hall &s;hew anon; &s;etting a&s;ide the Con&s;idera|tion of that for the pre&s;ent; It is certain, That as the Sea is, &s;o mu&s;t our Air, twice every 25 Hours, be rai&s;ed upwards to a con&s;iderable Height, by the Attraction of the Moon coming to the Meridian; &s;o that in&s;tead of a <HI>Spherical,</HI> it mu&s;t form it&s;elf into a <HI>Spheroidal,</HI> or <HI>Oval</HI> Figure, who&s;e longe&s;t Diameter being produced, would pa&s;s thro' the Moon. That the like rai&s;ing mu&s;t form it&s;elf into a <HI>Spheroidal,</HI> or <HI>Oval</HI> Figure, who&s;e longe&s;t Diameter being produced, would pa&s;s thro' the Moon. That the like rai&s;ing mu&s;t follow as often as the Sun is in the Meridian of any Place, either above or below the Horizon. Moreover, That this Elevation is <HI>greate&s;t</HI> upon the new and full Moons, becau&s;e both Sun and Moon do then con&s;pire in their Attraction; <HI>lea&s;t</HI> on the Quarters, in that they then drawing dif|ferent Ways, 'tis only the Difference of their Actions produces the Effect. La&s;tly, That this Intume&s;cence will be of a <HI>middle Degree,</HI> at the Time between the Quarters, and new and full Moon.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>From the &s;ame Principles, the Motion up|wards of the Air will be &s;tronge&s;t of all about the Equinoxes; the Equinoctial Line being over that Circle of the Globe, which has the greate&s;t Diameter, either of the Luminaries when in that are nearer, and the Agitation of the Fluid Sphe|roid revolving about a greater Circle, is greater; be&s;ides, the centrifugal Force (ari&s;ing from the diurnal Rotation) is there greate&s;t of all. This will &s;till be more con&s;iderable about the new and full Moons happening at the&s;e Times, for the Rea&s;ons ju&s;t now mentioned. And the lea&s;t Attraction will be about the Quadratures of the&s;e Lunar Months, becau&s;e the Declination of the Moon from the Equator is then greate&s;t. The different Di&s;tances of the Moon in her Perigaeum and Apogaeum, are the Rea&s;on that the&s;e full Changes fall out a little before the Vernal, and after the Autumnal Equinox. Now the Inver&s;e of all this happens when the Luminaries are in the Sol&s;titial Circles. La&s;tly, In the &s;ame Pa|rallel, when the Moon's Declination is towards the elevated Pole, the Attraction is &s;tronge&s;t when the Moon is in that Place's Meridian, and weake&s;t when &s;he is in the oppo&s;ite Place's Meridian: The contrary happens in the oppo&s;ite Parallel; by rea&s;on of the &s;pheroidal Figure of the Earth and its Atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Whatever has been &s;aid on this Head, is no more than applying what Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has de|mon&s;trated of the Sea to our Atmo&s;phere; and it is needle&s;s to &s;hew how nece&s;&s;arily tho&s;e Appear|ances, ju&s;t now mentioned of <HI>Winds,</HI> at the &s;tated Times, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t happen hereupon. It will be of more u&s;e to con&s;ider the Proportion of the Forces of the two Luminaries upon the <HI>Air,</HI> to that which they have upon the Water of our
<PB N="8" REF="7">Globe; that it may the more plainly appear what Influence the Alterations hereby made, mu&s;t have upon the Animal Body.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has demon&s;trated,
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Princip. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Prop.</HI> 36.</NOTE> That the Force of the Sun to move the Sea, is to the Force of Gravity, as 1 to 12868200. Let that be
<GAP DESC="math"> And that the Force of the Moon to rai&s;e the Sea is to Gravity, as 1 to 2031821. Let this be
<GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>And &s;ince the centrifugal Force of the Parts of the Earth ari&s;ing from its diurnal Motion is to Gravity, as 1 to 291. Let this be <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>The &s;ame Philo&s;opher has taught us
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Prop.</HI> 37.</NOTE> that the centrifugal Force rai&s;es the Water at the Equator above the Water at the Poles, to the Height of 85200 Feet. Wherefore if that Force which is as 6031, rai&s;es the Ocean to 85200 Feet, the united Forces of the Sun and Moon, which are as 1. will rai&s;e the &s;ame to 14 Feet, for 85200&divisor;6031 &equals; 14. <HI>Proxime.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>Now we know that the more ea&s;ily the Wa|ter can obey the Attraction, with the more Force are the Tides moved; but &s;ince, as Mr. <HI>Halley</HI> has determin'd it,
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;.</HI> No. 181.</NOTE> our Atmo&s;phere is extended to 45 Miles, whereas the middle Depth of the Ocean is but about half a Mile; it is plain, that the Air revolving in a Sphere about 100 Times larger than that of the Ocean, will have a pro|portionably greater Agitation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; Rocks, Shelves, and the Inequality of Shoars are a great Stop to the Acce&s;s and Rece&s;s of the Sea: But nothing repels the ri&s;ing Air, whic his al&s;o of &s;uch Thinne&s;s and Fluidity, that it is ea&s;ily driven, and runs every Way.</P>
<P>Nor ought we to omit, that it is the univer|&s;al Law of Bodies attracted, that the Force of Attraction is reciprocally as the Squares of their Di&s;tances; &s;o that the Action of the Sun and Moon will be greater upon the Air than upon the Water, upon the Account of its Near|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;ideration of the Ela&s;ticity is &s;till of greater Moment here, of which this is the Nature, that it is reciprocally as the Pre&s;&s;ure, &s;o that the incumbent Weight being dimini&s;hed by the Attraction, the Air underneath will upon this Score be mightily expanded.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;uch like Cau&s;es will make the Tides in the Air to be much greater than tho&s;e of the Ocean; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to our purpo&s;e to de|termine, by nice Calculations, their particular Forces; it is &s;ufficient to have proved that the&s;e Motions mu&s;t both be univer&s;al, and al&s;o return at certain Intervals.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>Now &s;ince the rai&s;ing of the Water of the Ocean 14 Feet, produces Torrents of &s;uch a pro|digious Force, we may ea&s;ily conceive what Tempe&s;ts of Winds (if not otherwi&s;e check'd) the Elevation of the Air much higher (perhaps above a Mile) will nece&s;&s;arily cau&s;e. And there is no doubt to be made, but that the &s;ame infi|nitely wi&s;e Being who contrived the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, to &s;ecure that va&s;t Collection of Waters from Stagnation and Corruption (which would inevitably de&s;troy all the Animals and Ve|getables on this Globe) has ordered this Ebb and Flood of the Air of our Atmo&s;phere, with the like good De&s;ign, that is to pre&s;erve (in Ca&s;e all other Cau&s;es &s;hould fail, as they may, and at Times do in &s;ome Countries) the &s;weet Fre&s;hne&s;s, and bri&s;k Temper of this Fluid, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Life, and keep it, by a kind of continual Circulation, from Deadne&s;s and Stinking.</P>
<P>This Rea&s;oning is liable to only one Objection that I know of, and that is this: That the Ap|pearances we have mentioned cannot be owing to the Cau&s;es now a&s;&s;igned; &s;ince by Calcula|tion from them, the Mercury mu&s;t at new and full Moon &s;ub&s;ide in the Barometer to a certain Degree, which yet we do not ob&s;erve to happen.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to which, (be&s;ides that there have been &s;ome Ob&s;ervations made of the &s;inking of the Mercury at tho&s;e Times; and it may perhaps be the Fault of the Ob&s;ervers that the&s;e have not been reduced to any Rule) we are to con&s;ider, That altho' Winds and Alterations in the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere, are the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equents of the lunar Attraction, and true Cau&s;es of the diffe|rent Ri&s;e of the Mercury in the Barometer; yet the&s;e may be produced many other ways too, and therefore tho' regularly the Mercury would always
<PB N="11" REF="10">fall at the new and full Moon, tho&s;e other Cau&s;es may be &s;trong enough, even to rai&s;e it at tho&s;e Sea&s;ons; in as much as two contrary Winds, for In&s;tance, blowing towards the Place of Ob&s;erva|tion, may accumulate the Air there, &s;o as to in|crea&s;e both the Height and Weight of the incum|bent Cylinder; in like Manner, the Direction of two Winds may be &s;uch, as meeting at a certain Angle they may keep the Gravity of the Air in the middle Place unalter'd; and a Thou&s;and &s;uch Varieties there may be, by which the Regularity of Appearances of this Nature may be hinder'd. Now the other Springs, from which &s;uch Changes in the Air may ari&s;e, are the&s;e;</P>
<P N="1">1. Ela&s;tic Vapours forc'd from the Bowels of the Earth, by &s;ubterraneous Heats, and conden&s;ed by whatever Cau&s;e in the Atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Mixture of Effluvia of different Qualities in the Air, may by Rarefactions, Fermentations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> produce Winds and other Effects like tho&s;e re&s;ulting from the Combination of &s;ome Chymical Liquors; and that &s;uch Things happen, we are a&s;&s;ur'd from the Nature of Thunder, Lightning, and Meteors.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the Eruptions of Vulcanoes and Earth|quakes in di&s;tant Places, Winds may be propa|gated to remoter Countries.</P>
<P N="4">4. The divided or united Forces of the other Planets and of Comets, may variou&s;ly di&s;turb the Influence of the Sun and Moon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We know that there happen violent Tempe&s;ts in the upper Regions of the Air, while we below enjoy a Calm; and how many Ridges of Mountains there are on our Globe, which interrupt and check the Propa|gation of the Winds; &s;o that it is no wonder that the Phaenomena we have a&s;cribed to the Action of
<PB N="12" REF="11">the Sun and Moon, are not always con&s;tant and uniform, and that every Effect does not hereupon follow; which, were there no other Powers in Nature able to alter the Influence of this, might in a very regular and uniform Manner be expected from it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being premi&s;ed, it will not be difficult to &s;hew (as was propo&s;ed in the fir&s;t Place) that the&s;e Changes in our Atmo&s;phere at high Water, new and full Moon, the Equinoxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;ome Alterations in all Animal Bo|dies; and that from the following Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. All living Creatures require Air of a deter|min'd Gravity to perform Re&s;piration ea&s;ily, and with Advantage; for it is by its Weight that this Fluid in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the Cavity of the Brea&s;t and Lungs. Now the Gravity, as we have prov'd, being le&s;&s;en'd at the&s;e Sea&s;ons, a &s;maller Quantity only will in&s;inuate it&s;elf, and this mu&s;t be of &s;maller Force to comminute the Blood, and forward its Pa&s;&s;age into the left Ventricle of the Heart, whence a &s;lower Circulation in&s;ues, and the Secretion of the Spirits is dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Effect will be the more &s;ure, in that the Ela&s;ticity of the Atmo&s;phere is likewi&s;e dimini&s;h'd. Animals want Air as heavy &s;o ela&s;tic to a certain Degree; for as this is by its Weight forced into the Cavity of the <HI>Thorax</HI> in In&s;piration, &s;o the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> pre&s;s it into the <HI>Bronchi</HI> in Expiration, where the bending Force being &s;ome|what taken off, and &s;pringy Bodies when unbended, exerting their Power every Way, in Proportion to their Pre&s;&s;ures, the Parts of the Air pu&s;h again&s;t all the Sides of the <HI>Ve&s;iculae,</HI> and promote the Pa&s;|&s;age of the Blood.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>We have a convincing In&s;tance of all this, in tho&s;e who go to the Top of high Mountains, for the Air is there &s;o pure (as they call it) that is, wants &s;o much of its Gravity and Ela&s;ticity, that they breathe with very great Difficulty.</P>
<P N="3">3. All the Fluids in Animals have in them a Mixture of ela&s;tic <HI>Aura,</HI> which when &s;et at Liber|ty, &s;hews its Energy, and cau&s;es tho&s;e Fermenta|tions we ob&s;erve in the Blood and Spirits: Now when the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere, upon the Surface of our Body is dimini&s;h'd, the inward Air in the Ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be inabled to exert its Force, in Proportion to the le&s;&s;ening the Gra|vity and Ela&s;ticity of the outward; hereupon the Juices begin to ferment, change the Union and Cohae&s;ion of their Parts, break their Canals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This is very plain in living Creatures put into the Receiver, exhau&s;ted by the Air-Pump, which always &s;well as the Air is more and more drawn out; their Lungs at the &s;ame Time contracting them&s;elves, and falling &s;o together as to be hardly di&s;cernible
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;perienze dell' Academia del Cimento,</HI> p. m. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>E're we proceed to Matters of Fact, it may be worth the while to take Notice, that Effects depending on &s;uch Cau&s;es as the&s;e, mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity be mo&s;t vi&s;ible in weak Bodies and mor|bid Con&s;titutions, when other Circum&s;tances con|cur to their taking Place. For this Rea&s;on, what|ever Mi&s;chiefs do hence follow, cannot in the lea&s;t di&s;parage the wi&s;e Contrivance of infinite Power in ordering the&s;e Tides of our Atmo&s;phere. The Author of Nature, we know, has made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> Things to the greate&s;t Advantage that could be, for the whole Sy&s;tem of Animals on our Globe,
<PB N="14" REF="13">but it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould not in &s;ome Ca&s;es be prejudicial to a few. The Po&s;ition and Di&s;tance of the Sun are &s;o adju&s;ted, as to give in the mo&s;t beneficial Manner po&s;&s;ible, Heat and Light to the Earth; yet this notwith|&s;tanding, &s;ome Places may be too hot for &s;ome weakly Bodies; &s;ome Autumns too &s;ultry to agree with &s;ome Animals, and &s;ome Winters too cold to be endured by &s;ome tender Creatures: The whole however we mu&s;t own, is mo&s;t carefully provided for. Be&s;ides, as mo&s;t of the&s;e la&s;t men|tioned Inconveniences are by ea&s;y Shifts to be a|voided; &s;o there are &s;uch powerful Checks put to this aerial Flux and Reflux, &s;o many ways of abating the Damages accruing from it now and then; that the&s;e are of no Account in compa|ri&s;on of the mighty Benefits hence ari&s;ing, in which the Race of Mankind does univer&s;ally &s;hare.</P>

<P>But no greater Con&s;ent in &s;uch Ca&s;es was per|haps ever ob&s;erved than what I &s;aw &s;ome Time &s;ince in a Child about five Years old, in which the Convul&s;ions were &s;o &s;trong and frequent, that Life was almo&s;t de&s;pair'd of, and by Evacua|tions and other Medicines very difficulty &s;aved. The Girl, who was of a lu&s;ty full Habit of Body, continued well for a few Days, but was at Full Moon again &s;eized with a mo&s;t violent Fit, after which, the Di&s;ea&s;e kept its Periods con&s;tant and regular with the Tides; She lay al|ways Speechle&s;s during the whole Time of Flood, and recovered upon the Ebb. The Father who lives by the <HI>Thames</HI> Side, and does Bu&s;ine&s;s up|on the River, ob&s;erved the&s;e Returns to be &s;o punctual, that not only coming Home, he knew how the Child was before he &s;aw it, but in the Night has ri&s;en to his Employ, being warned by Cries when coming out of her Fit, of the turn|ing of the Water. This continued 14 Days, that is, to the next great Change of the Moon, and then a dry Scab on the Crown of the Head, (the Effect of an Epi&s;pa&s;tick Plai&s;ter, with which I had covered the whole <HI>Occiput</HI> in the Beginning of the Illne&s;s) broke, and from the Sore, tho' there had been no &s;en&s;ible

<P>The Ca&s;e being thus with Females, it is no wonder if we &s;ometimes meet with Periodical Haemorrhages an&s;wering to the Times of the Moon in Males al&s;o.

<P>It is very well worth the Pains to enquire what Share &s;uch an Alteration in the Weight and Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere may have in the <HI>Cri&s;es</HI> or Changes of acute Di&s;ea&s;es. The Antients made great Account of <HI>critical</HI> Days, and regulated their Practice according to the Expectation they had from them; This Part of Phy&s;ick is grown now into Di&s;u&s;e, quite
<PB N="23" REF="22">&s;lighted, and even ridiculed; and that I &s;up|po&s;e chiefly for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons. In the fir&s;t Place, becau&s;e the earlie&s;t Ob&s;ervations of this Kind, which were drawn into Rules, being made in <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Countries, when the&s;e came to be applied to the Di&s;tempers of the <HI>Northern</HI> Re|gions, without Allowance given for the Difference of the Climate, they were oftentimes found not to an&s;wer. And &s;econdly, Fevers of old were treated with few or no Medicines, the Motions of Nature were carefully watched, and no Violence offer'd to interrupt her Work. The Hi&s;tories therefore of <HI>Cri&s;es,</HI> though of great U&s;e, and Certainty under &s;uch Management as this, were at length unavoidably &s;et a&s;ide and lo&s;t; when acute Ca&s;es came to be cured, according to this or that Hypothe&s;is, not only by Evacuations, but hot or cold Alteratives too; there being no longer any Room for tho&s;e Laws of Practice, which &s;uppo&s;ed a regular and uniform Progre&s;s of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in order to under&s;tand a little both what might induce the fir&s;t Ma&s;ters of our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion to &s;o nice and &s;trict an Ob&s;ervance in this Point; and what Grounds there may be now, for a more due Regard to their Pre|cepts, even upon the Score of the Lunar At|traction only, I propo&s;e the following Re|marks.</P>
<P N="1">1. All Epidemick Di&s;ea&s;es, do in their regu|lar Cour&s;e require a &s;tated Time, in which they come to their Height, decline, and leave the Body free.</P>
<P>This is &s;o con&s;tant and certain, that when a Fever of any <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> which is <HI>continual</HI> in one Subject, happens from &s;ome other Cau&s;e,
<PB N="24" REF="23">in another to be <HI>intermitting,</HI> the Paroxi&s;ms do always return &s;o often as all together to make up ju&s;t as many Days of Illne&s;s as he &s;uffers, who&s;e Di&s;temper goes on from Beginning to End, with|out any Abatement.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> a &s;worn Enemy to all Theories, learn'd thus much from downright Ob&s;erva|tion; and gives this Rea&s;on why autumnal Quartans holds &s;ix Months, becau&s;e by Compu|tation the Fits of &s;o long a Time amount to 336 Hours, or 14 Days, the Period of a continual Fever of the &s;ame Sea&s;on.
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Febr. Intermit.</HI> Ann. 1661. pag. <HI>m.</HI> 65.</NOTE></P>
<P>So <HI>Galen</HI> takes Notice, that when an exqui&s;ite Tertain is terminated in &s;even Paroxi&s;ms, a true Continual, at the &s;ame Time, has its Cri&s;is in &s;even Days; that is, the Fever la&s;ts as long in one as in the other, in as much (&s;ays he) as <HI>a Fit in an Intermitting Fever, an&s;wers to a Day in a Continual.</HI>
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Comment. in Aphor.</HI> 59. lib. 4. <HI>&amp; de Cri&s;ib.</HI> lib. 2. c. 6.</NOTE> Now this &s;o comes to pa&s;s, becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="2">2. In the&s;e Ca&s;es there is always a Fermenta|tion in the Blood, which goes not off till the active Particles are thrown out by tho&s;e Organs of Secretion, which, according to the Laws of Motion, are mo&s;t fitted to &s;eparate 'em. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. As different Liquors put upon a Ferment, are depurated in different Times, &s;o the Arte|rial Fluid takes up a determined Period, of which it is di&s;charged of an induced Effer|ve&s;cence.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Symptoms, during this Ebullition, do not proceed all along in the &s;ame Tenour; but on &s;ome Days particularly, they give &s;uch
<PB N="25" REF="24">evident Marks of their good or bad Qua|lity, that the Nature of the en&s;uing <HI>Solution</HI> may very well be gue&s;s'd at, and foretold by 'em.</P>
<P>Things being thus, Tho&s;e Days on which the Di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o evidently terminated one Way or other, might very ju&s;tly be call'd the Days of <HI>Cri&s;is;</HI> and tho&s;e upon which the Ten|dency of Illne&s;s was di&s;covered by mo&s;t vi&s;i|ble Tokens, the <HI>Indices</HI> of the <HI>critical Days.</HI></P>
<P>And thus far the Foundation was good: but when a fal&s;e Theory happen'd unluckily to be joined to true Ob&s;ervations, this did a little puzzle the Cau&s;e. <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> it is plain, knew not to what to a&s;cribe that re|markable Regularity with which he &s;aw the Periods of Fevers were ended on the <HI>Seventh, Fourteenth, One and Twentieth</HI> Day, <HI>&amp;c. Py|thagoras</HI> his Philo&s;ophy was in tho&s;e Ages very Famous, of which <HI>Harmony</HI> and the <HI>My&s;teries of Numbers</HI> made a con&s;iderable Part, <HI>Odd</HI> were more powerful than <HI>Even,</HI> and <HI>Seven</HI> was the mo&s;t perfect of all. Our great Phy&s;ician e&s;pou&s;ed the&s;e Notions,
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epidem.</HI> lib. 1. Sect. 3.</NOTE> and confined the Stages of acute Di&s;tempers to a <HI>Septenary</HI> Pro|gre&s;&s;ion

<PB N="26" REF="25">mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily oftentimes happen, will appear by and by.</P>
<P>Upon this Score <HI>A&s;clepiades</HI> rejected this whole Doctrine as vain,
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. Cel&s;um.</HI> lib. 3. c. 4.</NOTE> and <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> finding it to be too nice and &s;crupulous, ob&s;erves that the <HI>Pythagorean Numbers led the Ancients into the Error.</HI>
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Galen</HI> being aware of this, &s;ucceeded much better in his rea&s;oning upon the Matter, and very happily imputed the critical Changes not to the Power of Numbers, but to the Influ|ence of the Moon; which he ob&s;erves, <HI>has a mighty Action upon our Earth, exceeding the other Planets, not in Energy, but in Nearne&s;s</HI>
<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Diebus Decretor</HI> lib. 3.</NOTE> So that according to him, the Septenary Periods in Di&s;ea&s;es are owing to the <HI>Quarterly Lunar Pha&s;es, which are the Times of the greate&s;t Force, and which return in about &s;even Days.</HI>
<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Re&s;ult of the whole Affair, in &s;hort is this: A <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> is no more than the Expul&s;ion of the morbific Matter out of the Body, thro' &s;ome or other of the Secretory Organs; in or|der to which, it is nece&s;&s;ary that this &s;hould be prepar'd and comminuted to &s;uch a Degree, as is required to make it pa&s;s into the Ori|fices of the re&s;pective Glands; and therefore <HI>as</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>perfect Cri&s;is</HI> is by <HI>Sweat,</HI> (both by Rea&s;on that the Subcutaneous Glands do naturally di&s;charge more than all the other put together, and al&s;o that their Ducts being the
<PB N="27" REF="26">&s;malle&s;t of any, what&s;oever comes this Way is certainly very well divided and broken) <HI>&s;o</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>imperfect</HI> is an <HI>Haemorrhage;</HI> becau&s;e This is an Argument that what offends is not fit to be ca&s;t off in any Part, and con&s;equently breaks the Ve&s;&s;els by the Efferve&s;cence of the Blood. An <HI>Ab&s;ce&s;s</HI> in tho&s;e Organs which &s;e|parate thick &s;limy Juices, is of a middle Na|ture betwixt the&s;e two.</P>
<P>Now it is very plain, That if the Time, in which either the Peccant Humour is prepar'd for Secretion, or the Fermentation of the Blood is come to its Height, falls in with tho&s;e Changes in the Atmo&s;phere which dimini&s;h its Pre&s;|&s;ure; the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> will then be more compleat and large. And al&s;o, that this Work may be forwarded or delay'd a Day upon the Account of &s;uch an Alteration in the Air; the Di&s;ten|tion of the Ve&s;&s;els upon which it depends, being hereby made more ea&s;y, and a weak Ha|bit of Body in &s;ome Ca&s;es &s;tanding in need of this outward A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus a Fever which requires about a Week to its Period, may &s;ome|times, as <HI>Hippocrates</HI> ob&s;erved, have a good Cri&s;is on the &s;ixth, and &s;ometimes not 'till the eighth Day.</P>
<P>In Order therefore to make true Ob&s;erva|tions of this Kind, the Time of Inva&s;ion is to be con&s;idered, The genuine Cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper mu&s;t fir&s;t be watched, which is not to be interrupted by any violent Methods: The Strength of Nature in the Patient is to be con&s;idered, and by what Secretions the Cri|&s;is is mo&s;t likely to be performed; and it will then be found, that not only the <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Full</HI> Moons, but even the <HI>Southings,</HI> whe|ther
<PB N="28" REF="27">vi&s;ible or latent, of the Planet, are here of con&s;iderable Moment.</P>
<P>For Confirmation of which, we need only to reflect on what Mr. <HI>Pa&s;chal</HI> has remark'd, <HI>concerning the Motions of Di&s;ea&s;es and Births and Deaths</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;act.</HI> No. 202.</NOTE>.

<P>This Influence was, without all doubt, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by &s;ome &s;uch other Cau&s;es of <HI>Winds,</HI> as
<PB N="30" REF="29">we have mentioned; the&s;e we can't know, but may however take Notice how much the ma|nife&s;t State of the Air contributed to this Ca|lamity.</P>
<P>After a greater Quantity of Rains than or|dinary had fallen in the Summer and Au|tumn, in tho&s;e Places where the Storm was felt, the Winter came on much warmer than u&s;ual; &s;o that the Liquor in a Thermometer, of which the 84th Degree notes Fro&s;t, never fell below the 100th
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. No. 289.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence we may very well believe, that the Atmo&s;phere was at that Time fill'd with Atoms of <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> out of the Vapours rais'd by the Heat from the moi&s;t Earth, which being variou&s;ly combined and agitated, gave that deadly Force to the Motion of the Air.</P>
<P>A Proof of this we have not only from the frequent <HI>Fla&s;hes</HI> of <HI>Lightning,</HI> ob&s;erved a little before the Storm, but al&s;o from what the Country People took Notice of the next Day, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Gra&s;s and Twiggs of the Trees, in Fields remote from the Sea, ta&s;ted very &s;alt, &s;o that the Cattle wou'd not feed on them.</P>
<P>Our Hi&s;tories mention another Storm, which if not equal to this la&s;t in Violence, is how|ever thought the greate&s;t that had then ever been known and memorable from the Time at which it happened, <HI>viz.</HI> on the 3d of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> 1658, the Day on which the U&s;urper <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> died.</P>
<P>No <HI>Ephemerides</HI> that I know of relate the
<PB N="31" REF="30">Condition of the Air that Year, but it is &s;uf|ficient to remark, That whatever other Cau&s;es concurr'd, their Force was accompanied with a <HI>Full Moon,</HI> ju&s;t before the Time of the <HI>Au|tumnal Equinox.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame Score it comes to pa&s;s, That in tho&s;e Countries which are &s;ubject to frequent <HI>Inundations,</HI> the&s;e Calamities are ob|&s;erved to happen at the Time of the <HI>Moon</HI>'s greate&s;t Influence, &s;o that the learned <HI>Baccius</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Del</HI> Tevere, lib. 3. p. 228.</NOTE> has rightly enough laid the Cau&s;e of &s;uch Mi&s;chiefs upon immoderate <HI>Tides of the Ocean,</HI> being unhappily accompanied with the <HI>attrac|tive Force</HI> of &s;ome or other <HI>Stars.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Childrey,</HI> in his <HI>Britannia Baconica</HI>
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Pag. 97.</NOTE>, has from &s;everal In&s;tances &s;hewn the <HI>Lunar</HI> Action in Damages of this Kind.</P>
<P>Such and the like <HI>Natural</HI> Cau&s;es have <HI>Storms</HI> and <HI>Tempe&s;ts;</HI> for as to the Que&s;tion of Di|vine Power, whether or no Calamities of this Kind do not &s;ometimes, by the Anger of Heaven, happen out of the Cour&s;e of Na|ture, it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;pute, nor would I by any means endeavour to ab&s;olve Mens Minds from the Bands of Religion. For although we mu&s;t allow all the Parts of the Machine of this World to be framed and moved by e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws, and that the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition of its Fabrick, which is mo&s;t bene|ficial to the whole, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity, in &s;ome few Places now and then occa&s;ion Hurts and Mi&s;chiefs; it is however mo&s;t highly rea&s;on|able, that we &s;hould yield to the Supreme
<PB N="32" REF="31">Creator an ab&s;olute Power over all his Works; Concluding withal, that it was perhaps agree|able to Divine Wi&s;dom, to order the Make of the World after &s;uch a Manner, as might &s;ometimes bring Mi&s;chiefs and Calamities upon Mankind, whom it was nece&s;&s;ary by the Frights of <HI>Storms, Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightning</HI> to keep in a continual Sen&s;e of their Duty.</P>
