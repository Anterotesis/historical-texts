<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE Phy&s;icians in the Commi&s;&s;ion for Sick and Wounded Seamen.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE World, I know, will admire what Merit of yours &s;hould obtain you this Addre&s;s; but their Curio&s;ity will be &s;atisfied when they are told, that your Pretences on this Head are very great and &s;ingular. <HI>You pretend to be compleat Ma&s;ters of all the Quali|ties that ever were found about a Med'cine; and that you never fail to determine all its po&s;&s;ible Actions by this Infallible Light.</HI> If this proves not a &s;ufficient Apology for me, you your &s;elves mu&s;t find a better.</P>
<P>Indeed the former Di&s;appointments that Sedulous Inquirers have met with already in this Way, were enough to di&s;credit my A&s;&s;ertion; but e&s;pecially that &s;uch Ab&s;tru&s;e Methods are po&s;&s;e&s;t by People who are as unknown as they have endeavour'd to be otherwi&s;e; but in that you mu&s;t give them further Sa|tisfaction. 'Tis enough for me to have made this part of the Di&s;covery, but you mu&s;t tell them more.</P>
<P>For this Trial, I do not give you the My&s;tery of a <HI>No&s;trum</HI> to re&s;olve, neither have I put &s;tranger Drugs into your Hands, nor &s;ome foreign Root that came but lately from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> No, I have fir&s;t given you a Bark that is the mo&s;t Excellent of any Med'cine for the Di&s;ea&s;e it is to Cure; which owes its Di&s;covery to wild Indians, its &V;&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI> to Churchmen, and its Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, after the Malice of Phy&s;icians to de&s;troy it, to an Empyrick, and which now Triumphs in this next Age with the great Applau&s;e of Phy&s;icians; tho' their Predece&s;&s;ors wou'd never &s;ubmit to the Conque&s;t; nay, its Native Strength equals at lea&s;t the be&s;t Preparations of it, on Purpo&s;e to &s;how how it rais'd its Reputation in &s;pite of the Fathers, and will have no farther to do with the Sons than to re|ceive their Submi&s;&s;ion. And I am a&s;ham'd to think how little Thanks Men owe us that have hinder'd them &s;o long from the Benefit of &s;o great a Good: But the following Story does prove how well we are &s;atisfied with the Thing, and how &s;till we have neglected &s;uch Di&s;coveries that might a&s;&s;i&s;t us to give it to more Advantage. But it is this you put us in hope of being in&s;tructed in by you.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>The Preface.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay no more of the other Two In&s;tances I give, than that they are of an Older Date than to bear any Exception again&s;t our Opportunity of making Experiment about 'em.</P>
<P>Yet while I clear my Examples from Objections that may be brought again&s;t their Propriety of being &s;uch, I am &s;en&s;ible how ready &s;ome Peo|ple may be to object again&s;t my thus expo&s;ing the &V;ncertainty of Med'cines; but one An&s;wer may be, that it is in order to our arriving at a greater Certainty: But next, who but &s;uch <HI>Pretenders</HI> ever wou'd have the World think that our Knowledge of them is Infallible? Don't the frequent Attempts, and as frequent Di&s;appointments, of worthy Phy&s;icians, Prove this very &V;ncertainty: Some indeed have attempted Med'cines by their <HI>Qualities,</HI> and have all mi&s;carried in the Enterprize; but the&s;e Gentle|men, who promi&s;e n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w to attempt, and I wi&s;h they do not fail in that. Other Phy&s;icians have tried to di&s;&s;ect Bodies for the very Parts of their Compo&s;iti|on: But a Noble Gentleman, well skill'd in all the&s;e Trials, has &s;ufficient|ly de&s;troyed that Pretence in his Sceptical Chymi&s;t; and it was only this Gentleman who was the be&s;t able, as well as the mo&s;t proper Per&s;on, to do it.</P>
<P>But if the Strength of this Objection is conceal'd under the fear of di&s;co|vering &s;o much of our Weakne&s;s to the World, the Argument is as weak as the Defence of it is unworthy of a Man. A Cheat has the wor&s;t Grace upon a Gentleman of any thing; and I am convinc'd that both Phy&s;ick and Phy&s;icians have really &s;uffer'd more by the mode&s;t conniving at &s;uch Tricks of Pretenders, than ever they can &s;uffer by this Frank Declaration of mine. This is the Foundation for Quacks and Mountebanks, who know no better where to &s;et up for a Character. Men of Learning go quite another Way to Work; they do not apprehend their being e&s;teem'd to know nothing except they pretend to know every thing: Their rea&s;oning is quite the Rever&s;e of this. They &s;ay that there are &s;ome things of which they know nothing at all, and the&s;e are the&s;e fir&s;t <HI>Qualities,</HI> or <HI>Phy&s;ical Cau&s;es,</HI> the&s;e Gentle|men know &s;o perfectly wel'. Some things they know but Probably, and among them may be the Doctrine of Med'cines: But &s;ome other things they know Demon&s;tratively, and among them are &s;ome things about the Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>From all which I &s;hall ob&s;erve, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That <HI>the Knowledge by Qua|lities is as Vain as it is an Ignorant Pretence.</HI></P>
<P>And, 2dly, <HI>That they who &s;et up on this Foot, know nothing at all, not &s;o much as where to lodge their Pretence: And they are a Peo|ple who commonly Practice Phy&s;ick with a Contempt of all Theo|ries of Di&s;ea&s;es, and you &s;ee they do it with an ab&s;olute Ignorance about Med'cines.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Pre&s;ent Uncertainty IN THE Knowledge of Med'cines.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I come to Prove the Charge of Uncertainty on our Knowledge of Med'cines, 'twill be Nece&s;&s;ary to lay down &s;ome Rules that may be U&s;e|ful in examining the Matter of Fact. And the&s;e &s;hall be taken from the De|&s;criptions of the Two different Sorts of Knowledge a Phy&s;ician is &s;aid to have; <HI>viz.</HI> Experimental and Scientifical; or, a Knowledge of Experience and Science. By knowing the Virtues or Powers of Med'cines in the Fir&s;t Way, we know that &s;uch and &s;uch Med'cines are Recom|mended
<PB N="2" REF="5">for, and are good or bad in, Par|ticular Di&s;ea&s;es, and different Circum|&s;tances of the Di&s;temper, when either they have good Succe&s;s, no Succe&s;s, or an ill One. This is the lowe&s;t piece of Knowledge that can be expected from Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Or, Secondly, If by many &s;uch Experi|ments we &s;hould di&s;cover what Action it is in any Med'cine, whereby it pro|duces its Proper Effects, &s;o as to be able to deduce the good or bad Effects it will have, as &s;o many Corollaries from the Knowledge of the Action, That wou'd be as Noble a piece of Science as Phy&s;ick can be &s;uppo&s;ed to admit of, and wou'd con|tain all that is Nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the De&s;criptions, which are the Rules in the en&s;uing Trial, I &s;hall begin with all the Di&s;tinctne&s;s and Brevity imaginable.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the Bounds of a Letter will not allow me to try every &s;ingle Med'cine by it &s;elf, or indeed every Cla&s;s of Med'|cines in general; yet 'twill be more to your Satisfaction if I Prove it by Two or Three Examples of Med'cines, that are
<PB N="3" REF="6">either mo&s;t in U&s;e, or that produce mo&s;t con&s;tantly the &s;ame Effects, when the lea&s;t Caution is had about 'em, and are in every one's Hands; and if I can Prove our Knowledge of them to be ju&s;t nothing, and that it does not &s;o much as arrive at the Fir&s;t De&s;cription or Experience, I may Pre&s;ume to conclude the like Imper|fection to be, at lea&s;t as great, in our Know|ledge of Med'cines, that are not near &s;o frequently u&s;ed, nor that have not, by far, &s;o certain and con&s;tant Effects; nay, who&s;e Effects are mo&s;t uncon&s;tant in the be&s;t Hands.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t In&s;tance of this Imperfection &s;hall be of the Je&s;uits Pouder; a Med'cine that every one mu&s;t own to be the be&s;t for Curing intermitting Feavers; and with that Certainty, that no other known Med'cine can do the like in this or any other Di&s;ea&s;e; for it generally Cures, not only in the Hands of Phy&s;icians, but e'en in tho&s;e of Quacks, and Nur&s;es, by whom it is given with no manner of Judgment or Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Yet even this Pouder has been wanting in its Succe&s;s, and Agues have been known
<PB N="4" REF="7">&s;ometimes to &s;tand their Ground again&s;t many Charges of it. This is evident &s;ome|times here; but too often in <HI>Virginie.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis known that by the taking of it, &s;afe intermitting Feavers have been changed into tho&s;e that are continual; which are far more dangerous, and who&s;e Event is often very doubtful.</P>
<P>And it is very &s;urpri&s;ing that this Turn of the Di&s;ea&s;e is not always in the &s;ame manner; for by Je&s;uits Pouder Agues have degenerated into unweildy Rheuma|ti&s;ms, or a lazy Jaundice; nay, &s;ometimes it has terminated in a &s;udden Death.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;trange and uncon&s;tant Ef|fects of Je&s;uits Pouder. It Cures an Ague the be&s;t of any thing; it turns the Patient &s;ometimes out of one Di&s;ea&s;e into another; and &s;ometimes it kills him.</P>
<P>But this is not all; it will &s;ometimes make him Co&s;tive; it Purges him; it Sweats him; yet it never has been ranked among Med'cines of the&s;e Sorts, but once to Di&s;parage it.</P>
<P>And this is the Rare Med'cine which Cures us &s;o &s;uddenly, that it &s;eems to O|perate almo&s;t like a Charm, that yet has &s;uch &s;trange, tho' &s;eldom, ill Effects in the
<PB N="5" REF="8">Cure of the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e. But &s;ince dif|ferent Conditions and Circum&s;tances make all the Variety in this Affair, as well as in every thing el&s;e, Phy&s;icians ought to be very Indu&s;trious to find out what are the Conditions in this Ca&s;e, where we find &s;uch con&s;iderable Turns in Admini|&s;tring this Excellent Med'cine. For, per|haps if they were known, they might be avoided; at lea&s;t, if a Cure is to be had by any other Med'cine, that rather is to be tried; and it is at wor&s;t better not to attempt a Cure, than certainly to Kill.</P>
<P>'Tis to be thought, that if all, or any, of the&s;e ill Accidents that happen by u&s;ing the Bark had often been ob&s;erv'd, that no Rhetorick cou'd induce the World to per&s;i&s;t in taking it; yet &s;ince they have happen'd, they may happen again, and indeed every Day; it may therefore be thought very Expedient to know how ei|ther to give it &s;o as to avoid Danger and Mi&s;chief, or el&s;e to know when the Proper Time is when we are not to give it at all.</P>
<P>It was for want of this Knowledge the Bark lo&s;t its good Name, when Sir&mdash;<HI>&V;nder|wood,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="9">Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> died by taking of it, who&s;e untimely Death did &s;o terrifie his Relations, that no friezing or fryings of an Ague can ever be &s;trong enough to force them to take it.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince there is &s;o manife&s;t Uncer|tainty in the Practice of this Excellent Med'cine; be&s;ides the Danger of being killed; it mu&s;t be own'd that there ought to be a good deal of Di&s;cretion had when we u&s;e it. And he who is po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Di&s;cretionary Knowledge, mu&s;t be able to know, not only that it is un|certain, but this mu&s;t be warranted by my Fir&s;t Rule: He is obliged to know what Appearances, what Conditions, there were in the Di&s;ea&s;e; when the Bark Cu|red, and when it did not Cure; as al&s;o when One got a Jaundice by it, and a Third died. But if he has no Knowledge of tho&s;e Times, he is under a va&s;t Uncer|tainty in every Patient; neither does he know who&s;e Cure or Death he is carrying on with the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance, tho' he Practice with the be&s;t Med'cine.</P>
<P>I wou'd advi&s;e tho&s;e who think they can An&s;wer for this Sort of Knowledge,
<PB N="7" REF="10">to try their Strength by the Second Rule I propo&s;ed; but it is Time enough to do that when I find my Fir&s;t Reque&s;t an|&s;wer'd. Indeed by this Rule we have the mo&s;t delightful, as well as the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful, piece of Knowledge imaginable; for by it we might know what the Uni|form Action of the Bark is in it &s;elf, whereby it Cures an Ague, and we &s;hou'd be able to deduce the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs that are already ob&s;erv'd, as &s;o many Corol|laries from the Condition of the Di&s;ea&s;e; nay, by it are we made capable to &s;u&s;pect all the probable Dangers that can be, or perhaps have been, tho' they have e&s;cap'd the Caution of the Ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>The&s;e related Misfortunes that have happen'd by taking the Bark, are not the Calumnies it &s;tands charged with by its bigotted Enemies. There are many more; but the&s;e I have named have happened to many Candid Practitioners, and the mo&s;t of 'em Recorded by that Excellent Phy&s;ician Dr. <HI>Sydenham.</HI></P>
<P>But what can be &s;aid to the Pother had among many Authors about its under Actions of Purging, Sweating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when
<PB N="8" REF="11">they have Indu&s;triou&s;ly pa&s;t by &s;o Con|&s;iderable Effects of this Med'cine.</P>
<P>All the U&s;e I make of this Argument for the Pre&s;ent, is to &s;hew you that the Knowledge of Med'cines is as Ob&s;cure and Difficult as any thing el&s;e in Phy|&s;ick, notwith&s;tanding of a common O|pinion we entertain about their Certain|ty. And this I think is very manife&s;t by this Fir&s;t In&s;tance; becau&s;e our Know|ledge of the be&s;t Med'cine which an&s;wers Expectation mo&s;t con&s;tantly, and is more us'd than any one Med'cine, is very ob|&s;cure, and ju&s;t nothing at all.</P>
<P>This Argument might be pur&s;ued as Succe&s;sfully in every one of the Med'cines that are mo&s;t Familiar to us. In all Eva|cuating Med'cines, as well as in tho&s;e that produce no Evacuation, but are con&s;ide|rable for &s;ome great Effect of another kind; but &s;o Particular an Aggravation is by no means Nece&s;&s;ary, neither does the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion require it. I &s;hall content my &s;elf with an In&s;tance or Two more, which will be &s;ufficient to Prove my Argument about the real Uncertain|ty of Med'cines.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<P><MILESTONE N="Opium"> The next Example that I bring is of Opium; and I cannot help thinking it thus Uncertain, notwith&s;tanding of the late Endeavours of &s;ome Ingenious Au|thors, being there is not full Satisfaction given about its way of producing Sleep; and far more hardly are we pre&s;t when we endeavour to account for its Action when it hinders us from Sleep, and makes us Delirous.</P>
<P>Moreover, Opium is ob&s;erv'd to give a Check to all Sorts of Evacuations; yet great Evacuations have been known to be made by it.</P>
<P>'Tis noted for either relieving us of Pain, or at lea&s;t giving an agreeable re&s;pite from it, though great and torturing Pains have &s;ometimes been felt upon its Account: I mean not only tho&s;e Head|achs, and Pain at Stomach, it often occa|&s;ions, and that are felt after its &s;leeping force is over; but even &s;ome that come at fir&s;t taking, and that beyond all Pa|tience, and almo&s;t to Di&s;traction; yea, the&s;e Pains are al&s;o produced by every thing that makes Sleep, as well as by Opium, or any Preparation of it; and
<PB N="10" REF="13">the more Ob&s;tinately we per&s;i&s;t in that quieting De&s;ign, to greater Degrees we augment the Torture.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, Opium is not like other Med'cines &s;o ea&s;ily dos'd; and an exceeding quantity has wor&s;e Con&s;equences than any other Med'cine whatever. Nay, &s;ome|times when we wou'd give it to good Purpo&s;e, it is Nece&s;&s;ary to give Three or Four Grains at once, withour our coming Cautiou&s;ly, and by Degrees, to that Quan|tity; or that it is given to People who have been long accu&s;tomed to take it, (all which Con&s;iderations alter the Ca&s;e per|fectly), yet there is nothing more Certain, than that Three Grains have laid People of a proper Age into an Eternal Oblivi|on of this World; tho' the World &s;hould not forget him that gave it.</P>
<P>Now who wou'd not Purcha&s;e at any Rate a good Night's Re&s;t, after watching many Nights, and a long <HI>Vigilia?</HI> Who wou'd not rid them&s;elves of Trouble|&s;ome Pains, and unea&s;ie Evacuations, by taking Opium? But if the Danger that po&s;&s;ibly may come by it was ever imagin'd, how equal might the Di&s;pute prove a|bout
<PB N="11" REF="14">taking of it on any of the men|tioned De&s;igns; but e&s;pecially if the Ope|ration of this Med'cine &s;hou'd fall &s;hort of it; nay, if the contrary Effects were ever &s;uppos'd to happen. We ought to &s;uppo&s;e at lea&s;t that a very Extraordinary Pilot ought to be made Choice of, to guide us where &s;uch Hazards, and Things of &s;o great a Value, are; and more where our Per&s;ons may be fatally concern'd.</P>
<P>And therefore let any One who pre|tends to be familiarly acquainted with this Pacifick Med'cine, examine him&s;elf throughly by the Rules I have laid down, and re&s;t &s;atisfied with nothing le&s;s than his being qualified by the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it is &s;trange enough to hear Men Boa&s;t of a Certainty in Med'cines, &s;uch as requires no Direction from Rea&s;on to Manage beyond their Skill; and yet &s;uch con&s;iderable Doubts to remain at this Day about a Med'cine of &s;o manife&s;t Ef|fects, and of &s;o great and ancient a &s;tand|ing. Wherefore it is manife&s;t how pro|per an Example this is to Prove our Im|perfection about the Knowledge of Med'|cines.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="15">
<P>But no le&s;s an Imperfection may per|haps be found in another Ancient Method of Curing, which commonly is the ut|mo&s;t Skill, and la&s;t Re&s;ort of a Doctor, after other Experience and Med'cines have been practis'd to no Purpo&s;e. And after &s;o Honourable a Mention made of a Me|thod, every Body mu&s;t think it is only Proper to the <HI>Bath,</HI> as indeed I intend it. I mu&s;t not be thought to Depretiate either the bathing or drinking of Waters at <HI>Bath,</HI> which I do by no Means. On the contra|ry, I have a valuable and ju&s;t E&s;teem of 'em.</P>
<P>Only I do &s;ay, that this u&s;eful and an|cient Method is far from being &s;o &s;uffici|ently known, that we are able to reap all the Benefit of it, or to avoid all its Mi&s;|chiefs, as &s;hall be made appear immediate|ly by Particulars.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Bath."> As to its Antiquity, 'tis believed that People applied them&s;elves to it for Relief in their Maladies before the Romans were much known in <HI>Britain;</HI> yet if we com|pare what has been &s;aid of 'em, either as to their Warmth or Medicinal Effects, by Ancient or Modern Writers, we &s;hall
<PB N="13" REF="16">find how little the&s;e have improv'd what the former a&s;&s;erted. <HI>Cambden</HI> informs us how Old <HI>Necham</HI> has conceived the Ob&s;er|vations of his Time about the&s;e Waters, for their U&s;e.</P>

<P>Then he, and mo&s;t Moderns after him, a&s;&s;ign this Rea&s;on for the Heat of the&s;e Waters.</P>
<Q>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d quid? Sulphurcum novimus e&s;&s;e locum.</Q>
<P>At pre&s;ent I am not bound to make all Proper Inquiries about the <HI>Bath;</HI> but in ge|neral, I will fir&s;t ob&s;erve how di&s;proporti|onable the Fame of the Cures it has work'd are to its long &s;tanding, and great Character given it by &s;ome Men. And, 2dly, The extream Changes its Reputation has &s;uf|fer'd in that Tract of Time: 'Thas often been e&s;teem'd a <HI>Panacea,</HI> and too frequent|ly thought good for nothing at all. And from both the&s;e Ob&s;ervations I conclude,
<PB N="14" REF="17">that if a moderate Knowledge of this Method had been join'd with half the good U&s;es of the&s;e Waters, they never cou'd have had &s;o great Ebbings in their Fame.</P>
<P>But to be more Particular; 'tis certain, that though Sulphur impregnating tho&s;e Waters, is told us to be the Cau&s;e of their Heat; yet our Knowledge of this Method of Nature is &s;o very ob&s;cure, that we can neither imitate her in medicating Wa|ters after that manner; nor by any Means make other Waters Serviceable to like Purpo&s;es. Wherefore it is al&s;o mani|fe&s;t how In&s;ignificant our boa&s;ted Know|ledge is, and to how little Purpo&s;e our Trials of 'em have been.</P>
<P>I know that there are Authors that Prove, and &s;ufficiently enough, that tho&s;e Waters contain more Sub&s;tances than Sul|phur; but the Difficulty remains the &s;ame, <HI>mutatis mutandis, viz.</HI> by taking the known <HI>Compo&s;itum,</HI> as I took Sulphur &s;ingly in the Argument.</P>
<P>But further, if I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that either the &s;ingle Ingredient of the&s;e Wa|ters, if there is but one, or a determin'd
<PB N="15" REF="18">Quantity of Ingredients, if more were known; yet it is certain we &s;hould be &s;till Ignorant of their Operations, if we know not the Effects of the&s;e &s;imple Sub|&s;tances, which being mixed with the Wa|ters, give 'em their Medicinal Qualities; and the Difficulty wou'd always encrea&s;e, when we were to account for their Combi|nation. This is manife&s;t from the Affair of Je&s;uits Pouder, i.e. it is manife&s;t that if the Particular Ingredients of the&s;e Waters were in Sub&s;tance and Quantity as evident to us as the Sub&s;tance and Quantity of Je|&s;uits Pouder, yet our Difficulties &s;hall &s;till remain un&s;atisfied, except we knew more of the Nature of the&s;e Sub&s;tances, that are the <HI>Compo&s;ita</HI> of the Waters, than we know of Je&s;uits Pouder; and I think we know le&s;s, and by Con&s;equence le&s;s al&s;o of the Waters, even &s;uppo&s;ing we knew their Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Bath</HI> is good for decay'd Old Age; for People that are Lame, and tho&s;e who labour under a Di&s;|ea&s;e from a Cold Cau&s;e; yet our Know|ledge about the <HI>Bath</HI> mu&s;t remain Uncer|tain, if we are not able to ju&s;tifie our &s;ending People thither on other Accounts,
<PB N="16" REF="19">for Rea&s;ons not yet a&s;&s;ign'd; and if we cannot &s;how that Effects quite con|trary to tho&s;e it is noted for have not hap|pen'd, with the Particular Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of the la&s;t Sort are adduced in a good Number by <HI>Bath</HI> Doctors; and though po&s;&s;ibly the Crutches that hang there may not be the Martyrology of the <HI>Bath,</HI> as Doctor <HI>Willis</HI> wou'd have it; yet they are confe&s;s'd not to be the Tro|phies of its con&s;tant Succe&s;s. But it is mo&s;t certain that we have not conveyed to us the Failings and cro&s;s Succe&s;&s;es which are ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;malle&s;t Degree of Certainty in this Affair.</P>
<P>Perhaps the &s;ending People for all Di&s;|ea&s;es may be alledg'd for its great U&s;e: And I do Concur with them who &s;ay &s;o, though I think very meanly of the Judg|ment of the Phy&s;icians who do &s;o; and am Po&s;itive, that how &s;oever excellent the <HI>Bath</HI> may be, that it neither is Infallible, nor a <HI>Panacea;</HI> but that it will always want a &s;uitable Direction, which will be the more Infallible the greater our Knowledge is.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="20">
<P>But the Weakne&s;s of our Under&s;tand|ings in this Particular is but too mani|fe&s;t by &s;ome Facts I &s;hall Adduce.</P>
<P>For we know that many People who have been for&s;aken in the Jaundice by their Phy&s;icians, have yet found their Health at <HI>Bath,</HI> though the <HI>Bath</HI> is accu&s;ed for bringing the Jaundice upon a great many.</P>
<P>It has been the common Complaint, e&s;pecially for the&s;e Two or Three la&s;t Years, that a va&s;t Number of People have got Rheumati&s;ms at <HI>Bath;</HI> it is notwith|&s;tanding mo&s;t inconte&s;tably True, that great Numbers have got rid of Rheuma|ti&s;ms there.</P>
<P>Many more Examples of other Di&s;ea|&s;es might be brought to Prove this Thing, be&s;ides the &s;udden Deaths that have hap|pen'd there; and yet I am apt to believe that it is very hard to account for the&s;e Accidents, even by my Rule of Experi|ence, which but too &s;ufficiently Proves the great Imperfection our Knowledge lyes under in this very Matter, of the mo&s;t ancient and u&s;eful Method of the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>But I am a&s;ham'd to think that this an|cient and u&s;eful manner of Bathing &s;hou'd
<PB N="18" REF="21">begin to be &s;o much neglected, as if it neither wanted, or did not de&s;erve our im|proving. No manner of Con&s;ideration is had about making it have its be&s;t U&s;e, which is &s;o little known, that &s;ome great Phy&s;icians are &s;candalou&s;ly Nice by giving the Waters by Spoonfuls: As if Old Ex|perience was to be laid a&s;ide to make way for &s;uch as they wou'd call New.</P>
<P>What Con&s;iderations are rais'd about <HI>Ba|thing?</HI> What Inquiries are made about our being <HI>Immerg'd</HI> in Water?

<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations are not only Fine, but U&s;eful, and wou'd &s;oon make us Ma|&s;ters of all that Affair. 'Tis &s;ure a Ma&s;ter|piece of Impudence to pretend to a Know|ledge very Particular of any Bath, and to remain Ignorant of the&s;e Particulars I have ju&s;t mention'd; nothing can be more &s;trange, except the &s;etting no Value upon &s;uch Inquiries, as tho&s;e Pretenders are ve|ry ready to do.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="22">
<P>But not to pre&s;s this Argument any far|ther, I may be apt to think that there can be no manner of Doubt about the great Imperfection of our Knowledge in re&s;pect of Med'cines; and how Ine&s;timable a good it wou'd be to be brought out of this In|firmity.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> to put an End to this Matter, I have not only given you Med'|cines of mo&s;t ancient and common U&s;e, but I have but ju&s;t nam'd &s;uch of their Ef|fects as are recorded by the be&s;t Authors; and which con&s;equently cannot probably be fal&s;e. 'Tis therefore your Bu&s;ine&s;s to give Satisfaction to the&s;e Examples I have Adduc'd, and that by your Quality-Method of <HI>Hot</HI> and <HI>Cold, Red</HI> and <HI>Yellow, Acid</HI> and <HI>Alkaly,</HI> by <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>Smell, &amp;c.</HI> or becau&s;e you love high Flights by the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of the&s;e Qualities; yet if you have any Regard to my conde&s;cending to give you a lower Method, I Challenge you to give &s;uch Proofs in Point of Experience that may a&s;&s;i&s;t our admini&s;tring them in Practice.</P>
<P>But while I &s;peak to your Method of Qualities, I mu&s;t inform you how Igno|rant your Pretence is in this Particular.
<PB N="20" REF="23">You pretend to determine the Power any Med'cine has to Cure a Di&s;ea&s;e only by knowing &s;ome of Its Notable Qualities, which is manife&s;tly fal&s;e; becau&s;e there is &s;carcely one Di&s;ea&s;e that has not Med'|cines of oppo&s;ite Qualities found u&s;eful in its Cure, and recommended to us by our Forefathers as &s;uch.</P>
<P>This is a Digre&s;&s;ion, but not an impro|per one; yet to proceed; is the previous Knowledge of a Med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cine, or of Med'cines, by its or their Qualities, nece&s;&s;ary before we Admini&s;ter them? And have you this kind of Knowledge? If you have, &s;how it us, for it is much wanting. If you have not, then require no more of others than you your &s;elves are Ma&s;ters of; and order as few Med'cines for the Publick as you do to Patients; and none to either of 'em till you have &s;atisfied us that you can do it in the mentioned Way.</P>
<P>But if you have any tolerating Method whereby you wou'd ju&s;tifie your admini|&s;tring Med'cines in your Probation Time, do as you wou'd be done by; &s;hare your Freedom to others of your Brethren, who are at lea&s;t in no lower a form of know|ing than you be.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="24">
<P>And if you have a &s;pecial Rule where|by you can prefer the U&s;e of one Med'cine to that of another, for the Cure of the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e: If you have, <HI>viz.</HI> any Me|thod for which you wou'd rather give Je&s;uits Pouder for the Cure of an Ague, than any of the other Med'cines recom|mended for the &s;ame: Let us have this your Method of rea&s;oning; for it may be &s;o exten&s;ive as to comprehend more Med'|cines in this and other Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>I know the Trite and Common Methods among Philo&s;ophers, and all Mankind, is fir&s;t to know if a thing is &s;o, and then how it is &s;o if we are able to compa&s;s it; but if they &s;hould not get this length, you mu&s;t reckon tho&s;e little better than Mad-men that deny the actual Exi&s;tence of a Thing, becau&s;e we do not know the Way of its Being. And but ju&s;t|ly, becau&s;e it wou'd have us disbelieve our Sen&s;es, and the Sen&s;es of all Man|kind; becau&s;e we cannot an&s;wer &s;ome Que&s;tions that are, or that happen not, to be the Objects of our Sen&s;es, and are too fine for our Under&s;tanding. So that in the Trial, if a Man, or a Thing, is, or
<PB N="22" REF="25">does, &s;uch an Action, or produces &s;uch an Effect, we mu&s;t judge of the&s;e Changes by our Eyes and other Sen&s;es, or take them upon the Te&s;timony of Hone&s;t Capable People that relate them, if we were not there our &s;elves. This is the Way of the World, and I &s;hall not enlarge upon it, to avoid Scandal: Tho' &s;o much I mu&s;t &s;ay, becau&s;e you and your Friend have &s;o boldly unhing'd all the&s;e common Ways of judging of pa&s;t Actions, that I am not able to go further with you, till you have inform'd us more in tho&s;e new Me|thods; yet whether you will do it or not, depend upon it, a Time may come where|in the World &s;hall be informed how you u&s;e their old ones in Matters of the great|e&s;t Importance.</P>
<P>Thus I bid you Farewel, knowing to how little Purpo&s;e it wou'd be to invite you to the following Di&s;cour&s;e. For you never once dreamt of any &s;uch thing; and your proper Talent is to Snarl in a Corner at &s;o Generous Attempts.</P>

<HEAD>A Po&s;t&s;cript to Phy&s;icians about the Nece&s;&s;ity of a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>I Continue the Di&s;cour&s;e to you on this Subject; not but that I am &s;en&s;ible how &s;eriou&s;ly <HI>many</HI> of you think of this Mat|ter. And that even they who Calumni|ate you on this Score, do them&s;elves pre|tend &s;ometimes to rea&s;on about this Affair; tho' at the &s;ame time they endeavour to per&s;wade the World, that all Rea&s;onings of this Nature are Vain, and but &s;o much Time lo&s;t to the improving of Practice. You are &s;en&s;ible how they a&s;&s;ume the quantity of Blood in a Man's Body given, and then do determine the Numbers of its Circulations in a certain Time: So you find, that how&s;oever they depreciate rea|&s;oning in your Ca&s;e about things of Phy|&s;ick, they are very fond of the Character of Men of Rea&s;on for them&s;elves; nay, you find they apply <HI>Arithmetick</HI> too, and therefore it is not rea&s;oning they are angry with, but that your Rea&s;on and Arith|metick is better than theirs.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="27">
<P>After the &s;ame manner they being told how Barbarous Indians Cure Yaws with <HI>Guaiacum,</HI> do immediately extend its U&s;e to the Eu|ropean <HI>Pox,</HI> and from that to <HI>Lepro&s;ies,</HI> &amp;c. This is in the Nature of Man to do; but it is the highe&s;t Ingratitude to Calumniate People that offer them more of &s;uch Med'|cines, or that wou'd teach them more na|tural and righter Methods, whereby this extending of their Knowledge may be more u&s;efully brought on.</P>
<P>And therefore it is that I wou'd per|&s;wade you to bear up again&s;t the Calum|nies of the&s;e ill Men, and continue to do good to Mankind, by improving your Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Be Diligent in your Enquiries about a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es; for it is even by that you &s;hall be greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in a&s;certaining your Knowledge of Med'|cines; and by that you &s;hall be brought beyond what Chance has put into your Hands.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if Med'cines were as certain in their Effects as our Hearts could wi&s;h, they can do but little good without a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es; but e&s;pecially in re|&s;pect of the good they do, when a&s;&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="25" REF="28">with it. And therefore I &s;hall take Leave to pre&s;s this Argu|ment a little farther to you than it is commonly done.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is very manife&s;t to tho&s;e who have thought the lea&s;t on that Subject; and I believe &s;ome time or other I may be able to give &s;ome Light into this Ab&s;tru&s;e Affair.</P>
<P>As to the 2d Particular, we find the whole World on our &s;ide in the main; for to what Purpo&s;e &s;hould an Infallible Med'cine &s;erve, if we knew not the Di&s;ea&s;e it Cures, when it appears upon us or our Neighbour? Suppo&s;ing, <HI>viz.</HI> it were as great a Difficulty to know an Ague in <HI>general,</HI> as it is to know it in <HI>all</HI> its Circum&s;tances, 'tis certain that this Excellent Med'cine, the Je&s;uits Pouder, &s;hould be of very little U&s;e to us.</P>
<P>So far I may be thought in the right; but next, no general De&s;cription that is almo&s;t po&s;&s;ible to be made of a Di&s;ea&s;e, can be of &s;ufficient U&s;e to us in admini&s;tring our Infallible Med'|cines, becau&s;e we are not always improperly Sick; but as a Di&s;temper at one Time may Kill us, yet it may Cure us of &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e at another: And if this is po&s;&s;ible, it is evident to every Common Under&s;tanding, that the more &s;urely any Med'|cine did promi&s;e the overthrow of a Di&s;ea&s;e, with the &s;ame certainty it brought along the impending Fate of the Sick Per&s;on. If Di&s;ea&s;es thus &s;ometimes Cure others that afflict us; and if we only want to have them de&s;crib'd in order to apply our tru&s;ty Remedy, as it is &s;uppos'd: It is mo&s;t manife&s;t that we do really hinder and ob&s;truct a perfect Cure of a Di&s;ea&s;e that &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;t by &s;ome other, if we did not endeavour to remove this curing Di&s;ea&s;e by a faithful Med'cine; and yet, perhaps, we rid our Patients of neither of them: Nay, the more Power|ful and Infallible the Med'cine is that we Employ, the more do we put it out of the Power of Nature, or the Strength of Con|&s;titution, to conquer the afflicting Di&s;temper, and the more <HI>Noxious</HI> Remedy. So that here appears a mighty Paradox, that one Di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould prove a Cure for another, and yet we never &s;hall be able to know when one Di&s;ea&s;e will be the Cure of another, but by a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es, which by mo&s;t is ridicul'd, and neglected by too many.</P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates,</HI> and all ancient Phy&s;icians, e&s;pecially, have fully prov'd this Paradox by their repeated <HI>Ob&s;ervations;</HI> and neither have <HI>they</HI> failed in their Truth among more Modern Phy&s;icians, who have thought ob&s;erving of any U&s;e. It will not be ami&s;s, I pre&s;ume, to give &s;ome Examples of this Matter:
<PB N="26" REF="29">and tho&s;e &s;hall be of that Nature, that the Di&s;ea&s;es I &s;hall name do mo&s;t e&s;pecially require the quicke&s;t Aid, and the mo&s;t cer|tain Ways of Curing; yet if even they are the Cures of other Di&s;ea&s;es, this whole Matter mu&s;t be true without Exception. <HI>Feavers, Dy&s;enteries, Drop&s;ies,</HI> &amp;c. are of this kind; and who wou'd not wi&s;h for an unerring Specifick for their Cure? Yet <HI>Hipp.</HI> &s;ays, That <HI>if a Feaver comes upon one afflicted with Convul|&s;ions, it Cures him of that Di&s;temper;</HI> and therefore who&s;oever does attempt to bani&s;h this Feaver with his Tru&s;ty Med'cine, mu&s;t, according to his Succe&s;s, either entail this Di&s;ea&s;e on his Patient, or de&s;troy him altogether, if Nature is not able to baffle both the Curer and the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Hippocrates</HI> exhorts us not to de&s;pair of a <HI>Mania|cal Mad</HI> Per&s;on when he <HI>begins</HI> to have a <HI>Dy&s;entery,</HI> or a <HI>Drop&s;ie,</HI> but to <HI>hope</HI> the better of his <HI>Recovery;</HI> and therefore if any one ob&s;erving the approach of any &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould turn to his Receipt book for a Cure, and &s;hould be happy enough to have an Excellent Med'cine for either of 'em, mu&s;t be the more mi&s;ta|ken in the Succe&s;s by the Sini&s;trous Application; for he does with great Certainty confirm the Madne&s;s on his Patient.</P>
<P>Moreover, great Vomitings, which are not only of fatal Con|&s;equence, but at once cut off all Hopes of &s;uccouring langui&s;h|ing Nature, do require the &s;peedie&s;t Care of the be&s;t Phy&s;ician, and the mo&s;t Infallible Methods; yet the&s;e are &s;ometimes of great Benefit when they come in the latter end of a <HI>Lco&s;ene&s;s</HI> of a long continuance, as the &s;ame <HI>Hippocrates</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, and con&s;tant Experience does vouch. And therefore, tho' <HI>Dy&s;ente|ries, Feavers, Drop&s;ies, Vomiting,</HI> &amp;c. be Di&s;ea&s;es that can of them&s;elves bring Life to its final Period, and do ju&s;tly require our utmo&s;t Study to di&s;cover their Nature, and to find out the be&s;t Methods and Med'cines for Curing 'em; yet they come &s;ometimes as the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;peedy Remedies for &s;ome other Di&s;tempers, which perhaps have already baffled all other Me|thods already, be&s;ides the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es that thus Cure: And there being no other Means left to &s;hake off the Di&s;temper, it mu&s;t &s;till continue to be dangerous, if the unhappy Curer has Suc|ce&s;s enough to baffle that Healing Di&s;ea&s;e; and thereis no Po&s;&s;i|bility of knowing a fatal Di&s;temper from the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> when it is to prove a Cure, but by knowing the nece&s;&s;ary Productions of Di&s;ea&s;es, and the particular Conditions of Human Bodies, in which they are produc'd, <HI>i.e.</HI> by having a true Theory of Di&s;|ea&s;es.
<PB N="27" REF="30">Wherefore a true and an accurate Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Thing for advancing a Phy&s;ician's Knowledge for Curing Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>But, 2dly, This Argument holds very &s;trong in re&s;pect of Idio|pathical and Sympathical Di&s;ea&s;es; for mo&s;t frequently the Di|&s;temper that makes the greate&s;t Figure is mo&s;t taken notice of, and frightens us the mo&s;t, is very dependent, and is &s;upported by a very &s;mall Cau&s;e, and yet it will continue frightful and threatning &s;o long as all our Applications are for this fearful Part; and its incon&s;idera|ble Cau&s;e remains unregarded, except in mid&s;t of this Bu&s;tle the Mi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute Occa&s;ion pa&s;&s;es off of it &s;elf, very much to the Reputation of the Malignant Curer, tho' little is added to the Stock of Phy&s;ick. There be Thou&s;ands of In&s;tances to prove this Thing; but I &s;hall be &s;atisfied to adduce One, becau&s;e it is Evident, and of great U&s;e, when extended to all its Length, and that it fully proves all I have &s;aid on this Head. The Example is this Ca&s;e of One, who having a Wound, there may be a very moderate Pain, and a Generation of <HI>Pus,</HI> and with this there will be a Feaver more or le&s;s to the Cau&s;es. This Fea|ver may be improv'd by a Feaver-Doctor, that the Suppuration &s;hall mi&s;carry, and the fatal Feaver get a mighty Strength: Whereas if he is le&s;s frightned with this Common Feaver, and has Patience or Art to &s;uffer the Suppuration to proceed, or to promote it by various Me|thods, his Fears will vani&s;h with the Feaver, which a&s;&s;uredly goes off in that order that the <HI>Pus</HI> does take place.</P>
<P>This Argument holds evidently in every thing that relates to the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es: For Di&s;ea&s;es are not only the Cures of Di&s;ea&s;es; and not only great Di&s;cretion is to be u&s;ed in di&s;covering an Idiopa|thical One; neither do we only admini&s;ter Infallible Remedies in un|due and un&s;ea&s;onable Times, having no better Guides than a general De&s;cription of Di&s;ea&s;es. But al&s;o, for not having a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es, we do not know when it is time to put a &s;top to our Suc|ce&s;sful Method; and but too frequently carry on a needle&s;s Practice, to the great Detriment and Hazard of the &s;ick Per&s;on. There may be &s;undry Examples brought for proving of this; but I &s;hall again con|tent my &s;elf with One: In the <HI>Jaundice, viz.</HI> who&s;e Patho|gnomonical Sign is mo&s;t commonly the <HI>Yellowne&s;s,</HI> as its very Name imports; yet this Yellowne&s;s is not <HI>always</HI> attending the Indi&s;po&s;ition, but does &s;ometimes continue when the &s;ick Per&s;on is free of the Di|&s;temper, and pa&s;t all Danger from the ill Accidents that &s;ucceed it; nay, frequently the Yellowne&s;s is augmented by &s;ome Methods that Cure the Di&s;ea&s;e: By which means the Cure is &s;till manag'd to the
<PB N="28" REF="31">Charge, Abhorrence and Danger of the Patient, and &s;till with the good Intention of an Ignorant Curer.</P>
<P>Whereas by a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es, it is not only ea&s;ie to de|termine when one is Yellow, and has the Jaundice, and when one is Yellow, and cur'd of the Jaundice. But under&s;tanding the Rea&s;on of both, he can de&s;troy the Yellowne&s;s, when no Con&s;ideration is hald to the fir&s;t Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I think this does very manife&s;tly convince us that there is &s;omething el&s;e Nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides Infallible Med'cines, for the Cure of Di&s;tem|pers; though at the &s;ame time the be&s;t Theories will Cure no Di&s;ea&s;e without Proper Remedies; and the more Excellent they are of their Kind, the more Valuable they are.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> This Matter will appear manife&s;tly, and at once to our View, if we do but reflect on the various and oppo&s;ite Sorts of Med'cines, that the faithful Ob&s;ervations of all former Ages have &s;ent us for the Cure of the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e. For the Variety &s;hows the Defect, as well as the Nece&s;&s;ity of trying about for more, and more certain, Med'cines: And the oppo&s;ite Sorts point out to us the Variety of Cir|cum&s;tances of the Di&s;temper: So that my former Gentleman, <HI>A&mdash;s,</HI> is &s;carcely initiated in the&s;e Matters, when he talks of a Med'cine of one Quality to Cure the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e. This in pa&s;&s;ing. An Example of this is every Di&s;ea&s;e. But I &s;hall In&s;tance in the Ca&s;e of a Con&s;umption, for which Experience has recom|mended a very notable Variety of Med'cines, and the&s;e very oppo&s;ite. Are we not told of <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Brim&s;tone, Bal&s;ams,</HI> and <HI>Attenuating</HI> Med'|cines, and a great Abundance of more jarring Things? But to give a fuller Example in this Particular, I refer you to what I have &s;aid on this Subject in my <HI>Alvi Profluvia:</HI> By all which it is very plain how in&s;ufficient the greate&s;t Stock of the be&s;t Med'cines is, without a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es, even for the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Let me therefore per&s;wade Candid and Hone&s;t Phy&s;icians to &s;et a|bout a &s;edulous Inquiry for a true Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es, and a more exact Method for di&s;covering the directe&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous U&s;es of good Med'cines, that we may do the mo&s;t good to Mankind, and &s;how that the Med'cines chance have put into our Hands, may even have &s;ome Improvement from us: Neither let us in this Inquiry be di&s;courag'd with the Impudence of Pretenders nor by the &s;mall Ad|vances we can hope to make; for they only hate you for your doing better than them&s;elves; and no Body can tell what attempting in this Matter does produce, but they that have once tried it.</P>
