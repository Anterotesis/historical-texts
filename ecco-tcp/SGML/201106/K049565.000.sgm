<HEAD>A TRACT UPON INDIGESTION, AND THE HYPOCHONDRIAC DISEASE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>dy&s;pep&s;ia</HI> of no&s;ologi&s;ts, namely, indige&s;tion; and the hypochondriac di&s;ea&s;e, the va|pours or low &s;pirits, are di&s;tempers generally &s;o blended with each other, and with the <HI>atonic,</HI> irregular, or flying gout,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my tract upon the gout.</NOTE> that I have univer|&s;ally
<PB N="4" REF="3">found the medicine here re|commended to mitigate the various &s;ymptoms, and invigorate the whole habit, where it was u&s;ed for a due length of time in proper do&s;es, and when the patients &s;trictly pur&s;ued the rules of regimen and exerci&s;e which I pre&s;cribed: but when the gout has ab&s;olutely &s;eized the &s;to|mach, then the other more power|ful tincture mu&s;t be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered and un|der&s;tood when I &s;ay that <HI>dy&s;pep&s;ia</HI> and <HI>hypochondria&s;is</HI> are generally blended with the <HI>atonic</HI> gout, that I confine my&s;elf chiefly to per&s;ons who never, or very rarely and im|perfectly, have had the inflammatory affection of the joints, viz. the re|gular gout in the extremities.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>To prove what I have advanced it is only nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate the &s;ymptoms of <HI>dy&s;pep&s;ia</HI> or in|dige&s;tion, and of <HI>hypochondria&s;is,</HI> and then compare them with the &s;ymptoms of the <HI>atonic</HI> or flying gout.</P>
<P>The chief &s;ymptoms of indige&s;|tion are a diminution of the appe|tite of hunger, loathing of food, nau&s;ea, frequent inclination to reach, or &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, com|monly in the morning, and fre|quently at the &s;ight, or &s;mell, or even bare mention of particular di&s;hes, which, when the &s;tomach was in proper order, and dige&s;tion and chylification were duly per|formed, not only had no &s;uch effect, but u&s;ed to be gratifying; cructa|tion, four belchings and heart|burn;
<PB N="6" REF="5">fullne&s;s of the &s;tomach, with a grumbling noi&s;e in the bowels cau&s;ed by the motion of wind or air in the inte&s;tines; gnawing pains about the region of the &s;tomach, generally attended with co&s;tivene&s;s; confu&s;ed head-achs; anxiety and oppre&s;&s;ions at the heart, with fre|quent hiccups and palpitations; a &s;en&s;e of wearine&s;s, faintne&s;s, and aver&s;ion to motion, or active un|dertakings; &s;ometimes pains in the back and loins, with a general ful|ne&s;s of the lower belly; irregular appetites and &s;trange cravings; al&s;o diarrhoea, or loo&s;ene&s;s, accompanied with colic pains and gripings, wa&s;t|ing of the whole body, univer&s;al debility, relaxation, lo&s;s of tone, and flabbine&s;s of all the mu&s;cular or fle&s;hy parts.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;ufferings of the body, the temper and mind are often wonderfully affected. The patient becomes peevi&s;h and touchy at mere trifles; dejected, timid, di&s;tru&s;tful; bereft of hope as to his cure, and all future events; with aver&s;ion to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In <HI>hypochondria&s;is,</HI> be&s;ides the foregoing &s;ymptoms of indige&s;tion, the patient is &s;ometimes attacked with a copious &s;pitting, like unto a &s;alivation; with various &s;pa&s;ms, cramps, and pains about the che&s;t, &s;houlders, and back. Moreover the mind and temper are generally more affected by whim, fear, de&s;ponden|cy, and apprehen&s;ion of a thou&s;and horrors and evils; di&s;turbed &s;leep, dreadful dreams, to&s;&s;ing and watch|fulne&s;s during the night. The pa|tient
<PB N="8" REF="7">&s;hall be cro&s;s-grained, and &s;nappi&s;h at times without cau&s;e; and at other times he &s;hall mani|fe&s;t all the goodne&s;s and kind heart|edne&s;s of human nature. Very ge|nerally no per&s;ua&s;ion can have any effect in removing his very di&s;mal and fixed expectation of a variety of evils which will never come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>If we compare &s;ome of the prin|cipal &s;ymptoms of each of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;hall di&s;cover a near and &s;triking re&s;emblance between them. For in the <HI>atonic</HI> gout there are pretty con&s;tantly very marked &s;ymptoms of hypochondria&s;is, as dejection of &s;pirits, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, ti|midity, di&s;tru&s;tfulne&s;s, ficklene&s;s, caution and care about ab&s;olute trifles; wa&s;pi&s;hne&s;s, and &s;ometimes apparent rudene&s;s to inferiors, a
<PB N="9" REF="8">want of kind and civil attention and good breeding to equals, with indifference and great &s;hyne&s;s to &s;trangers; all the great powers and generous pa&s;&s;ions of the mind being &s;ubdued by the depre&s;&s;ing influence of melancholy, and the conception of a variety of evils, &s;anta&s;tical, and groundle&s;s&mdash;&s;hadows and non|entities being repre&s;ented to the mind as &s;erious realities, and mag|nified into the mo&s;t important con|cerns.</P>
<P>Such a mi&s;erable &s;tate of mind de&s;erves and demands our mo&s;t &s;incere commi&s;eration; and our be&s;t offices and abilities &s;hould be ex|erted to palliate and remove it. It ought to be a great con&s;olation, however, that although the &s;uffer|ings of the patient be very di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing,
<PB N="10" REF="9">yet the danger is in a great mea&s;ure imaginary; and that his cure re&s;ts and depends as much up|on his own conduct, as upon the attention and &s;kill of his phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>It is not unworthy of ob&s;ervation that hypochondriacs generally po&s;|&s;e&s;s the be&s;t rudiments of health and longevity notwith&s;tanding the apparent flim&s;ine&s;s and crazine&s;s of their con&s;titutions; and that when in a company they like, if the cap|tious humour be ab&s;ent, many will not only &s;hine and excel in vivacity and &s;prightline&s;s of fancy, off-hand wit, and an aptne&s;s and rapidity in arranging their ideas; but often rai&s;e our admiration by their ela|borate and ab&s;tru&s;e thoughts, their depth of under&s;tanding, and the
<PB N="11" REF="10">coherence and &s;olidity of their ar|guments.</P>
<P><HI>Dy&s;pep&s;ia,</HI> or indige&s;tion; the hypochondria&s;is, or low &s;pirits; and the <HI>atonic,</HI> or flying gout, appear more generally among men of learn|ing, genius, and property, who&s;e minds are con&s;tantly upon the rack of thought, than among the illite|rate, the &s;tupid, and the indigent, who &s;eldom experience the fatigue of &s;tudy, the labour of reflection, or any cares but &s;uch as are nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;upply of the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>And even among per&s;ons of the fir&s;t de&s;cription, tho&s;e who are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of fine &s;en&s;ibility, and irrita|bility, of great vivacity, &s;pirits, and ready wit, are more liable to the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es than tho&s;e who appear
<PB N="12" REF="11">on all occa&s;ions ea&s;y, carele&s;s and unconcerned; who have no hu|mane and tender feelings, and up|on who&s;e hardened hearts the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es and calamities of human na|ture make no impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Inten&s;e thinking, or the labour of the brain, therefore, which ex|hau&s;ts the fine&s;t &s;pirits, the nervous influence, the pabulum cogitationis the <HI>internuncii</HI> of the &s;oul, (call it what you will) while the whole body remains inactive, and the mu&s;cular &s;y&s;tem relaxed, mu&s;t be a powerful remote cau&s;e of hypochon|dria&s;is, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions of hatred, envy, malice, love, fear, jealou&s;y, anger, &amp;c. immoderate care, grief, trou|bles, and di&s;appointments, &s;tudy, night-watching, clo&s;e application
<PB N="13" REF="12">to bu&s;ine&s;s requiring deep thought; exce&s;s in venery; exce&s;&s;ive drink|ing of warm watery fluids; fre|quent intoxication, and immode|rate and &s;umptuous meals; chewing and &s;moking of tobacco, which ex|hau&s;ts that &s;aliva requi&s;ite for dige&s;|tion; a &s;edentary, inactive and in|dolent life, contribute likewi&s;e to the production of the&s;e maladies, and ought carefully to be avoided.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that the tem|perature and gravity, or &s;pring of the air, and its dryne&s;s and moi&s;ture have wonderful effects upon hypo|chondriacs. Tho&s;e who are not con&s;cious of this, and who pay no attention to the changes and feel|ings which take place in their bo|dies, by the ri&s;ing and falling of the mercury in the barometer, and
<PB N="14" REF="13">by particular winds, are apt to attribute their &s;ufferings either to the nature of their own di&s;tem|per, to their own conduct, or to the want of attention, management, and &s;kill of their phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>It is not unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, that in the above di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>dy&s;pep&s;ia</HI> and <HI>hypochondria&s;is</HI> e&s;pecially, the patients are apt to harbour many incoherent, whim&s;ical, and ground|le&s;s notions concerning the cau&s;e of their di&s;order. Some per&s;ons will fancy, and in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the cau&s;e of all their complaints is a &s;corbutic humour in the blood which is thrown upon the offending parts, as the &s;tomach, and bowels, &amp;c. others imagine the cau&s;e to be &s;ome relics of in&s;ection, or the dregs of &s;ome violent and acute
<PB N="15" REF="14">di&s;ea&s;e which they have had twenty or thirty years before. Some will have the cau&s;e to be &s;eated in the internal &s;urface of the oe&s;ophagus and &s;tomach; others in the liver and gall-bladder; others in the pan|creas and &s;pleen; &s;ome again in the me&s;entery and &s;mall guts only, with &s;chirrho&s;ity of the lacteal and lymphatic glands; and others, in the great guts and rectum, with ob&s;tructions in the&s;e different or|gans; convul&s;ions, cramps, &s;pa&s;ms, pullings, pinchings of the navel; gripings and twi&s;ting of the guts; and (becau&s;e &s;trong purges abrade and di&s;charge the natural mucus which lines, &s;heathes and defends the inner coats of the inte&s;tines from the &s;timulus of acrimonious mat|ter, &amp;c.) vi&s;cid phlegm glewing up
<PB N="16" REF="15">the pa&s;&s;ages and filling the bowels with hardened excrement, balls, &amp;c. with a variety of &s;imilar hypotheti|cal ab&s;urdities, which frequently have no exi&s;tence but in the minds of the patients.</P>
<P>As it is not to be expected that every per&s;on can have philo&s;o|phy, fortitude and &s;elf-denial enough to avoid and ab&s;tain from all the remote cau&s;es of indi|ge&s;tion and hypochondria&s;is, &s;o a complete and what is called a <HI>radi|cal cure</HI> is an affair of a doubtful nature. But if the patient will follow &s;ome of the principal rules I &s;hall here give, and continue to take the remedy according to the directions given with it, he may depend upon enjoying a far better &s;tate of mind, temper, and con&s;titu|tion
<PB N="17" REF="16">than he at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; and, probably, go through life to a good old age, with a &s;hare of comfort and happine&s;s he might have but little expected. To &s;often and mi|tigate the various natural evils which in many in&s;tances render this life a load, while it yet la&s;teth, is &s;urely well de&s;erving of any pains and attention that can be be&s;towed by a rational being.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a peculiar &s;pecies of <HI>hypochondria&s;is</HI> and <HI>hy&s;teria,</HI> no|thing need be advanced in this tract. As they proceed from very different cau&s;es they require a different treat|ment. They mu&s;t be relieved by a method altogether different from that which I have taken the liberty to recommend for the cure of the maladies I have been de&s;cribing.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<P>It is remarkable that eunuchs ne|ver, or very rarely, have the gout, or become hypochondriacs.</P>
<P>In <HI>dy&s;pep&s;ia</HI> and <HI>hypochondria&s;is</HI> it is very certain that the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines have lo&s;t their natural tone and energy; that the peri&s;taltic or propul&s;ive motion of the alimentary canal is greatly dimini&s;hed and weakened; that the office, or func|tion of dige&s;ting the food, &s;o as to produce that bland nutritious chyle, a&s;&s;imilated into the animal nature, is deranged and imperfect; and that, from this lo&s;s of tone and energy in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, the liquor or ferment of dige&s;tion in the &s;tomach is &s;o changed, and be|come &s;o peculiarly acid, that, in&s;tead of di&s;po&s;ing the aliments to di&s;&s;olve or dige&s;t into the animal nature,
<PB N="19" REF="18">it very evidently throws them into a kind of vinous fermentation; in which proce&s;s a great quantity of fixed and other air or wind is &s;epa|rated; and remaining &s;till hard and undige&s;ted, nature, con&s;idering them as extraneous &s;ub&s;tances, brings on nau&s;ea, or &s;ickne&s;s, to eject them by vomiting; or, if &s;uch <HI>inge&s;ta</HI> pa&s;s from the &s;tomach into the guts, from the lo&s;s of tone, want of a pro|per and natural &s;timulus, and from the dimini&s;hed energy of the peri|&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, they become a mere load; and it is often a long time before they can make their way to the natural outlet. During their pa&s;&s;age from the <HI>pylorus</HI> to the <HI>anus,</HI> not being di&s;po&s;ed to mix with the &s;olvents of bile and pancreatic juice, they yield very lit|tle
<PB N="20" REF="19">nouri&s;hing chyle; and, ferment|ing in their own way, the bowels are filled and di&s;tended with air con|tinually evolving from them, till their expul&s;ion. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, to ea&s;e the patient of his &s;ufferings, if no loo&s;ene&s;s occur, it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary to admini&s;ter vomits, and purges or cly&s;ters; by the repetition of which the whole alimentary canal becomes in&s;en&s;ible to every common &s;timulus; &s;o that without &s;trong e|metics, dra&s;tic purges, and very &s;timulating cly&s;ters, the patient can have neither comfort nor &s;tools; and thus the body being deprived of its due nouri&s;hment, and the brain and nerves of &s;pirits, the patient be|comes at length entirely emaciated, mi&s;erable in mind and body; and too frequently recurring to the la&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="20">wretched re&s;ource, &s;pirituous and intoxicating liquors, and inefficacious cordials, finally &s;inks under the pre&s;|&s;ure of his misfortunes and afflic|tions.</P>
<P>It is to be taken notice of, that all the &s;ymptoms I have enumerated, never take place at one time, in any one per&s;on.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The CURE.</HEAD>
<P>If &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, and reach|ing or vomiting, be the principal &s;ymptoms, with a want of appetite; and if the&s;e have been of long dura|tion, or the con&s;equences of repeated exce&s;s, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to clean&s;e the &s;tomach by drinking ca|momile tea, or by an emetic; after which, every morning, an hour at lea&s;t before breakfa&s;t, let the patient ink either a &s;mall tumbler-ful of
<PB N="22" REF="21">a cold infu&s;ion of camomile flowers, or about half a pint of pure cold water: then, if the weather and other circum&s;tances admit of it, let him take a walk for the &s;pace of half an hour or &s;o, and return to breakfa&s;t; which may con&s;i&s;t of water gruel, with a &s;poonful of rum, &s;ome crumbs of toa&s;t, and, if the &s;tomach can bear them, a little butter and &s;ugar, or &s;alt; or his breakfa&s;t may be tea and toa&s;t only; or it may be panada, or thin weak broth, with a gla&s;s of mountain, &s;herry, or madeira in it, and &s;ome toa&s;t or a cru&s;t of well-baked bread. After breakfa&s;t let him u&s;e that kind of exerci&s;e which not only employs the body, but al&s;o engages the attention, for an hour or more.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on travelling in ge|neral,
<PB N="23" REF="22">or through &s;uch a country as England, from town to town, as it affords a variety of new and curious objects, and draws off the attention of the mind from infirmities and bo|dily &s;ufferings, is always highly u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Every day at noon, or an hour or two before dinner, I beg leave to advi&s;e the patient to take one table &s;poonful of my tincture, unmixed, and by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>At dinner let him eat of fi&s;h, or of any &s;imple and tender meat, that quantity which &s;hall be le&s;s than he can and de&s;ires to eat. Of his bread, which mu&s;t be thoroughly baked, he ought to eat but little. He mu&s;t either ab&s;tain altogether from ve|getables and fruit, or eat a &s;mall quantity of &s;uch as he finds to be of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; of chee&s;e very little;
<PB N="24" REF="23">his drink during the meal &s;hould be fair water with a toa&s;t. Every thing he eats mu&s;t be minutely and thoroughly ma&s;ticated and chewed into a &s;mooth pulp before deglutition.</P>
<P>After dinner, he may, if he choo&s;e, drink three or four gla&s;&s;es of &s;ome generous wine, or rum, brandy, or true geneva mixed with water, a few bits of &s;ugar and pre|&s;erved bitter orange peel being added; the proportion &s;hould be one gla&s;s of &s;pirits to four gla&s;&s;es of water.</P>
<P>At &s;ix or &s;even o'clock in the evening he may drink two or three di&s;hes of tea, or &s;ome coffee; the black tea, as congou or &s;ouchong, will be be&s;t.</P>
<P>His &s;upper &s;hould be very trifling
<PB N="25" REF="24">indeed; he may eat, if &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, a very little of any thing there may be at table, which he knows to be of a light nature. He &s;hould pre|fer toa&s;t and water for his drink, but if he be fond of malt liquor, let him never exceed a pint of the be&s;t and cleare&s;t old porter, which &s;hould by no means be &s;tale and hard.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, if he wi&s;h for &s;ome|thing, let him drink a few gla&s;&s;es of warm rum and water, mixed as above.</P>
<P>When he goes to bed if he &s;hould be unea&s;y at &s;tomach in con&s;equence of wind or pains, let him take one table &s;poonful of the tincture, and then go to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The day following he mu&s;t pro|ceed as before, and per&s;evere in
<PB N="26" REF="25">&s;uch a plan of temperance, mode|ration, exerci&s;e, and amu&s;ements, till he &s;hall have acquired a better &s;tate of health, when he mu&s;t ne|ver, or as &s;eldom as may be, com|mit any exce&s;s. His exerci&s;e &s;hould never be carried to &s;uch a degree as to induce fatigue or a &s;en&s;e of wearine&s;s; and his amu&s;ements mu&s;t be of that nature which &s;hall pro|mote cheerfulne&s;s and rational mirth, taking care never to be al|together idle, and in a &s;tate of <HI>ennui;</HI> that is never to be &s;o thoroughly va|cant and lo&s;t as to have the <HI>fidgets,</HI> and not to know what to do with him&s;elf or how to &s;pend and kill his time.</P>
<P>Every time he &s;hifts him&s;elf let him have his body well chafed and
<PB N="27" REF="26">rubbed by a &s;tiff fle&s;h-bru&s;h till he feel an univer&s;al glow.</P>
<P>If co&s;tivene&s;s be the principal &s;ymptom, let the patient take a &s;inall do&s;e of phy&s;ic before he be|gins with the tincture, and then proceed as above.</P>
<P>That kind of food which yields much nouri&s;hment, and is ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, is always to be preferred, becau&s;e of &s;uch aliment a le&s;s quantity will &s;uffice, and the &s;tomach will not be loaded, nor the bowels di&s;tended with air.</P>
<P>The patient &s;hould always fini&s;h his meal before the appetite of hun|ger &s;hall be &s;atisfied; that is, he &s;hould be able to &s;ay, I could eat more, but I will not.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t never add another meal to one yet undige&s;ted: of all ab&s;ur|dities
<PB N="28" REF="27">and evils in relation to the above di&s;ea&s;es, none are greater than eating when one is not hungry, and drinking when one is not dry. There mu&s;t be no drinking between meals; no reli&s;hes nor gills of wine before dinner; &s;uch a habit is <HI>felo de &s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Stock fi&s;h is a nouri&s;hing food of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, and it will agree with, and be proper for many pa|tients, once or twice a week.</P>
<P>Cold bathing, as it &s;trengthens and braces the whole body, will be very beneficial.</P>
<P>Electricity quickens the circula|tion, and increa&s;es per&s;piration and all the excretions; and &s;parks taken from the belly, or the application of elec|tric friction over the whole abdomen, will &s;trengthen the alimentary canal remove ob&s;tructions of the ab|dominal
