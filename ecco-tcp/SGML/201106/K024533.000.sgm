<PB REF="2">
<P>A Praeternatural curvature of the bones generally produces &s;ome di&s;orders in the oeconomy of the human body; but, that of the &s;pine in par|ticular, gives ri&s;e to the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms, which may lead on to the death of the patient: this will not appear &s;ur|pri&s;ing, if we con&s;ider the importance of tho&s;e functions, which may be ob&s;tructed or injured in this di&s;ea&s;e; for from the union of all the vertebrae together, a bony pyra|mid pre&s;ents it&s;elf, forming a canal lined by the membranes proceeding from the brain, which contains the &s;pinal marrow, and &s;erves to defend it from external injuries. The column of the &s;pine makes al&s;o a part of the cavity of the brea&s;t, bears up the ribs, &s;upports internally &s;everal organs e&s;|&s;ential to life, and connects the media&s;ti|num, that membrane, which divides the brea&s;t into two cavities, for the lodgment of the lungs. We readily conceive if this column &s;hould be thrown out of its natu|ral direction, it is impo&s;&s;ible, but that the marrow which it contains &s;hould &s;uffer in a greater or le&s;s degree. The nerves which
<PB N="4" REF="3">i&s;&s;ue from the di&s;tended or compre&s;&s;ed part, will act but imperfectly upon the parts to which they are di&s;tributed; from whence proceed that weakne&s;s and exte|nuation ob&s;ervable in the lower extremities of mo&s;t deformed per&s;ons; if the &s;pine is bent in &s;uch a manner as to take off from the cavity of the brea&s;t, the di&s;order be|come &s;till wor&s;e in its con&s;equences, for the lungs not finding room enough to ex|pand, cannot draw in a quantity of air &s;uf|ficient for each in&s;piration; &s;o that the ma&s;s of blood bereft of the advantages derived from a free and uninterrupted re&s;piration, becomes &s;o impoveri&s;hed, as hardly to &s;uf|fice for the &s;imple nouri&s;hment of the parts, much le&s;s, to contribute what is nece&s;&s;ary for their growth. The heart even is con|fined by the male conformation of the tho|rax, and is incapable of exerting its whole power in expelling the blood; the circula|tion therefore is more &s;lowly carried on, the &s;ecretions are imperfect, and all the vital functions become languid, not only the important organs of life within the brea&s;t are injured by this di&s;order, but its effects are &s;ometimes manife&s;ted al&s;o in the total de&s;truction of the animal oeconomy, and &s;ome of the able&s;t practitioners have traced
<PB N="5" REF="4">mo&s;t fatal accidents from this cau&s;e: often|times the pleura being &s;tretched or ob|&s;tructed, becomes inflamed, and forms prae|ternatural adhe&s;ions with the lungs, or el&s;e the ve&s;&s;els of that membrane being incapa|ble of ab&s;orbing the &s;uperfluous part of that fluid with which it is lubricated, a drop&s;y is formed, which is the more dan|gerous, as the cau&s;e which fir&s;t produced it, is continually increa&s;ing: at other times, the lungs become &s;chirrous, or ab|&s;cede; and an empyema en&s;ues, which is generally mortal. Doctor Gli&s;&s;on, in his treati&s;e on the rickets, declares, that, in the cour&s;e of his enquiries, with regard to the cau&s;es and effects of this di&s;order, he had often found appearances &s;imilar to tho&s;e abovementioned, in the brea&s;t of children who had died of the rickets: without paying any attention to the &s;tate of the bones which enter into the compo&s;ition of the brea&s;t, he a&s;cribes all tho&s;e effects to the immediate impre&s;&s;ion of a virus which he calls ricketty, upon the injured organs; but, &s;ince it is well known that the form of the brea&s;t is frequently much altered in ricketty per&s;ons, is it not more rea&s;onable to imagine, that the morbid appearances ob&s;erved by Gli&s;&s;on, were either owing to
<PB N="6" REF="5">the &s;tretching of the pleura, or the pre&s;|&s;ure upon the lungs, by the ribs, the &s;ter|num, or the vertebrae warped. This change in the make of the brea&s;t is not always productive of &s;uch fatal con&s;equences; it &s;hould &s;eem, as if the organs could &s;ome|times accommodate them&s;elves to confine|ment; when the alteration takes place very gradually; at other times, the new form which the brea&s;t acquires, pre&s;erves the &s;ame extent of cavity, as it would have had in the natural &s;tate; we need not therefore be &s;urprized, to &s;ee many people living for many years, with this infirmity; nor even, to find &s;ome among&s;t the number, who en|joy a tolerable &s;tate of health. But, we &s;hould be greatly mi&s;taken, if we were to infer from hence, that the curvature of the &s;pine is never the cau&s;e of death; on the contrary, however frequent the in&s;tances may be of per&s;ons living a length of time with this complaint, the number of tho&s;e who peri&s;h by it, is certainly more con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>This di&s;order may ari&s;e from various cau&s;es, among the mo&s;t frequent, we may reckon the neglect of tho&s;e, who have the care of children; either in dre&s;&s;ing them improperly, or &s;uffering them to throw
<PB N="7" REF="6">them&s;elves into, and habitually contract improper attitudes. A natural or acciden|tal weakne&s;s of the ligaments or mu&s;cles of the &s;pine, may al&s;o give ri&s;e to this di&s;|ea&s;e; as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take off from the &s;trength of the column, which will therefore give way, and bend under the weight of the head, and the upper extre|mities; a greater or le&s;s power of the mu&s;|cles on one &s;ide of the &s;pine, than on the other, may be reckoned as another cau&s;e of its deformity; but, it is mo&s;t generally owing to a ricketty habit of body.</P>
<P>Although mo&s;t authors concur in a&s;&s;ign|ing this di&s;po&s;ition as the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of the curvature of the &s;pine, yet they by no means agree about the manner in which it acts &s;o as to produce this effect; Gli&s;&s;on a&s;cribes it to an irregular di&s;tribu|tion of the nutritious juice in the bones; which being more liberally diffu&s;ed upon one &s;urface than another, will not allow them as they are growing, to pre&s;erve their natural form.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Petit, member of the aca|demy, in his excellent treati&s;e on the di&s;|ea&s;es of the bones, &s;ays after Mayow, that bones will not bend, unle&s;s they have been previou&s;ly &s;oftened by a vitiated &s;tate of
<PB N="8" REF="7">the juices, which &s;erve to nouri&s;h them; that, in that ca&s;e, the mu&s;cles and tendons being extenuated, and &s;hortned by the ricketty virus, pull the bones by their ela&s;|tic power more forcibly on one &s;ide, than on the other, &s;o that they are obliged to give way, as a bow does, when its &s;tring is &s;hortned.</P>
<P>However &s;pecious this explanation may appear, it is certainly difficult to deter|mine whether the bones are made crook|ed, becau&s;e they are drawn to one &s;ide, by the mu&s;cles being previou&s;ly &s;hortned, or, whether the mu&s;cles do not rather &s;horten them&s;elves, by their own power of contraction, after the bones have been once bent, and can no longer counterpoi&s;e that action, as they were u&s;ed to do: either of the&s;e &s;olutions appearing equally probable, there is certainly, independent of them, ano|ther more apparent cau&s;e of this di&s;order, which is, the weight of the head and the upper extremities, upon the &s;pine. This circum&s;tance has not e&s;caped Mr. Petit's ob&s;ervation, who takes notice of it as con|curring with the other cau&s;es. What has been &s;aid, relates only to children, or &s;uch as are young; but there are cau&s;es which may throw the &s;pine out of it's natural direction,
<PB N="9" REF="8">at all times of life; &s;uch as, any hard work, which keeps the body con&s;tantly bent, and habituates it little by little to re|main in that &s;tate; tho&s;e who carry heavy burdens on their head or &s;houlders, and tho&s;e who manure the ground, have com|monly the &s;pine bent forwards; as well as mo&s;t old hu&s;bandmen. Old age, which debilitates the action of the ligaments and mu&s;cles, frequently produces the &s;ame ef|fect, but in the&s;e in&s;tances the di&s;order is attended with few if any bad &s;ymptons; becau&s;e, the curvature is made very gra|dually, and that the extent of the thorax is not dimini&s;hed by it. There are even &s;ome per&s;ons in whom this crookedne&s;s throws the &s;ternum at a greater di&s;tance from the &s;pine; in the&s;e, the cavity acquires a greater extent, and a remarkable &s;trong voice, which they are often ob&s;erved to have, plainly indicates, that their lungs are not in the lea&s;t confined. I &s;hall not enter into a more explicit account of the cau&s;es and effects of this deformity; my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, being only to propo&s;e a new method, to prevent, or &s;et it to rights, when it will admit of a cure. The chief curative indi|cation is to re&s;i&s;t the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e in the beginning; and if the &s;pine is already
<PB N="10" REF="9">bent, to endeavour to make it &s;traight again, by a con&s;tant and gradual exten&s;ion. The means heretofore u&s;ed, to an&s;wer this pur|po&s;e, have been in&s;ufficient; the method which I propo&s;e will always &s;ucceed, when employed in proper ca&s;es, and put in prac|tice with nece&s;&s;ary precaution. To be con|vinced of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, we need only con&s;ider, that a &s;tick, however &s;lender it may be, can &s;upport a con&s;idera|ble weight, while it remains &s;traight and upright, but, if it happens to deviate in the lea&s;t from the &s;traight line, it &s;oon gives way entirely to the weight. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of the vertebral column; if by any accident it &s;hould be thrown out of it natural direction, the weight of the head and upper extremities, will not fail to increa&s;e the deviation; e&s;pecially in chil|dren, who&s;e bones have not yet acquired a nece&s;&s;ary firmne&s;s; and, in a &s;hort time dif|ferent &s;ymptoms &s;hew them&s;elves agreeably to the different way in which the &s;pine may be bent. It may perhaps be objected that although the &s;pine is naturally bent in &s;eve|ral places, yet it is not le&s;s capable of &s;up|porting the weight of the incumbent parts: but this will be readily an&s;wered if we con|&s;ider that nature, by giving the &s;pine the&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="10">various incurvations, has divided the pre&s;|&s;ure, and by this means guarded the co|lumn, again&s;t the effects which the weight of the parts, it is de&s;igned to &s;upport, might otherwi&s;e have produced, and, that the &s;pine reaps this advantage from the &s;i|tuation of tho&s;e organs, by which is is ena|bled to perform it's various motions: but, the po&s;ition of the mu&s;cles, which is only relative to the natural inflexions of the &s;pine, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of any &s;ervice when the bones are warped inwards, or to either &s;ide; to put a &s;top therefore, to the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the vertebrae &s;hould be brought back to their natural po&s;ition, and that they &s;hould be &s;o maintained, till &s;uch a time as the &s;pine has acquired a degree of firmne&s;s, &s;uf|ficient of it&s;elf, to counteract a power which is always attempting to bend it more and more.</P>
<P>It has always been thought nece&s;&s;ary to apply for help in the&s;e ca&s;es, and parents, alarmed merely by the idea of deformity which their children are threatned with, never fail to con&s;ult &s;ome per&s;on whom they can confide in; but, how manifold &s;oever may have been the means hitherto u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, they have been all contrived upon one and the &s;ame principle, which is,
<PB N="12" REF="11">a certain degree of pre&s;&s;ure upon the mo&s;t projecting part.</P>
<P>Sometimes, a bodice is u&s;ed, made firm with whalebone, and guarded in tho&s;e parts where it is intended to pre&s;s; &s;ometimes, it is a cro&s;s made of iron, and at other times in &s;hort, it is &s;ome kind of machine invented for compre&s;&s;ion: but, the &s;lighte&s;t reflection upon the &s;tructure of the parts, will readily account for the little &s;ucce&s;s all the&s;e trials have been attended with. What effect indeed can pre&s;&s;ure po&s;&s;ibly have in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the &s;pine is bent inwards or latterally; e&s;pecially, if the curvature is at the middle or lower part of the column? The compre&s;&s;ing machines have then no immediate bearing upon the &s;pine; they mu&s;t therefore act upon the ribs: but, the&s;e buttre&s;&s;es, who&s;e po&s;ition is oblique, will more readily give way according to the mo|tion of their articulation, than they will be able to force out the vertebrae; this pre&s;|&s;ure which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily therefore incom|mode of re&s;piration, lo&s;es al&s;o its effect on the &s;pine, more particularly on account of the circular form of the ribs, and their flexibility; &s;o that the proportion of force acting upon the vertebral column is reduced almo&s;t to nothing. The vertebrae of the loins when bent laterally or inwards, are
<PB N="13" REF="12">not more likely to be redre&s;&s;ed by any pre&s;|&s;ure of this kind, for the thickne&s;s of the mu&s;cles and integuments which cover this part, does not make a &s;ufficient re&s;i&s;tance, to communicate the effect which the com|pre&s;&s;ing body &s;hould have upon the verte|brae: to the&s;e impediments, we may add the weight of the head and upper extre|mities, which will always act upon the &s;pine, unle&s;s the patient is kept con&s;tantly in bed, which might be attended with many other inconveniences.</P>
<P>The only ca&s;e therefore, in which this pre&s;&s;ure could take any effect, would be, where the &s;pine was bent from within out|wards: for then by acting immediately up|on the vertebrae projecting, the progre&s;s of the di&s;order might perhaps be prevented; but the pain and con&s;traint which mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily follow &s;uch an operation would be almo&s;t in&s;upportable. The &s;pinal proce&s;&s;es of the vertebrae are &s;o projecting in the&s;e patients, that the &s;lighte&s;t degree of pre&s;|&s;ure cau&s;es great pain, and whatever care we may take in wadding and guarding both the compre&s;&s;ing bodies, and the parts which are to be compre&s;&s;ed, they are never able
<PB N="14" REF="13">to bear this pre&s;&s;ure for any length of time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may &s;ee a remarkable proof of this in the in&s;tance of Madame de Montomorency as related by Lazarus Riverius; from which ca&s;e it may be inferred, that the vio|lence of the torture cau&s;ed by the pre&s;&s;ure in the only ca&s;e where it could po&s;&s;ibly be of any &s;ervice, appears to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for rejecting it entirely.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Gli&s;&s;on being him&s;elf convinced of the in&s;ufficiency of all the&s;e methods, acknow|ledges the nece&s;&s;ity of extending the &s;pine in order to make it &s;traight again; but the &s;ort of exten&s;ion which he propo&s;es not be|ing con&s;tant, is &s;till inadequate: this me|thod, practi&s;ed in England, is called &s;wing|ing; it con&s;i&s;ts, in &s;u&s;pending the child with &s;trings di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that the body may be entirely &s;upported by the head and upper extremities; and to in|crea&s;e the degree of exten&s;ion, weights are &s;ometimes added to the feet. In this &s;itua|tion they endeavour to divert the child, that he may be induced to continue this ex|erci&s;e as long as po&s;&s;ible; but however delighted he may be at fir&s;t, at feeling him|&s;elf ballanced in the air, yet a wearine&s;s &s;oon &s;eizes all his limbs, and at the end of a quarter of an hour at mo&s;t, he begs to be relea&s;ed from his confinement. It is evident, that the effect of exten&s;ion for &s;o
<PB N="15" REF="14">&s;hort a time, mu&s;t be very trifling; and the weight of the parts during the re&s;t of the day, &s;oon de&s;troys any little advantage which may have been gained by it. If the &s;ame exerci&s;e is repeated, the alternate exten|&s;ion, and greater bearing down of the parts after the fatigue of it, weakens the mu&s;cles and ligaments &s;o much that the &s;pine becomes more pliant, and its curvature is increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it is evident, that nothing but a con&s;tant and gradual ex|ten&s;ion can po&s;&s;ibly prevent, or redre&s;s a praeternatural inflexion of the &s;pine; and that none of the methods hitherto practi&s;ed, are &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e. It remains there|fore that the method which I now offer to the public &s;hould be proved fully to an&s;wer this intention, and that it is con&s;equently far more beneficial than any yet propo&s;ed. The two mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances in this method are a whalebone bodice, and a ma|chine rather complicated in its &s;tructure, though extremely &s;imple in its effect.</P>
<P>The whalebone bodice differs from a common quilted wai&s;tcoat only, in being laced at the fore part, and being fitted clo&s;e to the hips and os &s;acrum.</P>
<P>The machine may be divided into three pieces. The fir&s;t, is a plate of bra&s;s having the form of a rectangle, a little blunted at
<PB N="16" REF="15">the angles, at each of which there is a per|foration made, to receive the flat heads of &s;ome &s;crews, after they have pa&s;&s;ed through corre&s;pondent holes made for that purpo&s;e, through the whole thickne&s;s of the bodice; this plate, by its con&s;truction, &s;erves to &s;up|port the beam or <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ory,</HI> which is the &s;econd piece; this beam is made of a piece of well tempered &s;teel, the body and foot of which are of equal thickne&s;s; it mu&s;t be two lines and an half in breadth; the foot and body of the beam mu&s;t be &s;traight, and continued, &s;o as to extend as far as the curvature in this &s;ame piece, which terminates at the fore part of the head. If the head is thrown &s;o much to one &s;ide, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o cau&s;e what is called the caput ob&s;tipum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he beam mu&s;t then be twi&s;ted, and its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pper branch bifurcated.</P>
<P>The third piece, or head dre&s;s, is the mo&s;t complicated part of the machine; it con&s;i&s;ts fir&s;t in a cap made of any kind of &s;oft cloth, the borders of which are to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our fingers broad, and to have two button <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oles made through them; &s;econdly, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">illet, made long enough to &s;urround the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead; thirdly, in a buckle, with a double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hape, each chape, furni&s;hed with two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ongues; the fourth part of the head dre&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a fillet of bra&s;s which becomes gradually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">in, it is bent towards it's flat &s;urface, and
<PB N="17" REF="16">is fitted to the double buckle. The fifth part is a &s;mall plate of bra&s;s or &s;teel made round, through a hole in the middle of which, pa&s;&s;es a pretty large hook, which is &s;ituated underneath this plate, in order to receive, or let through the end of the beam, which by &s;upporting the head and upper extremities, gradually lengthens the &s;pinal column, and pre&s;erves it in its natural and perpendicular direction. It may be imagined from the number of pieces which this machine is compo&s;ed of, that it's ap|plication is very difficult, but any per&s;on who has the care of a child, and who has ever &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of under&s;tanding may be taught in time to manage it with &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o other methods be&s;ides this Machine, for per&s;ons of a more advanced age in whom it is ineffectual, without the u&s;e of a &s;wing, in which I put them for &s;everal hours together. My &s;wing differs from GLISSON'S e&s;&s;entially, &s;ince it neither confines nor gives any pain to the patient. and that his limbs do not grow benumbed as they do with the other &s;wing commonly u&s;ed in this country; and which cannot be continued longer than a quarter of an hour at a time. I can even venture to &s;ay, that any per&s;on who will confine him&s;elf much
<PB N="18" REF="17">to his bed, may be cured in the &s;pace of three months.</P>
<P>The advantages of this machine are evi|dent; it keeps the &s;pine extended as much and for as long a time as one may think nece&s;&s;ary; the patient is able to walk with it, and can even employ him&s;elf as much as he plea&s;es. It does not hinder young ladies from playing on the harp&s;ichord, learning to dance, to draw, or to write. Children, who from the dangerous &s;tate of their health have been obliged to wear it all night long, have &s;till &s;lept as u&s;ual. I even &s;aw an in|&s;tance of a girl of eight years old at Paris, who finding her&s;elf relieved, fell &s;o fa&s;t a-&s;leep in her chair immediately after the machine had been put on, that her mother thought her dead, and told me the next day, that being at fir&s;t apprehen&s;ive that the ma|chine had killed her child, &s;he had a great mind to take the whole off.</P>
<P>This is not a matter of mere &s;peculation, for although the rea&s;ons here alledged, might be &s;ufficient to prove that this method is preferable to any other, yet the great &s;uc|ce&s;s which has attended the practice of it, in all the ca&s;es where it has been hitherto u&s;ed, will e&s;tabli&s;h this preference in a
<PB N="19" REF="18">more inconte&s;table manner; which I &s;hall endeavour to do by the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>In the month of September 1764, a lady twelve years old was &s;eized with a violent and con&s;tant cough, which could not be appea&s;ed; this was accompanied with a fe|ver which extenuated her to a terrible degree. The remedies which were admini&s;tered to her in a provincial convent, where &s;he was, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. Her parents had her brought back to Paris, where all the a&s;&s;i&s;tan|ces which medicine could furni&s;h were again tried with as little efficacy as before; and &s;he was thought to be in great danger of her life. I perceived, although I only &s;aw her in bed, that &s;he kept her&s;elf always bent; and that her face bore evident marks of a ricketty habit. I de&s;ired leave to look at the &s;pine, which I found very much warped laterally in two places, the five upper vertebrae of the back were thrown from the right to the left &s;ide and forwards; the three following vertebrae were in their natural direction, but were twi&s;ted &s;o that their bodies bearing to the left, dimini&s;hed con&s;iderably the right &s;ide of the thorax; the &s;our lower vertebrae of the back and the three upper vertebrae of the loins were incurvated from the left to the right &s;ide; &s;o that when &s;he was &s;itting, the whole body bore upon the right hip.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P>I told the parents that all the bad &s;ymp|toms which this child laboured under, were owing to a confinement of the organs within the brea&s;t; and that, in&s;tead of giving her medicines internally, the only way to effect a cure, was, to &s;et the &s;uffering parts at ea&s;e quickly. The little &s;ucce&s;s which was to be expected from the methods commonly u&s;ed, induced me to contrive a machine, nearly &s;imilar to the one above de&s;cribed. This machine although very rude at that time, and much le&s;s convenient than the one I u&s;e at pre&s;ent, had notwith&s;tanding &s;o good an effect, that in a &s;hort time, the &s;ymptoms which endangered life being re|moved, the lady recovered her u&s;ual full|ne&s;s and health. The curvature of the &s;pine has al&s;o di&s;appeared, and &s;he is at pre&s;ent very well &s;haped.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t trial of the machine; the &s;ucce&s;s attending it, and the frequent opportunities which have &s;ince offered of applying it, have induced me to endeavour to bring this method to a greater degree of perfection; and the cour&s;e of three years application to this circum&s;tance, has taught me the following particulars.</P>
<P>By this method therefore, we may expect to cure any children who&s;e &s;pine is crooked,
<PB N="21" REF="20">provided that their age does not exceed 12 or 13 years; and provided, we may depend upon the per&s;ons who have the care of them, &s;o far as to be a&s;&s;ured that they will oblige them to wear the machine con&s;tantly. The number of children who have been cured at this age is too con&s;iderable to give an ac|count of them here, it may be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that many cures of this kind have been performed, under the in&s;pection of &s;ome mem|bers of the academy: Mr. <HI>Louis,</HI> the perpetual &s;ecretary, has &s;een one in&s;tance in a little girl between 7 and 8 years of age: Mr. <HI>Andouill&egrave;</HI> fir&s;t &s;urgeon to the king in rever&s;ion, has &s;een, with Mr. <HI>Didier,</HI> a member of this academy, another young lady who has been &s;et to rights in a &s;hort &s;pace of time; &s;he was only &s;ix years old, and the curvature was not yet very con&s;iderable; the &s;ame Mr. <HI>Didier</HI> has &s;een other patients cured in the &s;ame manner. A young lady of nine years old has been cured under the in&s;pection of Mr. <HI>De la Malle,</HI> coun&s;ellor of the academy; and the cure of another of eight years old has been &s;een by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ruffell,</HI> director of the academy. When a more advanced age fru&s;trates the hopes of an entire cure, on account of the &s;pine not having a &s;ufficient degree of flexibility to give way to the force
<PB N="22" REF="21">of the machine, it may then be applied with intention to put a &s;top to the farther progre&s;s of the di&s;order, and it &s;hould be wore in &s;uch circum&s;tances till age has &s;o far &s;trengthened the &s;pine, that all danger is removed, Mr. <HI>Hou&s;tet,</HI> antient director of the academy, entru&s;ted to my care a lady of 14 years old, who&s;e &s;hape was deformed; this lady has not been quite cured though &s;he wore the machine for one year and an half; but the inconvenience, far from in|crea&s;ing as it would have done done without this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, has been much le&s;&s;ened, &s;o that there is now no appearance of any de|formity when the lady is dre&s;t.&mdash;When the crookedne&s;s of the &s;pine has begun very early in life, and has gained very con&s;idera|bly, we cannot a&s;certain the cure, but &s;till the ca&s;e is not to be given up as irreme|diable; e&s;pecially, if there is no di&s;tortion of the vertebrae: Mr. <HI>Duclos,</HI> member of the academy, &s;ent me in the year 1765, a little boy, aged 9 years, who&s;e &s;pine was &s;o very crooked, that his chin was &s;upported by his brea&s;t; and the &s;ternum made a very great projection forwards; the lower ex|tremity on the left &s;ide being weaker than on the right, had given way to the weight of the body, and was con&s;iderably bent in|wards at the articulation of the thigh bone
<PB N="23" REF="22">with the tibia: the child could &s;carcely &s;upport him&s;elf; he could not &s;leep, and, cried out &s;o much in the night time, that his parents were afraid he &s;hould die. When the child had wore the machine for a fort|night, he began to grow better in his health, his &s;leep and appetite returned, and he &s;oon after recovered, and became plump as u&s;ual; his &s;hape now deviates very little from the natural &s;tate, and what is &s;till more remark|ble, his limb recovered it&s;elf &s;o far without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that there now remains but a very &s;light bend, which will probably wear off in time. The di&s;tortion of the vertebrae re&s;i&s;ts the power of the machine more than other circum&s;tances; on which ac|count, we &s;hould take care not to make an incon&s;iderate progno&s;tic. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where the age of the patient, or the advanced &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, will not permit us to expect a compleat cure, the machine will always be of &s;o much &s;ervice, as to re&s;tore health. Two ladies who were each of them between 14 and 15 years age, were reduced to &s;uch a degree of Mara&s;mus, that it was concluded they had but a &s;hort time to live; the &s;pine was &s;o crooked that the natural length of their &s;hape was dimini&s;hed by one half at lea&s;t; the brea&s;t had almo&s;t lo&s;t all marks of its fir&s;t appearance, and conformation;
<PB N="24" REF="23">their breathing was &s;hort, their power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dige&s;tion was de&s;troyed, and they &s;uffered continual pains all over the body; &s;o that the&s;e children could &s;carcely be &s;aid to live, but rather &s;eemed to be going &s;lowly and gradually down to the grave. The u&s;e of the machine has re&s;tored health to each of them; they have recovered their fullne&s;s, one of them is even grown fat; they can both go up the &s;teepe&s;t &s;tair-ca&s;e without be|ing out of breath; which they could not have done before without infinite trouble and op|pre&s;&s;ion; their &s;hapes are not entirely rectified, the little deformity remaining, can ea&s;ily be hid by their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Such are the &s;imple means, to which many per&s;ons owe the recovery of their health, and the beauty of their &s;hapes. My wi&s;hes would be fulfilled, if by adopt|ing this invention, practitioners &s;hould con|firm the po&s;&s;ibility of curing a di&s;order, the mo&s;t moderate effect of which, is, to occa|&s;ion a deformity which la&s;ts as long as life.</P>
