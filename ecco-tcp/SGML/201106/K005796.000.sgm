<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON returning lately from a long journey, I found on my table various communications from the College of Sur|geons, re&s;pecting the Chirurgical Department of the Royal Infirmary, a &s;ubject highly intere&s;ting to the College, to the Ho&s;pital, and to the Public, in &s;o far as, whatever relates to the &s;tudy and practice of Surgery in this place, will, in a con|&s;iderable degree, be found to depend on it.</P>
<P>The&s;e communications were accompanied with a reque&s;t, that any plan which I wi&s;hed to &s;ugge&s;t for regulating the attendance of Surgeons on the Infirmary, might be delivered by the 27th of la&s;t month:&mdash;This it was not in my power to accompli&s;h; but I may not yet be too late in communicating my opinion; and in doing &s;o in a matter which involves &s;uch variety of intere&s;t, I judge it right to &s;tate &s;ome of the rea&s;ons on which it is founded.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>In thus addre&s;&s;ing a letter to the Members of the College of Surgeons, I have not the vanity to think, that I &s;hall have much influence on their deci&s;ions; but in a matter of &s;uch im|portance as this undoubtedly is, I con&s;ider it as a duty incum|bent on every individual of our number, to let his opinion be clearly &s;tated: &s;o that the &s;ubject may be fully con&s;idered, and in every variety of view, before the College, as a public body, &s;hall take an important &s;tep which cannot be recalled, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e if it ever &s;hall collectively adopt and de|clare, any opinion or re&s;olution, on a que&s;tion &s;o nearly con|nected with the intere&s;t of the public.</P>
<P>In regard to the legal right of the College of Surgeons to attend the Infirmary in rotation, the con&s;equence of an agree|ment entered into, upwards of &s;ixty years ago, between the Members of the College at that time, and the Managers of the Infirmary; as very oppo&s;ite opinions have been given of it by good lawyers, it would be pre&s;umption in others, not ver|&s;ant in the law, to judge of it. But with this difference of opinion among the coun&s;el who have been con&s;ulted, on the only point upon which the claim of the College of Surgeons re&s;ts; with much uncertainty, therefore, of &s;ucce&s;s, were it to become a que&s;tion at law; we are all entitled to judge of any mea&s;ure that &s;hall pledge the funds of the College, or rather the property of our poor, on the event of an expen&s;ive&mdash;doubt|ful litigation, which might not be brought to a conclu&s;ion du|ring the exi&s;tence of any of our pre&s;ent number.</P>
<P>Even in this view of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and thinking, as I do, that the tran&s;action on which the claim of the College of Surgeons re&s;ts, was unguardedly entered into on the part of tho&s;e Managers of the Infirmary by whom it was conducted, who in this matter appear to have done what their charter does not warrant, I am clearly of opinion, if the Managers
<PB N="5" REF="4">are now re&s;olved on making it a que&s;tion, as &s;eems to be their intention, that the College ought to depart from it.</P>
<P>But were the legal rights of the College on this point even e&s;tabli&s;hed, I would &s;ay, as on all occa&s;ions I have done, that we ought freely, and of our own accord, to relieve the Mana|gers of the Infirmary, from the effect of a tran&s;action which ought never, in my opinion, to have taken place; which I have always con&s;idered as prejudicial to the Infirmary, with|out an&s;wering any good purpo&s;e to us; whil&s;t it did not tend to afford &s;uch advantages to the pupils who daily re&s;ort to the Infirmary for improvement, as there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e they might have reaped from the practice being conducted by a limited number of Surgeons, &s;elected for the purpo&s;e, and pla|ced on a fixed e&s;tabli&s;hment; in&s;tead of being under the di|rection of any &s;et of practitioners changed in rotation every two or three months, or on any &s;y&s;tem of rotation that can be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, the College of Surgeons, have, in every re|&s;pect, acted as well as the &s;ame number of practitioners, un|der &s;imilar circum&s;tances, any where could have done; and I doubt not of the Managers of the Infirmary being clearly of this opinion: But I al&s;o believe, that the bu&s;ine&s;s would have been conducted with more accuracy and care, if it had been left entirely to a few: If, however, the majority of our num|ber are not of this opinion, the mea&s;ure to which I allude, that of our departing voluntarily from the right which hi|therto we have claimed, to attend the Infirmary in rotation, will nece&s;&s;arily be rejected; which mo&s;t &s;incerely I &s;hall de|plore, as to me it appears, that in adopting the conduct which I have propo&s;ed, the College would act more con&s;i&s;tently with its character as a public body, and, on the whole, that more &s;atisfaction would re&s;ult from it, than is ever likely to be the ca&s;e, from their entering on a tedious law&s;uit with the Ma|nagers
<PB N="6" REF="5">of a public charity; in defence of their own rights; on a point in which the public are materially intere&s;ted; which they will not therefore regard with indifference; and which, after many years of litigation, might probably be decided again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Before the College &s;hall re&s;olve on a point of &s;uch import|ance, attended, as it probably would be, with con&s;equences which all of us might regret, they ought to con&s;ider, that the Managers of the Infirmary, were they even ultimately to lo&s;e the que&s;tion in a court of law, might &s;till defeat entirely the views of tho&s;e who wi&s;h for frequent changes in our attend|ance, and yet adhere to the very words of their agreement with the College of Surgeons; by allowing them to attend in rotation, but in&s;tead of a change at the end of every two or three months, that it &s;hould only take place every twelfth or fifteenth year, as at one period they meant to have done.</P>
<P>From every view, therefore, that can be taken of the que&s;|tion; the uncertainty of our prevailing in a trial at law; the important lo&s;s which the expence of a tedious law&s;uit would occa&s;ion to our poor, who are ill able to bear it; the power which the Managers of the Infirmary po&s;&s;e&s;s, whatever the event of the litigation may be, of di&s;appointing tho&s;e who wi&s;h for frequent changes; and the &s;atisfaction that we all would derive, from the Chirurgical Department of the Infir|mary being put under the direction of &s;uch a &s;mall proportion of our number, as would tend to improve all that relates to it; I am, from all the&s;e con&s;iderations, induced to hope, that the College will re&s;olve on re&s;igning voluntarily all tho&s;e rights in this matter, to the Managers of the Infirmary, which hi|therto we have claimed; in&s;i&s;ting on no conditional attend|ance, and on no other terms but a re&s;titution of that &s;um which the College originally gave to the Infirmary, on the
<PB N="7" REF="6">agreement fir&s;t taking place, and to which the Managers will not probably di&s;pute their claim.</P>
<P>While, by this liberal conduct, the College would be entit|led to the warme&s;t thanks of the public, and of all who are able to judge of its importance, they will al&s;o derive &s;atisfac|tion from a ready compliance with the reque&s;t of the Mana|gers of the Infirmary, in &s;ugge&s;ting that plan for their con&s;i|deration, which, in this intere&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hall to a majori|ty of our number, appear to be the be&s;t.</P>
<P>On a point of &s;uch general intere&s;t, &s;ubmitted to the con&s;i|deration of a large Society, much variety of opinion mu&s;t pre|vail, and many &s;chemes be propo&s;ed; but it will be the duty of the College to decide on that plan, which they wi&s;h to re|commend to the Managers, who will carry it into effect, ei|ther in the form in which they &s;hall receive it, or under &s;uch modifications as to them it &s;hall appear to require. It may likewi&s;e be &s;ufficiently proper for the College to tran&s;mit to the Managers of the Infirmary all tho&s;e plans of attendance, whether printed or in manu&s;cript, which individuals of our number may incline to &s;ugge&s;t; as I &s;hall take the charge of doing with this.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed this explanation of my opinion, and think|ing it probable that the Managers of the Infirmary may not yet be determined whether the Surgeons &s;hould be put on a permanent appointment or not; but of which they will not probably remain long in doubt; the following articles of a plan for a limited cour&s;e of attendance, liable to &s;uch altera|tions as the College &s;hall wi&s;h to propo&s;e, is in the mean time offered to their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ON all the Members now on the li&s;t of the College of Sur|geons having attended in the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of rotation, but not till then, Four &s;enior and Two junior Surgeons &s;hall be
<PB N="8" REF="7">elected by the Managers, and to their charge the whole Chi|rurgical E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Infirmary &s;hall be intru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The two elde&s;t of this nomination to attend daily when not prevented by di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e of ab&s;ence, for the &s;pace of &s;even, eight, or ten years, as may be agreed on,&mdash;the longer, in my opinion, the better; each to have the charge of one &s;ide of every ward, in the &s;ame manner as has long been the ca&s;e with the Phy&s;icians, and to perform all the operations on his own patients, which during that period &s;hall occur.</P>
<P>In ab&s;ence of either or both of the acting Surgeons, the bu&s;ine&s;s to be done by one or both of the two other &s;enior Surgeons; and in the event of their being al&s;o ab&s;ent, by the fir&s;t junior Surgeon who can be got.</P>
<P>No operation of importance to be performed, but with the &s;anction of a con&s;ultation, at which all the &s;ix Surgeons may attend, but which nece&s;&s;arily &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of three, the acting Surgeons for the time always con&s;tituting two; if it be not in accidents requiring immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and when the &s;enior Surgeons cannot be got.</P>
<P>One of the junior Surgeons to attend daily at the u&s;ual hour of receiving patients, by which a &s;ufficient number for con|&s;ultation will always be at hand; and to his care all di&s;&s;ec|tions to be intru&s;ted. This attendance of the junior Surgeons to be regulated by their own convenience, either on changes of two, three, or &s;ix months.</P>
<P>At the end of the period to which their appointment &s;hall extend, the two acting Surgeons &s;hall re&s;ign their places to the other two &s;enior Surgeons, who being &s;ucceeded by the two junior or a&s;&s;i&s;tant Surgeons, two juniors mu&s;t be elected by the Managers: And thus, with an election, every &s;even, eight, or ten years, as the Managers &s;hall prefer, of Two ju|nior Surgeons, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s will be conducted: it be|ing
<PB N="9" REF="8">under&s;tood, that every vacancy ari&s;ing from death or re|&s;ignation, or any other cau&s;e, &s;hall be immediately occupied, by the Surgeon, who, in &s;eniority, is next to him who previ|ou&s;ly held the place; and in no in&s;tance, that a newly elected Surgeon &s;hall be preferred.</P>
<P>THE advantages of this &s;cheme are, that while it avoids all the inconveniences which re&s;ult from frequent changes of practitioners, no Surgeon, after tho&s;e who are fir&s;t ap|pointed, will ever have charge of any important part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, till, by attending for a con&s;iderable time as a&s;&s;i&s;tant, he has acquired experience; nor will any practitioner be allowed to occupy the appointment till he is too much ad|vanced in years.</P>
<P>It al&s;o would &s;ecure a regular con&s;ultation daily, with lit|tle trouble to the practitioners,&mdash;an object of much import|ance in every plan that can be propo&s;ed, and from which, much advantage would accrue to the Infirmary: for by this arrangement, every patient would receive an immediate opi|nion, and would not be admitted in the view of a future con|&s;ultation, as on the pre&s;ent plan of attendance is frequently found to happen, with ca&s;es for which nothing can be done, and by which patients are often kept in the Ho&s;pital, with much inconvenience to them&s;elves, and lo&s;s to the funds of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>On this plan, all the inconveniences ari&s;ing from con&s;ulta|tions being too numerous, would likewi&s;e be avoided. It might indeed be an improvement of this, and of every plan that can be propo&s;ed, to have the number on con&s;ultations limited to a very few; probably to three: for while all the advanta|ges of con&s;ultation are obtained from a &s;mall number, as very univer&s;ally is allowed to be the ca&s;e in private practice, it would in the &s;ure&s;t manner tend to obviate tho&s;e objections to which large con&s;ultations are almo&s;t in all circum&s;tances
<PB N="10" REF="9">found to be liable; which commonly are &s;o great, that few Surgeons of experience, and in full employment, would enter on any charge in which they &s;hould be obliged to &s;ubmit to them.</P>
<P>The chief deficiency indeed of the plan which I thus &s;ugge&s;t for your con&s;ideration, and for that of the Managers of the Infirmary, is, that it does not &s;ecure to the Infirmary, &s;o long as in various circum&s;tances might be de&s;irable, the exertion of tho&s;e Surgeons, who, from their abilities, expe|rience, and reputation, the Managers might &s;till wi&s;h to re|tain: and this I mu&s;t acknowledge is a very important ob|jection to every &s;cheme in which it occurs: for all mankind, and patients in Ho&s;pitals among others, are abundantly &s;en|&s;ible of the various advantages which in every branch of the medical pre&s;e&s;&s;ion are derived from experience, when conjoined with &s;ufficient abilities, humanity and attention; without which indeed it &s;ignifies nothing.</P>
<P>In every &s;imilar in&s;titution of importance of which we have any account, whether in England or other parts, &s;uch value is placed on the advantages which experience affords, that the Surgeons in almo&s;t the whole of them are now put on a permanent footing; and for this very obvious rea&s;on, that no Surgeon with a ri&s;ing reputation, &s;uch as the Mana|gers of any public in&s;titution would wi&s;h their practitioners to po&s;&s;e&s;s, would conceive it to be either for his credit or in|tere&s;t, to accept of the appointment under any other con|dition; and we all know how feeble tho&s;e exertions common|ly are, where the credit and intere&s;t of tho&s;e by whom they are made, do not in a con&s;iderable degree depend on them: and in judging from matter of fact, the progre&s;s which the art of &s;urgery makes where the&s;e permanent appointments have taken place, is &s;o evident and great, that we cannot doubt of their utility.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P>Before we attempt, therefore, to oppo&s;e what in a matter of this importance other large communities have done, who, with equal opportunities of judging, and the &s;ame capability of doing &s;o, have uniformly departed from the limited appoint|ment of Surgeons to Ho&s;pitals, and put them on a fixed e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons &s;hould be &s;et forth for it; which, &s;o far as I know, has neither been done nor at|tempted.</P>
<P>Of the few objections which have been made to Surgeous of large Ho&s;pitals being permanently fixed, the fo&s;lowing only &s;eem to require notice: That they mu&s;t be apt to become indolent, to neglect their duty, and, on the approach of old age, to do harm to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of which they have the charge, by continuing to operate after being unfit for it; and as the&s;e opinions have made an impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome part of our number, and perhaps al&s;o on the Managers of the In&s;ir|mary, who may not therefore as yet be induced either to alter the mode of our attendance &s;o completely as to render it permanent, or to reduce the number of Surgeons &s;o much as in my opinion ought to be done; in offering the foregoing plan for their con&s;ideration, I have endeavoured to make it retain in a con&s;iderable degree the chief advantages of a permanent appointment, with a moderate number of practi|tioners, without &s;tretching the principles on which it is found|ed too far.</P>
<P>I am not, however, of opinion, that this, or any other li|mited attendance of Surgeons, will ever prove &s;o u&s;eful to the Infirmary, or the City of Edinburgh, as permanent ap|pointments in other places have done; chiefly for this rea|&s;on, that no practitioners can be &s;uppo&s;ed to enter with much zeal on this or any other appointment, which they know will terminate in a few years, and from which, after having &s;pent tho&s;e years, often the mo&s;t valuable of their lives, in the charge of, they mu&s;t be turned off, never to be connected
<PB N="12" REF="11">with it again: and if the zeal of tho&s;e to whom the care of any department is committed be not fully excited and encouraged, tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with human na|ture will admit, that every branch of it will be in the ri&s;k of being carried on with languor, and of &s;uffering from want of exertion.</P>
<P>This opinion of the permanent appointment of Surgeons to large Ho&s;pitals, being apt to le&s;&s;en their a&s;&s;iduity, and in other circum&s;tances al&s;o to do harm, in a great degree ap|pears to be &s;peculative, and not &s;upported by experience of the effects of it: for wherever appointments of this kind have taken place, the &s;tate of &s;urgery has been greatly im|proved, while in tho&s;e Ho&s;pitals which long ago have car|ried the mea&s;ure into effect, we are not accu&s;tomed to per|ceive that any part of the bu&s;ine&s;s is more liable to fall into neglect than it is in others; or, in ours, where the &s;y&s;tem of attending in rotation has been at its height, and of long du|ration, that it has met with more attention than that which Surgeons on permanent appointments commonly give to it: both plans may occa&s;ionally be ill conducted, and every mode of attendance that can be propo&s;ed may be produc|tive of much harm if any important duties are omitted, which tho&s;e in the charge of them &s;hould perform; but without full evidence of the fact, we are not entitled to &s;ay, that the plans of attendance which other Ho&s;pitals have adopted, and continue to prefer, are wor&s;e, and liable to great|er difficulties, than our own.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have been induced to &s;upport a different opi|nion, &s;hould recollect, that the bad effects which they &s;eem to dread from permanent appointments in Ho&s;pitals, are powerfully counteracted by many cau&s;es: the credit of the practitioners with the public; their real intere&s;t; and that laudable pride which we are bound to believe that every man mu&s;t feel in the hone&s;t di&s;charge of his duty, whom the Ma|nagers of a public charity could be &s;uppo&s;ed to elect; are all
<PB N="13" REF="12">&s;trong pledges for its being done: be&s;ides which, the conduct of practitioners in this &s;ituation, being at all times under the direct ob&s;ervation of the Managers by whom they were e|lected, and by whom they can be turned off; before we ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert that improprieties from this cau&s;e take place in other Ho&s;pitals, or that they are either likely to happen, or to be long permitted to exi&s;t in ours, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, what we are not entitled to do, that the Managers of our public charities act their parts with gro&s;s mi&s;conduct indeed; as would &s;urely be the ca&s;e, were they, for any length of time, to allow the bu&s;ine&s;s of any department, whether that of the Surgeons, or any other under their charge, to be either ne|glected or improperly performed.</P>
<P>The inconveniences which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;t re&s;ult from Surgeons with fixed appointments in Ho&s;pitals, being apt to continue in the di&s;charge of their duty till too late a period, mu&s;t be equally liable to happen on every plan of at|tendance in which no re&s;triction from age has taken place, as hitherto has been the ca&s;e in ours: but in almo&s;t every Ho&s;pi|tal in which fixed appointments have occurred, the&s;e incon|veniences are guarded again&s;t, by a young practitioner be|ing elected as a&s;&s;i&s;tant to every &s;enior Surgeon, who takes charge of all &s;uch parts of the duty as the other may not be able to perform, and who, from being long trained to the bu|&s;ine&s;s, is commonly fit for every part of it when it devolves on him at la&s;t.</P>
<P>In this manner, and with no expence being incurred by it, for &s;alaries are &s;eldom given to a&s;&s;i&s;tants, all the benefit is re|tained which the experience and ob&s;ervation of &s;enior prac|titioners afford; while, from their being permitted to attend as long as they incline, every appearance of that &s;everity is removed, to which all men mu&s;t feel that they are expo&s;ed, on being forced to retire from a department of which they have for a con&s;iderable time had the &s;ole charge, and which they are &s;till both able and willing to continue; a degree of
<PB N="14" REF="13">&s;everity, I may &s;afely venture to a&s;&s;ert, to which no &s;et of men, intru&s;ted with bu&s;ine&s;s of this importance, will in any other &s;ituation be found to be liable.</P>
<P>But while, in the management of other Ho&s;pitals, it has been an object from which they never wi&s;h to depart, to re|tain the Surgeons whom they employ as long as they incline to continue, and thus to obtain the advantages which long experience gives; in &s;aying to the Managers of the Royal In|firmary, as many at this time have done, that they &s;hould li|mit the attendance of their practitioners to a few months, or at mo&s;t to a few years, we de&s;ire them to do the very rever&s;e, and only to permit the Surgeons to attend till in &s;ome degree they &s;hall have acquired experience; then to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for ever, and their places to be &s;upplied by young men: thus tending to produce and to perpetuate a wor&s;e &s;y&s;tem, by a great deal, than that which they wi&s;h to be removed; for while many inconveniences re&s;ult from attendance in rota|tion, it does not prevent any of our number from attending, and giving their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Before adopting this opinion, the Managers of the Infir|mary will do well to advert to this and other bad con&s;equen|ces that may re&s;ult from the Surgeons being placed on &s;hort appointments; and if they are not yet convinced of the propriety of putting them on a permanent footing, they will not readily doubt of protracting their attendance to a pe|riod of many years.</P>
<P>Were this even to be done, the Managers will not proba|bly come under any agreement for the &s;ame plan being con|tinued; for, however favourably &s;ome part of their number may at pre&s;ent think of a limited attendance for the Sur|geons, there is much rea&s;on to believe, that, in the cour&s;e of a &s;hort time, they will wi&s;h to place them on permanent appointments. They will al&s;o, in the con&s;ideration of this
<PB N="15" REF="14">point, advert to the difficulty of changing any plan when it has been once acted upon; that half mea&s;ures &s;eldom an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they are meant; and while they never completely &s;atisfy any of the parties concerned in them, they are commonly more difficult to carry into effect, than others that would more fully an&s;wer the purpo&s;e from the fir&s;t, and which of nece&s;&s;ity are commonly adopted at la&s;t.</P>
<P>In the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion, it has been alleged, that a frequent &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Surgeons, whether for two months at once, as hitherto has been the ca&s;e in the Infir|mary, or for &s;ix months; or, as &s;ome have propo&s;ed, for two or three years; would be productive of much advantage to the public, which never could ari&s;e from their being put on a permanent footing; by affording, as they conceive that li|mited appointments would do, to a con&s;iderable number of Surgeons, opportunities for acquiring experience, and thus rendering them more able to di&s;charge their duty in private practice than otherwi&s;e could be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But it ought to be noticed, that the whole import of this argument implies, that we are to acquire experience, by means which the Managers of the Infirmary are not likely to admit, and &s;hould not therefore be &s;tated as a motive for the Surgeons being put on &s;hort appointments; for the mean|ing of it certainly is, that from the period of our becoming Members of the College of Surgeons, we &s;hould all be entitled to attend on frequent changes, and to acquire knowledge and dexterity in operations, by practi&s;ing on the patients of the Infirmary. But while it may be greatly for the intere&s;t of the patients that a few Surgeons &s;hould be allowed to derive this advantage from their attendance, with the view of their be|ing retained on permanent appointments, the Managers will not readily be induced to think, that the &s;ame privilege &s;hould be given to others, or to more than the &s;urgical department
<PB N="16" REF="15">of the Ho&s;pital requires; and if this con&s;ideration &s;hall be allowed to have weight, it will be equally obvious, that the utility of any plan of attendance which they may adopt, mu&s;t in a con&s;iderable degree depend on the period to which it is made to extend; &s;o that, in&s;tead of appointments of this kind being made of &s;hort duration, few will doubt of the propriety of their being protracted to a great length.</P>
<P>Even on the plan which I have propo&s;ed, were the acting Surgeons to continue in employment only for &s;even years, as the a&s;&s;i&s;tants would always be young men, almo&s;t every Sur|geon would be &s;et a&s;ide by the age of forty-five; often &s;ome years &s;ooner: whil&s;t, by every other plan which the College has received at this time, all of which limit the attendance of the acting Surgeons to three years, their connection with the Ho&s;pital would very commonly end at more ear|ly periods, &s;omewhere from the thirtieth to their thirty-fifth year; an age, at which it would undoubtedly be more for the intere&s;t of the Ho&s;pital that they &s;hould be retain|ed, than to have the bu&s;ine&s;s again put under the charge of a younger cla&s;s of practitioners.&mdash;The objections in|deed to which all of the&s;e plans are on this con&s;ideration liable, appear to me &s;o very important, that I am induced to believe that they have not been in the view of tho&s;e Gentle|men by whom they were propo&s;ed; for they amount preci&s;e|ly, as I have already ob&s;erved, to this, that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Surgery in the Infirmary &s;hould at all times be in the hands of young men, and every practitioner be obliged to re|tire, never to appear in it again, at the very be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;e|ful period of his life; con&s;equences, which they could not po&s;&s;ibly mean to re&s;ult from them, and to which it is not probable that the Managers will ever oblige the patients of the Infirmary to &s;ubmit.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<P>But whatever the views of the Managers on this important part of the que&s;tion &s;hall be, it may ea&s;ily I think be &s;hown, that while much harm would re&s;ult to the Public from the Surgeons of the Infirmary being put on &s;hort appointments, that no benefit could ari&s;e from it to the College of Sur|geons.</P>
<P>By the whole chirurgical department of the Infirmary be|ing given on a permanent appointment to two acting Sur|geons, with two junior Surgeons as their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, a number perfectly &s;ufficient for every part of it, there is &s;urely much rea&s;on to believe that the bu&s;ine&s;s would be done with more accuracy and attention than it is ever likely to be if the num|ber to whom it is given &s;hall be large; and while the prac|tice which they would thus po&s;&s;e&s;s in operations might be &s;uf|ficient for adding greatly to the in&s;truction of this limited number, and might thus render them expert Surgeons, yet all who advert to the &s;mall number of operations which Ho&s;pitals not larger than the Royal Infirmary can afford, will admit, that if the&s;e operations were divided among many practition|ers, liable to frequent changes, their effects would be in a great mea&s;ure, if not entirely, lo&s;t; and, therefore, that the Public, as well as the Infirmary, would &s;uffer in a very e&s;&s;en|tial manner, were this ever to happen; while no benefit could accrue from it to us.</P>
<P>At all times, it has been my opinion, that, in this view, the permanent appointment of a few Surgeons to the In|firmary, would prove highly u&s;eful to the City of Edin|burgh, which in this manner would be &s;upplied with a &s;uffi|cient number of Surgeons, in the frequent practice of opera|tions, by which alone due perfection in the art of performing them can either be acquired or pre&s;erved; a po&s;ition which none will doubt who are able to judge of it.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<P>Of the very important advantages which Surgeons derive from frequent employment in operations, the public indeed are &s;ufficiently aware; and, &s;o far as it has been in their power, they have long done preci&s;ely what the Managers of the In|firmary ought long ago to have done, by employing a few practitioners only as Surgeons: for all of us know, and the public knows well, that in &s;pite of the influence which the frequent attendance of every member of the College of Sur|geons in the Royal Infirmary might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have, and as &s;ome have alleged that it nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t have in this mat|ter, &s;till a large proportion of all chirurgical operations per|formed in Edinburgh, are done by a very &s;mall part of our number.</P>
<P>Nor is this &s;tate of our &s;urgery peculiar to the pre&s;ent times; for it always has been the ca&s;e, and as long as the pu|blic are able to judge between right and wrong, which in all that relates to their own &s;afety and advantage they are abun|dantly capable of doing, it will &s;till continue to be &s;o: that is, till the Managers of the Infirmary &s;hall re&s;olve on doing what their predece&s;&s;ors ought to have done, and &s;hall appoint a few Surgeons to the permanent charge of the &s;urgery of the Infirmary, to the number perhaps of four, the public will give a large &s;hare of their employment in operations, even to a le&s;s number than this, by chiefly re&s;orting, as hitherto they have commonly done, to one or two.</P>
<P>A very few Surgeons I believe to be perfectly &s;ufficient for all the real practice in &s;urgery that Edinburgh is ever likely to afford; and for the rea&s;ons that I have given, I al&s;o be|lieve, that a very con&s;iderable part of it will continue to be done by one or two, till the event to which I allude &s;hall take place,&mdash;the appointment of the number that I have mentioned to the &s;urgical department of the Infirmary. If this num|ber of Surgeons &s;hall be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this department,
<PB N="19" REF="18">all of them would be heard of as operators, and each would receive that &s;hare of employment from the public, to which, from the general e&s;timation in which he might be held, he &s;hould be entitled.</P>
<P>But if many Surgeons &s;hould be appointed to this charge in the Infirmary, while no benefit would re&s;ult from it to the in&s;titution, the public, for the rea&s;ons I have endeavoured to enforce, would &s;till continue to give nearly the whole of their employment to a very few.</P>
<P>Hence, if the views which I have given in this que&s;tion are well founded, and they chiefly re&s;t on facts which few will readily di&s;pute, while very important advantages would re|&s;ult to the Infirmary and to the public from their being carried into effect, by putting the &s;urgery of that in&s;titution under the charge of a few, on appointments of long dura|tion; it does not appear, that any detriment would re&s;ult from it to the re&s;t of our number, who &s;till would continue in the very &s;ame employment, which they would otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s; which would neither be le&s;&s;ened or extended by this mea|&s;ure; and without performing one operation more or le&s;s than they do at pre&s;ent, or of incurring the ri&s;k, either of their emoluments, or importance in &s;ociety, being dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Nay, the arrangement to which I allude would &s;oon in a high degree prove &s;atisfactory to the whole of our number; for being frequently obliged by our patients, and we our&s;elves, in various in&s;tances, al&s;o wi&s;hing, to apply for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice of tho&s;e who are more in the habit of performing operations, it would very commonly be agreeable, and often u&s;eful, rather to have three or four to make choice of, than be under the nece&s;&s;ity, as hitherto has very commonly been the ca&s;e, of re&s;orting to one or two.</P>
<P>But there is &s;till another very important benefit that would re&s;ult from this arrangement, which I have always earne&s;tly
<PB N="20" REF="19">wi&s;hed were the ca&s;e, which, at no di&s;tant period, it will pro|bably be, and which the Managers of the Infirmary have at this moment greatly in their power to promote, I mean the total &s;eparation in this place, as already has happened in al|mo&s;t every large city but our own, of the operative part of &s;urgery from other branches of the profe&s;&s;ion. Whenever this &s;hall be done, and not till then, &s;urgery will be put on that foundation on which alone it &s;hould re&s;t. Other parts of the practice will then be conducted by one part of our number; and tho&s;e by whom the nice and important operations of &s;ur|gery are performed, being relieved from the practice of every other branch of medicine, would, with more certainty be enabled to di&s;charge their duty properly, and to &s;tudy with due accuracy and attention, tho&s;e improvements which their profe&s;&s;ion might require, than otherwi&s;e can be in their power.</P>
<P>Whatever the re&s;olution of the Managers of the Infirmary on this important point may be, no difference will ari&s;e from it to the &s;enior part of our Members, all of whom will continue to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame practice which hitherto they have done, without being affected by any change that can be made in the chirurgical department of the Infirmary: but this would not be the ca&s;e with the younger part of our number; for &s;uch of them as may re&s;olve on confining their views to &s;urgery, would advance more &s;peedily into employment and notice, than commonly happens where every individual is attempting to act in every branch of the profe&s;&s;ion, each of which, from its importance, is &s;ufficient for any one of us: Nor does this opinion re&s;t on &s;peculation, for wherever the mea&s;ure has ta|ken place, of &s;eparating as much as it can be done, the practice of &s;urgery from that of other branches of the profe&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e who have confined their attention to chirurgical pur&s;uits, have arrived much more early in life at the height of their
<PB N="21" REF="20">practice and reputation than otherwi&s;e could probably have been the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion, much additional argument might have been adduced on every part of it, if all that relates to it had not already been clearly &s;tated, and ably con&s;idered, in the Memorial which Dr GREGORY has lately taken the trouble to write on it, and which the whole of our number mu&s;t probably have read.</P>
<P>This Memorial indeed &s;ets forth in &s;trong colours, and in much variety of view, every argument that can well be ima|gined on the bu&s;ine&s;s to which it relates: but, while &s;ome complain of the length to which it extends, and of the a&s;pe|rity of manner with which it is written, we &s;hould recollect, that a very con&s;iderable part of it is employed in reply to tho&s;e arguments which our predece&s;&s;ors appear to have brought forth in &s;upport of a di&s;puted right; that on the que&s;tion arri|ving at the &s;tate in which it now is, and a&s;&s;uming a form which mu&s;t bring it to a deci&s;ion, the&s;e arguments came in the fir&s;t place, and of nece&s;&s;ity, to be refuted; that this is neither the fir&s;t nor the &s;econd attempt which the Managers of the Infirmary have made for the purpo&s;e of being relieved from their agreement with the College of Surgeons,&mdash;a cir|cum&s;tance, of which many who complain of the length of this Memorial have not probably been informed; that having, on all former occa&s;ions failed with means of a different nature, and de&s;pairing of greater &s;ucce&s;s from any other mode of at|tempting it, the Managers appear now to con&s;ider it as their duty, freely and fully, to &s;tate the whole to the public, pro|bably as a prelude to that que&s;tion of right which they &s;up|po&s;e the College of Surgeons may &s;till endeavour to maintain, but of which, for the rea&s;ons that I have given, I would glad|ly hope, that a majority of our number will not approve.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
<P>We ought al&s;o to con&s;ider, that nothing but the be&s;t and pure&s;t motives could actuate Dr GREGORY in this matter: having no private intere&s;t to &s;erve, nothing but the public good could have induced him to appear in it. As a Manager of a public Charity, labouring under an agreement which the Managers for the time being, have for the&s;e fifty years pa&s;t con&s;idered as hurtful, and have often, with much anxiety, en|deavoured to remove, he, with an unu&s;ual degree of public &s;pirit, has publi&s;hed one of the mo&s;t convincing papers which at any period perhaps has appeared, and has placed the matter in di&s;pute in &s;uch a light, as mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity accompli&s;h the end which he had in view from it: and if he has done this, without meaning to give offence to individuals, or to degrade either our College as a public body, or the profe&s;&s;ion in which we are engaged, which I firmly believe to have been the ca&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;peaking of his attempt in the manner which &s;ome, I am informed, have done, we ought to applaud the views which made him engage in it, as well as the abilities with which it has been conducted.</P>
<P>This intere&s;ting paper being &s;ufficiently able to &s;upport it|&s;elf, I have no other motive for &s;peaking of it, but that of wi&s;hing it to be read with that attention which it de&s;erves, particularly by all who wi&s;h for information on the que&s;tion to which it immediately relates; and I can venture to pre|dict, that few by whom this &s;hall be done, will require fur|ther evidence of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome plan for regulating the connection of the College of Surgeons with the Royal Infirmary, being &s;peedily carried into effect.</P>
<P>With no other views than tho&s;e which I have &s;tated, that the practice in which I am engaged, the art of &s;urgery, &s;hould be conducted on a plan, which I have rea&s;on to think would &s;ecure to the Royal Infirmary, to the pu|blic,
<PB N="23" REF="22">and to the College of Surgeons, all tho&s;e advantages which could not fail to re&s;ult from this important branch of our profe&s;&s;ion being improved; I have freely &s;et forth tho&s;e &s;entiments which I have long entertained of it, leaving it to the Managers of the Infirmary finally to re&s;olve on what ap|pears to be mo&s;t for the intere&s;t of the charge with which they are intru&s;ted.</P>
<P>In a matter which involves &s;uch various intere&s;ts, many of our number may incline to &s;tate their opinions to the Ma|nagers of the Infirmary, whatever the views may be which the College, as a public body, may adopt; and if this &s;hall be generally done, and with the &s;ame freedom of ob&s;ervation as my &s;entiments have thus been given, much important infor|mation would be obtained by the Managers, which otherwi&s;e they may never po&s;&s;e&s;s: I mean the views of tho&s;e, who, from &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idering the &s;ubject, and being intimately acquainted with every part of it, ought to be be&s;t able to judge of it: But, while much benefit might accrue from this information, the Managers will not probably reckon it &s;uffi|cient. In judging of &s;uch an important mea&s;ure, the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting, perhaps, which has ever occurred to them, they will &s;carcely re&s;t &s;atisfied with the opinions which individuals of this place may form of it: and if they &s;hall apply for infor|mation, as they probably will do, from London and other places, in which the &s;urgery of Ho&s;pitals is confined to a &s;mall number, and the whole chirurgical practice of the place conducted by a few, they will not fail to di&s;cover, that great advantages have been derived from it; and there|fore, that in fixing on a plan for this important object of their attention, they will have the aid of experience to de|pend on, in&s;tead of tru&s;ting, as otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have done, to di&s;cordant opinions and vague &s;peculations.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="23">
<P>With the Managers of the Infirmary, therefore, the bu&s;i|ne&s;s now mu&s;t re&s;t, who, having the public intere&s;t only at heart, will do in this matter, without regard to any other con|&s;ideration, what is mo&s;t for the intere&s;t of the Charity of which they have the charge; and acting on this &s;trong ground, as undoubtedly they will do, they will not fail to re|ceive, as on all occa&s;ions they have done, the mo&s;t ample proofs of public &s;upport and approbation.</P>
