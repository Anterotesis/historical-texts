<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Intention of the following Pages, with Difference to your illu&s;trious Body, is with all &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion laid at your Feet, carry|ing no other Views along with it, than to promote, the further Knowledge of <HI>medicine,</HI> the exact and artful Compo&s;ition of which is &s;o highly Nece&s;&s;a|ry, and conducive to the Welfare of Man|kind, and the Utility of the Publick.</P>
<P>I REST a&s;&s;ured of a candid Reception from the Nature of the De&s;ign, which I have the vanity to think you will favour, becau&s;e it is only level'd at a Reformation
<PB N="4" REF="3">&s;ome of the Errors in Compo&s;ition that have crept into former, and are &s;till retain'd in your la&s;t Edition of the <HI>London Di&s;pen&s;atory,</HI> and a further Recommendation of the many excellent Pre&s;criptions, which you have with Ju&s;tice to the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> continued and pub|li&s;h'd to the World, all which I &s;hall en|deavour to &s;upport by Authority, Rea&s;on and Experience; hence, I flatter my&s;elf with every thing that can be expected from a <HI>Society</HI> &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd for univer&s;al Lite|rature, as well as their particular Know|ledge in <HI>Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a meer Trifle which I offer, only as an E&s;&s;ay to what I have ready for the Pre&s;s, and to which I doubt not of your ge|nerous Approbation; for as 'the Study of your Lives is devoted to do Good, &s;o you will certainly promote every Thing that tends to that great End; and what is of more Importance than to pre&s;erve Life, and re|&s;tore to Man that valuable Ble&s;&s;ing of Health?</P>
<P>THIS Collection of <HI>Antidotes,</HI> altho', no <HI>Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> &s;hould happen (which God in his Mercy avert) is of univer&s;al Tendency, and &s;peaks for it&s;elf: The Au|thors were all Phy&s;icians of great Experi|ence, &s;ome of whom liv'd thro' five or &s;ix <HI>Plagues,</HI> in which they had been &s;ingularly &s;ucce&s;sful; and after that devouring Flame was Extingui&s;h'd, they had in all their &s;uc|ceeding Practice, &s;till a mighty E&s;teem for &s;uch Antidotes and Alexipharmicks as had
<PB N="5" REF="4">been Serviceable to them, when they &s;tood &s;o much in need of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, on which Oc|ca&s;ion they invented and introduced a whole Set or Collection of 'em, into Practice among which you have the various Pre&s;criptions of Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh's</HI> great Cordial, that of Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby's</HI> Diaphoretick, Ga&s;coyne Powder, with the Goa-Stone, and a great Variety of the <HI>Lapis Contrayerva,</HI> with many others; all which are very valuable in their Kinds, and con&s;equently, I doubt not but the Publication of this will meet with a Reception equal to the Merits of tho&s;e learned Gentlemen, who were the Compi|lers of the &s;everal Recipe's and Pre&s;criptions therein contain'd, which were certainly Stu|died and found U&s;eful for the publick Ser|vice.</P>
<P>NOW, let, me beg leave of your learned <HI>Society</HI> to make &s;ome decent and mode&s;t Remarks upon your la&s;t Edition, of your <HI>Pharmacopeia</HI> that from the Ju&s;tne&s;s of tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations, you your&s;elves may Judge of the Nece&s;&s;ity there is for a Refor|mation of the &s;ame, and from the Speci|mens I &s;hall give, make the World &s;en&s;ible of the U&s;efulne&s;s of &s;uch an Undertaking, which, with the la&s;t Regards due to your venerable Body, I &s;ubmit to impartial Judgment. And in the fir&s;t Place, I &s;hall not wa&s;t Time, either upon the Method, or Materials you have made Choice of in the Simples conducive to your <HI>Di&s;pen&s;atory,</HI> whether Roots, Barks, Woods, Herbs, Flow|ers,
<PB N="6" REF="5">Fruits, Seeds or the like, but do think it wou'd have been a Ju&s;tice due to the Publick, as well as an Advantage to the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> to have inform'd them, which of tho&s;e Simples mo&s;t con&s;tantly are in U&s;e, which are &s;eldom u&s;ed, and which are ne|ver u&s;ed at all; which Things are very Ma|terial, that Time and Money may not be thrown away upon what is perfectly U&s;ele&s;s; as the Roots of Anthorae an Exotick, cal|led the Counter-poi&s;on to Monk&s;hood, not Traffick'd in, and of no Virtues that are recommended by the Experience of the Faculty. 2dly. Arundinis Saccharina; the common Reed and Sugar-Cane Roots of no Medicinal u&s;e. The Roots of Kings Spear or A&s;phodel, Male and Female, not Us'd or even Sold in the Druggi&s;t, or Apothecaries Shops, and many more.</P>
<P>THE next are tho&s;e which, are &s;eldom, or very rarely u&s;ed, &s;uch as the <HI>Hermodactyls,</HI> Woad, Fullers Thi&s;tle, Hog-Fennel, Stinking Gladon, and an hundred others mention'd to little or no Purpo&s;e, which had been better left out, both for the ea&s;e of the Apothe|cary, and the Pre&s;criber, who is at fir&s;t em|barra&s;s'd in &s;o large a Field of Materials, loaded by &s;ome Authors with great Enco|comiums of the Feats they have done in Phy&s;ick, which are too apt to flatter and di|&s;appoint the Pre&s;umptions of a young Pra|ctitioner.</P>
<P>I SHALL pa&s;s by the re&s;t of the Simples in this &s;hort Account, and leave 'em to a
<PB N="7" REF="6">&s;tricter Enquiry, when I come to publi&s;h the <HI>Pharmacopeia Reformata,</HI> and &s;o proceed to &s;ome more material Ob&s;ervations, among which, I &s;hall fir&s;t take Notice of, the Oxy|mel &s;cilliticum, which you have Pre&s;crib'd ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as formerly, <HI>viz.</HI> Three <HI>Pounds of Clarified Honey, to two Pounds of Vinegar of Squills;</HI> whereas in Ju&s;tne&s;s to the Operation, and Effects of this <HI>Medicine,</HI> here &s;hould be three Pounds of Vinegar of <HI>Squills,</HI> to two Pounds of Honey, otherwi&s;e the <HI>Me|decine</HI> is &s;o clogg'd with the Honey, that the Efficacy thereof is lo&s;t, and the <HI>Acetum</HI> hath not power to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Dige&s;tion, cut the vi&s;cous Flegm, di&s;charge Wind and &s;our Belchings from the Stomach, and &s;trengthen the Appetite; for which it is a noble Re|medy, was it not &s;o very Nau&s;eous; but it may be excellently adapted by a skillful and judicious Phy&s;ician, who by mixing equal parts of the <HI>Acetum &s;cilliticum</HI> and Oxymel will gain his Intentions.</P>
<P>I CANNOT be &s;urpriz'd that you have overlook'd this among &s;o many other Com|po&s;itions, which are &s;o Faulty, that they are not capable of being made up or if they could, wou'd be of no U&s;e, &s;ince you are pleas'd to per&s;i&s;t in your daily Pra|ctice to pre&s;cribe Galbanum along with Am|moniacum, in order to be di&s;&s;olv'd, in black Cherry-water, or other the like Vehicle, and are angry with the Apothecary, when he tells you plain, that he knows not how to di&s;&s;olve <HI>Galbanum</HI> in an aqueous Body,
<PB N="8" REF="7">tho' <HI>Ammoniacum</HI> will familiarly do it; if this Point had been clear'd up in your la&s;t Edition, of the <HI>London Di&s;pen&s;atory,</HI> and new Rules given to the Apothecary, how to make his Di&s;&s;olution of <HI>Galbanum,</HI> this wou'd have been a great Improvement, and given a New turn to the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Medicines, but till then, we &s;hall believe it was not &s;o artfully Corrected, as we had Rea&s;on to expect from Per&s;ons &s;o well quali|fy'd; otherwi&s;e the <HI>Spiritus Lavendulae com|po&s;itus</HI> would hardly have remain'd in the Condition it &s;tands, con&s;idering it is &s;uch a <HI>Farrago</HI> of incon&s;i&s;tences unskilfully blend|ed, the Produce of which, is nothing at all; when at the &s;ame time the &s;imple Spirit of Lavender, is &s;o excellently u&s;eful, and may be enrich'd at the Phy&s;ician's plea&s;ure, with all the Volatile Aromaticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the Nature of the Ca&s;e, becoming by this Means a <HI>Spiritus Lavendulae Extemporaneo Compo&s;itus.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Aqua Paeoniae Compo&s;ita,</HI> or Peony-wa|ter Compound, is an excellent Pre&s;cription, but wants much of what it was from <HI>Langius,</HI> who calls it his <HI>Epileptick Water,</HI> which Re|ceipt I &s;hall give you (as it was Originally) in the <HI>Pharmacopeia Reformata;</HI> in the inte|rim it is high time to expunge <HI>Gilbert's Water,</HI> lea&s;t &s;ome evil minded People &s;hou'd deceive them&s;elves, and others, in putting their Tru&s;t therein.</P>
<P>As to the Treacle of <HI>Audromachus,</HI> and <HI>Mithridate,</HI> of which I can find no Reforma|tion made in your la&s;t Edition; it is one
<PB N="9" REF="8">grand Medley of a multitude of Simples jumbl'd together without Order or De&s;ign; the greate&s;t Part of which are either u&s;ele&s;s, or ineffectual. I &s;hall &s;atisfie my own Opi|nion only to declare that as generally us'd, and apply'd, they are both dangerous Me|dicines ill prepar'd, very Hot and of di&s;agree|able Qualities to the Intentions they are admini&s;tred. The grand Rea&s;on that has induc'd all Sorts of People to the U&s;e of them, have been drawn from the Authority and Experience of the Antients; <HI>Galen</HI> &s;ays they, hath &s;poken in Prai&s;e of <HI>Treacle</HI> in two Pieces of his, directed to <HI>Pi&s;o,</HI> and <HI>Pamphi|lianus.</HI> To which I an&s;wer, that the Autho|rity cited, is of no force, becau&s;e they do not appear to be <HI>Galen's</HI> Writings, but fal&s;ly attributed to him, which is the more Evi|dent from the Stile and Manner of Writing, which is foreign from that of <HI>Galen's,</HI> be&s;ides there are &s;everal Terms, and Words made U&s;e of not el&s;ewhere to be found in the &s;aid Author's Works, according to the learn'd <HI>Mercurialis,</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>in eo plurima verba a Galeno nu&s;quam u&s;urpata, fabulo&s;ae aliqua &amp; &s;tylus totus pene diver&s;us reperiuntur.</HI> The &s;ame Author &s;ays, there ought not to be the lea&s;t Fault in any of the Simples, that en|ter that Compo&s;ition, &s;peaking of <HI>Treacle Vitium enim unius Medicamenti totum Compo&s;i|tionem evertit.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY Body knows the great Abu&s;e in the Choice of Vipers, and that of the <HI>Mala|bathrum,</HI> which not one in an hundred makes
<PB N="10" REF="9">a right U&s;e of; be&s;ides this, the <HI>Myrrh</HI> we u&s;e, &s;etting a&s;ide the &s;mell, is nothing like that de&s;crib'd by <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> but rather <HI>Bdelliams,</HI> whereas the Troglotick is the fame, and we have no <HI>Opo-Bal&s;amum,</HI> true <HI>Co&s;tus, Schaenanth, Dictamny</HI> of <HI>Crete,</HI> or <HI>Falernian Wine.</HI> The ge|nerality of the <HI>Opium</HI> us'd at this Day, is no|thing near &s;o fine, or good as <HI>Mathiolus</HI> re|lates, and &s;carce &s;eems to be like what <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> de&s;cribes: For it is a perfect <HI>Meconium</HI> at this Day, as may be evidently Proved,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mithridate</HI> commonly met with in the Shops, is in the &s;ame Condition, having the &s;ame Faults and Imperfections, and therefore ought to be rejected, being too hot and acrid for the Intentions it is generally Pre&s;crib'd, con&s;equently it wants a con|&s;iderable Reformation, or el&s;e ought to be expung'd the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;atory.</HI></P>
<P>THE Confection of <HI>Alkermes,</HI> altho' ve|ry prudently dive&s;ted of its Perfumes now a-days, is a Compo&s;ition very unartfully Invented and De&s;crib'd by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and very little Reform'd and Amended by the Moderns, who &s;till clo&s;ely pur&s;ue the Er|rors of the <HI>Arabian Phy&s;icians:</HI> Indeed the <HI>Lapis Laruli</HI> has been long &s;ince thrown out, and there remains little behind in this Me|dicine, which bears a high Name, but what we may expect from the Juice or Sy|rup of the <HI>Chermes-Berry</HI> with better Suc|ce&s;s; for as to the <HI>Aloes Wood,</HI> we know little or nothing of it, and the Leaf-Gold there|in,
<PB N="11" REF="10">is a meer Amu&s;ement to Deceive the Credulous. <HI>Rondeletius</HI> in&s;tead of &s;peaking in its Prai&s;e gives a &s;evere Caution again&s;t the U&s;e of it, which is Back'd by Mr. <HI>Fer|rier,</HI> a Phy&s;ician of <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> who blames Phy|&s;icians for the too plentiful Pre&s;cribing there|of: See the <HI>Annotations</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> of Mr. <HI>Guillemeau.</HI> The Confect of <HI>Hyacinth</HI> bears a great Re&s;emblance to this, only that the la&s;t &s;eems to be endowed with no Cor|dial Virtue at all: Notwithanding the great Boa&s;ts made of it, from the Fragments of Precious-Stones, that enter the Compo&s;iti|on, by the &s;plendid &s;hew of which, together, with the Leaf-Gold, many are induced to believe it is capable of performing Wonders.</P>
<P>AS I was treating of <HI>Mithridate,</HI> I mu&s;t take the Liberty to return to the Subject, to &s;hew that when <HI>Pompey</HI> found the Receipt thereof written in <HI>Mithridates</HI> own Hand, after the Defeat of that Prince, which he e|&s;teem'd as a vaulable Secret; it was Com|pounded but of very few Simples, and tho&s;e very common ones according to the follow|ing <HI>Di&s;tick.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Compo&s;ition then con&s;i&s;ted, only of two Walnuts, two Figs, Twenty leaves of <HI>Rue</HI> &s;tamp'd together, with a little Salt; and this was reckon'd a &s;overeign Antidote again&s;t any maglignant Air for 24 Hours together, it being &s;ufficient for three or four Morning Do&s;es, drinking after it a Gla&s;s of white Wine</P>
<P>THE next thing to be enquir'd into, is to know the Rea&s;on, why you &s;till admit Leaf-Gold into &s;everal Preparations, &s;ince you very well know it is neither Cordial, Corro|borative, Alterative, or does it any wi&s;e con|tribute to the Nutrition of the Parts accord|ing to <HI>Galen,</HI> in his Commentary on the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Hippocrates, de ratione Victus in Acutis.</HI> It can by no Means be call'd an Alterative, in that the natural Di&s;po&s;ition of the Body cannot be affected by Rea&s;on of the Solidity of its Parts, &s;o that it can nei|ther heat or cool, dry or moi&s;ten the &s;olid, or fluid Parts, and how it becomes Purga|tive I cannot imagine; all which makes good what <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar Scaliger,</HI> &s;ays in his Exer|citations again&s;t <HI>Cardan</HI> Exerc. 272. There ought to be &s;ome Re&s;emblance, &s;ome like|ne&s;s in Configuration of Parts; between what gives the Nutriment, and the Body that receives it. Metals are proper to unite with, and feed Metals, but are imcompati|ble, and foreign to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and in|crea&s;e of Animals. If Gold is good in any Di&s;ea&s;e, it mu&s;t certainly be &s;o in the <HI>Hypochondriack, Melancholy,</HI> e&s;pecially when
<PB N="13" REF="12">it is admini&s;tred, not as the <HI>Arabians,</HI> in Pills or Powders, or as the Chymi&s;ts in Potions like their <HI>Aurum Potabile,</HI> but plen|tifully in Specie, or Golden Showers; nay, if the Phy&s;ician cou'd but pre&s;cribe <HI>Bank</HI> Bills, his pre&s;criptions would infallibly Cure all the Vapours in Town. This is a Specifick, even again&s;t <HI>South-Sea</HI> Head-Ach, which, is otherwi&s;e an incurable Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>AND here I cannot forbear to hint at the pre&s;ent u&s;e of <HI>Ivory,</HI> that is &s;till con|tinued, and recommended in many good Medicines, when every Body knows, and is thoroughly per&s;waded that <HI>Harts-Horn,</HI> has an hundred times the Virtue, &s;ince the o|ther neither di&s;covers Smell or Ta&s;te, or any Quality to recommend it for an ef|ficacious Medicine; &s;everal Phy&s;icians have long &s;ince exploded it, as <HI>Durel Hantin, Mercurialis, Baccius, Sylvaticus Era&s;tus, Al|bertus, Sebizius,</HI> and others; but <HI>Ambro&s;e Pa|rey,</HI> by dint of Rea&s;on and Experience re|futes, all the pretended and imaginary Qua|lities a&s;&s;ign'd to this u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant Drug.</P>
<P>THEREFORE it becomes more my Admi|ration, that Gentlemen who have con|&s;ulted, and weigh'd all the&s;e things toge|ther in the Balance of Rea&s;on, &s;hould &s;till continue the U&s;e of many u&s;ele&s;s, and ex|travagant Drugs, which are now directed in the &s;everal Compo&s;itions of your <HI>Di&s;pen&s;a|tory,</HI> many of which are rarely, or not to be got at all, and others at a very dear Rate,
<PB N="14" REF="13">and good for little or nothing; the fir&s;t of which I mean is, the Bone of a Stags Heart, the others are Ambergree&s;e, Musk, and Be|zoar &s;o frequently pre&s;cribed on all Occa&s;i|ons, in the la&s;t of which there are &s;o many vile Cheats practic'd, that it is a pity it &s;hould lye in the power of avaritious, and de&s;igning Men to Cozen and Deceive the World, with &s;uch vile Frauds.</P>
<P>TWO Parts in three of the Bezoar, of which is &s;old and made U&s;e of in the Shops is, Fa|ctitious, and the other that is Natural, is only fit to Deceive &s;uch as are willing to be Deceiv'd, and take a Plea&s;ure to be carry'd down with the Stream of popular Errors. As to the Factitious, it is generally made up of <HI>Gall-Stones,</HI> found in the Gall-Bladders of Oxen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Lemnian Earth</HI> findly ground with a little <HI>Ambergree&s;e,</HI> and &s;o form'd in|to Stones of various Sizes and Figures; and thus the &s;ubtle Arti&s;t cheats the Apothecary with his Counterfeit Stone, and the Phy&s;ici|an comes into the Confederacy, by pre&s;crib|ing his Bezoartick Bolus, or Powder to pick the Patient's Pocket: This fallacy up|on the credulous Sick, will in a little time become as de&s;picable, as the vain Pretenti|ons of the <HI>Alchymi&s;ts,</HI> with their <HI>Aurum Pota|tabile,</HI> their <HI>Sulphur</HI> of <HI>Metals,</HI> and <HI>Powder</HI> of <HI>Projection,</HI> with which they Bubble the Ig|norant, and blind the Eyes of the more di&s;cerning part of Mankind.</P>
<P>I HOPE to God, that you Gentlemen, who have both Honour, Ju&s;tice and Judg|ment,
<PB N="15" REF="14">will put a &s;top to the&s;e Deceits where|by the People are Cheated with fal&s;e Medi|cines, which under the pompous Preten&s;i|ons of curing more Effectually, are made a Handle of, to extract Gold and Silver from the Patients Pur&s;e: A Reformation of the&s;e things would be a great Advantage to all Parties, and who can we expect it from, but your learned Body, who by your Example, and Authority have Power to Reform, and at the &s;ame time inform the World what your Opinions are in relation to &s;uch co&s;t|ly Drugs, as <HI>Bezoar,</HI> and whether the good Effects and Virtues thereof are an&s;werable to the Phy&s;icians Expectation, and that of the Patient; if not, that you wou'd ingeniou&s;ly declare this Stone naturally, as brought from <HI>India,</HI> and un&s;ophi&s;tieated hath no more Virtue than &s;ome of our Foreign Earths, or Dome&s;tick Chalks.</P>
<P>IT is pretended by the Advocates for this Stone, that it is a mo&s;t noble <HI>Alexipharmick,</HI> and is both <HI>Cordial</HI> and <HI>Sudorifick,</HI> tho' it does not appear from the Compo&s;ition of its Parts, being Gro&s;s and Earthy, how it can encrea&s;e or otherwi&s;e alter the Motion of the Blood, or exhilerate the Spirits, which it &s;eems not to have power to fortifie, and &s;upport.

The <HI>Sena,</HI> which <HI>Me&s;ue</HI> from the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> calls <HI>Abal|zemer,</HI> is a Plant or Shrub, the Leaves whereof Re&s;emble tho&s;e of Liquorice, it &s;hoots up and &s;preads with many &s;mall Branches, which are very pliant, the Flowers are yel|low, with certain Threads or red Streaks underneath, after which &s;hoot forth certain Follicula or Buds clo&s;ely folded, which hang upon the Plant, by a &s;lender Tail, which is very fine, and naturally flat; the&s;e Buds when Ripe ea&s;ily fall by the force of the Wind, and contain in them a Seed which is of a greeni&s;h black Colour, and &s;o like the Stone of a Rai&s;in, that it is hard to know the difference; <HI>Serapion</HI> in his Book of <HI>Simples</HI> &s;ays, the&s;e Buds are longi&s;h, and in form of a Cro&s;s, in which the Seed is lodg'd.
<PB N="19" REF="18">They are much Deceived, who think that the Tree which <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> calls <HI>Colutea</HI> to be our <HI>Sena;</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Colutea</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Baguenaudier</HI> bears large <HI>Follicu|les</HI> or <HI>Buds,</HI> which the Shepherds and Pe|&s;ants gather to feed their Cattle with, be|&s;ides, there is a va&s;t difference, in that the <HI>Sena</HI> is an Herb or Plant that la&s;ts but a few Months, and the <HI>Bagnenaudier</HI> is a Tree that continues many Years; notwith&s;tand|ing which the &s;ame Virtues have been a&s;crib|ed to the la&s;t, as to that of <HI>Sena,</HI> and the Merchant impos'd upon as well as the Drug|gi&s;t in buying the one for the other. <HI>Me&s;ue</HI> &s;ays, that the <HI>Sena</HI> hath much more Virtue and Efficacy in the Bud than the Leaf, e&s;pe|cially if of the Dark green Colour a little bitteri&s;h, &s;tiptick and a&s;tringent in Ta&s;t, and gather'd when fre&s;h, for otherwi&s;e the Virtue is lo&s;t. The white Buds are good for nothing, the green Leaves, better than the white, and the thick ones than the thin, but the Stalks of no U&s;e at all; and this agrees very well with what <HI>Matthiolus</HI> writes in his learned Commentaries on <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> he &s;ays indeed, there are two Sorts of the&s;e Buds, the one of which is gather'd when dry and fallen from the Plant, which have no Virtue in them, and the other is gathered upon the Plant before it is dry and wither'd, and the&s;e are thick Leaves, and full of Sap, being afterwards skillfully dry'd in the Shade.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P><HI>Manardus,</HI> a Phy&s;ician of <HI>Ferrara</HI> main|tains, that the Leaves of the <HI>Sena</HI> have a greater Purgative Quality than the Buds, but then he takes 'em for &s;uch as dropt from the Tree ready dry'd; but <HI>Fernelius</HI> who was undoubtedly a more knowing Judge of Medicine, follows <HI>Me&s;ue</HI> and <HI>Matthiolus</HI> in preferring the <HI>Buds</HI> to the <HI>Leaves,</HI> and <HI>Syl|vius</HI> &s;ub&s;cribes to the &s;ame Opinion, in his Commentaries upon <HI>Me&s;ue,</HI> Whoever hath a Mind to U&s;e the Buds, mu&s;t ob&s;erve this De&s;cription, but &s;uch as like the Leaves better, mu&s;t chu&s;e tho&s;e of the brighte&s;t Colour, large and fre&s;h, and free from all Smell, rejecting the pale and dead Colour'd as u&s;ele&s;s.
