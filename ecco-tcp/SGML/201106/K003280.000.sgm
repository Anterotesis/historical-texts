<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE NATURE and METHOD Of TREATING the GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is certain, that many Treati&s;es have been publi&s;hed on this im|portant Subject, and con&s;idera|ble Di&s;coveries and Improve|ments made to the Science of Phy&s;ick; yet, it is manife&s;t, the A&s;&s;iduity of the Learned, and the mo&s;t Inqui&s;itive,
<PB N="4" REF="3">have hitherto failed, to find out a Specific in this Di&s;temper, which is too con&s;picuous in the Practice: Therefore, I hope this &s;hort Tract will be acceptable, and not deemed a &s;uperficial Performance.</P>
<P>THE Ba&s;is of the De&s;ign is, Rea&s;on and Experience, adapted to every Con&s;titution and Age; and, I do not apprehend, but will an&s;wer the grand Intention, not only alleviating the Symptoms, but effectually the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Virtues of the Cortex where known, many Di&s;tempers were removed with great Difficulty; and if the Public will but give me Leave, I &s;hall endeavour to render this Method apparently as efficacious in the Cure of the GOUT, as the Cortex is in Fevers.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e is called in <HI>Greek</HI> &Asmogr;&rgr;&thgr;&rgr;&ismogr;&tgr;&igr;&sfgr;, in <HI>Latin Arthritis,</HI> the GOUT; and by affecting various Parts, has received as ma|ny Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> &Osmogr;&ngr;&aacugr;&ggr;&rgr;&agr;, the GOUT in the Shoulder; &KHgr;&egr;&igr;&rgr;&aacugr;&ggr;&rgr;&agr;, the GOUT in the Hand; &Ismogr;&sgr;&khgr;&igr;&agragr;&sfgr;, in or about that Bone that is connected to the <HI>Os Ilium;</HI> &Ggr;&ogr;&ngr;&aacugr;&ggr;&rgr;&agr;, in the Knee; and &Pgr;&ogr;&dgr;&aacugr;&ggr;&rgr;&agr;, in the Foot.</P>
<P>I SHALL confine my&s;elf to treat of the&s;e two, that implies all the other, <HI>viz.</HI> Here|ditary,
<PB N="5" REF="4">and Adventitious. The fir&s;t de&s;|cending from the Parents, the Adventitious from Cau&s;es ari&s;ing through Intemperance in the Non-Naturals, but both, from an Efferve&s;cence of the nervous Juice with the &s;aline Particles of the Blood, received with our Food, or too great Freedom of &s;piritu|ous Fluids: Whence the Nerves, Tendons, Ligaments, the Membranes about the Bones are tormented; and from whence proceed Swellings, Redne&s;s, hard &s;andy Concretions on the Joints.</P>
<P>WHAT Time of the Year this Di&s;tem|per invades, is no material Circum&s;tance; but it is certain, that in hereditary GOUTS, be the Regimen ever &s;o &s;trict, the Patient &s;hall have one or more Fits.</P>
<P>THE Acquired, or Adventitious, comes unexpectedly, and no certain Time of Con|tinuance.</P>
<P>THE Signs are, a vehement Pain in the Joints, <HI>viz.</HI> the Heel, the Ancle, Leg, or the Knee, but not to all alike. Pre&s;ently after a Chillne&s;s with a &s;haking Fit, and a &s;light Fever &s;ucceeds, which increa&s;es with Pain, &s;o exqui&s;ite, as is hardly to be endured; the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Bed-Cloaths, or the lea&s;t Motion in the Room, giving Unea&s;ine&s;s, and continues &s;ome
<PB N="6" REF="5">little Time before it remits; then a gen|tle Sweat coming on, the Pain abates, and the Sick falls into Sleep, and the Part affected is immediately found to &s;well. The following, and perhaps for many Days af|ter, it may return with equal Violence in the Evening, and gradually go off in the Morning. In like Manner other Parts at that Time may be affected, and with the Severity of Pain, until the principal Pa|roxy&s;m is compleat, which is longer or &s;horter, according to the Quantity of Salts, as well, as the Age of the Sick.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch who are young and &s;trong, and have &s;eldom the GOUT, the Fit may con|tinue fourteen or &s;ixteen Days; but in el|derly People, and &s;uch as are frequently af|flicted, it generally holds for two Months: Such as are broken, or much weakned, either by their Years, or a long Continu|ance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, it is mo&s;t commonly &s;ix Months, more or le&s;s, or till the Heat of the Summer.</P>
<P>IN the Increa&s;e of the Fit, the Urine is commonly of a high Colour, with a red Sediment, abounding with Sand, and the Belly u&s;ually co&s;tive; a depraved Appetite, a Coldne&s;s &s;eizes the whole Body about Evening, which continues the whole Fit.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>IN the decline, the Part or Parts are &s;ubject to a violent itching, from whence falls a Leprous kind of Scurff.</P>
<P>WHEN the GOUT is enraged by Medi|cines un&s;kilfully applied, and the Length and Ob&s;tinacy of the Di&s;ea&s;e perverted, other Parts are then infected, as Head, Shoulders, Stomach, Hands, Wri&s;ts, Elbows, and &s;ome|times one or more of the Fingers are di&s;|torted, or made crooked, and at length ge|nerating Tophs, and chalky Concretions like Crabs-Eyes, which in Time break the Skin, and fall out, and fre&s;h Chalk comes in their Place.</P>
<P>IT frequently afflicts the Thigh and Hip, that the Patient complains of an heavy Weight, but without exqui&s;ite Pain; and the Sick have their Joints almo&s;t every Way contracted and weakned, e&s;pecially the Knees, whereby the U&s;e for a long while is taken away; and by frequent Tits to tho&s;e Pares mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed, partly by Age and Weakne&s;s, a total Lo&s;s en&s;ues.</P>
<P>THE Urine, in the Decline of a Fit, is generally loaded with Sand; and too fre|quently, if the Di&s;ea&s;e happens to be of a long Duration, &s;o as to confine the Patient
<PB N="8" REF="7">from Motion, is <HI>the Beginning of a Fit of the Stone.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved, that as the Fever is, that u&s;hers in the GOUT, &s;o will be the Fit; if the Fever be &s;hort and &s;harp, the Fit will be &s;o.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>It is the general Opinion, that a tar|tarous urinous Salt, is the princi|pal Cau&s;e of this Di&s;temper.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PARACELSUS</HI> terms it <HI>Morbus Tar|tareus,</HI> as proceeding from, and cau&s;ed of <HI>Tartar;</HI> a Mixture of an acid Liquor or Salt, with the Synovia, which is a tran&s;parent Mucilage, like the White of Eggs; and this being hardened, is the chalky Matter &s;o common to gouty Per|&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Helmont</HI> &s;ays, its Original is in the Sto|mach, which breeds an Acid, which in&s;i|nuating
<PB N="9" REF="8">it&s;elf into the Synovia, coagulates it, and by a preternatural Heat, it is hard|ened into Chalk; and that the Inten&s;ene&s;s, or Remi&s;sne&s;s of the Pain, is to be attri|buted, according to the Difference of the Salts. But the intemperate U&s;e of Wines, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the <HI>French,</HI> I believe to be a very good Rea&s;on, we have &s;o fre|quent Complaints of the Ob&s;tinacy of this Di&s;temper; for the &s;maller the Body of the Wine is, &s;o much the more is it loaded with tartarous Salt: Likewi&s;e an immode|rate Freedom of Port-Wines has a vrey bad Effect, but more &s;o, if ever &s;o little prickt, as Experience has demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>SOME hereditary gouty Subjects, that have &s;everely &s;uffer'd, and had a narrow E&s;cape for their Lives, I have known en|tirely for&s;ake their darling Liquor, and take to <HI>Madeira</HI> Wine, or Brandy mixt with a little Water, and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few proper Medicines, continued free for a long Time, that before the Regimen have been &s;ubject to tedious and long Fits.</P>
<P>THE adventitious GOUT, is known to proceed immediately from the immoderate U&s;e of Wine, or fermented Liquors; where|by, the acid Faeculencies remaining in the Stomach, become an acid and vitious Tar|tar, corrupting the Lympha and Juices,
<PB N="10" REF="9">create the antecedent Cau&s;e, which Nature, in her Defence, to pre&s;erve the principal Parts, forces to the Extreams, as the Joints of the Hands, Arms, Legs, and Feet, which irritates and hurts the Fibres of the Nerves and Tendons, and thereby cau&s;es Pain, Tu|mour, Redne&s;s, and Inflamation. This Matter remaining long in the Parts affected, for want of proper Remedies to carry it off, by Degrees coagulates, and becomes Chalk or Stone.</P>
<P>A LATE learned Gentleman, who wrote a Treati&s;e on this Di&s;temper, &s;ays, that an hereditary GOUT is ingraned and tran&s;ub|&s;tantiated into the Solids, and impo&s;&s;ible to be rooted out by Art and Indu&s;try; but &s;peaks more favourable of an acquired, as being more confined to the Fluids, a pro|per Diet, due Exerci&s;e, and a few well cho&s;en Remedies may go a great Way, if not to a perfect Cure, yet to make Life to|lerably ea&s;y; but I hope my Endeavours will convince the World of this Error, by &s;hewing, that there are Medicines, that will in mo&s;t Ca&s;es totally remove this Com|plaint, and at the &s;ame Time, &s;trengthen the Tone of the Stomach.</P>
<P>THIS is the e&s;&s;ential Rea&s;on of the wri|ting this Treati&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> to remove this <HI>in|graned and tran&s;ub&s;tantiated Conception,</HI> and
<PB N="11" REF="10">to make it appear, that it may be done, with as much Safety and Certainty, as any other Di&s;temper; and that either hereditary or adventitious GOUTS, in Proportion to the offending Salts, may be effectually re|moved: And if the Patient be but freed from chalky Concretions, and of a Con&s;ti|tution not too much broken with frequent Paroxy&s;ms, to prevent a Relap&s;e; but if &s;o worn out with Age, and frequent returns of the Fit, I can a&s;&s;ure him of a better State of Health, tho' not ab&s;olutely of a Cure.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<HEAD>The general and direct Method in Curing the GOUT in the Fits, is a gentle Per&s;piration and breath|ing Sweat by Medicines, repeated twice a Day, as long as the Fit continues; that cau&s;es no Sickne&s;s at the Stomach, and that are ea|&s;ily dige&s;ted, giving a gradual Heat and Warmth through the Body.</HEAD>
<P>DILUTION frequently by proper Li|quors, &s;uch as old &s;mall Beer, with a little <HI>Madeira</HI> Wine; Water boiled with a few Spices, mixt with a little Brandy, that may lie warm on the Stomach: Thin Wa|ter-Gruel with <HI>Madeira</HI> Wine, during all the Time of the Fever, is not to be omitted, Liquors may be more freely indulged than &s;olid Food, and are always to be regulated by their Lightne&s;s on, and Agreeablene&s;s to
<PB N="13" REF="12">the Stomach, and by their not rendring the Patient more hot and re&s;tle&s;s than the GOUT it&s;elf would do; for whatever cau&s;es Sickne&s;s, mu&s;t of Cour&s;e draw in the gouty Matter; but if it produce an agreeable Sen|&s;ation, and not inflame, will procure Cool|ne&s;s and Re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Diet ought to be ea&s;y of Dige&s;tion, &s;uch as Sagoe, or Panado, with a little <HI>Ma|deira</HI> Wine, or Brandy, or Jellies, little or no fle&s;h Meat during the Fever, is be&s;t, and that the Patient &s;hould eat &s;paringly; for overmuch feeding nouri&s;hes the Di&s;ea&s;e: All Salt and pickled Meats, and Food of large Nouri&s;hment is to be avoided. The Body is to be kept &s;oluble, which is com|monly the rever&s;e, but may ea&s;ily be &s;o, by a &s;imple Gly&s;ter of Broth, now and then, with a few carminative Seeds boiled in it.</P>
<P>THE Urine is to pa&s;s freely and plenti|fully, becau&s;e &s;ometimes a good Part of the morbific Matter may be carried off that Way. Immoderate Sleeping and Watch|ing is to be avoided, likewi&s;e Venery.</P>
<P>IF the Patient can &s;uffer Motion, it is better to u&s;e it, by which the Calculus is prevented.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P>LASTLY, The Mind is to be kept &s;e|rene and plea&s;ant, a chearful Friend, and a Gla&s;s of good <HI>Madeira</HI> Wine will keep up the Spirits, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure le&s;&s;en the Fatigue of a tedious Confinement.</P>
<P>BY this Method, I am certain, this &s;tub|born Di&s;temper is to be removed, and have known &s;ome to have been freed from it for &s;everal Years, who by Intemperance and Irregularities of Life, have taken as great Pains for a Relap&s;e; but this is to be attri|buted chiefly to the Goodne&s;s of their Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>To &s;peak &s;omething of the Medicines that have this &s;alutiferous Effect. The <HI>Pro|fe&s;&s;ors in Phy&s;ick</HI> do generally concur, that if a Medicine could be di&s;covered, that would &s;weat the Part affected, it would be the only and infallible Means of Succe&s;s, and the propere&s;t Way to remove the Load of tartarous Salts and vi&s;cous Matter, which is the principal Motive of this chronical Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, the Nature of the&s;e Medicines are of &s;uch Effect, &s;uppo&s;ing the Complaint in the Foot (which is a con&s;iderable Di&s;|tance from the Stomach) that &s;oon after the fir&s;t Do&s;e is received, they have this Con|&s;equence,
<PB N="15" REF="14"><HI>viz.</HI> give the Patient very &s;en&s;ible Rea&s;on of its reaching that Part, by an ad|ditional Warmth and Moi&s;ture; Indications &s;ufficient to a gouty Per&s;on. And if one Do&s;e have &s;o great Effect, what mu&s;t re|&s;ult from repeated Do&s;es every Day, but removeing the Ob&s;truction, enlarging the Pores braced tight with Pain and Angui&s;h, and by a full and free Per&s;piration &s;etting at Liberty the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to &s;ome invidious People, who attribute the Operation of the Medicines to a Preparation of Mercury; others again to Antimony; and from the quick and unex|pected Relief the Patient &s;o &s;uddenly re|ceives, to &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the opiate Tribe.</P>
<P>THE publi&s;hing this Secret would imme|diately convince them of their gro&s;s Errors, be&s;ides, a ponderous Medicine as Mercury or Antimony mu&s;t of Cour&s;e detect it&s;elf; but I &s;hall at this Time wave the Argu|ment, and when proper make it publick; but to &s;atisfy the timerous, &s;hall &s;o far de|clare, that there is not one Grain of an O|piate, or tho&s;e Minerals in the Compo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>IT is certain, Minerals, &s;uch as Mer|cury and Antimony, have been us'd, but
<PB N="16" REF="15">prudently condemned as dangerous Medi|cines, breaking and tearing the &s;malle&s;t and fine&s;t Ve&s;&s;els and Fibres, by their Particles, &s;o that the Body, when the Blood is reple|ni&s;hed again with gouty Salts, becomes in a wor&s;e State in re&s;pect of the future Fits, which will become more painful and ob&s;ti|nate, than they would have been in &s;everal Years Time under the common Symptoms.</P>
<P>AND as to Opiates, they are never to be given but in Extremities, when the Patient has been many Days without Re&s;t, and not then, but by joining &s;picy nervous and &s;to|mach Medicines to them: So that it is plain, nothing of that kind can be in the Compo&s;ition, which is to be admini&s;ter'd Morning and Evening, and has no other Effect, but a gentle Per&s;piration and breath|ing Sweat, and &s;o repeated for a few Days, the Symptoms of a regular Fit are com|pleatly carried off.</P>
<P>THE irregular GOUTS, where the Con|&s;titution is broken and impaired, and the gouty Humour fixes on the Head, the In|tention to be had in View is to expel the &s;aid Humour outwardly upon the Mu&s;cles and Joints, and to fix it there; and is to be treated as any other violent Head-Ach, or as an Inflamation on the Brain, by bleed|ing in the Foot, bli&s;tering on the Ancles
<PB N="17" REF="16">to give the gouty Matter a vent down|wards. Some Authors are bold enough to pre&s;cribe mercurial and antimonial Vomits, but they are &s;eldom to be ventured on in any Con&s;titution, for the active Part of the GOUT is too dangerous to be attempted by &s;uch an Operation; even Bleeding, with|out an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, is not to be ad|mitted of, but when other mild Methods has been ineffectually u&s;ed. Gentle &s;to|mach Purges may be frequently and &s;afely repeated (but Care mu&s;t be taken that the Medicines be not too hot, e&s;pecially in young &s;anguine Con&s;titutions) and at the &s;ame Time Endeavours mu&s;t be made towards a powerful Evacuation by the Pores, which will not fail &s;pending the gouty Humour.</P>
<P>THE GOUT in the Stomach is a com|mon and le&s;s dangerous Ca&s;e, for it rarely comes on or goes off without touching there, and is as ea&s;ily removed; but to|wards the Decline of Life, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e that have been long afflicted, the Pa|roxy&s;m generally of great Length, is more ob&s;tinate, e&s;pecially when it &s;ettles in a con&s;tant Pain, and in nau&s;eating and keck|ing in the Stomach.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<P>THO' Vomits are reckon'd dangerous in the GOUT, le&s;t they &s;hould derive the Humour on the Stomach; yet I have known &s;ome, contrary to Advice, bold enough to make Experiment, and that have done it without any vi&s;ible Alteration on either Side. Upon the fir&s;t Seizure of the Stomach, a gentle Vomit is by &s;ome pre|&s;cribed, as a Do&s;e of the <HI>Indian root</HI> and re|peated as they found Occa&s;ion; but, I ne|ver had a Patient that pur&s;ued my Method of Evacuation by Sweat, to have any Call for &s;uch an Operation, therefore cannot ea|&s;ily admit of the Remedy. Stomach Pur|ges, &s;uch as <HI>Hiera Picra,</HI> with Tincture of <HI>Diambra,</HI> or Snake-root, bli&s;ters on the Ancles, highe&s;t Cordials, and mo&s;t gene|rous Wines, may be now freely indulged, and without any Fear of Inflamation; but if the GOUT &s;hould continue &s;till in the Stomach, and become habitual, then the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters with Steel, the afore&s;aid Sto|mach Purges frequently repeated, a regular Diet and Exerci&s;e, perpetual Bli&s;ters be|tween the Thighs, powerful Evacuation by the Pores, cupping between the Shoul|ders, or Bleeding in the Foot, are the only Means effectually to remove it.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>THE GOUT in the Inte&s;tines, mu&s;t be treated altogether as in the Stomach, and no Opiates to be u&s;ed, but in the la&s;t Ex|tremity.</P>
<P>BUT if there &s;hould be a Tran&s;lation of the offending Matter from the Stomach, or el&s;ewhere, to the Lobes of the Lungs, you mu&s;t behave in the &s;ame Manner, as if it was an ab&s;olute <HI>Peripneumonia,</HI> or Inflama|tion on the Lungs.</P>
<P>THESE are Ca&s;es that are generally at|tended with great Fatigue and Danger, yet I &s;hall exhibit an In&s;tance of a Gentleman in a hereditary Fit of the GOUT, and near Seventy Years of Age, who had been a Cripple by the chalky Concretions in his Knees full twenty Years, and had entirely lo&s;t the U&s;e of his Legs; and, during the Paroxy&s;m, the Stomach was affected with a continual Pain and Heat; no Liquids but the mo&s;t &s;pirituous, &s;uch as Brandy, or <HI>A|qua Mirabilis,</HI> would re&s;t on his Stomach.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome Weeks, and various Me|thods had ineffectually been made u&s;e of, I was admitted, and gave him the Medi|cines, and along with them, warm &s;pice
<PB N="20" REF="19">&s;tomach Medicines, which continu'd for twelve or fourteen Days, remov'd it from his Stomach into his Hand and Elbow, whereby the Tone of the Stomach was re&s;|tored, and the Fit gradually carried off.</P>
<P>I MIGHT in&s;tance many Ca&s;es that would have proved dangerous, if it had not been for the&s;e Remedies, but for Brevity &s;ake mu&s;t omit them.</P>
<P>SINCE hereditary and adventitious GOUTS proceed from one and the &s;ame Principal, a tartarous Salt, having &s;een no remarkable Difference worthy Ob&s;ervation, but that an Adventitious in &s;ome Con&s;titu|tions has been equally as violent as the other, I &s;hall treat them alike.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, a GOUT in a Per&s;on of a firm &s;tiff &s;tate of Nerves, of a middle Age, and free from chalky Concretions, I may venture to a&s;&s;ure him of a Cure, in the Time of fourteen or twenty-one Days, by taking the Medicines.</P>
<P>A nervous GOUT in a loo&s;e, flabby, and relaxed State, and of the &s;ame Age, a few Days longer; but when a&s;cending to|wards the grand Climacteric, then the Time
<PB N="21" REF="20">cannot &s;o ea&s;ily be limited: However, I may affirm, that it will be barely half the Time of the cu&s;tomary Length of the Pa|roxy&s;m.</P>
<P>IN young Subjects, I have known the Cure performed in ten or twelve Days, to an entire Extirpation; and this great Bene|fit obtain'd by no other Method, than Me|dicines that promote Evacuation by Sweat, that cau&s;e no Sickne&s;s, Thir&s;t, or any In|conveniency whatever, but &s;it ea&s;y on the Stomach.</P>
<P>IN the Practice of ten Years in this Di&s;|temper, I do not remember an In&s;tance of the GOUT either hereditary or adventitious, that with&s;tood the Efficacy of the&s;e Me|dicines &s;o long a Time as a Month, tho' the Patient has had both Legs and Arms at the &s;ame Time affected, neither an In&s;tance of a Relap&s;e. And, I am certain, if this Practice was but generally known, it would meet with a proper Encouragement, in &s;pite of the Ob&s;tacles that attend an Under|taking of this Nature, that has not the Sanction of the Superiors in Phy&s;ick; but I hope in Time, every one will be convin|ced, that the &s;ole End and De&s;ign is im|mediately calculated for a publick Benefit;
<PB N="22" REF="21">and that it may appear more &s;o, and take off all Thoughts of an Impo&s;ition, I am willing to wait upon any one that &s;hall de|&s;ire it, and &s;atisfy them, by Word of Mouth, of the Efficacy of the Method. And, as no Reward is expected till the CURE is effectually performed, &s;o I hope no QUACKERY can be a&s;cribed to this Manner of PURLICATION.</P>
