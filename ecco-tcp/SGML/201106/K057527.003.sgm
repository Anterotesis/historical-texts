<ARGUMENT>
<P>Meet with a mortifying di&s;appointment.&mdash; An extraordinary character.&mdash;He gives &s;ome very important advice.&mdash;I expe|rience one of the ill con&s;equences of being too warm in an argument.&mdash;Find the wi&s;e&s;t men are &s;ubject to particular weak|ne&s;&s;es.&mdash;Meet with a poet.&mdash;He delivers an opinion not much to the credit of hu|man nature.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN I had purcha&s;ed the arti|cles of dre&s;s that I &s;tood in need of, I inquired the neare&s;t way to We&s;t|min&s;ter,
<PB N="6" REF="4">
where my late ma&s;ter's friend, the lieutenant, lived, to whom I had a letter of recommendation; and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of various per&s;ons, who were kind enough to &s;hew me the way, I made a &s;ort of a zig-zag movement to|wards the place of de&s;tination. But, unfortunately for me, when I came there I heard that the gentleman was gone in the country but the day before; and an old woman, who was left as the guar|dian dragon of his furniture in his ab|&s;ence, informed me, for my comfort, that &s;he did not expect him to return to town for at lea&s;t two months. This in|telligence was another thunderbolt of fate that drove me &s;till nearer to the cave of de&s;pair; however, wi&s;hing her a good morning, I a&s;&s;umed new cou|rage, and re&s;olved to keep up my &s;pi|rits
<PB N="7" REF="5">
as well as I could, not doubting but that I &s;hould &s;hortly arrive at the end of all my inquietude.</P>
<P>Buoyed up by this idea, I continued whi&s;tling an old tune till I found my&s;elf at a gate, which led into a row of trees, and this place, on inquiry, I found to be St. James's Park. When I had &s;aun|tered about a con&s;iderable time, I &s;at down on one of the benches in the Mall, and continued there for &s;ome minutes in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, with my hands in my breeches-pockets, and my head re|clined again&s;t a tree. I was exactly in this po&s;ition, when an odd &s;ort of a fi|gure came and &s;at down on the &s;ame &s;eat. He was a tall, athletic, man, with a black vi&s;age, thick lips, and rather meanly attired; but, notwith&s;tanding which, there was an air of politene&s;s in
<PB N="8" REF="6">
his demeanour, and &s;uch marks of phi|lanthropy in his countenance, that he attracted my re&s;pect by a &s;ort of invo|luntary impul&s;e.</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely &s;at down three mi|nutes before he entered into conver&s;a|tion with me, by a&s;king with a &s;mile, which &s;eemed equally to partake of good-humour and concern, <Q>What makes you look &s;o &s;erious, my lad?</Q> I told him, with a low bow, that I was not well.&mdash;"I am &s;orry for it," &s;aid the &s;tranger; <Q>but tell me now, without di&s;gui&s;e, is the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ituated in your body or your mind?</Q>&mdash;I an&s;wered him, with a deep &s;igh, that it lay in|tirely in my mind.&mdash;"Does it?" replied he, <Q>well, my lad, I'll be your phy&s;i|cian on this occa&s;ion; but, contrary to the general rules of practice, I &s;hall
<PB N="9" REF="7">
admini&s;ter without a fee, and my me|dicines, though &s;alutary, are not ex|pen&s;ive.&mdash;But, fir&s;t, tell me what re|ligion you profe&s;s, for I perceive, by your tongue, that you are a native of Ireland.</Q> When I informed him that I was educated agreeably to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of that country, he took my hand with &s;eeming rapture, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, very warmly, my friend; then, taking a little book out of his pocket, he pre&s;ented it to me with the&s;e words:&mdash;<Q>I give you this, my young friend," &s;aid he, "to learn by heart, which I conjure you to do im|mediately:&mdash;you will find it contain &s;ome prayers that you mu&s;t repeat in the cour&s;e of the day, according to the order in which they are &s;et down. Do that, and pray to God to ble&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="8">
you, and depend upon it all will go well. For, the evils we experience in this life originate from two cau&s;es; the fir&s;t is, by neglecting our daily wor&s;hip of the Almighty; and the &s;econd is, by not knowing our&s;elves; for, if we knew our&s;elves, my young friend, we &s;hould have no occa&s;ion for the rigorous exerci&s;e of tho&s;e &s;e|verities, which the wi&s;dom of men finds it nece&s;&s;ary to put in force for the well-being of each other; but, lo&s;ing &s;ight of tho&s;e great beacons of our felicity, we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be driven about by the tempe&s;t of our pa&s;|&s;ions, until we are eventually lo&s;t for ever.&mdash;I hope, my lad," continues he, "that my advice has made a proper impre&s;&s;ion upon your heart: &mdash; you
<PB N="11" REF="9">
look like a good-natured young man, and I dare take upon me to a&s;&s;ert that you will profit by my in&s;truc|tions.</Q></P>
<P>The impo&s;ition of the pious pedlar, of whom mention is made in the former part of this hi&s;tory, was &s;till &s;o fre&s;h in my recollection, that I could &s;carcely mu&s;ter up words enough to tell him that I was obliged to him: (&s;o much do the ac|tions of the unworthy part of human nature place us on our guard again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ions of the be&s;t:) however, I pro|mi&s;ed him to read his book with atten|tion, which plea&s;ed him &s;o much, that, &s;eizing the button of my coat, he began to give me a &s;hort hi&s;tory of his life, in which I was informed, that he was a major in the army, on half-pay; and
<PB N="12" REF="10">
that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of his life was to &s;uccour the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and take &s;uch poor wretches under his protection, as, from their poverty, or other cau&s;es, were de|prived of every temporal comfort, and obliged to &s;eek for happine&s;s in the con|templation of eternity.</P>
<P>He was proceeding to give me the hi&s;tory of a poor woman he had been to &s;ee that very morning, who had been deprived of her &s;en&s;es as well as pro|perty by the villany of an attorney, when the narrative was interrupted by a gentleman, who tapped the major on the &s;houlder with great familiarity; and, placing him&s;elf on the bench, they en|tered into mutual inquiries about their private affairs, to my great joy and &s;a|tisfaction: for I &s;hould have remarked, that the military reformer of manners
<PB N="13" REF="11">
laboured under exactly the &s;ame impe|diment, in point of delivery, as the ce|lebrated Demo&s;thenes, and was obliged to depo&s;it three or four large &s;tones in his mouth before he could make him&s;elf under&s;tood; and the good man, in the mid&s;t of his zeal for my happine&s;s, talk|ed &s;o fa&s;t and &s;o vehemently, that the &s;tones dropped one by one out of his mouth, unperceived, and he was actually reduced to a dependence on a &s;ingle pebble for his powers of elocution when the per&s;on beforementioned came to my relief. And, indeed, that circum&s;tance was particularly fortunate to me; for the major had fir&s;t griped fa&s;t hold of my button, to prevent my e&s;cape from his admonitions, (which, though very pious, were not extremely plea&s;ant,) and then he put his mouth clo&s;e to my
<PB N="14" REF="12">
face, and &s;o be&s;pattered me with &s;pittle, that, before he would have got half through his &s;tory, I probably &s;hould not have had an eye left, or been able to have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed an object at a yard di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But my attention was now engaged by a &s;evere conflict between the major and his acquaintance, which I could per|ceive derived its &s;ource from a difference in political principles; the major being a &s;trenuous advocate for the privileges of the people, and the other equally as violent for the prerogative of maje&s;ty. In the cour&s;e of this debate I was &s;ome|what concerned to find the major lo&s;e &s;ight of that equanimity of di&s;po&s;ition, which I imagined was the natural con|comitant of a mind &s;o well regulated as his. After a few polite bickerings they both left their &s;eats in great perturba|tion,
<PB N="15" REF="13">
and walked up the Mall, to fini&s;h and adju&s;t their political di&s;putation.</P>
<P>They had &s;carcely left the bench, when the vacancy was filled by a mea|gre, thin, man, in a thread-bare black coat, who approached with one hand depo&s;ited in his bo&s;om, and the other in his wai&s;tcoat-pocket. He wore a &s;mall hat, which partly covered a tie-wig with|out powder, that &s;eemed, by the appear|ance of the caul in various places, to have &s;een almo&s;t as many days as its ma&s;ter. He wore likewi&s;e a black &s;tock, which, by the careful manner in which he had buttoned his coat to the top, gave me &s;trong &s;u&s;picion to imagine, that, from a rigid principle of either prudence or poverty, he made it an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of a &s;hirt; for I could not trace the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of that ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="16" REF="14">
appendage of a man's dre&s;s through any of tho&s;e apertures which the iron hand of time had made in his &s;uit of &s;able.&mdash;His beard was at once gri&s;tly and grey, and appeared to have been unmole&s;ted by the razor for at lea&s;t a week; which, added to the pale a&s;|pect of his weather-beaten face, made him altogether no indifferent repre&s;en|tation of the figure of famine. When he had taken his &s;eat, he &s;eemed to re|tire within him&s;elf with a &s;ort of &s;ullen dignity, and bore a kind of <HI>noli-me-tan|gere</HI> on his forehead, that tacitly for|bade all human communication.</P>
<P>I don't know exactly to what motive to attribute it, but, certainly, I never felt a &s;tronger curio&s;ity take place in my brea&s;t than did at that time to know the hi&s;tory of this &s;eeming original. Thrice
<PB N="17" REF="15">
I made advances to &s;peak to him, but was as often in&s;tantly frozen by the un|charitable contraction of his mu&s;cles. At length an occa&s;ion offered of doing him an incon&s;iderable &s;ervice, which I did not &s;uffer to pa&s;s unheeded.&mdash;I ob|&s;erved that he had taken a &s;mall bundle of papers from his bo&s;om, which he looked at for &s;ome time with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, till a &s;ilent tear, &s;tealing from his eye, &s;ullied his manly cheek; but, eager to wipe away &s;o frail a te&s;timony of his weakne&s;s, he felt in his pocket, with great trepidation, for a handker|chief, and, in his hurry, dropped tho&s;e papers, which had moved him to &s;o public and expre&s;&s;ive an indication of his &s;orrow and chagrin. I immediately leaped from my &s;eat, and, taking up the bundle, delivered it to him with all
<PB N="18" REF="16">
that delicacy of addre&s;s and tenderne&s;s of manner, which &s;hould ever accom|pany our actions, when we mean to pour the balm of con&s;olation into the wounds of the unfortunate. He &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the re&s;pect I paid him, and, gently bowing towards me, &s;o far de&s;cended from the maje&s;ty of genius as to offer me a pinch of &s;nuff, from a paltry iron box, as a recompence for my civility, which I accepted with rapture as an overture of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>After a few mutual inquiries, the un|der&s;trapper of Apollo opened his cir|cum&s;tances as follows.&mdash;"I am," &s;aid the wretched man, <Q>a poor, but faith|ful, &s;ervant of the Mu&s;es, and have been wandering about the plains of Parna&s;&s;us for the la&s;t thirty years of my life, gathering laurels to adorn
<PB N="19" REF="17">
my tomb, but have found the journey &s;o painful, and the profit &s;o &s;canty, that, had I known the inconveniences before I &s;et forward in the pur&s;uit, I &s;hould &s;carcely have had the hardi|ne&s;s to encounter &s;uch complicated perils of fatigue to have acquired the reputation even of a Homer.</Q></P>
<P>Emboldened by this free declaration on the part of the poet, I told him, that I pre&s;umed tho&s;e papers, which he held in his hand, were &s;ome children of his brain, that he doubtle&s;s meant to favour the world with in due time.&mdash;"Ah!" replied this literary veteran, <Q>you gue&s;s right as to my intention, I do mean to publi&s;h them; but of what im|portance is the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t brilliant talents, if you want friends to bring you into reputation?&mdash;you
<PB N="20" REF="18">
may peri&s;h in a garret with the abi|lities of an Otway.</Q>&mdash;I told him, that I always conceived a work of merit would &s;ufficiently recommend it&s;elf.&mdash; <Q>Aye, my dear friend," &s;ays the bard, that ob&s;ervation proves you to be a very young man indeed; when you have acquired a little more expe|rience, you will &s;ee, that, in nine in|&s;tances out of ten, the retinue of folly overcome the inheritors of genius. If a noble lord, or a great man, has a fool in the family, who wi&s;hes to be celebrated as a wit, it follows, as naturally as the night &s;ucceeds the day, that he mu&s;t be &s;upported in his preten&s;ions at the expence of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice:&mdash;it matters not how ab|&s;urd his productions may be, he will always find the pen of venality ready
<PB N="21" REF="19">
to aggrandize his fame.</Q>&mdash;Here I ventured to interrupt his harangue by ob&s;erving, that I thought be&s;towing of prai&s;e upon performances, that were un|de&s;erving, only &s;erved to heighten their deformity by making them more con|&s;picuous, as dre&s;&s;ing a cripple in finery &s;erved but to render him the more re|markably ridiculous.&mdash;<Q>That ob&s;erva|tion will hold good," &s;ays my com|panion, "in almo&s;t every other human concern but that of public writing; for, in that particular province, where individuals, indeed, &s;hould be mo&s;t tenacious of their rea&s;on, they are lea&s;t &s;o, and tamely re&s;ign their judgement, upon the literary e&s;&s;ays of the times, to news-paper editors and reviewers of periodical publications; who, independent of the facility with
<PB N="22" REF="20">
which they are corrupted, are, in ge|neral, as little capable of di&s;covering the beauties of a work (and very often much le&s;s &s;o) as the herd of a&s;&s;es who li&s;ten to their determina|tions.</Q></P>
<P>By the&s;e &s;arca&s;tic opinions, I naturally conjectured that my new friend had re|cently undergone the flagellations of critici&s;m; but, as the a&s;&s;everations of the author opened a new field of know|ledge to my view, I re&s;olved to culti|vate his acquaintance with all the in|du&s;try in my power.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The poet and I re&s;olve to dine together.&mdash; Poor encouragement for authors.&mdash;Dive for a dinner.&mdash;The poets refectory.&mdash; A proof of their antipathy to a certain profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Every mouth open, but none &s;atisfied.&mdash;An unfortunate circum&s;tance. &mdash;The comforts of a thick head.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I OBSERVED a kind of ingenuous &s;hame hang about the poet, which it was evident aro&s;e from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his poverty; and it, doubtle&s;s, would have depre&s;&s;ed him much more, if the lofty ideas I perceived he entertained of his own abilities, as an author, did not &s;tep in to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and counteract,
<PB N="24" REF="22">
by the ambition they &s;ugge&s;ted to his imagination, all the &s;lights he might hourly receive, from the gro&s;s bulk of mankind, on the &s;core of his wretched|ne&s;s and want of money.</P>
<P>As we walked through the park, in an inattentive moment I a&s;ked my com|panion where he propo&s;ed to dine that day; to which que&s;tion he replied, with a &s;ignificant look, that bore &s;trongly the tokens of &s;urpri&s;e. Afraid le&s;t I had committed &s;ome gro&s;s impropriety, my cheeks reddened with a deep &s;uffu&s;ion of &s;carlet, and I remained &s;ilent; when the poet, reading the &s;tate of my thoughts, relieved me from my embar|ra&s;&s;ment, by voluntarily informing me, that there was a hou&s;e, not very far di&s;|tant, at which he u&s;ually &s;atisfied the
<PB N="25" REF="23">
craving demands of nature, unle&s;s he was engaged abroad, which, he ob&s;er|ved, happened but &s;eldom; and, if I were inclined to accompany him, that I &s;hould be exceedingly welcome to a &s;hare of his porridge.&mdash;"It is true," &s;ays he, <Q>we poor fellows, who have the misfortune to labour under that mo&s;t incurable of all di&s;ea&s;es, the <HI>cacoethes &s;cribendi,</HI> have &s;eldom an opportunity of ta&s;ting tho&s;e elegan|cies, who&s;e delicious flavours render life &s;o de&s;irable to the animal part of humanity;&mdash;no," continued this mi|&s;erable child of the Mu&s;es, "we are frequently obliged to walk over the thorny path of di&s;tre&s;s, and wa&s;te our exi&s;tence in the vale of mi|&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="24">Here he ended his remark with a deep-fetched &s;igh, at the &s;ame time clap|ping his hand, as it were by in&s;tinct, to his pur&s;e;&mdash;a combination of events that very plainly evinced the weakne&s;s of his finances; for, however poets may be elevated above the common cla&s;&s;es of human nature in their ideas, I find the vi&s;itations of mi&s;ery can make them me|lancholy as well as other men.</P>
<P>In our way to the place of entertain|ment, the little author diverted me with various anecdotes of the per&s;ons, in who&s;e company we might, in all pro|bability, dine; and, if his penciling was to be depended upon, as conveying the outlines of truth, a mo&s;t egregious &s;et of beings they were.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="25">At la&s;t, after innumerable turnings and windings through by-&s;treets and filthy alleys, I was given to under&s;tand, by my conductor, that we had come to the wi&s;hed-for port; and I was looking with prodigious indu&s;try, but in vain, for a &s;ight of &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of good living, which hung pendant from the windows of the hou&s;e I had been introduced to the day before; and I be|gan then to imagine that the poet was out in his reckoning, or, in plain Eng|li&s;h, had mi&s;taken his way; when he removed my &s;cruples by hailing me from a neighbouring cellar, into which he was de&s;cending with great precipita|tion, and had already got &s;o far, that nothing but his head remained above the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26">I followed him into this &s;ubterranean cavern with infinite caution on my part, which was was very nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve; for, though the poet, from long prac|tice, could have run down them on a pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, yet a &s;tranger mu&s;t have found the de&s;cent to be no ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age, as &s;everal of the &s;tairs were wanting, and one fal&s;e &s;tep might have been as detrimental to the &s;afety of his per&s;on as it is generally found to the re|putation of a fair lady: but, thanks to my prudence, I landed &s;afe in this re|treat of genius; for &s;uch it might be called from the characters of the per&s;ons who retired there to eat in &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The appearance of the place altoge|ther was &s;o unlike what I had ever &s;een before, that, had I been conveyed thi|ther in a &s;leep, I &s;hould have had no
<PB N="29" REF="27">
doubts, on my awaking, of being an inhabitant of the other world.&mdash;All the light we were favoured with proceeded from the glimmering of two dirty lamps, which only &s;erved, as Milton has ob|&s;erved, to make darkne&s;s more vi&s;i|ble; and, by the aid of which, I could ju&s;t di&s;cern a table, at one end of the apartment, where the poet, taking me by the hand, introduced me as his par|ticular friend, and a man of genius.</P>
<P>Before the dinner was &s;erved up, a &s;ort of general conver&s;ation took place, in the cour&s;e of which a human figure, who &s;at at one corner of the table, (whom I took for an author, for he was &s;till thinner, if po&s;&s;ible, than my com|panion,) acco&s;ted my friend with "Well, Mr. Crambo, have you heard the me|lancholy news this morning?" &mdash;
<PB N="30" REF="28">
No," replies the diminutive poet, Lord ble&s;s me! what's that?" &mdash; Only your competitor Balderda&s;h in limbo! &mdash; that's all," adds the other. &mdash;"I'm &s;orry for it," &s;ays my friend, &s;hrugging his &s;houlders, "but 'tis what we mu&s;t all come to."&mdash;"Aye, it was a damned unlucky accident for poor Frederic," cries another, "for he had been appointed, that very morning, editor to the Scandalous Chronicle."&mdash;"That was a damned &s;troke of fate, indeed," &s;ays a fourth; pray," continued he, "is it a fair que&s;tion, Mr. Slang, to a&s;k the &s;um he is nabbed for?"&mdash;"Oh! certain|ly," replies the other, "'tis thirteen pounds and upwards."&mdash;"Zounds! that's a &s;um indeed!" exclaims ano|ther, "but, perhaps, it could be &s;et|tled;&mdash;as
<PB N="31" REF="29">
our friend is known to be &s;eedy, the creditor might be per&s;ua|ded to compound for half the debt on good &s;ecurity."&mdash;"No," rejoins another, "that's impo&s;&s;ible; for his cre|ditor is as inexorable as Dick Flint, the bailiff."&mdash;"Why, then, he hasn't the proper feelings of a man," cries my friend.&mdash;"Oh! damme, we know that," replies the other, "but the be&s;t of the joke is, he is not a man." &mdash;"Not a man!" exclaims the poet in amazement, "why, what the devil is he then?" &mdash; "Why, if you mu&s;t know, he's a tailor," &s;ays the other.&mdash; Oh! damn the tailors," echoed in|&s;tantly, and at the &s;ame moment, from every mouth in the cavern but mine; from which circum&s;tance I naturally
<PB N="32" REF="30">
concluded there was a little antipathy exi&s;ting between the two profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that &s;ubject was now po&s;tponed by a &s;ummons from the cook, who gave an additional edge to their appetites by the following polite exordium: &mdash; "Come, gemmen," &s;ays the lu&s;ty ho&s;t, <Q>get ready, for I &s;hall &s;oon be with you.&mdash;Damme, here's a di&s;h fit for his maje&s;ty, God ble&s;s him. &mdash;You may &s;ay what you plea&s;e, gem|men, about your Helli&s;hogabalus, but I'll be cur&s;t if he ever &s;at down to &s;oup like this.&mdash;Marrow and fat, my blades!&mdash;I have bought you the be&s;t meat in the market, and here it is, my ma&s;ters, &s;wimming in an ocean of &s;oup, like a fleet at Spithead.&mdash; This will do your hearts good, my boys!&mdash;'tis no wi&s;hy-wa&s;hy &s;tuff, &s;uch
<PB N="33" REF="31">

<P>At the end of this polite and per&s;ua|&s;ive harangue, he took up a large earth|en di&s;h, which &s;moked like a furnace or the tremendous crater of Mount Ve|&s;uvius, and, bending under it, came waddling towards the table; but, whe|ther
<PB N="34" REF="32">
it was his over-eagerne&s;s to accom|modate his half-fami&s;hed gue&s;ts, or that the heat of the di&s;h burnt him &s;o much that he could not hold it any longer, I will not take upon me to determine; but he certainly was too precipitate in the affair; for, not looking rightly be|fore him, and the place being exceed|ingly dark, in&s;tead of placing the &s;mo|king viands immediately in the center of the table, he clapt it down with &s;uch violence on the &s;cull of a tragic poet, who lay &s;leeping on the table, with his head re&s;ting on his hands, as &s;plit the di&s;h into a hundred fragments, to the great annoyance of the whole &s;ociety, who were terribly &s;calded by the &s;oup, which was &s;pla&s;hed around the table in copious &s;treams, like the bur&s;ting of a water-&s;pout, or the falls of Niagara.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="33">As for the lethargic &s;ervant of Mel|pomene, it was generally thought, that, &s;o far from being able to honour any more of his friends, by writing dying &s;peeches to immortalize their memory, he would behold the &s;weet face of the &s;un no more, or, in other language, that his &s;cull was fractured pa&s;t relief. But, in that conjecture, his brethren of the quill were fortunately deceived; for, when a neighbouring &s;urgeon was &s;ent for to examine the contu&s;ion, he gave them the &s;atisfaction of knowing that their friend's wound was very incon&s;i|derable; and likewi&s;e added, to their manife&s;t comfort, that if a ton weight had fallen upon the poet's <HI>cranium,</HI> in|&s;tead of an earthen di&s;h, it would not have done his faculties the &s;malle&s;t in|jury, as nature had furni&s;hed him with a

particular thickne&s;s of bone in that part, that ab&s;olutely bade defiance to ac|cident for its demolition.</P>
<P>As this unlucky affair had de&s;troyed the hopes of the company, relative to the engagement of a hot dinner, they were obliged to call their philo&s;ophy to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, (a lady to whom they were frequently obliged to be indebted in &s;pite of their teeth,) and &s;it down to the mi&s;erable and cold remains of &s;ome ox-cheek and neck of beef, which they pre&s;ently devoured with &s;uch &s;peed as made me imagine, that a thou&s;and &s;uch men in a country would cau&s;e a general famine.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Crambo and I take a walk.&mdash;Agree to &s;ee a play.&mdash;A vi&s;it to a fir&s;t-rate come|dian.&mdash;He is jocular at the expence of the poet.&mdash;Strong doubts of Crambo's &s;anity of mind.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER di&s;charging the reckoning in the cellar, my friend Crambo and I propo&s;ed taking a &s;aunter into the fields; and, during our ramble, he a&s;k|ed me if I were willing to go to the play that evening. Upon my replying in the affirmative, and ob&s;erving, that I could not indulge that propen&s;ity at pre&s;ent, on account of the expence, he bade me make my&s;elf ea&s;y on that par|ticular, as he knew one of the principal
<PB N="39" REF="39">
comedians, for whom he con&s;tantly wrote puffs, and propo&s;ed that I &s;hould call upon him with a note, which, if he were at home, he &s;aid he would certain|ly honour; at the &s;ame time remarking, that he was &s;orry to give me &s;o much trouble, but would have called him&s;elf on the actor, if he had not lodged, un|fortunately, next door to a vile caitiff of a tailor, who had his name upon the debtor-&s;ide of his ledger for a greater &s;um than he found it convenient, or in|deed even po&s;&s;ible, to pay.</P>
<P>Being naturally fond of &s;uch exhibi|tions, I greedily &s;eized &s;o favourable an opportunity of &s;eeing a play on the Lon|don &s;tage, imagining that to be the very fountain-head of dramatic excellence; and, going into the fir&s;t public hou&s;e we came to, the poet wrote a note,
<PB N="40" REF="40">
which he &s;ealed up, and &s;ent by me to the player, re&s;olving to wait for my re|turn at the alehou&s;e, and &s;olace him&s;elf with the comforts of a quid of tobacco, a pennyworth of porter, and a belly-full of reflexion.</P>
<P>Rapt in idea with the plea&s;ures which were to accrue from this commi&s;&s;ion, I hurried to the actor's hou&s;e with all the ha&s;te imaginable, and, knocking at the door of his augu&s;t man&s;ion, it was open|ed by a &s;ervant, in rich livery, who ap|peared as much pampered with the good things of this world as an archbi&s;hop; but, before he would conde&s;cend to an|&s;wer me the plain que&s;tion, whether his ma&s;ter was at home or not, &s;urveyed me from head to foot with a look of the mo&s;t mortifying contempt, and then an&s;wered, with a &s;upercilious &s;mile,&mdash;
<PB N="41" REF="41">
<Q>Well, if he be, what the devil can you po&s;&s;ibly want with him?</Q>&mdash;I was &s;o provoked with the fellow's manner and incivility, that I had a great inclination to knock him down; but, repre&s;&s;ing my choler as well as I could, told him, with &s;ome heat of re&s;entment, that I came with a note from Mr. Crambo.&mdash; <Q>What, Crambo, the poet?" &s;ays the fellow, with a &s;neer, "well, I'll take it in, but I'm cur&s;edly afraid, my friend, that you'll go without your errand; for, to my knowledge, my ma&s;ter hasn't any ca&s;h to &s;pare at pre&s;ent;&mdash; he has had a bad run at hazard late|ly, and been tricked mo&s;t infernally; &mdash;he is left without a &s;ingle guinea, and as poor as a minority-member:</Q> then he walked lei&s;urely up &s;tairs, after
<PB N="42" REF="42">
bidding me wait in the hall till his re|turn.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations of the imper|tinent footman, upon the &s;tate of his ma&s;ter's pur&s;e, I conjectured that my a&s;&s;ociate, Crambo, had applied to him, upon occa&s;ion, for other favours, infi|nitely more &s;ub&s;tantial, egad, than or|ders.</P>
<P>After I had &s;tood cooling my heels in the hall for above twenty minutes, the jackanapes in livery returned with a me&s;&s;age from Mr. Bu&s;kin, his ma&s;ter, de&s;iring me to walk up. I obeyed the mandate of the actor; and, following the footman up an elegant &s;tair-ca&s;e, I was &s;hewn into a &s;uperb room, deco|rated with Titian's Loves of the Gods, and a couple of bawdy paintings, (which my friend Crambo a&s;&s;ured me afterwards
<PB N="43" REF="43">
were the performance of a clergyman, and pre&s;ented to the player as a mark of his particular e&s;teem,) I found Mr. Bu&s;kin &s;itting at a table, like his re|doubted highne&s;s the Great Mogul, de|moli&s;hing a gallon of claret with two pro&s;titutes of high <HI>ton,</HI> and a noted bai|liff from Lincoln's-Inn, who had con|&s;cientiou&s;ly lent him fifty guineas that morning, in hard &s;pecie, upon his &s;im|ple bond and judgement, for a hundred, to be paid in &s;ix months, and the ca&s;h was di&s;played with great o&s;tentation be|fore him. &mdash; Turning to me with a contemptuous &s;neer, this con&s;equential, &s;elf-&s;woln, comedian, inquired, in an authoritative tone of voice, if I was the per&s;on who brought the note from old Crambo. I an&s;wered, "Yes, &s;ir," with a bow down to the very carpet; which,
<PB N="44" REF="44">
by the by, I might as well have &s;pared my&s;elf the trouble of performing, as this haughty &s;tage hero did not &s;toop from his dignity &s;o much as to ob&s;erve even the humility of &s;o poor a being as my&s;elf.&mdash;"Well," &s;ays the actor, having read the note, <Q>I don't know what to &s;ay to this bu&s;ine&s;s; this Crambo is a cur&s;ed trouble&s;ome &s;ort of a fellow;&mdash; cur&s;e me," &s;ays the player, "but it would be an act of charity to confine him in a dark room, with clean &s;traw, for a year or two."&mdash;"Who is he?</Q> &s;aid one of the ladies.&mdash;"Who is he!" replied the king of &s;hreds and patches, with a half-&s;tifled laugh, "why, dam|me, he is an author, and more plague to me than a third-day ague;&mdash;the animal is continually levying contri|butions upon my pur&s;e, and, if I re|fu&s;e

him the &s;upplies, I am &s;ure to feel his &s;ting the next day in &s;ome of the daily papers, where he ince&s;&s;antly &s;cribbles, with as little regard to truth in his writing as he has to decency in his manners."&mdash;"Why d'ye indulge him in his beggarly reque&s;ts?" re|joins the other lady.&mdash;"For the be&s;t rea&s;on in the world to an actor," cries the player, "becau&s;e I'm afraid of him, you &s;trap of Beelzebub; &s;o I'm obliged to throw a &s;op to Cerberus now and then, to &s;top his growling; though, damme, I've often a great inclination to &s;trangle the old dog, and get rid of him that way," continues the &s;ce|nic chief, "by anticipating the conclu|&s;ion of public ju&s;tice."</P>

on its &s;ub&s;iding, the tender limb of the law, who flanked the left &s;ide of the co|median, exclaimed vociferou&s;ly, <Q>B&mdash;&s;t me, Ma&s;ter Bu&s;kin, why don't you do him over?&mdash;&s;wear to any thing above ten pounds, and I'm your man;&mdash;by the Lord I'll muzzle the thief of the world in four and twenty hours;&mdash; &s;ay 'tis a match, and the thing's done, d'ye &s;ee me; &s;o enough &s;aid.</Q> But, whether the actor really held the phi|lanthropic advice of his bo&s;om-friend in abhorrence, or that he was afraid of the con&s;equences, I cannot tell; yet certain it is, that he cho&s;e to turn a deaf ear to the charitable remon&s;trance of his com|panion at that period; and, calling for pen, ink, and paper, immediately wrote an order for two to the pit, which he delivered to me with as much maje&s;ty as
<PB N="47" REF="49">
if he had been in the act of per&s;onating the eighth Harry.</P>
<P>As I had &s;ucceeded &s;o well in my ne|gotiation, I &s;aluted the mimic hero with the greate&s;t marks of re&s;pect, in the per|formance of which he was plea&s;ed to eye me with a kind of merry di&s;dain; and, at la&s;t bur&s;ting forth into an immoderate fit of laughter, roared out, <Q>Damme, what, I &s;uppo&s;e you're a young poet too, an't you?</Q> I in&s;tantly replied, "No, &s;ir," with evident marks of con|fu&s;ion. &mdash; "Well, well," replied the mangler of heroics, <Q>I a&s;k your pardon mo&s;t &s;incerely for the &s;u&s;picion; I &s;hould have &s;een at fir&s;t &s;ight that you're too &s;leek and well dre&s;&s;ed to drink the waters of Helicon, and, if you are not damnably dry indeed, my hone&s;t fellow," continues the actor,
<PB N="48" REF="50">
you never &s;hould: &mdash; take my word for it, 'tis a cur&s;ed dirty puddle, and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, may be compared to bad gin; for, though it frequently intoxicates the ragged part of my a&s;|&s;ociates, may I be hi&s;&s;ed the next time I immortalize Diony&s;ius if it ever fattened a &s;ingle &s;coundrel of them all.</Q></P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this &s;alutary ad|monition, one of the demireps politely ob&s;erved, that &s;he wondered Mr. Bu&s;|kin &s;hould wa&s;te his time, talking about &s;uch &s;habby dogs. To which elegant ob&s;ervation the player thought proper to reply, that, though he admitted the rhyme-weaving ra&s;cals were contempti|ble as men, "yet," &s;ays the &s;on of Mel|pomene, <Q>they are to be dreaded as enemies, and, in &s;ome &s;ort, are a
<PB N="49" REF="51">
kind of nece&s;&s;ary appendage to the character of an actor, and an&s;wer much the &s;ame purpo&s;e to us as a candle&s;tick does to a taper; for, though," continued Mr. Bu&s;kin, they haven't the power to increa&s;e our innate flame of merit, yet we find it damned difficult to &s;tand upright without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance:&mdash;&s;o, mind, my friend," &s;ays the player, turning to me, "give my re&s;pectful compliments to my worthy friend Mr. Crambo, and tell him not to forget me in the next critique he writes for the &s;tage; for he knows that I both re&s;pect, ad|mire, and regard, him," cries the in|&s;olent mummer, "as the devil does holy water,</Q> turning his head to the bailiff, who &s;at in full enjoyment of the fun, with his tongue thru&s;t in his
<PB N="50" REF="52">
left cheek, by the way of a tacit com|ment on the player's &s;incerity. &mdash; The actor, giving me a nod that &s;eemed to &s;ay I might depart when I thought pro|per, I &s;aluted the re&s;pectable group, and in&s;tantly left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On the way back to my companion, I could not avoid reflecting on the &s;ingular behaviour of the comedian:&mdash;fir&s;t, on the long and tedious interval that I pa&s;&s;ed in his hall, which was an intolerable &s;a|crifice, I under&s;tood afterwards, he made every poor devil pay to his vanity, who&s;e quality, or &s;uppo&s;ed rank in life, did not elevate him &s;ufficiently to be treated as his equal: &mdash; &s;econdly, the wanton freedom and uncharitable im|pertinence with which he &s;poke of poor Crambo, who, from his education as well as his heart, could properly claim
<PB N="51" REF="53">
an infinite pre-eminence, over this up|&s;tart ranter of heroics, in the grand &s;cale of &s;ociety:&mdash;and, la&s;tly, at the general contempt he threw upon authors, of all de&s;criptions, by his illiberal remarks upon my dre&s;s and condition; when he &s;hould have retreated within his own mind, and been thankful to Fortune for his &s;ituation, which lifted him above the experience of tho&s;e calamities that are hourly endured by men of the mo&s;t &s;ub|lime merit, virtue, and &s;en&s;ibility, and who&s;e caprice of di&s;po&s;ition could not be better, or more &s;trongly, evinced, than by her ridiculous di&s;pen&s;ations in favour of &s;o worthle&s;s an individual.</P>
<P>When I came to the rendezvous, I found my friend Crambo &s;itting with his pot before him, writing with a pencil in a book, which I learned afterwards
<PB N="52" REF="54">
he carried about with him, to enter &s;uch thoughts as aro&s;e in his imagination, and which he imagined worth a record. As I perceived that he was deeply im|merged in thought, I was re&s;olved not to di&s;turb his ideas, but to remain where I was until he &s;hould be di&s;engaged, and de&s;cend, like another mortal, to intere&s;t him&s;elf in the affairs of this &s;ublunary world.</P>
<P>During this interval, the woman of the hou&s;e came out of the bar, and de&s;ired me to take my companion away as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, for &s;he did not choo&s;e to harbour madmen in her hou&s;e. When I te&s;tified my &s;urprize at this &s;trange account of my friend's intellects, &s;he told me, that, &s;ince I left him, he had &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and, running about the room with a book in his hand,
<PB N="53" REF="55">
made &s;uch a noi&s;e, and uttered &s;uch un|intelligible jargon, as frightened two fi&s;h-women and a ticket-porter, who were drinking brandy in the &s;ame box. And &s;he farther informed me, that &s;he had &s;ent to a mad doctor's, who lived within a few doors, for a &s;traight wai&s;t|coat, to confine him, but, unfortunate|ly, the phy&s;ician had left home about an hour before, on a vi&s;it to a celebrated lady, who had gone out of her mind on the death of a favourite lap-dog.&mdash; Here I thought proper to remove the poor woman's apprehen&s;ions by inform|ing her, that Mr. Crambo was a poet, and that what &s;he took for incoherent ravings, was probably only the recital of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of a new poem which he had been conceiving;&mdash;that I would an&s;wer for it he was a very harmle&s;s
<PB N="54" REF="56">
character, and intreated her to let him remain unmole&s;ted for a few minutes longer, as perhaps di&s;turbing him then might unhinge the be&s;t chain of ideas that were ever forged in the human un|der&s;tanding, and &s;top his progre&s;s in the very moment that he was galloping on his &s;ublime Pega&s;us to the heights of immortality.</P>

<P>Di&s;cover Crambo in a poetical reverie.&mdash; Go to the play.&mdash;My friend and I meet with a di&s;a&s;ter.&mdash;The applau&s;e of an audience not always con&s;onant with rea|&s;on.&mdash;More ways than one of acquiring fame.&mdash;The poet's remarks on the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of the theatres.&mdash;He di&s;putes with a critic, and &s;hews his contempt of modern actors.&mdash;My wi&s;hes are con|&s;trained to be obedient to nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PRESENTLY I ob&s;erved that the poet's eyes began to gli&s;ten; and, my landlady conjuring me to &s;tep on one &s;ide for the love of God, I follow|ed her advice, being willing to &s;ee what turn this affair would take: but my
<PB N="56" REF="58">
friend Crambo did not leave me long in doubt; for, gra&s;ping the pewter pot in one hand, and his common-place book in the other, he &s;trutted about the room, repeating the following lines from Dryden with great energy:
<Q><L>"Happy's the man, and happy he alone,</L>
<L>"He who can call to-day his own;</L>
<L>"He who, &s;ecure within him&s;elf, can &s;ay,</L>
<L>"To-morrow do thy wor&s;t, for I have liv'd to-day;</L>
<L>"Be fair or foul, or rain or &s;hine,</L>
<L>"The joys I have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in &s;pite of fate are mine;</L>
<L>"Not heav'n it&s;elf upon the pa&s;t has pow'r,</L>
<L>"But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour."</L></Q>
At the conclu&s;ion of this elegant quo|tation, the little bard &s;talked acro&s;s the room with the port of an emperor;
<PB N="57" REF="59">
when, running up to him, I took my friend by the hand, and informed him of the &s;ucce&s;s of my emba&s;&s;y, taking care to conceal the di&s;agreeable expre&s;|&s;ions which the player had made u&s;e of &s;o much to Crambo's di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>As the clock &s;truck five, my compa|nion put me in mind that it was time we went to the theatre, if I wi&s;hed to have a good &s;eat, as the piece to be perform|ed that evening was a very attractive di&s;h to the public, and con&s;idered by the million as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing merit, though, for his part, he thought otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Having paid the landlady, who &s;eemed more than commonly rejoiced at my friend's departure, we hurried to the &s;cene of action, and got there ju&s;t time enough to &s;queeze in with the croud, who had been waiting for the doors

opening. The pre&s;&s;ure, on all &s;ides of me, was &s;o great, that I had not the power to make u&s;e of my hands, but was carried forward by the mob, intire|ly at their di&s;po&s;al, like an unnavigated boat in a &s;trong current, and, by the time I had got into the pit, I was al|mo&s;t reduced to the con&s;i&s;tence of a jelly. As for the little poet, he had been more &s;curvily u&s;ed than my&s;elf; for, added to the embraces his ribs had undergone, the outrageous behaviour of the multitude who &s;urrounded him had fairly carried away his hat and wig, and he was obliged to &s;it with his handker|chief tied round his head for the re&s;t of the evening. An orange-woman ac|co&s;ting me to buy &s;ome fruit, I attempt|ed to put my hand in my pocket, when, alas! I found they were turned in&s;ide
<PB N="59" REF="61">
out, and I was robbed of every &s;hilling that my rigid oeconomy had pre&s;erved out of my la&s;t guinea. I communicated this doleful piece of news to my neigh|bour Crambo, who, after &s;hrugging his &s;houlders a little, and pointing to the lo&s;s of his own hat and wig, bade me be comforted.&mdash;"You &s;ee," cries the poet, <Q>how that vixen, Fortune, de|lights in per&s;ecuting us poor devils, and it matters not a whit, if &s;he means to plague the human heart, whether &s;he effects her vile purpo&s;es by the lo&s;s of a pur&s;e or the demolition of an empire; &s;o, my friend," conti|tinued the bard, "e'en let us a&s;&s;ume that equality of temper which makes its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ea&s;y under every diffi|culty, and defeat the malice of the gip&s;y's intentions, by &s;hewing, in our
<PB N="60" REF="62">
conduct, that we de&s;pi&s;e her and all her works:&mdash;the motto of my exi&s;t|ence has been always <HI>nil de&s;perandum,</HI> which, let me tell you, is the be&s;t charm we can make u&s;e of to extir|pate the pre&s;ence of care.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this well-timed ad|dre&s;s of the poet, I could not chace away, for the &s;oul of me, the &s;orrow that I felt for the lo&s;s of my money; I was then almo&s;t dead with fatigue and want of re&s;t;&mdash;the mi&s;eries that I had endured the night before were &s;till warm in my imagination, and the uncertainty of knowing whether I &s;hould, or &s;hould not, have the felicity of paying a &s;alu|tary vi&s;it to Morpheus, on that night, loaded my heart with the mo&s;t inex|pre&s;&s;ible anxiety. But the&s;e fears were pre&s;ently removed by the kindne&s;s of
<PB N="61" REF="63">
the philanthropic author, who gene|rou&s;ly offered me the u&s;e of one half of his bed, until Fate &s;hould enable me to procure one of my own.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation was now interrupted by the ringing of a bell behind the cur|tain, which I under&s;tood was a &s;ignal that the performance was going to be|gin. When I &s;aw the people &s;it down around me, in preparation, my heart beat high with expectation of the co|ming plea&s;ure, and, at length, the mo|ment of gratification arrived. The cur|tain was drawn up, and a young man, of a genteel a&s;pect, &s;tepped forward to &s;peak the prologue. As I under&s;tood that he was a dramatic novitiate, that had lately made his appearance with particular honour to him&s;elf and advan|tage to the manager, I li&s;tened, with the
<PB N="62" REF="64">
greate&s;t attention, to his manner of de|livery and to the language of the com|po&s;ition, expecting to &s;ee and hear &s;ome|thing, if not immediately perfection, at lea&s;t very near approaching to it. But, in this as well as many other in&s;tances of my life, I was mo&s;t cruelly deceived. As for the language of the compo&s;ition, (notwith&s;tanding I was a&s;&s;ured, by the per&s;ons around me, that it was written by a man of fa&s;hion,) I was convinced it was the mo&s;t ab&s;urd combination of non&s;en&s;e that ever di&s;graced the dra|matic exhibition of a barn; and, as for the actor who &s;poke it, he put me in mind of the Merry-Andrew to an itinerant <HI>char|latan,</HI> by his ge&s;tures, rather than a fir&s;t-rate comedian, who might be pre&s;umed to have &s;ome latent regard for common &s;en&s;e, when &s;trutting away his ridiculous

hour on the boards of &s;o re&s;pectable a theatre; for he &s;kipped and jumped about the &s;tage like a mad dancing-ma&s;ter in one of the wards of Bedlam-Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>When the di&s;gu&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s of pro|logue-&s;peaking was over, the comedian retired; but, in&s;tead of being attend|ed, in his theatric exit, by tho&s;e murmurs of di&s;approbation, which I conceived mu&s;t have always followed &s;o vile a mar|tyrdom of propriety, he was loudly ap|plauded by &s;everal people from the pit and galleries. This extraordinary con|duct in an audience, that I naturally &s;uppo&s;ed enlightened, from the oppor|tunity they had of contra&s;ting real merit with buffoonery, &s;urpri&s;ed me &s;o much, that I a&s;ked Crambo what he thought of their procedure. He &s;miled at my que&s;tion, and told me a &s;ecret, well

worth knowing to all frequenters of theatres, namely, that the plaudits I had &s;o judiciou&s;ly condemned were be|&s;towed by the dependents and hired auxi|liaries of the player in que&s;tion, to &s;ome of whom he gave orders for admi&s;&s;ion, and to others money, to &s;upport him in his earne&s;t and laudable endeavours to ac|quire a great reputation as an actor, at the expence of every thing rational or prai&s;e-worthy.&mdash;<Q>As for the judgement, or rea&s;on, that is &s;uppo&s;ed to predo|minate in a playhou&s;e," &s;ays the poet, I would not give three farthings for their influence; be&s;ides, I dare aver, that the &s;mall portions there may be of either, among the audience of this evening, is confined to a few indivi|duals, who are too proud to enter into a conte&s;t with ignorance, and

too well bred to be violent in their di&s;plea&s;ure; &s;o that, unfortunately for common &s;en&s;e," continues the bard, "folly and pre&s;umption defeat her and all her influence, within the&s;e walls, in nine in&s;tances out of ten.</Q></P>
<P>As the little man got heated, in his remarks upon the pro&s;titution of public prai&s;e, he &s;poke &s;o loud that he was overheard by &s;everal people around us; &s;ome of whom thought his ob&s;ervations very pertinent, and were &s;o well plea&s;ed at the grace and facility with which he delivered them, that they paid him a particular attention during the re&s;t of the entertainment; &s;o much had the beauties of his under&s;tanding overcome the prejudice that was at fir&s;t conceived again&s;t him from his grote&s;que and &s;ingular appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68">At length the play began, and I kept a watchful eye, fir&s;t on the performers and then on the poet, being willing to perceive, by the emotions of his coun|tenance, (which, from his black eyes, heavy brows, and meagre mu&s;cles, was finely calculated for expre&s;&s;ion,) how far his feelings corre&s;ponded with my own. One of the mo&s;t celebrated of the actre&s;&s;es making her appearance, &s;uch a clapping of hands en&s;ued as could not have been exceeded if Thalia her&s;elf had per&s;onated the character; all which &s;he received with a kind of indifferent in|&s;olence of behaviour, as tacitly implied, that &s;he imagined it was doing them a prodigious favour by deigning to appear at all; but, entering into the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;cene, &s;he conducted her dialogue with &s;uch a &s;martne&s;s of delivery as
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;eemed to give general delight; and, at one or two pa&s;&s;ages, where the poet had ari&s;en a &s;mall degree above his u&s;ual dulne&s;s, &s;he got through &s;o well, and did the author &s;uch ju&s;tice, by add|ing to his wit a certain poignancy pe|culiar to her&s;elf, that I ob&s;erved the mu&s;cles of the grim bard (who was lean|ing his chin mo&s;t attentively upon an oaken &s;tick) relaxing with a lazy ten|dency towards a &s;mile of approbation. I was the more plea&s;ed that my friend's iron features were expanded at this happy e&s;&s;ay of the actre&s;s, as her management of the execution had made me extremely well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of the comedy, I heard the bard utter a loud groan, which was an ample te&s;timony to me that he had not been amu&s;ed equal to his wi&s;hes;
<PB N="68" REF="70">
and he was &s;itting in a kind of &s;ullen di&s;content, when a gentleman ob&s;erved, that he had never &s;een a more excellent comedy, nor one better performed. This public a&s;&s;everation was, in the opinion of the poet, too great an in&s;ult to the ta&s;te of the audience to pa&s;s un|noticed; and, ri&s;ing accordingly from his &s;eat, with the importance of a Ci|cero, he challenged the per&s;on, who had pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch an eulogium on the per|formance and performers, to point out where tho&s;e beauties lay, in the con|&s;truction of the piece or the merit of the players, that he had &s;o warmly at|tributed to both.</P>
<P>My friend had &s;carcely thrown the gauntlet of defiance, when a circle was formed, of every one within hearing, to li&s;ten to the critici&s;ms of the author,

his former remarks having excited their attention. Upon my friend's opponent making a few loo&s;e and de&s;ultory at|tempts to defend his a&s;&s;ertion, the little retainer of the mu&s;es an&s;wered him in the following manner.&mdash;"The &s;cience of acting," &s;aid the bard, "is a more difficult undertaking than is generally imagined by the actors them&s;elves, or by tho&s;e weak per&s;ons who arrogate a &s;ufficient &s;hare of judgement to determine on its excellences, when, in reality, they have frequently no requi&s;ite to make them competent to &s;uch a &s;ituation but their pre&s;ump|tion, and no ally to &s;upport &s;o gro&s;s an u&s;urpation of knowledge but their impudence. Many young people, impelled by a ba&s;tard kind of ambi|tion," continued the &s;lave of Par|na&s;&s;us,
<PB N="70" REF="72">
"ru&s;h upon the &s;tage, fooli&s;hly imagining them&s;elves under the gui|dance of the mu&s;es, and pro&s;ecute their intentions with as much indu&s;|try and zeal as tho&s;e hoodwinked wretches, who, from a &s;uppo&s;ed call of the Spirit, run about the confines of the&s;e nations, propagating reli|gious bigotry at the expence of hu|man happine&s;s; yet they are both too often mi&s;taken in the cau&s;e, and, in general, made mi&s;erable by the ef|fect;&mdash;but this is a free country," exclaimed the &s;on of Apollo, with a &s;ig|nificant &s;neer, "and we have, thank heaven, a privilege to be ridiculous whenever we think proper."&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the bard's adver&s;ary &s;topped the progre&s;s of his raillery by a&s;king him, if he did not admit that the pre&s;ent
<PB N="71" REF="73">
actors, taken in general, were equal to tho&s;e he remembered when &s;ome years younger; to which que&s;tion my friend replied, "No," with a &s;trong empha&s;is, and &s;upported his negative by the en|&s;uing remarks.&mdash;<Q>The modern play|ers," &s;aid the poet, "are governed by a momentary caprice, and &s;acrifice the little under&s;tanding they have to plea&s;e the vitiated palate of the pub|lic, without the lea&s;t concern at the outrages they are doing to nature, or the unplea&s;antne&s;s of a labour where their rea&s;on and their efforts mu&s;t be continually at variance. The actors of the old &s;chool, on the contrary, nobly &s;tepped forward in the defence of in&s;ulted wi&s;dom, and re&s;cued the &s;tage from that barbarity, into which it had been gradually &s;inking before

for at lea&s;t half a century: and their exertions did them immortal honour; for they dared to oppo&s;e their judge|ments, as men, again&s;t the ruinous prejudices which a fal&s;e ta&s;te had im|planted in the hearts of their bene|factors. At the head of this reforma|tion &s;tood the late inimitable <HI>Gar|rick,</HI>" vociferated Crambo, "who united as many qualifications for an actor in his mind as the Almighty will perhaps admit a human being to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and the want of which all men of di&s;cernment mu&s;t lament in his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who are &s;eldom correct, but frequently intolerable.&mdash;And who can expect otherwi&s;e," &s;aid the poet, from men who have not a com|mon knowledge of punctuation, or the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that the ge&s;|ture,

voice, and eye, of the per|former &s;hould intimately corre&s;pond in the execution, or that the &s;malle&s;t deficiency, in the conduct of either, renders the repre&s;entation imperfect, in the &s;ame degree as the want of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable feature in the hu|man body will not only take off from the beauty of the whole, but, in &s;ome ca&s;es, make it even repul&s;ive and di&s;|gu&s;ting?</Q></P>
<P>By this time the u&s;ual &s;ummons was given for the commencement of a farce that was to &s;ucceed the comedy, written by the favourite author of the day, which the bard no &s;ooner heard, than, taking me by the arm, he forced me out of the theatre, a&s;&s;erting, that he would rather attend a puppet-&s;how at Bartholomew-Fair than the performance

<P>Arrive at the poet's lodgings.&mdash;An argu|ment that &s;ometimes proves the plea&s;ure of living in a garret.&mdash;An accident oc|curs which terminates in a tragical manner.&mdash;A convincing proof, that fa|tigue is a better opiate than laudanum. &mdash;A ha&s;ty &s;ketch of the furniture of an author's &s;tudy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY friend Crambo not being in a condition to go into a hou&s;e of entertainment, we &s;cudded as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to his lodgings, where we ca&s;t anchor a little before ten o'clock. They were &s;ituated at the bottom of an alley, in St. Giles's, &s;o narrow, that it would not admit two people to walk a-brea&s;t,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
and &s;o long, that I thought we never &s;hould come to the bottom; for there the bard had cho&s;en his re&s;idence, in the garret of a building that had once been a hou&s;e, and who&s;e attic &s;tory leaned for &s;upport again&s;t the man&s;ions on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the alley. He made innumerable apologies to me, as we a&s;cended to his apartment, for ta|king me &s;o high, and told me, that his predilection in favour of a garret intirely aro&s;e from its being more detached from the world than any other room in the hou&s;e, be&s;ides the great advantages it afforded to a mind devoted to &s;tudy and contemplation.</P>
<P>As we had no candle, and the poet was extremely drow&s;y as well as my&s;elf, we agreed to go to bed by moon-light; but, alas! I found, to my co&s;t, when I
<PB N="77" REF="79">
had laid my&s;elf down with an intention to &s;leep, that very few per&s;ons had rea|&s;on to envy my friend Crambo the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his couch; for the feathers it contained were &s;o &s;canty that my bones rubbed again&s;t the frame of the bed; nor were they quite &s;o &s;oft in their qua|lity as eider-down; for, a few having made their way through the ticking, they annoyed my poor carca&s;s wor&s;e than &s;o many crow-quills. However, I knew that my circum&s;tances obliged me to make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity; &s;o, putting the be&s;t face I could upon the matter, I was preparing to re&s;ign my&s;elf to the arms of Morpheus, whom I &s;ecretly im|plored to &s;hed his poppy over my brow, when an accident happened that remo|ved all ideas of &s;leep for &s;ome time. This was occa&s;ioned by the retainer of
<PB N="78" REF="80">
the mu&s;es him&s;elf, who, in groping his way to the bed, &s;tumbled over &s;ome bricks, which he had artfully placed for its &s;upport at the foot, and which, fall|ing down, not only de&s;troyed the whole oeconomy of the poet's contrivance, but made &s;uch a confounded noi&s;e as alarm|ed an old woman, who &s;lept in the floor beneath, and who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion, I after|wards found, was that of a fortune-teller, a &s;ecret &s;he had picked up in the neigh|bourhood of Norwood, and, by follow|ing which, &s;he made more in a week than my friend Crambo did, by writing poetry, in a month.</P>
<P>The accident had not happened above five minutes, when the old &s;ybil made &s;hift to crawl up to the poet's door, and be&s;towed &s;uch a volley of cur&s;es upon him as made my hair &s;tand on end;
<PB N="79" REF="81">
and, among the re&s;t of her predictions, &s;he declared, without any ceremony, that Crambo would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly come to be hanged. But the little bard was &s;o exa&s;perated at the tenor of the la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, that&punc; collecting all the &s;trength he was ma&s;ter of, he ran full-but with his head again&s;t the &s;tomach of the pro|phete&s;s; but, u&s;ing more force in the bu&s;ine&s;s than was nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;he, at the &s;ame time, fa&s;tening her claws an inch deep in his throat, they tumbled together down a perpendicular height of at lea&s;t twenty feet, where they con|tinued to fight on their arrival with pro|digious ferocity, like two contending cats, till they were parted by &s;ome people who lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and came out to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">However, in a few minutes after the affray, the poet returned to his apart|ment, groaning and &s;obbing with the pain it had occa&s;ioned; but, undre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, he at la&s;t came to bed al&s;o, uttering incoherent ejaculations to the &s;upreme Being, not to procure a &s;weet &s;lumber, but to puni&s;h the wretch who had been the primary cau&s;e of his bodily torture.</P>
<P>Yet, in &s;pite of every di&s;advantage, I made &s;hift to &s;leep tolerably &s;ound, until the bright beams of the &s;un had awakened my companion, who, &s;haking me violently by the &s;houlder, broke the fetters of my repo&s;e, to inform me, that it was time he &s;hould get up and pro|cure another hat and wig, which he wi&s;hed to do as early as po&s;&s;ible, that his deficiency, in that particular, might
<PB N="81" REF="83">
not be &s;een by the neighbourhood, which, he a&s;&s;ured me, was not the lea&s;t &s;candalous within the bills of mortality; and, if I were willing to accompany him on that occa&s;ion, he &s;hould be very glad; but if, on the contrary, I was too much fatigued, he would leave me to my &s;lumbers, and return in half an hour.</P>
<P>When I rubbed my eyes &s;ufficiently to &s;urvey the apartment of poor Crambo, I mu&s;t own I felt &s;o little inclination to be left behind, being &s;truck with amazement at the wretchedne&s;s of his retreat, that I immediately told him I &s;hould be extremely happy to take a walk in &s;o fine a morning.&mdash;"Well," &s;ays the bard, <Q>if that's your re&s;olu|tion, I will &s;tep down &s;tairs, while you are dre&s;&s;ing your&s;elf, and get
<PB N="82" REF="84">
&s;omething applied to my forehead, which is extremely painful, and be with you directly.</Q> &mdash; And, indeed, he had ample occa&s;ion for a pla&s;ter; for the di&s;a&s;ter of the preceding night with the old woman had been attended with &s;ome very ugly effects; among the re&s;t, a great lump upon his forehead, about the bigne&s;s of a turkey's egg, was not the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>When the bard had left the room, I took an accurate &s;urvey of the furniture of his garret, which con&s;i&s;ted of the mi&s;erable <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> for a bed, on which, though it appeared next to an impo&s;&s;ibility that any one could clo&s;e their eyes for half an hour, I found, from recent experience, that even Mi|&s;ery could drown his feelings, in the &s;oft bands of &s;leep, even on a couch of &s;tone.
<PB N="83" REF="85">
There was likewi&s;e a &s;quare deal table, with three legs remaining out of four, which it appeared the cabinet-maker had formerly thought nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport, on which were &s;ome writings.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the time my friend Crambo and I had got out of the alley, we were both almo&s;t out of breath, not with the di&s;tance of ground we had walked over, but with the alertne&s;s we were forced to make u&s;e of to avoid &s;ome un&s;avoury &s;alutes from the windows as we pa&s;&s;ed; for, by the number of offerings which
<PB N="87" REF="89">
the cha&s;te nymphs of that di&s;trict di&s;|charged from their apartments, one would naturally conclude, that &s;acri|ficing to Cloacina was the principal amu&s;ement of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I found my&s;elf in the middle of a court, which was occupied by deal|ers in almo&s;t every article of dre&s;s, &s;uch as clothes, boots, &s;hoes, and, in &s;hort, every appurtenance nece&s;&s;ary to the completion of a fine gentleman; and, at length, we arrived at a wig-ware|hou&s;e, the windows of which were faced with &s;hambles, and ornamented with wigs for all ages, &s;exes, and complexi|ons; which the bard no &s;ooner &s;aw than he entered, beckoning me to follow him. The ma&s;ter of the &s;hop, perceiving the nature of his vi&s;it, inquired, with much complai&s;ance, if he wanted a tie-wig, a
<PB N="88" REF="90">
ja&s;y, a bob, or a major; to which the poet immediately replied, "A tie-wig." &mdash;<Q>Will your honour make a choice or take a dip?</Q> &s;ays the merchant.&mdash; "Oh! a dip by all means," replies the bard.&mdash;<Q>Why, then, come into the back-&s;hop, ma&s;ter," &s;ays the other, "and I'll fit you for &s;ixpence as well as any gemman in the land.</Q> We both followed his directions; and, going into a little back room, he produced a can|va&s;s bag, at the &s;ame time informing us, that it contained caxens of &s;uch delicate workman&s;hip as would not di&s;grace the forehead of a chief magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>When the poet had depo&s;ited his &s;ix|pence, he &s;tripped off his coat; and, the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop having opened the mouth of the repo&s;itory, the little bard put down his arm as far as he could
<PB N="89" REF="91">
reach, and, after groping about for &s;ome minutes, pulled out an old brown wig, without powder, which, from its com|plexion and di&s;order, &s;eemed to me as if it had been in the hands of a japan|ner of &s;hoes, and literally not worth two-pence. But the &s;hopkeeper, it ap|peared, thought otherwi&s;e; for, taking it from the hands of the poet, he told him, with exultation, that he was in luck, for he had brought out a wig for &s;ixpence which was hone&s;tly worth a crown between man and man, and, placing it alertly on a block, began to comb it; and indeed the ingenious wig-retailer brought it, by dint of indu&s;try, into &s;o re&s;pectable a form, that I could not help congratulating my friend Cram|bo upon the additional graces it gave his countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">The next concern being to procure a decent hat, and my companion not being over nice in re&s;pect to the fa&s;hion, he got one in a neighbouring &s;hop upon ve|ry moderate terms; and, being now equipped with the habiliments of a gen|tleman, he took leave of me, having fir&s;t exacted my promi&s;e to dine with him, at the ordinary in the cellar, at the u&s;ual hour; after which he &s;et off for Pater-no&s;ter Row, on a vi&s;it to a book&s;eller, with whom, I under&s;tood, he had articled him&s;elf, under a heavy penalty, to furni&s;h a hi&s;tory of the la&s;t war for the moderate premium of half-a-crown a &s;heet.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Captain Bli&s;&s;et.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I AM apprehen&s;ive, my young friend," (&s;aid the &s;tranger,) that you will find nothing &s;ufficiently entertaining in my hi&s;tory to repay you for the trouble of li&s;tening to a chain of occurrences that have made up the principal part of my being, and which are tinctured with an infi|nitely greater proportion of &s;orrow than of joy. However, as it appears to be your wi&s;h to hear it, I will be as brief as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I am de&s;cended from a reputable family in the north of Ireland. My name is Bli&s;&s;et; and my father was
<PB N="100" REF="102">
one of tho&s;e people who are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, in that kingdom, by the name of gentlemen-farmers; be&s;ides the profit that aro&s;e from a large por|tion of land which he rented from a neighbouring nobleman, he had a &s;mall fortune that was left him by a di&s;tant relation. On the joint i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e he contrived to live in a &s;tate of comfort, enjoying all the diver&s;ions of the country, &s;uch as hunting, fi&s;hing, and all tho&s;e amu&s;ements which are annexed to the life of a country gentleman. But, being one evening at a rural ball, he danced with a beautiful lady, who&s;e natural graces made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his heart, that he could not quit the room with|out inquiring into her name and cir|cum&s;tances; and the account he re|ceived
<PB N="101" REF="103">
was far from adding fuel to his growing love; for he learned, that &s;he was the only daughter of a gentle|man of con&s;iderable property in the adjoining county, and who intended her as a wife for a young baronet of large e&s;tate, who was hourly expect|ed to return home from the conti|nent, where he had been for &s;ome time for the improvement of his edu|cation.</P>
<P>Though this account con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed my father's hopes, it by no means removed the flame that &s;till continued to rage within his bo&s;om.&mdash; At la&s;t he contrived to have an inter|view with my mother, (for &s;o the la|dy proved in the con&s;equences, to my misfortune;) and they became &s;o perfectly agreeable to each other,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
that a private marriage was re&s;olved on, to put it out of the power of even Fate it&s;elf to divide their love.&mdash; She took an opportunity, when her father was gone to town upon bu&s;ine&s;s of the mo&s;t &s;erious importance, to con|vey the principal part of her clothes and baggage to her lover's hou&s;e, who met her, in her father's park, with a tru&s;ty &s;ervant and a carriage, into which they both got, and drove with all expedition until they arrived at the farm, where a clergyman at|tended to unite them in the indi&s;&s;olu|ble bonds of matrimony.</P>
<P>When her father returned to the country, and found how his daughter had di&s;po&s;ed of her&s;elf in wedlock without his knowledge, he grew frantic with the di&s;appointment; but
<PB N="103" REF="105">
&s;trove to forget her want of duty, and her&s;elf, by going to re&s;ide in France, where he &s;urvived the event but a few years, and left all the property he was able in large beque&s;ts to his friends and acquaintance, and the re&s;t &s;o laden with mortgages and other di&s;agreeable incumbrances, that my father was half ruined in the en|deavours to recover the remainder.&mdash; However, in &s;pite of the&s;e draw-backs on their felicity, they contrived to live very comfortably, my mother bearing him a child every year; and the fir&s;t fruit of their love was your humble &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of my being a boy &s;o plea&s;ed them both, that my parents continued to care&s;s me with
<PB N="104" REF="106">
the mo&s;t extravagant tokens of paren|tal fondne&s;s, a mode of behaviour which they pur&s;ued till I left my country and &s;aw them no more. As I grew up in &s;trength and beauty, I was indulged in every wanton and improper propen&s;ity, at the expence of my brothers and &s;i&s;ters. This partiality in my favour was &s;o glaring to every per&s;on that vi&s;ited the family, that &s;ome, who were on the mo&s;t in|timate footing with my father and mother, &s;trove to remove, or at lea&s;t to reduce, a partiality which exi&s;ted in preference to the re&s;t of the chil|dren, who were, in general, more amiable in the eyes of &s;trangers; for, the unlimited manner in which I ex|perienced their ill-timed kindne&s;&s;es had worked me up to &s;uch a pitch of
<PB N="105" REF="107">
arrogance and ill-nature, that my humour became intolerable to all tho&s;e who&s;e &s;en&s;es were not hood-winked by the unaccountable par|tiality of a parent; and various were the methods practi&s;ed by the &s;ervants to mortify young ma&s;ter Frank, (for that is my name,) while my brothers and &s;i&s;ters were treated with kindne&s;s by every one but their parents: &s;ome would take an opportunity, while they were putting on my clothes, to run a pin into my arm, as if by ac|cident, and others would give me a &s;ly pinch, which made me roar for an hour. You may be &s;ure I did not fail to make the mo&s;t of the&s;e abu&s;es to my parents; but, at la&s;t, my com|plaints became &s;o frequent and &s;o nu|merous, that they lo&s;t their credit;
<PB N="106" REF="108">
and, in the &s;equel, I was pinched and pu&s;hed about by all the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e, out of the &s;ight of my parents, without even the &s;atisfaction of having my accounts believed. In this manner was the earlier part of my life pa&s;&s;ed, till I arrived at nine years of age, when it was thought proper to &s;end me to an academy in the &s;ame county; but I had not been long there before the &s;ame &s;pirit broke out which had rendered me &s;o intolerable at home. But now the &s;cene was changed; for my humours were counteracted with a &s;tudious particularity, and my faults puni&s;hed by &s;uch &s;evere applications of the birch to my ill-fated po&s;teriors, that I could not &s;it down, for whole days &s;ucceeding the puni&s;hment. At
<PB N="107" REF="109">
length, a full, true, and particular, account reached the ears of my pa|rents, who in&s;tantly flew to the &s;chool, and charged the ma&s;ter, on pain of their di&s;plea&s;ure, not to whip me any more, but &s;trive to make me learn my ta&s;k by per&s;ua&s;ion, which they a&s;&s;ured him was a &s;ufficient incite|ment to make a boy do his duty of &s;o gentle and governable a di&s;po&s;ition as mine.</P>
<P>Leaving the ma&s;ter of the &s;emina|ry under that ridiculous re&s;triction, they returned home; and it was not long before I re&s;orted to my old tricks; which the ma&s;ter, endea|vouring to curb by the methods pre|&s;cribed by the wi&s;e authors of my be|ing, and finding them ineffectual, very fairly took the re&s;olution of
<PB N="108" REF="110">
&s;ending me back to profit by their &s;age in&s;tructions; or, in other words, turned me out of the &s;chool as an in|corrigible young puppy, who was de&s;tined to ruin, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a per|ver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, which he was for|bidden to regulate or alter by the &s;il|ly determination of two weak people, who rather cho&s;e that their offspring &s;hould &s;hoot up to manhood, dete&s;ted by every one but them&s;elves, than grow amiable, dutiful, and exempla|ry, at the expence of a &s;ore breech and a few &s;alutary tears.</P>
<P>At my return home, my parents were filled with the mo&s;t implacable re&s;entment again&s;t the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, whom they honoured with the terms of in&s;olent pedagogue, hard-hearted tyrant, and other phra&s;es equally ex|pre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="109" REF="111">
of their folly and malignity; but, at the &s;ame time, took a firm re|&s;olution that their dear Frank &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to &s;uch mercile&s;s cruelty for the future, which they were well a&s;&s;ured I had not de&s;erved, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, I had told them to the contrary; and, in con&s;equence, I was permitted to pa&s;s my time, un|til I approached a &s;tate of manhood, without receiving tho&s;e advantages of education which other young people enjoyed, for fear that di&s;cipline &s;hould break my heart and too much &s;tudy impair my con&s;titution. But, one day, after dinner, as the family were &s;itting in conver&s;ation, my mo|ther told a &s;tory of a circum&s;tance in which I was materially concerned; but her manner of relating it di&s;|plea&s;ed
<PB N="110" REF="112">
me &s;o much, that, when &s;he came to a particular part of the nar|rative, I very coolly gave her the lie direct; and, upon her offering to re|mon&s;trate with me upon the impro|priety of my behaviour, I immediately &s;pit in her face. But this la&s;t was an out|rage that not even their partiality could overlook; I was threatened by my father with per&s;onal cha&s;ti&s;ement, which I defied him to put in execu|tion; and, at length, things grew to &s;uch a height of animo&s;ity, that it was determined to purcha&s;e me a commi&s;&s;ion in the army, in one of the regiments ordered abroad, for we were then at war. Accordingly the whole bu&s;ine&s;s was immediately put <HI>en train,</HI> and I was con&s;igned to the care of a near relation of my father, in town,
<PB N="111" REF="113">
who was to provide every requi&s;ite nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an undertaking, and to give me &s;uch advice as would prove beneficial to me in my conduct as an officer, he having retired from the army but a few years, and in which he had &s;erved with an un&s;ul|lied reputation ever &s;ince he was the height of a regimental drum.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the de&s;ire of my pa|rents, the &s;age veteran formed &s;uch rules for my conduct, as he thought, from experience, would prove mo&s;t &s;erviceable; but, in general, I turn|ed &s;uch a deaf ear to his in&s;tructions as di&s;gu&s;ted the old gentleman ex|ceedingly; and, after executing his commi&s;&s;ion with fidelity, he gave me up to Fortune, as a perver&s;e young man who would one day bleed &s;e|verely
<PB N="112" REF="114">
under the rod of her di&s;plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>The morning before I took my leave of this worthy man, he &s;eized me by the hand, and, pre&s;&s;ing it be|tween his with a warmth which no|thing but true friend&s;hip could in|&s;pire, &s;poke to me, with the mo&s;t engaging complacency, in nearly the following manner: &mdash; 'My dear Frank,' &s;aid the old gentleman, 'be|fore you quit me intirely, I mu&s;t in|treat your particular attention to the advice I am now going to give you. Do not &s;hrink from it, my dear boy: it is not the &s;evere admonition of an old man, who looks with a jaundiced eye upon mankind; it is the e&s;&s;ence of all the knowledge I have gleaned in a long cour&s;e of &s;ervice, during
<PB N="113" REF="115">
which I have endeavoured not only to live in, but with, the world; and I have learned, from a knowledge of my own weakne&s;s, to look with an eye of charity upon all the frailties incident to our nature. I know the pa&s;&s;ions of youth are difficult to be re&s;trained within the circle of prudence; but I have likewi&s;e di&s;covered, my dear child, that, the more they are re|&s;tricted, the happier it is for our|&s;elves. As a &s;oldier, you &s;hould make your pa&s;&s;ions ob&s;erve the &s;ame degree of &s;ubordination to your rea|&s;on as the duties of your profe&s;&s;ion will teach you to ob&s;erve to your commanding officer: let each have its proper influence in the general &s;y&s;tem, but &s;uffer none to be licen|tious. Your own good &s;en&s;e will, I
<PB N="114" REF="116">
hope, inform you, that you have now entered into a profe&s;&s;ion who&s;e ba&s;is is virtue and honour; and that the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection of beha|viour is nece&s;&s;ary on your part to pre|&s;erve the character you have a&s;&s;umed from violation. You are now a &s;ol|dier, Frank,' &s;aid the old gentleman with a particular &s;trength of empha|&s;is; 'and you mu&s;t reflect, that you are going to join an army, of which you mu&s;t con&s;ider your&s;elf an active part, who&s;e purpo&s;e is to cru&s;h the am|bitious &s;pirit of a perfidious enemy, and furni&s;h another action of Briti&s;h glory to be recorded for ever in the ar|chives of immortal Fame. There is,' continued the grey-headed veteran, 'an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for every man, who wi&s;hes to be re&s;pected, to ob|&s;erve
<PB N="115" REF="117">
a proper degree of civility to|wards all ranks of people; and that mode of behaviour is particularly re|qui&s;ite in an officer. It &s;hould be your con&s;tant &s;tudy to de&s;erve the commendations of your general, by &s;trictly adhering to your duty; to court the good will of your brother-officers by your complai&s;ance; and to in&s;ure the ble&s;&s;ings of your inferiors by acts of kindne&s;s, rectitude, and humanity: and take my word, that the plea&s;ures you will experience, by following this line of conduct, will amply repay you for the trouble of putting it in practice; for, be&s;ides the advantage of e&s;tabli&s;hing your own content, it is the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible method of aggrandi&s;ing your fortune. To enforce this ob&s;ervation more

&s;trongly, I will tell you an anecdote of two per&s;ons whom I knew well, and the con&s;equences of who&s;e lives prove the nece&s;&s;ity of paying a proper deference to the opinion of others. &mdash; There were two friends, William and Frederic, who were educated toge|ther at the &s;ame univer&s;ity; the for|mer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;weet and gentle di&s;|po&s;ition, the latter a &s;trong under|&s;tanding; and, both happening to be under the care of the &s;ame guardian, (for they were orphans,) they follow|ed one cour&s;e of &s;tudy, and were in|tended for one profe&s;&s;ion. When they arrived at man's e&s;tate, it was thought expedient, as they had &s;ome very important connections in Ameri|ca, to &s;end them over there to &s;ettle as merchants. Accordingly they
<PB N="117" REF="119">
went to one of the principal colonies, which was then &s;ubject to the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, and carried over &s;ome &s;trong letters of recommendation to the principal people, but particularly the governor. On their arrival on the continent, they received every token of re&s;pect and friend&s;hip from the people; but, Frederic's temper being di&s;covered to be as bad and unaccom|modating as William's was good and polite, the latter naturally attracted the hearts of his acquaintance, while the former was treated with a coldne&s;s bordering on incivility, which &s;oured him to &s;uch a degree, that he at la&s;t became intolerable even to his old companion and colleague, William; and it was determined at length, for the mutual happine&s;s of both parties,
<PB N="118" REF="120">
to break up the partner&s;hip and re|imbark for England. But, previous to their departure, the governor invi|ted William and Frederic to dine with him; and, finding them both to be gentlemen of great information in re|gard to the &s;ituation of the province, he thought it proper to &s;end a letter by them to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, as two per&s;ons in every re&s;pect capable of pointing out the nece&s;&s;ity and advan|tages of a mea&s;ure which government had then in contemplation. When they arrived in England, they were both clo&s;eted with the &s;ecretary, who began with a&s;king Frederic's opinion, who gave a &s;uccinct and clear ac|count of the matter, but delivered his opinion in &s;uch a &s;upercilious and dogmatic manner as gave the mi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="119" REF="121">
more di&s;gu&s;t by his manner than he had &s;atisfaction by his infor|mation; and he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with that kind of civil and con&s;trained coldne&s;s, which clearly proved that he had lo&s;t the favourable opinion of the &s;ecretary, and &s;acrificed his fortune to the haughtine&s;s of his &s;pirit. On the contrary, William gave his opinion with equal accuracy, but with the utmo&s;t mode&s;ty; and, when the mini&s;ter had heard every thing that he could ad|vance upon the &s;ubject, he conde|&s;cended to &s;hew him a &s;ketch of the intended operations; and, after &s;peaking for a con&s;iderable time in defence of his propo&s;ed plan, he a&s;k|ed William what he thought of the undertaking; who replied, with an air of the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s and good-breeding,

that he had formerly con|ceived tho&s;e mea&s;ures would be mo&s;t &s;alutary and beneficial which had been advi&s;ed by his friend, Frederic, until he was convinced to the contra|ry by his lord&s;hip's &s;uperior rea&s;on|ing. He had &s;carcely uttered his opinion, when the mini&s;ter caught him in his arms, and told him, that he perceived he was not only a gentle|man of exten&s;ive knowledge in poli|tics, but a warm friend to his country, and that he might depend upon it he would mention him to the king; and indeed he was as good as his word, and, by the force of his inte|re&s;t, procured him a con&s;iderable po&s;t under government, which he has en|joyed with particular honour ever &s;ince, and is enabled, in con&s;equence,
<PB N="121" REF="125">
to &s;upport the intemperate and proud Frederic, who is now reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of being the object of his bounty.

<P>THE next morning, (continued the gentleman,) I embarked with the regiment for America, and arrived at Bo&s;ton after a di&s;agreeable and tedious pa&s;&s;age of upwards of two months. Not being u&s;ed to fa|tigue, the inconveniences I &s;uffered in the voyage, added to the &s;ickne&s;s I had continually while at &s;ea, made me cur&s;e the hour in which I con|&s;ented to be a &s;oldier; but, finding the die was ca&s;t, and that I mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to the &s;tern decrees of Fate, I bore my fortune as well as I could, and &s;ubmitted my body to all the

unhappy. Full often did I cur&s;e tho&s;e indulgences which I had ex|perienced from my father and mo|ther, and even hated them for giving me an exi&s;tence, which was become irk&s;ome and intolerable by their ne|glect of all the important parts of the education of a child.</P>
<P>Not to trouble you too much with a recital of trivial accidents, let it &s;uffice when I acquaint you, that, af|ter a &s;ervice of &s;omething le&s;s than two years, I got appointed to a com|pany, and was ordered by the gene|ral to take the command of a party that was &s;ent to di&s;lodge &s;ome Indians, who were &s;culking about the woods, to the great annoyance of the rear of the army. A few months previous to this expedition, I mu&s;t inform you,
<PB N="125" REF="129">
that I had a quarrel with a lieutenant who happened to be &s;tationed under my command, and I re&s;olved (&s;o dia|bolical was the complexion of my mind at that period) to take that op|portunity of getting him, if po&s;&s;ible, out of the way, or, in other words, to u&s;e &s;ome treacherous means of de&s;troying his life. We had frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes with the Indians, in all which my particular enemy, or rather the object of my hatred, came off unhurt, though I &s;tudiou&s;ly placed him in the po&s;t of danger for that purpo&s;e. As his &s;ight became every day more hateful to me, I watched all opportunities of puni&s;hing him for di&s;obedience of orders; but in this too he foiled me; for, knowing the implacability of my heart, and being
<PB N="126" REF="130">
a brave and &s;ober man, he was un|commonly punctual in the ob&s;er|vance of his duty. It being re&s;olved, in council, to make a grand attack upon a po&s;t, which the Indians po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, the next morning at day-break, I determined to place my ene|my in the hotte&s;t part of the fire; and, if he e&s;caped his death then, I had made up my mind to di&s;patch him my&s;elf, by &s;hooting him through the head.</P>
<P>Early in the morning we began the attack, which la&s;ted with unre|mitting fury for &s;ome hours; at la&s;t I was unfortunately &s;urrounded by &s;ome Indians, who made me their pri&s;oner, and carried me off in triumph. I had &s;carcely arrived among their chiefs when I was ordered to be &s;calp|ed,
<PB N="127" REF="131">
a puni&s;hment of all others the mo&s;t dreadful; and they had fa&s;ten|ed their hands in my hair, to draw the &s;kin over my &s;cull, which they were going to &s;eparate with a knife, when Providence interfered in behalf of a wretch like me; and, to make my humiliation the deeper, cho&s;e for its in&s;trument the very lieutenant who&s;e life I intended to de&s;troy. It &s;eems that, hearing of my captivity, he got a handful of men together, and, ru&s;hing through the thicke&s;t part of the enemy, arrived at the &s;pot ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave me from the bloody cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Overcome with joy at my deli|very, I fell at the feet of my benefac|tor, and a&s;ked him how he could think of venturing his life to &s;ave &s;o
<PB N="128" REF="132">
unworthy a being? to which he nobly replied, that he was not ignorant of the hatred I &s;o unju&s;tly bore him; but that a knowledge of my infernal malice, though it might alarm his feelings as a man, could not efface his duty as a Chri&s;tian, which in|&s;tructed him to &s;ave the life even of his enemy, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to return him good for evil.</P>
<P>I was &s;o awed by the maje&s;ty and benevolence of his conduct, that I took a re&s;olution, from that hour, of looking up to him as an example, and amend my life by a recollection of the means by which it had been pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable occurred, af|ter this adventure, till the campaign ended, when, the regiment I be|longed

to being ordered home, I &s;old out, in order to &s;ettle in America, having contracted a &s;oft intimacy with a lady who re&s;ided there, and whom I afterwards married.

But the &s;tranger, recovering him&s;elf, went on as follows:</P>
<P>I had not been long married, when I received a letter which informed me of the death of my father, and that my mother had married a &s;econd hu&s;band; and, at the time of my fa|ther's decea&s;e, his affairs were &s;o em|barra&s;&s;ed by the law-&s;uits which he had been maintaining for years, that he had left his family almo&s;t in a &s;tate of beggary.</P>
<P>Nor did my own private affairs turn out a whit better; for, having run out the money which I got for my commi&s;&s;ion, and the principal half of my wife's portion remaining in the hands of a capital merchant in London, who refu&s;ed to remit any part of it to the continent, we re&s;ol|ved

<P>When we arrived here, I took eve|ry prudent &s;tep, as I then thought, for the recovery of my property; &mdash; but, alas! there I was mo&s;t woefully deceived. I was ridiculous enough to build a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s upon the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e; but the event has proved that it was but a &s;orry founda|tion to erect my hope upon; for, af|ter two years &s;pent in unnece&s;&s;ary protraction, in which time I had ex|pended not only my la&s;t guinea, but every valuable I had that could rai&s;e

one, the momentous affair came to a tri|al; and I had the mortification to find, that my oppre&s;&s;or's being a richer man than my&s;elf was a certain &s;ign that he would prove victorious; and that the boa&s;ted laws of this country can af|ford but little protection to the equi|table claims of poverty and honour, when their &s;pirit and their intention can be &s;o ea&s;ily perverted by the vil|lanous ingenuity of profe&s;&s;ional man-eaters. In &s;hort, &s;ir, I lo&s;t my cau&s;e for want of &s;ufficient money to fee the coun&s;el, and the judge very gravely decreed again&s;t me, becau&s;e I had not an opportunity of telling him the rea&s;ons why he &s;hould have done otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never forget the &s;ituation of my wretched family when I returned

to inform them of the melancholy event, which had con&s;igned them to all the horrors of want and de&s;pera|tion. My poor Maria, after &s;he had recovered her &s;en&s;es a little, (for &s;he fainted repeatedly in my arms on the fir&s;t news of our defeat,) and was a&s;|&s;ured that &s;uch an account could be real, &s;he fell upon her knees, &s;ur|rounded by her half-fami&s;hed chil|dren, and implored the omnipotent Searcher of all hearts to reject the la&s;t claims of mercy, which might be in|treated, in his dying hour, by the unprincipled mi&s;creant, who had rob|bed her poor little ones of that bread, which ju&s;tice &s;hould have given them to &s;atisfy the irre&s;i&s;tible appeals of hunger.

<P>The noi&s;e, which the tender part|ner of my misfortunes had made in the wild indulgence of her &s;orrows, attracted the notice of a per&s;on, who was in the adjoining chamber, on a vi&s;it to an old couple, one of whom was bed-ridden, and, having been turn|ed out of the ho&s;pital as incurable, was obliged to lengthen his woe-fraught being by the ca&s;ual bounty of the good and charitable. Hearing the moans of di&s;tre&s;s, he gave a gen|tle tap at the door; and, lifting up the latch, he entered the room. But,
<PB N="135" REF="139">
good heavens! how was I amazed to recogni&s;e in his per&s;on the individual lieutenant that had &s;aved me from the fury of the barbarous Indians! It was &s;ome time before I could make him believe who I was, &s;o much had the woes that I had endured, and the difficulties I had experienced, altered my per&s;on &s;ince we took leave of each other: but, the moment that he was convinced of my identity, he embra|ced me with all the warmth of an old friend; and, &s;itting down with a lit|tle infant on each knee, a&s;ked the par|ticulars of my life, &s;ince we had parted, with all po&s;&s;ible delicacy and painful curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>When he had been made acquaint|ed with our &s;tory, he took my wife by one hand and me by the other, and

bade us not de&s;pair, but put our tru&s;t in God Almighty, who would receive us, if de&s;erving, into his benign bo|&s;om, and &s;hield our little family from the machinations of the wicked and the pro&s;titution of power.</P>
<P>After a pre&s;ent of &s;ome ginger-bread to the children, which I under|&s;tood he always carried about with him for that purpo&s;e, he took his leave, promi&s;ing to pay us another vi&s;it the following morning. And he was as good as his word; for he not only came to make us happy by his advice, but to comfort us by his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; and in&s;i&s;ted, as Fortune had looked upon him with an eye of kindne&s;s &s;ince he left America, by advancing him in the army, that I &s;hould partake of that bounty, (as

<P>HERE the officer took his leave, with the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for my fe|licity; and, the hour approaching that I was to meet my friend Crambo at the ordinary, I &s;et forward for that place, contemplating all the way on the vici&s;&s;i|tudes of human nature, and the in&s;cru|table and unaccountable methods by which Providence protects us from im|pending evil, and de&s;troys our faire&s;t

<P>As I de&s;cended into the quill-drivers refectory, I heard a loud laugh, which indicated that mirth pre&s;ided at the board. When I had got far enough in|to the cellar to have a glimp&s;e of the company, I perceived my friend Cram|bo as merry as the be&s;t of them.

In&s;tead of a &s;y&s;tem, to fa&s;ten on her cap, which &s;he had imported but the day before from Cranborn-alley, &s;he wore an old wig of her former hu&s;|band's, which was frizzled and tortu|red into the &s;hape nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e; and, when fa&s;tened on her head, her vi&s;age, by the aid of this modi&s;h ornament, bore no bad re|&s;emblance to the forehead of a New|foundland dog.</P>
<P>The company, invited on that memorable evening, con&s;i&s;ted of a few &s;elect neighbours: &mdash; Mrs. Gro|gram, the old-clothes woman; a rich chimney-&s;weeper's lady, and her two daughters; a pettifogging attor|ney; Mrs. Snatch'em, the pawnbro|ker's widow, from the corner of the

oppo&s;ite alley; the tallow-chandler's nephew; and your humble &s;ervant.</P>
<P>When the clock had &s;truck four, this goodly group had a&s;&s;embled; and it was plain, that the bridegroom had exhau&s;ted not only his pur&s;e, but his invention, to dre&s;s him&s;elf out to the be&s;t advantage, and make his per&s;on as engaging and irre&s;i&s;tible as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>He had cho&s;en a deep-coloured Pru&s;|&s;ian-blue coat, that would have been con&s;idered as the pink of elegance about half a century ago, the cuffs being large enough to make a mo|dern wai&s;tcoat, with flaps down to his heels; and the dark blue was finely relieved by a large row of bra&s;s buttons, which covered at lea&s;t one-fourth of that part of his habili|ments.
<PB N="145" REF="151">
Added to this, he had on a &s;carlet wai&s;tcoat of prodigious mag|nitude, a pair of buck&s;kin breeches, and a wig, without powder, in cir|cumference as large as a moderate goo&s;eberry-bu&s;h; which, con&s;idering the inten&s;e heat of the weather, was a dre&s;s, taken all together, that mu&s;t naturally, as you will imagine, at|tract our notice, if not our admira|tion.</P>
<P>After tea, the whole party was &s;ummoned to attend the hymeneal al|tar; and, when we had got to the door, to &s;tep into the coaches that waited for our reception, there was as great a croud gathered in the &s;treet, to behold our dre&s;s and equipage, as if the lord-mayor of London were going to We&s;tmin&s;ter in &s;olemn pro|ce&s;&s;ion

<P>In the cour&s;e of this tremendous &s;ervice, a few mi&s;takes happened, which &s;ometimes di&s;concerted the whole bu&s;ine&s;s; but you will not wonder at that, when I inform you, that the bridegroom was as deaf as a mill-po&s;t; and the prie&s;t, when he came to that part of the affair which requires him to a&s;k the bridegroom,

But this was not all the impe|diment which took place; for ano|ther important mi&s;take occurred, which was no other than the bride|groom's putting the ring on the wrong finger of his amiable &s;pou&s;e; and this unfortunate &s;troke of Fate cau&s;ed an infinite deal of trouble to
<PB N="148" REF="154">
the parties; for the hero of the even|ing, being a man of a narrow and avaricious di&s;po&s;ition, had purcha&s;ed a &s;econd-hand ring for the occa&s;ion, from his neighbour, the pawnbroker, which, unluckily, not being mea|&s;ured to the lady's finger, proved too &s;mall; but the bridegroom, by dint of per&s;onal &s;trength, had ab&s;olutely forced it on the poor gentlewoman's middle finger ere the mi&s;take was found out; and then, the endeavour to pull it off being found impo&s;&s;ible, the ceremony was fini&s;hed without it, and the ble&s;&s;ing perhaps conveyed with equal efficacy to the parties, notwith&s;tanding &s;o gro&s;s a violation of pre&s;cribed order.</P>
<P>As we returned home, the bride expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts as to the vali|dity
<PB N="149" REF="155">
of the obligation they had mu|tually entered into, as &s;he imagined the blunder of her yoke-fellow, in the wrong application of that impor|tant appendage to matrimony on the finger of a lady, had in a great degree defeated the intention of that &s;acred bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;he began to enlarge on the &s;tupidity of &s;ome people with &s;uch a tincture of bitterne&s;s, that we certainly &s;hould have had a matrimo|nial duet, in proper character, before the con&s;ummation, if I had not luckily ob&s;erved, that the mi&s;take was of no &s;ort of con&s;equence whate|ver, for that the per&s;onal liberty of his maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects might be charmed away, with equal force, by placing the ring on the wrong finger as well as on the right. As my land|lady
<PB N="150" REF="156">
paid a &s;ort of deference to my opinion, I had the good fortune to accommodate the matter before it ar|rived at what might be called a downright di&s;pute, but not without a few oblique hints, from the lady, which proved pretty clearly to the company, that &s;he was not perfectly &s;atisfied with a hu&s;band, who did not, upon all occa&s;ions, know what u&s;e to make of his wife's ring.</P>
<P>But now, the cavalcade arriving at the bride's door, the betrothed cou|ple were handed out of the carriage, attended by the huzzas of three-fourths of the vagabond-inhabitants of that enlightened and elegant quar|ter of the town.

To be &s;ure, d'ye &s;ee, as how I ought to be &s;orry for the death of a rela|tion;

<P>During this exemplary dialogue, the pretended countryman plied the tallow-chandler with large gla&s;&s;es of punch, half the ingredients of which were &s;trong brandy, until they had brought him to a proper pitch of in|&s;en&s;ibility, when one of the party came running in to inform his a&s;&s;o|ciates in iniquity that all was ready, which, it &s;eems, was a watch-word for bringing out the bridegroom; &mdash; and, each taking hold of an arm and a leg, they conveyed him to the door, where a &s;tage-coach was waiting for
<PB N="156" REF="162">
&s;ome pa&s;&s;engers; and, taking him to the rear of the carriage, they threw the poor tallow-chandler, by main force, into the ba&s;ket, like a &s;tinking &s;almon into the Thames, in which &s;ituation he lay, bent double, and &s;noring as loud as the hogs at Vaux|hall, until he was waked, the next morning, at Winche&s;ter, by the o&s;t|ler's throwing in a heavy portman|teau, which, alighting on the brea&s;t of the intoxicated bridegroom, en|tirely broke the fetters of his repo&s;e, as well as three of his fal&s;e ribs; and he was in&s;tantly dragged out of his uncomfortable bed-chamber, roaring like a bull with agony, by the &s;er|vants of the inn, who &s;ecured him as a fellow who only feigned to be drunk, and had &s;tolen into the ba&s;ket

<P>The&s;e particulars I have &s;ince learned from one of the con&s;pirators.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The poet gives me &s;ome &s;alutary advice. &mdash; He is attracted by my abilities. &mdash; Con|&s;ults me on his literary pur&s;uits. &mdash; I forfeit his friend&s;hip by the exerci&s;e of my candour. &mdash; A &s;arca&s;tic colloquy be|tween the ho&s;t and the poet. &mdash; The lat|ter's overthrow and di&s;comfiture.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the company had applauded Mr. M'Pa&s;te for his &s;tory, which he a&s;&s;ured them he &s;hould work into a tale, and have in&s;erted in the next month's publication, we all &s;at down to dinner; at the conclu&s;ion of which my friend Crambo and I retired to another part of the room, in order to di&s;cour&s;e upon our private affairs, and think of
<PB N="160" REF="166">
&s;ome expedient by which I might be enabled to get a livelihood, without ex|i&s;ting by the &s;ale of the few articles of wearing-apparel I had left. After ru|minating upon a variety of projects, the poet advi&s;ed me to look into the daily papers, where I &s;hould be certain of reading, among the li&s;t of the <HI>wanteds,</HI> &s;omething that would an&s;wer my pur|po&s;e. At the &s;ame time the gene|rous &s;on of Apollo made me an unli|mited offer of his pur&s;e and friend&s;hip, &s;uch as they were, upon all occa&s;ions; and, throwing the former upon the ta|ble, emptied its contents, which con|&s;i&s;ted of two half-crown pieces, a &s;ix|pence with a hole in it, a few halfpence, and a tobacco-&s;topper.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much affected by this in|&s;tance of his genero&s;ity, that I could
<PB N="161" REF="167">
not refrain from getting up and hugging him in my arms, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted friend I had in the world; a compliment which he returned with great ardour, and accompanied it with an ob&s;ervation even more plea&s;ing than his bounty, namely, that he had been attracted &s;olely by the purity of my judgement and my abilities as a &s;cholar. Such an eulogium from any one would have given me plea&s;ure; but, when I con&s;idered it as coming from the mouth of one of the greate&s;t authors of the age, (for &s;uch I had conceived him to be from his own broad in&s;inuations,) I was tran&s;ported by my vanity to a pitch of the utmo&s;t extravagance, and did not fail to extol my panegyri&s;t to the &s;kies in terms of unbounded flattery; all which, though but the incen&s;e of a no|vice
<PB N="162" REF="168">
like me, he received with peculiar complai&s;ance, and was plea&s;ed to de|clare him&s;elf as happy in my commen|dation as if the Stagyrite him&s;elf had peeped from his tomb to &s;ignify his ap|probation of the labours of his brain.</P>
<P>After &s;wearing an eternal attachment to each other, he took a parcel of pa|pers from a pocket made within-&s;ide his wai&s;tcoat; and, &s;preading them upon the table in particular order, addre&s;&s;ed me as follows: "Mr. Varni&s;h," &s;aid the diminutive bard, "I am now going to give you an unque&s;tionable proof of my confidence, which no man in my circum&s;tances would, if he were not previou&s;ly convinced of your ex|perience and ta&s;te as a &s;cholar, as well as of your un&s;haken fidelity to my intere&s;t as an individual. In
<PB N="163" REF="169">
&s;hort, my dear &s;ir," exclaimed the poet, &s;queezing my hand, "I am go|ing to &s;hew you &s;ome hints, mere li|terary atoms to be &s;ure, but &s;uch, I flatter my&s;elf, as, when called into form, will not only &s;ecure me the <HI>otium cum dignitate</HI> at pre&s;ent, but, what is infinitely more dear to my imagination, will hand me down to po&s;terity with a laurel wreathed around my brow, &s;o ample, that the very &s;hadow of it &s;hall hide the weakne&s;&s;es of my nature. Here, my dear friend, are the precious mor|&s;els," &s;aid the poet, holding up the papers, "upon which I mu&s;t inevitably build my fame and fortune. But, to return to the intent of this commu|nication, let us now commune a lit|tle upon the &s;cheme I have in agita|tion;
<PB N="164" REF="170">
and I intreat you, as my parti|cular friend, to point out &s;uch parts as &s;hall appear objectionable to you; for the very be&s;t writers that ever ex|i&s;ted have been obliged to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of their friends on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, Mr. Varni&s;h, you know: &mdash; Pope had his Bolingbroke, Pru&s;&s;ia's monarch his Voltaire, and Moliere his old woman; <HI>humanum e&s;t errare;</HI> but it is the lot of our nature; the mo&s;t brilliant genius that ever ho|noured the blazing ages of antiquity was not perfect. No," continues my friend, Crambo, "ab&s;olute perfec|tion is not to be found on this earth, that is certain. But, &agrave;-propos, to bu&s;ine&s;s, or perhaps you may think the exordium of more importance than the &s;ubject: the affair, that I
<PB N="165" REF="171">
mean to con&s;ult you upon, my young Ari&s;totle, is an epic poem; and the ba&s;is of it is," &s;aid the poet, leaning acro&s;s the table, and whi&s;per|ing in my ear with a tone of exultation, the &s;iege of Gibraltar. &mdash; Well," &s;ays the little author, looking me full in the face, and rubbing his hands, "I hope you will admit, my friend, that I have been tolerably lucky in my &s;ubject at lea&s;t." "I think &s;o too, indeed," replied I; "for I know of no theme &s;o proper, for the pen of an Engli&s;hman, as the glorious atchieve|ments of his own countrymen."</P>
<P>"You charm me by the propriety of your ob&s;ervations," replies the poet; "I prote&s;t you have an amazing deal of judgement, apt and comprehen&s;ive; and, what is better, damme but you are a true patriot."</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="172">I bowed my acknowledgements for the favour of &s;uch compliments, when the bard produced the argument of the fir&s;t book for my con&s;ideration. &mdash; When I had peru&s;ed it a little, I ventu|red to point out an inaccuracy in the po|et's manner of treating the &s;tory; to which he &s;ignificantly replied, with a nod of the head, <Q>Aye, aye, read on, my friend, if you plea&s;e; the deeper you get into the marrow, the more you will be ravi&s;hed with the per|formance.</Q></P>
<P>I proceeded, agreeably to his direc|tions, to read farther, and carefully to examine the matter as I went on. At la&s;t, coming, in my humble opinion, to a manife&s;t impropriety, I gave my opi|nion of it with all the freedom of a man who felt him&s;elf intere&s;ted in the reputa|tion
<PB N="167" REF="173">
of his friend. But I found, that the author was &s;o far from taking it in this point of view, that he demurred again&s;t my ob&s;ervation, and added, &mdash; <Q>Pi&s;h! man, I perceive you are not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the &s;ub|ject.</Q></P>
<P>I told him, in reply, <Q>that, though I did not pretend to be a poet, I could lay &s;ome claim to a &s;trong memory; and that informed me, the plot was ill managed; and, if &s;uch a breach of propriety were admi&s;&s;ible in an epic poem, it was not to be reconci|led to the laws of truth; and, to de|part from truth, in &s;uch a theme, were to di&s;honour the cau&s;e he meant to immortali&s;e.</Q> But here I found that I had over&s;hot my mark; for the little bard, looking at me with a coun|tenance
<PB N="168" REF="174">
reddened high with ferocious indignation, &s;natched the manu&s;cript out of my hand with great violence, and told me, in direct terms, that he had been gro&s;sly deceived in ranking me for a man of under&s;tanding, when I had not di&s;cernment enough to di&s;cover a literary beauty, if it were even &s;et down in Ro|man capitals.</P>
<P>I now began to &s;mell my error, and would willingly have retracted, but I found it was too late; for, upon my at|tempting to open my mouth, he turned round to the landlord of the place, and cried aloud, "Damme, landlord, here is a pretty fellow pretends to judge of an epic poem, and he has not read enough to di&s;tingui&s;h between the excellence of the Iliad and the mummery and tra&s;h contained in the

life of Tom Hickathrift! Here, you Mr. Critic," cries the bard to me, "be &s;o good as to return me the two &s;hillings, you dog, I lent you to pay for your dinner." "What? you have lent him money, too!" &s;ays the landlord, laughing heartily. "Yes," replies, the poet, "and he has made me a damned grateful return for it." &mdash; By Ch&mdash;t," &s;ays the landlord, I am glad of it." "Why are you glad?" replies the bard, bri&s;tling up to the ho&s;t like an enraged turkey-cock. "Why?" cries the other, "becau&s;e you would &s;ooner be giving your mo|ney to any idle vagabond, like that, than pay your lawful debts." &mdash; You tell a damned lie," &s;ays the po|et.

"Why, you poor dog, that is impo&s;&s;ible," &s;ays the bard, "for you never kept one, but have &s;pent your life under ground, grubbing for an exi&s;tence like a mole in a meadow, until you have become as blind, to your own intere&s;t, as the reptile you imitate." "Blind!" &s;ays the landlord, with all the dignity he could a&s;&s;ume. "Aye, I &s;ay blind," cries the follower of the mu&s;es, "or you would never affront a man of ge|nius, when he conde&s;cends to eat in your infernal regions." "Conde|&s;cend to eat, quotha!" replies the &s;ubterranean cook; &mdash; "damme, you &s;nivelling dog, you know you would have been &s;tarved long ago, if it had not been for many a good &s;lice from

my &s;urloin, which I &s;uffered you to take upon tick from a motive of cha|rity; you know I did, you ungrate|ful &s;coundrel." "Surloin!" cries the author, enraged to the &s;ummit of madne&s;s by the foregoing remarks; &mdash; "damme, you never had a &s;urloin in your cellar." "What had I then, you mongrel maker of ver&s;es?" re|joins the ho&s;t. "Ox-cheek and neck of beef," &s;ays the other. "And too good for you, and be damned to you," replies the landlord. "You lie, you &s;coundrel," cries the bard. Do I?" &s;ays the other; "damme, I will teach you better manners;"&mdash; and immediately threw the remains of a &s;hin of beef at the poet, which &s;triking him on the &s;ide of his head, he in&s;tantly

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Take a lodging. &mdash; The &s;ymbols of an au|thor. &mdash; Reflections on the neglect of ge|nius.&mdash;Walk out, and meet with an old acquaintance. &mdash; My prejudice again&s;t the count removed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I HAD not proceeded far in the &s;treet before I recollected, that it was a &s;tep ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to provide my&s;elf with a lodging; and, as the evening was advancing with rapid &s;trides, and the enamoured charioteer of day was po&s;ting to his Thetis on the wings of love, I thought it high time to be as indu&s;trious in the &s;ettlement of that bu|&s;ine&s;s as po&s;&s;ible. I had &s;carcely taken the re&s;olution, when, pa&s;&s;ing by a mean
<PB N="174" REF="180">
&s;ort of a hou&s;e, I perceived a bill &s;tuck on the window, &s;ignifying that they had lodgings to let for &s;ingle gentlemen. &mdash; Though I had but very &s;lender preten|&s;ions to the character of a gentleman, I re&s;olved to try what &s;ort of accommoda|tion the hou&s;e afforded; and, accor|dingly, knocking at the door, a woman came, who fir&s;t took an accurate &s;urvey of my figure in &s;o &s;urly a manner as con|vinced me that &s;he was not very fond of my appearance, and then a&s;ked my bu|&s;ine&s;s. I replied, that I wanted a lod|ging, and, if any in her hou&s;e &s;uited me, I had no objection to take them. &mdash; She told me, I was an utter &s;tranger to her, to be &s;ure; but, as &s;he conceived &s;omething favourable from my counte|nance, if we could agree, why &s;he would as &s;oon let me have a room in her hou&s;e
<PB N="175" REF="181">
as another; that, to be &s;ure, &s;he never had any thing but gentlemen lodge in her hou&s;e; "but," &s;ays the old hag, "we mu&s;t not always judge from ap|pearances; hand&s;ome is that hand|&s;ome does; and your money may be as good to me as another's."</P>
<P>After this preamble I had a &s;trong in|clination to go away, thinking the lod|gings might be too elegant for me, until &s;he informed me that &s;he had but one room unoccupied, and the la&s;t gentle|man that lived in it was a poet. "Oh ho! my good landlady," &s;ays I, "&s;hew me the apartment directly, for I am &s;ure, if it was not too good for a poet, it will do very well for your humble &s;ervant." So &s;aying, I &s;hut the door, and followed the poor woman, up four pair of &s;tairs, into a back gar|ret.
<PB N="176" REF="182">
"Here," cries &s;he, leaning upon an old table to recover her breath, &mdash; "this is the only place I have to &s;pare at pre&s;ent, and this has been empty but three weeks, only &s;ince poor Mr. Cou|plet left it." "Aye, aye, my good woman," replied I, "I could have gue&s;&s;ed at the la&s;t tenant by the relies of his profe&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are the true &s;ymbols of genius," cried I, taking up the &s;tump of a pen, a wa&s;herwoman's bill, and a &s;hoe without a heel. "You are merry," &s;aid the old lady; "but I a&s;&s;ure you Mr. Couplet was as fine a &s;poken man as you would meet with in a &s;ummer's day." "And, pray," replied I, "how came you to lo&s;e &s;o accompli&s;hed a lodger?" "Aye, poor gentleman!" cries the landlady, wiping her eyes; "good lack! he was
<PB N="177" REF="183">
was arre&s;ted one evening on a note of his printer's, and is now writing a parcel of &s;ermons, for a Norfolk clergyman, in the ma&s;ter's &s;ide of the Fleet pri&s;on." "Yes, I thought it would come to that," replied I, when you mentioned his profe&s;&s;ion; for there are only two things of which a man of genius may be &s;aid to be certain in this world." "And, pray, what are they?" a&s;ked my landlady. "A pri&s;on while he exi&s;ts, and a grave when he is no more: he is con&s;igned to the fir&s;t becau&s;e he has more &s;pirit than oeconomy, and he is indebted for the latter to the convenience of his neighbours; and, what is &s;till more melancholy, there are many per&s;ons, who will give a guinea for his works, bound in
<PB N="178" REF="184">
Morocco, when he is dead, that would perhaps have denied him the loan of a crown, when living, to have protracted his mi&s;erable ex|i&s;tence." "Anon!" cried the wo|man. "Oh! nothing," rejoined I:&mdash; how much do you a&s;k for this apart|ment?" "Two &s;hillings a week is the lowe&s;t that I can afford it at," cries the other; "if you are willing to give that, you may take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion di|rectly." I nodded a&s;&s;ent to her pro|po&s;al, and the bargain was ratified.</P>
<P>The woman was retiring out of the room before I ob&s;erved that my apart|ment was totally deficient in one nece&s;|&s;ary, and even indi&s;pen&s;able, article of furniture, namely, a bed; and, upon my intimating this defect to the wrinkled gentlewoman, &s;he waddled over to an old
<PB N="179" REF="185">
che&s;t of drawers, as I imagined, and, un|hinging the &s;ides, let down a bed&s;tead with all the apparatus, in the &s;ame breath informing me, that there was one, at my &s;ervice, good enough for the be&s;t man in the land. Though I was not an entire convert to her method of thinking in regard to the beauty of the affair, I was very well &s;atisfied, as it was full as elegant as I could wi&s;h in &s;uch a &s;ituation; &s;o, wi&s;hing my land|lady &s;afe down &s;tairs, I &s;at upon one corner of my couch, with a heart heavy laden with &s;orrow, and my arms enfold|ed, and broke out into the following ejaculation: &mdash; <Q>Haple&s;s, mi&s;erable, man! how art thou &s;ubjected to the caprice of Fortune! who, not &s;atis|fied with making thy wretched being groan under the pre&s;&s;ure of pain and
<PB N="180" REF="186">
hunger, and &s;ubject to the inclement elements, adds, to aggravate thy ca|lamities, the intolerable &s;tings of mental pain. To what purpo&s;e are we decreed to exi&s;t? if to prolong a &s;eries of days clouded with misfor|tune, it were better that we were al|together extinct; for the continuance of a life &s;uch as mine is not worth the &s;olicitation. I am poor, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t be de&s;pi&s;ed; and, be|ing naturally un&s;u&s;picious, am hourly liable to the &s;ubtle arts of hypocri&s;y and impo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>After I had indulged my&s;elf in this reverie, I &s;at mu&s;ing upon the mo&s;t pro|bable means of rai&s;ing a &s;mall &s;upply of money. I revolved upon every expe|dient that my fancy could &s;ugge&s;t to my de&s;pair; but found them all either un|productive
<PB N="181" REF="187">
as to the de&s;ired end, or im|po&s;&s;ible to be put in execution. I was rapidly &s;inking from one ba&s;e idea to another, until I found my mind a chaos of confu&s;ion, in which de&s;peration and &s;hame alternately pa&s;&s;ed before me. To relieve my&s;elf from this heavy embar|ra&s;&s;ment, I took up my hat, and, walk|ing down &s;tairs &s;ullenly, ru&s;hed into the &s;treet, with a full determination to rai&s;e &s;ome money by one means or another.</P>
<P>As I was rambling along in this &s;tate of perturbation, without knowing which path to pur&s;ue for the be&s;t, I felt a tap on the &s;houlder, from a per&s;on behind, which was given with an air of great fa|miliarity; and, upon my turning round to recogni&s;e the per&s;on who had &s;aluted me &s;o unexpectedly, a young man held out his hand as an overture of friend|&s;hip,
<PB N="182" REF="188">
and gave me to under&s;tand, that he had enjoyed the plea&s;ure of my com|pany, a few days before, at an ordinary near the Seven Dials. I in&s;tantly recol|lected him to be one of the gentlemen, to who&s;e notice my very good friend, the count, had introduced me. As this rencounter brought his ungenerous be|haviour to me fre&s;h into my memory, I told my new acquaintance the whole &s;to|ry, without di&s;gui&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t cir|cum&s;tance. When I came to that part of the narrative, where he declared his intentions of making my fortune by marriage, and had &s;o completely lulled my under&s;tanding by the force of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t flattery that was ever directed to a human being, the young man bur&s;t into an immoderate fit of laughter. As I con&s;idered the exce&s;&s;ive mirth of my
<PB N="183" REF="189">
new friend to be another in&s;tance of my di&s;grace, in con&s;equence of the count's lies and ingenuity, I inveighed again&s;t him in the &s;evere&s;t terms of reproach that my re&s;entment could furni&s;h me with, and &s;wore to cha&s;ti&s;e him per|&s;onally the fir&s;t time that I &s;hould meet with him. Here my new acquaintance thought proper to correct the violence of my language, by ob&s;erving, that, ad|mitting the count had played a few of his u&s;ual pranks at my expence, I &s;hould yet find it my intere&s;t to keep well with him. "Be&s;ides," added he, "the account you have heard of his character, from the landlady, mu&s;t have ari&s;en from prejudice; for it is not only overcharged, but in many re|&s;pects entirely fal&s;e, and could have proceeded from no other but the
<PB N="184" REF="190">
mouth of his enemy; for, though I will admit that he is fond of indul|ging an eccentric di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ometimes fa&s;tens too clo&s;e upon the weakne&s;&s;es of mankind, believe me that he is neither de&s;titute of principle or of friend&s;hip, but very often exer|ci&s;es both, in the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted manner, for the advantage of his fellow-creatures." This te&s;timony of the &s;tranger, in favour of the count, tended con&s;iderably to reduce the ill opinion I had formed of him; and the more particularly when my new compa|nion a&s;&s;ured me, that he would pay me what he had borrowed the fir&s;t time that he &s;aw me, and would chearfully lend me as much more, provided he had it in his pocket, and my nece&s;&s;ities called for &s;uch an in&s;tance of his genero&s;ity.</P>

<P>We agree to drink together. &mdash; I am com|forted by his di&s;cour&s;e. &mdash; He favours me with a &s;hort hi&s;tory of his life. &mdash; The melancholy death of a good wo|man, occa&s;ioned by the wickedne&s;s of mankind. &mdash; My &s;pirits rai&s;ed by Mr. Butler's philo&s;ophy.&mdash;Pledge my wai&s;t-coat.&mdash;Am promi&s;ed relief by the keeper of a regi&s;ter-office.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was now propo&s;ed, by my new ad|herent, that we &s;hould drink toge|ther to our better acquaintance; and I felt my&s;elf extremely mortified to tell him, that I was obliged to defer that favour. "Oh! damn it," replies the
<PB N="186" REF="192">
young fellow, "if you are &s;hy from the want of ready ca&s;h, never mind that. To be &s;ure I am not very rich my|&s;elf," continues he; "but, as what we &s;hall &s;pend new will not make me a penny poorer at the year's end, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon your accompanying me. They fell excellent porter at the Crooked Billet, yonder," cries he, pointing to an alehou&s;e at the end of the &s;treet; "and take my word for it, that it will warm the cockles of your heart, and operate like a draught from the Lethean lake; it will make you forget your cares, my boy," gi|ving me a hearty flap upon the back; &mdash; &s;o come along, do you &s;ee, and make no more words about the matter."</P>
<P>By the force of this per&s;ua&s;ion, I fol|lowed him to the hou&s;e; and, taking
<PB N="187" REF="193">
our &s;eats, he called for a tankard of the be&s;t, which &s;oon made its appear|ance, mantling with a maje&s;tic head at the top, like a &s;mall-cauliflower; which he gently removed a&s;ide, and drank to our mutual pro&s;perity; then, offering me the ve&s;&s;el in my turn, I was &s;o fond of the health-giving beverage, that I took care to &s;ee the bottom of the tankard before my lips would permit the &s;alu|brious liquid to &s;eparate from their, em|braces.</P>
<P>When we had become a little more intimate, by the influence of the tan|kard, (for it is wonderful how forcibly that operates in cementing friend&s;hips,) my new acquaintance informed me, without re&s;erve, of his &s;ituation in life, and his willingne&s;s to prove of &s;ervice to me if I thought him worthy of &s;uch a
<PB N="188" REF="194">
di&s;tinction; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring me, that he was him&s;elf by no means unacquainted with misfortune. I had &s;carcely time to thank him for his kind offer, when he unbo&s;omed him&s;elf in the following terms:</P>
<Q><P>My name, &s;ir, &s;ays he, is But|ler; my father was an officer in a marching regiment, who died when I was but ten years old, and left my mother to &s;truggle with an iniquitous world, incumbered with two chil|dren, &mdash; my&s;elf, and my &s;i&s;ter, who was my elder by two years. As they had contrived, in my father's life|time, to live in a &s;tyle of &s;ome re|&s;pectability, &s;he had contracted a nu|merous acquaintance, &s;ome of whom had it in their power to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; &mdash; and, as &s;he had frequently received
<PB N="189" REF="195">
the mo&s;t unconditional offers of friend&s;hip from them, &s;he thought it no breach of propriety or delicacy, to call their profe&s;&s;ions into practice, when &s;he found her&s;elf in a &s;ituation that made &s;o exalted an exerci&s;e of the human wi&s;hes nece&s;&s;ary. But here my good mother found &s;he had been leaning for a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon a bro|ken &s;taff; for, as &s;oon as her polite friends di&s;covered (and they po&s;&s;e&s;s uncommon &s;agacity upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions) that her circum&s;tances denied her the power of fulfilling the reci|procity of beneficial offices, they gradually fell off in their attach|ments, and the vi&s;ible declen&s;ion of their friend&s;hip began with pity and ended with contempt. Dejected with the unfavourable pro&s;pect of her
<PB N="190" REF="196">
affairs, &s;he found that &s;he mu&s;t exert her utmo&s;t indu&s;try to maintain her&s;elf and family; which &s;he effected, however, very tolerably, by taking in plain-work, in the performance of which, my &s;i&s;ter, though young, af|forded her con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &mdash; and the profits of that, annexed to the &s;canty pittance allowed from go|vernment to the widows of &s;ubaltern officers, ju&s;t furni&s;hed a bare &s;uffi|ciency to bring us up with decency and frugality. In this confined man|ner we contrived to jog on, until, one day, &s;he received an unexpected vi&s;it from a di&s;tant relation, who had held a place of importance under the Ea&s;t-India company, and who propo|&s;ed to u&s;e his intere&s;t with the direc|tors in procuring me a place in
<PB N="191" REF="197">
&s;ome of the public offices. My mo|ther was overjoyed at this pro&s;pect of my &s;ucce&s;s, and, in con&s;equence, &s;trained every nerve to give me a &s;uitable education. When I had at|tained my fifteenth year, not hearing from her kin&s;man, &s;he wrote him a letter upon the &s;ubject, which he conde&s;cended to an&s;wer after a delay of four months; but the &s;weetne&s;s of the contents attoned for the &s;eeming coolne&s;s and neglect; &mdash; for, in that letter, he a&s;&s;ured my mother that &s;he need not be unea&s;y, for he had got an ab&s;olute promi&s;e that I &s;hould be ap|pointed to the fir&s;t vacancy that fell. And, as the appearances of good for|tune are &s;ometimes not content with coming alone, another circum&s;tance took place, at this time, which gave
<PB N="192" REF="198">
additional happine&s;s to the poor wi|dow. My &s;i&s;ter, who was remarka|bly tall and hand&s;ome for her years, had attracted the notice of a gentle|man of immen&s;e property; and his pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o deeply rooted, that he wrote a letter to my &s;i&s;ter, de&s;iring an interview, in which he made the mo&s;t ardent and unequivocal declaration of his love. My &s;i&s;ter had no &s;ooner received this flaming epi&s;tle, than &s;he ran in triumph to her mother, and &s;hewed the flattering te&s;timony of her own powers of attraction; and the poor woman was not le&s;s tran&s;|ported than her daughter, for &s;he lite|rally believed that the endowments of her child were capable of &s;ubduing the heart of an emperor, and had no doubt of the reality of the circum|&s;tance.
<PB N="193" REF="199">
Indeed this was my good parent's weak &s;ide; for, if ever &s;he di&s;covered more folly than u&s;ual, it was in the extravagance of her rap|tures, whenever &s;he heard the voice of deceit attribute that degree of beauty to my &s;i&s;ter, and under&s;tanding to my&s;elf, which the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence had perhaps denied both the one and the other. But, as the partiality is amiable, though de&s;truc|tive, it ought to be forgiven.</P>
<P>To return to the narrative: my &s;i&s;|ter was permitted to give her ena|moured &s;wain &s;uch encouragement as was con&s;i&s;tent with prudence; but, at the &s;ame time, to take no material &s;teps in the affair without fir&s;t con|&s;ulting her mother. In the infancy of the attachment, poor Loui&s;a (for that
<PB N="194" REF="200">
was her name) faithfully fulfilled the en|gagement entered into with her fond pa|rent;&mdash;but, at la&s;t &s;he permitted her lo|ver to make &s;ome &s;mall inroads upon decorum, which &s;he well knew would be di&s;plea&s;ing to the author of her be|ing, and for that rea&s;on &s;he concealed them from her knowledge; till, at length, poor girl! &s;he waded &s;o deep in the habits of deception, that even the idea of a fal&s;ehood had lo&s;t its con&s;equent horror.</P>
<P>Unhappy Loui&s;a! &s;he little ima|gined that &s;he was wounding her eter|nal happine&s;s, when &s;he lo&s;t &s;ight of the beauty of truth. In &s;hort, even|tually pa&s;&s;ing from one indi&s;cretion to another, the rapid approaches of vice became le&s;s formidable as they be|came more frequent, until prudence
<PB N="195" REF="201">
at length abdicated her gentle bo|&s;om, and left the defencele&s;s victim a prey to the alluring arts of pro&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>To come to the cata&s;trophe in a few words. My poor &s;i&s;ter fell a prey to the in&s;inuations of a villain, who fir&s;t perjured his &s;oul to draw her from the arms of innocence and peace, and then con&s;igned her to de|&s;truction for giving faith to his dete&s;|table and infernal frauds. On the news of this mi&s;erable event, my mo|ther was &s;eized with a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, which terminated in a deep melancho|ly; and her di&s;order was &s;trengthen|ed, when, at her particular reque&s;t, I went to the India-hou&s;e, to enquire after her relation, from whom &s;he had not heard for a con&s;iderable time,
<PB N="196" REF="202">
and learned, to my &s;orrow, that he had been gone to the continent for &s;ome months before; and, &s;o far from having got me the &s;ituation he promi&s;ed, that he had never &s;o much as mentioned my name to the board of directors. Both the&s;e di&s;appoint|ments affected her peace &s;o much, that her melancholy ended in a con|firmed madne&s;s; and &s;he died, poor woman!" (cried Mr. Butler with the tears in his eyes,) "in Bedlam-ho&s;pi|tal, a &s;hocking &s;pectacle of woe and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Since her death, I have procured my&s;elf a decent livelihood by writing for attorneys, in which &s;ituation I have continued ever &s;ince. To be &s;ure, we are obliged to work devili&s;h hard for what we earn; and the &s;er|vice
<PB N="197" REF="203">
is not the mo&s;t re&s;pectable. Be|&s;ides, I am perfectly convinced, that, if the finer feelings of human nature are to be rendered callous by exam|ple, it mu&s;t be by a&s;&s;ociating with that right honourable fraternity. &mdash; But, as the motto of our family has been <HI>Il faut manger,</HI> from time im|memorial, I am &s;ometimes obliged to &s;acrifice my ea&s;e and my ambition to fulfil the intent of &s;o important an obligation.</P></Q>
<P>When my companion had fini&s;hed his &s;tory, he ordered the pot to be repleni&s;h|ed, and bade me not permit the acci|dental &s;trokes of misfortune, which vi|&s;ited every man at &s;ome period of his life or another, to ca&s;t me down; at the &s;ame time, pulling out his pur&s;e, he re|que&s;ted me to accept of the loan of a
<PB N="198" REF="204">
few &s;hillings; but this I ab&s;olutely refu|&s;ed, telling him, with great firmne&s;s, that I would &s;ooner put an intire end to my being, than continue to live a bur|den upon fortuitous charity. He cla&s;p|ed my hand in his, and told me that he admired my &s;pirit, but advi&s;ed me not to let it carry me too far; that there was a medium between ra&s;hne&s;s and mean|ne&s;s; and again intreated my accep|tance of his offer; but, on my refu&s;al a &s;econd time, he put his pur&s;e in his pocket, a&s;king me, with a grave air, how I intended to exi&s;t. This que&s;tion made me thoughtful; but I replied, &mdash; "I tru&s;t I &s;hall be able to do that by my indu&s;try: I mean to enquire for &s;ome place." "I &s;uppo&s;e you are not over nice," &s;ays my friend. "No," I replied: "if it will but afford me a
<PB N="199" REF="205">
living, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied, till &s;ome|thing better offers." "Then your be&s;t way," rejoins he, "is to make application to a regi&s;ter-office, and they will direct you to a place imme|diately; the fees of office amount on|ly to a few &s;hillings," added he; &mdash; and, if you will not let me a&s;&s;i&s;t you, you had better leave &s;omething at my uncle's, and he will lend you half-a-crown with the greate&s;t readine&s;s; and you may fetch it away at plea|&s;ure, when you find it convenient." But will not that be taking too great a liberty with your relation?" cried I; "be&s;ides, you know that I am a to|tal &s;tranger to his per&s;on." Here my friend &s;miled, and told me, that the word <HI>uncle</HI> was only a metaphorical ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in common u&s;e among all men
<PB N="200" REF="206">
of the world, and applied to tho&s;e peo|ple who get a convenient livelihood by lending money on pledges; "and you need not have any &s;cruples of delica|cy," cries my friend, "on the &s;core of making u&s;e of their pur&s;e; for they will take pretty good care not to lay you under the &s;malle&s;t obligation to their politene&s;s, or even to their humanity." Upon the &s;trength of this information, I went to a hou&s;e al|mo&s;t oppo&s;ite, and which was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t by the &s;ign of three blue balls; and, entering by a &s;mall door in a dark pa&s;&s;age, I pulled off my wai&s;tcoat, and depo&s;ited it with the man of the &s;hop for two &s;hillings, though it had co&s;t me a guinea but a &s;hort time before, and was not a bit the wor&s;e for wear. However, I pocketed
<PB N="201" REF="207">
the money; and, buttoning my coat from the top to the bottom, I hurried back to my friend, who congratulated me on the dexterity with which I had executed the bu&s;ine&s;s. He having pre|viou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon di&s;charging the reckoning, we parted, extremely well plea&s;ed with each other, and engaging, provided I was not employed in &s;ervice, to dine with him, the following day, at the ordinary where I fir&s;t had the happi|ne&s;s of attracting his notice.</P>
<P>I did not lo&s;e a moment in delay, but went immediately to a regi&s;ter-office that was kept in Holborn. I had &s;carce|ly &s;ignified the intention of my vi&s;it, when the keeper informed me that he had &s;everal places that would &s;uit me exactly, and reque&s;ted me to come in
<PB N="202" REF="208">
the morning, and he would &s;atisfy me more fully in the matter.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the i&s;&s;ue of this adventure, that I went home, and &s;lept that night with unu&s;ual com|fort; but, waking before the hour ap|pointed by the office-keeper for my at|tendance, I lay in bed ruminating upon the happine&s;s that awaited my embra|ces; and, &s;o fondly was I wrapped in the plea&s;ures of the imagination, that I thought I &s;aw Fortune &s;miling upon my wi&s;hes; which elevated my heart &s;o much, that every pul&s;e in my body ac|corded with peace and harmony.</P>

<P>Attend at the office in the morning.&mdash;Di&s;|patched to my new place.&mdash;My reception by the hou&s;ekeeper.&mdash;Pa&s;s an ordeal before my ma&s;ter. &mdash; Approved of, and made happy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE I got up, a thou&s;and plea&s;urable circum&s;tances aro&s;e in my mind, and I had no doubt but I had arrived at the end of my calamities. At la&s;t, hearing the clock give notice, that the long-expected hour of nine was come, I leaped out of bed with uncom|mon &s;prightline&s;s, and &s;urveyed my garret with rapture as I put on my clothes; for tho&s;e objects, that had ap|peared to me di&s;agreeable but the even|ing
<PB N="204" REF="210">
before, wore now a more graceful a&s;pect, &s;o much does the beauty of all exterior objects depend upon the &s;ereni|ty and tincture of the mind.</P>
<P>When I had dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, I &s;allied forth to the temple of Fortune, for &s;uch had my fond fancy pictured the regi&s;ter-office to be; and I did not permit the gra&s;s to grow under my feet in the jour|ney, for I performed it as quick as if the pre&s;ervation of my life depended upon the &s;peed I &s;hould u&s;e in that expedi|tion. I got to the hou&s;e ju&s;t as one of the under&s;trappers of the place was opening the &s;hop for the public accom|modation. When I told him my er|rand, he looked at me with &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e, and &s;aid, it was very lucky that I had not called the family up in the mid|dle of the night; and added, that, for
<PB N="205" REF="211">
his part, he was much obliged to me that I had patience to wait until he had pulled down the fir&s;t &s;hutter. I could not help feeling &s;ome re&s;entment to|wards the author of the&s;e &s;arca&s;tic re|marks upon my eagerne&s;s for employ|ment, but re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s my an|ger at any rate, and not &s;uffer my pa&s;|&s;ions to operate, at &s;o critical a time, to the di&s;advantage of my intere&s;t; &s;o, ap|parently taking all in good part, I &s;at down in the &s;hop to wait until the prin|cipal &s;hould think proper to honour me with his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>During the time of my attendance in the office, a great number of young peo|ple of both &s;exes came in, with &s;ome of whom I entered into conver&s;ation, and learned, from their di&s;cour&s;e, that the hand of nece&s;&s;ity had not been employed
<PB N="206" REF="212">
in oppre&s;&s;ing me alone; but that a con&s;iderable number of other people had received an equal &s;hare of her regard, who perhaps de&s;erved, from their merits, a very different fate.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when my patience was well-nigh exhau&s;ted, the director of the of|fice made his appearance in a morning-gown and a blue velvet cap, and, eye|ing me among the croud of claimants, called me on one &s;ide, and gave me to under&s;tand there was a family, at the we&s;t end of the town, that wanted a &s;er|vant immediately, and that he believed I &s;hould find the place not only ea|&s;y, but comfortable; at the &s;ame time giving me to under&s;tand, that I mu&s;t take this part of his behaviour as an in|&s;tance of his great regard for me, as it was not u&s;ual with him to be &s;o expedi|tious;
<PB N="207" REF="213">
but that he had conceived a li|king for me, from the fir&s;t, from the manner and mode&s;ty of my application, and had determined, in con&s;equence, to lo&s;e no time in &s;ettling me to my ad|vantage. After I had returned him my warme&s;t thanks for his kindne&s;s, I gave him a &s;hilling, and, taking his recom|mendation to the family, I &s;et out in que&s;t of a new place of &s;ervitude with a heart as light as a feather.</P>
<P>When I arrived at the hou&s;e to which I was directed, the door was opened by an old woman, turned of fifty, who &s;eemed to carry about her per&s;on all the dignity and con&s;equence of a hou&s;e|keeper, and I found afterwards that I was not deceived by my conjectures. &mdash; When I told her the nature of my er|rand, &s;he began to que&s;tion me as to my
<PB N="208" REF="214">
age, and if I had ever been in &s;ervice before; to all which interrogatories I gave &s;uch proper an&s;wers, that &s;he deigned to tell me, that &s;he believed I would an&s;wer her ma&s;ter's purpo&s;e, bid|ding me &s;it down in the kitchen until &s;he went up &s;tairs to &s;ee if the old gentle|man was &s;tirring. In this &s;tate I conti|nued for about ten minutes, when a healthy ro&s;y-cheeked wench came into the kitchen; and, under pretence of wiping &s;ome di&s;hes, &s;he took an oppor|tunity of &s;urveying my figure from the corner of her eye, which I imagined &s;he did not think di&s;plea&s;ing; for, turning round, &s;he a&s;ked me, with a &s;mile of ho&s;pitable complai&s;ance, if I would eat any thing that morning, or, if I had an inclination for &s;ome table-beer, &s;he would draw me &s;ome. I returned her
<PB N="209" REF="215">
many acknowledgements for the&s;e in|&s;tances of her good-nature, and one word begot another, till I found my&s;elf inclined to be extremely talkative, from the friendly complexion of her man|ners; and &s;he was in&s;pired with confi|dence from the &s;eeming candour of my di&s;po&s;ition. The fir&s;t que&s;tion &s;he put to me, that &s;avoured of curio&s;ity, and proved her in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the true fe|male &s;pirit, was exactly as follows: <Q>I &s;uppo&s;es you are the young man that I heard old Honour, the hou&s;ekeeper, &s;ay was coming to live in our fami|ly.</Q> To this home thru&s;t I replied, "Yes, I came with that intention, my dear; but whether I &s;hall &s;ucceed or not depends upon the will of the per|&s;on who is to employ me." "Oh! as for that," cries the dam&s;el, "if
<PB N="210" REF="216">
you have the good fortune to be plea&s;ing to Mrs. Honour, my ma&s;ter will take you to-night before to|morrow; for he leaves all them there matters to her." As I thought this was a piece of intelligence well worth attending to, I que&s;tioned the nymph of the kitchen very particularly as to the real &s;ituation of Mrs. Honour; and found that &s;he had lived in the family for many years, and, by her upright conduct and fidelity, had acquired a ve|ry great a&s;cendency over the inclinations of the old gentleman, her ma&s;ter;&mdash; I found, likewi&s;e, from my communica|tive fellow-&s;ervant, that the family con&s;i&s;ted of the old gentleman, and his niece, a beautiful young lady of about eighteen, who was at that time ab&s;ent from the family, on a vi&s;it to a relation
<PB N="211" REF="217">
at Epping-fore&s;t, and who&s;e return was mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed for by the &s;er|vants, as the &s;weetne&s;s of her temper not only charmed all tho&s;e that came near her, but likewi&s;e tended to correct that of the old gentleman, her uncle, who&s;e natural turn of mind partook of too much acidity, when it was not di|verted from its ill-natured pur&s;uits by the per&s;ua&s;ive gentlene&s;s of his amiable niece. Tho&s;e two, with the hou&s;e|keeper, the ruddy la&s;s who entertained me with the family-anecdotes, a hou&s;e|maid, and my&s;elf, formed the dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;hment of this re&s;pectable, though confined, circle.</P>
<P>I was now &s;ummoned by Mrs. Ho|nour, who had come into the kitchen for that purpo&s;e, to follow her up &s;tairs into her ma&s;ter's room&punc; that I might
<PB N="212" REF="218">
undergo &s;uch enquiries as he &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary to make preparatory to my preferment. When we had a&s;cended two pair of &s;tairs, &s;he bade me &s;tay in the landing-place till her ma&s;ter was ready; accordingly &s;he went into an ad|joining chamber, but returned in a few minutes, beckoning me to follow her, and tread as lightly as po&s;&s;ible. I obeyed her directions with &s;uch a palpi|tation of my heart as made me imagine I could even hear its throbbings again&s;t my ribs. When we came to an inner room, I perceived the old gentleman, &s;itting at a table, with a napkin under his chin, and very &s;eriou&s;ly employed in demoli&s;hing a large bowl of bread and milk, which I afterwards under&s;tood to be his daily breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="219">This new ma&s;ter of mine had pa&s;&s;ed his grand climacteric at lea&s;t a dozen years; but, notwith&s;tanding, his a&s;pect was healthy and florid; a large no&s;e, &s;omewhat inclined to the aquiline, part|ed too &s;mall grey eyes, which &s;eemed to twinkle with a&s;perity, and emit the rays of di&s;cord and ill-nature. When he was given to under&s;tand that I waited his plea&s;ure, he took no farther notice than by nodding his head and eating the remainder of his me&s;s with an addi|tional ha&s;te. When he had fini&s;hed his morning's repa&s;t, he threw him&s;elf back in his chair; and, pulling a pair of &s;pectacles from a ca&s;e, he fixed them on his tremendous no&s;e with great delibera|tion, and &s;at looking at me, for a few minutes, with &s;uch circum&s;pective cu|rio&s;ity, as if he intended to mea&s;ure the
<PB N="214" REF="220">
exact altitude of my per&s;on. During this critical &s;urvey of the grey-headed &s;enior, I not only blu&s;hed from ear to ear, but trembled in every limb, le&s;t, on &s;o nice an inve&s;tigation of my figure and appearance, I might be found deficient in the requi&s;ites for a &s;ervant, at lea&s;t in the old gentleman's eyes. But he &s;oon removed tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions, by ob&s;er|ving to his hou&s;ekeeper, that my per&s;on corre&s;ponded with her account, and he had no objection to employ me, provi|ded my character were unexceptionable. At this declaration, I pulled the lieu|tenant's letter from my pocket, and was eagerly going to pre&s;ent it to the old man for his peru&s;al; but he &s;eem|ed to retreat from my endeavour, with an ob&s;ervation, that I need not be in &s;uch a devili&s;h hurry; and, turning to

his hou&s;ekeeper, "Why, Honour," &s;ays he, <Q>this lad you have brought me &s;eems as much tran&s;ported at the idea of eating a good dinner as a hungry poet at a twelve-penny ordinary.

<P>I was humming over to my&s;elf a fa|vourite tune of old Carolan, the Iri&s;h bard, when I ob&s;erved a croud of people on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the way; and, be|ing
<PB N="218" REF="224">
willing to know the cau&s;e that had brought &s;o motley a collection of beings together, I cro&s;&s;ed the way, and found one half of the audience li&s;tening with great attention to the exhortations of a man who &s;tood with his back towards me, and the other half indulging them|&s;elves in exce&s;&s;ive laughter, &s;eemingly at the expence of the apo&s;tle who addre&s;&s;ed them, for I &s;oon learned, from the ten|dency of his di&s;cour&s;e, that it turned entirely upon religious topics; but how was I &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, when the preacher turned round, and I di&s;co|vered him to be the very identical man, who had given me &s;uch excellent admo|nitions, for my future conduct in life, but a few days before, in St. James's park, and who had left me in a great hurry to &s;ettle a political di&s;pute that

uttering &s;uch a confounded lie) I told the good man, without he&s;itation, that I had peru&s;ed it with great attention, and had no doubt but I &s;hould live the bet|ter, and become the happier, for being acquainted with its contents.

But the whole group was &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed by the arrival of the boy's ma&s;ter, who had been informed of his delay by another of his apprentices; and, heated with anger, he tore the young pro&s;elyte away from the embraces of the well-meaning reformer of man|ners, whom he honoured with the mo&s;t opprobrious epithets for detaining his lawful apprentice from his duty; and,

after beating the lad in a mo&s;t unmerci|ful manner, he began to pelt my friend with the filth of the &s;treet without cere|mony, in which agreeable pa&s;time he was joined by the greater part of the mob; and, in &s;pite of all my endea|vours to the contrary, by an unlucky manoeuvre of the enemy, they fairly drove us from the field; for, ju&s;t as the major, regardle&s;s of their &s;houts, was exerci&s;ing his lungs, in a mo&s;t vocife|rous and thundering tone, to bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;conduct, and to put them in the path of righteou&s;ne&s;s, he received an untimely as well as un&s;a|voury &s;alute, from the foe, of a large handful of mud, which, &s;triking him with great force exactly in the mouth, which he had opened, with great ener|gy, as wide as a &s;mall oven, put a final

period to my friend's elocution, by en|tirely &s;topping up that nece&s;&s;ary aper|ture, and thereby rendering the organs of &s;peech totally u&s;ele&s;s.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN I had left my apo&s;tolic preceptor, I was ruminating up|on &s;ome &s;cheme to fill up my time till the hour of dinner; and, wandering by a book&s;eller's &s;hop, I &s;topped to peru&s;e &s;ome loo&s;e pamphlets that lay &s;cattered on the window, when I ob&s;erved a &s;mart well-dre&s;&s;ed man, ogling through his gla&s;s at &s;ome ladies that were cro&s;&s;ing the way. It was not long before I re|collected
<PB N="228" REF="234">
the very identical features of the facetious count, who had played &s;o many pranks with my vanity at the ex|pence of my pur&s;e. I &s;tood for &s;ome time &s;urveying him with great accuracy, that I might be certain of committing no mi&s;take in the bu&s;ine&s;s; for he was &s;o metamorpho&s;ed by his dre&s;s, that I &s;hould not readily have known him again, but for a peculiar &s;martne&s;s of air and cock of the hat that characteri&s;ed all his movements. The moment that I was convinced he was my man, I walked up to him with a &s;tern and determined manner, to claim not only the money he had &s;o ingeniou&s;ly borrowed of me, but likewi&s;e &s;atisfaction for the injuries and &s;hame I had experienced by his artful manoeuvres.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="235">When I had approached him, I gave him a hearty &s;lap on the &s;houlder, which &s;eemed to &s;et his whole nervous &s;y&s;tem in commotion, an effect that did not &s;o much proceed from the violence of the blow as the particular place to which it was applied. He turned immediately round, as I imagined to thank the per|&s;on who had be&s;towed &s;o great a mark of their e&s;teem upon him; and, perceiving me, he exclaimed, with a &s;mile, "Aye, aye, my dear fellow, is it you? &mdash; damme, it is well it is no wor&s;e; I thought it was &s;ome diabolical under|&s;trapper, deputed from the inchanted ca&s;tles about Shire-lane to drag me into limbo at the de&s;ire of &s;ome vile unhallowed ra&s;cal of a tailor, who, not having the fear of decency before his eyes, had i&s;&s;ued a writ, by the
<PB N="230" REF="236">
L&mdash;d, to abridge my privileges of action; but, damme, I have met with an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e. Give me your hand, my gay fellow," conti|nues the count; "you &s;hall dine with me to-day up to your ears in clover. I know an excellent hou&s;e; &mdash; beef-&s;teaks and porter fit for a prince! &mdash; Be&s;ides there is the widow Lamb, a mon&s;trous good-natured gentlewo|man, who keeps a hou&s;e of entertain|ment, for hungry gentlemen, in Ox|ford-road; I will introduce you to her acquaintance; damme, any thing to &s;erve a friend. The captain is on|board the &s;loop," cries the count, &s;lapping his thigh; "and, by the im|mortal powers, it &s;hall be your own fault if you want for any thing."</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="237">"I tell you what, Mr. Count," re|plied I with a &s;erious air; "I mu&s;t in|form you that you have mi&s;taken your man mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly. It is true, I have formerly &s;uffered my&s;elf to be made a complete a&s;s; but that is now over; and, what is more, &s;ir, I in|&s;i&s;t upon immediate reparation." I would have proceeded farther, had he not &s;topped my harangue by indulging an ex|ce&s;&s;ive fit of laughter; at the conclu&s;ion of which he cried out, in disjointed &s;en|tences,&mdash;"Oh! damme, this is fine;&mdash; good,&mdash;very good, by Ch&mdash;t. Excu&s;e my laughing, my dear friend," conti|nued the beau; "but I can't avoid it; I can't, upon my &s;oul. This is too much; but, damn it, you cannot be &s;erious." "Yes, &s;ir, but I am," replied I, and &s;trutted up to him with
<PB N="232" REF="238">
my arms a-kimbo. "No, no, I know better," rejoins the count; "you are not &s;erious, and, what is more, you do not intend to be &s;erious." &mdash; Yes, but I do, &s;ir," replied I. &mdash; Oh! no, you don't,' added he; why, zounds! man, if you were &s;e|rious, I would not keep you compa|ny; I have a mortal aver&s;ion to &s;e|rious men; and you mu&s;t laugh now; come, I know you will, if it is only to oblige me." Whether it aro&s;e from my admiration of his impudence, or that the plea&s;antne&s;s of his features (for he had habitually a &s;mile) attuned my heart to forgivene&s;s and philan|thropy, I cannot tell; but he certainly hit upon the only po&s;&s;ible mode there was of di&s;arming my re&s;entment; and, before I had time to rally the daemons
<PB N="233" REF="239">
of revenge to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he took me under the arm, and, forcing me along the &s;treet, cocked his gla&s;s, and &s;aluted every well-dre&s;&s;ed man or woman we met, not one of whom, however, thought proper to return the compli|ment; and amu&s;ed him&s;elf in this man|ner, without paying the mo&s;t di&s;tant at|tention to me or my remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>We had not walked very far before he gave me an in&s;tance of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a goodne&s;s of heart that would have done honour to a bi&s;hop. A poor woman &s;at upon the cold &s;tones, at the corner of an alley, with two children in her lap, &s;oliciting charity from accidental pa&s;&s;engers. Mi&s;ery and hunger were &s;trongly depicted in her face; the com|plexion of her poor infants was &s;icklied over with the pale hand of famine; and
<PB N="234" REF="240">
the tattered ve&s;tments, that barely &s;er|ved to cover one half of her body, and an&s;wer the rigid purpo&s;es of delicacy, were ragged, filthy, and unwhole&s;ome. In this woe-begone &s;tate did the &s;ilent mourner &s;it, for her tongue &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the faculty of telling the &s;orrow that was &s;o eloquently delivered from her eyes; and, with an extended arm, to receive the benevolent offerings of the good and worthy, &s;he reclined, as one "pining in thought,
<Q><L>"With green and yellow melancholy,</L>
<L>"And looked like Patience,</L>
<L>"On a monument, &s;miling at grief."</L></Q></P>
<P>When this wretched &s;pectacle fir&s;t caught the count's attention, he pulled me by the arm, and pointing to the mi|&s;erable group, broke forth in the fol|lowing apo&s;trophe: "There," &s;aid he,

of practi&s;ing it him&s;elf; and the prude, valuing her&s;elf upon the pre&s;ervation of that cha&s;tity which never was be|&s;ieged, in&s;tead of giving a piece of money for the relief of a &s;ickly fe|male, to&s;&s;es her head, and wonders &s;uch harlots &s;hould be encouraged, by the ill-timed bounty of incon&s;i|derate people, to live in idlene&s;s and get ba&s;tards. In this &s;train," conti|nues the count, "do they comment upon the variegated mi&s;eries of &s;uch objects as the&s;e, when none of their remarks, it is highly probable, are founded either in charity or truth. &mdash; That poor woman," added he, "is the widow of a man of honour and under&s;tanding, whom I knew well. He came over from Ireland, a few years &s;ince, in the hope of mending
<PB N="237" REF="243">
his fortune; but, poor gentleman! he experienced a &s;ad rever&s;e; and, falling into misfortunes in a &s;trange country, it &s;peedily broke his heart, and he left that di&s;con&s;olate woman pregnant with the&s;e children, who are twins. After the decea&s;e of her hu&s;band, &s;he contrived to eke out a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the donations of her late hu&s;band's friends; &mdash; but, that precarious channel having long &s;ince been dried up, &s;he is now obli|ged to beg her bread in the manner you behold, for the circum&s;tance of her having drawn her fir&s;t breath in our &s;i&s;ter-kingdom entirely deprives her of receiving any benefit from a workhou&s;e, and throws her upon the humanity of the public, who&s;e gene|ral &s;entiments, in regard to &s;uch chil|dren
<PB N="238" REF="244">
of calamity as &s;he is, I have paint|ed to your imagination with, I am afraid, too accurate a pencil.</Q></P>
<P>Here the count pulled out his pur&s;e, and took a crown-piece from among a parcel of money, and, walking up to the object of his di&s;cour&s;e, put it into her hand, which he &s;queezed with &s;ome fervour; and, calling upon God to ble&s;s her, left her, rather precipitately, to wonder at the benevolence of a di&s;&s;ipa|ted man, who&s;e heart, not being &s;teeled by the rigorous laws of prudence, or in|fluenced by her narrow, &s;aving, &s;elfi&s;h, doctrines, was tremblingly alive to the nece&s;&s;ities of human nature.</P>
<P>This noble behaviour of the count not only obliterated the remembrance of our former tran&s;actions, but rai&s;ed him to &s;uch a pitch in my e&s;teem, that I

verily believe I would have encountered any hard&s;hip to have &s;erved a man of &s;o exalted a way of thinking.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AGREEABLE to my appointment with the major, I got up early, and dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with as much neat|ne&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, to an&s;wer two purpo&s;es: in the fir&s;t place, to breakfa&s;t with my military friend; and in the &s;econd, to appear as decent as I could upon my entrance to my new &s;ituation.</P>
<P>When I arrived at the major's lod|gings, in the neighbourhood of St.
<PB N="242" REF="248">
James's, I was &s;hewn up &s;tairs by a de|cent orderly-looking woman, and found, on my entrance into the apartment, that &s;everal per&s;ons were attending there for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing the major: among the re&s;t was a lady, whom I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected to be a <HI>fille de joye;</HI> a &s;trange repul&s;ive-looking man, in a ru&s;ty black coat, with a bu&s;hy wig, and a remarka|ble ca&s;t in his left eye, the &s;ight of which was almo&s;t buried in his no&s;e; and a de|crepid old woman, who was almo&s;t bent double with the weight of age. While we &s;at there waiting for the major, &s;eve|ral others came in; and, among the re&s;t, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to recogni&s;e the face of Captain Bli&s;&s;et, the gentleman whom I formerly mentioned as having met in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. His &s;urprize at meeting me was to the full as great as
<PB N="243" REF="249">
mine. After congratulating me upon my happine&s;s in being known to the ma|jor, he informed me, that he was the very gentleman to who&s;e kindne&s;s both him&s;elf and his family had been &s;o much indebted, and towards whom he had exerci&s;ed &s;uch a diabolical &s;pirit of ran|cour while on the &s;ame &s;ervice in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>A farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject was now prevented by the major's entering the chamber. The moment he &s;aw me, he ran up and embraced me, and I was pre&s;ented to the company as a young man to whom he con&s;idered him&s;elf greatly indebted; then he related the hi&s;tory of our affair with the chimney-&s;weeper, and its di&s;agreeable i&s;&s;ue. &mdash; While the major was pronouncing this eulogium in my favour, the people in
<PB N="244" REF="250">
the room eyed me with great attention and re&s;pect; but particularly the cap|tain, who &s;eemed extremely delighted that I &s;hould have taken &s;o active a part in defence of &s;o worthy a character.</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t apparatus being all placed in order, we were &s;ummoned by our good ho&s;t to the table, who made us follow him in his truly-laudable cu&s;|tom of kneeling down and repeating &s;ome prayers preparatory to our repa&s;t; in the performance of which, he &s;hewed as much zeal for the honour of his Sa|viour, and re&s;pect for the canons of hea|ven, as e'er a ruby-faced pa&s;tor in the three kingdoms; but the mo&s;t beautiful feature in the major's portrait, and in which he differed very materially from the reverend gentlemen in que&s;tion, was, &mdash; that he con&s;tantly illu&s;|trated

and enforced his precepts by his example. When that part of the morning duty was fini&s;hed, he performed the honours of his table with the polite|ne&s;s of a gentleman and the ho&s;pitality of an Iri&s;hman, (for I under&s;tood, from his own declaration, that he was a na|tive of that kingdom,) mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly endeavouring to render our &s;ituation as completely happy as po&s;&s;ible; and his demeanour, &s;o far from being &s;oured by his religious attachments, was at once open, frank, chearful, and benevolent.</P>
<P>When the breakfa&s;t was over, he gave audience to his vi&s;itors in an inner room, to which they all retired one by one, as the major &s;ignified his wi&s;hes. When they were all gone, the good man came into the room where I had remained, and apologi&s;ed to me for his ab&s;ence by
<PB N="246" REF="252">
making me acquainted with the leading features of their &s;everal characters, and the general intent of his conver&s;ation with them all; by which I found, that my conjectures relative to the young lady were true; that the old woman had for|merly kept a hou&s;e of ill fame in the neighbourhood of Covent-garden, but had been converted from a continuance of her meretricious practices by the ma|jor's exhortations, who found her in Bridewell beating hemp for the good of &s;ociety; that the man with an oblique vi&s;ion was formerly one of the greate&s;t reprobates about town, but, being &s;ent to the county-jail for debt, was enlarged by his creditors at the interce&s;&s;ion of the major, who took upon him&s;elf a part of his pecuniary obligations, on a &s;olemn pro|mi&s;e, from the pri&s;oner, that he would

follow his coun&s;els and purify his con|duct in future. The major was now proceeding to a panegyric on the cap|tain; but I interrupted his narrative by informing him of our conver&s;ation in the abbey. My friend frankly declaring, that his time was not his own, he having long &s;ince re&s;igned it to the &s;ervice of the public, I took that as a hint for my de|parture, and wi&s;hed him a good morn|ing, but not before he had embraced me in a mo&s;t affectionate manner, and promi&s;ed to remember me particularly in his prayers, which he &s;hould daily of|fer to the throne of mercy for my felici|ty; and, if prayers from &s;o incorrupti|ble a heart as his could not be effectual, I tremble for the authority of a prelate.</P>
<P>I now hurried to my new place, and found every thing prepared for my re|ception

I was &s;oon given to under&s;tand, by my fellow-&s;ervant in the kitchen, that our family had been increa&s;ed, &s;ince my departure, by Mi&s;s Je&s;&s;e, my ma&s;ter's niece, who had re|turned home from her annual vi&s;it; and, by the favourable account I heard from Peggy, (for that was the name of the good-humoured wench in que&s;tion,) I was enamoured with the young lady's character before I &s;aw her per&s;on; but it was not long before I had an opportunity of being an eye-witne&s;s to tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;ti|ble charms which had attracted my no|tice &s;o much in the de&s;cription.

<P><PB N="249" REF="255">I was in the act of placing the la&s;t knife and fork, when the young lady entered the room; and, at the fir&s;t glance I caught of her per&s;on, I was &s;o tran&s;|ported with an unde&s;cribable emotion, that I &s;tood for &s;ome minutes motionle&s;s and incapable of fulfilling my duty.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE per&s;onal graces of Mi&s;s Je&s;&s;e, added to the amiable complexion of her mind, had made &s;uch an indeli|ble impre&s;&s;ion on my heart, that I be|came unhappy out of her &s;ight. Indeed the idea of her charms was continually &s;tepping between me and my peace, and I was ridiculous enough to &s;igh for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that, which Fortune had placed infinitely beyond my reach. In this melancholy &s;tate I wandered about
<PB N="252" REF="258">
the hou&s;e, &s;ometimes like a being lo&s;t to him&s;elf, meditating upon a &s;ubject that was hourly preying on my &s;pirits, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope to bear me up again&s;t &s;o much inquietude; but, &s;o little are our inclinations within the go|vernment of our own power, that I am perfectly convinced we are frequently doomed to be involuntarily mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>I had not been a fortnight in my new place before I had every rea&s;on to believe I had made a conque&s;t of my fellow-&s;ervant, Peggy, who&s;e attentions to me in every thing, accompanied by certain love-fraught &s;miles, left me no room to doubt about the the nature of her de|&s;ires. But I was too much ab&s;orbed in reflecting upon the charms of the mi&s;|tre&s;s to pay the lea&s;t regard to the wiles and witcheries of the maid; and my
<PB N="253" REF="259">
pa&s;&s;ion for that divine creature became at la&s;t &s;o trouble&s;ome, that my nights were &s;leeple&s;s and my days were wretch|ed; &s;he exi&s;ted in my imagination when I was awake, and haunted my dreams when I wi&s;hed for re&s;t. I had re&s;olved a hundred times, in the moments of madne&s;s, to throw my&s;elf at her feet, di&s;clo&s;e my pa&s;&s;ion, and then quit her &s;ight for ever; but the terrors, which hung about the la&s;t part of the re&s;olu|tion, con&s;tantly defeated the advantages of the fir&s;t; and in this &s;tate of uncer|tainty and di&s;quiet, I pa&s;&s;ed my melan|choly hours, until my very exi&s;tence became intolerable.</P>
<P>One evening, having retired to my room, to indulge in &s;ecret the &s;orrows of my heart, I took up a pen, and diverted my&s;elf with writing the following ver&s;es:

<Q><L>Though hope, like coquettes, often plays with the heart,</L>

The im|po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a circum&s;tance taking place left me bewildered in doubts and uncertainties; however, I was relieved

from all farther conjectures, as to the author of the ver&s;es, on the following evening.</P>
<P>Some young ladies and gentlemen having formed a party for Vauxhall-gardens, in which they had engaged my incomparable and charming Je&s;&s;e to ac|company them, I was ordered by my ma&s;ter to attend at the door of the gar|dens, at a particular hour, to wait upon her home. As this was a &s;ervice I would have preferred to the honour of attend|ing even royalty it&s;elf, and in which I chearfully could have &s;pent my exi&s;t|ence, I needed no monitor to &s;pur me to my duty, but was ready at lea&s;t two hours before the time appointed, wait|ing, at the grand avenue to the gardens, with the utmo&s;t anxiety, for a &s;ight of her, who&s;e pre&s;ence would have
<PB N="260" REF="266">
cheared me even in the bo&s;om of a wil|derne&s;s. At length &s;he approached, all charming as &s;he was, and dre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch an elegant neatne&s;s, that &s;he ap|peared like another Venus attired with elegance at the toilet of the graces. It being determined, by her party, to re|turn to town by water, as it was a re|markably fine night, I was di&s;patched to procure a boat in readine&s;s again&s;t their arrival at the &s;tairs; and I execu|ted the commi&s;&s;ion &s;o much to their en|tire &s;atisfaction, that I had the &s;uperla|tive plea&s;ure of hearing the company commend my a&s;&s;iduity and addre&s;s to their fair companion.</P>
<P>When they had all taken their &s;eats under a temporary awning, to &s;hield them from the unwhole&s;ome dews of the night, I entered the boat, and &s;at be|hind

the watermen. Their company con&s;i&s;ted of my mi&s;tre&s;s and two other ladies, an officer in the guards, and a young attorney from the Temple. In this manner we proceeded down the Thames, the party taking it by turns to beguile the time with &s;ongs, and relate tales of mirth, for the mutual entertain|ment of each other. But we had not pa&s;&s;ed beyond the arches of We&s;tmin&s;ter bridge above a hundred yards, before an accident took place, that proved fatal to one of the party, and had nearly in|volved us all in one general de&s;truction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>An accident happens that threatens us with imminent danger. &mdash; A bait for the de|vil. &mdash; My mi&s;tre&s;s makes a declaration of love in my favour.&mdash;My ma&s;ter dies. &mdash; I marry the object of my de&s;ires. &mdash; The infallible &s;ecret to in&s;ure conjugal felicity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE moon, which had &s;hone with &s;uch unu&s;ual brightne&s;s on our fir&s;t &s;etting out, was almo&s;t totally eclip&s;ed by a cloud ere we had performed one half of our voyage, and rendered the ob|jects on the Thames &s;o indi&s;tinct, that our watermen, not looking about them with that caution their duty required, ran again&s;t a coal-barge which was
<PB N="263" REF="269">
moored at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Surry-&s;tairs. The violence of the &s;hock, ad|ded to the &s;udden bu&s;tle of the ladies, who all &s;tarted up in&s;tantaneou&s;ly on the fir&s;t notice of danger, overturned the boat, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of the gentlemen to the contrary. Being a good &s;wimmer, I immediately caught hold of my angelic mi&s;tre&s;s by the arm, but not before her whole body had been immerged in the water, and bore her, in that &s;ituation, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, to the &s;hore. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the watermen, the two ladies, her companions, were &s;aved, and the officer &s;wam to a parcel of tim|ber, that floated conveniently in the neighbourhood of the place where the di&s;a&s;ter happened. By this time, the &s;hrieks of the ladies had drawn &s;everal people to the water-&s;ide, who exerci&s;ed
<PB N="264" REF="270">
every office of humanity in their power. As for the ill-fated limb of the law, though he was heard to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch piteous accents as would have melted a heart of &s;tone, no one could be prevailed upon to go to his relief, until a young man, who was pre&s;ent, &s;trip|ped him&s;elf in a trice to &s;wim to the aid of the unfortunate beau; &mdash; and was ju&s;t preparing to plunge into the &s;tream, when one of the company hap|pened to mention the name of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, which operated like a charm on the di&s;po&s;ition of the humane youth, who no &s;ooner under&s;tood that he was an at|torney, than he very deliberately put on his clothes, prote&s;ting that, as he was a lawyer, he might drown and be damned for him; that, for his part, he would not run the chance of incurring the di&s;|plea&s;ure
<PB N="265" REF="271">
of the devil, by &s;o untimely robbing him of his dues.</P>
<P>When the fair Je&s;&s;e had recovered the u&s;e of her &s;en&s;es, &s;he eagerly en|quired for her deliverer; and, finding that &s;he was indebted for her life to my zeal and activity, &s;he cla&s;ped her dear arms about my neck, and prayed that &s;he might have the ability to expre&s;s her gratitude. I was &s;o overpowered by her conde&s;cen&s;ion, that I remained &s;peech|le&s;s, kneeling at her feet, till, my pa&s;|&s;ion getting the better of my rea&s;on, I &s;eized her hand, and &s;mothered it with ki&s;&s;es. By the gentle manner, in which &s;he rebuked me for this freedom, I fir&s;t di&s;covered that I was not indifferent to her heart; which probably I &s;hould have remained ignorant of as long as I lived, if the decrees of Fate had not
<PB N="266" REF="272">
turned this &s;eeming evil to my good.&mdash; When we returned home, &s;he made me a pre&s;ent of a locket, which &s;he intreat|ed me to keep for ever, as a token of her gratitude and e&s;teem; a pre&s;ent, to me of the mo&s;t ine&s;timable value, for it contained a ringlet of her lovely auburn hair, woven in the &s;hape of a true-lo|ver's knot. On receiving this mark of her favour, I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and, imploring her pardon for my pre|&s;umption, made a full declaration of my pa&s;&s;ion. After this confe&s;&s;ion, I would have retired from her &s;ight, and left the hou&s;e for ever; but, perceiving my in|tention, &s;he called me back, and told me, while her beauteous cheek glowed with a &s;uffu&s;ion of blu&s;hes, that my partiality in her favour had not been a my&s;tery to her for &s;ome time; that &s;he
<PB N="267" REF="273">
could trace it in all my actions, and read it in all my looks: "But," added the divine Je&s;&s;e, <Q>I &s;trove to avoid &s;uch ob&s;ervations as much as po&s;&s;ible; for, in &s;pite of the di&s;tance that fortune has thrown between us, I felt an advo|cate, that pleaded in behalf of your merits, in this brea&s;t, &s;o powerfully, that I was obliged to yield to its &s;oli|citations; and mu&s;t inform you, however painful to my delicacy, that my happine&s;s cannot be more e&s;&s;ential to your peace than yours is to mine.</Q> Here the accompli&s;hed lady turned a&s;ide her head to hide her confu&s;ion, while I poured forth my acknowledgements at her feet in terms of the mo&s;t rapturous gratitude. In &s;hort, we made a full confe&s;&s;ion of our regards for each other, and re&s;olved to embrace the fir&s;t oppor|tunity,
<PB N="268" REF="274">
that Fortune &s;hould offer and Prudence &s;hould countenance, to make our bli&s;s complete. And it was not long before that happened; for, her un|cle being &s;uddenly &s;eized with the gout in his &s;tomach, it carried him off, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of three phy&s;icians, in a few hours; and we had the plea&s;ure to find, that he had left the greater part of his fortune at the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of his niece.</P>
<P>When the cu&s;tomary time had elap|&s;ed, that is pre&s;cribed for people appa|rently to mourn for the lo&s;s of tho&s;e, who&s;e deaths they had hourly prayed for, my Je&s;&s;e and I were led to the &s;acred al|tar of Hymen; and there, performing all due rites and ceremonies, the beau|teous maid was given up to my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion; and I may venture to add, that,
<PB N="269" REF="275">
if every wedded pair experienced as much felicity as we have done &s;ince the my&s;terious and indi&s;&s;oluble knot made us one, the honourable &s;tate of matrimony would no longer furni&s;h food for the pen of &s;atire, or laughter for the faculties of folly, by the ridicu|lous feuds it too frequently engenders; and, gentle reader, to give you a con|vincing proof that I have a proper re|gard for the well-being of my fellow-creatures, I will publicly make known the ine&s;timable &s;ecret, by the ob&s;ervance of which we are &s;o much happier than our neighbours: it is briefly this, &mdash; looking with an eye of kindne&s;s upon the weakne&s;&s;es of each other.</P>
