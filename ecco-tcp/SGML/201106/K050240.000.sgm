<HEAD>De&s;cription of the Figure.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS Figure repre&s;ents a Woman gone eight Months with Child, chained down upon a Ta|ble, &s;uppo&s;ed to be open'd alive, of which the two principal Cavities are laid open, <HI>viz.</HI> the Brea&s;t and the lower Belly, which are divided from each other by the Diaphragm or Midriff. In the Brea&s;t, the Heart which is placed to move for carry|ing on the Circulation is &s;een between the two Lobes of the Lungs, which likewi&s;e move as in Breathing; from the Heart are &s;een going out the two principal Arteries of the Body made of Gla&s;s; the one leading to the Lungs, and the other towards every Part of the Body, <HI>viz.</HI> towards the Head and Arms, whil&s;t the Trunk is continued on the Back Bones through the Brea&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing the Diaphragm into the lower Belly, divides it&s;elf to all its Parts, and then goes to the Legs. The &s;ame Number of Veins made of Gla&s;s accompany the Arteries, join in one Trunk, and open into the Heart again: Through the Arteries a red Liquor, in imitation of Blood, is &s;een to move from the Heart to every Part of the Body, and
<PB N="4" REF="4">by the Veins returning from every Part of the Body to the Heart again. In the lower Belly, in a Cavity called the <HI>Pel|vis</HI> or Ba&s;on, the Child is &s;een in the Womb, with the Af|ter-birth and Navel-&s;tring made of Gla&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of two Arteries and one Vein ari&s;ing from the After-birth by many Branches, which terminate in one of a con&s;iderable Length, and enter the Navel of the Child, through which the Blood is &s;een to pa&s;s, from the Mother for its Nouri&s;hment. The two Arteries are likewi&s;e &s;een to ari&s;e out of the Navel of the Child, twi&s;ted round the Vein in its Cour&s;e towards the After-birth, where it divides it&s;elf into a great Number of Branches, in the &s;ame Manner as the Vein: Thro' the&s;e Arteries the Blood is likewi&s;e &s;een to return from the Child to the Mother after Nouri&s;hment.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Structure of the Heart and Lungs, and of the Circu|lation of the Blood.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to have a right Under&s;tanding of the Circulation of the Blood, it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be acquainted with the Structure of the Heart and Lungs; becau&s;e they are the Or|gans immediately concerned in carrying on that important Function.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Heart.</HEAD>
<P>The Heart is a &s;elf-moving Mu&s;cle of a pyramidal Figure, &s;u&s;pended (in the Middle of the Brea&s;t between the two Lobes of the Lungs) by its principal Ve&s;&s;els being connected to no other Part for the Conveniency of its Motions. Of the Heart
<PB N="5" REF="5">we may con&s;ider the two Extremities; the one is uppermo&s;t and broad, call'd the Ba&s;e; the other is lowermo&s;t, and con|tracting it&s;elf narrow becomes a little &s;harp, and is called its Point: This more &s;o in Brutes. The Situation of the Heart in Man is re&s;ting on the Diaphragm, &s;lanting much towards the left Side, &s;o that the greate&s;t Part of it is placed under the left Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of four principal Cavities, two of which are called Auricles, or Ears, from their Figure, placed on the right and left Sides of the Ba&s;e of the Heart; the two other are the Ventricles, which are Cavities formed immediately in the Sub&s;tance of the Heart: The one is the right Ventricle and the other the left: The right Ear opens into the right Ventricle; and the left Ear into the left Ventricle. The Heart, like all other Mu&s;cles, is made up of a great Number of Fi|bres or fle&s;hy Threads, di&s;po&s;ed in a particular Manner, on the in&s;ide of the Ears, where they form a kind of irregular Net-work, and in the Ventricles, be&s;ides this Net-work, leve|ral con&s;iderable Eminences called Pillars. The right Ear opens into the right Ventricle, and the left into the left Ven|tricle; at the Entrance of the right Ear into the right Ventricle there are placed three Valves, which open from the right Ear into the right Ventricle, but clo&s;e the Return from that Ven|tricle into that Ear: From the left Ear into the left Ventricle there are placed two more, in the &s;ame manner as in the right Ventricle.</P>
<P>There are four principal Ve&s;&s;els which come into and go out of the Heart; two Veins and two Arteries; the two Veins are the <HI>Vena Cava;</HI> or hollow Vein, which is made from the
<PB N="6" REF="6">Union of all the Veins of the Body, and the Pulmonary Vein, made from the Union of all the Veins of the Luags. The <HI>Vena Cava</HI> opens into the right Ear, and the Pulmonary Vein into the left. The two Arteries are, the Pulmonary Artery, which divides it|&s;elf into every Part of the Lungs, and the <HI>Aorta magna,</HI> or great Artery, which divides it&s;elf into every Part of the Body; the Pulmonary Artery ari&s;es out of the right Ventricle, at the Beginning of which there are placed three Valves in the Figure of a Half-moon, which open from the Ventricle into this Ar|tery, but clo&s;e from the Artery into the Ventricle; the <HI>Aorta magna,</HI> or great Artery, ari&s;es out of the left Ventricle, at the Entrance of which there are placed three other Valves of the Half-moon Form, di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame Manner as tho&s;e in the Pulmonary Artery. Be&s;ides the&s;e principal Ve&s;&s;els, there are two Arteries and a Vein appropriated to the U&s;e of the Heart; the Arteries are call'd Coronary; they ari&s;e from the great Ar|tery at its going out of the Heart, and are di&s;tributed through|out the whole Sub&s;tance of the Heart for its Nouri&s;hment; and the Veins bear the &s;ame Name which return the Blood into the right Ear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Lungs.</HEAD>
<P>The Lungs are two in Number, &s;ituate on each Side of the Heart, of an ela&s;tick &s;pungy Texture: They are connected to the Ve&s;&s;els of the Heart and Windpipe, of which they are chiefly compo&s;ed. The Windpipe is the Pa&s;&s;age for Air into the Lungs only; its upper Part is made up of fine &s;mall Car|tilages,
<PB N="7" REF="7">or Gri&s;tles, four of which form its Entrance, which is at the Root of the Tongue, before the Entrance of the Gul|let, and is the Pa&s;&s;age for the Aliments. The Fifth is a car|tilaginous Valve placed at the Entrance of the Windpipe, which is pre&s;&s;ed down at the Time the Aliments are pa&s;&s;ing into the Gullet. The Windpipe is compo&s;ed of many cartilaginous Rings, loo&s;ely connected to each other, in &s;uch a Manner that they may draw one in another: It is placed in the Fore-part of the Neck, and, after its Entrance into the Brea&s;t, divides it&s;elf into two Branches, whereof the one enters the right Lobe of the Lungs, and the other the left: The&s;e Branches divide them|&s;elves throughout the whole Structure of the Lungs, and every where terminate in &s;mall Ve&s;icles or Bladders, which are all tied together by a Number of &s;mall Productions, from the common Covering of the Lungs. The next Ve&s;&s;els are the Pulmonary Arteries and Veins: The Pulmonary Artery divides it&s;elf above the Heart into two Branches, the one to the right and the other to the left Lobe of the Lungs, where they follow all the Divi&s;ions of the Branches of the Windpipe, lay|ing on the Sides of them, and continuing their Cour&s;e 'till they have attained to the &s;mall Ve&s;icles, where they &s;pread them|&s;elves over them in a Number of &s;mall capillary Ve&s;&s;els. From the&s;e &s;mall capillary Arteries on the Ve&s;icles ari&s;e the capillary-pulmonary Veins, which uniting them&s;elves from &s;mall Branches into large, on the Sides of the Branches of the Windpipe, form one Trunk in the left Ear. As the&s;e con&s;i|derable Ve&s;&s;els conduce nothing to the Nouri&s;hment of the Sub&s;tance of the Lungs (as will more particularly be treated of in de&s;cribing the Circulation of the Blood in the Child while
<PB N="8" REF="8">in the Womb) there is a particular Artery for that U&s;e, called the Bronchal Artery, and a Vein to return the Blood.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Circulation of the Blood, and its U&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid of the Structure of the Heart and the Di&s;po&s;ition of its Ve&s;&s;els and Valves, placed at the coming in of the Ventricles from the Ears, as well as of tho&s;e placed at the going out of the Ventricles into the Arteries; if the Action of the Heart be rightly con&s;idered, its U&s;e may be ea&s;ily under|&s;tood; for the Ears and Ventricles have both of them the Power of contracting and dilating them&s;elves. But neither of the&s;e two Actions can happen at the &s;ame time both in the Ears and Ventricles, but the Dilatation of the one mu&s;t &s;ucceed the Con|traction of the other, for rea&s;ons now to be mentioned: For the Blood is always flowing from the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> into the right Ear, and from the Pulmonary Vein into the left, the one from every Part of the Body, and the other from the Lungs. So that the Ears, if rightly con&s;idered, are two little Re&s;ervoirs always ready to &s;upply the Ventricles with a men&s;urated Quantity of Blood, le&s;t its Motion &s;hould be &s;uffocated by the Weight of too much Blood at one time. As to the Ventricles, they are to receive the Blood from the Ears, in given Quantities, in order to force it our of their Cavities into the Arteries; by the Force of the right Ventricle through the Pulmonary Artery into the Lungs, and by the left through the great Artery into every Part of the Body. When the Ears contract, the Ventricles di|late, becau&s;e that the Ventricles at that time are receiving the Blood from them; and when the Ventricles contract, the Ears
<PB N="9" REF="9">dilate, becau&s;e at that time the Blood endeavouring to return in|to the Auricles from the Ventricles pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the Valves, and clo&s;es them; during which time the Auricles are filling and kept dilated: The Blood in the Ventricles, which cannot return into the Auricles, is forced over the Half-moon Valves into the Pulmonary Artery from the right Ventricle, as well as over tho&s;e from the left Ventricle into the great Artery, by which Means the Arteries are dilated and filled with Blood. So that the Dilatation of the Arteries &s;ucceeds the Contraction of the Ventricles; for no Blood can po&s;&s;ibly return from the Ar|teries into the Ventricles, becau&s;e the Half-moon Valves &s;hut up the Mouths of tho&s;e Arteries, whenever the Blood en|deavours to return; and this is the Rea&s;on of the Pul&s;ation of the Arteries. Hence it plainly appears, that the U&s;e of the Heart is to carry on two Circulations of the whole Ma&s;s of Blood at one and the &s;ame time: The one from the right Ventricle through the Lungs to the left Ear, and the other from the left Ventricle through every Part of the Body to the the right Ear. The Manner in which the&s;e Circulations are carry'd on is the next thing to be con&s;idered; And fir&s;t, of that through the Lungs:</P>
<P>The Lungs perform two Actions, that of In&s;piration, and that of Expiration; the fir&s;t is when the Air is taken into the Lungs, and the other is when it is thru&s;t out.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Action is performed by the Means of many Mu&s;cles which rai&s;e the Ribs, and widen the Brea&s;t, during which time the Midriff, from a Convex Surface towards the Brea&s;t, becomes plane; and at the &s;ame time the outward Air, being pre&s;s'd, ru&s;hes in at the No&s;e and Mouth, and pa&s;&s;es through all the Branches of the Wind-pipe, which lead
<PB N="10" REF="10">to the &s;mall Ve&s;icles by which they are blown up. The Rings which compo&s;e the Branches of the Wind-pipe, which be|fore were contracted one within another, are now extended the one from the other; the Branches of the Pulmonary Ar|tery and Vein laying on the Sides of the Branches of the Wind-pipe, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be co-equally extended with them, which before lay in Folds, gives now to the Blood a free Opportunity to pa&s;s from the right Ventricle of the Heart, through all the Ramifications of the Pulmonary Ar|tery, and fill their Capillaries, which are di&s;tributed on the Ve&s;icles: By this time the Elevation of the Ribs cea&s;es, and the antagoni&s;t Mu&s;cles pull them down, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the weight of the external Air, which pre&s;&s;es on their Surface, drives the Air violently out of the Ve&s;icles, through all the Branches of the Wind-pipe; and their Sides being brought together, the Blood contained in the Capillary Ar|teries by this great Pre&s;&s;ure is broken, and its Globules grown &s;o &s;mall, as to be able to pa&s;s in the Capillary Veins, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Pulmonary Veins, from whence it is propelled by the conti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ual Contraction of the Lungs into the left Auricle of the Heart.</P>
<P>Hence we find the great Nece&s;&s;ity of Re&s;piration; for by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Blood in its Pa&s;&s;age through the Lungs undergoes a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iolent Trituration, breaking the Texture of its Globules to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eparate its Parts, by which Means they become di&s;&s;imilar to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ach other, and prepare a &s;ufficient Quantity of different Par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cles for the Nouri&s;hment of the different Parts of the Body, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich is carried on by the &s;econd Circulation from the left Ven|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cle of the Heart through the <HI>Aorta magna,</HI> or great Artery.</P>
<P>The left Ventricle of the Heart has its Sides about four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mes as thick as the right; and nece&s;&s;ary it was it &s;hould
<PB N="11" REF="11">be &s;o; a greater Force being required to drive the Blood through the great Artery into every Part of the Body, than through the Lungs only, which is the U&s;e of the right Ventricle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aorta magna,</HI> or great Artery, is an ela&s;tick cartila|ginous Tube ari&s;ing out of the left Ventricle of the Heart, and divides it&s;elf to every Part of the Body, the Branches of which continue their Divi&s;ion 'till they become &s;o &s;mall as to be as fine as a Hair, and are call'd Capillaries: From the&s;e &s;mall Capillary Arteries ari&s;e another Kind of &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, which are call'd Veins, which frequently unite into larger Branches from every Part of the Body, 'till they have formed one common great Trunk, call'd the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> or great hol|low Vein, which opens it&s;elf into the right Ear of the Heart. The Blood, which has been &s;ufficiently ground and &s;ubtillized by the Action of the Lungs, as was now mentioned, is brought into the left Ear by the Pulmonary Veins. The Cavity of each Ear is capable of containing one Ounce of Blood, &s;o that whenever the left Ear contracts, the great Artery mu&s;t receive one Ounce of Blood, becau&s;e the left Ventricle can throw no more Blood into the great Artery, than what it re|ceives from its Ear. During the Time the great Artery is re|ceiving this Quantity of Blood from the contracting Ventricle, it is much dilated or &s;tretched: But as its Sub&s;tance is in|duced with a great Spring, as &s;oon as the Re&s;i&s;tance is taken off, which is, when the left Ventricle dilates to receive a fre&s;h Quantity of Blood from the left Ear, then the Artery con|tracts it&s;elf, by which Means the Blood is crowded into its Ca|vity, and clo&s;ely embraced and pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t its Sides; the Blood at the &s;ame Time equally re&s;i&s;ting every Way, pre&s;&s;es
<PB N="12" REF="12">again&s;t the Half-moon Valves, and prevents its Return into the left Ventricle, and thus is obliged to pa&s;s on thro' all the Ramifications of this Artery into every Part of the Body.</P>
<P>During the Time that the Artery is contracting to propel the the Blood into every Part of the Body, the left Ventricle is di|lating to receive another Quantity of Blood from the left Ear, in order to throw it into the great Artery again, by the Time that the Contraction of its Sides are over.</P>
<P>Thus by the alternate Dilatation and Contraction of the left Auricle and left Ventricle, the Blood, which returns from the Lungs, where it has been attenuated and rendered fit for the Nouri&s;hment of the different Parts of the Body, is &s;ent by the great Artery to be di&s;tributed to them, whil&s;t the excre|mentitious Parts are &s;trained off by particular Glands, and carried out of the Body by Sweat and other Evacuations: The remaining Part of the Blood, which has not been &s;uffi|ciently ground by the Action of the Lungs, is taken up by the Veins, and brought back to the <HI>Cava,</HI> to be poured by the right Auricle into the right Ventricle, in order to be forced through the Lungs again, and there to undergo another Tri|turation, and afterwards to be di&s;tributed to every Part of the Body again, in the Manner it has already been de&s;cribed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Nouri&s;hment of the Child in the Womb.</HEAD>
<P>During the Time that the Child is in the Womb, it is nouri&s;hed with Blood only, brought to it from the <HI>Placenta,</HI> or After-birth, through the Navel by the umbilical Rope or Navel-&s;tring; but as there is always more Blood conveyed to it than is nece&s;&s;ary for its Nouri&s;hment, there is a con&s;tant Return of this Blood through the Navel-&s;tring to the After|birth again.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="13">
<P>Therefore to have a right Under&s;tanding in what Manner this reciprocal Circulation is carried on, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider the Child, during the Time it is in the Womb, to be precluded from all Communication with the outward Air, and cannot breathe, all the Ve&s;icles or little Bladders of its Lungs being clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed together, and the Extremities of the Pul|monary Arteries and Veins equally pre&s;&s;ed with them, &s;o that the Cour&s;e of the Blood through the Lungs is entirely &s;topp'd 'till Birth; and notwith&s;tanding that the Circulation of the Blood may be conveniently carried on (there are particu|lar Pa&s;&s;ages left open) without ever pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Lungs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages is called <HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> which is an oval Hole opening from the right Ear of the Heart in|to the left, where there is a Valve &s;hutting from the left Ear into the right. The &s;econd is a Canal of Communication, called <HI>Ductus arterio&s;us,</HI> which from the Trunk of the Pulmonary Artery opens into the Trunk of the <HI>Aorta magna,</HI> or great Artery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Placenta,</HI> or After-birth, is a large Ma&s;s of Blood-Ve&s;&s;els like a Cake, compo&s;ed of Arteries and Veins, by the Extremities of which it is fa&s;tened to the inward Surface of the Womb, &s;o that the Extremities of the Arteries of the Womb are joined to tho&s;e of the Veins of the <HI>Placenta,</HI> and the Extre|mities of the Arteries of the <HI>Placenta</HI> to tho&s;e of the Veins the Womb, by which Means the maternal Blood, by the Ar|teries of the Womb, is tran&s;mitted into the Veins of the <HI>Pla|centa,</HI> which Veins unite into one con&s;iderable one in the mid|dle of the <HI>Placenta,</HI> about an Ell long, which enters the Navel of the Child, pa&s;&s;ing through the Fi&s;&s;ure of the Liver, and
<PB N="14" REF="14">opens in the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> to bring the Blood in the right Ear; one Part of this Blood pa&s;&s;es through the <HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> or oval Hole, into the left Ear; the two Ears contracting them|&s;elves force the Blood in the right and left Ventricle of the Heart, &s;o that the Blood contained in the left Ventricle is for|ced up the great Artery, and that in the right up the Pulmo|nary: This Blood finding no Pa&s;&s;age through the Lungs pa&s;&s;es the Canal of Communication, and mixes it&s;elf with the Blood of the left Ventricle in the great Artery, by which it is &s;ent to every Part of the Body of the Child for its Nouri&s;hment: The remaining Quantity of Blood, which is not employed in nouri&s;hing the Child, returns by two Arteries, which come out at the Navel of the Child, and are convoluted about the Vein, which three Ve&s;&s;els compo&s;e the Navel-&s;tring. The Ar|teries, having reached the After-birth, divide into an infinite Number of Ramifications, who&s;e &s;malle&s;t Branches unload them&s;elves of their Blood into the Veins of the Womb of the Mother. Thus the Child is continually nouri&s;hed during the Time that it is contained in the Womb, and the Circulation carried on without ever pa&s;&s;ing through the Lungs.</P>
<P>But after the Child is born, the Air finding a Pa&s;&s;age into its Lungs, blows up all the Ve&s;icles; by which Means the Pre&s;&s;ure is taken off from the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els; at which Time, the Blood in the right Ventricle finding a free Pa&s;&s;age through the Pulmonary Artery into the Lungs, pa&s;&s;es no more through the Duct of Communication, but returns, by the Pulmonary Vein, into the Left, and beating again&s;t the Valve of the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> for ever clo&s;es it up.</P>
