<P>I Have peru&s;ed a Pamphlet entitled, <HI>Some Rea&s;ons why the Practice of Inoculation ought to be introduced into the Town of</HI> Bury <HI>at Pre&s;ent,</HI> and have been &s;urprized to find this elaborate Piece &s;o little in Sub&s;tance, and &s;o lit|tle to the Purpo&s;e: In&s;omuch that at the fir&s;t, I determined on|ly to point out, and expo&s;e the Mi&s;takes of it in Conver&s;ation, being under a full Per&s;wa&s;ion and Conviction, that the Author would <HI>Triumph neither a Week nor a Day,</HI> but that the Pro|ject <HI>would</HI> very &s;oon <HI>end in Confu&s;ion.</HI> Being &s;ince reminded of a warm Re&s;olution made by me, to oppo&s;e any Efforts to re|vive a Practice &s;o ju&s;tly exploded and condemned by all rational Men, I have changed my Mind, and &s;et Pen to Paper; but if a Promi&s;e to an&s;wer an Author before I knew the weight and Strength of his Arguments, may be by <HI>&s;ome</HI> thought Ra&s;hne&s;s and Prejudice, I hope an Abhorrence I have of a Practice &s;o cruel, un&s;afe, and uncertain to Mankind, an impartial Con&s;i|deration and full Acquaintance of what has been advanced pro and con, and a great Diffidence of the Author's Abilities to &s;upport it, may to <HI>others</HI> clear me from the Imputation of Ra&s;hne&s;s and Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS barbarous and dangerous Invention was about 10 Years pa&s;t imported at <HI>London</HI> from <HI>Turkey;</HI> the Curio&s;ity like many other <HI>foreign</HI> Mon&s;ters plea&s;ed at fir&s;t, but &s;oon after grew un|governable by it's own Ma&s;ters, and when let loo&s;e, made great Havock and Slaughter. But after all the Difficulties and Di&s;|appointments,
<PB N="4" REF="2">it was endeavoured to be buoy'd up by <HI>able</HI> Hands which undertook to prove that this <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Method of Inoculation, might &s;afely and &s;ecurely be practi&s;ed in our Cli|mate and upon our Con&s;titutions, and that a <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Impiety of bringing Di&s;ea&s;es upon our&s;elves was reconcileable to a Chri|&s;tian Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>BUT in &s;pight of all &s;uch Aids, and Supports, it daily &s;unk into di&s;u&s;e and contempt, and of late has &s;carce been menti|oned among&s;t Us, till our Author on a reliance of his mathe|matical Skill, and a thorough Acquaintance with the Doctrine of Chances, undertook to &s;trike a new Light, to open our Eyes, and by plain and ea&s;y Calculations, to evince the Rea&s;on|ablene&s;s and Security of it, <HI>even to a Demon&s;tration.</HI></P>
<P>VAIN Delu&s;ion! For if many have died in <HI>London,</HI> when the Inci&s;ions were made by the mo&s;t skillful Hands, and under the Care and Direction of the mo&s;t Eminent <HI>Regular</HI> Phy&s;icians What (may we &s;uppo&s;e) will be the Con&s;equence? What a Tra|gic Scene &s;hall we have? when this Practice &s;hall be brought into the Country, and committed to common Hands, Men of le&s;s Abilities and no Experience; but from hence it appears, <HI>Providence has given &s;ome Per&s;ons Heads to contrive, and Hands to execute any thing that will &s;erve their own Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to proceed to my Undertaking of an An&s;wer, which I &s;hall do by giving my Opinion of the Tract in general, and then make &s;ome Remarks upon the Ob&s;ervations, Calculations, and Arguments in particular.</P>
<P>IN the general View I ob&s;erve three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. A &s;pecious Pretext of a tender Concern for the Detri|ment of all Trade, and <HI>perhaps lo&s;s of A&s;&s;izes, Se&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="5" REF="3">Fairs, and other publick Meetings,</HI> which is a popular Argu|ment to the Trade&s;men of the Town. But here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this Practice was endeavoured to be introduced, when only a Per&s;on or two had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> when the variolous Matter was to be purcha&s;ed at a <HI>dear</HI> Rate, and all the Trade&s;men were very active and vigilant, to prevent its &s;preading. How|ever 'twas very nece&s;&s;ary that this artful Addre&s;s to the Popu|lace, &s;hould appear glittering at the Top to engage their At|tention, but unluckily <HI>Self-&s;erving</HI> pops up in the Middle, and <HI>Self-regard</HI> lurks and skulks at the Bottom. But this is not the only In&s;tance of his Fondne&s;s of being thought <HI>Some|body,</HI> for the Reader mu&s;t be acquainted with his Conver&s;ation with Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> at the Coffee-hou&s;e, and his Corre&s;pondence with Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI> when he was at <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HIS Submi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Paper to the Cler|gy</HI> is re&s;pectful, but de&s;igning, and perhaps the Gentlemen of that Order are very little oblig'd to him for his Compliment, for I am very much mi&s;taken if many of them are not able to give more Rea&s;ons than are founded upon a Suppo&s;ition that the Practice does not <HI>promote our Lives, Healths, and Hap|pine&s;s,</HI> but in Ca&s;ui&s;try are convinced that the Practice is pre|&s;umptious and &s;inful; but as to the Morality of it, &s;hall refer him to tho&s;e Gentlemen he &s;hall have the Honour to have farther Conver&s;e with.</P>
<P N="3">3. I OBSERVE his Arguments are old, &s;tale, and borrow'd, and that he has cho&s;e <HI>&s;ome Rea&s;ons</HI> out of many, very injudi|ciou&s;ly; for he has offer'd the Weake&s;t and left the mo&s;t Enfor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing. Does this ill Choice proceed from want of Judgment? To pre&s;ume that, by his Friends would be interpreted a Weak|ne&s;s of my own; I will rather then imagine that he writes with great Cunning and Policy, and has been taught by &s;ome military Man a &s;tratagem in War, <HI>viz.</HI> To place &s;ometimes the weake&s;t of his Forces in the Front, and &s;pare his brave&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="4">Men to do the mo&s;t Execution, for which Rea&s;on, and under which Caution, I &s;hall re&s;erve my Veterans till we come to a clo&s;er Engagement.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed to con&s;ider his Ob&s;ervations, Calculations, and Arguments in particular.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ART. I.P. 3.</HI></BIBL> If Inoculation was generally practi&s;ed&mdash; we need not have it &s;ix Months.</Q>
<P>IF this Limitation of the Small Pox to &s;ix Months be true it mu&s;t be &s;o, becau&s;e by an Elegancy of Stile, the Author can per&s;wade all the Timorous to undergo an Operation they think dangerous, and by his Ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;try can prevail upon the Scrupulous to enter upon an Action they believe Sinful, and can be &s;ecure upon Inoculation of producing any variolous Symptoms and Pu&s;tules, and be&s;ides all this has by his irrefraga|ble Arguments, proved a general Inoculation an infallible Pre|&s;ervative again&s;t the Di&s;temper in a natural Way. Now if I could imagine this to be Fact, yet I would not dare to a&s;&s;ert and fix &s;o exact a Time as <HI>of &s;ix Months</HI> for its Continuance. But I am fully a&s;&s;ured he has not removed the Apprehen&s;ions of the Fearful, or &s;atisfied the Doubts of the Con&s;cientious, nor even promi&s;ed to produce the Di&s;temper by Inoculation in every Ca&s;e, nor given good Rea&s;ons of &s;ecurity again&s;t the Small Pox in a natural Way after Inoculation; to &s;ay then we need not have it <HI>&s;ix Months,</HI> is downright Arrogance and Pre&s;umption.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ART. II.P. 3.</HI></BIBL> As the utmo&s;t Hazard of dying of the ino|culated Small Pox appears by the la&s;t authentic Ac|counts, to be no more than that of <HI>1</HI> in <HI>50,</HI> and by the &s;ame Accounts, that of dying of the Natural is &s;hewn to be that of <HI>1</HI> in <HI>6.</HI></Q>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P>IN this Article our Author appears a Man of as great Fi|gures, as in the fir&s;t of Eloquence, and tho&s;e Gentlemen and Town&s;men that have not been per&s;waded into a good Opini|on of Inoculation by 12 Lines of unanimated Oratory, are to be over-powered by a Demon&s;tration of Numbers. Let us then &s;uppo&s;e that there are 10,000 Per&s;ons in <HI>Bury,</HI> and but 3 of the&s;e have any Confidence in the Practice, there will remain 9997 clearly un&s;atisfied in Inoculation upon this Suppo&s;ition. But &s;ince this Article is wrote to per&s;wade the Wi&s;e, and deceive the Simple, and is the Ba&s;is of all the re&s;t, I may be thought un&s;ea&s;onably Drolling, where I &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly Arguing.</P>
<P>THE &s;trength and force of this Rea&s;on depends on the Truth of the Accounts, and what I have to &s;ay to their Au|thenticne&s;s will be this; the Computations from the Tables are <HI>arithmetically</HI> True and Ju&s;t, but as many Facts have been partially epre&s;ented, many material Circum&s;tances, which made again&s;t the Practice, were then &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; as the moving De|clarations of the dying Patients, and as &s;ome Mi&s;carriages by Inoculation were never tran&s;mitted to the Calculator, all which I think can be made evident beyond Contradiction, in &s;uch Ca&s;e the Accounts are &s;o far from de&s;erving an <HI>authentick</HI> Character, that they are mere Impo&s;itions. I &s;ay not this to a&s;per&s;e the Author of tho&s;e Accounts, for if I under&s;tand who is meant, I honour his Learning and Judgment, and have a great Opinion of his Integrity, and believe he u&s;ed an hone&s;t Diligence to &s;tate the Account right, but his Corre&s;pondents a di&s;ingenu|ous Indu&s;try to deceive him. And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that worthy Gentleman promi&s;ed that he would acquaint the Pub|lic with the Progre&s;s of this Practice from Year to Year, till it &s;hould be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed or ju&s;tly exploded. But whether from a Di&s;covery of the Suppre&s;&s;ions on one &s;ide, or the Mi&s;re|pre&s;entations on the other, he &s;ound it impracticable to do it with impartiality; or from a general Di&s;credit the Method of Inoculation &s;oon fell into, he found it u&s;ele&s;s, I am not wil|ling
<PB N="8" REF="6">to determine, but know of none he has publi&s;h'd for many Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT for once I will &s;uppo&s;e the Account authentic, and admit that every Fact was truly, exactly, and faithfully repre&s;ented, and every individual Mi&s;carriage was tran&s;mitted to the Cal|culator at the juncture of Time when the Supputation was made; Yet &s;urely our Author's Indu&s;try in getting fre&s;h Intelli|gence, or his Integrity in concealing what he received, or the little Acquaintance he has with Men of our Profe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be called in Que&s;tion; becau&s;e he takes no Notice of &s;everal un|happy Families, &s;ome of who&s;e Branches died mi&s;erable Sacri|fices to this inhumane Practice, long &s;ince the Date of his au|thentic Tables. To deny &s;uch Facts, &s;o well atte&s;ted is <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt,</HI> and to call them <HI>Forgeries</HI> is taking an unwarrantable Liberty with the Character of Witne&s;&s;es, for which rea&s;on I &s;hall for|bear laying before him &s;ome authentic Original Papers on this Subject, tran&s;mitted to me by Per&s;ons of good Fa&s;hion, and of undoubted and unque&s;tionable Credit, till &s;uch time as the Au|thor &s;hall creep out of his Ambu&s;cade, and &s;hall freely and openly declare upon what I&s;&s;ue he will put this Di&s;pute. I can ea&s;ily believe Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> gave our Author &s;uch a cautious An|&s;wer to his Query, and encouraged the Practice by Inoculating his own Child, and am as fully per&s;waded the Doctor was &s;o Ingenuous as to tell him, how Tragically the Practice ended in another Family about that Time, where 2 out of 2, died by Inoculation, which were under his Care.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed; As I am willing to make our Author all po&s;&s;ible Conce&s;&s;ions, I will grant him that not only his Ac|counts are truly Authentic, but that they have been carried down to the pre&s;ent Time, even to Ye&s;terday, and that the Cal|culation &s;tands that only 1 in 50 have died by Inoculation. Happy tho&s;e who have by &s;uch a lucky Chance, met at once their Death and end of all their Mi&s;eries&punc; For are there not
<PB N="9" REF="7">many lamentable Spectacles ju&s;t alive who have been Inocula|ted, many dreadful Images of Death, Monuments of Terror to any that are capable of Fear? If this be the Ca&s;e, I cannot but compa&s;&s;ionate the Condition of even tho&s;e that have &s;urvived the Operation, and <HI>what the Inoculators call,</HI> Recovered. But I &s;hall con&s;ider this Point more hereafter, and now go on to the Accounts of the Fatality of the natural Infection. And here tho' I could lay down &s;everal Calculations made in different Parts, widely differing from our Author's <HI>la&s;t Accounts,</HI> yet as I am &s;en&s;ible how ready &s;ome Per&s;ons are to embrace all Oppor|tunity of Cavil and Objection, and perhaps would in&s;inuate that &s;uch di&s;tant Supputation cannot be rely'd on; To put the Matter out of Que&s;tion, I have been at the Expence and Trouble to make a <HI>Local</HI> one, whereby it appeared that <HI>Jan.</HI> 28, 1683 Per&s;ons had had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> out of which Number 124 died, but as it evidently appears to me that many may, and ought to be deducted out of this Account of the deceas'd, I &s;hall &s;ubmit the following Particulars to our Author's and the Reader's Peru&s;al and Con&s;ideration.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Probably died for want of proper Phy&s;ic, Attendance, Su&s;tenance, and even Cloath|ing, notwith&s;tanding the extraordinary <HI>Charity</HI> of &s;ome Gentlemen, and the great Care of the Magi&s;trates, and Officers. 35</ITEM>
<ITEM>Abortives &s;uppo&s;ed to have died of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> becau&s;e the Mother had it. 6</ITEM>
<ITEM>Suppo&s;ed to have died of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> without having any Eruption. 3</ITEM>
<ITEM>Men and Women died of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> between 60 and 70. 5</ITEM>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<ITEM>Dy'd of the natural Sort, &s;uch as the Inoculators would not have practi&s;ed upon, as appears by their Cautions, which &s;ee hereafter <HI>in Page</HI> 12. 30</ITEM>
<ITEM>In all 79</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IF this Reduction be allowed me, then the Proportion will be con&s;iderably altered, and that it may, and ought, is evident to any that will con&s;ider how few have died in Families where there was tolerable Care taken, and proper Medicines and Methods of Cure followed. I could indeed further convince our Author of Mi&s;-calculation, when he &s;ays 1 in 6 died, but it mu&s;t be in a Way mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to my&s;elf, for I &s;hould &s;ubject my&s;elf to the Imputation of O&s;tentation, when I tell him that out of the great Numbers which I have attended <HI>ab Origine,</HI> not 1 in 70 have died under my Care; but to make him amends for &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed Vanity, I will inform him, that, under Provi|dence, the Succe&s;s lay in a previous Care, and &s;uch Rules of Ma|nagement I gave to the Per&s;ons, which in a general Infection I &s;uppo&s;ed probably might &s;oon receive it.</P>
<P>BUT to return; and make our Author farther Allowances, and totally reject this Reduction, yet after all 'twill not appear the Calculation &s;tands good: but &s;hall leave and reque&s;t him to con&s;ider the Proportion between 124 and 1683. To this I am really at a lo&s;s to conceive what he will &s;ay, unle&s;s it be what he Per|&s;onally in&s;inuated to me, that many Errors and Mi&s;takes were made by the Per&s;ons who took the Supputation, which put me to a &s;econd Trouble, to make a Review and Re-examination of the Matter, which was compared with the Church Books or Clerk's Accounts, and upon the Whole I &s;ound the Diffe|rences very immaterial; But to give our Author all po&s;&s;ible Sa|tisfaction, I will indulge him what Numbers he thinks rea&s;on|able
<PB N="11" REF="9">for Mi&s;takes, tho' I am not acquainted with one. Yet I cannot but ob&s;erve that a very material Impo&s;ition was offered me from the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> where this mighty Project was laid and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aily carried on, by a fal&s;e Repre&s;entation that Four had had it and Two died, whereas only One had it who recovered; What Motives could induce a Man of no great Sagacity or reach of Thought to give this Account, I &s;hall not determine.</P>
<P>'TIS now high Time to di&s;mi&s;s this Article, I &s;hall there|fore only add, that &s;uppo&s;ing the Accounts with regard to the inoculated and natural Sort to be Authentic and <HI>True,</HI> yet our new Introducer of this Method lies under, in my Opinion, two in&s;uperable Difficulties.</P>
<P N="1">1. THO' I grant him the Numbers given, yet be has not proved that this artificial Eruption is a pre&s;ervative again&s;t a natural One, &s;o that &s;ome who have &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to be practi&s;ed upon by the&s;e <HI>Schemati&s;ts</HI> may fall a Sacrifice to the providential Infection.</P>
<P N="2">2. I WILL fairly &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome Per&s;ons will never have the Small Pox. Now if the Inoculators &s;hould practi&s;e upon &s;uch a one, (and for ought they know they may) and the Patient die, and 'tis Pre&s;umption to &s;ay he &s;hall not. What Name &s;hall I give the Fact? What can be &s;aid to alleviate the Sorrows of the &s;urviving Relations? That the Inoculators are Principals of, and the Friends Acce&s;&s;ories to a <HI>horrid, wicked Act,</HI> is poor Con|&s;olation.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ART. II.P. 4.</HI></BIBL> It is to be ob&s;erved that the inoculated Small Pox has been found to be as favourable to grown People as to Children.</Q>
<P>MONSTROUS is this Ob&s;ervation! How many of the Inocu|lators &s;hall I produce as Evidences to the Contrary? To &s;tumble
<PB N="12" REF="10">at fir&s;t &s;etting out is certainly an ill Omen, and let him be careful that he makes no more fal&s;e &s;teps, lea&s;t he Tumble down.</P>
<P>Is it not well known that the Operators were &s;o Diffident of Succe&s;s, that they cho&s;e Children as Objects of their Cruel|ty, and whenever they ventured upon grown Per&s;ons, were they not curious in their Choice?</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;ecret Caution among&s;t 'em not to admit <HI>Women with Child.</HI> 2. <HI>Such to who&s;e Families the Small Pox u&s;ed to be fatal.</HI> 3. <HI>Such as are extremcly Fearful, Fanciful,</HI> Hy|&s;teric or Hypocondriac. 4. <HI>Such as are of choleric Con&s;titutions, are apt to Fevers, inflammatory Affections, Pleari&s;y, Ery&s;ipelas,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and &s;uch as have lately &s;urfeited and over-heated them&s;elves with</HI> Bacchus, <HI>or</HI> Venus, <HI>or great Labour.</HI> 5. <HI>Such as u&s;e to &s;pit Blood or have over-much Catamenia.</HI> 6. <HI>Such as have a Phthi&s;ic, Con&s;umption, Hectic-Fever,</HI> &amp;c. 7. <HI>Such as have the King's Evil, Gout:</HI> Or in Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s Words; <HI>To Inoculate none but Per&s;ons of good Habit of Body, and free not only from any Apparent, but as far as may be judged from any</HI> LATENT <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>How many then of both Sexes by the&s;e Exemptions are di&s;charged from the Danger, or not entitled to the Benefit of Inoculation, is an Inference obvious to every Reader; I would therefore (in Mr. <HI>Howgrave</HI>'s Words) ask the&s;e learned Mimicks of a few Ignorant <HI>Greek</HI> Women two Que&s;tions. 1. Whether Inoculation is not the mo&s;t Gentle and &s;afe Manner of hav|ing the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> and 2dly, Whether a Per&s;on of a weak Con&s;titution, or bad Habit of Body, be not as liable (if not more) to receive the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by In&s;ection, as the mo&s;t Healthful can be? The former Que&s;tion they will an&s;wer in the Affirmative, and the Latter I am con&s;ident they cannot deny. If this be the Ca&s;e, and Ino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lation be gentler and &s;afer, weak
<PB N="13" REF="11">and di&s;ordered Per&s;ons ought of all others to be incoulated, as le&s;s able to bear the more hazardous Effects of the natural Sort.</P>
<P>THE next Ob&s;ervation, P. 5. &s;hews the Author has not re|covered his fir&s;t Trip, but is &s;till &s;taggering on; for &s;ays he, it is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, <HI>all tho&s;e who have not had the</HI> Small Pox, <HI>and re&s;olve to continue in the Town, mu&s;t almo&s;t certain|ly</HI> have it now. I would willingly under&s;tand what is meant by that accurate Expre&s;&s;ion, All-<HI>mu&s;t Almo&s;t certainly. Almo&s;t</HI> joined with <HI>mu&s;t have it now,</HI> breaks the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome having it at all, if connected with <HI>certainly,</HI> weakens the Certi|tude of it. But I &s;tand not upon this Critici&s;m, &s;ince as a <HI>Gram|marian</HI> he may be right, yet that he is wrong in the Suppu|tation will appear by the Account here given.</P>
<P>THE 3d Article, P. 5. is introduced with an a&s;toni&s;hing Vio|lence to all the Rules of Rea&s;on, and all the re&s;traints of Truth, and clo&s;es with a &s;ingle In&s;tance of an uncommon Slaughter that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> made at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> For &s;ays he, <HI>A favour|able Sort, produces a favourable Sort, a Malignant, a malig|nant One;</HI> and then the Author with a magi&s;terial Air, lays down a notorious fal&s;e A&s;&s;ertion. <HI>This is certain in Inocula|tion.</HI> Surprizing Confidence! 'Tis true indeed, the fir&s;t Inocu|lators did boa&s;t as much, yet the many In&s;tances of the malig|nant Sort from a di&s;tinct Sort, obliged them mode&s;tly to yield what they could not maintain.</P>
<P>I HAVE always thought that a malignant or a favourable Sort proceeded from the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Blood and Tempera|ment of the Per&s;on receiving the Contagion; if this wants Proof, the different Sorts which have been produced in many Families of this Town, &s;hut up and excluded from the Com|merce or Sight of any of the infected, is a Demon&s;tration: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aver it upon my own Experience, I have ob&s;erved, tho' &s;ome|times
<PB N="14" REF="12">the fir&s;t of a Family that fell down of the Di&s;temper, had I will &s;ay, a malignant, confiuent Sort, the next the 2d, and 3d, who in all humane Probability received the poi&s;onous In|fection from this Per&s;on, had the Favourable and Di&s;tinct; and in the &s;ame Family, the 4th or 5th Patient &s;hould have the Malignant, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> and therefore one Part of this A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>[viz.] very highly probable</HI> is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>LET us examine the other, which with great Boldne&s;s is pronounced <HI>certain in Inoculation.</HI> Now I would ask this Author whether he thus roundly a&s;&s;erts this upon his own ex|perience in the Method of Inoculation; if he avers this, I am not &s;uch an ob&s;tinate Enemy to this dangerous Method as to deny Fact: But if he has not his own Experience to &s;upport it, I may be allowed to tell him that the printed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> The Ca&s;e of Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t</HI>'s Servant, Mrs. <HI>Waller,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hugh</HI>'s Daughter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Relations of the unex&s;pected Stubborne&s;s and Danger of this Di&s;temper under the Inoculators Hands, are Convictions that the Author tramples upon the Rules of Mode&s;ty to &s;upport an ill Cau&s;e. If the famous Operators in this Method have not always had the Charm to rai&s;e a kind Sort from a mild one, but have frequently <HI>con|jur'd</HI> up a malignant Sort which nothing but Death could <HI>bind.</HI> I would gladly know if this Gentleman has been taught this unfound Certainty in Inoculation by <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> and has hone&s;tly conveyed all the Secret to his Operators altogether unskilled and unacquainted in this Practice; If &s;o; I am not &s;o hardy as to di&s;pute (tho' we live in an Age not very &s;ond of) <HI>In&s;piration.</HI> But I expect proper Credentials, and till he pro|duces 'em, &s;hall call in Que&s;tion his Veracity in the next Lines, as much as I disbelieve the Certainty of his A&s;&s;ertion now. For here the Experience of old Nur&s;es will con&s;ute his Rea&s;oning, and inform him that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> at its fir&s;t <HI>coming into a Town is not always favourable, and as it &s;preads grows
<PB N="15" REF="13">more Malignant;</HI> and indeed at this very Time, <HI>viz. Febr.</HI> 20. 'tis notoriou&s;ly otherwi&s;e. For they have Sen&s;e enough to know, tho' few at its fir&s;t Inva&s;ion die of the Di&s;temper, and a great many die when it has continued long, this is owing not to an encrea&s;e of a malignant Sort, but to the Number of People taking the Infection at one time greater than the other. And thus every old Woman by her Remarks and Methods of telling by her Fingers, is ready to &s;ay the Author's Arithmetick which comes next, amounts to o. o. o.</P>
<P>I MUST follow him then thro' the By-Roads he takes to <HI>Uxbridge</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> where I &s;top to lament the Lo&s;s of &s;o many People who died of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in a natural Way; and tell him that to draw an univer&s;al Inference from a particu|lar In&s;tance, is very illogical, and un&s;cholarlike.</P>
<P>ART. IV. P. 6. The la&s;t Rea&s;on, <HI>viz. the general Good of Mankind,</HI> mu&s;t if well &s;upported, bring Inoculation into Repute and Practice, and be with great Readine&s;s embraced by tho&s;e who have not dive&s;ted them&s;elves of all Humanity and Bene|volence. But our Author leaves the mo&s;t Prevailing of his Rea&s;ons, if true, to &s;tand by, and &s;hift for its &s;elf, for he gives it no enforcement; unle&s;s Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s Calculation is a Support to it, but having already under the &s;econd Rea&s;on &s;hewn the In-equality of that Supputation with our Own, I &s;hall add no more; but wi&s;h our Author had.</P>
<P>YET I would under this Article &s;ay, that if Inoculation was thought &s;o great a Pre&s;ervative to Mankind, We of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion might in 10 or 12 Years, have &s;tudy'd the &s;afe practical Part of it, and brought it to a greater Perfection then at pre&s;ent is appears in, and kept it up in greater Honour then it now maintains among&s;t Us. But &s;ince there is &s;uch Uncertainty and In&s;ecurity in, and &s;uch a general Aver&s;ion of the People to the Operation, I am ready to believe the Inhabitants of <HI>Bury</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="14">will choo&s;e to re&s;ign them&s;elves into the Hands of Providence, rather than to &s;ubmit to be practi&s;ed upon, in a dangerous, painful Manner by inexpert Operators.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Bark, Opium,</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> have met with Oppo&s;i|tion I own, but have made their Way thro' the Indignation and Contempt of their Enemies, becau&s;e upon experience they have been proved u&s;eful Parts of the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> the&s;e with|out que&s;tion in &s;ome Hands are very fa&s;e, and very effectual Medi|cines, but by Mi&s;-application have proved very dangerous and de&s;tructive Ones, and yet he mu&s;t be very Weak that Condemns the u&s;e of the&s;e and many other Medicaments, becau&s;e &s;ome <HI>Em|piricks</HI> thro' <HI>Intere&s;t, Di&s;hone&s;ty, Ignorance or Folly,</HI> have wit|tingly or de&s;ignedly given them improperly. But the Prac|tice of Inoculation is ju&s;tly condemned, becau&s;e it is found to be un&s;ucce&s;sful, in&s;ecure, and not to an&s;wer the Intention.</P>
<P>AND now I proceed to Objection the 1. P. 7.</P>
<P><HI>WE are not certain that Inoculation is a Security from having the Di&s;temper again.</HI> But before I examine our Au|thor's Solutions of this Objection to Inoculation, give me leave to &s;ay, if I condemn'd his Judgment in the Choice of his Rea|&s;ons in Defence of the Practice; I will for once venture to com|mend his Skill in picking out &s;uch Objections, which he ima|gined he could an&s;wer, and pa&s;&s;ing over many more becau&s;e he could not. For <HI>&s;ome Rea&s;ons</HI> I beg he would be plea&s;ed to accept of &s;ome more Objections, I will not be unmerciful, but at pre&s;ent lay before him only the&s;e. 1. Our Climate and our Blood not &s;o proper to an Operation invented and practi&s;ed in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> 2. No Criterion is found to know the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Blood, to receive mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly the purulent Mat|ter to be inoculated. 3. No Proportion of the contagious Matter is agreed on by the Inoculators to do the Work &s;afely. When the&s;e &s;hall be an&s;wer'd, I will ask him a Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> What
<PB N="17" REF="15">is the Con&s;equence in that Con&s;titution, where Inoculation pro|duces only an imperfect Sort, or <HI>(as they artifully expre&s;s it)</HI> has no Effect?</P>
<P>I WILL now con&s;ider his An&s;wer. <HI>Several Per&s;ons who have been Inoculated, have been made to conver&s;e with, to handle, nur&s;e, lie in the &s;ame Bed with others &s;ick of the natural</HI> Pox, <HI>and no one ever had it again, as far as they that have enquired can learn.</HI> To give Force to this An|&s;wer the Author &s;lily &s;uppo&s;es, the inoculating Method has produced a true genuine <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and as a Proof of it, &s;ays, all Patients by the Means of receiving the Infection he mentions, <HI>never had it again, as far as they that have enquired can learn.</HI> I will not now enter into a Di&s;pute, whether a true <HI>Small Pox</HI> is <HI>ever</HI> brought out by Inoculation, or lay before him well atte&s;ted Hi&s;tories of Per&s;ons <HI>Inoculated,</HI> and &s;ome Time after, falling down of a <HI>natural Small Pox,</HI> &s;ince in his &s;econd An&s;wer I find all the&s;e mu&s;t go for <HI>Forgeries.</HI> But will tell him a Performance of all the&s;e kind Offices, which &s;ome Parents from an innate Affection to their Children have undertaken, others from a Notion of catching a kind Sort have Indu&s;triou&s;ly ventured on, &s;ome from a Nece&s;&s;ity of their Condition at|tending the Sick in tho&s;e Offices of Humanity, and e&s;caping the Infection then, have Years after received the contagious Di&s;temper. There are &s;ome in this Town who 21 Years pa&s;t, when it was vi&s;ited with this Di&s;temper &s;tood clear of this Di&s;|ca&s;e, under &s;uch Tryals, but have now had it. So that upon parity of Rea&s;on this Part of his An&s;wer is not &s;ound, for tho' the inoculated Patients have for &s;ome time &s;tood the Te&s;t, yet they may hereafter fall, and for ought they know very &s;oon into the natural <HI>Small Pox.</HI> And I am not without a Rationale of this Ob&s;ervation, which will further evidence the Weakne&s;s of our Author's An&s;wer, and confirm the Strength of mine. There is generally agreed to be an occult Di&s;po&s;ition or Semi|nium in the Blood to receive the <HI>Labes</HI> of this Di&s;ea&s;e, which
<PB N="18" REF="16">may be &s;o entangled in its <HI>Sinus,</HI> and may be under &s;uch a &s;ingular Combination of Texture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as to re&s;i&s;t the contagious Effluvia at one time, and at another may be fu&s;ceptible of them. 2d An&s;wer. <HI>Several Stories that have been invented to per|&s;wade the World of the Contrary, have been detected, and &s;hewn to be Forgeries.</HI> If my Reader is as hard of Belief, as our Author, in Hi&s;tories well &s;upported, which both of them may meet with in tho&s;e Tracts wrote 1722, 1723, and in many more &s;ince, I mu&s;t leave them entrenched in their Infidelity and con&s;ider his 3d An|&s;wer. <HI>As the inoculated</HI> Small Pox <HI>is in</HI> EVERY MINUTE <HI>Cir|cum&s;tance</HI> EXACTLY <HI>like the natural One.</HI> It would be very extraordinary &mdash; <HI>if it &s;hould not be like in this.</HI> This is an A&s;&s;ertion &s;o &s;hocking, becau&s;e egregiou&s;ly fal&s;e, that I have not Temper and Patience to &s;peak to it, but will venture to leave his own Practice, if he will allow proper Judges, as he ought to confute it, and am Confident 'tis not only Anomalous in <HI>&s;ome,</HI> but almo&s;t in <HI>every</HI> Circum&s;tance. Under this Head he adds. <HI>Whatever be the Rea&s;on why the Natural</HI> Small Pox <HI>pre|&s;erves us from Infection, it is inconceiveable that the Inocu|lated &s;hould not do the &s;ame, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on.</HI> I will kindly offer him two or three Conjectures, which I lay no great Weight upon. 1. That we take this Di&s;temper in a natural Way is mo&s;t generally agreed, from infected Particles in the Air, and conveyed to the Lungs by In&s;piration; and then po&s;&s;ibly the Ve&s;iculae of the Lungs may undergo &s;uch a Mutation and Alteration in their Contexture, as ever after to be un&s;u&s;cep|tible of the variolous Infection; but a Transfu&s;ion of this Ve|nom into the Arms and Legs, will not by its Fermentation be any Pre&s;ervative at all. 2. If there be a nece&s;&s;ary Concurrence and A&s;&s;ociation of the Texture, Shape, Order, and Magnitude of the Blood required to receive the Infection, this may in the Cour&s;e of Nature meet once and never again; But this Conjunction of Circum&s;tances being entirely unknown to us Mortals, mu&s;t leave the Inoculators in the Dark, and their Art in&s;ecute. 3. The Alteration made in the Skin by the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> that is, the Di&s;|tention
<PB N="19" REF="17">of the miliary Glands and Pores, Dr. <HI>Drake</HI> con|ceives to be the true Rea&s;on why that Di&s;temper never comes a &s;econd Time; And Dr. <HI>Pitcairne</HI> has ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e that have taken much <HI>Mercury</HI> which dilates tho&s;e Pores, are not &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of a Fever, for tho' the &s;ame feveri&s;h Di&s;po|&s;ition &s;hould, and may ari&s;e in the In&s;tances of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> or after much <HI>Mercury</HI> taken, yet the Pa&s;&s;ages thro' the Skin being more free and open, the Matter will never be &s;o &s;top'd as to rai&s;e the u&s;ual Symptoms in either Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT that this cannot be the Ca&s;e after Inoculation, is certain both in Rea&s;on and Fact, for the very Practicers of it have been obliged to confe&s;s and acknowledge that their Method has &s;ometimes only produced an <HI>ingenuine or imperfect</HI> Small Pox, and have expre&s;s'dly granted (becau&s;e &s;everal In&s;tances have prov'd) that &s;uch <HI>artificial</HI> Ingraftment was not preventive of of a &s;econd natural Crop; and 'tis farther evident as Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Seeds of the Di&s;ea&s;e are not al|ways carried off with tho&s;e Impurities, which are di&s;charged by Inoculation: but that tho&s;e fal&s;e Eruptions may be wholly un|mixt and unconcern'd with the Principles of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> &s;ince they alike follow upon Inoculation, whether the Per&s;on has ever had, or had not that Di&s;temper before. I &s;hould now proceed to the 2d Objection, yet cannot but fir&s;t ob&s;erve our Author's artful In&s;inuation, that it has been the <HI>Opinion of &s;ome</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e he means old Women) <HI>that the natural</HI> Small Pox <HI>was not an ab&s;olute Security again&s;t it a &s;econd Time,</HI> and then thank him that he owns this &s;o <HI>rarely happens as not to de&s;erve Notice.</HI> A very pretty, mode&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion! but let me tell him that I hereby call upon him to produce an In&s;tance or two of this, under &s;ome <HI>regular Phy&s;ician</HI>'s <HI>Hand</HI> within <HI>the&s;e</HI> twelve Years, the Time Inoculation has been practis'd among&s;t us, and in return by way of Compliment, promi&s;e him for every &s;uch &s;ingle Ca&s;e well atte&s;ted, to give him &s;eve|ral, where the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> has came on, after the Inocu|lators
<PB N="20" REF="18">had roundly a&s;&s;erted all po&s;&s;ible Security again&s;t it, and when I have made good this Engagement and produced &s;ome plain Hi&s;tories, I &s;hall humbly beg our Author to inform me how &s;tands the <HI>Proportion.</HI></P>
<P>I NOW proceed to the 2d Objection, which is, <HI>That the ino|culated</HI> Small Pox <HI>often leaves bad Con&s;equences, as Con&s;ump|tions, Boils, and Blotches, weak Eyes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHOEVER is acquainted with the Rules of Controver&s;y (a State of Life, few that have regard to them&s;elves would be brought into, but many that have a concern for others may) will own how unfair that Di&s;putant is, who does not put the Objections again&s;t him in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, let the Event of the Di&s;pute be what it will. Had this Objection, now to be con&s;idered, been fairly propo&s;ed, I am willing to believe, we might have recol|lected the <HI>Fable</HI> of the Viper and the File, but rather than not an&s;wer all Difficulties, becau&s;e &s;ome are in&s;olvable, many are to be &s;tifled. In this manner our Inocularian cowardly &s;uppre&s;&s;es a Catalogue of Maladies which are the Con&s;equences of Inocula|tion, but not of the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and undauntedly men|tions tho&s;e which are the Con&s;equences of both. However, I &s;hall beg leave to enforce this Objection, by giving an Explana|tion, and Interpretation of the Authors <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and adding to what he has mentioned, CONTRACTED LIMBS, HEMEPLEGIES, PERPETUAL CEPHELALGIES, PHRENSIES, FATAL MORTIFICATIONS.</P>
<P>HAS the Power of Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of this Method barr'd up all the Avenues to our Author's Mind, that Truth &s;hall be hindred admittance? Or are the Mi&s;takes of this An|&s;wer owing to an excu&s;able Ignorance, or unpardonable Inad|vertency? For to &s;ay that the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> is apt to leave <HI>the &s;ame &s;ort</HI> of ill Con&s;equences is a mi&s;take I am po&s;itive, but under <HI>which &s;ort</HI> to place the Ri&s;e of it. I am really at a Lo&s;s, I had rather our Author &s;hould chu&s;e. But if he will &s;till in|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="19">on <HI>the &s;ame &s;ort of ill Con&s;equences,</HI> which he acknow|ledges <HI>there</HI> are Methods which will <HI>for the mo&s;t Part entire|ly prevent or remedy, and always do it in &s;ome Degree.</HI> I mu&s;t expect of him to point me out &s;ome Ca&s;es from the na|tural Sort, &s;o formidable and &s;o &s;tubborn, that the Care and Skill of the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians and Chirurgeons, have been &s;o far baffled and prov'd ineffectual, that they have not <HI>in any Degree</HI> been meliorated by Art; for with many of the&s;e I take upon me to charge Inoculation, and <HI>at a proper Time</HI> will produce my Vouchers, and if &s;o, the <HI>Force of the Objec|tion</HI> is beyond his reach of Refuting. I will grant indeed our Author that the Di&s;orders attending the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> principally (but not altogether) depend on a Re&s;orbition of the putrid Matter into the Ve&s;&s;els upon the Declen&s;ion of the Di&s;|ea&s;e; but in the unnatural Kind, the Ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e, for in this, all the di&s;mal Train of Maladies, derive their &s;ource and origine from Nature's Inability, to throw out the venemous, malignant Matter, or in a proper Degree to depu|rate the Blood from the Poi&s;on which has been implanted; and I am firmly of Opinion, that Mr. <HI>Howgrave</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t, that the&s;e Di&s;orders are the Effects of the <HI>very Operators</HI> Preparations, which are by <HI>Purging and Bleeding;</HI> for what is propo&s;ed by <HI>Purging,</HI> if the Patient to be inoculated <HI>be not only free</HI> from any APPARENT but even any LATENT Di&s;ea&s;e; and if the&s;e are the only Per&s;ons to be inoculated, which has been &s;hewn, Where is the nece&s;&s;ity of Phy&s;ic or Phy&s;ician? We know not when, or where the Patient is afflicted but by Symptoms, and if none of the&s;e offer them&s;elves, we mu&s;t con|clude the Body is in a good State, and if any Per&s;on be of &s;uch a Habit of Body as to require the&s;e Preparations, then by their own Account, he is not a fit Subject for Inoculation. And as to <HI>Bleeding</HI> 'tis not only not nece&s;&s;ary, but MUST ALLMOST CERTAINLY be prejudicial, e&s;pecially when the very cold Re|gimen is rigorou&s;ly enjoyn'd, becau&s;e by the&s;e the Cra&s;is of the Blood may be &s;o weakned, as to render it incapable of
<PB N="22" REF="20">throwing off the corro&s;ive Matter, which Inoculation has for|ced into it. 'Tis true indeed, in the natural Sort the&s;e and o|ther preparative Methods, may, and frequently ought to be advi&s;ed, for in this Ca&s;e there will be no Danger, but that Na|ture of her&s;elf, or when properly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, will effectually re|ject whatever is offen&s;ive to her. Notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid, I will upon &s;econd Thoughts grant our Author that <HI>Preparation</HI> before the Operation, <HI>Attendance of a Phy&s;ician, during the Di&s;temper,</HI> and <HI>Care afterwards,</HI> may be very pro|per&mdash; <HI>if the Patient can pay well for it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to be &s;erious and return to our Author who, as I before ob&s;erved, has a magi&s;terial Way of laying down Po&s;itions un|&s;upported, but mu&s;t here remark a Method more &s;oft but not le&s;s affronting to his Reader, when he would <HI>&s;moothly</HI> lead him into two Mi&s;takes thus: <HI>One would naturally think therefore that where the mo&s;t corrupted Matter of the wor&s;t Kind is returned into the Blood, there the Di&s;orders &s;ucceeding the</HI> Small Pox <HI>&s;hould be mo&s;t and wor&s;t.</HI> And again, P. 11. <HI>It is inconceivable how a Quantity of corrupted Matter falling into the Body, &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of the Di&s;orders &s;ucceed|ing the</HI> Small Pox, &mdash; and <HI>yet the inoculated</HI> Small Pox <HI>where there is le&s;s of the Matter, and of a more kindly Nature be attended with wor&s;e Con&s;equences.</HI> Here are two Things ta|ken for granted which I can by no means allow. 1. That a greater Quantity of the infectious Matter is received Naturally. And 2dly, That 'tis of a more malign Nature than what is re|ceived by Inoculation. Is there any Argument to make either of the&s;e good? Is there any Rea&s;oning to evince the Truth of 'em? No; 'tis enough, <HI>Ip&s;e Dixit,</HI> and we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his &s;uperiour Judgment, and implicitly &s;wallow down his <HI>Compo|&s;ition.</HI> But with his Leave let me con&s;ider the Nature of the Malignity of the Infection. Is our Author unacquainted with &s;ome Poi&s;ons which when communicated to the Blood imme|diately prove fatal, but when received into the Stomach and
<PB N="23" REF="21">&s;o dige&s;ted, are innocent and inoffen&s;ive? May not the Viru|lence of the contagious Effluvia of the &s;ick and infected Things be newly modify'd by the Air, and many of the venomous <HI>Spicula,</HI> broke and blunted in their Pa&s;&s;age? Whereas the Acri|mony of gro&s;s Matter from a Pu&s;tle is no ways &s;heath'd or ob|tunded by the Inocularian Conveyance. But when our Author <HI>per&s;onates</HI> a Phy&s;ician, I have never been &s;urpriz'd to find him talking very erroneou&s;ly concerning the Quality of Di&s;ea&s;es and Remedies, but as a <HI>Geometrican</HI> I really always expected to have him very exact in any Con&s;ideration of Quantities and Divi&s;ibility of Matter. Let our Author then meditate a little upon the Difference between GROSS MATTER and EFFLU|VIA, and if he be at a Lo&s;s after &s;uch Reflection, I wou'd refer him to Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> who will inform him that &s;everal Bo|dies are &s;ound to emit Effluvia for a great Number of Years, as Magnets, Electrical Bodies, Ambers, divers Odorous Bodies, the Tenuity of who&s;e emanant Corpu&s;cles are &s;o incredibly &s;mall that they perceptibly lo&s;e neither Bulk or Weight.&mdash;Or let him con&s;ult &s;ome <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who will inform him how a Tun of Sack is poi&s;on'd and made an Emetick by a &s;mall Quan|tity of <HI>Crocus Metallorum,</HI> or by the <HI>Antimonial Cup,</HI> with|out dimunition of its Quantity or Quality: And if the&s;e will not give him Satisfaction, I cou'd tell him of a worthy Fami|ly in the Neighbourhood which has for many Years been po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of an Indian Stone, which immerg'd in Water, will make a generous Cordial, and in le&s;s than a Minutes Time; and this without any apparent Abatement of Sub&s;tance or Quality. Now if this be the Ca&s;e, and the Difference between gro&s;s Mat|ter and Effluvia be &s;o wide, one &s;ingle Pu&s;tule may contain Particles &s;ufficient to in&s;ect 10000 Per&s;ons in the Natural Way.</P>
<P>I SHALL add no more, but conclude this Reply to our Au|thor with informing him, &s;ince he &s;eems to have &s;o little Ac|quaintance with Men of our Profe&s;&s;ion, that &s;o many Remark|able and Notorious Facts have &s;upported the Force of this Ob|jection,
<PB N="24" REF="22">that the mo&s;t Learned and Judicious Practicers of Phy&s;ick and Surgery, both <HI>at Home and Abroad,</HI> have totally di&s;credited and rejected this Operation.</P>
<P>Obj. 3. P. 13. <HI>By Inoculation we may communicate other Di&s;tempers.</HI> Whether I was in the right when I commended our Author's Skill in choo&s;ing Objections again&s;t Inoculation, becau&s;e he thought he cou'd an&s;wer them, I know not, but am certain this Objection is founded upon &s;olid Rea&s;on; &s;up|ported by Experience, and is &s;o formidable to the Practice, that if our Introducer of this <HI>Mankind-Self-&s;erving</HI> Project does not clearly an&s;wer it, I am fully per&s;waded he will be di&s;appointed of his fir&s;t View injudiciou&s;ly open'd to his Read|ers in his la&s;t Words, becau&s;e it leaves them with Impre&s;&s;ions unfavourable to the Writer. If other Di&s;tempers may be com|municated and the Small Pox may not, as <HI>&s;ome Inoculators hone&s;tly own,</HI> that &s;uch a Mi&s;carriage &s;ometimes ari&s;es; I que&s;tion whether our Inoculator &s;tands the <HI>Chance</HI> of <HI>being regarded</HI> by 1 <HI>in</HI> 50, <HI>perhaps</HI> 60, 80, 100, 1000, or even more of the Inhabitants of <HI>Bury</HI> for an Enterprize &s;o hazardous to their Lives.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore particularly examine how he an&s;wers in the way of <HI>his Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> this &s;tubborn Objection.</P>
<P>MOST <HI>chronical Di&s;tempers,</HI> &s;ays our exact NUMERIST, <HI>are chiefly owing to the irregular make of the Ve&s;&s;els thro' which the Blood and Juices pa&s;s.</HI> Had he &s;aid SOME FEW I had a|greed with him. But &s;ince &s;o many chronical Di&s;tempers de|rive their Sources from the Vi&s;cidity, Fermentation, Rare&s;ac|tion, or Conden&s;ation of the Juices and their con&s;tituent Parts, the Motion and Circulation of which are often &s;topped and im|peded, when they are not well comminuted by Concoction: &s;ince many more are entirely owing to too great an Increa&s;e of &s;harp and acrimonious Salts, which intermixing with the
<PB N="25" REF="23">Fluids, leave in them &s;uch a corro&s;ive Quality, as in&s;tead of filtrating thro' the Glands, break thro', or wear them up. Since then &s;o many chronical Di&s;tempers take their Origine from other Cau&s;es, I cannot accede to our Author's A&s;&s;ertion. Nay, he is &s;o diffident and di&s;tru&s;tful of the Truth of his own Sentiments, that &s;oon after he acknowledges <HI>there are &s;everal Di&s;tempers which may be communicated by Methods no ways con&s;i&s;tent with this Account.</HI> I &s;hall leave therefore the further Examination of this A&s;&s;ertion, which indeed has no Force here, and had better have been omitted, &s;ince if our Calculator is wrong in his Account as he mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly is, the Po&s;ition betrays at the &s;ame Time his want of Judgment, in the Nature and Cau&s;e of chronical Di&s;tempers, and the Me|thod of palliating or curing them. But this puts me in mind of an Ob&s;ervation of the great <HI>Baglivi,</HI> who if I remember right &s;omewhere &s;ays; <Q>"In my Judgment, Mathematicks, Rhe|torick, Arithmetic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are as &s;erviceable to an accurate Hi|&s;tory of Di&s;ea&s;es, as the Art of Painting is to a Mu&s;ician."</Q></P>
<P>BUT to follow our Author who goes on thus: <HI>Now if this was the Ca&s;e of all, it would be as ju&s;t to affirm, that Inocu|lation could communicate the Features of another Man's Face, as communicate other Di&s;tempers.</HI> I mu&s;t own this is to me an unintelligible Con&s;equence drawn from the Author's own Pre|mi&s;&s;es, but as they are innocent, harmle&s;s Words, and <HI>communi|cate</HI> no force to his An&s;wer, and do no hurt to the Objection, I &s;uffer them to &s;tand in their Place, or to CIRCULATE <HI>with the Milk thro' the Body of a Nur&s;e.</HI> But I call my&s;elf off from breaking &s;uch Bubbles, and plead in my Defence, 'tis none of my Fault, if &s;ome Authors Write &s;o Triflingly, that they are not to be &s;olidly refuted.</P>
<P>YET &s;ince I &s;aid this Objection was built upon &s;olid Rea&s;on, and &s;upported by Experience, I think my&s;elf obliged to prove
<PB N="26" REF="24">the Po&s;&s;ibility, Probability, and Certainty of communicating of other Di&s;tempers by Inoculation of the <HI>Small Pox.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT is generally allowed that the Stamina or Principles of &s;ome dangerous Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as Madne&s;s, Lepro&s;y, Kings-Evil, Con&s;umptions, <HI>Lues Venerea, &amp;c.</HI> are by an hereditary Right entailed upon &s;ome Families for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e Principles compounded and &s;ormed in the Con&s;titu|tions of &s;ome Per&s;ons, are of a &s;ize &s;o exiguous, as to be imper|ceptible even to the mo&s;t Eagle-ey'd Chirurgeon, and of a Na|ture &s;o quiet and dormant as not to enter upon Action, unle&s;s by &s;ome adventitious Cau&s;e rou&s;ed up.</P>
<P N="3">3. A VARIOLOUS FEVER by a violent and extraordinary Fermen|tation of the whole Ma&s;s of Blood, rou&s;es the&s;e Seeds, and they mix with tho&s;e of the <HI>Small Pox:</HI> and a Pu&s;tule taken from &s;uch a Per&s;on, who has the Seeds of any of the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, may as well convey the Principles of &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es, as of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> into another clear of them before.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN thus conveyed they have a Power in the minute&s;t Size to convert a large Ma&s;s of Liquids into their noxious Na|ture, and by this A&s;&s;imilation ruin the Cra&s;is of the Blood, and in progre&s;s of Time produce a homogeneous Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT I am not &s;ingular in allowing &s;uch <HI>Semina</HI> and Agen|cy of 'em to corrupt the Blood and Humours, and by Degrees bring them into &s;uch a &s;tate of A&s;&s;imilation as may cau&s;e a Di&s;temper of the &s;ame Family to break out, will be clear to tho&s;e who have read the mechanical Account of Poi&s;on, wrote by the judicious and learned Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> in which Treati&s;e he &s;everal Times, and various Ways confirms and e&s;tabli&s;hes this Notion, Particularly p. 84. <Q>"What is thrown out from Liquors in a Ferment is capable of inducing the like Motion in another
<PB N="27" REF="25">Liquor of the &s;ame Kind, when duly mixt with it".</Q> Again, <Q>"A Per&s;on thus affected <HI>(viz. by a mad Dog)</HI> may be &s;aid in a Degree to have put on the canine Nature, tho' his Rea&s;on be all this time untouch'd and entire, may Bite, Howl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e the like violent Agitation of the Blood in him as was in the Dog, will pre&s;ent like Species, and con&s;equently (&s;o far as their different Natures will allow) produce like Ac|tions, <HI>&amp;c</HI>".</Q></P>
<P>I WILL only add another Quotation, from an Author who is as great an Ornament of our Profe&s;&s;ion in the <HI>French</HI> Nation, as the La&s;t is in our <HI>own, [viz.] Helvetius,</HI> who expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Animal Oeconomy,</HI> P. 132. <Q>"When the Blood abounds with Humours of different Qualities, which are likewi&s;e di&s;&s;olved along with the variolous Humours, the Di&s;ea&s;e in that Ca&s;e cannot be Simple, but mu&s;t be compli|cated".</Q> From the&s;e Authorities it appears that the Depo|&s;ita of &s;ome bad Di&s;ea&s;e may incorporate with the purulent Matter of a Pu&s;tule, and the Pu&s;tule being a Compo&s;ition of variolous Poy&s;on and of the&s;e Seeds, may <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> and <HI>probably</HI> communicate a Chaos of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT Po&s;&s;ibilities and Probabilities are Bugbears and may fright Children, but not move a wi&s;e Man; For <HI>the infectious Matter</HI> (&s;ays our Author) <HI>according to Experience appears to communi|cate nothing but what it was intended to communicate, the Small Pox.</HI> Now this is another un&s;upported A&s;&s;ertion again&s;t Fact, and <HI>mu&s;t be tried</HI> by Experience, which &s;hews a CERTAINTY of &s;uch complicated Communication, and as a Proof &s;hall <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> only beg his Review of the printed Relations, and particular|ly Mi&s;s <HI>Rolt</HI>'s and Lord <HI>Percival</HI>'s Son's Ca&s;e, both of which in a lingering Di&s;ea&s;e mi&s;erably lived <HI>and at la&s;t</HI> died Victims to this barbarous Practice; but <HI>hereafter</HI> if our Author &s;hall think fit to undertake a general Hi&s;tory of the Succe&s;s of Ino|culation

<P>I GO on with our Author who generally at the beginning of an Article &s;eems to <HI>triumph be it only for a Flouri&s;h</HI> in a <HI>line or two</HI> but at the Clo&s;e &s;uppo&s;es <HI>all that has hitherto been advanced may be &s;et a&s;ide,</HI> and is by my Con&s;ent. But his for&s;orn Hope being cut off, we mu&s;t depend upon Porters, Ploughmen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>here we have a moral Certainty, that the&s;e have &s;ound and healthy Con&s;titutions.</HI> The&s;e indeed <HI>can|not</HI> be Leprous, Scabious, Scorbutick, Rheumatick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the&s;e <HI>cannot</HI> be &s;ubject to any LATENT Di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o that from the&s;e, all Gentlemen may be inoculated very &s;afely without any Com|munication of any other Di&s;temper, and the Ladies have no rea|&s;on to fear a Communication of Features, <HI>becau&s;e it would be as ju&s;t to affirm that Inoculation could communicate the Features of another Man's Face, as communicate other Di&s;tempers.</HI> But I will farther add, and oblige our Author with another nece&s;|&s;ary Caution in the Practice of Inoculation, which perhaps he never heard of before, and tell him that <HI>it is the Opinion of &s;ome,</HI> that even the vicious Inclination of a Nur&s;e may by the Milk be communicated to her &s;uckling Infant; if &s;o, methinks he &s;hould be very careful and inqui&s;itive into the moral Di&s;po|&s;ition of the Per&s;on from whom the Matter is taken, for o|therwi&s;e he may imprudently bring an Hone&s;t Man to the Gallows, and make a Mode&s;t Virgin a Brazen Pro&s;titute; but <HI>this perhaps will &s;o rarely happen, as not to de&s;erve Notice.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE now given a &s;hort An&s;wer to a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>Some Rea&s;ons,</HI> &amp;c. If my Friends have expected it &s;ooner, or wi&s;h'd for a Longer, I mu&s;t tell a plain and undi&s;gui&s;ed Truth, I had neither Inclination for the one, nor Time for the o|ther; and in tho&s;e Hours I &s;at down to write, I have been &s;o frequently interrupted, that it is more my Wonder that I
<PB N="29" REF="27">have fini&s;h'd &s;o &s;oon, than that the Impatience of my Ac|quaintance &s;hou'd make them think I delay'd too long. But I hope I have &s;aid enough to di&s;courage a Practice in&s;ecure of its Intention, often pernicious in its Con&s;e|quences, frequently fatal in its Event, to tho&s;e who volun|tarily and freely &s;ubmit to it; and &s;urely neither Per&s;wa|&s;ion or Compul&s;ion &s;hould be u&s;ed when Health and Life are the Stakes. It mu&s;t undoubtedly therefore lay all tho&s;e who are by fine PROMISES drawn into it, or by inhumane THREATS forc'd into it, under unrequitable Obligations to the Projector.</P>
<P>IF OTHERS can calmly &s;ee a dete&s;table Method di&s;cre|dited every where el&s;e, introduced among&s;t their Friends and Acquaintance; I mu&s;t own I could not be Pa&s;&s;ive and Silent and with coolne&s;s of Temper &s;ee it; I could not even for&s;ee their Mi&s;eries without Horrour, and thought my&s;elf obliged by the Ties of Humanity and Friend&s;hip, to do my utmo&s;t to prevent them. This was the &s;ole Motive of my Writing this An&s;wer, and if I am &s;o happy as to &s;top a mo&s;t dangerous Scheme, the Plea&s;ure of doing good is Reward great enough for me. And &s;ince our Author in his la&s;t Line without any Hypocri&s;y owns an ambitious View of being <HI>regarded,</HI> I with|out Envy wi&s;h he may meet with as much regard, as his Mo|de&s;ty joined with his Merit may ju&s;tly claim.</P>

<P>I Had determined not to Publi&s;h any Letters from my own private Corre&s;pondents, or Re-print any from the Tracts <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> but to fill up an empty Page, have &s;ubjoined the fol|lowing Moving one from Mrs. <HI>Rolt,</HI> a Lady of good Sen&s;e and Fa&s;hion.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>A Letter from Mrs.</HI> Rolt. <HI>Dated</HI> September, 16, 1724.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I determin'd by my Friend's Per&s;wa&s;ion to have my Daughter inoculated, I &s;ent for Mr. <HI>A&mdash;d,</HI> he as'k but few que&s;tions about her, but I told him &s;he had the <HI>Jaundice</HI> about a Year before, and &s;ome Months after a &s;mall relap&s;e into it, that from that time &s;he had been very well, till &s;he had the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> about two Months before, and getting &s;oon well of it, had been ever &s;ince with a Relation at <HI>Ep&s;ome.</HI> He declar'd him&s;elf very well &s;atisfied with her State of Health, and tho' I propos'd having a Phy&s;ician to attend her, ask'd him whe|ther there was not to be &s;ome Preparation, and particularly mention'd, cutting off her Hair; he &s;aid there was no occa&s;ion for any thing I had offered, that the Child would be &s;o well all the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, that &s;he would play about the Room the whole Time.</P>
<P>About five or &s;ix Days after the Inoculation, &s;he was &s;eiz|ed with great Pains in all her Joints. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> came out about the 10^t^h or 11^t^h Day very violently, and was what
<PB N="31" REF="29">they call the <HI>flux</HI> Sort; upon which I propos'd again a Phy|&s;ician, Mr. <HI>A&mdash;d</HI> upon it nam'd one he had a mind, which I con&s;ented to, &s;oon after another was call'd, who he &s;aid un|der&s;tood Inoculation: &s;oon after their Bleeding her, there ap|peared a &s;welling upon one of her Elbows, upon which I was very much flatter'd, that it was a mark &s;he would do well, as I was often in the cour&s;e of her Illne&s;s. In nine Weeks after the In|oculation, and after the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Suffering, that ever poor Creature underwent, &s;he died worn to nothing but Skin and Bone. She had <HI>&s;ix and thirty running Sores (none of them having ever been heal'd)</HI> when &s;he died; and they were forced to roll up her <HI>Joints in Pa&s;t-board,</HI> lea&s;t the Joints &s;hould fall out of their Places.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible of the Reports which have been &s;pread a|bout her, <HI>[viz.]</HI> that &s;he was eat up of the Kings-evil, that &s;he had had the Black-Jaundice, and that &s;he was not well cured of that, nor of the <HI>Mea&s;les.</HI> The Contrary of which, was af|firm'd to me by tho&s;e who had the Care of her in tho&s;e Illne&s;|&s;es, and as to the King's-evil it never happen'd, either to Mr. <HI>Rolt</HI>'s or my Family, nor was it ever &s;u&s;pected by the <HI>Phy&s;ici|ans</HI> who had treated her. And Mr. <HI>A&mdash;d</HI> him&s;elf as I &s;aid be|fore, allowed her to be in a very good Condition, and fit for the Operation even without the help, either of a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> or any Preparation.</P>
<P>After this it is very extraordinary to have &s;uch Reports &s;pread; and particularly that <HI>any Man</HI> &s;hould talk in Print <HI>of the irre|gular Life of a Child of nine Years old;</HI> for near two Years before the <HI>Mea&s;les,</HI> &s;he had been at Mr. <HI>Caverlas</HI> School, which is allow'd to be one of the be&s;t govern'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I could &s;ay much more upon this Subject, but as every par|ticular of this is <HI>Fact,</HI> the World may &s;ee by it the <HI>Humanity</HI> of having &s;uch a <HI>Misfortune</HI> aggravated, by the very <HI>People,</HI> who at lea&s;t &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome Repentance, for the Mi&s;ery they brought upon an afflicted Mother.</P>
