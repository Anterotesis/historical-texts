<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE NATURE AND SEAT OF THE <HI>DIABETES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SCARCE any di&s;order has afforded greater matter of &s;peculation, e&s;pecial|ly of late Years, than the <HI>Diabetes;</HI> yet the true <HI>Rationale</HI> of it is not &s;o accurately under&s;tood, as to render a farther enquiry into its nature and cau&s;es, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;earch out the rea&s;ons of the &s;everal Symptoms of it, u&s;ele&s;s or unnece&s;&s;a|ry. Among&s;t the Antients is was &s;eldom heard of. <HI>Aretaeus</HI> &s;peaks of it, as &s;omething mi|raculous, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Miraculum quoddam:</HI> And <HI>Galen</HI> confe&s;&s;es, that in the cour&s;e of his Practi&s;e he only &s;aw two Pa|tients
<PB N="2" REF="3">labouring under this complaint. The <HI>uncommone&s;s</HI> of it might be owing to a diffe|rent manner of Living, but the di&s;order was probably the &s;ame. For the de&s;cription, which they give of it, in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points agrees with that of the Moderns; it is true indeed, that mo&s;t of them &s;peak of liquor pa&s;&s;ing through the kidney not in the lea&s;t chang'd, and make no mention of the &s;weet|ne&s;s of the Urine: But the&s;e are mi&s;takes, which the colour of the Urine for want of accuracy, and ob&s;ervation, might be the cau&s;e of their falling into; for, as Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> ob|&s;erves, it always appears crude, and watry as of tho&s;e labouring with the <HI>Pica,</HI> or with the Drop&s;y. Their Methods al&s;o of cure, which were rationally founded, and in mo&s;t re&s;pects &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent practi&s;e, are a farther confirmation of this opinion. <HI>Galen</HI> made u&s;e of the following Medicines, as he him&s;elf te|&s;tifies, to the great relief of his Patient. <HI>Bol. Armen. Gum. Tragac. &mdash; Arab. &mdash; Ma&s;tich. Spodium. Sem. Endiv. &mdash; Portulac.</HI> &amp;c. and they &s;eem to be well adapted to the remo|val of this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o far as they are known to &s;trengthen weakn'd Solids, to &s;heath a|crimonious humours, to incra&s;&s;ate too much attenuated blood, to abate hectick fevers,
<PB N="3" REF="4">and to cool the body. But this will be far|ther con&s;ider'd in its proper place. It may not be improper, before we enter upon the enquiry, briefly to point out the opinions, which the Ancients and &s;ome of the Moderns entertain'd of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De curat. Diabet. Lib. 2. c. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Aretaeus</HI> &s;uppos'd it to be a &s;pecies of a Drop&s;y, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and that it was owing to an Univer&s;al debility of body. For as in a Drop&s;y the &s;olid parts of the body are di&s;|&s;olv'd into water, &s;o in a <HI>Diabetes</HI> they are melted down into
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. De morb. diut. Lib. 2. c. 2.</NOTE> Urine. But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a wa&s;te of the body, and &s;uch a di&s;&s;olution of the Solids, how comes it to pa&s;s, that they are di&s;&s;olv'd into Urine? May not the humours ari&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;uppos'd decay, and wa&s;ting of the body tend to any other Vi&s;cus, as well as to the kidney? And &s;ee|ing it is well known, that all fluids naturally tend to the weake&s;t parts, is it not by far more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that they &s;hould be lodg'd either in the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> or <HI>mem|brana cellulo&s;a,</HI> (being tho&s;e parts of the bo|dy,
<PB N="4" REF="5">which give the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance,) and form drop&s;ical &s;wellings, than be evacuated by U|rine? Such an Univer&s;al con&s;umption then of the body does not &s;eem to be the pri|mary cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, but may be, and is the con&s;equence of it.</P>

This account of it then &s;hews rather a fertility of imagina|tion,
<PB N="5" REF="6">than &s;olidity of rea&s;oning. For the po&s;|&s;ibility of &s;uch an attraction is &s;urely as dif|ficult to be conceiv'd, as the cau&s;e of attra|ction it&s;elf.

<P>A <HI>Diabetes,</HI> &s;ays
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Tom. prim. p. 376.</NOTE> <HI>Etmuller,</HI> is either genuine, or &s;purious. The former is a voiding of li|quors by Urine without undergoing any al|teration in the body: The latter is a voiding of a much larger quantity of Urine than of liquids receiv'd into the body: The cau&s;e of the former, he thinks, is owing to a laxity and openne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ages, which lead di|rectly from the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages to the kidnies. But the&s;e, he confe&s;&s;es, are not yet known, and no wonder; becau&s;e it is evident from
<PB N="6" REF="7">the nice&s;t ob&s;ervations made in Anatomy, that there are no &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages leading directly to the kidnies, as he imagines, and therefore that no liquor can po&s;&s;ibly arrive to the kid|nies, but by fir&s;t entring into the blood. To account for the latter, he &s;uppo&s;es, a &s;harp acrimony in the blood, which re&s;olves, atte|nuates, and melts down the blood, and even the mu&s;cular fle&s;h it&s;elf into &s;erum, which be|ing thus melted down, &s;timulate the kidnies, and force their pa&s;&s;age. But this account of it is &s;o very &s;trange and unphilo&s;ophical, that it will not admit of a &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exercit. de Diabete</HI> p. 65.</NOTE> <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> is &s;ingular in his opinion, and thinks that the chief &s;eat of this di&s;order is in the Stomach, and &s;mall Inte&s;tines: <HI>At primaria hujus morbi &s;edes e&s;t Stomachus, &amp; Inte&s;tina tenuia:</HI> But if the&s;e parts of the body were principally affected, a <HI>Lientery,</HI> or a <HI>Diarrhaea</HI> rather than a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> would &s;urely be pro|duc'd.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> that great Phy&s;ician of his time, ob&s;erves, that Rheni&s;h Wine, Cyder, and a|cid liquors being drank provoke a more plen|tiful <HI>Diure&s;is</HI> or evacuation by Urine: The cau&s;e of this evacuation he attributes to a fu&s;ion
<PB N="7" REF="8">or melting of the blood into &s;ero&s;ities by &s;uch acid liquors; &s;o that the Cra&s;is or mixtion of the blood being di&s;&s;olv'd, the watry parts cannot be contain'd by the more thick, but &s;liding from their embraces, and being im|bu'd with &s;aline particles, do run through the mo&s;t open pa&s;&s;ages of the Reins, and &s;o cau&s;e a <HI>Diabetes.</HI> And he gives us an In|&s;tance of one, who by u&s;ing Rheni&s;h Wine for his ordinary drink twenty days together, contracted an incurable <HI>Diabetes,</HI> of which he dy'd within a month. But the <HI>Diabetes</HI> in this ca&s;e, and when brought on by an im|moderate drinking of &s;uch thin acid liquors does not &s;eem to be owing to &s;uch a di&s;&s;olu|tion of the blood, as the Doctor intimates, but to the natural di&s;po&s;ition of &s;uch liquors to pa&s;s off by Urine. The Secerning Ve&s;&s;els of the kidney then mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be over|loaded by the great quantity of fluids, which they admit, and of cour&s;e greatly relax'd, and hence a <HI>Diabetes</HI> will en&s;ue, as will be &s;hewn more particularly in its due place. For let the blood be in ever &s;o di&s;&s;olute and bro|ken a &s;tate, this Di&s;temper will not be pro|duc'd, unle&s;s there is a relaxation of the kid|ney in conjunction with it, but rather a drop|&s;y, and for rea&s;ons that have been already
<PB N="8" REF="9">in&s;i&s;ted upon. An immoderate drinking then of acid liquors, and thin wines, by their quick and &s;uddain pa&s;&s;age through the kidneys will bring on a debility of the&s;e organical parts, widen their Secretory ducts, and in this man|ner produce a <HI>Diabetes;</HI> and &s;uch an exce&s;s of them &s;eems to be the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The account which
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Animal Secretion</HI> p. 70.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>James Keil</HI> gives of this di&s;ea&s;e comes next to be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;erts <Q>"that the mo&s;t evident cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e is an habitual drinking of &s;trong liquors; and that the more &s;pirituous they are, the &s;ooner and more violently they bring it. By &s;uch an habitual drinking of &s;trong liquors it comes to pa&s;s in proce&s;s of time, that the Serum, or thin part of the blood, contains a large proportion of a &s;pirituous Fluid, or that part of the Serum, which &s;hould be water, is for the greate&s;t part Spirit. Now the Salts of the Urine or blood will not di&s;&s;olve in a vinous &s;pirit, that is, the particules of which the &s;alts con&s;i&s;t, are more &s;trongly attracted by one another, than they are by &s;uch a fluid, as by experiment
<PB N="9" REF="10">appears; and therefore the Quantity of Salts in the blood will be daily increas'd, and cir|culating through the Capillary Ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t irritate the fine fibres, and cau&s;e little pains and twitchings all over the body, which, he &s;ays, are the preceding Symptoms of this di&s;order. But when the Serum is full of the&s;e &s;alts, the di&s;tance between them and the Globules of the blood will be le&s;s, and con&s;equently they will attract the Globules of the blood more &s;trongly than the Globules attract one another; And the Globules or red part of the blood will be di&s;&s;olv'd and diffus'd through the Serum of the blood. And this again is confirm'd by experiments, for nothing does render the red part of the blood &s;o fluid, and keeps it more from coa|gulating when drawn into a cup, than U|rinous Salts and Spirits. When the red part of the blood is thus di&s;&s;olv'd, and united to its Serum, it will with the Serum be carried off through the Glands of the kidneys, and being united to their Salts, will alter their Figures, and properties, as Litharge and Co|ral do the Salts of Vinegar, giving them a &s;weet ta&s;te."</Q></P>
<P>In this account of the <HI>Diabetes</HI> there &s;eems to be more ingenuity, than truth. That Spi|rituous
<PB N="10" REF="11">liquors when drank to exce&s;s may be productive of this di&s;order, will be &s;hewn in the &s;equel of this di&s;&s;ertation; but that an habitual drinking of them is the mo&s;t evident cau&s;e of it, is evidently not true. But grant|ing &s;uch a di&s;&s;olution of the red part of the blood, as the Dr. imagines, which may be po&s;|&s;ible, but does by no means &s;eem probable, there is no rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd, why it &s;hould with its Serum be carried off through the Glands of the kidney. The objections which have been already made, occur here.</P>
<P>Proceed we now to the opinion of the ce|lebrated
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the new Edit. of his book on poi&s;ons p. 32.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> which demands our at|tention as well for its &s;ingularity, as for the eminent Character of its Author. <Q>"The <HI>Dia|betes,</HI> he &s;ays, is not as Phy&s;icians have com|monly judg'd, a di&s;temper of the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> but of the <HI>Liver,</HI> proceeding likewi&s;e from a vitiated mixture of the bile. It mo&s;t fre|quently happens to tho&s;e, who without due exerci&s;e indulge them&s;elves in drinking vi|nous liquors, and then quench their thir&s;t ari&s;ing from the&s;e, by too great a quantity of &s;uch as are cooling.</Q></P>
<Q><P>By &s;uch ill-timed heating, and cooling of
<PB N="11" REF="12">the humours of the body, the natural pro|portion of Salt in the bile, by which its oily part is incorporated with the water, is not &s;ufficient, now the water over-a|bounds, to pre&s;erve the mixture: So that a great portion of this, together with &s;ome of the thinne&s;t of the oil will be di&s;charg'd by the kidneys; and the Urinary Ducts will be greatly enlarg'd by a con&s;tant aflux that way. By which means the thicker oily par|ticles are left in a degree of coagulation in the &s;maller tubes of the Liver, and are there form'd into a hard fatty &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;ection of tho&s;e, who have died of the <HI>Diabetes,</HI> proves this to be &s;o: For I have always found a <HI>&s;teatomatous</HI> collection in their Liver, in appearance not unlike to what is often di&s;charg'd by &s;tools in a con|firm'd jaundice, but of a harder con&s;i&s;tence."</P></Q>
<P>In the fir&s;t place let it be here ob&s;erv'd, that the texture of the
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">v. Boerhaave<HI>'s</HI> acad. Lect. V. 3. p. 110.</NOTE> kidney is &s;o very clo&s;e and compact, that in its natural &s;tate, before it has &s;uffer'd any kind of violence, it will not admit any oily &s;ub&s;tance whatever, unle&s;s it be highly attenuated, and thorough|ly incorporated in a proper vehicle. A Pre|ternatural
<PB N="12" REF="13">dilatation of the kidney mu&s;t be <HI>prior</HI> to its admittance of any fluid, that is more gro&s;s than the Urine. It does not then &s;eem probable, that even this thinne&s;t oil in &s;uch circum&s;tances, when the mixture is de|&s;troy'd, can be admitted to pa&s;s through the kidney. Be&s;ide, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of the li|ver, as is here &s;uppos'd, and &s;uch a vitiated mixture of the bile mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be attend|ed with a high <HI>jaundice,</HI> but as the <HI>Diabetes</HI> often appears without the lea&s;t icterical Sym|ptom, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily to follow, that the liver is not the Seat of the <HI>Diabetes.</HI></P>
<P>The ingenious Dr. <HI>Randolph</HI> in his treati&s;e upon the Medicinal Virtues of the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Wa|ter, after having made &s;ome ju&s;t ob&s;ervations upon the&s;e accounts of it la&s;t mention'd, gives us his opinion of it, and is inclin'd to think the kidnies the Seat of this di&s;order, tho' he owns, that the great alteration made in the Urine &s;eems very much to favour the opinion of a fault in the fluids; for if the kidnies, &s;ays he, were only in fault, why &s;hould Dia|betical Urine differ &s;o much from that which is natural, not only in <HI>Quantity,</HI> but in <HI>Qua|lity</HI> al&s;o? But the rea&s;on of this alteration will evidently appear by pro&s;ecuting the en|quiry farther, than &s;eems to have been con|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="13" REF="14">with his de&s;ign; and in order to pro|ceed more methodically;</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t de&s;cribe a <HI>Diabetes</HI> by pointing out the &s;everal Symptoms of it.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, &s;hew how a relaxation of the <HI>Secre|tory</HI> Ducts of the kidnies with a broken &s;tate of the blood, which may be <HI>prior</HI> to &s;uch a relaxation, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the cau&s;e of &s;uch Symptoms, and when not, will be the con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on then is known to labour under a <HI>Diabetes</HI> by the following Symptoms, to wit; a copious and frequent di&s;charge of pale-co|lour'd Urine; the ta&s;te of which is &s;weet; the Quantity evacuated exceeds in proportion the Quantity of liquors taken in; it is found to acquire a ropy con&s;i&s;tence by being expos'd for &s;ome time to the air; as a con&s;equence of this di&s;charge, a hectick fever, lo&s;s of fle&s;h, great thir&s;t, a &s;en&s;e of weakne&s;s about the Loyns; and if <HI>con&s;titutional,</HI> or too far ad|vanc'd by a neglect of proper remedies, the Per&s;on &s;o affected in reality dies of a con&s;um|ption. The&s;e are then the mo&s;t remarkable Symptoms of a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> and the known con|&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>I am in the next place to &s;hew how a re|laxation of the <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts of the kid|nies
<PB N="14" REF="15">with a di&s;&s;olute broken blood mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be productive of the&s;e Symptoms. But here it will be proper fir&s;t to point out the cau&s;es, by which &s;uch a relaxation may be brought on.</P>
<P>And here let it be remark'd, that whenever a Gland is in a &s;tate of relaxation it will not duly perform its re&s;pective office.</P>
<P>It is well known, that whatever &s;tretches out an animal fibre beyond its due degree of di&s;ten&s;ion, and keeps it for &s;ome time &s;o di|&s;tended, will weaken the contractive &s;pring of that fibre.</P>
<P>Now the Glands may be relax'd, or their contractive &s;pring weakn'd, by &s;everal diffe|rent means; as fir&s;t, by being pre&s;t upon with too great a quantity of fluids, and this may happen either from a &s;toppage of per&s;pira|tion, or from a defect of Secretion in one Gland, which may be occa&s;ion'd by &s;ome ob|&s;truction form'd in the <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts of that Gland, and is known to encrea&s;e the Secre|tion in another; becau&s;e &s;uch an ob&s;truction will in effect be the &s;ame as an actual increa&s;e of the fluids; a con&s;equence of which will be encreas'd Secretions. It may al&s;o happen from the Critical di&s;charges of acute fevers lodging their malignity on the&s;e parts; and from exce&s;&s;es of every kind falling on the&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="16">parts; and here it may be ob&s;erv'd, that &s;uch exce&s;&s;es will chiefly affect tho&s;e parts, which are by con&s;titution the weake&s;t, and the di&s;|order produc'd will corre&s;pond with the na|ture and office of that organical part, which is affected.</P>
<P>The Glands may al&s;o be relax'd, and the cra|&s;is of the blood broke by <HI>Mercurial Salivations,</HI> by a long continu'd u&s;e of powerful <HI>Deob&s;tru|ent</HI> Medicines, and the kidnies in particulr by an improper u&s;e of &s;uch as are &s;til'd <HI>Diu|retick.</HI></P>
<P>An habitual drinking of Spirituous liquors will al&s;o bring on the &s;ame ill effects, and may in &s;ome circum&s;tances be the cau&s;e of a <HI>Diabetes.</HI></P>
<P>But to explain the rea&s;on of this. &mdash;</P>
<P>It appears from &s;everal
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hale's Haemas. p. 124.</NOTE> experiments, that all &s;trong liquors not only contract the &s;mall ar|teries, but al&s;o coagulate the fluids, which are contain'd in them. A con&s;equence of the&s;e effects will be a &s;toppage of the <HI>Secretions,</HI> and if often produc'd, a relaxation of the fi|bres of the Stomach, and Inte&s;tines; hence will ari&s;e a failure of dige&s;tion, and of cour&s;e of nutrition. When the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary offices

<P>This in&s;tance then beautifully illu&s;trates, and &s;trongly confirms the Theory laid down.</P>
<P>But to proceed &mdash; The fir&s;t Symptom, that I &s;hall take notice of, by which a Per&s;on is known to labour under a <HI>Diabetes</HI> is the co|pious and frequent di&s;charge of pale colour'd
<PB N="21" REF="22">Urine. That this is an effect nece&s;&s;arily ari|&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;tate of the body will evi|dently appear from a little con&s;ideration. The <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts of the kidnies being in this relax'd morbid &s;tate, they will readily admit tho&s;e humours, which in a natural &s;tate by rea&s;on of the compactne&s;s of their texture, they would by no means give admittance to; and con&s;equently the di&s;charge mu&s;t be pro|portionably great. The little &s;tay the Se|creted humours make in the body will be the cau&s;e of their undergoing but a little change as to their colour and rancidity: Seeing that the colour and rancid &s;mell of the Urine, when evacuated in a healthy &s;tate of the bo|dy, are owing mo&s;t probably to its long re|tention in it; for by &s;uch a retention its oily parts become putrid, and will of cour&s;e put on a different complexion. <HI>Diabetical</HI> Urine then is &s;omewhat of a Chylous nature, and as all the <HI>nutritious</HI> juices are of a tenacious vi|&s;cid di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o they readily coagulate, when expos'd to the Atmo&s;phere; and to this &s;eems to be owing the rea&s;on of its ropy con&s;i|&s;tence.</P>
<P>That the quantity evacuated &s;hould exceed in proportion the quantity of liquors taken in, appears from what has been already ob|&s;erv'd;
<PB N="22" REF="23">for in this weakn'd &s;tate of the kid|nies, and broken condition of the blood, a great portion of tho&s;e juices, which &s;hould be retain'd in the body for its nouri&s;hment, will be admitted to pa&s;s through the kidnies, and of cour&s;e be thrown out of it, as tho' excre|mentitious; to which may be added the a|ctual increa&s;e of fluids ari&s;ing from a general wa&s;te of the Solids, which the kidnies being now enlarg'd will greedily receive. No won|der then, that the quantity evacuated &s;hould exceed in proportion the quantity of liquors taken in. A nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;uch a di&s;charge, (and becau&s;e in &s;uch circum&s;tances the important office of Nutrition is in a man|ner &s;u&s;pended,) will be lo&s;s of fle&s;h, and a great wa&s;te of the body, which is always ob|&s;ervable, when this di&s;order is far advanc'd, and the Patient almo&s;t brought by it to a period of his days; and it frequently happens in this la&s;t &s;tage of it that even &s;olid pieces of fle&s;h are brought away with the Urine.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of weakne&s;s about the Loyns mu&s;t be owing partly to this relaxation of the kidnies, and partly to the evacuation made; for in all drains whatever tho&s;e parts of the body &s;u&s;tain the greate&s;t lo&s;s of fluids, which are neare&s;t to that part, from which the drain
<PB N="23" REF="24">is made, and will con&s;equently be &s;en&s;ible of a proportionably greater weakne&s;s. The &s;ame complaint is made in other fluxes, in a <HI>go|norrhaea</HI> by Men, and the <HI>fluor albus</HI> by Wo|men; and the rea&s;on of it in both ca&s;es is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Symptom that comes next to be ac|counted for is the &s;weetne&s;s of the Urine.</P>
<P>As a different configuration of the parti|cles of the &s;ame body is well known to im|pre&s;s on the nervous <HI>Papillae</HI> of the Tongue different &s;en&s;ations; We conclude, and I think, very rea&s;onably, that the difference of the ta&s;tes of bodies is owing to &s;ome different tex|ture of their particles; but, as I apprehend, it is no very ea&s;y matter to determine <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> what particular di&s;po&s;ition or combination of the &s;everal parts, of which all bodies are known to con&s;i&s;t, is nece&s;&s;ary to make a body either <HI>&s;weet</HI> or <HI>bitter;</HI> &s;o till this can be a&s;certain'd, we mu&s;t be contented with this general ac|count of the &s;weetne&s;s of diabetical Urine; that it is owing to &s;ome different texture of its &s;everal heterogeneous parts.</P>
<P>Animal &s;ub&s;tances when putrefied give a faetid ta&s;te, and the rea&s;on of this is a&s;crib'd not only to their natural di&s;po&s;ition to give &s;uch a ta&s;te; but al&s;o to &s;ome different mo|dification
<PB N="24" REF="25">of their parts acquir'd in the Pro|ce&s;s of Putrefaction. <HI>Chemi&s;try</HI> teaches us, that all bodies are compos'd of the &s;ame E|lements, <HI>Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Salt,</HI> and <HI>Oil;</HI> and therefore the variety of their co|lour, &s;mell, ta&s;te, and the like, mu&s;t be ow|ing primarily to &s;ome different di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e Elements. We learn indeed from ob|&s;ervation, that the nearer the parts of any body approach to a &s;phaerical di&s;po&s;ition; the more mild and &s;oft is the ta&s;te of that bo|dy; and that the farther they recede from &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, the more acrid, and rough is the &s;en&s;ation, that &s;uch bodies excite in us.</P>
<P>That the ta&s;tes of bodies do depend upon a different combination of their particles is a truth not to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> in its &s;phaerical figure is both in|nocent, and ta&s;tle&s;s, but when &s;ublim'd, it lo&s;es its &s;phaericity, and becomes acrid, cor|ro&s;ive, and poi&s;onous.</P>
<P>An intire ma&s;s of
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Boyle's Mechanical production of ta&s;tes.</NOTE> <HI>Silver</HI> is in&s;ipid, but by being di&s;&s;olv'd in <HI>aqua fortis,</HI> and &s;hooting into Chry&s;talls, it becomes bitter; <HI>Lead</HI> ano|ther

<P>A mixture of Spirit of Nitre, and rectified Spirit of Wine, the former highly corro&s;ive, the latter very pungent, compo&s;es a body of an agreeable ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It appears then from experiments, that a different di&s;po&s;ition of the particles of bodies is the cau&s;e of that variety of ta&s;tes, which is ob&s;ervable in bodies, and that it will al&s;o ex|cite ta&s;tes in tho&s;e bodies, which before were in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>We have hitherto accounted for the &s;weet|ne&s;s of diabetical Urine, upon no other prin|ciples, than the original and primary cau&s;e of the difference of the ta&s;tes of natural bodies in general; and into this indeed mu&s;t all o|ther accounts of it be at la&s;t re&s;olv'd: For could we know the various mixtures the U|rine may po&s;&s;ibly undergoe in this &s;tate of the body; yet we &s;hould &s;till be at a lo&s;s to give a rea&s;on for the alterations ari&s;ing from &s;uch mixtures.</P>
<P>But to be more particular &mdash; It is known from ob&s;ervation, that the <HI>Inge&s;ta</HI> of what kind &s;oever, after they have been prepar'd and elaborated fine enough by the dige&s;tive

The milk, which the Infant &s;ucks from the Brea&s;ts of the Mother, is &s;weet; and even the blood it&s;elf is <HI>relatively</HI> &s;weet. It has been already ob&s;erv'd that a long re|tention of the humours in the body is the &s;ole cau&s;e of the rancidity of them; and it has been al&s;o &s;hewn that in a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> part of tho&s;e juices, which &s;hould be retain'd in the body for its nutrition, is thrown out of it, as tho' excrementitious; &s;o that the Urine in this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;omewhat of a Chylous na|ture, and as the &s;alt of Chyle or milk is &s;weet, &s;o the ta&s;te of the Urine mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;weet; &s;eeing that it has not been long enough cir|culating in the Ve&s;&s;els to acquire any degree either of rankne&s;s or Acrimony. This Chy|lous nature then of the Urine with a diffe|rent combination of its &s;everal parts will ea|&s;ily account for its remarkable &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>That a <HI>Diabetes</HI> &s;hould be attended with a hectick fever will appear evident from a con|&s;ideration of the known cau&s;es of it. But it would be foreign to my purpo&s;e to run through all the cau&s;es, by which this kind of fever is produc'd, and to &s;hew how nece&s;&s;arily a ca|chectical
<PB N="27" REF="28">body mu&s;t produce a Hectick. A very common cau&s;e of it however is an acri|mony in the blood, whether it be of the <HI>acid</HI> or <HI>alkaline</HI> kind, which by irritating and fret|ting the Solids will accelerate the circulation of the blood, in the accelerated cour&s;e of which is fixt the Idea of a &s;ever. The &s;ame irritation will happen from an <HI>ab&s;orption of Pus</HI> in ca&s;e of an inward Ulcer. But whe|ther or no there is &s;uch an <HI>ab&s;orption of Pus</HI> is at pre&s;ent a di&s;puted point: Tho', I think, there is all the rea&s;on, that can be de&s;ir'd, to re&s;olve it in the affirmative; and chiefly becau&s;e of that true <HI>purulent</HI> matter, with which the <HI>faeces</HI> in ulcerated ca&s;es are &s;ome|times known to be tinctur'd, even when there has been no Ulcer in the&s;e parts, and there|&s;ore could not po&s;&s;ibly have been evacuated by <HI>&s;tool;</HI> had it not been fir&s;t ab&s;orb'd into the blood. That there are Ve&s;&s;els in the hu|mane body capable of &s;uch <HI>ab&s;orption</HI> is grant|ed by every one; That <HI>Pe&s;tilential</HI> and other noxious <HI>efluvia</HI> are ab&s;orb'd by them, and com|municated to the blood, is often verified by fatal experience; That the drops of blood, which gu&s;h out from the rupture of a &s;mall artery, are al&s;o ab&s;orb'd into the ma&s;s of blood, every day's experience proves. As it is clear
<PB N="28" REF="29">then beyond all po&s;&s;ible doubt, that there is &s;uch an ab&s;orption of fluids into the blood, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on, why the <HI>Pus,</HI> which is di&s;charg'd from an Ulcer, may not al&s;o be ab|&s;orb'd.</P>
<P>That a great lo&s;s of blood will al&s;o bring on a Hectick, whether occa&s;ion'd by <HI>Haemor|rhoidal,</HI> or <HI>Dy&s;enterical</HI> fluxes, too plentiful <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> or the like, appears from ob&s;er|vation, and is confirm'd by experiment.</P>

<P>It is well known, that the Velocity, with which all fluids move through all known Ve&s;|&s;els, is reciprocal to the re&s;i&s;tance, which they meet with in their pa&s;&s;age through &s;uch Ve&s;|&s;els. Now this re&s;i&s;tance among other cau&s;es of it will be increas'd or dimini&s;h'd in pro|portion to the Quantity of fluids contain'd in the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els; for the greater the Quantity of fluids is contain'd for in&s;tance in tho&s;e Co|nical Ve&s;&s;els the arteries; the greater degree of force will be requir'd in the blood thrown out of the Heart to drive forward that alrea|dy in the arteries; and there will al&s;o be in &s;uch circum&s;tances a greater degree of fri|ction; the Quantity of blood then being di|mini&s;h'd, the&s;e re&s;i&s;tances, which are known to retard its progre&s;&s;ive motion, will be propor|tionably remov'd; and the motion of the blood then will now be more free, it will con&s;equent|ly be more quick; and as a quick circulation will cau&s;e a quick pul&s;e; and as the pul&s;e is de|nominated to be either &s;trong or weak in proportion to the greater or le&s;s di&s;ten&s;ion of the artery, which depends upon the Quanti|ty or den&s;ity of the blood; &s;o we may ea&s;ily collect the rea&s;ons from the&s;e known facts both of the weakne&s;s and quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e in Hectick Fevers; and <HI>how</HI> Preternatu|ral

<P>And here let it be remember'd, that the fir&s;t improvement, which the Science of Me|dicine receiv'd, was made by Rea&s;oning upon Mathematical Principles. This then pav'd the way for tho&s;e great di&s;coveries, which have lately been made in the nature of the <HI>Animal
<PB N="33" REF="34">Oeconomy</HI> by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mechanical ob|&s;ervations.
<Q>"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mead's preface to his book on Poi&s;ons.</NOTE> Nor could malice it&s;elf (as Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on the like occa&s;ion) deny this, were not ignorance in confedera|cy with it, which will &s;ecure any one from being benefitted by the mo&s;t u&s;eful Demon|&s;tration."</Q> And that this is not only the mo&s;t likely, but is without all po&s;&s;ible doubt, the only certain method of improving Phy&s;ical Knowledge, is evident from the &s;tructure of the humane body. For it appears by Anatomy to con&s;i&s;t of Solids and Fluids, both which are &s;ubject to the known Laws of <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Mo|tion,</HI> and therefore the various di&s;orders, to which this wonderful Fabric is hourly liable, can no way be more rationally accounted for, than by Mechanical Rea&s;onings, and the ap|plication of the&s;e Laws to &s;uch alterations, as are ob&s;ervable in it.</P>
<P>This method then of enquiring into the na|ture of the di&s;ea&s;es of the humane body, when it can be made u&s;e of, is the only certain one; I &s;ay, when it can be made u&s;e of; for there are &s;ome di&s;orders of &s;o complicated a nature, others again of &s;o peculiar a one, that they are not capable of being con&s;ider'd in this ad|vantageous
<PB N="34" REF="35">Light; or of being reduc'd to any known Principles, whereon to found our en|quiry. All that can po&s;&s;ibly be done in &s;uch unhappy ca&s;es is to be effected by a careful ob&s;ervation of the Symptoms produc'd, by a diligent attention to the efforts, which Na|ture endeavours to make for her own relief, and by a&s;&s;i&s;ting her in the &s;truggle by a due application of proper Remedies.</P>
<P><Q>"It is pa&s;t doubt with me, &s;ays
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In his account of the Non-Naturals p. 168.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Waine|wright,</HI> whatever &s;ome Phy&s;icians &s;ay again&s;t <HI>Theory,</HI> which they don't under&s;tand, that 'tis not only u&s;eful, but a nece&s;&s;ary Qualifica|tion of a good Phy&s;ician. For one that un|der&s;tands the &s;tructure of a Humane Body, the nature of the Solids and Fluids, the man|ner how animal actions are perform'd, the Nature of <HI>Secretion,</HI> the effect of either en|crea&s;ng or le&s;&s;ening any evacuation, the known Laws of Motion as apply'd to <HI>Mecha|nicks,</HI> and <HI>Hydro&s;taticks,</HI> with the applica|tion of them to the alterations made in Humane Bodies, is <HI>Caeteris paribus</HI> better qua|lified for a Phy&s;ician, than one who is igno|rant of the&s;e things."</Q></P>
