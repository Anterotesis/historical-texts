<HEAD>THE FOOL of Quality, OR, THE HISTORY OF HENRY EARL of <HI>Moreland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS my Lord, in the recent Ac|qui&s;ition of &s;uch a Son, forgot all his Lo&s;&s;es, and ca&s;t the whole Weight of his late Calamities behind him. His Eye could not be tired with &s;eeing him, neither his Ear with hearing the Sweetne&s;s of his Voice; and he continued to hold, to gaze at him, to care&s;s him, un|mindful of aught el&s;e, unmindful even of
<PB N="4" REF="3">his Friend <HI>Meekly,</HI> who &s;at enraptured be|&s;ide him.</P>
<P>Will you leave me again, my Child? cried out the Earl; do you intend to go from me again, my <HI>Harry?</HI> you mu&s;t not, you &s;hall not leave me, not for an Hour, no not for a Minute; a &s;econd Lo&s;s of my Son would quickly bring my grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave. Never, never, my Lord, will I leave you, tenderly cried <HI>Harry;</HI> never, for a Moment, will I for|&s;ake you again, my Father. I come pur|po&s;ely to watch over, to comfort, to tend you, while I have Life, with all po&s;&s;ible Tenderne&s;s, Affection and Duty.</P>
<P>But where, ha&s;tily a&s;ked the Earl, where is the Murderer who &s;tabbed my Peace? where is that old Thief, that Robber, who rent my Child from me? Ah! my Lord, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> he is very far from meriting &s;uch opprobrious Epithets; He is a Summary of all that is excellent, all that is amiable in Nature. He re&s;pects and loves you too, above the World, and all that is in it de&s;erving of Love. O, had you lately &s;een his Grief for your Lo&s;&s;es, the Floods of Tears he &s;hed,&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;for!&mdash;Here <HI>Harry</HI> could no more, but, on the Recollection of his Mother and Brother, bur&s;t into Tears.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
But tell me, my Dear, continued the Earl, tell me who and what he is, whom you commend &s;o highly?</P>
<P>Even the Son of your own Mother, my Lord; my much loved, my revered, my mo&s;t honoured Uncle.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, my Child. That old de&s;|picable Man my Brother. No no, my <HI>Harry,</HI> he mu&s;t have deceived you. My Brother was All that was amiable upon Earth; <HI>the Faire&s;t among ten Thou&s;and,</HI> the &s;traite&s;t Cedar in the Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>And &s;uch he is at this Day, my Lord. But, alas, alas, he has been broken by the Batteries of many Afflictions; a Man wholly made up of Sorrows, and acquaint|ed with killing Griefs. You wanted me not, when he took me, my Father. You had other and richer Trea&s;ures, Comforts that were infinitely more worthy your Regard. But, little and de&s;picable as I was, He had nothing but me. I became his only Comfort, the only Trea&s;ure in which he delighted. Yet, as &s;oon as he hear'd that you wanted Con&s;olation, he cho&s;e rather to be without it him&s;elf; and &s;o he re&s;tores me to you, if I may be any little Matter of Comfort to you, my Fa|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
And where is this dear Uncle, this precious Brother, my <HI>Harry?</HI> Is he come with you, &s;hall I be &s;o ble&s;&s;ed to take him in with my Eye, to take him in with my Arms, to petition, to obtain his Pardon, to pre&s;s him to my Bo&s;om, to my Heart, to my Soul, where is he, where is this pre|cious Brother, my <HI>Harry?</HI></P>
<P>He is not come with me, my Lord, he feared, as he &s;aid, that you would not forgive him the carrying off of your <HI>Gany|mede,</HI> but he is de&s;irous of attending you, on the fir&s;t Intimation.</P>
<P>Then you mu&s;t write to him, for that Purpo&s;e, to Morrow, my Son, and di&s;|patch your Invitation by &s;ome of our &s;wifte&s;t Hor&s;es. The Influence of his Darling will, unque&s;tionably, be greater than that of an offending and unnatural Brother. Is this Letter from him, <HI>Harry?</HI> &mdash; it is, my Lord. &mdash; Then, I will not peru&s;e it, till I get by my&s;elf. It probably contains Reproaches but too well merited; or, po&s;&s;ibly, Matters of Con&s;ola|tion, too tender for me to bear. &mdash; But, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> my deare&s;t <HI>Meekly,</HI> ten thou|&s;and Pardons! &mdash; <HI>Harry,</HI> take to your Arms the Man, in the World, next to your Uncle, mo&s;t de&s;erving of your Re|verence, mo&s;t de&s;erving of your Heart!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
Here, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> ki&s;&s;ed and embraced our Hero, with all the Tenderne&s;s of a Father and the Ardour of an old Friend.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> cried <HI>Harry,</HI> looking ear|ne&s;tly and fondly at him, do I not remem|ber &s;omething of that Face, Mr. <HI>Meekly?</HI> Are you not the Gentleman, for whom I, long &s;ince, conceived &s;uch an Attachment, to whom my Heart cleaved, as I may &s;ay, from my Infancy?</P>
<P>I am, my heavenly Creature, an&s;wered <HI>Meekly,</HI> I am the Man indeed who&s;e Soul was knit to yours, like the Soul of <HI>Jonathan</HI> to <HI>David,</HI> the fir&s;t Moment I beheld you; and who &s;aw in you, then, all tho&s;e noble, generous, and divinely humane Propen&s;i|ties, that I &s;ee arrived to their Maturity at this happy Day!</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> was thus rejoicing, <HI>Harry</HI> happened to turn his Head a&s;ide, and &s;pying the lively Portraits of my Lady and Lord <HI>Richard,</HI> he &s;tarted, he ro&s;e, and, gazing on them a Minute; he went &s;oftly to the Window, and, taking out his Handkerchief, kept his Back to the Company, while he vented his Emotions in a &s;ilent Pa&s;&s;ion of Tears. His Father and Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> perceived what he was about, but they did not di&s;turb him. He
<PB N="8" REF="7">brought fre&s;h to their Remembrance all the Pa&s;&s;ages of late Affliction, and they &s;ilently joined a Flow of Grief to his. But their Tears were the Tears of &s;ympathi&s;ing Humanity: or rather Tears of Delight, on ob&s;erving the &s;weet Sen&s;ibilities of their Darling.</P>
<P>In the mean Time Mr. <HI>Frank,</HI> who at|tended on <HI>Harry,</HI> had whi&s;peringly given the mourning Dome&s;tics an Intimation, concerning the Per&s;on of the Stranger who had arrived. Some of them well remem|bered him; and All of them had hear'd of him, and conceived a very kindly Impre&s;|&s;ion of our <HI>Harry.</HI> They fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed their mutual Joy, by Ki&s;&s;es, Embraces, and &s;ilent Shakes of the Hand; but, in a little Space, their Congratulations became more loud and tumultuous, and the Voice of Exultation was hear'd through all the lower Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> hereupon, felt him&s;elf &s;ecretly hurt, and turning to his Father his yet tearful Countenance, my Lord, &s;ays he, I be&s;eech you to &s;uppre&s;s this un&s;ea&s;onable Sound of Joy among your Servants, in a Hou&s;e that ought &s;o ju&s;tly to be the Hou&s;e of Mourning. &mdash; My Love, mildly and kindly an&s;wered the Earl, I cannot wholly refu&s;e, to my poor and afflicted People,
<PB N="9" REF="8">&s;ome Share of that Comfort which I my&s;elf feel on the Return of my <HI>Harry.</HI> They are All my old and true Servants, my Child, this is no other than an Expre&s;&s;ion of their Love to you and to me, and I reque&s;t you to receive them affectionately for my Sake.</P>
<P>Here the Earl rung a Bell, and de&s;ired tha tall his Dome&s;tics &s;hould come in.</P>
<P>They accordingly entered. <HI>Harry</HI> per|fectly recollected Mr. <HI>John,</HI> the Steward, Mr. <HI>Samuel,</HI> the Butler, and old Mrs. <HI>Mary,</HI> the Cook. He called them by their Names, reminded them of old Times, and took them in his Arms with much Affection. He then turned to the other Servants. He took Each of them by the Hand in Turns, and &s;poke to them, with &s;uch a natural Ea&s;e and Lowline&s;s, as though he him&s;elf de&s;ired, in his Father's Hou&s;e, to become al&s;o, <HI>as One of his hired Servants.</HI> Here|upon, gathering All about him, they catched and ki&s;&s;ed his Hand by Force; and then, kneeling around, they promi&s;|cuou&s;ly petitioned for Ble&s;&s;ings on his Head; and ri&s;ing, retired in a plea&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ion of Sobs and Tears; while the en|raptured Earl beheld All; with a Mixture of &s;uch bli&s;sful Sen&s;ations, as he had never felt before.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
It now began to grow late, and, after a &s;hort Repa&s;t of &s;ome &s;mall Matters; my Lord propo&s;ed their retiring to Bed, but, my Friend, &s;aid he to <HI>Harry,</HI> you mu&s;t content your&s;elf with being my Pri&s;oner for the pre&s;ent; you mu&s;t lie in my Cham|ber; I will not tru&s;t my Lamb from my Side, for Fear of its going once more a&s;tray. Ah, my Lord, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> there is no Fear of that. My Heart is wholly your Property, and you have, thereby, a &s;ure Hold of all that I am or can have.</P>
<P>The next Morning, <HI>Harry</HI> impatiently ro&s;e, before the Servants were &s;tirring; and unlocking the great Door, and clo&s;ing it &s;oftly after him, he went out exulting on his premeditated Expedition. He recon|noitred and recollected the quondam Scenes of his Childhood, and, flying like a Bird over the Hedges and other Ob&s;tacles, he made the &s;horte&s;t Way to his &s;till precious Mammy's.</P>
<P>When he approached the Place of his infant Endearments, he met his Fo&s;terfa|ther going forth to his Field, with a &s;o|lemn and melancholy Air, on his u&s;ual Oc|cupations. <HI>Harry</HI> in&s;tantly remembered the Features, once &s;o delightful, and &s;pring|ing to him, and catching at him, he ki&s;&s;ed and cla&s;ped him repeatedly, and cried a|loud, my Daddy, my Daddy, my dear,
<PB N="11" REF="10">dear Daddy <HI>Dob&s;on!</HI> how glad am I to &s;ee you once again! how is my Mammy, my dear Mammy? how is little <HI>Tommy</HI> and little <HI>Rachel,</HI> and all our dear Family?</P>
<P>The old Man then, re&s;pectfully with|drawing a Space, I don't know you, my &s;weet Ma&s;ter, &s;aid he; I never &s;aw you before. Indeed but you did; many and many a time and oft, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> you carried me in your Arms, almo&s;t the live|long Day, and pre&s;&s;ed and hu&s;hed me to &s;leep at Night in your Bo&s;om. Don't you remember, your little <HI>Harry?</HI> don't you remember my two Dogs, don't you re|member my Cock?</P>
<P>O, exclaimed the good old Man, I now believe that you are my Child, the deare&s;t Child that ever was born! But, I never hoped to &s;ee him &s;uch a Thing as you are; I never thought to &s;ee &s;uch a glorious Crea|ture upon Earth!</P>
<P>Here, old <HI>Dob&s;on</HI> returned <HI>Harry</HI>'s Ca|re&s;&s;es with a two-fold Force, and, blubber|ing all aloud, had like to have &s;mothered him with the Inten&s;ene&s;s of his Embraces.</P>
<P>Bring me, bring me, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> to the Sight of my deare&s;t Mammy, I am all impatient, to behold her!</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
Not &s;o fa&s;t, &s;aid Gaffer <HI>Dob&s;on,</HI> I love my old loving <HI>Cate,</HI> and, &s;hould &s;he find you out, of a &s;udden, &s;he would certainly die of Joy. But, I will bring you to her as a Stranger, and &s;o you may bring Matters about. And, indeed, I fear that my own Head is likely to be crazed by this Bu&s;ine&s;s; for I do not find that I am the &s;ame Man that I was a while agone, I &s;hall grow too proud, I doubt, and look down upon all my better Neighbours.</P>
<P>Goodman <HI>Dob&s;on</HI> then conducted <HI>Harry</HI> to their ancient Habitation. Nur&s;e <HI>Dob&s;on</HI> was ju&s;t up, and preparing to comb the Heads of her Children, when they entered.</P>
<P><HI>Cate,</HI> &s;ays he, I have brought to you a young Stranger, who &s;ays he can give you &s;ome Account of our little <HI>Harry,</HI> who &s;ays he is &s;till alive, notwith&s;tanding all your Frights, and will &s;hortly pay a Vi&s;it to &s;ome Parts of this Country; and who knows then, but that we, among Others, may happen to &s;et our Eyes upon him, and that, I think, would be a great Ble&s;&s;ing, my <HI>Cate?</HI></P>
<P>O, no, no, no, exclaimed Nur&s;e, with|out deigning to ca&s;t her Eyes on the Stran|ger; he is dead, he is gone from me the&s;e many many Years; I once hoped to have
<PB N="13" REF="12">his Infant on my Knee and in my Bo&s;om, but that Hope is quite gone; never, never &s;hall I behold my Darling again.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had &s;eated him&s;elf ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to Nur&s;e; when, looking up, &s;he &s;tarted, and &s;tared eagerly in his Face. Don't impo&s;e upon me, <HI>William,</HI> &s;ays &s;he; tell me, tell me at once, mayhap this is my Child! Ah, again&s;t the World, the Dimple in that Smile, is the Dimple of my <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Harry</HI> &s;prung up and, at one Leap, caught his ri&s;ing Nur&s;e in his Arms, cry|ing, my Mammy, my Mammy, my deare&s;t Mammy, do I live to be pre&s;&s;ed once more to your dear Bo&s;om!</P>
<P>But the poor Woman breathed &s;hort, and could not get out a Word. Twenty times &s;he put him from her, and catched him to her again, gazing at him, by In|tervals, with a frantic Affection. At length, &s;he ca&s;t her&s;elf back, on the Bench that was behind her, and, clapping her Hands together, &s;he gave a great Shout, and bur&s;t into an hy&s;terical Pa&s;&s;ion of Tears; while <HI>Harry</HI> &s;eated him&s;elf be&s;ide her, and gently drawing her Head to him, placed it fondly on his Bo&s;om, and mixed his Tears with her's.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
This Gu&s;h came very &s;ea&s;onably for our loving Nur&s;e's Relief. She &s;oon recovered her Breath and her Sen&s;es; and, &s;eeing &s;ome Drops on her <HI>Harry</HI>'s Cheeks, &s;he drew them in with her Lips, crying, pre|cious Pearls be the&s;e! I would not exchange One of them for the brighte&s;t Diamond in the Mines.</P>
<P>Mammy, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> I &s;tole away to come and &s;ee you, while my Father was a&s;leep, or el&s;e I &s;hould not have had Leave to &s;tir from him a Foot. But You and my Daddy mu&s;t promi&s;e to come and dine with me, we will have a Table by Our|&s;elves. And do You, my dear Mammy, &s;tep to our Hou&s;e, and, if my Father &s;hould mi&s;s me, tell him I am gone into the Town and will be back with him before Breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then &s;tepped to the Village, and, remembering Gaffer <HI>Truck</HI>'s Hou&s;e, he went familiarly in, and enquired of the good Woman how all the Family was. Pray, how is my hone&s;t old <HI>Bartholemew,</HI> &s;ays he, and how is your pretty Daughter <HI>Molly,</HI> and above all what is become of my old Friend <HI>Tom?</HI> The poor Woman, all in Amazement, cried, a pretty <HI>Tom</HI> he is for|&s;ooth, to be Friend to &s;uch a &s;weet young Gentleman as You are. But Truth is that
<PB N="15" REF="14">our <HI>Tom</HI> is at prentice to a Barber at next Door. Well, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> when Gaffer <HI>Truck</HI> comes Home, tell him that his old Acquaintance, <HI>Harry Clinton,</HI> called to &s;ee him.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> had ju&s;t fini&s;hed an Operation on a Neighbour, as our Hero entered. How are you <HI>Tom,</HI> &s;ays he, carele&s;sly. <HI>Tom</HI> gaped, and &s;tared, and gaped; but an&s;wered not a Word. Will you give me a Ca&s;t of your Office, <HI>Tom?</HI> Ay, that I will, Ma&s;ter, as &s;oon you get a Beard. Why, <HI>Tom,</HI> you are grown a huge hulking Fellow &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t; will you &s;tep to yonder Green and wre&s;tle one Fall with me? No, no, Ma&s;ter, I &s;hould hurt you; methinks I could throw a Dozen of &s;uch fairweather Gentlemen as You are, Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> in&s;tantly &s;eized <HI>Tom,</HI> by the Brea&s;t with one Hand, and by the Shoulder with the Other; when <HI>Tom,</HI> feeling the Hard|ne&s;s and Hurt of his Gripe, immediately ex|erted his Powers, and grappled with his Adver&s;ary. But <HI>Harry,</HI> giving him a &s;light Foot, laid him on the broad of his Back in the Middle of his own Floor; but kept him, with both Hands, from being hurt again&s;t the Ground.</P>
<P>I believe, &s;aid <HI>Tom,</HI> ri&s;ing, You mu&s;t zertainly be the Devil; and come, as they
<PB N="16" REF="15">&s;ay, to fling poor Sinners in the Shape of an Angel of Light. Ah, <HI>Tom, Tom,</HI> cried <HI>Harry,</HI> this is not the fir&s;t Struggle that you and I have had. Do you remember the Bag of Nuts and poor blind <HI>Tommy?</HI> have you forgot your old Friend, your lit|tle <HI>Harry Clinton?</HI></P>
<P>Ble&s;s'd Mercy! exclaimed <HI>Tom,</HI> can you be my young Lord, my Heart's dear young Ma&s;ter? I am indeed, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> your old Acquaintance, my dear <HI>Tom,</HI> your loving Friend, <HI>Harry Clinton.</HI> And &s;o &s;aying, he took <HI>Tom</HI> about the Neck and ki&s;&s;ed him very cordially.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> I want you to take a Walk with me; <HI>Tom</HI> in&s;tantly a&s;&s;ented, and out they went.</P>
<P>As they walked along, <HI>Harry</HI> began to grow &s;ad. <HI>Tom,</HI> &s;aid he, do you know where my dear Brother <HI>Dickey</HI> was buried? Yes, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Tom,</HI> a great Way off, in yonder Church Yard below the Town's End. Do you know where the Sexton lives, <HI>Tom?</HI> In a little white Hou&s;e, Sir, ju&s;t joining the Yard.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they arrived, <HI>Tom</HI> called out the Sexton, and <HI>Harry,</HI> putting a Guinea into his Hand, ordered him directly to un|lock the Family Vault.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
The Man looked a&s;toni&s;hed, but obey|ed in Silence, and <HI>Harry,</HI> as he entered, de&s;ired the Sexton and <HI>Tom</HI> to wait at a Di&s;tance, and promi&s;ed to be with them, by and by.</P>
<P>He put to the Door after him, ju&s;t leav|ing Light enough to di&s;tingui&s;h the recent Depo&s;its of the Dead.</P>
<P>O, &s;aid he, as he advanced, thou true Hou&s;e of Mourning, thou &s;ilent End of all Men, how &s;ad art thou to Sen&s;e! how &s;ad to me above All, who beare&s;t in thy dark Bo&s;om &s;uch precious and beloved Relicks.</P>
<P>Then, ca&s;ting him&s;elf on the Coffins of my Lady and Lord <HI>Richard,</HI> as they lay Side by Side; and cla&s;ping his Arms about them as far as he could reach; O, he cried, my Mother, my Brother, my deare&s;t Bro|ther, my deare&s;t Mother, you are gone, you are gone from me, and You never knew the Love that your Son and Brother had for You. Ah, how did I flatter my|&s;elf, what Happine&s;s did I not propo&s;e, in attending, &s;erving, and plea&s;ing You; in doing thou&s;ands of tender, kindly and en|dearing Offices about You! but you are &s;natched from me, my Mother, you are &s;natched from me, my Brother! all my Pro&s;pects are defeated and cut away for
<PB N="18" REF="17">ever. You will no more return to me, but I &s;hall go to You; and O, that I were laid with You this Minute in this &s;till and peaceful Man&s;ion; where Hopes and Fears cea&s;e, and All are humbled together!</P>
<P>Mean while, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> and gone abroad on his Morning's Walk. He met Nur&s;e on her Way to the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, and, acco&s;ting her in a kind of Triumph, my good Nur&s;e, &s;ays he, we have ble&s;&s;ed Ti|dings for you, Your <HI>Harry,</HI> your Hero, is come to the Country. I know it, Sir, I know it, an&s;wered Nur&s;e, it is but a little while ago that my Babe left my Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> then proceeded in order to join his young Friend, enquiring of All he met which Way Lord <HI>Henry</HI> went, till at la&s;t he was directed to the Church Yard. There he found <HI>Tom</HI> and the Sexton who, on further Que&s;tion, &s;ilently pointed to the Door of the Family Vault, that hung on the jar.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> felt him&s;elf affected, and withdrew to a greater Di&s;tance; but &s;till keeping his tearful Eye on the &s;ad Man|&s;ion that now held the Living with the Dead.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Harry</HI> came forth, drying his Cheeks with his Handkerchief. He a&s;&s;um|ed
<PB N="19" REF="18">a con&s;trained Air of Chearfulne&s;s, and joining <HI>Tom</HI> and the Sexton, ob&s;erved that a great Crowd was gathering in the Town.</P>
<P>Who are Tho&s;e, <HI>Tom?</HI> &s;ays he; I &s;up|po&s;e, an&s;wered <HI>Tom,</HI> your Honour's Te|nants and old Acquaintances, who are get|ting together to welcome You to the Coun|try. If that is the Ca&s;e, <HI>Tom,</HI> we mu&s;t go and &s;alute them; and You &s;hall intro|duce me and tell me who is who.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> perceiving that <HI>Harry</HI> was on his Return, kept onward, aloof from him, but with an Eye on his Motions.</P>
<P>By this Time, the Crowd had &s;orted them&s;elves, the Principals of the Families into one Group, the young Men into Ano|ther, and the fair Maidens into Another. And, as <HI>Harry</HI> approached, They all &s;et up a joint Shout of Triumph.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e your Honour, &s;ays <HI>Tom,</HI> this is my Father; and this is Gaffer <HI>Gubbins,</HI> and this Goodman <HI>Dem&s;ter,</HI> and this Far|mer <HI>Fel&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o on.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> with the Lowline&s;s of a Wa&s;her of Feet, would have ki&s;&s;ed and embraced them All in Turns; but, pre&s;&s;ing about him, they &s;eized a Hand on either Side,
<PB N="20" REF="19">and eagerly ki&s;&s;ed them, as al&s;o the Skirts of his Clothes all round.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s your &s;weet Face, God ble&s;s your &s;weet Face! cried Goodman <HI>Dem&s;ter,</HI> who &s;o &s;ees it in a Morning, can't fail, I think, of pro&s;pering the live-long Day.</P>
<P>When he came, in Succe&s;&s;ion, to the Companions of his Infancy, as he ki&s;&s;ed and &s;hook Hands with Each, in turn; Some reminded him of his having beat them at Boxing, Others at Wre&s;tling, and All of his having play'd with them at Pri|&s;on-Bars, Leapfrog, Shoot the Gate, and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Girls panted, gazed at him, and longed to get him to them&s;elves. Sir, &s;ays <HI>Tom,</HI> here is your old Acquain|tance, my Si&s;ter <HI>Molly;</HI> there is not a Lad, in the Town, whom &s;he is not able to to&s;s, except your Honour. <HI>Molly</HI> looked full of Health as <HI>Haebe,</HI> and ro&s;ey as the May, and <HI>Harry</HI> caught her about the Neck and ki&s;&s;ed her very cordially. Do you remem|ber me, <HI>Molly?</HI> O, an&s;wered <HI>Molly,</HI> I &s;hall never forget, &s;ince your Honour's Lord&s;hip and I u&s;ed to wre&s;tle every Day behind our Hou&s;e. Ay, <HI>Molly,</HI> cried <HI>Harry,</HI> there was no Harm in it then; but a Fall, at this Day, might be Dangerous to One of us; above all things take Care of that,
<PB N="21" REF="20">my good <HI>Molly.</HI> And, if you know ere a pretty Lad, to whom you have a Liking, I will give You fifty Guineas, for old Ac|quaintance &s;ake, toward making up your Portion.</P>
<P>The Re&s;t of the Girls now pre&s;&s;ed for their Share of <HI>Harry,</HI> and it was with Dif|ficulty that he divided him&s;elf with any &s;atisfactory Equality among them, as they All ki&s;&s;ed him &s;o clo&s;e, and &s;eemed &s;o loth to part.</P>
<P>At length, <HI>Harry</HI>'s Watch reminded him that it was Time to attend his Father, and, as he parted, they &s;houted after him, long Life and Health and Honours, to our Town&s;man, our own Boy, our own dear &s;weet Child!</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> had re|turned Home, with his Heart full of Ti|dings to the Earl. When <HI>Harry</HI> arrived, Breakfa&s;t was on Table, and he perceived that his Father had been in Tears. But, no Notice was taken of the Affair at the Charnel Hou&s;e, on either Part.</P>
<P>When Breakfa&s;t was over, <HI>Harry</HI> called in <HI>John.</HI> Mr. <HI>John,</HI> &s;ays he, can you tell me how many Families there are in this Village of Yours? Twenty five Families exactly, my Lord. Then <HI>Harry</HI> turned to
<PB N="22" REF="21">his Father and &s;aid, if your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;ed to lend me five hundred Guineas for the pre&s;ent, I will pay you very hone&s;t|ly the Hour that my Uncle comes to the Country. Why, Sirrah, cried the Earl plea&s;antly, what Right has your Uncle to pay your Debts, e&s;pecially to &s;uch a great Amount as you &s;peak of? O, my Lord, an|&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> I have already &s;quandered away above fifty thou&s;and Pounds of his Money, and this is but a Trifle which, I am &s;ure, I may very &s;afely add to the Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Here the Earl looked truely a&s;toni&s;hed. Fifty thou&s;and Pounds! he exclaimed, impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>Harry.</HI> Why, you had nei|ther &s;uch Ponds or Lakes, as mine, in <HI>London,</HI> wherein you might make Ducks and Drakes of them. How, in the World, could you contrive it, where did you di&s;|po&s;e of them?</P>
<P>In Ho&s;pitals and in Pri&s;ons, my Father, an&s;wered <HI>Harry.</HI> In Streets and Highways, among the Wretched and the Indigent. Supplying Eyes to the Blind, and Limbs to the Lame; and Chearfulne&s;s to the Sorrowful and broken of Heart; for &s;uch was my Uncle's Orders.</P>
<P>Let me go, let me go from this Place, my Lord, cried <HI>Meekly!</HI> this Boy will ab|&s;olutely kill me, if I &s;tay any longer. He
<PB N="23" REF="22">overpowers, he &s;uffocates me with the Weight of his Sentiments.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, go to my De&s;k, here is the Key of the Drawer on the left Hand, and I make you a Pre&s;ent of the Key and the Contents; perhaps you may find there nearly as much as will an|&s;wer your pre&s;ent Exigencies.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> went and, opening the Drawer, was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee it quite full of Gold. However he took no more than ju&s;t the Sum propo&s;ed and, returning to his Fa|ther, &s;aid, what &s;hall I do, my Lord, with that va&s;t Heap of Money? Why, you ex|travagant Rogue, replied the Earl, there is not as much in it as will pay the Debt you have contracted with one Man. O, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> I am quite ea&s;y upon that Score; I will never affront my Uncle by the Offer of a Penny. And, don't you think, &s;aid the Earl, that we have got Poor among us in the Country, as well as you have in the City, <HI>Harry?</HI> I believe you may have got Some, my Lord, but then I am much more difficult, than you may think, in the Objects on whom I would choo&s;e to confer Charity. I look upon the Money, ama&s;&s;ed by the Wealthy, to have been already extracted from the Earnings of the Poor, the poor Farmer, the poor Craftsman, the hard-handed Pea|&s;ant,
<PB N="24" REF="23">and the Day Labourer, who&s;e &s;even Children perhaps &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the Milk of a Couple of Cows. Wherefore, the Ob|jects, on whom we be&s;tow the&s;e Gather|ings, ought at lea&s;t to be &s;omething poor|er, and more worthy of Compa&s;&s;ion than Tho&s;e from whom the Money was exacted. So &s;aying, he &s;tepped out.</P>
<P>Amazing Boy! cried Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> how new, and yet how ju&s;t was that Ob&s;erva|tion! I am, cried the Earl, as it were in a Kind of delicious Dream, and can &s;carce yet believe my&s;elf &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to be the Father of &s;uch a Child!</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Harry</HI> had called <HI>John</HI> a&s;ide. Mr. <HI>John,</HI> &s;ays he, here are five hundred Guineas. Be plea&s;ed to &s;tep and di&s;tribute them by twenty Guineas to Each of the Families in the Village. I would &s;ave you the Trouble, and give them my|&s;elf, but that, for the pre&s;ent, my Heart turns with Di&s;gu&s;t from their Thanks and their Honours. Tell them that this is a Token, in Memory of my dear Brother, to keep them in mind of him. Tell them further that I will have no Carou&s;als, no Rejoycings, on Account of my Arrival; and that it would plea&s;e me infinitely bet|ter, if my Return would bring their late Lo&s;&s;es to their Remembrance, and &s;et them All in Tears and Lamentations.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
My Lord now propo&s;ed a Saunter into the Park, in order to procure an Appetite for Dinner. Accordingly the Gate was ordered to be unlocked; and they entered on a Gravel Walk, that was walled in on the left Hand, and paled in on the Right, along the Verge of five Canals that fell, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in Ca&s;cades, the One into the Other. Beyond the Canals, a va&s;t Lawn fled the Eye, thinly inter&s;per&s;ed with Trees of different Hues and Natures. The Lawn again was clo&s;ed by an exten&s;ive Lake; and, on the further Side of the Lake, there ro&s;e and &s;unk &s;everal Glens, that varied their Forms to the Pro&s;pect, as they walked. Beyond the Glens there aro&s;e, again, to the Eye, a huge Fore&s;t of time-immemorial Oaks. And, beyond All, there a&s;cended a Range of romantic Moun|tains, who&s;e Fronts were whitened here and there with impending Rocks; but who&s;e Tops &s;caled the Heavens, and con|founded their Forms and Colours with the Clouds.</P>
<P>As they talked and walked along, they met with a &s;ix barred Gate that directly thwarted their Pa&s;&s;age; and my Lord reached his Hand, through the Rails, for the Key, that the Keeper had left in the Lock on the in|&s;ide, but he could not get at it. We are All at a full Stop now, &s;aid he, unle&s;s <HI>Harry</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25">could make a Shift to climb over the Gate; but no, don't, my Dear, your Foot might happen to &s;lip between the Rails and hurt you. I will obey your Lord&s;hip, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> I will not venture a Foot upon One of them. So &s;aying, he catched at the topmo&s;t Bar with his left Hand, and, throwing him&s;elf &s;lightly over, opened the Gate for his Companions. The Earl and Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> &s;tood mute, in utter A&s;toni&s;h|ment. At length the Earl cried, Child, you mu&s;t &s;urely be of more than mortal Mould, or el&s;e you have a familiar Spirit that conveys you through the Air. I have indeed a familiar Spirit, my Lord, an&s;wer|ed <HI>Harry,</HI> a Spirit much humbled by the Sen&s;e of its own Defects.</P>
<P>On their Return, <HI>John</HI> called his Ma&s;ter a&s;ide, and told him of his due Di&s;tribution of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Bounty to the Villagers. But my Lord, &s;aid he, when I went down I found them All very bu&s;ily employed, in prepar|ing Bonfires and Illuminations in Honour of my young Lord. This, however, I was obliged to countermand, by his &s;pecial Order; and it has greatly mortified all your poor People. Well, well, &s;aid the Earl, it can't be helped for the pre&s;ent; we mu&s;t not dare to offend our <HI>Harry</HI> at any Rate; and &s;o tho&s;e Matters of Rejoy|cing may re&s;t in Re&s;erve till the Arrival of my Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
Soon afterward, our Hero's Fo&s;terers came, decked out in their be&s;t Attire; and <HI>Harry</HI> ordered a &s;ide Table to be covered for him and them, but my Lord in&s;i&s;ted on their dining all together.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> placed him&s;elf very lovingly be|tween them, at Table, that he might help them and prevail upon their Ba&s;hfulne&s;s to eat.</P>
<P>When the Repa&s;t was nearly over, Nur&s;e enquired after the little Beggar-Boy, who&s;e Ab&s;ence, &s;he imagined, had cau&s;ed the Elopement of her Darling. He is come to great Fortune, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> he has found his Father and Mother, and is Heir to a large E&s;tate. <HI>Harry</HI> then told the Manner in which <HI>Ned</HI> had been di&s;covered, and they were All highly plea&s;ed and affect|ed by the Relation.</P>
<P>But Mammy, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> what is be|come of my Si&s;ter <HI>Nelly</HI> on who&s;e Milk I was &s;uckled? and what is become of my little Brother <HI>Tommy,</HI> who was but two Years younger than my&s;elf?&mdash;They are both dead, my Precious; but God has been plea&s;ed to give me Others in their Room. &mdash; Well, Mammy, I find we mu&s;t all die, and, &s;ome time or other, that
<PB N="28" REF="27">will be a great Grief to One of us, which|ever of us &s;hall happen to outlive the Other. I am &s;atisfied to die once, &s;aid Nur&s;e, but, never let me hear again of your dying, my Angel, I can't &s;uffer the Thought, &s;he cried, and bur&s;t forth into Tears; I cou'dn't bear, I cou'dn't bear to die a thou&s;and Deaths in the Death of my <HI>Harry!</HI></P>
<P>But, Mammy, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> in order to divert her Pa&s;&s;ion, you have not yet en|quired after the Man with the Beard. O, the old Rogue, exclaimed Nur&s;e, I can't think of him with Patience. Ay, but, Mammy, you mu&s;t know that, that &s;ame old Rogue is my own darling Uncle, an own and only dear Brother to my own dear Father here. If that is the Ca&s;e, &s;aid Nur&s;e, I don't wonder he &s;hould &s;o great|ly yearn after you; and indeed I would rather wonder if all the World did not yearn and long after you, my Love!</P>
<P>And now, Mammy, to &s;hew you how much you are obliged to this &s;ame darling Uncle, he has ordered me to make you a Pre&s;ent of five hundred Pounds, in Pay|ment, as he &s;ays, of the Grief he has co&s;t you. And take no Heed for your Children, Mammy, I will take that Care upon my|&s;elf; for this &s;ame dear Uncle has made me a Gift of the Lands, and Hou&s;e, and Plate, and Furniture that he has in this
<PB N="29" REF="28">Town, and &s;o you &s;ee I am well able to provide for you All.</P>
<P>Here, my Lord ca&s;t an Eye of tender Jealou&s;y upon <HI>Harry.</HI> I perceive, my Son, &s;aid he, that your Uncle is your only Tru&s;t, the only Dependance that you choo&s;e to have upon Earth. <HI>Harry,</HI> with a Glance of his Eye, in&s;tantly caught the Meaning of the Eye of his Father; and, throwing him&s;elf at his Feet, O, pardon, my Lord, he cried, pray, pardon the Overflowings of a grateful and &s;imple Heart! My Uncle is my Property, but I am your's, my Father, to be di&s;po&s;ed of in Life, and in Death, at your Plea&s;ure. I do tru&s;t, I do depend upon you, my Father, and you have already over|power'd me with the Weight of your Af|fections.</P>
<P>My Lord's Eyes then gli&s;tened, and rai&s;|ing his Son, and taking him fondly to his Bo&s;om, I believe I have been wrong, my Love, &s;aid he; and hereafter I &s;hall always think &s;o, rather than think any thing ami&s;s in my <HI>Harry.</HI> But, tell me, my Dear, and tell me &s;incerely; you &s;peak of your Uncle, as One of the riche&s;t and greate&s;t Men upon Earth; as a Prince, as an Em|peror, enabled to give away Fortunes and Provinces at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
And he is, my Lord, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> he is greater than any Prince or Emperor upon Earth. To &s;peak only of his temporal Wealth and Power, the mo&s;t incon&s;idera|ble Part of his Value. He can do, as I may &s;ay, what he plea&s;es in <HI>England.</HI> The Mini&s;try are at his Beck, they profe&s;s them|&s;elves his Servants; and even his Maje&s;ty acknowledges him&s;elf deeply his Debtor, and owes him, I dare &s;ay, Half a Million of &s;terling <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>And yet this is the Man, exclaimed the Earl, (turning an Eye of Penitence on Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI>) this is the Man, as I told you, my Friend, on whom I looked down with &s;uch provoking Contempt; whom I treated with &s;uch unpardonable In&s;olence and Ig|nominy.</P>
<P>My Lord then enquired concerning the per&s;onal Adventures of our Hero in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> the Account of which would have been more entertaining, had not <HI>Harry</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, throughout his Narration, whatever he apprehended might tend to his own Honour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Fo&s;terers had taken their leave, my Lord propo&s;ed a Walk to his Gue&s;ts, in the Gardens; and, after a few Turns, they &s;at down in a rural Arbour, that was interwoven, all about, with Je&s;&s;a|mine and Honey&s;uckle.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">
Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, I have often longed to hear the Particulars of your Life, and how you came to live by Faith and not by Sight, and to hold your Conver&s;a|tion in Heaven, as you do at this Day.</P>
<P>I can &s;oon obey your Lord&s;hip, an&s;wer|ed <HI>Meekly,</HI> for my Story is very &s;hort and very &s;imple, and no way adorned with un|common Incidents.</P>
<P>My Mother died a few Hours after I was born. My Father did not &s;urvive her two Years; and I fell to the Care of my only Kin&s;man, an Uncle by my Father's Side.</P>
<P>My Uncle was an old Batchelor, and though he was of a cold Temper and had no Tenderne&s;s for any One, he yet &s;pared no Co&s;t in my Education. He &s;ent me to <HI>Eaton</HI> School, and from thence to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where I remained till I took my Degrees. I then went to <HI>London,</HI> bought a Sword and Sword-Knot, and commenced fine Gentleman.</P>
<P>Though my Head had been duly &s;tored, by my Tutors, in the Rudiments of our Religion, my Heart had not yet felt any of its Precepts; and I conceived that, to go regularly to Church, receive the Sacra|ment, confe&s;s my&s;elf a mi&s;erable Sinner,
<PB N="32" REF="31">and avoid gro&s;s Vices, was the Sum of Chri&s;tianity. I therefore entered, without Scruple, into all the fa&s;hionable Plea&s;ures and Vanities of the Age; and I held that, to pardon an Affront, would have been One of the deadly Sins, in a <HI>Gentleman-Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>One Day, at <HI>James</HI>'s Coffeehou&s;e, Colo|nel <HI>Stannard</HI> and another Gentleman en|gaged, at Backgammon, for five hundred Guineas; and, as the Stake was &s;o con&s;i|derable, and both Parties celebrated for their Skill in the Game, we all crowded about them, to &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>I happened to be next behind the Colo|nel's Chair, and Others pre&s;&s;ed behind me, eagerly bending and looking over my Shoulders. At length he began to fret, as the Game was drawing to a Clo&s;e and go|ing again&s;t him. Pray, Gentlemen, he would cry, don't bear upon me &s;o; for Heaven's Sake keep off, you will make me lo&s;e the Game. Hereupon, I did my utmo&s;t to bear back from him, but the Company pre&s;&s;ed me forward, in Spite of all I could do. Till the Colonel, giving an unhappily deci&s;ive Ca&s;t, turned about in a Fury, and &s;pit directly in my Face.</P>
<P>Indignation gave me &s;udden and unu&s;al Strength, and, ca&s;ting All off who had
<PB N="33" REF="32">borne upon me, I in&s;tantly drew my Sword and ran the Colonel through the Body. The Company cried out that all was fair, and opening a Window for me, they urged me to e&s;cape. Accordingly I got off, rode Po&s;t to <HI>Dover,</HI> and there embarqued for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Colonel, God be prai&s;ed, did not die of his Wound. He lay under the Hands of the Doctors for about &s;even Months, then recovered and went to join his Regiment in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Of this my Uncle &s;ent me Advice, tell|ing me at the &s;ame Time that I might re|turn with &s;afety. Yes, thought I, with &s;afety to my Life, but with Death to my Honour! I have taken Revenge indeed, but not Satisfaction; the Colonel mu&s;t be compelled to make me per&s;onal Reparation for the Affront which he dared to put upon me. His Recovery has again da&s;hed the Spit into my Face; and I will pur&s;ue him through the World, till it is wiped from the Ob&s;ervation and Remembrance of all Men.</P>
<P>With this deadly Determination, I went Po&s;t, from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and traced the Colonel from Place to Place, till I found him in a Village, on the Road to <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
I believe, Sir, &s;aid I bluntly, you mayn't remember me, for our Acquaintance was &s;udden and of very &s;hort Duration; I am the Man in who&s;e Face you &s;pit publickly, at <HI>James</HI>'s Coffeehou&s;e. Then, Sir, &s;aid he, I am &s;carce yet recovered of the Cau&s;e which you gave me to bear you always in Mind; but pray, what may your Com|mands be with me, for the pre&s;ent? I am come to demand a Remedy, at your Hands, for the Wound which you gave my Ho|nour, and which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t remain for ever incurable. Ah, he cried, no Man ever exacted &s;o &s;evere a Satisfaction as you have already taken; what then may be the Nature of the further Reparation, that you are plea&s;ed to require? Either to a&s;k my Pardon, or fight me within this Hour.</P>
<P>That is very hard upon me, indeed, re|plied the Colonel; the Honour of my Com|mi&s;&s;ion will not allow me to beg Pardon of any Man, at lea&s;t in order to avoid a Combat; &s;o Sir, if you in&s;i&s;t upon it, I mu&s;t obey your Summons, though very reluctantly, I confe&s;s. Then Sir, &s;aid I, meet me in Half an Hour, with your Pi&s;|tols and Sword, behind yonder little Hill.</P>
<P>The Colonel was punctual to the Ap|pointment. We both gra&s;ped a Pi&s;tol, at a Di&s;tance of twenty Paces, and advancing,
<PB N="35" REF="34">Step by Step, cried fire! fire! fire! Each &s;eeming determined to make &s;ure of his Ad|ver&s;ary; till, coming within Arm's length, I fired directly in his Face, but the Ball pa&s;&s;ed through his Hat, and only grazed the Skin of his left Temple.</P>
<P>The Colonel then took his Pi&s;tol into his left Hand, and reaching out his Right to me, with a Smile of great Complacence, I think Sir, &s;aid he, I may now a&s;k your Pardon with Honour And to convince you that I did not come to engage You in Malice, be plea&s;ed to examine my Arms, you will not find &s;o much as a Grain of Powder in the One or the Other.</P>
<P>Ah, Colonel, I then exclaimed, I acknow|ledge you my Conqueror both in Honour and Humanity. Had I been &s;o unhappy as to kill you, and find your Arms unload|ed, I &s;hould certainly have done you Ju&s;|tice, by &s;hooting my&s;elf through the Head. But, why did I pur&s;ue you from Kingdom to Kingdom; why was I unappea&s;ed by all the Blood that I &s;hed? was it from any Malignity of Heart toward you? by no Means; but, while I lamented the Mi&s;ery I had already occa&s;ioned You, I was impel|led to fini&s;h your De&s;truction, by a barba|rian World, or rather, by the bloody Pre|&s;cribers of Cu&s;tom, who&s;e Cen&s;ure I dread|ed, wor&s;e than Death, or even Futurity.
<PB N="36" REF="35">Courage, Colonel, incites Soldiers to fight for their Country; but it is Cowardi&s;e alone that drives Duelli&s;ts together.</P>
<P>For three affectionate Days, I remained with my late Enemy, but now warm Friend. He then was obliged to return to Quarters; and we parted, with a Regret much ex|ceeding the Ho&s;tility with which we had met.</P>
<P>On the Departure of the Colonel I went to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> from whence I drew upon my Uncle to the amount of &pound;700. For I re&s;olved, before my Return, to take a Tour through the Seven Provinces, though I had gone for a very different Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>During nine Months I re&s;ided, or jour|neyed from Place to Place, among that People. <HI>Holland</HI> is, unque&s;tionably, the wealthie&s;t, the bu&s;ie&s;t, and mo&s;t populous State upon Earth. Not a Hand is unem|ployed, not a Foot of Ground unoccupied; and, for a long time, I a&s;cribed their ex|traordinary Pro&s;perity to an Indu&s;try and Ingenuity peculiar to them alone. But, on further Ob&s;ervation, I di&s;covered the true Source as well of their Indu&s;try as their Opulence, and am per&s;uaded that any Na|tion, bordering on the Ocean, might de|rive the like Pro&s;perity from the &s;ame Spring.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">
Not, my Lord, that I think Opulence a real Benefit to a People, for <HI>Man's Life con&s;i&s;teth not in the Abundance of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</HI> But I look upon Indu&s;try, the natural Pa|rent of Opulence, to be as well a Ble&s;&s;ing as a Duty to Man, from the Time that he was appointed to <HI>earn his Bread in the Sweat of his Brow.</HI> Many mental Virtues, al&s;o, as well as temporal Benefits follow in the Train of Indu&s;try; it makes Men health|ful, brave, hone&s;t, &s;ocial, and pacific. He, who labours hard to acquire a Pro|perty, will &s;truggle hard to pre&s;erve it, and Exerci&s;e will make him active, robu&s;t and able for the Purpo&s;e. As the Man of In|du&s;try hath, in him&s;elf, a living Fund of Competence for his own Occa&s;ions, he will be the le&s;s tempted to plunder or prey up|on Others; and the poignant Sen&s;e and Apprehen&s;ion of being deprived of a Pro|perty, &s;o ju&s;tly acquired, will give him the nicer and &s;tronger Sen&s;e of &s;uch an Injury to Others. Indu&s;try further incites to Commerce and good Neighbourhood, in order to di&s;po&s;e of mutual Redundancies for the Supply of mutual Wants. And, la&s;tly, it delighteth in Peace, that its Time and its Labours may not be interrupted, nor the Fruits thereof endangered, by Rapine and Inva&s;ion; and all this may be &s;aid of Nations, as well as of Men.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
Your Ob&s;ervations, &s;aid the Earl, are perfectly ju&s;t; the Works of Indu&s;try are, unque&s;tionably, the Works of Peace, and tend to open the Avenues wherein the Vir|tues may walk. But, how to incite Men or Nations to Indu&s;try, that is the Que&s;|tion. The finer Arts, we &s;ee, may be en|couraged and promoted by National Boun|ties, as now in <HI>France;</HI> but there is no in|citing the Bulk of the People to Indu&s;try, in like Manner; that would be, as though the Public &s;hould grant a Bounty to it&s;elf. Nations certainly differ from Nations as Man differs from Man; Some are, by Na|ture, indu&s;trious and ingenious, &s;uch as <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> it is their Propen&s;ity, their Talent; while Others, like <HI>Ireland,</HI> are naturally lazy and li&s;tle&s;s, and therefore remain in well merited Indigence.</P>
<P>You have greatly mi&s;taken this Point indeed, my Lord. <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are indu&s;trious and ingenious, becau&s;e, whe|ther it were through good Hap or good Policy, they hit upon the only Method whereby Indu&s;try and Ingenuity could be duely promoted. Whereas <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> are totally ignorant of the &s;aid Method to this Day, though Both of them highly capable of having it put in Exe|cution.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
You &s;urpri&s;e me, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, a Method to make Men ingenious, a Method to make them indu&s;trious! how can that be?</P>
<P>Experience has proved it to be even &s;o, my Lord; for where a Method may be found for encouraging and promoting In|genuity and Indu&s;try, that Method will, infallibly, make People become both inge|nious and indu&s;trious. No Man will work, my Lord, without &s;ome Hire, or Wages, or Return for his Labour; neither will Any, who are in Want, refu&s;e to work, when a&s;&s;ured of a due Reward for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>When the good Hou&s;holder walked out to the Marketplace, and found Labourers loitering there, when it was now toward Evening, he a&s;ked them, <HI>why &s;tand ye here all the Day idle?</HI> And when they an&s;wered, <HI>becau&s;e no Man hath hired or given us Em|ployment,</HI> he took this for a &s;ufficient Apo|logy, he had Compa&s;&s;ion upon them, and he &s;upplied them with the divine&s;t of all Kinds of Charity, <HI>the Means of earning their own Bread.</HI></P>
<P>Now, throughout <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> no Per&s;on is in Want, becau&s;e All are hired, All employed, the Young and the Old,
<PB N="40" REF="39">the Lame and the Blind; and All find a ready Sale, without Anxiety or Lo&s;s of Time, without Travel or Delay, for the Products of their Indu&s;try. Throughout <HI>Great Britain,</HI> on the contrary, Nineteen in Twenty are in real Want; and in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> as I am told, Forty nine, in Fifty, are nearly in a State of Beggary, merely for want of being employed, for want of Encouragement to Labour.</P>
<P>Permit me, then, to explain to your Lord&s;hip, how &s;ome Men, and &s;ome Nati|ons, come to be encouraged to Indu&s;try, and Others to be di&s;couraged, or, in a Man|ner, prohibited from it.</P>
<P>Different Men are endowed with dif|ferent Talents and Powers, in&s;ufficient in many Re&s;pects, though &s;uperfluous in Others, to their own Occa&s;ions. Different Countries are al&s;o endowed with different Productions, &s;uperfluous in many Re&s;pects to the Natives, though nece&s;&s;ary or de&s;i|rable for the Well-being of Foreigners.</P>
<P>Now, the&s;e alternate Qualities, of De|ficience and Abundance, at once invite and impel all Men, and all Countries, to claim and to impart that reciprocal A&s;&s;i&s;tance which is denominated Commerce. Each gives what he can &s;pare, Each receives
<PB N="41" REF="40">what he wants; the Exchange is to the mutual Advantage of all Parties. And, could a Method be found out for encourag|ing Manufacturers to per&s;evere in their In|du&s;try, and improve in their Arts, by a ready Conveyance and Sale of all their Re|dundancies, neither Want nor Superfluity could find Place upon Earth.</P>
<P>All this is quite clear and &s;elf-evident, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> but how to procure this ready Sale is the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t allow that the Way to procure it would be to bring Barterers and Commuters, Buyers and Sellers! All who mutually want and mutually abound, together. For this is the End and Purpo&s;e of every Market upon Earth.</P>
<P>Now, in <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in all Continents or inland Countries, the &s;everal De&s;arts, Mountains, Mar&s;hes, and other Ob&s;tacles, with the Difficulty, Dan|ger, and Toil of Travel, and the great Expence of Land Carriage, have utterly precluded all Commerce and Communica|tion to any con&s;iderable Extent. In&s;omuch that it would be ea&s;ier and cheaper to con|vey a Commodity, of any Burden, to ei|ther of the <HI>Indies,</HI> than from many Parts of <HI>Great Britain</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> to Others, by Land.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">
While God appears to &s;eparate the &s;eve|ral Nations of the Earth from Each other, by the Intervention of Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, he hath actually and intimately united them thereby.</P>
<P>WATER &s;erves to the Art and Naviga|tion of Man, as Air &s;erves to the Wings of the feathered Species. It is the ea&s;y and &s;peedy Medium, the ready Conduit and Conveyance, whereby all Redundancies are carried, and all Wants &s;upplied. It makes Man, as it were, a Denizen of every Country on the Globe. It &s;hortens every Di&s;tance, and ties the remote&s;t Regions to|gether. It carries and communicates the Knowledge, the Virtues, Manufactures, and Arts of each Climate to All. It gives new Springs and Motives to Indu&s;try, Ac|tion, and Invention. It gives a general Im|portance to the meane&s;t Manufacturer. It gives to each Man an Intere&s;t in whatever is done upon Earth, the Productions of every Region, and the Tribute of every Nation.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are the only Countries upon Earth, who have con&s;ider|ably availed them&s;elves of this capital Be|nefit of Water-Carriage, or Water-Com|merce; and therefore they are, incompa|rably, the mo&s;t populous and mo&s;t pro&s;|perous of all Countries in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">
<HI>China,</HI> as your Lor&s;hip knows, extends from under the Tropic of <HI>Cancer</HI> to about thirteen hundred Miles <HI>North,</HI> and there|by contains within it&s;elf all the Variety of Climate, and Degrees of Heat and Cold, that are requi&s;ite for the &s;undry Producti|ons upon Earth. In&s;pired by &s;ome Fore|ca&s;t, or Sagacity, not imparted to the re&s;t of Mankind, they cut and quartered this va&s;t Continent, by as many navigable Ca|nals as an&s;wer to the Ducts and Veins in the human Body, for the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Life and Nouri&s;hment. The&s;e Canals &s;erve as Links or Chords to the grand Com|munity of the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> they bind Region to Region, Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and Man to Man, and hold the Whole as one Sy&s;tem or Family together. This great Kingdom is, thereby, become as one City, and the Canals as &s;o many Streets, through which Plenty is diffu&s;ed by Commerce to every Part. If any Art or u&s;eful Invention com|mences or receives Improvement in any Place, it is immediately conveyed to every Place for Imitation and Promotion. No Portion of this wide Continent lies wa&s;te or uncultivated, becau&s;e the Canals are as &s;o many Markets brought to every Man's Door, and, by the perpetual Demand of whatever is &s;aleable, incite the Natives to exert them&s;elves in providing all the Re|dundancies they po&s;&s;ibly can, that they may derive Wealth to them&s;elves by &s;upplying
<PB N="44" REF="43">the re&s;pective Wants of Others. Thus, throughout the expanded Dominion of <HI>China,</HI> nothing is wa&s;ted, nothing lo&s;t, nothing &s;uperfluous, nothing wanting. All are employed, active, indu&s;trious, ingenious, and thriving. Their Canals are intimately to them, what Seas are diffu&s;ively to the re&s;t of the Globe. They are thereby be|come, as a World within them&s;elves, &s;uffi|cient to their own Happine&s;s and Occa|&s;ions. They never change their Manners or Policy. They never enterpri&s;e War again&s;t Others. And <HI>China</HI> is affirmed at this Day, to contain one hundred and twenty Million of pro&s;pering Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> al&s;o, about a hundred and forty Years ago, followed the Example of the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> Their Country is now become as one great and extended Metropolis to the Univer&s;e; and through their Canals as through paved and &s;pacious High-Ways, the World re&s;orts with all its Wealth. So encouraged and &s;o incited, neither the Lame, nor the Blind, nor the Maimed, &s;it unemployed. Every Child is taught its Trade from the Moment it can apply its little Hands to a regular Motion, and they bring to the Parents va&s;t Sums, in lieu of an infinite Variety of Toys and Trifles that are di&s;per&s;ed among the Idle of the other Children of Men. For, Barterers, and Commuters, Buyers and Sellers, Manufac|turers
<PB N="45" REF="44">and Merchants, like <HI>Pyramus</HI> and <HI>Thi&s;be,</HI> want nothing but the removal of en|vious Ob&s;tacles, to meet and to multiply a &s;imilary Progeny.</P>
<P>From what has been premi&s;ed, my Lord, it is mo&s;t evident, That Indu&s;try is the Parent of the Wealth of this World. That no Man's Indu&s;try is &s;ufficient to his own Occa&s;ions. That the mutual A&s;&s;i&s;|tance denominated Commerce is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being of all People. That the reciprocal Advantage of this Com|merce con&s;i&s;ts in &s;upplying mutual Wants with mutual Redundancies. That this Commerce, however, cannot be carried on without a Medium for the Conveyance of &s;uch Supplies. That &s;uch a Medium, by Land, even where it is practicable, is tedi|ous, toil&s;ome, expen&s;ive, extremely di&s;|couraging, and cannot be pu&s;hed to any con&s;iderable Extent or Effect. That God, however, hath opened for the Purpo&s;e, an ea&s;y, &s;peedy and univer&s;al Medium of Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, Part of which he hath left unnavigable, that Man might fini&s;h, by Art, what Nature had prepared, and contribute in &s;ome Degree to his own Advantages. That accordingly <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> (and <HI>France</HI> of late) have pur&s;ued the Path &s;o divinely appointed, and that Power, Wealth and Pro&s;perity have flowed in upon them, in Proportion as they have
<PB N="46" REF="45">opened the Medium of Water-carriage for their Reception. And, that Cau&s;es which have produced their concomitant Effects, without Variation, from the earlie&s;t Ages to the pre&s;ent Period, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to produce the like Effects, through all Countries and Ages to the End of Time.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> exclaimed the Earl, you have pu&s;hed this Matter into mathematical Demon&s;tration. What a happy, what a glorious Pro&s;pect now opens to my View! How ea&s;ily, how &s;peedily, how profitably might this Method be put in Execution, throughout the Earth! There is no Deficiency of Rivers, or collateral Streams for the Purpo&s;e. The Sinking in|to the Earth would give Vent to new Springs, and extract Plenty of Water in all Places for an inland Navigation; and Half the Number of Hands, that peri&s;h through War and Want, might be peacefully and plentifully employed in accompli&s;hing this Weal of Mankind. Famine and Depreda|tion would then cea&s;e. Nation would no longer ri&s;e up again&s;t Nation, nor Man again&s;t Man. The Earth, by Culture, would &s;oon become capable of &s;u&s;taining tenfold the Number of its pre&s;ent Inhabi|tants. We &s;hould no more be tempted to pu&s;h Each Other from Exi&s;tence. We &s;hould find our&s;elves mutually intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving and multiplying the Lives of
<PB N="47" REF="46">All from who&s;e Labours we were to derive &s;uch Advantages. All would be Plenty, All Peace and Benevolence throughout the Globe. The Number of Inhabitants, in|&s;tead of being a Burden, would then be|come the Riches of every Climate. All Hands would be &s;et to Work, when thus a&s;&s;ured of a Purcha&s;er for every Effect of Labour. The Buzz of Wheels, Reels, and Looms; the Sound of Hammers, Files, and Forges; with the Shouts of Vintage, and the Songs of Harve&s;t, would be heared in all Lands! I am quite a&s;toni&s;hed that a Work, &s;o full of Benefit and Ble&s;&s;ing to the Univer&s;e of Man, is not already commen|ced, advanced, and compleated.</P>
<P>How comes this to pa&s;s, Mr. <HI>Meekly?</HI> Have You yet mentioned this Matter to Any of our Great Ones?</P>
<P>I have, my Lord, to Several. They con|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves convinced of the Utility of the Scheme; and, could Each of them be a&s;&s;ured of engro&s;&s;ing to him&s;elf the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Part of the Profits that would thereby accrue to the Public, the Work would in&s;tantly be begun, and would &s;hort|ly be perfected. For, &s;uch is the Nature of unregenerate Man, that he grudges to Others any Portion of tho&s;e Goods which he &s;o eagerly craves and grapples after for him&s;elf. He would hedge in the Air, and
<PB N="48" REF="47">make a Property of the Light. In Propor|tion as he &s;ees his Neighbours in compara|tive Want, he exults in the Accumulation of imaginary Wealth. But, &s;hould he deem them, in a Mea&s;ure, more pro&s;pe|rous than him&s;elf, he &s;ighs at his inmo&s;t Soul, and grows wretched and repining.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, cried the Earl, were I young, I would to Morrow Morning, at my own Co&s;t, &s;et about this great Work of national, or rather of univer&s;al Beneficence. But, my <HI>Harry</HI> here has Youth enough, with an Abundance of Benevolence al&s;o for the Purpo&s;e; and I recommend it to him as the greate&s;t of Charities, a Charity to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> a Charity to Mankind. What would you think, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> of my expending your whole Drawer of Gold upon this Bu&s;ine&s;s? great as it is, it would be but a &s;mall Matter toward the Value of purcha&s;ing Peace up|on Earth, and the Sons of Peace, upon Earth, will be likelie&s;t to be the Sons of Love in Heaven. So that we cannot lay out our Money to better Advantage, in any Purcha&s;e for the Benefit of the Brothers of our own Frailty.</P>
<P>Alas, my Love, rejoined Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> though you were Ma&s;ter of Half the Wealth of the People of <HI>England,</HI> and
<PB N="49" REF="48">were willing to employ the Whole for their Emolument in this Way, the People them|&s;elves would oppo&s;e you in every Step you &s;hould take. Some would be too proud to accept a Benefit from You. Others would tell you that no Man &s;hould dare to violate their Property with either Spade or Pick-Axe; and Others would indict you even for treading on their Grounds. No|thing le&s;s than the Act of the whole Le|gi&s;lature, to whom the People have com|mitted their confluent Powers, can avail for an Undertaking of &s;uch National Im|port.</P>
<P>Then, my dear Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> be plea&s;ed to let me have, in Writing, what you have already &s;et forth on this Head; and, if I live to come to the lower Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment, I will bend all my Powers to this capital Charity. And, if no other Oratory will avail for the Purpo&s;e, I will bribe the Members with a hundred thou&s;and Pounds, and corrupt them, if po&s;&s;ible, into one Act of Patrioti&s;m

<PB N="50" REF="49">interrupt You. Pray proceed in your Nar|rative.</P>
<P>On my Return to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> from my Tour through the Seven Provinces, I grew affected, one Evening, in a Manner I had never before experienced. I did not feel my&s;elf any way &s;ick or in pain, and yet I wi&s;hed to exchange my Sen&s;ations for any other Species of Malady. I was wholly pervaded by a gloomy De&s;pondence. I looked abroad for Comfort, but it was no where to be found, every Object gave Di&s;|gu&s;t to my di&s;contented Imagination. I &s;ecretly enquired of my Soul, if Riches, Honours, Dignities, if the Empire of the World would re&s;tore her to Joy? But She turned from them and &s;aid, All the&s;e Things are Strangers, and Aliens to my Peace. Alas, &s;aid I, tell me then where your Peace may be found? I know not, &s;he replied, but I feel that I am wretched.</P>
<P>For three Days I continued under this Oppre&s;&s;ion of Spirit. And on the third Night an increa&s;ing Horror, of deep and
<PB N="51" REF="50">heavy Darkne&s;s, fell upon me. All Hope died within me, and Mi&s;ery &s;eemed to open a Gulph of ever deepening De&s;truction in my Soul. I lay all the Night, bathed in Drops of unutterable Angui&s;h. I wi&s;hed and &s;truggled to ari&s;e and change my Si|tuation, but I felt that my Mind was its own Place and its own Hell, from whence there was no Removal, no po&s;&s;ible E&s;cape.</P>
<P>I now concluded that, &s;ome how, I mu&s;t have &s;inned beyond the Mea&s;ure of all Sin|ners, &s;ince my Damnation was deeper than that of any Other. I therefore turned to|ward God and wi&s;hed to repent; but, as I did not feel Conviction for the Sins of which I accu&s;ed my&s;elf, no Place for Re|pentance was found in my Soul.</P>
<P>Tremendous Author! I cried, I find that thou can'&s;t &s;ink and &s;lay at Plea&s;ure, but can'&s;t thou not al&s;o rai&s;e up and make alive? If all Things have their Exi&s;tence in thee, O God! is it not near and ea&s;y unto thee to impart to us &s;ome Sen&s;ation of thine own Exi&s;tence al&s;o? &s;ome Sen&s;a|tion of thine own Peace, the Sen&s;e that it is thou alone who can'&s;t be our Su&s;tainer? Save me, <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> &s;ave me from the Hell of mine own Nature! Save me, thou Son of <HI>David,</HI> O &s;ave me from My&s;elf!</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="51">
While I thus prayed in an Agony, my whole Frame was &s;uddenly overpower'd and &s;unk, as I &s;uppo&s;e, into a State of In|&s;en&s;ibility, till the following Day was far advanced. At length I perceived that I &s;till exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>I dreamed that I found my&s;elf in a deep and noy&s;ome Dungeon, without a &s;ingle Ray that might even &s;uffice to &s;hew me the Horrors of my Situation. I attempted to ri&s;e and grope about, but I perceived that I was tied and fa&s;tened down to Earth by a Number and Variety of Bands and Fet|ters.</P>
<P>At length a &s;udden Light appeared, and diffu&s;ed it&s;elf throughout the Darkne&s;s of my Man&s;ion. When, looking up, I ob|&s;erved that the Keeper of my Pri&s;on had entered, the Doors being yet locked. His Head, as I thought, was bound about with a Tiara, from whence the Glory aro&s;e that &s;hone around me. In the Coronet, in&s;tead of Gems, were in&s;erted a Number of Thorns, who&s;e Points &s;treamed with ince&s;&s;ant and in&s;ufferable Brightne&s;s. And on the golden Circlet was engraved, in all Languages, JESUS OF NAZARETH KING OF THE JEWS.</P>
<P>Immediately my Shackles loo&s;ened and fell away of them&s;elves, and I wi&s;hed to
<PB N="53" REF="52">ca&s;t my whole Exi&s;tence under the Feet of my Lord, but was &s;o overcome with Ec|&s;ta&s;y that I could not ri&s;e. When, look|ing upon me with a Smile of ineffable Graciou&s;ne&s;s, he approached and took me by the Hand, and, at the Contact, I &s;prung up a great Height in my Bed, and awoke to Sen&s;ations of inde&s;cribable Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>You are come then, my Lord, my Sal|vation, you are come, my Ma&s;ter! I cried; and I will cling in&s;eparably to you, never, O, never more will I &s;uffer you to depart. Ah, I have felt, &s;everely felt what it is to be without you. For, in your Ab&s;ence, though but for a Moment, lies the E&s;&s;ence of Hell and Mi&s;ery; but, in your Pre&s;ence, my Beloved, in your Pre&s;ence is Peace un|&s;peakable, and Joy for ever more!</P>
<P>From that Day, my Nature became, as it were, wholly inverted. All the Honours and worldly Re&s;pects, for which I for|merly ri&s;qued my Life, were now my Aver&s;ion, and I turned from carnal In|dulgence and Sen&s;uality with Loathing.</P>
<P>Nothing could now affront, nothing could now offend me. As I totally de&s;pi&s;ed my&s;elf, &s;o I wi&s;hed, after the Proce&s;s of my divine Ma&s;ter, to be de&s;pi&s;ed and re|jected of Men. This made all others, the very meane&s;t of human Creatures, re&s;pect|able
<PB N="54" REF="53">unto me. Even in Reprobates, me|thought, I di&s;cerned &s;ome unera&s;ed Traces of the Image and Super&s;cription of my God, and I bowed down before it.</P>
<P>If Any attempted to injure, or defraud me of my Property, I yielded it without Variance, and thereby I found my&s;elf cor|dially enriched.</P>
<P>I grew weary of my own Will and of my own Liberty, and I earne&s;tly prayed my Lord that he would rid me of them, and be, in&s;tead thereof, a controuling Prin|ciple within me, ever influencing and di|recting me according to his own Plea&s;ure. Turn me, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> Ma&s;ter! O turn me, I cri|ed, from all the evil Propen&s;ities of my own evil Nature, though thou &s;hou'd&s;t turn me, as thou did&s;t <HI>Sennacherib,</HI> with thy ruling Rein on my Neck, thy Bridle in my Mouth, and thy Hook in my No&s;e! Take my Heart and Affections captive, and into thine own divine Guidance! compel me into all the Ways and all the Works of thy Commandments; till thy Yoke &s;hall become ea&s;y and thy Burden light and de|light&s;ome; till I &s;hall move, as down a De&s;cent, wherever thy Goodne&s;s would guide me; till I &s;hall feelingly find and know that all thy Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all thy Paths the Paths of Peace!</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54">
This, my Lord, may look &s;omewhat like Boa&s;ting, but it boa&s;teth of Nought, excepting <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> crucified, or rather ari&s;en in me, whereby all worldly Matters are crucified unto me.</P>
<P>Within about a Fortnight after my Con|ver&s;ion, I received a Letter from a Friend in <HI>London,</HI> informing me that my old Un|cle had &s;ecretly married a young Creature, who was lately delivered of a Son. That he now openly acknowledged her for his Wife; and that this, as he feared, did not bode me any Good.</P>
<P>At another Time, the&s;e Tidings would have greatly alarmed me; but I was now equally re&s;igned and indifferent to all Events.</P>
<P>In a few Days after, as I was &s;tepping out of my Lodgings, I was arre&s;ted in the Name, and at the Suit of my Uncle, for &pound;.700, the preci&s;e Sum for which I had drawn upon him about nine Months be|fore. All the Con&s;equences of this Caption immediately occurred to me. I perceived that my Uncle intended to deprive me of my Patrimony, in Favour of his new Fa|mily; and, as I had no Means for oppo&s;ing his Machinations, &s;ave what lay in his own
<PB N="56" REF="55">Hands, I concluded that a Jail was to be my Portion for Life. Wherefore, I lifted up my Heart and &s;aid, within my&s;elf, to Pri&s;ons and to Death give me chearfully to follow thee, O thou who, in Death, art the Life and Re&s;urrection!</P>
<P>My Spirit had no &s;ooner uttered this &s;hort Ejaculation, than I felt &s;uch a Weight of Peace de&s;cending upon me, that my Heart leaped within me at the Pro&s;pect of Suffering, and I would not have exchanged my Pri&s;on for a Throne.</P>
<P>While I quietly walked with the Officers toward the Place of my Durance, they came to a great Tavern, where they en|tered and propo&s;ed to regale them&s;elves at my Expence.</P>
<P>Mean time, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant of great Eminence, happened to be, with his Lady, in the principal Room, and, hearing a Bu&s;|tle in the Hou&s;e, he enquired the Cau&s;e, and &s;ent for the chief Bailiff.</P>
<P>Soon after, I was conducted into their Pre&s;ence. They Both ro&s;e as I entered; and the Gentleman, approaching, took me familiarly by the Hand and &s;aid in <HI>Dutch,</HI> Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> I hear You are in Di&s;tre&s;s, and that is &s;ufficient to recommend you to my Services; but your Appearance exacts
<PB N="57" REF="56">Something more from my Inclinations. Pray let me know wherein, and how far it may be requi&s;ite for you to command me.</P>
<P>I muttered Somewhat, as I &s;uppo&s;e, in|articulately toward an An&s;wer. For I pro|te&s;t, my Lord, I was &s;o &s;truck, &s;o awed, &s;o confounded, by his Pre&s;ence, that I was lo&s;t, for the Time, to the Con&s;ideration of my own Affairs. Mean while he placed me at Table ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the heavenly Vi&s;ion of his Bride, and then went and re|&s;umed his Seat be&s;ide her; while I, gazing in Silence and utmo&s;t Wonder, recollected tho&s;e Lines of <HI>Milton</HI> where, &s;peaking of Adam and Eve, he calls them
<Q><L>"the lovelie&s;t Pair</L>
<L>"That ever &s;ince in Love's Embraces met;</L>
<L>"<HI>Adam,</HI> the goodlie&s;t Man of Men &s;ince born</L>
<L>"His Sons, the faire&s;t of her Daughters, <HI>Eve."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The Gentleman perceived my A&s;toni&s;h|ment, and graciou&s;ly &s;miling, again a&s;ked me what Sum was requi&s;ite to extricate me from my pre&s;ent Difficulty. Ah, Sir, &s;aid I, it is a Sum that far exceeds all human Bounty, and, indeed, I would not accept the Obligation from any Man, unle&s;s I were a&s;&s;ured of being &s;hortly in a Capacity to reimbur&s;e him, of which I &s;ee no Like|lihood, I think no Po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57">
Here I told him, in few Words, how my Father had left me an Infant at the Di&s;po&s;al of my Uncle, who had now put me under Arre&s;t for &pound;.700, which, &s;ome time &s;ince, he had freely remitted to me, as in my own Right.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid the Gentleman, your Uncle is a Villain, and means, by ca&s;ting You in|to Pri&s;on, in a &s;trange and di&s;tant Place, to deprive you of the Power of bringing him to Account. But he mu&s;t be detected, it is a Ju&s;tice which you owe to the Public, as well as your&s;elf. And, as the Amount of the pretended Debt is not &s;ufficient for that Purpo&s;e, here is an Order on the Bank in Town for double the Sum. For this you mu&s;t give me your Note of Hand. Be plea&s;ed to reimbur&s;e me when it is your Convenience. If that &s;hould never happen, be under no Concern; for I hold my&s;elf al|ready repaid with U&s;ury, in the Opportu|nity of &s;erving an injured and a worthy Man.</P>
<P>O Sir, I cried, I cannot, indeed I cannot, I will not accept it on any Account. I am patient, nay I am plea&s;ed with the Lot that is appointed me. Shall I, in an In&s;tant, break the Yoke and ca&s;t the Burden which my gracious Ma&s;ter, but this In&s;tant, has
<PB N="59" REF="58">laid upon me? No, Sir, I &s;ubmit my&s;elf to it with Thankfulne&s;s; I take his Cro&s;s to my Bo&s;om and pre&s;s it to my Heart.</P>
<P>O <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid he, you are a very mi&s;|deeming Chri&s;tian, if you think your&s;elf entitled either to a&s;&s;ume or retain your pro|per Cro&s;&s;es at will. There is too much of Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in &s;uch a Zeal, <HI>Meekly.</HI> Humility would rather bid the Will of our Ma&s;ter to be done; and he offers you Enfranchi&s;ement by my Hand. Do, my dear Sir, cried the Angel be&s;ide him, do, let me petition, let me per&s;uade you to ac|cept this little In&s;tance of our good Will to &s;o good a Creature. Though my Lord here has not been able to prevail, a Lady has &s;uperior Claims, and I mu&s;t not be refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Quite &s;unk, quite overwhelmed, I drop|ped involuntarily on my Knees before them. Ble&s;&s;ed Pair, I exclaimed, ble&s;&s;ed and beau|teous beyond Expre&s;&s;ion; if Angels are like You, what Happine&s;s mu&s;t be in Hea|ven! I could no more, my Words were choaked by my ri&s;ing Emotions.</P>
<P>My Benefactor then ro&s;e, and coming tenderly toward me, he took me warmly in his Arms. My <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;ays he, do not oppre&s;s me, I pray you, by this Exce&s;s of Acknowledgment; I am but a worthle&s;s
<PB N="60" REF="59">In&s;trument in the Hands of your Beloved; for from him, and him alone, is every good Gift, and even the Will of the Giver. O, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> added the Lady, her Eyes glittering through Water, we thank you, we cordially thank you, Mr. <HI>Meekly;</HI> you have occa&s;ioned us much Plea&s;ure this Day, I a&s;&s;ure you; and the Means of our Hap|pine&s;s &s;hould be delightful in our Eyes.</P>
<P>My Patron then rung a Bell, and order|ed his principal Gentleman into his Pre|&s;ence; when, putting the Order into his Hand, here, &s;ays he, take this, with the Bailiff, directly to the Bank; there pay him his Demand of &pound;.700 and Fees; and bring me a hundred Pounds in Ca&s;h, and the Remainder in Bills on <HI>London.</HI> Then, calling for Pen and Ink, he drew the fol|lowing &s;hort Note, <Q>I owe You fourteen hundred Pounds.</Q> To which I &s;igned <HI>Charles Meekly.</HI></P>
<P>On the Return of the Me&s;&s;enger, I was put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;h and Bills, and a Dinner of little Elegancies was &s;erv|ed up.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort Repa&s;t, the Decanters and Gla&s;&s;es being placed, and the Attendants di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, my two Patrons gave a loo&s;e to &s;ocial Joy, and invited me to be a Partaker
<PB N="61" REF="60">in their Fe&s;tivity. Never was I, nor ever &s;hall I again, be witne&s;s to &s;uch Flights of Fancy, &s;uch a &s;pontaneous Fluency of Heart-&s;pringing Glee! with what Plea&s;ure did Erudition ca&s;t off its formal Garb! how delightingly did Wi&s;dom a&s;&s;ume the Sem|blance and, at Times, the very Phra&s;e of Childhood! they laughed, they rallied me, them&s;elves, and the World. Their Mer|riment was as the Breaking forth and Exu|berance of overflowing Innocence and Vir|tue. Conceive to your&s;elf, my Lord, a large Room &s;urrounded with Benches, whereon are &s;eated the principal Philo&s;o|phers, Literati, Lawyers, State&s;men, chief Captains, and chief Conquerors in all Ages; then think you behold two &s;portively ob|&s;ervant Children in the Mid&s;t, looking and laughing at the In&s;ignificance of the &s;eve|ral Sages; taking off and holding up the Solemnity and Self-importance of each Pro|fe&s;&s;ion in Charicature; and &s;etting the whole World, with all its Wi&s;dom, its Toils, and boa&s;ted Acquirements, its So|licitudes, Applications, and Atchievements at nought.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, indeed, pretended, and only pretended, to defend the Sophi&s;ts, the Valiant, and the Renowned of his Sex; but he evidently exulted in his own Defeat; while the Lady, with a Drollery amazingly
<PB N="62" REF="61">valuble, ran through the Schools of Philo&s;o|phy, the Sy&s;tems of human Policy, and Hi&s;tories of Heroi&s;m, unpluming the Cre&s;t|ed, bringing the Lofty low, and depreciat|ing and reducing all Magnitude to Minia|ture. And all this She did with an Arch|ne&s;s of &s;uch plea&s;ant Meaning; with &s;uch Looks, Eyes, and Attitudes of bewitching Tran&s;ition, as would have infu&s;ed Fa&s;cina|tion into old Age and Ugline&s;s; what then mu&s;t it have done when accompanied by a Beauty that &s;carce ever was equalled, that could not be exceeded? Did the <HI>Sarah</HI> of the Patriarch <HI>Abraham</HI> re&s;emble her, I wonder not that Nations &s;hould have been enamoured of her at the Age of Four&s;core.</P>
<P>At length, the enraptured Hu&s;band; no longer able to contain, bent toward her with Looks of Soul-darting Delight, and, re&s;training his Arms that would have cru&s;h|ed her to his Bo&s;om, O, my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> he cried, You are too much, too pearly, too precious a Trea&s;ure for me! But, giving him a &s;weetly petulant Pat on the Cheek, away, you Rogue, &s;he &s;aid, I'll none of your Mockeries!</P>
<P>What can Expre&s;&s;ion add further to this divinely preeminent of human Creatures? whatever was her pre&s;ent Glance, A&s;pect, or Po&s;ture, you would have wi&s;hed to fix her in it, that you might gaze and admire
<PB N="63" REF="62">for ever. But, when &s;he varied the En|chantment of her Action and Attitude, you forgot the former Attractions; and She became as it were a Newne&s;s of ever ri&s;ing Delight!</P>
<P>Alas, how tran&s;ient, how momentary was the Bli&s;s I then enjoyed! A Chariot and &s;ix pied Hor&s;es drove up to the Door, attended by a Retinue of ten or twelve Men, All armed, gallantly mounted, and in rich Apparel.</P>
<P>My dear <HI>Meekly,</HI> mournfully &s;aid my Benefactor, I am &s;orry that we are de&s;tined to different Departments. Hodge to night at a Villa belonging to one of my Corre&s;|pondents, and To-morrow we &s;et out to vi&s;it &s;ome of the <HI>German</HI> Courts. Fare, fare you well, <HI>Meekly,</HI> for a &s;hort Sea&s;on at lea&s;t!</P>
<P>I would have ea&s;t my&s;elf at his Feet. It was an Emotion, a Propen&s;ity which I could not re&s;i&s;t; but he prevented me, by ki&s;&s;ing and ca&s;ting his Arms affectionately about me. The Lady then turned to me, and, with a Smile of Heart-captivating Graciou&s;ne&s;s, God be with You, God be with You, my good Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;he cried, perhaps we may meet ere long in your own <HI>England.</HI> I an&s;wered not, but bending on
<PB N="64" REF="63">one Knee, I caught her Hand, pre&s;&s;ed it fervently to my Lips, and permitted her to depart.</P>
<P>Alas, they did depart. I &s;aw them for the la&s;t Time. They mounted their Car|riage, and being &s;eated, they bent forward, and, bowing to me with a fix'd Regard, off they drove, and tore away with them, as I thought, the be&s;t Part of my Soul.</P>
<P>I followed them with &s;training Eyes: when out of &s;ight, methought I held them &s;till in view; and I ble&s;&s;ed and ki&s;&s;ed, in Imagination, the very Ground over which they went. At length I awoke from my Delirium, and with &s;low and heavy Steps turned back into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I had not yet, through Shame, &s;o much as enquired the Name of my Benefactor. I therefore called to my Ho&s;t, in order to inform my&s;elf of all that I could learn con|cerning him; as al&s;o to make out a Bill, for it had not been called for, and I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the Thought of di&s;charging a Reckoning that my Friends had forgotten. When I que&s;tioned my Ho&s;t on this Head, he put his Hands to his Sides and broke in|to a violent Fit of Laughter; no, no, Ma&s;|ter, &s;aid he, there's nothing for any One to pay in this Hou&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure You; Myn|heer never troubles him&s;elf about tho&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="64">Matters, his Major Domo pays all, ay, and for every Gue&s;t too that happens to be in the &s;ame Inn with his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Why pray, &s;aid I, is he a Lord? A Lord, quotha? not &s;o little as that comes to nei|ther; no Sir, he is a Prince, the very Prince of our Merchants, and our Mer|chants are Princes above all Lords. And pray how do they &s;tile or call him? He has many Names and Titles, when our Tra|ders &s;peak of him, they call him Mynheer <HI>Van Glunthong,</HI> but Others &s;tile him my Lord of Merchants, and Others my Lord the Brother-Man, and my Lord the Friend of the Poor.</P>
<P>The Remainder of my Story is very &s;hort, and &s;till more in&s;ignificant. I &s;oon &s;et out for <HI>England,</HI> in order to file a Bill again&s;t my Uncle, and compel him to di&s;co|ver what Patrimony my Father had left me. But God was plea&s;ed, in the mean Space, to cut off all Debate; his Wife and Child had died of an epidemic Di&s;temper, and he did not &s;urvive them above a Fort|night. He left me a penitential Letter, with a &s;mall Will enclo&s;ed, whereby I be|came entitled to three hundred a Year in right of my Father, and an additional four Hundred in right of my Uncle, with a Sum of near three thou&s;and Pounds in ready Money.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="65">
If I know my own Heart, the only Cau&s;e of rejoicing, that I felt on that Occa&s;ion, was that it put it in my Power to di&s;charge my Pecuniary Obligations to my late gene|rous Pre&s;erver. I immediately wrote and tran&s;mitted Bills to <HI>Holland</HI> for the Pur|po&s;e, but the Bills were returned, and I could hear no Tidings concerning the Re&s;i|dence of my Patron. I then put out his &pound;.1400 on the be&s;t Securities that I could procure. It is now clo&s;e upon five and thirty Years &s;ince I &s;aw him; and, in that Time, the Principal, with Intere&s;t upon Intere&s;t, yearly turned into Capital, has amounted to nearly five thou&s;and Pounds, one Penny of which I never touch, but hold the Whole as &s;acred.</P>
<P>Mean Time, it has co&s;t me Hundreds upon Hundreds in Corre&s;pondencies, Ad|verti&s;ements, and even in &s;pecial Me&s;&s;engers to &s;everal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> to di&s;cover where this Greate&s;t, this mo&s;t eminent of Men could have concealed him&s;elf; but alas, my Search proved as fruitle&s;s as that of the Mi&s;er in hunting after the Pearl of mighty Price!</P>
<P>During tho&s;e five and thirty Years, the Image of the Per&s;ons of tho&s;e my two gracious Patrons never left my Memory, were ever at my Heart. Ah, I would &s;ay
<PB N="67" REF="66">to my&s;elf, they are dead, they are dead; or rapt, perhaps, like <HI>Ebjah</HI> alive into Heaven; Fle&s;h and Blood, re&s;med as theirs, might ea&s;ily pa&s;s from its little Impurities, through the Fire of the Love of God, to the Place of its Bli&s;s. And again it was my daily and ardent Petition, that, if their Mortal was not yet &s;wallowed up of Im|mortality, I might once &s;et my Eyes upon them before I died.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> ended. &mdash; I thank you, my dear Friend, &s;aid the Earl, for your Hi&s;tory; it has entertained me mo&s;t plea&s;ingly, and I have al&s;o been highly edified by &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in it. But, with Re&s;pect to the Glimp&s;e that you had of your two wonderful Friends, I think it mu&s;t have been a Vi&s;ion, or merely a Matter of Imagination; for, I never &s;aw in Nature, nor read in Fiction of any thing comparable to the Excellencies that you have de&s;cribed in that exalted Pair. If it was a Vi&s;ion, my Lord, it mu&s;t have been one of ble&s;&s;ed Angels indeed; but I hope you will allow that the Benefits, which they conferred, were no way vi&s;io|nary. O, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Harry</HI> with a Sigh, the Picture, that you have drawn of that dear Lady, has almo&s;t given me a Di&s;ta&s;te to all the re&s;t of her Sex. Ah, might I meet hereafter &s;ome Daughter,
<PB N="68" REF="67">&s;ome De&s;cendent, &s;ome di&s;tant Likene&s;s of her, how happy &s;hould I think my&s;elf! May Heaven &s;ucceed your ominous Wi&s;h, my deare&s;t Child, cried <HI>Meekly!</HI> It is ju&s;t, perhaps prophetic that it &s;hould be &s;o. For, never did I &s;ee &s;o perfect a Re&s;emblance between any two Creatures, as between the Con&s;ort of that bewitching Woman and your&s;elf; it &s;truck me, the other Night, the Moment you enter'd the Room; and I thought that I beheld my very Benefactor newly ari&s;en, like a young <HI>Phoenix,</HI> from the A&s;hes of old Age.</P>
<P>Near a Fortnight more elap&s;ed, without any News or Notice from Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> or from the Me&s;&s;enger who was &s;ent di&s;patch for him. <HI>Harry</HI> daily advanced in the Favour and Familiarity of his Father. And Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> continued with them in a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Society.</P>
<P>On a fine Morning, as they were walk|ing together toward the Village, this is the fir&s;t Time, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid the Earl with a Sigh, that I have ventured to turn my Face this Way, &s;ince the Death of my Wife and the Interment of your dear Brother. O my Lord, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> I would gladly exchange my Lot in Life with the meane&s;t of yonder Cottagers, who earns his daily Bred by the Labour of his Hands, provided I might thereby re&s;tore
<PB N="69" REF="68">them Both to your Bo&s;om. Not &s;o, not &s;o, my Son, fervently replied the Earl, I would not lo&s;e my <HI>Harry,</HI> tho' I were thereby to re&s;u&s;citate All that are dead in <HI>England!</HI> I have no Cau&s;e, no Manner of Right to complain; I am &s;till happy, wonderfully happy, too happy in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Child!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, a great Shouting and Uproar was heard in the Village. The huge Ma&s;tiff, belonging to <HI>Peregrine Pelt</HI> the Tanner, had run mad, and came foaming up the Road, pur&s;ued by thirty of the Town&s;men, armed with Staves, Spits, and Pitchforks. The Dog ru&s;hed on at &s;uch a Rate, that there was no Po&s;&s;ibility for our Company to e&s;cape him; and <HI>Harry,</HI> ob&s;erving that he made directly toward his Father, threw him&s;elf full in his Way. In&s;tantly the envenomed Mon&s;ter &s;prung up and ca&s;t him&s;elf open Mouth upon our Hero; but <HI>Harry,</HI> with a wonderful Pre|&s;ence of Mind, having wrapped his left Arm in the Skirt of his Coat da&s;hed it into the frothing Jaws of the terrible Animal, when, giving a Trip, at the &s;ame Time, to his hinder Legs, he threw him flat on the Ground, and, &s;pringing up into the the Air, he de&s;cended upon him with all the Force of his Heels, and da&s;hed his Bowels to Pieces; whereupon the Creature
<PB N="70" REF="69">uttered a faint Howl, &s;prawled awhile, and expired.</P>
<P>The Earl and Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> &s;tood, yet a while, pale, a&s;toni&s;hed, and una&s;&s;ured; and my Lord, looking about in a Pannic, cried, where is the Dog, what's become of the mad Dog? In the mean time the Villagers came on in full Pur&s;uit, crying out, the mad Dog, the mad Dog, take Care of the mad Dog! But, when they All arrived, and beheld their huge Enemy looking formidable even in Death, never was Amazement equal to theirs. They &s;tared at the Earl, <HI>Meekly,</HI> and <HI>Harry,</HI> in Turns; and &s;eeing no Weapon in any of their Hands; God, cried Goodman <HI>Dem&s;|ter,</HI> God has been wonderfully gracious in your Deliverence, my Lord; for nothing le&s;s than a Thunderbolt could &s;o &s;uddenly have &s;tricken this Mon&s;ter dead. I prote&s;t, &s;aid the Earl, I was &s;o much alarmed that I know not how it happened; I remember nothing further than that my dear Child here thru&s;t him&s;elf between his Father and Danger. But I beheld, &s;aid <HI>Meekly,</HI> when, with one Stroke of his Arm, he da&s;hed the Creature to the Ground, and then in|&s;tantly cru&s;hed him to death with his Feet. Not I, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> mode&s;tly replied <HI>Harry,</HI> God gave me Strength, for the Sea&s;on, in Defence of my Father. But are you not bit, are you not hurt, my Child, cried
<PB N="71" REF="70">the Earl, coming up tremblingly to his Son? Not touched, indeed, my Lord. Glory for that in the Highe&s;t, exultingly cried the Earl!</P>
<P>I knew, exclaimed <HI>Tom Truck,</HI> with a Shout and Look of Triumph, I knew it could be no Other but my brave and noble young Ma&s;ter who did the Feat. On my Life, cried Farmer <HI>Fel&s;ter,</HI> he is able, with his naked Arm, like another young <HI>David,</HI> to &s;ave his Lambs from the Jaws of the Lion and the Paws of the Bear.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e Prai&s;es &s;erved only to put our Hero to Confu&s;ion, they went trickling, like Balm of <HI>Gilead,</HI> to the Heart of his Fa|ther. <HI>Pelt,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, let it be your Ta&s;k to flea and tan me the Hide of your own Dog. I will have his Skin &s;tuffed with Incen&s;e, and his Nails of &s;olid Gold; and he &s;hall hang up in my Hall, from Generation to Generation, to commemorate the Piety and Prowe&s;s of my Son! Mean while, my good Friends, I invite you All, with your Families, Kinsfolk, and Neighbours, to come and fea&s;t with me this Day. Sorrow hath endured her Night; but Joy cometh, with my Child, and ari&s;eth on us as a new Morning!</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, all the Towns-Folk and Neighbours, with their Wives and
<PB N="72" REF="71">Children, convened to the great Hou&s;e, having their Cattle and them&s;elves heavy laden with Faggots, for a magnificent Il|lumination. The whole Court was &s;pread with Tables, and the Tables with Victuals and Liquors; be&s;ide two Hog&s;heads of <HI>October</HI> that &s;tood apart.</P>
<P>The Earl, in the Joy for his own E&s;cape, and the recent Prowe&s;s of his young Hero, went forth with a chearful Countenance and graciou&s;ly welcomed all his Gue&s;ts; where|at, they wi&s;hed Health and long Life to his Lord&s;hip and their young Lord, and, giving a joint Huzza, &s;at down to their Banquet. From whence, after a Night far &s;pent in Carou&s;al, their great Fire being out, and their great Hog&s;heads exhau&s;ted, they peacefully helped Each-Other to their re&s;pective Homes; regretting, however, that they had not been honoured with the Pre&s;ence of their young Ma&s;ter among them. For <HI>Harry</HI> had be&s;ought his Father to di&s;pen&s;e with him, yet awhile, from partaking in any Party or Scene of Fe&s;tivi|ty, e&s;pecially when appointed in his own Honour; and Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> highly approved and applauded his Motion.</P>
<P>On the Eve of the following Day, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> rode abroad on a charitable Vi&s;it to a dying Man in the Neighbourhood; and
<PB N="73" REF="72">my Lord was fondly toying and patting the Cheek of his Darling, as they &s;tood at the Hall Door; when <HI>Harry</HI> &s;pied a mourn|ing Coach turning up the lower End of the great Avenue, and in&s;tantly cried out, there's my Uncle, my Lord, my Uncle, my deare&s;t Uncle! and off he &s;hot like Lightning. The Coach drove but &s;lowly, <HI>Harry</HI> was up with it in a Twinkling, and vaulting in at the Window, was, in the In&s;tant, in the Bo&s;om of his be&s;t Friend and Patron.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Earl had retired into the Hou&s;e in great Agitation. He feared and was jealous of the Manner in which his Brother would meet him; and this gave him equal Doubt and He&s;itation re&s;pecting the Manner in which he ought to receive his Brother. Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> on the other Hand, was not wholly without &s;ome &s;imilary Emotions; &s;o that, when <HI>Harry</HI> introduced his Uncle into the Par|lour, no two noble Per&s;onages could &s;alute Each other with a more di&s;tant Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Earl, however, on ca&s;ting a Glance upon the Face of his Brother, felt a Tide of returning Affection, and lifting up his Hands and Eyes, exclaimed, it is he, it is he! my <HI>Harry,</HI> my <HI>Harry Clinton!</HI> my dear, my long lo&s;t, my long &s;ought Bro|ther! then ha&s;tened forward, in a Gu&s;h of
<PB N="74" REF="73">Pa&s;&s;ion, and caught him in his eager Arms. When Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> alternately folding the Earl to his Bo&s;om, cried, I am content, O my God! give me now to depart in Peace, &s;ince at la&s;t, I find, and feel that I have indeed a Brother!</P>
<P>Our Hero, ob&s;erving the Violence of their Emotion, interpo&s;ed with a gentle Care, and &s;upporting them to Seats, placed them tenderly by each other.</P>
<P>For a while they Both &s;at &s;ilent, with a Handkerchief at their Eyes; till the Earl turned, and plaintively &s;aid, you don't for|give me, <HI>Harry Clinton;</HI> you never will, you never can forgive me, my Brother! Whereupon, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> caught up the Earl's Hand to his Lips, and, pre&s;&s;ing it with a fervent Re&s;pect, cried, my Brother and my Lord, my Brother and my Lord!</P>
<P>O then, &s;aid the Earl, you do forgive me, I find; but, never can I, never will I forgive my&s;elf. My Faults toward you, my noble&s;t Brother, for the&s;e many long Years have been ever before me; my Ne|glects, my Pride and In&s;olence, my con|temptuous Treatment of One, &s;o highly my Superior; of my <HI>Harry,</HI> the only Boa&s;t and Glory of our Hou&s;e!</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="74">
Mean while, our Hero &s;tood aloof with his Head averted, weeping and &s;obbing with evident Agitation. Till Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> cried, no more, my Brother, no more, I be&s;eech you! It is already too much; I cannot bear my pre&s;ent Exce&s;s of grateful Affection for you; it &s;truggles to ru&s;h forth, but Utterance is not given. Be&s;ide, we &s;hall break the Heart of our dear Child there; his Nature is too tender to &s;upport &s;uch a Scene as this.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then &s;milingly turned his Face, toward his Parents, all &s;hining through Tears, as the Sun in a Shower. And ad|vancing, and kneeling before them, as they &s;at; he took the Hands of Each, al|ternately, and pre&s;&s;ed them in Silence to his Lips.</P>
<P>In about an Hour after, while their Af|fections were &s;till at the highe&s;t, but their Spirits &s;omewhat compo&s;ed, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> returned. The Earl immediately ro&s;e, and advancing, took him by the Hand with a cordial Familiarity. Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;ays he, I &s;hall now have the Plea&s;ure of introducing you to that ine&s;timable Bro|ther of whom you have heard me &s;peak &s;o often; Brother, this is Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> my be&s;t and worthie&s;t Friend!</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75">
Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> ro&s;e and advanced; and <HI>Meekly</HI> approached with an aba&s;ed Reve|rence, not venturing to look up, but &s;aluted him, as he would have &s;aluted an Angel of Light!</P>
<P><HI>Meekly, Meekly,</HI> cried Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> I have &s;urely heard that Name before! Pray, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> were you ever abroad? have you travelled, Sir? were you ever in <HI>Holland,</HI> Mr. <HI>Meekly?</HI></P>
<P>Here, <HI>Meekly</HI> &s;tarted, as awaked by the Sound of a Voice, who&s;e recollected Tune|ings went thrilling to his Heart; and lifting up his Eyes, and beholding the Traces of Features, once &s;o lovely, and ever deeply endeared to his Memory; he &s;tarted, and &s;taggering back &s;ome Steps, he &s;unk down on a Chair behind him, al|mo&s;t in a fainting Fit.</P>
<P>The Earl, greatly alarmed, went up, and taking him by the Hand, what is the Matter, my Friend, &s;ays he? are you taken &s;uddenly ill, are you not well, my <HI>Meekly?</HI></P>
<P>O, my Lord &mdash; he pantingly cried &mdash; there he is &mdash; as &s;ure as I live &mdash; my Patron &mdash; my Benefactor &mdash; the wondrous Man that I told you of &mdash; there
<PB N="77" REF="76">he &s;tands, in his own precious Per&s;on be|fore us!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> then approached, and, tak|ing a Seat be&s;ide him, leaned toward him with a melting Complacence. Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid he, I expected ere this to have em|braced you in Heaven; but I rejoice to meet you even on Earth; for I have ever re|tained a very affectionate Impre&s;&s;ion of you; and I more e&s;pecially rejoice to meet you in the pre&s;ent Society.</P>
<P>But then &mdash; but then you come alone &mdash; you come alone, my Lord and Ma&s;|ter! &mdash; Alas, you wipe your Eye! &mdash; O then, it mu&s;t be &s;o! &mdash; And here he broke into a pa&s;&s;ionate Gu&s;h of Tears.</P>
<P>My Lord and our Hero, hereupon, re|collecting the engaging Circum&s;tances of a Character, on who&s;e De&s;cription they had been &s;o lately enamoured, could not refu&s;e their Tribute to the Memory of that admirable Lady, to who&s;e Per&s;on they now found them&s;elves endearingly attached by Affinity.</P>
<P>At length Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t Degree for the Di&s;tre&s;s in which he &s;aw the forlorn <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;weetly turned from his own Affliction to the Con&s;oling of that
<PB N="78" REF="77">Friend whom he found &s;o deeply afflicted for him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;ays he, let us not weep for the Living, but rather for the Dead! for tho&s;e who are yet in the Vale of Mor|tality. Shall we mourn the Condition of Angels, &s;hall we lament that a Weight of Glory is fallen on tho&s;e whom we loved? No, let us rather rejoice in the Pro&s;pect of being &s;peedily Partakers!</P>
<P>When Supper was over, <HI>Harry</HI> laid hold of the fir&s;t Interval of Conver&s;e, to en|quire after his Friends in Town, more e&s;pecially Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> his <HI>Arabella,</HI> and their little <HI>Dicky.</HI> They are come, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> to &s;udden and great Affluence. Old <HI>Clement</HI> is thoroughly reconciled to his Son, and is doatingly fond of <HI>Arabella</HI> and her Child. I am glad of it with all my Heart, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> clapping his Hands; but pray, how did this Matter come about, Sir? By an Event, my Dear, in which the Arm of Providence was &s;ignally vi&s;i|ble. But, before I &s;ay how it came to pa&s;s, you ought to give our Company a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of this worthy Family, they will then become intere&s;ted in their Suc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="78">
<HI>Harry,</HI> willingly and gracefully, per|formed the Ta&s;k enjoined him; and then his Uncle proceeded.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Day after you le&s;t me, a Man of a genteel Appearance, but pale and bleeding, was carried, &s;tretched on a Door, by &s;ome of our charitable Town&s;men, and brought to my Hou&s;e. I was then a|broad with <HI>Clement</HI> on a Vi&s;it to your old Friend <HI>Vindex;</HI> but the Stranger was in|&s;tantly admitted; and, while &s;ome of the Servants rode off for a Surgeon, others tenderly undre&s;&s;ed and put him into a warmed Bed.</P>
<P>Soon, after I had returned and was in|formed of what had pa&s;&s;ed, the Surgeon arrived, and, putting five Guineas in his Hand, I de&s;ired him to attend his Patient and bring me Word of his E&s;tate. In Half an Hour he came forth and, &s;haking his Head, &s;aid, our Patient, Sir, will not do. He is wounded in the Groin with a Pi&s;tol Bullet. The Ball has got within the Abdomen, my In&s;truments will not reach it, and, if it has entered the Vi&s;cera, he will die of Convul&s;ions in le&s;s than three Hours. I have accordingly told the Gen|tleman what I thought of him, and advi&s;ed him immediately to &s;ettle his worldly Affairs. He tells me his Name is <HI>Saint-Belial,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="79">and he reque&s;ted me, as &s;oon as I reached <HI>London,</HI> to &s;end Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> to him, who lives over again&s;t the blue Po&s;ts on the Strand.</P>
<P>The Name of <HI>Clement</HI> made me curious to know who the Party was, and, entering his Chamber, I took a Chair and &s;at down &s;oftly by the Side of his Bed. But, the Moment that I ca&s;t my Eye on his Vi&s;age, I &s;hrunk inward at the Shock; for all the Malignity and Horrors of Hell were jointly legible on his Countenance.</P>
<P>Humanity, however, compelled me to addre&s;s him. I am &s;orry to hear, Sir, &s;aid I, that you are not for this World, but I tru&s;t that your Hope looks forward to a better Home. I have no Hope, &s;aid he, &s;ave &s;uch as my Faith has been, that, &s;ince I mu&s;t die, I &s;hall die wholly.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, I was &s;o &s;tunned and di&s;concert|ed by the Words and Looks of the Man, that I found no An&s;wer, and he proceeded.</P>
<P>As I have no further Concern with this World, I have &s;ent for an old Gentleman with whom I had &s;ome Connections, and re&s;olve to do an Act of Ju&s;tice before I die, the only One that ever I did during my Life-time. For, your Charity, and that of your People, has half frightened me in|to
<PB N="81" REF="80">a Notion, that there may be &s;omething of that, which is called Goodne&s;s, upon Earth; and then how fearful, how tremen|dous mu&s;t my Situation be! Wherefore, as old <HI>Clement</HI> may not arrive in Sea&s;on, I will, with your Permi&s;&s;ion, inform you of &s;uch Things as concern him. For, as I have nothing to hope, through all Eternity, nei|ther have I any thing to fear on this Side of it.</P>
<P>My Father's Name was <HI>Belcher Saint-Belial.</HI> He was an under Retainer to the Law, and raked up a little Fortune by &s;ide|long Practices; &s;o that he grew ambitious of preferring me, his only Child, to the Bar, and, in that View, &s;ent me to School, and from School to <HI>Oxford</HI> College. But, I ought to have began my Hi&s;tory ear|lier.</P>
<P>If there are Devils, I &s;urely had One be|fore I &s;aw the Light, and was filled with the evil Spirit from my Mother's Womb; in&s;omuch that my Nur&s;e died of a Cancer in her Brea&s;t occa&s;ioned by the envenomed Bites I gave her Nipple, with my toothle&s;s Gums, while &s;he &s;uckled me.</P>
<P>While an Infant, I took a heart-felt Plea&s;ure in di&s;membering Flies and impale|ing Worms alive upon Pins; and, when
<PB N="82" REF="81">at School, I was the Promoter of all Parties for worrying and torturing Cats and Dogs to death. But my principal Amu&s;ement lay in catching and fleaing Frogs, in &s;eeing them &s;pring about in the Rage of their Pains, and &s;o leaving them to peri&s;h in un|utterable Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>As I grew in Stature, I grew al&s;o in the Strength of my Malignity. Evil became my Good. My Enjoyments lay in the Lo&s;s, Damage, and Detriment of Others. I conceived a Kind of envious Hate again&s;t Tho&s;e who had done me a Benefit. I re|quited open Friend&s;hip with hidden Male|volence; and I cannot remember that ever I felt a Sen&s;e of any thing that goes by the Name of Gratitude, Humanity or Virtue.</P>
<P>I u&s;ually carried about me a walking Stick or Cane, in the hollow Part of which an Iron Spike was contained, which I could cau&s;e to &s;pring forth with a Shake of my Arm, and again return to its Ca&s;e, at Plea&s;ure. With this, as I &s;trolled the Fields, which I often did for the Purpo&s;e, I &s;tabbed the Cattle of the Neighbours in the Belly or Fundament, and chuckled to &s;ee them leap, and kick, and plunge about in their Agonies. In &s;hort, I drew to my|&s;elf a Kind of Comfort from a Compari&s;on with the Mi&s;eries that I inflicted on other Creatures; and, had the Elements been at
<PB N="83" REF="82">my Controul, nothing but Pe&s;t and Hurri|cane, Di&s;temper and lingering Death &s;hould have ari&s;en and prevailed throughout the State of Nature.</P>
<P>At the College I got acquainted with one <HI>Clement,</HI> a gentle tempered but weak Lad, of whom I made a Property. And I pre|vailed upon him to turn away &s;everal of his Servants, under Colour of their having &s;tollen the Ca&s;h, Books, and other Effects, of which I had &s;ecretly plunder'd him.</P>
<P>At length I had private Intelligence that my Father had been pilloried for Forgery and other double handed Dealings; that he had died of the Brui&s;es which he re|ceived on the Execution of his Sentence; and that his Effects had been &s;eized by a Variety of Claimants. Wereupon, with|out taking any Notice of my Father or Family, I made my &s;horte&s;t way to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> with All that I could borrow or lay a light Hand upon among my Acquain|tance.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing I did, at the City, was to wait upon old <HI>Clement,</HI> the Father of my Friend, with a forged Draught upon him for a hundred Pounds; on the Sight of which, he &s;o fretted, and exclaimed, and walked about in &s;uch Perturbation, that
<PB N="84" REF="83">I greatly feared I had over&s;hot my Mark. At length, however, he laid me down the Money, but catching up a Book, &s;wore that it was the la&s;t Penny his Son &s;hould re|ceive from him for &s;ix Months to come.</P>
<P>He then began to que&s;tion me touching the Character of the young Gentleman, and, under Colour of prai&s;ing him for Ar|ticles to which I perceived the old Man had an Aver&s;ion, I exa&s;perated him to &s;uch a Degree, that he again &s;wore he would hold no further Corre&s;pondence with him, until he &s;hould be fully a&s;&s;ured of his Re|formation.</P>
<P>Having thus effectually cut off all Com|merce between my Friend and his Father, I ca&s;t a&s;ide my Fears of being &s;uddenly brought to Account for my late Acqui&s;iti|on. I was even &s;o daring as to take Lodg|ings the very next Door, where I got in League with a young Woman of a mo&s;t &s;educing Face and Per&s;on, but who&s;e Pro|fligacy of Manners was, artfully, covered by the mo&s;t artle&s;s Appearance of &s;hame|faced Innocence that ever graced the feigned Character of any Actre&s;s, on any Stage.</P>
<P>She did not attempt, however, to im|po&s;e upon me, for kindred Minds, like Ours, in&s;tantly &s;aw into Each Other; and
<PB N="85" REF="84">we &s;oon concerted a Plan for her marrying Goodman <HI>Clement,</HI> and dividing the Spoils of the old Mi&s;er between us.</P>
<P>This we ea&s;ily brought about, and never was Man &s;o happy, in being &s;o impo&s;ed upon, while I &s;hared with him in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Pur&s;e and his Bride.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as I had promi&s;ed to procure him Intelligence concerning his Son, I produced &s;everal forged Letters from pre|tended Corre&s;pondents in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> con|taining &s;uch Accounts of the Galantries and other Extravagancies of young <HI>Clement,</HI> as wholly alienated his Father's Affections from him, and he &s;ent him a final Note, whereby he di&s;carded him from his Fortune for ever.</P>
<P>About two Years thus pa&s;&s;ed, in the full Enjoyment of All that could glut Fle&s;h and Blood; though, in order to ingratiate my|&s;elf with the old Man, I appeared to him the mo&s;t frugal and ab&s;temious of Mankind. But, one Night, while Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> and I &s;at together, indulging our&s;elves in the Hope that the good Man had been knock|ed on the Head, or had fallen dead of an Apoplexy; He was brought to us in a Chair, pale and wounded, and told us that he &s;hould have been certainly murdered, had he not, by the mo&s;t wonderful Provi|dence,
<PB N="86" REF="85">met with his Son, who bravely knocked down the Robber and happily de|livered him; and that he had given him what Ca&s;h he had about him, with a Note for &pound;. 500, on the Bank.</P>
<P>All in a Pannic, and thunder&s;truck as I was by this News, I yet pretended to con|gratulate him on the Return of his Son to Duty, but advi&s;ed him to Bed directly for the Recovery of his Health and Spirits.</P>
<P>The Remainder of the Night, I walked about, agonizing, and racking my Brain for &s;ome Expedient to divert the in&s;tant Ruin that impended, when a &s;udden Thought &s;tarted, or was rather infu&s;ed into me, and, at Dawn of Day, I went to an Agent, who had done &s;everal Jobbs for me, of no very laudable Tendency.</P>
<P>When I had given him his Le&s;&s;on, and put twenty Guineas into his Hand, he ha&s;|tily went and de&s;ired to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> on Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Con&s;equence, when, fall|ing on his Knees, he confe&s;&s;ed, with ap|pearing Penitence, that he was the Per&s;on who had wounded him the foregoing Night; that he did not intend to hurt him &s;o much, but that young Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> had hired him for the Purpo&s;e, and lay in wait hard by, in order that he might appear to come in to his Re&s;cue.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86">
This Tale was &s;o fea&s;ible, that the old Man &s;wallowed it, as a greedy Fi&s;h &s;wallows the Bait that, at the &s;ame time, conveys the Barb into his Bowels. He thereupon had me called to him in a Hurry, told me what he had di&s;covered, and gave me an Order to &s;top Payment of the &pound;.500, with a ha&s;ty Note to be left at the Bank for his Son.</P>
<P>On the Way, I recollected an Adverti&s;e|ment in the public Papers that offered a large Reward for the Caption of one <HI>Ara|bella Clement,</HI> who had been guilty of the Murder of the late Lord <HI>Stivers;</HI> and it in|&s;tantly occurred to me that She was proba|bly the Wife of my quondam Friend and Patron. Wherefore, as &s;oon as I had di&s;|patched my Bu&s;ine&s;s at the Bank, I ran and collected a Number of Con&s;tables, and waited with them aloof, till I &s;aw the Ob|ject, whom I dreaded and dete&s;ted above Plague and Poi&s;on, enter and return di&s;|contented from the Counting-Hou&s;e. We then dogged him at a Di&s;tance till we &s;aw him &s;afe lodged and, following &s;oftly up Stairs, we demanded a Woman who &s;tood before us for our Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Clement</HI> then, all enraged, exert|ed him&s;elf with wonderful Action and In|trepidity. With one Stroke of a Poker, he
<PB N="88" REF="87">tore off my right Ear and cleft my Shoul|der to the Bone; then drove us All down Stairs, though &s;everal Shot were fired at him.</P>
<P>What happened to him afterward I knew only from Report, for I lay ill of my Wounds for &s;everal Months together, and on my Recovery, could learn no Tidings concerning him.</P>
<P>In the mean Space, my continual Fears of his Appearance made my Life extremely mi&s;erable. My Paramour and I had often Thoughts and Con&s;ultations touching the Expediency of making away with the old Gentleman; but it occurred to us that young <HI>Clement</HI> might &s;till be alive and, on the Death of his Father, might bring us to a &s;evere Account for his Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>At length, about &s;ix Weeks ago, as I returned from tran&s;acting an Affair at <HI>St. Albans,</HI> I met, and in&s;tantly recognized my old Enemy, walking with a young Gen|tleman, about a Mile above this Town. Immediately I &s;topped, and, pulling my Hat over my Eyes, pray Gentlemen, &s;aid I, am I on the right Road to <HI>London?</HI> for I have travelled far, and fear I may have gone a&s;tray. You are on the direct Road, &s;aid the Lad, but if you choo&s;e to &s;top &s;hort, you
<PB N="89" REF="88">are heartily welcome to a Lodging with us for the Night. Why, Gentlemen, &s;aid I, do you live in yonder Town? We do, &s;aid <HI>Clement.</HI> In that An&s;wer I had all the In|telligence I de&s;ired, and away I &s;purred.</P>
<P>From that Time, &s;carce a Day pa&s;&s;ed wherein I did not take an Airing on the &s;ame Road, &s;till expecting and panting to meet my Adver&s;ary. I rode armed with one Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tols before me, and Another in my Pockets; and I determined, though I &s;hould meet <HI>Clement</HI> in the Mid&s;t of a hun|dred Men, to &s;hoot him directly through the Head, and tru&s;t to the Speed of my Hor&s;e for my E&s;cape. But, this Day, as I returned near the farther End of the Town, a white Goat, pur&s;ued by a Dog, ru&s;hed &s;uddenly through a Hedge, whereupon my Hor&s;e plunged, and one of the Pi&s;tols that was ready cocked in my Wa&s;tcoat Poc|ket went off, and reduced me to the Condi|tion in which you behold me.</P>
<P>His la&s;t Words were &s;carce intelligible. He was &s;eized with Convul&s;ions and lay &s;peechle&s;s near two Hours. At length old <HI>Clement</HI> arrived; his Servants helped him out of his Coach; I met him in the Hall, and led him into the Parlour.</P>
<P>There, being both &s;eated, I &s;uccinctly gave him the Heads of <HI>Saint Belial</HI>'s Hi&s;|tory.
<PB N="90" REF="89">When, looking earne&s;tly at me, you appear, Sir, &s;aid he, to be much of the Gentleman, but, if you were an Angel, I would credit nothing again&s;t the Hone&s;ty of that good Young Man; and lea&s;t of all to the Prejudice of the dear young Innocent that I have married.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was &s;omewhat piqued at this &s;udden Rebuff; but, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Ten|dency that I had to Re&s;entment, I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, you had come Time enough to be pre&s;ent at the unhappy Man's Confe&s;&s;ion, but it may yet plea&s;e God to open your Eyes to your own Wrongs before he ex|pires.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, I conducted him to the Room where the Wretch lay, to all Appearance, in&s;en&s;ible. I then recollected an approved Elixir that I had in my Clo&s;et, and &s;ending for it, I infu&s;ed a Tea-&s;poon full, Drop by Drop, into his Mouth.</P>
<P>In a Quarter of an Hour he came perfect|ly to his Sen&s;es, and, turning his languid Eyes toward the old Man, You are come then, &s;aid he, to hear my dying Words. &mdash; I forged the Note for which you gave me a hundred Pounds &mdash; I forged all the Letters that you received to your Son's Prejudice &mdash; I was the Father of the Child which the Strumpet, with whom
<PB N="91" REF="90">you live, brought into the World &mdash; She is not your Wife &mdash; She is Wife to <HI>Caleb Cable</HI> the Boat&s;wain, who lives by the Monument. &mdash; He has got Hundreds of your Money for keeping Coun&s;el &mdash; It was, in truth, your Son who re&s;cued you from the Hands of the Robber &mdash; I forged the Tale, and bribed the Man who deceived you in that Matter &mdash; Often, as you lay in Bed, <HI>Moll Cable</HI> has urged me to di&s;patch you before Morning &mdash; Had I murdered your Son, as I long &s;ince intended, you &s;hould not have &s;urvived him four and twenty Hours. &mdash;</P>
<P>Here, turning his eager and gha&s;tly Vi&s;age upon me, O Sir, &s;aid he, is there, is there, for certain, a Judgment to come? Alas! I an&s;wered, Death, Judgment, Hea|ven, and Hell, are the four capital Things of which the Univer&s;e affords the highe&s;t and deepe&s;t A&s;&s;urance. O, then, he cried, I am going, down! down! down!</P>
<P>This he &s;poke with all the vi&s;ible Hor|rors and De&s;peration, conceivable in <HI>Judas,</HI> when ju&s;t about fixing the Rope to his Neck; and, lap&s;ing into his la&s;t Agonies, he &s;oon after expired.</P>
<P>All pale and a&s;toni&s;hed, the old Gentle|man &s;at &s;ilent and panting; and, &s;eeing he
<PB N="92" REF="91">was about to faint, I ordered &s;ome Drops and Water, with a Bottle of Wine, while I &s;upported him from falling.</P>
<P>When he was &s;omewhat re&s;tored, and had recovered his Speech, he laid hold on my Hand and &s;aid, I beg your Pardon, Sir, I would do it, if I were able, upon my Knees. But, who could have thought this?&mdash;I wi&s;h that I had indeed been murdered&mdash;I would that I had died, before I was thus undeceived in the only Objects of my Love.&mdash;Alas, Sir, I have now no Relation, no Kindred, no Friend except your&s;elf upon Earth. All Others are equally Plunderers and Murderers in my Eyes.&mdash;The&s;e Words were inter|rupted by a Flood of Tears.</P>
<P>Having con&s;oled him in the kinde&s;t Man|ner I could, Word was brought that Din|ner was &s;erved, and I led him, partly by Con&s;traint, to the Table; but whi&s;pered private Orders that <HI>Arabella</HI> and her <HI>Dickey</HI> &s;hould not appear, for <HI>Clement</HI> &s;taid to dine with his Friend <HI>Vindex.</HI></P>
<P>After Dinner and three Gla&s;&s;es, which was all I could force upon him, I remon|&s;trated the Expediency of his immediate Return, to &s;ecure his Effects; le&s;t all &s;hould be &s;pirited away upon any Intimati|on of the pre&s;ent Accident. Ah, Sir, &s;aid
<PB N="93" REF="92">he, I &s;hall &s;carce, I fear, be able to bear the Sight of a Place in which I &s;o long thought my&s;elf &s;o very happy; but if you will be &s;o gracious as to accompany me I will venture. I will, &s;aid I, on Condition, that you engage to return and &s;leep here this Night.</P>
<P>Early in the Afternoon we arrived at his Hou&s;e, in my Coach, attended by his two Servants and Four of mine, well arm|ed. As we entered the Parlour, his &s;up|po&s;ed Wife ro&s;e in an Alarm that &s;he evi|dently endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s. What is the Matter, Lovee? &s;aid &s;he, advancing; for what did <HI>Saint Belial</HI> &s;end to you? it became him much better to have attended on You, methinks. I fear my Lovee is &s;adly tired. But, pray, what did he want with you? To tell me, an&s;wered old <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> that he was a dying Man, that I was a Dupe and a Cuckold, and that you were a Strumpet.</P>
<P>O fye, Lovee, &s;aid &s;he, tho&s;e are very naughty Names; but you cannot be in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Step, &s;aid he, and enquire of <HI>Caleb Cable</HI> the Boat&s;wain; tell him, at the &s;ame time, that I cannot afford to maintain his Wife any longer, and that he has &s;een the very la&s;t of his hu&s;h Money. Ah, <HI>Polly, Polly,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="93">he continued, meltingly, all this I could almo&s;t away with; but Murder is a fright|ful Thing; who could think that my <HI>Polly</HI> would murder her old Man?</P>
<P>O then, &s;he cried, I &s;ee that the Villain has betray'd me. I &s;ee that I'm undone. My Youth and Beauty ca&s;t away, my Arts and Time &s;pent in vain! Why, you doat|ing, driveling Wretch, your Fortune was little enough to compen&s;ate the Pains I took in di&s;gui&s;ing my Aver&s;ion to you. But, you &s;hall not live to triumph in my Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he &s;prung forward and, gra&s;ping his Neck in both her Hands, he in&s;tantly grew black in the Face, his Eyes rolled, his Jaws expanded, and he mu&s;t have expired on the Spot. But I &s;tepped ha&s;tily to her and, &s;eizing both her Wri&s;ts, I gave them a &s;udden Wrench, whereupon &s;he loo&s;ed her Hold, &s;houting out that her Arms were broke, and throwing her&s;elf, groaning, into a Chair, &s;he called for in|&s;tant Perdition on me, the crazy Dotard, her&s;elf, and all the World.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the old Gentleman had &s;unk panting to the Floor. But, rai&s;|ing him gently, I placed him on a large Sofa, where he began to re&s;pire with Free|dom.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="94">
I then &s;ent for a Sergeant at Mace and his Attendants, and giving our Heroine, with a Mittimus into his Hands, I de&s;ired him to provide her with a decent Room and &s;uitable Accommodations, and not to admit any Company, except her Servant, till further Orders. Ay, away with her, away with her, at any Rate! exclaimed the old Man, &s;he has the Looks of a very <HI>Gor|gon,</HI> and every Hair of her Head is turned into a frightful Serpent.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, I called her principal Maid and, putting a few Pieces into her Hand, I de&s;ired her to follow her Mi&s;tre&s;s and to &s;erve her with Care and Tenderne&s;s; and further to intimate to her that, when &s;he gave any Proofs of Repen|tance and Reformation, &s;he &s;hould yet be humanely and generou&s;ly provided for.</P>
<P>Having thus far &s;ettled Matters, I gave Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Andrew,</HI> with a male Dome&s;tic in whom the old Man con|fided, to remain and take care of the Hou&s;e and Effects; and, taking the Keys of the Cabinets with us, we &s;et off on our return to <HI>Ham&s;tead.</HI></P>
<P>On the Way, Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> grew deeply dejected, and &s;ighing &s;aid, O Sir, how
<PB N="96" REF="95">&s;trong, how very &s;trongly is the De&s;ire of Society impre&s;&s;ed on the human Heart; when, even in the Ab&s;ence of Robbers and Murderers, I feel a Want and Di&s;con&s;olati|on that I cannot expre&s;s. I have now no Relation, no Friend but Your&s;elf, no Kin|dred or Connection with any Other upon Earth. To You, indeed, I owe my Life, and all el&s;e that I am worth; and, if you will not cha&s;e me from You, if you will allow me to remain with You, You &s;hall be all the World to me, the Heir and &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>But, have You not a Son? I cannot think I have, &s;aid he; it is now above eight Years &s;ince I &s;et Eyes on my dear <HI>Hammel,</HI> the precious Pearl whom, in my Dotage, I madly ca&s;t away. But, were he &s;till living, after what is pa&s;t, I could never more have the Courage to look him in the Face. A cruel and a fal&s;e Pelican have I proved to my Little One; in&s;tead of fo&s;tering him with my Vitals, I have with|held and torn from him even the common Means of Life.</P>
<P>Do you know None of your Name, &s;aid I, who may claim your Sub&s;tance under Co|lour of being of your Blood? Not Any, Sir; my Father was a Foreigner, and I never heard of any Other of the Name in this Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="96">
There is One of your Name, &s;aid I, who lives in our Town. But then, he is in flowing Circum&s;tances, quite above the De&s;ire of encrea&s;ing his Fortune by ba&s;e or low Means. He is my mo&s;t intimate Friend, a very accompli&s;hed Gentleman, and has one of the fine&s;t Women to Wife, and two of the lovelie&s;t Children that I have &s;een. If you plea&s;e, I will invite and introduce them to You, to Night, or to Morrow.</P>
<P>On our Arrival, I left old <HI>Clement</HI> a while in the Parlour, while I &s;tepped to give pri|vate Directions re&s;pecting the Conduct of your Tutor, <HI>Harry,</HI> and the Interview which I propo&s;ed between him and his Father.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I as I returned, I have taken the Liberty to invite your Name&s;akes to &s;up with You. They are a very amiable Family, and I hope that their Company and Acquaintance will prove a Matter of Con&s;olation, perhaps a Ble&s;&s;ing to You. Ah, he cried, my Claims are of a very dif|ferent Nature; I have no Right to Ble&s;&s;ings or Con&s;olations of any Kind.</P>
<P>Some time before Supper, a Rapping was heard, and <HI>Arabella</HI> enter'd, leading in a little Daughter of about four Years
<PB N="98" REF="97">old, and followed by her Son, <HI>Dickey,</HI> All elegantly dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, this is a Name&s;ake of Yours, my worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> pray let me have the Plea&s;ure of intro|ducing You to each Other.</P>
<P>When they were both &s;eated, the old Gentleman took out his Per&s;pective, and, peering at her for &s;ome Time, ah, he cried, what lovely Faces there are in the World, but All have not proved lovely throughout, like You, Madam.</P>
<P>He then called <HI>Dickey</HI> to him, and tak|ing him by both Hands, and bringing him forward between his Knees; what is your Name, my Dear, &s;ays he? <HI>Richard Clement,</HI> Sir, &s;o plea&s;e You. I would it were <HI>Bar|tholomew,</HI> replied the old Gentleman; but Names &s;ignify nothing, You are a &s;weet little Fellow, and perhaps may be &s;omething the better for my Death. I would not wi&s;h your Death, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Dickey,</HI> for All that I could get by You. O, how very hea|venly, exclaimed the old Man, how hea|venly is the Simplicity and Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of Infants!</P>
<P>He next reque&s;ted <HI>Arabella</HI> to &s;pare her little Daughter to him, for a Minute; and &s;he accordingly took and led her to him:
<PB N="99" REF="98">When, fondly care&s;&s;ing her, and &s;eating her on his Knee, Could you find in your Heart, &s;ays he, to love &s;uch an ugly old Thing as I am? Yes, me could, &s;ays &s;he, and me has got &s;ome Comforts for you in my Pocket. Whereupon &s;he produced a little Paper and, unfolding it, pre&s;ented him with &s;ome candied Seeds and Almonds. O, my God, cried the old Man, what a Heaven I &s;hould yet enjoy upon Earth, could I but purcha&s;e the Society of the&s;e dear Infants!&mdash;I heard him, with a moi&s;tening Eye, and rejoiced in the ripen|ing Fruits of my little Project.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, &s;ays I, what is become of our good Friend your Hu&s;band, are we not to have the Happine&s;s of his Company to Night? Sir, &s;ays &s;he, he was engaged on indi&s;pen&s;able Bu&s;ine&s;s at the Time, but will certainly attend you before Supper.</P>
<P>She had &s;carce &s;poke when a &s;econd Rap|ping was heard, and in came our <HI>Hammel,</HI> not in gay but co&s;tly Apparel, as I had ap|pointed.</P>
<P>On introducing the Son, to his venera|ble Father, they re&s;pectfully &s;aluted Each other as utter Strangers. For, our pre|&s;ent <HI>Hammel</HI> was more different from the meagre and threadbare <HI>Hammel</HI> that his
<PB N="100" REF="99">Father had la&s;t &s;een, then <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s fat Kine could be from his lean Ones.</P>
<P>During Supper, and after, I purpo&s;ely threw out occa&s;ional Topics, and gave &s;e|veral Opens, wherein I knew that <HI>Hammel</HI> could &s;hine; and he accordingly made U&s;e of them with great Spirit and Advantage.</P>
<P>His Father gazed at him with a re&s;pect|ful Admiration, and at length exclaimed, You are an Ornament, an Honor, Sir, to your Name, to your Lineage, and the Country wherein you were born. But pray of what Family? Alas, Sir, you add Stings to the Recollection of my Faults this Day: I once had a Son, a Son who, in an humble Degree, might now have re&s;embled your|&s;elf; but my Unkindne&s;s mu&s;t, long &s;ince, have broken his gentle Heart. My Child &s;aved me from Murderers, and I in Re|turn was the Murderer of my Child. O, <HI>Hammel,</HI> my <HI>Hammel,</HI> my Son, my Son <HI>Hammel,</HI> would to God I had died be|fore I wronged thee! Would God I had died for thee, O <HI>Hammel,</HI> my Son, my Son!</P>
<P>His la&s;t Words were broken and nearly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by a Gu&s;h of Tears; when the tender hearted <HI>Hammel</HI> turned an Eye upon me, and cried, O, Sir, we have gone too far! &mdash; Then, ha&s;tily advancing, he threw
<PB N="101" REF="100">him&s;elf at the Knees of his Father. I am here, Sir, he cried, your <HI>Hammel,</HI> your own <HI>Hammel,</HI> in all Duty and Affection, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and pro&s;trate before you.</P>
<P>You my <HI>Hammel,</HI> are you my <HI>Hammel,</HI> a&s;ked the old Man? Ah, had you but his fami&s;hed Face and his tattered Garment, I would take you to my Arms, to my Heart, into my Vitals.</P>
<P>O, my Father, cried <HI>Hammy,</HI> look not &s;o &s;trange and wild upon me! I am indeed your Child, once the Darling of your Heart, whom you fo&s;tered &s;o tenderly, and nur|tured at School and College; the true Son of your true Wife, look upon me, my Father! You often told me that I was her Picture; do you not &s;ee the very Fea|tures of my dear Mother in my Face?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, I think I do.&mdash;But then I have been mightily impo&s;ed upon of late. I would you were leaner and wor&s;e clad, my Child! however, if you come in the Name of my Son, I al&s;o will kneel down and crave his Pardon and your Pardon?</P>
<P>Here the old Gentleman &s;unk down up|on his Knees, and poor <HI>Hammel,</HI> &s;tarting up at the &s;ame in&s;tant, cried aloud, Alas! Sir, he is be&s;ide him&s;elf, and I too &s;hall go di&s;tracted!</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="102-204" TYPE="pages">
<PB N="102" REF="101">
<P>I then was grieved at Heart for the Stra|tagem I had made U&s;e of, to connect this worthy Family the more endearingly toge|ther. And coming &s;oothingly to him, and rai&s;ing him in my Arms, I replaced him in his Seat, and &s;aid, believe me, tru&s;t to me, my dear Mr. <HI>Clement;</HI> this is your true Child, your only Child, your true <HI>Hammel!</HI> He has lived with me many Years, I can prove him to be your's by a thou&s;and Wit|ne&s;&s;es, by tho&s;e who can witne&s;s what he has &s;uffered, on account of being your Son.</P>
<P>Well, well, well, &s;aid he, whi&s;peringly, it does not &s;ignify much, for I have ano|ther One coming, my <HI>Polly</HI> is now in the ninth Week of her Reckoning.&mdash;Ay, but, that <HI>Saint Belial,</HI> who knows but the Child may be an Imp of his Begetting?&mdash;A cur&s;ed Couple they are, I'm &s;ure; &s;he a Succubus, and he the Devil him&s;elf incarnate&mdash;I hope they didn't hear me&mdash;&s;hut the Door!&mdash;O, there they are!&mdash;Save me, &s;ave me!&mdash;they come upon me!&mdash;My Throat, they gripe my Throat!&mdash;My Breath, my Breath!&mdash;O&mdash;h&mdash;</P>
<P>Here he &s;wooned. But, on taking a little Blood, he came to him&s;elf. So I or|dered
<PB N="103" REF="102">all to be kept quiet about him; and, getting him to Bed, he &s;wallowed a &s;opo|rific Draught, &s;lept &s;oundly till Morning, and awoke in his perfect Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>I then went to bid him Good-morrow, and took a Chair by his Bed&s;ide.&mdash;That was a mighty agreeable Family, &s;aid he, who &s;upped with you la&s;t Night, Sir. The very worthie&s;t, I replied, that I know upon Earth.&mdash;You called them <HI>Clement,</HI> I think.&mdash;That is their Name, Sir.&mdash;Pray, did they go Home?&mdash;No, they are here &s;till; at Times, we make but one Family and one Hou&s;ehold.</P>
<P>While I &s;poke, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee <HI>Clement</HI> enter, dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;habby Clothes in which we fir&s;t found him, <HI>Harry;</HI> and the old Gentleman, turning his Head to the Door, &s;tarted up in his Bed and cried, if I am a living Man, that is &s;urely my <HI>Hammel,</HI> my very Son <HI>Hammel.</HI></P>
<P>On hearing this, poor <HI>Clement</HI> leaped ha&s;tily forward and, falling by the Bed, &s;eized One of his Father's Hands, repeat|edly ki&s;&s;ed it, and wept upon it. You are re&s;tored to me then, he cried, my Father, my Father! God be prai&s;ed, God be prai&s;|ed! You are re&s;tored to me entire, I tru&s;t, with all that paternal and melting Fond|ne&s;s which was once the Ble&s;&s;ing and the
<PB N="104" REF="103">Trea&s;ure that I prized above the World. No, <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;aid the old Man, I will not deceive you, I cannot love you as I once loved you, becau&s;e you never can forgive me. If you could forgive me, <HI>Hammy,</HI> I would love you with a double Love, a Love pa&s;&s;ing the Love of Fathers.</P>
<P>O, my Father, exclaimed <HI>Hammel,</HI> this one happy Moment of Reconciliation am|ply cancels all Offences, and outweighs all Sufferings. Permit me then, my dear|e&s;t Father, to introduce Tho&s;e to you who have an equal Right to your Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, off he went, and brought in <HI>Arabella,</HI> with her attending Children, and all the Four kneeled down by the Side of the old Man.</P>
<P>O, my God, he cried out, you are too bountiful, too gracious, you oppre&s;s, you cru&s;h me to nothing with this exceeding Weight of your Benefits! I was a withered and a bla&s;ted Branch, and you have cau&s;ed me, like <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Rod to Bud and Blo&s;&s;om anew, and to bear the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Fruits, I tru&s;t, to your Glory!</P>
<P>When Breakfa&s;t was laid, and the old Gentleman dre&s;&s;ed, I &s;ent up for him, and when we were &s;eated, <HI>Clement</HI> entered with
<PB N="105" REF="104">his Family, All elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, as on the preceding Night. <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;aid I, how came you by that Di&s;gui&s;e which you put on this Morning? You looked &s;o unlike your|&s;elf you almo&s;t frightened me.&mdash;Don't you remember that Dre&s;s, Sir?&mdash;How &s;hould I remember what I never &s;aw be|fore?&mdash;O, you did &s;ee them before, Sir; tho&s;e were the Weeds I wore, when you &s;aved me and Mine from fami&s;hing; and I have ever &s;ince pre&s;erved, and &s;hall ever pre&s;erve them, as the precious Memo|rial of my Obligations to you. What, ex|claimed the old Gentleman, my Life, and your Life! has he &s;aved your Life al&s;o, my Son? Yes, Sir, cried the grateful Crea|ture, All who are alive here live only by&mdash;Here, while I put one Hand to the Mouth of my Friend, his venerable Father &s;eized hold on the Other, and, bending one Knee, he pre&s;&s;ed it to his Lips, in a Silence that pa&s;&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Utterance.</P>
<P>But pray, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;aid I, to turn a&s;ide the Subject, what do you propo&s;e to do with Mrs. <HI>Cable?</HI> You know that, in Ca&s;e of Penitence, I promi&s;ed to have her taken Care of. To be &s;ure, Sir, &s;aid he, I will make good all your Engagements, and I will further do whatever &s;he de&s;ires, on Condition of her re&s;iding in a different Country, or rather in a different Kingdom; for I would not, for the World, that &s;he
<PB N="106" REF="105">&s;hould come within the Reach of me, by fifty Leagues at lea&s;t; unle&s;s you were al|ways to be with me for a Safeguard.</P>
<P>I laughed, and, immediately, Mrs. <HI>Cable</HI>'s Maid entered all in a Heat, with a fright|ened and imploring Countenance. So my good Girl, &s;aid I, how is your Mi&s;tre&s;s, to Day? Ah Sir! &s;he cried, I have but a very &s;ad Account to give you of my Commi&s;&s;ion. My Mi&s;tre&s;s is dead, and I doubt that I, my&s;elf, have been ignorantly her Mur|derer.</P>
<P>Soon, after &s;he was &s;hewn to her Apart|ment, <HI>Hetty,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I find my&s;elf grow|ing very &s;ick, pray &s;tep and bring me the little Bottle of Cordial, that you will find &s;tanding in &s;uch a Corner of my Clo&s;et. I did as I was ordered and, returning in all Ha&s;te, I pre&s;ented her with the Bottle. When, looking mournfully at it, and giv|ing a heavy Sigh, Ay, &s;he cried, this is the right Cordial, this will do the Bu&s;ine&s;s; then calling for a Wine Gla&s;s, &s;he filled and drank it off.</P>
<P>In a little while after, &s;he complained of being drow&s;y, whereupon I undre&s;&s;ed and helped her to Bed, and lighting a Can|dle, I &s;at down to watch be&s;ide her. For a Time, &s;he appeared to &s;leep quite &s;ound and ea&s;y, but again, began to moan and
<PB N="107" REF="106">to&s;s the Clothes. In a while after, how|ever, &s;he &s;eemed quite compo&s;ed. But, toward the Dead of Night, not hearing her breathe, I held up the Candle, and &s;aw that her fine Face was livid and gha&s;tly, and her Skin all di&s;coloured.</P>
<P>I then thought that I, my&s;elf, &s;hould have dropped dead on the Spot. I gave a great Shriek, and, I believe, continued &s;hrieking till the Keeper and a Servant Maid came in. So Sir, if your Honour is plea&s;ed to think that the Blame of this Matter belongs to me, I am come to deliver my|&s;elf up to Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>No, my Girl, &s;aid I, you are not at all &s;u&s;pected. I don't perceive any Intere&s;t that you could po&s;&s;ibly have in this melan|choly Event. No, Sir, &s;aid old <HI>Clement,</HI> I can an&s;wer for her Innocence; &s;he is but a late Comer; &s;he was particularly tender of me, and, I dare &s;ay, knew nothing of the ill De&s;igns of her Mi&s;tre&s;s. And &s;o, <HI>Hetty,</HI> I will recommend you to a better Mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Hetty,</HI> an Angel of a Mi&s;tre&s;s, even to my own deare&s;t Daughter, who &s;its blu&s;hing before you there.</P>
<P>That Night, after the Inque&s;t of the Coroners, Mrs. <HI>Cable</HI> was &s;ecretly buried in the Fields, and my Servants interred her Confederate on the high Road; for I did
<PB N="108" REF="107">not choo&s;e to have the &s;acred Ceremony of our Church profaned over a Reprobate who rejected the Hope of a ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The Day before I &s;et forward, our kind-hearted <HI>Clement</HI> earne&s;tly petitioned to accompany me, and urged his Impatience to embrace You, my <HI>Harry;</HI> but this I peremptorily refu&s;ed, as I was &s;en&s;ible that his own Affairs demanded his Pre&s;ence. So I came away, alone, yet attended by the Tears and good Wi&s;hes of the happie&s;t Fa|mily that is, I think, within his Maje&s;ty's Dominions.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Brother, &s;aid the Earl, the latter Part of your Story is exceedingly plea&s;ing, and yet &s;carce makes Amends for the Horrors that preceded. My Fle&s;h, as well as my Spirit, &s;till &s;hudders at the Cha|racter of that accur&s;ed <HI>Belial.</HI> I did not think that &s;uch a Malevolence and Malig|nity of Di&s;po&s;ition could be generated in the Bottom of Hell it&s;elf.</P>
<P>And yet, my Lord, I am per&s;uaded, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> that could it plea&s;e God, at this In&s;tant, to withdraw from me the Influence of his holy and happy Spirit, I &s;hould become altogether as evil as <HI>Belia</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="108">
I cannot think &s;o, my Brother, replied the Earl, You would &s;till continue a Rati|onal and free Creature. There is certainly a Di&s;tinction in the Nature of Things; there is the Beautiful and Deformed, the Amiable and Dete&s;table; your Judgment would approve the One and reject the Other; and your Freedom of Agency would act conformable to your Election.</P>
<P>Ah, my Lord, cried Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> what Things, what Beauty, what Amiablene&s;s, what Freedom is this that you &s;peak of? Have you found out another Univer&s;e, or another Deity be&s;ide Him in whom our Life &s;ub&s;i&s;ts? Are there any Things in Nature, &s;ave the Things of our God? Or what Beauty or Amiablene&s;s can they po&s;&s;i|bly exhibit, &s;ave what they derive from him; &s;ave &s;ome Quality or Impregnation, &s;ome Manife&s;tation or Impre&s;&s;ion of his own Beauty or Amiablene&s;s?</P>
<P>To make this Matter clear, let us go &s;omewhat deeper, quite back, if you plea&s;e, my Lord, to the very Birth of Things.</P>
<P>Throughout Nature, we find that God can impart to his Creatures a Being, an Identity, a Fire of Life, an Intelligence or Sagacity, a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, a Force or Acti|on, a Will, and a Freedom, di&s;tinct from
<PB N="110" REF="109">him&s;elf, and di&s;tinct from each Other; and this is the utmo&s;t Extent of Creaturely Na|ture, whether re&s;pecting the Powers that are in Hell or in Heaven, whether re&s;pect|ing the highe&s;t Seraphim that are in Bli&s;s or in Perdition.</P>
<P>Now, all the&s;e Powers or high Preroga|tives, although di&s;tinct from God, are in|finitely far from being independent of him, for he will not, he cannot depart from his Supremacy, nor that Univer&s;ality of E&s;|&s;ence, by and in whom alone all E&s;&s;ences &s;ub&s;i&s;t. He can, indeed, impart the fore|mentioned Powers to any limited Degree that he plea&s;es; but then, in their highe&s;t Degree of Fire, Life, or Sagacity, Force, Action, or Freedom, you will perceive, on the &s;lighte&s;t Reflection, that there is no|thing of the <HI>Beautiful</HI> or <HI>Amiable,</HI> that You &s;poke of; but that they are equally ap|plicable, and may be equally exerci&s;ed to evil, or good Purpo&s;es, according to the Nature or Di&s;po&s;ition of the Agent.</P>
<P>Your Pardon, for one Minute, my noble Brother! I have already &s;pecified the many great and wonderful Powers that God can impart to his Creatures, di&s;tinctly, though not independently, from Him&s;elf. But there is one Power, one Quality which God cannot make Creaturely; which, with all his Omnipotence, he cannot po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="111" REF="110">impart, in any Kind of Di&s;tinction or Sepa|rability from him&s;elf; and this Quality is called GOODNESS.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Lord, in order to convince You of this mo&s;t capital and mo&s;t important of all Truths, a Truth upon which, Time, Eternity, and the Univer&s;e all turn, as on their Axis; it may be nece&s;|&s;ary to enquire what GOODNESS is.</P>
<P>It will be an&s;wered, that GOODNESS is various and infinite in its Kinds and Degrees. It is &s;o indeed, for it is, at once, ONE and MANY. It &s;prings forth from our God, as the living Fountain in Paradi&s;e, that thence divided it into Rivers and numberle&s;s Streams, to water and repleni&s;h the whole Earth. All tho&s;e Streams, however, were but &s;o many Parts or Portions of the one variou&s;ly ble&s;&s;ing Fountain, and that Foun|tain is LOVE, it is the LOVE of Others, my Lord.</P>
<P>There is no Species of allowed or con|ceivable Virtue, that is not reducible under the Standard of this, their great Leader, and all generating Parent, called LOVE. GOOD WILL is the eternal Ble&s;&s;er of All to whom it is beneficent, and al&s;o ge|nerates its own Ble&s;&s;ing in the very Act of its Love.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="111">
Here lies the great and impa&s;&s;able Gulph, between God and his Productions, between the Creature and the Creator. The Will of God is an Eternal FIRE OF LOVE to|ward his Creatures, and goes forth in Ble&s;&s;ings upon them as wide and univer&s;al as his own Exi&s;tence. But the Will of the Creature is confined and limited like its E&s;&s;ence. While it is di&s;tinct, or uninform|ed of the Will of God, it cannot po&s;&s;ibly act beyond or out of it&s;elf; it cannot po&s;|&s;ibly feel for any Thing except it&s;elf; it cannot wi&s;h any Welfare except its own Welfare, and this it endeavours to com|pa&s;s by the Exertion of all its Powers. In|deed, we may as well &s;uppo&s;e that a crude Rock, at the Extremity of either Pole, while compa&s;&s;ed by perpetual Darkne&s;s and compacted by perpetual Fro&s;t, &s;hould yet kindle it&s;elf, and beam forth in Light and Warmth upon All around; as that any creaturely Will &s;hould, of its own Powers, go forth in Affection or Kindne&s;s upon Others.</P>
<P>From this di&s;tinct, &s;elfi&s;h, and craving Will of the Creature &s;prings every po&s;&s;ible Evil, whether natural or moral. From the Preference of its own Identity to that of Others, ari&s;eth Pride. From the Eager|ne&s;s of its gra&s;ping at all Advantages to it&s;elf, ari&s;eth the Envy of any imaginary
<PB N="113" REF="112">Advantage to Another. Pride, Covetou&s;|ne&s;s, and Envy beget Hatred, Wrath and Contention, with every Species and Degree of Malevolence and Malignity; and the Di&s;appointment of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions produces Rancour and Mi&s;ery; and, Altogether, they con&s;titute the whole Nature and King|dom of Hell it&s;elf in the Soul.</P>
<P>But, when God is plea&s;ed to inform the Will of the Creature with any Mea&s;ure of his own benign and benevolent Will, he &s;teals it &s;weetly forth in Affection to Others. He &s;peaks Peace to the Storm of rending Pa&s;&s;ions; and a new and delightful Dawn|ing ari&s;es on the Spirit. And thus, on the grand and final Con&s;ummation, when every Will &s;hall be &s;ubdued to the WILL OF GOOD TO ALL, our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> will take in Hand the re&s;igned Chordage of our Hearts, he will tune them, as &s;o many In&s;truments, to the Song of his own Sentiments, and will touch them with the Finger of his own divine Feelings. Then &s;hall the Wi&s;dom, the Might, and the Goodne&s;s of our God become the Wi&s;dom, Might, and Good|ne&s;s of all his intelligent Creatures. The Happine&s;s of Each &s;hall multiply and over|flow, in the Wi&s;hes and Participation of the Happine&s;s of All. The Univer&s;e &s;hall begin to &s;ound with the Song of Congratu|lation, and all Voices &s;hall break forth in an eternal Hallelujah, of Prai&s;e tran&s;cending
<PB N="114" REF="113">Prai&s;e, and Glory tran&s;cending Glory! to God and the Lamb!</P>
<P>Ha&s;ten, ha&s;ten that ble&s;&s;ed Period, great God, we be&s;eech thee! exclaimed the Earl. But, tell me, my heavenly Bro|ther, for it is &s;urely in Heaven that you hold your Conver&s;ation, and from whence you derive all your Knowledge and Lights; tell me then, is there no Di&s;tinction, no Preference, in Matter of Goodne&s;s, be|tween Creature and Creature, between Man and Man? For this &s;eems to be the Con&s;equence of what You have &s;et forth very nearly, I acknowledge, to mathe|matical Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>Your Que&s;tion, my dear Lord, is very deep, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and &s;till leads to greater Depths than I would choo&s;e to di&s;|clo&s;e before our <HI>Harry,</HI> yet awhile. I will however attempt, in few and &s;imple Words, to give you &s;ome Satisfaction on this mo&s;t intere&s;ting Article.</P>
<P>There are two great and capital Errors, under which the World of Man hath la|boured, and &s;till continues to labour ever &s;ince the Creation. The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is, that of a&s;cribing and imputing, to Our&s;elves, every Emotion and Inclination, toward Virtue or Goodne&s;s, that we &s;eel within us: The <HI>Se|cond</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="114">is, that, as free Agents, we are ena|bled to elect and reject, merely by the Act of an own Will independent of any Im|pul&s;e or Bias whatever.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn your Lord&s;hip that every creaturely Will, independent of the Will of its God, can be no other than an eager Craving after its own Happine&s;s, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be affected in Behalf of an|other Creature, who is wholly di&s;tinct from it and wholly an Alien to it. Where|fore, every creaturely Will, in &s;uch a &s;e|parate and adver&s;e State, is altogether as an <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> who&s;e Hand is again&s;t every One, and every One's Hand again&s;t him.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, I have &s;hewn You that God (the &s;ole Fountain of all Being and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s) can, in his Nature and Di&s;|po&s;ition, be nothing but LOVE; and that, even in loving Him&s;elf, he mu&s;t love his own Productions, the Realizing of his own Ideas, and the Works of his own Power. What, indeed, &s;hould hinder our God from being wholly a God of Love? Was there any thing before him, was there any thing coaeval with him to controul or op|po&s;e him? Had he any thing to envy, had he any thing to excite his Anger, except his own Conceptions, and The&s;e he was at Liberty to bring, or not to bring into Exi&s;|tence
<PB N="116" REF="115">or Perceptibility, even at his own Plea&s;ure. What then &s;hould affect him with the &s;lighte&s;t Tincture of Malignity? Could he add to his own Happine&s;s by rou&s;ing the hateful Pa&s;&s;ions within his own ble&s;&s;ed Bo&s;om? We may more rationally &s;uppo&s;e that the Sun, in his di&s;tant Zenith of burning Superiority, &s;hould have his Light impaired by the Squirt of a School|boy, than that the Deity &s;hould be affect|ed, with any Touch of Malevolence, by any Creature, or by all the Creatures that his Omnipotence can produce.</P>
<P>Purblind Rea&s;on, here, will &s;ay; even the Goodne&s;s of God him&s;elf, in the hu|man Heart, will &s;ay, if our God is all LOVE, if he is a Will to all Rectitude and Happi|ne&s;s in his Creatures, why did he &s;uffer any Evil to begin in Nature or Creature? Could Evil have ari&s;en contrary to the Will of Omnipotence, if Omnipotence had willed that it &s;hould not ari&s;e?</P>
<P>Ah, my Friends, no Evil ever did nor ever can approach the Will of God; neither can he will or affect any Species of Evil in Nature or Creature, but he can allow a tem|porary Evil in the Creature, as a Travail toward its Birth into the more eminent Degree of that Goodne&s;s and Happine&s;s which God affects. God cannot affect or take Delight in the Sufferings of the
<PB N="117" REF="116">mo&s;t abandoned Reprobate that ever bla&s;|phemed his Name; but, he can will that the Sinner &s;hould be reclaimed, to Happi|ne&s;s, even by Suffering, when there are no other Means, in Nature, whereby he may be reclaimed.</P>
<P>Could Creatures, without the Expe|rience of any Lap&s;e or Evil, have been made duely &s;en&s;ible of the Darkne&s;s and Dependance of their creaturely Nature, and of the Di&s;tance and Di&s;tinction be|tween them&s;elves and their God; could they have known the Nature and Extent of his Attributes, with the Infinity of his Love; could they have known the dread|ful Con&s;equences of falling off from him, without &s;eeing any Example, or expe|riencing any Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Fall; could they have, otherwi&s;e, felt and found that every Act of creaturely Will, and every Attempt at creaturely Power, was a For&s;aking of that eternal Wi&s;dom and Strength in which they &s;tood; could all in|telligent Creatures have been continued in that Lowline&s;s, that Re&s;ignation, that Gratitude of burning Affection which the &s;lain. Will of the mortified Sinner feels, when called up into the Grace and Enjoy|ment of his God; could tho&s;e endearing Relations have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Creation, which have &s;ince newly ari&s;en, between God and his lap&s;ed Creatures, wholly &s;ub&s;equent
<PB N="118" REF="117">thereto; tho&s;e Relations, I &s;ay, of Redemp|tion, of Regeneration, of a Power of Con|ver&s;ion that extracts Good out of Evil, of a Love that no Apo&s;tacy can quench, that no Offences can conquer; if the&s;e eternal Benefits could have been introduced, without their Ground or Foundation in the Admi&s;&s;ion of Evil, no Lap&s;e or Falling off would ever have been.</P>
<P>To make this Matter &s;till clearer, if po&s;&s;ible &mdash; In the dark and the bound|le&s;s Mirror, called Nature, God beheld and contemplated, from all Eternity, the Love|line&s;s of his own Light and the Beauty of his own Ideas, even tho&s;e Ideas to which he had determined to impart Perceptibility, or a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and Feeling of an Owne&s;s of Exi&s;tence, in Him. He al&s;o contem|plated, therein, the whole Infinity of Po&s;&s;i|bilities, all Cau&s;es with their Con&s;equences in the remote&s;t Relation, all Events that ever &s;hould or ever could come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;aw that, without an intelligent De|&s;ire, no Creature could be excellent, or formed in his Likene&s;s. But he &s;aw al&s;o that, unle&s;s &s;uch Intelligence &s;hould be ruled by his Wi&s;dom, and &s;uch a De&s;ire wholly conformable to his Will, the Crea|ture could not be wi&s;e, the Creature could not be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="118">
In the Po&s;&s;ibility of the Creature's De&s;ire of Independence, God &s;aw the Po&s;&s;ibility of moral and natural Evil: But he &s;aw that &s;uch partial and temporary Evil might be converted to the Production of an Infinity of Good; and he &s;aw that, without the Ad|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Evil, the Good that bore Relation thereto could not ari&s;e.</P>
<P>He knew that, till the Lap&s;e or Falling off of &s;ome of his Creatures, his own in|finite Attributes could not duely be mani|fe&s;ted, could not be duely adored in the Glory of their Contra&s;t. That no Crea|ture, till then, could be duely &s;en&s;ible of its own Fallibility, could be duely &s;en&s;i|ble that Sufficiency and Perfection were &s;olely in God, and that all Things depend|ed on him as well for every Quality of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s as of Being.</P>
<P>He fore&s;aw all the Mi&s;ery that &s;hould attend upon Error; but he &s;aw al&s;o how amiable, how beneficial was the Sen&s;e of &s;uch Error; how it might &s;erve to &s;ap the Self-Confidence of the Creature, and en|gage him to ca&s;t his Tru&s;t where his Strength alone lay. And he the more willingly permitted the Sufferings of all his fallen Offspring, as the future bli&s;sful Period was already pre&s;ent to him, when the Mi&s;eries of the &s;hort Parenthe&s;is (called
<PB N="120" REF="119">Time) &s;hould be for ever &s;hut up between the two Eternities; and when all his be|loved and rectified Creatures &s;hould enter upon the Fullne&s;s of the Enjoyment of their God.</P>
<P>From the Blackne&s;s of Guilt, and the Cloud of Pains, Calamities, Di&s;ea&s;es, and Deaths, God &s;aw Remor&s;e, Contrition, Humility, Patience, and Re&s;ignation, beam|ing forth into new Wonders of Light and eternal Life. He &s;aw new Relations, new Connections, new Endearments ari&s;e, be|tween <HI>Creatorly</HI> Good and <HI>Creaturely</HI> Evil, between Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Redemption, Repentance and Pardon; and he joyed (without Beginning) in calling his loved Offspring from Error to Rectitude, from Lowline&s;s to Exaltation, from Death into Life, from Time to Eternity, and from tran&s;itory Afflictions into ever enduring and ever encrea&s;ing Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>God fore&s;aw, in future Worlds of new and wonderful Con&s;truction, the Frailty and Lap&s;e of his favourite Family of Man. He &s;aw him &s;unk into the Inclemency of outward Elements, and into the inward Darkne&s;s and Wrath of his di&s;tinct and li|mited Nature; externally be&s;ieged and tempted by lying Offers of Enjoyment, and internally rent by di&s;appointed De&s;ires and malignant Pa&s;&s;ions. But, he had provided
<PB N="121" REF="120">a Redemption of &s;uch &s;tupendous Potency, as would not &s;uffer the perver&s;e Creature to tear it&s;elf out of the Arms of his Affecti|on. He had provided a Seed of the SON OF HIS LOVE, that &s;hould take Root in Man's World of inward and outward Evil; that &s;hould grow as a fragrant Flower, through Corruption and Abomination, in|to the Freedom, the Light and the Purity of Heaven; that &s;hould reprove his Un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;hould convict him of Wickedne&s;s, that &s;hould convince him of Weakne&s;s, and &s;often him into Sorrow for his own Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; that &s;hould melt him into a Sen&s;e of the Calamity of others; that &s;hould diffu&s;e as a dawning Light through his dark and angry Nature, &s;ub|duing his Pride, a&s;&s;uaging his Pa&s;&s;ions; calling him forth from Self into the Expan|&s;ion of Benevolence, into all the Charities and Amities, the Feelings and Offices of the human Heart thus made divine; and la&s;tly, maturing in him a different Nature and a new Creature; that God may be in all Men the ONE WILL TO THE ONE GOODNESS; thereby uniting all Men, as one Man, in their God. For deep, indeed, are all his Coun&s;els; and all the Mazes of his Providence will finally unwind them|&s;elves in the Rectitude and Fulne&s;s of the Wi&s;dom of his Love.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121">
That a Creature, inexperienced or newly brought into Being, &s;hould &s;tand in the State in which he felt his Delight: Or even, that he &s;hould fall therefrom, by attempting at &s;omething, through an own Will, and the Pre&s;umption of an own Power; does not appear to have any Thing very wonderful in it. But that a Crea|ture, already fallen into the Mi&s;ery and Depravity of a &s;econd and ba&s;e Nature, &s;hould ri&s;e again &s;uperior to its original Goodne&s;s and Glory; this is the Work, produced in Time, that will be Matter of chief Amazement throughout the &s;econd Eternity.</P>
<P>That Man, I &s;ay, fallen into a Body of be&s;|tial Fle&s;h and Members, fallen into the Pro|perties of a dark and wrathful Nature; fallen into circling Elements of Ho&s;tility, Di&s;tem|perature and Di&s;&s;olution to his Frame; that Man, I repeat it, thus degraded and weak|ened, thus oppre&s;&s;ed and a&s;&s;aulted from within and from without, &s;hould yet ad|vance and proceed through his Cour&s;e of appointed Warfare, denying his own Ap|petites, pulling down his own Pride, com|bating Sufferings with Patience, &s;ubdu|ing Injuries with Love, delighting to labour under the hinder Part of that Cro&s;s which <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Cyrenian</HI> was compelled to bear; conquering, ri&s;ing, triumphing over

<P>Here, Brother, &s;aid the Earl, you ex|pre&s;sly acknowledge that Man is a free Agent.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> that Man has a Principle or Seed of Liber|ty within him, a Power of turning, or at lea&s;t of leaving his Will to the Impul&s;e of Good, on the one Hand, or of Evil on the Other, he could not otherwi&s;e be account|able; and this brings me directly to your Lord&s;hip's Que&s;tion re&s;pecting the Di&s;tinc|tion, in Matter of Merit, between Man and Man.</P>
<P>KNOW THYSELF, was the wi&s;e&s;t of all the <HI>Saws</HI> in the ancient Schools; for the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all Studies, to Man, is that of Man.</P>
<P>MAN has been repre&s;ented, by the Boa&s;tings of pagan Philo&s;ophy, as equal in
<PB N="124" REF="123">many Re&s;pects, and in &s;ome Articles &s;upe|rior to what they conceived of Godhead.</P>
<P>They define him a rational and lordly Intelligence, &s;ole Dictator to his own Acti|ons, Controuler of his own Pa&s;&s;ions, and of Powers, Virtues, and Faculties, wholly free and independent. But, what &s;ays Na|ture on this Head?</P>
<P>Man goes out of this World, even as he comes into it, quite pa&s;&s;ive and without his own Con&s;ent. From the Womb to the Time of his maturing in Rea&s;on, and even till &s;ome Degree of Power is awakened in him toward governing his Appetites and re&s;i&s;ting his Inclinations, he is as merely a &s;en&s;ual and &s;ervile Machine as any inferior Animal or Brute in the Creation. His Pul&s;es beat, his Blood cruclates, and all the Offices of Re&s;piration, Secretion, and Per&s;piration are performed, alike awake as a&s;leep, without any more Attention or Care, on his Part, than if he had no Intere&s;t or Concern therein.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, he is begirt by out|ward Objects, and outward Elements, that hold an intimate Corre&s;pondence and perpe|tual Communication with his Fle&s;h, with all his Organs, and his animal Life; excit|ing in him a Variety of Appetites and De|&s;ires that he can no more re&s;i&s;t, than a
<PB N="125" REF="124">Twig can &s;wim again&s;t a Torrent; in&s;o|much that, were this the Whole of the Man, with Re&s;pect to his Appetites, he would of Nece&s;&s;ity be a Brute, and with Re&s;pect to his Pa&s;&s;ions, he would of Nece&s;&s;ity be a Devil.</P>
<P>Thus far, my Lord, you &s;ee that Man is wholly acted upon, and does nothing but as he is incited or impelled thereto; and were there no other Agent within him to act upon him on the oppo&s;ite Part, had he no pre&s;ent Friend to combat with and controul the evil Propen&s;ities of his Nature, he would be as totally a Slave to his carnal and diabolical Lu&s;ts, as the Galley-Rower is to the Bench whereon he is chained.</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be our all-creating, all-re|deeming, and all-loving Friend, who is ever pre&s;ent in us and to us, and does not leave our Impotence de&s;titute of his Help; who, in the Centre of our old and reprobat|ed <HI>Adam,</HI> hath implanted a divine Seed of a new Nature and a new Creature; even the renewed Image of him&s;elf in our Souls. It is this infant Re&s;emblance of him&s;elf in our E&s;&s;ence, which God always cheri&s;hes, which he always elects, which he pur&s;ues; which he calls upon by the Word of the Son of his Love, which he informs with the Breath of his holy Spirit, whi&s;pering
<PB N="126" REF="125">into it the &s;till Voice of his own beatifying Affections.</P>
<P>Now, though the&s;e two Seeds or Princi|ples are &s;o intimately united in us, that very few ob&s;erve any Di&s;tinction between them, yet no two Things can be more oppo&s;ite than they are to Each Other, both in their Natures and Propen&s;ities. And, accor|dingly, the great Apo&s;tle, <HI>Paul,</HI> hath &s;pe|cified and marked out their &s;eparate Offices and Departments with the mo&s;t exact Pre|ci&s;ion. Reach me yonder Bible, <HI>Harry,</HI>&mdash; Here it is.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>That which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I con&s;ent unto the Law, that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my Fle&s;h) dwelleth no good Thing; for to will is pre&s;ent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the Good that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a Law, that when I would do Good, Evil is pre|&s;ent with me. For I delight in the Law of God, <HI>after the inward Man.</HI> But I
<PB N="127" REF="126">&s;ee another Law in my Members, war|ring again&s;t the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members. O, wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deli|ver me from the Body of this Death!</Q></P>
<P>Here, my Friends, You &s;ee, the Apo&s;tle di&s;tingui&s;hes, mo&s;t preci&s;ely, between the oppo&s;ite Natures and Tendencies of the two &s;everal Seeds of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and the <HI>&s;econd Adam,</HI> between the <HI>Outward</HI> and <HI>Inward,</HI> the <HI>Vitiated</HI> and <HI>Regenerate,</HI> the <HI>Old</HI> and the <HI>New Man.</HI> The <HI>Old</HI> warring again&s;t the <HI>New,</HI> and endeavouring to bring him into Captivity to Sin and Death; in&s;omuch that our own evil <HI>Cain</HI> would willingly &s;lay out|right the good <HI>Abel</HI> that is in us.</P>
<P>Now, between the&s;e adver&s;e Offsprings of the earthly and heavenly <HI>Adams,</HI> our <HI>Will,</HI> or <HI>Principle of Freedom,</HI> or <HI>Power of Election,</HI> is placed.</P>
<P>On the one Part, we are be&s;ieged and a&s;&s;ailed by a World of tempting and &s;edu|cing Objects, that hold intimate Intercour&s;e with our Fle&s;h and carnal Sen&s;ibilities, and impel their Influences on our Spirit, through every Organ. While the Rulers in Darkne&s;s, enter through the &s;aid &s;en&s;ual Avenues, excite their diabolical Pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="128" REF="127">within us, and begin to open a Kingdom of their own in our Soul.</P>
<P>On the contrary Part, our heavenly Fa|ther is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to act upon us, through the kindred Seed of that divine Nature which he had implanted in our E&s;&s;ence. He attracts us &s;trongly though not forcibly; and he &s;heds into us a Species of mental Feelings and Affections, to which Fle&s;h and Blood is wholly an Alien.</P>
<P>Here then, when the Will turns away, from divine Influence, and delivers it&s;elf up to the Impul&s;es and Operations of the evil Agents, the whole Man becomes a Pri|&s;oner in the Regions of Darkne&s;s and Sha|dows of Death, and Nothing but inten&s;e Sufferings can awake him to a Sen&s;e of the Error, In&s;ufficiency, and Folly of his Pur|&s;uits, and of the Lo&s;s and Horror of the State in which he lies.</P>
<P>But, when the Will turns and yields it|&s;elf to the gracious Drawings and Influence of God's ble&s;&s;ing Spirit; God opens him|&s;elf unto it, and attracts it &s;till more powerfully, till he gradually delivers it from the Slavery of Sen&s;e, of Sin, and of Self, into the perfect Freedom of a willing Ser|vice to Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="128">
Above all, when the Will is a&s;&s;aulted by violent, pre&s;&s;ing, and permanent Tempta|tions; if yet, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;up|porting Grace, it &s;trives and &s;truggles to maintain the Fight, and to tear it&s;elf away from the Cu&s;tody of Evil, though angui&s;h|ing in the Strife, and pierced, even to the dividing of the Bone from the Marrow; then is the Scripture fulfilled that &s;ays, <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force;</HI> then is our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in the highe&s;t Height of his Throne and Do|minion; then does he deem all his Suffer|ings overpaid; and he will, him&s;elf, be the Champion in the Will of &s;uch a Cham|pion, and he will fight the good Fight, and run the good Cour&s;e, and hold fa&s;t the good Faith both in him and for him, and he will impute the Whole of his Con|que&s;ts to the willing In&s;trument of his Ope|rations, and will crown him with the Crown of his own Glory, and will &s;tretch out his Exi&s;tence to the Reception and Expan&s;ion of his whole Heaven within him.</P>
<P>Here then, my honoured Brother, You have your Que&s;tion fully an&s;wered touching the Difference, in Point of Merit, between Man and Man; &s;ince no Creature can have any Merit &s;ave &s;o far as he opens his Will to the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Goodne&s;s of God upon his Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="129">
What, you will &s;ay, is this the utmo&s;t Merit that the Be&s;t of Men can boa&s;t, that of barely yielding his Will to the Drawings and Influence of the Spirit of Goodne&s;s? &mdash;It is, indeed, my Lord, the very Whole of the Merit that any Creature can have, as his own Merit; the very utmo&s;t that he can do toward co-operating with his God, and conducing, in any Degree, to his own Salvation and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>O, that all Men, that all Men had this Merit, my Friends! that All would open the Gates of their everla&s;ting Souls, and humbly and earne&s;tly petition the King of Glory to come in! This would lead to ever during and ever encrea&s;ing Merit; for our God would then impute his own Me|rits unto us, not by an outward but inward Imputation, even the feeling Sen&s;e and Participation of his Nature, his Powers, and Qualities within us. We &s;hould become good in his Goodne&s;s, wi&s;e in his Wi&s;dom, and &s;trong in his Omnipotence. By re&s;ign|ing and &s;urrendring, to him, our dark, empty, hungry, and uncomfortable Crea|ture; we &s;hould gain, in lieu thereof, the Plenitude of the rich and illuminating Creator. The Fulne&s;s of all Delight would become our Portion and Inheritance; and the Proprietor of the Univer&s;e would be our Property and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

Our dear <HI>Meekly,</HI> here, and I had &s;ome former Conver&s;e on a few of the&s;e deep Subjects, and I received much Sati&s;|faction and In&s;truction from him; but he was not quite &s;o explicit and convincing as You have been.</P>
<P>Ah, my Lord, cried <HI>Meekly,</HI> were I as intimate with the Fountain of all Know|ledge, as your precious Brother is, You would not then have po&s;ed me in the Con|ver&s;ation we la&s;t held on tho&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>On the following Day, at Breakfa&s;t, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> took out his Pocket-Book, and pro|duced Bank and Stock-Bills to the amount of &s;omething upward of three thou&s;and Pounds. He then pre&s;ented them to Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and &s;aid, Here, Sir, is a little Mat|ter toward Repayment of the Loan I had from You in <HI>Holland.</HI> I ble&s;s, I ble&s;s my God, that he has enabled me, thus far, to
<PB N="132" REF="131">approve my&s;elf an hone&s;t Man; but, above all, I ble&s;s him for giving me once more a Sight of the gracious Countenance of my Patron. But for You, I had mi&s;erably peri&s;hed in a Dungeon; to You, Sir, I owe my Liberty, to You I owe my Life, to You I owe the Recovery of the Inheri|tance of my Fathers. With Re&s;pect to &s;uch Obligations I am indeed a beggar'd In&s;olvent. But, my Heart is plea&s;ed with the Thought, that the Connection between us, of Creditor on your Part and of Debtor on mine, &s;hould remain on Record to all Eternity.</P>
<P>Here, the worthy <HI>Meekly</HI> became op|pre&s;&s;ed under Sen&s;ations of grateful Recol|lection, and, putting his Handkerchief to his Eyes, he &s;obbed out his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> held the Bills in his Hand, and carele&s;ly ca&s;ting his Eye over them perceived the Amount. As &s;oon as he &s;aw that his Friend's Emotion had partly &s;ub&s;ided, You have, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;ays he, You have been quite a Go&s;pel Steward, and have returned me my Own with mo&s;t unlooked for U&s;ury, and I hear|tily pray God, in Recompen&s;e of your In|tegrity, to give You the Principality of ma|ny Cities in the coming Kingdom of his Son. But what &s;hall I do with this Money,
<PB N="133" REF="132">my dear <HI>Meekly?</HI> My Wealth already overflows, it is my only Trouble, my only Incumbrance. It claims my Attention, indeed, as it is a Tru&s;t for which I know I am &s;trictly accountable. But I heartily wi&s;h that Providence would reclaim the Whole to him&s;elf, and leave me as One of his Mendicants, who daily wait on the Hand that &s;upplieth All, who &s;eek his Kingdom, with nece&s;&s;ary Things. For my <HI>Harry</HI> has enough, and more than enough, now, in the Abundance of his no|ble Father. You mu&s;t therefore keep the&s;e Bills to your&s;elf, my worthy Friend; retain, or give, or di&s;po&s;e of them, even as it &s;hall plea&s;e You; whether as your Pro|perty or as my Property, it matters not Six-pence; but, take them back, you mu&s;t take them back indeed, my <HI>Meekly.</HI> And &s;o &s;aying, he &s;hoved them over from him, on the Table.</P>
<P>Ah, my mo&s;t honoured Sir, exclaimed the repining <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;ure You would not &s;erve me &s;o! My Soul is but ju&s;t ea&s;ed of a Load that lay heavy on it for many, many Years. Be not then &s;o &s;evere as to replace the Burden upon me. It would break my very Heart, &s;hould you per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing this little In&s;tance of Acknowledgment from One of your warme&s;t Lovers.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="133">
Here, <HI>Harry</HI> found him&s;elf affected and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the Parties, and, in order to relieve them, took the Deci&s;ion of the Mat|ter upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;ays he, I will, with your good Plea&s;ure, put a very quick End to this Di&s;pute, and I offer my&s;elf to You, as your joint Tru&s;tee, to be your Almoner and Di&s;po&s;er of the&s;e Bills.</P>
<P>As I was lately on my Rambles, through &s;ome Villages near <HI>London,</HI> the Jingle of a Number of infant Voices &s;truck my Ear, and turning, and looking in at the Ground-Floor of a long Cottage, I perceived about thirty little Girls neatly dre&s;&s;ed in a Uni|form, and All very bu&s;ily and variou&s;ly employed, in hackling, carding, knitting, or &s;pinning, or in &s;ewing at their Sampler, or in learning their Letters and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>The adjoining Hou&s;e contained about an equal Number of Boys, mo&s;t of whom were occupied in learning the Rudiments of the &s;everal Handy-Crafts; while the re&s;t were bu&s;ied in cultivating a back Field, intended as a Garden for the&s;e two young Families.</P>
<P>I was &s;o plea&s;ed with what I &s;aw, that I gave the Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;ome &s;mall
<PB N="135" REF="134">Matter; and I re&s;olved, within my&s;elf, if ever I &s;hould be able, to gather together a little Family of my own for the like Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, here comes Mr. <HI>Meek|ly</HI>'s Money quite in Sea&s;on for &s;aving ju&s;t &s;o much of my own. But hang it, &s;ince I am grown &s;uddenly rich, I think I will be generous for once in my Life, and add as much more out of my proper Stock. I &s;hall al&s;o make &s;o free as to draw on my Uncle there for the like Sum; and the&s;e, totted together, will make a pretty Begin|ning of my little Project. As to my poor Father here, he has nothing to &s;pare, for he has already lavi&s;hed all his Wealth on his naughty Boy.</P>
<P>My Lord and the Company laughed hear|tily at <HI>Harry</HI>'s little Plea&s;antry&mdash;But hearkee, hone&s;t Friend, added the Earl, you mu&s;t not think to expo&s;e me, by leav|ing me out of your Scheme; can't you lend me as much, <HI>Harry,</HI> as will an&s;wer my Quota? Yes, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> upon proper Securities, I think I may ven|ture. You are a Rogue, and a Darling, and my Trea&s;ure, and my Honour, and my Ornament, cried the Earl, turning and bending fondly toward him. While <HI>Harry</HI>'s Eyes began to &s;wim with Plea&s;ure, and,
<PB N="136" REF="135">ca&s;ting him&s;elf into his Father's Bo&s;om, he there hid the Tears of his &s;welling De|light; while Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> &s;at, &s;ilently wrapt in the Enjoyment of the tender Scene.</P>
<P>When <HI>Harry</HI> was re&s;eated, Gentlemen, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t bid you adieu. I am en|gaged on a Party in the Village this Morn|ing. For this Day, I mu&s;t quit the Ho|nour of being your Lord&s;hip's Son, and &s;hall content my&s;elf with the Station of One of your Va&s;&s;als or Dependants; and &s;o &s;aying he ro&s;e, and away he &s;hot.</P>
<P>Immediately the Earl rung the Bell, and Mr. <HI>John</HI> entered. <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid he, do you know any thing of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Expedition into our Town to Day? Why, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>John,</HI> our loving Town&s;men have agreed to do all the Honour they can to the Ar|rival and Welcome of your honourable Brother. The Day is to be &s;pent in Sports; and To-morrow is to be lighted up with the Bonfires and 'Luminations of this very Night. There is a Football al&s;o to be, and I fancy that my Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> de|&s;igns to be no better than a Hail Fellow among them.</P>
<P>Tell me then, my good <HI>John,</HI> could you contrive &s;o as to place us where we might &s;ee &s;ome of the&s;e Diver&s;ions without
<PB N="137" REF="136">being &s;een? Why, plea&s;e your Honours, the Football is to be in our Park; and I can rai&s;e a Stage of Boards where, by the Help of a Step Ladder, your Honours may get up, and peep over, and &s;o &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;es. Get it done then, get it done, good <HI>John,</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>When <HI>John</HI> had gone out to execute his Commi&s;&s;ion, I believe Sir, &s;aid <HI>Meekly</HI> to Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> that there is not &s;uch a Boy, as your Nephew, no, not in the whole Univer&s;e; every Look and Accent, every Motion, Fibre and Member, &s;o won|derfully an&s;wering, to the Meekne&s;s and Mode&s;ty, the Honour, the Galantry and Intrepedity of his Spirit. He &s;hrinks from Prai&s;e, he is a&s;hamed before it; and yet his Words &s;ink, as Balm on the Heart, and his Actions compel People to affront him with rejected Honours whereever he goes. While I look on his lovely and lowly Countenance, and inwardly em|brace him as I would a Part or Portion of my God; I &s;ecretly &s;ay to my&s;elf, you are a Proof, my <HI>Harry,</HI> that the lower the Roots of Humility &s;trike into the Depths beneath, the more the exalted Branches a&s;cend the Heights of Heaven! I attend, I &s;tudy him, as well for my In&s;truction as Delight, and look upon and revere him, as the mo&s;t perfect Copy that ever yet was
<PB N="138" REF="137">taken of the omnipotent Babe in the Manger.</P>
<P>The other Day, he pre&s;erved his noble Father and me from being rent in Pieces by a mad and foaming Mon&s;ter of a Ma&s;|tiff. But, his Calmne&s;s of Courage with his Quickne&s;s of Action, his Prowe&s;s and Power, on that Occa&s;ion, exceeded all that I ever met with in Fable. Pray, my Lord, have you not yet told you Brother of that wonderful Incident? No indeed, &s;aid the Earl, my <HI>Harry</HI> continued with us, till within this Minute, and I was cautious of offending him by mentioning the Matter before him. For, he can &s;carce bear to be thanked for the Charity that he gives, and much le&s;s to be prai&s;ed for any Virtue or Accompli&s;hment. O, my Brother, my Brother, what do I not owe you? a Debt immen&s;e indeed, never, never, to be paid, for this precious, this ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure of a Boy!</P>
<P>Ah, my Lord, cried Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> I am already overpaid; your Pearl has over|paid me for all my poli&s;hing. Nay, I am become his Debtor, I am indebted to him for my Life, if that were a Thing of Va|lue. It is now about three Weeks &s;ince he delivered me from the greate&s;t Peril I ever was in, and in the wonderful Manner I am going to tell you.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="138">
The Day before he &s;et out for this Place, I de&s;ired him to take a Walk with me in the Fields, where I inteded gradually to di&s;cover to him the heavy Tidings of the Death of his Mother and Brother.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I began to open the Matter to him, I heard a &s;udden and terrifying Roar, and turning my Eye to the Place from whence it came, I perceived a mon&s;trous Bull, tearing the Ground with his Foot, and denouncing his Wrath in the Voice of Thunder, when, quitting a few Kine a|mong whom he &s;tood, he made directly at us. In&s;tantly I cried out to <HI>Harry,</HI> and charged him to fly for his Life, but in&s;tead of obeying me, he advanced with a ha&s;ty Pace to meet the enraged Animal.</P>
<P>Never was I in &s;uch a Pannic as I then was for our precious Boy. I &s;hook from Head to Foot, and was ju&s;t going to drop, when the furious Bea&s;t &s;tooped his Head to da&s;h our Child to Pieces; but <HI>Harry,</HI> quick as Thought, laid hold on a Horn with one of his Hands, and ri&s;ing into the Air, threw him&s;elf a&s;tride upon the Creature's Neck.</P>
<P>The Bull plunged, and to&s;&s;ed, and tore about at a frantic Rate, endeavouring to
<PB N="140" REF="139">di&s;encumber him&s;elf of his Rider, while <HI>Harry</HI> took out his Penknife and urged him to greater Madne&s;s by pricking him with the Point. At length the Mon&s;ter, all panting, and white with Foam, &s;tood &s;till as a Po&s;t. When <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;tooping, made Way through his Hide, opened the jugular Vein, and cut his Windpipe in two, and, after &s;ome imperfect Roars, the Creature &s;unk breathle&s;s beneath him.</P>
<P>Think of my Tran&s;ports then, my Bro|ther, when I &s;aw my Hero &s;afe and &s;mil|ingly triumphant. I &s;aid and did Things, I believe, that were quite be&s;ide my Rea|&s;on; but I &s;hall not be &s;o readily alarmed for him, hereafter, as I &s;ee that his Action, Intrepidity, and Pre&s;ence of Mind, make him more than a Match for any living Creature.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Time after, <HI>John</HI> returned and gave his Lord Notice that their Station was prepared, whereupon our Company i&s;&s;ued forth and a&s;cended their Seat of Eminence, where, through the Cover of &s;ome Trees, they could &s;ee and ob&s;erve without being ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>After they had been &s;eated and had talked awhile, of Truth, the LORD, OUR RIGH|TEOUSNESS, of Heart felt Peace, and the fearful looking out for Judgment from the
<PB N="141" REF="140">God of Love, a promi&s;cuous Crowd of many Hundreds of Old and Young, Male, and Female, entered and flooded the Park.</P>
<P>As All thronged about <HI>Harry</HI> with an affectionate Familiarity; he appointed that Football &s;hould begin the Sports; and, two Champions being cho&s;en, Each of them cho&s;e his Man, and that Man Ano|ther, alternately, till about forty &s;trenuous and active Youths were ranged on either Side.</P>
<P>The Field was then divided, and the Ball being to&s;&s;ed aloft in the Mid&s;t, they All mingled and jo&s;tled together, like Hail|&s;tones; till, after much running, wre&s;tling and &s;weating, two Games were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively lo&s;t on the Side of the Party where <HI>Harry</HI> had ranged him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ah, cried the Earl, my poor <HI>Harry,</HI> I find, is not accu&s;tomed to rude Sports of this Kind; whereupon Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> laughed and cried, he is a Rogue, he is a Rogue, as you will quickly &s;ee, my Lord.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> exclaimed his A&s;&s;ociates, had you &s;taid among us, in|&s;tead of going to that dull and heavy heeled <HI>London,</HI> we would have taught you to play Football better than you do.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="141">
I never play right, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> but when the Girls are on my Side. And here I lay a Wager of twenty Guineas, in Hands of my Daddy <HI>Dob&s;on,</HI> that, give me but my Choice, Twenty of the&s;e pretty La&s;&s;es, and I will beat your two Parties of Four&s;core from one Barrier to the other. What &s;ay you, <HI>Polly Truck,</HI> will you be on my Side? I will &s;ide with your Honour again&s;t the World, cried <HI>Polly,</HI> and away went her Clothes to her Jacket and under Petticoat.</P>
<P>On this facetious Propo&s;al of our Hero's, a loud Roar and Laugh was &s;et up, that la&s;ted a long Time. Well, well, Gentle|men, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> I will give you leave to double your Laugh as &s;oon as you are Winners. In the mean Time, my good <HI>Polly,</HI> be plea&s;ed to choo&s;e me out the re&s;t of our fair Fellows at Football.</P>
<P>When this was done, <HI>Harry</HI> took them All, both Males and Females, to the ex|tremity of the Barrier ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to his Father, extending to about a Mile in Length; and, while the Girls &s;tood pant|ing through Fear and Emulation behind him, he took the Ball in Hand, and, throwing it into the Air, gave it a Kick, as it de&s;cended, aloof from his Adver&s;aries who were ranged directly again&s;t him, and
<PB N="143" REF="142">then following it, like a Bullet, he gave it another Kick before it touched the Ground, and pur&s;ued and pur&s;ued it, with a&s;toni&s;h|ing Rapidity, till he gave it the la&s;t Kick, high over the Trees that reached high over the Wall and over the Heads of his Parents.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, <HI>Polly Truck,</HI> had followed her beloved Patron with all ima|ginable Zeal and Speed, and had over|run all the Lads by near a Furlong. At la&s;t &s;he came up to <HI>Harry</HI> panting and quite &s;pent, and wi&s;hed to wi&s;h him much Joy but was not able.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Things were in Agitation, our Company beheld All from behind their Cover, and, as <HI>Harry</HI> approached, their Hearts beat a quick and equal Mea&s;ure with his Feet, even with &s;uch Emotions as <HI>Virgil</HI> a&s;cribes to the Bo&s;om of <HI>Latona,</HI> while &s;he beholds and contemplates her fair Daughter <HI>Dian</HI> &s;o eminently tran&s;cend|ing the Choru&s;es of her Nymphs in Grace, Beauty, and Excellence.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Polly Truck</HI> was come to her Speech, Laws, your Honour! &s;ays &s;he, where in the World do you contrive to hide your Wings? I have nine Holland Smocks that I won by running at nine
<PB N="144" REF="143">Wakes, and never was beaten before, in my Life. <HI>Harry</HI> laughed, and gave his quondam Playfellow a friendly Shake of the Hand.</P>
<P>The Company now began to come in apace, though yet awhile incapable of Utterance; but, gathering about <HI>Harry,</HI> they &s;ilently eyed him from Head to Foot, and beheld him with a Kind of venerating A&s;toni&s;hment. At la&s;t, young <HI>Fel&s;ter</HI> (the Wit of the Town) cries, I have al|ways heared, till now, that All were Fel|lows at Football, but here is One, I am &s;ure, who has no Fellow. I will bet up|on his Head, or rather on his Heels, a|gain&s;t the ninety-nine Shires, and de&s;ire no better than Cripples to &s;ide him.</P>
<P>At length Old and Young, Men and Maidens, got once more together; and the Que&s;tion was &s;tarted concerning the next Sports upon which they &s;hould enter, when they beheld a mighty Giant ap|proaching with Strides that would have &s;uited the Arch of a River. He was called, by way of Eminence, the great <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;stown,</HI> and was accompanied by his Kin&s;man, <HI>Pelt</HI> the Tanner.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Roger</HI> came up, he very af|fectionately &s;aluted tho&s;e of his Acquain|tance,
<PB N="145" REF="144">a&s;king, what Sport have ye got forward, my brave Boys? The be&s;t Sport, an&s;wered <HI>Jack Fel&s;ter,</HI> would be to &s;ee your Highne&s;s, Mr. <HI>Roger,</HI> get a Fall before Night. That Man, cried <HI>Pelt,</HI> does not &s;tep on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground who will ever be able to crack of that Feat. Why, as to that Matter, &s;aid <HI>Roger,</HI> though I ro&s;e early this Morning, I have a &s;trong Fancy that I am up for the whole Day. <HI>Tom Truck,</HI> cries <HI>Fel&s;ter,</HI> if you will get on one Side of him, I will get on 'tother, and try what Hand we can make of this famous Champion.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Attack began; but <HI>Roger</HI> &s;miled &s;uperior, and handled and played them together as a Show-Man plays his Puppits. Another Wre&s;tler was then added, and then Another, but the Four could no more move him than if he were a Tower; while he lifted them up, in Turns, and laid them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively on the Ground, with the be&s;t natured Cau|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then came &s;milingly up and &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Roger</HI> if you'll be &s;o kind to teach me the Art of Wre&s;tling, I will make you a Pre&s;ent of twenty Guineas for your Pains, my Daddy <HI>Dob&s;on</HI> there has the Money in his Pocket. <HI>Roger</HI> here &s;urveyed our Hero
<PB N="146" REF="145">with the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive Attention. I rejoice to &s;ee your Honour, &s;ays he, with all my Heart; and indeed, it was for that only Purpo&s;e that I came here to Day, having already heard the Story of my Cou&s;in's great Ma&s;tiff. But, Sir, as you were propo&s;ing, and as I hone&s;tly think, you may do wonderfully well for a Wre&s;t|ler of Quality; for you are exceeding finely made as any Thing can po&s;&s;ibly be for the Volume of you; and, as the Jockeys &s;ay, are the prettie&s;t Fellow of your Inches I ever &s;et my Eyes on. But, you want &s;omething of my Bulk, Ma&s;ter, to give you the full Powers. However, I thank your Honour for your generous Proffer, I am ready to enter on my Office whenever you plea&s;e; and I hope to make the very mo&s;t of the little Matter that is in you.</P>
<P>They then grappled, not as Combatants, but as Tutor and Pupil, and the Rogue <HI>Harry</HI> &s;ubmitted him&s;elf, as a pliant Twig in his Hands, while <HI>Roger</HI> continued to initiate him in this Trip and that Trip, and in the various Methods of a&s;&s;ailing and evading. When <HI>Harry,</HI> perceiving his In&s;tructor a little overpoi&s;ed, &s;uddenly gave him an in&s;ide Foot, and a Pu&s;h at the &s;ame In&s;tant toward the Part to which he inclined. &mdash; Strait, like a Promon|tory &s;apped with all its Pines, nine Paces
<PB N="147" REF="146">huge the Giant &s;idelong veered, the tenth, on bended Knee, his mighty Arm up&s;taid. &mdash; Amazement filled the ru&s;tic Pow|ers, to &s;ee with &s;uch Slight moved their Mightie&s;t, and a univer&s;al Shout rent the wide Welkin.</P>
<P><HI>Roger</HI> ro&s;e and returned &s;omething aba&s;h|ed at his Foil; but &s;aid, with apparent good Humour, I am &s;orry that I have not twenty Guineas in my Pocket to pay your Honour, for &s;hewing me that &s;ame Trip. However, I hope you will give me one Turn more for the Victory. I now engage you, as a Learner, not as a Teacher. As you will, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Here, <HI>Roger</HI> laid hold on <HI>Harry,</HI> with a truly ho&s;tile Gripe, while <HI>Harry</HI> &s;eized his brawny Mu&s;cles, as with little Cramps of Steel. Then was &s;een, on either Side, the long calculated Proportions of Weight again&s;t Action, and of Action again&s;t Weight. <HI>Roger</HI> &s;everal Times a&s;&s;ayed to lift our Hero between his Hands, and to lay him, as he had &s;erved the other Pea|&s;ants, on the Ground, but could not com|pel him to quit his Gripes. He then &s;way|ed him hither and thither, and thru&s;t him from him and pulled him to him, and hooked and tripped him on every Side, but felt him&s;elf often &s;taggered by the
<PB N="148" REF="147">quick Efforts of <HI>Harry,</HI> while the Scales of Conte&s;t &s;eemed alternately inclining to either Part. At length, <HI>Roger,</HI> beginning to find him&s;elf overbreathed, plucked his Adver&s;ary to him, and, bending heavily forward, over&s;hadowed and overbore our Hero to the Earth.</P>
<P>Great <HI>Roger</HI> then ro&s;e triumphant, and <HI>Harry</HI> al&s;o aro&s;e in the be&s;t Humour ima|ginable. Mr. <HI>Roger,</HI> &s;ays he, I hold it truly an Honour that you think me worthy of Contention, although you have conquer|ed. But this has been a Kind of Fling for which I don't owe you a Farthing, till you can make me of a Bulk approaching to your&s;elf. But come, Mr. <HI>Roger,</HI> I will not take you at an Advantage, recover your Breath, and then, as you &s;aid to me, I hope you will give me another Chance for the Victory.</P>
<P>Soon after the Combatants again engag|ed, and mutually exerted their very ut|mo&s;t; <HI>Roger</HI> for &s;aving his Honour, and <HI>Harry</HI> for preventing an open Di&s;grace before the Face of &s;o great an A&s;&s;embly. They &s;truggled, they put every Power of Strength and Art to the Proof; till <HI>Roger,</HI> finding him&s;elf beginning to fail, had re|cour&s;e to his former Stratagem, and, plucking <HI>Harry</HI> &s;uddenly to him, would again have overlaid him; but our Hero,
<PB N="149" REF="148">now aware, &s;lipped nimbly from under him, and &s;etting his right Foot before the right Foot of his Adver&s;ary, he gave a Shove, with his left Hand to the Other's right Shoulder, and pro&s;trate fell the great <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;stown,</HI> extended over half a Rood of Ground.</P>
<P>Then, indeed, the Clamours became immoderately high; young <HI>Fel&s;ter,</HI> above all Others, grew in&s;olently triumphant, and the Girls could &s;carce be detained on the Ground, while they clapped Hands, and &s;houted, and &s;prung up aloft, in the Con|gratulation of <HI>Harry</HI>'s unexpected Vic|tory.</P>
<P>Our Hero then very affectionately &s;tep|ped forward, and gave <HI>Roger</HI> a Hand to help him up, but he ro&s;e very &s;lowly, as he was &s;omething hurt by his Fall. Mr. <HI>Roger,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> I am now doubly your Debtor, and will accordingly pay you dou|ble Wages, as you have taught me, not only to throw Others, but to throw your|&s;elf al&s;o. Adad, cried <HI>Roger,</HI> I find and feel too, that you are already but too well taught to my Hand.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Harry</HI> had paid <HI>Roger</HI> his forty Guineas, Part of which he borrowed from Goodman <HI>Dem&s;ter, Roger</HI> &s;eized his Hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it ardently, he cried,
<PB N="150" REF="149">O my Conqueror, my Hero, my noble Child! throughout Life may all Enemies fall before you, nor Death it&s;elf be able to fling my Boy!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then the great Bell rung loudly for Dinner, and <HI>Harry,</HI> turning and mea&s;uring the Height of the Park Wall with a Glance of his Eye, took a &s;hort Race, and running up it &s;ome Steps, caught hold of the Cope|ing, and threw him&s;elf over, while all the A&s;&s;embly poured after him a Shout of A|mazement.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> happened to alight within a few Paces of the Stage where his Father and Uncle &s;at; but not attending to that, he was ha&s;tening homeward, when Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> cried out, Ho, ho, hone&s;t Friend, whither away &s;o fa&s;t? <HI>Harry</HI> &s;topped and &s;tarted, and turning about, looked &s;omething a|ba&s;hed to find that his &s;o highly revered Friends had been the Spectators of his lit|tle Feats and Follies; however he advanced toward them in order to help them down, while the Earl whi&s;pered to his Brother and &s;aid, Now we &s;hall &s;ee how proud our <HI>Harry</HI> will be of having overcome the fa|mous <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;stown.</HI></P>
<P>While they &s;at over a temperate Meal, why <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid the Earl &s;omewhat &s;lily,
<PB N="151" REF="150">the great <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;stown</HI> was but a Babe in your Hands. Ah, my Lord, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;miling and blu&s;hing, you are not yet rightly apprized how that Matter &s;tands. It co&s;t me no le&s;s than forty Guineas to prevail upon Mr. <HI>Roger</HI> to let me ca&s;t him; but, when your Lord&s;hip was a Boy, perhaps you would have thought it but a &s;mall Matter for the Pur|cha&s;e of Honour, e&s;pecially in the Eyes of the pretty Wenches. Indeed, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, I was a very, very naughty Boy at your Years; and, had I been &s;uch a Fellow as you are at this Day, I &s;hould have kept as large a Seraglio as the <HI>Sophy</HI> him&s;elf, and that al&s;o of willing and kind hearted Girls.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then <HI>John</HI> entered with Tidings that an Amba&s;&s;y of a Score of Wenches waited at the Hall-Door, and were pu&s;hing before them the prettie&s;t Maiden he ever beheld, to be their Spoke's-woman.</P>
<P>Immediately my Lord ordered that they &s;hould All be introduced, and quickly after a Clatter was hear'd without, crying, In|deed, indeed now, Mi&s;s <HI>Aggy,</HI> You mu&s;t and &s;hall &s;peak for us.</P>
<P>The Door was then thrown open, and a young Creature enter'd, colouring, panting,
<PB N="152" REF="151">and palpitating, and followed by the Group of Wenches who put her forward before them.</P>
<P>The Earl, in Pain for her &s;weet Confu&s;i|on, did his be&s;t to encourage her, and or|dered <HI>Harry</HI> to help them round with a Gla&s;s of Wine. By the Time that this was done, Mi&s;s <HI>Aggy</HI> became a little better a&s;|&s;ured, but had not yet dared to look One of them in the Face, but kept her Eyes bent on the Ground, as though &s;he had been a&s;hamed of their Brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>If&mdash;if&mdash;my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, (tremblingly and whi&s;peringly) if your honoured&mdash;your very honourable Brother is here&mdash;we come to invite him and his Company to our Town-Ball.&mdash;And we will attend you with Plea&s;ure, my little Angel, cried the Earl. But, pray who are you, and where do you live?&mdash;So plea&s;e You, my Father's Name is <HI>Abel Je&s;&s;amin,</HI> and he is lately come Tenant to Part of your Lord|&s;hip's E&s;tate.&mdash;Then I will make him a Pre&s;ent of at lea&s;t a Year's Rent for his fair Daughter's Sake. Here, <HI>John,</HI> give five Guineas apiece to the&s;e pretty La&s;&s;es to buy each of them a Riband. And, do you hear, bring me twenty Guineas for this their chief Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s.&mdash;Not for the World, my Lord, indeed I will not ac|cept a Farthing. My Father, though poor,
<PB N="153" REF="152">is very jealous of his Honour, and &s;hould I take any thing from any Man living, he would never &s;uffer me to darken the Light that &s;hines in at his Door.</P>
<P><HI>Aggy</HI> then made an elegant Courte&s;ey to the Ground, and retreated, attended by her own Graces, and by the revereing and affectionate Regards of the Company.</P>
<P>Who can this Creature be, cried out the Earl, &s;o lovely, &s;o uncommon, &s;uch a &s;weet Di&s;tinction about her! Ah, exclaimed Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> what a Pity it would be that &s;uch Innocence &s;hould be &s;educed, and &s;uch Pu|rity corrupted! And yet, that is mo&s;t like|ly to be the Ca&s;e, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;ince Beauty is the Bawd that procures its own undoing, and Loveline&s;s the very Magnet that attracts Men to its De&s;truction. <HI>Har|ry</HI> half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a Sigh, but &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;es were now immediatly order|ed to be put to, and our Company drove into the Town, accompanied by the Ac|clamations of Hundreds upon Hundreds who lined the Way.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they came to the Market Place, the Coach &s;et them down near a &s;pacious Flooring that was rai&s;ed, in open Air, about a Foot from the Ground, and
<PB N="154" REF="153">&s;urrounded with Benches behind Benches, and Benches above Benches, to a great Elevation.</P>
<P>When they were &s;hewn to the Seats prepared for them, they were &s;erved with a Variety of Wines and Cakes; for our open hearted Town&s;men had &s;pared no Co&s;t for the Entertainment of their noble Gue&s;ts and their Neighbours. The Band of Mu&s;ic (the choice&s;t that could be got) then &s;truck up, and the Jubilee was opened in full Triumph.</P>
<P>My Lord then wi&s;hed, in &s;ecret, that <HI>Harry</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI> would lead the Ball; but, ob&s;erving that his Son looked &s;omething dejected, he imputed it to Fa|tigue, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his De&s;ire. In the mean Time, the Lads and La&s;&s;es entered upon the Stage, and &s;everal footed it away featly and with all due Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>As <HI>Harry</HI> had not yet opened his Lips to the too, too amiable <HI>Aggy,</HI> nor even pre|&s;ented his Hand to lead her out, &s;he de|clined every other Hand that was offered to her. At length, as the Day began to lo&s;e of its Lu&s;tre. Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> whi&s;pered to <HI>Harry,</HI> and reque&s;ted the Favour that he would dance an <HI>Entry.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="154">
The De&s;ire of Father or Uncle was in|&s;tantly, to <HI>Harry,</HI> the &s;ame as the Com|mand of the Grand Signior to his Slave. He ro&s;e, &s;tood forth, and appointed the Air, and began to move with a &s;low and graceful Mea&s;ure. But, as the Notes of the Tune quickened, he quickened his Motions. Ether now appeared to be whol|ly his native Element. No Eye could per|ceive that his Foot conde&s;cended to claim Acquaintance with Earth. He trod Air. He &s;pun around. He &s;oared aloft like a Pyramid of Fire; while his Limbs pre&s;erv|ed the Mea&s;ure, and his Heels traver&s;ed each other, as he &s;hot forward or &s;ideways, with a Quickne&s;s that dazzled the Sight. Till poor <HI>Aggy,</HI> in the Exuberance of her Admiration, very innocently and very inad|vertently exclaimed, Sure, &s;ure, that Girl is not born who can de&s;erve to have him. All to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Happily for <HI>Aggy,</HI> the Company was &s;o intent on the Motions of our Hero, that Few attended to her, &s;ave <HI>Harry</HI> him&s;elf, who hear'd what &s;he &s;aid to the very Bot|tom of his Heart.</P>
<P>But <HI>Aggy,</HI> utterly confounded, at the Recollection of what &s;he had uttered, thought that the Company and the whole World were privy to her Shame. Her
<PB N="156" REF="155">Face, Neck, and Bo&s;om were in&s;tantly &s;uf|fu&s;ed with Crim&s;on; and &s;he did not pre|&s;ume to rai&s;e her Eye to any Face, or any Object, till &s;he gently pulled her elderly Aunt by the Sleeve, and, &s;tealing away, deprived the A&s;&s;embly of its principal Ob|ject and Ornament.</P>
<P>That Night, after Supper, while <HI>Harry</HI> joined with the Company in a Kind of con|&s;trained Chearfulne&s;s, they began to com|pliment him on the Atchievements and Ho|nours of the Day, when <HI>Harry</HI> replied, in evident Di&s;content, No more, no more, my Friends! Indeed, I never &s;o thoroughly de|&s;pi&s;ed and dete&s;ted my&s;elf as I do at this In|&s;tant. And &s;o &s;aying, he ro&s;e ha&s;tily and withdrew to his Chamber.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> &s;oon followed, for he was to lye in the &s;ame Room. And he &s;at down, in Silence, while <HI>Harry</HI> was &s;lowly undre&s;&s;|ing. My dear young Friend, &s;ays he at length, I grieve to &s;ee you indi&s;po&s;ed. In|deed, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> I am not quite as I wi&s;h, and fear I &s;hall di&s;turb you. Ah, my dear Boy, cried <HI>Meekly,</HI> I know your Di&s;order perfectly well. I marked the Ri&s;e and the Progre&s;s, I &s;aw the Whole as plain as <HI>Paul</HI>'s. Had <HI>Aggy Je&s;&s;amin</HI> been indiffe|rent to you, You would have danced and conver&s;ed as familiarly with her as with
<PB N="157" REF="156">any other Wench. But, you dreaded your own Feelings, and you dreaded, &s;till more, that tho&s;e Feelings &s;hould be betrayed to the Ob&s;ervation of Others. I know <HI>Aggy Je&s;&s;amin</HI> and her Father, She is indeed very lovely and very de&s;erving; but yet She is no Mate for you, my <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Ah, Sir, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ince you have al|ready &s;een &s;o far into my Soul, I think I had better open my whole Bo&s;om to you, You will look down upon me, to be &s;ure, you will hold me in the utmo&s;t Contempt, but, no Matter for that, &s;o You promi&s;e not to love me the le&s;s.</P>
<P>Here, I am deemed a mighty clever Fel|low, for&s;ooth, at leaping high Walls, and flinging huge Giants; while alas I am flung, my&s;elf, by the lea&s;t of my own Infirmities, and can no more wre&s;tle again&s;t one of my Pa&s;&s;ions than if Each of them were a <HI>Gre|cian Hercules.</HI></P>
<P>I own to you, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> that I love <HI>Aggy Je&s;&s;amin,</HI> my Heart al&s;o tells me that I &s;hall always love her. What then mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence of my unhappy Affec|tion? Neither my Father nor Uncle will ever approve of our Union, and I would rather pine to Death, than offend the One or the Other.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157">
Should I happen to meet the &s;weet Girl apart, I fear, nay I feel, that I could not be able to re&s;i&s;t the Temptation, and, &s;hould &s;he happen to yield, what a Ruin mu&s;t en&s;ue! If &s;he loved me, it would break the poor Thing's Heart to be for&s;aken, and the Breaking of her's would break my Heart al&s;o. And yet, I could never think of continuing in a criminal Commerce.</P>
<P>Ah, my dear Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> pity the Weakne&s;s of your Friend, and pity the Igno|rance that he is in of his own Spirit. My Heart exulted this very Day in its own Hu|mility, while it felt it&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible to the Acclamations of the Vulgar, and while I reflected that a few Years would &s;oon crip|ple the Performer of &s;uch trifling Exploits, or po&s;&s;ibly render me, in old Age, the ridi|culous Boa&s;ter of the Feats of my Child|hood. But, when the &s;weet Breath of <HI>Aggy</HI> gave its plea&s;ing Applau&s;e to my little Matters, Vanity and Self-e&s;teem &s;unk, with her Approbation, deep into my Bo&s;om, and I have not yet been able to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>O, &s;uch is my Pa&s;&s;ion for her, that, could I get a Di&s;pen&s;ation but for a &s;ingle Tre&s;pa&s;s, I would willingly do, for it, whole Years of hermitical Penance in the Wilderne&s;s. But, what would that avail, my Friend, or how might a whole Eternity
<PB N="159" REF="158">atone for the Seduction of Innocence and Corruption of Virtue?</P>
<P>O, help me then, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> help me to &s;truggle again&s;t my&s;elf; better is it to &s;uffer All that the cruel Conflict may co&s;t me, than to &s;uffer the Stings of that never ending Remor&s;e which would tear my Soul for having injured the Object of my Af|fection.</P>
<P><HI>Meekly</HI> was in Tears, and could not an|&s;wer for &s;ome time.&mdash;Yes&mdash;&s;ays he at length, I will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in this Com|bat, a Combat more glorious than ever was fought by all the <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Alexan|ders</HI> that ever drew Sword. And I will pray to the Captain of our Salvation, in your Behalf; that he may &s;ight the good Fight both in you and for you, and finally crown you with the Wreath of eternal Glory! But then you mu&s;t be ruled, you mu&s;t conform to the Pre&s;criptions of your &s;evere but whole&s;ome Phy&s;ician; in &s;hort, my dear Child, you mu&s;t not &s;ee her any more.&mdash;What, never, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> never &s;ee her any more? That is hard, in|deed:&mdash;It is a nece&s;&s;ary Hard&s;hip; could you an&s;wer to your&s;elf the Con&s;equences of &s;uch an Indulgence?&mdash;I could not, I could not, I confe&s;s it, my Friend.&mdash;I will prevail upon her Father to &s;end her far from you; and I will look out for &s;ome
<PB N="160" REF="159">agreeable and kind hearted Man who may make her a worthy Hu&s;band, and be &s;en&s;i|ble of her Merits.&mdash;</P>
<P>O, you bear too hard upon me, too hard, indeed, cried <HI>Harry.</HI> What, give her to Another? And yet that's an ungenerous Regret; for, why &s;hould I grudge that Happine&s;s to Another which I cannot en|joy? Well then, be it &s;o, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, Mr. <HI>Meekly.</HI> Take her, bear her, tear her away from my Sight, from my Vi|tals! But then &s;he mu&s;t not go empty. Take for her two thou&s;and, three thou|&s;and, five thou&s;and Pounds; &s;he is wel|come, &s;he is welcome to All that I am worth.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Harry</HI> &s;at down and wept, and was accompanied by his Friend. But, the Conflict was now over; and though his Heart was deeply grieved, it was much more at Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The next Morning, at Breakfa&s;t, <HI>Harry</HI> appeared to be quite compo&s;ed. When the Earl, taking a Bundle of Papers from his Pocket, turned, with a fond and conci|liating Air, to Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and &s;aid: My deare&s;t Brother, when You &s;hall be at Lei|&s;ure to ca&s;t your Eye over this Parcel, You will find that I have not been altogether, at lea&s;t not all along, the unnatural Kin&s;man
<PB N="161" REF="160">you had Cau&s;e to apprehend. The&s;e are Copies of the Letters which I &s;ent in &s;earch of You, through &s;everal Parts of Europe, and in which I petitioned you to pardon my pa&s;t Offences, and to return and po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elf of your Rights in the Half of my Fortune and the Whole of my Heart.</P>
<P>Precious Pledges, cried Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> are all Things to me that bring me any In&s;tance of the Affection of &s;o dear a Brother; and &s;o &s;aying he put the Papers into his Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>But tell me, my ever amiable <HI>Harry Clin|ton,</HI> continued the Earl, where in the World could you hide your&s;elf from my Enquiries the&s;e twenty Years pa&s;t? I have got &s;ome &s;cattered Sketches of your Hi&s;tory from Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> and my Son here, and have been burning to learn the Whole, but dreaded to a&s;k you that Favour, le&s;t the Re|collection of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould give You Di&s;tre&s;s. I refu&s;e no Pain to do you a Plea|&s;ure, my Brother.</P>
<P>Here, the honourable Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> began his Story, as formerly recited, and that Night &s;ent his Auditors weeping to Bed.</P>
<P>On the following Morning, when he came to that Part of his Narrative where Lady <HI>Maitland</HI> broke away, he proceeded as followeth.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="161">
Having travelled through &s;everal Parts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> I took <HI>Germany</HI> in my Tour. I &s;taid &s;ome time at <HI>Spa</HI> where I drank the Waters, and within the Year arrived, in perfect Health, at <HI>Rotterdam.</HI></P>
<P>On a Vi&s;it to Mr. <HI>De Wit,</HI> at his Villa near the City, he told me, over our Bot|tle, that he had, at that Time, in his Hou&s;e and in his Guardian&s;hip, one of the mo&s;t extraordinary Women in the Uni|ver&s;e. Though &s;he is now, &s;ays he, advanc|ing toward the Decline of Life, &s;he is by far the mo&s;t fini&s;hed Female I ever beheld, while all &s;he &s;ays, and all &s;he does, give a Grace to her Per&s;on that is quite indi&s;criba|ble. She has a Youth too, her Son, with her, who is nearly as great a Rarity as her|&s;elf; and, were it not that his Complexion is &s;allow, and that he is &s;omething &s;hort of a Leg, and Blind of one Eye, he would po&s;itively be the mo&s;t lovely of all the hu|man Species.</P>
<P>You put me in mind, &s;aid I laughing, of the <HI>Barratarian</HI> Wench, who was com|mended, to Governor <HI>Sancho,</HI> as the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Beauty within a League, with this Exception only, that one Eye was blind, and that the Other ran with Brim&s;tone and Vermilion. But pray who are the&s;e Won|ders?</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="162">
That, &s;aid he, I either cannot or mu&s;t not declare. They are evidently People of the fir&s;t Fa&s;hion, and mu&s;t have &s;ome uncommon Rea&s;ons for their pre&s;ent Con|duct, as they live quite retired and admit of no Company.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, &s;aid I, you have rai&s;ed my Curio&s;ity in Earne&s;t; is there no managing &s;o as to procure me a &s;hort <HI>t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te</HI> with 'em? I wi&s;h there was, &s;ays he, for I long to know how far your Sentiments agree with mine in this Matter. Ye&s;terday the Lady told me that &s;he intended to go and re&s;ide &s;ome Time in <HI>England,</HI> and that I would oblige her by getting a Per&s;on, duely qua|lified, to initiate her and her Son in the Language of the Country. And now, if &s;uch a fine Gentleman could conde&s;cend to undre&s;s him&s;elf, you might come To-mor|row, as a Per&s;on who wanted Hire, and I might introduce you to an Interview by the way of treating, provided you are up|on Honour not to reveal any thing con|cerning them or their Place of Abode</P>
<P>The next Morning I waited on Mr. <HI>De Wit,</HI> under the Appearance of a reduced Gentleman, a Character that excites a Mixture of Contempt and Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="163">
The Lady received and &s;poke to me with that dignified Complacence, which awes while it engages, and, while it attracts, forbids an irreverent Familiarity. She was, indeed, every thing that my Friend had boa&s;ted of her; for though her Per&s;on was all Maje&s;ty, her Manner was all Grace. Will you an&s;wer for the Di&s;cretion of this young Man, Mr. <HI>De Wit?</HI> I will, Madam, &s;ays he. I bowed to them both.</P>
<P>On turning, I perceived that her Son eyed me with much Attention, and I, on my Part, &s;urveyed him with the utmo&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment. He laboured indeed, ap|parently, under all the Di&s;advantages that my Friend de&s;cribed; but Enchantment lurked in his Accents and in the dimpling of his Lips; and, when he &s;miled, Heaven it&s;elf was infu&s;ed through the fine Round|ings of his Olive-coloured Countenance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I felt &s;uch a &s;udden Attachment to the&s;e extraordinary Per&s;onages, that I re|&s;olved to keep on the Deception, at lea&s;t for a few Days, and accordingly engaged with them at a &s;tated Salary</P>
<P>I entered on my Province. My young Pupil, e&s;pecially, began to improve apace. And, as I was particularly cautious of ob|&s;erving the di&s;tant Re&s;pect that &s;uited my
<PB N="165" REF="164">Station, I grew into great Favour both with Mother and Son.</P>
<P>How long, Mr. <HI>De Wit,</HI> would &s;ay, do you propo&s;e to carry on this Farce? Till I can prevail upon them, I an&s;wered, to accompany me to <HI>England.</HI> For I feel my Affections &s;o tied to them that I cannot think of parting.</P>
<P>On a Day as I &s;at with my Pupil in his Apartment, he happened to let his Book fall, and, as I &s;tooped to take it up, the Picture of my <HI>Matilda,</HI> that was richly enamelled, and &s;et with Brilliants, to a great Value, &s;uddenly loo&s;ed from its Rib|band, and dropped thro' the Bo&s;om of my Shirt upon the Floor.</P>
<P>I &s;tood concerned and greatly aba&s;hed by this Accident, but my Pupil, &s;till more alarmed, &s;tarted up and, catching at it, gazed upon it inten&s;ely. Ha, my Friend, &s;aid he, I doubt you are an Impo&s;tor. The Proprietor of this Jewel would never &s;et him&s;elf out to hire without &s;ome &s;ini&s;|ter De&s;ign. Who, Sir, and what are you?</P>
<P>I own, &s;aid I, my &s;weet Fellow, that I am not what I &s;eem, I am of noble De|lcent, and of Riches &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e
<PB N="166" REF="165">a Principality. &mdash; And what then could induce you to impo&s;e upon us as you have done? &mdash; Curio&s;ity at fir&s;t, and then the &s;trong Inclination which I took both to you and your Mother at our fir&s;t Inter|view; neither did I propo&s;e to reveal my|&s;elf till we &s;hould reach my native Coun|try, where all Sorts of Honours and Af|fluence attend you. &mdash; Tell me then, &s;aid he, who&s;e Picture is this, a very love|ly One indeed; is this the Face, Sir, of your Mi&s;tre&s;s or your Wife? (looking very inqui&s;itively at me.) Ah, &s;aid I, &s;he was once Mi&s;tre&s;s of thou&s;ands of Hearts, No|bles waited before her Drawing Room, and Dukes near her Toilet. She was once al&s;o my Wife: But the dear Saint is now eternally ble&s;&s;ed in a more &s;uitable Bride|groom.</P>
<P>Will you indulge me, Sir, &s;aid he, with the Story of your Loves? It may atone in great Mea&s;ure for your late Deception which, however well meant, was very a|larming.</P>
<P>Here I related to him the &s;hort pathetic Hi&s;tory that I told you of my <HI>Matilda,</HI> with which he was &s;o affected and in &s;uch violent Agitation, that I was quite affright|ed for him and &s;topped &s;everal Times, but he in&s;i&s;ted on my proceeding.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="166">
Ah, &s;aid he, when I concluded, &s;hould I ever be con&s;orted in the Manner that you and your <HI>Matty</HI> were, how ble&s;&s;ed I &s;hall think my&s;elf! I have, &s;ays I, a little Cou&s;in in <HI>England,</HI> perhaps the lovelie&s;t Child in the World, and if you will marry her, when you Both come to proper Years, I will &s;ettle ten Million of <HI>French</HI> Money upon you. Mean Time I be&s;eech you to &s;ay nothing to your Mamma of what has pa&s;&s;ed. I will not, &s;aid he, unle&s;s I &s;ee a di&s;cretionary Nece&s;&s;ity for it.</P>
<P>That Night, I went to the City to &s;ettle the Affairs of my Hou&s;hold. On my Re|turn next Morning, I met Mr. <HI>De Wit</HI> at the Gate of his Court. Ah, my Friend, &s;aid he, our amiable Gue&s;ts are departed. Gone, I cried, gone! which Way, where to, I pray you? That al&s;o is a Secret, &s;aid he, which I am not permited to tell you. Late in the Evening there arrived a Reti|nue of about twenty Servants, &s;trongly armed and mounted, with a flying Chai&s;e and &s;ix Hor&s;es, and a Packet of Letters. The Lady did not go to Bed, but ordered all Things to be in Readine&s;s for their De|parture again&s;t the Ri&s;ing of the Moon, When they were near &s;etting out, and go|ing to bid me adieu, Have you no Com|mands, Madam, &s;aid I, for the good young
<PB N="168" REF="167">Man your Tutor? Not a Penny, &s;ays &s;he, I can't afford Wages equivalent to Ser|vants of his Quality. How, Madam, &s;aid I, is my Friend then detected? But, it was a very innocent and friendly Fraud I a&s;&s;ure you; I &s;hould not have impo&s;ed him upon your Lady&s;hip, did I not know you to be &s;afer in his honourable Hands than in tho&s;e of any Other.</P>
<P>I then gave them an Account of your Family, your va&s;t Fortune, nor was I quite &s;ilent as to your Merits, my dear <HI>Harry;</HI> and I added, that I was &s;en&s;ible you would be deeply afflicted at the De|parture of Per&s;ons to whom you were &s;o &s;trongly attached. There is no Help for it, replied my Lady, we have Rea&s;ons of ut|mo&s;t Import for not di&s;clo&s;ing our&s;elves to him. Tell him, however, that we e&s;teem him highly &mdash; affect him tenderly &mdash; &s;hall think of him &mdash; &s;hall pray for him &mdash; and &mdash; and &mdash; la&s;tly &mdash; that you &s;aw us drop a grateful Tear to his Remembrance.</P>
<P>As I could extort no further Intelligence from my Friend, Mr. <HI>De Wit,</HI> I parted in a half Kind of Chagrin, and prepared to pur&s;ue my Fugitives, though I knew not what Road to take, nor where to turn me for the Purpo&s;e. At all Adventures, how|ever, I &s;et out on the Way to <HI>France,</HI> as
<PB N="169" REF="168">they appeared to be of that Country, as well by the Elegance of their Manners, as by their Fluency in the Language.</P>
<P>I was attended by eleven of as brave and faithful Fellows as ever thru&s;t them&s;elves between their Ma&s;ter and Danger.</P>
<P>On the fifth or &s;ixth Day, as we got on the Borders of <HI>French Flanders,</HI> in an open and de&s;olate Way, with a Fore&s;t far on the left, a Man rode toward us on the Spur, and approaching cried out, Help, Gentlemen, for Heaven's Sake, help to re&s;cue my dear Ladies, who are plundered and carried away by the Banditti. They have already killed twenty of my Compa|nions, and I alone am left to cry out for Relief &mdash; I bid him lead, and we fol|lowed!</P>
<P>In a few Minutes we came where we &s;aw a great Number of the Dead and dy|ing, covering the Sand and thin Herbage. But our Leader cried out, Stop not here, my noble Friends! Yonder they are, yon|der they are, they have but ju&s;t taken a|way all our Hor&s;es, Luggage, and Coach, and are now at the Plunder. I am weak thro' Lo&s;s of Blood, but will help you the be&s;t I may.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="169">
Here he &s;purred again toward the Ene|my, but his Hor&s;e would not an&s;wer his Courage. I then looked about to ob&s;erve if any Advantage could be taken; for I perceived that the Ruffians were &s;till very numerous, about Thirty who had &s;urvived the late Combat; but, &s;eeing that the Country was quite open, and that we had nothing but Re&s;olution and our God to help us, I commended my&s;elf to him in &s;o good a Cau&s;e, and, putting my Hor&s;e to Speed, I rode full at the Foe, confident of being well and gallantly &s;econded.</P>
<P>When the Banditti perceived us, they in&s;tantly quitted the Plunder, and gather|ing into a Group, they prepared their Ca|rabines, and di&s;charged them full at us as we drew near.</P>
<P>As I happened to be foremo&s;t I received the greate&s;t Damage. One of their Balls gave me this Mark in my Neck; Another pa&s;&s;ed through the Fle&s;h of my left Shoul|der; and Another through my Hat, and left this Scar in my Head.</P>
<P>But, when we came in upon them, as the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;ay, <HI>comminus en&s;e,</HI> Hand to Hand, had they doubled their Numbers, they would have been as nothing to us. My faithful <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> levelled Half a Score
<PB N="171" REF="170">of them with his own Hand, and in le&s;s than three Minutes we had no Opponent in the Field. I then rode up to the Coach and perceived two Ladies in it, pale as Death, and &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the Bottom.</P>
<P>Immediately I ordered <HI>James,</HI> my Sur|geon's Mate, to take a little Blood from them, and, on their Recovery, to follow me, with all my People, and all the Hor&s;es, Baggage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the neare&s;t Inn. Then, feeling my Wounds begin to &s;mart, I took my Surgeon with me and gallopped away.</P>
<P>In about a League, we came to a large Hou&s;e of Entertainment, and, finding my|&s;elf &s;ick and qualmi&s;h, through the great Effu&s;ion of Blood, I had my Wounds di|rectly dre&s;&s;ed and, taking a Draught of Wine Whey, got into a warm Bed.</P>
<P>After a Night of unea&s;y Slumbers the Curtain of my Bed was gently drawn a&s;ide, and awaking, I heard a Voice &s;ay, in &s;oft Mu&s;ic, Ah, my dear Mamma, it is he, it is he him&s;elf!</P>
<P>On lifting my feeble Eyes, I perceived a Vi&s;ion at my Side, of a female Appear|ance, but more wonderful and more lovely than any thing I had ever conceived of the
<PB N="172" REF="171">Inhabitants in Bli&s;s. Her Eyes &s;wam in Glory, and her whole Form &s;eemed a Con|den&s;ing or Sub&s;tantiation of Harmony and Light.</P>
<P>While I gazed in &s;ilent A&s;toni&s;hment, I heard another Voice &s;ay, Don't you know us, my Son, my dear Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> don't you remember your Pupils, don't you remember your blind, lame and tawny <HI>Lewis?</HI> he is now turned into that pa&s;&s;able Girl there, who&s;e Honour and who&s;e Life you Ye&s;terday pre&s;erved at the great Peril of your own.</P>
<P>Here, &s;eizing her Hand, I pre&s;&s;ed it to my Lips and cried, Am I then &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, my honoured Madam, as to have done &s;ome Service to the two deare&s;t Objects of my Heart's fixed Affections? Soft, &s;ays &s;he, none of the&s;e Tran&s;ports, your Sur|geon tells us that Repo&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary for you. Mean time we will go and prepare the be&s;t Regimen that the Place can afford for your Nouri&s;hment. And, after that, I will &s;end a Di&s;patch to my Lord, and let him know how far, how very deeply He, and we, and all his Hou&s;e are indebted to you.</P>
<P>For that Day, and the following Week, as my Fever grew &s;omething high, I &s;aw no more of the Daughter, and the Mo|ther
<PB N="173" REF="172">&s;taid no longer than to admini&s;ter &s;omething to me, or barely to enquire how I was. At length I got a Cool and began to recover, when the former Vi&s;ion de|&s;cended upon my ravi&s;hed Sen&s;es, the vi|&s;ion of that <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> the Sight of whom never failed to bring Cheer to the Eyes and Delight to the Hearts of all Beholders.</P>
<P>They &s;at down by my Side, and my Lady, taking my Hand and looking ten|derly at me, what would you think, &s;aid &s;he &s;miling, of my <HI>Louy</HI> for a Wife? Ah, Madam, I exclaimed, She would be too much of Bli&s;s, too precious, too glorious, too overpowering for the Heart and Sen&s;es of any Mortal. Don't tell me, cries my Lady, in my Eyes, my <HI>Harry,</HI> you are full as amiable for a Hu&s;band as &s;he can be for a Wife. Be&s;ide, you have earned her, my Son, &s;he is your own dear Purcha&s;e, by a Service of infinite Value, and at the Price of your precious Blood. She has told me the Story of your fir&s;t Love, and the Recollection of it never fails to bring Tears from my Eyes. But I mu&s;t, here|after, hear the Whole from your own Mouth, with all your other Adventures, the &s;malle&s;t Incident will be very intere&s;t|ing to me, I a&s;&s;ure you. O, my dear, my &s;weet Fellow, you are to a Hair the very Man I wi&s;h for my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> the brave, the tender, gentle and generous Heart; ju&s;t
<PB N="174" REF="173">the Thing I would have wi&s;hed for my&s;elf, when I was at the Age of my <HI>Louy.</HI></P>
<P>But, my deare&s;t, my honoured Madam, loved and honoured next to Heaven, you have not yet told me how your <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> is inclined. Whereupon, the bewitching Creature, archly &s;miling, and blu&s;hing, and reaching forth a poli&s;hed Hand of liv|ing Alaba&s;ter, Here, &s;he cried, I pre&s;ent you with this Trifle, in Token that I don't hate you&mdash;very much.</P>
<P>My <HI>Clinton,</HI> &s;aid my Lady, I have &s;ent off my favourite Servant <HI>Gerard,</HI> with my Di&s;patches to my Lord. He is the only One that remains of all my Retinue. Your Surgeon has dre&s;&s;ed his Wound, and pro|nounces it &s;o &s;light as not to incommode him in his Journey. I cho&s;e him more particularly for the Carrier of my Purpo&s;es, as he was the Witne&s;s of your Valour, as he can te&s;tify to my Lord with what Intre|pidity you ru&s;hed foremo&s;t, into the Thick of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and with what unexam|pled Bravery you defeated, in a &s;hort Time, a Body of four or five times your Number. The&s;e Things, I tru&s;t, will have their due Weight; for, though my Lord is of a lofty and inflexible Nature, he is yet alive to the Feelings of Honour and Ju&s;tice, &s;o that our Affairs have a hopeful and au&s;pi|cious
<PB N="175" REF="174">A&s;pect. But, you are a little flu&s;hed, my Child; we will not encroach further upon you till To-morrow.</P>
<P>During the three following Weeks, though confined to my Bed, I was per|mitted to &s;it up, and my Wounds, though not &s;kinned, were healing apace. What Happine&s;s did I enjoy during that ec&s;tatic Interval! the maternal and filial Angels &s;carce ever left my Side. One Morning, when I ju&s;t awoke from a terrifying Dream, they both entered with Peace and Comfort and Healing in their Countenances.</P>
<P>What is the Matter, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid my Lady, your Face does not &s;eem com|po&s;ed to that Fortitude and Complacence which is &s;eated in your Heart. Ah, Ma|dam, I cried, I have been all Night tor|mented with the mo&s;t alarming and horri|ble Vi&s;ions I ever had in my Life. Three times I dreamed, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, that my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and I were walking Hand in Hand, through the Fields of <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> or on the Banks of <HI>Meander,</HI> or in the Gardens of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> gazing and drinking in large Draughts of Love from Each Other: when at one Time a huge and tremendous Dra|gon, and again a &s;udden Earthquake, and again an impetuous Hurricane came, and caught, and &s;evered us far a&s;under.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="175">
But my Vi&s;ions, my hone&s;t Friend, &s;aid the heavenly &s;miling <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> have been of a very different Nature. I dreamed that, while we were &s;tanding on the Brink of a frightful Precipice together, your <HI>Matilda</HI> de&s;cended, all cele&s;tial, and a thou&s;and Times more lovely than &s;he appears in the lovely Portrait that you carry about you. At fir&s;t I feared that &s;he came to reclaim you to her&s;elf; but, in&s;tead of that, &s;he &s;miled upon me and began to care&s;s me, and taking my right Hand &s;he put it into Yours. Then, a&s;cending in her Bright|ne&s;s, &s;he hovered awhile on high, and ca&s;ting down upon me a Look of fixed Love, &s;he gave me a Beck with her Hand, as it were to follow, and was immediately lo&s;t in Glory.</P>
<P>O, my dear Children, cried the Mar|chione&s;s (for &s;uch &s;he was) might I but once &s;ee ye united, how I &s;hould lift my Head! or rather how &s;atisfied I &s;hould be to lay it down in Peace, having nothing further to care for on this Side of Eternity.</P>
<P>That Night I &s;lept &s;ounder than u&s;ual, and did not awake till the Day was &s;ome|thing advanced. On opening the Curtain, I &s;aw <HI>James</HI> &s;eated in a moody Po&s;ture by the Side of my Bed. How are the Ladies, <HI>James?</HI> &s;aid I. Gone, Sir. Gone, gone! I
<PB N="177" REF="176">cried out. Yes, Sir, gone indeed, but with very heavy Hearts, and Both of them drowned in Tears. Here has been a large Body of the <HI>Gens d'Armes</HI> &s;ent for them, &s;o that there was no re&s;i&s;ting. Poor <HI>Gerard</HI> went on his Knees to his Lady, to beg Per|mi&s;&s;ion to throw him&s;elf at your honoured Feet, as he &s;aid, and to bid you adieu, but She would not allow him. Mean time, &s;he charged me with this Watch and Ring, and this Letter for your Honour.</P>
<P>I catched at the Letter and, tearing it open, read over and over, a thou&s;and Times, what will for ever be engraven in my Me|mory and on my Heart.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>WE leave you, we leave you, mo&s;t Beloved of Men, and we are mi&s;erable in &s;o doing, but alas we are not our own Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es. My Lord, for this Time, has proved unju&s;t and ungrateful; and refu&s;es your <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> as well to my Prayers; as to your infinite Merits. He has affianced her, as it &s;eems, to a Prince of the Blood, and his Ambition has blinded him to all other Con&s;iderations. Be not yet in De&s;|pair, we &s;hall exert our very utmo&s;t to get this injurious Sentence rever&s;ed; and if your <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> inherits my Blood or Spirit, not all the Engines in <HI>France</HI> will ever com|pel her to give her Hand to Another. In

<P>Yes, I cried, ye precious Relicks, ye de|licious Memorandums, to my Lips, to my Heart! Be ye the Companions of my Soli|rude, the Con&s;olers of my Affliction! &s;ooner &s;hall this Arm be torn off, and Time it&s;elf pa&s;s away, than One or the Other &s;hall be divided from my Cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>Ah, how u&s;ele&s;s are Admonitions to the Impatience of a Lover! Fervent Love can know no Fears. I was no &s;ooner able to &s;it my Hor&s;e than I &s;et off directly for <HI>Paris,</HI> with this Precaution only, that my People
<PB N="179" REF="178">would call me by my Mother's maiden Name of <HI>Goodall.</HI></P>
<P>As we knew not the Names or Titles of tho&s;e after whom we were in &s;earch, our Eyes became our only Inqui&s;itors, and we daily ranged the Town, poreing into every Carriage of Di&s;tinction for a Sight of the Mother or Daughter; and even prying among the Lacqueys and Liveries for the Face of our Friend <HI>Gerard.</HI></P>
<P>On a Day, as my valiant <HI>Tirlah</HI> and I rode a broad, reconnoitring the Suburbs, we hear'd a Noi&s;e and a Shout of Di&s;tre&s;s that i&s;&s;ued from a di&s;tant Farm-Hou&s;e; and, as we ha&s;tened up, the Tumult grew louder, and the Cry of Help! and Murder! was &s;e|veral Times repeated.</P>
<P>We in&s;tantly knocked at the Door, but were refu&s;ed Admittance; when <HI>Tirlah,</HI> alighting, ran again&s;t it and, breaking through Bars and all with his Foot, threw the Door off its Hinges.</P>
<P>On entring, we &s;aw a Man &s;tretched on the Broad of his Back in the Floor, with four Others about him, who were going to u&s;e him very barbarou&s;ly. Stay your Hands, I cried, I will &s;hoot the fir&s;t Man through the Head who &s;hall dare to proceed in this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="179">
Why Sir, &s;aid a young Fellow, ri&s;ing, this Man wanted to be gracious with my pretty young Wife, I caught him in the very Attempt, and &s;o I think it but fair and hone&s;t to &s;poil him at &s;uch Sport for Time to come. Ay but, &s;aid I, you might mur|der him, and I can't &s;uffer that. Come, my Friend, no Harm appears to be done as yet, and if he pays a hand&s;ome Penance for the Wickedne&s;s of his Intention, I would advi&s;e you to pa&s;s Matters over for the pre&s;ent. Say, how much do you de|mand? Five hundred Louis d'Ors, &s;aid the Fellow; if he pays that, he &s;hall be quit for this Turn.</P>
<P>Five hundred Louis d'Ors! I exclaimed; why, all the Clothes on his Back are not worth the hundredth Part of the Sum. True, Ma&s;ter, &s;aid the Pea&s;ant, winking, but his Pockets may happen to be richer than his Clothes. Well, &s;aid I, if he &s;e|cures you in Half the Sum, I think you may be &s;atisfied. Why, Ma&s;ter, &s;ince you have &s;aid it, I will not go back. Where|upon the a&s;toni&s;hed Pri&s;oner was permitted to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay, you &s;ad Man you, are you willing to pay this Fellow the Sum I agreed for, in Compen&s;ation of the Injury
<PB N="181" REF="180">you attempted to do him? I am, Sir, &s;aid he, with many Thanks for your Mediati|on. Then, ha&s;tily putting his Hand to his Pocket, he took out a Note on the Cu&s;toms which, with &s;ome &s;mall Matter of Ca&s;h, made up the Money, and we departed the Hou&s;e together.</P>
<P>As I was ju&s;t going to mount, he came up and acco&s;ted me with Elegance and Dignity. Sir, &s;aid he, You have made me your Debtor, beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, beyond the Power of Princes to pay. Be plea&s;ed however to accept the little I have about me, here are five thou&s;and <HI>Louis,</HI> in this little Note-Book. Not a Penny, Sir, in|deed, I am by no Means in want. You mu&s;t not refu&s;e, &s;aid he, &s;ome Token of my Acknowledgment, here is a Stone valu|ed at double the Sum I offer'd you. Then, taking from a Pocket the Diamond Button of his Hat, he pre&s;ented it to me. You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Sir, &s;aid I, I can accept of no Con&s;ideration for doing an Action of Humanity, and I rejoice to have pre&s;erved a Per&s;on of your Di&s;tinction and Genero&s;i|ty. I then turned my Hor&s;e, and, tho' he called after me, I rode away, being neither de&s;irous of knowing or being known.</P>
<P>My Re&s;earches hitherto being altogether fruitle&s;s, I imagined I might, with better
<PB N="182" REF="181">Likelihood, meet my Beloved, in the pub|lic Walks, public Theatres, or Rooms of di&s;tingui&s;hed Re&s;ort.</P>
<P>One Night, as I &s;at alone in a &s;ide Box at the Opera, intently gazing and hungering around for &s;ome Similitude of my <HI>Loui&s;a;</HI> there entered One of the lovelie&s;t young Fellows I ever beheld. He carele&s;ly threw him&s;elf be&s;ide me, looked around; with|drew his Eyes; and then looked at me with &s;uch a long and piercing Inqui&s;ition as alarm|ed me, and gave me Cau&s;e to think I was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>French</HI> &s;eldom he&s;itate, he &s;eemed at once backward and de&s;irous of acco&s;ting me. At length he entered upon Conver&s;e touching the Drama and the Mu&s;ic, and &s;poke with Judgment and Ele|gance &s;uperior to the Matter; while I an|&s;wer'd him with due Complacence, but in a Manner that partook of that Regard|le&s;ne&s;s for Trifles which then &s;at at my Heart.</P>
<P>Between the Acts, he turned and ca&s;t his Eye &s;uddenly on me. Sir, &s;ays he, do you believe that there is &s;uch a Thing as Sympathy? Occa&s;ionally, Sir, I think it may have its Effect, though I can't credit all the Wonders that are reported of it. I am &s;orry for that, &s;aid he, as I ardently
<PB N="183" REF="182">wi&s;h that your Feelings were the &s;ame as mine at this In&s;tant. I never &s;aw you be|fore, Sir, I have no Knowledge of you, and yet I declare that, were I to choo&s;e an Advocate in Love, a Second in Combat, or a Friend in Extremity, You, You are the very Man upon whom I would pitch.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered not, but &s;eized his Hand and pre&s;&s;ed it to my Bo&s;om. I conceive, Sir, continued he, notwith&s;tanding your Fluency in the Language, that you are not a Na|tive. My Name is <HI>D'Aubigny,</HI> I live at &s;uch a Place, and, if you will do me the Plea&s;ure of a &s;ingle Vi&s;it, all the Honours, Re&s;pects, and Services, that our Hou&s;e can confer, &s;hall be yours without Re&s;erve. Sir, &s;aid I, I am of <HI>England,</HI> my Name is <HI>Goodall,</HI> and as &s;oon as a certain Affair allows me to admit of any Acquaintance in <HI>Paris,</HI> You &s;hall be the fir&s;t Elected of my Arms and my Heart.</P>
<P>In a few Nights after, as <HI>Tirlah</HI> and I were turning a Corner of the <HI>Rue de St. Jaques,</HI> we &s;aw three Men, with their Backs to the Wall, attacked by nearly three times their Number. We did not he&s;itate a Moment what Part to take. At the fir&s;t Pa&s;s, I ran one of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins through the Body; <HI>Tirlah</HI> levelled Two more with his oaken Staff, and the re&s;t took to Flight.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="183">
Gentlemen, &s;aid One of the Three, I thank you for this brave and &s;ea&s;onable A&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;<HI>Roche,</HI> run for a Surgeon, I am wounded, I doubt, dangerou&s;ly.&mdash;<HI>Pierre,</HI> lend me your Arm&mdash;Come, Gentlemen, we have but a little Way to my Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Though the Night was too dark for ex|amining Features, I thought that the Voice was not quite unknown to me. Within a few Minutes we arrived at a Palace that re|tired, inward, from the Hou&s;es that were ranged on either Hand On pulling the Hanger of a Bell, the great Door opened upon a &s;umptuous Hall, which led to a Parlour, enlightened by a &s;ilver Sconce that hung from the Vaulting.</P>
<P>As we enter'd, the Ma&s;ter turned &s;hort upon me, and looking full in my Face, and &s;tarting and lifting his Hands in Sur|pri&s;e, Great Ruler of Events! he cried, the very Man I wi&s;hed my Brother and Com|panion thro' Life, and this is the very Man You have &s;ent to my Re&s;cue!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then the Surgeon arrived, and I hear'd him ha&s;tily a&s;king where the Mar|quis was. On entering, he &s;aid, I'm &s;orry for your Misfortune, my Lord, but Mat|ters may be better than we apprehend.
<PB N="185" REF="184">And immediately he took out his Ca&s;e of In&s;truments. One of the Ruffians, &s;aid the Marquis, before I was aware, came behind and ran me through the Back.</P>
<P>The Surgeon then tipt open his Lord|&s;hip's Wa&s;tecoat, and changed Colour on &s;eeing his Shirt drenched in Blood. But, getting him quickly undre&s;&s;ed, and having probed his Wound, he &s;truck his Hands together and cried, Courage, my Friends! it is only a Fle&s;h-bu&s;ine&s;s, the Weapon has pa&s;&s;ed clear of the Ribs and Vitals.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Marquis's Wound was dre&s;&s;ed, and that we had got him to Bed, I fancy, Sir, &s;aid I to the Surgeon, I may have &s;ome &s;mall Occa&s;ion for a Ca&s;t of your Office, I feel a little Smart in my Sword Arm.</P>
<P>On &s;tripping, he found that a chance Thru&s;t had entered about Half an Inch into the Mu&s;cle above my Elbow, and had ripped up &s;ome of the Skin. But, he quick|ly applied the proper Dre&s;&s;ing, and I was preparing to take my Leave, when the Marquis cried out, You mu&s;t not think of parting, my dear Friend; You are the Ma&s;ter of the Ma&s;ter here, and Lord of this Hou&s;e and of All that is in it.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="185">
The Surgeon then ordered his Lord&s;hip to compo&s;e him&s;elf as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and, having wi&s;hed him a good Night, I &s;ent <HI>Tirlah</HI> to my Lodgings to let my People know that I was well and in friendly Hands. I was then conducted by the Dome&s;tics to a &s;uperb Apartment, where a Bed was pre|pared, and where a &s;mall Supper of Ele|gancies lay fuming on the Sideboard.</P>
<P>Having &s;wallowed a few Bits, with a Gla&s;s or two of Wine, I ro&s;e and &s;auntered through the Room, mu&s;ing on my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> heavily &s;ighing, and nearly de&s;pairing of being ever able to find her.</P>
<P>Some time after, I &s;at down, to undre&s;s and get to Bed, when a Number of the Officers of Ju&s;tice &s;ilently entered my Cham|ber, &s;eiz'd my Sword that I had put off, and coming whi&s;peringly to me, command|ed me to accompany them, without mak|ing any Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;aw that it was Madne&s;s to re&s;i&s;t, and, as I went with them, I ob&s;erved that two of the Family Liveries had joined them|&s;elves to the Officers. It then in&s;tantly oc|curred that I was in the Hou&s;e of my Rival; that the Marquis was the very Per&s;on to whom my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> had been de&s;tined; that I was &s;omehow di&s;covered; and that they
<PB N="187" REF="186">were conducting me to the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> of which I had hear'd as many affrighting Stories as are u&s;ually told of the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Ah, Traitor, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, is it thus you &s;erve the Man who but now &s;aved your Life at the Expence of his own Blood? Let no One hereafter tru&s;t to the bleating of the Lamb or the courting of the Turtle; the roaring of the Lion, and the Pounces of the Vulture, may thus deceitfully lurk under the One and the Other.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome Streets, they took me to a large Hou&s;e, where dwelt One of their chief Magi&s;trates, being al&s;o a Member of their Parliament. Having knocked re|&s;pectfully at the Gate and waited &s;ome Time, at length we were admitted, and they took me to a kind of Lobby, where we &s;taid, while One of the Po&s;&s;e went to advi&s;e the Ju&s;ticiary of my Attendance. At length he returned and, acco&s;ting me in a Tone of &s;urly and di&s;couraging Autho|rity, Friend, &s;ays he, my Lord is engaged and not at Lei&s;ure to Night; To-morrow, perhaps, he may hear what you have to plead in your own Defence. So &s;aying, he and his Fellows thru&s;t me into a wa&s;te Room, and locked and chained the Door upon me, and, laughing, bid me to warm or cool my Heels at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="187">
Fool, Fool that I was, &s;aid I, to quit the Side of my brave and faithful Compa|nions, how quickly &s;hould we have di&s;|comfited this Magi&s;trate and all his Ho&s;t! but I mu&s;t be a Knight Adventurer for|&s;ooth, and draw my Sword in the Defence of every Scoundrel who goes the Street.</P>
<P>I then went and felt the Windows, to try if I could force a Pa&s;&s;age for making my E&s;cape; but, finding that all were grated with &s;trong and impa&s;&s;able Bars of Iron; O, I cried, that this Marquis, this ungrateful <HI>D'Aubigny</HI> were now in his fuil|e&s;t Strength and oppo&s;ed to me, Point to Point, that I might reclaim from him, in an In&s;tant, the Life I have given!</P>
<P>I then traver&s;ed the Room with an in|con&s;i&s;tent Pace, now ra&s;hly re&s;olving on furious Events; and again more &s;edately deliberating on what I had to do. Till, having ruminated thus for the Remainder of the Night, I at la&s;t became more at Ea&s;e, and re&s;igned my&s;elf to the Di&s;pen|&s;ations of All-di&s;po&s;ing Providence, though, I confe&s;s, with a gloomy and reluctant Kind of Content.</P>
<P>When the Day appeared and was &s;omething advanced, I hear'd my Door
<PB N="189" REF="188">unlocking and the Chain taking away, and I concluded that they came to &s;ummon me to my Tryal. But, in&s;tead of the Offi|cers of Ju&s;tice, I &s;aw near twenty Men in the Marquis's Livery, who &s;ilently bowed down before me, and re&s;pectfully &s;hewed me, with their Hand, the Way out of my Pri&s;on. I followed them al&s;o in Silence, and getting into the Street, I wi&s;hed to know if I was really free, and turned from them down the Way that led to my Lodgings; whereupon they ca&s;t them&s;elves before me, and, in a &s;upplicating Po&s;ture, be&s;ought me to go with them.</P>
<P>Finding then that I was &s;till their Pri&s;o|ner, I gave a longing Look out for my valiant Fellows; but, as they did not ap|pear, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be reconducted to the Marquis's Palace, and followed my ob&s;equious Commanders into the proud Apartment, to which they had led me the preceding Night, and where, bowing to the Ground, they all left me and retired.</P>
<P>As I had been much fatigued in Body and Mind, I threw my&s;elf on the Bed, leaving Events to their I&s;&s;ues, and fell into a Kind of &s;tarting and intermitting Slum|ber, when I heard a Voice, at my Side, &s;hout out, in once loved Accents, O, my deare&s;t Mamma, it is He, indeed, 'tis he, it is he him&s;elf!</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="189">
On this I awoke, and rouzed my&s;elf, and lifting my languid Eyes, and fixing them on the Object that &s;tood before me; and are you then, I cried, are you al&s;o, <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> in the Confederacy again&s;t me?&mdash;Say nothing, you are not the <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> I once knew.&mdash;I will ari&s;e, I will go forth, not all your Gates and Bars and Bolts &s;hall hold me, I will tear my Body and my Soul too, if po&s;&s;ible, from you for ever!&mdash;Go to your Betrothed, to your Beloved! and leave me to peri&s;h, it is a Matter of no Import&mdash;I am yet plea&s;ed that I &s;aved your Cho&s;en; as it may one Day &s;erve to reproach you with the Merits of the Man whom he has &s;o unworthily treated!</P>
<P>I could no more. A long Silence on all Sides en&s;ued, &s;ave the Language that was uttered by Heavings and Sobbings. When the Marchione&s;s, coming and ca&s;ting her|&s;elf on her Knees by my Bed; you have Rea&s;on, Sir, &s;he exclaimed, you have Rea|&s;on to reproach and to dete&s;t every Branch of our ungrateful Family for ever! you &s;aved my&s;elf, you &s;aved my Daughter, and yet the Father and the Hu&s;band proved aver&s;e to your De&s;ervings, and turned your Benefits into Poi&s;on. You have now &s;aved our Son, the only One who can convey our Name to Po&s;terity, and yet,
<PB N="191" REF="190">from the Beginning, you have received nothing in Return, &s;ave Wounds, Pains and Sickne&s;s, Lo&s;&s;es, Damages and Di&s;ap|pointments, and, at this very Day, the mo&s;t ignominious U&s;age, where you merited end|le&s;s Thanks and everla&s;ting Renown. Blame my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> then, and me, but blame not my Son, Sir, for the&s;e unworthy Events; he is quite innocent of them, he is &s;hocked and di&s;tracted by them; he re&s;pects and loves you more than ever <HI>Jonathan</HI> loved the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e.</HI> But he will not, he dare not &s;ee you, till we have, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, made his Peace.</P>
<P>How, Madam! I cried,&mdash;but, no more of that Po&s;ture, it pains me pa&s;t bearing&mdash;Is it a Fact, can it be po&s;&s;i|ble that the Marquis <HI>D'aubigny</HI> &s;hould be your Son? Is he not of the Blood royal, the very Rival whom your Letter rendered &s;o formidable to me? and, was it not by his Order that I was di&s;gracefully confined in a Dungeon all Night?</P>
<P>No, no, &s;aid my Lady, he would have &s;uffered the Rack fir&s;t. He is in De&s;pair, quite incon&s;olable on that Account. Let us go, my deare&s;t <HI>Harry,</HI> let us go and carry Comfort to him of whom you are the Beloved.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="191">
Ah no, my Mamma, cried out <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> let us put no Con&s;traint on Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> I pray you! there has been enough of Con|finement, we leave him now to his Liber|ty; let him go, even where, and to whom he likes be&s;t. Once, indeed, we could have tied this all-conquering Champion with the Spinning of a Silkworm; but now he tells us that neitheir Gates, Bars, not Bolts &s;hall hold him to us.</P>
<P>Here, I threw my&s;elf precipitately at her Feet, Pardon, pardon, my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> I cried, O pardon the mi&s;deeming Tran|&s;ports of your Lover, and pardon the Faults that Love alone could commit. My Enemies are foreign to me, they and their Injuries affect me not; but you are Regent within, my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> you &s;it throned in my Heart, and the Pre&s;umption of an Offence from you makes &s;trange Uproar in my Soul. Well, &s;ays &s;he, reaching her Hand and &s;miling through Tears, &s;ince it is &s;o, poor Soul, here is the golden Sceptre for you, I think I mu&s;t take you to Mercy.</P>
<P>I caught her Hand, and impre&s;&s;ed my very Spirit on the Wax, and my Lady, ca&s;ting her Arms about us, and ki&s;&s;ing us both, in Turns, reque&s;ted that we &s;hould
<PB N="193" REF="192">go and carry &s;ome Con&s;olation to her dear repining <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P>As we entered his Chamber, the Mar|chione&s;s cried out, here he comes, my Son, we have brought your Beloved to you, yet not your Mr. <HI>Goodall,</HI> as you thought, but One who is, at once, both your Good Angel and our good Angel, even our own <HI>Harry Clinton,</HI> the Betrothed of our Souls.</P>
<P>I took my Seat on the Side of the Mar|quis's Bed, and looking fondly upon him, would have enquired of his Health, but my Speech for the Time was overpowered by my Affections. Then, taking my Hand in his, the Power of this Hand, &s;ays he, I have found to be great, but, has your Heart the Power to pardon the In|&s;ults and Outrage you have received in the Hou&s;e of him who is &s;o deeply your Deb|tor? My Lord, &s;aid I, I have already drank largely of <HI>Lethe</HI> on that Head; nothing but my Diffidence of your Regard can of|fend me.</P>
<P>You know not, &s;aid my Lady, you know not yet, my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> how this provok|ing Bu&s;ine&s;s came about. I will explain it in a few Words.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="193">
On our Return to <HI>Paris,</HI> and on our Remon&s;trances to my late Lord of the in|e&s;timable Services you had rendered to his Family, he enquired your Character among the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and, notwith&s;tanding the Report of the Nobility of your Birth and your yet nobler Qualities, hearing al&s;o that you had acquired Part of your Fortune in Trade, he conceived an utter Contempt for you, and took an utter Aver|&s;ion to you.</P>
<P>Some Time after, as he took Notice that <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and I wanted our Watch and our Ring, I dreaded his Di&s;plea&s;ure, and gave him Room to think that the Robbers had taken them from us in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and this Report became current among our Dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>In the mean Time my Lord became importunate with our <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> re&s;pecting her Marriage with the Prince of <HI>C</HI>&mdash;who was then with the Army, and her Prayers and Tears, hitherto, had been the only Artillery which &s;he had u&s;ed in her Defence. But, when the Couriers brought Word that the Prince was on his Return, my Lord &s;ent for <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> and gave her in&s;tant and ab&s;olute Orders to prepare for her Nuptials. But &s;he, full as po&s;itive|ly and peremptorily, replied that her Soul
<PB N="195" REF="194">was already wedded, that &s;he would never pro&s;titute her Body where her Heart was an Alien, and that all the Tortures of the Inqui&s;ition &s;hould not change her Re&s;oluti|on. Her Father, thereupon, ro&s;e to &s;uch ungovernable Fury, that, with one Blow of his Hand he &s;truck her &s;en&s;ele&s;s to his Feet. But, when he &s;aw my Lamb, my Darling, all pale and as dead before him, the Tide of Nature returned, and the Conflict of his Pa&s;&s;ions became &s;o violent, that an Impo&s;tume broke in his Stomach, and, falling, he was &s;uffocated, and expired on the Spot.</P>
<P>Soon after, the Prince arrived. He had never &s;een my Daughter, but his Ambi|tion to po&s;&s;e&s;s a Beauty of whom the grand Monarch, him&s;elf, was &s;aid to have been enamoured, had cau&s;ed him to demand her in Marriage. For that Purpo&s;e he al&s;o did us the Honour of a Vi&s;it. <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> re|fu&s;ed to appear; and I told his Highne&s;s, with the be&s;t Grace I could, that &s;he hap|pened to be pre-engaged. In a few Days after, he met my Son in the <HI>Thuilleries</HI> and acco&s;ted him to the &s;ame Intent, but my Son had been previou&s;ly prejudiced in your Favour, my <HI>Harry,</HI> and an&s;wered the Prince with &s;o cold or &s;o haughty an Air, that further Words en&s;ued, they both drew, and his Highne&s;s was &s;lightly wounded,
<PB N="196" REF="195">but, as Company interpo&s;ed, the Affair was hu&s;hed up and, &s;hortly after, the Prince was killed in a nightly Broil upon the <HI>Pont neuf.</HI> We then wrote to our Friend <HI>De Wit</HI> to adverti&s;e you of the&s;e Matters, and to ha&s;ten you hither; but you arrived, my Child, you arrived before there could be any Expectation of an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Two Days ago, as I ob&s;erved that my Lamb's Spirits were &s;omething dejected, I prevailed upon her to take an Airing to our Country Villa. On our Return this Morning, we were &s;truck half dead with the News that our <HI>Lewis</HI> was wounded and dangerou&s;ly ill in his Bed. We flew into his Room, and were &s;till more alarmed to find him in a Fury that is not to be ima|gined, while <HI>Jacome,</HI> his old Steward, was on his Knees, all pale and quaking at a Di&s;tance before him. Villain, he cried, what have you done with my Friend, what have you done with my Champion, the Pre&s;erver of my Life? &mdash; Plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip, &s;aid he, trembling, I took him for a Highwayman, I &s;aw my Lady's Ring and my young Mi&s;tre&s;s's Watch in his Cu&s;tody, I will &s;wear to the Property be|fore the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;o I lodged him in Pri&s;on &mdash; till &mdash; till &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="196">
Go, Wretch, cried my Son, recall your Information, take all your Fellows with you, and in&s;tantly bring me back my Friend, or your Ears &s;hall be the Forfeit, but conduct him to his own Chamber, I cannot yet bear to &s;ee him, I cannot bear the Reproach that his Eye mu&s;t ca&s;t upon me.</P>
<P>All afflicted, and yet more a&s;toni&s;hed, my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and I &s;at down by the Side of my Son, ca&s;ting Looks of Surpri&s;e and en|quiring Doubt on Each Other. At length I &s;aid, what is this that I hear of our Ring, and our Watch? Alas, he is no Highway|man who took them from us, they were our own free Gift, a Mite in Return for a Million of Services. But do you know any thing of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or? I know, an&s;wer|ed <HI>Lewis,</HI> that he is the lovelie&s;t of Man|kind, the Pre&s;erver of my Life, and that his Name is <HI>Goodall.</HI> Ah! &s;creamed out <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> there we are lo&s;t again; this <HI>Good|all</HI> mu&s;t certainly have murdered our pre|cious <HI>Clinton,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of our Gifts, he would never have parted with them while he had Life. O my Si&s;ter, &s;aid my Son, when you &s;ee my Friend <HI>Goodall</HI> you will think nothing of your <HI>Harry Clin|ton;</HI> why, why were you &s;o ha&s;ty, &s;o pre|cipitate in your Choice? a Robber, a Mur|derer? no. Had I a thou&s;and Lives, I would
<PB N="198" REF="197">pawn them all for the Probity that Hea|ven has made apparent in the Face of my Pre&s;erver.</P>
<P>It is with Shame and great Reluctance, my deare&s;t Brother, that, at Times, I re|cite Pa&s;&s;ages tending &s;o much to my own Prai&s;e; and yet, did I omit them, I &s;hould do great Inju&s;tice to the kind and amiable Partiality of Tho&s;e who were &s;o fondly my Lovers and my Beloved.</P>
<P>But, Madam, &s;aid I to the Marchione&s;s, did you not hint &s;omething of his Maje&s;ty's being enamoured of my <HI>Loui&s;a?</HI> Ah, &s;uch a Rival would be a terrible Bu&s;ine&s;s indeed, e&s;pecially in a Country of unlimited Power.</P>
<P>There is no Fear of that now, &s;aid my Lady. The King has changed his Fancy, from young Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and old Coun&s;ellors, to young Coun&s;ellors and old Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. But, what I mentioned was once very &s;eri|ous and alarming.</P>
<P>My <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was &s;carce turned of fourteen, when the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Choi&s;&s;eul</HI> reque&s;ted her Company to <HI>Marlay</HI> where the Court then was. The King fixed his Eye on her and enquired who &s;he was, but took no further Notice at that Time. Mi&s;&s;ing her, however, at the next, and again at
<PB N="199" REF="198">the following Drawing-Room, he a&s;ked the Marquis what became of his fair Daughter, &s;aid he had a Place in his Eye for her, and de&s;ired, in an Accent of Authority, that he would &s;end her to Court.</P>
<P>The Marquis in&s;tantly took the Alarm. He was ever jealous of his Honour, and &s;ingularly nice in Matters of female Repu|tation. He gave his Maje&s;ty a Sort of equivocal Con&s;ent, and, hurrying Home, ordered me directly to prepare for carrying my Daughter out of the <HI>French</HI> Domini|ons. The Night was employed in ha&s;ten|ing and packing. We di&s;gui&s;ed our <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> in the Manner as you &s;aw her metamor|pho&s;ed at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and &s;et off for <HI>Holland</HI> before Day. The re&s;t you know, my <HI>Clinton,</HI> as You were the principal Mover in all our Concerns. &mdash; But, tell me, my <HI>Lewis,</HI> can you conjecture on what Account tho&s;e A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;et upon you? &mdash; I de|clare, Madam, &s;aid the Marquis, I can|not; perhaps they mi&s;took me for Ano|ther; or, now I recollect, it might be ow|ing to &s;ome familiar Chat which I had, the other Night, with a pretty Opera Girl, who is &s;aid to be in the keeping of a very great Man. But, Madam, you forgot to tell my Brother how my Father was bani&s;hed, on Account of <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> to his paternal Seat in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> on the Borders of the <HI>Mediter|ranean.</HI> Very true, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s,
<PB N="200" REF="199">and was not recalled till Madame <HI>Maintenon</HI> was taken into &s;upreme Favour.</P>
<P>But, I wonder what is become of our faithful <HI>Gerard,</HI> I thought that he would have been the fir&s;t to come and to throw him&s;elf at the Feet of his Hero. Indeed, my <HI>Harry,</HI> he would have tired Any, who loved you le&s;s, with his Prai&s;es and perpe|tual talking of you and your Exploits. &mdash; O, here he comes. &mdash; Step in, <HI>Gerard.</HI> Is there any One in this Company that you remember, be&s;ide the Family?</P>
<P><HI>Gerard</HI> then advanced with a half-frantic A&s;pect, and kneeling, and grappling at my Hand, &s;eemed de&s;irous of devouring it. God be prai&s;ed, he cried, God be prai&s;ed, my noble my glorious Ma&s;ter, that I &s;ee you once again, and above all that I have the Ble&s;&s;ing of &s;eeing you in a Place, where a Throne of beaten Gold &s;hould be rai&s;ed to your Honour. O, had I been here, all Sorts of Re&s;pects and Wor&s;hips, in&s;tead of Indignities, &s;hould have been paid to your De&s;ervings But, I have provided for the Hangdog <HI>Jacome,</HI> I have tied him Neck and Heels, and tumbled him into the dark Vault.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid I, but, my good Friend <HI>Gerard,</HI> I have not yet got my Share of Satisfaction upon him, pray &s;hew me where he is. I
<PB N="201" REF="200">then followed <HI>Gerard</HI> to the Place where the deplorable Wretch was ca&s;t; and, cut|ting all his Cords, I led him back to the Company, and warmly joined his Petition for Pardon and Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Jacome</HI> and <HI>Gerard</HI> were with|drawn. Ah, my Brother, cried the Mar|quis, what new Name &s;hall we find for a Man of your new Character? Moreover, what &s;hall we do with you, what &s;hall we do for you? You have quite overpower'd us, we &s;ink, we drown under the Sen&s;e of our Obligations. We have nothing worth your Acceptance, &s;ave this &s;imple Wench, and what is She in Compari&s;on of what we owe you? Ah, I cried, She is That with|out whom all Things are nothing; She is the living Trea&s;ure, the <HI>Rachel</HI> of <HI>Rachels;</HI> &s;eventy times &s;even Years were too &s;hort a Service for her! I would not exchange this little pearly Joint of this very little Finger for all the Gems that glow in the Mines of <HI>India,</HI> and &s;o &s;aying, I pre&s;&s;ed the precious Finger with my Lips; while <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> turned upon me an Eye of &s;uch ineffable Satisfac|tion and melting Acknowledgment, as &s;unk upon my Soul and wrapt it in <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI></P>
<P>Ay but, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid the Marquis, you ought not to prize your <HI>Louy</HI> as much as me; She did not fall in love with you at
<PB N="202" REF="201">fir&s;t Sight as I did. How do you know that, hone&s;t Friend, cried <HI>Loui&s;a.</HI> Is there a Nece&s;&s;ity that our Tongues as well as our Blu&s;hes &s;hould be Telltales? Are Maidens to trumpet forth their Thoughts, like You broad fronted Men, <HI>who&s;e Ornament is your Boldfacedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Thus happy, above All &s;tiled happy up|on Earth, we joyed and lived in Each Other, continuing a mutual Commerce of delightful Sen&s;ibilities and Love for Love.</P>
<P>Alas, our bli&s;sful Junto was &s;oon to be broken in upon. In a few Days, One of the royal Pages came and intimated to the Marchione&s;s that his Maje&s;ty required her immediate Pre&s;ence at Court. And we re|mained in a Kind of fearful and fluctuating Su&s;pen&s;e, till her Return.</P>
<P>As She entered, the Con&s;ternation in her Countenance in&s;tantly &s;truck an Alarm to all our Hearts. O, my Children, my dear, my dear Children, we mu&s;t part, &s;he cried, and that too, &s;peedily. Our Hour of Bli&s;s is pa&s;t, our Sun&s;hine is over, and the Clouds gather thick upon us, heavy laden with Wretchedne&s;s. Alas, my Heart mi&s;|gave me ever &s;ince that inau&s;picious En|counter the other Morning. As we came from our Villa a great Funeral met us (a
<PB N="203" REF="202">bad Omen as I have heard) Our Carriage &s;topped to let them pa&s;s, and the Carriage of the Duke of <HI>Ne&mdash;rs</HI> drove up be&s;ide us. As we remained within a few Paces of each other, he gazed at <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> with &s;uch an unmanner'd Inten&s;ene&s;s, as cau&s;ed her to colour and turn a&s;ide. However, he ac|co&s;ted us not, nor enquired concerning us; it &s;eems our Arms and Livery were too &s;ure an Indication of our Name and Quality. In &s;hort, on my approaching the Pre&s;ence, the King affected to &s;mile very graciou&s;ly upon me, and &s;aid, I have provided, Ma|dam, a noble and princely Hu&s;band for your Daughter; it is the Duke of <HI>Ne&mdash;rs.</HI> Ah, I cried, bending my Knee in a &s;uppli|cating Po&s;ture, my Daughter is already engaged by Bands of the mo&s;t endearing and indi&s;&s;oluble Obligations, to a Man who has pre&s;erved the Lives and Honours of all our Family, to a Man who, I tru&s;t, by his eminent Courage and Qualities, will become the brighte&s;t Jewel in your Ma|je&s;ty's Crown. Madam, &s;aid he &s;everely, you mu&s;t withdraw your Election, I find I have ordered Matters &s;uperior to your Me|rits, but my Will is the Law here, and &s;hall be obeyed. I ro&s;e, dejectedly curt&s;ied, and withdrew without Reply.</P>
<P>Ah, I exclaimed, on what Summit does this Rival hold his Abode? I will in&s;tantly
<PB N="204" REF="203">go and &s;cale it, and at once put an End to his Life and his Preten&s;ions! My Lady then, throwing her Arms about my Neck, and pre&s;&s;ing her Lips to my Cheek, what Ro|mance, &s;ays &s;he, is this, my <HI>Harry?</HI> would you at once fight the Duke, and the King, and the whole Army of <HI>France?</HI> No, my Child, Prudence reduces us to more &s;aluta|ry, however deplorable Mea&s;ures. We mu&s;t part, my <HI>Harry,</HI> we mu&s;t part this very Night, and my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> mu&s;t depart with you. My Chaplain &s;hall, this Minute, unite you by Ties that Death alone can &s;under. Alas, my precious Babes, I little expected that your Nuptials &s;hould be cele|brated by Tears and Wailings! But, bet|ter the&s;e than no Nuptials. When You are once joined I &s;hall care little for my&s;elf. And, if we meet no more here, we may yet meet hereafter, as happily as the Bar|barians who tear us a&s;under.</P>
<P>The Chaplain was then &s;ummoned and, having performed his Office, no Congratu|lations nor Salutations en&s;ued, &s;ave a Ki&s;s and a Sigh of mine on the Hand of my Angel. The Marquis then called me, and drawing me down to him, he pre&s;&s;ed me ardently to his Bo&s;om, cried O my <HI>Harry,</HI> O my <HI>Harry!</HI> bur&s;t into Tears and di&s;mi&s;s'd me.</P>

<P>Mean while, all was in Bu&s;tle and Hurry throughout the Palace. No Fe&s;tival was prepared, no Bridal Bed laid. Hor&s;es, Arms, and Carriages were all the Cry, and the Marchione&s;s, with an angui&s;hing Heart, but amazing Re&s;olution, i&s;&s;ued her Orders with a Pre&s;ence of Mind that &s;eemed &s;erene in the Mid&s;t of Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>I then &s;ent for my brave Fellows, with Orders to double their Arms, and to double their Ammunition. They came according|ly. It was now within three Hours of Day. All was di&s;patched, all in Readine&s;s, the Carriages were at the Gate. Silence &s;at on every Tongue and a Tear on every Cheek. I threw my&s;elf at my Mother's Feet, I cla&s;ped, I clung to them; &s;he wept aloud over me, but neither of us uttered a Word. When, rending my&s;elf away, I took my &s;obbing <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> under my Arm, &s;eated her gently in her Chariot, placed my&s;elf to &s;upport her, and away we drove.</P>
<P>When we got clear of the Town, and were &s;peeding on the Way, my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> &s;tarted and cried out, O, how fa&s;t, how very fa&s;t they take me from you, my Mamma! Whither, whither do they carry me, perhaps never to return, never to meet again! I an&s;wered not, but ki&s;&s;ed her Head and drew her gently to me, and &s;he
<PB N="206" REF="205">&s;eemed more at Ea&s;e. But, after a while, I felt her Agitation at my Bo&s;om, and &s;he exclaimed, From my Birth to this Hour of Wee, my ble&s;&s;ed Mamma, never was I from tho&s;e dear Arms of yours; &s;hall I ever, &s;hall I ever again behold tho&s;e Eyes that u&s;ed to look with &s;uch Fondne&s;s upon me?</P>
<P>Here, I could no longer contain, but taking her Hands between mine, and weeping upon them, I &s;aid, will you then, my Angel, are you re&s;olved upon breaking the Heart of your <HI>Harry?</HI> O no, &s;ays &s;he, no, not for Worlds upon Worlds would I break that dear and feeling Heart, the Heart of my Heart, the Heart of which I became enamoured. She then leaned her Head fondly over and, in awhile, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; while my Arms gently encircled and my Soul hovered over her, as the Wings of a Turtle over her new-begotten.</P>
<P>When She awoke and found her&s;elf &s;o endearingly &s;ituated; &s;he gave me a Look that overvalued the Ran&s;om of a Monarch; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my Hands, in turns, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the Skirts of my Garments. O, &s;he cried, I will endeavour, I will do my be&s;t to be more compo&s;ed. I know I ought not to repine. I am too rich, too happy. I ought to wi&s;h for nothing more, I ought to wi&s;h for no One more; &s;ince my <HI>Harry</HI> is &s;o near me, &s;ince I have him to my&s;elf. &mdash;
<PB N="207" REF="206">But &mdash; but &mdash; And here her lovely Lips began again to work; and the Drops that trembled in her living Brilliants could hardly be re&s;trained from breaking Pri&s;on. &mdash; Soon after, the Grief of her Heart overweighed her Spirits, and &s;he fell again a&s;leep into my Arms, that opened of them|&s;elves to receive her.</P>
<P>On &s;etting up for the Night, I rejoiced to find that my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was &s;omething more alive; and that her Repo&s;e on the Way had greatly deducted from the Fatigue that I apprehended.</P>
<P>When we had eaten a Bit of Supper, She looked to me and from me, with down|ca&s;t Lids; and, with changing Looks and a faultring Accent began to &s;ay; Will you, will you permit me, my Love, to be Re|gent for a little Time, and in a very trifling Matter? Allow me only to be Governe&s;s for a few Days, and I promi&s;e that you &s;hall be my &s;upreme Lord and &s;weet Ma&s;|ter all the re&s;t of my Life.</P>
<P>I &s;wear, &s;aid I in a Tran&s;port, by that precious Head, that you are already Queen-Regent of all my Thoughts and Actions; and that, during my Exi&s;tence, you &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of all that I have and all that I am, at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="207">
O then, &s;aid &s;he, my <HI>Harry,</HI> we mu&s;t lye apart for &s;ome Nights. I would not have our cha&s;te and ble&s;&s;ed Bridal &s;tained by Tears and Dirges. Nay, no He&s;itation, you have &s;worn that I am Ruler, and I will be obeyed.</P>
<P>I then ca&s;t my&s;elf at her Knees and, hiding my Face in her Lap, Cruel, cruel <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> I cried, I find You are not yet mine. What &s;hall I do to earn You? But, I will be patient, if po&s;&s;ible; I would not, for the World, put the Colour of Con&s;traint on the Love of my Beloved. And &s;o I ki&s;&s;ed her Gown, in Token of due Ho|mage.</P>
<P>Ari&s;ing, I called her Maids, and de&s;ired that they would order their Mi&s;tre&s;s's Chamber to be prepared, as al&s;o a Bed for them&s;elves in the &s;ame Apartment. I then &s;ecretly ordered that a Pallet &s;hould be &s;pread for my&s;elf before her outer Door, and, laying my&s;elf down, with my Arms at my Side, I guarded, like the Dragon of old, the precious Fruit of my <HI>He&s;peria.</HI></P>
<P>At length we reached <HI>Calais,</HI> and imme|diately &s;ent to the Beach to engage a Ship for wafting us over to the Land of Freedom and Rights, but the Wind was contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="208">
Mean while the Day advanced toward Evening, and my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and I &s;at toge|ther in the Arbour of a little Plea&s;ure-Gar|den that lay behind the Hou&s;e, when <HI>James</HI> came ha&s;tening to us and cried, Hide your|&s;elf, Madam, for Heaven's Sake hide your&s;elf! here is the Duke de <HI>Ne&mdash;rs</HI> with a large Party of the King's light Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> &s;tarted up and attempted to fly, but She trembled and grew faint, and &s;unk down again on her Seat.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> &s;aid I, &s;tay and take care of your Mi&s;tre&s;s. Then, turning with ha&s;ty Steps to the Hou&s;e, I recommended my Spirit in a &s;hort Ejaculation, and entered, deter|mined that the Duke &s;hould accompany me in Death. His Highne&s;s was in the Par|lour. I advanced fiercely toward him. So, Sir, &s;ays he, you have co&s;t us a warm Cha&s;e &mdash; Heavens, what do I &s;ee! &mdash; and, &s;o crying out, he threw him&s;elf back into an Arm Chair, all panting, and his A&s;pect working with Di&s;traction and Di&s;|appointment. &mdash; Cur&s;ed Chance! he again exclaimed, are you the Man, <HI>Clinton?</HI> &mdash; Ah, I mu&s;t not hurt You, I ought not to injure You, but, what is then to be done? &mdash; Where have you put my <HI>Loui&s;a?</HI> &mdash; But, no Matter, let her not
<PB N="210" REF="209">appear, let me not &s;ee her, I could not an|&s;wer the Con&s;equence. &mdash; I would be ju&s;t if I could, <HI>Clinton</HI> &mdash; O Love, O Honour, how you do di&s;tract me! &mdash; You refu&s;ed my Trea&s;ures and Jewels, <HI>Clinton,</HI> but then you have rent from me a Gem more e&s;ti|mable than my Dukedom &mdash; Help Saints, help Angels, help me to wre&s;tle with my&s;elf! &mdash; Honour, Virtue, Grati|tude, O, compel me to be ju&s;t! &mdash; Tear, tear me away, while there's Strength to depart! &mdash; Adieu, <HI>Clinton,</HI> you are recompen&s;ed; &s;hould we happen to meet again, I may a&s;&s;ail you without Reproach. And &s;o &s;aying, he ro&s;e &s;uddenly and ru&s;hed out of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I then ha&s;tened to &s;eek my Love, but had &s;carce entered the Garden, when I &s;aw <HI>James</HI> on his Knees before her, endeavour|ing to oppo&s;e her Way to the Hou&s;e. But &s;he cried, away, Villain, let me pa&s;s, they are murdering my Lord, they are murder|ing my Hu&s;band, I will go and peri&s;h with him: Then breaking away from him, &s;he &s;hot along like a Lapwing, till, &s;eeing me advancing, &s;he &s;prung upon my Bo&s;om, crying, O my <HI>Harry,</HI> O my <HI>Harry,</HI> are you &s;afe, are you &s;afe? and fainted away in my Arms.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of my Story, my Lord, is no way material or entertaining. The Serene
<PB N="211" REF="210">of heart-felt Happine&s;s has little of Adven|ture in it, and is only intere&s;ting to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled my Affairs in <HI>London,</HI> and carrying my <HI>Eden</HI> along with me, I pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Holland</HI> to &s;ettle and be quit of Mat|ters there al&s;o. For the World that I wi&s;hed was in my Holding, and all Things el&s;e appeared either nugatory or encum|bering.</P>
<P>It was there that I met our <HI>Meekly,</HI> and taking a plea&s;ant Tour through the Skirts of <HI>Germany,</HI> we entered <HI>France,</HI> and leav|ing <HI>Paris</HI> on the right Hand, we reached the Marquis's Country Seat, &s;ituate near twenty Leagues beyond the Metropolis.</P>
<P>What a Meeting, what an Interview! My <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> &s;unk in Tears, for Half an Hour, on the Bo&s;om of her Mother. And the Marquis would put me from him and pull me to him again, all panting with Tran|&s;port and in&s;atiate of his Care&s;&s;es! It was too much of Joy, it was Plea&s;ure to pain|ing. The Dome&s;tics would no longer be e&s;trained from their Share of the Felicity; they ru&s;hed in and, as though we had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ew de&s;cended Divinities, they dropped on their Knees, they fell pro&s;trate and clung about us, ki&s;&s;ed our Feet, our Hands, our
<PB N="212" REF="211">Garments, and broke forth into Cries, as though it had been the Hou&s;e of Mourning and Lamentation.</P>
<P>On retiring, they got my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI>'s <HI>Ge|rard</HI> to them&s;elves; he now became a Man of mighty Importance among them. They crowded about him and, in a joint Voice, but a Di&s;traction of Que&s;tions, enquired after our Travels, our Adventures, our good and evil Occurrences, and all that concerned us.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s then coming, and ca&s;t|ing her honoured Arms around me, and weeping upon me, cried aloud, O <HI>Harry,</HI> my Son, my Son, I delivered my Daugh|ter to you, even as <HI>Edna</HI> committed her <HI>Sarab,</HI> of &s;pecial Tru&s;t, to <HI>Tobias,</HI> and I &s;ee that you have entreated her very kindly, my Son, my Son!</P>
<P>As my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> now began to be apparent|ly pregnant, I earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed my precious Mother and Brother to accompany us to <HI>England,</HI> the Place where Law was Regent, where there was no Apprehen&s;ion of In|qui&s;itions or Ba&s;tiles; and where the Pea|&s;ant was guarded, as with a Bulwark of Adamant, again&s;t every Encroachment of arbitrary Power. They a&s;&s;ented with Joy, and the Marquis, going to his E&s;cri|toir, brought forth Bills to the amount
<PB N="213" REF="212">of ten Million of Livres, the Produce of &s;ome Concerns which he had di&s;po&s;ed of for the Purpo&s;e. Here, my Brother, &s;ays he, if I am not able to be grateful, if I am not able to be generous, I will at lea&s;t be ju&s;t; here is the Patrimony to which my lovely Si&s;ter is entitled. But, I &s;aid to the Marquis, my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> can admit of no Ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Value. Keep your Goods to your&s;elf. Remember how <HI>E&s;au</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Jacob,</HI> I have enough, enough, my Bro|ther, the&s;e Things can add nothing to the Abundance of my Ble&s;&s;ings. But then, he cried, you mu&s;t accept them, as a Token of our Loves, and &s;o he con&s;trained and im|pelled them upon me.</P>
<P>Soon after, we pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>London,</HI> where we continued &s;ome Months, and where my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was delivered of my little <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> who was &s;aid to be the beautiful Likene&s;s of her Father.</P>
<P>We then retired to my Seat near <HI>Strat|ford,</HI> on the fatal <HI>Avon,</HI> the chief of the landed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> had be|queathed me; where we remained &s;ome|thing upward of five Years, happy, I think, above All that ever were happy upon Earth. For my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was perpetual Fe&s;tivity to our Sight and to our Hearts; her Eyes beamed with living and &s;enti|mental
<PB N="214" REF="213">Glory, her Attitudes were Grace, her Movements were Mu&s;ic, and her Smiles were Fa&s;cination. Still varying yet exhibiting the &s;ame Delight, like the <HI>Northern</HI> Aurora &s;he &s;hone in all Directions. And &s;he &s;ported as though &s;he had gone to Heaven, from Time to Time, and bor|rowed all her Plays from the Kingdom of little Children.</P>
<P>But, &s;he needed not to go to Heaven, &s;ince Heaven was ever in her and round about her, and that &s;he could no more move from it than &s;he could move from her&s;elf. She had been, from her earlie&s;t Years, the beloved Di&s;ciple of the cele|brated Madam <HI>Guyon;</HI> and the World, with all its Concerns, its Riches and Re|&s;pects, had fallen off from her, as the Cloak fell away from the burning Chariot of <HI>Elijah.</HI> She looked at nothing but her Lord in all Things, &s;he loved nothing but him in any Thing. She was the &s;weete&s;t Playfellow that ever lived for the Babe of the Manger of <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> and he was, in her Heart, a Plea&s;ure pa&s;&s;ing Sen&s;e, as well as a Peace that pa&s;&s;ed Under&s;tanding. Even in conjugal Endearment, her Manner re|fined and cha&s;tened the Sen&s;e of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and her Pudicity awed me in the Mid&s;t of Tran&s;port.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="214">
Our Friends now prevailed upon us to accompany them, in our Turn, to <HI>France;</HI> together with our prattling <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> who was become the darling and in&s;eparable Com|panion of her Grandmother and her Uncle. We again took <HI>London</HI> in our Way. I there renewed, for a while, my old Ac|quaintance with my Fellows in Trade, and they per&s;uaded me to join them in a Pe|tition to his Maje&s;ty for the Re&s;toration of &s;ome of the lap&s;ed Rights of their Corpo|ration, as your Lord&s;hip may remember.</P>
<P>From <HI>Calais</HI> we turned and, by long but plea&s;ant Journeys, at length arrived at the Marquis's paternal Seat in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> that opened a delightful Pro&s;pect on the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> And here we continued upward of five Years more, even as <HI>Adam</HI> continued in Paradi&s;e, compa&s;&s;ed in by Bli&s;s, from the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>During this happy Period I often pre&s;&s;ed my dear Marquis to marry, but he would take me to his Arms and &s;ay, O my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;hew me but the mo&s;t di&s;tant Re&s;emblance of our <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> and I will marry and be ble&s;&s;ed without Delay.</P>
<P>In the mean while, my Angel made me he joyful Father of a little Son, who was, al&s;o, &s;aid to be the happier Re&s;emblance
<PB N="214" REF="215">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="215" REF="216">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="216" REF="217">of his happy Father. Then, though I had long di&s;regarded the World and all its Concerns, as I &s;aw a Family encrea&s;ing up|on me, and al&s;o con&s;idered the Poor as my appointed and &s;pecial Creditors; I re&s;olved once more to return and &s;ettle my long &s;u&s;pended Accounts.</P>
<P>As for the Marchione&s;s, &s;he prote&s;ted that &s;he could not think of parting with her little <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> and that &s;he &s;hould not be able to &s;urvive her Ab&s;ence ten Days. So my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and I, and my little <HI>Richard,</HI> who was named after you, my Lord, &s;et out by Sea and, after a favourable Voyage, arrived in <HI>England;</HI> comforted however with the Promi&s;e that our Friends would join us as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Within the ten &s;ub&s;equent Months, we received the joyful Tidings that our Bro|ther was married to the Third Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Alen&s;on,</HI> that they were all in the highe&s;t Triumph, and would &s;peedily be with us in a joint Jubilate on the Banks of the <HI>Avon.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after, as my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and I rode a|long the River, plea&s;ing our&s;elves with the Pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy Union with Per&s;ons &s;o dear to us, and talking and laughing away at the Cares of the Covetous and the Am|bition
<PB N="217" REF="218">of the High-minded; a Fowler inad|vertently fired a Shot behind us; and my Hor&s;e, bounding aloft, plunged with me into the Current, from whence however I was taken, and unwillingly re&s;erved to Years of inexpre&s;&s;ible Mi&s;ery, of a Mi&s;ery that admitted not of a Drop of Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Mean while my Love had fallen, with a Shriek, from her Hor&s;e and lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the Sod. Some of my People flew back, and bringing a Carriage conveyed us gently home, where my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was un|dre&s;&s;ed and put into a Bed, from whence &s;he never ro&s;e. Her Fright had given &s;uch a Shock to her Blood and Spirits as threw her into a violent Fever.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd Day, while I &s;at with the Phy&s;icians by her Side, <HI>James</HI> put in his Head and beckoned me forth. Ah, my deare&s;t Ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, I pray God to give you the Strength and Patience of <HI>Job;</HI> you have great Need of them, for your Calamities, like his, come All in a Heap upon you. Here is a Me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched from <HI>France</HI> with very heavy Tidings, that my &s;weet young Lady, your darling <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> was ca&s;t away, in a Sloop, upon a Party of Plea&s;ure, and that the good old Marchio|ne&s;s did not outlive her five Days. Then lifting my Eyes to Heaven, Strip, &s;trip me,
<PB N="218" REF="219">my God, I cried, to the Skin, to the Bone, leave, leave but my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> and I will ble&s;s thy Di&s;pen&s;ations!</P>
<P>On the next Day, my little <HI>Dickey</HI> was taken ill of a &s;evere Cold that he caught, through want of due Attention during the Sickne&s;s of his Mother. As he was of a florid Complexion, his Di&s;order fell &s;udden|ly in an Inflammation, on his Lungs, and in le&s;s than twenty-four Hours, he went to join his little Brother and Si&s;ters in their Eternity. Did I not feel the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es? Yes, yes, my Friends; they wrung, they rent my Vitals. Yet I &s;till lifted my Heart in an eager Prayer, and repeatedly cried, Take, take All, even the la&s;t Mite, leave, leave me but my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> and I will ble&s;s thee, O my Creator!</P>
<P>Alas, what could this avail! Can an In&s;ect arre&s;t the Motion whereby the round Univer&s;e continues its Cour&s;e? On the fifth Day I perceived that the Eyes of my <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> the Lamps of my Life, began to lo&s;e their Lu&s;tre. The Breath that was the Balm of all my Cares and Concerns grew difficult and &s;hort. The Ro&s;es of my Summer died away on her Cheek. All agonizing, I felt and participated her Changes, and &s;he expired, while I dropt and lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s be&s;ide her.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">
I knew not what our People did with her or me afterward. For three Weeks I lay in a Kind of do&s;ing but unea&s;y Stupor; neither do I recollect, during that Period, when, or whether I received any Kind of Su&s;tenance.</P>
<P>At length I awoke to the Poignancy and Bitterne&s;s of my Situation. I did not awake to Life, but rather to the blacke&s;t Gloom of the Regions of Death. And yet it was from this Depth and enfolding of Death alone, that my Soul could find, or would accept an Alleviation of its Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>O Earth, I cried, where is thy Centre, how deeply am I &s;unk beneath it! How are the Worms exalted over me! How much higher are the noxious Reptiles that crawl upon Earth! I will not accu&s;e thee, thou great Di&s;po&s;er, I have had my Day, the &s;weete&s;t that ever was allotted to Man; but O, thy pa&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings &s;erve only to enhance my pre&s;ent Mi&s;eries, and to render me the mo&s;t accur&s;ed of all thy Creatures.</P>
<P>I then ro&s;e, and threw my&s;elf along the Floor; and my faithful and valiant Com|panions immediately gathered to me. But, finding that I would not be removed, they ca&s;t them&s;elves around me.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">
All Light was &s;hut out, &s;ave the Glim|mering of a Taper, and for &s;even Nights and &s;even Days we dwelt in Silence, except the &s;olemn Interruptions of &s;mothered Sobs and Wailings.</P>
<P>At length my Spirit reproved me. What Property, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, have the&s;e Peo|ple in my Sufferings, or why &s;hould I bur|den tho&s;e who love me with my Afflicti|ons? I then con&s;trained my&s;elf and went and took out a Drawer. Here, my Friends, I &s;aid, here is &s;omething that may help hereafter to dry up your Tears. Divide the&s;e Thou&s;ands among ye; neither the&s;e Counters nor your Services are now of further U&s;e. Fare ye well, fare ye well, my worthy and beloved Brothers! God will give you a more gracious Ma&s;ter, but&mdash;but&mdash;&s;uch another Mi&s;tre&s;s ye ne|ver&mdash;never will find! I then took Each of them to my Arms, and ki&s;&s;ed them, in turns, and the Hou&s;e was in|&s;tantly filled with heart-tearing Lamenta|tions.</P>
<P>I now expected and wi&s;hed to be left wholly alone, but <HI>James</HI> and two Do|me&s;tics remained again&s;t my Will. I then endeavoured to &s;eem ea&s;y, I even &s;trug|gled to appear chearful, that I might com|municate the le&s;s of Grief to the voluntary
<PB N="221" REF="222">Sharers in my Mi&s;ery. O World, World, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, thou once plea&s;ant World, we have now bid a long an eternal Adieu to Each Other! From thee I am cut a&s;un|der, thou art annihilated to me, and we mu|tually reject every Kind of future Com|merce.</P>
<P>Ah, how much deeper was my Death than that of tho&s;e in the Tomb, <HI>where the Wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the Weary are at Re&s;t.</HI> While I was dead to every Reli&s;h of Light and of Life, I was wholly alive to all the Gloom and Horrors of the Grave. The Rays of the Sun be|came an Offence to my Soul, the Verdure of the Fields, the whole Bloom of Nature were bla&s;ted and bla&s;ting to my Sight; and I wi&s;hed to &s;ink yet deeper, and to own a lower Bottom to my&s;elf of Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I no longer regarded what the World thought of me, or what it did to me, and I left my Hairs and my Nails, even as tho&s;e of <HI>Nebuchadnezar,</HI> to grow like Eagle's Feathers and Birds Claws.</P>
<P>My Friend <HI>James,</HI> in the mean Time, took a Place for me in this Town, in or|der to remove me from Scenes that could only &s;erve to perpetuate or aggravate my
<PB N="222" REF="223">Mi&s;ery, by reminding me of the Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s that I had once enjoyed.</P>
<P>He was now become my Controuler. I was patient and pa&s;&s;ive to any Thing, to every Thing, and &s;o he conducted me hi|ther, I neither knew nor cared how.</P>
<P>In all this Time, though I panted after a State of In&s;en&s;ibility, even as a Traveller, in the burning De&s;art, thir&s;ts after a cool and &s;laking Stream. I never attempted to lay a violating Hand on the Work of my Creator. I did not even wi&s;h an Alleviation of my Mi&s;ery, &s;ince my God had appointed that I &s;hould be &s;o very mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>At length, my Spirit ro&s;e from its Black|ne&s;s to a Kind of calm Twilight. I called for a Bible and, &s;ince this World was in|capable of a Drop of Con&s;olation, I wi&s;hed to know if the next had Any in Store.</P>
<P>As I read, the Whole of the Letter, and of the Facts contained therein, appear|ed as &s;o many Seals and Veils that remov|ed from before my Eyes, and di&s;covered Depths under Depths, and Heavens above Heavens to my amazed Apprehen&s;ion. I had no Vi&s;ion, no Revelation of the&s;e Mat|ters; but the Conviction was impre&s;&s;ed as &s;trongly on my Soul, as though an An|gel
<PB N="223" REF="224">or God him&s;elf had revealed them to me.</P>
<P>How this came to pa&s;s I know not; <HI>Homer</HI> gives to his Heroes a Sight into Fu|turity at the Time that their Spirits are breaking away from the Shackles of Fle&s;h and Blood. And it is not unlikely that the Eye of the Soul when wholly turned from all carnal and earthly Objects, can pe|netrate with the greater Scope and Clarity into Concerns that are merely cele&s;tial and divine.</P>
<P>I have now told ye the Whole of my dreary Hi&s;tory, my Friends, till I met with our <HI>Harry,</HI> and the re&s;t our <HI>Harry</HI> can tell.</P>
<P>But <HI>Harry</HI> was in no Manner of Vein, at pre&s;ent, for entertaining or receiving Entertainment from any One. His Eyes were &s;welled with weeping, his Spirits to|tally depre&s;&s;ed, and getting up, as with the Burden of four&s;core Years on his Shoul|ders, he retired &s;lowly and &s;ilently to his Apartment.</P>
<P>Here, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> took the Opportuni|ty of our Hero's Ab&s;ence, to appri&s;e the Company of what had pa&s;&s;ed re&s;pecting the fair <HI>Aggy Je&s;&s;amin.</HI> And why, my dear <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, why would you
<PB N="224" REF="225">baulk my Boy? I would rather than fifty thou&s;and broad Pieces get any Offspring of my <HI>Harry</HI> into my Arms, however little it might be, legitimate or illegitimate. He is a glorious Fellow, he cannot be deba&s;ed by marrying a Kitchen Wench, although his Alliance would ennoble a Prince&s;s. What's your Opinion, Brother? Indeed, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> if the Girl is virtuous, as her Countenance promi&s;es, I have no Ob|jection.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> in&s;tantly went, with the&s;e indulgent Tidings to <HI>Harry,</HI> but he &s;hook his Head, and &s;aid, No no, my Friend, I will not abu&s;e their Goodne&s;s. Be&s;ide, &s;ince I hear'd the Story of my Uncle's <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> my Pa&s;&s;ion is not quite &s;o violent. I have formed a perfect Idea of the Bride I would wi&s;h; and, if I get not &s;ome One an&s;wering to the Image in my Heart, I will go unmarried to my Tomb. Yet, as I &s;till ardently love the &s;weet Girl, I would not for the World ri&s;que the Temptation of a Meeting with her; and I am willing to pay roundly for her Removal. Be plea&s;|ed then, my dear Friend, to &s;ettle this Matter with her Father, the &s;tipulated Sum &s;hall be ready, on Demand, to any Amount that you plea&s;e, if they may &s;erve to promote her Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="226">
On the next Day, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> introduced to <HI>Harry</HI> a tall and comely young Man in a pea&s;ant Dre&s;s, but of an Air and Deport|ment much &s;uperior to his Appearance. My Lord, &s;aid <HI>Meekly</HI> as he entered, you mu&s;t quit all further Thoughts of the love|ly Mi&s;s <HI>Je&s;&s;amin.</HI> I have here brought a prior Claimant to whom, I am confident, the Probity, the Genero&s;ity of your Heart will give Place.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> ro&s;e to receive him, when the Stranger, looking earne&s;tly and amazedly at him, cried out, Ah no, we mu&s;t All give Place here, I find. Does &s;he know him, has <HI>Aggy</HI> &s;een him? I will then go and bury my&s;elf where my Heart may break in De&s;pair of ever reclaiming her Affections.</P>
<P>No fear, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> reaching his Hand, give me but to know that you have entitled your&s;elf to her Regards, and my own Heart &s;hall break in a thou&s;and Pieces, rather than oppo&s;e or di&s;turb the Peace of two gentle Lovers.</P>
<P>I will give you our Story, my Lord, in a very few Words. Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI> and my Father <HI>Je&s;&s;op</HI> &s;erved an Apprentice&s;hip to the &s;ame Merchant, and, when that was expired, they joined in Trade to the <HI>Levant.</HI> But, as my Father was of the
<PB N="226" REF="227">more adventurous Temper, they &s;oon af|ter broke Partner&s;hip. My Father traded to <HI>Turkey</HI> and the I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI> confined him&s;elf to the <HI>Italian</HI> Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>In one of his Voyages to <HI>Genoa,</HI> he there married and begot the charming <HI>Aggy,</HI> and, returning to <HI>London</HI> after a Number of Years, he fitted out a Ship of con&s;iderable Force in order to convoy his Wife and Daughter, with all his Trea&s;ures to <HI>En|gland.</HI></P>
<P>On their Way home they were taken by a <HI>French</HI> Privateer. Their Ship and rich Cargo were &s;ent to <HI>Toulon.</HI> And Mrs. and Mi&s;s <HI>Je&s;&s;amin,</HI> with &s;ome other Pri&s;oners, were taken on board the Enemy's Ve&s;&s;el, that proceeded on her Crui&s;e for further Captures.</P>
<P>I happened, at the Time, to be on my Return homeward, in a Ship called, WEL|COME ENEMIES; &s;he had the Appearance of a Merchant, but was actually better fitted for War than Trade.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Privateer came up with us, and bearing on us, with Confidence, com|manded us to &s;trike; but we an&s;wered them with an unexpected Broad&s;ide and,
<PB N="227" REF="228">coming to clo&s;e Quarters, we nearly cleared their Deck by the Di&s;charge of our &s;mall Arms. Soon after, we grappled and board|ed; when, ha&s;tening down to the Cabbin, I there for the fir&s;t Time beheld my <HI>Aggy,</HI> in a fainting Fit, with her lovely Head re|clined on the Lap of her Mother.</P>
<P>As I kneeled to give A&s;&s;i&s;tance toward her Recovery, &s;he fir&s;t opened the Morning of her Eyes upon me, then turning them to her Mother, cried, Ah, Madam, what new Misfortune has been added to our Mi&s;ery? I hope we have not fallen into the Hands of the Infidels. No, Mi&s;s, I &s;aid, you are free, you are free, and you are freed by Hands that offer them&s;elves of their own Accord to your Shackles.</P>
<P>When we came to Port, I divided the Freight of our Prize among the brave Fel|lows who had &s;econded me &s;o gallantly. And, having &s;old the Ve&s;&s;el for three and twenty hundred Pounds, I compelled Mrs. <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI> to accept of it, as &s;ome &s;mall Com|pen&s;ation for the Lo&s;&s;es that her Family had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had paid my Duty to my Father, and that the Warmth of his fir&s;t Care&s;&s;es was over. Sir, &s;aid I, I have melancholy News to tell you. I fear your old Friend and Partner, Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;amin,</HI> is
<PB N="228" REF="229">undone, as to Trade; great Part of his Fortune has been &s;eized by the <HI>French,</HI> and that may prove a heavy Lo&s;s to my&s;elf al&s;o. He has but one Daughter, and might I prevail upon her to accept of my Hand, I &s;hould thereby become entitled to all her Father's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But, Sir, I cried, ca&s;ting my&s;elf pa&s;&s;ionately at his Feet, if the Happine&s;s of your Son is of any Weight with you, You will &s;till a&s;&s;ent to our Union, and thereby make me the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed of all human Beings!</P>
<P><HI>Everard,</HI> &s;aid my Father, &s;edately, you know I love you, and I am willing to di|vide that Love between your Fancy and your Fortune. If <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI> lays down twen|ty thou&s;and Pounds, in Hand, toward portioning your four Si&s;ters, I will con&s;ent to your Union. And that's what I would not do, with any other Wench, under double that Sum.</P>
<P>As I knew my Father's Di&s;po&s;ition to be as ob&s;tinate as it was affectionate, I ro&s;e and retreated without Reply. I in&s;tantly went to Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI>'s, I found my Char|mer alone. I threw my&s;elf at her Knees. I &s;olicited, I urged her to an immediate Marriage. When, blu&s;hing like the Morn|ing, when it ari&s;es as a&s;hamed of the Bright|ne&s;s that it brings, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, we owe
<PB N="229" REF="230">you all Things, I never can refu&s;e you any Thing that Virtue will allow me to grant. Ah, how cold is that, I cried; I will not accept You as a Debt, my <HI>Aggy,</HI> if your Heart is not a free-will Offering, then let mine bur&s;t in &s;under, they can have no Commerce together. Indeed, &s;ays &s;he, giving her Hand, I never had an Inclina|tion for any Other, and I have in the World but the one Objection to you. What is that, what is that?&mdash;It is, &s;he cried, with filling Eyes, that I fear to hurt You by a Match &s;o very much di&s;|proportioned to your Merits.</P>
<P>Her Parents entered and found me &s;till at her Feet. I ro&s;e in much Confu&s;ion and, taking a Seat, I candidly told them what had pa&s;&s;ed between my Father and me; and urged the &s;ame Petition to them that I had to their Daughter; when Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;a|min,</HI> recollecting him&s;elf, gave me an An|&s;wer de&s;erving of everla&s;ting Memorial.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;op,</HI> &s;ays he, had I a Province to be&s;tow along with my Child, you &s;hould have it as freely as I would give, of my Water-Ci&s;tern, to a thir&s;ty Traveller. But here it happens that the ine&s;timable Obliga|tions, which you have heaped upon my Family, are quite aver&s;e to the Promotion of your pre&s;ent De&s;ires.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231">
In the fir&s;t Place, as a Man of Probity, if I wi&s;h, one Day, to merit the Happine&s;s of your Alliance, I cannot con&s;ent to be a Party in any clande&s;tine Matter. Again, &s;hall a Heart, full, and bur&s;ting with Gra|titude, be a Partaker in bringing either Da|mage or Di&s;grace, on the only One whom I account my Benefactor and Patron? La&s;t|ly, &s;hall a Father, who e&s;timates the Ho|nour of his Child, as a Pearl above the World's Purcha&s;e; &s;hall he &s;ubject her ten|der, perhaps her melting Gratitude, to the Temptation of yielding further than &s;he ought? or even to the Temptation of bind|ing her virtuous Affections beyond the Pow|er of a Retreat? This would be too &s;evere a Tribute even for All that you have done for us. Do not exact it, my Son. My Heart wrings under the Nece&s;&s;ity of reject|ing your Suit. You cannot be pained as I am by this Refu&s;al. But it is inevitable. You and my Daughter mu&s;t meet no more till the&s;e Clouds are overpa&s;&s;ed and that a new Light, of happier Influence, begins to dawn upon us.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered not. I wept where I &s;at for Half an Hour, I was not unaccompanied, and I then withdrew.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, I begin to grow tedious in Spite of my Intentions. I returned to
<PB N="231" REF="232">my Father and reque&s;ted him, in order, as I &s;aid, to get rid of my pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;ion, that he would di&s;patch me abroad upon ano|ther Voyage.</P>
<P>I had given him a very lucrative Account of my la&s;t, and that made him the le&s;s inqui&s;itive re&s;pecting the Prize we had taken.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ented with Joy, as he feared that my Love might yet contend, and prevail in the Combat again&s;t Duty. And he took upon him&s;elf the Care of equipping out my Ship in a more gallant Plight than ever.</P>
<P>The Day before I went on board, I &s;tepped to Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI>'s. My <HI>Aggy</HI> did not appear, and I found her Parents em|ployed in preparing for a di&s;con&s;olate Re|treat to the Country. I told them I came to take my Leave, and a&s;ked if they would &s;end any Venture by me. The very wor|thy Man then went to his De&s;k and, taking out the Bills of the Sale of the Privateer, here, my <HI>Everard,</HI> &s;ays he, I have nothing to adventure with you &s;ave your own free Gift. The Remainder of the Wreck of my Fortune is little enough to &s;upply us with very frugal Accommodations, in our de&s;ired Exclu&s;ion from the World and its Ways. And here is a little Note of the Place of our Retreat, if ever, my Child, if
<PB N="232" REF="233">ever&mdash;if ever we &s;hall happen to meet on this Side of Eternity! O, I cried, ki&s;&s;ing the Bills, if I do not bring you a good Account of the&s;e Ventures, never, indeed, &s;hall we meet, till parting &s;hall be no more!</P>
<P>We then &s;et about taking Leave, and having &s;everal Times ru&s;hed alternately into the Arms of Each other, we again &s;at down and wept, till no Tears were left; when, rending my&s;elf away from them, and nearly blind to the Way that I went, I departed.</P>
<P>Within a Year and a Half I returned, and, in a Storm, put in at <HI>Plymouth.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding the Intrepidity, and great Affection of my Companions; though I had made Death and Succe&s;s as Matters equally indifferent, and on one of which I was determined; yet, our high Hopes and Enterprizings had failed us on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, and I am come back with little more than ten thou&s;and Pounds for Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;amin,</HI> over the Produce of the Voyage which my Father may exact from me.</P>
<P>Wherefore, with po&s;t Hor&s;es, and a beating Heart, I have cro&s;&s;ed the Country in Di&s;gui&s;e, impatient, yet fearful, to know, how the Heart of the nobly inexorable
<PB N="233" REF="234"><HI>Je&s;&s;amin,</HI> may be affected toward me, and this Morning, as I &s;kulked about the Hou&s;e, this Gentleman met me and, having que&s;|tioned me, brought me directly to your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Harry</HI> covered his Eyes with his Hand, and mu&s;ing for a Time, at length &s;aid, I fear, my Friends, it may be difficult to bring this Matter about with Propriety. I would not willingly affront Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;op</HI> here, by a Gift of the Sum that is deficient to his Happine&s;s. Neither, indeed, would it be duely delicate in Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;op</HI> to offer, to his Father-in-law, a Penny beyond what his Venture, &s;o well &s;upported by Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;op</HI>'s Bravery, had acquired. You therefore, my dear Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;hall be the Conduit of the Expedient that I propo&s;e on the Occa|&s;ion. I que&s;tion if the War was proclaim|ed when <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI>'s Ship was made Prize; but, be that Matter as it may, I tru&s;t I have Intere&s;t &s;ufficient to procure a Re&s;to|ration the fir&s;t Treaty of Peace. Do you therefore, my Friend, get me an Order from <HI>Je&s;&s;amin</HI> for &pound;.10000, on the fir&s;t of his Effects in <HI>France,</HI> (with legal Intere&s;t however) and then take this Key and deli|ver to our Friends the very utmo&s;t of the Sum required by the Father of the darling Fellow who is now before me.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
<HI>Meekly</HI> then &s;prung up, advanced in Years as he was, and catching and clinging about <HI>Harry,</HI> O my Hero, my <HI>Scipio,</HI> he cried, you are the Champion whom Hea|ven delighteth to empower to &s;ubdue it&s;elf by Violence! Go on, till the Wreath of Triumph &s;hall be bound to your Head in all its prepared Glories!</P>
<P>Mean while, young <HI>Je&s;&s;op,</HI> lay pro&s;trate, in the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Agony of Gratitude, at the Feet of his younger Patron. But <HI>Harry</HI> gently and affectionatly di&s;engaging him&s;elf from them, withdrew to his Clo&s;et, &s;aying to his own Heart; now <HI>Aggy</HI> adieu, adieu <HI>Aggy,</HI> for ever!</P>
<P>For three &s;ucceeding <HI>Sundays,</HI> our Hero hear'd the Bands of Marriage publi&s;hed be|tween <HI>Everard Je&s;&s;op</HI> and <HI>Agnes Je&s;&s;amin,</HI> all which he bore with the Firmne&s;s of a Stoic, or rather with the Re&s;ignation of a Chri&s;tian who keeps a Look forward to a more pearly Hope.</P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;ome may be curious to know how <HI>Aggy</HI> &s;tood affected in regard to our young Lord. Let it &s;uffice to be told that &s;he made the worthie&s;t of Wives to the very worthy <HI>Everard,</HI> notwith&s;tanding that he had the Imprudence to tell her of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Regard for her, as al&s;o of the Obligations by
<PB N="235" REF="236">which he had bound them. <HI>Aggy,</HI> there|fore, could not ju&s;tly refu&s;e <HI>Harry</HI> a Share in her Friend&s;hip, and there is &s;omething extremely tender in the Friend&s;hip of a ge|nerous Female.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, in about three Weeks after her Marriage, as &s;he walked, with two fair Vi&s;itants, in a plea&s;ant Field behind the Town, &s;he &s;aw our Hero coming to|ward her, attended by two Servants, and galantly mounted on a proud young Steed, whom he had undertaken to dre&s;s, and was now gracefully riding to the Manage.</P>
<P>She felt a &s;udden Alarm &s;he knew not why, and, as <HI>Harry</HI> approached, &s;he turn|ed away that he might not recognize her. But, as &s;oon as he had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he gave one Look after him, and feeling her&s;elf di&s;compo&s;ed by a little hy&s;terical Fit, &s;he &s;at down on the Gra&s;s between her Com|panions, and wept till &s;he was re&s;tored to her Strength and Spirits.</P>
<P>In a few Days after, &s;he &s;et out for <HI>Lon|don,</HI> where &s;he became the daily Idol of her Father-in-law, and &s;aw our <HI>Harry</HI> no more.</P>
<P>On an Evening, after Coffee, as the Earl &s;tood fondly fooling with his <HI>Harry,</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="237">as one Child with Another, he turned to Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> and &s;aid, How came it to pa&s;s, my Brother, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;uffered near four thou&s;and Years to elap&s;e, before he became incarnate for the Salvation of the World, although it was by him alone that the World could be &s;aved?</P>
<P>We may as well demand of God, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> why he &s;uffered near four Days of Creation to lap&s;e, before he com|pacted yon glorious Body of far beaming Light. For, this Matter was barely a Type, and the Sun him&s;elf but a Shadow of the CHRIST that was to come. But, did the World want Light, before Light became incorporated in its illu&s;trious Cir|cum&s;cription? No, my Lord. JESUS, who was from Eternity the Illumination of the dark Immen&s;ity of Nature; <HI>Je&s;us</HI> who, a|lone, is the living Light of Spirit, Soul, and Sentiment; the perpetual Fountain of the Streams of Beauty and Truth; he &s;aid, LET THERE BE LIGHT! and in&s;tantly, through the Darkne&s;s of a ruined World, the <HI>Internity</HI> of his ever living Light kindled up an <HI>Externity</HI> of corporeal Irradiation, that has its Effluence from him, and cannot beam but by him.</P>
<P>Now, as a Day is as a thou&s;and Years, and a thou&s;and Years as a Day, in the Sight of God; you &s;ee that the fourth Day of Crea|tion,
<PB N="237" REF="238">wherein the Light of this outward World was compacted into the glorious Body of the Sun, preci&s;ely an&s;wers to the four thou&s;andth Year, wherein <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Light of Eternity was to become embodied and incarnate in Chri&s;t the SUN OF RIGH|TEOUSNESS.</P>
<P>But, as the World wanted not Light, before the Sun opened his fir&s;t Morning in the Ea&s;t, neither did it want the Means of Salvation before the ble&s;&s;ed Doctrine of MESSIAH was promulged upon Earth!</P>
<P>All Sorts of Sectarians, All Per&s;ons of &s;elfi&s;h and little Minds would make a Mo|nopoly of the SAVIOUR, they would &s;hut him up into a Conventicle, and &s;ay to their God, <HI>thus far &s;halt thou go, and no further.</HI> But he is not &s;o to be confined. The Spi|rit of our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> bloweth wide and where he li&s;teth. And he is at once both the Puri|fier and Redeemer, as well of all Nations, as al&s;o of all Nature.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we &s;ee that the <HI>Turks,</HI> who are wholly unble&s;&s;ed by true Religion or Liberty; who live the Slaves of Slaves; without a Form of civil Government; tem|porally &s;ubjected to the Will of a Tyrant; and &s;piritually to the Wor&s;hip of a &s;en&s;ual Impo&s;tor; yet want not the Feelings of our JESUS in their Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239">
Even the wild <HI>Indians,</HI> who never li&s;ten|ed to the Toll of a Bell, nor ever were called into any Court of civil Judicature; The&s;e want not their Attachments, their Friend&s;hips, their Family-feelings, nor the &s;weet Compunctions and Emotions of the human Heart, by <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> forming to DI|VINE.</P>
<P>The Truth is that People live, incom|parably more, by Impul&s;e and Inclination than by Rea&s;on and Precept. Rea&s;on and Precept are not always within our Beck; to have their due Influence, they require frequent Inculcation and frequent Recollec|tion; but Impul&s;e and Inclination are more than at Hand, they are within us, and, from the Citadel, rule the Outworks of Man at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of CHRIST, affirms that <HI>there is no other</HI> NAME <HI>under Heaven whereby a Man may be &s;aved.</HI> And again, when he affirms that Tho&s;e, <HI>who have not received the Law, are a Law unto them&s;elves.</HI> He intends one and the &s;ame Thing. He intends that CHRIST, from the Fall of Man, is a PRINCIPLE OF RE|DEMPTION in the Bo&s;oms of All Living. That he is not an <HI>outward</HI> but an <HI>inward Redeemer,</HI> working out our Salvation <HI>by
<PB N="239" REF="240">the Change of our depraved Nature.</HI> That in and from Him, alone, ari&s;e all the Senti|ments and Sen&s;ibilities, that warm the Heart with Love, that expand it with Ho|nour, that wring it with Compunction, or that heave it with the Story of di&s;tant Di&s;|tre&s;s. And that He alone can be qualified to be Judge at the la&s;t Day, Who, from the fir&s;t Day to the la&s;t, was internally a Co-Operator and Witne&s;s of all that ever pa&s;&s;ed within the Bo&s;oms of all Men.</P>
<P>Hence it is that, although the Chri&s;tian Countries have received the <HI>two Tables</HI> of the Laws of Chri&s;t, his <HI>external</HI> as well as <HI>internal Revelation,</HI> (Each witne&s;&s;ing to the Other that the God of our <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is the God of our <HI>Nature</HI>) the Nations however, who are Strangers to his Name, yet ac|knowledge his Influence, they do not in|deed <HI>hear,</HI> but they <HI>feel</HI> the Precepts of that LIGHT <HI>which lighteth every Man who com|eth into the World.</HI></P>
<P>My deare&s;t Brother, &s;aid the Earl, my Conceptions are quite clear with re&s;pect to the Omnipre&s;ence of Chri&s;t's Divinity. But, as his Body is circum&s;cribed by external Features and Lineaments, I can form no Notion of its being in &s;everal Places at once. How then will it be, I pray you, at and after the la&s;t Day? Will he be pre&s;ent to, and approachable only by a &s;elect Number
<PB N="240" REF="241">of his Saints; or will he go certain Journeys and Circuits through the Heavens, ble&s;&s;ing All, in Rotation, with his beatific Pre|&s;ence?</P>
<P>Is not the Body of yonder Sun circum|&s;cribed, my Lord? Mo&s;t certainly &mdash; It is now, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> at a Di&s;tance of many Millions of Leagues from You, and yet You &s;ee it as evidently and feel its In|fluence as powerfully as if it were within your Reach. Nay, it is more than within your Reach, it is within your Exi&s;tence. It &s;upplies Comfort and Life to your animal Body and Life; and you could not &s;urvive an Hour without its Influence and Opera|tions.</P>
<P>Now, this is no other than the apt Type and prefiguring Promi&s;e of what Chri&s;t will be to his New-begotten in the Re&s;urrection, when <HI>Corruption &s;hall be &s;wallowed up of Glory and Mortal of Immortality.</HI> The &s;ame ble&s;&s;|ed Body which, for the Redemption of commi&s;erated Sinners, went through the &s;hameful and bloody Proce&s;s of Scourges, Thorns, Spittings, and Buffettings; which hung &s;ix agonizing Hours on the Cro&s;s; which de&s;cended into the Grave, and thence opened the Way through Death into Life, and through Time into Eternity; Even this Body &s;hall then &s;hine forth in ineffable
<PB N="241" REF="242">Beauty and Beatitude, in effentially com|municative Grace and Glory; through the Heighth and through the Depth, through the Length and through the Breadth, beam|ing wide beyond the Univer&s;e, from In|finity to Infinity.</P>
<P>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, will then become co-embodied in this divine Body; they will be the Repletion of it, they will operate all Things by it. To bring the Creator nearer to his Creatures, the invi|&s;ible Godhead will then become vi&s;ible, the Infinite circum&s;cribed, the Unapproachable acce&s;&s;able, and the Incomprehen&s;ible com|prehended, within the Humanity of our CHRIST.</P>
<P>Then will his Cro&s;s be exalted, for an En&s;ign to the circling, bending, and wor|&s;hipping Univer&s;e. His Wreath of Thorns will kindle all Nature with the Dartings and Ca&s;tings forth of its Corru&s;cations. And his Reed of Mockery will become the Sceptre of unlimited Domination.</P>
<P>From his five Wounds &s;hall be poured forth ince&s;&s;ant Floods of Glory and wide diffu&s;ing Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s upon all his Redeem|ed. Adoring Worlds, in &s;elf-Abjection, &s;hall &s;trive to &s;ink beneath the Abjection that became their Salvation. The&s;e ever apparent En&s;igns of &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed
<PB N="242" REF="243">Benefits &s;hall inevitably attract the Wills of all Creatures, they &s;hall cau&s;e all Hearts and Affections to ru&s;h and cleave to him, as Steel Du&s;t ru&s;hes to Adamant, and as Spokes &s;tick in the Nave whereon they are centred. There &s;hall be no Lap&s;e thence-forward, forward, no Falling away, for ever. But God in his Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in his Re|deemed, &s;hall be a Will and a Wi&s;dom, and an Action and a Mightine&s;s, and a Goodne&s;s and a Graciou&s;ne&s;s, and a Glory ri&s;ing on Glory, and a Ble&s;&s;ing ri&s;ing on Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, through an ever beginning to a never ending ETERNITY.</P>
<P>O Brother, Brother, Brother! exclaimed the Earl, I am enraptured, I am entranced! &mdash; I &s;ee it all, I feel it all. I am already, with all my Corruptions, with all my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, de&s;irous of being cru&s;h|ed to Nothing under the Foot of my Re|deemer. But he comforts in&s;tead of cru&s;h|ing me. O that I were this Night, this very Moment to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with my Chri&s;t!</P>
<P>That Night, the Earl was quite happy and plea&s;ant, and affectionate even beyond his Cu&s;tom. He &s;aid and did every Thing that could be endearing to his <HI>Harry</HI> and to his Friends. He care&s;&s;ed them at part|ing for Bed. He &s;milingly &s;hook Hands with all the Dome&s;tics that approached
<PB N="243" REF="244">him; and, in the Morning, was found dead, without any Notice or Warning to the Servants who attended and lay in the Room.</P>
<P>A &s;udden and grievous Alarm was in|&s;tantly given through the Family, and quickly reached the Town, and &s;pread through the adjacent Country.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> fell upon his Father's Face, and wept upon him, and ki&s;&s;ed him, and wept aloud, and ki&s;&s;ed him again, crying, my Father, O my Father!</P>
<P>And they laid his Remains in a plated Coffin, under E&s;cutcheons and a &s;able Ca|nopy of Velvet. And the Hou&s;e and the Court was circled with Mourners from all Parts. And they mourned for him fifty and nine Days. And, on the &s;ixtieth Day, he was depo&s;ited in his Family Tomb; but Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> would not permit <HI>Harry</HI> to at|tend the Funeral of his Father.</P>
<P>Our Hero was now the Ma&s;ter of Millions, approaching to the Prime of Youth, glow|ing with Health, Action and Vigour, of Beauty incomparable, beloved of All who knew him, and the Attraction and Admi|ration of every Eye where he pa&s;&s;ed. Yet all the&s;e Advantages, with all his higher
<PB N="244" REF="245">Accompli&s;hments, became as Matters of no Value, they &s;unk and &s;ickened to his Sen&s;e, while he felt a Void in his Bo&s;om, eager after he knew not what, &s;ighing he knew not why; keen and craving in his De&s;ires, yet pining and languid in the Want of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What is the Matter, my Love? &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> my dear Brother died in a good old Age. Such Things &s;hould be expect|ed, we know that they mu&s;t be, and we ought not to grieve as Per&s;ons who are without Hope.</P>
<P>True, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> and yet it is a very melancholy Thing for a poor Man to re|flect how very rich he was a very little while ago. I lately had a dear Brother, a dear Mother, and the deare&s;t of Fathers, but where are they All now? I look round the World and &s;ee nothing but your&s;elf therein. And &mdash; &s;hould you too &mdash; &s;hould you too &mdash; Here <HI>Harry</HI> could no more. His Uncle al&s;o broke into Tears, at the Thoughts of parting with his Dar|ling <HI>Harry,</HI> though it were to join his <HI>Loui&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he at la&s;t, we have yet two precious Trea&s;ures left upon Earth, if we did but know where to find them; it is your Cou&s;in the Counte&s;s of <HI>Maitland,</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="246">and the Brother of my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> the Marquis <HI>D'Aubigny.</HI> Let us go in Search of them, my Son. Next to my <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> they are the lovelie&s;t of all Living. They abound in all human and divine Affections, and will care&s;s us with kindred and corre&s;ponding Hearts.</P>
<P>Soon after, they &s;et out for <HI>France</HI> and, by a roundabout Tour of &s;hort but plea&s;ant Journeys, arrived at <HI>Paris,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Clin|ton</HI> ordered his large Retinue to his ancient Inn, and, taking only two Footmen, he and <HI>Harry</HI> went in their Po&s;t-Chai&s;e to the Marquis's Palace.</P>
<P>On the ringing of the Bell and the opening of the Gate, a &s;ingle Dome&s;tic came forth. Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> perceived that all was dark in the Hall, and this in&s;tantly gave an Alarm to his ever ready Feelings.</P>
<P>He alighted, however, and, &s;tepping with his <HI>Harry,</HI> up the Flight of Marble, Where is your Ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, where is my Brother the Marquis? Heaven ble&s;s us, cried the Fellow, are you my Ma&s;ter's Brother? I have heard a Deal of and about your Lord&s;hip, though I never was &s;o hap|py as to &s;ee your Face before. Ho! he continued, and rung another Bell, come All of You! attend the Brother of your
<PB N="246" REF="247">Lord, attend the pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter and Lord of your Hou&s;hold!</P>
<P>Immediately the Palace was in Commo|tion, the Parlour and Hall were lighted up, and All &s;eemed to have acquired a Set of Wings to their Motions.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> looked with Eagerne&s;s at Each of the Dome&s;tics, endeavouring to recollect the Features of &s;ome old Acquain|tance, but all the Faces were &s;trange to him. Pray tell me, my Friends, &s;ays he, where is your Ma&s;ter, where and how are he and his Lady, are they &s;till in good Health, has he had any Children by her?</P>
<P>Plea&s;e your Honour, &s;aid an elderly Man, my Ma&s;ter's fir&s;t Lady died of Child|birth, and her Infant peri&s;hed with her. But, he is &s;ince married to One of the love|lie&s;t Women in the World. He is gone, a Year &s;ince, on an Emba&s;&s;y into <HI>Africa;</HI> his Lady would not be left behind, we lately heard from them, they are Both in Health; and we expect that le&s;s than a Month will bring them &s;afe to us; indeed, the Sum of our Prayers is for their happy and &s;peedy Return.</P>
<P>What, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> are there none of my old Friends, not one of our ancient Dome&s;tics to the fore? &mdash; Plea&s;e your
<PB N="247" REF="248">Lord&s;hip, <HI>Jacome,</HI> the white headed Steward, is &s;till left, but, though in good Health, he is very little more than half alive. &mdash; Pray go and tell him that an old Friend of his is here, and would be very glad to &s;ee him, but don't do Things &s;uddenly, and be very tender and careful in bringing him to me.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Jacome</HI> was wheeled in, wrinkled, pale, and paralytic, and all enfeebled as he &s;at reclining in an ea&s;y Chair, he &s;eemed to recover Life and new Spirits, as they brought him forward. Bring me to him, bring me to him; my Eyes are wondrous dim; bring me clo&s;er, that I may know if it is my very Ma&s;ter indeed. Bring me but once to know that it is his &s;weet par|doning Face and then let me die with all my Sins upon me, I care not.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> then took him very lovingly by the Hand, my good Friend <HI>Jacome,</HI> &s;ays he, we are both growing old I find, I rejoice however to &s;ee you once more up|on Earth. O, cried the old Man, a well known and a &s;weet tuned Voice is that Voice; it is you then, it is you your&s;elf, my Ma&s;ter! Alas, for all your Lo&s;&s;es &s;ince la&s;t we parted! I have got a &s;alt Rheum in my Eyes of late, and I never thought of you but it began to come down.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249">
Here <HI>Jacome,</HI> &s;obbing aloud, provoked the joint Tears of his attending fellow Ser|vants; though they had never been Par|takers in the foregone Calamities, farther than by the Ear, whence they were now re|collected and carried home to their Hearts.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;ays <HI>Jacome</HI> at la&s;t, I am not the only One that remains of your old Ser|vants. Your <HI>Gerard</HI> too, who (Ble&s;&s;ings on his Hands) once tied me Neck and Heels, <HI>Gerard</HI> too is forthcoming and near at Hand. Your Honour's wonderful Bounty made a Gentlemen of him at once, and he is now in a high Way with a Wife and three Children. A hundred and a hundred Times have we wa&s;hed your Remembrance with our Tears. And indeed I think your Honour ought not to &s;end for him, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;uddenly die or run di&s;tracted at your Sight.</P>
<P>In the mean time, One of the Lacqueys had officiou&s;ly gone and informed <HI>Gerard</HI> of the Arrival of his Patron. He came panting, and ru&s;hed forward, as it were to ca&s;t him&s;elf at the Feet of his Lord. But &s;topping &s;uddenly, and drawing back &s;ome Steps, he nailed his Eyes, as it were, on the Face of Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and &s;preading his Hands, cried:</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="250">
You live then, my Lord, you &s;till live, my deare&s;t Ma&s;ter! you &s;urvive all your Deaths and Sufferings, and the Weight of ten Mountains has not been able to cru&s;h you! &mdash; O, the Times, the Times, my Ma&s;|ter, never more to return! &mdash; will there be &s;uch Times in Heaven, think you? &mdash; Will there be &s;uch Angels there as we once lived with upon Earth?</P>
<P>Here he clapped his Hands together, and &s;et up &s;uch a Shout of bitter Lamentation, as was enough to &s;plit the Heart of every Hearer, and, in a Manner, to &s;plit the Graves of the Per&s;ons whom he deplored.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> and his two old Friends had parted, for the Night: Tell me, my dear Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> are there different Kinds of Grief, or is it, merely, that Grief affects us in different Manners?</P>
<P>When I wept for my dear Father, my Mother and Brother, my Affliction was angui&s;hing and altogether bitter, without any Species of alleviating Sen&s;ation to com|pen&s;ate my Mi&s;ery. But, it was far other|wi&s;e with me to Night; when I grieved in the Grief of your old and faithful Do|me&s;tics, I felt my Heart breaking, but I was plea&s;ed that it &s;hould break; I felt that it was my Happine&s;s &s;o to grieve; and I
<PB N="250" REF="251">could wi&s;h a Return of the &s;ame &s;weet Sen|&s;ations.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on is this, my Love: When you lamented your Parents, you lamented Your&s;elf in your private and per&s;onal Lo&s;&s;es. Your Affliction was ju&s;t, it was natural, it was laudable. But &s;till it was confined, it participated but little of the Emotion that is excited by the Affliction of Others, and the Angui&s;h was the keener by being nearly limited to your own Bo&s;om and your own Concerns.</P>
<P>But, in the Griefs of my old and loving Servants, this Night; you became wholly expanded; you went beyond, you went out of your&s;elf. You felt, without Reflec|tion, how delightful it is to go forth, with your God, in his &s;ocial, generous, noble, and divine Sen&s;ibilities. And you delight|fully felt, my <HI>Harry,</HI> that &s;uch a Hou&s;e of Mourning is more joyous to your Soul, than all the Fe&s;tivals that Fle&s;h and Sen&s;e can open before you.</P>
<P>And now, my Child, I will finally, and once for all, lay open the very horrible and dete&s;table Nature of SELF in your Soul.</P>
<P>SELF appears to us, as the Whole of our Exi&s;tence, as the Sum total of All, in
<PB N="251" REF="252">which we are intere&s;ted or concerned. It is as a NARCISSUS, &s;elf-delighted, &s;elf-enamoured. It de&s;ires, it craves, and claims, as its Right, the Loves, Attach|ments, and Re&s;pects of all Mankind. But, does it acquire them, my <HI>Harry?</HI> O, ne|ver, never. SELF never was beloved, ne|ver will be beloved, never was honourable or re&s;pectable in the Eye of any Creature. And the Characters of the <HI>Patriot,</HI> the <HI>Hero,</HI> the <HI>Friend,</HI> and the <HI>Lover,</HI> are only &s;o far amiable, &s;o far revereable, as they are &s;up|po&s;ed to have gone forth from the Confines of SELF.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> propo&s;ed to wait the Re|turn of the Marquis, he employed the mean Sea&s;on in Endeavours to amu&s;e his Darling, and to di&s;pel the Cloud of Melancholy that continued to hang over him.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e, he went with him to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and to the many other elegant Environs of <HI>Paris.</HI> He al&s;o &s;hewed him the <HI>Thuilleries</HI> and other public Walks, where our Hero became oppre&s;&s;ed by his involuntary Attraction of all Eyes upon him.</P>
<P>One Night, happening to go to the Play, without the Company of his Guardian, as he came forth, with the Crowd, a Carriage
<PB N="252" REF="253">was opened for him which he took to be his own, and in he &s;tepped, and away he was taken.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> waited Supper for him, and began to grow un|ea&s;y when the Clock &s;truck Twelve. At la&s;t his Carriage and Servants returned with Tidings that they &s;taid for him, above an Hour, at the Theatre, after the Play was over, and had ever &s;ince been in Search of him, to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Though Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> was, by Nature, of an intrepid Spirit, and was &s;till more a&s;&s;ur|ed by his Reliance on Providence, he yet found him&s;elf agitated in a very alarming Manner. He therefore retired to his Clo|&s;et, and there, on his Knees, fervently commended his <HI>Harry</HI> to the Protection of his God.</P>
<P>At length the Clock &s;truck Three. Soon after, the Bell was heard from the Hall, and <HI>Harry,</HI> entering, with a Page in a rich Livery, flew like Lightening up Stairs, and ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Bo&s;om of his Pa|tron.</P>
<P>My Father, my Father! he cried, I have been in &s;ad Pannics for you. I knew the Love that you bore to your good for no|thing
<PB N="253" REF="254"><HI>Harry.</HI> But, indeed I could not help it. I could not get to you till this In&s;tant. I have been a Pri&s;oner, Sir, and here is my dear Deliverer.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were &s;omething com|po&s;ed, and All &s;eated; <HI>Harry</HI> proceeded to &s;atisfy the Impatience of his Uncle.</P>
<P>As I came out of the Theatre, ruminat|ing on a Pa&s;&s;age in one of <HI>Racine</HI>'s Trage|dies, I found a Chariot in the Spot where I had left my own, and &s;tepping heedle&s;ly into it, I was &s;oon &s;et down, and ha&s;tening through the great Hall, flew up Stairs to &s;alute you. But, think how I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed, when I &s;uddenly found my&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous Chamber, perhaps, in the Univer&s;e. It was wain&s;cotted with Mirrors of the mo&s;t perfect Poli&s;h, who&s;e Plates were artfully buttoned and buckled together by Diamonds and other Gems of a mo&s;t dazzling Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>All a&s;toni&s;hed, I recoiled, and was going to withdraw, when I was met by a Lady who followed and acco&s;ted me. Have you Commands, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, for any One in this Hou&s;e?&mdash;A thou&s;and Pardons, Ma|dam, I perceive my Error! I really thought I was &s;et down at my own Lodgings.&mdash;No great Offence, Sir, but now that I
<PB N="254" REF="255">look at you again, I think you ought to pay the Forfeit of your Intru&s;ion, by giving me one Hour of your Company, at lea&s;t.&mdash;You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Madam, my Guardian would be under the mo&s;t terrify|ing Alarms for me.&mdash;A Fig for Guar|dians, &s;he cried, You are now my Pri&s;oner, and nothing le&s;s than my Friend <HI>Lewis,</HI> with his Army at his Back, &s;hall be able to take you out of my Hands.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he rung a Bell, and, imme|diately a folding Door of pannelled looking-Gla&s;s flew open, and &s;hewed us to another Apartment, where a Supper, compo&s;ed of all the Elegancies of the Sea&s;on, was &s;erved up, as by Magic, and lay fuming on the Table.</P>
<P>She then took me by the Hand and, having graciou&s;ly &s;eated me, placed her|&s;elf oppo&s;ite. A Number of Servants then vani&s;hed, on the In&s;tant, leaving a dumb Waiter of Silver behind them.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, we are not to have any further Company. You alone were ex|pected, you alone are de&s;ired, All Others are forbidden. In &s;hort, I have &s;een you often at the public Walks and Theatres. You did more than &s;trike my Fancy, you laid hold on my Heart. I enquired every Thing about you. I know your Rank,
<PB N="255" REF="256">Title and Fortune. I made u&s;e of this Night's Stratagem to decoy you to me, and, though there are few Women, in <HI>Europe,</HI> of equal Opulence or Dignity, I think I cannot much demean my&s;elf by an Alliance with a &s;weet Fellow whom I &s;o ar|dently love. But come, our Supper cools.</P>
<P>I gazed at her with Admiration. She was indeed the mo&s;t fini&s;hed Beauty I ever beheld. And I was inwardly flattered, and in a Manner attached to her by her Partia|lity in my Favour.</P>
<P>After Supper, and &s;ome futile and in&s;ig|nificant Chat, &s;he drew her Chair nearer to me. What &s;ay you, my Lord, &s;ays &s;he, fondly, am I to live, or to peri&s;h?</P>
<P>Ah Madam, I cried, Love is, as a little Bird, if you cage it, it will beat it&s;elf to Pieces again&s;t its Pri&s;on. Not that I re|gard your late Threats of Confinement; my own Arm is at all Times &s;ufficient to deliver me from your Thraldom; but, in Truth, I am partly become a willing Pri|&s;oner to You; and Time may, po&s;&s;ibly, reconcile me to your different Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>What Cu&s;toms, I pray you? Why, Madam, the Ladies, in my Country, u&s;e no Paint, except the Rouge of Nature's
<PB N="256" REF="257">Blu&s;h and the Palene&s;s of Cha&s;tity. Love al&s;o, in <HI>England,</HI> is a Kind of Warfare be|tween the Sexes, ju&s;t &s;uch as once happen|ed between the <HI>Parthians</HI> and old <HI>Rome;</HI> our Ladies conquer, by flying, and our Men are vanqui&s;hed while they pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons, Sir, of a certain Rank, &s;aid &s;he, are di&s;pen&s;ed with from conforming to little Matters of Decorum. However, if you will endeavour to adopt the Manners of my Country, I will do my be&s;t, on my Part, to conform to tho&s;e of Yours.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he looked langui&s;hingly at me, and drew her Chair quite clo&s;e; when, by an involuntary Motion, I put mine further back. Don't be alarmed, my Lord, &s;ays &s;he, Women of my Condition know always where to &s;top. Right, Madam, &s;aid I, but po&s;&s;ibly you might not be quite &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful in teaching me where to be &s;topped.</P>
<P>Cold con&s;titutioned Boy! &s;he cried (in|dignantly ri&s;ing and colouring) your Bed lies yonder, you may go to it, if you like, and ruminate till Morning on the Danger of &s;lighting and in&s;ulting a Prince&s;s. So &s;aying, &s;he &s;wept haughtily out of the Room, and locked me in.</P>
<P>During an Hour after &s;he had withdrawn, while I walked about, con&s;idering what I
<PB N="257" REF="258">had to apprehend from the Threats of this extraordinary Woman, I hear'd a great Bu&s;tling in and about the Falace; but, within another Hour All was quiet and &s;till again.</P>
<P>I then conceived Thoughts of attempting my E&s;cape. But again, I held it beneath me to be caught in the Manner; and &s;o I re&s;olved to wait till Morning, and then to force my Pa&s;&s;age through her Guards in open Day.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, I imagined that a Pannel in the Wain&s;cot &s;tirred. And, &s;oon after, it was removed, and my young Friend, here, entered my Chamber on Tiptoe. He beckoned me to Silence and, taking me by the Hand, he led me through the Way by which he came.</P>
<P>We then de&s;cended a narrow Pair of back Stairs, and, groping along a dark Entry, he cautiou&s;ly unbolted a Door that opened into a Garden; and hurrying with me, acro&s;s, he unlocked another Door that opened to the Street, and out we got, re|joicing!</P>
<P>Soon after, we met a Party of the Guards, who were patroling the Streets, and, putting a few Pieces into their Hand,

<P>My Lords, &s;aid <HI>Perr&egrave;,</HI> (for that was the Page's Name) it would be extremely dange|rous for Ye to remain another Day, or even till Morning in <HI>Paris.</HI> The Prince&s;s is the mo&s;t intimate Friend of Madame <HI>Mainte|non,</HI> and through her can do what &s;he plea&s;es with the King. During my Re&s;i|dence with her, &s;he grew tired of two hand|&s;ome Lovers, in Succe&s;&s;ion; but they told no Tales; and no One can yet tell what became of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> was quite of <HI>Perr&egrave;</HI>'s Opi|nion. He in&s;tantly &s;ent for his People. All was Hurry, Pack and Di&s;patch, and, toward Dawning, they &s;et out on a Road that led to the Cantons. But, changing their Cour&s;e again, for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Mornings, they arrived at <HI>Calais</HI> by a long Tour of near five Weeks travel.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> &s;et up at his old Inn, and after Dinner, the Ho&s;t entered to pay his Compliments. Have you any News, Land|lord? Nothing at pre&s;ent, my Lord, all is quiet again. But here has been a fearful Bu&s;tle about three Weeks ago. The King's Army came down, in Pur&s;uit of young <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> who ran away with a La|dy
<PB N="259" REF="260">of Quality from <HI>Paris.</HI> For my Share, continued he, looking earne&s;tly at <HI>Harry,</HI> I fear that You, pretty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lads, will hardly leave us a lovely Wench in the Na|tion. <HI>Harry</HI> looked quite &s;ecure, being wholly innocent of any pre&s;ent De&s;ign on the Sex; but poor little <HI>Perr&egrave;</HI> turned as pale as the Table Cloth.</P>
<P>I remember, continued our talkative Ho&s;t, that ju&s;t &s;uch another Affair hap|pened, when I was a Boy and Servant in this Hou&s;e. Here came a young <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> ju&s;t &s;uch another &s;weet Fellow as this before me; and he brought with him an Angel of a Creature, the like of whom my Eyes never did, nor ever &s;hall open upon till they clo&s;e in Death. After him came one of our great Dukes, with a Party of the King's Army, and terrible Things were expected. But, they made it up in a Manner I know not how. And my Lord <HI>Anglois</HI> carried off his Prize in Triumph! Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> &s;tooped his Head, and dropt a &s;ilent Tear, but held no further Conver&s;e with our Landlord on the Subject.</P>
<P>That Evening, a Gale &s;prung up and, going on Board, they were &s;afe anchored, before Morning, in the Bay of <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>They then mutually embraced; and <HI>Harry,</HI> catching his beloved Deliverer to
<PB N="260" REF="261">his Bo&s;om, we are now upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground, &s;ays he; welcome to my Arms, my dear <HI>Perr&egrave;,</HI> no longer my Page or Ser|vant, but my Friend and my Brother! You can't conceive what Pain your Offici|ou&s;ne&s;s has hitherto co&s;t me, but, there mu&s;t be no more of this; You &s;hall here|after be &s;erved and attended as I am, nay, I my&s;elf will gladly &s;erve You to the utmo&s;t of my Power and the Extent of my For|tune.</P>
<P>Ah, my Lord, cried the lovely <HI>Perr&egrave;,</HI> gently falling at the Feet of his Ma&s;ter, if you deprive me of the Plea&s;ure of &s;erving You, you deprive me of all the Plea&s;ure that the World can afford me. If you knew the Delight I find in being always about you, in watching your Thoughts and Motions, in looking into your fine Eyes and there reading your De&s;ires, before they ri&s;e to Expre&s;&s;ion, You could not find in your Heart to deprive me of &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;|ing. Well then, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> rai&s;ing him fondly in his Arms, our future Conte&s;t &s;hall be, which of us &s;hall &s;erve the Other with mo&s;t Affection and Sedulity.</P>
<P>After Dinner, the Evening being calm and &s;hiny, <HI>Harry</HI> took his <HI>Perr&egrave;</HI> with him along the Shore that &s;tretches under the &s;tupendous Cliffs of <HI>Dover.</HI> They had not
<PB N="261" REF="262">walked far when, getting out of the Sight of People within the Winding of a Creek, a Man advanced toward them, and, taking out a Pi&s;tol, called to <HI>Harry,</HI> and ordered him to throw down his Pur&s;e. Our Hero did not regard his Pur&s;e, but, thinking it an Indignity to be robbed by one Man, he put his Hand to his Sword. Hereupon, the Villain cocked and levelled his Pi&s;tol, and the faithful <HI>Perr&egrave;,</HI> ob&s;erving that he was going to fire, in&s;tantly jumped in be|tween her Ma&s;ter and Danger and received the Ball into her own lovely Bo&s;om.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> &s;aw his Darling drop, and, flying all enraged at the Robber, he ran him thrice through the Body and pinned him to the Ground. Then, flying as &s;wiftly back, he threw him&s;elf by the Side of his dying <HI>Perr&egrave;,</HI> and gently rai&s;ing her lan|gui&s;hing Head, placed it fondly on his Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>You are wounded, my Friend, dange|rou&s;ly wounded I fear, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI> Yes, my Lord, I am wounded ju&s;t as I could wi&s;h; and I would not exchange my pre|ent ble&s;&s;ed Death for the longe&s;t and hap|pie&s;t Life that the World could be&s;tow.&mdash;But, it is Time to undeceive, and eveal a Secret to you, which nothing but death &s;hould ever have extorted from me
<PB N="262" REF="263">&mdash;I am not what I &s;eem, my mo&s;t beloved Ma&s;ter!&mdash;I am a fooli&s;h and fond Girl who, at the fir&s;t Glance, con|ceived a Pa&s;&s;ion for you.&mdash;My Name is <HI>Maria de Lau&s;anne;</HI>&mdash;I am Niece to that bad Woman whom you ju&s;tly rejected.&mdash;But, what did I propo&s;e by this Di&s;|gui&s;e? Fir&s;t your Deliverance, my Lord, and that I effected.&mdash;But, did I fur|ther a&s;pire to the Honour of your Hand? Far from it, far from it&mdash;I felt my own Unworthine&s;s, I did not think you could be mated by any Thing le&s;s than an An|gel&mdash;But then to &s;ee you, to hear you, to &s;erve, to touch, to be near you, to fix my Eyes on you unheeded, and, if po&s;&s;i|ble, to win your Attention by the little Offices of my Fondne&s;s, this was my Hap|pine&s;s, the Whole of the Heaven that I propo&s;ed upon Earth&mdash;I have had it, I have enjoyed it;&mdash;and I ought to die content&mdash;But, alas, to part from you, there is the Pang of Pangs.&mdash;O, if this Day merits any Thing, by the Offer of my own Life for the Pre&s;ervation of my Beloved.&mdash;Then cau&s;e my cha&s;te Clay to be kindly depo&s;ited in the Tomb of your Ance&s;tors&mdash;that&mdash;when Time &s;hall come&mdash;my Du&s;t may be neigh boured&mdash;to your precious Du&s;t&mdash;and there &s;leep in Peace&mdash;be&s;ide you&mdash;till we &s;pring&mdash;together&mdash;from
<PB N="263" REF="264">Corruption&mdash;into Glory and Immor|tality!</P>
<P>During the&s;e &s;hort Sentences and diffi|cult Re&s;pirations, <HI>Harry</HI> could an&s;wer no|thing&mdash;He was &s;uffocated by his Grief.&mdash;But, putting his &s;peechle&s;s Lips to the fading Lips of his <HI>Maria,</HI> he drew her late&s;t Breath into his own affecti|onate Bo&s;om, and Angels in&s;tantly caught her Spirit into the Regions of Purity, of Love, and of Faith unfailing!</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> then, plucking up Strength from Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Courage from De&s;pair, pre&s;&s;ed his Lips to the pale, and unfeeling Lips of his true Lover, and cried, Yes, my <HI>Maria,</HI> our Du&s;t &s;hall be joined, and I feel that our Spirits too &s;hall &s;hortly be wed|ded!&mdash;Then, rai&s;ing her in his Arms, and pre&s;&s;ing her to his Bo&s;om, he bore her to the Town, while he poured upon her, all the Way, the two Fountains of his Af|fection.</P>
<P>When he got to the Inn, and came to is Uncle; Here, Sir, &s;aid he, I pre&s;ent you with a very precious little Burden, a Bur|den that lies much heavier on my Heart than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> did in my Arms. He then related to Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> the Whole of what had pa&s;&s;ed; then, heavily &s;ighing, and &s;hedding a Tear, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> cried, Ah, my <HI>Harry,</HI> I would
<PB N="264" REF="265">to Heaven that your <HI>Maria</HI> had lived, She exceeds your <HI>Aggy Je&s;&s;amin</HI> all to nothing.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> ordered a Carriage, on Purpo&s;e, for him&s;elf and his Beloved. She was depo&s;ited in a Coffin hurried up for the Oc|ca&s;ion; and, notwith&s;tanding all the Re|mon&s;trances and Entreaties of his Parent, <HI>Harry</HI> proved a Rebel, for the fir&s;t Time, and would not be divided from his <HI>Maria,</HI> till they reached <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>There, our Hero ordered a Coffin of unallayed and beaten Silver to be prepared for her Reception. And, tho' near five Days had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Departure of her Spirit, her cha&s;te Fle&s;h remained as pure and untainted, as that of a Lamb newly &s;lain.</P>
<P>While they were putting her into her &s;olemn Repo&s;itory. Ah, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> I pretend not to compare with you, your Lo&s;&s;es, I own, have been greater than mine. You are a Man, like your divine Ma&s;ter, wholly made up of Sorrows and acquainted with killing Griefs. But &s;till you mu&s;t allow that, for my little Time I have had a competent Share. It matter not. I am reconciled to them. I begin to be plea&s;ed with them. And indeed Joy is become my utter Aver&s;ion, while I think
<PB N="265" REF="266">on this loved Creature, who willingly bled and died for my Sake.</P>
<P>As <HI>Harry</HI> thought it his Duty, &s;o he thought it would be his Delight to weep and lament his <HI>Maria</HI> for ever. But Pa&s;|&s;ions &s;eldom are permanent, and Time, though it may not wholly efface, daily wears away an in&s;en&s;ible Portion of the deepe&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> cau&s;ed the Coffin of his Deliverer to be exalted on a Cabinet in his Bedcham|ber, that it might be always in his Sight. But the Familiarity of affecting Objects daily le&s;&s;ens their Force; and <HI>Harry,</HI> Week after Week, began to contemplate the Repo&s;itory of the loved Remains of his <HI>Maria,</HI> with abating Affliction.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> received a Letter, by the <HI>French</HI> Mail, in an&s;wer to One which he had left for his Brother-in|law, at <HI>Paris.</HI> And, this Letter informed him, under the Marquis's Hand, that he had returned from his Amba&s;&s;y to the Court of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and that he and his Lady would be &s;hortly in <HI>England.</HI> And, at the Bot|tom he found written, in a different Charac|ter, <HI>Will it be any Satisfaction to &s;ee them ac|companied by your once loved</HI>&mdash;FANNY GOODALL.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">
We have found them, my <HI>Harry,</HI> he cried, we have found them, our long and far &s;ought Friends; the two Trea&s;ures which our God had graciou&s;ly laid in Store, for the Comfort of us poor People who lo&s;t All be&s;ide. But, don't let us do them the Di&s;grace, my Son, of meeting and receiv|ing them with Tears and Dirges. Let me then prevail upon you to permit your faith|ful <HI>Perr&egrave;</HI> to be conducted by &s;ome of our People, with an honourable Train of Un|dertakers to <HI>Enfield,</HI> and there to be trea|&s;ured up in your Family Vault, where I &s;hall &s;peedily join her, and whereto even my <HI>Harry</HI> mu&s;t finally adjourn.&mdash;<HI>Harry</HI> wiped his Eye and &s;aid, be it as you plea&s;e, my Father!</P>
<P>Within the following Fortnight, as our Hero &s;tood with a &s;ingle Attendant in <HI>Cheap|&s;ide</HI> overagain&s;t the <HI>Devil Tavern,</HI> where the Club, called <HI>Legion Club,</HI> was kept; he was acco&s;ted by a glittering Appearance, who took him by the Hand and &s;aid, How are you, Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton?</HI>&mdash;Well, Sir, I thank you; Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> I pre&s;ume!&mdash;The &s;ame, Sir&mdash;And pray how are the worthy Lord and Lady <HI>Mansfield,</HI> as al&s;o your lovely Si&s;ter, the Lady <HI>Loui&s;a?</HI>&mdash;Pa&s;&s;able, Sir; but what makes you in black? I hope Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> is &s;till in the Land of the Living.&mdash;He is, my Lord.
<PB N="267" REF="268">But Black is a cheap Kind of Wear, it is a Matter of Frugality to kill a Cou&s;in once in a Twelve-month.&mdash;Well, be that as it may, I in&s;i&s;t on your &s;tepping over the Way to take one Gla&s;s with me&mdash;Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t excu&s;e me, I am go|ing to the Wharf, to enquire concerning &s;ome Friends whom I expect from <HI>France.</HI> O, I prote&s;t, Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> you &s;hall not di&s;appoint me, I in&s;i&s;t on renewing our old Acquaintance.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> could hardly have found it in his Heart to refu&s;e the Reque&s;t of an avowed Enemy, much le&s;s could he think of re|jecting an Invitation that was made under a warm Appearance of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>When Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> had &s;eated his old Enemy (as he &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed him to be) in the Mid&s;t of fourteen or fifteen Bloods and Bucks, <HI>Harry</HI> would gladly have retreated; but rejected the Thought, le&s;t they &s;hould think that he was intimidated.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, cried Lord <HI>Bottom,</HI> give me Leave to introduce a Phenomenon to you, my Friend yonder is a CHRISTIAN! A Chri&s;tian, cried One; a Chri&s;tian, cried Another? Ay, &s;aid Lord <HI>Bottom,</HI> a Chri&s;|tian of the right Ca&s;t, he literally conforms to the Example of his Ma&s;ter. If you
<PB N="268" REF="269">&s;mite him on the one Cheek, he will turn the Other to you, and you cannot delight him more than by Kickings, Spittings, and Spurnings.</P>
<P>Pray Sir, &s;aid One of the Company, are you actually a Chri&s;tian? I hope &s;o, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry.</HI> And may I &s;pit in your Face, Sir, &s;aid Another, without Fear of Cha&s;|ti&s;ement? You may, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>I told ye &s;o, Gentlemen, I told ye &s;o, exclaimed Lord <HI>Bottom.</HI> I have my&s;elf put the Chri&s;tianity of my Friend there to the Proof. I have made him the But and the Je&s;t of all Companies. I have dubbed him with the Title of FOOL. I have pa&s;ted it on his Back in Capitals, in the Mid&s;t of the Levee, and in the Pre&s;ence of his Ma|je&s;ty. And yet, he never &s;hewed the lea&s;t In&s;tance of his being offended. For Ex|ample now, and &s;o &s;aying, he &s;pit directly in <HI>Harry</HI>'s Face.</P>
<P>Another then, and then Another, and &s;o on, in a numerous Succe&s;&s;ion &s;pit full at our Hero. While he, without the &s;malle&s;t apparent Emotion, barely took out his Handkerchief and wiped the Moi&s;ture from his Face.</P>
<P>At rength a lu&s;ty-looking young Man arore Damn the Ra&s;cal, &s;aid he, I will
<PB N="269" REF="270">not demean my&s;elf by &s;pitting at him, I will pi&s;s upon the Ra&s;cal; which he accord|ingly prepared to do. But <HI>Harry,</HI> perceiv|ing his Approach, turned mildly and &s;aid, I do not recollect, Sir, that this was any of the Indignities to which my Lord and Ma&s;ter &s;ubmitted. Then, without ri&s;ing from his Seat, he gave him a Knuckle in the Temple which laid him a&s;leep on the Floor.</P>
<P>'Sbl&mdash;d, cried One of the Company, I fear, <HI>Jemmy Bottom,</HI> you have brought us into the wrong Box. You have certainly mi&s;taken your Man.</P>
<P>He has indeed, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> calmly. He calls me <HI>Fenton,</HI> but my Name is not <HI>Fenton,</HI> my Name is <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>More|land;</HI> and you &s;hall, every Man, lie the&s;e twelve Months in <HI>Newgate</HI> for this Day's Breach of Privilege again&s;t a Peer of the Realm. Here is my Star, Gentlemen; I can put my Riband on at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The whole <HI>Legion</HI> were in&s;tantly &s;truck with mute Terror and A&s;toni&s;hment. They lifted up their Hands, or &s;unk to their Knees in petitioning Po&s;tures. But <HI>Harry</HI> &s;aid, with a firm and alarming Ac|cent, I de&s;ire your Reformation, Gentle|men, and I will endeavour to compleat it.
<PB N="270" REF="271">I have hitherto, only &s;hewn you the fir&s;t Part of Chri&s;tianity in the Example of meek and lowly Sufferance. The &s;econd Part remains. It is to teach You, abject Wretches, to &s;uffer in your Turn. How|ever, I am not of a very vindictive Na|ture, and if All of you will be upon Ho|nour to give me your Hands, I will par|don what is pa&s;t and di&s;mi&s;s you in Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> and his Friend <HI>Rakely</HI> were the fir&s;t who advanced, lowly bowing, to claim the propo&s;ed Terms of Peace, when <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;eizing <HI>Bottom</HI>'s Hand with a &s;trong and agile Gripe, cru&s;hed the Bones and the Gri&s;les as it were into one Ma&s;s, and <HI>Bot|tom,</HI> giving a huge Scream, dropt roaring on the Floor. <HI>Rakely</HI> then would have re|coiled, but <HI>Harry,</HI> catching at him, &s;ent him to join his Brother in Iniquity and Affliction on the Boards.</P>
<P>Well, Gentlemen, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> what keeps you in your Seats? Why do ye not come and give me the Honour of your Hands as was agreed? If you do not do it directly, I will take Each of you, very quietly, by the No&s;e, and kick you through the Crowd of Attendants down Stairs.</P>
<P>My Lord, cried One of the Company, I will not give you my Hand, neither &s;hall
<PB N="271" REF="272">any Man living take me by the No&s;e. So &s;aying he &s;prung up, and catching at his Sword, which lay with Others on a Table, he ha&s;tily drew it and &s;tood on his Defence.</P>
<P>O fye, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> without moving from his Seat, you don't put your&s;elf in a Po&s;ture. Any Man, who was not a very good natured Man, might take you at an Advantage, and run you under the Open that you give to your right Flank. But Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> ri&s;ing, I will only caution you by a little Puncture in the Sword Arm; I don't mean you much Hurt. And, &s;o &s;aying, he pa&s;&s;ed his Sword through the Fle&s;h of his Adver&s;ary's right Arm, and, taking him to the Door, he wi&s;hed him a good Evening, and turned him down Stairs to &s;eek for a Surgeon.</P>
<P>He then returned to the Company, and, taking Each of the intimidated Wretches (in Succe&s;&s;ion) by the No&s;e; he led them out, and footed them down Stairs, through the Mid&s;t of their own Servants, the Wait|ers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> crying, a Kicking to all the infa|mous and &s;coundrel Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> who dare to &s;pit at Chri&s;tianity!</P>
<P>Then, calling two of the Drawers, Here is &s;omething for your&s;elves, my Lads, &s;ays he; and here I leave you yonder Swords and the&s;e two very fine Gentlemen in pawn
<PB N="272" REF="273">for your Reckoning. So &s;aying, he walk|ed quite compo&s;edly away, through the Mid&s;t of two long Ranges of bowing Ad|mirers, who lined the Stairs and the Entry, and thus <HI>Harry</HI> di&s;&s;olved the <HI>Legion Club.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning early before Mr. <HI>Clin|ton</HI> was up, while <HI>Harry</HI> &s;at &s;ipping a Di&s;h of Tea, dre&s;&s;ed in a dark grey Frock, his Hair &s;lightly bound up after the Footman Fa&s;hion, and his long Staff of quarter cleft Oak, without Knot or Flaw, &s;tanding po|li&s;hed be&s;ide him, Mr. <HI>Frank</HI> introduced a young Man, whom he recommended to his Lord&s;hip's Service.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> mea&s;ured him, with a Glance, from Top to Toe, and was in&s;tantly &s;truck by the vi&s;ible Action, Power, and Energy of his Proportions.</P>
<P>Sit down, <HI>Frank,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> while your Friend and I treat. What is your Name, my Lad? <HI>John Sutton,</HI> &s;o plea&s;e you. And what Wages do you de&s;ire?

But if I &s;hould have the Misfor|tune to love you, as your Countenance threatens, I &s;hall certainly de&s;erve the
<PB N="273" REF="274">whole of my Demand, by All that I &s;hall do, and dare to do in your Service.</P>
<P>Can you wre&s;tle, <HI>Jack?</HI> &mdash; When|ever your Honour &s;hall get a Man, through the Shires of <HI>England,</HI> who is able to fling me, I will &s;erve you the Remainder of my Life for nothing. Can you cudgel, <HI>Jack?</HI> &mdash; I was born a Fencer, &s;o plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip, my Father was a famous Prize|fighter, and my Mother could beat my Father him&s;elf at the Quarter Staff. &mdash; Did you ever read the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Robin Hood, Jack?</HI> &mdash; I did, Sir. &mdash; Then you may remember that hone&s;t <HI>Robin</HI> never took an Abettor into Pay, &s;ave &s;uch a One as was able to cope with him&s;elf. <HI>Frank</HI> here &s;hall &s;it and &s;ee fair Play.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then ro&s;e, and taking two Sticks, gave one of them to his Opponent, then, putting a Bra&s;s Helmet upon <HI>Jack</HI>'s Head, there is &s;omething, &s;aid he, to &s;ave you from Hurt, and now, come at the Thick|ne&s;s of my Skull as fa&s;t as you can!</P>
<P>To it they &s;trait fell, with equal Confi|dence of Ability. But <HI>Harry,</HI> perceiving that <HI>Jack</HI> intended to &s;pare him, cried, Come, <HI>Jack,</HI> the be&s;t, the very be&s;t that you can do, or not a Penny, a &s;ingle Penny of Wages, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="275">
<HI>Jack</HI> then exerted his utmo&s;t, and put nearly the fulle&s;t Powers of our Hero to Proof, till <HI>Harry,</HI> dazzling his Eyes by a &s;udden Flouri&s;h, gave him a &s;mart Stroke on his brazen Head-piece, and drove him &s;tunned and &s;taggering &s;everal Paces back|ward, till he re&s;ted again&s;t the Wall that &s;tood behind him.</P>
<P>Ha, &s;aid <HI>Jack,</HI> recovering, and ca&s;ting his Cap a&s;ide, that indeed was a Blow which neither my Father nor Mother ever taught me to fence.</P>
<P>Well, my Friend, &s;aid our Hero, as &s;oon as you are re&s;ted, we mu&s;t have a little Turn or &s;o at Wre&s;tling.

Well, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> a Fling on this Floor can't hurt us a Whit more than a Fall on the Downs.</P>
<P>They clo&s;ed, they grappled, they griped under and over, at Hip and at Shoulder, alternately lifting and lifted, till they were nearly overbreathed.

<P>When Breakfa&s;t was over, <HI>Harry</HI> looked fixedly at his late Opponent and &s;aid, I will give you, <HI>Jack,</HI> a little Matter above the Extent of your Demand; I will give you one Hundred a Year for your Cudgelling, another Hundred for your Wre&s;tling; and as you &s;ay you can love, I will lay another Hundred in &s;tore for you, till that Pro|mi&s;e is put to Proof; and here is twenty Guineas as Earne&s;t of our Agreement. <HI>Jack</HI> then threw him&s;elf pro&s;trate before the Feet of his new Ma&s;ter. Keep your Bounties, keep your Bounties for my Ex|ecutors, he cried, for I feel that, when your Service demands my Life, I &s;hall not &s;urvive another Minute.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then ro&s;e and, putting another Quarter-&s;taff into the Hand of his new Ser|vant,
<PB N="276" REF="277">here is a Hor&s;e for you, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays he, in ca&s;e you &s;hould tire; for we have a long Walk from Pal-Mall here, to the Cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e Wharf and back again.</P>
<P>As they drew near the Quay, <HI>Harry</HI> ob|&s;erved a great Crowd, all in Motion, and &s;houting as in the Mid&s;t of an Affray. Im|mediately he ha&s;tened up, and, making way through the Mob, perceived that they were kicking, and wounding, and drag|ging above twenty unhappy Foreigners along the Pavement. While a Lady, who &s;tood with her Women on the Stairs, cried aloud, five hundred, a thou&s;and, five thou|&s;and Pounds to Any who will &s;ave my poor People!</P>
<P>Come, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays our Hero, let us try to deliver the&s;e abu&s;ed Strangers from the Cruelty of our &s;avage Countrymen.</P>
<P>On the Word, <HI>Harry</HI> found him&s;elf well &s;econded by <HI>Jack,</HI> and, in le&s;s than a Mi|nute, above thirty of the A&s;&s;ailants lay &s;prawling on the Area; while the wounded and brui&s;ed Foreigners aro&s;e as well as they could, or crawled and got in a Group to the Feet of their Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Mob, thereupon, rallied, and, ga|thering to the Number of &s;ome Hundreds,
<PB N="277" REF="278">advanced in a formidable Body again&s;t our two Champions. But, they had better have kept aloof. For <HI>Harry,</HI> running up|on them, overturned the Fir&s;t he met with one End of his Staff, and laid a Second at his Feet with the Revolution of the other End, in&s;omuch that at every Motion, as it were, he di&s;patched two Men.</P>
<P>Neither was <HI>Jack</HI> unactive. The Crowd began to recoil, when, ru&s;hing into the Mid&s;t, they overthrew &s;uch as oppo&s;ed them, and, whirling their Staffs about their Heads, they quickly opened and cleared large Room for them&s;elves. No One dared to abide within the Wind of their Wea|pons; and the Mob, flying &s;everal Ways, left our Hero quiet Ma&s;ter of the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>Mean time, the Lady &s;tood fixed in utter A&s;toni&s;hment at the Feats which &s;he had &s;een, when <HI>Harry,</HI> gracefully approach|ing, I think my&s;elf happy, Madam, &s;ays he, in having done &s;ome &s;mall Service to a Lady of your fair and noble Appearance; of what Country may I pre&s;ume? Of <HI>England,</HI> Sir, &s;ays &s;he, and I am ready to di&s;charge my Promi&s;e of five thou&s;and Pounds for the gallant Re&s;cue which you brought to me and my People.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="279">
No, Madam, &s;aid our Hero, I will not de|ba&s;e the little Merit of my Humanity by the Acceptance of a Bribe. But I &s;hall not be ea&s;y till I &s;ee You and your Attendants out of the Reach of the&s;e <HI>London</HI>-Barbari|ans. They may return with different Wea|pons, and a larger Reinforcement. He then called to &s;ome Porters and, throwing them a Parcel of Silver, ordered them to bring all the Coaches they could mu&s;ter. And go You, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays he, to the Ship|ping, enquire after the Friends that I told you of, and then follow me to the White Cro&s;s Tavern in <HI>Cheap&s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>The Coaches came, and <HI>Harry</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Porters in carrying, helping, and gently &s;towing the Maimed and the Wounded into half a Dozen of them. He then hand|ed in the Lady, and next, coming to a Blackamoor Boy, who had a Coronet of Diamonds in&s;erted in his Cap, he offered to lift him in. But the Youth, bending one Knee to the Du&s;t, and &s;eizing on <HI>Harry</HI>'s Hand, eagerly and repeatedly ki&s;&s;ed it, crying out in <HI>French,</HI> heavenly, heavenly Creature! and then, breaking into Tears, &s;prung into the Coach, and &s;at down by the Lady.</P>
<P>Our Hero then be&s;towed the four female Attendants, with &s;uch Luggage as was
<PB N="279" REF="280">brought on Shore, into the four remaining Coaches. Then, gra&s;ping his Quarter&s;taff, and ordering the Porters to attend, he guarded and e&s;corted All &s;afe to the White Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing he then did was to or|der private Apartments for the Lady and her Attendants. He next di&s;patched the Wait|ers for all the Surgeons in the Neighbour|hood. He then locked the Room where he &s;aw the Luggage &s;afe lodged; ordered a &s;umptuous Dinner to be prepared as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and, la&s;tly, di&s;charged the Coaches and Porters, who poured their parting Ble&s;&s;ings upon his Head; and all this he did with wonderful Di&s;patch, for <HI>Harry</HI> was now in the wide Element of his Bene|ficence, as a Whale in the Ocean.</P>
<P>Four Surgeons then came, and our Hero, putting five Guineas apiece into their Hands, de&s;ired them to examine and dre&s;s their Patients; and &s;taid till he hear'd the delighting Tidings that None of them were incurable. He then &s;ent up to the Lady to de&s;ire Permi&s;&s;ion to attend her. She ro&s;e and met him as he entered; Child of Heaven, &s;aid &s;he, from which of the Or|ders of Angels have you de&s;cended? I have heared as well as &s;een what you have won|derfully done for us. Madam, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> endeavouring to turn the Di&s;cour&s;e, I
<PB N="280" REF="281">would not advi&s;e you to remove your Peo|ple for &s;ome Time: I have ordered Beds and Apartments for them in this Hou&s;e; where tho&s;e, who are tolerably well, may a&s;&s;i&s;t the Doctors to attend their &s;ick Fellows till All &s;hall be re&s;tored. In the mean time I have &s;ent to my Father's for his Coach and Chariot to convey You, and this young Gentleman, and your Women, to our Hou&s;e, where you can want for no Ser|vants, &s;ince my Father, and I, and All will be truely and tenderly your Servants. We are your Property, Sir, &s;aid the Lady, di&s;|po&s;e of us as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But, pray Madam, &s;aid our Hero, what could provoke the Rabble to in&s;ult You and Yours, in the Manner that they did this Day? I prote&s;t, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I cannot conceive, except it be that, as &s;ome One &s;ays in LEAR, <HI>our Countenances liked them not.</HI></P>
<P>In a little Time after, Dinner was &s;erved up, and <HI>Harry,</HI> happening to turn his Head, perceived the black Youth by &s;tealth ki&s;&s;ing the Hat, and pre&s;&s;ing the Gloves to his Bo&s;om that he had laid on a Table.</P>
<P>Whatever the Darkne&s;s or Deformity of any A&s;pect or Per&s;on may happen to be, if the &s;entimental Beauty of Soul &s;hall bur&s;t through the Cloud upon us, the Dark be|comes
<PB N="281" REF="282">Light, the Deformed quite comely, and we begin to affect what was lately our Aver&s;ion. Thus it was that <HI>Harry</HI> found him&s;elf &s;uddenly and inevitably attached by the two recent Proofs that this outlandi&s;h Youth had given of his Affection.</P>
<P>Being all &s;eated, <HI>Harry</HI> looked earne&s;tly at the young Moor, and turning to the Lady &s;aid: I now perceive, Madam, how ridiculous all Sorts of Prejudices are, and find that Time and Ob&s;ervation may change our Opinions to the Rever&s;e of what they were. I once had an Aver&s;ion to all Sorts of Blacks, but I avow that there is &s;omething &s;o amiable in the Face of this Youth, and his Eyes ca&s;t &s;uch a Lu&s;tre over the Darkne&s;s of his Countenance as is enough, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has it, to make us in love with Night, and pay no more Wor|&s;hip to the gaudy Sun.</P>
<P>The Moor, hereat, &s;miled cele&s;tial Sweetne&s;s, and Joy beamed from his Eyes and throughout his dimpling A&s;pect.</P>
<P>But who can you be, my &s;weet Fellow, &s;aid the Lady, who are the Picture, the Image, almo&s;t the Thing it&s;elf that I was &s;o &s;adly in love with five and thirty Years ago? Why, Madam, &s;aid our Hero, you could not have been born at that early
<PB N="282" REF="283">Day. Ah you Flatterer, &s;ays &s;he, I am turned of Forty. But, pray Madam, who was he that was &s;o happy as to attract your infant Affections? &mdash; His Name was <HI>Harry Clinton</HI> &mdash; Why, Madam, <HI>Harry Clinton</HI> is my Name. &mdash; <HI>Harry Clinton, Harry Clinton!</HI> &s;creamed out the Lady, and &s;tarted up from her Chair; &mdash; Yes, Madam, I am Son to the Earl of <HI>Moreland,</HI> and I almo&s;t dare to hope that you were once the enchanting <HI>Fanny Goodall.</HI>&mdash;Yes, my lovely Kin&s;man, I am indeed your <HI>Fanny Goodall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then &s;prung forward, and &s;eizing her Hand, kept it dwelling on his Lips. But, di&s;engaging it, &s;he opened her Arms and cla&s;ped him to her Bo&s;om, and wept over him as a Mother would over a long-lo&s;t Son. While the young <HI>Moor</HI> ran and danced about the Room, like a mad Thing, clapping Hands, and &s;pringing, like an <HI>Antelope,</HI> almo&s;t to the Cieling.</P>
<P>When they were &s;omething compo&s;ed, the <HI>Moor</HI> caught the Lady about the Neck and ki&s;&s;ing her, cried, Joy, Joy, my dear|e&s;t Madam, the greate&s;t of all Joys! Then turning to our Hero, he took each of his Hands, in Turns, and pre&s;&s;ed them to his Lips, while <HI>Harry,</HI> ki&s;&s;ing his Forehead, cried, my Brother, my Brother!</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="284">
When they were again &s;et to Dinner, <HI>Jack</HI> entered. My Lord, &s;ays he, I have been all along the Quays and the Shipping, but can learn no Tidings of the Marquis <HI>D'Aubigny,</HI> nor of any <HI>French</HI> Family &s;ave that of the Dutche&s;s <HI>Bouillon,</HI> who, this Morning, came up the River with a nume|rous Train.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> our Happine&s;s has been already quite &s;ufficient to the Day. To morrow may crown our Wi&s;hes with full Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>No, my Love, &s;aid the Lady, you can|not &s;ee the Marquis for &s;ome Time. The Truth is that you find, in me, your <HI>Fanny Goodall,</HI> the Marchione&s;s <HI>D'Aubigny,</HI> and the Duche&s;s <HI>de Bouillon.</HI> But the&s;e Matters &s;hall be explaimed more clearly, when I am ble&s;&s;ed with the Sight of your precious Uncle.</P>
<P>News was now brought that the Car|riages were at the Door, when, taking a ha&s;ty Bit or two, they vi&s;ited and left Orders for the Care of the Sick and Wound|ed, and then &s;et out in a Hurry for <HI>Pal Mall.</HI></P>
<P>When they arrived, the Dutche&s;s ha&s;|tened in, enquiring for Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and,
<PB N="284" REF="285">when &s;he came where he was, &s;he cried out, as &s;he advanced, and as he ro&s;e to re|ceive her, your <HI>Fanny,</HI> your <HI>Fanny Goodall,</HI> my Cou&s;in! and throwing her&s;elf into his Arms, dwelt there for a Minute. Then recoiling awhile, &s;he looked fondly at him and cried, your Si&s;ter al&s;o, my Brother, your Si&s;ter <HI>D'Aubigny!</HI> the Wife of the Brother of your heavenly <HI>Loui&s;a!</HI> then cla&s;ping him to her Arms, &s;he broke into Tears; and again, quitting him, &s;at down to quiet her Emotions.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> having &s;eated him&s;elf affec|tionately be&s;ide her, &s;aid: The&s;e are won|drous Things that you tell me, my pre|cious Si&s;ter; by what Miracle have the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings been brought about?</P>
<P>I am too much agitated at pre&s;ent, &s;ays &s;he, let me have a little Coffee, and the Matter &s;hall be unravelled.</P>
<P>As they were &s;ettling to the Tea-table, give me Leave, Sir, &s;aid the Duche&s;s, to introduce my little black Companion to your Notice. He is a &s;weet Fellow I a&s;&s;ure you, notwith&s;tanding his Complexion. He is Child to our royal Friend the Emperor of <HI>Morocco,</HI> who has entru&s;ted him to our Guardian&s;hip for his Travel and Education. However he might have come by his &s;able Out&s;ide, his Father, the great <HI>Abenamin,</HI>
<PB N="285" REF="286">is the lea&s;t of the tawny of any Man I &s;aw in <HI>Africa,</HI> and his Mother is one of the faire&s;t and fine&s;t Women that ever opened a Pair of living Diamonds to the Light; but, &s;he took Fright, while &s;he was preg|nant, at the &s;udden Sight of a <HI>Blackamoor.</HI> But, my Brother, I &s;hall more particularly recommend him to your Regard, by tell|ing you that he is an exceedingly pious Chri&s;tian, though as playful as Lambs and as chuckling as Infancy.</P>
<P>She then turned and, taking the little <HI>Abenamin</HI> by the Hand, led him up and placed him before her Brother. When the Youth, &s;uddenly dropping on his Knees, looked up to Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> with Eyes that &s;poke Love and reverential Awe, and be&s;ought his Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman found him&s;elf &s;ur|prizingly affected and, lifting up his Hands, cried, God be gracious to you, my Child, and make your Soul as bright as your Countenance is &s;able! and may the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hine with Power upon you, and &s;oon di&s;per&s;e or illumine every Shade that is about You. The Prince embraced his Legs, ki&s;&s;ed his Knees, and aro&s;e.</P>
<P>Soon as the Coffee was removed, You may remember, my deare&s;t Cou&s;in, &s;aid
<PB N="286" REF="287">the Duche&s;s, in what a Hurry I la&s;t parted from you. Mr. <HI>Fairface,</HI> with whom the Bulk of my Fortune was depo&s;ited, went off with above a hundred thou&s;and Pounds of my Sub&s;tance, be&s;ide four times that Value entru&s;ted to him by Others.</P>
<P>I traced him to <HI>Paris,</HI> and there he had the Impudence to give me an Interview, but at the &s;ame Time had the Impudence to bid me Defiance.</P>
<P>Immediately I commenced Suit, and &s;ent di&s;patch to <HI>London</HI> for my Papers and Wit|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>On the Opening of my Cau&s;e in Court, I was &s;ummoned by the Title of Counte&s;s of <HI>Maitland,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Frances Goodall.</HI> On hearing the Name, a Gentleman who was near me &s;tarted, and turning and coming up, Pray, Madam, &s;ays he, are you any way related to the honourable <HI>Harry Clinton,</HI> who once went by that Name in this City? I am Sir, &s;aid I, almo&s;t the neare&s;t Rela|tion that he has upon Earth. &mdash; He is, Madam, my deare&s;t Friend and Brother. Pray &s;peak to your Advocates to po&s;tpone your Suit for a few Days, till I am inform|ed of the Nature and Merits of your Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="288">
This was accordingly done. He de&s;ired to know where I lodged, and in le&s;s than an Hour his Chariot was at my Door.</P>
<P>Except your&s;elf, my Cou&s;in, the Mar|quis had the mo&s;t lovely and winning A&s;|pect and Per&s;on that ever I beheld. I &s;oon convinced him of the Equity of my De|mand and of the Villainy of my Tru&s;tee, and made him perfect Ma&s;ter of the whole Affair. But he &s;till continued to vi&s;it, and to &s;tay with me a con&s;iderable Part of every Day, under Colour of being better inform|ed touching this and t'other Particular, the remaining Time was &s;pent in &s;oliciting for me.</P>
<P>At length a Hearing came on; and, after a &s;hort Trial hone&s;t <HI>Fairface</HI> was ca&s;t in Principal and double Co&s;ts. He was in&s;tantly taken into Cu&s;tody, and put un|der Confinement, till he di&s;charged the whole Amount of the Judgment in my Favour.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was one Suit over, wherein I was Plaintiff, but Another was commenced wherein I happened to prove but a very weak Defendant. The Marquis now be|came Solicitor for him&s;elf, but with &s;uch a &s;weet Timidity as &s;eemed to doubt, and greatly dread the Succe&s;s of his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289">
I could not refu&s;e my Time to him who had devoted the Whole of his Time and A&s;&s;iduity to me. We &s;pent whole Days together. But O, what Floods of Tears did that Time (at Times) co&s;t both him and me, while he pathetically and feelingly related your Hi&s;tory, from the Place where you broke off, to the Death of your <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> and your precious Infants.</P>
<P>I believe, my Cou&s;in, that, as Grief is a greater Softener, &s;o it is a greater Ce|menter of Hearts than any other Pa&s;&s;ion. I gave the Marquis, in my Turn, my lit|tle Story, and dwelt on every tender Mi|nutene&s;s of my infant Pa&s;&s;ion for you. Ah, &s;aid he, what a pity that a Heart, &s;o &s;u&s;|ceptible of all divine and humane Feel|ings, &s;hould &s;it as a lonely Turtle, upon the Hou&s;e-top, without a &s;uitable Mate.</P>
<P>I took him for that Mate, my Cou&s;in, and in a Hu&s;band I found the true&s;t and tendere&s;t of Lovers. I became pregnant, for the fir&s;t Time of my Life, and was de|livered of a &s;weet and promi&s;ing little Fel|low, whom we left at Nur&s;e in our Coun|try Seat, while I attended my Lord on his Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Morocco:</HI></P>
<P>But, here I mu&s;t &s;top, my Brother, I am under the po&s;itive Interdiction of an
<PB N="289" REF="290">imperial Thing called a Hu&s;band, not to divulge a Word further till he &s;ees you Face to Face. But I tru&s;t that he has ble&s;&s;ed Tidings for you, my Brother, he &s;ays that he, otherwi&s;e, would not have dared to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before you, after his Lo&s;s of your <HI>Eloi&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> &s;miled (carele&s;s) as at the Impo&s;&s;ibility of any con&s;oling Event upon Earth. Again, &s;miling archly, I prote&s;t, my Si&s;ter, &s;aid he, you appear to me to grow younger for your Years. I &s;ee no Manner of Alteration, &s;ave that you are &s;omething plumper, and not quite &s;o &s;len|der as when we parted. O, &s;ays &s;he, laughing, there may be a Rea&s;on in Na|ture for that.</P>
<P>I rejoice at Heart to hear it, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton;</HI> but pray, when may we expect my Brother? &mdash; In about two Months; at pre&s;ent he is engaged with the King, who is extremely fond of him, and lately created him a Duke, on account of the Services which he rendered the State in <HI>Africa.</HI> We received your dear Letter, my deare&s;t Brother, at <HI>Paris,</HI> but wonder|ed who the &s;weet Fellow could be who was &s;aid to accompany you.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, our Hero and the young Prince were in clo&s;e Combination.
<PB N="290" REF="291"><HI>Abenamin</HI> &s;tepped about, and about <HI>Harry,</HI> and toyed with him, and twi&s;ted the Curls of his carele&s;s Locks around his Fingers. Then turning and looking fondly up in his Face, Ah, how fair, &s;ays he, does this black Vi&s;age of mine &s;hew in tho&s;e fine Eyes of yours! It is in Truth, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;o fair in my Eyes, that I would not ex|change it for fifteen of the faire&s;t female Faces in <HI>Britain.</HI> The Prince then caught his Hand and pre&s;&s;ed it to his Bo&s;om. But what &s;hall I call you, &s;ays he, you are a great Lord in this Country, and, in my own Country I am greater than a Lord. But I hate the Formality of Titles between Friends, and I will call you my <HI>Harry,</HI> provided you promi&s;e to call me your <HI>Abe|namin.</HI> A Bargain, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> let us &s;eal it with a Ki&s;s! No, no, &s;ays the Prince, we never ki&s;s Lips in <HI>Africa,</HI> but I will ki&s;s your Head, and your Hands, and your Feet too with Plea&s;ure. But tell me, <HI>Harry,</HI> what makes you &s;o mighty clever a Fellow, will you teach me to be a clever Fellow al&s;o? Ay, that I will, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> and to beat my&s;elf too, provided you pro|mi&s;e not to hit me over hard. <HI>Abenamin</HI> fell a laughing, and aimed a little Fi&s;t as though he meant to overturn him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Harry</HI>'s Grief, for his late <HI>Maria,</HI> would allow him to a&s;&s;ociate, he
<PB N="291" REF="292">had been to &s;eek his old Friend and Tutor Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> but he found only a &s;ingle Dome&s;tic at home, who told him that the old Gentleman had been &s;ome Time dead, and that the Family were lately gone to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a new Seat that they had purcha&s;ed in the Country.</P>
<P>However, as <HI>Harry</HI> found him&s;elf quite happy in the pre&s;ent Society, he &s;ought no further Acquaintance or Amu&s;ement in <HI>London.</HI> In le&s;s than three Weeks, the Retinue of the Prince and the Dutche&s;s were well re&s;tored, and they All &s;et out for <HI>Enfield,</HI> there to await the wi&s;hed Ar|rival of the Duke.</P>
<P>They &s;lept the fir&s;t Night at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and toward the Noon of the third Day they &s;et up at the Angel Inn in <HI>Coventry.</HI></P>
<P>It happened to be a Sea&s;on of Fe&s;tivity in the Town. Over again&s;t the front Windows, a Stage had been erected for a Mountebank and his Merry Andrew; and, as &s;oon as they had di&s;mounted, it became a Stage for Combatants. Two Quarter&s;taffs and a Pair of Ba&s;ket-hilted Cudgels lay thereon; while an adjoining Pole was hung with a Variety of Prizes de|&s;tined to the Conquerors.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="293">
Immediatley two Champions mounted, with two Seconds appointed to &s;ee fair Play. But One of the Combatants was quickly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a broken Head. Another then &s;ucceeded, and then Another, to the Amount of half a Score, but the fir&s;t Hero &s;till kept the Field of Battle. While <HI>Harry</HI> &s;at, with his Company, looking out of the Dining-Room Windows at the Di|ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Jack</HI> came behind his Lord, and giving him a Touch on the Shoulder, whi&s;peringly begged his Permi&s;&s;ion to claim the Stage.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> a&s;&s;ented. <HI>Jack</HI> was up in a Twink|ling, and quickly di&s;patched the Victor, as he had &s;erved his Predece&s;&s;ors. A Number of Candidates then &s;ucceeded, but with no better Fortune; and the Prize was taking down to be deliver'd to our Friend <HI>Jack;</HI> when an elderly looking Man de&s;ired to be lifted on the Stage.</P>
<P>Come, &s;ays he to <HI>Jack,</HI> you &s;eem to be a clever Fellow, let us quit this Boy's Play, and take up the Quarter&s;taff; when <HI>Jack,</HI> remembering a Piece of an old Ballad, re|peated, <HI>accur&s;s'd be he, Earl</HI> Piercy <HI>&s;aid, by whom it is deny'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="294">
They gra&s;ped their formidable Wea|pons, and Each threw him&s;elf into an ex|pert Po&s;ture of Defence. Then began the Work to grow warm, and the&s;e Champi|ons had twice traver&s;ed the whole Round of the Stage, before a Wound or Brui&s;e was received on either Part.</P>
<P>At the third Bout, the old Stager made a Feint at his Adver&s;ary's left Leg, and, in attempting to defend it, the Sconce of our Friend <HI>Jack</HI> was cover'd with Blood, and he &s;prung off the Stage and in&s;tantly vani&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then &s;tepped backward and or|dered his Servant to be called, and, laugh|ing, cried, Ah my poor <HI>Jack!</HI> I knew what would be your Fate the Moment I &s;aw the Face of your Opponent. You unfortunatley met with the famous <HI>Oakum,</HI> the old Prizer of <HI>I&s;lington;</HI> many and many a Le&s;&s;on have I got from him. But, you may happen to get &s;ome Satisfaction ere long. Run, and give yonder Fool a Crown, for the Loan of his patched Coat for a few Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Jack</HI> flew on his Emba&s;&s;y, while <HI>Harry</HI> burned a Stick at a back Room Fire, with which he made to him&s;elf very formidable Eyebrows and Whi&s;kers. Then, hurry|ing
<PB N="294" REF="295">on the Fool's Coat, he &s;tepped forth and de&s;ired to be lifted on the Stage.</P>
<P><HI>Oakum</HI> little expected a &s;econd Adver&s;a|ry, but, when he &s;aw the Merry-Andrew, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, he had like to be &s;uffocated by a &s;udden Fit of Laughter, while the Crowd tore the Elements to Fritters with their Clamour.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then put him&s;elf in an aukward and pea&s;ant-like Po&s;ture, while <HI>Oakum,</HI> ad|vancing carele&s;ly, made a &s;light but, as he thought, demoli&s;hing Stroke at him. But <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;etting it a&s;ide with the one End of his Staff, gave <HI>Oakum,</HI> with the other End, as it were a chance Chuck under the Chin, and to&s;&s;ed him on the broad of his Back along the Stage.</P>
<P>The Shouts of the Populace were then redoubled. At length <HI>Oakum,</HI> ari&s;ing, fixed his Eyes upon <HI>Harry</HI> with an inqui&s;itive A&s;toni&s;hment, as de&s;irous of knowing how this Bu&s;ine&s;s came about. While <HI>Harry,</HI> with a Grin of &s;tupid Amazement, &s;eemed equally to wonder at what he had done.</P>
<P>Again they &s;et them&s;elves in ho&s;tile Op|po&s;ition. <HI>Oakum</HI> then aimed a di&s;abling Stroke at <HI>Harry's</HI> right Shin; but <HI>Harry,</HI> quick as Thought, &s;lipping his Leg back|ward,
<PB N="295" REF="296">gave the Weapon Room to pa&s;s, and, at the &s;ame Time, be&s;towing a &s;ud|den Tip on the Crown of his old Ma&s;ter, he cut him along the Skull, and gave him once more to mea&s;ure his Length upon the Boards.</P>
<P>The Crowd &s;tood awhile &s;ilent, as &s;carce crediting what had pa&s;&s;ed before their Eyes, till <HI>Oakum,</HI> ri&s;ing and &s;taggering, and again fa&s;tening his Sight upon our Hero, cried aloud, either You mu&s;t be the DEVIL or young HARRY FENTON.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then &s;tepped up, and put his Mouth to the Ear of his Adver&s;ary. <HI>Oakum,</HI> &s;ays he, here are five Guineas to help toward the Cure of your broken Head. But remember that it is not honourable for the Ma&s;ters of our Science to &s;et them|&s;elves in Competition again&s;t the Ignorant. <HI>Oakum</HI> bowed and withdrew; crying, Hea|ven be prai&s;ed that it is no Other than my own Scholar who foils me.</P>
<P>The Clamours of the Populace now be|came outrageous. The Prize of a &s;ilver'd Coronet interwoven with Laurel, was pluck|ed down in a hurry and placed on the Head of our Hero. All the Towns-people then put their Hands in their Pockets, and, mu&s;tering their Shillings and Sixpences, threw them in Showers on the Stage;
<PB N="296" REF="297">while the Dutche&s;s, Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and the generous <HI>Abenamin</HI> al&s;o emptied their Poc|kets, to reward the Prowe&s;s of the Man who had vindicated the Quarrel of their favourite <HI>Jack.</HI></P>
<P>All this Profu&s;ion of Money was faith|fully gathered up, by the two Seconds, and delivered in a Hat full of Silver to <HI>Harry,</HI> who, be&s;towing a Handful on Each, delivered the Remainder to his Man <HI>Jack</HI> who &s;tood by the Stage.</P>
<P>The Crowd then a&s;cended, and, laying violent Hands on our Hero, bore him tri|umphantly away. They then placed him in an Arm-Chair erected on long Poles, and, hoi&s;ing his Carriage on their Shoul|ders, they carried him in the Mid&s;t of Peals of Shouts up the Street, while an ap|pointed Herald went before them and cried, O the FOOL, the FOOL, the brave, the no|ble FOOL, who beats the Skill of the Wi&s;e, and the Acts of the Mighty to Pieces! At length, <HI>Harry,</HI> growing tired of this Pa|rade, put his Hand on the Head of one of his Carriers, vaulted lightly over, in&s;tantly vani&s;hed from their Sight, and flew up Stairs to his Company.</P>
<P>His Friends now began to recognize their <HI>Harry,</HI> in the Coat of the Fool, and
<PB N="297" REF="298">broke into repeated Fits of Laughter. <HI>Abenamin</HI> then turned to his beloved Friend and cried, what's become of my hand&s;ome <HI>Harry?</HI> why, he is turned to almo&s;t as ug|ly a Fellow as my&s;elf. Then, ki&s;&s;ing his Forehead and &s;troaking his Cheeks, he &s;aid, O, It was the clevere&s;t and darlinge&s;t FOOL that ever I knew in the livelong Days that I have pa&s;&s;ed upon Earth.</P>
<P>When the Populace perceived their fa|vourite Fool &s;eated in the Mid&s;t of Quality, they All gathered to the Inn, and com|menced their Shouts anew. But <HI>Harry,</HI> calling for his Hat of Silver, as al&s;o for all the Change that could be mu&s;tered in the Hou&s;e, amounting to the Value of about thirty Guineas, he threw his Ca&s;h in Hand|fulls on every Side, till he was nearly ex|hau&s;ted, and that the Crowd cried out, Enough, enough, your Honour, too much, too much indeed&punc; O, that All would equally learn to &s;et Bounds to their Avarice!</P>
<P>When Dinner was over, and that <HI>Harry</HI> was re&s;tored to his former Self, our Com|pany, again, &s;et out on their Journey, amid&s;t the Ble&s;&s;ings and Acclamations of the whole City, who had ranged them&s;elves on, each Side, to behold and pay them Obei|&s;ance as they pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299">
The next Day, as they &s;topped at a Village to repair the fractured Harne&s;s of an over mettled Hor&s;e; <HI>Harry,</HI> mean while, took a walk with his <HI>Abenamin</HI> along the Road. In their Way they came to a long and wa&s;te Cottage, where they heared the confu&s;ed clattering of junior Voices. <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tepped to the Door, and, looking in, perceived about forty or fifty Boys rang|ed on Benches of Turf, while a Man of a pale A&s;pect &s;at on a decayed Chair, in&s;truct|ing them in their Le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>Your Servant, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> pray what Language do you teach? &mdash; I can teach <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> too, &s;o plea&s;e your Ho|nour, but the People of this Country choo&s;e to confine them&s;elves to the Language of old <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;If I am not too free, Sir, pray what is your Name?&mdash;<HI>Longfield,</HI> &s;o plea&s;e your Honour.&mdash;<HI>Longfield, Longfield?</HI> I have &s;urely heared that Name before. Pray, were you ever acquainted with a Man called <HI>Hammel Clement? &mdash; Hammel Clement,</HI> Sir? he was my deare&s;t Friend, the Friend whom I injured, the Friend of my Heart! &mdash; Then, cries <HI>Harry,</HI> you are the Friend of my Heart too, my <HI>Longfield,</HI> and &s;o &s;aying, he em|braced and pre&s;&s;ed him to his Bo&s;om.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="299-348" TYPE="pages">
<PB N="299" REF="300">
<P>The poor Man &s;hrunk back, in half Wonder and half Terror at what this might mean, but the benevolent <HI>Harry</HI> &s;oon quieted his Apprehen&s;ions. Your Friend <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays-he, is come to great Fortune, and, I dare an&s;wer for him, would be nearly di&s;tracted with Joy at your Sight, and would gladly divide his Sub&s;tance with you; but, if you plea&s;e, you &s;hall be no Incumbrance upon his growing Family. You &s;hall in&s;tantly come with me, and, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Jacob,</HI> regard not your Stuff, for the Good of all my Lands lies before You, my <HI>Longfield.</HI> And I rejoice more in acquiring &s;uch a Heart as Yours, than if I had acquired the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Province.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then called a few of the Neigh|bours in, and giving them &s;ome Guineas, to be changed and divided among the Chil|dren, in order to enable them to &s;ee a new Ma&s;ter, He and <HI>Abenamin</HI> took the thread|bare <HI>Longfield,</HI> on each Side, under the Arm, and carried him away.</P>
<P>When they came to the Turn that led to the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, <HI>Harry</HI> perceived with much Plea&s;ure, that the two School-Hou&s;es, which he had put in Hand before the Death of his Father, were now com|pleated. They &s;tood oppo&s;ite to each
<PB N="300" REF="301">other, with the Road between them. Their Fronts were of hewn Stone; and a &s;mall Cupola ro&s;e over Each, with Bells to &s;ummon the Children to Meals and to Le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Longfield,</HI> &s;ays our Hero, is to be your Province. You are to &s;uperintend the&s;e Schools, at a Salary of three hundred a Year. And I will &s;oon &s;end you, with proper Means, throughout the Country, to mu&s;ter me a Hundred cho&s;en Children of each Sex, for I yearn to be a Father, <HI>Longfield,</HI> and to gather my Family of Lit|tle Ones under my Eye and my Wing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they alighted, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> and his <HI>Harry</HI> once more welcomed the Dutche&s;s and her <HI>Abenamin</HI> to their Home and their Hearts, and the late Hou&s;e of Mourning became a Hou&s;e of Joy.</P>
<P>Above All, <HI>Abenamin</HI> in&s;pired Mirth and Good humour throughout the Family; and Melancholy fled before him wherever he turned. He was daily inventive of new Matters of Entertainment. He danced <HI>African</HI> Dances, for them, with wonderful Action and Grace; and he &s;ung <HI>African</HI> Songs that imitated and exceeded the wild and inarticulate Warblings of the Nightin|gale. So that he became the Darling and little Idol of the whole Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="302">
<HI>Harry</HI> had &s;ent for the Town Taylor, and got <HI>Longfield</HI> fitted with three or four Suits from his Father's Wardrobe. He then &s;ent him on his Commi&s;&s;ion, in Com|pany with Mr. <HI>Tru&s;tly</HI> the Agent, whom he ordered to &s;hew him the Country, to intro|duce him to the &s;everal Families of the Pea&s;antry, and to furni&s;h him with what|ever Sums he &s;hould call for.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, our Hero and <HI>Abe|namin</HI> became in&s;eparable. He made the Prince a Pre&s;ent of his little dre&s;&s;ed Jennet, and at Times rode out with him, and taught him the Manage. At other Times they would run and wre&s;tle, and play a hundred Gambols through the Walks and the Gardens.</P>
<P>Did you ever &s;ee the Cha&s;e of the Ante|lope, <HI>Harry?</HI>&mdash;Not I truely.&mdash;You &s;han't be long &s;o, &s;ays the Prince. Go, gather me all the Hou&s;e, Man, Woman, and Child before the Door here. You &s;hall be the Hunt&s;man, and I will be the Antelope, and if any of your People can catch me, in a Mile's Running, they &s;hall have my Cap for a Kerchief.</P>
<P>Immediately the whole Po&s;&s;e was &s;um|moned, to the amount of about &s;ixty Per|&s;ons,
<PB N="302" REF="303">Male and Female; and Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> and the Dutche&s;s, hearing what they were about, came laughing to the Door to &s;ee the Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then gave his royal Antelope about fifty Yards Law, then cried, away! and in&s;tantly all Heels and all Voices were loo&s;ed after him.</P>
<P>The Prince then turned, and bounded over an Aha, that was &s;unk on the right Side of the Avenue, then, clearing &s;everal other Ob&s;tacles, whereby he threw out the greate&s;t Number of his Pur&s;uers, he at length reached the Fields, and &s;hot away like an Arrow.</P>
<P>Our Friend <HI>Jack</HI> headed about nine fo|reign and dome&s;tic Footmen, who &s;till held the Cha&s;e, though at a Di&s;tance; while <HI>Abenamin</HI> led them a Round of above a Mile. Then, turning &s;hort homeward, he came flying up the Avenue, with only <HI>Jack</HI> and two Followers puffing far behind. At length, reaching near the Door, the Prince threw him&s;elf precipitately into the Arms of his Friend, as it were for Protec|tion, crying, Save me, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ave, &s;ave your little Antelope!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> and the Dutche&s;s, then, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively embraced the Victor, and wi&s;h|ed
<PB N="303" REF="304">him Joy. I prote&s;t, <HI>Harry,</HI> cried Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> I will bet a thou&s;and Pieces with you, on the Head of my <HI>Abenamin</HI> again&s;t your famous <HI>Polly Truck.</HI></P>
<P>That Night, as our Hero &s;at with the Prince in his Apartment, Have You ever been in Love, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he? I con|fe&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> that I have had my Twitches and Tendencies that Way.</P>
<P>He then gave him a Narrative of the Struggles of his Heart, re&s;pecting the fair <HI>Aggy Je&s;&s;amin.</HI> And again he related to him the Tragedy of his faithful <HI>Maria,</HI> which co&s;t the Prince the drenching of a Handkerchief in Tears.</P>
<P>Ah, exclaimed the Prince, never, never will I forgive your <HI>Maria</HI> her Death! Why was it not my Lot, by &s;ome &s;everer Doom, to prove to you the Superiority of my Friend&s;hip and Affection? What, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> would you not leave me a &s;ingle Companion upon Earth? when my <HI>Abena|min</HI> quits the World, I &s;hall al&s;o bid it adieu!</P>
<P>When Tears were wiped away, the Prince took his Friend by the Hand and &s;aid: I have a Si&s;ter, my Brother, a Si&s;ter twinned with me in the Womb, and as fair
<PB N="304" REF="305">as I am black. All <HI>Africa</HI> is plea&s;ed to hail her as the Beauty of the Univer&s;e, but the Truth is, that I think but poorly of her. The Duke brought her with him to <HI>France,</HI> and, &s;hould he bring her to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> beware of your Heart, my <HI>Harry!</HI> for, though I am prejudiced again&s;t her, &s;he is the Idol of all Others, who bow down to her, as before a little Divinity. This has made her &s;o exce&s;&s;ively vain, that &s;he holds her&s;elf of a different Species from the re&s;t of Mankind, and thinks the Ho|mage of the World nothing le&s;s than her Right. And now, my <HI>Harry,</HI> though I earne&s;tly wi&s;h to be allied to you, by a Tie, nearer if po&s;&s;ible than that of Friend|&s;hip, yet I would not wi&s;h my own Happi|ne&s;s, at the Expence of your Peace; and &s;o I give you timely Warning again&s;t this dangerous and haughty Girl.</P>
<P>Our Company had now been upward of &s;ix Weeks at the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e. <HI>Harry,</HI> hitherto, had never &s;een any Part of the Country, or any Part of his own E&s;tate, above a Mile from the Hou&s;e. Where|fore, leaving his Friend <HI>Abenamin</HI> in Bed, in the Pre&s;umption of his being tired with his la&s;t Day's Fatigue, He i&s;&s;ued early forth, accompanied only by <HI>Jack</HI> and his Agent's Runner, who knew and was known every where.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306">
With their Staffs in their Hands, they cro&s;&s;ed and quartered the Country, at Plea&s;ure, without Let or Ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>At length, they came within Pro&s;pect of a Hou&s;e &s;umptuou&s;ly fronted, and of a happy Situation. <HI>Harry</HI> &s;topped here, with Plea&s;ure, comparing, as he approach|ed, the Acquirements of Art with the Advantages of Nature; when a Servant i&s;&s;ued forth, and humbly be&s;ought him to walk in. <HI>Harry</HI> heard the Voice of Mu&s;ic. What is your Ma&s;ter's Name, &s;ays he? <HI>Fielding,</HI> &s;o plea&s;e your Honour, and we are this Day celebrating the Nuptials of his Son, the young Squire.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of the Family met our Hero at the outward Door. <HI>Harry</HI> recoiled at recognizing the Face of the Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> whom he had &s;een at <HI>Ham&s;tead,</HI> but, taking no Notice, walked with him into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t, &s;oon after, was u&s;hered in, and Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> and Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Ca|tharines,</HI> and <HI>Ned</HI> came with his bloom|ing and blu&s;hing Bride to the Table.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> chuckled and rejoiced at Heart, but &s;till took no Note; when, after &s;ome
<PB N="306" REF="307">cur&s;ory Conver&s;ation, <HI>Ned</HI> looked at him with an eager Di&s;turbance and cried, Ble&s;s me, my Heart tells me that there is &s;ome|thing in that Face which is not quite un|known to me. If I could think, after my many and late Enquiries, that my Patron was alive, bating the Difference of Years, I &s;hould verily believe that you were&mdash;your <HI>Harry Fenton,</HI> cried our Hero, &s;pring|ing up, your <HI>Harry Fenton,</HI> my dear <HI>Ned!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then opened his Arms to receive his Friend, while <HI>Ned</HI> leaped and catched at him, as the grapling Iron of a Cor&s;air would catch at a Ship from which great Prize was expected,</P>
<P>All the Family then, &s;o highly as they had been obliged by our Hero and his Fa|ther, &s;truggled who &s;hould be foremo&s;t in their Acknowledgments and Care&s;&s;es. The holy <HI>Catharines,</HI> fondly taking him to his Arms cried, Chri&s;t be gracious to you, my Child! and may the God, who has formed you as an Angel upon Earth, make you al&s;o of the highe&s;t Order of Angels in Heaven!</P>
<P>After Dinner, <HI>Harry</HI> ro&s;e and took his Leave, but they all got in a Group and op|po&s;ed his Pa&s;&s;age, telling him he mu&s;t be their Pri&s;oner for that Night. I con|&s;ent, only on this Condition, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI>
<PB N="307" REF="308">that you promi&s;e to dine with me, All, To-morrow. Why pray Sir, where do you live, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fielding?</HI> At <HI>Enfield,</HI> with the young Earl of <HI>Moreland,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> but he has a great Friend&s;hip for me, and the Hou&s;e is as it were my own.</P>
<P>Much Company arrived in the Evening, and the Ball was opened and held till late. But our Hero declined dancing, that his Friend <HI>Ned</HI> might &s;tand forth peerle&s;s in the Eyes of his Bride.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> ro&s;e, by the Dawning, and footed it in an Hour to <HI>Enfield.</HI> He flew up Stairs to &s;alute the Family, but found no One, &s;ave Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> from whom he re|ceived, at once, a warm Ble&s;&s;ing and Em|brace.</P>
<P>Where is the Dutche&s;s, Sir, and my Friend <HI>Abenamin?</HI> Gone, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays his Uncle, about Breakfa&s;t Time Ye&s;terday; a Courier arrived with the joyful Tidings that my Brother was on the Road, and &s;o my Si&s;ter and our <HI>Abenamin</HI> ha&s;tened to meet him. By this Time I &s;uppo&s;e they are All on their Return. And now take Care of your&s;elf, my <HI>Harry.</HI> The Duke brings with him the Si&s;ter of our <HI>Abenamin,</HI> the fair Prince&s;s <HI>Abenaid&egrave;;</HI> the Dutche&s;s tells me that a lovelier Creature never be|held
<PB N="308" REF="309">the Light; &s;o that you mu&s;t guard your Heart with double Bars, again&s;t the Power of this Beauty.&mdash;She is vain and di&s;dainful, Sir, exce&s;&s;ively vain, I am told, &s;o that her Pride will prove an Antidote again&s;t the Poi&s;on of her Charms. How|ever I will ha&s;te to meet and welcome your mo&s;t noble Brother.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> was mounted on a haughty Char|ger, that co&s;t fifteen hundred Guineas when a Colt in <HI>Mauritania.</HI> He was white as new fallen Snow, &s;ave a black Mane and Tail, one Foot jet Black to the Joint of the Fetlock, and three large blood-like Spots on the far Shoulder. He was &s;o perfectly in|&s;tructed and &s;ubdued to the Manage, that he &s;eemed to have no Will &s;ave the Will of his Rider, while <HI>Harry</HI>'s lea&s;t Motion, like Electricity, informed every Joint and Member. O, that the Wills of all Men were equally &s;ubdued to the Sceptre of the Prince of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, reigning and ruling within them!</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s came foremo&s;t in an open Chariot drawn by &s;ix &s;potted Arabians. The Chariot was plated all around in bur|ni&s;hed Gold emblazoned with Gems of Lu&s;tre. But, if the Eye could &s;carce bear the Blaze of the Vehicle, much le&s;s could it &s;upport the Brightne&s;s of the Beauty who &s;at enthroned within it.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="310">
<HI>Harry</HI> bowed twice, as he approached, but &s;he &s;care deigned a perceptible Nod of Acknowledgment to his Salute.&mdash;Our Hero felt him&s;elf piqued. Proud Beauty! thought he, I thank you for your timely Prevention of a Pa&s;&s;ion that, perhaps, might have proved unhappy to me. He then pa&s;&s;ed forward with affected Carele&s;|ne&s;s to &s;alute the Duke.</P>
<P>When he came up, the Coach &s;topped, and <HI>Harry,</HI> flying from his Saddle, ap|proached the Window, while his Steed &s;tood trembling but motionle&s;s behind him.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;eizing the Duke's Hand and re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ing it, if you were &s;en&s;ible of the Joy that my Heart receives from your Pre&s;ence, I think it would make you nearly as happy as my|&s;elf. My &s;weet Fellow, &s;aid the Duke, I have often heard of you at <HI>Paris,</HI> as al&s;o by the Letters of my Love here; my Longing at la&s;t is gratified, though my Wonder is encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But Madam, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> what have you done with my little Playfellow, what's become of my <HI>Abenamin?</HI> O, cried the Dutche&s;s, laughing, he is forthcoming I
<PB N="310" REF="311">warrant you; but what has &s;o bewitched you to him? I think you could not be fon|der, if he were a Mi&s;tre&s;s. True, Madam, an&s;wered <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ighing, I never look to have a Mi&s;tre&s;s that I &s;hall love half as well; but pray put me out of Pain, and let me know where he is. Be pacified, &s;aid the &s;miling Duke, he is not far off; and here is my Hand and Promi&s;e that you &s;hall &s;ee him before Night.</P>
<P>Our Hero then turned, and touching his left Hand to the Shoulder of his Hor&s;e, he ro&s;e perpendicular, like a Pyramid of Fire, and again de&s;cended on his Seat, as a Flake of Snow on a Ro&s;e-Bud. He then touched his white Wand to the Neck of his Steed, who in&s;tantly mounted the Air, like a winged <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> while the Dutche&s;s &s;hout|ed out, thinking her <HI>Harry</HI> a gone Man, but he returned as compo&s;ed, as though he were &s;eated on a Bed of Cotton.</P>
<P>The Coach now began to move, and <HI>Harry</HI> put his Wand to the Flank of his Hor&s;e, who, turning his Head to the Car|riage, as of his own Accord, moved &s;ide|long toward <HI>Enfield,</HI> with a proud but gen|tle Prancing; while the Duke cried out, Look, look! O the Boy, O the Boy, the lovely glorious Boy!</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="312">
As our Hero attended the Carriage of the Duke, the Prince&s;s and her Train had got to the Hou&s;e and alighted, while <HI>Harry</HI> opened the Coach Door, and handed out the noble Pair, who alternately ki&s;&s;ed and took him to their Arms. Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> then came forth and received them All with Tran&s;port. But <HI>Harry,</HI> under &s;ome Pre|tence, walked away, ruminating, in order to avoid the di&s;dainful Regards of the young Lady.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, our Company, re|joicing, and care&s;&s;ing Each other all the Way, had got &s;lowly, though very loving|ly, to the great Man&s;ion Parlour. The Duke then, re&s;pectfully taking the young Lady by the Hand, Permit me, Brother, &s;ays he, to recommend to you my lovely Ward, the fair Prince&s;s of <HI>Morocco.</HI> The Lady then gently bent one Knee toward the Ground, while &s;he received the cordial Ble&s;&s;ing and Salute of the old Gentleman.</P>
<P>They then took their Seats. When, Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> while he looked more earne&s;t|ly on the Prince&s;s, grew &s;uddenly affected, and called out for a Gla&s;s of fair Water and Hart&s;horn. When he drank it, be found him&s;elf in a Mea&s;ure re&s;tored, and, lifting his Hands, he cried, I prote&s;t One would think that Nature had copied this
<PB N="312" REF="313">young and lovely Creature from an Image that has lain impre&s;&s;ed upon my Heart, near the&s;e forty Years.</P>
<P>You are in the right, my Brother, ex|claimed the Duke, it is even as you &s;urmize. Allow me then, once more, to introduce to you the Counterpart of our once adora|ble <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> to introduce to you my Niece and your own Offspring, my Brother, even the Daughter of your &s;till living and ever precious <HI>Eloi&s;a.</HI> The Prince&s;s then &s;prung forward, and, dropping precipitately at the Feet of her Grandfather, &s;he put her Face between his Knees, and, &s;eizing both Hands, &s;he bathed them with her Tears, crying, My Father, O my Father, my dear, my deare&s;t Father, how inexpre&s;&s;i|bly ble&s;&s;ed I think my&s;elf, to be the Off|&s;pring of &s;uch a Father! Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> then rai&s;ing her, and &s;eating her fondly on his Knee, and gra&s;ping her to his Bo&s;om, I will not a&s;k, he cried, how the&s;e Miracles came about, it is enough that I feel the Attraction which pulls you into my Heart. And &s;o &s;aying, their Tears flowed, till they mingled on the Flooring.</P>
<P>Go, my Angel, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> and take yonder Seat, that I may view and delight my Soul with your Sight, at Lei|&s;ure. My Eyes begin, at the&s;e Years, to &s;ee be&s;t at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="314">
At length, the &s;oft Voice of our <HI>Harry</HI> was heard in the Hall, and the Duke, whi&s;pering his Brother, reque&s;ted him, for a little Time, to take no Notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Our Hero then entered, bowing re&s;pect|fully and gracefully, but carele&s;ly toward the Side where the Prince&s;s &s;at. He then took his Seat be&s;ide the Duke, and bend|ing fondly to him, and &s;eizing a Hand, with both his Hands, he pre&s;&s;ed it to his Lips and cried, Welcome, welcome, my deare&s;t Lord, to the Hou&s;e and the Hearts of your true&s;t Lovers!</P>
<P>Then, giving a Glance to the Side where the Prince&s;s &s;at, he caught a Glimp&s;e of her Attractions and, &s;ighing, &s;aid to him|&s;elf, O, the Pity, the Pity! But, no Mat|ter; her Pride &s;hall never &s;uffer a &s;ingle Charm to take Place; and, &s;o thinking, he turned his Eyes a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Mean time, <HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> aro&s;e, with as lit|tle Noi&s;e as a Hare from her Seat; and &s;tealing round, like a Cat circumventing a Mou&s;e, She came behind <HI>Harry</HI>'s Chair, and reaching, and covering an Eye, with each of her Hands, &s;he turned his Head to her, and made a Sound with her Lips,
<PB N="314" REF="315">as though &s;he had ki&s;&s;ed him. <HI>Harry</HI> opened his Eyes in utter A&s;toni&s;hment, while in a Twinkling &s;tanding before him, &s;he chuckled a Laugh and cried, Ha, ha, he, &mdash; my <HI>Harry,</HI> what, have you for|got me, don't you remember your old Playfellow, your little Friend <HI>Abenamin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI>'s Eyes were now opened, in the Mid&s;t of the Hurry and Agitation of his Soul. At a Glimp&s;e he took in the whole Oppre&s;&s;ion of her Beauties; and, ca&s;ting him&s;elf, quick as a Glance of Lightning, at her Feet, he &s;eized the Hem of her Robe|ing and glued it to his Mouth.</P>
<P>At length, lifting up his Eyes, he cried, Ah, what are all the&s;e Wonders to me, or my Happine&s;s, unle&s;s my <HI>Abenamin</HI> will al&s;o become my <HI>Abenaid&egrave;?</HI> That, replied the Prince&s;s, is not at my Option, there &s;its my Lord and Father at who&s;e Di&s;po&s;al I am.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then ro&s;e, and, throwing him&s;elf at the Feet of his revered Patron, embraced his Legs in Silence, while Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> cried out, Yes, my <HI>Harry,</HI> I under&s;tand you; nothing &s;hall ever be wanting to the Hap|pine&s;s of my Darling, that the Power of his tender Parent and loving Uncle can effect. I can have nothing in Heaven or Earth,
<PB N="315" REF="316">that is not the Property of my <HI>Harry. Harry</HI> ki&s;&s;ed his Feet and &s;prung up.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> then continued, I aver, I am &s;till in a Labyrinth. Did you not &s;ay, my <HI>Abenaid&egrave;,</HI> that you were al&s;o our <HI>Abena|min?</HI> I did, my Lord, &s;ays &s;he, but I did not dare to avow my&s;elf. Ah what a pain|ful Struggle did that Re&s;triction co&s;t me! while I panted to catch and to cling to your honoured Feet; while I u&s;ed to look, and gaze upon you, unperceived; while my Heart &s;welled with Affection, and my Eyes with re&s;trained Tears, and while I ki&s;&s;ed, in &s;ecret, the Book that you read, and the Ground that you trod on.</P>
<P><HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> then &s;at down, and <HI>Harry,</HI> lightly throwing him&s;elf on the Ground be&s;ide her, looked be&s;eechingly around and cried, My Lord, my deare&s;t Lady, our &s;till precious <HI>Fanny Goodall,</HI> can you vouch, can ye warrant that I am &s;afe in this Mat|ter? Then, looking up to the Prince&s;s, and drinking her in; No, he cried, you can|not engage it, I feel that I &s;hall peri&s;h in the very Ec&s;ta&s;y of the Expectation of being united to her.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> came in. He had been long and far away, upon many a ble&s;&s;ed Tour of doing good through the
<PB N="316" REF="317">Earth. But, as &s;oon as he heared of the Arrival of his beloved Patron and young Lord, he rode po&s;t to embrace them.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> &s;prung from Love to Friend&s;hip, and catching him in his Arms, cried, O, my <HI>Meekly,</HI> my deare&s;t <HI>Meekly,</HI> how &s;ea&s;on|ably you come, to temper, by your Ad|vice, the in&s;ufferable Tran&s;ports of my Soul; behold the Regent of my Heart, be|hold the Queen of all my Wi&s;hes!</P>
<P><HI>Meekly</HI> then fixed his Eyes upon the Prince&s;s, and &s;oon after exclaimed; Graci|ous Father! what do I &s;ee? Can <HI>the Loui&s;a</HI> be re&s;u&s;citated and new rai&s;ed from the Dead? O then, it mu&s;t be &s;o, &s;he mu&s;t be her De&s;cendent. No One, &s;ave my peerle&s;s Patrone&s;s, could produce the Likene&s;s of my Patrone&s;s. But how this ble&s;&s;ing Mi|racle was brought about is the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>That is my Que&s;tion too, my dear <HI>Meek|ly,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> if my mo&s;t noble Bro|ther would be &s;o good as to &s;olve it. I will gratify you, Gentlemen, &s;aid the Duke, in as few Words as po&s;&s;ible. Mean while, the Prince&s;s withdrew.</P>
<P>On my Emba&s;&s;y to the Court of <HI>Morocco,</HI> I had &s;everal private Interviews with the Emperor, before my Credentials were open|ed in Public. I had the good Fortune to
<PB N="317" REF="318">be liked by him, &s;o that he &s;uffer'd no Day to pa&s;s without &s;eeing me. His Name was <HI>Abenamin,</HI> he was accounted a great Captain, he exceeded All in his Dominions for Grace of Per&s;on and Beauty of A&s;pect; and that which render'd him &s;till more &s;in|gular was, that he had given Liberty to all the Ladies of his Seraglio, and, for ma|ny Years, had kept con&s;tant to the reign|ing Sultana, &s;aid to be the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Beauty upon Earth.</P>
<P>As we grew more intimate, in the Exu|berance of his Affection for his Empre&s;s, he could not refrain from &s;peaking of her to me, and he promi&s;ed that, before I de|parted, I &s;hould &s;ee and conver&s;e with her; a Grace, he &s;aid, never granted to any other Man.</P>
<P>At length, the Day being appointed for my public Entry, I rode through the City, attended by a &s;umptuous Train, and alight|ing before the Palace, advanced to the Hall of Audience.</P>
<P>The Emperor was &s;eated, with his Sul|tana at his right Hand, upon a Throne of Ivory. As &s;oon as I had approached the Pre&s;ence, and began to open my Commi&s;|&s;ion, the Empre&s;s gave a great Shriek, and fell over in a Swoon upon the Bo&s;om of her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319">
The royal <HI>Abenamin</HI> in&s;tantly turned pale as Death, tore off her Veil with trem|bling Hands to give her Air, and called me to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as it is accounted Profa|nation for any Moor to touch the Per&s;on of the Empre&s;s. But, O Heaven, O my Friend! think what was my A&s;toni&s;hment when, in the pale Face of the Queen, I beheld the loved Features of our darling <HI>Eloi&s;a!</HI></P>
<P>The Court broke up in Confu&s;ion, and her Women came hurrying with Drops and E&s;&s;ences. As &s;oon as &s;he recover'd, &s;he opened her Eyes upon me, and reach|ing out her Arms, and catching me to her, &s;he cried. O my Uncle, my deare&s;t Uncle, am I &s;o ble&s;s'd then as to behold you before I expire.</P>
<P>The Monarch, in the mean Time, looked upon me with a jealous Eye, and twice put his Hand to the Haft of his Dag|ger, but checked his ri&s;ing Indignation, till he &s;hould have the My&s;tery of his Queen's Behaviour explained. The Women then rai&s;ed her up and bore her to her Apart|ment; while the Emperor, turning to me, with no very friendly A&s;pect, ordered me to follow him.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="320">
When I had attended a con&s;iderable Time in the Antichamber, He came forth with a &s;erene and joyous Countenance, and em|bracing me, cried, O my Friend, my dear Kin&s;man, how tran&s;ported I am to find and acknowledge You for &s;uch; the Parent of my Angel becomes a Part of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He then led me by the Hand into the Bedchamber of my <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> where we re|newed our Care&s;&s;es without Re&s;traint. But the Monarch, fearing that the&s;e Emotions would be too much for her, told me that he had &s;omething for my private Ear till Dinner; and took me into an adjoining Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>There, &s;eating, and taking me affecti|onately by the Hand, I will now tell you, my Uncle, &s;ays he, how I came by this ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure of your Niece.</P>
<P>I had fitted out a royal Ship of my own, not as a Cor&s;air, but rather for Trade in the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> On their Return from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as they pa&s;t, after a violent Hurricane, within Sight of old <HI>Car|thage,</HI> my People perceived, at a Di&s;tance, a Sloop &s;tranded on a Shoal of Sand about a League from the Shore. Immediately they &s;ent out a Boat and took the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="320" REF="321">Company in, con&s;i&s;ting of my Charmer, two female Companions, and three Servants in Livery, be&s;ide the Boatmen.</P>
<P>The Intendants of my Ship behaved them&s;elves with all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect toward the young Lady and her Attendants, and endeavoured to quiet her Terrors, by a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he was free, and that their Prince was a Per&s;on of too much Ho|nour and Humanity to derive any Advan|tage from the Di&s;a&s;ters of the Unfortu|nate.</P>
<P>The Moment that they brought her be|fore me, pale, trembling and in Tears; while &s;he dropt on her Knees, and lifted to me her fine Eyes in a petitioning Man|ner; the Gates of my Soul opened to the &s;weetly affecting Image, and ever after clo&s;ed, of their own accord, upon it.</P>
<P>Ah, I cried, heavenly Creature, calm, calm your cau&s;ele&s;s Fears! I &s;wear by our Prophet and the God of our Prophet, that I would rather &s;uffer the Gaunch, than put the &s;malle&s;t Con&s;traint on your Per&s;on or Inclinations. You are free, Madam, you &s;hall ever be free, &s;ave &s;o far as I may bind you by my tender Offices and Affections.</P>
<P>I rai&s;ed her, and &s;he grew &s;omething better a&s;&s;ured; when, bending a Knee in
<PB N="321" REF="322">my Turn, I ki&s;&s;ed her Robe and cried, Look not upon me as your Tyrant, look not on me as your Lover; but look upon me as your Friend, the tendere&s;t and true&s;t of Friends, who &s;hall ever be ready to &s;acrifice his own Happine&s;s to Your's.</P>
<P>From that Time I &s;tudied every Amu&s;e|ment, every Diver&s;ion, that might &s;erve to di&s;&s;ipate the timid Shrinkings of her re|maining Apprehen&s;ions. While I con|ducted my&s;elf toward her, with a di&s;tant though fond Re&s;pect, not even pre&s;uming to touch her ivory Hand.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, my Soul &s;icken'd, and grew cold to all other Women. If you were ever in Love, my dear <HI>D'Aubigny,</HI> you know that it is a cha&s;te as well as a tender Pa&s;&s;ion. I langui&s;hed indeed for her, I longed and langui&s;h'd to Death; but then it was rather for her Heart than her Per&s;on that I langui&s;hed.</P>
<P>One Day, as &s;he heaved a heavy but half &s;uppre&s;s'd Sigh, Ah my Angel, I cri|ed, I can have no Joy but Your's, and yet You have Griefs to which you keep your Friend, your <HI>Abenamin</HI> a Stranger. True, my Lord, &s;ays &s;he, Tears breaking from her, all your Bounties have not been able to &s;ilence the Calls of Kindred or Claims of Nature within me. Ah, my Parents, my
<PB N="322" REF="323">dear Parents; I feel more for You, than I feel even for my&s;elf, in being torn from you.</P>
<P>The Weight of her Affliction fell, like a Mountain, on my Soul and cru&s;hed me to her Feet. You would leave me then, <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> you wi&s;h to leave me, but your Ge|nero&s;ity delays to tell me &s;o, for fear of breaking my Heart.&mdash;Well, be it &s;o&mdash;go from me&mdash;you know I cannot &s;urvive you&mdash;but, my Death is of no Con&s;equence, my <HI>Eloi&s;a</HI> &s;hall be happy.&mdash;I will go this In&s;tant, I will di&s;patch my &s;wifte&s;t Galley to <HI>Languedoc</HI>&mdash;I will write Word to your Parents that you are &s;afe, that you are beloved, and yet pure and un|touched, &s;ince re&s;pected as a Deity.&mdash;I will invite them to come and take Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of my Trea&s;ures, my Dominions, my Heart: But&mdash;&s;hould they reject my Suit, I again &s;wear, by <HI>Alla,</HI> to &s;end You to them, laden with Wealth, though I my|&s;elf &s;hould drop dead at the In&s;tant of your Departure.</P>
<P>The noble Soul of my <HI>Eloi&s;a</HI> became in|&s;tantly affected. She caught a Hand be|tween both of hers, and bathing it with Tears, cried, O, now indeed you have bound me by Chains infinitely &s;tronger than all the Shackles that fa&s;ten the Slaves to the Gallies of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="324">
I kept firm to my Engagement, and, in a few Weeks, my winged Me&s;&s;engers re|turned. But, O the Tidings, the very doleful Tidings for my Beloved! They brought Word that they found no Crea|ture; &s;ave two ancient Dome&s;tics in the great Hotel, as two Ravens in the Mid&s;t of a lonely Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>From the&s;e they learned, that my <HI>Eloi&s;a</HI>'s Mother and little Brother were dead, that her Grandmother was dead, her Aunt the Marchione&s;s al&s;o dead, and that the Mar|quis had retired they knew not whither.</P>
<P>She wept ince&s;&s;antly, and I wept with her.&mdash;At length &s;he &s;oftly &s;aid; You have conquer'd, my Lord, you have con|quer'd; I am &s;ubdued by your Weight of Affection! O, that You could but conform to one Article more, that we might be united as one Heart, and one Soul, and one Sentiment for ever!</P>
<P>It was now, for the fir&s;t Time, that I dared to &s;eize her Hand, I cru&s;hed it to my Lips, and thru&s;t it into my Soul. What would you enjoin, I cried, I would do any Thing, dare any Thing to be united to my <HI>Eloi&s;a!</HI> in Life and in Death, Body to Body and Du&s;t to Du&s;t, never never to be &s;un|dered,
<PB N="324" REF="325">till her Spirit &s;hould make the Hea|ven of my Spirit hereafter.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;he &s;uddenly exclaimed, that, that is the very Thing I &s;o eagerly de&s;ire. Let the God of my Heart be the God of your Heart, let the God of my Spirit be the God of your Spirit, &s;o &s;hall we be united in him, and jointly partake of his Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s through Eternity!</P>
<P>Ah, I cried, can I forego the divine Precepts of our Prophet? Your Prophet, &s;ays &s;he, preaches only to the Eye and the Ear, and this is all that he does or can pre|tend to: But <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> my Prophet, preaches, in the Heart, to the Affections. From him is every good Motion divine or hu|man, He is the unknown God of your Spirit, my Ma&s;ter, my <HI>Abenamin,</HI> and you feel his precious Power while you di&s;avow his Name.</P>
<P>I was puzzled, I was &s;ilenced. I bent a Knee in Reverence, ki&s;&s;ed her Hand, and withdrew.</P>
<P>I &s;ent for the Chief of the Chri&s;tian Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, throughout the City and Country. I con&s;ulted Each of them in private, but received no Satisfaction from them. They All appeared equally zealous for my Refor|mation,
<PB N="325" REF="326">but attempted it by different and even by oppo&s;ite Arguments.</P>
<P>Some would have per&s;uaded me to be Chri&s;tian, by &s;hewing the Ab&s;urdity of every Religion that was not Chri&s;tian. Others affirmed that my eternal Salvation depended on my Conformity to certain ex|ternal Rules and Penances. While the greate&s;t Number inveighed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians of every other Denomination; and would have thru&s;t me wholly from Chri&s;t, if I did not con&s;ent to receive him within their &s;tinted Pale.</P>
<P>I knew not what to do: I was put to a Stand, and quite confu&s;ed by this Multi|plicity of conflicting Opinions. At length, a Countryman of my own came to me from the De&s;art. He had been a great Sinner, but was converted by the Sen&s;e of his Sins, and he was revered and re&s;orted to by All the Friendle&s;s and Afflicted.</P>
<P>I opened my Soul to him, with all its Doubts and Difficulties.&mdash;My Friend in CHRIST, &s;aid he, with a gentle and &s;till Voice, they have been leading you all a|&s;tray, quite away from the Haven that &s;tretches forth its Arms for the Reception of long toiled Mariners, whom Storms have, at length, compelled to &s;eek a final Port.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="327">
The God of your Creation can alone be your Redemption, the God of your Nature can alone be the Salvation of the Nature that he imparted. But, who &s;hall convince you of this? Not all the Angels in Heaven, nor all the Doctors upon Earth, till the Chri&s;t of your Heart &s;hall be plea&s;ed to convince you that you are, as indeed you are (however mighty a Monarch) a poor, frail, erring, vile, and de&s;picable Creature; &s;ubjected to innumerable Lap&s;es and Infirmi|ties, Sickne&s;s, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Cro&s;&s;es, Griefs, Agonies and Death. When this is effec|tually done, the Whole of the Bu&s;ine&s;s is done. You will call for and catch at a Sa|viour, in the Sen&s;ibility of your Want of him. When you come thus laden with your Sins to him, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t you out. But he will take you, as <HI>Noah</HI> took the wearied Dove into the Ark. He will take you within the Veil of his own Temple of Re&s;t, and all Sects, Forms, and Ceremonies will be as the outward Courts, with which you &s;hall have no Manner of Commerce or Concern.</P>
<P>My Heart felt the Weight and the Ful|ne&s;s of Conviction. I took him to my Arms and reque&s;ted in&s;tant Bapti&s;m. My <HI>Eloi&s;a</HI> was called, we locked our&s;elves in. And I was wa&s;hed by Water and Faith in|to Chri&s;t, while my kneeling Angel wept a Stream of Delight be&s;ide me.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="328">
It is &s;aid that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cloys. But I ex|perienced, my dear <HI>D'Aubigny,</HI> that Love never cloys. Every Day, with my <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> &s;eemed to triumph, in heart-felt Happi|ne&s;s, over my fir&s;t bridal Day. But O, what was the Joy, the Exultation of my fond Heart, when &s;he gave me to be the Father of a little Daughter of Paradi&s;e!</P>
<P>One Day, while we were toying and fool|ing with the &s;miling Infant, and throwing her, as &s;he crowed, from the One to the Other. Ah, my Hu&s;band, cries <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> how poor I was lately, no Parents, no Kindred, nothing but my <HI>Abenamin</HI> upon the whole Earth; and now God has been plea&s;ed to make my Affliction to laugh, and to give this Babe for a further Band, a precious Link of Love between us.</P>
<P>He was ju&s;t in this Part of his Narrati|on, when the Mu&s;ic &s;ounded to the Ban|quet. We in&s;tantly ro&s;e and joined our <HI>Eloi&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>When the Collation was removed. Ma|dam, &s;aid I to the Empre&s;s, have you ever heard of a Relation, of yours, chri&s;tened by the Name of <HI>Fanny Goodall,</HI> and lately Counte&s;s of <HI>Maitland?</HI> I have, &s;aid &s;he, often heard my fond Father &s;peak of her with filling Eyes.

<PB N="328" REF="329">She is no longer Counte&s;s of <HI>Mait|land.</HI> She is now doubly your Relation, your Aunt as well as your Cou&s;in, and goes by the Title of the Marchione&s;s <HI>D'Aubigny.</HI> With the good Leave of my Lord here, I will bring her to you directly.</P>
<P>I went to the Palace appointed for my Re&s;idence: I there gave my <HI>Fanny</HI> a few Heads of the Story of our <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> and took her ha&s;tily to the Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Ladies looked at Each other, in long and &s;ilent Admiration. Then, open|ing their Arms, and ru&s;hing together, they continued &s;ome Minutes locked in mutual Embraces.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid the Emperor, &s;miling, I think I ought to be allowed the &s;ame Li|berties with my Aunt, that your Hu&s;band took with his Niece. Whereon, he wel|comed and care&s;&s;ed her with an affectionate Fervour.</P>
<P>O, exclaimed the royal Fair, how very poor, and how very rich our God can &s;ud|denly make us! But then, Lord of my Life, to think of parting, of parting with the&s;e dear Friends again, perhaps never to &s;ee them more, that's what &s;inks and wrings my Heart, in the very Mid&s;t of Exultation!</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="330">
That, my Love, &s;aid the Emperor, is the very important Article on which I wi&s;h to con&s;ult with you and our Friends here, our dear Kindred in Chri&s;t. But I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;hew them their young Relation, my little Enchantre&s;s, my pricele&s;s Pearl, my Eye delighting <HI>Abenaide.</HI></P>

<P>She did as &s;he was ordered, and in|&s;tantly broke upon my Sight, like a new Glory ari&s;en upon Mid-day.</P>
<P>My <HI>Fanny</HI> &s;eized upon her, as de&s;irous of devouring her.

<PB N="330" REF="331">She &s;eized our Hands and, ki&s;&s;ing them, cried, What a ble&s;&s;ed Day is this, that enriches <HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> with two Parents more; another precious Father, and ano|ther lovely Mother, happy, happy <HI>Abe|naid&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P>Her royal Father then gave a Beck, and &s;he in&s;tantly vani&s;hed; while her Ab&s;ence &s;eemed to ca&s;t a Shade throughout the Room.</P>
<P>The Monarch then, deeply mu&s;ing and heavily &s;ighing, began&mdash;I am now, my deare&s;t Friends, Friends beloved above the World and all that it contains, I am now to open to you my inmo&s;t Heart, and to reveal a Purpo&s;e whereon I have been ruminating the&s;e many Months, but could not hit on an Expedient for bringing it to pa&s;s. How opportune has our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;ent you to us on this Occa&s;ion!</P>
<P>I have but the two Children living; my <HI>Abenaid&egrave;,</HI> and a Son, by a former Woman of my Seraglio. His Name is <HI>Abencorrage;</HI> he is a Youth renowned in the Field, but of a proud and impetuous Demeanour. He had long conceived an illicit Pa&s;&s;ion for his young and lovely Si&s;ter. At length the Fire broke forth, and he lately at|tempted her Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="332">
I would in&s;tantly have put him to death, had I any other Heir to &s;ucceed to my Do|minions. I therefore contented my&s;elf with bani&s;hing him my Court and my Pre&s;ence, though I am &s;en&s;ible that this has not availed for the extingui&s;hing his horrid Flame.</P>
<P>Now, my Friends, &s;hould I die, or &s;hould this violent Boy break into Rebel|lion, for he is the Favourite of the licen|tious Soldiery, I tremble to think what would become of my bright eyed Dove, within the Talons of &s;uch a Vulture.</P>
<P>This, together with my eager De&s;ire of quitting a Kingdom of Infidels, and of join|ing with the ble&s;&s;ed Society and Commu|nion of Saints, has, after &s;ome Struggles, determined me to abdicate my Throne, as &s;oon as I can ama&s;s and tran&s;mit a Fund &s;ufficient for &s;upporting my <HI>Eloi&s;a</HI> and my|&s;elf, with becoming Dignity, in her native Country.</P>
<P>Ah, my Lord, I cried, cla&s;ping him pa&s;|&s;ionately in my Arms, regard not your Trea&s;ures, delay not a Moment for that! your <HI>Eloi&s;a</HI>'s Relations, both by Father and Mother, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of princely Fortunes, and they will all be freely at the Di&s;po&s;al of your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="333">
Ah, my <HI>D'Aubigny,</HI> &s;aid he, I am not yet &s;o duely mortified a Chri&s;tian as need|le&s;ly to elect a State of Dependance, or willingly to de&s;cend at once from the King to the Beggar. I have however been pre|paring: I have already converted a large Part of my Effects into Bills and Jewels, of high Value but light Portage, to the a|mount, as I think, of about Sixty Million of <HI>French</HI> Money; this I will tran&s;mit by you, and as &s;oon as I &s;hall have com|pa&s;&s;ed an equal Sum, I will &s;tay no longer in <HI>Africa,</HI> I will fly to your Bo&s;oms, my precious Friends.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, this violent and lu&s;t|ful Boy gives no Re&s;t to my Apprehen|&s;ions. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that I com|mit my <HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> to your Tru&s;t. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I &s;ay, that I tear away my choice&s;t Limb, the deare&s;t Part of my Vitals! Sup|port me, Chri&s;t, in the Trial, but it mu&s;t be gone through.</P>
<P>This, however, mu&s;t be done with all po&s;&s;ible Privacy. I am per&s;uaded that my young Villain has his Spies in and about my Palace. I &s;hall therefore reque&s;t my dear Aunt, to di&s;gui&s;e my little Girl in Boy's Apparel, and to blacken every Part of her vi&s;ible Complexion, that &s;he may pa&s;s unnoticed, as your Page, through the
<PB N="333" REF="334">Mid&s;t of my Attendants. As al&s;o that it may prove, during the Travels of my Darling, a Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and any further Attempt tending to Violation.</P>
<P>At length the Time approached and pre&s;&s;ed for my Departure, but how to part was the Que&s;tion. All Attendants were ordered to avoid the Pre&s;ence, far away. Our metamorpho&s;ed <HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> &s;tood weeping be&s;ide us, while her Father and Mother cru&s;hed us, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to their Bo&s;oms. All was Pa&s;&s;ion, a Gu&s;h of Tears, but not a Word was uttered on any Part.</P>
<P>O, my <HI>D'Aubigny,</HI> cried the Emperor at length, Friend, Brother of my Heart, can you conceive what I feel at this In&s;tant? I regard not the World, nor the Things of the World. Omit &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Accom|modations as are common to us with Brutes; and All, belonging to the immortal and di|vine Humanity of Man, is Magneti&s;m, is Fellow&s;hip, the Feeling, as of Steel to Adamant, and of Adamant to Steel. There is the Friend&s;hip, the Endearment, the Love, pa&s;&s;ing Love, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all other Enjoyment. If we meet again, my <HI>D'Au|bigny,</HI> I &s;hall anticipate my Heaven!</P>
<P>Again, he embraced his little Angel, and again he embraced his Queen, and
<PB N="334" REF="335">be&s;ought her to be comforted. We then took Leave, as for the la&s;t; and again they called us back, and embraced and took Leave again; till, &s;eeing no End, I &s;udden|ly broke away, hurrying with us our <HI>Abenaid&egrave;,</HI> for fear of Ob&s;ervation. I for|got, however, to tell You that, the Day before our Departure, the royal <HI>Abenamin</HI> had enjoined me to &s;et apart twenty Mil|lion of Livres, for the Portion of his Child, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould be married to any great Prince or Potentate, reque&s;ting me, at the &s;ame Time, not to put any Con&s;traint on the Inclinations of his Lamb.</P>
<P>I have little further to &s;ay, my Brother. We arrived &s;afe at <HI>Paris,</HI> where we receiv|ed your Letter; and, impatient to make you happy, I di&s;patched my <HI>Fanny</HI> with her Train and your <HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> before me; enjoining them, however, not to reveal our Secret till my Arrival. For, as I had charged my&s;elf with the Lo&s;s of your <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> I deemed my&s;elf be&s;t entitled to make you Reparation in Per&s;on. But, I ought not to omit that, before I left <HI>Paris,</HI> I received a further Remittance of twenty Million from your Son-in-law, &s;o that we may &s;peedily look to have the royal Pair in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after, a Po&s;t Chai&s;e whirled into the Court, and <HI>Harry,</HI> flying out, caught <HI>Clement</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> into his &s;trict Embrace.
<PB N="335" REF="336">He then hurried them in, where Mr. <HI>Clin|ton</HI> received and care&s;&s;ed, and introduced them to the Duke and Dutche&s;s, as Per|&s;ons of great Merit, and his highly valued Friends. He then pre&s;ented to them his <HI>Abenaid&egrave;,</HI> who accordingly &s;aluted <HI>Clement,</HI> and embraced <HI>Arabella</HI> with an affectionate Familiarity.</P>
<P>O Sir, cried our Hero, ki&s;&s;ing his Un|cle's Hand, am I to be the la&s;t Per&s;on in the World, whom you will honour with a Sa|lute from your bewitching Daughter? I a&s;k your Pardon, my Lord, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> (&s;olemnly) Allow me then, at length, to repair my Omi&s;&s;ion by pre&s;enting to your Earl&s;hip her little Highne&s;s <HI>Abenaid&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke and Dutche&s;s and <HI>Meekly</HI> laughed. But <HI>Harry</HI> was not a whit the &s;lower in laying hold of his Advantage. He ki&s;&s;ed her Forehead, her Eyes, her Cheeks, and la&s;tly dwelt upon her Lips, as though he would have infu&s;ed his Soul be|tween them. <HI>Harry, Harry,</HI> cried Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> I will never introduce you to my Girl again, unle&s;s you promi&s;e not to ki&s;s &s;o hard and bring &s;o much Blood into her Face.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then a Footman entered; My Lord, &s;ays he to <HI>Harry,</HI> here are three Carriages and &s;everal Hor&s;emen waiting
<PB N="336" REF="337">without the Gate, they enquire for one Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton</HI> who, they &s;ay, lives with the Earl of <HI>Moreland,</HI> but I a&s;&s;ured them there was no &s;uch Per&s;on in the Hou&s;e. O Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> the&s;e are our old Friends the <HI>Fieldings,</HI> and out he flew.</P>
<P>As he approached the Carriages, the Company gave a Shout of Joy. Why, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> a Servant denied you to us, and &s;aid that no One of the Name of <HI>Fenton</HI> lived here. O, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> don't heed the Puppy, he is but a new Comer.</P>
<P>He then opened the Doors of the Car|riages, and handed and ki&s;&s;ed them, in Turns, as they came out, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> the reverend Mr. <HI>Catharines</HI> and his &s;ainted <HI>Phaebe,</HI> and <HI>Ned</HI> and his bloom|ing Bride.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> received them at the Door, with the Joy of his Heart apparent in his Countenance. He then introduced them to his mo&s;t noble Brother and Si&s;ter, to his Friend <HI>Meekly,</HI> and la&s;tly he pre&s;ented his <HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> to them, on whom they all gazed in mute and reverential A&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then ob&s;erving that his Uncle had not equally pre&s;ented his Daughter to <HI>Ned.</HI> Sir, &s;ays he, I apprehend that this is not quite fair; I have already ki&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="337" REF="338">fair Bride of my Friend, with all my Heart, and it is but hone&s;t that he &s;hould be fa|voured with a Salute from Mine, in turn.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then took <HI>Ned</HI> by the Hand and pre&s;ented him to his Beloved. While <HI>Ned</HI> bent the Knee, and touching her Hand tremblingly, looked awfully to her Face, and &s;aid: Yes, Bride of <HI>Eden,</HI> lovely Ex|tract of every Beauty! You alone can re|ward, You alone can de&s;erve him, You alone are fitted to be the Mate of my in|comparable Lord and Ma&s;ter, my Patron and Pre&s;erver! So &s;aying, he lightly touch|ed his Lips to the poli&s;hed Hand. But the Prai&s;es of her <HI>Harry</HI> had gone, with a plea|&s;ant Trickling, to the Heart of <HI>Abenaid&egrave;,</HI> and, gently rai&s;ing <HI>Ned,</HI> &s;he affectionately &s;aluted him, with a gli&s;tening Eye.</P>
<P>Pray Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> whi&s;pering|ly, to Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> is the Earl of <HI>Moreland</HI> in Company?&mdash;That is he, Sir, point|ing to <HI>Harry.</HI>&mdash;O then, cried <HI>Field|ing,</HI> he is titled below his Merits, it was for an Emperor that Nature intended him.</P>
<P>Dinner was then &s;erved.&mdash;During the Repa&s;t the Duke &s;aid, Let us not, my Brother, keep our <HI>Harry</HI> in Pain: Why &s;hould we delay the Happine&s;s of Children &s;o very dear to us? With Regard to your Child's Marriage to &s;ome mighty Prince,
<PB N="338" REF="339">as your Son-in-law hinted, I think her more ennobled and more illu&s;trious, by her Marriage with our Hero here, who pur|cha&s;ed her, at his Peril, than if &s;he were mated to the greate&s;t Potentate on Earth.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, my noble Brother, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> I will have no clande&s;tine Doings in this Bu&s;ine&s;s. My Girl &s;hall be married in the Face and witne&s;&s;ing of Thou|&s;ands; left hereafter, this young Rogue &s;hould have the Effrontery to deny her. What Day of the Week is this, <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> I think, let <HI>Monday</HI> Sennight be the Day!</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> ro&s;e and pre&s;s'd and ki&s;s'd the Hand of the Duke with Rapture, and then ki&s;&s;ed the Hand of his Patron in &s;ilent Sub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They kept the <HI>Fieldings</HI> with them for three Days. But <HI>Harry</HI> would not part with his <HI>Clement,</HI> nor <HI>Abenaid&egrave;</HI> with <HI>Ara|bella</HI> till the Marriage &s;hould be over. <HI>Harry,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of the&s;e two Friends, attempted to take &s;ome little accu&s;tomed Liberties, under her Name of <HI>Abenamin.</HI> But, the Proprietor of his Heart &s;weetly repul&s;ed him and cried, No, no, hone&s;t Friend, I will box with you whenever, and as often as you plea&s;e, but, no more wre&s;tling, my <HI>Harry!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="340">
In the mean Time, all Preparations were pu&s;hed into Forwardne&s;s by Mr. <HI>Clinton.</HI> The many Shops of the many Towns, within many Miles around, were emptied of their Boards and Sheeting, their Knives and Forks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thou&s;ands of Tables and Forms were framed, Thou|&s;ands of Tents were erected. Proclamati|on was made in every Village, and all Peo|ple, within thirty Miles, invited to the Wedding.</P>
<P>When the Day approached, one hundred Oxen were &s;lain, five hundred Sheep, three hundred Swine, with fifty fat Deer, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> The Spits fried, and the Cauldrons &s;moak|ed over the Fires of many a Field.</P>
<P>At length the au&s;picious Morning ro&s;e; and <HI>Harry</HI> and his Bride were already up and dre&s;&s;ed in their re&s;pective Apartments. <HI>Harry</HI> wore a Jacket and Drawers of white Satin. His Locks flowed through a Knot of oriental Pearl. And a Mantle of purple Velvet, embroidered with Needle wrought Flowers of Gold, hung over his left Shoul|der, and came under the right Arm in floating Skirts, joined at the Ends by a Buckle of Carbuncles.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s was habited, after the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Fa&s;hion, in a Ve&s;t of Silver Brocading,
<PB N="340" REF="341">&s;collop'd over a Petticoat of the &s;ame Fa|bric, that flowed in a Train behind. A Scarf of cerulean Tint flew between her right Shoulder and her left Hip, being buttoned at each End by a Ro&s;e of Rubies. Her &s;hining Tre&s;&s;es of jetty Black, bound toge|ther at her Neck beneath a huge Amethy&s;t, fell down in luxuriant Ringlets, and &s;haded and revealed, by Turns, the fine Bend of her tapering Wai&s;t. A Coronet of Dia|monds, through which there waved a white Branch of the Feathers of the E&s;trich, was in&s;erted on the left Decline of her lovely Head. And a Stomacher of ine&s;timable Brilliants ro&s;e beneath her dazzling Bo&s;om, and, by a fluctuating Blaze of unremitted Glory, checked and turned the Eye away from too pre&s;umptuous a Gaze.</P>
<P>Our Hero, coming forth, beheld her, as a Pillar of Fire, ju&s;t i&s;&s;uing from her Antichamber. He &s;tepped back, as &s;he advanced, and fixed his Eyes upon her in mute A&s;toni&s;hment; then &s;pringing for|ward he fell pro&s;trate and ki&s;&s;ed the Hem of her Robeing. Again ri&s;ing on one Knee, he lifted his Hands toward Heaven, and his Eyes to her glowing Countenance. Oppre&s;&s;ive Power of Beauty! he cried, O, may every Day ri&s;e, like this, on my Soul-enrapturing <HI>Abenaid&egrave;,</HI> encircling her with Friend&s;hip, Love, and Joy, and the Knee of admiring Thou&s;ands!</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="342">
<HI>Arabella</HI> attended her royal Friend, and <HI>Clement</HI> his noble Pupil, ju&s;t as <HI>Longfield</HI> entered to give an Account of his Expedi|tion. But, he had &s;carce begun his Detail, when, catching the Image that had long &s;ince made an Impre&s;&s;ion on his Heart, he &s;tarted and turned pale, and breaking off he cried, Ble&s;s me, my Lord, Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> I think! Yes, my <HI>Longfield,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> and here too is your old and fa&s;t Friend <HI>Hammel Clement. Clement</HI> would not have known <HI>Longfield</HI> in his pre&s;ent genteel Plight; but, hearing his Name, and recol|lecting him at a Glance, he flew and &s;eized upon him with a &s;trenuous Embrace. <HI>Arabella</HI> then advanced to welcome her old Friend; but poor <HI>Longfield</HI> re&s;pectfully bowed and &s;hrunk back.</P>
<P>You &s;hall not e&s;cape me &s;o, my dear Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> &s;ays &s;he; I cannot forget what I owe you, even my Life and Re|putation; and I ble&s;s the Father of Mercies, who has put it in our Power to pay Part of our Debt, and &s;o &s;aying &s;he embraced him with Freedom and Cordiality. Yes, my dear <HI>Longfield,</HI> cried <HI>Hammel,</HI> your's is the Half of our Fortunes, and more than the Half of our Hearts. Your Heart, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Longfield,</HI> will ever be mo&s;t valuable; but as to any Thing additional, the Bounty of
<PB N="342" REF="343">my young Ma&s;ter has rendered all further Fortune quite &s;uperfluous to me.</P>
<P><HI>Longfield</HI> then beckoned his Lord forth, that he might relate to his Eye, rather than to his Ear, the Succe&s;s of his Commi&s;&s;ion. They ha&s;tened to a long Barn, where he &s;hewed <HI>Harry</HI> two Ranges of beautiful Chil|dren, One of a hundred cho&s;en Girls, A|nother of a hundred cho&s;en Boys, All dre&s;&s;ed in a clean and elegant Uniform. <HI>Harry</HI> walked between the Ranks, his Heart ex|ulting in the Sen&s;e of its own divine Hu|manity. Then, embracing his Agent, Yes, my <HI>Longfield,</HI> he cried, The&s;e &s;hall be in|deed my Children; and I will prove a true and affectionate Father to them. But let us ha&s;ten to be&s;tow upon them a tender Mother too, I tru&s;t.</P>
<P>He flew back, as a Glimp&s;e of Lighten|ing, and &s;eizing and half devouring the Hand of his Bride, Will you pardon me, my Beloved, &s;ays he, &s;ome Matters that happened before our Union? I have col|lected all the Children I ever had before Marriage. I &s;corn any Thing that is clan|de&s;tine. They wait for your In&s;pection; and I hope that you will not prove a hard Stepmother to them. You are a Rogue, &s;ays &s;he, archly &s;miling, and giving him a Pat on the Cheek; but come along, and &s;o &s;aying, away they tripped.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="344">
The Prince&s;s walked, with a &s;ilent and mu&s;ing Attention, up and down the Ranges. Her Heart grew &s;trongly affected, and, taking out her Handkerchief, &s;he wiped away the dropping Tear. And has my Lord, &s;ays &s;he to <HI>Longfield,</HI> has he in|deed taken upon him to be a Father to all this pretty Ho&s;t of Little Ones? He has, &s;o plea&s;e your Highne&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Longfield,</HI> and has accordingly cloathed and provid|ed for them. O, &s;he cried, under the FA|THER, which is in Heaven, he is the dear|e&s;t and &s;weete&s;t Father that ever was upon Earth! So exclaiming, &s;he &s;prung at <HI>Harry,</HI> and notwith&s;tanding her late Coyne&s;s, &s;carce vouch&s;afing a Hand to his Lips, &s;he now grappled about his Neck, half &s;mothering him with the Repetition of her Ki&s;&s;es and Care&s;&s;es; and then thru&s;ting her Face into his Bo&s;om, &s;he vented her Pa&s;&s;ion in Tears.</P>
<P>On their Return, they perceived Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> the Duke and Dutche&s;s, all &s;tand|ing in the great folding Door, and flying up the marble Steps, they Both bent the Knee, and received the joint Ble&s;&s;ings and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Care&s;&s;es of their three exulting Parents.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then <HI>Harry</HI> &s;pied Goodman <HI>Dob&s;on</HI> and his Dame coming diffidently but puff|ingly
<PB N="344" REF="345">up the Avenue. In&s;tantly he caught his Angel by the Hand and ha&s;tened to meet them. He took them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ed them with warm Af|fection, while with yearning Hearts and Bowels, they wi&s;hed him Joy upon Joy. They then kneeled down on each Side of the Prince&s;s, ki&s;&s;ing her Hands and Gar|ments, and ble&s;&s;ing her for be&s;towing &s;uch a Heaven of Beauty upon their <HI>Harry.</HI> But, as &s;oon as <HI>Harry</HI> told her that they were his Fo&s;terers, his very dear Daddy and Mammy; &s;he rai&s;ed and ki&s;&s;ed them, in turns, with her Arms about their Necks; and be&s;ought them to be her Daddy and Mammy al&s;o; for, alas, &s;ays &s;he, my Daddy and Mammy are far away. <HI>Harry</HI> then gave them into the Hands of his Man <HI>Jack,</HI> with Orders to take them to the Larder.</P>
<P>The Multitude, before this, began to thicken apace. And the Youth had got together in the great Lawn, ca&s;ting the Coit and the Sledge, and leaping over a Cord that was rai&s;ed between two Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>My lovely <HI>Harry,</HI> cried the Duke, I have heard Things, almo&s;t incredible, of your Prowe&s;s and Action, but never &s;aw any Sample &s;ave the mounting of your <HI>Bucephealus.</HI> Will you be &s;o good to give
<PB N="345" REF="346">me &s;ome In&s;tance of your Excellence among yonder young Competitors, whom I &s;uppo&s;e to be the mo&s;t eminent that the Shire can exhibit? Do, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> cla&s;ping and ki&s;&s;ing him, indulge my dear|e&s;t Brother on this our Day of Jubilee.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> bowed, and ordered <HI>Jack</HI> to bring him his Quarter&s;taff, and di&s;patched Ano|ther for a Cord and two long Poles. He then walked down the Avenue, attended by the Males and Females of the whole Family.</P>
<P>As they approached the Lawn, a Youth, of uncommon Vigour, had cleared the former Cord, though rai&s;ed to &s;omething upward of five Feet in Height, but All, who attempted to follow, either recoiled or pitched over.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then cau&s;ed his two Poles to be erected to an Elevation of ten Feet, with a Cord reaching from Top to Top. The Multitude came down, in Thou&s;ands, to &s;ee what they were about. When <HI>Harry,</HI> having cleared the conte&s;ted Cord with a &s;tanding Hop, went backward from his lofty Poles, about the Di&s;tance of thirty Paces; then, ru&s;hing forward, he advanced one End of his Staff to the Ground, and &s;pringing, and rai&s;ing, and ri&s;ing upon the
<PB N="346" REF="347">oppo&s;ite End, he pitched him&s;elf over the elevated String, while the Multitude be|held him, as a new ri&s;en Phenix, &s;u&s;pend|ed and glittering in the Air, and then a|lighting, as winged, on the other Side.</P>
<P>The Elements were rent by a univer&s;al Shout, which followed and undulated after our Company, till they &s;heltered them&s;elves within the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fieldings</HI> then arrived, with the reverable Mr. <HI>Catharines,</HI> who was ap|pointed to join the angelic Pair.</P>
<P>After Breakfa&s;t, the Carriages were or|dered out. Fir&s;t, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> and his <HI>Meekly</HI> moved away, in Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI>'s Coach and Six to the Church. The Family of the <HI>Fieldings</HI> then followed, in a Coach and Six, and two Chariots. Next went <HI>Clement</HI> and his <HI>Arabella,</HI> in their Po&s;t Chai&s;e and Four. The Duke and Dutche&s;s then &s;uc|ceeded, in a &s;umptuous Coach proudly drawn by Six <HI>German</HI> Greys, attended by a long Retinue of <HI>French</HI> Liveries, and the Dutche&s;s's Women in a Coach and Four. La&s;t advanced the Prince&s;s's four faithful <HI>Moors,</HI> mounted on fiery Cour&s;ers, and All gli&s;tering in <HI>Barbaric</HI> Gems and Adorn|ments. And la&s;t of all came our Hero and his <HI>Abenaid&egrave;,</HI> enthroned in her open Cha|riot,
<PB N="347" REF="348">as two Pearls of the Orient in a Ca&s;e of burni&s;hed Gold; her &s;ix &s;potted <HI>Arabians,</HI> re&s;training their Impatience, beat Mea&s;ures with their Feet, &s;carce &s;eeming to advance the Pace of a Tortoi&s;e. Never will any Sight &s;o glorious be exhibited, till the heavenly <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;hall de&s;cend upon Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI>'s <HI>Jack</HI> clo&s;ed the Rear, mounted on his Lord's rhone Charger, who &s;tepped foaming behind the Chariot; and the long Cavalcade nearly reached from the great Hotel to the Entrance of the Town.</P>
<P>The Crowd, however, extended wide and far beyond the Cavalcade. They bowed re&s;pectfully and payed Obey&s;ance to Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> the Duke, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they pa&s;&s;ed; but as &s;oon as they got a Glimp&s;e of the Chariot of their young <HI>Phaeton,</HI> their Acclamations became unremitted and al|mo&s;t in&s;ufferable to the Ear, like the Shouts of a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Army at the ri&s;ing of the Sun.</P>
<P>Slowly as our <HI>Harry</HI> moved, the Mul|titude &s;trove to retard him, by throwing them&s;elves in his Way, that they might &s;atiate their Eyes and Souls with the Ful|ne&s;s of Beauty. Bended Knees and lifted Hands, Prayers, Ble&s;&s;ings, and Exclamati|ons
<PB N="348" REF="349">were hear'd, and &s;een on all Sides; and, all the Way as they went, Thou&s;ands, upon Tens of Thou&s;ands, &s;houted forth the Hymeneal of the cele&s;tial Pair!</P>
