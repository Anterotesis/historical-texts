<HEAD>I. ELECTRICAL AETHER! OR, AN AGGREGATE COMPOUND OF THE MOST ACTIVE FACULTIES OF THE MATERIAL SOUL OF THE UNIVERSE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS admirable Compo&s;ition is one of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ubtil e&s;&s;ences in nature. It is a combination, or concen|tration of all her elementary powers, and vivifying influences: be|ing an e&s;&s;ence extracted by air, magneti&s;m, and the electrical or cele&s;tial fire, from the riche&s;t oriental aromatics, &amp;c. with the balmie&s;t and mo&s;t active aether. A few of the riche&s;t, milde&s;t, and mo&s;t cordial roots, barks, &s;eeds, flowers, fruits, gums and bal&s;ams, which flow into this great metropolis from the four quar|ters of the globe, e&s;pecially tho&s;e from A&s;ia, and the choice&s;t of the Briti&s;h &s;imples, are under my own immediate in&s;pection &s;elected, properly prepared, and put into ma&s;&s;y gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els, and upon them is poured a due quantity of the fine&s;t aetherial &s;pirit. They are then placed in one of the great metallic globes on the dome of the electrical Temples of Health and of Hymen, in the Apollo and other apartments of tho&s;e GREAT and mo&s;t u&s;eful In&s;titutions, to be acted upon by the cele&s;tial fire, &amp;c. and la&s;tly, the e&s;&s;ence is purified by filtration upon a new principle, which prevents all po&s;&s;ibility of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t volatile parts evaporating.</P>
<P>The globes are entirely lined with metal in the in&mdash;as well as on the out&s;ide. They are twelve in number, each containing full thirty-&s;ix gallons. The gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els too, are covered with metal, inclo&s;ed in curious magnetic ca&s;es, and their &s;toppers are pierced with gla&s;s tubes and thick metal rods, which end in a multitude of points, from which &s;treams of the electrical fire, &amp;c.&mdash;are conti|nually pouring in upon the aether and aromatics, in luminous and mo&s;t glorious &s;treams.</P>
<P>The immen&s;e quantity of this vivifying re&s;torative fire, &amp;c. which is accumulated in the&s;e Temples, flows thus into the medicines through the rods and tubes above-mentioned, which with the magnetic efflu|vium pa&s;&s;es even through the out&s;ide of the gla&s;&s;es, &amp;c. to the &s;ub|&s;tances contained in them: for each of the four great globes be|comes
<PB N="3" REF="3">a genial, <HI>cool</HI> OVEN, glowing with the plenitude of the&s;e &s;a|lutary, vital, and harmonious influences.</P>
<P>By this curious and mo&s;t wonderful proce&s;s, like every operation which I perform on my patients, with this, or with any other part of my a&s;toni&s;hing and tremendous apparatus, (which, altoge|ther, in both the Temples, occupies in fact twenty rooms) I have it in ab&s;olute command and &s;ubjection acting arbitrarily or at plea&s;ure on the medicines,&mdash;on my patients&mdash;or on any part of their body or limbs particularly affected, in any quantity, or with any degree of power, according to the nature of the &s;ub&s;tances, or as the various con&s;titutions, &amp;c.&mdash;of my patients require: in &s;hort, the whole of the apparatus employed in making the three Great Medicines men|tioned in this De&s;cription, if &s;olid metal, would weigh con&s;iderably above &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds. After the above account of the compo&s;ition and preparation of the electrical aether, it would be quite unnece&s;&s;ary for me to dwell on its manifold and &s;urprizing virtues. Philo&s;ophers, phy&s;icians and chemi&s;ts mu&s;t plainly &s;ee, that by the above means, a rich, yet SIMPLE <HI>homogene,</HI> and VI|VIFYING QUINTESSENCE mu&s;t be produced,&mdash;an utter enemy to di&s;ea&s;es and corruption,&mdash;and a cordial peace-maker in all &s;trife and di&s;cord in the human body! The&s;e facts mu&s;t be too obvious to <HI>every</HI> per&s;on of even a very common under&s;tanding, to require commenting upon. I &s;hall ju&s;t &s;ay that for preventing every &s;pe|cies of infection, and for curing all low, nervous, lingering and putrid di&s;ea&s;es, nothing on earth can equal this mo&s;t noble quin|te&s;&s;ence which I chu&s;e to call, &s;imply,&mdash;<HI>Electrical Aether;</HI> and as it is much ea&s;ier and wi&s;er to prevent di&s;ea&s;es, than to cure them, I &s;hall point out, very briefly, its u&s;es in the fir&s;t place as a pre|ventive.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, all per&s;ons who frequent public places, and who regard their health, ought never to be without a vial of the electri|cal aether, even in their pocket&mdash;tho&s;e e&s;pecially who are &s;ubject to catch colds and dangerous di&s;orders,&mdash;or who have weakne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ions at their brea&s;t and &s;tomach,&mdash;or a nervous &s;y&s;tem irri|table and relaxed.</P>
<P>It is well known, by every per&s;on who knows any thing at all of medicine or philo&s;ophy, that the air of any place after it has been breathed, and charged with the phlogi&s;ticated or mephitic breath, per&s;piration, &amp;c. of even the cleane&s;t, &s;ounde&s;t and healthie&s;t per&s;ons, &mdash;becomes not only altogether unfit for re&s;piration, but likewi&s;e ab&s;o|utely and highly poi&s;onous. But how much more dangerous and un|whole&s;ome mu&s;t it be, to draw into our lungs, perhaps for &s;everal hours together, the foul and putrid exhalations which reek from the dirty bo|dies and garments&mdash;&s;ecret &s;ores&mdash;and corrupted lungs crammed up in places of public amu&s;ement!&mdash;I am not at all &s;urprized at the &s;evere di&s;ea&s;es and &s;udden deaths which happen among both young and
<PB N="4" REF="4">old. No; but I am a&s;toni&s;hed that MANY MORE do not happen; and that &s;o many rational beings &s;hould &s;ubmit to the drudgery and danger, not to mention the expence, of attending crouded &mdash;non&s;en&s;ical&mdash;public places. But as it is in vain to oppo&s;e the ty|rannic force of fa&s;hion, or to &s;hake off the mighty influence of HABIT, which, with ab&s;olute &s;way govern every thing that hath the breath of life, I would advi&s;e every prudent per&s;on before they go into &s;uch places to fortify their body, and harmonize their mind, with taking a tea &s;poonful of the electrical aether, or nervous aethe|rial bal&s;am on &s;ugar, or in any thing they like be&s;t&mdash;and even to &s;mell now and then to the former in &s;uch places when they &s;u&s;|pect danger, or when they find them&s;elves languid or oppre&s;&s;ed. &mdash;By the&s;e precautions, many hundreds of the nobility and gentry in Europe, experience daily from it the happie&s;t effects; and when they return home faint, relaxed and exhau&s;ted, from over heated rooms, public or private; from enervating indulgencies too, <HI>(in &s;acrificing to Venus or Bacchus)</HI> or from violent agitations of body and of mind&mdash;they are pre&s;ently refre&s;hed, recruited, compo&s;ed, and invigorated by &s;mel|ling to the electrical aether for a few minutes, by taking a tea &s;poonful or two of IT, (OR RATHER, of the nervous aetherial bal&s;am) in a gla&s;s of brandy,&mdash;of wine,&mdash;or of cold water:&mdash;or even by pouring a lit|tle of the electrical aether into a ba&s;on or quart mug half filled with hot water, coffee, green tea, or an infu&s;ion of aromatic Bri|ti&s;h herbs, flowers, &amp;c. and breathing over it for a few minutes. By the&s;e means, under God! &s;weet, &s;ound, and refre&s;hing &s;leep, and mental tranquility, are with certainty procured,&mdash;and all po&s;&s;ibi|lity of di&s;ea&s;e or decay, effectually warded off:&mdash;and the&s;e happy effects are rendered &s;till more certain, kindly and la&s;ting, if the per&s;ons will wa&s;h or bathe their face, neck, hands, feet, and pri|vate parts&mdash;ESPECIALLY THE LATTER, with pure COLD water&mdash;or with milk and water&mdash;about blood warm. This &s;imple and de|lightful affair of bathing the private parts and fundament every night and morning, &s;ummer and winter, in &s;ickne&s;s and in health, in cold milk or water&mdash;is of more importance to the bodily health, youthful beauty, and &s;weet de&s;ireablene&s;s of men and WOMEN, than any thing I can po&s;&s;ibly mention or inculcate. If this mo&s;t &s;alutary practice of applying even partially, cold or at mo&s;t tepid water or milk, to the &s;urface of the body and limbs,&mdash;if &s;implicity, modera|tion, regularity and temperance, in the indulgence of every appe|tite, and in the gratification of every de&s;ire&mdash;in a word, if prudence, wi&s;dom, delicacy, virtue, and that genuine religion which flows warm and &s;ilent in an everla&s;ting and &s;upremely cordial circulation, between THE PERFECTION OF EVERY EXCELLENCE&mdash; THE ETERNAL SOURCE OF LIFE, LOVE, LIGHT AND HAPPINESS!&mdash;and the benevolent&mdash;the melting&mdash;the enlarged human brea&s;t!&mdash;If this &s;terling&mdash;this all-ble&s;&s;ing religion which knows no di&s;tinction of &s;ect, church, age or country&mdash;
<PB N="5" REF="5">and who&s;e &s;ignet of divinity is liberty, forbearance and univer&s;al love! &mdash; if the&s;e, with their white-robed attendants who came down from heaven and who will conduct us thither&mdash;namely, Inno|cence, Activity, and Peace&mdash;were permitted to direct and controul our thoughts, words and actions daily, from our birth to the la&s;t day of life&mdash;the image of God which he &s;tampt on mankind at their original creation would be in a great mea&s;ure recovered and pre|&s;erved&mdash;we &s;hould continue very long and very happily in this tran&s;i|ent&mdash;probationary &s;tate of exi&s;tence&mdash;a hundred years &s;eeming but as one &s;ummer's day, while with a gradual de&s;cent, we would glide gently and &s;weetly down the hill of life, under the &s;erene and lucid influence of its evening &s;ky.</P>
<P>Behold, here, in a few words, my courteous and intelligent rea|der, a complete &s;y&s;tem, or the whole Art of Health, beauty, love|line&s;s, long-life and happine&s;s, temporal and eternal; WHICH, if properly and con&s;tantly attended to, phy&s;icians and dignified clergy|men, would be almo&s;t as unnece&s;&s;ary in the world, as &s;oldiers and &s;olicitors; and as are &s;uch codes of laws and di&s;cipline, in church and in &s;tate as they are at pre&s;ent ADMINISTERED in almo&s;t every nation on earth,&mdash;which are in general dark, unrea&s;onable, unju&s;t and diaboli|cal, and extremely contradictory to the &s;pirit, and advancement of true religion, &s;ound policy, and of the Healing Art, however agreeable to the letter of the law, the canons of the churches, or the practice of the Royal Colleges of Phy&s;icians. Millions of the human &s;pe|cies have felt, and millions do now feel, too &s;en&s;ibly the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;O Law! O Phy&s;ic! O Divinity! when&mdash;when will you under go a nece&s;&s;ary ordeal&mdash;a thorough, a rational reformation I&mdash; As to WARS&mdash;I will not mention them; for my whole frame qui|vers with horror even at the thought of them.&mdash;Carnage!&mdash; bank-ruptcies, poverty! &mdash; deva&s;tation! &mdash;hunger and thir&s;t,&mdash;horrible ap|prehen&s;ions!&mdash;forced from our native land;&mdash;and all the&s;e for what? why, for the honor and Glory of the God of mercy and peace &mdash;for a punctilio of what is called national honor;&mdash;too often indeed for nothing at all&mdash;to obtain an eventual evil&mdash;or for the acqui&s;ition of the &s;hadow of a &s;hade. I could almo&s;t venture I think to prophecy, that the time will come, tho' perhaps it is very di&s;tant, when the in|tere&s;ts and differences of nations, and what is called the ballance of power, will be &s;ettled by le&s;s horrible&mdash;le&s;s unnatural&mdash;le&s;s diabolical means than fire and &s;word; and that the children of tho&s;e men, naval and military, who are now trained up to, and who glory in ruin and deva&s;tation, carnage, theft, depredation and murder, will be taught to adorn the &s;ciences, embelli&s;h the arts, or to illuminate the human mind&mdash;in&s;tead of hewing down like &s;avage mon&s;ters, their fellow creatures&mdash;or of eating up, like drones, the bread of the children of indu&s;try. But I beg pardon for making this digre&s;&s;ion; I beg pardon, I mean, of their Wor&s;hips and High Mightine&s;&s;es, the CLERGY!!! the HEROES or MEN OF WAR!! the LAWYERS! and the
<PB N="6" REF="6">phy&s;icians, and I will now return to fini&s;h the de&s;criptive &s;ketch of the nature and properties of my electrical aether.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of la&s;t winter I had frequent opportunities of ob|&s;erving the good effects of this e&s;&s;ence, and of the nervous aetherial bal&s;am, upon many Ladies and Gentlemen who were uncommonly &s;u&s;ceptible of the evils which ari&s;e from the cold rawne&s;s and fogs of this variable climate; occa&s;ioning rehumatic complaints in the joints, and &s;till more particularly in the head and face, with &s;wel|lings of the cheek and gums, &s;ore throats, and tickling defluxions on the brea&s;t and lungs. By the u&s;e of the&s;e two medicines, and by keeping the body open with the Imperial Pills, tho&s;e com|plaints which formerly had confined them almo&s;t con&s;tantly thro' the winter to the hou&s;e were happily prevented; and in others who were &s;eized as u&s;ual, the cough, &s;orene&s;s of the brea&s;t, fe|vers and inquietudes were &s;peedily carried off by the gentle and moderate u&s;e of the&s;e precious, and mo&s;t friendly medicines.</P>
<P>But the electrical aether is more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who attend courts of ju&s;tice, public meetings, &s;ick per&s;ons, and tho&s;e places where hundreds of common people are crammed up in the galleries, &amp;c. Nothing in nature <HI>is</HI> or <HI>can</HI> be equal to the electri|cal aether, the nervous aetherial bal&s;am, and the cool open air in curing all, even the very wor&s;t, and mo&s;t confirmed &s;pecies of low|nervous-putrid fevers; ulcerated and gangrenous &s;ore throats; the &s;mall-pox,&mdash;mortifications, and the whole tribe of putrid con|&s;umptive, drop&s;ical, &s;corbutic and paralytic di&s;orders. By only &s;mell|ing to, or breathing over the aether, and taking now and then a tea &s;poonful of it, or of the bal&s;am in a cup of white wine,&mdash;tar water, or common cold water,&mdash;the patient always finds in&s;tant relief, and generally a perfect cure; while tho&s;e about him, or in the hou&s;e, are effectually &s;ecured from that dangerous malignancy which often &s;weeps off whole families into one common and untimely grave.</P>
<P>As the effects, or rather the medicines them&s;elves, fly in a mo|ment with the &s;wiftne&s;s of light from the &s;un&mdash;over the whole &s;y&s;tem, no other cordial whatever in nature has been found &s;o in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly and &s;o la&s;tingly to recruit the &s;trength and &s;pirits after great fatigue, or violent exertions of body or of mind, e&s;pe|cially in Venereal plea&s;ures.&mdash;They refre&s;h, brace, compo&s;e, com|fort, and literally &s;peaking, ILLUMINATE, all the bodily,&mdash;and thro' them&mdash;all the mental faculties; in &s;hort, in all &s;evere ill|ne&s;&s;es, in &s;inkings, and in faintings in con&s;equence of &s;evere ex|cruciating pain, profu&s;e evacuations of blood, &amp;c. and draining weakne&s;&s;es of every kind, or from whatever cau&s;es proceeding, the&s;e medicines (e&s;pecially the nervous aetherial bal&s;am) are ALWAYS found to produce the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing good effects, which are manife&s;ted to the patient, and to every one pre&s;ent, even the fir&s;t minute they are u&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>II. NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM! OR, THE RESTORATIVE AETHERIAL OIL, FOR DECAYED AND WORN OUT CONSTITUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IF the reader can conceive of the riche&s;t&mdash;pure&s;t&mdash;and mo&s;t &s;trengthening parts of all the cordial and nouri&s;hing things he is acquainted with in nature&mdash;being extracted, purified, exalted, harmonized and concentrated into a &s;mall compa&s;s,&mdash;he may al&s;o conceive of the nature and properties of this precious bal&s;am.</P>
<P>The Peruvian bark, cinnamon, &s;affron, ca&s;tor, lavender, &s;age, ro&s;e|mary, red-ro&s;e-buds, electrical nitre, ambergri&s;e, myrrh, amber, and benjamin;&mdash;the bal&s;ams of Tolu and Gilead,&mdash;and various other bal|my bracers, and fragrant aromatic &s;trengtheners are &s;elected with my own hand, and prepared under my own eye: a pure aetherial e&s;|&s;ence, combined with a certain portion of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t ge|nuine wine, is then poured upon the ingredients, and being pro|perly mixed and &s;ecured, they are placed to macerate and dige&s;t, like the electrical aether, under the united influences of dephlogi&s;ti|cated or vivifying air, aether, magneti&s;m and electricity, in the great globes which compo&s;e the tremendous pyramids on the domes of the Temples.</P>
<P>From the pre&s;ent general &s;tile of living&mdash;from the luxury, folly, di&s;&s;ipation, and enervating indulgences of per&s;ons, perhaps of every rank, the di&s;orders which now a days prevail, and which hara&s;s and wear out human life, are &s;uch as proceed either from conden&s;ed fluids, morbid humours, and heterogeneous vi&s;cidities in the blood or lymph;&mdash;or, from irritation, relaxation and debility of the &s;o|lids and nervous &s;y&s;tem. The former however complicated,&mdash;how|ever various in their appearances, are very ju&s;tly attributed to vene|real, &s;corbutic, gouty, or &s;crophulous humours&mdash;and the latter are promi&s;cuou&s;ly and not improperly termed nervous; they ari&s;e chiefly from tepid &s;oft luxurious and artificial living, enervating indulgen|cies, I mean in venereal plea&s;ures, and from drinking daily that agonizing yet bewitching poi&s;on, foreign tea; and are often &s;o di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing and oppre&s;&s;ive to the mi&s;erable patient,&mdash;as to make riches and honours, and even life it&s;elf a burthen&mdash;a weary and heavy bur|then, which they would gladly,&mdash;nay even &s;ometimes&mdash;impiou&s;ly and fatally venture to lay down.</P>
<P>In the former ca&s;es, namely, in vi&s;cidities and impurities of the blood and juices, from &s;corbutic, venereal, gouty and rheumatic humours, the Imperial Pills, by and by to be de&s;cribed, will be found in general the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t certain antidote: and in the latter, viz. in all nervous, putrid and debilitated habits, this nervous
<PB N="8" REF="8">atherial bal&s;am is without exception the milde&s;t and mo&s;t effectual remedy that can be met with in the whole circle of nature!&mdash;for in all nervous complaints and weakne&s;&s;es;&mdash;in all convul&s;ions, epi|leptic, apoplectic and hy&s;teric fits, in all ob&s;tructions and irregula|rities in the monthly periods of women, particularly at the two cri|tical and mo&s;t dangerous periods of commencement and final ce&s;|&s;ation, this Bal&s;am, the Electrical Aether, or the Imperial Pills, are ab&s;olutely infallable in producing the happie&s;t effects. For I will venture to &s;ay, that there is &s;carce a men&s;trual ob&s;truction in the world&mdash;however complicated, or however confirmed, but what will be overcome and effectually removed by taking three tea &s;poonfuls of the <HI>electrical aether</HI> and as much of the Nerv. Aeth. Bal&s;am, mixed both together in a pint of cold water for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mornings, if the patient is plump and &s;anguine; but if on the contrary, &s;he is lean, cold and languid, &s;he mu&s;t take three tea &s;poonfuls <HI>of the</HI> NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM, and the like quantity of the Electrical Aether, thrice every day in wine, &s;pirits, or herb tea, and continue it for only three days. In both ca&s;es, and under the&s;e oppo&s;ite cir|cum&s;tances, with due attention to the above di&s;tinctions, a perfect cure will undoubtedly take place; e&s;pecially if plenty of the me|dicines be rubbed on the loins and back bone, and in the former ca&s;e the application of cold water is made to THE PARTS, hands and feet, for hours daily,&mdash;and in the latter ca&s;e warm wine or &s;pirits and water&mdash;be applied daily in like manner.&mdash;In both, and in every ca&s;e, running about in the open air is earne&s;tly recom|mended.&mdash;But when the patient is too much weakened and re|duced from the <HI>oppo&s;ite cau&s;es,</HI>&mdash;namely, too long&mdash;too copious and profu&s;e a flow,&mdash;and great palene&s;s and debility brought on; &mdash;REST, <HI>cool air,</HI>&mdash;the application to the parts, and indeed to every part of the body and limbs, of cold milk and water, or red wine, and a cour&s;e of the nervous aetherial bal&s;am, with an infu&s;ion or tea of the Peruvian bark, red ro&s;e leaves, and a little nitre, with Bri&s;tol or Spa water &mdash;will build her up into a rock of &s;nowy alaba&s;ter, &s;tudded with ro&s;es and &s;treaked with cele&s;tial blue, removing the cau&s;es of &s;te|rility, or barrenne&s;s,&mdash;making her a lovely and de&s;irable compa|nion! &mdash;a healthy and a happy mother!&mdash;But for farther particulars relative to the&s;e delicate and important matters, &s;ee my "Private Medical Advice to Married Ladies and Gentlemen; to tho&s;e e&s;pecially who are not ble&s;&s;ed with children"&mdash;with full directions for preven|tion, or for &s;peedy and perfect recovery after mi&s;carriages and dan|gerous lyings-in.

<P>N. B. In the above, &s;uch &s;imple, natural, and effectual means for removing the cau&s;es of barrenne&s;s in both &s;exes as never were recommended, or even thought of before, in any age or nation,
<PB N="9" REF="9">&mdash;are pointed out;&mdash;and &s;uch directions given, as will, if duly at|tended to, make man and wife &s;weeter&mdash;lovelier&mdash;more amiable, &mdash;and more DESIREABLE in the eyes of one another.</P>
<P>After what has been already &s;aid, I need &s;carcely add, that in all &s;carlet, miliary, jail, bilious, nervous, putrid, &s;potted and ma+lignant fevers&mdash;e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, Ame|rica, &amp;c. the&s;e medicines are ab&s;olute and &s;peedy &s;pecifics. A per&s;on armed and provided with the&s;e, and with the genuine powder of Dr. James, need not fear any inflammatory fever, or any low, putrid, malignant, or bi&s;ious fever or complaint whatever; in any climate, &s;ea&s;on, or in any part of the terraqueous globe. The&s;e will be a mo&s;t complete apothecary's &s;hop, and nature, common &s;en&s;e, and the patient's own feelings&mdash;a <HI>trio</HI> of the &s;afe&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e, therefore, where the patient is low, faint, feeble or emaciated, from &s;corbutic or venereal virus, a &s;harp poverty&mdash; or putrid di&s;&s;olution of the blood and juices;&mdash;or from want of a due ela&s;tic tone of the &s;olids&mdash;ari&s;ing from a deficiency of the vital &s;pi|rits&mdash;or of the balmy nervous fluid, this nervous aetherial bal&s;am! has not its equal in nature;&mdash;and this I aver CONFIDENTLY, from very much, and very happy experience in actual practice, which in all things is the only infallible guide&mdash;the only incontrovertible evi|dence! Thou&s;ands by it alone, have been &s;natched from the grave: and &s;till many more thou&s;ands of the human &s;pecies when languid and worn out with di&s;ea&s;es, exce&s;&s;es, irregularities, enormities and early imprudencies, have been &s;uddenly built up into firm rocks of blooming health, and intellectual happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this &s;hort account of this great medicine, by ob&s;erving, that in all le&s;&s;er nervous complaints and unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, occa&s;ioned by tea, coffee, adulterated wine, or pernicious liquors; and in all tho&s;e little lingering fevers, heats and chilline&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e tremors and quiverings of body, and re&s;tle&s;s anxieties, dread, horrors, di&s;content and un&s;ettledne&s;&s;es of mind, which proceed merely from an irregular circulation of the blood, or from &s;pa&s;ms, debility, or relaxation of the nervous &s;y&s;tem,&mdash;this aetherial bal&s;am will always be found of immediate &s;ervice, and by a gentle&mdash; per&s;evering cour&s;e of it, and of the Imperial Pills, duly attending to the directions given with them, a perfect and a la&s;ting cure will in general be obtained. Becau&s;e by them the blood and juices are purified, &s;weetened, tempered, and brought to a pure fluid &s;tate, while the &s;olids are braced and &s;trengthened, and the nerves &s;heathed, nouri&s;hed, &s;teadied and coiled up.</P>
<P>Many fanciful, rich, and luxurious people, who are in fact in good health, and who ought by no means to take this precious aetherial bal&s;am, or any other medicine, neverthele&s;s accu&s;tom
<PB N="10" REF="10">them&s;elves to take more or le&s;s of it, and even an imperial pill or two every day;&mdash;with &s;uch people, or when at any time they are taken into a &s;ound and tranquil body, they produce no other operation or &s;en&s;ation, than a more genial and bri&s;ker flow of the blood and animal &s;pirits,&mdash;and that &s;pecies of contentment, thankfulne&s;s, and benevo|lent gladne&s;s of heart, which makes us happy in our&s;elves, and agree|able to all about us: but where they meet with di&s;ea&s;es and corruption, they encounter them with the boldne&s;s and maje&s;ty of a lion, effec|thally expelling them, and leaving a clean and a quiet hou&s;e for health and happine&s;s to re&s;ide in.</P>
<P>The nervous aetherial bal&s;am, then, is by very far, and without exception, the mo&s;t exhilerating, anti&s;pa&s;modic, bracing, re&s;tora|tive, &s;trengthening, and con&s;equently anti&s;ceptic medicine in the world&mdash;infinitely &s;uperior to the common tinctures of the bark, va|lerian, ca&s;tor, &s;affron, lavender, &amp;c.&mdash;and infinitely more cordial and mild than the burning inflammatory &s;alts, and fiery fetid &s;pirits of hart&s;horn, eau de luce, &s;al volatile, and all the liqueurs, drams, and cordials, foreign and dome&s;tic, which only bewitch and give a temporary relief, which mu&s;t &s;oon give way to additional horror, darkne&s;s, dejection and de&s;pair.</P>

<HEAD>III. THE IMPERIAL PILLS. OR, THE UNIVERSAL PURIFIERS OF THE BLOOD AND JUICES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS title was given to them to mark their exceeding &s;upe|riority over all the analeptic or &s;tomachic pills, anti&s;corbutis drops, and alterative purifying medicines that perhaps ever were in|vented, or which are now u&s;ed in the world.&mdash;In all weakne&s;&s;es, op|pre&s;&s;ions, flatulencies, cholickly gripings, and windy di&s;ten&s;ions of the &s;tomach and bowels, e&s;pecially when tho&s;e unea&s;y, and indeed tormenting complaints proceed from &s;corbutic, venereal, gouty or bilious humours, freting, corroding, and irritating the nervous coats of the &s;tomach and bowels;&mdash;or from heats, acidities, crudities and indige&s;tions, occa&s;ioned by full and foul feeding; exce&s;&s;ive drinking of hot and foul wines and liquors; heats and colds, or &s;urfeits; ir|regular and late hours as to &s;leep; want of exerci&s;e, and per&s;piration, &amp;c. &amp;c,&mdash;in all &s;uch ca&s;es, the Imperial Pills are con&s;tantly found to give immediate relief, and if the per&s;on is prudent and temperate, by a regular and gentle per&s;everance in the u&s;e of them&mdash;a perfect and a la&s;ting cure will, with a moral certainty, be obtained.</P>
<P>The&s;e pills are a compo&s;ition of the pure&s;t parts of the choice&s;t ar|ticles of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> combined and rendered &s;till more

But as the <HI>perfecting</HI> all this va&s;t and mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem requires a degree of intelli|geuce far&mdash;very far &s;uperior to what I can pretend to, I tru&s;t that God will rai&s;e up a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men who will carry on and perfect what I have &s;o happily begun.
<P>In the mean time, I re&s;pectfully intreat the corre&s;pondence of all men of learn|ing, &s;cience, and ingenuity; mo&s;t earne&s;tly be&s;eeching every man and woman in the world, <HI>without exception,</HI> to communicate to me per&s;onally, by their friends, or by letter, any thing that they already know, or may hereafter di&s;cover, for the cure, alleviation, or prevention of any one di&s;ea&s;e; or for rendering human exi&s;tence longer or happier on this earth: and likewi&s;e whatever they now know, or may hereafter di&s;cover for the improvement or embelli&s;hment of religion, philo&s;ophy, or the u&s;eful arts; e&s;pecially in metals and minerals. I will be ex|tremely happy to be favoured with the opinions and conjectures of per&s;ons of in|genuity, of goodne&s;s of heart, or of excentric brilliant imaginations. And as this corre&s;pondence will co&s;t each of my friends individually, but a few pence for paying the po&s;tages of their letters, while otherwi&s;e the aggregate, centring in me, would co&s;t probably &s;everal hundred pounds annually; I hope therefore that my liberal, polite, and ingenious corre&s;pondents will continue to have the goodne&s;s to write to me, POST PAID.

<PB N="12" REF="12">metal dome of the Temple of Health, which globe alone, like each of the other three, contains thirty-&s;ix gallons, and is of the fine&s;t burni&s;hed gold.</P>
<P>The Imperial Pills are of &s;o mild and friendly a nature that they are found to agree perfectly well with both &s;exes and with every age and con&s;titution. They operate fir&s;t by di&s;&s;olving all tough, cold phlegm or &s;lime, and other gro&s;s, corrupted, bilious and putrid hu|mours, which not only clog and irritate the &s;tomach and bowels, but form a ne&s;t and nouri&s;hment for tho&s;e common and mo&s;t de&s;tructive vermin, WORMS&mdash;which they effectually kill, evacuate and carry off by &s;tool and urine: after that, by continuing their moderate u&s;e as an alterative, without change of diet, confinement, or any irk|&s;ome re&s;traint whatever, they &s;ubdue, eradicate, and expel by &s;tool, urine, and a breathing in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, all &s;corbutic, gouty, rheumatic, venereal, bilious and &s;crophulous humours, however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the &s;y&s;tem, preying on, and exhau&s;ting the &s;trength and &s;pirits, and undermining and de|&s;troying all the &s;prings and principles of life.</P>
<P>Rubbing and exerci&s;e are univer&s;ally allowed to be good for the re|covery as well as for the pre&s;ervation of health. Now the&s;e act by exciting the electrical fire in the body which removes ob&s;tructions, animates and braces. The Imperial Pills therefore, and the Aetherial Bal&s;am, being filled with the electrical or cele&s;tial fire, and &s;olar light, which the balmy re&s;ins of which they are compo&s;ed have im|bibed and do retain, promote all the natural and nece&s;&s;ary circula|tions, &s;ecretions and ab&s;orptions, and con&s;equently <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to tho&s;e per&s;ons, e&s;pecially to females, who take too little free air and exerci&s;e, tho' at the &s;ame time they live full, and are of a co&s;tive or irregular habit. Upon the &s;ame grounds they are found exceedingly beneficial in tho&s;e heats, &s;pa&s;ms, pains, and unea&s;ine&s;&s;es in females, occa&s;ioned by the <HI>periodical</HI> fulne&s;s of their ve&s;&s;els, and <HI>from certain other cau&s;es:</HI> but the good effects in gouty, &s;corbutic, and rheumatic ca&s;es, and in all eruptions, or pimples of the face,&mdash;&s;ores or blotches, of the body and limbs, however invete rately blended in the blood,&mdash;however ob&s;tinately confirmed in the con&s;titution&mdash;are really a&s;toni&s;hing. The dreadful train of &s;ufferings which the mi&s;erable patients in the above ca&s;es endure, and even the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate rheumatic &s;wellings and weakne&s;&s;es of the joints, &amp;c. yield very readily to the &s;uperior efficacy of the&s;e excellent pills;&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="13">and they are a diuretic of &s;o &s;oft yet &s;earching a nature, that they generally give very &s;peedy ea&s;e in &s;evere fits of the &s;tone and gravel, and by per&s;evering in a proper cour&s;e of them, and of my Nervous Aetherial Bal&s;am at the &s;ame time, and drinking veal broth with plenty of gum arabic di&s;&s;olved in it, or of a decoction of liquorice, lin&s;eed, and mar&s;hmallow roots poured upon &s;hred leeks, and brui&s;ed fennil &s;eeds with &s;ome honey or treacle, they often have been found to cure radically tho&s;e mo&s;t painful and mo&s;t excruciating di&s;orders.</P>
<P>But in all le&s;s grievous, tho' abundantly trouble&s;ome complaints of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;they are an ab&s;olute &s;pecific. For they imme|diately re&s;tore lo&s;t appetite, and correct all hot, acrid, and four fer|mentations in the &s;tomach and bowels, which they &s;o genially cool and invigotate, as to enable them to concoct and extract tho&s;e fine mild nutritious juices of our food and drink, which nouri&s;h the body and gladden the &s;oul. By the&s;e means the breath is rendered balmy and &s;weet; the face is cleared from &s;curf, heat and pimples, prema|ture wrinkles are &s;moothed away and obliterated, and the com|plexion rendered clear, &s;mooth fre&s;h and youthful; and all the&s;e happy effects are produced in&s;en&s;ibly as it were, without (as I &s;aid before) confinement, particular regimen in food or drink, or hindrance of bu&s;ine&s;s; their operation, like the Nervous Aetherial Bal&s;am, being &s;o mild and congenial to human nature, that they may be taken under any circum&s;tance, in any climate, or at any &s;ea&s;on of the year, tho' when taken merely as a pre&s;erver of health, the &s;pring and autumn &s;ea&s;ons are doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>The Imperial Pills therefore, while they fortify the &s;tomach and bowels, and purge the blood and lymph from all morbid humours, and <HI>heterogeneous</HI> &s;harpne&s;&s;es and vi&s;cidities, they &s;o perfectly eradicate all venereal and &s;corbutic di&s;ea&s;es, that I defy the world to bring me any &s;uch ca&s;e if <HI>at all curabl,</HI> but what I will radically, &s;peedily and &s;afely cure by a proper cour&s;e fir&s;t of the&s;e pills, and afterwards of my Aetherial Bal&s;am, without the u&s;e of one grain of that horrible poi&s;on, mercury. Indeed <HI>than</HI> the&s;e medicines, and my Electrical Sul|phur, there has been no others as yet di&s;covered, whatever quacks and empyries may pretend, which &s;o &s;peedily and &s;o completely counteract the deadly effects of mercury, and other violent medicines, which of|ten &s;o tear, &s;hake, and debilitate the con&s;titution as to make the dear bought cure of the primary complaint, no great ble&s;&s;ing to the feeble <HI>unnerved</HI> patient. This &s;ingular and mo&s;t invaluable quality of the Imperial Pills is ocularly demon&s;trated to the patient and to all his friends, by almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;topping the highe&s;t &s;alivation, throwing off the pocky or &s;corbutic virus, &amp;c. by &s;tool, by urine, and by &s;weat: and by making the quick&s;ilver run off in globules by &s;tool in quan|tities nearly proportioned to tho&s;e that had been unfortunately u&s;ed. Now the univer&s;ally <HI>allowed,</HI> and <HI>two well known</HI> effects of mercury are to di&s;&s;olve and break down the ma&s;s of blood into a &s;harp, watery
<PB N="14" REF="14">putrid gore;&mdash;and to tear, deaden, relax, and render tremulous the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem; but the Imperial Pills carry the mercury and all venereal and &s;corbutic humours entirely out of the body, re&s;toring the healthy tone of the &s;tomach, bowels, and &s;olids in general;&mdash;and the nervous aetherial bal&s;am very &s;peedily warms, and &s;teadies the cold&mdash;quivering&mdash;tottering body; re&s;toring the balmy cra&s;is of the blood and juices; &s;heathing, bracing, and invigorating the dry, &s;hrunk and tremulous nerves; and ab&s;olutely cures all &s;eminal weak|ne&s;&s;es and debility in both &s;exes, from whatever cau&s;es proceeding, but tho&s;e e&s;pecially which ari&s;e from ill cured, neglected, improperly treated or repeated venereal complaints, early imprudencies, irre|gularities, and all unnatural and inordinate exertions and indulgen|cies e&s;pecially in the &s;acrifices that are made to Venus, or to Bac|chus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the peculiar and mo&s;t important properties of my Nervous Aetherial Bal&s;am is to recover and produce that genial vital warmth, which is &s;o different from an inflaming feveri&s;h heat.</NOTE>. Let the inventors or proprietors of other medicines which are &s;ent abroad into the world, make a parade of their PATENTS, &amp;c.&mdash;For the&s;e great medicines I never thought of &s;uch &s;ecurities or &s;anc|tions. No. I am not afraid of any one counterfeiting <HI>them,</HI> tho' I find it has been vainly and ridiculou&s;ly attempted. The compo&s;itions are &s;o curious and complex, and the ingredients &s;o very &s;ubtil, that they will not bear to be analyzed by even the mo&s;t &s;kilful adept in philo&s;ophical or pharmaceutical chemi&s;try. I repeat it. The in|gredients are too co&s;tly and too numerous,&mdash;the proce&s;&s;es too com|plex and tedious,&mdash;and the apparatus employed in the preparation of them co&s;ts too many thou&s;and pounds for mo&s;t adventurers, even of abilities, in the medical or medicinal line to engage with or even to think of. They are now, I find, bought by &s;ome of the mo&s;t emi|nent of the faculty, in various parts of the world as well as in the&s;e kingdoms, and exhibited in &s;evere dangerous and important ca&s;es &s;ometimes as their own preparations: and I a&s;&s;ure the nobility, gentry, and even the faculty who are de&s;irous of knowing every ingre|dient in the compo&s;ition of each, or of either of the three medicines, that they need only apply to me to be fully &s;atisfied in every particular which they feel them&s;elves intere&s;ted in. To know them is to approve of them; and to u&s;e them once, is to u&s;e and recommend them mo&s;t cordially for ever. Such is their intrin&s;ic excellency that they will bear every te&s;t&mdash;even the te&s;t&mdash;the criterion&mdash;the fiery ordeal of ex|perience in the mo&s;t confirmed, and mo&s;t hopele&s;s ca&s;es:&mdash;for they have been brought to their pre&s;ent high &s;tate of perfection by long and deliberate inve&s;tigations of the real qualities of medicines, by the deepe&s;t re&s;earches into chemi&s;try, enlightened by the important di&s;|coveries and improvements which have lately been made in natural philo&s;ophy; and finally, by the nice&s;t and mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention to the effects and operations of the medicines them&s;elves, in a mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="15" REF="15">cour&s;e of private practice in this, as well as in various foreign countries; and the invariable re&s;ult of their judicious u&s;e has been effec|tually, to prevent, and with certainty to cure mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es to which mankind is obnoxious,&mdash;but e&s;pecially tho&s;e which the natives of the&s;e i&s;lands are liable to at &s;ea or in foreign countries&mdash;in&s;omuch that many gentlemen, e&s;pecially of the army and navy would now almo&s;t as &s;oon go to &s;ea without provi&s;ions, or upon along journey without money as without a certain &s;tock of the&s;e three precious remedies. Indeed, in the hands of people of prudence and good &s;en&s;e, they &s;uper&s;ede the need of a travelling phy&s;ician, or of any medicine che&s;t&mdash;for they are of them&s;elves an apothecary's &s;hop fully adequate to the preven|tion and cure of mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es. And &s;o thoroughly convinced am I of the univer&s;al &s;alutarine&s;s, and &s;uperior efficacy of the&s;e three great medicines, that in a VERY few years I will probably relinqui&s;h the practical part of medicine altogether, but continue to di&s;pen&s;e the&s;e medicines all over the world, WHILE, for the good of the human &s;pecies of every nation and clime,&mdash;even for the children of tho&s;e who &s;hall be born a thou&s;and years hence, I will publickly teach medicine and philo&s;ophy in academical lectures, and from time to time publi&s;h what I am now compiling, viz. a complete Sy&s;tem of Prophylactic and Practical Medicine; or, the whole art (without even a &s;hadow of re&s;erve) of preventing and curing di&s;ea&s;es. Per|haps, likewi&s;e, I may &s;end into the world, a complete and rational Body of Divinity, or true vital religion, which I am now likewi&s;e preparing; and perhaps, moreover a manual of Human Prudence;&mdash;or a &s;afe and complete guide of life: and a SIMPLE, yet full and na|turally dige&s;ted code of laws for civil, political, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government,&mdash;&s;ubmitted with great deference to tho&s;e, to whom they more immediately, and more properly belong. But to return, I was ob&s;erving the efficacy of THE THREE GREAT MEDICINES in re|&s;toring decayed, con&s;umptive, and worn-out con&s;titutions, or after &s;evere di&s;ea&s;es, har&s;h and improper medicines, or hard&s;hips and &s;ick|ne&s;s in foreign hot climates. Upon this &s;ubject I can &s;carce &s;ay enough. Yet to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the medicines everything which even I <HI>could</HI> &s;ay, would be quite unnece&s;&s;ary. What need is there to expatiate on the genial qualities of the &s;un, which are univer&s;ally felt, and univer&s;ally acknowledged?&mdash;I will only ob&s;erve for the in|formation of the world in general, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es, they moi&s;ten, warm, refre&s;h and build up the whole &s;y&s;tem, with bland, mild, balmy and nutritious juices; and by inducing a free, re|gular, &s;teady and genial circulation of the blood <HI>(which is the true radical moi&s;ture)</HI> &s;pirits, and nervous fluid, or that aetherial invi&s;ible principle which actuates the nerves, and which altogether con&s;titute the balmy life of the body; and, finally, by inducing the due and re|ciprocal action of the &s;olids and fluids on each other; or in other words, that happy <HI>equilibrium</HI>&mdash;that peaceful balance! which nature
<PB N="16" REF="16">delights in, and con&s;tantly endeavours to maintain in the whole vi|&s;ible as well as invi&s;ible creation&mdash;they produce in the human body that peaceful, homogene, tranquil &s;tate which we call health, and which is doubtle&s;s the natural and original &s;tate of all created things: for pain, di&s;cord and di&s;ea&s;e, are &s;o very unnatural, that even pain and di&s;ea&s;e are only a departure from, and imply a po&s;&s;ibility of health,&mdash;or the attainment of that &s;tate which nature pants after, and which man originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. All di&s;tempers are in fact but a &s;truggle between the <HI>vis vitae</HI> and the peculiar Mia&s;ma, or <HI>Fomes Mer|bi.</HI> Indeed every &s;pecies and degree of plea&s;ure, and of bodily and mental happine&s;s which we enjoy in this world, are only the irradia|tions or emanations of this primary principle, namely, concord or health. This is the GREAT UNITY!&mdash;the root and branches&mdash;the flowers and the fruits&mdash;the &s;ap and the life of mankind; To contrive and adapt, from the harmonious combination of the four elements acting on natural &s;ub&s;tances of KNOWN EFFICACY, &s;uch medicines as could root out di&s;ea&s;e, di&s;cord and &s;trife from the human body, and produce, cultivate and nouri&s;h this heavenly unity, hath been my con&s;tant &s;tudy, I may &s;ay, day and night for many years. How far I have &s;ucceeded has been long and abundantly obvious, not only from the prodigious and unprecedented &s;ale of the&s;e Great Medi|cines; but from the a&s;toni&s;hing and well known numbers which are daily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Temple of Health perfectly cured of di&s;|ea&s;es which had baffled all other human means. Now this unity or health,&mdash;this SELF-REMEDY in nature for all her di&s;orders, was the &s;eal with which God impre&s;&s;ed every thing at the creation. And it was THIS in man which was emphatically called, "the IMAGE OF GOD."&mdash;This was paradi&s;e for man! This was the paradi&s;e of the earth, and of all the elements.&mdash;But man departing from God, and from the innocence and &s;implicity in which he was created, brought di&s;cord and di&s;ea&s;es into his &s;oul and body;&mdash;from hence proceeds his &s;hort and uncertain exi&s;tence in this world; hence flow pain, di&s;ea&s;e and death;&mdash;and from hence, too, perhaps all evil and com|motions within and without, in the natural and in the moral world. All fevers, fermentations, jarrings, re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, commotions, pains and di&s;ea&s;es in the human body, are, therefore proofs of that hid|den&mdash;con&s;titutional peace and health which it has lo&s;t, and nece&s;&s;a|rily gravitates unto, and endeavours to regain, altho' it knows not the way&mdash;nor is it always &s;o happy as to meet with, or follow, a friendly and unerring guide.</P>
<P>That the above medicines, conjunctly, are &s;uch a friend&mdash;&s;uch a guide! no one will doubt who has attended properly to the plain, open and &s;imple de&s;cription which I have given of them; nor will any one deny the truth of the fact, who has fairly and prudently u&s;ed them&mdash;even in the mo&s;t de&s;perate ca&s;es. The&s;e great medicines then, will re&s;tore health and tranquility&mdash;becau&s;e they re&s;tore in our
<PB N="17" REF="17">body, as I have above &s;hewn, that original unity,&mdash;balance&mdash;har|mony or <HI>equilibrium</HI> which nature delights in, and continually &s;trives to maintain in all her works&mdash;e&s;pecially in the human body and mind, as being the mo&s;t perfect and important of all that &s;he has created, or placed on this terraqueous globe!</P>
<P>The&s;e, therefore, conjunctly, may ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed the true and genuine UNIVERSAL MEDICINE!&mdash;the boa&s;ted and long wi&s;hed for <HI>Pri|ma Materia!&mdash;Aurum potabile!</HI> or <HI>elixir vitae!</HI> of the philo&s;ophers, che|mi&s;ts, and phy&s;icians of every age &s;ince medicine became a &s;cience.&mdash;In the&s;e three medicines, by the wonderful influence of the mighty&mdash;primary&mdash;&s;imple agents upon each other, and upon the &s;imple &s;ub|&s;tances above mentioned, which for &s;o many ages have been found &s;o friendly to man&mdash;is produced and fixed,&mdash;a vivifying&mdash;homogene principle which counteracts di&s;ea&s;e, in&s;ures health, and the prolonga|tion of our mortal exi&s;tence. In the balmy bed of the&s;e three medi|cines, all elementary and inte&s;tine &s;trife cea&s;es. Here, the active&mdash;the irre&s;i&s;tible powers of air, earth, fire and water blend their &s;eem|ingly jarring principles, and are at peace. Here wih the &s;wiftne&s;s of thought, they meet in one common centre. They ki&s;s each other as it were,&mdash;cordially embrace, and are at re&s;t in this paradi&s;iacal&mdash;this balmy bed. For be it known (and however paradoxical it may appear, it is neverthele&s;s a certain&mdash;&s;ublime, and philo&s;ophical truth) that the quicke&s;t motion, is the mo&s;t perfect re&s;t. When a boy whips his top into the bri&s;ke&s;t motion&mdash;it turns about with &s;uch exceeding &s;wiftne&s;s that it appears perfectly motionle&s;s&mdash;and he &s;ays it is a&s;leep. Would not any thing that could pa&s;s from this to the Ea&s;t Indies and back again in the thou&s;andth part of a moment&mdash;be at perfect re&s;t?&mdash;could a thought&mdash;or any thing that could glance or be &s;hot from your eye in London to the farthe&s;t verge&mdash;to the mo&s;t di&s;tant point of the globe and back again in the millionth part of the time of a twinkle in your eye,&mdash;could it be &s;aid to move at all?&mdash;Surely not.&mdash;When the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e therefore is expelled by the&s;e great medicines they INSTANTLY compo&s;e all &s;trife. I NEVER &s;wallow any wine, &s;pirits, or malt liquor, &s;trong or weak, mixt nor unmixt, and yet I undergo daily with plea&s;ure, cheerfulne&s;s and good health, more fatigue of body and of mind, than perhaps any other man in London;&mdash;If, after the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, or when I am forced to be up all night when &s;ent for in great emergencies&mdash;I find my&s;elf faint and exhau&s;ted,&mdash;I immediately draw the vapour of the electri|cal aether with great force into my no&s;trils&mdash;or pour a few tea|&s;poonfuls of it into a ba&s;on of warm water and breathe over it;&mdash;and ordering a few new laid eggs to be beat as it were into a thin oil, and then mixed with &s;ome &s;ugar and <HI>very</HI> COLD water, I drink it off, and eating a bit of bi&s;cuit, rich ripe fruits, or dry bread two days old, I find my&s;elf, in a few minutes, perfectly fre&s;h and re|cruited.
<PB N="18" REF="18">But what always a&s;toni&s;hes me above mea&s;ure is, the &s;eem|ingly miraculous effect of my Electrical Aether, or NERVOUS AETHE|RIAL BALSAM, of which, when I take a tea-&s;poonful or two into my mouth upon a bit of &s;ugar, I feel my body refre&s;hed, braced, and &s;trengthened, and my mind enlarged and illuminated, in one moment. It darts its genial aetherial &s;oul with the &s;wiftne&s;s of light&mdash;or with the inconceivable &s;wiftne&s;s above mentioned, through every nerve&mdash;vein&mdash;artery!

<P>The&s;e wonderful and mo&s;t genial medicines attune the body, and thro' it the mind;&mdash;or, rather, the mind and the body freed from di&s;cord and di&s;ea&s;e, recover, by their own energy, their natural and original healthy tone and brilliancy:&mdash;And this happy &s;tate at|tained&mdash;every thing which &s;urrounds us appears likewi&s;e plea&s;ant, gay and harmonious. Like, as in mu&s;ical in&s;truments tuned in uni|&s;on, every chord which is touched, &s;trikes and calls forth, by its own vibratory force alone, a corre&s;ponding mu&s;ical tone from every octave in the other in&s;truments in the &s;ame room, thus invi&s;ibly touched. The&s;e are facts perfectly well known to philo&s;ophers, and to tho&s;e who have &s;tudied mu&s;ic as a &s;cience. But to return; I &s;ay, that upon the grounds of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, it is no wonder that the&s;e medi|cines, when judiciou&s;ly applied, are &s;o efficacious as to remove all di&s;|orders that ari&s;e from the jarrings and di&s;proportions of the con&s;tituent parts or qualities in human bodies&mdash;becau&s;e the&s;e medicines are a|dapted, and accommodate them&s;elves to all, and health en&s;ues in the mo&s;t ea&s;y, &s;imple, and natural manner. The wi&s;e and &s;acred writer &s;ays, "That God hath created medicines out of the earth, and that he who is wi&s;e will not de&s;pi&s;e them."&mdash;Now as the qualities or virtues of all roots, leaves, flowers, fruits and &s;eeds,&mdash;and of every medi|cinal &s;ub&s;tance in nature, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, mu&s;t undoubtedly re&s;ide in &s;ome little drops&mdash;&s;ome exqui&s;itely &s;mall particles of ONE <HI>prima materia!</HI> which is the fountain or centre of exi&s;tence, life and health&mdash;and as this fountain&mdash;or &s;ource&mdash;or
<PB N="19" REF="19">centre, is to be found alone by the gift of God; or, in other words, by his ble&s;&s;ing on the reverential and a&s;&s;iduous labours and inve&s;tiga|tions of tho&s;e who &s;earch unweariedly into the va&s;t trea&s;ures of na|ture, with a view of promoting the good and happine&s;s of the world, and the honour and glory of God!&mdash;Whenever therefore, we can extract and concentrate from the adventitious, gro&s;s, or inactive parts&mdash;the balmy, &s;imple, homogeneous and vivi&s;ying particles of &s;ub&s;tances truly medicinal, by means of the harmonious combination of the great univer&s;al principles of air, aether, magneti&s;m, electricity, and &s;olar light, we need look for no other medicines; and I defy any phy&s;ician to mention an indication in the cure of any di&s;ea&s;e, whether by altering, attenuating, opening, purifying, &s;weating, purging, vo|miting, pa&s;&s;ing off by the kidnies; or by taking off &s;pa&s;ms and irri|tations&mdash;by bracing and comforting the nerves,&mdash;or by &s;trength|ening and vivifying the whole &s;y&s;tem, but may be an&s;wered in the complete&s;t and mo&s;t friendly manner, by the judicious modulations and exhibitions of the&s;e three great medicines. They will therefore, upon principles perfectly demon&s;trable, cure all curable di&s;ea&s;es, gladden the heart, illuminate the mind, and prolong human exi&s;t|ence to the longe&s;t po&s;&s;ible period. Becau&s;e this exact mixture of hot and cold, moi&s;t and dry,&mdash;this harmonious tempering of the primary vital elements, coale&s;cing like chords in mu&s;ic, mu&s;t be peace makers in the &s;trife or di&s;orders of the con&s;tituent parts and qualities of man's body;&mdash;and becau&s;e the true quinte&s;&s;ence of na|ture is Fire. I don't mean the gro&s;s, impure, con&s;uming, culinary fire which we have every day before us in the world: by no means. The fire which I employ in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, and in the preparation of tho&s;e three great medicines, is the true elementary fire, which has been wor&s;hipped as it were by the philo&s;ophers of all ages. They <HI>had</HI> glimp&s;es of it; and even its dawn gleaming on their horizon filled them with ideas &s;o va&s;t and &s;ublime! that the herd of the world called them mad enthu&s;ia&s;ts. How much greater felicity mu&s;t <HI>we</HI> enjoy, upon whom the &s;un of &s;cience &s;hines &s;o bright as at this day. How much more may <HI>we</HI> benefit and enlighten the human &s;pecies! But &s;till, the &s;un ju&s;t alluded to, is far&mdash;very&mdash;very far from having at|tained its meridian altitude It even now points, but at &s;ix o'clock of a &s;ummer morning. Yet how fa&s;t&mdash;how &s;weetly&mdash;do the buds of every branch of &s;cience open!&mdash;The birds &s;ing&mdash;ALL NATURE RE|JOICES! But tho&s;e charming fields&mdash;the&s;e delightful pro&s;pects tempt me to wander too far. I will return. The fire I &s;ay which I employ in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, and for the preparation of the&s;e great medi|cines, is the univer&s;al living fire which connects and moves the whole &s;olar &s;y&s;tem&mdash;which animates all nature, and which you, my cour|teous

This fire is the breath of life&mdash;the &s;pi|rit of God!&mdash;which he breathed at the creation into man's no&s;trils, and which gives and maintains life throughout all his other works!&mdash;IT IS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF GENERATION! the fire which quickens the embryo in the womb!&mdash;even the pure fluid, cele&s;tial, electri|cal fire which pervades, purges, and animates ALL NATURE! con|&s;uming di&s;ea&s;e and corruption&mdash;attracting and uniting the four ele|ments&mdash;without de&s;troying their variety or di&s;tinct powers,&mdash;becau&s;e it is it&s;elf a compo&s;ition of them all&mdash;the joy of them all&mdash;and in a word the great band or material &s;oul of the univer&s;e!</P>
<P>THIS, <HI>then,</HI> is the natural&mdash;the cele&s;tial quinte&s;&s;ence or in&s;tuence with which tho&s;e three great medicines are impregnated&mdash;and with which they are replete:&mdash;even with the harmonious combination of the four elementary qualities in ONE;&mdash;and whenever this pure and &s;imple light, or concord is received into the body&mdash;di&s;ea&s;e and di&s;|cord <HI>mu&s;t</HI> vani&s;h, as the cold and darkne&s;s of the night mu&s;t vani&s;h at the pre&s;ence of the morning&mdash;of the &s;ummer's &s;un!&mdash;and I will now conclude this &s;hort and very imperfect account of my great medicines with a&s;&s;uring tho&s;e &s;ick and infirm per&s;ons who have not yet had the happine&s;s to partake of their &s;alutary influences,&mdash;that they are in their nature and operations, ea&s;y and benign,&mdash;genial and gentle as a dove&mdash;&s;trengthening and exhilirating the &s;oul and body of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who <HI>will</HI> have the &s;oul to be IMMATERIAL; will be perhaps highly offended at my bringing it in upon every occa&s;ion, head and &s;houlders with the body.

We all know that light, though &s;upremely pure, and infinitely &s;ubtil&mdash;is neverthe|le&s;s material: and I agree &s;o far with the generality of the world, as to con&s;ider the human &s;oul as a &s;ub&s;tance (or emanation in con&s;equence of the exqui&s;ite or|ganization of our body)&mdash;&s;o exqui&s;itely&mdash;&s;o &s;upremely pure and &s;ubtilias to be ab&s;olutely invi&s;ible and inconceivable to any or all of our &s;en&s;es.

Thus I have in three words, written all that I ever intend to write upon this &s;ubject.</NOTE> tho&s;e to whom they are thankfully and prudently admini&s;tered:&mdash;whil&s;t at the &s;ame time they are as &s;trong and as furious as lions in &s;ubduing and evacuating di&s;ea&s;es, and every thing
<PB N="21" REF="21">that is injurious or unfriendly to good health, or to human exi&s;tence. But the &s;trength above alluded to, is the &s;trength of a protector&mdash;and the fury, that of love!&mdash;becau&s;e they hurt not the weake&s;t or mo&s;t delicate, in infancy or in old age:&mdash;to the former they are as milk and honey&mdash;to the latter, as generous wine, or the &s;moothe&s;t&mdash;the &s;weete&s;t oil!&mdash;and to pur&s;ue the metaphor, they are in the la&s;t &s;tages, of mo&s;t &s;evere and fatal di&s;ea&s;es, what fre&s;h oil is to an ex|piring lamp&mdash;when the flame is, like a &s;ickly &s;hadow quivering and ga&s;ping in the dry &s;ocket.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR USING MY THREE GREAT MEDICINES.</HEAD>
<P>THE principles or con&s;tituent parts of the&s;e Medicines being &s;i|milar&mdash;they are found to produce the be&s;t effects and the greate&s;t and mo&s;t extraordinary cures, when taken together, or a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by each other. But in all ca&s;es whatever, I de&s;ire that tho&s;e who take them, do not regard <HI>my</HI> directions, &s;o much as the effects of the medicines,&mdash;their own feelings; and their own prudence and good &s;en&s;e. In <HI>acute</HI> ca&s;es they can &s;carcely be u&s;ed too plentifully; but in dangerous and long confirmed <HI>chronic</HI> ca&s;es&mdash;they may be u&s;ed more &s;paringly, and continued longer. But, after a cour&s;e of &s;ix weeks, if a complete cure be not obtained, they &s;hould be di&s;con|tinued for three, &s;ix, or nine weeks, and then re&s;umed again as for|merly. In all ca&s;es and con&s;titutions, in all habits of body, at every period of life, and under perhaps every circum&s;tance, cool air, drinking cold water plentifully, and bathing the whole body, or at lea&s;t the private parts with tepid or icy cold water, agrees perfectly well, and produces the happie&s;t and mo&s;t Divine Effects.</P>
<P>Let, therefore, my innumerable Tribes of Patients, I mean all who are taking my medicines, be almo&s;t con&s;tantly bu&s;tling about in the cool open air, regardle&s;s of wind or rain; let them be daily, and very frequently applying cold water to their face, neck, bo&s;om, &s;tomach, private parts, and limbs; in &s;hort, the partial or univer&s;al application of cold water to the &s;urface of the body I earne&s;tly and mo&s;t cordially
<PB N="23" REF="23">recommend: but &s;till more earne&s;tly, and above all things do I exhort to moderation, &s;implicity and regularity in eating, drinking and &s;leep|ing, and in all plea&s;ureable indulgences; in tho&s;e e&s;pecially <HI>(venereal)</HI> which drain the blood of its mo&s;t precious bal&s;am, and the nerves of their vital &s;pirits; &s;apping the &s;ources of health, and totally incapaci|tating both &s;oul and body from the proper performance of their na|tural, nece&s;&s;ary, and more noble functions,&mdash;and from enjoying with a keen healthy reli&s;h, the balmy&mdash;the cele&s;tial plea&s;ures&mdash;which the all-wi&s;e and &s;upremely beneficent Author of our exi&s;tence hath annexed to our animal, as well as to our intellectual nature!</P>
<P>As to the ELECTRICAL AETHER, the manner of u&s;ing it has been already pretty well explained in the account which is given of its nature, preparation, and properties. In all ca&s;es of weakne&s;s, fainting, putrifaction and debility, e&s;pecially in a&s;thmas, con&s;ump|tions, and all painful ob&s;tructions of the head or brea&s;t, it may be &s;melled to for &s;everal minutes and very often. The vial &s;hould be held in a warm hand to the patient's no&s;tril, and the other &s;topped by pre&s;&s;ing it &s;ideways with the finger, while the cold vapour is drawn up with great force. It &s;hould not be taken away from the no&s;e notwith&s;tanding its &s;trength; for the longer the patient &s;mells at it, the better able he is, for his breath becomes longer, and he &s;eems to enter delighted into the flowery fields of Ely&s;ium!&mdash;Often, very often have I exhau&s;ted a whole bottle in one day, or evening, merely by &s;melling. A little of it may be poured into a pot or ba&s;on of warm or hot water, brandy and water, green tea, coffee, or into an infu&s;ion of aromatic herbs,&mdash;flowers, or &s;eeds&mdash;e&s;pecially a mix|ture of mint, ro&s;emary, lavender flowers, and brui&s;ed anni&s;eeds; over which the patient's hands and mouth open may be held, while it continues warm, drawing the vapor with great force into the lungs. In &s;ome ca&s;es it may be advi&s;able to fling a large piece of flannel loo&s;ely over the patient's head, which will more effectually promote per&s;pira|tion. Any of the above, e&s;pecially the latter aromatics, may be u&s;ed afterwards, when almo&s;t cold, to bathe the &s;tomach, private parts, limbs, or feet. The Electrical Aether <HI>alone</HI> may be poured plentifully on the head, brea&s;t, back-bone or limbs of a per&s;on in any low&mdash;nerv|ous&mdash;or putrid complaint: This Aether, camphorated &s;pirits, or vinegar, may be made to di&s;til by a lamp, or be &s;cattered about the room and bed cloaths&mdash;I have often u&s;ed half a dozen guinea bottles of it in one day, on and about one per&s;on, when the ca&s;e has been very bad, and the life very dear and precious. It may be taken inwardly in the quantity of a tea-&s;poonful, more or le&s;s, and as often as may be found good, perhaps every hour or two, on &s;ugar, or mixed with the &s;yrup of capillaire, cold water, wine, or herb tea. The thicker and colder the vehicle, the better: the &s;yrup, or icy cold vehicle &s;hould be poured into an empty vial, then the Aether added to it,
<PB N="24" REF="24">perhaps by gue&s;s, then clo&s;ely &s;topped with the thumb or a cork, well &s;haken and drank immediately.</P>
<P>In the very &s;ame manner, in &s;imilar quantities, and at any or at all times, may be taken the NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM. Indeed, they may be taken together at the &s;ame time; or the latter taken inwardly, while the Electrical Aether is &s;melled to, or applied outwardly; for the one tempers and co-operates with, and promotes the good effects of the other, in &s;o cordial, friendly, and effectual a manner, that they act like a PAIR of crutches to a crippled and en|feebled body. For a more full and particular account of the nature properties, &amp;c. of this Divine Bal&s;am&mdash;or re&s;torative Aetherial Oil, which &s;o effectually renovates and invigorates decayed and worn out con&s;titutions, I refer my intelligent reader to the de&s;criptions already given.</P>
<P>As to the IMPERIAL PILLS, or univer&s;al purifiers and &s;weetners of the blood and juices; they may be taken conveniently at any &s;ea&s;on, and under any circum&s;tance. When they are taken as an alterative, in co&s;tive, gouty, bilious, and &s;corbutic habits, or to throw off wind and flatulencies from the &s;tomach and bowels in nervous weakne&s;&s;es, &s;pa&s;ms, and relaxations, one may be taken every night, or immediately after eating, when a per&s;on is oppre&s;&s;ed and unea&s;y, becau&s;e they &s;o amazingly promote lively dige&s;tion and healthy nouri&s;hment, blunting all acid and bilious acrimony, &s;trengthening the relaxed tone of the &s;tomach, and increa&s;ing the peri&s;taltic or &s;crew-like motion of the inte&s;tines: but when they are taken to &s;ubdue, eradicate, and expel by &s;tool, urine, and a fine breathing per&s;piration all venereal, &s;corbutic, gouty, rheuma|tic, bilious and &s;crophulous humours and foulne&s;&s;es, the patient may begin with one pill, and increa&s;e the do&s;e one every night, till they begin to produce a more copious di&s;charge by &s;tool, urine, or &s;weat, than the patient can or ought to bear long. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the patient may dimini&s;h the number, one every night, till he comes to one only, and then after totally omitting them for as many days as in number he had taken the pills in one day, he may begin again, increa&s;ing the number, one every night as at fir&s;t.&mdash;This mode being ob&s;erved, and repeated &s;everal times,&mdash;will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly&mdash;will infallibly eradicate every particle of virus, di&s;ea&s;e and impurity, however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the &s;y&s;tem, or however inveterately they have been blended and rooted in the con&s;titution, &s;apping or undermining the &s;prings and &s;ources of life and of health, rendering life a tire|&s;ome and painful burthen to the feeble, &s;piritle&s;s, wretched po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or. It is really a&s;toni&s;hing how &s;peedily and effectually the&s;e pills counteract and carry off the deadly effects of Mercury, and other &s;trong and improper medicines. This important and &s;ingular qua|lity
<PB N="25" REF="25">and effects are produced by the large portion of electrical &s;ul|phur or cele&s;tial pho&s;phorous which they contain.</P>
<P>While a per&s;on takes the&s;e mo&s;t excellent pills they may drink as much cold water as they plea&s;e, or go out in any weather. The following drinks will likewi&s;e be very proper,&mdash;chicken, veal, or mutton broth, without &s;alt. Beef-tea, capillaire and cold water. Infu&s;ions of &s;imple herbs, &amp;c. but when the pills are taken for &s;evere and confirmed di&s;ea&s;es, proper regard &s;hould be paid to the nature and degree of the di&s;order or complaint, and the drinks, management, &amp;c.&mdash;ordered accordingly. For in&s;tance, in the ve|nereal, &s;corbutic, or &s;crophulous di&s;ea&s;es, a &s;trong decoction of &s;ar&s;aparilla, or of the guaiacum and &s;a&s;&s;afras woods, with plenty of li|quorice root, &s;hould be drank daily. In gouty, bilious, a&s;thmatic, con&s;umptive, and rheumatic ca&s;es, infu&s;ions of baum, ro&s;emary, tan&s;ey, hor&s;eradi&s;h root, chamomile flowers, pennyroyal, hy&s;op, groundivy, horehound, lin&s;eeds, liquorice root, with brui&s;ed fennil or ani&s;eeds, &s;weetened with treacle, honey, &s;ugar candy, or barley &s;ugar, will be found extremely &s;erviceable; and in all nervous and windy complaints, and in relaxation, irritation and debility of the &s;y&s;tem in general, &s;trong decoctions or rather infu&s;ions of the Peru|vian Bark, in gro&s;s powder, columbo or comfry roots, red ro&s;e leaves, chamomile flowers, bitter orange peel, with a little brui&s;ed cinnamon&mdash;will be productive of the happie&s;t and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing good effects. But in every ca&s;e, and in every con&s;titution, when any one, or all of my Three Great Medicines are taken, I have found half a pint or a whole one of apple tea, water gruel, barley water, or of the following compound infu&s;ion, extremely good and agreeable, viz. of baum, &s;age, ro&s;emary, mint, and brui&s;ed ani&s;eeds&mdash;each an equal quantity, and the tea &s;weetened with &s;ugar candy, barley &s;ugar&mdash;treacle or honey; or rather with a mixture of the two la&s;t. This tea or infu&s;ion &s;hould be drank warm, and indeed very warm and often, when any con&s;i|derable degree of per&s;piration is wi&s;hed for or intended.</P>
<P>In the intervals between taking the medicines, and indeed, in mo&s;t con&s;titutions, even at the time of taking them, a milk diet is warmly recommended. A quart or two, or even three quarts of good new milk may be u&s;ed every day, not warm from the cow, or boiled, but cold, and as it is called, raw: for the natural heat of the human &s;tomach is fully &s;ufficient to cook, or prepare milk, eggs, &amp;c. for every purpo&s;e of nutrition, and of health. The pre|vious application of fire renders them hard and indige&s;tible&mdash;Many people lo&s;e the great&mdash;the un&s;peakable&mdash;the balmy benefit of a milk diet, by relinqui&s;hing it too &s;oon. They find the fir&s;t day or two, a ful|ne&s;s or &s;ickne&s;s at their &s;tomach&mdash;a griping or laxity of their bowels, they therefore conclude that it di&s;agrees with them, and they leave it off. But they ought to continue it by all means for a week or ten
<PB N="26" REF="26">days, and at length it would in general be found to agree per|fectly well, and to produce the happie&s;t effects.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, without taking notice of the general odium there is again&s;t a panacea, or medicine for the cure of <HI>all</HI> di&s;ea&s;es. At fir&s;t I was very far from expecting that even the&s;e three medicines could, &s;ingly, or when combined, cure or even relieve all di&s;orders; but as I advanced in improving them, and in di&s;covering their virtues in actual and mo&s;t exten&s;ive practice, I confe&s;s that my wonder and &s;urpri&s;e exceeded the a&s;toni&s;hment and delight which was excited in my happy patients. The wonderful good effects which I &s;ay are produced by the&s;e medicines in every ca&s;e, and in every con&s;titution, will, <HI>at fir&s;t &s;ight,</HI> alarm and di&s;gu&s;t per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and learning, but on candid and mature views of the&s;e matters, they will be found to agree with, and to re&s;ult from the fixt nature of things:&mdash;for the general notion of di&s;ea&s;es rea&s;onably con&s;i&s;ts in this; that what is taken into the body is not duly a&s;&s;imilated and di&s;tributed by the force of the animal oeconomy. Is it not, therefore, true that what|ever a&s;&s;i&s;ts and &s;trengthens the vis vitae, enables nature either to a&s;&s;imilate, or to di&s;charge all gro&s;s and noxious particles, un&s;ubdued humours, and in a word, the &s;eeds or cau&s;es of all di&s;ea&s;es what&s;oever? for the cele&s;tial or electrical Light or Aether detained in the&s;e me|dicines, and with which they are &s;o fully impregnated or &s;aturated, being of the very &s;ame nature with the animal &s;pirits, or nervous cla&s;tic light or fluid, is an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;o much &s;trength to the con|&s;titution or powers of nature, or &s;taff of life, by which it is a&s;&s;i&s;ted to a&s;&s;imilate whatever is friendly and nouri&s;hing, or to throw off or ex|pel whatever is alien or noxious to her nature,&mdash;or prejudicial to good health. Thus, then, the&s;e great medicines may be ju&s;tly called univer&s;al ones, ina&s;much as they work principally by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the vis vitae, or &s;taff of life, as an alterative and cordial, enabling nature by a prodigious acce&s;&s;ion of congenial vital &s;pirits, to a&s;&s;imilate tho&s;e friendly and nece&s;&s;ary recruits or powers, which could not be a&s;&s;imilated by her own proper force, for &s;ubduing di&s;ea&s;es or maintain|ing health. Tho&s;e who think that this cannot be effectually done but by &s;trong evacuations, entertain a mo&s;t dangerous opinion; for great and repeated evacuations weaken <HI>nature</HI> as well as the di&s;ea&s;e; and thou&s;ands who have recovered of di&s;tempers by great evacuations, and poi&s;onous medicines, &s;uch as mercury, &amp;c. have never, during their whole life, been able to recover of the remedies.&mdash;But the luminous&mdash;balmy&mdash;cele&s;tial &s;pirit or fire which is lodged and detained in the&s;e three Great Medicines, is of a nature &s;o mild, benign, and propor|tioned to the human con&s;titution, as to warm without heating, to cheer but not inebriate or inflame, and to produce that calm &s;erenity, that &s;teady joy which naturally accompanies good health, and a virtuous mind:&mdash;and that too without tho&s;e agitations, irregular motions, and &s;ub&s;equent horrible &s;inkings or depre&s;&s;ions of the
<PB N="27" REF="27">animal &s;pirits, which are the con&s;tant and in&s;eparable effects of volatile &s;alts, &s;pirits, foreign waters, and drams; and indeed of all fermented, vinous, &s;piritous, and even malt-liquors.</P>
<P>N. B. The&s;e great,&mdash;the&s;e truly cele&s;tial medicines, will keep good any length of time, and in any climate, provided they are kept very tightly &s;topped and as cool as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>&dtristar; In a few days will be publi&s;hed and added to this pamphlet, about fifty extraordinary cures, lately effected by my three great medicines. In the mean time I have authority to mention the fol|lowing very extraordinary ca&s;e of a re&s;pectable and very amiable young lady, a Mi&s;s Beatt, at Mr. Schroeder's Ware-Hou&s;e, (Robe and Habit-Maker to Her Maje&s;ty) in Tavi&s;tock-Street, Covent|Garden,&mdash;late Pritchard and Spil&s;bury's.</P>
<P>About the beginning of la&s;t March, Mi&s;s Beatt was &s;eized with a &s;evere di&s;order which broke out on one &s;ide of her face, and &s;pread to her eye, ear, neck, and throat. It was taken, and properly at|tended to, from the very beginning; but, neverthele&s;s in two or three weeks it had &s;pread over both &s;ides of her face and neck, which with both her eyes and ears, it had &s;welled to a mon&s;trous degree. The humour was &s;o &s;harp and &s;o exce&s;&s;ively profu&s;e, that day and night it would wet and run thro' twenty folds of cloths or handkerchiefs in one quarter of an hour, but notwith&s;tanding that incredible di&s;charge the &s;wellings did not abate, and tho&s;e under her ear, and about her throat, were as hard as a &s;tone. The cata&s;trophe of the &s;cene being now at hand, and the young Lady her&s;elf, her affectionate father, and her anxious friends, being alarmed and apprehen&s;ive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences&mdash;the &s;ervices of the Medical Gentlemen who attended her were di&s;pen&s;ed with, and I was called in. The chilly &s;hivering coldne&s;s, which indeed had been a mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ymptom from the beginning, encrea&s;ed, now, very fa&s;t.&mdash;The terrible humour began to fall inward, and to be ab&s;orbed into her blood, which it di&s;&s;olved and broke down into a putrid watery gore; and on the Sunday morning I found her laying with &s;carce any pul&s;e&mdash;cold, &s;leepy like, complaining that &s;he could not &s;wallow, and of a dead coldne&s;s in her limbs, on her left &s;ide particularly,&mdash;and a want of &s;mell and all &s;en&s;e of feeling in one &s;ide of her no&s;e. Her face, neck, eyes and ears were entirely co|vered over with a thick black cold cru&s;t or &s;cab&mdash;like a complete ma&s;k,&mdash;&s;he had been quite blind for near two days, and on examining her throat inwardly, I found the mortification there far advanced. From the&s;e &s;ymptoms and appearances, joined to what is called the
<PB N="28" REF="28">rattles in her throat, which had now come on, and the putrid &s;mell which, notwith&s;tanding every precaution, began to &s;pread all over the hou&s;e, every body was per&s;uaded that the melancholy &s;cene would be clo&s;ed in a very few hours; and I my&s;elf was apprehen&s;ive that the deadly &s;weep in the hou&s;e might be great; a gentleman, a few &s;treets off, his wife, and &s;ome of their children and &s;ervants having been all &s;wept into the grave by a putrid di&s;order within the &s;pace of one week, a few days before:&mdash;to whom I regret exceedingly, that I had not the good fortune to be called. But to return. What was to be done?&mdash;Mi&s;s Beatt could not &s;wallow but a few drops at a time, and that very &s;lowly, and with the greate&s;t languor and danger of &s;uffocation.</P>
<P>No time was to be lo&s;t with the patient, nor any thing left undone for the &s;ecurity of the family. Every window in the hou&s;e, which Mrs Schroeder had very judiciou&s;ly thrown open, and the frankin|cen&s;e and other aromatics which that lady had wi&s;ely burned on the &s;tairs, by way of fumigation, were, (with the addition of camphorated aether to &s;prinkle with) all continued.</P>
<P>I immediately mixed a large vial of my NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM, and another of my ELECTRICAL AETHER, with an equal quantity of the &s;yrup of capillaire to &s;often them.&mdash;Of this mixture, I gave Mi&s;s Beatt &s;poonful after &s;poonful, as fa&s;t as &s;he could let it over, till &s;he had taken the whole of it. That part of it which run out of her mouth was not lo&s;t; for it was ab&s;orbed by her neck and brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of a quarter of an hour, I u&s;ed no le&s;s than three whole vials of my ELECTRICAL AETHER on her face, neck, throat, &amp;c.&mdash;Another very large vial, containing four ounces or one Guinea's worth of it, was held continually to her no&s;trils, and &s;ome of it a little diluted, was thrown into her no&s;trils, and upon her throat in|wardly, with a &s;yringe; and an infu&s;ion with boiling water was im|mediately prepared, of half a pound of the fine&s;t Peruvian bark, and an ounce of cinnamon, both in powder, and half a pound of red ro&s;e leaves.&mdash;To this, when &s;trained, no le&s;s than half a pint of Mr. Jones's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jones, who is a chymi&s;t and druggi&s;t in Ru&s;&s;el Street, Covent Garden, is a man of fortune and character, and particularly attentive in having the be&s;t and mo&s;t genuine medicines that can be procured.</NOTE> very excellent tincture of the bark, was added. This was exhibited very often by way of gly&s;ter, and a cupful of it drank as often as po&s;&s;ible. But before it could be prepared, I had given Mi&s;s Beatt another whole large vial of my nervous aetherial bal&s;am, and had &s;prinkled the bed|cloaths well, all over, with my electrical aether&mdash;a large bli&s;ter like|wi&s;e was applied between her &s;houlders, and one <HI>under</HI> each collar bone,
<PB N="29" REF="29">backward, towards the top of her &s;houlders. What were the effects of the&s;e bold&mdash;the&s;e great operations?&mdash;They were mo&s;t happy!&mdash;They appeared miraculous!&mdash;They &s;natched an amiable young per&s;on&mdash;an u&s;eful member of &s;ociety&mdash;I may &s;ay, from the very bottom of the grave. What would ordinary medicines&mdash;what would, what is called the <HI>regular</HI> practice, have done in this de&s;perate ca&s;e?&mdash;why&mdash;nothing. The patient MUST INEVITABLY HAVE DIED. How very fortunate it was for Mi&s;s Beatt that I was per&s;onally pre&s;ent to direct the proper exhibition of the three great medicines&mdash;to which under God! &s;he owes her life! In a quarter of an hour, from the time that the aetherial bal&s;am was <HI>fir&s;t</HI> given to her,&mdash;&s;he broke out into a general per&s;piration; her pul&s;e was better;&mdash;the fulne&s;s, choaking, and inability of &s;wallowing went off; the rattles cea&s;ed. At the end of another half hour, all the&s;e favourable appearances were more &s;trikingly manife&s;ted:&mdash;and at the expiration of one hour more, &s;o rapidly did the cold numbne&s;s and &s;leepine&s;s go off, and the mor|tification, and putrefaction abate, that I conceived her to be even out of all danger. The putrid morbid matter which had fallen inward, and carried death to every ve&s;&s;el and fibre of the &s;y&s;tem being now &s;o much overcome and &s;ubdued by the nervous aetherial bal&s;am, and electrical aether, I was determined to lo&s;e no time in carrying as much of it as po&s;&s;ible out of the body. For that purpo&s;e, as Mi&s;s Beatt could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be as yet capable of &s;wallowing <HI>pills</HI>&mdash;and even if &s;he could, it would have been a con&s;iderable time before they could have di&s;&s;olved in her &s;tomach: I therefore di&s;&s;olved nine of my IMPERIAL PILLS in a proper vehicle, and gave the whole of them to her in the &s;pace of an hour. The con&s;equence was, that they operated &s;o properly and effectually, that I ventured to leave her that &s;ame night, being called into the city to attend to &s;ome ca&s;es of great importance.</P>
<P>I had ordered my &s;ervant to enquire after Mi&s;s Beatt by &s;ix in the morning, and a gentleman, (a &s;urgeon in the Ea&s;t-India Company's &s;ervice) who had the goodne&s;s to &s;it up all night, being on a vi&s;it at Mr. Schroeder's, (and to who&s;e kind and judicious care we were all very much indebted,) &s;ent me word that Mi&s;s Beatt was amazingly better, that &s;he had &s;lept &s;weetly great part of the night, that &s;he was then refre&s;hed and cheerful, with both her eyes quite open, and every unfavourable &s;ymptom entirely gone off.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s any longer on my reader's time; &s;uffice it to a&s;&s;ure him, that by continuing the medicines, &amp;c. in one week or ten days more Mi&s;s Beatt came down &s;tairs quite recovered. The black cru&s;ty &s;cabs or ma&s;k dropt off her face, neck, head, throat and eats en|tirely; &s;he was once more perfectly her&s;elf,&mdash;and free from every &s;pot, redne&s;s, or di&s;agteeable appearance&mdash;and with a good appetite, and high &s;pirits, &s;he has continued perfectly well ever &s;ince; and thinks
<PB N="30" REF="30">that &s;he even enjoys better health than &s;he did before &s;he was attacked with that terrible di&s;order:&mdash;and, it plea&s;ed God, that not one individual of that large and re&s;pectable family &s;uffered an hour's illne&s;s from the imminent danger which had threatened them.</P>
<P>N. B. Very few of the fifty cures lately performed by the&s;e medi|cines, which have been &s;elected from a much greater number, and which are now printing, are le&s;s extraordinary or important than this above-mentioned.</P>

<P>DR. GRAHAM's new and improved methods of curing di&s;ea&s;es con&s;i&s;t in regimen, herbs, &s;imple medicines, the choice&s;t arti|cles of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and aetherial e&s;&s;ences, rendered more &s;alu|tary and active by means of the mo&s;t powerful vital agents in nature, viz. Electricity, Vivifying Air, Medical Mu&s;ic, and Magneti&s;m; or in other words, by gently conveying to tho&s;e at the Altar, or on the Medico-electrical Throne, without &s;hock, or any kind of unea&s;ine&s;s,

Dr. Graham. therefore, for the public good, as well as for his own honour and emolument, THINKS IT HIS DUTY to depart from what is called the regular mode, by giving this public notice, which is addre&s;&s;ed to THE FRIENDS OF PERSONS APPARENTLY AT THE POINT OF DEATH, and to every individual who labours under any kind of complaint or infirmity which has re&s;i&s;ted the ordinary remedies.&mdash;To &s;uch, in whatever &s;tation of life, this Adverti&s;ement is addre&s;&s;ed; but more e&s;pecially to the charitably di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tian&mdash;to the affectionate Parent&mdash;the dutiful Child&mdash;the fond Compannion&mdash;and the tender&mdash;the anxious Friend.</P>

Violently dangerous Fevers, particularly &s;carlet, putrid, and nervous ones&mdash;Con&s;ump|tions, A&s;thmas and Coughs &mdash; excruciating pain and imminent danger from the Gout in the head or &s;tomach&mdash;Apoplexy&mdash;putrid ulcerated Throats&mdash;Stone and Gravel&mdash;inflamations of the Brain, Lungs, Bowels, or Bladder&mdash;ob&s;tinate and confirmed VENEREAL com|plaints, from repeated infections and irregularities, or from having been neglected, trifled with, or improperly treated with that deadly poi&s;on mercury, &s;evere purging, &amp;c.&mdash;Stomach and Bowel complaints&mdash;total &s;uppre&s;&s;ions of Urine too&mdash;relaxing, &s;inking; weakne&s;&s;e&s;s, and the more immediately dangerous FEMALE COMPLAINTS&mdash;Fits, Spa&s;ms, and Convul&s;ions, e&s;pecially in children and young people&mdash;the Mea&s;les, Small-pox, Mortifications, nervous and con|&s;umptive Weakne&s;&s;es&mdash;immoderate Fluxes&mdash;&s;evere fits of Coughing, Suffocation or A&s;thma&mdash;acute, bilious, and other Ob&s;tructions&mdash;the Drop&s;y, recent &s;trokes of the Pal&s;y, &amp;c. In the&s;e, and in mo&s;t other di&s;ea&s;es, particularly in glandular and white Swellings; com|plicated, &s;evere, and wandering Rheumati&s;ms; the rheumatic Gout; ob&s;tinate Scurvies; in Blindne&s;s and in Deafne&s;s too, and mo&s;t of the di&s;orders of tho&s;e mo&s;t precious and mo&s;t delicate organs the eye and ear, his medicines, and gentle aetherial and electrical applica|tions, produce the mo&s;t amazing good effects: they open ob&s;truc|tions, promote a due and regular circulation of the blood and &s;pirits,
<PB N="32" REF="32">which they &s;weeten, purify, enrich, and animate; nouri&s;hing, bracing, and coiling up the nervous &s;y&s;tem when weakened and relaxed; overcoming every degree of putrefaction, recruiting decayed &s;trength, and generally acting on an exhau&s;ted body like fre&s;h oil poured into an expiring lamp. After all, however, Dr. Graham is far from pretending to work miracles or impo&s;&s;ibilities. No: he is abundantly &s;en&s;ible of the impo&s;&s;ibility of curing many di&s;ea&s;es in their advanced and confirmed &s;tages; and of the fallibility and un|certainty of all &s;ublunary things; all that he contends for is, that his methods of treating di&s;ea&s;es are far more powerful, &s;afe and rational, than tho&s;e in general employed by any other Phy&s;ician in the world, and that he often &s;ucceeds in curing effectually and la&s;tingly, di&s;ea&s;es internal and external, when the mo&s;t celebrated Surgeons and Phy&s;icians, and even when the more friendly powers of regimen, air, exerci&s;e, and the be&s;t mineral waters have failed.</P>
<P>So amazingly has his bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed, that he has <HI>now</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary, from motives of humanity more than for his own emolu|ment, to fit up additional appartments, and to receive at any hour of the day &s;uch &s;ick and lame Per&s;ons as cannot afford to give fees for advice; and that they are now admitted daily, Sundays excepted, from eight o'clock in the morning, till eight at night, to whom advice, and all nece&s;&s;ary medico-electrical operations, &amp;c. are admini&s;tered <HI>gratis,</HI> in rotation, according to priority of arrival, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, paying the Apothecary for &s;uch medicines only (if any) as their re&s;pec|tive ca&s;es require. But as the greate&s;t hindrances have ari&s;en from multitudes crowding into the TEMPLE OF HEALTH, under the pre|tence of attending &s;ick friends, but merely to gratify their curio&s;ity, by &s;taring at the apparatus, to obviate, therefore, in future, tho&s;e incon|veniencies and impertinencies, and that as many di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons as po&s;&s;ible may partake of the &s;alutary effects of this GRAND SYSTEM OF HEALING! no poor per&s;on whatever will be admitted without a ticket, which mu&s;t be had of the porter, price Half-a-Crown. This is required only at the fir&s;t con&s;ultation; for Dr. Graham, on re|ceiving it, gives another ticket <HI>gratis,</HI> which admits the patient during the whole cour&s;e of the cure.&mdash;No &s;ort of objection, how|ever, is made to <HI>one</HI> friend attending each patient&mdash;that being often nece&s;&s;ary, as well as decent.</P>
<P>The nobility, gentry, and others in genteel or ea&s;y circum&s;tances, mu&s;t pay a Guinea the fir&s;t con&s;ultation, and at lea&s;t Half a-Guinea every time after. No per&s;ons whom&s;oever, even per&s;onages of high rank, need expect to be attended at their own hou&s;es, unle&s;s confined to bed by &s;ickne&s;s, or to their room through extreme weakne&s;s; and from tho&s;e whom he attends at their own hou&s;es, Two Guineas the fir&s;t, and one Guinea each vi&s;it after, is expected. Dr. Graham, for rea&s;ons of the highe&s;t importance to the public, as well as to him&s;elf, has a large chemical laboratory, and great medicinal cabinets in his
<PB N="33" REF="33">own hou&s;e; and in the above fixed fees, either at home or abroad, every expence attending his advice, medicines, applications, operations, and influences is included&mdash;a few tedious, complex, and expen&s;ive operations in the great Apollo apartment only excepted. But in ca&s;es where electricity or attendance are not nece&s;&s;ary, and medicines are required to be taken at home, or when any are &s;ent into the country, if they are furni&s;hed and prepared by Dr. Graham's Chemi&s;ts, or Apothecaries, they mu&s;t be paid for &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Before he concludes this addre&s;s, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay a few words on the dangerous, and even fatal effects which may be pro|duced by &s;o mighty an agent as the electrical fire, in the hands of ignorant and ra&s;h people. So very powerful an element cannot be indifferent when applied to the human body; it mu&s;t do con&s;iderable good or con&s;iderable harm; &s;triking in&s;tances of both have repeatedly fallen under Dr. Graham's ob&s;ervations;&mdash;and he trembles with apprehen&s;ion for his fellow-creatures, when he &s;ees in almo&s;t every &s;treet in this great metropolis, a Barber&mdash;a Surgeon&mdash;a Tooth|drawer&mdash;an Apothecary&mdash;or a common Mechanic turned electrical operator. How dangerous!&mdash;how ridiculous mu&s;t it be in mo&s;t ca&s;es to venture &s;o curious, &s;o complex, and &s;o delicate a machine as the human body, and that too, even when di&s;ea&s;ed, into &s;uch hands to be &s;hook, torn, and convul&s;ed with the ignorant and improper application of this awful element!</P>
<P>For his own part, he has been taught by rea&s;on, and by the mo&s;t attentive ob&s;ervations in innumerable experiments on almo&s;t every &s;ub&s;tance in nature, and in a cour&s;e of practice in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, far more exten&s;ive than that of perhaps any other man in the world, he has been taught, that all violence is hurtful; that ELECTRICAL SHOCKS OUGHT SELDOM OR NEVER TO BE GIVEN; that partial frictions, &s;parks and bru&s;hings, with rich me|dicinal &s;ub&s;tances charged with electricity, or gently pervading the whole &s;y&s;tem with a copious tide of that cele&s;tial fire, fully impreg|nated with the pure&s;t, mo&s;t &s;ubtile, and balmie&s;t parts of medicines, which are extracted by, and flow &s;oftly into the blood and nervous &s;y&s;tem, with the electrical fluid, or re&s;torative aetherial e&s;&s;ences. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where &s;hocks are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in&s;tead of charging bottles lined with tin foil, or other gro&s;s, impure, and perhaps ar|&s;enical metals, his jars are filled with load&s;tones, &s;ulphur, quick&s;ilver, and with the milde&s;t, yet mo&s;t active medicinal &s;ub&s;tances from the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms:&mdash;the&s;e are charged with the cele&s;tial Fire, &s;olar vital Light, vivifying Air, and with the powerful, and &s;alutary <HI>effluvia</HI> of oriental Bal&s;ams, aromatic Oils, Peruvian Bark, Ca&s;tor, Camphire, Mu&s;k, Ambergrea&s;e, the Bal&s;ams of Ju|niper, Peru, Tolu, and Gilead: and the influences of Electricity&punc; Air, aetherial medicines, and magneti&s;m, thus combined, and po|&s;itively charged with the pure cele&s;tial fire, or with the magnetic,
<PB N="34" REF="34">Effluvium, are made to pa&s;s through the whole or any particular part of the patient's body, giving, in &s;uch ca&s;es as require them, a great number or quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ant little vibratory SHOCKS, &s;o genial and gentle as not to hurt or alarm even an infant. But, as he &s;aid before, he generally prefers the <HI>effluvia</HI> of the&s;e genial, aromatic, bal&s;amic, anti&s;pa&s;modic &s;ub&s;tances, or the <HI>effluvia</HI> of the magnetic, a&euml;rial, or aetherial e&s;&s;ences, pa&s;&s;ing &s;ilently, &s;weetly, and in&s;en&s;ibly into the body, or confined to the &s;eat or cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, while the &s;pa&s;modic ten&s;ions and &s;tiffne&s;&s;es are relaxed&mdash;or the relaxed and debilitated tone of the nerves or mu&s;cular fibres braced up, or invigorated, as the ca&s;e or con&s;titution requires, with the above, and with properly adapted harmonious vibrations, or mu&s;ical modulations of cele&s;tial &s;ounds.</P>
<P>Le&s;t it &s;hould be thought that Dr. Graham u&s;es electricity in ALL ca&s;es, he de&s;ires to inform the public, that many of his greate&s;t and mo&s;t extraordinary cures have been done entirely without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of electricity; and that he makes it an invariable rule to reject the incurable&mdash;and to inform every patient, or their friends, at fir&s;t fight, whether a perfect cure, or what degree of relief may be expected.</P>
<P>Dr. Graham, after a regular, cla&s;&s;ical, and medical education of many years, at the ju&s;tly celebrated univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, and after attending to the practice in the be&s;t Ho&s;pitals, and the lectures of the greate&s;t Phy&s;icians in London, Dublin, &amp;c. became exceedingly di&s;&s;atisfied at the trifling ab&s;urdities and feeblene&s;s of what is called the regular practice of Phy&s;ic: but animated with the hopes of being able to make valuable di&s;coveries, and important improvements in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, and for the prolongation of human life, he tra|velled into various foreign countries, making, in the cour&s;e of twelve years, &s;everal tours thro' the continent of Europe, and over the ex|ten&s;ive provinces of America; at length, after gathering and dige&s;ting the falre&s;t flowers and the choice&s;t fruits of the &s;ciences, by conver&s;|ing with and attending to the labours and the lectures of the mo&s;t learned and mo&s;t ingenious men in every country thro' which he pa&s;&s;ed; after inve&s;tigating the nature and properties of the various natural productions, and making the mo&s;t accurate chymical analy&s;es of the mo&s;t celebrated mineral waters in Europe; he returned to Britain, and after fitting up, with infinite labour and expence, the mo&s;t powerful, mo&s;t u&s;eful, and mo&s;t magnificent medical apparatus that ever was in the world, he has now practi&s;ed a whole year in the metropolis of his native country, and of the world! with the greate&s;t honour and emolument to him&s;elf, and to the greate&s;t benefit and ad|vantage of thou&s;ands of his fellow creatures of every rank and deno|mination, who had laboured under pains and di&s;ea&s;es which the be&s;t regular practitioners, and the mo&s;t powerful medicines in common u&s;e; could neither cure nor alleviate.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="35">
<P>The &s;ame and emoluments which Dr. Graham in con&s;equence of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, is honoured with, have long &s;ince placed him in a &s;phere which is an object of envy to the &s;elfi&s;h and narrow-minded part of the faculty; but which neither the envy, jea|lous and mean artifices, nor the illiberal, fal&s;e, and wicked repre&s;enta|tions, in&s;inuations, and libels of theatrical buffoons or of ra&s;cally avaricious editors of news papers have been able to remove him from. Let them continue to act&mdash;to print, and to publi&s;h whatever their avaricious and diabolical nature prompts them to. Dr. Graham ne|ver has, nor ever will take the lea&s;t notice, or an&s;wer one of them. No; He looks down upon them all with &s;miles of &s;overeign&mdash;of in|effible contempt!&mdash;What!&mdash;&s;hall the genial&mdash;the life-giving Sun cea&s;e to &s;hine becau&s;e his beams offend the weak or di&s;torted eyes of tho&s;e foul animals&mdash;tho&s;e vile, venomous reptiles which a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate and devour in the dark?&mdash;Dr. G. has, at lea&s;t, the negative con&s;o|lation, that tho&s;e villainous and lying repre&s;enters of things which con|cern him, cannot treat HIM wor&s;e than they have done his betters.&mdash;even the FIRST, mo&s;t re&s;pectable, mo&s;t innocent, and even the mo&s;t &s;acred characters in the Briti&s;h Dominions. The liberal and di&s;cerning public can readily di&s;tingui&s;h true merit from pretended knowledge.&mdash;Facts are incontrovertible&mdash;his &s;uperiority is univer|&s;ally acknowleged. He ba&s;ks in the &s;un&s;hine of riches and honour. He rejoices in the applau&s;e of the candid and of the learned world&mdash;he exults in the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience,&mdash;and in the approbation of his own heart!</P>
<P>But, in order to remove <HI>effectually</HI> every unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion which the jealous and envious in&s;inuations of the faculty or their friends, ALARMED AT DR. GRAHAM'S UNPRECEDENTED FAME AND SUCCESS, may have created in the minds of tho&s;e who are unacquainted with Dr. Graham and his valuable di&s;coveries and improvements; and to demon&s;trate to the world at large the infinite &s;uperiority of his peculiar modes of treating di&s;ea&s;es, he will continue for another year, to attend at their own home, patients in &s;evere ACUTE di&s;ea&s;es, when given over for death by any other, even by the mo&s;t celebrated Apothecary, Surgeon, or Phy&s;ician, without any expence whatever, either for attendance, advice, or medicines, <HI>(the fir&s;t fee only excepted)</HI> if his endeavours to pre&s;erve life, under God! prove ineffectual. When re&s;tored to health his gratuity &s;hall, as u&s;ual, be regulated by the genero&s;ity or circum&s;tances of the patient, <HI>No ordinary or trifling ca&s;e will be attended to:</HI> THE ABOVE IS CONFINED TO THOSE&mdash;AND TO THOSE ALONE, WHO ARE THOUGHT TO BE NEAR DEATH IN SEVERE ACUTE DIS|EASES. Seldom, <HI>very &s;eldom</HI> a day pa&s;&s;es, but he has the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of ea&s;ing excruciating pain, and of &s;natching from the grave one or more &s;ick per&s;ons, even when &s;truggling in the agonies of death, and even after they have been abandoned by the the mo&s;t celebrated
<PB N="36" REF="36">Phy&s;icians. Indeed, &s;o very amazing, &s;o unprecedented has been the &s;ucce&s;s which has attended his practice, that not more than three or four per&s;ons have died in the whole cour&s;e or circuit of his practice during the la&s;t twelve months&mdash;of the multitudes who come or are brought every day to his hou&s;e&mdash;or of tho&s;e whom he has been &s;ent for to attend, when near death, at their own habitations. While he a&s;&s;ures the public of the above fact, he defies the whole world to di&s;prove the truth of it. Such &s;uece&s;s is an honour of which few other Phy&s;icians can boa&s;t&mdash;a plea&s;ure which very few have experienced:&mdash;Nor, than the above, can any thing &s;o effectually demon&s;trate the infinite &s;uperiority of his methods of treating di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially as it is well known, that for &s;everal years pa&s;t he &s;eldom has had le&s;s than one hundred per&s;ons every day under his care, and often more than even double that number. He may, therefore, with the Poet exclaim!</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS this great &s;y&s;tem of Healing, and of encreafing the number and happine&s;s of the human &s;pecies, which I have with &s;o much labor and expence explored, and now happily confirmed, is of the highe&s;t importance, not only to the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h empire at pre&s;ent, but likewi&s;e to the whole human &s;pecies throughout the whole earth, and perhaps for thou&s;ands of years to come, I propo&s;e to continue to practi&s;e in this great metropolis of my native country, till the beginning of the year 1783&mdash;which will be a period of full three years&mdash;in order to demon|&s;trate to the entire &s;atisfaction of per&s;ons of every rank, from the throne to the cottage, the facility, certainty, and, in a word, the infinite &s;uperiority of my methods of propagation in difficult ca&s;es, of preventing and curing all curable di&s;ea&s;es, external as well as internal, to which the human body is liable, and of extending life free from &s;ickne&s;s, and with the clear healthy exerci&s;e of the men|tal faculties, to the longe&s;t po&s;&s;ible period.&mdash;At the expiration of the three years, I intend to make propo&s;als to the BRITISH PARLIAMENT concerning publi&s;hing to the world all my di&s;|coveries, improvements, and methods of propagation, and of ma|naging and curing di&s;ea&s;es, &amp;c. without any re&s;erve whatever; and that I may continue to communicate, from time to time, &s;uch farther di&s;coveries and improvements as a&s;&s;iduous inve&s;tiga|tion, and a practice with an apparatus more potent and more ex|ten&s;ive than that of any other Phy&s;ician on the face of the globe, &s;hall enable me to make.</P>
<P>If I do not meet with that benevolence and encouragement from the LEGISLATURE of my own country, which the va&s;t impor|tance of the object merits&mdash;I propo&s;e to re&s;ide and practi&s;e about a year at each of the principal courts in Europe; and after that, under the royal and imperial au&s;pices of European wi&s;dom and munificence at large, I will then publi&s;h to mankind the great pro|lific CODE, and SYSTEM OF HEALTH and of the HEALING ART, which I am now dige&s;ting, compiling and perfecting as far as the experience of one age will permit&mdash;I &s;ay one Age, becau&s;e I am now e&s;tabli&s;hing a medical corre&s;pondence in every part of the world&mdash;for the univer&s;al improvement and perfection of Medical and Chirurgical Science. Would to God that a Franklin, a Prie&s;tley, and &s;everal other great and learned men I could name, had been practi&s;ing phy&s;icians, what might not be expected from the indefatigable labours of &s;uch bright and penetrating intelli|gencies!</P>
<P>In order to le&s;&s;en my fatigue in bu&s;ine&s;s and for the good of the public, as well as for my own private emolument, I propo&s;e im|mediately to take as pupils and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, three gentlemen who have had the advantages, if not of a medical, at lea&s;t of a liberal or cla&s;&s;ical education.&mdash;To prevent all trouble, the premium I I demand from each is a thou&s;and guineas prompt, and an hun|dred guineas per ann. for board, &amp;c. while he remains in my hou&s;e.</P>
