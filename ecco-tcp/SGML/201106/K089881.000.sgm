<HEAD>OF THE NOTTINGTON WATER.</HEAD>
<P>NOTTINGTON is a &s;mall Hamlet, between five and &s;ix miles from Dorche&s;ter; about the di&s;tance of two miles from Weymouth; nearly a furlong we&s;tward of the turnpike road, between the&s;e two towns.</P>
<P>The mineral &s;pring of this place has long been in great repute, for the cure of various di&s;ea&s;es, both by its external, and internal u&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which generally attracts the notice of tho&s;e who examine this Wa|ter,
<PB N="6" REF="5">is the bri&s;k &s;mell of &s;ulphur it copiou|&s;ly emits, plainly evincing a &s;trong im|pregnation of that mineral.</P>
<P>In attempting to de&s;cribe the flavour of any particular mineral water, words are never &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of it, &s;o as to come up to its genuine ta&s;te.</P>
<P>This Spring in the opinion of many, re&s;embles very much to the palate, a weak &s;olution of &s;al polychre&s;t; it has been com|pared to a boiled egg by &s;ome, &s;omewhat &s;tale, and by others to rotten eggs.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice however to &s;ay of the Nottington Water, that it is by no means &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting as &s;ulphureous waters in ge|neral prove, and appears to be much le&s;s &s;o to many people, than tho&s;e of Harrogate, and Cheltenham.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>With re&s;pect to its &s;pecific gravity, when compared with that of di&s;tilled wa|ter by means of the hydro&s;tatical balance, the difference between them is &s;o trifling, as not to be an object of any con&s;ideration on that account, the latter is rather the lighter of the two.</P>
<P>In colour it has a milky, &s;light blue tinge, which appears to be con&s;iderably heightened by viewing the Water in a tin ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>That there is an acidity in this water is not to be doubted in the lea&s;t, from its property of turning white on being mixed with alkalis, and from its curdling im|mediately with &s;oap.</P>
<P>This acid is mo&s;t undoubtedly inherent in its &s;ulphur, and affords a perfect con&s;u|tation
<PB N="8" REF="7">of the opinion, which that learned Phy&s;ician Dr. Stahll, mo&s;t erroneou&s;ly maintained, viz. <HI>"That Acids do not pre|exi&s;t in Sulphur, but are merely Creatures of the Fire."</HI> An a&s;&s;ertion ea&s;ily di&s;proved in later times, by all who are become bet|ter acquainted with the component parts of this mineral, by the progre&s;&s;ive im|provements made in chemi&s;try.</P>
<P>That the Nottington Water abounds with an alkali, manife&s;tly appears, from an analy&s;is of its component parts, by the u&s;ual proce&s;s of evaporation&mdash;The &s;alt which is afterwards extracted from the in&s;oluble re&s;iduum, on being well rubbed into raw meat, occa&s;ions it to turn very red, in conformity to the well known property of alkaline nitre.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>That it has no chalybeate or &s;errugin|ous impregnation is mo&s;t readily inferred, from a tincture of galls or &s;uch other a&s;trin|gent having no further effect in changing the appearance of the Water than giving a &s;light tinge of an amber ca&s;t, &s;carcely deeper than &s;traw colour.&mdash;And it does not appear that it borrows any impregna|tion from the pyrites which u&s;ually gives the &s;prings in the neighbourhood where it abounds their ferruginous and chalybeate qualities.&mdash;The &s;tones in the vicinity of the well apparently re&s;emble common &s;tones, and the neighbouring &s;prings do not differ at all from common &s;imple water.</P>
<P>That it contains no oker is pre&s;umed on the fir&s;t in&s;pection of the water, &s;uch
<PB N="10" REF="9">mineral &s;prings as evidently contain oker have a yellow matter re&s;embling a &s;ort of thin cream floating on their &s;urface, and the &s;tones at the bottom and &s;ides of &s;uch &s;prings, are mo&s;t commonly tinged very much with the &s;ame&mdash;nothing of which is di&s;coverable here, or in any &s;pring in the neighbourhood of the well.</P>
<P>That the &s;alt contained in the Notting|ton Water is not of &s;ufficient &s;trength to re&s;train the volatility of the &s;ulphur, ap|pears from the effluvia before mentioned, which it &s;o readily and plentifully gives off.</P>
<P>In evaporating the water, this &s;ulphur|cous &s;mell is entirely removed by the time half the water is exhaled in the operation,</P>
<P>The proce&s;s of evaporating four quarts of the water to dryne&s;s in the common
<PB N="11" REF="10">way, leaves about two &s;cruples or &s;ome|what more of a brown reddi&s;h ma&s;s.</P>
<P>If however a gla&s;s retort is made u&s;e of, and the water is drawn off by a very gentle &s;and heat with great circum&s;pect|ion, almo&s;t a third more, may be gained from the &s;ame quantity of the water.</P>
<P>The &s;alt which is afterwards extracted from the in&s;oluble re&s;iduum, is in the pro|portion of ten grains to two, of the latter.</P>
<P>This &s;alt when mixed with &s;pirit of vitri|ol, cau&s;es a very con&s;iderable ebullition; affording thereby e&s;&s;ential evidence of its alkaline quality, in addition to what has already been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>When this &s;alt is rubbed with &s;al am|moniac, it has an urinous pungent &s;mell, and when it is mixed with &s;alt of tartar,
<PB N="12" REF="11">it gives off rather an offen&s;ive foetid odour.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that a very pretty experiment may be made with this water, after being kept a proper time, and this without the trouble of a regular chemical proce&s;s.</P>
<P>By keeping the Nottington Water in bottles, for the &s;pace of a twelvemonth, or more; it affords a &s;pontaneous partial analy&s;is of it&s;elf, light bodies of different colours are ob&s;erved floating on its &s;ur|face, the&s;e are the &s;ulphureous particles now all collected together, which were ori|ginally diffu&s;ed throughout the &s;ub&s;tance of the whole.&mdash;The&s;e &s;lender corpu&s;cles if carefully taken up, and dried, and after|wards &s;trewed on a red hot poker, or bar
<PB N="13" REF="12">of iron, flame and &s;parkle beautifully, into an infinite variety of colours, re&s;embling a peacock's tail, very elegantly illu&s;trating the formation of the variegated &s;cum &s;o frequently ob&s;erved on the &s;urface of many mineral waters, &s;ulphureous as well as chalybeate.</P>
<P>A multiplicity of experiments have been made long &s;ince, on the Nottington Wa|ter, with mo&s;t of the various &s;ub&s;tances commonly made u&s;e of in inve&s;tigating the properties of mineral waters, tho&s;e which have been principally employed in this, were &s;olutions of &s;ilver, lead, copperas, and alum, lime water, &s;ea water, &s;oap, volatile alkalis mild and cau&s;tic, tincture and powder of galls, and &s;uch other a&s;tringents, &s;yrup of violets, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P>The&s;e experiments have been made by different per&s;ons at di&s;tinct periods of time, tho&s;e made by Godfry, were in the year 1719, tho&s;e by the late Dr. William Cuming, of Dorche&s;ter, in 1740, and tho&s;e by Dr. Rutty, nine years after|wards.</P>
<P>Repeated trials of a more recent date by others, as well as &s;everal very lately made by the writer of the&s;e &s;heets, all tend indi&s;putably to confirm the opinion uni|ver&s;ally received, and proved by all pre|ceding experiments, than this water is principally impregnated with &s;ulphur and the native alkaline &s;alt or natron with which almo&s;t all the mineral waters in France &s;o plentifully abound; and which many affirm to be the true nitre of the
<PB N="15" REF="14">antients.&mdash;This natron &s;ome are of opini|on bears a nearer affinity to &s;al ammoniac than to &s;altpetre &mdash; Dr. Leigh, calls it a &s;ea, and urinous &s;alt &mdash; The natron (or anatron) which is taken out of a lake of &s;tagnant water in the de&s;art of Nitria in Aegypt, is de&s;cribed by Pliny, as an alkaline &s;alt of a lixiviate ta&s;te and per|forated like a &s;ponge.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing any mineral water it may be perhaps expected by &s;ome, that a very minute and &s;atisfactory enquiry, into its contents and natural appearances &s;hou'd not only be made; but its inherent virtues al&s;o be fully explained, by any writer who engages in a ta&s;k of this kind.</P>
<P>But &s;uch readers wou'd do well to bear in mind that this intricate &s;ubject
<PB N="16" REF="15">when every thing is duly con&s;idered, mu&s;t ever nece&s;&s;arily remain involved in much doubt, and ob&s;curity; and to re|collect that the learning of Short, the ac|curacy of Shaw, the &s;agacity of the ex|perimental Boyle, the ingenuity of the in|defatigable Hoffman, and the &s;ub&s;equent labours of other ingenious men of later days, have altogether contributed much le&s;s than cou'd be wi&s;hed to remove the veil thrown over the&s;e arcana of nature.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but that the greater part of mineral waters mo&s;t a&s;&s;ur|edly contain certain inherent principles, from which their virtues derive their &s;ource re&s;pectively, which are not to be a&s;cer|tained by any experiments whatever; they are placed infinitely too far beyond our
<PB N="17" REF="16">reach, the imperfection of human nature utterly precluding us from the power of con&s;idering them as the objects of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus for in&s;tance, with re&s;pect to the inherent &s;pecific properties of the Not|ington Water now under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Who is able to a&s;certain po&s;itively to which particular quality of it, its ac|knowledged healing virtue is indebted&mdash; Is it owing to its &s;ulphureous acid? to its alkaline &s;alt? to a due combination of both, co-exi&s;ting in this &s;alutary &s;pring? or perhaps after all, to &s;ome active princi|ple in the elementary water it&s;elf, not cognizable by the organs of our &s;en&s;es, rather than to any of its di&s;tinct proper|ties which can be rendered the immediate object of them by any chemical analy&s;is.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<P>Almo&s;t every body very readily ad|mits, and that with all due applau&s;e, that very great di&s;coveries and u&s;eful improve|ments are continually making in analy&s;ing mineral waters, that the means of doing it to greater advantage are much facilita|ted by the labour, an ingenuity, of mo|dern chymi&s;ts, as well as of many curious naturali&s;ts&mdash;That enquiries of this nature, afford an almo&s;t inexhau&s;tible fund of rational entertainment to &s;peculative men fond of &s;uch re&s;earches, who &s;hou'd by no means be di&s;couraged in following their favourite recreations at once &s;o amu|&s;ing, and in&s;tructing&mdash;But with regard to medical practitioners the ca&s;e is very dif|ferent, to whom &s;ome bounds ought to be &s;et to the time employed in &s;uch lucubrations.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P><HI>"E&s;t modus in rebus &s;unt certi denique Fines"</HI> it is their more immediate pro|vince, to attend to the good effects of mineral waters, making &s;uch u&s;e of their known properties, as may be&s;t tend to promote the art of healing di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from thus em|ploying their time, and talents, will prove the be&s;t con&s;olation for their &s;elf-denial in foregoing re&s;earches, more curious, than u&s;eful, when carried too far by tho&s;e on whom the public have a powerful and ju&s;t claim, for a larger portion of their time, than they otherwi&s;e leave it in their power to afford, to &s;uch as &s;tand in need of their con&s;tant daily attendance.</P>
<P>It may therefore perhaps be deemed &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e of this &s;mall tract,
<PB N="20" REF="19">which is written principally to recommend the known qualities of this Water, to re|peat once for all, that the predominant minerals which impregnate the Nottington &s;pring are &s;ulphur, and a native alkaline &s;alt&mdash;That alkalis, and acids, co-exi&s;t in it in &s;uch a manner as to form the peculiar combination: which contributes altoge|ther to give this celebrated &s;pring healing qualities, which (under due management) may be rendered of great benefit to man|kind in various di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Dr. Rutty in his &s;ynop&s;is of mineral waters places this &s;pring in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of nitro-&s;ulphureous waters, and as the virtue and &s;ingular utility of the&s;e com|binations in medicine are acknowledged on all hands, it is earne&s;tly recommended
<PB N="21" REF="20">to phy&s;icians, by this learned writer, to &s;earch their re&s;pective neighbourhoods in order to increa&s;e the catalogue of &s;uch medicinal &s;prings, as an object of much importance to the community.</P>
<P>If at the &s;ame time it was generally better under&s;tood, that they were ready to take the pains of regi&s;tering the cures performed by the waters in their vicinity, &s;uch communications would probably be made to them from time to time, by many who derive material benefit from their u&s;e, as would furni&s;h u&s;eful hi&s;to|ries, by which the virtues of mineral waters would be better a&s;certained, their reputation con&s;equently advanced, and a more general u&s;e made of them for the good of all tho&s;e afflicted with
<PB N="22" REF="21">the complaints, which experience has proved them an effectual remedy for.</P>
<P>That this may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be brought about with re&s;pect to the Not|tington Water, is the principal induce|ment the writer has for intruding a &s;econd time into the clo&s;et of the reader.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE VIRTUES OF THE NOTTINGTON WATER,</HEAD>
<P>THIS Water has long been de&s;er|vedly famous for its great efficacy in curing various di&s;ea&s;es, more particular|ly tho&s;e of the &s;kin, which it radically effects, removing all eruptions and foul|ne&s;&s;es of it both by the internal and external u&s;e of the &s;pring duely per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>It mo&s;t admirably tempers ebullitions of the blood; it is clean&s;ing, cooling, and yet penetrating, few mineral waters perhaps equal it in attenuating gro&s;s humours of the habit, by means of its
<PB N="24" REF="23">&s;ubtle, penetrating, &s;ulphureous, &s;pirit it pervades the minute&s;t ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In impaired dige&s;tion with lo&s;s of ap|petite (whether from too free living or otherwi&s;e) attended with great debility, experience has proved it of &s;ingular u&s;e, in &s;trengthning the dige&s;tive powers of the &s;tomach, and re&s;toring the tone of its fibres.</P>
<P>It helps to remove effectually ob&s;truct|ions of the liver, &s;pleen, and other vi|&s;cera: it relieves grievous head achs, and has been remarkably u&s;eful in curing the excruciating pains of the cramp.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;uitable remedies adapted to the occa&s;ion, it has been known to cure a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate jaundice of long &s;tanding; and in &s;lighter attacks of that complaint, its &s;ucce&s;s has been very frequent.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="24">
<P>It entirely de&s;troys the different &s;pecies of worms which infe&s;t the human body, and with le&s;s trouble and inconvenience, than the u&s;e of many other anthelmintics occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the gravel this water is drank to very great advantage to the &s;ufferer. as it &s;carcely ever fails in promoting the di&s;charge of &s;and in con&s;iderable quan|tities, when it is per&s;evered in for &s;ome time; it clears the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, and has been &s;erviceable in &s;ome ca&s;es, which were looked upon as ulcerations of the kidnies from the attendant &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>In weakne&s;&s;es of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, where the patient is low and quite di&s;|pirited, this Water has the happie&s;t effects, e&s;pecially in &s;ome particular
<PB N="26" REF="25">habits of a &s;corbutic tendency, with dejection, lo&s;s of &s;trength and appetite, not unfrequently accompanied with blot|ches, &s;pots, and other eruptive appear|ances of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>U&s;ed externally, and internally by per&s;ons of corpulent habits, who become unweildy &s;uddenly, the Nottington Wa|ter is &s;erviceable in reducing them to a more &s;alutary &s;tandard, removing &s;pon|taneous la&s;&s;itude, and checking this inju|rious tendency to a too rapid corpulency.</P>
<P>In an incontinence of urine this Water will alleviate the complaint, and will probably be found to effect much more, when trials are made of it more frequent|ly, by tho&s;e who have the misfortune to be afflicted with this trouble&s;ome, and hitherto incurable di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="26">
<P>But in nothing, has the peculiar pro|perty of this Water in correcting the vitiated juices of the body, been more manife&s;tly &s;een; than in the healing of old wounds, which a &s;corbutic taint, or depraved humours of the habit, had occa&s;ioned to break out afre&s;h, and in ulcers which from &s;imilar cau&s;es, either were never fairly healed up, or if they were &s;o pronounced, were exceedingly apt to break out again from time to time, on any great change of the con&s;titution of the air; or in the diet of the per&s;on di&s;ea&s;ed, from any violent fatigue under|gone, or from any exce&s;s unguardedly committed.</P>
<P>A remarkable recent ca&s;e of the kind under con&s;ideration lately occurred, in
<PB N="28" REF="27">which the &s;uperior efficacy of the Not|tington Water, over many other mineral waters in the kingdom, was fairly proved by a re&s;pectable gentleman; in healing up a wound of long &s;tanding, which had baffled every attempt made to effect a cure by the waters at &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent places of re&s;ort; and which he had di&s;paired of ever finding that relief for, which he has now happily obtained, by per&s;evering &s;ome time in the external and internal u&s;e of this healing &s;pring, which has given him (as it were) a new con&s;titution, and repaired the injuries his habit had &s;u&s;tained by re&s;iding in hot climates.</P>
<P>In &s;ome kinds of ery&s;ipelas, drinking this Water has been recommended with
<PB N="29" REF="28">&s;ucce&s;s, but the efficacy of the external application of it &s;eems rather equivocal; and indeed in this di&s;ea&s;e &s;ew outward applications are admi&s;&s;ible with &s;afety&mdash;dry meal applied to the parts affected is perhaps one of the be&s;t, as well as the &s;afe&s;t topies.</P>
<P>In &s;trumous inflammations of the eyes, the u&s;e of this Water may be per&s;evered in both externally and internally, till a cure is effected, which it eventually brings about, in a &s;horter &s;pace of time, than almo&s;t any other remedy, and with greater &s;ecurity again&s;t relap&s;es.</P>
<P>It has been the cu&s;tom with the inha|bitants of this neighbourhood (for time immemorial) to drink this Water chief|ly about the month of march, before the
<PB N="30" REF="29">&s;pring rains fall, when they look upon the Water as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing its greate&s;t degree of &s;trength. &mdash; But the company who frequent Weymouth in the &s;ea&s;on for &s;ea bathing, from july to october inclu&s;ive, drink this Water in dry &s;ea&s;ons to great advantage,&mdash;For want of proper conveni|ence this &s;pring has not been made u&s;e of externally for a con&s;iderable time pa&s;t &s;o much as it is to be hoped it will be in future, when &s;ome propo&s;ed improve|ments for that purpo&s;e have taken place.</P>
<P>By bathing, the Water is taken into the habit by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, and carried through the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, this would be &s;till more effectually pro|moted by making u&s;e of it warm.</P>
<P>A warm bath of the Nottington Water,
<PB N="31" REF="30">analogy leaves us little or no room to doubt, will be found at lea&s;t equal to that of Harrowgate in curing hard tumors, paralytic pains, ulcers, &s;crophulous com|plaints, brui&s;es, &s;trains, lamene&s;s, and weakne&s;s. &mdash; In mo&s;t colical complaints in general, in nephritic colics, and even in nervous hy&s;teric colics, (with proper management in other re&s;pects) it will be found a mo&s;t u&s;eful remedy.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not however be denied that there are certain particular circum&s;tan|ces, under which the indi&s;criminate u&s;e of this Water would be prejudicial. &mdash; It is deemed improper for per&s;ons under an hectic &s;ever, and is equally &s;o for tho&s;e who have tubercles of their lungs, and &s;ome contingent circum&s;tances may
<PB N="32" REF="31">ari&s;e during a cour&s;e of it, which may for a time render it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;i&s;t both from its external, and internal u&s;e, till &s;uch ob&s;tacles are removed; it is therefore proper in the u&s;e of this, as well as in other mineral waters, that it &s;hould be <HI>"Arte data."</HI></P>
<P>There are however fewer exceptions to the general u&s;e of this &s;pring, than to mo&s;t other mineral waters, and con&s;e|quently le&s;s danger to be incurred, from an indi&s;criminate u&s;e of it by tho&s;e who are obliged to have recour&s;e to it without the benefit of advice.</P>
<P>Some people to whom the u&s;e of the Nottington Water has been enjoined, have been recommended to take an eme|tic, and &s;ome mild purgative before they entered on a cour&s;e of the Water.</P>

<P>The&s;e &s;teps may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes, where there is a nau&s;ea at the &s;tomach, or where the particular &s;tate of the bowels, may require their being previou&s;ly clean&s;ed&mdash;and to &s;cro|phulous patients more particularly, &s;uch evacuations are exceedingly u&s;eful pri|or to drinking and bathing.</P>
<P>Otherwi&s;e in general, as this Water pa&s;&s;es very readily off for the mo&s;t part by the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, and keep the body moderately open; it is &s;eldom very nece&s;&s;ary, to make u&s;e of any previous evacuations,</P>
<P>When indeed the natural di&s;charges do not properly occur, as they ought; both purgatives and diuretic medicines &s;hould be exhibited; by the u&s;e of which
<PB N="34" REF="33">properly managed, the Water has &s;hort|ly after its u&s;ual good effects.</P>
<P>When the Water is detained at any time rather too long in the habit, nothing facilitates the operation of diuretics and contributes to keep off feveri&s;h heat from the &s;y&s;tem, more than an occa|&s;ional u&s;e of the lancet.</P>
<P>Moderate exerci&s;e is advi&s;eable dur|ing a cour&s;e of this Water, and riding &s;eems the mo&s;t eligible way of taking it.</P>
<P>No very &s;trict diet is enjoined in ordi|nary ca&s;es, &s;alted meat however, fi&s;h and eggs, &s;hould not be eaten.</P>
<P>It is a circum&s;tance which never can be &s;ufficiently regretted, that hi&s;tor|ries of cures effected by the Nottington Water from time to time, have never
<PB N="35" REF="34">been authenticated, in a manner to en|gage the attention of the public in gen|eral, or that of the afflicted in particular, labouring under complaints which it is &s;o effectual a remedy for; no regi&s;ter of cures performed, having been pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Although the writer of the&s;e &s;heets has had ample information, and &s;ome per&s;onal experience of the undoubted efficacy of this &s;pring in various di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o as to warrant his recommending the u&s;e of it in private practice, he is aware that to re&s;t the reputation of it on his bare a&s;&s;er|tion would be a mo&s;t unbecoming pre|&s;umption in him; it is with a view to procure a &s;eries of well atte&s;ted hi&s;tories of cures in future, that he undertakes an office, (he would be better plea&s;ed to &s;ee
<PB N="36" REF="35">placed in abler hands) of dige&s;ting the communications he may receive through a channel (judged to be as little excepti|onable as po&s;&s;ible) of cures effected from time to time, with &s;uch ob&s;ervations on tho&s;e which fall under his own immediate in&s;pection, as may tend to promote this undertaking, which has for its object, the rendering of this mineral Water of more general u&s;e.</P>
<P>Had a plan of this kind been adopted many years ago, the public would have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a li&s;t of cures as would have removed every doubt of the wonderful efficacy of this healing &s;pring, and it would not have been nece&s;&s;ary at this time to have recalled the attention of the public to this medical &s;pring by
<PB N="37" REF="36">celebrating its due prai&s;es de novo.</P>
<P>The Well has been of late in a very bad condition from neglect, and will continue le&s;s u&s;eful to the public, till proper &s;teps are taken to put it in order.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious method to put an effectual &s;top to the uncleanly abu&s;es &s;o long and ju&s;tly complained of, will be to have it properly covered in, and a pump erected; that tho&s;e who drink the Water, may have it in the utmo&s;t purity.</P>
<P>A &s;tone ci&s;tern &s;unk at a proper di&s;|tance to receive the wa&s;te water, con|veyed by a trough, will &s;erve as a pro|per re&s;ervoir, for the purpo&s;e of wa&s;hing di&s;ea&s;ed animals.&mdash;The abhorred idea of their being dipped in the Well, has deterred many people from u&s;ing the
<PB N="38" REF="37">Water, and common decency requires, that &s;uch loath&s;ome objects &s;hould be kept from the &s;ight of tho&s;e, who repair to the Well, to drink the Water.</P>
<P>The expedient at pre&s;ent made u&s;e of, to purify the &s;pring after the&s;e pollutions, by an opening made in the &s;ide of the well, level with the &s;urface of the ground; to clear it of the foul water, is attended with a particular inconvenience.&mdash;The adjoining rivulet, not unfrequently flows freely through the opening into the well, which nece&s;&s;arily lowers the &s;trength of the mineral water, and con&s;equently di|mini&s;hes its medicinal virtues, more or le&s;s, in proportion as the flood prevails.</P>
<P>The approach to the &s;pring is at pre|&s;ent extremely inconvenient, it affords
<PB N="39" REF="38">no &s;helter in bad weather to tho&s;e who frequent it, and many other awkward cir|cum&s;tances attend its pre&s;ent &s;tate, which all who have occa&s;ion to vi&s;it it complain of, and wi&s;h to &s;ee remedied.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the writer of this tract, had it in contemplation to &s;ubmit to the public a plan to render the &s;pring of more gene|ral u&s;e, by propo&s;ing the mo&s;t obvious means to remove the ob&s;tacles to this de&s;ireable end.&mdash;He did him&s;elf the hon|our to communicate his de&s;ign to &s;ome gentlemen of fortune, who&s;e property near the &s;pring gave them a right to com|mand this attention from him.&mdash;Two of the&s;e gentlemen were mutually di&s;po&s;ed to remedy the defects complained of, at their own private expence; which rendered
<PB N="40" REF="39">any application to the public from the writer on the plan he had propo&s;ed, not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but under the&s;e circum|&s;tances improper.</P>
<P>The lord of the hundred al&s;o did him the honour to &s;ignify by letter, his a&s;&s;ent to any improvements to be made at the Well by which the public were to be be|nefited; it not only was a mark of re|&s;pect due to the&s;e gentlemen, to lay before them the intended repairs nece&s;&s;ary to be made to pre&s;erve the Water, but there were local circum&s;tances with re|&s;pect to the right of its property, which rendered it incumbent on him to act with becoming attention to each of the gentlemen, without pre&s;uming to un|der&s;tand the validity of either of their
<PB N="41" REF="40">claims, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which by no means belonged to him to enter into.</P>
<P>If the writer's plan of fitting up the Well by public contribution had been ad|vi&s;eable, it was recommended to have a pump room erected of a circular form; the pump to have been in the center, with a circular &s;tone &s;eat round the in&s;ide wall, to have had a proper ci&s;tern with a trough or channel to convey the wa&s;te water to a re&s;ervoir at a convenient di&s;tance for ex|ternal u&s;e&mdash;It was intended to &s;upply the pump room with gla&s;&s;es, for the conveni|ence of tho&s;e who drink the Water, and a key, or keys, were to be lodged at one of the adjacent hou&s;es, to be delivered from time to time, to all who called for them for acce&s;s to the pump, and &s;ome other
<PB N="42" REF="41">conveniencies were intended for the better accommodation of the public.</P>
<P>All per&s;ons who derive any material benefit by the u&s;e of the Nottington Wa|ter, are reque&s;ted earne&s;tly to leave an ac|count of their re&s;pective ca&s;es in the hands of Mr. Delamotte, at his Library in St. Thomas's Street, Weymouth; who is to collect the hi&s;tories of cures per&s;ormed by it&mdash;By the&s;e communications, an op|portunity will be afforded of a&s;certaining the virtues of the water more fully than has been done hitherto; of extending its reputation, and bringing it into more general u&s;e; which it is pre&s;umed will eventually be found equal to the waters of Harrowgate or Cheltenham, in the cure of various maladies, more particularly
<PB N="43" REF="42">&s;corbutic, &s;crophulous, and cutancous di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Since the&s;e &s;heets went to the pre&s;s, the Well has been properly clean&s;ed, a &s;tone wall has been built round it, and by the &s;ame benevolent hand, if the writer is not mi&s;informed, it is further intend|ed to convey the water by a trough to a ci&s;tern for external u&s;e.&mdash;Though the plan on which this has been conducted, falls rather &s;hort, of what it is hoped will be hereafter effected; it &s;till redounds much to the credit of this di&s;intere&s;ted benefactor to the public, who does not aim at e&s;tabli&s;hing any claim whatever to the property of the well, by what he has already done, or means further to do; his &s;ole motive being to render this
<PB N="44" REF="43">mineral Water of more general u&s;e, by removing the nui&s;ances complained of; that all who drink it, may partake of it in its pure&s;t &s;tate.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means this Well fallen in &s;ome mea&s;ure of late into di&s;u&s;e, but never in|to the lea&s;t di&s;credit as to its medicinal virtues, will flouri&s;h with renewed and augmented &s;plendor, and prove hereafter u&s;eful to thou&s;ands yet unborn; by the divine help, without which the virtues of mineral &s;prings are of no avail.</P>
