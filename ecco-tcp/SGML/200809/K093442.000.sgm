<L>You &s;tand convicted, Sir&mdash;for you excel:</L>
<L>That deadly Crime <HI>De&s;ert</HI> mu&s;t &s;till endure&mdash;</L>
<L>Your Morals cen&s;ur'd &s;hall your Fame &s;ecure.</L>
<L>Your Morals too!&mdash;is that their de&s;p'rate Aim?</L>
<L>What CA'NDISH loves&mdash;nor noble BOYLE can blame&mdash;</L>
<L>That aweful Cen&s;or both of Books and Men,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Life's as faultle&s;s as his learned Pen;</L>
<L>To Truth attach'd, from &s;ervile Byas free,</L>
<L>Wou'd &s;peak that Truth to Kings he &s;peaks to me.</L>
<L>His Heart ingenuous as the Source of Day,</L>
<L>Heedle&s;s what Madmen dream, or Dunces &s;ay;</L>
<L>Collected, in his con&s;cious Worth, withdraws,</L>
<L>And leaves, to Fools, the Squabble for Applau&s;e.</L>
<L>Go on, &s;till envy'd let your Foes &s;till gaze,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t <HI>Britain</HI> gives you Wealth, and <HI>Europe</HI> Prai&s;e;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="22">Be &s;till applauded by the Wi&s;e and Great,</L>
<L>And make your Fortune, and your Fame, compleat:</L>
<L>Till &s;ated with Renown, in Life's Decline,</L>
<L>Amid the Mu&s;es Shades, retir'd, you &s;hine,</L>
<L>Shelter'd by Laurels, which your Worth has won,</L>
<L>Calm and &s;erene, like CIBBER's &s;etting Sun.</L>
