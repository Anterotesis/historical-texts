<HEAD>The LADY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A WORTHY Squire of &s;ober life,</L>
<L>Had a conceited boa&s;ting wi&s;e;</L>
<L>Of <HI>him</HI> &s;he daily made complaint,</L>
<L><HI>Her&s;elf</HI> &s;he thought a very &s;aint.</L>
<L>She lov'd to load mankind with blame,</L>
<L>And on their errors build her fame.</L>
<L>Her favourite &s;ubject of di&s;pute</L>
<L>Was Eve and the forbidden fruit.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">
"Had I been Eve," &s;he often cried,</L>
<L>"Man had not fall'n nor woman died;</L>
<L>"I &s;till had kept the orders given,</L>
<L>"Nor for an apple lo&s;t my heaven;</L>
<L>"To gratify my curious mind,</L>
<L>"I ne'er had ruin'd all mankind;</L>
<L>"Nor from a vain de&s;ire to know,</L>
<L>"Entail'd on all my race &s;uch woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Squire reply'd, "I fear 'tis true,</L>
<L>"The &s;ame ill &s;pirit lives in you:</L>
<L>"Tempted alike, I dare believe,</L>
<L>"You would have di&s;obey'd like Eve."</L>
<L>The lady &s;torm'd and &s;till deny'd</L>
<L>Both curio&s;ity and pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Squire &s;ome future day at dinner,</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to try this boa&s;tful &s;inner;</L>
<L>He griev'd &s;uch vanity po&s;&s;e&s;t her,</L>
<L>And thus in &s;erious terms addre&s;s'd her.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">
"Madam, the u&s;ual &s;plendid fea&s;t,</L>
<L>"With which our wedding day is grac'd,</L>
<L>"With you I mu&s;t not &s;hare to-day,</L>
<L>"For bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ummons me away.</L>
<L>"Of all the dainties on the table,</L>
<L>"Pray eat as long as you are able;</L>
<L>"Indulge in every co&s;tly di&s;h;</L>
<L>"Enjoy, 'tis what I really wi&s;h;</L>
<L>"Only ob&s;erve one prohibition,</L>
<L>"Nor think it a &s;evere condition;</L>
<L>"On one &s;mall di&s;h which cover'd &s;tands,</L>
<L>"You mu&s;t not dare to lay your hands;</L>
<L>"Go&mdash;di&s;obey not on your life,</L>
<L>"Or henceforth you're no more my wife."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The treat was &s;erv'd, the Squire was gone,</L>
<L>The murm'ring lady din'd alone:</L>
<L>She &s;aw whate'er could grace a fea&s;t,</L>
<L>Or charm the eye, or plea&s;e the ta&s;te.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
But while &s;he rang'd from this to that,</L>
<L>From ven'&s;on haunch to turtle fat;</L>
<L>On one &s;mall di&s;h &s;he chanc'd to light,</L>
<L>By a deep cover hid from &s;ight.</L>
<L>"Oh! here it is&mdash;yet not for me!</L>
<L>"I mu&s;t not ta&s;te, nay, dare not &s;ee.</L>
<L>"Why place it there? or why forbid</L>
<L>"That I &s;o much as lift the lid?</L>
<L>"Prohibited of this to eat,</L>
<L>"I care not for the &s;umptuous treat.</L>
<L>"I wonder if 'tis fowl or fi&s;h,</L>
<L>"To know what's there I merely wi&s;h.</L>
<L>"I'll look&mdash;O no, I lo&s;e for ever,</L>
<L>"If I'm betray'd my hu&s;band's favour.</L>
<L>"I own I think it va&s;tly hard,</L>
<L>"Nay, tyranny, to be debarr'd.</L>
<L>"John you may go&mdash;the wine's decanted</L>
<L>"I'll ring or call you when you're wanted."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<L>Now left alone, &s;he waits no longer,</L>
<L>Temptation pre&s;&s;es more and &s;tronger.</L>
<L>"I'll peep&mdash;the harm can ne'er be much,</L>
<L>"For tho' I peep I will not touch;</L>
<L>"Why I'm forbid to lift this cover</L>
<L>"One glance will tell, and then 'tis over.</L>
<L>"My hu&s;band's ab&s;ent, &s;o is John,</L>
<L>"My peeping never can be known."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Trembling, &s;he yielded to her wi&s;h,</L>
<L>And rais'd the cover from the di&s;h:</L>
<L>She &s;tarts&mdash;for lo! an open pye</L>
<L>From which &s;ix living &s;parrows fly.</L>
<L>She calls, &s;he &s;creams, with wild &s;urpri&s;e,</L>
<L>"Ha&s;te John and catch the&s;e birds," &s;he cries;</L>
<L>John hears not, but to crown her &s;hame,</L>
<L>In at her call, her hu&s;band came.</L>
<L>Sternly he frown'd as thus he &s;poke,</L>
<L>"Thus is your vow'd allegiance broke!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">
"Self-ign'rance led you to believe</L>
<L>"You did not &s;hare the &s;in of Eve.</L>
<L>"Like her's, how ble&s;t was your condition!</L>
<L>"How &s;mall my gentle prohibition!</L>
<L>"Yet you, tho' fed with every dainty,</L>
<L>"Sat pining in the mid&s;t of plenty.</L>
<L>"This di&s;h, thus &s;ingled from the re&s;t,</L>
<L>"Of your obedience was the te&s;t.</L>
<L>"Your mind, unbroke by &s;elf denial,</L>
<L>"Cou'd not &s;u&s;tain this &s;lender trial.</L>
<L>"Humility from hence be taught,</L>
<L>"Learn candour to another's fault;</L>
<L>"Go know, like Eve, from this &s;ad dinner,</L>
<L>"You're both a vain and curious &s;inner."</L>
