<L>TO plea&s;e the town is not a ta&s;k &s;evere,</L>
<L>Wit will command a &s;mile, di&s;tre&s;s a tear!</L>
<L>And he, who&s;e moral picture plainly &s;hews</L>
<L>The tree of vice can bear no fruit but woes!</L>
<L>That, tho' &s;ucce&s;sful long in fa&s;hion's reign,</L>
<L>The villain's wages are di&s;grace and pain;</L>
<L>But that the good, by bounty wi&s;ely given,</L>
<L>Can make this vale of tears re&s;emble heav'n!</L>
<L>With new-born comfort hu&s;h the widow's &s;igh,</L>
<L>And wipe the tear from pallid mi&s;'ry's eye!</L>
<L>The Bard, who thus employs his u&s;eful pen,</L>
<L>Imprints his drama on the hearts of men;</L>
<L>Commands re&s;pect from age, applau&s;e from youth,</L>
<L>And makes the &s;tage a&s;&s;i&s;t the CAUSE OF TRUTH.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, has an author many an anxious fear,</L>
<L>As his probationary night draws near:</L>
<L>When to his friends the manu&s;cript is read,</L>
<L>Each &s;ocial critic nods the approving head;</L>
<L>Mo&s;t yield him flatt'ry&mdash;&s;ome with jaundic'd eye</L>
<L>Glance at a fault, and at a beauty &s;igh.</L>
<L>But the&s;e are few&mdash;true genius &s;till delights</L>
<L>To gaze with rapture at the Mu&s;e's &s;lights!</L>
<L>And &s;corns to triumph at a brother's fall,</L>
<L>When Fame's wide dome is large enough for <HI>all!</HI></L>
<L>Tho' none &s;hall mount where Shak&s;peare &s;its &s;ublime&punc;</L>
<L>The drama's monarch to the end of time!</L>
<L>Within that fane they each a wreath may wear,</L>
<L>Which nature's darling offspring hallow'd there&mdash;</L>
<L>And &s;eated at the ba&s;e of Shak&s;peare's throne,</L>
<L>Feel &s;ome &s;mall portion of his fire their own!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, if they knew their int're&s;t, wits wou'd be</L>
<L>By friend&s;hip bound in one great family;</L>
<L>And, if de&s;erving, all might reap the bays</L>
<L>From the rich harve&s;t of the Public prai&s;e.</L>

<P>No. I know a little more of the cir|cum&s;tances than you do. Mr. Cleveland has a daughter.</P>

<P>Really!</P>

<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;Stating that as we were the neare&s;t, and only male relations he had, to us he has taken the liberty of con&s;igning his remittances&mdash;with directions how he wi&s;hes them to be inve&s;ted. Under&s;tanding that your re&s;idence in London was only ca&s;ual, and al&s;o thinking the trouble of bu&s;ine&s;s more &s;uited to my time of life, he thought it better to addre&s;s his letter to me. In it, he ex|plains all the particulars of his marriage; and recommends his wife and daughter to our at|tention.</P>

<P>How&mdash;are they not with him?</P>

<P>No. His daughter we may hourly ex|pect&mdash;Not being able to &s;ettle his affairs immedi|ately on the death of his father, he &s;ent her before him, unwilling to detain her from her mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, is the mother in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes;&mdash;and has been for &s;everal years. His marriage was without the con&s;ent of his father, and, for &s;ome time, unknown to him&mdash;Enraged when he di&s;covered it, he in&s;i&s;ted on a &s;eparation,&mdash;to avoid ruin, which would have been the con|&s;equence of his father's re&s;entment, he was forced to comply. The child was &s;uffered to remain with him&mdash;The wife was doom'd to return to England, where, for the&s;e fifteen years &s;he has lived in retirement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vi&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what is to be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are recommended, it &s;eems, to our attention; but, really, I don't well &s;ee how I can reconcile to my&s;elf, taking notice of, and introducing to my acquaintances, people, one doesn't know who&mdash;and that have been living one doesn't know where,</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you talk of? Are they not the

wife and daughter of a nabob? Your high-bred friends will wor&s;hip you for the introduction. Think what will be the magnificence of their hou&s;e, the &s;plendour of their equipage, the bril|liancy of their entertainments. Such &s;uppers as theirs will be the fa&s;hionable world would &s;cram|ble for a &s;eat at, even if they were given by a per&s;onage from a hotter place than Bengal.</P>

<P>Why, yes, Sir; yes. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that I am an old fellow that remember Mrs. Cleveland (Heaven ble&s;s her!) when &s;he was not the height of my knee. Often and often is the time that I have danced her o'top of it. Well, that is neither here nor there. When her father
<PB N="7" REF="10">
died&mdash;Ah! I &s;hall never forget it&mdash;he has not left a better man behind him&mdash;there was not a dry eye in the village except the undertaker's, and folks do &s;ay he cried a bit. Well, her father, good &s;oul! had met with &s;o many lo&s;&s;es and cro&s;&s;es, that there was little enough left for his daughter to live like a lady on; &s;o &s;he was per&s;uaded by her friends to take a voyage to India with a cou&s;in of her's, who had married, and was going to &s;ettle there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Cleveland has acquainted me with the re&s;t. There he married her, and from thence, by the &s;everity of his father, he was forced to &s;end her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oakw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, poor dear! home &s;he came again, mi&s;erable enough, to be &s;ure. Well, mayhap, all for the be&s;t; now &s;he will be as happy as the day is long. But for this many a year &s;he has led but a lone&s;ome &s;ort of a life; for you may think my dame and I, though we love her like a child of our own, can't have been company good enough for her: but &s;he was as kind to us, and made as much of us, as though we had been the be&s;t people in the land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>We &s;hall &s;oon, I hope, have the plea&s;ure of receiving her in this hou&s;e. She mu&s;t not think of &s;eeing any other habitation.</P>

That lends deformity re&s;i&s;tle&s;s grace,</L>
<L>O'erthrows the mighty, and exalts the ba&s;e;</L>
<L>Great &s;ub&s;titute for learning, genius, worth,</L>
<L>De&s;potic &s;overeign of adoring earth!</L>
<L>But let me check the ra&s;h injurious thought,</L>
<L>For, in this court, no verdict can be bought.</L>
<L>Here merit &s;afely may a&s;&s;ert her plea,</L>
<L>While candour regulates the mild decree;</L>
<L>And by that candour one who oft has try'd</L>
<L>Its gen'rous force, his fate mu&s;t now abide,</L>
<L>In hopes one error more will pardon find,</L>
<L>Since to his others you've &s;o long been kind.</L>
