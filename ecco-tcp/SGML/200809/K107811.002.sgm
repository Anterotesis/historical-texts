<P>THE following Poem does not pa&s;s any judgment upon the Pictures that are now exhibited in the Gallery; but attempts to point out new &s;ubjects for future Ex|hibitions: And, in the delineation of new &s;ubjects, attention is paid to the principle laid down by our late great Painter, (in his notes to the tran&s;lation of Fre&s;noy by Mr. MASON) <Q>That palpable &s;ituation is preferable to curious &s;entiment, as the Painter &s;peaks to the eye.</Q></P>

<P>I AM ambitious of in&s;cribing this Poem to you, as a &s;mall return for the warm commendation you be|&s;toed upon it, when the Poem was fir&s;t publi&s;hed.

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE materials that form the Fir&s;t Part of the following Poem are taken from the Scandinavian poetics, The EDDA! In the remarks on the third fable of the Edda, are the&s;e words, <Q>A powerful Being had with his breath animated the drops out of which the fir&s;t giant was formed. This Being, whom the Edda affects not to name, was entirely di&s;tinct from Odin, who had his birth long after the formation of the giant Ymir.</Q>&mdash;This fir&s;t agent, or Genius, whom the Edda affects not to name, is &s;uppo&s;ed, in the following Poem, to create, from his own immediate power, the &s;y&s;tem of the Scaldic mythology. As it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to introduce the whole &s;y&s;tem without running into a te|dious enumeration, the principal features of it are only re|tained, &s;ufficient (it is pre&s;umed) to give &s;ome idea of the character of the northern poetry. Among other omi&s;&s;ions, the reader will find that no mention is made of <HI>Giml&eacute;,</HI> the man&s;ion of bli&s;s, that was appropriated to the reception of the virtuous, nor of <HI>Na&s;trande,</HI> the abode of the impious; the&s;e places not being &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in their full extent till the general de&s;truction of the world; whereas the hall of Odin, and the caves of Hela, were peculiarly the Ely&s;ium and the Tartarus of the Runic poetry: they are perpetually referred to in the ancient &s;ongs of the Scalds, and the wild &s;y&s;tem of the&s;e contra&s;ted abodes &s;eems well calculated to encourage
<PB N="42" REF="43">that &s;pirit of war and enterprize which runs through the whole Scandinavian min&s;trel&s;y.</P>
<P>Some expre&s;&s;ions taken from the Edda may appear ob&s;cure without an explanation.&mdash;In the language of the Scalds, the world is &s;tiled the great ve&s;&s;el that floats on the ages.&mdash;The rainbow, the bridge of the gods.&mdash;To drink the blood of friend&s;hip, alludes to a ceremony performed by two warriors when they enter into an alliance of friend&s;hip; they made in|ci&s;ions in their arms or brea&s;t, and ta&s;ting each other's blood, they mutually &s;wore, that the death of the fir&s;t of them who fell in battle &s;hould not pa&s;s unrevenged.</P>
<P>To celebrate the ma&s;s of weapons, was to fight again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, who&s;e religious &s;entiments the Scandavians held in contempt, as thinking them adver&s;e to the &s;pirit of war.</P>
<P>The Valkeries are a female troop, whom Odin &s;ends to the field of battle upon invi&s;ible &s;teeds; their function is to choo&s;e &s;uch as are de&s;tined to &s;laughter, and conduct their &s;pirits to the Paradi&s;e of the Brave.</P>
<P>Fenris is a large wolf, who is to break his chains at the general conflagration, and to &s;wallow the &s;un.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Mona&s;tery of CLUNI, from whence ABELARD is &s;uppo&s;ed to write the following Epi&s;tle, was founded in the year 611, near the village of Ma&s;con, on the river Graone. The Head of this convent (in the time of ABELARD) was di&s;|tingui&s;hed for his learning and humanity. Hi&s;tory elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks, by the appellation of the Venerable PETER! He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD, when he was under the cen&s;ure of the court of Rome.</P>
<P>SAINT BERNARD al&s;o is connected with the &s;tory of Pa|raclete. This great man &s;tands eminently forward in the pic|ture of the twelfth century: Born with a mind too re&s;tle&s;s and enterpri&s;ing to be confined within the circle of mona&s;tic occupations, he ru&s;hed into the tumult of active life, and took the lead in &s;ome of the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions of that pe|riod. With an undi&s;ciplined ardour peculiar to his cha|racter, he precipitated his country into that ruinous mea&s;ure, the &s;econd cru&s;ade. Behold him at another time ha&s;tening to the conte&s;t that held all EUROPE in &s;u&s;pence, which ex|hibited two contending candidates for the popedom. The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpowered the pre|ten&s;ions of ANACLETUS, and INNOCENT was &s;eated on the papal throne. The enemies of this celebrated Abbot ne|ver impeached his moral character; but it mu&s;t be allowal
<PB N="74" REF="73">that in his zeal again&s;t the innovation of new opinions, he has &s;ometimes left unregarded the &s;uperior duty of charity. A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO, the pope's legate in France, contains the mo&s;t intolerant and &s;anguinary coun&s;el.</P>
<P>ABELARD in the following Epi&s;tle lays a con&s;iderable &s;tre&s;s upon his &s;entence of excommunication: In the dark ages, that &s;piritual humiliation was felt as the greate&s;t cala|mity; the relation, the parent, the lover, the friend, &s;u&s;pend|ed their endearing offices, and withdrew from the degraded offender.</P>
<P>THE following Poem has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by a beautiful &s;onnet, in&s;erted in a volume of Poems that does honour to mo|dera poetry, by Mr. Taylor, a gentleman who&s;e commenda|tion is a pa&s;&s;port to Fame, except where it is directed (as in the pre&s;ent intlance) by the amiable bias of friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>THIS Hi&s;torical Interlude is formed upon the plan that ROUSSEAU compo&s;ed his PYGMALION, which is a new &s;pe|cies of Dramatic Entertainment, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of a mono|logue, that is often &s;u&s;pended by the interpo&s;ition of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The following little Drama was written for (that ornament of the Stage) Mrs. POPE, who performed it on the night of her benefit. This Interlude has al&s;o been performed at BRAN|DENBURGH Hou&s;e: the part of MARGARET received from the theatrical abilities of her Serene Highne&s;s the Margravine the riche&s;t colouring and the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive truth of ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is taken from a remarkable incident in the life of MARGARET.&mdash;That unfortunate Queen, flying with her Son into a fore&s;t after the battle of HEXHAM, &s;aw a Robber approach with his naked &s;word; and finding that &s;he had no means of e&s;caping, &s;he &s;uddenly embraced the re&s;olution of tru&s;ting entirely for protection to his genero&s;ity. The man,

<L>THOU, to who&s;e &s;acred page the parting gue&s;t</L>
<L>Confides the workings of his grateful brea&s;t,</L>
<L>With awful plea&s;ure o'er thy form I bend,</L>
<L>My gift to bring&mdash;as brother, gue&s;t, and friend.</L>
<L>Farewell, ye &s;hades! (ah! not to fame unknown)</L>
<L>Where Elegance has rear'd her attic throne:</L>
<L>Who&s;e beauties, to the pure of ta&s;te addre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>In Nature's charms munificently dre&s;s'd;</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;oft amenity, with grace combin'd,</L>

<L>Ye &s;cenes o'er which I ca&s;t a ling'ring view,</L>
<L>O'er which affection breathes a warm adieu,</L>
<L>That hour I now recal with plea&s;ing pain,</L>
<L>Which gave your beauties to my wi&s;h again:</L>
<L>Yet then, as I approach'd your &s;miling &s;hore,</L>
<L>Prompt expectation gladly flew before:</L>
<L>Wing'd with gay hope, as nearer &s;till I drew,</L>
<L>Hills, plains, and woods a&s;&s;um'd a brighter hue:</L>
<L>Soft-wreath'd in lilac ve&s;tment, laughing May</L>
<L>With hailing a&s;pect met me on the way;</L>
<L>The various vale with eager &s;teps I pre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Prai&s;e on my tongue, and tran&s;port in my brea&s;t:</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="157">O'er each lov'd &s;pot I &s;ent a fond &s;urvey,</L>
<L>Where in the morn of life I wont to &s;tray;</L>
<L>The winding walks by memory endear'd,</L>
<L>Where with the growing plants my youth was rear'd,</L>
<L>Embow'ring &s;hades, in who&s;e deep gloom immers'd,</L>
<L>Reflection fed me, and the Mu&s;es nurs'd,</L>

<L>Yet, Album, ere the willing ta&s;k I leave,</L>
<L>Warm rom the heart the&s;e clo&s;ing lines receive,</L>
<L>'Twas at the hour to contemplation due,</L>
<L>When evening meekly from the world withdrew,</L>
<L>Beneath an aged oak, in pen&s;ive mood,</L>
<L>I Sorrow's &s;olitary captive &s;tood:</L>
<L>When, from the rifted trunk's ob&s;cure rece&s;s,</L>
<L>A voice breath'd forth, in accents of di&s;tre&s;s;</L>
<L>"Where! where is &s;he! of mild and rev'rend mien,</L>
<L>"Once the lov'd mi&s;tre&s;s of this &s;ylvan &s;cene?"&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="160" REF="158">"Fall'n&mdash;fall'n&mdash;fall'n&mdash;fall'n!"&mdash;a di&s;tant voice replied:</L>
<L>The branches &s;hook, as if to &s;en&s;e allied:</L>
<L>Wild Terror flung his &s;trong enchantment round,</L>
<L>And evening hurried into night profound!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now fond remembrance turns a willing &s;ight,</L>
<L>To dwell on gayer &s;cenes of pa&s;t delight,</L>
<L>Pleas'd to behold her, mid&s;t the poli&s;h'd train,</L>
<L>With grace, with dignity, her part &s;u&s;tain.</L>
<L>To mild fe&s;tivity by nature prone,</L>
<L>With inbred wit peculiarly her own,</L>
<L>Prompt ev'ry &s;portive incident to &s;eize,</L>
<L>Diffu&s;ing plea&s;ure with a carele&s;s ca&s;e;</L>
<L>Of pow'r to charm invincibly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Unfelt &s;he glided into every brea&s;t.</L>
<L>There are, who, fram'd with an enlighten'd ta&s;te,</L>
<L>High on the critic form by judgment plac'd,</L>
<L>Who (marking well her &s;en&s;e with &s;trength combin'd,</L>
<L>The &s;cintillations of her playful mind,</L>
<L><PB N="161" REF="159">An aptitude that never lo&s;t its aim)</L>
<L>With brilliant SEVIGNE' inwreathe her name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To di&s;content, the vice of age, unknown,</L>
<L>Her chearfulne&s;s maintain'd its envied throne:</L>
<L>The gay, the old, the learned, and the young,</L>
<L>And they who&s;e heart pure elegance had &s;trung,</L>
<L>By the &s;oft pow'r of her enchantment won,</L>
<L>Would oft the glare of throng'd a&s;&s;emblies &s;hun,</L>
<L>To court her ready wit's enliv'ning beam,</L>
<L>And ba&s;k beneath its undulating gleam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet oft from the&s;e unnotic'd would &s;he &s;teal,</L>
<L>To &s;oothe the bed-rid &s;tretch'd on Torture's wheel,</L>
<L>To &s;moothe the furrow on Misfortune's brown,</L>
<L>To warm the timid, and exalt the low;</L>
<L>With lenient hand admini&s;ter relief,</L>
<L>And clo&s;e the bleeding artery of grief.</L>

<PB N="162" REF="160">
<L>Ah, ever dear! ah, venerable Shade!</L>
