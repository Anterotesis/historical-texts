<P>IT is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould entertain a more humble opinion of the following little Production, than &s;he who pre&s;ents it to you. It is a trifle which, &s;he confe&s;&s;es, has but a very &s;lender claim to your protection; but &s;he con&s;iders that your Name will be an ornament to her Book, as your Friend&s;hip has been an ho|nour to its Author.</P>
<P>Where merit is inconte&s;tible, and cha|racters are decided by the concurring &s;uf|frage of mankind, prai&s;e becomes almo&s;t impertinent. It is ab&s;urd to be indu&s;trious in proving truths &s;o &s;elf-evident, that no one ever thought of controverting them.</P>
<P>I may be accu&s;ed of advancing a &s;tart|ling propo&s;ition, when I declare that you are an enemy to the Mu&s;es; but if it be allowed that de&s;cription and invention are

the very &s;oul of Poetry, I &s;hall be ju&s;tified by the world in general, who con&s;tantly behold you di&s;playing talents which cannot be de&s;cribed, and exhibiting excellencies which leave nothing to be imagined.</P>

<LG>
<L>There was a young, and valiant Knight,</L>
<L>SIR ELDRED was his name,</L>
<L>And never did a worthier wight</L>
<L>The rank of knighthood claim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where gliding <HI>Tay</HI> her &s;tream &s;ends forth,</L>
<L>To crown the neighbouring wood,</L>
<L>The antient glory of the North,</L>
<L>SIR ELDRED's ca&s;tle &s;tood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth was rich as youth might be</L>
<L>In patrimonial dower;</L>
<L>And many a noble feat had he</L>
<L>Atchiev'd, in hall, and bower.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He did not think, as &s;ome have thought,</L>
<L>Whom honour never crown'd,</L>
<L>The fame a father dearly bought,</L>
<L>Cou'd make the &s;on renown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<L>He better thought, a noble &s;ire,</L>
<L>Who gallant deeds had done,</L>
<L>To deeds of hardihood &s;hou'd fire</L>
<L>A brave and gallant &s;on.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The faire&s;t ance&s;try on earth</L>
<L>Without de&s;ert is poor;</L>
<L>And every deed of lofty worth</L>
<L>Is but a tax for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SIR ELDRED's heart was good and kind,</L>
<L>Alive to Pity's call;</L>
<L>A croud of virtues grac'd his mind,</L>
<L>He lov'd, and felt for all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>merit</HI> rais'd the &s;ufrerer's name,</L>
<L>He <HI>doubly</HI> &s;erv'd him <HI>then;</HI></L>
<L>And tho&s;e who cou'd not prove that claim,</L>
<L>He thought they &s;till were <HI>men.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But &s;acred truth the Mu&s;e compels</L>
<L>His errors to impart;</L>
<L>And yet the Mu&s;e, reluctant, tells</L>
<L>The fault of ELDRED's heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' kind and gentle as the dove,</L>
<L>As free from guile and art,</L>
<L>And mild, and &s;oft as infant love</L>
<L>The feelings of his heart;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if di&s;tru&s;t his thoughts engage,</L>
<L>Or jealou&s;y in&s;pires,</L>
<L>His bo&s;om wild and boundle&s;s rage</L>
<L>Inflames with all its fires:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not Thule's waves &s;o wildly break</L>
<L>To drown the northern &s;hore;</L>
<L>Not Etna's entrails fiercer &s;hake,</L>
<L>Or Scythia's tempe&s;ts roar.</L>

<L>That done&mdash;he left his woodland glade,</L>
