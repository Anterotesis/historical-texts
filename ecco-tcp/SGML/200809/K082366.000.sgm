<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>_COME, Come, Mr. <HI>Toby,</HI> Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides</HI> offers very fair; and if you don't come to an Accommoda|tion, what will the World &s;ay of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell not me of Offers, Accommoda|tion, and the World: I &s;ay po&s;itively I will not hear of any Reconciliation, till he &s;hall make me &s;uch Propo&s;als as may agree with my Safety and Honour. And therefore I do in&s;i&s;t that Fort <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> be demoli&s;h'd, and that, for our Security during the Negotiation, it be put into the Hands of the Sieurs <HI>Tooke</HI> and <HI>Barber:</HI> And if he refu&s;e to do this, I am de|termin'd <HI>to hold it out, and fight it to the la&s;t.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid.

<P>But Sir, con&s;ider a little. You began this Paper-War with no other View but &s;up|porting the Ballance of Pamphleteering; and you have now, as is evident, reduc'd old
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<HI>Iron&s;ides</HI> to &s;o low a Condition, that perhaps he may be glad upon any rea&s;onable Terms, to put an End to this long and bloody War: yet, Sir, whether his Pen is &s;o far &s;ubdued, whether it be <HI>wrought by ill Succe&s;s to &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Cat.</NOTE> is what I mightily doubt of. Con&s;ider, Sir, I be&s;eech you, what a deal of Money that &s;trong Fort has co&s;t him; how he has perpetually annoy'd you from that Coa&s;t, and&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you may talk till Doom&s;day if you plea&s;e; but I &s;hall make you no other Reply than Fort <HI>Ad&mdash;&s;on,</HI> Fort <HI>Ad&mdash;&s;on.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>All this is</HI> tow'ring <HI>Frenzy and Di&s;tra|ction;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Cat.</NOTE> and you talk as if you were &s;ure of holding Fortune by the Forelock, and of go|ing down to the Grave with the Reputation you have now e&s;tabli&s;h'd, whereas there is nothing &s;o difficult and uncertain; Of this, the Per&s;on you now &s;o much de&s;pi&s;e is a fre&s;h In&s;tance. How did the Force of his Pen in a few Months over-run your whole Country? Did he not in three Weeks time take the &s;trong Towns of <HI>Fenwick</HI> and <HI>Cocoa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Politick Coffee-Hou&s;es u|&s;ed by the Tories and where Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides</HI> us'd to go formerly and di&s;|pute.</NOTE> with many others. Did he not attempt to force the <HI>Examiner,</HI> that brave and experienc'd General, out of his Lines; and was he not very near effecting it? This &s;hould learn you, Sir, &s;ome Humility, and to put an end to your extravagant Way of Talking. Be|&s;ides, Remember, Sir,<Q><L>We took up Pens, not to revenge our &s;elves,</L>
<L>But free the Common-wealth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Cat.</NOTE></L></Q>

<P>When Fort <HI>A&mdash;&s;on</HI> is once in my Hands, I will then &s;end him &s;ome Propo&s;als, which I think fit to make him &s;ub&s;cribe as <HI>Prelimi|naries</HI> to our Treaty. As Fir&s;t, Sir.</P>

<P>Take him for, why for one of Mr. <HI>Con|greve</HI>'s odd Fellows, with a great deal of your little &s;ort of Wit, or if you plea&s;e to let me give you his Character plainer, for one who vainly imagines to become, from a Bankrupt in Poetry, a Haberda&s;her in Politicks; or if this wont do, I am &s;ure he's like one of tho&s;e Wi&s;e Men who laugh at a Fool's Advice, which, God knows, is &s;ometimes as fit to be follow'd, as that of a Wit's.</P>

<P>Ay! How came you by it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, by a Riot, which I very un|fortunately fell into at my coming out of his Hou&s;e: For you mu&s;t know, the Street where he lives is very far gone from the Doctrine he perpetually harrangues them with; and 'tis ten to one if you pa&s;s it with|out meeting with &s;ome publick &s;pirited Cob|ler or Taylor, who very in&s;olently will give you a Ju&s;tle into the Kennel, &s;hou'd you offer at a Que&s;tion, he immediately tells you, 'tis his Duty, calls you <HI>Tory,</HI> damns you for a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and &s;o goes about his Bu|&s;ine&s;s. Nay, even the Con&s;tables of his Pa|ri&s;h have drunk &s;o deep of his Cup, that they make no &s;cruple to declare to you, that, as they are Con&s;tables they are <HI>accountable</HI> to no Man; but that all <HI>England</HI> is <HI>account|able</HI> to them; and this they will tell you with an Air of In&s;olence. All which is to go for nothing, becau&s;e for&s;ooth at the End they cry, <HI>God ble&s;s the Hou&s;e of</HI> Hanover; as if it were impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay &s;o, without being impertinent, &s;awcy and trouble&s;ome, and &s;omewhat el&s;e which de&s;erves a wor&s;e Name. And now I know where Mr. <HI>Iron|&s;ides</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="13">
had his <HI>accountable</HI> and <HI>unaccountable.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I tell you the Con&s;table had it of Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides,</HI> and not Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides</HI> of the Con&s;table; tho' the Con&s;table indeed is one that under&s;tands publick Affairs very well. Be&s;ides, Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides</HI> does not ab&s;olutely &s;ay, that he is not accountable to any body what&s;oever, but that he is not accountable &s;o far as he is a Member of Parliament, or rather &s;o long as he &s;hall be. Out of that Capacity he well knows <HI>he is accountable,</HI> how much, and to whom, and that as &s;oon as he &s;hall cea&s;e to be the Repre&s;en|tative of <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and how &s;oon that will happen, God knows.

<P>Well, I'll take care and di&s;tingui&s;h. You &s;ee however the Con&s;table will have no Re&s;erve. But tell me, Mr. <HI>Toby,</HI> for you are a very generous Enemy, will you not have &s;ome Pity, when that Day &s;hall come?</P>

<P>Why the Day of Accounts.&mdash;Poor Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides!</HI> how will he then wi&s;h his publick Spirit had been le&s;s, and his private Oeconomy more; That he had never heard of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> That he had never known the Importance of it. And&mdash;</P>

<P>What is not every Man free to &s;et up for a Politician, e&s;pecially when he is &s;ure of his own Sufficiency, and has all the Rea&s;on in the World to be under <HI>Horrible Expectations.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Politician! yes, provided it be in his Study. He may there indeed pull down and erect, prai&s;e and condemn, and in &s;hort, make a Con&s;titution Hereditary or Elective, as he &s;hall think fit; but I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t he has no Right openly to revile a Mini&s;try, becau&s;e he likes not the Faces of tho&s;e that compo&s;e it, which perhaps may be as good as his own, tho' not yet in Print in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Shop.

the Buskin and Truncheon&mdash;What, I be|&s;eech you, would Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides</HI> think, if <HI>Will.

<P>Come, come, you are for &s;topping the Mouths of People, and re&s;training the Liberty of the Pre&s;s; a &s;ure Sign, Mr. <HI>Toby,</HI> your Actions won't bear the Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for &s;topping Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ides</HI>'s Mouth, I don't think it of moment enough to go a|bout it; but you know, Friend, it would be le&s;s offen&s;ive, were it &s;omewhat more clean|ly, therefore I'll compound for wa&s;hing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed, and when 'tis wa&s;h'd, what would you have next.</P>
