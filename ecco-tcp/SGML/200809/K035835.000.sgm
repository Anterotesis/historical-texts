<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following Tragedy, has, in his former attempts of the &s;ame kind, avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication or preface. His chief rea&s;on for declining this common mode of appearing before the public, was the nece&s;&s;ity, which it would lay him under, of &s;peaking concerning him&s;elf and his works. The &s;ucce&s;s of Alonzo calls upon him to depart from his former plan; and to break that &s;ilence, which might now be reckoned arrogant, and even ungrateful, to tho&s;e, from whom he in a great mea&s;ure derives his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He embraces with plea&s;ure, this occa&s;ion, to acknowledge his obligations to THE MANAGERS of the theatre, who&s;e friendly, anxious, and active zeal he hath &s;o often experienced: TO THE PER|FORMERS, who have &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly contended with each other, in their very generous endeavours to embelli&s;h the repre&s;entation of the piece: To MRS. BARRY&mdash;but the public voice has exalted HER above his prai&s;e: Yet he claims the merit of
<PB REF="4">having, before others, ob&s;erved her now allowed and unrivalled excellency. From the colour of the dawn, he foretold the brightne&s;s of the day.</P>
<P>For MRS. BARRY he wrote the part of Ormi|&s;inda, and the mo&s;t flattering circum&s;tance to him, in the &s;ucce&s;s of his play, is the univer&s;al opinion, (vouched, not only by the loude&s;t applau&s;e that ever &s;hook the &s;tage, but by the greate&s;t effu&s;ion of tears) that the ACTRESS &s;o much exalted THE CHARACTER, that &s;he exceeded all imagination, and reached the &s;ummit of perfection.</P>

<L>The night preceding the appointed day</L>

<L>The tedious time, for ev'ry minute &s;eem'd</L>
<L>An age to me, I &s;truck into the wood</L>

<L>My am'rous mind a &s;portful purpo&s;e form'd,</L>
<L>Un&s;een to watch the coming of my bride,</L>
<L>And wantonly &s;urprize her. Near the gate</L>
<L>There &s;tood an aged tree. It was a beech,</L>
<L>Which far and wide &s;tretch'd forth its level arms</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="49">Low, near the ground, and form'd a gloomy &s;hade.</L>
<L>Behind its trunk I took my &s;ecret &s;tand;</L>
<L>The gate was full in view, and the green path</L>
<L>On which it open'd. There I &s;tood awhile,</L>
<L>And &s;oon I heard the turning of the key.</L>
<L>My heart beat thick with joy&mdash;and forth &s;he came:&mdash;</L>
<L>Not as I wi&s;h'd: She had a minion with her;</L>
<L>A hand&s;ome youth was tripping by her &s;ide,</L>
<L>Girt with a &s;word, and dre&s;s'd in gay attire.</L>
<L>He &s;eem'd to court her, as they pa&s;s'd along,</L>
<L>Coy, but not angry, for I heard her laugh.</L>
<L>She flung away. He follow'd, &s;oon o'erttok her,</L>

<LG>
<L>THO' lately dead, a Prince&s;s, and of Spain,</L>
<L>I am no Gho&s;t, but Fle&s;h and Blood again!</L>
<L>No time to change this Dre&s;s, it is expedient,</L>
<L>I pa&s;s for Briti&s;h, and your mo&s;t obedient.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How happy, Ladies, for us all&mdash;That we,</L>
<L>Born in this I&s;le, by Magna Charta free,</L>
<L>Are not like Spani&s;h Wives, kept under Lock and Key.</L>
<L>The <HI>Spaniard now,</HI> is not like him of Yore,</L>
<L>Who in his whi&s;ker'd face, his Titles bore!</L>
<L>Nor Joy, nor Vengeance made him &s;mile or grin,</L>
<L>Fix'd were his features, tho' the Devil within!</L>
<L>He, when once jealous, to wa&s;h out the Stain,</L>
<L>Stalk'd home, &s;tabb'd Madam, and &s;talk'd out again.</L>
<L>Thanks to the times, this Dagger-drawing pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Thro' poli&s;h'd Europe, is quite out of Fa&s;hion.</L>
<L><HI>Signor Th' Italian,</HI> quick of &s;ight and hearing,</L>
<L>Once ever li&s;f'ning, and for ever leering,</L>
<L>To <HI>Cara Spo&s;a,</HI> now politely kind,</L>
<L>He, be&s;t of Hu&s;bands, is both deaf and blind.</L>
<L><HI>Mynheer the Dutchman,</HI> with his &s;ober pace,</L>
<L>Whene'er be finds his Rib has wanted Grace,</L>
<L>He feels no Branches &s;prouting from his Brain,</L>
<L>But Calculation makes of Lo&s;s and Gain,</L>
<L>And when to part with her, occa&s;ion's ripe,</L>
<L>Mynheer turns out mine Frow, an &s;mokes his pipe.</L>
<L>When a bri&s;k <HI>Frenchman's</HI> Wife is giv'n to prancing,</L>
<L>It never &s;poils his Singing or his Dancing:</L>
<L><PB REF="95">
Madams, you fal&s;e&mdash;de tout mon Coeur&mdash;Adieu;</L>
<L>Begar you Cocu me, I Cocu you.&mdash;</L>
<L>He, torjours gai, di&s;pels each jealous Vapour,</L>
<L>Takes Snu&s;f, &s;ings Vive l'amour, and cuts a Caper.</L>
<L>As for <HI>John Bull</HI>&mdash;not he in upper Life,</L>
<L>But the plain Engli&s;hman, who loves his Wife;</L>
<L>When hone&s;t John, I &s;ay, has got his doubts,</L>
<L>He &s;ullen grows, &s;cratches his head, and pouts.</L>
<L><HI>What is the Matter with you, Love?</HI> Cries She;</L>
<L><HI>Are you not well, my Deare&s;t?</HI> Humph! Cries He:</L>
<L><HI>You're &s;uch a Brute!&mdash;But, Mr. Bull, I've done:</HI></L>
<L>And if I am a Brute&mdash;Who made me one?</L>
<L><HI>You know my tenderne&s;s&mdash;My heart's too full,</HI></L>
<L>And &s;o's my head&mdash;I thank you Mrs. Bull.</L>
<L><HI>O you ba&s;e Man!</HI>&mdash;Zounds, Madam, there's no bearing,</L>
<L>She falls a weeping, and he falls a &s;wearing:</L>
<L>With Tears and Oaths, the Storm dome&s;tick ends.</L>
<L>The Thunder dies away, the rain de&s;cends,</L>
<L>She &s;abs, he melts, and then they ki&s;s and Friends.</L>
<L>Whatever ca&s;e the&s;e modern Modes may bring,</L>
<L>A little Jealou&s;y is no bad thing:</L>
<L>To me, who &s;peak from Nature unrefin'd,</L>
<L>Jealou&s;y is the Bellows of the Mind.</L>
<L>Touch it but gently, and it warms de&s;ire,</L>
<L>If handled roughly, you are all on Fire!</L>
<L>If it &s;tands &s;till, Affection mu&s;t expire!</L>
<L>This Truth, no true Philo&s;opher can doubt.</L>
<L>Whate'er you do&mdash;let not the Flame go out.</L>
