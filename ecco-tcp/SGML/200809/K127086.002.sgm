<P>MADAME Duval ro&s;e very late this morn|ing, and at one o'clock, we had but ju&s;t break|fa&s;ted, when Mi&s;s Branghton, her brother, Mr. Smith, and Mon&s;ieur du Bois, called to enquire after our healths.</P>
<P>This civility in young Branghton, I much &s;u&s;|pect, was merely the re&s;ult of his father's com|mands; but his &s;i&s;ter and Mr. Smith, I &s;oon found, had motives of their own. Scarce had they &s;poken to Madame Duval, when, advancing eagerly to me, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"who was that gentleman?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Cou&s;in,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Branghton, was <Q REND="inline">"not he the &s;ame gentleman you ran away with that night at the opera?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Goodne&s;s! that he was,"</Q> &s;aid young
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"and I declare, as &s;oon as ever I &s;aw him, I thought I knew his face."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure I'll defy you to forget him,"</Q> an|&s;wered his &s;i&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"if once you had &s;een him: he is the fine&s;t gentleman I ever &s;aw in my life; don't you think &s;o, Mr. Smith?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, you won't give the Lady time to &s;peak,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pray, Ma'am, what is the gentleman's name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Willoughby, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Willoughby! I think I have heard the name. Pray, Ma'am, is he married?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, no, that he is not,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"he looks too &s;mart, by a great deal, for a married man. Pray, Cou&s;in, how did you get acquainted with him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid young Branghton, in the &s;ame breath, <Q REND="inline">"what's his bu&s;ine&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I don't know,"</Q> an&s;wered I.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Something very genteel, I dare &s;ay,"</Q> added Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e he dre&s;&s;es &s;o fine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It ought to be &s;omething that brings in a good income."</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"for I'm &s;ure he did not get that &s;uit of cloaths he had on, un|der thirty or forty pounds; for I know the price of Cloaths pretty well; pray, Ma'am, can you tell me what he has a year?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't talk no more about him;"</Q> cried Ma|dame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"for I don't like to hear his name; I believe he's one of the wor&s;t per&s;ons in the world; for, though I never did him no manner of harm, nor &s;o much as hurt a hair of his head, I know he was an accomplice with that fellow, Captain Mirvan, to take away my life."</Q></P>
<P>Every body, but my&s;elf, now crowding around her for an explanation, a violent rapping at the &s;treet-door was unheard; and, without any pre|vious notice, in the mid&s;t of her narration, Sir
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Clement Willoughby entered the room. They all &s;tarted, and, with looks of guilty confu&s;ion, as if they feared his re&s;entment for having li&s;tened to Madame Duval, they &s;crambled for Chairs, and, in a moment, were all formally &s;eated.</P>
<P>Sir Clement, after a general bow, &s;ingling out Madame Duval, &s;aid, with his u&s;ual ea&s;ine&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I have done my&s;elf the honour of waiting on you, Madam, to enquire if you have any commands to Howard Grove, whither I am going to-mor-row morning."</Q></P>
<P>Then, &s;eeing the &s;torm that gathered in her eyes, before he allowed her time to an&s;wer, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And, if you, Ma|dam, have any with which you will honour me, I &s;hall be happy to execute them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None at all, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None! not to Mi&s;s Mirvan!&mdash;no me&s;&s;age! no letter!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wrote to Mi&s;s Mirvan ye&s;terday by the po&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My application &s;hould have been earlier, had I &s;ooner known your addre&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, recovering from her &s;urprize, <Q REND="inline">"I believe never nobody &s;aw the like of this!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of what! Madam!"</Q> cried the undaunted Sir Clement, turning quick towards her, <Q REND="inline">"I hope no one has offended you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You don't hope no &s;uch a thing!"</Q> cried &s;he, half choaked with pa&s;&s;ion, and ri&s;ing from her chair. This motion was followed by the re&s;t, and, in a moment, every body &s;tood up.</P>
<P>Still Sir Clement was not aba&s;hed; affecting to make a bow of <HI>acknowledgment</HI> to the company in general, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Pary&mdash;I beg&mdash;Ladies,&mdash;pray Gentlemen,&mdash;don't let me di&s;turb you, pray keep your &s;eats."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
<Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Branghton, moving a chair towards him, <Q REND="inline">"won't you &s;it down your|&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are extremely good, Ma'am: rather than make any di&s;turbance&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>And &s;o &s;aying, this &s;trange man &s;eated him&s;elf, as did, in an in&s;tant, every body el&s;e, even Ma|dame Duval her&s;elf, who, overpowered by his boldne&s;s, &s;eemed too full for utterance.</P>
<P>He then, and with as much compo&s;ure as if he had been an expected gue&s;t, began to di&s;cour&s;e on the weather,&mdash;its uncertainty, the heat of the public places in &s;ummer, the emptine&s;s of the town, and other &s;uch common topics.</P>
<P>Nobody, however, an&s;wered him; Mr. Smith &s;eemed afraid, young Branghton a&s;hamed, M. Du Bois amazed, Madame Duval enraged, and my&s;elf determined not to interfere. All that he could obtain, was the notice of Mi&s;s Branghton, who&s;e nods, &s;miles, and attention, had &s;ome ap|pearance of entering into conver&s;ation with him.</P>
<P>At length, growing tired, I &s;uppo&s;e of engag|ing every body's eyes, and nobody's tongue, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Madame Duval and to me, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I regard my&s;elf as peculiarly unfortunate, Ladies, in having fixed upon a time for my vi&s;it to Howard Grove, when you are ab&s;ent from it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, ha&s;tily ri&s;ing, and the next mo|ment as ha&s;tily &s;eating her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"you'll be a want|ing of &s;omebody to make your game of, and &s;o you may think to get <HI>me</HI> there again;&mdash;but I pro|mi&s;e you, Sir, you won't find it &s;o ea&s;y a matter to make me a fool: and be&s;ides that,"</Q> rai&s;ing her voice, <Q REND="inline">"I've found you out, I a&s;&s;ure you; &s;o if ever you go to play your tricks upon me again, I'll make no more ado, but go directly to a ju&s;tice of peace; &s;o, Sir, if you can't think of
<PB N="7" REF="6">
nothing but making people ride about the Coun|try, at all hours of the night, ju&s;t for your di|ver&s;ion, why you'll find I know &s;ome ju&s;tices, as well as Ju&s;tice Tyrrel."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Clement was evidently embarra&s;&s;ed at this attack; yet he affected a look of &s;urprize, and prote&s;ted he did not under&s;tand her meaning.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"if I don't wonder where people can get &s;uch impudence! if you'll &s;ay that, you'll &s;ay any thing; however, if you &s;wear till you're black in the face, I &s;han't be|lieve you; for nobody &s;han't per&s;uade me out of my &s;en&s;es, that I'll promi&s;e you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Doubtle&s;s not, Madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he, with &s;ome he&s;itation, <Q REND="inline">"and I hope you do not &s;u&s;pect I ever had &s;uch an intention; my re&s;pect for you&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Sir, you're va&s;tly polite, all of a &s;ud|den! but I know what it's all for;&mdash;it's only for what you can get!&mdash;you cou'd treat me like no|body at Howard Grove&mdash;but now you &s;ee I've a hou&s;e of my own, you've a mind to wheedle your&s;elf into it; but I &s;ees your de&s;ign, &s;o you need n't trouble your&s;elf to take no more trouble about that, for you &s;hall never get nothing at my hou&s;e,&mdash;not &s;o much as a di&s;h of tea:&mdash;&s;o now, Sir, you &s;ee I can play you trick for trick."</Q></P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o extremely gro&s;s in this &s;peech, that it even di&s;concerted Sir Clement, who was too much confounded to make any an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>It was curious to ob&s;erve the effect which his embarra&s;&s;ment added to the freedom with which Madame Duval addre&s;&s;ed him, had upon the re&s;t of the company: every one, who, before, &s;eem|ed at a lo&s;s how, or if at all, to occupy a chair, now filled it with the mo&s;t ea&s;y compo&s;ure: and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Mr. Smith, who&s;e countenance had exhibited the mo&s;t &s;triking picture of mortified envy, now be|gan to recover his u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfied con|ceit.</P>
<P>Young Branghton, too, who had been appa|rently awed by the pre&s;ence of &s;o fine a gentle|man, was again him&s;elf, rude and familiar, while his mouth was wide di&s;tended into a broad grin, at hearing <HI>his Aunt give the beau &s;uch a trim|ming.</HI></P>
<P>Madame Duval, encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, looked around her with an air of triumph, and continued her harangue: <Q REND="inline">"And &s;o, Sir, I &s;up|po&s;e you thought to have had it all your own way, and to have comed here as often as you plea&s;ed, and to have got me to Howard Grove again, on purpo&s;e to have &s;erved me as you did before; but you &s;hall &s;ee I'm as cunning as you, &s;o you may go and find &s;omebody el&s;e to u&s;e in that manner, and to put your ma&s;k on, and to make a fool of; for as to me, if you go to tell me your &s;tories about the Tower again, for a month toge|ther, I'll never believe 'em no more; and I'll promi&s;e you, Sir, if you think I like &s;uch jokes, you'll find I'm no &s;uch per&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am,&mdash;upon my honour&mdash;I really don't comprehend&mdash;I fancy there is &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, I &s;uppo&s;e you'll tell me next you don't know nothing of the matter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not a word, upon my honour."</Q></P>
<P>O Sir Clement! thought I, is it thus you prize your honour!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"this is the mo&s;t provokinge&s;t part of all! why you might as well tell me I don't know my own name."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
<Q REND="inline">"Here is certainly &s;ome mi&s;take; for I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't a&s;&s;ure me nothing,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, rai&s;ing her voice, <Q REND="inline">"I know what I'm &s;aying, and &s;o do you too; for did not you tell me all that about the Tower; and about M. Du Bois?&mdash;why M. Du Bois was n't never there, nor nigh it, and &s;o it was all your own invention."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May there not be two per&s;ons of the &s;ame name? the mi&s;take was but natural&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't tell me of no mi&s;take, for it was all on purpo&s;e; be&s;ides, did not you come, all in a ma&s;k, to the chariot door, and help to get me put in that ditch?&mdash;I'll promi&s;e you, I've had the greate&s;t mind in the world to take the law of you, and if ever you do as much again, &s;o I will, I a&s;&s;ure you!"</Q></P>
<P>Here Mi&s;s Branghton tittered; Mr. Smith &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly, and young Branghton thru&s;t his handkerchief into his mouth to &s;top his laughter.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Sir Clement, who &s;aw all that pa&s;&s;ed, became now very awkward, even to him|&s;elf, and he &s;tammered very much in &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely, Madam&mdash;&s;urely you&mdash;you cannot do me the&mdash;the inju&s;tice to think&mdash;that I had any &s;hare in the&mdash;the&mdash;the misfortune which&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> Sir,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, with encrea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"you'd be&s;t not &s;tand talking to me at that rate; I know it <HI>was</HI> you,&mdash;and if you &s;tay there, provoking me in &s;uch a manner, I'll &s;end for a Con&s;table this minute."</Q></P>
<P>Young Branghton, at the&s;e words, in &s;pite of all his efforts, bur&s;t into a loud laugh; nor could either his &s;i&s;ter, or Mr. Smith, though with more moderation, forbear joining in his mirth.</P>
<P>Sir Clement darted his eyes towards them, with looks of the mo&s;t angry contempt, and then
<PB N="10" REF="9">
told Madame Duval, that he would not now detain her, to make his vindication, but would wait on her &s;ome time when &s;he was alone.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O <HI>pardie,</HI> Sir,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I don't de&s;ire none of your company; and if you was n't the mo&s;t impudente&s;t per&s;on in the world, you would not dare look me in the face."</Q></P>
<P>The ha, ha, ha's, and he, he, he's, grew more and more uncontroulable, as if the re&s;traint from which they had bur&s;t, had added to their vi|olence. Sir Clement could no longer endure be|ing the object who excited them, and, having no an&s;wer ready for Madame Duval, he ha&s;tily &s;talked towards Mr. Smith and young Branghton, and &s;ternly demanded what they laughed at?</P>
<P>Struck by the air of Importance which he a&s;|&s;umed, and alarmed at the angry tone of his voice, their merriment cea&s;ed, as in&s;tantaneou&s;ly as if it had been directed by clock-work, and they &s;tared fooli&s;hly, now at him, now at each other, without making any an&s;wer but a &s;imple <Q REND="inline">"<HI>No|thing,</HI> Sir!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O <HI>pour le coup,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"this is too much! pray, Sir, what bu&s;ine&s;s have you to come here a ordering people that comes to &s;ee me? I &s;uppo&s;e, next, nobody mu&s;t laugh but your&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With me, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, bowing, <Q REND="inline">"a <HI>lady</HI> may do any thing, and, con&s;e|quently, there is no liberty in which I &s;hall not be happy to indulge <HI>you:</HI>&mdash;but it has never been my cu&s;tom to give the &s;ame licence to <HI>gentlemen.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Then, advancing to me, who had &s;at very qui|etly, on a window, during this &s;cene, he &s;aid," <Q REND="inline">Mi&s;s Anville, I may at lea&s;t acquaint our friends at Howard Grove, that I had the honour of leav|ing you in good health,"</Q> and then, lowering his voice, he added, <Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, my
<PB N="11" REF="10">
deare&s;t creature, who are the&s;e people? and how came you &s;o &s;trangely &s;ituated?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg my re&s;pects to all the family, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered I, aloud, <Q REND="inline">"and I hope you will find them well."</Q></P>
<P>He looked at me reproachfully, but ki&s;&s;ed my hand; and then, bowing to Madame Duval and Mi&s;s Branghton, pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily by the men, and made his exit.</P>
<P>I fancy he will not be very eager to repeat his vi&s;its, for I &s;hould imagine he has rarely, if ever, been before in a &s;ituation &s;o awkward and di&s;a|greeable.</P>
<P>Madame Duval has been all &s;pirits and exulta|tion ever &s;ince he went, and only wi&s;hes Captain Mirvan would call, that &s;he might <HI>do the &s;ame by him.</HI> Mr. Smith, upon hearing that he was a baronet, and &s;eeing him drive off in a very beau|tiful chariot, declared that he would not have laughed upon any account, had he known his rank, and regretted extremely having mi&s;&s;ed &s;uch an opportunity of making &s;o <HI>genteel</HI> an <HI>acquaint|ance.</HI> Young Branghton vowed, that, if he had known as much, he would have <HI>a&s;ked for his cu&s;|tom:</HI> and his &s;i&s;ter has &s;ung his prai&s;es ever &s;ince, prote&s;ting &s;he thought, <HI>all along,</HI> he was a man of <HI>quality</HI> by his <HI>look.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t three evenings have pa&s;&s;ed tolerably quiet, for the Vauxhall adventures had given Madame Duval a &s;urfeit of public places: home
<PB N="12" REF="11">
however, &s;oon growing tire&s;ome, &s;he determined to|night, &s;he &s;aid, to relieve her <HI>ennui,</HI> by &s;ome amu&s;ement; and it was therefore &s;ettled that we &s;hould call upon the Branghtons, at their hou&s;e, and thence proceed to Marybone Gardens.</P>
<P>But, before we reached Snow-Hill, we were caught in a &s;hower of rain: we hurried into the &s;hop, where the fir&s;t object I &s;aw was Mr. Ma|cartney, with a book in his hand, &s;eated in the &s;ame corner where I &s;aw him la&s;t; but his looks were &s;till more wretched than before, his face yet thinner, and his eyes &s;unk almo&s;t hollow into his head. He lifted them up as we entered, and I even thought that they emitted a gleam of joy: involuntarily, I made to him my fir&s;t courte&s;y; he ro&s;e and bowed, with a precipitation that ma|nife&s;ted &s;urprize and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, we were joined by all the family, except Mr. Smith, who, fortunately, was engaged.</P>
<P>Had all the future pro&s;perity of our lives de|pended upon the good or bad weather of this evening, it could not have been treated as a &s;ub|ject of greater importance. <Q REND="inline">"Sure never any thing was &s;o unlucky!&mdash;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Lord, how provok|ing!&mdash;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"It might rain for ever, if it would hold up now!&mdash;"</Q> The&s;e, and &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, with many anxious ob&s;ervations upon the kennels, filled up all the conver&s;ation till the &s;hower was over.</P>
<P>And then a very warm debate aro&s;e, whether we &s;hould pur&s;ue our plan, or defer it to &s;ome finer evening; Mi&s;s Branghtons were for the for|mer; their father was &s;ure it would rain again; Madame Duval, though &s;he dete&s;ted returning home, yet dreaded the dampne&s;s of the gardens.</P>
<P>M. Du Bois then propo&s;ed going to the top of
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the hou&s;e, to examine whether the clouds looked threatening or peaceable; Mi&s;s Branghton &s;tarting at this propo&s;al, &s;aid they might go to Mr. Ma|cartney's room, if they would, but not to her's.</P>
<P>This was enough for the brother; who, with a loud laugh, declared he would have &s;ome <HI>fun,</HI> and immediately led the way, calling to us all to follow. His &s;i&s;ters both ran after him, but no one el&s;e moved.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, young Branghton, coming half way down &s;tairs, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, why don't you all come? why here's Poll's things all about the room!</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Branghton then went, and Madame Du|val, who cannot bear to be excluded from whate|ver is going forward, was handed up &s;tairs by M. Du Bois.</P>
<P>I he&s;itated a few moments whether or not to join them; but, &s;oon perceiving that Mr. Ma|cartney had dropped his book, and that I en|gro&s;&s;ed his whole attention, I prepared, from mere embarra&s;&s;ment, to follow them.</P>
<P>As I went, I heard him move from his chair, and walk &s;lowly after me. Believing that he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to me, and earne&s;tly de&s;iring my|&s;elf to know if, by your means, I could po&s;&s;ibly be of any &s;ervice to him, I fir&s;t &s;lackened my pace, and then turned back. But, though I thus met him half-way, he &s;eemed to want courage or re&s;olution to addre&s;s me; for, when he &s;aw me returning, with a look extremely di&s;ordered, he retreated ha&s;tily from me.</P>
<P>Not knowing what I ought to do, I went to the &s;treet-door, where I &s;tood &s;ome time, hoping he would be able to recover him&s;elf: but, on the con|trary, his agitation encrea&s;ed every moment; he walked up and down the room; in a quick, but
<PB N="14" REF="13">
un&s;teady pace, &s;eeming equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and irre&s;olute: and, at length, with a deep &s;igh, he flung him&s;elf into a chair.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much affected by the appearance of &s;uch extreme angui&s;h, that I could remain no lon|ger in the room; I therefore glided by him, and went up &s;tairs; but, ere I had gone five &s;teps, he precipitately followed me, and, in a broken voice, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Madam!&mdash;for Heaven's &s;ake&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;topped, but I in&s;tantly de&s;cended, re&s;train|ing, as well as I was able, the fullne&s;s of my own concern. I waited &s;ome time in painful expectati|on, for his &s;peaking: all that I had heard of his poverty, occurring to me, I was upon the point of pre&s;enting him my pur&s;e, but the fear of mi&s;tak|ing or offending him, deterred me. Finding, however, that he continued &s;ilent, I ventured to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Did you&mdash;Sir, wi&s;h to &s;peak to me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I did!"</Q> cried he, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"but now&mdash;I cannot!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, another time,&mdash;perhaps if you recollect your&s;elf&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Another time!"</Q> repeated he mournfully, <Q REND="inline">"alas! I look not forward but to mi&s;ery and de|&s;pair!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Sir,"</Q> cried I, extremely &s;hocked, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t not talk thus!&mdash;if you for&s;ake <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> how can you expect&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>I &s;topped. <Q REND="inline">"Tell me, tell me,</Q> "cried he, with eagerne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"who you are?&mdash;whence you come?&mdash;and by what &s;trange means you &s;eem to be arbitre&s;s and ruler of the de&s;tiny of &s;uch a wretch as I am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"I could &s;erve you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You can!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
<Q REND="inline">"And how? pray tell me how?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To tell you&mdash;is death to me! yet I <HI>will</HI> tell you,&mdash;I have a <HI>right</HI> to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance,&mdash;you have deprived me of the only re&s;ource to which I could apply,&mdash;and therefore&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, pray, &s;peak;"</Q> cried I, putting my hand into my pocket, <Q REND="inline">"they will be down &s;tairs in a moment!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will, Madam.&mdash;Can you&mdash;will you&mdash;I think you will!&mdash;may I then&mdash;"</Q> he &s;topped and pau&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ay, will you&mdash;"</Q> then &s;uddenly turning from me, <Q REND="inline">"Great Heaven! I cannot &s;peak!"</Q> and he went back to the &s;hop.</P>
<P>I now put my pur&s;e in my hand, and following him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If indeed, Sir, I can a&s;&s;i&s;t you, why &s;hould you deny me &s;o great a &s;atisfaction? Will you permit me to&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>I dared not go on; but with a countenance ve|ry much &s;oftened, he approached me, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Your voice, Madam, is the voice of Com|pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;&s;uch a voice as the&s;e ears have long been &s;trangers to!"</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, young Branghton called out vehe|mently to me, to come up &s;tairs; I &s;eized the op|portunity of ha&s;tening away: and therefore &s;ay|ing, <Q REND="inline">"Heaven, Sir, protect and comfort you!&mdash;"</Q> I let fall my pur&s;e upon the ground, not daring to pre&s;ent it to him, and ran up &s;tairs with the utmo&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>Too well do I know you, my ever honoured Sir, to fear your di&s;plea&s;ure for this action: I mu&s;t, however, a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall need no fre&s;h &s;upply during my &s;tay in town, as I am at little expence, and hope &s;oon to return to Howard Grove.</P>
<P>Soon, did I &s;ay! when not a fortnight is yet
<PB N="16" REF="15">
expired, of the long and tedious month I mu&s;t linger out here!</P>
<P>I had many wittici&s;ms to endure from the Branghtons, upon account of my &s;taying &s;o long with the <HI>Scotch mope,</HI> as they call him; but I at|tend to them very little, for my whole heart was filled with pity and concern. I was very glad to find the Marybone &s;cheme was deferred, another &s;hower of rain having put a &s;top to the di&s;&s;ention upon this &s;ubject; the re&s;t of the evening was employed in mo&s;t violent quarrelling between Mi&s;s Polly and her brother, on account of the di&s;covery made by the latter, of the &s;tate of her apartment.</P>
<P>We came home early; and I have &s;tolen from Madame Duval and M. Du Bois, who is here for ever, to write to my be&s;t friend.</P>
<P>I am mo&s;t &s;incerely rejoiced that this opportu|nity has offered for my contributing what little re|lief was in my power, to this unhappy man; and I hope it will be &s;ufficient to enable him to pay his debts to this pitile&s;s family.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DISPLEASURE? my Evelina!&mdash;you have but done your duty; you have but &s;hewn that humanity without which I &s;hould blu&s;h to own my child. It is mine, however, to &s;ee that your genero&s;ity be not repre&s;&s;ed by your &s;uffering from indulging it; I remit to you, therefore, not merely a token of my approbation, but an ac|knowledgment of my de&s;ire to participate in your charity.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
O my child, were my fortune equal to my con|fidence in thy benevolence, with what tran&s;port &s;hould I, through thy means, devote it to the re|lief of indigent virtue! yet let us not repine at the limitation of our power, for, while our boun|ty is proportioned to our ability, the difference of the greater or le&s;s donation, can weigh but little in the &s;cale of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In reading your account of the mi&s;guided man, who&s;e mi&s;ery has &s;o largely excited your compa&s;|&s;ion, I am led to apprehend, that his unhappy &s;i|tuation is le&s;s the effect of misfortune, than of mi&s;conduct. If he is reduced to that &s;tate of poverty repre&s;ented by the Branghtons, he &s;hould endeavour by activity and indu&s;try to retrieve his affairs; and not pa&s;s his time in idle reading in the very &s;hop of his creditor.</P>
<P>The pi&s;tol &s;cene made me &s;hudder: the cou|rage with which you pur&s;ued this de&s;perate man, at once delighted and terrified me. Be ever thus, my deare&s;t Evelina, dauntle&s;s in the cau&s;e of di&s;|tre&s;s! let no weak fears, no timid doubts, deter you from the exertion of your duty, according to the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of it that Nature has implanted in your mind. Though gentlene&s;s and Mode&s;ty are the peculiar attributes of your &s;ex, yet fortitude and firmne&s;s, when occa&s;ion demands them, are vir|tues as noble and as becoming in women as in men: the right line of conduct is the &s;ame for both &s;ex|es, though the manner in which it is pur&s;ued, may &s;omewhat vary, and be accommodated to the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the different travellers.</P>
<P>There is, however, &s;omething &s;o my&s;terious in all you have yet &s;een or heard of this wretched man, that I am unwilling to &s;tamp a bad impre&s;|&s;ion of his character, upon &s;o &s;light and partial a knowledge of it. Where any thing is doubtful, the ties of &s;ociety, and the laws of humanity,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
claim a favourable interpretation; but remember, my dear child, that tho&s;e of di&s;cretion have an equal claim to your regard.</P>
<P>As to Sir Clement Willoughby, I know not how to expre&s;s my indignation at his conduct. In&s;olence &s;o un&s;ufferable, and the implication of &s;u&s;picions &s;o &s;hocking, irritate me to a degree of wrath, which I hardly thought my almo&s;t worn|out pa&s;&s;ions were capable of again experiencing. You mu&s;t conver&s;e with him no more; he ima|gines, from the pliability of your temper, that he may offend you with impunity; but his beha|viour ju&s;tifies, nay, calls for, your avowed re|&s;entment: do not, therefore, he&s;itate in forbid|ding him your &s;ight.</P>
<P>The Branghtons, Mr. Smith, and young Brown, however ill-bred and di&s;agreeable, are objects too contemptible for &s;erious di&s;plea&s;ure: yet I grieve much that my Evelina &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed to their rudene&s;s and impertinence.</P>
<P>The very day that this tedious month expires, I &s;hall &s;end Mrs. Clinton to town, who will ac|company you to Howard Grove. Your &s;tay there will, I hope, be &s;hort, for I feel daily an encrea&s;ing impatience to fold my beloved child to my bo&s;om!</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received, my deare&s;t Sir, your kind pre&s;ent, and &s;till kinder letter. Surely never had orphan &s;o little to regret as your grateful
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Evelina! though motherle&s;s, though wor&s;e than fatherle&s;s, bereft from infancy of the two fir&s;t and greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of life, never has &s;he had cau&s;e to deplore their lo&s;s; never has &s;he felt the omi&s;|&s;ion of a parent's tenderne&s;s, care, or indulgence; never, but from &s;orrow for <HI>them,</HI> had rea&s;on to grieve at the &s;eparation! Mo&s;t thankfully do I receive the token of your approbation, and mo&s;t &s;tudiou&s;ly will I endeavour &s;o to di&s;po&s;e of it, as may merit your generous confidence in my con|duct.</P>
<P>Your doubts concerning Mr. Macartney give me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. Indeed, Sir, he has not the appearance of a man who&s;e &s;orrows are the effect of guilt. But I hope, ere I leave town, to be better acquainted with his &s;ituation, and enabled with more certainty of his worth, to recommend him to your favour.</P>
<P>I am very willing to relinqui&s;h all acquaintance with Sir Clement Willoughby, as far as it may de|pend upon my&s;elf &s;o to do; but indeed, I know not how I &s;hould be able to ab&s;olutely <HI>forbid him my &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Mirvan, in her la&s;t letter, informs me that he is now at Howard Grove, where he continues in high favour with the Captain, and is the life and &s;pirit of the hou&s;e. My time, &s;ince I wrote la&s;t, has pa&s;&s;ed very quietly; Madame Duval having been kept at home by a bad cold, and the Branghtons by bad weather. The young man, indeed, has called two or three times, and his behaviour, though equally ab&s;urd, is more unaccountable than ever: he &s;peaks very little, takes hardly any notice of Madame Duval, and never looks at me, without a broad grin. Some|times he approaches me, as if with intention to
<PB N="20" REF="19">
communicate intelligence of importance, and then, &s;uddenly &s;topping &s;hort, laughs rudely in my face.</P>
<P>O how happy &s;hall I be, when the worthy Mrs. Clinton arrives!</P>

<P>Ye&s;terday Morning, Mr. Smith called, to ac|quaint us that the Hamp&s;tead a&s;&s;embly was to be held that evening; and then he pre&s;ented Ma|dame Duval with one ticket, and brought another to me. I thanked him for his intended civility, but told him I was &s;urprized he had &s;o &s;oon forgot my having already declined going to the ball.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Ma'am,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"how &s;hould I &s;uppo&s;e you were in earne&s;t? come, come, don't be cro&s;s; here's your Grandmama ready to take care of you, &s;o you can have no fair objection, for &s;he'll &s;ee that I don't run away with you. Be|&s;ides, Ma'am, I got the tickets on purpo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you were determined, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"in making me this offer, to allow me no choice of re|fu&s;al or acceptance, I mu&s;t think my&s;elf le&s;s oblig|ed to your intention, than I was willing to do.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear Ma'am,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"you're &s;o &s;mart, there is no &s;peaking to you;&mdash;indeed, you are mon&s;trous &s;mart, Ma'am! but come, your Grandmama &s;hall a&s;k you, and then I know you'll not be &s;o cruel."</Q></P>
<P>Madame Duval was very ready to interfere; &s;he de&s;ired me to make no further oppo&s;ition, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould go her&s;elf, and in&s;i&s;ted upon my accompanying her. It was in vain that I remon|&s;trated; I only incurred her anger, and Mr. Smith, having given both the tickets to Madame Duval, with an air of triumph, &s;aid he &s;hould call early in the evening, and took leave.</P>
<P>I was much chagrined at being thus compelled to owe even the &s;hadow of an obligation to &s;o for|ward
<PB N="21" REF="20">
a young man; but I determined that nothing &s;hould prevail upon me to dance with him, how|ever my refu&s;al might give offence.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, when he returned, it was evident that he purpo&s;ed to both charm and a&s;to|ni&s;h me by his appearance; he was dre&s;&s;ed in a very &s;hewy manner, but without any ta&s;te, and the inelegant &s;martne&s;s of his air and deport|ment, his vi&s;ible &s;truggle, again&s;t education, to put on the fine gentleman, added to his frequent con&s;cious glances at a dre&s;s to which he was but little accu&s;tomed, very effectually de&s;troyed his aim of <HI>figuring,</HI> and rendered all his efforts u&s;e|le&s;s.</P>
<P>During tea, entered Mi&s;s Branghton and her brother. I was &s;orry to ob&s;erve the con&s;ternation of the former, when &s;he perceived Mr. Smith. I had intended applying to her for advice upon this occa&s;ion, but been always deterred by her di&s;a|greeable abruptne&s;s. Having ca&s;t her eyes &s;eve|ral times from Mr. Smith to me, with manife&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf &s;ullenly in the win|dow, &s;carce an&s;wering Madame Duval's enqui|ries, and, when I &s;poke to her, turning ab&s;o|lutely away from me.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith, delighted at this mark of his im|portance, &s;at indolently quiet on his chair, endea|vouring by his looks rather to di&s;play, than to conceal, his inward &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good gracious!"</Q> cried young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"why, you're all as fine as five-pence! Why, where are you going?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To the Hamp&s;tead Ball,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Smith.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To a ball!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"Why, what, is Aunt going to a ball? Ha, ha, ha!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, to be &s;ure,"</Q> cried Madame Duval; <Q REND="inline">"I don't know nothing need hinder me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray, Aunt, will you dance too?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps I may; but I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, that's none of your bu&s;ine&s;s, whether I do or not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord! well, I &s;hould like to go! I &s;hould like to &s;ee Aunt dance, of all things! But the joke is, I don't believe &s;he'll get ever a partner.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You're the mo&s;t rude&s;t boy ever I &s;ee,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, angrily: <Q REND="inline">"but, I promi&s;e you, I'll tell your father what you &s;ay, for I've no notion of &s;uch rudene&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Lord, Aunt, what are you &s;o angry for? there's no &s;peaking a word, but you fly in|to a pa&s;&s;ion: you're as bad as Biddy or Poll for that, for you're always a &s;colding."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I de&s;ire, Tom,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"you'd &s;peak for your&s;elf, and not make &s;o free with my name."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There, now, &s;he's up! there's nothing but quarrelling with the women: it's my belief they like it better than victuals and drink."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fie, Tom,"</Q> cried Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"you ne|ver remember your manners before the ladies: I'm &s;ure you never heard me &s;peak &s;o rude to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Lord, <HI>you</HI> are a beau; but that's nothing to me. So, if you've a mind, you may be &s;o polite as to dance with Aunt your&s;elf."</Q> Then with a loud laugh, he declared it would be <HI>good fun</HI> to &s;ee them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let it be never &s;o good, or never &s;o bad,"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"you won't &s;ee nothing of it, I promi&s;e you; &s;o pray don't let me hear no more of &s;uch vulgar pieces of fun; for, I a&s;|&s;ure you, I don't like it. And as to my dancing
<PB N="23" REF="22">
with Mr. Smith, you may &s;ee wonderfuller things than that any day in the week."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, as to that, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, looking much &s;urpri&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"I always thought you intended to play at cards, and &s;o I thought to dance with the young lady."</Q></P>
<P>I gladly &s;eized this opportunity to make my declaration, that I &s;hould not dance at all.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not dance at all!"</Q> repeated Mi&s;s Brangh|ton; <Q REND="inline">"yes, that's a likely matter truly, when peo|ple go to balls."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h &s;he mayn't,"</Q> &s;aid the brother; <Q REND="inline">"cau&s;e then Mr. Smith will have nobody but Aunt for a partner. Lord, how mad he'll be!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, as to that,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"I do'nt at all fear prevailing with the young lady, if once I get her to the room."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> cried I, much offended by his conceit, <Q REND="inline">"you are mi&s;taken; and therefore I beg leave to undeceive you, as you may be a&s;&s;ur|ed my re&s;olution will not alter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then pray, Mi&s;s, if it is not impertinent,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Branghton, &s;neeringly, <Q REND="inline">"What do you go for?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Merely and &s;olely,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"to com|ply with the reque&s;t of Madame Duval."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s,</Q> cried young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"Bid only wi&s;hes it was &s;he, for &s;he has ca&s;t a &s;heep's-eye at Mr. Smith this long while."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tom,"</Q> cried the &s;i&s;ter, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"I've the greate&s;t mind in the world to box your ears! How dare you &s;ay &s;uch a thing of me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, hang it, Tom, no, that's wrong,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, &s;impering, <Q REND="inline">"it is indeed, to tell the lady's &s;ecrets.&mdash;But never mind him, Mi&s;s Biddy, for I won't believe him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, I know Bid would give her ears to
<PB N="24" REF="23">
go,"</Q> returned the brother; <Q REND="inline">"but only Mr. Smith likes Mi&s;s be&s;t,&mdash;&s;o does every body el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>While the &s;i&s;ter gave him a very angry an&s;wer, Mr. Smith &s;aid to me, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"Why now, Ma'am, how can you be &s;o cruel as to be &s;o much hand&s;omer than your cou&s;ins? Nobody can look at them when you are by."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s,"</Q> cried young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"what|ever he &s;ays to you, don't mind him, for he means no good; I'll give you my word for it, he'll never marry you, for he has told me again and again, he'll never marry as long as he lives; be&s;ides, if he'd any mind to be married, there's Bid would have had him long ago, and thanked him too."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, come, Tom, don't tell &s;ecrets; you'll make the ladies afraid of me: but I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> lowering his voice, <Q REND="inline">"if I <HI>did</HI> marry, it &s;hould be your cou&s;in."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Should</HI> be!&mdash;did you ever, my dear Sir, hear &s;uch unauthori&s;ed freedom? I looked at him with a contempt I did not wi&s;h to expre&s;s, and walked to the other end of the room.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after, Mr. Smith &s;ent for a hackney|coach. When I would have taken leave of Mi&s;s Branghton, &s;he turned angrily from me, without making any an&s;wer. She &s;uppo&s;es, perhaps, that I have rather &s;ought, than endeavoured to a|void, the notice and civilities of this conceited young man.</P>
<P>The ball was at the <HI>long room</HI> at Hamp&s;tead.</P>
<P>This room &s;eems very well named, for I be|lieve it would be difficult to find any other epi|thet which might, with propriety, di&s;tingui&s;h it, as it is without ornament, elegance, or any &s;ort of &s;ingularity, and merely to be marked by its length.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
I was &s;aved from the importunities of Mr. Smith, the beginning of the evening, by Madame Duval's declaring her intention to dance the two fir&s;t dances with him her&s;elf. Mr. Smith's chagrin was very evident, but as &s;he paid no regard to it, he was nece&s;&s;itated to lead her out.</P>
<P>I was, however, by no means plea&s;ed, when &s;he &s;aid &s;he was determined to dance a minuet. Indeed I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed, not having had the lea&s;t idea &s;he would have con&s;ented to, much le&s;s propo&s;ed, &s;uch an exhibition of her per&s;on.</P>
<P>She had &s;ome trouble to make her intentions known, as Mr. Smith was rather aver&s;e to &s;peak|ing to the Ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>During this minuet, how much did I rejoice in being &s;urrounded only with &s;trangers! She danced in a &s;tyle &s;o uncommon; her age, her &s;howy dre&s;s, and an unu&s;ual quantity of <HI>rouge,</HI> drew upon her the eyes, and, I fear, the deri&s;ion of the whole company. Who &s;he danced with, I know not; but Smith was &s;o ill-bred as to laugh at her very openly, and to &s;peak of her with as much ridi|cule as was in his power. But I would neither look at, nor li&s;ten to him; nor would I &s;uffer him to proceed with a &s;peech which he began, expre&s;&s;ive of his vexation at being forced to dance with her. I told him, very gravely, that complaints upon &s;uch a &s;ubject might, with le&s;s impropriety, be made to every per&s;on in the room, than to me.</P>
<P>When &s;he returned to us, &s;he di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me ve|ry much, by a&s;king what I thought of her minu|et. I &s;poke as civilly as I could, but the coldne&s;s of my compliment evidently di&s;appointed reh. She then called upon Mr. Smith to &s;ecure a good
<PB N="26" REF="25">
place among the country-dancers; and away they went, though not before he had taken the liberty to &s;ay to me in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t to you, Ma'am, I &s;hall be quite out of counte|nance, if any of my acquaintance &s;hould &s;ee me dancing with the old lady!"</Q></P>
<P>For a few moments I very much rejoiced at be|ing relieved from this trouble&s;ome man; but &s;carce had I time to congratulate my&s;elf, ere I was acco&s;ted by another, who <HI>begged the favour of hopping a dance</HI> with me.</P>
<P>I told him that I &s;hould not dance at all; but he thought proper to importune me, very freely, not to be &s;o cruel; and I was obliged to a&s;&s;ume no little haughtine&s;s ere I could &s;atisfy him I was &s;erious.</P>
<P>After this, I was addre&s;&s;ed, much in the &s;ame manner, by &s;everal other young men, of whom the appearance and language were equally inele|gant and low-bred: &s;o that I &s;oon found my &s;itu|ation was both di&s;agreeable and improper; &s;ince, as I was quite alone, I fear I mu&s;t &s;eem rather to invite, than to forbid, the offers and notice I re|ceived. And yet, &s;o great was my apprehen&s;ion of this interpretation, that I am &s;ure, my dear Sir, you would have laughed had you &s;een how proud|ly grave I appeared.</P>
<P>I knew not whether to be glad or &s;orry, when Madame Duval and Mr. Smith returned. The latter in&s;tantly renewed his tire&s;ome entreaties, and Madame Duval &s;aid &s;he would go to the card|table: and, as &s;oon as &s;he was accommodated, &s;he de&s;ired us to join the dancers.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with the arguments that followed. Mr. Smith teazed me till I was weary of re&s;i&s;tance; and I &s;hould at la&s;t have been ob|liged to &s;ubmit, had I not fortunately recollected
<PB N="27" REF="26">
the affair of Mr. Lovel, and told my per&s;ecutor, that it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould dance with him, even if I wi&s;hed it, as I had refu&s;ed &s;everal per&s;ons in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>He was not contented with being extremely chagrined, but took the liberty, openly and warm|ly, to expo&s;tulate with me upon not having &s;aid I was engaged.</P>
<P>The total di&s;regard with which, involuntarily, I heard him, made him &s;oon change the &s;ubject. In truth, I had no power to attend to him, for all my thoughts were occupied in re-tracing the tran&s;|actions of the two former balls at which I had been pre&s;ent. The party&mdash;the conver&s;ation&mdash;the com|pany&mdash;O how great the contra&s;t!</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, however, he contrived to draw my attention to him&s;elf, by his extreme imperti|nence; for he cho&s;e to expre&s;s what he called his <HI>admiration</HI> of me, in terms &s;o open and familiar, that he forced me to expre&s;s my di&s;plea&s;ure with equal plainne&s;s.</P>
<P>But how was I &s;urpri&s;ed, when I found he had the temerity&mdash;what el&s;e can I call it?&mdash;to impute my re&s;entment to doubts of his honour; for he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Ma'am, you mu&s;t be a little pa|tient; I a&s;&s;ure you I have no bad de&s;igns, I have not, upon my word; but, really, there is no re|&s;olving upon &s;uch a thing as matrimony all at once; what with the lo&s;s of one's liberty, and what with the ridicule of all one's acquaintance,&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am, you are the fir&s;t lady who ever made me even demur upon this &s;ubject; for, after all, my dear Ma'am, marriage is the devil!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your opinion, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"of either the married or the &s;ingle life, can be of no man|ner of con&s;equence to me, and therefore I would
<PB N="28" REF="27">
by no means trouble you to di&s;cu&s;s their different merits."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, really, Ma'am, as to your being a lit|tle out of &s;orts, I mu&s;t own I can't wonder at it, for, to be &s;ure, marriage is all in all with the la|dies; but with us gentlemen it's quite another thing! Now only put your&s;elf in my place,&mdash;&s;up|po&s;e you had &s;uch a large acquaintance of gentle|men as I have,&mdash;and that you had always been u&s;ed to appear a little&mdash;a little &s;mart among them,&mdash;why now, how &s;hould you like to let your&s;elf down all at once into a married man?"</Q></P>
<P>I could not tell what to an&s;wer; &s;o much con|ceit, and &s;o much ignorance, both a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;ilenced me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"there is not only Mi&s;s Biddy,&mdash;though I &s;hould have &s;corned to mention her, if her brother had not blab'd, for I'm quite particular in keeping ladies &s;ecrets,&mdash;but there are a great many other ladies that have been propo&s;ed to me,&mdash;but I never thought twice of any of them,&mdash;that is, not in a <HI>&s;erious</HI> way,&mdash;&s;o you may very well be proud,"</Q> offering to take my hand, <Q REND="inline">"for I a&s;&s;ure you, there is nobody &s;o likely to catch me at la&s;t as your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried I, drawing my&s;elf back as haugh|tily as I could, <Q REND="inline">"you are totally mi&s;taken, if you imagine you have given me any pride I felt not be|fore, by this conver&s;ation; on the contrary, you mu&s;t allow me to tell you, I find it too humilia|ting to bear with it any longer."</Q></P>
<P>I then placed my&s;elf behind the chair of Madame Duval; who, when &s;he heard of the partners I had refu&s;ed, pitied my ignorance of the world, but no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon my dancing.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
Indeed, the extreme vanity of this man makes me exert a &s;pirit which I did not, till now know that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but I cannot endure that he &s;hould think me at his di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the evening pa&s;&s;ed very quietly, as Mr. Smith did not attempt again to &s;peak to me; except, indeed, after we had left the room, and while Madame Duval was &s;eating her&s;elf in the coach, he &s;aid, in a voice of <HI>pique,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Next time I take the trouble to get any tickets for a young lady, I'll make a bargain beforehand that &s;he &s;ha'n't turn me over to her grandmother."</Q></P>
<P>We came home very &s;afe; and thus ended this &s;o long projected, and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable affair.</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received a mo&s;t affecting letter from Mr. Macartney. I will inclo&s;e it, my dear Sir, for your peru&s;al. More than ever have I cau&s;e to rejoice that I was able to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Mr. Macartney to Mi&s;s Anville.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMPRESSED with the deepe&s;t, the mo&s;t heart-felt &s;en&s;e of the exalted humanity with which you have re&s;cued from de&s;truction an un|happy &s;tranger, allow me, with the humble&s;t gra|titude, to offer you my fervent acknowledgments, and to implore your pardon for the terror I have cau&s;ed you.</P>
<P>You bid me, Madam, live: I have now, in|deed, a motive for life, &s;ince I &s;hould not willing|ly
<PB N="30" REF="29">
quit the world, while I withhold from the needy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed any &s;hare of that charity which a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o noble would, otherwi&s;e, be&s;tow up|on them.</P>
<P>The benevolence with which you have intere&s;t|ed your&s;elf in my concerns, induces me to &s;uppo&s;e you would wi&s;h to be acquainted with the cau&s;e of that de&s;peration from which you &s;natched me, and the particulars of that mi&s;ery of which you have, &s;o wonderfully, been a witne&s;s. Yet, as this ex|planation will require that I &s;hould divulge &s;ecrets of a nature the mo&s;t delicate, I mu&s;t entreat you to regard them as &s;acred, even though I forbear to mention the names of the parties concerned.</P>
<P>I was brought up in Scotland, though my mo|ther, who had the &s;ole care of me, was an Eng|li&s;hman, and had not one relation in that country. She devoted to me her whole time. The retirement in which we lived, and the di&s;|tance from our natural friends, &s;he often told me were the effect of an unconquerable melancholy with which &s;he was &s;eized, upon the &s;udden lo&s;s of my father, &s;ome time before I was born.</P>
<P>At Aberdeen, where I fini&s;hed my education, I formed a friend&s;hip with a young man of fortune, which I con&s;idered as the chief happine&s;s of my life;&mdash;but, when he quitted his &s;tudies, I con&s;ider|ed it as my chief misfortune, for he immediately prepared, by direction of his friends, to make the tour of Europe. For my part, de&s;igned for the church, and with no pro&s;pect even of maintenance but from my own indu&s;try, I &s;carce dared permit even a wi&s;h of accompanying him. It is true, he would joyfully have borne my expences; but my affection was as free from meanne&s;s as his own, and I made a determination the mo&s;t &s;olemn never
<PB N="31" REF="30">
to le&s;&s;en its dignity, by &s;ubmitting to pecuniary obligations.</P>
<P>We corre&s;ponded with great regularity, and the mo&s;t unbounded confidence, for the &s;pace of two years, when he arrived at Lyons in his way home. He wrote me, thence, the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing invitation to meet him at Paris, where he intended to remain for &s;ome time. My de&s;ire to comply with his re|que&s;t, and &s;horten our ab&s;ence, was &s;o earne&s;t, that my mother, too indulgent to controul me, lent me what a&s;&s;i&s;tance was in her power, and, in an ill-fated moment I &s;et out for that capital.</P>
<P>My meeting with this dear friend was the hap|pie&s;t event of my life: he introduced me to all his acquaintance; and &s;o quickly did time &s;eem to pa&s;s at that delightful period, that the &s;ix weeks I had allotted for my &s;tay were gone, ere I was &s;en|&s;ible I had mi&s;&s;ed &s;o many days. But I mu&s;t now own, that the company of my friend was not the &s;ole &s;ubject of my felicity: I became acquainted with a young lady, daughter of an Engli&s;hman of di&s;tinction, with whom I formed an attachment which I have a thou&s;and times vowed, a thou&s;and times &s;incerely thought would be la&s;ting as my life. She had but ju&s;t quitted a convent, in which &s;he had been placed when a child, and though Engli&s;h by birth, &s;he could &s;carcely &s;peak her na|tive language. Her per&s;on and di&s;po&s;ition were equally engaging; but chiefly I adored her for the greatne&s;s of the expectations which, for my &s;ake, &s;he was willing to re&s;ign.</P>
<P>When the time for my re&s;idence in Paris expir|ed, I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at the idea of quitting it; yet I had not the courage to make our attach|ment known to her father, who might rea&s;onably form for her &s;uch views as would make him re|ject, with a contempt which I could not bear to
<PB N="32" REF="31">
think of, &s;uch an offer as mine. Yet I had free acce&s;s to the hou&s;e, where &s;he &s;eemed to be left almo&s;t wholly to the guidance of an old &s;ervant, who was my fa&s;t friend.</P>
<P>But, to be brief, the &s;udden and unexpected re|turn of her father, one fatal afternoon, proved the beginning of the mi&s;ery which has ever &s;ince de|voured me. I doubt not but he had li&s;tened to our conver&s;ation, for he darted into the room with the rage of a madman. Heavens! what a &s;cene followed!&mdash;what abu&s;ive language did the &s;hame of a clande&s;tine affair, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of acting ill, induce me to brook! At length, how|ever, his fury exceeded my patience,&mdash;he called me a beggarly, cowardly Scotchman. Fired at the words, I drew my &s;word; he, with equal alertne&s;s, drew his; for he was not an old man, but, on the contrary, &s;trong and able as my&s;elf. In vain his daughter pleaded;&mdash;in vain did I, re|pentant of my anger, retreat;&mdash;his reproaches continued; my&s;elf, my country, were loaded with infamy,&mdash;till, no longer con&s;training my rage,&mdash;we fought,&mdash;and he fell!</P>
<P>At that moment I could almo&s;t have de&s;troyed my&s;elf! The young lady fainted with terror; the old &s;ervant, drawn to us by the noi&s;e of the &s;cuf|fle, entreated me to e&s;cape, and promi&s;ed to bring intelligence of what &s;hould pa&s;s to my apartment. The di&s;turbance which I heard rai&s;ed in the hou&s;e obliged me to comply, and, in a &s;tate of mind in|conceivably wretched, I tore my&s;elf away.</P>
<P>My friend, who I found at home, &s;oon di&s;cover|ed the whole affair. It was near midnight ere the woman came. She told me that her ma&s;ter was living, and her young mi&s;tre&s;s re&s;tored to her &s;en|&s;es. The ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for my leaving Paris, while any danger remained, was forcibly urged by
<PB N="33" REF="32">
my friend: the &s;ervant promi&s;ed to acquaint him of whatever pa&s;&s;ed, and he, to tran&s;mit to me her information. Thus circum&s;tanced, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of this dear friend, I effected my depar|ture from Paris, and, not long after, I returned to Scotland. I would fain have &s;topped by the way, that I might have been nearer the &s;cene of all my concerns, but the low &s;tate of my finances denied me that &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable &s;ituation of my mind was &s;oon di&s;covered by my mother; nor would &s;he re&s;t till I communicated the cau&s;e. She heard my whole &s;tory with an agitation which a&s;toni&s;hed me;&mdash;the <HI>name</HI> of the parties concerned, &s;eemed to &s;trike her with horror;&mdash;but when I &s;aid, <HI>We fought, and he fell;</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My &s;on,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you have then murdered your father!"</Q> and &s;he &s;unk breathle&s;s at my feet. Comments, Madam, upon &s;uch a &s;cene as this, would to you be &s;uper|fluous, and to me agonizing: I cannot, for both our &s;akes, be too conci&s;e. When &s;he recovered, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed all the particulars of a tale which &s;he had hoped never to have revealed.&mdash;Alas! the lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained of my father was not by death!&mdash;bound to her by no ties but tho&s;e of ho|nour, he had voluntarily de&s;erted her!&mdash;Her &s;et|tling in Scotland was not the effect of choice,&mdash;&s;he was bani&s;hed thither by a family but too ju&s;tly in|cen&s;ed;&mdash;pardon, Madam, that I cannot be more explicit!</P>
<P>My &s;en&s;es, in the greatne&s;s of my mi&s;ery, actu|ally for&s;ook me, and for more than a week I was wholly delirious. My unfortunate mother was yet more to be pitied, for &s;he pined with unmitigated &s;orrow, eternally reproaching her&s;elf for the dan|ger to which her too &s;trict &s;ilence had expo&s;ed me. When I recovered my rea&s;on, my impatience to
<PB N="34" REF="33">
hear from Paris almo&s;t deprived me of it again; and though the length of time I waited for letters might ju&s;tly be attributed to contrary winds, I could not bear the delay, and was twenty times upon the point of returning thither at all hazards. At length, however, &s;everal letters arrived at once, and from the mo&s;t in&s;upportable of my af|flictions I was then relieved, for they acquainted me that the horrors of parricide were not in re&s;erve for me. They informed me al&s;o, that as &s;oon as the wound was healed, a journey would be made to England, where my unhappy <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> was to be received by an aunt with whom &s;he was to live.</P>
<P>This intelligence &s;omewhat quieted the violence of my &s;orrows. I in&s;tantly formed a plan of meet|ing them in London, and, by revealing the whole dreadful &s;tory, convincing this irritated parent that he had nothing more to apprehend from his daugh|ter's unfortunate choice. My mother con&s;ented, and gave me a letter to prove the truth of my a&s;|&s;ertions. As I could but ill afford to make this journey, I travelled in the cheape&s;t way that was po&s;&s;ible. I took an ob&s;cure lodging, I need not, Madam, tell you where,&mdash;and boarded with the people of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Here I langui&s;hed, week after week, vainly hoping for the arrival of my <HI>family;</HI> but my im|petuo&s;ity had blinded me to the imprudence of which I was guilty in quitting Scotland &s;o ha&s;tily. My wounded father, after his recovery, relap&s;ed; and when I had waited in the mo&s;t comfortle&s;s &s;i|tuation for &s;ix weeks, my friend wrote me word, that the journey was yet deferred for &s;ome time longer.</P>
<P>My finances were then nearly exhau&s;ted, and I was obliged, though mo&s;t unwillingly, to beg fur|ther a&s;&s;i&s;tance from my mother, that I might re|turn
<PB N="35" REF="34">
to Scotland. Oh! Madam!&mdash;my an&s;wer was not from her&s;elf,&mdash;it was written by a lady who had long been her companion, and acquainted me that &s;he had been taken &s;uddenly ill of a fever,&mdash;and was no more!</P>
<P>The compa&s;&s;ionate nature of which you have given &s;uch noble proofs, a&s;&s;ures me I need not, if I could, paint to you the angui&s;h of a mind over|whelmed with &s;uch accumulated &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed was a letter to a near relation which &s;he had, during her illne&s;s, with much difficulty, written, and in which, with the &s;tronge&s;t mater|nal tenderne&s;s, &s;he de&s;cribed my deplorable &s;ituati|on, and entreated his intere&s;t to procure me &s;ome preferment. Yet &s;o &s;unk was I by misfortune, that a fortnight elap&s;ed ere I had the courage or &s;pirit to attempt delivering this letter. I was then compelled to it by want. To make my appear|ance with &s;ome decency, I was nece&s;&s;itated, my|&s;elf, to the melancholy ta&s;k of changing my co|loured cloaths for a &s;uit of mourning;&mdash;and then I proceeded to &s;eek my relation.</P>
<P>I was informed that he was not in town.</P>
<P>In this de&s;perate &s;ituation, the pride of my heart, which hitherto had not bowed to adver&s;ity, gave way, and I determined to entreat the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of my friend, who&s;e offered &s;ervices I had a thou&s;and times rejected. Yet, Madam, &s;o hard is it to root from the mind its favourite princi|ples, or prejudices, call them which you plea&s;e, that I lingered another week ere I had the re&s;olu|tion to &s;end away a letter which I regarded as the death of my independence.</P>
<P>At length, reduced to my la&s;t &s;hilling, dunned in&s;olently by the people of the hou&s;e, and almo&s;t fami&s;hed, I &s;ealed this fatal letter, and, with a heavy heart, determined to take it to the po&s;t-office.
<PB N="36" REF="35">
But Mr. Branghton and his &s;on &s;uffered me not to pa&s;s through their &s;hop with impunity; they in&s;ulted me gro&s;sly, and threatened me with im|pri&s;onment, if I did not immediately &s;atisfy their demands. Stung to the &s;oul, I bid them have but a day's patience, and flung from them, in a &s;tate of mind too terrible for de&s;cription.</P>
<P>My letter, which I now found would be receiv|ed too late to &s;ave me from di&s;grace, I tore into a thou&s;and pieces, and &s;carce could I refrain from put|ting an in&s;tantaneous, an unlicen&s;ed period to my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>In this di&s;order of my &s;en&s;es, I formed the hor|rible plan of turning foot-pad; for which purpo&s;e I returned to my lodging, and collected whatever of my apparel I could part with, which I immediately &s;old, and with the profits purcha&s;ed a brace of pi&s;|tols, powder and &s;hot. I hope, however, you will believe me, when I mo&s;t &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, my &s;ole intention was to <HI>frighten</HI> the pa&s;&s;engers I &s;hould a&s;&s;ault, with the&s;e dangerous weapons, which I had not loaded, but from a re&s;olution,&mdash;a dreadful one, I own,&mdash;to &s;ave <HI>my&s;elf</HI> from an ig|nominious death if &s;eized. And, indeed, I thought if I could but procure money &s;ufficient to pay Mr. Branghton, and make a journey to Scotland, I &s;hould &s;oon be able, by the public papers, to di&s;|cover whom I had injured, and to make private retribution.</P>
<P>But, Madam, new to every &s;pecies of villany, my perturbation was &s;o great that I could with dif|ficulty &s;upport my&s;elf: yet the Branghtons ob&s;erv|ed it not as I pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;hop.</P>
<P>Here I &s;top: what followed is better known to your&s;elf. But no time can ever efface from my memory that moment, when in the very action of preparing for my own de&s;truction, or the lawle&s;s
<PB N="37" REF="36">
&s;eizure of the property of others, you ru&s;hed in|to the room, and arre&s;ted my arm!&mdash;It was, in|deed, an awful moment!&mdash;the hand of Providence &s;eemed to intervene between me and eternity; I beheld you as an angel!&mdash;I thought you dropt from the clouds;&mdash;the earth, indeed, had never before pre&s;ented to my view a form &s;o cele&s;tial!&mdash;What wonder, then, that a &s;pectacle &s;o a&s;toni&s;h|ing &s;hould, to a man di&s;ordered as I was, appear too beautiful to be human?</P>
<P>And now, Madam, that I have performed this painful ta&s;k, the more grateful one remains of re|warding, as far as is in my power, your generous goodne&s;s, by a&s;&s;uring you it &s;hall not be thrown away. You have awakened me to a &s;en&s;e of the fal&s;e pride by which I have been actuated,&mdash;a pride which, while it &s;corned a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a friend, &s;crupled not to compel it from a &s;tranger, though at the hazard of reducing that &s;tranger to a &s;ituation as de&s;titute as my own. Yet, Oh! how violent was the &s;truggle which tore my con|flicting &s;oul, ere I could per&s;uade my&s;elf to profit by the benevolence which you were &s;o evidently di&s;po&s;ed to exert in my favour!</P>
<P>By means of a ring, the gift of my much-re|gretted mother, I have for the pre&s;ent &s;atisfied Mr. Branghton; and by means of your compa&s;&s;ion, I hope to &s;upport my&s;elf, either till I hear from my friend, to whom, at length, I have written, or till the relation of my mother returns to town.</P>
<P>To talk to you, Madam, of paying my debt, would be vain; I never can! the &s;ervice you have done me exceeds all power of return; you have re&s;tored me to my &s;en&s;es, you have taught me to curb tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which bereft me of them, and, &s;ince I cannot avoid calamity, to bear it as a man! An interpo&s;ition &s;o wonderfully circum&s;tanced can
<PB N="38" REF="37">
never be recollected without benefit. Yet allow me to &s;ay, the pecuniary part of my obligation mu&s;t be &s;ettled by my fir&s;t ability.</P>

<P>O SIR, what an adventure have I to write!&mdash;all night it has occupied my thoughts, and I am now ri&s;en thus early, to write it to you.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday it was &s;ettled that we &s;hould &s;pend the evening in Marybone-gardens, where M. Torre, a celebrated foreigner, was to exhibit &s;ome fireworks. The party con&s;i&s;ted of Madame Du|val, all the Branghtons, M. Du Bois, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Brown.</P>
<P>We were almo&s;t the fir&s;t per&s;ons who entered the Gardens, Mr. Branghton having declared he would have <HI>all he could get for his money,</HI> which, at be&s;t, was only fooled away, at &s;uch &s;illy and idle places.</P>
<P>We walked in parties, and very much detached from one another; Mr. Brown and Mi&s;s Polly led the way by them&s;elves; Mi&s;s Branghton and Mr. Smith followed, and the latter &s;eemed determined to be revenged for my behaviour at the ball, by transferring all his former attention for me, to Mi&s;s Branghton, who received it with an air of exulta|tion:

and very frequently they each of them, though from different motives, looked back, to di&s;cover whether I ob&s;erved their good intelligence. Madame Duval walked with M. Du Bois; and Mr. Branghton by him&s;elf; but his &s;on would wil|lingly have attached him&s;elf wholly to me, &s;aying frequently, <Q REND="inline">"Come, Mi&s;s, let's you and I have a little fun together; you &s;ee they have all left us, &s;o now let us leave them."</Q> But I begged to be excu&s;ed, and went to the other &s;ide of Madame Duval.</P>
<P>This Garden, as it is called, is neither &s;triking for magnificence nor for beauty; and we were all &s;o dull and languid, that I was extremely glad when we were &s;ummoned to the orche&s;tra, upon the opening of a concert; in the cour&s;e of which, I had the plea&s;ure of hearing a concerto on the violin by Mr. Barthelemon, who, to me, &s;eems a player of exqui&s;ite fancy, feeling, and variety.</P>
<P>When notice was given us, that the fire-works were preparing, we hurried along to &s;ecure good places for the &s;ight: but, very &s;oon, we were &s;o encircled and incommoded by the crowd, that Mr. Smith propo&s;ed the <HI>ladies</HI> &s;hould make intere&s;t for a form to &s;tand upon; this was &s;oon effected, and the men then left us, to accommodate them&s;elves better, &s;aying they would return the moment the exhibition was over.</P>
<P>The firework was really beautiful, and told, with wonderful ingenuity, the &s;tory of Orpheus and Eurydice: but, at the moment of the fatal look, which &s;eparated them for ever, there was &s;uch an explo&s;ion of fire, and &s;o horrible a noi&s;e, that we all, as of one accord, jumpt ha&s;tily from the form, and ran away &s;ome paces, fearing that we were in danger of mi&s;chief, from the innume|rable &s;parks of fire which glittered in the air.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
For a moment or two, I neither knew nor con|&s;idered whither I had run; but my recollection was &s;oon awakened by a &s;tranger's addre&s;&s;ing me with, <Q REND="inline">"Come along with me, my dear, and I'll take care of you."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tarted, and then, to my great terror, per|ceived that I had out-run all my companions, and &s;aw not one human being I knew! with all the &s;peed in my power, and forgetful of my fir&s;t fright, I ha&s;tened back to the place I had left;&mdash;but found the form occupied by a new &s;et of people.</P>
<P>In vain, from &s;ide to &s;ide, I looked for &s;ome face I knew; I found my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a crowd, yet without party, friend, or acquain|tance. I walked, in di&s;ordered ha&s;te, from place to place, without knowing which way to turn, or whither I went. Every other moment, I was &s;poken to, by &s;ome bold and unfeeling man, to whom my di&s;tre&s;s, which, I think, mu&s;t be very apparent, only furni&s;hed a pretence for impertinent wittici&s;ms, or free gallantry.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, a young officer, marching fiercely up to me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are a &s;weet pretty creature, and I enli&s;t you in my &s;ervice;"</Q> and then, with great violence, he &s;eized my hand. I &s;creamed aloud with fear, and, forcibly &s;natching it away, I ran ha&s;tily up to two ladies, and cried, <Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, dear ladies, afford me &s;ome pro|tection!"</Q></P>
<P>They heard me with a loud laugh, but very readily &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ay, let her walk between us;"</Q> and each of them took hold of an arm.</P>
<P>Then, in a drawling, ironical tone of voice, they a&s;ked <HI>what had frightened my little Lady&s;hip?</HI> I told them my adventure very &s;imply, and en|treated
<PB N="41" REF="40">
they would have the goodne&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in finding my friends.</P>
<P>O yes, to be &s;ure, they &s;aid, I &s;hould not want for friends, whil&s;t I was with them. Mine, I &s;aid, would be very grateful for any civilities with which they might favour me. But imagine, my dear Sir, how I mu&s;t be confounded, when I ob&s;erved, that every other word I &s;poke produced a loud laugh! However, I will not dwell upon a conver&s;ation, which &s;oon, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible horror, convinced me I had &s;ought protection from in&s;ult, of tho&s;e who were them&s;elves mo&s;t likely to offer it! You, my deare&s;t Sir, I well know, will both feel for, and pity my terror, which I have no words to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Had I been at liberty, I &s;hould have in&s;tantly run away from them, when I made the &s;hocking di&s;covery; but, as they held me fa&s;t, that was utterly impo&s;&s;ible: and &s;uch was my dread of their re&s;entment or abu&s;e, that I did not dare to make any open attempt to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>They a&s;ked me a thou&s;and que&s;tions, accom|panied by as many  hallows, of who I was, what I was, and whence I came. My an&s;wers were very incoherent,&mdash;but what, good Heaven! were my emotions, when a few moments afterwards, I perceived advancing our way, Lord Orville!</P>
<P>Never &s;hall I forget what I felt at that in&s;tant: had I, indeed, been &s;unk to the guilty &s;tate, which &s;uch companions might lead him to &s;u&s;pect, I could &s;carce have had feelings more cruelly de|pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>However, to my infinite joy, he pa&s;&s;ed us without di&s;tingui&s;hing me; though I &s;aw that, in a carele&s;s manner, his eyes &s;urveyed the party,</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, one of the&s;e unhappy women &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Do you know that young fellow?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">
Not thinking it po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould mean Lord Orville by &s;uch a term, I readily an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">""No, Madam."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you have a mon&s;trous good &s;tare, for a little country Mi&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>I now found I had mi&s;taken her, but was glad to avoid an explanation.</P>
<P>A few minutes after, what was my delight, to hear the voice of Mr. Brown, who called out, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, i'n't that Mi&s;s what's her name?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thank God,"</Q> cried I, &s;uddenly &s;pringing from them both, <Q REND="inline">"thank God, I have found my party!</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Brown, was, however, alone, and, with|out knowing what I did, I took hold of his arm.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Mi&s;s, cried he, we've had &s;uch a hunt you can't think! &s;ome of them thought you was gone home; but I &s;ays, &s;ays I, I don't think &s;ays I, that &s;he'll like to go home all alone, &s;ays I."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So that gentleman belongs to you, Mi&s;s, does he?"</Q> &s;aid one of the women.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Yes, Madam,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"and I now thank you for your civility; but as I am &s;afe, will not give you any further trouble."</Q></P>
<P>I court&s;ied &s;lightly, and would have walked away; but, mo&s;t unfortunately, Madame Du|val and the two Mi&s;s Branghtons ju&s;t then joined us.</P>
<P>They all began to make a thou&s;and enquiries, to which I briefly an&s;wered, that I had been obliged to the&s;e two ladies for walking with me, and would tell them more another time: for, though I felt great <HI>comparative</HI> courage, I was yet too much intimidated by their pre&s;ence, to dare be explicit.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">
Neverthele&s;s, I ventured, once more, to wi&s;h them good night, and propo&s;ed &s;eeking Mr. Branghton. The&s;e unhappy women li&s;tened to all that was &s;aid with a kind of callous curio&s;ity, and &s;eemed determined not to take any hint. But my vexation was terribly augmented, when, after having whi&s;pered &s;omething to each other, they very cavalierly declared, that they intended join|ing our party! and then, one of them, very bold|ly took hold of my arm, while the other, going round, &s;eized that of Mr. Brown; and thus, al|mo&s;t forcibly, we were moved on between them, and followed by Madame Duval and the Mi&s;s Branghtons.</P>
<P>It would be very difficult to &s;ay which was greate&s;t, my fright, or Mr. Brown's con&s;ternati|on; who ventured not to make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t|ance, though his unea&s;ine&s;s made him tremble al|mo&s;t as much as my&s;elf. I would in&s;tantly have withdrawn my arm; but it was held &s;o tight, I could not move it; and poor Mr. Brown was cir|cum&s;tanced in the &s;ame manner on the other &s;ide; for I heard him &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Ma'am, there's no need to &s;queeze one's arm &s;o!"</Q></P>
<P>And this was our &s;ituation,&mdash;for we had not taken three &s;teps, when,&mdash;O Sir,&mdash;we again met Lord Orville!&mdash;but not again did he pa&s;s quietly by us,&mdash;unhappily I caught his eye;&mdash;both mine, immediately, were bent to the ground; but he approached me, and we all &s;topped.</P>
<P>I then looked up. He bowed. Good God, with what expre&s;&s;ive eyes did he regard me! Ne|ver were &s;urpri&s;e and concern &s;o &s;trongly marked,&mdash;yes, my dear Sir, he looked <HI>greatly</HI> concerned; and that, the remembrance of that, is the only con&s;olation I feel, for an evening the mo&s;t pain|ful of my life.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
What he fir&s;t &s;aid, I know not; for, indeed, I &s;eemed to have neither ears nor under&s;tanding; but I recollect that I only court&s;ied in &s;ilence. He pau&s;ed for an in&s;tant, as if&mdash;I believe &s;o,&mdash;as if unwilling to pa&s;s on; but then, finding the whole party detained, he again bowed, and took leave.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Sir, I thought I &s;hould have fainted, &s;o great was my emotion from &s;hame, vexation, and a thou&s;and other feelings, for which I have no expre&s;&s;ions. I ab&s;olutely tore my&s;elf from the woman's arm, and then, di&s;engaging my&s;elf from that of Mr. Brown, I went to Ma|dame Duval, and be&s;ought that &s;he would not &s;uf|fer me to be again parted from her.</P>
<P>I fancy&mdash;that Lord Orville &s;aw what pa&s;&s;ed; for &s;carcely was I at liberty, ere he returned. Methought, my dear Sir, the plea&s;ure, the &s;ur|pri&s;e of that moment, recompen&s;ed me for all the chagrin I had before felt: for do you not think, that this return, manife&s;ts, from a character &s;o quiet, &s;o re&s;erved as Lord Orville's, &s;omething like &s;olicitude in my concerns?&mdash;&s;uch at lea&s;t, was the interpretation I involuntarily made upon again &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>With a politene&s;s to which I have been &s;ome time very little u&s;ed, he apologi&s;ed for returning, and then enquired after the health of Mrs. Mirvan, and the re&s;t of the Howard Grove family. The flattering conjecture which I have ju&s;t acknow|ledged, had &s;o wonderfully re&s;tored my &s;pirits, that I believe I never an&s;wered him &s;o readily, and with &s;o little con&s;traint. Very &s;hort, however, was the duration of this conver&s;ation: for we were &s;oon mo&s;t di&s;agreeably interrupted.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;s Branghtons, though they &s;aw almo&s;t immediately the characters of the women to whom I had &s;o unfortunately applied, were, never|thele&s;s,
<PB N="45" REF="44">
&s;o weak and fooli&s;h, as merely to <HI>titter</HI> at their behaviour. As to Madame Duval, &s;he was really for &s;ome time &s;o &s;trangely impo&s;ed upon, that &s;he thought they were two real fine ladies. Indeed it is wonderful to &s;ee how ea&s;ily and how frequently &s;he is deceived: our di&s;turb|ance, however, aro&s;e from young Brown, who was now between the two women, by whom his arms were ab&s;olutely pinioned to his &s;ides: for a few minutes, his complaints had been only mur|mured; but he now called out aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Good|ne&s;s, Ladies, you hurt me like any thing! why I can't walk at all, if you keep pinching my arms &s;o!"</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech rai&s;ed a loud laugh in the women, and redoubled the tittering of the Mi&s;s Brangh|ton's. For my own part, I was mo&s;t cruelly con|fu&s;ed; while the countenance of Lord Orville manife&s;ted a &s;ort of indignant a&s;toni&s;hment; and, from that moment, he &s;poke to me no more, till he took leave.</P>
<P>Madame Duval who now began to &s;u&s;pect her company, propo&s;ed our taking the fir&s;t box we &s;aw empty, be&s;peaking a &s;upper, and waiting till Mr. Branghton &s;hould find us.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Polly mentioned one &s;he had remarked, to which we all turned; Madame Duval in&s;tantly &s;eated her&s;elf; and the two bold women, forcing the frightened Mr. Brown to go between them, fol|lowed her example.</P>
<P>Lord Orville, with an air of gravity that wound|ed my very &s;oul, then wi&s;hed me good night. I &s;aid not a word; but my face, if it had any con|nection with my heart, mu&s;t have looked melan|choly indeed: and &s;o, I have &s;ome rea&s;on to be|lieve, it did; for he added, with much more &s;oft|ne&s;s, though not le&s;s dignity, <Q REND="inline">"Will Mi&s;s Anville
<PB N="46" REF="45">
allow me to a&s;k her addre&s;s, and to pay my re|&s;pects to her before I leave town?"</Q></P>
<P>O how I changed colour at this unexpected re|que&s;t!&mdash;yet what was the mortification I &s;uffered, in an&s;wering, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord, I am&mdash;in Holborn!"</Q></P>
<P>He then bowed and left us.</P>
<P>What, what can he think of this adventure! how &s;trangely, how cruelly have all appearances turned again&s;t me! Had I been ble&s;&s;ed with any pre&s;ence of mind, I &s;hould in&s;tantly have explain|ed to him the accident which occa&s;ioned my being in &s;uch terrible company;&mdash;but I have none!</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t of the evening, I cannot relate the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed; for, to you, I only write of what I think, and I can think of nothing but this unfortunate, this di&s;graceful meeting. The&s;e two poor women continued to torment us all, but e&s;pecially poor Mr. Brown, who &s;eemed to afford them uncommon diver&s;ion, till we were di&s;covered by Mr. Branghton, who very &s;oon found means to relea&s;e us from their per&s;ecutions, by frightening them away. We &s;tayed but a &s;hort time after they left us, which was all employed in explanations.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the con&s;truction which Lord Orville may put upon this affair, to me it cannot fail of being unfavourable; to be &s;een&mdash;gracious Heaven!&mdash;to be &s;een in company with two women of &s;uch character!&mdash;How vainly, how proudly have I wi&s;hed to avoid meeting him when only with the Branghtons and Madame Duval,&mdash;but now, how joyful &s;hould I be had he &s;een me to no greater di&s;advantage!&mdash;Holborn, too! what a di|rection!&mdash;he who had always&mdash;but I will not tor|ment you, my deare&s;t Sir, with any more of my mortifying conjectures and apprehen&s;ions: perhaps he may call,&mdash;and then I &s;hall have an opportunity
<PB N="47" REF="46">
of explaining to him all the mo&s;t &s;hocking part of the adventure. And yet, as I did not tell him at who&s;e hou&s;e I lived, he may not be able to di&s;co|ver me; I merely &s;aid <HI>in Holborn,</HI> and he, who I &s;uppo&s;e &s;aw my embarra&s;&s;ment, forbore to a&s;k any other direction.</P>
<P>Well, I mu&s;t take my chance!</P>
<P>Yet let me, in ju&s;tice to Lord Orville, and in ju&s;tice to the high opinion I have always enter|tained of his honour and delicacy,&mdash;let me ob&s;erve the difference of his behaviour, when nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation to that of Sir Clement Wil|loughby. He had at lea&s;t equal cau&s;e to depreci|ate me in his opinion, and to mortify and &s;ink me in my own: but far different was his conduct;&mdash;perplexed, indeed, he looked, and much &s;urpri&s;|ed,&mdash;but it was benevolently, not with in&s;olence. I am even inclined to think, that he could not &s;ee a young creature whom he had &s;o lately known in a higher &s;phere, appear &s;o &s;uddenly, &s;o &s;trangely, &s;o di&s;gracefully altered in her &s;ituation, without &s;ome pity and concern. But, whatever might be his doubts and &s;u&s;picions, far from &s;uffering them to influence his behaviour, he &s;poke, he looked, with the &s;ame politene&s;s and attention with which he had always honoured me when countenanced by Mrs. Mirvan.</P>
<P>Once again, let me drop this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In every mortification, every di&s;turbance, how grateful to my heart, how &s;weet to my recollecti|on, in the certainty of your never-failing tender|ne&s;s, &s;ympathy, and protection! Oh Sir, could I, upon this &s;ubject, could I write as I feel,&mdash;how animated would be the language of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Holborn, <DATE>July 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LISTLESS, unea&s;y, and without either &s;pirit or courage to employ my&s;elf, from the time I had fini&s;hed my la&s;t letter, I indolently &s;eated my&s;elf at the window, where, while I waited Madame Duval's &s;ummons to breakfa&s;t, I perceived, among the carriages which pa&s;&s;ed by, a coronet coach, and, in a few minutes, from the window of it, Lord Orville! I in&s;tantly retreated, but not, I believe, un&s;een; for the coach immediately drove up to our door.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Sir, I mu&s;t own I was greatly agitated; the idea of receiving Lord Orville by my&s;elf,&mdash;the knowledge that his vi&s;it was entirely to <HI>me,</HI>&mdash;the wi&s;h of explaining the unfortunate adventure of ye&s;terday,&mdash;and the mortification of my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances,&mdash;all the&s;e thoughts, oc|curring to me nearly at the &s;ame time, occa&s;ioned me more anxiety, confu&s;ion, and perplexity, than I can po&s;&s;ibly expre&s;s.</P>
<P>I believe he meant to &s;end up his name; but the maid, unu&s;ed to &s;uch a ceremony, forgot it by the way, and only told me, that a great Lord was below, and de&s;ired to &s;ee me: and, the next moment he appeared him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If formerly when in the circle of high life, and accu&s;tomed to its manners, I &s;o much admired and di&s;tingui&s;hed the grace, the elegance of Lord Orville, think, Sir, how they mu&s;t &s;trike me now,&mdash;now, when, far removed from that &s;plendid circle, I live with tho&s;e to whom even civility is unknown, and decorum a &s;tranger!</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48">
I am &s;ure I received him very awkwardly; de|pre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ituation &s;o di&s;agreeable, could I do otherwi&s;e? When his fir&s;t enquiries were made, <Q REND="inline">"I think my&s;elf very fortunate,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"in meeting with Mi&s;s Anville at home, and &s;till more &s;o, in finding her di&s;engaged."</Q></P>
<P>I only court&s;ied. He then talked of Mrs. Mir|van; a&s;ked how long I had been in town, and other &s;uch general que&s;tions, which, happily, gave me time to recover from my embarra&s;&s;ment. After which, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If Mi&s;s Anville will al|low me the honour of &s;itting by her a few minutes "(for we were both &s;tanding)" I will venture to tell her the motive which, next to enquiring after her health, has prompted me to wait on her thus early."</Q></P>
<P>We were then both &s;eated, and, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How to apologize for &s;o great a liberty as I am upon the point of taking, I know not; &s;hall I, therefore, rely wholly upon your goodne&s;s, and not apologize at all?"</Q></P>
<P>I only bowed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be extremely &s;orry to appear imper|tinent,&mdash;yet hardly know how to avoid it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impertinent! O my Lord,"</Q> cried I, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"that, I am &s;ure, is impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"and encourage me to be ingenuous&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Again he &s;topped; but my expectation was too great for &s;peech: at la&s;t, without looking at me, in a low voice and he&s;itating manner, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Were tho&s;e Ladies with whom I &s;aw you la&s;t night, ever in your company before?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, ri&s;ing, and colour|ing violently, <Q REND="inline">"nor will they ever be again."</Q></P>
<P>He ro&s;e too, and, with an air of the mo&s;t con|de&s;cending concern, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pardon, Madam, the
<PB N="50" REF="49">
abruptne&s;s of a que&s;tion which I knew not how to introduce as I ought, and for which I have no excu&s;e to offer, but my re&s;pect for Mrs. Mirvan, joined to the &s;incere&s;t wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s: yet I fear I have gone too far!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;en&s;ible of the honour of your Lord&s;hip's attention,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"but&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Permit me to a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> cried he, finding I he&s;itated, <Q REND="inline">"that officiou&s;ne&s;s is not my charac|teri&s;tic, and that I would by no means have ri&s;ked your di&s;plea&s;ure, had I not been fully &s;atisfied you were too generous to be offended, without a real cau&s;e of offence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Offended!"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">no, my Lord, I am on|ly grieved,&mdash;grieved, indeed! to find my&s;elf in a &s;ituation &s;o unfortunate, as to be obliged to make explanations which cannot but mortify and &s;hock me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is I alone,"</Q> cried he, with &s;ome eagerne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"who am &s;hocked, as it is I who de&s;erve to be mortified; I &s;eek no explanation, for I have no doubt; but, in mi&s;taking me, Mi&s;s Anville in|jures her&s;elf: allow me, therefore, frankly and openly to tell you the intention of my vi&s;it."</Q></P>
<P>I bowed, and we both returned to our &s;eats.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will own my&s;elf to have been greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"when I met you ye&s;|terday evening, in company with two per&s;ons who I was &s;en&s;ible merited not the honour of your notice; nor was it ea&s;y for me to conjec|ture the cau&s;e of your being &s;o &s;ituated; yet, be|lieve me, my incertitude did not for a moment do you injury; I was &s;atisfied that their characters mu&s;t be unknown to you, and I thought with con|cern of the &s;hock you would &s;u&s;tain, when you di&s;covered their unworthine&s;s. I &s;hould not, however, upon &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance, have

u&s;urped the privilege of intimacy, in giving my una&s;ked &s;entiments upon &s;o delicate a &s;ubject, had I not known that credulity is the &s;i&s;ter of in|nocence, and therefore feared you might be de|ceived. A &s;omething, which I could not re&s;i&s;t, urged me to the freedom I have taken to caution you; but I &s;hall not ea&s;ily forgive my&s;elf, if I have been &s;o unfortunate as to give you pain."</Q></P>
<P>The pride which his fir&s;t que&s;tion had excited, now &s;ub&s;ided into delight and gratitude, and I in|&s;tantly related to him, as well as I could, the accident which had occa&s;ioned my joining the un|happy women with whom he had met me. He li&s;tened with an attention &s;o flattering, &s;eemed &s;o much intere&s;ted during the recital, and, when I had done, thanked me, in terms &s;o polite, for what he was plea&s;ed to call my conde&s;cen&s;ion, that I was almo&s;t a&s;hamed either to look at, or hear him.</P>
<P>Soon after, the maid came to tell me, that Madame Duval de&s;ired to have breakfa&s;t made in her own room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fear,"</Q> cried Lord Orville, in&s;tantly ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"that I have intruded upon your time,&mdash;yet who, &s;o &s;ituated, could do otherwi&s;e?"</Q> Then, taking my hand, <Q REND="inline">"Will Mi&s;s Anville allow me thus to &s;eal my peace?"</Q> He pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, and took leave.</P>
<P>Generous, noble Lord Orville! how di&s;inte|re&s;ted his conduct! how delicate his whole beha|viour! willing to advi&s;e, yet afraid to wound me!&mdash;Can I ever, in future, regret the adventure I met with at Marybone, &s;ince it has been product|ive of a vi&s;it &s;o flattering? Had my mortificati|ons been &s;till more humiliating, my terrors &s;till more alarming, &s;uch a mark of e&s;teem&mdash;may I
<PB N="52" REF="51">
not call it &s;o?&mdash;from Lord Orville, would have made me ample amends.</P>
<P>And indeed, my dear Sir, I require &s;ome con|&s;olation in my pre&s;ent very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation; for, &s;ince he went, two incidents have happened, that, had not my &s;pirits been particularly elated, would greatly have di&s;concerted me.</P>
<P>During breakfa&s;t, Madame Duval, very abrupt|ly, a&s;ked if I &s;hould like to be married? and ad|ded, that Mr. Branghton had been propo&s;ing a match for me with his &s;on. Surpri&s;ed, and, I mu&s;t own, provoked, I a&s;&s;ured her that, in think|ing of me, Mr. Branghton would very vainly lo&s;e his time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I have had grander views for you, my&s;elf, if once I could get you to Paris, and make you be owned; but, if I can't do that, and you can do no better, why, as you are both my relations, I think to leave my fortune between you, and then, if you marry, you never need want for nothing."</Q></P>
<P>I begged her not to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject, as, I a&s;&s;ured her, Mr. Branghton was totally di&s;agree|able to me: but &s;he continued her admonitions and reflections, with her u&s;ual di&s;regard of what|ever I could an&s;wer. She charged me, very pe|remptorily, neither wholly to di&s;courage, nor yet to accept Mr. Branghton's offer, till &s;he &s;aw what could be done for me: the young man, &s;he ad|ded, had often intended to &s;peak to me him&s;elf, but, not well knowing how to introduce the &s;ub|ject, he had de&s;ired her to pave the way for him.</P>
<P>I &s;crupled not, warmly and freely to declare my aver&s;ion to this propo&s;al; but it was to no effect, as &s;he concluded, ju&s;t as &s;he had begun, by &s;aying, that I &s;hould not <HI>have him, if I could do better.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="52">
Nothing, however, &s;hall per&s;uade me to li&s;ten to any other per&s;on concerning this odious affair.</P>
<P>My &s;econd cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es, very un|expectedly, from M. Du Bois, who, to my infi|nite &s;urpri&s;e, upon Madame Duval's quitting the room after dinner, put into my hand a note, and immediately left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This note contains an open declaration of an attachment to me, which, he &s;ays, he &s;hould ne|ver have pre&s;umed to have acknowledged, had he not been informed that Madame Duval de&s;tined my hand to young Branghton,&mdash;a match which he cannot endure to think of. He be&s;eeches me, earne&s;tly, to pardon his temerity, profe&s;&s;es the mo&s;t inviolable re&s;pect, and commits his fate to time, patience, and pity.</P>
<P>This conduct in M. Du Bois gives me real con|cern, as I was di&s;po&s;ed to think very well of him. It will not, however, be difficult to di&s;courage him, and therefore I &s;hall not acquaint Madame Duval of his letter, as I have rea&s;on to believe it would greatly di&s;plea&s;e her.</P>

<P>O SIR, how much unea&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t I &s;uffer, to counterbalance one &s;hort morning of happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, the Branghtons propo&s;ed a party to Ken&s;ington-gardens, and, as u&s;ual, Madame Du|val in&s;i&s;ted upon my attendance.</P>
<P>We went in a hackney-coach to Piccadilly, and then had a walk through Hyde Park, which in any other company, would have been delightful. I
<PB N="54" REF="53">
was much plea&s;ed with Ken&s;ington-gardens, and think them infinitely preferable to tho&s;e of Vauxhall.</P>
<P>Young Branghton was extremely trouble&s;ome; he in&s;i&s;ted upon walking by my &s;ide, and talked with me almo&s;t by compul&s;ion: however, my re|&s;erve and coldne&s;s prevented his entering upon the hateful &s;ubject which Madame Duval had prepa|red me to apprehend. Once, indeed, when I was, accidentally, a few yards before the re&s;t, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Mi&s;s, aunt has told you about you know what?&mdash;ha'n't &s;he, Mi&s;s?"</Q>&mdash;But I turned from him without making any an&s;wer. Neither Mr. Smith nor Mr. Brown were of the party; and poor M. Du Bois, when he found that I avoided him, looked &s;o melancholy, that I was really &s;orry for him.</P>
<P>While we were &s;trolling round the garden, I perceived, walking with a party of ladies at &s;ome di&s;tance, Lord Orville! I in&s;tantly retreated be|hind Mi&s;s Branghton, and kept out of &s;ight till we had pa&s;&s;ed him: for I dreaded being &s;een by him again, in a public walk, with a party of which I was a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>Happily I &s;ucceeded in my de&s;ign, and &s;aw no more of him; for a &s;udden and violent &s;hower of rain made us all ha&s;ten out of the gardens. We ran till we came to a &s;mall green-&s;hop, where we begged &s;helter. Here we found our&s;elves in com|pany with two footmen, whom the rain had dri|ven into the &s;hop. Their livery, I thought, I had before &s;een; and upon looking from the window, I perceived the &s;ame upon a coachman belonging to a carriage, which I immediately recollected to be Lord Orville's.</P>
<P>Fearing to be known, I whi&s;pered Mi&s;s Brangh|ton not to &s;peak my name. Had I con&s;idered but
<PB N="55" REF="54">
a moment, I &s;hould have been &s;en&s;ible of the in|utility of &s;uch a caution, &s;ince not one of the party call me by any other appellation than that of <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI> or of <HI>Mi&s;s;</HI> but I am perpetually in|volved in &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s or dilemma from my own heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t excited very &s;trongly her curio&s;i|ty; and &s;he attacked me with &s;uch eagerne&s;s and bluntne&s;s of enquiry, that I could not avoid telling her the rea&s;on of my making it, and, con&s;equent|ly, that I was known to Lord Orville: an acknow|ledgment which proved the mo&s;t unfortunate in the world; for &s;he would not re&s;t till &s;he had drawn from me the circum&s;tances attending my fir&s;t making the acquaintance. Then, calling to her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Polly only think! Mi&s;s has danced with a Lord!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried Polly, <Q REND="inline">"that's a thing I &s;hould never have thought of! And pray, Mi&s;s, what did he &s;ay to you?"</Q></P>
<P>This que&s;tion was much &s;ooner a&s;ked than an|&s;wered; and they both became &s;o very inqui&s;itive and earne&s;t, that they &s;oon drew the attention of Madame Duval and the re&s;t of the party, to whom, in a very &s;hort time, they repeated all they had gathered from me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Goodne&s;s, then,"</Q> cried young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"if I was Mi&s;s, if I would not make free with his Lord&s;hip's coach to take me to town."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why ay,"</Q> &s;aid the father, <Q REND="inline">"there would be &s;ome &s;en&s;e in that; that would be making &s;ome u&s;e of a Lord's acquaintance, for it would &s;ave us coach-hire."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Mi&s;s,"</Q> cried Polly, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h you would, for I &s;hould like of all things to ride in a coronet coach!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="55">
<Q REND="inline">"I promi&s;e you,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"I'm glad you've thought of it, for I don't &s;ee no ob|jection;&mdash;&s;o let's have the coach-man called."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not for the world,"</Q> cried I, very much alarmed, <Q REND="inline">"indeed it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o?"</Q> demanded Mr. Branghton; <Q REND="inline">"pray where's the good of your knowing a Lord, if you're never the better for him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ma foi,</HI> child,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"you don't know no more of the world than if you was a baby. Pray, Sir, (to one of the footmen,) tell that coachman to draw up, for I wants to &s;peak to him."</Q></P>
<P>The man &s;tared, but did not move. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, pray, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"pray, Mr. Branghton, have the goodne&s;s to give up this plan; I know but very little of his Lord&s;hip, and cannot, upon any account, take &s;o great a liberty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't &s;ay nothing about it,"</Q> &s;aid Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;hall have it my own way: &s;o if <HI>you</HI> won't call the coachman, Sir, I'll promi&s;e you I'll call him my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>The footman, very impertinently, laughed and turned upon his heel. Madame Duval, extremely irritated, ran out in the rain, and beckoned the coachman, who in&s;tantly obeyed her &s;ummons. Shocked beyond all expre&s;&s;ion, I flew after her, and entreated her with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, to let us return in a hackney-coach:&mdash;but oh!&mdash;&s;he is impenetrable to per&s;ua&s;ion! She told the man &s;he wanted him to carry her directly to town, and that &s;he would an&s;wer for him to Lord Orville. The man, with a &s;neer, thanked her, but &s;aid he &s;hould an&s;wer for him&s;elf; and was driving off, when another footman came up to him, with informati|on that his Lord was gone into Ken&s;ington palace, and would not want him for an hour or two.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="56">
<Q REND="inline">"Why then, friend,</Q> "&s;aid Mr. Branghton, (for we were followed by all the party) <Q REND="inline">"where will be the great harm of your taking us to town?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be&s;ides,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I'll promi&s;e you a pot of beer for my own &s;hare."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peeches had no other an&s;wer from the coachman than a loud laugh, which was echoed by the in&s;olent footmen. I rejoiced at their re|&s;i&s;tance, though I was certain, that if their Lord had witne&s;&s;ed their impertinence, they would have been in&s;tantly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pardie,</HI>"</Q> cried Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"if I don't think all the footmen are the mo&s;t impu|dente&s;t fellows in the kingdom! But I'll promi&s;e you I'll have your ma&s;ter told of your airs, &s;o you'll get no good by 'em."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why pray,"</Q> &s;aid the coachman, rather alarmed, <Q REND="inline">"did my Lord give you leave to u&s;e the coach?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It's no matter for that,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;ure if he's a gentleman he'd let us have it &s;ooner than we &s;hould be wet to the &s;kin: but I'll promi&s;e you he &s;hall know how &s;aucy you've been, for this young lady knows him very well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, that &s;he does,"</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly; <Q REND="inline">"and &s;he's danced with him too.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh how I repented my fooli&s;h mi&s;ma|nagement! The men bit their lips, and looked at one another in &s;ome confu&s;ion. This was per|ceived by our party, who, taking advantage of it, prote&s;ted they would write Lord Orville word of their ill behaviour without delay. This quite &s;tartled them, and one of the footmen offered to run to the palace, and a&s;k his Lord's permi&s;&s;ion for our having the carriage.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al really made me tremble; and the Branghtons all hung back upon it: but Madame
<PB N="58" REF="57">
Duval is never to be di&s;&s;uaded from a &s;cheme &s;he has once formed. <Q REND="inline">"Do &s;o,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"and give this child's compliments to your Ma&s;ter, and tell him, as we ha'n't no coach here, we &s;hould be glad to go ju&s;t as far as Holborn in his."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, no,!"</Q> cried I; <Q REND="inline">"don't go,&mdash;I know nothing of his Lord&s;hip,&mdash;I &s;end no me&s;|&s;age,&mdash;I have nothing to &s;ay to him!"</Q></P>
<P>The men, very much perplexed, could with difficulty re&s;train them&s;elves from re&s;uming their impertinent mirth. Madame Duval &s;colded me very angrily, and then de&s;ired them to go direct|ly, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, then,"</Q> &s;aid the coachman, <Q REND="inline">"what name is to be given to my Lord?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Anville,"</Q> an&s;wered Madame Duval, <Q REND="inline">"tell him Mi&s;s Anville wants the coach; the young la|dy he danced with once."</Q></P>
<P>I was really in an agony: but the winds could not have been more deaf to me, than tho&s;e to whom I pleaded! and therefore the footman, urg|ed by the repeated threats of Madame Duval, and perhaps recollecting the name him&s;elf, actu|ally went to the palace with this &s;trange me&s;&s;age!</P>
<P>He returned in a few minutes, and bowing to me with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord de&s;ires his compliments, and his carriage will be always at Mi&s;s Anville's &s;ervice."</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;o much affected by this politene&s;s, and chagrined at the whole affair, that I could &s;carce refrain from tears. Madame Duval and the Mi&s;s Branghtons eagerly jumped into the coach, and de&s;ired me to follow. I would rather have &s;ub|mitted to the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment;&mdash;but all re&s;i&s;t|ance was vain.</P>
<P>During the whole ride, I &s;aid not a word; how|ever, the re&s;t of the party were &s;o talkative, that my &s;ilence was very immaterial. We &s;topped
<PB N="59" REF="58">
at our lodgings; but when Madame Duval and I alighted, the Branghtons a&s;ked if they could not be carried on to Snow-Hill? The &s;ervants, now all civility, made no objection. Remon&s;trances from me, would, I too well kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">w, be fruitle&s;s; and therefore, with a heavy heart, I retired to my room, and left them to their own direction.</P>
<P>Seldom have I pa&s;&s;ed a night in greater unea&s;i|ne&s;s:&mdash;&s;o lately to have cleared my&s;elf in the good opinion of Lord Orville,&mdash;&s;o &s;oon to forfeit it!&mdash;to give him rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e I pre&s;umed to boa&s;t of his acquaintance,&mdash;to publi&s;h his having danced with me!&mdash;to take with him a liberty I &s;hould have blu&s;hed to have taken with the mo&s;t intimate of my friends!&mdash;to treat with &s;uch im|pertinent freedom one who has honoured <HI>me</HI> with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed re&s;pect!&mdash;indeed, Sir, I could have met with no accident that would &s;o cruelly have tormented me!</P>
<P>If &s;uch were, then, my feelings, imagine,&mdash;for I cannot de&s;cribe, what I &s;uffered during the &s;cene I am now going to write.</P>
<P>This morning, while I was alone in the dining|room, young Branghton called. He entered with a mo&s;t important air, and &s;trutting up to me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s, <HI>Lord Orville</HI> &s;ends his compliments to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Orville!"</Q>&mdash;repeated I, much amazed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Mi&s;s, Lord Orville; for <HI>I</HI> know his Lord&s;hip now, as well as you,&mdash;And a very civil gentleman he is, for all he's a Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"explain your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why you mu&s;t know, Mi&s;s, after we le&s;t you, we met with a little misfortune; but I don't mind it now, for it's all turned out for the be&s;t: but, ju&s;t as we were a going up Snow-Hill, plump
<PB N="60" REF="59">
we comes again&s;t a cart, with &s;uch a jog it almo&s;t pulled the coach-wheel off; however, that i'n't the wor&s;t, for as I went to open the door in a hurry, a thinking the coach would be broke down, as ill-luck would have it, I never minded that the gla&s;s was up, and &s;o I poked my head fairly through it. Only &s;ee, Mi&s;s, how I've cut my forehead!"</Q></P>
<P>A much wor&s;e accident to him&s;elf, would not I believe, at that moment, have given me any concern for him: however, he proceeded with his account, for I was too much confounded to in|terrupt him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Goodne&s;s, Mi&s;s, we were in &s;uch a &s;tew, us, and the &s;ervants, and all, as you can't think, for be&s;ides the gla&s;s being broke, the coachman &s;aid how the coach would'n't be &s;afe to go back to Ken&s;ington. So we did n't know what to do; however, the footmen &s;aid they'd go and tell his Lord&s;hip what had happened. So then father grew quite unea&s;y, like, for fear of his Lord|&s;hip's taking offence, and prejudicing us in our bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;o he &s;aid I &s;hould go this morning and a&s;k his pardon, 'cau&s;e of having broke the gla&s;s. So then I a&s;ked the footman the direction, and they told me he lived in Berkley-&s;quare; &s;o this morning I went, and I &s;oon found out the hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You did!"</Q> cried I, quite out of breath with apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Mi&s;s, and a very fine hou&s;e it is. Did you ever &s;ee it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;why then, Mi&s;s, I know more of his Lord&s;hip than you do, for all you knew him fir&s;t. So, when I came to the door, I was in a peck of troubles, a thinking what I &s;hould &s;ay to him; however, the &s;ervants had no mind I &s;hould &s;ee
<PB N="61" REF="60">
him, for they told me he was bu&s;y, but I might leave my me&s;&s;age. So I was ju&s;t coming away, when I bethought my&s;elf to &s;ay I come from you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From <HI>me!</HI>&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Mi&s;s,&mdash;for you know why &s;hould I have &s;uch a long walk as that for nothing? So I &s;ays to the porter, &s;ays I, tell his Lord&s;hip, &s;ays I, one wants to &s;peak to him as comes from one Mi&s;s Anville, &s;ays I."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"and by what au|thority did you take &s;uch a liberty?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Goodne&s;s, Mi&s;s, don't be in &s;uch a hurry, for you'll be as glad as me when you hear how well it all turned out. So then they made way for me, and &s;aid his Lord&s;hip would &s;ee me di|rectly; and there I was led through &s;uch a heap of &s;ervants, and &s;o many rooms, that my heart quite mi&s;gave me; for I thought, thinks I, he'll be &s;o proud he'll hardly let me &s;peak; but he's no more proud than I am, and he was as civil at if I'd been a lord my&s;elf. So then I &s;aid, I ho|ped he would n't take it ami&s;s about the gla&s;s, for it was quite an accident: but he bid me not men|tion it, for it did n't &s;ignify. And then he &s;aid he hoped you got &s;afe home, and was n't frightened; and &s;o I &s;aid yes, and I gave your duty to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My duty to him!"</Q> exclaimed I,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"and who gave you leave?&mdash;who de&s;ired you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I did it of my own head, ju&s;t to make him think I came from you. But I &s;hould have told you before how the footman &s;aid he was go|ing out of town to-morrow evening, and that his &s;i&s;ter was &s;oon to be married, and that he was a ordering a heap of things for that; &s;o it come into my head, as he was &s;o affable, that I'd a&s;k him for his cu&s;tom.

<P><Q REND="inline">"You'll drive me wild,"</Q> (cried I, &s;tarting from my &s;eat) <Q REND="inline">"you have done me an irrepara|ble injury;&mdash;but I will hear no more!"</Q>&mdash;and then I ran into my own room.</P>
<P>I was half frantic, I really raved; the good opinion of Lord Orville &s;eemed now irretrievably lo&s;t: a faint hope, which in the morning I had vainly encouraged, that I might &s;ee him again, and explain the tran&s;action, wholly vani&s;hed, now I found he was &s;o &s;oon to leave town: and I could not but conclude that, for the re&s;t of my life, he would regard me as an object of utter contempt.</P>
<P>The very idea was a dagger to my heart!&mdash;I could not &s;upport it, and&mdash;but I blu&s;h to proceed&mdash;I fear your di&s;approbation, yet I &s;hould not be con&s;cious of having merited it, but that the repug|nance I feel to relate to you what I have done, makes me &s;u&s;pect I mu&s;t have erred.

<P>You are now probably prepared for what fol|lows&mdash;which is a letter,&mdash;a ha&s;ty letter, that, in the height of my agitation, I wrote to Lord Orville.</P>

<P>I am &s;o infinitely a&s;hamed of the application made ye&s;terday for your Lord&s;hip's carriage in my name, and &s;o greatly &s;hocked at hearing how much it was injured, that I cannot forbear writing a few lines, to clear my&s;elf from the imputation of an impertinence which I blu&s;h to be &s;u&s;pected of, and to acquaint you, that the reque&s;t for your carriage was made again&s;t my con&s;ent, and the vi&s;it with which you were importuned this morning, with|out my knowledge.</P>
<P>I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly concerned at having been the in&s;trument, however innocently, of &s;o much trouble to your Lord&s;hip; but I beg you to be|lieve, that reading the&s;e lines is the only part of it which I have given voluntarily.</P>

<P>I applied to the maid of the hou&s;e to get this note conveyed to Berkeley-&s;quare; but &s;carce had I parted with it, ere I regretted having writ|ten at all, and I was flying down &s;tairs to recover it, when the voice of Sir Clement Willoughby &s;topped me. As Madame Duval had ordered we &s;hould be denied to him, I was obliged to return up &s;tairs; and after he was gone, my appli|cation was too late, as the maid had given it to a porter.</P>
<P>My time did not pa&s;s very &s;erenely while he was gone; however, he brought me no an&s;wer, but that Lord Orville was not at home. Whe|ther

<P>YOU may now, my dear Sir, &s;end Mrs. Clin|ton for your Evelina with as much &s;peed as &s;he can conveniently make the journey, for no fur|ther oppo&s;ition will be made to her leaving this town; happy had it perhaps been for her had &s;he never entered it!</P>
<P>This morning Madame Duval de&s;ired me to go to Snow-hill, with an invitation to the Branghtons and Mr. Smith, to &s;pend the evening with her: and &s;he de&s;ired M. Du Bois, who breakfa&s;ted with us, to accompany me. I was very unwil|ling to obey her, as I neither wi&s;hed to walk with M. Du Bois, nor yet to meet young Branghton. And, indeed, another, a yet more powerful rea|&s;on, added to my reluctance,&mdash;for I thought it po&s;&s;ible that Lord Orville might &s;end &s;ome an|&s;wer, or perhaps might call, during my ab|&s;ence; however, I did not dare di&s;pute her com|mands.</P>
<P>Poor M. Du Bois &s;poke not a word during our walk, which was, I believe, equally unplea&s;ant to us both. We found all the family a&s;&s;embled in the &s;hop. Mr. Smith, the moment he per|ceived
<PB N="65" REF="64">
me, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Branghton, whom he entertained with all the gallantry in his power. I rejoice to find that my conduct at the Hamp&s;tead ball has had &s;o good an effect. But young Branghton was extremely trouble&s;ome, he repeatedly laughed in my face, and looked &s;o im|pertinently &s;ignificant, that I was obliged to give up my re&s;erve to M. Du Bois, and enter into conver&s;ation with him, merely to avoid &s;uch bold|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;orry to hear from my &s;on that you was n't plea&s;ed with what we did about that Lord Orville; but I &s;hould like to know what it was you found fault with, for we did all for the be&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Goodne&s;s!"</Q> cried the &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"why if you'd &s;een Mi&s;s, you'd have been &s;urpri&s;ed,&mdash;&s;he went out of the room quite in a huff, like."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is too late, now,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"to rea&s;on up|on this &s;ubject; but, for the future, I mu&s;t take the liberty to reque&s;t, that my name may never be made u&s;e of without my knowledge. May I tell Madame Duval that you will do her the favour to accept her invitation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to me, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Smith, <Q REND="inline">"I am much obliged to the old lady, but I've no mind to be taken in by her again; you'll excu&s;e me, Ma'am."</Q></P>
<P>All the re&s;t promi&s;ed to come, and I then took leave: but as I left the &s;hop, I heard Mr. Branghton &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Take courage, Tom, &s;he's only coy."</Q> And, before I had walked ten yards, the youth followed.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much offended that I would not look at him, but began to conver&s;e with M. Du Bois, who was now more lively than I had ever before
<PB N="66" REF="65">
&s;een him; for, mo&s;t unfortunately, he mi&s;inter|preted the rea&s;on of my attention to him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t intelligence I received when I came home, was that two gentlemen had called, and left cards. I eagerly enquired for them, and read the names of Lord Orville and Sir Clement Wil|loughby. I by no means regretted that I mi&s;&s;ed &s;eeing the latter, but perhaps I may all my life regret that I mi&s;&s;ed &s;eeing the former, for proba|bly he has now left town,&mdash;and I may &s;ee him no more!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My goodne&s;s!"</Q> cried young Branghton, rudely looking over me, <Q REND="inline">"only think of that Lord's coming all this way! It's my belief he'd got &s;ome order ready for father, and &s;o he'd a mind to call and a&s;k you if I'd told him the truth."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Betty,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"how long has he been gone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not two minutes, Ma'am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then I'll lay you any wager,"</Q> &s;aid young Branghton, <Q REND="inline">"he &s;aw you and I a-walking up Holborn Hill!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"God forbid!"</Q> cried I, impatiently; and too much chagrined to bear with any more of his remarks, I ran up &s;tairs: but I heard him &s;ay to M. Du Bois, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s is &s;o <HI>uppi&s;h</HI> this morning, that I think I had better not &s;peak to her again."</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;h M. Du Bois had taken the &s;ame re&s;olu|tion; but he cho&s;e to follow me into the dining|room, which we found empty.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Vous ne l'aimez donc pas ce garcon, Made|moi&s;elle!</HI>"</Q> cried he.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me!"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"no, I dete&s;t him!"</Q> for I was quite &s;ick at heart.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ah, tu me rends la vie!</HI>"</Q> cried he, and &s;linging him&s;elf at my feet, he had ju&s;t caught
<PB N="67" REF="66">
my hand, as the door was opened by Madame Duval.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily, and with marks of guilty confu&s;ion in his face, he aro&s;e; but the rage of that lady quite amazed me! advancing to the retreating M. Du Bois, &s;he began, in French, an attack which her extreme wrath and wonderful volubili|ty almo&s;t rendered unintelligible; yet I under|&s;tood but too much, &s;ince her reproaches convin|ced me &s;he had her&s;elf propo&s;ed being the object of his affection.</P>
<P>He defended him&s;elf in a weak and eva&s;ive manner, and upon her commanding him from her &s;ight, very readily withdrew: and then, with yet greater violence, &s;he upbraided me with having <HI>&s;educed</HI> his heart, called me an ungrateful, de&s;ign|ing girl, and prote&s;ted &s;he would neither take me to Paris, nor any more intere&s;t her&s;elf in my con|cerns, unle&s;s I would in&s;tantly agree to marry young Branghton.</P>
<P>Frightened as I had been at her vehemence, this propo&s;al re&s;tored all my courage; and I frank|ly told her that in this point I never could obey her. More irritated than ever, &s;he ordered me to quit the room.</P>
<P>Such is the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs. I &s;hall excu&s;e my&s;elf from &s;eeing the Branghtons this af|ternoon: indeed, I never wi&s;h to &s;ee them again. I am &s;orry, however innocently, that I have di&s;|plea&s;ed Madame Duval, yet I &s;hall be very glad to quit this town, for I believe it does not, now, contain one per&s;on I ever wi&s;h to again meet. Had I but &s;een Lord Orville, I &s;hould regret no|thing: I could then have more fully explained what I &s;o ha&s;tily wrote; yet it will always be a plea&s;ure to me to recollect that he called, &s;ince I
<PB N="68" REF="67">
flatter my&s;elf it was in con&s;equence of his being &s;atisfied with my letter.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Sir; the time now approaches when I hope once more to receive your ble&s;|&s;ing, and to owe all my joy, all my happine&s;s to your kindne&s;s.</P>

<P>MY &s;weet Maria will be much &s;urpri&s;ed, and, I am willing to flatter my&s;elf, concerned, when, in&s;tead of her friend, &s;he receives this letter;&mdash;this cold, this inanimate letter, which will but ill expre&s;s the feelings of the heart which in|dites it.</P>
<P>When I wrote to you la&s;t Friday, I was in hourly expectation of &s;eeing Mrs. Clinton, with whom I intended to have &s;et out for Howard Grove; Mrs. Clinton came, but my plan was nece&s;&s;arily altered, for &s;he brought me a letter,&mdash;the &s;weete&s;t that ever was penned, from the be&s;t and kinde&s;t friend that ever orphan was ble&s;t with, requiring my immediate attendance at Ber|ry Hill.</P>
<P>I obeyed,&mdash;and pardon me if I own I obeyed without reluctance; after &s;o long a &s;eparation, &s;hould I not el&s;e have been the mo&s;t ungrateful of mortals?&mdash;And yet,&mdash;oh Maria! though I <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> to leave London, the gratification of my wi&s;h afforded me no happine&s;s! and though I felt an impatience inexpre&s;&s;ible to return hither, no words, no language can explain the heavine&s;s
<PB N="70" REF="69">
of heart with which I made the journey. I be|lieve you would hardly have known me;&mdash;in|deed, I hardly know my&s;elf. Perhaps had I fir&s;t &s;een <HI>you,</HI> in your kind and &s;ympathi&s;ing bo&s;om I might have ventured to have repo&s;ed every &s;ecret of my &s;oul; and then&mdash;but let me pur&s;ue my journal.</P>
<P>Mrs. Clinton delivered Madame Duval a let|ter from Mr. Villars, which reque&s;ted her leave for my return, and indeed it was very readily accorded: yet, when &s;he found, by my wil|lingne&s;s to quit town, that M. Du Bois was re|ally indifferent to me, &s;he &s;omewhat &s;oftened in my favour, and declared that, but for puni&s;hing his folly in thinking of &s;uch a child, &s;he would not have con&s;ented to my being again buried in the country.</P>
<P>All the Branghtons called to take leave of me: but I will not write a word more about them; indeed I cannot with any patience think of that family, to who&s;e forwardne&s;s and impertinence is owing all the unea&s;ine&s;s I at this moment &s;uf|fer!</P>
<P>So great was the depre&s;&s;ion of my &s;pirits up|on the road, that it was with difficulty I could per&s;uade the worthy Mrs. Clinton I was not ill: but alas, the &s;ituation of my mind was &s;uch as would have rendered any mere bodily pain, by compari&s;on, even enviable!</P>
<P>And yet, when we arrived at Berry Hill,&mdash;when the chai&s;e &s;topped at this place,&mdash;how did my heart throb with joy! and when, through the window, I beheld the deare&s;t, the mo&s;t ve|nearble of men, with uplifted hands, returning, as I doubt not, thanks for my &s;afe arrival,&mdash;good God! I thought it would have bur&s;t my bo&s;om!&mdash;I opened the chai&s;e-door my&s;elf, I
<PB N="71" REF="70">
flew,&mdash;for my feet did not &s;eem to touch the ground,&mdash;into the parlour; he had ri&s;en to meet me, but the moment I appeared, he &s;unk into his chair, uttering with a deep &s;igh, though his face <HI>beamed</HI> with delight, <Q REND="inline">"My God, I thank thee!"</Q></P>
<P>I &s;prung forward, and with a plea&s;ure that bordered upon agony, I embraced his knees, I ki&s;&s;ed his hands, I wept over them, but could not &s;peak: while he, now rai&s;ing his eyes in thankfulne&s;s towards heaven, now bowing down his reverend head, and folding me in his arms, could &s;carce articulate the ble&s;&s;ings with which his kind and benevolent heart overflowed.</P>
<P>O Mi&s;s Mirvan, to be &s;o beloved by the be&s;t of men,&mdash;&s;hould I not be happy?&mdash;Should I have one wi&s;h &s;ave that of meriting his good|ne&s;s?&mdash;Yet think me not ungrateful; indeed I am not, although the internal &s;adne&s;s of my mind unfits me, at pre&s;ent, for enjoying as I ought, the bounties of Providence.</P>
<P>I cannot journali&s;e; cannot arrange my ideas into order.</P>
<P>How little has &s;ituation to do with happi|ne&s;s! I had flattered my&s;elf that, when re&s;tor|ed to Berry Hill, I &s;hould be re&s;tored to tran|quility: far otherwi&s;e have I found it, for never yet had tranquility and Evelina &s;o little inter|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I blu&s;h for what I have written: Can you, Maria, forgive my gravity? but I re&s;train it &s;o much, and &s;o painfully, in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Villars, that I know not how to deny my&s;elf the con&s;olation of indulging it to you.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Mi&s;s Mirvan.</P>
<P>Yet one thing I mu&s;t add; do not let the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of this letter deceive you: do not im|pute

<P>YOU accu&s;e me of my&s;tery, and charge me with re&s;erve: I cannot doubt but I mu&s;t have merited the accu&s;ation;&mdash;yet, to clear my&s;elf,&mdash;you know not how painful will be the ta&s;k.

<P>I know not how to come to the point; twenty times have I attempted it in vain;&mdash;but I will <HI>force</HI> my&s;elf to proceed.</P>

Oh, Mi&s;s Mirvan, could you ever have believ|ed, that one who &s;eemed formed as a pattern for his fellow-creatures, as a model of perfection,&mdash;one who&s;e elegance &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all de&s;cription,&mdash;who&s;e &s;weetne&s;s of manners di&s;graced all compari|&s;on,&mdash;Oh, Mi&s;s Mirvan, could you ever have believed that <HI>Lord Orville</HI> would have treated me with indignity?</P>

<P>With tran&s;port, mo&s;t charming of thy &s;ex, did I read the letter with which you ye&s;terday morning favoured me. I am &s;orry the affair of the carriage &s;hould have given you any concern, but I am highly flattered by the anxiety you ex|pre&s;s &s;o kindly. Believe me, my lovely girl, I am truly &s;en&s;ible of the honour of your good opi|nion, and feel my&s;elf deeply penetrated with love and gratitude. The corre&s;pondence you have &s;o &s;weetly commenced I &s;hall be proud of continu|ing, and I hope the &s;trong &s;en&s;e I have or the fa|vour you do me, will prevent your withdrawing it.

My impatience for his arrival will be very great, though inferior to that with which I burn, to tell you, in per&s;on, how much I am, my &s;weet girl,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your grateful admirer, ORVILLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>What a letter! how has my proud heart &s;welled every line I have copied! What I wrote to him you know; tell me then, my dear friend, do you think it merited &s;uch an an&s;wer?&mdash;and that I have de&s;ervedly incurred the liberty he has taken? I meant nothing but a &s;imple apology, which I thought as much due to my own character, as to his; yet, by the con&s;truction he &s;eems to have put upon it, &s;hould you not have imagined it con|tained the avowal of &s;entiments which might, in|deed, have provoked his contempt?</P>
<P>The moment the letter was delivered to me, I retired to my own room to read it, and &s;o eager was my fir&s;t peru&s;al, that,&mdash;I am a&s;hamed to own it gave me no &s;en&s;ation but of delight. Un&s;u&s;pi|cious of any impropriety from Lord Orville, I perceived not immediately the impertinence it im|plied,&mdash;I only marked the expre&s;&s;ions of his own regard; and I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed, that I was unable, for &s;ome time, to compo&s;e my&s;elf, or read it again,&mdash;I could only walk up and down the room, repeating to my&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;am I, then, loved by Lord Orville?"</Q></P>
<P>But this dream was &s;oon over, and I awoke to far different feelings; upon a &s;econd reading I thought every word changed,&mdash;it did not &s;eem the
<PB N="75" REF="74">
&s;ame letter,&mdash;I could not find one &s;entence that I could look at without blu&s;hing: my a&s;toni&s;hment was extreme, and it was &s;ucceeded by the utmo&s;t indignation.</P>
<P>If, as I am very ready to acknowledge, I erred in writing to Lord Orville, was it for <HI>him</HI> to pu|ni&s;h the error? If he was offended, could he not have been &s;ilent? If he thought my letter ill|judged, &s;hould he not have pitied my ignorance? have con&s;idered my youth, and allowed for my inexperience.</P>
<P>Oh Maria, how have I been deceived in this man! Words have no power to tell the high opi|nion I had of him; to that was owing the unfor|tunate &s;olicitude which prompted my writing,&mdash;a &s;olicitude I mu&s;t for ever repent!</P>
<P>Yet perhaps I have rather rea&s;on to rejoice than to grieve, &s;ince this affair has &s;hewn me his real di&s;po&s;ition, and removed that partiality, which, covering his every imperfection, left only his vir|tues and good qualities expo&s;ed to view. Had the deception continued much longer, had my mind re|ceived any additional prejudice in his favour, who knows whither my mi&s;taken ideas might have led me? Indeed I fear I was in greater danger than I apprehended, or can now think of without trembling,&mdash;for oh, if this weak heart of mine had been penetrated with too deep an impre&s;&s;ion of his merit,&mdash;my peace and happine&s;s had been lo&s;t for ever!</P>
<P>I would fain encourage more chearful thoughts, fain drive from my mind the melancholy that has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it,&mdash;but I cannot &s;ucceed; for, added to the humiliating feelings which &s;o power|fully oppre&s;s me, I have yet another cau&s;e of con|cern;&mdash;alas, my dear Maria, I have broken the tranquility of the be&s;t of men!</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75">
I have never had the courage to &s;hew him this cruel letter: I could not bear &s;o greatly to depre|ciate in his opinion, one whom I had, with infinite anxiety, rai&s;ed in it my&s;elf. Indeed, my fir&s;t determination was to confine my chagrin totally to my own bo&s;om; but your friendly enquiries have drawn it from me; and now I wi&s;h I had made no concealment from the beginning, &s;ince I know not how to account for a gravity which not all my endeavours can entirely hide or re|pre&s;s.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions is, le&s;t he &s;hould imagine that my re&s;idence in London has given me a di&s;ta&s;te to the country. Every body I &s;ee takes notice of my being altered, and looking pale and ill. I &s;hould be very indifferent to all &s;uch ob&s;ervations, did I not perceive that they draw upon me the eyes of Mr. Villars, which gli&s;ten with affectionate concern.</P>
<P>This morning, in &s;peaking of my London ex|pedition, he mentioned Lord Orville. I felt &s;o much di&s;turbed, that I would in&s;tantly have changed the &s;ubject; but he would not allow me, and, very unexpectedly, he began his panegyric, extolling, in &s;trong terms, his manly and honou|rable behaviour in regard to the Marybone ad|venture. My cheeks glowed with indignation every word he &s;poke;&mdash;&s;o lately as I had my&s;elf fancied him the noble&s;t of his &s;ex, now that I was &s;o well convinced of my mi&s;take, I could not bear to hear his unde&s;erved prai&s;es uttered by one &s;o really good, &s;o un&s;u&s;pecting, &s;o pure of heart!</P>
<P>What he thought of my &s;ilence and unea&s;ine&s;s I fear to know, but I hope he will mention the &s;ubject no more. I will not, however, with un|grateful indolence, give way to a &s;adne&s;s which

I find infectious to him who merits the mo&s;t chearful exertion of my &s;pirits.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill, <DATE>July 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST own my&s;elf &s;omewhat di&s;tre&s;&s;ed how to an&s;wer your raillery: yet believe me, my dear Maria, your &s;ugge&s;tions are tho&s;e of <HI>fancy,</HI> not of <HI>truth.</HI> I am uncon&s;cious of the weakne&s;s you &s;u&s;pect; yet, to di&s;pel your doubts, I will animate my&s;elf more than ever to conquer my chagrin, and to recover my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>You wonder, you &s;ay, &s;ince my <HI>heart</HI> takes no part in this affair, why it &s;hould make me &s;o unhappy? And can you, acquainted as you are with the high opinion I entertained of Lord Or|ville, can you wonder that &s;o great a di&s;appoint|ment in his character &s;hould affect me? indeed, had &s;o &s;trange a letter been &s;ent to me from <HI>any</HI> body, it could not have failed &s;hocking me; how much more &s;en&s;ibly, then, mu&s;t I feel &s;uch an affront, when received from the man in the
<PB N="78" REF="77">
world I had imagined lea&s;t capable of giving it?</P>
<P>You are glad I made no reply; a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, my dear friend, had this letter been the mo&s;t re|&s;pectful that could be written, the clande&s;tine air given to it, by his propo&s;al of &s;ending his &s;er|vant for my an&s;wer, in&s;tead of having it directed to his hou&s;e, would effectually have prevented my writing. Indeed, I have an aver&s;ion the mo&s;t &s;incere to all my&s;teries, all private actions; however fooli&s;hly and blameably, in regard to this letter, I have deviated from the open path which, from my earlie&s;t infancy, I was taught to tread.</P>
<P>He talks of my having <HI>commenced a corre&s;pon|dence</HI> with him; and could Lord Orville indeed believe I had &s;uch a de&s;ign? believe me &s;o for|ward, &s;o bold, &s;o &s;trangely ridiculous? I know not if his man called or not, but I rejoice that I quitted London before he came, and without leaving any me&s;&s;age for him. What indeed, could I have &s;aid? it would have been a conde|&s;cen&s;ion very unmerited, to have taken any, the lea&s;t notice of &s;uch a letter.</P>
<P>Never &s;hall I cea&s;e to wonder how he could write it. Oh, Maria, what, what could induce him &s;o cau&s;ele&s;sly to wound and affront one who would &s;ooner have died than wilfully offend <HI>him?</HI>&mdash;How mortifying a freedom of &s;tyle! how cruel an implication conveyed by his <HI>thanks,</HI> and expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude! Is it not a&s;toni&s;hing, that any man can <HI>appear</HI> &s;o mode&s;t, who is &s;o vain?</P>
<P>Every hour I regret the &s;ecrecy I have ob&s;erv|ed with my beloved Mr. Villars; I know not what bewitched me, but I felt, at fir&s;t, a repug|nance to publi&s;hing this affair that I could not &s;ur|mount,
<PB N="79" REF="78">
&mdash;and now, I am a&s;hamed of confe&s;&s;ing that I have any thing to confe&s;s! Yet I de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed for the fal&s;e delicacy which occa&s;i|oned my &s;ilence; &s;ince, if Lord Orville him|&s;elf was contented to forfeit his character, was it for me, almo&s;t at the expence of my own, to &s;upport it?</P>
<P>Yet I believe I &s;hould be very ea&s;y, now the fir&s;t &s;hock is over, and now that I &s;ee the whole affair with the re&s;entment it merits, did not all my good friends in this neighbourhood, who think me extremely altered, teaze me about my gravity, and torment Mr. Villars with ob&s;ervations upon my dejection, and falling away. The &s;ubject is no &s;ooner &s;tarted, than a deep gloom over&s;preads his venerable countenance, and he looks at me with a tenderne&s;s &s;o melancholy, that I know not how to endure the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exci|ting it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn, a lady of large fortune, who lives about three miles from Berry Hill, and who has always honoured me with very di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of regard, is going, in a &s;hort time, to Bri&s;tol, and has propo&s;ed to Mr. Villars to take me with her, for the recovery of my health. He &s;eemed very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed whether to con&s;ent or refu&s;e; but I, without any he&s;itation, warmly oppo&s;ed the &s;cheme, prote&s;ting my health could no where be better than in this pure air. He had the goodne&s;s to thank me for this readine&s;s to &s;tay with him: but he is all goodne&s;s! Oh that it were in my power to be, indeed, what in the kindne&s;s of his heart he has called me, the comfort of his age, and &s;olace of his infir|mities!</P>
<P>Never do I wi&s;h to be again &s;eparated from him. If here I am grave, el&s;ewhere I &s;hould be
<PB N="80" REF="79">
unhappy. In his pre&s;ence, with a very little ex|ertion, all the chearfulne&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems ready to return; the benevolence of his counte|nance reanimates, the harmony of his temper com|po&s;es, the purity of his character edifies me! I owe to him every thing; and, far from finding my debt of gratitude a weight, the fir&s;t pride, fir&s;t plea&s;ure of my life is the recollection of the obligations conferred upon me by a goodne&s;s &s;o unequalled.</P>
<P>Once, indeed, I thought there exi&s;ted another,&mdash;who, when <HI>time had wintered o'er his locks,</HI> would have &s;hone forth among his fellow-crea|tures, with the &s;ame brightne&s;s of worth which dignifies my honoured Mr. Villars; a brightne&s;s, how &s;uperior in value to that which re&s;ults from mere quickne&s;s of parts, wit, or imagination! a brightne&s;s, which, not contented with merely diffu&s;ing &s;miles, and gaining admiration from the &s;allies of the &s;pirits, reflects a real and a glorious lu&s;tre upon all mankind! Oh how great was my error! how ill did I judge! how cruelly have I been deceived!</P>
<P>I will not go to Bri&s;tol, though Mrs. Selwyn is very urgent with me;&mdash;but I de&s;ire not to &s;ee any more of the world; the few months I have already pa&s;&s;ed in it, have &s;ufficed to give me a di&s;|gu&s;t even to its name.</P>
<P>I hope, too, I &s;hall &s;ee Lord Orville no more; accu&s;tomed, from my fir&s;t knowledge of him, to regard him as a <HI>being &s;uperior to his race,</HI> his pre|&s;ence, perhaps, might bani&s;h my re&s;entment, and I might forget his ill conduct,&mdash;for oh, Maria!&mdash;I &s;hould not know how to &s;ee <HI>Lord Orville</HI>&mdash;and to think of di&s;plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>As a &s;i&s;ter I loved him,&mdash;I could have entru&s;t|ed him with every thought of my heart, had he
<PB N="81" REF="80">
deigned to wi&s;h my confidence; &s;o &s;teady did I think his honour, &s;o <HI>feminine</HI> his delicacy, and &s;o amiable his nature! I have a thou&s;and times ima|gined that the whole &s;tudy of his life, and whole purport of his reflections, tended &s;olely to the good and happine&s;s of others:&mdash;but I will talk,&mdash;write,&mdash;think of him no more!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill, <DATE>Augu&s;t 10.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU complain of my &s;ilence, my dear Mi&s;s Mirvan,&mdash;but what have I to write? Narrative does not offer, nor does a lively imagination &s;up|ply the deficiency. I have, however, at pre&s;ent, &s;ufficient matter for a letter, in relating a conver|&s;ation I had ye&s;terday with Mr. Villars.</P>
<P>Our breakfa&s;t had been the mo&s;t chearful we have had &s;ince my return hither; and, when it was over, he did not, as u&s;ual, retire to his &s;tudy, but continued to conver&s;e with me while I work|ed. We might, probably, have pa&s;&s;ed all the morning thus &s;ociably, but for the entrance of a farmer, who came to &s;olicit advice concerning &s;ome dome&s;tic affairs. They withdrew together into the &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The moment I was alone, my &s;pirits failed me; the exertion with which I had &s;upported them, had fatigued my mind: I flung away my work,
<PB N="82" REF="81">
and, leaning my arms on the table, gave way to a train of di&s;agreeable reflections, which, bur&s;t|ing from the re&s;traint that had &s;mothered them, filled me with unu&s;ual &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>This was my &s;ituation, when, looking towards the door, which was open, I perceived Mr. Vil|lars, who was earne&s;tly regarding me, <Q REND="inline">"Is Far|mer Smith gone, Sir?"</Q> cried I, ha&s;tily ri&s;ing, and &s;natching up my work.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't let me di&s;turb you,"</Q> &s;aid he, grave|ly; <Q REND="inline">"I will go again to my &s;tudy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you, Sir?&mdash;I was in hopes you were coming to &s;it here."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In hopes!&mdash;and why, Evelina, &s;hould you hope it?"</Q></P>
<P>This que&s;tion was &s;o unexpected, that I knew not how to an&s;wer it; but, as I &s;aw he was mov|ing away, I followed, and begged him to re|turn.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my dear, no,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a forced &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"I only interrupt your meditations."</Q></P>
<P>Again I knew not what to &s;ay; and while I he|&s;itated, he retired. My heart was with him, but I had not the courage to follow. The idea of an explanation, brought on in &s;o &s;eri|ous a manner, frightened me. I recollected the &s;u&s;picion <HI>you</HI> had drawn from my unea&s;ine&s;s, and I feared that he might make a &s;imilar interpre|tation.</P>
<P>Solitary and thoughtful, I pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the morning in my own room. At dinner I a|gain attempted to be chearful; but Mr. Villars him&s;elf was grave, and I had not &s;ufficient &s;pirits to &s;upport a conver&s;ation merely by my own efforts. As &s;oon as dinner was over, he took a book, and I walked to the window. I believe I remained near an hour in this &s;ituation. All
<PB N="83" REF="82">
my thoughts were directed to con&s;idering how I might di&s;pel the doubts which I apprehended Mr. Villars had formed, without acknowledging a circum&s;tance which I had &s;uffered &s;o much pain merely to conceal. But while I was thus planning for the future, I forgot the pre&s;ent; and &s;o in|tent was I upon the &s;ubject which occupied me, that the &s;trange appearance of my unu&s;ual in|activity, and extreme thoughtfulne&s;s, never oc|curred to me. But when, at la&s;t, I recollected my&s;elf, and turned round, I &s;aw that Mr. Vil|lars had parted with his book, and was wholly engro&s;&s;ed in attending to me. I &s;tarted from my reverie, and, hardly knowing what I &s;aid, a&s;ked if he had been reading?</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a moment, and then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, my child;&mdash;a book that both afflicts and perplex|es me!"</Q></P>
<P>He means <HI>me,</HI> thought I; and therefore I made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What if we read it together?"</Q> continu|ed he, <Q REND="inline">"will you a&s;&s;i&s;t me to clear its ob&s;cur|ity?"</Q></P>
<P>I knew not what to &s;ay, but I &s;ighed, invo|luntarily, from the bottom of my heart. He ro&s;e, and, approaching me, &s;aid, with emotion, <Q REND="inline">"My child, I can no longer be a &s;ilent wit|ne&s;s of thy &s;orrow,&mdash;is not <HI>thy</HI> &s;orrow <HI>my</HI> &s;or|row?&mdash;and ought I to be a &s;tranger to the cau&s;e, when I &s;o deeply &s;ympathi&s;e in the ef|fect?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cau&s;e, Sir,"</Q> cried I, greatly alarmed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"what cau&s;e?&mdash;I don't know, I can't tell,&mdash;I&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fear not,"</Q> &s;aid he, kindly, <Q REND="inline">"to unbo|&s;om thy&s;elf to me, my deare&s;t Evelina; open to me thy whole heart,&mdash;it can have no feelings
<PB N="84" REF="83">
for which I will not make allowance. Tell me, therefore, what it is that thus afflicts us both, and who knows but I may &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome means of relief?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are too, too good,"</Q> cried I, greatly embarra&s;&s;ed; <Q REND="inline">"but indeed I know not what you mean."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"it is painful to you to &s;peak: &s;uppo&s;e, then, I endeavour to &s;ave you by gue&s;&s;ing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible! impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q> cried I, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"no one living could ever gue&s;s, ever &s;up|po&s;e&mdash;"</Q> I &s;topped abruptly; for I then recol|lected, I was acknowledging &s;omething <HI>was</HI> to be gue&s;&s;ed: however, he noticed not my mi&s;|take.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At lea&s;t let me try,"</Q> an&s;wered he, mild|ly; <Q REND="inline">"perhaps I may be a better diviner than you imagine: if I gue&s;s every thing that is pro|bable, &s;urely I mu&s;t approach near the real rea|&s;on. Be hone&s;t, then, my love, and &s;peak without re&s;erve,&mdash;does not the country, after &s;o much gaiety, &s;o much variety, does it not appear in&s;ipid and tire&s;ome?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed!" I love it more than ever, and more than ever do I wi&s;h I had never, never quitted it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, my child! that I had not permitted the journey! My judgment always oppo&s;ed it, but my re&s;olution was not proof again&s;t per&s;ua|&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I blu&s;h, indeed,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"to recollect my earne&s;tne&s;s;&mdash;but I have been my own pu|ni&s;her!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is too late, now,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"to re|flect upon this &s;ubject; let us endeavour to a|void repentance for the time to come, and we
<PB N="85" REF="84">
&s;hall not have erred without reaping &s;ome in|&s;truction."</Q> Then &s;eating him&s;elf, and making me &s;it by him, he continued: <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t now gue&s;s again; perhaps you regret the lo&s;s of tho&s;e friends you knew in town,&mdash;perhaps you mi&s;s their &s;o|ciety, and fear you may &s;ee them no more?&mdash;perhaps Lord Orville&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>I could not keep my &s;eat, but ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir, a&s;k me nothing more!&mdash;for I have nothing to own,&mdash;nothing to &s;ay;&mdash;my gravity has been merely accidental, and I can give no rea&s;on for it at all. Shall I fetch you ano|ther book?&mdash;or will you have this again?"</Q></P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes he was totally &s;ilent, and I pretended to employ my&s;elf in looking for a book. At la&s;t, with a deep &s;igh, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee, but too plainly, that though Evelina is returned,&mdash;I have lo&s;t my child!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, no,"</Q> cried I, inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hock|ed, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he is more yours than ever! Without you, the world would be a de&s;art to her, and life a burthen;&mdash;forgive her then, and&mdash;if you can,&mdash;conde&s;cend to be, once more, the confident of all her thoughts."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How highly I value, how greatly I wi&s;h for her confidence,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he cannot but know;&mdash;yet to extort, to tear it from her,&mdash;my ju&s;tice, my affection, both revolt at the idea. I am &s;orry that I was &s;o earne&s;t with you;&mdash;leave me, my dear, leave me and compo&s;e your&s;elf;&mdash;we will meet again at tea."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you then refu&s;e to hear me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, but I abhor to compel you. I have long &s;een that your mind has been ill at ea&s;e, and mine has largely partaken of your concern: I forbore to que&s;tion you, for I hoped that time, and ab&s;ence from whatever excited your unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="86" REF="85">
might be&s;t operate in &s;ilence: but, alas! your affliction &s;eems only to augment,&mdash;your health declines,&mdash;your look alters.&mdash;Oh, Evelina, my aged heart bleeds to &s;ee the change!&mdash;bleeds to behold the darling it had cheri&s;hed, the prop it had reared for its &s;upport, when bowed down by years and infirmities, &s;inking it&s;elf under the pre&s;&s;ure of internal grief!&mdash;&s;truggling to hide, what it &s;hould &s;eek to participate!&mdash;But go, my dear, go to your own room,&mdash;we both want com|po&s;ure, and we will talk of this matter &s;ome other time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh Sir,"</Q> cried I, penetrated to the &s;oul, <Q REND="inline">"bid me not leave you!&mdash;think me not &s;o lo&s;t to feeling, to gratitude&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not a word of that,"</Q> interrupted he; <Q REND="inline">"it pains me you &s;hould think upon that &s;ubject; pains me you &s;hould ever remember that you have not a natural, an hereditary right to every thing within my power. I meant not to affect you thus,&mdash;I hoped to have &s;oothed you!&mdash;but my anxiety betrayed me to an urgency that has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed you. Comfort your&s;elf, my love, and doubt not but that time will &s;tand your friend, and all will end well."</Q></P>
<P>I bur&s;t into tears: with difficulty had I &s;o long re&s;trained them; for my heart, while it glowed with tenderne&s;s and gratitude, was oppre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of its own unworthine&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"You are all, all goodne&s;s!"</Q> cried I, in a voice &s;carce audi|ble, <Q REND="inline">"little as I de&s;erve,&mdash;unable as I am to re|pay, &s;uch kindne&s;s,&mdash;yet my whole &s;oul feels,&mdash;thanks you for it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My deare&s;t child,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot bear to &s;ee thy tears;&mdash;for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake dry them,&mdash;&s;uch a &s;ight is too much for me: think of that, Evelina, and take comfort, I charge thee!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86">
<Q REND="inline">"Say then,"</Q> cried I, kneeling at his feet, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ay then that you forgive me! that you par|don my re&s;erve,&mdash;that you will again &s;uffer me to tell you my mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, and rely up|on my promi&s;e never more to forfeit your con|fidence!&mdash;my father!&mdash;my protector!&mdash;my ever honoured,&mdash;ever loved,&mdash;my be&s;t and only friend!&mdash;&s;ay you forgive your Evelina, and &s;he will &s;tudy better to de&s;erve your goodne&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P>He rai&s;ed, he embraced me; he called me his &s;ole joy, his only earthly hope, and the child of his bo&s;om! He folded me to his heart, and, while I wept from the fulne&s;s of mine, with words of &s;weete&s;t kindne&s;s and con&s;olation, he &s;oothed and tranquili&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Dear to my remembrance will ever be that moment, when, bani&s;hing the re&s;erve I had &s;o fooli&s;hly planned, and &s;o painfully &s;upported, I was re&s;tored to the confidence of the be&s;t of men!</P>
<P>When, at length, we were again quietly and compo&s;edly &s;eated by each other, and Mr. Vil|lars waited for the explanation I had begged him to hear, I found my&s;elf extremely embarra&s;&s;ed how to introduce the &s;ubject which mu&s;t lead to it. He &s;aw my di&s;tre&s;s, and, with a kind of benevolent plea&s;antry, a&s;ked me if I would let him <HI>gue&s;s</HI> any more? I a&s;&s;ented in &s;ilence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall I, then, go back to where I left off?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If&mdash;if you plea&s;e;&mdash;I believe &s;o,&mdash;"</Q> &s;aid I, &s;tammering.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well then, my love, I think, I was &s;peak|ing of the regret it was natural you &s;hould feel upon quitting tho&s;e from whom you had received civility and kindne&s;s, with &s;o little certainty of ever &s;eeing them again, or being able to return
<PB N="88" REF="87">
their good offices? The&s;e are circum&s;tances that afford but melancholy reflections to young minds; and the affectionate di&s;po&s;ition of my Evelina, open to all &s;ocial feelings, mu&s;t be hurt more than u&s;ual by &s;uch con&s;iderations.&mdash;You are &s;ilent, my dear?&mdash;Shall I name tho&s;e whom I think mo&s;t worthy the regret I &s;peak of? We &s;hall then &s;ee if our opinions coincide."</Q></P>
<P>Still I &s;aid nothing, and he continued.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In your London journal, nobody appears in a more amiable, a more re&s;pectable light, than Lord Orville, and perhaps&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew what you would &s;ay,"</Q> cried I, ha&s;t|ily, <Q REND="inline">"and I have long feared where your &s;u&s;pi|cions would fall; but indeed, Sir, you are mi&s;|taken; I hate Lord Orville,&mdash;he is the la&s;t man in the world in who&s;e favour I &s;hould be preju|diced."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;topped; for Mr. Villars looked at me with &s;uch infinite &s;urpri&s;e, that my own warmth made me blu&s;h. <Q REND="inline">"You <HI>hate</HI> Lord Orville!"</Q> re|peated he.</P>
<P>I could make no an&s;wer, but took from my pocket-book the letter, and, giving it to him, <Q REND="inline">"See, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"how differently the &s;ame man can <HI>talk,</HI> and <HI>write!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He read it three times ere he &s;poke; and then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed, that I know not what I read. When had you this let|ter?"</Q></P>
<P>I told him. Again he read it; and, after con|&s;idering its contents &s;ome time, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I can form but one conjecture concerning this mo&s;t ex|traordinary performance: he mu&s;t certainly have been intoxicated when he wrote it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Orville intoxicated!"</Q> repeated I; <Q REND="inline">"once I thought him a &s;tranger to all intempe|rance,
<PB N="89" REF="88">
&mdash;but it is very po&s;&s;ible, for I can believe any thing now."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That a man who had behaved with &s;o &s;trict a regard to delicacy,"</Q> continued Mr. Villars, <Q REND="inline">"and who, as far as occa&s;ion had allowed, manife&s;ted &s;entiments the mo&s;t honourable, &s;hould thus in&s;olently, thus wantonly, in&s;ult a mode&s;t young woman, in his perfect &s;en&s;es, I cannot think po&s;&s;ible. But, my dear, you &s;hould have inclo&s;ed this letter in an empty cover, and have returned it to him again: &s;uch a re&s;entment would at once have become <HI>your</HI> character, and have given him an opportunity, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, of clearing his own. He could not well have read this letter the next morning, without being &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of having writ|ten it."</Q></P>
<P>Oh Maria! why had not I this thought? I might then have received &s;ome apology; the mortification would then have been <HI>his,</HI> not <HI>mine.</HI> It is true, he could not have rein&s;tated him&s;elf &s;o highly in my opinion as I had once ignorantly placed him, &s;ince the conviction of &s;uch intem|perance would have levelled him with the re&s;t of his imperfect race; yet, my humbled pride might have been con&s;oled by his acknowledg|ments.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould I allow my&s;elf to be humbled by a man who can &s;uffer his rea&s;on to be thus ab|jectly deba&s;ed, when I am exalted by one who knows no vice, and &s;carcely a failing,&mdash;but by hear&s;ay? To think of his kindne&s;s, and reflect upon his prai&s;es, might animate and comfort me even in the mid&s;t of affliction. <Q REND="inline">"Your indigna|tion,</Q> "&s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">is the re&s;ult of virtue; you fan|cied Lord Orville was without fault&mdash;he had the appearance of infinite worthine&s;s, and you &s;uppo|&s;ed
<PB N="90" REF="89">
his character accorded with his appearance: guilele&s;s your&s;elf, how could you prepare again&s;t the duplicity of another? Your di&s;appointment has but been proportioned to your expectations, and you have chiefly owed its &s;everity to the in|nocence which hid its approach."</Q></P>
<P>I will bid the&s;e words dwell ever in my memo|ry, and they &s;hall chear, comfort, and enliven me! This conver&s;ation, though extremely af|fecting to me at the time it pa&s;&s;ed, has relieved my mind from much anxiety. Concealment, my dear Maria, is the foe of tranquility: however I may err in future, I will never be di&s;ingenu|ous in acknowledging my errors. To you, and to Mr. Villars, I vow an unremitting confi|dence.</P>
<P>And yet, though I am more at ea&s;e, I am far from well: I have been &s;ome time writing this letter; but I hope I &s;hall &s;end you, &s;oon, a more chearful one.</P>
<P>Adieu, my &s;weet friend. I entreat you not to acquaint even your dear mother with this affair; Lord Orville is a favourite with her, and why &s;hould I publi&s;h that he de&s;erves not that ho|nour?</P>

<P>YOU will be again &s;urpri&s;ed, my dear Maria, at &s;eeing whence I date my letter: but I have been very ill, and Mr. Villars was &s;o much alarmed, that he not only in&s;i&s;ted upon my accompanying
<PB N="91" REF="90">
Mrs. Selwyn hither, but earne&s;tly de&s;ired &s;he would ha&s;ten her intended journey.</P>
<P>We travelled very &s;lowly, and I did not find my&s;elf &s;o much fatigued as I expected. We are &s;ituated upon a mo&s;t delightful &s;pot; the pro&s;pect is beautiful, the air pure, and the weather very favourable to invalids. I am already better, and I doubt not but I &s;hall &s;oon be well; as well, in regard to mere health, as I wi&s;h to be.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s the reluctance with which I parted from my reverend Mr. Villars: it was not like that parting which, la&s;t April, preceded my journey to Howard Grove, when, all expectati|on and hope, tho' I wept, I rejoiced, and though I &s;incerely grieved to leave him, I yet wi&s;hed to be gone: the &s;orrow I now felt was unmixed with any livelier &s;en&s;ation; expectation was vani&s;hed, and hope I had none! All that I held mo&s;t dear upon earth, I quitted, and that upon an errand to the &s;ucce&s;s of which I was totally indifferent, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my health. Had it been to have &s;een my &s;weet Maria, or her dear mo|ther, I &s;hould not have repined.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn is very kind and attentive to me. She is extremely clever; her under&s;tanding, in|deed, may be called <HI>ma&s;culine;</HI> but, unfortu|nately, her manners de&s;erve the &s;ame epithet; for, in &s;tudying to acquire the knowledge of the other &s;ex, &s;he has lo&s;t all the &s;oftne&s;s of her own. In regard to my&s;elf, however, as I have neither courage nor inclination to argue with her, I have never been per&s;onally hurt at her want of gentle|ne&s;s; a virtue which, neverthele&s;s, &s;eems &s;o e&s;|&s;ential a part of the female character, that I find my&s;elf more awkward, and le&s;s at ea&s;e, with a woman who wants it, than I do with a man. She is not a favourite with Mr. Villars, who has often
<PB N="92" REF="91">
been di&s;gu&s;ted at her unmerciful propen&s;ity to &s;a|tire: but his anxiety that I &s;hould try the effect of the Bri&s;tol waters, overcame his di&s;like of committing me to her care. Mrs. Clinton is al&s;o here; &s;o that I &s;hall be as well attended as his ut|mo&s;t partiality could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I will continue to write to you, my dear Mi&s;s Mirvan, with as much con&s;tancy as if I had no other corre&s;pondent; tho', during my ab&s;ence from Berry Hill, my letters may, perhaps, be &s;hortened on account of the minutene&s;s of the journal which I mu&s;t write to my beloved Mr. Villars: but you, who know his expectations, and how many ties bind me to fulfil them, will, I am &s;ure, rather excu&s;e any omi&s;&s;ion to your&s;elf, than any negligence to him.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bri&s;tol Hotwell, <DATE>Sept. 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE fir&s;t fortnight that I pa&s;&s;ed here, was &s;o quiet, &s;o &s;erene, that it gave me rea&s;on to expect a &s;ettled calm during my &s;tay; but if I may now judge of the time to come, by the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my mind, the calm will be &s;ucceeded by a &s;torm, of which I dread the violence!</P>
<P>This morning, in my way to the pump-room, with Mrs. Selwyn, we were both very much in|commoded by three gentlemen, who were &s;aun|tering by the &s;ide of the Avon, laughing and talking very loud, and lounging &s;o di&s;agreeably that we knew not how to pa&s;s them. They all three fixed their eyes very boldly upon me, al|ternately
<PB N="93" REF="92">
looking under my hat, and whi&s;pering one another. Mrs. Selwyn a&s;&s;umed an air of un|common &s;ternne&s;s, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You will plea&s;e, gentlemen, either to proceed your&s;elves, or to &s;uffer us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! Ma'am,"</Q> cried one of them, <Q REND="inline">"we will &s;uffer <HI>you,</HI> with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will &s;uffer us <HI>both,</HI>"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"or I am much mi&s;taken; you had better, therefore, make way quietly, for I &s;hould be &s;or|ry to give my &s;ervant the trouble of teaching you better manners."</Q></P>
<P>Her commanding air &s;truck them, yet they all cho&s;e to laugh, and one of them wi&s;hed the fellow would begin his le&s;&s;on, that he might have the plea&s;ure of rolling him into the Avon; while ano|ther, advancing to me with a freedom that made me &s;tart, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"By my &s;oul, I did not know you!&mdash;but I am &s;ure I cannot be mi&s;taken;&mdash;had not I the honour of &s;eeing you, once, at the Pantheon?"</Q></P>
<P>I then recollected the nobleman who, at that place, had &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed me. I court&s;ied without &s;peaking. They all bowed, and making, though in a very ea&s;y manner, an apology to Mrs. Selwyn, they &s;uffered us to pa&s;s on, but cho&s;e to accompany us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And where,"</Q> continued this Lord, <Q REND="inline">"can you &s;o long have hid your&s;elf? do you know I have been in &s;earch of you this age? I could nei|ther find you out, nor hear of you; not a crea|ture could inform me what was become of you. I cannot imagine where you could be immured. I went to two or three public places every night, in hopes of meeting you. Pray did you leave town?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93">
<Q REND="inline">"So early in the &s;ea&s;on!&mdash;what could po&s;&s;ibly induce you to go before the birth-day?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had nothing, my Lord, to do with the birth-day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By my &s;oul, all the women who <HI>had,</HI> may rejoice you were away. Have you been here any time?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not above a fortnight, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A fortnight!&mdash;how unlucky that I did not meet you &s;ooner! but I have had a run of ill luck ever &s;ince I came. How long &s;hall you &s;tay?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, I don't know."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Six weeks, I hope; for I &s;hall wi&s;h the place at the devil when you go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you, then, flatter your&s;elf, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwin, who had hitherto li&s;tened in &s;i|lent contempt, <Q REND="inline">"that you &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch a beauti|ful &s;pot as this when you vi&s;it the dominions of the devil?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha, ha, ha! Faith, my Lord,</Q> "&s;aid one of his companions, who &s;till walked with us, though the other had taken leave; <Q REND="inline">"the lady is rather hard upon you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not at all,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Selwyn; <Q REND="inline">"for as I cannot doubt but his Lord&s;hip's rank and intere&s;t will &s;ecure him a place there, it would be reflect|ing on his under&s;tanding, to &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould not wi&s;h to enlarge and beautify his dwelling."</Q></P>
<P>Much as I was di&s;gu&s;ted with this Lord, I mu&s;t own Mrs. Selwyn's &s;everity rather &s;urpri&s;ed me; but you, who have &s;o often ob&s;erved it, will not wonder &s;he took &s;o fair an opportun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of indulg|ing her humour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to <HI>places,</HI>"</Q> returned he, totally unmov|ed, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;o indifferent to them, that the devil take me, if I care which way I go! <HI>objects,</HI> in|deed, I am not &s;o ea&s;y about; and therefore I ex|pect
<PB N="95" REF="94">
that tho&s;e angels with who&s;e beauty I am &s;o much enraptured in this world, will have the goodne&s;s to afford me &s;ome little con&s;olation in the other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, my Lord!"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"would you wi&s;h to degrade the habitation of your friend, by admitting into it the in&s;ipid com|pany of the upper regions?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What do you do with your&s;elf this even|ing?"</Q> &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, turning to me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be at home, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, a-propos&mdash;where are you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Young ladies, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"are <HI>no where.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Prithee,"</Q> whi&s;pered his Lord&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"is that queer woman your mother?"</Q></P>
<P>Good Heavens, Sir, what words for &s;uch a que&s;tion!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your maiden aunt, then?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whoever &s;he is, I wi&s;h &s;he would mind her own affairs: I don't know what the devil a woman lives for after thirty: &s;he is only in other folks way. Shall you be at the a&s;&s;emb|ly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe not, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;why then how in the world can you contrive to pa&s;s your time?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In a manner that your Lord&s;hip will think very extraordinary,"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn; <Q REND="inline">"for the young lady <HI>reads.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha, ha, ha! Egad, my Lord,"</Q> cried the facetious companion, <Q REND="inline">"you are got into bad hands"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You had better, Madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he,
<PB N="96" REF="95">
<Q REND="inline">"attack Jack Coverley, here, for you will make nothing of me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of <HI>you,</HI> my Lord!"</Q> cried &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid I &s;hould ever entertain &s;o idle an expectati|on! I only talk, like a &s;illy woman, for the &s;ake of talking; but I have by no means &s;o low an opinion of your Lord&s;hip, as to &s;uppo&s;e you vulnerable to cen&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do pray, Ma'am,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"turn to Jack Coverley; he's the very man for you;&mdash;he'd be a wit him&s;elf if he was n't too mode&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Prithee, my Lord, be quiet,"</Q> returned the other; <Q REND="inline">if the Lady is contented to be&s;tow all her favours upon <HI>you,</HI> why &s;hould you make &s;uch a point of my going &s;nacks?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't be apprehen&s;ive, Gentlemen,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, drily, <Q REND="inline">"I am not romantic,&mdash;I have not the lea&s;t de&s;ign of doing good to either of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have not you been ill &s;ince I &s;aw you?"</Q> &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, again addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought &s;o; you are paler than you was, and I &s;uppo&s;e that's the rea&s;on I did not recollect you &s;ooner."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Has not your Lord&s;hip too much gallantry,"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">to di&s;cover a young lady's illne&s;s by her looks?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The devil a word can I &s;peak for that wo|man,"</Q> &s;aid he, in a low voice; <Q REND="inline">"do, prithee, Jack, take her in hand."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Excu&s;e me, my Lord!"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Coverley.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When &s;hall I &s;ee you again?"</Q> continued his Lord&s;hip; <Q REND="inline">"do you go to the pump-room every morning?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="96">
<Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you ride out?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then we arrived at the pump-room, and an end was put to our conver&s;ation, if it is not an abu&s;e of words to give &s;uch a term to a &s;tring of rude que&s;tions and free compliments.</P>
<P>He had not opportunity to &s;ay much more to me, as Mrs. Selwyn joined a large party, and I walked home between two ladies. He had how|ever, the curio&s;ity to &s;ee us to the door.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn was very eager to know how I had made acquaintance with this nobleman, who&s;e manners &s;o evidently announced the character of a confirmed libertine: I could give her very lit|tle &s;atisfaction, as I was ignorant even of his name. But, in the afternoon, Mr. Ridgeway, the apo|thecary, gave us very ample information.</P>
<P>As his per&s;on was ea&s;ily de&s;cribed, for he is remarkably tall, Mr. Ridgeway told us he was Lord Merton, a nobleman but lately come to his title, though he had already di&s;&s;ipated more than half his fortune: a profe&s;&s;ed admirer of beauty, but a man of mo&s;t licentious character: that among men, his companions con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of gamblers and jockies, and among women, he was rarely admitted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad I was not more civil to him. You may depend upon <HI>me</HI> for keeping him at a di&s;|tance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Ridgeway, <Q REND="inline">"he may now be admitted any where, for he is going to <HI>reform.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Has he, under that notion, per&s;uaded any fool to marry him?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="97">
<Q REND="inline">"Not yet, Madam, but a marriage is expect|ed to take place &s;hortly: it has been &s;ome time in agitation, but the friends of the Lady have ob|liged her to wait till &s;he is of age: however, her brother, who has chiefly oppo&s;ed the match, now that &s;he is near being at her own di&s;po&s;al, is tolerably quiet. She is very pretty, and will have a large fortune. We expect her at the Wells every day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is her name?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Larpent,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"Lady Loui&s;a Larpent, &s;i&s;ter of Lord Orville."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord Orville!"</Q> repeated I, all amazement.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Yes, Ma'am; his Lord&s;hip is coming with her. I have had certain information. They are to be at the honourable Mrs. Beaumont's. She is a re|lation of my Lord's, and has a very fine hou&s;e upon Clifton Hill."</Q></P>
<P><HI>His Lord&s;hip is coming with her!</HI>&mdash;Good God, what an emotion did tho&s;e words give me! How &s;trange, my dear Sir, that, ju&s;t at this time, he &s;hould vi&s;it Bri&s;tol! It will be impo&s;&s;ible for me to avoid &s;eeing him, as Mrs. Selwyn is very well acquainted with Mrs. Beaumont. Indeed, I have had an e&s;cape in not being under the &s;ame roof with him, for Mrs. Beaumont invited us to her hou&s;e immediately upon our arrival; but the in|conveniency of being &s;o di&s;tant from the pump|room made Mrs. Selwyn decline her civility.</P>
<P>Oh that the fir&s;t meeting was over!&mdash;or that I could quit Bri&s;tol without &s;eeing him!&mdash;inexpre&s;|&s;ibly do I dread an interview: &s;hould the &s;ame impertinent freedom be expre&s;&s;ed by his looks, which dictated his cruel letter, I &s;hall not know how to endure either him or my&s;elf. Had I but returned it, I &s;hould be ea&s;ier, becau&s;e my &s;enti|ments of it would then be known to him; but
<PB N="99" REF="98">
now, he can only gather them from my behavi|our, and I tremble le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;take my in|dignation for confu&s;ion!&mdash;le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;con|&s;true my re&s;erve into embarra&s;&s;ment!&mdash;for how, my deare&s;t Sir, how &s;hall I be able totally to di|ve&s;t my&s;elf of the re&s;pect with which I have been u&s;ed to think of him?&mdash;the plea&s;ure with which I have been u&s;ed to &s;ee him?</P>
<P>Surely he, as well as I, mu&s;t think of the letter at the moment of our meeting, and he will, pro|bably, mean to gather my thoughts of it from my looks;&mdash;oh that they could but convey to him my real dete&s;tation of impertinence and vanity! then would he &s;ee how much he had mi&s;|taken my di&s;po&s;ition when he imagined them my due.</P>
<P>There was a time, when the very idea that &s;uch a man as Lord Merton would ever be con|nected with Lord Orville, would have both &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked me, and even yet I am plea&s;ed to hear of his repugnance to the mar|riage.</P>
<P>But how &s;trange, that a man of &s;o abandoned a character &s;hould be the choice of a &s;i&s;ter of Lord Orville! and how &s;trange that, almo&s;t at the moment of the union, he &s;hould be &s;o im|portunate in gallantry to another woman! What a world is this we live in! how corrupt, how de|generate! well might I be contented to &s;ee no more of it! If I find that the <HI>eyes</HI> of Lord Orville agree with his <HI>pen,</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall then think, that of all mankind, the only virtuous individual re&s;ides at Berry Hill!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bri&s;tol Hotwells, <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OH Sir, Lord Orville is &s;till him&s;elf! &s;till, what from the moment I beheld, I believed him to be, all that was amiable in man! and your hap|py Evelina, re&s;tored at once to &s;pirits and tran|quility, is no longer &s;unk in her own opinion, nor di&s;contented with the world;&mdash;no longer, with dejected eyes, &s;ees the pro&s;pect of pa&s;&s;ing her fu|ture days in &s;adne&s;s, doubt, and &s;u&s;picion!&mdash;with revived courage &s;he now looks forward, and ex|pects to meet with goodne&s;s, even among man|kind;&mdash;though &s;till &s;he feels, as &s;trongly as ever, the folly of hoping, in any <HI>&s;econd</HI> in&s;tance, to meet with <HI>perfection.</HI></P>
<P>Your conjecture was certainly right; Lord Orville, when he wrote that letter, could not be in his &s;en&s;es. Oh that intemperance &s;hould have power to degrade &s;o low, a man &s;o noble!</P>
<P>This morning I accompanied Mrs. Selwyn to Clifton Hill, where, beautifully &s;ituated, is the hou&s;e of Mrs. Beaumont. Mo&s;t uncomfortable were my feelings during our walk, which was very &s;low, for the agitation of my mind made me more than u&s;ually &s;en&s;ible how weak I &s;till conti|nue. As we entered the hou&s;e, I &s;ummoned all my re&s;olution to my aid, determined rather to die than give Lord Orville rea&s;on to attribute my weakne&s;s to a wrong cau&s;e. I was happily reliev|ed from my perturbation, when I &s;aw Mrs. Beau|mont was alone. We &s;at with her for, I believe,
<PB N="101" REF="100">
an hour without interruption, and then we &s;aw a phaeton drive up to the gate, and a lady and gen|tleman alight from it.</P>
<P>They entered the parlour with the ea&s;e of peo|ple who were at home. The gentleman, I &s;oon &s;aw, was Lord Merton; he came &s;huffling into the room with his boots on, and his whip in his hand; and, having made &s;omething like a bow to Mrs. Beaumont, he turned towards me. His &s;ur|pri&s;e was very evident, but he took no manner of notice of me. He waited, I believe, to di&s;cover, fir&s;t, what chance had brought me to that hou&s;e, where he did not look much rejoiced at meeting me. He &s;eated him&s;elf very quietly at the win|dow, without &s;peaking to any body.</P>
<P>Mean time, the lady, who &s;eemed very young, hobbling rather than walking into the room, made a pa&s;&s;ing court&s;ie to Mrs. Beaumont, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"How are you, Ma'am?"</Q> and then, without noticing any body el&s;e, with an air of languor, &s;he flung her&s;elf upon a &s;ofa, prote&s;ting, in a mo&s;t affected voice, and &s;peaking &s;o &s;oftly &s;he could hardly be heard, that &s;he was fatigued to death. <Q REND="inline">"Really, Ma'am, the roads are &s;o mon&s;trous du&s;ty,&mdash;you can't imagine how trouble&s;ome the du&s;t is to one's eyes!&mdash;and the &s;un, too, is mon|&s;trous di&s;agreeable!&mdash;I dare &s;ay I &s;hall be &s;o tanned I &s;ha'n't be fit to be &s;een this age. Indeed, my Lord, I won't go out with you any more, for you don't care where you take one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon my honour,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton, <Q REND="inline">"I took you the plea&s;ante&s;t ride in England; the fault was in the &s;un not me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip is in the right,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"to transfer the fault to the <HI>&s;un,</HI> becau&s;e it has &s;o many excellencies to counterbalance par|tial
<PB N="102" REF="101">
inconveniencies, that a <HI>little</HI> blame will not in|jure <HI>that</HI> in our e&s;timation."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Merton looked by no means delighted at this attack; which I believe &s;he would not &s;o readily have made, but to revenge his neglect of us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you meet your brother, Lady Loui&s;a?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Ma'am. Is he rode out this morn|ing?"</Q></P>
<P>I then found, what I had before &s;u&s;pected, that this Lady was Lord Orville's &s;i&s;ter: how &s;trange, that &s;uch near relations &s;hould be &s;o different to each other! There is, indeed, &s;ome re&s;emblance in their features, but in their manners, not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"and I believe he wi&s;hed to &s;ee you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord drove &s;o mon&s;trous fa&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"that perhaps we pa&s;&s;ed him. He frighted me out of my &s;en&s;es; I declare my head is quite giddy. Do you know, Ma'am, we have done nothing but quarrel all the morning?&mdash;You can't think how I've &s;colded;&mdash;have not I, my Lord?"</Q> and &s;he &s;miled expre&s;&s;ively at Lord Merton.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have been, as you always are,"</Q> &s;aid he, twi&s;ting his whip with his fingers, <Q REND="inline">"all &s;weetne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O fie, my Lord,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I know you don't think &s;o; I know you think me very ill|natured;&mdash;don't you, my Lord?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, upon my honour;&mdash;how can your Lady&s;hip a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion? Pray how goes time? my watch &s;tands."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is almo&s;t three,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Beau|mont.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="102">
<Q REND="inline">"Lord, Ma'am, you frighten me!"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a; and then turning to Lord Merton, <Q REND="inline">"why now, you wicked creature, you, did not you tell me it was but one?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn then ro&s;e to take leave; but Mrs. Beaumont a&s;ked if &s;he would look at the &s;hrubbery. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould like it much,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but that I fear to fatigue Mi&s;s Anville."</Q></P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a then, rai&s;ing her head from her hand, on which it had leant, turned round to look at me, and, having fully &s;atisfied her curio&s;ity, without any regard to the confu&s;ion it gave me, turned about, and, again leaning on her hand, took no further notice of me.</P>
<P>I declared my&s;elf very able to walk, and begged that I might accompany them. <Q REND="inline">"What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> Lady Loui&s;a,"</Q> cried Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"to a &s;trole in the garden?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me, Ma'am!&mdash;I declare I can't &s;tir a &s;tep; the heat is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, it would kill me. I'm half dead with it already; be&s;ides, I &s;hall have no time to dre&s;s. Will any body be here to day, Ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe not, unle&s;s Lord Merton will fa|vour us with his company."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With great plea&s;ure, Madam."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, I declare you don't de&s;erve to be a&s;k|ed,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"you wicked creature, you!&mdash;I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> tell you one thing, Ma'am,&mdash;you can't think how abominable he was! do you know we met Mr. Lovel in his new phaeton, and my Lord was &s;o cruel as to drive again&s;t it?&mdash;we real|ly flew. I declare I could not breathe. Upon my word, my Lord, I'll never tru&s;t my&s;elf with you again,&mdash;I won't indeed!"</Q></P>
<P>We then went into the garden, leaving them to di&s;cu&s;s the point at their lei&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="103">
Do you remember a <HI>pretty but affected young la|dy</HI> I mentioned to have &s;een, in Lord Orville's party, at the Pantheon? How little did I then imagine her to be his &s;i&s;ter! yet Lady Loui&s;a Lar|pent is the very per&s;on. I can now account for the piqued manner of her &s;peaking to Lord Mer|ton that evening, and I can now account for the air of di&s;plea&s;ure with which Lord Orville mark|ed the undue attention of his future brother-in-law to me.</P>
<P>We had not walked long, ere, at a di&s;tance, I perceived Lord Orville, who &s;eemed ju&s;t di&s;|mounted from his hor&s;e, enter the garden, All my perturbation returned at the &s;ight of him!&mdash;yet I endeavoured to repre&s;s every feel|ing but re&s;entment. As he approached us, he bowed to the whole party; but I turned away my head, to avoid taking any &s;hare in his civi|lity. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf immediately to Mrs. Beaumont, he was beginning to enquire after his &s;i&s;ter, but upon &s;eeing my face, he &s;udden|ly exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Anville!&mdash;"</Q> and then he advanced, and made his compliments to me,&mdash;not with an air of vanity or impertinence, nor yet with a look of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or &s;hame,&mdash;but with a countenance open, manly, and charm|ing!&mdash;with a &s;mile that indicated plea&s;ure, and eyes that &s;parkled with delight! on <HI>my</HI> &s;ide was all the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, for by him, I really believe, the letter was, at that moment, entirely forgot|ten.</P>
<P>With what politene&s;s did he addre&s;s me! with what &s;weetne&s;s did he look at me! the very tone of his voice &s;eemed flattering! he congra|tulated him&s;elf upon his good fortune in meet|ing with me,&mdash;hoped I &s;hould &s;pend &s;ome time at Bri&s;tol, and enquired, even with anxiety en|quired,
<PB N="105" REF="104">
if my health was the cau&s;e of my journey, in which ca&s;e his &s;atisfaction would be converted into apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;truck as I was with his manner, and charmed to find him &s;uch as he was wont to be, imagine not, my dear Sir, that I forgot the re&s;entment I owe him, or the cau&s;e he has given me of di&s;plea&s;ure; no, my behaviour was &s;uch as, I hope, had you &s;een, you would not have di&s;approved: I was grave and di&s;tant, I &s;carce looked at him when he &s;poke, or an&s;wered him when he was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>As he mu&s;t certainly ob&s;erve this alteration in my conduct, I think it could not fail making him both recollect and repent the provocation he had &s;o cau&s;ele&s;sly given me: for &s;urely he was not &s;o wholly lo&s;t to rea&s;on, as to be now ignorant he had ever offended me.</P>
<P>The moment that, without ab&s;olute rudene&s;s, I was able, I turned entirely from him, and a&s;ked Mrs. Selwyn if we &s;hould not be late home. How Lord Orville looked I know not, for I avoided meeting his eyes, but he did not &s;peak another word as we proceeded to the garden-gate. Indeed I believe my abruptne&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed him, for he did not &s;eem to expect I had &s;o much &s;pirit. And, to own the truth, convinced as I was of the propriety, nay, ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;hewing my di&s;plea&s;ure, I yet almo&s;t hated my&s;elf for receiving his politene&s;s &s;o un|graciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>When we were taking leave, my eyes accident|ally meeting his, I could not but ob&s;erve that his gravity equalled my own, for it had entirely tak|en place of the &s;miles and good-humour with which he had met me.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="105">
<Q REND="inline">"I am afraid this young Lady,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"is too weak for another long walk till &s;he is again re&s;ted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If the Ladies will tru&s;t to my driving,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"and are not afraid of a phaeton, mine &s;hall be ready in a moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"but my will is yet un&s;igned, and I don't chu&s;e to venture in a phaeton with a young man while that is the ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"you need not be afraid of my Lord Orville, for he is remark|ably careful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;ay you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"I had much rather walk.&mdash;"</Q> But then, looking at Lord Orville, I perceived in his face a &s;urpri&s;e &s;o &s;erious at my abrupt refu&s;al, that I could not forbear adding, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;hould be &s;orry to occa&s;ion &s;o much trou|ble."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville brightening at the&s;e words, came forward, and pre&s;&s;ed his offer in a manner not to be denied;&mdash;&s;o the phaeton was ordered! And in|deed, my dear Sir,&mdash;I know not how it was,&mdash;but, from that moment, my coldne&s;s and re&s;erve in&s;en&s;ibly wore away! You mu&s;t not be angry;&mdash;it was my intention, nay, my endeavour, to &s;up|port them with firmne&s;s; but, when I formed the plan, I thought only of the letter,&mdash;not of Lord Orville;&mdash;and how is it po&s;&s;ible for re&s;entment to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without provocation? yet, believe me, my deare&s;t Sir, had he &s;u&s;tained the part he began to act when he wrote the ever-to-be regretted letter, your Evelina would not have forfeited her title to your e&s;teem, by contentedly &s;ubmitting to be treat|ed with indignity.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="106">
We continued in the garden till the phaeton was ready. When we parted from Mrs. Beau|mont, &s;he repeated her invitation to Mrs. Selwyn to accept an apartment in her hou&s;e, but the &s;ame rea&s;ons made it be again declined.</P>
<P>Lord Orville drove very &s;low, and &s;o cautiou&s;|ly, that, notwith&s;tanding the height of the phae|ton, fear would have been ridiculous. I &s;upport|ed no part in the conver&s;ation, but Mrs. Selwyn extremely well &s;upplied the place of two. Lord Orville him&s;elf did not &s;peak much, but the ex|cellent &s;en&s;e and refined good-breeding which ac|company every word he utters, give a <HI>ze&s;t</HI> to whatever he &s;ays.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"when we &s;topped at our lodgings, you would have been extremely confu&s;ed had we met any gentlemen who have the honour of knowing you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I had,"</Q> an&s;wered he, gallantly, <Q REND="inline">"it would have been from mere compa&s;&s;ion at their envy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"it would have been from mere &s;hame, that, in an age &s;o daring, you alone &s;hould be &s;uch a coward as to forbear to frighten women."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"when a man is in a fright for him&s;elf, the ladies cannot but be in &s;ecurity; for you have not had half the appre|hen&s;ion for the &s;afety of your per&s;ons, that I have for that of my heart."</Q></P>
<P>He then alighted, handed us out, took leave, and again mounting the phaeton, was out of &s;ight in a minute.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, when he was gone, <Q REND="inline">"there mu&s;t have been &s;ome mi&s;take in the birth of that young man; he was, undoubt|edly,
<PB N="108" REF="107">
de&s;igned for the la&s;t age; for, if you ob|&s;erved, he is really polite."</Q></P>
<P>And now, my dear Sir, do not you think, ac|cording to the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, I may give up my re&s;entment, without imprudence or impropriety? I hope you will not blame me. In|deed, had you, like me, &s;een his re&s;pectful beha|viour, you would have been convinced of the im|practicability of &s;upporting any further indigna|tion.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bri&s;tol Hotwells, <DATE>Sept. 19th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY morning, Mrs. Selwyn receiv|ed a card from Mrs. Beaumont, to a&s;k her to din|ner to-day; and another, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, came to me. The invitation was accepted, and we are but ju&s;t arrived from Clifton-Hill.</P>
<P>We found Mrs. Beaumont alone in the parlour. I will write you that lady's character, as I heard it from our &s;atirical friend Mrs. Selwyn, and in her own words. <Q REND="inline">"She is an ab&s;olute <HI>Court Calendar bigot;</HI> for, chancing her&s;elf to be born of a no|ble and ancient family, &s;he thinks proper to be of opinion, that <HI>birth</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> are one and the &s;ame thing. She has &s;ome good qualities, but they rather originate from pride than principle, as &s;he piques her&s;elf upon being too high born to be capable of an unworthy action, and thinks it incumbent upon her to &s;upport the dignity of her ance&s;try. Fortunately for the world in general,
<PB N="109" REF="108">
&s;he has taken it into her head, that conde&s;cen&s;ion is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing virtue of high life; &s;o that the &s;ame pride of family which renders others imperious, is with her the motive of affability. But her civility is too formal to be comfortable, and too mechanical to be flattering. That &s;he does <HI>me</HI> the honour of &s;o much notice, is merely owing to an accident which, I am &s;ure, is very painful to her remembrance; for it &s;o happened that I once did her &s;ome &s;ervice, in regard to an apartment, at Southampton; and I have &s;ince been informed, that, at the time &s;he accepted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he thought I was a woman of quality: and I make no doubt but &s;he was mi&s;erable when &s;he di&s;covered me to be a mere country gentlewo|man: however, her nice notions of decorum have made her load me with favours ever &s;ince. But I am not much flattered by her civilities, as I am convinced I owe them neither to attachment nor gratitude, but &s;olely to a de&s;ire of cancelling an obligation which &s;he cannot brook being under, to one who&s;e name is no where to be found in the Court Calendar."</Q></P>
<P>You well know, my dear Sir, the delight this lady takes in giving way to her &s;atirical humour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont received us very graciou&s;ly, though &s;he &s;omewhat di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me by the que&s;|tions &s;he a&s;ked concerning my family,&mdash;&s;uch as, whether I was related to the Anvilles in the North?&mdash;Whether &s;ome of my name did not live in Lincoln&s;hire? and many other enquiries, which much embarra&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, next, turned upon the in|tended marriage in her family. She treated the &s;ubject with re&s;erve, but it was evident &s;he di&s;ap|proved Lady Loui&s;a's choice. She &s;poke in terms of the highe&s;t e&s;teem of Lord Orville, calling
<PB N="110" REF="109">
him, in Marmontel's words, <HI>Un jeune homme comme il y en a peu.</HI></P>
<P>I did not think this conver&s;ation very agreeably interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Lovel. Indeed I am heartily &s;orry he is now at the Hot-wells. He made his compliments with the mo&s;t ob&s;equi|ous re&s;pect to Mrs. Beaumont, but took no &s;ort of notice of any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>In a few minutes Lady Loui&s;a Larpent made her appearance. The &s;ame manners prevailed; for court&s;ying, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you are well, Ma'am,"</Q> to Mrs. Beaumont, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;traight forward to her &s;eat on the &s;ofa, where leaning her head on her hand, &s;he ca&s;t her langui&s;hing eyes round the room, with a vacant &s;tare, as if determined, though &s;he looked, not to &s;ee who was in it.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovel, pre&s;ently approaching her with re|verence the mo&s;t profound, hoped her Lady&s;hip was not indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Lovel,"</Q> cried &s;he, rai&s;ing her head, <Q REND="inline">"I declare I did not &s;ee you: Have you been here long?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By my <HI>watch,</HI> Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"only five minutes,&mdash;but by your lady&s;hip's ab&s;ence, as many hours."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O! now I think of it,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I am very angry with you,&mdash;&s;o go along, do, for I &s;han't &s;peak to you all day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid your La'&s;hip's di&s;plea&s;ure &s;hould la&s;t &s;o long! in &s;uch cruel circum&s;tances, a day would &s;eem an age. But in what have I been &s;o unfortunate as to offend?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you half-killed me, the other morning, with terror! I have not yet recovered from my fright. How could you be &s;o cruel as to drive your phaeton again&s;t my Lord Merton's?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110">
<Q REND="inline">"'Pon honour, Ma'am, your La'&s;hip does me wrong; it was all owing to the hor&s;es,&mdash;there was no curbing them. I prote&s;t I &s;uffered more than your Lady&s;hip from the terror of alarming you."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then entered Lord Merton; &s;talking up to Mrs. Beaumont, to whom alone he bowed; he hoped he had not made her wait; and then ad|vancing to Lady Loui&s;a, &s;aid, in a carele&s;s man|ner, <Q REND="inline">"How is your Lady&s;hip this morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not well at all,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"I have been dying with the head-ach ever &s;ince I got up."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed!"</Q> cried he, with a countenance wholly unmoved, <Q REND="inline">"I am very unhappy to hear it. But &s;hould not your Lady&s;hip have &s;ome advice?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am quite &s;ick of advice,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Ridgeway has but ju&s;t left me,&mdash;but he has done me no good. Nobody here knows what is the matter with me, yet they all &s;ee how indif|ferent I am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lady&s;hip's con&s;titution,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lo|vel, <Q REND="inline">"is infinitely delicate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed it is,"</Q> cried &s;he, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">I am <HI>nerve</HI> all over!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am glad, however,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton, <Q REND="inline">"that you did not take the air this morning, for Coverly has been driving again&s;t me as if he was mad: he has got two of the fine&s;t &s;pirited hor&s;es I ever &s;aw."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, My Lord,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"why did not you bring Mr. Coverly with you? he's a droll creature; I like him mon&s;trou&s;ly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, he promi&s;ed to be here as &s;oon as me. I &s;uppo&s;e he'll come before dinner's over."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="111">
In the mid&s;t of this trifling conver&s;ation, Lord Orville made his appearance. O how dif|ferent was his addre&s;s! how &s;uperior did he look, and move, to all about him! Having paid his re&s;pects to Mrs. Beaumont, and then to Mrs. Selwyn, he came up to me, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I hope Mi&s;s Anville has not &s;uffered from the fatigue of Monday morning!"</Q> Then turning to Lady Loui&s;a, who &s;eemed rather &s;urpri&s;ed at his &s;peak|ing to me, he added, <Q REND="inline">"give me leave, &s;i&s;ter, to introduce Mi&s;s Anville to you."</Q></P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a, half-ri&s;ing, &s;aid, very coldly, that &s;he &s;hould be glad of the honour of know|ing me; and then, very abruptly turning to Lord Merton and Mr. Lovel, continued, in a half-whi&s;per, her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>For my part, I had ri&s;en and court&s;ied, and now, feeling very fooli&s;h, I &s;eated my&s;elf again; fir&s;t I had blu&s;hed at the unexpected politene&s;s of Lord Orville, and immediately afterwards, at the contemptuous failure of it in his &s;i&s;ter. How can that young Lady &s;ee her brother &s;o univer&s;ally admired for his manners and deport|ment, and yet be &s;o unamiably oppo&s;ite to him in her's!</P>
<P>Lord Orville, I am &s;ure, was hurt, and di&s;|plea&s;ed: he bit his lips, and turning from her, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf wholly to me, till we were &s;ummoned to dinner. Do you think I was not grateful for his attention? yes, indeed, and every angry idea I had entertained, was totally obli|terated.</P>
<P>As we were &s;eating our&s;elves at the table, Mr. Coverly came into the room: he made a thou&s;and apologies in a breath for being &s;o late, but &s;aid he had been retarded by a little accident, for that he had overturned his phaeton, and broke
<PB N="113" REF="112">
it all to pieces. Lady Loui&s;a &s;creamed at this intelligence, and looking at Lord Merton, declar|ed &s;he would never go into a phaeton again.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"never mind Jack Coverly, for he does not know how to drive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverly, <Q REND="inline">"I'll drive again&s;t <HI>you</HI> for a thou&s;and pounds."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Done!"</Q> returned the other; <Q REND="inline">"Name your day, and we'll each chu&s;e a judge."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;ooner the better,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverly; <Q REND="inline">"to-morrow, if the carriage can be repaired."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e enterpri&s;es,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"are very proper for men of rank, &s;ince 'tis a million to one but both parties will be incapacitated for any better employment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, changing colour, <Q REND="inline">"don't talk &s;o &s;hockingly! Pray, my Lord, pray, Mr. Coverly, don't alarm me in this manner."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Compo&s;e your&s;elf, Lady Loui&s;a,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"the gentlemen will think bet|ter of the &s;cheme; they are neither of them in earne&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The very mention of &s;uch a &s;cheme,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, taking out her &s;alts, <Q REND="inline">"makes me tremble all over! Indeed, my Lord, you have frightened me to death! I &s;han't eat a mor&s;el of dinner."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Permit me,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"to pro|po&s;e &s;ome other &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent, and we will di&s;cu&s;s this matter &s;ome other time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Brother, excu&s;e me; my Lord mu&s;t give me his word to drop this project,&mdash;for, I declare it has made me &s;ick as death."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To compromi&s;e the matter,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"&s;uppo&s;e, if both parties are unwil|ling to give up the bet, that, to make the ladies
<PB N="114" REF="113">
ea&s;y, we change its object to &s;omething le&s;s dan|gerous?"</Q></P>
<P>This propo&s;al was &s;o &s;trongly &s;econded by all the party, that both Lord Merton, and Mr. Co|verly, were obliged to comply with it: and it was then agreed that the affair &s;hould be finally &s;et|tled in the afternoon.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall now be entirely out of conceit with phaetons again,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"though Lord Orville had almo&s;t reconciled me to them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord Orville,</Q> "cried the witty Mr. Coverly, <Q REND="inline">"why, my Lord Orville is as careful,&mdash;egad, as careful as an old woman! Why, I'd drive a one-hor&s;e cart again&s;t my Lord's phaeton for a hundred guineas!"</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ally occa&s;ioned much laughter; for Mr. Coverly, I find, is regarded as a man of infinite humour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"you have not di&s;covered the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> my Lord Orville is &s;o careful?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, no, Ma'am; I mu&s;t own, I never heard any particular rea&s;on for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, I'll tell you; and I believe you will confe&s;s it to be <HI>very</HI> particular; his Lord&s;hip's friends are not yet tired of him."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville laughed and bowed. Mr. Cover|ly, a little confu&s;ed, turned to Lord Merton, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"No foul play, my Lord! I remember your Lord&s;hip recommended me to the notice of this Lady the other morning, and, egad, I be|lieve you have been doing me the &s;ame office to-day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Give you joy, Jack!"</Q> cried Lord Merton, with a loud laugh.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114">
After this, the conver&s;ation turned wholly up|on eating, a &s;ubject which was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t delight; and, had I not known they were men of rank and fa&s;hion, I &s;hould have imagined that Lord Merton, Mr. Lovel, and Mr. Coverly, had all been profe&s;&s;ed cooks; for they di&s;played &s;o much knowledge of &s;auces and made di&s;hes, and of the various methods of dre&s;|&s;ing the &s;ame things, that I am per&s;uaded they mu&s;t have given much time, and much &s;tudy, to make them&s;elves &s;uch adepts in this <HI>art.</HI> It would be very difficult to determine, whether they were mo&s;t to be di&s;tingui&s;hed as <HI>gluttons</HI> or <HI>epicures;</HI> for they were, at once, dainty and vo|racious, under&s;tood the right and the wrong of every di&s;h, and alike emptied the one and the other. I &s;hould have been quite &s;ick of their remarks, had I not been entertained by &s;eeing that Lord Orville, who, I am &s;ure, was equally di&s;gu&s;ted, not only read my &s;entiments, but, by his countenance, communicated to me his own.</P>
<P>When dinner was over, Mrs. Beaumont re|commended the gentlemen to the care of Lord Orville, and then attended the ladies to the draw|ing-room.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, till tea-time, was extreme|ly in&s;ipid; Mrs. Selwyn re&s;erved her&s;elf for the gentlemen, Mrs. Beaumont was grave, and Lady Loui&s;a languid.</P>
<P>But, at tea, every body revived; we were joined by the gentlemen, and gaiety took place of dulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Since I, as Mr. Lovel &s;ays, am <HI>Nobody</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 37.</NOTE>, I &s;eated my&s;elf quietly on a window, and not very
<PB N="116" REF="115">
near to any body: Lord Merton, Mr. Coverly, and Mr. Lovel, &s;everally pa&s;&s;ed me without no|tice, and &s;urrounded the chair of Lady Loui&s;a Larpent. I mu&s;t own, I was rather piqued at the behaviour of Mr. Lovel, as he had formerly known me. It is true, I mo&s;t &s;incerely de&s;pi&s;ed his foppery, yet I &s;hould be grieved to meet with <HI>contempt</HI> from any body. But I was by no means &s;orry to find that Lord Merton was determined not to know me before Lady Loui&s;a, as his ne|glect relieved me from much embarra&s;&s;ment. As to Mr. Coverly, his attention or di&s;regard were equally indifferent to me. Yet, altogether, I felt extremely uncomfortable, in finding my&s;elf con&s;idered in a light very inferior to the re&s;t of the company.</P>
<P>But, when Lord Orville appeared, the &s;cene changed: he came up &s;tairs la&s;t, and &s;eeing me &s;it alone, not only &s;poke to me directly, but drew a chair next mine, and honoured me with his entire attention.</P>
<P>He enquired very particularly after my health, and hoped I had already found benefit from the Bri&s;tol air. <Q REND="inline">"How little did I imagine,"</Q> ad|ded he, <Q REND="inline">"when I had la&s;t the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you in town, that ill health would, in &s;o &s;hort a time, have brought you hither! I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf for the &s;atisfaction I feel at &s;eeing you,&mdash;yet how can I help it!"</Q></P>
<P>He then enquired after the Mirvan family, and &s;poke of Mrs. Mirvan in terms of the mo&s;t ju&s;t prai&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"She is gentle and amiable,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"a true feminine character."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, indeed,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"and her &s;weet daughter, to &s;ay every thing of her at once, is ju&s;t the daughter &s;uch a mother de&s;erves."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="116">
<Q REND="inline">"I am glad of it,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"for both their &s;akes, as &s;uch near relations mu&s;t always reflect credit or di&s;grace on each other."</Q></P>
<P>After this, he began to &s;peak of the beauties of Clifton; but, in a few moments, was interrupt|ed by a call from the company, to di&s;cu&s;s the af|fair of the wager. Lord Merton and Mr. Co|verley, though they had been di&s;cour&s;ing upon the &s;ubject &s;ome time, could not fix upon any thing that &s;atisfied them both.</P>
<P>When they a&s;ked the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lord Orville, he propo&s;ed that every body pre&s;ent &s;hould vote &s;omething, and that the two gentlemen &s;hould draw lots which, from the &s;everal votes, &s;hould decide the bet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t then begin with the ladies,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville; and applied to Mrs. Selwyn.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With all my heart,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, with her u&s;ual readine&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"and, &s;ince the gentlemen are not allowed to ri&s;k their <HI>necks,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e we decide the bet by their <HI>heads?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By our heads?"</Q> cried Mr. Coverly; Egad, <Q REND="inline">"I dont under&s;tand you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will then explain my&s;elf more fully. As I doubt not but you are both excellent cla&s;&s;ics, &s;up|po&s;e, for the good of your own memories, and the entertainment and &s;urpri&s;e of the company, the thou&s;and pounds &s;hould fall to the &s;hare of him who can repeat by heart the longe&s;t ode of Horace?"</Q></P>
<P>Nobody could help laughing, the two gentle|men applied to, excepted; who &s;eemed, each of them, rather at a lo&s;s in what manner to receive this unexpected propo&s;al. At length Mr. Lovel, bowing low, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Will your Lord&s;hip plea&s;e to begin?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="117">
<Q REND="inline">"Devil take me if I do!"</Q> an&s;wered he, turn|ing on his heel, and &s;talking to the window.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, Gentlemen,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"why do you he&s;itate? I am &s;ure you cannot be afraid of a weak <HI>woman?</HI> Be&s;ides, if you &s;hould chance to be out, Mr. Lovel, I dare &s;ay, will have the goodne&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t you."</Q></P>
<P>The laugh, now, turned again&s;t Mr. Lovel, who&s;e change of countenance manife&s;ted no great plea&s;ure at the tran&s;ition.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me, Madam!"</Q> &s;aid he, colouring, <Q REND="inline">"no, "really I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o, Ma'am?&mdash;Why, really,&mdash;as to that,&mdash;'pon honour, Ma'am, you are rather&mdash;a little &s;evere;&mdash;for how is it po&s;&s;ible for a man who is in the Hou&s;e, to &s;tudy the cla&s;&s;ics? I a&s;|&s;ure you, Ma'am,"</Q> (with an affected &s;hrug) <Q REND="inline">"I find quite bu&s;ine&s;s enough for <HI>my</HI> poor head, in &s;tudying politics."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But, did you &s;tudy politics at &s;chool, and at the univer&s;ity?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At the univer&s;ity!"</Q> repeated he with an embarra&s;&s;ed look; <Q REND="inline">"why, as to that, Ma'am,&mdash;no, I can't &s;ay I did; but then, what with riding,&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and &s;o forth,&mdash;really, one has not much time, even at the univer&s;ity, for mere reading."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But to be &s;ure, Sir, you <HI>have</HI> read the cla&s;&s;ics?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O dear, yes, Ma'am!&mdash;very often,&mdash;but not very&mdash;not very lately."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Which of the odes do you recommend to the&s;e gentlemen to begin with?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Which of the odes!&mdash;Really, Ma'am, as to that, I have no very particular choice,&mdash;for,
<PB N="119" REF="118">
to own the truth, that Horace was never a very great favourite with me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In truth I believe you!"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, very drily.</P>
<P>Lord Merton, again advancing into the circle, with a nod and a laugh, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Give you joy, Lovel!"</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville next applied to Mrs. Beaumont for her vote.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It would very agreeably remind me of pa&s;t times,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">when <HI>bowing</HI> was in fa&s;hion, if the bet was to depend upon the be&s;t-made bow."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad, my Lord!"</Q> cried Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"there I &s;hould beat you hollow, for your Lord|&s;hip never bows at all.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And, pray Sir, do <HI>you?</HI></Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Do <HI>I,</HI> Ma'am?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"Why, only &s;ee!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have taken <HI>that</HI> for a <HI>&s;hrug,</HI> if you had not told me 'twas a bow."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverly, <Q REND="inline">"let's prac|ti&s;e;"</Q> and then, mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly, they pranced about the room, making bows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t now,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, turning to me, <Q REND="inline">"call upon Mi&s;s Anville."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"indeed I have nothing to propo&s;e."</Q> He would not, however, be refu&s;ed, but urged me &s;o much to &s;ay <HI>&s;omething,</HI> that at la&s;t, not to make him wait any longer, I ventured to propo&s;e an extempore couplet upon &s;ome given &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Coverley in&s;tantly made me a bow, or, ac|cording to Mrs. Selwyn, a <HI>&s;hrug,</HI> crying, <Q REND="inline">"Thank you, Ma'am; egad, that's my <HI>fort!</HI>&mdash;Why, my Lord, the Fates &s;eem again&s;t you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="119">
Lady Loui&s;a was then applied to; and every body &s;eemed eager to hear her opinion. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know what to &s;ay, I declare,"</Q> cried &s;he, affected|ly; <Q REND="inline">"can't you pa&s;s me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means!"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible your Lady&s;hip can make &s;o cruel a reque&s;t?"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"if your La|dy&s;hip does not help us in this dilemma, we &s;hall be forced to return to our phaetons."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, &s;creaming, <Q REND="inline">"you frightful creature, you, how can you be &s;o abo|minable!"</Q></P>
<P>I believe this trifling la&s;ted near half an hour; when at length, every body being tired, it was given up, and &s;he &s;aid &s;he would con&s;ider again&s;t another time.</P>
<P>Lord Orville now called upon Mr. Lovel, who, after about ten minutes deliberation, propo&s;ed, with a mo&s;t important face, to determine the wager by who &s;hould draw the longe&s;t &s;traw!</P>
<P>I had much difficulty to refrain laughing at this unmeaning &s;cheme; but &s;aw, to my great &s;ur|pri&s;e, not the lea&s;t change of countenance in any other per&s;on: and, &s;ince we came home, Mrs. Selwyn has informed me, that to <HI>draw &s;traws</HI> is a fa&s;hion of betting by no means uncommon! Good God! my dear Sir, does it not &s;eem as if money were of no value or &s;ervice, &s;ince tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;quander it away in a manner &s;o infi|nitely ab&s;urd!</P>
<P>It now only remained for Lord Orville to &s;peak; and the attention of the company &s;hewed the ex|pectations he had rai&s;ed; yet, I believe, they by no means prevented his propo&s;al from being heard with amazement; for it was no other, than that
<PB N="121" REF="120">
the money &s;hould be his due, who, according to the opinion of two judges, &s;hould bring the wor|thie&s;t object with whom to &s;hare it!</P>
<P>They all &s;tared, without &s;peaking. Indeed, I believe every one, for a moment at lea&s;t, expe|rienced &s;omething like &s;hame, from having either propo&s;ed or countenanced an extravagance &s;o u&s;e|le&s;s and frivolous. For my part, I was &s;o much &s;truck and affected by a rebuke &s;o noble to the&s;e &s;pendthrifts, that I felt my eyes filled with tears.</P>
<P>The &s;hort &s;ilence, and momentary reflection into which the company was &s;urpri&s;ed, Mr. Co|verly was the fir&s;t to di&s;pel, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Egad, my Lord, your Lord&s;hip has a mo&s;t remarkable odd way of taking things."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Faith,"</Q> &s;aid the incorrigible Lord Merton, <Q REND="inline">"if this &s;cheme takes, I &s;hall fix upon my Swi&s;s to &s;hare with me; for I dont know a worthier fel|low breathing."</Q></P>
<P>After a few more of the&s;e attempts at wit, the two gentlemen agreed that they would &s;ettle the affair the next morning.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then took a different turn, but I did not give it &s;ufficient attention to write any account of it. Not long after, Lord Orville re&s;uming his &s;eat next mine, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why is Mi&s;s Anville &s;o thoughtful?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"to con&s;i|der my&s;elf one among tho&s;e who have &s;o ju&s;tly in|curred your cen&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My cen&s;ure!&mdash;you amaze me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, you have made me quite a&s;hamed of my&s;elf, for having given my vote &s;o fooli&s;hly; when an opportunity offered, had I but, like your Lord&s;hip, had the &s;en&s;e to u&s;e it, of &s;hewing &s;ome humanity."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121">
<Q REND="inline">"You treat this too &s;eriou&s;ly,"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;mil|ing; <Q REND="inline">"and I hardly know if you do not now mean a rebuke to <HI>me.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To you, my Lord!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, which de&s;erves it mo&s;t, the one who adapts the conver&s;ation to the company, or the one who choo&s;es to be above it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, my Lord, who el&s;e would do you &s;o little ju&s;tice?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I flatter my&s;elf,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"that in fact, your opinion and mine, in this point, were the &s;ame, though you conde&s;cended to comply with the humour of the company. It is for me, therefore, to apologize for &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a gra|vity, which but for a particular intere&s;t which I now take in the affairs of Lord Merton, I &s;hould not have been &s;o officious to di&s;play."</Q></P>
<P>Such a compliment as this could not fail to re|concile me to my&s;elf; and with revived &s;pirits, I entered into a conver&s;ation, which he &s;upported with me till Mrs. Selwyn's carriage was announc|ed, and we returned home.</P>
<P>During our ride, Mrs. Selwyn very much &s;ur|pri&s;ed me, by a&s;king if I thought my health would now permit me to give up my morning walks to the pump-room, for the purpo&s;e of &s;pend|ing a week at Clifton? <Q REND="inline">"for this poor Mrs. Beau|mont,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is &s;o eager to have a di&s;|charge in full of her debt to me, that, out of mere compa&s;&s;ion, I am induced to li&s;ten to her. Be|&s;ides, &s;he has always a hou&s;e full of people, and though they are chiefly fools and coxcombs, yet there is &s;ome plea&s;ure in cutting them up."</Q></P>
<P>I begged I might not, by any means, prevent her following her inclination, as my health was now very well e&s;tabli&s;hed. And &s;o, my dear Sir, to|morrow
<PB N="123" REF="122">
we are to be, actually, the gue&s;ts of Mrs. Beaumont.</P>
<P>I am not much delighted at this &s;cheme; for, flattered as I am by the attention of Lord Orville, it is not very comfortable to be neglected by every body el&s;e. Be&s;ides, as I am &s;ure I owe the parti|cularity of his civility to a generous feeling for my &s;ituation, I cannot expect him to &s;upport it &s;o long as a week.</P>
<P>How often do I wi&s;h, &s;ince I am ab&s;ent from you, that I was under the protection of Mrs. Mirvan! It is true, Mrs. Selwyn is very obliging, and, in every re&s;pect, treats me as an equal; but &s;he is contented with behaving well her&s;elf, and does not, with a di&s;tingui&s;hing politene&s;s, rai&s;e and &s;upport me with others. Yet I mean not to blame her, for I know &s;he is &s;incerely my friend; but the fact is, &s;he is her&s;elf &s;o much occupied in conver&s;ation, when in company, that &s;he has neither lei&s;ure nor thought to attend to the &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Well, I mu&s;t take my chance! But I knew not, till now, how requi&s;ite are birth and fortune to the attainment of re&s;pect and civility.</P>

<P>How cruel is it, my dear Sir, to be thus expo&s;|ed to the impertinent &s;ugge&s;tions of a man who is determined to do me ill offices!

There has been company here all day; part of which I have &s;pent mo&s;t happily; for after tea, when the ladies played at cards, Lord Orville, who does not, and I who cannot, play, were con|&s;equently at our own di&s;po&s;al; and then his Lord|&s;hip entered into a conver&s;ation with me, which la&s;ted till &s;upper-time.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly, I find the con&s;traint, the re|&s;erve, I have been wont to feel in his pre&s;ence, wear away; the politene&s;s, the &s;weetne&s;s, with which he &s;peaks to me, re&s;tore all my natural chearfulne&s;s, and make me almo&s;t as ea&s;y as he is him&s;elf; and the more &s;o, as, if I may judge by his looks, I am rather rai&s;ed, than &s;unk, of late in his opinion.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, how the bet was, at la&s;t, to be decided? He told me, that, to his great &s;ati&s;|faction, the parties had been prevailed upon to lower the &s;um from one thou&s;and to one hundred pounds; and that they had determined it &s;hould be &s;ettled by a race between two old women, one cho&s;e by each &s;ide, and both of them to be proved more than eighty, though, in other re&s;pects, &s;trong and healthy as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>When I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e at this extraordi|nary method of &s;pending &s;o much money, <Q REND="inline">"I am charmed,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"at the novelty of meeting with one &s;o unhackneyed in the world, as not to be yet influenced by cu&s;tom to forget the u&s;e of rea&s;on: for certain it is, that the prevalence of fa|&s;hion makes the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities pa&s;s uncen&s;ur|ed, and the mind naturally accommodates it&s;elf even to the mo&s;t ridiculous improprieties, if they occur frequently."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have hoped,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"that the humane propo&s;al made ye&s;terday by your Lord|&s;hip, would have had more effect."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="125">
<Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"I was &s;o far from expecting any &s;ucce&s;s, that I &s;hall think my|&s;elf very fortunate if I e&s;cape the wit of Mr. Co|verley in a lampoon! yet I &s;poke openly, becau&s;e I do not wi&s;h to conceal that I am no friend to ga|ming."</Q></P>
<P>After this, he took up the New Bath Guide, and read it with me till &s;upper time. In our way down &s;tairs, Lady Loui&s;a &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I thought, Brother, you were engaged this evening?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Si&s;ter,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"and I <HI>have</HI> been engaged."</Q> And he bowed to me with an air of gallantry that rather confu&s;ed me.</P>

<P>Almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly have three days glided on &s;ince I wrote la&s;t, and &s;o &s;erenely, that, but for your ab&s;ence, I could not have formed a wi&s;h. My re&s;idence here is much happier than I had dared expect. The attention with which Lord Orville honours me is as uniform as it is flatter|ing, and &s;eems to re&s;ult from a benevolence of heart that proves him as much a &s;tranger to ca|price as to pride; for, as his particular civilities aro&s;e from a generous re&s;entment at &s;eeing me ne|glected, &s;o will they, I tru&s;t, continue as long as I &s;hall, in any degree, de&s;erve them. I am now not merely ea&s;y, but even gay in his pre&s;ence: &s;uch is the effect of true politene&s;s, that it bani&s;h|es all re&s;traint and embarra&s;&s;ment. When we walk out, he conde&s;cends to be my companion, and keeps by my &s;ide all the way we go. When we read, he marks the pa&s;&s;ages mo&s;t worthy to be noticed, draws out my &s;entiments, and favours me with his own. At table, where he always &s;its next to me, he obliges me by a thou&s;and namele&s;s attentions, while the di&s;tingui&s;hing good-breeding
<PB N="127" REF="126">
with which he treats me, prevents my repining at the vi&s;ibly-felt &s;uperiority of the re&s;t of the com|pany. A thou&s;and occa&s;ional meetings could not have brought us to that degree of &s;ocial freedom, which four days &s;pent under the &s;ame roof have, in&s;en&s;ibly, been productive of: and, as my only friend in this hou&s;e, Mrs. Selwyn, is too much engro&s;&s;ed in perpetual conver&s;ation to attend much to me, Lord Orville &s;eems to regard me as a help|le&s;s &s;tranger, and, as &s;uch, to think me entitled to his good offices and protection. Indeed, my dear Sir, I have rea&s;on to hope, that the depreciating opinion he formerly entertained of me is &s;uc|ceeded by one infinitely more partial.&mdash;It may be that I flatter my&s;elf, but yet his looks, his atten|tions, his de&s;ire of drawing me into conver&s;ation, and his &s;olicitude to oblige me, all con&s;pire to make me hope I do not. In &s;hort, my deare&s;t Sir, the&s;e la&s;t four happy days would repay me for months of &s;orrow and pain!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Clifton, <DATE>Sept. 24th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning I came down &s;tairs very early, and, &s;uppo&s;ing that the family would not a&s;&s;emble for &s;ome time, I &s;trolled out, purpo&s;ing to take a long walk, in the manner I was wont to do at Ber|ry Hill, before breakfa&s;t. But I had &s;carce &s;hut the garden gate, ere I was met by a gentleman, who, immediately bowing to me, I recollected
<PB N="128" REF="127">
to be the unhappy Mr. Macartney. Very much &s;urpri&s;ed, I court&s;ied, and &s;topped till he came up to me. He was &s;till in mourning, but looked bet|ter than when I &s;aw him la&s;t, though he had the &s;ame air of melancholy which &s;o much &s;truck me at fir&s;t &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>Addre&s;&s;ing me with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, <Q REND="inline">"I am happy, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to have met with you &s;o &s;oon. I came to Bri&s;tol but ye&s;terday, and have had no &s;mall difficulty in tracing you to Clifton."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you know, then, of my being here?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I did, Madam; the &s;ole motive of my jour|ney was to &s;ee you. I have been to Berry Hill, and there I had my intelligence, and, at the &s;ame time, the unwelcome information of your ill health."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God! Sir,&mdash;and can you po&s;&s;ibly have taken &s;o much trouble?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Trouble! Oh, Madam, could there be any, to return you, the moment I had the pow|er, my per&s;onal acknowledgments for your good|ne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P>I then enquired after Madame Duval, and the Snow-Hill family. He told me they were all well, and that Madame Duval propo&s;ed &s;oon re|turning to Paris. When I congratulated him up|on looking better, <Q REND="inline">"It is <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;hould congratulate, for to your hu|manity alone it may now be owing that I exi&s;t at all."</Q> He then told me, that his affairs were now in a le&s;s de&s;perate &s;ituation, and that he hoped, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of time and rea&s;on, to accommo|date his mind to a more chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his fate. <Q REND="inline">"The intere&s;t you &s;o generou&s;ly took in my affliction,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"a&s;&s;ures me you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to hear of my better fortune: I
<PB N="129" REF="128">
was therefore eager to acquaint you with it."</Q> He then told me, that his friend, the moment he had received his letter, quitted Paris, and flew to give him his per&s;onal a&s;&s;i&s;tance and con&s;olation. With a heavy heart, he acknowledged, he ac|cepted it; <Q REND="inline">"but yet,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"I <HI>have</HI> ac|cepted it, and therefore, as bound equally by du|ty and honour, my fir&s;t &s;tep was to ha&s;ten to the benefactre&s;s of my di&s;tre&s;s, and to return"</Q> (pre|&s;enting me &s;omething in a paper) <Q REND="inline">"the only part of my obligations that <HI>can</HI> be returned; for the re&s;t, I have nothing but my gratitude to offer, and mu&s;t always be contented to con&s;ider my&s;elf her debtor."</Q></P>
<P>I congratulated him mo&s;t &s;incerely upon his dawning pro&s;perity, but begged he would not de|prive me of the plea&s;ure of being his friend, and declined receiving the money, till his affairs were more &s;ettled.</P>
<P>While this point was in agitation, I heard Lord Orville's voice, enquiring of the gardener if he had &s;een me? I immediately opened the garden|gate, and his Lord&s;hip, advancing to me with quickne&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, Mi&s;s Anville, have you been out alone? Breakfa&s;t has been ready &s;ome time, and I have been round the garden in &s;earch of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip has been very good,"</Q> &s;aid I; <Q REND="inline">"but I hope you have not waited."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not waited!"</Q> repeated he &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"Do you think we could &s;it down quietly to breakfa&s;t, with the idea that you had run away from us? But come,"</Q> (offering to hand me) <Q REND="inline">"if we do not return, they will &s;uppo&s;e <HI>I</HI> am run away too; and they very naturally may, as they know the attrac|tion of the magnet that draws me."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="129">
<Q REND="inline">"I will come, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, rather em|barra&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"in two minutes."</Q> Then, turning to Mr. Macartney, with yet more embarra&s;&s;ment, I wi&s;hed him good morning.</P>
<P>He advanced towards the garden, with the pa|per &s;till in his hand.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome other time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May I then, Madam, have the honour of &s;eeing you again?</Q></P>
<P>I did not dare take the liberty of inviting any body to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Beaumont, nor yet had I the pre&s;ence of mind to make an excu&s;e; and therefore, not knowing how to refu&s;e him, I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps you may be this way again to-morrow morning,&mdash;and I believe I &s;hall walk out before breakfa&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>He bowed, and went away; while I, turning again to Lord Orville, &s;aw his countenance &s;o much altered, that I was &s;rightened at what I had &s;o ha&s;tily &s;aid. He did not again offer me his hand, but walked, &s;ilent and &s;low, by my &s;ide. Good Heaven! thought I, what may he not &s;up|po&s;e from this adventure? May he not, by my de&s;ire of meeting Mr. Macartney to-morrow, imagine it was by de&s;ign I walked out to meet him to-day? Tormented by this apprehen&s;ion, I de|termined to avail my&s;elf of the freedom which his behaviour &s;ince I came hither has encouraged; and, &s;ince he would not a&s;k any que&s;tions, begin an explanation my&s;elf. I therefore &s;lackened my peace, to gain time, and then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Was not your Lord&s;hip &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me &s;peaking with a &s;tranger?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A &s;tranger!'</Q> repeated he; <Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;&s;ible that gentleman can be a &s;tranger to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord,"</Q>&mdash;&s;aid I, &s;tammering, <Q REND="inline">"not to <HI>me,</HI>&mdash;but only it might look&mdash;he might &s;eem&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="130">
<Q REND="inline">"No, believe me,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a forced &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"I could never believe Mi&s;s Anville would make an appointment with a &s;tranger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An appointment, my Lord!"</Q> repeated I, colouring violently.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"but I thought I heard one."</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;o much confounded, that I could not &s;peak; yet, finding he walked quietly on, I could not endure he &s;hould make his own interpretation of my &s;ilence; and therefore, as &s;oon as I reco|vered from my &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, you are much mi&s;taken,&mdash;Mr. Macartney had particular bu&s;ine&s;s with me,&mdash;and I could not,&mdash;I knew not how to refu&s;e &s;eeing him,&mdash;but indeed, my Lord,&mdash;I had not,&mdash;he had not,&mdash;"</Q> I &s;tammered &s;o terribly that I could not go on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry,"</Q> &s;aid he, gravely, <Q REND="inline">"that I have been &s;o unfortunate as to di&s;tre&s;s you; but I &s;hould not have followed you, had I not imagined you were merely walked out for the air."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And &s;o I was!"</Q> cried I, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"indeed, my Lord, I was! My meeting with Mr. Ma|cartney was quite accidental; and if your Lord|&s;hip thinks there is any impropriety in my &s;ee|ing him to-morrow, I am ready to give up that intention."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If <HI>I</HI> think!"</Q> &s;aid he, in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e; <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely Mi&s;s Anville mu&s;t be&s;t judge for her&s;elf! &s;urely &s;he cannot leave the arbitration of a point &s;o delicate, to one who is ignorant of all the cir|cum&s;tances which attend it?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"it was worth your Lord&s;hip's time to hear them,&mdash;you &s;hould <HI>not</HI> be ignorant of the circum&s;tances which attend it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="131">
<Q REND="inline">"The &s;weetne&s;s of Mi&s;s Anville's di&s;po&s;iti|on,"</Q> &s;aid he, in a &s;oftened voice, <Q REND="inline">"I have long admired, and the offer of a communication which does me &s;o much honour, is too grateful to me not to be eagerly caught at."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, Mrs. Selwyn opened the parlour-win|dow, and our conver&s;ation ended. I was rallied upon my pa&s;&s;ion for &s;olitary walking, but no que&s;tions were a&s;ked me.</P>
<P>When breakfa&s;t was over, I hoped to have had &s;ome opportunity of &s;peaking with Lord Orville: but Lord Merton and Mr. Coverly came in, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his opinion of the &s;pot they had fixed upon for the old women's race. The ladies de|clared they would be of the party, and, accord|ingly, we all went.</P>
<P>The race is to be run in Mrs. Beaumont's gar|den; the two gentlemen are as anxious as if their joint lives depended upon it. They have, at length fixed upon objects, but have found great difficulty in per&s;uading them to practi&s;e running, in order to try their &s;trength. This grand affair is to be decided next Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>When we returned to the hou&s;e, the entrance of more company &s;till prevented my having any conver&s;ation with Lord Orville. I was very much chagrined, as I knew he was engaged at the Hotwells in the afternoon. Seeing, therefore, no probability of &s;peaking to him before the time of my meeting Mr. Macartney arrived, I determin|ed that, rather than ri&s;k his ill opinion, I would leave Mr. Macartney to his own &s;ugge&s;tions.</P>
<P>Yet, when I reflected upon his peculiar &s;ituati|on, his misfortunes, his &s;adne&s;s, and, more than all the re&s;t, the idea I knew he entertained of what he calls his obligations to me, I could not re|&s;olve upon a breach of promi&s;e, which might be
<PB N="133" REF="132">
attributed to cau&s;es of all others the mo&s;t offen&s;ive to one whom &s;orrow has made extremely &s;u&s;pici|ous of &s;lights and contempt.</P>
<P>After the mo&s;t unea&s;y con&s;ideration, I at length determined upon writing an excu&s;e, which would, at once, &s;ave me from either meeting or affront|ing him. I therefore begged Mrs. Selwyn's leave to &s;end her man to the Hotwells, which &s;he in|&s;tantly granted; and then I wrote the following note.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. Macartney.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it will not be in my power to walk out to|morrow morning, I would by no means give you the trouble of coming to Clifton. I hope, how|ever, to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you before you quit Bri&s;tol. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your obedient &s;ervant, EVELINA ANVILLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I de&s;ired the &s;ervant to enquire at the pump|room where Mr. Macartney lived, and returned to the parlour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the company di&s;per&s;ed, the ladies retired to dre&s;s. I then, unexpectedly, found my&s;elf alone with Lord Orville; who, the mo|ment I ro&s;e to follow Mrs. Selwyn, advanced to me, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Will Mi&s;s Anville pardon my impatience, if I remind her of the promi&s;e &s;he was &s;o good as to make me this morning?"</Q></P>
<P>I &s;topped, and would have returned to my &s;eat, but, before I had time, the &s;ervants came to lay the cloth. He retreated, and went towards the window; and while I was con&s;idering in what
<PB N="134" REF="133">
manner to begin, I could not help a&s;king my&s;elf what <HI>right</HI> I had to communicate the affairs of Mr. Macartney; and I doubted whether, to clear my&s;elf from one act of imprudence, I had not commited another.</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this reflection, I thought it be&s;t to quit the room, and give my&s;elf &s;ome time for con&s;ideration before I &s;poke; and therefore, only &s;aying I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to dre&s;s, I ran up &s;tairs: ra|ther abruptly, I own, and &s;o, I fear, Lord Or|ville mu&s;t think, yet what could I do? unu&s;ed to the &s;ituations in which I find my&s;elf, and embar|ra&s;&s;ed by the &s;lighte&s;t difficulties, I &s;eldom, till too late, di&s;cover how I ought to act</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we were all a&s;&s;embled to dinner, Mrs. Selwyn's man, coming into the parlour, pre&s;ented to me a letter, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I can't find out Mr. Macartney, Madam; but the po&s;t-office people will let you know if they hear of him."</Q></P>
<P>I was extremely a&s;hamed of this public me&s;|&s;age; and meeting the eyes of Lord Orville, which were earne&s;tly fixed on me, my confu&s;ion redoubled, and I knew not which way to look. All dinner-time, he was as &s;ilent as my&s;elf, and, the moment it was in my power, I left the table, and went to my own room. Mrs. Selwyn pre&s;ently followed me, and her que&s;tions obliged me to own almo&s;t all the particulars of my acquaintance with Mr. Macartney, in order to excu&s;e my writing to him. She &s;aid it was a mo&s;t romantic affair, and &s;poke her &s;entiments with great &s;everity, declaring that &s;he had no doubt but he was an adventurer and an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Sir, I am totally at a lo&s;s what I ought to do: the more I reflect, the more &s;en&s;ible I am of the utter impropriety, nay, treachery, of revealing the &s;tory, and publi&s;hing
<PB N="135" REF="134">
the misfortunes and poverty of Mr. Macartney; who has an undoubted right to my &s;ecrecy and di&s;cretion, and who&s;e letter charges me to regard his communication as &s;acred.&mdash;And yet, the ap|pearance of my&s;tery,&mdash;perhaps &s;omething wor&s;e, which this affair mu&s;t have to Lord Orville,&mdash;his &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;and the promi&s;e I have made him, are inducements &s;carce to be re&s;i&s;ted, for tru&s;ting him, with the openne&s;s he has rea&s;on to expect from me.</P>
<P>I am equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, too, whether or not I &s;hould &s;ee Mr. Macartney to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>Oh Sir, could I now be enlightened by your coun&s;el, from what anxiety and perplexity &s;hould I be relieved!</P>
<P>But no,&mdash;I ought not to betray Mr. Macartney, and I will not forfeit a confidence which would never have been repo&s;ed in me, but from a reli|ance upon my honour which I &s;hould blu&s;h to find my&s;elf unworthy of. De&s;irous as I am of the good opinion of Lord Orville, I will endeavour to act as if I was guided by your advice, and, making it my &s;ole aim to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> it, leave to time and to fate my &s;ucce&s;s or di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Since I have formed this re&s;olution, my mind is more at ea&s;e, but I will not fini&s;h my letter till the affair is decided.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sept. 25th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I ro&s;e very early this morning, and, after a thou&s;and different plans, not being able to re&s;olve upon giving poor Mr. Macartney leave to &s;uppo&s;e I neglected him, I thought it incumbent upon me to keep my word, &s;ince he had not received my letter; I therefore determined to make my own
<PB N="136" REF="135">
apologies, not to &s;tay with him two minutes, and to excu&s;e my&s;elf from meeting him any more.</P>
<P>Yet, uncertain whether I was wrong or right, it was with fear and trembling that I opened the garden-gate,&mdash;judge, then, of my feelings, when the fir&s;t object I &s;aw was Lord Orville!&mdash;he, too, looked extremely di&s;concerted, and &s;aid, in a he &s;itating manner, <Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Madam,&mdash;I did not imagine you would have been here &s;o &s;oon,&mdash;or,&mdash;or I would not have come."</Q>&mdash;And then, with a ha&s;ty bow, he pa&s;&s;ed me, and proceeded to the garden.</P>
<P>I was &s;carce able to &s;tand, &s;o greatly did I feel my&s;elf &s;hocked; but, upon my &s;aying, almo&s;t involuntarily, <Q REND="inline">"Oh my Lord!"</Q>&mdash;he turned back, and, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Did you &s;peak to <HI>me,</HI> Madam?"</Q></P>
<P>I could not immediately an&s;wer; I &s;eemed <HI>choaked,</HI> and was even forced to &s;upport my&s;elf by the garden-gate.</P>
<P>Lord Orville, &s;oon recovering his dignity, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I know not how to apologi&s;e for being, ju&s;t now, at this place;&mdash;and I cannot immediately,&mdash;if <HI>ever,</HI>&mdash;clear my&s;elf from the imputation of im|pertinent curio&s;ity, to which I fear you will attri|bute it: however, I will, at pre&s;ent, only entreat your pardon, without detaining you any longer."</Q> Again he bowed, and left me.</P>
<P>For &s;ome moments, I remained fixed to the &s;ame &s;pot, and in the &s;ame po&s;ition, immovably, as if I had been transformed to &s;tone.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t impul&s;e was to call him back, and in|&s;tantly tell him the whole affair; but I checked this de&s;ire, though I would have given the world to have indulged it; &s;omething like pride aided what I thought due to Mr. Macartney, and I de|termined not only to keep his &s;ecret, but to delay
<PB N="137" REF="136">
any &s;ort of explanation, till Lord Orville &s;hould conde&s;cend to reque&s;t it.</P>
<P>Slowly he walked, and before he entered the hou&s;e, he looked back, but ha&s;tily withdrew his eyes, upon finding I ob&s;erved him.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Sir, you cannot ea&s;ily ima|gine a &s;ituation more uncomfortable than mine was at that time; to be &s;u&s;pected by Lord Or|ville of any clande&s;tine actions, wounded my &s;oul; I was too much di&s;compo&s;ed to wait for Mr. Macartney, nor, in truth, could I endure to have the de&s;ign of my &s;taying &s;o well known. Yet, &s;o extremely was I agitated, that I could hardly move, and, I have rea&s;on to believe, Lord Orville, from the parlour window, &s;aw me totter|ing along, for, before I had taken five &s;teps, he came out, and ha&s;tening to me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I fear you are not well; pray allow me, (offering his arm) to a&s;&s;i&s;t you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, with all the re&s;olu|tion I could a&s;&s;ume; yet I was affected by an attention, at that time, &s;o little expected, and forced to turn away my head to conceal my emotion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You <HI>mu&s;t,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid he, with earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"in|deed you mu&s;t,&mdash;I am &s;ure you are not well;&mdash;refu&s;e me not the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting you;</Q> and, almo&s;t forcibly he took my hand, and drawing it under his arm, obliged me to lean upon him. That I &s;ubmitted, was partly the effect of &s;ur|pri&s;e at an earne&s;tne&s;s &s;o uncommon in Lord Orville, and partly, that I did not ju&s;t then, dare tru&s;t my voice to make any objection.</P>
<P>When we came to the hou&s;e, he led me into the parlour, and to a chair, and begged to know if I would not have a gla&s;s of water.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="137">
<Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord, I thank you,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"I am perfectly recovered;"</Q> and, ri&s;ing, I walked to the window, where, for &s;ome time, I pretend|ed to be occupied in looking at the garden.</P>
<P>Determined as I was to act honourably by Mr. Macartney, I yet mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed to be re&s;tored to the good opinion of Lord Orville; but his &s;ilence, and the thoughtfulne&s;s of his air, di&s;couraged me from &s;peaking.</P>
<P>My &s;ituation &s;oon grew di&s;agreeable and em|barra&s;&s;ing, and I re&s;olved to return to my cham|ber till breakfa&s;t was ready. To remain longer, I feared, might &s;eem <HI>a&s;king</HI> for his enquiries; and I was &s;ure it would ill become me to be more ea|ger to &s;peak, than he was to hear.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I reached the door, turning to me, ha&s;tily, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Are you going, Mi&s;s An|ville?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am, my Lord,"</Q> an&s;wered I, yet I &s;top|ped.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps to return to&mdash;but I beg your par|don!"</Q> he &s;poke with a degree of agitation that made me readily comprehend he meant to <HI>the garden,</HI> and I in&s;tantly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"To my own room, my Lord."</Q> And again I would have gone; but, convinced by my an&s;wer that I un|der&s;tood him, I believe he was &s;orry for the in&s;i|nuation; he approached me with a very &s;erious air, though, at the &s;ame time, he forced a &s;mile, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I know not what evil genius pur&s;ues me this morning, but I &s;eem de&s;tined to do or &s;ay &s;omething I ought not: I am &s;o much a&s;ham|ed of my&s;elf, that I can &s;carce &s;olicit your for|givene&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My forgivene&s;s! my Lord?"</Q> cried I, aba&s;h|ed, rather than elated by his conde&s;cen&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ure|ly you cannot,&mdash;you are not &s;erious?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="138">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed never more &s;o; yet, if I may be my own interpreter, Mi&s;s Anville's countenance pro|nounces my pardon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not, my Lord, how any one can pardon, who has never been offended."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good; yet I could expect no le&s;s from a &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition which baffles all compari&s;on: will you not think I am an en|croacher, and that I take advantage of your good|ne&s;s, &s;hould I once more remind you of the pro|mi&s;e you vouch&s;afed me ye&s;terday?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed; on the contrary, I &s;hall be very happy to acquit my&s;elf in your Lord&s;hip's opinion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Acquittal you need not,"</Q> &s;aid he, leading me again to the window, <Q REND="inline">"yet I own my curio|&s;ity is &s;trongly excited."</Q></P>
<P>When I was &s;eated, I found my&s;elf much at a lo&s; what to &s;ay; yet, after a &s;hort &s;ilence, a&s;|&s;uming all the courage in my power, <Q REND="inline">"Will you not, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"think me trifling and capricious, &s;hould I own I have repented the promi&s;e I made, and &s;hould I entreat your Lord|&s;hip not to in&s;i&s;t upon my &s;trict performance of it?&mdash;I &s;poke &s;o ha&s;tily, that I did not, at the time, con&s;ider the impropriety of what I &s;aid"</Q></P>
<P>As he was entirely &s;ilent, and profoundly at|tentive, I continued to &s;peak without interrup|tion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If your Lord&s;hip, by any other means, knew the circum&s;tances attending my acquain|tance with Mr. Macartney, I am mo&s;t &s;ure you would your&s;elf di&s;approve my relating them. He is a gentleman, and has been very unfortu|nate,&mdash;but I am not,&mdash;I think not,&mdash;at liberty to &s;ay more: yet I am &s;ure, if he knew your Lord|&s;hip
<PB N="140" REF="139">
wi&s;hed to hear any particulars of his affairs, he would readily con&s;ent to my acknowledging them;&mdash;&s;hall, my Lord, a&s;k his permi&s;&s;ion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>His</HI> affairs,"</Q> repeated Lord Orville; <Q REND="inline">"by no means, I have not the lea&s;t curio&s;ity about them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your Lord&s;hip's pardon,&mdash;but indeed I had under&s;tood the contrary."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible, Madam, you could &s;uppo&s;e the affairs of an utter &s;tranger can excite my cu|rio&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P>The gravity and coldne&s;s with which he a&s;ked this que&s;tion, very much aba&s;hed me; but Lord Orville is the mo&s;t delicate of men, and pre&s;ently recollecting him&s;elf, he added, <Q REND="inline">"I mean not to &s;peak with indifference of any friend of yours,&mdash;far from it; any &s;uch will always command my good wi&s;hes: yet I own I am rather di&s;appoint|ed; and though I doubt not the ju&s;tice of your rea&s;ons, to which I implicitly &s;ubmit, you mu&s;t not wonder, that when, upon the point of being honoured with your confidence, I &s;hould feel the greate&s;t regret at finding it withdrawn."</Q></P>
<P>Do you think, my dear Sir, I did not, at that moment, require all my re&s;olution to guard me from frankly telling him whatever he wi&s;hed to hear? yet I rejoice that I did not; for, added to the actual wrong I &s;hould have done, Lord Or|ville him&s;elf, when he had heard, would, I am &s;ure, have blamed me. Fortunately, this thought occurred to me, and I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip &s;hall your&s;elf be my judge; the pro|mi&s;e I made, though voluntary, was ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate; yet, had it concerned my&s;elf, I would not have he&s;itated in fulfilling it; but the gentleman who&s;e affairs I &s;hould be obliged to re|late&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="140">
<Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"for interrupting you; yet allow me to a&s;&s;ure you, I have not the &s;lighte&s;t de&s;ire to be acquainted with his affairs, further than what belongs to the motives which induced you ye&s;terday morning&mdash;"</Q> He &s;topped; but there was no occa&s;ion to &s;ay more.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"I will tell you hone&s;ty. Mr. Macartney had &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s with me,&mdash;and I could not take the liber|ty to a&s;k him hither."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why not?&mdash;Mrs. Beaumont, I am &s;ure,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could not, my Lord, think of intruding upon Mrs. Beaumont's complai&s;ance; and &s;o, with the &s;ame ha&s;ty folly I promi&s;ed your Lord|&s;hip, I much <HI>more</HI> ra&s;hly, promi&s;ed to meet him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And did you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, colouring, <Q REND="inline">"I re|turned before he came."</Q></P>
<P>Again, for &s;ome time, we were both &s;ilent; yet, unwilling to leave him to reflections which could not but be to my di&s;advantage, I &s;ummoned &s;ufficient courage to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"There is no young creature, my Lord, who &s;o greatly wants, or &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hes for, the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her friends, as I do; I am new to the world, and unu&s;ed to acting for my&s;elf,&mdash;my intentions are never wilfully blameable, yet I err perpetually!&mdash;I have hitherto, been ble&s;t with the mo&s;t affecti|onate of friends, and, indeed, the able&s;t of men, to guide and in&s;truct me upon every occa&s;ion;&mdash;but he is too di&s;tant, now, to be applied to at the moment I want his aid; and <HI>here,</HI>&mdash;there is not a human being who&s;e coun&s;el I can a&s;k!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> cried he, with a coun|tenance from which all coldne&s;s and gravity were

bani&s;hed, and &s;ucceeded by the milde&s;t benevo|lence, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>I</HI> were worthy,&mdash;and capable,&mdash;of &s;upplying the place of &s;uch a friend to Mi&s;s Anville!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do me but too much honour,"</Q> &s;aid I; <Q REND="inline">"yet I hope your Lord&s;hip's candour,&mdash;perhaps I ought to &s;ay indulgence,&mdash;will make &s;ome al|lowance, on account of my inexperience, for be|haviour &s;o incon&s;iderate:&mdash;May I, my Lord, hope that you will?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May <HI>I,</HI>"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"hope that you will pardon the ill-grace with which I have &s;ubmitted to my di&s;appointment? and that you will permit me,"</Q> (ki&s;&s;ing my hand) <Q REND="inline">"thus to &s;eal my peace?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Our</HI> peace, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, with revived &s;pirits.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This, then,"</Q> &s;aid he, again pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips, <Q REND="inline">"for <HI>our</HI> peace: and now,&mdash;are we not friends?"</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, the door opened, and I had only time to withdraw my hand, ere the ladies came in to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>I have been, all day, the happie&s;t of human beings!&mdash;to be thus reconciled to Lord Orville, and yet to adhere to my re&s;olution,&mdash;what could I wi&s;h for more?&mdash;he too, has been very chear|ful, and more attentive, more obliging to me than ever.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill, <DATE>Sept. 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DEAD to the world, and equally in&s;en&s;ible to its plea&s;ures or its pains, I long &s;ince bid adieu to all joy, and defiance to all &s;orrow, but what &s;hould &s;pring from my Evelina,&mdash;&s;ole &s;ource, to me, of all earthly felicity. How &s;trange, then, is it, that the letter in which &s;he tells me &s;he is the <HI>happie&s;t of human beings,</HI> &s;hould give me the mo&s;t mortal inquietude!</P>
<P>Alas, my child!&mdash;that innocence, the fir&s;t, be&s;t gift of Heaven, &s;hould, of all others, be the blinde&s;t to its own danger,&mdash;the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to treachery,&mdash;and the lea&s;t able to defend it&s;elf, in a world where it is little known, le&s;s valued, and perpe|tually deceived.</P>
<P>Would to Heaven you were here!&mdash;then, by degrees, and with gentlene&s;s, I might enter upon a &s;ubject too delicate for di&s;tant di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Yet it is too intere&s;ting, and the &s;ituation too critical, to allow of delay.&mdash;Oh my Evelina, your &s;itu|ation is critical indeed!&mdash;your peace of mind is at &s;take, and every chance for your future happine&s;s may depend upon the conduct of the pre&s;ent mo|ment.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have forborne to &s;peak with you upon the mo&s;t important of all concerns, the &s;tate of your heart:&mdash;alas, I needed no information! I have been &s;ilent, indeed, but I have not been blind.</P>
<P>Long, and with the deepe&s;t regret, have I per|ceived
<PB N="144" REF="143">
the a&s;cendency which Lord Orville has gained upon your mind.&mdash;You will &s;tart at the mention of his name,&mdash;you will tremble every word you read;&mdash;I grieve to give pain to my gen|tle Evelina, but I dare not any longer &s;pare her.</P>
<P>Your fir&s;t meeting with Lord Orville was de|ci&s;ive. Lively, fearle&s;s, free from all other impre&s;|&s;ions, &s;uch a man as you de&s;cribe him could not fail exciting your admiration, and the more dange|rou&s;ly, becau&s;e he &s;eemed as uncon&s;cious of his power as you of your weakne&s;s; and therefore you had no alarm, either from <HI>his</HI> vanity, or <HI>your own</HI> prudence.</P>
<P>Young, animated, entirely off your guard, and thoughtle&s;s of con&s;equences, <HI>imagination</HI> took the reins, and <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> &s;low-paced, though &s;ure-foot|ed, was unequal to a race with &s;o eccentric and flighty a companion. How rapid was then my Eve|lina's progre&s;s through tho&s;e regions of fancy and pa&s;&s;ion whither her new guide conducted her!&mdash;She &s;aw Lord Orville at a ball,&mdash;and he was <HI>the mo&s;t amiable of men!</HI>&mdash;She met him again at ano|ther,&mdash;and <HI>he had every virtue under Heaven!</HI></P>
<P>I mean not to depreciate the merit of Lord Or|ville, who, one my&s;terious in&s;tance alone ex|cepted, &s;eems to have de&s;erved the idea you form|ed of his character; but it was not time, it was not the knowledge of his worth, obtained your regard; your new comrade had not patience to wait any trial; her glowing pencil, dipt in the vivid colours of her creative ideas, painted to you, at the moment of your fir&s;t acquaintance, all the excellencies, all the good and rare qualities, which a great length of time, and intimacy, could alone have really di&s;covered.</P>
<P>You flattered your&s;elf, that your partiality was the effect of e&s;teem, founded upon a general love
<PB N="145" REF="144">
of merit, and a principle of ju&s;tice; and your heart, which fell the &s;acrifice of your error, was totally gone ere you &s;u&s;pected it was in danger.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and times have I been upon the point of &s;hewing you the perils of your &s;ituation; but the &s;ame inexperience which occa&s;ioned your mi&s;|take, I hoped, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of time and ab|&s;ence, would effect a cure: I was, indeed, mo&s;t unwilling to de&s;troy your illu&s;ion, while I dared hope it might it&s;elf contribute to the re&s;toration of your tranquillity; &s;ince your ignorance of the danger and force of your attachment, might po&s;|&s;ibly prevent that de&s;pondency with which young people, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, are apt to per|&s;uade them&s;elves that what is only difficult, is ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But now, &s;ince you have again met, and are become more intimate than ever, all my hope from &s;ilence and &s;eeming ignorance is at an end.</P>
<P>Awake, then, my dear, my deluded child, awake to the &s;en&s;e of your danger, and exert your|&s;elf to avoid the evils with which it threatens you,&mdash;evils which, to a mind like yours, are mo&s;t to be dreaded, &s;ecret repining, and concealed, yet con&s;uming regret! Make a noble effort for the re|covery of your peace, which now, with &s;orrow I &s;ee it, depends wholly upon the pre&s;ence of Lord Orville. This effort, may, indeed, be pain|ful, but tru&s;t to my experience, when I a&s;&s;ure you it is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t quit him!&mdash;his &s;ight is baneful to your repo&s;e, his &s;ociety is death to your future tranquillity! Believe me, my beloved child, my heart aches for your &s;uffering, while it dictates its nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Could I flatter my&s;elf that Lord Orville would, indeed, be &s;en&s;ible of your worth, and act with a
<PB N="146" REF="145">
noblene&s;s of mind, which &s;hould prove it reci|procal, then would I leave my Evelina to the un|mole&s;ted enjoyment of the chearful &s;ociety and in|crea&s;ing regard of a man &s;he &s;o greatly admires; but this is not an age in which we may tru&s;t to appearances, and imprudence is much &s;ooner re|gretted than repaired. Your health, you tell me, is much mended,&mdash;can you then con&s;ent to leave Bri&s;tol?&mdash;not abruptly, that I do not de&s;ire, but in a few days from the time you receive this? I will write to Mrs. Selwyn, and tell her how much I wi&s;h your return; and Mrs. Clinton can take &s;ufficient care of you.</P>
<P>I have meditated upon every po&s;&s;ible expedient that might tend to your happine&s;s, ere I fixed upon exacting from you a compliance which I am con|vinced will be mo&s;t painful to you; but I can &s;a|tisfy my&s;elf in none. This will at lea&s;t be &s;afe, and as to &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;we mu&s;t leave it to time.</P>
<P>I am very glad to hear of Mr. Macartney's wel|fare.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t child; Heaven pre&s;erve and &s;trengthen you!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Clifton, <DATE>Sept. 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SWEETLY, mo&s;t &s;weetly, have two days more pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince I wrote; but I have been too much engaged to be exact in my journal.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="146">
To-day has been le&s;s tranquil. It was de&s;tined for the deci&s;ion of the important bet, and has been productive of general confu&s;ion throughout the hou&s;e. It was &s;ettled that the race &s;hould be run at five o'clock in the afternoon. Lord Mer|ton breakfa&s;ted here, and &s;tayed till noon. He wanted to engage the ladies to <HI>bet on his &s;ide,</HI> in the true &s;pirit of gaming, without &s;eeing the ra|cers. But he could only prevail on Lady Loui&s;a, as Mrs. Selwyn &s;aid &s;he never laid a wager again&s;t her own wi&s;hes, and Mrs. Beaumont would not <HI>take &s;ides.</HI> As for <HI>me,</HI> I was not applied to. It is impo&s;&s;ible for negligence to be more pointed, than that of Lord Merton to me, in the pre&s;ence of Lady Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>But, ju&s;t before dinner, I happened to be alone in the drawing-room, when his Lord&s;hip &s;uddenly returned, and coming in with his u&s;ual familiarity, he was beginning, <Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee, Lady Loui&s;a,&mdash;"</Q> but &s;topping &s;hort, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, where's every body gone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed I don't know, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P>He then &s;hut the door, and, with a great alter|ation in his face and manner, advanced eagerly towards me, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How glad I am, my &s;weet girl, to meet you, at la&s;t, alone! By my &s;oul, I began to think there was a plot again&s;t me, for I've never been able to have you a minute to my&s;elf."</Q> And, very freely, he &s;eized my hand.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at this addre&s;s, after having been &s;o long totally neglected, that I could make no other an&s;wer than &s;taring at him with un|feigned a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why now,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"if you was not the cruelle&s;t little angel in the world, you would have helped me to &s;ome expedient: for you &s;ee how I am watched here; Lady Loui&s;a's
<PB N="148" REF="147">
eyes are never off me. She gives me a charming foreta&s;te of the plea&s;ures of a wife! however, it won't la&s;t long."</Q></P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted to the greate&s;t degree, I attempted to draw away my hand, but I believe I &s;hould not have &s;ucceeded, had not Mrs. Beaumont made her appearance. He turned from me with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How are you, Ma'am?&mdash;how is Lady Loui&s;a?&mdash;you &s;ee I can't live a moment out of the hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Could you, my deare&s;t Sir, have believed it po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch effrontery to be in man?</P>
<P>Before dinner, came Mr. Coverley, and before five o'clock, Mr. Lovel and &s;ome other company. The place marked out for the race, was a gravel|walk in Mrs. Beaumont's garden, and the length of the ground twenty yards. When we were &s;ummoned to the <HI>cour&s;e,</HI> the two poor old women made their appearance. Though they &s;eemed very healthy for their time of life, they yet looked &s;o weak, &s;o infirm, &s;o feeble, that I could feel no &s;en&s;ation but that of pity at the &s;ight. However, this was not the general &s;en&s;e of the company, for they no &s;ooner came forward, than they were greeted with a laugh from every beholder, Lord Orville excepted, who looked very grave during the whole tran&s;action. Doubtle&s;s he mu&s;t be greatly di&s;|contented at the di&s;&s;ipated conduct and extrava|gance, of a man with whom he is, &s;oon, to be &s;o nearly connected.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, the &s;cene was truly ridiculous; the agitation of the parties concerned, and the bets that were laid upon the old women, were ab&s;urd beyond mea&s;ure. <HI>Who are you for?</HI> and <HI>who&s;e &s;ide are you of?</HI> was echoed from mouth to mouth by the whole company. Lord Merton and Mr. Coverley were both &s;o exce&s;&s;ively gay and noi&s;y,
<PB N="149" REF="148">
that I &s;oon found they had been too free in drink|ing to their &s;ucce&s;s. They handed, with loud &s;houts, the old women to the race-ground, and encouraged them, by liberal promi&s;es, to exert them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When the &s;ignal was given them to &s;et off, the poor creatures, &s;eeble and frightened, ran again&s;t each other, and, neither of them able to &s;upport the &s;hock, they both fell on the ground.</P>
<P>Lord Merton and Mr. Coverley flew to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Seats were brought for them, and they each drank a gla&s;s of wine. They complained of being much brui&s;ed, for, heavy and helple&s;s, they had not been able to &s;ave them&s;elves, but fell with their whole weight upon the gravel. However, as they &s;eemed equal &s;ufferers, both parties were too eager to have the affair deferred.</P>
<P>Again, therefore, they &s;et off, and hobbled along, nearly even with each other, for &s;ome time, yet frequently, and to the inexpre&s;&s;ible di|ver&s;ion of the company, they &s;tumbled and tot|tered; and the confu&s;ed hallowing of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Now Co|verley!</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Now Merton!</HI>"</Q> rung from &s;ide to &s;ide during the whole affair.</P>
<P>Not long after, a foot of one of the poor wo|men &s;lipt, and, with great force, &s;he came again to the ground. Involuntarily, I &s;prung forward to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, but Lord Merton, to whom &s;he did not belong, &s;topped me, calling out <Q REND="inline">"No foul play! no foul play!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Coverley, then, repeating the &s;ame words, went him&s;elf to help her, and in&s;i&s;ted that the other &s;hould &s;top. A debate en&s;ued; but the poor creature was too much hurt to move, and declared her utter inability to make another at|tempt. Mr. Coverley was quite brutal; he &s;wore
<PB N="150" REF="149">
at her with unmanly rage, and &s;eemed &s;carce able to refrain even from &s;triking her.</P>
<P>Lord Merton then, in great rapture, &s;aid it was a <HI>hollow thing;</HI> but Mr. Coverley contended that the fall was accidental, and time &s;hould be allow|ed for the woman to recover. However, all the company being again&s;t him, he was pronounced the lo&s;er.</P>
<P>We then went to the drawing-room, to tea. After which, the evening being delightful, we all walked in the garden. Lord Merton was quite riotous, and Lady Loui&s;a in high &s;pirits; but Mr. Coverley endeavoured in vain to conceal his cha|grin.</P>
<P>As Lord Orville was thoughtful, and walked by him&s;elf, I expected that, as u&s;ual, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s unnoticed, and be left to my own medita|tions; but this was not the ca&s;e, for Lord Mer|ton, entirely off his guard, giddy equally from wine and &s;ucce&s;s, was very trouble&s;ome to me; and, regardle&s;s of the pre&s;ence of Lady Loui&s;a, which, hitherto, has re&s;trained him even from common civility, he attached him&s;elf to me, du|ring the walk, with a freedom of gallantry that put me extremely out of countenance. He paid me the mo&s;t high-flown compliments, and fre|quently and forcibly &s;eized my hand, though I repeatedly, and with undi&s;&s;embled anger, drew it back. Lord Orville, I &s;aw, watched us with earne&s;tne&s;s, and Lady Loui&s;a's &s;miles were con|verted into looks of di&s;dain.</P>
<P>I could not bear to be thus &s;ituated, and com|plaining I was tired, I quickened my pace, with intention to return to the hou&s;e; but Lord Mer|ton ha&s;tily following, caught my hand, and &s;ay|ing the <HI>day was his own,</HI> vowed he would not let me go.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="150">
<Q REND="inline">"You <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> my Lord,"</Q> cried I, extremely flurried.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are the mo&s;t charming girl in the world,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and never looked better than at this moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, advancing to us, <Q REND="inline">"you don't con&s;ider, that the better Mi&s;s Anville looks, the more &s;triking is the contra&s;t with your Lord&s;hip; therefore, for your own &s;ake, I would advi&s;e you not to hold her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad, my Lord,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"I don't &s;ee what right you have to the be&s;t <HI>old,</HI> and the be&s;t <HI>young</HI> woman too, in the &s;ame day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Be&s;t young woman!</HI>"</Q> repeated Mr. Lovel; <Q REND="inline">"'pon honour, Jack, you have made a mo&s;t unfortunate &s;peech; however, if Lady Loui&s;a can pardon you,&mdash;and her Lady&s;hip is all good|ne&s;s,&mdash;I am &s;ure nobody el&s;e can, for you have committed an outrageous &s;oleci&s;m in good man|ners."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"un|der what denomination may your own &s;peech pa&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Lovel, turning another way, affected not to hear her: and Mr. Coverley, bowing to Lady Loui&s;a, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Her Lady&s;hip is well acquainted with my devotion,&mdash;but egad, I don't know how it is,&mdash;I had always an unlucky turn at an epigram, and never could re&s;i&s;t a &s;mart play upon words in my life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"let go my hand! pray, Mrs. Selwyn, &s;peak for me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"in detain|ing Mi&s;s Anville any longer, you only lo&s;e time, for we are already as well convinced of your va|lour
<PB N="152" REF="151">
and your &s;trength as if you were to hold her an age."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t beg leave to interfere; I know not if Lady Lou|i&s;a can pardon you, but, as this young Lady is at my hou&s;e, I do not chu&s;e to have her made unea&s;y."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> pardon him!"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"I declare I am mon&s;trous glad to get rid of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad, my Lord,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"while you are gra&s;ping at a &s;hadow, you'll lo&s;e a &s;ub&s;tance; you'd be&s;t make your peace while you can."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mr. Coverley, be quiet,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, peevi&s;hly, <Q REND="inline">"for I declare I won't &s;peak to him. Brother,"</Q> (taking hold of Lord Orville's arm) <Q REND="inline">"will you walk in with me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> cried I, frightened to &s;ee how much Lord Merton was in liquor, <Q REND="inline">"that I, too, had a brother!&mdash;and then I &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to &s;uch treatment!"</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville, in&s;tantly quitting Lady Loui&s;a, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Will Mi&s;s Anville allow <HI>me</HI> the honour of taking that title?"</Q> and then, without waiting for any an&s;wer, he di&s;engaged me from Lord Merton, and, handing me to Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"Let me,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"take equal care of <HI>both</HI> my &s;i&s;ters;"</Q> and then, de&s;iring her to take hold of one arm, and begging me to make u&s;e of the other, we reached the hou&s;e in a moment. Lord Mer|ton, di&s;ordered as he was, attempted not to &s;top us.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we entered the hou&s;e, I withdrew my arm, and court&s;ied my thanks, for my heart was too full for &s;peech. Lady Loui&s;a, evidently hurt at her brother's conde&s;cen&s;ion, and piqued extremely by Lord Merton's behaviour, &s;ilent|ly
<PB N="153" REF="152">
drew away her's, and biting her lips, with a look of infinite vexation, walked &s;ullenly up the hall.</P>
<P>Lord Orville a&s;ked her if &s;he would not go into the parlour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, haughtily; <Q REND="inline">"I leave you and your new &s;i&s;ter together,"</Q> and then &s;he walked up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I was quite confounded at the pride and rude|ne&s;s of this &s;peech. Lord Orville him&s;elf &s;eemed thunder&s;truck; I turned from him, and went into the parlour; he followed me, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t I, now, apologi&s;e to Mi&s;s Anville for the liberty of my interference?&mdash;or ought I to apologi&s;e that I did not, as I wi&s;hed, interfere &s;ooner?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O my Lord,"</Q> cried I, with an emotion I could not repre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"it is from you alone I meet with any re&s;pect,&mdash;all others treat me with imper|tinence or contempt!"</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;orry I had not more command of my&s;elf, as he had rea&s;on, ju&s;t then, to &s;uppo&s;e I particu|larly meant his &s;i&s;ter, which, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t very much hurt him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s and merit can fail to excite the love and admiration &s;o ju&s;tly their due! I cannot,&mdash;I dare not expre&s;s to you half the indignation I feel at this moment!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, more calmly, <Q REND="inline">"to have rai&s;ed it; but yet,&mdash;in a &s;ituation that calls for protection, to meet only with mortifi|cations,&mdash;indeed I am but ill formed to bear them!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My <HI>dear</HI> Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> cried he, warmly, <Q REND="inline">"allow <HI>me</HI> to be your friend; think of me as if I were indeed your brother, and let me entreat you to accept my be&s;t &s;ervices, if there is any thing in
<PB N="154" REF="153">
which I can be &s;o happy as to &s;hew my regard,&mdash;my re&s;pect for you!"</Q></P>
<P>Before I had time to &s;peak, the re&s;t of the party entered the parlour, and, as I did not wi&s;h to &s;ee any thing more of Lord Merton, at lea&s;t before he had &s;lept, I determined to leave it. Lord Orville, &s;eeing my de&s;ign, &s;aid, as I pa&s;&s;ed him, <Q REND="inline">"Will you go?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Had not I be&s;t, my Lord?"</Q> &s;aid I. <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid,"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince I mu&s;t now &s;peak as your <HI>brother,</HI> I am afraid you <HI>had;</HI>&mdash;you &s;ee you may tru&s;t me, &s;ince I can advi&s;e again&s;t my own intere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>I then left the room, and have been writing ever &s;ince. And methinks I can never lament the rudene&s;s of Lord Merton, as it has more than ever confirmed to me the e&s;teem of Lord Orville.</P>

<P>OH Sir, what a &s;trange incident have I to re|cite! what a field of conjecture to open!</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening, we all went to an a&s;&s;embly. Lord Orville pre&s;ented tickets to the whole fami|ly, and did me the honour, to the no &s;mall &s;ur|pri&s;e of all here, I believe, to dance with me. But every day abounds in fre&s;h in&s;tances of his conde&s;cending politene&s;s, and he now takes every opportunity of calling me his <HI>friend,</HI> and his <HI>&s;i&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="154">
Lord Merton offered a ticket to Lady Loui&s;a; but &s;he was &s;o much incen&s;ed again&s;t him, that &s;he refu&s;ed it with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain; neither could he prevail upon her to dance with him; &s;he &s;at &s;till the whole evening, and deigned not to look at, or &s;peak to him. To me, her behaviour is almo&s;t the &s;ame, for &s;he is cold, di&s;tant, and haughty, and her eyes expre&s;s the greate&s;t con|tempt. But for Lord Orville, how mi&s;erable would my re&s;idence here make me!</P>
<P>We were joined, in the ball-room, by Mr. Co|verley, Mr. Lovel, and Lord Merton, who look|ed as if he was doing penance, and &s;at all the evening next to Lady Loui&s;a, vainly endeavouring to appea&s;e her anger.</P>
<P>Lord Orville began the minuets; he danced with a young Lady who &s;eemed to engage the ge|neral attention, as &s;he had not been &s;een here before. She is pretty, and looks mild and good|humoured.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mr. Lovel,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"who is that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Belmont,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"the young heire&s;s; &s;he came to the Wells ye&s;terday."</Q></P>
<P>Struck with the name, I involuntarily repeated it, but nobody heard me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is her family?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beau|mont.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you not heard of her, Ma'am?"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he is only daughter and heire&s;s of Sir John Belmont."</Q></P>
<P>Good Heaven, how did I &s;tart! the name &s;truck my ear like a thunder-bolt. Mrs. Sel|wyn, who immediately looked at me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Be calm, my dear, and we will learn the truth of all this."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="155">
Till then, I had never imagined her to be ac|quainted with my &s;tory; but &s;he has &s;ince told me, that &s;he knew my unhappy mother, and was well informed of the whole affair.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked Mr. Lovel a multitude of que&s;tions, and I gathered from his an&s;wers, that this young Lady was ju&s;t come from abroad, with Sir John Belmont, who was now in London; that &s;he was under the care of his &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Pater&s;on; and that &s;he would inherit a con&s;iderable e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s the &s;trange feelings with which I was agitated during this recital. What, my dear|e&s;t Sir, can it po&s;&s;ibly mean? Did you ever hear of any after-marriage?&mdash;or mu&s;t I &s;uppo&s;e, that, while the lawful child is rejected, another is adopt|ed?&mdash;I know not what to think! I am bewildered with a contrariety of ideas!</P>
<P>When we came home, Mrs. Selwyn pa&s;&s;ed more than an hour in my room, conver&s;ing upon this &s;ubject. She &s;ays that I ought in&s;tantly to go to town, find out my father, and have the affair cleared up. She a&s;&s;ures me I have too &s;trong a re&s;emblance to my dear, though unknown mother, to allow of the lea&s;t he&s;itation in my being owned, when once I am &s;een. For my part, I have no wi&s;h but to act by your direction.</P>
<P>I can give no account of the evening; &s;o di&s;|turbed, &s;o occupied am I by this &s;ubject, that I can think of no other. I have entreated Mrs. Sel|wyn to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecrecy, and &s;he has promi&s;ed that &s;he will. Indeed, &s;he has too much &s;en&s;e to be idly communicative.</P>
<P>Lord Orville took notice of my being ab&s;ent and &s;ilent, but I ventured not to entru&s;t him with the cau&s;e. Fortunately, he was not of the party at the time Mr. Lovel made the di&s;covery.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="156">
Mrs. Selwyn &s;ays that if you approve my going to town, &s;he will her&s;elf accompany me. I had a thou&s;and times rather a&s;k the protection of Mrs. Mirvan, but, after this offer, that will not be po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Sir. I am &s;ure you will write immediately, and I &s;hall be all impatience till your letter arrives.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>GOOD God, my dear Sir, what a wonderful tale have I again to relate! even yet, I am not recovered from my extreme &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning, as &s;oon as I had fini&s;hed my ha&s;ty letter, I was &s;ummoned to attend a walk|ing party to the Hotwells. It con&s;i&s;ted only of Mrs. Selwyn and Lord Orville. The latter walk|ed by my &s;ide all the way, and his conver&s;ation di&s;&s;ipated my unea&s;ine&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibly re&s;tored my &s;erenity.</P>
<P>At the pump-room, I &s;aw Mr. Macartney; I court&s;ied to him twice ere he would &s;peak to me. When he did, I began to apologi&s;e for having di&s;|appointed him; but I did not find it very ea&s;y to excu&s;e my&s;elf, as Lord Orville's eyes, with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of anxiety that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, turned from him to me, and me to him, every word I &s;poke. Convinced, however, that I had really trifled with
<PB N="158" REF="157">
Mr. Macartney, I &s;crupled not to beg his pardon. He was, then, not merely appea&s;ed, but even grateful.</P>
<P>He reque&s;ted me to &s;ee him to-morrow: but I had not the folly to be again guilty of an indi&s;|cretion which had, already, cau&s;ed me &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s; and therefore, I told him, frankly, that it was not in my power, at pre&s;ent, to &s;ee him, but by accident: and, to prevent his being offended, I hinted to him the rea&s;on I could not receive him as I wi&s;hed to do.</P>
<P>When I had &s;atisfied both him and my&s;elf upon this &s;ubject, I turned to Lord Orville, and &s;aw, with concern, the gravity of his countenance. I would have &s;poken to him, but knew not how; I believe, however, he read my thoughts, for in a little time, with a &s;ort of &s;erious &s;mile, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Does not Mr. Macartney complain of his di&s;|appointment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not much, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how have you appea&s;ed him?"</Q> Finding I he&s;itated what to an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">"Am I not your brother?"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"and mu&s;t I not enquire into your affairs?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"I only wi&s;h it were better worth your Lord|&s;hip's while."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let me, then, make immediate u&s;e of my privilege. When &s;hall you &s;ee Mr. Macartney again?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, I can't tell."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But,&mdash;do you know that I &s;hall not &s;uffer <HI>my &s;i&s;ter</HI> to make a private appointment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, earne&s;tly, <Q REND="inline">"u&s;e that word no more! indeed you &s;hock me extre|mely."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="158">
<Q REND="inline">"That would I not do for the world,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"yet you know not how warmly, how deeply I am intere&s;ted, not only in all your concerns, but in all your actions."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech,&mdash;the mo&s;t particular one Lord Orville had ever made to me, ended our conver|&s;ation for that time, for I was too much &s;truck by it to make any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Soon after, Mr. Macartney, in a low voice, entreated me not to deny him the gratificati|on of returning the money. While he was &s;peaking, the young Lady I &s;aw ye&s;terday at the a&s;&s;embly, with a large party, entered the pump-room. Mr. Macartney turned as pale as death, his voice faltered, and he &s;eemed not to know what he &s;aid. I was my&s;elf almo&s;t equally di&s;turbed, by the croud of confu&s;ed ideas that occured to me. Good Heaven, thought I, why &s;hould he be thus agi|tated?&mdash;is it po&s;&s;ible this can be the young Lady he loved?</P>
<P>In a few minutes, we quitted the pump|room, and though I twice wi&s;hed Mr. Macartney good morning, he was &s;o ab&s;ent he did not hear me.</P>
<P>We did not immediately return to Clifton, as Mrs. Selwyn had bu&s;ine&s;s at a pamphlet-&s;hop. While &s;he was looking at &s;ome new poems, Lord Orville again a&s;ked me when I &s;hould &s;ee Mr. Macartney?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"I know not; but I would give the univer&s;e for a few moments conver&s;ation with him!"</Q> I &s;poke this with a &s;im|ple &s;incerity, and was not aware of the force of my own words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The univer&s;e!"</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, Mi&s;s Anville, do you &s;ay this to <HI>me?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="159">
<Q REND="inline">"I would &s;ay it,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline">"to any body, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</Q> &s;aid he, in a voice that &s;hewed him ill plea&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"I am an&s;wered!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried, I, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t not judge hardly of me. I &s;poke inadvertently; but if you knew the painful &s;u&s;pence I &s;uffer at this moment, you would not be &s;urpri&s;ed at what I have &s;aid."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And would a meeting with Mr. Macartney relieve you from that &s;u&s;pence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord, two words might be &s;uffici|ent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> cried he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"that I were worthy to know their im|port!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Worthy, my Lord!&mdash;O, if that were all, your Lord&s;hip could a&s;k nothing I &s;hould not be ready to an&s;wer! if I were but at liberty to &s;peak, I &s;hould be <HI>proud</HI> of your Lord&s;hip's enquiries; but indeed I am not, I have no right to commu|nicate the affairs of Mr. Macartney,&mdash;your Lord|&s;hip cannot &s;uppo&s;e I have."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will own to you,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"I know not <HI>what</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e; yet there &s;eems a frankne&s;s even in your my&s;tery,&mdash;and &s;uch an air of open|ne&s;s in your countenance, that I am willing to hope,&mdash;"</Q> He &s;topped a moment, and then added, <Q REND="inline">"This meeting you &s;ay, is e&s;&s;ential to your re|po&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I did not &s;ay <HI>that,</HI> my Lord; but yet I have the mo&s;t important rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to &s;peak to him."</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a few minutes, and then &s;aid, with warmth, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, you <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;peak to him!&mdash;I will my&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;t you!&mdash;Mi&s;s Anville, I am &s;ure can|not form a wi&s;h again&s;t propriety, I will a&s;k no que&s;tions, I will rely upon her own purity; and
<PB N="161" REF="160">
uninformed, blindfold as I am, I will &s;erve her with all my power!"</Q> and then he went into the &s;hop, leaving me &s;o &s;trangely affected by his ge|nerous behaviour, that I almo&s;t wi&s;hed to follow him with my thanks.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Selwyn had tran&s;acted her affairs, we returned home.</P>
<P>The moment dinner was over, Lord Orville went out, and did not come back till ju&s;t as we were &s;ummoned to &s;upper. This is the longe&s;t time he has &s;pent from the hou&s;e &s;ince I have been at Clifton, and you cannot imagine, my dear Sir, how much I mi&s;&s;ed him. I &s;carce knew before how infinitely I am indebted to him alone for the happine&s;s I have enjoyed &s;ince I have been at Mrs. Beaumont's.</P>
<P>As I generally go down &s;tairs la&s;t, he came to me the moment the ladies had pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Shall you be at home to-morrow morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe &s;o, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And will you, then, receive a vi&s;itor for me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For you, my Lord!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes;&mdash;I have made acquaintance with Mr. Macartney, and he has promi&s;ed to call upon me to-morrow about three o'clock."</Q></P>
<P>And then, taking my hand, he led me down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>O Sir,&mdash;was there ever &s;uch another man as Lord Orville?&mdash;Yes, <HI>one</HI> other now re&s;ides at Berry-Hill!</P>
<P>This morning there has been a great deal of company here, but at the time appointed by Lord Orville, doubtle&s;s with that con&s;ideration, the parlour is almo&s;t always empty, as every body is dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="161">
Mrs. Beaumont, however, was not gone up &s;tairs, when Mr. Macartney &s;ent in his name.</P>
<P>Lord Orville immediately &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Beg the fa|vour of him to walk in. You &s;ee, Madam, that I con&s;ider my&s;elf as at home.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"or I &s;hould be very unea&s;y."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Macartney then entered. I believe we both felt very con&s;cious to whom the vi&s;it was paid: but Lord Orville received him as his own gue&s;t, and not merely entertained him as &s;uch while Mrs. Beaumont remained in the room, but for &s;ome time after &s;he went; a delicacy that &s;av|ed me from the embarra&s;&s;ment I &s;hould have felt, had he immediately quitted us.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, however, he gave Mr. Ma|cartney a book,&mdash;for I, too, by way of pretence for continuing in the room, pretended to be read|ing,&mdash;and begged he would be &s;o good as to look it over, while he an&s;wered a note, which he would di&s;patch in a few minutes, and return to him.</P>
<P>When he was gone, we both parted with our books, and Mr. Macartney, again producing the paper with the money, be&s;ought me to accept it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray,</Q> "&s;aid I, &s;till declining it, <Q REND="inline">"did you know the young lady who came into the pump|room ye&s;terday morning?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Know her!"</Q> repeated he, changing colour, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, but too well!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Why, Madam, do you a&s;k?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t be&s;eech you to &s;atisfy me further upon this &s;ubject; pray tell me who &s;he is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Inviolably as I meant to keep my &s;ecret, I can refu&s;e you, Madam, nothing;&mdash;that lady
<PB N="163" REF="162">
&mdash;is the daughter of Sir John Belmont!&mdash;of my father!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Gracious Heaven!"</Q> cried I, involuntarily laying my hand on his arm, <Q REND="inline">"you are then&mdash;",</Q> <HI>my brother,</HI> I would have &s;aid, but my voice fail|ed me, and I bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, Madam,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"what can this mean?&mdash;What can thus di&s;tre&s;s you?"</Q></P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer him, but held out my hand to him. He &s;eemed greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, and talked in high terms of my conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Spare your&s;elf,"</Q> cried I, wiping my eyes, <Q REND="inline">"&s;pare your&s;elf this mi&s;take,&mdash;you have a <HI>right</HI> to all I can do for you; the &s;imilarity of our cir|cum&s;tances&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>We were then interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Selwyn; and Mr. Macartney, finding no probability of our being left alone, was obliged to take leave, tho', I believe, very reluctantly, while in &s;uch &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn then, by dint of interrogatories, drew from me the &s;tate of this affair. She is &s;o penetrating, that there is no po&s;&s;ibility of evading to give her &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Is not this a &s;trange event? Good Heaven, how little did I think that the vi&s;its I &s;o unwilling|ly paid at Mr. Branghton's would have introduc|ed me to &s;o near a relation! I will never again re|gret the time I &s;pent in town this &s;ummer: a cir|cum&s;tance &s;o fortunate will always make me think of it with plea&s;ure.</P>

<P><HI>His &s;ight is baneful to my repo&s;e,&mdash;his &s;ociety is death to my future tranquility!</HI> Oh, Lord Or|ville! could I have believed that a friend&s;hip &s;o grateful to my heart,&mdash;&s;o &s;oothing to my di&s;|tre&s;&s;es,&mdash;a friend&s;hip which, in every re&s;pect, did me &s;o much honour, would only &s;erve to embitter all my future moments!&mdash;What a &s;trange, what an unhappy circum&s;tance, that my gratitude, though &s;o ju&s;tly excited, &s;hould be &s;o fatal to my peace!</P>

<P>You, Sir, relied upon my ignorance;&mdash;I, alas, upon your experience; and, whenever I doubted the weakne&s;s of my heart, the idea that <HI>you</HI> did not &s;u&s;pect it, rea&s;&s;ured me,&mdash;re&s;|&s;tored my courage, and confirmed my error!&mdash;Yet am I mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the kindne&s;s of your &s;ilence?</P>

<P>I HAVE only time, my deare&s;t Sir, for three words, to overtake my la&s;t letter, and prevent your expecting me immediately; for, when I communicated my intention to Mrs. Sel|wyn, &s;he would not hear of it, and declared, it would be highly ridiculous for me to go be|fore I received an an&s;wer to my intelligence, concerning the journey from Paris. She has, therefore, in&s;i&s;ted upon my waiting till your next letter arrives. I hope you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed at my compliance, though it is rather again&s;t my own judgment; but Mrs. Selwyn quite overpowered me with the force of her argu|ments. I will, however, &s;ee very little of Lord Orville; I will never come down &s;tairs before breakfa&s;t; give up all my walks in the garden,&mdash;&s;eat my&s;elf next to Mrs. Selwyn, and not merely avoid his conver&s;ation, but &s;hun his pre&s;ence. I will exert all the prudence, and all the re&s;olution in my power,&mdash;to prevent this &s;hort delay from giving you any further unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>October 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY, from the time I received your kind, though heart-piercing letter, I kept my room,&mdash;for I was equally unable and unwilling to &s;ee Lord Orville: but this morning, finding I &s;eemed de&s;tined to pa&s;s a few days longer here, I endeavoured to calm my &s;pirits, and to appear as u&s;ual; though I determined to avoid him as much as &s;hould be in my power. Indeed, as I entered the parlour, when called to breakfa&s;t, my thoughts were &s;o much occupied with your letter, that I felt as much confu&s;ion at his &s;ight, as if he had him&s;elf been informed of its con|tents.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont made me a &s;light compliment upon my recovery, for I had pleaded illne&s;s to excu&s;e keeping my room: Lady Loui&s;a &s;poke not a word: but Lord Orville, little imagining him&s;elf the cau&s;e of my indi&s;po&s;ition, enquired concerning my health with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ing politene&s;s. I hardly made any an&s;wer, and, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince I have been here, contriv|ed to &s;it at &s;ome di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P>I could not help ob&s;erving that my re&s;erve &s;urpri&s;ed him; yet he per&s;i&s;ted in his civilities, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h to remove it. But I paid him but very little attention; and the moment breakfa&s;t was over, in&s;tead of taking a book, or walking in the garden, I retired to my own room.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167">
Soon after, Mrs. Selwyn came to tell me that Lord Orville had been propo&s;ing I &s;hould take an airing, and per&s;uading her to let him drive us both in his phaeton. She delivered the me&s;|&s;age with an archne&s;s that made me blu&s;h, and added, that an airing, in <HI>my Lord Orville's car|riage,</HI> could not fail to revive my &s;pirits. There is no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping her di&s;cernment; &s;he has frequently rallied me upon his Lord&s;hip's at|tention,&mdash;and, alas!&mdash;upon the plea&s;ure with which I have received it! However, I ab&s;olute|ly refu&s;ed the offer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot ju&s;t now indulge you with any &s;olicitation; for, to tell you the truth, I have bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act at the Wells, and am glad to be excu&s;ed my&s;elf. I would a&s;k you to walk with <HI>me,</HI>&mdash;but, &s;ince <HI>Lord Orville</HI> is refu&s;ed, <HI>I</HI> have not the pre&s;umption to hope for &s;ucce&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"you are mi&s;taken; I will attend <HI>you</HI> with plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O rare coquetry!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely it mu&s;t be inherent in our &s;ex, or it could not have been imbibed at Berry Hill."</Q></P>
<P>I had not &s;pirits to an&s;wer her, and therefore put on my hat and cloak in &s;ilence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I pre&s;ume,"</Q> continued &s;he, drily, <Q REND="inline">"his Lord&s;hip may walk with us?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If &s;o, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"you will have a companion, and I will &s;tay at home."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear child,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"did you bring the certificate of your birth with you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dear Madam, no!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, we &s;hall never be known again at Berry Hill."</Q></P>
<P>I felt too con&s;cious to enjoy her plea&s;antry; but I believe &s;he was determined to torment me;
<PB N="169" REF="168">
for &s;he a&s;ked if &s;he &s;hould inform Lord Orville that I de&s;ired him not to be of the party?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means, Madam;&mdash;but, indeed, I had rather not walk my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I really do not know you this morning,&mdash;you have certainly been taking a le&s;&s;on of Lady Loui&s;a."</Q></P>
<P>She then went down &s;tairs; but pre&s;ently re|turning, told me &s;he had acquainted Lord Orville that I did not choo&s;e to go out in the phaeton, but preferred a walk, <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> with her, by way of <HI>variety.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aid nothing, but was really vexed. She bid me go down &s;tairs, and &s;aid &s;he would follow im|mediately.</P>
<P>Lord Orville met me in the hall. <Q REND="inline">"I fear,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Anville is not yet quite well?"</Q> and he would have taken my hand, but I turned from him, and court&s;ying &s;lightly, went into the parlour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont and Lady Loui&s;a were at work: Lord Merton was talking with the latter; for he has now made his peace, and been again received into favour.</P>
<P>I &s;eated my&s;elf, as u&s;ual, by the window. Lord Orville, in a few minutes, came to me, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why is Mi&s;s Anville &s;o grave?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not grave, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"only &s;tu|pid;"</Q> and I took up a book.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will go,"</Q> &s;aid he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"to the a&s;&s;embly to-night?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord, certainly not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neither, then, will I; for I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ully the remembrance I have of the happine&s;s I enjoyed at the la&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn then coming in, general enquiries were made, to all but me, of who would go to
<PB N="170" REF="169">
the a&s;&s;embly. Lord Orville in&s;tantly declared he had letters to write at home; but every one el&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ettled to go.</P>
<P>I then ha&s;tened Mrs. Selwyn away, tho' not be|fore &s;he had &s;aid to Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"Pray has your Lord&s;hip obtained Mi&s;s Anville's leave to favour us with your company?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have not, Madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"had the vanity to a&s;k it."</Q></P>
<P>During our walk, Mrs. Selwyn tormented me unmercifully. She told me, that &s;ince I declined any addition to our party, I mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, be con&s;cious of my own powers of entertainment; and begged me, therefore, to exert them freely. I repented a thou&s;and times having con&s;ented to walk alone with her; for though I made the mo&s;t painful efforts to appear in &s;pirits, her raillery quite overpowered me.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place we went to was the pump-room. It was full of company; and the moment we en|tered, I heard a murmuring of, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That's &s;he!</HI>"</Q> and, to my great confu&s;ion, I &s;aw every eye turn|ed towards me. I pulled my hat over my face, and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mrs. Selwyn, endeavour|ed to &s;creen my&s;elf from ob&s;ervation: neverthe|le&s;s, I found I was &s;o much the object of general attention, that I entreated her to ha&s;ten away. But, unfortunately, &s;he had entered into conver|&s;ation, very earne&s;tly, with a gentleman of her acquaintance, and would not li&s;ten to me, but &s;aid, that if I was tired of waiting, I might walk on to the milliner's with the Mi&s;s Watkins, two young ladies I had &s;een at Mrs. Beaumont's who were going thither.</P>
<P>I accepted the offer very readily, and away we went. But we had not gone three yards, ere we were followed by a party of young men, who
<PB N="171" REF="170">
took every po&s;&s;ible opportunity of looking at us, and, as they walked behind, talked aloud, in a manner at once unintelligible and ab&s;urd. <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> cried one, <Q REND="inline">"'tis certainly &s;he!"</Q>&mdash;mark but her <HI>blu&s;hing cheek!</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And then her <HI>eye,</HI>&mdash;her <HI>downca&s;t eye!</HI>"</Q> cried another.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True, oh mo&s;t true,"</Q> &s;aid a third, <Q REND="inline"><HI>every beauty is her own!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But then,"</Q> &s;aid the fir&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"her <HI>mind,</HI>&mdash;now the difficulty is, to find out the truth of <HI>that,</HI>&mdash;for &s;he will not &s;ay a word."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She is <HI>timid,</HI>"</Q> an&s;wered another; <Q REND="inline">"mark but her <HI>timid air.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation, we all walked on, &s;i|lent and quick; as we knew not to whom it was particularly addre&s;&s;ed, we were all equally a&s;ham|ed, and equally de&s;irous to avoid &s;uch unaccoun|table ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Soon after, we were caught in a violent &s;hower of rain. We hurried on, and the care of our cloaths occupying our hands, we were &s;eparated from one another. The&s;e gentlemen offered their &s;ervices in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, begging us to make u&s;e of their arms; and two of them were &s;o particularly trouble&s;ome to me, that, in my ha&s;te to avoid them, I unfortunately &s;tumbled, and fell down. They both a&s;&s;i&s;ted in helping me up; and that very in&s;tant, while I was yet between them, upon rai&s;ing my eyes, the fir&s;t object they met was Sir Clement Willough|by!</P>
<P>He &s;tarted; &s;o, I am &s;ure, did I. <Q REND="inline">"Good God!"</Q> exclaimed he, with his u&s;ual quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Anville!&mdash;I hope to Heaven you are not hurt?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="171">
<Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"not at all; but I am ter|ribly dirtied."</Q> I then, without much difficulty, di&s;engaged my&s;elf from my tormentors, who im|mediately gave way to Sir Clement, and entirely quitted us.</P>
<P>He teized me to make u&s;e of his arm; and, when I declined it, a&s;ked, very &s;ignificantly, if I was much acquainted with tho&s;e gentlemen who had ju&s;t left me?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"they are quite un|known to me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And yet,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you allowed <HI>them</HI> the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting you. Oh, Mi&s;s Anville, to me alone will you ever be thus cruel?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir Clement, their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was <HI>forced</HI> upon me, for I would have given the world to have avoided them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"why did I not &s;ooner know your &s;ituation?&mdash;But I only arrived here this morning, and I had not even learnt where you lodged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you know, then, that I was at Bri&s;|tol?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"that I <HI>could</HI> remain in ignorance of your proceedings with the &s;ame contentment you do of mine! then &s;hould I not for ever journey upon the wings of hope, to meet my own de&s;pair! <HI>You</HI> cannot even judge of the cruelty of my fate, for the ea&s;e and &s;erenity of your mind, incapacitates you from feel|ing for the agitation of mine."</Q></P>
<P>The ea&s;e and &s;erenity of <HI>my</HI> mind! alas, how little do I merit tho&s;e words!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But;"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"had <HI>accident</HI> brought me hither, had I not known of your journey, the voice of fame would have proclaimed it to me in|&s;tantly upon my arrival."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The voice of fame!"</Q> repeated I.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="172">
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, for your's was the fir&s;t name I heard at the pump-room. But, had I <HI>not</HI> heard your name, &s;uch a de&s;cription could have painted no one el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"I do not under&s;tand you."</Q> But, ju&s;t then arriving at the milliner's, our con|ver&s;ation ended; for I ran up &s;tairs to wipe the dirt off my gown. I &s;hould have been glad to have remained there till Mrs. Selwyn came, but the Mi&s;s Watkins called me into the &s;hop, to look at caps and ribbons.</P>
<P>I found Sir Clement bu&s;ily engaged in looking at lace ruffles. In&s;tantly, however, approaching me, <Q REND="inline">"How charmed I am,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ee you look &s;o well! I was told you were ill,&mdash;but I never &s;aw you in better health,&mdash;never more infi|nitely lovely!"</Q></P>
<P>I turned away to examine the ribbons, and &s;oon after Mrs. Selwyn made her appearance. I found that &s;he was acquainted with Sir Clement, and her manner of &s;peaking to him, convinced me that he was a favourite with her.</P>
<P>When their mutual compliments were over, &s;he turned to me, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mi&s;s An|ville, how long can you live without nouri&s;h|ment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid I, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"I have never tried."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, what is the matter, Ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The matter!&mdash;why, all the ladies are at open war with you,&mdash;the whole pump-room is in con|fu&s;ion; and you, innocent as you pretend to look, are the cau&s;e. However if you take my advice, you will be very careful how you eat and drink during your &s;tay."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="173">
I begged her to explain her&s;elf: and &s;he then told me, that a copy of ver&s;es had been dropt in the pump-room, and read there aloud: <Q REND="inline">"The beauties of the well,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"are all menti|oned, but <HI>you</HI> are the Venus to whom the prize is given."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it then po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"that you have not &s;een the&s;e ver&s;es?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hardly know,"</Q> an&s;wered I, <Q REND="inline">"whether <HI>any</HI> body has."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"if you give <HI>me</HI> the invention of them, you do me an ho|nour I by no means de&s;erve."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wrote down in my tablets,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Cle|ment, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;tanzas which concern Mi&s;s Anville, this morning at the pump-room; and I will do my&s;elf the honour of copying them for her this evening."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But why the part that concerned <HI>Mi&s;s Anvil|le?</HI>"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn; <Q REND="inline">"Did you ever &s;ee her before this morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh yes,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"I have had that happine&s;s frequently at Captain Mirvan's.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I have a thou&s;and things,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ay to you. Pray where are you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With Mrs. Selwyn, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed!&mdash;then, for once, Chance is my friend. And how long have you been here?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"About three weeks."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven! what an anxious &s;earch have I had, to di&s;cover your abode, &s;ince you &s;o &s;ud|denly
<PB N="175" REF="174">

<P>Mrs. Selwyn then advancing to us, he a&s;&s;umed a more di&s;engaged air, and a&s;ked if he &s;hould not have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, in the evening, at the a&s;&s;embly?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh yes,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"we &s;hall certainly be there; &s;o you may bring the ver&s;es with you, if Mi&s;s Anville can wait for them &s;o long."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, then,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"that you will do me the honour to dance with me?"</Q></P>
<P>I thanked him, but &s;aid I &s;hould not be at the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not be at the a&s;&s;embly!"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"Why, have <HI>you,</HI> too, letters to write?"</Q></P>
<P>She looked at me with a &s;ignificant archne&s;s that made me colour; and I ha&s;tily an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, Ma'am!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have not!"</Q> cried &s;he, yet more drily, <Q REND="inline">"then pray, my dear, do you &s;tay at home to <HI>help,</HI>&mdash;or to <HI>hinder</HI> others?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="175">
<Q REND="inline">"To do neither, Ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered I, in much confu&s;ion; <Q REND="inline">"&s;o, if you plea&s;e, I will <HI>not</HI> &s;tay at home."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You allow me, then,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"to hope for the honour of your hand?"</Q></P>
<P>I only bowed,&mdash;for the dread of Mrs. Selwyn's raillery made me not dare to refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>Soon after this, we walked home; Sir Cle|ment accompanied us, and the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between Mrs. Selwyn and him was &s;up|ported in &s;o lively a manner, that I &s;hould have been much entertained, had my mind been more at ea&s;e: but alas! I could think of nothing but the capricious, the unmeaning appearance which the alteration in my conduct mu&s;t make in the eyes of Lord Orville! And, much as I wi&s;h to avoid him, greatly as I de&s;ire to &s;ave my&s;elf from having my weakne&s;s known to him,&mdash;yet I can|not endure to incur his ill opinion,&mdash;and, unac|quainted as he is with the rea&s;ons by which I am actuated, how can he fail contemning a change, to him &s;o unaccountable?</P>
<P>As we entered the garden, he was the fir&s;t ob|ject we &s;aw. He advanced to meet us, and I could not help ob&s;erving, that at &s;ight of each other, both he and Sir Clement changed colour.</P>
<P>We went into the parlour, where we found the &s;ame party we had left. Mrs. Selwyn pre&s;ented Sir Clement to Mrs. Beaumont; Lady Loui&s;a and Lord Merton he &s;eemed well acquainted with already.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was upon the general &s;ubjects, of the weather, the company at the Wells, and the news of the day. But Sir Clement, drawing his chair next to mine, took every opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me in particular.</P>
<P>I could not but remark the &s;triking difference of
<PB N="177" REF="176">
<HI>his</HI> attention, and that of Lord Orville: the lat|ter has &s;uch gentlene&s;s of manners, &s;uch delicacy of conduct, and an air &s;o re&s;pectful, that, when he flatters mo&s;t, he never di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and when he mo&s;t confers honour, appears to receive it! The former <HI>obtrudes</HI> his attention, and <HI>forces</HI> mine; it is &s;o pointed, that it always confu&s;es me, and &s;o public, that it attracts general notice. Indeed I have &s;ometimes thought that he would rather <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> than di&s;like to have his partiality for me known, as he takes great care to prevent my be|ing &s;poken to by any body but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When, at length, he went away, Lord Or|ville took his &s;eat, and &s;aid with a half-&s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"Shall <HI>I</HI> call Sir Clement,&mdash;or will <HI>you</HI> call me an u&s;urper, for taking this place?&mdash;You make me no an&s;wer?&mdash;Mu&s;t I then &s;uppo&s;e that Sir Clement&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is little worth your Lord&s;hip's while,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;uppo&s;e any thing upon &s;o in&s;ignificant an occa&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> cried he,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"to <HI>me</HI> nothing is in&s;ignificant in which you are concerned."</Q></P>
<P>To this I made no an&s;wer, neither did he &s;ay any thing more, till the ladies retired to dre&s;s; and then, when I would have followed them, he &s;topped me, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"One moment, I entreat you!"</Q></P>
<P>I turned back, and he went on. <Q REND="inline">"I greatly fear that I have been &s;o unfortunate as to offend you; yet &s;o repugnant to my very &s;oul is the idea, that I know not how to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible I can un|wittingly have done the thing in the world that, de&s;ignedly, I would mo&s;t wi&s;h to avoid."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, my Lord, you have not!"</Q> &s;aid I.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;igh,"</Q> cried he, taking my hand,
<PB N="178" REF="177">
<Q REND="inline">"would to Heaven I were the &s;harer of your un|ea&s;ine&s;s whence&s;oever it &s;prings! with what earn|e&s;tne&s;s would I not &s;truggle to alleviate it!&mdash;Tell me, my dear Mi&s;s Anville,&mdash;my new-adopted &s;i&s;|ter, my &s;weet and mo&s;t amiable friend!&mdash;tell me, I be&s;eech you, if I can afford you any a&s;&s;i&s;tance?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None, none, my Lord!"</Q> cried I, with|drawing my hand, and moving towards the door.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it then impo&s;&s;ible I can &s;erve you?&mdash;per|haps you wi&s;h to &s;ee Mr. Macartney again?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord."</Q> And I held the door open.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am not, I own, &s;orry for that. Yet, oh, Mi&s;s Anville, there <HI>is</HI> a que&s;tion,&mdash;there is a con|jecture,&mdash;I know not how to mention, becau&s;e I dread the re&s;ult!&mdash;But I &s;ee you are in ha&s;te;&mdash;perhaps in the evening I may have the honour of a longer conver&s;ation.&mdash;Yet one thing will you have the goodne&s;s to allow me to a&s;k?&mdash;Did you, this morning when you went to the Wells,&mdash;did you <HI>know</HI> who you &s;hould meet there?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who, my Lord?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon a thon&s;and times for a curio&s;ity &s;o unlicen&s;ed,&mdash;but I will &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P>He bowed, expecting me to go,&mdash;and then, with quick &s;teps, but a heavy heart, I came to my own room. His que&s;tion, I am &s;ure, meant Sir Clement Willoughby; and, had I not impo&s;|ed upon upon my&s;elf the &s;evere ta&s;k of avoiding, flying Lord Orville with all my power, I would in&s;tantly have &s;atisfied him of my ignorance of Sir Clement's journey. And yet more did I long to &s;ay &s;omething of the a&s;&s;embly, &s;ince I found he depended upon my &s;pending the evening at home.</P>
<P>I did not go down &s;tairs again till the family was a&s;&s;embled to dinner. My dre&s;s, I &s;aw, &s;truck Lord Orville with a&s;toni&s;hment; and I was my|&s;elf
<PB N="179" REF="178">
&s;o much a&s;hamed of appearing whim&s;ical and un&s;teady, that I could not look up.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tood,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"that Mi&s;s Anville did not go out this evening?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Her intention in the morning,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">was to &s;tay at home; but there is a fa&s;|cinating power in an <HI>a&s;&s;embly,</HI> which upon &s;econd thoughts, is not to be re&s;i&s;ted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The a&s;&s;embly!"</Q> cried Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"are you then going to the a&s;&s;embly?"</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer; and we all took our places at table.</P>
<P>It was not without difficulty that I contrived to give up my u&s;ual &s;eat; but I was determined to adhere to the promi&s;e in my ye&s;terday's letter, though I &s;aw that Lord Orville &s;eemed quite con|founded at my vi&s;ible endeavours to avoid him.</P>
<P>After dinner, we all went into the drawing|room together, as there were no gentlemen to de|tain his Lord&s;hip; and then, before I could place my&s;elf out of his way, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are then really going to the a&s;&s;embly?&mdash;May I a&s;k if you &s;hall dance?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe not,&mdash;my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I did not fear,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"that you would be tired of the &s;ame partner at two follow|ing a&s;&s;emblies, I would give up my letter-writing till to-morrow, and &s;olicit the honour of your hand."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I <HI>do</HI> dance,"</Q> &s;aid I, in great confu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"I believe I am engaged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Engaged!"</Q> cried he, with earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"May I a&s;k to whom?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To&mdash;Sir Clement Willoughby, my Lord?"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid nothing, but looked very little plea&s;ed, and did not addre&s;s him&s;elf to me any more all the
<PB N="180" REF="179">
afternoon. Oh, Sir!&mdash;thus &s;ituated, how com|fortle&s;s were the feelings of your Evelina!</P>
<P>Early in the evening, with his accu&s;tomed a&s;&s;iduity, Sir Clement came to conduct us to the a&s;&s;embly. He &s;oon contrived to &s;eat him&s;elf next me, and, in a low voice, paid me &s;o many compliments, that I knew not which way to look.</P>
<P>Lord Orville hardly &s;poke a word, and his countenance was grave and thoughtful; yet when|ever I rai&s;ed my eyes, his, I perceived, were di|rected towards me, though in&s;tantly, upon meet|ing mine, he looked another way.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, Sir Clement, taking from his pocket a folded paper, &s;aid, almo&s;t in a whi&s;|per, <Q REND="inline">"Here, lovelie&s;t of women, you will &s;ee a faint, a &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s attempt, to paint the ob|ject of all my adoration! yet, weak as are the lines for the purpo&s;e, I envy beyond expre&s;|&s;ion the happy mortal who has dared make the effort."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will look at them,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome other time."</Q> For, con&s;cious that I was ob&s;erved by Lord Orville, I could not bear he &s;hould &s;ee me take a written paper, &s;o privately offered, from Sir Clement. But Sir Clement is an im|practicable man, and I never yet &s;ucceeded in any attempt to fru&s;trate whatever he had plan|ned.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;till in a whi&s;per, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t take it now, while Lady Loui&s;a is away,"</Q> (for &s;he and Mrs. Selwyn were gone up &s;tairs to fini&s;h their dre&s;s,) <Q REND="inline">"as &s;he mu&s;t by no means &s;ee them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"I have no intention to &s;hew them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="180">
<Q REND="inline">"But the only way,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"to avoid &s;u&s;picion, is to take them in her ab|&s;ence. I would have read them aloud my&s;elf, but that they are not proper to be &s;een by any body in this hou&s;e, your&s;elf and Mrs. Selwyn excepted."</Q></P>
<P>Then again he pre&s;ented me the paper, which I now was obliged to take, as I found declin|ing it was vain. But I was &s;orry that this action &s;hould be &s;een, and the whi&s;pering remarked, though the purport of the conver&s;ation was left to conjecture.</P>
<P>As I held it in my hand, Sir Clement teaz|ed me to look at it immediately; and told me, that the rea&s;on he could not produce the lines publicly, was, that, among the ladies who were mentioned, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be rejected, was Lady Loui&s;a Larpent. I am much concerned at this circum&s;tance, as I cannot doubt but that it will render me more di&s;agreeable to her than ever, if &s;he &s;hould hear of it.</P>
<P>I will now copy the ver&s;es, which Sir Clement would not let me re&s;t till I had read.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>SEE, la&s;t advance, with ba&s;hful grace,</L>
<L>Downca&s;t eye, and blu&s;hing cheek,</L>
<L>Timid air, and beauteous face,</L>

<L>Though ev'ry beauty is her own,</L>
<L>And though her mind each virtue fills,</L>
<L>Anville,&mdash;to her power unknown,</L>
<L>Artle&s;s, &s;trikes,&mdash;uncon&s;cious kills!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I am &s;ure, my dear Sir, you will not won|der that a panegyric &s;uch as this, &s;hould, in
<PB N="182" REF="181">
reading, give me the greate&s;t confu&s;ion; and, un|fortunately, before I had fini&s;hed it, the ladies re|turned</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What have you there, my dear?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid I, ha&s;tily &s;olding, and putting it in my pocket.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And has <HI>nothing,</HI>"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"the power of <HI>rouge?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer; a deep &s;igh which e&s;cap|ed Lord Orville, at that moment, reached my ears, and gave me &s;en&s;ations&mdash;which I dare not mention!</P>
<P>Lord Merton then handed Lady Loui&s;a, and Mrs. Beaumont, to the latter's carriage. Mrs. Selwyn led the way to Sir Clement's, who handed me in after her.</P>
<P>During the ride, I did not once &s;peak; but when I came to the a&s;&s;embly-room, Sir Clement took care that I &s;hould not pre&s;erve my &s;ilence. He a&s;ked me immediately to dance; I begged him to excu&s;e me, and &s;eek &s;ome other partner. But on the contrary, he told me he was very glad I would &s;it &s;till, as he had a million of things to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P>He then began to tell me how much he had &s;uf|fered from ab&s;ence; how greatly he was alarmed when he heard I had left town, and how cruelly difficult he had found it to trace me; which, at la&s;t, he could only do by &s;acrificing another week to Captain Mirvan.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And Howard Grove,"</Q> &s;till continued he, <Q REND="inline">"which, at my fir&s;t vi&s;it, I thought the mo&s;t delightful &s;pot upon earth, now appeared to be the mo&s;t di&s;mal; the face of the country &s;eemed al|tered: the walks, which I had thought mo&s;t plea&s;ant, were now mo&s;t &s;tupid: Lady Howard,
<PB N="183" REF="182">
who had appeared a chearful and re&s;pectable old lady, now &s;eemed in the common John Trot &s;tyle of other aged dames: Mrs. Mirvan, whom I had e&s;teemed as an amiable piece of &s;till-life, now became &s;o in&s;ipid, that I could hardly keep awake in her company: the daughter too, whom I had regarded as a good-humoured, pretty &s;ort of girl, now &s;eemed too in&s;ignificant for no|tice: and as to the Captain, I had always thought him a booby,&mdash;but now, he appeared a &s;a|vage!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir Clement,"</Q> cried I, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"I will not hear you talk thus of my be&s;t friends."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"but the con|tra&s;t of my two vi&s;its was too &s;triking, not to be mentioned."</Q></P>
<P>He then a&s;ked me what I thought of the ver&s;es?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Either,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"that they are written iron|ically, or by &s;ome madman."</Q></P>
<P>Such a profu&s;ion of compliments en&s;ued, that I was obliged to propo&s;e dancing, in my own de|fence. When we &s;tood up, <Q REND="inline">"I intended,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to have di&s;covered the author by his looks; but I find you &s;o much the general load|&s;tone of attention, that my &s;u&s;picions change their object every moment. Surely you mu&s;t your|&s;elf have &s;ome knowledge who he is?"</Q></P>
<P>I told him, No. But, my dear Sir, I mu&s;t own to you, I have no doubt but that Mr. Macartney, mu&s;t be the author; no one el&s;e would &s;peak of me &s;o partially; and, indeed, his poetical turn puts it, with me, beyond di&s;|pute.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked me a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning Lord Orville; how long he had been at Bri&s;tol?
<PB N="184" REF="183">
&mdash;what time I had &s;pent at Clifton?&mdash;whether he rode out every morning?&mdash;whether I ever tru&s;ted my&s;elf in a phaeton?&mdash;and a multitude of other enquiries, all made with his u&s;ual freedom and impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Fortunately, as I much wi&s;hed to retire early, Lady Loui&s;a makes a point of being among the fir&s;t who quit the rooms, and therefore we got home in very tolerable time.</P>
<P>Lord Orville's reception of us was grave and cold: far from di&s;tingui&s;hing me, as u&s;ual, by particular civilities, Lady Loui&s;a her&s;elf could not have &s;een me enter the room with more fri|gid unconcern, nor have more &s;crupulou&s;ly a|voided honouring me with any notice. But, chiefly I was &s;truck to &s;ee, that he &s;uffered Sir Clement, who &s;tayed &s;upper, to &s;it between us, without any effort to prevent him, though, till then, he had &s;eemed to be even tenacious of a &s;eat next mine.</P>
<P>This little circum&s;tance affected me more than I can expre&s;s: yet I endeavoured to <HI>re|joice</HI> at it, &s;ince neglect and indifference from him may be my be&s;t friends.&mdash;But, alas!&mdash;&s;o &s;uddenly, &s;o abruptly to forfeit his attention!&mdash;to lo&s;e his friend&s;hip!&mdash;Oh, Sir, the&s;e thoughts pierced my &s;oul!&mdash;&s;carce could I keep my &s;eat; for not all my efforts could re&s;train the tears from trickling down my cheeks: however, as Lord Orville &s;aw them not, (for Sir Clement's head was con&s;tantly between us,) I tried to col|lect my &s;pirits, and &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to keep my &s;eat with decency, till Sir Clement took leave: and then, not daring to tru&s;t my eyes to meet tho&s;e of Lord Orville, I retired.</P>
<P>I have been writing ever &s;ince; for, certain that I could not &s;leep, I would not go to bed.
<PB N="185" REF="184">
Tell me, my deare&s;t Sir, if you po&s;&s;ibly can, tell me that you approve my change of con|duct,&mdash;tell me that my altered behaviour to Lord Orville is right,&mdash;that my flying his &s;oci|ety, and avoiding his civilities, are actions which <HI>you</HI> would have dictated.&mdash;Tell me this, and the &s;acrifices I have made will comfort me in the mid&s;t of my regret,&mdash;for never, never can I cea&s;e to regret that I have lo&s;t the friend&s;hip of Lord Orville!&mdash;Oh, Sir, I have &s;lighted,&mdash;have rejected,&mdash;have thrown it away!&mdash;No matter; it was an honour I merited not to pre|&s;erve, and I now &s;ee,&mdash;that my mind was une|qual to &s;u&s;taining it without danger.</P>

The wi&s;h of doing well governs every other, as far as concerns my conduct,&mdash;for am I not <HI>your</HI> child?&mdash;the creature of your own forming?&mdash;Yet, oh Sir, friend, parent of my heart!&mdash;my feel|ings are all at war with my duties; and, while I mo&s;t &s;truggle to acquire &s;elf-approbation, my peace, my hopes, my happine&s;s,&mdash;are lo&s;t!</P>
<P>'Tis you alone can compo&s;e a mind &s;o cruelly agitated; you, I well know, can feel pity for the weakne&s;s to which you are a &s;tranger; and, though you blame the affliction, &s;oothe and com|fort the afflicted.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berry Hill, <DATE>Oct. 3.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t communication, my deare&s;t child, is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing; that an acknowledged daughter, and heire&s;s of Sir John Belmont &s;hould be at Bri&s;tol, and &s;till my Evelina bear the name of Anville, is to me inexplicable; yet the my&s;|tery of the letter to Lady Howard prepared me to expect &s;omething extraordinary upon Sir John Belmont's return to England.</P>
<P>Whoever this young lady may be, it is cer|tain &s;he now takes a place to which you have a right indi&s;putable. An <HI>after-marriage</HI> I never heard of; yet, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a one to have hap|pened, Mi&s;s Evelyn was certainly the fir&s;t wife, and therefore her daughter mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be en|titled to the name of Belmont.</P>
<P>Either there are circum&s;tances in this affair at pre&s;ent utterly incomprehen&s;ible, or el&s;e &s;ome &s;trange and mo&s;t atrocious fraud has been prac|ti&s;ed; which of the&s;e two is the ca&s;e, it now be|hoves us to enquire.</P>
<P>My reluctance to this &s;tep, gives way to my conviction of its propriety, &s;ince the reputation of your dear, and much-injured mother mu&s;t now either be fully cleared from blemi&s;h, or receive its final and indelible wound.</P>
<P>The public appearance of a daughter of Sir John Belmont will revive the remembrance of Mi&s;s Evelyn's &s;tory to all who have heard it,&mdash;who the <HI>mother</HI> was, will be univer&s;ally demanded,
<PB N="187" REF="186">
&mdash;and if any other Lady Belmont &s;hall be named,&mdash;the birth of my Evelina will receive a &s;tigma, again&s;t which, honour, truth, and in|nocence, may appeal in vain! a &s;tigma which will eternally bla&s;t the fair fame of her vir|tuous mother, and ca&s;t upon her blamele&s;s &s;elf, the odium of a title, which not all her purity can re&s;cue from e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;hame and di&s;|honour.</P>
<P>No, my dear child, no; I will not quietly &s;uffer the a&s;hes of your mother to be treated with ignominy. Her &s;potle&s;s character &s;hall be ju&s;ti|fied to the world,&mdash;her marriage &s;hall be ac|knowledged, and her child &s;hall bear the name to which &s;he is lawfully entitled.</P>
<P>It is true, that Mrs. Mirvan would conduct this affair with more delicacy than Mrs. Sel|wyn;&mdash;yet, perhaps, to &s;ave time, is of all con&s;iderations, the mo&s;t important, &s;ince the longer this my&s;tery is &s;uffered to continue, the more difficult my be rendered its expla|nation. The &s;ooner, therefore, my dear, you can &s;et out for town, the le&s;s formidable will be your ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Let not your timidity, my dear love, depre&s;s your &s;pirits: I &s;hall, indeed, tremble for you, at a meeting &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;o affecting, yet there can be no doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s of your application:&mdash;I enclo&s;e a letter from your un|happy mother, written, and re&s;erved purpo&s;e|ly, for this occa&s;ion: Mrs. Clinton, too, who attended her in her la&s;t illne&s;s, mu&s;t accom|pany you to town.&mdash;But, without any other certificate of your birth, that which you carry in your countenance, as it could not be effected by artifice, &s;o it cannot admit of the &s;malle&s;t doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="187">
And now, my Evelina, committed, at length, to the care of your real parent, receive the fer|vent prayers, wi&s;hes, and ble&s;&s;ings, of him who &s;o fondly adopted you!</P>
<P>May'&s;t thou, oh child of my bo&s;om! may'&s;t thou, in this change of &s;ituation, experience no change of di&s;po&s;ition! but receive with humility, and &s;upport with meekne&s;s, the elevation to which thou art ri&s;ing! May thy manners, language, and deportment, all evince that mode&s;t equanimi|ty, and chearful gratitude, which not merely de|&s;erve, but dignify pro&s;perity! May'&s;t thou, to the la&s;t moments of an unblemi&s;hed life, retain thy genuine &s;implicity, thy &s;inglene&s;s of heart, thy guilele&s;s &s;incerity! and may'&s;t thou, &s;tranger to o&s;tentation, and &s;uperior to in&s;olence, with true greatne&s;s of &s;oul, &s;hine forth con&s;picuous on|ly in beneficence!</P>

<P>IN the firm hope that the moment of angui&s;h which approaches will prove the period of my &s;uf|ferrings, once more I addre&s;s my&s;elf to Sir John Belmont, in behalf of the child, who, if it &s;ur|vives its mother, will hereafter be the bearer of this letter.</P>

Yet in what terms,&mdash;oh mo&s;t cruel of men!&mdash;can the lo&s;t Caroline addre&s;s you, and not ad|dre&s;s you in vain?

<P>Shall I call you by the loved, the re&s;pected ti|tle of hu&s;band?&mdash;No, you di&s;claim it!&mdash;the fa|ther of my infant?&mdash;No, you doom it to infamy!&mdash;the lover who re&s;cued me from a forced mar|riage?&mdash;No, you have your&s;elf betrayed me!&mdash;the friend from whom I hoped &s;uccour and protec|tion?&mdash;No, you have con&s;igned me to mi&s;ery and de&s;truction!</P>
<P>Oh hardened again&s;t every plea of ju&s;tice, re|mor&s;e, or pity! how, and in what manner, may I hope to move thee? Is there one method I have left untried? remains there one re&s;ource une&s;&s;ayed? No; I have exhau&s;ted all the bit|terne&s;s of reproach, and drained every &s;luice of compa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>Hopele&s;s, and almo&s;t de&s;perate, twenty times have I flung away my pen;&mdash;but the feelings of a mother, a mother agonizing for the fate of her child, again animating my courage, as often I have re&s;umed it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Clifton, <DATE>Oct. 3d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning I &s;aw from my window, that Lord Orville was walking in the garden; but I would not go down &s;tairs till breakfa&s;t was ready: and then, he paid me his compliments almo&s;t as coldly as Lady Loui&s;a paid her's.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="191">
I took my u&s;ual place, and Mrs. Beaumont, Lady Loui&s;a, and Mrs. Selwyn, entered into their u&s;ual conver&s;ation.&mdash;Not &s;o your Evelina: di&s;re|garded, &s;ilent, and melancholy, &s;he &s;at like a cy|pher, whom to nobody belonging, by nobody was noticed.</P>
<P>Ill brooking &s;uch a &s;ituation, and unable to &s;up|port the neglect of Lord Orville, the moment breakfa&s;t was over, I left the room; and was going up &s;tairs, when, very unplea&s;antly, I was &s;topped by Sir Clement Willoughby, who, flying into the hall, prevented my proceeding.</P>
<P>He enquired very particularly after my health, and entreated me to return into the parlour. Un|willingly I con&s;ented, but thought any thing pre|ferable to continuing alone with him; and he would neither leave me, nor &s;uffer me to pa&s;s on. Yet, in returning, I felt not a little a&s;hamed of appearing thus to take the vi&s;it of Sir Cle|ment to my&s;elf. And, indeed, he took pains, by his manner of addre&s;&s;ing me, to give it that air.</P>
<P>He &s;tayed, I believe, two hours; nor would he, perhaps, even then have gone, had not Mrs. Beaumont broken up the party, by propo&s;ing an airing in her coach. Lady Loui&s;a con&s;ented to accompany her: but Mrs. Selwyn, when applied to, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If my Lord, or Sir Clement, will join us, I &s;hall be happy to make one;&mdash;but really, a trio of females will be nervous to the la&s;t degree."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Clement readily agreed to attend them; indeed, he makes it his evident &s;tudy to court the favour of Mrs. Beaumont. Lord Orville excu&s;ed him&s;elf from going out; and I retired to my own room. What he did with him&s;elf I know not, for I would not go down &s;tairs till din|ner
<PB N="193" REF="192">
was ready: his coldne&s;s, though my own change of behaviour has occa&s;ioned it, &s;o cruelly depre&s;&s;es my &s;pirits, that I know not how to &s;up|port my&s;elf in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>At dinner, I found Sir Clement again of the party. Indeed he manages every thing his own way; for Mrs. Beaumont, though by no means ea&s;y to plea&s;e, &s;eems quite at his di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>The dinner, the afternoon, and the evening, were to me the mo&s;t irk&s;ome imaginable: I was tormented by the a&s;&s;iduity of Sir Clement, who not only <HI>took,</HI> but <HI>made</HI> opportunities of &s;peaking to me,&mdash;and I was hurt,&mdash;oh how inexpre&s;&s;ibly hurt!&mdash;that Lord Orville not only forbore, as hi|therto, <HI>&s;eeking,</HI> he even <HI>neglected</HI> all occa&s;ions of talking with me!</P>
<P>I begin to think, my dear Sir, that the &s;udden alteration in my behaviour was ill judged and im|proper; for, as I had received no offence, as the cau&s;e of the change was upon <HI>my</HI> account, not <HI>his,</HI> I &s;hould not have a&s;&s;umed, &s;o abruptly, a re&s;erve for which I dared a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on,&mdash;nor have &s;hun|ned his pre&s;ence &s;o obviou&s;ly, without con&s;idering the &s;trange appearance of &s;uch a conduct.</P>
<P>Alas, my deare&s;t Sir, that my reflections &s;hould always be too late to &s;erve me! dearly, indeed, do I purcha&s;e experience! and much I fear I &s;hall &s;uffer yet more &s;everely, from the heedle&s;s indi&s;|cretion of my temper, ere I attain that prudence and con&s;ideration, which, by fore&s;eeing di&s;tant con&s;equences, may rule and direct in pre&s;ent ex|igencies.</P>

<P>Ye&s;terday morning, every body rode out, ex|cept Mrs. Selwyn and my&s;elf: and we two &s;at for &s;ome time together in her room; but as &s;oon as I
<PB N="194" REF="193">
could, I quitted her, to &s;aunter in the garden; for &s;he diverts her&s;elf &s;o unmercifully with rally|ing me, either upon my gravity,&mdash;or concerning Lord Orville,&mdash;that I dread having any conver&s;a|tion with her.</P>
<P>Here I believe I &s;pent an hour by my&s;elf; when, hearing the garden-gate open, I went into an arbour at the end of a long walk, where ruminating, very unplea&s;antly, upon my future pro&s;pects, I remained quietly &s;eated but a few minutes, ere I was interrupted by the appearance of Sir Clement Willoughby.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted; and would have left the arbour, but he prevented me. Indeed I am almo&s;t certain he had heard in the hou&s;e where I was, as it is not, otherwi&s;e, probable he would have &s;trolled down the garden alone.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Stop, &s;top,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"lovelie&s;t and mo&s;t beloved of women, &s;top and hear me!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, making me keep my place, he &s;at down by me, and would have taken my hand; but I drew it back, and &s;aid I could not &s;tay.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you, then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"refu&s;e me even the &s;malle&s;t gratification, though, but ye&s;|terday, I almo&s;t &s;uffered martyrdom for the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Martyrdom! Sir Clement."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, beauteous In&s;en&s;ible! <HI>martyrdom:</HI> for did I not compel my&s;elf to be immured in a car|riage, the tedious length of a whole morning, with the three mo&s;t fatiguing women in Eng|land?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon my word, the Ladies are extremely obliged to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">they have, every one of them, &s;o copious a &s;hare of their own per&s;onal e&s;teem, that they have no right to repine at the
<PB N="195" REF="194">
failure of it in the world; and, indeed, they will them&s;elves be the la&s;t to di&s;cover it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How little,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"are tho&s;e Ladies aware of &s;uch &s;everity from <HI>you!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They are guarded,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o happily and &s;o &s;ecurely by their own conceit, that they are not aware of it from any body. Oh Mi&s;s Anville, to be torn away from <HI>you,</HI> in order to be &s;hut up with <HI>them,</HI>&mdash;is there a human being, except your cruel &s;elf, could forbear to pity me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir Clement, however hardly you may choo&s;e to judge of them, your &s;ituation, by the world in general would rather have been envi|ed, than pitied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The world in general,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"has the &s;ame opinion of them that I have my&s;elf: Mrs. Beaumont is every where laughed at, Lady Loui&s;a ridiculed, and Mrs Selwyn hated."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God, Sir Clement, what cruel &s;trength of words do you u&s;e!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is you, my angel, are to blame, &s;ince your perfections have rendered their faults &s;o glaring. I prote&s;t to you, during our whole ride, I thought the carriage drawn by &s;nails. The ab&s;urd pride of Mrs. Beaumont, and the re&s;pect &s;he ex|acts, are at once in&s;ufferable and &s;tupifying; had I never before been in her company, I &s;hould have concluded that this had been her fir&s;t airing from the herald's-office,&mdash;and wi&s;hed her nothing wor&s;e than that it might al&s;o be the la&s;t. I a&s;&s;ure you, that but for gaining the freedom of her hou&s;e, I would fly her as I would plague, pe&s;tilence, and famine. Mrs. Selwyn, indeed, afforded &s;ome relief from this formality, but the un|bounded licence of her tongue&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="195">
<Q REND="inline">"O Sir Clement, do <HI>you</HI> object to that?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, my &s;weet reproacher, in a <HI>woman</HI> I do; in a <HI>woman</HI> I think it intolerable. She has wit, I acknowledge, and more under&s;tanding than half her &s;ex put together; but &s;he keeps alive a per|petual expectation of &s;atire, that &s;preads a gene|ral unea&s;ine&s;s among all who are in her pre&s;ence; and &s;he talks &s;o much, that even the be&s;t things &s;he &s;ays, weary the attention. As to the little Loui&s;a, 'tis &s;uch a pretty piece of languor, that 'tis almo&s;t cruel to &s;peak rationally about her,&mdash;el&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay, &s;he is a mere compound of af|fectation, impertinence, and airs."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am quite amazed,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"that, with &s;uch opinions, you can behave to them all with &s;o much attention and civility."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Civility! my angel,&mdash;why, I could wor&s;hip, could adore them, only to procure my&s;elf a mo|ment of your conver&s;ation! Have you not &s;een me pay my court to the gro&s;s Captain Mirvan, and the virago Madame Duval? Were it po&s;&s;ible that a creature &s;o horrid could be formed, as to partake of the wor&s;t qualities of all the&s;e charac|ters,&mdash;a creature who &s;hould have the haughtine&s;s of Mrs. Beaumont, the brutality of Captain Mir|van, the &s;elf-conceit of Mrs. Selwyn, the affecta|tion of Lady Loui&s;a, and the vulgarity of Ma|dame Duval,&mdash;even to &s;uch a mon&s;ter as that, I would pay homage, and pour forth adulation, on|ly to obtain one word, one look from my adored Mi&s;s Anville!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"you are greatly mi&s;taken if you &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch duplicity of charac|ter recommends you to my good opinion. But I mu&s;t take this opportunity of begging you never more to talk to me in this &s;train."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="196">
<Q REND="inline">"Oh Mi&s;s Anville, your reproofs, your cold|ne&s;s, pierce me to the &s;oul! look upon me with le&s;s rigour, and make me what you plea&s;e;&mdash;you &s;hall govern and direct all my actions,&mdash;you &s;hall new-form, new-model me:&mdash;I will not have even a wi&s;h but of your &s;ugge&s;tion;&mdash;only deign to look upon me with pity,&mdash;if not with fa|vour!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Suffer me, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, very gravely, <Q REND="inline">"to make u&s;e of this occa&s;ion to put a final conclu&s;ion to &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions. I entreat you never again to addre&s;s me in a language &s;o flighty, and &s;o unwel|come.

<P>I then ro&s;e, and was going, but he flung him|&s;elf at my feet to prevent me, exclaiming, in a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate manner, <Q REND="inline">"Good God! Mi&s;s An|ville, what do you &s;ay?&mdash;is it, can it be po&s;&s;ible, that &s;o unmoved, that with &s;uch petrifying indif|ference, you can tear from me even the remote&s;t hope?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not, Sir, &s;aid I,"</Q> endeavouring to di&s;engage my&s;elf from him, <Q REND="inline">"what hope you mean, but I am &s;ure I never intended to give you any."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You di&s;tract me!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot endure &s;uch &s;corn;&mdash;I be&s;eech you to have &s;ome moderation in your cruelty, le&s;t you make me de&s;|perate:&mdash;&s;ay, then, that you pity me,&mdash;O faire&s;t inexorable! lovelie&s;t tyrant!&mdash;&s;ay, tell me, at lea&s;t, that you pity me!</Q></P>

<P>Lord Orville then, ha&s;tily approaching us, &s;aid, with great &s;pirit, <Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement, you cannot wi&s;h to detain Mi&s;s Anville by force!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neither, my Lord,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, proudly, <Q REND="inline">"do I reque&s;t the honour of your Lord|&s;hip's interference."</Q></P>
<P>However, he let go my hand, and I immedi|ately ran into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was now frightened to death, le&s;t Sir Cle|ment's mortified pride &s;hould provoke him to af|front Lord Orville: I therefore ran ha&s;tily to Mrs. Selwyn, and entreated her, in a manner hardly to be under&s;tood, to walk towards the ar|bour. She a&s;ked no que&s;tions, for &s;he is quick as lightening in taking a hint, but in&s;tantly ha&s;tened into the garden.</P>
<P>Imagine, my dear Sir, how wretched I mu&s;t be till I &s;aw her return! &s;carce could I re&s;train my&s;elf from running back; however, I checked my impatience, and waited, though in agonies, till &s;he came.</P>
<P>And, now, my dear Sir, I have a conver&s;ation to write, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to me that I ever heard. The comments and que&s;tions with which Mrs. Selwyn interrupted her account, I &s;hall not mention; for they are &s;uch as you may very ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="198">
Lord Orville and Sir Clement were both &s;eated very quietly in the arbour; and Mrs. Selwyn, &s;tanding &s;till, as &s;oon as &s;he was within a few yards of them, heard Sir Clement &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Your que&s;tion, my Lord, alarms me, and I can by no means an&s;wer it, unle&s;s you will allow me to pro|po&s;e another."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Undoubtedly, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You a&s;k me, my Lord, what are my inten|tions?&mdash;I &s;hould be very happy to be &s;atisfied as to your Lord&s;hip's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have never, Sir, profe&s;&s;ed <HI>any.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Here they were both, for a few moments, &s;i|lent; and then Sir Clement &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"To what, my Lord, mu&s;t I, then, impute your de&s;ire of knowing mine?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To an unaffected intere&s;t in Mi&s;s Anville's welfare."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Such an intere&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Clement, drily, <Q REND="inline">"is, indeed, very generous; but, except in a father,&mdash;a brother,&mdash;or a lover&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement,</Q> interrupted his Lord&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"I know your inferrence; and I acknowledge I have not the right of enquiry which any of tho&s;e three titles be&s;tow; and yet I confe&s;s the warme&s;t wi&s;h|es to &s;erve her, and to &s;ee her happy. Will you then, excu&s;e me, if I take the liberty to repeat my que&s;tion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, if your Lord&s;hip will excu&s;e my re|peating, that I think it a rather extraordinary one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It may be &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville; <Q REND="inline">"but this young lady &s;eems to be peculiarly &s;ituated; &s;he is very young, very inexperienced, yet ap|pears to be left totally to her own direction. She does not, I believe, &s;ee the dangers to which &s;he
<PB N="200" REF="199">
is expo&s;ed, and I will own to you, I feel a &s;trong de&s;ire to point them out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't rightly under&s;tand your Lord&s;hip,&mdash;but I think you cannot mean to prejudice her a|gain&s;t me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Her &s;entiments of <HI>you,</HI> Sir, are as much un|known to me, as your intentions towards <HI>her.</HI>&mdash;Perhaps, were I acquainted with either, my offi|ciou&s;ne&s;s would be at an end: but I pre&s;ume not to a&s;k upon what terms&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Here he &s;topped; and Sir Clement &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You know, my Lord, I am not given to de&s;pair; I am by no means &s;uch a puppy as to tell you I am upon <HI>&s;ure ground,</HI> however, per&s;everance&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are then, Sir, determined to per&s;e|vere?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, then, Sir Clement, if I &s;peak to you with freedom. This young lady, though &s;he &s;eems alone, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, unpro|tected, is not entirely without friends; &s;he has been extremely well educated, and accu&s;tomed to good company; &s;he has a natural love of virtue, and a mind that might adorn <HI>any</HI> &s;tation, howe|ver exalted: is &s;uch a young lady, Sir Clement, a proper object to trifle with?&mdash;for your princi|ples, excu&s;e me, Sir, are well known."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to that, my Lord, let Mi&s;s Anville look to her&s;elf; &s;he has an excellent under&s;tanding, and needs no coun&s;ellor."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Her under&s;tanding is, indeed, excellent;&mdash;but &s;he is too young for &s;u&s;picion, and has an artle&s;&s;ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, that I never &s;aw equalled."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, warmly, <Q REND="inline">"your prai&s;es make me doubt your di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s, and there exi&s;ts not the man who I would
<PB N="201" REF="200">
&s;o unwillingly have for a rival as your&s;elf. But you mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay, you have greatly de|ceived me in regard to this affair."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, Sir?"</Q> cried Lord Orville, with equal warmth.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You were plea&s;ed, my Lord,"</Q> an&s;wered Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"upon our fir&s;t conver&s;ation con|cerning this young lady, to &s;peak of her in terms by no means &s;uited to your pre&s;ent encomiums; you &s;aid, &s;he was a <HI>poor, weak, ignorant girl;</HI> and I had great rea&s;on to believe, you had a mo&s;t contemptuous opinion of her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is very true,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"that "I did not, at our fir&s;t acquaintance, do ju&s;tice to the merit of Mi&s;s Anville; but I knew not, then, how new &s;he was to the world; at pre&s;ent however, I am convinced, that whatever might ap|pear &s;trange in her behaviour, was &s;imply the ef|fect of inexperience, timidity, and a retired edu|cation; for I find her informed, &s;en&s;ible, and intelligent. She is not, indeed, like mo&s;t modern young ladies, to be known in half an hour; her mode&s;t worth, and fearful excellence, require both time and encouragement to &s;hew them&s;elves. She does not, beautiful as &s;he is, &s;eize the &s;oul by &s;urprize, but, with more dangerous fa&s;cination, &s;he &s;teals it almo&s;t imperceptibly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Enough, my Lord,"</Q> cried Sir Clement, <Q REND="inline">"your &s;olicitude for her welfare is now &s;uffici|ently explained."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My friend&s;hip and e&s;teem,"</Q> returned Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"I do not wi&s;h to di&s;gui&s;e; but, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, Sir Clement, I &s;hould not have troubled <HI>you</HI> upon this &s;ubject, had Mi&s;s Anville and I ever conver&s;ed but as friends. However, &s;ince you do not chu&s;e to avow your intentions, we mu&s;t drop the &s;ubject."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="201">
<Q REND="inline">"My intentions,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I will frankly own, are hardly known to my&s;elf. I think Mi&s;s Anville the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex, and were I a <HI>marrying man,</HI> &s;he, of all the women I have &s;een, I would fix upon for a wife: but, I believe, that not even the philo&s;ophy of your Lord&s;hip, would recommend to me a connection of that &s;ort, with a girl of ob&s;cure birth, who&s;e only dowry is her beauty; and who is evidently in a &s;tate of de|pendency."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement,"</Q> cried Lord Orville, with &s;ome heat, <Q REND="inline">"we will di&s;cu&s;s this point no further; we are both free agents, and mu&s;t act for our|&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>Here Mrs. Selwyn, fearing a &s;urpri&s;e, and, finding my apprehen&s;ions of danger were ground|le&s;s, retired ha&s;tily into another walk, and &s;oon after came to give me this account.</P>
<P>Good Heaven, what a man is this Sir Clement! &s;o de&s;igning, though &s;o ea&s;y; &s;o deliberately art|ful, though &s;o flighty! Greatly, however, is he mi&s;taken, all confident as he &s;eems, for the girl, ob&s;cure, poor, dependent as &s;he is, far from wi&s;h|ing the honour of his alliance, would, not only <HI>now,</HI> but <HI>always</HI> have rejected it.</P>
<P>As to Lord Orville,&mdash;but I will not tru&s;t my pen to mention him,&mdash;tell me, my dear Sir, what <HI>you</HI> think of him?&mdash;tell me if he is not the no|ble&s;t of men?&mdash;and if you can either wonder at, or blame my admiration?</P>
<P>The idea of being &s;een by either party, im|mediately after &s;o &s;ingular a conver&s;ation, was both awkward and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to me; but I was obliged to appear at dinner. Sir Clement, I &s;aw was ab&s;ent and unea&s;y; he watched me, he watch|ed Lord Orville, and was evidently di&s;turbed in his mind. Whenever he &s;poke to me, I turned
<PB N="203" REF="202">
from him with undi&s;gui&s;ed di&s;dain, for I am too much irritated again&s;t him, to bear with his ill|meant a&s;&s;iduities any longer.</P>
<P>But, not once,&mdash;not a moment did I dare meet the eyes of Lord Orville! All con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s my|&s;elf, I dreaded his penetration, and directed mine every way&mdash;but towards his. The re&s;t of the day, I never quitted Mrs. Selwyn.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Sir: to-morrow I expect your directions whether I am to return to Berry Hill, or once more vi&s;it London.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Clifton, <DATE>October 6th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AND now, my deare&s;t Sir, if the perturba|tion of my &s;pirits will allow me, I will fini&s;h my la&s;t letter from Clifton Hill.</P>
<P>This morning, though I did not go down &s;tairs early, I was the only per&s;on in the parlour when Lord Orville entered it. I felt no &s;mall confu&s;ion at &s;eeing him alone, after having &s;o long and &s;ucce&s;sfully avoided &s;uch a meeting. As &s;oon as the u&s;ual compliments were over, I would have left the room, but he &s;topped me by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"If I di&s;turb you, Mi&s;s Anville, I am gone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, rather embarra&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"I was ju&s;t going."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I flattered my&s;elf,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have had a moment's conver&s;ation with you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="203">
I then turned back; and he &s;eemed him&s;elf in &s;ome perplexity: but after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"You are very good,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to indulge my re|que&s;t; I have, indeed, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, mo&s;t ardently de&s;ired an opportunity of &s;peaking to you."</Q></P>
<P>Again he pau&s;ed; but I &s;aid nothing, &s;o he went on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You allowed me, Madam, a few days &s;ince, you allowed me to lay claim to your friend&s;hip,&mdash;to intere&s;t my&s;elf in your concerns,&mdash;to call you by the affectionate title of &s;i&s;ter,&mdash;and the ho|nour you did me, no man could have been more &s;en&s;ible of; I am ignorant, therefore, how I have been &s;o unfortunate as to forfeit it:&mdash;but at pre&s;ent, all is changed! you fly me,&mdash;your averted eye &s;huns to meet mine, and you &s;edulou&s;|ly avoid my conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>I was extremely di&s;concerted at this grave, and but too ju&s;t accu&s;ation, and I am &s;ure I mu&s;t look very &s;imple;&mdash;but I made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will not, I hope,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"con|demn me unheard; if there is any thing I have done,&mdash;or any thing I have neglected, tell me, I be&s;eech you, <HI>what,</HI> and it &s;hall be the whole &s;tudy of my thoughts how to de&s;erve your par|don."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, penetrated at once with &s;hame and gratitude, <Q REND="inline">"your too, too great politene&s;s oppre&s;&s;es me!&mdash;you have done nothing,&mdash;I have never dreamt of offence;&mdash;if there is any pardon to be a&s;ked, it is rather for <HI>me,</HI> than for <HI>you,</HI> to a&s;k it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are all &s;weetne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"and I flatter my&s;elf, you will again allow me to claim tho&s;e titles, which I find my|&s;elf &s;o unable to forego. Yet, occupied as I am,
<PB N="205" REF="204">
with an idea that gives me the &s;evere&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, I hope you will not think me impertinent, if I &s;till &s;olicit, &s;till entreat, nay implore you tell me, to what cau&s;e your late &s;udden, and to me mo&s;t painful re&s;erve, was owing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, &s;tammering, <Q REND="inline">"I dont,&mdash;I can't,&mdash;indeed, my Lord,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry to di&s;tre&s;s you,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"and a&s;hamed to be &s;o urgent,&mdash;yet I know not how to be &s;atisfied while in ignorance,&mdash;and the <HI>time</HI> when the change happened, makes me apprehend&mdash;may I, Mi&s;s Anville, tell you <HI>what</HI> it makes me apprehend?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tell me, then,"</Q>&mdash;and pardon a que&s;tion mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially important to me;&mdash;Had, or had not, Sir Clement Willoughby, any &s;hare in cau&s;|ing your inquietude?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord,"</Q> an&s;wered I, with firmne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"none in the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A thou&s;and, thou&s;and thanks!"</Q> cried he: <Q REND="inline">"you have relieved me from a weight of con|jecture which I &s;upported very painfully. But one thing more; is it, in any mea&s;ure, to Sir Clement that I may attribute the alteration in your behaviour to my&s;elf, which, I could not but ob&s;erve, began the very day of his arrival at the Hotwells?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To Sir Clement, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"at|tribute nothing. He is the la&s;t man in the world who would have any influence over my conduct."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And will you, then, re&s;tore to me that &s;hare of confidence and favour with which you honour|ed me before he came?"</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, to my great relief,&mdash;for I knew not what to &s;ay,&mdash;Mrs. Beaumont opened the door,
<PB N="206" REF="205">
and, in a few minutes, we went to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Lord Orville was all gaiety; never did I &s;ee him more lively or more agreeable. Very &s;oon after, Sir Clement Willoughby called to pay his re&s;pects, he &s;aid, to Mrs. Beaumont. I then came to my own roon, where, indulging my re|flections, which now &s;oothed, and now alarmed me, I remained very quietly, till I received your mo&s;t kind letter.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, how &s;weet are the prayers you offer for your Evelina! how grateful to her are the ble&s;&s;ings you pour upon her head!&mdash;You <HI>commit me to my real parent.</HI>&mdash;Ah, Guardian, Friend, Protector of my youth!&mdash;by whom my helple&s;s infancy was cheri&s;hed, my mind formed, my ve|ry life pre&s;erved,&mdash;<HI>you</HI> are the parent my heart acknowledges, and to you do I vow eternal duty, gratitude, and affection.</P>
<P>I look forward to the approaching interview with more fear than hope; but important as is this &s;ubject, I am, ju&s;t now, wholly engro&s;&s;|ed with another, which I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to com|municate.</P>
<P>I immediately acquainted Mrs. Selwyn with the purport of your letter. She was charmed to find your opinion agreed with her own, and &s;ettled that we &s;hould go to town to-morrow morning. And a chai&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> actually ordered to be here by one o'clock.</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired me to pack up my cloaths; and &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t go, her&s;elf, to <HI>make &s;peeches,</HI> and <HI>tell lies</HI> to Mrs. Beaumont.</P>
<P>When I went down &s;tairs to dinner, Lord Or|ville, who was &s;till in excellent &s;pirits, reproached me for &s;ecluding my&s;elf &s;o much from the com|pany. He &s;at next me,&mdash;he <HI>would</HI> &s;it next me,&mdash;at table; and he might, I am &s;ure, repeat what
<PB N="207" REF="206">
heonce &s;aid of me before, <HI>that he almo&s;t exhau&s;ted him&s;elf in fruitle&s;s endeavours to entertain me;</HI>&mdash;for, indeed, I was not to be entertained: I was totally &s;piritle&s;s and dejected; the idea of the approaching meeting,&mdash;and oh Sir, the idea of the approaching parting,&mdash;gave a heavine&s;s to my heart, that I could neither conquer nor repre&s;s. I even regretted the half explanation that had pa&s;&s;ed, and wi&s;hed Lord Orville had &s;upport|ed his own re&s;erve, and &s;uffered me to &s;upport mine.</P>
<P>However, when, during dinner, Mrs. Beau|mont &s;poke of our journey, my gravity was no longer &s;ingular; a cloud in&s;tantly over&s;pread the countenance of Lord Orville, and he became near|ly as thoughtful and as &s;ilent as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>We all went together to the drawing-room. After a &s;hort and unentertaining conver&s;ation, Mrs. Selwyn &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t prepare for her jour|ney, and begged me to &s;ee for &s;ome books &s;he had left in the parlour.</P>
<P>And here, while I was looking for them, I was followed by Lord Orville. He &s;hut the door after he came in, and approaching me with a look of great anxiety, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Is this true, Mi&s;s Anville, are you going?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe &s;o, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, &s;till looking for the books.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So &s;uddenly, &s;o unexpectedly mu&s;t I lo&s;e you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No great lo&s;s, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, endea|vouring to &s;peak chearfully.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> &s;aid he, gravely, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s An|ville can doubt my &s;incerity?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can't imagine,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"what Mrs. Sel|wyn has done with the&s;e books."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="207">
<Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"I might flatter my&s;elf you would allow me to prove it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t run up &s;tairs,"</Q> cried I, greatly confu&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"and a&s;k what &s;he has done with them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are going, then,"</Q> cried he, taking my hand, <Q REND="inline">"and you give me not the &s;malle&s;t hope of your return!&mdash;will you not, then, my too lovely friend!&mdash;will you not, at lea&s;t, teach me, with fortitude like your own, to &s;upport your ab|&s;ence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried I, endeavouring to di&s;en|gage my hand, <Q REND="inline">"pray let me go!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will,"</Q> cried he, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible con|fu&s;ion, dropping on one knee, <Q REND="inline">"if you wi&s;h to leave me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</Q> exclaimed I, <Q REND="inline">"ri&s;e, I be&s;eech you, ri&s;e!&mdash;&s;uch a po&s;ture to me!&mdash;&s;urely your Lord&s;hip is not &s;o cruel as to mock me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mock you!"</Q> repeated he earne&s;tly, <Q REND="inline">"no, I revere you! I e&s;teem and I admire you above all human beings!&mdash;you are the friend to whom my &s;oul is attached as to its better half! you are the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t perfect of women! and you are dearer to me than language has the power of telling!"</Q></P>
<P>I attempt not to de&s;cribe my &s;en&s;ations at that moment; I &s;carce breathed; I doubted if I ex|i&s;ted,&mdash;the blood for&s;ook my cheeks, and my feet refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain me: Lord Orville, ha&s;tily ri&s;ing, &s;upported me to a chair, upon which I &s;unk, almo&s;t lifele&s;s.</P>
<P>For a few minutes, we neither of us &s;poke; and then, &s;eeing me recover, Lord Orville, though in terms hardly articulate, entreated my pardon
<PB N="209" REF="208">
for his abruptne&s;s. The moment my &s;trength re|turned, I attempted to ri&s;e, but he would not per|mit me.</P>
<P>I cannot write the &s;cene that followed, though every word is engraven on my heart: but his prote&s;tations, his expre&s;&s;ions, were too flattering for repetition: nor would he, in &s;pite of my re|peated efforts to leave him, &s;uffer me to e&s;cape;&mdash;in &s;hort, my dear Sir, I was not proof again&s;t his &s;olicitations&mdash;and he drew from me the mo&s;t &s;acred &s;ecret of my heart!</P>
<P>I know not how long we were together, but Lord Orville was upon his knees, when the door was opened by Mrs. Selwyn! To tell you, Sir, the &s;hame with which I was overwhelmed, would be impo&s;&s;ible;&mdash;I &s;natched my hand from Lord Orville,&mdash;he, too, &s;tarted and ro&s;e, and Mrs. Selwyn, for &s;ome in&s;tants, &s;tood facing us both in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;arca&s;tically, <Q REND="inline">"have you been &s;o good as to help Mi&s;s Anville to look for my books?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, attempting to ral|ly, <Q REND="inline">"and I hope we &s;hall &s;oon be able to find them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip is extremely kind,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, drily, <Q REND="inline">"but I can by no means con&s;ent to take up any more of your time."</Q> Then looking on the window-&s;eat, &s;he pre&s;ently found the books, and added, <Q REND="inline">"Come, here are ju&s;t three, and &s;o, like the &s;ervants in the Drummer, this important affair may give employment to us all."</Q> She then pre&s;ented one to Lord Orville, another to me, and taking a third her&s;elf, with a mo&s;t provoking look, &s;he left the room.</P>
<P>I would in&s;tantly have followed her; but Lord Orville, who could not help laughing, begged me
<PB N="210" REF="209">
to &s;tay a minute, as he had many important mat|ters to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, my Lord, I cannot,&mdash;perhaps I have already &s;tayed too long."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Does Mi&s;s Anville &s;o &s;oon repent her good|ne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;carce know what I do, my Lord,&mdash;I am quite bewildered!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"One hour's conver&s;ation,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"will I hope compo&s;e your &s;pirits, and confirm my hap|pine&s;s. When, then, may I hope to &s;ee you alone?&mdash;&s;hall you walk in the garden to-morrow before breakfa&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no, my Lord; you mu&s;t not, a &s;e|cond time, reproach me with making an <HI>appoint|ment.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you, then,"</Q> &s;aid he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"re|&s;erve that honour only for Mr. Macartney?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Macartney,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"is poor, and thinks him&s;elf obliged to me; otherwi&s;e&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poverty,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I will not plead; but if being <HI>obliged</HI> to you has any weight, who &s;hall di&s;pute <HI>my</HI> title to an appointment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord, I can &s;tay no longer,&mdash;Mrs. Sel|wyn will lo&s;e all patience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Deprive her not of the plea&s;ure of her <HI>con|jectures;</HI>&mdash;but, tell me, are you under Mrs. Sel|wyn's care?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Only for the pre&s;ent, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not a few are the que&s;tions I have to a&s;k Mi&s;s Anville: among them, the mo&s;t important is, whether &s;he depends wholly on her&s;elf, or whether there is any other per&s;on for who&s;e inte|re&s;t I mu&s;t &s;olicit?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hardly know, my Lord, I hardly know my|&s;elf to whom I mo&s;t belong!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="210">
<Q REND="inline">"Suffer, &s;uffer me then,"</Q> cried he, with warmth, <Q REND="inline">"to ha&s;ten the time when that &s;hall no longer admit a doubt!&mdash;when your grateful Orville may call you all his own!"</Q></P>
<P>At length, but with difficulty, I broke from him. I went, however, to my own room, for I was too much agitated to follow Mrs. Selwyn. Good God, my dear Sir, what a &s;cene! &s;urely the meeting for which I &s;hall prepare to-morrow, cannot &s;o greatly affect me! To be loved by Lord Orville,&mdash;to be the honoured choice of his noble heart,&mdash;my happine&s;s &s;eemed too infinite to be borne, and I wept, even bitterly I wept, from the exce&s;s of joy which over-powered me.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of almo&s;t painful felicity, I conti|nued, till I was &s;ummoned to tea. When I re|entered the drawing-room, I rejoiced much to find it full of company, as the confu&s;ion with which I met Lord Orville was rendered the le&s;s ob&s;erv|able.</P>
<P>Immediately after tea, mo&s;t of the company played at cards, and then,&mdash;and till &s;upper|time, Lord Orville devoted him&s;elf wholly to me.</P>
<P>He &s;aw that my eyes were red, and would not let me re&s;t till he had made me confe&s;s the cau&s;e; and when, though mo&s;t reluctantly, I had acknowledged my weakne&s;s, I could with difficul|ty refrain from weeping again at the gratitude he expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know if my journey could not be po&s;tponed; and when I &s;aid no, en|treated permi&s;&s;ion to attend me to town.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"what a re|que&s;t!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;ooner,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"I make my devotion to you public, the &s;ooner I may expect,
<PB N="212" REF="211">
from your delicacy, you will convince the world you encourage no mere <HI>danglers.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You teach me, then, my Lord, the inference I might expect, if I complied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can you wonder I &s;hould &s;eek to ha&s;ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he happy time, when no &s;cruples, no di&s;cretion, will demand our &s;eparation? and when the mo&s;t punctilious delicacy will rather promote, than op|po&s;e, my happine&s;s in attending you?"</Q></P>
<P>To this I was &s;ilent, and he re-urged his re|que&s;t.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"you a&s;k what I have no power to grant. This journey will deprive me of all right to act for my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What does Mi&s;s Anville mean?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot now explain my&s;elf; indeed, if I could, the ta&s;k would be both painful and te|dious."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"when may I hope to date the period of this my&s;tery? when flatter my&s;elf that my promi&s;ed friend will indeed honour me with her confidence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"I mean not to affect any my&s;tery,&mdash;but my affairs are &s;o circum|&s;tanced, that a long and mo&s;t unhappy &s;tory, can alone explain them. However, if a &s;hort &s;u&s;pence will give your Lord&s;hip any unea&s;i|ne&s;s,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My beloved Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> cried he eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"pardon my impatience!&mdash;You &s;hall tell me no|thing you would wi&s;h to conceal,&mdash;I will wait your own time for information, and tru&s;t to your good|ne&s;s for its &s;peed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is <HI>nothing,</HI> my Lord, I wi&s;h to conceal;&mdash;to <HI>po&s;tpone</HI> an explanation is all I de&s;ire."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="212">
He then reque&s;ted, that, &s;ince I would not al|low him to accompany me to town, I would permit him to write to me, and promi&s;e to an&s;wer his letters.</P>
<P>A &s;udden recollection of the two letters which had already pa&s;&s;ed between us, occurring to me, I ha&s;tily an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, my Lord!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am extremely &s;orry,"</Q> &s;aid he, gravely, <Q REND="inline">"that you think me too pre&s;umptuous. I mu&s;t own I had flattered my&s;elf that to &s;often the in|quietude of an ab&s;ence which &s;eems attended by &s;o many inexplicable circum&s;tances, would not have been to incur your di&s;plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s hurt me; and I could not forbear &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Can you indeed de&s;ire, my Lord, that I &s;hould, a &s;econd time, expo&s;e my&s;elf, by an unguarded readine&s;s to write to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A <HI>&s;econd time! unguarded readine&s;s!</HI>"</Q> re|peated he; <Q REND="inline">"you amaze me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Has your Lord&s;hip then quite forgot the fool|i&s;h letter I was &s;o imprudent as to &s;end you when in town?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have not the lea&s;t idea,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"of what you mean."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then, my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"we had better let the &s;ubject drop."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot re&s;t with|out an explanation!"</Q></P>
<P>And then, he obliged me to &s;peak very openly of both the letters; but, my dear Sir, imagine my &s;urpri&s;e, when he a&s;&s;ured me, in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn manner, that far from having ever written me a &s;ingle line, he had never received, &s;een, or heard of my letter!</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="213">
This &s;ubject, which cau&s;ed mutual a&s;toni&s;h|ment and perplexity to us both, entirely engro&s;&s;ed us for the re&s;t of the evening; and he made me promi&s;e to &s;hew him the letter I had received in his name to-morrow morning, that he might en|deavour to di&s;cover the author.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, the conver&s;ation became gene|ral.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Sir, may I not call for your congratulations upon the events of this day? a day never to be recollected by me but with the mo&s;t grateful joy! I know how much you are in|clined to think well of Lord Orville, I cannot, therefore, apprehend that my frankne&s;s to him will di&s;plea&s;e you. Perhaps the time is not very di&s;tant when your Evelina's choice may receive the &s;anction of her be&s;t friend's judgment and approbation,&mdash;which &s;eems now all &s;he has to wi&s;h!</P>
<P>In regard to the change in my &s;ituation which mu&s;t fir&s;t take place, &s;urely I cannot be blamed for what has pa&s;&s;ed! the partiality of Lord Or|ville mu&s;t not only reflect honour upon me, but upon all to whom I do, or may belong.</P>
<P>Adieu, mo&s;t dear Sir. I will write again when I arrive at London.</P>

<P>YOU will &s;ee, my dear Sir, that I was mi&s;ta|ken in &s;uppo&s;ing I &s;hould write no more from this
<PB N="215" REF="214">
place, where my re&s;idence, now, &s;eems more un|certain than ever.</P>
<P>This morning, during breakfa&s;t, Lord Orville took an opportunity to beg me, in a low voice, to allow him a moment's conver&s;ation before I left Clifton; <Q REND="inline">"May I hope,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"that you will &s;troll into the garden after breakfa&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer, but I believe my looks gave no denial; for, indeed, I much wi&s;hed to be &s;a|tisfied concerning the letter. The moment, there|fore, that I could quit the parlour I ran up &s;tairs for my cala&s;h; but before I reached my room, Mrs. Selwyn called after me, <Q REND="inline">"If you are go|ing to walk, Mi&s;s Anville, be &s;o good as to bid Jenny bring down my hat, and I'll accompany you."</Q></P>
<P>Very much di&s;concerted, I turned into the draw|ing-room, without making any an&s;wer, and there I hoped to wait un&s;een, till &s;he had otherwi&s;e di&s;|po&s;ed of her&s;elf. But, in a few minutes, the door opened, and Sir Clement Willoughby en|tered.</P>
<P>Starting at the &s;ight of him, in ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, I let drop the letter which I had brought for Lord Orville's in&s;pection, and, before I could recover it, Sir Clement, &s;pringing forward, had it in his hand. He was ju&s;t pre&s;enting it to me, and, at the &s;ame time, enquiring after my health, when the &s;ignature caught his eye, and he read aloud <Q REND="inline">"Orville."</Q></P>
<P>I endeavoured, eagerly, to &s;natch it from him, but he would not permit me, and, holding it fa&s;t, in a pa&s;&s;ionate manner exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, Mi&s;s Anville, is it po&s;&s;ible you can value &s;uch a letter as this?"</Q></P>
<P>The que&s;tion &s;urpri&s;ed and confounded me, and I was too much a&s;hamed to an&s;wer him; but
<PB N="216" REF="215">
finding he made an attempt to &s;ecure it, I pre|vented him, and vehemently demanded him to re|turn it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tell me fir&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid he, holding it above my reach, <Q REND="inline">"tell me if you have, &s;ince, received any more letters from the &s;ame per&s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, indeed,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"never!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And will you, al&s;o, &s;weete&s;t of women, promi&s;e that you never <HI>will</HI> receive any more? Say that, and you will make me the happie&s;t of men."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement,"</Q> cried I, greatly confu&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"pray give me the letter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And will you not fir&s;t &s;atisfy my doubts?&mdash;will you not relieve me from the torture of the mo&s;t di&s;tracting &s;u&s;pence?&mdash;tell me but that the dete&s;ted Orville has written to you no more!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement,"</Q> cried I, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"you have no right to make any conditions,&mdash;&s;o pray give me the letter directly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;uch &s;olicitude about this hateful let|ter? can it po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve your eagerne&s;s? tell me, with truth, with &s;incerity tell me; Does it really merit the lea&s;t anxiety?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No matter, Sir,"</Q> cried I, in great perplex|ity, <Q REND="inline">"the letter is mine, and therefore&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t conclude, then,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that the letter de&s;erves your utmo&s;t contempt,&mdash;but that the name of Orville is &s;ufficient to make you prize it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement,"</Q> cried I, colouring, <Q REND="inline">"you are quite&mdash;you are very much&mdash;the letter is not&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"you blu&s;h!&mdash;you &s;tammer!&mdash;Great Heaven! it is then all as I feared!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="216">
<Q REND="inline">"I know not,"</Q> cried I, half frightened, <Q REND="inline">"what you mean; but I be&s;eech you to give me the letter, and to compo&s;e your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The letter,"</Q> cried he, gna&s;hing his teeth, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;hall never &s;ee more. You ought to have burnt it the moment you had read it!"</Q> And, in an in&s;tant, he tore it into a thou&s;and pieces.</P>
<P>Alarmed at a fury &s;o indecently outrageous, I would have run out of the room; but he caught hold of my gown, and cried, <Q REND="inline">"Not yet, not yet mu&s;t you go! I am but half-mad yet, and you mu&s;t &s;tay to fini&s;h your work. Tell me, there|fore, does Orville know your fatal partiality?&mdash;Say <HI>yes,</HI>"</Q> added he, trembling with pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"and I will fly you for ever!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For Heaven's &s;ake, Sir Clement,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"relea&s;e me!&mdash;if you do not, you will force me to call for help."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Call then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"inexorable and mo&s;t unfeeling girl; call, if you plea&s;e, and bid all the world witne&s;s your triumph!&mdash;but could ten worlds obey your call, I would not part from you till you had an&s;wered me. Tell me, then, does Orville know you love him?"</Q></P>
<P>At any other time, an enquiry &s;o gro&s;s would have given me inexpre&s;&s;ible confu&s;ion; but now, the wildne&s;s of his manner terrified me, and I only &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever you wi&s;h to know, Sir Clement, I will tell you another time; but for the pre&s;ent, I entreat you to let me go!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Enough,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand you!&mdash;the art of Orville has prevailed;&mdash;cold, inani|mate, phlegmatic as he is, you have rendered him the mo&s;t envied of men!&mdash;One thing more, and I have done:&mdash;Will he marry you?</Q></P>
<P>What a que&s;tion! my cheeks glowed with in|dignation,
<PB N="218" REF="217">
and I felt too proud to make any an|&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee, I &s;ee how it is,"</Q> cried he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"and I find I am undone for ever!"</Q> Then, letting loo&s;e my gown, he put his hand to his forehead, and walked up and down the room in a ha&s;ty and agitated manner.</P>
<P>Though now at liberty to go, I had not the courage to leave him: for his evident di&s;tre&s;s ex|cited all my compa&s;&s;ion. And this was our &s;itua|tion, when Lady Loui&s;a, Mr. Coverley, and Mrs. Beaumont, entered the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Clement Willoughby,"</Q> &s;aid the latter, <Q REND="inline">"I beg pardon for making you wait &s;o long, but&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>She had not time for another word; Sir Cle|ment, too much di&s;ordered to know or care what he did, &s;natched up his hat, and bru&s;hing ha&s;tily pa&s;t her, flew down &s;tairs, and out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And with him went my &s;incere&s;t pity, though I earne&s;tly hope I &s;hall &s;ee him no more. But what, my dear Sir, am I to conclude from his &s;trange &s;peeches concerning the letter? does it not &s;eem as if he was him&s;elf the author of it? How el&s;e &s;hould he be &s;o well acquainted with the contempt it me|rits? Neither do I know another human being who could &s;erve any intere&s;t by &s;uch a deception. I remember too, that ju&s;t as I had given my own letter to the maid, Sir Clement came into the &s;hop; probably he prevailed upon her, by &s;ome bribery, to give it to him, and afterwards, by the &s;ame means, to deliver to me an an&s;wer of his own writing. Indeed I can in no other manner account for this affair. Oh, Sir Clement, were you not your&s;elf unhappy, I know not how I could pardon an artifice that has cau&s;ed me &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="218">
His abrupt departure occa&s;ioned a kind of gene|ral con&s;ternation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very extraordinary behaviour this!"</Q> cried Mrs. Beaumont.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"the Baronet has a mind to tip us a touch of the heroicks this morning!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I declare,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"I never &s;aw any thing &s;o mon&s;trous in my life! it's quite abominable,&mdash;I fancy the man's mad;&mdash;I'm &s;ure he has given me a &s;hocking fright!"</Q></P>
<P>Soon after, Mrs. Selwyn came up &s;tairs, with Lord Merton. The former, advancing ha&s;tily to me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Anville, have you an alma|nack?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me!&mdash;no, Ma'am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who has one, then?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"I never bought one in my life; it would make me quite melancholy to have &s;uch a time-keeper in my pocket. I would as &s;oon walk all day before an hour-gla&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are in the right,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"not to <HI>watch time,</HI> le&s;t you &s;hould be betrayed, unawares, into reflecting how you employ it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad, Ma'am,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"if Time thought no more of me, than I do of Time, I be|lieve I &s;hould bid defiance, for one while to old|age and wrinkles;&mdash;for deuce take me if ever I think about it at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mr. Coverley,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"why do you think it nece&s;&s;ary to tell me this &s;o often?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Often!"</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"Egad, Madam, I don't know, why I &s;aid it now,&mdash;but I'm &s;ure I can't recollect that I ever owned as much before."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="219">
<Q REND="inline">"Owned it before!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"why, my dear Sir, you own it all day long; for every word, every look, every action proclaims it."</Q></P>
<P>I know not if he under&s;tood the full &s;everity of her &s;atire, but he only turned off with a laugh: and &s;he then applied to Mr. Lovel, and a&s;ked if <HI>he</HI> had an almanack?</P>
<P>Mr. Lovel, who always looks alarmed when &s;he addre&s;&s;es him, with &s;ome he&s;itation, an&s;wer|ed, <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am, I have no manner of antipathy to an almanack,&mdash;none in the lea&s;t, I a&s;&s;ure you;&mdash;I dare &s;ay I have four or five."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Four or five!&mdash;pray may I a&s;k what u&s;e you make of &s;o many?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"U&s;e!&mdash;really, Ma'am, as to that,&mdash;I don't make any particular u&s;e of them,&mdash;but one mu&s;t have them, to tell one the day of the month;&mdash;I'm &s;ure, el&s;e, I &s;hould never keep it in my head."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And does your time pa&s;s &s;o &s;moothly un|marked, that, without an almanack, you could not di&s;tingui&s;h one day from another?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really, Ma'am,"</Q> cried he, colouring, <Q REND="inline">"I don't &s;ee any thing &s;o very particular in having a few almanacks; other people have them, I be|lieve, as well as me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Don't be offended,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I have but made a little digre&s;&s;ion. All I want to know, is the &s;tate of the moon,&mdash;for if it is at the <HI>full</HI> I &s;hall be &s;aved a world of conjectures, and know at once to what cau&s;e to attribute the incon&s;i&s;ten|cies I have witne&s;&s;ed this morning. In the fir&s;t place, I heard Lord Orville excu&s;e him&s;elf from going out, becau&s;e he had bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to tran&s;act at home,&mdash;yet have I &s;een him &s;aunter|ing alone in the garden this half-hour. Mi&s;s An|ville, on the other hand, I invited to walk out
<PB N="221" REF="220">

And, but a few minutes &s;ince, Sir Clement Willoughby, with even more than his u&s;ual politene&s;s, told me he was come to &s;pend the morning here,&mdash;when, ju&s;t now, I met him flying down &s;tairs, as if pur&s;ued by the Fu|ries; and, far from repeating his compliments, or making any excu&s;e, he did not even an&s;wer a que&s;tion I a&s;ked him, but ru&s;hed pa&s;t me, with the rapidity of a thief from a bailiff!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, <Q REND="inline">"I can't think what he meant; &s;uch rudene&s;s from a man of any family is quite incomprehen&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a to Lord Mer|ton, <Q REND="inline">"do you know he did the &s;ame by <HI>me?</HI>&mdash;I was ju&s;t going to a&s;k him what was the matter, but he ran pa&s;t me &s;o quick, that I declare he quite dazzled my eyes.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lady&s;hip,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o well becomes the lilies, that the ro&s;es might blu&s;h to &s;ee them&s;elves &s;o excelled."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mr. Lovel,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"if the ro&s;es &s;hould blu&s;h, how would you find it out?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e they mu&s;t blu&s;h, as the &s;aying is, like a blue dog,&mdash;for they are <HI>red</HI> already."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Prithee, Jack,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton, <Q REND="inline">"don't you pretend to talk about blu&s;hes, that never knew what they were in your life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"if experi|ence alone can ju&s;tify mentioning them, what an admirable treati&s;e upon the &s;ubject may we not expect from your Lord&s;hip!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="221">
<Q REND="inline">"O, pray, Ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;tick to Jack Coverley,&mdash;he's your only man; for my part, I confe&s;s I have a mortal aver&s;ion to argu|ments."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, faith my Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"I think, in general, your Hou&s;e is not much addicted to &s;tudy; we of the lower Hou&s;e have indubitably mo&s;t application; and, if I did not &s;peak before a &s;uperior power,"</Q> (bowing low to Lord Merton) <Q REND="inline">I &s;hould pre&s;ume to add, we have likewi&s;e the mo&s;t able &s;peakers."</Q></P>

<P>Lord Merton, turning upon his heel, a&s;ked Lady Loui&s;a, if &s;he &s;hould <HI>take the air</HI> before dinner?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I don't know;&mdash;I'm afraid it's mon&s;trous hot; be&s;ides,"</Q> (put|ting her hand to her forehead) <Q REND="inline">"I a'n't half well; it's quite horrid to have &s;uch weak nerves&mdash;the lea&s;t thing in the world di&s;compo&s;es me: I declare, that man's oddne&s;s has given me &s;uch a &s;hock,&mdash;I don't know when I &s;hall recover from it.

<P><Q REND="inline">"O, by no means,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"your Lady&s;hip is merely delicate,&mdash;and devil take me if ever I had the lea&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for an amazon."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="222">
<Q REND="inline">"I have the honour to be quite of your Lord|&s;hip's opinion,"</Q> "&s;aid Mr. Lovel, looking ma|liciou&s;ly at Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"for I have an in&s;u|perable aver&s;ion to &s;trength, either of body or mind in a female."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Faith, and &s;o have I,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Coverley; <Q REND="inline">"for egad I'd as &s;oon &s;ee a woman chop wood, as hear her chop logic."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So would every man in his &s;en&s;es,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton; <Q REND="inline">"for a woman wants nothing to recommend her but beauty and good-nature; in every thing el&s;e &s;he is either impertinent or unna|tural.

<P><Q REND="inline">"It has always been agreed,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs Sel|wyn, looking round her with the utmo&s;t con|tempt, <Q REND="inline">"that no man ought to be connected with a woman who&s;e under&s;tanding is &s;uperior to his own.

<P>How many enemies, my dear Sir, does this un|bounded &s;everity excite!

<P>Ju&s;t then, a &s;ervant brought Lady Loui&s;a a note, upon a <HI>waiter,</HI> which is a ceremony always u&s;ed to her Lady&s;hip; and I took the opportunity of this interruption to the conver&s;ation, to &s;teal out of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="223">
I went immediately to the parlour, which I found quite empty; for I did not dare walk in the garden after what Mrs. Selwyn had &s;aid.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, a &s;ervant announced Mr. Macartney, &s;aying, as he entered the room, that he would acquaint Lord Orville he was there.</P>
<P>Mr. Macartney rejoiced much at finding me alone. He told me he had taken the liberty to enquire for Lord Orville, by way of pretext for coming to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I then very eagerly enquired if he had &s;een his father.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"and the ge|nerous compa&s;&s;ion you have &s;hewn made me ha&s;ten to acquaint you, that upon reading my un|happy mother's letter, he did not he&s;itate to ac|knowledge me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Good God,"</Q> cried I, with no little emotion, <Q REND="inline">"how &s;imilar are our circum&s;tances! And did he receive you kindly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could not, Madam, expect that he would: the cruel tran&s;action that obliged me to fly Paris, was too recent in his memory."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And,&mdash;have you &s;een the young lady?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he mournfully, <Q REND="inline">"I was forbid her &s;ight."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Forbid her &s;ight!&mdash;and why?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Partly, perhaps, from prudence,&mdash;and part|ly from the remains of a re&s;entment which will not ea&s;ily &s;ub&s;ide.

<P><PB N="225" REF="224">
<Q REND="inline">"You have, you have a &s;i&s;ter!"</Q> cried I, from an impul&s;e of pity which I could not repre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"a &s;i&s;ter who is mo&s;t warmly intere&s;ted in all your concerns, and who only wants opportunity to ma|nife&s;t her friend&s;hip and regard."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Gracious Heaven!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"what does Mi&s;s Anville mean?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Anville,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"is not my real name; Sir John Belmont is my father,&mdash;he is your's,&mdash;and I am your &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;You &s;ee, therefore, the claim we mutually have to each other's regard; we are not merely bound by the ties of friend|&s;hip, but by tho&s;e of blood.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;o lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"that I know not if I hear right!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have then found a brother,"</Q> cried I, holding out my hand, <Q REND="inline">"and he will not own me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Own you!&mdash;Oh, Madam,"</Q> cried he ac|cepting my offered hand, <Q REND="inline">"is it, indeed, po&s;&s;i|ble <HI>you</HI> can own <HI>me?</HI>&mdash;a poor wretched adven|turer! who &s;o lately had no &s;upport but from your genero&s;ity?&mdash;whom your benevolence &s;natch|ed from utter de&s;truction?&mdash;Can <HI>you,</HI>&mdash;Oh Madam, can you indeed, and without a blu&s;h, conde&s;cend to own &s;uch an outca&s;t for a bro|ther?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, forbear, forbear,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"is this language proper for a &s;i&s;ter? are we not recipro|cally bound to each other?&mdash;Will you not &s;uffer me to expect from <HI>you</HI> all the good offices in your power?&mdash;But tell me, where is our father at pre&s;ent?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="225">
<Q REND="inline">"At the Hotwell, Madam; he arrived there ye&s;terday morning."</Q></P>
<P>I would have proceeded with further que&s;tions, but the entrance of Lord Orville prevented me. The moment he &s;aw us, he &s;tarted, and would have retreated; but, drawing my hand from Mr. Macartney's I begged him to come in.</P>
<P>For a few moments we were all &s;ilent, and, I believe all in equal confu&s;ion. Mr. Macartney, however, recollecting him&s;elf, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I hope your Lord&s;hip will forgive the liberty I have taken in making u&s;e of your name?"</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville, rather coldly, bowed, but &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>Again we were all &s;ilent, and then Mr. Macart|ney took leave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fancy,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, when he was gone, <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;hortened Mr. Macartney's vi&s;it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord, not at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had pre&s;umed,"</Q> &s;aid he, with &s;ome he&s;i|tation, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have &s;een Mi&s;s Anville in the garden;&mdash;but I knew not &s;he was &s;o much better engaged."</Q></P>
<P>Before I could an&s;wer, a &s;ervant came to tell me the chai&s;e was ready, and that Mrs. Selwyn was enquiring for me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will wait on her immediately,"</Q> cried I, and away I was running; but Lord Orville, &s;topping me, &s;aid, with great emotion, <Q REND="inline">"Is it thus, Mi&s;s Anville, you leave me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"how can I help it?&mdash;perhaps, &s;oon, &s;ome better opportunity may offer&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"do you indeed take me for a Stoic? What better opportunity

may I hope for?&mdash;is not the chai&s;e come?&mdash;are you not going? have you even deigned to tell me whither?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My journey, my Lord, will now be de|ferred. Mr. Macartney has brought me intel|ligence which renders it, at pre&s;ent, unnece&s;|&s;ary."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Macartney,"</Q> &s;aid he, gravely, <Q REND="inline">"&s;eems to have great influence,&mdash;yet he is a very young coun&s;ellor."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible, my Lord, Mr. Macartney can give you the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My deare&s;t Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> &s;aid he, taking my hand, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee, and I adore the purity of your mind, &s;uperior as it is to all little arts, and all ap|prehen&s;ions of &s;u&s;picion; and I &s;hould do my&s;elf, as well as you, inju&s;tice, if I were capable of har|bouring the &s;malle&s;t doubts of that goodne&s;s which makes you mine for ever: neverthele&s;s, pardon me, if I own my&s;elf &s;urpri&s;ed,&mdash;nay, alarmed, at the&s;e frequent meetings with &s;o young a man as Mr. Macartney."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried I, eager to clear my&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Macartney is my brother!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your brother! you amaze me!&mdash;What &s;trange my&s;tery, then, makes his relation&s;hip a &s;ecret?"</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, Mrs. Selwyn opened the door. <Q REND="inline">"O, you are here!"</Q> cried &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"Pray is my Lord &s;o kind as to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in <HI>preparing</HI> for your journey,&mdash;or in <HI>retarding</HI> it?"</Q></P>

<P>I then acquainted her with Mr. Macartney's communication.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="227">
She immediately ordered the chai&s;e away, and then took me into her own room, to con&s;ider what &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>A few minutes &s;ufficed to determine her, and &s;he wrote the following note.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir John Belmont, Bart.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Selwyn pre&s;ents her compliments to Sir John Belmont, and, if he is at lei&s;ure, will be glad to wait on him this morning, upon bu&s;ine&s;s of importance.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>She then ordered her man to enquire at the pump room for a direction, and went her&s;elf to Mrs. Beaumont to apologi&s;e for deferring her journey.</P>
<P>An an&s;wer was pre&s;ently returned, that he would be glad to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>She would have had me immediately accom|pany her to the Hotwells; but I entreated her to &s;pare me the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;o abrupt an introduction, and to pave the way for my reception. She con|&s;ented rather reluctantly, and, attended only by her &s;ervant, walked to the Wells.</P>
<P>She was not ab&s;ent two hours, yet &s;o mi&s;erably did time &s;eem to linger, that I thought a thou&s;and accidents had happened, and feared &s;he would ne|ver return. I pa&s;&s;ed the whole time in my own room, for I was too much agitated even to con|ver&s;e with Lord Orville.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant that, from my window, I &s;aw her returning, I flew down &s;tairs, and met her in the garden.</P>
<P>We both walked to the arbour.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="228">
Her looks, in which di&s;appointment and anger were expre&s;&s;ed, pre&s;ently announced to me the failure of her emba&s;&s;y. Finding that &s;he did not &s;peak, I a&s;ked her, in a faultering voice, Whether or not I had a father?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have <HI>not,</HI> my dear!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, ab|ruptly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very well, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid I, with tolerable calmne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"let the chai&s;e, then, be ordered again,&mdash;I will go to Berry Hill,&mdash;and there, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall &s;till find one!"</Q></P>
<P>It was &s;ome time ere &s;he could give, or I could hear, the account of her vi&s;it; and then &s;he related it in a ha&s;ty manner; yet I believe I can recollect every word.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I found Sir John alone. He received me with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s. I did not keep him a moment in &s;u&s;pence as to the purport of my vi&s;it. But I had no &s;ooner made it known, than, with a &s;upercilious &s;mile, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"And have you, Madam, been prevailed upon to revive that ridi|culous old &s;tory?"</Q> Ridiculous, I told him, was a term which he would find no one el&s;e do him the favour to make u&s;e of, in &s;peaking of the horri|ble actions belonging to the <HI>old &s;tory</HI> he made &s;o light of; <Q REND="inline">"actions,"</Q> continued I, <Q REND="inline">"which would dye &s;till deeper the black annals of Nero or Cali|gula."</Q> He attempted in vain to rally, for I pur|&s;ued him with all the &s;everity in my power, and cea&s;ed not painting the enormity of his crime, till I &s;tung him to the quick, and, in a voice of pa&s;&s;ion and impatience, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"No more, Madam,&mdash;this is not a &s;ubject upon which I need a monitor."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Make, then,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"the only reparation in your power.&mdash;Your daughter is now at Clifton; &s;end for her hither, and, in the face of the world, proclaim the legitimacy

of her birth, and clear the reputation of your injured wife."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you are much mi&s;taken, if you &s;uppo&s;e I waited for the honour of this vi&s;it, before I did what little ju&s;|tice now depends upon me, to the memory of that unfortunate woman: her daughter has been my care from her infancy; I have taken her into my hou&s;e; &s;he bears my name, and &s;he will be my &s;ole heire&s;s."</Q> For &s;ome time this a&s;&s;ertion appeared &s;o ab&s;urd, that I only laughed at it; but at la&s;t, he a&s;&s;ured me, I had my&s;elf been im|po&s;ed upon, for that the very woman who at|tended Lady Belmont in her la&s;t illne&s;s conveyed the child to him while he was in London, before &s;he was a year old. <Q REND="inline">"Unwilling,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"at that time to confirm the rumour of my be|ing married, I &s;ent the woman with the child to France; as &s;oon as &s;he was old enough, I put her into a convent, where &s;he has been properly edu|cated; and now I have taken her home, I have acknowledged her for my lawful child, and paid, at length, to the memory of her unhappy mother, a tribute of fame which has made me wi&s;h to hide my&s;elf hereafter from all the world."</Q> This whole &s;tory &s;ounded &s;o improbable, that I did not &s;cruple to tell him I di&s;credited every word. He then rung his bell, and enquiring if his hair|dre&s;&s;er was come, &s;aid he was &s;orry to leave me, but that, if I would favour him with my compa|ny to-morrow, he would do him&s;elf the honour of introducing Mi&s;s Belmont to <HI>me,</HI> in&s;tead of troubling me to introduce her to <HI>him.</HI> I ro&s;e in great indignation, and, a&s;&s;uring him I would make his conduct as public as it was infamous, I left the hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>"Good Heaven, how &s;trange a recital! how incomprehen&s;ible an affair! The Mi&s;s Belmont,
<PB N="231" REF="230">
then, who is actually at Bri&s;tol, pa&s;&s;es for the daughter of my unhappy mother!&mdash;pa&s;&s;es, in &s;hort, for your Evelina! Who &s;he can be or what this tale can mean, I have not any idea.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn &s;oon after left me to my own reflections. Indeed they were not very plea&s;ant. Quietly as I had borne her relation, the mo|ment I was alone I felt mo&s;t bitterly both the di&s;|grace and the &s;orrow of a rejection &s;o cruelly in|explicable.</P>
<P>I know not how long I might have continued in this &s;ituation, had I not been awakened from my melancholy reverie by the voice of Lord Or|ville. <Q REND="inline">"May I come in,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"or &s;hall I interrupt you?"</Q> I was &s;ilent, and he &s;eated him&s;elf next me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fear,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Anville will think I per&s;ecute her; yet &s;o much as I have to &s;ay, and &s;o much as I wi&s;h to hear, with &s;o few opportunities for either, &s;he cannot wonder,&mdash;and I hope &s;he will not be offended,&mdash;that I &s;eize with &s;uch avidity every moment in my power to conver&s;e with her. You are grave,"</Q> added he, taking my hand; <Q REND="inline">"I hope you do not regret the delay of your journey?&mdash;I hope the plea&s;ure it gives to <HI>me,</HI> will not be a &s;ubject of pain to <HI>you?</HI>&mdash;You are &s;ilent?&mdash;Something, I am &s;ure, has afflicted you:&mdash;Would to Heaven I were able to con&s;ole you!&mdash;Would to Heaven I were worthy to participate in your &s;orrows!"</Q></P>
<P>My heart was too full to bear this kindne&s;s, and I could only an&s;wer by my tears. <Q REND="inline">"Good Hea|ven,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"how you alarm me!&mdash;My love, my &s;weet Mi&s;s Anville, deny me no longer to be the &s;harer of your griefs!&mdash;tell me, at lea&s;t, that you have not withdrawn your e&s;teem!&mdash;that you do not repent the goodne&s;s you have &s;hewn

<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, my Lord,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"your genero&s;ity overpowers me!"</Q> And I wept like an infant. For now that all my hopes of being acknowledged &s;eemed finally cru&s;hed, I felt the noblene&s;s of his di&s;intere&s;ted attachment &s;o forcibly, that I could &s;carce breathe under the weight of gratitude that oppre&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed greatly &s;hocked, and in terms the mo&s;t flattering, the mo&s;t re&s;pectfully tender, he at once &s;oothed my di&s;tre&s;s, and urged me to tell him its cau&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid I, when I was able to &s;peak, <Q REND="inline">"you little know what an outca&s;t you have ho|noured with your choice!&mdash;a child of bounty,&mdash;an orphan from infancy,&mdash;dependent, even for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence dependent, upon the kindne&s;s of com|pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;Rejected by my natural friends,&mdash;di&s;|owned for ever by my neare&s;t relation,&mdash;Oh, my Lord, &s;o circum&s;tanced, can I de&s;erve the di&s;|tinction with which you honour me?

<P>I could not proceed; my whole &s;oul recoiled again&s;t the charge I would have given, and my voice refu&s;ed to utter it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never!"</Q> cried he, warmly; <Q REND="inline">"my heart is your's, and I &s;wear to you an attachment eter|nal!&mdash;You prepare me, indeed, for a tale of hor|ror, and I am almo&s;t breathle&s;s with expectation,&mdash;but &s;o firm is my conviction, that, whatever
<PB N="233" REF="232">
are your misfortunes, to have merited them is not of the number, that I feel my&s;elf more &s;trongly, more invincibly attached to you than ever!&mdash;Tell me but where I may find this noble friend, who&s;e virtues you have already taught me to re|verence,&mdash;and I will fly to obtain his con&s;ent and interce&s;&s;ion,&mdash;that henceforward our fates may be indi&s;&s;olubly united,&mdash;and, then &s;hall it be the &s;ole &s;tudy of my life to endeavour to &s;often your pa&s;t,&mdash;and guard you from future misfor|tunes!"</Q></P>
<P>I had ju&s;t rai&s;ed my eyes, to an&s;wer this mo&s;t generous of men, when the fir&s;t object they met was Mrs. Selwyn!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So, my dear,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what, &s;till courting the rural &s;hades!&mdash;I thought, ere now, you would have been &s;atiated with this retired &s;eat, and I have been &s;eeking you all over the Hou&s;e. But I now &s;ee the only way to meet with <HI>you,</HI>&mdash;is to enquire for <HI>Lord Orville.</HI> However, don't let me di&s;turb your meditations; you are po&s;&s;ibly planning &s;ome pa&s;toral dialogue."</Q></P>
<P>And, with this provoking &s;peech, &s;he walked on.</P>
<P>In the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, I was quitting the ar|bour, when Lord Orville &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"permit <HI>me</HI> to follow Mrs. Selwyn;&mdash;it is time to put an end to all impertinent conjectures; will you allow me to &s;peak to her openly?</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ented in &s;ilence; and he left me.</P>
<P>I then went to my own room, where I conti|nued till I was &s;ummoned to dinner; after which, Mrs. Selwyn invited me to her's.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he had &s;hut the door, <Q REND="inline">"Your Lady&s;hip,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"will, I hope, be &s;eat|ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ma'am!"</Q> cried I, &s;taring.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="233">
<Q REND="inline">"O the &s;weet innocent! &s;o you don't know what I mean?&mdash;but, my dear, my &s;ole view is to accu&s;tom you a little to your dignity elect, le&s;t, when you are addre&s;&s;ed by your title, you &s;hould look another way, from an apprehen&s;ion of li&s;tening to a di&s;cour&s;e not meant for you to hear."</Q></P>
<P>Having, in this manner, diverted her&s;elf with my confu&s;ion, till her raillery was almo&s;t exhau&s;t|ed, &s;he congratulated me, very &s;eriou&s;ly, upon the attachment of Lord Orville, and painted to me, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, his di&s;intere&s;ted de&s;ire of being married to me immediately. She had told him, &s;he &s;aid, my whole &s;tory; and yet he was willing, nay eager, that our union &s;hould take place of any further application to my fami|ly. <Q REND="inline">"Now, my dear,"</Q> continued &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I advi&s;e you, by all means, to marry him directly; nothing can be more precarious than our &s;ucce&s;s with Sir John; and the young men of this age are not to be tru&s;ted with too much time for de|liberation, where their intere&s;ts are concern|ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God, Madam,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"do you think I would <HI>hurry</HI> Lord Orville?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, do as you will;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"luckily you have an excellent &s;ubject for Quixoti&s;m;&mdash;otherwi&s;e, this delay might prove your ruin: but Lord Orville is almo&s;t as romantic as if he had been born and bred at Berry Hill."</Q></P>
<P>She then propo&s;ed, as no better expedient &s;eemed likely to be &s;ugge&s;ted, that I &s;hould ac|company her at once, in her vi&s;it to the Hot-wells to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>The very idea made me tremble; yet &s;he re|pre&s;ented &s;o &s;trongly the nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing this unhappy affair with &s;pirit, or giving it totally up,
<PB N="235" REF="234">
that, wanting her force of argument, I was al|mo&s;t obliged to yield to her propo&s;al.</P>
<P>In the evening, we all walked in the garden: and Lord Orville, who never quitted my &s;ide, told me, he had been li&s;tening to a tale, which, though it had removed the perplexities that had &s;o long tormented him, had penetrated him with &s;orrow and compa&s;&s;ion. I acquainted him with Mrs. Selwyn's plan for to-morrow, and confe&s;&s;ed the extreme terror it gave me. He then, in a manner almo&s;t unan&s;werable, be&s;ought me to leave to him the conduct of the affair, by con&s;enting to be his before an interview took place.</P>
<P>I could not but acknowledge my &s;en&s;e of his generou&s;ity; but I told him I was wholly depen|dent upon you, and that I was certain your opi|nion would be the &s;ame as mine, which was, that it would be highly improper I &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf for ever, &s;o very near the time which mu&s;t finally decide by who&s;e authority I ought to be guided. The &s;ubject of this dreaded meeting, with the thou&s;and conjectures and apprehen&s;ions to which it gives birth, employed all our conver|&s;ation then, as it has all my thoughts &s;ince.</P>
<P>Heaven only knows how I &s;hall &s;upport my&s;elf, when the long-expected,&mdash;the wi&s;hed,&mdash;yet ter|rible moment arrives, that will pro&s;trate me at the feet of the neare&s;t, the mo&s;t reverenced of all relations, whom my heart yearns to know, and longs to love!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Clifton, <DATE>Oct. 9.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I COULD not write ye&s;terday, &s;o violent was the agitation of my mind,&mdash;but I will not, now, lo&s;e a moment till I have ha&s;tened to my be&s;t friend an account of the tran&s;actions of a day, I can never recollect without emotion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn determined upon &s;ending no me&s;|&s;age, <Q REND="inline">"Le&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"Sir John, fatigued with the very idea of my reproaches, &s;hould en|deavour to avoid a meeting: all we have to do, is to take him by &s;urprize. He cannot but &s;ee who you are, whether he will do you ju&s;tice or not."</Q></P>
<P>We went early, and in Mrs. Beaumont's chariot; into which, Lord Orville, uttering words of the kinde&s;t encouragement, handed us both.</P>
<P>My unea&s;ine&s;s, during the ride, was exce&s;&s;ive, but, when we &s;topped at the door, I was almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s with terror! the meeting at la&s;t, was not &s;o dreadful as that moment! I believe I was car|ried into the hou&s;e; but I &s;carce recollect what was done with me: however, I know we remain|ed &s;ome time in the parlour, ere Mrs. Selwyn could &s;end any me&s;&s;age up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>When I was &s;omewhat recovered, I entreat|ed her to let me return home, a&s;&s;uring her I felt my&s;elf quite unequal to &s;upporting the in|terview.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="236">
<Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t &s;tay now; your fears will but gain &s;trength by delay, and we mu&s;t not have &s;uch a &s;hock as this repeated."</Q> Then, turning to the &s;ervant, &s;he &s;ent up her name.</P>
<P>An an&s;wer was brought, that he was going out in great ha&s;te, but would attend her immediate|ly. I turned &s;o &s;ick, that Mrs. Selwyn was ap|prehen&s;ive I &s;hould have fainted; and opening a door which led to an inner apartment, &s;he beg|ged me to wait there till I was &s;omewhat com|po&s;ed, and till &s;he had prepared for my recep|tion.</P>
<P>Glad of every moment's reprieve, I willingly agreed to the propo&s;al, and Mrs. Selwyn had but ju&s;t time to &s;hut me in, ere her pre&s;ence was ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The voice of a <HI>father,</HI>&mdash;Oh dear and re|vered name!&mdash;which then, for the fir&s;t time, &s;truck my ears,&mdash;affected me in a manner I cannot de&s;cribe, though it was only employ|ed to give orders to a &s;ervant as he came down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Then, entering the parlour, I heard him &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, madam, I made you wait, but I have an engagement which now calls me away: however, if you have any commands for me, I &s;hall be glad of the honour of your company &s;ome other time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am come, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"to introduce to you your daughter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am infinitely obliged to you,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"but I have ju&s;t had the &s;atisfaction of breakfa&s;ting with her. Ma'am, your mo&s;t obe|dient."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You refu&s;e, then, to &s;ee her?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="237">
<Q REND="inline">"I am much indebted to you, Madam, for this de&s;ire of encrea&s;ing my family, but you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if decline taking advantage of it. I have already a daughter, to whom I owe every thing; and it is not three days &s;ince, that I had the plea&s;ure of di&s;covering a &s;on; how many more &s;ons and daughters may be brought to me, I am yet to learn;&mdash;but I am, already, perfectly well &s;atisfied with the &s;ize of my fa|mily."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Had you a thou&s;and children, Sir John,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, warmly, <Q REND="inline">"this only one, of which Lady Belmont was the mother, ought to be mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed; and, far from avoiding her &s;ight, you &s;hould thank your &s;tars, in humble gratitude, that there vet remains in your power, the &s;malle&s;t opportunity of doing the injured wife you have de&s;troyed, the poor ju&s;tice of acknow|ledging her child!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very unwilling, Madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"to enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point; but you are determined to compel me to &s;peak. There lives not, at this time, the human being who &s;hould talk to <HI>me</HI> of the regret due to the me|mory of that ill-fated woman; no one can feel it &s;o &s;everely as my&s;elf: but let me, neverthele&s;s, a&s;&s;ure you I have already done all that remained in my power to prove the re&s;pect &s;he merited from me; her child I have educated, and owned for my lawful heire&s;s, if, Madam, you can &s;ug|ge&s;t to me any other means by which I may more fully do her ju&s;tice, and more clearly manife&s;t her innocence, name them to me, and though they &s;hould wound my character &s;till deeper, I will per|form them readily."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All this &s;ounds va&s;tly well,"</Q> returned Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"but I mu&s;t own it is rather too enig|matical
<PB N="239" REF="238">
for <HI>my</HI> faculties of comprehen&s;ion. You can, however, have no objection to &s;eeing this young lady?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None in the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come forth, then, my dear,"</Q> cried &s;he, opening the door, <Q REND="inline">"come forth, and &s;ee your father!"</Q> Then, taking my trembling hand, &s;he led me forward. I would have withdrawn it, and retreated, but as he advanced in&s;tantly towards me, I found my&s;elf already before him.</P>
<P>What a moment for your Evelina!&mdash;an invo|luntary &s;cream e&s;caped me, and covering my face with my hands, I &s;unk on the floor.</P>
<P>He had, however, &s;een me fir&s;t; for in a voice &s;carce articulate he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"My God! does Caroline Evelyn &s;till live!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn &s;aid &s;omething, but I could not li&s;ten to her; and, in a few minutes, he added, <Q REND="inline">"Lift up thy head,&mdash;if my &s;ight has not bla&s;ted thee,&mdash;lift up thy head, thou image of my long|lo&s;t Caroline!"</Q></P>
<P>Affected beyond mea&s;ure, I half aro&s;e, and embraced his knees, while yet on my own.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes,"</Q> cried he, looking earne&s;tly in my face, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee, I &s;ee thou art her child! &s;he lives&mdash;&s;he breathes&mdash;&s;he is pre&s;ent to my view!&mdash;Oh God, that &s;he indeed lived!&mdash;Go, child, go,"</Q> added he, wildly &s;tarting, and pu&s;hing me from him, <Q REND="inline">"take her away, Madam,&mdash;I cannot bear to look at her!"</Q> And then, breaking ha&s;tily from me, he ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>Speechle&s;s, motionle&s;s my&s;elf, I attempted not to &s;top him: but Mrs. Selwyn, ha&s;tening after him, caught hold of his arm. <Q REND="inline">"Leave me, Madam,"</Q> cried he, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"and take care of the poor child;&mdash;bid her not think me un|kind,&mdash;tell her I would at this moment plunge a
<PB N="240" REF="239">
dagger in my heart to &s;erve her,&mdash;but &s;he has &s;et my brain on fire, and I can &s;ee her no more!"</Q> Then, with violence almo&s;t frantic, he ran up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Oh Sir, had I not indeed cau&s;e to dread this in|terview?&mdash;an interview &s;o un&s;peakably painful and afflicting to us both! Mrs. Selwyn would have immediately returned to Clifton; but I in|treated her to wait &s;ome time, in the hope that my unhappy father, when his fir&s;t emotion was over, would again bear me in his &s;ight. How|ever, he &s;oon after &s;ent his &s;ervant to enquire how I did, and to tell Mrs. Selwyn he was much indi&s;|po&s;ed, but would hope for the honour of &s;eeing her to-morrow, at any time &s;he would plea&s;e to appoint.</P>
<P>She fixed upon ten o'clock in the morning, and then, with a heavy heart, I got into the chariot. Tho&s;e afflicting words, <HI>I can &s;ee her no more</HI> were never a moment ab&s;ent from my mind.</P>
<P>Yet the &s;ight of Lord Orville, who handed us from the carriage, gave &s;ome relief to the &s;adne&s;s of my thoughts. I could not, however, enter upon the painful &s;ubject, but begging Mrs. Sel|wyn to &s;atisfy him, I went to my own room.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I communicated to the good Mrs. Clinton the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of my affairs, an idea occurred to her, which &s;eemed to clear up all the my&s;tery of my having been &s;o long di&s;owned.</P>
<P>The woman, &s;he &s;ays, who attended my ever|to-be-regretted mother in her la&s;t illne&s;s, and who nur&s;ed me the fir&s;t four months of my life, &s;oon after being di&s;charged from your hou&s;e, left Berry Hill entirely with her baby, who was but &s;ix weeks older than my&s;elf. Mrs. Clinton remem|bers, that her quitting the place appeared, at the time, very extraordinary to the neighbours, but,
<PB N="241" REF="240">
as &s;he was never heard of afterwards, &s;he was, by degrees, quite forgotten.</P>
<P>The moment this was mentioned, it &s;truck Mrs. Selwyn, as well as Mrs. Clinton her&s;elf, that my father had been impo&s;ed upon, and that the nur&s;e who &s;aid &s;he had brought his child to him, had, in fact, carried her own.</P>
<P>The name by which I was known, the &s;ecrecy ob&s;erved in regard to my family, and the retire|ment in which I lived, all con&s;pired to render this &s;cheme, however daring and fraudulent, by no means impracticable, and, in &s;hort, the idea was no &s;ooner &s;tarted, than conviction &s;eemed to fol|low it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn determined immediately to di&s;co|ver the truth or mi&s;take of this conjecture; there|fore, the moment &s;he had dined, &s;he walked to the Hotwells, attended by Mrs. Clinton.</P>
<P>I waited in my room till her return, and then heard the following account of her vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She found my poor father in great agitation. She immediately informed him of the occa&s;ion of her &s;o &s;peedy return, and of her &s;u&s;picions of the woman who had pretended to convey to him his child. Interrupting her with quickne&s;s, he &s;aid he had ju&s;t &s;ent her from his pre&s;ence: that the certainty I carried in my countenance, of my real birth, made him, the moment he had recovered from a &s;urpri&s;e which had almo&s;t deprived him of rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pect, him&s;elf, the impo&s;ition &s;he men|tioned. He had, therefore, &s;ent for the woman, and que&s;tioned her with the utmo&s;t au&s;terity: &s;he turned pale, and was extremely embarra&s;&s;ed, but &s;till &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in affirming, that &s;he had really brought him the daughter of Lady Belmont. His perplexity, he &s;aid, almo&s;t di&s;tracted him; he had <HI>always</HI> ob&s;erved that his daughter bore no re|&s;emblance
<PB N="242" REF="241">
of either of her parents, but, as he had never doubted the veraci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y of the nur&s;e, this cir|cum&s;tance did not give birth to any &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>At Mrs. Selwyn's de&s;ire, the woman was again called, and interrogated with equal art and &s;eve|rity; her confu&s;ion was evident, and her an&s;wers often contradictory, yet &s;he &s;till declared &s;he was no impo&s;tor. <Q REND="inline">"We will &s;ee that in a minute,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, and then de&s;ired Mrs. Clinton might be called up &s;tairs. The poor wretch, changing colour, would have e&s;caped out of the room, but, being prevented, dropt on her knees, and implored forgivene&s;s. A confe&s;&s;ion of the whole affair was then extorted from her.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, my dear Sir, you mu&s;t remember <HI>Dame Green,</HI> who was my fir&s;t nur&s;e? The de|ceit &s;he has practi&s;ed, was &s;ugge&s;ted, &s;he &s;ays, by a conver&s;ation &s;he overheard, in which my un|happy mother be&s;ought you, that, if her child &s;urvived her, you would take the &s;ole care of its education; and, in particular, if it &s;hould be a female, you would by no means part with her early in life. You not only con&s;ented, &s;he &s;ays, but a&s;&s;ured her you would even retire abroad with me your&s;elf, if my father &s;hould importunately demand me. Her own child, &s;he &s;aid, was then in her arms, and &s;he could not forbear wi&s;hing it were po&s;&s;ible to give <HI>her</HI> the fortune which &s;eemed &s;o little valued for me. This wi&s;h once rai&s;ed, was not ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; on the contrary, what at fir&s;t appeared a mere idle de&s;ire, in a &s;hort time &s;eemed a fea&s;ible &s;cheme. Her hu&s;band was dead, and &s;he had little regard for any body but her child; and, in &s;hort, having &s;aved money for the journey, &s;he contrived to enquire a direction to my father, and, telling her neighbours &s;he was
<PB N="243" REF="242">
going to &s;ettle in Devon&s;hire, &s;he &s;et out on her expedition.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Selwyn a&s;ked her, how &s;he dared to perpetrate &s;uch a fraud, &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he had no ill de&s;igns, but that, as <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> would be never the wor&s;e for it, &s;he thought it a pity <HI>nobody</HI> &s;hould be the better.</P>
<P>Her &s;ucce&s;s we are already acquainted with. Indeed every thing &s;eemed to contribute to wards it: my father had no corre&s;pondent at Berry Hill, the child was in&s;tantly &s;ent to France, where be|ing brought up in as much retirement as my&s;elf, nothing but accident could di&s;cover the fraud.</P>
<P>And here, let me indulge my&s;elf in ob&s;erving, and rejoicing to ob&s;erve, that the total neglect I thought I met with, was not the effect of in&s;en&s;i|bility or unkindne&s;s, but of impo&s;ition and error; and that, at the very time we concluded I was unnaturally rejected, my deluded father meant to &s;hew me mo&s;t favour and protection.</P>
<P>He acknowledges that lady Howard's letter flung him into &s;ome perplexity; he immediately communicated it to Dame Green, who confe&s;&s;ed it was the greate&s;t &s;hock &s;he had ever received in her life; yet &s;he had the art and boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert, that Lady Howard mu&s;t her&s;elf have been deceiv|ed: and as &s;he had, from the beginning of her enterprize, declared &s;he had &s;tolen away the child without your knowledge, &s;he concluded that &s;ome deceit was <HI>then</HI> intended him; and this thought occa&s;ioned his abrupt an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Dame Green owned, that from the moment the journey to England was &s;ettled, &s;he gave her&s;elf up for lo&s;t. All her hope was to have had her daughter married before it took place, for which rea&s;on &s;he had &s;o much promoted Mr. Macart|ney's addre&s;&s;es: for though &s;uch a match was in|adequate
<PB N="244" REF="243">
to the preten&s;ions of <HI>Mi&s;s Belmont,</HI> &s;he well knew it was far &s;uperior to tho&s;e <HI>her daughter</HI> could form, after the di&s;covery of her birth.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t enquiry was, if this innocent daughter was yet acquainted with the affair? No, Mrs. Sel|wyn &s;aid, nor was any plan &s;ettled how to divulge it to her. Poor unfortunate girl! how hard is her fate! &s;he is entitled to my kinde&s;t offices, and I &s;hall always con&s;ider her as my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked whether my father would again al|low me to &s;ee him?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, no, my dear, not yet,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"he declares the &s;ight of you is too much for him: however, we are to &s;ettle every thing concerning you to-morrow, for this woman took up all our time to-day."</Q></P>
<P>This morning, therefore, &s;he is again gone to the Hotwells. I am waiting in all impatience for her return; but as I know you will be anxious for the account this letter contains, I will not de|lay &s;ending it.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Arm your&s;elf,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"with all your Berry Hill philo&s;ophy;&mdash;con over every le&s;&s;on of fortitude or re&s;ignation you ever learnt in your life,&mdash;for know,&mdash;you are next week to be married to Lord Orville!"</Q></P>
<P>Doubt, a&s;toni&s;hment, and a kind of perturba|tion I cannot de&s;cribe, made this abrupt commu|nication alarm me extremely, and, almo&s;t breath|le&s;s, I could only exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, Ma|dam, what do you tell me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may well be frightened, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, ironically, <Q REND="inline">"for really there is &s;omething mighty terrific, in becoming, at once, the wife of the man you adore,&mdash;and a Counte&s;s!"</Q></P>
<P>I entreated her to &s;pare her raillery, and tell me her real meaning. She could not prevail with her|&s;elf to grant the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> reque&s;t, though &s;he readily complied with the &s;econd.</P>
<P>My poor father, &s;he &s;aid, was &s;till in the ut|mo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. He entered upon his affairs with great openne&s;s, and told her he was equally di|&s;turbed how to di&s;po&s;e either of the daughter he had di&s;covered, or the daughter he was now to give up: the former he dreaded to tru&s;t him&s;elf with again beholding, and the latter he knew not how to &s;hock with the intelligence of her di&s;|grace. Mrs. Selwyn then acquainted him with my &s;ituation in regard to Lord Orville; this de|lighted him extremely, and, when he heard of his Lord&s;hip's eagerne&s;s, he &s;aid he was him&s;elf of opinion, the &s;ooner the union took place the better: and, in return, he informed her of the af|fair of Mr. Macartney. <Q REND="inline">"And, after a very long
<PB N="246" REF="245">
conver&s;ation,</Q> continued Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"we agreed, that the mo&s;t eligible &s;cheme for all par|ties, would be to have both the real and the ficti|tious daughter married without delay. There|fore, if either of you have any inclination to pull caps for the title of Mi&s;s Belmont, you mu&s;t do it with all &s;peed, as next week will take from both of you all preten&s;ions to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Next week!"&mdash;dear Madam, what a &s;trange plan!&mdash;without my being con&s;ulted&mdash;without ap|plying to Mr. Villars,&mdash;without even the concur|rence of Lord Orville!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to con&s;ulting <HI>you,</HI> my dear, it was out of all que&s;tion, becau&s;e, you know, young ladies hearts and hands are always to be given with re|luctance;&mdash;as to Mr. Villars, it is &s;ufficient we know him for your friend;&mdash;and as for Lord Or|ville, he is a party concerned."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A party concerned!&mdash;you amaze me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, yes; for as I found our con&s;ultation likely to redound to his advantage, I per&s;uaded Sir John to &s;end for him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Send for him!&mdash;Good God!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, and Sir John agreed. I told the &s;er|vant, that if he could not hear of his Lord&s;hip in the hou&s;e, he might be pretty certain of encoun|tering him in the arbour.&mdash;Why do you colour, my dear?&mdash;Well, he was with us in a moment; I introduced him to Sir John, and we proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very, very &s;orry for it!&mdash;Lord Orville mu&s;t, him&s;elf, think this conduct &s;trangely preci|pitate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, my dear, you are mi&s;taken, Lord Or|ville has too much good &s;en&s;e. Every thing was then di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a rational manner. You are to be married privately, tho' not &s;ecretly, and then
<PB N="247" REF="246">
go to one of his Lord&s;hip's country &s;eats: and poor little Mi&s;s Green and your brother, who have no hou&s;e of their own, mu&s;t go to one of Sir John's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But why, my dear Madam, why all this ha&s;te? why may we not be allowed a little longer ti me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could give you a thou&s;and rea&s;ons,"</Q> an|&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but that I am tolerably certain <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> will be more than you can controvert, even with all the logic of genuine coquetry. In the fir&s;t place, you doubtle&s;s wi&s;h to quit the hou&s;e of Mrs. Beaumont,&mdash;to who&s;e, then, can you with &s;uch propriety remove, as to Lord Or|ville's?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely, Madam,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"I am not more de&s;titute now, than when I thought my&s;elf an orphan?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your father, my dear,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is willing to &s;ave the little impo&s;tor as much of the mortification of her di&s;grace as it is in his power: now if you immediately take her place, according to your right, as Mi&s;s Belmont, why not all that either of you can do for her, will prevent her be|ing eternally &s;tigmatized, as the bantling of Dame Green, wa&s;h-woman and wet nur&s;e of Berry Hill, Dor&s;et&s;hire. Now &s;uch a genealogy will not be very flattering, even to Mr. Macartney, who, all|di&s;mal as he is, you will find by no means wanting in pride and &s;elf con&s;equence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For the univer&s;e,"</Q> interrupted I, <Q REND="inline">"I would not be acce&s;&s;ary to the degradation you mention; but, &s;urely, Madam, I may return to Berry Hill."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"for though com|pa&s;&s;ion may make us wi&s;h to &s;ave the poor girl the confu&s;ion of an immediate and public fall, yet ju&s;|tice demands you &s;hould appear, henceforward,
<PB N="248" REF="247">
in no other light than that of Sir John Belmont's daughter. Be&s;ides, between friends, I, who know the world, can &s;ee that half this prodigious delicacy for the little u&s;urper, is the mere re&s;ult of &s;elf-intere&s;t; for while <HI>her</HI> affairs are hu&s;ht up, Sir John's, you know, are kept from being brought further to light. Now the double marriage we have projected, obviates all rational objections. Sir John will give you, immediately, &pound; 30,000; all &s;ettlements, and &s;o forth, will be made for you in the name of Evelina Belmont;&mdash;Mr. Ma|cartney will, at the &s;ame time, take poor Polly Green,&mdash;and yet, at fir&s;t, it will only be generally known, that <HI>a daughter of</HI> Sir <HI>John Belmont</HI>'s is married."</Q></P>
<P>In this manner, though &s;he did not convince me, yet the quickne&s;s of her arguments &s;ilenced and perplexed me. I enquired, however, if I might not be permitted to again &s;ee my father, or whether I mu&s;t regard my&s;elf as bani&s;hed his pre|&s;ence for ever?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"he does not know you; he concludes that you have been brought up to dete&s;t him, and therefore he is rather pre|pared to dread, than to love you."</Q></P>
<P>This an&s;wer made me very unhappy; I wi&s;h|ed, mo&s;t impatiently, to remove his prejudice, and endeavour, by dutiful a&s;&s;iduity, to engage his kindne&s;s, yet knew not how to propo&s;e &s;eeing him, while con&s;cious he wi&s;hed to avoid me.</P>
<P>This evening, as &s;oon as the company was en|gaged with cards, Lord Orville exerted his ut|mo&s;t eloquence to reconcile me to this ha&s;ty plan; but how was I &s;tartled, when he told me that next <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> was the day appointed by my father to be the mo&s;t important of my life!</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="248">
<Q REND="inline">"Next Tue&s;day!</Q> repeated I, quite out of breath, <Q REND="inline">"Oh my Lord!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My &s;weet Evelina,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"the day which will make me the happie&s;t of mortals, would probably appear awful to you, were it to be deferred a twelvemonth: Mrs. Selwyn has, doubtle&s;s, acquainted you with the many motives which, independent of my eagerne&s;s, require it to be &s;peedy; &s;uffer, therefore, its acceleration, and generou&s;ly complete my felicity, by endea|vouring to &s;uffer it without repugnance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my Lord, I would not wilfully rai&s;e objections, nor do I de&s;ire to appear in&s;en&s;ible of the honour of your good opinion;&mdash;but there is &s;omething in this plan, &s;o very ha&s;ty,&mdash;&s;o unrea|&s;onably precipitate,&mdash;be&s;ides, I &s;hall have no time to hear from Berry Hill,&mdash;and believe me, my Lord, I &s;hould be for ever mi&s;erable, were I, in an affair &s;o important, to act without the &s;anction of Mr. Villars' advice."</Q></P>
<P>He offered to wait on you him&s;elf; but I told him I had rather write to you. And then he pro|po&s;ed, that, in&s;tead of my immediately accom|panying him to Lincoln&s;hire, we &s;hould, fir&s;t, pa&s;s a month at <HI>my native Berry Hill.</HI></P>
<P>This was, indeed, a grateful propo&s;al to me, and I li&s;tened to it with undi&s;gui&s;ed plea&s;ure. And,&mdash;in &s;hort, I was obliged to con&s;ent to a com|promi&s;e, in merely deferring the day till Thur&s;|day! He readily undertook to engage my father's concurrence in this little delay, and I be&s;ought him, at the &s;ame time, to make u&s;e of his influ|ence to obtain me a &s;econd interview, and to re|pre&s;ent the deep concern I felt in being thus ba|ni&s;hed his &s;ight.</P>
<P>He would then have &s;poken of <HI>&s;ettlements,</HI> but
<PB N="250" REF="249">
I a&s;&s;ured him, I was almo&s;t ignorant even of the word.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Sir, what is your opinion of the&s;e ha&s;ty proceedings? believe me, I half re|gret the &s;imple facility with which I have &s;uffered my&s;elf to be hurried into compliance, and, &s;hould you &s;tart but the &s;malle&s;t objection, I will yet in|&s;i&s;t upon being allowed more time.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now write a conci&s;e account of the &s;tate of my affairs to Howard Grove, and to Madame Duval.</P>
<P>Adieu, deare&s;t and mo&s;t honoured Sir! every thing, at pre&s;ent, depends upon your &s;ingle deci|&s;ion, to which, though I yield in trembling, I yield implicitly.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>October 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY morning, as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, Lord Orville went to the Hotwells, to wait upon my father with my double petition.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont then, in general terms, propo&s;|ed a walk in the garden. Mrs. Selwyn &s;aid &s;he had letters to write, but Lady Loui&s;a aro&s;e to ac|company her.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome rea&s;on to imagine, from the notice with which her Lady&s;hip had honoured me during breakfa&s;t, that her brother had acquainted her with my pre&s;ent &s;ituation: and her behaviour now confirmed my conjecture; for, when I would have gone up &s;tairs, in&s;tead of &s;uffering me, as
<PB N="251" REF="250">
u&s;ual, to pa&s;s di&s;regarded, &s;he called after me, with an affected &s;urpri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Anville, don't you walk with us?"</Q></P>
<P>There &s;eemed &s;omething &s;o little-minded in this &s;udden change of conduct, that, from an invo|luntary emotion of contempt, I thanked her, with a coldne&s;s like her own, and declined her offer. Yet, ob&s;erving that &s;he blu&s;hed extremely at my refu&s;al, and recollecting &s;he was &s;i&s;ter to Lord Orville, my indignation &s;ub&s;ided, and upon Mrs. Beaumont's repeating the invitation, I accepted it.</P>
<P>Our walk proved extremely dull; Mrs. Beau|mont, who never &s;ays much, was more &s;ilent than u&s;ual; Lady Loui&s;a &s;trove in vain to lay a&s;ide the re&s;traint and di&s;tance &s;he has hitherto pre&s;erv|ed; and as to me, I was too con&s;cious of the cir|cum&s;tances to which I owed their attention, to feel either pride or plea&s;ure from receiving it.</P>
<P>Lord Orville was not long ab&s;ent; he joined us in the garden, with a look of gaiety and good-hu|mour that revived us all. <Q REND="inline">"You are ju&s;t the party,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;hed to &s;ee together. Will you, Madam,"</Q> taking my hand, <Q REND="inline">"allow me the honour of introducing you, by your real name, to two of my neare&s;t relations? Mrs. Beaumont, give me leave to pre&s;ent to you the daughter of Sir John Belmont; a young lady who, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t long &s;ince have engaged your e&s;teem and ad|miration, tho' you were a &s;tranger to her birth."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, graciou&s;ly &s;aluting me, <Q REND="inline">"the young lady's rank in life,&mdash;your Lord&s;h p's recommendation,&mdash;or her own merit, would any one of them have been &s;uffi|cient to have entitled her to my regard; and I hope &s;he has always met with that re&s;pect in my hou&s;e which is &s;o much her due; though, had I been
<PB N="252" REF="251">
&s;ooner made acquainted with her family, I &s;hould, doubtle&s;s, have the better known how to have &s;ecured it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Belmont,"</Q> &s;aid Lord. Orville, <Q REND="inline">"can receive no lu&s;tre from family, whatever &s;he may give to it. Loui&s;a, you will, I am &s;ure, be hap|py to make your&s;elf an intere&s;t in the friend&s;hip of Mi&s;s Belmont, whom I hope &s;hortly,"</Q> ki&s;&s;ing my hand, and joining it with her Lady&s;hip's, <Q REND="inline">"to have the happine&s;s of pre&s;enting to you by yet another name, and by the mo&s;t endearing of all titles."</Q></P>
<P>I believe it would be difficult to &s;ay who&s;e cheeks were, at that moment, of the deepe&s;t dye, Lady Loui&s;a's or my own; for the con&s;cious pride with which &s;he has hitherto &s;lighted me, gave to her an embarra&s;&s;ment which equalled the confu&s;ion that an introduction &s;o unexpected gave to me. She &s;aluted me, however, and, with a faint &s;mile, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf very happy to profit by the honour of Mi&s;s Belmont's acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P>I only court&s;ied, and we walked on; but it was evident, from the little &s;urpri&s;e they expre&s;&s;ed, that they had been already informed of the &s;tate of the affair.</P>
<P>We were, &s;oon after, joined by more compa|ny: and Lord Orville then, in a low voice, took an opportunity to tell me the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it. In the fir&s;t place, Thur&s;day was agreed to; and, in the &s;econd, my father, he &s;aid, was much con|cerned to hear of my unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;ent me his ble&s;|&s;ing, and complied with my reque&s;t of &s;eeing him, with the &s;ame readine&s;s he &s;hould agree to any other I could make. Lord Orville, therefore, &s;ettled that I &s;hould wait upon him in the evening,
<PB N="253" REF="252">
and, at his particular reque&s;t, unaccompanied by Mrs. Selwyn.</P>
<P>This kind me&s;&s;age, and the pro&s;pect of &s;o &s;oon &s;eeing him, gave me &s;en&s;ations of mixed plea&s;ure and pain, which wholly occupied my mind till the time of my going to the Hotwells.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont lent me her chariot, and Lord Orville ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted upon attending me. <Q REND="inline">"If you go alone,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Selwyn will certainly be offended; but, if you allow me to conduct you, tho' &s;he may give the freer &s;cope to her raillery, &s;he cannot po&s;&s;ibly be affronted: and we had much better &s;uffer her laughter, than provoke her &s;atire."</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, I mu&s;t own I had no rea&s;on to regret being &s;o accompanied; for his conver&s;ation &s;up|ported my &s;pirits from drooping, and made the ride &s;eem &s;o &s;hort, that we actually &s;topt at my father's door, ere I knew we had proceeded ten yards.</P>
<P>He handed me from the carriage, and conduct|ed me to the parlour, at the door of which I was met by Mr. Macartney. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, my dear bro|ther,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"how happy am I to &s;ee you here!"</Q></P>
<P>He bowed and thanked me. Lord Orville, then, holding out his hand, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Macart|ney, I hope we &s;hall be better acquainted; I pro|mi&s;e my&s;elf much plea&s;ure from cultivating your friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip does me but too much ho|nour,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Macartney.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But where,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"is my &s;i&s;ter? for &s;o I mu&s;t already call, and always con&s;ider her:&mdash;I am afraid &s;he avoids me;&mdash;you mu&s;t endeavour, my dear brother, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s her in my favour, and reconcile her to owning me."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="253">
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, Madam,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"you are all goodne&s;s and benevolence! but at pre&s;ent, I hope you will excu&s;e her, for I fear &s;he has hardly for|titude &s;ufficient to &s;ee you: in a &s;hort time, per|haps&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In a <HI>very</HI> &s;hort time, then,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Or|ville, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you will your&s;elf introduce her, and that we &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of wi&s;hing you both joy: allow me, my Evelina, to &s;ay <HI>we,</HI> and permit me, in your name, as well as my own, to entreat that the fir&s;t gue&s;ts we &s;hall have the hap|pine&s;s of receiving, may be Mr. and Mrs. Ma|Macartney."</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ervant then came to beg I would walk up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought Lord Orville to accompany me; but he feared the di&s;plea&s;ure of Sir John, who had de&s;ired to &s;ee me alone. He led me, however, to the head of the &s;tairs, and made the kinde&s;t ef|forts to give me courage; but indeed he did not &s;ucceed, for the interview appeared to me in all its terrors, and left me no feeling but apprehen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The moment I reached the landing-place, the drawing-room door was opened, and my father, with a voice of kindne&s;s, called out, <Q REND="inline">"My child, is it you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> cried I, &s;pringing forward, and kneeling at his feet, <Q REND="inline">"it is your child, if you will own her!"</Q></P>
<P>He knelt by my &s;ide, and folding me in his arms, <Q REND="inline">"own thee!"</Q> repeated he, <Q REND="inline">"yes, my poor girl, and Heaven knows with what bitter contrition!"</Q> Then, rai&s;ing both him&s;elf and me, he brought me into the drawing-room, &s;hut the door, and took me to the window, where, look|ing at me with great earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Poor unhap|py
<PB N="255" REF="254">
Caroline!"</Q> cried he, and, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, he bur&s;t into tears. Need I tell you, my dear Sir, how mine flowed at the &s;ight?</P>
<P>I would again have embraced his knees; but, hurrying from me, he flung him&s;elf upon a &s;o|pha, and leaning his face on his arms, &s;eemed, for &s;ome time, ab&s;orbed in bitterne&s;s of grief.</P>
<P>I ventured not to interrupt a &s;orrow I &s;o much re&s;pected, but waited in &s;ilence, and at a di&s;|tance, till he recovered from its violence. But then it &s;eemed, in a moment, to give way to a kind of frantic fury; for, &s;tarting &s;uddenly, with a &s;ternne&s;s which at once &s;urpri&s;ed and frightened me, <Q REND="inline">"Child,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"ha&s;t thou yet &s;uffi|ciently humbled thy father?&mdash;if thou ha&s;t, be contented with this proof of my weakne&s;s, and no longer force thy&s;elf into my pre&s;ence!"</Q></P>
<P>Thunder&s;truck by a command &s;o unexpected, I &s;tood &s;till and &s;peechle&s;s, and doubted whether my own ears did not deceive me:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, go, go!"</Q> cried he, pa&s;&s;ionately, <Q REND="inline">"in pity&mdash;in compa&s;&s;ion,&mdash;if thou value&s;t my &s;en&s;es, leave me,&mdash;and for ever!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will, I will!"</Q> cried I, greatly terrified; and I moved ha&s;tily towards the door: yet &s;top|ping when I reached it, and, almo&s;t involuntarily, dropping on my knees, <Q REND="inline">"Vouch&s;afe,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"oh, Sir, vouch&s;afe but once to ble&s;s your daugh|ter, and her &s;ight &s;hall never more offend you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas,"</Q> cried he, in a &s;oftened voice, <Q REND="inline">"I am not worthy to ble&s;s thee!&mdash;I am not worthy to call thee daughter!&mdash;I am not worthy that the fair light of heaven &s;hould vi&s;it my eyes!&mdash;Oh God! that I could but call back the time ere thou wa&s;t born,&mdash;or el&s;e bury its remembrance in eternal obli|vion!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="255">
<Q REND="inline">"Would to Heaven,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"that the &s;ight of me were le&s;s terrible to you! that, in|&s;tead of irritating, I could &s;oothe your &s;orrows!&mdash;Oh Sir, how thankfully would I then prove my duty, even at the hazard of my life!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;o kind?"</Q> cried he, gently; <Q REND="inline">"come hither, child,&mdash;ri&s;e, Evelina;&mdash;alas, it is for <HI>me</HI> to kneel, not you!&mdash;and I <HI>would</HI> kneel,&mdash;I would crawl upon the earth,&mdash;I would ki&s;s the du&s;t,&mdash;could I, by &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, obtain the forgive|ne&s;s of the repre&s;entative of the mo&s;t injured of women!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, Sir,"</Q> exclaimed I, <Q REND="inline">"that you could but read my heart!&mdash;that you could but &s;ee the fi|lial tenderne&s;s and concern with which it over|flows! you would not then talk thus,&mdash;you would not then bani&s;h me your pre&s;ence, and exclude me from your affection!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"is it then po&s;&s;ible that you do not hate me?&mdash;Can the child of the wronged Caroline look at,&mdash;and not execrate me? Wa&s;t thou not born to abhor, and bred to cur&s;e me? did not thy mother bequeath thee her ble&s;&s;ing, on condition that thou &s;hould&s;t dete&s;t and avoid me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh no, no, no!"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"think not &s;o unkindly of her, nor &s;o hardly of me."</Q> I then took from my pocket-book her la&s;t letter, and, pre&s;&s;ing it to my lips, with a trembling hand, and &s;till upon my knees, I held it out to him.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily &s;natching it from me, <Q REND="inline">"Great Hea|ven!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">'tis her writing!&mdash;Whence comes this?&mdash;who gave it you?&mdash;why had I it not &s;oon|er?"</Q></P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer; his vehemence intimidated me, and I ventured not to move from the &s;uppli|ant po&s;ture in which I had put my&s;elf.</P>

He went from me to the window, where his eyes were for &s;ome time rivetted upon the directi|on of the letter, though his hand &s;hook &s;o vio|lently he could hardly hold it. Then, bringing it to me, <Q REND="inline">"Open it,"</Q>&mdash;cried he,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"for I can|not!"</Q></P>
<P>I had, my&s;elf, hardly &s;trength to obey him; but, when I had, he took it back, and walked ha&s;tily up and down the room, as if dreading to read it. At length, turning to me, <Q REND="inline">"Do you know,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"its contents?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,</Q> an&s;wered I; <Q REND="inline">"it has never been un&s;ealed."</Q></P>
<P>He then again went to the window, and began reading. Having ha&s;tily run it over, he ca&s;t up his eyes with a look of de&s;peration; the letter fell from his hand, and he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"yes! thou art &s;ainted!&mdash;thou art ble&s;&s;ed!&mdash;and I am cur&s;ed for ever!"</Q> He continued &s;ome time fixed in this melancholy po&s;ition; after which, ca&s;ting him|&s;elf with violence upon the ground, <Q REND="inline">"Oh wretch,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"unworthy life and light, in what dungeon can&s;t thou hide thy head?"</Q></P>
<P>I could re&s;train my&s;elf no longer; I ro&s;e and went to him; I did not dare to &s;peak, but with pity and concern unutterable, I wept and hung over him.</P>
<P>Soon after, &s;tarting up, he again &s;eized the letter, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Acknowledge thee, Caro|line!&mdash;yes, with my heart's be&s;t blood would I acknowledge thee!&mdash;Oh that thou could&s;t witne&s;s the agony of my &s;oul!&mdash;Ten thou&s;and daggers could not have wounded me like this letter!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, after again reading it, <Q REND="inline">"Evelina,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he charges me to receive thee;&mdash;wilt thou, in obedience to her will, own for thy fa|ther the de&s;troyer of thy mother?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="257">
What a dreadful que&s;tion! I &s;huddered, but could not &s;peak.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To clear her fame, and receive her child,"</Q> continued he, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the letter, <Q REND="inline">"are the conditions upon which &s;he leaves me her forgivene&s;s: her fame, I have already clear|ed;&mdash;and oh how willingly would I take her child to my bo&s;om,&mdash;fold her to my heart,&mdash;call upon her to mitigate my angui&s;h, and pour the balm of comfort on my wounds, were I not con&s;cious I de&s;erve not to receive it, and that all my affliction is the re&s;ult of my own guilt!"</Q></P>
<P>It was in vain I attempted to &s;peak; hor|ror and grief took from me all power of utte|rance.</P>
<P>He then read aloud from the letter, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Look not like thy unfortunate mother!</HI>&mdash;Sweet &s;oul, with what bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit ha&s;t thou written!&mdash;Come hither, Evelina: Gracious Heaven!"</Q> looking earne&s;tly at me, <Q REND="inline">"never was likene&s;s more &s;triking!&mdash;the eye,&mdash;the face,&mdash;the form,&mdash;Oh my child, my child!"</Q> Imagine, Sir,&mdash;for I can never de&s;cribe my feelings, when I &s;aw him &s;ink upon his knees before me! <Q REND="inline">"Oh dear re|&s;emblance of thy murdered mother!&mdash;Oh all that remains of the mo&s;t-injured of women! be|hold thy father at thy feet!&mdash;bending thus lowly to implore you would not hate him;&mdash;Oh then, thou repre&s;entative of my departed wife, &s;peak to me in her name, and &s;ay that the remor&s;e which tears my &s;oul, tortures me not in vain!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh ri&s;e, ri&s;e, my beloved father,"</Q> cried I, attempting to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot bear to &s;ee you thus;&mdash;rever&s;e not the law of na|ture,

<P><Q REND="inline">"May Heaven ble&s;s thee, my child!&mdash;"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"for <HI>I</HI> dare not."</Q> He then ro&s;e, and embracing me mo&s;t affectionately, added, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee, I &s;ee that thou art all kindne&s;s, &s;oftne&s;s, and tenderne&s;s; I need not have feared thee, thou art all the fonde&s;t father could wi&s;h, and I will try to frame my mind to le&s;s painful &s;en&s;ations at thy &s;ight. Perhaps the time may come when I may know the comfort of &s;uch a daughter,&mdash;at pre&s;ent, I am only fit to be alone: dreadful as are my reflections, they ought merely to torment my|&s;elf.&mdash;Adieu, my child;&mdash;be not angry,&mdash;I cannot &s;tay with thee,&mdash;oh Evelina! thy countenance is a dagger to my heart!&mdash;ju&s;t &s;o, thy mother look|ed,&mdash;ju&s;t &s;o&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Tears and &s;ighs &s;eemed to choak him!&mdash;and waving his hand, he would have left me,&mdash;but, clinging to him, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, Sir,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline">"will you &s;o &s;oon abandon me?&mdash;am I again an orphan?&mdash;oh my dear, my long-lo&s;t father, leave me not, I be&s;eech you! take pity on your child, and rob her not of the parent &s;he &s;o fondly hoped would cheri&s;h her!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know not what you a&s;k,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"the emotions which now rend my &s;oul are more than my rea&s;on can endure: &s;uffer me, then, to leave you,&mdash;impute it not to unkindne&s;s, but think of me as well as thou can&s;t.&mdash;Lord Orville has behaved nobly;&mdash;I believe he will make thee happy."</Q> Then, again embracing me, <Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s thee, my dear child,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s thee, my Evelina!&mdash;endeavour to love,&mdash;at lea&s;t not to hate me,&mdash;and to make me an in|tere&s;t in thy filial bo&s;om by thinking of me as thy father."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="259">
I could not &s;peak; I ki&s;&s;ed his hands on my knees; and then, with yet more emotion, he again ble&s;&s;ed me, and hurried out of the room,&mdash;leaving me almo&s;t drowned in tears.</P>
<P>Oh Sir, all goodne&s;s as you are, how much will you feel for your Evelina, during a &s;cene of &s;uch agitation! I pray Heaven to accept the tribute of his remor&s;e, and re&s;tore him to tranquility!</P>
<P>When I was &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to return to the parlour, I found Lord Orville waiting for me with the utmo&s;t anxiety;&mdash;and then, a new &s;cene of emotion, though of a far different nature, awaited me; for I learnt, by Mr. Macartney, that this noble&s;t of men had in&s;i&s;ted the &s;o-long-&s;up|po&s;ed Mi&s;s Belmont &s;hould be con&s;idered <HI>indeed</HI> as my &s;i&s;ter, and as the co-heire&s;s of my father! though not in <HI>law,</HI> in <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> he &s;ays, &s;he ought ever to be treated as the daughter of Sir John Bel|mont.</P>
<P>Oh Lord Orville!&mdash;it &s;hall be the &s;ole &s;tudy of my happy life, to expre&s;s, better than by words, the &s;en&s;e I have of your exalted benevolence, and greatne&s;s of mind!</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THIS morning, early, I received the follow|ing letter from Sir Clement Willoughby.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="261" REF="260">
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s Anville.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE this moment received intelligence that preparations are actually making for your marriage with Lord Orville.</P>
<P>Imagine not that I write with the imbecile idea of rendering tho&s;e preparations abortive. No, I am not &s;o mad. My &s;ole view is to explain the motive of my conduct in a particular in&s;tance, and to obviate the accu&s;ation of treachery which may be laid to my charge.</P>
<P>My unguarded behaviour when I la&s;t &s;aw you, has, probably, already acquainted you, that the letter I then &s;aw you reading was written by my|&s;elf. For your further &s;atisfaction, let me have the honour of informing you, thatt the one you had de&s;igned for Lord Orville, had fallen into my hands.</P>
<P>However I may have been urged on by a pa&s;&s;i|on the mo&s;t violent that ever warmed the heart of man, I can by no means calmly &s;ubmit to be &s;tig|mati&s;ed for an action &s;eemingly &s;o di&s;honourable; and it is for this rea&s;on that I trouble you with my ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Lord Orville,&mdash;the happy Orville, whom you are &s;o ready to ble&s;s,&mdash;had made me believe he loved you not,&mdash;nay, that he held you in con|tempt.</P>
<P>Such were my thoughts of his &s;entiments of you, when I got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the letter you meant to &s;end him; I pretend not to vindicate either the means I u&s;ed to obtain it, or the action of break|ing the &s;eal;&mdash;but I was impelled by an impetuous
<PB N="262" REF="261">
curio&s;ity to di&s;cover the terms upon which you wrote to him.</P>
<P>The letter, however, was wholly unintelligible to me, and the peru&s;al of it only added to my perplexity.</P>
<P>A tame &s;u&s;pence I was not born to endure, and I determined to clear my doubts at all hazards and events.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered it, therefore, in Orville's name.</P>
<P>The views which I am now going to acknow|ledge, mu&s;t, infallibly, incur your di&s;plea&s;ure,&mdash;yet I &s;corn all palliation.</P>
<P>Briefly, then,&mdash;I concealed your letter to pre|vent a di&s;covery of your capacity,&mdash;and I wrote you an an&s;wer which I hoped would prevent your wi&s;hing for any other.</P>
<P>I am well aware of everything which can be &s;aid upon this &s;ubject. Lord Orville will, po&s;&s;i|bly, think him&s;elf ill u&s;ed;&mdash;but I am extremely indifferent as to his opinion, nor do I now write by way of offering any apology to him, but merely to make known to your&s;elf the rea&s;ons by which I have been governed.</P>
<P>I intend to &s;et off next week for the Continent. Should his Lord&s;hip have any commands for me in the mean time, I &s;hall be glad to receive them. I &s;ay not this by way of defiance,&mdash;I &s;hould blu&s;h to be &s;u&s;pected of &s;o doing through an indirect channel,&mdash;but &s;imply that, if you &s;hew him this letter, he may know I dare defend, as well as ex|cu&s;e my conduct.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>CLEMENT WILLOUGHBY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>What a &s;trange letter! how proud and how piqued does its writer appear! To what alternate <HI>meanne&s;s</HI> and <HI>ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> do the pa&s;&s;ions lead, when rea&s;on and &s;elf-denial do not oppo&s;e them! Sir
<PB N="263" REF="262">
Clement is con&s;cious he has acted di&s;honourably, yet the &s;ame unbridled vehemence which urged him to gratify a blameable curio&s;ity, will &s;ooner prompt him to ri&s;k his life, than confe&s;s his mi&s;|conduct. The rudene&s;s of his manner of writing to me &s;prings from the &s;ame cau&s;e: the proof he has received of my indifference to him, has &s;tung him to the &s;oul, and he has neither the delicacy nor forbearance to di&s;gui&s;e his di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I determined not to &s;hew this letter to Lord Orville, and thought it mo&s;t prudent to let Sir Clement know I &s;hould not. I therefore wrote the following note.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Clement Willoughby.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter you have been plea&s;ed to addre&s;s to me, is &s;o little calculated to afford Lord Or|ville any &s;atisfaction, that you may depend up|on my carefully keeping it from his &s;ight. I will bear you no re&s;entment for what is pa&s;t; but I mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreat, nay implore, that you will not write again, while in your pre&s;ent frame of mind, by <HI>any</HI> channel, direct or indirect.</P>
<P>I hope you will have much plea&s;ure in your pur|po&s;ed expedition, and I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure you of my good wi&s;hes.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Not knowing by what name to &s;ign, I was ob|liged to &s;end it without any.</P>
<P>The <HI>preparations</HI> which Sir Clement mentions, go on ju&s;t as if your con&s;ent were arrived: it is in
<PB N="264" REF="263">
vain that I expo&s;tulate; Lord Orville &s;ays, &s;hould any objections be rai&s;ed, all &s;hall be given up, but that, as his hopes forbid him to expect any, he mu&s;t proceed as if already a&s;&s;ured of your con|currence.</P>
<P>We have had, this afternoon, a mo&s;t intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, in which we have traced our &s;en|timents of each other from our fir&s;t acquain|tance. I have made him confe&s;s how ill he thought of me, upon my fooli&s;h giddine&s;s at Mrs. Stanley's ball; but he flatters me with a&s;&s;urances, that every &s;ucceeding time he &s;aw me, I appeared to &s;omething le&s;s and le&s;s di&s;advan|tage.</P>
<P>When I expre&s;&s;ed my amazement that he could honour with his choice a girl who &s;eemed &s;o infi|nitely, in <HI>every</HI> re&s;pect, beneath his alliance, he frankly owned, that he had fully intended making more minute enquiries into my family and connec|tions, and particularly concerning <HI>tho&s;e people</HI> he &s;aw with me at Marybone, before he acknow|ledged his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my favour: but the &s;uddenne&s;s of my intended journey, and the un|certainty of &s;eeing me again, put him quite off his guard, and <Q REND="inline">"dive&s;ting him of prudence, left him nothing but love."</Q> The&s;e were his words; and yet, he has repeatedly a&s;&s;ured me, that his par|tiality has known no bounds from the time of my re&s;iding at Clifton.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Mr. Macartney has ju&s;t been with me, on an emba&s;&s;y from my father. He has &s;ent me his kinde&s;t love, and a&s;&s;urances of favour, and de&s;ired to know if I am happy in the pro&s;pect of chang|ing my &s;ituation, and if there is any thing I can

name which he can do for me. And, at the &s;ame time, Mr. Macartney delivered to me a draught on my father's banker for a thou&s;and pounds, which he in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould receive entirely for my own u&s;e, and expend in equipping my&s;elf properly for the new rank of life to which I &s;eem de&s;tined.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I need not &s;ay how much I was pene|trated by this goodne&s;s; I wrote my thanks, and acknowledged, frankly, that if I could &s;ee <HI>him</HI> re&s;tored to tranquility, my heart would be without a wi&s;h.</P>

<P>THE time approaches now, when I hope we &s;hall meet,&mdash;yet I cannot &s;leep,&mdash;great joy is as re&s;tle&s;s as &s;orrow,&mdash;and therefore I will continue my journal.</P>
<P>As I had never had any opportunity of &s;ee|ing Bath, a party was formed la&s;t night for &s;hewing me that celebrated city; and this morn|ing, after breakfa&s;t, we &s;et out in three pha|etons. Lady Loui&s;a and Mrs. Beaumont, with Lord Merton; Mr. Coverly with Mr. Lo|vel; and Mrs. Selwyn and my&s;elf, with Lord Orville.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="265">
We had hardly proceeded half a mile, when a gentleman in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, which came gal|loping after us, called out to the &s;ervants, <Q REND="inline">"Hol|la, my Lads,&mdash;pray is one Mi&s;s Anville in any of them <HI>thing-embobs?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I immediately recollected the voice of Cap|tain Mirvan, and Lord Orville &s;topt the pha|eton. He was out of the chai&s;e, and with us in a moment. <Q REND="inline">"So, Mi&s;s Anville,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"how do you do? So I hear you're Mi&s;s Bel|mont now;&mdash;pray how does old Madame French do?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Madame Duval,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"is, I believe, very well."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;he's in <HI>good ca&s;e,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid he, wink|ing &s;ignificantly, <Q REND="inline">"and won't flinch at &s;eeing &s;ervice: &s;he has laid by long enough to refit and be made tight. And pray how does poor Mon&s;ieur Doleful do? is he as lank-jawed as ever?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They are neither of them,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"at Bri&s;tol."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;But &s;urely the old dowager intends coming to the wedding! 'twill be a mo&s;t ex|cellent opportunity to &s;hew off her be&s;t Lyons' &s;ilk. Be&s;ides, I purpo&s;e to dance a new-fa|&s;hioned jig with her. Don't you know when &s;he'll come?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have no rea&s;on, Sir, to expect her at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;'Fore George this here's the wor&s;t news I'd wi&s;h to hear!&mdash;why, I've thought of nothing all the way but what trick I &s;hould &s;erve her!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have been very obliging!"</Q> &s;aid I, laughing.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="266">
<Q REND="inline">"O, I promi&s;e you,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"our Moll would never have wheedled me into this jaunt, if I'd known &s;he was not here; for, to let you into the &s;ecret, I fully intended to have treated the old buck with another frolic."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did Mi&s;s Mirvan, then, per&s;uade you to this journey?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, and we've been travelling all night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>We!</HI>"</Q> cried I:" <Q REND="inline">"Is Mi&s;s Mirvan, then, with you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, Molly?&mdash;yes, &s;he's in that there chai&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God, Sir, why did not you tell me &s;ooner?"</Q> cried I; and immediately, with Lord Orville's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I jumpt out of the phaeton, and ran to the dear girl. Lord Orville opened the chai&s;e-door, and I am &s;ure I need not tell you what unfeigned joy accompanied our meeting.</P>
<P>We both begged we might not be parted during the ride, and Lord Orville was &s;o good as to invite Captain Mirvan into his phae|ton.</P>
<P>I think I was hardly ever more rejoiced than at this &s;o &s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it from my dear Maria; who had no &s;ooner heard the &s;ituation of my affairs, than, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lady Howard and her kind mother, &s;he be&s;ought her father with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s to con&s;ent to the journey, that he had not been able to with&s;tand their united en|treaties; though &s;he owned that, had he not ex|pected to have met with Madame Duval, &s;he be|lieves he would not &s;o readily have yielded. They arrived at Mrs. Beaumont's but a few minutes af|ter we were out of &s;ight, and overtook us without much difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="267">
I &s;ay nothing of our conver&s;ation, becau&s;e you may &s;o well &s;uppo&s;e both the &s;ubjects we cho&s;e, and our manner of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>We all &s;topped at a great hotel, where we were obliged to enquire for a room, as Lady Loui&s;a, <HI>fatigued to death,</HI> de&s;ired to <HI>take &s;omething</HI> before we began our rambles.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the party was a&s;&s;embled, the Cap|tain, abruptly &s;aluting me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"So, Mi&s;s Bel|mont, I wi&s;h you joy; &s;o I hear you've quarrelled with your new name already?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me!&mdash;no, indeed, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then plea&s;e for to tell me the rea&s;on you're in &s;uch a hurry to change it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Belmont!"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, looking round him with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, <Q REND="inline">"I beg pardon,&mdash;but, if it is not impertinent,&mdash;I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ay, I always under&s;tood that Lady's name was Anville."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Fore George,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"it runs in my head, I've &s;een you &s;omewhere before! and now I think on't, pray a'n't you the per&s;on I &s;aw at the play one night, and who did n't know, all the time, whether it was a tragedy or a come|dy, or a concert of fidlers?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, &s;tammering, <Q REND="inline">"I had once,&mdash;I think&mdash;the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you la&s;t &s;pring."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, and if I live an hundred &s;prings,"</Q> an|&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall never forget it; by Jingo, it has &s;erved me for a mo&s;t excellent good joke ever &s;ince. Well, however, I'm glad to &s;ee you &s;till in the land of the living,"</Q> &s;haking him roughly by the hand; <Q REND="inline">"pray, if a body may be &s;o bold, how much a night may you give at pre&s;ent to keep the undertakers aloof?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="268">
<Q REND="inline">"Me, Sir!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, very much di&s;|compo&s;ed; <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t I never thought my&s;elf in &s;uch imminent danger as to&mdash;really, Sir, I don't under&s;tand you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you don't!&mdash;why then I'll make free for to explain my&s;elf. Gentlemen and Ladies, I'll tell you what; do you know this here gentleman, &s;imple as he &s;its there, pays five &s;hillings a night to let his friends know he's alive!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And very cheap too,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"if we con&s;ider the value of the intelli|gence."</Q></P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a, being now refre&s;hed, we proceed|ed upon our expedition.</P>
<P>The charming city of Bath an&s;wered all my ex|pectations. The Cre&s;cent, the pro&s;pect from it, and the elegant &s;ymmetry of the Circus, delighted me. The Parades, I own, rather di&s;appointed me; one of them is &s;carce preferable to &s;ome of the be&s;t paved &s;treets in London, and the other, though it affords a beautiful pro&s;pect, a charming view of Prior Park and of the Avon, yet wanted &s;omething in <HI>it&s;elf</HI> of more &s;triking elegance than a mere broad pavement, to &s;atisfy the ideas I had formed of it.</P>
<P>At the pump-room, I was amazed at the pub|lic exhibition of the ladies in the bath: it is true, their heads are covered with bonnets, but the very idea of being &s;een, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, by whoever plea&s;es to look, is indelicate.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Fore George,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, look|ing into the bath, <Q REND="inline">"this would be a mo&s;t ex|cellent place for old Madame French to dance a fandango in! By Jingo, I would n't wi&s;h for better &s;port than to &s;wing her round this here pond!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="269">
<Q REND="inline">"She would be very much obliged to you,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;o extraordinary a mark of your favour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, to let you know,"</Q> an&s;wered the Cap|tain, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he hit my fancy mightily; I never took &s;o much to an old tabby before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really, now,"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, looking al&s;o into the bath, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is, to me, very incomprehen&s;ible why the ladies chu&s;e that frightful unbecoming dre&s;s to bathe in! I have of|ten pondered very &s;eriou&s;ly upon the &s;ubject, but could never hit upon the rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, I declare,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould like of all things to &s;et &s;omething new a going; I always hated bathing, becau&s;e one can get no pretty dre&s;s for it; now do, there's a good creature, try to help me to &s;omething."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who? me!&mdash;O dear Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;impering, <Q REND="inline">"I can't pretend to a&s;&s;i&s;t a per&s;on of your Lady&s;hip's ta&s;te; be&s;ides, I have not the lea&s;t head for fa&s;hions,&mdash;I really don't think I ever invented three in my life!&mdash;but I never had the lea&s;t turn for dre&s;s,&mdash;never any notion of fancy or elegance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O fie, Mr. Lovel! how can you talk &s;o?&mdash;don't we all know that you lead the <HI>ton</HI> in the <HI>beau monde?</HI>&mdash;I declare, I think you dre&s;s better than any body."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O dear Ma'am, you confu&s;e me to the la&s;t degree! <HI>I</HI> dre&s;s well!&mdash;I prote&s;t I don't think I'm ever fit to be &s;een!&mdash;I'm often &s;hocked to death to think what a figure I go. If your Lady&s;hip will believe me, I was full half an hour this morning thinking what I &s;hould put on!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Odds my life,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h I'd been near you! I warrant I'd have quickened
<PB N="271" REF="270">
your motions a little! Half an hour thinking what you'd put on? and who the deuce, do you think, cares the &s;nuff of a candle whether you've any thing on or not?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pray, Captain,"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"don't be angry with the gentleman for <HI>think|ing,</HI> whatever be the cau&s;e, for, I a&s;&s;ure you, he makes no common practice of offending in that way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really, Ma'am, you are prodigiou&s;ly kind!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, angrily.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, now,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"did you ever get a ducking in that there place your|&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A ducking, Sir!"</Q> repeated Mr. Lovel; <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t I think that's rather an odd term!&mdash;but if you mean a <HI>bathing,</HI> it is an honour I have had many times."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray, if a body may be &s;o bold, what do you do with that frizle-frize top of your own? Why, I'll lay you what you will, there is fat and grea&s;e enough on your crown, to buoy you up, if you were to go in head down|wards."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And I don't know,"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"but that might be the ea&s;ie&s;t way, for I'm &s;ure it would be the lighte&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For the matter of that there,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t make him a &s;oldier, be|fore you can tell which is the lighte&s;t, head or heels. How&s;omever, I'd lay ten pounds to a &s;hilling, I could whi&s;k him &s;o dexterou&s;ly over into the pool, that he &s;hould light plump upon his foretop, and turn round like a tetotum."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Done!"</Q> cried Lord Merton: <Q REND="inline">"I take your odds!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="271">
<Q REND="inline">"Will you?"</Q> returned he; <Q REND="inline">"why then, 'fore George, I'd do it, as &s;oon as &s;ay Jack Ro|bin&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He, he!"</Q> faintly laughed Mr. Lovel, as he moved abruptly from the window, <Q REND="inline">"'pon ho|nour, this is plea&s;ant enough; but I don't &s;ee what right any body has to lay wagers about one, without one's con&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There, Lovel, you are out;"</Q> cried Mr. Coverly; <Q REND="inline">"any man may lay what wager about you he plea&s;es; your con&s;ent is nothing to the purpo&s;e: he may lay that your no&s;e is a &s;ky-blue, if he plea&s;es."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">"or that your mind is more adorned than your per&s;on;&mdash;or any ab|&s;urdity what&s;oever."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, angrily, <Q REND="inline">"I think it's a very di&s;agreeable privilege, and I mu&s;t beg that nobody may take &s;uch a liberty with <HI>me.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Like enough you may,"</Q> cried the Cap|tain; <Q REND="inline">"but what's that to the purpo&s;e? &s;up|po&s;e I've a mind to lay that you've never a tooth in your head?&mdash;pray how will you hinder me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You'll allow me, at lea&s;t, Sir, to take the liberty of a&s;king how you'll <HI>prove</HI> it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How!&mdash;why, by knocking them all down your throat."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Knocking them all down my throat, Sir!"</Q> repeated Mr. Lovel, with a look of horror, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t I never heard any thing &s;o &s;hocking in my life; and I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that no wager, in my opinion, could ju&s;tify &s;uch a bar|barous action."</Q></P>
<P>Here Lord Orville interfered, and hurried us to our carriages.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="272">
We returned in the &s;ame order we came.&mdash;Mrs. Beaumont invited all the party to dinner, and has been &s;o obliging as to beg Mi&s;s Mirvan may continue at her hou&s;e during her &s;tay. The Captain will lodge at the Wells.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t half-hour after our return, was de|voted to hearing Mr. Lovel's apologies for dining in his riding-dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont then, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Mi&s;s Mirvan and me, enquired how we liked Bath?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"the Ladies do not call this &s;eeing Bath."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No!&mdash;what &s;hould ail 'em?"</Q> cried the Cap|tain; <Q REND="inline">"do you &s;uppo&s;e they put their eyes in their pockets?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; but I fancy you will find no per|&s;on,&mdash;that is, no per&s;on of any condition,&mdash;call going about a few places in a morning&mdash;<HI>&s;eeing Bath.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mayhap, then,"</Q> &s;aid the literal Captain, <Q REND="inline">"you think we &s;hould &s;ee it better by going about at midnight?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, no,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, with a &s;u|percilious &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"I perceive you don't under|&s;tand me,&mdash;<HI>we</HI> &s;hould never call it <HI>&s;eeing Bath,</HI> without going at the right &s;ea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, what a plague, then,"</Q> demanded he, <Q REND="inline">"can you only &s;ee at one &s;ea&s;on of the year?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Lovel again &s;miled; but &s;eemed &s;uperior to making any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Bath amu&s;ements,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"have a &s;amene&s;s in them, which, after a &s;hort time, renders them rather in&s;ipid: but the greate&s;t objection that can be made to the place, is the encouragement it gives to game&s;ters."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="273">
<Q REND="inline">"Why I hope, my Lord, you would not think of aboli&s;hing <HI>gaming,</HI>"</Q> cried Lord Merton; <Q REND="inline">"'tis the very <HI>ze&s;t</HI> of life? Devil take me if I could live without it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry for it,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, grave|ly, and looking at Lady Loui&s;a.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip is no judge of this &s;ubject,"</Q> continued the other:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"but if once we could get you to a gaming-table, you'd never be happy away from it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, my Lord,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"that nobody <HI>here</HI> ever occa&s;ions <HI>your</HI> quitting it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your Lady&s;hip,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton, recol|lecting him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"has power to make me quit any thing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Except <HI>her&s;elf,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Coverley. <Q REND="inline">"Egad, my Lord, I think I've helpt you out there."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You men of wit, Jack,"</Q> an&s;wered his Lord|&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"are always ready;&mdash;for my part, I don't pretend to any talents that way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really, my Lord?"</Q> a&s;ked the &s;arca&s;tic Mrs. Selwyn; <Q REND="inline">"well, that is wonderful, con&s;idering &s;ucce&s;s would be &s;o much in your power."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel to Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"has your Lady&s;hip heard the news?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"News!&mdash;what news?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, the report circulating at the Wells concerning a certain per&s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord, no; pray tell me what it is!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no, Ma'am, I beg your La'&s;hip will ex|cu&s;e me; 'tis a profound &s;ecret, and I would not have mentioned it, if I had not thought you knew it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, now, how can you be &s;o mon&s;trous?&mdash;I declare, now, you're a provoking creature!

But come, I know you'll tell me;&mdash;won't you now?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your La'&s;hip knows I am but too happy to obey you; but, 'pon honour, I can't &s;peak a word, if you won't all promi&s;e me the mo&s;t inviola|ble &s;ecrecy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h you'd wait for that from me,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"and I'll give you my word you'd be dumb for one while.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Such a thing as me, Sir!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, letting fall his knife and fork, and looking very important: <Q REND="inline">"I really have not the honour to under&s;tand your expre&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It's all one for that,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"you may have it explained whenever you like it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Pon honour, Sir,"</Q> returned Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t take the liberty to tell you, that I &s;hould be extremely offended, but that I &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;ome &s;ea-phra&s;e, and therefore I'll let it pa&s;s with|out further notice."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orville then, to change the di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;ked Mi&s;s Mirvan if &s;he &s;hould &s;pend the en&s;uing winter in London?"</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, to be &s;ure,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hould &s;he for? &s;he &s;aw all that was to be &s;een before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is London, then,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel &s;miling, at Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"only to be regarded as a <HI>&s;ight?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why pray, Mr. Wi&s;eacre, how are you plea&s;ed for to regard it your&s;elf?&mdash;An&s;wer me to that?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="275">
<Q REND="inline">"O Sir, <HI>my</HI> opinion I fancy you would hardly find intelligible. I don't under&s;tand <HI>&s;ea-phra&s;es</HI> enough to define it to your comprehen&s;ion. Does n't your La'&s;hip think the ta&s;k would be rather difficult?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lard, yes,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"I de|clare I'd as &s;oon teach my parrot to talk Welch."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha! ha! ha! admirable!&mdash;Pon honour, your La'&s;hip's quite in luck to day;&mdash;but that, indeed, your La'&s;hip is every day. Though, to be &s;ure, it is but candid to acknowledge, that the gentlemen of the ocean have a &s;et of ideas, as well as a dialect, &s;o oppo&s;ite to <HI>ours,</HI> that it is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>they</HI> &s;hould regard London as a mere <HI>&s;how,</HI> that may be &s;een by being <HI>looked at.</HI> Ha! ha! ha!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha! ha!</Q> echoed Lady Loui&s;a: <Q REND="inline">Well, I de|clare you are the drolle&s;t creature!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He! he! 'pon honour I can't help laughing at the conceit of <HI>&s;eeing London</HI> in a few weeks!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what a plague &s;hould hinder you?"</Q> cri|ed the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"do you want to &s;pend a day in every &s;treet?"</Q></P>
<P>Here again Lady Loui&s;a and Mr. Lovel inter|changed &s;miles.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, I warrant you, if I had the &s;hewing of it, I'd haul you from St. James's to Wapping the very fir&s;t morning."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;miles were now, with added contempt, repeated; which the Captain ob&s;erving, looked very fiercely at Mr. Lovel, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Hark'ee, my &s;park, none of your grinning!&mdash;'tis a lingo I don't under&s;tand; and if you give me any more of it, I &s;hall go near to lend you a box o' the ear."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, turning ex|tremely pale, <Q REND="inline">"I think it's taking a very particular
<PB N="277" REF="276">
liberty with a per&s;on, to talk to one in &s;uch a &s;tyle as this!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It's like you may,"</Q> returned the Captain; <Q REND="inline">"but give a good gulp and I warrant you'll &s;wal|low it."</Q> Then, calling for a gla&s;s of ale, with a very provoking and &s;ignificant nod, he drank to his ea&s;y dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovel made no an&s;wer, but looked ex|tremely &s;ullen: and &s;oon after, we left the gen|tlemen to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I had then two letters delivered to me; one from Lady Howard and Mrs. Mirvan, which con|tained the kinde&s;t congratulations; and the other from Madame Duval,&mdash;but not a word from <HI>you,</HI>&mdash;to my no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e and concern.</P>
<P>Madame Duval &s;eems greatly rejoiced at my late intelligence: a violent cold, &s;he &s;ays, pre|vented her coming to Bri&s;tol. The Branghtons, &s;he tells me, are all well; Mi&s;s Polly is &s;oon to be married to Mr. Brown, but Mr. Smith has changed his lodgings, <Q REND="inline">"which,"</Q> &s;he adds, <Q REND="inline">"has made the hou&s;e extremely dull. However, that's not the wor&s;e news; <HI>pardie,</HI> I wi&s;h it was! but I've been u&s;ed like nobody,&mdash;for Mon&s;ieur Du Bois has had the ba&s;ene&s;s to go back to France with|out me."</Q> In conclu&s;ion, &s;he a&s;&s;ures me, as you progno&s;ticated &s;he would, that I &s;hall be &s;ole heire&s;s of all &s;he is worth, when Lady Orville.</P>
<P>At tea-time, we were joined by all the gentle|men but Captain Mirvan, who went to the Ho|tel where he was to &s;leep, and made his daughter accompany him, to &s;eparate her <HI>trumpery,</HI> as he called it, from his cloaths.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, Mr. Lovel, who &s;till appeared extremely &s;ulky, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t, I never &s;aw &s;uch a vulgar, abu&s;ive fellow in my life, as that Captain: 'pon honour, I believe he
<PB N="278" REF="277">
came here for no purpo&s;e in the world but to pick a quarrel; however, for my part, I vow I won't humour him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I declare,"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"he put me in a mon&s;trous fright,&mdash;I never heard any body talk &s;o &s;hocking in my life!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, with great &s;o|lemnity, <Q REND="inline">"he threatened to box your ears, Mr. Lovel,&mdash;did not he?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, colour|ing, <Q REND="inline">"if one was to mind every thing tho&s;e low kind of people &s;ay,&mdash;one &s;hould never be at re&s;t for one impertinence or other,&mdash;&s;o I think the be&s;t way is to be above taking any notice of them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, with the &s;ame gravity, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;o receive the blow in &s;ilence!"</Q></P>
<P>During this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;aw the Captain's chai&s;e drive up to the gate, and ran down &s;tairs to meet Maria. She was alone, and told me, that her father, who, &s;he was &s;ure, had &s;ome &s;cheme in agitation again&s;t Mr. Lovel, had &s;ent her on before him. We continued in the garden till his return, and were joined by Lord Orville, who begged me not to in&s;i&s;t on a patience &s;o unnatu|ral, as &s;ubmitting to be excluded our &s;ociety. And let me, my dear Sir, with a grateful heart, let me own, I never before pa&s;&s;ed half an hour in &s;uch perfect felicity.</P>
<P>I believe we were all &s;orry when we &s;aw the Captain return; yet his inward &s;atisfaction, from however different a cau&s;e, did not &s;eem inferior to what ours had been. He chucked Maria un|der the chin, rubbed his hands, and was &s;carce able to contain the fullne&s;s of his glee. We all attended him to the drawing-room, where, hav|ing compo&s;ed his countenance, without any pre|vious
<PB N="279" REF="278">
attention to Mrs. Beaumont, he marched up to Mr. Lovel, and abruptly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray have you ever a brother in the&s;e here parts?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Me, Sir?&mdash;no, thank Heaven, I'm free from all incumbrances of that &s;ort."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"I met a per&s;on ju&s;t now, &s;o like you, I could have &s;worn he had been your twin-brother."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It would have been a mo&s;t &s;ingular plea&s;ure to me,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"if I al&s;o could have &s;een him; for, really, I have not the lea&s;t notion what &s;ort of a per&s;on I am, and I have a prodigi|ous curio&s;ity to know."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, the Captain's &s;ervant opening the door, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"A little gentleman below de&s;ires to &s;ee one Mr. Lovel."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Beg him to walk up &s;tairs,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beau|mont. <Q REND="inline">"But pray what is the rea&s;on William is out of the way?"</Q></P>
<P>The man &s;hut the door without any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can't imagine who it is,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel; <Q REND="inline">"I recollect no little Gentleman of my acquaint|ance now at Bri&s;tol,&mdash;except, indeed, the Mar|quis of Carlton,&mdash;but I don't much fancy it can be him. Let me &s;ee, who el&s;e is there &s;o very little?"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>A confu&s;ed noi&s;e among the &s;ervants now drew all eyes towards the door; the impatient Captain ha&s;tened to open it, and then, clapping his hands, called out, <Q REND="inline">"'Fore George, 'tis the &s;ame per|&s;on I took for your relation!"</Q></P>
<P>And then, to the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of every body but him&s;elf, he hauled into the room a monkey! full dre&s;&s;ed, and extravagantly <HI>&agrave;-la-mode!</HI></P>
<P>The di&s;may of the company was almo&s;t gene|ral. Poor Mr. Lovel &s;eemed thunder&s;truck with
<PB N="280" REF="279">
indignation and &s;urpri&s;e; Lady Loui&s;a began a &s;cream, which for &s;ome time was ince&s;&s;ant; Mi&s;s Mirvan and I jumped involuntarily upon the &s;eats of our chairs; Mrs. Beaumont her&s;elf followed our example; Lord Orville placed him&s;elf before me as a guard; and Mrs. Selwyn, Lord Merton, and Mr. Coverley, bur&s;t into a loud, immode|rate, ungovernable fit of laughter, in which they were joined by the Captain, till, unable to &s;up|port him&s;elf, he rolled on the floor.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t voice which made its way thro' this general noi&s;e, was that of Lady Loui&s;a, which her fright and &s;creaming rendered extremely &s;hrill. <Q REND="inline">"Take it away!"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"take the mon|&s;ter away,&mdash;I &s;hall faint, I &s;hall faint if you don't!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Lovel, irritated beyond endurance, an|grily demanded of the Captain what he meant?"</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mean?"</Q> cried the Captain, as &s;oon as he was able to &s;peak, <Q REND="inline">"why only to &s;hew you in your proper colours."</Q> Then ri&s;ing, and pointing to the monkey, <Q REND="inline">"Why now, Ladies and Gen|tlemen, I'll be judged by you!&mdash;Did you ever &s;ee any thing more like?

<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, &s;tamping, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall take a time to make you feel my wrath."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, now,"</Q> continued the regardle&s;s Cap|tain, <Q REND="inline">"ju&s;t for the fun's &s;ake, doff your coat and wai&s;tcoat, and &s;wop with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Grinagain</HI> here, and I'll warrant you'll not know your&s;elf which is which."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Who I?"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, almo&s;t mad with vexation, <Q REND="inline">"as I'm a living creature, I would not touch him for a thou&s;and worlds!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Send him a challenge,"</Q> cried Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"and I'll be your &s;econd."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, do,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"and I'll be &s;econd to my friend Mon&s;ieur Clapperclaw here. Come, to it at once!&mdash;tooth and nail!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"God forbid!"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, retreating, <Q REND="inline">"I would &s;ooner tru&s;t my per&s;on with a mad bull!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't like the looks of him my&s;elf,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton, <Q REND="inline">"for he grins mo&s;t horribly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh I'm frightened out of my &s;en&s;es!"</Q> cried Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"take him away, or I &s;hall die!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Captain,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Orville, <Q REND="inline">"the ladies are alarmed, and I mu&s;t beg you would &s;end the monkey away."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, where can be the mighty harm of one monkey more than another?"</Q> an&s;wered the Cap|tain; <Q REND="inline">how&s;omever, if it's agreeable to the ladies, &s;uppo&s;e we turn them out together?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean by that, Sir?"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, lifting up his cane.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What do <HI>you</HI> mean?"</Q> cried the Captain, fiercely: <Q REND="inline">be &s;o good as to down with your cane."</Q></P>
<P>Poor Mr. Lovel, too much intimidated to &s;tand his ground, yet too much enraged to &s;ubmit, turn|ed ha&s;tily round, and, forgetful of con&s;equences, vented his pa&s;&s;ion by giving a furious blow to the monkey.</P>
<P>The creature, darting forwards, &s;prung in&s;tant|ly upon him, and olinging round his neck, fa&s;ten|ed his teeth to one of his ears.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="281">
I was really &s;orry for the poor man, who, though an egregious fop, had committed no of|fence that merited &s;uch cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible, now, to di&s;tingui&s;h who&s;e &s;creams were loude&s;t, tho&s;e of Mr. Lovel or the terrified Lady Loui&s;a, who, I believe, thought her own turn was approaching: but the unrelent|ing Captain roared with joy.</P>
<P>Not &s;o Lord Orville: ever humane, generous, and benevolent, he quitted his charge, whom he &s;aw was wholly out of danger, and &s;eizing the monkey by the collar, made him loo&s;en the ear, and then, with a &s;udden &s;wing, flung him out of the room, and &s;hut the door.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovel was now a dreadful object; his face was be&s;meared with tears, the blood from his ear ran trickling down his cloaths, and he &s;unk upon the floor, crying out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh I &s;hall die, I &s;hall die!&mdash;Oh I'm bit to death!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Captain Mirvan,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, with no little indignation, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t own I don't perceive the wit of this action; and I am &s;orry to have &s;uch cruelty practi&s;ed in my hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Lord, Ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, when his rapture abated &s;ufficiently for &s;peech, <Q REND="inline">"how could I tell they'd fall out &s;o?&mdash;by Jingo, I brought him to be a me&s;&s;mate for t'other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"I would not have been &s;erved &s;o for a thou&s;and pounds!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then there's the odds on't,"</Q> &s;aid the Cap|tain, <Q REND="inline">"for you &s;ee he is &s;erved &s;o for nothing. But come,"</Q> (turning to Mr. Lovel,) <Q REND="inline">"be of good heart, all may end well yet, and you and Mon&s;ieur Longtail be as good friends as ever."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'm &s;urpri&s;ed, Mrs. Beaumont,"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, &s;tarting up, <Q REND="inline">"that you can &s;uffer a per|&s;on under your roof to be treated &s;o inhumanly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What argufies &s;o many words?"</Q> &s;aid the
<PB N="283" REF="282">
unfeeling Captain, <Q REND="inline">"it is but a &s;lit of the ear; it only looks as if you had been in the pillory."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very true,"</Q> added Mrs. Selwyn, <Q REND="inline">and who knows but it may acquire you the credit of being an anti-mini&s;terial writer?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t,"</Q> cried Mr. Lovel, looking ruefully at his dre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"my new riding-&s;uit's all over blood!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha, ha, ha!"</Q> cried the captain, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ee what comes of &s;tudying for an hour what you &s;hall put on."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Lovel then walked to the gla&s;s, and look|ing at the place, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh Heaven, what a mon&s;trous wound! my ear will never be fit to be &s;een again!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t hide it;&mdash;'tis but wearing a wig."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A wig!"</Q> repeated the affrighted Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> wear a wig?&mdash;no, not if you would give me a thou&s;and pounds an hour!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I declare,"</Q> &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, <Q REND="inline">"I never heard &s;uch a &s;hocking propo&s;al in my life!"</Q></P>
<P>"Lord Orville then, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect that the altercation would cea&s;e, propo&s;ed to the Cap|tain to walk. He a&s;&s;ented; and having given Mr. Lovel a nod of exultation, accompanied his Lord&s;hip down &s;tairs.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Pon honour,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, the moment the door was &s;hut, <Q REND="inline">"that fellow is the greate&s;t brute in nature! he ought not to be admitted into a civilized &s;ociety."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lovel,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Coverley, affecting to whi&s;per, <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t certainly pink him: you mu&s;t not put up with &s;uch an affront."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Lovel, <Q REND="inline">"with any common per&s;on, I &s;hould not deliberate an in&s;tant; but, re|ally, with a fellow who has done nothing but fight all his life, 'pon honour, Sir, I can't think of it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lovel,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Merton, in the &s;ame voice, <Q REND="inline">"you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> call him to account."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="283">
<Q REND="inline">"Every man,"</Q> &s;aid he, petti&s;hly, <Q REND="inline">"is the be&s;t judge of his own affairs, and I don't a&s;k the ho|nour of any per&s;on's advice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Egad, Lovel,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Coverley, <Q REND="inline">"you're in for it!&mdash;you can't po&s;&s;ibly be off!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried he, very impatiently, <Q REND="inline">"upon any proper occa&s;ion, I &s;hould be as ready to &s;hew my courage as any body;&mdash;but as to fighting for &s;uch a trifle as this,&mdash;I prote&s;t I &s;hould blu&s;h to think of it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A trifle!"</Q> cried Mrs. Selwyn; <Q REND="inline">"good Hea|ven! and have you made this a&s;toni&s;hing riot about a <HI>trifle?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ma'am,"</Q> an&s;wered the poor wretch, in great confu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"I did not know at fir&s;t but that my cheek might have been bit:&mdash;but as 'tis no wor&s;e, why it does not a great deal &s;ignify. Mrs. Beau|mont, I have the honour to wi&s;h you a good even|ing; I'm &s;ure my carriage mu&s;t be waiting."</Q> And then, very abruptly, he left the room.</P>
<P>What a commotion has this mi&s;chief-loving Captain rai&s;ed! Were I to remain here long, even the &s;ociety of my dear Maria could &s;carce com|pen&s;ate for the di&s;turbances he excites.</P>
<P>When he returned, and heard of his quiet exit, his triumph was intolerable. <Q REND="inline">"I think, I think,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I have peppered him well! I'll war|rant he won't give an hour to-morrow morning to &s;ettling what he &s;hall put on; why his coat,"</Q> turn|ing to me, <Q REND="inline">"would be a mo&s;t excellent match for old Madame Furbelow's be&s;t Lyons' &s;ilk. 'Fore George, I'd de&s;ire no better &s;port, than to have that there old cat here, to go her &s;nacks!"</Q></P>
<P>All the company then, Lord Orville, Mi&s;s Mir|van, and my&s;elf excepted, played at cards, and <HI>we</HI>&mdash;oh how much better did we pa&s;s our time!"</P>
<P>While we were engaged in a mo&s;t delightful conver&s;ation, a &s;ervant brought me a letter, which
<PB N="285" REF="284">
he told me had, by &s;ome accident, been mi&s;laid. Judge my feelings, when I &s;aw, my deare&s;t Sir, your revered hand-writing! My emotions &s;oon betrayed to Lord Orville whom the letter was from: the importance of the contents he well knew, and a&s;&s;uring me I &s;hould not be &s;een by the card-players, he be&s;ought me to open it with|out delay.</P>
<P>Open it, indeed, I did;&mdash;but read it I could not,&mdash;the willing, yet aweful con&s;ent you have granted,&mdash;the tenderne&s;s of your expre&s;&s;ions,&mdash;the certainty that no ob&s;tacle remained to my eter|nal union with the loved owner of my heart, gave me &s;en&s;ations too various, and though joyful, too little placid for ob&s;ervation. Finding my&s;elf un|able to proceed, and blinded by the tears of gra|titude and delight which &s;tarted into my eyes, I gave over the attempt of reading, till I retired to my own room: and, having no voice to an|&s;wer the enquiries of Lord Orville, I put the let|ter into his hands, and left it to &s;peak both for me and it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord Orville was him&s;elf affected by your kindne&s;s; he ki&s;&s;ed the letter as he returned it, and, pre&s;&s;ing my hand affectionately to his heart, <Q REND="inline">"You are now,"</Q> (&s;aid he, in a low voice) <Q REND="inline">"all my own! Oh my Evelina, how will my &s;oul find room for its happine&s;s?&mdash;it &s;eems already bur&s;t|ing!"</Q> I could make no reply; indeed I hardly &s;poke another word the re&s;t of the evening; &s;o lit|tle talkative is the fullne&s;s of contentment.</P>
<P>O my deare&s;t Sir, the thankfulne&s;s of my heart I mu&s;t pour-forth at our meeting, when, at your feet, my happine&s;s receives its confir|mation from your ble&s;&s;ing, and when my noble|minded, my beloved Lord Orville, pre&s;ents to you the highly-honoured and thrice-happy Evelina.</P>
<P>A few lines I will endeavour to write on Thur&s;|day,
<PB N="286" REF="285">
which &s;hall be &s;ent off expre&s;s, to give you, &s;hould nothing intervene, yet more certain a&s;&s;u|rance of our meeting.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Villars to Evelina.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY wi&s;h of my &s;oul is now fulfilled&mdash;for the felicity of my Evelina is equal to her worthine&s;s!</P>
<P>Yes, my child, thy happine&s;s is engraved, in golden characters, upon the tablets of my heart! and their impre&s;&s;ion is indelible; for, &s;hould the rude and deep-&s;earching hand of Misfortune at|tempt to pluck them from their repo&s;itory, the fleeting fabric of life would give way, and in tear|ing from my vitals the nouri&s;hment by which they are &s;upported, &s;he would but gra&s;p at a &s;hadow in&s;en&s;ible to her touch.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="286">
Give thee my con&s;ent?&mdash;Oh thou joy, comfort, and pride of my life, how cold is that word to expre&s;s the fervency of my approbation! yes, I do indeed give thee my con&s;ent, and &s;o thank|fully, that, with the humble&s;t gratitude to Pro|vidence, I would &s;eal it with the remnant of my days.</P>
<P>Ha&s;ten, then, my love, to ble&s;s me with thy pre&s;ence, and to receive the ble&s;&s;ings with which my fond heart overflows!&mdash;And, oh my Evelina, hear and a&s;&s;i&s;t in one only, humble, but ardent prayer which yet animates my devotions: that the height of bli&s;s to which thou art ri&s;ing may not render thee giddy, but that the purity of thy mind may form the brighte&s;t &s;plendor of thy pro&s;|perity!&mdash;and that the weak and aged frame of thy almo&s;t idolizing parent, nearly worn out by time, pa&s;t afflictions, and infirmities, may yet be able to &s;u&s;tain a meeting with all its better part holds dear: and then, that all the wounds which the former &s;everity of fortune inflicted, may be healed and purified by the ultimate con&s;olation of pour|ing forth my dying words in ble&s;&s;ings on my child!&mdash;clo&s;ing the&s;e joy-&s;treaming eyes in her pre|&s;ence, and breathing my la&s;t faint &s;ighs in her loved arms!</P>
<P>Grieve not, oh child of my care, grieve not at the inevitable moment; but may thy own end be equally propitious! Oh may'&s;t thou when full of days, and full of honour, &s;ink down as gently to re&s;t,&mdash;be loved as kindly, watched as tenderly as thy happy father! And may'&s;t thou, when thy gla&s;s is run, be &s;weetly but not bitterly mourned, by &s;ome remaining darling of thy affections,&mdash;&s;ome yet &s;urviving Evelina!</P>
