<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>WHATE'ER the &s;ucce&s;s of your journey may be,</L>
<L>My dear rural &s;age, you are welcome to me:</L>
<L>Your benevolent projects I hope you'll complete,</L>
<L>By this trip from your &s;nug &s;cientific retreat.</L>
<L>In return for amu&s;ement you've given me there,</L>
<L>By your fine apparatus, and lectures on air,</L>
<L>I'll &s;hew you the town; and the town is a &s;cience.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>On my tutor, dear Tom, I've a perfect reliance,</L>
<L>For I know in that &s;tudy what vigils you've kept.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis the only one, truly, where I'm an adept;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4">For as to the law, that's the &s;cience of thorns,</L>
<L>And tho' its black robe my lean figure adorns,</L>
<L>Perhaps twice a year, for my father's good plea&s;ure,</L>
<L>I've renounc'd, I confe&s;s, both its toil and its trea&s;ure.</L>
<L>From my &s;apient Lord Coke this advantage I gain;</L>
<L>He led me to find out a flaw in my brain,</L>
<L>That title! on which, as wi&s;e parents have done,</L>
<L>My father laid claim to the &s;eals for his &s;on.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such language, dear Tom, is in truth but a brogue,</L>
<L>That betrays the young heir as an indolent rogue.</L>
<L>'Tis the cant of ye all&mdash;ye want talents to drudge.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! think me, my friend, wi&s;e enough for a judge,</L>
<L>I &s;till mu&s;t rejoice I have nothing to do,</L>
<L>As my heart now inclines me to wait upon you.</L>
<L>I wi&s;h I could rai&s;e you the ca&s;h you require,</L>
<L>But you know I depend on a clo&s;e-handed &s;ire,</L>
<L>Who promi&s;es largely, and often has &s;aid</L>
<L>He will make me a Croe&s;us whenever I wed;</L>
<L>But to drive me, I think, to the conjugal &s;tate,</L>
<L>Keeps the pur&s;e of the batchelor woefully &s;trait;</L>
<L>And guineas at pre&s;ent are &s;carce, to my &s;orrow.</L>
<L>How much are you now come to London to borrow?</L>
<L>Two thou&s;and, d'ye &s;ay?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! two thou&s;and at lea&s;t,</L>
<L>And perhaps rather more, as my plan is increas'd.</L>
<L>I wi&s;h for no profit, but public e&s;teem;</L>
<L>And much good to the world mu&s;t ari&s;e from my &s;cheme.</L>
</SP>

<PB N="7" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! I wi&s;h you may pro&s;per, but, as I'm a &s;inner,</L>
<L>I as &s;oon &s;hould expect a roa&s;t Phoenix for dinner,</L>
<L>As in times like the pre&s;ent &s;uch loans from a friend,</L>
<L>When Opulence has not a &s;tiver to lend.</L>
<L>You philo&s;ophers look with contempt upon ca&s;h;</L>
<L>But the fools of this town are &s;o fond of the tra&s;h,</L>
<L>That as you're a chemi&s;t, both &s;kilful and bold,</L>
<L>You had be&s;t try to make a few odd lumps of gold;</L>
<L>And this newly-found art you may try with le&s;s co&s;t,</L>
<L>Since to borrow with ea&s;e &s;eems an art that is lo&s;t.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Carele&s;s, you're welcome to rally my hopes;</L>
<L>So attack them with all your rhetorical tropes!</L>
<L>The man is ill-wrapt in philo&s;ophy's cloak,</L>
<L>Who&s;e bo&s;om is ruffled, dear Tom, by a joke.</L>
<L>I know money's &s;carce; yet I will not de&s;pond:</L>
<L>I've two friends who'll &s;upply what I want, on my bond.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! <HI>two</HI> &s;uch good friends; &s;o rich, open, and free!</L>
<L>Dear Cycle, I pray introduce them to me;</L>
<L>For not one of that ca&s;t my long li&s;t can produce:</L>
<L>Why! man, &s;uch a friend is the golden-egg'd goo&s;e;</L>
<L>You may hunt for the bird e'en as long as you're able,</L>
<L>But at la&s;t you will find it is only a fable.</L>
<L>I wanted but one hundred pounds, t'other day,</L>
<L>And a&s;k'd fifty friends, that chance threw in my way,</L>
<L>But they all &s;hook their heads, with a negative nod,</L>
<L>So I dunn'd my old father, in &s;pite of the rod.</L>
<L>But pray do I know the good creatures you mean?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye! both.&mdash;They're two friends, whom for years I've not &s;een;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6">But in juvenile days I held each as my brother,</L>
<L>And I tru&s;t that we all are &s;till dear to each other.</L>
<L>You're acquainted with Beril&mdash;</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! there, I confe&s;s;</L>
<L>Your wi&s;hes have &s;ome little chance of &s;ucce&s;s.</L>
<L>If there's one in the world, who, regardle&s;s of pelf,</L>
<L>Would relieve a friend's wants, tho' he &s;traiten'd him&s;elf;</L>
<L>You have now nam'd the man. Yet perhaps he can't lend:</L>
<L>I know he has &s;uffer'd by aiding a friend;</L>
<L>And I fancy he has but a &s;lender e&s;tate.</L>
<L>'Tis true, he don't play, tho' care&s;t by the great;</L>
<L>Yet in &s;tatues and books he's expen&s;ive 'tis, &s;aid&mdash;</L>
<L>I have &s;een him bid high for a porphyry head.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis hard, fortune &s;till &s;hould torment him with cro&s;&s;es;</L>
<L>I &s;ooth'd him to bear the &s;evere&s;t of lo&s;&s;es:</L>
<L>I was with him, when bla&s;ted in youth's blooming charm&punc;</L>
<L>His lovely Sophia was torn from his arms.</L>
<L>You knew not, I think, that unfortunate fair,</L>
<L>The victim of cruelty, love, and de&s;pair.</L>
<L>She was bound to our friend by a mutual affection,</L>
<L>But her rich &s;ordid parents oppos'd the connection.</L>
<L>The canker of &s;orrow ince&s;&s;antly prey'd</L>
<L>On the peri&s;hing bloom of the delicate maid:</L>
<L>Her duty, her &s;uff'rings, made nature relent,</L>
<L>And wrung from her father a tardy con&s;ent;</L>
<L>But death render'd vain the late &s;anction he gave,</L>
<L>And his child's bridal bed was the pitile&s;s grave.</L>
<L>Many years have now &s;often'd the lover's wild grief:</L>
<L>Perhaps &s;ome new beauty now yields him relief.</L>
<L>He's &s;till &s;ingle, I think?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! in learning and art</L>
<L>He has &s;ought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart;</L>
<L>Hence a plea&s;ing mild elegance runs thro' his life;</L>
<L>And had I a &s;i&s;ter I'd wi&s;h her his wife.&mdash;</L>
<L>But now for your &s;econd friend!&mdash;What is his name?</L>
<L>For acquaintance with him too I'll certainly claim.</L>
<L>You &s;ay that I know him: come! tell me who is it!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! indeed, it is one whom you frequently vi&s;it.</L>
<L>And here you mu&s;t own, that my hopes are well founded,</L>
<L>Since in kindne&s;s and wealth he has ever abounded;</L>
<L>And a legacy lately&mdash;</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You don't mean Bijou,</L>
<L>That collector of knick-knacks?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, Tom, I do.</L>
<L>I've a title to a&s;k any favor from him:</L>
<L>He has &s;ome little vanity, &s;ome little whim,</L>
<L>Yet &s;till he's a friendly, benevolent man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You may rap at his door&mdash;but get in if you can!</L>
<L>Your friend, when you &s;aw him, was jocund and free,</L>
<L>His heart full of bounty, his &s;pirit of glee;</L>
<L>His vanities too had &s;o mirthful a ca&s;t,</L>
<L>That Friend&s;hip her&s;elf even wi&s;h'd them to la&s;t.</L>
<L>But Marriage, that changer of mind and of feature,</L>
<L>Has made poor Bijou quite a different creature.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am told that his wife, with a pocket well laden,</L>
<L>Was a little, fat, ancient, and well-behav'd maiden;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8">Who, having a &s;imilar ta&s;te for virt&ugrave;,</L>
<L>Put her cabinet under the care of Bijou.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, indeed! in an odd fit of amorous hunger,</L>
<L>He married an old curio&s;ity-monger,</L>
<L>Who is ready to faint, if a vi&s;itor knocks</L>
<L>While &s;he's bru&s;hing the du&s;t from her raree-&s;hew box.</L>
<L>Her maid t'other day threw her into a &s;woon,</L>
<L>By cracking the eye of a great &s;tuff'd baboon;</L>
<L>For in&s;tead of young children, who&s;e trouble&s;ome noi&s;e</L>
<L>Might di&s;turb their &s;edate, <HI>virtuo&s;ical</HI> joys,</L>
<L>She fills their fine hou&s;e with new mon&s;ters or mummies.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of your &s;tory, dear Tom, I perceive what the &s;um is.</L>
<L>You don't like the lady:&mdash;&s;he may not plea&s;e you,</L>
<L>And yet be an excellent wife for Bijou.</L>
<L>I am told &s;he has really much merit and ta&s;te.</L>
<L>In her morals they &s;ay &s;he's remarkably cha&s;te;</L>
<L>So with lectures, perhaps, &s;he has wounded your ear,</L>
<L>And you rakes of the Temple may think her &s;evere.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, faith! with the lady I &s;tand very well,</L>
<L>I bought her e&s;teem with an old empty &s;hell.</L>
<L>I own &s;he has piety, morals, and &s;en&s;e:</L>
<L>To cha&s;tity no one will doubt her pretence.</L>
<L>But tho' with the&s;e virtues I freely inve&s;t her,</L>
<L>My heart, I confe&s;s, is inclin'd to dete&s;t her.</L>
<L>She has ruin'd her hu&s;band&mdash;at lea&s;t &s;o I think;</L>
<L>To a dwarf &s;he has made his benevolence &s;hrink,</L>
<L>And puff'd up his vanity into a giant.</L>
<L>To all her &s;trange whims he's &s;o &s;ervilely pliant,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9">He'd obey her caprice, what&s;oe'er it might hint,</L>
<L>And deny him&s;elf bread to buy her an odd flint.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, Tom, that's a proof of his fond tender heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>To me it proves nought but her lady&s;hip's art:</L>
<L>And &s;o you your&s;elf would explain the whole riddle,</L>
<L>If you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle,</L>
<L>As a more wretched bru&s;h never blotted poor paper,</L>
<L>And ne'er &s;queak'd a Cremona beneath a wor&s;e &s;craper.</L>
<L>Tho' pamper'd with flattery thus by his wife,</L>
<L>Our friend has quite lo&s;t all his humor and life;</L>
<L>And whenever I look on his cold chearle&s;s face,</L>
<L>As he &s;tands by the &s;ide of his wife's fo&s;&s;il-ca&s;e,</L>
<L>I think her a perfect Medu&s;a, I own,</L>
<L>Who has turn'd her poor hu&s;band him&s;elf into &s;tone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>You loungers, dear Tom, in your idle di&s;putes,</L>
<L>Love to ridicule all life's amu&s;ing pur&s;uits:</L>
<L>But they all have their u&s;e; and the lady who joys</L>
<L>In collecting an odd &s;et of whim&s;ical toys,</L>
<L>Is her&s;elf a rare gem, that my judgment regards,</L>
<L>More than all the fair votaries of &s;candal and cards.</L>
<L>I know I &s;hall like her, in &s;pite of your &s;tricture,</L>
<L>And I'm going to &s;ee how you've fail'd in her picture.</L>
<L>My old friend's good-will I &s;hall put to the trial,</L>
<L>And &s;olicit his aid without fear of denial.</L>

<L>Come along!&mdash;I will &s;ee if your welcome is hearty;</L>
<L>Indeed I may &s;erve you by joining the party,</L>

<SPEAKER>MR. BERIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>If I'm able to levy the &s;um you require,</L>
<L>The world can &s;carce give me a plea&s;ure much higher,</L>

<L>I have infinite debts of a far deeper kind.</L>
<L>I can never forget what I owe to your care,</L>

<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>DEAR Papa, don't betray me!&mdash;Her delicate mind</L>
<L>Would be wounded, I know, and would think me unkind;</L>
<L>So far from allowing, what now I impart,</L>
<L>She her&s;elf little knows the true &s;tate of her heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Believe me, my dear, I with plea&s;ure &s;urvey</L>
<L>The &s;i&s;terly fondne&s;s you warmly di&s;play.</L>
<L>But you, who for others &s;o &s;en&s;ibly feel,</L>
<L>May here be the dupe of affectionate zeal;</L>
<L>And I hope you're mi&s;taken.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dear Sir, ob&s;erve!</L>
<L>You may trace her attachment in every nerve:</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="47">If I name Mr. Beril in &s;ome idle tale,</L>
<L>Poor Fanny will blu&s;h, and as often turn pale.</L>
<L>In his ab&s;ence &s;till more and more pen&s;ive &s;he grows,</L>
<L>Yet thinks not from whence her unea&s;ine&s;s flows.</L>
<L>And when he returns, tho' her plea&s;ure is meek,</L>
<L>Yet the glow of content may be &s;een on her cheek;</L>
<L>And her heart, as if fully con&s;ol'd by his &s;ight,</L>
<L>Appears to repo&s;e in a tranquil delight.</L>
<L>Dear Papa, you'll perceive, if you'll open your eyes,</L>
<L>That from none but her&s;elf &s;he her love can di&s;gui&s;e.</L>
<L>One other exception perhaps we may find,</L>
<L>As I think Mr. Beril is equally blind,</L>
<L>And robb'd, like her&s;elf, of the talent of &s;eeing,</L>
<L>By that diffident love, which denies it own being.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hope this attachment, which neither has &s;hewn,</L>
<L>Exi&s;ts, my good girl, in your fancy alone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why &s;o, my dear Sir?&mdash;Should it prove, as you fear,</L>
<L>I hope, dear Papa, that you won't be &s;evere.</L>
<L>Con&s;ider the delicate frame of my &s;i&s;ter!</L>
<L>But I know you've a heart that can never re&s;i&s;t her,</L>
<L>If you once clearly &s;ee &s;he has fixt her affection,</L>
<L>Tho' &s;he own not her wi&s;hes for &s;uch a connection;</L>
<L>As you know that her nature's &s;o mode&s;t and meek,</L>
<L>She would die from concealment before &s;he would &s;peak.</L>
<L>I have &s;trength to encounter the cro&s;&s;es of life,</L>
<L>And to make my part good, as a daughter or wife:</L>
<L>But our gentle &s;weet Frances is ill-form'd to bear</L>
<L>The unde&s;erv'd load of vexation and care;</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="48">And therefore &s;hould wed, unregardful of pelf,</L>
<L>A hu&s;band as tender and mild as her&s;elf.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your rea&s;oning, I think, is not perfectly ju&s;t.</L>
<L>In the kindne&s;s of Beril perhaps I might tru&s;t;</L>
<L>But the motive you urge for this union, my dear,</L>
<L>Is what, I confe&s;s, would awaken my fear.</L>
<L>As you &s;ay, your mild &s;i&s;ter &s;hould never be harra&s;s'd</L>
<L>By tho&s;e various ills with which life is embarra&s;s'd,</L>
<L>I &s;hould guard her from all the vexations that wait</L>
<L>On a liberal mind with a narrow e&s;tate:</L>
<L>And if Beril had thoughts of becoming my &s;on,</L>
<L>Had I <HI>not</HI> more objections, yet this mu&s;t be one.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll remove it, my Lord, for indeed this is all:</L>
<L>As you think they'll be pinch'd by an income too &s;mall,</L>
<L>You &s;hall add to their fortune, and large it will be,</L>
<L>Two thirds of the portion you've de&s;tin'd for me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Harriot! I'm charm'd with thy &s;oul, I confe&s;s;</L>
<L>Thou'rt a generous girl&mdash;to a noble exce&s;s.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>To that name, dear Papa, I've no title, indeed,</L>
<L>As I only give up what I never can need.</L>
<L>In your hou&s;e all my wants will, I know, be &s;upply'd;</L>
<L>And if I &s;hould leave it, as Carele&s;s's bride,</L>
<L>The liberal heir of &s;o large an e&s;tate</L>
<L>Will not grieve that my fortune has &s;unk in its weight.</L>
<L>Or &s;hould my &s;wain frown at the change in my pur&s;e,</L>
<L>He may e'en take old Themis for better for wor&s;e;</L>
<L>For tho', I confe&s;s, he has won my regard,</L>
<L>Yet the knot of my love is not twi&s;ted &s;o hard,</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="49">But 'twill &s;lip in a moment, if ever I &s;ee</L>
<L>That he's rather more fond of my pur&s;e than of me,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis a pity, the friendly illu&s;ions of youth</L>
<L>Cannot in&s;tantly turn into &s;ub&s;tance and truth.</L>
<L>Your affectionate fancy, my dear, is delighted</L>
<L>With the dream of beholding two per&s;ons united,</L>
<L>Whom you fondly &s;uppo&s;e only form'd for each other.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>I &s;hould like Mr. Beril, I own, for my brother,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e I'm convinc'd, that no mortal on earth,</L>
<L>In manners, in temper, in ta&s;te, and in worth,</L>
<L>Is form'd &s;o exactly to &s;uit &s;uch a wife.</L>
<L>On their la&s;ting attachment I'd venture my life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your warm heart, my good girl, your young judgment deceives,</L>
<L>And what the fir&s;t wi&s;hes the &s;econd believes.</L>
<L>Dear Harriot, to <HI>this</HI> fancied match there may be</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Should an angel declare it, the fact I'd deny;</L>
<L>For had Beril been loaded with &s;uch a connection,</L>
<L>In his eyes I had never perceiv'd his affection.</L>
<L>But I'll pre&s;ently &s;olve any doubts of this kind,</L>
