<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE man&s;ion-hou&s;e of the plea&s;ant village of <HI>Beachgrove</HI> was inhabited by the family of FAIRBORNE, con&s;i&s;ting of the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, and a numer|ous progeny of children of both &s;exes. Of the&s;e, part were educated at home under their parents' care, and part were &s;ent out to &s;chool. The hou&s;e was &s;el|dom unprovided with vi&s;itors, the inti|mate friends or relations of the owners, who were entertained with cheerfulne&s;s and ho&s;pitality, free from ceremony and parade. They formed, during their &s;tay, part of the family; and were rea|dy to concur with Mr. and Mrs. Fair|borne in any little dome&s;tic plan for va|rying their amu&s;ements, and particu|larly for promoting the in&s;truction and entertainment of the younger part of
<PB N="2" REF="5">
the hou&s;ehold. As &s;ome of them were accu&s;tomed to writing, they would fre|quently produce a fable, a &s;tory, or dialogue, adapted to the age and un|der&s;tanding of the young people. It was always con&s;idered as a high favour when they would &s;o employ them&s;elves; and after the pieces were once read over, they were carefully depo&s;ited by Mrs. Fairborne in a box, of which &s;he kept the key. None of the&s;e were al|lowed to be taken out again till all the children were a&s;&s;embled in the holidays. It was then made one of the evening amu&s;ements of the family to <HI>rummage the budget,</HI> as their phra&s;e was. One of the lea&s;t children was &s;ent to the box, who putting in its little hand, drew out the paper that came next, and brought it into the parlour. This was then read di&s;tinctly by one of the older ones; and after it had undergone &s;ufficient con&s;i|deration, another little me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched for a fre&s;h &s;upply; and &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="6">
on, till as much time had been &s;pent in this manner as the parents thought pro|per. Other children were admitted to the&s;e readings; and as the <HI>Budget of Beachgrove Hall</HI> became &s;omewhat ce|lebrated in the neighbourhood, its pro|prietors were at length urged to lay it open to the public. They were induced to comply; and have pre&s;ented its con|tents in the promi&s;cuous order in which they came to hand, which they think will prove more agreeable than a me|thodical arrangement. Thus, there|fore, without further preface, begins the</P>

<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>COME, my boys, let us &s;it down awhile under yon &s;hady tree. I don't
<PB N="4" REF="7">
know how your young legs feel, but mine are almo&s;t tired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not tired, but I am very hot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am hot, and very dry too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you have cooled your|&s;elf, you may drink out of that clear brook. In the mean time we will read a little out of a book I have in my pocket.</P>
<STAGE>[They go and &s;it down at the foot of the tree.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an amazing large tree? How wide its branches &s;pread! Pray what tree is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you that. It is an Oak. Don't you &s;ee the acorns?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is an Oak&mdash;the noble&s;t tree this country produces:&mdash;not only grand and beautiful to the &s;ight, but of the greate&s;t importance from its u&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like to know &s;omething about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; then in&s;tead of read|ing, we will &s;it and talk about Oaks. George, you knew the Oak by its acorns&mdash;&s;hould you have known it if there had been none?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know&mdash;I believe not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ob&s;erve, then, in the fir&s;t place, that its bark is very rugged. Then &s;ee in what manner it grows. Its great arms run out almo&s;t horizontally from its trunk, giving the whole tree a &s;ort of round form, and making it &s;pread far on every &s;ide. Its branches are al&s;o &s;ubject to be crooked, or kneed. By the&s;e marks you might gue&s;s at an Oak even in winter, when quite bare of leaves. But its leaves afford a &s;urer mark of di&s;tinction, &s;ince they differ a good deal from tho&s;e of other trees; being neither whole and even at the edges, not yet cut like the teeth of a &s;aw, but rather deeply &s;colloped, and formed into &s;everal rounded divi&s;ions.

Their colour is a fine deep green.</P>
<P>Then the fruit&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fruit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;all kinds of plants have what may properly be called fruit, though we are apt to give that name only to &s;uch as are food for man. The fruit of a plant is the &s;eed, with what contains it. This, in the Oak, is call|ed an acorn, whch is a kind of nut, partly enclo&s;ed in a cup.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Acorn-cups are very pretty things. I have made boats of them, and &s;et them a &s;wimming in a ba&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if you were no bigger than a fairy, you might u&s;e them for drink|ing cups, as tho&s;e imaginary little be|ings are &s;aid to do.</P>
<Q><L>Pearly drops of dew we drink</L>
<L>In acorn-cups fill'd to the brink.</L></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are acorns good to eat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that they are not. I have tried, and did not like them at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the early ages of man, before he cultivated the earth, but lived upon &s;uch wild products as nature afforded, we are told that acorns made a con&s;i|derable part of his food; and at this day I believe they are eaten in &s;ome coun|tries. But this is in warmer climates, where they probably become &s;weeter and better-flavoured than with us. The chief u&s;e we make of them is to feed hogs. In tho&s;e parts of England where Oak woods are common, great herds of &s;wine are kept, which are driven in|to the woods in autumn, when the acorns fall, and provide for them&s;elves plenti|fully for two or three months. This however, is a &s;mall part of the prai&s;e of the Oak. You will be &s;urpri&s;ed when I tell you, that to this tree our country owes its chief glory and &s;ecurity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, how can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether in your reading you have ever met with the &s;tory, that Athens, a famous city in
<PB N="8" REF="11">
Greece, con&s;ulting the oracle how it might be&s;t defend it&s;elf again&s;t its enemies, was advi&s;ed to tru&s;t to wooden walls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wooden walls!&mdash;that's odd&mdash;I &s;hould think &s;tone walls better, for wooden ones might be &s;et on fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but the meaning was, that as Athens was a place of great trade, and its people were &s;killed in maritime affairs, they ought to tru&s;t to their &s;hips. Well, this is the ca&s;e with Great Bri|tain. As it is an i&s;land, it has no need of walls and fortifications while it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es &s;hips to keep all enemies at a di&s;|tance. Now, we have the greate&s;t and fine&s;t navy in the world, by which we both defend our&s;elves, and attack other nations when they in&s;ult us; and this is all built of Oak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would no other wood do to build &s;hips?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>None nearly &s;o well, e&s;pecially for men of war; for it is the &s;toute&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t wood we have; and there|fore
<PB N="9" REF="12">
be&s;t fitted, both to keep &s;ound un|der water, and to bear the blows and &s;hocks of the waves, and the terrible &s;trokes of cannon balls. It is a peculiar excellence for this la&s;t purpo&s;e, that Oak is not &s;o liable to &s;plinter or &s;hiver as other woods, &s;o that a ball can pa&s;s through it without making a large hole. Did you never hear the old &s;ong,<Q>Heart of Oak are our &s;hips, hearts of Oak are our men, &amp;c.?</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was made at a time when England was more &s;ucce&s;sful in war than had ever before been known, and our &s;ucce&s;s was properly attributed chiefly to our fleet, the great &s;upport of which is the Briti&s;h Oak; &s;o I hope you will henceforth look upon Oaks with due re&s;pect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;it &s;hall always be my fa|vourite tree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had not Pope rea&s;on, when &s;aid, in his <HI>Wind&s;or Fore&s;t,</HI><Q><PB N="10" REF="13">
<L>Let India boa&s;t her plants, nor envy we</L>
<L>The weeping amber, or the balmy tree,</L>
<L>While by our <HI>Oaks</HI> the precious loads are borne,</L>
<L>And realms commanded which tho&s;e trees adorn?</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e lines refer to its u&s;e as well for merchant &s;hips as for men of war; and in fact all our &s;hips are built either of native or foreign Oak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are the ma&s;ts of &s;hips made of Oak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;it would be too heavy. Be&s;ides, it would not be ea&s;y to find trunks of Oak long and &s;traight enough for that purpo&s;e. They are made of various kinds of fir or pine, which grow very tall and taper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is Oak wood u&s;ed for any thing be&s;ides &s;hip-building?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes!&mdash;It is one of the prin|cipal woods of the carpenter, being em|ployed wherever great &s;trength and du|rability are required. It is u&s;ed for door and window frames, and the beams that are laid in walls to &s;trengthen them.
<PB N="11" REF="14">
Floors and &s;tairca&s;es are &s;ometimes made with it; and in old hou&s;es in the coun|try, which were built when Oak was more plentiful than at pre&s;ent, almo&s;t all the timber about them is Oak. It is al&s;o occa&s;ionally u&s;ed for furniture, as tables, chairs, drawers, and bed&s;teads; though mahogany has now much taken its place for the better &s;ort of goods, and the lighter and &s;ofter woods for the cheaper: for the hardne&s;s of Oak ren|ders it difficult and expen&s;ive to work. It is &s;till, however, the chief material u&s;ed in mill-work, in bridge and water|works, for waggon and cart bodies, for large ca&s;ks and tubs, and for the la&s;t piece of furniture a man has occa&s;ion for. What is that, do you think, George?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>A coffin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why &s;hould that be made of &s;uch &s;trong wood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>There can be no other rea&s;on, than that weak attachment we are apt to have for our bodies when we have done with them, which has made men in various countries de&s;irous of keeping them as long as po&s;&s;ible from decay. But I have not yet done with the u&s;es of the Oak. Were either of you ever in a tanner's yard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>We often go by one at the end of the town; but we dur&s;t not go in for fear of the great dog.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he is always chained in the day-time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;but he barks &s;o loud, and looks &s;o fierce, that we were afraid he would break his chain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt you are a couple of cow|ards. However, I &s;uppo&s;e you came near enough to ob&s;erve great &s;tacks of bark in the yard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes&mdash;there are &s;everal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e are Oak bark, and it is u&s;ed in tanning the hides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does it do to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you. Every part of the Oak abounds in a quality called <HI>a&s;trin|gency,</HI> or a binding power. The effect of this is to make more clo&s;e and com|pact, or to &s;hrivel up, all &s;oft things, and thereby make them firmer and le&s;s liable to decay. The hide, then, when taken from the animal, after being &s;teep|ed in lime and water to get off the hair and grea&s;e, is put to &s;oak in a li|quor made by boiling Oak bark in wa|ter. This liquor is &s;trongly a&s;tringent, and by &s;tiffening the &s;oft hide, turns it into what we call leather. Other things are al&s;o tanned for the purpo&s;e of pre|&s;erving them, as fi&s;hing nets, and boat|&s;ails. This u&s;e of the bark of the Oak makes it a very valuable commodity; and you may &s;ee people in the woods carefully &s;tripping the Oaks when cut down, and piling up the bark in heaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="17">
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;een &s;uch heaps of bark, but I thought they were only to burn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>No,&mdash;they are much too valu|able for that. Well, but I have an|other u&s;e of the Oak to mention, and that is in dying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dying! I wonder what colour it can dye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oak &s;aw-du&s;t is a principal in|gredient in dying &s;u&s;tians. By various mixtures and managements it is made to give them all the different &s;hades of drab and brown. Then, all the parts of the Oak, like all other a&s;tringent ve|getables, produce a dark blue or black by the addition of any preparation of iron. The bark is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in this way for dying black. And did you ever &s;ee what boys call an Oak|apple?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;I have gathered them my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know what they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="18">
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought they were the fruit of the Oak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;I have told you that the acorns are the fruit. The&s;e are ex|cre&s;cences formed by an in&s;ect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>An in&s;ect&mdash;how can they make &s;uch a thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a &s;ort of fly, that has a power of pie cing the outer &s;kin of the Oak boughs, under which it lays its eggs. The part then &s;wells into a kind of ball, and the young in&s;ects, when hatched, eat their way out. Well; this ball or apple is a pretty &s;trong a&s;trin|gent, and is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in dying black. But in the warm countries, there is a &s;pecies of Oak which bears round excre&s;cences of the &s;ame kind, called galls, which become hard, and are the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;tringents known. They are the principal ingredients in the black dyes, and common ink is made with them, together with a &s;ub|&s;tance
<PB N="16" REF="19">
called green vitriol or copperas, which contains iron.</P>
<P>I have now told you the chief u&s;es that I can recollect of the Oak; and the&s;e are &s;o important, that whoever drops an acorn into the ground, and takes proper care of it when it comes up, may be &s;aid to be a benefactor to his country. Be&s;ides, no &s;ight can be more beautiful and maje&s;tic than a fine Oak wood. It is an ornament fit for the habitation of the fir&s;t nobleman in the land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, then, that all rich gentlemen who have ground enough, do not cover it with Oaks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many of them, e&s;pecially of late years, have made great plantations of the&s;e trees. But all &s;oils do not &s;uit them; and then there is another circum|&s;tance which prevents many from being at this trouble and expence, which is, the long time an Oak takes in grow|ing, &s;o that no per&s;on can rea&s;onably
<PB N="17" REF="20">
expect to profit by tho&s;e of his own planting. An Oak of fifty years is greatly &s;hort of its full growth, and they are &s;carcely arrived at perfection under a century. However, it is our duty to think of po&s;terity as well as our&s;elves; and they who receive Oaks from their ance&s;tors, ought certainly to furni&s;h others to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I think that every one who cuts down an Oak &s;hould be oblig|ed to plant another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very right&mdash;but he &s;hould plant two or three for one, for fear of acci|cidents in their growing</P>
<P>I will now repeat to you &s;ome ver&s;es de&s;cribing the Oak in its &s;tate of full growth, or rather of beginning decay, with the various animals living upon it&mdash;and then we will walk.</P>
<Q><L>See where you <HI>Oak</HI> its awful &s;tructure rears,</L>
<L>The ma&s;&s;y growth of twice a hundred years;</L>
<L>Survey his rugged trunk with mo&s;s o'ergrown,</L>
<L>His lu&s;ty arms in rude di&s;order thrown,</L>

His forking branches wide at di&s;tance &s;pread,</L>
<L>And, dark'ning half the &s;ky, his lofty head;</L>
<L>A mighty ca&s;tle, built by nature's hands,</L>
<L>Peopled by various living tribes, he &s;tands.</L>
<L>His airy top the clamorous rooks inve&s;t,</L>

<P>A YOUNG Mou&s;e lived in a cupboard where &s;weetmeats were kept; &s;he dined every day upon bi&s;cuit, marmalade, or fine &s;ugar. Never any little Mou&s;e had lived &s;o well.

<P>A WASP met a Bee, and &s;aid to him, Pray, can you tell me what is the rea&s;on that men are &s;o illnatured to me, while they are &s;o fond of you?

<P>ONE winter's evening, as <HI>Captain Compa&s;s</HI> was &s;itting by the fire-&s;ide with his children all round him, little Jack &s;aid to him, Papa, pray tell us &s;ome &s;tories about what you have &s;een in your voyages. I have been va&s;tly entertain|ed whil&s;t you were abroad, with Gul|liver's Travels, and the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor; and I think, as you have gone round and round the world, you mu&s;t have met with things as won|derful as they did.&mdash;No, my dear, &s;aid the Captain, I never met with Lillipu|tians or Brobdingnagians, I a&s;&s;ure you, nor ever &s;aw the black load&s;tone moun|tain, or the valley of diamonds; but, to be &s;ure, I have &s;een a great variety of people, and their different manners and ways of living; and if it will be any entertainment to you, I will tell you
<PB N="23" REF="26">
&s;ome curious particulars of what I ob|&s;erved.&mdash;Pray do, Papa, cried Jack and all his brothers and &s;i&s;ters; &s;o they drew clo&s;e round him, and he began as follows.</P>
<P>Well then&mdash;I was once, about this time of the year, in a country where it was very cold, and the poor inhabitants had much ado to keep them&s;elves from &s;tarving. They were clad partly in the &s;kins of bea&s;ts made &s;oft and &s;mooth by a particular art, but chiefly in gar|ments made from the outer covering of a middle-&s;ized quadruped, which they were &s;o cruel as to &s;trip off his back while he was alive. They dwelt in ha|bitations, part of which was &s;unk under ground. The materials were either &s;tones, or earth hardened by fire; and &s;o violent in that country were the &s;torms of wind and rain, that many of them covered their roofs all over with &s;tones. The walls of their hou&s;es had holes to let in the light; but to prevent
<PB N="24" REF="27">
the cold air and wet from coming in, they were covered with a &s;ort of tran&s;|parent &s;tone, made artificially of melted &s;and or flints. As wood was rather &s;carce, I know not what they would have done for firing, had they not di&s;|covered in the bowels of the earth a very extraordinary kind of &s;tone, which when put among burning wood, caught fire and flamed like a torch.</P>
<P>Dear me, &s;aid Jack, what a wonder|ful &s;tone! I &s;uppo&s;e it was &s;omewhat like what we call fire-&s;tones, that &s;hine &s;o when we rub them together.&mdash;I don't think they would burn, replied the Cap|tain; be&s;ides, the&s;e are of a darker co|lour.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;but their diet too was re|markable. Some of them eat fi&s;h that had been hung up in the &s;moke till they were quite dry and hard; and along with it they eat either the roots of plants, or a &s;ort of coar&s;e black cake made of powdered &s;eeds. The&s;e were the poorer
<PB N="25" REF="28">
cla&s;s: the richer had a whiter kind of cake, which they were fond of daubing over with a grea&s;y matter that was the product of a large animal among them. This grea&s;e they u&s;ed, too, in almo&s;t all their di&s;hes, and when fre&s;h, it really was not unpalatable. They likewi&s;e devoured the fle&s;h of many birds and bea&s;ts when they could get it; and eat the leaves and other parts of a variety of vegetables growing in the country, &s;ome ab&s;olutely raw, others variou&s;ly prepared by the aid of fire. Another great article of food was the curd of milk, pre&s;&s;ed into a hard ma&s;s and &s;alt|ed. This had &s;o rank a &s;mell, that per|&s;ons of weak &s;tomachs often could not bear to come near it. For drink, they made great u&s;e of the water in which certain dry leaves had been &s;teeped. The&s;e leaves, I was told, came from a great di&s;tance. They had likewi&s;e a method of preparing a liquor of the &s;eeds of a gra&s;s-like plant &s;teeped in
<PB N="26" REF="29">
water, with the addition of a bitter herb, and then &s;et to work or ferment. I was prevailed upon to ta&s;te it, and thought it at fir&s;t nau&s;eous enough, but in time I liked it pretty well. When a large quantity of the ingredints is u&s;ed, it becomes perfectly intoxicating. But what a&s;toni&s;hed me mo&s;t, was their u&s;e of a liquor &s;o exce&s;&s;ively hot and pun|gent, that it &s;eems like liquid fire. I once got a mouthful of it by mi&s;take, taking it for water, which it re&s;embles in appearance; but I thought it would in&s;tantly have taken away my breath. Indeed, people are not unfrequently killed by it; and yet many of them will &s;wallow it greedily whenever they can get it. This, too, is &s;aid to be pre|pared from the &s;eeds above-mentioned, which are innocent and even &s;alutary in their natural &s;tate, though made to yield &s;uch a pernicious juice. The &s;trange&s;t cu&s;tom that I believe prevails in any na|tion I found here, which was, that &s;ome
<PB N="27" REF="30">
take a mighty plea&s;ure in filling their mouths full of &s;tinking &s;moke; and others, in thru&s;ting a na&s;ty powder up their no&s;trils.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think it would choke them, &s;aid Jack. It almo&s;t did me, an&s;wered his father, only to &s;tand by while they did it&mdash;but u&s;e, it is truly &s;aid, is &s;e|cond nature.</P>
<P>I was glad enough to leave this cold climate; and about half a year after, I fell in with a people enjoying a delicious temperature of air, and a country full of beauty and verdure. The trees and &s;hrubs were furni&s;hed with a great va|riety of fruits, which, with other ve|getable products, con&s;tituted a large part of the food of the inhabitants. I particularly reli&s;hed certain berries grow|ing in bunches, &s;ome white and &s;ome red, of a very plea&s;ant &s;ouri&s;h ta&s;te, and &s;o tran&s;parent, that one might &s;ee the &s;eeds at their very centre. Here were whole fields full of extremely odorifer|ous
<PB N="28" REF="31">
flowers, which they told me were &s;ucceeded by pods bearing &s;eeds, that afforded good nouri&s;hment to man and bea&s;t. A great variety of birds enli|vened the groves and woods; among which I was entertained with one, that without any teaching &s;poke almo&s;t as articulately as a parrot, though indeed it was all the repetition of a &s;ingle word. The people were tolerably gentle and civilized, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many of the arts of life. Their dre&s;s was very various. Many were clad only in a thin cloth made of the long fibres of the &s;talk of a plant cultivated for the purpo&s;e, which they prepared by &s;oaking in water, and then beating with large mallets. Others wore cloth wove from a &s;ort of vegeta|ble wool, growing in pods upon bu&s;hes. But the mo&s;t &s;ingular material was a fine glo&s;&s;y &s;tuff, u&s;ed chiefly by the richer cla&s;&s;es, which, as I was credibly in|formed, is manufactured out of the webs of caterpillars&mdash;a mo&s;t wonderful cir|cum&s;tance,
<PB N="29" REF="32">
if we con&s;ider the immen&s;e number of caterpillars nece&s;&s;ary to the production of &s;o large a quantity of the &s;tuff as I &s;aw u&s;ed. This people are very fanta&s;tic in their dre&s;s, e&s;pecially the women, who&s;e apparel con&s;i&s;ts of a great number of articles impo&s;&s;ible to be de&s;cribed, and &s;trangely di&s;gui&s;ing the natural form of the body. In &s;ome in|&s;tances they &s;eem very cleanly; but in others, the Hottentots can &s;carce go beyond them; particularly in the ma|nagement of their hair, which is all matted and &s;tiffened with the fat of &s;wine and other animals, mixed up with powders of various colours and ingre|dients. Like mo&s;t Indian nations, they u&s;e feathers in the head-dre&s;s. One thing &s;urpri&s;ed me much, which was, that they bring up in their hou&s;es an animal of the tyger kind, with formi|dable teeth and claws, which, notwith|&s;tanding its natural ferocity, is played
<PB N="30" REF="33">
with and care&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t timid and delicate of their women.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I would not play with it, &s;aid Jack. Why you might chance to get an ugly &s;cratch if you did, &s;aid the Captain.</P>
<P>The language of this nation &s;eems very har&s;h and unintelligible to a fo|reigner, yet they conver&s;e among one another with great ea&s;e and quickne&s;s. One of the odde&s;t cu&s;toms is that which men u&s;e on &s;aluting each other. Let the weather be what it will, they un|cover their heads, and remain unco|vered for &s;ome time, if they mean to be extraordinarily re&s;pectful.</P>
<P>Why that's like pulling off our hats, &s;aid Jack. Ah, ha! Papa, cried Bet|&s;ey, I have found you out. You have been telling us of our own country and what is done at home all this while. But, &s;aid Jack, we don't burn &s;tones, nor eat grea&s;e and powdered &s;eeds, nor
<PB N="31" REF="34">
wear &s;kins and caterpillars' webs, nor play with tygers. No? &s;aid the Cap|tain&mdash;pray what are coals but &s;tones; and is not butter, grea&s;e; and corn, &s;eeds; and leather, &s;kins; and &s;ilk the web of a kind of caterpillar; and may we not as well call a cat an animal of the tyger-kind, as a tyger an animal of the cat-kind? So, if you recollect what I have been de&s;cribing, you will find, with Bet&s;ey's help, that all the other wonderful things I have told you of are matters familiar among our&s;elves. But I meant to &s;how you, that a foreigner might ea&s;ily repre&s;ent every thing as equally &s;trange and wonderful among us, as we could do with re&s;pect to his country; and al&s;o to make you &s;en&s;ible that we daily call a great many things by their names, without ever enquiring into their nature and properties; &s;o that, in reality, it is only the names, and not the things them&s;elves, with which we are acquainted.</P>

<HEAD>THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.</HEAD>
<P>IN a plea&s;ant wood, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of a ridge of mountains, there lived a <HI>Squirrel,</HI> who had pa&s;&s;ed two or three years of his life very happily. At length he began to grow di&s;contented, and one day fell into the following &s;oliloquy.</P>
<P>What, mu&s;t I &s;pend all my time in this &s;pot, running up and down the &s;ame trees, gathering nuts and acorns, and dozing away months together in a hole! I &s;ee a great many of the birds who in|habit this wood ramble about to a di&s;|tance wherever their fancy leads them, and at the approach of winter, &s;et out for &s;ome remote country, where they enjoy &s;ummer weather all the year round. My neighbour Cuckow tells me he is ju&s;t going; and even little Nightingale will &s;oon follow. To be &s;ure, I have
<PB N="44" REF="49">
not wings like them, but I have legs nimble enough; and if one does not u&s;e them, one might as well be a mole or a dormou&s;e. I dare &s;ay I could ea&s;ily reach to that blue ridge which I &s;ee from the tops of the trees; which no doubt mu&s;t be a fine place, for the &s;un comes directly from it every morning, and it often appears all covered with red and yellow, and the fine&s;t colours ima|ginable. There can be no harm, at lea&s;t, in trying, for I can &s;oon get back again if I don't like it. I am re&s;olved to go, and I will &s;et out to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>When Squirrel had taken this re&s;o|tion, he could not &s;leep all night for thinking of it; and at peep of day, pru|dently taking with him as much provi|&s;ion as he could conveniently carry, he began his journey in high &s;pirits. He pre&s;ently got to the out&s;ide of the wood, and entered upon the open moors that reached to the foot of the hills. The&s;e he
<PB N="45" REF="50">
cro&s;&s;ed before the &s;un was gotten high; and then, having eaten his breakfa&s;t with an excellent appetite, he began to a&s;cend. It was heavy, toil&s;ome work &s;crambling up the &s;teep &s;ides of the mountains; but Squirrel was u&s;ed to climbing; &s;o for a while he proceeded expeditiou&s;ly. Often, however, was he obliged to &s;top and take breath; &s;o that it was a good deal pa&s;t noon before he had arrived at the &s;ummit of the fir&s;t cliff. Here he &s;at down to eat his din|ner; and looking back, was wonderfully plea&s;ed with the fine pro&s;pect. The wood in which he lived lay far beneath his feet; and he viewed with &s;corn the humble habitation in which he had been born and bred.</P>
<P>When he looked forwards, however, he was &s;omewhat di&s;couraged to ob&s;erve that another eminence ro&s;e above him, full as di&s;tant as that to which he had already reached; and he now began to feel &s;tiff and fatigued. However, after
<PB N="46" REF="51">
a little re&s;t, he &s;et out again, though not &s;o bri&s;kly as before. The ground was rugged, brown, and bare; and to his great &s;urpri&s;e, in&s;tead of finding it warmer as he got nearer the &s;un, he felt it grow colder and colder. He had not travelled two hours before his &s;trength and &s;pirits were almo&s;t &s;pent; and he &s;eriou&s;ly thought of giving up the point, and returning before night &s;hould come on. While he was thus deliberat|ing with him&s;elf, clouds began to ga|ther round the mountain, and to take away all view of di&s;tant objects. Pre|&s;ently a &s;torm of mingled &s;now and hail came down, driven by a violent wind, which pelted poor Squirrel mo&s;t pity|fully, and made him quite unable to move forwards or backwards. Be&s;ides, he had completely lo&s;t his road, and did not know which way to turn towards that de&s;pi&s;ed home, which it was now his only de&s;ire again to reach. The &s;torm la&s;ted till the approach of night;
<PB N="47" REF="52">
and it was as much as he could do, be|numbed and weary as he was, to crawl to the hollow of a rock at &s;ome di&s;|tance, which was the be&s;t lodging he could find for the night. His provi|&s;ions were &s;pent; &s;o that, hungry and &s;hivering, he crept into the furthe&s;t cor|ner of the cavern, and rolling him&s;elf up, with his bu&s;hy tail over his back, he got a little &s;leep, though di&s;turbed by the cold, and the &s;hrill whi&s;tling of the wind among the &s;tones.</P>
<P>The morning broke over the di&s;tant tops of the mountains, when Squirrel, half frozen and fami&s;hed, came out of his lodging, and advanced, as well as he could, towards the brow of the hill, that he might di&s;cover which way to take. As he was &s;lowly creeping a|long, a hungry kite, &s;oaring in the air above, de&s;cried him, and making a &s;toop, carried him off in her talons. Poor Squirrel, lo&s;ing his &s;en&s;es with the fright, was borne away with va&s;t ra|pidity,
<PB N="48" REF="53">
and &s;eemed inevitably doomed to become food for the kite's young ones: when an eagle, who had &s;een the kite &s;eize her prey, pur&s;ued her in order to take it from her; and overtaking her, gave her &s;uch a buffet, as cau&s;ed her to drop the Squirrel in order to de|fend her&s;elf. The poor animal kept falling through the air a long time, till at la&s;t he alighted in the mid&s;t of a thick tree, the leaves and tender boughs of which &s;o broke his fall, that, though &s;tunned and breathle&s;s, he e&s;caped with|out material injury, and after lying a|while, came to him&s;elf again. But what was his plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e, to find him&s;elf in the very tree which con|tained his ne&s;t. Ah! &s;aid he, my dear native place and peaceful home! if ever I am again tempted to leave you, may I undergo a &s;econd time all the mi&s;eries and dangers from which I am now &s;o wonderfully e&s;caped.</P>

<P>I believe you would not much like it con&s;tantly: be&s;ides, they can hardly get enough of that. But you &s;eem to know almo&s;t as little of the poor as the young French prince&s;s did.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="53" REF="58">
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there had been one year &s;o bad a harve&s;t in France, that numbers of the poor were fami&s;hed to death. This calamity was &s;o much talked of, that it reached the court, and was mentioned before the young prin|ce&s;&s;es. Dear me! &s;aid one of them, how <HI>&s;illy</HI> that was! Why, rather than be fami&s;hed, I would eat bread and chee&s;e. Her governe&s;s was then oblig|ed to acquaint her, that the greate&s;t part of her father's &s;ubjects &s;carcely ever eat any thing better than black bread all their lives; and that va&s;t num|bers would now think them&s;elves very happy to get only half their u&s;ual pit|tance of that. Such wretchedne&s;s as this was what the prince&s;s had not the lea&s;t idea of; and the account &s;hocked her &s;o much, that &s;he was glad to &s;a|crifice all her &s;inery to afford &s;ome relief to the &s;ufferings of the poor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="54" REF="59">
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope there is nobody fa|mi&s;hed in our country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, for we have laws by which every per&s;on is entitled to relief from the pari&s;h, if he is unable to gain a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and were there no laws about it, I am &s;ure it would be our duty to part with every &s;uperfluity, rather than let a fellow creature peri&s;h for want of nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then do you think it was wrong for Mi&s;s Pemberton to have all tho&s;e fine things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, if they are &s;uitable to her fortune, and do not con|&s;ume the money which ought to be em|ployed in more u&s;eful things for her&s;elf and others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why might not &s;he be con|tented with &s;uch things as I have; and give the money that the re&s;t co&s;t to the poor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e &s;he can afford both
<PB N="55" REF="60">
to be charitable to the poor, and al&s;o to indulge her&s;elf in the&s;e plea&s;ures. But do you recollect, that the children of Mr. White the baker, and Mr. Shape the taylor, might a&s;k ju&s;t the &s;ame que&s;tions about you?</P>
</SP>

<P>How &s;o?</P>

<P>Are not you as much bet|ter dre&s;&s;ed, and as much more plenti|fully &s;upplied with playthings than they are, as Mi&s;s Pemberton is than you?</P>

<P>Why, I believe I may; for I remember Polly White was very glad of one of my old dolls; and Nancy Shape cried for &s;uch a &s;a&s;h as mine, but her mother would not let her have one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you &s;ee, my dear, that there are many who have fewer things to be thankful for than <HI>you</HI> have; and you may al&s;o learn what ought to be the true mea&s;ure of the expectations of children, and the indulgencies of pa|rents.</P>

<P>Every thing ought to be &s;uited to the &s;tation in which we live, or are likely to live, and the wants and duties of it. Your papa and I do not grudge laying out part of our money to promote the innocent plea&s;ure of our children; but it would be very wrong in us to lay out &s;o much on this ac|count, as would oblige us to &s;pare in more nece&s;&s;ary articles, as in their edu|cation, and the common hou&s;ehold ex|pences required in our way of living.

<P>How could that be, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you were now to be dre&s;&s;ed like Mi&s;s Pemberton, don't you think you &s;hould be greatly mortified at being wor&s;e dre&s;&s;ed when you came to be a young woman?</P>
</SP>

<P>I believe I &s;hould, mamma;

<P>Well, but it would be &s;till more improper for us to dre&s;s you then beyond our circum&s;tances, becau&s;e your nece&s;&s;ary clothes will then co&s;t more, you know. Then if we were now to hire a coach or chair for you to go a vi&s;iting in, &s;hould you like to leave it off ever afterwards? But you have no rea&s;on to expect that you will be able to have tho&s;e indulgencies when you are a wo|man. And &s;o it is in every thing el&s;e. The more fine things, and the more gratifications you have now, the more you will require hereafter; for cu&s;tom makes things &s;o familiar to us, that while we enjoy them le&s;s, we want them more.</P>

<P>LET us &s;it down a while on this bench, and look about us. What a charming pro&s;pect!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire tho&s;e plea&s;ure grounds. What beautiful clumps of trees there are in that lawn!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what a dark gloomy wood that is at the back of the hou&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a fir-plantation; and tho&s;e trees always look di&s;mal in the &s;ummer, when there are &s;o many finer greens to compare them with. But the winter is their time for &s;how, when other trees are &s;tripped of their verdure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="69">
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they are evergreens?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; mo&s;t of the fir-tribe are evergreens; and as they are generally natives of cold mountainous countries, they contribute greatly to cheer the wintry land&s;cape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were &s;o good, when we walked out la&s;t, to tell us a good deal about Oaks. I thought it one of the prettie&s;t le&s;&s;ons I ever heard. I &s;hould be very glad if you would give us &s;uch another about Firs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;hould I too, I am &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart; and I am plea&s;ed that you a&s;k me. Nothing is &s;o great an encouragement to a tutor as to find his pupils of their own accord &s;eek|ing after u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think it is very u&s;eful to know &s;uch things as the&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly it is. Well then&mdash;You may know the Pine or Fir-tribe in general at fir&s;t &s;ight, as mo&s;t of them are of a blui&s;h-green colour, and all
<PB N="65" REF="70">
have leaves con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;trong nar|row pointed blade, which gives them &s;omewhat of a &s;tiff appearance. Then all of them bear a hard &s;caly fruit, of a longi&s;h or conical form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they what we call Fir-ap|ples?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; that is one of the names boys give them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>We often pick them up under trees, and throw them at one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;ometimes brought home my pocket full to burn. They make a fine clear flame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;do you know where the &s;eeds lie in them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;have they any?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;at the bottom of every &s;cale lie two winged &s;eeds; but when the &s;cales open, the &s;eeds fall out; &s;o that you can &s;eldom find any in tho&s;e you pick up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are the &s;eeds good for any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="71">
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a kind of Pine in the &s;outh of Europe called the <HI>Stone Pine,</HI> the kernels of which are eaten, and &s;aid to be as &s;weet as an almond. And birds pick out the &s;eeds of other &s;orts, though they are &s;o well defended by the woody &s;cales.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>They mu&s;t have good &s;trong bills, then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of this tribe of trees a variety of &s;pecies are found in different coun|tries, and are cultivated in this. But the only kind native here, is the <HI>Wild Pine,</HI> or <HI>Scotch Fir.</HI> Of this there are large natural fore&s;ts in the highlands of Scotland; and the principal plantations con&s;i&s;t of it. It is a hardy &s;ort, fit for barren and mountainous &s;oils, but grows &s;lowly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what are tho&s;e very tall trees that grow in two rows before the old hall in our village?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are the <HI>Common</HI> or <HI>Spruce Fir,</HI> a native of Norway and other
<PB N="67" REF="72">
northern countries, and one of the lof|tie&s;t of the tribe. But ob&s;erve tho&s;e trees that grow &s;ingly in the grounds op|po&s;ite to us, with wide-&s;pread branches, pointing downwards, and trailing on the ground, thence gradually le&s;&s;ening, till the top of the tree ends almo&s;t in a point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What beautiful trees!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are the Pines called <HI>Larches,</HI> natives of the Alps and Apen|nines, and now frequently planted to decorate our gardens. The&s;e are not properly evergreens, as they &s;hed their leaves in winter, but quickly recover them again. Then we have be&s;ides, the <HI>Weymouth Pine,</HI> which is the talle&s;t &s;pecies in America&mdash;the <HI>Silver Fir,</HI> &s;o called from the &s;ilvery hue of its foliage&mdash;the <HI>Pina&s;ter</HI>&mdash;and a tree of ancient fame, the <HI>Cedar of Lebanon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that is a very great tree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It grows to a large &s;ize,
<PB N="68" REF="73">
but is very &s;low in coming to its full growth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are Pines and Firs very u&s;eful trees?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps the mo&s;t &s;o of any. By much the greate&s;t part of the wood u&s;ed among us comes from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What&mdash;more than from the Oak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, much more. Almo&s;t all the timber u&s;ed in building hou&s;es, for floors, beams, rafters, and roofs, is Fir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it all grow in this coun|try?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Scarcely any of it. Norway, Sweden, and Ru&s;&s;ia, are the countries from which we draw our timber, and a va&s;t trade there is in it. You have &s;een timber yards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes&mdash;&s;everal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>In them you would ob&s;erve &s;ome very long thick beams, called <HI>balks.</HI> Tho&s;e are whole trees, only &s;tripped of the bark and &s;quared. You
<PB N="69" REF="74">
would al&s;o &s;ee great piles of planks and boards, of different lengths and thick|ne&s;s. Tho&s;e are called <HI>deal,</HI> and are brought over ready &s;awn from the countries where they grow. They are of different colours. The white are chiefly from the Fir-tree; the yellow and red from the Pine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e there mu&s;t be great fore&s;ts of them in tho&s;e countries, or el&s;e they could not &s;end us &s;o much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. The mountains of Nor|way are overrun with them, enough for the &s;upply of all Europe; but on ac|count of their ruggedne&s;s and want of roads, it is found impo&s;&s;ible to get the trees when felled down to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, unle&s;s they grow near &s;ome river.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do they manage them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>They take the opportunity when the rivers are &s;welled with rains or melt|ed &s;now, and tumble the trees into them, when they are carried down to the
<PB N="70" REF="75">
mouths of the rivers, where they are &s;topped by a kind of pens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like to &s;ee them &s;wim|ming down the &s;tream.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;it would be curious enough; for in &s;ome places the&s;e tor|rents roll over rocks, making &s;teep wa|ter falls, down which the trees are car|ried headlong, and often do not ri&s;e again till they are got to a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance; and many of them are broken and torn to pieces in the pa&s;&s;|age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are the&s;e woods u&s;ed for any thing be&s;ides building?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>For a variety of purpo&s;es; &s;uch as boxes, trunks, packing-ca&s;es, pales, wain&s;cots, and the like. Deal is a very &s;oft wood, ea&s;ily worked, light and cheap, which makes it preferred for &s;o many u&s;es, though it is not very durable, and is very liable to &s;plit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;I know my box is made
<PB N="71" REF="76">
of deal, and the lid is &s;plit all to pieces with driving nails into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are &s;hips ever built with Fir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was one of the fir&s;t woods made u&s;e of for naval purpo&s;es; and in the poets you will find the words <HI>Pine</HI> and <HI>Fir</HI> frequently employed to &s;ignify <HI>&s;hip.</HI> But as navigation has improved, the &s;tronger and more durable woods have generally taken its place. How|ever, in the countries where Fir is very plentiful, large &s;hips are &s;till built with it; for though they la&s;t but a &s;hort time, they co&s;t &s;o little in proportion, that the profit of a few voyages is &s;ufficient. Then, from the great lightne&s;s of the wood, they &s;wim higher in the water, and con&s;equently will bear more load|ing. Mo&s;t of the large &s;hips that bring timber from Archangel in Ru&s;&s;ia are built of Fir. As for the ma&s;ts of &s;hips, tho&s;e I have already told you are all made of Fir or Pine, on account of their &s;traightne&s;s and lightne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="72" REF="77">
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there not &s;ome lines in Milton's <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> about that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes. The &s;pear of Satan is magnified by a compari&s;on with a lofty Pine.</P>
<Q><L>His &s;pear, to equal which the talle&s;t Pine</L>
<L>Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the ma&s;t</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, too, that the walk|ing &s;taff of the giant Polypheme was a Pine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay&mdash;&s;o Virgil and Ovid tell us; and he mu&s;t have been a giant indeed, to u&s;e &s;uch a &s;tick. Well, &s;o much for the wood of the&s;e trees. But I have more to &s;ay about their u&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>All of the tribe contain a juice of a bitteri&s;h ta&s;te and &s;trong fragrant &s;mell. This, in &s;ome, is &s;o abundant as to flow out from inci&s;ions; when it is called <HI>Tur|pentine.</HI> The larch, in particular, yields a large quantity. Turpentine is one of the
<PB N="73" REF="78">
&s;ub&s;tances called <HI>re&s;inous;</HI> it is &s;ticky, tran&s;parent, very inflammable, and will not mix with water, but will di&s;&s;olve in &s;pirits of wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it u&s;ed for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is u&s;ed medicinally, particu|larly in the compo&s;ition of pla&s;ters and ointments. It al&s;o is an ingredient in varni&s;hes, cements, and the like. An oil di&s;tilled from turpentine is employed in medicine, and is much u&s;ed by paint|ers for mixing up their colours. What remains after getting this oil, is com|mon <HI>ro&s;in.</HI> All the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances take fire very ea&s;ily, and burn with a great flame; and the wood of the Pine has &s;o much of this quality, when dry, that it has been u&s;ed in many countries for torches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know deal &s;havings burn very bri&s;kly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and matches are made of bits of deal dipped in brim&s;tone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>True;&mdash;and when it was the
<PB N="74" REF="79">
cu&s;tom to burn the bodies of the dead, as you read in Homer and other old au|thors, the pines and pitch-trees com|po&s;ed great part of the funeral pile.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are pitch-trees? Does pitch grow upon trees?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was going on to tell you about that. <HI>Tar</HI> is a product of the trees of this kind, e&s;pecially of one &s;pecies, call|ed the Pitch-pine. The wood is burn|ed in a &s;ort of oven made in the earth, and the re&s;inous juice &s;weats out, and acquires a peculiar ta&s;te and a black co|lour from the fire. This is <HI>tar.</HI> Tar when boiled down to dryne&s;s becomes <HI>pitch.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tar and pitch are chiefly u&s;ed about &s;hips; are they not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>They re&s;i&s;t moi&s;ture, and there|fore are of great &s;ervice in preventing things from decaying that are expo&s;ed to wet. For this rea&s;on, the cables and other ropes of &s;hips are well &s;oaked with tar; and the &s;ides of &s;hips are covered
<PB N="75" REF="80">
with pitch mixed with other ingredients. Their &s;eams, too, or the places where the planks join, are filled with tow dip|ped in a compo&s;ition of ro&s;in, tallow, and pitch, to keep out the water. Wood for paling, for piles, coverings of roofs, and other purpo&s;es of the like nature, are often tarred over. Ci&s;terns and ca&s;ks are pitched to prevent leaking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are &s;heep tarred for, after they are &s;heared?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>To cure wounds and &s;ores in their &s;kin. For the like purpo&s;es, an ointment made with tar is often rubbed upon children's heads. Several parts of the Pine are medicinal. The tops and green cones of the Spruce Fir are brewed with malt, and the liquor, call|ed <HI>&s;pruce-beer,</HI> is much drunk in Ame|rica, particularly for the &s;curvy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it plea&s;ant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to tho&s;e who are unaccu&s;|tomed to it. Well&mdash;I have now fini&s;h|ed my le&s;&s;on, &s;o let us walk.</P>

about among the boughs. Pray, are not Rooks the &s;ame with crows?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are a &s;pecies of crow; but they differ from the carrion crow and raven in not living upon dead fle&s;h, but upon corn and other &s;eeds, and gra&s;s. They indeed pick up beetles and other in&s;ects, and worms. See, what a num|ber of them have lighted on yonder ploughed field, almo&s;t blackening it over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they doing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>Searching for grubs and worms. You &s;ee the men in the field do not mole&s;t them, for they do a great deal of &s;ervice by de&s;troying grubs, which, if they were &s;uffered to grow to winged in&s;ects, would do much mi&s;|chief to the trees and plants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do they not hurt the corn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;they tear up a good deal of green corn, if they are not driven away. But upon the whole, Rooks are reckoned the farmer's friends; and they
<PB N="78" REF="83">
do not choo&s;e to have them de&s;troy|ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do all Rooks live in Rookeries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the general nature of them to a&s;&s;ociate together, and build in numbers on the &s;ame or adjoining trees. But this is often in the mid&s;t of woods or natural groves. However, they have no objection to the neighbourhood of man, but readily take to a plantation of tall trees, though it be clo&s;e to a hou&s;e; and this is commonly called a Rookery. They will even fix their habitations on trees in the mid&s;t of towns; and I have &s;een a Rookery in a churchyard in one of the clo&s;e&s;t parts of London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think a Rookery is a &s;ort of town it&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is:&mdash;a village in the air, peopled with numerous inhabitants; and nothing can be more amu&s;ing than to view them all in motion, flying to and fro, and bu&s;ied in their &s;everal occupa|tions. The &s;pring is their bu&s;ie&s;t time.
<PB N="79" REF="84">
Early in the year they begin to repair their ne&s;ts, or build new ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do they all work together, or every one for it&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>Each pair, after they have coupled, builds its own ne&s;t; and in&s;tead of helping, they are very apt to &s;teal the materials from one another. If both birds go out at once in &s;earch of &s;ticks, they often find, at their return, the work all de&s;troyed, and the materials carried off; &s;o that one of them generally &s;tays at home to keep watch. However, I have met with a &s;tory which &s;hows that they are not without &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the criminality of thieving. There was in a Rookery a lazy pair of Rooks, who never went out to get &s;ticks for them|&s;elves, but made a practice of watching when their neighbours were abroad, and helped them&s;elves from their ne&s;ts. They had &s;erved mo&s;t of the commu|nity in this manner, and by the&s;e means had ju&s;t fini&s;hed their own ne&s;t; when
<PB N="80" REF="85">
all the other Rooks in a rage fell upon them at once, pulled their ne&s;t in pieces, beat them &s;oundly, and drove them from their &s;ociety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very right&mdash;I &s;hould have liked to have &s;een it. But why do they live together, if they do not help one another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>They probably receive plea|&s;ure from the company of their own kind, as men and various other crea|tures do. Then, though they do not a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in building, they are mutually &s;erviceable in many ways. If a large bird of prey hovers about a Rookery for the purpo&s;e of carrying off any of the young ones, they all unite to drive him away. When they are feed|ing in a flock, &s;everal are placed as cen|tinels upon the trees all round, who give the alarm if any danger approaches. They often go a long way from home to feed; but every evening the whole flock returns, making a loud cawing as
<PB N="81" REF="86">
they fly, as if to direct and call in the &s;tragglers. The older Rooks take the lead: you may di&s;tingui&s;h them by the whitene&s;s of their bills, occa&s;ioned by their frequent digging in the ground, by which the black feathers at the root of the bill are worn off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do Rooks always keep to the &s;ame trees?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;they are much attach|ed to them; and when the trees happen to be cut down, they &s;eem greatly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, and keep hovering about them as they are falling, and will &s;carce|ly de&s;ert them when they lie on the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor things! I &s;uppo&s;e they feel as we &s;hould if our town was burned down or overthrown by an earthquake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt! The &s;ocieties of animals greatly re&s;emble tho&s;e of man; and that of Rooks is like tho&s;e of men in a &s;avage &s;tate, &s;uch as the communi|ties of the North American Indians. It
<PB N="82" REF="87">
is a &s;ort of league for mutual aid and de|fence, but in which every one is left to do as he plea&s;es, without any obligation to employ him&s;elf for the whole body. Others unite in a manner re&s;embling more civilized &s;ocieties of men. This is the ca&s;e with the beavers. They perform great public works by the unit|ed efforts of the whole community, &s;uch as damming up &s;treams, and con&s;truct|ing mounds for their habitations. As the&s;e are works of great art and labour, &s;ome of them mu&s;t probably act under the direction of others, and be compelled to work whether they will or not. Ma|ny curious &s;tories are told to this pur|po&s;e by tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved them in their remote&s;t haunts, where they ex|erci&s;e their full &s;agacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are they all true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. St.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is more than I can an|&s;wer for; yet what we certainly know of the economy of bees may ju&s;tify us in believing extraordinary things of the &s;a|gacity
<PB N="83" REF="88">

They not only inhabit a common dwelling, and perform great works in common, but they lay up a &s;tore of provi&s;ion which is the property of the whole community, and is not u&s;ed except at certain &s;ea&s;ons and under certain regulations. A bee-hive is a true image of a commonwealth, where no member acts for him&s;elf alone, but for the whole body.</P>

<P>Yes&mdash;and at the approach of winter they are driven out of the hive, and left to peri&s;h with cold and hunger. But I have not lei&s;ure at pre|&s;ent to tell you more about bees.

<P>That's very true, but all things are not equally nece&s;&s;ary to every one; but &s;ome that are very fit for one, are &s;carcely proper at all for others.</P>

<P>Why, mamma?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e, my dear, it is the pur|po&s;e of all education to fit per&s;ons for the &s;tation in which they are hereafter to live; and you know there are very great differences in that re&s;pect, both among men and women.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and do you think the wives and daughters of all the&s;e per&s;ons can have ju&s;t the &s;ame things to do, and the &s;ame duties to perform? You know how I &s;pend my time. I have to go to market and provide for the family, to look after the &s;ervants, to help in tak|ing care of you children, and in teach|ing you, to &s;ee that your clothes are in proper condition, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in mak|ing and mending for my&s;elf, and you, and your papa. All this is my nece&s;&s;ary duty; and be&s;ides this, I mu&s;t go out a vi&s;iting to keep up our acquaintance; this I call partly bu&s;ine&s;s, and partly amu&s;ement. Then when I am tired, and have done all that I think nece&s;&s;ary, I may amu&s;e my&s;elf with reading, or in any other proper way. Now a great

many of the&s;e employments do not be|long to Lady Wealthy, or Mrs. Rich, who keep hou&s;ekeepers and governe&s;&s;es, and &s;ervants of all kinds, to do every thing for them.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some are to teach you your duty to your Maker, and your fellow crea|tures, of which I hope you are &s;en&s;ible you ought not to be ignorant. Then it is very right to be acquainted with geo|graphy; for you remember how poor Mi&s;s Blunder was laughed at for &s;aying that if &s;he ever went to France, it &s;hould be by land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was becau&s;e England is an i&s;land, and all &s;urrounded with water, was not it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Great Britain, which con|tains both England and Scotland, is an i&s;land. Well, it is very u&s;eful to know &s;omething of the nature of plants, and animals, and minerals, becau&s;e we are always u&s;ing &s;ome or other of them. Something, too, of the heavenly bodies, is very proper to be known, both that
<PB N="92" REF="97">
we may admire the power and wi&s;dom of God in creating them, and that we may not make fooli&s;h mi&s;takes, when their motions and properties are the &s;ub|ject of conver&s;ation. The knowledge of hi&s;tory too, is very important, e&s;pe|cially that of our own country: and in &s;hort every thing that makes part of the di&s;cour&s;e of rational and well-educated people, ought in &s;ome degree to be &s;tu|died by every one who has proper op|portunities.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, I like &s;ome of tho&s;e things very well. But pray, mamma, what do I learn French for&mdash;am I ever to live in France?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Probably not, my dear; but there are a great many books written in French that are very well worth reading; and it may every now and then happen that you may be in company with foreigners who cannot &s;peak Engli&s;h, and as they almo&s;t all talk French, you may be able to conver&s;e with them in that language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="93" REF="98">
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I remember there was a gentleman here, that came from Ger|many, I think, and he could hardly talk a word of Engli&s;h, but papa and you could talk with him in French; and I wi&s;hed very much to be able to un|der&s;tand what you were &s;aying, for I be|lieve part of it was about me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was. Well then, you &s;ee the u&s;e of French. But I cannot &s;ay this is a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> part of knowledge to young women in general, only it is well worth acquiring, if a per&s;on has lei&s;ure and op|portunity. I will tell you, however, what is quite nece&s;&s;ary for one in your &s;tation, and that is, to write a good hand, and to ca&s;t accounts well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould like to write well, be|cau&s;e then I could &s;end letters to my friends when I plea&s;ed, and it would not be &s;uch a &s;crawl as our maid Betty writes, that I dare &s;ay her friends can hardly make out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had not the advantage of
<PB N="94" REF="99">
learning when young, for you know &s;he taught her&s;elf &s;ince &s;he came to us, which was a very &s;en&s;ible thing of her, and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will improve. Well, but accounts are almo&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary as writ|ing; for how could I ca&s;t up all the market bills, and trade&s;men's accounts, and keep my hou&s;e books without it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is the u&s;e of that, mam|ma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is of u&s;e to prevent our being overcharged in any thing, and to know exactly how much we &s;pend, and whe|ther or no we are exceeding our income, and in what articles we ought to be more &s;aving. Without keeping accounts, the riche&s;t man might &s;oon come to be ruin|ed before he knew his affairs were go|ing wrong?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do women always keep ac|counts? I thought that was generally the bu&s;ine&s;s of the men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is their bu&s;ine&s;s to keep the accounts belonging to their trade, or
<PB N="95" REF="100">
profe&s;&s;ion, or e&s;tate; but it is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of their wives to keep all the hou&s;e|hold accounts: and a woman almo&s;t in any rank, unle&s;s perhaps &s;ome of the highe&s;t of all, is to blame if &s;he does not take upon her this nece&s;&s;ary office. I remember a remarkable in&s;tance of the benefit which a young lady derived from an attention to this point. An eminent merchant in London failed for a great &s;um.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does that mean, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he owed a great deal more than he could pay. His creditors, that is tho&s;e to whom he was indebted, on examining his accounts found great de|ficiencies which they could not make out; for he had kept his books very irregularly, and had omitted to put down many things which he had bought and &s;old. They &s;u&s;pected, therefore, that great wa&s;te had been made in the family expences; and they were the more &s;u&s;|picious of this, as a daughter, who was
<PB N="96" REF="101">
a very genteel young lady, was his hou&s;ekeeper, his wife being dead. She was told of this; upon which, when the creditors were all met, &s;he &s;ent them her hou&s;e-books for their examination. They were all written in a very fair hand, and every &s;ingle article was en|tered with the greate&s;t regularity, and the &s;ums were all ca&s;t up with perfect exactne&s;s. The gentlemen were &s;o highly plea&s;ed with this proof of the young lady's ability, that they all agreed to make her a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent out of the effects; and one of the riche&s;t of them, who was in want of a clever wife, &s;oon after paid his addre&s;&s;es to her, and married her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very lucky, for I &s;up|po&s;e &s;he took care of her poor father, when &s;he was rich. But I &s;hall have nothing of that &s;ort to do a great while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but young women &s;hould keep their own accounts of clothes and
<PB N="97" REF="102">
pocket-money, and other expences, as I intend you &s;hall do when you grow up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am not I to learn dancing, and mu&s;ic, and drawing too, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dancing you &s;hall certainly learn pretty &s;oon, becau&s;e it is not only an agreeable accompli&s;hment in it&s;elf, but is u&s;eful in forming the body to ea&s;e and elegance in all its motions. As to the other two, they are merely ornamental ac|compli&s;hments, which though a woman of middling &s;tation may be admired for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, yet &s;he will never be cen&s;ured for being without. The propriety of at|tempting to acquire them mu&s;t depend on natural genius for them, and upon lei&s;ure and other accidental circum&s;tances. For &s;ome they are too expen&s;ive, and ma|ny are unable to make &s;uch progre&s;s in them as will repay the pains of be|ginning. It is &s;oon enough, however, for us to think about the&s;e things, and at any rate they are not to come in till
<PB N="98" REF="103">

<HEAD>THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.</HEAD>
<P>SOME days ago died GRIMALKIN, the favourite tabby Cat of <HI>Mrs. Petlove.</HI> Her di&s;order was a &s;hortne&s;s of breath, proceeding partly from old age, and partly from fat. As &s;he felt her end
<PB N="106" REF="111">
approaching, &s;he called her children to her, and with a good deal of difficulty &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>Before I depart from this world, my children, I mean, if my breath will give me leave, to relate to you the princi|pal events of my life, as the variety of &s;cenes I have gone through may afford you &s;ome u&s;eful in&s;truction for avoiding tho&s;e dangers to which our &s;pecies are particularly expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Without further preface, then, I was born at a farm-hou&s;e in a village &s;ome miles from hence; and almo&s;t as &s;oon as I came into the world, I was very near leaving it again. My mother brought five of us at a litter; and as the frugal people of the hou&s;e only kept Cats to be u&s;eful, and were already &s;ufficiently &s;tocked, we were immediately doomed to be drowned; and accordingly a boy was ordered to take us all and throw us into the hor&s;e-pond. This commi&s;&s;ion he performed with the plea&s;ure boys
<PB N="107" REF="112">
&s;eem naturally to take in acts of cruelty, and we were pre&s;ently &s;et a &s;wimming. While we were &s;truggling for life, a little girl, daughter to the farmer, came running to the pond &s;ide, and begged very hard that &s;he might &s;ave one of us, and bring it up for her own. After &s;ome di&s;pute, her reque&s;t was granted; and the boy, reaching out his arm, took hold of me, who was luckily neare&s;t him, and brought me out when I was ju&s;t &s;pent. I was laid on the gra&s;s, and it was &s;ome time before I re|covered. The girl then re&s;tored me to my mother, who was overjoyed to get again one of her little ones; and for fear of another mi&s;chance, &s;he took me in her mouth to a dark hole, where &s;he kept me till I could &s;ee, and was able to run by her &s;ide. As &s;oon as I came to light again, my little mi&s;tre&s;s took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, and tended me very carefully. Her fondne&s;s, indeed, was &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, as &s;he pinched
<PB N="108" REF="113">
my &s;ides with carrying me, and once or twice hurt me a good deal by letting me fall. Soon, however, I became &s;trong and active, and played and gamboled all day long, to the great delight of my mi&s;tre&s;s and her companions.</P>
<P>At this time I had another narrow e&s;cape. A man brought into the hou&s;e a &s;trange dog, who had been taught to worry all the Cats that came in his way. My mother &s;lunk away at his entrance; but I, thinking, like a little fool as I was, that I was able to protect my|&s;elf, &s;taid on the floor, growling, and &s;etting up my back by way of defiance. The dog in&s;tantly ran at me, and before I could get my claws ready, &s;eized me with his mouth, and began to gripe and &s;hake me mo&s;t terribly. I &s;creamed out, and by good luck my mi&s;tre&s;s was with|in hearing. She ran to us, but was not able to di&s;engage me; however, a &s;er|vant, &s;eeing her di&s;tre&s;s, took a great &s;tick, and gave the dog &s;uch a bang on
<PB N="109" REF="114">
the back, that he was forced to let me go. He had u&s;ed me &s;o roughly, that I was not able to &s;tand for &s;ome time; but by care and a good con&s;titution I recovered.</P>
<P>I was now running after every body's heels, by which means I got one day locked up in the dairy. I was not &s;orry for this accident, thinking to fea&s;t upon the cream and other good things. But having climbed upon a &s;helf to get at a bowl of cream, I unluckily fell backwards into a large ve&s;&s;el of butter|milk, where I &s;hould probably have been drowned, had not the maid heard the noi&s;e, and come to &s;ee what was the matter. She took me out, &s;colding bit|terly at me, and after making me undergo a &s;evere di&s;cipline at the pump to clean me, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with a good whip|ping. I took care never to follow her into the dairy again.</P>
<P>After a while I began to get into the yard, and my mother took me into the
<PB N="110" REF="115">
barn upon a mou&s;ing expedition. I &s;hall never forget the plea&s;ure this gave me. We &s;at by a hole, and pre&s;ently out came a mou&s;e with a brood of young ones. My mother darted among them, and fir&s;t demoli&s;hed the old one, and then pur&s;ued the little ones, who ran about &s;queaking in dreadful perplexity. I now thought it was time for me to do &s;omething, and accordingly ran after a &s;traggler, and &s;oon overtook it. Oh, how proud was I, as I &s;tood over my trembling captive, and patted him with my paws! My pride, however, &s;oon met with a check; for &s;eeing one day a large rat, I courageou&s;ly flew at him; but in&s;tead of turning tail, he gave me &s;uch a bite on the no&s;e, that I ran away to my mother, mewing piteou&s;ly, with my face all bloody and &s;welled. For &s;ome time I did not meddle with rats again; but at length, growing &s;tronger and more &s;kilful, I feared neither rats nor any other vermin, and
<PB N="111" REF="116">
acquired the reputation of an excellent hunter.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome other e&s;capes about this time. once I happened to meet with &s;ome poi&s;oned food laid for the rats, and eating it, I was thrown into a di&s;order that was very near killing me. At another time, I chanced to &s;et my foot in a rat|trap, and received &s;o many deep wounds from its teeth, that though I was loo&s;en|ed as gently as po&s;&s;ible by the people who heard me cry, I was rendered lame for &s;ome weeks after.</P>
<P>Time went on, and I arrived at my full growth; and forming an acquaint|ance with a he-cat about my age, after a decent re&s;i&s;tance by &s;colding, biting, and &s;cratching, we made a match of it. I became a mother in due time, and had the mortification of &s;eeing &s;everal broods of my kittens di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;ame manner as my brothers and &s;i&s;ters had been. I &s;hall mention two or three other adventures in the order I remem|ber
<PB N="112" REF="117">
them. I was once prowling for birds along a hedge at &s;ome di&s;tance from home, when the &s;quire's grey|hounds came that way a cour&s;ing. As &s;oon as they &s;pied me, they &s;et off full &s;peed, and running much fa&s;ter than I could do, were ju&s;t at my tail, when I reached a tree, and &s;aved my&s;elf by climbing up it. But a greater danger befell me on meeting with a parcel of boys returning from &s;chool. They &s;ur|rounded me before I was aware, and obliged me to take refuge in a tree: but I &s;oon found that a poor defence again&s;t &s;uch enemies; for they a&s;&s;em|bled about it, and threw &s;tones on all &s;ides, &s;o that I could not avoid receiv|ing many hard blows, one of which brought me &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. The bigge&s;t boy now &s;eized me, and propo&s;ed to the re&s;t making what he call|ed rare &s;port with me. This &s;port was to tie me on a board, and launching me on a pond, to &s;et &s;ome water-dogs at me,
<PB N="113" REF="118">
who were to duck and half drown me, while I was to defend my&s;elf by biting their no&s;es, and &s;cratching their eyes. Already was I bound, and ju&s;t ready to be &s;et a &s;ailing, when the &s;choolma&s;ter, taking a walk that way, and &s;eeing the bu&s;tle, came up, and obliged the boys to &s;et me at liberty, &s;everely reprimand|ing them for their cruel intentions.</P>
<P>The next remarkable incident of my life was the occa&s;ion of my removal from the country. My mi&s;tre&s;s's bro|ther had a tame linnet, of which he was very fond; for it would come and light on his &s;houlder when he called it, and feed out of his hand; and it &s;ung well be&s;ides. This bird was u&s;ually either in his cage or upon a high perch; but one unlucky day, when he and I were alone in the room together, he came down on the table to pick up crumbs. I &s;pied him, and not being able to re&s;i&s;t the temptation, &s;prung at him, and catching him in my claws, &s;oon began
<PB N="114" REF="119">
to devour him. I had almo&s;t fini&s;hed when his ma&s;ter came into the room; and &s;eeing me with the remains of poor linnet in my mouth, he ran to me in the greate&s;t fury, and after cha&s;ing me &s;e|veral times round the room, at length caught me. He was proceeding in|&s;tantly to hang me, when his &s;i&s;ter, by many entreaties and tears, per&s;uaded him after a good whipping to forgive me, upon the promi&s;e that I &s;hould be &s;ent away. Accordingly, the next market|day I was di&s;patched in the cart to a re|lation's of theirs in this town, who want|ed a good Cat, as the hou&s;e was over|run with mice.</P>
<P>In the &s;ervice of this family I conti|nued a good while, performing my duty as a mou&s;er extremely well, &s;o that I was in high e&s;teem. I &s;oon became acquainted with all the particulars of a town life, and di&s;tingui&s;hed my activity in climbing up walls and hou&s;es, and jumping from roof to roof, either in
<PB N="115" REF="120">
pur&s;uit of prey, or upon go&s;&s;ipping par|ties with my companions. Once, how|ever, I had like to have &s;uffered for my venturing; for having made a great jump from one hou&s;e to another, I lit upon a loo&s;e tile, which giving way with me, I fell from a va&s;t height into the &s;treet, and &s;hould certainly have been killed, had I not had the luck to light in a dung-cart, whence I e&s;caped with no other injury but being half &s;tifled with filth.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the danger I had run from killing the linnet, I am &s;orry to confe&s;s that I was again guilty of a &s;i|milar offence. I contrived one night to leap down from a roof upon the board of &s;ome pigeon-holes, which led to a garret inhabited by tho&s;e birds. I en|tered, and finding them a&s;leep, made &s;ad havock among all that were within my reach, killing and &s;ucking the blood of near a dozen. I was near paying dearly for this, too; for on attempting
<PB N="116" REF="121">
to return, I found it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to leap up again to the place from whence I had de&s;cended, &s;o that after &s;everal dangerous trials, I was obliged to wait trembling in the place where I had committed all the&s;e murders, till the owner came up in the morning to feed his pigeons. I ru&s;hed out between his legs as &s;oon as the door was opened, and had the good fortune to get &s;afe down &s;tairs, and make my e&s;cape through a window unknown; but ne|ver &s;hall I forget the horrors I felt that night! Let my double danger be a warning to you, my children, to con|troul your &s;avage appetites, and on no account to do harm to tho&s;e creatures which like our&s;elves are under the pro|tection of man. We Cats all lie under a bad name for treacherous di&s;po&s;itions in this re&s;pect, and with &s;hame I mu&s;t acknowledge it is but too well merited.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;but my breath begins to fail me, and I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion.
<PB N="117" REF="122">
I &s;till lived in the &s;ame family, when our pre&s;ent kind mi&s;tre&s;s, Mrs. Petlove, having lo&s;t a favourite tabby, adverti&s;ed a very hand&s;ome price for another that &s;hould as nearly as po&s;&s;ible re&s;emble her dead darling. My owners, tempted by the offer, took me for the good lady's in&s;pection, and I had the honour of be|ing preferred to a multitude of rivals. I was immediately &s;ettled in the com|fortable man&s;ion we now inhabit, and had many favours and indulgencies be|&s;towed upon me, &s;uch as I had never before experienced. Among the&s;e I reckon one of the principal, that of be|ing allowed to rear all my children, and to &s;ee them grow up in peace and plenty. My adventures here have been few; for after the monkey had &s;pitefully bit off the la&s;t joint of my tail (for which I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him &s;oundly corrected) I kept beyond the length of his chain; and neither the parrot nor lap-dogs ever dared to mole&s;t me. One
<PB N="118" REF="123">
of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e&s;t afflictions I have felt here, was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing or a whole litter of my kittens by a fat old lady, a friend of my mi&s;tre&s;s's, who fat down on the chair where they lay, and never perceived the mi&s;chief &s;he was doing till &s;he ro&s;e, though I pulled her clothes, and u&s;ed all the means in my power to &s;hew my unea&s;ine&s;s. This misfortune my mi&s;|tre&s;s took to heart almo&s;t as much as my&s;elf, and the lady has never &s;ince en|tered our doors. Indeed, both I and mine have ever been treated here with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s&mdash;perhaps with too much; for to the pampering me with delicacies, together with Mrs. Abigail's frequent wa&s;hings, I attribute this a&s;th|ma, which is now putting an end to my life, rather &s;ooner than its natural period. But I know all was meant well; and with my la&s;t breath I charge you all to &s;hew your gratitude to our worthy mi&s;|tre&s;s, by every return in your power.</P>
<P>And now, my dear children, farewel;
<PB N="119" REF="124">
we &s;hall perhaps meet again in a land where there are no dogs to worry us, or boys to torment us&mdash;Adieu!</P>
<P>Having thus &s;aid, Grimalkin became &s;peechle&s;s, and pre&s;ently departed this life, to the great grief of all the family.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"WHAT &s;hall I do,"</Q> &s;aid a very lit|tle Dog one day to his mother, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;hew my gratitude to our good ma&s;ter, and make my&s;elf of &s;ome value to him? I cannot draw or carry burdens, like the hor&s;e; nor give him milk, like the cow; nor lend him my covering for his clothing, like the &s;heep; nor produce him eggs, like the poultry; nor catch mice and rats &s;o well as the cat. I can|not divert him with &s;inging, like the ca|naries
<PB N="120" REF="125">
and linnets; nor can I defend him again&s;t robbers, like our relation Tow|zer. I &s;hould not be of u&s;e to him even if I were dead, as the hogs are. I am a poor in&s;ignificant creature, not worth the co&s;t of keeping; and I don't &s;ee that I can do a &s;ingle thing to entitle me to his regard."</Q> So &s;aying, the poor little Dog hung down his head in &s;ilent de&s;pondency.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear child,"</Q> replied his mo|ther, <Q REND="inline">"though your abilities are but &s;mall, yet a hearty good-will is &s;ufficient to &s;upply all defects. Do but love him dearly, and prove your love by all the means in your power, and you will not fail to plea&s;e him."</Q></P>
<P>The little Dog was comforted with this a&s;&s;urance; and on his ma&s;ter's ap|proach, ran to him, licked his feet, gamboled before him, and every now and then &s;topped, wagging his tail, and looking up to his ma&s;ter with expre&s;|&s;ions of the mo&s;t humble and affec|tionate
<PB N="121" REF="126">
attachment. The ma&s;ter ob&s;erv|ed him. Ha! little Fido, &s;aid he, you are an hone&s;t, good-natured little fel|low!&mdash;and &s;tooped down to pat his head. Poor Fido was ready to go out of his wits with joy.</P>
<P>Fido was now his ma&s;ter's con&s;tant companion in his walks, playing and &s;kipping round him, and amu&s;ing him by a thou&s;and &s;portive tricks. He took care, however, not to be trouble&s;ome by leaping on him with dirty paws, nor would he follow him into the parlour, unle&s;s invited. He al&s;o attempted to make him&s;elf u&s;eful by a number of lit|tle &s;ervices. He would drive away the &s;parrows as they were &s;tealing the chickens' meat; and would run and bark with the utmo&s;t fury at any &s;trange pigs or other animals that offered to come into the yard. He kept the poultry, gee&s;e, and pigs from &s;traying beyond their bounds, and particu|larly from doing mi&s;chief in the gar|den.
<PB N="122" REF="127">
He was always ready to alarm Towzer if there was any &s;u&s;picious noi&s;e about the hou&s;e, day or night. If his ma&s;ter pulled off his coat in the field to help his workmen, as he would &s;ometimes do, Fido always &s;at by it, and would not &s;uffer either man or bea&s;t to touch it. By this means he came to be con&s;idered as a very tru&s;ty protector of his ma&s;ter's property.</P>
<P>His ma&s;ter was once confined to his bed with a dangerous illne&s;s. Fido planted him&s;elf at the chamber door, and could not be per&s;uaded to leave it, even to take food; and as &s;oon as his ma&s;ter was &s;o far recovered as to &s;it up, Fido, being admitted into the room, ran up to him with &s;uch marks of ex|ce&s;&s;ive joy and affection, as would have melted any heart to behold. This cir|cum&s;tance wonderfully endeared him to his ma&s;ter; and &s;ome time after he had an opportunity of doing him a very im|portant &s;ervice. One hot day after din|ner,
<PB N="123" REF="128">
his ma&s;ter was &s;leeping in a &s;um|mer-hou&s;e, with Fido by his &s;ide. The building was old and crazy; and the Dog, who was faithfully watching his ma&s;ter, perceived the walls &s;hake, and pieces of mortar fall from the ceiling. He comprehended the danger, and be|gan barking to awake his ma&s;ter; and this not &s;ufficing, he jumped up, and gently bit his finger. The ma&s;ter, upon this, &s;tarted up, and had ju&s;t time to get out of the door before the whole building fell down. Fido, who was behind, got hurt by &s;ome rubbi&s;h which fell upon him; on which his ma&s;ter had him taken care of with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s, and ever after acknowledged his obligation to this little animal as the pre&s;erver of his life. Thus his love and fidelity had their full reward.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE MARTIN.</HEAD>
<P>LOCK up, my dear (&s;aid his papa to little <HI>William</HI>), at tho&s;e bird-ne&s;ts above the chamber-windows, beneath the eaves of the hou&s;e. Some, you &s;ee, are but ju&s;t begun,&mdash;nothing but a little clay &s;tuck again&s;t the wall. Others are half fini&s;hed; and others are quite built&mdash;clo&s;e and tight&mdash;leaving nothing but a &s;mall hole for the birds to come in and go out at.</P>
<P>What ne&s;ts are they? &s;aid William.</P>
<P>Thy are Martin's ne&s;ts, replied his father; and there you &s;ee the owners. How bu&s;ily they fly backwards and for|wards, bringing clay and dirt in their bills, and laying it upon their work,
<PB N="129" REF="134">
forming it into &s;hape with their bills and feet! The ne&s;ts are built very &s;trong and thick, like a mud wall, and are lined with feathers, to make a &s;oft bed for the young. Martins are a kind of &s;wallows. They feed on flies, gnats, and other in&s;ects; and always build in towns and villages about the hou&s;es. People do not mole&s;t them, for they do good rather than harm, and it is very amu&s;|ing to view their manners and actions. See how &s;wiftly they &s;kim through the air in pur&s;uit of their prey! In the morn|ing they are up by day-break, and twit|ter about your window while you are a&s;leep in bed; and all day long they are upon the wing, getting food for them|&s;elves and their young. As &s;oon as they have caught a few flies, they ha&s;ten to their ne&s;ts, pop into the hole, and feed their little ones. I'll tell you a &s;tory about the great care they take of their young. A pair of Martins once built their ne&s;t in a porch; and when they

had young ones, it happened that one of them climbing up to the hole before he was fledged, fell out, and lighting upon the &s;tones, was killed. The old birds, perceiving this accident, went and got &s;hort bits of &s;trong &s;traw, and &s;tuck them with mud, like pali&s;ades, all round the hole of the ne&s;t, in order to keep the other little ones from tum|bling after their poor brother.</P>
<P>How cunning that was! cried Wil|liam.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid his father; and I can tell you another &s;tory of their &s;agacity, and al&s;o of their di&s;po&s;ition to help one an|other. A &s;aucy cock-&s;parrow (you know what impudent rogues they are!) had got into a Martin's ne&s;t whil&s;t the owner was abroad; and when he re|turned, the &s;parrow put his head into the hole, and pecked at the Martin with open bill as he attempted to enter his own hou&s;e. The poor Martin was &s;ad|ly provoked at this inju&s;tice, but was
<PB N="131" REF="136">
unable by his own &s;trength to right him|&s;elf. So he flew away, and gathered a number of his companions, who all came with a bit of clay in their bills, with which they pla&s;tered up the hole of the ne&s;t; and kept the &s;parrow in pri&s;on, who died mi&s;erably for want of food and air.</P>
<P>He was rightly &s;erved, &s;aid Wil|liam.</P>
<P>So he was, rejoined papa. Well; I have more to &s;ay about the &s;agacity of the&s;e birds. In autumn, when it be|gins to be cold weather, the Martins and other &s;wallows a&s;&s;emble in great numbers upon the roofs of high build|ings, and prepare for their departure to a warmer country; for as all the in&s;ects here die in the winter, they would have nothing to live on if they were to &s;tay. They take &s;everal &s;hort flights in flocks, round and round, in order to try their &s;trength; and then, on &s;ome fine calm day, they &s;et out together for a long journey
<PB N="132" REF="137">
&s;outhwards, over &s;ea and land, to a very di&s;tant country.</P>
<P>But how do they find the way? &s;aid William.</P>
<P>We &s;ay, an&s;wered his father, that they are taught by <HI>in&s;tinct;</HI> that is, God has implanted in their minds a de|&s;ire of travelling at the &s;ea&s;on which he knows to be proper, and has al&s;o given them an impul&s;e to take the right road. They &s;teer their cour&s;e through the wide air, directly to the proper &s;pot. Some|times, however, &s;torms and contrary winds meet them, and drive the poor birds about till they are quite &s;pent, and fall into the &s;ea, unle&s;s they happen to meet with a &s;hip, on which they can light and re&s;t them&s;elves. The &s;wal|lows from this country are &s;uppo&s;ed to go as far as the middle of Africa to &s;pend the winter, where the weather is always warm, and in&s;ects are to be met with all the year. In &s;pring they take another long journey back again to the&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="138">
northern countries. Sometimes, when we have fine weather very early, a few of them come too &s;oon; for when it changes to fro&s;t and &s;now again, the poor creatures are &s;tarved for want of food, or peri&s;hed with the cold. Hence ari&s;es the proverb,<Q>One &s;wallow does not make a &s;ummer.</Q> But when a great many of them are come, we may be &s;ure that winter is over; &s;o that we are always very glad to &s;ee them again. The Martins find their way back over &s;uch a va&s;t length of &s;ea and land, to the very &s;ame villages and hou&s;es where they were bred. This has been di&s;covered by catching &s;ome of them, and marking them. They repair their old ne&s;ts, or build new ones, and then &s;et about laying eggs and hatching their young. Pretty things!

<HEAD>THE SHIP.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Charles O&s;born,</HI> when at home in the holidays, had a vi&s;it from a &s;chool-fel|low who was ju&s;t entered as a mid&s;hip|man on board a man of war. <HI>Tom Hardy</HI> (that was his name) was a free|hearted &s;pirited lad, and a favourite among his companions; but he never liked his book, and had left &s;chool ig|norant of almo&s;t every thing he came there to learn. What was wor&s;e, he had got a contempt for learning of all kinds, and was fond of &s;howing it. <Q REND="inline">"What does your father mean,"</Q> &s;ays he to Charles, <Q REND="inline">"to keep you moping and &s;tudying over things of no u&s;e in the world but to plague folks?&mdash;Why can't you go into his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice,

like me, and be made a gentleman of? You are old enough, and I know you are a lad of &s;pirit."</Q> This kind of talk made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon young <HI>O&s;|born.</HI> He became le&s;s attentive to the le&s;&s;ons his father &s;et him, and le&s;s will|ing to enter into in&s;tructive conver&s;a|tion. This change gave his father much concern; but as he knew the cau&s;e, he thought it be&s;t, in&s;tead of employing direct authority, to attempt to give a new impre&s;&s;ion to his &s;on's mind, which might counteract the effects of his com|panion's &s;ugge&s;tions.</P>
<P>Being acquainted with an Ea&s;t India captain who was on the point of &s;ailing, he went with his &s;on to pay him a fare|wel vi&s;it on board his &s;hip. They were &s;hewn all about the ve&s;&s;el, and viewed all the preparations for &s;o long a voyage. They &s;aw her weigh anchor and unfurl her &s;ails; and they took leave of their friend amid the &s;houts of the &s;eamen and all the bu&s;tle of departure.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="141">
<HI>Charles</HI> was highly delighted with this &s;cene; and as they were returning, could think and talk of nothing el&s;e. It was ea&s;y, therefore, for his father to lead him into the following train of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After <HI>Charles</HI> had been warmly ex|pre&s;&s;ing his admiration of the grand &s;ight of a large &s;hip completely fitted out and getting under &s;ail;&mdash;I do not wonder (&s;aid his father) that you are &s;o much &s;truck with it:&mdash;it is, in reality, one of the fine&s;t &s;pectacles created by human &s;kill, and the noble&s;t triumph of art over untaught nature. Near two thou&s;and years ago, when Julius Cae&s;ar came over to this i&s;land, he found the na|tives in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no other kind of ve&s;|&s;el than a &s;ort of canoe, formed of wicker work covered with hides, and no bigger than a man or two could carry. But the large&s;t &s;hip in Cae&s;ar's fleet was not more &s;uperior to the&s;e, than the India|diaman you have been &s;eeing is to what that was. Our &s;avage ance&s;tors ven|tured
<PB N="137" REF="142">
only to paddle along the rivers and coa&s;ts, or cro&s;s &s;mall arms of the &s;ea in calm weather; and Cae&s;ar him&s;elf would have been alarmed to be a few days out of &s;ight of land. But the &s;hip we have ju&s;t left is going by it&s;elf to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the globe, prepared to encounter the tempe&s;tuous winds and mountanous waves of the va&s;t &s;outhern ocean, and to find its way to its de&s;tined port, though many weeks mu&s;t pa&s;s with nothing in view but &s;ea and &s;ky. Now, what do you think can be the cau&s;e of this prodigious difference in the powers of man at one period and another?</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> was &s;ilent.</P>

<P>In order with certainty to pro|duce the&s;e effects, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy proportions very exactly, and to lay down an accurate &s;cale by mathe|matical lines and figures after which to build the &s;hip. Much has been writ|ten upon this &s;ubject, and nice calcu|lations have been made of the re&s;i&s;t|ance a &s;hip meets with in making way through the water, and the be&s;t means of overcoming it; al&s;o, of the action of the wind on the &s;ails, and their action in pu&s;hing on the &s;hip by means of the ma&s;ts.

<P>Very likely; but they have fol|lowed by rote the rules laid down by others; and as they work merely by imitation, they cannot alter and im|prove as occa&s;ion may require. Then, though common merchant &s;hips are tru&s;ted to &s;uch builders, yet in con|&s;tructing men of war and Indiamen, per|&s;ons of &s;cience are always employed.

</SP>

<P>Stop there, and reflect how ma|ny arts you have now &s;et to work. Gunpowder is one of the greate&s;t in|ventions of modern times, and what has given &s;uch a &s;uperiority to civili&s;ed na|tions over the barbarous. An Engli&s;h frigate &s;urrounded by the canoes of all the &s;avages in the world, would ea&s;ily beat them off by means of her guns;
<PB N="142" REF="147">
and if Cae&s;ar were to come again to Eng|land with his fleet, a battery of cannon would &s;ink all his &s;hips, and &s;et his le|gions a &s;wimming in the &s;ea. But the making of gunpowder, and the ca&s;ting of cannon, are arts that require an ex|act knowledge of the &s;cience of <HI>chemi&s;|try.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It comprehends the knowledge of all the properties of metals and mi|nerals, &s;alts, &s;ulphur, oils, and gums, and of the action of fire and water and air upon all &s;ub&s;tances, and the effects of mixing different things together. Gunpowder is a mixture of three things only, &s;altpetre or nitre, &s;ulphur of brim|&s;tone, and charcoal. But who could have thought &s;uch a wonderful effect would have been produced by it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it not fir&s;t di&s;covered by accident?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;but it was by one who

was making chemical experiments, and many more experiments have been em|ployed to bring it to perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But need a captain know how to make gunpowder and cannon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary, though it may often be u&s;eful to him. However, it is quite nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould know how to employ them. Now the &s;ci|ences of gunnery and fortification de|pend entirely upon mathematical prin|ciples; for by the&s;e are calculated the direction of a ball through the air, the di&s;tance it will reach to, and the force with which it will &s;trike any thing. All engineers, therefore, mu&s;t be good ma|thematicians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I think I have heard of gunners being little better than the com|mon men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;there is a way of doing that bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as many others, by mere practice; and an uneducated man may acquire &s;kill in pointing a
<PB N="144" REF="149">
cannon, as well as in &s;hooting with a common gun. But this is only in or|dinary ca&s;es, and an abler head is re|quired to direct. Well&mdash;now &s;uppo&s;e your &s;hip completely fitted out for &s;ea, and the wind blowing fair; how will you navigate her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would &s;pread the &s;ails, and &s;teer by the rudder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well&mdash;but how would you find your way to the port you were bound for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I cannot tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor perhaps can I make you ex|actly comprehend it; but I can &s;hew you enough to convince you that it is an af|fair that requires much knowledge, and early &s;tudy. In former times, when a ve&s;&s;el left the &s;ight of land, it was &s;teer|ed by ob&s;ervation of the &s;un by day, and the moon and &s;tars by night. The &s;un, you know, ri&s;es in the ea&s;t, and &s;ets in the we&s;t; and at noon, in the&s;e parts of the world, it is exactly &s;outh of
<PB N="145" REF="150">
us. The&s;e points, therefore, may be found out when the &s;un &s;hines. The moon and &s;tars vary; however, their place in the &s;ky may be known by ex|act ob&s;ervation. Then, there is one &s;tar that always points to the north pole, and is therefore called the pole-&s;tar. This was of great u&s;e in navigation, and the word pole-&s;tar is often u&s;ed by the poets to &s;ignify a &s;ure guide. Do you recollect the de&s;cription in Homer's Ody&s;&s;ey, when Uly&s;&s;es fails away by him&s;elf from the i&s;land of Calyp&s;o,&mdash;how he &s;teers by the &s;tars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well&mdash;they are fine lines indeed! You &s;ee, then, how long ago &s;ailors thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy a&s;tro|nomy. But as it frequently happens, e&s;pecially in &s;tormy weather, that the &s;tars are not to be &s;een, this method was &s;ubject to great uncertainty, which rendered it dangerous to undertake di&s;|tant voyages. At length, near 500 years &s;ince, a property was di&s;covered in a mineral, called the magnet or load|&s;tone, which removed the difficulty. This was, its <HI>polarity,</HI> or quality of al|ways pointing to the poles of the earth, that is, due north and &s;outh. This it can communicate to any piece of iron, &s;o that a needle well rubbed in a parti|cular manner by a load&s;tone, and then ba|lanced upon its centre &s;o as to turn round freely, will always point to the north. With an in&s;trument called a mariner's
<PB N="147" REF="152">
compa&s;s, made of one of the&s;e needles, and a card marked with all the points, north, &s;outh, ea&s;t, and we&s;t, and the di|vi&s;ions between the&s;e, a &s;hip may be &s;teered to any part of the globe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a very ea&s;y matter, then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not quite &s;o ea&s;y, neither. In a long voyage, cro&s;s or contrary winds blow a &s;hip out of her direct cour&s;e, &s;o that without nice calculations, both of the &s;traight tract &s;he has gone, and all the deviations from it, the &s;ailors would not know where they were, nor to what point to &s;teer. It is al&s;o frequently ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take ob&s;ervations, as they call it; that is, to ob&s;erve with an in&s;tru|ment where the &s;un's place in the &s;ky is at noon, by which they can determine the <HI>latitude</HI> they are in. Other ob&s;erva|tions are nece&s;&s;ary to determine their <HI>longitude.</HI> What the&s;e mean, I can &s;hew you upon the globe. It is enough now to &s;ay, that by means of both together, they can tell the exact &s;pot they are on
<PB N="148" REF="153">
at any time; and then, by con&s;ulting their map, and &s;etting their compa&s;s, they can &s;teer right to the place they want. But all this requires a very ex|act knowledge of a&s;tronomy, the u&s;e of the globes, mathematics, and arithmetic, which you may &s;uppo&s;e is not to be ac|quired without much &s;tudy. A great number of curious in&s;truments have been invented to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the&s;e operations; &s;o that there is &s;carcely any matter in which &s;o much art and &s;cience have been em|ployed, as in navigation; and none but a very learned and civilized nation can excel in it.</P>

<P>At midnight, ju&s;t as the clock &s;truck twelve; was it not, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really; it was on a fine bal|my &s;ummer's morning:&mdash;and moved forwards, one behind another....</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>As &s;till as death, creeping along under the hedges.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary&mdash;they walked remarkably upright; and &s;o far from endeavouring to be hu&s;hed and &s;till, they made a loud noi&s;e as they came along, with &s;everal &s;orts of in&s;truments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, they would be found out immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>They did not &s;eem to wi&s;h to con|ceal them&s;elves: on the contrary, they gloried in what they were about.&mdash;They moved forwards, I &s;ay, to a large plain,
<PB N="152" REF="157">

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fie! papa! You do not intend I &s;hould believe this! I thought all along you were making up a tale, as you often do; but you &s;hall not catch me this time. What! they lay &s;till, I &s;uppo&s;e, and let the&s;e fellows cut their throats!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, truly&mdash;they re&s;i&s;ted as long as they could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;hould the&s;e men kill twen|ty thou&s;and people, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? the <HI>murderers</HI> were thirty thou&s;and.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, now I have found you out! You mean a BATTLE.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do. I do not know of any <HI>murders</HI> half &s;o bloody.</P>
