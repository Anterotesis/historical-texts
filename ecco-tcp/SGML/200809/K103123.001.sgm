<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>RIDICULE we know has been too often applied with &s;ucce&s;s to the perver&s;ion of &s;erious things, and to the profanation of &s;acred: when it can be u&s;ed with effect to render vice and depravity more dete&s;table, it may be then con&s;idered as wearing its very be&s;t form. Many who are too volatile to attend to the
<PB REF="5">force of a grave argument, or to feel the weight of &s;erious deductions, are not incapable of reli&s;hing a je&s;t; and it amounts to the &s;ame thing in the end, whether men are rea|&s;oned or laughed into philan|thropy.</P>
<P>So many grave volumes have appeared upon the enor|mities of FRANCE, &s;ince the frenzy of Revolutions and Reformation &s;eized upon that unhappy Country, that an|other &s;ober di&s;&s;ertation would,
<PB REF="6">perhaps, rather add one more to the number of publications, than contribute any efficacy to a Writer's good intentions. At this time it &s;eems hardly nece&s;&s;ary to admoni&s;h think|ing men again&s;t e&s;pou&s;ing vi&s;ionary theories of political perfection in States; the de|plorable picture of FRANCE &s;peaks more eloquently than <Q>the &s;weet tongues of twenty orators.</Q> Of all mankind, the &s;ubjects of the&s;e happy I&s;lands &s;tand lea&s;t in need of &s;uch admonitions, yet are
<PB REF="7">there to be found among us &s;ome &s;pirits malevolent enough to cry out, with MII.TON'S LUCIFER in Paradi&s;e, <Q>Sight hateful! fight tormenting!</Q> and who &s;till manife&s;t a lurk|ing partiality for the glorious anarchy of our GALLIC Neigh|bours.</P>
<P>COULD we &s;uppo&s;e the Spi|rit of Evil had been permitted to produce the people of one particular nation, I think we &s;hould expect them to act ex|actly as the FRENCH have done;
<PB REF="8">with this difference only, that there would probably be a little more &s;en&s;e and con&s;i&s;tency in their wickedne&s;s. They would commit the &s;ame crimes, call them by the &s;ame names, var|ni&s;h them over with the &s;ame pretences, and be led by the &s;ame kind of champions. They would have their DANTON, their SANSTERRE, their MARAT, their ROBESPIERRE, their GOR|SAS, and their EGALITE. We &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear they had erected temples, and e&s;tabli&s;hed public wor|&s;hip
<PB REF="9">to the Prince of Dark|ne&s;s; and that the Devil was adored among them, not, as by the INDIANS, through fear, but from veneration.</P>
<P>IN the following pages the Reader will &s;ee the detail of much wickedne&s;s, and no ex|aggeration: the Author's diffi|culty was to invent up to the real atrocities of the Nation from which he has &s;elected his principal characters.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONFESSIONS OF <HI>JAMES BAPTIST COUTEAU,</HI> CITIZEN OF FRANCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MY PARENTAGE AND PERSON.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING always been a great admirer of the &s;amous JOHN JAMES ROUSSEAU, I decorate my work with the &s;ame title which he cho&s;e for a po&s;thumous publi|cation.
<PB N="2" REF="17">Though my name has not yet acquired equal celebrity with his in the Republic of Letters, I flat|ter my&s;elf, however, that my actions &s;urpa&s;s his, as much at lea&s;t as he is &s;uperior to me in genius and elo|quence.</P>
<P>AFTER all, what had ROUSSEAU to confe&s;s? Wretched trifles. The &s;tealing a ribbon ruining the hone&s;t character of a poor &s;ervant-maid, de|&s;erting a friend in his di&s;tre&s;s, and having de&s;iled the iron pot where Madam CLOT's dinner was boiling, and a few other peccadilloes, which tend rather to prove the ba&s;ene&s;s than the elevation of his mind. However, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that he was
<PB N="3" REF="18">a very great man. He doubted of the exi&s;tence of the Deity, and with his u&s;ual ingenuity of &s;ceptici&s;m has rai&s;ed &s;uch a mi&s;t about his notions of the Chri&s;tian per&s;ua&s;ion, that he has left the world in complete indeci&s;ion whe|ther he was a believer or an infidel. None of his actions, it is true, are at|tended with any &s;plendor; but to &s;uch principles as he and his a&s;&s;ociates in the &s;ame cau&s;e have di&s;&s;eminated, FRANCE is obliged for that glorious anarchy which prevails there at pre|&s;ent, and which probably will continue to prevail there to the la&s;t hour of her duration.</P>
<P>I DO not retrace my adventures in order to caution others again&s;t falling
<PB N="4" REF="19">into the &s;nares which are laid for in|nocence and &s;implicity, but to prove, that in the pre&s;ent age the way to honours and &s;elicity is open to all per|&s;ons who have &s;pirit, and who by the mere force of genius will venture to emancipate them&s;elves from vulgar prejudices: be&s;ides, I feel no &s;mall &s;atisfaction in con&s;idering that my re|putation and my merit will go hand in hand, and with an-equal pace, through the world together.</P>
<P>I WAS born at PARIS, in the &s;treet <HI>St. Marcel.</HI> My mother was a Fi&s;h|woman, ugly, poor, and di&s;gu&s;ting, but of a robu&s;t make, and well formed by nature to offer and to endure every &s;ort of violence. My &s;uppo&s;ed father
<PB N="5" REF="20">was a Butcher, and I go by the &s;ame Chri&s;tian names, though perhaps with|out the formality of any bapti&s;m.&mdash; But, to &s;ay truth, I have &s;ome doubts as to my filiation on the paternal &s;ide, for my mother's accounts were never as to that point entirely con&s;i&s;tent.&mdash; She imputed me at different times to almo&s;t every per&s;on in the neighbour|hood. Sometimes &s;he &s;aid I was her &s;on by a Shoe-cleaner, &s;ometimes by a Cobler in the Mar&s;h, &s;ometimes by one, and &s;ometimes by another, ju&s;t as it happened to &s;erve her turn to get a little money for her pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, by the recollection of the tender inti|macy and connection which had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between her and the uncertain author of my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="21">HAD it plea&s;ed Nature to have en|dowed me with great talents for Poe|try, as many fathers might have di&s;puted a right to my procreation as there were Cities of GREECE which contended for the birth of HOMER; but Fortune formed me rather to perform great exploits than to &s;ing them, and I can hardly expect that the &s;imple nar|rative following will ever be placed under the protection of an APOLLO PALATINUS.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to my Figure, I can give the Reader no idea more exact in general, than by a&s;&s;uring him, that as to it I am principally indebted for my pre&s;ent elevated &s;tation in life, it is &s;uch as never fails to rai&s;e &s;ome emotion of
<PB N="7" REF="22">terror in every per&s;on who happens to meet me. I am tall like my mother, my body remarkably &s;trong, and the cordage of my mu&s;cles &s;uch as arti&s;ts never fail to give to the Statue of HERCULES. My countenance is very &s;triking; for, be&s;ides a violent &s;quint, my complexion is of a dingy olive; my no&s;e like a Negro's; my teeth few in number, very long and black; red eye|brows; a wide mouth; and a chin &s;harp, and peaked almo&s;t to a point at the extremity: add to this, an abun|dance of rich purple carbuncles &s;trew|ed over my vi&s;age, with the mark of &s;everal deep &s;cars all con&s;picuous, and this a&s;&s;emblage gives you preci&s;ely my picture.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="23">MY di&s;po&s;ition accords perfectly with my out&s;ide, and a Phy&s;iognomi&s;t much inferior in penetration to LAVA|TER would not he&s;itate at the fir&s;t glance to pronounce upon the qualities of my mind. By the fervour of my con&s;titution, being extremely &s;u&s;cepti|ble of impre&s;&s;ions from Women, I &s;ought to be connected with them from nece&s;&s;ity, and not from that &s;ort of tender &s;ympathy about which one hears &s;o much, and of which I never could entertain the mo&s;t remote con|ception. My blood always impelled me, not my heart; when the warmth of the flame was cooled by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I generally con&s;idered the object with indifference&mdash;often, indeed, with di&s;|gu&s;t: plea&s;ures which are equally
<PB N="9" REF="24">&s;hared between the &s;exes always leave the parties engaged in them upon an equal footing. I never remember to have had an intimacy with any pretty woman, who appeared to me to be &s;uch after my de&s;ires were &s;atisfied, except one beautiful pea&s;ant girl of LANGUEDOC. She turned a deaf ear to my amorous propo&s;als, and I found it nece&s;&s;ary to force her. Nece&s;&s;ity ju&s;tifies every thing. I was rough, ferocious, vindictive, little &s;en&s;ible of kindne&s;s and obligations, but always retaining the mo&s;t preci&s;e recollection of, and the mo&s;t lively re&s;entment for, the &s;lighte&s;t injury.</P>
<P>I MUST here once for all apprize the reader, that though he may meet
<PB N="10" REF="25">with many terms in this book which are u&s;ed according to their ancient acceptation, he mu&s;t not therefore conclude that I under&s;tand them in that &s;en&s;e. For in&s;tance, when I &s;peak of Cruelty, I mean rather Firmne&s;s of Mind; when I call Robbery and Ma&s;&s;acre Crimes, I con&s;ider them as proofs of the mo&s;t exalted and heroic Virtue. But the Revolution of Words being not yet &s;o general in FRANCE as the Revolution of Principles, to avoid perplexing the Public, I &s;ome|times adhere to the old corrupt modes of expre&s;&s;ion. When our new Phi|lo&s;ophy is completely e&s;tabli&s;hed, it will be followed by a Vocabulary as new; till then I am afraid Language mu&s;t in &s;ome degree conform to the
<PB N="11" REF="26">old corruption. GALILEO was im|pri&s;oned for a&s;&s;erting that the Earth moved round the Sun, yet the &s;y&s;tem of COPERNICUS is the only rational one, and as &s;uch is now univer&s;ally acknowledged.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="27">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>AM TAKEN AS A LACQUEY INTO A CONVENT.&mdash;DISMISSED FROM THENCE, BUT FIRST LEARN TO READ AND WRITE.&mdash;ABRIDGMENT OF ROMAN HISTORY.&mdash;EULOGY OF THE PRESS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY childhood pa&s;&s;ed like that of mo&s;t young folks of my con|dition. When I wanted any thing, I &s;tole it; when I was cha&s;ti&s;ed, I cried; and whenever I had an opportunity, I took vengenace for it to the utmo&s;t of my power. At the age of fourteen,
<PB N="13" REF="28">having been kicked out from the ha|bitation of one of my po&s;&s;ible fathers into the &s;treet, a Monk happening to pa&s;s by, looked &s;teadily at me, and took me with him to the Convent of which he was Providore. There I &s;oon learned to re&s;pect the Church, and to make a je&s;t of Religion.</P>
<P>ONE would have thought my &s;to|mach had been an aby&s;s, and that I had birdlime at the ends of my &s;in|gers. I &s;wallowed down all &s;orts of victuals, and &s;ecreted for my own u&s;e every thing I could lay my hands on. My the&s;ts were &s;o frequent, and ma|naged with &s;o little circum&s;pection, that my ma&s;ter at la&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed me in the fact. He gently pu&s;hed me by the
<PB N="14" REF="29">&s;houlder out of the Convent, predict|ing, with a degree of confidence, that my future abode would be in the Gal|leys. Although I never imagined him to be gifted with the prophetic in&s;pira|tion of ISAIAH, his prediction however was accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>HE was too good a Chri&s;tian to di&s;|mi&s;s me from his &s;ervice without offer|ing me at the &s;ame time &s;ome whole|&s;ome advice for the regulation of my conduct; which had I ob&s;rved, it might perhaps have prevented the completion of his prophecy. During the exhortation, I &s;tole his &s;nuff-box and handkerchief, thinking it right to have &s;ome tokens, like pious relics, about me of a man &s;o holy.</P>
<P><PB REF="30"><FIGURE>
<P>During the Exhortation, I stole his Snuff-box and handkerchief.</P>
<P>Vol:I. pa:14.</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31">DURING my &s;ojourn at the Con|vent, I learned to read and write, knowing well that without the&s;e two advantages, it is impo&s;&s;ible, with the happie&s;t di&s;po&s;ition from nature, to be a rogue more than by halves. With|out acquaintance with great examples, the mo&s;t fertile genius is circum&s;cribed. Nouri&s;hed only by it&s;elf it becomes &s;terile, and, like a field without manure, in a &s;hort time produces nothing. What arms are to the Sol|dier, or in&s;truments to the Surgeon, Books are in the hands of the &s;kil|ful.</P>
<P>THE good Fathers, who remarked with &s;atisfaction my appetite for lite|rature, were eager who &s;hould be fir&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="32">to &s;upply me from their collections; but their meagre &s;helves containing nothing better than &s;tories of miracles, the Lives of Saints and Martyrs, and &s;ome receipts for making ragouts, I borrowed books of a better &s;tile in other places, or I &s;tole them.</P>
<P>THE Abridgment of the ROMAN Hi&s;tory plea&s;ed me greatly. I was much &s;truck with ROMULUS deceiving his Brother by a fal&s;e augury, and thus dexterou&s;ly getting &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom; for knavery in things &s;acred &s;uits my fancy wonderfully: but I admired him &s;till more, when I read of his knocking out this &s;ame Brother's brains, for his having in a frolic leaped over the little walls of his
<PB N="17" REF="33">new-traced city. The Rape of the SABINE Women was to me a ravi&s;hing &s;ubject. The ambition of TARQUIN the Proud, the Son-in-Law of SER|VIUS, who procured the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of his King and Father-in-Law; his Con&s;ort TULLIA trampling upon the bleeding body of her dead Sire; the incontinence of TARQUIN's Son, SEX|TUS, and the violent death of the cha&s;te LUCRETIA, came up in &s;ome degree to my ideas of human licentiou&s;ne&s;s. The fir&s;t Con&s;ul, BRUTUS, who, with|out li&s;tening to the voice of Nature, ordered his Sons' heads to be &s;truck off in his pre&s;ence for trea&s;on, appeared to me to be truly a great man. But above all, the pro&s;criptions and cruel|ties of MARIUS and SYLLA tran&s;ported
<PB N="18" REF="34">me beyond all bounds of modera|tion. ROME deluged in her own blood; the Magi&s;trates, the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable Citizens, Prie&s;ts, Women, and Children, pro&s;cribed, butchered, and their mangled carca&s;es piled up in heaps together; pre&s;ented to my mind's eye a mo&s;t &s;educing picture. In the peru&s;al, I contem|plated it with that &s;oft contentment, that interior &s;atisfaction, which re&s;ult|ed (I doubt not) from a <HI>pre&s;entiment</HI> of that enchanting &s;cene which is now &s;o admirably realized in every &s;pot and quarter of my own dearly-beloved country.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of MARK ANTONY, no le&s;s &s;anguinary than he was amo|rous,
<PB N="19" REF="35">always fixed my attention.&mdash; That celebrated Libertine, with the amiable AUGUSTUS, and their booby fellow Triumvir, LEPIDUS, pro|&s;cribing three hundred Senators and above two thou&s;and ROMAN Knights at one &s;itting, then getting drunk, and &s;inging ob&s;cene ballads together in a little I&s;land near MUTINA; FULVIA, the wife of ANTONY, dragging with her own fair fingers the tongue from the jaws of dead CICERO, and piercing it three times with her bodkin; the head of that great Orator afterwards &s;perbly impaled upon a &s;pike over the Ro&s;trum, and many other inci|dents at that period, filled me with &s;en&s;ations too delightful for me to attempt their expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="36">BUT my hero was CATILINE.&mdash; A parricide, &s;acrilegious, a ravi&s;her, adulterer, a cannibal, a pandar, and a reformer, all together, how ca lan|guage &s;urni&s;h terms to prai&s;e him &s;uf|ficiently!</P>
<P>As to the Emperors (four or five of them excepted), they were a &s;eries of de&s;peradoes, who&s;e exploits might make all the Divinities of Hell blu&s;h in the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>IN every Hi&s;tory which I peru&s;ed, I found &s;omething con&s;tantly to form the mind and improve the under|&s;tanding. That of GREECE particu|larly, in which the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Patriots and Generals were always
<PB N="21" REF="37">expo&s;ed to the fury and caprice of the Rabble, who without the lea&s;t con&s;i|deration for their &s;ervices or their merit condemned them at once to ignominy or death, awakened in my brea&s;t the mo&s;t flattering expectation of &s;oon &s;eeing in that Nation which calls her&s;elf the mo&s;t polite in EU|ROPE, the renovation of &s;imilar di&s;or|ders, and univer&s;al confu&s;ion of all things.</P>
<P>MY enquiries were not con&s;ined to the mere &s;tudy of Hi&s;tory, I devoured all the prohibited books &s;old clande&s;|tinely by the Hawkers; e&s;pecially when I could find that they contained &s;candalous anecdotes either of gallantry or of the Clergy, and when people of
<PB N="22" REF="38">condition and character were well mauled in them. By degrees I became a Critic, at la&s;t an Author. At our nightly Club of tatterdemalions, I pronounced emphatically upon the merit of every fugitive &s;heet which made its appearance for a day, gene|rally indeed without having read a word of it; but I knew the Scribbler, and my deci&s;ions were always con&s;i|dered as infallible. Without vanity I may venture to affirm, that no Libel|ler in FRANCE has ever with impu|nity &s;o deeply injured the fair fame of his neighbours as I have done.</P>

<P>THE courteous reader, I flatter my&s;elf, will ea&s;ily pardon the few apo&s;trophes in the preceding chap|ter. He who can &s;peak of Liberty without enthu&s;ia&s;m is but half a FRENCHMAN. To return to my ad|ventures.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="44">PENNYLESS, &s;orrowful, and retain|ing nothing of the Church but her na&s;al drone and her hypocri&s;y, I wan|dered about for &s;ome time without knowing whither, when the Manager of a Puppet-&s;how ordered me to fol|low him. Being arrived at the <HI>Boule|vards,</HI> we &s;topped at the entrance of an alley; there he bade me &s;tand &s;till, while he di&s;appeared, and in a few moments returned again with a Bear's &s;kin in his arms.

<PB N="29" REF="46">all, Ra&s;cal! be &s;ure to bawl loud enough to make them hear you.</Q></P>
<P>BEFORE he could well turn his back, I began to exerci&s;e my Stentorial func|tions; and I continued to bellow with &s;uch amazing vociferation that the Manager, though accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t rude and di&s;&s;onant noi&s;es, was obliged to &s;ave the drums of his ears, by putting up his hands to the &s;ides of his head, and burying his &s;conce in his mi&s;erable Theatre. As he was re|treating, he could not forbear to &s;hake his noddle, and look back at me with a &s;ort of malignant grin on his counte|nance which marked very &s;trongly both his &s;urpri&s;e and his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="47">BEHOLD me now, gentle Reader! covered with a bear-&s;kin, Bawler to a Puppet-&s;how, and deafening the whole neighbourhood. Although our Ma|nager paid me hand&s;omely enough out of the &s;canty profits of his Theatre, I re&s;olved to indemnify my&s;elf for the con&s;umption of my lungs by re&s;ources more ample than the &s;lender fund of my lawful wages. The &s;trength of my voice was well &s;econded by the agility of my hands. As the entrance to the alley where our diminutive Theatre &s;tood was &s;o narrow that not more than three or four &s;pectators could pa&s;s at a time without ju&s;tling, I remarked the circum&s;tance, and deter|mined to turn it to my advantage. I ran&s;acked the pockets of the gentry
<PB N="31" REF="48">thus huddled together, and ea&s;ed them of their contents in the twinkling of an eye, never forgetting however to cry out, <Q>Ladies and Gentlemen, take care of your pockets;</Q> but not till after I had left them nothing to take care of.</P>
<P>AT different times I left my &s;tation at the door, and went into the Hou&s;e to divert my&s;elf with examining the contortions and tri&s;tiful vi&s;ages of the good folks I had plundered. In vain did our performers, our wooden drolls exert their talents to divert them: they appeared as in&s;en&s;ible to the face|tiou&s;ne&s;s of our Actors, as our Actors them&s;elves. No power of Comedy was
<PB N="32" REF="49">&s;ufficient to bani&s;h from their minds the bitter recollection of their lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BY their air of &s;atisfaction I could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who had not yet been under my hands; and, being always a friend to EQUALITY, I deter|mined to rifle them in going out, as I had pillaged the other in coming in, and thus to leave both parties equal. Handkerchie&s;s, pur&s;es, ca&s;es, &s;nuff|boxes, every thing of the kind, had irre&s;i&s;tible attractions for me. Watch-chains wantoning from the fobs of <HI>pet&iuml;t-m&aacute;ietres</HI> or the girdles of the ladies, never glittered before me in vain.&mdash; I gently drew out their appendages of pinchbeck, &s;ilver, and &s;ometimes of
<PB N="33" REF="50">gold, as one draws a bucket out of a well, and all my goods lay &s;nug under the bear-&s;kin. There was no per&s;on in PARIS who knew &s;o well, perhaps, as my&s;elf what o'clock it was, nor de&s;erved perhaps a halter &s;o well for the accuracy of his knowledge. In that immen&s;e capital I believe I was almo&s;t the only per&s;on who could not tell the hour of the day innocently.</P>
<P>AMONG the multiplicity of my thefts, the three following are &s;uffi|ciently &s;ingular to excu&s;e the recital, and claim the reader's attention.</P>
<P>FROM the lowe&s;t depth of the pocket of one of the mo&s;t au&s;tere Prudes in the city I drew out a volume
<PB N="34" REF="51">of OVID very magnificently bound, and adorned with plates as la&s;civious as the wanton imagination of the Poet and tool of the Engraver could fancy or execute. There was no my&s;tery in the di&s;play; every thing was expo&s;ed, and in a &s;air &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>A YOUNG <HI>Devot&eacute;,</HI> pale and peevi&s;h, concealed, under the mo&s;t decrous dre&s;s, a large bottle of excellent Co|niac brandy: I laid my hands on it, and, in one draught, quaffed it off to the health of its &s;allow proprietor.</P>
<P>IN the pocket of a General Officer, decorated with the cro&s;s of St. LOUIS, I met neither pi&s;tol nor bayonet; but, in&s;tead of them, two &s;mall boxes &s;et
<PB N="35" REF="52">with diamonds; one a patch-box, the other full of lip-&s;alve. He had, how|ever, a very martial air; his &s;word was of an immea&s;urable length; his hat cocked in a mo&s;t unrelenting manner; and on his man-&s;laughtering vi&s;age, "No quarter" traced in vi&s;i|ble characters. Though he had &s;erved but two or three very inactive cam|paigus, he abounded in recitals of &s;ieges and battles. His military at|chievements, recounted by him&s;elf, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by far tho&s;e of the great FREDERIC of PRUSSIA, or of any other modern hero, who, if po&s;&s;ible, offered more &s;acrifices than that mo|narch to the Godde&s;s of Funerals.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="50">WHEN he rai&s;ed the trumpet of BELLONA to his mouth, he appeared to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a real Daemon. He imitated &s;o faithfully the contro|tions and groans of the wounded and the dying, the thundering of cannon, the bur&s;ting of bombs, and all the in&s;ernal harmony of a field of battle, that if it required &s;pirit to be pre&s;ent at the &s;cene of action, no &s;mall degree of courage was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to fortify the hearer not to &s;hrink at the recital. The &s;mall articles of his little portative toilette evidently proved that he culled ro&s;es and myrtles to deck the bower of amorous gallantry, with no le&s;s care than he gathered laurels for the field of more hardy encounters.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="54">IT happened one day, mo&s;t unfor|tunately, that while I was di&s;po&s;ing of &s;ome of my booty to an hone&s;t re|ceiver of &s;tolen goods, the owner came into the very place before the bargain was concluded. He was, no doubt, &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at this confu&s;ion of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> and to &s;ee his pro|perty thus unaccountably pa&s;&s;ing into the hands of a third per&s;on, who had no more right to make the purcha&s;e than I had to offer it. He &s;lipped out, without uttering a &s;ingle word, and in a few moments returned with two &s;turdy con&s;tables, who, after emptying my pockets compleatly, dragged me away to the <HI>Salp&eacute;triere,</HI> and left me there upon the &s;traw in a dungeon.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="55">THERE I fir&s;t became acquainted with MARAT and ROBESPIERRE, two illu&s;trious per&s;onages, who&s;e renown, great as it is, bears however no pro|portion to their exalted merit. The former had been committed for of|fences without number; the latter for having &s;ub&s;tituted his own name in|&s;tead of that of the intended legatee in a la&s;t will, which the te&s;tator, his friend and benefactor, had on his death|bed entru&s;ted to his hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>THEY appeared to be there entirely at their ea&s;e, and as familiar with the in&s;ide of the <HI>Salp&eacute;triere</HI> as the Turnkey him&s;elf. They knew all the regula|tions and vices of that in&s;ernal abode as well as if it had been the place of

<PB N="39" REF="57">their birth and education; and, after a few conver&s;ations, I found them equally well acquainted with the con|&s;titution of almo&s;t every other gaol in FRANCE. Like the Under-actors of the DUBLIN Theatre, at lea&s;t half of their time was pa&s;&s;ed in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>ROBESPIERRE, nephew of the great DAMIEN (who in 1757 was broke on the wheel, torn with pincers, tortured, dragged in pieces, and half burned alive, to the infinite entertain|ment of our FRENCH ladies), was a native of FRANCE, and went from thence to DUBLIN, where he &s;erved as Sweeper to a &s;hop in a &s;treet called <HI>Pill Lane.</HI> After many pranks and mi&s;adventures in that city, he &s;ailed
<PB N="40" REF="58">back again to FRANCE, in the hold of a merchant &s;hip, and became a &s;ort of under&s;trapper to the law, or what the ENGLISH call a <HI>Pettyfogger,</HI> at PARIS. He is unque&s;tionably a mo&s;t re&s;pectable character, endowed with the greate&s;t ver&s;atility of genius, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents and &s;pirit enough to animate a whole legion of Devils.</P>
<P>THE origin of MARAT was not more illu&s;trious than that of his fellow-pri&s;oner. He had been a Hawker of prohibited Books, and had experienced all the indignities incident to that pe|rilous occupation. Their manners were as unlike as their di&s;po&s;itions were &s;imilar. MARAT cur&s;ed and &s;wore at every &s;entence he uttered, and vouched
<PB N="41" REF="59">to the truth of the mo&s;t extravagant fal&s;hoods by the mo&s;t tremendous exe|crations. ROBESPIERRE is ma&s;ter of the mo&s;t lying in&s;inuation; his tone of voice is gentle, his words all weighed, and his whole deportment impo&s;ing. The &s;imple&s;t a&s;&s;everations &s;erve as guarantees to his want of veracity; &s;uch as, <Q>You may rely upon what I tell you</Q>&mdash; <Q>By my Honour</Q>&mdash; <Q>Upon the word of a Gentleman</Q>,&mdash;and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to determine which of the two is mo&s;t impious, or the greate&s;tliar. They &s;eem to be equal|ly rapacious and cruel, and enlight|ened by the mo&s;t confirmed Athei&s;m:
<PB N="42" REF="60">in one word, they are both exactly &s;uch men as weak Chri&s;tian morality would not fail to di&s;tingui&s;h by the appella|tion of two con&s;ummate villains.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORAL REFLECTIONS.&mdash;DISCOURSE OF ROBESPIERRE.&mdash;BIRTH OF THE DAUPHIN.&mdash;AN ANECDOTE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SEVERAL ancient and modern writers di&s;play before us many mu&s;ty reflections, which they illu&s;|trate with &s;uitable examples, to prove that mankind &s;eldom know how to frame &s;en&s;ible petitions to the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all things; that they fool|i&s;hly reque&s;t what, if granted, would
<PB N="44" REF="62">injure them, and wi&s;h to avoid what would terminate in their felicity: <Q>&mdash;Pauci digno&s;cere po&s;&s;unt Vera bona, atque illis multum diver&s;a.</Q></P>
<P>HUMAN creatures, equally &s;hort-&s;ighted in their de&s;ires and their ap|prehen&s;ions, would do wi&s;ely to leave events to the di&s;po&s;al of Fortune: that arbitre&s;s arranges things better than we can do, and conducts them by her&s;elf, without our interference, to their mo&s;t de&s;irable conclu&s;ion. My adventures ought to give &s;ome weight to this maxim.</P>
<P>INTERCEPTED as I was in the very middle of my pocket-picking career, and plunged down to the bottom of a
<PB N="45" REF="63">dungeon, a hundred times I cur&s;ed the incon&s;tancy of Fortune, who had thus betrayed me; and had not the love of life, by an in&s;tinctive impul&s;e, re|&s;trained my arm, my rage had put an end to my days on the &s;pot, and I had &s;unk into annihilation, perhaps with|out ever having known more of MARAT, and the worthy Nephew of DAMIEN, than the mere celebrity of their characters. But the Godde&s;s of ANTIUM, more propitious than my de&s;pair, by arre&s;ting my ra&s;h hand, re&s;erved me to be not only their inti|mate friend, but even their rival, and to walk hand in hand, and by the &s;ame road with them, to the great work of reforming my beloved coun|try. Yes, let me proclaim it&mdash;Under
<PB N="46" REF="64">the weight of irons, and in the dark|ne&s;s of a dungeon, was the FRENCH Triumvirate formed; that Triumvi|rate which the Shades of MARIUS, of SYLLA, and of CINNA, may contem|plate from the &s;ombrous caverns of PLUTO with admiration, nay perhaps even with envy.</P>
<P>IT happened one evening that MA|RAT, drunk as a &s;wine and all be|&s;meared with tobacco, in order to &s;nore him&s;elf &s;ober, had &s;taggered to the truckle-bed of the Turnkey's daugh|ter, a black-eyed buxom wench, who had taken a fancy to him; and the Nephew of DAMIEN and my&s;elf being thus left together, that great man addre&s;&s;ed me in the following manner:
<PB N="47" REF="65">"FRIEND COUTEAU!" &s;ays he, <Q>if you knew me well, you would do me the ju&s;tice to believe that I am not a kind of per&s;on to make much parade of my good di&s;po&s;itions to|wards my acquaintance. I leave them to di&s;cover it by proofs, and not by profe&s;&s;ions; but I know not how it is, there is &s;omething amia|ble in your a&s;pect, and a &s;ublimity in your &s;entiments, which I find to be in uni&s;on with my own feelings. Every man, the wi&s;e&s;t of us, is lia|ble to mi&s;takes, yet I do venture boldly to predict, that unle&s;s &s;ome unlucky accident happens to cut &s;hort the thread of your days, you will mount on Fortune's ladder much higher than your contempo|raries.
<PB N="48" REF="66">In your pro&s;perous a&s;cen|&s;ion, I offer my&s;elf to be your MEN|TOR, and without the mo&s;t di&s;tant motive of intere&s;t; for the happie&s;t natural di&s;po&s;itions, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of &s;ound precepts, are but like &s;hips without &s;ails, which can never arrive at the port they de&s;ire; or like birds without wings, which may at be&s;t hop alittle from the ground, but can never cleave the &s;ky like hawks and eagles. Our antimorali&s;ts, like their ad|ver&s;aries, overcharge their in&s;truc|tions. There are always &s;hades of vice as of virtue, which a ma&s;ter cannot di&s;criminate with preci&s;ion enough to place them exactly before
<PB N="49" REF="67">the eyes of the di&s;ciple. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the penetration of the pupil mu&s;t rely upon it&s;elf. The &s;agacity of the great ENGLISH Philo&s;opher NEWTON, who could analy&s;e or di&s;&s;ect a ray of light, would have been baffled had he attempted it. MY aim is to deceive the re&s;t of the world, and never to be the dupe my&s;elf; to accompli&s;h this, my rules are &s;imple. I never pro|&s;e&s;s a friend&s;hip for any man (ex|cept your&s;elf) without intending to mi&s;lead or to ruin him. I never tell a lie to any one (except your|&s;elf) without meaning it &s;hould pa&s;s for truth. I never &s;peak a
<PB N="50" REF="68">word of truth without intending it &s;hould be mi&s;taken for a lie. "YOU &s;ee," continued he, "that barbarian MARAT, &mdash;that fellow thinks I am his friend becau&s;e I call my&s;elf &s;o, and we get drunk toge|ther; but he is a real Savage, &s;o illiterate that he was hardly able to read the very titles of the books which he hawked about the &s;treets, but it was &s;ufficient for him that they were prohibited, and that their contents might do mi&s;chief. How|ever, I mu&s;t acknowledge that he has great qualifications for a Re|former: he is an Athei&s;t; violent in his temper; a &s;tranger to every
<PB N="51" REF="69">feeling of humanity: he deceives without addre&s;s, and lies without &s;hame: he is ferocious, blood|thir&s;ty, capable of every kind of atrocity; and, my dear COUTEAU! I fore&s;ee with infinite plea&s;ure, that buffle-headed profligate, in con|junction with you and me, is re|&s;erved to act a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed character on the great theatre of the univer&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>HERE he concluded. To do ju&s;|tice to MARAT, I mu&s;t acquaint the reader, that in the ab&s;ence of his friend he always &s;poke of his character with the &s;ame impartiality.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="70">I EXHAUSTED all my eloquence in thanking the Nephew of DAMIEN for the flattering &s;entiments with which he was plea&s;ed to honour me, and &s;till more for tho&s;e excellent le&s;&s;ons of practical wi&s;dom, from the ob&s;ervance of which I expected to derive &s;o much benefit. <Q>Turn them to your ad|vantage,</Q> replied he; <Q>I de&s;ire no better te&s;t of your acknowledg|ments</Q>.</P>
<P>THOUGH our time in the pri&s;on pa&s;&s;ed away tolerably well, between gaming, drinking, &s;wearing, arguing, and bla&s;pheming, our confinement at la&s;t became in&s;upportable, and we re&s;olved to e&s;cape from it. We
<PB N="53" REF="71">agreed in two days to &s;et fire to the gaol, and to lay the combu&s;tibles in &s;o many places at once that, during the general confu&s;ion, our deliverance would be certain.</P>
<P>MARAT offered in&s;tantly to cut the Turnkey's throat and his Daughter's, could their murder contribute in the lea&s;t degree to facilitate the &s;ucce&s;s of our project. "Fire and Furies!" &s;ays he <Q>they both de&s;erve it amply; and particularly my pretty brunette, for her fragility.</Q> Thus this great man always held out the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome other per&s;on as a pretext, in order to ju&s;tify him&s;elf for any much more enormous crime he was deter|minted to perpetrate. I mu&s;t acknow|ledge.
<PB N="54" REF="72">ledge I could not hear him make the propo&s;al without feeling a little emo|tion of envy: that, however, was but natural.</P>
<P>BUT all our fine projection came to nothing. On the very day before our intended conflagration, the <HI>ci-devant</HI> Queen, MARIE ANTOINETTE, was delivered of the Dauphin. The mo&s;t beautiful Prince in the world appeared, and the mo&s;t admirable project vani&s;h|ed by exactly the &s;ame incident.&mdash; LOUiS XVI. with his u&s;ual fooli&s;h compa&s;&s;ion, and willing to make his &s;ubjects participate in his happine&s;s, ordered all the pri&s;on-doors in the kingdom to be thrown open, and the wretche, confined (Ravi&s;hers and A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins
<PB N="55" REF="73">excepted) to be &s;et at liberty. The Turnkey entered, announcing to us the Dauphin's birth, and the unexpected favour of his Maje&s;ty; for which his Maje&s;ty not very long after|wards received from the Triumvirate a proof of gratitude in return as little expected.</P>
<P>THOUGH it mu&s;t occa&s;ion a &s;mall tran&s;po&s;ition in the orderly detail of my adventures, I take the liberty, for my own gratification, to anticipate the &s;mall anecdote &s;ollowing.</P>
<P>ALL the Hangmen of PARIS having refu&s;ed to be concerned in the King's murder, &s;aying that they were not A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, I offered my&s;el&s; to his mo&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="74">Serene Highne&s;s the Duke of ORLEANS, now Mr. EQUALITY, to do the bu&s;ine&s;s. The <HI>ci-devant</HI> accepted my propo&s;ition with tran&s;port.

The King looked at me, uttered a &s;hort &s;igh, and, without &s;aying a &s;ingle word, &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to my ju&s;tice. I &s;liced off his head as is related above; and thus fell LOUIS XVI. in the perfect vigour of his days, for the crime of having &s;pared the blood of his &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>ROBESPIERRE and I for a long time endeavoured to get the better of his ob&s;tinacy, but to no purpo&s;e. At la&s;t the former &s;poke to him as follows: <Q>DEAR and much&mdash;re&s;pected friend! are you crazy? Where is the good &s;en&s;e of your remaining here, even for a &s;ingle hour, when you are at liberty to leave it?&mdash; Con&s;ider that the very be&s;t con|certed conflagrations mi&s;carry &s;ome|times, and their &s;ucce&s;s is always uncertain. As to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination
<PB N="60" REF="78">of your dear mi&s;tre&s;s, and her two|penny papa, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to relinqui&s;h the &s;cheme entirely, only for a time to po&s;tpone the execution. You have my free leave to return in three or four days at mo&s;t, under the pretence of a vi&s;it of love to your dear brunette, then cut her wea&s;and, and her papa's, and every gullet you can reach at; &s;pare not, the more the better in my mind. You mu&s;t at lea&s;t acknowledge, my much-honoured friend! that it will be more noble, it will have a better air, it will in &s;hort be more like your&s;elf, to do it in the character of a friend than a pri&s;oner. Con&s;ider be&s;ides, that a man of &s;pirit may in a &s;ingle night commit more mur|ders
<PB N="61" REF="79">in the &s;treets of Paris, than he is likely to find opportunities for in three months in a pri&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>To the weight of the&s;e arguments at la&s;t MARAT acceded. We took leave of the <HI>Salp&eacute;triere</HI> together.</P>
<P>ROBESPIERRE made us mount with him to his garret, where, taking a pamphlet out of his letter-ca&s;e, after glancing it over with a paternal eye, "On the &s;trength of this," &s;ays he, <Q>we will make a jovial night of it. This is a mo&s;t bitter libel upon our Sovereign Lord the King. Here LOUIS the Sixteenth is &s;et forth as an implacable tyrant, deaf to the complaints of his &s;ubjects, and, like
<PB N="62" REF="80">another NERO, delighting only in their calamities. The hawker who ventures it for &s;ale may probably be decked with an iron collar for it, but I &s;hall receive at lea&s;t five or &s;ix good louis from a worthy book|&s;eller, who, to tell the truth, runs now and then no incon&s;iderable ri&s;k in u&s;hering my productions to the public. But, my dear friends! it is full time for you to make your&s;elves fit to be &s;een: do you, MARAT! hire a &s;urtout to cover your rags; and you, COUTEAU! a clean &s;hirt for the evening. Credit me, it is not beneath the attention of a man of &s;en&s;e to &s;ecure the re&s;pect of the world by a decent exterior, e&s;pe|cially at our fir&s;t introduction into
<PB N="63" REF="81">the company of &s;trangers. Fare|wel for the pre&s;ent; you will find me here at eight in the evening, when I &s;hall expect to &s;ee you.</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;eparated for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the toilette, and returned to ROBESPIERRE at the hour appointed. "Allons!" &s;ays he, <Q>follow me, my brave lads! I will &s;oon dome&s;ticate you among our Demi-gods.</Q></P>
<P>WE got down from the garret, which was in the middle of the <HI>Mar&s;h,</HI> and after many turnings and windings through dark and narrow lanes and alleys, groping for our way, &s;tumbling and &s;wearing, at length we &s;unk down into a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age. <Q>Keep

<PB N="65" REF="84">gloomy illumination over the&s;e &s;ons of night and their apartment. At fir&s;t view, one would have been led to imagine that the Demi gods, in&s;tead of Heaven, had been by mi&s;take con|ducted to the abode where the Scrip|ture tells us there is only weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth. They were &s;itting about a filthy, tottering, round table, which every moment appeared ready to tumble into pieces. Each of them held in his hand, or near him, an earthen pot with brandy, of &s;ome &s;trong &s;pirituous liquor, from whence exhaled a mo&s;t pe&s;ti&s;erous and over|coming odour, ju&s;t as if the gentle breezes of Mi&s;s TISIPHONE's breath were diffu&s;ed all round the chamber.
<PB N="66" REF="85">Their number might amount to about thirteen or fourteen. Two or three of them had but one hand, and as many more but one eye. Some wore &s;urtouts without &s;hirts, and others coats without wai&s;tcoats. Their breeches were clum&s;ily patched, and the foulne&s;s of their linen, of tho&s;e I mean who had any, &s;hewed plainly that they were not much in the confidence of their wa&s;herwomen.</P>
<P>WE entered. After the u&s;ual civi|lities, and the ceremony of my initia|tion, this re&s;pectable A&s;&s;embly mu|tually interchanged &s;everal que&s;tions and replies as to the manner of pa&s;&s;ing the time in their re&s;pective pri&s;ons;
<PB N="67" REF="86">for this la&s;t act of the King's grace was not le&s;s &s;erviceable to the Demi|gods than to the Triumvirate.</P>
<P>THE GANYMEDE of this Hell im|mediately entered with three decan|ters of brandy, and the remains of a leg of ram, for the three la&s;t comers.</P>
<P>WITH great tranquillity I took my &s;eat between the Nephew of DAMIEN and an athei&s;tical Demi-god by name ISNARD.</P>
<P>AFTER having ca&s;t my &s;quint all round the company, I could not &s;up|pre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing a fine Platter-breech, of a mo&s;t hideous a&s;|pect, perched up between two &s;turdy|
<PB N="68" REF="87">looking fellows at no great di&s;tance from me. "What the devil!" cried I, rather in too loud a note, <Q>a Platter breech among the Demi|gods?</Q></P>
<P>"TAKE care, for Heaven's &s;ake!" &s;ays MENTOR; <Q>he is a great Philo&s;o|pher, and worthy of his place among us. La&s;t year he murdered his mo|ther, did it with &s;o much addre&s;s, and underwent his examination af|terwards with &s;o much r&s;olution, that the Magi&s;trates, though con|vinced of his guilt, could not convict him, but were obliged to di&s;charge him. He is lecherous as a monkey, and has all that animal's mi&s;chief, of which he frequently gives us many
<PB N="69" REF="88">entertaining in&s;tances. He is well-informed, &s;peaks well, &s;ings agreea|bly, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to know his plea&s;ant qualifications without feeling an affection for him. He trundles him&s;elf here every night of our meeting, and he is greatly re|&s;pected by our whole &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P>UPON hearing this, I paid a genteel compliment to the Platter-breech, who received it with grace, indeed I may &s;ay with an air of con&s;iderable dignity, and an&s;wered me with polite|ne&s;s, though at fir&s;t a little piqued by the abruptne&s;s of my exclamation. At the reque&s;t of the Club, he favour|ed us with a ballad of his own com|po&s;ing upon the &s;ubject of King DAVID
<PB N="70" REF="89">and the Wife of URIAH the Hittite, taken from the Scripture. The bal|lad, full of ob&s;cenity and bla&s;phemy, entertained us amazingly, and there was no end of our applau&s;es.</P>
<P>HE talked afterwards like the re&s;t of the company with infinite good &s;en&s;e and energy again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion, again&s;t Providence, the im|mortality of the &s;oul, and every other dogma of the received &s;uper&s;tition, all which he burle&s;qued with incon|ceivable plea&s;antry, calling them vi|&s;ions and jargon, fit &s;ubjects enough for a &s;nuffling preacher in a pulpit, but little &s;uited to the refined morality and enlightened conceptions of &s;uch &s;trong-minded philo&s;ophers as we were.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="90">REMEMBERING the late admonition of MENTOR, who was always by my &s;ide, I &s;aid to him in a low tone of voice, <Q>Prithee, who is that heavy-looking boor, with his hands in his pocket, &s;itting oppo&s;ite to me? He has not uttered a word &s;ince we came in, and my opinion is, that he does not under&s;tand one &s;yllable of the con|ver&s;ation. Is he deaf or dumb?</Q></P>
<P>"NEITHER," an&s;wered MENTOR. <Q>He is al&s;o a great Philo&s;opher, and thinks profoundly; but being an ENGLISHMAN, he does not under|&s;tand a tittle of our language, and never attempts to &s;peak it. To tell the truth, he is not very well ac|quainted with the Grammar of
<PB N="72" REF="91">ENGLISH, for he was never at &s;chool, nor under the di&s;cipline of any in|&s;tructor. In the la&s;t war, however, he contrived to do a deal of mi&s;chief to his native country by his pamphlets and his trea&s;ons. The ENGLISH, in my mind, de&s;pi&s;e him too much, and talk more of his ro|gueries than of his publications. He was originally a bungling Stay|maker in ENGLAND, but by the intere&s;t of a Waiting-maid, who was mi&s;tre&s;s to a certain Lord's Valet de Chambre, he was appointed to a &s;mall po&s;t in the Cu&s;toms, from whence he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for a number of little plea&s;antries, which the folks there were plea&s;ed to call di&s;hone&s;ty. Afterwards he married two Widows
<PB N="73" REF="92">at the &s;ame time for their little pro|perty; he robbed them both, and then went to AMERICA, as a Patriot and a Republican, where he was indefatigable in irritating the Colo|nies again&s;t the Mother-Country. He is the very Soul of our Society. Our VOLTAIRES, ROUSSEAUS, and D'ALEMBERTS, only give us the &s;a|tisfaction to demon&s;trate that we have no chance of inheriting a future &s;tate; but this Philo&s;opher &s;hews us the direct road, and points out the infallible means to put us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the property of our neigh|bour, and of every thing de&s;irable in this under world, to which we have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant preten&s;ions from right, rea&s;on, or ju&s;tice. To
<PB N="74" REF="93">him it is we are obliged for that beautiful idea of overturning all the e&s;tabli&s;hed orders of &s;ociety; of call|ing Kings tyrants and dunderpates, laws u&s;ele&s;s, and the morality of our ance&s;tors impo&s;itions and tales of the fairies. TOM PAINE! your good health!</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e la&s;t words the boor pur&s;ed up his eye-brows, &s;tammered out a few words in ENGLISH, and pro|nounced <HI>Mount&s;heer</HI> &s;o as to be audible; then thru&s;ting his clum&s;y hands again into his pocket-holes, he made an aukward &s;ort of bow, and immediately &s;unk back into his u&s;ual &s;tate of &s;tu|pidity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>DISPERSION OF THE CLUB.&mdash;DEATH OF THYRSIS.&mdash;THE BONE-HOUSE.&mdash; AN OLD PREJUDICE REMOVED EX|PERIMENTALLY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE harmony of our Club was interrupted by an incident which happened not unfrequently in that Convention of Demi-gods. Our Athei&s;t ISNARD, who had at his left &s;ide a member blind of the right eye, &s;uddenly complained aloud that his friend the blinkard had &s;tolen his &s;ilver &s;nu&s;&s;-box. "By JUPITER," &s;ays he, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e, Ra&s;cal! you imagine I have as few eyes as your&s;elf, that
<PB N="76" REF="95">you venture to rob me in this open manner.</Q> The monoculi&s;t, who was rather choleric, only an&s;wered him by a &s;ound dou&s;e on the chops, which &s;tretched him directly at his length on the floor. Up bounced the whole A&s;&s;embly in a moment, and the engagement became general. It was all cuffing, kicking, &s;tabbing, and howling to &s;uch a degree that one would have imagined, by the ringing of the Cavern, the fury ALECTO had got among us with her horn, the con|cert was &s;o di&s;&s;onant and &s;o tremen|dous. In endeavouring to pick ROBE|SPIERRE'S pocket who was tumbled down in the &s;cuffle, I received a ga&s;h in the face from a knife, the &s;car of which is &s;till vi&s;ible, and will continue
<PB N="77" REF="96">to be &s;o to my late&s;t hour; and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, I got the wound without the plai&s;ter; I mean the money I was in &s;earch of, for MENTOR was too much-upon his guard to let him&s;elf be ea&s;ily &s;tripped of the price of his libel upon our mo&s;t excellent Sove|reign.</P>
<P>LASSITUDE at length &s;ucceeded to choler, and the honourable company &s;eparated with many prote&s;tations of mutual e&s;teem, and an engagement to meet again in the &s;ame place on the Thur&s;day following.</P>
<P>THE Nephew of DAMIEN, who had bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;ome other quarter, took leave of MARAT and me, but
<PB N="78" REF="97">fir&s;t di&s;charged our reckoning for the leg of ram and the decanters of brandy we had guzzled down before the riot began in the Cavern.</P>
<P>As we were &s;auntering up <HI>Dry-tree &s;treet,</HI> I a&s;ked MARAT if he had got any money? "Not a cro&s;s," an|&s;wered he, <Q>by ISCARIOT! But no matter, we can't want it long in the &s;treets of PARIS; the fir&s;t cod|ger we meet alone, by the Devil's gizzard, we'll empty his pockets, and then &s;lit his windpipe, bla&s;t me!</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aid, &s;o done. The words were &s;carcely uttered when an un&s;ortunate <HI>petit|ma&icirc;tre</HI> of the city appeared before
<PB N="79" REF="98">us. He wore an ill-fancied laced coat, with a hat and feather under his arm, and &s;ung "Dear THYRSIS," to the utmo&s;t extent of his vocal powers, with a mo&s;t di&s;engaged air, and in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity. O blindne&s;s to the future! O improvident <HI>petit|ma&icirc;tre!</HI> at this very moment ATROPOS is preparing the fatal &s;ci&s;&s;ars to cut the thread of thy exi&s;tence; and, if there are not &s;ongs and ballads, opera &s;e|rious, or opera buffa, in the PLUTO|NIAN regions, thou now warble&s;t in <HI>Dry-tree &s;treet</HI> the &s;weet finale to all thy mu&s;ic!</P>
<P>"BULLETS and bludgeons!" cries MARAT, "we have him."</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="99">HE let the ill-&s;tarr'd warbling beau pa&s;s by a little; then, turning &s;uddenly about, &s;eized him &s;trongly by the arms behind. I advanced in front, pre|&s;ented my knife at his throat with one hand, and rifled his pockets with the other. I took out his watch, and his pur&s;e, containing three crown-pieces, a &s;mal bit of ro&s;in, two &s;trings for a pocket fiddle, and eighteen good golden louis.</P>
<P>DURING the operation, in order to di&s;play the ju&s;tice of our proceeding, we overwhelmed him with reproaches, and the mo&s;t abu&s;ive language, as if he had been a public depredator not le&s;s infamous than CACUS, in &s;uch a man|ner
<PB N="81" REF="100">that a pa&s;&s;er-by, who only heard what was &s;aid without &s;eeing what was done, would have concluded that the <HI>petit-ma&icirc;tre</HI> was the robber, and we the &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e plea&s;antries, having cut his throat from ear to ear, with all the dexterity of a &s;urgeon, without conde&s;cending to ca&s;t another look at him, I walked on with my compa|nion, and left THYRSIS &s;tone-dead upon the pavement.</P>
<P>IN the divi&s;ion of the booty, I re|&s;erved to my&s;elf four pieces more than the half, without MARAT'S knowledge, giving him the remainder; but, in return, I generou&s;ly pre&s;ented
<PB N="82" REF="101">him with the bit of ro&s;in, and the two fiddle-&s;trings, upon which he did not &s;eem to &s;et any very great value, for he da&s;hed them at my face in a fury, cur&s;ing and &s;wearing according to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom upon every occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Queen of GNIDUS and PA|PHOS, though a Pagan Divinity, has as many altars to her honour in the capital city of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty as &s;he once had in GREECE or ITALY. One of her temples was near us, and received us like true devout &s;acrificers to the wor&s;hip with|in. Money ea&s;ily produces univer&s;al tolerance among all the amorous &s;ects who pay their homage to the Mother of the TROJANS. Without being
<PB N="83" REF="102">TARQUINS, we met with ladies as cold as LUCRETIAS till the contents of the pur&s;e of THYRSIS were di&s;played before them. That once done, we pa&s;&s;ed the night deliciou&s;ly in their arms.</P>
<P>My fair mate had all the charms without the au&s;terity of that ROMAN Prude of &s;elf-&s;laughtering memory; but, having left me early to &s;hare the tran&s;ports of another lover no le&s;s &s;entimental, MARAT came into the bed-chamber before I was well awake, and, &s;haking me rudely by the &s;houl|der, made me at fir&s;t apprehen&s;ive that the officers of ju&s;tice had laid their claws on me; but the Savage &s;oon undeceived me.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="103">"FIRE and brim&s;tone!" &s;ays he, <Q>&s;till in bed, &s;noring like a hog at this hour! Tumble out for &s;hame, boy! Lights and livers! I have a party of plea&s;ure to propo&s;e to you. You know, rip my vitals! they expo&s;e the dead bodies found in the &s;treets at night, next morning in the bone hou&s;e, bla&s;t me! It would be confoundedly ungrateful not to pay our compliments to our dear little THYRSIS, after &s;uch a regale as we have had at his expence, &s;plit me! Come along, gibbet me!&mdash; Be&s;ides the &s;atisfaction of looking at one's handy-work, it may &s;erve, by LUCIFER! to &s;trengthen our courage; though, &s;corch my mid|riff!

<PB N="85" REF="105">no great need of SPA water to brace our nerves, &s;hiver me!</Q></P>
<P>AWAY we went, and the fir&s;t object which &s;truck us was the gentle THYR|SIS &s;tretched at his length on a plank in the bone-hou&s;e, with his guttural hiatus very di&s;tingui&s;hable.</P>
<P>"To the be&s;t of my judgment," &s;ays I, <Q>this poor gentleman is not likely to be a &s;ong&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>"AH no!" an&s;wered a very pretty young woman by my &s;ide, drowned in tears, and wringing her hands mo&s;t piteou&s;ly. <Q>Alas, no! my dear dear Brother! you will never &s;ing again, nor dance again, nor teach to dance
<PB N="86" REF="106">again! May the vengeance of who&s;e inhuman hand has thus cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of your innocent, inoffen&s;ive being!</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE mu&s;t have been &s;ome &s;coun|drel!</Q> &s;ays I, with great compo|&s;ure; and, &s;o &s;aying, walked out of the boe-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS little adventure furni&s;hes me with an opportunity of expo&s;ing the futility of a vulgar notion, which is common enough among the lower &s;ort of people, namely, that the wounds of a murdered per&s;on open and bleed afre&s;h at the approach of the murderer, ju&s;t as at the time of being mortally
<PB N="87" REF="107">wounded. The fact is not &s;o. I &s;tood quite clo&s;e to the body of THYRSIS; I even put my hand upon his throat&mdash; not one drop of blood i&s;&s;ued, but all remained within, congealed and with|out circulation, ju&s;t as if the corp&s;e had lain for three weeks in the &s;nows of CANADA.</P>
<P>THUS it is that Super&s;tition would impo&s;e upon us. To aboli&s;h fal&s;e opinions, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the true, is the bounden duty of every wi&s;e man, who wi&s;hes by the light of &s;cience to in&s;truct &s;ociety, and improve his coun|try. It was not by idle &s;peculations, and ill-founded theories, but by the force of reiterated experiments, that the
<PB N="88" REF="108">great ENGLISH Chancellor BACON laid open to us the right road to u&s;e|ful knowledge and rational philo&s;o|phy.</P>

<P>DISAPPOINTED IN A ROBBERY.&mdash; ENGLISH SAILORS.&mdash;I AM SENT TO THE GALLIES.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE more I knew MARAT, the more I was attached to him. He was my PYLADES, and without his participation I had little enjoyment of the good things of this world, that is to &s;ay, the good things of other people, which were indeed my only inheritance. While our money la&s;ted, we &s;wam in the delights of PARIS:
<Q><L>The God of Wine our wit inflam'd,</L>
<L>And CUPID fir'd our hearts.</L></Q>
<PB N="90" REF="110">But by our debaucheries and our amours, our &s;unds were &s;oon exhau&s;t|ed.

<P>BUT knowing, in &s;pite of what the Scripture tells us to the contrary, that the victory <HI>is</HI> to the &s;trong, we con&s;i|dered the con&s;umption of our pur&s;e with great indifference. By a little dexterity we &s;upplied our ordinary demands, and &s;ufficient unto the day was the roguery thereof. But, little &s;atisfied with &s;uch &s;lender and uncer|tain
<PB N="91" REF="111">re&s;ources, we meditated depreda|tions on a larger &s;cale. We agreed in one of our <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</HI> not to confine our ambition to the certain and inglo|rious plunder of &s;ingle pa&s;&s;engers, but to attack all we met, even in bodies, without the lea&s;t con&s;ideration of their &s;trength or numbers.</P>
<P>FULL of &s;uch heroical re&s;olutions, after a clo&s;e examination of our fire|arms, we &s;allied out one Sunday even|ing, certain of returning at night loaded with the <HI>&s;polia opima.</HI> But, alas! how many accidents happen in life again&s;t which we make no provi|&s;ion.

<P>THE Roa&s;t-beef, Salt-water, EN|GLISH Regicides were by no means obedient. After &s;quirting &s;ome chew|ed tobacco from the corner of their mouths, and one of them crying out
<PB N="93" REF="113">to his companion, <Q>Bla&s;t my eyes! Pirates!</Q> they an&s;wered our requi|&s;ition in a manner we little expected. Without &s;hrinking an inch, or di&s;co|vering te lea&s;t &s;ign of apprehen&s;ion, they levelled two blows at our heads with their oaken cudgels, one of which in&s;tantly knocked the pi&s;tol out of MARAT's hand, and the other made me vibrate like a pendulum. I fired notwith&s;tanding, and mi&s;&s;ed. Away ran the women, and the cudgels began to play about our ears mo&s;t unmerci|fully.</P>
<P>SEEING, as we did, the &s;trength and re&s;olution of the enemy, we had no choice but flight. We took to our heels, and the ENGLISH Regicides
<PB N="94" REF="114">after us. I under&s;tood their language, and heard them clo&s;e behind us, now and then encouraging each other, and one crying out, "More &s;ail, TOM!" and TOM an&s;wering, "Aye, aye," ju&s;t as if they had been at &s;ea, and giving chace to the &s;hips of an enemy.</P>
<P>BEING better acquainted than the Sailors with the windings and turn|ings of that quarter, we had nearly e&s;caped from them, when, as ill for|tune would have it, one of our noc|turnal Club, the Demi-god PLATTER|BREECH, happened to be &s;pinning about quite clo&s;e to me. Somehow or other he got entangled between my legs with his cur&s;ed platter, and down I tumbled. MARAT fell over
<PB N="95" REF="115">me, and thus were the three Demi|gods turned head over heels, in the middle of the mud, at the mercy of two furious Tars, who, while their cudgels de&s;cended as thick as hail|&s;tones on our carca&s;es, were all the time &s;aluting our ears with the appel|lations of <HI>Mount&s;heers, Soupemeagre,</HI> INDIAN <HI>Turkey-cocks,</HI> (meaning to call us &s;omething el&s;e a little like it in &s;ound) and <HI>cowardly</HI> FRENCH <HI>hang|dogs.</HI> After drubbing us to their hearts content, they looked about, and not finding their la&s;&s;es, left us to go in &s;earch of them; but fir&s;t, &s;eeing the Platter-breech tumbled over, they replaced him in his equipage, and throwing him a handful of &s;ilver from
<PB N="96" REF="116">their coat pockets, with a cur&s;e or two they quitted us.</P>
<P>THIS bu&s;ine&s;s may &s;erve as a &s;mall &s;pecimen of ENGLISH Sailors. Here I &s;hall take the liberty of offering a little advice to &s;uch of my readers as may hereafter feel an inclination to rob folks of this de&s;cription, which is, to cut their throats fir&s;t, and rob them afterwards; by this arrangement, the affair will be in a better train, and le&s;s liable to &s;uch untoward accidents as I have ju&s;t related.</P>
<P>DELIVERED in this manner from our enemies, we thought our&s;elves &s;afe; and, being &s;eated on our rumps
<PB N="97" REF="117">in the middle of the kennel, began to &s;hake our ears like &s;paniels ju&s;t come out of the water, when lo! a much wor&s;e misfortune befel us than the ba&s;tinado we had &s;o lately experienced.</P>
<P>THE Watch, alarmed by the cries of the women, came up &s;uddenly, and dragged us off before a neighbouring magi&s;trate, there to undergo an exa|mination.</P>
<P>WHEN we appeared before the Ju&s;tice, MARAT thought proper, from a mere impul&s;e of mode&s;ty, to with|draw from the <HI>eclat</HI> of his real name, and to rebaptize him&s;elf by that of CLAUDIUS ARNAUD, Gentleman.&mdash;
<PB N="98" REF="118">The metonymy was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary; for, without it, the matter would have been decided again&s;t us in&s;tantly. We prote&s;ted our innocence with &s;o much effrontery, calling Heaven and all the &s;aints in the calendar to witne&s;s that the ENGLISH were the aggre&s;&s;ors, and our flight only the con&s;equence of our apprehen&s;ion, that the ma|gi&s;trate began to be puzzled. Ob&s;erv|ing the &s;ucce&s;s of our fir&s;t fiction, we re&s;olved, without invoking the aid of the Gods of OVID, to metamorpho&s;e all the per&s;onages of the piece, and to accu&s;e our accu&s;ers. We charged the women as accomplices with the ENGLISH Pirates, in a manner &s;o &s;o|lemn, and with &s;uch an air of veracity,
<PB N="99" REF="119">that the Ju&s;tice was within a moment of becoming perfectly unju&s;t, by com|mitting them, and giving us our li|berty.</P>
<P>WHILE this point was depending, one of the Marechau&s;&s;e&eacute; happened mo&s;t unfortunately to come into the office, and &s;eeing MARAT in cu&s;tody called him by his name. The &s;cene &s;hifted in a moment.</P>
<P>"AH! ah! Scoundrel! is it you?" &s;ays the Judge; <Q>your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, Mr. CLAUDIUS ARNAUD, Gentleman!</Q></P>
<P>HE then examined his criminal regi&s;ter, and finding my name al&s;o
<PB N="100" REF="120">in its proper place, he &s;entenced us both on the &s;pot to three years impri&s;onment in the gallies.</P>
<P>MARAT, furious to find him&s;elf thus baffled, lo&s;t all patience, and vo|mited out &s;uch a torrent of obloquy and &s;currility again&s;t the office, that the repre&s;entative of THEMIS, in ad|dition, or as a rider to the re&s;t of his &s;entence, ordered him, before he &s;et out upon his trip to Mar&s;eilles, to receive a hundred la&s;hes from a cat of nine tails &s;oundly applied to his naked &s;houlders, and &s;o ended our examina|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="121">THUS does the fickle Godde&s;s de|light to frolic. Behold this great man re&s;erved to be at one time the Framer of Laws, the Purifier of Philo&s;ophy, the Reformer of his Country, the Fra|ternizer of EUROPE, the Judge and Sentencer of his Sovereign; at another period, hand-cuffed, tied to a po&s;t, and &s;kipping and writhing under the &s;courge of the executioner. I &s;tood by, and offered him my compliments of condolence with apparent &s;incerity, but privately I gave the hangman a &s;mall piece of money I had about me, not to &s;pare him, but to lay it on &s;oundly; well knowing that had our &s;ituations been but changed, my PYLADES would

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>RELEASED FROM THE GALLIES.&mdash; MENTOR PRESENTS ME TO THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.&mdash;THE DUKE ENTRUSTS ME WITH AN IMPOR|TANT COMMISSION.&mdash;ZARA IM|PALED. &mdash; ENCOMIUM ON THE DUKE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS mo&s;t of my readers, no doubt, have &s;erved in the gallies, it would be but lo&s;t time to de&s;cribe to them the daily cour&s;e of life there. To make a figure there, patience is the virtue mo&s;t requi&s;ite. Fa&s;ting, the
<PB N="104" REF="124">&s;courge, and &s;etters, are dealt out to the mi&s;erable convicts with the utmo&s;t impartiality, and happy is he who can be&s;t &s;upport them. The captain of each galley exerci&s;es a de&s;potic tyran|ny, and tho&s;e who were to know the &s;ufferings, without at the &s;ame time knowing the crimes and di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;laves, would imagine they were treated with the mo&s;t di&s;proportionate inhumanity. The back of the hor&s;e is made for the rider, and the &s;houl|ders of the galley-&s;lave for the &s;courge. Time, however, &s;oftens every thing. Our mo&s;t flattering con&s;olation re&s;ult|ed from this con&s;ideration, that there were other human beings more un|fortunate than our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="125">THE wretches condemned to the oar for ten years, or for life, made a je&s;t of our complaints, and con&s;idered our con|dition as truly enviable. Compari&s;on upon the whole reconciles all calami|ties. I knew a celebrated <HI>Suavio</HI> at Paris, who was out of humour the whole time of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite en|tertainment, if a gla&s;s of Champagne not &s;ufficiently iced was offered to him, while above half the inhabitants of that great city were obliged to con|tent them&s;elves with the wine of the country, acid as vinegar, and well heated with &s;corching &s;un-beams.</P>
<P>MARAT and I, little &s;atisfied with exerci&s;ing the cardinal virtue of pa|tience, meditated many fruitle&s;s pro|jects
<PB N="106" REF="126">to deliver our&s;elves from captivi|ty, but we ruined our &s;chemes by communicating them to other villains. Four Demi-gods of our Clu happen|ed to be chained to the &s;ame bank of oars with us, and they always &s;poke with &s;uch bitter exa&s;peration again&s;t the tyranny exerci&s;ed over us, that we concluded they would eagerly join with us in any enterprize, however perilous, which could contribute to our emancipation.</P>
<P>"PILLAGE and plunder!" &s;ays MARAT; <Q>leave lamentations to wo|men, liberty and vengeance were made for men. Earthquakes and thunder! let us turn our chains to arms, and this very night da&s;h out
<PB N="107" REF="127">the brains of this &s;coundrel ba&s;haw, who gives us &s;u&s;tenance by &s;cruples, and fetters by the ton weight.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the da&s;tards, in&s;tead of co-ope|rating with us, only betrayed us into the hands of the enemy. Then the la&s;h was applied in triple do&s;es, and our irons doubled in &s;uch a manner that our backs were as finely te&s;&s;elated as the pavement of Solomon's Temple, and we endured a burden of fetters enough to &s;train the loins of a &s;tout pack-hor&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT nothing could &s;ubdue us.&mdash; Genius may be for a while beat down, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to annihilate it. &mdash;Like ENCELADUS under Mount AEtna, it makes &s;uch &s;truggles, and the
<PB N="108" REF="128">efforts are &s;o violent, that its powers and energy are con&s;picuous under the oppre&s;&s;ion, and perhaps then mo&s;t for|midably.</P>
<P>LOADED as we were with irons, torn with &s;tripes, and our &s;trength re|duced to half its con&s;i&s;tence by inani|tion, who would not have imagined that under &s;uch a regimen we &s;hould not have &s;unk into &s;ubjection? But not &s;o, we an&s;wered cha&s;ti&s;ement by bla&s;phe|my, and met menaces with abu&s;e. The Captain never ventured to ap|proach us without a cocked pi&s;tolin his hand, and two or three times prote&s;ted he would blow our brains out for an example to the re&s;t, and to re&s;tore order and di&s;cipline in the gallies.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="129">But our fortune was &s;oon to change her a&s;pect. After a year pa&s;&s;ed as de|&s;cribed above, I had a letter from ROBESPIERRE, communicating to me the happy intelligence that, by his in|tere&s;t with his Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s the DUKE OF ORLEANS, we were to be &s;et at liberty. At the &s;ame time, the Ma&s;ter of the Galley received a letter in the Duke's hand, ordering us to be relea&s;ed, and furni&s;hed with money for our expences to Paris.</P>
<P>THE Captain obeyed the mandate with great &s;atisfaction, and &s;ent us out of the di&s;trict under a &s;trong guard, not &s;uppo&s;ing he could be one hour in &s;afety till we were removed at lea&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="130">a full league's di&s;tance from the circle of his juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>PRISONS and the gallies are nur&s;e|ries and hot-beds for wickedne&s;s, and he who enters but a &s;imple cheat or pickpocket, leaves them with all the accompli&s;hments of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in or a parricide. This is the rea&s;on why the DUKE OF ORLEANS always cho&s;e &s;uch accomplices and a&s;&s;ociates as had either been in gaols, or de&s;erved to be in them. The body of FEDERATES from MARSEILLES, who, in 1792, &s;o glo|riou&s;ly deluged FRANCE in the blood or prie&s;ts, pri&s;oners, women, and chil|dren, was chiefly compo&s;ed of galley|&s;laves. They were in the DUKE's
<PB N="111" REF="131">pay, and executed his bloody orders with a preci&s;ion &s;o exact, with &s;uch &s;ublime ferocity, that the Satellites of SYLLA were not more entitled to uni|ver&s;al admiration, nor de&s;erved better the everla&s;ting gratitude of their &s;ub|orner. But let us return to our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IN our journey we atchieved little worthy of recollection, except a good many robberies, and killing three &s;habby &s;ort of travellers, who&s;e throats it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to cut, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pur&s;es, and to make &s;ure of their taciturnity.</P>
<P>ROBESPIERRE received us at Paris with open arms, and we pa&s;&s;ed the time mo&s;t agreeably in giving him the
<PB N="112" REF="132">detail of our adventures, ad in li&s;ten|ing to the recital of his. O how de|lightful are the&s;e overflowings of the heart among true friends! <Q><HI>Felices ter et amplius,</HI></Q> tho&s;e who can expe|rience them.</P>
<P>THE Nephew of DAMIEN, as he informed us, was become favourite to the DUKE OF ORLEANS, and had the honour of being employed by him in &s;everal very delicate commi&s;&s;ions, where he had manife&s;ted con&s;iderable talents for bu&s;ine&s;s, and great zeal for his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice. Among &s;everal other particulars of the &s;ame nature, he diverted us extremely by telling us how he had, by his Highne&s;s' order, given poi&s;on to the PRINCE DE LAM|BALLE
<PB N="113" REF="133">one day as he returned from hunting, and complained of thir&s;t; and how he had forged a will for the dead Prince, by which his Highne&s;s became heir to the immen&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of that Prince, fru&s;trating by this ma|noeuvre the DUCHESS OF LAMBALLE and the children of that lady, who would have been otherwi&s;e the right|ful inheritors. He a&s;&s;ured us, at the &s;ame time, that his Highne&s;s was little &s;atisfied with &s;uch frivolous opera|tions; but meditated nobler and more exten&s;ive projects, of which he was not yet &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter to give us the detail, as we might de&s;ire, &s;peci|fically.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="134">"BUT, friend COUTEAU," conti|nued he, <Q>I have been thinking of a little arrangement for you before you left the gallies, and pray attend to it. Hitherto your travels have been confined to FRANCE. To be wi&s;e as ULYSSES, it is nece&s;&s;ary, like him, to &s;ee foreign countries:&mdash; <HI>Multorum providus urbes et mores hominum in&s;pexit.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice of my patron, that he &s;hould have &s;ome one of my recommendation; a man of honour, like you, to inform him authen|tically of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of IRE|LAND. The DUKE has heard, with plea&s;ure, that there are a &s;et of gal|lant fellows there, called <HI>Houghers,</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="135">who ham&s;tring &s;oldiers in the dark, and perform other &s;uch little plea|&s;ing freaks as well de&s;erve his favour|able notice. He hears al&s;o that there is an A&s;&s;ociation, called <HI>United Iri&s;hmen,</HI> that is, <HI>united</HI> again&s;t the laws, religion, and peace of their country; and it &s;ometimes happens that the&s;e worthy people are hang|ed, or &s;entenced to tran&s;portation, for want of money, or a protector, who, by his credit, might &s;ave them from that ignoble inju&s;tice which per&s;ecutes what they fal&s;ely call tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in countries unen|lightened with true philo&s;ophy.&mdash; The DUKE wi&s;hes to know their real &s;trength and numbers, and to a&s;&s;ure them of his e&s;teem and countenance.
<PB N="116" REF="136">Prepare, therefore, &s;peedily for your journey: I will pre&s;ent you this very day to his Highne&s;s, who will furni&s;h you with money for the expences of your commi&s;&s;ion, and give you, with his own mouth, your final in&s;tructions how to regulate your conduct among &s;trangers.</Q></P>
<P>DURING our conver&s;ation, the DUKE came into the apartment of DAMIEN'S Nephew; and, on my being pre&s;ented to him, behaved to me with the greate&s;t affability.</P>
<P>"Is it really true," &s;ays he, with a &s;mile &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of the augu&s;t ferocity of his heart, <Q>that you cut a citizen's throat in the &s;treets of
<PB N="117" REF="137">Paris, while he was &s;inging <HI>Dear Tyr&s;is,</HI> and next morning went to &s;ee his body in the bone-hou&s;e?</Q></P>
<P>I ANSWERED, with mode&s;ty, that it was perfectly true, and that I was ready to undertake much more ha|zardous exploits for the &s;ervice of his Highne&s;s, whenever he might conde|&s;cend to honour me with his com|mands.</P>
<P>"We &s;hall &s;ee," an&s;wered he.&mdash; <Q>I expect your company at fix to-day, with the Nephew of DAMIEN.</Q></P>
<P>HE then conver&s;ed a little in pri|vate with MENTOR, and departed; but not till he hd left on my mind a
<PB N="118" REF="138">mo&s;t advantageous impre&s;&s;ion of his di&s;po&s;ition by the following little inci|dent, which, being willing to amu&s;e the reader, I think my&s;elf not at liber|ty to with-hold from him.</P>
<P>THE true character of men is per|haps better di&s;covered by their conduct in &s;mall matters, than in great events and important conjunctures. At &s;uch criterions there is generally a con&s;o|nance of &s;en&s;ation which produces a con&s;onance of thought and determina|tion, and man is man by the leading impul&s;e of human nature; but the mind, left entirely at its ea&s;e, acts in|dependently of any extraneous bias, and &s;hews it&s;elf in its real ab&s;tract propen|&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="139">WE were &s;tanding together at an open window which looks into the &s;treet, when ZARA, a pretty little &s;he|&s;paniel big with puppies, left her mat in the corner of the chamber, and came towards his Highne&s;s crouching, wagging her tail, licking his feet, and offering him her little affectionate ca|re&s;&s;es. He wore white &s;tockings; and whether it was that ZARA put up her paws on his white &s;tockings, or whether it was that he has an aver&s;ion to dogs, I know not, but he took her by the neck, and, extending his arm from the window, let the little mother drop on the iron &s;pikes of the railing, where &s;he was impaled immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="140">WHILE &s;he was writhing and howl|ing in her angui&s;h, the fir&s;t Prince of the Blood looked at her with great &s;atisfaction, &s;napping his fingers, and crying out, in a fondling tone of voice, from the window, <Q>Come here, little ZARA! What are you doing there, you gip&s;ey! Come to me; come to your ma&s;ter, hu&s;&s;ey!</Q> and &s;o on, in that &s;ort of coaxing tone which we u&s;e to little dogs when we want to trifle with them.</P>
<P>THE Commentators of the Poet SHAKPAR, (the CORNEILLE of ENGLAND) direct the reader to ad|mire the following trait in the part of BRUTUS, the principal character in
<PB N="121" REF="141">the Tragedy of JULIUS CAESAR.&mdash; BRUTUS &s;itting at midnight in his tent, ju&s;t before the Battle of Phi|lippi, ob&s;erves one of his attendants, who had been playing on the lute to him, ju&s;t dropping a&s;leep over the in&s;trument. He ri&s;es, takes it from his lap without awakening him, &s;ay|ing at the &s;ame time, in a very gentle tone of voice, <Q>If thou do&s;t nod, thou'lt break thy in&s;trument.</Q>&mdash; This little touch, the critics tell us, di&s;covers wonderfully well the good di&s;po&s;ition and natural benignity of BRUTUS' character.</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;uppo&s;e, by a long di&s;&s;ertation, to di&s;play to the ob|&s;erver the difference between the A&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in
<PB N="122" REF="142">of JULIUS CAESAR and of LOUIS CAPET, and how much the FRENCH|MAN &s;urpa&s;&s;es the ROMAN in gran|deur of &s;oul and dignity of &s;entiment.</P>
<P><Q>O THE great man! the great man!</Q> cried I; <Q>he will murder half the world. O the great man!</Q></P>
<P>"HE is a great man," an&s;wered MENTOR, <Q>who will be the maker of your fortune. As &s;uch re&s;prect him;</Q> and we parted.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I DINE AT THE PALAIS ROYAL.&mdash; CHARACTER OF THE DUKE IN HIS ABSENCE BY ROBESPIERRE.&mdash;RE|CEIVE MY INSTRUCTIONS.&mdash;THE DUKE DISCONTENTED WITH THE KING AND QUEEN.&mdash;JUST CAUSE FOR BEING SO.&mdash;HIS MOST SERENE HIGHNESS GETS DRUNK.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEVER forgetting MENTOR'S &s;age maxim, that the out&s;ide ought not to be neglected, I paid mo&s;t particular attention to my dre&s;s before I made my entrance at the palace. I wa&s;hed my hands and face; a hair|dre&s;&s;er
<PB N="124" REF="144">fini&s;hed my red locks with great ta&s;te, three &s;erious curls and two flutterers at each &s;ide; my white &s;ilk &s;tockings were darned only in two or three places, and the&s;e hardly vi&s;ile; I hired a clean &s;hirt, and a complete &s;uit of clothes, in <HI>Frippery-&s;treet</HI>&mdash;and thus equipped, with a noble air, I pre|&s;ented my&s;elf at the palace.</P>
<P>MENTOR had got there before me, and I found him in a magnificent anti|chamber, waiting for the DUKE to join the company. At &s;eeing me he could hardly &s;uppre&s;s his amazement.</P>
<P>"AH! ah!" cried he, <Q>my dear friend, you look wonderfully well. If you had no face at all, or any other
<PB N="125" REF="145">face but that which you have, upon my honour! the women would pull caps for you. What! curled, pow|dered, &s;ilk &s;tockings, a clean &s;hirt, and a &s;word by your &s;ide! By the word of a gentleman! you might &s;it for your picture: but you don't, perhaps, know, that to that face, &s;uch as it is, you are indebted for the partiality of his Highne&s;s.&mdash; The Prince &s;aw you by accident in the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> and your appearance immediately fa&s;cinated him. I was as u&s;ual at his &s;ide, and took the opportunity of giving him an ac|count of your adventures &s;o advanta|geou&s;ly for you, that from that mo|ment he re&s;olved to have you upon his li&s;t. But mark me; before he
<PB N="126" REF="146">comes in, let me give you a &s;hort &s;ketch of his real character; for, without that chart before your eyes, you may not be able to &s;teer the ve&s;&s;el into her harbour.</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;at down, and MENTOR thus re&s;umed the &s;ubject: <Q>MY Lord has as much politene&s;s as man can have, and in every thing &s;uperficial is perfectly a gentleman. He is preci&s;ely the very rever&s;e of a turtle, who&s;e impenetrable out&s;ide covers the &s;oft meat within, for he is as in&s;en&s;ible to every feeling of humanity as a tyger of Africa.&mdash; He is prodigal without genero&s;ity, a niggard without oeconomy, timid
<PB N="127" REF="147">without caution, and ra&s;h without courage. Good &s;en&s;e (of which he has but a very &s;lender portion) &s;eldom is his director. He &s;ees things not by the light of rea&s;on, but through the medium of his pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices. His model is his ance&s;tor the DUKE OF ORLEANS who was Regent in the late King's minority. The Regent was fond of women; his Highne&s;s is as incontinent as TARQUIN.&mdash; The Regent &s;ometimes loved a jo|vial gla&s;s; his Highne&s;s is drunk con&s;tantly.&mdash;The Regent liked mixed company; his Highne&s;s keeps open hou&s;e for all the &s;cum and rabble of the kingdom; and &s;o in every thing el&s;e. He re&s;embles
<PB N="128" REF="148">him in all his weakne&s;&s;es and ill qualities, in not one of the good, and only imitates in <HI>outr&eacute;eing</HI> the prototype. He has neither the &s;pirit, the genius, nor the good natural di&s;|po&s;ition of his ance&s;tor. He re|&s;embles him, in &s;hort, as a great Flemi&s;h Draught-hor&s;e is like a fleet, high-mettled Arabian Cour|&s;er; both are hor&s;es, and there ends the &s;imilitude. He loves flattery to an extravagance, and particularly to be flattered for what he does not po&s;|&s;e&s;s, exten&s;ive views, and the pro|found &s;cience of Politics, in which la&s;t he is perpetually outwitted.&mdash; He will be, or I am greatly mi&s;taken, the dupe of his own ambition; for he meditates a number of bold un|dertakings,
<PB N="129" REF="149">and is de&s;titute at the &s;ame time of every quality of the mind which might po&s;&s;ibly give him a chance of &s;ucceeding in them. However, he is a good milch-cow, and we will not be tired of holding the pail till he is tired of letting us milk him. He has loaded me with favours and benefits, and you may &s;ee, my dear COUTEAU! I &s;peak of his character with the amiable par|tiality of a friend penetrated with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of obligations.&mdash; Make then a little abatement on account of this partiality which I have ju&s;t mentioned, and you will then be exactly in a po&s;ition to form a candid e&s;timate of the DUKE my
<PB N="130" REF="150">patron: but no more, for here comes his Highne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>I REFLECTED a moment upon the abatement recommended to me; and, to &s;ay the truth, I could not di&s;cover, on the &s;ide of morality, what was to remain to his Highne&s;s afterwards.</P>
<P>THE DUKE came in, holding a let|ter in his hand which he delivered to me, directed to Me&s;&s;ieurs HEROD and JUDAS, Bankers, <HI>Inns-quay, Ploody|bridge,</HI> DUBLIN.</P>
<P><Q>THIS is to bear your charges in Dublin,</Q> &s;ays he. <Q>I have not confined you in your expences;
<PB N="131" REF="151">only take care not to exceed tho &s;um mentioned, without acquaint|ing me with the occa&s;ion by letter. If you &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to hire &s;ome re&s;olute fellows to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate the Lord Lieutenant, or Chan|cellor, or any other great officer of &s;tate, you &s;hall have a particular credit for the purpo&s;e, or for any other of that &s;ort; but provi&s;ions for occurrences of this nature are not contained in that letter, which is only meant for every day's cur|rent occa&s;ions. But dinner is rea|dy; we will talk of bu&s;ine&s;s at table.</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;at down. O Idol of APICIUS! O Genius of Gormandizing! what an
<PB N="132" REF="152">entertainment for two &s;coundrels, and a debauched De&s;cendant of Royalty! The &s;en&s;uality of a Conclave of Cardi|nals mu&s;t have allowed it was excel|lent. Such <HI>&s;oupes!</HI> &s;uch <HI>ragouts!</HI> &s;uch <HI>pat&eacute;s!</HI> &s;uch a <HI>de&s;&s;ert!</HI> and &s;uch variety of delicious wines!</P>
<P>THE DUKE'S appetite was no di&s;|grace to the Hou&s;e of BOURBON, and he drank like a true Prince of the Blood Royal. At every bumper his heart began more and more to open, and in proportion his folly to expand it&s;elf. What <HI>platitudes</HI> on his part, and what eulogiums upon ours! The conte&s;t &s;eemed to be, whether his Highne&s;s &s;hould be mo&s;t dull, or we mo&s;t flattering; our compliments were
<PB N="133" REF="153">exactly in an inver&s;e ratio to his me|rit; but as his Highne&s;s had little more to do than to ge&s;ticulate his acknowledgments, and we had the labour of furni&s;hing the matter for them; as he was but pa&s;&s;ive, and we active in the &s;cene, much the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome part in the piece fell upon our &s;houlders.</P>
<P>THE heat of wine and adulation having at la&s;t &s;oftened his heart to a &s;tate of fu&s;ion, out it ran in a &s;tream of indi&s;creet confidence as follows: FRIEND COUTEAU! &s;ays he, <Q>without doubt, you don't believe in GOD?</Q>
<PB N="134" REF="154">"GOD forbid," an&s;wered I, with vivacity; <Q>I know no Divinity ex|cept your Highne&s;s.</Q>
"GOOD," returned he; <Q>but it is not enough to be an Athei&s;t your|&s;elf, you mu&s;t endeavour to make others &s;o. We have not any greater enemy than the Chri&s;tian Religion. It teaches men to be ju&s;t, grateful, compa&s;&s;ionate, hone&s;t, content with their condition, loyal, and I know not how many other weakne&s;&s;es utterly incompatible with the new philo&s;ophy of which I profe&s;s my|&s;elf a confirmed di&s;ciple.</Q>
<PB N="135" REF="155">"YOUR Highne&s;s," &s;ays I, <Q>&s;peaks with too much mode&s;ty; you are an Apo&s;tle.</Q></P>
<P>BY agreement we then drank in a bumper, on our knees, the memory of SPINOSA. The DUKE then, help|ing him&s;elf largely to &s;ome perigord pye, went on thus: <Q>As a cook before he makes a <HI>fri|candeau,</HI> a collar, or a pa&s;ty, takes the bones out to form it to his ta&s;te and render it pla&s;tic, &s;o we mu&s;t try to unbone the human heart of all religion, before it will receive kindly the form which it is our intere&s;t to give it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="156">THE Nephew of DAMIEN and my|&s;elf a&s;&s;ured him upon this, with equal truth and &s;olemnity, that we never had the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of any religion what&s;oever; nor did we know, or had we heard of a &s;ingle per&s;on who pre|tended to it; the KING, perhaps, might be an exception; but his imbecility was notorious. I added, with a well-urned compliment, that the example of one great man like his Highne&s;s, was likely to do more good than the books of twenty VOLTAIRES and MIRA|BEAUS, with all their parts, their zeal, and their learning. Thus &s;atisfied on the article of our infidelity, the Prince proceeded:
<PB N="137" REF="157"><Q>YOU mu&s;t know, friend COU|TEAU, that we have determined to leave in FRANCE neither GOD nor Gentleman. Every thing, I think, promi&s;es to be top&s;y-turvy, and &s;o much the better. You &s;ee in your Landlord, my worthy fellows! the man in all FRANCE mo&s;t incen&s;ed again&s;t his Sovereign, and who, perhaps, has the be&s;t ju&s;tification for being &s;o, and you &s;hall hear my rea&s;on. IF I have any weakne&s;s, it is my pa&s;&s;ion for women: it mu&s;t be al|lowed they are delicious creatures. I always wi&s;h I had a hundred mouths to ki&s;s, as many arms to cla&s;p them, and a hou&s;e ten times
<PB N="138" REF="158">as large as the Palais Royal to enter|tain them in. Our Queen MARY ANTOINETTE is certainly a mo&s;t de&s;irable piece of incarnation. Her &s;hape, her fre&s;hne&s;s, her neck, her ivory arms, her beautiful legs&mdash;in &s;hort, the whole object taken toge|ther &s;et me on fire, and I concluded &s;he would be an ea&s;y conque&s;t, for &s;he was always chearful, and con|&s;tantly in the greate&s;t flow of &s;pi|rits. After her marriage, I paid my court to her with great a&s;&s;iduity, and ogled her without mercy.&mdash;One day I found her by accident quite alone at TRIANON, &s;itting in an ea&s;y chair, and knotting. I threw my&s;elf at her feet in a tran&s;port, avowed my pa&s;&s;ion, and, after pro|te&s;ting
<PB N="139" REF="159">that I entertained the mo&s;t profoundly-re&s;pectful &s;entiments of her virtue, I concluded by &s;wearing fervently that I could never enjoy an hour's happine&s;s without the dear hope of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of my extatic life in her cele&s;tial arms. To tell the truth, &s;he appeared a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed at the declaration.&mdash;She pu&s;hed back her chair a little, and, with a &s;ort of &s;tately air, ju&s;t uttered the&s;e few words: "So, I &s;ee your Highne&s;s gets intoxicated in the morning!" for I was always drunk after dinner. Up I bounced, &s;eized her in my arms, and, before &s;he could prevent it, forced a ki&s;s from her. The breath of CYTHE|REA was not &s;weeter. She repul&s;ed
<PB N="140" REF="160">me &s;teadily, the colour mounted to her cheeks, and tears &s;tood trem|bling in her eyes, and ju&s;t at this critical moment in walked his Ma|je&s;ty. Seeing the QUEEN &s;o di&s;|compo&s;ed, and my Highne&s;s half a&s;hamed ened, "What is the meaning of all this?" &s;ays "Royalty. "Turn out that Ruffian," replied the QUEEN, and walked out of the chamber. "What!" cries the KING, "make love to my wife, villain! Be gone, and never dare again to appear in my pre&s;ence. BY this time I was a little reco|vered, &s;o I re&s;olved to put a good face on the matter, and, in a &s;ort of rallying tone, "Good faith, Cou&s;in,"
<PB N="141" REF="161">&s;ays I, "here's a great deal &s;aid, and very little done. If you are re&s;olv|ed to bani&s;h every one who would wi&s;h to prevent your monopolizing that pretty MARY of yours, you will &s;oon have the comfort of a mo&s;t agreeable &s;olitude here at your little TRIANON." He madeno other an|&s;wer to this plea&s;antry than giving me a great kick in the breech, which made me bounce out of the room like a pellet out of a pop-gun. SINCE that time I have hardly thought of any thing but their de|&s;truction, and I &s;ee it advancing with ha&s;ty &s;trides at this moment. The QUEEN's e&s;trangement, and the recollection of that vile kick in
<PB N="142" REF="162">the breech, have embittered all my enjoyments. My &s;hame &s;hall be wa&s;hed out in their blood. The thunder grumbles in the air, and &s;oon will fall to cru&s;h them. Our Countrymen, accu&s;tomed to inter|cour&s;e with the AMERICANS, talk the language of the&s;e Republicans, without under&s;tanding heir prin|ciples; and Redre&s;s of Grievances is now become the idea mo&s;t in fa&s;hion. My agents are every where, and never fail to traduce the KING and QUEEN as the principal cau&s;e of all the People's &s;ufferings, to de&s;cribe the Nobility and Clergy as their mortal enemies, and the DUKE OF ORLEANS alone as their &s;upport, their protector, and true friend.&mdash;
<PB N="143" REF="163">The Finances be&s;ides are in as fine a &s;tate of di&s;order as could be wi&s;h|ed, and all this working together mu&s;t infallibly conduct me to the Throne.</Q></P>
<P>AT that prophetic word we all drop|ped again upon our knees, and to&s;&s;ed off a full pint of Champagne each to its accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>AT length by the dint of wine, poli|tics, and prophecy, his Highne&s;s' head was entirely overturned, and down he &s;unk in his ea&s;y chair, &s;peechle&s;s and in&s;en&s;ible. The noi&s;e of his &s;noring, which &s;hook the dining-room, gave us the fir&s;t notice of the retreat of his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="164">His gold &s;nuff-box &s;et with dia|monds lay upon the table before him, and I was furiou&s;ly tempted to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but MENTOR diverted me from the intention, proving, by a &s;yllogi&s;m in <HI>Barbara,</HI> that the theft might be a hanging matter, and the detection inevitable. My rea&s;on, but not my will, agreed with him, and I relinqui&s;hed all future hopes of that amiable &s;nuff-box with deep regret, <HI>multa gemens,</HI> as ORPHEUS was obli|ged to re&s;ign his beloved EURYDICE at the borders of Tartarus, or as a &s;etting-dog at the call of his ma&s;ter leaves the half-mumbled partridge in the plains of Chantilly. "Farewel!" &s;ays I, "farewel! too charming &s;nuff-box!" So &s;aying, I &s;tole out of the apartment
<PB N="145" REF="165">on tiptoe, leaving the drunken land|lord in his arm-chair to &s;nore him&s;elf &s;ober, and dream at his ea&s;e of Thrones, Revolutions, and Popula|rity.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WISHED much to take leave of MARAT, that is, to get drunk with him, before I left PARIS; but it could
<PB N="147" REF="167">not be, he was again in the <HI>Salp&eacute;triere,</HI> to which he had been recommitted in five days after he had been di&s;charged from it. The SWISS are &s;aid to have a di&s;ea&s;e called the pining after their country; my PYLADES might be &s;aid to pine for the in&s;ide of a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>THOUGH there is not, perhaps, any &s;et of men in the community &s;o much addicted to parade, &s;how, and flutter, as the Members of the Diplomatic Body, I thought proper to avoid all o&s;tenta|tion in my preparations for my emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>OBSERVE all Amba&s;&s;adors, Pleni|potentiaries, or Envoys. When they return from their public character abroad, their equipage and dre&s;s are
<PB N="148" REF="168">more gaudy. They di&s;play a great deal of gilding and lace, more than you meet with among their equals. My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador &s;quares his elbows, &s;crapes his feet more again&s;t the floor, thru&s;ts his per&s;on more fully into your face; in &s;hort, he mu&s;ters up the whole turkey and peacock in his deportment, and is, in appearance, a man of greater con&s;equence than many of &s;uperior preten&s;ions who &s;tand in the &s;ame circle with him, but have not happened to pur&s;ue the &s;ame line with him in their progre&s;s through the world.&mdash; Gentry, in &s;hort, of this feather are perpeually in a &s;tate of declared war again&s;t nature and &s;implicity. All this may undoubtedly &s;pring from a lauda|ble jealou&s;y of not being overlooked at
<PB N="149" REF="169">foreign courts, or from a de&s;ire of doing honour to the country they repre&s;ent; but, in general, it is rather to be im|puted to their per&s;onal pride, than their public-&s;pirited patrioti&s;m. When men's actions and conduct will bear two con&s;tructions, one good and the other bad, he who does not a&s;cribe them to the latter mu&s;t be indeed a novice in human nature.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I had very &s;en&s;ible rea&s;ons for avoiding all &s;ort of o&s;tenta|tion in the preparations for my emba&s;|&s;y; my credentials being only to the <HI>Houghers</HI> and <HI>United Iri&s;hmen,</HI> I had no right to expect to be received in a public character by the whole IRISH nation.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="170">EQUIPPING my&s;el&s; only with a &s;mall quantity of linen, a &s;econd &s;uit of cloaths for gala days in a portmanteau, and a <HI>gard-vin</HI> well filled with coniac brandy, <HI>eau de Noyau, parfait amour,</HI> and other &s;trong cordials, I took po&s;t from PARIS, and on the fourth day arrived without any accident at DUNKIRK.</P>
<P>A MERCHANT-SHIP, bound for DUBLIN, was ju&s;t ready to &s;et &s;ail; and I embarked immediately. I found the ve&s;&s;el crowded with pa&s;&s;engers who had got on board before me. From this circum&s;tance I was in danger of being without a bed during the whole pa&s;&s;age, which calms or contrary winds might make long and tedious. But I
<PB N="151" REF="171">am of a temper rather to get the better of an inconvenience, than to complain of it.</P>
<P>AMONG a number of boobies who were on board, an overgrown middle-aged Smuggler, of mo&s;t in&s;ufferable &s;tupidity, attracted my notice. He blundered out whatever non&s;en&s;e hap|pened to come uppermo&s;t, told dull &s;tories and laughed at them perpetual|ly, and drank like a camel preparing to pa&s;s the De&s;art of ARABIA. He had an excellent bed. I &s;oon made an acquaintance with him. Opening my dram-che&s;t, I invited him in a bumper to drink <Q>Confu&s;ion to all Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers,</Q> and in another we drank "Pro&s;perity to Smuggling."</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="172">In order to fini&s;h him compleatly, I filled him a half-pint gla&s;s of <HI>parfait amour</HI> to his own good health; then, perceiving that his head and his heels began to &s;tagger, I courteou&s;ly invited him to take a turn or two upon the deck, a&s;&s;uring him he would be great|ly refre&s;hed by it. I helped him im|mediately up the gang-way; then, drawing him towards the gun-wale, with the fir&s;t heel the &s;hip made, I pu&s;hed him head foremo&s;t into the &s;ea, where he was &s;wallowed up for ever.</P>
<P>WHEN I was certain that it was too late to fi&s;h him up again, I told the Sailors of his misfortune, pretending to be concerned for it: I then took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bed, where I &s;lept &s;oundly,
<PB N="153" REF="173">and in great comfort, for the re|mainder of our voyage to DUBLIN. The inconceivable angui&s;h which pa&s;|&s;engers on board &s;uffer from the rol|ling of the &s;hip, having (as Mr. VOLTAIRE &s;ays) all the humours of the human frame thus violently forced out of their natural channels, made me at times a little peevi&s;h; but, having a good bed, and my mind entirely at ea&s;e, I thought I had no great right to complain much about &s;o &s;mall a matter. He who has pre&s;ence of mind may be truly faid to po&s;&s;e&s;s a trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>OUR voyage la&s;ted near a fortnight, and, but for the happy expedient which I have ju&s;t before related, there might I have been lying, &s;tretched on the floor
<PB N="154" REF="174">of the cabin, with my head, perhaps, &s;upported by a hard trunk or a ba&s;ket, while a pitiful Smuggler lay &s;noring at his ea&s;e, within a few yards of the never-enough-to-be-re&s;pected Amba&s;|&s;ador of his Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>MUCH has been &s;aid of the beauty of the Bay of DUBLIN; and to &s;peak truth, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay more of it than it de&s;erves. In fine weather, the &s;ea looks like a great lake of a tran&s;pa|rent blue colour, neither too contracted nor too exten&s;ive. The country round, particularly towards the county of WICKLOW, forms a magnificent am|phitheatre of hills and mountains ri&s;ing gradually above each other; the tops of &s;ome of them &s;eeming to pierce the
<PB N="155" REF="175">clouds like pyramids, the &s;ides of others &s;welled into beautiful bo&s;oms, then gently waving off, and expanded at la&s;t into &s;oft green vallies, which detain and captivate the eye with the mo&s;t deli|cious fre&s;hne&s;s and verdure. On their &s;lopes, and in the bottoms, you &s;ee villas and &s;ummer-hou&s;es without number, adorned all about with flow|ering &s;hrubs, and &s;heltered with young plantations. Old trees, or of a very large growth, are not common.&mdash; There is very where cultivation with|out formality, and rural wildne&s;s with|out &s;avagene&s;s or horror. The forms of the&s;e hills, mountains, and vallies, &s;o diver&s;ified and &s;o engaging, the &s;ea like a great lake, the promontory of HOWTH at the entrance of the Bay on
<PB N="156" REF="176">one, &s;ide, the &s;mall town of CLONTARF, and &s;everal other objects (could they be all together collected in a &s;ingle picture), would form, undoubtedly, one of the mo&s;t delightful land&s;capes imaginable.</P>
<P>THE City of DUBLIN, though of very great extent, yet &s;een from the Bay, or from any eminence, pre&s;ents nothing noble or beautiful to the eye of the beholder; and this proceeds entirely from the deficiency of towers, &s;pires, and &s;teeples. Of the&s;e I could count I think but two.</P>
<P>I WILL not he&s;itate to affirm, that the large&s;t city in the univer&s;e, with the mo&s;t &s;pacious and regular &s;treets, the mo&s;t uniform hou&s;es, the public
<PB N="157" REF="177">buildings in the mo&s;t grand &s;tyle, as are tho&s;e of DUBLIN, nay, allowing them to be all con&s;tructed of poli&s;h|ed marble, but de&s;titute of &s;teeples, &s;pires, and towers, will never make a &s;triking object of vi&s;ion, or fill the eye of a &s;pectator who looks at it from a di&s;tant view, and con&s;iders it only as a component part of a picture.</P>
<P>BESIDES the beauty which ari&s;es from a diver&s;ified &s;urface, without the aid of certain objects elevated above it, the &s;pace occupied appears much le&s;s than the reality; and for the&s;e rea|&s;ons the &s;ea is never &s;een to &s;uch advantage as when covered with &s;hip|ping; and we are always deceived in our conjectures as to the breadth of an
<PB N="158" REF="178">unbroken expan&s;e of water, the men|&s;uration con&s;tantly proving it to be con&s;iderably greater than was imagined before the experiment.</P>
<P>I FELT the mo&s;t lively &s;atisfaction in con&s;idering the paucity of the&s;e &s;tructures; for as erections of this kind generally belong to temples and churches, I immediately concluded that the inhabitants had little or no religion, and that if they were as indif|ferent to the interior of wor&s;hip as they &s;eemed to be to the out&s;ide, athei&s;m, and the enlightened impiety of our new Philo&s;ophy, would &s;oon make a thriving progre&s;ss among them. The God of Cards and Dice has a Temple, called DALY's, dedicated to his ho|nour
<PB N="159" REF="179">in DUBLIN, much more magnifi|cent than any Temple to be found in that City dedicated to the God of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>THE appearance of the Mob, who &s;warm on the Quays and block up the pa&s;&s;ages to the City, delighted me greatly. Covered with rags and dirt, without breeches, &s;hirts, or &s;hoes, full of animal &s;pirits, and the &s;pirit of whi&s;key, "Aye! aye!" &s;ays I, <Q>here is the true &s;tuff for Reformers! What a felicity mu&s;t it be to live under a Con&s;titution of their model|ling!</Q></P>
<P>ON advancing further into the City, and &s;eeing every thing &s;o different, my
<PB N="160" REF="180">&s;pirits &s;unk in proportion. Appear|ances were changed entirely: large &s;treets, &s;hops well furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of commodities, creditable hou&s;es, an excellent foot-way, public buildings (churches excepted) all magnificent, and hand&s;ome carriages rolling along, filled with mode&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful ladies. Alas! thought I, this does not look like the work of my Reformers; the Gentry, I fear, have got the be&s;t end of the &s;taff in this Capital: but, with the help of the Devil, let us never de&s;pair of any thing.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the hou&s;es in general, and particularly in the new &s;treets, are well fini&s;hed, chearful, and commo|dious, there are not many hotels in
<PB N="161" REF="181">DUBLIN of very extraordinary magni|tude. <HI>Lein&s;ter Hou&s;e</HI> however is very noble, and has more the air of a palace than any Hotel in Paris. <HI>Charlemount Hou&s;e</HI> is very &s;triking, (though not near &s;o large as the former) from the beauty of the architecture.</P>
<P>IN this Hou&s;e there is an apartment called the Library, which, from the collection of books, and the &s;tyle of the ornaments, would do honour to the ta&s;te of a Prince. I could not look at them without wi&s;hing it had been po&s;&s;ible for me to have &s;tolen half of them; but, alas! I had only the merit of feeling the inclination, for the thing was impracticable. His Lord&s;hip's gold watch lay by accident upon a
<PB N="162" REF="182">table, and, to make my&s;elf &s;ome re|compence for my other fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes, I &s;lipped it into my pocket, and then went away, making a thou|&s;and bows and acknowledgments to the footman who held the door in his hand for me. I kept the watch &s;ome time, as a plea&s;ing token to remind me of that beautiful Library, and of the mo&s;t re&s;ectable Nobleman who is the owner of it.</P>
<P>ON the day of my entry into DUB|LIN, I dined with Me&s;&s;ieurs HEROD and JUDAS, my Bankers. They re|ceived me very politely, and, after &s;eve|ral Jewi&s;h ceremonies which I regard|ed as little as if they had been Chri&s;|tian, they invited me to a family din|ner.

We dined heartily upon Pa&s;chal lamb and unleavened bread, and at every third mouthful drank "Confu&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity."</P>
<P>AT my reque&s;t (for I did not then know the con&s;equence) that Mi&s;s MUSHI would favour the company with a &s;ong, &s;he immediately began to &s;quall out a mo&s;t tedious and lamenta|ble Canticle, longer than half of DEU|TERONOMY; and, to complete the di&s;cord, &s;he every now and then clap|ped a confounded Jew's trump between

<P>I INTENDED toogle her all the time; but, unfortunately, my &s;quint turned all the tenderne&s;s to the mother, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to her.

<P><PB N="165" REF="186">A PARTY to the Play-hou&s;e was then propo&s;ed, and we walked off to|gether. I &s;ecured a place between the two Children of Circumci&s;ion, in the centre of the pit, from whence I could conveniently &s;ee both the &s;pectacle and the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>BEFORE the ri&s;ing of the curtain, the proceedings of the Upper-Gallery gave me infinite entertainment. Their cries and howlings were more furious and di&s;&s;onant than a troop of pent-up wolves. Now and then they dropped down emptied bottles on the company of the Pit, and yet not above three or four &s;kulls at mo&s;t were broken by them; then they flung chewed apples and orange peels at the boxes, and upon
<PB N="166" REF="187">the Stage: they frequently made the Ladies blu&s;h, and the Beaus tremble, hi&s;&s;ing or clapping them ju&s;t as the fancy was uppermo&s;t, and &s;ometimes giving them ludicrous nick-names, which were well under&s;tood, and in general very characteri&s;tical. In &s;hort, it was con&s;ummately plea&s;ant to ob|&s;erve how mi&s;erable they made all the decent-looking people in the Theatre.</P>
<P>THE Play to be acted, as the Bills informed us, was a Tragedy, but the greate&s;t part of the Actors &s;eemed not to have been admitted into that &s;ecret. They appeared entirely uncon&s;cious and unconnected with the bu&s;ine&s;s go|ing forward, and to a&s;&s;ume no &s;ort of re&s;pon&s;ibility for the pathetic incidents
<PB N="167" REF="188">exhibired before the audience. Had it not been for the energy of one per|former, for the frequent u&s;e of the dagger towards the cata&s;trophe, and, above all, for the &s;ympathy of &s;ome young ladies in the boxes, I might have retired from the Play-hou&s;e without knowing whether I ought to have left my mirth or my tears behind me.</P>
<P>THE beauty of the LADIES of IRE|LAND is perfectly enchanting. The pea&s;ant girls of ENGLAND are in gene|ral much prettier than tho&s;e of the &s;ame cla&s;s in this Country, but the LADIES here are full as hand&s;ome as ENGLISH Ladies, and no &s;tyle of beauty can exceed them. O God of Love! O Mother of the Graces! what &s;hapes!
<PB N="168" REF="189">what complexions! what features! what attractions! While I looked at them, I doubted for near the length of half a &s;cene whether, had it been ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I could have cut all their throats in cold blood, and as a gentle|man ought to do.</P>
<P>BUT this was not the wor&s;t; let me avow my &s;hame&mdash;would it had ended there. Seeing the &s;weetne&s;s of their looks, the angelic &s;erenity of their countenances, and their bewitching &s;en&s;ibility, I for a moment entertained the mean &s;u&s;picion that there might be &s;omething real in innocence and virtue, and that the&s;e fair creatures, without a &s;park of heroi&s;m in their compo&s;ition, and little ver&s;ed as they were in our new
<PB N="169" REF="190">fa&s;hionable philo&s;ophy, might, perhaps, enjoy as much internal &s;atisfaction, as much &s;olid contentment as even I could boa&s;t of. But this weakne&s;s was of no long duration&mdash;a moment's reflection bani&s;hed it. My brea&s;t recovered its u&s;ual firmne&s;s, and I &s;oon became again the worthy Amba&s;&s;ador of his Highne&s;s to the <HI>Houghers</HI> and <HI>United Iri&s;hmen.</HI></P>
<P>I MIGHT, no doubt, have &s;pared my&s;elf the &s;hame of the&s;e humiliating Confe&s;&s;ions, but I promi&s;ed to deal can|didly with the reader, &s;o I mean to conceal nothing from him.

<P>GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS, King of the Goths, who, mounted on his little white mare, was
<PB N="171" REF="192">killed by a mu&s;ket-&s;hot at the Battle of Lutzen, but not till after he had receiv|ed another wound which, as his heavy-headed hi&s;torian HARTE tells us, made him "decline from the perpendicular," &mdash;this good King u&s;ed to &s;ay, among other wife &s;ayings, that <Q>we &s;ee things better with our own eyes than with tho&s;e of other people.</Q> To this truth I fully &s;ub&s;eribe, in my capaity of Amba&s;&s;ador to the <HI>Hough|ers</HI> and <HI>United Iri&s;hmen.</HI></P>
<P>IN a country containing near four million of inhabitants, and where the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people are &s;o much addicted to idlene&s;s and drinking whi&s;key, who would not have expect|ed to find at lea&s;t one hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="172" REF="193">gallant de&s;peradoes under the two de|nominations before-mentioned? But mark the fact. As to the former, that enemy to all heroi&s;m the gallows had taken off &s;ome of them, and the fear of it di&s;couraging the re&s;t, that nur&s;ery of Reformers was rooted up, and exi&s;ted no longer. As to the latter, I could find but about five or fix who had any fixed habitation, and the&s;e, men in no e&s;teem, and of no &s;ort of con&s;equence; the re&s;t were poor bankrupt &s;hop|keepers, or idle fellows picked up in the &s;treets to be paraded through them on particular occa&s;ions, with a drum beating, and a fife whi&s;tling &s;omething like a march before them. A red or a blue coat was clapped upon their backs, and a mu&s;ket on their &s;houlders,
<PB N="173" REF="194">for the purpo&s;e of the day. After getting drunk with their officers at &s;ome alehou&s;e in the &s;uburbs, in the evening the red coat and the firelock were taken from them, they received thirteen-pence and a kick in the breech, and &s;o ended the campaign and the patrioti&s;m. The&s;e I found were but the mi&s;erable dregs and refu&s;e of the real VOLUNTEERS of IRELAND, who had for &s;ome time laid down their arms, and who indeed con&s;i&s;ted of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable gentry in the king|dom.</P>
<P>ALL this I mentioned in a confiden|tial letter to the Nephew of DAMIEN, but with a &s;trict injunction that he &s;hould not communicate a word of
<PB N="174" REF="195">the truth to his Highne&s;s, but keep him in his error, that I might be kept in my appointment; for I apprehended that my patron, who loved his money, would not chu&s;e the continuance of a con&s;iderable expence merely to im|prove my mind and manners by foreign travel.</P>
<P>THE DUKE, it &s;eems, depended for his intelligence upon one of the DUB|LIN New&s;papers, called the EVENING-POST. This was his Gazette and his Go&s;pel; and though it is only a com|pilation of gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations and fal&s;hoods, he believed in it implicitly. But that indeed is not wonderful, when many who are upon the &s;pot do the &s;ame. It may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort
<PB N="175" REF="196">of rever&s;e to the prophecies of CAS|SANDRA; it never tells truth, and is believed in general.</P>
<P>THE enemies of IRELAND are cer|tainly much obliged to the Editors of that Paper. It is the real ivory gate of intelligence, <Q><HI>fal&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad coelum mit|tens in&s;omnia,</HI></Q> and you might as well look for facts in the Arabian Nights Entertainments. Many of the good people of ENGLAND (that mo&s;t wi&s;e and credulous nation) al&s;o put their tru&s;t in its authenticity; but that is not &s;o extraordinary; for though there is a con&s;tant intercour&s;e between the two i&s;lands, and a narrow channel only &s;eparates them, the ENGLISH in general know le&s;s of the true &s;tate of
<PB N="176" REF="197">IRELAND than of POLAND, or the Empire of CHINA. I my&s;elf &s;aw a re|&s;pectable Merchant of MANCHESTER who came to DUBLIN in much fear, and as he thought in great peril, upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of importance which required his pre&s;ence, and who &s;eemed &s;urprized not to find the &s;treets barri|cadoed, and the whole country in a &s;tate of rebellion; for the EVENING-POST told him things would be &s;o &s;ituated in le&s;s than a fortnight.</P>
<P>EXCELLENT con&s;equences re&s;ult from this mi&s;repre&s;entation on one &s;ide, and this credulity on the other. The ENGLISHMAN, brave and open in the field, is cautious in the counting|hou&s;e, particularly with men of a
<PB N="177" REF="198">certain cla&s;s in IRELAND, who &s;eem to think they have a &s;ort of natural right to outwit him. His ca&s;h gets the cramp when he thinks of &s;ending it among men who laugh at him, and either remains at home, or goes to a di&s;tant market, to enrich traders le&s;s entitled than his neighbours to any advantage from him. It is computed that IRELAND lo&s;es annually at lea&s;t one hundred thou&s;and pounds by the patrioti&s;m of this &s;ingle New&s;paper.</P>
<P>No engine of mi&s;chief can perform its functions better. It defames all the re&s;pectable characters of the king|dom, and gives every virtue to the vile&s;t. It magnifies the failure of every &s;peculating &s;tock-jobber into
<PB N="178" REF="199">univer&s;al bankruptcy, and every paltry riot into general in&s;urrection. The &s;pirit of TOM PAINE &s;eems to pervade its paragraphs. Every evening it calls the King a Tyrant, and the Parliament a Ne&s;t of corrupt Traitors, bought with the money of the people to betray their intere&s;t, and ready to &s;ell them&s;elves and their po&s;terity to the Devil, let him but a&s;&s;ume the likene&s;s of a guinea to tempt them. All this and more is accompanied with con&s;tant complaints that the Pre&s;s has lo&s;t its Freedom, and that in &s;uch de&s;potic times no man dares to &s;peak or publi&s;h his &s;entiments. It reminded me of a Prie&s;t I heard preach at Paris again&s;t the idle vanities of the world, and who the whole time &s;eemed to be only intent upon di&s;play|ing
<PB N="179" REF="200">to the congregation a diamond ring which he wore upon his little finger.</P>
<P>I LIVED much, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, with the Editors and Friends of this admirable Paper, and now and then enriched it with e&s;&s;ays and paragraphs well calculated to rai&s;e a &s;pirit in the readers, which might be rewarded by the thanks of Colonel TANDY'S corps, or by an honourable appointment un|der Chief Ju&s;tice BARRINGTON in the BAY OF BOTANY.</P>
<P>ONE of my E&s;&s;ays in particular was &s;o uncommonly nervous, that MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL thought pro|per to take notice of it. The Editor was &s;eized, and immediately gave me
<PB N="180" REF="201">up as the Author. I was brought inte Court, and though every man is al|lowed Coun&s;el, provided he is able to pay for it, having before my eyes neither the &s;ear of GOD nor of bad Engli&s;h, I cho&s;e to plead for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I URGED in my defence, <Q>that I was a Patriot, and in what I publi&s;h|ed had only emulated the noble &s;pirit which appeared in all the pub|lications contained in the &s;ame Pa|per; that I could not conceive that to be an offence which I &s;aw done every day with impunity; that, in a free country, I imagined every man had a right to &s;peak and publi&s;h whatever he thought proper; and, la&s;tly, that if I had exceeded a little,
<PB N="181" REF="202">the motive was good, and my being a &s;tranger, I &s;uppo&s;ed, would be con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient apology.</Q></P>
<P>THE Court, I mu&s;t acknowledge, behaved with the utmo&s;t lenity. The Judge very mildly told me, <Q>That it was melancholy to con&s;ider how much evil re&s;ulted daily from unre|&s;trained licentiou&s;ne&s;s; that the Magi&s;trates were always unwilling to exerci&s;e any rigorous authority with which the &s;pirit of a free Con|&s;titution found it nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;t them; that though the utmo&s;t li|berty of &s;entiment and communica|tion was not only permitted but encouraged, yet this was always to be under&s;tood as being &s;ubject to &s;ome
<PB N="182" REF="203">decent and nece&s;&s;ary re&s;trictions; and that the good order and peace of the community were not to be di&s;turbed by the wild and extrava|gant notions which an individual might happen to entertain of liberty. However, my being a &s;tranger, as I had pleaded, might po&s;&s;ibly have led me into an error; that circum&s;tance would have weight with the Jury, and he would recommend to them not to find me guilty; hoping at the &s;ame time that I would be grateful for this lenity, and conduct my&s;elf for the future with more di&s;cre|tion.</Q></P>
<P>I MADE a bow, was &s;uffered to with|draw, and thus ended my trial, of
<PB N="183" REF="204">which I &s;ent out the following account in the &s;ame Paper next evening: <Q>ON Tue&s;day, between the hours of ten and eleven in the forenoon, &s;ix Police-men broke into the hou&s;e of the Editor of the EVENING-POST, and (by virtue of a warrant) carried off that gentleman, thus torn from the arms of his helple&s;s family, together with a mo&s;t re&s;pectable foreigner, Mr. JAMES BAPTISTE COUTEAU, who was &s;itting at breakfa&s;t with him. They were not &s;uffered to go into a coach, but dragged through the kennel in &s;ight of their indignant and in&s;ulted fel|low-citizens, and in this condition thru&s;t into the Dock of the Court
<PB N="184" REF="205">of King's Bench, unprepared for any &s;ort of defence, to take their trial for a libel. THE Judge behaved in the mo&s;t indecent manner, foaming at the mouth, loading them with the mo&s;t abu&s;ive language, charging the Jury to find them guilty, and &s;wearing that the Court would take care to &s;entence them to perpetual impri|&s;onment. Out of re&s;pect to the Court we forbear to enter more into particulars. The worthy Jury, however, did their duty, and ac|quitted them, to the infinite mortifi|cation of the Judges, and the inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of all pre&s;ent, the Bench excepted. The Hall
<PB N="185" REF="206">rung with applau&s;es, the di&s;charged Pri&s;oners were conducted home amid&s;t the &s;houts and acclamations of their fellow-citizens, the Judges' carriages were broke to pieces as they returned to their hou&s;es; and they would probably have lo&s;t their lives, but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the military, who appeared ju&s;t in time to &s;ave them from the fury of the ju&s;tly-incen&s;ed populace. WE hear a &s;ub&s;cription is opened to rai&s;e a &s;tatue in plai&s;ter of Paris, to be placed three &s;teps above that of Dr. LUCAS, on the &s;tairs leading to the Exchange Coffee-hou&s;e, the in&s;cription to be &s;imply this:&mdash;

<P>I TOOK care this Paper &s;hould be &s;afely tran&s;mitted to his Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>AN unfore&s;een event prevented my knowing the end of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and how the Court puni&s;hed this aggra|vated offence again&s;t its dignity. I might have had this &s;atisfaction without running any hazard, as I had previou&s;ly &s;ecured two Alibi-men (<HI>Doers,</HI> as it is called, of the Paper), to bear me harm|le&s;s &s;o the penalty would have fallen upon the Editor.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="208">AN Alibi-man is an hone&s;t Citizen, always to be found by the petty-foggers of ENGLAND and IRELAND, who extricates you immediately from the danger of a pro&s;ecution, by &s;wearing fal&s;ely upon the holy Go&s;pels to &s;ome circum&s;tance, commonly of locality, which makes it appear impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be guilty of the crime you have committed, and of which you &s;tand &s;pecifically indicted. The Alibi-man is applied to many good purpo&s;es, particularly to that of &s;aving highway|men; above half of the&s;e gentlemen e&s;caping on their trials by an Alibi.&mdash; His organs of &s;ight have this peculiar property, he never &s;ees you where you are, and always &s;ees you where you are not. In &s;hort, without &s;tirring
<PB N="188" REF="209">from his cellar or garret, he can, if nece&s;&s;ary, identify you at thirty leagues di&s;tance, and &s;o circum&s;tantially that he leaves no doubt of his veracity on the minds of his hearers. ROBE|SPIERRE, at my recommendation, in|vited over a little colony of them to &s;ettle at Paris; they have multiplied there greatly, and on many occa&s;ions we found them extremely &s;erviceable. They live chiefly upon rice &s;ome days before they &s;wear they have not &s;een you where you are, and u&s;e a good deal of cephalic &s;nuff before they &s;wear to have &s;een you where you was not; thus finding ingeniou&s;ly a &s;alvo for their con&s;ciences in the qualities of the&s;e two vegetables, which re &s;up|po&s;ed to blunt and &s;harpen the vi&s;ual
<PB N="189" REF="210">faculty. They &s;ay, and ju&s;tly, that if there be any thing to blame, it mu&s;t be imputed to the rice and &s;nuff, and not to any deficiency in their notions of moral rectitude.</P>
<P>A WAGER which I won, but was never paid, occa&s;ioned my leaving Dublin abruptly. My Alibi friends were much employed in endeavouring to write down the new Police E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the old Pari&s;h Watch, which had been for|merly the nocturnal Guard of the City.</P>
<P>THIS Watch, as it was called, con|&s;i&s;ted of decrepid old men, who &s;lept generally the be&s;t part of the night in
<PB N="190" REF="211">a wooden centry-box, and when they happened to be awake, crawled about, di&s;turbing the repo&s;e of per&s;ons who had a right to be a&s;leep, by thumping again&s;t the &s;treet-door with the end of their poles, and howling out the hour in a kind of ominous voice, which &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed of the melody of the a&s;s, the owl, and the raven. So far from imparting any idea of &s;ecurity to Hou&s;ekeepers by this &s;ort of noi&s;y vigilance, they only re|minded them, in ca&s;e of danger, how little they were to be depended upon. The Police pretty well an&s;wered the purpo&s;e for which they were e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and their being be&s;ides counte|nanced by the Government and Ma|gi&s;trates were &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for
<PB N="191" REF="212">the <HI>Doers</HI> of the EVENING-POST to carry on ho&s;tilities again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Two or three of the&s;e gentlemen de&s;cribing them to me as a formidable guard, able-bodied men, armed with a firelock and bayonet, I laid a bowl of punch again&s;t twenty folio volumes of the EVENING-POST, which they a&s;|&s;ured me was a great curio&s;ity, and the only collection of that Paper ex|tant, that I would that night kill one of the&s;e bugbears, and &s;leep unmo|le&s;ted afterwards, and they might be eye-witne&s;&s;es of it. After a few gla&s;&s;es of brandy, at the <HI>Cap of Liberty,</HI> in <HI>Fetter-lane,</HI> we left our liquor to determine the wager.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="213">ON one of the quays I came clo&s;e up to one of the nightly Guard. I a&s;ked him what was the hour, and while he was looking up at the moon, which perhaps he mi&s;took for the &s;un, to give me an an&s;wer, I &s;truck my dagger into his throat, and down he tumbled. His &s;tation happened to be near the corner of a &s;treet; the noi&s;e of his arms clattering on the pavement made five or &s;ix pa&s;&s;engers ha&s;ten towards the &s;pot, who, &s;eeing the dead body, immediately roared out, "Police" and "Murder".</P>
<P>As my two Alibi companions had not perhaps lately prepared them&s;elves with rice or cephalic &s;nuff, I thought it &s;afer to tru&s;t to my heels than to their te&s;timony. With the &s;peed
<PB N="193" REF="214">which fear and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation lent me, I &s;oon out&s;tripped my pur&s;uers. I ran along the quays, and luckily found a boat ju&s;t ready to put off with a few pa&s;&s;engers, who were to be con|veyed down the river to a trading ve&s;&s;el which was at the moment, with a gentle breeze in her favour, &s;ailing out of the harbour.</P>
<P>I SOON mounted to the deck, and, like MARY STUART while the coa&s;t of FRANCE receded from her view, looking back upon DUBLIN, "Fare|well, &s;ays I, <Q>dear City! with thy good-natured gentry, thy noble public buildings, and thy beautiful ladies; with thy low-back'd cars in&s;tead of waggons; thy five coffee|hou&s;es;

<PB N="198" REF="219">I was &s;ome time a little perplexed as to an option, I re&s;olved finally to di&s;ap|point neither. Their per&s;ons being equally di&s;gu&s;ting, a &s;ingle &s;hekel more or le&s;s on one &s;ide than the other would have immediately determined my pre|ference. Mrs. JUDAS had a large command of ready money, of which I could always po&s;&s;e&s;s my&s;elf, either by my own addre&s;s, or the old lady's fondne&s;s, and Mr. NEBUCHODONEZER PISGAH, maternal uncle to Mi&s;s MUSHI, had left the young one a con|&s;iderable fortune, in bonds, jewels, pawns, and balm of Gilead, indepen|dent of the power of any of the family.</P>
<P>THE partiality the good Banker felt for me originated, in a great mea&s;ure,
<PB N="199" REF="220">from a mi&s;take. He was him&s;elf a rigid ob&s;erver of the Law of MOSES, and &s;oon di&s;covering me not to be a Chri&s;tian, he imagined I was inclined to be a Jew. This is a common error. A man finds you not of the religion of your country, or of that where he hap|pens to meet you, &s;o he wrongly con|cludes that you may be of his, or of &s;ome other per&s;ua&s;ion; whereas it would be more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that you are of no religion, <HI>Nullius addictus jur are in verba magi&s;tri.</HI></P>
<P>No man can po&s;&s;ibly prevent the mi&s;taken notions which may be form|ed of him; and though I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to admit any religious &s;enti|ment, I can by no means be an&s;wer|able
<PB N="200" REF="221">for what weakne&s;s others (e&s;pe|cially &s;uch as don't know me inti|mately) may think proper to impute to me. Again&s;t &s;uch unfounded ca|lumnies I &s;hall not enter into a &s;erious vindication, nor &s;hall I &s;ay, as the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hop WARBURTON to a &s;uppo&s;ed defamer of his moral charac|ter, <HI>Mentiris impudenti&s;&s;ime;</HI> but I &s;hall an&s;wer boldly, <Q>Look at my life, and there read your refutation.</Q>&mdash; But enough, perhaps, on this &s;ubject; let me only ju&s;t add, that I have not concealed &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es as I know are in my nature, but I may &s;a&s;ely a&s;&s;ert that an addiction to any &s;ort of &s;uper&s;tition or holy reverence was never among the number.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="222">As the ve&s;&s;el we &s;ailed in was large, and not crowded with pa&s;&s;engers, I did not find it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;po&s;e of any of them, as I had done of the Smuggler from Dunkirk. The Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, an ENGLISHMAN, was a heavy &s;ort of being, who &s;eemed to mind little more than the navigation of the ve&s;&s;el, keeping her whole&s;ome, the failors regular, and taking care the pa&s;&s;engers &s;hould be well &s;upplied with every thing they had a right to expect from him. I conceived a mean opinion of his under&s;tanding, from knowing that he read the Bible every morning alone for near a quarter of an hour, and that for more than twice that time the &s;hip's company were obliged to li&s;ten to it every Sunday.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="223">I ATTEMPTED to rally him upon this weakne&s;s, but to no purpo&s;e. He had &s;ome whim&s;ical notions about the Bible; &s;aid it was his rudder and com|pa&s;s; that without it he &s;hould not have known in &s;teering which was right or wrong, to tack to larboard or &s;tar|board; that it was the true log-book, where he kept his &s;oul's reckoning; many a chart had failed him, but that never had; and that he verily believed it had more than once &s;aved him from drowning.</P>
<P>I OFFERED to lay him a wager, that let him take any man of the &s;hip who could not &s;wim, and throw him overboard with the Bible tied round his neck, and he would &s;oon
<PB N="203" REF="224">go to the bottom in &s;pite of that amulet. "YOUNG Man," he an&s;wered, <Q>there are &s;ubjects enough for merri|ment, without making a je&s;t of the Bible.</Q></P>
<P>PRETENDING to be affected by what he &s;aid, and to have &s;ome re&s;pect for his folly, at times I borrowed it from him, and it an&s;wered a very good purpo&s;e; for, becoming better ac|quainted with it, I was better enabled to quote and to laugh at it. Many men venture to do both, without having read one chapter.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="225">HAD I not been copper-bottomed again&s;t the worm of &s;uper&s;tition, I might perhaps have felt &s;ome little degree of reverence for the Captain's holy log-book, for two or three times we met with fierce &s;torms, and were in great peril; in&s;omuch that all on board, my&s;elf among the number, were petrified with terror, except the Scripture-believing Captain&mdash;he alone kept the deck, firm, compo&s;ed, and undaunted, and there is rea&s;on to think, from his pre&s;ence of mind, that he &s;aved us all from peri&s;hing. He was a native of NORFOLK&mdash;his name WYNDHAM.</P>
<P>WHEN the weather was tolerable, this hone&s;t Believer, my&s;elf, and two
<PB N="205" REF="226">others, u&s;ed to make a party at whi&s;t for two or three hours in the evening, and I was always &s;ucce&s;sful; for which I &s;hould have been thankful to Fortune, had I not con&s;tantly taken care to put the event out of her power. My adver&s;aries were much more &s;urpri&s;ed than I was, at finding they could never win a &s;ingle rubber. Whenever I dealt, which I often did out of my turn, I took care to give my&s;elf and my partner three or four kings and queens, and to convey an ace or two from the hands again&s;t us, in&s;tead of an equal number of duces or threes from my own. A looker-on, a &s;tranger to whi&s;t, would never have imagined that we played with the &s;ame pack of cards, which ought to have been dealt
<PB N="206" REF="227">promi&s;cuou&s;ly, but that the game con|&s;i&s;ted in our holding all the high cards, and our adver&s;aries the &s;mall. By &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary precautions, had there been a &s;uperiority of &s;kill on the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide, I could have &s;uffered no great di&s;advantage from it.</P>
<P>IT is not perhaps univer&s;ally known, that in our rage for pulling down Sovereigns, and equalizing all human things, we not only dethroned our own King and Queen, but that the Kings of Spades, Clubs, Hearts, and Dia|monds, with their Royal Con&s;orts, &s;hared the &s;amefate. If any FRENCH|MAN, e&s;pecially an Ari&s;tocrate, were now to pre&s;ume to call the&s;e <HI>ci-devant</HI> Kings by any other title than Citizen Spade,
<PB N="207" REF="228">Citizen Club, Heart, or Diamond, and the former Queens by any other name than that of Wife to any of the afore|&s;aid Citizens, he would be denounced to the Convention, and lo&s;e his head by the guillotine on a &s;caffold.</P>
<P>THIS refinement of Civici&s;m we owe originally to the minute but meritorious attention of our Adjutant-General PUTHOD. Willing that he &s;hould not lo&s;e the honour due to &s;o great a Reformation in the State, I have taken extracts from his letter on this important &s;ubject, pub|li&s;hed in the PARIS CHRONICLE of 8 December 1792, in the fir&s;t year of the Republic. Let Kings and Queens tremble while they read it. The Kings
<PB N="208" REF="229">and Queens of Spades indeed, and their Royal Colleagues, will not affect in|difference to it, and probably it will have more effect on the other Crowned Heads of the univer&s;e. On the &s;ubject of Cards thus writes our Adjutant-General <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are real extracts from a paper &s;igned PUTHOD, Adjutant-General, and publi&s;hed as mentioned in the text. Such ab&s;urd affectation and pedantry are hardly credible. Who but a FRENCH Republican could be capable of them?</NOTE>:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>WHAT do I not &s;uffer at pre&s;ent from that amu&s;ement! it makes me quarrel with the pretty women.&mdash; One hears for ever, "I have got the King&mdash;I have got the Queen."&mdash;
<PB N="209" REF="230">As I feel my&s;elf offended at the&s;e denominations, I expre&s;s my di&s;gu&s;t at it. The good people of FRANCE be|ing re&s;olved to have Kings and Queens no longer in their Government, why &s;hould they &s;uffer them in their Games? Let us be Republicans even in our &s;ports. After we have manife&s;ted the greate&s;t rage and hatred again&s;t the King and Queen, while we are labouring by all po&s;&s;i|ble means to prejudice the Public Mind and their Judges again&s;t them, at this critical moment when their fair Trials are depending, with what con&s;i&s;tency can we at the &s;ame time &s;it down to a game where we &s;hew &s;uch fondne&s;s for Kings and Queens, nay where we pique our&s;elves upon
<PB N="210" REF="231">the advantages we gain by Royal Artifice and Royal De&s;poti&s;m?&mdash; There &s;hould be &s;ome Reform, &s;ome &s;ub&s;titution.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>(Signed) PUTHOD, <HI>Adjutant-General.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>To &s;hew that the vigilant delicacy of this eminent Republican was not in vain; there being a Royal Owl, a Royal Eagle, and a Royal Tyger, in the <HI>Menagerie</HI> at Chantilly, I my&s;elf moved in full Convention, and it was unanimou&s;ly voted, that they &s;hould be immediately equalized; and they are now called Citizen Owl, Citizen Eagle, and Citizen Tyger, and we hear from the Keepers that they &s;eem to be very well reconciled to it.&mdash;
<PB N="211" REF="232">This al&s;o was a con&s;iderable Reforma|tion.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to Cards, we mu&s;t acknowledge, that Kings and Queens, though not to be tolerated upon Thrones, are in a hand at Whi&s;t very &s;erviceable, and that whether they may be called Kings and Queens, or &s;imply Citizens and their Wives, it is be&s;t to have them. I know no better way of doing it than that which I have already mentioned. I learned the &s;ecret from an ingenious Citizen Juggler, called BRESLAW.</P>
<P>BY &s;uch dexterity I not only con|trived to win enough to defray the charges of my pa&s;&s;age, but to pay all
<PB N="212" REF="233">my expences during my &s;hort con|tinuance at BOSTON, where, after a rough and &s;ometimes and dangerous voy|age of near &s;even weeks, we found our|&s;elves &s;afely landed.</P>
<P>AT my entrance into the town, I expected to meet with &s;ome immediate indications of that happy &s;pecies of Government which the AMERICANS had lately adopted; to &s;ee &s;ome hou&s;es on fire, others given up to pillage; Politicians in every Coffee-hou&s;e find|ing fault with the Magi&s;trates, and new-modelling the Con&s;titution&mdash;in &s;hort, to &s;ee the free &s;pirit of liquor and licentiou&s;ne&s;s acting their vagaries every-where. The a&s;pect of things was very different. An air of &s;tillne&s;s
<PB N="213" REF="234">and quiet, almo&s;t to melancholy, &s;truck a damp into my &s;pirits; few people in the &s;treets, and the&s;e either carrying burdens, or walking &s;oberly about their bu&s;ine&s;s; no hou&s;es on fire, and hardly a word of politics or Reforma|tion mentioned. Our pro&s;e Poet FENELON's de&s;cription of ancient TYRE may be applied to BOSTON: <Q>ONE could not meet there, as in other Cities, inqui&s;itive and idle people, who &s;trolled about to public places, a&s;king after news, or gaping at &s;trangers who happened to arrive in the harbour. The men were employ|ed either in unloading their ve&s;&s;els, in tran&s;porting their merchandize, or in making bargains; in arranging
<PB N="214" REF="235">their warehou&s;es, or in taking an exact account of the debts due to them by foreign merchants. The women were not le&s;s indu&s;trious in occupations &s;uitable to their &s;ex and ingenuity.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT was to be done? To think of reforming this place by my&s;elf was a vain imagination. It occurred to me that in a town containing fourteen or fifteen thou&s;and people, notwith&s;tand|ing appearances to the contrary, there mu&s;t be &s;ome latent &s;parks of di&s;con|tent, and that the di&s;ciples of TOM PAINE would be well inclined to lend their breath with mine to blow them up to the glorious flame of outrage and commotion.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="236">I WAS not mi&s;taken. It was not difficult to find what I wanted. I &s;oon made acquaintance with half a dozen PAINEITES, who&s;e vinegar a&s;pects were immediately di&s;tingui&s;hable. Being poor, &s;peculative, and idle, I found them of cour&s;e full of di&s;content, and abounding with theories of Reforma|tion. Their &s;y&s;tem indeed generally went no further than to the un&s;ettling whatever was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which they illu&s;trated by de&s;cribing certain ma|chines, where if you pull out the prin|cipal pins the whole work falls at once to pieces. They proved very inge|niou&s;ly that men could never be judges of their own happine&s;s; that &s;uch as were &s;atisfied with what was called the liberty allowed by the nece&s;&s;ary regu|lations
<PB N="216" REF="237">of civilized &s;ociety, were actually in a &s;tate of &s;lavery; and that tho&s;e who did not ri&s;e upon their rulers could never be con&s;idered as philo&s;o|phers, or de&s;erve the thanks of remote po&s;terity, which was a much more rational object than &s;ecuring the wel|fare of the exi&s;ting generation.</P>
<P>THESE were men exactly &s;uited to my purpo&s;es. We went into Coffee|hou&s;es, and began by endeavouring to depreciate the merits of General WASH|INGTON. We complained that, under a Government called Republican, he was inve&s;ted with more power and authority than the Laws of ENGLAND allowed to the King of GREAT-BRIN|TAIN. What could be more tame and
<PB N="217" REF="238">de&s;picable than the regularity and deco|rum of public wor&s;hip, when men who did not &s;requent churches or meeting-hou&s;es, and who &s;coffed at religion, &s;o far from being re&s;pected for it, were held rather in le&s;s e&s;teem than tho&s;e who &s;aid their prayers, and complied with the in&s;ipid forms of e&s;tabli&s;hed orthodoxy? At the end of di&s;cour&s;es of this nature we looked round at the bye&s;tanders, and were not a little di&s;appointed to perceive that they either regarded us with contempt, or walked off from the place without conde&s;cending to enter into any argu|ment with us.</P>
<P>AFTER about a week pa&s;&s;ed in this manner, my door was one morning
<PB N="218" REF="239">opened by a plain formal-looking man dre&s;&s;ed in brown, who, with very little ceremony, informed me, he was come, by command of the A&s;&s;embly, to order me to leave BOSTON immediately; that a &s;hip was to &s;ail from thence for PORT L'ORIENT next day; that money would be &s;urni&s;hed for my expences to any part of FRANCE on my landing; and that had it not been for their re&s;pect for my country, to which they thought them&s;elves obliged on a late occa&s;ion, my intemperance of tongue would have been rewarded by impri&s;onment or the pillory. "In this manner," he added, <Q>were we obliged to di&s;mi&s;s that mi&s;chievous coxcomb PAINE, who&s;e jargon, it &s;eemeth, friend! thou ha&s;t adopted.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="240">I ANSWERED with &s;pirit, <Q>that I would take their money, though I de&s;pi&s;ed it; and that they de&s;erved to be le&s;t in their ignorance, for not knowing how to treat their benefac|tors</Q></P>
<P>FROM &s;uch benefactors as thee," replied he, <Q>good LORD deliver us! But come thou no more into AME|RICA or wor&s;e will betide thee!</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aying, he adju&s;ted his beaver, and, with the &s;tiffne&s;s of a brown po&s;t &s;et in motion, &s;talked out of the cham|ber. To &s;hew my indifference, I clapped the door two or three times loudly after him, and hummed a tune called "Yankee Doodle."</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="241">IN le&s;s than half an hour I was conducted to a boat, between two con|&s;tables, and &s;afely depo&s;ited on board <HI>The Friendly Reception.</HI> My pa&s;&s;age from BOSTON was &s;o like my naviga|tion to it, that a minute detail of parti|culars could not entertain my readers. For more than a month I had little amu&s;ement except what I could &s;ind in cheating at cards, and heartily cur&s;ing all the AMERICANS by Stripes, by Provinces, and Individuals, from Ge|neral WASHINGTON downwards, not forgetting my Automaton in brown who denounced to me my expul&s;ion from AMERICA.</P>

<P>ISPENT not an hour at Port L'Orient more than was nece&s;&s;ary to receive the money promi&s;ed me for my
<PB N="222" REF="243">travelling expences, and to hire a good chai&s;e to convey me to Paris. While the BOSTONIAN was counting out the ca&s;h, I was employed in whi&s;tling "Yankee Doodle," and in cur&s;ing CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS for having di&s;covered AMERICA. The Puritan looked at me with di&s;dain, but only an&s;wered that I was a foul-mouthed ruffian, beneath the notice of any thing in a human &s;hape except the hangman.</P>
<P>ON my arrival at Paris I learned from ROBESPIERRE, who was ju&s;t relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, where he had left MARAT in con&s;inement for three months longer, that the fir&s;t Prince of the Blood had been for &s;ome time in London.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="244">"HE is gone there," &s;ays he, <Q>with one of tho&s;e fine projects which get into his head like infected people into a pe&s;t-hou&s;e, becau&s;e they will be no where el&s;e admit|ted; and what think you is it? No le&s;s than to per&s;uade the Mini&s;ters of ENGLAND to begin another war with FRANCE, promi&s;ing to deliver into their hands Bre&s;t and Brittany, provided they will engage to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in depo&s;ing our King LOUIS, and rai&s;ing his Mo&s;t Serene High|ne&s;s to the throne in&s;tead of him. Now pray ob&s;erve with proper re|&s;pect, the abundance of ab&s;urdities with which this &s;cheme is pregnant. Fir&s;t, our patron is neither a&s;&s;ured of the di&s;affection of the people of
<PB N="224" REF="245">Brittany, nor of the di&s;loyalty of the Governors of that Province; and the whole Marine hold him in contempt for his cowardce, of which too many of them have been witne&s;&s;es. After having behaved ill at &s;ea, he re&s;olved to wa&s;h out the memory of his di&s;grace on one element, by &s;hewing he could be more frightened upon another; but you know the epigrams, and his poltroonery is a trite topic. His Balloon expedition only &s;erved to fix the &s;eal to his for|mer character. A fearful man may have a hundred good qualities, but he ought not to attempt to be a hero. So much for his ground in FRANCE! As to ENGLAND, the people there were tired of the la&s;t
<PB N="225" REF="246">war long before its conclu&s;ion, and are but ju&s;t beginning to re&s;pire from it: be&s;ides, to &s;peak &s;incerely, I believe that nation is &s;till &s;o infect|ed with the old vulgar exploded no|tions of good faith, honour, and loyalty, that I am per&s;uaded, not|with&s;tanding the provocation we have given them to retaliate, they would fooli&s;hly &s;corn to avail them|&s;elves of any advantage over our country by what they would weakly call ba&s;ene&s;s and treachery. As to you, my dear and mo&s;t re&s;pectable friend! the DUKE having left no provi&s;ion for you, and to beg or work being beneath a Gentleman, you mu&s;t of cour&s;e, you know,
<PB N="226" REF="247">either rob or &s;tarve. Should you be detected in the former, we have now no ORLEANS pre&s;ent to &s;ave you from the wheel or the gibbet; but while I am your conductor&mdash; <HI>Teucro duce, et au&s;pice Teucro,</HI>&mdash; fear nothing. A PARTICULAR friend of mine, the MARQUIS OF FAUXJEU, &s;ets out immediately for LONDON, and wants a companion and valet-de-chambre to attend him. I will recommend you. The MARQUIS has as good a right to his rank as half the titles in Paris; that is to &s;ay, though he has no e&s;tate, he has letters of nobility written by him&s;elf, and he makes as creditable an appearance by the &s;ums
<PB N="227" REF="248">he wins by cards and loaded dice, as any landlord in FRANCE by the reve|nue of his mills, his corn, or his vineyards. Three years ago the MARQUIS was a Pa&s;try-cook at Amiens, and but ye&s;terday he dined upon another Cook's <HI>pat&eacute;s</HI> at COMTE D'ARTOIS' table. The MARQUIS finds the Police here are beginning to grow a little peery about him, and as there is nothing he di&s;likes more than an&s;wering impertinent que&s;tions, he is deter|mined to fet off to-morrow for another kingdom, where there is le&s;s curio&s;ity and more money. As he knows I am acquainted with his hi&s;tory, he can refu&s;e me nothing, &s;o make ready for your journey.&mdash;
<PB N="228" REF="249">He will play his own cards in London, and we need not wi&s;h him good fortune, for he always carries that Godde&s;s about with him in his pocket. I am certain you will be very happy together, and when you have lei&s;ure I &s;hall be glad to hear that you are &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>I THANKED the Nephew of DAMIEN, and then made &s;ome enqui|ries about our friends, particularly about the Members of our Subterra|neous Society.</P>
<P>"ALAS!" an&s;wered he, <Q>of mo&s;t of them I can only &s;ay as TULLY did of the CATILINARIANS, "they lived;" their God, the Devil, played
<PB N="229" REF="250">fal&s;e with them; their noble bones are &s;till pre&s;erved in iron, but you mu&s;t a&s;k the kites and ravens what is become of the re&s;t of their carca&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>"BRAVE Souls!" cried I; <Q>they died no doubt as men &s;hould do; no whining, no repentance.</Q></P>
<P>"No," &s;ays MENTOR, <Q><HI>quales ab incepto,</HI> all drunk, cur&s;ing the prie&s;ts who attended them, je&s;ting with the crucifix, and denying the facts for which they &s;uffered. I &s;aw the execution of mo&s;t of them, and &s;hould have been pre&s;ent at them all; but unluckily I was obliged ju&s;t at the time to attend my own trial for twoor three forgeries, and &s;hould have
<PB N="230" REF="251">&s;hared their fate, had not the intere&s;t of the good DUKE &s;aved me.</Q></P>
<P>"FORTUNATE enough!" &s;ays I; "and is PAINE hanged too?"</P>
<P>"NOT yet," replied MENTOR; <Q>but though as yet he has only brought his friends to the gallows, he is I think &s;cribbling his own way to it with great certainty. When|ever he dies, he will be found, not, like his hero CATILINE, <HI>inter ho&s;|tium</HI> but <HI>inter amicorum cadavera,</HI> for his pen is likely to be as fatal to his partizans, as the &s;word of that gallant ROMAN was to his enemies. But farewel! I have bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash; Should you get to &s;peak with the
<PB N="231" REF="252">DUKE in LONDON, try to ha&s;ten him over, for you may a&s;&s;ure him from me that things here are drawing to a cri&s;is.</Q></P>
<P>BEING re&s;olved to pay a vi&s;it to TOM PAINE before I waited upon the MAR|QUIS, I detained MENTOR for a mo|ment to get a direction to the former's garret, and then we parted.</P>
<P>I FOUND TOM's habitation in one of the dirtie&s;t Quays of Paris. The &s;itu|ation might have plea&s;ed HORACE, that great Lyric Poet, for there was no|thing to prevent his &s;triking his &s;ub|lime head again&s;t the &s;tars but a decayed roof of lath and plai&s;ter. This great Theori&s;t was &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on
<PB N="232" REF="253">a deal-board, and when I entered was working intently at a pair of blue canva&s;s jumps. His board was &s;trewed over with thread, tape, whalebone, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, parchment mea&s;ures, a bit of chalk, a bit of bees wax, and a thimble. Among the&s;e implements of his occu|pation I &s;aw a pen and ink, and an ENGLISH Spelling-book, and &s;everal pieces of coar&s;e ill-coloured paper, &s;erawled over with different titles; &s;uch as, "Common Sen&s;e," "Rights of Man", "Letter to DOCTOR PRIEST|LEY", "TO LORD S"&mdash;", and many others, written &s;o indi&s;tinctly that I could not read them.</P>
<P>HE received me rather kindly, in|vited me to &s;it by him on the board,
<PB N="233" REF="254">and &s;hook me by the hand as a brother-member of the Club of Demigods. As I could &s;peak Engli&s;h, and he &s;hewed no unwillingne&s;s to talk of his own affairs, we conver&s;ed for above half an hour very freely.</P>
<P>IT gave me &s;ome &s;mall degree of concern to hear that his &s;ituation was upon the whole very uncomfortable. The DUKE OF ORLEANS, he told me, allowed him a &s;mall pen&s;ion, but it was &s;o ill paid as to be hardly worth his acceptance: his writings, he &s;aid, brought him in but little; for what with paying a kind of a &s;cholar to take care of the &s;pelling and grammar, and another for tran&s;lating them into the French language, a &s;mall pittance
<PB N="234" REF="255">indeed came to his portion. His be&s;t reliance was upon his needle&mdash;the women of the neighbourhood liked his work, and though he &s;eldom made a pair of &s;tays, he had a good deal to do in the way of mending.</P>
<P>"BUT", added he; <Q>the good effects which I &s;ee produced by my writings con&s;ole me for everything. Before the people of this quarter began to &s;tudy my pamphlets, they were the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s, chearful, happy beings imaginable. They eat their <HI>&s;oupe</HI> with a good appetite, and, as DOCTOR GOLDSMITH &s;ays, "Trimmed their robes of frieze with copper lace", &s;ung, danced, and chattered without cea&s;ing; but not &s;o now&mdash;they
<PB N="235" REF="256">neglect their dre&s;s, &s;leep ill, quarrel with their neighbours, envy the rich, abu&s;e their King, and hate the Clergy. In &s;hort, they are become &s;o moro&s;e, &s;o &s;peculative, and &s;o melancholy, that they find now no reli&s;h in any thing. Hardly a week pa&s;&s;es that three or &s;our don't throw them&s;elves into the river, and the gaol is of late twice as full of pri|&s;oners as was ever before remem|bered. This you &s;ee, my friend, is the way to turn a nation of mon|kies into a nation of philo&s;ophers; and when &s;ociety is, as it ought to be, brought back to a &s;tate of na|ture; when the lordly &s;avage Man, is again his own ma&s;ter, without any re&s;traint from laws divine or
<PB N="236" REF="257">human upon his appetites, then I &s;ay, let not TOM PAIE be forgot|ten</Q></P>
<P>HERE he ended, and we ro&s;e from the board together. I &s;lipped into his hand a piece of &s;ix livres. Ob&s;erving he had no &s;hirt, I promi&s;ed that even|ing to &s;end him a couple, a&s;&s;uring him I could do it without any inconve|nience, as I always for the &s;uture in|tended to wear my Ma&s;ter's. He thanked me, &s;at down again to his needle, and I repaired to the lodgings of my new ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THERE could hardly be imagined a greater contra&s;t than between the ENGLISH Philo&s;opher's garret and the
<PB N="237" REF="258">apartment of the FRENCH MARQUIS. All was mi&s;ery in the former, and in the latter all was magnificence.</P>
<P>WHEN I was u&s;hered in to his Lord|&s;hip, I found him under the hands of his Hair-dre&s;&s;er, &s;tudying a little trea|ti&s;e upon the calculation of chances. He &s;tarted a little at &s;eeing me (an impre&s;&s;ion which the fir&s;t &s;ight of my figure often occa&s;ions), but &s;oon re|collected him&s;elf; and upon hearing my name, "Aye, aye," &s;ays he, <Q>you are the young man for whom MONSIEUR DE ROBESPIERRE inte|re&s;ts him&s;elf; that is &s;ufficient. But come, take the comb from PICARD, and let us &s;ee a little of your per|formance.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="259">I DID as he ordered me, and u&s;ed PICARD'S in&s;trument &s;o much le&s;s like a comb than a harrow, that the MAR|QUIS, bending and groaning beneath it, was &s;oon obliged to cry out for mercy, and PICARD fini&s;hed the ope|ration.</P>
<P>As I looked a little di&s;concerted, he told me it was no great matter; I was to con&s;ider my&s;elf rather as his com|panion than his &s;ervant; though I could not dre&s;s hair, I under&s;tood Engli&s;h, which to him was of more con&s;e|quence; and many a man could make a cake who could not make a pa&s;ty.</P>
<P>UPON better acquaintance with the MARQUIS, I found all his conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="239" REF="260">tinctured with his two vocations, the Pa&s;try-cook and the Game&s;ter.&mdash; When he was in danger of being detected by cheating at play too open|ly, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>That he had like to have overheated the oven;</Q> or, <Q>Make the cru&s;t brown, but don't burn it.</Q> When I flattered him (as I often did) too gro&s;sly, the reproof was, <Q>Too much &s;ugar in a tart is as bad as too much acid.</Q> All his vexations were typified by ill luck at play&mdash;&s;uch as, "Lurch him at four"&mdash; <Q>He had rather lo&s;e a louis d'or to a livre</Q>&mdash; <Q>May I be found out at a renounce with the game in my hand,</Q> and &s;uch like; &s;o that an ob&s;erver might &s;oon di&s;cover the Man of Fa&s;hion and the Marquis were but a&s;&s;umed characters,
<PB N="240" REF="261">and the Cook and the Game&s;ter were the real. Upon the whole, however, he was good-tempered; had much the appearance of a Gentleman; and, like the COMTE DE GRAMMONT, except that he always cheated at cards and dice, was a Man of &s;trict Honour.</P>
<P>As his trunks were already all fa&s;|tened to the chai&s;e with his heavy baggage, the keys of which he deli|vered to me at night, we had nothing to do but to throw our&s;elves into the vehicle next morning. We &s;et off from Paris with two &s;ervants mounted, and four hor&s;es to our carriage; and, lolling at our ea&s;e, be&s;pattered many a <HI>Croix de St. Louis,</HI> who&s;e whole yearly income would not have been &s;ufficient
<PB N="241" REF="262">to defray the expences of the MAR|QUIS to Calais.</P>
<P>HE &s;tepped into the chai&s;e with a &s;mall box under his arm, which he &s;aid contained his fortune; <Q>and that Pye, &s;mall as it looked, was better worth opening than all the re&s;t put together.</Q>&mdash;This &s;hort characteri&s;tic encomium immediately excited an appetite in me to ta&s;te the contents of it; and the poor MARQUIS found to his co&s;t, not very long after|wards, that I knew how to reli&s;h a good thing as well as him&s;elf, though I was not like him bred a Pa&s;try-cook.</P>
<P>AFTER we got to Calais, four hours and a half carried us from our own
<PB N="242" REF="263">country into a better. It is &s;trange that the &s;eparation of a few leagues of &s;alt water &s;hould make &s;uch a dif|ference between two nations. It is not &s;uch a difference as you are made &s;en&s;ible of by comparing and clo&s;e examination, but it is &s;uch as &s;trikes you immediately, and which you can't avoid perceiving.</P>
<P>THE language of the two people is not more unlike than their features, complexions, manners, dre&s;s, and diet. Their carriages, their cattle, their habitations&mdash;nay, their very fields are different. Many things are flim&s;y in FRANCE, mo&s;t things are &s;olid in ENGLAND. Vanity predominates in the former, and in the latter pride.
<PB N="243" REF="264">A FRENCHMAN di&s;plays his con&s;e|quence, an ENGLISHMAN conceals it. The human face, which in general is brown with us, &s;eems to have been wa&s;hed fair in ALBION. Our Ladies have taught tho&s;e of ENGLAND how to conver&s;e, and in return may learn from them in many points female delicacy and decorum. Without half the vivacity of FRENCH Women, the ENGLISH have a deeper &s;en&s;ibility, and more purity in their thoughts and man|ners. Our cattle are &s;mall, lean, and feeble&mdash;theirs are large, fat, and vigo|rous. FRENCH vehicles are ill con|&s;tructed, heavy, and rumbling&mdash;tho&s;e of ENGLAND are compact, light, &s;trong, and excellently fini&s;hed. Im|po&s;ition is pretty common in both
<PB N="244" REF="265">countries; but an ENGLISHMAN pock|ets your money as if you was paying his demand, a FRENCHMAN as if you was conferring an obligation. They may beat us, or we may beat them, but the two nations will never a&s;&s;imilate.</P>
<P>As a ready-furni&s;hed hou&s;e, at the Court end of the town, was &s;ecured for the &s;elf-ennobled Pa&s;try-cook before his arrival, we had little more to do than to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The MARQUIS was &s;oon vi&s;ited by &s;everal of the fra|ternity, who brought with them &s;ome young ENGLISH Noblemen, and Gentlemen of rank and fa&s;hion, their pockets well lined with ca&s;h, and their brea&s;ts entirely free from &s;u&s;picion. His eyes gli&s;tened at the &s;ight of them,
<PB N="245" REF="266">I con&s;idered them as fowl ready for the market, and my Ma&s;ter with his a&s;&s;ociates as the fore&s;tallers.</P>
<P>MOST Game&s;ters, e&s;pecially FRENCH|MEN, are Beaus. The MARQUIS was one of the be&s;t dre&s;&s;ed men in London, and I was as well dre&s;&s;ed as my Ma&s;ter. With re&s;pect to cloaths, I was <HI>alter et idem</HI>; for whatever he took off on one day, I wore on the next. If you wi&s;h|ed to know how the MARQUIS was dre&s;&s;ed on Monday, it was only to look at me on Tue&s;day; and it mu&s;t be acknowledged, I made a very re&s;pecta|ble appearance. I took care that my Ma&s;ter, the only per&s;on probably who would not have approved of my toilette,
<PB N="246" REF="267">&s;hould not &s;ee it, &s;o I avoided his un|&s;ea&s;onable critici&s;ms.</P>
<P>AFTER the de&s;cription I have given of my countenance, and of the &s;tern ferocity of my temper, the World, no doubt, will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of my being inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of the Ladies, and of my having made no &s;mall figure in the annals of Intrigue. I &s;peak not of the erratic Venus of <HI>St. Giles,</HI> the delight and &s;courge of the di&s;trict; nor of tho&s;e night-wander|ing Nymphs, tho&s;e yielding Dryads of the <HI>Park,</HI> who &s;hun the faithle&s;s light of lamps, and hide their charms under friendly &s;hades and in my&s;terious bowers&mdash;with &s;uch I &s;hould have had
<PB N="247" REF="268">few rivals; &s;uch adventures &s;hall not deba&s;e my records; but without more pre&s;ace I will acquaint my reader with the circum&s;tances which led me to unexpected honours in the field of gallantry.</P>
<P>I HAPPENED to be in London exactly at the time the celebrated DOCTOR GRAHAM opened his TEMPLE OF HEALTH in <HI>Pall-mall.</HI> This incom|prehen&s;ible Mountebank acquired a very re&s;pectable livelihood by giving edi&s;y|ing Lectures and admirable Experiments in the my&s;tical &s;cience of population. The Lectures of this worthy Profe&s;&s;or were well attended, but the Experi|ments much better. Ill-treated or neglected Wives went in crowds to
<PB N="248" REF="269">the DOCTOR, to get a remedy again&s;t &s;pleen and vapours. Sometimes it was a Lady of Quality, who had not yet the happine&s;s to bring her Right Honourable Bodkin of a Hu&s;band an heir to his e&s;tate and titles. Some|times it was the gentle timorous Hou&s;ekeeper of a brutal Citizen. As the felicity of her &s;en&s;ual Good-man con&s;i&s;ted either in gormandizing turtle, or in guzzling porter with a Club of Cuckolds like him&s;elf, and as, to clo&s;e the dome&s;tic &s;cene, he only &s;nored away the night by her fair &s;ide, his tender Helpmate was compelled by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;eek for &s;uch con&s;olation as the TEMPLE OF HEALTH could furni&s;h. Be&s;ides the&s;e already mentioned, came in a &s;hoal of unblu&s;hing MESSALINAS,
<PB N="249" REF="270">under no &s;uch fair pretence or colour as the titled Dame, or the yielding Shopkeeper from <HI>Threadneedle-&s;treet.</HI></P>
<P>ONE morning I happened to ca&s;t my eye over the DOCTOR's Pro&s;pectus, and having already experienced &s;ome mortifications in my progre&s;s as a pick|pocket, while my abilities to add to the number of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects remained untried, I re&s;olved to offer my &s;ervices at the TEMPLE.</P>
<P>BEING well dre&s;&s;ed, and a&s;&s;uring my&s;elf that the Herculean vigour of my mu&s;cles would get the better of the &s;ingular hideou&s;ne&s;s of my counte|nance, I &s;trolled with a di&s;engaged
<PB N="250" REF="271">air to the edifice erected to rationalized incontinence.</P>
<P>THOUGH I am per&s;uaded the DOC|TOR's learning did not go beyond <HI>Propria quae Maribus,</HI> he had deco|rated his door with a GREEK motto. While I was looking at this, and endeavouring to expound it, the porter perceived me, and opening the door, "That is Greek, my good friend," &s;ays he, <Q>you are knocking your head again&s;t there: I believe you will find it too hard for you.</Q> I was of the &s;ame opinion&mdash;&s;o &s;tepping forward, I told him at once my bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash; In&s;tead of an&s;wering me, the varlet laughed in my face, and was going to
<PB N="251" REF="272">&s;hut the door upon me; but I prevented it by &s;eizing him &s;toutly by the collar, and tumbling him down upon the pavement.</P>
<P>THE noi&s;e of this &s;cuffle brought the DOCTOR down &s;uddenly; who, hearing my explanation, admired my &s;trength, approved of my intentions, and engaged me in his &s;ervice. <Q>To be &s;ure,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>your counte|nance is not very attractive; but there is an air of Sons and Daughters in your appearance, which with a little good management, may &s;erve to procure you a decent livelihood.</Q></P>
<P>IT was agreed between us that I &s;hould return to the TEMPLE about
<PB N="252" REF="273">twilight, at which time he in&s;ormed me the my&s;teries began to be cele|brated. Before I left him, I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when, opening the door of a clo&s;et, he &s;hewed me a num|ber of beauti&s;ul ma&s;ques for males and females. The &s;ub&s;tance on which they were painted was of a tenuity lighter than the fine&s;t gauze, with apertures for the eyes, mouth, and no&s;trils. He &s;hewed me how to &s;a&s;ten one of them on, and when I looked in the gla&s;s, I became almo&s;t enamoured of my&s;elf, like another NARCISSUS.</P>
<P>"By this device," &s;ays he, <Q>be|&s;ides the advantage of concealment to per&s;ons of very nice &s;entiment
<PB N="253" REF="274">and delicacy, who frequent this place to make Experiments, you &s;ee we a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature. We conceal where &s;he has played the &s;tepmother, and all is di&s;played to the be&s;t advantage where &s;he has been bounti&s;ul.</Q></P>
<P>IN this place I can't avoid expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h that many Ladies wom I have &s;een, both in FRANCE and in ENGLAND, would adopt the DOCTOR's method of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Nature, in&s;tead of plai&s;tering them&s;elves as they now do with white lead and cinnabar. Be|&s;ides that the ma&s;que is no way preju|dicial to health, it is put on or taken off in a moment; it has no offen&s;ive odour; and it is no more an impo&s;ition than the other artificial cru&s;t which is
<PB N="254" REF="275">&s;o much in fa&s;hion. That Homeline&s;s &s;hould u&s;e &s;uch artifice is not extraor|dinary; but that Beauty, as we often &s;ee, &s;hould have recour&s;e to it, is indeed unaccountable.</P>
<P>WITH the DOCTOR'S ma&s;que and my own mu&s;cles, perhaps it is not nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure the Public that I a&s;&s;i&s;ted at an infinite number of Experi|ments. Two Gentlemen from the town of ATHLONE in IRELAND excepted, I may venture to &s;ay, without vanity, that I was the &s;avourite of the TEMPLE. How many families at both ends of the town may have been obliged to me for tho&s;e pretty little prattling cherubs always &s;o endearing to their &s;uppo&s;ed fathers, I can't pretend exactly
<PB N="255" REF="276">to determine; the number certainly mu&s;t be con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>At length, however, I began to grow di&s;gu&s;ted with variety, and at|tached my&s;elf principally to one vo|tary, who brought me devotion and money in abundance. One would have imagined that this kind Matron had taken upon her&s;elf alone the po|pulation of a whole pari&s;h, &s;o in&s;atia|ble was her appetite for Experiments. All the money &s;he could wheedle or &s;teal from her Cuckold came into my hands con&s;tantly. But great as were our re&s;ources, our expences were &s;till greater.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="277">AT la&s;t it became nece&s;&s;ary for me to look into the contents of the fa|vourite little Pa&s;ty of the un&s;u&s;pecting MARQUIS. I was plea&s;ed to find in it what &s;u&s;ficiently ju&s;tified the Owner's partiality. I made a divi&s;ion with him. To my&s;elf I appropriated, what might be called the mo&s;t &s;avoury part, about four hundred guineas in rouleaus; all the notes, to a very con&s;iderable amount, upon different Bankers in London; two pair of loaded dice; and all the rings with real diamonds, with all the other jewels. I did not even touch &s;everal packs of cards properly made up for his purpo&s;e, further than ju&s;t to look if there was any thing va|luable under them; I left him all the
<PB N="257" REF="278">rings and jewels with fal&s;e &s;tones, many in number and &s;ome very pretty, and eight pair of loaded dice&mdash;&s;o that I did not deprive him of the means to recruit his fortune at lea&s;t as honoura|bly as he had acquired it.</P>
<P>BIDDING then an eternal adieu to both my Ma&s;ters, the Pa&s;try-cook and the Mountebank; to PALL-MALL, the TEMPLE, and the MATRONS&mdash;and &s;taying only to change my notes with the different Bankers, I popped my&s;elf into a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and found my&s;elf next day re&s;tored to my dear native country.</P>
