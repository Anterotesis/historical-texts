<L>No bribes I bring, to influence your voice,</L>
<L>Our Candidate aims at, being Freedom's choice;</L>
<L>If un&s;ucce&s;sful, he a&s;&s;ures this borough,</L>
<L>He'll call no critic &s;crutiny to-morrow;</L>
<L>The public judgment, he abides with awe,</L>
<L>And owns your right to give the drama law.</L>
<L>Sir Li&s;tle&s;s Lounge, with well-bred yawn, declares,</L>
<L>He dreads encount'ring your election bears;</L>
<L>What with the toil of canva&s;&s;ing, he vows,</L>
<L>And making &s;peeches when one's in the hou&s;e,</L>
<L>So much of rights, and liberties they rave,</L>
<L>In the&s;e free &s;tates a man's a downright &s;lave!</L>

<L>Thus touch the &s;urface of pure Freedom's &s;pring.</L>
<L>To treat of liberty, in our weak lays,</L>
<L>Is placing &s;oil beneath the diamond's blaze.</L>
<L>Oh, may our arms to that bright gem re&s;tore</L>
<L>The &s;plendor which it boa&s;ted long before!</L>
<L>Nor need we long de&s;pair to &s;ee that day,</L>
<L>When vengeance &s;hall foul treachery betray,</L>
<L>Since Cornwallis commands, and Tarlton leads the fray.</L>
<L>Then peace once more &s;hall rear her angel head,</L>
<L>Bright as the Phoenix, from her burning bed.</L>

<P>I confe&s;s, father, &s;ome parliment-men of late have proved they can do any thing. But &s;urely, you can never think my booby cou&s;in will cut any figure in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>

<P>And to compleat the ridicule, his mother canva&s;&s;es for him. Sure the &s;pirit of ab&s;urdity has de|&s;cended upon our family, and determined we &s;hould be a public laughing-&s;tock. She would have me with her ye&s;terday; and &s;uch a tramp as we had! She took me through all the filthy alleys in town; then we were obliged to ki&s;s the children in every hou&s;e we went into, be they never &s;o dirty, and keep a pocket full of halfpence to &s;lip into her hands; a proof, dear father, of what a bribe can do, when we can purcha&s;e nothing but a rattle with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this was mere pa&s;time to what I have gone through on my canva&s;s. I went ye&s;terday to &s;o|licit the vote and intere&s;t of old Smoke Jack, the chimney-&s;weeper, and found his whole family &s;eated at a banquet of ox-cheek and bacon. I was pre&s;&s;ed to eat you may be &s;ure; &s;o down I &s;at between his two elde&s;t boys, as he called them, &s;o black! that they looked more like two organized bags of &s;oot than hu|man beings. I &s;at clear for &s;ome time, 'till one of the lads reaching his brother the bread acro&s;s me, black'd all the &s;ide of my coat, which, as ill-luck would have it, happened to be cream-coloured. His father, mad at his ill manners, got up to &s;trike him; when the boy, in &s;triving to e&s;cape, threw me and his brother down, and before I got up I was black enough to pa&s;s for one of the family.</P>
</SP>

<P>And wasn't this &s;ufficient to give you a &s;ur|feit of canva&s;&s;ing?</P>

<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, &s;ir, how happy were we before you took this notion in your head! I then had hopes my dear Belfield would be mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he takes pains to provoke me; he has &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to George; has open'd a hou&s;e, writes ballads, gets drunk, and is ri&s;ing every day into con&s;equence.</P>
</SP>

<P>O, heavens! if he &s;hould be return'd, per|haps then, &s;ir, you would relent.</P>
</SP>

<P>Zounds, don't make me mad! he &s;han't be returned: George &s;hall carry you and his election together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He may be returned for the borough of Bribewell, but Belfield has an intere&s;t in my heart, which no venal candidate can rob him of.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grumble as much as you plea&s;e, ma'am, but I am determined your marriage articles, and the writs for the new parliment, &s;hall be returnable toge|ther. I fancy there are &s;ew who can &s;ay as much for them&s;elves as Joe Parmazan. I was bred a chee&s;e|monger, 'tis true, but what of that? when I have a &s;on in the hou&s;e, his cloquence will pare off the rind of my ob&s;curity. I hope, like his father, be'll have all the blue mold of patrioti&s;m about him. Let me &s;ee, how &s;tand my morning expences, (<HI>Pulls the dif|ferent articles out of his pocket as be names them</HI>) I have above three hundred pounds worth of goods in my pockets, that at a ju&s;t apprai&s;ement would not be va|lued at twenty &s;hillings; but election wares are tickli&s;h articles, and whil&s;t the fair la&s;ts, keen chapmen will
<PB N="4" REF="7">have their prices. Here's a piece of gingerbread that co&s;t me five guineas, that I could have bought for a penny at any baker's in London, but no price is thought too high for real parliment cakes. A child's trumpet too! a pretty play-thing this for a man of my age! It co&s;t me two guineas, and I mu&s;t wait 'till my grand&s;on is born to blow me a tune upon it. Here's fifty pounds &s;lap in a ca&s;e of razors. The&s;e razors may &s;have keen, but I think they never will cut &s;o clo&s;e as the fellow who &s;old them. Here's a toothpick-ca&s;e, co&s;t me twenty pounds. If a man was to pay every day in the &s;ame proportion for his dinner, he might &s;oon &s;hut up his mouth, and give his teeth a holiday! But oh, mon&s;trous! in this paper I have a hundred hob-nails, for which I paid a hun|dred pounds down upon the nail; I was nail'd hard in that bargain. Here is &s;ome Scotch &s;nuff, and &s;ome court &s;ticking-plai&s;ter, which co&s;t me very dear; but I don't mind that, as they are articles which will be of great u&s;e to the Member when he gets into the hou&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'm turned out of both hou&s;es, the parliment hou&s;e and my uncle's hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Belfield, I wi&s;h you joy of your election. Nay, believe me, I am &s;incere; your excellent talents have made a convert of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you overwhelm me with &s;urprize and plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll dine with you to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll be the chief gue&s;t, dear &s;ir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you &s;hall dine with me to-morrow, and by the union of your and Letitia's intere&s;t, have a &s;on that de&s;erves to &s;it in parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. High.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, is my &s;on in&s;ulted, &s;lighted, and ca&s;t off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, am I to be for&s;aken?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. High.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my young Roman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am no young Roman&mdash;I am an old En|gli&s;hman &mdash;&s;o come along, mother, for my friend Goo&s;e has got another borough cut out for me.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exeunt</HI> George <HI>and</HI> Mrs. Highflight.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder what the devil bewitched me as to &s;uppo&s;e that great calf, my nephew, could ever cut a &s;igure as a public &s;peaker. But, Belfield, give me your hand, which here I join with Letitia's, and
<PB N="35" REF="38">thus make atonement for my folly&mdash;my crime I &s;hould rather &s;ay, for to attempt impo&s;ing on the peo|ple an incapable repre&s;entative, is high trea&s;on again&s;t the con&s;titution.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Goo&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>The &s;uit is &s;poilt for all our wit;</HI></L>

<L><HI>If one borough will not fit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>We'll take his mea&s;ure for another.</HI></L>
