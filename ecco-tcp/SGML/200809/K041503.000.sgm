<HEAD>THE PLUM-CAKES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A FARMER who &s;ome wealth po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>With three fine boys was al&s;o ble&s;t;</L>
<L>The lads were healthy, &s;tout, and young,</L>
<L>And neither wanted &s;en&s;e nor tongue.</L>
<L>Tom, Will, and Jack, like other boys,</L>
<L>Lov'd tops and marbles, &s;port and toys.</L>
<L>The father &s;couted that fal&s;e plan,</L>
<L>That money only makes the man,</L>
<L>But, to the be&s;t of his di&s;cerning,</L>
<L>Was bent on giving them good learning:</L>
<L>He was a man of ob&s;ervation,</L>
<L>No &s;cholar, yet had penetration;</L>
<L>So with due care, a &s;chool he &s;ought,</L>
<L>Where his young &s;ons might well be taught.</L>
<L>Quoth he, "I know not which rehear&s;es</L>
<L>"Mo&s;t properly his themes or ver&s;es,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">
"Yet I can do a father's part,</L>
<L>"And &s;chool the temper, mind, and heart;</L>
<L>"The natural bent of each I'll know,</L>
<L>"And trifles be&s;t that bent may &s;how."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas ju&s;t before the clo&s;ing year,</L>
<L>When Chri&s;tmas holidays were near,</L>
<L>The farmer call'd to &s;ee his boys,</L>
<L>And a&s;k'd how each his time employs.</L>
<L>Quoth Will, "there's father, boys without,</L>
<L>"He's brought us &s;omething good no doubt."</L>
<L>The father &s;ees their merry faces,</L>
<L>With joy beholds them, and embraces.</L>
<L>"Come boys, of home you'll have your fill,"</L>
<L>"Yes, Chri&s;tmas now is near," &s;ays Will,</L>
<L>"'Tis ju&s;t twelve days&mdash;the&s;e notches &s;ee,</L>
<L>"My notches with the days agree.</L>
<L>"Well," &s;aid the &s;ire, "again I'll come,</L>
<L>"And gladly fetch my brave boys home.</L>
<L>"You two the dappled mare &s;hall ride,</L>
<L>"Jack mount the poney by his &s;ide;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">
"Mean time, my lads, I've brought you here,</L>
<L>"No &s;mall provi&s;ion of good cheer."</L>
<L>Then from his pockets &s;trait he takes,</L>
<L>A va&s;t profu&s;ion of plum-cakes;</L>
<L>He counts them out, a plenteous &s;tore,</L>
<L>No boy &s;hall have or le&s;s or more;</L>
<L>Twelve cakes he gives to each dear &s;on,</L>
<L>When each expected only one;</L>
<L>And then, with many a kind expre&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>He leaves them to their own di&s;cretion,</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to mark the u&s;e each made</L>
<L>Of what he to their hands convey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The twelve days pa&s;t he comes once more,</L>
<L>And brings the hor&s;es to the door;</L>
<L>The boys with rapture &s;ee appear,</L>
<L>The poney and the dappled mare;</L>
<L>Each moment now an hour they count,</L>
<L>And &s;la&s;h their whips and long to mount.</L>
<L>As with the boys his ride he takes,</L>
<L>He a&s;ks the hi&s;tory of the cakes.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="5" REF="5">
<L>Says Will, "dear father, life is &s;hort,</L>
<L>"So I re&s;olved to make quick &s;port;</L>
<L>"The cakes were all &s;o nice and &s;weet,</L>
<L>"I thought I'd have one jolly treat,</L>
<L>"Why &s;hould I balk, &s;aid I, my ta&s;te?</L>
<L>"I'll make at once a hearty fea&s;t.</L>
<L>"So, &s;nugly by my&s;elf I fed,</L>
<L>"When every boy was gone to-bed;</L>
<L>"I gorg' them all, both pa&s;te and plum,</L>
<L>"And did not wa&s;te a &s;ingle crumb;</L>
<L>"Indeed they made me, to my &s;orrow,</L>
<L>"As &s;ick as death upon the morrow;</L>
<L>"This made me mourn my rich repa&s;t,</L>
<L>"And wi&s;h I had not fed &s;o fa&s;t."</L>
<L>Quoth Jack, "I was not &s;uch a dunce,</L>
<L>"To eat my quantum up at once;</L>
<L>"And tho' the boys all long'd to clutch 'em,</L>
<L>"I would not let a creature touch 'em;</L>
<L>"Nor tho' the whole were in my power,</L>
<L>"Would I my&s;elf one cake devour;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6">
"Thanks to the u&s;e of keys and locks,</L>
<L>"They're all now &s;nug within my box:</L>
<L>"The mi&s;chief is, by hoarding long,</L>
<L>"They're grown &s;o mouldy and &s;o &s;trong,</L>
<L>"I find they won't be fit to eat,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Well Tom," the anxious parent cries,</L>
<L>"How did you manage?" Tom replies,</L>
<L>"I &s;hun'd each wide extreme to take,</L>
<L>"To glut my maw, or hoard my cake;</L>
<L>"I thought each day its wants wou'd have,</L>
<L>"And appetite again might crave;</L>
<L>"Twelve &s;chool-days &s;till my notches counted,</L>
<L>"To twelve my father's cakes amounted;</L>
<L>"So every day I took out one,</L>
<L>"But never ate my cake alone;</L>
<L>"With every needy boy I &s;har'd,</L>
<L>"And more than half I always &s;par'd.</L>
<L>"One ev'ry day 'twixt &s;elf and friend,</L>
<L>"Has brought my dozen to an end;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7">
"My la&s;t remaining cake to-day,</L>
<L>"I wou'd not touch but gave away;</L>
<L>"A boy was &s;ick, and &s;carce cou'd eat,</L>
<L>"To him it prov'd a welcome treat;</L>
<L>"Jack called me &s;pendthrift, not to &s;ave,</L>
<L>"Will dubb'd me fool becau&s;e I gave;</L>
<L>"But when our la&s;t day came I &s;mil'd,</L>
<L>"For Will's were gone, and Jack's were &s;poil'd;</L>
<L>"Not hoarding much nor eating fa&s;t,</L>
<L>"I &s;erv'd a needy friend at la&s;t."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The&s;e tales the father's thoughts employ;</L>
<L>"By the&s;e," &s;aid he, "I know each boy:</L>
<L>"Yet Jack, who hoarded what he had,</L>
<L>"The world will call a frugal lad;</L>
<L>"And &s;elfi&s;h gormandi&s;ing Will,</L>

<L>So when our day of life is pa&s;t,</L>
