<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Plot of this Comedy, as far as regards Rivers's vi&s;its to Modi&s;h and Mrs. Ormond, was taken from the Novel of Sidney Biddulph; Mr. Sheridan had already borrowed the &s;ame incident from the &s;ame &s;ource, and employed it (though in a different manner) in the "School for Scandal."</P>
<P>The "Ea&s;t Indian" was admirably well acted from beginning to end, particularly the part of Rivers by Mr. Kemble: nothing was overchar|ged, nothing under-acted. Indeed, to call his per|formance <HI>acting,</HI> is doing it inju&s;tice: It was nature throughout.</P>
<P>This Comedy was written before I was &s;ixteen. It was performed la&s;t &s;ea&s;on for the benefits of Mrs. Jordan and Mrs. Powell, and, in con&s;equence of the approbation with which it was received, was brought forward again in la&s;t December. It was again received with applau&s;e, for which I thank the Public: the &s;ucceeding repre&s;entations did not prove attractive, for which I here make my ac|knowledgments to Mr. Sheridan, who blocked up
<PB N="4" REF="3">
my road, mounted on his great tragic war-hor&s;e Pizarro, and trampled my humble pad-nag of a Comedy under foot without the lea&s;t compunction. My Readers mu&s;t decide, whether my Play merit|ed &s;o tran&s;ient an exi&s;tence; it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that <HI>I</HI> am quite of the contrary opinion.</P>

<L>IN life's gay &s;pring, while yet the carele&s;s hours</L>
<L>Dance light on blooming beds of early flowers,</L>
<L>Ere knowledge of the world has taught the mind</L>
<L>To &s;orrow for it&s;elf and &s;hun mankind,</L>
<L>In &s;weet vain dreams &s;till Fancy bids the boy</L>
<L>Doat on fair pro&s;pects of ideal joy:</L>
<L>Life's choice&s;t fruits then court his eager hand;</L>
<L>Each eye is gentle, and each voice is bland;</L>
<L>Fal&s;e friend&s;hip prompts no &s;igh, and draws no tear,</L>
<L>And love &s;eems &s;carce more beauteous, than &s;incere!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ere &s;ixteen years had wing'd their wanton flight,</L>
<L>While yet his head was young, and heart was light,</L>
<L>Our author plann'd the&s;e &s;cenes; and while he drew,</L>
<L>How bright each colour &s;eem'd, each line how true.</L>
<L>Gods! with what rapture every &s;peech he &s;poke!</L>
<L>Gods! how he chuckled as he penn'd each joke!</L>
<L>And when at length his ravi&s;h'd eyes &s;urvey</L>
<L>That wondrous work complete&mdash;a Five Act Play,</L>
<L>His youthful heart how &s;elf applau&s;es &s;well!</L>
<L>&mdash;"It isn't perfect, but its va&s;tly well!"&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since then, with many a pang, our Bard has bought</L>
<L>More ju&s;t deci&s;ion, and le&s;s partial thought:</L>
<L>Kind vanity no longer blinds his &s;ight,</L>
<L>His fillet falls, and lets in odious light.</L>
<L>Time bids the darling work its leaves expand,</L>
<L>Each flower Parna&s;&s;ian withers in his hand;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">Stern judgement every latent fault detects,</L>
<L>And all its fancied beauties prove defects.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, for &s;he thinks &s;ome &s;cenes po&s;&s;e&s;s an art</L>
<L>To plea&s;e the fancy, and to melt the heart,</L>
<L>Thalia bids his play to-night appear,</L>
<L>Thalia call'd in heaven, but Jordan here<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Comedy was fir&s;t performed for the Benefit of Mrs. Jordan.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>So frail his hope, &s;o weak he thinks his cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Our author &s;ays he dares not a&s;k applau&s;e;</L>
<L>He only begs, that with indulgence new,</L>
<L>You'll hear him patiently, and hear him through:</L>
<L>Then, if his piece proves worthle&s;s, never &s;ham it;</L>
<L>But damn it, gentle friends&mdash;Oh! damn it! damn it!</L>

<P>My dear Ned!</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Wal&s;ingham!&mdash;This plea&s;ure is quite unexpected; but where have you been con|cealed the&s;e hundred years? I was afraid, that Cynthia wearied of her Endymion had pitched upon <HI>you</HI> for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and believed you at this mo|ment an inhabitant of the moon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my young friend; the godde&s;s has too much ta&s;te to &s;elect &s;uch an old weather-beaten fellow for a Ceci&s;beo. But if you &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k, what I've been doing for the&s;e la&s;t three years, you mu&s;t know, I've been fool-hunting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fool-hunting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Being of an adu&s;t cynical con&s;ti|tution, infinite laughter is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for my health: for this purpo&s;e my phy&s;ician pre|&s;cribed me a cour&s;e of fools, and truly I've reaped great benefit from his advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then leave Great Britain? Hea|ven knows, a &s;carcity of fools is not one of our wants!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but the growth of Engli&s;h ab|&s;urdity for the year 95 not being to my ta&s;te, I de|termined to change my fools, as other invalids change the air; but after all I mu&s;t give the pre|ference to the folly of my own country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your own country is very much ob|liged to you; but &s;ince this is your ta&s;te, I've a &s;uperb fea&s;t for you in Lord Li&s;tle&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, your uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; to my &s;orrow he &s;leeps with his fore-fathers, while my noble cou&s;in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his title and e&s;tate, and, what is wor&s;t, has me entirely in his power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a tedious &s;tory; but the &s;hort of it is, that when I married, my generous uncle di&s;|charged my debts to the tune of 3OOOl.: un|luckily he neglected to de&s;troy my acknowledg|ment, which falling into his &s;on's hands, the pre|&s;ent Earl wi&s;ely keeps it, and calls him&s;elf my &s;ole creditor. Di&s;charge it for &s;ome time I can|not;
<PB N="3" REF="9">
but, however, unle&s;s we di&s;agree, he will not pre&s;s me for immediate payment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, and even if he &s;hould, we'll find means to &s;atisfy him; and &s;o away with that gloomy face, dear Ned! As &s;oon as I &s;aw you, I gue&s;&s;ed that &s;omething was wrong; but I'm glad, 'twas nothing more than a pecuniary difficulty.</P>

<P>Hear me then, and judge for your&s;elf&mdash;You knew well the character of the woman, to who&s;e fate, while I was &s;till a &s;tripling, accident not affection united mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and a mi&s;erable life &s;he led you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jealous without love, profu&s;e without genero&s;ity, negligent in her dre&s;s, violent in her temper, coar&s;e in her manners, with no virtue but that one which &s;he owed to con&s;titution, not to principle, during three years &s;he rendered my home an hell. My patience was at length ex|hau&s;ted; I made over to her the remnants of an e&s;tate which her extravagance had ruined, bade this dome&s;tic fiend an eternal farewell, and &s;ailed, under the a&s;&s;umed name of Dorimant, to India.</P>
</SP>

</SP>

Her remon&s;trances have carried with them conviction, and I am re&s;olved to wait on her this morning to entreat her protection for Zorayda; and, &s;hould &s;he grant it, to engage, cruel as it will be to the feelings of us both, no more to vi&s;it my love, till I can offer her my hand and fortune.</P>

<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very good re&s;olution too: I long to &s;ee your godde&s;s.</P>

<P>Come then to Lady Clara's, and behold the fictitious charms of modi&s;h beauty effaced by the native graces, the enchanting &s;implicity of my artle&s;s, my bewitching Zorayda!

<P>Every table in town may be &s;upplied with that article at a very &s;mall expence, I doubt not; for, after all my peregrinations in que&s;t of folly, I am decided, that no country abounds more with that luxury than little, England; where ab|&s;urdities &s;pring as kindly as mu&s;hrooms upon dunghills, and you can't turn a corner without &s;tarting a fool!
