<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE Fir&s;t Edition of this Work was &s;o ill Printed, and by Rea&s;on of the Author's Ab&s;ence from the Pre&s;s was &s;o uncorrect, that it &s;tood more than ordinarily in Need of the Help of a good Intro|duction; yet it is hoped the Work has not di&s;|honour'd the Reverend Per&s;on, who did it the Fa|vour to give it the fir&s;t Recommendation.</P>
<P>The &V;&s;efulne&s;s of the Subject, and the Honesty of the De&s;ign, has prevailed to give it a good Re|ception in the World: And notwith&s;tanding the Ca&s;ual Imperfections of the Fir&s;t Part, &s;ome good Men have been plea&s;ed to accept the Performance, to u&s;her it into the World much to its Advantage, and to recommend it as well from the Pulpit as from the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The &V;nworthy Author earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd, and to his utmo&s;t endeavour'd to be for ever conceal'd; not that he was a&s;ham'd of the Work, or &s;ees any Rea&s;on yet to be &s;o; profe&s;&s;ing to have a firm Belief, that he was not without a more than or|dinary Pre&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Divine Spirit in the Performance. But being fully &s;atis|fied with the Pro&s;pect of doing Good by it: He de&s;ir'd his <HI>Prai&s;e might not be of Men, but of God.</HI></P>
<P>To this End he took &s;uch Mea&s;ures at fir&s;t for effectually pre&s;erving the Secret, and for his entire remaining in the Ob&s;curity he de&s;ir'd, that for &s;ome time after the Publication he continued ungue&s;s'd at, and he flatter'd him&s;elf for a while, that the Author would be no farther enquired into: <HI>But Satan hindred.</HI></P>
<P>The Succe&s;s of the Work, and the many Te&s;ti|monies given to the good Effect it has had in Families, notwith&s;tanding their Knowledge of the Author, has fully deliver'd him from the Di&s;|couragement he was under on that Occa&s;ion; and this alone has prevail'd with him for a Second Edition, which he had for &s;ometime re&s;olv'd again&s;t; it was not without Rea&s;on that he had great Appre|hen&s;ions, lea&s;t &s;ome Men &s;uffering their Prejudices to prevail even over their Zeal for publick Good, might be tempted to lay the Imperfections of the Author of this Book, as a &s;tumbling Block in the way of tho&s;e who might otherwi&s;e receive Benefit by it, and &s;o the good Effect of his Labour might be in Part ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
But God, who as before, he firmly believes di|rected his Hand in the Work, has given his vi|&s;ible Ble&s;&s;ing to it; and has thereby from Hea|ven own'd the Author to his inexpre&s;&s;ible Satis|faction and Joy. <HI>To his Name be all the Prai&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>AFTER THIS, Let who will reject him or his Book, it is not po&s;&s;ible to give him the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>AFTER THIS, if any Man will rob him|&s;elf, or any one el&s;e, of the Good this Work might otherwi&s;e do, <HI>at his Door be the Sin.</HI></P>
<P>The Pre&s;ent Edition is more carefully corrected, and the Errors of the Pre&s;s are &s;o few, and of &s;o &s;mall Con&s;equence, that an ordinary Judgment will correct them in the reading.</P>
<P>The Author in revi&s;ing it has made no Ad|ditions, thinking his fir&s;t De&s;ign fully exhau&s;ted, and al&s;o e&s;teeming it injurious to tho&s;e, who have bought the fir&s;t, to make a Second Edition vary &s;o much from it, as to make them think their Money lo&s;t, and to oblige them to buy it over again.</P>
<P>Some few Things are omitted indeed, but not con&s;iderable, and tho&s;e principally in the <HI>Notes;</HI> from the meer Sen&s;e the Author had of the Com|ment's being le&s;s beautiful than the Text; and that others are able to make better Annotations than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The whole Work being de&s;ign'd both to divert and in&s;truct, the Author has endeavoured to adapt it as much as po&s;&s;ible to both tho&s;e &V;&s;es, from whence &s;ome have call'd it <HI>a Religious Play.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">
It would more have an&s;wer'd that Title, had the Author's fir&s;t De&s;ign been pur&s;ued, which was to have made it a Drammatick Poem: But the Subject was too &s;olemn, and the Text too copious, to &s;uffer the Re&s;traint on one Hand, or the Excur&s;ions on the other, which the Decora|tion of a Poem would have made nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As to its being called <HI>a Play, be it called &s;o if they plea&s;e;</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, &s;ome Parts of it are too much acted in many Families a|mong us: The Author wi&s;hes that either all <HI>our Plays</HI> were as u&s;eful for the Improvement and Entertainment of the World, or that <HI>they were</HI> le&s;s encouraged.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Rea&s;ons which obliged the Author to conceal his Name at the fir&s;t Publication, prevails with him to forbear it now; &s;o that tho' he neither declines owning the Work, or being known by his Name, yet referring it to Provi|dence, he leaves the Di&s;covery to go no farther than others think fit to carry it.</P>

<HEAD>The Introduction to the Fir&s;t PART.</HEAD>
<P>_CAtechi&s;ing of Children, and in&s;truct|ing them in the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, has been a Pra|ctice in the Church as Ancient as Religion it &s;elf; and be&s;ides the Nature of the Thing which re|quires it, was deduc'd from that &s;trict Injunction laid upon the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Deut. 6. 7. <HI>And thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy Children,</HI> &s;peaking of the Laws and Statutes which God then commanded <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> And again, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 9. <HI>But teach them to thy Sons, and thy Sons Sons.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">
It is not the De&s;ign of this Undertaking to give a Li&s;t of Authorities in Scripture for Catechi&s;ing and In&s;tructing of Children, or the Commendations and Te&s;timonies given there to tho&s;e that did in|&s;truct their Children in the Knowledge and Practice of Religion: That eminent Text is &s;ufficient to this, being the ble&s;&s;ed Character given to <HI>Abraham</HI> from God him&s;elf, <HI>I know</HI> Abraham, &s;ays the Lord, <HI>Gen.</HI> 18 19. <HI>that he will Command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But we live in an Age that does not want &s;o much to know their Duty <HI>as to practi&s;e it;</HI> not &s;o much <HI>to be taught,</HI> as to be made obedient to what they have <HI>already learnt;</HI> and therefore I &s;hall take up no Time in proving this Matter to be a Duty, there's hardly a Wretch &s;o hardned but will readily ac|knowledge it.</P>
<P>But we are, I &s;ay, arrived at a Time in which Men will frankly own a thing to be their Duty which <HI>at the &s;ame time</HI> they dare omit the Practice of; and innumerable Arts, Shifts and Turns they find out to make that omi&s;&s;ion ea&s;ie to them&s;elves, and excu&s;able to others.</P>
<P>One Part of this Work is pointed <HI>at &s;uch;</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, to make them blu&s;h at their unacountable Ra&s;hne&s;s, and to &s;hame them out of &s;uch a fordid incon&s;i&s;tent Cour&s;e as that of living in the allow'd Omi&s;&s;ion of what they acknowledge to be their Duty.</P>
<P>The way I have taken for this, is <HI>entirely New,</HI> and at fir&s;t <HI>perhaps</HI> it may appear &s;omething <HI>Odd,</HI> and the Method may be contemned; But let &s;uch blame their own more irregular Tempers, that mu&s;t have every thing turned into new Models; mu&s;t be touch'd with <HI>Novelty,</HI> and have their Fancies humour'd <HI>with the Dre&s;s</HI> of a thing; &s;o that if it be what has been &s;aid over and over a thou&s;and
<PB N="3" REF="8">
times, yet if it has but a different colour'd Coat, or a new Feather in its Cap, it plea&s;es and wins upon them, whereas the &s;ame Truths written in the divine&s;t Stile in the World, would be flat, &s;tale and unplea&s;ant without it.</P>
<P>If then, after all the pains which have been taken by mini&s;terial Labour and In&s;truction, and by the pre&s;&s;ing Exhortations and moving Arguments of eminent Divines, even of all Opinions, in their Wri|tings on this Subject, this mean and familiar Me|thod &s;hould by its Novelty prevail, this will be a happy Undertaking, but no Reproach at all to the Labours of others.</P>
<P>In the pur&s;uit of this Book care is taken to a|void Di&s;tinctions of Opinion, as to Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> or <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> and no Offence can be taken here either on the one Side or the other; as I hope <HI>both</HI> are Chri&s;tians, &s;o <HI>both</HI> are treated here as &s;uch, and the Advice is impartially directed <HI>to both</HI> with|out the lea&s;t Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians and Pro|te&s;tants, will not in&s;truct their Children and Ser|vants, here they will find their Children and Ser|vants in&s;tructing them; and reproving them too; and both they and their Children may here meet with In&s;tructions together.</P>
<P>The Father repre&s;ented here, appears knowing enough, but &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing Chri|&s;tians who acknowledging God in their Mouths, <HI>yet take no effectual Care</HI> to honour him with their Practice; that live in a Round of Religion, as a thing of cour&s;e; have not the Power of Godline&s;s, nor much of the Form; a kind of a Negative Chri|&s;tian, <HI>a God-I-thank thee Phari&s;ee,</HI> found in know|ledge, but negligent in Conver&s;ation; Orthodox in Opinion, but Hetrodox in Practice; and that I have found out &s;uch a Per&s;on, is to &s;ignify, that let
<PB N="4" REF="9">
him be <HI>where</HI> he will, and <HI>who</HI> he will, this Work is calculated to reprove and admoni&s;h him.</P>
<P>The Mother here repre&s;ented, is likewi&s;e a for|mal loo&s;e-living Chri&s;tian, a Prote&s;tant Profe&s;&s;or of Religion without the Practice of it; <HI>but yet</HI> &s;he is a <HI>Profe&s;&s;or,</HI> one that knows how to talk of Religion, and makes a &s;how to belong to it, but&mdash;alas for the re&s;t! the Con&s;equence will appear in the Book; in which I doubt a great many may &s;ee their own Pi|cture drawn: May the Sight of it have the &s;ame healing, convincing Efficacy, as appears upon the Per&s;ons here, who&s;e Story is therefore brought for an Example to them.</P>
<P>May they &s;ee it <HI>and blu&s;h; like the Father here mention'd:</HI> Like him may they <HI>be a&s;ham'd of their Likene&s;s:</HI> May they &s;ee it, <HI>and</HI> like him <HI>effectually reform the dreadful Practi&s;e:</HI> This would com|pleatly an&s;wer the End and De&s;ign of the Author of this Book, and rejoice the Hearts of all &s;erious Chri&s;tians in the Nation.</P>
<P>The Child who is here made the Inquirer. has <HI>no Que&s;tions</HI> put into its Mouth but what are Natu|ral, and Rational; con&s;i&s;tent with Principle, and as near as could be are &s;uch as are proper even to a Child; none but what the Author wi&s;hes every body would put &s;eriou&s;ly to them&s;elves as often as they look about them in the World, and none but what even a Child is capable to enquire into. The Author has endeavour'd to produce the Que&s;tions with <HI>an Air of meer Nature,</HI> Innocence and Child|hood; <HI>yet &s;uch</HI> as being naturally adapted to the general State of things may be appo&s;it and direct: <HI>Such as</HI> being the meer product of the mo&s;t common Rea&s;onings, and even of the Under&s;tanding of Chil|dren, a Child's Under&s;tanding may ju&s;tly be &s;up|po&s;ed to have propo&s;ed them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10">
Tho' much of the Story is Hi&s;torical, and might be made appear to be true in Fact, yet the Author re&s;olving not to give the lea&s;t hint that &s;hould lead to Per&s;ons, has been obliged to leave it Uncertain to the Reader, whether it be a Hi&s;tory or a Para|ble; believing it may be either way adapted to the &s;incere De&s;ign: Which is (1.) to reprove tho&s;e Parents who neglect the In&s;truction of their Chil|dren; And (2.) to direct young Per&s;ons in their fir&s;t Reflections, guiding them to enquire about them&s;elves, their <HI>Original,</HI> their <HI>State,</HI> their <HI>Pro|gre&s;s</HI> in this World, the rea&s;on of their <HI>being born into it,</HI> their pa&s;&s;ing <HI>out of it,</HI> and <HI>which is the main Cogitation,</HI> their Condition <HI>beyond it.</HI></P>
<P>The Method <HI>is New,</HI> as is &s;aid above, but per|haps may be more plea&s;ing: Any Thing, or any Method, if we may but bring the main End to pa&s;, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to bring Young and Old to &s;et earne&s;tly and heartily about the great Work of &s;erving, glorify|ing, and obeying the God that made them.</P>
<P>The Child is &s;uppo&s;ed to be come up to &s;uch Years as to be thinking and inquiring, &s;uppo&s;e about five or &s;ix Years old; and as Nature is always prompting the Soul to be &s;earching after &s;omething, which it did not know before, &s;o that Inqui&s;itive Temper is <HI>in &s;ome</HI> &s;edater than in others; however, our little Child asks but very little of his Father, but what a Child <HI>at that Age</HI> may be very capable of asking.</P>
<P>The Scene of this little Action is not laid very remote, or the Circum&s;tance ob&s;cure; the Father walking in a Field behind his Garden, finds one of his Children wandred out, all alone, under a Row or Walk of Trees, &s;itting upon a little ri&s;ing Ground, by it &s;elf, looking about, and mighty bu|&s;ie, pointing this way, and that way; &s;ometimes <HI>up,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>down,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>to its &s;elf;</HI> &s;o that the Father coming unperceived pretty near,
<PB N="6" REF="11">
found the little Creature very bu&s;ie <HI>about &s;omething</HI> he could not tell what; when the Father, after much Ob&s;ervation, and &s;ome Surpri&s;e, di&s;cover+ing him&s;elf, asks the Child <HI>What he was doing,</HI> and &s;o &s;its down by him, which Que&s;tion begins the FIRST DIALOGUE.</P>

<P>No, <HI>my dear,</HI> but we know it two ways, (1.)

<SP>

<P>Why Child, you are to under&s;tand, that when the fir&s;t Man and Woman in the World was created, God having made a Covenant or Agree|ment of Holine&s;s and Life <HI>with them,</HI> and <HI>in them with all that &s;hould be born of them,</HI> they broke that Covenant, and &s;o involved all their Po&s;terity in their Guilt, the Puni&s;hment of which was Eter|nal Death: But God, who, <HI>as I told you child,</HI> was Infinitely Good, <HI>tho' provok'd utterly to de|&s;troy the whole Race for that Sin, and being under the Engagement of that Covenant to do it,</HI> yet in the meer Operation of his own Goodne&s;s, deter|min'd to recover &s;inful Men from the Gulph of Death: To make this adequate or &s;uitable to his own infinite Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, he incarnated by a Miraculous Birth, the Divine Nature into the Humane; and cau&s;ed this Ble&s;&s;ed Conjunction to appear in the World in the likene&s;s of Sinful Fle&s;h; &s;o being infinite, God on the one hand, and Man on the other, he became capable of be|ing a compleat Sacrifice for Satisfaction of God's Ju&s;tice; and afterwards &s;uffering the Divine Wrath, made Peace for us <HI>by the Blood of his Cro&s;s;</HI> was Cru|cified, Dead and Buried, as you &s;ay in your Creed, ro&s;e again, is a&s;cended into Heaven, &s;its at the Right Hand of Power, and &s;hall come again to Judge us all: And this, Child, is call'd our Savi|our,

<P>You mu&s;t under&s;tand it gradually, <HI>my Dear,</HI> a little at a time; you can under&s;tand <HI>this,</HI> That we are all under a Sentence of Death for the Fir&s;t Man's Sin: <HI>By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin,</HI> Rom. 5. 12.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very plain, that the Effect of that fir&s;t Man's Sin is a corrupt Taint which we all bring into the World with us, and which we find upon our Nature, by which we find a Natural Pro|pen&s;ity in us to do Evil, and no Natural Inclination to do Good; and this we are to mourn over, and lament, as the Fountain of Sin, from whence all our wicked Actions do proceed; and this is call'd <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI></P>

<P>Yes, my Dear, <HI>the Blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth from all Sin,</HI> as well of Nature as of Life; and <HI>there is now no Condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> Rom. 8. 1.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>REPENTANCE</HI> Child, is a &s;ence of, and &s;incere &s;orrow for Sin in all its Parts; as well Original as Actual; and this Sorrow mu&s;t be always attended with a &s;incere De&s;ire of

Pardon, and Sanctification, and earne&s;t Endea|vours after Reformation and Amendment.

<P>What is this Book Father, that I call my Bible? <HI>who made it?</HI></P>

<P>It is the Word of <HI>God,</HI> written by him&s;elf.</P>

<P>What did God print it for us him&s;elf, Father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Child, God did not print it, or write it on the Paper, that is not the Ca&s;e; it was fir&s;t written by Holy Men of God, but it was dictated to them by the immediate In&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>No Child, there are not <HI>three Gods,</HI> GOD is but one infinite and undivided Being; but the <HI>Godhead</HI> is received and under&s;tood by us in Three Per&s;ons, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the&s;e Three are <HI>one God,</HI> the Maker and Judge of all.</P>

<P>When you, &s;peak of GOD, I can do no|thing but wonder! I cannot think of GOD! He is a great &s;omething, from whom I am, and for whom I am, and to whom I am; but I can't tell what God is, <HI>I wonder!</HI></P>

<P>He is incomprehen&s;ible, Child, <HI>you cannot by &s;earching find out</HI> God: But in this Book, <HI>the Bible,</HI> you may learn enough to &s;ave you, and bring you to him.</P>

<P>It is not &s;o much the getting the Words by Heart, <HI>Child,</HI> as getting <HI>the Word of Life</HI> wrought in your Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that Father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Child,</HI> to have the Spirit of God which wrote that Word, print it in your Mind, and give you Under&s;tanding both to read and obey it.</P>
</SP>

<P>And will he do that for me, Father? then I &s;hall not want you to teach me: But how if he won't teach me, Father?</P>

<P>Do that Child! <HI>the Spirit of God is</HI> GOD, and therefore can do all things; but it's the pecu|liar Work of the Spirit in this Ca&s;e; the Spirit is your Sanctifier; it is the Light of your Paths; it works Faith, and gives Repentance; it puts every good thing into you, and works every good Work for you; it gives a &s;aving Efficacy to every Ordi|nance; it brings you to Chri&s;t, to rely on him for

<P><HI>Yes, Child,</HI> for you cannot pray to God in Faith without the help of the Spirit; and when the Spirit works in you a Di&s;po&s;ition to pray, it cannot but an&s;wer its own Image, and the Breath|ings of the Soul, which its &s;elf has created; for <HI>the longing Soul &s;hall be &s;atisfied.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Child,</HI> the Bible is your Rule of Life: Tho' the Spirit is the &s;ecret In&s;tructor, the Scripture is the Key of In&s;truction; there you are to learn how <HI>God</HI> is to be wor&s;hipped; how to order your Con|ver&s;ation aright; how to perform your Duty, and <HI>what it is the Lord thy God requires of thee:</HI> There you have an Hi&s;torical Account of the whole World, of its Creation, the Fall, the fir&s;t Con|demnation of it, to a general Deluge; typical of the great Deluge of God's Wrath, which &s;hall drown all ungodly Men for ever: There you have the Hi&s;tory of God's Church from the Beginning to the Fullne&s;s of Time, and the fullfilling Old-Te&s;tament Types, and Old Te&s;tament Promi&s;es; there you have the Hi&s;tory of our Saviour, of his miraculous Conception and Birth, holy Life, won|drous Doctrine, &s;tupendious Miracles, his Death, Pa&s;&s;ion, Re&s;urrection, and Glorious A&s;cen&s;ion: There you have an Account of the fir&s;t Mi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and at la&s;t the whole Doctrine of the Go&s;pel of Truth, founded upon the Redemp|tion purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t: There you have the whole My&s;tery of Godline&s;s unfolded; the great
<PB N="31" REF="36">
<HI>Wonder of Wonders!</HI> the Immortal to die! and the Eternal to begin! the great De&s;truction of Sin, the Condemnation of the Devil, and the Salvation of the World.</P>
<P><HI>All this</HI> is to be &s;een in the Bible; which being <HI>the Word of God,</HI> you are to read it with Reve|rence, regard it with Faith, as the Word of God, and obey it, as your Rule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to pray for the Spirit to help me to do &s;o, <HI>mu&s;t I not, Father?</HI> For you told me I could not believe or under&s;tand it without the Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, <HI>Child.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Father,</HI> are you &s;ure that the Bible is the Word of God?</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes, Child, very &s;ure of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that the Spirit of God can only teach us to under&s;tand it?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Child.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, don't the Mini&s;ter under&s;tand it, and teach Folks to under&s;tand it; what do they go to Church for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Mini&s;ters are call'd <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Word,</HI> that is, Expounders of the Scriptures; and the Preaching of the Go&s;pel is one of the ordinary Means, as the reading the Word is another, by which the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Spirit of God</HI> in&s;tructs the Hearts of his People, and turns them to him&s;elf; reading the Word written, <HI>that is, the Bible,</HI> and hearing the Word preached, that is, the Sermons Preach|ed by God's Mini&s;ters, are the <HI>common</HI> Methods appointed, by which the Knowledge of God is con|veyed to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I mu&s;t go to Church and hear the Mini&s;ter preach, as well as read the Bible?</P>

<P>THE Father, as may be well imagined, warm'd with the various Thoughts that occurr'd to him upon this &s;urprizing Di&s;cour&s;e, was willing to get the Child away, that he might give Vent to his own Mind; and bringing the Child in, <HI>walks out</HI> again, till he was gotten to a Retirement, and then breaks out in a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate manner upon him&s;elf, giving full Vent to his Convictions in &s;uch a Manner as this:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"What an ungrateful Creature have I been to the Goodne&s;s and Bounty of God! That Good|ne&s;s and Bounty which has given me &s;o much Advantage, and &s;o many Ways to glorifie him, and honour him in the World, and to whom I owe my Life, my Being, and <HI>Well being</HI> in the World! And how has God reproved me in this little dear Creature!</P><P>"<HI>Wretch that I am!</HI> how have I liv'd <HI>as without God in the World!</HI> and in my Family! that I have not &s;o much as told my Children <HI>who made them,</HI> or let them know or gue&s;s by my Beha|viour that there is &s;uch a thing <HI>as a God</HI> in the World, or that any Wor&s;hip is due to a Sove|raign Almighty Being! How has this little Lamb complain'd to me! that <HI>he has never heard me pray to God in all his Life!</HI> and it is but too true! How did it reproach me when I &s;poke to it of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</HI> To hear the little Creature &s;ay, <HI>Who is that, Father!</HI> And of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t, Who is that, Father!</HI> And of &s;erving God, <HI>Do you &s;erve him, Father!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="40">
"What a Life have I led! Good Lord, what have I been doing! How &s;hall I account to thee for the Souls committed to my Charge!

<P>Tears followed the Parent's Speech, and he prays earne&s;tly to God to forgive him the Neglect and Omi&s;&s;ion of his Duty to his Children and Family, and enters into a &s;ecret Engagement between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>his own Soul,</HI> that for the future he will &s;et up the due and daily Wor&s;hip of God in his Family, and will diligently and carefully in&s;truct his Chil|dren, teaching them the Knowledge of God, and how to &s;erve him, and walk in his Ways.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Compo&s;ure of Mind upon this Re&s;o|lution, a new Trouble breaks in upon him; he had <HI>elder Children</HI> than this, and he had liv'd in a con|tinual Neglect of his Duty, either in teaching them the Knowledge of God, or &s;hewing them a Reli|gious Example: The&s;e Children had contracted a prophane Habit both in Words, Manners, and con&s;tant Practice; had little Inclination to Reli|gion, le&s;s Knowledge, and <HI>no Thoughts at all</HI> about their Souls, and began to be <HI>too Old,</HI> and <HI>too Big</HI> to be wrought upon by In&s;truction or Per&s;wa&s;ion, much le&s;s by Violence and Correction.</P>
<P>When this Reflection came upon the Parent's Thoughts after the Convictions he had met with from the little Enquirer afore&s;aid, this brought a &s;econd Flood of Tears from him, and he breaks out <HI>thus:</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord what will become of my poor wretched Family! my other Children! my unin&s;tructed unreproved Children! What an In&s;trument have I been in the Ruin of their Souls! How does it all lie upon me as a Weight never to be

remov'd; they are grown up, yet they know nothing of God, but to take his Name in vain! They neither call upon him, nor have I taught them to do &s;o!

Merci|ful God! why have I not been removed, and in Mercy to them as well as in Judgment to my &s;elf, been &s;natch'd from them, that &s;ome other Per&s;on might have been &s;et over them more for the good of their Souls.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Convictions, <HI>the Man prays earne&s;tly</HI> to the Lord to pardon the heinous Offence of his neglecting his Duty to his Children; that God would &s;upply by the teaching of his Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, that great want of Family-In&s;truction in his Chil|dren which he has been the Cau&s;e of; that he would work Convictions upon them, and would continue to &s;tir him up to his Duty in the future directing, teaching, and governing his Family.</P>
<P>But what a hard Task he has with his other Children, and how difficult a Work it is to bring Children to a Sen&s;e of God and Religion after their green and tender Years are pa&s;t, in which they are moulded <HI>like Wax to a Seal,</HI> to receive &s;uch fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions as the Per&s;wa&s;ion and Example of Parents are apt to make, <HI>will be apparent in the fol|lowing Dialogues.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Notes</HI> on the Fir&s;t Dialogue.</HEAD>
<P>THE ob&s;erving Reader will &s;ee here, that the Author to ob&s;erve a ju&s;t Equality between all Opinions, and in order to make this work generally u&s;eful and acceptable to all Denomina|tions of Chri&s;tians, and to all among them who &s;e|riou&s;ly apply them&s;elves to the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Eternal Salvation, has kept him&s;elf in the An&s;wers to this little Child's Enquiry, to the plain general Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, where|in he has neither pre&s;cribed him&s;elf in Method or in Words to the Catechi&s;ms of either the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m, or any o|ther; but laid down the Principles of Religion con&s;onant to them all, as plainly as he could, as they are deduc'd from the Holy Scriptures, and as they agree with the &s;everal Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith and Doctrinal Articles as well of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as of all the Prote&s;tant Churches and Congregations in <HI>Europe,</HI> who profe&s;s the &s;ame Faith, believe the &s;ame God, and hope for Eternal Life thro' Faith in the &s;ame ever Ble&s;&s;ed Interce&s;|&s;or and Redeemer.</P>
<P>If any particular Chri&s;tian's Opinion may carry them further, or not &s;o far as the Author has ex|pre&s;s'd him&s;elf here in the Doctrines of Original Sin, Election of Grace, Repentance, and Faith in Chri&s;t, he prays, that while they can allow what is laid down here to be Orthodox in the Sub&s;tance, they will extend the &s;ame Charity to his De&s;ign, as he does to their Opinion, <HI>(viz.),</HI> To leave room for further Explanations, to judge the be&s;t, and to con&s;ider that as this Part is &s;poken to a Child, and is for Children to read for their In&s;truction, it requires to be plain and conci&s;e, and <HI>&s;o be it</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="43">
that it be e&s;&s;entially right; the more adapted it is to the meane&s;t Under&s;tandings, the better it an|&s;wers the De&s;ign of this Undertaking.</P>
<P>Some may think the Child here is brought in too often falling upon the Father with a Charge of not in&s;tructing him, and not praying with him, and not telling him the&s;e things &s;ooner; but to &s;uch it may be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that as this is one of the great De&s;igns of this Work, and is not &s;poken &s;o directly to, in any other Part, it requir'd to be more than ordinarily pointed out here; e&s;pecially becau&s;e that upon the&s;e iittle Reprehen&s;ions of this infant, are grounded the &s;everal mo&s;t con&s;iderable Parts of the Dialogues which follow in the fir&s;t Part: As particularly, the Convictions wrought by it upon the Father, mention'd at the end of the Dialogue, where he is brought in retiring him&s;elf to give Vent to his Soul, in reflecting on the breach of his Duty, and in Prayer to God; al&s;o the con|curring Convictions wrought by the &s;ame Method, and by the &s;ame In&s;trument, upon the Mother, as in the &s;econd Dialogue, and more e&s;pecially the Re&s;olution of both to reform them&s;elves, and to do their Duties more effectually in their Families.</P>
<P>The&s;e appearing, as is ob&s;erv'd to be the main De&s;ign of this fir&s;t Part, and indeed &s;omething of this running thro' the whole Cour&s;e of the Work, it could not but be needful to let tho&s;e little &s;harp Reproofs innocently expre&s;s'd by the little Child in the fir&s;t Dialogue, be often repreated; e&s;pecially where the Sen&s;e brought them in with a kind of natural, uncon&s;train'd Innocence in the Expre&s;&s;ion, as is generally carefully ordered where-ever tho&s;e Reproofs are to be met with: Nor indeed could the Expre&s;&s;ions of the Parents, either in their pri|vate Ejaculations, or mutual conver&s;ing upon that Part one with another, have been con&s;onant to the
<PB N="39" REF="44">
re&s;t of the Work, or the cadence of things pre|&s;erv'd, if this had not been laid as a Foundation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Notes are not de&s;ign'd to talk over again the whole Subject of every Di&s;cour&s;e, if the Parts de&s;erve any Comment, every con&s;idering Chri&s;tian will make it to them&s;elves as they go; but where the Ca&s;e is particular, a Word may be &s;aid, which in the Dialogues would have been digre&s;ling too long, and have made it tedious.</P>
<P>From the Enquiries of the Child may be ob&s;erv'd, how naturally the Connexion of Go&s;pel-Truths, one with another, appears; I mean tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential to our Salvation: How bright a Chain, and how clo&s;ely hanging one upon another, in a Climax that cannot but be admirable to ob&s;erve, is the great My&s;tery of Man's Fall and Recovery, Sin entring into the World, Death by Sin, Nature cor|rupted by the Fall, &s;anctified by redeeming Grace; <HI>by the Offence of one Man many made Sinners; by the Obedience of one many made Righteous;</HI> Ju&s;tice offended by Sin, eternal Death denounc'd as the Puni&s;hment; Ju&s;tice &s;atisfied by a Redeemer, Eter|nal Life the Con&s;equence; <HI>No Condemnation to them who are in Chri&s;t:</HI> The&s;e things lie &s;o plain, &s;o natural, and in &s;o exact an Order, that Nature &s;eems to direct the Child, who knows nothing of them, to force them from the Father, by the Power of the mo&s;t Innocent unin&s;tructed Enquiries.</P>
<P>How unaccountably to blame are tho&s;e Parents who let their Children know nothing of the&s;e things, till their own little, innocent Enquiries ex|tort it from them!</P>
<P>How naturally does the Di&s;cour&s;e of this little Child reprove Parents for their Neglect of the Sab|bath Day's Work, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of attending the publick Wor&s;hip of God; and how could the Child but &s;up|po&s;e that going to Church was only a light Matter,

&s;ince his Father very &s;eldom went him&s;elf, and &s;tay'd at home upon the mo&s;t frivolous Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Child's Di&s;cour&s;e about going to Church only to &s;hew his fine Cloaths, and his Mother and Si&s;ter's being chiefly employ'd there, to ob&s;erve the Fa&s;hions and Dre&s;&s;es of their Neighbours, with the Conver&s;ation they have of tho&s;e things after they come home, needs no Enlargements here; the Con&s;ciences of mo&s;t young People in our own Fa|milies will teach them to apply that Part to them|&s;elves; and the Author is content to leave it out, if it is not generally acknowledg'd to be a needful Reproof. The Child is brought in here &s;everal times &s;aying to his Father, when he &s;peaks of &s;er|ving, loving, and praying to God, <HI>Do you do &s;o, Father?</HI> This puts me in mind of a Story not im|proper to be related: A wicked Boy that had been addicted to Swearing and ill words, was reproved by his Father with more Seriou&s;ne&s;s than u&s;ual, and his Father toid him, that God heard him: The Father, it &s;eems, was a Man of no Religion, or at|lea&s;t of very ill Morals him&s;elf; but what he hap|pen'd to &s;ay to the Boy, &s;truck him &s;o deeply, that it was a means of Conviction to the Child; but Ignorance having been the Boy's greate&s;t Un|happine&s;s, when he came to con&s;ider of what his Father had &s;aid, he asks one of the Family whether God could &s;ee as well as hear? when he was an|&s;wer'd, yes, That God was Infinite, and could hear and &s;ee all things: He told them he could not believe it; <HI>for my Father was drunk la&s;t Night,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;ure he would not have been Drunk if God could &s;ee him,</HI> el&s;e <HI>why did he tell me I &s;hould not Swear, becau&s;e God could hear me?</HI></P>
<P>If Parents knew, or at lea&s;t con&s;ider'd, the Influence their evil Examples have upon their Children, and how fatal an Encouragement to
<PB N="41" REF="46">
Sin it is to any Children to be able to &s;ay, <HI>My Father does &s;o him&s;elf,</HI> the Pre&s;ence of their Children would be a greater Re&s;traint to Con|&s;cientious Parents, <HI>even in Things in them&s;elves indifferent, much more in Things really &s;inful,</HI> than it is po&s;&s;ible the Pre&s;ence and Awe of the Parent can be to the Children: It is enough that Religious Parents have to &s;truggle with in the per|ver&s;e and wicked Inclinations of their Children; but they will find, tho&s;e Liberties their Children take from the Encouragement of their Parents Example, will be ten times more difficult to re&s;train <HI>afterwards,</HI> than tho&s;e they have from their own Inclination, or the Example of others: It enner|vates all the Exhortations of a Father; takes the Edge off from their Reprehen&s;ion; makes their Re&s;entment &s;eem unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable, and makes the Child rather apt to retort the Practice of the Parent upon them&s;elves, than receive pa|tiently and meekly the Admonition.</P>
<P>I humbly recommend this Thought to tho&s;e Pa|rents who indulge them&s;elves in any Vanities or Exce&s;&s;es, &s;uch as in Pa&s;&s;ion, in ha&s;ty Expre&s;&s;ions, in Expences, in wa&s;te of Time, in ill Words, in Gaming, nay, or any of tho&s;e things <HI>which the World are apt to call Lawful and Innocent;</HI> If &s;uch things <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be indulg'd, and <HI>you will</HI> allow your &s;elves in them, upon a Pre&s;umption that <HI>you</HI> can do them innocently; at lea&s;t then, conceal them from your Children, le&s;t what you can u&s;e with Moderation, they fall into with Exce&s;s, and ju&s;tify the Practice from your Example.</P>
<P>It will be a very uncomfortable Reflection, and will fill the Mind with bitter Reproaches if ever God plea&s;es to try &s;uch Parents, when they &s;hall &s;ee the Introduction to their Children's Ruin for|med and begun in their [<HI>the Parents</HI>] Example;
<PB N="42" REF="47">
nor will it be any alleviation to their Sorrow, to &s;ay, I us'd tho&s;e Diver&s;ions moderately, and kept my &s;elf within Compa&s;s; it was but very &s;eldom that I us'd an ill Word; I play'd at Cards but very moderately, and never for much Money; I &s;eldom drank hard, and the like. Our Moderation in Diver&s;ions &s;hall introduce our Children's Exce&s;s; and if the Apo&s;tle, rather than offend a weak Bro|ther, would wholly ab&s;tain even from Part of his nece&s;&s;ary Su&s;tenance, <HI>(viz.) eating of Fle&s;h;</HI> how much more &s;hould Parents refrain their Exce&s;&s;es, nay, even their lawful Diver&s;ions, rather than lay a Foundation of the Ruin of their Children, and prompt them to Sin, by giving them a Pretence from, or Encouragement by their <HI>Father's</HI> Example.</P>
<P>From the whole of this Dialogue, Parents may &s;ee, be&s;ides their Duty to God, what they owe to their Children, in timely and early in&s;tructing them; how much in&s;tructing our Children is a Debt to them; and how unju&s;t and injurious we are to our Children in omitting to In&s;truct them. What moving Expre&s;&s;ions of the Child to the Fa|ther are the&s;e: <HI>Dear Father,</HI> &s;ays the Child, <HI>why would you not tell me of it before?</HI> Was you angry with me, Father? And what if it &s;hould be too late now! Will not God puni&s;h me Everla&s;tingly now becau&s;e I have not known this &s;ooner! How cutting mu&s;t it be to a Parent that has any Sen&s;e of Eter|nity, to think that his dear Children &s;hould be lo&s;t by his Example, or remain blind by his Omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other Ob&s;ervations might be made here from the Particulars of this fir&s;t Dia|logue, but it is hop'd the reading the Dialogue its &s;elf will cau&s;e many of them to occur; and the Brevity of this Work admits not our Notes to be too long.</P>

<HEAD>Notes on the Second Dialogue.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t ob&s;erve of the Child's being carried to Church, That by the Word Church, or going to Church, in all the&s;e Dialogues, is to be under|&s;tood the Place, and <HI>going to</HI> the Place of publick Wor&s;hip, whether in the Church of <HI>England</HI> People to their Pari&s;h Churches, or in Di&s;&s;enters to their &s;everal Meeting-Hou&s;es, the particular di&s;tingui&s;hing it one way or another being &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided here; the Subject, as the Author humbly conceives, being not at all concern'd in our diver|&s;ity of Opinions, Sects, or &s;eparate A&s;&s;emblies, but equally in&s;tructing to all who call them&s;elves Chri|&s;tians, and e&s;pecially Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tians; he believes it would be very much Wrong to lay a Stumbling-block at the Thre&s;hold, and to put any Prejudice in the Minds of the &s;erious Readers; which al&s;o might prevent by Partiality to Opi|nions, the Benefit which may otherwi&s;e be univer|&s;al to Chri&s;tians of all Opinions what&s;oever; and this Latitude in his Charity, and in his De&s;ign of doing Good to all, he hopes none will be offended at.</P>
<P>The Father and Mother of this little Child ap|pear here to be no ignorant Per&s;ons in the Princi|ples or Duties of Chri&s;tianity; but as to the re&s;t it may be ob&s;erv'd. (1) What a wretched irreli|gious
<PB N="55" REF="60">
Life &s;ome of tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t Share of Knowledge in Matters of Religion do lead, e&s;pecially in their Families. (2.) What Re|gret it brings upon their Minds when they are convinc'd of their Wickedne&s;s in the Neglect of their Families, and when, as in this ca&s;e, much of it may be too late to be retriev'd.</P>
<P>(3.) What bitter Reproaches &s;uch Children oftentimes ca&s;t back upon their Parents, when they [<HI>the Children</HI>] come to find what they have lo&s;t for want of a godly, religious Education, and early In&s;truction, either good Children or bad.</P>
<P>If the Children prove &s;ober and religious with|out the helps of In&s;truction, <HI>for the Spirit of God is not confin'd or con&s;train'd to the&s;e outward Helps,</HI> how are they a&s;ham'd of, and a Shame to their Parents! And how mu&s;t the Parents blu&s;h when they may upon any Occa&s;ion be told, that the Knowledge, the Piety, the Fear of God, which is found in their Children, is no Product of their planting, no Fruit of what they had &s;own; Reli|gious Children of prophane or negligent Parents, are a double Te&s;timony to powerful invincible Grace, but a dreadful Reproach to the Parents.</P>
<P>This may be a Thought worthy the Con&s;idera|tion of any Chri&s;tian Parent, that having neglected the In&s;truction of their Families, and neglected teaching, and praying with, or for their Children, what a ju&s;t Contempt will tho&s;e Children naturally have for tho&s;e Parents, e&s;pecially if ever God comes to enlighten their Hearts, and open their Eyes, <HI>as he &s;ometimes does without the help of Pater|nal In&s;truction;</HI> when the Children come to reflect how their Parents totally neglected the Salvation of their Souls, compar'd to which, the Provi&s;ion made for their Bodies was but of little Value, the Di&s;gu&s;t at the Omi&s;&s;ion of the former, will be too
<PB N="56" REF="61">
apt to take off all the Gratitude and Affection due for the latter.</P>
<P>Nothing but meer Duty can be &s;uppo&s;ed to pre|&s;erve the Child's Re&s;pect, and even common Civi|lity to its Parents, when he comes to be &s;en&s;ible how unnaturally they abandon'd his Immortal Part; how unchri&s;tianly they expos'd his better, his intellectual Part, to Eternal De&s;truction, as if the Duty of a Parent had ended, or been re&s;train'd within the narrow Compa&s;s of the Office of a Nur&s;e, or a Schoolma&s;ter; and that they had no Obligation upon them to regard the eternal Hap|pine&s;s of that Part of their Po&s;terity which can never die.</P>
<P>Such Parents are certainly the mo&s;t unnatural, and may ju&s;tly be reproach'd by their Children, not with neglect of their Duty <HI>only,</HI> but with their being without Natural Affections, and con&s;equently can by no means expect &s;uitable returns of Af|fection from their Children, when they come to be made &s;en&s;ible of the Treatment they have re|ceiv'd from them; if they &s;how them common Re&s;pect, <HI>as above,</HI> it mu&s;t be all owing to that very Grace, which in &s;pight of the Ob&s;tructions of a Godle&s;s Education, has been planted in the Heart by the powerful Influence, and invincible Operation of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>For Parents to pretend Love to their Children, and Natural Affection, as they are the Fruit of their Bodies, and <HI>(as is vulgarly expre&s;s'd)</HI> their own Fle&s;h and Blood, and at the &s;ame time neglect to in&s;truct them, or educate them either in human Learning, or religious Knowledge, is ju&s;t as if, when their Children are taken &s;ick, they &s;hould employ them&s;elves in mending or making them Cloaths, or dre&s;&s;ing up fine Banquets or Entertain|ments for them, and wholly omit the nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="57" REF="62">
Cordials or Applications for the Recovery of their Health; <HI>only with this difference,</HI> that the Soul to the Body has infinitely a greater Di&s;proportion than the Health, and the daily Food.</P>
<P><HI>But our Ca&s;e extends yet farther,</HI> viz. That the Defect complain'd of here, is not the want of E|ducation and In&s;truction, from the Ignorance or Incapacity of the Parent; for this had been the Hand of God immediately in bringing forth the Child from Parents that knew not God; but <HI>the Ca&s;e here</HI> is yet more aggravated, in that <HI>this hap|pens</HI> in Families where the Parents have the Know|ledge, and have the Capacity, and know, and acknowledge it to be their Duty to in&s;truct their Children, and yet entirely neglect it, which adds to the Crime in the Parent, and will be ground of A&s;toni&s;hment and Reflection in the Children, <HI>if they ever come to the Knowledge of God without the due A&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> of their Parents. Nor will the Re|flections of the Parents be le&s;s bitter on them&s;elves than tho&s;e of their Children, as will be more lively repre&s;ented in the other Dialogues of this Part.</P>
<P>But this Subject may al&s;o be of pre&s;ent U&s;e to Children who have not the Ble&s;&s;ing of Godly Pa|rents to in&s;truct them, and for this it is al&s;o de|&s;ign'd; and the&s;e as well as tho&s;e who&s;e Parents neglect the great Duty of in&s;tructing them, are de&s;ir'd to con&s;ider from the Example of this little Child the&s;e few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the mo&s;t plain, mo&s;t natural, and mo&s;t|ea&s;ie que&s;tions that it is po&s;&s;ible a Child can ask, will lead them to know both their Creator, and their Duty to him: <HI>Such as,</HI><LIST>

<P>This is the great End of <HI>the&s;e Dialogues,</HI> as they re&s;pect Children, <HI>viz.</HI> That they may, <HI>where per|haps Family-In&s;truction has been wanting,</HI> guide them&s;elves to the Knowledge of God, and of their Duty, by the&s;e familiar Steps which Nature it &s;elf will be mo&s;t certain to concur with.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s to you how the little Creature mov'd me; it was a Dagger <HI>&s;truck into my very Heart</HI> to hear the <HI>dear Lamb</HI> ask me, Father, <HI>will not God be angry with me that I have not thank'd him, and lov'd him, and pray'd to him before? And how &s;hould I know it,</HI> Father, <HI>you ne|ver told me!</HI> When I told him he mu&s;t pray to God, was it not cutting me to the Heart to hear it &s;ay, <HI>Do you pray to him, Father?</HI> And when I told him <HI>Yes,</HI> to have him &s;ay, <HI>I never hear'd you, Father:</HI> I was not able to bear it, I was fain to &s;top, and turn away from him.</P>

<P>I believe we may both &s;ay as the Di&s;ciples at <HI>Emmaus, Did not our Hearts burn within us when he talked to us by the Way?</HI> For my Part, I am amaz'd when I look upon the Child, but <HI>when I look in,</HI> and reflect how I have neglected the great Duty of in&s;tructing <HI>not this Child only,</HI> but all my Children, <HI>I am confounded,</HI> and not able to hold up my Head: How ju&s;tly may my Children re|proach me! not only with omitting to teach them to do good, but with abominably encouraging them

to Vanity, and neglect of God, by my Example: O I have ruin'd all my Children!</P>

<P><HI>No no,</HI> you have not ruin'd them, <HI>it is I</HI> have ruin'd them; for it was my Duty to have exercis'd the Authority <HI>of a Father,</HI> and of a Go|vernour of a Hou&s;e; to have &s;et up the Wor&s;hip of God in my Family; to have prayed <HI>with them,</HI> and <HI>for them,</HI> and in&s;tructed them to pray <HI>for them&s;elves;</HI> they could not have ask'd me then whether <HI>they might</HI> pray to God, or whether <HI>ever</HI> I prayed to God <HI>or no.</HI></P>

<P>And <HI>I have</HI> been a great Cau&s;e of your neglecting that Part too, for I have &s;lighted it, and ridicul'd it in others, and thought it meer O&s;tentation, and Form; as if none but Per&s;ons of higher Quality &s;hould have Prayers in their Fa|mily, and thought it look'd too big for us.</P>

<P>Ay, but <HI>my Temptation</HI> has been of another kind, I have thought it a Solemnity I was <HI>not fit</HI> for; I have que&s;tion'd my own Performance; I have often thought, if I was a <HI>Nobleman</HI> I would keep a Chaplain, but I was a&s;ham'd to pray in the Hearing of my Servants and Children, as if that was di&s;honourable and mean, which was my na|tural Duty; or as if I was a&s;ham'd to own that which was the Glory of a Chri&s;tian, <HI>viz. To wor|&s;hip and call upon him that made him;</HI> as if Nature, which dictates to the lea&s;t Child, to call and cry to its Father and Mother for Bread, <HI>when it is an hungry,</HI> did not dictate to me, and to every ratio|nal Creature to wor&s;hip that God in whom we live and move, and have our Being!</P>

<P>There is no Difficulty in re&s;olving what Cour&s;e to take with this little Infant, <HI>he is taught from Heaven,</HI> and the Spirit of God is vi&s;ibly working in him; if we do not <HI>in&s;truct him,</HI> he

<HEAD><HI>Notes</HI> on the Third Dialogue.</HEAD>
<P>WHat a great deal of Work have tho&s;e People behind-hand, who do not begin to in&s;truct and re&s;train their Children till they are too big for Correction! <HI>Folly that is bound up in the Heart of a Child, &s;ays</HI> Solomon, is driven <HI>thence by the Rod of Correction:</HI> But when it remains in the Child, and neither the <HI>Rod</HI> of Correction, or the <HI>Voice</HI> of In&s;truction is made u&s;e of <HI>to drive it out,</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="73">
till the Child grows up to be a Man, it is very hard, nay impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>but by a &s;upernatural A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> to drive it out at all. <HI>What this Folly is,</HI> needs no De&s;cription here, other than an allow'd Cu&s;tom in doing Evil, a natural Propen&s;ity we all have to Evil; with this we are all born into the World, the Soul is originally bent to <HI>Folly;</HI> this Bent or Inclination mu&s;t be rectified, <HI>or driven out</HI> either by <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> or if that proves in&s;ufficient, by <HI>Correction;</HI> and it is to be done while the Per&s;on is <HI>young,</HI> while he is a <HI>Child,</HI> and then <HI>IT MAY</HI> be done. The Child <HI>may</HI> be wrought upon; Na|ture like &s;ome Vegetables, is malleable when ta|ken <HI>green</HI> and <HI>early;</HI> but hard and brittle when condens'd by Time and Age; <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> it bows and bends to In&s;truction and Reproof, but afterwards ob&s;tinately refu&s;es both.</P>
<P>The Temper of a Child mi&s;led by Vice or Mi|&s;take, <HI>like a di&s;located Bone,</HI> is ea&s;ie to be reduc'd into its Place, <HI>if taken in time;</HI> but if &s;uffer'd to|remain in its di&s;located Po&s;ition, a callous Sub&s;tance fills up <HI>the empty Space,</HI> and by neglect grows e|qually hard with the Bone, and re&s;i&s;ting the Power of the Surgeon's Skill, renders <HI>the Reduction</HI> of the Joynt impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Heart of the tender Youth, by forbearance of In&s;truction, grows opinionated, and ob&s;tinately embraces the Follies he has been indulg'd in, not being ea&s;ily convinc'd of the criminal Quality of what he has been &s;o long allow'd the Practice of <HI>by his negligent Parents;</HI> and this renders late In&s;truction fruitle&s;s: <HI>THEN as to Correction,</HI> the Heart being hardned, as before, by Opinion and Practice, and e&s;pecially in a Belief that he <HI>ought not to be corrected,</HI> the Rod of Correction has a different Effect; for as <HI>the Blow</HI> of a Stripe makes an Impre&s;&s;ion on the Heart of a Child, as &s;tamping
<PB N="69" REF="74">
a Seal does upon the &s;oft Wax, the Reproof even of Words on the &s;ame Heart when grown up, and made hard, is like &s;triking upon Steel, which in|&s;tead of making an Impre&s;&s;ion <HI>on the Metal,</HI> darts back &s;parks of Fire in your Face.</P>
<P>As this whole Work is chiefly de&s;ign'd to con|vince Parents of the Nece&s;&s;ity of beginning early the great Work of in&s;tructing and managing their Children, &s;o <HI>two things</HI> will run more vi&s;ibly thro' every Part of it.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>For their Encouragement,</HI> the Examples of the ea&s;ine&s;s and advantages of early In&s;truction will be &s;een: How &s;oft! how pliable the Minds of little Children are! how like Wax they lie, ready to be moulded into any Form, and receive any Impre&s;&s;ion, that the diligent Application of Parents thinks fit to make upon them! From whence al&s;o Parents <HI>are warned</HI> to be very careful, that by their Example or Negligence, tho&s;e fir&s;t &s;oftned Circum&s;tances of their Childrens Minds <HI>are not pa&s;s'd over</HI> without &s;uitable Applications, to forming them a right, filling them with Learn|ing and Knowledge, and with ju&s;t Principles, both religious and moral; <HI>above all,</HI> that they receive no bad Impre&s;&s;ions from the Practice of their Pa|rents, who&s;e Example, <HI>e&s;pecially in Evil,</HI> takes &s;uch deep Root in their Children, that nothing is more difficult to remove.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>For Warning, and &s;erious Caution,</HI> by letting them &s;ee the dreadful Effects of the neglecting their Children when young; what Work it makes for Repentance in both; what breaches it makes in Families, when Nece&s;&s;ity drives them to begin that Work late; what Treatment they are like to meet with from their Children; how the&s;e will think it hard to be in&s;tructed when grown up; count it impo&s;ing upon them in their Parents, re|ject
<PB N="70" REF="75">
the Arguments their Parents &s;hall u&s;e; de&s;pi&s;e and contemn their Reproof; think them&s;elves pa&s;t Correction, and turn their Backs not only upon all the Methods their Parents &s;hall take with them, but even upon their Parents them&s;elves, when they attempt by Government and Di&s;cipline to retrieve the Error they have committed.</P>
<P>In this <HI>la&s;t Dialogue</HI> the Husband and Wife ap|pear &s;en&s;ible of their Mi&s;take this way, and the Difficulties they have before them in retrieving it, <HI>ju&s;tly appear terrible,</HI> almo&s;t drive them to de&s;pair of the Succe&s;s, and to give over any Thoughts of the Attempt; in the &s;ub&s;equent Parts of this Work we &s;hall find they were not mi&s;taken in the Pro&s;pect they had of the Difficulty before them, or of the Ob&s;tinacy and Oppo&s;ition which they &s;hould meet with from their Children.</P>
<P>As to their being <HI>&s;o di&s;courag'd</HI> as not to make the Attempt, the Husband argues wi&s;ely, that it is not le&s;s their Duty for its having been delay'd; that it mu&s;t be &s;et about, let the Difficulty be what it will; and that therefore <HI>he is re&s;olv'd</HI> to attempt it, and if po&s;&s;ible, to go thro' it, leaving the Succe&s;s to God.</P>
<P>This is a wi&s;e and Chri&s;tian Re&s;olution, and argues that the Convictions the Parent was under, were &s;anctified by the Spirit of God, and carried on to effectual Conver&s;ion; <HI>for</HI> all Conviction of Sin that do not go on to Reformation and effectual Application to our Duty, are ineffectual Con|victions; <HI>like waking in a Dream,</HI> while the Heart is a&s;leep, when &s;lumbering on, we fall into the &s;ame Dream again.</P>
<P>For the encouraging Parents to pur&s;ue the&s;e Convictions, and to hope for &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s in their Work, tho' begun late, and under &s;ome weighty Di&s;couragements, <HI>the following Part of this Work</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="76">
<HI>will &s;hew</HI> how far he met with Succe&s;s in his Family Reformation and In&s;truction, as well as what Ob|&s;truction he met with from his Elde&s;t Children, for all were not alike ob&s;tinate and refractory as the Elde&s;t were; and the Mother was but too true a Prophete&s;s of the Con&s;equence from their Ob|&s;tinacy.</P>
<P><HI>From the Di&s;cour&s;e between the Husband and Wife</HI> under their Convictions, may be &s;een &s;omething of the Duty of &s;uch Relations.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) To communicate to one another their Griefs, and mo&s;t inward Afflictions of Mind, as well as their common Di&s;a&s;ters and Troubles of the World: This is one Part of the Duty of Husband and Wife to one another, <HI>tho' under&s;tood by few,</HI> meant and included in that Phra&s;e, <HI>AN HELP-MEET;</HI> and it is ob&s;ervable, that when &s;uch near Relations do affectionately communi|cate to one another their Souls Concerns <HI>in &s;uch a manner as I &s;peak of now,</HI> God is often pleas'd &s;o variou&s;ly to act in the Minds of &s;uch by his Spirit, that they &s;hall in their Turns be mutually able to a&s;&s;i&s;t, comfort, direct, and coun&s;el one another: This, <HI>if it were well ob&s;erv'd,</HI> would be very u&s;eful and encouraging to Chri&s;tian Relations in their mo&s;t &s;erious and re&s;erv'd Reflections; where they might take notice how that Party that is di&s;cou|rag'd and dejected <HI>to Day,</HI> and receives Support and Encouragements, Relief and Direction from the Coun&s;el and comforting A&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>of the other,</HI> &s;hall be re&s;tor'd and comforted, and perhaps enabled <HI>the next time</HI> to give the &s;ame Encourage|ment, Coun&s;el, Advice and Comfort to the other, who may in like manner be &s;unk under his own Fears and Temptations!</P>
<P>This I thought fit to recommend in the mo&s;t earne&s;t Terms, and from ju&s;t Experience, to the
<PB N="72" REF="77">
Con&s;ideration of Chri&s;tian Relations, as a u&s;eful Ob&s;ervation, <HI>in hope</HI> it may be improv'd by the Experience of others, to the Glory of God, and their own Comfort.</P>
<P N="2">(2) The Duty of Parents <HI>may be &s;een here,</HI> as it re&s;pects the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting about the great Work of Family-Reformation, <HI>however late,</HI> and whatever the Di&s;couragements may be: <HI>The Father here</HI> expre&s;&s;es this affectionately to his Wife, <HI>Our Children,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>may be &s;till lo&s;t,</HI> notwith&s;tanding our Endeavour; but we are &s;ure to be lo&s;t if we continue to neglect it.</P>
<P><HI>From the&s;e Con&s;iderations</HI> the Father re&s;olves to &s;et about the Work, and immediately gives his Wife an Account of the Method he propo&s;es to him&s;elf to go upon; in which Method, like a prudent Man, and good Chri&s;tian, he propo&s;es a &s;erious mutual Humiliation <HI>to his Wife</HI> for their former neglect of their Duty, and a fervent praying to God for his Ble&s;&s;ing upon their Endea|vours in their Family-Reformation.</P>
<P>Hence is intimated, and &s;eriou&s;ly recommended to Parents and Heads of Families, the great Work which is &s;o much neglected, or rather &s;o little regarded, of a Family joining in Confe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Sins, <HI>I mean of Husband and Wife,</HI> which they have joined in the committing; would Hus|bands and Wives join &s;eriou&s;ly in humbling them|&s;elves together before God, for tho&s;e Family-Sins which they have join'd in the guilt of, Family-Reformation would be &s;et about with much more Earne&s;tne&s;s and Application <HI>than now</HI> we &s;ee it is, and many Ob&s;tructions to it, which happen by our Willingne&s;s to excu&s;e our &s;elves, would be removed.</P>

<HEAD>The Fourth DIALOGUE</HEAD>
<P>FOR the better under&s;tanding this Di&s;|cour&s;e, it is to be under&s;tood, that the Father and Mother, according to their Re&s;olution in the la&s;t Dialogue, <HI>had &s;et effectually</HI> about the Reformation of their Family, and about proper Methods for reducing their Children to an Obedience <HI>to,</HI> and Sence <HI>of</HI> their Duty.</P>
<P>Their Children were mo&s;t of them grown up, and had run a great length, they had been in|dulg'd in all po&s;&s;ible Folly and Levity, &s;uch as <HI>Plays, Gaming, Loo&s;ene&s;s</HI> of Life, and <HI>Irreligious</HI> Behaviour; not immode&s;t or di&s;hone&s;t, That they were not yet arrived to; but they were bred up with <HI>Gayety</HI> and <HI>Gallantry,</HI> as being of good For|tunes and Fa&s;hion; but nothing of Religion, more than ju&s;t the common cour&s;e of going to Church, which they did becau&s;e it was the Cu&s;tom and Fa&s;hion, rather than with any other View; and being thus unhappily Educated, we &s;hall find the In&s;truction they were now to bear, met with the more Oppo&s;ition in them, and we &s;hall &s;ee how it had a various Effect according to the different Temper and Con&s;titution of the Children.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="80">
Their elde&s;t Daughter was about eighteen Years old, and her Mother, it &s;eems, began with her fir&s;t: Her Mother found it a very difficult matter to deal with her; for when &s;he came to tell her of laying by her fooli&s;h Romances and Novels, <HI>of which &s;he was mighty fond;</HI> leaving off her Patches and Play-Books; refu&s;ing her going to the Park on the Sabbath-Days, <HI>and the like,</HI> &s;he flew out in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and told her Mother, <HI>in plain words,</HI> &s;he would not be hinder'd; &s;he was pa&s;t a Child, &s;he would go to the Park, and to the Play, <HI>and the like,</HI> ay that &s;he would.</P>

<PB N="83" REF="88">
Children, but that he begg'd God Pardon for that Omi&s;&s;ion, and would do his be&s;t to make us all amends: He concluded with asking me, whether I had rather <HI>be a Rake,</HI> or a <HI>Sober Man:</HI> I an&s;wer'd, I hop'd he did not expect any Re|ply from me to that, and that I hop'd I had not gone &s;o far as to make him doubt in the lea&s;t that I did not de&s;ign to be a Sober Man. <HI>Why, Son,</HI> replies my Father, you have no other way to do this, but to conclude, that if there were <HI>no</HI> Divine Law, <HI>no</HI> Future State, <HI>no</HI> Rewards or Puni&s;hments; yet, regarding the Honour and Character which you expect in the World, you ought to be Sober, if it were only to pre&s;erve your Reputation: <HI>He told me,</HI> that I knew he had de&s;ign'd me for the Practice of the Law; that tho' he would do what he could for me, yet, as he had a great many other Children, I mu&s;t expect to live, <HI>or at lea&s;t to advance my &s;elf</HI> by my own Merit and Indu&s;try; and that a Lawyer, like a Virgin, having once lo&s;t the Reputation of his Virtue or Sobriety, no body will meddle with him.<P>"I not only li&s;tned very attentively to my Father's Di&s;cour&s;e, but looking &s;teadily upon him, I thought I &s;aw more than u&s;ual Tender|ne&s;s and Affection in him all the while he was &s;peaking; <HI>whenever</HI> he mention'd his having omitted his Duty to his Family, I thought I &s;aw Tears &s;tanding in his Eyes, and to hear him &s;ay, he begg'd God's Pardon for the neglect of it, <HI>brought Tears into mine;</HI> when he told me he would make us all amends for the future, it &s;ug|ge&s;ted to my Mind, that my Father &s;uppo&s;ed that this want of more early in&s;tructing us, <HI>who are his Children,</HI> was <HI>our Lo&s;s</HI> as well as <HI>his Fault,</HI> and that we were not &s;uch Children as we &s;hould
<PB N="84" REF="89">
have been <HI>if we had been better taught.</HI> I mu&s;t own to you, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> the&s;e Thoughts have &s;ince made a great Di&s;turbance in my Mind; I thought I &s;aw the Two young Ladies at next Door, and their Brother too, look'd quite another Sort of People <HI>than we did;</HI> they appear <HI>&s;o</HI> mode&s;t, <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;ober, and yet <HI>&s;o</HI> decently and genteely affable and plea&s;ant, that I think they live quite another Lite than we do: <HI>They never</HI> &s;wear, nor u&s;e lewd and prophane Words in their Di&s;cour&s;e; <HI>they never</HI> &s;it up all Night at Cards, or go a Vi|&s;iting a <HI>Sundays,</HI> nor do a hundred fooli&s;h things that our Family makes a Trade of, <HI>and yet</HI> they live as merrily, comfortably, &s;ociably, and genteely as we do.</P>
<P>"<HI>I mu&s;t own to you,</HI> tho' I have often laugh'd at them, and ridicul'd them before, yet my Thoughts often told me they liv'd a more ratio|nal Life than we did; and when I heard my Fa|ther talk thus, it pre&s;ently came into my Thoughts, That if my Father took the new Cour&s;e with his Family <HI>as he talk'd of,</HI> we &s;hould begin to be like them, and I thought that would be very well for us all.</P>
<P>"Well, after my Father had gone on thus, and paus'd a while, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e to hear whether I would &s;ay any thing to it or no;</HI> I told him, I would be glad to do any thing to an&s;wer his End, and de|&s;ired to know what it was he expected of me: <HI>My Father &s;aid,</HI> The chief End of his Di&s;cour&s;e was then to convince me of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of an Alteration in my Life, and of the Advantages of a Religious Family, and of a &s;ober, religious Education, and for the re&s;t, if I was fir&s;t &s;atisfied of the general, he knew it would be ea&s;ie to bring me to comply with all the Mea&s;ures he &s;hould take to bring it about.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">
We had a great deal more &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e, but I told him I was very well &s;atisfied that he de&s;ign'd nothing but our Good, and I &s;hould be ready to ob|&s;erve all the Injunctions he &s;hould lay on me; and <HI>truly Si&s;ter,</HI> now I begin to reflect upon it, I find a great deal of Satisfaction in it; <HI>for, upon my Word,</HI> I think we have liv'd very odly all along, whether it were my Father's Fault or our own, I don't enquire; but if we knew no more, <HI>none of us;</HI> of the Town, than we do of Religion, we &s;hould be a very unfa&s;hionable Family.</P>

<HEAD>The Fifth DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t Dialogue is a kind of a <HI>Sketch</HI> or Draught of the whole Family we are &s;peaking of. The Elde&s;t <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Daughter,</HI> as their Father and Mother had &s;ugge&s;ted, being grown up in a long allow'd Cour&s;e of Loo&s;ne&s;s in Behaviour, all manner of Liberties having been given them; with|out any Family-Re&s;traint, <HI>without Government,</HI> and rather encourag'd by their Parents, <HI>than li|mited</HI> either by Example or Command, prov'd, <HI>as might well be expected,</HI> very ob&s;tinate and refracto|ry, <HI>e&s;pecially the Daughter,</HI> who being hot and in|&s;olent, her Mother, <HI>at the fir&s;t Attempt,</HI> was &s;o provok'd as to u&s;e her &s;omewhat roughly; The other Children, who were grown up, <HI>being al&s;o a Son and a Daughter,</HI> are not only brought to &s;ub|mit to the Reformation propo&s;ed by their Parents, but embrace it with Willingne&s;s and Chearfulne&s;s, and make their Duty be their Choice, to the great Satisfaction of their Parents.</P>
<P><HI>The following Dialogue</HI> is between the Father and Mother with their &s;aid <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> re&s;pe|ctively, <HI>and apart,</HI> which are the &s;ame that are referred to in the former Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105">
The Mother, it &s;eems began with her Elde&s;t Daughter upon &s;omething in her Behaviour about breaking the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and this by the Imprudence of the Daughter, ended rougher than &s;he [<HI>the Mo|ther</HI>] de&s;ign'd it.</P>
<P>The Father began with his <HI>Second Son,</HI> and find|ing him very tractable, proceeded to his Elde&s;t Son, but met with great Difficulties and Di&s;cou|ragements in him.</P>
<P>The Mother found the <HI>Second Daughter</HI> &s;en&s;ibly affected with her Di&s;cour&s;e, and chearfully willing to &s;ubmit to her In&s;tructions, which was a great Comfort to her, and encourag'd her to deal the better with her ob&s;tinate Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>Their other Children were younger, and rather to be govern'd by Authority than Per&s;wa&s;ion. The Dialogue with the Elde&s;t Daughter <HI>began thus:</HI> After Sermon, every Lord's Day, it had been their Cu&s;tom to walk abroad, or go to the Park, or a Vi&s;iting, <HI>and &s;o to wear off the Evening,</HI> and then come Home to Supper; but the Ca&s;e be|ing now alter'd, <HI>the Father</HI> had let the Servants know they mu&s;t all &s;tay at Home, and had told his Younger Son, with whom he had di&s;cour&s;ed in the Morning, that he would have no more going to the Park on the Lord's Day; but the Daughter had not yet heard of it, nor the Elde&s;t Son, <HI>or if they had,</HI> they did not believe their Father was in earne&s;t; &s;o that according to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, they were preparing to go abroad, and the <HI>Son</HI> had bid their Coachman get ready to carry them out; the Mother perceiving the Daughter to be putting on her Gloves, calls to her thus:</P>

<HEAD>The Sixth DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the Mother was <HI>thus</HI> managing her Daughters, the Father was as much engag'd with his <HI>Two Sons,</HI> and his Hard|&s;hips were <HI>every jot</HI> as great as the Mother's, and his Encouragements the &s;ame too.</P>
<P><HI>It is to be ob&s;erv'd here,</HI> that the Difficulty in this Part of Education of Children, does not lie &s;o much in the Que&s;tion what to teach them, and <HI>what Principles</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion to go upon, as to bring them by Rea&s;oning and Argu|ment to be <HI>teachable;</HI> to per&s;wade them that they have any Occa&s;ion to learn, or that any are ca|pable of teaching them, and to cau&s;e them <HI>to &s;ub|mit</HI> to In&s;truction in general.</P>
<P>The Father call'd his <HI>Second Son</HI> up to him on a Sabbath Day in the Morning, before he came down Stairs, and taking him into his Clo&s;et, be|gan this Dialogue with him: The Son you are to &s;uppo&s;e had been bred a Gentleman, and a Scholar, was about Seventeen Years of Age, and was newly come from the Univer&s;ity.</P>

<P>But, perhaps you do not know <HI>that not you only,</HI> but all the Family, <HI>my &s;elf not excepted,</HI> have never taken a due Notice of <HI>the Sabbath-day,</HI> or of the Manner in which we ought to behave on that Day: The Duty appointed for the Day has been too much neglected; above all, the great Duty of &s;etting it apart for the Wor&s;hip and Service of God, and keeping the <HI>Sabbath-day</HI> Holy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember <HI>the fourth Commandment,</HI> Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes,</HI> We can all repeat the Commandments by rote, and do every Day <HI>at Church</HI> &s;ay them over and over; but the little Regard we have &s;hown to them <HI>in the Week,</HI> is too plain a Proof of our thinking but little of what we &s;ay; for, <HI>God knows,</HI> in <HI>my Hou&s;e,</HI> there has been little Difference be|tween a <HI>Sabbath-day</HI> and <HI>another Day,</HI> unle&s;s it be, that the <HI>Sabbath-day</HI> has been &s;pent the wor&s;t of the two; for excepting our ju&s;t going to the <HI>Church,</HI> which al&s;o is made a meer Diver&s;ion, and <HI>a kind of</HI> Entertainment, <HI>all the re&s;t</HI> is &s;pent in meer revelling, fea&s;ting, vi&s;iting, and either riding abroad, or Mirth and Gayety at Home; and this is &s;o Notorious, <HI>more in my Family than in any other,</HI> that I am &s;en&s;ible it is <HI>high time</HI> to put a Stop to it, and I de&s;ign to tell you all my Mind this Evening, that the Reformation may be effectual: I hope none of my Children will oppo&s;e their own Good.</P>

<P>I hope not, Sir.</P>

<P>Nay, if they oppo&s;e me <HI>never &s;o much,</HI> I am re&s;olv'd of this; if they will be fooli&s;h and wicked, they &s;hall be <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> and <HI>wicked</HI> for them&s;elves, not

<HI>for me,</HI> or for any body el&s;e; <HI>for my part,</HI> when I look back upon my Family, and con&s;ider how we have liv'd hitherto, I wonder that the Judgments of God have not di&s;tingui&s;h'd <HI>my Family,</HI> and made us as publick, and as much the Amazement of the World for <HI>our Puni&s;hment,</HI> as we have been No|torious for <HI>our Sin;</HI> and therefore if it were only for the Fear of the Hand of Heaven, <HI>tho' I hope I act from another Principle too,</HI> I think it concerns me to &s;et about a Family Reformation with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence and Application.</P>

<P>Indeed I never con&s;ider'd it, Sir, <HI>till of late,</HI> but for &s;ome time pa&s;t I have begun to &s;ee, we have not been right: <HI>It is true,</HI> we do not live as other Families do, <HI>and I have often thought &s;o,</HI> but perhaps not with &s;o much Concern as I &s;hould have done.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t Steps, <HI>my dear,</HI> are the breaking off the ill Practices of our Family, and the regulating the Hou&s;e by the Rules of Virtue, Sobriety, and a Chri&s;tian Life, things we have all been Stran|gers to <HI>here.</HI></P>

<P><HI>This, Sir,</HI> is that which I told you before I had an Inclination to formerly, and 'tis with a great deal of Plea&s;ure I &s;hall clo&s;e with all your Schemes of that kind; becau&s;e it is &s;ome time ago &s;ince I have &s;een and ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>as I thought</HI> we did not live like Chri&s;tians, but rather like Heathens; and that other Families were quite an|other Sort of People than we; and I could not but be in love with them, and weary of ours: For <HI>I cannot but think,</HI> that Nature it &s;elf dictates <HI>to a Man of Sen&s;e,</HI> that a Life of Virtue and Sobriety is more agreeable to us, <HI>as Men,</HI> than a vicious, wicked, profligate Cour&s;e, which ever, <HI>not only</HI> ruins the E&s;tate, the Con&s;cience, the Health, and the good Name of the Per&s;on, but even his Repu|tation <HI>as to the World</HI> al&s;o.</P>

<P>Why really, <HI>Madam,</HI> they are concern'd on &s;everal Accounts, to &s;ee &s;uch a Breach in the Family; to &s;ee my Ma&s;ter &s;o griev'd at it, and yet to &s;ee him &s;o re&s;olute again&s;t you, that they &s;ee plainly it will be the Ruin of you both, and then to think upon how unju&s;tifiable a Ground you act; pray pardon me, Madam, it is not fit I &s;hould talk thus.</P>

<P>Go on, <HI>Pru.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Madam;</HI> was it ever known that a young Gentleman, and a young Lady, the Elde&s;t Branches of the Family, &s;hould break all to pieces with their Father, <HI>and &s;uch a Father too,</HI> and on no Quarrel, but that he would have them reform, and &s;erve God! What will the World &s;ay? I be|&s;eech you Madam con&s;ider of it, all the Hou&s;e condemn you now, and all the World will con|demn you as &s;oon as you are gone.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well <HI>Pru,</HI> but we are not gone yet.</P>

<P>I am afraid of it.</P>

<P>Why &s;o, <HI>Pru?</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e that belongs to the latter Part of my Father's Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Madam.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell us that too, <HI>Pru.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why,</HI> that is it which gives me the great|e&s;t Concern for you, <HI>Madam,</HI> that when my Ma|&s;ter had prayed &s;o earne&s;tly and &s;o affectionately for your reclaiming and returning to your Duty, <HI>he went on to pray for him&s;elf,</HI> that he might not be &s;uffered to yield to your Ob&s;tinacy; that his Af|fection might not prevail over his Duty; that if God in Judgment had re&s;olv'd totally to ca&s;t you off, he might be able to do &s;o too; and that in the
<PB N="162" REF="167">
mean time he might be &s;upported in maintaining his Re&s;olution of not receiving you again but as Penitents, and on good A&s;&s;urance of your Refor|mation as well as Repentance; and this, Madam, made me &s;o earne&s;t with you; I think I &s;hall break my Heart for you.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>The Maid weeps.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prethee don't grieve, <HI>Pru,</HI> but tell us what is to be done then: What did you mean by talking of our coming in? I don't &s;ee what we have done, that we mu&s;t repent &s;o much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why no, Madam, I hope not, if you will but be prevail'd on now, and that made me &s;ay there was one <HI>STEP</HI> left to &s;ave you &s;till.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd you &s;aid &s;o, <HI>Pru;</HI> prethee good <HI>Pru,</HI> What <HI>Step</HI> is that? I did not think Things were come to &s;uch an Extremity with my Father.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>She &s;eems to be concern'd, and let's fall &s;ome Tears.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Madam,</HI> all this, and more that I have not told you, is upon a firm Belief which both your Father and Mother have, that you are <HI>both</HI> gone to the Park, as you know you bade me &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now Madam, if you will give me leave to go in, and &s;ay you are both of you here, and have been no farther, perhaps this will alter the Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not know my Father, <HI>Pru,</HI> he is not &s;o &s;oon alter'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, Madam, you may not know him neither <HI>in this Ca&s;e:</HI> Do you think if he reckons your Di&s;obedience or Fault &s;o much his Affliction, he will not be glad to hear that you have not been guilty?</P>
</SP>

<P>Guilty of what, <HI>Pru?</HI> What is the Fault?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="163" REF="168">
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, my Ma&s;ter believes, that in Defiance of his Command, and God's Command, and on purpo&s;e to let him &s;ee you re&s;olve not to regard what he has &s;aid to you, <HI>you are both gone to the Park,</HI> to take your Plea&s;ure now on the Sab|bath-Day; and on this Suppo&s;ition he has comman|ded, when you come back, <HI>none of the Servants</HI> &s;hall dare let you in till they call him, and that though he be gone to Bed, he will be call'd up.</P>

<P>Now, Madam, here is a few Minutes left; my Ma&s;ter may be convinc'd you have not been any farther than this Place, and you may come in the &s;ame Way you went out, and I dare &s;ay my Ma&s;ter will be glad of &s;o ju&s;t an Occa&s;ion not to be &s;evere with you; try him, <HI>Madam, dear Madam,</HI> for your own &s;ake do, <HI>you are quite undone</HI> I am &s;ure, if you do not.</P>

<P>I &s;hall be a Witne&s;s for you, Madam; be&s;ides <HI>your Brother there</HI> is in his Gown and Slip|pers, and that will prove he cannot have been at the Park.</P>

<SP>

<P>Ay, ay, he cannot but be &s;atisfied, <HI>go</HI> Pru, <HI>let it be &s;o,</HI> we will follow you; I would not pu&s;h things too far neither, <HI>Si&s;ter.</HI></P>

<P>Becau&s;e it &s;eems to an&s;wer no End, or at lea&s;t, that I know of.</P>

<P>Perhaps you was willing to try me with a Belief of your being gone to the Park, contrary to

my expre&s;s Command; I am not fond of being play'd with in &s;uch things as the&s;e.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I complied when I di&s;puted the Ju|&s;tice of the Command, it would more unan&s;we|rably argue an entire Obedience to it <HI>as your Com|mand only.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had rather you had obey'd it <HI>as God's Com|mand,</HI> than as mine, and then you would no more have &s;pent your time <HI>here,</HI> than at the Park.</P>

<P>But if it be the fir&s;t <HI>Sir,</HI> your pre&s;ent Di&s;|plea&s;ure will remove, if it was rai&s;ed upon a Sup|po&s;ition of our having been at the Park.</P>

<P>But what &s;hall we do with <HI>your Son?</HI> For I have a &s;ecret Hint given me to Day, that he de&s;igns to ask me leave to travel, and pretends that I promi&s;ed him.</P>

<P>I &s;hall be more willing to let him go now <HI>than ever,</HI> becau&s;e as I would have no Ob&s;truction to the Re&s;olution I have taken to reform my Fa|mily, &s;o I would be very &s;orry to &s;ee him expo&s;e his Reputation &s;o much as to contradict me in it, <HI>and appear ob&s;tinate in doing &s;o,</HI> which mu&s;t em|broil me with him, for I &s;hall not yield to my Son, e&s;pecially where I am &s;ure he is in the wrong; and indeed, his Carriage hitherto has been a very great Affliction to me; if he proves impertinent, I &s;hall be oblig'd to re&s;ent it: Therefore I &s;hall only put in one Condition, if he asks me, <HI>(viz.)</HI>

<HEAD>The INTROD&V;CTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fir&s;t Part having hi&s;torically treated of a Father's Conduct with his Hou&s;hold, the Foundation of his Re|&s;olution to reform his Family, in&s;truct his Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I hope it may af|ford &s;uitable Le&s;&s;ons to Fathers, Mothers, Ma&s;ters of Families, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in their Duty of Family-In&s;tru|ction; as al&s;o Examples, and &s;uitable Hints to Children, to warn them again&s;t de&s;pi&s;ing and con|temning the In&s;truction of their Parents, from the Con&s;equences on either Side, which appear in the foregoing Hi&s;tory of this unhappy, yet happy Family.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing Part will go the &s;ame Length in the following Ca&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) Ma&s;ters to Servants. (2) Servants to Ma&s;ters, and to Fellow-Servants. (3) Companions and Sociates one to another; from all which may be learnt &s;ome Le&s;&s;ons to in&s;truct us how to fill up every Relation, every Occa&s;ion, every Circum&s;tance of Life, and every Conver&s;ation, with &s;omething u&s;eful and in&s;tru|cting to one another.</P>
<P>The Scene lies now among the meaner Sort of People, where the Value of a Religious Family, the Extent of its Influence, and the Advantage of good <HI>Family-Government,</HI> as well to tho&s;e who are
<PB N="174" REF="179">
out, as to tho&s;e who are in the Family, may be particularly ob&s;erv'd from the remarkable Conduct of &s;ome Per&s;ons belonging to Two or Three Fa|milies in a certain known Country-Corporation at &s;ome Di&s;tance from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THERE liv'd in a Country Town, an indu|&s;trious Trading Man, in middling Circum|&s;tances, who&s;e Employment being a Clothier, caus'd him to take &s;everal Apprentices, and &s;eve|ral Journey-men; and who had al&s;o &s;everal Chil|dren of his own: He was a Man of an exact up|right Conver&s;ation, of a mo&s;t devout and religious Behaviour, but more e&s;pecially in his Family; one that con&s;tantly maintain'd the Exerci&s;e of Religious Wor&s;hip in his Hou&s;e, in&s;tructing and educating his Children and Servants in the Fear and Knowledge of God, with great Care and Re|gard, <HI>as well</HI> to their Good, <HI>as</HI> to his own Duty; and this with all po&s;&s;ible Mode&s;ty and Caution; avoiding all hypocritical Shews and Appearances of O&s;tentation, being a &s;erious u&s;eful Chri&s;tian in every Re&s;pect, and his Wife was in her Place every way like him.</P>
<P>There was in the &s;ame Town a wealthy Shop|keeper, a Man in great Bu&s;ine&s;s, a Magi&s;trate or Alderman of the Corporation, who had likewi&s;e a large Family of Children and Servants: The Man was bred to bu&s;ine&s;s, drove a great Trade, and grew Rich apace; he was an hone&s;t &s;ober Man, had the Reputation of a very fair Dealer, the Credit of what we call a good Man, that would do no body any Wrong; but as to Reli|gion, he made no great Stir about that, he &s;erved God <HI>a Sundays</HI> as other People did, and troubled his Head very little with any thing that was Religious all the Week after; indeed, he liv'd in
<PB N="175" REF="180">
a con&s;tant hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o that he had really no time to think of, or to &s;pare about Religious Affairs.</P>
<P>His Children, as they grew up, he put hone&s;tly to School, enquir'd &s;ometimes &s;uperficially if they were good Boys, and learn'd their Books, and the Ma&s;ter as &s;uperficially giving an An&s;wer that they did pretty well, he was mighty ea&s;ie as to their doing well in the World.</P>
<P>As to his Servants, it was none of his Care in the lea&s;t what they did, &s;o they minded his Bu&s;ine&s;s; as to Idlene&s;s, he took pretty good Care to prevent that, by finding them con&s;tant Employment in his Ware hou&s;es, and about his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and as to either their Morals or Reli|gion, he counted it none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, except at any time &s;ome gro&s;s Indecency came in his Way, which oblig'd him to find Fault, and then his Di&s;plea&s;ure re&s;pected the Neglect or Ob&s;tru|ction of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;ome Complaints or Un|ea&s;ine&s;s in the Neighbourhood, rather than any thing of Religion.</P>
<P>It appears by the Story in hand, that two young Lads, much about the &s;ame Age, and pretty near the &s;ame time, came Apprentices to the&s;e Two Men; The Youths were very different in their Behaviour, tho' otherwi&s;e agreeable to one ano|ther, their Conduct was, <HI>as in &s;uch Ca&s;es it will be,</HI> &s;uitable to the Families of their Parents, with whom they had been Educated; <HI>the one</HI> a &s;ober, well inclin'd, &s;erious Lad, that had been brought up by Religious Parents, well in&s;tructed, and formed early to de&s;ire the be&s;t things; <HI>the other</HI> a loo&s;e, profligate, prophane Boy, perfectly wild, that had been taught nothing, and de&s;ir'd to learn nothing <HI>but his Trade,</HI> given to &s;wearing, lying, and ill Words, but of a good Capacity
<PB N="176" REF="181">
enough to learn, if he had been taught in time, &s;o that he was meerly lo&s;t for want of early In|&s;truction.</P>
<P>The &s;ober religious Lad was unhappily put Ap|prentice to the Rich Shop-keeper, who regarded no Religion but his Trade; and the wild pro|phane Boy was put Apprentice to the Religious Trade&s;man the Clothier, and being Neighbours, the Boys became acquainted it &s;eems: Altho' there was very little Suitablene&s;s between the manner of the young Men's Education, yet their Age, Neighbourhood, and Opportunity of Conver&s;a|tion concurring, and other Circum&s;tances per|haps in their Temper, or in the time of their coming to their Ma&s;ters, making them more a|greeable to one another than ordinary, they be|came Companions, and contracted an intimate Friend&s;hip, the Con&s;equence of which will ap|pear in the following Dialogues.</P>

<HEAD>The Fir&s;t DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="dialogue">
<P>AFTER, as is noted, the Two Youths had contracted an Intimacy, &s;o that it was grown up to a kind of Affection between them, they agreed in the fir&s;t Place to call Brothers, <HI>and then,</HI> that every Evening when their Shops were &s;hut up, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s over, they would &s;pend any Time they had to &s;pare, always together, either at their Ma&s;ters Doors, or walking, or as their Liberty would permit; and, <HI>as may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be pretty u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es,</HI> it was not the la&s;t of the Que&s;tions they asked one another at the&s;e Meetings, how they lik'd their Ma&s;ters, their Employments, their U&s;age, <HI>and the like:</HI> In the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es it fell out they wanted no Grievances to complain of on both Sides; for that neither of them, tho' they had both gone &s;o far as to be bound, lik'd their Circum&s;tances; but it &s;eem'd, that the greate&s;t of their Di&s;like was at their Ma|&s;ters, and the re&s;pective Management of their Families, rather than at any thing in the Trades they carried on, which they otherwi&s;e lik'd well enough.</P>
<P>Says <HI>Will,</HI> who liv'd with the good Clothier, I'll tell you plainly, Brother <HI>Tom,</HI> I am quite
<PB N="178" REF="183">
tir'd out with my Ma&s;ter, I can't imagine what my Father meant when he pick'd out &s;uch a Man for me; I'm &s;ure my Father is none of tho&s;e kind of People him&s;elf; Why, our Hou&s;e is a Mona|&s;tery in&s;tead of a Shop, or a Work hou&s;e.</P>
<P>A Mona&s;tery, <HI>Will!</HI> &s;ays the other, what <HI>do you mean by that?</HI> Don't we hear your People and your Servants about their Bu&s;ine&s;s every Day; they don't dre&s;s Cloth, and comb Wool in the Mona&s;teries.</P>
<P><HI>Why no, Brother,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Will,</HI> it is not a Mona|&s;tery &s;o, I don't mean <HI>that,</HI> but we have &s;uch a World of Ceremonies, and Religious Doings a|mong us, 'tis enough to weary a Body off their Legs; I'm &s;ure I &s;hall never endure it long.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you are &s;ooner tired with the&s;e Religious Doings, Brother, that you &s;peak of, than you would be with other things: Is not that it, Brother <HI>Will?</HI> &s;peak hone&s;tly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I do not know much about it, I confe&s;s; it don't &s;ignifie much, I &s;uppo&s;e, but to torment us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do you mind it much, I &s;uppo&s;e, when you are at it, <HI>Brother,</HI> do ye?</P>

<P>No indeed, not I; I take care to get a good Sleep all the while, if I can.</P>

<P>Fie upon you, <HI>Will.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, what does it &s;ignifie to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>What their Prayers, <HI>Brother?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, their Prayers; why they pray for them&s;elves, not for me, do they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt they pray for you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I don't care whether they do or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay there I think you are wrong, <HI>Brother Will;</HI> &s;hould we not be glad to have any body pray for us? I remember, at Church there are Bills &s;ent in, for the Mini&s;ter to pray for Folks;
<PB N="179" REF="184">
they would not put up Bills to be pray'd for, if it was of no Signification.</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay,</HI> that's when they are &s;ick, <HI>Brother,</HI> but what's that to me, I am well enough, and it is but when they de&s;ire it, now I never de&s;ir'd them to pray for me; what need they trouble their Heads about me in their Prayers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> but <HI>Brother,</HI> you &s;ay they pray for them&s;elves, why &s;hould you be again&s;t that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I; but then they may do it by them|&s;elves, <HI>can't they?</HI> What need they keep us up at Night, and rai&s;e us up in the Morning? Can't they let us alone, we work hard enough all Day, they ought to let us &s;leep at Night, &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, do they take up &s;o long Time at it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay,</HI> I think it is long <HI>for us that work hard at our Bu&s;ine&s;s all Day,</HI> here we are haul'd out of our Beds every Morning by Six a Clock to come to Prayers, before we open the Shop, or go into the Work-hou&s;e, <HI>and at Night</HI> we are kept up, I know not how long, to read, and go to Prayers, when we might be all a bed and a&s;leep; I tell you 'tis a meer Mona&s;tery, I can|not endure it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> but <HI>Brother,</HI> I remember one thing by the By, it &s;eems this can't be much Trouble to you; for you acknowledge you &s;leep all the while if you can; &s;o that you do not lo&s;e much of your Re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, that's true,</HI> but that can't be always; be&s;ides every now and then they catch me at it, and then there is &s;uch a Noi&s;e with them&mdash;Then there's our Ma&s;ter's Son, he is &s;uch a Reli|gious Monkey, he is always a jogging a Body, that I can't get a good &s;leep for him; but this is not all, <HI>Brother,</HI> we have abundance of &s;trange Doings of this kind, be&s;ides going to Prayers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="180" REF="185">
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hark you, <HI>Brother Will,</HI> about calling you up in a Morning, let me hear that again; you &s;ay your Ma&s;ter calls you up by Six a Clock in the Morning to come to Prayers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and that is, I &s;ay, ju&s;t as they do in the Mona&s;teries: <HI>I know 'tis &s;o,</HI> for I had a Cou&s;in that was a Nun, and made her E&s;cape out of a Nunnery, and &s;he is turn'd Prote&s;tant, and &s;he u&s;ed to tell me they were obliged to ri&s;e at &s;uch Hours in the Night to go to Prayers, I wonder my Ma&s;ter don't do &s;o too; I don't que&s;tion but in a little time he will, and we &s;hall be all Monks in&s;tead of Clothiers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Brother Will,</HI> you mu&s;t do your Ma&s;ter Ju&s;tice now; for, if I mi&s;take not, you wrong him very much by your own Account, <HI>as I was going to &s;ay.</HI></P>

<P>How <HI>Brother?</HI> I don't wrong him at all.</P>

<P><HI>Why,</HI> you &s;uppo&s;e of him he takes the Time he &s;pends in tho&s;e Religious Things out of your Sleep, or out of the Time when you ought to be in Bed, and you think that an Injury to you, becau&s;e you work hard; pray what time do your hir'd Journey men come to work in a Morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>At Six a Clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> and do they actually go to work by Six a Clock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, why not,</HI> is not that the u&s;ual time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes <HI>Brother,</HI> but then you &s;ay your Ma|&s;ter does not call you up till Six, and then he goes to Prayers; now if he did not go to Pray|ers, he would go to work, and you could not expect but to be at Work, who are his Appren|tices, as well as the Journey-men; &s;o that the Time he &s;pends at Prayer, he takes out of your Working Time, and not out of your Sleeping
<PB N="181" REF="186">
Time, and the Lo&s;s is his own, not yours; I think there you do your Ma&s;ter wrong, <HI>Brother.</HI></P>

<P>Our Hou&s;e, <HI>Will!</HI> No indeed we are not troubled with it, I never heard a Chapter read, or a Word &s;poke of Prayer &s;ince I came into the Hou&s;e, and that's as much my Unea&s;ine&s;s, as this is yours.</P>

<P>Yes, I learnt to read in it at School.</P>

<P>Was that all? Did you never read at Home? What, have you never a Bible in the Hou&s;e?</P>

<P>Yes, we have a great Bible in the Parlour Window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What, and does no body u&s;e it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Mother reads in it &s;ometimes, and my Father &s;ets down how old his Children are, in it; there's the Time when we were all Born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But were you never us'd to be bid to read in it by your Father or Mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Mother would &s;ometimes call me from Play, to come and read my Book; but I would not come, I lov'd my Play too well for that.</P>

<P>Why there you would have read, <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that &s;ets Light by his Father or Mother,</HI> Deut. 27. 16. Be&s;ides, <HI>Will,</HI> cannot you &s;ay the Ten Commandments?</P>

<P>Well, and don't you remember the Fifth Commandment, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what's that to my going to Play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it was &s;omething to your refu&s;ing to come and read your Book when your Mother call'd you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ignified that? I knew my Mother was not angry, &s;he did not much trouble her Head whether I came in to read or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>So indeed it is plain as you &s;aid, that nei|ther your Father or your Mother troubled their Heads about you, whether you &s;erved God or no! I do not wonder that you think it &s;o trouble&s;ome that your Ma&s;ter goes to Prayers, and &s;erves God in his Family; I wonder how you, that have been bred &s;o wickedly, came to be put out to &s;o reli|gious a Family as your Ma&s;ter is!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I heard my Father &s;ay once, before I came to my Ma&s;ter, that he was the willinger to put me to him, becau&s;e he was a good Man, and I might learn good Things there, for I had never learnt any at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that your Father owns then, <HI>Will,</HI> that the&s;e are good Things, tho' he does not practi&s;e them him&s;elf, that is very &s;trange, <HI>Will!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, yes,</HI> My Father us'd to &s;ay he lov'd my Ma&s;ter, becau&s;e he was a good Man, and that he was a Man kept good Orders in his Family; and one Day he told me, that if I was a good Boy, and follow'd my Ma&s;ter's Advice, I &s;hould be made a good Man, better than ever my Father was, and that my Ma&s;ter went to Prayers, and &s;erved God, and &s;uch as that, but I knew nothing what he meant; if I had known how it was, I &s;hould never have come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="188" REF="193">
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you own, that tho' your Father did not call you to Prayer him&s;elf, he lik'd your Ma&s;ter the better becau&s;e he did, why &s;hould not you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, I lov'd to live as I had been bred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you &s;ee your Father own'd that your Ma&s;ter was a better Chri&s;tian than him&s;elf, and that the Orders he kept in his Family, was the way to make you a good Man, nay, to make you better than your Father too; methinks you &s;hould be|lieve your Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know as to that, but I don't like it, not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are then not for being made a good Man, or el&s;e you don't believe your Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't &s;ee how he'll make me any better than I am; I tell you I don't like it at all, I dare &s;ay you would not like it neither.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I not! I wi&s;h I was to be try'd, <HI>Will.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you were, I am &s;ure you would be &s;ick of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now, Brother <HI>Will,</HI> that cannot be, for my Grievance is ju&s;t the contrary to yours, for I have been the unea&s;ie&s;t Boy alive; I have got a Ma&s;ter that lives exactly like your Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Father! Alas my Father is but an or|dinary Man, your Ma&s;ter is an Alderman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean as to Religion, <HI>Will;</HI> 'tis true, my Ma&s;ter goes to the Meeting-hou&s;e, and my Mi&s;tre&s;s goes to Church, and they &s;erve God there after their Way, and we have nothing of Swearing, Cur&s;ing, or Drunkenne&s;s in the Hou&s;e, or &s;uch as that, I mu&s;t do them that Ju&s;tice; but as to Religion, I never heard a Word of it in the Hou&s;e &s;ince I came to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="189" REF="194">
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well now,</HI> and yet every body &s;ays your Ma&s;ter is a very good Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, <HI>Brother,</HI> you &s;ee you were mi&s;taken before, when you fancied a Man could not be a good Man without making &s;uch a Pother about his Praying and his Religion, as my Ma&s;ter does; I do not &s;ee that my Ma&s;ter is a jot better Man than yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, <HI>Will,</HI> it was not I was mi&s;taken, it was your own Father was mi&s;taken, who you acknowledge, told you, <HI>he loved your Ma&s;ter be|cau&s;e he was a good Man,</HI> and <HI>that you might learn good Things there, and that if you followed your Ma&s;ter's Advice you would be a good Man too, and a better Man than your Father;</HI> he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken in all that, <HI>Will.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I a'n't talking of my Father, they may be any of them better than my Father, he knows that him&s;elf; but I &s;peak of your Ma|&s;ter, every Body &s;ays he is <HI>a good Man,</HI> and <HI>a religious Man,</HI> and he has the be&s;t Reputation in the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, Will,</HI> he is an hone&s;t Man, a very fair Man, he does no body any Wrong, but I have never been bred that Way in my Life; I have never heard any &s;uch thing as Praying to God, or reading the Scriptures in the Hou&s;e &s;ince I came hither, and yet when I came to him I was told he was a mighty Religious Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, that's what I &s;ay,</HI> he is counted a re|ligious Man, and they &s;ay he goes to the <HI>Meeting|hou&s;es</HI> too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the wor&s;e for him if he appear religious only, and his Practice makes him appear to be otherwi&s;e; however, I will not &s;ay what he is privately, but this I am &s;ure of, it does not ap|pear
<PB N="190" REF="195">
in his Family, we that are Servants &s;ee no|thing of it, nor his Children either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why,</HI> that is as I would have it be at our Hou&s;e; he is a very good Man, every body &s;ays &s;o, and what need he trouble you with it? I don't like this making &s;uch a Show of Religion; can't they be Religious, but they mu&s;t trouble all the Family with it? I believe your Ma&s;ter is a very hone&s;t good Man, <HI>Tom,</HI> tho' he makes no Show of it, as mine does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk prophanely again, <HI>Will, I am no more for making a Show of Religion than you,</HI> but <HI>if there be no Religion where there is &s;ome Show of it, to be &s;ure there is no Religion where there is</HI> no Show <HI>at all of it;</HI> but what do you call <HI>Show?</HI> Is it not every Chri&s;tian Man's Duty to teach his Hou|&s;hold and Family to &s;erve God? Do you call that a Show? Every one ought to make &s;uch a Show of Religion, and if he does not, he plainly makes a Show of having very little Religion him&s;elf: I might give you a great many Places out of Scripture for this, but it &s;eems you han't read much out of the Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what would you have your Ma&s;ter do? You would not have him make &s;uch a Rout as my Ma&s;ter does, would you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have him &s;erve God in his Family, as other religious good People do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you &s;ay they all &s;erve God a <HI>Sundays.</HI></P>

<P>What's that to his Family? We may run about where we will for all him, <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> or any Day or Night, he never takes any Thought for us, we are but in the Counting-hou&s;e next Morning, <HI>when he wants us,</HI> we may &s;erve God or the Devil, it's all one to him.</P>

<P><HI>Truly,</HI> I have no manner of Convenience for that neither, for we all lie together in a Room, and at fir&s;t I us'd to kneel down and pray by my &s;elf, but the re&s;t of the Apprentices jeer'd me out of it, and made &s;uch a Noi&s;e at me, I was forc'd to leave it off, and now I go to Bed and ri&s;e like a Bea&s;t, as they do; but it grieves me &s;o, I can|not tell what to do, for I am &s;ure it is a Sin to do &s;o, and I am afraid God &s;hould &s;how &s;ome Judg|ment upon me for it.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, is there any Danger of that <HI>Tom!</HI> why, I never prayed to God in my Life.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I han't left off praying neither; for if my Ma&s;ter does but &s;end me of an Errand, I pray as I go along the Streets; and &s;ometimes I get up into the Hay-loft over the Stable, or any where that I can be private; but this is &s;o &s;eldom,
<PB N="192" REF="197">
and it grieves me &s;o, that when I come to pray, I can do nothing but cry, I can't &s;peak a Word hardly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not under&s;tand the&s;e Things; &s;ure I am a &s;trange Creature! Why, it never troubles me; I don't know what 'tis to pray to God, I ne|ver knew there was any harm in not doing it; I wi&s;h I could learn, I'd &s;ay my Prayers too.</P>

<P>Why, if what you learnt is good, what need you forget it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'll tell you, <HI>Will,</HI> when I was at Home, and had all the Encouragement in the World by the Example and In&s;truction of my Father, and the Exhortation of my Mother, tel|ling me my Duty, and &s;trictly charging me never to lie down or ri&s;e without praying to God, in the Evening for Protection, in the Morning for Direction; yet I found a wicked Inclination with|in me, often prompting me to omit my Duty, <HI>and now</HI> when I want the&s;e Helps of Example and In|&s;truction, and in&s;tead of them have had &s;o many Di&s;couragements, and find it &s;o difficult to get a retir'd Place for it, I find that wicked Inclination to omit my Duty, encrea&s;es, and &s;ometimes I am for per&s;wading my &s;elf I have a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e to leave it quite off, and I am afraid &s;ome time or other I &s;hall do &s;o, and &s;o grow an Athei&s;t, and then I &s;hall live without God, <HI>like a Heathen,</HI> ju&s;t as you do, <HI>Will.</HI></P>

<P>I remember I ask'd my Father that very Que&s;tion, and he an&s;wer'd me thus; Do you not come to me, Child, when you want Cloaths, and ask me for them; and to your Mother when you are hungry, and ask for Victuals; and do you not do this without teaching?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did you &s;ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could I &s;ay? I kneel'd down every Night and Morning, and &s;aid over the Lord's Prayer, then I got a good Prayer out of a Book, and &s;aid that, and &s;ometimes a Word or two would come into my Thoughts, that I would &s;ay of my own Head, as I thought of &s;uch Things as were proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall never learn! why, I can hardly &s;ay over the Lord's Prayer without Book!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, <HI>Will,</HI> if I thought you were in earne&s;t, I would do my Endeavour to teach you; but you that have led &s;uch a wicked Life, and cry out of your Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;o much about Praying, I don't think you mean any thing but to je&s;t with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I do not je&s;t now; you &s;ay it is &s;o wicked a Thing, and I am in &s;uch a dangerous Condition, that you look'd for the Ground to open and &s;wallow me up; why, you can't think I would be willing to have the Devil take me away, <HI>what ever I may &s;ay &s;ometimes;</HI> but I am a poor ignorant Boy, how &s;hall I know what to do?</P>

<PB N="195" REF="200">
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>Will,</HI> and I al&s;o am but ignorant as I &s;aid before, and unfit to teach you, I am but a Boy, you know, <HI>but this I know, and have been taught,</HI> that God has made me; do you believe that, <HI>Will?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will,</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;ure!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if God made you, then he can de&s;troy you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is plain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then &s;ure, 'tis your Intere&s;t to &s;erve God, as well in Thankfulne&s;s to him becau&s;e he made you, as that he may not be provoked to de&s;troy you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is this &s;erving God? I thought it was nothing but going to Church a <HI>Sundays.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>To be &s;ure wor&s;hipping God at Church is good, and our Duty, but we mu&s;t wor&s;hip God other ways than at Church.</P>

<P>What, by &s;aying our Prayers?</P>

<P>Nay, that is not all neither; we mu&s;t fear God, and keep his Commandments.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;hall I do all that? You know that I know nothing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why therefore, <HI>Will,</HI> your fir&s;t thing as, the fir&s;t Thing my Father told me I was to do, was, to pray to God to teach me to know him, and to fear him, and to keep his Commandments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I know what his Commandments are? I can &s;ay the Ten Commandments, but I don't under&s;tand what they mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Father next directed me to read the Bible, which is the Word of God, and is given for our In&s;truction, that we may know his Will.</P>

<P>And will that teach me to know what to do?</P>

<P>I begin to be afraid indeed, it may be God won't hear me now, if I &s;hould Pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there's a Scripture for that to encou|rage you; <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy,</HI> I&s;aiah 55. 7.</P>

<P>Is that in the Bible?</P>

<P>Yes, and a great many more encouraging Things; You mu&s;t read the Scripture diligently: Have you never a Bible?</P>

<P>No, <HI>not I,</HI> nor never had in my Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not capable to direct you, <HI>Will;</HI> but I will tell you there are two Things which I would have you do, pray to God to forgive your Sins, and to teach you his Will, and read the Bible di|ligently, I'll give you a Bible, <HI>Will.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Brother <HI>Tom,</HI> if you will give me a Bible, I'll read it <HI>over</HI> and <HI>over,</HI> you &s;ay that will teach me; <HI>I'll read it,</HI> and thank you for it heartily, for I never had a Bible to read in yet.</P>

<P>But remember, <HI>Will, I &s;aid you</HI> mu&s;t pray to God to teach you when you read; to open your Under&s;tanding, that you may under&s;tand the Scriptures; and to teach you that you may know your Duty; and then pray to God to guide you in the doing his Will, and your Duty, according to the Scripture, which is his own Word.</P>

<P>What will my praying to God &s;ignifie? Will God do this for me, if I pray to him? And how can I pray! I don't know what Praying is, <HI>not I,</HI> what mu&s;t I &s;ay?</P>

<HEAD><HI>Notes</HI> on the Fir&s;t Dialogue.</HEAD>
<P>THO' this Dialogue, and indeed, this whole Part of the Book, is more a Hi&s;tory than the re&s;t, and that the Families which it points at, if they happen to &s;ee it, may be able to &s;ee them|&s;elves in it, and to make &s;ome U&s;e of it to their own Advantage, if they plea&s;e: Yet as even this Hi&s;tory will be the &s;ame thing as a Parable to the Ages to come, in which it may, I hope, be as u&s;eful now; and, <HI>above all,</HI> as this Work is de|&s;ign'd for a general, not a particular Reproof, I am willing to let it lie hid entirely <HI>as to Per&s;ons,</HI> that it may, perhaps, look le&s;s by that means like a Hi&s;tory, than really it is.</P>
<P>If the Per&s;ons whom it more really concerns, may &s;ee them&s;elves reproved, they will make not the le&s;s profitable U&s;e of it, for the Civility &s;hown them in concealing their Names; if they do not
<PB N="203" REF="208">
the Author can never want Opportunity to expo&s;e the Folly, <HI>if he &s;ees Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But the De&s;ign of this Book is of a Nature above a Per&s;onal Satyr; the Errors in Family-Conduct|are the Bu&s;ine&s;s here, not the Families them&s;elves; and the Names and Per&s;ons are &s;o entirely con|ceal'd, and the real H&s;tory &s;o couch'd, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any body, but the Per&s;ons them|&s;elves, to read the People by the Characters.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing reproved here, and worth ob|&s;erving, is a good Man, who had carefully educa|ted and in&s;tructed his Child, and who <HI>he might ea&s;ily &s;ee,</HI> was a &s;ober, well inclin'd <HI>Youth,</HI> knowing in good Things, and de&s;irous of them; yet had this Religious Parent forgotten him&s;elf, and &s;o far forgotten the Good of his Child al&s;o, as to place him out with a Ma&s;ter who had either no Reli|gion at all, <HI>or, which was all one to the Child,</HI> exerci&s;ed none of it in his Family; nor took any Care, or had any Concern for the Souls of his Servants, whatever he had for their Bodies.</P>
<P>The Child laments this very pathetically, tho' in a familiar way, to his Comrade; he is at fir&s;t weary of the prophane way of living, and then ju&s;tly afraid that the Interruptions he meets with to his Duty, &s;hould bring him to an Indifference about it, and to believe the Difficulties he found in his way, were ju&s;t Excu&s;es for him in omitting it totally at la&s;t.</P>
<P>NOTE, We have natural Hindrances enough in the way of our Duty, from the Aver&s;ions of a corrupt Nature, &s;o that at the be&s;t we &s;hall be ofren backward in, and prompted to, the Omi&s;&s;ion of Religious Performances; we have therefore great Need to remove all oc|ca&s;ional
<PB N="204" REF="209">
Ob&s;tructions, le&s;t Natural Inclina|tion &s;hould plead tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions as a ju&s;t Rea&s;on for a total Neglect of Duty.</P>
<P>It was not without a ju&s;t Rea&s;on that the poor Child entertain'd a Jealou&s;ie of him&s;elf, le&s;t he &s;hould grow cold in Religious Matters, from the general Di&s;couragement he met with in a Family where all Religious Duties were totally neglected, and him&s;elf made a Je&s;t for attempting to do his Duty.</P>
<P>This may be a &s;ea&s;onable Caution for &s;uch Pa|rents who have any Concern for the Souls of their Children, and have taken any Pains with them in their Education.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Not to think their Duty di&s;charg'd to them in the due in&s;tructing and educating them in their Infancy, the In&s;pection of a Parent does not end there, but they ought,</ITEM>

<P>It is very &s;trange, <HI>but too common,</HI> that religious Parents, who have taken great Care with their Children, when they were at home, wholly ne|glect this, and throw their Children away, by placing them where the Duties of Religion are not at all regarded; and where the Examples of their Ma&s;ters, and the Families they live in, quite rai&s;e all the Remembrance of former In&s;truction out of the Mind of the Servant, and they grow hard|ned
<PB N="205" REF="210">
in that Neglect by the Authority of their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>It is remarkable here farther,</HI> how the Duty of Servants is entirely neglected, even in tho&s;e Fami|lies where they do regard Religion, and where in&s;tructing of Children is taken care of; as if the Souls of Servants were not under the In&s;pection of the Ma&s;ter of a Family, and were none of his Charge, as well as the Souls of his Children.</P>
<P>NOTE, Apprentices taken into our Hou&s;es, ought, as far as it re&s;pects their Souls, to be reckon'd as Children; for as we take them from the Tuition of their Parents, if we act not the Parent to them as well as the Ma&s;ter, we may teach them their Trade, but we breed them up for the Devil.</P>
<P>It cannot be omitted here to ob&s;erve what Im|pre&s;&s;ions of Religion; what Awe of God; what Dread of his Judgments the good In&s;tructions of the Father had left on the Mind of this Youth.<LIST>

</LIST></P>
<P>NOTE, Tho' 'tis true, that in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Providence God does not deal &s;o with tho&s;e that bla&s;pheme and provoke him, yet &s;ince &s;ometimes God has done &s;o, and Hi|&s;tory, as well as Scripture, is full of dreadful Examples of that kind, it is not without its U&s;es, and therefore very commendable to ac|quaint young Children with &s;uch Examples,
<PB N="206" REF="211">
and to fill their Minds with a due Fear of God's Judgments in the like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Here is Room al&s;o for a u&s;eful Remark in the Complaint the poor Child makes, that having no Retirement for performing his Duty by him&s;elf; when he went about it publickly, the other Ser|vants mock'd and jeer'd him out of it.<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>NOTE,</HI> (1.) Tho' &s;eparate Conveniences can|not always be made for Servants, yet Ma&s;ters &s;hould, as much as may con&s;i&s;t with the Cir|cum&s;tances of their Families, be cautious of taking away all manner of Conveniences of Retirement from their Servants, le&s;t they furni&s;h them with Excu&s;es for not doing their Duty.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>NOTE,</HI> (2.) Jeering and mocking a Young-Man for his inclining to be Religious, is too often a Means to drive &s;uch quite from it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>NOTE,</HI> (3.) One of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Pre|&s;ervations of Youth, is, That he be fortified again&s;t the &s;candalous Banters and In&s;ults of his Companions; and can learn to be jeer'd, and yet not be jeer'd out of his Duty.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The other Part of this Dialogue affords a dread|ful in&s;tance of a Father and Family wholly de&s;ti|tute of Religion, living entirely without God, without Scripture, without &s;o much as a Form of Religion: The Effects of this are e&s;pecially two, and both vi&s;ible in the Ca&s;e here laid before us.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Perfect Ignorance of every thing that look'd like Religion in the Child, not &s;o much as the lea&s;t Sen&s;e of it, or De&s;ire to know any thing about it remaining.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Certain and never failing bitter Reproaches of the Child again&s;t the Parent, when its Eyes come to be opened.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="212"><HI>NOTE,</HI> Such is the Beauty of a religious, con|&s;cientious Life in tho&s;e that practice it, that tho&s;e who can ta&s;te nothing of it them&s;elves, yet have a Value for it in others: The pro|phane Boy's Father told him, he lov'd his Ma&s;ter <HI>becau&s;e he was a good Man,</HI> and that if he (the Boy) would take his Ma&s;ter's Advice, he would make him a better Man than his Father.</P>
<P><HI>NOTE,</HI> The Aver&s;ions which want of In&s;tru|ction in this Youth had bred in him again&s;t the Religious Behaviour of his Ma&s;ter, and again&s;t the publick Exerci&s;es of Religion in his Family, were &s;o fooli&s;hly grounded, that they would bear no weight in his di&s;cour&s;ing it, <HI>even with a Child;</HI> and therefore the Reli|gious Youth pre&s;ently objects again&s;t what he &s;ays, and he him&s;elf &s;ooner &s;ees the Folly of his own Di&s;cour&s;e; and yet the Author of this Work is ju&s;t al&s;o to the Thing it &s;elf, for that really our ridiculous Notions in Con|tempt of Religion, will admit no better Ar|gument to excu&s;e them.</P>
<P>Aver&s;ions to Religious Duties grow naturally ei|ther by Di&s;-u&s;e of tho&s;e Duties, or by the Di&s;a&s;ter of an ill Education, even where the poor hardned Child may think no Harm, or de&s;ign any willful Rebellion again&s;t God, that Ignorance being the natural Con&s;equence of want of In&s;truction.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erve here,</HI> when the wicked Boy being con|vinc'd, asks his Comrade what he mu&s;t do, he goes back to tell him what his own Father u&s;ed to teach him: Whence <HI>note,</HI> that well in&s;tructing our Children makes them capable to in&s;truct others, <HI>as Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents,</HI> and con&s;equently their Chil|dren, when they come to have Families of their own.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="213">
From the beginning of the wicked Boy's Con|victions, <HI>Note,</HI> that Sen&s;e of Danger is the fir&s;t thing ordinarily that di&s;covers it &s;elf in Conviction of Sin, and this leads to enquiring after what we are next to do; as the Jailor who fir&s;t came in trembling, then asks, <HI>What mu&s;t I do?</HI></P>
<P>When the Boy, after his fir&s;t Conviction, re|collects things by him&s;elf, <HI>while his Companion is gone for the Bible,</HI> he is &s;truck with Horror at his Condition, but the Spirit of God working graci|ou&s;ly in him, lays the Promi&s;e of God, <HI>as it were,</HI> full in his way, in order to give him hope, and at the fir&s;t Appearance of hope he breaks out vehe|mently in Prayer; when his Comrade returns, and innocently inquires about what he &s;aid, it appears from him, that his Prayer was a kind of Exta&s;ie, mov'd by a &s;upernatural Power in his Heart, that affected him in a violent manner, &s;o that he hardly could give an Account of it him&s;elf, but &s;ays wildly, <HI>he trembled and cried out.</HI></P>
<P>There are, no doubt, &s;uch &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions of the Spirit of God accompanying true Convi|ctions, and the great regenerating Work of Grace in the Heart, as may be inexpre&s;&s;ible, even by the Per&s;ons them&s;elves, yet far from <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tick,</HI> or affected, nor are the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions to be &s;lighted, much le&s;s ridicul'd; perhaps this may be in Part &s;ignified in Regeneration, being called a <HI>New Birth,</HI> tho' the main Intent of that Allu&s;ion be to &s;ignifie the entire Change of the State.</P>
<P>From the whole of this Dialogue may be ob|&s;erv'd the great Duty and Advantage of Young Men &s;pending the Hours they have to &s;pare for Conver&s;ation, in Religious Di&s;cour&s;es, and enqui|ring of one another about Things relating to Hea|ven, their Duty here, and their Way thither; this, no doubt, was enjoin'd in the &s;ame Text

<HEAD>The Second DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="dialogue">
<P>THE Young Lad who was put Appren|tice to the religious Trade&s;man above|mention'd, tho' he had no Education from his Parents, was, as you have heard in the pa&s;t Dialogue between him and the Youth his Comrade, brought to a Condition quite different-from what he had al|ways been brought up in, he had a full Conviction of the de&s;perate Condition he was in by rea&s;on of his &s;inful Nature and Life: He had receiv'd &s;ome Light from the little In&s;truction his young, but pious Companion, was capable to give him, and his Con&s;cience was thoroughly awaken'd; his lit|tle In&s;tructor had been providentially made the In&s;trument to lay a Foundation of Hope in him, and to encourage him to pray to God, and to read the Scriptures, and to believe that God would re|ceive him, would not reject him for his &s;inful Life, or for his &s;inful Nature, but would grant him <HI>what|&s;oever</HI> he &s;hould ask, and upon this Confidence in his fir&s;t Agony he breaks out, as before, into a &s;hort, but vehement Prayer, being the fir&s;t he had ever made in his Life; and which, as it was made from a Heart deeply touch'd with the Danger of his Soul, &s;o it left great Impre&s;&s;ions upon his Mind,
<PB N="211" REF="216">
as I have noted; and having gotten a Bible from his Companion, he goes away with two happy Re&s;olves, (1) to read, and (2) to pray.</P>
<P>The Alteration this made in the Youth, could not be long hid in the Family where he was plac'd, where his wicked way of Living, his prophane Tongue, and his Contempt of Religion, had made him not very well receiv'd, and made his Conver|&s;ation &s;o much their Aver&s;ion, that the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s too, had warn'd their little Children from conver&s;ing with him; and they had had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e together about turning him away, finding him of a Temper, as they thought, too refractory to be wrought upon by Advice, pa&s;t the Benefit of Example, and who had &s;everal times made a Je&s;t of, and a Scoff at their Attempts to in&s;truct him.</P>
<P>But the Boy being changed within, <HI>as is noted above,</HI> it could not be that &s;uch a Work could long conceal it &s;elf in his Conver&s;ation; he ap|pear'd pen&s;ive, retir'd, and grave in his Deport|ment, was ob&s;erv'd to <HI>&s;igh</HI> very often, and look as if he had been crying; as &s;oon as his Bu&s;ine&s;s was over, he was never to be &s;een, but always hid in the Dark, among the Work-hou&s;es, of which his Ma&s;ter had &s;everal; he was ob&s;erved to be always ready at the times of Family wor&s;hip, and on the Lord's Day, when his Ma&s;ter examin'd him about the Sermons he had heard, they were all &s;urpriz'd at him, for the ready Account he gave of what the Mini&s;ter had preached: His Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, who could not but ob&s;erve this Alteration in the Boy, took the more Notice of him in his Conver|&s;ation the Week after, where they found him di|ligent at his Work, more than ever, but nothing of the Mirth and Sport his Fellow Servants u&s;ed to have with him: They ob&s;erv'd he had left off
<PB N="212" REF="217">
all his ill Words, and wicked Expre&s;&s;ions, Swear|ing, Cur&s;ing, <HI>and the like;</HI> he play'd none, laugh'd none, and hardly was &s;een to &s;mile: Several of the Servants and Workmen that ob&s;erv'd it al&s;o, had been je&s;ting with him, and ask'd him what ail'd him; but he gave them no An&s;wers that were to the purpo&s;e, &s;o that it was hardly gue&s;s'd at in the Family, at lea&s;t, not among his Fellows.</P>
<P>But his Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, who from his Be|haviour, <HI>as above,</HI> had entertain'd &s;ome Notion of it, or being willing to hope the be&s;t, had pleas'd them&s;elves with &s;ome Thoughts of the Child's be|ing grown rather &s;erious, than melancholly, made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to ob&s;erve him more narrowly; and &s;eeing him one Evening take a Candle, and go up into a Room over their Work-hou&s;e, by him&s;elf, the Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ilently followed him, and plac'd her &s;elf &s;o, as &s;he might &s;ee him, and he perceived nothing of it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he came up he &s;et down the Candle, pull'd a Book out of his Pocket, and turn'd over the Leaves, folding up here, and folding down there, but not reading long in any one Place, &s;he ob&s;erv'd him to &s;igh grievou&s;ly all the while, and at la&s;t, to throw down the Book, and bur&s;t out into a vehe|ment Fit of crying, &s;itting down upon the Ground, wringing his Hands, and the Tears running down his Face, but not &s;peaking a Word.</P>
<P>While he was in this Agony, &s;he di&s;covers her|&s;elf to have &s;een him, and begins thus:</P>

<P>Poor Child! What mov'd thee to it then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I felt &s;ome &s;trange Motion in my Heart, which I cannot de&s;cribe, that made my Tongue &s;peak I almo&s;t know not what, for I thought it a

dreadful thing to &s;peak to God; and when I cried out <HI>Lord pardon my Sins,</HI> it &s;et me a weep|ing, and a trembling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that was a ble&s;&s;ed Beginning; why did you not go on, Child? You &s;hould have prayed again.</P>

<P>My Heart did, but I could &s;peak no words.</P>

<P>But <HI>Brother Tom</HI> told me I mu&s;t &s;peak too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Child,</HI> you may &s;peak, and it is proper for your own &s;ake that you &s;peak words, both to expre&s;s your Meaning, and move your Affections; but unle&s;s your Heart joins, it is not Prayer; God hears no Words that the Heart joins not in; but he hears many a Sigh from the Heart, which cannot be expre&s;s'd in Words: As is plain from that Text, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 26. <HI>The Spirit al&s;o helpeth our Infirmities, for we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it &s;elf maketh Interce&s;&s;ion with groanings which cannot be uttered.</HI> I hope it was the Spirit helped thy Heart to pray, when thou could'&s;t utter no Words, <HI>Child,</HI> there|fore do not be di&s;couraged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing what it was, or what the Spirit means, unle&s;s that I have &s;erved the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> all my Days, and now I mu&s;t have my Por|tion with the Devil and his Angels; this Book &s;ays &s;o, look here el&s;e.</P>

<P>You mu&s;t take the Scriptures as they explain them&s;elves; and you are bid to &s;earch the Scripture, that is, to &s;ee how one Place is ex|pounded by another; you &s;hould always pray to God to open your Under&s;tanding, that you may under&s;tand the Scripture; and the want of this makes even tho&s;e very Parts of the Scripture which &s;hould be our Comfort, be our Terror.</P>
</SP>

<P>Indeed the Young Man told me &s;o, but I did not do it.</P>

<P>When he gave me the Book, I thank'd him, and promi&s;ed him to read it, but he &s;aid, that was not all, I mu&s;t pray to God to teach me to under&s;tand his Word, and to &s;how me my Duty, and to guide my Heart to do it; but I did not know that I &s;hould always do this when I read the Bible.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt but you may pray very &s;ea|&s;onably for that at all times, and he was a good Child that taught thee to do &s;o; but it mu&s;t needs be more e&s;pecially &s;ea&s;onable to pray &s;o, when you are going to read the Bible, that you may be in&s;tructed to reap Comfort from God's Word, and not Terror only, <HI>as you have done.</HI></P>

<P>THE Impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e men|tion'd in the fir&s;t Dialogue that this Young Man had with his Comrade, were &s;o great, that they could not be concealed.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> A Change wrought in the Heart, will in|fallibly &s;hew it &s;elf in the Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s being good People them&s;elves, receiv'd Impre&s;&s;ions of the Alteration in the Boy, &s;uitable to the Nature of the thing, but the re&s;t of the Servants dreamt nothing of it.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> The Symptoms of Conver&s;ion are ea&s;ily di&s;covered by tho&s;e who know the working of the Spirit of God, while they are perfectly invi&s;ible to others.</P>
<P>By the Agony the Boy was in at the reading the Comminations of the Scripture again&s;t Sin, with|out the promi&s;ory Part, may be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>That meer Convictions of Sin drive to De&s;pair, but neither direct to, nor enquire after a Remedy.</P>
<P>That Comforting Scriptures generally want ex|plaining; terrifying Scriptures explain them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Here may be worth ob&s;erving,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Benefit of Religious Conver&s;ation, even among young Children, and the great Duty of making our Society in&s;tructing to one an|other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Advantage of placing Children in Reli|gious Families.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If this poor Child had not fallen in &s;uch a Family as this, the Temptation he was under to de&s;pair, might in all Probability have prevail'd over him, and either have led him to give over his Enquiry after Religious Matters or, if God had not re|&s;train'd

him, have driven him to Extremities, &s;uch as Di&s;traction, and perhaps, Self-de&s;truction, as is often the Con&s;equence too in like Ca&s;es; for, <HI>a wounded Spirit who can bear.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the poor Child's Fear of its being too late for him to find Mercy, or be accepted.</P>
<P>If it might be too late for him, what have they to fear who run on to grey Hairs in an impenitent State! Well might his Mi&s;tre&s;s ob&s;erve, that <HI>his too late</HI> was &s;ooner than <HI>her early,</HI> and &s;o it is with many.</P>
<P>From the good Woman's applying the Scrip|tures to him for Comfort, ob&s;erve how the Scrip|tures are to be read.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. With &s;erious &s;eeking God for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit to open our Under&s;tandings, that we may under&s;tand the Scriptures; for with|out his Teaching, all our Reading will be in vain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. With a due comparing one Text with an|other, that the Scriptures being their own ju&s;t Expo&s;itor, may reconcile the Truths of God, as they ought to be under&s;tood.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For want of this, we rob our &s;elves of the Comfort of the Scriptures; pa&s;s over tho&s;e Things prepared to heal and re&s;tore the Soul, and fill our Hearts with di&s;tracting Doubts about our own State, which are always hard|er to be re&s;olved and removed, by how much they &s;eem confirmed by the mi&s;taken Autho|rity of the Scripture.</ITEM>

<DIV3 TYPE="dialogue">
<P>THE Young Lad who had been &s;o hap|pily In&s;trumental in the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of his Comrade, had thereby render'd him&s;elf &s;o agreeable to the good People, who, as I &s;aid before, was Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the other Lad, that they could not but be very willing to con|ver&s;e a little with him them&s;elves; and to that End cau&s;ed their Apprentice, who called him <HI>Bro|ther,</HI> to bring him to their Hou&s;e; where in time, he became very intimate, and they were much plea&s;ed and diverted with his pretty Di&s;cour&s;es, which were always about Religion, and &s;erious Things.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of his Di&s;cour&s;e, he never forgot to bemoan him&s;elf for his being placed in a Family of no Religious Orders, without the Wor&s;hip of God in it; and where he had neither publick Op|portunity to &s;erve God, or private Retirement for the Di&s;charge of his Duty.</P>
<P>The good People encouraged him to bear it, and &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;ed him not to let the Sen&s;e of his own Duty to wear off, or allow him&s;elf in the Omi&s;&s;ion of private Prayer to God, whatever Ob&s;tructions he met with for Want of Retire|ment
<PB N="229" REF="234">
and Opportunity; and invited him to come over to their Hou&s;e, as often as he could at their Hours of Family-Wor&s;hip, and join with them.</P>
<P>This he not only gladly accepted, but con&s;tantly attended, and did it &s;o avowedly, not regarding how it might interfere with his Ma&s;ter's Hours, and his own Conveniencies, that his Ma&s;ter took Offence at his being &s;o often out of the way, and not knowing the lea&s;t of what occa&s;ioned his Ab|&s;ence, complain'd to his Father of it, as if it had been &s;ome wicked Cour&s;e he had followed; telling him, <HI>that</HI> his Son did not behave him&s;elf orderly; <HI>that</HI> he was out of his Bu&s;ine&s;s un&s;ea&s;onably; <HI>that</HI> he mu&s;t have &s;ome bad Haunts, for that he gene|rally went out every Morning very early, (being then Winter) long before Day; and in the Eve|nings was ab&s;ent often at Supper; <HI>that</HI> on the Lord's Day Evening he was never to be found; <HI>and the like;</HI> and therefore de&s;ired his Father to take &s;ome Care about him, for that if he went on, he would be ruin'd: He farther acquainted his Father, that the Boy had appear'd very melan|cholly, and di&s;contented; that he had ask'd him often if any thing ail'd him, or that he was not well, and he always an&s;wer'd, <HI>yes;</HI> that he had ask'd him if he did not like his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;till he an&s;wer'd, <HI>yes, very well;</HI> &s;o that he knew not what ail'd him, and de&s;ir'd his Father to talk with him, for if he carried it thus, he could not bear it, but mu&s;t &s;end him Home again.</P>
<P><HI>The Father,</HI> who knew his Son to be a &s;ober, re|ligious Child, and partly knew the Rea&s;on of his Di&s;content, was not at all &s;urpriz'd at that Part of his Ma&s;ter's Complaint, which related to his appearing melancholly, and di&s;&s;atisfied; but the other Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e alarm'd him a little, about being out of the Hou&s;e at un&s;ea&s;onable Hours,

and giving no Account of him&s;elf; and therefore he readily promi&s;ed to talk with his Son, and exa|mine him about it, that his Conduct might be rectified.</P>
<P>Accordingly he finds an Opportunity to talk with the Lad, and lets him know all his Ma&s;ter had laid to his Charge, charging him to tell him the Truth of the whole Matter: The Boy, not at all &s;urpriz'd, told his Father the whole Ca&s;e very hone&s;tly; <HI>how that</HI> his Ma&s;ter had no &s;uch Thing as Family-wor&s;hip in his Hou&s;e, but that they li|ved all like Heathens there; pur&s;uing <HI>the World,</HI> as if it was their Heaven, without the lea&s;t regard of their Duty to God, or any thing that was reli|gious: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And you, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Boy to his Father,</HI> having always in&s;tructed me in other Things, and taught me to live after another Manner; it was very unea&s;ie to me, as I have formerly hin|ted to you; but I have of late made my &s;elf a lit|tle ea&s;ie, by getting an Acquaintance in Mr. &mdash;'s Family, an hone&s;t Clothier, who lives over a|gain&s;t our Hou&s;e, who are very good People, and who con&s;tantly go to Prayers every Morn|ing at Six a Clock, and every Evening about Eight or Nine; and I get up every Morning to go over there to Prayers with their Family; and every Lord's Day I go thither in the Eve|ning, where the good Man reads to his Family, and examins his Children and Servants, and then prays with them; while, at our Hou&s;e, all the Evening is &s;pent in Fea&s;ting, and Vi&s;iting, or idle Di&s;cour&s;e, not at all to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day: And this is the whole Ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>When the Lad had ended his Di&s;cour&s;e, and the Father was a&s;&s;ur'd of the Truth of it, he took his Son in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ed and embraced him very affectionately, and &s;aid,</P>

<P>It is true; they do not put their Children Apprentices to learn Religion; but neither do they put them Apprentices <HI>to lo&s;e their Religion;</HI> and to have all the Pains their Parents have taken with them, &s;unk again: There is a kind of In&s;tru|ction &s;ub&s;equent to Catechi&s;ms, and Examinations; <HI>there are kinds</HI> of In&s;tructions &s;uited to the Age, and Circum&s;tances; and &s;uch an In&s;tructor every Ma&s;ter of a Family ought to be, to his Servants, as well as to his Children.</P>

<P><HI>Suppo&s;e that were true,</HI> the Nature of the Thing is &s;o plain, that there needed no particular Scripture to command it in expre&s;s Terms; and yet you will find Scripture enough for it too; in the Examples of good Men; particularly in <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who re&s;olv'd to &s;erve the Lord, <HI>he,</HI> and <HI>his Hou&s;e;</HI> And how could that be, if he did not in&s;truct, or command his Servants to do &s;o? <HI>Da|vid</HI> &s;ays, a Lyar &s;hall not dwell with him: What is more plain, than that he re&s;olved to correct the irreligious Behaviour of his whole Hou&s;hold, as well Servants as Children, and to turn away tho&s;e who were incorrigible? But the Fourth Com|mandment puts it cut of Que&s;tion, and is ex|pre&s;s in the Ca&s;e of the keeping the Sabbath; mark the Words, <HI>In it thou &s;halt do no manner of Work; THO&V;,</HI> there's the Ma&s;ter's Duty for him&s;elf: The next Part, is his Duty in &s;eeing that his Family &s;hall perform it as well as him&s;elf; <HI>NOR thy Son.

<P>This Commandment expre&s;ly declares, that the Servants are &s;ubjected to the Ma&s;ter's Command, in matters relating to their Duty to God; and that Ma&s;ters are oblig'd to &s;ee that their Servants perform it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very far from putting it off from my &s;elf; I &s;hall concur with you mo&s;t readily in the &s;tricte&s;t Examination into his Behaviour; but I am &s;urpriz'd to hear you put it off from your &s;elf, as if you were not concern'd in it; and by which, if his Cour&s;es are evil, as you &s;ugge&s;t, he may be ruined at any time, and I may know no|thing of it; and you mu&s;t allow that this ought to give me &s;ome Concern as a Father, whatever it does to you as a Ma&s;ter.</P>

That does not hang together at all: <HI>Why,</HI> he is the mo&s;t profligate young Vil|lain that ever came into any good Man's Hou&s;e: His Ma&s;ter was talking, in my Hearing, but the other Day, of &s;ending him to the Hou&s;e of Corre|ction, and &s;poke to me for a Warrant; your Ac|quaintance with &s;uch a Boy as that, is not likely to be for &s;o good a Purpo&s;e; and this Part makes all the re&s;t unlikely, and to be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He was &s;o,</HI> Sir, that is true; but if you enquire, you will find he is another thing now: God's Grace has made a &s;trange Change in that Boy in a few Weeks pa&s;t; if you plea&s;e to in|form your &s;elf of it, Sir, you may hear it from other Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this the whole Truth, <HI>Thomas?</HI> Has this been your whole Bu&s;ine&s;s there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it has, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t not think much if I enquire, in order to be better &s;atisfied.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Notes</HI> on the Third Dialogue.</HEAD>
<P>THERE &s;eems to be more Circumlocutions in this Dialogue, than in any of the re&s;t; but they will be found not u&s;eful only but nece&s;&s;ary at lea&s;t to pre&s;erve the Cadence of Things, and introduce the Sub&s;tance of the real Story by nece&s;&s;ary Gradations; the Boy's &s;hifting off &s;o many Ways, before he directly tells his Ma|&s;ter the whole of his Bu&s;ine&s;s: Is a Mark of com|mendable Mode&s;ty in a Servant; his Shyne&s;s of &s;peaking what he knew touch'd his Ma&s;ter's Be|haviour more than his own, may be very in|&s;tructing to Servants, if they plea&s;e to mark it, in Things where their Ma&s;ter's Character may be concern'd: <HI>But above all,</HI> it may be noted, that all the&s;e Things tend to bring the Conviction home with the more Energy and Force upon the Con|&s;cience of the Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter's Di&s;cour&s;e with the Young Man's Father contains a great many u&s;eful Hints about the Duty of Ma&s;ters to their Servants. (1.) That they ought to reckon them under their Care as well as under their Government. (2.) That the Charge of the Souls of our Servants lies upon us, as well as tho&s;e of our Children; the ju&s;t Di&s;tinction between a PARENT and a FATHER, is fruitful of many u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations, <HI>the la&s;t</HI> is tied by Na|ture; <HI>the fir&s;t,</HI> by the God of Nature; <HI>the la&s;t,</HI> by Affection; <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> by Duty; <HI>but both</HI> are tied to di&s;charge the Part of a Chri&s;tian Parent to the Souls under their Charge, whether Servants, Children, or Relations: That a Servant taken
<PB N="251" REF="256">
into the Family, becomes a Child of the Family, and ought equally with our Children, to partake of every Part of our Religious Duties; &s;uch as Prayer, Exhortation, Examination, In&s;truction, Reproof, Re&s;traint, and Correction: This is farther plain, from what God &s;ays of <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gene&s;is 18. 19. <HI>That he will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold;</HI> that is, He will di&s;charge faithfully the Duty of a Parent, or Guide and Governor of a Family; which is &s;hown in his commanding his whole Hou&s;e, to walk in the Ways of God.</P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> How Cu&s;tom has wickedly of late years &s;eem'd to di&s;charge Ma&s;ters of this Duty.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>By the Pride of Servants,</HI> who bringing large Sums of Money, much greater than formerly, &s;eem to expect not to be &s;o much at Com|mands as they u&s;ed to be: A wicked and abo|minable Cu&s;tom, which as no Religious Pa|rent can be ea&s;ie in it, &s;o no Religious Ma|&s;ter ought to be &s;ubjected to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By the Negligence of Parents who really &s;eem le&s;s to concern them&s;elves about the Souls of their Children when they put them out as Apprentices, than about their learning Trades, doing their Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>and the like.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By the univer&s;al Backwardne&s;s of Ma&s;ters, who think, <HI>as this Man did,</HI> that they have no Concern upon them about their Servants Souls, or any thing but ju&s;t to &s;ee that their Bu&s;ine&s;s is done, and then to let them go where they plea&s;e, and do what they plea&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Ob&s;erve here a mo&s;t ridiculous Argument or Excu&s;e, which the Ma&s;ter brings, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he was a&s;ham'd to go about in&s;tructing
<PB N="252" REF="257">
or praying with his Apprentices and Journey|men, becau&s;e <HI>they would laugh at him!</HI> Note, we are ea&s;ier to be laugh'd OUT OF our Duty than per&s;waded INTO IT.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>From the whole,</HI> Ma&s;ters of Families may ob|&s;erve, the Duty of in&s;tructing, and religiou&s;ly guiding their Servants, lies indi&s;pen&s;ably upon them, as much as that of in&s;tructing and educating their Children: They are <HI>PARENTS,</HI> that is, <HI>Guides</HI> and <HI>Governors</HI> to their whole Hou&s;e, tho' they are <HI>FATHERS</HI> only to <HI>their Children.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Fourth DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of the Young Man afore|&s;aid, now makes a Vi&s;it to his Neigh|bour the Clothier, who lived over a|gain&s;t his Hou&s;e, whether he had any doubt of the Truth of what the Boy had &s;aid to him, and had a Mind, <HI>as he had &s;aid to the Lad him&s;elf,</HI> to find out the bottom of it; or perhaps, to &s;atisfie him&s;elf farther about the Alteration of the wicked Boy, which his own Ser|vant had acquainted him of, or to plea&s;e his own Curio&s;ity, or directed by Providence for his far|ther Conviction, <HI>is not material;</HI> but here di&s;|cour&s;ing of other Things with the good Man and his Wife, he begins the following Dialogue <HI>thus,</HI> talking of their Servants.</P>
<SP>
<P>I Remember, Neighbour, you were once com|plaining of a very bad Servant you had, and talk'd as if you wanted a Warrant of me to &s;end him to the Hou&s;e of Correction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clothier</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes an't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, I did &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Note, He was an Alderman in the Country Town, and &s;o a Magi&s;trate at that time.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aderman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and pray how does he behave him&s;elf now? Shall you want a Warrant, Neigh|bour?
<PB N="254" REF="259">
You know I &s;hall always be ready to &s;erve you in any thing I can; it &s;hall co&s;t you nothing if you have any &s;uch Occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not now, Sir, I think that Lad is much reformed; tho' I have had many bad Ser|vants, I never had a wor&s;e than he was, but he is wonderfully changed; <HI>however,</HI> I thank your Wor&s;hip for your kind Offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Wife.</HI> You are very happy, <HI>Sir,</HI> in that Part, for you have very good Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>but indifferent;</HI> I have had my &s;hare of Trouble that way as well as you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ure you have &s;ome very good ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> but I am very glad to hear that your bad one is mended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, <HI>Sir,</HI> indeed he is very much mended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very rare that bad Servants grow better; I have often heard of good Servants that have grown wor&s;e; I am &s;ure with me they do &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Indeed, Sir,</HI> I hope this Lad of mine will prove a very good young Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good! Why you repre&s;ented him to me as one of the wor&s;t Wretches that ever came into your Hou&s;e; if I remember right, you &s;aid he was given to Lying, and Swearing, Scoffing at Reli|gion, and at every thing that was good, and was him&s;elf every thing that was bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed he was &s;o, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not you did all you could to re|claim him, I know you would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I endeavoured, <HI>Sir,</HI> to di&s;charge my Con|&s;cience towards him; but I had no Satisfaction in it, <HI>only &s;o far,</HI> that I had done my Duty; I could do no more, and I was quite tir'd out with him; indeed I re&s;olved to put him away, for I could not
<PB N="255" REF="260">
bear him among my Children; he was enough to &s;poil all the Children in the Pari&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a great Advantage <HI>Neighbour,</HI> that I have not; I am in &s;uch a continual hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that I cannot look after my Family as I would do; I have no Lei&s;ure to di&s;charge my Duty to my Servants; you have Lei&s;ure, Neighbour, and your Servants have the Advantage of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Truly, Sir,</HI> If I have Lei&s;ure, it is my Lo&s;s, for my Livelyhood depends upon my being em|ployed, as well as my Servants; but they that are taught to know their Duty, will always find Lei|&s;ure to do it; <HI>I doubt not,</HI> Sir, but you di&s;charge your &s;elf better that way, than I can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;een plainly in your Servants them|&s;elves, that you do your Duty to them, Sir; &s;ure never any body had &s;uch Servants as you have!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nay, Neighbour!</HI> do not &s;ay I di&s;charge my Duty better than you; <HI>God forgive me!</HI> I don't di&s;charge it at all, I mean to my Apprentices; I take no Care about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Wife. That is then,</HI> becau&s;e they are &s;o good, and &s;o religious, that they need no In&s;pe|ction; <HI>for you know, Sir,</HI> we are to in&s;truct our Servants as well as our Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I cannot &s;ay that I have made that much of my Concern; for our Apprentices gene|rally come of pretty good Families, and bring Mo|ney with them, and they think them&s;elves above being talk'd to about &s;uch things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they are among tho&s;e who <HI>Solomon</HI> calls Fools, that De&s;pi&s;e In&s;truction; and if they reject your Offers to in&s;truct them, I cannot &s;ee what you can do in that Ca&s;e: That was my very Ca&s;e with this Boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you have had a great deal of Trouble with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="256" REF="261">
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed, &s;o I have; I was quite weary of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had the Report of a very wicked Boy,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I was a&s;ham'd to have it &s;aid, &s;uch a Boy was in my Hou&s;e: I was afraid any of the Neighbours Children &s;hould come near him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I have a Young Man, I believe is not much the better for him; I have been chiding him a little about it: But is he really chang'd and reform'd think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Indeed that he is,</HI> and mo&s;t wonderfully too, <HI>I ble&s;s God for it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>I que&s;tion not but you have taken a great deal of Pains with him; but are you not deceiv'd? Is he not a Cheat, and plays the Hypocrite?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>If ever there was a true Convert in the World, I believe he is one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very happy that God has &s;o far ble&s;s'd your Endeavours with the Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><HI>Wife.</HI> Not our Endeavours, <HI>Sir,</HI> at all; we were denied that Ble&s;&s;ing; it comes all from you, Sir; the Ble&s;&s;ing is from your Hou&s;e.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P><HI>Yes indeed,</HI> I found that a young Lad I have newly bound, was acquainted with this Boy of yours: And that he was often abroad with him, and it has cau&s;ed &s;ome Di&s;turbance among us; for knowing your Lad was &s;o wicked a Boy, I forbid him his Company.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why our <HI>Thomas</HI> is a poor melancholly di&s;contented Boy, a meer Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He is &s;uch a Child, <HI>Sir,</HI> as I never met with the like; I find you do not know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why,</HI> I never thought there was any thing in him; he is but young; and indeed we all thought him young in every Thing; it is true, He is a &s;ober mode&s;t Sort of a Boy, and talks pretty well; but I never &s;aw any thing extraor|dinary in him; he is &s;o melancholly and di&s;con|tented, we thought him di&s;temper'd; and I have been at the Point of turning him away.</P>
</SP>

<P><HI>You know Sir,</HI> the Scripture &s;ays, That <HI>out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings he has ordained Prai&s;e;</HI> this Child <HI>as you call him,</HI> is an excellent Chri&s;tian, and beyond his Years capable of &s;hew|ing it. Perhaps Sir, you never tried him.</P>

<P>No indeed <HI>not I,</HI> as I &s;aid to you before Neighbour, I have no Time to trouble my &s;elf a|bout my Prentices; I mean as to &s;uch Things.</P>

<P>Yes, <HI>all of it;</HI> he was the general Mocker of every Thing that was good; and began to do &s;o in your young Man's Company; and he was the fir&s;t that reproved him for it: And he did it &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;o effectually, that it has plea&s;ed GOD to work on him <HI>as you &s;ee.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wife,</HI> What Time is it exactly <HI>Sir,</HI> that you &s;ay he comes and goes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ald.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I under&s;tand it he goes out about Six, and is back between Six and Seven, which looked
<PB N="260" REF="265">
to me as if he came hither before you were up, and a&s;&s;oon as he found you beginning to &s;tir, comes off again, and would not be &s;een.</P>

<P>Well, my Wife got it out of him <HI>&s;ome time after,</HI> when pre&s;&s;ing him to tell her what it was that troubled him, he told her his Ca&s;e was very &s;ad; his Ma&s;ter was a good Man, and he liked his Bu&s;ine&s;s very well, but that his Ma&s;ter looked upon him as a Heathen, or as &s;ome vile Creature, for that Morning and Evening when he went up as he &s;uppo&s;ed to Prayers with his Children, he would never let him be called up, or admitted among them; &s;o that he &s;aid he believed his Ma|&s;ter thought him not worthy taking any care of; or el&s;e it was a Judgment of GOD upon him for his Sins; and this troubled him &s;o, he could not enjoy him&s;elf, and the poor Child wept grievou&s;ly when he had told it her: <HI>Now Sir,</HI> as this relates to your Family Affairs, I was very unwilling to mention it, lea&s;t you &s;hould be angry.</P>

<P>We could not but pity the poor Young Man, and my Wife exhorted him, however to take Care to be the more diligent in his private Duty to GOD, and not to let the want of Family Prayer be a Means to thru&s;t out Prayer altogether: At this Di&s;cour&s;e he wept again more than before, and told her; that he had no Retreat for private Prayer, and that when at fir&s;t he did kneel down
<PB N="264" REF="269">
by his Bed &s;ide to pray to GOD, when he went to Bed, the other Apprentices would laugh at him, jeer him, and interrupt him; &s;o that he was for|ced to leave it off again; that he was afterwards tempted to believe, that having the&s;e Hinderances he was di&s;charged from the Duty, and having no Conveniencies for it, was a ju&s;t Excu&s;e for omit|ting it; and the Fear that he &s;hould grow loo&s;e, and willing to omit his Duty entirely; oppre&s;t his Mind &s;o, that he thought it would break his Heart.

<HEAD>The Fifth DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;e of the good Man and his Wife had &s;uch an Effect upon the Country Alderman, e&s;pecially with the Addition, from the Account he had received of the Conduct of his Apprentice, that it cau&s;ed him &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on his Family Conduct, and convinc'd him that he had been quite out of the Way of his Duty as a Ma&s;ter of his Family to his Servants, as well as in his Relation of a Father to his Children; and the&s;e Convictions put him upon Re&s;olutions of altering his Conduct in his Family.</P>
<P>But here, as in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, where a Religious Oeconomy is not e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Beginning, in&s;uperable Difficulties appeared to him; which &s;everal Times di&s;couraged him, &s;lackned his Re|&s;olution, and cooled his Mind &s;o, as to incline him rather to go on in the Neglect as he had be|gun, believing it too late to refrain; But two un|expected providential Accidents &s;urprized him into his Duty, the happy Con&s;equences whereof will appear, for the Encouragement of other Ma&s;ters of Families in the like Attempt, of reforming their Practice, and applying them&s;elves to &s;et up a Re|ligious
<PB N="268" REF="273">
Government in their Hou&s;holds, notwith|&s;tanding all pretended Difficulties.</P>
<P>The Difficulties he had before him were Two; Fir&s;t, he had married a Lady who differed from him in Opinion; he had been bred a Di&s;&s;enter from the Church, and his Wife had been bred in Conformity to the Church, and continued &s;o: And as this Kind of marrying, however not at all un|lawful, is not always the greate&s;t Help to, or for|warder of a Religious Family, &s;o he (tho' erro|neou&s;ly) judged his Wife might not be willing to join with him in his Way of Family Wor&s;hip, if he &s;hould begin it: <HI>Again,</HI> as to his Servants, his Apprentices and Journy-men, &s;everal of which he had, were <HI>Men grown,</HI> &s;uch as &s;eemed to be pa&s;t Government; and as they had none of them any appearing Inclination to what was Religious, he having always indulged them in a total Neglect of &s;uch Things, he thought they would but make a Je&s;t of him, and that he &s;hould never be able to bring them to conform to any Thing of Family Orders. As to his Children, they were Young, and he did not &s;o much con&s;ider them in the Ca&s;e; And tho&s;e that were any Thing grown up were abroad at the Boarding School: Now in both the&s;e Ca&s;es he was happily di&s;appointed, Provi|dence removed both the Difficulties at once, &s;o as to take from him any kind of Excu&s;e for the fur|ther Neglect of his Duty.</P>
<P>It &s;oon became known in the Hou&s;e, that <HI>Thomas</HI> and his Ma&s;ter had had &s;ome Words about his going out every Morning and Evening to the Clothiers; nor could it be hid upon what Occa|&s;ion he went thither; and his Ma&s;ter had &s;poken of it to another of his Servants, that the Young Man &s;hould not be hindred, for that he was very well &s;atisfied of the Bu&s;ine&s;s he went about. As it
<PB N="269" REF="274">
was known among the Servants, it could not be concealed from the Mi&s;tre&s;s, who being a very pi|ous Religious Lady her &s;elf, &s;eem'd not a little concerned at the Thing; and having ob&s;erved her Husband to be more than u&s;ually thoughtful and melancholly for &s;ome Time; She imagined &s;ome|thing about that Apprentice had di&s;turb'd him; both which Circum&s;tances put together, occa&s;io|ned the following Di&s;cour&s;e betwixt them.</P>

<P>Why, I alledged he was his Son, that I could do no more than acquaint him with his Con|duct, and that he mu&s;t take care of the re&s;t; that my Part was to teach him his Trade, and &s;ee that my Bu&s;ine&s;s was done, but as to the re&s;t it lay upon him, and that I had di&s;charged my &s;elf in giving him this Account of his Son. He affirmed the contrary, that I was in his Place e&s;&s;entially, that as I had a Right to his Time, &s;o I was obliged to exact an Account of it from him, as much as I would of Money committed to him to pay, <HI>and the like;</HI> and &s;o we fell into a long Di&s;pute about the Di&s;tinction of a Parent and a Father; he affirmed that I was a Parent to the Boy, tho' not a Father, and that the Duty of taking Care of him both Soul and Body was mine.</P>

<P>I am not capable to argue the&s;e Things; but I confe&s;s, I mu&s;t be very much of his Opi|nion; for I think when a Father commits his Child to us, if he puts his Body under our Care, and not his Soul, pray what mu&s;t become of the Youth? Mu&s;t he be left without Government to be ruined?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, If that be my Duty, I have &s;adly neglected it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>my Dear,</HI> I have often thought &s;o; e&s;pecially when I have heard you &s;ay to your Pren|tices, that you only required their con&s;tant At|tendance at &s;uch and &s;uch Hours, and that for the re&s;t of the time they might go where they pleas'd: I could not think Young Men &s;hould be left &s;o en|tirely to their own Di&s;po&s;al, I am per&s;waded no &s;ober Father would like it; I am &s;ure, if any of my Sons &s;hould come to be put out, I &s;hould be very &s;orry to put them to a Ma&s;ter that &s;hould do &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I &s;ee I have been in an Error, but what &s;hould I have done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>My Dear,</HI> Why do you ask me what you &s;hould do? Am I fit to teach you?</P>

<P>Indeed any Body may teach me; I have been taught lately by a meaner In&s;tructor than you.</P>

<P>But you may give your Advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>In &s;uch Ca&s;es, there is little Difference betwixt advi&s;ing and teaching, except in the Ar|rogance of the Word; be&s;ides, Advice is gene|rally asked before it is given; if it be given before it be asked, it is rather an Admonition or Reproof than an Advice.</P>
</SP>

<P>But <HI>my Dear,</HI> you might abate Ceremo|nies with me, what would you have &s;uppo&s;ed to

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will have it be &s;o that I mu&s;t give my Opinion; I mu&s;t be very plain, that I think you have a great deal more to do; that when they are committed to your Charge by their Parents, their whole Behaviour is under your Care; and that tho' &s;erving God is their particular Duty, and lies upon them, yet it is your Duty to &s;ee, <HI>as far as in you lies,</HI> that they perform it; and at your Hands their Souls will be required, if you neglect <HI>your Duty,</HI> and indulge them in the Neglect <HI>of their own.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>my Dear,</HI> you mu&s;t explain the words <HI>as far as in me lies,</HI> that is the Thing I &s;peak of; my Bu&s;ine&s;s is their Work, if they neglect that, I am to &s;ee it remedied; but as to their Morals and Religion, if I &s;ee Cau&s;e to di&s;like, I acquaint their Parents; is not that doing the Thing as far as in me lies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay <HI>that it is;</HI> you may do much more than that, or el&s;e what does that &s;ignifie? For when a Father knows of his Son's wicked Cour&s;es, what can he do? He is under your Care for Correction, and under his Father's only for Admonition; for he is your Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant their Fathers would think it very hard that I &s;hould correct one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other Hand, I believe you would take it very ill to have one of their Fathers come to your Shop and <HI>cane</HI> or <HI>correct</HI> one of your Pren|tices, you would &s;ay he took the Work out of your Hands.</P>

<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Abate that Nicety for once, <HI>my Dear,</HI> and make no Scruple to &s;ay what you think is my Duty to my Servants; tho' you do not think it your Part to teach me my Duty, you may be a Means to convince me, that &s;omething was my Duty, which I did not think was my Duty before; and I may learn from you what you do not &s;et up to teach; there need not be &s;o much Shyne&s;s between a Wife and her Husband; that for Fear of taking too much upon you to teach me, you &s;hould omit a kind Hint to me of what you think I ought to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not refrain for that &s;o much, as that I think you know your Part &s;o well, that it is perfectly unrea&s;onable and needle&s;s for me to offer any Thing; be&s;ides, Family Government is &s;o natural a Con&s;equence to the very Being and Con&s;titution of Ma&s;ter and Servant, Father and Child, Husband and Wife, that no Husband <HI>of your Capacity</HI> can be ignorant; the Scripture is &s;o
<PB N="276" REF="281">
full on the Side of tho&s;e who are to be governed, that it cannot but lead directly to tho&s;e who are the Governours: Wives are bid to &s;ubmit them|&s;elves to their Husbands; Children to obey their Parents; Servants to be Subject to their Ma&s;ters; all which naturally implies, that the Government of the whole Family devolves entirely upon the Head of the Ma&s;ter, who has the whole Charge of them, Soul and Body, and is accountable for their Mi&s;carriages, &s;o far as tho&s;e Mi&s;carriages are owing to the Omi&s;&s;ion of his Duty.</P>

<SP>

<P>But <HI>My Dear,</HI> we differ then about the Word <HI>Government,</HI> and how far that extends be|yond my commanding them in the Offices of an Apprentice, and their doing my Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I think it extends to every thing el&s;e; we are obliged by the Fourth Commandment not to &s;uffer our Servants to break the Sabbath, and &s;o of every Duty in the other Commands; and no Que&s;tion but 'tis our Duty to re&s;train them from every evil Action, whereby they may offend GOD, or wrong their Neighbour: I mean as much as is in our Power; and on the other Hand, we are to encourage them in all that is good, <HI>viz.</HI> in their Duty to GOD and Man, and this by all po&s;&s;ible Methods, &s;uch as Exhortation, Command, Advice, <HI>viz.</HI> but e&s;pecially Example; praying to GOD for them and with them.</P>

<P><HI>Alas!</HI> What can a Wife do in &s;uch a Family as ours is? it is not worth naming: The Wor&s;hip of God in a Family ought to be avowed and owned by the Ma&s;ter of the Family, and per|formed either by him&s;elf or Chaplains, with due Gravity and Solemnity, &s;uitable to the Authority of the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and &s;uitable to the Authority and Greatne&s;s of that God to whom it is directed; and there is not a Servant &s;o wicked, &s;o profligate, &s;o prophane, but would reverence the Practice, if they did not profit by the Performance.</P>

And have you not &s;een me readily join in Family Wor&s;hip at your Brother's, as you have done with us at my Father's?

<P>Why, <HI>my Dear,</HI> he threw all the Work back upon me, <HI>as I told you,</HI> but I believe the I&s;&s;ue was, that both he <HI>and I al&s;o,</HI> talked to <HI>Thomas</HI> about his Di&s;content, and his Melancholly, and about his going out of Doors.</P>

<P>The Daughter who of the two appeared the mo&s;t Ob&s;trnate, and could not bear the Re&s;traint which her Father's new Di&s;cipline obliged her to, got leave of her Father and Mother, to go and live with her Aunt, <HI>her Father's Si&s;ter,</HI> who lived at &s;ome Di&s;tance from them in <HI>London,</HI> where tho' the Family was &s;trictly Religious, <HI>as is before no|ted,</HI> yet being there but as a Gue&s;t, &s;he could bet|ter

<P>The Young Gentleman was the Elde&s;t Son of the Family, and Heir to his Father who had a good E&s;tate, he had been bred a Gentleman, had a li|beral Education, was a hand&s;ome agreeable Per|&s;on, and which was beyond all, was <HI>like his Father,</HI> a &s;ober, virtuous, &s;tudious and religious Gentle|man: This Per&s;on having been conver&s;ant with this young Lady, by the Accident of their being in the Hou&s;e; and as will appear, &s;he being very agree|able to him, <HI>however engaged by the Defect of E|ducation in Gayety and Mirth, and hard to be weaned, e&s;pecially by Violence as had been her Ca&s;e,</HI> her Di&s;po&s;ition I &s;ay being &s;oft and of an extraor|dinary Sweetne&s;s in her Temper as will be &s;een in the Proce&s;s of the&s;e Sheets, there appear'd a par|ticular Suitablene&s;s in them one to another.</P>
<P>The Young Gentleman had entertained an O|pinion of her being capable to make him a very good Wife; tho' he was not ignorant of her be|ing wild, and gay in her Humour, yet he had great Proofs by daily Conver&s;ation with her, of her being virtuous and mode&s;t, even to the utmo&s;t Nicety; the Goodne&s;s of her Temper, and agree|ablene&s;s of her Per&s;on, had engaged his Affections
<PB N="298" REF="303">
to her, and he had no Rea&s;on to believe that &s;he had any Aver&s;ion to him; whereupon he broke his De&s;ign to his Father, who knowing his Son's Sobriety, and &s;erious Inclination, was the le&s;s in|clin'd to thwart his Affections; and the le&s;s afraid to venture him in the Matter of the young La|dy's Humour, tho' it was thought to be a little extravagant and gay <HI>as above;</HI> &s;o the Father after &s;ome Con&s;ideration calling him a&s;ide one Morning, &s;poke to him to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<SP>
<P>SON, I have con&s;idered what you &s;aid to me about your De&s;ire to court your Cou&s;in, I am very willing to gra|tifie your Inclinations, in any Thing that may have a Pro&s;pect of making you ea&s;y and happy, and &s;hall be as kind to you with Re&s;pect to E&s;tate, as you can expect; but <HI>you know</HI> &s;he is gay, and wild, loves Company and Mirth; and that it was her Impatience of Re&s;traint in the&s;e Things, that made the Breach between her and her Father, and if &s;he &s;hould conti|nue that Humour, after you have married her, I doubt you will have but an uncomfortable Life with her: <HI>However,</HI> I do not think her of an ill Di&s;po|&s;ition as to her natural Temper; and perhaps &s;he may be prevailed with by good &V;&s;age and kind Treatment, <HI>which I hope is all the Method you propo&s;e to take with her,</HI> to alter her Notions of Things; <HI>I</HI> think &s;he &s;eems to be a little come off from &s;ome Part of it, &s;ince &s;he came into our Family, I would have you &s;e|riou&s;ly con&s;ider what Hazard you run in it, <HI>and e|&s;pecially that the Venture is for your Life;</HI> and as I have no other Objection again&s;t it, I &s;hall agree or not agree to it, as your Inclination &s;hall lead you, only not forgetting to hint to you, <HI>what I hope you do not forget,</HI> (viz.) That you ask Council and Di|rection

<P>Well, but you mu&s;t wait a little, her Temper may be wrought upon by Degrees to be &s;en&s;ible of her Mi&s;take, I hope <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> you don't look on her as lo&s;t, <HI>they go far indeed that never return.</HI></P>

<P>I know the Sub&s;tance of the Breach, but I never knew the la&s;t Part; I was going once or twice to talk of it to her, but I found it di&s;order|ed her, and &s;et her into a Fit of crying; and I am unwilling to di&s;compo&s;e her.</P>

<P>Why Si&s;ter; you know the Story it &s;elf, and upon what the Difference began, <HI>(viz.)</HI> about re&s;training her, and her Brother from going to the Park a Sabbath Days, going to the Play, and reading Plays <HI>and the like;</HI> and you have heard how the fir&s;t Sabbath Day after this Thing was de|bated among us, <HI>when her Father began that happy Reformation in his Family, which ble&s;&s;ed be GOD is &s;trictly kept up to this Day,</HI> &s;he and her Brother contrived to go out of the Way; <HI>we thought in|deed</HI> they had gone to the Park in Defiance of their Father, <HI>and my Heart aked I confe&s;s for them,</HI> for their Father was &s;o provoked at the thought of it, that he had re&s;olved they &s;hould neither of them have ever come into his Hou&s;e again, till they had humbled them&s;elves, and acknowledged
<PB N="302" REF="307">
<HI>both their Sins again&s;t GOD,</HI> and their Contempt of their Father; and he had ordered all the Ser|vants to keep them out if they came to the Gate, till they called him to them; but <HI>happily for us all,</HI> they were it &s;eems only walking <HI>in the Lime-tree Walk</HI> behind our Garden; and ju&s;t as we were en|quiring about it, they appeared walking <HI>together</HI> thro' the Garden entirely ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed: However their Father not fully &s;atisfied, before they came in, went to them him&s;elf into the Garden, and &s;trictly examined them about it: As they had the good Hap to &s;atisfie their Father, that they had been no further than <HI>the Lime-trees,</HI> &s;o they &s;atisfied them&s;elves, by &s;eeing their Father in the greate&s;t Rage they had ever known him in; <HI>I &s;ay they &s;atisfied them&s;elves</HI> of what they had to expect, <HI>if it had been otherwi&s;e;</HI> and this put them upon reflecting what Cour&s;e they had to take; where <HI>Dear Si&s;ter,</HI> who can but ob&s;erve, That in all their Con&s;ultations, GOD did not give them the Grace once to think of &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to their Father, and conforming them|&s;elves to the mo&s;t rea&s;onable De&s;ire that ever Fa|ther made to his Children, <HI>(viz.) only to re&s;train wicked Liberties and Company, and attend the Wor|&s;hip of GOD in the Family;</HI> but on the contrary, for Five Weeks, that they &s;tay'd at Home, <HI>after that,</HI> they never appeared at Prayer Time, but kept up Stairs, pretending either not to be well or not dre&s;&s;ed, or not up, and &s;uch like Excu&s;es, till they were a Shame to the whole Family: And be&s;ides this, their Father ob&s;erved, That notwith|&s;tanding his expre&s;s Command, they went both of them twice to the Play Hou&s;e the very &s;ame Week, as if on Purpo&s;e to in&s;ult him, and let him &s;ee, they valued not what he either &s;aid, or would &s;ay to them.</P>

<P>I am &s;ure he had done him&s;elf Ju&s;tice, <HI>Si|&s;ter;</HI> but I con&s;idered their Good more than they did them&s;elves, and that to have ca&s;t them entire|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y off, had been to precipitate their Ruin, and throw them into the very Mouth of all Manner of Temptation; and repre&s;enting this to their Fa|ther, it convinced him <HI>&s;o far,</HI> as not to proceed to that Extremity with them; but he had told them in &s;o many Words by me, That &s;ince they had de|clined his Authority, he would decline their Con|ver&s;ation; that tho&s;e that would not join with him in his Duty to GOD, &s;hould not enjoy with him the Bounty of GOD, and they that would not kneel with him to pray, &s;hould not &s;it with him to eat; and &s;o he flatly forbad them his Sight.</P>

<P>You may be &s;ure it could not hold long thus, and at be&s;t it made a very melancholy Fa|mily among us; at la&s;t <HI>my Son truly</HI> came to his Father, and in few Words told him he was &s;orry he had di&s;obliged him &s;o much, but as he &s;aw no Remedy, <HI>he told his Father,</HI> he came to ask his Con&s;ent to a Re&s;olution he had taken to Travel: <HI>His Father</HI> &s;aid readily, there was no need for his Con&s;ent, if it was a Re&s;olution, he &s;uppo&s;ed he Father came to take his Leave of him; the fooli&s;h Boy, <HI>for tho' he is a Man in Growth, he &s;hewed the Boy and the Fool in his Behaviour,</HI> told his Father he was re&s;olved to go, but had rather have his Con&s;ent than not.</P>

<P>Truly, he was not &s;o provoked at it, as I thought he would ha' been; I mean, it did not throw him into a Pa&s;&s;ion; he retired into his Clo|&s;et, and in an Hour or two came down again com|po&s;ed in his Temper, but I could &s;ee <HI>like that of Job,</HI> his Grief was great; and indeed from that Time, I thought it my Duty rather to comfort my Husband, than my Daughter: While &s;he con|tinued ill, he was very unea&s;y, and impatient; but when &s;he recovered again, he was better &s;atis|fied, and thought le&s;s of her: Our next Con&s;ide|ration was, what was to be done with her; for our Family look'd very odly; we had Authority quite turned up Side down among us; in&s;tead of her Father refu&s;ing to be reconciled to her, <HI>who had been the guilty Per&s;on, and had provoked him to the utmo&s;t,</HI> truly &s;he pretends Re&s;entment, and refu&s;es to be reconciled to her Father.</P>

<P><HI>Well,</HI> I am per&s;waded the &s;ooner &s;he mar|ries my Son in-Law, the &s;ooner &s;he will be brought to Repentance; I am &s;atisfied, he will be no hin|drance to her in the way of her Duty.</P>

<P>My Difficulties are ju&s;t and honourable: It &s;hall never be &s;aid, that I fir&s;t turned my Daughter out of Doors, and then let him marry her: <HI>It is in Ju&s;tice</HI> to him, that I &s;ay all this; had &s;he been de&s;erving and dutiful, and were I not &s;atisfied in my Con&s;cience, that &s;he will be his Ruin, I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much, nor made the lea&s;t Objection to the Propo&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>The Second DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>AS in the former Dialogue, when the Aunt came to treat of a Marriage for the Daughter, we had of Cour&s;e the Mother telling us the Hi&s;tory of the Conduct of her Son and Daughter, <HI>af|ter their coming home from the Garden from their Walk under the Lime-Trees,</HI> to the Time that both of them <HI>&s;o rudely</HI> left their Father: So in this Di|alogue which is between the <HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> we &s;hall from their own Mouths, have an Account of the Mea&s;ures they both took afterwards; <HI>fir&s;t as to her Part,</HI> till ju&s;t before &s;he went to be married, and &s;econdly as to his Part till ju&s;t before he went into the Army, and to his Travels <HI>as he called them.</HI> What became of both afterwards, we &s;hall &s;ee in a Part by it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>The Brother</HI> being now preparing for his Journey or Voyage, and the Si&s;ter for her Wedding, they mutually de&s;ired to conver&s;e together about tho&s;e Things before they went on; and the Brother making his Si&s;ter a Vi&s;it, their fir&s;t Conver&s;ation produces the following Dialogue.</P>
<STAGE>The Si&s;ter begins <HI>with a Sigh.</HI></STAGE>

<PB N="319" REF="324">
<SPEAKER>Bro,</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly &s;o we are; we look like Two Ex|iles, or People rather gone into voluntary Bani&s;h|ment from their own Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you: I have thought rather we are like Two Malecontent Courtiers, who being di&s;gu&s;ted at the Treatment they have received, <HI>have left the Court,</HI> and de&s;ire to retire <HI>as they call it</HI> into the Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;o too; and I believe it is with them <HI>as it is with us,</HI> or with me at lea&s;t, that they generally wi&s;h they had not done it after|wards.</P>

<P>Why; do you repent then?</P>

<SP>

<P><HI>I don't &s;ay I repent;</HI> I think I have been ill u&s;ed, and that I gave no Rea&s;on for &s;uch violent Treatment; but I cannot &s;ay I am glad it has hap|pened; there are many Things which make my pre&s;ent Condition le&s;s plea&s;ant to me, than it was before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>if you repent,</HI> why don't you go Home as the Prodigal did? No doubt the old Man would kill the Fatted Calf to have you again.</P>

<P><HI>Ay,</HI> but I an't come to Feeding of Hogs yet, and eating of Husks; I don't know what I might do if it were come to that.</P>

<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>not &s;o well neither;</HI> for <HI>to go back to your Court &s;imily,</HI> the di&s;contened Courtier retires to his E&s;tate in the Country, and <HI>there</HI> he can live

very well; <HI>but &s;till</HI> Five or Six Thou&s;and Pounds a Year at Court, made a very good Addition, and made him a great deal better; &s;o that he is always a Lo&s;er by quitting his Po&s;t, <HI>and &s;o it is with me Si&s;ter:</HI> If I had &s;tayed with my Father, or gone abroad with his Con&s;ent, I had been &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at his Expences, or perhaps travelled at his Charge; and then my own E&s;tate would have encrea&s;ed; be&s;ides my Father &s;ure <HI>would not ha' Di&s;inherited me for no other Crime, but meerly having a little E&s;tate of my own:</HI> But now I &s;uppo&s;e he has done with me entirely; and what's my E&s;tate compa|red to living like a Gentleman.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Dream a Thou&s;and Things not worth Naming, but however one Dream was &s;o parti|cular, I cannot but tell it you, tho' perhaps you'll banter me for it too; but I'll tell it you, becau&s;e you were a little concerned in it, and acted a Part in it.</P>

<P>But what's that to your Dream?</P>

<P>Why, the &s;ame Night that I had bought my Commi&s;&s;ion, I had this <HI>ugly Dream,</HI> It &s;eemed to me, that I had been &s;ome Time in the Army, and had met with many Wounds and Misfortunes; But at la&s;t I had one of my Arms &s;hot off, and had been a long while under Cure and Sick, &s;o that I was reduced to a meer Skelleton.</P>

<P><HI>Yes, yes,</HI> you were married, kept your Coach, and lived gallantly; you came to me very chearful and gay, but very grave in your Carriage; you told me you were very &s;orry for my Condi|tion, but you were &s;en&s;ible we had both been in the Wrong, and had pulled down the heavy Judg|ment of GOD upon me, by our Di&s;obedient Car|riage to our Father.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I ask'd you,</HI> why my Father carried it &s;o &s;evere to me <HI>now,</HI> when he &s;aw me in that Con|dition; <HI>you &s;aid</HI> I might remember my Father had &s;olemnly engag'd him&s;elf; that if I went away I &s;hould never &s;et my Foot within his doors again, but as a Penitent; and unle&s;s he was &s;atisfied that I acknowledged my Error, I could not expect he would break tho&s;e Engagements; nor would he &s;ee me, till he had an An&s;wer to it in po&s;itive Terms; <HI>I asked you</HI> how then he came to be re|conciled to you, <HI>for his Re&s;entment was equal at us both,</HI> and we were both in the &s;ame Fact.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and what &s;aid I to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

a Thou&s;and Times: That you were &s;en&s;ible we had both offended God, and abu&s;ed the Ten|derne&s;s of the be&s;t of Fathers, and you never had done an Action which gave you &s;o much Peace in your Life, as when you came upon your Knees to my Father, and begged his Pardon in the Face of all the Family, and if I had any Sen&s;e of Re|ligion, or of Natural Duty, <HI>you hoped</HI> I would do &s;o too, and that you came on Purpo&s;e to per&s;wade me to it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him <HI>very plainly,</HI> I would not be &s;o much in Debt to any Husband, as to have him take me without a Portion? I would not put it in|to a Husband's Power to reproach me with having had nothing with me.</P>

<P>Why after he had Two or Three Times propo&s;ed Marriage to me, and my Aunt had pre&s;|&s;ed me to a &s;erious Con&s;ideration of it: I took the Liberty to &s;peak my Mind very freely to him <HI>one Night,</HI> and to her too: <HI>In &s;hort,</HI> I made my Aunt downright angry with me; but I could get nothing from him, but what I confe&s;s was kinder, than <HI>as I told him,</HI> I ever intended to de&s;erve; and what
<PB N="327" REF="332">
was &s;o very obliging, that I confe&s;s I think my &s;elf very rude to him, <HI>I wonder he could bear it.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> I u&s;ed him ill enough for all that; I asked him fir&s;t, if he knew the Occa&s;ion of my being at their Hou&s;e? <HI>He &s;aid</HI> yes he did: <HI>I told him,</HI> I did not believe it.</P>

<P>That was rude indeed; it was unmannerly <HI>Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No,</HI> I was not rude that Way neither; I did not give him the Lye, but I went on <HI>imme|diately,</HI> I told him, That he might perhaps know that it was a Breach between my Father and me, but did not &s;uppo&s;e <HI>as I did,</HI> That it was a Breach that was impo&s;&s;ible ever to be made up; <HI>he look'd a little &s;urpriz'd at that,</HI> and &s;aid nothing; but my Aunt took me up &s;hort, and &s;aid, <HI>don't &s;ay &s;o Niece, I hope it &s;hall ea&s;ily be made up:</HI> No Madam <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> it can never be made up; I thought you all went upon a wrong Notion, and therefore it was that <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I did not believe it, when Mr. &mdash; &s;aid he knew the Affair of the Breach.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why,</HI> I told them plainly, my Father thought me guilty of an unpardonable Fault, and I thought my &s;elf guilty of no Fault art all. My Father thought me <HI>di&s;obedient,</HI> and I thought him <HI>unnatural:</HI> My Father had vowed never to receive me without Repentance, and I had re&s;olved ne|ver to repent; and &s;o it was impo&s;&s;ible we could be reconciled.</P>

<P>It was &s;o, <HI>and moved me &s;o much the other Way,</HI> That I went to her immediately, and ki&s;t her, and asked her Pardon, for being &s;o rude to her, and would have kneeled, but &s;he would not let me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And was the young Gentleman there to &s;ee all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes he was;</HI> and then it was, That as I &s;aid, he behaved &s;o very obligingly to me; he told his Mother, for he &s;eemed to &s;peak <HI>to her</HI> rather than to me, That he had found out a Way effectually to reconcile my Father and me, if I would approve of it: I told him I could not but approve of any rea&s;onable Way to be reconciled to my Father; for no body could &s;uppo&s;e it was plea|&s;ant to me to be turned out of my Father's Hou&s;e; be look'd upon like a Vagabond, and having no Fortune or Sub&s;i&s;tance, be left to go to Service, or be kept as it were upon Charity. He turned &s;hort to me upon this, and &s;aid, you know Ma|dam, the Offers of Marriage I have made to you; your Aunt <HI>my Kind Mother here,</HI> knows I am &s;in|cere in the Propo&s;al; if you accept me, let all the Breach lye on me: if when your Father and I de|bate it, he in&s;i&s;ts that you are in the wrong, I'll ask him Forgivene&s;s in your &s;tead, and I doubt not to prevail upon him to accept of it; if you do not appear in the wrong, and yet he &s;hould be ob|&s;tinate, I'll endeavour to make up the Lo&s;s of a Fa|ther to you, by doing every Thing I can to make you forget the Affliction that is pa&s;t, and I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall never enquire whether he will give you any Portion or no.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it po&s;&s;ible for you to An&s;wer any Thing to &s;o kind a propo&s;al, when made in &s;uch &s;erious Terms? certainly you could not Banter him than Si&s;ter as you did before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No I did not Banter him, <HI>I an&s;wered him thus;</HI> I told him that his Offer was too much for him to make, and too much for me to refu&s;e with|out an Apology for not making him a &s;uitable re|turn; but that he and I yet differed about the main Que&s;tion, <HI>(viz.) What it was my Father and I parted about,</HI> and perhaps he and I &s;hould part about the &s;ame: For if before hand I knew that he was again&s;t my Part, then he was not able to be an Advocate; but only took upon him to bear the Ignominy of a Submi&s;&s;ion for me; which was a Work I was not willing to put upon him, and a Debt I was not willing to owe him: That I had <HI>too much</HI> Re&s;pect for him to &s;uffer him to do the fir&s;t, and <HI>too little</HI> to Load my &s;elf with the Obli|gation of the la&s;t. That on the other Hand, if he ju&s;tified me, and believed my Father in the Wrong, all the Thoughts of reconciling of my Father were at an End. That as to taking me without it, I told him <HI>as I told you ju&s;t now,</HI> That I &s;eemed a fitter Match for one of his Father's Foot-men, than for <HI>his Father</HI>'s <HI>elde&s;t Son;</HI> and had too much Re&s;pect for the Family, to fill up &s;uch a Place, upon &s;uch mean Conditions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he might have an&s;wered all that, <HI>by telling you,</HI> he took all that Part upon him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did &s;o, <HI>and told me</HI> he would make the &s;ame Settlement upon me, as if I had my Fa|ther's Ble&s;&s;ing and a Portion: and he would apply him&s;elf for both afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could you &s;ay to that?</P>

<SP>

<P>I turned then to my Aunt, for this was a publick Communing, <HI>it was no Court&s;hip at all.</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="336">
I asked her thus, Madam there is another impo&s;|&s;ibility in the Way, that you know of, which really ought to prohibit my &s;peaking it, and that is this: Tho' this Breach happened between my Father and me, and I &s;eem now, <HI>as it were,</HI> to be out of his Government; <HI>yet I do not think my &s;elf at Liberty by it, to di&s;po&s;e of my &s;elf without his Leave or Con&s;ent, or at lea&s;t without asking it: If upon any &s;uch Motion he An&s;wers,</HI> Let her do what &s;he plea&s;es, as &s;he has put her &s;elf out of my Care, &s;o &s;he &s;hall be out of my Concern; <HI>if he &s;ays &s;o indeed, I &s;hall know then what I have to do;</HI> but <HI>till &s;uch</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>An&s;wer is obtained from my Fa|ther, I don't think the Que&s;tion ought &s;o much as to be asked of me, at lea&s;t if it be, I ought to give no other An&s;wer to it.</HI></P>

<P>No indeed; and he would not either, I dare &s;ay.</P>

<P>He &s;aid what was <HI>like him&s;elf,</HI> very o|bliging; he told me, <HI>That now I laid a double Af|fliction upon him, for I made him that was willing to do any thing in the World, to bring about my Return to my Father, be the only Ob&s;tacle in the way of it;</HI> I told him he knew how to remove that Ob&s;tacle very ea&s;ily, which was by thinking no more of

me; and perhaps in Time I might &s;ee my Mi&s;take, and by my Aunt's Mediation make my Peace with my Father; or my Father might abate his rigo|rous Humour, and it might go off again without it; or if neither happened, as I was not a Wife fit for a Gentleman, and was too proud to take up with a Footman, I was in no ha&s;te, I could remain as I was.</P>

<P>Why Child, your Difference with your Father as I under&s;tand it, was that when he &s;et up the Wor&s;hip of GOD in his Family, you would not join with him: but made a Scoff at his Re&s;olution of reforming his Family, and &s;everal &s;uch Things.</P>

<P>Did I not &s;ay <HI>Madam,</HI> That I believe Mr. &mdash; and you al&s;o, had not had a fair Account of the Thing: I cannot wonder <HI>Ma|dam,</HI> that you thought me in the wrong, I won|der Mr. &mdash; could think of me for a Wife, if I had been &s;uch a Daughter.</P>

<P>Come Child undeceive me then, and let me hear it all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Madam</HI> let me only let you hear it Right: My Father and Mother had bred up me and my Brother as you know, till we were come to be what we call Men and Women: We had been u&s;ed to Company, to good Manners, to Conver&s;e in the World with People of Qua|lity and good Breeding; and were come to an Age, in which we might be thought fit to be
<PB N="337" REF="342">
tru&s;ted with &s;o much of the Government of our &s;elves, as to be pa&s;t Schooling and Tutelage: We made no other u&s;e of tho&s;e Liberties than became a mode&s;t Behaviour; they can charge us with nothing Criminal or Scandalous: No Vice, nothing injurious to our Reputation; when all of a &s;udden without any Notice, we were fallen up|on, abridged of all lawful Liberties, were to have new Lectures of Family Di&s;cipline read to us, which we were ab&s;olutely to &s;ubmit to, and to commence Children again; <HI>This you may be &s;ure we thought hard,</HI> and my Share was immediately to fall under Correction; for my Mother, with|out any Provocation, <HI>as I thought,</HI> flew to my Clo|&s;et, took away all my Books, and flung them in the Fire, and laid her Hands upon me into the Bargain; this I thought <HI>at my Age</HI> was unrea&s;ona|ble U&s;age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Child, but <HI>you &s;ay</HI> you made no ill u&s;e of your Liberties; whereas you went every LORD's Day abroad to the Park, and a vi&s;iting; you went, every Day (almo&s;t) to the Play, &s;pent your time at home in playing at Cards, reading Plays, and the like.</P>

<P>It is true <HI>Madam</HI> we did &s;o; but we did not reckon the&s;e unlawful Liberties <HI>Madam,</HI> nor <HI>do I yet</HI> think &s;o.</P>

<P>But Madam <HI>if they were &s;o,</HI> who gave us the Example? Who bred us up in that Liber|ty? Did not <HI>my Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> always go out with us to the Park a Sundays? and go with us to the Play? Nay, did they not lead us into it by their Example! and did not my Mo|ther give me mo&s;t of tho&s;e very Books &s;he threw in the Fire, <HI>out of her own Clo&s;et!</HI> if this was a

<P><HI>My Child;</HI> they own they were in the wrong, <HI>and that is their Grief;</HI> I have heard them expre&s;s them&s;elves with Tears and a ju&s;t Sor|row on that Account: And they are forward enough to charge them&s;elves with it, as the Cau&s;e of all the Ob&s;tinacy of you and your Brother in re&s;i&s;ting their mea&s;ures of Reformation; and you &s;hould not Reproach them <HI>my dear</HI> with what they repent of.</P>

<P>I do not Reproach them, perhaps they have Cau&s;e for their Repentance; <HI>but &s;till</HI> it may be allowed for a Rea&s;on again&s;t their &s;o violently driving us into their new Mea&s;ures; and breaking us off from all our Friends and Society <HI>at once:</HI> without any other Rea&s;on, but that they thought fit to have it &s;o; <HI>if we had been little Children,</HI> it had been another Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I cannot but be again&s;t you <HI>Cou&s;in</HI> in it, tho' that part may &s;eem hard to you; for if the Thing was nece&s;&s;ary and ju&s;t, you could not ju&s;tify &s;o great a Breach with your Father and Mother for the manner of it.</P>

<P>Why if you were married to my Son &mdash; would you refu&s;e to have him pray to GOD in his Family, or to join with him if he did? <HI>indeed Cou&s;in</HI> I love you very well, <HI>but I have &s;o much Re&s;pect for him al&s;o,</HI> and above all &s;o much Zeal for the keeping up the Face of Religi+on in Families, that I could not in Con&s;cience b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the match.</P>

Did I omit going to Church with my Father? or do I omit it here? you are &s;atisfied I knew the Orders of your Family before I came hither. <HI>This makes it plain</HI> it was not that made the Di&s;pute, but the manner of his Acting, and abridging us of all tho&s;e Liberties he had bred us up in, and then beginning a new Di&s;cipline, when he ought to have allowed us to be pa&s;t Di&s;cipline: why had he not without all that Ceremony, and tho&s;e Severities upon us, called his Family to Prayers and called us in, do you think Madam we would have run away, or have left our Father becau&s;e of his going to Prayers?</P>

<HEAD>The Third DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE two la&s;t Dialogues are to be un|der&s;tood to be a Recapitulation of what had been acted &s;ome time pa&s;t, in order to introduce this part, and pre|&s;erve the Connection of the Hi&s;tory. The Daughter is now to be talked of, as having been married &s;ome Time. The Son was gone to Travel, and having been returned into <HI>Flanders,</HI> was gone to his Po&s;t in the Army, where being in the Confederate Service, and commanded out upon Action, he fell in with a Party of the <HI>French,</HI> and being very much wounded in the Fight, was taken Pri&s;oner and carried to <HI>Cambray;</HI> from whence he wrote his Si&s;ter a Letter, of which in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The new married Couple had for above two Years lived together, as they were at fir&s;t with his Father, and her Aunt; during which Time &s;he had had two Children, and the Treatment &s;he had met with there, had been &s;o kind, &s;o diverting and &s;o obliging, That &s;he could have no Rea&s;on to &s;ay that they had not perform'd fully the Engagement her Husband had made with her, to endeavour to make her forget the Affliction of the Breach with her Father.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="350">
Her Husband carried it with &s;o much Tenderne&s;s and Affection to her, as was capable to engage and win a Temper far more Refractory than hers; and by his obliging Carriage he prevented many little Excur&s;ions which her Inclination would otherways have led her too; yet two things remained, (1&s;t.) She could not per&s;wade her&s;elf to like a regular kind of Family Government; She loved Company, which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to, and a little to Play; and when &s;he made her Vi&s;its, would &s;ometimes &s;tay at Cards or other Diver&s;ions very late. (2d.) She could not bear to think of &s;tooping to own her Mis|behaviour to her Father, or to make any Submi&s;|&s;ion to him; nor could her Husband, tho' he failed in no Endeavour, bring that Breach to an End without it.</P>
<P>As her Family encrea&s;ed, and on the other Hand her Ways were not very agreeable to the Family &s;he was in, it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, to think of &s;ettling them&s;elves apart; and her Husband having a very good Hou&s;e of his own near the City, it was re|&s;olved they &s;hould do &s;o; and accordingly as we &s;ay, they began Hou&s;ekeeping.</P>
<P>And now began the Tryal of her Husband's Temper, and Patience to the utmo&s;t: The Ca&s;e was thus, Being now to be a Ma&s;ter of a Family, he was obliged to take upon him the Charge of Family Government; he had not only been religi|ou&s;ly educated, <HI>but as has been before ob&s;erved,</HI> was a very &s;erious religious Gentleman him&s;elf, it was his Affliction, that he found very little Compla|&s;ance in his Wife to any thing that was religious; and therefore he entred into no Conference with her about e&s;tabli&s;hing the Orders of his Family; but as &s;oon as his Hou&s;e was furni&s;hed, and his Family removed, he re&s;olved like a true Chri&s;tian to begin with the Wor&s;hip of God, in his Hou&s;e, and that he
<PB N="346" REF="351">
might leave no room to her to di&s;pute it, he did this without &s;o much as mentioning it to his Wife; as if it was a thing which it ought to be taken for granted, was as naturally and nece&s;&s;arily to be done in a Family, as providing Food and Conveniences for their Sub&s;i&s;tance; however as if to make this more Eligible, and to introduce it without any &s;eeming Impo&s;ition upon his Wife, he invited his Father and Mother, and a Mini&s;ter who was their Acquaintance to &s;up with them <HI>the fir&s;t Night of their Hou&s;ekeep|ing</HI> and before Supper, his Wife being in the Room, he askt the Mini&s;ter aloud, <HI>if he would plea&s;e to be their Chaplain for that Night?</HI> The Wife could not offer to oppo&s;e it, tho' he could ea&s;ily perceive &s;he look'd a little &s;trange at it; &s;o the Mi|ni&s;ter as had been concerted gladly accepting the Offer, Books were brought in, the Servants called together, and Family Prayers performed <HI>the fir&s;t Night:</HI> after this was done and Supper over, he in|vited the Mini&s;ter, <HI>who it &s;eems lived in the Country,</HI> to &s;tay two or three Days with him, which he al&s;o accepted; &s;o of Cour&s;e Prayers were had every Night and Morning while the Mini&s;ter &s;tay'd; and thus the Wor&s;hip of God was quietly introduced into the Family, and after the Mini&s;ter was gone, the Servants to whom it was no Novelty, having been all in the Family before, came of Cour&s;e toge|ther at the u&s;ual Hour, and he performed it him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>His Wife who was more di&s;gu&s;ted at his taking no notice of it to her, than at the thing it &s;elf; <HI>as if it was a beginning of &s;ome new Method which he intended to take with her,</HI> took a great many Ways to let him &s;ee &s;he was not very well pleas'd; &s;ome|times at the u&s;ual Time when he would &s;ay, <HI>Come call in the Servants.</HI> She would give a Smile as a Signal of Contempt; often &s;he would be bu&s;y above Stairs,
<PB N="347" REF="352">
and not come down at all; very often, tho' &s;he would come, &s;he would make him wait a good while; and when &s;he came into the Room, would &s;ay with &s;ome Di&s;dain, <HI>what need you ha' &s;taid for me.</HI></P>
<P>However <HI>he took no Notice of all this,</HI> and tho' &s;he &s;trove by all the Ways &s;he could to have made him &s;peak of it fir&s;t, yet he &s;hunned it; re&s;olving not to have any Di&s;pute with her, <HI>if it were po&s;&s;ible to avoid it;</HI> but &s;he &s;oon took Care to make it unavoid|able.</P>
<P>Being become now a Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Family, he hoped &s;he would have had &s;ome Con&s;ideration for the Station &s;he was in, and have appeared with a little of that Gravity and Authority that became her; but on the contrary &s;he intirely omitted all Appearance of any &s;uch thing; &s;he vi&s;ited oftner than ever; &s;he play'd at Cards abroad two or three Times a Week, and <HI>at home,</HI> as often as &s;he could get Company; &s;he went almo&s;t nightly to the Play, in &s;hort &s;he began to lead a Life &s;o different from the re&s;t of the Family, and &s;o unea&s;ie to him, and all his and her Friends, That it was greatly afflicting and perplexing to him.</P>
<P>During all this Time he treated her with the ut|mo&s;t Tenderne&s;s and the mo&s;t obliging Carriage that was po&s;&s;ible; only it could not be conceal'd neither from her, nor from all the Hou&s;e, that his Wife's Conduct was an extreme Affliction to him; <HI>and the more,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;aw no po&s;&s;ible method to go about to Reclaim her.</P>

<STAGE>(He withdraws and goes up Stairs.</STAGE>
<P>When her Husband was gone, and &s;he had &s;at a while, and mu&s;ed upon what &s;he had done; her Pa&s;&s;ion began to abate, and Rea&s;on to take Place again in her Soul; and fir&s;t her Unkindne&s;s to her Husband began to &s;hew it &s;elf to her; I be|lieve <HI>&s;ays &s;he to her &s;elf,</HI> I have anger'd him hear|tily; well it can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t be help'd now, let him <HI>ev'n take it if he will.</HI></P>
<P>But a little further thinking brought her more to her &s;elf, <HI>and then</HI> her Affection to him &s;tirred in her, and &s;he breaks out again. But <HI>why &s;hould I treat him thus? He never was unkind to me in his Life, he has been the tendere&s;t Husband that ever Woman had, and has taken me with Circum&s;tances ill enough, I'll go and heal it all again, take him in my Arms, and &s;peak kindly to him.</HI></P>
<P>Away &s;he goes to &s;peak to him, but cannot find him; &s;he enquires for him, the Servants &s;ay he is in his Clo&s;et; up &s;he flies thither, but he was come down again, and was gone out; then look|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng out at the Window, &s;he &s;aw him at a Di&s;tance
<PB N="362" REF="367">
walking very melancholly in &s;ome Fields near the Hou&s;e all alone by him &s;elf: By this Time &s;he was entirely come to her &s;elf, and &s;eeing him walk &s;o &s;olitarily, made her very unea&s;ie; &s;he &s;ends a Ser|vant to him, to tell him &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, and in hopes of his coming, &s;he run out into the Garden to meet him, but the Boy brought her Word again he was gone, and he could not find him.</P>
<P>Now &s;he began violently to reproach her &s;elf with her ill U&s;age of her Husband, and &s;hutting her &s;elf into her Chamber, &s;he reflected bitterly on her &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>What a Brute have I been</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>to the be&s;t Husband that ever Woman had: That took me with|out a Farthing Portion, when I was turned out of Doors by my Father and Mother; that never &s;aid an unkind Thing to me in his Life, that when I have lo&s;t</HI> 50 <HI>l. at a Time at Play, never &s;aid &s;o much as why did you do &s;o, or grudg'd parting with his Mo|ney?</HI> What barbarous Language have I given him! <HI>And how calmly and tenderly has he returned all along, without one unkind Word; &s;ure I am the ve|rie&s;t Brute of a Wife that ever any Man had! And don't de&s;erve that ever he &s;hould have the lea&s;t Value for me again.</HI> She &s;topt a while and wept vehe|mently, and then went on with her Exclamations upon her &s;elf thus.</P>
<P><HI>Then,</HI> what have I quarrelled with him for! <HI>but for what all the Women in the Nation but I, would value a Man for;</HI> (viz.) <HI>For his being &s;ober, and virtuous, and religious; and did ever a Fool talk to a Husband as I did, about his Family Orders! his Praying to GOD! and the like; why, my own Con&s;cience tells me that he is in the Right, and I am in the wrong, and tho' I mind nothing my &s;elf, I can|not but own he does well; &s;ure I am the wor&s;t Crea|ture</HI>
<PB N="363" REF="368">
<HI>alive! There are many Women and Men too, that have Religion little enough; but &s;ure never any Woman abu&s;ed a Husband for being better than them|&s;elves before!</HI></P>
<P>Here &s;he bur&s;t out into Tears again, and &s;till impatient; upon every little Noi&s;e &s;he heard in the Hou&s;e, to know if her Husband was come Home.</P>
<P>Her Husband had born all her Taunts with the utmo&s;t Patience as above, and had not withdrawn at la&s;t, but that he found him&s;elf moved by her talking irreligiou&s;ly and prophanely; when fear|ing he &s;hould fly out in a Pa&s;&s;ion too, and &s;o give her any indecent Language <HI>as &s;he did him,</HI> and which he thought him&s;elf obliged to avoid; <HI>he withdrew.</HI></P>
<P>He was however not only &s;urprized, but ex|tremely afflicted at this Treatment; and not only at this as an Accident, but at the &s;ad Pro&s;pect of what he was to expect from the Continuance of it; and that both as it re&s;pected the Conduct of her &s;elf abroad, which began to be publick; and al&s;o the Treatment he was to have from her at Home.</P>
<P>However, as the be&s;t Remedy for the Di&s;|order of his Pa&s;&s;ions, he went immediately in|to his Clo&s;et, and prayed earne&s;tly to GOD for a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Frame in him&s;elf to all his Providences; that he might not lay any Stre&s;s upon the In&s;trument, but view the Meaning and De&s;ign of Soveraign Goodne&s;s in all tho&s;e Things; <HI>not forgetting</HI> at the &s;ame time to Pray very &s;in|cerely for his Wife, That GOD would open her Eyes, convince her of her Sin, and bring her Home to him&s;elf, by a true Repentance and Re|formation.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="369">
This brought him to a perfect Compo&s;ure of Mind; and after &s;ome time &s;pent thus, he went out, and took a Walk in &s;ome Fields behind his Hou&s;e, where his Wife afterwards, <HI>as is noted a|bove,</HI> di&s;cover'd him from her Chamber Window; but before the Me&s;&s;enger &s;he &s;ent came thither, he was gone, having walked into the City; and as he went, he accidentally met with his Wife's Father, and going to take a Gla&s;s of Wine toge|ther, the following Di&s;cour&s;e happened between them.</P>

<STAGE>(They part, and the Young Gentleman goes Home to his Wife.</STAGE>
<P>His Wife had impatiently waited for his Re|turn; her Pa&s;&s;ion was entirely over, and her Af|fection to her Husband acting now as violently the other Way: She had afflicted her &s;elf exceeding|ly at his not coming Home: In &s;o much, That her Grief put her very much out of Order, and &s;he had thrown her &s;elf down upon a Couch in her Chamber; but had ordered her Servants not to fail to call her as &s;oon as their Ma&s;ter came in.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he came in, <HI>which was later than his u&s;ual Time,</HI> and upon enquiring for his Wife, was told by the Servants, that &s;he was very ill, he ran directly up Stairs into her Chamber before any Body could give her Notice of his being come; <HI>but the</HI> who li&s;tened too attentively to want a Me&s;|&s;enger, heard him coming up Stairs, and ra&s;ing ha&s;tily off the Couch, &s;he ran to the top of the
<PB N="372" REF="377">
Stairs to him, and taking him violently in her Arms, <HI>My Dear!</HI> Says She, <HI>Forgive me,</HI> That <HI>I have ungratefully in&s;ulted, and ba&s;ely provoked the tendere&s;t Husband, and the be&s;t Temper in the World.</HI> Tears choked her Words, and &s;he could &s;ay no more, and having ri&s;en up and run cro&s;s the Room too ha&s;tily, the Violence of that Motion, and of her own Pa&s;&s;ions overcame her, and &s;he fainted.</P>
<P>He called out for Help, and the Servants imme|diately running in, &s;he was carried back to her Chamber, and in &s;ome &s;hort time &s;he came to her &s;elf again; but finding her Husband &s;itting by her, and very anxious for her, it renewed her Grief, and made her for &s;ome Time unable to ex|pre&s;s her &s;elf freely.</P>
<P>When &s;he was entirely recovered, and fit to conver&s;e, <HI>&s;he ordered the Servants to withdraw;</HI> and then with Abundance of Tears &s;he acknow|ledged <HI>to him</HI> how &s;en&s;ible &s;he was, That &s;he had u&s;ed him ill; and that &s;he had not behaved her &s;elf as became her, in any of her Carriage to him; how afflicted &s;he had been at his Ab&s;ence &s;o long, believing that &s;he had exa&s;perated him, and grieved him, and in &s;hort a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he would endeavour to make him amends by a quite different Behaviour to him, all her Life after.</P>
<P>The Grief he had conceived at her &s;wooning away, and the Surprize of it, together with the Extreme of Joy he felt within him&s;elf at her declaring her Re&s;olutions of altering her Conduct, cau&s;ed him to &s;peak little to her, except what he thought proper to Comfort her, till &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him by often repeating &s;uch Que&s;tions, as the&s;e, <HI>My Dear do you forgive me?</HI> Are you not <HI>Angry?</HI> Were you not <HI>very Angry?</HI> and the

</SP>
<P>The Wife had no Gue&s;s at what he meant by this, and therefore made no Reply; but his Joy at her An&s;wer proceeded from this, That he knew the Change was wrought in her that very Time; nay as near as he could gue&s;s the very Moments that he, <HI>as is noted before,</HI> was earne&s;tly Praying to GOD, not only to give him Patience to bear the Affliction, but in his own Time to open her Eyes to her Duty, convince her of her Sin, and bring her to a &s;incere Repentance; <HI>vide Page</HI> 382, and this was an un&s;peakable Comfort to him.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="379">
This affected him &s;o much, That as &s;oon as he could po&s;&s;ibly leave his Wife, he retired to his Clo&s;et, and with great Thankfulne&s;s and Joy, gave Prai&s;es to the Divine Goodne&s;s for this Be|ginning of Mercy, not forgetting earne&s;tly to Pray, That GOD would be plea&s;ed to carry on this Work, to a thorow awakening the Con&s;ci|ence of his Wife, and bringing her to a Sen&s;e of her Duty to GOD, and to &s;incere Repentance for her former Errors; in which how he was heard, and how effectually he was an&s;wered, will appear in the following Part of this Work.</P>

<P>Her Husband told her, he was very glad to hear her &s;ay &s;o much, That it had layn much upon his Mind, to mention it to her, <HI>but that he was loath to grieve her,</HI> but he hoped that as GOD had been plea&s;ed to make her &s;en&s;ible of the Evil of it, &s;o he would, <HI>as of old in the Ca&s;e of the great Penitent David,</HI> no &s;ooner give her a Re&s;olution to confe&s;s the Sin, but add the Comfort of his Pardon. <HI>I &s;aid, I will confe&s;s my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion unto the LORD, and thou forgave&s;t the Iniquity of my Sin.</HI></P>
<P>She look'd up with a kind of a Smile at the&s;e Words, and &s;aid GOD will for give me <HI>my dear,</HI> tho' my Father won't; at which her Husband &s;aid, <HI>my Dear,</HI> if GOD forgive us, it is not &s;o much to us, if others do not; but I dare &s;ay if thy <HI>Father</HI> heard thee, he would not wait for any farther Acknowledgment; &s;hall I let him know it &s;aid her Husband, I know his Heart mourns for thee: <HI>My Dear,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I am in an ill Condition to ask him Forgivene&s;s now, but <HI>if he was here,</HI> I would do it as well as I could with all my Heart; and here her Tears again interrupting her, &s;he &s;aid no more.</P>
<P>Her Husband found it was not proper to &s;ay much more to her at that Time, her Di&s;temper being violent, &s;o he withdrew; &s;ecretly plea&s;ed to hear her &s;peak with &s;o much Earne&s;tne&s;s and Concern about her Father; and immediately &s;ent a Servant to her Father, with a Letter to tell him, he de&s;ired to &s;ee him in the Morning; and withal wrote &s;ome Account of the Occa&s;ion; the

Father tho' he took the News of her Illne&s;s very heavily, for he &s;till loved her very tenderly; yet received this Part of the Account with great Sa|tisfaction, and came early in the Morning to the Hou&s;e, where his Son-in-Law gave him an Account of all the Particulars of his Wi&s;e's Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But it was too late; for her Fever had en|crea&s;ed upon her with &s;o much Violence in the Night; That when her Father came into the Room, She was Speechle&s;s; and to all outward Appearance, at the very Point of Death.</P>
<P>Her Husband, tho' pa&s;&s;ionately afflicted at &s;o &s;ad a Sight; yet willing to give her all the Con&s;ola|tion he could, &s;poke clo&s;e to her Ear, That her Father was come, but &s;he did not &s;eem to take any Notice of it; her repeated it, adding he was come to give her his Ble&s;&s;ing, and a&s;&s;ure her that he had forgiven all the Breach between them; at which Words &s;he opened her Eyes, and look'd at her Father, but clo&s;ed them immediately, and remained &s;peechle&s;s; <HI>my Dear!</HI> &s;aid her Husband; <HI>give us a Sign if you under&s;tand us, would you have your Father forgive you?</HI> At which &s;he lifted up her Hand; <HI>and pray for thee,</HI> &s;aid her Husband! At which &s;he lifted up her Hand again, and ju&s;t open|ed her Eyes, <HI>but could not &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>This was a melancholly Sight, for two &s;uch near Relations to bear; nor did it afford any thing more, that &s;erves to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. The Father prayed by her Bed &s;ide, and gave GOD Thanks for any Appearances of Mercy to her Soul; and committing her into the Hands of her Redeemer they retired, expecting her departing every Moment.</P>
<P>But Providence had otherwi&s;e determined it, for tho' &s;he lay in that Condition two or three Days, yet it plea&s;ed GOD, <HI>after that,</HI> the Fe|ver

<P>The Tragical Part of this Story remains, and will make the Conclu&s;ion of this Work. The Subject is, the mi&s;erable wretched Ca&s;e of the Young Gentleman, the Brother to this Lady; and who had gone abroad as has been &s;aid, but was partly by his Wounds, Sickne&s;s, and Misfortune, but principally by his Vices and Extravagance, reduced to the la&s;t Extremity of Mi&s;ery; had wa&s;ted his E&s;tate, &s;old his Commi&s;&s;ion, lo&s;t one of his Arms, and was brought to the Nece&s;&s;ity of writing to his Father for Sub&s;i&s;tance, and for Mo|ney to bring him over to <HI>England;</HI> of which the Particulars will appear in the next Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>The Fifth DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the La&s;t Dialogue you have &s;ome Account of the Condition the Young Gentleman for|merly mentioned was reduced to, in a Let|ter to his Si&s;ter, dated from <HI>Cambray:</HI> where he was under Cure of his Wounds.</P>
<P>It &s;eems his Extravagance had reduced him to the la&s;t Extremity, and having had his Arm cut off, and falling into a long Fit of Sickne&s;s after it; tho' he was exchanged by Virtue of the Cartel for Exchange of Pri&s;oners, and &s;o had his Freedom; yet he could not be removed, and was at la&s;t obli|ged to &s;ell his Commi&s;&s;ion; after which, &s;eeing him&s;elf reduced to great Extremities, and the ut|mo&s;t Mi&s;ery, even of wanting Bread being in his View; he wrote a &s;econd Letter to his Father, which being brought by a Per&s;on, who gave a particular Account of his Condition; moved his Father to take Compa&s;&s;ion of him, and relieve him.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>The tender compa&s;&s;ionate Father, tho' he re|&s;ented his Son's Treatment of him deeply enough, and &s;teadily adhered to the Re&s;olution of never receiving him into his Family, unle&s;s he acknow|ledged his fir&s;t Crime, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of with&s;tanding the Reformation of his Father's Hou&s;e; yet being by no means obliged by that Re&s;olution, not to re|lieve him in Di&s;tre&s;s, or to let him &s;tarve in a &s;trange Country, having enquired into the Parti|culars of his Circum&s;tances, from the Gentleman who brought the Letter, and under&s;tanding by him that his Son was reduced to the utmo&s;t Di|&s;tre&s;s; he immediately remitted Money over to a Dutch Merchant at <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> with Orders to give him pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tance, and to bring him from <HI>Cambray</HI> thither, in Order to his being &s;ent over to <HI>England;</HI> all which the &s;aid Merchant effectu|ally performed, and the poor reduced Gentleman arrived at <HI>London</HI> &s;oon after.</P>
<P>It was the very &s;ame Day of his Arrival, when he cau&s;ed his Father to have Notice that he was coming to lay him&s;elf at his Door; but the Father tho' he had relieved him, and de&s;igned to take
<PB N="395" REF="402">
Care that he &s;hould not want, yet judging it need|ful to let him know that his Re&s;entments had been very ju&s;t; and that he was to be &s;atisfied further, with Relation to Things pa&s;t, before he could be re&s;tored to the State of an Elde&s;t Son, if ever that was to be done at all; gave him the Mortification of fignifying to him by a Me&s;&s;enger, That he was not to be admitted to &s;ee his Father, or to come into his Hou&s;e yet; but that he was to go to &s;uch a Place, not far off, where a Lodging was provi|ded for him.</P>
<P>This afflicted him extremely; at fir&s;t it threw him into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, expo&s;tulating with the Me&s;&s;enger in &s;uch Words as the&s;e, What! Has my Father brought me thus far, but to trample on my Mi&s;ery, and to make his Re&s;entment &s;ink the deeper; or has he brought me like a Criminal to the Place of Execution; thus, <HI>as he may think it</HI> to do Ju&s;tice upon me! Why had he not &s;uffered me to peri&s;h where I was, rather than come hi|ther to die with the more Affliction and Reproach? The Me&s;&s;enger told him his Bu&s;ine&s;s was not to di&s;pute with him, but to deliver his Me&s;&s;age; That he had no further In&s;tructions, And &s;o gi|ving the Coach Man Directions where to go, he told the poor Gentleman, he would go before to receive him, and took his Leave.</P>
<P>The unhappy Gentleman bid the Coach Man go on, and in a little Time he found him&s;elf pa&s;|&s;ing by his Father's Door; this &s;truck him with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief, even into an Agony of Shame, Anger, and De&s;pair; when in that very Moment his Dream came to his Mind, which he had related to his Si&s;ter; and which we have &s;et down in the fir&s;t Dialogue <HI>of this Part. (viz.) How that having his Arm &s;hot off, and being relieved by his Father abroad, and brought over; tho' he came</HI>
<PB N="396" REF="403">
<HI>to his Father's Door, yet he would not take him in, but had ordered him to a Neighbour's Hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As &s;oon as this revolved upon his Thoughts, it immediately quieted him, and he broke out into this Expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>Well!</HI> Now I &s;ee that no|thing befalls us without the determinate Will of that Soveraign Power that guides and go|verns the whole World: This was &s;o long ago repre&s;ented to me in a Dream; how exactly is every Step of it come to pa&s;s upon me! God is ju&s;t! and it is my Part to &s;ubmit.</Q></P>
<P>This quieted his Mind for &s;ome Time, and he went on to the Hou&s;e which his Father had ap|pointed him; where he found the Servant who <HI>as he had &s;aid</HI> went before; who helped him in, for he was &s;o weak, he could hardly go, and coming into a Chamber provided for him, <HI>fetching a deep Sigh,</HI> he threw him&s;elf on the Bed, without &s;peak|ing a Word; and in this Condition he remained all that Night, and Part of the next Day; no body coming to him, but the People of the Hou&s;e, who were however directed to attend him and &s;upply him with Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>In the Evening he heard a Coach &s;top at the Door; and &s;oon after a Lady coming up Stairs who was brought into his Chamber, and who he pre&s;ently knew to be his Si&s;ter; &s;he found him very weak, &s;itting in a Chair by the Fire, leaning his Head upon his Hand, and his Elbow on a Table that &s;tood by him; his Eyes fixed on the Ground; his Countenance to the la&s;t Degree dejected, pale, and thin; and in &s;hort as like a Spectre as any Thing that was real Fle&s;h and Blood could be &s;up|po&s;ed to be: As &s;he came forward into the Room, he lifted up his Eyes, and &s;aid only this Word, <HI>Si&s;ter!</HI> and would have ri&s;en up, but had not Strength; She de&s;igned to have embraced him, but

when &s;he &s;aw him, &s;he was frighted and amazed, and &s;at down over again&s;t him at &s;ome Di&s;tance, being ready to &s;woon away: At fir&s;t &s;he could hardly be convinc'd it was really her Brother; and when &s;he was &s;atisfied of that, the very &s;eeing him in that Condition, &s;truck her with &s;uch Grief, That &s;he could not &s;peak a Word to him for a great while.

<P><HI>Yes! yes!</HI> That is the De&s;ign! Why el&s;e had he not ordered me to &s;ome Ho&s;pital, or Place of Retreat?

<P>You cannot think &s;o hardly of my <HI>Father:</HI> You &s;hould rather conclude, that his bringing you &s;o near him, is in order to re&s;toring you entirely, and a little Patience would give you Light in that Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he &s;o much as given me the lea&s;t In|timation of it? On the contrary, has he not brought me to pa&s;s by his very Door, and &s;ent

<P>You &s;hould con&s;ider <HI>Brother,</HI> the Terms on which you &s;tand with my Father; with Re|&s;pect to your going away, and the Obligation he is under of expecting &s;ome Terms, before you are re&s;tored.</P>

<P>I know what you mean <HI>Si&s;ter;</HI> I could have made any Submi&s;&s;ions, had he not brought me thus, <HI>as it were upon a Stage,</HI> to be a Spectacle to all People: And make a private Breach become publick, by a &s;candalous Pennance: Now I can never do it, tho' I were much more convinced of the Crime than I am: It is impo&s;&s;ible! No I can|not do it! If I &s;tarve here!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Brother,</HI> do not talk of that, you &s;hall not &s;tarve: I have had too much Hand in your Mi&s;eries to &s;uffer you to &s;tarve, tho' my Fa|ther would; but you will not find <HI>my Faiher</HI> in|clines to any thing unkind: But <HI>Dear Brother</HI> you are I hope too &s;en&s;ible of the Mi&s;take we both committed, to be unwilling to give <HI>my Father</HI> that &s;mall Satisfaction he requires; which is but a bare Acknowledgment of having done ami&s;s. I have done it with the greate&s;t Sincerity, and with the greate&s;t Peace and Satisfaction to my &s;elf in the World; <HI>to tell you true,</HI> I had really no true Peace or Satisfaction till I did do it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Brother,</HI> it is very wonderful, and I have often thought on that Dream, and of my Aunt's Prediction al&s;o, about the &s;ame time, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That you would be brought to want Bread, and to beg my Father to relieve you; tho' I was in hopes it would never ha' come to that Pa&s;s.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Te&s;timony that <HI>nothing befalls us</HI> without an Invi&s;ible Hand; I acknowledge his Ju|&s;tice; but I cannot but think, that my Father is very &s;evere, and indeed very cruel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> you take the fir&s;t Part of this Affair, without the &s;ub&s;equent, which is in his De&s;ign; and which I hope will make all end well &s;till, if you can be per&s;waded to act with Temper and Patience.</P>

<P>That is upon Suppo&s;ition <HI>I perceive,</HI> That my Condition will oblige me to make the utmo&s;t Submi&s;&s;ions, meerly for want of Sub&s;i&s;tance, whe|ther I am &s;en&s;ible of the Crime or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Brother!</HI> I hope you are &s;en&s;ible of it: If &s;uch Judgments as you have met with, can|not make you &s;en&s;ible, nothing will! However as all your Dream is not come to pa&s;s, I &s;hall fulfill the re&s;t, by which be&s;ides my Re&s;pect to you, that Excu&s;e &s;hall be taken away, <HI>(viz)</HI> That you are nece&s;&s;itated to make Submi&s;&s;ions for Bread; I hope you will do it from a mere Sen&s;e of the Sin, and of God's Anger and Ju&s;tice, as well as of your Father's Di&s;plea&s;ure: And that you may not be in a Nece&s;&s;ity of doing it otherwi&s;e; take that Part

<P>If <HI>with my E&s;tate,</HI> I had lo&s;t all Sen&s;e of Honour, were grown as low &s;pirited, as I am low circum&s;tanced, I might cringe and &s;toop as a Beg|gar at a Door; but if my Father &s;eeks to &s;uppre&s;s the Soul, by the Afflictions of the Body, as it is more than cruel, <HI>in him;</HI> &s;o it is in&s;upportable to me, and I mu&s;t deliver my &s;elf <HI>Si&s;ter.</HI></P>

<P>Your Story is very remarkable! Indeed your Husband's Conduct mu&s;t be admired: But <HI>dear Si&s;ter,</HI> my Father did not deal with you, as he does with me; if he had, it would have fired your Spirits, and filled you with Indignation, ra|ther than have engaged you to an Acknowledg|ment.</P>

<P>What Mi&s;con&s;truction can it be? Am I not here? Was I not brought to his Door? Was I not &s;hut out, and turned here after Five Years Ab&s;ence? Has my Father or Mother, or any of the Family come, or &s;o much as &s;ent a Servant to &s;ee me?</P>

<P><HI>Why,</HI> the Servant you &s;ent, &s;urprized him, with telling him too ha&s;tily, that you had ordered him to a Lodging, and not to bring him Home: And then to encrea&s;e it, the Coach very unhappily drove by the Door here; and it grieved him &s;o much, to &s;ee him&s;elf brought to his Father's Door, and could not have Leave to come in; that he fell into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, the People &s;ay, he raged &s;o much all Night, <HI>tho' they knew not at what,</HI> That they were afraid he would de&s;troy him&s;elf; and he lays it &s;o to Heart &s;till, that it grieves me, I know not what to do for him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>She weeps.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard indeed that he flew out into a Pa&s;|&s;ion. The Fellow was a Fool to deliver his Me&s;|&s;age in&s;olently, and al&s;o to bring him by the Door;
<PB N="408" REF="415">
there was no need of it; but as for not coming in, he knew my Terms of his Return; and I know that he expected no other before he came over; but he might ea&s;ily think my bringing him hither, was in Order to receive him kindly, and make his Submi&s;&s;ions as cheap to him, as I could.</P>

<P>He would ha' &s;crupled no Submi&s;&s;ions I believe, if this had not happened.</P>

<P><HI>No really,</HI> he bid me &s;ay to you, That he is very &s;orry he has given you Offence, and e&s;pe|cially that he went away without your Leave, and that he will ask you Pardon with all his Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But Child,</HI> does he come to the main Point; will he acknowledge his Sin again&s;t GOD and his Father, in re&s;i&s;ting the ju&s;t Mea&s;ures taken for the Reformation of our Family, and his lea|ving the Hou&s;e upon that Account. For which I &s;olemnly declared to him, <HI>That if he went away upon that Score, he &s;hould never return, but as a Penitent.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dau.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope Sir, you will con&s;true his asking you Pardon in general, to contain all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;hould I con&s;true it <HI>Child,</HI> a Way that he does not declare it to be under&s;tood? For I have had &s;ome Information already, that he re|&s;olves the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dau.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in hopes <HI>Sir,</HI> he will not declare that, and I hope you will let his Condition plead a little for him; Mi&s;ery di&s;orders our Tempers, as well as our Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if his Mi&s;ery will not allow him to make &s;o ju&s;t an Acknowledgment, nor he will not free me from the Engagements which he knows I am under; it is <HI>he</HI> refu&s;es to come in, it is not I that &s;hut him out; it is a &s;ad Sign, if &s;o much Suffe|ring,

<P>I cannot &s;ay <HI>Sir,</HI> whether it may be better or wor&s;e; if he be in Temper, it mu&s;t needs be to his Advantage, to have you &s;ee him; but if his Di|&s;turbance at this Affair, is not over, tho' he be &s;o low reduced, I fear his ob&s;tinate Temper.</P>
</SP>

<P>What, does he think, That I take Occa&s;ion from his Mi&s;ery, to force him to a Submi&s;&s;ion?</P>

<P>I cannot &s;ay but <HI>&s;omething of that</HI> is upon his Mind.</P>

<P>Come then, I have a Thought of an Expe|dient to remove his Re&s;entment; for I will not leave him the lea&s;t Room to complain of me, nor indeed do I de&s;ire, or value a forced Submi&s;&s;ion; if GOD has not wrought a Change upon him by his Afflictions, it is not my forcing him that will do any good: If he makes any Acknowledgments from the Power of his pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities, they will be but Hypocritical and in&s;incere, and &s;uch a Kind of Penitence as will not be acceptable to GOD, I am &s;ure will be very un&s;atisfying to me.</P>

<P>Then <HI>tell him,</HI> he knows the Rea&s;on, why I cannot agree to take him Home; which Rea&s;on it is in his Power to remove when he plea&s;es; tell him that when he thinks fit to remove it effectu|ally, he &s;hall be received with as much Affection and Kindne&s;s as he can expect; but that it is be|low me to take Advantage of his Mi&s;ery to oblige him to that Submi&s;&s;ion, tho' I have good Rea&s;on to do &s;o: And that therefore I allow him to re|move, whether he plea&s;es to go for his Accomo|dation: And I will allow him 50 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for his Sub&s;i&s;tance; and there's 10 <HI>l.</HI> for him, for his pre&s;ent Supply: Thus he is left entirely free, either to comply with his Father, or not to com|ply with him, as GOD &s;hall plea&s;e to influence his Mind; he can complain of no Force or ill U|&s;age on my Side.</P>
