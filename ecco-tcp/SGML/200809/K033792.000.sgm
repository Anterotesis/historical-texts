KING DIONYSIUS AND SQUIRE DAMOCLES; A New Song on an Old Story. Proper to be &s;ung at all Fea&s;ts and Merry-makings.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE was a heathen man, &s;ir,</L>
<L>Belonging to a King;</L>
<L>And &s;till it was his plan, &s;ir,</L>
<L>To covet every thing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And if you don't believe me,</L>
<L>I'll name him if you plea&s;e,</L>
<L>For let me not deceive ye,</L>
<L>'Twas one Squire Damocles.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He thought that jolly living</L>
<L>Mu&s;t every joy afford,</L>
<L>And knew of no mi&s;giving,</L>
<L>While round the fe&s;tive board.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He wanted to be great, &s;ir,</L>
<L>And fed on fare delicious,</L>
<L>And have his fea&s;ts in &s;tate, &s;ir,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t like King Diony&s;ius.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King, to cure his longing,</L>
<L>Prepar'd a fea&s;t &s;o fine,</L>
<L>That all the Court were thronging</L>
<L>To &s;ee the Courtier dine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And there to tempt his eye, &s;ir,</L>
<L>Was fi&s;h, and fle&s;h, and fowl,</L>
<L>And when he was a-dry, &s;ir,</L>
<L>He had a brimming bowl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor did the King forbid him</L>
<L>From drinking all he could;</L>
<L>The Monarch never chid him,</L>
<L>But fill'd him with his food.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O then, to &s;ee the plea&s;ure</L>
<L>Squire Damocles expre&s;t!</L>
<L>'Twas joy beyond all mea&s;ure;</L>
<L>Was ever man &s;o ble&s;t?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With greedy eyes the Squire</L>
<L>Devour'd each co&s;tly dainty;</L>
<L>You'd think he did a&s;pire</L>
<L>To eat as much as twenty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ju&s;t as he prepar'd, &s;ir,</L>
<L>Of bli&s;s to take his &s;wing;</L>
<L>O, how the man was &s;car'd, &s;ir!</L>
<L>By this &s;o cruel King!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When he to eat intended,</L>
<L>Lo! ju&s;t above his head,</L>
<L>He &s;pied a &s;word &s;u&s;pended</L>
<L>All by a &s;ingle thread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How did it change the fea&s;ting</L>
<L>To wormwood and to gall,</L>
<L>To think, while he was ta&s;ting,</L>
<L>The pointed &s;word might fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then in a moment's time, &s;ir,</L>
<L>He loath'd the lu&s;cious fea&s;t;</L>
<L>And dreaded, as a crime, &s;ir,</L>
<L>The brimming bowl to ta&s;te.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, if you're for applying</L>
<L>The &s;tory I have told,</L>
<L>I think there's no denying</L>
<L>'Tis worth its weight in gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye gay, who view this &s;tranger,</L>
<L>And pity his &s;ad ca&s;e;</L>
<L>And think there was great danger</L>
<L>In Damocles's ca&s;e;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come let this aweful truth</L>
<L>In all your minds be &s;tor'd;</L>
<L>That DEATH o'er every youth</L>
<L>Hangs like a pointed &s;word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tho' you &s;ee no rea&s;on,</L>
<L>To check your mirth at all;</L>
<L>In &s;ome &s;ad drunken &s;ea&s;on</L>
<L>The &s;word on you may fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So learn, while at your ea&s;e</L>
<L>You drink down draughts delicious,</L>
<L>To think of Damocles,</L>
<L>And old King Diony&s;ius.</L>
