<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was not &s;o much the Succe&s;s of the former Volumes of the&s;e Let|ters, that has promoted their Con|tinuance; but the Excellence of the Subject, the Beauty of the Manner, and the delightful Variety they pre|&s;ent us with, convinc'd me that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble but they &s;hould plea&s;e.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible to give the Reader (in the Tran&s;lation) the &s;ame Ideas he would conceive, were he to read the Original; could I tran&s;late, or indeed could our Language expre&s;s the Story with the &s;ame Vivacity, the fame Spirit, and the &s;ame Energy of Words as the old exqui&s;itely qualified <HI>Arabian</HI> delivered it, how much &s;upe|rior would it be to what it now appears; with what Plea&s;ure, with what Raptures and Exta|fies mu&s;t it be received?</P>
<P>But 'tis not to be done: I may tran&s;late the Words, and I have &s;ome Hopes the Reader will &s;ugge&s;t that I have done my Duty; but to ren|der the &s;ublime Flights of the incomparable
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
<HI>Mohmut,</HI> his bright Ideas, his &s;urprizing Turns of Wit, and Flights of Fancy; I &s;ay, to render the&s;e exactly in our Language, is as difficult as 'tis for a Painter to repre&s;ent the Pa&s;&s;ions, or a Carver to make his Figures &s;peak.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erv'd by the Curious, that the mo&s;t difficult thing in the Limners Art is, to repre|&s;ent a Per&s;on &s;inging; &s;uppo&s;e it be the Pi|cture of a young Lady, the utmo&s;t he can do is, to &s;hew her Countenance bright, the Company li&s;tening, and appearing plea&s;ed; but alas to|wards the Sound, towards the Charm of her Voice, and the Beauty of her Judgment, he can do no more than paint her with her Mouth open, which is the meane&s;t Po&s;ture &s;he can, with Decency, be &s;hewn in; and unle&s;s the other Pa&s;&s;ions di&s;cover it, &s;he may as well be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;wearing, &s;colding, &s;ick, or any thing el&s;e, as well at &s;inging.</P>
<P>We can no more repre&s;ent the Eloquence, the Spirit, the &s;prightly Turns, and the happy Genius of our accompli&s;h'd, inimitable <HI>Arabi|an,</HI> by the mo&s;t laboured and &s;tudied Tran&s;la|tion into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than a Limner can paint the Voice, and give the Mu&s;ick of the Song in the Ge&s;tures of the Lady.</P>
<P>But when I have acknowledg'd this, the Reader, I hope, will not find that all the Care has been taken to make old <HI>Mahmut</HI> &s;peak <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> I &s;ay, all the Care that con&s;i&s;ts with one very &s;ollicitous to plea&s;e and oblige, as well as to divert and in&s;truct.</P>
<P>Above all, I have followed that &s;ure Rule in our Tongue, and which, were it ob&s;erved,
<PB N="v" REF="5">
would, I believe, be acknowledged to be the be&s;t Rule in all Tongues, <HI>(viz)</HI> to make the Language plain, artle&s;s, and hone&s;t, &s;uit|able to the Story, and in a Stile ea&s;ie and free, with as few exotick Phra&s;es and ob&s;olete Words as po&s;&s;ible, that the meane&s;t Reader may meet with no Difficulty in the Reading, and may have no Ob&s;truction to his &s;earching the Hi&s;tory of things by their being ob&s;cure|ly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>It was objected, I know, to the former Vo|lumes of this Work, that the <HI>Turk</HI> was brought in too much deba&s;ing the Chri&s;tian Religion, extolling <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and &s;peaking di&s;|re&s;pectfully of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, calling him the <HI>Nazaren,</HI> and the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> and it is certain the Continuation mu&s;t fall into the &s;ame Method; but either <HI>Mahmut</HI> mu&s;t be a <HI>Turk</HI> or no <HI>Turk,</HI> either he mu&s;t &s;peak his own Language or o|ther Peoples Language, and how mu&s;t we repre|&s;ent Words &s;poken by him in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of invincible <HI>Mahmut</HI> the <HI>Arabian,</HI> if we mu&s;t not give his own Language; and how can this Work be a Tran&s;lation, if we mu&s;t not tran&s;late the very Stile of the Original?</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who think they have Cau&s;e for any Ob&s;ervations of this Nature ob&s;erve, that all Care po&s;&s;ible is taken to repre&s;ent &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages in Terms that may give no Offence, and with this Caution to the Reader, that when he reads tho&s;e Parts, he is de&s;ired to take them as the Words of the <HI>Arabian,</HI> not the Words of the Tran&s;lator; and if any thing may be &s;aid to be left out of the Original, it can only be &s;uch Places where <HI>Mahmut</HI> may
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
have taken more Liberties than might be pro|per for the Repetition of Chri&s;tian Readers.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, it will be ob&s;erved, in Defence of the Tran&s;lation, and of the good Intention of the Tran&s;lator, that as hone&s;t <HI>Mah|mut,</HI> upon many Occa&s;ions, &s;peaks very ho|nourably, and even reverently of our Saviour, and particularly of the perfect Laws and Rules of Faith and Doctrine, and &s;peaks with Dete|&s;tation of the Apo&s;tacy of his Followers, and of the unworthy Behaviour of tho&s;e who pro|fe&s;s to be his Di&s;ciples and Wor&s;hippers; &s;o the Tran&s;lator has not fail'd to take all Occa|&s;ions to do Ju&s;tice to the Original in all tho&s;e Ca&s;es in particular.</P>
<P>It is true, the Tran&s;lator has &s;ome Letters on the&s;e Subjects which he has not thought fit to make publick, becau&s;e of the nice Pa|lates of a cen&s;orious Age, who will take all Advantages to in&s;ult the Publication of &s;uch a Stile, while yet they concern not them&s;elves to hear the Deity of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in&s;ulted every Day in publick, by tho&s;e who call them|&s;elves Believers, and even the Being of a God denied by a much wor&s;e Infidelity than that of a <HI>Mahometan.</HI></P>
<P>It is an Ob&s;ervation not unworthy the Re|mark of our <HI>Arabian,</HI> and may be very u&s;eful to tho&s;e that read him, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the practi|cal Athei&s;m, &s;o rife in the World in this Age, is a Sin engro&s;&s;ed among Chri&s;tians; that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> know nothing of it; and that it is not heard of among the Mu&s;&s;ulmans, that any Man &s;hould arrive to that Degree of Hardne&s;s
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
in Crime, as to deny the Being of a God, who&s;e Glory the Light of Nature &s;o evidently reveals.</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters are not only a Record of Hi|&s;tory through the Years they refer to, and that not only re&s;pecting <HI>France,</HI> but all the Parts of the Chri&s;tian World; but they are fruitful of improving Ob&s;ervations on many Subjects, as well Religious as Moral.</P>
<P>It is true, our <HI>Arabian</HI> grows ancient, and we find him ca&s;ting his Thoughts upon the Plea&s;ures of their <HI>Mahometan</HI> Futurity; but as Chri&s;tians &s;hould, when they grow nearer a future State, have their Minds ting'd with the Glories they expect; &s;o we find his Under&s;tand|ing &s;o far from a Decay by his Years, that he &s;peaks of religious things with &s;o much the more Reli&s;h and Ta&s;te, as if he realliz'd on Earth the Heaven he expected.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t have very few Thoughts about him who cannot &s;ee that the older our Author grows, the more profitable and in&s;tructing his Writings will be, and yet we do not find his Fancy &s;o confin'd, but that he ranges through all the Regions of Science, &s;peaks of the Po|liticks of State, and Progre&s;s of Armies, with as true Deductions and as clear a Judgment as ever.</P>
<P>If our Corre&s;pondent at <HI>Vienna,</HI> to whom <HI>Mahmut</HI> committed his Papers, and to whom they were faithfully delivered by his Succe&s;|&s;or, does not deceive us, we may expect a yet greater Variety, towards the Conclu&s;ion of his Re&s;idence, than has yet &s;een the Light, and
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
perhaps &s;ome Remains of things omitted in the Time of former Publication, which, as they come to Hand, &s;hall be communicated with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s, whether they may ex|actly corre&s;pond with the Chronology of for|mer Publications or no; and tho' there may &s;eem a little Confu&s;ion in &s;uch a Retro&s;pect, yet I doubt not the Beauty of the Subject &s;hall make full Amends for any Di&s;order in the Dates.</P>
<P>This has been the Rea&s;on why, even in this Volume, &s;ome Letters, e&s;pecially of &s;pecula|tive Subjects, may come a little out of the Order of Time, which, I think, is a thing of &s;o trifling a Nature, compar'd to the Advan|tage of their Publication, that it needs not the lea&s;t Apology for it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. To <HI>Mu&s;a Emo Saban Reis Effendi,</HI> or Secretary of State to the Grand Seignior.</HEAD>
<P>_THou ha&s;t formerly &s;een and approv'd my Letters to <HI>Cicala Ba&s;&s;a, Beglerbeg</HI> of <HI>Romania,</HI> and commande&s;t me to write al&s;o to thy &s;elf; approving, as thou &s;aye&s;t, my way of Inform|ing my Friends of the State of Things in this Country. It &s;olaces my Soul, in the mid&s;t of my langui&s;hing Di&s;temper, of which I inform'd the <HI>Chaimacam,</HI> my late Friend, and in which I had felt &s;o much pain; I &s;ay, it &s;olaces my Soul to find my performances approved by him, to whom I owe my Commi&s;&s;ion, and the being remembred, after having been forty and eight Years, as one buried alive, among Infi|dels, and Strangers.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="22">
But in particular it gives Youth to my Spi|rits, and fires my Soul with an inconceivable Joy, that thou give&s;t me the promi&s;e of &s;end|ing me a Succe&s;&s;or in this nice Employment, thereby giving me hopes of being recalled, that I may once more &s;ee my native Country, in which lie the Bones of my Father and Bre|thren, and where I &s;hall be able to die, as my Soul de&s;ires, even at the Gates of the thrice happy and ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Mecca;</HI> where lie the Re|mains of our mo&s;t holy Prophet, ever miracu|lous, and performing deeds of a&s;toni&s;hment to the Eyes of all tho&s;e who are allow'd to look three foot above the Ground on which they &s;tand.</P>
<P>I conjure thee, happy <HI>Saban,</HI> now thou art Exalted to the High Po&s;t of a publick Mini|&s;ter: I &s;ay, I conjure thee by the hoary Beard of thy Father and Grandfather; by the Faith of a <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman,</HI> and true Believer; by the Fire that de&s;cended and drank up the River <HI>Arath,</HI> that our Prophet might go over; by the Moon and thirteen Stars, which gave him light thro' the De&s;art of <HI>Lybia;</HI> by the Blood of ten thou&s;and <HI>Jews</HI> and Infidel Chri&s;tians, Sa|crificed at his Interment, and by the Tomb of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and all the <HI>Emirs</HI> and Pilgrims there attending with ince&s;&s;ant Devotion, that thou forget not thy bani&s;hed <HI>Mahmut,</HI> grown old in the Service of the Illu&s;trious King of Emperors, and Lord of Nations, and wearing pa&s;t the capacity of performing the Offices requir'd of me; forget me not, I &s;ay, righteous <HI>Mu&s;a,</HI> but procure my Relea&s;e, that
<PB N="3" REF="23">
I may not die among Dogs, and be blended in Earth with Infidels, and Enemies of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>It is time, &s;age Coun&s;ellor of the Wi&s;e, it is time, and ju&s;tice requires that a faithful Ser|vant, continued 48 Years in the Exile of a Se|cret Employ, and having with the utmo&s;t fi|delity di&s;charg'd my &s;elf, even to the &s;atisfa|ction or confu&s;ion of tho&s;e who envied me this Tru&s;t, &s;hould at la&s;t have liberty to come home and die in the Arms of my Friends, and be depo&s;ited in the Du&s;t with the Faithful.</P>
<P>The Troubles of Life can have no greate Reward, than to end in peace; it is the great Victory over the vici&s;&s;itudes of this World, the great Triumph that Wi&s;e and Good Men hope for, to lie down in the Grave, and be gather'd to the invi &s;ible Man&s;ions, in a State of Tran|quillity, and at the Door of the ble&s;&s;ed. Where|fore do millions travel in Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> and de&s;ire to have the Felicity to die there, but becau&s;e they believe they &s;hall from thence be immediately tran&s;ported into Paradi&s;e, in the view of our great and &s;ublime <HI>Mahomet?</HI> And what need have I of that difficulty, who am a Native of <HI>Arabia,</HI> ju&s;tly &s;tyl'd the happy; doubly &s;o, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by the Clime, and by the &s;acred Trea&s;ure repo&s;ed there: I &s;ay, who am a Na|tive of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and who, in returning to my own Country, &s;hall be happily &s;cituated even in &s;ight of the miraculous Monument of our Prophet, where I de&s;ire to end my Days in a manner &s;uitable to one, who&s;e Life has been devoted to the Intere&s;t and Honour of my Country.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="24">
Take it then into thy Power, exalted <HI>Mu&s;a,</HI> and think thy &s;elf fortunate, that thou art able to make one Happy Man, and to have one ancient Friend always ble&s;&s;ing thy Cha|rity, and &s;ending up ince&s;&s;ant Prayers for thy Health, and be not doubtful of finding a Suc|ce&s;&s;or equally quallified for this Employment, however nice; and if thou wilt have the Goodne&s;s to &s;end the Per&s;on hither to me, I will continue with him till I have &s;hewn him the way of Conver&s;ing with Mankind in this Place; &s;o as to make this Jealous Na|tion ea&s;ie in his Society, open to his Enqui|ries, and not &s;u&s;picious of his Employment.</P>
<P>Do this, Generous <HI>Saban,</HI> with a Friend&s;hip &s;uitable to that thou beare&s;t for me in former Years, when thou and I were Equals and Cam|rades in the Oda's of the <HI>Tekeh</HI> at <HI>Trapezond;</HI> and let not Fate, which has exalted thee above thy Friend, cau&s;e thee to forget, that as thou art already full of Years, as I al&s;o am; &s;o it is not many Days but we &s;hall be levell'd in the Du&s;t, and be equal again, till we meet in the Garden, and rejoyce in the Royal Palace of <HI>Eden;</HI> where not the highe&s;t in Human Glory, but the mo&s;t perfect in Vertue, &s;hall be receiv'd with the greate&s;t Splendor into the Regions of Eternal Delight.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. To <HI>Ha&s;&s;an Ebio Mirza Zebir,</HI> Great Muffty, or High-Prie&s;t of <HI>Maho|met.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ILLUSTRIOUS, Reverend, Re&s;plen|dent Image of the ble&s;&s;ed Lawgiver; I ki&s;s the du&s;t of thy &s;acred Feet, in reverence of that pure and un&s;potted Holine&s;s that &s;hines in thy Per&s;on, and which is truly Hereditary to the Chair of thy Office. I cannot &s;it here &s;urrounded with the Pageantry of Devotion, and &s;ee the ridiculous <HI>mimicking</HI> of the&s;e Infi|dels, in what they call Religion, without &s;ome Heavenly Meditations, which I offer at thy Feet, in Honour of the more pure In&s;titutions of our Great Prophet.</P>
<P>The&s;e Chri&s;tians here, finding the har&s;h and uncouth Model of their Religion, con&s;i&s;t|ing much in Celibacies, re&s;traint of Liberty, Mona&s;tick Severities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they had drawn their People into the practice of, in&s;tead of Religion, would not go down with the People, or reli&s;h well with tho&s;e who they knew, even from the barrenne&s;s of the Prin|ciple they went upon, could have no true ta&s;t of it <HI>as Religious;</HI> I &s;ay, the&s;e Chri&s;tians, in order to make amends for their other Foppe|ries, are fain to bring as much Mirth as they can into their Wor&s;hip, that the common People may have &s;omething in Religion to tickle and plea&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="26">
them; that &s;o if they cannot hold them by the &s;ublime, they may by the &s;en&s;itive part of their Wor&s;hip, as the Enthu&s;ia&s;ms of certain Hereticks which I remember in <HI>Arabia,</HI> which were animated by Fumes, and &s;moak of Herbs of an intoxicating quality, u&s;ed on purpo&s;e by their Dervices, to keep up the delu&s;ions of their Principles.</P>
<P>There is no talking with the&s;e Men upon the&s;e Points; for &s;hould I but ask one of them to be ingenuous, and confe&s;s on what occa&s;ion they introduced &s;o many antick Ge|&s;tures, &s;uch variety of Pictures, &s;uch Adora|tions, and above all, &s;uch variety of Mu&s;ical In&s;truments into their Mo&s;ques or Churches; and ask, whether it was not by the mechani&s;m of tho&s;e <HI>addenda,</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds, and move the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of their Pro|&s;elytes; they would pre&s;ently &s;tart at me, and cry our, <HI>I was a Heretick,</HI> and if I liv'd in &s;ome other parts of the Country, I &s;hould be certain|ly &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition: <HI>This is a Devili&s;h Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tick Judicature,</HI> where they pa&s;s Sen|tence upon tho&s;e who they think are in the lea&s;t apt to prye too much into the &s;acred Im|po&s;tures of their Religion.</P>
<P>Certainly, venerable Patriarch of the pure and faithful <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmans,</HI> the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> are the mo&s;t dete&s;table of all pretenders to Religion in the World; for at the &s;ame time that they call them&s;elves the Di&s;ciples of their Prophet <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they have brought into their forms of Wor&s;hip, &s;o many Innovations, and Traditional Corrup|tions, which him&s;elf never directed, that their Religion has now very little of the fir&s;t In&s;ti|tution in it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="27">
It is without que&s;tion true, that this <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who they are denominated from, was a very Holy Per&s;on, indued with Heavenly Wi&s;dom; that he wrought innumerable Miracles, and left them pure Doctrines in Writings taken from his Mouth, and dictated to his Fol|lowers; and tho' we do not allow him to be any ways like to our mo&s;t divine <HI>Mahomet;</HI> yet the Alchoran of this their Prophet <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> con|tains innumerable and excellent Precepts, which his Di&s;ciples for &s;ome Ages follow'd with great exactne&s;s, and &s;uffer'd inexpre&s;&s;ible Torments from the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors and Government, in the defence of. But their Succe&s;&s;ors degenera|ting from the purity and the rectitude of Prin|ciple, which their &s;aid Ance&s;tors retain'd, have corrupted their Religion to that degree, that it is now one of the greate&s;t pieces of confu&s;ion and Buffoonry on Earth.</P>
<P>It would have fill'd thee with Indignation, Venerable and Holy <HI>Mirza,</HI> had&s;t thou been here the other day, when the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> were paying their publick Thanks to their Prophet <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who thou knowe&s;t they pretend to &s;ay is even equal with God. I went once into one of their Idolatrous Temples, or Mo&s;ques, to &s;ee the Pageantry of their Wor&s;hip; which Curio&s;ity led me to ob&s;erve very particularly, becau&s;e it was upon an occa&s;ion of Rejoycing, or Thank&s;giving, as they call it, for taking of <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> a City of the Emperor on the <HI>Rhine;</HI> when I was not only a&s;toni&s;hed at the ridiculous folly of &s;uch a polite Nation as this is; but even provok'd with a holy rage, and I curs'd them by <HI>Mahomet</HI> three times, re|&s;erving
<PB N="8" REF="28">
&s;erving it farther to thee to confirm the <HI>Anathe|ma</HI>'s which they have rea&s;on to expect and fall under.</P>
<P>Verily it is &s;carce to be imagin'd how they can pretend, if they did believe the ineffable Glory of the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and that their Sacrifices were offered to him, that he would be Captivated by the noi&s;e of Fiddles and Bag-pipes, the &s;hooting of Great Ordnance, the beating of Kettle-Drums, and the Clamour of Trumpets. But thus it was, for their great Rhap&s;ody of Prai&s;e, which they call <HI>Te Deum,</HI> is thus managed. Behold ju&s;t before they began their Song in the Mo&s;que, 50 pieces of Canon were fir'd without, as if they intend|ed to awaken their Prophet with the noi&s;e. Im|mediately after this, and ju&s;t before the Door of the great Mo&s;que, I was &s;urpriz'd with the confu&s;ion of 12 Kettle-Drums, five &s;ets of Trumpets plac'd at proper Di&s;tances, and 30 Drummers of the King's Guards of Foot, which for a quarter of an hour complimented their God with Tabor and Pipe.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was over, an Anthem, &s;o they call their Idolatrous Song which they Sing on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, began within the Mo&s;que, &s;ung by the Voices of Eunuchs, Boys, and Wo|men, taught for tho&s;e wicked Purpo&s;es. Their Voices were indeed excellent, and had they been employ'd on Occa&s;ions of Mirth and Delight, not for the debauching the Mind with corrupt Ideas in Religion, the Harmony of them was admirably fine&punc; The&s;e Singers are placed in Stalls for that purpo&s;e, in &s;everal gra|dations, as their Voices ri&s;e; then followed
<PB N="9" REF="29">
the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> which was &s;ung with the like Voices, but mixt with innumerable &s;orts of In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, &s;uch as Fiddles, Ba&s;e-Viols, Hautboys, Fifes, Cymballs, Timbrels, Harps, Organs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and continu'd about half an hour, and then went off (as it all begun) with Drums, Trumpets, Kettle-Drums, and 50 pieces of Canon from without.</P>
<P>Tell me, &s;age Prophet, who guides the Con|&s;ciences of the faithful in paying their pure and unmix'd Devotions to one undivided Eter|nal Being, the Great <HI>ALLA,</HI> and directs them with &s;imple and humble Devotion, to &s;end up Prayers five times a Day to his ineffable Throne. Tell me what coherence can this have with the &s;acred thing called Religion, or with the nature of Adoration, and giving prai&s;e? which ought to be perform'd by humble Crea|tures, to the Creator of Heaven and Earth, to whom they &s;hould rather appear as Penitent Offenders, with Mortifications and Sacrifices of &s;orrowful Hearts, trembling even in their Thank&s;giving, than with a noi&s;e of Mu&s;ick, and Voices of Triumph, as if they were In|viting their great Prophet to a Fe&s;tival, or Ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>I think often, when I reflect on the&s;e Infi|dels, that they mu&s;t certainly have very gro&s;s Conceptions of God, and may well be &s;aid to think of him after the manner of Men; that is, that he acts after the manner of Men; it is not po&s;&s;ible that they can reverence his Di|vine Being in that awful and humble manner as the true Believers, who wa&s;hing their Bo|dies from outward defilement, conceive of God
<PB N="10" REF="30">
with perfect Ideas, covering their Eyes, and retreating with Heavenly Solitude into the inmo&s;t Soul, to contemplate the Being, who is the Sum and Sub&s;tance of inconceivable Glory.</P>

<P>As thou art by thy Title, Lord of Lords; and by thy Office, the fir&s;t and greate&s;t <HI>Beg|lerbeg</HI> of the whole Mu&s;&s;ulman Empire, the Right Hand of the Invincible <HI>Achmet,</HI> our mighty Emperor, and art entru&s;ted by his Command, with the mo&s;t eminent Affairs of his Government, during the ab&s;ence of the Vizier <HI>Azem,</HI> now on his pro&s;perous Expedition to the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>I know that thy Martial Genius, as well as thy great Office, pre&s;iding over all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Dominions in <HI>Europe,</HI> enclines thee to receive willingly an Account of the great Tran&s;acti|ons in the <HI>Nazareen</HI> World; &s;o I may call this Part wherein I Sojourn, for the good of thy great Ma&s;ter, and the Service of the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power.</P>
<P>Thou art not ignorant, Wi&s;e and Valiant <HI>Cicala,</HI> of the great Overthrow of the mighty Emperor of the I&s;lands, call'd here &s;lightly the King of <HI>England;</HI> for know, this haughty Court gives &s;light and mean Titles to all their Neigh|bouring Princes; for this King of <HI>England</HI> is indeed a mo&s;t powerful Prince, and his Empire, tho' not large in extent, yet in Power and Strength is exceeding great; principally found|ed

in the prodigious Wealth, and the immen&s;e Riches of his Country, and People. He al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es be&s;ides the great I&s;lands of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> I &s;ay he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es infinite Tracts of Land, I&s;lands and Colonies, in the remote&s;t parts of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Hali Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> the late happy <HI>Chaimacam</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> thy Friend and mine, Com|manded me to write to him the Hi&s;tory of the Fall of the King of that Country, call'd <HI>Eng|land;</HI> which I did at large, with the Cha|racter of his Per&s;on; for we now &s;ee him here taking Sanctuary in the Court of the King of <HI>France,</HI> who is his great Friend and Pro|tector.

<P><PB N="14" REF="34">
Know then, Illu&s;trious and Valiant Leader of the faithful Ho&s;t, that true it is that the pre|&s;ent King of <HI>France,</HI> is the greate&s;t of all the Kings of the Chri&s;tian Nations, abounding in Wealth, and immen&s;e Trea&s;ures, &s;urrounded with Numerous and Victorious Armies; and it is no more to be que&s;tioned but that he is, and al&s;o then was, a &s;incere Friend to the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> King, and would very willingly have prevented the Mi&s;chief which has &s;ince befallen him; nay, had he not been his Friend, yet Prudence, and Policy of State required that he would by no means have &s;uffer'd the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King to have been &s;o Invaded; &s;eeing he knew perfectly well that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was not only a Warlike Prince in him|&s;elf, but was al&s;o a profe&s;s'd Enemy to the Greatne&s;s and Ambition of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o true, that this King of <HI>France</HI> is now, and was at that time, in the very Me|ridian of his Glory, cloath'd with innumerable Triumphs and Trophies of Victory, which are the Envy and Grief of all the Nations about him; and that all tho&s;e Nations would rejoyce to &s;ee the &s;aid <HI>Prince of Orange</HI> &s;trengthned by the addition of the Engli&s;h Power, that they might joyn in Confederacy with him, to Bri|dle the the Exorbitance of the <HI>French</HI> Great|ne&s;s, which begins to be terrible to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Yet mo&s;t true it is, that nothing but the in|fatuation and unaccountable indolence of this great Monarch has, next to the irre&s;i&s;table De|crees of Heaven, brought this great Affair to pa&s;s; and this doubtle&s;s was the Rea&s;on why the illu&s;trious <HI>Chaimacam</HI> enjoyn'd me with
<PB N="15" REF="35">
&s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s to acquaint him with the&s;e things; &s;ince to him, as I doubt not it will to thee, <HI>who art as he was, well acquainted with the &s;tate of things in the&s;e parts of the World:</HI> It &s;eem'd very &s;trange, that the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould &s;tand &s;till and look on, in a matter which &s;o nearly concern'd his Friend and Allie, and in ef|fect him&s;elf, and not prevent a mi&s;chief big with &s;uch dangerous Events.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t then acquaint thee, that one fal&s;e &s;tep in the King of <HI>France,</HI> has been the Oc|ca&s;ion of all this Di&s;a&s;ter to his Friend the King of <HI>England,</HI> and without which it had been impo&s;&s;ible for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to have brought any of his De&s;igns to pa&s;s, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>At the very juncture of the Preparations of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King, as if he was Con|federate with them, re&s;olving to pu&s;h at the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;ends the Dauphine with a <HI>French</HI> Army of 60000 Men, quite out of the way to the upper <HI>Rhine,</HI> and cau&s;es him to &s;it down before <HI>Phillipsburg;</HI> whereas had he cau&s;ed 50000 Men to have advanc'd to the <HI>Maes,</HI> and but hover'd over the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fron|tiers, tho' without any attempt, the <HI>Dutch</HI> could never have parted with their Troops to make the attempt in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Mea&s;ures they are now &s;atisfied here were wrong, and the mo&s;t formidable Enemy they have, is by this very &s;tep &s;trengthned with the addition of tho&s;e Kingdoms, which alone are a|ble to look the <HI>French</HI> Armies in the Face. But the Opinion tho&s;e People have of the invincible Power of their King is &s;uch, that they value not the whole World; which Confidence may
<PB N="16" REF="36">
however be Fatal to them in the End. Indeed his Armies are compos'd of excellent Troops, but then it is to be con&s;ider'd, that they are not all compo&s;ed of his own Subjects; nay, tho&s;e which are of his own Subjects are not e&s;teem'd his be&s;t Troops; but his Armies are compo&s;ed of <HI>Germans, Swi&s;s, Iri&s;h, Scots,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and whenever a &s;trong Confede|racy &s;hall &s;o attack him, as that he &s;hall not be able to make up the Lo&s;s of the&s;e, with Men of the &s;ame Nations, they will find the <HI>French</HI> In|fantry inferior to any of the Neighbouring Na|tions.</P>
<P>But this mu&s;t be granted, that the Officers of the <HI>French</HI> Troops are good; and it is to their Conduct, that the Glory of their Mo|narch is owing. There is a Saying which is made u&s;e of, when they talk of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nations by way of compari&s;on, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that of the <HI>French; If the Soldiers will but follow, the Officers will always lead;</HI> andthat of the <HI>Engli&s;h, If the Officers will but lead, the Soldiers will always follow;</HI> &s;o that by the way, an Army of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers, led by <HI>French</HI> Officers, would be invin|cible.</P>
<P>How glorious are the Troops of thy Illu&s;tri|ous Emperor, in who&s;e Cau&s;e both Soldiers and Officers, equally emulous of Glory, and of &s;erving well the mo&s;t invincible Monarch of the Univer&s;e, are equally ready both to lead, and to follow, and to fix the glorious Cre&s;cent, the En&s;igns of our Great <HI>Mahomet,</HI> upon the vanqui&s;h'd Frontiers of the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Enemies; may thy ways be pro&s;perous, and thy Arms

<HEAD>LETTER IV. To the mo&s;t Heavenly Pattern of Wi&s;dom and Purity, <HI>Ha&s;&s;an Mirza Zebir,</HI> Prince of the Muftys.</HEAD>
<P>IF I were to &s;alute thee, Venerable Maje&s;tick Guide of Truth, and Lover of the Faithful, in the Language of the&s;e <HI>Nazareens,</HI> when they addre&s;s them&s;elves to the great <HI>Mufti</HI> of their Religion; I &s;hould give thee, and more ju&s;tly by far, the Title of <HI>Soveraign Pontiff,</HI> with the Addition of <HI>your Holine&s;s;</HI> and acknowledge an infallibillty in judging and determining all religious Controver&s;ies, to be inherent to thy Office.</P>
<P>How effectually do all the&s;e Particulars &s;hine in thy Per&s;on and Character, who art really holy, and &s;ublimely wi&s;e, Titles which they pre&s;um|ptuou&s;ly a&s;cribe oftentimes to the Wickede&s;t of Men; for thou may&s;t know, immortal <HI>Zebir,</HI> that the&s;e <HI>Soveraign Pontiff</HI>'s or <HI>Mufty</HI>'s here, who they addre&s;s by the Stile of <HI>his Holine&s;s,</HI> as above, are &s;ometimes <HI>the vile&s;t Creatures in the Univer&s;e;</HI> nay, they often are mo&s;t wretch|edly &s;candalous, drunken, perjur'd, lewd, and;
<PB N="18" REF="38">
in a Word, turbulent, bloody, and &s;uperlative|ly wicked: till the People them&s;elves are a|&s;hamed of them, and have been oblig'd to de|po&s;e them, either by the Help of the <HI>German</HI> Emperor, or the <HI>French;</HI> it would be too long to enter into the Hi&s;tory of them.</P>
<P>This &s;hall be the Glory of our holy Prophet, and &s;hall eternize his Name, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the great Prince of the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is a Pattern of ju&s;t Men; inimitable for all the Endowments of the Mind; has a Soul equal to the highe&s;t Function upon Earth, I mean, the Heavenly Office of expounding infallibly the &s;ublime Truths of our holy Alcoran; and interpreting, without Appeal, all the Doctrines of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>But to give thee a true Idea of the pretended infallible Guide of the&s;e deluded <HI>Nazareens,</HI> the Story I am going to tell thee is recorded here even by them&s;elves, of one of their Popes; being the &s;ame who&s;e &s;candalous Conduct, in the Sale of his imaginary forg'd Pardons and Benedicti|ons to the People, was the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion of the Defection which <HI>Luther</HI> made among them; that famous Dervice, who, as I formerly wrote thee, was the Father of the Separation or Facti|on among the <HI>Nazareens:</HI> This Pope, or great Mufty, gave a living Te&s;timony to what we, the true Believers, hold concerning the whole Sy&s;tem of their Religion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that it is a Fiction of the Dervices, contriv'd to delude the People; and this horrid Creature was, it &s;eems, not able to contain the Truth, tho' it was &s;o needful on his Side to be concealed; the Occa&s;ion, it &s;eems, was, that &s;eeing an immen&s;e and unexpected Sum of Money returned into his Trea&s;ury at
<PB N="19" REF="39">
<HI>Rome,</HI> from his Mi&s;&s;ionary Dervices, who he had &s;ent Abroad to make Sale of Indulgences, Relicks, and other Frippery of the <HI>Vatican;</HI> He was &s;o &s;urprized with the unlook'd for Heap of Gold, that he cries out as in a Rapture,</P>
<P><HI>Heu! quantum profuit hac fabula Chri&s;ti.</HI> What prodigious Gain, &s;ays he, do we make of this Fable of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Immortal <HI>Mirza,</HI> if the Soveraign Pontiff, the &s;upreme Mufty of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> has declar'd the whole Sy&s;tem of the Religion of their great Prophet, to be but a religious Cheat, a holy Fable; what need we any further Te&s;timony? What greater Witne&s;s can the true Believers de&s;ire, to confirm them in the Heavenly Way, than the open Confe&s;&s;ion of the great <HI>Papa,</HI> or Father of the Chri&s;tians, who has acknow|ledg'd that they are all Deceivers, and that the Story of their great Prophet <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is but a Fable?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, do they not own that this their great High Prie&s;t is infallible in all he &s;ays or does? It is not many Moons ago, &s;ince at their Annual Tribunal of the holy Inqui&s;ition, &s;o they call the mo&s;t Helli&s;h Con&s;titution on Earth, where they held what they call an <HI>auto de fe,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a general <HI>Audit of the Faith,</HI> to give Judgment on tho&s;e they call Hereticks; they burnt alive without Mercy, two Men, for &s;aying their great Mufty was not infallible.</P>
<P>This we ju&s;tly take hold of again&s;t them, and prove then, from the Mouth of their infallible Oracle, that all the Scheme of their Religion is but a Fable, a Cheat, a Piece of Dervice Craft to get Money; and, in a Word, illu&s;trious <HI>Mirza,</HI> that their &s;upreme Mufty or high Prie&s;t, is but a religious <HI>Zavin,</HI> or <HI>Pick-Pocket.</HI></P>

Heaven doubtle&s;s has infatuated the&s;e Infi|dels, and given them up to dote on the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdities; other wi&s;e they could never &s;wal|low &s;uch open and notorious Impo&s;itions: Con|ver&s;ing once with a Sect of the <HI>Nazarenes</HI> here, whom they call <HI>Hugonots,</HI> one of them 'told me, their great Prophet <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did foretel, that in the la&s;t Days of the World his Di&s;ciples &s;hould do thus, <HI>(viz.)

<P>The&s;e <HI>Hugonots</HI> are by far an hone&s;ter and wi&s;er Sect of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> than tho&s;e who are called <HI>Catholicks,</HI> and therefore have been per&s;ecuted, and even extirpated out of the King|dom of <HI>France;</HI> and they do not fail to expo&s;e daily, when they are in Companies and Soci|eties where they can do it freely, the Cheats the Impo&s;itions, and the Ab&s;urdities of the <HI>Ca|tholicks:</HI> There are divers Sects of the&s;e Peo|ple, who have broken off from the great Mufty, and they are denominated either from the Countries where they live, or the Patrons from whom they derive their Opinions; as <HI>Lutherans</HI> from <HI>Luther, Calvini&s;ts</HI> from <HI>Calvin,</HI> and the like; and though I look upon the&s;e to be, as above, the better Sort by far, as to their Mora|lity, and as to their Principles; yet they differ again one from another, and &s;eparate even in

Charity and Affection, as much as the <HI>Ottomans</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> do, about the Succe&s;&s;ors to our Great Prophet <HI>Mahomet;</HI> Nay, they have like|wi&s;e proceeded to Per&s;ecution, and even to Blood.</P>
<P>If Love and Unity be the Band of Religion, and the Pledge of a Title to Paradi&s;e; que&s;tion|le&s;s the Mu&s;&s;ulmen enjoy the be&s;t Tokens of the Felicity which we look for in the Garden of God; for no &s;uch Divi&s;ions are &s;een among them as reign in the&s;e Parts of the World, where every Man &s;ets up a Religion of his own, and walks in the light of his own Vi&s;ion; thinking it his Duty to damn all the re&s;t of Mankind to the Infernal Pit, who are not of his Opinion; and, if I am not wrong, there is a Man among the&s;e Chri&s;tians, who has given a Scheme or Plan, which he calls <HI>Here&s;yography,</HI> in which he gives an Account of the Di&s;&s;entions of the &s;eve|ral Sorts of Chri&s;tians; and, I think, he reck|ons up about three&s;core and fourteen Sects, who all call them&s;elves the Followers of their great Prophet. So uncertain is the Light by which the&s;e Men are directed, &s;o imperfect the Rules and Doctrines which their great Prophet left them, as the fundamental Law of their Obedience; or rather, &s;o ill do they ob&s;erve his Rules, and obey his Dictates; for we know that their Me&s;&s;iah left them excellent Rules, as the Principles of Life to guide to the Cele&s;tial Paradi&s;e; but &s;o degenerated are the&s;e his Followers, that albeit they are called by his Name, yet very little of his fir&s;t In&s;titutes are found in the model of their Religion.

<P>The Truth is, the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> make no Scruple to je&s;t with the mo&s;t &s;acred Things in their pretended Wor&s;hip, and banter one another about it; which is to me a certain Sign, that whatever &s;eeming Formalities they may have in their Religion, they believe little of the Thing them&s;elves; but rather, have the &s;ame Opinion of it that we have, <HI>(viz)</HI> that it is all a holy Cheat, contrived to &s;upport the Prie&s;ts who at fir&s;t invented it, and made U&s;e of only to get Money.</P>

<P>I Cannot refrain laying at thy &s;acred Feet, ble&s;&s;ed Image of the Soveraign Law-Giver, what I meet with in this Part of the World, &s;uited to thy &s;ublime Station; and in particu|lar
<PB N="28" REF="48">
to that exalted Temper of thy Soul, by which thou frame&s;t In&s;truction out of the evil Actions of wicked Men, to the Advantage of the Ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Thou art to know then, that the <HI>French</HI> Na|tion, where I live, have, under the Conduct of a mo&s;t furious and victorious Prince, made War for two Years upon the Emperor of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> and that with great Succe&s;s: That in the Pro&s;ecution of this War, and in Order, as they &s;ay here, to intimidate and terrify the <HI>Germans,</HI> he has cau&s;ed his Troops to make the mo&s;t dreadful Ravages upon the Frontiers, that can be imagin'd: They &s;et Fire to the Villages in a mo&s;t fruitful and plea&s;ant Country, call'd the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> in five Places at once, <HI>(viz)</HI> on each Border of that Country, and at one Place in the middle; and &s;uffered them to burn every Way, till they all joined in one Flame: It is not po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe to thee the De&s;olation made, the Ruin of innumerable Families, the De&s;truction of flouri&s;hing Cities, fine Palaces, the Murthers of Men, ravi&s;hing of Women, and all Manner of De&s;olations.</P>
<P>But the Rea&s;on for which I give thee an Account of this Affair in particular, is for what follows; that the King of <HI>France,</HI> after all the&s;e Cruelties and Inhumanities committed by his Command, or at lea&s;t by his Allowance, has ordered a Day to be &s;et apart for a <HI>Biram,</HI> or Fea&s;t of Thank&s;giving, and to give Thanks to God in all the Frontier Towns on that Side of his Conque&s;ts, for <HI>compleating &s;o glorious an Expedition;</HI> the&s;e are the very Words of his Orders: The true Sen&s;e &s;hould have been, for compleating the Ruin of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Country in that Part of the World, and &s;cat|tering
<PB N="29" REF="49">
an hundred thou&s;and Families of mi&s;era|ble Inhabitants to &s;eek their Bread; be&s;ides the Murther, Ravi&s;hments, and inimitable Cruelties practi&s;ed by the Soldiers in the Action.</P>
<P>Surely the&s;e Infidels ought to be e&s;teemed truly dete&s;table, for their Notions of the great ONE GOD, who has created the World, that they can think it acceptable to his divine Puri|ty, and to the Perfection of his Being, to de&s;troy his Creatures, and depopulate his Creation; or that he can accept Thanks offered up to him for Actions, which, it is mo&s;t certain, his Nature abhors. I remember to have &s;een &s;ome Lines publi&s;hed in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, which, it is &s;aid, were thrown into a Mo&s;que, in the Ca|pital City of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, when they were giving Thanks to their <HI>Nazareen</HI> Prophet, for the Di&s;covery of a Plot, for which &s;ome who had been found guilty of it were executed. The Lines, it was apparent, were made by &s;ome who were of the other Side, as follows.<Q><L>Ye Hypocrites, leave off your Pranks,</L>
<L>To murther Men, and give God Thanks:</L>
<L>Forbear, for Shame, proceed no further;</L>
<L>For God accepts no Thanks for Murther.</L></Q></P>
<P>They mu&s;t have very gro&s;s Conceptions of God, I &s;ay, who can pre&s;ume to give him Thanks for the Deva&s;tation and Ruin of their Fellow Creatures, and for the Rapine and De|&s;truction which Men, given up to the Fury of their Lu&s;t and Rage, &s;hall execute in the World; if the righteous Power of Heaven concerns it &s;elf with any of the Actions of the&s;e Enemies of his Glory, and has not re&s;olv'd to give them entirely up to the Puni&s;hments of Hell, he will certainly te&s;tify his Re&s;entment, not only for
<PB N="30" REF="50">
the Crime of Blood and De&s;truction, in the Fact it &s;elf, but for that horrid Mockery of his Ju&s;tice, in entitling him by their prai&s;es to the Rapin which is in their Hands; as if they were doing him an acceptable Service, in &s;ending thou|&s;ands of Souls into the Regions of Darkne&s;s, for the Caprice and Ambition of one Man.</P>
<P>But that which is &s;till more particular in this religious Mockery is, that the <HI>French</HI> have ob|liged the very People of the Country it &s;elf to joyn in this Ceremony; and have even pre&s;crib'd to them a Text to preach upon, being &s;ome Ver&s;e out of their ancient Writings thus, <HI>Come, let us root them out, that they be no more a Nation.</HI> This is the mo&s;t horrible Impo&s;ition that ever I have met with of its kind; and is indeed ac|knowledged by many to be very barbarous, &s;eeing the&s;e Men are all of one Religion, pro|fe&s;&s;ing to be all Followers of the Prophet <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the <HI>Nazareen,</HI> their Me&s;&s;iah, and Teacher.</P>
<P>Sage Oracle of Heavenly Knowledge, thou wilt read this Hi&s;tory of <HI>Nazareen</HI> Hypocri&s;y with a ju&s;t Dete&s;tation of Soul; <HI>Mahomet</HI> has told us, that God, who is but one God, will puni&s;h tho&s;e with Fire who mock his Power, and make a Je&s;t of his righteous Government; teaching Cruelty and Inju&s;tice for Truth, and entituling God, <HI>who is gracious and merciful,</HI> to Robbery and Ravi&s;hment, Injury and Blood.</P>

<P>The&s;e are worn about the Necks of Kings, Queens, Princes, Ladies with Child, Virgins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pre&s;erve them from the Devil, from frightful Dreams, from Trea&s;on, to keep the Women with Child from Mi&s;carriage, and the young Women from Fits, Frenzies of the Matrix, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and (which indeed is the Intent and Meaning of all the holy Fraud;) they are &s;old for the&s;e Purpo&s;es by the Prie&s;ts, at an ine&s;timable Price, and the Juggle &s;ometimes comes to Light.</P>
<P>A Merchant of <HI>Rochel</HI> lately put an excel|lent Cheat upon the Dervices of a Convent or Cell of Religious, near that City; it &s;eems the Merchant was in bad Circum&s;tances as to his E&s;tate, and upon the Point of turning Bankrupt, when a Ship coming into Port <HI>Louis</HI> from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> he forms a Letter as written from <HI>Goa</HI> by his Brother; wherein he tells him of a mo&s;t miraculous Relick of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> being a Piece of the Scull of that ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle of their Religion, which had done the mo&s;t won|derful Cures in the mo&s;t violent Di&s;tempers of the Head and Brain; that it cured all manner of Lunacy and Di&s;traction, adding, that he had Te&s;timonials of the &s;ame from the Convent of Fryers, of tho&s;e they call <HI>Jacobins,</HI> at <HI>Goa,</HI> where his Brother had been, and where all the&s;e miraculous Things were wrought; and that in particular it re&s;tored the Memory in one who had quite lo&s;t all Sen&s;e of Things pa&s;t for &s;ome Years, by being put about the Neck (the Jewel hanging behind in the Poll) by the Hands of a Fryer of that Order, and the like: Having got|ten

this Story put into Form, and finding the Fathers very earne&s;t to obtain this Jewel, and willing to give a very great Price for it, he accordingly obliges him&s;elf to write to his Brother, to &s;end it over by the next Ship; taking a Contract from the Fathers for 6000 Crowns to be paid upon Delivery.</P>
<P>Having obtained this Contract he goes to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> with it, where telling the Story as in Confidence to a Per&s;on there, he acquaints the Bi&s;hop of that Place; who being de&s;irous to obtain &s;o rich a Prize, and viewing the authen|tick Contract of the Fryers of <HI>Rochel,</HI> offers the Merchant 20000 Crowns for the holy Relick, if he will bring it immediately to him: The Merchant accordingly having all his Affairs ready, and having a Piece of an old Scull made up in an Encha&s;ement of Gold, with the Date of the Year back about 230 Years before the Time, and the Names of two religious Men of <HI>Goa</HI> of the fir&s;t planting that Colony; who&s;e Names he had learnt, and the Work made &s;o art|fully, as to appear very ancient: I &s;ay, Having all the&s;e Things ready, he waits till an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ship arriv'd at <HI>Lisbon</HI> from <HI>Goa,</HI> which is a Co|lony of the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> and then pretending to have received the Jewel, writes to the Bi&s;hop, who with great Solemnity received it, and paid him his Money.</P>
<P>This Story I do not avouch to thee of my own Knowledge, the Fact, if it were true, having been done &s;ome Years before my Coming hither; but many Cheats like this having been daily di&s;cover'd among them, this is worth Credit: Nothing is more &s;trange to me, than that a Nation &s;o intelligent as this is, &s;hould not long ago have been &s;urfeit|ed with the&s;e miraculous Fripperies; and yet &s;o

<P>Be&s;ides all this, we have Rea&s;on to know that the whole Cro&s;s on which he was &s;aid to be crucified, is miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved in a Vault arched over with Gold, an hundred Eathom within the Earth, under the Foundation of the great Mo&s;que, at the &s;ublime Port, which was formerly a Temple of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> dedicated, as they call it, to Saint <HI>Sophia;</HI> &s;o that all this Story of Relicks is no more than a Legend of Forgeries and Fables.</P>
<P>And yet the great King of <HI>France,</HI> who, it mu&s;t be own'd, is a wi&s;e, a &s;agacious, a pene|trating Man, as well as a great King, never lies down in his Bed without innumerable Relicks of Saints, as they call them, hanging about his Neck, on the Curtains of his Bed, and on the Locks of his Chamber Doors, as Guardians and Pre&s;ervatives to keep him from the Power of evil Spirits.

<P>IN all the World there is not a greater Im|po&s;tor than this great Mufty or Soveraign Pontiff of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> whom they call the Pope; the Chair they &s;it in, and from whence they derive their pretended Infallibility, has been defiled with more Mon&s;ters than the Idol of <HI>Ba&s;&s;amene</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> or the pretended Oracle of <HI>Ar&s;aballa</HI> in the De&s;ert of <HI>Chu&s;argha;</HI> &s;ome|times indeed they obtain a Per&s;on of &s;ome Mo|rals to fill that my&s;terious Seat of Wickedne&s;s, <HI>&s;uch was the late</HI> Innocent XI. This, for ought I know, may be permitted, by the Subtilty of the Devil, to keep up the Delu&s;ion, that the People &s;hould not be &s;o &s;urfeited with the con|tinual Crimes of the Pontiff, as to abhor the Pontificate it &s;elf. But even the&s;e Men of Mo|rals have &s;o much canting hypocritical Stuff mingled with their other Conduct; and permit &s;uch Frauds, &s;uch open Crimes, among their Sub-mufty's, &s;uch as their Cardinals, Bi&s;hops,
<PB N="38" REF="58">
Abbots, and the various Orders of their <HI>Dervices</HI> or Clergy, that certain it is, and nothing more vi&s;ible, than that the whole Con&s;titution is a &s;tated univer&s;al Cheat.</P>
<P>I have been curious to &s;earch into the&s;e Frauds, for the Confirmation of the true Believers; not but that we, the true Mu&s;&s;ulmen and Believers of the Verity, know with a Certainty that permits us not to doubt that their whole Sy&s;tem of this part of the Doctrine of the <HI>Naza|reens,</HI> is a Delu&s;ion, and a meer Invention of their Dervices, to e&s;tabli&s;h an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Ty|ranny in the World: But it mu&s;t needs confirm us all the more, and add infinite Satisfaction to us, to have this confe&s;&s;ed and te&s;tified out of the Mouths of the&s;e Infidels them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I lately read &s;ome Tracts written by &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned of this Nation of the <HI>Franks,</HI> among whom I dwell, wherein they &s;peak with the utmo&s;t Dete&s;tation of this great Mufty, called <HI>Pope;</HI> and not &s;o much concerning the Character or Morals of the Per&s;on, tho' he who they have now elevated is but a very indifferent Per&s;on that Way, but even of the Pontificate it &s;elf; I mean, the Authority exerci&s;ed, and the Principles profe&s;&s;ed by the See of <HI>Rome</HI> in gene|ral; that is, by the Pope, Cardinals, Bi&s;hops, and all the cloi&s;tered Crew, called the <HI>Roman</HI> Clergy.</P>
<P>This Author, whom they call Mon&s;ieur <HI>Jeurieu,</HI> is one of tho&s;e who are here call'd <HI>Hugonots,</HI> of whom I have formerly written thee a large Account; who have long &s;ince di&s;own'd the&s;e People I &s;peak of. He is one of the mo&s;t learn|ed of the&s;e <HI>Hugonots,</HI> and is now bani&s;hed this Kingdom for his refu&s;ing to acknowledge the Pope; but he is &s;o far from complying, that in
<PB N="39" REF="59">
his Writings he offers to prove this Soveraign Pontiff, not only not to be the true Follower of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> their crucified Pro|phet and Me&s;&s;iah, but an Apo&s;tate; and that his Chair is the Seat of the Bea&s;t; that his Power is not only not Chri&s;tian, but <HI>Antichri|&s;tian;</HI> that he is the great <HI>FALSE PROPHET</HI> &s;poken of in the Writings of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Talmud,</HI> and in the Regi&s;ters of their <HI>Rabbies,</HI> which they call by the Name of Revelation. Nay, in one of his Books, he calls the <HI>Roman</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment, which they call the Church, the great <HI>Scarlet Whore;</HI> producing &s;undry Predictions among the Writings of the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> which give a very expre&s;s and particular Character of the <HI>Papal</HI> Tyranny, under &s;uch Denominations, prophecying her Downfal at la&s;t under the Allu&s;ion of the Fall of the City of <HI>Babylon;</HI> and that the Kings of the Earth &s;hall hate her; (the Whore) that is, the <HI>Papal Hierarchy,</HI> and &s;hall burn her Fle&s;h with Fire.</P>
<P>Verily, Great Apo&s;tle of the true Believers, it &s;eems to me that the&s;e Men, whom they call <HI>Hugonots,</HI> and who are the Followers of one <HI>Calvin,</HI> who &s;ucceeded <HI>Luther</HI> in the fir&s;t great De|fection from the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctrines of Religion; I &s;ay, the&s;e <HI>Hugonots</HI> are a &s;ober, zealous People; much more upright and devout than the Fol|lowers of the Pope, and &s;eem to me to have much the better of the Argument again&s;t them; for albeit they acknowledge that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was originally the Church planted by the Followers of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and continued faithful to the In&s;titutions of the &s;aid <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as dictated to them by his &s;aid Followers; yet they &s;ugge&s;t, that by the Corruption of many Ages, and the a&s;&s;uming Di&s;po&s;ition of the Popes, and their Dervices or Clergy, they have intro|duced
<PB N="40" REF="60">
&s;o many Innovations, &s;uch Idolatrous Practices, and &s;o many dete&s;table Additions, to the fir&s;t Doctrines left them by the Me&s;&s;iah, that there remains nothing with them of the fir&s;t In&s;titution.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> laid down to his Followers and Di&s;ciples mo&s;t pure and holy Rules, both of Religion and of moral Vertue: But it is true al&s;o that the&s;e Pontiffs, and their Followers, have filled them with &s;o many horrible Impo&s;itions, that the Originals are not now to be known; e&s;pecially that of their wor&s;hipping a Piece of Bread as a God, &s;ugge&s;ting that a few Words of a common Der|vice can effectually tran&s;mutate the Species of Bread into the Sub&s;tance of their crucified Me&s;&s;iah; an Idolatry horrible and dete&s;table!</P>
<P>But I return to the Per&s;ons of their Popes, to who&s;e Crimes indeed all the&s;e Innovations in the Religion of the Me&s;&s;iah are owing; I have formerly mentioned to thee, and to thy happy Predece&s;&s;or, now rejoycing in the Garden of Plea&s;ure, the Story of a Woman counterfeit, who was made a Pope, but by being gotten with Child by one of her own Servants, and deliver'd in the open Street in <HI>Rome,</HI> expo&s;ed that Cheat to the World. The <HI>Nazareens</HI> &s;trive to reject it as a Fal&s;hood, and charge it as an Invention of the <HI>Hugonots;</HI> but be&s;ides that the Story is recorded long before <HI>Luther,</HI> or any of tho&s;e they call Reformers, were heard of; and is confe&s;&s;ed by &s;o many of their own Writers, there is no Room to doubt of the Truth; parti|cularly one <HI>Bapti&s;ta Mantuanus,</HI> a famous Poet among them, writing &s;atyrically of Hell, as if he was &s;hewing a Stranger the Place, and telling him where every great Per&s;on was to be found, has it thus;<Q><PB N="41" REF="61">

<HEAD>LETTER X. To the venerable &s;age Guide of Wi&s;|dom, Prince of the Law of <HI>Maho|met,</HI> Great <HI>Muffti,</HI> and High-Prie&s;t of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmans.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SEND thee, bright Oracle of Truth and Virtue, a piece of News confirm'd from all parts of the <HI>Nazareen</HI> Dominion, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> that the Great <HI>Caliph</HI> of the Chri&s;tians, Prince of the Dervices of the <HI>Nazareen</HI> Faith, is Dead; the Infallible Guide, as they call him here, the Mirror of Holine&s;s, is &s;unk into Earth as a common Man.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Popes were really Per&s;ons of &s;o much Perfection, &s;o infallible in their Decrees, &s;o replete with innate Holine&s;s, as Men here pretend; and on the other Hand, the deluded multitude did believe their <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> had but as much intere&s;t in the Coele&s;tial Paradi&s;e as we Mu&s;&s;ulmans be|lieve him to have, he would never &s;uffer any of their Popes to go into the Grave the common way of all Men, but would certainly tran&s;late them directly into Paradi&s;e, as <HI>Enoch, Elias,</HI> and him&s;elf were tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>But the Truth is, they know all this whole Sy&s;tem of the Pontificate, to be a meer Dream
<PB N="43" REF="63">
of the old deceitful Dervices, who made a Trade of Religion, to dive into the Pur&s;es of their Votaries; and it appears, becau&s;e their mo&s;t Holy Fathers or Popes are no more Im|mortal, than they are Infallible; from whence I infer, that they are no more Infallible, than they are Immortal.</P>
<P>This decea&s;ed Pope was one of the hone&s;te&s;t Men they have had in the Papal Chair this many Ages, if it may be allowed to call a Fa|ther of Lyes, an Impo&s;tor, and the Head of a Cur&s;ed Impo&s;ture, an hone&s;t Man; But to give him his due, he was hone&s;ter than any of tho&s;e who&s;e Character I have heard of; he was a ju&s;t inoffen&s;ive Man in his Morals, which very few of them are; and as to the pious Cheat of his Office, to give him his due, he left it ju&s;t where he found it. Whether he had any Faith in the Sy&s;tem, or no, I will not affirm, but am of Opinion that he had not, becau&s;e he had too much Penetration to be impo&s;ed upon; and yet I think he had too, becau&s;e he had too much Integrity to impo&s;e upon others. But that which reconciles the two Extremes is, that he was bred up in the Delu&s;ions, and perhaps receiv'd the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions &s;o deep, when young, that his Rea&s;on could not prevail over them afterwards. And if it was &s;o, it was no &s;trange thing in a Religion, wherein one of the principal Rules of Faith is, to have it follow tho&s;e who went before them; and va|lue their Doctrine rather for its Antiquity, than the intrin&s;ick of its Principles.</P>
<P>They called this Pope by the Name of <HI>Inno|cent</HI> XI. The <HI>Hugonots</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> every where cried him up, and he was called in gene|ral, <HI>The Prote&s;tant Pope;</HI> but this was principally on account of his Politicks, not his Religion;
<PB N="44" REF="64">
in the fir&s;t he was a Patron of Liberty, in the la&s;t a Tyrant, and Bigot. But with this Ex|planation in his favour, that in the fir&s;t, he acted Nature; in the la&s;t, he acted his Office.</P>
<P>They tell us a good Story of him here, which is an admirable proof of the genero&s;ity of his Nature, and the goodne&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition: The Story &s;ays, That an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman co|ming to <HI>Rome,</HI> and being de&s;irous to &s;atisfie his Curio&s;ity in &s;eeing the Pope, his Holine&s;s, as they call him, having &s;ome intimation that he was a Man of Learning, de&s;ir'd to talk with him; and u&s;ing very great freedom in his Di&s;|cour&s;e; among the re&s;t, &s;ays the Pope, if I mi&s;take not, I &s;aw you ye&s;terday at the &s;olemn Ma&s;s at St. <HI>Peters,</HI> &s;o they call the great Mo&s;que at <HI>Rome,</HI> where the Pope him&s;elf goes. Your Holine&s;s cannot mi&s;take, &s;ays the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gen|tleman, &s;miling. The Pope under&s;tood him, and found he had really committed a Mi&s;take, to &s;ay, if I mi&s;take not, when he is called Infal|lible; and that the Gentleman had touch't the Point in Repartee. However, being a Per&s;on full of good Humour, he carried that off; and turning to another Subject; well, &s;ays he, you &s;aw me in my Habits of Ceremony, what do you think now of the Pope's being Antichri&s;t? The Gentleman was full of the An&s;wer, but loth to give offence, and ask'd if his Holine&s;s would give him leave to &s;peak freely; with all my Heart, &s;ays the Pope, I promi&s;e you I will not be offended.</P>
<P>Why truly, &s;ays he, I will not affirm that the Pope is Antichri&s;t; but in my Country, if there had been a Hue-and-Cry after Antichri&s;t, and I had met your Holine&s;s in the Dre&s;s you were in ye&s;terday, I believe I &s;hould have ap|prehended you upon Su&s;picion.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="65">
The Pope, they &s;ay, receiv'd the Je&s;t with much good Temper, but did not talk much with the Per&s;on after it; and the <HI>Hugonots</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> make them&s;elves very merry with the Story.</P>
<P>They publi&s;h a Letter of Politicks in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which they &s;ay this Pope wrote to King <HI>James,</HI> when he &s;ought a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him a|gain&s;t the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> in which they &s;ay he blam'd him for offering to break thro' the Laws and Liberties of his Country, on pre|tence of introducing the Romi&s;h Religion; but the People here cannot bear to hear of that Do|ctrine, which they &s;ay condemns the King in that very thing for which he ought to be Canoniz'd.</P>
<P>In a word, Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> was for every Na|tion enjoying their own Con&s;titutions, and car|rying Religion on by Religious Methods, not by Force, Armies, and Per&s;ecution; but the Religion he call'd him&s;elf the Head of, would not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon that Bottom.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. To the Illu&s;trious Leader of the Armies of the invincible Emperor of the faithful <HI>Mehemet Orchanes Ogli,</HI> Vizier <HI>Azem.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Congratulate with an exce&s;s of Joy, thy ad|vancement to the high Command whereof thou art now po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; and as no Man knows better than thy &s;elf, how to execute the Office
<PB N="46" REF="66">
of prime Mini&s;ter in a State of &s;uch bound|le&s;s Dominion, &s;o no Man knows more of thy Merit and Capacity for the Dignity than I, who have been witne&s;s to the Greatne&s;s of thy Soul, and thy indefatigable applications to Virtuous and Glorious Actions from thy Child|hood. It is now, and at this di&s;tance, that I fore&s;ee thy Valour and Conduct will curb the In&s;olencies of the Infidels, and Enemies of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and re&s;tore to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire tho&s;e Towns, which not the Valour of the <HI>Ger|mans,</HI> but the Negligence and want of Experi|ence in former Officers, have &s;uffer'd to fall in|to their Hands.</P>
<P>Wherefore is it that the Court of the Grand Seignior has known &s;uch Changes, and that no le&s;s than &s;even Grand Viziers have been remo|ved in five Years pa&s;t. But that Fate, which has re&s;erv'd the retrieving the Glory of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire to a Hand and Head fitted by Nature for that Work, might not only bring thee to this high Station, but prepare for thee the Field of Victory and Peace.</P>
<P>I am not care&s;&s;ing thee for Gain, or &s;welling thy Vanity with words; <HI>Mahmut</HI> knows not how to be a Hypocrite; Flattery is the Sacri|fice of Fools, and a Gift that Wi&s;e and Great Souls abhor. But it is reveal'd to me from the &s;acred Hills of <HI>Be&s;&s;er, Abba,</HI> and the Cave of Wonders: <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;aid <HI>Amen,</HI> the Great Pro|phet joyn'd his Hands, and &s;houted: I heard the &s;ound in Vi&s;ion imperceptible, the Oracle &s;peaks by my Mouth, CUPRIOLI <HI>&s;hall glo|riou&s;ly end this War, the</HI> Infidels <HI>and</HI> Nazareens <HI>&s;hall &s;ue for Peace, and it &s;hall be given them.</HI></P>
<P>I live here in a Country of Enemies of <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> yet the King of <HI>France</HI> is both like thee in Glory, and like thee happy in the mo&s;t &s;u|blime
<PB N="47" REF="67">
Undertakings: he is un&s;haken in his Mi&s;|fortunes, and invincible in his Re&s;olutions; he receiv'd the la&s;t Year &s;everal Foils and Di&s;ap|pointments; his Enemies in &s;trong Confederacy took from him <HI>Maynce,</HI> or <HI>Mentz,</HI> an Imperial City, and an impregnable Fortre&s;s; <HI>Key&s;erlauter</HI> and <HI>Bonn</HI> al&s;o, two very &s;trong Towns, and with them large Countries depending on them.</P>
<P>But like <HI>Anteus,</HI> who the Poets feign was the Son of <HI>Terra,</HI> and had this benefit by his Birth, that when he was in wre&s;tling with <HI>Her|cules,</HI> thrown to the Earth, he ro&s;e up &s;even times &s;tronger than before; &s;o the King of <HI>France,</HI> made more furious by his Lo&s;&s;es, makes &s;uch preparations for an offen&s;ive War this Year, as the like is no where to be &s;een, but at the &s;tupendious Port where thou guide&s;t the Helm of Empire, and where all the Prin|ces of the Earth do Homage.</P>
<P>The Preparations here are incredible, and the King re&s;olves to take the Field in Per&s;on, the Dauphine is to Command a &s;econd and &s;eparate Army, and the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> the King's Brother, a third. Be&s;ides which, he re|&s;olves to have a Fleet of 100 Sultanas of the Line, that is, in the &s;peech of the Sea in this part of the World, of Men of War of 50 Guns and upwards, for no le&s;s Ships now fight in the Line of Battle.</P>
<P>The Face of the whole Kingdom is cover'd with Troops, and the Drums beat up in all parts; all the Di&s;cour&s;e is of Arms, and Equi|pages, and you would &s;wear that all the People of <HI>France</HI> were to repair to the Borders, to &s;ee the Fate of <HI>Europe</HI> decided. The Great Ci|ties and Towns are Tax'd at every one a Regi|ment of Soldiers, or le&s;s, according to their magnitude, which they report will amount to
<PB N="48" REF="68">
120 Regiments, which &s;hall bear their Names, and be Cloathed by the &s;aid Towns; and the Expence is to be re-paid in three Years after the Wars &s;hall be over, or perhaps not at all; for this King is not very nice in ob&s;erving the Promi&s;es which he makes, e&s;pecially tho&s;e to his own Subjects.</P>
<P>Fear and Courage in War attend bad or good Succe&s;s, as the Rain and Heat do the thickne&s;s or clearne&s;s of the Air, and the Hopes of Men ri&s;e and fall, ju&s;t as the Enemy they pur&s;ue, ri&s;es or falls before them. May early Succe&s;&s;es crown thy illu&s;trious Undertakings, that the ancient Courage of the Mu&s;&s;ulmans may revive in thy Glory, and Victory may be the Handmaid of thy Wi&s;dom, and Valour.</P>

<P>I Had no &s;ooner heard of the Advancement of my old Friend, Comerade and Acquaintance <HI>Mehemet Ogli,</HI> to the illu&s;trious Office of Grand Vizier, but it foreboded to me that the Affairs of the Glorious Empire of the World would take a new turn: Virtue and Magnani|mity po&s;&s;e&s;t him from a Youth, he was the de|light of Wi&s;e Men, and delighted in Valiant Men, and is now the choice of Wi&s;dom and Valour it &s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. To the mo&s;t Perfect in Wi&s;dom and Vir|tue, the upright In&s;tructor among the Faithful, <HI>Vahimi Effendi,</HI> Publi&s;her of Truth, and Teacher of Wi&s;e Sayings, in the pre&s;ence of the Grand Seignior.</HEAD>
<P>SURELY the Religion of the&s;e <HI>Nazareens,</HI> as they manage it here among their Der|vices, or Prie&s;ts, of whom there are innume|rable Sects, is the mo&s;t unaccountable ma&s;s of Contradiction that was ever heard of in the World. And to do ju&s;tice to the Lord of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who dwelleth in Unity, the great One God, who &s;ent his Pro|phet, the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> to in&s;truct the&s;e Men in the way of right things; I &s;ay, to do ju&s;tice to him, it mu&s;t be declar'd that they walk not in his Precepts, as the true Mu&s;&s;ulmen walk in the right Precepts of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>It would offend thy Ears, ennur'd to hear the Words of Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom, &s;hould I give thee the detail of the Folly and Madne&s;s of the&s;e Hypocrites; were their Prophet Je&s;us here now on Earth, to &s;ee the Hypocritical be|haviour of the &s;everal Sects of religious Thieves among them, and how they &s;ell Pardon of Sins for Money, and &s;end Souls into Torment, or Bli&s;s, as their Friends are narrow or large in their Bounty to their Church, he would &s;courge them out of the Mo&s;ques con&s;ecrated to his Name, as he did the Money-Changers out of the Temple; for never was it &s;o true as now, that his Hou&s;e is made a Den of Thieves.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="73">
But not only are the Religious among them a Crew of un&s;anctified Devotees, but the man|ner with which they carry on their Fraud, is in it &s;elf &s;o ridiculous, that nothing is more a&s;to|ni&s;hing, than that the People can be impos'd upon in &s;uch a manner, and can take &s;uch Ab|&s;urdities for Religion. For Example.</P>
<P>They Celebrate Yearly the Day of the Nati|vity of the Me&s;&s;iah Je&s;us. But as if they were determined by Fate to be made ridiculous to all the Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> they cannot re&s;olve a|mong them&s;elves when it was. So tenacious al&s;o they are of their &s;everal Epocha's of Time, and of the particular Accounts which one or other keep, that each Country keep it according to their own way; &s;ome ten Days &s;ooner, &s;ome ten Days later than one another; and in the <HI>Mu&s;covire</HI> Country, I am told, they have no le&s;s than 5 &s;everal Accounts.</P>
<P>In a word, they know not when he was born. And did not we know the certainty of the&s;e things, by the unerring Revelation of our ju&s;t Oracle the Alchoran, which came from Heaven, we might ask them how they knew he was Born at all, or that there was &s;uch a Per&s;on upon Earth. But we are able to give them a Truer Account of their own Prophet, who&s;e Pattern of Virtue we declare to them, would make them perfect, had they obey'd his Law with Sincerity and Faithfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Neither are they better in&s;tructed in the Nature and Rea&s;on of keeping <HI>Biram,</HI> or a Fea&s;t on the Day of the Nativity of the Son of <HI>Mary;</HI> for if they acknowledge him to be a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, then ought his Fol|lowers to practi&s;e according to his Example; and when they Celebrate his Birth, in whom they tru&s;t and believe, &s;hould it not be to re|commend
<PB N="54" REF="74">
his Law to one another, for the ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of their People.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Day of <HI>Biram,</HI> or Fea&s;t ob&s;erv'd for the Birth of their Prophet JESUS, is a Day &s;et apart for unbounded Licentious Vice, as Gluttony, Gaming, exce&s;s of Wine, and all manner of Liberty, in tho&s;e Crimes in which the&s;e Northern Nations &s;urmount even the wickedne&s;s of the Luxurious <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>I Swear to thee by the holy Soul of my Father and Grandfather, that there are not living in the Face of the Sun, &s;uch a Ge|neration of Belly-Gods as the Dervices of this part of the World, who, under pretence of Sanctity, Ab&s;tinence, and pro&s;e&s;s'd Poverty, wallow in Sen&s;uality, Gluttony, and Wine; and this is an aggravation of it, that the Day appointed to thank God for the Birth of their Great Prophet, is, as it were, &s;et apart to pro|voke God to take from them the benefit for which their Prophet Je&s;us came among them.</P>
<P>Nor is it in vain; righteous Vengeance has filled them with their own ways, and the Laws of Virtue and Truth, which Je&s;us the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> left them to walk by, when he was taken up into Heaven, are lo&s;t to them, being &s;wallowed up in Hypocri&s;ie and Innovation on one hand, Ignorance and Immorality on the other.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance of their Ignorance I &s;hall give thee in another Ca&s;e, in which they are mockt by their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eople: and this relates to another Day, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> they keep as a Day of Devotion for the Crucifixion of their Me&s;&s;iah; this they call <HI>Good-Friday;</HI> but why it has that Name, they cannot tell us, neither is it known by one in five hundred among&s;t them what it is they
<PB N="55" REF="75">
are to do on that Day, or how to behave; <HI>(viz.)</HI> whether with Joy, or Sorrow.</P>
<P>It was ye&s;terday that they Celebrated this Day in the Great Mo&s;que of this City, as al&s;o in all the le&s;&s;er Mo&s;ques; but I name the Great Mo&s;que, becau&s;e when the People came to go into the Mo&s;que, or Church; they found a Pa|per fix'd upon the Door, with the following Lines, in &s;everal Languages, that all &s;orts of People might read it.<Q><LG>
<L>Ye Hypocrites, pull off the Sacred Ma&s;que,</L>
<L>And of your &s;elves this graver Que&s;tion ask;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whether you are in Earne&s;t, or in Je&s;t,</L>
<L>Whether <HI>Good-Friday</HI> is a Fa&s;t, or Fea&s;t?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If as a Fea&s;t you keep the joyful Day,</L>
<L>You joy that <HI>Judas</HI> did your Lord betray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If 'tis a Fa&s;t, and all in Sorrow &s;eem,</L>
<L>You mourn that Je&s;us did the World Redeem;</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The People were &s;o a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Que&s;tion, which not any of them could an&s;wer, that they read them with great attention, and many took Copies of them; &s;o that it was to no purpo&s;e that the Bi&s;hop, hearing of it after|wards, &s;ent his Officers to pull the Paper down, for they were immediately made pub|lick over the whole City, and are repeated now in every Mouth with &s;uch plea&s;ure, that the Dervices are provok'd to the highe&s;t de|gree, being banter'd and je&s;ted with about them in all Conver&s;ation. Nay, I am told the King him&s;elf could not forbear repeating them by way of Je&s;t to his Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="76">
But that which made the greate&s;t Di&s;tur|bance was, that at the bottom of the Paper, there were three other Lines; upon the read|ing of which, it was ob&s;erv'd, abundance of the more &s;erious People began to con&s;ider whe|ther they had be&s;t go into the Mo&s;qe that Day or no, and many of them really went back again. The Lines were thus:<Q><L>Before you go to Church, re&s;olve the Doubt,</L>
<L>That you may know what you go there about,</L>
<L>And not go Wi&s;er in, than you come out.</L></Q></P>
<P>Had this happen'd in <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> or in <HI>Italy,</HI> it is certain whoever had dar'd to take a Copy of them, or to repeat them again, e&s;pecially by way of Je&s;t upon the Clergy, as they do here, would have been clapt up in the Inqui&s;ition, and never have come out, but at an <HI>auto de fe,</HI> with a <HI>San Benitto</HI> upon his Head. But the <HI>French</HI> are a People of &s;o much freedom in their general Conver&s;ation, that they could never &s;uffer the Yoke of the In|qui&s;ition among them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. To <HI>Simeon Ben Habbakkuk,</HI> a Jew, at <HI>Salonicha.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOU (my old Friend) art in my Opi|nion, &s;tudying and &s;pending thy Years, even to an extream Old Age, upon the weake&s;t Foundation that any Man of &s;o great Learning ever did, except an old Fryar here in <HI>France,</HI> who, they &s;ay, has been forty Years writing what he calls the Hi&s;tory of Sacred Reliques, they call him Father <HI>le Ple&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>He has made a Collection of the Trumpery they call Reliques, which they tell me are di|ge&s;ted into 17 Volumes in Folio; to which he has with much Labour added all that he could reckon up or gather, and perhaps in|vent, and having Dedicated them to Cardinal <HI>Ma|zarine,</HI> the Cardinal, who perhaps knew more of the Cheat than Father <HI>le Ple&s;is,</HI> ask'd him to let him &s;ee the whole Work, that he might cau&s;e them to be laid before the King, and obtain for him &s;ome mark of his Maje&s;ty's E&s;teem; the old Father tickled with this Compliment, brought his 17 Volumes in Manu&s;cript curi|ou&s;ly written to the Cardinal, who took care of the Fryar indeed, and made him an Abbay, as we &s;tyle them, <HI>Naki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> E&s;screff,</HI> or Chief of the <HI>Emirs;</HI> I &s;ay, he made him Abbay of a Mona&s;try of Fryars <HI>Benedictines,</HI> but ne|ver let him &s;ee his Books any more; and I am told, that after the Cardinal's Death, they were found in his Library, with this worthy remark upon them, under the Cardinal's own Hand, that they were a &s;candalous Medly of Ridicu|lous Tales, and ought to be &s;uppre&s;s'd:</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="78">
Be not angry, grave <HI>Simeon,</HI> if I think thou art &s;tudying and labouring, &s;pinning out thy Bowels, and employing thy fruitle&s;s Years in a production, which, when thou ha&s;t fini&s;hed, will be of no profit, either to thy &s;elf, or any one el&s;e; for as I have it from thy own Pen, thou ha&s;t been this 50 Years tracing An|tiquity, and the Learned Works of the He|brew <HI>Rabbins,</HI> to explain and come at the Ori|ginal of the <HI>Talmud,</HI> or Babylonian <HI>Gemara,</HI> the <HI>Mi&s;na,</HI> and the Lectures of the <HI>Gaonim,</HI> and <HI>Amo|raim, (viz)</HI> the Expo&s;itors and Doctors of the Oral Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Alas, <HI>Simeon,</HI> I pity thy fruitle&s;s Labour, thou ha&s;t gotten a Task endle&s;s as that of <HI>Sy&s;|&s;iphus,</HI> who was condemn'd to roll a great Stone up the Mountain <HI>Aeger,</HI> which came back upon him immediately upon every lift he gave it, and always left him ju&s;t where he began.</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable Man, thou would&s;t do well to tran&s;po&s;e thy Studies from the &s;ub&s;equent to the antecedent, and re&s;olve fir&s;t the previous Que&s;tion, Whether there was any &s;uch thing as an <HI>Oral Law</HI> committed to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> yea or no? and till thou do&s;t this, 'tis all but begging the Que&s;tion to talk of the Authority of the <HI>Mi&s;na,</HI> which in its pretence is a Body of Traditional Con&s;titu|tions.</P>
<P>But did ever Man of Learning &s;pend his in|valuable time, in &s;uch a fruitle&s;s Study as this? in which thou art &s;ure to arrive at nothing, but, in a word, to leave every thing more ab|&s;tru&s;e, dark and difficult than you found it.</P>
<P>I know it is in vain to urge to thee the words of Je&s;us the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> becau&s;e thy thoughts of him are not the &s;ame as we
<PB N="59" REF="79">
Mu&s;&s;ulmen entertain; for we believe him to be a Prophet &s;ent from God, but thou believe&s;t him to be an Impo&s;tor; we believe he was Tran&s;lated to Heaven, as was <HI>Enoch,</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> thou that he was Crucified; and that his Di&s;|ciples, the better to carry on the Religious Fraud, doz'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers with an Opi|ate in &s;ome Wine, and having ca&s;t them into a deep Sleep, had &s;tollen his Body away, and gave out that he was ri&s;en from the Dead.</P>
<P>But I &s;ay, not to mention the preaching of this Je&s;us, who expos'd &s;ufficiently the folly and knavery of your Traditions, and made even the Notion of an Oral Law ridiculous in it &s;elf; I &s;hall put thee upon this rational Enquiry, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whether <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> left any &s;uch Oral Law or not, and whether it does not appear rather to be the meer &s;ubtilty, craft and knavery of the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> pretending by &s;ugge&s;ting &s;uch antient In&s;titu|tions, and undertaking to explain and expatiate upon them, to gain reverence and re&s;pect among the People, and indeed making them&s;elves Law|givers; for it is evident that they have in the end given the &s;ame, or a &s;uperior Sancti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n, to the Tradition of the Elders, <HI>(viz)</HI> the <HI>Mi&s;na,</HI> the <HI>Babylonian Gemara,</HI> &amp;c. as was given to the written Law of God handed to them by the Mini&s;try of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> your great Prophet and Law|giver.</P>
<P>Now, Sage <HI>Simeon,</HI> what is the Evidence you have that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gave any Rules other than tho&s;e which he left in Writing? verily thou can&s;t neither give Evidence of it, or lay down any probable Scheme or Rea&s;on of it. To give Evidence, none will pretend, nor do the mo&s;t ancient Writers among the <HI>Hebrews</HI> go back to any time, when it can be &s;aid, by many hun|dred Years, that any was alive who receiv'd
<PB N="60" REF="80">
tho&s;e Oral Laws from the Mouth of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> the utmo&s;t Authority given by the Ancients, and with which your People &s;eem &s;o well &s;a|tisfied, is this, that they receiv'd it by Tradition.</P>
<P>The&s;e Traditions are collected by <HI>Rabbi Juda,</HI> a Learned Sage Man, but he goes no farther back than <HI>Simeon</HI> the Ju&s;t, who, by his acknow|ledgement, liv'd not till above a thou&s;and Years after the Death of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and knew nothing of what was left by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf, but what was upon Record in the Books called the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> except what was handed down to him by the Traditions, that is, in a word, the Corruptions of the Elders,</P>
<P>The&s;e Traditions then having no evidence of their Antiquity, thou woulde&s;t do well, after the mo&s;t curious &s;earch of Books, to re|&s;olve them as <HI>Gaffir Evilmouah,</HI> the Learned <HI>Arabian</HI> of <HI>Medina,</HI> did long &s;ince, into the cor|rupt Expo&s;ition of Dogmatick <HI>Rabbies,</HI> pre&s;u|ming, in Pride and O&s;tentation, to impo&s;e their &s;ence upon the Divine In&s;titutions of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who al&s;o, to add an Authority, tho' &s;ur|reptitious, and a&s;&s;umed, pretend that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;aid to leave &s;uch Con&s;titutions as explana|tions of the Laws of God; as if <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was guided by the e&s;pecial and particular Hand of Heaven, and had the pattern of every thing given him in the Mount, would not have been &s;o ju&s;t to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;o ju&s;t to God him&s;elf, as to have written, for their farther In&s;truction, every thing that had been nece&s;&s;ary for their perfect under&s;tanding the Law of God, if it had not been &s;ufficiently explain'd in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Farther, it &s;eems a reproach to God him&s;elf, if thou acknowledge&s;t him to be a perfect Law-giver, that he &s;hould leave his Laws in &s;o hidden and dark Expre&s;&s;ions, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Servant, hidden
<PB N="61" REF="81">
and by whom he promulgated the whole Tenour of his Will, &s;hould be oblig'd to add to it an Oral Law, as a Directory of its Obedi|ence, whereas in the re&s;t there was not a &s;titch in the Curtains of the Tabernacle, but what was particularly de&s;crib'd and directed from Heaven.</P>
<P>But to carry it yet farther; by the Tran&s;la|tion, as al&s;o by all the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Editions of the the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> which I have &s;een, the la&s;t Chapters of the la&s;t of tho&s;e Books, contain a recapitu|lation by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the People, of all that God commanded him to &s;ay to them; wherein he tells them the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the Com|mand, the plainne&s;s of it, and particularly, that it needs no Oral Expo&s;ition, or Addition. He makes indeed pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances to them for their ob&s;ervance of the Law, but does not &s;ay one word of its requiring an Interpreter, or any Explanations, Expo&s;itions, or particular Di|rections. On the other hand, your Prophet <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> declared that there needed no &s;uch helps, <HI>Deut.</HI> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14. <HI>For this Commandment which I command thee this Day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in Heaven, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ay, Who &s;hall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Nei|ther is it beyond the Sea, that thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, Who &s;hall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou maye&s;t do it.</HI></P>
<P>The meaning is clear, it is nigh to thee, fa|miliar to thy Under&s;tanding, it is in thy Mouth, that is, in thy own Mouth, thou neede&s;t no Teacher; and in thy Heart., thou neede&s;t no Explanation, no Interpreter. That thou maye&s;t do it; that is, thou knowe&s;t it per|fectly well, and can&s;t have no Excu&s;e for not doing it.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="82">
From hence it is ob&s;erv'd in the Hi&s;tories of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Times, that on all the publick So|lemnities among the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> the Law was to be read to the People, there was no occa&s;ion of Oral Expo&s;itions, and Traditional Additions, the Law was compleat, it wanted nothing but to be read to the People, it carried &s;uch Energy with it, and was in all things &s;o compleatly full, &s;o plain, &s;o intelligible, and &s;o convin|cing, that to read it was &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>What then art thou doing, O <HI>Simeon,</HI> thou art but raking in Dunghils, and &s;earching the corrupt attempts of frail and erroneous Men, to explain and expound the Law given in the mo&s;t perfect form from Heaven, by that God who cannot err, and who exhibited his Com|mands in &s;o perfect a form as needed no Expla|nations.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, Sage <HI>Rabbi,</HI> thou art &s;tudy|ing upon nothing, but art &s;urrounded with tho&s;e cur&s;ed <HI>Phaenomena</HI>'s of Human Inven|tions, which for many Ages have been Dark|ning and Eclip&s;ing, not explaining the pure and un&s;potted Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> your Lawgiver; and your <HI>Rabbins</HI> have been now a thou&s;and Years endeavouring to introduce their mean and debauch'd whym&s;ies into the &s;aid Law, as In&s;titutions of God, which is the wor&s;t &s;ort of Idolatry; ju&s;t as the <HI>Nazareens</HI> here have done, who, by the pretended Authority of the Popes, or Sovereign Pontiffs, have introduced &s;o many Oral Traditions into the Wor&s;hip of their Prophet, that they have very few of his fir&s;t In&s;titutions left among them.</P>
<P>Be Wi&s;e in the conclu&s;ion of thy Days, and leave off propagating Errors, and impo&s;ing Hu|man Inventions in the mo&s;t pure Laws of the High, One Eternal Being.</P>

<P>IF I judge rightly from what I have ob&s;erv'd from the Hi&s;tory of the Nations among whom I dwell; I think the mighty Empire of the <HI>Ot|tomans</HI> is the only Kingdom or Government in the World which God has &s;uffer'd to &s;tand protected by his Great Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> with|out &s;uffering the Revolutions common to the&s;e <HI>European</HI> Kingdoms.

But the Triumphant Empire of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> has from its fir&s;t Founder continued under the &s;ame Government, in the &s;ame Line, and in a continual encrea&s;e, like the growing Cre&s;|cent, the Ancient and Original Device of our great Prophet, growing towards its full, and has yet never &s;uffer'd any Wain; long may it encrea&s;e, 'till it Triumph over all the Nations of the World, and bring the haughty Empires of the <HI>Perfians,</HI> and <HI>Nazareens,</HI> to truckle to the Feet of the Grand Seignior.</P>
<P><HI>England,</HI> which among the Kingdoms of the <HI>Nazareens</HI> I ju&s;t now named to thee, to have al|ready &s;uffer'd Changes and Revolutions, has &s;uffer'd now about two Years ago, a greater Change than any of tho&s;e for Ages before; for they have depo&s;ed their Rightful Lord and Em|peror,
<PB N="64" REF="84">
and have, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Dutch Prince, called the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> driven their King not only from his Throne, but out of his Dominions, and we &s;ee him here as a for|&s;aken afflicted Man, taking Sanctuary in the Court of his Neighbouring Monarch, and &s;o|liciting him for Help.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> has always been vain of having his Court call'd the A&s;ylum, or Refuge of Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Princes, and has often e&s;pou&s;ed the Cau&s;e of &s;uch, to a degree which has been heavy upon him&s;elf; and yet has &s;o happily managed for &s;uch Princes, that many of them, fir&s;t or la&s;t, have been effectually re&s;tor'd; as was the Ca&s;e in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Braganza,</HI> now the Royal Hou&s;e of <HI>Portugal;</HI> &s;everal <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Ger|man</HI> Princes, and others; but he has had no luck with entertaining Kings of <HI>England:</HI> For when he entertain'd once the Brother of this Prince, many Years ago, when Exil'd by his rebellious People, he found him&s;elf oblig'd by the U&s;urper, to de&s;ire him civilly to withdraw out of his Dominions again.</P>
<P>But he has &s;o effectually e&s;pous'd this Prince, as to enter into a very terrible War in his be|half; in which the Intere&s;t of the Per&s;on I mention'd, who was <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> but is now &s;olemnly Crown'd King of <HI>England,</HI> has been &s;uch, among the other Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> that the greate&s;t part of Chri&s;tendom, <HI>as they call it,</HI> is entred into a Confederacy a|gain&s;t the <HI>French</HI> King, and la&s;t Year, it was thought, would have bidden fair for his ruine.</P>
<P>Not that I believe now they will all be able together to Ma&s;ter him, e&s;pecially if the Arms of the invincible Port do continue with Succe&s;s to divert the Power of <HI>Germany</HI> from falling in with the re&s;t; for the Armies of <HI>France</HI> are in|finitely
<PB N="65" REF="85">
numerous, and this Years Campaign has given a new turn to their Affairs, their Cavalry, which indeed mu&s;t be e&s;teem'd the be&s;t in the&s;e parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> are exceeding fine, and are led on by the mo&s;t enterprizing daring Officers in the&s;e parts of the World; and they again directed by Generals of the utmo&s;t Experience: nor have they ever yet come to any deci&s;ive Battle wherein the <HI>French</HI> Troops have not gain'd both the Glory, and the Field, and that chiefly by help of their Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true, the now King of <HI>England,</HI> as they call him, is a Prince that will never give it over, and that by his Intere&s;t, his Policy, and his Alliances, appears every Year &s;tronger and &s;tronger, even after the mo&s;t bloody Battles and Engagements.</P>
<P>This will not be the Ca&s;e in <HI>France;</HI> for tho' the number of his Officers is inexhau&s;tible, and if a thou&s;and Officers were kill'd in a Bat|tle, which has been the Ca&s;e more than once, yet there are &s;uch numbers of Gentlemen in his Army, ready to &s;upply their Places, equal in Bravery and Experience to tho&s;e that fall in the Battle, that the Lo&s;s is not felt.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;ome have &s;aid that it is a Convenience to him, that there may be room to gratifie the infinite numbers of depending Gentlemen, who&s;e Families expect to ri&s;e by the good For|tune of their Relations in the Army.</P>
<P>But it is not the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the common Soldiers, e&s;pecially the Infantry; for as mo&s;t of the Infantry are Foreigners of all Nations, e&s;pecially <HI>Germans, Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> and all tho&s;e Countries are now Leagued again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> if the&s;e old Veterane Troops are once broken and de&s;troy'd by long Service, he cannot &s;upply them again but
<PB N="66" REF="86">
with Native <HI>French;</HI> who, tho' the Cavalry are good beyond compare, yet the common People are &s;mall, weak Bodies, and not able to cope with the &s;trong heavy Bodied Troops of the Northern Nations.</P>
<P>Whoever therefore lives to &s;ee this War end, if it holds on many Years, as it is like to do, will &s;ee the <HI>French</HI> Infantry grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e by Service; whereas the Troops of other Nations grow better and better: the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they cannot be recruited with Men of the &s;ame Nations, and of the &s;ame Bravery and Ability, as they were made up of before.</P>
<P>But however, as things are now &s;tated, the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;eems to make him&s;elf terrible to all the Confederates, grows upon them in every Campaign, and is continually &s;urprizing Towns and Countries from them, by being earlier in the Field than their Armies can be gotten together; &s;o that he often forms a Seige in the beginning of the Year, and takes the Place, and lets his Army go into Quarters a|gain, before the Troops of the Confederates, which are to be fetch'd from the &s;everal Coun|tries where they are gone to Quarter, can be in the Field.</P>

The Animo&s;ity among the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> is &s;o great, and they pur&s;ue one another with &s;uch implacable Fury, that it looks as if they were firmly re&s;olv'd never to have peace with one another any more; but were to root tho&s;e they quarrel with from the face of the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are now at War with the <HI>Germans,</HI> as the Grand Seignior al&s;o is; and this War is carried on with &s;uch Cruelty and Rage, that nothing is more grateful to them here, than to hear of the Victories which the Mu&s;&s;ulmans Armies get over the <HI>Germans;</HI> and tho' Je&s;us the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> is their own Prophet too, yet when thou&s;ands of his Followers are cut down by the Sword of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> they Boa&s;t and rejoyce in the News, albeit at other times they &s;tyle the faithful Mu&s;&s;ulmans their com|mon Enemies.</P>

I &s;hall give thee one Piece of Advice in this Ca&s;e, which, as thou ha&s;t a Martial Genius, thou wilt not fail to accept for the <HI>Grand Seig|nior</HI>'s Service: The Hor&s;es of <HI>Barbary, Turco|mania,</HI> and <HI>Natolia,</HI> are of the fine&s;t Make, the mo&s;t beautiful in Shape, full of Mettle and Courage, of any in the <HI>Otteman</HI> Empire; but they are not equal in Strength to the cour&s;er and heavier Hor&s;es of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and of <HI>England;</HI> from all which Places the <HI>Germans</HI> draw the heavy Hor&s;es they now u&s;e: This Weight of Hor&s;e|fle&s;h is the Advantage in Battle, as the Manner of Fighting is now u&s;ed in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>It was about the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Moon of the la&s;t Year, called <HI>February;</HI> that the King of <HI>France</HI> re|viewed the Cavalry of his Hou&s;hold at <HI>Com|peigne,</HI> a Town on the Frontiers towards
<PB N="79" REF="99">
<HI>Flanders;</HI> and as the King, with the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> cau&s;ed the <HI>Gens d' Arms</HI> to march by his Coach, he took Notice, that many of their Officers were mounted upon the fine&s;t <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Jennets and Barbs that could be &s;een.</P>
<P>It was u&s;ual every Year, that the Troops were ordered to march immediately to <HI>Flanders</HI> from the Review in that Place; but after this Review, the King ordered them to Quarters, which greatly &s;urprized them; but they un|der&s;tood it better, when an Order came the next Day from the Mare&s;chal <HI>Boufflers,</HI> that the Officers of the <HI>Gens d' Arms</HI> &s;hould all change their Hor&s;es, and &s;hould be all mounted upon &s;tronger Hor&s;es, and 20 Days Time was given them to furni&s;h them&s;elves; which was ea&s;ily done in that Part of the Country: and it was but two Months after, when a Je&s;t was put upon the Hou&s;hold Troops and the Guards, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That all the <HI>Gens d' arms</HI> were mounted upon Coach Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>But they &s;oon found the Advantage in Acti|on, for adding the Size of the Hor&s;es to the Courage and Bravery of the Men, who are all cho&s;en out of the be&s;t Soldiers in the Army, they became a new Sort of People; and it is &s;een now, for no Troops can &s;tand before them.</P>
<P>Were the Grand Seignior's Cavalry thus mounted, the <HI>Germans</HI> could not cope with them; but as it is now, they tell one another here, that the <HI>Spahis</HI> are mounted to pur&s;ue, not to &s;ight; if they had &s;aid, to run away, not to fight, I could not contradict them; for my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to hear and &s;ee, and &s;ay nothing: But, I &s;ay, would the Grand Vizier mount his Troops with the large, heavy Hor&s;es of <HI>Thracia</HI> and <HI>Macedonia,</HI> of <HI>Trape&s;ond,</HI> and the
<PB N="80" REF="100">
Mountains of <HI>Bo&s;an</HI> and <HI>Mingrelia,</HI> tho' they &s;eem fitter to draw the Cannon, than mount the Troopers, yet the Advantage of it would &s;oon be found in the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t I am no Man of War, but as I &s;ee this Practice made u&s;e of here &s;o much to Advantage by Men of Experience, thou maye&s;t find Rea&s;on to make u&s;e of the Advice as a Secret, for the Service of the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI></P>

<P>IT is with inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy I look back upon tho&s;e few Days of my Youth, which I &s;pent in thy Arms; thou who wert a Fountain of Wi&s;dom and In&s;truction from thine Infancy, the Knowledge not of the Language of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> &s;o much as of the Learning of the <HI>He|brews,</HI> was thy fir&s;t Study; and I am not igno|rant of the Perfection thou art arriv'd to in &s;o many Years Application: I know that no humane Under&s;tanding can reach what thou art Ma&s;ter of in the traditional Wi&s;dom of the Prophets and Rabbies of ancient Times.</P>
<P>How ignorant are the <HI>Literati</HI> of the&s;e Parts of the World in this particular? that they think none of the Ages or Nations contemporary with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Elders, were Partakers with them of &s;acred Knowledge, or had communi|cated to them any Part of the divine In&s;tituti|ons, which the <HI>Jews</HI> call the written Law?</P>

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that even the <HI>Jews</HI> them|&s;elves, when they would &s;et forth the great Judgment and Under&s;tanding of their Law|giver <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> they &s;ay he was learned in all the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> whereas we like|wi&s;e know that the great Teachers of Science, and In&s;tructers of the South&s;ayers of <HI>Egypt</HI> were <HI>Arabians;</HI> and that the Source of all their Knowledge came orginally from <HI>Dh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">arajara, Gurbelhumar,</HI> and <HI>Jabin Halfarecha,</HI> the mo&s;t an|cient Doctors of <HI>Arabia,</HI> far elder than <HI>Omer</HI> and <HI>Zebdanna;</HI> under the Teachings of whom, the Sooth&s;ayers, Magicians, and other wi&s;e Men of <HI>Egypt,</HI> had their Studies, and went into the Southermo&s;t Parts of <HI>Arabia Foelix,</HI> to hear and learn In&s;truction from them&punc; So that for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to be learn'd in all the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> was neither le&s;s or more than to be a Pupil of the Pupils of the ancient, mo&s;t learned <HI>Arabians;</HI> in whom the Perfections of

Knowledge, in the fir&s;t Ages of Time, were trea&s;ured up, and from them extended all over the World; particularly from <HI>Arabia</HI> to <HI>Egypt,</HI> by the Doctors and learned or wi&s;e Men of tho&s;e Times; from thence, by the Learning of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to the <HI>Jews;</HI> and by other Hands to the Sages of the <HI>East;</HI> from whom the <HI>Grecians,</HI> (viz.) the Philo&s;ophers of <HI>Athens,</HI> and of other <HI>Grecian</HI> Countries, handed down and improv'd humane Knowledge to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and to all the other Nations of the World.</P>
<P>I cannot, Sage Regi&s;ter of humane Know|ledge, pa&s;s over here the Confe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Te&s;timony they give to the Truth I a&s;&s;ert, <HI>(viz)</HI> that the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, as well divine as humane, which was entru&s;ted from Heaven with Mankind in tho&s;e fir&s;t <HI>po&s;t diluvian</HI> Ages, as they are called, was committed immediately, and in a more than ordinary Portion, to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> above all the Nations of the World.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, the <HI>Jews</HI> acknowledge, in pub|li&s;hing to the World, among the Books which they call Sacred; The Book or Story of <HI>Job</HI> the patient: This Book is not only graced with being written in the mo&s;t &s;ublime Stile that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language was ever written in, and by which it appears that the ancient <HI>Hebrew</HI> was pre&s;erved in its highe&s;t Purity and Dig|nity of Expre&s;&s;ion; but it gives undoubted Te&s;timony to this great Principle, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that God revealed him&s;elf from Heaven to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> for by the Confe&s;&s;ion of all the Geo|graphers in the World, <HI>Job</HI> and his three Friends were <HI>Arabians:</HI> I &s;ay, that God re|vealed him&s;elf from Heaven to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> in the like, and perhaps every Way as glorious a
<PB N="84" REF="104">
Manner, as he did afterwards to the other Po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Tenour of that Book, which they call of <HI>Job,</HI> intimates &s;trongly a Supremacy of divine and natural Knowledge, infinite Tran&s;cendencies of Wi&s;dom &s;hine in every Part of it, all rational and &s;upernatural Powers are exerted, in the Significancy of Expre&s;&s;ion, the Pungency of Replies, the Beauty of Stile, the Vivacity of Expre&s;&s;ion; in the arguings of his Friends, and the Sufferings of him&s;elf, all generous Principles are urged, acted, and im|prov'd; the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Expo&s;tulations that can be conceived, break out from the Mouth of the grave Patriarch, under his &s;trong Pre&s;|&s;ures, as from a Spirit overwhelmed; yet tyed down to the Principles of Humility, Re&s;igna|tion, Penitence, and all the Graces of a reli|gious Mind; and all the&s;e appear in a re&s;plen|dent Manner, even unutterable in any Language &s;ince that time known in the World: Nay, even unutterable in the very &s;ame Language, by any other Mouth.</P>
<P>No Example like it can ever be produced, thro' the whole Hi&s;tory of Time among the <HI>Jews,</HI> even by their own Confe&s;&s;ion; Now <HI>Job,</HI> by all the De&s;criptions that can be given, was an Inhabitant of the Land of <HI>UZ:</HI> This <HI>UZ</HI> is, according to their own Doctors, a Country denominated from <HI>UZ,</HI> the Grand&s;on of <HI>Noah,</HI> by his Elde&s;t Son <HI>SHEM;</HI> who&s;e Po&s;terity mul|tiplying after their coming out of the Ark, extended them&s;elves <HI>Southward</HI> into the mo&s;t fruitful Countries of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> &s;uch as <HI>India, Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tward</HI> into <HI>Syria, Dama&s;cus</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> ju&s;tly called the happy; and their happy Po&s;terity are &s;eated to this Day, abounding in Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, and con&s;ummated in the great Law|giver,

<P>How cometh it to pa&s;s, that thou, who art the right Hand to him, who is the right Hand of Councils, and keeps the Secrets of the mighty Empire; &s;hould not inform me at this Di&s;tance, of the great Turns in the Admini|&s;tration &s;ince the la&s;t Year; how the new Vizier has been exalted, and how to &s;hew him&s;elf illu&s;trious, and great in Action as in Council, he has re&s;tored Victory to the Arms of the Grand Seignior, by fighting the Battle of <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> and cutting in Pieces above 12000 of the Infidel Troop</P>
<P>It is true I hear all this, and am able to &s;end thee Particulars which thou knowe&s;t not of; but this is owing to the Intelligence I keep in the Courts and Councils of Princes, who are Enemies to the Grand Seignior, and therefore
<PB N="87" REF="107">
cannot always prevail with them&s;elves to &s;peak the Truth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, ha&s;t thou no &s;ympathetick Sen&s;e of the Joys or Griefs of an ab&s;ent Parent? That would be to &s;uppo&s;e, that thou ha&s;t none of the Blood of thy Father's Brother in thee; or that He and I having the &s;ame Father and Mother, thou had&s;t &s;till no Part of us com|municated by Generation, tho' by the Laws of Nature, which change not, the volatile Par|ticles of thy Blood, maintain an invi&s;ible Cor|re&s;pondence with tho&s;e of thy Father's Father, who was my Father; whereby thou inherite&s;t the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions, Temper, Fire, and Phlegm, and &s;halt act in Con&s;onance to the Humour and Con&s;titution of us that went before thee, even involuntarily, and by a natural Force of &s;ympathetick Powers, which thou maye&s;t not perceive.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Rule thou art of Nece&s;&s;ity in|&s;pired with the generous Principles of thy Grandfather, and can&s;t not be unmindful of thy Father's Image, who is now, tho' thus di|&s;tant and remote, the neare&s;t Parent to thee in Blood; and in who&s;e Affection thou ha&s;t &s;o great a Share, that by Sympathy it is impo&s;|&s;ible for us to be unconcern'd in the Griefs or Joys of one another, which Griefs or Joys, tho' unknown to either, are communicated by the invi&s;ible Conver&s;e of Spirits.</P>

<P>I Have received thy welcome Letter, which is the more &s;o, becau&s;e it &s;ignifies to me in &s;o many Words that this Expre&s;s is &s;ent me by the particular Order of the Grand Seig|nior him&s;elf. The Words were no &s;ooner &s;ounded by my Voice, but, without being able to read any farther, I turned my Face to|wards the happy Shades of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed the Memory of our great Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> wa&s;hing my &s;elf with Water, and making my Prayers in Form, as for the greate&s;t Occa&s;ion that could befal me, and which commanded Wor&s;hip and Thank&s;giving with the highe&s;t Reverence and Joy of a true Believer.</P>
<P>Kings, the mortal Gods on Earth, acting by the &s;ame Methods of Ju&s;tice and Benignity as the mighty Soveraign of the World, tho' in a different Proportion, command the &s;ame Reve|rence and Homage, in a due Proportion like|wi&s;e from tho&s;e upon whom they plea&s;e to &s;hine.</P>
<P>It is not a common Thankfulne&s;s which &s;uch Beams of Favour command from Subjects; the Benignity is of a &s;acred Original; the Ho|mage partakes of the &s;ublime; and, next to our Adoration, of the One God, Father of Life, and the Rewarder of the true Believers; our mo&s;t perfect Submi&s;&s;ions and mo&s;t pro&s;trate Affe|ctions are due to the &s;hining Glory of our im|perial
<PB N="94" REF="114">
Benefactor, Image of Glory, and &s;upream Fountain of Splendor upon Earth, the Mirror of illu&s;trious Light, and the true Repre&s;entative of inconceivable Brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>This Duty I perform from my Soul: I am exalted to a &s;ublime Joy, unequall'd by any thing on this Side the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lden Gates of Para|di&s;e I am lifted up in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ra&s;ies of inward De|lights unexpre&s;&s;ible; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">m a Fountain, flow|ing Streams of pure Affection, Obedience, and unbya&s;s'd Duty, to the Intere&s;t, Service, and Per&s;on of the great Lord of the Kings of the Globe, the Emperor of the Faithful.</P>
<P>'Tis a Heaven on this Side Paradi&s;e to &s;erve &s;o glorious a Ma&s;ter; to die in his Service is to inherit the brighte&s;t Circle of <HI>Eden,</HI> and to be tran&s;ported immediately into the Garden of inexpre&s;&s;ible Delight.</P>
<P>Our immortal Sultan has not a more faith|ful Slave in the Extent of his unbounded Em|pire than <HI>Mahmut,</HI> who has &s;erv'd with an inviolable Fidelity almo&s;t fifty Years in a Sta|tion equally unhappy as unplea&s;ant; but it is more than a Reward to all tho&s;e Services, that I am at la&s;t favoured with having my Name mention'd by the Mouth of him who is clo|thed with Glory, and over&s;hadowed with the Light of the eternal Benediction.</P>
<P>The Sum of Money thou ha&s;t likewi&s;e &s;ent me by Bills upon the Banquier of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at the Port, however great my Ne|ce&s;&s;ities are, is in no Compari&s;on equal to the Solace of thy Letter, as being &s;ent by Order of the Emperor of the World.</P>
<P>I pro&s;trate my &s;elf on the Ground, and ki&s;s the happy Du&s;t, at the Feet of our re&s;plendent Emperor, offering up ten Thou&s;and Prayers for the eternal Felicity of the Beloved of God,

and I demand of thee to do Ju&s;tice to <HI>Mah|mut,</HI> in returning the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Acknow|ledgments of a devoted Slave.</P>
<P>But after all this had lifted up my Soul be|yond the Power of its conceiving, and I &s;tood dumb and mute as one in a Trance, dazled with the Glory of the great Sultan's Favour; I was yet farther &s;urpriz'd with the happy News of the Progre&s;s of the victorious Arms of our Emperor, under the Leading of the Grand Vizier in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and the amazing Account of the Recovering the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Bel|grade</HI> out of the Hands of the Infidel <HI>Germans:</HI> So much good News together was too much for an old Man to bear; and fainting under the Weight of exuberant Joy, I made good that Saying of the Ancients, <HI>(viz)</HI>
<Q><L>That &s;udden Joys, like Griefs, confound at fir&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>It has been a Pain to me, illu&s;trious and happy <HI>Solyman,</HI> that I have been obliged to keep my Letters thus long, in return to thine, which came to me with &s;uch Expedition, that I had, contrary to all the U&s;age of &s;uch things, the News of the taking of <HI>Belgrade</HI> from thy Hand before it arriv'd here by Expre&s;&s;es from <HI>Vienna.</HI> The &s;wift Chaioux, who brought, on the Wings of Joy, the plea&s;ing News to the Em|peror, brought a Ble&s;&s;ing from <HI>Mahomet</HI> with the Report of a Victory, fair Winds and a quick Pa&s;&s;age join'd to di&s;per&s;e the Tidings to all the World, the Ve&s;&s;el which brought the happy Account pa&s;t with a &s;urprizing Pace, and perform'd, in &s;even Days, her Voyage from the happy Port, the Centre of circling Commerce, to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> from whence the Po&s;t brought me thy Letters in nine Days more by Land.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. To <HI>Morat Abdomozar Ephie&s;man Oglou,</HI> a Student in the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOU that ha&s;t &s;pent thy Years in the Study of the my&s;terious Vi&s;ion, and art Ma&s;ter of the &s;ecret Interpretation; tell me where will the Super&s;tition of the <HI>Nazareens</HI> end? who, while they pretend to be the mo&s;t devout among the Servants of the Me&s;&s;iah, are the bu&s;ie&s;t People in the World to per&s;wade them&s;elves out of all Sen&s;e of Religion in the World.</P>
<P>Where &s;leeps eternal Ju&s;tice? and how far may Nations &s;trive with Heaven, in&s;ult the Being of the God of Nature, and call aloud for the ju&s;t Retribution of their Crimes, and yet &s;low Vengeance not be prevailed with to exert its Power, and to de&s;troy them? no not at their own Reque&s;t!</P>
<P>What is the Puni&s;hment, righteous <HI>Morat,</HI> if any Mu&s;&s;ulman &s;hould be &s;o far degenerate as to deny the Being of the great One God! what &s;ays our great Prophet, who&s;e Law teaches upright things?</P>
<P>I know thou wilt an&s;wer as the Philo&s;opher <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> the Lawgiver of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> did, when it was ask'd him, why he had appointed no Puni&s;hment for Parricide, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that it was a Crime not to be named among his Citizens, and therefore needle&s;s to be enacted or provi|ded again&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="118">
Sure, of all the Religions that were ever erected by the Wit of Men, and of all the Gods that have been adored among the Hea|then, never any People deviated into the&s;e Di&s;putes about them before, all the idolatrous Nations in the World have retained this as a fir&s;t Principle, <HI>Nulla Gens tam barbara, quae ne&s;cit e&s;&s;e Deum.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> the Wor&s;hipers of the Me&s;&s;iah, have run &s;uch Divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, and rais'd &s;o many Quarrels about Religion, that they are at la&s;t willing to think they have been all along in the Dark, and that there is no &s;uch thing as Religion in the World, or any &s;uch thing as a God to be wor|&s;hiped. In a Word, they have phylo&s;ophiz'd &s;o long about their God, and how to call him, that they have quite lo&s;t him, and are daily que&s;tioning among one another whether there really is any &s;uch thing or no in the World.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain than the Vanity and Perplexity of School-Di&s;putes, Men may di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves into, and out of any Opi|nion or Religion in the World; but among all the &s;orts of Infidels that ever infe&s;ted the World, the&s;e Chri&s;tians, as they would be call|ed, are arriv'd to the highe&s;t Pitch of Infide|lity; for they are now come to re&s;olve all Religion to be a Politick Cheat, Notions of a God to be a Craft of the Schoolmen, and, in a Word, to deny the Beginning and End of all things.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men are arrived to a Degree of Crime which Lucifer, the great Angel and Prince of the dark abode, never pretended to; the exten|&s;ive Knowledge of Devils forbids that they &s;hould once &s;ugge&s;t to them&s;elves the Non-Exi&s;tence of that Being, who&s;e Power they feel

in pungent Torture, invincible and inconcei|vable; nor are there any Athei&s;ts in the I&s;lands of Perdition: Tho&s;e who have pa&s;s'd the Gulph into the Aby&s;s of Plagues and Darkne&s;s, are too well convinc'd by their Mi&s;eries of the Reality of that Being which they before deni|ed.</P>
<P>But 'tis in vain to talk to the&s;e Men, who, nothing but the Sables of Tophet, can unde|ceive, they laugh at the local Pri&s;ons, de&s;pi&s;e being &s;ubject to Torment, ridicule the Notions of a God, a future State, and all that which wi&s;e and good Men believe concerning Rewards and Puni&s;hments; 'tis of no Force to tell them they out-&s;in the Devil, and that the King of the eternal Pit believes, nay, knows, with Hor|ror, the Beatitudes which he is excluded from; for they believe as little of a Hell as they do of a Heaven, and own no Devil any more than they do a God.</P>
<P>Divine <HI>Morat,</HI> this is a Sin not to be nam'd, or to be found among Mu&s;&s;ulmen; it is the ju&s;t Di&s;tinction of the Righteous that they are Believers, that they know there is One God, that he is but One, and that <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his Pro|phet.</P>
<P>All the Cele&s;tial Chapters of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that divine Oracle which came down from Heaven, are introduced <HI>in the Name of God Gracious and Merciful.</HI> We are therefore called the faithful Mu&s;&s;ulmen, becau&s;e believing in One God; to ra&s;e out the Name and Belief of God out of the Mind, is to apo&s;tatize from our Faith, and, as it were, to become a Chri&s;tian; for among them only are Athei&s;ts to be found, among them alone are to be found Men ve&s;ted with rea|&s;oning Powers and Faculties, yet denying the Be|ing

<HEAD>LETTER XXV. To the Prince of the Servants of God, Guide of the Faithful, Mirror of Wi&s;dom and Council; the venerable <HI>E&s;ad,</HI> high in the Favour of the Grand Seignior and our great Pro|phet <HI>Mahomet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' it is not the mo&s;t agreeable Thing in the World to write to thee of War, and of fighting, who art the Lamp of Truth, and the Guide to Peace; yet the Story of daring Vertue, taking Arms in their Hands for Truth and Right, is &s;o much within thy Sphere, that I cannot doubt it will be plea&s;ing to thee.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> an enterprizing Prince, and one who has too long fallen into the <HI>French</HI> Methods of Government, (or rather religious Tyranny) over his Subjects, had &s;ome Years ago bani&s;hed an innocent, inoffen&s;ive, and gal|lant People, out of his Dominions, becau&s;e of their refu&s;ing to comply with &s;ome of the Ceremonies and Formalities of the Wor&s;hip of that Part of the <HI>Nazareen</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion, call'd <HI>Catholick</HI> or <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e People were Inhabitants of the Vallies, &s;cituate among the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Parts of the <HI>Alpine</HI> Mountains; tho&s;e &s;tupendious Hills do not, like our <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> or Mount <HI>Hemus,</HI> run on in a continued Ridge and Chain of Rocks, but they often break off abrupt, and &s;tanding
<PB N="102" REF="122">
up in high Pyramidical Precipices, and inac|ce&s;&s;ible Steeps, leave Intervals of the deepe&s;t Valleys; which being thus walled about by unpa&s;&s;able Hills, are indeed natural Fortifica|tions of them&s;elves: The Inlets into the&s;e are &s;o difficult, and in &s;ome Parts &s;o impracticable, that 100 Men have been known to be able to defend one of them again&s;t ten thou&s;and; but when one is entered, tho' the Hills and Moun|tains with which they are &s;urrounded, &s;eem to touch the Stars, yet the Valleys are the mo&s;t agreeable, plea&s;ant, fruitful, and habitable Places imaginable.</P>
<P>The People of the&s;e Valleys are a painful, hone&s;t, indu&s;trious People; al&s;o daring and brave to the la&s;t Degree: Subjects generally to the King of <HI>France</HI> or the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> till one comes further <HI>North,</HI> when the Vales are larger and more populous, being the Re|mainders of the ancient <HI>Helvetians,</HI> conquer'd by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and now called the <HI>Swi&s;s Can|tons.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Vaudois,</HI> &s;o they are call'd, from the <HI>Pais de Vaux,</HI> or Valleys, are not only of the Sect of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> called <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> but they boa&s;t that they embraced the Chri&s;tian Religion from the pure and primitive Times of it; when it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd the pure Doctrine of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> was more &s;incerely adhered to, than it has been &s;ince the Papal Hie|rarchy; for &s;ince that, it has been corrupted with Traditions, Innovations, and humane Inven|tions, till it is quite degenerated into a Ma&s;s of Error and Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had, as I &s;aid, bani&s;hed the&s;e People out of their Habitations, taken from them their Sub&s;tance, E&s;tates, Habitations, and even from &s;ome, their Children; driving
<PB N="103" REF="123">
them to &s;eek their Bread in Foreign Countries, where the Charity of other People might &s;up|port them: In this Condition they fled to <HI>Geneva</HI> and the <HI>Swi&s;s Cantons,</HI> being the neigh|bouring <HI>Helvetia,</HI> which I ju&s;t now named, where they were well receiv'd, harbour'd, reliev'd, and permitted as well as a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ettle; nor had they any View of being re&s;tored, e&s;pecially while the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Savoyard</HI> acted again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t in Concert with one ano|ther.</P>
<P>But now, &s;eeing the World embarra&s;&s;ed in War, and not &s;o good an Under&s;tanding be|tween the <HI>French</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> as u&s;ed to be, but rather a Pro&s;pect of wor&s;e; they form'd one of the mo&s;t de&s;perate and diffi|cult De&s;igns among them&s;elves, that for &s;uch a Handful of Men to undertake was ever heard of, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to force their Way back to their own Habitations Sword in Hand, and to re&s;olve to dwell there, in Defiance of the Duke their Lord and Per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>The Duke had Notice of it, and took all po&s;&s;ible Precaution again&s;t it, which added to the Difficulty: for they had therefore in Con|&s;equence &s;everal Detachments of Forces to encounter in the Way, be&s;ides the un&s;urmount|able Difficulty of Want of Provi&s;ions, Carri|ages, Money, or Troops, and the exceeding Length and Roughne&s;sof the Way.</P>
<P>But all this did not di&s;courage them from making the Attempt, which they &s;et on Foot with all the Secre&s;ie, and executed with all the Vigour and Succe&s;s imaginable; &s;o that the World are even &s;urprized at the Relation of it; which take as follows, for it is well worth thy hearing.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="124">
They had &s;ome Friends, and the <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> at lea&s;t tho&s;e Cantons profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Opi|nions in Religion, wink'd at them, if they did not a&s;&s;i&s;t them; but the principal En|couragement they had was from the new King of <HI>England,</HI> from whom it was &s;aid they re|ceived 100000 Livres, to furni&s;h them with Arms and Provi&s;ions; encouraged with which Supplies, and Hopes of greater A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they carryed on the De&s;ign with wonderful Se|cre&s;ie.</P>
<P>The particular Number which was to have remov'd, was actually three thou&s;and, as I have &s;een by their Li&s;ts; but he that was to have paid their Money, not having allowed them Time &s;ufficient for &s;uch a Num|ber, there was not above half were ready again&s;t the Day prefixed for their Depar|ture.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the De&s;ign being blown Abroad, about twelve hundred that were in a Po&s;ture to march, re&s;olved to &s;tay no longer, for Fear of meeting Ob&s;tacles in their Way: To this Purpo&s;e they cro&s;s'd the Lake of <HI>Geneva</HI> in the Night, unperceived by the <HI>Savoyards;</HI> &s;o that they had Time to get a Shoar, to range them|&s;elves in Order of Battle, and &s;end four hun|dred Men to inve&s;t two Neighbouring Villa|ges, before they were di&s;cover'd; upon this the <HI>Savoyards</HI> took the Alarm, and were run|ning to ring their Bells backward; but being threatned with Fire and Sword, they let them pa&s;s, and furni&s;hed them with Nece&s;&s;aries for their Money; they cro&s;s'd the River <HI>Arva</HI> with|out Mole&s;tation, in regard they had been &s;o wary as to &s;end away a Detachment to make &s;ure of the Pa&s;s; but tho' they met with no Trouble at the Beginning, they found enough
<PB N="105" REF="125">
afterwards; for the Courts of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>France</HI> being informed of their Motion, did all they could to &s;top them in &s;everal narrow and dange|rous Pa&s;&s;es, thro' which they were obliged to force their Way; however they &s;urmounted all the&s;e Difficulties, &s;till cutting their Pa&s;&s;age thro' their Enemies with the Edge of their Swords: They endured the Brunt of four or five Skirmi&s;hes, of which the &s;harpe&s;t was their Encounter with the Marquis of <HI>Larre,</HI> who would needs put a Stop to them near a Place called <HI>Salber|tran;</HI> having along with him for that Purpo&s;e a Regiment of Dragoons, and a good Number of the Militia; neverthele&s;s, after a &s;mart Con|flict, wherein they lo&s;t &s;ome Men, they forc'd the Pa&s;&s;age, as they had done the re&s;t; the Marquis was mortally wounded, &s;everal other Officers lo&s;t their Lives, and above two hun|dred <HI>French</HI> Soldiers were &s;lain: Afterwards having vanqui&s;h'd all Oppo&s;ition, they arriv'd happily in their own Country; from whence they chaced the old Catholicks, but now Inha|bitants, and found great Plenty of all Things nece&s;&s;ary for humane Support; tho&s;e of the Valley of <HI>Pragelas,</HI> tho' Subjects of <HI>France,</HI> and the new Converts, received them with open Arms, and now bring them whatever they &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>After this, &s;everal Bodies of them attempted to follow their Friends, particularly one of 2300 Men; but were &s;o unfortunate as to be repul&s;ed in &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes, and obliged at la&s;t to retire.</P>
<P>Sage Prince of &s;ublime Thoughts, thou wilt &s;ee here, how far Zeal carries the Profe&s;&s;ors of any Religion, whether true or fal&s;e, to pu&s;h even to De&s;peration and Death; according to a famous Expre&s;&s;ion of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writer, who

<P>With how much purer Flame does the Zeal of the Faithful burn, which carries them on the Wings of &s;age Councils, to undertake the greate&s;t Actions.

<P>If this Joy encrea&s;es upon me, I know not how long humane Nature may find it &s;elf able to bear the Weight; who knows the Power of in&s;upportable Felicity? It is a certain Te|&s;timony that we are to be &s;omething el&s;e than what we now are, before we can be capable of receiving the full Stream of the Joys of Para|di&s;e.

<P><PB N="110" REF="130">
Believe me, <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> the Joy I conceive at my approaching Remove is often too great for me to contain; &s;ometimes it vents it &s;elf in Exclamations of Joy, &s;ometimes in the mo&s;t frantick Ge&s;tures of a Lunatick, &s;ome|times it breaks out at the Eyes, and abates its weighty Pre&s;&s;ure in a Flood, not Tears of Grief, but of inexpre&s;&s;ible Exultation: It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe to thee the waking Vi|&s;ions, and the &s;leeping Di&s;cour&s;es I have of the&s;e things.

<P>In the mean time, I'll tell thee from Experience, that 'tis the mo&s;t unhappy Part of Life to be without a Friend to unbo&s;ome the Secrets of the Soul to.

them; if he is oblig'd to keep them in the narrow Bounds of his own Thoughts, and has no Liberty to give them vent by the Tongue, they will &s;tifle and overwhelm; even Life it &s;elf mu&s;t &s;ink under the Weight, and the Soul would ha&s;ten the neare&s;t way thro' that Aby&s;s to pa&s;s to the Regions of Light, of which &s;he her &s;elf is a Native.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophers here entertain us with Scruples concerning the Soul's pa&s;&s;ing the in|finite inconceivable Space, which we call Aby&s;s, being the Gulph plac'd between Time and Eternity, and from thence argue them&s;elves into Notions as ab&s;urd in Philo&s;ophy, as tho&s;e they have in Religion, and as that of a Plura|lity or Family of Gods; after they have told us how far the cele&s;tial Con&s;tellations of Light move from one another, that even the Planets are &s;ome of them 300 to 500 Millions of Miles from this lower Planet the Earth, and that yet they are far nearer to us than they are to the lowe&s;t of the other fix'd Stars above them; that tho&s;e other fix'd Stars are &s;till placed in advanced Stations above one another, every Stage infinitely di&s;tant from one another in Space; the Vacancies of which Aby&s;s afford Space &s;ufficient for the mighty Commets, which moving in Parabolas, and Excentrick, uncertain, or at lea&s;t unknown Motions, make Revolutions which 'tis difficult to a&s;certain, and therefore fill the World with Terror at their Appearances, and perhaps are re&s;erved as the In&s;truments of the general Con|flagration, as &s;ome one or more of them cer|tainly was of the general Inundation or Flood; (if &s;uch a thing may obtain our Belief,) of which <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Lawgiver of the <HI>Jews,</HI> gives

the Story. I &s;ay, after they have told u the&s;e things, they would &s;tart a doubt how the Souls of Men, at their being di&s;mi&s;s'd from the Pri&s;on of the Body, pa&s;s this infinite Aby&s;s of Space; how they are conveyed, and how directed in their Journey, where no Track can guide the way? and in what Space of time they perform the cele&s;tial Journey? &s;eeing they tell us that the Di&s;tance is &s;o great, that a Velocity of Motion, &s;wift as a Ball from a Cannon, would not perform the Labour in a Million of Ages.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Enquiries and &s;ugge&s;ted mea&s;u|rings of Space, Motion, and Time, have a Tincture of tho&s;e horrid Crimes of Athei&s;m and Sceptici&s;m, for which the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> are as eminent as infamous, and in which they en|crea&s;e every Day.</P>
<P>To a Soul rightly grounded in Truth and unerring Doctrines, it is ea&s;ie to conceive that the Soul of Man, being a divine Infu&s;ion, is capable of inconceivable Tran&s;itions; that its Motion, &s;wift as the Light, or as Thought, is no &s;ooner broke loo&s;e from the Pri&s;on, but it is enthroned in the Paradi&s;e of God; and that without any Solici&s;m in Philo&s;ophy, or Impo&s;ition upon our Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>How this is perform'd, illuminated &s;age Guide of the Faithful, is as needle&s;s as it is impo&s;&s;ible to know: <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;hall at once teach us the full Sy&s;tem, and draw the Curtain of Darkne&s;s from our Eyes the Moment that we arrive at the Port of Bli&s;s, when we &s;hall look back upon the immen&s;e Gulph we &s;hall have pa&s;s'd, and wonder no more that &s;ome, things were concealed from us before, which were more ea&s;ie to be done than for us to conceive of.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. To <HI>Mahomet Ter&s;hekkah,</HI> Vizier <HI>Azem.</HI></HEAD>
<P>INvincible illu&s;trious Prince of the Viziers, Ba&s;&s;a of the Ba&s;&s;aes, Beglerbeg of the Beg|lerbegs, Head of the Councils in the &s;ublime Divan of the Grand Seignior; Leader of the faithful Armies, and Guide of the Empire of the Mu&s;&s;ulmen, I pro&s;trate my &s;elf at the Feet of our Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to obtain his Ble&s;&s;ing and Prayers on all thy Undertakings, and I congratulate thy Glory in thy early vigorous Conduct again&s;t the Enemies of the <HI>Ottoman Sultan,</HI> who&s;e Days be ever pro&s;perous, and his End happy.</P>
<P>I &s;end thee herewith an Account of the Fate of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Ene|mies of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> and one to whom Heaven, for our Sins, gave leave to triumph over the Troops of thy great Predece&s;&s;ors <HI>Ha&s;&s;an, Kara,</HI> and <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, which be for ever forgotten; and the Memory of them blotted out of the Book of <HI>Jatub,</HI> where are regi&s;ter'd the Wars of the Empire, (ever happy) and in who&s;e Place be recorded the Victories ob|tained by thy Sword fortunate and invincible.</P>
<P>This Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> follow'd by great Ar|mies, and taking the Advantage of the Cloud of Di&s;plea&s;ure, which it was God's Will &s;hould, for &s;ome Years, hang over the Kingdoms of the Grand Seignior on the Side of the River <HI>Da|nube,</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="135">
obtained &s;ome Advantages again&s;t the Faithful, for&s;aken at that Time of the Prote|ction of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and made his Name terrible among the Infidels by the taking from us, how|beit not till after infinite Slaughter of his Men, and a mo&s;t glorious Defence, the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> which be recovered immediately by thy Hand.</P>
<P>He was now drawn out of that War again&s;t us, that he might with a Fury needful, a|gain&s;t an Enemy &s;o dangerous, defend the Do|minions of the <HI>German</HI> Empire, again&s;t the Attacks of the <HI>French,</HI> who daily made Inrodes into the Country, and threaten'd the De&s;tru|ction of the whole: This great Man, for he really merited that Name among all the Leaders of Armies, of whom none in this Part of the World came near him in Character, or rather in Succe&s;s, for Succe&s;s does not always follow the greate&s;t Merit; I &s;ay this great Man is at length laid level with his Inferiors in the Du&s;t, for the Grave knows no Dignity.</P>
<P>Take the Hi&s;tory of his Death in a few Words, for it was brief; Death u&s;ed no Ce|remonies with him. He had for &s;ome time had a Defluxion or Rheum in his Brea&s;t, occa&s;ion|ed by a violent Cold gotten in pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome Mountains, in his Return from the Frontiers on the <HI>Rhine;</HI> where he had been to take Care of the Emperor's Affairs, and put all things in a Di&s;po&s;ition for opening the Campaign, or at lea&s;t for oppo&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> Armies, who gene|rally made their fir&s;t and greate&s;t Effort in the &s;econd or third, or at lea&s;t the fourth Moons before the <HI>Germans</HI> could be gotten in the Field.</P>
<P>But it was needful for him to go back to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Councils of War, and to
<PB N="116" REF="136">
concert there more effectually the Operations of the War. He was arrived within a few Leagues of the Emperor's Court, namely at a Village called <HI>Wells</HI> near <HI>Lintz,</HI> on the <HI>Danube;</HI> when his Cold encrea&s;ing he found a Swelling in his Throat, which grew &s;o much as to impo&s;tumate, and turn to what their Phy&s;ici|ans here call a <HI>Quinzy,</HI> and this came on him with &s;uch Violence, that notwith&s;tanding the Place was inconvenient, and not capable of entertaining him, he was obliged to &s;top, not being able to &s;tir a Step farther: In a Word, in that ob&s;cure Village he fini&s;h'd the Cour&s;e of what vain Men here call a Life of Glory and Victory; that is, in plain Truth, a Life of Blood and of the de&s;troying his Fellow-Creatures; for as War is the Plague of Hea|ven, ca&s;t upon Men by the Di&s;plea&s;ure of God; The&s;e we fooli&s;hly call Heroes, what are they but bloody Men? commanded by the irrevo|cable Decree to fulfil what in Wrath has been prede&s;tinated to be inflicted upon the Nati|ons of the Earth.</P>
<P>But to return to the Duke; he found his End draw on apace, and herein he &s;hewed more of the Hero than in the greate&s;t Victories he gain'd; for 'tis allowed on all Hands, that he received the fir&s;t Summons of Death with a Steadine&s;s of Mind equal to tho&s;e <HI>Romans</HI> of old, who e&s;teemed Death no other than a &s;haking Hands with the Gods. In a Word, glorious Prince, this Duke wanted nothing in Life or in Death, but to have been numbred among the Faithful, to have been a true Be|liever in the everla&s;ting Law, and a Servant to the Grand Seignior.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="137">
He met Death with an undaunted Heart, and tho' the Di&s;temper was &s;o violent as to al|low him very little Intervals from the Convul|&s;ions of Death, and but a very few Moments of time, having &s;eized upon the Pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and deprived him of the U&s;e even of his Lungs, except with violent Heavings and in&s;upportable Pangs for Breath, yet he applyed him&s;elf immediately to the Point of dying with an unu&s;ual Alacrity. He fir&s;t &s;ent for a Prie&s;t or Dervice, whom they call here a Confe&s;&s;or; for to &s;uch the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> apply in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and disburthening their Con&s;ci|ences, as they call it, confe&s;s to them all their Sins, and then think the&s;e poor Creatures, wicked like them&s;elves, can ab&s;olve and for|give them; fooli&s;h Notion! as if any but God, again&s;t whom our Offences are committed, could wipe out that Account, which Souls mu&s;t give to their Maker, which if true, then had tho&s;e wicked Creatures Power to licen&s;e the committing all manner of Crimes.</P>
<P>When his Confe&s;&s;or came, as above, he found him &s;ilent; for his Speech was &s;topt by the Bulk of the Impo&s;tumation, &s;o he took a Pen and Ink, and wrote his Confe&s;&s;ion which he intended to make, which the &s;aid Prie&s;t read aloud to him in private, and then put into the Fire in his Pre&s;ence; for 'tis their Maxim, that what is delivered in Confe&s;&s;ion is &s;acred, and never to be divulged; nay, &s;ome have gone the Length as to &s;ay, that if a Man, in Confe&s;|&s;ion, declar'd he intended to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his Prince, the Prie&s;t mu&s;t not divulge it, no, tho' doing &s;o would &s;ave the Life of the Per&s;on: For which devili&s;h Doctrine one whole Soci|ety, of the&s;e Dervices, called Je&s;uits, were ex|pell'd

<P>The Duke having fini&s;hed his Confe&s;&s;ion, he, in the next Place, received the chymerick Ab|&s;olution, I have ju&s;t now mentioned, from the Hands of his Prie&s;t, together with the Via|ticum, or the Sacrament, <HI>as they call it,</HI> of ex|treme Unction, which, in a Word, they call here the la&s;t Office of the Church, and making Peace with God. This being over, and per|ceiving his End ha&s;tily approaching, he wrote a Letter to the Emperor, wherein, after he had te&s;tify'd his Sorrow for being no longer able to &s;erve him, he recommended his Wife and all his Family to his imperial Care. He wrote another to the Prince&s;s his Lady, to comfort her for her Lo&s;s; which two Letters he gave to his Confe&s;&s;or, with Orders to deliver 'em immediately after his Death: After which the Impo&s;thume that was in his Throat bur&s;ting within Side, &s;tifled him; &s;o that he expired in the Arms of his Confe&s;&s;or the 18<HI>th</HI> of the 4<HI>th</HI> Moon in the Evening.</P>

<P>'Tis not yet known who will be declared Generali&s;&s;imo of the Emperor's Forces; but the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> will return into <HI>Hungary,</HI> to command the Imperiali&s;ts, unle&s;s his pre|&s;ent Sickne&s;s hinders him.</P>
<P>Every Body that con&s;iders the Con&s;equences of this Duke's Death, mu&s;t acknowledge that the Emperor had better have lo&s;t Ten Thou|&s;and Men, for how great a General &s;oever he may have &s;till remaining on that Side, it may be &s;aid there is not one that has that Expert|ne&s;s, that Experience, that Authority, that Credit and Love of the Soldiers, which the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had, in&s;omuch that all the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> willingly gave way to him; and in Regard he was a Prince poor and di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed, there was no Body jealous of him; but they were &s;till glad of the good Succe&s;s which generally attended his Arms; whereas, on whomever el&s;e the Emperor ca&s;t his Eyes, to confer upon him the Command of his Armies, he cannot &s;o well order it, but that it mu&s;t breed Jealou&s;ies among &s;everal of the Princes, and the greate&s;t Part of the re&s;t of the Generals; there is not any one that has Authority &s;uffici|ent to make him&s;elf equally obey'd by &s;o ma|ny different Nations as compo&s;e the imperial Army, and who have every one their Chieftain, that pretends to be independant, and not ob|liged to receive Orders from any one whatever.</P>

<P>THOU who ha&s;t been deliver'd from the Burthens of the apo&s;tate Nation, mu&s;t needs be al&s;o filled with ju&s;t Indignation at the Super&s;titions and Here&s;ies of thy People, from who&s;e Tabernacles thou ha&s;t taken thy Flight.

<P>Prithee tell me, enlighten'd <HI>Morat,</HI> what hodge podge of a Con&s;titution will the <HI>Jews</HI> bring their Religion to at la&s;t? they have already blended the Explanations and Expo&s;iti|ons of Men in &s;uch a gro&s;s manner, with the po&s;itive Law of God, that it is hard for any that have not critically &s;tudied the Con&s;tituti|ons of the Mount, to know one from the o|ther.</P>
<P>I have read over very attentively the Penta|teuch, or Books wherein the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is contained; and mu&s;t tell thee, had the <HI>Jews</HI> ad|hered &s;tedfa&s;tly to the Letter of that Law, and not mixed with it their &s;everal Innovations, which they would have call'd by the Name of Interpretations, they had certainly been the Peo|ple of God to this Day; or until the <HI>Shiloth</HI> of old Father <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had come; and whether he
<PB N="122" REF="142">

<P>But be the Me&s;&s;iah, who is doubtle&s;s meant there by <HI>Shiloh,</HI> and in other Places of their Prophet, called by other Names, come or not come, about which I purpo&s;e to write to thee hereafter; it is mo&s;t certain that the <HI>Jews</HI> have, in a mo&s;t egregious Manner, prophaned and corrupted the fir&s;t In&s;titution of their Law; and there is no Wonder that when the Prophet of the Chri&s;tians, Je&s;us the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> came among them, this was the great thing for which he reproached them, and charged their Scribes and Phari&s;ees with Hypocri&s;ie: It is certain that it was for this that they were implacably bent to de&s;troy him, and that they abhor his Name and Memory to this Day; But al&s;o 'tis mo&s;t certain that they were convinc'd that he had too much Rea&s;on, on his Side, to be op|po&s;ed; that they really had taught for Do|ctrines the Commandments of Men, and had de|&s;troyed the Law, by mixing with it their cor|rupt Traditions and Sayings of the Elders.</P>
<P>Had not the <HI>Jews</HI> thus degenerated from the fir&s;t In&s;titutions of God's Law, exhibited by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> doubtle&s;s <HI>Mahomet</HI> and all the Empire of the faithful Mu&s;&s;ulmen, had been <HI>Jews</HI> to this Day.

<P>But this Degeneracy of the <HI>Jews</HI> encrea&s;ing, and be&s;ides having led them, as Delu&s;ions naturally do, to all manner of Neglect of the Commands of God, has given Ri&s;e to all the Variety of Abominations which have appear'd among that profligate People to this Day.</P>
<P>Hence the Doctrine of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> and hence the pure Rules of our glorious <HI>Mahomet,</HI> have taken the Ri&s;e of their Epocha in the World; for were we to &s;uppo&s;e them, or either of them, not to be of divine In&s;titution, Heaven forbid &s;uch Prophanene&s;s! yet it might very rea&s;onably be expected, that when the People of the Nations round them &s;aw the Laws of God thus confounded with the Devices of Men; and the People, by con&s;equence, deviated into all manner of Wickedne&s;s, they would rightly conclude, that either the Law was ful|fill'd, and the divine In&s;titution terminated, and &s;o they ought to &s;eek out the Ways of Truth as Heaven &s;hould direct them; or that &s;ome terrible Judgment from Heaven would attend the People who had &s;o degenerated, that they would be removed from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Face of the Earth, and &s;ome new and gloriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">evelation would be given of the further Mind of God, the great Legi&s;lator of the World.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e Events are certainly come to pa&s;s, and the <HI>Jews</HI> are manife&s;tly ca&s;t out of the Fold, as wicked and corrupted Creatures, dege|nerated Plants; having forfeited the Care of him who fir&s;t watered and cultivated them, who they have voluntarily rejected and de|&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="144">
Happy be thy Days, enlighten'd Convert, who art broken loo&s;e from the Bondage of Hypocrites, and ha&s;t detected the Fraud of electing an Oral Law in the Throne of the di|vine Revelation.

<P>For know thou that the Succe&s;&s;ors of our great Prophet, <HI>(viz)</HI> the Saracenical Caliphs, were the Men, who, in the Name of God, drove the Rabbinical Impo&s;tors from <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Seat of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Innovations, where the Talmud and the Collections of their Innovations and Errors were fir&s;t made, and from whence the <HI>Gemara,</HI> or great Ma&s;s of Traditions, being a Comment upon the more ancient Mi&s;na, which they would have called the Oral Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> obtained the Name of <HI>Babylonian.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay the <HI>Arabian</HI> Caliphs and <HI>Saracen</HI> Powers, the immediate Succe&s;&s;ors of our great Prophet, &s;cattered the&s;e collected Mi&s;chiefs; and the Blow given to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Impo&s;tures has never yet been recovered, or ever will be while the World endures; for God, the Author of Truth, abhors the Mixtures of humane Tra|ditions with his divine In&s;titutions, much more when they are injuriou&s;ly placed in a wicked U&s;urpation over his own Laws.</P>
<P>From this Conque&s;t of <HI>Babylon</HI> by <HI>Abu Obeid</HI> the great Captain of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> may reckon the Epocha of their more effectual De&s;olation, and of their being &s;cattered over the whole World; in which di&s;pers'd Condition, as it of|ten happens, they have neither pre&s;erv'd the Law, no, nor the Talmud it &s;elf, from farther

<P>THOU knowe&s;t little of the Scituation of Affairs on this Side of the World, and le&s;s of my Circum&s;tances in this Place, that thou ha&s;t written to me to furni&s;h thee with Materials for thy learned Enquiry into the Antiquities of the Ea&s;t, and &s;upply thee with Particulars for the Hi&s;tory of the Empire of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> which I under&s;tand thou art compiling.</P>
<P>Had&s;t thou written to me to &s;upply thee with the nice&s;t and mo&s;t particular Accounts of the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> Empires, this is the fitte&s;t Place, at this Time, in the World for &s;uch an Enquiry; the Learning of this Age ap|plying them&s;elves, and that with a great and ju&s;t Applau&s;e, to tho&s;e Studies, to which al&s;o they find great A&s;&s;i&s;tance among tho&s;e Writers which they call the Cla&s;&s;icks.</P>
<P>But for the Ea&s;tern Learning, tho' it is it &s;elf the Beauty of all Study, and would furni&s;h mat|ter for innumerable Hi&s;tories, of the greate&s;t Actions in the World; much greater than fur|ni&s;hed the Song of <HI>Homer,</HI> or the Commenta|ries of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar;</HI> yet it is in it &s;elf &s;o re|mote, that the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue, in which all tho&s;e things are to be found, is &s;o &s;unk out of Knowledge, in the&s;e Parts of the World; and the getting the Tracts that are extant in it, is &s;o exceeding difficult, that indeed the En|quiry after it is as good as dropt, and Men

are backward to enter into a Study, which &s;eems lock'd up from humane Enquiries, or at lea&s;t fortified with &s;o many Retreats and inacce&s;&s;ible Darkne&s;&s;es, that it is &s;carce to be attempted.</P>
<P>As the Wars of the <HI>Arabians</HI> are a Story fill|ed with infinite Variety, and that Nation had been for many Ages the brave&s;t, the mo&s;t a&s;|piring to, and the be&s;t fitted for glorious Actions, of any People in the World; &s;o Arts and Sciences, and all &s;orts of Learning, flouri&s;hed in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Kingdoms, even before the re&s;t of the World had either learn|ed the Methods of In&s;truction, or had any Sen&s;e of the Ble&s;&s;ing of it.</P>
<P>Acquired Knowledge &s;eems to have had its fir&s;t Ri&s;e in that Country, the Climate, favour|ed by Heaven with all that could make a Country plea&s;ant and agreeable, de&s;ervedly gained for the Country the Title of <HI>Felix.</HI> The Inhabitants breathed an Air that a&s;&s;i&s;ted Nature beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, in forming a Peo|ple for great things; perfect Health, invigorating Juices in the Fruits of the Earth, and innume|rable Helps from natural Cau&s;es, prepared the People for the generous Principles, the Forti|tude, and the Gallantry of true Heroes; they &s;eem'd fit to undertake things more than hu|mane, and yet appeared capable of every thing they undertook.</P>
<P>In Study they outdid Nature; they &s;earched into her very Bowels, and di&s;clo&s;ed her mo&s;t concealed Parts; they ma&s;ter'd all kinds of A&s;tronomical, Mathematical, Anatomical, and A&s;trological Knowledge; Wi&s;dom &s;eemed to be born of them, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Accompli&s;hments of the Soul became com|mon and familiar; as if it had been the natural

Genius of the Country: As they had in their Temper the greate&s;t Application to Learning, &s;o they had in their Minds the greate&s;t Capa|cities to attain it: They had the brighte&s;t Parts, the cleare&s;t Heads, and the devoute&s;t Hearts of any Nation in the World.</P>
<P>In their common Conduct, they had the Beauties of Behaviour, and the mo&s;t correct Attachment to every moral Virtue; and be|&s;ides all this they had joined to the height of a martial Genius, the &s;ofte&s;t, meeke&s;t Di&s;po|&s;itions in the World; as they were in the Field, all Fire; &s;o they were in the Family, all Phlegm; a manly Humility &s;hone in the Characters of their greate&s;t Caliphs, and a ge|nerous Clemency was the very natural Pro|duce of the highe&s;t Birth.</P>
<P>From them the World learned Knowledge, all liberal Arts, all Studies of Science began with them; they were the Men who gave Names to the Stars, di&s;cover'd the Motions of the heavenly Bodies, and which is yet a more &s;ublime Study, found out the Influences of the planetary World, and how the heavenly Bo|dies govern this Globe, and reign in all the particular Cla&s;&s;es of vegetative, &s;en&s;itive, and rational Life.</P>
<P>From them the <HI>Ptolomaian</HI> A&s;tronomers ga|thered the fir&s;t Rudiments of their great Sy|&s;tem of Cele&s;tial Motions; from them the <HI>Ae&s;culapian</HI> deriv'd the Fundamentals of Phy|&s;ical and Anatomical Knowledge</P>
<P><HI>Job,</HI> if the <HI>Jews</HI> have pre&s;erved an authen|tick Account of that eminent <HI>Arabian;</HI> and the Book called by his Name, which was found in the Archives of the Sons of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> may be de|pended upon, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the Students in

A&s;tronomy, in Phy&s;icks or Metaphy&s;icks, which have &s;ince his Time been &s;een in the World.</P>
<P>Even the <HI>Jews</HI> them&s;elves, the Rabbins and the greate&s;t Men among them, had but little Knowledge in any other &s;ort of Science than the meer Study of their own Law, and the Di&s;qui&s;itions of nece&s;&s;ary things relating to their Sanhedrim and Court of Ju&s;tice; till they came to conver&s;e with the learned <HI>Arabians:</HI> From them they received the fir&s;t Intro|ductions in Science, and the Love of the mo&s;t excellent Parts of Knowledge, &s;uch as the Study of Philo&s;ophy, the Mathematicks, and e&s;pecially the Study of Nature.</P>
<P>It is true, there is a great Variety of cri|tical Study among tho&s;e Rabbins, and they di&s;covered them&s;elves to have among them Men of bright Parts, a&s;piring Thoughts, and clear and exqui&s;ite Judgments; but, as above, it was wholly taken up in the Study of their own Law, &s;olving Difficulties in the Interpre|tation of their particular Ca&s;es of Judicature, and &s;ettling Points of Con&s;cience in the Con|formity to Ceremonial In&s;titutions</P>
<P>But even <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf, when any thing is &s;po|ken of his Learning, it &s;peaks of it as borrowed. He <HI>was learned in all the Wi&s;dom of the Aegyptians,</HI> and this Wi&s;dom or Learning of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> was al&s;o received from the <HI>Arabians,</HI> with whom the mo&s;t ancient Knowledge of the Sciences is to be found.</P>
<P>Search then, <HI>my Friend,</HI> the ancient Libraries, the Monuments and Records of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> if thou woulde&s;t learn any thing of the Ea&s;t|ern Antiquity; with them, even long before the coming of our Prophet, was trea&s;ur'd up an infinite Variety of humane Wi&s;dom and Knowledge; and &s;ince the Time of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="150">
under the Caliphs and Princes of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> the polite&s;t Learning of tho&s;e Days has flou|ri&s;hed in their Dominions; their more anci|ent Conque&s;ts &s;pread the glorious Light of heavenly Wi&s;dom over the Ea&s;tern World, and they afterwards brought the Rudiments of Philo&s;ophy into the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Countries.</P>
<P>Among them were found the innumerable Tracts of Hi&s;tory, and all kinds of Learning which compleated <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s Library, in which it is &s;aid were to be found Seventy Thou|&s;and Volumes, and from tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts innumerable Copies were handed continually forward into other Parts of the World, till that glorious Collection was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> afterward, the &s;ame Spirit of Magnanimity and Glory was pre&s;er|ved, with the &s;ame Love of Litterature, and the &s;ame Genius for Art and Sciences, during the fortunate Government of the <HI>Mamalukes,</HI> till they, with the whole Ea&s;tern World, &s;unk under the invincible Arm of <HI>Sultan Selym,</HI> who God appointed to be Lord of the whole Earth.</P>
<P>Here then apply thy &s;elf for Materials for thy well de&s;igned Collection.

<HEAD>LETTER V. To the Kadileskar of <HI>Natolia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is very &s;eldom that I propo&s;e any of the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> for an Example to the true Be|lievers, becau&s;e they are here the greate&s;t Hy|pocrites in the World; Religion is made a meer Gui&s;e of Deceit, and the Out&s;ide they put on to appear devout, has ever &s;ome holy Cheat in it to draw in Fools, or to buoy up the Spirits of the Commons, to &s;upport with more Alacrity the heavy Loads they are to lay upon them. It is a proverbial Saying of their own,
<Q><P>When the Fox preaches, <HI>Guardez les Poules,</HI> beware of the Guee&s;e.</P></Q></P>
<P>However, as an Example of a Hypocrite may be recommended; becau&s;e the Out&s;ide of it is guilded over with the Sanctity of an An|gel, and the vile De&s;ign with which it is per|formed is concealed; &s;o I recommend to the Faithful the Practice of Religion, without the Hypocri&s;ie; the Gui&s;e, without the Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Paris</HI> are every thing the King plea&s;es; and tho' in them&s;elves, and fol|lowing the Dictates of their own Inclinati|on, they are the gaye&s;t, profu&s;e, and mo&s;t debauch'd People alive; yet all on a &s;udden a Fit of Religion having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them, they are all turned Phari&s;ees and Reclu&s;es.</P>
<P>The Alteration has &s;omething di&s;mal in it; for in&s;tead of an Air of inexpre&s;&s;ible Levity,

<P>The Publick-Hou&s;es, Cabarets, or Taverns, look as if they were broke; the Opera's, the Mu&s;ick-Meetings, and the Gaming-Ordinaries, are &s;hut up; nothing open but the Churches: The fine Walks and Gardens at the King's

<P>And what's the Matter all this while? Is it real Devotion? Is the Humour of the Nation changed? Are the People really become religi|ous? nothing like it!

<P>It is true, this is all grimace; nor do the wi&s;er &s;ort pretend to talk much of that kind; but they &s;ay, the la&s;t Year having been a Year of Glory and Succe&s;s to the King, tho' &s;urrounded with infinite Enemies, it has all been procur'd by the exemplary Devotion

<HEAD>LETTER VI. To <HI>Morat Hu&s;ain Abdeilomar,</HI> Cai|macham of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT belongs to thee, happy <HI>Morat,</HI> that keepe&s;t the Gates of the illu&s;trious Port, the City of Joy, within who&s;e Walls dwells the mighty, the re&s;plendent Mirror of Glory, the King of Emperors, who&s;e Days be multiplied, and his Felicity endle&s;s; it belongs to thee, I &s;ay, to hear how the great Cities of the World behave, when the pro&s;perous Arms of their Princes bring Triumph to their Gates.</P>
<P>Contrary to the Expectation of Enemies; nay, even to the Surprize of the Court it &s;elf, every Patt of the <HI>French</HI> Frontiers has furni&s;hed &s;ome Subject of Triumph to the King of <HI>France,</HI> this pa&s;t Year; they have been over|whelmed with Joy, on all Sides, which is in|deed the more welcome, becau&s;e they were not without Apprehen&s;ions of the Superiority of their Enemies almo&s;t on all Sides.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the Year &s;aluted them with a compleat Victory at <HI>Fleuri,</HI> on the Banks of the <HI>Sambre,</HI> the Month of <HI>June</HI> with a Victory at Sea: The <HI>French</HI> Navy, the mo&s;t formidable that ever one &s;ingle Power could boa&s;t of &s;ince the U&s;e of Ships of War was known, attack'd and defeated the united Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and burnt, &s;trand|ed, and took Seven Men of War, from 70 to 90 Guns each, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>England:</HI> After this they landed &s;ome Men on the &s;ame
<PB N="140" REF="160">
Coa&s;t, and burnt and plundered &s;everal Vil|lages. In <HI>Italy,</HI> where it was thought the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had been &s;o well &s;upported by his Allies, that he would have been &s;uperior to the <HI>French;</HI> he has been attack'd by the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Catinat,</HI> an old and experienc'd General, and in a great Battle overthrown, near <HI>Sallu&s;&s;es</HI> in <HI>Piemont;</HI> 4000 of his Men &s;lain, 1000 Pri&s;oners; with all his Cannon, Baggage, and Colours taken, and the Duke him&s;elf nar|rowly e&s;caping.</P>
<P>This Battle has been &s;o important, tho' the Action it &s;elf was not great, that the Court are not able to conceal their Joy; and the King him&s;elf was heard to &s;ay, he valued it more than the two other Victories of the Year, <HI>(viz)</HI> that of <HI>Fleuri,</HI> and that at Sea.</P>
<P>And he has Rea&s;on to do &s;o; for as the War in <HI>Savoy</HI> was more expen&s;ive to the King, being at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, and carried on with more Re&s;entment on either Side; &s;o the King was infinitely more de&s;irous to bring it to a Conclu&s;ion, that he might turn his Arms another way more to his Advantage; and which was greater &s;till, the King had more to fear, on that Side, than on any other, if his Enemies &s;hould get the Advantage of his Troops.</P>
<P>But he has now effectually &s;ecur'd his Do|minions on that Side, and his Army continues to ravage the Country, to deprive the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting his Army; they have al&s;o taken <HI>Saluzzes, Savigliane,</HI> and &s;everal o|ther important Po&s;ts from the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as the Con&s;equences of that Victory; and in Clo&s;e of the Year all the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> ex|cept the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Montmellian,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Suza,</HI> fell into the Hands of the <HI>French;</HI> &s;o
<PB N="141" REF="161">
that unle&s;s the Emperor &s;upports the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> with a very &s;trong Power, he will be reduced to very narrow Circum&s;tances in a little Time.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the Confederates boa&s;ted of great Attempts to be made of breaking into the Heart of <HI>France,</HI> and the like; particular|ly it was &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who com|mands the Army &s;ince the Death of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> would bring an Hundred Thou&s;and Men into the Field; but the <HI>Dauphine,</HI> who&s;e Army was never above 45000 Men, has de|fended the Frontiers, and, in his Turn, pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted his Army in the Plains of <HI>Stollhoffen,</HI> at the Expence of the Ene|mies, and yet has drawn off without fighting, which is in it &s;elf a Victory.</P>
<P>Thus all things concur to make the King of <HI>France</HI> triumph over his Enemies, and he lives in the continual Clamour of Joy, the Guns are ever firing for the good News which comes in from one Quarter or another, and I &s;it in my little Retreat, and laugh at the Madne&s;s of the&s;e Infidels, who thus weaken and de&s;troy one another, leaving thereby an open Door of Victory to the Arms of the Grand Seignior, who&s;e Ways be pro&s;perous, and his Triumphs uninterrupted</P>
<P>Fortunate <HI>Morat,</HI> let no Opportunity &s;lip to pu&s;h the Intere&s;t of the illu&s;trious high Port, and fail not to take all the ju&s;t Advantages that the Di&s;&s;entions of the Powers of the <HI>Na|zarcens</HI> offer to thee; the&s;e are the Times ap|pointed, by Fate, for the Recovery of all the Territories of the Grand Seignior, lo&s;t by the unhappy Conduct of the Vizier <HI>Azem,</HI> when he made that fatal Attempt again&s;t <HI>Vienna,</HI> when <HI>Mahomet</HI> was di&s;plea&s;ed, and God was
<PB N="142" REF="162">
angry, and the Faithful turned their Backs, and fled from the Face of their Enemies.</P>
<P>At the latter End of the Moon <HI>Rebliah</HI> the &s;econd, called here <HI>April,</HI> the Death of the <HI>Dauphine&s;s,</HI> Wife to the elde&s;t Son of the King of <HI>France,</HI> died; which having thrown the whole Court into Black, le&s;&s;en'd much of the Lu&s;tre which would have been &s;een here on the Occa&s;ions of the Victories I have menti|oned: But their Joy is not the le&s;s for their mourning Out&s;ides; &s;eeing this is a Nation that is not more eminent for any thing in the World, than for &s;eeming what they are not, and being what they do not &s;eem.</P>
<P>Well be it with the true Believers, who tri|umph in a Rectitude of Soul, and always are bold to &s;hew the Affection or Enmity, which they entertain in their Brea&s;t, whether it be Per&s;onal or National; Di&s;&s;imulation is the Ef|fect of a Cowardice and Ba&s;ene&s;s of the Mind, which renders it afraid to &s;hew the In&s;ide of the Heart: God, who abhors Hypocri&s;ie, can never be &s;uppo&s;ed, without bla&s;phemous Con|ceptions of his Nature, to approve the&s;e <HI>Naza|reens;</HI> for Sincerity dwells not in them.</P>
<P>May the Gates of Paradi&s;e &s;tand open to thee, and the Angel of the Vale receive thee with open Arms, ready to tran&s;port thee to the Mount of Joy, and open to thee the My|&s;teries of inconceivable Plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. To the Rutalier Aga, chief Eunuch, or Chief of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THEY are greatly mi&s;taken, who think the Affairs of the Port have not their Influence on the&s;e Parts of the World where I dwell; they who plac'd me here, who are now &s;hining in the Garden of Beauty, had other Notions, or they would not have obli|ged me to re&s;ide here &s;o many Years.</P>
<P>The happy Succe&s;&s;es of the Grand Vizier in <HI>Hungary,</HI> thereby opening a Way for farther Conque&s;ts to the Arms of the victorious <HI>Otto|mans,</HI> is acknowledg'd here to be the &s;aving the King of <HI>France</HI> from the ab&s;olute Ruine which the Superiority of the <HI>Germans,</HI> and their Con|federates, would have infallibly brought upon them; and I infer from hence, that whenever the perfect Wi&s;dom of our mighty Emperor &s;hall think fit to put an End to the Conque&s;ts he is making in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and con&s;ent to come to a Truce with the&s;e Infidels, there is no Que&s;tion but all the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> who are now in Confederacy again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> will put their helping Hand to &s;uch a Work; and will join together their Endeavours, to bring the Emperor of the <HI>Nazareens</HI> to yield to all the Demands of the Port, that they may be at lei&s;ure to turn all their united Armies again&s;t this more dangerous Enemy, the King of <HI>France;</HI> who is now e&s;teemed among them
<PB N="144" REF="164">
as the common Enemy, of what they call, Chri|&s;tendom.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Language of the Infidels here is, that the Mu&s;&s;ulmen have once again gotten Fortune on their Side, and perhaps, <HI>&s;ays one of their Authors here,</HI> may have found out the Secret to chain her &s;o fa&s;t to their Vizier's Tent, that &s;he &s;hall not make her E&s;cape a &s;econd Time.</P>
<P>I write the&s;e things, to hint that ancient Maxim of <HI>Caled</HI> the great, the fir&s;t General, to <HI>Abbubeker, Caliph,</HI> and immediate Succe&s;&s;or to <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the Civil and Military Government; I hint to thee his Maxim, I &s;ay, <HI>(viz) That a Time of Victory is the Time to make Peace:</HI> The Rea|&s;on is clear; <HI>for then,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you are &s;ure to keep what you have gain'd, and obtain what you ask.</HI></P>
<P>They talk here that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters at the Port, have Orders to con|cern them&s;elves, in the Names of their Ma|&s;ters, to encline the Grand Seignior to Thoughts of Peace; and offer to act as Me|diators. This is a Signal in deed, <HI>if true,</HI> of the weak Condition of the Emperor's Affairs; 'tis no le&s;s than a white Flag hung out of a Town be&s;ieged, to offer a Capitulation and &s;urrender. And I doubt not the Vizier will know how to make his Advantage of it.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>France</HI> regarding her own In|tere&s;t, will oppo&s;e it with all her Might, knowing that if the <HI>Nazareen</HI> Emperor con|cludes a Peace with the Port, he will make no Peace with him. But if I might be per|mitted to give my Judgment in &s;o weighty a Ca&s;e, it is, that the Port &s;hould weight her own Strength and Intere&s;t, not forgetting to note, that however the Port may regard <HI>France</HI> in carrying on the War, <HI>France</HI> would
<PB N="145" REF="165">
have no Regard to the Intere&s;t of the Grand Seignior, if he was de&s;igning to clap up the War by a Peace; but would rather a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor again&s;t the Mu&s;&s;ulmen, as they did at the Battle of <HI>Raab,</HI> and as they did in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Venetians</HI> at the Siege of <HI>Candia;</HI> things which the illu&s;trious Port may happen to re|member to them hereafter.</P>
<P>Yeild to Peace then while Victory crowns thy Attempts, O Man a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Heaven, and let an End be put to &s;hedding the Blood of the Faithful.</P>
<P>Not that I fear for the Grand Vizier; tho' they talk here loudly of the mighty Strength of the <HI>Nazareen</HI> Emperor, and that he will have an Hundred Thou&s;and di&s;ciplin'd Soldiers on Foot in <HI>Hungary</HI> this approaching Campaign; but it cannot be rational to be|lieve it: If I may credit the vulgar Opi|nion in this Place, Money is more difficult to be had in <HI>Germany</HI> than Men, and the Empe|ror will be very &s;orely di&s;tre&s;s'd to rai&s;e Mo|ney for this double War, if it holds another Campaign.</P>
<P>His hereditary Dominions are terribly ex|hau&s;ted; the Contingencies, or Quota's of the Princes of the Empire, which they call the <HI>Roman</HI> Months, come in, not only &s;lowly, but even not at all; the &s;maller Princes only are tho&s;e that pay any thing, and the great ones nothing. The fir&s;t plead Poverty, and the la&s;t Power, giving trifling Rea&s;ons and haughty An&s;wers, without paying any Part of their Money to the military Che&s;t, or &s;ending their Quota's of Men to the Army.</P>
<P>Mighty Princes often think fit to put Bounds to their Conque&s;ts, even when they have Power to extend them farther: It is
<PB N="146" REF="166">
&s;ufficient that the Vizier has recovered to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire the Banks of the <HI>Sauve,</HI> and of the <HI>Thei&s;s,</HI> and that <HI>Belgrade</HI> and <HI>Teme&s;waer</HI> remain the invincible Barriers of our Empire. As for the re&s;t of <HI>Hungary,</HI> it will be more an Expence than an Advantage to the <HI>Nazareens</HI> to keep it: The <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who hate the <HI>Germans,</HI> being all Malecontents, as well upon Religious as Political Accounts, will be for ever rai&s;ing Commotions, weakening the Power, and exhau&s;ting the Trea&s;ure of the Emperor, till at length wa&s;ted by continual Factions, that Kingdom will fall naturally in|to the Hands of the ju&s;t Nation, without fighting, as it did before.</P>
<P>Pro&s;perous be the Days of the Emperor of the Ju&s;t, may his Head re&s;plendent with Ce|le&s;tial Glory &s;hine like the Stars, and his Crown be a Con&s;tellation of Five Hundred Suns. Joy be to thy exalted Soul, dear <HI>Ach|methies,</HI> both here and in Paradi&s;e. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. To the Kaimacham.</HEAD>
<P>I Have often given the Characters of the illu&s;trious Men of the&s;e Parts of the World; and have told thee, that the King of <HI>France</HI> has the greate&s;t and be&s;t Generals of the Age, and it is mo&s;t true, the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> in
<PB N="147" REF="167">
<HI>Flanders,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Catinat,</HI> who acts again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> are certainly two of the greate&s;t Men this Age affords, and Victory &s;eems to attend every Action they take in Hand.</P>
<P>But I am called off from &s;uch mean Chara|cters, if after what I have &s;aid of them they may be called mean, I &s;ay, I am called off from them to the ri&s;ing Figure the new King of <HI>England</HI> makes in the World.</P>
<P>I have often nam'd this Per&s;on to thee as <HI>Prince of Orange;</HI> but being now &s;tept up into the Chair of Maje&s;ty, and mounted the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or rather <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, his Power having thus encrea|&s;ed to an Equality with his martial Genius, which indeed it was not before, he begins to threaten <HI>France</HI> with &s;uch an Appearance in the Field, as no Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> ever made before him.</P>
<P>He has been in <HI>Ireland</HI> in Per&s;on, where he pa&s;s'd a great River called the <HI>Boyn,</HI> in the Face of a &s;uperior Army of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and defeated them by plain fighting; the Slaughter was not great, but the Victory plain and confe&s;s'd by the Flight of that unfortunate Prince, the Depo&s;ed King, the 2d. time to <HI>France,</HI> who arrived here the latter End of the la&s;t Year.</P>
<P>The victorious Prince pur&s;uing the Cour&s;e of his good Fortune, has recover'd the mo&s;t Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and leaving the re&s;t to his Generals, appears now at the <HI>Hague,</HI> forming Alliances again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> and his De&s;igns &s;eem to threaten the King of <HI>France,</HI> that he will arm all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> again&s;t him.</P>
<P>It is incredible to hear how the Princes and States, on all Sides, care&s;s him; the Congre&s;s which he has formed at the <HI>Hague,</HI> is what was
<PB N="148" REF="168">
never &s;een in tho&s;e Parts of the World. He makes him&s;elf be adored by all the Powers of that Part of the World; and tho' they di&s;&s;em|ble their Apprehen&s;ions, he is terribly feared by this Part.</P>
<P>The haughty Spirit of the King indeed, who knows not how to fear God or Man, &s;upports the <HI>French</HI> Nation; and their natural Aptne&s;s to blu&s;ter, makes them &s;eemingly de|&s;pi&s;e this Prince; but it is ea&s;ie to &s;ee the Con&s;ternation of their more re&s;erv'd Thoughts. They prepare for the War as if it was to be carried on after a differing Manner than it u&s;es to be; and in <HI>Flanders</HI> particularly, as if they were to be more &s;eriou&s;ly attack'd there than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>They pick and cull their whole Army for the be&s;t Troops, and the mo&s;t active and enter|pri&s;ing Generals; they new mount their Ca|valry, and do a Thou&s;and things to encourage the Officers to behave well; at the &s;ame time letting them know they are to expect hot Work; that they mu&s;t look for Blows; and that nothing but &s;uperior Numbers, and &s;upe|rior Courage, will carry on the War on that Side.</P>
<P>As for the King of <HI>England,</HI> he is now at the <HI>Hague,</HI> where, as I have &s;aid, he has form'd a Congre&s;s of the Princes of the Northern Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> who are arrived there in &s;uch Num|bers, either in Per&s;on, or by their Amba&s;&s;adors, that it is worthy thy Remark, the like not having happen'd in any Age; where they con|cert a League or Alliance offen&s;ive, as they call it, of all their Powers again&s;t the &s;ingle Power of <HI>France.</HI> If this King of <HI>France</HI> can with&s;tand this Confederacy, <HI>Europe</HI> mu&s;t be re|duced under his Hand into one univer&s;al Mo|narchy
<PB N="149" REF="169">
or Empire, far exceeding that of <HI>Char|lemaign.</HI></P>
<P>It may be of u&s;e to thee, and for the Ser|vice of our glorious Emperor the Grand Seig|nior, to give thee &s;ome Account of this Con|gre&s;s: There was a&s;&s;embled be&s;ides the King and Fourteen Noblemen of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> who he brought over with him, for the Splendor of his new gained Dominions; and be&s;ides the two Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> Five and Twenty Soveraign Princes, having E&s;tates and Dominions of their own; &s;uch as the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick Lunenburgh,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxe Ey&s;uach,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Courland,</HI> and others of like Degree; Four|teen Princes of great Hou&s;es, but not them|&s;elves Soveraigns; 37 Generals, all of them having Titles of Honour, be&s;ides their mili|tary Character; the <HI>Dutch</HI> high Admiral <HI>Trump;</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Governor of the <HI>Spani&s;h Ne|therlands, (viz.)</HI> the Marquis <HI>de Ga&s;tanaga,</HI> and the imperial General the Prince <HI>de Commercy.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were a prodigious Train of Amba&s;&s;adors, Envoys Extraordinary, and pub|lick Mini&s;ters from other Princes, States, and Powers; &s;uch as were too great or too remote to appear in Per&s;on, and even from &s;ome that were pre&s;ent, who were to remain when their Principals were gone. The Account they give here of them is thus.</P>
<P>Three from the Emperor, Two from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> One from <HI>Sweden,</HI> Two from <HI>Denmark,</HI> Two from <HI>Savoy;</HI> from the Electors of <HI>Bavaria, Brandenburgh, Treves, Mentz,</HI> and <HI>Cologn,</HI> each Two; from the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> one; from the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> one; from the King and Republick of <HI>Poland,</HI> one; Two from the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el;</HI> one from
<PB N="150" REF="170">
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> from the Dukes of <HI>Hannover, Lunenburgh, Wolfembuttle,</HI> and <HI>Zell,</HI> each one; from the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> one; and from the Cities of <HI>Liege</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> each one; be&s;ides Agents from <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the <HI>Gri&s;ons, Geneva,</HI> and <HI>Neufchattel.</HI></P>
<P>I need not mu&s;ter up to thee the Powers of the&s;e &s;everal Princes, who art &s;o well acquaint|ed with the State of <HI>Europe;</HI> but thou maye&s;t under&s;tand that there being a general Unani|mity in them all to unite again&s;t the growing Power of <HI>France;</HI> every one of the&s;e entered into Mea&s;ures and Agreements for &s;ome Pro|portion, either in Money or Troops, to &s;up|port the Alliance, and every one of them had &s;ome Preten&s;ions upon <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that like the A&s;&s;embly of the Birds, they all pretended to pluck their re&s;pective Feathers out of the Plume, wherewith the King of <HI>France</HI> has a|dorn'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Agreement of &s;o great a Number of Princes and Powers, will not be more wonder|ful to thee, than it will be that <HI>France</HI> has gone on &s;o long in a general Encroachment upon her Neighbours, to &s;uch a Degree, and for &s;o long a Time, till the whole World, as we may &s;ay, are aggrieved at her, and yet never be oppo&s;ed in a Body before: The Rea&s;on is, the Conduct of this Court has been &s;o very &s;ubtle, that the King has always found Means to di&s;unite the Princes whom he had oppre&s;s'd; and to break all the Mea&s;ures laid at any time for concerting any Oppo&s;ition to him: &s;o that he had them often in &s;ecret League with him|&s;elf, ready rather to oppo&s;e one another, than to join in Mea&s;ures to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>Thou wilt, doubtle&s;s, expect to hear what the King of <HI>France</HI> is doing all this while, and
<PB N="151" REF="171">
what Pro&s;pect there is of his defending him|&s;elf again&s;t &s;o many powerful Adver&s;aries. As to the fir&s;t, as I hinted already, they turn it all in publick to je&s;t and ridicule. They call the new King of <HI>England, Le Petit Prince d'Orange,</HI> and one of their &s;cribbling Poets here has written a Satyr or Lampoon, call'd the <HI>Cavalcade</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> wherein he pretends to give the Characters of all the Princes and great Per&s;ons of the Congre&s;s; but his Work is &s;o &s;currilous, and he treats Soveraign Princes with &s;uch Indecencies, and &s;uch mean cour&s;e Language, that indeed the <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen them&s;elves, who, to give them their due, are a very mannerly Nation, do not reli&s;h it.</P>
<P>However, at the &s;ame time that they treat the Notion of a grand Alliance again&s;t them with a Kind of Gayety and Contempt, the King &s;hews, that he knows the Prince of <HI>O|range,</HI> and that he is not in je&s;t; and accord|ingly he prepares to deal with him in earne&s;t; for his Army in <HI>Flanders</HI> will be in the whole, the Garri&s;ons included, 132000 Men, of which the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> who is to command them, pretends, on any Emergency, he will be able to have 110000 Men in the Field ready for Battle.</P>
<P>The Duke is a politick and a fortunate Gene|ral; but they &s;ay this of him, that he never came but to one Battle with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and then he was &s;oundly beaten, which was at the Battle of <HI>Mons,</HI> at the Clo&s;e of the la&s;t War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> of which I gave at that Time a full Account to <HI>Solyman,</HI> thy il|lu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;or, now an exalted Soldier of Prai&s;e in the Garden of Peace.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. To <HI>Hoganquin Zemel Atran,</HI> a Stu|dier of Antiquity at <HI>Zaabbachz</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOU that art &s;earching after ancient Knowledge, how can&s;t thou look into this Part of the World? where Men know no|thing but by a kind of Talmudical Know|ledge, receiving Error from their Fathers, and handing it on to their Po&s;terity, with the loo&s;e Sanction only of their own Approbation; &s;o that all things are accepted as Truths, be|cau&s;e received from the pa&s;t Generations.</P>
<P>You ask me for a Hi&s;tory of the ancient Gods, whom the <HI>Roman</HI> Nations adored; and how the Stars come to be &s;irnamed after the Deities they wor&s;hip?</P>
<P>I could give thee long Legends of Fables for the Original of the Gods, &s;ome one way, &s;ome
<PB N="153" REF="173">
another, as the Learning of the re&s;pective Ages tho&s;e things were written in directed, and as the &s;everal Authors who have written of &s;uch things have received them, &s;uch as <HI>Ste|phanus, Philo, Varro, Arnobius, Diodorus Siculus, Plato,</HI> and many more, too long to name.</P>
<P>But if I may give thee my Opinion of the&s;e things, it mu&s;t be, as I learnt them from the Leaves of the never fading Tree of <HI>Aphelezma,</HI> on which the Hi&s;tory of the World was writ|ten by the Angel of the Gate with a Pen of Adamant, I &s;ay, if I mu&s;t give thee my Opini|on, it is that thou direct thy Prayers to <HI>Mahomet</HI> three Times a Day for Illumination, and that thou &s;houlde&s;t be in&s;tructed in the everla&s;ting Record, that nothing pa&s;t may be concealed from thee.</P>
<P>Certainly the Introduction of Idols and Images to be wor&s;hiped by Men, was be|gun by the evil Spirit of the Lake; who, to era&s;e the Knowledge of the true One God, built Hou&s;es and Families of Gods in Ro|mance, founded on Traditional Di&s;coveries of things pa&s;t.</P>
<P>As this carried them back to the fir&s;t Know|ledge of things, &s;o it did al&s;o of Per&s;ons; and as none could be more the Subject of their In|quiries than the fir&s;t Men, &s;o upon the Fable of their Fame, for Time makes mighty Sto|ries dwindle into Romance, they made no Scruple to form the Gods which they want|ed to invent.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Records, which remain only in the &s;acred Repo&s;itory of the Cave of Won|ders, I &s;ay, from the&s;e Record of Traditions ri&s;e all the Gods they wanted; they a&s;cri|bed godlike things to Men gone before their
<PB N="154" REF="174">
Memory, and then conceiv'd of them as Gods on Account of their great Deeds.</P>
<P>Thus they go back to the Beginning of Men; and Saturn, who is called the Father of all, both Gods and Men, was certainly no other than <HI>Adam,</HI> the Primogenitor of the Creation, to whom the whole Globe was given in Fee &s;imple, as Lord of the Soil.</P>
<P>As <HI>Adam</HI> was the fir&s;t <HI>Saturn,</HI> &s;o <HI>Cain</HI> ap|pears to be the fir&s;t <HI>Jupiter; Eve</HI> was al&s;o called the Godde&s;s <HI>Rhea;</HI> and <HI>Naamath, Eve</HI>'s elde&s;t Daughter and <HI>Cain</HI>'s Wife, was called <HI>Venus; Tubulcain</HI> is the &s;ame they called <HI>Vulcan.</HI> Nor is the Similitude of Sound yet worn quite out of the Words; for taking away the Let|ters <HI>Tu</HI> from the Word, and you find not much of any kind of Difference between <HI>Bulcain</HI> and <HI>Vulcan.</HI></P>
<P>I know that &s;ucceeding Generations, in Imitation of this fir&s;t Nomination of Gods, named al&s;o the Heroes of their own Ance&s;tors by the &s;ame Names; placing them in the Skies as Stars of Eminence, and adored them as Gods; but the&s;e are modern, compared to the Original as above, which I take to be the Work of the fir&s;t Ages of Time.</P>
<P>From the Tales which the <HI>Antediluvians,</HI> as they call them here, handed down to their Po&s;terity, came mo&s;t of the Fables with which the Ea&s;tern Part of the World was &s;o full, &s;ome of which I find here in their an|cient Poets and Hi&s;torians, &s;uch as <HI>Homer, He&s;iod, Ovid, Cornelius Severus,</HI> and others; for Example:</P>
<P>From the building that great &s;tupendious Stair-Ca&s;e, called the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> the &s;aid Poets feigned the Story of <HI>Pelion</HI> upon <HI>O&s;&s;a,</HI> or the Giants undertaking a War again&s;t the
<PB N="155" REF="175">
Gods, and throwing one Mountain upon ano|ther to a&s;&s;ault Heaven, which is admirably de&s;cribed by one of the &s;aid Poets thus:<Q><L>Tentav&ecirc;re (nefas) olim detrudere mundo</L>
<L>Sydera, Captivi&abque; <HI>Jovis</HI> transferre Gigantes:</L>
<L>Imperium, &amp; victo leges imponere coelo.</L>
<BIBL>Cor. Sev.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e from the authentick Hi&s;tories of the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> and their dividing the Earth among their Po&s;terity, came the Fa|ble of dividing the World among the Three Brethren the Sons of <HI>Saturn.</HI> The Fiction of the golden Fruit kept by the Dragon was ta|ken from the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> where was a forbidden Tree guarded by the divine Ana|thema.</P>
<P>And, as &s;ome tell us, from the tran&s;lating <HI>Enoch</HI> into Heaven, was taken the Tran&s;lation of Heroes and famous Men into Stars and cele&s;tial Signs, and the like.</P>
<P>Now if thou read the wondrous Manu&s;cripts of the Ancients, which thou wilt find trea|&s;ured up in the miraculous Cave, and colle|cted with great Indu&s;try by the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Arabians;</HI> thou wilt find the full Confirmation of the&s;e Truths, and ju&s;t Rea&s;on to trace the Antiquity of the Heathen Fiction back to the fir&s;t Age.</P>
<P>Innumerable Similitudes will appear al&s;o if thou &s;tudy <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s written Law, where thou wilt find the Cu&s;tom of Kings and Conque|rors making Leagues, Covenants, and Conven|tions, confirmed by the Sanction of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and mutual Sacrifices, is borrowed from <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> who, when he read the Covenant of God to the People, &s;prinkled the Blood of the Sa|crifice upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="176">
Wherefore then, divine <HI>Atran,</HI> doe&s;t thou turn thy Face this Way for the Intelligence of things ancient? &s;eeing the di&s;pers'd Fa|milies of the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> have not left the Ea&s;tern World without authentick Proofs of their Original, and of the Cu&s;toms of their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>I know the <HI>Lybian</HI> Fables, take the original of the Gods of the <HI>Greeks</HI> from the <HI>Africans,</HI> where <HI>Uranus,</HI> they &s;ay, fir&s;t reigned, a Name which &s;ignified <HI>Heaven;</HI> and who, for his Knowledge of the Stars, his People honoured after his Death, as a Star in Heaven.</P>
<P>This <HI>Uranus,</HI> they &s;ay, was the Father of the Titanes or Giants; his Wife al&s;o &s;irnamed <HI>Titea,</HI> was canoniz'd for a Godde&s;s; her Name &s;igni|fying Earth. Thus Heaven and Earth married together, their Son <HI>Hyperion</HI> marrying his Si&s;ter <HI>Ba&s;ilea:</HI> She bore him two Children, called <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>The re&s;t of the&s;e fictitious Tales are too long to trouble thee with, and only &s;erve to let thee know, how ignorant of more ancient Truth tho&s;e Nations were, and that the more genuine, and indeed only Fund of Antiquity, is trea&s;u|red up in the Archives of <HI>Churuth,</HI> and the Re|po&s;itories of the holy Mountain, where if thou pray to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> thou &s;halt have Wi&s;dom, and have the ju&s;t Di&s;coveries of retired Truth made known to thee.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. To the Captain Ba&s;&s;a.</HEAD>
<P>I Should omit the Duty I owe to thy high Station in the Empire of the Faithful, if I did not acquaint thee of the greate&s;t Battle, or Sea-fight, which, perhaps, was ever fought in the&s;e Parts of the World; whether we regard the Strength of the Fleets, or the Vigour and Con&s;equence of the Action.</P>
<P>The Glory and Ambition of the King of <HI>France,</HI> e&s;pecially in his maritine Affairs, thou ha&s;t been no Stranger to for many Years; nor art thou ignorant that he was really arrived to a Greatne&s;s at Sea, amazing to all tho&s;e who knew the Circum&s;tances he formerly &s;tood in with re&s;pect to his Neighbours of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and how the former not only were &s;u|perior to him in Naval Strength, but pretend|ed to forbid him encrea&s;ing that Power, or building any more Ships whenever they thought fit.</P>
<P>It was but the la&s;t Year but one that we &s;aw the Fleet of <HI>France</HI> engaging tho&s;e of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> in the open Seas, and being &s;uperior to them both, as well in the Number of Ships, as in the Force of tho&s;e Ships, we found the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> retreating from them, declining the Fight, and at length wor&s;ted.</P>
<P>The next Year the Fleets of <HI>France</HI> were reckon'd 100 Sail of capital Men of War of the Line, <HI>(viz.)</HI> from 50 Guns upwards to 110
<PB N="158" REF="178">
Guns, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets were not &s;o forward to engage them as was u&s;ual.</P>
<P>But this Year, by I know not what Fate, whether the Vigilance and Diligence of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Admiral, or the Ra&s;hne&s;s and Pride of the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, I know not; but this Year, I &s;ay, has been fatal to the King of <HI>France,</HI> in his Naval Affairs; and in a great Battle at Sea, his Fleet has been entirely overthrown; and about 20 of the bigge&s;t Men of War in his Navy, and indeed &s;ome of them the big|ge&s;t in the World, have been burnt or de|&s;troyed; a Lo&s;s, which I fore&s;ee <HI>France</HI> will not be able to re&s;tore in many Years, if at all.</P>
<P>They came together upon the mo&s;t natural Terms imaginable; for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tourville,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, tho' he had not in his whole Fleet above 52 Sail, went boldly into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Channel, to &s;eek out his Enemies, who were near 90 Sail. Thou wilt rea&s;onably con|clude, that when the weaker looks out for the &s;tronger, there will be little Difficulty to meet.</P>
<P>The Fight was bloody, and there is no doubt but had the <HI>French</HI> been equal in Number to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets, they would have had the better of them; but a great Di&s;propor|tion of Numbers left the <HI>French</HI> Room for nothing but to make the be&s;t of their way to their own Coa&s;t, after an unequal Fight; in which no Behaviour of the particular Cap|tains and Officers could atone for the intolle|rable Ra&s;hne&s;s of the Admiral, in attacking the Enemy when he might have declined it, and ea&s;ily &s;aw the Di&s;parity of Strength.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> &s;ay, in Ju&s;tification of the Ad|miral, that he had po&s;itive and expre&s;s Orders to fight the Confederates wherever he met
<PB N="159" REF="179">
them; but 'tis alledg'd in Reply, that this was with a Suppo&s;ition of a probable Ad|vantage, or at lea&s;t a fair Ca&s;t for it; not to fight at all Adventures, two again&s;t three, where they would be &s;ure to have the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>However it was, the King, who is the be&s;t Judge of his own Orders, received the Admi|ral perfectly well, &s;poke cheerfully to him, and was very far from &s;howing any Re&s;entment again&s;t his Conduct, as if he had not obeyed Orders.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s the <HI>French</HI> has &s;u&s;tained is ine&s;tima|ble, 17 of the fine&s;t Ships the World ever &s;aw, are burnt and de&s;troyed in their own Harbours, and in Sight of their own People, be&s;ides others &s;maller; a Sight &s;o mortifying, &s;o dreadful, and particularly &s;o provoking to the Seamen, who long'd for nothing more than to have fought it out Ship for Ship, and Man for Man; that they tore the very Hair from their Heads for Rage, to &s;ee the Ships burnt in their own Ports.</P>
<P>But there was no Remedy, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets were upon them; the re&s;t of their own Fleet was &s;eparated, and fled through the Race of Alderney for <HI>Bre&s;t;</HI> whereupon they &s;et Fire to the Ships with their own Hands, after having &s;aved out of them whatever was portable, and placed the Hulls &s;o as the Guns might be ea&s;ily weighed.</P>
<P>Never was &s;uch a Blaze of Fire &s;een on Earth, the Light was &s;een in the Air an Hundred Miles, to the infinite Terror of the People.</P>
<P>The Troops which were drawn up on the Shore, prevented the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> landing; and by &s;ome Cannon planted on large Batteries, kept off the Boats a great while which were &s;ent in to burn the Ships, and by tho&s;e Batteries
<PB N="160" REF="180">
they protected two Men of War which were not burnt.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of Men has not been great; the Account they give is about 2500 Men killed, and 3000 wounded. Nor have the Enemy lo&s;t much le&s;s; but the Lo&s;s of the Ships is &s;uch as the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves do not pretend to be able to repair in many Years. And &s;ince this Di&s;a&s;ter, they advi&s;e the King to &s;pare the ex|ce&s;&s;ive Expences of fitting out &s;o great a Fleet, and employ the Seamen in &s;mall Crui&s;ers, to attack the Commerce of the Allies, who abound in Numbers of Merchant-Ships in all Parts of the Sea.</P>
<P>This had been good Advice, had it been given before; had the King of <HI>France</HI> laid up his great Fleet, and encouraged his Sub|jects to &s;it out Privateers, he had &s;aved the Expence of thirty Millions a Year, and wound|ed his Enemies in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part, <HI>(viz.)</HI> their Trade; by which they &s;upported all the re&s;t of their Power.</P>
<P>But this is late Advice now, and makes good a proverbial Saying of the mo&s;t learned of the <HI>Nazareens, (viz)</HI> that the <HI>Italians</HI> are wi&s;e be|forehand, the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> in the Action, and the <HI>French</HI> after 'tis done.</P>
<P>This Blow to the Naval Power of <HI>France</HI> may not be without its good Con&s;equences to thy Affairs: Our glorious Ma&s;ter the Grand Seignior knows what u&s;e to make of it, to the exalting the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power in the <HI>Levant,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ting it to maintain a ju&s;t Superiority of Naval Strength in every Part of the World.</P>
<P>Glory and Succe&s;s attend the Navies of thy Lord, under thy wi&s;e and pro&s;perous Conduct, invincible Admiral of the faithful Navy; and may the En&s;igns of <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;pread the Seas at

the Ports of thy Enemies, that the Top&s;ails of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> may &s;trike to the victorious Pendants of the Admiral-Galley, under the Awe of thy Sword and of the Grand Seignior's in|vincible Power.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. To <HI>Amurath Zahabbezin,,</HI> a pro&s;ely|ted Jew of <HI>Trapezond.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' I believe thou art a true Mu&s;&s;el|man, and ha&s;t for&s;aken the Errors of thy mi&s;taken Brethren, yet I find by thy Letters that thou art yet of the Rabbinical Principle, and art a kind of <HI>Mahometan</HI> Phari&s;ee: for thou can&s;t not refrain in all thy Notions of things, to put a mighty Stre&s;s upon the Tradition of our Ance&s;tors, as if the Alcoran, which thou knowe&s;t we believe came down from Heaven to our great Prophet, needed any Explana|tions.</P>
<P>It's evident to me, that the Laws of God, handed to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by the Mini&s;tration of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> coming immediately from the divine Oracle, &s;poken by the Mouth of God him&s;elf, and written down by the Pen of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the faithful Collector of what God had &s;poken to him, re|quired no Explanations: It is to me a &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="162" REF="182">
Objection again&s;t the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Talmud, the <HI>Gemara,</HI> and all the Writings which are called the Collections of the Elders, that they all differ from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law, or the Writings of the Prophets, in the Preface or Introduction of them all; for that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> introduces all his Precepts with, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord: The Lord &s;pake all the&s;e Words, and &s;aid: The Word of the Lord came unto me&mdash;&s;aying: The Lord hath &s;poken,</HI> and the like. <HI>WHEREAS</HI> in the Talmud, and all the Collections of traditional Explana|tions, it is &s;aid, by way of Introduction, <HI>Rabbi Simeon,</HI> Says thus: <HI>Rabbi Juda,</HI> Says thus: <HI>Rabbi Eliezer,</HI> Says thus, and the like</P>
<P>And wherefore &s;eeke&s;t thou a cabbali&s;tick Scheme, or a Collection of traditional Expla|nations upon the perfect Law of <HI>Mahomet?</HI> Art thou ignorant how the Alcoran was brought down from Heaven, and given to our great Apo&s;tle <HI>Mahomet?</HI> and that every Mu&s;&s;elman believes that it requires no other Law to explain or enforce it?</P>
<P>It is true that we have a <HI>Sonnah,</HI> in which are &s;aid to be contained traditional Explanati|ons of the Text of the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> but the Prin|ciples of the Mu&s;&s;elman's Belief are &s;uch, &s;o plain and &s;o few, that no <HI>Sonnah,</HI> no traditio|nal Precepts, can add to or explain: Our whole Faith being contained in the&s;e two great Fundamentals,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> That God is but one God, and that <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his Apo&s;tle or Prophet.</P>
<P>The <HI>SONNAH,</HI> or <HI>MISNA</HI> of our Law, may explain the Precepts of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> re|&s;pecting the Conduct of his Di&s;ciples or Fol|lowers; but the great Point denominating a true Mu&s;&s;elman, <HI>(viz.)</HI> believing the Unity of Per&s;on, and the Dignity of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> admits
<PB N="163" REF="183">
no Explanation; neither is the <HI>Sonnah</HI> of our Emirs concern'd in &s;uch a bla&s;phemous At|tempt.</P>
<P>Leave off then, enlightened <HI>Morat,</HI> thy old cabbali&s;tick Notions, and le&s;&s;en thy E&s;teem for traditional Ideas; believe that <HI>God is One God,</HI> and that <HI>Mahomet</HI> is <HI>his Prophet,</HI> and enjoys the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Eden,</HI> the promi&s;ed Plea&s;ures of Pa|radi&s;e, where Oceans of inexpre&s;&s;ible Bli&s;s flow down in Streams of Delight, where Millions of &s;hining Beauties attend the Faithful, &s;uch as &s;hould one of them appear on Earth, all Man|kind would dye for the Love of her, and &s;ink into inconceivable Torment at the Lo&s;s of her.</P>
<P>Give no Jealou&s;ies to thy Friends, that thou art not thoroughly inform'd, and ha&s;t not em|braced the right Way with a perfect Mind.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be true that the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> may &s;tand in need of Interpretations, and the Solutions of learned and judicious Men in doubtful and difficult Ca&s;es, about their &s;ab|battical Ob&s;ervations, legal Retributions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be u&s;eful Precedents for the Judgment of the Elders, in like Ca&s;es, among the <HI>Jews</HI> to this Time.</P>
<P>Tho' I confe&s;s, I believe all tho&s;e Traditions and Precedents have rather corrupted than in|formed their Po&s;terity, and have &s;pread a Cloud or Veil of Darkne&s;s over their Law, rather than cleared it up from any Difficulties that were in it before.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e it &s;o; for I know the Rabbi|ni&s;ts, who are the chief &s;ort of <HI>Jews,</HI> who I meet with in the&s;e Parts of the World, do all &s;trictly adhere to the Voice of the Elders, and therefore the whole Study of their Doctors is employed upon the <HI>Mi&s;na,</HI> which is the origi|nal
<PB N="164" REF="184">
authentick Text of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Traditions, or Opinions of the Elders.</P>
<P>Yet what is all this to the true Mu&s;&s;elmen? who believe that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was a Prophet &s;ent from God, and that God gave him a Body of written Laws, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Alcoran? &s;eeing we have no need of Rabbinical Authorities or traditional In&s;titutes for the Under&s;tanding that Law.</P>
<P>I am told here by &s;ome of the learned Fa|thers or Rabbies of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> that one <HI>Nicholas Clenardus,</HI> a famous Man in the Study of the Laws of the Me&s;&s;iah, and fill'd with Learning in all the Languages which were in u&s;e in the&s;e Parts of the World, got a Pa&s;sport about 160 Years ago, <HI>(viz)</HI> the Year 1541. from the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> for Leave to come to <HI>Fez</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> the capital City of the Moores, to &s;tudy the <HI>Arabick</HI> Language, which, at that Time, not &s;carce a Scholar in all the <HI>Naza|reen</HI> World could read a Word of.</P>
<P>It &s;eems his De&s;ign was, that he might then &s;earch, and open a Door for others to &s;earch after him, into the Fundamentals of our Prin|ciples; examine the Alcoran; read the Hi&s;to|ries of our great Prophet; &s;tudy the <HI>SONNAHS</HI> of the ancient Emirs, and of the &s;acred <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">reh,</HI> and all the Collections of traditional Know|ledge they could reach, in order to put the People here into a Method to di&s;pute &s;ucce&s;s|fully again&s;t the Mu&s;&s;elmen-Doctors and Der|vices, as Occa&s;ion might offer.</P>
<P>But what did all the Study of this famous Man amount to? for I hear he lived there ele|ven Years, in which Time he made him&s;elf perfect Ma&s;ter of the Tongue, and likewi&s;e en|quired fully into the Laws of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> but
<PB N="165" REF="185">
with what Succe&s;s may be &s;een by the re&s;t of his Life: He became afterwards a Profe&s;&s;or of <HI>Arabic</HI> in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Prague,</HI> and after that, in &s;everal other Places, and left &s;o many Scholars, who were Ma&s;ters of the Language, in divers Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that the learned Men here have a tollerable Skill in the Tongue to this Day.</P>
<P>But not one Di&s;pute with any Mu&s;&s;elman has ever, that I have heard of, been managed in con&s;equence of this learned Man's elabo|rate Studies; nor have they been able to enter into any one Argument again&s;t the one great Fundamental of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Laws, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That there is but One God, or that <HI>GOD IS ONE.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore then &s;tudie&s;t thou, learned <HI>Morat,</HI> to bring us to the <HI>Rabbinick</HI> Method of Ex|planations in our Law? &s;uch as the Traditions of our ancient Mufti's, and Doctors in <HI>Maho|met</HI>'s Law, things of very little U&s;e while the Precepts of <HI>Mahomet</HI> are explicit and plain, ful|ly directing the Faithful.</P>
<P>Thou wilt labour in Light to bring forth Darkne&s;s; for verily, as the Traditions of the Elders have eclips'd the true Light of God's Law among the <HI>Jews;</HI> &s;o all the Studies of the mo&s;t learned Men that are, or that &s;hall be hereafter, will not add to the Light of the true Believers, in&s;pired by their great Prophet to choo&s;e the right Way.</P>
<P>Nay, as thou art already convinc'd that the Traditions of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Cabbala, contain in them many things immoral and unju&s;t, and that therefore as thou ha&s;t well argued again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> from whom thou art, (happily for thee) &s;eparated by the Light of Wi&s;dom; &s;o thou maye&s;t well conclude the&s;e Rabbinick Traditions infamous, and to be rejected; &s;ince

<HEAD>LETTER XII. To the <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> or Secretary of State.</HEAD>
<P>THE Angels of Paradi&s;e &s;urround the Dominions of thy Lord, the Dew of <HI>Hemus,</HI> the &s;hining of <HI>Aarathes,</HI> the Calms of <HI>Maathaon</HI> attend thy con&s;tant Labours in the Service of the happy Emperor of the World.</P>
<P>The Empire of the <HI>Franks</HI> begins to &s;uffer Convul&s;ions, which no Power on Earth has been ever able to bring her to before; the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> a poor and contemptible Prince, reduced the la&s;t Year to &s;uch Extremities, that his Friends began to talk of his ca&s;ting him&s;elf upon the Clemency of the <HI>French King,</HI> has this Year appeared at the Head of an Army &s;o &s;u|perior to the <HI>French,</HI> that, di&s;daining to attack the Towns he had lo&s;t, or &s;o much as to attempt to recover his Dominions out of the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> he has boldly enter'd <HI>France</HI> with his Army, and penetrated into the Province of <HI>Dauphine</HI> at the Head of 45000 Men.</P>
<P>In this Attempt the <HI>French</HI> &s;eem perfectly &s;urprized; they have no Force at hand able to make Head again&s;t him; the Duke has taken <HI>Guille&s;tre, Gap, Ambrun,</HI> and have laid all the Country far and near under Contribution.</P>
<P>This is what <HI>France</HI> has not felt for many Ages, all the Power of the Nations, by which the <HI>French</HI> have been &s;o vigorou&s;ly attack'd, have not been able till now &s;o much as to

&s;et a Foot into her Dominions; &s;he has always carried the War into her Enemy's Country, and maintained her Troops at the Expence of the Nations &s;he has made War with.</P>
<P>But now while the King of <HI>France</HI> triumph|ed, as it were, in the Ruine of this Prince, had taken from him the Port of <HI>Nice,</HI> and the City of <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> with all the Country ad|joining; al&s;o the City of <HI>Chamberry,</HI> the im|pregnable Fortre&s;s of <HI>Montmelian,</HI> the Town and Citadel of <HI>Suza,</HI> and the whole Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and gave out that they would attack <HI>Turin,</HI> the Capital of his Dominions; I &s;ay, in this Poverty of his Circum&s;tances, the Duke receives a Supply of 18000 <HI>Germans</HI> in a Body; al&s;o 6000 Men rai&s;ed by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and a great Sum of Money from the &s;ame Powers; and ma|king the Mare&s;chal <HI>Catinat,</HI> who was the Ter|ror of the <HI>Savoyard</HI> before, retreat to <HI>Pignerol;</HI> he in&s;ults the Dominions of <HI>France,</HI> and enters the Heart of the Province of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> filling all Places with the Terror of an inva&s;ive War.</P>
<P>This is a terrible Mortification to the King of <HI>France:</HI> It mu&s;t be a Blow to the Glory of a Man, the mo&s;t ambitious of Fame in the World; and it is a greater Affliction, as it is from a Hand which they de&s;pi&s;ed &s;o much, that it would not more &s;urprize thee to find the Dominions of the Grand Seignior invaded by the Knights of <HI>Maltha.</HI></P>
<P>This Attack has rouz'd the Court from the Lethargy of their Plea&s;ures: The State&s;men are filled with Indignation at the In&s;ult offer'd the King; the Soldiery are eager to be put in|to a Condition to engage the <HI>Savoyard,</HI> and make him pay dear for the Attempt; but the
<PB N="169" REF="189">
Truth is, all Hands are employed; the King has &s;o many Broils upon his Hands, that he is not able to apply a &s;uitable Remedy to the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs: In &s;hort, there are no Troops, tho' the King of <HI>France</HI> has Three Hundred Thou|&s;and Men in Pay; yet he has &s;uch Embarra&s;&s;|ments on his Hands, that he knows not where to detach Ten Thou&s;and Men, to protect his own Dominions from an Inva&s;ion, which it was below him &s;o much as to think of, without leaving him&s;elf open to &s;ome other Enemy, ready to break in at the Gap which tho&s;e Ten Thou&s;and Men would make in his Defences.</P>
<P>This &s;hews the mi&s;taken Arrogance of this Nation in general, founded on the Flatteries of the Courtiers, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that <HI>France</HI> alone was able to make War again&s;t the whole united Powers of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They are, however, obliged to venture it; and &s;trong Detachments are ordered to be made from <HI>Rou&s;illon,</HI> from <HI>French Comte,</HI> and from the upper <HI>Rhine;</HI> who make long Matches to join Mon&s;ieur <HI>Catinat;</HI> but it mu&s;t be at lea&s;t Forty Days March ere &s;ome of them can come up to him; and what Conque&s;ts the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> may make in that Time we know not.</P>
<P>They tremble at the very Gates of <HI>Lyons,</HI> one of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t Cities in <HI>France;</HI> they repair the Fortifications at <HI>Thoulon,</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> as if they fear'd a Siege. In a Word, all <HI>France</HI> is in a Con&s;ternation, to find 40000 Men entred into the Heart of the Country, and no Forces ready, or at lea&s;t in Condition to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>The King alone &s;hews a Temper fitted for &s;uch a Surprize; when every one el&s;e di&s;cover the Con&s;ternation they are in, the King &s;peaks
<PB N="170" REF="190">
cheerfully, &s;miles at the Mention of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and tells the Courtiers, the Duke and he &s;hall be good Friends for all this, and he will go back again quietly.</P>
<P>What the King means, none knows but him|&s;elf; but as all the King &s;ays is received here as an Oracle, the People take Heart at it, without any other Foundation than that the King &s;ays it; &s;o true is it, that it becomes Kings, and Ge|nerals of Armies, never to &s;hew any Concern at whatever Dangers threaten them; for the Eyes of the whole Nation are upon them and will be dejected or encouraged, ju&s;t as the Countenance of their King or General ap|pears anxious or gay.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trious Coun&s;ellor of the Prince of Em|perors, how glorious is the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Throne? &s;hining with the Lu&s;tre of Heaven, guarded by the Hands of Millions of the Faithful, and guided by the Prudence of wi&s;e Councils? No In&s;ults can be offer'd her unrevenged, no Enemies a&s;&s;ault her uncha&s;tized; how happy is thy Station, who, by Office, dwelle&s;t at the Feet of Maje&s;ty, clothed with the Moon, crown'd with the Sun?

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. To <HI>Morat Ebn Allwazhhair,,</HI> a learn|ed Man, &s;tudying A&s;tronomy at <HI>Ha|dramurt</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT art thou doing, thou retired Man? and wherefore art thou buried alive the&s;e Five and Thirty Years? being wrapt up among the Stars, and beating thy Brains with innumerable Rolls of Figures, for the Calcula|tions of the Revolution of Commets, and the E|clip&s;es of the Planets, in the Sy&s;tems of the pla|netary Worlds not yet di&s;covered?</P>
<P>It is Fifteen Years ago &s;ince thou wrote&s;t to me, that thou had&s;t for twenty Years before &s;pent thy whole Study in a fruitle&s;s Endeavour to &s;upport the old Philo&s;ophy, and demon|&s;trate the <HI>Ptolomaian</HI> Sy&s;tem, again&s;t the Ob|jections of the Moderns, and again&s;t the No|tions of the <HI>European</HI> Philo&s;ophers; being very loth tho&s;e Infidels, who had not Sen&s;e to em|brace the &s;ame ju&s;t Notions in Religion with thy &s;elf, &s;hould be able to arrive to a Degree of Knowledge, in Science, &s;uperior to that which the ancient learned <HI>Arabians</HI> fir&s;t dictated; for from them <HI>Ptolomey</HI> received the Rudiments and Elements of the cele&s;tial Motions, which he form'd into a Scheme, and got the Honour of having it called by his Name.</P>
<P>But after Twenty Years Study, it &s;eems thou art obliged to acknowledge the &s;uperior Ex|cellence of the Copernican Scheme, and the
<PB N="172" REF="192">
farther Improvements and Additions of the new Philo&s;ophy, and that accordingly thou ha&s;t &s;ound Methods to &s;olve all the difficult Phoe|nomena which &s;o di&s;tracted <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and the greate&s;t Men of Knowledge in the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I am therefore to &s;uppo&s;e thee now, poring upon the Motions of the Planets in the &s;olar Sy&s;tem, where thou ha&s;t &s;et the Sun in the Center, as is no Que&s;tion its due; being the Life, the Guide, the &s;overeign Director (under God the great Director); and in a Word, the very Soul and Being of the whole Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>It may be thou ha&s;t &s;pent &s;ome time, perhaps Years, to draw the ju&s;t Proportions of Gravi|tation, by which the Di&s;tances and Magnitude of the Planets are only to be known; and per|haps thou ha&s;t di&s;cover'd, as I have done here, by looking into the like Calculations, in the Study of learned Men here, that the Magni|tude of the Sun, and our Di&s;tance from it, and likewi&s;e the Di&s;tance of all the other Planets from it, and from one another, are infinitely greater than they were &s;uppo&s;ed by our Ance|&s;tors to be, and perhaps infinitely greater than we yet think them to be; &s;eeing every Cal|culation that has yet been ju&s;tly, and with good Judgment made, carries the Sun farther and farther from us, and adds to its Dimen|tions; till from fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing it to be 366 times bigger than the Earth, we are now come to know that it is no le&s;s than 900000 times bigger; and that its Di&s;tance is in Proportion remov'd: So that we now &s;peak of the Earth's being above 60 Millions of Miles, and &s;ome &s;ay 81 Millions of Geometrical Miles di&s;tant from the Sun.</P>
<P>That all the Planets gravitate to the Sun, and the Sun to them, in ju&s;t, tho' differing Pro|portions, and that all tho&s;e Proportions are
<PB N="173" REF="193">
known and calculated, in a regular Manner, by the Rules of Art, I &s;ee no Room to que&s;ti|on; and I doubt not but when thou &s;ee&s;t &s;ome of the Calculations of the pre&s;ent Ma&s;ters in this noble Study, which I &s;end thee herewith, thou wilt readily acknowledge that they are very accurate.</P>
<P>The Improvements made here in the Study of the&s;e things are exceeding great; the King gives all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement to &s;uch Stu|dies; has built them an Ob&s;ervatory at a pro|digious Expence, and furni&s;h'd them with Gla&s;&s;es, for Ob&s;ervation, of the be&s;t that can be found in the World; and every Man who ap|plies to this Study, is allowed the U&s;e of tho&s;e Gla&s;&s;es; by the Help of which, it is wonderful to con&s;ider what new Di&s;coveries in Nature Men daily make, and to what Perfection in Art they are arriv'd.</P>
<P>Happy <HI>Morat,</HI> thou who receive&s;t by the &s;ublime Intellect a &s;uperior In&s;truction, art not doubtfully inform'd of all the&s;e things, and I congratulate the Advances which thou ha&s;t made, in that yet more un&s;earchable Branch of A&s;tronomical Knowledge, <HI>(viz)</HI> the Revo|lutions, Number, Magnitude, and Di&s;tance of the Comets; Bodies altogether out of our reach as well as out of our Sight.</P>
<P>This difficult Study, if thou can&s;t bring it to Perfection, will put an End to all the en|thu&s;ia&s;tick Whim&s;ies of the&s;e <HI>Nazareens,</HI> who are continually poring upon, and making Cal|culations of the general Point, of Nature when Time &s;hall fini&s;h its Circle, and the Pul&s;e of Nature beat no more.</P>
<P>For if, as we firmly believe the general Conflagration, which is the End of all things, &s;hall be perform'd by the Flame of a Co|met,
<PB N="174" REF="194">
which, in its direct Motion, &s;hall, at the appointed Hour of Nature, come &s;o near this Earth, as to &s;et both it and the Moon, and per|haps all the Planets of our Sy&s;tem on Fire; &s;o if thou can&s;t arrive, by a ju&s;t Calculation, at the Knowledge of the proper Revolution of this one Comet, thou &s;halt be able, without any other prophetick In&s;piration, to tell us to a Minute; nay, to one Second of Time, when, and in what manner the Conflagration of this Earth, and, in a Word, the End of all things &s;hall begin.</P>
<P>This noble Study is worthy indeed of all thy Powers; and as thou art already in the Garden of Knowledge, and drinke&s;t daily of the in&s;piring Streams of <HI>Aroa jairoth,</HI> a Branch of the Brook of <HI>Eden,</HI> either thou wilt attain this highe&s;t Pinnacle of Knowledge, or I mu&s;t conclude that God, for wi&s;e and ju&s;t Rea&s;ons, has entirely concealed this Knowledge from Men, perhaps until <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;hall be &s;ent down again to bring &s;upernatural Light into the World.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Morat,</HI> as thou ha&s;t doubtle&s;s made infinite Di&s;coveries in the Secrets of Nature, and in the Motions, Order, and Oeconomy of the cele&s;tial Bodies, why &s;hould&s;t thou not communicate to others the Parts proper to be known, that &s;ucceeding Time may enjoy the Advantage of thy Labours and Study?</P>
<P>For thou knowe&s;t well, divine <HI>Morat,</HI> that &s;o the De&s;tination of righteous Power has ap|pointed, that Knowledge dies with Men, and is not conveyed by Generation, or bequeath|ed by Te&s;tament to our Heirs.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient, and what we rejoice in, that the <HI>Capacities</HI> of being in&s;tructed are <HI>often</HI> convey|ed as the Con&s;equences of a &s;ublimer, &s;pirituous
<PB N="175" REF="195">
Nature, in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Generation; the Semen partaking of the extraordinary Vi|gor of its Ance&s;tor, prepares the Ca&s;e, (which &s;hall embody the &s;ub&s;equent Soul) with dila|ted Organs, and extended Parts, adapted for the full Reception of a capacious Intellect; and thus the Son often partakes of the natural Endowments of the Father; but never of the acquir'd, till by the &s;ame Erudition and Ap|plication he furni&s;hes him&s;elf, after the Ex|ample of his indefatigable Parent</P>
<P>Mark, I &s;ay, they are the Capacities of Na|ture which are thus convey'd by Generation, and that tho' the&s;e are OFTEN &s;o conveyed, yet that it is not &s;o <HI>always;</HI> on the contrary, we frequently find, that as among the Kings of thy Nation, a weak, &s;upine, &s;tupid <HI>Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hoboam</HI> &s;ucceeded a wi&s;e and incomparably knowing <HI>Solomon;</HI> &s;o Ideots and Fools are often the Pro|duction of generating Philo&s;ophers and Politi|cians; But I return to thy particular Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Since then all this Knowledge mu&s;t die with thee, and thou &s;halt carry from thy Children the whole Sum of Forty or Fifty Years Study with thee into Paradi&s;e, there to delight thy &s;elf in the con&s;ummate Di&s;covery, and that all this &s;hall prepare thee only for the &s;uperi|our Delights of the Garden of Wi&s;dom, what Profit &s;hall the World reap from thee, if thou communicate not the Elements of thy Wi&s;|dom for Po&s;terity to build upon?</P>
<P>The Infidels, among whom I dwell, boa&s;t|ing of the Improvements they make in the &s;ublime&s;t Branches of humane Knowledge, re|proach the Mu&s;&s;elmen of the Ea&s;tern World with being Enemies of Learning, and perfect|ly void of the Advantages of Science, living
<PB N="176" REF="196">
like meer Animals, as they &s;ay, without the Study, or De&s;ire of Knowledge and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>They di&s;cover their own Ignorance and In|ju&s;tice in this, not having been acquainted with the numerous Retreats of the mo&s;t knowing and mo&s;t &s;tudious Searches after Wi&s;dom in the World, and which, at this Day, take up the happy Plains of <HI>Hadrumurt,</HI> the Vallies of <HI>Saada,</HI> and the golden Hills of <HI>Oman,</HI> the mo&s;t delicious Part of <HI>Arabia Faelix,</HI> where the in&s;pired Souls of wi&s;e Men are ravi&s;h'd with the Delights of Wi&s;dom, and where Knowledge it &s;elf takes Plea&s;ure to dwell.</P>
<P>But in this they might ju&s;tly blame us if they were &s;en&s;ible where alone we are defici|ent, that whereas the true Searchers after Knowledge find there infinite Di&s;coveries be|yond all that Nature has own'd her &s;elf to be furni&s;h'd with in other Parts of the World; yet the Proficients, ravi&s;h'd with the inex|pre&s;&s;ible Joy of knowing whole Nature, live out their Years in their &s;ilent Raptures, with|out leaving behind them, in laborious Vo|lumes, due Schemes of the Di&s;coveries they make.</P>
<P>I tell the People here, if they would know perfectly the Secrets of Wi&s;dom, and have the re&s;erved Trea&s;ures of Nature entirely open|ed to them, they mu&s;t go and dwell among the Fathers of Wi&s;dom, in the Di&s;trict of <HI>Raled,</HI> and drink of the Waters of <HI>Cazimurt,</HI> where Learning is in&s;pired by that Breath of God, the Air; and Wi&s;dom flows in a Stream like the River.</P>
<P>But then I add, that they will, like them, write no Books, and the World will receive no Advantage from the Learning and Know|ledge of their Forefathers.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="197">
O <HI>Morat,</HI> in this <HI>only</HI> I would have thee imi|tate the <HI>Nazareens;</HI> and as thou ha&s;t made &s;uch Advances in humane Learning as the World never yet knew, communicate thy Knowledge, for the Good of Mankind; and let the&s;e Infi|dels hereafter confe&s;s them&s;elves beholding to a learned <HI>Arab</HI> for more Di&s;coveries into ce|le&s;tial Nature than all the Telle&s;copes of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> or the Studies of a Thou&s;and Univer&s;ities, could &s;upply.</P>

<P>_I Know thy worth, and thy Expe|rience in martial Affairs, thy Cou|rage, and the Wounds which thou ha&s;t received in thy faithful Ser|vices to the Grand Seignior: I re|member the Services of thy Father, who lo&s;t one of his Arms with a Cannon-Shot at the Bat|tle of <HI>Raab;</HI> I know how well thou merite&s;t from the Grand Seignior, who knowing very well thy worth, has made thee In&s;pector of
<PB N="180" REF="199">
that Body, which is the Strength and Defence of the Empire.</P>
<P>But as I flatter thee not at any time, &s;o much le&s;s can I withhold giving thee the needful In&s;tructions which my Di&s;tance, in this Place, furni&s;hes me with for the publick Good.</P>
<P>In a Word, faithful Servant of the Grand Seignior, you mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the Ex|cellence of your pre&s;ent Methods for di&s;cipli|ning and exerci&s;ing the Janizaries, I &s;ay, you mu&s;t be content to vary as well the Exerci&s;e as the Weapons to which they are exerci&s;ed; &s;o that as they excel all the Nations of Infidels in Prowe&s;s and Valour, they may not be de|ficient in Knowledge and Experience, and may be furni&s;hed with all tho&s;e Additions and Helps to the valiant Hearts they are Ma&s;ters of, as may be &s;ufficient to continue them in the Reputation which they have &s;o long en|joyed of being the be&s;t Troops in the World.</P>
<P>I need not argue with thee the Nece&s;&s;ity and U&s;efulne&s;s of Art in the well di&s;ciplining of Soldiers; why do we put Weapons into their Hands? why do we call the War a Trade, an Art? why are the Courages of Men lifted up to a due Pitch by enuring them to Action? and why do we form Troops into regular Bo|dies, that they may &s;upport, &s;uccour, and en|courage one another in Fight? but becau&s;e all Ways and Methods are to be &s;tudied, which may add to the Terror of our Arms, and make our Men &s;uperior to their Enemies in warlike Experience, as well as in Number and Courage.</P>
<P>As Weapons are put into the Hands of Men to defend them&s;elves, and offend their Ene|mies; &s;o all thy Predece&s;&s;ors, in the <HI>Oda</HI>'s of
<PB N="181" REF="200">
the Janizaries, have thought fit to alter and change tho&s;e Weapons, after the Manner of other Nations, that they might find no Di&s;ad|vantage in the Field again&s;t their Enemies; but might be always equally armed, and e|qually exerci&s;ed in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Arms, as the other Nations with whom they are to en|gage.</P>
<P>That this has been the U&s;age, I refer thee to the Rules of Di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Seraglio, confirmed in the Divan, in the Days of <HI>Selym U&s;&s;an Cherger,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, Aga of the Jani|zaries, in the Time of <HI>Amurath</HI> the fir&s;t, the glorious Conqueror of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Enemies; un|der who&s;e Reign the Janizaries were fir&s;t taught the U&s;e of the Harquebu&s;s or Gun, and began to throw away their Javelines, and Bows and Arrows; where thou wilt find it &s;aid, that whereas the Chri&s;tians made u&s;e of certain Engines, contrived to ca&s;t with great Force leaden Bullets point blank, which they brought into the Ranks, making thereby great Slaughter of their Enemies, that therefore it was agreeable to the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to repel Force with the like Force; and that thence forward Powder &s;hould be made, &s;ome (ren|egade <HI>Jews</HI>) having brought with them the Art of making it, and al&s;o the U&s;e of tho&s;e En|gines for Shooting Bullets, called Harquebu&s;|&s;es; and that for the Time to come, certain Numbers of the Janizaries, of the mo&s;t able Bodies, &s;hould be armed therewith, to annoy the In fidels in the &s;ame manner as they in|tended to annoy others.</P>
<P>Sage In&s;tructor of the valiant Youths, the Flower and Pillar of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Glory, thou wilt learn from me, that the U&s;e of Arms, the Exerci&s;e, the additional Weapons, are not only
<PB N="182" REF="201">
many, which they u&s;e now in fight; but the manner of u&s;ing them varies very much, and the <HI>French</HI> are in this &s;o dextrous, that they are, at this Time, the Teachers of their Enemies; and all the <HI>Nazareens</HI> borrow from them, not only the Way of fighting, encamping, forti|fying, attacking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but even the Terms, the Language of the Field is all <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Think it not a u&s;ele&s;s Caution that I ad|moni&s;h thee, think it not below thee to learn all the Improvements of the Art of War from Infidels and Enemies; I'll tell thee wherein they can learn from thee, they are not want|ing; every Step of thy excellent Di&s;cipline, which they find u&s;eful, they add to their own.</P>
<P>Particularly as thou ha&s;t long ago taught the Janizaries to throw away that u&s;ele&s;s, cumber|&s;ome Weapon the Pike, and in&s;tead thereof to make all thy Soldiers able to fight offen&s;ively, the <HI>French</HI> are taking the hint from thee; and all the old Regiments are made now, <HI>as they call them here,</HI> Fuzileers, having no U&s;e of the Pike among them; and this will no doubt be|come a Practice through all the Armies of the <HI>Nazareens.</HI></P>
<P>But it &s;hall remain upon Record, to thy Prai&s;e, that this Cu&s;tom was taken fir&s;t from thee, and that thereby the Janizaries have been rendered the more terrible in fight for &s;ome Years; particularly at the Defence of the Town of <HI>Buda,</HI> and at the Battle of <HI>Ni&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>Now as they received this hint from thee, O Man of martial Experience, be content to take back, in Exchange, the Improvement they make here of arming their Mu&s;queteers with a Hanjarr or Dagger, which they call here a Bayonet, which, in Ca&s;e of a clo&s;e Engagement
<PB N="183" REF="202">
with the Enemy, and particularly with the Hor&s;e, they place on the Muzzle of their Fire-Arms, and pre&s;enting the Point to the Enemy, repul&s;e thereby the mo&s;t fierce At|tacks of the Cavalry as well as of the Infantry.</P>
<P>So that by this Method of fighting, the an|cient way of clubbing the Mu&s;quet, and &s;tri|king with the Stock or But-End of their Pieces, is al&s;o quite laid a&s;ide; the Point of the Bay|onet being pre&s;ented with double Force, at the End of the Mu&s;quet, being a much more terrible way of charging, and doing much more Execution than the Stock of the Mu&s;quet.</P>
<P>Take this hint from me, founded upon an old Maxim among the Men of the Sword here.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. To <HI>Mehemet A&s;dan Cupriogli,</HI> victo|rious Conqueror of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> Re&s;torer of Glory to the Faithful, the right Hand of Honour, the Star of Prai&s;e, mighty Supporter of the tremendous Throne of the invincible Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> on who&s;e Head be eternal Benediction.</HEAD>
<P>TO whom but to thee, enur'd to Glory and great Actions, &s;hould I &s;end an Account of the glorious Progre&s;s of Arms on this Side the World, and the Conque&s;t of a City impregnable in its Scituation, made more &s;o by Art; and in a Word, &s;till made terri|ble by a numerous Garri&s;on of re&s;olute and experienced Soldiers.</P>
<P>In a Word, while the potent Confederacy of the <HI>Germans, Dutch, Engli&s;h, Scots, Iri&s;h,</HI> and all the Powers of the <HI>Northern</HI> World, were drawing together, to fall upon the King of <HI>France,</HI> as if they re&s;olved to fini&s;h the War in one Campaign, and that no humane Power was able to with&s;tand them.</P>
<P>While their numerous Troops were reckon'd up, and the on-looking World was, as it were, amaz'd at the very Thoughts of what would be done by &s;uch a collected Power, led on by &s;uch a martial Prince as the new King of
<PB N="185" REF="204">
<HI>England;</HI> or rather, as we call him here, Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>While all Eyes were turned upon the Coun|cils of <HI>France,</HI> and every one wondred what cour&s;e the King would take, and what Di&s;po|&s;itions of his Troops he would make, to oppo&s;e &s;uch prodigious Forces as &s;eemed to threat|en his Dominions.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, while things were in this Po&s;ture, we &s;ee all the World under &s;ome kind of Con|&s;ternation except the King of <HI>France;</HI> but of him it might be truly &s;aid, that he alone made all the&s;e terrible things his Sport; &s;miles continually, covered his Face, and he was ever gay; he &s;pent the Day among the fair ones, and diverted him&s;elf with Balls, Opera's, Fea&s;ts, and Shews, as if the whole Kingdom had been in profound Peace.</P>
<P>Now and then, and as if it had been for his Diver&s;ions only, he would &s;teal away to his Divan, or Chamber of Privy Coun&s;ellors, where he would &s;tay &s;o little, as to be hardly mi&s;s'd, and return as unconcerned as one who was only born for Delight, and &s;wallowed up in Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>When, on a &s;udden, without the lea&s;t Noi&s;e or Di&s;order, News came to <HI>Paris,</HI> for we knew nothing of it before, that <HI>Namure,</HI> the &s;trong|e&s;t Town in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was inve&s;ted by Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> and that the Troops were all in full March from the Frontier Garri&s;ons to form the Siege.</P>
<P>Nor was this all; but in two or three Days more we found the King's Field-Equipage pre|paring, and were told that his Maje&s;ty re&s;ol|ved to command the Siege in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe to thee what hurry and Confu&s;ion this real <HI>Coup de Eclat</HI> has
<PB N="186" REF="205">
put the World into: The Confederates drew together their Forces in &s;uch Numbers, and with &s;uch A&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s, that People be|gan to be very apprehen&s;ive of the Succe&s;s of the Enterprize, only the King and the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> pur&s;ue &s;teddily the Mea&s;ures they have taken, and depend upon the Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>As the Confederates talk of having an Hun|dred Thou&s;and Men to rai&s;e the Siege, the King re&s;olved to have as many to cover the Siege, be&s;ides a &s;ufficient Force to carry it on.</P>
<P>The King having re&s;olved to be there in Per&s;on, all the Hou&s;hold Troops were ordered to march, the <HI>Gens de Arms,</HI> the Light Hor&s;e, the Guards <HI>de Corps;</HI> all went away before, and the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded with 125 Thou&s;and Men before the King came, who brought with him about 15000 Men more.</P>
<P>The &s;iege, in the mean time, was carried on with &s;uch Vigor, that the City &s;urrendred upon Articles in le&s;s than 12 Days; the Batteries, con|&s;i&s;ting of 160 Pieces of Cannon and 60 Mor|tars, made &s;uch terrible Work, and the <HI>French</HI> followed their Work &s;o clo&s;e with Attack upon Attack, Storm upon Storm, even from Morn|ing to Night, that nothing could with&s;tand them.</P>
<P>Upon the City having &s;urrendred, the <HI>French</HI> had this Advantage, that their Lines took up le&s;s Circumference; the Ca&s;tle and a &s;trong Fort, which was lately built, took up an An|gle, form'd by two Rivers, the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Sambre;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> had nothing to do but to extend their Works from one River to the other, exactly as the City of <HI>Belgrade</HI> is &s;ci|tuate in the Angle between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Sauve.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="206">
The Ca&s;tle and Fort made a &s;tout Re&s;i&s;tance, the latter being defended by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cohorn,</HI> the Engineer, who contrived and built it, and after who&s;e Name it was called the <HI>Cohorn</HI> Fort; this Man is no le&s;s a Soldier than an Engineer, and is one of the be&s;t Officers in this Part of the World, both for Experience in Conduct, as well as Courage in Action.</P>
<P>The Vigour of this Defence gave the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> Time to collect his Troops, and be|ing as good as his Word, he approach'd the Leaguer with an Army of no le&s;s than Ninety Five Thou&s;and Men, and which was &s;till more, the&s;e Troops were thought to be all old experienc'd Regiments, the Flower of the mi|litary Men in this Part of the World.</P>
<P>Yet in Sight of this Army, and as if they were come only to be Witne&s;&s;es to the Glo|ry of the <HI>French</HI> Power, the King of <HI>France</HI> carried the Place; the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> covered the Siege with an Army at lea&s;t equal to that of the Confederates; but po&s;ted &s;o, with a River in his Front, to Advantage; en|trenched all the Avenues to his Camp, and fortified in &s;uch a Manner, and tho&s;e Trenches mounted with &s;uch an innumerable Number of Cannon, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to attack him, or &s;o much as to pa&s;s the River, tho' it was but a &s;mall one, to approach his Entrenchments.</P>
<P>It is true, the Confederates made &s;everal Mo|tions this Way, and that, to draw him out of that Scituation, but it would not do; and the River &s;welling at the &s;ame time, with a ha&s;ty Rain, gave them &s;ome Excu&s;e for not attempt|ing what they &s;aw could not be done with|out hazarding the Ruin of their whole Ar|my.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="207">
In the mean time, the King pu&s;hing on the Attacks again&s;t the Place, the Works were continually &s;torm'd Day and Night; the Garri&s;on was plied with ince&s;&s;ant Batteries and A&s;&s;aults; &s;o that all the Outworks being won, the Garri&s;on was obliged to capitulate, after having lo&s;t above 7000 Men of their Number in the Siege.</P>
<P>The Reputation this has given to the <HI>French</HI> Arms, the Vigour it has put into their Mea|&s;ures and Councils, at a Time when all <HI>Europe</HI> expected they would have been oppre&s;s'd with the Power of &s;o many Enemies, is not to be expre&s;s'd; nor is it to be equall'd by any thing in the World but thy glorious Enterprizes in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> where thou ha&s;t retriev'd the Honour of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Arms, and curb'd the In&s;olence of the Enemies of thy Ma&s;ter's Glory, in a manner &s;urprizing to the whole World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. To the Aga of the Janizaries.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Nazareens,</HI> the ancient Enemies of God and his great Prophet, who&s;e Cham|pion thou art, are univer&s;ally involv'd in War: The <HI>German</HI> Emperor, Head of the Princes of the People believing in Je&s;us, and of the Followers of the Me&s;&s;iah, is engaged in a bloody and heavy War again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' his Power is great, his Troops nume|rous, and well di&s;ciplin'd, and his Generals are Men of Gallantry and Experience, yet the Vigilance and Velocity of the <HI>French</HI> Motions, their &s;ubtilty in contriving their Attacks, and Celerity in Execution of their De&s;igns are &s;uch, that the <HI>Germans</HI> are every where wor&s;ted and defeated.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> is devoured in Imagi|nation; but he always extricates him&s;elf by the admirable Vivacity of his Councils, and the Vigour of his Generals; he conquers on every Hand, and his turning the Schemes of his Adver&s;aries all upon them&s;elves, by being before them in every Action, is the A&s;toni&s;h|ment of Mankind.</P>
<P>The Nothern Powers have placed, at the Head of their Confederacy, a Prince politick in Council, as <HI>Tomombcius</HI> the <HI>Mamuluck;</HI> furi|ous in Battle as <HI>Scanderbeg</HI> the <HI>Epirot;</HI> warlike in Genius as <HI>I&s;urael</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> but as all the&s;e were unfortunate, and their Powers at la&s;t fell under the irre&s;i&s;tible Hand of the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="209">
Power; &s;o the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is made glo|rious, only by being defeated; and the Great|ne&s;s of his Soul &s;eems rather illu&s;trated by his equal Mind under his Misfortunes, than by the Laurels and Triumphs of Victory.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year, he had the Honour of &s;eeing the King of <HI>France</HI> take the &s;tronge&s;t Fortre&s;s on the Frontiers of the <HI>Ne|therlands,</HI> while he look'd on, at the Head of a Hundred Thou&s;and Men, but was not able to relieve it; and now he has had the Mis|fortune of attacking the <HI>French</HI> Army at a Vil|lage called <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> but has been beaten off with the Lo&s;s of above 5000 Men, and &s;ome of his be&s;t Generals, and has taken the Pains to bring the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> a Victory to the very Lines of his Camp.</P>
<P>In <HI>Germany,</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI> gains every Campaign; and this Year he has plundered the Frontiers of the Empire, and in View of a &s;uperiour Army, forced the <HI>Germans</HI> to repa&s;s the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and at la&s;t, tho' he refu&s;ed to fight their whole Army, has defeated a Body of 4000 Hor&s;e, which he &s;urprized at a Di&s;tance from their grand Army, and cut them in Pieces al|mo&s;t to a Man.</P>
<P>Thus this invincible Monarch, tho' he &s;truggles with innumerable Difficulties at home, and tho' he has mo&s;t powerful Ene|mies abroad, even on every Side of him, tri|umphs in their Di&s;appointment, and will, in Time, mo&s;t certainly reduce them all, one after another, if &s;ome unexpected Blow does not intervene to di&s;able him at once; and e|ven this there &s;eems to be no Danger of, where the Power is &s;o great, and the Prince &s;o vigi|lant, that it &s;eems next to impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ur|prize him.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="210">
The Fortune of this Man puts me in Mind of <HI>Saladin,</HI> the famous Prince of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> or of their Succe&s;&s;ors the <HI>Saracens,</HI> who when over-power'd and &s;urrounded with innumera|ble Armies of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> who blind Zeal in&s;pired to make War upon the true Mu&s;&s;el|men, on pretence of recovering the Sepulchre of Je&s;us, the Son of <HI>Mary;</HI> this Prince, by his Vigilance and Valour, accompanied with a never wearied Application, at length conquer|ed them all, and &s;ent them home to in&s;truct their Po&s;terity, how fooli&s;h an Enterprize their Fathers &s;pent their Blood and Trea&s;ure upon, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to look for the Sepulchre of him, who was taken up into Heaven.</P>
<P>So may the Arms of the invincible Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> thy glorious Ma&s;ter, pro&s;per in thy Hands, till the <HI>Germans,</HI> and other Nations of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> who have &s;o long in vain lifted up the Sword again&s;t him, may &s;ee and repent of their Folly, and admoni&s;h their Po&s;terity to avoid &s;plitting on the &s;ame Rock.</P>
<P>Valiant Aga, wherefore is it that the Expe|rience and Valour of the Janizaries has not yet convinc'd the grand Vizier of the U&s;efulne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up a larger Body of tho&s;e gallant Troops, &s;uitable to the Greatne&s;s and Extent of the Dominions of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and proportioned to the growing Power of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> who, by their Advantages over the true Believers, are grown more powerful and more in&s;olent than ever.</P>
<P>Why are not the Oda's of the Janizaries en|crea&s;ed in every Beglerbeg or Government? nay, why are not all the Soldiers of the Grand Seignior made Janizaries, <HI>(viz.)</HI> taught Di&s;ci|pline, enured to Hard&s;hips, in&s;tructed in due
<PB N="192" REF="211">
Subordination to their Officers, and, in a Word, made good Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Courage, the Gallantry in Spirit, the Strength and Agility of Body with which our People are endowed, far exceeds the Nations they are engaged with; what are the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Italians,</HI> the <HI>Hungarians?</HI> they have neither the Con&s;tancy of Mind, or Strength of Body, as the <HI>Bulgarian, Thracian, Georgian,</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Janizaries; the <HI>French</HI> common Soldiers are low and de&s;picable, their Limbs weak, their Sub&s;i&s;tence mean, their Intemperance weakens and debilitates them, and they &s;eem capable of no Service; yet we &s;ee them often, by the ex|cellent Conduct of their Officers, and their own being enured to the War; I &s;ay, we &s;ee them often break the undi&s;ciplined Nations of other Countries; nay, even of the <HI>Germans</HI> them&s;elves, by their dextrous U&s;e of their Arms, and the Fire of their martial Di&s;po&s;iti|on.</P>
<P>Were the Subjects of the Grand Seignior thus bred to the Field, were they daily and duly exerci&s;ed, as the Janizaries, we know the martial Genius, the undaunted Spirit, the Con&s;tancy and Courage of the faithful Mu&s;|&s;elmen is &s;uch, that they would cut the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> in pieces; the be&s;t Troops of the&s;e In|fidel Nations could not &s;tand before them; if this is not done, take <HI>Mahmut</HI>'s Word, the Art of War is &s;o much improved, the Me|thods of fighting &s;o altered, and the Engins and the Devices of the Generals &s;o differing from what it was in our Forefathers Days, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for any of the Grand Seignior's Troops, but the Janizaries and Spa|his, to &s;tand their Ground again&s;t their Ene|mies; their Number mu&s;t be encrea&s;ed, and

they mu&s;t be encouraged, equal to their De|&s;erts, and then the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Arms &s;hall tri|umph, as they have always done, over Infidel Nations to the Day when the great Gates of <HI>Eden</HI> &s;hall be opened, and the Faithful &s;hall, with Swords of Flame, de&s;troy the Enemies of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. To the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Jani&s;aries.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was thought, in the Beginning of this Year, that the King of <HI>France</HI>'s good Fortune began to leave him, things went exceeding hard with him on every Side; for tho' he had taken the u&s;ual Advantages of the Spring, by being early in the Field, as was al|ways the Cu&s;tom of <HI>France,</HI> and by which they u&s;ed to have the better Hand of the Confede|rates, and had thereby taken <HI>Namure,</HI> as I have written already to the Grand Vizier, yet the Con|federate-Army harra&s;s'd the <HI>French</HI> Frontiers in <HI>Flanders</HI> extremely after this, and attack'd their whole Army in their Camp, tho' without Succe&s;s in the End.</P>
<P>Two Blows have &s;ince that befallen <HI>France,</HI> which are as two Stabs into the Vitals of a Body, which before was &s;truggling for Life;
<PB N="194" REF="213">
and it was thought, had they been followed home, the Glory of the King of <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t have expired; the&s;e were the Overthrow of their Fleet by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the penetrating into the Bowels of <HI>France,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> at the Head of 40000 Men, where he committed mo&s;t dreadful Ravages, and burnt above a Hundred Towns, of both which I have written fully to the Kaimacham, who will doubtle&s;s communicate the Particu|lars to thee.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Nation were &s;o humbled by the&s;e two fatal Stroaks coming together, to neither of which they were in a Condition to apply any immediate Remedy, and e&s;pecially being at the &s;ame Time threatened with a powerful Inva&s;ion or De&s;cent of an Army from <HI>England,</HI> that they fell to what they call here the la&s;t Remedy, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Prayers to their Me&s;&s;iah; to this End a general Day of <HI>Biram,</HI> was proclaim|ed by the great Mufti of <HI>Paris,</HI> throughout his Di&s;tricts, and &s;o by the other pontifical Muf|ti's, in their re&s;pective Dominations, with &s;trict Orders that all the People &s;hould apply them|&s;elves to their Devotions, and to call upon their God, in the Name of the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> to deliver them.</P>
<P>Whether it were that the Sins of the other <HI>Nazareen</HI> Nations were &s;o great, that Heaven did not think &s;it to cha&s;ti&s;e <HI>France</HI> by their Hands; or whether their Prophet JESUS, to whom the <HI>French</HI> were &s;aid they put up their Petitions, did obtain Help for them, I do not well know how to re&s;olve; for the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have &s;o many Interce&s;&s;ors, that it is hard to re&s;olve who they will thank for their Deliverance, or who they will ac|knowledge to have procured it; for &s;ome pray
<PB N="195" REF="214">
to God alone, others to Je&s;us, and &s;ome to his Mother; &s;ome to this old Hermit, &s;ome to another; &s;o that it is certain there are al|mo&s;t as many Idols as Wor&s;hipers.</P>
<P>However it was, this is certain, that the whole Stream of Succe&s;&s;es &s;eems to be turn|ed on a &s;udden; and the Attempts of the Ene|mies of <HI>France,</HI> however probable, and how|ever powerful, have mi&s;carried on every Side, and the King of <HI>France</HI> is in a fair way to conclude the Year with a general Triumph over his Enemies.</P>
<P>In Truth, O thou fortunate Leader of the &s;elect Bands of the Faithful, the Sword in the Hands of the Soldier is never in vain lifted up, when the Eyes of tho&s;e who fight are fir&s;t lifted up to Heaven; for whether God hears the&s;e Infidels or not, in re&s;pect to their wrong and ill directed Wor&s;hip, yet he may give Ear to all his Creatures, when they lift their Hands to him for Help again&s;t their Enemies, and deliver them, that they may de directed to &s;eek the right way of apply|ing them&s;elves on farther Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Hence it was, without doubt, that the more pure Prayers of the faithful Mu&s;&s;ulmen, in their great Pilgrimage or Proce&s;&s;ion to <HI>Mecca,</HI> the Year before the la&s;t, obtained the future Favour of our great Prophet, who &s;trength|ened the Arms, and &s;harpened the Scymaters of the Janizaries, to hew down the Enemies of the Grand Seignior.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts well with the Notions we enter|tain of the great <HI>Alla,</HI> who guides the Affairs of Men, whether private and per&s;onal, or na|tional; that he &s;ometimes hears even the Ca|lamities of infidel Nations, and turns the Scale of his Providence as they turn their
<PB N="196" REF="215">
Eyes upwards, tho' otherwi&s;e they may be impious Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of his Law; for Heaven never can be &s;aid to &s;tand neuter in the Con|cerns of War and Peace between Nations, tho' the contending Parties may be equally In|fidels and Enemies to God; but he delivers here, and delivers up there, as it be&s;t an&s;wers the great Ends of his Glory in the Earth.</P>
<P>How much more then &s;hall he hear the Prayers of his faithful People, who choo&s;e the right Way? and what Courage mu&s;t this give to the Hands and Hearts of thy immortal Soldiers, when they know the whole Choir of Believers five Times a Day make Prayers for their vi|ctorious Progre&s;s in the Field.</P>
<P>But to do the King of <HI>France</HI> Ju&s;tice; after all this, he took care to pray and fight, whe|ther it was that he had le&s;s Confidence in the Prie&s;t, than in the Sword, I will not deter|mine; but he applied him&s;elf with infinite Vigilance to every Attack that was made up|on him, and his Troops brought him unex|pected Victories from &s;everal Quarters.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time Heaven concurr'd, and Two things more e&s;pecially &s;eemed to be the immediate Act of a &s;upernatural Power; for Example; the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> in the Middle of his Succe&s;s, when he was entered the very Heart of the <HI>Dauphinate,</HI> and promi&s;ed to him&s;elf the Plunder of the Cities of <HI>Briancon</HI> and <HI>Grenoble;</HI> nay, as &s;ome &s;aid, expected to pa&s;s the <HI>Rho&s;ne,</HI> and penetrate into <HI>Languedoc;</HI> in the Middle of all this Triumph, the Duke, who was the Soul of the Enterprize, was &s;truck from Hea|ven with a loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, which they call here <HI>les Petits Veroles,</HI> a Di&s;temper not known in the happy Climate of <HI>Arabia,</HI> where thou and I drew our &s;erener Breath.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="216">
They tell us a Story here, and boa&s;t much of it, tho' I tell thee beforehand I believe not one Word of it; that the very Moment that the King of <HI>France</HI> was on his Knees in the Royal Chappel or Mo&s;que of his Serail, or Pa|lace at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> praying to the image of <HI>Ma|ry,</HI> the Mother of their Prophet Je&s;us, &s;he &s;truck the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> with the Small-Pox. If this were true, the <HI>French</HI> would have much more Rea&s;on to wor&s;hip that old Woman, than any of us believe they have.</P>
<P>But to leave the&s;e <HI>Nazareens</HI> to their Super|&s;titions, certain it is, the Duke was taken &s;o ill, and was brought into &s;o much Danger of his Life by this Di&s;temper, that it put a full Stop to all his Conque&s;ts, and the Troops retired in the be&s;t manner they could; quitted all the Places they had taken, broke down the Bridges behind them, and rather fled, than march'd quite out of <HI>France,</HI> and that fa&s;ter than they came in, and yet the <HI>French</HI> Army was not in any Po&s;ture to precipitate them at all, neither did any one pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>Whether the King of <HI>France</HI> will acknow|ledge this to be the Hand of God, or of the Woman <HI>Mary,</HI> I know not; but this I know, that if he takes the Honour from the Hand that has really &s;av'd him in &s;o remarkable a Manner, and pays the Acknowledgment of it to the Image of that Woman, it would be very righteous in the great Retalliator of ju&s;t Sentences, to make the &s;ame Hand of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;courge him into a more rightly directed De|votion.</P>
<P>But he has bad another Deliverance al&s;o immediately from Heaven; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, who were not only appointed, but actually &s;hipp'd and &s;ail'd, in order to make
<PB N="198" REF="217">
a De&s;cent upon the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> and which it was apparent the <HI>French</HI> were in great Apprehen&s;ions of, becau&s;e they knew not where to look for them, or provide again&s;t them, are returned and relanded in <HI>England,</HI> having gi|ven over the De&s;ign, without its being po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee any apparent Rea&s;on for their doing &s;o.</P>
<P>Being thus at once delivered from the&s;e two great and threatning Articles, they were not only ea&s;ie, but at lei&s;ure to apply proper Re|medies to the other Parts where they were weake&s;t; and fir&s;t, the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> ha|ving been attack'd by the King of <HI>England,</HI> at <HI>Steenkirk</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he repul&s;t him, after a very ob&s;tinate Fight, with the Lo&s;s of near 8000 Men kill'd, wounded, and taken Pri&s;on|ers; and believing him&s;elf, by this Victory, able to &s;tand his Ground with fewer Troops than before, great Detatchments have been made to the <HI>Rh&iuml;ne,</HI> and to <HI>Piedmont;</HI> of which I &s;hall give thee a full Account in my next.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trious Aga, as the&s;e bloody Wars de|&s;troy Multitudes of Men, and the <HI>Nazareens</HI> are thus cutting one another in pieces; let thy victorious En&s;igns cheerfully advance, &s;e|cure of Conque&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Prayers of our great Prophet, and thy unwearied Valour and Council.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. To the venerable Mufti, &s;age Mirror of cele&s;tial Wi&s;dom, the inlighten'd Prince of the Oracles of Virtue, Guide of the true Believers to the Glories of Paradi&s;e, and Keeper of the Garden of Plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>VERILY, the Affairs of Religion in the&s;e Parts of the World tend appa|rently to the forgetting entirely that there is a Rule for Men on Earth, or a God to judge in Heaven; it would amaze thee, venerable and wi&s;e Patron of Piety, it would amaze thee, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> to &s;ee how that Bawble called Re|ligion, is kick'd about here, even among the Men pretending to Learning, Under&s;tanding, and the Height of humane Knowledge, till it grows into Contempt, and will in a little Time be entirely lo&s;t; nay, perhaps it may be no more remembred, no, not &s;o much as the Name of it.</P>
<P>It is true, there is &s;o much Gain made here by the Shew of it, that, for ought I know, the Formalities of Religion may continue &s;ome time, at lea&s;t till the Pride, Luxury, and Lewd|ne&s;s of the Clergy provoke the common Peo|ple to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice upon the Prie&s;ts, which will certainly happen the fir&s;t Occa&s;i|on the Mob have to get &s;o much Power into their Hands; and then, as the Sub&s;tance of
<PB N="200" REF="219">
Religion never was among them, the Shadow will wear off with &s;mall Difficulty.</P>
<P>Here was a Book publi&s;h'd a few Months ago by a Man who does not want Wit, en|tituled, <HI>The Vanity of Religion, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Di&s;gui&s;e of it being thrown off:</HI> He would in|&s;inuate, that &s;eeing the wicked Lives of the Clergy or Dervices, makes it manife&s;t to the World that there is no &s;uch thing as Religi|on, really and at the Bottom of all their Schemes; but that it is a meer Grimace, and a Piece of Hy|pocri&s;ie, to get Money and Dominion one over another; that therefore Men ought to deliver them&s;elves from the in&s;upportable Weight of the Di&s;gui&s;e of Religion, and make no farther Pretences to it in the World.</P>
<P>Some People take this to be a Satyr only, and pointed at the Hypocri&s;ie and Cheats of the Clergy, who, under the Colour of religi|ous Habits and Orders, are the Protectors and Encouragers of all &s;orts of Wickedne&s;s; but we, as true Mu&s;&s;ulmen, join in the litteral Sen&s;e of the Words, and believe they ought to throw off all the Di&s;gui&s;e, own the Cheat, and pretend no more to any thing of that which they call Religion here, embracing at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t pure and perfect Rules of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s from the Mouth of undi&s;gui&s;ed Truth, owning and adhering to the everla&s;t|ing Oracle, and the Law of the great Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Some time &s;ince, I heard that the great Mufti of the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> the Prince of Delu&s;ions, and Patron of apo&s;tate My&s;teries, who calls him&s;elf the Head of the Followers of Je&s;us the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> the infallible Guide of the Law, and Interpreter of the Faith and Do|ctrine
<PB N="201" REF="220">
of the Chri&s;tians, was at the Point of Death.</P>
<P>Upon this News, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe to thee what running and po&s;ting, what intreaguing and caballing there was among the Princes and Courts in this Part of the World, to make an Intere&s;t for a new Election; <HI>France</HI> is particularly concerned, if po&s;&s;ible, to have a new Pope elected out of the Number of Car|dinals, who are in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and Couriers are di&s;patch'd to all the Cardinals that are &s;o, to &s;et out immediately for <HI>Rome,</HI> to be pre&s;ent at the new Election, and take Care of the main Point in the Conclave. It is worthy of thy &s;elf, &s;ublime Judge of venera|ble Truth, to &s;earch into the Policies of tho&s;e People, and to have an Account of this Ele|ction faithfully laid before thee; I &s;hall take care to obtain as many Particulars as may be depended upon, and lay them at thy &s;acred Feet as they go on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I ob&s;erve no Grief for the Lo&s;s of him that is going: Of what Im|port, &s;ay they, is the Death of an old Man; the Regard to the Per&s;on of the late Pope is all &s;wallowed up in the politick Bu&s;tle they make for a new Election, and in this Part <HI>Spain</HI> and the Emperor are the particular Oppo&s;ers of the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This dead Pope has &s;at in the Chair of the Pontiff but fifteen Months, and is no le&s;s than Eighty one Years of Age. I call him dead, be|cau&s;e &s;oon after an Expre&s;s arrived with an Account of his Death, the Particulars I have of it, as publi&s;hed here by the Court, are thus:</P>
<P>He had been indi&s;po&s;ed for four or five Days, and having Rea&s;on, on Account of his great Age, to expect the fir&s;t Shock would
<PB N="202" REF="221">
carry him off, he di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elf for his Exit; he di&s;cours'd much the 29<HI>th</HI> of the Moon called <HI>January</HI> to the Cardinals, con|cerning the &s;everal Intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and his Endeavours to prevent the growing Mi&s;chiefs of the War, which however he &s;aw was im|po&s;&s;ible: He pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Bulls, and declared again&s;t &s;ome Encroachments of the King of <HI>France</HI> upon the Church.</P>
<P>The 30<HI>th,</HI> he found him&s;elf very ill, and the 31<HI>&s;t</HI> much wor&s;e, and his End drawing on, which obliged the Cardinals, and more e&s;pecially his Favourites, to keep near his Per|&s;on; next Morning, being &s;omewhat better, he received the &s;acred Oil, as they call it, and the re&s;t of the Seals of their Religion, and di&s;cour&s;ed a long Time with Cardinal <HI>Colorede</HI> his Confe&s;&s;or, and other Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, upon Matters of Piety: After which, the Cardinals being brought to his Bed, one after another, he recommended it earne&s;tly to their Care to ca&s;t their Eyes, in the next Conclave, upon a worthy Per&s;on to fill St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Chair, more e&s;pecially con&s;idering the Con&s;equence of the Election at &s;uch a Juncture of the Affairs of <HI>Europe;</HI> he expired the Night of the &s;ame Day about Four of the Clock in the Morning, aged four&s;core and one Years, after he had &s;at fifteen Months and twenty two Days, being elected the 16<HI>th</HI> of the Moon which they call <HI>October,</HI> 1689.</P>
<P>The Meeting of the Conclave, their man|ner of electing, the Rules of their &s;trict, or rather mock Confinement, during the Time of their electing, this thou art fully acquainted with, and I have no need to trouble thee with Repetitions.</P>
<P>It is not yet known who &s;hall &s;ucceed in the Pontificate of Idolaters, neither is it of
<PB N="203" REF="222">
much Con&s;equence; for tho' the Popes them|&s;elves labour very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to make them|&s;elves con&s;iderable to the Princes of <HI>Europe;</HI> yet the Princes, on the other Hand, oftentimes take occa&s;ion to mortifie the Popes, and to let them &s;ee the In&s;ignificancy of their Pow|er, when it comes in competition with tem|poral Intere&s;t; I &s;ay, this makes the whole Sy|&s;tem of the Papacy a meer Piece of political Pageantry, carried on to &s;upport the Pride and Luxury of the Clergy, and which is in it &s;elf nothing at all but a Bubble of Air and Emptine&s;s when it comes to be tried with its Superiors, the &s;ecular Powers of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Conclave is met, and the la&s;t Pope has left it full, which has not been known in the Memory of Man. This Pope was a Per&s;on of the lea&s;t Signification of any that has &s;at in this Chair of Abomination for many Ages, and can only have this &s;aid in his Favour, that he has done neither Good nor Harm; he has left little but his Name to put Po&s;terity in mind that ever he was here. He was &s;uperannuated when he came in, and after a Stay only of One Year and three Moons, left the Chair of the old Fi|&s;herman ju&s;t where he found it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. To <HI>Ali,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, Chief of the Engineers, and Seraskeir of the <HI>Morea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Cannot have a fairer Occa&s;ion to give thee an Account of &s;omething in thine own Way, than what offers ju&s;t now among the <HI>Nazareens.</HI> The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Montmelian</HI> is a For|tre&s;s in the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> which for ma|ny Ages has been thought impregnable, as well by the Difficulty of its Scituation, as the Ad|dition of all the Fortifications that Art could invent, or the be&s;t Engineers of this Country contrive, to render it perfectly inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is &s;eated upon a mon&s;trous Rock, ex|ceeding high, &s;teep, and inacce&s;&s;ible, except on one End, where it runs out long, narrow, and &s;loping down till it gradually comes le|vel to a little Plain, from whence they pa&s;s to a little River with a Bridge over it, called the <HI>I&s;era.</HI></P>
<P>This is the only Pa&s;&s;age into the Fort; but is &s;o taken up with Works innumerable, one above another, and one defending another, that it is not to be conceived how Art &s;hould find its Way, among &s;uch Oppo&s;ition, to work it &s;elf into the Town.</P>
<P>It is commanded by one Rock, which in|deed overlooks this Part; but there is no po&s;|&s;ible getting any Cannon up to that Rock, ex|cept by Pullies and Engines, and this mu&s;t be done in the Face of the Fire of the Forts on the Hill of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="224">
Yet this impregnable Fortre&s;s has been ta|ken by the <HI>French,</HI> after a long Blockade, in a few Days formal Siege, and that in the mo&s;t &s;evere Sea&s;on of the Year, when the Moun|tains, of which the whole Country is compo|&s;ed, were all covered with Snow, and the Cold &s;o &s;evere, that every one thought it in|&s;upportable.</P>
<P>This, however, &s;urprizes no Body here, whatever it may do in other Countries; for <HI>France</HI> has always his Men ready to take the Field, his Magazines and his Ar&s;enals are always well furni&s;hed, and he has &s;uch good Generals, and &s;uch a great Number of Offi|cers, that they make it a Point of Honour to expo&s;e their Lives when it is for the Glory of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy; be&s;ides, the Monarch him&s;elf little cares how he &s;acrifices his be&s;t Soldiers, and being ab&s;olute, exacts &s;uch va&s;t Sums from his Subjects, makes his Soldiers march all Sea&s;ons of the Year, and takes his Time and his Mea&s;ures &s;o exactly, that he may be &s;aid to play a &s;ure Game whenever he has a Mind to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of any Place.</P>
<P>Of this, they that have to deal with <HI>France</HI> ought to be &s;en&s;ible in good earne&s;t; for &s;o long as they are not vigilant, and upon their Guard, <HI>France</HI> will be always upon the Surprize with them; 'tis in vain to tru&s;t in the Scitu|ation of a Fortre&s;s, if there be not Men in a Condition to be &s;tirring at all times: There are no Places now a-days impregnable, un|le&s;s they be relieved in Time: The Fortre&s;&s;es that are the highe&s;t rai&s;ed, are no le&s;s &s;ubject to the De&s;truction of the Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es, than to the Strokes of thundering Cannon; &s;o that all that great Guns can tear down, mu&s;t yield at length to a Conqueror that re&s;olves
<PB N="206" REF="225">
to &s;pare neither Lives nor Limbs to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of a Place, e&s;pecially when unmole&s;ted from without; &s;ince Artillery came in u&s;e, there is nothing can re&s;i&s;t the Force of it, when the General that be&s;ieges has no Enemy to di&s;turb him behind: The En|gines now a-days made u&s;e of give the Be&s;ieged &s;o little Time to look about 'em, that ma|ny times they are taken when they think to make the &s;toute&s;t Defence; and therefore the &s;ure&s;t Way is always to have Men lie ready near tho&s;e Places which are mo&s;t in Danger, that in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity they may be able to form a Body &s;ufficient to encounter the Ene|my.</P>
<P>This Place was taken in two and thirty Days, principally by the Power of battering and mining; for there was not any one At|tack made of any Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The Be&s;ieged defended them&s;elves without much u&s;e of either great Shot or &s;mall Shot, and yet they kill'd the <HI>French</HI> a great many brave Men, and &s;ome con&s;iderable Officers; their chief Defence was countermining the Works of the A&s;&s;ailants, and rolling great Stones upon them from the Tops and A&s;cents of the Rocks, which coming &s;o furiou&s;ly, and receiving additional Strength to the Motion from the Heights from whence they were ca&s;t, were not to be re&s;i&s;ted, no not &s;o much as the Shot of great Guns might have been re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Garri&s;on plied them with this Sort of Battery ince&s;&s;antly; &s;o that no &s;coner had the A&s;&s;ailants rai&s;ed a Battery of Cannon, or any Work to cover or lodge their Men, but in one Night's Time it was overthrown, and as it were buried with Stones, and the va&s;t Quan|tity
<PB N="207" REF="226">
of Rubbi&s;h the Stones brought with them; &s;o that the Cannon were di&s;mounted, as it were, in a Moment, or perhaps broken, and the Carriages clogg'd &s;o as not to be &s;tir|red, Stones of two or three Ton coming down continually upon them from the Summits of an immen&s;e Mountain.</P>
<P>The Bombs, however, and Miners, redu|ced the Place, and a Bomb, by Accident, breaking into one of the Mines which the Garri&s;on them&s;elves had made to ruin the Approaches, blew up the great Ba&s;tion of the Place, at which Breach the <HI>French</HI> taking hold of the Occa&s;ion, Six hundred Men immediate|ly entered, and the Garri&s;on &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;urpri&s;ed, beat a Parly.</P>
<P>The Garri&s;on were but 300 Men, and it is ob&s;erved, that they were &s;o &s;ecured in the Re|treats, which they had in the Rock, from the Shot and Bombs, that tho' the <HI>French</HI> were not &s;paring of either one or other, yet they lo&s;t very few Men within the Place, I think le&s;s than 20, whereas the <HI>French</HI> lo&s;t above 1500 Men without, be&s;ides &s;uch as died by the Extremities of the Weather, which were a great many.</P>
<P>But that which is yet more &s;trange than all this is, that the King of <HI>France</HI> has given po|&s;itive Orders to have the Place entirely de|moli&s;hed, which &s;ome People think to be ve|ry ill Policy; but I am of Opinion, I con|fe&s;s, that the King is in the Right; for he concludes, that on a Peace, which he knew would &s;ometime or other happen, it mu&s;t be re&s;tored, and he is not willing it &s;hould co&s;t him 2000 Men again, if he &s;hould ever have an Occa&s;ion to lay another Siege to it; and as the Fortifications before were made by the
<PB N="208" REF="227">
<HI>French,</HI> he knows the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> cannot &s;pare &s;o much Money as it mu&s;t co&s;t, to re|&s;tore them to what they were before.</P>
<P>For thy farther Improvement in the Art of Fortifications and Attacks of Towns, and to acquaint thee with the noble Experiment daily made on the&s;e Occa&s;ions by this a&s;piring In|fidel Nation, I &s;hall &s;end thee &s;everal Plans and Drafts of the &s;everal Fortifications of the Places which have been attack'd by the <HI>French</HI> in this War; and likewi&s;e Plans of the Ap|proaches, Batteries, Circumvallations, and Con|travallations, for the Security of their Camps and Works, that thou maye&s;t extract from thence what&s;oever &s;hall be u&s;eful to thee in the Conque&s;ts the Grand Seignior's Armies &s;hall make upon the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>

<P>The Beginning of the Sea&s;on, the Campaign was opened with the Siege of <HI>Namure,</HI> a ter|rible Place for Strength, and yet taken in the View of an Hundred Thou&s;and Men, and headed by the greate&s;t and mo&s;t formidable Enemy the King of <HI>France</HI> has in the World, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the King of <HI>England,</HI> a Man who&s;e Cha|racter ri&s;es in the World like a new Star (in a Con&s;tellation) never di&s;covered before.</P>
<P>After this, the &s;ame King of <HI>England,</HI> with that great Army, warmly endeavoured to bring the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> to a Battle; but yet when he attempted to force him to it, by attacking him at <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> was repuls'd, and oblig'd to retreat with very great Lo&s;s of his be&s;t Men, &s;everal Generals of great Reputation have been kill'd in this Attempt, with abun|dance of Officers, and Six or Eight Thou&s;and Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Campaign on the <HI>Rhine</HI> &s;eemed to be going off without Action, but the Duke <HI>de Lorge,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> General, who commanded
<PB N="213" REF="232">
there, having received &s;ome Forces from <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> followed the <HI>Germans</HI> &s;o well, and ma|naged &s;o &s;ubtilly, that at length he trick'd them into a Separation, and then turning &s;hort upon one Half of them, before they could join again, fell upon that Part of their Army which march'd under the Duke of <HI>Wir|temberg</HI> towards <HI>Germany,</HI> defeated them entire|ly, cut 4000 of them in pieces, took 3000 Pri&s;oners, a great many Officers of Note, and among them the Duke him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After this, pur&s;uing the other Body, who were commanded by the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and had laid Siege to the &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Ebrenburgh;</HI> he obliged them to rai&s;e the Siege with great Precipitation, and in the mean Time Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lorge</HI> had ordered a Body of Troops to make the u&s;ual Havock of a Conqueror, in the Duke of <HI>Wirtemburg</HI>'s Coun|try, and the Circles adjacent, where, be&s;ides the Plunder they gain'd, which was prodigious great, they rai&s;ed &s;ome Millions of Money for Contribution.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> have receiv'd this Blow as a ju&s;t Return for their drawing &s;o many of their Troops from the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to fight again&s;t the faithful Mu&s;&s;ulmen in <HI>Hungaria;</HI> which they do, upon a Suppo&s;ition that the Princes of the Con|federacy would &s;upply them with other Troops in their &s;tead; how well they perform it, this is an Example: And I rather &s;end thee this Account, becau&s;e thou maye&s;t gather from it, that the Emperor of the <HI>Nazareens</HI> has already &s;ent for five <HI>German</HI> Regiments of Foot, and four Regiments of Hor&s;e from <HI>Hungary;</HI> the Foot making 12900 Men, and the Hor&s;e 4000, and thou maye&s;t depend that every Blow the Emperor receives upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> will be felt
<PB N="214" REF="233">
in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where the Troops of the Grand Seig|nior, on who&s;e Arms be the Lu&s;tre of Heaven, will have &s;o much the more Room to act with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> General, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Squadron of Men of War from <HI>Thoulon,</HI> has, in le&s;s than twelve Days, taken the &s;trong Town and Port of <HI>Ro&s;es;</HI> a Conque&s;t the more con&s;iderable, becau&s;e of its being the be&s;t Harbour for &s;hipping that the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> have upon the whole Continent of their Dominions in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The Method the Court of <HI>France</HI> takes when any Pri&s;oners of Quality fall into their Hands, is very &s;ingular, and worth thy Ob&s;ervation in this Place, as it recommends the Civility of the <HI>French</HI> Nation to all the World. The Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> taken Pri&s;oner, as I have &s;aid, by the Duke <HI>de Lorge,</HI> is a Man of Arms, a Lieutenant General in the Emperor's Ar|my, and a Prince of the Empire al&s;o; tho' he was but Admini&s;trator at pre&s;ent of the Dutchy of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> for the Heir his Nephew, who is a Minor.</P>
<P>Thou wilt ob&s;erve, in the U&s;age this Prince met with, how well the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers know their Duty, and what Re&s;pect their King, and all his Generals by his Command, &s;hews to captiv'd Princes or Officers of Quality; when he was taken Pri&s;oner, which, it &s;eems, was by a Lieutenant of Hor&s;e, he had not the lea&s;t Violence offer'd him, or any thing ta|ken from him; only the Officer de&s;ired &s;ome Token from him that he was the Per&s;on that gave him his Hand, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> that took him Pri&s;oner, and &s;av'd him from the Fury of the Soldiers; upon which the Duke took a fine Diamond-Ring from his Finger, and a
<PB N="215" REF="234">
Gold Watch out of his Pocket, and gave to the Lieutenant, who returned him his Watch again, and took his Parole of Honour that he would not offer to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Duke, however, de&s;ired the Lieutenant to accompany him to the General's Tent, which being in the Heat of Action, he could not do without Leave of his Captain; but the Captain, upon the News, &s;aluted the Prince, and gave the Lieutenant Orders to attend him.</P>
<P>When he was brought to the Duke <HI>de Lorge</HI>'s Tent, at his fir&s;t Salute he pre&s;ented his Sword and Pi&s;tols to him, the Prince holding the Point of the Sword and the Muzzles of the Pi&s;tols towards him&s;elf, which is the Cu&s;tom in the Field, when an Officer demands Quar|ter.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Lorge</HI> treated him with all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect, gave him back his Sword, and taking his Parole, gave him a Guard of two Captains to attend him, but without any Re&s;traint, except that as he was under Promi&s;e, it was under&s;tood that he was not to quit the Camp.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t Ceremony, the General ask'd his Highne&s;s, if the People that took him had offered him any Violence, or taken any thing from him; the Prince told him no; but that, on the contrary, the Lieutenant, to whom he &s;urrendered, had, with &s;ome Hazard to him&s;elf, prevented two Troopers, with whom he (the Prince) was engaged, from wounding him fir&s;t, as well as rifling him afterwards.</P>
<P>Upon this, the General cau&s;ed the Lieute|nant to be called in, and asking the Prince what the Value of what he had about him might amount to; he &s;aid about a Thou&s;and Crowns: Immediately he made the Lieutenant,
<PB N="216" REF="235">
Captain of a Troop in the &s;ame Regiment he &s;erv'd in, and told him that was for the Ser|vice he had done the King; then he gave him a Thou&s;and Crowns in Money, and told him, that was for his Care of the Prince his Pri&s;oner: In return to this, the Lieutenant pull'd off the Ring he had taken of the Duke as a Token, and re&s;tored it; the Duke took the Ring; but the next Morning &s;ent it him again, and an A&s;&s;ignment on the Town-hou&s;e of <HI>Nurembergh</HI> for 500 Crowns a Year during his Life.</P>
<P>When the Prince had been &s;ome time at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> the King &s;ent him an Invitation to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> ordered his Journey to be de|frayed all the Way, ordered all the Governours of Towns to receive him as a Prince, to &s;hew him all military Honours, to let him vi&s;it the Fortifications, and to beat the Drums as he pa&s;s'd, as if he had been a General of their own Army.</P>
<P>When he came to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> he was treated with the &s;ame Genero&s;ity, and with great Mag|nificence; the King received him with the utmo&s;t Civility and Ceremony, only told him he was obliged not to &s;ay he was glad to &s;ee him, becau&s;e of the Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>He was invited to come often to Court, and whenever he did come, the Officers of the Kitchin had Orders to provide a Table for him; the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e had Orders to provide the Coaches for him; and whenever he plea&s;ed to hunt, the Querries furni&s;hed him with Hor&s;es, Hounds, and Attendance from the King's Stables.</P>
<P>The King pre&s;ented him with his Picture &s;et with Diamonds, and with a very fine Jewel, and told him, he was &s;orry his Ran|&s;ome
<PB N="217" REF="236">
was not &s;ufficient to make it worth his pre&s;enting him with his Liberty; but he ho|ped he would take the Freedome of going home whenever he plea&s;ed, and in the mean Time all the Care po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be taken to make him forget his Misfortunes.</P>
<P>Valiant Aga, may the Angel that keeps the holy Gate, guard thee from falling into the Hands of the Enemies of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> let Princes be thy Pri&s;oners, and the Swords of the mightie&s;t of thy Enemies be delivered into thy Hands: Cruelty is not in thy Nature; happy will they be who fall into thy generous Hands, who knowe&s;t as well how to be merciful to the Mi&s;erable, as terrible to the De&s;perate.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s this courteous U&s;age of Pri|&s;oners is a generous Practice, and very con|&s;i&s;tent with the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t vigorous Me|thods of making War, and always has this Effect to the Advantage of tho&s;e that pra|cti&s;e it, that it is a Debt which &s;ome time or other comes to be paid to Advantage.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved al&s;o, that tho' the Prince had all po&s;&s;ible Liberty to go where he pleas'd, yet having pa&s;s'd his Parole, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to be a Pri&s;oner, he was obliged not to &s;erve again, or to appear in the Field again, till his Ran&s;om was paid, or that he was exchanged according to the Cartel, or Agreement for Exchange of Pri&s;oners.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. To <HI>Zema Ellmahannon,</HI> an old Der|vice at <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Affairs of the World are not uncer|tain by a meer fortuitous Accident of Cau&s;es, or in Obedience to the ill Fate of Men, upon whom tho&s;e Uncertainties fall, but by the meer Cour&s;e of Nature, the nece&s;&s;ary Event of things, tending naturally to daily Re|volution.</P>
<P>Death, the common Law of Nature, is not an Accident to Life, but a meer Con&s;equence of Being; every thing that has a Beginning, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily end; otherwi&s;e it would be a mon&s;trous Rupture in the Cour&s;e of Nature.</P>
<P>Nature it &s;elf is mortal; it is a Machine made up of innumerable Con&s;equences attend|ing the fir&s;t great Cau&s;e; the Motion given, it &s;hall continue as long as the Hand which fir&s;t put it together appointed it to go; but when the Weights are once run down, when the Clue is wound off, all the Powers cea&s;e, nothing can wind it up again.</P>
<P>Hence tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers here, who follow the old Notion of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> that the World was made, or rather made it &s;elf by meer Chance, by a fortuitous Conjunction of A|toms; I &s;ay, the&s;e Philo&s;ophers argue not on|ly ab&s;urdly, but even to the la&s;t Degree weakly and fooli&s;hly; for having traced the Beginning of Nature to the Atoms or Particles of Mat|ter flowing in the Aby&s;s, by who&s;e Conjun|ction
<PB N="219" REF="238">
and Attrition the beautiful Frame of the World has been made, and its Motion per|form'd, I &s;ay, they argue ab&s;urdly; for they mo&s;t ignorantly pa&s;s over the ju&s;t Progre&s;s of the Inquiry who fir&s;t gave Being to tho&s;e A|toms, which one Que&s;tion de&s;troys all their Sy&s;tem, according to that Di&s;tich of the Poet, &s;peaking of the Atoms jumbling together into the Frame of the World.<Q><L>Forgetting that &s;ome Power mu&s;t fir&s;t be&s;tow</L>
<L>Exi&s;tence on tho&s;e Atoms that did &s;o.</L></Q></P>
<P>They have another Fable here among the Naturali&s;ts; but it &s;eems not only an ignorant one, but a very unnatural one, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That Man made him&s;elf: I remember a learned <HI>A|rabian</HI> at the holy City, when in my Youth I attended the &s;acred Service with my Father, I &s;ay, a learned <HI>Arabian</HI> had a Debate with as learned a <HI>Jew</HI> on the Point I mention, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of a fir&s;t Cau&s;e in Nature; and coming down to the Being of Man, the <HI>Jew</HI> urged an Ar|gument which I now find much in U&s;e in this Nation of Athei&s;ts and Dei&s;ts, among whom I live, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of Man being his own Maker: <HI>Why then,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Amiaz Zebir Oglou,</HI> &s;o was the ancient <HI>Arabian</HI> called, why then, &s;ays he, <HI>Man mu&s;t be eternal;</HI> for what could give it &s;elf Life, could certainly pre&s;erve Life; and if Man is eternal, &s;ays he, then Man is God; for whatever is eternal is God.</P>
<P>The Ancients told a merry Fable of <HI>Pro|metheus,</HI> who having made a Man of Clay, &s;tole Fire from the Sun to put Life into his Figure, for which Felony, &s;ay they, he was condemned to be chained down to a Rock,
<PB N="220" REF="239">
where a great Vulture was always preying up|on his Bowels.</P>
<P>But looking into an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet lately, where this Fable was mentioned, as alluding to the ancient Principle of Athei&s;m above, I met the&s;e Lines drawn from the &s;ame rea&s;oning as tho&s;e above.<Q><L>The great <HI>Promethean</HI> Arti&s;t, Poets &s;ay,</L>
<L>Fir&s;t made the Model of a Man in Clay;</L>
<L>Contriv'd the Form, of Parts, and when he had done,</L>
<L>Stole Vital Heat from the Prolifick Sun:</L>
<L>But not a Poet tells us to this Day,</L>
<L>Who made <HI>Prometheus</HI> first, and who the Clay;</L>
<L>Who gave the great Prolifick to the Sun,</L>
<L>And where the fir&s;t Productive Work begun.</L></Q></P>
<P>I wonder often how the&s;e <HI>Nazareens,</HI> who are neverthele&s;s a knowing and learned People, e&s;pecially in the&s;e Parts; I &s;ay, I often reflect with Wonder, whence this bruti&s;h Notion is derived, I mean, of denying the Being of a God, and all the &s;ub&s;equent Notions of the World's Eternity, Man's &s;elf-exi&s;tent Power, and the like.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I have re&s;olved it into this, that it is the natural Con&s;equence of the Cor|ruption of their own Religion; for while their Prie&s;ts &s;et up here &s;o many Ab&s;urdities, and pay their Adorations to &s;o many &s;uppo&s;ed Deities, Men of Penetration frequently &s;ee through all the fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es of the Clergy, and find it often a Legend of Forgeries, a meer Bundle of Non&s;en&s;e, and Incon&s;i&s;tencies, and then not being enlightened from Heaven with the &s;acred Knowledge of the true ONE God, it leads them into a Contempt of all Princi|ples,
<PB N="221" REF="240">
and their Religion dwindles away to no|thing; they begin in ridiculing their own Profe&s;&s;ion, and then go on to the great Ex|tream of denying even God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such a Crime is never found among the Followers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the fir&s;t Principle of who&s;e Religion contains a Confe&s;&s;ion of One God; the Faithful are therefore called Mu&s;&s;ul|mans, the Name we boa&s;t of, &s;ignifying a Belie|ver of the One God, and of <HI>Mahomet</HI> his Pro|phet.</P>
<P>The Light of the divine Oracle, which in|&s;pired <HI>Mahomet,</HI> &s;hines into the Under&s;tandings of the Faithful, and they wor&s;hip the Creator of the World: They neither kneel to a Piece of Bread, nor wor&s;hip an old Woman, and call her God's Mother; but declare to all the World, that God is One God, and to him alone we pray with ince&s;&s;ant Prayers, revolving the Moon, and con&s;tant as the Day.</P>
<P>Receive, righteous <HI>Zema,</HI> the Relation of the Bla&s;phemies of the&s;e Mockers of God, and pray to <HI>Mahomet</HI> that all his faithful Follow|ers may be kept in the right Way.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. To <HI>Ali,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, Chief of the Engineers, and Seraskeir of the <HI>Morea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN I wrote la&s;t to thee, I gave thee an Account of the taking the &s;trong Town of <HI>Montmelian,</HI> in the Dominions of <HI>Sa|voy,</HI> with &s;ome De&s;cription of the Fortre&s;s it &s;elf, and bad thee to expect to hear from me again.</P>
<P>According to my Word, I here &s;end thee true Drafts of the &s;everal Towns, and the Sieges of them, which have been carried on the&s;e la&s;t two Years by the <HI>French,</HI> who are now certainly the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in the World of the Art of rai&s;ing Fortifications, and of at|tacking them when they have done.</P>
<P>The Fortifications of the Town and Port of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> I &s;end thee as a thing by it &s;elf, be|cau&s;e I am inform'd the Grand Seignior has commanded thee to make a Port and Harbour at <HI>Candia,</HI> which he de&s;igns to make the &s;trong|e&s;t City, and the &s;afe&s;t Harbour in the World.</P>
<P>Thou wilt &s;ee by this Plan, that the <HI>French</HI> Engineers had a Piece of Work to do here, the Scituation of which did not appear to the Eye capable of being made to bear the Perfe|ction of it; they had a Harbour and Ba&s;in to build, which the King re&s;olved &s;hould be ca|pable of receiving his large&s;t Men of War, &s;ome of which drew 24 to 26 Foot Water, and the Channel of the Port they had to work it on, had not above 11 Foot Water at the
<PB N="223" REF="242">
highe&s;t Tides; and this upon a flat Shore, where the Sea, except at Spring-Tides, &s;carce flow'd 4 Foot in a Tide, &s;ometimes &s;carce flow'd at all into the Town.</P>
<P>To bring this to Perfection, the Engineers fir&s;t con&s;idered a &s;mall River which pa&s;s'd through the flat Country above, and emptied it &s;elf into the Sea at this Place, who&s;e little Channel, &s;carce de&s;erving the Name of a River, made the Port.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the Engineers had to do, was to draw the Water of &s;everal other &s;mall Rivers, which, in their natural Cour&s;e, ran into the Sea at other Places on the Coa&s;t, to join their Waters with this little Stream, and then they laid the large Parts of low Land (which you &s;ee mark'd in the Plan) together, for receiving the Quantity of Water when it &s;hould come in, and &s;top it in this River when the Sluices were &s;hut.</P>
<P>Below the Conjunction of the&s;e Waters, &s;e|veral large Sluices were made, to &s;top their Cour&s;e, and &s;well them till they flow'd over all tho&s;e Lands, and &s;o keep them up till a very great Head of Water was gotten toge|ther, for the U&s;es of which I &s;hall &s;peak pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>When this Provi&s;ion for a Back-water was fir&s;t made, then they went to work with the Channel of the Port, which they cut 14 Foot in Depth into the Earth deeper than it was before.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure this Work, and pre&s;erve the Depth of the Channel, which the Sea would other|wi&s;e fill up, even in one Tide, it being a very flat and &s;andy Shore; I &s;ay, to &s;ecure this, they built tho&s;e two prodigious Jettes or Peirs, which you &s;ee in the Draught, which
<PB N="224" REF="243">
ran out into the Sea no le&s;s than 11000 <HI>Hemiza's,</HI> being almo&s;t an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile and a half, even to low Water-Mark, form'd of an innumerable Number of Trees, of an immen&s;e Size, bound with Iron, and &s;harpen'd at Bottom, and driven with the Force of mighty Blows by a <HI>Bolqueen</HI> of a Ton Weight, rai&s;ed high in the Air, and let fall at once. They call the&s;e Trees here <HI>Pilotis.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two Peirs being made &s;olid, the Spaces fill'd up with Stone and Chalk, and the Heads joined together with Bars of Iron, are firm as the &s;olid Earth; and breaking off the Violence of the Sea make the Space between a calm, &s;afe Channel, into which when Ships were entred, they were &s;ecured from any Ha|zards of Wind or Weather.</P>
<P>They al&s;o took Care to pre&s;erve the Channel, which, as I have &s;aid, was thus deep, from fill|ing up by the Sea; and at the upper End of it, and within the Fortifications of the Town, a large Ba&s;in or Pool was made, able to receive the bigge&s;t Ships, and able to contain above 300 Sail; at the Entrance into which was a Sluice or Water-Stop, the Gates of which were Six and fifty Foot wide; be|ing a Work of that prodigious Expence, and requiring &s;o much Skill of the Engineer, that &s;ome Workmen of very good Experience de|clared to the King, it was impo&s;&s;ible that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vauban,</HI> who&s;e Undertaking the whole Work was, could ever bring it to Per|fection.</P>
<P>But he laugh'd at them all, and went on, fini&s;h'd it, and brought the Gates of that im|men&s;e Sluice to &s;o exact a Ballance, that they are now made to open and &s;hut by the Hands of two Men only, <HI>(viz.)</HI> one at each Gate.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="244">
The Sluice fir&s;t &s;poken of, which kept in the Land-Water, now di&s;covered its U&s;eful|ne&s;s, and the exqui&s;ite Skill of the Workman; for whenever the Channel &s;eem'd to fill, or the Sea ca&s;t any Banks of Sand up again&s;t the Mouth of the Peirs, as it would have done in two or three Tides, the opening this Sluice let go a mighty Stream of Water, which they call a Back-Water, or Back-current, which al|ways keeps the Channel open to its full Depth.</P>
<P>Thus this mighty Work is fini&s;h'd, the Wonder of this Part of the World. As to the innumerable Works for &s;trengthning the Town, the Ri&s;ebank for farther &s;trengthning the Port, an immen&s;e Work, advanced in the very Sea, and founded al&s;o upon Piles, yet made &s;o &s;trong as not only to carry 100 Guns, which are planted on its Parapet, but to bear 300 Dwelling-Hou&s;es and a Church or Mo&s;que, and &s;o become a little Town of its &s;elf: All this I refer thee for to the Plan of the Work, which is without Que&s;tion the mo&s;t perfect Fortification in the World; and if it ever &s;hould be attack'd, as it will require an Army to defend it, &s;o they mu&s;t expect to lo&s;e a good Army before it that attempt it.</P>
<P>They are aware here that the King of <HI>En|gland,</HI> the mo&s;t enterprizing Prince in this Part of the World, has his Eye upon it; e|&s;pecially &s;ince the Victory over the <HI>French</HI> Fleet has &s;ecured him the Superiority at Sea; and therefore the Generals always keep a watchful Eye over it, and very rarely have le&s;s than 18 or 20000 Men in it, or within Reach of it, when the Campaign is over.</P>
<P>The Fortifications of this Place, including the Harbour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is &s;aid to have co&s;t the,
<PB N="226" REF="245">
King of <HI>France</HI> Twenty Thou&s;and Pur&s;es, which, in the Coin of this Country, is called no le&s;s than an Hundred Millions of their Money.</P>
<P>The Draft of this Place is worth thy Study, and worthy the Hand of a Power immen&s;e and inimitable, like that of the Grand Seigni|or; half the Care and Art which is &s;hew'd here, would make the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> which is &s;o much envied by the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> be the &s;a|fe&s;t and mo&s;t terrible Port in the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>Succe&s;s and Wonders be the End of all thy Undertakings, and let the Glory of thy illu|&s;trious Lord be made more and more con&s;pi|cuous by thy exqui&s;ite Performances. The o|ther Plans which I &s;end thee I &s;hall write of by thy Servant the <HI>Chaioux, Mu&s;tapha,</HI> who is here with me, and who I &s;hall di&s;patch in Twelve Days to the Kaimacham on Bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance.</P>

<P>There has been a Con&s;piracy detected in the Confederate Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the new King of <HI>England;</HI> the Con&s;piracy it &s;elf, tho' odious and dete&s;table in its Nature, is not the main thing I take notice of to thee; for &s;uch things are frequent among the&s;e <HI>Na|zareens,</HI> tho' not heard of among the true Be|lievers of the One God, the faithful Follow|ers of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> I &s;ay, among the Mu&s;&s;ulmans, no &s;uch thing is ever heard of; it is below the Dignity of Man, as a Man, to kill by Trea&s;on; nor can the religious Principles of tho&s;e, who believe the Rewards of Paradi&s;e, or the Torment of Fire, permit them to think of &s;uch Practices without Horror. Thank <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> it is only practi&s;ed among Chri&s;tians, the Mu&s;&s;ulmans abhor it.</P>
<P>I &s;ay therefore, I had not mentioned this Crime, odious in its &s;elf even to humane Na|ture, it is not the Fact it &s;elf which I in&s;i&s;t upon, but this in particular, that there is great Rea&s;on to believe the King of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t his chief Mini&s;ters of State, (and they, we know, dare do nothing without his Orders) have been di&s;covered to be in the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce to be thought of, without Hor|ror and Execration, that Men of Honour, <HI>as they call them&s;elves here,</HI> &s;hould &s;toop to mur|ther the Man they cannot conquer. In all the Reigns of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes, or of the Ca|liphs of <HI>Syria,</HI> in all the Days of the <HI>Saracen</HI> Empire, the true Succe&s;&s;ors of our great Pro|phet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who&s;e more righteous Law for|bids

Rap'n, Inju&s;tice, and Blood, no &s;uch thing has yet been left upon Record.</P>
<P>Was it ever known that any of the Princes, Followers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> ever &s;ent an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inator, or Murtherer, to cut off a <HI>Nazareen</HI> Prince, General, or Commander of an Army, by Trea|&s;on, tho' we e&s;teem the <HI>Nazareens</HI> as Dogs, Ene|mies of God, and &s;uch as of right demand to be cut off from the Earth; yet it is al|ways attempted honourably, by War and the Arm of Battle; as open Enemies ought to deal with one another, leaving the Sword to decide the Quarrel, and God to direct as be&s;t plea&s;es him.</P>
<P>Never, I &s;ay, was any <HI>Nazareen</HI> Prince, Cap|tain-General, or other Enemy, &s;urprized on our Account, by Trea&s;on and Murther: The&s;e People value them&s;elves upon the Name by which they pretend to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, <HI>(viz)</HI> Chri&s;tians; and the King of <HI>France</HI> is called the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King; as if he was more a Chri&s;tian, or a better Man than other Kings; but this Affair has &s;ullied his Face, and black|ened his Character in &s;uch a Manner, as all the other idolatrous Nations in the World would abhor: and let them &s;ay what they will, it &s;eems to me that the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Princi|ples are not allowed, at lea&s;t not &s;o much, if at all, by any People in the World, but the&s;e Chri&s;tians. In the Name of <HI>Mahomet</HI> let them have the Prai&s;e of it; let them be the only People in the World who deal in &s;ecret Mur|ther.</P>
<P>As to the King of <HI>France,</HI> Men may call him the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King as long as they plea&s;e; but if he gives Encouragement to &s;uch Villanies as the&s;e, I dare pronounce <HI>Caius Fa|britius,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Pagan, a far better Chri&s;tian
<PB N="229" REF="248">
than the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King; for he being General of the <HI>Romans,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> King of <HI>Macedon,</HI> one of the &s;toute&s;t Enemies the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> ever had; when the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Prince's Phy&s;ician came and promi&s;ed him to poy&s;on his Ma&s;ter for a Sum of Money, he not only &s;corn'd his Propo&s;als, but &s;ent him with a Letter, di&s;covering his Treachery to the King, to deal with him according to his De&s;erts.</P>
<P>This was done like a <HI>Roman;</HI> but the King of <HI>France,</HI> like tho&s;e who they call here Chri&s;tians, has not thought fit to act in &s;uch a generous Manner; for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Granval,</HI> who, it was proved openly, had undertaken the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King of <HI>England,</HI> had, it &s;eems, been encouraged to, and employed in this horrid Work, fir&s;t by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvois,</HI> the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of State to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ince his Death by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Barba&s;ieux</HI> his Son, with the Gift of Eighty Pi&s;tols, a &s;mall Piece of Gold Coin which goes here for four Ducates, and with the Promi&s;e of twen|ty Thou&s;and Livres <HI>per Ann.</HI> Reward when the Murther was committed.</P>
<P>This it &s;eems has been proved in the mili|tary Divan, or as they call it here, the <HI>Court Martial;</HI> and the Per&s;on has been condemned and executed for it; even him&s;elf not denying the Fact.</P>
<P>Nor do they concern them&s;elves much to deny it here, or to di&s;own that he was em|ployed by the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters; for the&s;e are, it &s;eems, above covering &s;uch things from the World, not valuing the Cen&s;ures of Men how|ever ju&s;t.</P>
<P>There is a noble Principle in the Minds of wi&s;e Men, which qualifies them to &s;upport the Cen&s;ures and Reproaches of the World, and
<PB N="230" REF="249">
to receive the vile&s;t U&s;age with the highe&s;t Contempt, and this is an Attainment worthy of a good Man, and makes a Man truly great; but this is always built upon this Preliminary as a Foundation, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the Charge is un|ju&s;t, as well as indecent; that the Per&s;on is in|nocent; for no wi&s;e Man can bear a ju&s;t Cen|&s;ure; if his own Heart reproaches him with the Crime, his Face is covered with Blu&s;hes at the Cen&s;ure, and he &s;inks under the Weight of the Reflection, as a Child does under the Stripes of his Preceptor.</P>
<P>To contemn ju&s;t Cen&s;ure is the Token of a Face hardened by Crime, grown wicked to a Degree, above being touch'd by Con&s;cience or Principles of Honour, and is a Token not of a very wi&s;e Man, but of a very wicked Man.</P>
<P>It is with &s;ome Horror I write of this par|ticular Circum&s;tance; if Kings can thus ju&s;ti|fie the &s;urprizing their oppo&s;ite Princes with Murther and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, what need is there of making War? It is enough to revenge the Injury done by the Hands of Villains and A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inators, and we may leave the Kings of the Earth to kill one another, without engaging Armies of innocent People in the Quarrel.</P>
<P>Men of ju&s;t Principles abhor the&s;e things, and indeed the King is exclaimed again&s;t u|niver&s;ally in all Foreign Courts on this Affair. At home here, 'tis true, People dare &s;ay no|thing; &s;o they ca&s;t it all upon Mon&s;ieur <HI>Barbi|&s;ieux,</HI> and clear the King of the Scandal of it.</P>
<P>If this wicked Cu&s;tom prevails, Kings are the mo&s;t unhappy of Men; they mu&s;t live wrapt in Iron for the Day, and &s;leep covered with Terrors in the Night; the Dagger and the Pi&s;tol would be their daily Dread; and as it was &s;aid of the fir&s;t <HI>James</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="250">
they would bewray Nature at the Sight of a naked Sword.</P>
<P>It appears upon Record, in the Hi&s;tories of the&s;e Parts of the World, that the Ance|&s;tor of this Prince, the King of <HI>England,</HI> was murthered in the &s;ame Manner as has been thus attempted now; and that it was done in Con&s;equence of the Pro&s;cription of his Ene|my the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> who publickly invited all the Men of villainous Principles, of which the <HI>Nazareens</HI> never want Examples, to murther the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> promi&s;ing a Reward of a Thou&s;and Pi&s;tols to the Per&s;on who &s;hould kill him.</P>
<P>But the whole World blamed the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for it; even when he publi&s;hed the In|vitation to Murther, and &s;everal of the Princes, even of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s own Party, openly prote&s;ted again&s;t it; but much more after the Murther was committed, and the Murtherer confe&s;s'd, that it was upon the hearing of that Proclamation that he undertook it; I &s;ay, from that Time the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was ab|horr'd by all Men of Honour, as a Tyrant, a Man of Cruelty, and a Murtherer; nor did righteous Heaven pro&s;per any of his Affairs after it.</P>
<P>After all, the King of <HI>England</HI> lives; the Tray|tor has been put to Death, and the Horror of the Fact has cemented, rather than weaken'd the Confederacy; nay, it has fill'd the Enemies of <HI>France</HI> with that Animo&s;ity again&s;t her Ma|nagement, that it may be truly &s;aid of the King, he has nothing to tru&s;t to but the Sword; for the lea&s;t and weake&s;t of his Enemies are deaf to all Accommodations.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. To <HI>Ali,</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, Chief of the Engineers, and Seraskeir of the <HI>Morea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am to thee like a Student in Divinity, who I have heard much of among the <HI>Nazareens,</HI> who being appointed, in one of their Tetrehs or Colleges, to read Lectures to the Scholars upon &s;ome of the Books of the old Prophets in the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> cho&s;e the Book called the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> containing above Sixty Chapters, and read Forty four Year upon the fir&s;t Chapter, and did not fini&s;h it neither.</P>
<P>Thus de&s;igning, in my la&s;t Letter, to &s;end thee a Lecture of Fortifications and Attacks up|on all the Towns or Sieges which have been the Subject of Di&s;cour&s;e here during this War; I &s;pent my whole Letter upon the Town and Port of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and have done very little in|deed towards fini&s;hing it either; but thy ma|thematical Genius will &s;upply the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Next to this Town, I begin with the Town of <HI>Mons,</HI> of the Siege of which I wrote former|ly to the Port; after thou ha&s;t &s;urveyed the Works, how regular, how large, how well &s;cituated for Defence, and how well defended by a re&s;olute Garri&s;on, who fail'd in no Part of their Duty, thou wilt perhaps wonder how it came to be carried, as it were, Sword in Hand, that is to &s;ay, in about 18 Days af|ter the Trenches were opened.</P>
<P>But thou wilt be more fully &s;atisfied when thou &s;halt ob&s;erve &s;ome Marks I have made
<PB N="233" REF="252">
in the Plan of the Siege, by which it will be &s;een, that the <HI>French</HI> began with draining the Mora&s;s, which lies on one Part of the Town, which the Confederates thought was impra|cticable, and by which Means they came dry|footed to the Town, on a Side where there were very &s;light Works, the <HI>Germans</HI> believing that the Place was inacce&s;&s;ible on that Side.</P>
<P>The Siege of <HI>Namure</HI> is the mo&s;t remarkable in this Part of the Country, of which al&s;o I have written particularly before: The Ca&s;tle is a very inacce&s;&s;ible thing, and is defended by its Scituation, which is not only rai&s;ed high on the Summit of a Rock, as you will &s;ee by the Plan; but is &s;eated in the Angle of two large Rivers, the <HI>Sambre</HI> and the <HI>Maez,</HI> like the City of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> between the <HI>Sauve</HI> and the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>But the Strength of this Ca&s;tle is doubled by a Work call'd the <HI>Cohorne</HI> Fort, which is a Royal Fortification, built by one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cohorne,</HI> a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Engineer, and a Lieutenant General in the Confederates Army. The Plan of this Fort will &s;hew thee the Skill of the Engineer; and the gallant Defence he made in it, again&s;t the whole <HI>French</HI> Army, will &s;hew thee his Bravery; but the Con&s;equence of this Fort be&s;t appears by telling thee, that the Ca|&s;tle, however &s;trong in it &s;elf, made very lit|tle Defence after the Surrender of this Fort.</P>
<P>The Plan of the Port of <HI>Nice</HI> and the City of <HI>Villa Franca;</HI> as al&s;o of the Port and Town of <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> in <HI>Rou&s;illon,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Spain,</HI> as they have a great Similitude to one another, and have both met with the &s;ame Fate, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to be attack'd by the <HI>French,</HI> during this War; &s;o they will &s;hew thee perfectly well, how fatal an Error it is, to leave Ports of &s;uch
<PB N="234" REF="253">
Con&s;equence, and &s;o capable of being ren|der'd impregnable, &s;o naked and defencele&s;s, as both tho&s;e Places were.</P>
<P>This is a Mi&s;take the <HI>French</HI> King is never guilty of; whatever Town is taken by him, is &s;ure to get by the Exchange of Ma&s;ters; for he always makes it &s;tronger than it was be|fore; and almo&s;t all the Frontier Places ha|ving been fir&s;t or la&s;t in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>France,</HI> owe mo&s;t of their Strength to his Dili|gence in fortifying them.</P>
<P>This al&s;o is like to be the Fate of <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> and of <HI>Nice;</HI> for the <HI>French</HI> Engineers are at work already upon them both, and they tell us, that <HI>Nice</HI> e&s;pecially &s;hall be made impregnable, and the Harbour be made capable of recei|ving the large&s;t Men of War; and tho' he may do this, yet 'tis odds but in Time he comes to render this Town up to the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on indeed of this Difference be|tween the Towns po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by <HI>France,</HI> and tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by other Princes, is chiefly this, that the latter want Money, and the King of <HI>France</HI> always abounds; that the latter, when they have Money, care not to lay it out on &s;uch things; and the other &s;pares no Expence to make Places &s;trong; believing it, <HI>as it often times appears to be,</HI> the be&s;t Money he can lay out.</P>
<P>I cannot but think the Frontiers of the Grand Seignior's Dominions deficient on this very Article, how el&s;e could the effeminate <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have reduc'd &s;o important a Town as that of <HI>A&s;oph</HI> on the <HI>Paulus Meotis?</HI> Had the King of <HI>France</HI> been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch a Fortre&s;s, it would have been made as terrible as <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and it would never have been in the Power of any Enemy, much le&s;s a contempti|ble
<PB N="235" REF="254">
Nation, of whom it u&s;ually was a Say|ing at the Port, that they neither knew how to make Peace or War.</P>
<P>I doubt not thou art forward enough to regulate the&s;e Matters, and had the Royal imperial Mandate i&s;&s;ued out to thee, <HI>A|&s;oph</HI> would long ago have been a Place as impregnable as any of the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Ports are, to none of which the Confederates have been yet able to approach, through the whole Series of the War, no not &s;ince they have boa&s;ted of their Superiority at Sea.</P>
<P>Nor is our Lord the Grand Seignior, who&s;e Name I mention with Reverence, bowing my Head to the Ground, the Brightne&s;s of the up|per Regions of Light be on his Head; I &s;ay, our mighty Emperor, the Lord of the World, is not unwilling to allow the Expence of ne|ce&s;&s;ary Fortifications to &s;trengthen the Towns expo&s;ed to his Enemies; but it has been the Negligence or Covetou&s;ne&s;s of the Viziers, to whom the Emperor has committed the Charge of tho&s;e things.</P>
<P>Vigilant <HI>Ali,</HI> thou art always awake to the Intere&s;t of thy Ma&s;ter, and to the Glory of his Empire, extended from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Seas. I know that nothing e&s;capes thy Ob&s;ervation. I conjure thee by the Du&s;t of happy <HI>Icharrah,</HI> thy Predece&s;&s;or, who&s;e Dwelling is in Paradi&s;e; by the Bones of thy great Grandfather <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who was principal Engineer to <HI>Solyman</HI> the magnificent, at the famous Sieges of <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Maltha;</HI> by the brazen Gates of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and the invincible Turrets of <HI>Medina,</HI> let not the Hint I am now going to give thee be forgot|ten, neither take it in evil Part from me, who am anxious for the Glory of our invincible Lord <HI>Achmet,</HI> Emperor of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="255">
Take it not in evil Part that I ask this important Que&s;tion, why is not <HI>Belgrade,</HI> which is now fallen into the Hands of thy Lord, why, I &s;ay, is it not made the mo&s;t invinci|ble Place on Earth?</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t it is not, and that it has all the Advantages by Scituation which can be de&s;ired; two mighty Rivers wa&s;h its Walls with their furious Currents, <HI>(viz)</HI> the <HI>Sauve</HI> and the <HI>Danube;</HI> the Angle where they join is wholly taken up with the Town and Ca&s;tle, which are thereby utterly inacce&s;&s;ible on two Sides of three; had the King of <HI>France</HI> this im|portant Place, his Engineers, in &s;pight of the harde&s;t Rocks, the highe&s;t Mountains, the mo&s;t impenetrable Parts of the Earth, would long ago have brought the <HI>Sauve</HI> to have en|tirely &s;urrounded the Town, and to have em|braced it with its divided Stream, equally deep, navigable, and rapid like the other Part.</P>
<P>Infinite Ba&s;tions, Cavaliers, Parapets, Lines, Courtins, Tenails, Ravelines, Counter&s;carps, Motes, covered Ways, Horn-works, Crown|works, Lunettes, Retrenchments, Redoubts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould have ere now &s;o &s;urrounded the Town, as not to make it po&s;&s;ible for any Army to attack it without the certain Ruin of their Infantry.</P>
<P>When it was la&s;t taken, the Works were, ge|nerally &s;peaking, entirely demoli&s;hed by the Bla&s;t of Powder, which blew it up: Why &s;hould not all the Plan of the Place have received a new Face, and why not make it &s;trong enough to be worthy the Name of the Bulwark of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire?</P>
<P>Flatter not thy &s;elf that the Power of thy Lord is &s;o great, that it will never &s;uffer any Revolution, or that the victorious Vizier can
<PB N="237" REF="256">
never meet with any Foil; the&s;e things are influenced by the &s;ecret de&s;tinated Appoint|ments of him that guides thee and I, and eve|ry Head that bears the Charge of a Soul; and albeit that what is thus appointed &s;hall not be revers'd, yet &s;uch Agency as that of gi|ving a Stop to the Enemies of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of humane Power, is always al|lowed to be be&s;towed on the Faithful; and the Aids of Art to &s;upport us in the Defence of the Dominions of our Emperor was always al|lowed not as lawful only, but expedient at all Times, leaving the I&s;&s;ues of things to God and <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Rouze up thy &s;elf, thou Man of Knowledge, and apply thy &s;elf to &s;trengthen this Fron|tier, &s;urround it with innumerable Works, &s;pare no Co&s;t or Labour to make it a Terror of the <HI>Nazareen</HI> Empire, extend it to &s;uch Li|mits that its Garri&s;on may be an Army, and that to inve&s;t it may require 200000 Men.</P>
<P>Draw round it a treble Counter&s;carp, I know the Scituation will allow it; for the inmo&s;t Works are high as a Mountain, and will overlook &s;even De&s;cents below it.</P>
<P>The two Heights of <HI>Orwar</HI> next the River <HI>Sauve,</HI> will require a double Crown-work to &s;urround them, with a Parapet high as a Ca|vallier, if it &s;hould be attack'd; and &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be carried Sword in Hand, it is im|po&s;&s;ible an Enemy can make a Lodgment in it, the Troops which &s;hall be po&s;ted in the Moun|tain, will pour in &s;uch Floods of livid Fire of Shot, of Grenadoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that nothing can &s;up|port it.</P>
<P>On the Side next the <HI>Danube,</HI> the Hill <HI>Ibrahim, Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> readily guides thy Hand to erect a Royal Fort; under its Protection no Ships from the

<HI>Danube</HI> can batter it, the Rock defending its Flanks; the &s;ame Rock affording at the &s;ame Time a natural Line for 100 Pieces of Cannon, to cut off even the Navigation of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and &s;end to the Bottom the &s;tronge&s;t Ve&s;&s;els which &s;hall attempt to lie open to it.</P>
<P>Glorious <HI>Ali,</HI> why is not this City made the Bulwark of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire? Depend up|on it, as the Arms of the victorious <HI>Kuprioli</HI> have conquered this Fortre&s;s, &s;o the <HI>Nazareens</HI> will lo&s;e no Opportunity of recovering it; and if once they are Ma&s;ters of it again, they will not fail to make it the &s;tronge&s;t Fortre&s;s in the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. To the Kaimacham.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Note.</HI> This Letter &s;hould have been printed in page 157, Book II. and Letter XII. in the &s;ame Book, &s;hould have been placed here.</HEAD>
<P>WOnder not that I follow &s;o &s;oon my la&s;t Expre&s;s with another Letter almo&s;t upon the &s;ame Subject: The King of <HI>France</HI> is certainly the mo&s;t politick Prince in the World; he knew not only what was concluded again&s;t him at the <HI>Hague,</HI> in the great Congre&s;s of Princes, which I mentioned in my la&s;t, and which met there the Beginning of the la&s;t Moon; but he knew the Reputation that il|lu&s;trious Appearance of Princes would give to the confederated Arms, if they had lei&s;ure given them to go on as they began, and there|fore, to give &s;ome &s;udden <HI>Coup de Eclat</HI> in the Infancy of their Alliance, was not only the be&s;t way to weaken and di&s;concert them, but al&s;o to le&s;&s;en the Reputation of a Body, mon&s;trous like <HI>Hydra,</HI> and compo&s;ed of many Heads as well as many Members.</P>
<P>However, he lay &s;till till the Prince of <HI>O|range</HI> had broken up his Congre&s;s, and was gone to his Palace of <HI>Loo,</HI> a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure in, the <HI>Dutch Gueldre,</HI> where he de&s;ign'd to pa&s;s the Time till the Sea&s;on for taking the Field &s;hould call him away.</P>
<P>But he was &s;carce gotten thither, when Ex|pre&s;&s;es, in the Heels of one another, brought
<PB N="240" REF="259">
him Word, that the <HI>French</HI> were making Prepara|tions, in all their Frontier-Garri&s;ons, for &s;ome great Enterprize; and that tho' the Sea&s;on for Armies to take the Field was not yet, by two Moons at lea&s;t, yet it was certain the <HI>French</HI> would march very quickly.</P>
<P>This alarmed the Prince, who was him|&s;elf perfectly vigilant, and as able to judge of the De&s;igns of the Enemy as any Offi|cer in his Army. The <HI>Hague,</HI> which but a few Days before was throng'd with Princes, General-Officers, and Colonels of the Army, was, on a &s;udden, an abandon'd de&s;olate Place, compared to what it was before, the Governors of Towns and Provinces, the Generals, the Officers, were all flown to their re&s;pective Commands, as if they had been driven away with a Storm of Wind.</P>
<P>Nor was it without Cau&s;e; for in about ten Days after the fir&s;t Alarm, they found the <HI>French,</HI> who&s;e Motions are the &s;wifte&s;t of any Nation in the World, were actually in the Field with 60000 Men, and in le&s;s than Five Days more, in Spight of the Severity of a terrible Sea&s;on, Difficulty of impa&s;&s;able Roads, and of all the Inconveniencies of a Winter-Siege, they had inve&s;ted the City of <HI>Mons,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Hainault,</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h Low Countries.</HI> This was the 14<HI>th</HI> Day of the third Moon.</P>
<P>This Place is not only con&s;iderable in its &s;elf, as it is a very &s;trong Frontier; but al&s;o as it &s;ecures a &s;pacious Country, which will be at the Di&s;po&s;al of the <HI>French,</HI> if they &s;ucceed in their De&s;ign; it is environed on every Side with good Fortifications, except on that Side which is between the Gates of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Aeh,</HI> where there is only a bare Wall, &s;ecured by a large and deep Mora&s;s; &s;o that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="241" REF="260">
to be approach'd that Way: But they &s;ay the De&s;ign of the <HI>French</HI> is to drain the Mora&s;s, which being done, the Town will be ea&s;ily taken; and to that Purpo&s;e, as impo&s;&s;ible as the De&s;ign &s;eems to be, yet they have got to|gether Twenty Thou&s;and Pioneers, from all the Frontiers, which they have &s;et to work, under the Protection of an Army of Sixty Thou&s;and Men. The Garri&s;on is &s;aid to con|&s;i&s;t of Seven Thou&s;and well di&s;ciplined Sol|diers, of which the greate&s;t Part are <HI>Germans;</HI> and be&s;ides them there is a great Number of the Town&s;men, well exerci&s;ed in Arms, who have promi&s;ed to make a vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance, all under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Bergues,</HI> who pretended to hold it out to the ut|mo&s;t; neverthele&s;s <HI>France</HI> made this Bu&s;ine&s;s a Point of Honour, and there could be no Que&s;ti|on but they will put as fair for it as po&s;&s;ible; the King, the Dauphine, mo&s;t of the Mare|&s;chals of <HI>France,</HI> and all the be&s;t Generals of the Kingdom, were there to &s;ee the general A&s;&s;ault; to which Purpo&s;e they have drawn out of <HI>Germany</HI> all their be&s;t Men; in a Word, it may be &s;aid, that the whole Power of <HI>France</HI> is going to fall upon that poor City.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came immediately back from <HI>Loo,</HI> having &s;taid there but two Nights; Expre&s;&s;es flew like Po&s;ts riding on a Whirlwind to all the Confederate-Princes for Help, and all the Troops near Hand were or|dered to the general Rendezvous.</P>
<P>But <HI>alas!</HI> what &s;ignified Troops in <HI>Brandex|burgh,</HI> the Land of <HI>He&s;&s;ia,</HI> or other remote Countries, to an Army in full March, and a Town already inve&s;ted with Ten Thou&s;and Hor&s;e. The <HI>French,</HI> &s;ecure of the Succe&s;s, pu&s;h|ed the Siege with the utmo&s;t Vigour; and to
<PB N="242" REF="261">
encourage the Soldiers, by the Pre&s;ence of &s;o illu&s;trious a Leader, the King him&s;elf re&s;olved to command the Siege; he arrived in the Camp the 21<HI>&s;t</HI> of the third Moon, vi&s;ited the Po&s;ts him&s;elf, had an Officer killed with a Cannon-Shot ju&s;t at his Elbow, and &s;aw the Trenches opened before the Place, in his own Pre&s;ence, on the 24<HI>th,</HI> and on the 8th of this Moon the Town capitulated.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI> drew together all the Troops which were within Reach, and en|camped at <HI>Hall,</HI> not far from the <HI>French</HI> Camp; but he never could get above 34000 Men to|gether.</P>
<P>The Town made a very vigorous Defence, and the Garri&s;on were reduced to 2400 Men; but the Fury of the <HI>French</HI> could not be with|&s;tood, who, with a numerous Artillery, beat down all the Defences of the Place, and followed it with &s;uch continued Attacks, not valuing the Lives of their Men, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to hold out.</P>
<P>The Town having capitulated, the <HI>French</HI> have put 10000 Foot and 4000 Hor&s;e into it, as a Garri&s;on, and are retir'd into Quarters, having thus cut their Enemies out Work e|nough, in the Morning of the Campaign, to keep them employed perhaps all the re&s;t of the Time.</P>
<P>As the King, by this &s;udden Blow, has been before hand with the Confederates, &s;o he lets them &s;ee that by entering the Fields, &s;o be|fore the u&s;ual Time, he will be always before them, and that their Confederacy will have no Effect &s;o long as they march every Coun|try Troops back to their own Limits for Winter-Quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="262">
But the King of <HI>France</HI> has not contented him&s;elf with this Advantage; for on the Side of <HI>Piedmont</HI> he has done ju&s;t the &s;ame thing, taking from the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> the City of <HI>Nice</HI> and the Town of <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> the prin|cipal Port that Prince had on the Side of the Mediterranean Sea.</P>
<P>This Action was carried on with all that Secre&s;ie and Celerity which is peculiar to the <HI>French</HI> Conduct, and in which they are a Pat|tern to all that would pro&s;per in great Un|dertakings: Mon&s;ieur <HI>Catinat,</HI> a vigilant and fortunate General, commanded the Expediti|on; they began to draw the Troops together at <HI>Thoulon,</HI> and the general Rendezvouz was be|tween that Place and <HI>Grace,</HI> a Town on the River <HI>Vaar;</HI> they were all at the Place the 22<HI>d</HI> of <HI>February;</HI> but the March being difficult, they could not &s;it down before the Town till the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> which, however, was &s;o early in the Year, that no Troops but tho&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> who conquer all kinds of Difficulties, could pretend to take the Field.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Nice</HI> is &s;urrounded with Forts, Pa|lanques, and Fortifications, at a Di&s;tance from it, and on the particular Places which mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;|ed to come at it; as fir&s;t, <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> a Town about a League from <HI>Nice;</HI> &s;econdly, the Fort, called the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Villa Franca;</HI> thirdly, the Fort of St. <HI>Ho&s;pitio;</HI> fourthly, the Fort of <HI>Mont|alban,</HI> then the City of <HI>Nice;</HI> and la&s;tly, the Citadel; all the&s;e Places were fortified, and mo&s;t of them, e&s;pecially the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Villa Franca</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Montalban;</HI> yet by the 26<HI>th,</HI> in the Morning, the <HI>French</HI> had ma&s;ter'd them all, and &s;at down before the Citadel of <HI>Nice,</HI> having brought al&s;o a Squadron of Men
<PB N="244" REF="263">
of War to block up the Port by Sea, that no Relief might get in.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>Nice</HI> had the Fate of <HI>Belgrade;</HI> for a Bomb falling into a Magazine of Powder, blew it up with three other Magazines, killed 700 of the Garri&s;on, demoli&s;hed the be&s;t Part of the Fortifications, and frighted the Go|vernour and his remaining Part of the Garri|&s;on into an immediate Surrender.</P>
<P>Thus this King makes him&s;elf a Terror to the World; the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> is in a fair Way to be ruined, and they &s;ay is de&s;irous to make his Peace; whether that be true or no, Time will di&s;cover; but 'tis certain, if he does not, or is not immediately a&s;&s;i&s;ted in a power|ful manner by the Emperor, his De&s;truction is not far off; for the King of <HI>France</HI> re&s;elves to give Mon&s;ieur <HI>Catinat</HI> 50000 Men to reduce him at once, and make quick work of him; on the other hand, Mon&s;ieur the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> the King's Brother, who&s;e Daughter the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> has married, has &s;ent an Expre&s;s to <HI>Tu|rin,</HI> to inform his Son-in-Law of the Dangers that attend him, and to advi&s;e him to take &s;pee|dy Mea&s;ures to accommodate his Affairs with the King, offering his good Offices, at the &s;ame Time, to di&s;po&s;e his Maje&s;ty to his Intere&s;t; but it &s;eems the Duke is not &s;o apprehen&s;ive as others are, or has &s;ome &s;ecret Dependences which they are not informed of.</P>
<P>However, the King of <HI>France</HI> has, by the&s;e two Actions, &s;o anticipated the Glory of the next Campaign, that his Enemies have no|thing to do but to try if they can regain in the Summer what he has taken from them in the Spring, and he has nothing to do but to act upon the Defen&s;ive, if he plea&s;es, till they are di&s;pers'd again, and then they may
<PB N="245" REF="264">
expect him to fall upon them again ju&s;t as before.</P>
<P>I need not lay the&s;e things before thee as a Pattern, the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Affairs again&s;t the Infidel Nations manife&s;t that the Grand Vizier wants no Experience, Vigilance, Coun|cil for contriving, or Vigour for Execution of his glorious Attempts; may Glory and Vertue encrea&s;e his Fame, and may the Sultan our Lord, the inexhau&s;tible Source of Magnifi|cence and Lu&s;tre, lift up his Head above the Kings of the Earth, crowned with inconceiva|ble Glory, and the Light of an Hundred Thou&s;and Con&s;tellations.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. To <HI>Mahomed Elmaken,</HI> Student in Hi&s;tory in <HI>Trapezond.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF there is any thing to be gathered from outward Appearances, the De&s;olations Na|ture works upon her &s;elf with her own Hands mu&s;t be Tokens of the Anger of God upon the Nations; Nature is never lunatick, <HI>Non compos mentis,</HI> or &s;o out of her Wits, as in the Frenzy to lay violent Hands upon her &s;elf: If the Author of Nature does not lay his irre|&s;i&s;tible
<PB N="246" REF="265">
Commands upon her to do &s;o, for the Puni&s;hment of wicked Men.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that in violent Tempe&s;ts, Hur|ricans, or Tournadoes, Eruptions of Fire and Water, Earthquakes, and the like, Nature &s;eems <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> &s;he appears armed again&s;t her &s;elf, tearing her own Bowels, defacing her own beautiful Countenance, and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> acting all the Parts of a Man, who being de|mented by the Fury of a Di&s;ea&s;e, a Fever, or the like, lays violent Hands upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This has been a Year terrible in the <HI>Nazaren</HI> Nations for the&s;e things, and particularly for Earthquakes, of which there are &s;ome very af|frighting In&s;tances this Year. In <HI>Holland, France, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Great Britain;</HI> as near as can be gather|ed, the whole Body of the Earth felt a Jogg or two at the very &s;ame Moment of Time, which, tho' it did no harm, yet it put all the&s;e Parts of the World into a mo&s;t terrible Con&s;ternati|on.</P>
<P>But in <HI>America,</HI> they tell us dreadful Sto|ries; for Example, that in the Empire of <HI>Mexico,</HI> three and twenty Villages are over|whelm'd, with great Part of the Inhabitants, and a great Town called <HI>Truxillo,</HI> almo&s;t quite demoli&s;hed; that in <HI>Peru,</HI> a great Mountain &s;unk down into a plain Country, and a great Hill ro&s;e up out of a Lake.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t affrighting Story of all is, that of the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &s;cituated in the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and now a Colony of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who formerly took it from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> the principal Town or Port of this I&s;land was called <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and of that Town the prin|cipal Part was called the <HI>Point,</HI> being a Neck of Land running out into the Water like a
<PB N="247" REF="266">
Peir; this had upon it very fair Buildings, and the principal Merchants of the I&s;land re&s;ided there.</P>
<P>It was in the Middle of the Day, or rather a lit|tle before Noon, when, by a furious Earthquake, one whole Side of that Neck of Land I mention|ed, which they called the <HI>Point,</HI> &s;unk by a &s;udden and violent Earthquake, and the Build|ings having then no Foundation, &s;lid all down into the Sea; &s;o that above 2000 People were immediately &s;wallowed up, with their Habita|tions, Goods, and Effects.</P>
<P>The Calamity of this Country is not to be expre&s;s'd; for in the other Part of the I&s;land, where the Dwellings were not &s;wallow|ed up, the Earth for &s;everal Days moved &s;o violently, that the People could not &s;tand up|on it, even in the very Fields, but lying down, roll'd with it up and down the Earth like Ve&s;&s;els on the Sea, and you may be &s;ure they were all the while in the utmo&s;t Horror and Di&s;traction, expecting every Moment to be &s;wallowed up alive.</P>
<P>Certainly the Con&s;ternation mu&s;t be in|expre&s;&s;ible among the mi&s;erable Inhabi|tants; for it was a Calamity which they had never felt before in the Place: And &s;ince I am &s;peaking of Earthquakes, things which ve|ry rarely happen among the righteous Nations; it is not improper to give thee a brief hi&s;tori|cal Account of &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable Earthquakes which have happened in the&s;e <HI>Nazaren</HI> Parts of the World, where they are more frequent than in any other Places.</P>
<P>'Tis about Two Thou&s;and and Sixty &s;ix Years ago that there happened one in <HI>Achaia,</HI> which almo&s;t utterly de&s;troyed it; and which
<PB N="248" REF="267">
was attended with Inundations, which in the very Heart of <HI>Corinth</HI> delug'd the Cities of <HI>He|lice</HI> and <HI>Buris,</HI> of which <HI>Ovid</HI> makes mention in the 15<HI>th</HI> Book of his <HI>Metamorpho&s;is.</HI><Q><L>Si quaereas <HI>Helicen &amp; Burien,</HI> Achaeidas urbes,</L>

<P>The la&s;t Year of the Two Hundred and Seventieth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> the mo&s;t Part of the Build|ings of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon</HI> were overturn'd, and an infinite Number of People buried under their Ruines. The third Year of the 181 <HI>Olym|piad, Rome</HI> was &s;haken for three Days and three Nights together, and <HI>D rrachium</HI> was levell'd with the Ground, together with &s;everal Cities of <HI>Campania;</HI> nay, in our own Country I have read in the holy Writings of <HI>Aaiada,</HI> that in the Reign of <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. the mighty and mo&s;t invincible Emperor, there was an Earthquake at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that la&s;ted forty Days; and that during all that Time there was not an Hour pa&s;t but the City &s;uffer'd extraordinary Shocks; &s;o that the Grand Vizier, by the Grand Seignior's Command, employed Fore|&s;core Thou&s;and Workmen to repair the City, till by the Prayers of the Faithful, Re&s;t was obtained.</P>
<P>In the Year 1180, of the <HI>Nazaren</HI> Account, an Earthquake ruined a great Part of the City of <HI>Naples;</HI> that of <HI>Arian,</HI> a &s;maller City, was &s;wallowed up of the Sea, and &s;everal other Towns utterly overthrown in that Part of <HI>Italy</HI> called <HI>Calabria.</HI> In the Year 1456. there aro&s;e upon the Sea of <HI>Ancona,</HI> together with a
<PB N="249" REF="268">
thick gloomy Cloud that extended above two Miles, a Tempe&s;t of Wind, Water, Fire, Eightning, and Thunder, which piercing to the mo&s;t deep Aby&s;&s;es of the Sea, forc'd up the Waves with a mo&s;t dreadful Fury, and carried all before it upon the Land. This af|terwards cau&s;ed, as the Writers here te&s;tify, &s;o dreadful an Earthquake, that the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> was in a Manner quite ruined, and all <HI>Italy</HI> carried the di&s;mal Marks of it; a Million of Hou&s;es, Ca&s;tles, and Palaces were buried in their own Ruine; above thirty thou&s;and Peo|ple were cru&s;h'd to Pieces by their Weight, and a huge Mountain was overturn'd into the Lake <HI>de la Guarde,</HI> in the <HI>Milane&s;e. Jo&s;eph Aco&s;ta</HI> re|lates, that in <HI>Peru,</HI> the Year 1581 there happened an Earthquake which removed the City of <HI>Angua|quim</HI> two Leagues from the Place where it &s;tood, without demoli&s;hing it, in Regard the Scitu|ation of the whole Country was changed. And every Body has heard of the Earthquake which happened among the Mountains of the <HI>Alps,</HI> in a Place called the <HI>Valtoline,</HI> in the Year 1660. by the Violence of which a great Mountain near <HI>Bigorre,</HI> &s;unk down into the Earth, and was covered over with the Water of a Lake hard by; but the greate&s;t and mo&s;t dreadful Earthquake was that which divided. <HI>America,</HI> from <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> for we read in <HI>Plato</HI>'s <HI>Timaeus,</HI> that they talked in his Time of an I&s;land near the Pillars of <HI>Hercules</HI> that was call'd <HI>Atlantis,</HI> bigger than <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> both together, which, by a horrible Earthquake and a Deluge of twenty four Days, was &s;wal|lowed up and covered with the Sea, and ne|ver &s;een &s;ince, 500 Millions of People being de&s;troyed with it; and that the Sea, which
<PB N="250" REF="269">
&s;wallowed it up, has from thence been called the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean to this Day.</P>
<P>Some of the Ancients among the&s;e People have been of Opinion, that the Earth was a great Animal, and that the Shivering, occa|&s;ioned by &s;ome Di&s;temper not unlike that of an Ague-Fit, was the Cau&s;e of its trembling.

<P>The greate&s;t of the Heathen Philo&s;opher s accu&s;ed the Stars of the&s;e Di&s;orders upon the Earth, and &s;ome of them expo&s;tulated with the Gods very earne&s;tly on this Account; but to &s;peak one Word of the Cau&s;es of them in general, I &s;ay that there are two which are na|tural, and may very rationally be accounted for, and it is mo&s;t profitable to &s;peak of &s;uch, ra|ther than of imaginary Cau&s;es, 1. that the &s;ub|terranean Fires and Winds are the fir&s;t Cau&s;e; the Bowels of the Earth are full of bituminous Matter, &s;ulphurous, and nitrous Particles, Salt-Petre, and the like; and when it happens that one Stone, by &s;ecret Operation, falling upon another, &s;trikes Fire by Colli&s;ion, or that Air penetrates in unu&s;ual Quantities, tho&s;e combu&s;tible Matters being kindled, and the Winds blowing up the Flames, they cau&s;e mo&s;t terrible Overturnings of the Earth, unle&s;s they find Outlets, as in <HI>Etna, Ve&s;uvius,</HI> and other Mountains, who&s;e opening Tops give Vent to the Flame. The &s;econd natural Cau&s;e which I ob&s;erve, proceeds from the Water that is under the Earth, which undermining the Foundations that &s;upport the &s;ubterranean

Vaults, which extend them&s;elves for &s;everal Leagues together in &s;everal Parts.

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. To <HI>Simeon Ben. Habbakkuk,</HI> a <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Salonica.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have ju&s;t written at large to thy old Friend and mine <HI>Elmakem</HI> at <HI>Trapezond,</HI> with an Account of a very terrible Earthquake, which, they &s;ay, has happened at the I&s;land of <HI>Jamai|ca,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Engli&s;h Nazarens.</HI></P>
<P>It might be agreeable to thee to give thee an Account of the Particular, of this terrible thing; but thou art too familiarly acquainted with &s;uch things in the Country where thou live&s;t, to need any Information from me, one Circum&s;tance only I cannot omit, becau&s;e it re|lates to the People whom thou belonge&s;t to.</P>
<P>The Earthquake there, as the Relations which come from <HI>England,</HI> and al&s;o others from the <HI>French</HI> Colonies in tho&s;e Parts, particu|larly at <HI>Cuba, Martinico,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Part of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> give an Account was very terrible; and that in particular that after the fir&s;t Shock, which overthrew the capital Town of the I&s;land, for &s;everal Days the Earth rolled up and down like the Waves of the Sea, that in &s;undry Places great Cha&s;ma's appeared, the Earth parting, and leaving &s;everal Openings, gaping dreadfully to a frightful Depth.</P>
<P>That the poor People amaz'd and terrified to the la&s;t Extremity, lying in the open Fields, expected to be &s;wallowed up every Moment,
<PB N="253" REF="272">
and that &s;ome were even frighted to Death, anticipating Death it &s;elf with the Apprehen|&s;ions of it, and confirming that ju&s;t Notion, that the Fear of any Evil is greater than the Evil it &s;elf, like as the De&s;ire of any Good is far greater than the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I need not &s;pend Time to inform thee of that, who ha&s;t too ju&s;t Notions, and too large a Portion of Judgment not to know, that what is pre&s;ent affects the Sen&s;es in a quite differing manner from what is to come; what is pre&s;ent to us is &s;een in its genuine Form, but what is di&s;tant and repre&s;ented only by the Pa&s;&s;ions, as by Fear or De&s;ire, is mag|nified to an infinite Degree, as tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions get the Victory over our Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But what Apprehen&s;ions of Death, or ra|ther of the World after Death produced the Effect I am going to relate to thee, that I know not, and leave to thee; but the Fact is thus, I am a&s;&s;ured that the <HI>Jews,</HI> for there are a great many Families of thy Nation in that I&s;land, I &s;ay the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the Extremity of the Terror they were in, upon Occa&s;ion of this Earthquake, called upon Je&s;us the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>I have no Room to que&s;tion the Truth of the Fact; becau&s;e divers <HI>Jews</HI> here have not only heard of it, but do approve and ju&s;ti|fie the Relation.</P>
<P>If the Mu&s;&s;ulmans, who acknowledge Je&s;us to be the Me&s;&s;iah, and that he was a Prophet &s;er from God, as we acknowledge <HI>Mahomet</HI> al&s;o to be, had in &s;uch a Calamity called up|on any of the Prophets, and upon Je&s;us al&s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in that Extremity, it might have been &s;aid, it was becau&s;e we do believe him to have been a ju&s;t Man, and that he was

<HEAD>LETTER I. To the Selictar-Aga, or chief Sword-Bearer.</HEAD>
<P>_I Was ordered by <HI>I&s;uff Ba&s;&s;a Reis Eff'endi,</HI> in ca&s;e of his being gone a Journey to <HI>Bagdat,</HI> to negotiate a Peace with the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as I find he is, to write to thee what I had purpo&s;ed to &s;ay of the Affairs of the&s;e Parts of the World; it is always of Importance for the principal Secretaries, prime Mini&s;ters, State&s;|men, and Managers in the Court of our illu|&s;trious Ma&s;ter, to know the minute&s;t Matters relating to Government, to Peace, and to War; how much more then the important
<PB N="258" REF="276">
Affairs in the Court of the greate&s;t King in the&s;e Parts of the World, who&s;e Actions none can imitate, who&s;e Glory is only out&s;hin'd by the Mirror of &s;uperior Glory, the Lu&s;tre of the &s;ublime, the ever great and re&s;plendent Grand Seignior, who&s;e Days be happy, and his ri&s;ing every Morning victorious?</P>
<P>If one may gue&s;s by the encrea&s;ing Power of the King of <HI>France,</HI> by his Vigilance and Appli|cation to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well of War as of Government; if one may calculate from the immen&s;e Trea&s;ures he lays up, the Numbers of his Armies, the Vigor of his Councils, the Experience and Bravery of his Generals, the early Motion of his Troops, and from the Pro|gre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his Arms the la&s;t Year, it would inti|mate that this mu&s;t be a Year of Wonders.</P>
<P>It is true, that the King of <HI>England</HI> is a re|&s;plendent Star, encrea&s;ing in Magnitude; a Prince, who&s;e martial Genius fills the World with Expectations, gives Vigor and Spirit to the Soldiery, is the Life of the Confederacy, and is not to be di&s;couraged by the greate&s;t Repul&s;es; but &s;till he ama&s;&s;es Troops, rai&s;es new Armies, encrea&s;es the Numbers of his Confederates, and cau&s;es every Day new Ene|mies to ri&s;e up to the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But the King of <HI>France</HI> bullies them all, and appears equal to their greate&s;t De&s;igns, &s;upe|rior to them in Numbers, and above all, &s;u|perior in the exqui&s;ite Admini&s;tration of all his Affairs, as well Civil as Military</P>
<P>Men always believed the King of <HI>France</HI> would outdo the ancient Giants in the de&s;pe|rate Efforts of the pre&s;ent War; nay, con&s;ider|ing who he has to engage with, it mu&s;t be &s;o, or he mu&s;t fall under the Weight of &s;o ma|ny Enemies; but it was thought al&s;o that his
<PB N="259" REF="277">
Trea&s;ure would fail him before his Troops, and that he mu&s;t be at la&s;t exhau&s;ted and en|feebled that way.</P>
<P>But he di&s;appoints them all that way too; for he finds &s;uch ways to rai&s;e Money, and that in &s;uch immen&s;e Quantity, that 'tis almo&s;t incredible; his Enemies boa&s;t that he rai&s;es it with Difficulty, which indeed is true; but what is that to their Purpo&s;e? &s;eeing difficult or not difficult, he does rai&s;e the Money. Indeed &s;uch is his Skill to direct his Demands of Mo|ney, and his ab&s;olute Power to enforce tho&s;e Demands, that his Officers will tear it out of the Bowels of the People, &s;o long as there is any Silver in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>When I look on the Application of this Court to rai&s;e Money, how inten&s;e upon it, and how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it is to them to have it; I have wondred they have not thought of empting the wonderful Lake of <HI>Thoulou&s;e.</HI> This is a great &s;tanding Pool of Water near the City of <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> into which, they tell us, that the ancient <HI>Gauls,</HI> after they had &s;ack'd the Temple of <HI>Delphos,</HI> threw an Hundred and Ten Thou&s;and Pound Weight of Gold, and five Millions of Pounds Weight of Silver, on its being &s;ugge&s;ted that it was &s;a|crilegious Wealth, and that the Gods were an|gry with them. 'Tis true, that <HI>Cepio,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;ul, got up a great deal of it &s;ome Ages after|wards, and carried it away; but a modern Geo|grapher of this Place tells us, there is a great deal &s;till left, which the People of <HI>Thoulou&s;e</HI> would fain have been fingering, but that they were &s;till frighted with Devils and Mon&s;ters of all kinds; now the King of <HI>France,</HI> who has &s;o many Dragoons, that fear neither God nor the Devil, might ea&s;ily make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter
<PB N="260" REF="278">
of it; or if this failed, one would think that all the &s;acred Reliques in <HI>France</HI> &s;hould turn to a va&s;t Account; he had better &s;ell them than &s;queeze out the very Heart-Blood of his Subjects; there's half St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Beard</HI> at <HI>Poitiers,</HI> would be worth to him half a Million of Money; and the Shrines of the Apo&s;tles at St. <HI>Stephens</HI> in <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> would &s;uffice to furni&s;h him for &s;even Years together. But this by the way.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> has not only very ex|qui&s;ite Methods of rai&s;ing Money, but the Oeconomy of his Government is &s;uch, that when it is rai&s;ed, it is always applied to the proper U&s;es; we never hear of Embezzlements and Mi&s;application among his Finnanciers or Trea&s;urers; and by this punctual Management of his Trea&s;ure, he has this Advantage, that his Troops are always in the Field before his Enemies, let them make the utmo&s;t Speed they can.</P>
<P>This he threatens them with on all Hands this Year, and tho' I am now writing to thee but in the &s;econd Moon, we &s;ee already his Cavalry new mounted, his Hou&s;hold Troops new clothed, his Recruits di&s;tributed, and mo&s;t of his Armies in a Condition to march, while &s;ome of the Confederates are little more than got home into their Winter-Quar|ters; and I am mi&s;taken if we do not &s;ee him give them &s;ome con&s;iderable Blow before they can get into the Field.</P>
<P>Every Year he encrea&s;es his Troops, and it is &s;aid that this Year he adds &s;ixty Thou&s;and Men to his Armies, be&s;ides a prodigious Num|ber wanting to recruit his old Regiments; ex|pect therefore I &s;hall in a little while &s;end the News of &s;ome <HI>Coup de Eclat</HI> on this Side.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. To the Grand Mufti.</HEAD>
<P>I Once gave a brief Recapitulation of the Hi&s;tory of Earthquakes to thy holy Slave <HI>Elmakem</HI> at <HI>Trapezond;</HI> my Letter was occa&s;ion'd by looking back with Horror and Regret on the Convul&s;ions of Nature, which I have lately met with of that kind, particularly &s;ome re|markable and dreadful Ca&s;ualties which have happened in the&s;e few Years time in the&s;e Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Here is now a new and mo&s;t dreadful Re|turn of this particular kind happened in <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Sicily.</HI> I intimated in my Letter to <HI>Elmakem</HI> how the&s;e kinds of God's Judgments &s;eem peculiar to the&s;e Countries: Thou wilt &s;ay &s;o too when thou &s;hall hear the following Story, which is ju&s;t now come to Hand: It was the Ninth of the Fir&s;t Moon, about Four of the Clock in the Morning, that a terrible Farthquake was felt at the City of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> in <HI>Sicily:</HI> The Protection of <HI>Mahomet</HI> be upon every true Mu&s;&s;ulman; for certainly the like of this Earthquake was never heard of; e&s;pecially in &s;ome of the mo&s;t dreadful Parts of it, of which &s;uch undoubted Authorities are brought, that there is no Room to que&s;tion the Truth. Take the Heads of it as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI> At fir&s;t it did no Damage, only that it &s;hook the whole City in a mo&s;t frightful Manner, and terrified the People mo&s;t &s;trangely: the greate&s;t Part of them fled to the Fields, the
<PB N="263" REF="281">
re&s;t run to the Mo&s;chs, to make their Pray|ers; however, in about three Hours it went off for that Time: But the third Day after, it returned with &s;uch Fury, that the whole City was terribly &s;hatter'd, the Violence of the Shock in a Moment overturn'd Four and Twenty Palaces, and endanger'd all the re&s;t of the Buildings; all the People throng'd to the <HI>Dome,</HI> that is the chief Mo&s;ch, where the Arch|bi&s;hop preached, and gave that provoking In|&s;ult upon the One God, called ABSOLUTI|ON; as did al&s;o, &s;uch is their Delu&s;ion here, a great Number of their Dervices, di&s;pers'd for that Purpo&s;e into all the Quarters of the City. After this every Body thought of no|thing el&s;e but e&s;caping from the Danger, by re|tiring into the Country; tho&s;e who could &s;et up Tents were &s;afe from the Injuries of the Wea|ther: But many of the others were de&s;troyed; the Air being all on a Flame by Rea&s;on of a mo&s;t terrible Thunder and continual Fla&s;hes of Lightning: But this is but the lea&s;t Part of this Story; for notwith&s;tanding the great Damages done to this City, it was no|thing to what many others received; the Towns of <HI>Faormina, Ma&s;eal, Madica,</HI> the Cities of <HI>Agou&s;ta, Catanea, Syracu&s;e, Carlentino,</HI> and &s;everal other con&s;iderable Cities, Towns, and Provinces, are utterly ruined. <HI>Agou&s;ta</HI> is become a meer Lake, by Rea&s;on of a Rupture which the Sea made into that Part where the Hou&s;es &s;tood, while at the &s;ame Time the Lightning fla&s;hing into the Fortre&s;s of the City, blew it up into the Air. <HI>Catanea</HI> was utterly overturned, and Six|teen Thou&s;and Per&s;ons were buried under the Ruins of the great Mo&s;ch only; the 18<HI>th</HI> and 19<HI>th,</HI> two fre&s;h Jolts gave new Alarms, but with|out Damage.

<PB N="264" REF="282">
&s;urpri&s;ing; but I have not yet the Particulars; all that is known at pre&s;ent is, that the Palace Royal is quite overturn'd, and the Vice-Roy had much a-do to e&s;cape to the Galleys; it may be truly &s;aid, that <HI>Sicily</HI> is utterly laid wa&s;te, as al&s;o the lower <HI>Calabria,</HI> being a Country in the Southermo&s;t Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> 'Tis thought that above a Hundred Thou&s;and Per&s;ons are de&s;troyed in this di&s;mal Calamity, be&s;ides above Twen|ty Thou&s;and wounded</P>
<P>With this I mu&s;t inform thee a little of the Wickedne&s;s of the audacious Prie&s;ts in that Country on this Occa&s;ion in particular, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that as <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> received le&s;s Damage than the other Cities, and for that the People in that Country are very &s;uper&s;titious, the Monks, who under|&s;tand how to make their Advantages of the Simplicity of the Country-People, &s;pread a|broad a Report at the Time of the Earth|quake, that the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, <HI>&s;o they call Mary the Mother of the Prophet Je&s;us,</HI> had revealed to a young Girl of Nine Years of Age in that Ci|ty, who was her particular Favourite, that by Means of her Interce&s;&s;ion &s;he had obtain|ed that the City of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> which is under her Protection, &s;hould not be de&s;troyed in the common Calamity with the re&s;t, and this has cau&s;ed a Thou&s;and idolatrous Extravagances among them, in Gratitude to this Woman; they have dre&s;t up her Effigie or Image in all the Mo&s;chs, deck'd with Jewels of an ine&s;ti|mable Value; they put a Crown upon her Head, and impiou&s;ly call her <HI>Queen of Heaven;</HI> and all the City, old and young, flow into the Temples to &s;ay their Prayers to her.</P>

<P>I frequently talk to them of this Woman <HI>Mary,</HI> and grant to them &s;he was highly ho|noured in being the Mother of their Prophet; but I challenge them to &s;hew me one Word in all the In&s;titutions, even of their Prophet him&s;elf, directing his Di&s;ciples to wor&s;hip her, or empowering her to any Part of the Office of an Interce&s;&s;or in Heaven, much le&s;s crown|ing her as a Queen, who was her &s;elf a poor humble Wife to a mean, and a laborious Me|chanick; but they grow angry, and cro&s;s them|&s;elves, as if they &s;aw the Devil when I talk thus, and calling me Hugonot, tell me, if I was in <HI>Italy,</HI> I &s;hould be &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition; &s;o I talk of &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>But to return to the Story: The Citizens of <HI>Catanea</HI> found, to their Co&s;t, the Impotence of the like Church-Pageantry; for tho' the Dervices there, brought forth the Image of St. <HI>Agatha,</HI> another old Woman, who they have made an Idol of too, and who they call Patrone&s;s of that City, and that many Thou|&s;and of the poor frighted People fled after her to the great Mo&s;que or Cathedral, grovel|ling on the Ground on their Hands and Knees to their Saint; yet they were all involv'd in the general De&s;truction; for the whole Cathedral being tran&s;vers'd by the Earthquake, the poor Votaries, with their Saint, were buried in the Ruines of that very Church they fled to for Safety.

<HEAD>LETTER III. To <HI>Ha&s;&s;an El Abmenzai,</HI> Steward to the Sultanne&s;s <HI>Alfaraiza.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is the Sum of humane Mi&s;ery to have no Body to communicate our Joys and Griefs with: The Heart is not able to con|tain its own Exce&s;&s;es, but they will break out; and if we have not a Friend to unburthen the Soul to, it will di&s;cover its Burthen in every Line of the Countenance.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Nathan</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> furni&s;h'd me with an Equivalent for this Violence of the Mind,
<PB N="267" REF="285">
which was a kind of a Charm, repeating a cer|tain Number of Words in (a Corruption of) the <HI>Syriac</HI> Tongue, and then to tell my whole Story with my Face towards the Sun, as if I were talking to a particular Friend.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e things have appeared empty Shadows to me, and my Heart has been ready to bur&s;t for the&s;e thirteen Moons pa&s;t, with the violent Agitations of Joy and De&s;pair, re|volving in their Turns, equally &s;trong and equally un&s;upportable.</P>
<P>It was next to impo&s;&s;ible for me to conceal the Tran&s;ports of my Soul, when I had, by three &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es from the Port, the mo&s;t comforting agreeable News, that the Grand Seignior, the Lord of benign and heavenly Council, the merciful Rewarder of his faith|ful Slaves, had heard my repeated Prayers, and had granted me licence to return to the Graves of my Fathers, and to clo&s;e an Age of Mi&s;ery and Retirement with the Con&s;olation of the Faithful, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to die at the Feet of our great Prophet, ki&s;&s;ing the Steps of his Tomb, and the Du&s;t of the Feet of ten Millions of Pilgrims.</P>
<P>This happy News was &s;econded by ano|ther no le&s;s agreeable, from the <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> wherein he congratulates my compleating my De&s;ires, and gives me the Name of my Suc|ce&s;&s;or, <HI>viz.) Ali Mezzawar</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cas,</HI> my old Friend and Acquaintance, who has for many Years re&s;ided, for the Service of the illu&s;trious Port, among the reconciled Rebels of <HI>Algier.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that this happy News made glad my Heart, I received Letters from <HI>Ali</HI> him&s;elf, to whom a Chaioux had been &s;ent, with Orders to him to repair to <HI>Paris,</HI> intimating how readily he would obey
<PB N="268" REF="286">
tho&s;e Orders, and that he was ju&s;t taking Ship for <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> in order to come to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Judge you, my Friend, how &s;urprizing all the&s;e good Tidings were to a Soul ready al|mo&s;t to fly out of its Pri&s;on at the fir&s;t Ac|count of it, and who had lived eleven Moons in the mo&s;t perfect State of Satisfaction that it was po&s;&s;ible for me to repre&s;ent to my &s;elf in the World, in&s;omuch that I fed, as it were, upon the Air of Expectation, with a Mind &s;a|tisfied even to a Surfeit of Contentment.</P>
<P>Nay, as if Fate intended to &s;port with my Misfortunes, and I was &s;till to be made more mi&s;erable than any Man was before me, I was &s;till lifted up higher, to add to the Weight of my Fall, and to da&s;h me utterly in pieces by the Force of it. In a Word, my Deliverer arriv'd, and I received a Letter from him, da|ted at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where he landed, a&s;&s;uring me that he lo&s;t no Time to come forward, and promi&s;ed him&s;elf a &s;ingular Plea&s;ure in di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing me, and &s;etting me at full Liberty for my Return.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that all this could be an <HI>Ignis fatuus,</HI> to en&s;nare my Mind, and plunge me in the deepe&s;t De&s;pair; was there any thing now but the &s;ingle Hazard of Mortality between me and my Deliverance? who would not have looked upon him&s;elf as a Freeman, and have begun to tru&s;s up his Baggage to depart?</P>
<P>But &s;ee the Product of &s;urprizing Decrees, the next Letter I received was from <HI>Chalons,</HI> where my dear Friend was taken &s;ick, and &s;ent an Expre&s;s, a faithful Me&s;&s;enger, to de&s;ire me to come to him thither, for that he was dange|rou&s;ly ill.</P>
<P>It was with a Surprize of Grief, that I re|ceived this Account, and immediately I po&s;t|ed
<PB N="269" REF="287">
to <HI>Chalons;</HI> but it was with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Sorrow, that when I came to him he had but ju&s;t Life left in him enough to know me, and being not able to &s;peak, expired in my Arms.</P>
<P>Thus all my Comforts are bla&s;ted at once, and the Hopes I had entertained of being &s;ee free from the dicon&s;olate Circum&s;tances I am in, are entirely cut off.</P>
<P>It was with great Secrecy that I cau&s;ed his Body to be wa&s;hed with clean Water, and having hired a Carriage, which they call here a Hear&s;e, I embalmed the Corps, and cau&s;ed it to be put into a Coffin of Lead, and went away with it as travelling for <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>When I came upon the Road to a Place where the Ways parted, &s;loaping one towards the Right, and the other towards the Left, I di&s;charged the Hear&s;e and its Attendance, ha|ving told them, that another Hear&s;e was to meet me there, and &s;o &s;etting the Coffin upon the Ground, they went their Way. Here, with a ju&s;t Solemnity of Tears, I buried my decea&s;ed Friend, laying the Coffin on one Side with his Face towards the &s;acred Repo&s;itory at <HI>Mecca,</HI> that he may awake again with his Eyes direct|ly again&s;t the golden Gate at the Entrance in|to Paradi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. To the Mufti.</HEAD>
<P>THESE <HI>Nazarens</HI> are the mo&s;t addicted to Fiction and Forgery of any People that ever I met with; it is a received Cu|&s;tom among them, that whenever they have to do with any Sect or Opinion of People, differing from their own, the fir&s;t thing they go about is, to repre&s;ent them as mon&s;trous and unnatural, either in Per&s;on or in Princi|ple, or perhaps in both; dre&s;&s;ing them up in ridiculous Shapes, and impo&s;ing a Thou&s;and Stories about them upon the Credulity and Ignorance of the Vulgar, that they may en|tertain immoveable Prejudices and Aver&s;ions again&s;t the Per&s;ons and Principles they pro|fe&s;s.</P>
<P>It would amaze thee, illu&s;trious Prince of Wi&s;dom, to hear what ab&s;urd romantick Tales, what imaginary Hi&s;tories, and what innumera|ble forged Stories, they tell of our &s;ublime
<PB N="271" REF="289">
Prophet <HI>Mahomet;</HI> in what Colours they repre|&s;ent him, and the &s;acred In&s;titutions of our Law, which we are &s;atisfied were handed from Heaven to us by his Mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>What fabulous Miracles they mu&s;ter up to be pretended by him; how he u&s;ed Sorcery and Witchcraft, and feigned the In&s;piration of the Spirit of God by the Help of a Pidgeon; how his Tomb, in which is his Coffin, hangs &s;u&s;pend|ed in the Air between Heaven and Earth; and what &s;trange In&s;pirations and Agitations he was repre&s;ented by to his Followers; all which the true Mu&s;&s;ulmans di&s;own, and take no Notice of.</P>
<P>We have a famous In&s;tance of this ju&s;t now among them&s;elves in the Court of their horri|ble Inqui&s;ition, where they dre&s;s the People up whom they determine to the Flames, in Coats painted all over with Devils and tor|menting Spirits, to fill the Minds of the People with Horror and Dete&s;tation at the poor Vi|ctims; determining them to be Enemies to God and his Church, hating and abhorring them as &s;uch, without enquiring into any thing of which they are accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is another Example of their Inju&s;tice in the Story of Father <HI>Molinos,</HI> a Dervice of great Fame among them, and who they call the Quieti&s;t; becau&s;e he placed the Sum of Religion in the &s;ecret Contemplations of the great One God, and declared again&s;t the Pa|geantry of Wor&s;hip with which the <HI>Nazarens</HI> abound.</P>
<P>I cou'd not doubt but thou would&s;t be plea|&s;ed with &s;ome Account of this extraordinary Man, of his Principles, and of his End, which has been in the Pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition, where he was condemn'd to remain during
<PB N="272" REF="290">
Life; his Name was <HI>Michael de Molinos,</HI> a <HI>Spa|niard</HI> by Birth, and of a very good Family and Fortune</P>
<P>He betook him&s;elf to &s;tudy from his Youth, wrote &s;everal Books before he commenc'd a Dervice or Prie&s;t. In the Year 1625. he pub|li&s;h'd one of the&s;e Books under the Title of the <HI>&s;piritual Guide,</HI> which won him the E&s;teem of &s;everal Cardinals, or &s;uch as afterwards were made Cardinals; as the Cardinals <HI>Coloredo, At|tieri, Petrucii,</HI> (the la&s;t of which <HI>Molinos</HI> call'd his <HI>Tomotheus</HI>) <HI>Ca&s;&s;anata, Azolini,</HI> and <HI>Carpegna,</HI> together with Cardinal <HI>d'E&s;trees,</HI> who, of all the re&s;t, was he who mo&s;t familiarly vi&s;ited him, and &s;hew'd him mo&s;t Affection, and Ten|derne&s;s; but at la&s;t betrayed him. This Book he wrote argues very &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t <HI>Pen|nances, Mortifications, Vi&s;ions, Exta&s;ies, vocal Prayers,</HI> the Abu&s;es of Confe&s;&s;ion, and the In&s;ipidne&s;s of Catholick Sermons and Books; and, in a Word, again&s;t all their eccle&s;ia&s;tick Frippery, by which they carry on the Cheat of their Re|ligion at <HI>Rome</HI> among the People, and from whence they &s;pread the Fraud over the World.</P>
<P>The next Year Cardinal <HI>Ode&s;chalchi</HI> being created Pope, under the Name of <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. was no &s;ooner in&s;tall'd, but he gave apparent Marks of his Friend&s;hip to <HI>Molinos,</HI> by open Familiarity with him, lodging him in the <HI>Va|tican,</HI> and conver&s;ing with him on Affairs of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence, which acquir'd him the Re&s;pect of all Men; and his Method was &s;o applauded at <HI>Rome,</HI> that except the Je&s;uits, the mo&s;t Part of the Confe&s;&s;ors followed it, and cau&s;ed their Penitents to quit their Ro&s;a|ries, and betake them&s;elves to mental Prayers, and a contemplative Life. Cardinal <HI>d'E&s;trees</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="291">
al&s;o, that he might contribute to the Propa|gation of this Doctrine, cau&s;ed to be tran&s;la|ted out of <HI>French</HI> into <HI>Italian</HI> a certain Book, entitul'd, <HI>An ea&s;ie way to rai&s;e a Soul to Contem|plation;</HI> and at the &s;ame Time Father <HI>Petruci?</HI> publi&s;h'd &s;everal Letters, and &s;ome Treati&s;es upon the &s;ame Subject. If ever there was any real Danger that the <HI>Nazarens</HI> &s;hould return to the fir&s;t Principles of their Prophet Je&s;us, and wor&s;hip God in the Spirit; if ever the Fraud of Popes and Cardinals was in a way to be effectually overthrown; in a Word, if ever the Popes and popi&s;h Tribe were like to turn Hu|gonots, now was the Time; but the Je&s;uits, who were too cunning not to &s;ee the Dan|ger, and to ward off the Blow, finding the new Doctrine of <HI>Molinos</HI> get Ground, and that all People for&s;ook the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ionals,</HI> thought it Time to lay about them; and therefore taking the Alarm, in behalf of Religion, they fir&s;t branded <HI>Molinos</HI> for a Heretick, and accu&s;ed him for denying the Trinity, &s;o they call their Doctrine of three Per&s;ons or as we call it, of three Gods; maliciou&s;ly inferring, that his Maxims tended to the de&s;troying the Humanity of their Prophet Je&s;us; they likewi&s;e insinuated, that he was an Enemy to Prayer, becau&s;e he affirmed, <HI>that the Perfection of the Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">i&s;ted not in &s;peaking, nor in thinking of God, but in the lo|ving him after an extraordinary Manner&punc;</HI> They accu&s;ed him that he made all Chri&s;tians in|different, becau&s;e he adds, <HI>that Men ought not to di&s;turb them&s;elves when they fall into any Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion; but to make their Advantage of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> This was occa&s;ioned by a Prayer which he calls a Prayer of <HI>Quietude,</HI> and the Maxim they called Here&s;ie, is now called <HI>Quieti&s;m.</HI> The&s;e Accu|&s;ations,

and &s;ome others, made &s;uch a Noi&s;e, that the Inqui&s;ition took Cognizance of 'em; but the Office for that Time found nothing blame-worthy in <HI>Molinos,</HI> or in his Doctrine; be&s;ides, the Pope gave a Bi&s;hoprick to Father <HI>Petrucii,</HI> who was one of <HI>Molinos</HI>'s mo&s;t zea|lous Di&s;ciples. This put the Je&s;uits almo&s;t out of their Wits; &s;o that they cau&s;ed a Re|port to be whi&s;per'd about, that the Bi&s;hop being a <HI>Spainard,</HI> he might as well be of the Race of the <HI>Jews;</HI> but this did not hinder the Num|ber of the <HI>Quieti&s;ts</HI> from encrea&s;ing every Day.</P>
<P>However, as I &s;aid above, the Cardinal <HI>de E&s;trees</HI> influenced, it &s;eems, from hence; for the Je&s;uits have all the Power here in <HI>France,</HI> betray|ed him, and from his greate&s;t Friend, became his Accu&s;er and Enemy, and left not till he got him into the Pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition, where he ended his Days; for it is no ea&s;ie thing for any Man to get out of &s;uch Hands, when he is once abandon'd of his Protectors, let his Quality be what it will, or his Inno|cence ever &s;o clear.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. To the Grand Vizier.</HEAD>
<P>THE Devil mu&s;t certainly deal with the <HI>French</HI> Kings Generals, whether the <HI>French</HI> King deals with the Devil or no, that I cannot tell. It is true, his new great General, the Duke of <HI>Luxemberg,</HI> of whom I am now to &s;peak, has been charg'd with it, and many Ac|counts have been made publick about his be|ing a Sorcerer, that he was invulnerable, and that the Devil had engaged to keep him free from Sword and Gun for a certain Term of Years.</P>
<P>I do not affirm the&s;e things; but as it is cer|tainly true, that the <HI>Nazarens</HI> have &s;ome Peo|ple among them &s;o abandon'd of Heaven, as to enter into &s;ecret Compacts with Hell, what Wonder if tho&s;e, who are already deluded into Infidelity, &s;hould be capable of the Extremes of all Delu&s;ions, and outdo tho&s;e Nations in Wickedne&s;s who never heard of a divine Law, or a &s;overeign divine Being.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="294">
But to return to the Duke of <HI>Luxemberg,</HI> they do not indeed &s;tick to &s;ay here, that he is a Witch or Wizard, and that he has a &s;ecret in|fernal Corre&s;pondence; but they do not &s;ay that he is any forwarder for that to expo&s;e him|&s;elf to Sword or Gun, or to venture his Fle&s;h farther than other Generals when he comes to Action.</P>
<P>But he does the greate&s;t things in the Field, and is &s;o much ma&s;ter of Fortune, that the amaz'd People &s;tand and look on with Sur|prize, and &s;ay, he deals with the Devil. He has now given the greate&s;t Blow to the Con|federates that ever they have yet received, and, contrary to the Expectations of all the World, has fir&s;t drawn the confederate Army into that irrecoverable Over&s;ight of dividing their Army, and then forcing them to fight with an Inequality of Forces.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England,</HI> who is now very ju&s;t|ly e&s;teemed the greate&s;t General the Confede|rates have, has been always forward to bring the <HI>French</HI> to a Battle; eager to fight, but vigi|lant not to be taken at an Advantage; but however vigilant, he was, the Duke, has over|reached him: The two Armies lay encamp'd upon the little <HI>Mehaign,</HI> a River on that Side of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> next to <HI>Namure,</HI> their Numbers about 70000 Men on a Side, not much odds on one Side or other.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> General having taken <HI>Huy</HI> before the Confederates could come up to relieve it, made evident Shews of attacking the City of <HI>Liege,</HI> where there was a Garri&s;on; but as the Place was large, and not capable of Defence, the King of <HI>England</HI> &s;ent away, in &s;everal Detach|ments, about 16 Battallions of Men, with Orders to encamp under the Cannon of the Town, and
<PB N="277" REF="295">
fortifie them&s;elves, which they did &s;o &s;trong|ly as not to be attack'd, but in the Forms of a Siege: The Duke made &s;hew of falling up|on them with his whole Army, and in the mean time the Mare&s;chal <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> lay with a Body of 11000 Men as a flying Camp, po&s;ted at a Di&s;tance from the Army towards <HI>Huy;</HI> and this obliged the King of <HI>England</HI> al&s;o to make another &s;trong Detachment to watch his Motions.</P>
<P>The&s;e Detachments reduced the Confederate Army to about 52000 Men; the D. of <HI>Luxemberg</HI> taking hold of this Advantage faces about with his whole Army, at the &s;ame Time giving &s;ecret Or|ders to the Mare&s;. <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> to decamp with all po&s;&s;ible Secrecy with his Cavalry only, which were 32 Squadrons, and join him, which he perform'd &s;o well, as to come up in the Heat of the Battle, while the other Body &s;ent to ob&s;erve him knew nothing of his March.</P>
<P>Thus every thing con&s;pir'd to give the <HI>French</HI> the Advantage: The confederate Army, tho' inferior in Number, was compo&s;ed of &s;ome of the choice&s;t Troops in tho&s;e Parts of the World, pick'd &s;elect Regiments out of all the Nations concern'd, and led on by the greate&s;t Generals they had, &s;uch as the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> whom the World now calls King of <HI>England,</HI> tho' we do not here give him that Title; a Prince who&s;e Courage and Gal|lantry they &s;peak very well of here, tho' they hate his Per&s;on; al&s;o the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was there, and a World of Princes and Noblemen of all the Nations concern'd in the War.</P>
<P>They had about half a Day's Notice of the Battle, and &s;ome blam'd the King that he did not retreat, but in Truth he had not Time; for the <HI>French</HI> would have been upon him be|fore
<PB N="278" REF="296">
it had been po&s;&s;ible to have carried off his Cannon and Baggage, and would have put all in Confu&s;ion; &s;o he re&s;olved to fight.</P>
<P>Nothing more &s;urpriz'd the <HI>French,</HI> than to find, that when they view'd the Confederate-Army over Night, they &s;aw them drawn up in Battalia in the open Field; but in the Morning, when the Fight was to begin, found them entrench'd up to the Teeth, with a re|gular Parapet in Front, and in a Po&s;ture not to be attack'd without infinite Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Then it was that the Duke was advi&s;ed to retire, and give it over; but he was gone too far to retreat with Honour, and re&s;olved to attack them co&s;t what it would.</P>
<P>Never was a more terrible Fight; 'tis in vain to de&s;cribe it to thee, it would take up a Book, not a Letter. The Attacks were &s;o fu|rious, the Defence &s;o re&s;olute and ob&s;tinate, that nothing that is humane can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do more; the <HI>French</HI> found every Avenue &s;o guarded, every Regiment &s;o well po&s;ted, &s;econded and &s;upported, that they &s;aw it im|po&s;&s;ible to penetrate any where but in one Village, and there the Flower of the Confede|rate-Troops were po&s;ted; &s;o that the Re&s;i&s;tance was terrible.</P>
<P>They attack'd this Village with &s;uch Fury, that they drove out or cut in pieces all the Troops po&s;ted there; but in a Moment fre&s;h Troops attack'd them again, and drove them out with the &s;ame Fury and Slaughter.</P>
<P>Judge, illu&s;trious <HI>Ali,</HI> thou who ha&s;t &s;een the mo&s;t bloody Attacks, and the mo&s;t ob&s;ti|nate Defences at <HI>Bude, Belgrade,</HI> and all the other great Actions of the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where thou &s;o often ha&s;t repell'd the Fury of the <HI>Germans,</HI> to their Confu&s;ion; judge what
<PB N="279" REF="297">
Slaughter mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence of taking and lo&s;ing this Village three times in this Manner in the Space of about five Hours.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Duke of <HI>Luxemberg</HI> putting the Sum of the whole Battle upon this one Action, came on the third Time, and carried the Vil|lage, &s;uccouring his Troops &s;o well, and &s;up|porting them with &s;uch Numbers, that they could not be di&s;lodg'd; and when the King of <HI>England</HI> would have attack'd them again, he found &s;ome of his be&s;t Troops &s;o di&s;couraged by the Danger of the Service, that they did not do their Duty, nay, as it is &s;aid, refu&s;ed to march.</P>
<P>Upon breaking in here, the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> pre&s;s'd the King to give it over, who was him|&s;elf leading up his own Guards, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> to drive the <HI>French</HI> back; but the Duke a&s;&s;uring the King that the <HI>French</HI> had entered &s;o many Troops that it was impo&s;&s;ible to re|move them, prevailed on him, with much Difficulty, to make a Retreat before the Troops were pu&s;h'd into Di&s;order; upon which the King immediately ordered the left Wing of his Army to draw off, and with his u&s;ual Pre&s;ence of Mind made a de&s;perate Stand in the Rear till they were quite clear off the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>But his Right had not &s;uch good luck; for the <HI>French</HI> having driven them from their Po&s;ts, and having form'd them&s;elves in two Lines within the Entrenchments, no &s;ooner &s;aw them begin their Retreat, but they attack'd them with &s;uch Vigour, that they put them into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion; e&s;pecially the Cavalry, who coming to a little River, which was in their Rear, called the <HI>Geet,</HI> and the Bridges not be|ing able to receive them, they tumbled into
<PB N="280" REF="298">
it one over another, that tho' there was &s;carce Water enough to drown them, they were ra|ther &s;tifled in the Mud with the Weight of one another, than drowned in the Water.</P>
<P>Several whole Squadrons &s;eeing the Con&s;e|quence of attempting to pa&s;s the River, cho&s;e rather to face about and charge again; but there being nothing but De&s;peration in &s;uch an Attempt, they were all cut in pieces.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the <HI>French</HI> have an entire Victory; they have taken 76 Pieces of Cannon, 8 Mor|tars, above a Hundred Colours, Standards, and Kettle-Drums, with all their Carriages, Am|munition, and Baggage, five General Officers, 200 other Officers, and 2000 Soldiers; and we are told that the Enemy has left 12000 Men kill'd on the Field of Battle, be&s;ides the wound|ed, which are at lea&s;t as many.</P>
<P>This Victory is &s;o much the more glorious to <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e the Confederates lay &s;o much Stre&s;s upon the Goodne&s;s of the Troops, and the Conduct of the King of <HI>England,</HI> that they thought it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be bea|ten; but that Confidence has often times been the Ruin of great Armies.</P>
<P>It is true, the Lo&s;s of Men is exceeding great in the <HI>French</HI> Army, and e&s;pecially a|mong the Officers, of whom they have lo&s;t abundance, and a great many even of the King's own Blood are wounded; for the ter|rible Conflict in the Village, and the Manner in which they carried on the Attack, was &s;uch, that their Lo&s;s of Men mu&s;t be very great.</P>
<P>They own here the Lo&s;s of 5286 Men kill|ed and wounded; but others &s;peak of three Times that Number.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="299">
Let the Infidels fight, and tear one another to Pieces, that the Faithful may triumph over them; but Peace be in the illu&s;trious Port for ever.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. To the Selictar Aga, or Chief Sword-Bearer to the Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> Lord of the illu&s;trious among Men, Prince of the Kings of the three Corners of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a more empty and in&s;ig|nificant Pageantry on Earth than this the <HI>Nazarens</HI> make &s;uch a Noi&s;e about the World with, <HI>(viz.)</HI> about Orders of Knight|hood.</P>
<P>Old Sultan <HI>Saladine,</HI> the happy Leader of the victorious Mu&s;&s;ulman, expo&s;ed the <HI>Nazaren</HI> Knights to the la&s;t Degree of Ridicule and Laughter. In the Account of his glorious Vi|ctories over the enthu&s;ia&s;tick Crowds, rather than Armies, of tho&s;e Fools that pretended to
<PB N="282" REF="300">
fight for the Sepulchre of Je&s;us, had &s;everal of the&s;e &s;ort of People Pri&s;oners in his Ar|mies, who cau&s;ed them to be led about in Chains, with all their Trumpery, their Cro&s;&s;es, their Caps, their Mantles and Sa&s;hes, and after|wards hang'd them; they carried always &s;uch a ridiculous Weight of Trophies and Badges of one &s;ort or another, as render'd them more like Porters, bearing a va&s;t Burthen on their Backs, than Men prepared to buckle with an Adver|&s;ary.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e, a Prince by Birth, and of a Sovereign Title, was taken by one of the Sul|tan's Dwarfs, and for the Honour of the pig|my Soldier, <HI>Saladine</HI> cau&s;ed him to lead his Pri&s;oner by a Halter tied about his Neck through the <HI>Saracen</HI> Camp; in a Word, they were at la&s;t a Shame to their own People, and have been with good Rea&s;on wholly extirpated, except a &s;orry Remain of them at the I&s;land of <HI>Maltha,</HI> where they fled after the immortal <HI>So|lyman,</HI> the magnificent Emperor of the Mu&s;&s;ul|mans, drove them from the I&s;le of <HI>Rhodes.</HI></P>
<P>Here, <HI>(viz)</HI> at <HI>Maltha,</HI> they live by Rapin, Piracy, and Mock-Piety, and carry on the Cheat of their Knighthood among tho&s;e that plea&s;e to be cheated; but at pre&s;ent their Re|putation is very low.</P>
<P>But however, the fir&s;t Contrivers of the&s;e honorary Trifles have &s;unk, the thing it &s;elf re|mains; and the <HI>Nazarens</HI> are &s;o fond of it, that there is now &s;carce a Nation without what they call their Order of Knighthood; the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Emperor have that of the golden Fleece, the King of <HI>England</HI> the Garter, and the King of <HI>France</HI> a bla&s;phemous Order, called Knights of the Holy Gho&s;t. I could &s;ay much of the Impiety of it, if I were one of tho&s;e
<PB N="283" REF="301">
who believe the Divinity of the Holy Gho&s;t; but that is not to the Ca&s;e before me.</P>
<P>The Order of the Garter, which is that of the King of <HI>England,</HI> is a merry In&s;titution, and &s;ounds well enough, being conceived in a Frolick of one of their King's, dancing with a Lady, who drop'd a blue Ribband from her Leg, which they call a <HI>Garter,</HI> which the amo|rous King took up, and wore over his Shoulder; which blue Ribband is, to this Day, the chief Orna|ment of the Order; this la&s;t Month it was &s;ent as a mighty Piece of Honour to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who received the gawdy Tri&s;le with wonderful Acknowledgments, and all po&s;&s;ible Ceremony, wearing the blue Ribband above his Cloaths wherever he goes.</P>
<P>The like Compliment the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has made to Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> of the Order of the golden Fleece; and that great Warriour walks about with the Image of a dead Sheep hanging about his Neck.

from their Hi&s;tories a Summary of its Antiqui|ty and In&s;titution, and that in few Words, and leave the ridiculous Part to thy wi&s;er Ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The Order of the golden Fleece was in&s;titu|ted at <HI>Bruges</HI> by <HI>Philip the good,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in the Year 1429. who commanded that all who were admitted into this Order &s;hould carry, in a Collar compo&s;ed of Steel, flint Stones, and St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Cro&s;&s;es, the Repre&s;entation of a Sheep; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> generally believe that this Order was in&s;tituted in Honour of the holy Virgin and St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> by Rea&s;on of an Appa|rition of an Angel that appeared to a certain Countryman, and gave him a Fleece of Gold, commanding him withal to rai&s;e Forces under that Standard, and &s;o ex&s;pel the <HI>Moors</HI> out of <HI>Spain.</HI> Others believe it to have been in&s;titu|ted in Memory of the great Gain which the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy</HI> got by Wool. Others, in Remembrance of <HI>Gidcon</HI>'s Fleece, who, with Three Hundred Men, defeated the whole Ar|my of the <HI>Midianites:</HI> The Chymi&s;ts will have it to be a chymical My&s;tery, in Imitation of the famous golden Fleece of the Ancients, which the mo&s;t Refined in that Art &s;ay was no more than the Secret of their Elixir written in Parch|ment. Others pretend, that it owes the In|&s;titution of it to the fi&s;hing for Gold in &s;ome Rivers of <HI>Spain,</HI> at which Time they u&s;ed to fling a Sheep's Fleece into the Water, and after it had lain a little while, draw it up again, and picked out the Grains of Gold that &s;tuck to the Wool, which was practis'd formerly by the Inhabitants of <HI>Calchis,</HI> who by that Means became &s;o rich, that they drew the covetous <HI>Argonauts</HI> to invade them and make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their Wealth; but they who ima|gine
<PB N="285" REF="303">
that all the&s;e Orders owe their Originals to the Gallantries of Princes, affirm, that it was in Memory of a Lady's Combings, who&s;e Hair was extreamly white, and with whom <HI>Philip the good</HI> was pa&s;&s;ionately in Love; however it were, it is a very ancient and honourable Or|der, in Regard that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> not only wears it him&s;elf, but pre&s;ents it to Foreign Princes: The Habit of the Order is a Coat of Cloth of Silver, a Mantle of Crim&s;on Velvet, and a Hood of Violet colour'd Velvet.</P>
<P>Happy the in&s;pired Genius of the Faithful, who, de&s;pi&s;ing this taffety Glory, e&s;tabli&s;h their Names on the Ba&s;is of Virtue, and make them&s;elves truly great by their own heroick Actions, leaving the Prai&s;e of their Deeds to the Trophies and Garlands of the inlighten'd Train of Beauties in the Garden of Plea&s;ure, who de&s;pi&s;e the En&s;igns of temporary Honour, expecting a &s;ublimer Fame among the Millions of Heroes, who&s;e Blood has rai&s;ed the Mu&s;&s;ul|mans Empire above the Songs or the Tongues of Men; and who&s;e Merit &s;eeming to lie in the Du&s;t of Oblivion, &s;hall ri&s;e like a Comet, re|&s;ound in Glory, and enlighten with its Lu&s;tre the Vallies of Beauty in the Garden of Plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. To <HI>Mu&s;tapha O&s;man,</HI> a Dervice of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> his Friend.</HEAD>
<P>HERE is &s;uch a Tale of <HI>Nazaren</HI> Super|&s;tition told here ju&s;t now as thou ha&s;t not heard of, I believe, in many Years; and as I dare affirm, may challenge all the Follies of the blinde&s;t Ages of Pagani&s;m in the World to &s;hew any thing like it.</P>
<P>Thou art no Stranger to the Manner of the <HI>Nazaren</HI>'s Devotion, having lived among them &s;o long at <HI>Vienna,</HI> where they are as devout, that is, as &s;uper&s;titious as any where; among the re&s;t of their Fopperies, thou knowe&s;t they make <HI>Allazehiah,</HI> or con&s;ecrate a little Bit of Wafer, or Bread, which they per&s;uade the People to believe; mark, I do not &s;ay they believe it them&s;elves, I &s;ay they per&s;uade the People to believe that this Piece of Bread is turned, by the Cro&s;&s;ings and Mutterings of Words which they u&s;e over it, into the Sub&s;tance, the very Body, Bones, Blood and Fle&s;h of the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> who they wor&s;hip and call their Saviour.</P>
<P>In a Word, I &s;peak it with Horror, they call this con&s;ecrated Wafer the real God that made them and the whole Globe of Heaven and Earth; and this Trifle of their own ma|king they adore, as if Je&s;us the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> were really there. Were this Je&s;us, who they call their Prophet, to come down from the Man&s;ions of Paradi&s;e, where he is &s;urrounded
<PB N="287" REF="305">
with Glory inconceivable, with the four mighty Prophets that went before him, and where we believe our great Prophet &s;hines in un&s;ufferable Light with him; I &s;ay, were he to de&s;cend hither, and &s;ee what a paltry De|mi-God they &s;ub&s;titute in his Place, and what Adoration they pay to it in his &s;tead, he would certainly &s;courge this Idol out of his Wor&s;hip, and out of the Mo&s;chs of his Wor&s;hippers, as he did the Pawn-Brokers out of the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Biggotry of the <HI>Naza|rens.</HI> It was near a City called <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> where the Scene I am to repre&s;ent to thee was laid: A certain &s;acrilegious Wretch, who had, thou maye&s;t be &s;ure, le&s;s Venerati|on for the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> than for the golden Pix, &s;o they call the Ve&s;&s;el in which the&s;e con|&s;ecrated Gods are placed, and left upon the Altar in their Mo&s;chs; or if not &s;o, did not perhaps believe the Truth of the Prie&s;ts Allega|tions, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that God was laid up in the little Gold Box upon the Altar; I &s;ay, this Thief ha|ving more Mind to the Gold, than Veneration for the thing repo&s;ited, broke into the Mo&s;ch in the Night, and &s;tole it away.</P>
<P>The City, thou maye&s;t imagine, was in a great Uproar upon the Di&s;covery of &s;uch a dreadful Crime; the Mo&s;ch or Church was in|terdicted for 60 Days, and &s;hut up, being e&s;teemed unclean after a Wretch &s;o impious had &s;et his Foot in it. The Gates of the City were immediately &s;hut, as if a Murtherer had been to be &s;earch'd for; and the &s;trict Enquiry was &s;uch, that it was impo&s;&s;ible the Criminal could e&s;cape.</P>
<P>When he was apprehended, the main thing which was enquired of was, what he had
<PB N="288" REF="306">
done with the Deity, as they e&s;teemed it to be, which the Man, not without torturing to Extremity, at length confe&s;s'd he had thrown into a Hou&s;e of Office</P>
<P>This was received with the utmo&s;t Amaze|ment and Surprize; the Criminal was put to Death with mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Torment, being broken alive upon the Wheel, after his Fle&s;h had been fir&s;t torn with burning Pinchers.</P>
<P>But that which is behind is more &s;trange &s;till; for no &s;ooner was it known where the Wretch had ca&s;t the Ho&s;t, &s;o they call the con&s;ecrated Wafer I have named to thee; but the People flock'd Day and Night to the un|clean Place, to &s;ay their Prayers to the Idol, &s;wallowed up in Excrement; they continued this &s;tinking Devotion with &s;uch Zeal, that the fine&s;t Ladies were not a&s;hamed to be &s;een kneel|ing in that na&s;ty Place, and crowding one another almo&s;t to Death to get in; nay, if any one had fallen in; for it was a deep Vault, I believe they would have e&s;teemed it merito|rious of Heaven; nor would they have &s;uffer|ed the Filth to have been wiped off of their Clothes, lea&s;t any Part of the holy Article &s;hould have been mingled with it.</P>
<P>In a Word, the whole City concerned them|&s;elves in the thing, and to expiate the Of|fence which was committed within their Walls, they cau&s;ed the Vault, full of Filth as it was, to be arched over, and a Chappel to be built there, which is actually done, and thither the biggotted Citizens go to &s;ay their Prayers Morning and Evening.</P>
<P>Righteous <HI>O&s;man,</HI> view the Enthu&s;ia&s;m of blinded Zeal in the&s;e Infidels, with a ju&s;t Ab|horrence, and rejoice in paying a more pure Devotion to the great One God in the Mo&s;chs

of the Faithful; &s;urely the <HI>Nazarens</HI> have for|gotten the In&s;titutes of their great Prophet, wherein he taught them a more rea&s;onable Ser|vice, and are wor&s;hiping a wor&s;e God than ever the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did.</P>
<P>But nothing is more true, than that Ignorance accompanying Devotion will lead Men to do the meane&s;t, vile and loath&s;ome things, if they are but once per&s;waded it is meritorious, as the&s;e <HI>Nazarens</HI> believe: If ever the&s;e People are accepted by their great Prophet upon the Me|rit of the&s;e Devotions, Je&s;us, the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> mu&s;t be a meaner Per&s;on than even we, the Followers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> believ'd him to be.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. To <HI>Muley Hamet Mahomozzi,</HI> an <HI>Egyptian</HI> at <HI>Medina,</HI> a Ma&s;ter in the Study of Magic.</HEAD>
<P>THOU knowe&s;t, old Friend <HI>Muley,</HI> that I always condemned the Art thou ha&s;t &s;o many Years made thy Study; that I thought it an unperforming romancing Piece of Froth; that I recommended to thee rather the Study of Antiquity and Hi&s;tory, and to re&s;tore to the World the fir&s;t Ages of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and the migh|ty Wars and magnanimous Deeds of our Ance|&s;tors the <HI>Saracens;</HI> the founding their glorious Empire, &s;ince devolved upon the invincible Sultan, our glorious Emperor, upon who&s;e Head be Ten Thou&s;and Years of Joy in the bright Paths of Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="308">
Otherwi&s;e I recommended to thy capable Genius the Study of A&s;tronomy, the Search into the Motions, Magnitude, Di&s;tance, Re|volutions, and Eclyp&s;es of all the heavenly Bodies; but to turn Sorcerer and Magician in thy old Age, and to have all tho&s;e illuminated Parts which formed thy Genius, and made thee capable of mounting thy Thoughts up to Heaven; I &s;ay, to have the&s;e all &s;ink down to Hell; and in&s;tead of ranging through the &s;hining Mazes of Light in the Summits of Paradi&s;e, be groping continually in the Dark|ne&s;s of Tophet, where you can have no Light but that of the infernal Pit, no Oracle but that of the Arch-Devil Beelzebub, and in which thy highe&s;t Qualification or Acquire|ment mu&s;t be that of bringing evil Tidings to the World; this is an unaccountable Folly.</P>
<P>But I found thee ob&s;tinate and unper&s;ua|dable, &s;o I left thee to go on till old Age and Experience &s;hould bring thee to &s;ee thy &s;elf in the wrong, and that all the wonderful Pretences thou ha&s;t made to the Knowledge of hidden things, amount to no more than the Tale of a roa&s;ted Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>And now after thirty Years Study, and all the Searches thou ha&s;t made into the dark Regions of Horror; after all thy Acquaintance with the Inhabitants of the Air, and with the World of Spirits; here's a Device among the <HI>Nazarens,</HI> that, I dare &s;ay, has outdone thee in all that thou ha&s;t not only arrived to thy &s;elf, but in all that thou ha&s;t ever heard of that any one el&s;e arriv'd to; nay, I much que|&s;tion whether the Prince of evil Spirits him|&s;elf, were he permitted to a&s;&s;ume humane Shape, could act the like amazing things as this Man has done.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="309">
It is a Religieu&s;e, or a Student, as he calls him&s;elf, of the City of <HI>Leon,</HI> who carries about with him a &s;haking Rod: I fancy it &s;ometimes to be ju&s;t &s;uch another as that miraculous Rod which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> carried in his Hand when he &s;tretched it out to bring Plagues and De&s;olati|on upon thy Forefathers the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> This Prie&s;t, by the Means of this Rod or Wand, di&s;covers Trea&s;on, Con&s;piracies, Murther, and Robbery; finds out lo&s;t Trea&s;ure, forgotten Land; marks &s;ecret Adulteries; and, in a Word, detects all &s;orts of Fraud, Lying, and malicious, fal&s;e Accu&s;ations.</P>
<P>It was pre&s;ently &s;aid this Man dealt with the Devil, and they talk'd of burning him for a Wizard or Familiar; but he confound|ed them with asking, whether it was the De|vil's Bu&s;ine&s;s to detect Crimes, or to prompt Men to Crimes; to do good, or to do evil; intimating, that his Rod was qualified to ex|po&s;e Wickedne&s;s, di&s;cover all &s;orts of Villa|nies, and bring Offenders to Ju&s;tice; but had no Power to prompt or encourage any thing that was evil. And this &s;aved the Man from Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>There is no more doubt of the Truth of his Performance, than there is po&s;&s;ibility of gue&s;|&s;ing by what Means it is performed; he is now in this City, where he does Wonders, and the World is a&s;toni&s;h'd at him. Mon&s;ieur, the King's Brother, hid a great Parcel of Money in his Garden, and &s;unk a Steel-Box with &s;ome Jewels in a Fountain of Water; but the &s;haking Wand di&s;covered both immediate|ly. The Prince&s;s of <HI>Conde</HI> di&s;covered by it a Servant who had &s;tollen &s;everal Pieces of Plate from her Toilette, particularly two large Sil|ver Candle&s;ticks, tho' the Robbery had been
<PB N="292" REF="310">
committed almo&s;t three Years before. It is impo&s;&s;ible to que&s;tion the Truth of the Stories they tell of this Man, and his wondrous Rod, unle&s;s one would doubt the whole City, and believe every one you meet a Party to the Fraud.</P>
<P>For my Part, I know not what to think of this Man; for as above, there is no denying the Facts he performs, &s;o there is no re&s;olving how he performs it.</P>
<P>I know the South&s;ayers and Diviners of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> the wi&s;e Men of thy Country, and the Magicians of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> u&s;ed a Wand in all their Performances of this Nature; al&s;o we find in many ancient Writings, that the <HI>Scythians,</HI> the <HI>Sarmatians,</HI> and the <HI>Thracians,</HI> and many other Nations, u&s;ed Divinations and Sorceries by Twigs and Rods, in the &s;ame or like Manner as this <HI>Leontine</HI> does.</P>
<P>The <HI>Goths</HI> al&s;o retain'd this Cu&s;tom; whe|ther they received it from the ancient <HI>Scythians</HI> or not, I know not; but I find it crept in among the <HI>Huns,</HI> and perhaps march'd round through tho&s;e de&s;olate Parts of the World which are now call'd <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> into <HI>Laponia</HI> and the <HI>North,</HI> where nothing is more certain than that they rai&s;e Storms and Calms, and cau&s;e the Winds to blow this Way or that, as the Mariners plea&s;e or pay them, and that they do it by cro&s;&s;ing little Switches or Wands in wild and irregular Motions to tho&s;e Quarters from whence they will have it blow.</P>
<P>This Rabdomantick Art, or divining by Rods, I thought had been dropt out of the World, but they a&s;&s;ure me here, that when <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> made War in <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Soldiers would, with Rods, find out the Trea&s;ure which the Monks hid in
<PB N="293" REF="311">
their Churches and Convents, in Vaults and Places under Ground, where nothing but &s;uch an Art could do it.</P>
<P>For my Part, I have &s;o little Faith in the&s;e things, that I cannot give the Credit to it that others do; tho' at the &s;ame Time I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s I cannot detect any Falacy yet in it; tho' &s;ometimes I begin to think there mu&s;t be &s;ome <HI>Legerdemain</HI> in it, which no Body could yet find out, but which would, in Time, di&s;|cover it &s;elf, as &s;uch things generally do: The re&s;t I mu&s;t leave to Time. But I dare &s;ay thou wilt confe&s;s thou art outdone by this Man, and perhaps will &s;ay it is impo&s;&s;ible to be true; but for that there is no Room for Que&s;tion; becau&s;e there is no Argument a|gain&s;t Demon&s;tration.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. To the Kaimacham.</HEAD>
<P>THE good Fortune of the King of <HI>France</HI> is now indeed returned; and tho' he did not make the Advantage of the Spring, as he u&s;ually did, and undertook nothing early, yet the Succe&s;&s;es which have flow'd in upon him &s;ince, have abundantly made him amends. In <HI>Flanders,</HI> he has gain'd the mo&s;t glorious Victo|ry that ever he yet obtained in all his Reign; of which I have given thee a full Account; but as if this was not enough, the Succe&s;&s;es of his Armies have been on every Side equal to it, in Proportion to the Forces engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="312">
While the Armies in <HI>Flanders</HI> were preparing for that glorious Action, the Duke <HI>de Lorge</HI> pa&s;|&s;ed the <HI>Rhine</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> ravaged the Frontiers of the Empire with as much Fury as ever a Hoord of <HI>Tartars</HI> made an Inroad into <HI>Poland,</HI> only that they did not covet &s;o much the &s;weep|ing away of the People; for they do not &s;ell Slaves in the&s;e Countries, except &s;uch as are brought from <HI>Africk,</HI> who they call <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ravage they re&s;olved to attack the City of <HI>Hidleberg,</HI> the Capital of one of the Ele|ctors of the <HI>Nazaren</HI> Empire, which they did: They pu&s;h'd the Siege with &s;uch Fury on one Hand, and the Place was &s;o ill defended on the other, that they took both the City and the Ca|&s;tle in a very few Days.</P>
<P>In taking this Ca&s;tle, they were Ma&s;ters of one of the fine&s;t Palaces in all the&s;e Parts of the World, the Seat of the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> the Buildings, the Furniture, the Paintings in|imitably fine and ine&s;timably rich; all which the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Lorge</HI> cau&s;ed fir&s;t to be plun|der'd by his Soldiers, and then burnt down to the Ground; for which all the World blamed him, and &s;poke of the Mare&s;chal with great Tokens of Abhorrence.</P>
<P>But they tell us the Mare&s;chal had expre&s;s Orders from the King his Ma&s;ter for what he did; and the Rea&s;on they give for that is &s;till a greater Satyr upon the King, <HI>(viz)</HI> that he ordered the Ca&s;tle and fine Palace at <HI>Heidleberg</HI> to be demoli&s;hed; becau&s;e it was the only Palace in the World that exceeded his new Hou&s;e at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI></P>
<P>If this were true, I &s;ay, it was a great Satyr on the Pride and O&s;tentation of the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Ba&s;ene&s;s of the Go|vernour,
<PB N="295" REF="313">
who &s;o ill defended this City, has been treated with that ju&s;t Di&s;grace which &s;uch a Piece of vile Cowardice well de&s;erves, and of which I &s;end thee a particular Ac|count, that thou maye&s;t pre&s;ent to the Divan a Precedent commendable and very fit to be u|&s;ed upon &s;uch Officers, as being entru&s;ted with Places of Importance, fail in their Duty, or ba&s;ely give up the Fortre&s;&s;es of the Empire of the Faithful into the Hands of the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Heidleberg</HI> was the Baron <HI>Heide&s;dorf,</HI> a Major-General of the Emperor's Armies, a <HI>Franconian</HI> by Birth, of a good Fa|mily, one of the Knights of the Teutonick Or|der, and till now he was thought to have been a very good Officer; but his Cowardice and Surprize was proved plainly on a full Hearing before a Court Martial, and his Sentence was very &s;evere; for they &s;entenc'd him to be be|headed, after being degraded of all his Ho|nours, which was done with the utmo&s;t Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The Execution was in this Form, <HI>(viz)</HI> He was carried to the Hou&s;e of the Teutonick Order, which is in <HI>Hailbrun,</HI> where he was clad in the Robes of one of the Knights, and then having both his Collar and his Cro&s;s ta|ken from him, they &s;truck him twice upon the Face with it; then the younge&s;t Knight, taking him by the Arm, thru&s;t him out of the Hou&s;e, and gave him two Kicks at the Door that leads into the Street. Nor was this all, but he was carried in a Tumbrel by the common Hangman to the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI>'s Camp, and after he had been a Spectacle to all the Army drawn up in Battalia on Purpo&s;e, he was lead up to a Scaffold, where he was to have lo&s;t his Head, as the Sentence imported; but as the Executioner was preparing to do his Du|ty,
<PB N="296" REF="314">
there came a Reprieve, which gave him his Life, at the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Teutonick Order, but &s;till more Di&s;grace: for after the Hangman had girt his Sword about him, he took it from him again immediately, broke it in two, and gave him three Slaps with the flat Side of the Blade upon his Face. At the End of this ignominious Execution, he was decla|red bani&s;h'd out of the Circles of <HI>Suabia, Fran|conia,</HI> the <HI>upper Rhine,</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> to which Purpo&s;e the Hangman carried him in his Tum|brel beyond the <HI>Neckar,</HI> and there left him; where, as &s;ome Letters &s;ay, the Country-Peo|ple, much more his Friends than they who begg'd his Life on &s;uch &s;hameful Terms, in a few Days after, knock'd him on the Head; &s;ome &s;ay he reque&s;ted a Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r, that is, a Coun|try-Fellow, to do him that Office, as of Kind|ne&s;s, that he might not live to &s;ee his Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Heroick Prince of the immortal Spahis, thou art well able to judge how much more agree|able Death mu&s;t be to a Man of Honour than &s;uch U&s;age; and after all, they &s;ay the Baron was a Man of as much per&s;onal Bravery as any Man, and had di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf with great Advantage upon many Occa&s;ions; however, being overpowered now with great Numbers, and &s;eeing no Relief at hand, he unhappily mis|behav'd at la&s;t.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes too to let the Weight of all fall upon one Head, to excu&s;e others; for after all, they alledge that due Care was not taken to repair the Fortifications of the Place, or to give him a Body of Men able to have made a good Defence.</P>
<P>Happy the invincible Empire of the Mu&s;&s;ul|mans, where it never was known that any Governour, Aga, or Ba&s;&s;a, in the numerous
<PB N="297" REF="315">
Armies of the Grand Seignior, being entru&s;ted with the Defence of any fortified Town, be|tray'd it to the Unbelievers; let the <HI>Nazarens</HI> te&s;tifie for us, and let it be &s;poken openly, what Characters they give here to the Honour of our Ba&s;&s;a's, Governours of <HI>Buda, Newhau&s;el, Gran, Cani&s;ia, great Waradin,</HI> and <HI>Belgrade;</HI> and to the Blood tho&s;e Sieges or Blockades have co&s;t the Unbelievers before they got them, or any of them, into their Hands.</P>
<P>In this the Empire of our immortal Sultan is truly invincible, <HI>(viz)</HI> that nothing falls out of the Hands of his Slaves, the Leaders of his mighty Armies, but with all the Re&s;i&s;tance and Defence that Honour and an inviolable Fideli|ty to their Ma&s;ter calls for from them.</P>
<P>I remember the glorious Defence thou ma|de&s;t at the fir&s;t Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> made famous un|der thy Government by the Bones the <HI>Naza|rens</HI> left in Heaps under the Walls; for which inimitable Conduct thou art &s;till honoured a|mong thy Enemies, and advanced worthily to the Favour and Cabinet of the greate&s;t Empe|ror in the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. To the Captain Ba&s;&s;a.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t to thee, I gave an Account of a terrible Blow given to the <HI>French</HI> Naval Power by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> in the great Battle at Sea, and the burning their Ships after|wards
<PB N="298" REF="316">
in their own Harbour, thou maye&s;t now &s;ee the Rever&s;e.</P>
<P>Certainly what the <HI>French</HI> want in Force, they make up in Policy and in Vigilance: it was true that the <HI>French,</HI> though their Dili|gence in repairing their Navy was beyond all that the World thought po&s;&s;ible, were not able to fight the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet joined together, who were no le&s;s than 80 Men of War of the Line; yet by their Vigilance and Dexterity in taking hold of the Advantage of|fer'd them, they have given the Confederates a terrible Blow at Sea; and had not the Confede|rates been very fortunate, even in this Di&s;a&s;ter, the Blow had been much greater.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who&s;e Trade is their Wealth, and the Fountain of their Strength, e&s;pecially at Sea, had prepared a mighty Fleet of Merchant-Ships bound to <HI>Portugal, Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Levant,</HI> and to the augu&s;t Port al&s;o, (the Receptacle of Nations) richly freighted with all &s;orts of Wealth, and rich Com|modities, proper for tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>This great Fleet contained above 400 Sail, and the grand Navy being ready to &s;ail, it was thought convenient to take the Advantage of their Convoy as far as they could be had, which was to the Mouth of the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;|cay.</HI> Here the &s;aid united grand Navy left the Merchants to proceed on their &s;everal Voy|ages, and left them about thirty Men of War to be their Convoy.</P>
<P>It was in an ill Hour the grand Fleet left them, the 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June;</HI> for the vigilant <HI>French,</HI> who watch'd for &s;uch a de&s;irable Booty, and well knew where they would part, &s;ailed about 4 Days before them from the Coa&s;t of <HI>France</HI> with 50 Men of War, and waited for them in
<PB N="299" REF="317">
<HI>Legos</HI> Bay, and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> about Cape St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> which they call here the Southward Cape.</P>
<P>About the 23<HI>d</HI> they took a &s;mall <HI>French</HI> Bark, who told them there was 18 <HI>French</HI> Men of War in <HI>Legos</HI> Bay; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> having 30 Men of War, thought of a Booty rather than a Battle on that Account. On the 26<HI>th</HI> they began to di&s;cover &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Ships of War, being at that Time about Cape St. <HI>Vin|cent,</HI> and the next Day in the Morning they plainly perceived the whole <HI>French</HI> Fleet, to their great Surprize, and even Amazement. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral with 22 Men of War, di&s;covering plainly the &s;uperior Strength of the <HI>French,</HI> &s;hifted his Cour&s;e we&s;tward, and ha|ving &s;ome Advantage of the Wind, made all the Sail they could, giving a Signal to the Merchant-Ships and to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War to follow: Among the Merchant-Ships there was the greate&s;t Con&s;ternation, imaginable every one cried out to his Fellow, we are all undone.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> not regarding &s;o much the Men of War, fell in among the Merchant-Men, who, every one endeavour'd to &s;hift for them|&s;elves the be&s;t they could; and the Fleet be|ing &s;o very great, many got away; however, above Three&s;core and Six Sail were taken or burnt, mo&s;t of them richly laden; two <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, after an ob&s;tinare Fight, were taken; four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant-Ships immen&s;ly rich, bound to the happy Port, were &s;unk by the <HI>French</HI> after they were entered the Harbour of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship burnt.</P>
<P>In a Word, tho' it was next to miraculous that the <HI>French</HI> got no more Booty, yet the Lo&s;s to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> amounts to many
<PB N="300" REF="318">
Millions of Livres, and the Con&s;ternation through|out tho&s;e trading Nations is inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> lo&s;t three Sultanas taken, and two burnt; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> two, and a Store Ship, be|&s;ides the Merchant-Ships.</P>
<P>This Action has reviv'd the Courage, and re|&s;tor'd the Credit of the <HI>French</HI> Seamen, who, it was &s;aid, were very much di&s;pirited at the la&s;t Year's Misfortune, and at the manife&s;t Superi|ority of the Confederate Fleets: The Lo&s;s of the Confederates in Ships and in Goods is e&s;teemed at 25 Millions of Livres, and the <HI>French</HI> &s;ay, that now they are even with the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> for the burning their Men of War at <HI>La-Hogue.</HI></P>
<P>The very &s;ame Hour almo&s;t that this News makes glad the People of <HI>France,</HI> they are re|joycing al&s;o on the Accounts of accumulated Vi|ctories over their Enemies on all Sides: on the <HI>Rhine</HI> they have pu&s;h'd the <HI>Germans</HI> far into the Empire, defeated &s;everal of their Bodies, rai|&s;ed infinite Contributions upon the Circles, di&s;mantled their Towns, and ravaged the Country.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Army and Navy has carried <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> by a &s;hort Siege of eight Days by Sea and Land, and has ravaged the Country far and wide even to the Gates of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> which it is &s;aid they will al&s;o be&s;iege.</P>
<P>Invincible Captain of a Thou&s;and Sultanas, chief Admiral of the Armadas of the Faithful, thou knowe&s;t what it is to gain Victories, as well as to rejoice in them; the Triumphs of the <HI>French</HI> Nation are faint Emblems of the glorious Conque&s;ts of our invincible Emperor, in the Days when the Kingdoms of the World fell fa&s;ter into their Hands than Towns do here into the Hands of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="319">
May Victories continue &s;till to crown the Head of thy immortal Ma&s;ter, till, &s;urround|ed with inimitable Glory, he a&s;cends to Para|di&s;e in the Arms of our great Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> there to enjoy the Trea&s;ures of Peace in the Company of <HI>Omar, Ekir,</HI> and <HI>Alibeker</HI> the ble&s;|&s;ed, and &s;hine like the Sun in the Strength of inexpre&s;&s;ible Glory.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. To the Grand Vizier.</HEAD>
<P>I Am de&s;tin'd to write of nothing but Victo|ries for this whole Year; if <HI>France</HI> goes on thus a little longer, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and the bright Scepter of the invincible Race of <HI>Ottoman</HI> the glorious, who&s;e Days be many, and his People pro&s;perous, will meet on the Banks of <HI>Danubius,</HI> and &s;hare the Empire of the World between them.</P>
<P>I have thrice already written of the Victories of the <HI>French</HI> by Land and Sea: The taking of Cities and Towns, and a va&s;t Extent of Domi|nions depending on them, are things too mean to engage a Pen which has the Wonders of this Reign to de&s;cribe: <HI>France</HI> has crown'd the Campaign with another compleat Victory, and that over the Enemy of all the re&s;t which mo&s;t moved his Choler.</P>
<P>It had been a Mortification almo&s;t in&s;upport|able to the <HI>French</HI> Court, to find the little D of <HI>Savoy,</HI> a Prince, who, the King, could, at another
<PB N="302" REF="320">
Time have cru&s;h'd with one of his Fingers, in&s;ult him while his Hands were, as it were, tied by the Struggles he had with more &s;ignificant E|nemies. The Mare&s;chal <HI>Catinat</HI> complained, in his Letters to the King, that while the Mare|&s;chal <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> had &s;till 135000 Men in <HI>Flanders,</HI> even after the Confederates were de|feated at <HI>Landen,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Lorge</HI> 70000 Men on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and no Enemy to fight with, and the Duke <HI>de Noailles</HI> 22000 in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> dur&s;t not look him in the Face, he only <HI>(Catinat)</HI> &s;hould be left with a handful of Men, as if condemn'd to the Mi&s;ery of &s;eeing his Maje&s;ty affronted by the <HI>Savoyard,</HI> without Power to re&s;i&s;t; and concludes his Letter with earne&s;t Entreaties for Succours, or that the King would give him leave with 4000 Hor&s;e (that were with him, and that were made de&s;perate with &s;eeing the Ruine of their Country) to break into the Enemy's Armies, and die as be|came them with their Swords in their Hands.</P>
<P>At length the King gave Ear to the Mare&s;chal's Importunities, and ordered the Duke <HI>de Lorge</HI> to make a Detachment of 12000 Men from <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> to march to <HI>Italy,</HI> among which were the <HI>Gens d' Arms,</HI> and other Troops of the Hou&s;ehold; and at the &s;ame Time, the Campaign being over in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Noailles</HI> was ordered to detach 4000 Foot and 2000 Hor&s;e from that Side; and tho' the March was long, yet both tho&s;e Detachments, together with 4000 Men from <HI>Provence,</HI> joined Mon&s;ieur <HI>Catinat</HI> almo&s;t together, and came in &s;o good time, that he had an Opportunity to enter <HI>Piedmont</HI> ju&s;t as the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> grown haughty by his Succe&s;s, pre|tended to bombard <HI>Pignerol.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke hearing of the March of the <HI>French,</HI> drew off, and retreated to cover <HI>Turin,</HI> which
<PB N="303" REF="321">
the Mare&s;chal <HI>Catinat</HI> made him believe he would attack, and the two Armies met in the great Plain of <HI>Mar&s;aglia,</HI> about five Leagues from <HI>Turin.</HI></P>
<P>The Mare&s;chal, an old Soldier, who knew his Army was now equal at lea&s;t in Number, and &s;uperior in Cavalry to the <HI>Savoyard,</HI> and who&s;e Troops were &s;ufficiently provoked by the Ravages which the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops in particular had made the Year before in <HI>France;</HI> for which they waited an Occa&s;ion to pay them home; I &s;ay, the Mare&s;chal and his whole Army breathing nothing but Revenge, made no Stop, but as &s;oon as they came up with their Enemies, let them &s;ee they mu&s;t fight for it, and acrordingly lying but one Night in Reach of the Duke's Army, the next Morning he marched in full Battalia directly to their Camp, and fell upon them with &s;uch Fury, that no|thing could with&s;tand them.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erv'd, that the Cavalry in the <HI>French</HI> left Wing and the Infantry in the main Battle charg'd their Enemy Sword in Hand without firing a Gun; the Foot with their Handjars &s;crew'd on the Muzzles of their Pieces, a Me|thod never practi&s;ed before, coming up to the Teeth of the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> Troops, overturn'd all that &s;tood in their Way; &s;o that receiving their fir&s;t Fire, and not firing at all them&s;elves, the Enemies were cut in pieces before they had time to charge their Muskets a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this daring Courage of the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Troops, di&s;piritted the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Troops to that Degree, that they could no where &s;tand their Ground before the <HI>French;</HI> their Ar|my is quite broken, above 9000 kill'd on the Spot, 2000 taken Pri&s;oners, 34 Pieces of Cannon, all their Baggage, and 106 Colours and Standards taken by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="322">
Invincible Prince of Generals, the Particu|lars of this Battle will a&s;&s;ure thee how ea&s;ily the <HI>German</HI> Cavalry are to be conquered: Not the Curia&s;&s;ers them&s;elves, of whom &s;uch terrible things have been &s;aid, tho' arm'd and barb'd Man and Hor&s;e, were able to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>French Gens d' Arms</HI> and Light Hor&s;e; who de&s;pi&s;ing Ar|mour, and neglecting their Carabines, charg'd naked into the Line of the <HI>German</HI> Hor&s;e, and by the dextrous Management of their Hor&s;es, and an invincible daring Courage, broke them in an in&s;tant, and cut them in pieces with their Swords only.</P>
<P>Glory attend the Armies of the illu&s;trious re|&s;plendent Emperor of the World, led by thy experienc'd and victorious Hand. The&s;e Victo|ries of the <HI>French</HI> will make way for thy Con|que&s;ts, and the <HI>Nazaren</HI> Emperor &s;hall no more be able to &s;tand before thee, being obliged to call off his Armies to defend his imperial Pa|lace from the conquering <HI>French,</HI> who, if no &s;udden and unexpected Accident intervene, will &s;oon make the Walls of <HI>Vienna</HI> tremble.</P>
<P>While I am writing this to thee, News is come from the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> that he has convinc'd the World that the Victory he obtain|ed at <HI>Landen</HI> was compleat, by his be&s;ieging <HI>Char|leroy</HI> in the Face of the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Army, who pretended to be recruited again, but did not think fit to try their Hands in another Bat|tle. The Town held out but 26 Days after the Trenches were open'd, and is &s;urrender'd, which makes the Victories of the <HI>French</HI> this Year be no le&s;s than 13 in Number.</P>
