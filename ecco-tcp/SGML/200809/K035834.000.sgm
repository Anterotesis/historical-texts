<STAGE>A Room in Sir Simon Flourish's House. Enter <HI>SIR SIMON</HI> and <HI>OLD TESTY.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT, my good friend Testy, do lower the pitch of your voice a little; for to speak so very loud is really not well-bred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll speak as loud as I like, and say what I like. Damn your fine breeding!&mdash;an ounce of honesty is worth an hundred weight of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now&mdash;ounce and hundred weight! Can't you contrive to think, and talk a little like a Man of Fashion? When you quitted busi|ness, you shou'd have dispos'd of your vulga|rity with your stock in trade. Copy me. Do you find any thing vulgar about me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! you and I liv'd too long together to think of cajoling each other: you are as vulgar as I am&mdash;I wish you were half as honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good friend, if we are not to attempt cajoling each other, the less you say about your honesty the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what have you to say against my ho|nesty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, I am too well bred: beside, I was your partner in trade for twenty-five years.&mdash;I reap'd half the profits of your ingenuity, and had you been honester, I might be poorer. But, my dear friend, let us settle our business a little quietly, if you will be so kind. Your son, you say, is come to town:&mdash;good. You insist he may be introduc'd to our ward, Miss Hartley:&mdash;he shall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you'd say so; because 'tis very un|fair to my own son, who being absent from England, ought not to have a rival introduc'd to the Lady I wish to be his wife. But remem|ber, as she cannot marry without our joint con|sent, we must agree, that which ever she pre|fers shall have our mutual approbation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! mine is the boy that will win her! Edu|cated with every advantage; now receiving the last polish, the finishing stroke to his accom|plishments, <HI>in a Tour through Europe!</HI>&mdash;Oh! he is a&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he is a pretty boy. That youth will put foreign ingenuity to the test. If they can send him away more dissipated than they find him, I will give them credit for one miracle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave your growling, good Mr. Bear, and look after your own unlick'd cub. His coun|try breeding will render him vastly pleasing to a young lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a model of perfection. Innocent him|self, he will never suspect that evil exists, that may make him liable to imposition: but I have adopted a remedy in my choice of a profession for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To render him in some degree a match for the roguery of the world, I shall make him a Lawyer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I dare say, his Yorkshire simplicity will qualify him admirably for the profession!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Flourish, the only thing we were ever in one mind about, was parting, and I conclude you have no objection to it now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>None in the least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall send my son, and mind, fair play's the word.</P>

<P>A little after my leaving Bath! <STAGE>(repeats falter|ingly.)</STAGE> Oh yes, some damn'd good-natur'd friend blabb'd when my back was turned <STAGE>(aside).</STAGE> Why really, Captain, I don't recollect what can have given you offence at Bath.</P>

<P>That I readily believe; for it would be hard to expect you to recollect what you never heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, Sir Simon, you cannot be expected to know the insult offer'd me, by a man who did not arrive till you were gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the man that insulted you did not arrive till I was gone! Lord, what a load is off my

mind! <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> And so Captain, a villain had the audacity to insult you.</P>

<P>I was insulted, Sir Simon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll not let him live. You'll tear him to atoms&mdash;I know you will&mdash;Blood and thunder! if it were my case&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be cool, Sir Simon&mdash;you are too desperate.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am&mdash;I know it is my fault; but fire and fury!&mdash;Can I assist you in this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the very cause of my visit to you&mdash;Will you honour me so far as to deliver a bit of a message for me?</P>

<P>What, carry a challenge for you? <STAGE>(eagerly.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and be your Second?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I may take the liberty to ask such a favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Captain, give me your hand. I am the happiest man alive to serve a friend. I'll see you through this affair; I'll take care of you. Where am I to go? What am I to do first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first of all, there is a little preparatory business. Before I can receive satisfaction for the injury done me, I must put it in the power of my adversary to give it me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, the young man is unluckily in prison for debt: and as he has friends who are able to release him, I thought it wou'd be taking a liberty to rob them of a pleasure they have the best right to;&mdash;but they scorn to be outdone in politeness, and, I believe, wou'd let him remain till doomsday, before they would dispute the point with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you mean to pay his debts on purpose to fight him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, and I wish I had a better motive; for though injur'd honour demands atonement, I wou'd rather do one little bit of a kindness than revenge a thousand injuries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will it cost you much?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than is quite convenient, and therefore I must trespass on your goodness in a second instance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! what, how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be under the necessity of troubling you for three hundred pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! it is a vast deal of money: I think you had better not fight him till there is an Act of Insolvency. Or, could'nt you get a snug little room in the Prison, and fight him at his own home; that would be more genteel and accommodating. No, no&mdash;plague take it, that won't do; for if you kill him, they will keep
<PB N="12" REF="10">
us there. I should like to see you fight amaz|ingly, but then to pay three hundred pounds for it, it is very dear: I only paid a guinea to see Johnson and Big Ben, and their way of fighting is quite as fashionable now-a days!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Understand me, Sir Simon. I don't intend to be under an obligation to you or any man. I have brought my Commission as security for the sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Security! my dear friend, do you think I want security? That is like a Trader; there is no security with People of Fashion. Yet I may as well take it by way of memorandum. <STAGE>(Takes the Commission.)</STAGE> Well, tell me who he is, and where he is to be found. I'll carry him the money and the challenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! by no means. He must not know the money comes from me. He may feel it un|pleasant to be under an obligation to a man he has wrong'd; and to know that I had injur'd his feelings, would not be the way to satisfy mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a very strange man! There is the money, manage it your own way.</P>
<STAGE>[Gives him Notes.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NIELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, and as soon as he has got the miseries of a prison a little out of his mind, you shall wait on him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as you please. The sooner the bet|ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NEILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too impetuous, you fiery little fellow! We must not be in a hurry, for misfortune is apt to lower a man's spirit, and I scorn to meet a foe in a state of degradation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you must act as you chuse, only fight soon, for I shall think of nothing else. I know I am a desperate dog. When I was at school, they us'd to call me the little Game-Cock. You are to do as you like, but were it my own affair, I should stand close, muzzle to muzzle, toe to toe.&mdash;Damme, I'd fight him in a saw-pit. I wonder I have not fought yet. I never was even ask'd to be a Second till now; but, I be|lieve, I know pretty well from the newspapers what a Second has to do:&mdash;To load the pistols, measure the ground, take care they stand near enough, and let them fire as long as they like. I believe that is all. Oh no! If the parties are wounded, he is to leave them on the ground, to the mercy of chance, and take care of himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NEILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not to dictate your conduct, Sir Simon; only it might be well if every Second would consider that his office is that of a Friend to ad|just an affair of Honour&punc; not of a Sheriff to wit|ness an execution. Good morning, Sir Simon.</P>

<P>My dear, Sir Simon! how glad I am you're at home! If I am ever so little a while away from you, my darling, it appears a long, tedious age. How does my lovy do? Do look tender! 'tis so becoming to you; and beside, if you don't, you know you break my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now really, Lady Flourish, you are too fond before company, indeed you are. 'Tis your only fault, my dear. But you ought to consider, that to be fond of a husband at all, is very un|fashionable; and therefore, when a wife feels that amiable weakness, she ought never to ex|pose it before people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I can't help exposing it. Miss Hartly knows I have been talking of nothing else but my dearest the whole time I have been out: all the while I was buying my china, and my gold muslins, and my lace, I was longing to be at home with my darling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, my dear: I wish you had indulg'd your longing, and then you wou'd n't have laid out so much money. And how is my dear Miss Hartley? You don't seem in spirits.</P>

<P>Lord, your Ladyship! I could not think of Miss Hartley being troubled with such a brute of a fellow, especially, my Lady, as his Honour Sir Simon designs Miss for his own son; so, an't please you, my Lady, I sent him away with a flea in his ear.</P>

<P>You are pretty right there; for between those who, having too little courage, want to be thought to have enough, and those who have so much, 'tis always boiling over&mdash;a quiet man's life is in a constant state of requisition.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, how came you two to quarrel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT. O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The only way that two honest men can quar|rel&mdash;by mistake.&mdash;However, before we troubled our pistols to speak for us, we thought it no dishonour to speak a little for ourselves; by which means we found out, that though we met to settle a dispute, devil a dispute we had to settle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT. O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it appears that this same good looking
<PB N="41" REF="39">
countenance of mine is unlucky enough to re|semble the phiz of a Gentleman Blacklegs, who by a little trick or two in the way of his trade, disburthen'd our friend of his cash. He thought, when he met me in the Rooms at Bath, (and the place, to be sure&punc; was not much in my fa|vour) that he had nick'd his man and accosted me accordingly. We lost one another in the croud, and he departed in his error. I learnt his name, and follow'd him to London; where, if I hadn't had wisdom enough to ask an explana|tion, I might have been sent out of the world for the misfortune of resembling a scoundrel.</P>

<P>How much I must ever feel bound to you!</P>

<SPEAKER>CAPT. O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is blundering indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Captain O'Neil&mdash;my friend, Jack Flourish, is a very whimsical fellow.&mdash;If he had been out of Limbo, you wou'd have seen him earlier; for I shou'd have brought him for my Second.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, you would not; for to be Second in a Duel is, in my mind, an employment pretty nearly as honourable as to be Jack Ketch's Deputy.</P>

<P>All the Flourishes are not of that opinion. I presume you are no relation to that little game-cock, Sir Simon?</P>

<P>Yes, Sir Simon's son travels like a mill|horse, a great deal in a small space. But here he is, here's Jack Flourish, and if he had not had the wisdom to stay at home, he wou'd have lost the good fortune of becoming acquainted with you.

<P>I should be jealous of your praise, if Old England and Old Ireland were not exactly the same spot of ground. So you are, really and truly, the fine travell'd young Gentleman, Mr. Flourish? Oh, you are a hopeful boy! I assure you, your father believes you have been seen and admir'd in every Court in Europe.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>

<P>Is it so? Enough said, then. He that can't make sport, never let him spoil it.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you like London prodigiously?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hugely! What did my Quiz of a Father mean by keeping me in the Country so long? I ought to have been as wise as I am now five years ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure; and your knowledge wou'd not have surpriz'd people either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not at all. I am not half so knowing as I ought to be, for all I was bred in Yorkshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was in your favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! 'twas Heaven's mercy I was pitched into a cutish county, or I shou'd never have been
<PB N="48" REF="46">
able to shew my face here. Why, boys of six|teen here know a great deal more than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Boys of sixteen! Men of sixteen, you mean! Sixteen! why, 'tis the prime of a man's life! Who are your greatest men on the turf?&mdash;your men of sixteen. Who keep your dashing women in the greatest style?&mdash;your men of sixteen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I thought. It came into my head, that keeping your dashing women was a very young trick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing now is in a state of forwardness unknown to our ancestors. London may be termed an immense hot house, where every thing is forc'd. You eat your fruit before it is in season. You run through your constitution before it is matured. You spend your estate before you are in possession, and get divorced from your wife before you ought to have mar|ried. 'Tis a lively system&mdash;Is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, a short life and a merry one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you were out of luck last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a little; and when I had lost all my mo|ney, it was vastly friendly of you to lend me the 200l. but I lost them too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will happen so sometimes. A lad of spirit does not mind such trifles. I will thank you, though, to return me the money: for I am ra|ther out of cash.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="49" REF="47">
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll thank you for the 200l. I lent you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, I could as soon give you a million. My father does not allowance me in such a grand stile as that comes to. I must catch him in a devilish good humour, aye, and in a great many of them, before I get 200l. of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis damn'd shabby of you to borrow money you can't pay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this your friendship? Why, did not you force it on me? Did not you tell me you only liv'd in obliging your friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make a small mistake; I told you, I only liv'd <HI>by</HI> obliging my friends. But as it is not convenient to you to pay the money, give me your Note, and it will do just as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! now you are my friend again. I thought you would not desert me so soon. You who so kindly took me by the hand&mdash;taught me to punt at Faro, told me the nicks and crabs at Hazard, and though you never play yourself, were so kind to introduce me to all your friends that do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a stamp&mdash;sign your name&mdash;I have fill'd it up. I thought you cou'dn't pay me di|rectly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="50" REF="48">
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is this?&mdash;<Q>On demand, I promise to pay Nic. Snare, Esq. 400l. value receiv'd.</Q>&mdash;Dang it, man, you lent me but two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think I'm to be paid nothing for my risk? Your father may disinherit you, and I may never get a doit. No, no, I shall never live by obliging my friends at that rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, this is damn'd scandalous! pay four hun|dred pounds for two, and not have the worth of a six pence to show for it! Damn London&mdash;I wish I had staid in Yorkshire all the days of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very ungrateful of you to put yourself in a passion with <HI>me,</HI> who have taught you so many pretty games.</P>

<P>Do you practise much at the bar, Sir?</P>

</SP>

<P>And retir'd from it with your just deserts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not exactly, Sir, or I must say I should have been in a more elevated situation. Men often retire from the Bar with less than they merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD TESTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>More's the pity. Well&mdash;I will not intrude any longer, Tom. I call'd to give you money
<PB N="52" REF="50">
to pay for your furniture and your books: ne|ver be in debt longer than you can help. Al|ways pay your way. There's a draft for 400l. and so good morning, and thank you kindly for all you have done for my son. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>A very good kind of an old gentleman that father of your's: mind what he says&mdash;"Never be in debt longer than you can help. Always pay your way." That 400l. will just balance our little account.</P>

<P>Oh, damn your honour! Did not you hear my father say, it was for my Upholsterer and Bookseller? They have been for their money already, and if I don't pay them, who knows but they will send me to jail?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNARE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no! Tradesmen are us'd to go without their money; but Gentlemen, like me, must touch the <HI>ready,</HI> or your character is lost for ever. So at once pay me, or I'll expose you.</P>
</SP>

<P>There&mdash;plague take you&mdash;there is the money. And now if I don't marry directly, I may go hang myself; and of two evils&mdash;</P>

<P>Hold your tongue&mdash;Say no more. I believe you are quite good enough for the blockhead you have got, and so he may pack into York|shire again, and carry you with him as a sam|ple of a London Fine Lady.</P>

<P>But this gentleman's taking the liberty of marrying our Ward without our consent is a thing which&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! 'tis a very great insult&mdash;and a word in your ear, my little game-cock&mdash;If you mean to call him to account for it, I'll be your Second.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't want to have any thing to do with Seconds.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I was going to fight him, you were to have been my Second, and I only offer to re|turn the obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is this the gentleman you redeem'd out of prison, to have the pleasure of fighting?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it to you, then, I owe my liberty? Gene|rous man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, it was very generous, to be sure, to re|lease you out of prison, that I might have the satisfaction of sending you out of the world. But Sir Simon, this gentleman, in fortune, is equal to the Lady he has wedded.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Captain O'Neil, I am not conscious of what you are asserting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am, or I wou'd not assert it. Under|standing that your Uncle had taken it into his head to be angry with you for nothing at all, I called on the old gentleman to talk with him a little about it&mdash;"If your Nephew had been
<PB N="90" REF="88">
guilty of a dishonourable action," said I, "de|vil a word wou'd O'Neil offer in his behalf; but as he has been a dupe to the villainy of others, restore him to your favour, and launch him into the world again, with experience for his Pilot."&mdash;So the old gentleman shook hands with me, and swore he was ready to do the same with you as soon as you pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks are too poor for such nobleness of soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN O'NEIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobleness of soul! for walking a few steps out of my common road, for the pleasure of reconciling a discarded Nephew to a rich old Uncle. Oh! if people wou'd but just lengthen their morning's walk to do a few good natur'd actions, they can scarcely conceive what health and spirits such exercise wou'd give them, and how much sweeter they wou'd rest for it at night!</P>

<P>Come, father, the truth must out&mdash;The two different systems of education have at last been compleated in the same college; and though I don't think keeping Terms here absolutely neces|sary for the finish of every young gentleman's education; yet, as a school of adversity it has taught me this lesson&mdash;Never, by folly and ex|travagance, to run the chance of returning, when once you do me the honour to take my name out of the books</P>
