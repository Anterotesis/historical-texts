<P>ROSINA, A COMIC OPERA, IN TWO ACTS. PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception this little Piece has met with from the Public, demands my warme&s;t acknowledgments: nor can I &s;ay too much of the &s;upport it has received, both from the mu&s;ic, admirably adapted to the words, and the &s;pirited and judicious performance of the &s;eve|ral characters, which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The decorations, de&s;igned and executed in that &s;tyle of elegant and characteri&s;tic &s;implicity which the &s;ubject requir'd, add greatly to the effect of the whole.</P>
<P>The fable of this piece, taken from the book of Ruth; a fable equally &s;imple, moral, and intere&s;t|ing, has already furni&s;hed a &s;ubject for the beauti|ful Epi&s;ode of Palemon and Lavinia in Thom&s;on's Sea&s;ons, and a plea&s;ing Opera of Mon&s;. Favart: of both I have availed my&s;elf as far as the differ|ence of my plan would allow; but as we are not, however extraordinary it may appear, &s;o ea&s;ily &s;a|tisfied with mere &s;entiment as our more &s;prightly neighbours the French, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to di|ver&s;ify the &s;tory by adding the comic characters of William and Phoebe, which I hop'd might at once relieve, and heighten the &s;entimental ca&s;t of the other per&s;onages of the drama.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;ongs, and a few &s;hort pa&s;&s;ages of the dialogue, (printed with inverted commas) though judiciou&s;ly omitted in the repre&s;entation from the apprehen&s;ion of making the Opera too long, are here re&s;tor'd, as tending to mark the cha|racters with more preci&s;ion.</P>

<P>Faith, good woman, you owe nothing at all. I'll tell your honor how it was. My comrades and I were cro&s;&s;ing the meadow, going home, when we &s;aw them fir&s;t; and hearing a woman, cry, I look'd up, and &s;aw them putting her into a &s;kiff again&s;t her will. Says I, Paddy, is not that the clever little <HI>crater</HI> that was <HI>glaning</HI> in the field with us this morning? "'Tis &s;o, &s;ure enough," &s;ays he. "By St. Patrick," &s;ays I, "there's enough of us to <HI>re&s;cute</HI> her." With that we ran for the bare life, waded up to the knees, laid about us bravely with our &s;hillelays, knock'd them out of the &s;kiff, and brought her back &s;afe: and here &s;he comes, my jewel.</P>

<P>This noble refu&s;al paints your character. I know another, Ro&s;ina, who loves you with as &s;trong, though purer ardor: the timidity in&s;eparable from real love has hitherto prevented his declaring him&s;elf&mdash;but if allowed to hope&mdash;</P>
