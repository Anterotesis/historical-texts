<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem was written in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ummer. Why it was not offered to the Stage, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention. If it could in any degree an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, for which it was originally de|&s;igned, it would not be, as perhaps now is the ca&s;e, a mere trifle offered to the Public. The Author is con&s;cious that his powers are neither equal to the &s;ubject, nor to the zeal with which he undertook it. Removed though he is from the political world, he could not, in his private retreat, be altogether inattentive to the various events, which in the la&s;t &s;even years have changed the face of Europe, and, under the &s;avage conduct of a Nation of profe&s;&s;ed Athei&s;ts, counteracted the order of Providence in the formation of
<PB N="vi" REF="3">Civil Society. <HI>Nihil e&s;t illi Principi Deo, qui omnem hunc Mundum regit, quod quidem in terris fiat acceptius, quam Concilia Coetus que hominum jure Sociati, quoe</HI> CIVITATES <HI>appellantur</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Somn. Scip. S. iii.</NOTE>. He &s;aw the Monarchy of France overturned by the fury of a Demo|cratic Faction, who have &s;ince reduced their whole Nation to a &s;tate of Slavery not to be paralelled in the Records of Hi&s;tory. FIVE MEN called the DIRECTORY, have &s;ilenced the Legi&s;lature of their country; they tran&s;|ported Seventy of the Members to peri&s;h on a foreign &s;hore, and from that time have not &s;uffered their NATIONAL ASSEMBLY to enter into a Debate, or to pa&s;s a &s;ingle Law.</P>
<P>The U&s;urpers at fir&s;t covered their ambition with the ma&s;k of Patriots &s;truggling for Li|berty; and, as &s;oon as they found them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Power, they de&s;troyed LIBERTY ITSELF. With men of their &s;tamp the prac|tice has been uniformly the &s;ame from the days of Tacitus to the pre&s;ent hour. <HI>Ut Im|perium evertant,</HI> LIBERTATEM praeferunt; &s;r Everterint, LIBERTATEM IPSAM aggredi|untur <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Annal.

When the Revolution began in France, the People of England did not look much deeper than the &s;urface; the love of innova|tion was for &s;ome time thought to be zeal for civil liberty; and by great politicians and eminent orators it was called The FABRIC OF HUMAN WISDOM. That doctrine was &s;pread far and wide, and hone&s;t men were deceived by appearances. In the mean time a JACO|BIN PARTY was formed in various parts of England by CONSTITUTIONAL CLUBS and CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES. Republicans in their hearts they pretended to act with ar|dour for the Con&s;titution. They talked of the RIGHTS OF MAN, of REFORM OF PAR|LIAMENT, and UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE, while in &s;ecret they wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee the horrors of French Anarchy intro|duced into this kingdom. They knew that in a thunder-&s;torm the dregs of the barrel ri&s;e to the top. They had read in the fable, that when the oak and the cedar were felled to the ground, the bramble reigned over the fore&s;t. Having nothing to lo&s;e, they hoped in a convul&s;ion of the &s;tate, that they &s;hould find their private advantage. The &s;ame views and principles in every age and coun|try
<PB N="viii" REF="5">have been the motives of all pernicious citizens. The Engli&s;h JACOBINS, as well as the FRENCH, may find their picture drawn by the ma&s;terly pencil of Tacitus. <HI>Fal&s;o</HI> LIBERTATIS <HI>nomen obtendi ab &uuml;s, qui</HI> PRIVA|TIM DEGENERES, <HI>in publicum</HI> EXITIOSI, <HI>nihil &s;pei ni&s;i per di&s;cordias habeant</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ann. Lib. xi. S. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>While our home-bred Factions were em|ployed at <HI>Sheffield, Norwich, Manche&s;ter, London,</HI> and other places, in laying the &s;eed|plots of Rebellion, this country was on a &s;udden involved in a ju&s;t, a nece&s;&s;ary, an UNAVOIDABLE War. Unavoidable it mu&s;t be called, &s;ince the REGICIDES thought fit to be the AGGRESSORS. This point has been warmly controverted, and much ink has been lavi&s;hed on the &s;ubject. The pre&s;ent writer does not mean to enter the li&s;ts with any per&s;on whatever: he only claims a right to think for him&s;elf, and, with all po&s;&s;ible brevity, to exhibit the light in which things appeared to him.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that Great Britain pro|voked the war by the recall of her Amba&s;&s;ador. But that event took place after the 10th of
<PB N="ix" REF="6">Augu&s;t, 1792, when the King of France was &s;u&s;pended from all the functions of his office, and &s;ent, with the Royal Family, a pri&s;oner to the Temple. The credentials of the Amba&s;|&s;ador were then no longer valid. With whom was he to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s? Was it to be matter of indifference, whether he negotiated with the King, to whom he was &s;ent, or with the BRISSOTS, the MARATS, the ROBE|SPIERES, and the re&s;t of that Pandaemonium? Would &s;uch a conduct have been &s;uited to the honour of the Briti&s;h Nation? It would have been nothing &s;hort of a decided part in the internal affairs of France. Had LORD GOWER remained at Paris, he would have been in a precarious &s;ituation. He had &s;een the ma&s;&s;acre of the 10th of Augu&s;t: Was he to wait for that of the 2d of September, when no le&s;s than three thou&s;and men, women, and children, were mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly murdered? The French have lately &s;hewn that they can trample on the rights of amba&s;&s;adors: They confined the amba&s;&s;ador of Portugal in a pri&s;on, and might have behaved with equal in&s;olence to LORD GOWER. In &s;uch a junc|ture, his Maje&s;ty thought it became his dig|nity to &s;end letters of recall, declaring, at the
<PB N="x" REF="7">&s;ame time, that he would not interfere in the internal government of that kingdom. If the French, who are now <HI>affiliating,</HI> that is en|&s;laving GENEVA, will enquire for the works of BURLAMAQUI, they will find that the re|call of an amba&s;&s;ador, or a refu&s;al to receive one, may proceed from various cau&s;es, with|out being deemed a &s;ufficient provocation of war. It &s;hould &s;eem that the French them|&s;elves were of that opinion, &s;ince it appears, that M. LE BRUN, at that time Mini&s;ter for Foreign Affairs, in his an&s;wer to the com|munication made to him by LORD GOWER, expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h, <HI>that a full reciprocity of ju&s;tice and good-will might &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two countries.</HI></P>
<P>With what &s;incerity the Republican Anar|chi&s;ts acted on that occa&s;ion, may be inferred from their Decree of the 19th November, 1792, by which they promi&s;ed fraternity and &s;upport to the People of every country, who wi&s;hed to overturn their Government. It is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to add, that in an&s;wer to <HI>Fro&s;t</HI> and <HI>Joel Barlow,</HI> the Pre&s;ident of the Convention hoped the day was not far di&s;tant, <HI>when he &s;hould &s;end congratulations to a &s;imilar National Convention in England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="8">
It is well known, that an inundation of French Jacobins, whom their <HI>o'ercloy'd coun|try vomited forth</HI> to propagate their dete&s;table principles, infe&s;ted every part of London: In &s;uch a period the ALIEN BILL was a wife and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure: and it may now well be a que&s;tion, whether it ought not to be declared perpetual. Whenever a Peace &s;hall be con|cluded, a banditti of Frenchmen, under the pretext of trade and commerce, will be &s;ent over to wage a war of principles again&s;t the Government.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year 1792, the demagogues of Paris were re&s;olved on two grand objects, namely, the murder of their King, and a war with Great Britain. The former was executed on the 21&s;t of January 1793; on the 24th of the &s;ame month M. Chauvelin received orders to depart. Though it was well known, that long before that time he had renounced his King, who had &s;ent him hither, and &s;worn fidelity to his new ma&s;ters; and though his machinations in this country were well known, he was, notwith&s;tanding, &s;uffered to remain as long as Lewis XVI. was permitted to live. His
<PB N="xii" REF="9">credentials expired with his martyred Sove|reign. His character of amba&s;&s;ador was ter|minated by the fatal murder of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. To have received him with new credentials from the regicides, would have been incompatible with the moral dignity of the Briti&s;h Nation.</P>
<P>The rulers of Paris, having de&s;troyed their, King, proceeded to their long-projected war again&s;t Great Britain. In their debate on that &s;ubject, on the 1&s;t of February 1793, it was a&s;&s;erted by one of their orators, <HI>That the watchful conduct of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ters, their fears, and jealou&s;ies afforded proofs</HI> of the <HI>progre&s;s of the opinions and principles of the French Revolution</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See Debrett's Collection of Addre&s;&s;es from Engli&s;h Clubs, publi&s;hed in the year 1793.</NOTE> Is not that avowal from the mouth of an enemy, a full ju&s;tification of the ALIEN BILL? It was further a&s;&s;erted by <HI>Bri&s;&s;ot,</HI> that the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ters, for the &s;ake of the trade and commerce of England, ob|&s;erved a STRICT NEUTRALITY. If corrobo|rating proof of this pacific di&s;po&s;ition were ne|ce&s;&s;ary, we have the authority of the MARQUIS DE BOUILLE. That great Officer, known and
<PB N="xiii" REF="10">re&s;pected throughout Europe, informs us, that he attended the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and the Emperor Leopold at Pilnitz, on the 22d of Augu&s;t, 1791, when the&s;e two powers formed a Treaty of Alliance; and in the month of September following, he was received in the Cabinet at Vienna, and there the Emperor told him, that he had been waiting for an|&s;wers from the Courts of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia, Spain, Eng|land,</HI> and the principal Sovereigns of Italy, and had at length received them, and was <HI>a&s;&s;ured of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and co-operation of all tho&s;e powers,</HI> EXCEPT ENGLAND, which had expre&s;&s;ed its determination to OBSERVE A STRICT NEUTRALITY <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See the Marquis de Bouille's Memoirs of the French Revolution, page 422.</NOTE></P>
<P>What, in the mean time, was the real di&s;|po&s;ition of the French towards Great Bri|tain? Mr. HARPER, one of the Repre&s;enta|tives in the American Congre&s;s, has laid open the intrigues, the &s;tratagems, and over-bear|ing in&s;olence of the French, from the very beginning of the Revolution. He tells us in expre&s;s terms, that their grand object was to de&s;troy the trade of Great Britain. <Q><HI>And
<PB N="xiv" REF="11">this was to be effected by &s;etting fire to the four corners of Europe, and exciting the People in every quarter to in&s;urrection again&s;t their Go|vernment. A project &s;o atrocious in its end, and &s;o abominable in its means, has never been conceived before. And while all this was going on, the Convention, in order to hood|wink England, was making to her the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of pacific intentions. It even carried its di&s;&s;imulation to the almo&s;t incredi|ble length of reque&s;ting the mediation of Eng|land to bring about a Peace with Pru&s;&s;ia and the Emperor. In the mean time, their in|&s;tructions to</HI> GENET, <HI>(their Envoy to Ame|rica) &s;hewed, that it was their manife&s;t ob|ject to draw the United States into a war with Great Britain. Tho&s;e in&s;tructions were dated January 3d, 1793. Supplementary in&s;truc|tions were delivered by the &s;ame per&s;on, Ja|nuary 17th, 1793. Louis XVI. was guillo|tined January 21&s;t, 1793; Chauvelin was ordered to quit England, January 24th, 1793, and war was declared again&s;t England on the 1&s;t of February following. If the di&s;mi&s;&s;al of Chauvelin was the occa&s;ion of the war, as France alledged, why tho&s;e in&s;tructions on the 3d of January &s;o long before the di&s;mi&s;&s;al?
<PB N="xv" REF="12">The Leaders of Oppo&s;ition in England have long per&s;i&s;ted in the error of regarding only the</HI> DECLARATIONS <HI>of France, and wholly over|looking her</HI> ACTIONS <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See Harper's Pamphlet, Page 94, 95.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>If the war was at fir&s;t unavoidable, it is now ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, as appears from the behaviour of the Directory to LORD MAL|MESBURY. That Nobleman, inve&s;ted with the character of Plenipotentiary, offered in the very out&s;et of the negotiation at <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> the terms of Peace drawn up in the form of a Treaty, which the enemy, had they been in earne&s;t, might have embraced with little or no delay; but, contrary to all precedent, they recalled at the end of near three months, the Plenipotentiaries, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the thread of the whole negotiation, and &s;ent two new Agents to <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> with a &s;ettled de&s;ign, in the mo&s;t abrupt manner, to end all further Treaty. Tho&s;e new Agents by a note, dated the 16th of September, de&s;ired to know whe|ther Lord Malme&s;bury had powers to give up to France and her Allies, all places con|quered by Great Britain. They were told by his Lord&s;hip, that a deci&s;ive an&s;wer in the
<PB N="xvi" REF="13">negative had been given on the 24th of July preceding. This was of no weight. A Peer of Great Britain, and a Plenipotentiary Am|ba&s;&s;ador, was ordered in the mo&s;t in&s;olent manner to go and return, that is to fetch and carry for an in&s;olent Directory, who have emerged from ob&s;curity, to be the ty|rants of their country. This demand of a general re&s;titution is the more extravagant, becau&s;e after the three great and glorious vic|tories, unparalleled in the Briti&s;h Annals, by LORD HOWE over the French, by LORD ST. VINCENT over the Spaniards, and la&s;tly, by LORD DUNCAN over the Dutch, it is not in their power to retake any one place that has been conquered from them. Rafts and gun|boats will not be able to cope with the Briti&s;h Navy.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;ked in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, <HI>"Are we to per&s;i&s;t in the war for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Cape of</HI> GOOD HOPE, <HI>the I&s;land of</HI> CEYLON, <HI>and Trincomale?"</HI> The following Extract from the Marquis de Bouille's Me|moirs, will be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the que&s;|tion. "In the &s;ummer of 1784," &s;ays that great General, <Q>when I was preparing to &s;et out from BERLIN to RUSSIA, I received an
<PB N="xvii" REF="14">order from Government to return to Paris. On my arrival there, the Mini&s;ter ac|quainted me with a project relative to the Ea&s;t Indies. The object was, to unite the French and Dutch forces in an attack upon the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to re&s;tore to the Princes of the Country the Provinces conquered from them by the Engli&s;h, and to obtain and &s;ecure for the two nations Factories and Commercial E&s;tabli&s;hments, which were to be free to the whole world. The means employed to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s to this enterprize, were an army of 18,000 men, independent of the garri&s;ons already in that country; twenty millions of livres in &s;pecie, and a Naval force able to op|po&s;e that of the Engli&s;h in the Ea&s;t Indies. TRINCOMALE, in the I&s;land of CEYLON, was the place de&s;tined for the rendezvous of the troops, and the repo&s;itory of the military magazines. One third of the forces, as well as of the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary, and the &s;tores and provi&s;ions of every kind were to be furni&s;hed by the Dutch, who reque&s;ted that I &s;hould have the command of the expedition. In 1787, the Revolu|tion broke out in Holland; but was &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="xviii" REF="15">pre&s;&s;ed by the entry of a Pru&s;&s;ian army under the command of the DUKE OF BRUNSWICK. All the bonds which united FRANCE and HOLLAND were di&s;&s;olved, the former ba&s;ely abandoning her Ally, and thus the va&s;t project of the conque&s;t of the Indies vani&s;hed into air <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">The Marquis de Bouille's Memoirs, Page 41.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that the above project was in 1784, not more than a year after a General Peace, when nothing had occurred that could give umbrage to France. The &s;ame rooted aver&s;ion to this country '&s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and is openly avowed by the Direc|tory: and, after this &s;tatement, is TRINCO|MALE an object of importance to this coun|try? Shall it be given up to be the rendez|vous of the enemy's troops, and the repo&s;i|tory of their magazines? To do it, were to be <HI>felo de &s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the return of Lord Malme&s;bury, the Directory have waged a war of Billin&s;|gate again&s;t this country. With &s;currility, calumny, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehoods, they have attempted to traduce and vilify a great nation, celebrated throughout Europe for its
<PB N="xix" REF="16">humanity no le&s;s than its valour. They have declared that the Engli&s;h are a generous people labouring under a bad government, and they are determined to give them on the the Royal Exchange a better con&s;titution. Infatuated men! They had in the begin|ning of their Revolution the Briti&s;h Con&s;ti|tution as a model to imitate, but they pre|ferred Anarchy. As Monte&s;quieu expre&s;&s;es it, they had BYZANTIUM before their eyes, and they built CHALCEDON. They have <HI>af|filiated</HI> HOLLAND, BELGIUM, the States of Italy, and GENEVA, and they have robbed and plundered them all. It now remains for them to de&s;troy the Commerce of Great Britain, and to erect their TRI-COLOURED FLAG on the Royal Exchange. For this pur|po&s;e they have &s;olicited &s;ub&s;criptions in their own exhau&s;ted country, but by that mea&s;ure they rouzed the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h Nation. All degrees and ranks of men have con&s;pired with emulation to &s;trengthen the hands of Government, and from the Contributions paid in at the Bank, three things are mani|fe&s;t: Fir&s;t, that the people are united, with one mind, one heart, one hand, again&s;t the
<PB N="xx" REF="17">attempts of a French banditti: Secondly, that this is an opulent country, ready and willing to &s;trengthen the hands of Govern|ment: And thirdly, the Voluntary Sub&s;crip|tions &s;hew, that all ranks and orders of men repo&s;e entire confidence in his Maje&s;ty's Councils, and his pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters. The con&s;equence of this unanimity and firmne&s;s, it is hoped, will be the &s;upport of the exten|&s;ive commerce of this country, and the em|pire of the &s;ea.</P>

<P>The &s;ituation, it mu&s;t be granted, forms an awful period, and requires collected vi|gour, nothing le&s;s than the whole force of the community. And yet, at the &s;ame time, we &s;till hear a clamour for RADICAL RE|FORM. That men of eminence in the &s;tate &s;hould at length join in &s;uch a cry is not a little &s;urprizing. It may, therefore, not be improper to remind them, that on the trial of HARDY at the Old Baily, a letter to him
<PB N="xxi" REF="18">from the Society at <HI>Norwich</HI> was produced, containing the following pa&s;&s;age: <Q><HI>Whether it is the private de&s;ign of the &s;everal Societies to rip</HI> UP MONARCHY BY THE ROOTS, <HI>and place</HI> DEMOCRACY <HI>in its &s;tead?</HI></Q> What was the an&s;wer? <Q><HI>The Committee offer you every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, but reque&s;t that your que&s;tions for the future may relate chiefly to</HI> REFORM OF PARLIAMENT.</Q> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Hardy's Trial, by Gurney, Vol. I. Page 223, 225</NOTE> This the Corre&s;ponding Society avow as their o&s;ten&s;ible object, but conceal their intention with regard to Monarchy. When men of rank and ability allow them&s;elves, after all their efforts, to adopt the &s;ame clamour, they run the ri&s;k of being thought to follow HARDY'S advice. Who&s;e advice they follow. when their voice is rai&s;ed again&s;t every mea|&s;ure of Government, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay. The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the HABEAS CORPUS ACT is called a violent &s;tep, nothing le&s;s than a violation of the Con&s;titution, an encroach|ment on the liberty of the &s;ubject, and, in &s;hort, a manife&s;t prelude to the reign of terror. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this intem|perate language is, that no proof of exi&s;t|ing
<PB N="xxii" REF="19">plots again&s;t the State has been produced in Parliament. But that the Jacobins at <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and other places, have been en|gaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t this country is evident beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt. And &s;urely, the power of providing for the &s;afety of a whole people is inherent in the frame and &s;pirit of the Con&s;titution. Let us hear what a WHIG of the OLD SCHOOL has &s;aid upon the &s;ubject. <Q><HI>It is an ab&s;ur|dity to imagine that tho&s;e, who have the au|thority of making laws, cannot &s;u&s;pend any particular law, when they think it expedient for the public. When, therefore, any law does not conduce to this great end, the very ob&s;ervation of it would endanger the commu|nity, and that law ought to be laid a&s;leep for a limited time by proper authority. Every government mu&s;t in its nature be armed with &s;uch a power. There cannot be a greater in|&s;tance of this, than in the old Commonwealth of Rome, who flattered them&s;elves with an opinion, that their government had in it a due temper of the Regal, Noble, and Popular Power, repre&s;ented by the Con&s;uls, the Sena|tors, and the Tribunes. Neverthele&s;s, in this government, when the Republic was threatened

<P>The clamour of a few again&s;t the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law is not the only mi&s;|chief of the times. A MONSTER IN POLI|TICS has lately &s;talked forth as formidable as that de&s;cribed by LUCRETIUS,</P>
<P><HI>Horribili &s;uper a&s;pectu mortalibus in&s;tans:</HI></P>
<P>This Phantom is, <Q>The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE;</Q> a FOURTH ESTATE &s;et up in a country, that has been for ages governed by the Legi&s;lative Autho|rity of THREE. If there is &s;uch a new order, it is of cour&s;e paramount to KING, LORDS, and COMMONS, and, by con&s;equence,
<PB N="xxv" REF="22">there is an end of our boa&s;ted Con&s;titution. But where has this <Q>SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE</Q> ever exi&s;ted? At ATHENS the people had a &s;hare in the go|vernment, and the citizens of Rome, by their TRIBUNES, a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed enor|mous influence; but they had no SOVE|REIGN MAJESTY. In proce&s;s of time they both wrought their own ruin. The &s;ubjects of Great Britain are much wi&s;er; they dele|gate their whole authority to their Repre|&s;entatives, and beyond that power they claim no authority. If <Q>The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE</Q> ever exi&s;ted in any part of the known world, it mu&s;t have been in a pure, unmixed, and per&s;ect DEMOCRACY. And where can &s;uch a go|vernment be traced? Polybius &s;ays, <Q>Ru&s;t is the inbred bane of iron, and worms of wood; and as tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances at la&s;t fall a prey to the evils that are congenial to their nature, in the <HI>&s;ame manner every</HI> SINGLE KIND OF GOVERNMENT <HI>breeds within it&s;elf &s;ome certain vice, which &s;oon cau&s;es its de&s;truction.

<PB N="xxvi" REF="23">Violence</HI> <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See Polybius, Book vi. Chap, i.</NOTE>.</Q> Such is the natural progre&s;s of the &s;imple forms of government. A mixed limited Monarchy has, in its well tempered contexture, the means within it&s;elf of checking every mi&s;chief: and till a wild Democracy has overturned all whole|&s;ome laws, <Q>The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE</Q> is gigantic non&s;en&s;e, <Q><HI>full of &s;ound and fury, &s;ignifying nothing.</HI></Q>.</P>
<P>The REFORM projected by the JACOBINS of this country, would, beyond all doubt, <HI>rip up the Con&s;titution by the roots.</HI> At &s;uch a time, the Author of the following Scenes thought, if he could recall the minds of men to the origin and antiquity of the Con&s;titution, under which the people have enjoyed their rights, their property, and their liberty for above five hundred years, his labours might have &s;ome tendency to &s;top the progre&s;s of the new philo&s;ophy, and check the &s;pirit of innovation. Our form of government, as Mote&s;quieu has truly ob&s;erved, came to this country from the woods of Germany <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des Loix, Book</NOTE>. GAUL was reduced to a &s;tate of &s;lavery, while Germany di&s;played a &s;pirit of inde|pendance.
<PB N="xxvii" REF="24">Arminius was the Great Hero of Germany. TACITUS tells us, That <Q>he fought with alternate vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune: a man of warlike genius; and, beyond all que&s;tion, the deliverer of Ger|many. He had not, like the Kings and Generals of a former day, the infancy of Rome to cope with; he had to &s;truggle with a great and flouri&s;hing Empire: he attacked the Romans in the meridian of their glory; he &s;tood at bay for a number of years with equivocal &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ometimes victorious, often defeated, but in the i&s;&s;ue of the war, STILL UNCONQUERED. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Annal. Lib. II. S. 88.</NOTE></Q> It was from that northern hive that our Saxon ance&s;tors brought with them the &s;ame &s;pirit of liberty, and a plan of civil government. They had experienced in their own country the di&s;advantages of the general &s;uffrage of the people in a ma&s;s; they had occa&s;ionally tried the more practicable mode of repre&s;en|tation: <HI>Ut mi&s;&s;is Legatis in Commune Con&s;ulta|rent, Libertas an Pax Placeret.</HI> They had recour&s;e to the &s;ame expedient in England. The WITTENAGEMOT was accordingly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
<PB N="xxviii" REF="25">con&s;i&s;ting of the King, the Barons, and the Saxon Freemen. The inferior orders of the people were &s;till in bondage, but the remedy was &s;oon applied. Letters of enfran|chi&s;ement were granted not only to individu|als, but to the inhabitants of towns and cities, who were admitted by their Repre&s;en|tatives to a voice in the Great Council of the Nation. The con&s;equence was, that the kingly power, the privileges of the nobility and clergy, and the rights of the commons were &s;o happily blended, that "I believe," &s;ays Monte&s;quieu, <Q>&s;o happy a form of Go|vernment never pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the mind of man <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des Loix. Lib. xi. Cap. vi, viii.</NOTE>.</Q> The Great Council of the Nation, called under the ANGLO SAXON GO|VERNMENT, the WITTENAGEMOT, in proce&s;s of time took the name of PARLIAMENT, and from that period has been the <HI>Palladium</HI> of Briti&s;h Liberty; a noble fabric, which our internal enemies would fain demoli&s;h by what they call a RADICAL REFORM.</P>
<P>It is, however, to be hoped that a venera|tion for the antiquity of &s;o glorious a Con|&s;titution, and a due &s;en&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings,
<PB N="xxix" REF="26">which mankind have enjoyed under it, will animate all true Engli&s;hmen again&s;t their enemies, whether foreign or dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>The Author of Arminius has had the plea&s;ure of working under a great ma&s;ter, and in the Notes annexed to the Tragedy, he has cited the pa&s;&s;ages which he has imitated, becau&s;e he knows that the &s;entiments will come with weight and authority from the great writer of political hi&s;tory. That he has not been able to execute up to his own ideas and wi&s;hes, he is too con&s;cious; but for a well-meant endeavour no apology can be required.</P>
