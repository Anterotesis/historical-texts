<LG>
<L>OUR Author, who accu&s;es great and &s;mall,</L>
<L>And &s;ays &s;o boldly, there are faults in all;</L>
<L>Sends me with di&s;mal voice, and lengthen'd phiz,</L>
<L>Humbly to own one dreadful fault of his:</L>
<L>A fault, in modern Authors not uncommon,</L>
<L>It is,&mdash;now don't be angry&mdash;He's&mdash;<HI>a woman.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can you forgive it? Nay, I'll tell you more,</L>
<L>One who has dar'd to venture here before;</L>
<L>Has &s;een your &s;miles, your frowns,&mdash;tremendous &s;ight!</L>
<L>O, be not in a frowning mood to-night!</L>
<L>The Play, perhaps, has many things ami&s;s:</L>
<L>Well, let us then reduce the point to this,</L>
<L>Let only tho&s;e that have no failings, hi&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>The Rights of Women,</HI> &s;ays a female pen,</L>
<L>Are, to do every thing as well as Men.</L>
<L>To think, to argue, to decide, to write,</L>
<L>To talk, undoubtedly&mdash;perhaps, to fight.</L>
<L>[For Females march to war, like brave Commanders,</L>
<L>Not in old Authors only&mdash;but in Flanders.]</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I grant this matter may be &s;train'd too far,</L>
<L>And Maid 'gain&s;t Man is mo&s;t uncivil war:</L>
<L>I Grant, as all my City friends will &s;ay,</L>
<L>That Men &s;hould rule, and Women &s;hould obey:</L>
<L>That nothing binds the marriage contract fa&s;ter,</L>
<L>Than our&mdash;a "Zounds, Madam, I'm your Lord and Ma&s;ter."</L>
<L>I grant their nature, and their frailty &s;uch,</L>
<L>Women may make too free&mdash;and know too much.</L>
<L>But &s;ince the Sex at length has been inclin'd</L>
<L>To cultivate that u&s;eful part&mdash;the mind;&mdash;</L>
<L>Since they have learnt to read, to write, to &s;pell;&mdash;</L>
<L>Since &s;ome of them have wit,&mdash;and u&s;e it well;&mdash;</L>
<L>Let us not force them back with brow &s;evere,</L>
<L>Within the pale of ignorance and fear,</L>
<L><PB REF="3">Confin'd entirely to dome&s;tic arts,</L>

<L>The fav'rite fable of the tuneful Nine,</L>

<L>Then, drive not, Critics, with tyrannic rage,</L>
<L>A &s;upplicating Fair-one from the Stage;</L>
<L>The Comic Mu&s;e perhaps is growing old,</L>

<P>I &s;ay the &s;ame by you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet your &s;ingularity plea&s;es me; for you are the fir&s;t elderly bachelor I ever knew, who did not hug him&s;elf in the reflection, that he was not in the trammels of wedlock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I am only the fir&s;t elderly bachelor who has truth and courage enough to confe&s;s his di&s;&s;a|tisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you really wi&s;h you were married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do. I wi&s;h &s;till more, that I had been married thirty years ago. Oh! I wi&s;h a wife and half-a-&s;core children would now &s;tart up around me, and bring along with them all that affection, which we &s;hould have had for each other by being ear|lier acquainted. But as it is, in my pre&s;ent &s;tate, there is not a per&s;on in the world I care a &s;traw for; and the world is pretty even with me, for I don't believe there is a creature in it who cares a &s;traw for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;haw! You have in your time been a man of gallantry; and, con&s;equently, mu&s;t have made many attachments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;uch as men of gallantry u&s;ually make. I have been attached to women who have purloined my fortune, and to men who have partaken of the theft: I have been in as much fear of my mi&s;tre&s;s as you are of your wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that po&s;&s;ible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and without having one of tho&s;e tender, delicate ties of a hu&s;band, an excu&s;e for my ap|prehen&s;ion.&mdash;I have maintained children&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you complain for the want of a family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not &s;ay I ever had any children; I &s;aid I had <HI>maintained</HI> them; but I never believed they were mine; for I could have no dependence upon the principles of their mother&mdash;and never did I
<PB N="3" REF="6">
take one of tho&s;e tender infants in my arms, that the forehead of my Valet, the &s;quint-eye of my Apothecary, or the double-chin of my Chaplain, did not &s;tare me in the face, and damp all the fine feelings of the parent, which I had ju&s;t call|ed up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tho&s;e are accidents which may occur in the marriage &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that ca&s;e, a man is pitied&mdash;in mine, he is only laughed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h to heaven I could exchange the pity which my friends be&s;tow on me, for the merriment which your ill fate excites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You want but courage to be envied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does any one doubt my courage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. If a Prince were to offend you, you would challenge him, I have no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my wife offend me, I am obliged to make an apology.&mdash;Was not that her voice? I hope &s;he has not overheard our conver&s;ation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If &s;he have, &s;he'll be in an ill humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>That &s;he will be, whether &s;he have heard it or not.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, good-day. I don't like to be driven from my fixed plan of wedlock; and, therefore, I won't be a &s;pectator of your mutual di&s;content.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Going.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But before you go, Mr. Solus, permit me to remind you of a certain concern, that, I think, would afford you much more delight, than all you can, at this time of life, propo&s;e to your&s;elf in marriage. Make happy by your beneficence, a near relation whom the true&s;t affection has drawn into that &s;tate, but who is denied the ble&s;&s;ing of competency to make the &s;tate &s;upportable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean my nephew, Irwin? But do not you acknowledge he has a wife and children? Did not he marry the woman he loved, and has he not, at this moment, a large family, by whom he is beloved? And is he not, therefore, with all his poverty, much happier than I? He has often told me, when I have reproached him with his indi&s;creet marriage, "that in his wife he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed kingdoms!" Do you &s;uppo&s;e I will give any part of my fortune to a man who enjoys &s;uch exten|&s;ive domains? No:&mdash;let him pre&s;erve his terri|tories, and I will keep my little e&s;tate for my own u&s;e. <STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Cou&s;in, cou&s;in Harmony, I will not forgive you for thus continually &s;peaking in the behalf of every &s;ervant whom you find me offended with. Your philanthropy becomes in&s;upportable; and, in&s;tead of being a virtue, degenerates into a vice.</P>

<P>Dear Madam, do not upbraid me for a con&s;titu|tional fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> SPINSTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; you had it from your infancy. I have heard your mother &s;ay you were always fooli&s;hly tender-hearted, and never &s;hewed one of tho&s;e di&s;criminating pa&s;&s;ions of envy, hatred, or revenge, to which all her other children were liable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: &s;ince I can remember, I have felt the mo&s;t unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures. I even prote&s;t to you, dear Madam, that, as I walk along the &s;treets of this large metropolis, &s;o warm is my heart towards every per&s;on who pa&s;&s;es me, that I long to &s;ay, "How do you do?" and
<PB N="10" REF="13">
"I am glad to &s;ee you," to them all. Some men, I &s;hould like even to &s;top and &s;hake hands with;&mdash; and &s;ome women, I &s;hould like even to &s;top and ki&s;s.</P>

<P>How can you be &s;o ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, 'tis truth: and I &s;incerely lament that hu|man beings &s;hould be &s;uch &s;trangers to one another as we are. We live in the &s;ame &s;treet, without knowing one another's nece&s;&s;ities; and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church, at cof|fee-hou&s;es, play-hou&s;es, and all public places, without ever &s;peaking a &s;ingle word, or nodding "Good bye!" though 'tis a hundred chances to ten we never &s;ee one another again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> SPINSTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, kin&s;man, all this pretended philanthropy renders you ridiculous. There is not a fraud, a theft, or hardly any vice com|mitted, that you do not take the criminal's part, &s;hake your head, and cry, "Provi&s;ions are &s;o &s;carce!" And no longer ago than la&s;t Lord-mayor's-day, when you were told that Mr. Alder|man Ravenous was ill with an indige&s;tion, you en|deavoured to &s;often the matter, by exclaiming, "Provi&s;ions are &s;o &s;carce!"&mdash;But, above all, I condemn that fal&s;e humanity, which induces you to &s;ay many things in conver&s;ation which de&s;erve to &s;tigmatize you with the character of deceit.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a weakne&s;s I confe&s;s. But though my honour &s;ometimes reproaches me with it as a fault, my con&s;cience never does: for it is by this very failing that I have frequently made the bittere&s;t

<P>I TELL you, Mr. Harmony, that if an indif|ferent per&s;on, one on whom I had never be&s;towed a favour in my life, were to offend me, it is in my nature never to forgive. Can I then forgive my own daughter, my only child, on whom I heaped continually marks of the mo&s;t affectionate fondne&s;s?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your child, con&s;ider.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>The weake&s;t argument you can u&s;e. As my child, was not &s;he mo&s;t bound to obey me? As my child, ought &s;he not to have &s;acrificed her own happine&s;s to mine? In&s;tead of which, mine has been yielded up for a whim, a fancy, a fancy to marry a beggar; and as &s;uch is her choice, let her beg with him.</P>

<P>If I thought &s;he dared to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to me, though dictated on her knees, &s;he &s;hould find

<P>I have no doubt of it: and, that I may not be the means of aggravating your di&s;plea&s;ure, I a&s;&s;ure you, that what I have now &s;aid has been entirely from my&s;elf, without any de&s;ire of hers; and, at the &s;ame time, I give you my promi&s;e, I will never pre&s;ume to intrude the &s;ubject again.</P>

<P>I would have concealed it from all the world; I wi&s;hed it even unknown to my&s;elf.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you;&mdash;and in compa&s;&s;ion to the child, give you my <HI>&s;olemn promi&s;e</HI> never to reveal who he is. I have heard that tho&s;e unfortunate parents left an infant behind when they went abroad, and that they now lament him as lo&s;t.

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you &s;uppo&s;e I &s;earched for him? No;&mdash;he was forced upon me. A woman followed me, about eight years ago, in the fields adjoining to
<PB N="46" REF="49">
my country &s;eat, with a half-&s;tarved boy in her hand, and a&s;ked my charity for my grand-child: the impre&s;&s;ion of the word, made me turn round involuntarily; and ca&s;ting my eyes upon him, I was rejoiced, not to find a feature of his mother's in all his face; and I began to feel &s;omething like pity for him. In &s;hort, he caught &s;uch fa&s;t hold by one of my fingers, that I a&s;ked him carele&s;sly "if he would go home and live with me?" On which, he an&s;wered me &s;o willingly "Yes," I took him at his word.</P>

Mr. Solus, how do you do? I am extremely &s;orry that my enagagements take me away as &s;oon as you enter. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Harmony <HI>running, to avoid an explanation.</HI></STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Robert, what is the matter? Has any thing ruffled you? Why, I never &s;aw you look more out of temper, even while you were married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that I had never married! never known what marriage was! for, even at this moment, I feel its torments in my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often heard of the torments of matri|mony; but I conceive, that at the wor&s;t, they are nothing more than a kind of violent tickling, which will force the tears into your eyes, though at the &s;ame time you are bur&s;ting your &s;ides with laughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have defined marriage too favourably; there is no laughter in the &s;tate: all is melancholy, all gloom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy for the &s;pleen. I have known a Gentleman at a fea&s;t receive an affront, di&s;gui&s;e his rage, &s;tep home, vent it all upon his wife, return to his com|panions, and be as good company as if nothing had happened.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But even the nece&s;&s;ary expences of a wife &s;hould alarm you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="67">
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can then retrench &s;ome of my own. Oh! my dear Sir, a married man has &s;o many delightful privileges to what a bachelor has!&mdash;An old Lady will introduce her daughters to you in a di&s;habille &mdash;"It does not &s;ignify, my dears, it's a married man"&mdash;One Lady will &s;uffer you to draw on her glove&mdash;"Never mind, it's a married man"&mdash; Another will permit you to pull on her &s;lipper; a third will even take you into her bed-chamber &mdash;"P&s;haw, it's <HI>nothing</HI> but a married man."</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the weight of your fetters will overbalance all the&s;e joys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And I cannot &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding you are re|lieved from the bond, that I &s;ee much joy or brightne&s;s here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not very well at pre&s;ent; I have the head|ach; and, if ever a wife can be of comfort to her hu&s;band, it mu&s;t be when he is indi&s;po&s;ed. A wife, then, binds up your head, mixes your powders, bathes your temples, and hovers about, in a way that is mo&s;t endearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't &s;peak of it; I long to have one hover about me. But I will&mdash;I am determined I will, before I am a week older. Don't &s;peak, don't at|tempt to per&s;uade me not. Your de&s;cription has renewed my eagerne&s;s&mdash;I will be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without pretending not to know who you mean to make your wife, I tell you plainly, it is, Mi&s;s Wooburn, it is my late wife.&mdash;I know you

made overtures to my Lord Norland, and that he has given his con&s;ent.</P>

<P>That is right, Sir; marry her, marry her;&mdash;I give you joy,&mdash;that's all.&mdash;Ha, ha, ha! I think I &s;hould know her temper.&mdash;But if you will venture to, marry her, I &s;incerely wi&s;h you happy.</P>

<P>That, I cannot &s;end in. But tell him, Sir, I am the afflicted wife of a man, who for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t has given many fatal proofs of a di&s;ordered mind.

But his paroxy&s;m over, he &s;hrunk from what he had done, and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken, into a &s;ervant's hands to be returned to its lawful owner. The man, admitted to this confidence, betrayed his tru&s;t, and in&s;tead of giving up what was &s;o &s;acredly delivered to him, &s;ecreted it; and, to obtain the promi&s;ed reward, came to this hou&s;e, but to in|form again&s;t the wretched offender; who now, only re&s;ting on your Lord's clemency, can e&s;cape the direful fate he has incurred.</P>

<P>And yet, my good friends, notwith&s;tanding the merit you may attribute to me, I have one mo&s;t tremendous fault; and it weighs &s;o heavy on my con&s;cience, I would confe&s;s what it is, but that you might hereafter call my veracity in que&s;tion.</P>

<L>When &s;uited years, and pliant tempers join,</L>

<L>As the lov'd offspring of the happy pair</L>
<L>Oft climb the knee, the envied ki&s;s to &s;hare.</L>

<L>Such joys this happy country long has known,</L>
<L>Rear'd in the Cot, reflected from the Throne;</L>
