<L>Lo! Di&s;cord enters at the &s;acred Porch,</L>
<L>Rage in her Frown, and Terror on her Cre&s;t:</L>

<L>Three Lu&s;tres &s;carce with ha&s;ty Wing were fled,</L>

<L>The pealing Organ's animating Sound,</L>
<L>The choral Virgins' captivating Voice,</L>
<L>The blazing Altar, and the Prie&s;ts around:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Train of Youths array'd in pure&s;t white,</L>
