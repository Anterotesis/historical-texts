<L>I COME not to announce a ba&s;hful maid</L>
<L>Who ne'er has try'd the drama's doubtful trade,</L>
<L>Who &s;ees with flutt'ring hope the curtain ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;cans with timid glance your critic eyes;</L>
<L>My client is a more experienc'd dame,</L>
<L>Tho' not a Veteran, not unknown to Fame,</L>
<L>Who think your favours are an hone&s;t boa&s;t,</L>
<L>Yet fears to forfeit what &s;he values mo&s;t;</L>
<L>Who has, &s;he tru&s;ts, &s;ome character to lo&s;e,</L>
<L>E'en tho' the woman did not aid the Mu&s;e;</L>
<L>Who courts with mode&s;t aim the public &s;mile,</L>
<L>That &s;tamp of merit, and that meed of toil.</L>
<L>At Athens once (our author has been told)</L>
<L>The Comic Mu&s;e, irregularly bold,</L>
<L>With living calumny profan'd her &s;tage,</L>
<L>And forg'd the frailties of the faultle&s;s &s;age.</L>
<L>Such daring ribaldry you need not fear,</L>
<L>We have no Socrates to libel here.</L>
<L>Ours are the follies of an humbler flight,</L>
<L>Offspring of manners volatile and light;</L>
<L>Our gen'ral &s;atire keeps more knaves in awe,</L>
<L>Our court of con&s;cience comes in aid of law.</L>
<L>Here &s;courg'd by wit, and pilloried by fun,</L>
<L><HI>Ten thou&s;and</HI> coxcombs blu&s;h in&s;tead of <HI>one.</HI></L>
<L>If &s;cenes like the&s;e could make the guilty &s;hrink,</L>
<L>Could teach unfeeling Folly how to think,</L>
<L>Check Affectation's voluble career,</L>
<L>And from cold Fa&s;hion force the &s;truggling tear,</L>
<L>Our author would our loude&s;t prai&s;e forego,</L>
<L>Content to feel within "what pa&s;&s;es &s;how,"</L>
<L>"But &s;ince" (&s;he &s;ays) "&s;uch hopes cannot be mine,</L>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> NORBERRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY blame me?&mdash;Why blame me?&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter had the &s;ole management of your daughter by your own authority; from the age of &s;ix years, till within eight months of the pre&s;ent time, when, in con&s;equence of my &s;i&s;ter's death, &s;he was trans|ferred to my protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;i&s;ter, Mr. Norberry, was a pru|dent, good woman&mdash;&s;he never could in&s;truct her in all this vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, my dear friend, that Mi&s;s Dorrillon, your daughter, came to my hou&s;e ju&s;t the &s;ame heedle&s;s woman of fa&s;hion you now &s;ee her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>impatiently.</STAGE> Very well&mdash;'Tis very well.&mdash;But, when I think on my di&s;appointment&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing which may not be repaired. Maria, with you for a guide&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! She turns me into ridicule&mdash;laughs at me! This morning, as &s;he was enumerating &s;ome of her frivolous expences, &s;he ob&s;erved me lift up my hands and &s;igh; on which &s;he named fifty other extravagances &s;he had no occa&s;ion to men|tion, merely to enjoy the pang which every &s;olly of her &s;ends to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do not charge this conduct of your daughter to the want of filial love:&mdash;did &s;he know you were &s;ir William Dorrillon, did &s;he know you were her father, every word you uttered, every look you glanced, would be received with gentle|ne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion:&mdash;but your pre&s;ent rebukes from Mr. Mandred (as you are called), from a perfect &s;tranger, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, &s;he con&s;iders as an imper|tinence which &s;he has a right to re&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h I had continued abroad. And yet, the hope of beholding her, and of be&s;towing upon her the riches I acquired, was my &s;ole &s;upport through all the toils by which I gained them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, con&s;idering her pre&s;ent cour&s;e of life, your riches could not come more opportunely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>She &s;hall never have a farthing of them. Do you think I have encountered the perils of almo&s;t every climate, to &s;quander my hard-earned fortune upon the paltry vicious plea&s;ures in which &s;he de|lights? No.&mdash;I have been now in your hou&s;e ex|actly a month&mdash;I will &s;tay but one day longer&mdash;and then, without telling her who I am, I will leave the kingdom and her for ever&mdash;Nor &s;hall &s;he know that this in&s;ignificant merchant whom &s;he de&s;pi&s;es, was her father, till he is gone, never to be recalled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are offended with &s;ome ju&s;tice, but, as I have often told you, your exce&s;&s;ive delica|cy and re&s;pect for the conduct of the other &s;ex, de|generate into rigour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;for what I &s;ee &s;o near perfection as woman, I want to &s;ee perfect. <HI>We,</HI> Mr. Norber|ry, can never be perfect; but &s;urely women, wo|men, might ea&s;ily be made angels!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if they were, we &s;hould &s;oon be glad to make them into women again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir William</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>inattentive to Mr. Norberry.</STAGE>
<P>&mdash;She &s;ets the example. <HI>She</HI> gives the fa&s;hion!&mdash;and now your Whole hou&s;e, and all your vi&s;itors, in imitation of <HI>her,</HI> treat me with levity, or with contempt.&mdash;But I'll go away to-morrow.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you de&s;ert your child in the mo|ment &s;he wants your protection? That exqui&s;ite beauty ju&s;t now become mature&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's my difficulty!&mdash;There's my &s;truggle!&mdash;If &s;he were not &s;o like her mother, I could leave her without a pang&mdash;ca&s;t hey off, and think no more of her.&mdash;But that &s;hape! that face! tho&s;e &s;peaking looks!

<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, in all this great town, you may never &s;ee even its apparition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice, however, at the &s;tratagem by which I have gained a knowledge of her heart: de|prived by the means of &s;earching it in her early years, had I at pre&s;ent come as her father, &s;he might have deceived me with counterfeit manners, till time di&s;|clo&s;ed the impo&s;ition.&mdash;Now at lea&s;t, I am not impo&s;ed upon.</P>

<P>Lord Priory!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>An old acquaintance of mine, though we &s;eldom meet. He has &s;ome &s;ingularities; and yet, perhaps&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Lord Priory.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lord, I am glad to &s;ee you. Mr. Mandred <STAGE>introducing Sir Willian.</STAGE> My Lord, I hope I &s;ee you in perfect health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but in very ill humour. I came to London early this morning with my family for the winter, and found my hou&s;e, after going through only a &s;light repair, &s;o damp, that I dare not &s;leep in it: and &s;o I am now &s;ending and going all over the town to &s;eek for lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then &s;eek no farther, but take up your lodgings here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain with you, I called in hopes you would a&s;k me; for I am &s;o delicately &s;crupulous in re&s;pect to lady Priory, that I could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray return home, and bring her hither immediately, with all your luggage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am mo&s;t extremely obliged to you <STAGE>very fervently</STAGE>; for into no one hou&s;e belonging to any of my acquaintance would I take my wife, &s;o &s;oon as into yours. I have now been married eleven years, and during all that time I have made it a rule never to go on a vi&s;it, &s;o as to dome&s;ticate, in the hou&s;e of a married man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I enquire the rea&s;on of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is becau&s;e I am married my&s;elf; and having always treated my wife according to the anci|ent mode of treating wives, I would rather &s;he &s;hould never be an eye-witne&s;s to the modern hou&s;e|hold management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ancients, I believe, were very affec|tionate to their wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they had rea&s;on to be &s;o; for their wives obeyed them. The ancients &s;eldom gave them the liberty to do wrong: but modern wives do as they like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And don't you &s;uffer Lady Priory to do as &s;he likes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when it is what I like too. But never, never el&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does not this draw upon you the cha|racter of an unkind hu&s;band?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am proud of. Did you never ob&s;erve, that &s;eldom a breach of fidelity in a wi&s;e is expo&s;ed where the unfortunate hu&s;band is not &s;aid to be "the be&s;t creature in the world! Poor man, &s;o good-natured!&mdash;Doatingly fond of his wife!&mdash;Indulged her in every thing!&mdash;How cruel in her to &s;erve him &s;o!" Now, if I am &s;erved <HI>&s;o,</HI> it &s;hall not be for my good-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope you equally di&s;approve of every &s;everity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>rapidly.</STAGE> What do you mean by &s;eve|rity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know you u&s;ed to be rather vio|lent in your temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I am &s;till&mdash;apt to be ha&s;ty and pa&s;&s;i|onate
<PB N="5" REF="8">
&mdash;but that is rather of advantage to me as a hu&s;band&mdash;it cau&s;es me to be obeyed without he&s;i|tation&mdash;no liberty for contention, tears, or repin|ing. I in&s;ure conjugal &s;un&s;hine, by now and then introducing a &s;torm; while &s;ome hu&s;bands never &s;ee any thing but a cloudy &s;ky, and all for the want of a little dome&s;tic thunder to clear away the vapours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have long conceived indulgenee to be the bane of female happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o it is.&mdash;I know &s;everal wo|men of fa&s;hion who will vi&s;it &s;ix place of different amu&s;ement on the &s;ame night, have company at home be&s;ides, and yet, for want of &s;omething more, they'll be out of &s;pirits: my wife never goes to a public place, has &s;carce ever company at home, and yet is always in &s;pirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never vi&s;its operas, or balls, or routs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;hould &s;he? She goes to bed every night exactly at ten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the name of wonder, how have you been able to bring her to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>By making her ri&s;e every morning at five.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o &s;he becomes tired before night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tired to death. Or, if I &s;ee her eyes completely open at bed-time, and &s;he a&s;ks me to play one game more at piquet, the next morning I jog her elbow at half after four.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e &s;he does not reply to the &s;ignal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I turn the key of the door when I leave the chamber; and there I find her when I come home in the evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without her having &s;een a creature all day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is in my favour; for not having &s;een a &s;ingle &s;oul, &s;he is rejoiced even to &s;ee <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will &s;he &s;peak to you after &s;uch u&s;age?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you only con&s;idered how much a woman longs to &s;peak after being kept a whole day &s;ilent, you would not a&s;k that que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! this is the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing me|thod!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. In ancient days, when man|ners were &s;imple and pure, did not wives wait at the table of their hu&s;bands? and did not angels witne&s;s the &s;ubordination? I have taught Lady Priory to practi&s;e the &s;ame humble docile obedience&mdash;to pay re&s;pect to her hu&s;band in every &s;hape and every form, no carele&s;s inattention to <HI>me</HI>&mdash;no &s;miling politene&s;s to others in preference to <HI>me</HI>&mdash;&mdash;no putting <HI>me</HI> up in a corner&mdash;in all a&s;&s;emblies, &s;he con&s;iders her hu&s;band as the fir&s;t per&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am impatient to &s;ee her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't expect a fine lady with high feathers; and the <HI>et caetera</HI> of an Ea&s;tern concubine; you will &s;ee a mode&s;t plain English woman, with a cap on her head, a handkerchief on her neck, and a gown of our own manufacture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Norberry, what a contra&s;t mu&s;t there be between Lady Priory and the ladies in this hou&s;e!</P>

<P><STAGE>&s;tarting.</STAGE> Have you ladies in this hou&s;e?</P>

<P>Don't be alarmed; they are both &s;in|gle, and can give Lady Priory no ideas concerning the marriage &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Are you &s;ure of that? Some &s;ingle women are more informed than their friends believe.</P>

<P>Well, then, I and my wife will be with you about nine in the evening; you know we go to-bed at ten.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have now lo&s;t all my money, and all my jewels, at play; it is almo&s;t two years &s;ince I have received a &s;ingle remittance from my father; and Mr. Norberry refu&s;es to advance me a &s;hilling more.&mdash;What I &s;hall do to di&s;charge a debt which mu&s;t be paid either to-day or to-morrow, heaven knows!&mdash;Dear Lady Mary, you could lend me a &s;mall &s;um, could you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who? I! <STAGE>with &s;urpri&s;e</STAGE>&mdash;My dear creature, it was the very thing I was going to a&s;k of you: for when you have money, I know no one &s;o willing to di&s;per&s;e it among her friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am not I?&mdash;I prote&s;t I love to part with my money; for I know with what plea&s;ure I receive it my&s;elf, and I like to &s;ee that joy &s;parkle in another's eye, which has &s;o often brightened my own. But la&s;t night ruined me&mdash;I mu&s;t have mo|ney &s;omewhere&mdash;As you can't a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I mu&s;t a&s;k Mr. Norberry for his carriage, and immediately go in &s;earch of &s;ome friend that can lend me four, or five, or &s;ix, or &s;even hundred pounds. But the wor&s;t is, I have lo&s;t my credit&mdash;Is not that dread|ful?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I know what it is. <STAGE>Shaking her head.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't <HI>you</HI> marry? For you have as many to throw.</P>

<P>Mr. Mandred <STAGE><HI>pointing to Sir</HI> William</STAGE> a&s;ked me for it to take him into the city.</P>

<P>Oh, Mr. Mandred will give it up to Mi&s;s Dorrillon, I am &s;ure: he can defer his bu&s;ine&s;s till to-morrow.</P>

<P>I have money to pay, and I can't do it.</P>

<P>If one is going to receive, and the other to pay money, I think the be&s;t way is for you to go together; and then, what deficiency there is on one &s;ide, the other may &s;upply.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are the per&s;ons who know be&s;t how to be on them: for my part, had I not &s;ome|times felt what it was to want a friend, I might never have had humanity to be the friend of another.</P>

<P>Oh! If he was not rich, there would be no bearing him&mdash;Indeed he &s;eems to have lo&s;t all his friends; for during the month he has been here, I never found he had any one acquaintance out of this hou&s;e.</P>
