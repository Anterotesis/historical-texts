<P>THE BABLER. CONTAINING A CAREFUL SELECTION FROM THOSE ENTERTAINING and INTERESTING ESSAYS. WHICH HAVE GIVEN the PUBLIC &s;o much SATISFACTION under that TITLE DURING A COURSE of FOUR YEARS, IN OWEN's WEEKLY CHRONICLE.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no &s;ubject in the world upon which an author &s;peaks with a greater degree of latent pride, or a deeper air of outward humility, than his own productions.&mdash;He is perfectly &s;en&s;ible that they are trifles &mdash; yet he is bold enough to publi&s;h them &mdash;and while he &s;eems to relinqui&s;h every title to the favourable opinion of the world, he returns his warme&s;t thanks for pa&s;t obligations, and indirectly tells us he has obtained it&mdash;thus the public are reduced to the agreeable alternative, either of acknowledging his merit, or reflecting upon their own judgment&mdash;and the con&s;equence generally is, that through a fear of di&s;paraging the credit of our ta&s;te, or per&s;picuity, we exalt him at once into a writer of con&s;ummate mode&s;ty, and uncommon abilities.</P>
<P>THE author of the BABLER, however, wi&s;hes to &s;teer between the extremes of an o&s;tentatious parade, and an affected diffidence; he would by no means pre&s;umptuou&s;ly place his pieces upon a forum with the e&s;&s;ays of &s;ome cotemporaries, nor would he meanly &s;ink them to the level of others &mdash;a fir&s;t-rate reputation is no le&s;s beyond his hopes, than his de&s;erts; yet if in the &s;cale of honourable compari&s;on, he ri&s;es with no capital degree of me|rit,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
he is &s;atisfied that he cannot be the lowe&s;t in the ballance of contempt.&mdash;This declaration he is the more emboldened to make, as during the cour&s;e of his publication, he con&s;tantly had the honour of being re-printed by the greate&s;t num|ber of his literary fellow labourers in the vineyard of the public, and have been often happy enough to go through half a dozen editions, in half the number of days.</P>
<P>IN the concluding number of the&s;e volumes the author has made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the nature of e&s;&s;ay writing in general, and rendered it incon|te&s;tibly evident, that there is no walk of genius, which lies under &s;o many difficulties; yet of all the various e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts the news-paper drudge, is the mo&s;t unfortunately circum&s;tanced; &s;mall as the boundaries of a SPECTATOR, a RAMBLER, a WORLD, an ADVENTURER, or a CONNOISSEUR, may &s;eem, the news-paper writer is under a nece&s;&s;i|ty of moving in a &s;till more contracted circle&mdash;the Printer (who on the&s;e occa&s;ions is a very great man) does not &s;o much con&s;ider the importance of a writer's &s;ubject, as the immediate profit of the partners; it is not the improvement of the reader which he con&s;ults, but the intere&s;t of the paper, or the topic of the day, and therefore often &s;tints the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t in room, to adverti&s;e a parcel of &s;tolen goods, or to epitomize the trial of &s;ome remark|able murderer.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">I REMEMBER when the BABLER was fir&s;t un|dertaken, I &s;ent an e&s;&s;ay to the pre&s;s, on which I had employed extraordinary pains; and which I warmly imagined would have procured me at lea&s;t a fortnight's reputation &mdash; the &s;ubject of the e&s;&s;ay, was the ab&s;urdity of party di&s;tinctions; but unhap|pily, though I had endeavoured to contract my&s;elf within the mo&s;t moderate limits, I had &s;till ex|ceeded the prudential bounds of the Printer; &mdash; he accordingly brought me back the manu&s;cript, and declared it could not po&s;&s;ibly be in&s;erted without undergoing &s;ome con&s;iderable amputa|tions &mdash; It was in vain I argued with him on the importance of the &s;ubject, the &s;pirit of the writing, and the credit it would certainly do his paper &mdash; the rogue was incorregibly dull; and told me if I would have it in, I mu&s;t &s;trike a pen through the <HI>King,</HI> cut out lord <HI>Bute,</HI> and burn the people of <HI>England</HI> &mdash; The&s;e conditions were too hard to be complied with &mdash; and I rather cho&s;e to leave my admirable e&s;&s;ay out entirely, than man|gle it to the ta&s;te of an unfeeling blockhead, who appeared &s;o glaringly callous to the beauties of a ma&s;terly production.</P>
<P>CIRCUMSCRIBED thus unhappily in my limits, the reader of judgment will not be &s;urpri&s;ed at finding, many &s;ubjects thrown frequently into little hi&s;tories, which otherwi&s;e &s;ituated, I &s;hould have attempted to di&s;cu&s;s, on the methodical principles of a regular argument &mdash; As I had not room to en|ter into elaborate di&s;qui&s;itions, it was my bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
to give the reader a little entertainment; and my duty at lea&s;t to amu&s;e his fancy, &s;ince I was un|able to improve his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE principal matter which the author thinks him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of apologizing for, is the &s;imiliarity which the reader will find in &s;ome of the &s;ubjects; this was a circum&s;tance which, though the author was well aware, it would ex|po&s;e him to the cen&s;ure of the judicious, he could not conveniently avoid; as it was impo&s;&s;ible to deliver him&s;elf fully on &s;ome points in a &s;ingle paper, he was under a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;uming &s;uch as were mo&s;t material to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; he flatters him&s;elf however, that he will not be thought ex|tremely reprehen&s;ible on this account, &s;ince tho&s;e who are &s;atisfied with the mere &s;uperficials of a &s;ubject, may ea&s;ily e&s;cape the repetitions, while tho&s;e who expect any information by proceeding, may as ea&s;ily pardon the prolixity. Upon the whole, there is nothing in the volumes now offered to the public, for which the author could not urge &s;ome palliation; but his excu&s;es, perhaps, by tre&s;|pa&s;ing on the readers patience, at a time they can|not correct the minute&s;t error in his performance, will them&s;elves &s;tand in need of an apology; he will therefore only add, that tenderne&s;s in criti|ci&s;m is the next virtue to genero&s;ity; and that he &s;hall &s;carcely feel a greater &s;hare of gratitude for tho&s;e, who kindly di&s;cover any little merit in the following E&s;&s;ays; than for tho&s;e who benevolently overlook their numerous imperfections.</P>

<HEAD>THE BABLER.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>NUMB. I. <HI>Saturday, February</HI> 12.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is &s;carcely a little E&s;&s;ayi&s;t now-a-days, who amu&s;es the world under any particular title, but gives him&s;elf airs of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence, and claims &s;ome degree of affinity with the TATLER and SPECTATOR: in|deed, where the itch of reading is nearly equal to the <HI>cacoethes &s;cribendi,</HI> a man has no great occa&s;ion to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of either much genius or education to become a literary legi&s;lator, and &s;et him&s;elf up as a regulator of the public; the mo&s;t material article of all is, the choice of a tolerable title to attract the attention of the reader, and if this can be happily &s;truck out, learning and abilities are not &s;o much as &s;econdary con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="15">IN modern literature, a motto is a matter of no little con&s;equence, and an author, in the pre&s;ent anno domini, can no more pretend to circulate his writings without a motto, than without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the daily and evening papers: ma|ny an indu&s;trious pedlar, in the &s;mall wares of letters, has got off an edition of his pamphlet without any other recommendation than the name and the motto, and alarmed the world with a very terrible title page, when the contents were as innocent as water gruel, and in&s;ipid as a cold veal without either lemon or &s;alt.</P>
<P>IN this univer&s;al pur&s;uit after titles, I do not e&s;teem my&s;elf very unhapy in the choice of the BABLER; it is a character under which the ge|nerality of mankind are more or le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, and which is indi&s;criminately applicable to all orders and &s;ituations; different people only differ in the manner, but they are always &s;ure of agree|ing in e&s;&s;entials; and the humble mechanic, who harangues for the good of his country ever a &s;oli|tary pint of porter, is in fact no more a <HI>Babler</HI> than a per&s;onage of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, who talks about the national importance with all the u&s;ual ea&s;e and in&s;ipidity of di&s;tinction and importance. &mdash; In reality, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind is <HI>babling</HI>; for, if we place the principal happine&s;s of &s;ociety in conver&s;ation, a very little regard to any com|pany we may happen to &s;it with, will convince us that the generality of our acquaintance are nothing more than <HI>Bablers</HI>; &s;o very limited is the number
<PB N="3" REF="16">
which di&s;cour&s;es now-a-days with any inclination to improve or entertain, that, I dare &s;ay, my rea|ders will be &s;urprized when I &s;et down &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent names in the kingdom among the order of <HI>Bablers.</HI></P>
<P>THE word <HI>Babler</HI> being principally confined to verbal indi&s;cretion and impertinence, I &s;hall em|ploy the remaining part of this E&s;&s;ay in giving my readers &s;uch particular de&s;cription of the <HI>Babler,</HI> that they can never be at a lo&s;s in the application of the term when they meet with any of my re|lations.</P>
<P>WHENEVER a per&s;on &s;eems extremely earne&s;t to engro&s;s the conver&s;ation of the company, there can be no manner of doubt that he is a <HI>Babler.</HI></P>
<P>WHENEVER a per&s;on is uncommonly liberal in the payment of unnece&s;&s;ary compliments, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive degree of good-nature cannot avoid &s;et|ting him down a <HI>Babler.</HI></P>
<P>WHENEVER a man is fond of remembering te|dious and unentertaining &s;tories, and is apt to be put in mind of &s;uch and &s;uch a particular anecdote, by &s;ome corre&s;ponding circum&s;tance which may ca&s;ually ari&s;e in conver&s;ation, that man is, by every manner of means, a <HI>Babler.</HI></P>
<P>WHENEVER we &s;ee a man making an unnece&s;|&s;ary parade of his education, and interlarding his di&s;cour&s;e with technical terms, or &s;entences not clearly under&s;tood, in the language of Dogberry, "&s;et him down a &mdash; <HI>Babler."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="17">WHENEVER we find a man fond of repeating his own jokes, and de&s;irous of telling the <HI>good thing</HI> he &s;aid to his friend Jack &s;uch a-one, at &s;uch a time &mdash; down with him &mdash; a <HI>Babler.</HI></P>
<P>WHENEVER we &s;ee any per&s;on ready to circulate the laugh at the expence of decency and good manners, there is no occa&s;ion to he&s;itate in pro|nouncing him a <HI>Babler.</HI></P>
<P>WHENEVER we meet with a man di&s;po&s;ed to contradict, for no other rea&s;on but to &s;hew the &s;u|periority of his own abilities &mdash; O! a <HI>Babler,</HI> a <HI>Babler.</HI> And,</P>
<P>WHEN we hear him di&s;pute upon a &s;ubject he is totally unacquainted with, who can deny but he is a mo&s;t con&s;ummate <HI>Babler.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus given the out-lines of a <HI>Babler,</HI> any per&s;on with a very indifferent pencil may work up a &s;triking likene&s;s of the greate&s;t number of his acquaintance: for my own part, like the re&s;t of my brethren, I &s;hall &s;peak of men and things as I find my&s;elf prompted by humour or inclination; the only re&s;triction I &s;hall lay my&s;elf under, is ever to have decency and candour in view, and never entirely to lo&s;e &s;ight of my little judgment and under&s;tanding.&mdash;Upon the&s;e principles I hope to entertain the public; and, &s;hould I fail in the attempt, I mu&s;t condole my&s;elf with a line of my friend Horace,</P>

<P>IN the variety of cour&s;es which the generality of mankind pur&s;ue for the attainment of happine&s;s, it is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that they &s;hould be &s;hamefully inattentive in one of the mo&s;t material points that can po&s;&s;ibly in&s;ure it. &mdash; The point I mean is, that union of the &s;exes, which, proper|ly concluded, is the foundation of felicity to indi|viduals, and of &s;ecurity to the public. &mdash; Nature has given every parent a power of directing the in|clinations of their children, but allows of no un|rea&s;onable authority to force them; and &s;uch as have a &s;en&s;ible concern for the happine&s;s of their offspring, &s;hould be particularly careful that a re|ciprocal pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the parties before they con&s;ented to an inviolable union. &mdash; The ill-directed tenderne&s;s of parental affection, has often been productive of the mo&s;t unhappy con&s;equences: and many a father has made his children mi&s;erable for life, by a mi&s;taken &s;olicitude for their welfare, and by making a provi&s;ion for their happine&s;s which was not in the lea&s;t e&s;&s;ential, and for which they had not, in all probability, any manner of occa&s;ion. &mdash; I am led naturally to this &s;ubject by a paper now lying before me, the contents of which are here pre&s;ented to the reader:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<Q><L>The wretch who is &s;entenc'd to die,</L>
<L>May e&s;cape, and leave Ju&s;tice behind;</L>
<L>From his country perhaps, he may fly,</L>
<L>But O! &mdash; Can he fly from his mind?</L></Q>
<P>I AM the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men; and, notwith|&s;tanding it might be more prudent to conceal the cau&s;e of my affliction, I find an inclination to di&s;clo&s;e it in this public manner, too &s;trongly to be re&s;i&s;ted. &mdash; I am a young fellow of five and twenty, Sir, neither deformed in my per&s;on, nor, I hope, unhappy in my temper; my fortune is ea&s;y, my education liberal, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, I am as well calculated to pa&s;s in a croud as the generality of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>ABOUT twelve months ago, Sir, I fell pa&s;&s;io|nately in love with a young lady, who&s;e beauty and merit entitled her to a rank much more exalted than what I could rai&s;e her to, though &s;he was much my inferior in point of fortune. &mdash; She was at that time courted by a young gentleman in the law, and matters had actually gone &s;o far, that a day was appointed for the &s;olemnization of the nup|tials. &mdash; All this I was very well informed of, yet impetuou&s;ly hurried by the violence of my pa&s;sion, I di&s;clo&s;ed it to the father. &mdash; He was a man of the world; &mdash; my circum&s;tances were much better than his intended &s;on-in-law's, and he paid a le&s;s attention to the happine&s;s, than he &s;hewed for the
<PB N="7" REF="20">
advancement of his daughter. &mdash; Why &s;hould I take up your time, Mr. BABLER? Maria's match with her former lover was immediately broke off, and the unhappy young lady, who never pre&s;umed to di&s;obey her father's commands, was torn from the man of her heart, and married to one &s;he could never love.</P>
<P>I WAS in hope, Mr. BABLER, that a little time, and a tender behaviour on my &s;ide, as a man ne|ver loved more fondly than my&s;elf, would have utterly era&s;ed Mr. Bridgegrove from the bo&s;om of my wife, and placed me in his &s;tead. &mdash; But had I not been be&s;otted with my love, I might have ea&s;ily known, that a laudable impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of a &s;en&s;ible woman is never to be eradicat|ed: &mdash; No, Mr. BABLER, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible. &mdash; When a young raw girl, indeed, entertains &s;omething like a regard for a man, without know|ing the rea&s;on of her e&s;teem, it is nothing but a &s;truggle of de&s;ire, or, more properly &s;peaking, the wheyine&s;s of inclination, which, in a little time, &s;he laughs at her&s;elf, and, as &s;he grows in under|&s;tanding, ea&s;ily &s;kims off. &mdash; But, where a woman of &s;en&s;e has placed her affections on a man of me|rit, the pa&s;&s;ion is never to be era&s;ed; the more &s;he ponders on his worth, the more rea&s;on &s;he has to love him, and &s;he can never cea&s;e to think of his perfections, till &s;he is wholly dive&s;ted of thought.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY for me, Mr. BABLER, this was the ca&s;e. Mr. Bridgegrove po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole heart of Maria, and, in reality, de&s;erved it: he is,
<PB N="8" REF="21">
perhaps, the mo&s;t amiable of men, and, poor fellow, loves her to di&s;traction. I have been now married, Mr. BABLER, ten months, and have, I flatter my&s;elf, expre&s;&s;ed every act of tenderne&s;s proper for the lover or the hu&s;band, but to no pur|po&s;e. My wife behaves with the utmo&s;t complai|&s;ance, is uncommonly &s;olicitous to plea&s;e, but this conduct is the effect of her good &s;en&s;e, and not the con&s;equence of her love. The little endearing in|tercour&s;es between hu&s;band and wife, are <HI>&s;uffered,</HI> not <HI>enjoyed</HI>; if I complain of her coldne&s;s, &s;he a&s;&s;umes an air more gay, and affects to be plea&s;ed, though I &s;ee the &s;tarting tear ju&s;t bur&s;ting from her eye, and know the grief that rankles at her heart. Nay, the more I care&s;s the more mi&s;erable &s;he is made; and I &s;ee her generou&s;ly lamenting that &s;he cannot place her heart upon the man that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her hand, and is not utterly unworthy of her e&s;teem. O! Mr. BABLER, he mu&s;t have no deli|cay, no feeling, that can bear a circum&s;tance like this unmoved. How am I frequently torn to mad|ne&s;s with reflection, even when I have her fa&s;tened to my bo&s;om, to think her whole &s;oul is at that very moment running on another man. In her &s;leep &s;he frequently throws one of her fine arms round my neck, and pronounces the name of Bridgegrove in a manner that di&s;tracts me. Our little boy (for &s;he is lately brought to-bed) in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing is another &s;ource of anxiety to us both. I over-heard her ye&s;terday morning, weep|ing over the child, and crying, "My &s;weet boy,
<PB N="9" REF="22">
poor Bridgegrove &s;hould have been your father." O! Mr. BABLER, can any &s;ituation be &s;o afflict|ing as mine: &mdash; I have made the mo&s;t amiable of women for ever wretched, and torn a worthy young fellow from the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart. I have brought all my &s;orrows on my&s;elf, with the di&s;tre&s;sful con&s;ideration of having no right to com|plain. I de&s;erve, to be mi&s;erable. The man who would meanly hope to be happy in marriage, by &s;acrificing the inclination of the woman he loves, and ungenerou&s;ly lo&s;es every regard to her wi&s;hes, while he endeavours to gratify his own, has no preten&s;ion to felicity. Had I never obtained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Maria, I &s;hould not have been half &s;o wretched as I am now: time, and another object would, perhaps, have enabled me to bear her lo&s;s: &mdash; but now, ma&s;ter of her per&s;on, to find another in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, and to know that there is one whom &s;he holds con&s;iderably dearer than my|&s;elf, are con&s;iderations ab&s;olutely in&s;upportable. I cannot dwell any longer on the &s;ubject: I &s;hall therefore conclude with an advice to my own &s;ex, never to marry a woman who&s;e heart they know is engaged, nor to take a pitiful advantage of a fa|ther's authority, in oppo&s;ition to her inclination. If &s;he be a good woman, &s;he can never forget her fir&s;t choice, and it &s;he be bad, will inevitably bring &s;hame and &s;candal on the &s;econd.</P>

<P>WHEN I fir&s;t commenced Periodical E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, my fears pre&s;ented a thou&s;and difficulties to my imagination, in the proce&s;s of my de&s;ign. &mdash; I dreamed of ince&s;&s;ant application to pen and ink, and of continual vi&s;its from tho&s;e very worthy gentlemen, who are honoured with the appellation of <HI>Devils to the Pre&s;s</HI>: but my apprehen&s;ions were entirely groundle&s;s. &mdash; I no &s;ooner appeared in print than a whole army of good-natured per|&s;ons in&s;tantly drew up in my favour, among&s;t the re&s;t the wife of a city man of fa&s;hion, who writes to me after the following manner:</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>To the <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a haberda&s;her's wife, not very far from Cornhill, and though I never received any other education than what the Engli&s;h language could afford me, or made a greater progre&s;s in my &s;tudies than the Rule of Three Direct; yet I can &s;pell tolerably enough, and, though I &s;ay it, <HI>know a &s;heep's head from a carrot</HI> as well as Hodge in the new opera. &mdash; But, Sir, to the bu&s;ine&s;s of my letter.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band and I, Sir, are a young couple ju&s;t &s;et up in bu&s;ine&s;s, and, you know Mr. BABLER, as &s;uch, ought to be extremely complai&s;ant and re&s;pct|ful to our cu&s;tomers. &mdash; In the way of trade, every
<PB N="11" REF="24">
body who lays out a penny with us is to be con&s;i|dered as our &s;uperiors, at lea&s;t while they &s;tay in our &s;hop:&mdash;but my hu&s;band, who, it &s;eems, is wi&s;er than I am, is quite of a contrary opinion. &mdash; He never keeps his hat off a moment in the hou&s;e &mdash; and behaves to every one as if he rather laid them under an obligation by the &s;ale of his own commo|dities. &mdash; If a lady &s;teps in to buy a piece of ribband, or a hat, in&s;tead of &s;hewing her a variety of things, that may fix her attention, or induce her to make an additional purcha&s;e, he talks to her about plays, and about operas: in&s;tead of &s;aying, "The&s;e, Madam, are the be&s;t pair of gloves in the kingdom," he cries out, "To be &s;ure Mr. Garrick is the greate&s;t actor in the world;" or, "To be &s;ure Mi&s;s Brent is the fine&s;t &s;inger in the univer&s;e." &mdash; There is no bearing of him, Mr. BABLER: &mdash; the fellow will prate a whole hour about Shake&s;pear, when he ought to be number|ing up his threads; and run him&s;elf out of breath in encomiums on Otway, when he ought to be bu&s;y in the prai&s;e of his handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e are trifles, Mr. BABLER, when com|pared to &s;ome other in&s;tances of his behaviour: &mdash; why, Sir, he would not ri&s;e from dinner to &s;erve the Lady Mayore&s;s. &mdash; At dinner time, if he is told any per&s;on wants him about bu&s;ine&s;s. &mdash; "D&mdash;n it, do they think he'll get up from his dinner? Can they find no other time to come but when he is ju&s;t &s;at down at table? Let them wait or call again, which ever they think proper." &mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="25">
Ah, Mr. BABLER, people that are in trade &s;hould get up from breakfa&s;t, dinner, and &s;upper, to attend the nece&s;&s;ary duties of their profe&s;&s;ion. &mdash; Tho&s;e, who have no other dependence, &s;hould think them&s;elves happy in being called to their bu&s;ine&s;s at dinner time, &s;ince it is by that means they are enabled to have any dinner at all. &mdash; No later than Wedne&s;day la&s;t, Sir, this attention to his &s;tomach lo&s;t him a country order for a hundred pounds; and even the deputy of our ward was kept waiting ye&s;terday above ten minutes in the &s;hop, though he came to di&s;charge a little account which was due for his wi&s;e and two daughters.</P>
<P>AS I am re&s;olved, now I have begun, Mr. BABLER, to let you know all his faults, I mu&s;t inform you he has lately bought a hor&s;e, and paid thirty guineas for this hopeful bargain: &mdash; this hor&s;e he is to ride out every Sunday if the wea|ther be fine, and he happens to have no engage|ment. &mdash;'Tis odds, Mr. BABLER, that he does not find a ride convenient once a month &mdash; or that &s;omething does not prevent his excur&s;ion even at the end of that period: &mdash; but, however, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the weather and accidental engage|ments will permit him to go out one Sunday in four, the &s;tabling and provinder for his hor&s;e will at lea&s;t amount to &s;even &s;hillings a week: &mdash; &s;o, that every time he takes a ride out, hor&s;e hire will co&s;t him eight and twenty &s;hillings, (not to &s;ay any thing of the original purcha&s;e;) and for half the money be might get a hackney coach for the
<PB N="13" REF="26">
whole day, to carry all his family. &mdash; And here I cannot help reflecting, Mr. BABLER, upon this injudicious practice of riding out even Sunday, which &s;eems &s;o much in fa&s;hion among the genera|lity of our polite citizens. &mdash; If a trade&s;man buys a hor&s;e, and does not ride out every Sunday, his purcha&s;e becomes u&s;ele&s;s, and his money thrown away: &mdash; if he does, he debars him&s;elf of every other enjoyment, and cuts him&s;elf off from the only opportunity he has of attending the public wor&s;hip of God. &mdash; He is lo&s;t to his family and friends one day in &s;even, and is an alien to his Creator, on the mo&s;t &s;acred of them all.</P>
<P>PRAY, Mr. BABLER, print this letter: &mdash; your writings are much read in our neighbourhood, and my hu&s;band him&s;elf conde&s;cends to &s;ay you are a very &s;en&s;ible &s;ort of a fellow. &mdash; If you &s;hould have any opportunity, I beg you would &s;peak &s;omething about the dre&s;s of trade&s;men, for I have &s;ome rea&s;on to think my hu&s;band has actually be &s;poke a laced hat, and given the taylor directi|ons to put vellum holes in his next &s;uit of cloaths. &mdash; Do oblige me, dear Mr. BABLER, and I &s;hall always acknowledge my&s;elf much.</P>

<P>OF all the enemies to &s;ociety, there is none which &s;hould be held in a greater abhorrence than a man of gallantry profe&s;&s;ed; and yet, in this fa&s;hionable age, it is a character which the generality of our young fellows, and but too ma|ny of our old ones, are uncommonly &s;olicitous to obtain. But the &s;tronge&s;t invectives again&s;t this infamous di&s;po&s;ition, may not, perhaps, be half &s;o &s;erviceable as a little &s;tory, which a very worthy gentleman of my acquaintance, favoured me with la&s;t night, for which rea&s;on I &s;hall lay a&s;ide declaration and proceed to my narrative.</P>
<P>NOT many weeks ago, at the fir&s;t reduction of our forces, among many other officers who were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, a young lieutenant, one Mr. Fran&s;ham, received his di&s;charge. As the income of this gentleman's commi&s;&s;ion, during his continuance in the army, could not &s;uffer him to lay by any migh|ty matters for an emergency, his half pay would have been but a &s;lender &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, had not an old &s;chool-fellow of his, one Mr. Harold, a coun|try gentleman, made him a cordial offer of his hou&s;e and table, till he &s;hould be fortunately pro|vided for in &s;ome reputable employ. Mr. Harold was the mo&s;t amiable of men; he had a hand&s;ome per&s;on, a fine under&s;tanding, an affluent fortune, and a benevolent heart: He had been but newly married to a young lady, of whom he was pa&s;&s;i|onately
<PB N="15" REF="28">
fond; and who, if wit and beauty were capable of con&s;tituting matrimonial felicity, could not fail of making him the mo&s;t happy of men.</P>
<P>MR. Fran&s;ham was one of tho&s;e people who pro|fe&s;&s;ed a Covent-Garden &s;ort of knowledge, and, like a maggot in a chee&s;e, knew no part of the world but the rotten: His conver&s;ation was lively, but not improving, and he carried the appearance of much under&s;tanding, though, in reality, he had but little &s;en&s;e: his company, however, was entertaining enough: he talked of the polite di|ver&s;ions; told a &s;tory tolerably well; and &s;ung with &s;ome voice, and much ta&s;te. As the fla&s;hine&s;s of his conver&s;ation carried the appearance of wit, Mrs. Harold was not a little plea&s;ed with her new vi&s;itant; and Mr. Fran&s;ham, from the fir&s;t mo|ment he came into the hou&s;e, had formed a de&s;ign of rendering him&s;elf as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible to her, and without either being confined by the rules of friend&s;hip, or the principles of gratitude, he thought he could not be in reality a fine gentle|man, without endeavouring to alienate her affec|tions from her hu&s;band. &mdash; To dwell upon the cir|cum&s;tances is unnece&s;&s;ary; he left no art une&s;&s;ay|ed to gain his point, and, in an evil hour, too fatally &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>POOR Mr. Harold, not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting the nature of their intimacy, was really plea&s;ed at the countenance &s;hewn to Mr. Fran&s;ham, by his wife: every mark of complacency &s;hewn to that gen|tleman, he looked upon as a particular in&s;tance
<PB N="16" REF="29">
of her affection for him&s;elf; &mdash; but one evening returning from a vi&s;it, which he had paid alone to a gentleman in his neighbourhood, con&s;iderably &s;ooner than he was expected, upon going up to Mrs. Harold's chamber, he found the door locked, and fancied he heard her voice, and Mr. Fran|&s;ham's, in a very familiar &s;ort of conver&s;ation. An in&s;tinctive kind of terror &s;truck in&s;tantly to his heart: &mdash; He knocked at the door, which not being immediately unlocked, he bur&s;t it open, and ju&s;t as he entered, &s;aw his perfidious friend e&s;cape out of the window into the garden. Fran|tic at this &s;ight, the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion pre|vented him from pur&s;uing the infamous villain, by whom he had been &s;o barbarou&s;ly wronged: He gazed in a violent &s;it of horror for &s;ome time upon his wife, who &s;at trembling on the bed-&s;ide; then running to a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, which were kept generally in the bed-chamber, he &s;napt one of them at Mrs. Harold, and ran immediately after to find the partner of her crime; but Mr. Fran&s;ham, knowing Mr. Harold's temper too well to &s;tay within his reach, made &s;uch good u&s;e of his time, that he was quite out of danger before the other began the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>HAPPILY for Mrs. Harold, the pi&s;tol was not charged which was directed at her, though the fright threw her into a &s;woon: &mdash; but recovering, and finding her&s;elf entirely &s;afe, &s;he thought it mo&s;t prudent to retire to a friend's hou&s;e for a little time, till a reconciliation could be effected
<PB N="17" REF="30">
with her hu&s;band: Here &s;he remained for about a month, and tried every means of obtaining his forgivne&s;s, but to no purpo&s;e; and the following letter, which he wrote to her in his cooler mo|ments, put a total &s;top to any future attempts of that nature.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>BY what name &s;hall I di&s;tingui&s;h you?&mdash;or how &s;hall I be able to write to a woman with any degree of temper, whom I am born ever|la&s;tingly to cur&s;e and dete&s;t.&mdash;Can you, Maria; be mean enough to think of living with a man whom you have covered with di&s;grace, or bear the eternal memento which his pre&s;ence mu&s;t give you of your own,&mdash;that I did love,&mdash;but wherefore do I dwell upon a circum&s;tance which I mu&s;t endeavour to obliterate for ever, or men|tion the &s;incerity of my pa&s;&s;ion, when I think upon the reward it has met.</P>
<P>IF I expect to be forgiven my&s;elf in the next world, Maria, you conjure me to pardon your offences in this.&mdash;What a wretch mu&s;t the man be who excu&s;es a crime which the eye of all acquitting mercy cannot look upon without horror.&mdash;If there are particular crimes, which we are taught to believe heaven it&s;elf will not pardon, can we &s;uppo&s;e that there are not in|juries which it is impo&s;&s;ible for human nature ever to over-look?&mdash;Forgive you, Maria!&mdash;oh that I could.&mdash;My angui&s;h would not be of that poignant nature which it is, could the ba&s;ene&s;s of your conduct ever be forgot.&mdash;See me!&mdash;no.

<P>IT was a common expre&s;&s;ion of the late Boling|broke's, that if he was but an hour in the com|pany of a &s;tranger, and heard him &s;peak but fifty words, he could tell the particular turn or bias of his temper. &mdash; When I con&s;ider the general pro|pen&s;ry of mankind to enhance the idea of their own characters, and reflect that there is a particu|lar &s;omething in the opinion of every man which gives him an advantage over the re&s;t of the world, I am inclined to belive that his lord&s;hip's declara|tion is not altogether &s;o extraordinary as a per&s;on at fir&s;t might po&s;&s;ibly imagine it.</P>
<P>IN people of under&s;tanding the particular qua|lity upon which they principally value them&s;elves, is rather ea&s;ier to be di&s;covered than in tho&s;e of

ordinary capacities, becau&s;e conver&s;ation taking a more liberal turn, furni&s;hes a greater number of opportunities to draw it out. I was la&s;t night &s;it|ting with two or three friends, who are not a little e&s;teemed in the literary world, when I immedi|ately reflected upon lord Bolingbroke's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>&mdash;One of them opened the di&s;cour&s;e with a com|pliment to the abilities of Mr. Pope, and &s;eemed intent to make that celebrated author the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. Poetry he talked of as the fir&s;t of all the &s;ciences, and con&s;equently hinted, that &s;uch as excelled in this were &s;uperior to the mo&s;t eminent profe&s;&s;ors of any other. It is almo&s;t need|le&s;s to tell, that my friend has him&s;elf publi&s;hed &s;ome pieces in this way of writing, which are uni|ver&s;ally admired; and that while he was expatiat|ing on the merit of Mr. Pope, he had a &s;ecret intention of reminding us of his own character. &mdash; This gentleman, though a very &s;en&s;ible man, carries his zeal for the poetical mu&s;e a little too far: he looks upon every one with an eye of in|difference who has not received &s;ome marks of that lady's favour, and very lately refu&s;ed a woman of ten thou&s;and pounds who was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with him, for no other rea&s;on in life, than becau&s;e &s;he left the room, about &s;ome dome&s;tic occurrence, while he was reading an imitation of one of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">race's odes, which he had written, it &s;eems, that morning.</P>
<P>MY poetical friend entertained us for &s;ome time, when a mathematical acquaintance turned

the di&s;cour&s;e upon Sir I&s;aac Newton; in a little time my good friend Dr. Nettletop beat Sir I&s;aac out of the field with Boerhaave; Mr. Longwind, the hi&s;torian, however, quickly conquer'd Boer|haave with Rapin; and the wide field of hi&s;tory it&s;elf was not long after covered by Mr. Choleric, the politician, with the triumphs of his immortal King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>BUT if &s;o great a fondne&s;s of &s;hewing the par|ticular qualification wherein we excel, though it be a meritorious one, is de&s;erving of our cen&s;ure, how much more to be condemned are tho&s;e &s;ort of people, who build their reputation upon trifles of the mo&s;t ridiculous nature, and are con&s;tantly taking up the time of every company they are ad|mitted into with recitals of no con&s;equence to them&s;elves, and no entertainment to any body el&s;e. My cou&s;in <HI>Jack Babler</HI> gives me great offence this way: Jack particularly piques him&s;elf upon a very &s;mall &s;tomach, and an unconquerable aver|&s;ion to a buttock of beef. Hence, wherever he goes we are always &s;ure of a di&s;&s;ertation upon eat|ing; the &s;mallne&s;s of his appetite is a never-failing &s;ource of conver&s;ation; and I have known him to take up two hours and a half to convince a large company that he has not eat a pound of meat in a fortnight. If by a revolution in his habit of body my poor cou&s;in &s;hould unfortunately get a good &s;tomach, he mu&s;t re&s;ign all preten&s;ion to merit, and bani&s;h him&s;elf from &s;ociety for the want of common conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="35">BUT the mo&s;t extraordinary character I ever know that was not ab&s;olutely vicious, is my friend Sir Harry Whim&s;ey's:&mdash;Sir Harry has under&s;tand|ing, and yet he only u&s;es it to be a fool; he has a fortune capable of providing all the plea&s;ures of life, and yet he is never happy till he is com|pletely mi&s;erable.&mdash;Sir Harry, if he happens to be indi&s;po&s;ed, is a little ea&s;y in his mind, but if he be really ill, 'tis then he experiences the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction; his friends are all &s;ummoned, and with an air of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, told of his melancholy &s;ituation; how the pain in his head has torn him to pieces, and how he has not had a wink of &s;leep for three nights. When he finds any concern expre&s;&s;ed for his condition, his pride begins to &s;well, and the notion of his own import|ance encrea&s;es in proportion to the pity of his friends and the danger of his di&s;order.&mdash;He has been a man of very little merit however the&s;e three years, for, being naturally of a good con&s;titution, and not much addicted to intemperance of any nature, he has unhappily e&s;caped the &s;malle&s;t in|di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE knowledge of the&s;e foibles in other people is of no advantage to us, unle&s;s they teach us to correct whatever may be ami&s;s of the &s;ame nature in our&s;elves; the be&s;t of us have our little ab&s;ur|dities; for which rea&s;on when we laugh at the peculiarities of our acquaintance, we &s;hould by no means neglect an examination into our own.</P>

<P>AT a time when the whole Kingdom is run|ning mad with political di&s;qui&s;itions, it would be &s;omething hard if the BABLER was not allowed to dwell upon the &s;ubject; but as he is very unlike the generality of his name-&s;akes, and dreads no|thing &s;o much as offending, he declares him&s;elf publicly a lover of truth, yet an advocate of no party, and &s;ets up for the title of a good En|gli&s;hman without being either a Whig or a Tory. Party di&s;tinctions are to him, the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting circum&s;tances imaginable, and an intemperate zeal in the &s;upport of any faction, not only the mo&s;t ridiculous commotion in &s;ociety, but the mo&s;t dangerous.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED your la&s;t with much &s;atisfaction, though it contained &s;ome little acrimony on my conduct, and ea&s;ily di&s;covered the greatne&s;s of your e&s;teem, notwith&s;tanding it was blended &s;o frequently with reproof.</P>
<P>INDEED, my dear friend, whatever colour my change of principles may wear, or however it may be con&s;idered by the generality of people, I have done nothing which every other man in the world would not have done in my &s;ituation.&mdash;The very be&s;t of us are fond of greatne&s;s and power in our hearts; and however we may &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e either, the contempt never la&s;ts a moment longer than the incapacity to obtain them.&mdash;The friend|&s;hip of a King, the command of his revenues, an opportunity of promoting our friends and tri|umphing over our enemies, let me tell you, are con&s;iderations of no very trifling nature; and the man, in my opinion, mu&s;t be &s;omething more or le&s;s than human, wherever they are re&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;As I have not vanity &s;ufficient to pretend to the fir&s;t, I have &s;en&s;e enough to avoid the imputation of the latter; and am content with being nothing more than mortal, provided there are no malicious en|deavours to make me any thing le&s;s.</P>
<P>POPULARITY, my dear friend, is nothing more than a &s;tep-ladder for ambition to reach the &s;um|mit

of place and preferment. We all have our prices, and if it is a&s;ked why I continued &s;o long in an oppo&s;ition to the court, my an&s;wer is this, they did not come up to mine. There is &s;carcely a member, who&s;e price I do not know to a &s;ingle &s;ix-pence, and who&s;e very foul I could not almo&s;t purcha&s;e at the fir&s;t offer.&mdash;The rea&s;on former mi|ni&s;ters have been deceived in this matter is evident; they never con&s;idered the tempers of the people they had to deal with.

<P>THE people of England are, in general, a &s;et of hot-headed fools, a parcel of &s;en&s;ible coxcombs, who, though perfectly able to examine the bottom of things, never judge farther than the &s;urface.&mdash; They know their rights and privileges inviolably &s;afe, and yet they are never ea&s;y unle&s;s they think them in danger.&mdash;It is no way difficult therefore, for an a&s;piring commoner to take an advantage of this di&s;po&s;ition, and to convert their ignorant &s;oli|citude for the public emolument, entirely to the promotion of his own.&mdash;A &s;taunch oppo&s;ition on two or three que&s;tions, right or wrong, to the court, gets him a name; half a dozen impudent unmeaning &s;peeches, the admiration; and a trea|&s;onable pamphlet, the very &s;ouls of the people.&mdash;

His own intere&s;t then obliges him to join the mea&s;ures of the court. Upon this, the golden idol turns in&s;tantly to a calf, and leaves the field of preferment to &s;omebody el&s;e, who is next to &s;hare the admiration, and, in due time, the cur&s;es of the vulgar.&mdash;I remember I never thought my point completely carried, till they clapped me in the Tower.&mdash;I looked upon my&s;elf then as a made man, and the event fully ju&s;tified the warmth of my expectations. In reality I know no better friends to the con&s;titution of this country, was it any way in danger, than this &s;et of imaginary patriots:&mdash;they &s;truggle very heartily while they are at it, and the moment they are bought off, their preferment in&s;pires others with a view of following their example, in order by the &s;ame means to attain the &s;ame ends; and thus we always find a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of zealous pa|triots, who con&s;tantly advance the good of their country by being &s;o very &s;trenuous about their own. But to drop this &s;ubject, know, my dear friend, that the con&s;titution of this country is &s;o critically founded, that whatever effects the privi|leges of the people, will, in a little time, endanger the prerogative of the crown: there is no &s;epa|rate intere&s;t for either to con&s;ult; and in &s;uch a

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE remarks which were made upon the dre&s;s of trade&s;men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the younger fort, in your paper, from a corre&s;pondent, I can|not help admiring very much; and the more &s;o, as they come home to an in&s;tance in my own family, which has for a long time given me no little unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="43">You mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, that I am a plain pains taking man, and neither more or le&s;s than a buckle-maker, near Cornhill: I have kept &s;hop the&s;e twenty years, and brought up my family, con&s;i&s;ting of a wife, one &s;on, and a daughter, de|cently enough, though I &s;ay it my&s;elf; and, may be, have &s;aved a trifle or &s;o in my bu&s;ine&s;s; but that does not &s;ignify.</P>
<P>As every thing I have has been made by a clo&s;e application to trade, I do not chu&s;e appearing grander, Mr. Babler, than what becomes a per&s;on of my &s;tation; &s;o that I confine my&s;elf to a &s;uit or two of mode&s;t cloaths, and never put on my large&s;t wig or my be&s;t ruffled &s;hirt, but of a Sun|day.&mdash;My wife, however, who had been formerly a lady's maid in the city, has higher notions, and as I do not chu&s;e to quarrel with her, indulges her&s;elf in the gratification of them to as ridiculous a degree as my circum&s;tances can allow.&mdash;She would not come into the &s;hop for the world with|out a &s;ack or a French night cap, and is &s;ome|times &s;o loaded with powder and pomatum, that the very &s;mell is enough to take away the breath of my cu&s;tomers. I am never &s;uffered to walk with her of a <HI>working</HI> day, becau&s;e I am not &s;uffici|ently fine; nay, I am to e&s;teem it as no trifling favour, if I am permitted to accompany her to the White Conduit Hou&s;e or I&s;lington fields of a Sun|day. You may be &s;ure, Mr. Babler, that &s;o hope|ful an example has not e&s;caped my children with|out imitation. My daughter, who is about nine|teen,
<PB N="29" REF="44">
will put up with no le&s;s an appellation than <HI>a young lady,</HI> and my &s;on of cour&s;e thinks him&s;elf equally ju&s;tified in &s;upporting the title of <HI>a young gentleman</HI>; he quarrelled with my elde&s;t apprentice the other morning for calling him by the familiar name of <HI>Andrew,</HI> and my daughter in&s;i&s;ted upon turning away our la&s;t maid, becau&s;e, in &s;peaking of her to a third per&s;on, &s;he did not &s;ay <HI>Mi&s;s Dolly.</HI> My wife's fooli&s;h indulgence is a &s;till greater means of &s;poiling them.&mdash;My daughter is always dre&s;&s;ed out in a manner that renders her above do|ing any nece&s;&s;ary article in the oeconomy of a hou&s;e, and &s;uperior to the conde&s;cen&s;ion of &s;erving in the &s;hop.&mdash;If a cu&s;tomer comes in, in&s;tead of a&s;king what he wants, &s;he orders the boy to call <HI>his ma&s;ter,</HI> for &s;he woud not &s;toop to &s;end for <HI>her father</HI> to haggle about a twelve-penny knife, or a two-&s;hilling pair of buckles.&mdash;If &s;he &s;its behind the counter, it is with a look of dignity and im|portance; and, to every new comer in, puts on a new air, in order to enhance the idea of her con|&s;equence: my wife has lately bought her a pair, of &s;tone &s;hoe-buckles; and I am hourly teazed to death about purcha&s;ing her a metal watch. My &s;on, Mr. Babler, is not a whit le&s;s affected than my daughter. I cannot &s;ee in what re&s;pect he is any way my &s;uperior; and yet, through his mo|ther's means, he appears in a manner I never dur&s;t a&s;&s;ume without being laughed at by all my ac|quaintance. He has his ruffled &s;hirt on every day, his clean white &s;tockings; has actually got a &s;ilk
<PB N="30" REF="45">
wai&s;tcoat with vellum button-holes, and a gold|laced hat for Sundays. Is there any bearing this, Mr. Babler! But this is not the wor&s;t of it: As he improves in dre&s;s, the more he decrea&s;es in his manners; and the better he is &s;upplied with the articles of finery, the le&s;s re&s;pectful he grows to tho&s;e who provide him with the means. Lord, Sir! he con&s;iders me in no better light than a &s;ort of an upper &s;ervant, who is obliged to con&s;ult the gratification of his plea&s;ures, and to humour every turn and whim of his inclination. He &s;carce ever takes his hat off before me, and is &s;o far from thinking that there is any thing out of character in his dre&s;s, that he is always exclaiming again&s;t the poverty of mine. In this he is &s;upported both by his mother and his &s;i&s;ter, the former always de|claring, I &s;hame them with my na&s;ty way of ap|pearing, and my dutiful daughter wondering how her Papa can dre&s;s in &s;o &s;habby and pitiful a man|ner.&mdash;We are talked of all over the neighbour|hood, Mr. Babler, and I am for ever rated at the Blue Po&s;ts for &s;ubmitting to my wife's dominion in my family.&mdash;Print this, pray do, &s;hame may produce better effects than rea&s;on, and if it but makes my wife concerned at her behaviour, I &s;hall po&s;&s;ibly have every right to call my&s;elf,</P>

<P>I DO not know any thing in the pre&s;ent age which has done &s;uch e&s;&s;ential di&s;&s;ervice to the cau&s;e of virtue and morality as the ridiculous affectation of wit, which prevails in almo&s;t every order of the people. Under a preten&s;ion to this quality, the mo&s;t blameable levities become uni|ver&s;ally admired; and, what is much wor&s;e, the mo&s;t dangerous of all our vices are &s;et up as a &s;tandard for public imitation, to de&s;troy the tran|quility of a de&s;erving friend by &s;ome occa&s;ional &s;troke of impertinence, is, now-a-days, &s;ufficient foundation for the character of a wit, and we frequently reckon that per&s;on as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ex|traordinary abilities, who bids defiance to the mandates of his God.</P>
<P>THERE is one great unhappine&s;s attending this propen&s;ity to fa&s;hionable wit, which is, that men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e very often think them&s;elves ob|liged to give in to the general opinion of their acquaintance; and, in order to merit the e&s;teem of the world, &s;ubmit to the very errors which their own under&s;tanding mu&s;t naturally lead them to condemn.&mdash;Among the number of my own friends who are unhappily, victims to the world in this re&s;pect, I cannot, without the utmo&s;t concern, re|flect upon poor <HI>Ned Froilby.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Ned</HI> came from the Univer&s;ity, which was at the age of nineteen, he had a doating old
<PB N="37" REF="52">
grand-mother, who &s;upplied him plentifully with money, and by who&s;e fondne&s;s he was enabled to indulge all the luxurious depravities incident to his years: Upon his fir&s;t coming to town he was introduced, as a hopeful young fellow at a &s;ociety of wits, who frequented a fa&s;hionable coffee-hou&s;e in the neighbourhood of Covent garden. Unacquainted with the world, their manners were perfectly new to our young adventurer, and it was not without an infinite pain he heard ob&s;cenity and execration form the principle part of the fir&s;t night's di&s;cour&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding this, there was a &s;omething in the company which produced an involuntary attachment, and he was overheard whi&s;pering to the friend who introduced him, <Q>that it was a pity &s;uch and &s;uch gentlemen were not le&s;s immoral, for he looked upon them as exce&s;&s;ively agreeable.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is, in the human mind, a natural promp|titude of imitating manners wherever we happen to like a man. This was poor <HI>Ned</HI>'s ca&s;e; in le&s;s than a week an oath was not altogether &s;o &s;hock|ing, and it was rather too re&s;erved for a young fellow to bani&s;h an innocent freedom in talking of women that &s;uited with his years and con&s;titution. There is no nece&s;&s;ity for circum&s;tantial particu|larities; &s;uffice it, that <HI>Ned,</HI> before the month was over, grew pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the character of a <HI>wit,</HI> and &s;hewed, that in purcha&s;ing &s;o honourable an appellation, he was utterly regardle&s;s of the means.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="53">THE fir&s;t &s;troke of wit that procured him any reputation, was the overturning of his Grandmo|ther's coach, in a little excur&s;ion to Richmond, where he in&s;i&s;ted on mounting the coach-box, and commencing driver: Our Phaeton, unable to ma|nage the hor&s;es, drove again&s;t a mile-&s;tone, upon which the carriage in&s;tantly gave a violent jerk, and pitched him headlong into a cucumber bed on the road &s;ide, where he was mi&s;erably cut with the gla&s;&s;es: the good old lady had her arm broke by the accident, and what with the acutene&s;s of the pain, and her terrors for her <HI>Neddy,</HI> a fever en&s;ued, which carried her off in a fortnight. When he was able to come abroad, his next &s;ally of wit was upon an unfortunate waiter, who&s;e eye he knocked out with the head of a tobacco-pipe; this co&s;t him two hundred pounds to &s;uppre&s;s a pro&s;ecution, exclu&s;ive of a twenty pound annuity during the life of the &s;ufferer.&mdash;A duel with a Highland officer for &s;ome reflexions on brim&s;tone was his next exploit; after which he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively bred four riots at the playhou&s;e, and carried off &s;even milliners apprentices within the purlieus of Covent Garden. It is remarkable, that when our modern men of wit endeavour at a character, they generally employ them&s;elves in proving their &s;pirit, and the moment they arrive at the pitch of <HI>doing</HI> what they think proper, the itch of heroi&s;m naturally di&s;appears, and they content them&s;elves with <HI>&s;aying</HI> what they plea&s;e.&mdash;This is exactly <HI>Ned</HI>'s ca&s;e; finding the reputation of his courage
<PB N="39" REF="54">
&s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed, he re&s;ts &s;atisfied with di&s;|turbing every conver&s;ation he over hears, and has humility enough to be no more than very imper|tinent whenever he engages in an argument. At the playhou&s;e I have heard him affect a hor&s;e laugh in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;age of a tragedy; and at a concert I never knew him plea&s;ed with the performers till he had put them entirely out. Fatigued with this in&s;ipid round, his wit has taken a different turn; religion and it's members are now the objects of his ridicule, and po&s;&s;ibly from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in his life, having rea&s;on to fear that there is another world after this, he always endeavours to convince his acquaintance that there is not.&mdash; Unhappy <HI>Ned Frailby,</HI> &s;etting out a fa&s;hionable wit, he has &s;unk into a real infidel, and, to gain the admiration of a blockhead he &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e, has forfeited the favour of his God. The people who wi&s;h him be&s;t can only pity him; but where he is not per&s;onally known, he is looked upon as what he is; yet <HI>Ned</HI> has a thou&s;and good qualities; his ear is never turned from the complaint of &s;or|row, nor his bounty with-held from the tear of di&s;tre&s;s: he is the be&s;t of ma&s;ters, the kinde&s;t of landlords, and the warme&s;t of friends. He has a fine fancy, a &s;ound under&s;tanding, and a bene|volent heart; but a pa&s;&s;ion for admiration has un|done him, and he is an amiable reprobate at be&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a picture there needs no comment: let any man of wit clap his hand upon his heart, and examine if he has not all of <HI>Ned</HI>'s bad quali|tries;
<PB N="40" REF="55">
and then let him try how far they are exte|nuated by the good. If, upon examination, he &s;hould appear to have a great deal of the fir&s;t and very little of the latter, he is really a very wretched being, and we may very fairly cry out with the poet,</P>

<HEAD>ORIGINAL LETTER From Dean SWIFT to Mr. POPE. (Never before made public.)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> POPE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM wonderfully plea&s;ed with the publication of your Ethic Epi&s;tles, not only on account of their poetical and moral excellence, but on ac|count of that hearty aver&s;ion to Mini&s;ters and Courts, which breathes through &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;ages: Perhaps I am the more taken with your &s;entiments on this head, becau&s;e they are a &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="41" REF="56">
authority for &s;ome opinions advanced by my|&s;elf; and you know we are always certain of al|lowing other people's notions to be of weight and importance when they bear any conformity to our own.</P>
<P>I DO not know how it is, but I never liked a Mini&s;ter in all my day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Our friends <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> I had a &s;incere value for in their private &s;tations, but in their public capacities I looked up on them both (and you know I have &s;aid it to their faces) as little better than a couple of r &mdash; ls. This regard to their ab&s;tracted merit as indivi|duals, has frequently led me to &s;upport tenets dia|metrically oppo&s;ite to my principles; and I have often engaged as a champion for the conduct of the mini&s;ters, becau&s;e I had a cordial affection for the integrity of the men. There is &s;uch an hone&s;t openne&s;s in Harley, and &s;o apparent an ingenuou&s;|ne&s;s in St. John, that I am attached to their in|tere&s;t in &s;pite of my teeth, and left while I labour to re&s;cue them from the name of &s;coundrels in their offices, to &s;ink under the weight of the damn'd appellation my&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN fact, Pope, I believe it impo&s;&s;ible for any mini&s;ter to be an hone&s;t man. There are fifty thou&s;and trap doors, from the very nature of his office, in which it is next to impo&s;&s;ible but his in|tegrity mu&s;t tumble.&mdash;One right honourable r &mdash; l or other has eternally &s;ome &s;trumpet to provide for, or &s;ome cuckold to recommend, in preference to the claims of real worth, and the
<PB N="42" REF="57">
preten&s;ions of the truly de&s;erving; not to mention any thing of a mini&s;ter's own friends, his imple|ments and dependants, who all naturally expect to be provided for in cour&s;e. Thus &s;ituated, a man at the head of affairs is obliged very frequently to overlook the &s;olicitations of &s;ervices and merit, as I have this moment ob&s;erved, and expo&s;es him&s;elf to the re&s;entment of many di&s;appointed levee danglers, from an utter impo&s;&s;ibility to provide for all. Hence a number of enemies are certain of at|tacking him at every quarter, and, as the battery in &s;ome places may be ju&s;tly enough levelled, the report mu&s;t be heard without end.</P>
<P>BUT as wealth and power are always &s;ure of find|ing advocates, we never &s;ee a mini&s;ter without a number of literary mercenaries employed in his defence, to refute the arguments of malice, or to evade the accu&s;ations of truth; to knock on the head with the hammer of plump contradiction, or to puzzle by a fallacious repre&s;entation of facts. The&s;e worthy gentlemen, did they really con&s;ider the true intere&s;t of the mini&s;ter, would never en|deavour at any thing like a fair di&s;pute. A round lie ought to be given to every a&s;&s;ertion prejudicial to his reputation, and this would produce &s;uch a number of replies, that the public would &s;oon give up the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a point which &s;addled them with a heavy expence. A &s;warm of pamphlets the lower orders have not the ability to purcha&s;e, and the higher have not the lei&s;ure to read: Hence a debate that occa&s;ions a number of publications mu&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="58">
in&s;en&s;ibly die away, and the principal &s;ufferer be the unfortunate book&s;eller; for &s;eldom, very &s;el|dom, has the proprietory&s;hip of a &s;ix-penny touch, fallen to the &s;hare of <HI>any regularly bred</HI> author.</P>
<P>PEOPLE may talk what they will of the infring|ment which mini&s;terial artificers have made upon the liberty of the &s;ubject, but in my opinion the Stamp-Office is the mo&s;t dangerous; the duty laid there upon all publications, is a flagrant attack up|on the liberty of the pre&s;s, and by choaking up the only channel which the public have of &s;etting forth their grievances, cuts off the mo&s;t probable mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of having them redre&s;&s;ed; it is in fact <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;troke of mini&s;terial cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning which I can remember; for let a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">retary be never &s;o bad a man, one half of his villainy pa&s;&s;es the notice of the world, becau&s;e few people are willing to buy a knowledge of it at an exorbitant price.</P>
<P>THE general plea which is u&s;ed by mini&s;terial advocates, and a plea which I my&s;elf have u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s is, that an attack upon the mini&s;ter is an affront upon the crown; and that there is no accu&s;ation laid at the door of a &s;ecretary, that is not an indirect reflexion upon the king. This is a plea&s;ant way of rea&s;oning, to be &s;ure; for by the expre&s;s declaration of our laws, an Engli&s;h prince is a piece of royal infallibility, incapable of doing wrong: as this po&s;ition is univer&s;ally admitted, it mu&s;t con&s;equently follow, that let us &s;patter as we plea&s;e, not a bit of dirt can &s;tick upon the monarch; or even if it could, would the monarch
<PB N="44" REF="59">
be an hone&s;t or a &s;en&s;ible man, to be offended, if it was apparently evident he was in the wrong? Duty and Reverence is all &s;tuff, Pope; the Prince who is offended at cen&s;ure, ought never to furni&s;h a cau&s;e for it; and the King who would exact the obedience, ought to de&s;erve the affection of his people. This is the voice of rea&s;on, and the Prince who is above li&s;tening to it, may po&s;&s;ibly be feared; but I'll &s;take my &s;alvation that he never can be loved.</P>
<P>THE po&s;ition that a King can do no wrong, Pope, mu&s;t either tax the Engli&s;h nation with great inju&s;tice, or great incon&s;i&s;tency. If a King can do no wrong, why was King James the &s;econd, bani&s;hed? And if a king can do wrong, why the plague are we con&s;tantly affirming that he <HI>cannot.</HI> Either way we &s;tand &s;elf condemned: in the fir&s;t place, we mu&s;t be very wicked men, if the po&s;&s;ition holds, and very fool|i&s;h ones in the &s;econd, if it does not. But incon|&s;i&s;tency is our prevailing characteri&s;tic; and if we are not &s;et down as a nation of &s;coundrels, we mu&s;t think our&s;elves pretty ea&s;y under the appella|tion of fools.</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM going to advance a po&s;ition which the whole world has been intimate with, &s;ince it's fir&s;t creation; yet, what is not a little odd, a po|&s;ition that one half of our modern authors think as nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s, three or four times a week, as if we were under the greate&s;t doubt of it's truth, or utterly unacquainted with its rectitude. This Po&s;ition, Sir, is neither more nor le&s;s than the im|perfection of all human enjoyments, and the ju&s;t di&s;regard which &s;hould be &s;hewn to every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this life, by &s;uch as have a proper &s;olicitude for the happine&s;s of the next.</P>
<P>I AM an old fellow, ma&s;ter Babler, very near &s;ixty-five; and when I look back upon the various occurrences of my life, and recollect the objects, which principally attracted my attention, from the cradle to the pre&s;ent hour, I cannot help crying out with the poet,</P>
<Q><PB N="46" REF="61">
<L>A phantom of plea&s;ure, like happine&s;s dre&s;t,</L>
<L>From the cradle we're taught to pur&s;ue;</L>
<L>Yet our hope is but vanity, take it at be&s;t,</L>
<L>And our wi&s;dom but vanity too.</L></Q>
<P>WHEN I was about ten years of age, Sir, the <HI>Summum bonum</HI> of all worldly felicity was a holiday from &s;chool, and a pennyworth of marbles.&mdash;How have I envyed a chimney-&s;weeper's apprentice ba&s;king in the &s;un, in all the amplitude of idlene&s;s and rags, when I con&s;idered him as unre&s;trained by the tyranny of &s;ome &s;urly pedagogue, or enabled to cry <HI>"fair up"</HI> at a game of <HI>&s;lap.</HI>&mdash;As I grew up, Sir, my attention was imperceptibly engaged to amu&s;ements, rather more manly, but, however, le&s;s innocent. Many a good time have I been diverted by fa&s;tening a rope acro&s;s our &s;treet in a dark night, to tumble un&s;u&s;pecting pa&s;&s;engers in the dirt; and many a cat have I tied to the knocker of a &s;treet door, to throw the fir&s;t &s;ervant wench into fits, by whom it might be occa&s;ionally opened&mdash;the more mi&s;chief on the&s;e pretty little frolicks, the better the amu&s;ement; and I remem|ber, never to have received &s;o much real &s;atisfac|tion, as being the cau&s;e in one night of an old woman's eye &s;cratched half out, and a man's break|ing his leg.</P>
<P>AT &s;eventeen, however, I began to look on amu&s;ements of this nature with an eye of di&s;gu&s;t; my time was now wholly taken up with an at|tendance
<PB N="47" REF="62">
upon every little girl in our neighbour|hood; and between that age and twenty-five, I had the happine&s;s of ruining nineteen. You can by no means conceive the tran&s;ports I felt, Mr. Babler, to &s;urvey &s;o many victims to my per&s;onal merit and addre&s;s; often has my heart exulted at the tears of &s;ome poor deluded innocent, my &s;atis|faction being always good naturedly proportioned to the di&s;tre&s;s which I cau&s;ed; and once I looked upon my&s;elf as the happie&s;t of all human beings, three young ladies with whom I had been particu|lar, being fortunately di&s;carded on that account by their friends, and turned out of doors.</P>
<P>AT thirty, Sir, I was married to a woman who&s;e per&s;on was far from being agreeable, but who&s;e fortune had too many charms to be with|&s;tood. My ambition now was directed to the pur|cha&s;e of a fine &s;tud of cattle, and a magnificent country hou&s;e. My wi&s;hes were gratified, but in le&s;s than three months I &s;old off the one, and &s;el|dom put my foot into the other, unle&s;s &s;ome very extraordinary circum&s;tance indeed, made my ap|pearance ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>THE mutability of my plea&s;ures &s;till continuing Sir, I was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fond of the reputation of a hard drinker, the character of a de&s;perate rider, the &s;ame of a good mark&s;man, the glory of a bil|liard player, and once was mi&s;erable a whole twelve-month, on account of lo&s;ing a rubber at Dutch Pins.&mdash;I have eat a raw beef &s;take out of pride, whi&s;tled for a wager with a very hone&s;t
<PB N="48" REF="63">
butcher in Newgate-market, and thought it a piece of heroi&s;m to be locked up all night with the re|mains of a murderer, di&s;&s;ected by the &s;urgeons. In &s;hort, Sir, there is &s;carcely a fa&s;hionable article of reputation that I have not acquired; but the hey day of the &s;pirits being long &s;ince over, and rea&s;on beginning to reflect upon pur&s;uits which nature is no longer able to continue, I look upon every former object of my admiration, with a real con|cern, and an in&s;uperable contempt:&mdash;and yet, Sir, at this age I have my enjoyments, which I cannot help pur&s;uing with an avidity truly ridiculous. I pique my&s;elf not a little on &s;moaking half a dozen pipes of an evening, and have lately contended for the honour of being the be&s;t politician at our club, in a long argument with Doctor Dozely the par|&s;on, about Magna Charta, and the natural rights of a free-born Engli&s;hman.&mdash;Yet, Sir, is all this blaze of reputation worth living for.&mdash;I blu&s;h to be diverted by &s;uch trifles, but can by no means throw them off.&mdash;I am, in &s;hort, a convincing proof, Sir, of Solomon's &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervation, "that all is vanity and vexation of &s;pirit," being perfectly &s;en&s;ible that no happine&s;s or enjoyment of this life, can be at all equal to con&s;cious &s;atisfaction, of pre|paring for the unutterable tran&s;ports of the next.</P>

<P>UNIVERSAL &s;oever as the &s;pirit of amour may be, and great &s;oever as the countenance may be which it receives from the polite world, there is no one &s;ource from which &s;uch a number of calamities are produced, nor any one &s;pring which pours in &s;uch a variety of misfortunes upon Society. Unhappily in this gay age the depravity of manners has ari&s;en to &s;o enormous a degree, that it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary for a young fellow to give into the fa&s;hionable follies, and practice vices to which he has a real abhorrence, if he would e&s;tabli&s;h the character of a man of ta&s;te, or &s;hew him&s;elf tolerably well acquainted with the world.</P>
<P>IN the pro&s;ecution of modern amour, more than in any other vice, there are allurements which very few think them&s;elves capable of re&s;i&s;ting, or even chu&s;e to re&s;i&s;t, if they could. A man finds his vanity tickled, as well as his inclination gratified, in the &s;eduction of unwary innocence, and, ab|&s;tracted from the tran&s;port re&s;ulting from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, the generality of our &s;ex think, with an in|finity of &s;atisfaction, upon their own accompli&s;h|ments, and &s;uppo&s;e they mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome extraordinary qualifications when a woman &s;hews her &s;en&s;ibility of them at no le&s;s a price than her everla&s;ting di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="65">THE &s;ame vanity which impels the one &s;ex to a pur&s;uit of unwarrantable amour, is the very rea&s;on why the other is &s;o &s;eldom offended, when they even know that a man's de&s;ign is repugnant to ho|nour and virtue. The plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the adoration paid to a pretty face, ca&s;ts a veil over the infamous intention of him who offers it, and the generality of women are content to be addre&s;&s;ed upon the footing of &s;trumpets, provided the offence which is offered to the purity of their hearts, is mingled with a well-turn'd compliment to the beauty of their per&s;ons. Hence, actuated by va|nity, and perhaps rendered weak from con&s;titution, the amiable ideot of the &s;ofter &s;ex is immediately undone, and the remor&s;ele&s;s libertine of ours feels no compunction in the ruin of her character, &s;ince the mon&s;trous depravity of general opinion induces him to con&s;ider it as an enhancement of his own. Nay, this vanity on the &s;ide of the ladies has &s;ometimes been &s;o unaccountably ab&s;urb, that two &s;i&s;ters have quarrelled about the adre&s;&s;es of an agreeable &s;poiler, and contended, with an inflexi|ble &s;edulity, for the honour of &s;acrificing their peace of mind in this world, and endangering their everla&s;ting happine&s;s in the next.</P>
<P>INDEPENDANT of the lamentable con&s;equences in point of character, which on the woman's part mo&s;t commonly attend a deviation from virtue, the effects which &s;uch a deviation has upon her &s;pi|rits, is generally fatal. There is a &s;oftne&s;s in the female mind, &s;o very &s;u&s;ceptible of tender impre&s;|&s;ions,

which I pre&s;ume will be no way di&s;agreeable to &s;uch as remember the <HI>Political Dictionary,</HI> as there was &s;carcely a periodical production in the Briti&s;h dominions which did not immediately take it in.</P>
<P><HI>Religion.</HI>] A ridiculous compo&s;ition of unfa|&s;hionable ordinances, in&s;tituted with no other de|&s;ign than to check every laudable impul&s;e of vice and immorality, and calculated for no other pur|po&s;e than to de&s;troy the very e&s;&s;ence of a fine gen|tleman.</P>

<P><HI>Gratitude.</HI>] A narrow-minded de&s;picable re|membrance of benefits received, and a &s;candalous de&s;ire of embracing every opportunity to return them.</P>
<P><HI>Honcur.</HI>] An idle regard to the dictates of friend|&s;hip and benevolence, and a paltry adherence to the minute&s;t law of order and morality.</P>
<P><HI>Hone&s;ty.</HI>] A fooli&s;h regard to the &s;anctity of our words upon every occa&s;ion, and a &s;ervile abhor|rence to the &s;malle&s;t tre&s;pa&s;s upon the property of our neighbours.</P>
<P><HI>Courage.</HI>] A low-minded aver&s;ion of brutality to &s;uch as, from &s;ituation in life, mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to re&s;ent a hor&s;e whipping, or complain at the lo&s;s

<P><HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law.</HI>] An exertion of that natural right which every man has to a Hare or a Patridge belonging to his own grounds, and which de&s;troy both his corn and gra&s;s by the authority of parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Liberty and property.</HI>] An indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of keeping game for other people to kill, with pains and penalties of the mo&s;t arbitrary kind, if we think of appropriating the minute&s;t article to the u&s;e of our own families.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="72"><HI>A free-born Engli&s;hman.</HI>] One who is continually bragging of liberty, and independance, when he has neither will nor property of his own, and laughs at the wretchedne&s;s of other countries, while he him&s;elf is indulged with no other privi|lege than the right of nominating the per&s;on by whom he choo&s;es to be en&s;laved.</P>
<P><HI>Magna charta.</HI>] An idle word made u&s;e of by the Populace, &s;ignifying a natural right of being go|verned by laws which they con&s;tantly &s;uffer to be trampled on, and an inherent claim to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e privileges, which they have neither &s;en&s;e or &s;pirit enough to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>A &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</HI>] A great officer in whom crimes are no crimes, and who, by a political &s;pecies of infallibility, can exerci&s;e acts of op|pre&s;&s;ion, without ever dreading the rod of cor|rection, or regarding the poignancy of general re|proof.</P>
<P><HI>The people of Ireland.</HI>] A noble and &s;pirited na|tion, inviolably attached to us by every tie of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, and who, on every occa&s;ion, hazard both their lives and fortunes in our de|fence; yet to whom we con&s;tantly make &s;uch ju&s;t and grateful returns, as to omit no opportunity (however illegal and arbitrary) of beggaring them, though the ruin of their intere&s;t lays a manife&s;t foundation for the de&s;truction of our own.</P>
<P><HI>The lords of the ocean.</HI>] The &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited people of Great Britain, who have a naval force con&s;iderably &s;uperior to all the other &s;tates of

Europe put together, yet &s;ervilely do homage to a ne&s;t of little African pirates on the coa&s;t of Bar|bary, and pay a yearly tribute to a &s;et of robbers, whom they ought to root out from the face of the earth.</P>
<P><HI>An independent freeholder and lover of his country.</HI>] One who, on every election for a member of par|liament, &s;acrifices his con&s;cience to his conve|nience, &s;ets up his dear country, and his darling freedom to the be&s;t bidder, yet impudently finds fault with his repre&s;entative for following &s;o lau|dable an example, nor &s;uffers any body to be a &s;croundrel, without reproach, but him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>A peerage.</HI>] In former days an honour conferred upon &s;uch as had rendered them&s;elves con&s;picuous for their merit, and eminent for their virtues; but in the more modern ages it has been, in general, the wages of venality and corruption, and a di&s;tinc|tion not to be purcha&s;ed at a &s;maller price than everla&s;ting infamy and di&s;grace.</P>
<P><HI>A regard for the royal prerogative.</HI>] A worn out pretence to infringe upon the laws, and a glaring de&s;ign upon the privileges of the people.</P>
<P><HI>National egoti&s;m or ga&s;conade.</HI>] An unpardonable cu&s;tom among the French of extolling their own merit to the &s;kies, but never practi&s;ed among the mode&s;t natives of this kingdom, though our pre&s;&s;es are every moment teeming <HI>with &s;ons of liberty, roa&s;t-beef and pudding, noble-minded Britons, and free-born Engli&s;hmen.</HI></P>

<P>I AM never more diverted than when I &s;ee your grave important &s;et of gentlemen who would pa&s;s upon the world as men of extraordinary &s;aga|city, running into a number of little petulancies, which they imagine them&s;elves to be con&s;iderably above, and fretting at the verie&s;t trifles we can think of, when they affect a &s;uperiority of re&s;olu|tion, which the mo&s;t &s;triking calamities of life are not &s;ufficiently powerful to di&s;turb.</P>
<P>THIS &s;pecies of philo&s;ophers is generally com|po&s;ed of men who have much pride, or little un|der&s;tanding, and who, through a contemptible &s;ort of vanity, make them&s;elves not a little le&s;s than human, that they may have an opportunity of ap|pearing in the eyes of the injudicious to be in|finitely more. Of this ca&s;t was the elder Brutus, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence of death upon his own &s;ons, without the &s;hadow of a pang, yet, at another time, knocked one of his &s;ervants down for putting a grain of &s;alt too much in his broth.</P>
<P>BUT without going &s;o very far back for in&s;tances of this extraordinary cla&s;s of mankind, my old friend Frank Surly is one of the mo&s;t remarkable, which it has ever produced.&mdash;Frank and I were bred together at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and before he was twelve years of age, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from
<PB N="61" REF="76">
every other boy in the &s;chool by the uncommon moro&s;ene&s;s of his temper, and his contempt of tho&s;e puni&s;hments which the generality of his age and &s;tanding, always held in the greate&s;t dread. &mdash; There were few lads in the whole &s;chool &s;uperior to Frank either in application or abilities, yet I have known him frequently inattentive and care|le&s;s about his le&s;&s;ons, that we might &s;ee with how much fortitude he could bear to be flogged.&mdash;Nay, if any of his intimates had been guilty of any rogui&s;h prank which de&s;erved the di&s;cipline of the rod, he would often de&s;ire them to lay the blame on him, and &s;uffer, with all the compu&s;ure in the world, a hearty flagellation in their &s;tead. &mdash; Un|happily however, upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, when Frank was going to be puni&s;hed for &s;ome petty crime, which he begged might be laid to his charge, the lad who was really guilty of the fact, &s;truck with his behaviour, went up to the ma&s;ter, and without di&s;gui&s;e, related the affair, acknow|ledged the fault, and declared he would rather be cut to pieces than &s;ee another &s;uffer for an action which he had committed him&s;elf. &mdash; The lad's ge|nero&s;ity had an effect upon the ma&s;ter, nor was he without &s;ome &s;urprize at the behaviour of Frank.&mdash;He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them both to their &s;eats, and, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible concern of the latter, never flogged him after. &mdash; Frank finding he could have no opportunity of &s;hewing his &s;toici&s;m any longer, through downright pride, paid an application to his
<PB N="62" REF="77">
&s;tudies, that in a little time made him the be&s;t &s;cholar in the whole &s;chool, and re&s;olving to be re|markable for the extremities of his behaviour, the moment the ma&s;ter had declared he would never gratify him with another whipping, he grew re|markably well behaved, and piqued him&s;elf upon keeping up a con&s;equence and dignity in his actions, to prove that the fear of puni&s;hment had nothing to do in the reformation of his manners.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition which di&s;tingui&s;hed Frank in his earlier years, has all along rendered him con&s;picuous &s;ince his reach to maturity. &mdash; As he and I &s;till hold up an intimacy, whenever I go down into Oxford&s;hire, I pa&s;s a week at his hou&s;e. &mdash; The la&s;t time I was there, he was laid up with a very violent fit of the gout, and whenever the pain was at an extremity, he would conver&s;e with unu&s;ual chearfulne&s;s, or divert him&s;elf with one of the &s;ongs which was in vogue when he and I were younkers. &mdash; If any body pitied him, he in&s;tantly flew into a pa&s;&s;ion; but if you &s;eemed to make &s;light of bodily angui&s;h and infirmity, he &s;hook you by the hand, and told you, you were a man of un|der&s;tanding. &mdash; About ten years ago, my old friend married a mo&s;t valuable woman, of whom he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond, and who returned his affection almo&s;t to madne&s;s. &mdash; As their circum&s;tances were affluent, this reciprocal regard, one would imagine, &s;hould have produced their mutual felicity: &mdash; But far on the contrary, &mdash; Frank was too proud to be happy, and as his love for Mrs. Surly was univer|&s;ally
<PB N="62" REF="78">
known to be exce&s;&s;ive, he was never &s;atisfied, unle&s;s he treated her as the object of his hate. &mdash; He only lived in her looks, and yet he has torn him&s;elf from her pre&s;ence for three whole weeks, and &s;o unaccountably headlong was he hurried by this ridiculous &s;toici&s;m, that, upon her death, which happened in childbed, though his &s;oul was tortured with all the angui&s;h of con&s;ummate pity and di&s;tracted love, he went to the a&s;&s;embly an hour after her decea&s;e, and &s;at up &mdash; (a tear now and then &s;traying down his cheek) &mdash; along with Colonel Tierce, Major Piquet, and Sir Oliver Ombre, at a party of whi&s;t.</P>
<P>A PERSON &s;o apparently &s;teeled again&s;t the cala|mities of life, we &s;hould rea&s;onably expect, would hold the little impertinencies or interruptions of it in the greate&s;t contempt: but this is far from be|ing the ca&s;e with my friend Frank. &mdash; A plait more or le&s;s in his &s;hirt &s;leeve will &s;et him raving for an hour, and I remember that he &s;hot a favourite Dog one day, in the &s;table-yard, for leaping accidentally up and dirtying the &s;kirt of his coat. &mdash; It is im|po&s;&s;ible to enumerate the various incon&s;i&s;tencies of my poor friend's character. &mdash; I once knew him &s;et up a carele&s;s drunken fellow of a coachman, who overturned him in a ditch, in a very hand|&s;ome inn, three weeks after; and at another time di&s;charge his footman at a moment's warning, for wearing too little powder in his wig.</P>

with any degree of circum&s;pection, we &s;hould find the principal number approach &s;o very near the &s;tandard of Frank Surly, that the account given of him will &s;erve as no improper de&s;cription of them all. &mdash; The ridiculous light in which one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible is &s;et, will, I hope, &s;erve for as good an admonition as I can po&s;&s;ibly give to this tribe of very important beings; and I &s;hall think my&s;elf particularly happy if the foregoing picture is at|tended with any &s;alutary effect.</P>

<P>I did my&s;elf the plea&s;ure a few evenings ago to call at the hou&s;e of an old friend, with whom I have been intimate the&s;e thirty years, and for whom I have infinitely more than a common re&s;pect. An affair of arbitration had, however, called him abroad, and I found no-body at home but Mi&s;s Maria his younger daughter, who is now the mo&s;t lively picture of innocence and beauty which I ever &s;aw, and clo&s;ely bordering upon twenty-one. As I always avoid &s;tiffning my conver&s;ation with the &s;tarch of antiquity, and con&s;tantly endeavour at appearing more ready to be in&s;tructed than to in|&s;truct, the young people are very fond of admitting me into their company; and there is &s;carcely a day that I have not an invitation or two from &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;prightly tea-tables in town, which is
<PB N="65" REF="80">
more, I fancy, than can be &s;aid by any other old fellow of &s;ixty within the weekly bills.</P>
<P>ON my enquiring for her papa, Mi&s;s Maria &s;tepped out of the parlour, and &s;eizing one of my hands, cried, "O Mr. Babler, is it you? I in&s;i&s;t upon your coming in." Few intreaties are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make a man do what he likes. I imme|diately a&s;&s;ented, &s;at down, and pa&s;&s;ed two of the mo&s;t agreeable hours I ever experienced in my whole life.</P>
<P>OUR conver&s;ation, after turning upon a variety of topics, at la&s;t fell upon that divine part of our church-wor&s;hip, in which the congregation &s;ing prai&s;es to the mo&s;t high. If it is proper, &s;ays Maria, for a per&s;on of my years to &s;peak of &s;o im|portant a &s;ubject as religion, and not too pre&s;ump|tuous for the petticoats to comment upon the wor|&s;hip of the church, I &s;hould think, Mr. Babler, that this part of our liturgy might be very much improved. Great complaints have been often made, that &s;o &s;mall a number of the congregation join in the &s;inging of p&s;alms, and though I admit the neglect is highly unpardonable, and the cen|&s;ure extremely ju&s;t, yet reformation would, in my opinion, be infinitely &s;uperior to reprehen&s;ion, and I think every room for complaint might be remov|ed by a proper &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE end of poetry and mu&s;ic, if I am right in my information, is to actuate upon the pa&s;&s;ions, and, in all religious compo&s;ition, to rai&s;e the mind to an elevated de&s;ire of acknowledging the won|derful
<PB N="66" REF="81">
mercy and goodne&s;s of the divine Being. How far the hymns u&s;ed in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church for this purpo&s;e are from an&s;wering &s;o &s;alutary an end, it is no le&s;s painful than unnece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve: in the ver&s;ification of the very be&s;t p&s;alms all the rapture of the original text is lo&s;t, and in that the mu&s;ic &s;hould be no way &s;uperior to the poetry; there is hardly any one tune which can create the lea&s;t emotion but &s;leep. In fact, Sir, the mo&s;t triffling compo&s;itions, which are form'd for the bu&s;ine&s;s of amu&s;ement, have twenty times more merit than tho&s;e &s;et apart for the &s;ervice of religion, and infinitely greater pains are taken in the writing or &s;etting of a Ranelagh ballad, than in a hymn to the honour of the living God.</P>
<P>FROM what I have &s;aid, Mr. Babler, I would by no means infer, that either the poetical or mu&s;i|cal part of our hymns &s;hould be light, trifling or airy; but &s;urely, Sir, the &s;pirit of devotion would breathe con&s;iderably &s;tronger in the&s;e pieces, and have a much greater effect, if an author of repu|tation &s;hould give us a fine ver&s;ification of the p&s;alms, and a ma&s;ter of eminence &s;hould receive proper encouragement to &s;ee them exqui&s;itely &s;et. We have a number of tunes plaintive, &s;olemn and enchanting to a miracle, which are neverthele&s;s as familiar as they are charming, and calculated to bewitch the carele&s;s and inattentive to a &s;en&s;e, to a pa&s;&s;ion for that duty which they now treat with a lifele&s;s indifference, or an in&s;upportable neglect. Religion, Sir, by this means, would become fa|&s;hionable,
<PB N="67" REF="82">
and it would be deemed no longer in|elegant for a fine lady or a fine gentleman to join in the prai&s;es of their God.</P>
<P>LORD, Mr. Babler, how can you have patience to hear me chatter &s;o much, but I &s;hall not tre&s;|pa&s;s on your patience much longer. Mr. Well|worth (who you know vi&s;its us every day) and I were talking on this very &s;ubject a few evenings ago, and as he has a really &s;weet ta&s;te for poetry, I took the liberty of reque&s;ting he would write me a hymn, whether penitential or thank&s;giving, I left to him&s;elf. He called on me this morning and brought it in his hand. I think it mighty pretty, and &s;hall be very happy, if my opinion &s;hould re|ceive &s;uch a &s;anction as yours, Mr. Babler. Mr. Wellworth read it to me with great &s;en&s;ibility, and I own I thought he never looked &s;o well in all his life.</P>
<P>SOME how or other my eye encountered with Mi&s;s Maria's at the end of this &s;peech; &s;he &s;eemed con&s;cious, and on my ob&s;erving that Mr. Wellworth was an excellent young man, &s;he reddened exce&s;|&s;ively, and &s;eemed at a &s;tand for words. As I would not confu&s;e her by any means, I &s;hifted the conver&s;ation; but &s;he re&s;umed it immediately, and &s;aid, well, Mr. Babler, you mu&s;t give me your &s;entiments on this little production, here it is, con|tinued &s;he, taking it out of her pocket-book,&mdash;and here; no not here, but in the next number I &s;hall pre&s;ent it with &s;omething el&s;e of con&s;equence, which it occa&s;ioned to my readers.</P>

<P>WHEN I had done reading, Mi&s;s Maria de|manded my opinion of this performance, which I could not but prai&s;e very much. &mdash; I told her how|ever, that the thought of concluding every &s;tanza with the name of the Deity, was borrowed from Eve's hymn, in the death of Abel, though I could not think of making any compari&s;on, pretty as that hymn was, with this of Mr. Wellworth's &mdash; The young lady &s;eemed va&s;tly delighted at my com|mendation,
<PB N="70" REF="85">
and was beginning to make a verbal acknowledgment of her &s;atisfaction, when her fa|ther's rap was heard at the door &mdash; My old friend entered the parlour with an air of mingled anger and dejection, and in&s;tead of taking any notice of me, began at once upon his daughter &mdash; <Q>So ma|dam, this is fine information I have received &mdash; What you are under an engagement to Mr. Wellworth are you? O! Maria, Maria!</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ecret was now out, and I found my &s;u&s;pi|cions of Mi&s;s Maria's attachment had con&s;iderably more than a tolerable ground. The poor girl &s;tood quite confounded, and &s;eemed utterly inca|pable of making a reply. As I &s;aw nothing cul|pable in her regard for a worthy young fellow, I took upon me to intercede in her behalf, and at la&s;t reduced her father to the temper I could wi&s;h. I found a di&s;parity of fortune was the only objec|tion which the old gentleman had to his daughter's choice; for though my friend has as benevolent a heart as any man alive, yet he has the caution of all old fellows, and keeps a &s;trict eye on the main chance. When I had brought him to &s;ome de|gree of good humour, I took an opportunity of turning the conver&s;ation, and read him the fore|going hymn. He was charmed with it, and a&s;ked me if I knew the author. "Yes, &s;ays I, Mr. Wellworth." <Q>Fore God, (returned he) though I do not approve of his connection with my daughter, I am mightily taken with his works.</Q> This was all I wanted, <Q>and pray my good Sir,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I find it &s;o very cu&s;tomary for people of all denominations to give a &s;ketch of their lives and to publi&s;h any particular in&s;tances of folly, or extraordinary turns of fortune, to the world, I take the liberty of &s;ending you a portrait of my&s;elf, in which, ab&s;tracted from it's being a &s;triking likene&s;s,
<PB N="72" REF="87">
I &s;hall claim no merit, unle&s;s it be allowed a ge|neral one.</P>
<P>I AM the only &s;on of a trade&s;man, who died about five years ago, in the city, Mr. Babler, and left me in very hand&s;ome circum&s;tances. My father had a common-council &s;ort of pride about him, which a&s;pired at bringing up his &s;on a gen|tleman, and an ambition of making him carry an air of profu&s;ion, while the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy was ob&s;erved in his expence. I have been tricked out, Sir, in the very pink of city finery, a laced wai&s;tcoat and a bag wig, at a time that I was &s;carcely allowed a &s;ufficiency to pay my club at the Hor&s;e&s;hoe and Magpie, and talked about tavern bills and &s;upper, when half a guinea has been the extent of my finances for a whole week.</P>
<P>UPON the death of old Squaretoes, Mr. Babler, I found my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ten thou&s;and pounds, and &s;carcely got a wink of &s;leep, during a whole month, my imagination was &s;o perpetually haunted by the recollection of the &s;um. Habituated, how|ever, to the &s;ight of the money, I &s;oon began to entertain a notion of laying a few hundreds ele|gantly out. With this view a carriage was in|&s;tantly be&s;poke, an everla&s;ting leave taken of all the &s;treets between Temple-bar and White-chapel, and a hand&s;ome apartment furni&s;hed at the other end of the town. The three formidable letters of E, S, and Q. were quickly added to my name, and having a &s;trong inclinat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on to be thought, I fancied in reality that I was, a fine gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="88">THE fir&s;t &s;ix weeks after it came home, I &s;pent at lea&s;t fourteen hours a day in my coach. I ap|peared every where, &s;aw every thing, and upon ad|dre&s;&s;ing days frequently invited &s;ome of the alder|men to a di&s;h of chocolate. Indeed one accident happened at my fir&s;t going to court which made me not a little taken notice of; I never before had pre&s;umed to put on a &s;word, and being in the circle making my bow, it unfortunately got between my legs, and threw me on my face; in order to &s;ave my&s;elf from falling, I laid hold of an officer's &s;kirt, who was ju&s;t near me, and held it with &s;uch a force, that I dragged him with me down. The whole drawing room was in a roar; the ladies tit|tered, the men bur&s;t into a hor&s;e-laugh, and even the face of maje&s;ty it&s;elf relaxed into a &s;mile. As &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible I picked my&s;elf up, and retired; the officer did the &s;ame, and as I had been the cau&s;e of his di&s;grace, I made him a num|ber of apologies, and took him home to dine: be|fore we parted, a reciprocal e&s;teem was cordially expre&s;&s;ed, and my new acquaintance talking &s;ome|thing about a &s;carcity of money, he did me the favour to borrow fifty pieces, and gave me a po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance of coming to breakfa&s;t the next morn|ing.</P>
<P>HE was better than his word; he came and brought half a dozen brother officers in his hand. We dined at Almacks; drank Burgundy till we were blind; &mdash; &s;coured the &s;treets, and beat the watch. The frolick was new to me, Mr. Babler,
<PB N="74" REF="89">
I was charmed with it, and behaved &s;o well, that my companions honoured me with the name of a very hone&s;t fellow, and &s;wore it was a damn'd pity I was &s;o aukward with my &s;word.</P>
<P>THESE being the fir&s;t gentlemen I ever had ac|quaintance with, it is no wonder I treated them with extraordinary re&s;pect, bred up to an inter|cour&s;e with none but &s;ellers of linen, and dealers in packthread, I con&s;idered every man with a laced coat and cockade, as infinitely my &s;uperior, and endeavoured, with a &s;edulity of an uncommon nature, to imitate what I &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately admired. Happily my endeavours &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that in a little time I &s;wore, got drunk, broke windows, kicked waiters, and in&s;ulted mode&s;t women with as good a grace as if I had been colonel of a regi|ment.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements I wa&s;ted away above half my fortune in two or three years, with no other character than that of a very hone&s;t fel|low; when a &s;pirited rape on the daughter of my taylor, took away two thou&s;and pounds to hu&s;h a pro&s;ecution and make it up. The action increa&s;ed my reputation, but hurt my circum&s;tances much: I had not now as much more left in the world. &mdash; I was di&s;claimed by my relations, and de&s;pi&s;ed by my father's &s;ober friends. One half of my companions had died, and the other half were in danger of a jail. The &s;ame misfortune &s;tared me in the face; my debts were numerous, my creditors pre&s;&s;ing; di&s;charged they were obliged to be, and accord|ingly
<PB N="75" REF="90">
were, and when every thing was finally &s;et|tled, I found my&s;elf, in&s;tead of having increa&s;ed my ten thou&s;and, to have no more than &s;even hun|dred and fifty pounds left.&mdash;What was to be done? I could not bear the thoughts of going back into the city, and under&s;tood no bu&s;ine&s;s if I did. A lieutenancy offering, I purcha&s;ed it as the la&s;t re|&s;ource, and am now &s;tarving upon the half pay. A &s;triking example of ignorant pride and under|bred prodigality; at once the warning and con|tempt of our &s;hewy little citizens.</P>
<P>MY letter need neither comment nor applica|tion; what I &s;hall &s;ay may be contained in the but-end of the old &s;ong,

<P>UNFASHIONABLE &s;oever as it may be to enter upon religious &s;ubjects in &s;uch an age as the pre&s;ent, there are &s;ome who I flatter my&s;elf will neverthele&s;s pay a little attention to a topic of &s;uch importance without a blu&s;h, and think it no di&s;grace either to their gentility or their under&s;tanding, to employ a few moments in the con&s;ideration of &s;ome points, for which, at the
<PB N="76" REF="91">
awful period of their di&s;&s;olution, eternities upon eternities will hardly &s;eem too much.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the differences which daily &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the various modes or &s;y&s;tems of the chri&s;|tian religion, and think upon the inflexible par|tiality which every man entertains in favour of his own, we ought to be ab&s;olutely certain that the particular form which each of us glories to po&s;&s;e&s;s, is perfectly conformable to our notions of the Deity, and con&s;i&s;tent in the minute&s;t degree with tho&s;e divine le&s;&s;ons which were inculcated by the Saviour of the world, in his my&s;terious mi&s;&s;ion to man. &mdash; If we are not po&s;itive in this, let our belief be di&s;|tingui&s;hed by what name &s;oever we think proper, let us be prote&s;tants or papi&s;ts, quakers or pre&s;by|terians, I can take upon me to aver, that we have no right to the name of chri&s;tians, and may with equal propriety, take a le&s;&s;on from the ALCORAN as the GOSPEL.</P>
<P>IT is not the ceremony u&s;ed at bapti&s;m, the &s;prinkling of water, nor the promi&s;es of our pa|rents in the pre&s;ence of GOD, which con&s;titute the CHRISTIAN; no, it is an actual conformity to the precepts of our BLESSED LORD, and an undevi|ating obedience to the tenets which are laid down in the hi&s;tory of his life and miracles. &mdash; Nothing can be more ab&s;urd, nor in reality more criminal, than for a man to a&s;pire at the glorious title of a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> who is regardle&s;s of the duties which that appellation renders indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; or a &s;tranger to the obligations which are particularly
<PB N="77" REF="92">
enjoined by the name; it is at once a fatal decep|tion of his own mo&s;t important expectations, an in|&s;ult to his <HI>Saviour,</HI> and a defiance of his <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what propriety &s;hall I beg leave to a&s;k, can the various &s;ects of religion in this kingdom call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> when, in the unremitting hatred which they con&s;tantly entertain towards one another, they utterly de&s;troy that univer&s;al principle of <HI>Charity</HI> which ought to be the foun|dation, nay, the very e&s;&s;ence of their belief. &mdash; With what propriety can he, who is ble&s;t with un|bounded affluence, &s;tile him&s;elf a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> if his ear is turned away from the &s;ight of affliction, or his heart unaffected with the tear of di&s;tre&s;s. &mdash; <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> obliges him to a con&s;tant relief of the wretched; and without a behaviour entirely con|&s;onant to the duties of this belief, what po&s;&s;ible pretention can he have to a name that exalts him to a fellow&s;hip with angels, and lifts him above the &s;tars? &mdash; Will a con&s;tant attendance on the public place of his wor&s;hip, exculpate the oppre&s;&s;or of the widow and the fatherle&s;s, or give the name of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to the villain who infamou&s;ly lifts a dagger to the brea&s;t of his benefactor, or ba&s;ely &s;trives to murder the reputation of his friend? &mdash; Can the betrayer of un&s;u&s;pecting innocence think on the pangs of &s;ome violated virgin, left without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without comfort, without bread: expo&s;ed to all the upbraidings of a relentle&s;s world, to aggravate the &s;everity of her own reflexions, and po&s;&s;ibly plunged in the additional mi&s;ery of having a helple&s;s little
<PB N="78" REF="93">
innocent, and an unalterable affection for the mon|&s;ter by whom &s;he is &s;o cruelly undone? I &s;ay can the perpetrator of an act like this, &s;it down calmly, &s;atisfied with the rectitude of his behaviour, and think him&s;elf as a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;incerely acquitted to his <HI>God?</HI> Alas, if any man thus culpable can be &s;o pre&s;umptuou&s;ly daring as to think him&s;elf a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> it is doubtful whether he is mo&s;t a reprobate or an idiot, or whether he is mo&s;t regardle&s;s or ignorant of his crimes.</P>
<P>IN every profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> faith there is a number of good natured people who are always unea&s;y about the fate of the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and ter|ribly afflicted le&s;t the ignorant &s;avages of <HI>America</HI> &s;hould not, at the la&s;t day, be received into the favour of the <HI>Supreme Being.</HI> &mdash; The&s;e people en|tertain &s;trange notions of the <HI>Deity,</HI> if they can &s;uppo&s;e that a power <HI>all-wi&s;e, all-merciful,</HI> and <HI>all-ju&s;t,</HI> will require, at the hands of &s;uch ignorant nations, a knowledge which he has not thought proper to be&s;tow: a &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a nature is highly derogatory to the divine e&s;&s;ence; it is a tacit implication that the <HI>great father</HI> of the univer&s;e exerci&s;es a &s;everity, which would be cruel in his creatures but to think of; and a palpable in&s;inu|ation, that the <HI>Being of beings,</HI> is capable of a ty|ranny which would utterly degrade the meane&s;t, in the human race, among the wonders of his hand. &mdash; No, from &s;uch only, as have received much, much is expected; and perhaps at the la&s;t day, myriads of our <HI>nominal</HI> chri&s;tians, who look
<PB N="79" REF="94">
upon the <HI>American Savage</HI> with pity or contempt, would give a hecatomb of worlds, had they power to change &s;ituations, to &s;ee &s;o little to an&s;wer for, as him: conformable to what he knows, he in|variably regulates the tenor of his conduct, main|tains an unalterable reverence for &s;ome great ob|ject which he looks upon as his God, and pays an implicit obedience to his laws; whatever his &s;y&s;tem of belief may be, he endeavours to do it all the honour in his power, and &s;hudders at nothing &s;o much as the thought of bringing it into di&s;grace. &mdash; Who among&s;t us can hone&s;tly &s;ay the &s;ame? Enlightened with the lamp of &s;cience and the &s;un of true religion, <HI>our</HI> actions are a perpetual &s;tigma on our belief; we acknowledge the wonderful merceies of a <HI>Suffering Redeemer,</HI> yet are continually uttering bla&s;phemies again&s;t his name; we own the infinite merits of his go&s;pel, and yet act in ma|nife&s;t contradiction to every precept it contains; the Deity, we are &s;en&s;ible can think us into a&s;hes for the enormity of our crimes, and yet we con|tinue to behave in open di&s;obedience to his will; in &s;hort, both hoping and fearing the exi&s;tence of another world, we &s;acrifice every valuable oppor|tunity in this, and con&s;tantly boa&s;ting the advan|tages accruing from our religion, we are always acting as if we had no religion at all. &mdash; Let us, therefore, in&s;tead of condemning the errors of our neighbours, begin with correcting whatever is ami&s;s in our&s;elves; and in&s;tead of finding fault with the religion of other people, be &s;atisfied that <HI>real</HI>

<P>AMONG a variety of virgins who langui&s;hed for Ora&s;min, Almira, a dam&s;el of Bal&s;ora, newly ar|rived at Bagdad, was the only per&s;on ble&s;t with a reciprocal e&s;teem; the blu&s;h of the morning was le&s;s ro&s;y than her cheek, and the diamond of gol|conda not &s;o brilliant as her eye; her bo&s;om was as white as the &s;wan upon the waters, and gentle as the mid&s;ummer murmur of the &s;tream. &mdash; How oft O ye groves of Bal&s;ora, have ye echoed with the &s;ame of her beauty! how oft, O ye vallies of Bag|dad, have ye re&s;ounded with her prai&s;e. You know that her voice would chain the tyger of the de&s;art, and unnerve the wild &s;tag as he darted from the hill; you know that the &s;pices of Ormus could not equal her in breath, nor the daughters of paradi&s;e excel her in dignity and grace.</P>
<P>ORASMIN and Almira were not more di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for their merit, than remarkable for their loves; and as neither had any parent living to oppo&s;e their wi&s;hes, a day was appointed for the celebration of their nuptials, to the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction of their friends.&mdash;Ora&s;min, all impatient for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the only object that had ever engro&s;&s;ed his heart, long|ed for the happy hour with the utmo&s;t anxiety, and fea&s;ted his imagination continually with the
<PB N="82" REF="97">
raptures he was to experience in the arms of Almira. She not le&s;s impatient, though more confined in her expre&s;&s;ions of the approaching felicity, painted equally warm to her fancy, the uninterrupted enjoyment of all &s;he held dear, and counted over the weeks, the months, and the years, &s;he had a probable expectation of pa&s;&s;ing in the tendere&s;t intercour&s;e with her adored Ora&s;min. &mdash; But alas! while our lovers were thus enhancing the pre&s;ent, by reflecting on the future, an order arrived for Almira to attend the Caliph, who had for &s;ome time been entertained with various reports of her unparallelled beauty, and wanted to &s;ee if the encomiums lavi&s;hed &s;o frequently upon her, Were ju&s;t. Neither her religion nor her allegiance could allow her to form any excu&s;e for not attending the <HI>commander of the faithful,</HI> much le&s;s admit of a re&s;olution to di&s;obey; he was wor&s;hipped with an implicit reverence, as a &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the holy Ma|homet, by all his people, and his word was ever looked upon as the irrevocable voice of Fate. Al|mira therefore was immediately carried with a bleeding heart to the palace, and the moment &s;he was beheld by the Caliph, declared the mo&s;t fa|vourite of his queens.</P>
<P>IT is not in language to tell the di&s;traction of the two lovers, at being thus unexpectedly torn for ever from each others arms; the moment Ora&s;min heard that his Almira had captivated the Caliph, he looked upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of life to be entirely over, and unable to &s;upport the inexpre&s;&s;ible agonies
<PB N="83" REF="98">
of his own mind, con&s;idered the angel of death as the only mini&s;ter of repo&s;e: for two whole days and nights he wandered through the various rooms of his hou&s;e in an ab&s;olute &s;tate of phrenzy, calling out at every interval in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate tone, on the name of his ravi&s;hed Almira. On the third day, growing &s;omewhat calmer, he began to reflect on all the circum&s;tances of his pa&s;t life, in order to find out in what particular he had given Mahomet &s;uch unpardonable offence, as to meet with &s;o &s;evere a cha&s;ti&s;ement at his hands. After revolving a long time, and finding nothing but &s;ome youthful indi&s;cretions to an&s;wer for, which were infinitely overballanced by a number of meritorious actions, he in&s;en&s;ibly dropt upon one knee, and began to expo&s;tulate, in the following manner, with his God:</P>
<P><Q>THOU great creator of the univer&s;e, who &s;its't enthroned above the &s;even heavens, where even the conception of no prophet but the holy ma|homet, can dare to &s;oar: look down in mercy on a wretch, who numbers him&s;elf with the mo&s;t unhappy of human beings, though he has con&s;tantly maintained the deepe&s;t reverence for thy laws; tell him, O thou infinitely high! in|form him, O thou inexpre&s;&s;ibly ju&s;t! why he, who has ever made it his unalterable &s;tudy, to de&s;erve thy awful &s;anction on his deeds, is deem|ed to &s;uffer what the mo&s;t impious prophaner of thy divine will, would look upon as a &s;everity,
<PB N="84" REF="99">
and confidently exclaim, was too great a puni&s;h|ment for the mo&s;t enormous of his crimes.</Q></P>
<P>ORASMIN had &s;carcely ended, when a clap of thunder &s;hook the hou&s;e, and an unu&s;ual bright|ne&s;s lightened the room, where he &s;till continued on his knee, a&s;toni&s;hed at this apparent me&s;&s;age from the Deity. &mdash; When he recovered him&s;elf a lit|tle, a voice as awful as the trumpet of heaven, de|&s;ired him carefully to attend, and thus went on. &mdash; <Q>Cea&s;e, O mi&s;taken man, to doubt the mercy and ju&s;tice of the Supreme Being, who though he acts by unknown &s;prings and &s;eeming &s;everities, is ever watchful for the happine&s;s of the virtuous, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent in all his laws. &mdash; Con|&s;ider, Ora&s;min, that this world is a tran&s;itory bubble, which mu&s;t &s;hortly bur&s;t upon the ocean of time; that it is at be&s;t but a &s;hort voyage, in which every pa&s;&s;enger mu&s;t meet with &s;ome di&s;|greeable gales, in order to prove his dependance on the hand of infinite goodne&s;s, and &s;hew that he is worthy of entering into an everla&s;ting port. &mdash;Without &s;ome adver&s;e &s;torms to ruffle the &s;ea of life, the tide of pro&s;perity would frequently &s;well the creature into a forgetfulne&s;s of the Creator, and reduce him to a more dangerous &s;ituation than the bittere&s;t bla&s;t he can expe|rience, will ever bring him to; a total indiffe|rence of his God. Out of mercy therefore, a variety of &s;hoals and quick&s;ands are thrown in his way, which keeping the &s;en&s;e of his dependance on the divine Being con&s;tantly alive in this world,

puts him in a capacity of &s;teering his bark in the proper channel, and enables him to arrive at end|le&s;s happine&s;s in the next. &mdash; But ab&s;tracted from this general order in the &s;tate of things; know, Ora&s;min, that becau&s;e thou wert a particular favourite of heaven, it was decreed to &s;natch Almira from thy arms: &s;he was, O man, thy &s;i&s;ter:&mdash;<HI>Ibrahim</HI> thy father, journeying to Bal&s;ora, was admitted to the Cade's wife, and the product of their guilty commerce was Almira: here again ob&s;erve the kindne&s;s of heaven in it's very &s;everities, which, in order to deter the parent from the commi&s;&s;ion of enormities, denounces a judgment again&s;t what he values more highly than worlds, his race &mdash; Ora&s;min be comforted; I have vi&s;ited Almira, and informed her of the&s;e things; &s;he is at ea&s;e, remain thou &s;o too, and remember never again to doubt the goodne&s;s of providence, which in it's own time will reward tho&s;e who place their confidence in it's hands.</Q> Ora&s;min after this lived many years in happine&s;s, and left many children, who &s;ucceeded to his vir|tues and fortune, the elde&s;t of whom was grand vi&s;ier to the Caliph Haroun Alra&s;chid, and ordered the&s;e matters to be recorded in the hi&s;tories of Bagdad.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FORTITUDE and con&s;tancy of mind are qua|lities to which every nation in proportion as it is civilized, lays a formidable claim, and to which however, very few, were we to examine the matter thoroughly, can have any tollerable preten|&s;ion, be&s;ides the compliment which on tho&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, each is &s;o extremely liberal in paying to it&s;elf. In fact, it might not be difficult to prove, from every day's experience, that the propagation of the Sciences, while they improve, generally enervate the mind and that true fortitude and con|&s;tancy of &s;oul, are more the re&s;ult of a &s;elf-ap|proving con&s;cience, than the effect of an excellent under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A NUMBER of philo&s;ophers, who have a&s;toni&s;hed the world with the greatne&s;s of their genius, and the extent of their reading, might talk very pret|tily on this &s;ubject, but when they came once to put any of their own le&s;&s;ons into practice, this boa&s;ted re&s;olution, of which they imagined them|&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, di&s;appeared in an in&s;tant, and from de&s;erving the univer&s;al admiration of mankind, they became entitled to nothing but an ab&s;olute con|tempt. CICERO, in his orations, might expre&s;s the greate&s;t di&s;regard of death he plea&s;ed, and tell us
<PB N="87" REF="102">
that a man &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment, in &s;acrifi|cing his life for the good of his country; but the orator found the practice infinitely harder than the precept, and leagued him&s;elf with the enemies of the public after all, in hope of &s;aving the life, which he affected &s;o highly to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>WHO could talk better upon the virtues, or give more excellent le&s;&s;ons of morality, than our own countryman my lord Saint Albans, yet who when he fell from the pinnacle of honour and preferment, ever &s;hewed a greater &s;ervility of mind, or took more infamous methods to repair his &s;hattered for|tune? &mdash; The mo&s;t &s;candalous adulation that could be paid at court, he was con&s;tantly paying; and not|with&s;tanding after his di&s;grace he was writing a book, which confers an honour on human nature, yet his intervals were taken up in defending every pernicious mea&s;ure of the crown, and employed in de&s;troying the liberty of his country. Need the cau&s;e of his di&s;grace be mentioned here to prove, that notwith&s;tanding his wonderful abilities, he wanted fortitude to re&s;i&s;t the force of a trifling &s;um of money, and hone&s;ty to di&s;charge the important duties of his tru&s;t? or what &s;hall we &s;ay of a man, who, while he was e&s;tabli&s;hing the highe&s;t te&s;timo|ny of human genius, for two or three hundred pounds erected an everla&s;ting monument of human ba&s;ene&s;s too. In reality, &s;cience and under&s;tand|ing, can do nothing more than teach our con&s;tancy and fortitude a nobler way of appearing, the qua|lities them&s;elves mu&s;t proceed from a firmer foun|dation
<PB N="88" REF="103">
than both &mdash; The wi&s;dom of SOCRATES gave <HI>a manner</HI> to his fortitude, which left an irre&s;i&s;tible charm in his death, but the fortitude it&s;elf pro|ceeded not from the excellence of his under&s;tand|ing, but the goodne&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P>BUT to prove beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;pute, that a knowledge of the &s;ciences, has nothing to do in the qualities under con&s;ideration, let us only refer to the behaviour of a poor Indian, as related by Lafitaw, taken in battle by his enemies, and con|demned as a &s;acrifice to the manes of &s;uch as either he him&s;elf or his countrymen de&s;troyed in the field: &mdash; The moment he is condemned, he opens his death &s;ong, and is fa&s;tened to a &s;take, the chiefs of the nation which has taken him, &s;itting round a fire, and &s;moaking all the time. &mdash; Such as choo&s;e to be concerned in the execution, begin with torturing at the extremities of his body, till by degrees they approach the trunk; one pulls off all his nails from the roots; another takes a finger and tears off the fle&s;h with his teeth; a third takes the finger thus mangled, and thru&s;ts it into the bowl of a pipe made red hot, and &s;moaks it like tobacco; others cut and &s;la&s;h the fle&s;hy parts of his body, and &s;ear the wounds immediately up with burning irons; &s;ome &s;trip the &s;kin off his head, and pour boiling lead upon it; others tear the fle&s;h entirely from his arms, and twi&s;t the bare tendrils and &s;inews round red hot irons, twi&s;ting and &s;napping at the &s;ame time; &s;ome pound his fingers and toes to pieces between two &s;tones, others all
<PB N="89" REF="104">
the while di&s;tending and &s;tretching every limb and joint, to encrea&s;e the inconceivable horror of his pains. During this, the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer &s;ome|times rendered in&s;en&s;ible by the torture, falls into &s;o profound a &s;leep, that they are obliged to apply the fire to recover him, and untie him, to give a breathing to the fury of their own revenge. &mdash; Again he is tied, and his teeth drawn one by one, his eyes beat out, and no one trace of humanity left in his vi&s;age; in this &s;ituation, all over one conti|nued mummy, one inexpre&s;&s;ible wound, they beat him from one to another with clubs; the wretch now up now down, falling in their fires at every &s;tep, till at la&s;t, wearied out with cruelty, &s;ome of their chiefs put an end with a dagger, to his &s;uf|ferings, and terminates the execution, which often la&s;ts five or &s;ix hours, by ordering on the kettle and making a fea&s;t as horrid and barbarous as their revenge.</P>
<P>BUT what renders this more &s;urprizing, is a con|te&s;t which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts all the time between the &s;ufferer and them, whether he has mo&s;t fortitude in bear|ing, or they ingenuity in aggravating his pangs; at every interval they give him, he &s;mokes unconcern|ed with the re&s;t, without one murmur or &s;hadow of a groan, recounts what exploits he has done, and tells them how many of their countrymen he has killed, in order to encrea&s;e their fury; nay he reproaches them with an ignorance of torturing, and points out &s;uch parts of his body him&s;elf, as are more exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible of pain &mdash; The women
<PB N="90" REF="105">
have this part of courage with the men, and incre|dible &s;oever as &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing con&s;tancy of mind may appear, it would be as odd to &s;ee one of the&s;e people &s;uffer in another manner, as it would be to find an European who could &s;uffer with any thing like their fortitude; an inflexible unifor|mity to the principles in which they are bred is the occa&s;ion of this fortitude, and without one &s;park of learning, occa&s;ions a behaviour, which di&s;tances the mo&s;t celebrated &s;tories of antiquity, and baffles the profounde&s;t le&s;&s;ons of all the phi|lo&s;ophers.</P>

<P>FEW of the nobler qualifications are &s;o gene|rally pretented to as Friend&s;hip, or a capacity of entertaining &s;o cordial a regard for the intere&s;t of another per&s;on, as to make it equally an object of importance with our own. &mdash; I was talking la&s;t night with my old acquaintance Will Threadbare, on this very &s;ubject, at the Queen's Arms in St. Paul's Church-yard, when Will related over the hi&s;tory of his friend&s;hips to me for the ninety-ninth time, and concluded with his u&s;ual invective again&s;t all the world, and the little confidence which is to be placed in the honour or hone&s;ty of any man.&mdash; To &s;ave him the trouble of repeating his narrative again, I &s;hall take take liberty of making it the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="91" REF="106">
of the pre&s;ent paper; more e&s;pecially as I know the publication can be no way di&s;agreeable to him, and may probably prove of &s;ome enter|tainment to my readers.</P>
<P>FROM my very infancy up, Mr. Babler, &s;ays Will, I found that all tho&s;e attachments which we are weak enough to di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of Friend|&s;hip, were nothing more than the effects of our folly or the con&s;equence of our de&s;ign &mdash; A parity of &s;entiments always created an intimacy between a couple of ra&s;cals, who, willing to believe that they were capable of feeling the exalted glow of a virtuous friend&s;hip, imagined they really did feel it, and having once flattered them&s;elves with this opinion, re&s;ted wonderfully plea&s;ed with the &s;uper|&s;tructure, without ever examining the foundation upon which it was built.</P>
<P>WHEN I was at Eaton, no two in the world could be more intimate; that is, in the language of the world, entertain a greater friend&s;hip for each other, than a fellow who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one of the mo&s;t valuable employments in the kingdom and your humble &s;ervant: how often have we &s;wore that nothing &s;hould ever &s;eparate us when we came into the great theatre of life, as actors for our&s;elves. &mdash; This regard we carried to &s;uch an exce&s;s, that we have frequently boxed one another's battles, and always looked upon the lea&s;t affront offered to either, as an unpardonable injury to both. &mdash; But, alas, Mr. Babler, one Whit&s;un-Monday the pro|vo&s;t, who was an old acquaintance of my father's
<PB N="92" REF="107">
took me out in a chai&s;e with him to a neighbouring gentleman's hou&s;e, and as my friend was not treated with the &s;ame di&s;tinction, he grew envious of his <HI>Pylades,</HI> behaved intolerably cold at our next meet|ing, which I could not but ob&s;erve, and being per|haps a little too tart in my reproaches, he took an occa&s;ion to quarrel with me; the con&s;equence of which was that he and I never &s;poke a word toge|ther after. This lad's e&s;teem for me commenced fir&s;t of all from my dexterity in robbing orchards; an amu&s;ement of which he was particularly fond, and therefore could not help e&s;teeming a temper that bore &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to his own; but as the ba&s;is of our regard was &s;o very trivial in it&s;elf, our friend&s;hip mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have but a &s;lender &s;upport, and therefore a mi&s;under&s;tanding was but a matter of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>AT Oxford I commenced an everla&s;ting friend|&s;hip, to be &s;ure, with Ned Guzzle, becau&s;e I was unalterably attached to the bottle my&s;elf, and he was reckoned the harde&s;t drinker in the Univer&s;ity; our everla&s;ting friend&s;hip however continued but &s;ix weeks, for a couple of unlucky rogues pitted us again&s;t one another to drink for a rump of beef and a dozen of Maderia, in which it being my fortune to &s;wallow half a pint more than my an|tagoni&s;t, he wrote me a letter when he got up next evening, de&s;iring that all manner of corre&s;|pondence might be dropt between us for the future.</P>
<P>WHEN I came up to town and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my little fortune, Dick Wildman and I were in|&s;eparable;
<PB N="93" REF="108">
we lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e, &s;pent every evening at the &s;ame tavern together, and retired every morning with a &s;trumpet to the &s;ame bagnio under the <HI>piazza.</HI> &mdash; We were always coupled in our amours, and never attacked a milliner's apprentice or a trade&s;man's wife unle&s;&s; there were two to find us both employment in the &s;ame family. &mdash; This was not all; I once fought a duel for him behind Montague-hou&s;e, and ran the double chance both of the gallows and cold iron: yet &s;ee the fatality attending all &s;ublunary things; Dick &s;urprized me one morning in bed with one of the maids where we lodged, whom he had been &s;oliciting for &s;ome time, though unknown to me, and was &s;o offended at the un|pardonable preference which the hu&s;&s;ey gave me, that he in&s;tantly ordered his man to pack up his things and decamped next day, without &s;aying a &s;ingle &s;yllable.</P>
<P>I COULD recount a variety of in&s;tances where my friend&s;hips were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, though I never refu&s;ed either my &s;word, or my pur&s;e, to any of tho&s;e partners of my heart; but finding by fatal experience, that no friend&s;hip is la&s;ting which is not founded on Virtue, and believing in my &s;oul, that there is not a &s;park of virtue in any man alive, &mdash; I am ab&s;olutely determined never to have another friend&s;hip, but to &s;tarve as decently as I can upon my &s;eventy pounds a year, and to repeat that admirable &s;entiment of Swift, when any well-behaved

when a few friends meet together, in&s;tead of in|dulging a rational conver&s;ation, you hear of no|thing but a toa&s;t and a &s;ong: the chairman calls in turn upon every one for his toa&s;t, and frequently puts us to a &s;tand for the want of &s;omething &s;pirited or new: in this dilemma, ob&s;cenity or prophana|tion is but too general a re&s;ource, and it is no un|common thing to hear men, of reputed under&s;tand|ing, extol the name of &s;ome public pro&s;titute, and ridicule the precepts of their GOD.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;tom of every man's &s;inging in turn, is &s;till con&s;iderably more ridiculous, and commonly as prophane: at any of the&s;e joyous meetings, even I, who have a voice more di&s;agreeable than the grating of a gate upon hinges, and know no more of mu&s;ic than a Hottentot, can never get excu&s;ed, but mu&s;t make my&s;elf ridiculous in at|tempting what I am utterly incapable of, and di&s;|turb the very people who drive me mo&s;t importu|nately on: how often have I been teized to &s;ing by a number of my intimate acquaintance, and yet the moment I began, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of concealing their di&s;gu&s;t; they whi&s;pered one another, gave a forced attention, or lolled in&s;ipidly in their chairs, &s;troking the pleats of their ruffles, or playing with the chain of their watch, then longing impatiently till I had fini&s;hed, gave a faint bravo, and called out for a toa&s;t from the next member in rotation; whil&s;t I &s;at frying the whole time, from a con&s;cious incapacity to plea&s;e,
<PB N="98" REF="113">
and a &s;trange nece&s;&s;ity of giving a general di&s;|&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, Sir, no cu&s;tom in the world is &s;o very dangerous or unpardonable as toa&s;ting; it levels all di&s;tinction in con&s;titutions, and obliges a man in an indifferent &s;tate of health, to drink as much as him that is ble&s;t with the &s;trength of a Hercules. It is the immediate parent of noi&s;e and intoxica|tion, and among&s;t people of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, an|&s;wers no other purpo&s;e but to leave them without any &s;en&s;e at all.</P>
<P>How prepo&s;terous a notion is it, my dear Sir, to &s;uppo&s;e our joyous &s;ocieties &s;timulated by the prin|ciples of true benevolence or real e&s;teem; when every man has a de&s;ign upon the weakne&s;s or con|&s;titution of his friend, and pu&s;hes the gla&s;s about for no other purpo&s;e, but to prejudice his health and de&s;troy his under&s;tanding: nay, when we make it our chiefe&s;t glory to have drank him out of all knowledge of order, all regard for him&s;elf, and all veneration for his God; when we reduce him to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute phrenzy or &s;tupefaction, and either expo&s;e him to the numberle&s;s quarrels attending the fir&s;t, or the multitude of accidents peculiar to the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;ituations; but Sir, I want to acquaint you with an affair of &s;ome con&s;equence: here Harry he&s;itated, and here I po&s;tpone the account of this affair, till my next paper.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GREAT an oppo&s;ition as there &s;eems be|tween vanity and meanne&s;&s;, yet if we take but ever &s;o cur&s;ory a view of the world, we &s;hall find them to be pretty general companions, and &s;carcely meet a &s;ingle in&s;tance in which there can be di&s;covered any &s;hadow of exception. &mdash; Among my own &s;ex particulary, Mr. Babler, vanity is the parent of &s;o many meanne&s;&s;es, that I am actually &s;urprized when we endeavour to give our&s;elves mo&s;t con&s;equence, that we never perceive how we for|feit all the dignity we ju&s;t before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and in the ridiculous attempt of arrogating our own im|portance, leave our&s;elves in &s;hort without any real importance at all.</P>
<P>THIS is never more the ca&s;e, Sir, than when we li&s;ten to the &s;olicitations of your &s;ex, and for the &s;ake of a de&s;picable compliment to our teeth or our complexion, overlook the unpardonable affront which it generally conveys, and take no notice of the very poor opinion it in&s;inuates both for the purity of our hearts and the rectitude of our un|der&s;tandings. &mdash; We &s;uffer the mo&s;t illiberal ad|dre&s;&s;es to be paid us, if they are but &s;oftened with the words angel and godde&s;s, and admit a de&s;ign|ing villain as often as he plea&s;es into our pre&s;ence,
<PB N="105" REF="120">
though we know our ruin and di&s;grace are the only objects of his pur&s;uit, if he but prai&s;es the colour of our hair, and tells us we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of finer eyes than the re&s;t of our acquaintance. &mdash; In &s;hort, Sir, we are willing a man &s;hould think there is a probability of our launching into infamy and pro|&s;titution, for the &s;ake of hearing our per&s;ons com|mended; and perfectly reconciled while he treats us on a footing with the hand&s;ome&s;t women he may know, to his thinking, that in time he &s;hall num|ber us with the very wor&s;t.</P>
<P>A WOMAN, Sir, whenever &s;he is told of her beauty with a grave face, &s;hould fir&s;t of all con&s;i|der the purpo&s;e for which &s;he may be addre&s;&s;ed in this manner, and reflect upon the motive which may actuate the per&s;on who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;o &s;en&s;ible of her perfections: &mdash; Nothing is more dangerous than to &s;uffer continued repetitions of this &s;tile; it gradually becomes more and more plea&s;ing to the ear, and there is, be&s;ides, too natu|ral a promptitude in the female mind to think fa|vourably of tho&s;e who &s;eem to think pa&s;&s;ionately of us. &mdash; A language of this nature, therefore, &s;hould be highly alarming to our ears, for many a woman, who thought her&s;elf impregnable, has, in a length of time, grown &s;o enamoured of her own prai&s;e, that &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t without the per&s;on who admini&s;tered it, and has at la&s;t made a &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, when had &s;he fir&s;t of all capitulated on terms, &s;he might have in&s;i&s;ted on the very be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="121">LET us only reduce the general tendency of mo|dern addre&s;&s;es into plain Engli&s;h, Mr. Babler, and a&s;k the mo&s;t indi&s;creet of the &s;ex, if they can, in their con&s;cience, di&s;cover them to be a jot better than this&mdash; <Q>Madam, I look upon you as a fool, and one whom I have a &s;trong inclination to make a &s;trumpet, for which rea&s;on I intend to talk continually of your charms, and by &s;acri|ficing in that manner to your vanity, I have no doubt, but in a few days, I &s;hall bring you to an utter di&s;regard of morality and virtue, to an ab&s;olute contempt of all the laudable &s;entiments which you have been imbibing &s;o many years, and a total indifference for your own reputation and the honour of your &s;ex. As I think your wickedne&s;s equal to your folly, I beg, when I mention the word <HI>beauty,</HI> that you will prefer the gratification of the man who is your greate&s;t enemy, to the peace of tho&s;e who are your unal|terable friends; nor he&s;itate a moment to break the heart of a parent that tenderly loves you, to plea&s;e an infamous &s;coundrel who labours for your everla&s;ting di&s;grace. &mdash; In &s;hort, Madam, I expect in return for a paltry compliment to your per&s;on, that you &s;cruple not to endure continual &s;hame in this world, nor &s;hrink at ha|zarding your eternal happine&s;s in the next; but run at once to plunge a dagger into the brea&s;t of your father, and hurl an impious defiance at the very throne of your God.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="122">I HAD my&s;elf, Mr. Babler, lately two or three lovers who kindly &s;aid very pretty things to my per&s;on, and would you believe it, that one of them was a married man! &mdash; This Gentleman came one day with all the ea&s;y impudence in life, and with as much compo&s;ure as if he had been really per|forming a meritorious action, threw him&s;elf at my feet, and &s;wore he could not live unle&s;s I pitied him. &mdash; Had I a dagger I believe I &s;hould have &s;tuck it in the villain's heart: however, a&s;&s;uming all the anger I po&s;&s;ibly could, in a face not natu|rally the mo&s;t placid, I mentioned &s;ome thoughts of paying a vi&s;it to his wife, which effectually bani&s;hed him from my pre&s;ence without doing the &s;malle&s;t injury to his health, or di&s;turbing in the lea&s;t, the u&s;ual &s;erenity of his temper.</P>
<P>A LORD next told me I was the mo&s;t angelic piece of fle&s;h and blood he had ever beheld, and &s;olicited, in good earne&s;t, that I would ble&s;s him with my favourable opinion; but I had no &s;ooner talked of coronets on my coach, than the truly honourable earl &s;neaked in&s;tantly off, excu&s;ing him&s;elf on account of a treaty then in agitation with Lady Betty Squander.</P>
<P>WHAT you men think of us, Mr. Babler, I know not, nor indeed can I conceive what we wo|men in general think of our&s;elves; but of this I am ab&s;olutely certain, that while we continue &s;o intolerably vain, we mu&s;t be liable to an infinity of meanne&s;&s;es, and that the &s;ure&s;t way for any woman to be undone is to think there is nobody comparable to her&s;elf.</P>

<P>OF all the requi&s;ites e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to form a matrimonial felicity, a parity of ages may po&s;&s;ibly be the very fir&s;t; and if we were to take a nice &s;urvey of the various di&s;proportioned matches which unhappily might be found within the Weekly Bills, the endle&s;s anxieties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between each, would be &s;ufficient to frighten any prudent parent from be&s;towing his daughter's hand where there was not &s;ome equality of years; and at lea&s;t a probability that her rea&s;on would in time reconcile her to a hu&s;band, who, perhaps, might not at fir&s;t be the object of her choice.</P>
<P>I AM very well aware, that many a careful father and antiquated lover, will be apt to exclaim again&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion: the fir&s;t from an oeconomical con|&s;ideration of the main chance, and the latter from a natural in&s;en&s;ibility which every man entertains for his own imperfections and infirmities: but could the one be brought to a belief that wealth, at the be&s;t of times, is a very precarious founda|tion for happine&s;s; and the other be only pre|vailed upon to throw &s;elf a&s;ide for a moment or two, extraordinary as the po&s;ition may &s;eem on a partial con&s;ideration, both would neverthele&s;s allow it to be of no little force.</P>
<P>CASUAL aver&s;ions may be le&s;&s;ened in time, by an invariable tenderne&s;s, and an unexceptionable

conduct in a hu&s;band; per&s;onal defects, by being habitual to the eye, gradually le&s;&s;en on the imagi|nation, and by an uninterrupted familiarity, very frequently cea&s;e to be di&s;agreeable, much more continue to give perpetual di&s;gu&s;t: but a di&s;parity of years is an ob&s;tacle never to be &s;urmounted; every day gives it an additional force, and contrary to the general nature of all other evils, for in this ca&s;e we mu&s;t inevitably call it an evil, in&s;tead of being mitigated by the lenient hand of time, it becomes every moment more and more incapable of alleviation or cure.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the long train of di&s;agreeable re|flexions which the bare circum&s;tance of age is of it&s;elf capable of exciting in the bo&s;om of any young woman, the innumerable li&s;t of di&s;ea&s;es, which are it's in&s;eparable attendants, occa&s;ion &s;till &s;tronger aver&s;ion; and in reality a young lady has but too much ground for anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s when &s;he con&s;iders her&s;elf as a &s;acrifice to &s;ame venerable dotard, and in&s;tead of the rea&s;onable plea&s;ures &s;he might ju&s;tly promi&s;e her&s;elf upon entering the world as a wife, &s;ees nothing before her but the gloomy pro&s;pect of becoming a nur&s;e to an emaciated wretch, worn away with the con&s;equences of juvenile intemperance, and ab&s;olutely dying with gouts, pal&s;ies, rheumati&s;ms, coughs, and catarrhs.</P>
<P>CONTRADICTIONS &s;o very oppo&s;ite as extreme youth and age, there is hardly a po&s;&s;ibility of reconciling; &mdash; a fine &s;prightly girl of nineteen or twenty, mu&s;t naturally wi&s;h for amu&s;ements
<PB N="110" REF="125">
adapted to her time of life, and langui&s;h for &s;uch enjoyments as are naturally repugnant to the &s;enti|ments as well as the infirmities of crazy four&s;core. The &s;ituation of &s;uch a couple is ea&s;ily imagined; the lady mu&s;t be continually unhappy at being thus debarred, after the &s;acrifice &s;he has made, from every entertainment &s;uitable to her temper and her years, and the gentleman as con&s;tantly mi&s;erable at po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an impotent authority, productive of nothing but eternal &s;u&s;picions of her conduct, and the &s;harpe&s;t reflexions on his own.</P>
<P>IT is in vain to expect that the rectitude of a woman's education, thus circum&s;tanced, or the excellence of her under&s;tanding, will be a means of procuring even a tolerable tranquility or content; the more under&s;tanding &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the more &s;he mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e the &s;elf-intere&s;ted dotard, who was utterly regardle&s;s of her inclinations; who in all probability u&s;ed his utmo&s;t influence with a mi&s;|guided and inexorable parent, to tear her from &s;ome de&s;erving young fellow on whom her &s;oul was unalterably fixed, and perhaps, had her dragged to the bridal bed, like another <HI>Niobe,</HI> &s;tiffning into horror, or di&s;&s;olving in her tears.</P>
<P>IN a &s;ituation of this nature, how a man can be weak enough to look for tenderne&s;s or affection, from any young lady, is to me a miracle; nor am I le&s;s &s;urprized how he can think of exciting her gratitude, by indulging her in trivial points, when he has &s;o infamou&s;ly injured her in the mo&s;t capital
<PB N="111" REF="126">
of all; her everla&s;ting hatred and abhorrence are the only returns he can rea&s;onably look for, and if there is a po&s;&s;ibility for her to view him with le&s;s than an in&s;uperable contempt, I am &s;atisfied, he mu&s;t look upon her as a creature utterly dive&s;ted of &s;en&s;ibility and &s;oul, and view her with an ab&s;o|lute contempt him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AN infinity of rea&s;ons might be urged again&s;t the di&s;parity of age in matrimonial connections, but as I have lately received a &s;tory on this &s;ub|ject which will &s;et this affair in a &s;tronger light than a volume of declamatory arguments, I &s;hall conclude the &s;ubject, for the pre&s;ent, with this ob&s;ervation, that he who marries a woman whom he knows has an attachment for another man, mu&s;t look for wretchedne&s;s; and he that marries a woman contrary to her inclination, in reality de&s;erves it.</P>

<P>BEING la&s;t Ea&s;ter, Sir, at my &s;on's in the coun|try, I accidentally &s;aw a young lady who was intimately acquainted with my grand-daughter Sally, and whom, on enquiry, I found to be the daughter of a curate lately &s;ettled in tho&s;e parts, who had nothing to maintain a wife and four chil|dren but a &s;lender forty pounds a year. &mdash; Maria, the young lady's name in que&s;tion, was the elde&s;t, and had no other fortune than a mo&s;t engaging per&s;on, an irre&s;i&s;table face, a good heart, and a fine under&s;tanding. &mdash; The&s;e however had procured her the addre&s;&s;es of one Mr. Markham, a very worthy young fellow in the neighbourhood, who had newly &s;et up in the grocery trade, with a capital of 3000l. and who, by her father's permi&s;&s;ion and the con&s;ent of his own friends, was to be married to her on the Sunday fortnight following.</P>
<P>THERE was a &s;omething &s;o engaging about Maria, Mr. Babler, as &s;trangely affected me, and made me at once both very unea&s;y and very much a&s;hamed. All thoughts of an intercour&s;e with the &s;ex at my time of life, I was &s;en&s;ible &s;hould have totally &s;ub|&s;ided; yet, notwith&s;tanding a conviction of that nature, I was determined, if there was a po&s;&s;ibility or my &s;ucceeding, to have her. &mdash; In vain my &s;on pointed out the ridicule I &s;hould incur by &s;o di&s;proportioned a match; in vain did my daughter, nay my grand-daughter too, endeavour
<PB N="113" REF="128">
to laugh me out of &s;o prepo&s;terous a de&s;ign; and in vain did my own reflexion dwell upon the &s;triking di&s;parity of years, and the greatne&s;s of my infir|mities. &mdash; My authority &s;ilenced the remon&s;trances of my children, and my vanity turned a deaf ear to the &s;elf-convicted poignancy of my own. &mdash; The circum&s;tance of years I thought my genero&s;ity would &s;ufficiently counterballance, and as for my di&s;orders, I fancied my cough was con&s;iderably abated, and that under a proper regimen, my gout might be rendered le&s;s trouble&s;ome, and the rheum of my eyes totally removed. &mdash; I &s;ent for an empiric to make me a hand&s;ome &s;et of teeth; exchanged my venerable tye, for a &s;mart fa&s;hionable bob, affected to read without &s;pectacles, and threw by my crutch headed &s;tick.</P>
<P>NOT to trouble you, Sir, Mr. Gra&s;ply, Maria's father, the moment I propo&s;ed a jointure was in a tran&s;port; a promi&s;e of providing for his other children threw him into an ec&s;tacy, and the rever|&s;ion of a good living on my own e&s;tate, rendered him incapable of &s;peaking a &s;ingle word. &mdash; Maria, after a thou&s;and intreaties and as many floods of tears, not to be &s;acrificed, as &s;he called it; and a vain attempt of e&s;caping to her dear Mr. Mark|ham, was dragged to church in three days after, and came home Mrs. Totterly.</P>
<P>HAVING thus fortunately &s;ecured her for my wife, I thought my felicity almo&s;t compleated, and that the moment her tears were a little dried up, I &s;hould be the happie&s;t of men. &mdash; But alas,
<PB N="114" REF="129">
Mr. Babler, I found a great difference betwixt the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an unwilling hand and the enjoyment of a warm reciprocally beating heart: it required but &s;mall penetration to di&s;cover that I was the object of her unalterable aver&s;ion, and that the violence I had done to her real inclinations would plant perpetual thorns on her pillow, and fix ever|la&s;ting anxiety on mine.</P>
<P>I WILL not trouble you, Mr. Babler, with a repe|tition of particular circum&s;tances; &s;uffice it, that notwith&s;tanding I have u&s;ed every method I could po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e to excite her gratitude or engage her e&s;teem, in the calme&s;t of her moments, &s;he looks upon me with a rooted hatred, or a contemp|tuous di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;I in vain tempt her with equipage and dre&s;s; if the carriage is ordered to the door &s;he has the head ach; and if I order home a fre&s;h piece of &s;ilk, it is thrown neglected on the floor.&mdash; In&s;tead of mixing with &s;ociety, &s;he &s;huts her&s;elf up the principal part of the day in her clo&s;et, and if I chance by accident to break in, I &s;urprize her in tears.&mdash;If my infirmities oblige me to the u&s;e of a &s;eparate bed, I am unea&s;y at being from her, and yet I am mi&s;erable by the horror &s;he expre&s;&s;es in her looks, if they do not: if &s;he chances to doze, the heavine&s;s of her &s;ighs di&s;tract me to the la&s;t degree, and if &s;he mentions the word Markham in her dreams, as &s;he frequently does, it is a &s;corpion of the mo&s;t deadly na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure, and &s;tings me to the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="130">UPON the whole, Mr. Babler, a&s;leep or awake, at bed, or at board, I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men; and what, like a ridiculous dotard, I fan|cied would prove the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of my life, by a ju&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation of providence, turns out my unalterable cur&s;e.&mdash;O Sir, to a man not altogether de&s;titute of &s;en&s;ibility, what &s;ituation can be &s;o truly wretched as mine? without a friend to whom I can vent my griefs, without a bo&s;om which I dare beg to pity my di&s;tre&s;s, to be de&s;pi&s;ed by the woman I doat upon to madne&s;s, and to be a real object of contempt to my&s;elf, is too much! &mdash; to be loaded with years, and &s;o born down with infirmities, as to &s;tand one continued mummy of emac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, one complicated hoard of di&s;ea&s;e, is a dreadful reflexion for a new married man. &mdash; A man totally incapable of in&s;piring a pa&s;&s;ion of the lea&s;t tender nature, and as totally incapable of gratifying it if he could.</P>
<P>FROM my &s;tory let other dotards beware of fol|lowing my example; for be a&s;&s;ured, Mr. Babler, wherever there is a &s;triking di&s;parity of years, and the odds again&s;t the man, a very little time will convince him of his error, and make him wi&s;h, with me, that he had &s;ent for an Undertaker and been buried fifty fathom quick before he made &s;o prepo&s;terous a choice of a wife.</P>

<HEAD>NUMB. XXVII. <HI>Saturday, Augu&s;t</HI> 13.</HEAD>
<P>I SUPPED la&s;t Night at my &s;i&s;ter Rattle's, where the di&s;cour&s;e turning upon the edudation of children, my favourite Harry related a little &s;tory, with which I was prodigiou&s;ly affected; and as it conveys a very pretty moral, I &s;hall make no apology for pre&s;enting it to my readers</P>
<P>A WORTHY old gentleman, who had by an in|flexible indu&s;try acquired a large fortune, with great reputation, at length declining bu&s;ine&s;s; devoted his &s;ole attention to the &s;ettlement of an only &s;on, of whom he was uncommonly fond.&mdash; In a little time he married him to a woman of fa|mily, and judging of the &s;on's affection by his own, made over every &s;hilling he was worth to the young gentleman, de&s;iring nothing more than to be a witne&s;s of his happine&s;s in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and depending upon his gratitude for any cur&s;ory trifle he might want, for the private u&s;e of his pur&s;e. &mdash; The &s;on had not been married however above &s;ix weeks, before he was under the &s;ole do|minion of his wife, and prevailed upon to treat the old gentleman with the mo&s;t mortifying neg|lect. &mdash; If he wanted the carriage for an airing, why truly, "My Lady has engaged it:" If he de&s;ired to mix in any little party of plea&s;ure, "They were quite full:" He was &s;uffered to &s;it whole evenings without being once &s;poken to;
<PB N="117" REF="132">
at table he was obliged to call three or four times for a gla&s;s of wine, or a bit of bread, and if he ever entered into a narrative of any tran&s;action which occurred in his youth, his obliging daughter in-law immediately broke in upon him, and politely in|troduced a conver&s;ation upon &s;omething el&s;e. &mdash; This unpardonable contempt was at la&s;t carried to &s;uch a degree, that his cough was complained of as trouble&s;ome, and under a pretence that his to|bacco box was in&s;upportable, he was reque&s;ted to eat in his own room.</P>
<P>FOUR or five years pa&s;&s;ed on in this manner, which were rendered a little tolerable by the birth of a grand&s;on, a mo&s;t engaging boy, who, from the moment he was capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing, &s;eem|ed to be very fond of the old gentleman, and by an almo&s;t in&s;tinctive attachment, appeared as if providentially de&s;igned to atone for the unnatural ingratitude of it's father. &mdash; He was now turned of four, when one day &s;ome per&s;ons of fa&s;hion dining at the hou&s;e, the old gentleman, who knew no|thing of the company, came down into the back parlour to enquire for his little favourite, who had been two whole hours out of his apartment: he had no &s;ooner opened the door, than his dutiful &s;on, before a room full of people, a&s;ked him how he dare break in upon him without leave, and de|&s;ired him to get in&s;tantly up about his bu&s;ine&s;s. &mdash; The old gentleman withdrew according to order, returned to his own room, and gave a very hearty freedom to his tears.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="133">LITTLE Tommy, who could not bear to hear his grand-papa chided at &s;uch a rate, followed him in&s;tantly, and ob&s;erving how heartily he &s;obbed, came roaring down to the parlour, and before the whole company bawled out, <Q>papa has made poor grand-papa break his heart; he will cry his eyes out above &s;tairs.</Q> &mdash; The &s;on, who was really &s;hamed of his conduct, e&s;pecially as he &s;aw no &s;ign of approbation in the faces of his friends, endea|voured to put an ea&s;y appearance on the affair, and brazen it out; turning round therefore to the child, he de&s;ired him to carry a blanket to grand-papa, and bid him go beg. &mdash; <HI>Ay, but I will not give him all the blanket,</HI> returned the child; &mdash; <HI>why &s;o my dear?</HI> &s;ays the father; <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> (an&s;wered he) <HI>I &s;hall want half for you, when I grow up to be a man, and turn you out of doors.</HI> &mdash; The child's re|proof &s;tung the father to the &s;oul, and held up at once both the cruelty and ingratitude of his conduct in their proper dyes: nay, the wi&s;e &s;eem|ed affected and wanted words: a good natured tear dropped from more than one of the company, who &s;eized this opportunity of condemning, in a very candid manner, their behaviour to &s;o effectio|nate a father, and &s;o bountiful a friend; and in &s;hort, made them &s;o heartily a&s;hamed of them&s;elves, that the old gentleman was immediately &s;ent for by both, who, in the pre&s;ence of all, mo&s;t hum|bly entreated his forgivene&s;s for every thing pa&s;t, and promi&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives would be to oblige him for the future. &mdash; The poor old gen|tleman's
<PB N="119" REF="134">
joy threatened now to be much more fatal than his affliction a little before: &mdash; he looked upon his &s;on and daughter for &s;ome time with a mute a&s;toni&s;hment, mixed with a tenderne&s;s im|po&s;&s;ible to be de&s;cribed; and then fixing his eyes upon the company with a wildne&s;s of inconceiv|able rapture, &s;natched up his little Tommy to his bo&s;om, who joined him in a hearty flood of Tears.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing, in reality, where people are &s;o very wrong, as the education of children, though there is nothing in which they ought to be more ab&s;olutely certain of being right: if we &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon the cu&s;tomary method in which chil|dren are brought up, we mu&s;t almo&s;t imagine, that the generality of parents inculcate principles of religion and virtue into their offspring, for the meer &s;atisfaction of bringing both religion and virtue into contempt; and paint the precepts of morality in the mo&s;t engaging colours, to &s;hew, by their practice, how much the&s;e precepts are to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>MY friend Ned Head&s;trong is a parent of this ca&s;t; he is continually preaching up a rectitude of conduct to a very &s;en&s;ible young fellow his &s;on, and yet as continually de&s;troying by his example what he labours to effect by his advice. Ned expatiates largely about patience under the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, and yet will fly into a pa&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t ungovernable nature, if a leg of mutton is boiled a minute too much. &mdash; I have heard him launch forth in the prai&s;e of fortitude, while he
<PB N="120" REF="135">
has not been able to overcome the chagrin occa&s;i|oned by &s;pilling a drop of port upon the table|coth; and very frequently li&s;tened to a lecture again&s;t a profligate mention of the divine name, inter&s;per&s;ed with a variety of horrid execrations.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame prepo&s;terous incon&s;i&s;tency in the edu|cation of an only daughter is a di&s;tingui&s;hing pecu|liar of lady Dye Dawd e. &mdash; Her lady&s;hip is no great gadabout, for &s;he lies in bed all the day, and plays at cards all night; &s;he cannot be accu&s;ed of mi&s;behaviour in church, for I am not &s;uppo&s;e &s;he has been once at a place of public wor&s;hip the&s;e twenty years. &mdash; A trade&s;man can never call twice at her hou&s;e for a bill, for there is not one who has the lea&s;t acquaintance with her character that would tru&s;t her with a yard of ribbon or a row of pins. &mdash; Her reputation has never been &s;u&s;pected, for there is not a man in England who would think it worth his while to accept of the highe&s;t favour &s;he &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly grant; and as for her veracity, that can by no means admit of a de|bate, for it is a que&s;tion with me if &s;he &s;poke a &s;yllable of truth &s;ince her arrival at maturity. &mdash; Yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e negative perfections, &s;he is continually pre&s;cribing a contrary practice to her daughter, and perpetually condemning the young lady for the lea&s;t imitation of what &s;he is uncea&s;ing practi&s;ingly her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this paper with a bit of advice addre&s;&s;ed to every order of my readers: &mdash; if a pa|rent in reality would have his &s;on a good man, let
<PB N="121" REF="136">
him teach by his practice as much as by his pre|cept, and never, through a doating partiality, over|look tho&s;e actions in a child which he would in|evitably condemn in any body el&s;e. Finally, let all parents, from the introductory part of this paper, con&s;ider that it is no di&s;grace for a &s;on to be de|pendant on a father's bounty, but that nothing can be more dangerous than for a father to be dependant on a &s;on's.</P>

<P>THERE is no &s;et of men to whom I have a greater aver&s;ion than your profe&s;&s;ed &s;ayers of <HI>bon mots,</HI> or &s;putterers of <HI>good things,</HI> who go into company for no other rea&s;on in nature, but to catch at every little opportunity of being &s;mart, and build a reputation of wit and vivacity upon the harmle&s;s peculiarities or ca&s;ual indi&s;cretions of their acquaintance. This &s;pecies of impertinents, if we properly examine the principles upon which they act, are not more to be de&s;pi&s;ed for the continual air of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency they a&s;&s;ume, than for the malevolence of their di&s;po&s;itions, in wi&s;hing to di&s;|concert, where real good-nature and true politene&s;s &s;hould be &s;tudious to oblige. Yet notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t number of the&s;e worthy gentlemen affect a &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding above the re&s;t of the world, a &s;en&s;ible ob&s;erver will find, that the very be&s;t is &s;eldom more than a &s;quirt charged
<PB N="122" REF="137">
with the trite relations of de&s;picable je&s;t books and common-place remarks, to be let off as occa&s;ion may ari&s;e, in whatever company it may be their fortune to be introduced.</P>
<P>AS the vanity of being admired engro&s;&s;es their whole ambition, a Wit of this cla&s;s is not le&s;s a di&s;agreeable acquaintance than a dangerous friend: he is incapable of confidence, and where-ever a &s;ecret of the mo&s;t important nature with which he is tru&s;ted, may unhappily interfere with an opportunity of gratifying his natural propen&s;ity, his di&s;cretion is in an in&s;tant kicked down &s;tairs by his pride, and the peace of a whole family, in all probability, &s;acrificed to an indeli|cate repartee, or an ignorant joke. Nay, no con&s;ideration, either moral or religious, is able to re&s;train the torrent of his impertinence; and is it not too common a circum&s;tance, that where hu|man obligations afford him no &s;ubject of exerci&s;ing his talents, that he bur&s;ts at once through the mo&s;t awful of the divine, and circulates a daring laugh at the mandates of his God! In &s;hort the mo&s;t bearable of this fraternity is always a plague to &s;ociety, and not very &s;eldom a di&s;grace.</P>
<P>SHOULD we carry our &s;peculations on this &s;ub|ject &s;till farther, it might probably be found, that one half of our modern infidels is produced by the ab&s;urd affection of &s;aying a good thing, and the de&s;ire of being thought uncommonly &s;hrewd by the generality of the world. In order to effect this, a &s;ingularity of opinion is fir&s;t of all adopt|ed,
<PB N="123" REF="138">
and the more dangerous this opinion is, the more it an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of being talked of, and renders the per&s;on who adopts it, pointed out from the ordinary cla&s;&s;es of mankind. This &s;ingula|rity of &s;entiment of cour&s;e occa&s;ions a &s;ingularity of expre&s;&s;ion, and the con&s;equence at la&s;t is, that the unhappy wretch who thus aims at univer&s;al admiration, je&s;ts him&s;elf out of every &s;en&s;ible and worthy man's e&s;teem here, and laughs away his hopes of hereafter too.</P>
<P>AN old &s;chool-fellow of mine, poor Dick Brazen, is one of tho&s;e men who&s;e principal &s;tudy is to attract the attention of their acquaintance by a &s;martne&s;s of repartee, and a poignancy of &s;atire in the application of a joke. Dick's whole labour the&s;e forty years, has been to make him&s;elf a very di&s;agreeable companion; and I cannot help &s;ay|ing he has been no way di&s;appointed in his end. The moment he enters a room, and makes his bow, he &s;its with the utmo&s;t patience to catch at any expre&s;&s;ion which may admit of a &s;arca&s;m, and is &s;ure, without any regard to the condition or &s;ex of the &s;peaker, to u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours to turn it into ridicule or contempt. If nothing of this kind happens, he make him&s;elf the hero of &s;ome little tale, and perhaps tells a hundred im|pertinent &s;tories for the &s;ake of relating what he &s;aid upon &s;uch and &s;uch a circum&s;tance; how he put lady This-thing, out of countenance with an ob&s;ervation upon a pincu&s;hion, and cut up Sir John T'other, with a &s;troke upon a &s;nuff-box. The
<PB N="124" REF="139">
wor&s;t of all is, the &s;ame ob&s;ervation which that ce|lebrated reprobate the earl of Roche&s;ter made on Charles the &s;econd for the continual repetition of his &s;tories, may, with all imaginable ju&s;tice, be applied to Mr. Brazen. That monarch had a cu&s;|tom of telling every day, in the circle, a thou|&s;and trifling occurrences of his youth, and would con&s;tantly repeat them over and over again, with|out the &s;malle&s;t variation; &s;o that &s;uch of his courtiers as were acquainted with his maje&s;ty's foible, would in&s;tantly retreat whenever he began any of his narrations.&mdash;My lord Roche&s;ter being with him one day, took the liberty of being very &s;evere upon that head; <Q>Your maje&s;ty, (&s;ays he) has undoubtedly the be&s;t memory in the world; I have heard you repeat the &s;ame &s;tory, without the variation of a &s;yllable, every day the&s;e ten years; but what I think extraordinary is, that you never recollect you generally tell it to the &s;ame &s;et of auditors.</Q>&mdash;This is Mr. Brazen's fault, and indeed the fault of ever worthy member of his brotherhood; they are very happy in remembering every good thing they have &s;aid, but con&s;tantly forget, they have retailed it perhaps five hundred times upon the &s;ame company.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this paper with an anecdote of the identical Mr. Brazen, whom I have thus taken the liberty of introducing to my readers, and which I think is a general picture of all the clever fellows of this cla&s;s within the bills of mortality. Being carried to &s;up one night, by a friend, with a
<PB N="125" REF="140">
company of very &s;en&s;ible people whom he had ne|ver &s;een before, Dick was &s;o very much plea&s;ed, that he was extremely mortified, or in other words, found no opportunity of exerci&s;ing his talent for <HI>bon mots.</HI> &mdash; Being a&s;ked to the &s;ame party a &s;econd time, <Q>No, no, &s;ays he, I have been di&s;appointed already, and will never &s;it twice in a company which I cannot laugh at, by G&mdash;d.</Q></P>

<P>THERE is nothing at which I am more offended, than the unpardonable vein of ignorance and brutality &s;o generally introduced in our drinking &s;ongs; nor any thing, in my opinion, which throws a greater reflexion upon the under|&s;tanding of a &s;en&s;ible &s;ociety. If we examine the principal number of the&s;e pretty compo&s;itions, we &s;hall find, that ab&s;olute intoxication is recommend|ed as the highe&s;t felicity in the world, and receive the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances of being upon an equality with angels, the very moment we &s;ink our&s;elves into a &s;ituation con&s;iderably lower than men.</P>
<P>To look back to the original de&s;ign of all poe|tical compo&s;ition is needle&s;s, &s;ince every body knows that it was to prai&s;e and honour the Supreme Being with a fervency of devotion, which could not be found in the common form of words. &mdash; This glorification of the Deity, and the in&s;truction of his creatures, appearing therefore to be the grand view of poetry, how much is it to be lamented, that a &s;cience of &s;o &s;ublime a nature, &s;hould be pro&s;tituted to &s;uch infamous ends; and, in&s;tead of being applied to the purpo&s;es of religion and virtue, be directed to the &s;upport of a vice, productive of innumerable ills.</P>

<P>BUT if, ab&s;tracted from the brutal intention of our drinking &s;ongs, in general we &s;hould come to con&s;ider their merit as literary performances, how very few of them &s;hould we find worth a &s;tation on a cobler's &s;tall, or de&s;erving the attention of an auditory at Billing&s;gate; &mdash; the be&s;t are but &s;o many de&s;picable &s;trings of unmeaning puns and ill-imagined conceits, and betray not more the ig|norance of their encouragers, than the barrenne&s;s of their authors. &mdash; Let me only a&s;k the warme&s;t advocate for this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, what, upon a cool reflexion, he thinks of the following &s;ong:</P>

<P>AN ea&s;ine&s;s of behaviour through the common occurrences of life, is a point in which al|mo&s;t every per&s;on thinks him&s;elf an admirable proficient; yet it is neverthele&s;s a matter in which almo&s;t every per&s;on is very widely deceived.

<P><PB N="133" REF="148">AN endeavour at an extraordinary degree of politene&s;s, is a rock upon which numbers are per|petually &s;plitting, and what is mo&s;t &s;urprizing, the variety of examples, in&s;tead of deterring us from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n imitation of the practice, are rather additional incentives for the continuation of the pur&s;uit: na|turally prompt to think we our&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s more abilities than our neighbours, we are perpetually &s;olicitous for their being di&s;played; and confining our ob&s;ervations for ever to the agreeable &s;ide of things, we ab&s;olutely forget that they have the &s;malle&s;t rever&s;e.</P>
<P>MRS. NOTABLE, an old widow cou&s;in of my own, is the very quinte&s;cence of modern politene&s;s and good nature; once every Chri&s;tmas I have the honour of an invitation among a great number of other relations, and then have a perfect opportu|nity of contemplating the elaborate ea&s;e of this obliging gentlewoman; the moment we enter, &s;he makes it a particular rule to enquire after the health of the whole company, and the in&s;tant we are &s;eated, comes regularly round to every indivi|dual, and demands a circum&s;tantial account of the minute&s;t occurrence &s;ince &s;he had la&s;t the happine&s;s of &s;eeing us: if any one by accident has laboured under a &s;light cold, all the recipes in the complete hou&s;ewife are thundered about our ears, and an infinity of lamentations poured out for &s;o irrepara|ble a misfortune.

trifling kind to my cou&s;in; however &s;he would not be robbed of an opportunity of &s;hewing both her knowledge and politene&s;s, and therefore intro|duced her favourite topic with the greate&s;t facility, good naturedly lamenting a &s;econd time for a &s;ore throat which my &s;i&s;ter Rattle had been laid up with the preceding twelvemonth.</P>
<P>BUT if this preparatory account of Mrs. No|table's politene&s;s, has given the reader a high opi|nion of her character, what will he &s;ay, when I carry him through the ceremony of dinner, and touch upon the unremitting &s;ollicitude which &s;he manife&s;ts for the accommodation of the company: notwith&s;tanding her table is generally as well &s;up|plied as any woman's in the kingdom, and not|with&s;tanding &s;he does not a little pique her&s;elf upon the elegance of this annual entertainment, yet the moment it is brought up, we have a thou|&s;and excu&s;es made for the poverty of our dinner. &mdash; Well! lord! I don't believe you can touch a bit on't&mdash; but you are &s;o good &mdash; though I wonder how you come a &s;econd time to a place &s;o utterly unprovided! &mdash; this we under&s;tand as a proper cue to prai&s;e every thing before us, and then are obliged to &s;tand a whole volley of encomiums on our extraordinary goodne&s;s, till at la&s;t, when we have in a manner half bur&s;t our&s;elves, and are told how very little we have eat; a fre&s;h concern for the badne&s;s of our entertainment concludes the fea&s;t, and relieves us a little from the fatigue of &s;uch extraordinary politene&s;s.</P>

In the company of the ladies he &s;its con&s;tantly covered, never helps a &s;oul at his own table, though he has an ab&s;olute &s;tranger at dinner; nor ever makes any &s;cruple to tell a woman &s;he lies, in plain Engli&s;h: as Sir Harry would not be thought a coxcomb for the univer&s;e, he carefully avoids the &s;malle&s;t indica|tion of that character in his appearance; he &s;eldom &s;haves above once a week, &s;carcely ever combs his hair, chews an enormous quantity of tobacco, and makes a point of going into well dre&s;t companies with a dirty &s;hirt: upon the whole, to e&s;cape the imputation of ceremonious, he becomes in all places offen&s;ive, and for fear of deviating into an effeminate puppy, as he calls it, he throws off all preten&s;ion to decency, and &s;inks into an ab&s;olute brute.</P>

<P>FILIAL piety is a flower of &s;o delicate a nature, that we meet but very few places which can produce it; and though we frequent|ly hear of parents who ruin them&s;elves for the &s;ake of their children, yet, we &s;eldom or ever hear of children who do any extraordinary acts of kindne&s;s to their parents. &mdash; Perhaps na|ture has formed the parental &s;en&s;ibility, infinitely more exqui&s;ite than the filial, and, for &s;ome wi&s;e purpo&s;e, implanted a much greater fondne&s;s on our minds for tho&s;e we beget and educate, than for tho&s;e by whom we are begotten and edu|cated our&s;elves; at lea&s;t cu&s;tom has firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;uch different &s;entiments relative to the be|haviour of parent and child, that it is thought a matter of the highe&s;t prai&s;e in a wealthy &s;on to &s;ettle a paltry fifty pound for life on a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and worthy father; but an action of little or no merit in a father to &s;ettle twenty times the &s;um upon an indigent &s;on.

<P>AN eminent merchant, who&s;e name I think ne|ce&s;&s;ary to conceal under that of Webley, married a mo&s;t amiable woman, with whom he received a con&s;iderable fortune, and by whom he was ble&s;t in the fir&s;t year with a daughter, called Maria: Mrs. Webley however unhappily catching a cold during the time of her lying-in, did not long &s;urvive the birth of her child, but died in about three months after; with her la&s;t breath conjuring her hu&s;band to be particularly attentive to the welfare of the unfortunate little Maria.</P>
<P>MR. WEBLEY for two years before his marriage had been connected with a &s;ubtle de&s;igning woman, by whom he al&s;o had a daughter, nor did his having a wife put an end to the guilty intercour&s;e: under pretence of important bu&s;ine&s;s, he fre|quently &s;taid in town with her a night or two in the week, while Mrs. Webley was down at the country hou&s;e in Hertford&s;hire; and as frequently carried her into the country with him, whenever he knew his lady could not conveniently leave town: &mdash; His marriage, in fact, was rather an engage|ment of intere&s;t, than a union of inclination; and Mrs. Webley's fortune enabling him to live up to the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes, the moment &s;he was in|terred, he thought there was no farther nece&s;&s;ity for re&s;traint or di&s;gui&s;e. &mdash; In &s;hort, &s;ix weeks had &s;carcely elap&s;ed, when he married the abandoned
<PB N="138" REF="153">
woman we have been &s;peaking of, and pitched upon the mo&s;t profligate of her &s;ex, to &s;upply the place of the very be&s;t.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall pa&s;s over the time of Maria's infancy, when &s;he experienced little more than the dimini|tive cruelty of a narrow-minded mother in-law, and come at once to that period, which may be ju&s;tly reckoned the mo&s;t important of her life: &s;he had ju&s;t entered on her eighteenth year, and was blooming into all the perfections of her &s;ex, when Mrs. Webley began to think of executing a &s;cheme which &s;he had long in agitation. &mdash; She &s;aw Maria treated by every body with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and beheld her own daughter, though dre&s;t out in all the fa&s;hionable foppery of the times, and infinitely more attended to, received with a degree of in&s;ipid civility, that bordered upon contempt. &mdash; The &s;hameful neglect which Maria experienced at home, gave a con&s;tant lu&s;tre to her merit when abroad, and if &s;he found no kind of countenance in her own family, &s;he met with the highe&s;t in every other place. &mdash; This was a circum&s;tance which galled Mrs. Webley to the very &s;oul, and being more over fearful that the regard &s;o univer&s;ally &s;hewn to Maria, would be a means of ob&s;tructing any favourable addre&s;&s;es which might be made to her own daughter, &s;he took a &s;peedy opportunity of quarrelling with that unhappy young lady, and being, as the generality of tho&s;e of her principles mo&s;t commonly are, both ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, very fairly turned her out of doors,
<PB N="139" REF="154">
&mdash; Maria was not however de&s;titute of a protector, though &s;he had lo&s;t a father. &mdash; A young fellow, with a good under&s;tanding and a &s;plendid e&s;tate, who had long &s;olicited her favourable opinion, and gained it, took that opportunity of pre&s;&s;ing for her hand, and was made the happie&s;t of men.</P>
<P>MARIA was married about five years, during which time, though &s;he had often entreated for a reconciliation, &s;he never could be admitted to the pre&s;ence of her father; when, taking up the Ga|zette, one Saturday evening, &s;he met with his name among&s;t the li&s;t of bankrupts, and in&s;tantly fainted on the floor: &s;he was however &s;oon brought to her&s;elf, when, forgetting in a moment how &s;he had been turned out upon the charity of an in|ho&s;pitable world, and expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t pinching poverty and di&s;grace; how for a &s;eries of years &s;he had been treated as an alien to her father's family, and even denied the mo&s;t trivial nece&s;&s;aries, while &s;trangers were riotting on her mother's for|tune; &s;he flew to her hu&s;band, who&s;e happine&s;s was centred in obliging her, and painting out the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of her father, obtained his con|&s;ent to &s;ettle three hundred a year out of a &s;um which he would allow her for pin money on him, to alle|viate &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing an incident: with this &s;he imme|diately took coach, and proceeded to her father's; the door was now thrown open at her approach; and being introduced to the old gentleman's pre|&s;ence, they gazed upon one another for &s;ome mo|ments, and then bur&s;t into a mutual flood of tears.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="155">MR. WEBLEY'S misfortunes had opened his eyes to the &s;trangene&s;s of his conduct, and nobody could be more ready to condemn it than h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;elf. What then mu&s;t we judge his emotions to be, when a daughter, whom he had left de&s;titute of bread, came to offer him a genteel allowance for life; and the &s;ame eyes which he had &s;teeped in tears of the keene&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, came to fill his with drops of unutterable joy; his gratitude as a man, his feelings as a father, in&s;tantly ru&s;hed upon his &s;oul; he dried his eyes, looked full in his daugh|ter's face for &s;ome moments, then capering about the room with the phrenzy of a bedlamite, bur&s;t afre&s;h into tears. Suffice it, however, that after his affairs were &s;ettled, he retired into the country, upon this yearly allowance, but did not live long enough to enjoy the fir&s;t quarter: the mortification of being a bankrupt, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his family errors, and finally, the very genero&s;ity of his daughter, which was intended to &s;weeten the re|mainder of his life, proved a means of hurrying him to his end: the agitation of his mind threw the gout in his &s;tomach, and he died in Maria's arms, in the fiftieth year of his age. His wife and daughter now thought them&s;elves utterly undone; but Maria, with a greatne&s;s of mind peculiar to her&s;elf, in an in&s;tant di&s;pelled their apprehen&s;ions by a continuation of two hundred a year, during her life, and without ever &s;tooping to hint any thing of their former behaviour, told them, that

they mu&s;t con&s;ider it as no compliment, &s;ince &s;he looked upon it as an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, which &s;he ought to pay to the memory of her father.</P>

<P>HAVING thus di&s;covered the occa&s;ion of Mr. Highmore's indifference, I re&s;olved to render my|&s;elf as worthy of his attention as I could, by con|ver&s;ing on the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects I was able: for this purpo&s;e I would occa&s;ionly cite a pa&s;&s;age from our celebrated writers, and deliver my opinion on hi&s;torical events, poetical compo&s;ition, and &s;uch other parts of literature as I thought would be mo&s;t agreeable to the temper I &s;aw him in. &mdash; But alas, Sir, in&s;tead of finding his humour abated by this &s;olicitude to plea&s;e, I had the misfortune to &s;ee it vi&s;ibly encrea&s;ed: &mdash; If I quoted a pa&s;&s;age from any author, he &s;miled; &mdash; If I pretended to judge, he tittered &mdash; But if I was in&s;olent enough to differ from the minute&s;t opinion of his, he either flew out of the hou&s;e, or politely laughed in my face. &mdash; Every ca&s;ual impropriety of accent he was &s;ure to ridicule, and tho&s;e little grammatical in|accuracies which women cannot always avoid, were everla&s;ting object of contempt. &mdash; Failing in my endeavours here, I attempted to engage him in a variety of amu&s;ements, but in vain &mdash; If I propo&s;ed the play &mdash; women only diverted his at|tention from the bu&s;ine&s;s of the performance; &mdash; If I propo&s;ed a walk in the park &mdash; women truly were pretty companions to dangle with in public: &mdash; If I mentioned a game at cards, fools only had recour&s;e to diver&s;ions of that kind.&mdash; In &s;hort, Sir, let me &s;tart what I would, either the meanne&s;s of my un|der&s;tanding,
<PB N="144" REF="159">
or the greatne&s;s of his own, was &s;ure of defeating all my views, and nothing was happy enough to merit his approbation but what imme|diately proceeded from him&s;elf. &mdash; For this la&s;t twelvemonth, Sir, Mr. Highmore has commenced <HI>bon vivant</HI> and &s;at till three or four o'clock every morning with a &s;elect party of friends, who are eminent in the world for their literary abilities; as it is a fundamental principle with the&s;e extra|ordinary gentlemen, never to part, while they are able to &s;it together. Irregularity and intemperance have &s;o impaired the con&s;titution of my poor Mr. Highmore, that I am terrified to death at the bare &s;uppo&s;ition of the con&s;equences. &mdash; His employment all day is to recover from the exce&s;&s;es of the pre|ceding evening, and his bu&s;ine&s;s all night to pro|vide an indi&s;po&s;ition for the next day.</P>
<P>FOR God's &s;ake, Mr. Babler, &s;ay &s;omething about tho&s;e men of &s;en&s;e who look upon women to be idiots, and yet are guilty of actions that would make the meane&s;t of us a&s;hamed. &mdash; Is this &s;uperi|ority of under&s;tanding, Sir, upon which the gene|rality of your &s;ex &s;o highly pique them&s;elves, to be pleaded as an eternal excu&s;e for indi&s;cretions and errors, and no allowance to be made for the little failings of the poor women, though we are treated continually as fools?</P>

<P>SINGULARITY is &s;o much the affectation of the pre&s;ent Aera, that there is &s;carely an in|dividual but what &s;trikes out a plan of operation for him&s;elf, and exhibits a particular &s;omething in his character, that marks him in a di&s;tinct manner from every body el&s;e. This endeavour at &s;ingu|larity, let the circum&s;tance be what it will, in which we di&s;play it, is always the re&s;ult of much pride, and little under&s;tanding; it proceeds from a de&s;picable ambition to be talked of, and, like the Ephe&s;ian youth, &s;o we hear our name bandied about from mouth to mouth, it becomes a matter of indifference how we are mentioned, whether for erecting a temple to the Deity, or for &s;etting one in flames.</P>
<P>AMONG many in&s;tances which I have remarked of &s;ubaltern &s;ingularity in the cour&s;e of my own acquaintance, the foundation of poor Ned Totter's fame is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary. Ned, for the&s;e la&s;t twenty years, has not touched a mor&s;el of butcher's meat, his diet con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of fi&s;h, fowl, and vegetables, and this bare circum|&s;tance has been a con&s;tant &s;ource of &s;elf-exultation ever &s;ince: when he comes into company he
<PB N="146" REF="161">
watches for every opportunity of relating this me|ritorious acts of ab&s;tinence, and is particularly plea&s;ed if any &s;trangers happen to be pre&s;ent to ble&s;s him with a &s;tare of a&s;toni&s;hment, which he looks upon as the highe&s;t indication of applau&s;e. I have frequently known him run about from coffee-hou&s;e to coffee-hou&s;e, in order to meet with a fre&s;h admirer, and engage a whole table of politicians with a di&s;cour&s;e upon the pecullarities of all the crowned heads in Europe, that he might turn the conver&s;ation of his auditory at la&s;t upon the &s;trange|ne&s;s of his own. A very &s;en&s;ible young fellow, who has &s;tudied his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, takes every occa&s;ion of indulging it, and leads him with a preparatory di&s;cour&s;e to a con&s;tant mention of his favourite &s;ubject; this has made the young fellow &s;o extremely agreeable to my old friend, that upon a fit of illne&s;s &s;ometime ago, he &s;et him down very hand&s;omely in his will, and appointed him one of his executors. Various are the circum&s;tances I could tell of this affected &s;ingularity. &mdash; Tom Steady has made it a point every day &s;ince the la&s;t rebellion, to take a view of Temple-bar, and in|dulge him&s;elf with a &s;ight of the heads. This ex|traordinary mark of his affection for the govern|ment, has an&s;wered his wi&s;hes; it has been talked of a thou&s;and times among his acquaintance, and Tom is at once the true&s;t &s;ubject, and the happie&s;t man, in the kingdom. &mdash; Frank Loiter has rendered him&s;elf immortal for lounging about We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall during term time. &mdash; Will Carele&s;s is univer|&s;ally
<PB N="147" REF="162">
celebrated for having his &s;tockings hanging continually about his heels; and my ingenious friend, Mr. Thomas Clough, of Drury-lane Theatre, is talked of by all the world for never mi&s;&s;ing an execution at Tyburn.</P>
<P>BUT if &s;ingularity in trivial occurrences is &s;o cer|tain of making us ridiculous, an affection of par|ticular vices, through a de&s;ire of appearing &s;ingular, cannot &s;urely &s;ail of rendering us odious, as well as de&s;picable in the eyes of the world, and occa&s;ion every rational per&s;on to view us with abhorrence, as well as contempt; yet notwith&s;tanding the con&s;equences are &s;o evident and po&s;itive, what numbers do we not continually ob&s;erve e&s;tabli&s;hing their character upon a foundation like this? What myriads does not every day's experience point out, who are am|bitious to be thought ra&s;cals as well as fools, and &s;eek the public admiration in &s;ome &s;ingularity of behaviour for which they ought to be hanged?</P>
<P>OF this number is that celebrated libertine, Sir Charles Riot. Sir Charles is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a hand|&s;ome figure, an exten&s;ive under&s;tanding, and a plentiful e&s;tate; yet, with all the&s;e advantages to gain an hone&s;t reputation, his whole &s;tudy is to ac|quire a character from the de&s;truction of every fa|mily he is admitted in; and his only ambition to become con&s;picuous from the number and black|ne&s;s of his crimes. In one hou&s;e he has ruined two &s;i&s;ters, the daughters of a mo&s;t intimate friend: In another he has debauched the wife of a man, to whom he is indebted for no le&s;s than his life.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="163">THE actions are univer&s;ally &s;poken of, but &s;o far from being a&s;hamed, our hopeful baronet thinks the mention of them a compliment to his per&s;onal qualifications, and always makes gallantry the &s;ubject of his conver&s;ation, that &s;omebody may take notice of the laurels he has won in that ex|ten&s;ive field of real infamy, and imaginary ap|plau&s;e.</P>
<P>SINGULARITY, Mr. Babler, unfortunate for us, is to be met with in every thing but the virtues, and the&s;e being &s;o very rare to be met with them|&s;elves, to talk of it further than as it concerns our follies and our vices, would be unnece&s;&s;ary; for which rea&s;on I &s;hall drop the &s;ubject here, and &s;tile my&s;elf,</P>

<P>YOU &s;eem a friendly good-natured &s;ort of a man, and I have often heard my grand&s;on repeat, with a great deal of &s;atisfaction, many pretty things out of your writings; and Tom, though I &s;ay it, is a very &s;en&s;ible lad, has been three years at a latin &s;chool, and is moreover as dutiful a child as any in England; but to the purpo&s;e:</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="164">YOU mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, I am and have been a long time offended with the cu&s;tom of keep|ing holidays at particular fe&s;tivals, becau&s;e it is productive of many evils, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly do any good &mdash; It is merely an encouragement to the vicious and the profligate, in&s;tead of exciting any principle of morality or religion; and perhaps it would not be going too far, if I a&s;&s;erted that there are more enormities committed at Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and Whit&s;untide, than can be expiated by the virtues of the whole year be&s;ides &mdash; I am led to this &s;ubject from &s;ome dome&s;tic occurrences, dur|ing the cour&s;e of the two holidays, in the Whit|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">-week with which, &s;ince I have taken the liberty for troubling you, I &s;hall endeavour to make amends for tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the patience of your readers.</P>
<P>BREAKFAST was no &s;ooner over Whit-Monday, than my maid Hannah came up &s;tairs and begged leave to pa&s;s the remainder of the day with &s;ome relations of her's, who had made a party for Fulham. &mdash; As the girl was a very good &s;ervant, I not only granted the reque&s;t, but made her a pre|&s;ent of half a crown towards defraying the ex|pences of the excur&s;ion &mdash; &s;he thanked me, pro|mi&s;ed to return early in the evening, and &s;et out.&mdash; About nine o'clock I expexted her home, but no Hannah came Mr. Babler &mdash; Ten &s;truck, and &s;till there was no &s;ign of her appearance &mdash; Eleven &s;truck, but no Hannah, Sir; I can't &s;ay but I was terrified, lea&s;t &s;ome accident &s;hould have happened

to the poor girl, and therefore &s;ent my Tom with the other maid Nanny, to her &s;i&s;ter's, a di&s;creet, &s;ober, &s;ort of a young woman, who keeps a chand|ler's &s;hop within two or three &s;treets: all that this produced was new unea&s;ine&s;s &mdash; the &s;i&s;ter knew nothing of her; heard of no party &s;he was engaged in, and &s;eemed to be frighted out of her wits. &mdash; On this report, I went to bed, but de&s;ired Nanny to wait up till twelve o'clock: &s;he did, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o no purpo&s;e &mdash; Hannah never came near the hou&s;e &s;ince Sir; and we have lately di&s;covered, that &s;he went out with a footman belonging to an officer, that day in&s;tead of going with any relations; that &s;he dined with this &s;orry fellow at Chel&s;ea, where, after dinner, he per&s;uaded her to drink a gla&s;s or two of punoh, which had &s;uch an effect upon her, being utterly unu&s;ed to &s;trong liquors, as rendered it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her to be put to bed. No doubt, the whole was a de&s;ign of the artful villain's; for &s;he was no &s;ooner under the blankets than he &s;tept without any ceremony into bed too; and de&s;troyed in one moment that repu|tation which the unhappy creature had pre&s;erved un&s;u&s;pected for a whole life: when &s;he had re|covered the u&s;e of her rea&s;on, &s;hame and di&s;trac|tion prevented her from coming home; and think|ing the wor&s;t that could, had now happened, &s;he retired with her betrayer to a little room in a hedge alehou&s;e, where &s;he continued with him ever &s;ince; refu&s;ing either to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter, or return to her place, though I &s;ent her word I &s;hould take her

back again, if &s;he left the villain, and would give an ab&s;olute promi&s;e never to have any intercour&s;e with him for the future.</P>
<P>SUCH, Mr. Babler, is the con&s;equence of holi|day-making; and now &s;uffer an old woman to make two or three cur&s;ory remarks &mdash; I remember my fir&s;t hu&s;band, and as hone&s;t a man he was as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver broke the world's bread, u&s;ed to &s;ay, poor man! that the church, by the in&s;titution of holidays, perverted its own de&s;ign, and laid in reality a &s;nare to de&s;troy, where it meant to improve, the morals of the people. Indeed, Sir, I am perfectly of opinion with Mr. Robin&s;on; holidays were origi|nally in&s;tituted to in&s;pire a &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of religious duties, and to give tho&s;e a favourable opportunity of pro&s;ecuting their devotions at particular &s;ea&s;ons, who&s;e nece&s;&s;ary avocations might prevent them from &s;o con&s;tant an attendance as they might po&s;&s;i|bly wi&s;h at other times; but let me a&s;k, Sir, if the end of the church is an&s;wered in the lea&s;t? Do our young people go to church on holidays? Alas, Sir, they con&s;ider a holiday as an ab&s;olute exem|tion from every concern of a religious kind; and a &s;ort of licence to indulge every depravity of their &s;entiments! Do our old people go to church on holidays? Very few Sir; they are employed in cards and fe&s;tivity; and &s;o far is the verge of that eternity, upon which they totter, from making any &s;alutary impre&s;&s;ions on their minds, that though I have not mi&s;&s;ed church a &s;ingle day the&s;e thirty years, yet at the three grand fe&s;tivals, I have ob|&s;erved
<PB N="152" REF="167">
it to be wor&s;e attended than at any other &s;ea&s;on in the year; a few &s;uperannuated women, like my&s;elf, have compo&s;ed the whole congregation, and even the clergyman has run over the &s;ervice in &s;uch a prepo&s;terous hurry, that I have often thought he was impatient to mix in the cu&s;tomary riots of his pari&s;honers.</P>
<P>SEEING, therefore, Mr. Babler, that holidays, &s;o far from an&s;wering, rather defeat the purpo&s;es of religion, and knowing al&s;o how de&s;tructive they are to the community, by encouraging a &s;hameful idlene&s;s among all ranks of people, (the lower order particularly, who&s;e families mu&s;t be ma|terial &s;ufferers by the &s;malle&s;t neglect, I think that every con&s;ideration, both divine and human, &s;hould induce us to lay them a&s;ide, &s;ince nothing can be more &s;candalous than to &s;et a &s;ea&s;on apart for the &s;upport both of idlene&s;s and irreligion; and nothing more repugnant to wi&s;dom or virtue, than to &s;anctify, as one may &s;ay, a time for prejudicing the fortunes, and corrupting the morals of the people.</P>

<P>AN exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility, though nothing can be more amiable than a feeling heart, is per|haps one the greate&s;t misfortunes which the human mind can labour under, becau&s;e there is an ever|la&s;ting &s;ource of objects to intere&s;t it's tenderne&s;s, and a con&s;tant round of accidents to work upon it's fears. &mdash; Happily indeed, we are not over&s;tocked with people who po&s;&s;e&s;s this quality to any extra|ordinary degree, but the few who do, might po&s;&s;i|bly for their own &s;akes, as well as the happine&s;s of others, be much better, if they were endued with no &s;en&s;ibility at all.</P>
<P>POOR Tom Frankly, is a &s;triking proof of this ob&s;ervation: at one and twenty he &s;tepped into an e&s;tate of fifteen hundred pounds a year, and was looked upon by every body, as a very promi&s;ing young fellow; before the year was out, however, Tom's exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility made him find out all the nece&s;&s;itous, and whether their poverty was the fault of their ill-fortune, or the con&s;equence of their crimes; whether they were to be pitied or condemned, he was indifferent in his relief: indi|gence was a never-failing recommendation, and the villain profe&s;&s;ed, ta&s;ted equally of his bounty with the worthie&s;t of men: his character once known, the para&s;ite and the gambler were continually at his table, and working on his humanity with uncea&s;ing
<PB N="154" REF="169">
repetitions of penury and want: fraud was per|petually pe&s;tering him with letters of &s;upplication, and the loo&s;e&s;t pro&s;titutes of the town, teazed his ears forever with imaginary amendments and artificial di&s;tre&s;s; his hand was &s;till open to all, and though his friends very frequently remon&s;trated on the injudicious di&s;tribution of his fortune, his an|&s;wer was eternally, that he could not bear to &s;ee any bo&s;om &s;welled with affliction, nor any eye reddening with wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair: in le&s;s than ten years however, his e&s;tate was reduced to a fifteenth part of its worth; the great decay of his own cir|cum&s;tances, now obliged him to be le&s;s attentive to the affairs of other people, and &s;eeing that nothing but beggary was before him if he went on much farther, he bound him&s;elf under a large penalty never to give away above a tenth part of the pitiful little hundred a year which was left: this he con|&s;tantly di&s;po&s;es of in halfpence and pence to the common beggars, and the moment it is expended, locks him&s;elf up in his room, to avoid both the &s;ight and the importunity of the&s;e vagrant mendi|cants, till the receipt of his next year's &s;upply.</P>
<P>LADY Catherine Nettleworth, is another in|&s;tance of exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibily, but it is however, en|tirely confined to her children, and her lap-dogs; if one of the young gentlemen goes abroad, &s;he is under the mo&s;t violent agitation, le&s;t &s;ome accident &s;hould happen in the &s;horte&s;t excur&s;ion; if he goes in the coach, &s;he is in a continual unea&s;ne&s;s, for fear it &s;hould over&s;et; if he rides, her apprehen&s;ion
<PB N="155" REF="170">
is equally alive, le&s;t the hor&s;e &s;hould unhappily take fright; if he walks, &s;he dreads the con&s;equence of the fatigue, and let the day be either wet or dry, &s;he trembles alike with a terror of his catching cold, or being parched to death with the &s;un: in order to quiet her&s;elf in all the&s;e different re&s;pects, &s;he &s;ometimes keeps the young gentlemen within doors for a whole week; but then &s;he is mi&s;erable in the other extreme; &s;he &s;ickens, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;uffer for want of exerci&s;e, and dies, for fear they &s;hould be &s;tifled for want of air; at table, if they eat hearty, &s;he dreads their being &s;urfeited, and is wretched from a &s;uppo&s;ition of being indi&s;|po&s;ed, if they do not: in fact, whatever they do &s;he &s;eldom has a moment's peace for thinking about their welfare; and wherever &s;he goes, rarely &s;uffers any body el&s;e to enjoy a moment's &s;atis|faction for talking about their various accompli&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>HER concern for her lap-dogs is no le&s;s remark|able than her &s;olicitude about her children; if the maid neglects to comb them twice a day, &s;he flies into the vapours; or &s;uffers them to go into a damp room, &s;he falls into fits; in &s;hort, there is &s;carcely a circum&s;tance in which her &s;en&s;ibility is not creat|ing her a new &s;ource of di&s;quiets, nor a friend in the world whom &s;he does not render unhappy with her endle&s;s apprehen&s;ions and complaints. Upon the whole, I may with certainty enough conclude this paper as I &s;et out, with affirming, that an ex|ce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility (amiable &s;oever as it is to have a

<P>WHEN I fir&s;t commenced an humble &s;ervant of my adorable's, I thought it abundantly &s;ufficient to propo&s;e a walk in the Park, or a di&s;h of tea at the White-Conduit-Hou&s;e, and imagined a prudent con&s;ideration for the main chance, would recom|mend me to her good opinion, e&s;pecially as &s;he had but a very &s;mall fortune of her own, and knew upon that account, the nece&s;&s;ity there was for a little oeconomy. &mdash; But, lack-a-day, Sir, the White-Conduit-Hou&s;e was re&s;orted by nothing but Barbers' boys, or Mantuamakers' apprentices; and for a walk in the Park, &s;he never could be able to crawl &s;o far &mdash; &s;he hated draggling through the &s;treets, and could not bear to be to&s;t about at the di&s;cretion of every clum&s;y porter, or odious Iri&s;h chairman. &mdash; This was a broad hint; and therefore hoping to bring her to an immediate compliance by the appearance of genero&s;ity, I gave into her hu|mour, and coached it about &s;o uncea&s;ingly, that &s;he now looks upon it as an indi&s;pen&s;ible compliment which I am obliged to pay, and never &s;tirs without a carriage out of doors. &mdash; This is not all, Mr. Babler; &s;he has lately got a knack of &s;topping at gold&s;miths &s;hops, and at milliners of her acquaint|ance &mdash; there &s;he has fallen in love with a variety of little knick-knacks, which, like a blockhead, I
<PB N="158" REF="173">
have fooli&s;hly complimented her with, and no later than la&s;t week, Sir, it co&s;t me &s;ixteen guineas for a diamond hoop ring, and five for &s;ome little paltry article in her head dre&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE expences, and the uncertainty I am in with re&s;pect to her inclinations, have made me very &s;erious, Sir; for though I love her with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, and would marry her to-morrow, without a &s;ix-pence, &s;till I mu&s;t have &s;ome regard for my&s;elf too, and prevent in time the de&s;truction of my little fortune, and the laughter of the world into the bargain. I have therefore taken the liberty, Sir, of troubling you with a few que&s;tions, by the advice of my friend Tom Watkin&s;on, as he con|&s;tantly takes in your entertaining paper, and &s;peaks in the hand&s;ome&s;t manner of your good-nature and abilities.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM an unhappy poor ra&s;cal, and have, to my un&s;peakable mortification, been married the&s;e
<PB N="160" REF="175">
three years, to a woman of extraordinary piety and virtue. &mdash; Don't be &s;urpri&s;ed &mdash; I am neither angry with her piety, nor offended with her virtue; on the contrary, I revere her for both the qualifica|tions; but they are attended with con&s;equences &s;o vary di&s;agreeable, that I frequently wi&s;h, when provoked beyond all bounds, that &s;he had been in|debted to Billing&s;gate or Bow-&s;treet for the rudi|ments of her education.</P>
<P>I AM, you mu&s;t know, Sir, a Haberda&s;her, ju&s;t &s;et up at the polite end of the town, where with a little indu&s;try, I have a very rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of making a pretty tolerable fortune. &mdash; I am very a&s;&s;iduous in bu&s;ine&s;s my&s;elf, and wi&s;h I could &s;ay as much for my wife. &mdash; But lackaday, in&s;tead of minding the duties of the &s;hop when I am trotting up and down with a parcel of goods, her lady&s;hip runs out to her devotions, to &s;ome neighbouring church or chapel, and tru&s;ts the care of every thing to an ignorant apprentice, or a giddy headed journey woman. What is wor&s;e, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, Sir, her &s;anctity renders her commonly as cro&s;s as the very devil, and if I &s;ay a &s;ingle &s;yllable, I am &s;ure to hear a volley of charitable ejaculations for the welfare of my poor &s;oul, and to be treated the remainder of the whole day like a downright re|probate.</P>
<P>YOU would imagine however, Sir, that when &s;he does come home, &s;he might be kind enough to favour me with a little of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to ca&s;t an eye over the regulation of my family. &mdash;
<PB N="161" REF="176">
Far different is the ca&s;e; the moment &s;he comes in, &s;he retires to her room, and there wa&s;tes away the time till dinner, over &s;ome &s;tupid compilation of enthu&s;ia&s;tic prayers, or &s;ome ignorant rhap&s;ody made u&s;e of at her conventicles; there profoundly wrapt in dirt and meditation, &s;he imagines her&s;elf di&s;charging the great employment of her life, and never ca&s;ts a &s;ingle thought upon the mi&s;erable poor dog her hu&s;band, or the unhappy little wretches her children.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;poke of her, Mr. Babler, as being wrapt up in dirt and meditation. &mdash; I &s;aid no more than the truth; for the filthine&s;s of her per&s;on is equal to the piety of her &s;entiments. &mdash; Looking down with di&s;dain upon every &s;ublunary enjoyment, &s;he thinks it beneath her to pay the lea&s;t attention to her dre&s;s, and upon this decent principle it is, that hardly once in three months &s;he puts on either a clean cap, or a light-coloured apron. &mdash; A ru&s;ty old cardinal &s;erves her for a cover&s;lut, as often as &s;he goes out; and as for her appearance at home, &s;he kindly imagines that any thing is good enough to wear before her hu&s;band; nay, Sir, &s;ometimes &s;he won't wa&s;h her hands or face in a whole fort|night, and you &s;hall judge what a condition her arms were in upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, when a &s;urgeon in the neighbourhood who came to bleed her, mi&s;took the dirt for an antiquated kid&s;kin, and de&s;ired &s;he would take off her gloves.</P>
<P>FROM the preceding little &s;ketch of my amiable helpmate, Mr. Babler, you mu&s;t judge that her
<PB N="162" REF="177">
conduct has as great an effect upon my mind as an impre&s;&s;ion on my circum&s;tances, and con&s;e|quently that I am never ea&s;y without being abroad, though I know the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for my attend|ance at home upon bu&s;ine&s;s. &mdash; I am cut off in my own hou&s;e from every little comfort of &s;ociety, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t have an inclination of &s;eeking it &s;omewhere el&s;e. &mdash; I cannot a&s;k a friend to break|fa&s;t, dine, or &s;up with me. My own &s;tomach is con&s;tantly turned when I &s;it down to table, and that I think abundantly &s;ufficient, without &s;triving to di&s;gu&s;t my acquaintance. &mdash; Be&s;ides, from an ut|ter neglect of the mo&s;t dome&s;tic concern, let me &s;ay what I will, I can never get a joint of meat properly dre&s;&s;ed, but have it brought up without being heated half through, or el&s;e intirely done to rags.</P>
<P>THUS &s;ituated, as I &s;aid before, I take every op|portunity of going abroad, and this opens a fre&s;h &s;ource of inconvenience and anxiety. &mdash; My wife, to crown my misfortunes, is uncommonly fond of me, and if I either dine or &s;up from home, is &s;ure of being con&s;tantly in tears. &mdash; Yet, Sir, this home &s;he makes intolerable, for even after &s;hop hours, if I oblige her by &s;taying within, I meet fre&s;h in|&s;tances of mortification. &mdash; Mirth and good humour are bani&s;hed from my doors; a harmle&s;s joke is con&s;idered as a &s;inful levity, and an innocent laugh, prohibited as wholly antichri&s;tian. The ca&s;e is not mended neither, if in conformity to her humour, I wear a grave a&s;pect; for then, Sir, &s;he either
<PB N="163" REF="178">
teazes me to death with unnece&s;&s;ary apprehen&s;ions about my health, or reproaches me with being ill|natured, becau&s;e I am confined to her company. Any way &s;he is &s;ure of finding fault, and any way I am equally certain of being rendered mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Is there no means, Mr. Babler, of curing this un|accountable malady of being righteous overmuch? Is there no means of convincing the&s;e narrow minded women, that a moro&s;ene&s;s of temper, or a di&s;regard of rational enjoyments, are in no manner encou|raged by the &s;entiments of religion; but that on the contrary, a &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and an en|deavour to di&s;charge the nece&s;&s;ary duties of wife and mother, are particularly &s;ome of it's mo&s;t beautiful characteri&s;tics. &mdash; I do not think this &s;ubject would be unworthy the pen of our mo&s;t eminent divines. &mdash; Suffer me, through your paper, to beg &s;ome of them will con&s;ider it, &s;ince it is more likely that a le&s;&s;on on this matter will come with more weight from the pulpit than any other quarter.</P>

<P>THE impre&s;&s;ions which are made upon the human mind, during its earlie&s;t &s;tates, being &s;eldom if ever to be entirely eradicated, there is nothing in which we ought to be more careful
<PB N="164" REF="179">
than the education of our children, particularly in their infancy, when habits in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term, become an ab&s;olute part of our nature, and prejudices not only find a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uge in the heart; but twi&s;t them&s;elves imperceptibly round it's very &s;trings.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER when I was about four or five years of age, my grandmother took me entirely under her own care, and as the good woman, like the generality of her &s;ex at that period, had a firm be|lief in witches, &s;pirits, and hobgobblins, &s;he fre|quently entertained me with a variety of their pretty performances, and if I happened to be any ways untoward, con&s;tantly threatened to &s;end me to Robin Greenway &mdash; This Mr. Robin Greenway was formerly a journeyman taylor in the neigh|bourhood, who had gone di&s;tracted for love, as the people &s;aid, and in one of his de&s;perate fits, cut his throat in the par&s;on's garden. &mdash; Various were the tricks related of this unhappy enamorato; &s;ometimes he came in a &s;torm, and threw a parcel of bricks down his &s;weetheart's chimney; at other times he a&s;&s;umed the figure of a grey mare; and at others, that of a &s;potted &s;paniel, but his mo&s;t favourite mode of appearance, was the form of an overgrown calf. &mdash; Ridiculous as the&s;e accounts mu&s;t have been inevitably con&s;idered on the &s;malle&s;t reflexion, yet my poor grandmother believed them all with the mo&s;t religious certainty, and thought it an indi&s;pen&s;ible part of her duty to make me be|lieve them too. &mdash; In this &s;he &s;ucceeded to the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="180">
mo&s;t of her wi&s;hes; I was ten years old before I would venture to &s;leep alone; fourteen, before I had courage enough to go to bed in the dark, and to this very hour, if I happen to be by my&s;elf, the clock never &s;trikes twelve at night, but I think of Robin Greenway, or &s;ome other wor&s;hipful mem|ber of the &s;ame community, to whom the ble&s;&s;ing of an untimely death has granted a privilege of taking what form, and playing what tricks, he plea&s;es till the cock crows next morning.</P>
<P>IT would be unnece&s;&s;ary for me to ob&s;erve, that nine out of every ten, who may be turned of fifty, have, like my&s;elf, in their infancy, been trained up in the greate&s;t dread of &s;pirits; and that the utmo&s;t exertion of their rea&s;on upon arriving at years of maturity, has not been &s;ufficient to era&s;e the im|pre&s;&s;ions which have then been unhappily made upon their imagination. &mdash; Fortunately however, the good &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ent Era has provided the mo&s;t effectual &s;pells for our gho&s;ts and &s;pectres, and laid &s;o many of them &s;ucce&s;sfully in the red &s;ea, that harmle&s;s little boys may for the future &s;leep in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity, and the hone&s;t country people traver&s;e the remote&s;t church yard after midnight, without the &s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding we have in a great mea&s;ure got the better of our gho&s;ts, there are yet &s;ome prejudices, and tho&s;e of a very dangerous tendency, which we have in a manner &s;ub&s;tituted in their room, and which it would be much to our honour in this life, and to our happine&s;s in the next, if we
<PB N="166" REF="181">
could get the better of too. &mdash; The&s;e are the &s;hame|ful indulgencies to which we think our&s;elves enti|tled on Sundays. &mdash; In the days of &s;pectres and hobgobblins, we thought our&s;elves under an in|di&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of paying &s;ome regard to the &s;abbath, and every man was obliged to pay a fine who omitted going to church that day, unle&s;s he could palliate his conduct by &s;ome very fea&s;ible ex|cu&s;e; but now-a-days, Sunday is the time particu|larly &s;et apart for riot and fe&s;tivity, and the day rendered holy by the expre&s;s appointment of Om|nipotence, the day peculiarly appropriated for the greate&s;t violation of it's laws. &mdash; Has a great man a journey to make, or a company to invite, Sunday is an idle day, and he &s;ixes either upon that. &mdash; Has a woman of fa&s;hion an inclination to &s;trip her be&s;t friends of the money which ought to pay a trade&s;man's bill, &s;he &s;ends cards for Sunday evening. &mdash; And has a petty little mechanic a mind to cut a figure, why he hires his hor&s;e, takes out his &s;trumpet, and gets drunk on Sunday evening too.</P>
<P>IN the inferior orders of life, there is a notion generally prevalent, that cards are very mon&s;trous on a Sunday, and there are many well-meaning people who would not upon any con&s;ideration &s;it down to a party of whi&s;t. &mdash; None of my readers will imagine, I dare &s;ay, that I want from this to extenuate the infamous cu&s;tom of card-playing on the &s;abbath of God. &mdash; All that I want is, to &s;hew the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people, that leaping in the fields, playing at cricket, riding hor&s;e matches
<PB N="167" REF="182">
on the roads, and getting drunk on that day, is every whit as criminal as the propen&s;ity to cards, which they &s;o highly cen&s;ure in their &s;uperiors; that any of tho&s;e exerci&s;es which they think allow|able, is rather more indecent, becau&s;e more pub|licly practi&s;ed, and may in reality be attended with infinitely wor&s;e effects. &mdash; Let them therefore (if it be in vain to preach to the politer world) fir&s;t of all reform in the&s;e points of behaviour on Sundays, them&s;elves, before they pretend to ar|raign the conduct of the great; and in&s;tead of di&s;|covering the mote in the eye of their neighbour, &s;it attentively down to pluck the beam out of their own.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN what manner to tell you my unfortunate &s;tory I know not; &s;hame and confu&s;ion forbid me to
<PB N="168" REF="183">
whi&s;per it to the very winds, but a ju&s;t concern for the happine&s;s of others, has worked upon my hu|manity, and wrings the melancholy &s;ecret from my heart. &mdash; You mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, I am a woman of &s;ome birth, had once a little beauty, and what was infinitely more important in the eye of the world, a very affluent fortune. At the age of twenty-one I married the mo&s;t amiable of men, with whom I lived in an uninterrupted round of felicity for &s;ix and thirty years: during that period we had four &s;ons and three daughters, who are all provided for, both &s;plendidly and fortunate|ly, in the world, and enjoy the fulle&s;t &s;weets of opulence in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t perfect content.</P>
<P>ABOUT nine months ago, Sir, &mdash; O! that I had not &s;urvived to recollect a time that now brings Ba&s;ili&s;ks to my imagination, and murders the mo&s;t di&s;tant beam of comfort with a glance; &mdash; the man with whom I had lived &s;o happily and &s;o long, fell ill of a fever, and died in ten days. My di&s;traction at his lo&s;s was inexpre&s;&s;ible, yet when my future conduct comes to be mentioned, I &s;hall be &s;u&s;|pected of di&s;ingenuity, if I &s;ay I was concerned at it at all; but believe me, I felt every thing a woman endued with a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility could po&s;|&s;ibly experience on &s;o tender and afflicting an oc|ca&s;ion, and was reduced &s;o low by the conflict which my mind had undergone, that when the phy&s;i|cians pre&s;cribed the Bath waters, it was univer&s;ally thought I &s;hould not hold out to the journey's end.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="184">PROVIDENCE, however, which de&s;igned that I &s;hould &s;tand a warning to my &s;ex, to the &s;urprize of my whole family, worked a miracle almo&s;t in favour of my health, and in about three months I was &s;o perfectly recovered that I came up to town, and &s;eemed not only to have left every trace of my indi&s;po&s;ition behind, but the principal marks of my age too; in &s;hort, every body complimented me on the life of my looks, and raked the latent embers of vanity, which had a long, long time lain &s;mothered in my heart, with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s toge|ther, that upon a &s;ecret con&s;ultation with my own wi&s;hes, I could not ab&s;olutely conclude but I might be yet prevailed upon to change my condition, and make a &s;econd venture on the &s;mooth ocean of that &s;tate which rendered my life &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing in the fir&s;t. &mdash; The moment a thought of this nature comes into the brea&s;t of an old woman, it clings like Cleopatra's a&s;ps, and mo&s;t commonly &s;tings her to death. &mdash; For my own part, Sir, though I felt a &s;ecret repugnance at the notion of another hu&s;band, yet the idea &s;tuck clo&s;e to my imagination, and I even &s;ometimes endeavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf that this hone&s;t aver&s;ion, which in &s;pite of me, my con|&s;cience would retain, was nothing but a prejudice of education or cu&s;tom, which it was highly meri|torious to &s;ubdue. My memory was ran&s;acked for in&s;tances where women in my circum&s;tances had married a &s;econd time, with hand&s;ome young fel|lows too, yet lived extremely happy, notwith&s;tand|ing the vulgar and abominable &s;uppo&s;ition, that no|body
<PB N="170" REF="185">
body could entertain a pa&s;&s;ion for a woman in years: nay, Mr. Babler, I found texts of &s;cripture in &s;upport of my favourite opinion, and ab&s;olutely forced my&s;elf to believe that I was obliged by the very principles of religion to make another choice.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus debating, Sir, my &s;on Edward, who is a colonel in the army, brought a young fellow of his acquaintance to &s;up at my hou&s;e. &mdash; I do not know how it was, but I fancied he was the mo&s;t hand&s;ome man I had ever &s;een in my life; his conver&s;ation too was &s;o elegant, and he paid &s;o profound a deference to my opinion, that I did not &s;leep, &mdash; &s;hame upon my antiquated eyelids, &mdash; a &s;ingle wink the whole night. What need I tre&s;pa&s;s on your patience, major Ravage repeated his vi&s;its, began to find he was far from di&s;agreeable, and in &s;hort made an offer of his hand in &s;uch terms as I was wholly unable to re&s;i&s;t. Without ever enquir|ing into his character or his circum&s;tances, I con|&s;ented to be his at an age that would become me to wait upon my grand-children, and flattered my|&s;elf that his affection might be engaged to my per|&s;on, at the very moment I knew it to be entirely created by my pur&s;e. My poor fir&s;t hu&s;band ima|gining that as I had been a faithful wife to him, I &s;hould be a tender mother to his children, left me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fifty thou&s;and pounds, and a jointure of three thou&s;and a year, every &s;ixpence of which, as far as I could, I neverthele&s;s unnaturally &s;ettled on the villain who had taken the advantage of my
<PB N="171" REF="186">
&s;econd childhood, the morning after the celebration of our nuptials.</P>
<P>MY children you may be &s;ure would be ju&s;tly offended at this prepo&s;terous match, and they were; but to be rid of upbraidings, &mdash; which cut me to the &s;oul, &mdash; I quarrelled with them in turn, and forbad them ever to enter into my &s;ight: but alas! I had too &s;oon an occa&s;ion for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and relief. A fortnight had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed, when major Ravage, without &s;aying a &s;ingle &s;yllable, &s;et off for Bath with a trade&s;man's wife in the city, and about an hour after his departure, an uphol|&s;terer came in, demanding the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my hou&s;e and goods, having bought every thing that morning from my hu&s;band. &mdash; I will not attempt to paint my a&s;toni&s;hment, my fury, and my di&s;tre&s;s: it was too much for nature to &s;upport, and I fell lifele&s;s on the floor. &mdash; Not to tire your patience, Sir, &mdash; upon examining into every thing, and &s;end|ing to the major, he flatly refu&s;ed either to &s;end me a &s;hilling, or ever to cohabit again with &s;o &s;tale a parcel of mortality,&mdash;that was his decent expre&s;&s;ion. In this &s;ituation my elde&s;t daughter came and con|duced me to her hou&s;e, generou&s;ly &s;oothing me in the tendere&s;t manner, but wounding me however a thou&s;and times more by her goodne&s;s than &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly do by &s;eizing the opportunity to load me with complaints. I am now going to &s;ue for a &s;eparate maintenance, and &s;hall convince the grey-headed &s;ucklings of my &s;ex, that an old woman, who marries a young fellow, if &s;he even &s;hould
<PB N="172" REF="187">
meet with a worthy one, can never expect to be treated with any tenderne&s;s or regard; and that on the other hand, if &s;he con&s;ents to wed a villain, &s;he can look for nothing but an endle&s;s &s;cene of poverty and contempt: where &s;he is mo&s;t fortunate in her choice, neglect and ridicule mu&s;t be her por|tion, and where &s;he happens to be otherwi&s;e, the public &s;corn of the world will be aggravated by a continual round of private wretchedne&s;s and di&s;|tre&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SEEING a variety of letters in your enter|taining paper, from hu&s;bands and wives, I have taken the liberty of adding to the number of your matrimonial corre&s;pondents, and doubt not but if you favour my complaint with a place, but what it will be attended with very &s;alutary effects.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Sir, I am married to one of the mo&s;t agreeable women in England, have an unabating pa&s;&s;ion for my wife, and every rea&s;on to imagine her &s;entiments are equally tender for me; there is nothing of con&s;equence but what we con|tinually &s;tudy to oblige each other in; yet at the
<PB N="173" REF="188">
&s;ame time there are a thou&s;and little trifles in which we are always &s;ure to di&s;agree, and which are not only an endle&s;s &s;ource of di&s;quiet to our&s;elves, but of unea&s;ine&s;s to our whole family.</P>
<P>LAST night, for in&s;tance, Sir, after &s;upper I ac|quainted Nancy that a Vintner, who owed me a hundred pounds for &s;ome Li&s;bons, (for you mu&s;t know I am a wine-merchant, Mr. Babler,) had failed, and that there was but little probability of expecting two and &s;ix-pence from the &s;ale of all his effects. I furthermore informed her, that I was much to blame in the affair, and that I had tru&s;ted this man contrary to the advice of an intimate friend, who was perfectly conver&s;ant with his cir|cum&s;tances. My wife, in&s;tead of reprehending me for indi&s;cretion, as the generality of her &s;ex would have done in the &s;ame ca&s;e, made u&s;e of every argument in her power to di&s;&s;ipate my cha|grin; told me, the mo&s;t careful were unable now and then to avoid an error, and bid me con&s;ole my&s;elf under my lo&s;s, by thanking providence that I had not been a &s;ufferer in double the &s;um. I was greatly charmed with this di&s;po&s;ition in Mrs. Mountain, Sir, and expre&s;&s;ed my &s;en&s;ibility of it in a manner with which &s;he &s;eemed infinitely plea&s;ed. Well, after all this would you imagine, Mr. Babler, that a mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance &s;hould make us part beds for that night. My favourite liquor is a gla&s;s of punch, and it happens to be my wife's too; making a little as we were alone, I unluckily &s;queezed the pulp of the lemon into the bowl,
<PB N="174" REF="189">
upon which &s;he immediately exclaimed with &s;ome warmth, "Lord, my dear, you have &s;poiled the punch,"&mdash;"No, my love, (replied I) the pulp gives it a fine flavour, and be&s;ides you know I am very fond of it,"&mdash;" Ay, but (&s;ays &s;he) you are &s;en&s;ible I can't abide it;"&mdash;"Then, my dear, re|tutned I, it is an ea&s;y matter to avoid putting any in your gla&s;s." &mdash; Lord, Mr. Mountain, I have &s;poke to you a thou&s;and times about this very cir|cum&s;tance; I believe in my con&s;cience you do it on purpo&s;e to give me di&s;gu&s;t."</P>
<P>HERE, Mr. Babler, we began a conte&s;t; &s;everity produced &s;everity, till at la&s;t I ordered a bed to be made for my&s;elf, and poor Nancy retired to her own, with her eyes &s;mimming in tears.</P>
<P>FOR the whole night neither of us (for I judge of her by my&s;elf) had a &s;ingle wink of &s;leep; we tumbled and to&s;&s;ed, canva&s;&s;ed the matter fifty ways in our minds, and at la&s;t concluded, like Lockit and Peachum in the Beggar's Opera, that we were both in the wrong. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, when we met at breakfa&s;t but an hour ago, neither of us would conde&s;cend to &s;peak fir&s;t; we affected a re&s;entment of countenance, that was utterly &s;overeign to our hearts, and endeavoured to keep up the appearance of an unremitting anger, when we both of us longed to be reconciled, and had the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate inclination to be plea&s;ed. Break|fa&s;t was over before we exchanged a &s;yllable, when the &s;ervant had left the room, prepared to go out, and had ju&s;t got to the parlour door, when poor
<PB N="175" REF="190">
Nancy, unable to hold it out any longer, cried in a tone of irre&s;i&s;tible &s;oftne&s;s, "And will you go without &s;peaking a word:" here our whole ridi|culous quarrel was at an end: I turned to her with all the fondne&s;s I could po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume, and held her in my arms for &s;ome moments, while &s;he re|turning the fervor of the embrace, bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>IT is inconceivable to think, Mr. Babler, how contemptible the&s;e little differences have made us in the eyes of our own &s;ervants. Whenever they &s;ee us cool towards one another, they titter and laugh, and &s;ay the poor things will &s;oon ki&s;s and make it up again. It was no later ago than la&s;t week, that I overheard my ra&s;cal of a coachman tell one of his fellow &s;ervants, that his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were nothing better than an overgrown, boy and girl, and that he fancied a little of his, hor&s;ewhip would be of great &s;ervice to both of them. It is very odd, Mr. Babler, that people who really love one another, and are not wholly de&s;titute of under&s;tanding, &s;hould give way to &s;uch re&s;entment in the mere&s;t trifles, who in the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances of life, are above feeling the &s;malle&s;t re&s;entment, or entertaining the minute&s;t di&s;e&s;teem. Many is the time, Sir, I have found fault with my wife for &s;tirring the fire, when her &s;pending five hundred pound has not given me the lea&s;t un|ea&s;ine&s;s; and many a time has &s;he fallen out with me, if in cutting up a fowl I happened to &s;pla&s;h ever &s;o &s;mall a drop of gravy on the table cloth,
<PB N="176" REF="191">
though &s;he has felt no di&s;compo&s;ure in life, if I &s;poiled a rich &s;ilk, or dirtied a fine head-dre&s;s. This morning, however, we have agreed as a means of keeping our&s;elves from <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of this nature for the future, to &s;end you the foregoing account, and if it &s;hould turn out any way &s;erviceable to others, as I hope it will, I &s;hall have a double rea&s;on to &s;ign my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>NUMB. LXII.<HI>Saturday, November</HI> 26.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a very &s;en&s;ible &s;aying among the women, when any of their acquaintance happen to be brought to bed of a boy, and this is "that Mrs. &s;uch-a-one has got one of the right &s;ort." In reality there are &s;o many dangers at|tending the education of a young lady to years of maturity, and there are &s;uch a variety of circum|&s;tances to de&s;troy her reputation, which, through the fa&s;hionable depravity of the times, are con&s;i|dered as &s;o many excellencies in the other &s;ex, that I am no way &s;urprized to find people parti|cularly rejoiced at having "one of the right &s;ort," as it is emphatically expre&s;&s;ed; &s;ince the &s;atisfaction of the parent is con&s;iderably le&s;s expo&s;ed, as well as the happine&s;s of the child; to &s;ay nothing of the infinitely greater ea&s;e with which the infant can be brought up.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="192">WHEN I &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the cu&s;tomary mode of educating the fair <HI>&s;ex,</HI> in&s;tead of being &s;urprized to find &s;o many turn out an affliction to their friends, or a di&s;grace to &s;ociety, I am in fact a&s;toni&s;hed that we do not find a multitude more, Now-a-days, in&s;tead of being attentive to the cultivation of a young lady's mind, our regard is entirely engro&s;&s;ed by the accompli&s;hments of her per&s;on; and the ge|nerality of our mothers are totally unconcerned whether or no their daughters are acquainted with the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary duties of religion, provided they can make a tollerable figure at a party of whi&s;t, and turn out their toes.</P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t moment little mi&s;s is &s;ent to &s;chool, &s;he is provided with a doll, perhaps as large again as her&s;elf; and is in&s;tructed in the nece&s;&s;ary manner of dre&s;&s;ing it properly, and &s;ending it quietly to bed. Thus in the earlie&s;t &s;tage her mind receives a turn for gallantry and dre&s;s, which im|perceptibly &s;trengthens with her years, and being accu&s;tomed to nothing but compliments on her beauty, &s;he becomes utterly indifferent to every|thing el&s;e; the little reading &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of, is rather a prejudice than a benefit, for as it is princi|pally compo&s;ed of novels, it con&s;tantly warms her imagination with &s;entiments of intrigue, and adds to the opinion which &s;he entertained of her own per&s;on and under&s;tanding; hence &s;he fancies her|&s;elf the heroine of every extravagant romance, till at la&s;t, from an admiration of the character, &s;he really takes it up, and runs off, if in high life,
<PB N="178" REF="193">
with &s;ome Amadis of a &s;ubaltern officer; and if in low, with a &s;trolling player or a barber's boy.</P>
<P>THE &s;candalous neglect of female education, may however be put down to the account of the other &s;ex: by a cu&s;tom no le&s;s arbitrary than un|rea&s;onable, we cut them off from a liberal in&s;truc|tion; yet at the very time that we lay a manacle on their under&s;tandings, affect to de&s;pi&s;e them for fools:&mdash;As if they were beings totally oppo&s;ite by nature to our&s;elves, we fancy that the &s;ame en|largement of mind, which is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us, is utterly improper for them; and &s;uppo&s;e that the better capable they are of acting in life, the wor&s;e they mu&s;t behave of cour&s;e. Such are the &s;entiments entertained by the high and mighty lords of the creation, relative to the education of the ladies. What wonder, therefore, or what pity is it, that we are &s;o frequently unhappy in our daughters and our wives? Are we not in fact an&s;werable for every error re&s;ulting from their ignorance, &s;ince that ignorance is principally oc|ca&s;ioned by our&s;elves? And &s;hould we not con|&s;equently, in&s;tead of throwing the whole blame at their doors, remove it entirely to our own?</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this paper with a few memo|randums, written by an excellent young lady lately decea&s;ed, who was brought up in a very different manner from the generality of her &s;ex: they were communicated to me ye&s;terday by her father, with tears in his eyes, and &s;hall &s;tand as a la&s;ting monu|ment
<PB N="179" REF="194">
of &s;o de&s;erving a daughter's virtue and under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>MEM. Being now eighteen years of age, and ha&s;ting to that period of life, in which I am to prove my gratitude to the be&s;t of parents, let me always make it a rule to prefer the gratification of their wi&s;hes to the enjoyment of my own.</P>
<P>MEM. A parent is entitled to the fir&s;t place in every child's e&s;teem, and &s;he that can be deficient in a point of duty here, ought ju&s;tly to be &s;u&s;pected of infidelity in the di&s;charge of every other.</P>
<P>MEM. By all means to be &s;trictly attentive in the wor&s;hip of my creator, as I can never expect a fu|ture ble&s;&s;ing without &s;hewing a becoming gratitude for a pa&s;t.</P>
<P>MEM. Always to believe a man has the ba&s;e&s;t de&s;igns, who wants me to conceal his addre&s;&s;es from my father.</P>
<P>MEM. Never to hear the prote&s;tations of any man who has behaved di&s;honourably to another woman.</P>
<P>MEM. In all companies to treat tho&s;e with the greate&s;t &s;hare of deference, who are mo&s;t unhappy in their per&s;ons or their circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>MEM. Whoever calls me godde&s;s, angel, or ony other ridiculous appellation, though never &s;o fa&s;hionable, &mdash; a fool.</P>
<P>MEM. Mi&s;s Polly Beaufort extremely unea&s;y at &s;eeing Mr. Beverley &s;peaking to me in the drawing room la&s;t Sunday evening; &mdash; to avoid conver&s;ing
<PB N="180" REF="195">
with that gentleman as much as po&s;&s;ible for the future.</P>
<P>POOR Mrs. John&s;on, the &s;hoemaker's widow, and three children in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Mem. To allow them a guinea a week till a happy alte|ration in their circum&s;tances, and to &s;ave this ar|ticle out of unnece&s;&s;ary expences in hou&s;e-keeping and cloaths.</P>
<P>SIR John Blandford, a man of much merit whom I fear has &s;ome &s;entiments in my favour, I mu&s;t avoid with the nice&s;t circum&s;pection: for as I can|not return his e&s;teem, it would be infamous to mi&s;lead him with chimerical notions; and inhuman to treat him with deri&s;ion or di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>MEM. To &s;end the hackney coachman's wife, as much as my papa got the fellow fined in, for be|having in&s;olently la&s;t Tue&s;day, when we were &s;ud|dently caught in a &s;hower, and coming from the Park.</P>
<P>MEM. Mr. Winworth, a mo&s;t de&s;erving and accompli&s;hed gentleman; to think no more of him, (if I can help it) unle&s;s he &s;hould be mentioned by my papa.</P>

<P>NEXT to an invariable rectitude of conduct there is no light in which the character of a man can po&s;&s;ibly appear &s;o amiable as in a hearty concern for his errors, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are

more the con&s;equence of human infirmity than the effect of a mean premeditation. &mdash; In proportion to the repentance or atonement, we are apt to rai&s;e him in our e&s;teem; and it is not the lea&s;t part of his merit, that libertines them&s;elves are lo&s;t in an admiration of his behaviour, however &s;low, through a ridiculous fear of public contempt, they may be to imitate an action which they cannot in &s;pite of fa&s;hion or education forbear to love.</P>
<P>MY nephew, Harry Rattle, called upon me this morning, and after the u&s;ual how do you do of the day, pulled out a letter from the identical Mr. Bumper, whom in a former paper I mentioned as having &s;ent Harry a challenge for refu&s;ing to drink a &s;trumpet he had toa&s;ted one night after &s;upper at his own hou&s;e. &mdash; Mr. Bumper is a young man of nine and twenty, who has received a liberal edu|cation; is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of twelve hundred pounds a year; and though he has launched pretty freely into the cu&s;tomary exce&s;&s;es of the times, has been di&s;&s;olute rather from fa&s;hion than inclination. &mdash; For a few weeks pa&s;t he has been at a tenant's in Berk&s;hire, from whence, two days ago, he &s;ent the following letter to Harry, with permi&s;&s;ion to communicate it through my means to the notice of the public.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>TO HARRY RATTLE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Harry,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t letter I told you how deeply I was &s;truck with the per&s;on of Sally Poplar, my te|nant's
<PB N="182" REF="197">
daughter, and expre&s;&s;ed an intention of &s;et|ting out immediately for London, for fear I &s;hould &s;ucceed in any de&s;ign prejudicial to her innocence and virtue. &mdash; Yet notwith&s;tanding I was perfectly convinced how nece&s;&s;ary a &s;tep of that nature would be, I could not work my&s;elf up to a &s;ufficient re&s;olution of quitting the place. &mdash; I flattered my|&s;elf I &s;hould be able to re&s;i&s;t every temptation, yet indulge my&s;elf a few days longer under the &s;ame roof with the bewitching ru&s;tic; and though I knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible to po&s;&s;e&s;s this happi|ne&s;s without &s;aying &s;ome tender things to her; I neverthele&s;s thought I &s;hould avoid carrying matters to any critical length, by a criminal importunity. &mdash; From my example however, the unthinking part of our acquaintance may be in&s;tructed, that it is infinitely wi&s;er to fly from a temptation, than to combat with an opportunity. &mdash; The moment a man is alone with a woman he admires, and from whom he has received &s;ome indications of recipro|cal e&s;teem, human nature mu&s;t not be human na|ture, if he does not endeavour to improve &s;o fair an occa&s;ion of gratifying his wi&s;hes: he may fancy he will go to &s;uch and &s;uch lengths, and no fur|ther; but pa&s;&s;ion will hurry him imperceptibly from liberty to liberty, and he will find it utterly im|po&s;&s;ible to retain the lea&s;t con&s;ideration for the un|happy girl, when he has totally loft all con&s;idera|tion for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>SUCH was my ca&s;e the night before la&s;t; Sally and I lay on the &s;ame floor, and &s;he had promi&s;ed
<PB N="183" REF="198">
to let me chat half an hour with her before &s;he went to bed. &mdash; This half hour was productive of another and another, till at la&s;t the poor girl was worked up to &s;uch a pitch of tenderne&s;s, that &s;he could refu&s;e nothing; and then it was I found, in &s;pite of all my humanity, that there was no po&s;&s;ibi|lity of getting off. &mdash; It would have been very &s;trange, after pre&s;&s;ing three hours for the la&s;t favour, which all the time I was in hopes would have been refu&s;ed, if I had withdrawn the moment it was granted: the con&s;equence therefore was, that after I had been ra&s;cal enough to deprive her of her rea&s;on, I was villain enough to &s;eize the op|portunity which that &s;u&s;pen&s;ion gave me;
<Q><L>And for a moment's guilt, de&s;troyed</L>
<L>A life of &s;potle&s;s fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>WE had &s;carcely fallen a&s;leep, (do not laugh, Rattle, we &s;lept upon my &s;oul) but old Mrs. Poplar having, as &s;he imagined, forgot to &s;ee that the kitchen fire was out, (a piece of care which &s;he never omitted,) came down &s;tairs, and pa&s;&s;ing by Sally's door, which in the confu&s;ion of affairs we had neglected to lock, turned the bolt and came in. &mdash; I need not attempt to paint her a&s;toni&s;hment, &mdash; nor, upon being waked, our own &s;urprize. &mdash; Sally &s;hrieked, and hid beneath the cloathes; Mrs. Poplar wrung her hands in a fit of unutterable di&s;|traction, and de&s;ired her hu&s;band to come in&s;tantly down; the good man, terrified out of his wits for fear his de&s;k had been broke open, or his hou&s;e &s;et on flames, made what ha&s;te he could: but never
<PB REF="199">
was di&s;tre&s;s or con&s;ternation &s;o great, as when he found out the real &s;ituation of affairs, and beheld the de&s;truction of his only child: for a moment he was petrified; till at la&s;t recovering the u&s;e of his recollection, he ca&s;t a look at me, that cut me to the very &s;oul, and crying, O Sir! bur&s;t into a vio|lent flood of tears. &mdash; In my life I never was &s;o much affected; I felt my&s;elf truly de&s;picable, and was at once torn with &s;hame and remor&s;e. &mdash; To a man not utterly de&s;titute of humanity and reflexion, Harry, no circum&s;tances could be &s;o mortifying; in&s;tead of gratitude for the cordial welcome which I had received in the hou&s;e of my friend, I had violated the ho&s;pitality of his roof, and robbed the darling of his age, of what ought to be infinitely dearer than her life. &mdash; The girl I doated on to death &s;eemed ab&s;orbed in di&s;traction, and her worthy parents were almo&s;t lo&s;t in de&s;pair. &mdash; What could I do Harry? the torture of the damned was an Ely&s;ium to what I &s;uffered; and without re|paration, of what &s;ervice was it to repent? Thus &s;ituated, I begged Mr. Poplar and his wife to withdraw till I was dre&s;&s;ed, and then I would en|deavour to &s;atisfy them: they did &s;o, and went down to the parlour; I followed them in a few mi|nutes, and &s;ummoning all the fortitude I could, delivered my&s;elf to the following purport: <Q>I will not, my good Mr. and Mrs. Poplar, go about to excu&s;e the tran&s;actions of to-night, but own my&s;elf a very dirty &s;coundrel; however, as there is no po&s;&s;ibility of recalling what is pa&s;t, I &s;hall
<PB N="185" REF="200">
readily make all the atonement in my power, and if I have your con&s;ent, will marry Sally to-morrow morning.</Q> &mdash; The tran&s;port of the worthy old couple was now as violent as their &s;orrow had been but a moment before. &mdash; Mr. Poplar looked at me for &s;ome time with a fixed at|tention, then broke into an exce&s;&s;ive laugh which po&s;&s;ibly might have proved fatal had he not thrown him&s;elf into his great chair, and found a &s;ea&s;onable relief in a flood of tears.</P>
<P>WELL, Harry, what &s;ay you to my behaviour? I have been married a week, and am convinced that virtue is it's own reward; for in my days I never ta&s;ted felicity till now; every eye beams on me with gratitude and e&s;teem, and when I enter into an examination of my own heart, all is approba|tion and joy. &mdash; I am &s;atisfied of your concurrence, my dear Harry, and as for fools and ra&s;cals, their opinions is what a man of &s;peculation mu&s;t both de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t; it is not for the &s;atisfaction of others we are to live, but our own; therefore tho&s;e actions which &s;ecure that &s;atisfaction, &s;ince it mu&s;t always be founded on a rectitude of principle, are the be&s;t te&s;ts, both of the goodne&s;s of our hearts and the &s;oundne&s;s of our under&s;tandings.</P>

<P>IT was an admirable reply which Socrates once made to an impertinent coxcomb, who de|manded what he would do if there was no other world after this. I need not inform the intelligent reader that this celebrated philo&s;opher was as eminent for the rectitude of his life as the greatne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, and that upon all occa&s;ions he maintained the certainty of a future &s;tate, where every man was to be rewarded according to his de|&s;erts. &mdash; <Q>What &s;hall I do, returned Socrates, if there is not another world after this?</Q> <Q>Why, at any rate I &s;hall be as well off as you are? &mdash; But what will you do if there is?</Q></P>
<P>IT is really &s;urprizing that the force of this ex|cellent an&s;wer is not always pre&s;ent to the minds of tho&s;e people who either take upon them ab&s;o|lutely to deny the exi&s;tence of another world, or act in &s;uch a manner as if they looked upon a belief of it to be utterly ridiculous and ab&s;urd. Com|mon policy, one would imagine, &s;hould incline them to a uniform rectitude of life, if they were not actuated by real goodne&s;s, and in&s;pire, if to|tally in&s;en&s;ible of gratitude to the great author of their being, &s;omething like a rea&s;onable concern for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider, though ever &s;o &s;lightly, on the nature of man, and reflect on the important
<PB N="187" REF="202">
&s;omething which is continually deciding upon every action, in the human bo&s;om, we can &s;carcely think it po&s;&s;ible that there is one man in the whole cir|cuit of creation, who is dead to the belief of a future &s;tate, or is really of opinion that there is no &s;uch being as a God. His own heart mu&s;t be an evidence again&s;t him, and he mu&s;t feel the certain|ty of another exi&s;tence, though he may be apt to cry out with CATO, "when or where?"</P>
<P>BUT however if there is even a po&s;&s;ibility to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a cla&s;s of creatures as Athei&s;ts in being, yet every day's experience will point out millions to our view who&s;e &s;ituation is infinitely more ter|rible, and who are more entitled to the abhorrence of the world as well as more expo&s;ed to the ven|geance of their God. A di&s;ordered mind or a weak under&s;tanding may be advanced as &s;ome little miti|gation of the wretch's infidelity who denies the ex|i&s;tence of his Creator; but what excu&s;e can he have, who acknowle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ges the power, the wi&s;dom, and the goodne&s;s of the Deity, yet lives as if he be|lieved there was no Deity at all?

<P>THERE is a certain mode of behaviour in the world which is entirely founded upon Self, and proceeds from nothing but a pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of gratifying our own inclinations; yet which upon all occa&s;ions, lays claim to the title of unbound|ed benevolence and genero&s;ity, and puts in for the univer&s;al admiration in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, where it ought to meet with nothing but the univer&s;al contempt. &mdash; A letter however which I have lately received from a lady, who &s;igns her&s;elf <Q>A mi&s;er|able woman of quality,</Q> will elucidate this mat|ter perhaps better than the mo&s;t elaborate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which I could po&s;&s;ibly enter into, and therefore I &s;hall make no apology for laying it before my readers.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you &s;eem good-naturedly ready to pay greater regard to the circum&s;tances than the compliments of your corre&s;pondents, I &s;hall begin with as little ceremony as I intend taking leave, and neither tre&s;pa&s;s on your lei&s;ure with a ful&s;ome encomium nor an unnece&s;&s;ary excu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="206">You mu&s;t know, Sir, I am the daughter of a private gentleman in Oxford&s;hire, who had a large family to provide for, upon a very moderate e&s;tate. There were &s;ix of us, and but three hundred a year to an&s;wer all contingencies. &mdash; Happily in|deed, I was the only girl among&s;t them, &s;o that with a little intere&s;t, as my father was generally beloved, four of my brothers were fortunate enough, to be preferred in the navy, the army, and public offices; the elde&s;t and my&s;elf were the only re|maining children at home, and my poor papa, who&s;e favourites we particularly &s;eemed to be, re|&s;olved to compen&s;ate by an unwearied attention to our education, for the apparent narrowne&s;s of our fortunes. &mdash; As for me, before I was fifteen, be&s;ides all the cu&s;tomary needleworks peculiar to my &s;ex, I &s;poke French and Italian pretty tollerably, danced an ea&s;y minuet enough; &s;ung an agreeable little &s;ong, and played a le&s;&s;on at &s;ight on my harp&s;i|chord: what was however infinitely more e&s;&s;en|tial, though now &s;eldom con&s;idered as any part of a young woman's education, I could never &s;leep without &s;aying my prayers, and at church was no way a&s;hamed of repeating the ten commandments or rai&s;ing a p&s;alm with the re&s;t of the congrega|tion. &mdash; My per&s;on was not in the lea&s;t tortured into any fa&s;hionable form by &s;trait laicing; and as for my face, it was rather more whole&s;ome than lovely, and not &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed by any &s;ur|prizing delicacy of complexion as by a certain air of complacency and chearfulne&s;s, which I flatter
<PB N="192" REF="207">
my&s;elf be&s;poke neither a corrupt heart nor a total want of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>EXCUSE me, Mr. Babler, for being thus tedi|ou&s;ly and perhaps vainly circum&s;tantial about either my acquired or per&s;onal qualifications; but as they were the only cau&s;es of my great, (I mu&s;t not &s;ay my good fortune) I thought there might be &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity for more than a cur&s;ory de&s;cription of both.</P>
<P>BETWEEN the age of fifteen and twenty, &s;uch as my little attractions were, they procured me no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of admirers, and I had more than one opportunity of marrying very advantage|ou&s;ly: no per&s;on however engaging my inclination, my father never offered to pre&s;s me on the &s;ubject, but always tenderly declared his poor girl &s;hould choo&s;e for her&s;elf in a ca&s;e where &s;he was the mo&s;t principally intere&s;ted. &mdash; When I was ju&s;t turned of twenty, an occa&s;ion for &s;uch a choice occured; and he readily con&s;ented to the &s;olicitations of a young gentleman, who had been left an e&s;tate of eight hundred a year, in our neighbourhood, by the will of a relation at that time about &s;ix months decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT alas, Sir, &s;ee the uncertainty of all human expectations; three or four days before the inten|ded &s;olemnization of our nuptials, a certain noble earl, of an immen&s;e fortune, had his carriage acci|dentally broke down within a few yards of my fa|ther's &mdash; Mr. Bil&s;on my lover, and I, were looking out of the window at that in&s;tant, and immediately
<PB N="193" REF="208">
ran out to offer the civilities of the hou&s;e to his lord&s;hip, who frankly accepted the invitation, and &s;taid there the whole night. &mdash; My father made every thing as agreeable as could be to his illu&s;tri|ous gue&s;t, and was not a little &s;urprized the next morning, when the nobleman told him I had made an impre&s;&s;ion on his heart, and offered a &s;et|tlement &s;o very large, that, my poor papa dazzled with that, and the de&s;ire of &s;eeing his favourite Nancy a counte&s;s, immediately forgot all his former re&s;olutions, to allow me a liberty of choo&s;ing for my&s;elf, and declared his lord&s;hip &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my hand whenever he thought pro|per to mention a day for that purpo&s;e. &mdash; Why need I tre&s;pa&s;s on your patience, Mr. Babler, to paint either my own di&s;traction or the frantic be|haviour of Mr. Bil&s;on. &mdash; Suffice it, Sir, that in a week after, I was dragged half dead to the altar, and torn from the only man I ever could love, to be wedded to one whom I never can.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of my complaint, Sir, now comes to be mentioned.&mdash; I have been married three years, and endeavoured to make the mo&s;t of my wretched circum&s;tances, by compen&s;ating with the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;charge of my duty, for an apparent want of love. &mdash; This is not &s;ufficient for his lord&s;hip: mortified that he can engage no return of his af|fection, he is perpetually reproaching me with a want of gratitude; and always telling me of his prodigious conde&s;cen&s;ion in rai&s;ing me to the rank of a counte&s;s, from the former ob&s;curity of my &s;itu|ation.
<PB N="194" REF="209">
&mdash; Thus, Sir, he thinks I am obliged to him for making me mi&s;erable; and imagines I ought to &s;tudy nothing but the continual repo&s;e of his bo&s;om, becau&s;e he has generou&s;ly planted everla&s;t|ing daggers in mine. &mdash; There are many women, Mr. Babler, alike unhappily circum&s;tanced; it would therefore be kind, if you de&s;ired our di&s;in|tere&s;ted hu&s;bands to remember for who&s;e &s;ake they have thus graciou&s;ly honoured us with their names; and to con&s;ider, it was not out of any regard for the promotion of our wi&s;hes, but through a mean, and very often an illiberal de&s;ire of gra|tifying their own.&mdash; Your paper is left at our hou&s;e once a week, and if you will in&s;ert this, my lord will perhaps be convinced he is more intitled to my aver&s;ion than my e&s;teem, and be fully &s;atisfied he has made me</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT a little &s;nug retirement in Derby&s;hire I am always favoured with your paper once a week, and as I think it no le&s;s in&s;tructive than en|tertaining, I heartily wi&s;h, for the benefit of the world, that all our authors were as ea&s;y in their minds, as from the apparent facility of his produc|tions, I conclude the agreeable writer of the Babler. If I may deliver my &s;entiments, I am really of opinion, that the decline of literature ari&s;es more from a want of encouragement than a want of ge|nius in the kingdom; and though I &s;hall not pre|&s;ume to rank my&s;elf among men of real abilities, yet I believe the principal p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt of tho&s;e who can, have more than once experienced &s;ome of the mor|tifications which I am about to relate, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> found
<PB N="196" REF="211">
them not a little prejudicial to that force of ima|gination &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite for a writer of any character.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, I was &s;ent very early to the Univer&s;ity, in order to get my&s;elf qua|lified for a living, which a certain nobleman had in his gift, and which he repeatedly a&s;&s;ured my fa|ther &s;hould be at my &s;ervice on the death of the in|cumbent, if it was thought worth while on that account to educate me for the church. Unfortu|nately however, before I was at Oxford three years, his lord&s;hip, who had &s;at up all night, was taken off by an unexpected accident; for mounting a &s;trange hunter the next morning at a gentleman's &s;eat, where he was then upon a vi&s;it; he pur&s;ued the game with too incautious a re&s;olution, and broke his neck in taking a five barr'd gate: with him peri&s;hed my expectations; and I was taken from the College directly.</P>
<P>DURING my &s;tay at the Univer&s;ity, I made &s;everal little e&s;&s;ays in the various walks of literature, merely for my amu&s;ement, which were &s;o favoura|bly received by tho&s;e exalted geniu&s;es the compilers of magazines, that they generally honoured them with the appellation of elegant, and reque&s;ted the continuation of my corre&s;pondence; this gave me a &s;trong propen&s;ity to writing, and as I looked upon an author to be the greate&s;t of all &s;ublunary cha|racters, I was ambitious of gaining &s;o honourable a title, and through this unaccountable infatuation, neglected every nece&s;&s;ary means of promoting my future intere&s;t and fortune. It is true, my father
<PB N="197" REF="212">
bound me to an eminent attorney; but alas, Sir, Homer and Virgil were con&s;ulted infinitely more than either Littleton or Coke; and in&s;tead of Replies, Rejoinders, or Demurrers, I was in the mid&s;t of term engaged in writing &s;ome poetical whim&s;ies of my own, or in commenting on tho&s;e of other people. The little all that came to me on my father's decea&s;e was &s;oon expended, and I found my&s;elf in an in&s;tant left to bu&s;tle through an inho&s;pitable world, without either money, bu&s;ine&s;s, or bread. In this dilemma nece&s;&s;ity obliged me to have recour&s;e to the book&s;ellers: I was accordingly enli&s;ted into the army of literary mercenaries, and, like the humble&s;t cla&s;s of &s;oldiers, obliged for the mo&s;t pitiful pittance, to run a frequent ri&s;que of my reputation, and &s;ometimes a dangerous hazard of my life. Fame indeed came in tollerably fa&s;t, but &s;till I ran deeper and deeper into debt: I was totally unacquainted with the cu&s;toms of the trade, and the book&s;ellers having me in their power, con|&s;cientiou&s;ly treated me as they plea&s;ed. I was con|fined to my regular hours of work as if I was a &s;hoemaker or a taylor, and very often ordered to do a particular quantity in a particular time. Some|times, Sir, I have been obliged to write a philo&s;o|phical e&s;&s;ay on contentment, when my heart was bur&s;ting with angui&s;h; and at others, ordered to produce a poem on liberty, while the bailiffs were waiting at the door; but the &s;evere&s;t mortification of all was, the impertinent freedom with which I was treated by every ragamuffin of the pre&s;s; the
<PB N="198" REF="213">
printer would critici&s;e on my performances to my face; and the very devils them&s;elves would talk to me of mi&s;takes, and propo&s;e what they were mo|de&s;tly plea&s;ed to con&s;ider as amendments; nay, &s;ometimes they have invited me to club for a pot of porter, or a&s;ked me to take a game at all-fours at the Goo&s;e and Gridiron. For fourteen years, Mr. Babler, did I continue this comfortable life, when la&s;t winter but one, having written a political trea|ti&s;e which occa&s;ioned &s;ome noi&s;e, a nobleman of great eminence kindly enquired for the author, found me out, generou&s;ly paid my debts, and a&s;|&s;igned me an apartment in his own hou&s;e: I now thought my&s;elf made for ever; but I had &s;carcely been a month in the hou&s;e, when my lord's ad|miration of my abilities began to abate a little; he expected as an author that I &s;hould &s;upport every ab&s;urdity he advanced in an argument; and as a man of genius, that I &s;hould always be comical. With this view he introduced me into all compa|nies; but when he &s;aw I would neither be his pa|ra&s;ite nor his buffoon, his friend&s;hip very vi&s;ibly de|clined: at table I was in&s;ulted with the propo&s;al of a wager wherever I pre&s;umed to di&s;&s;ent in opinion, and then it was in&s;tantly recollected with a loud laugh, that authors were but &s;eldom overburthened with money. In the large&s;t circle of his acquaint|ance, my lord by an affected compliment of con|dolence, would paint out my former di&s;tre&s;s, and then in&s;inuate the merit of his own genero&s;ity in relieving it: at other times, he u&s;ed me with an
<PB N="199" REF="214">
intollerable in&s;olence of &s;uperiority, and then affect|ed to be di&s;plea&s;ed when he put me out of coun|tenance; in &s;hort, I almo&s;t determined to go back to my old profe&s;&s;ion again, as thinking it better to &s;uffer a &s;ecret affront, than to be thus publickly contemptible; I was &s;oon &s;ettled in my re&s;olution, for the dining-room je&s;ts on my profe&s;&s;ion and cir|cum&s;tances began to be bandied about in the kitchen; and the Butler, under a pretened air of &s;implicity and ignorance, came one day up to my apartment, and begged me to rai&s;e the devil, that he might enquire after one or two of his &s;ilver &s;poons. Providence however took pity on me at la&s;t; a worthy gentleman, who&s;e memory I &s;hall ever revere, that had &s;een me two or three times at my lord's table, thought of me &s;o kindly as to &s;et me down a hundred a year for life in his will, and as he was very old and infirm, &s;carcely &s;urvived his generous donation ten days. I heard of it but the very morning I took my leave of his lord&s;hip; and though I dropt a tear to the memory of my bene|factor, I could not help rejoicing at &s;o fortunate an alteration in my circum&s;tances. I have now lived a twelvemonth in Derby&s;hire, quite happy in my&s;elf and re&s;pected by every body, and have &s;ent you this letter to point out the real cau&s;e of that decline in literature, which has of late years been &s;o univer&s;ally complained of in this kingdom.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was a very wi&s;e &s;aying of an old Philo&s;opher, that Happine&s;s was infinitely &s;weeter in the Expectation than in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ince the gene|rality of mankind are rather apt to over-value what they have not, and to &s;et too &s;mall an e&s;timation upon what they actually have. I remember, Sir, about thirty years ago, when my circum&s;tances were a little contracted, I fancied no man could be mi&s;erable who was ma&s;ter of a great e&s;tate: 'Tis inconceivable how I u&s;ed to lye in bed of a morning building ca&s;tles in the air, and chalking out future plans of genero&s;ity and magnificence if my &s;tars &s;hould ever kindly indulge me with this <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of human felicity! &mdash; I have been a member of Parliament; have drawn up an impeach|ment again&s;t Sir <HI>Robert</HI>; &mdash; harangued the Hou&s;e like a Cherubim; &mdash; received gold boxes from every corporation in the kingdom; &mdash; refu&s;ed a Peerage; &mdash; and, married, a woman of exqui&s;ite
<PB N="201" REF="216">
beauty and immen&s;e fortune, in the &s;pace of half an hour; when, oh dreadful cata&s;trophe! all the&s;e golden fanta&s;ies have been in an in&s;tant &s;wept from my imaginations, by the milk-woman's yell at the door, the falling of the tongs, or the accidental jump of our old black cat.</P>
<P>YET, Sir, though my finances were moderate enough at the time I am &s;peaking of, &s;till I found more &s;atisfaction in indulging tho&s;e imaginary, ob|jects of felicity than ever I experienced &s;ince I came, by the death of a very di&s;tant relation, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two thou&s;and pounds a year. I flatter my&s;elf I am no more of the mi&s;er than the generality of my neighbours; and, if know my own heart, it is as likely to feel for the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the unfortunate, and as willing to relieve them, as &s;ome whom I know to pique them&s;elves mightily on the humanity of their tempers. But this is not the point &mdash; My fortune has, I may al|mo&s;t &s;ay, unhinged the &s;y&s;tem upon which I for|merly built my happine&s;s, and the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cuts off every plea&s;ure which originally re&s;ulted from a chimerical expectation.</P>
<P>THIS you will probably look upon as a very ex|traordinary circum&s;tance, but it is neverthele&s;s literally true; in&s;tead of being able to reap any great plea&s;ure from an e&s;tate, I find it productive of no|thing but unea&s;ine&s;s and anxiety; my wants are very limited and &s;oon gratified; and the very &s;u|perflux of fortune, which to any other man might po&s;&s;ibly be a matter of the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, is
<PB N="202" REF="217">
to me a con&s;tant &s;ource of vexation and regret. In the fir&s;t place, I have no child to enjoy my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions after I am gone, and I am nothing more than ama&s;&s;ing for people, who envy me when liv|ing, and will in all likelihood de&s;pi&s;e me when dead: The very man to whom I leave my e&s;tate, will perhaps be the fir&s;t to d&mdash;n the old curmud|geon for not tipping off half a dozen years &s;ooner, and tho&s;e for whom I am continually doing a great deal, the readie&s;t to execrate my memory becau&s;e I have not done a great deal more.</P>
<P>BUT though a &s;en&s;ibility of this nature might in &s;ome mea&s;ure render me regardle&s;s to the care of my affairs, I look upon it as an indi&s;pen&s;ible part of my duty to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible the lea&s;t di&s;advantage from my negligence and inattention; and am le&s;s fearful of the <HI>probable</HI> contempt I <HI>may</HI> meet from my relations, than the <HI>certain</HI> ridicule I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;uffer from my tenants and dependants, was I to wink at a continual plunder of my property, and to permit them indi&s;criminately to grow opu|lent at my expence. Thus any way, Sir, whether I exert a commendable prudence, or throw it en|tirely a&s;ide, this unfortunate e&s;tate "clings like a dete&s;ted &s;in to my rememberance," and poi&s;ons every comfort which I once was weak enough to imagine it would have produced. If it rains for any time, I am fearful my corn will be wa&s;hed away; if the weather is uncommonly fine, I am apprehen&s;ive of its being parched up; if it freezes with &s;everity, alas, for my poor flower-garden;
<PB N="203" REF="218">
if the wind happens to be high, my apple|trees are de&s;troyed; and if it &s;hows, I am in an ab&s;olute ague about my little lambs, and eternally &s;colding John and Thomas for not taking &s;ufficient care to pre&s;erve them from the inclemency of the weather; thus again, in whatever manner the wi&s;dom of the Deity thinks proper to direct the &s;ea&s;ons, I am &s;ure to &s;hew an impious di&s;&s;atisfac|tion at his decrees, and, to u&s;e the emphatical words of Mr. Pope, with a little alteration,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE good-natured readine&s;s with which I &s;ee you in&s;ert a variety of letters upon dome&s;tic occurrences, has induced me to trouble you with a complaint again&s;t my hu&s;band, in hopes that his error may be avoided by others at lea&s;t, though it &s;hould fail of the intended reformation in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Sir, my good man is a &s;hop|keeper near Cripplegate, and as hone&s;t a pains|taking young fellow as any of his bu&s;ine&s;s; but his notions are rather too elevated for his circum|&s;tances; &s;o that neither the &s;tricte&s;t indu&s;try nor the mo&s;t rigid integrity, are likely to carry him pro&s;perou&s;ly through life, unle&s;s I can prevail upon him to change the pre&s;ent frame of his inclination. As the principal part of his acquaintance are trade&s;men of eminence, and have their &s;nug little country hou&s;es to retire to of a Sunday, my hu&s;|band determined to make as genteel a figure as the be&s;t of them, and accordingly took a hand&s;ome box enough la&s;t &s;ummer near Stratford. It was in vain that I repre&s;ented the inconveniences which it would inevitably produce, or mentioned a word about the prodigious expence. I was told that Mr. Refine, the Gold&s;mith, our next door neigh|bour, was as little able to afford &s;uch a circum|&s;tance
<PB N="205" REF="220">
as our&s;elves; it was ob&s;erved, that Sir Richard Steele &s;omewhere &s;aid, the &s;ure&s;t method of making a good fortune, was to carry the ap|pearance of an ea&s;y one; and that &s;urely it was very hard, if we could not have a place where we might enjoy a little peace and quietne&s;s one day in the week. To crown the whole, my hu&s;band, like many other people, when they have a favourite point to carry, was re&s;olved to find rea&s;ons enough to &s;upport not only the propriety but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of his behaviour, and brought one which was unan&s;werable; he complained his health was con&s;iderably impaired by a con&s;tant re&s;idence in town, and in&s;i&s;ted that nothing but a change of air was able to recover it. This &s;ilenced me at once; and a hou&s;e of twenty-&s;ix pounds a year, with a neat pretty garden behind it, was taken immediately, contiguous to the road &s;ide, for the greater facility of taking the &s;tage coach, and &s;ee|ing the various rounds of company that pa&s;&s;ed by.</P>
<P>As our hou&s;e has a very reputable appearance without, my hu&s;band was re&s;olved that a corre|&s;pondence &s;hould be kept up within; and there|fore furni&s;hed it very genteelly, laying out no le&s;s than three hundred pounds for this purpo&s;e. So large a &s;um expended as I may &s;ay upon an unnece&s;&s;ary account, was not a little inconvenient to a young couple, &s;carcely four years in trade, and who&s;e capital at fir&s;t was rather moderate: In fact, Sir, we &s;oon felt it, and were under the di&s;agreeable exigence of borrowing the &s;ame &s;um,
<PB N="206" REF="221">
at an intere&s;t of five per cent, to keep up our bu&s;i|ne&s;s with a proper degree of con&s;equence and punctuality. Well, Sir, every thing being in or|der at our new habitation, we entered upon it, to enjoy a mouthful of fre&s;h air and a little repo&s;e from the fatigues of the week. But &s;ee the uncertainty of all human expectations; the fairer the weather, the more we were deprived of the air; for being &s;ituated &s;o immediately on the road, we were choaked with a cloud of du&s;t if the window was kept open but a &s;ingle moment; and had no other pro&s;pect, but what was furni&s;hed by a lifele&s;s &s;tare through an humble pain of gla&s;s: if we retired backwards, we lo&s;t the variety which company af|forded, and &s;tood a chance of being &s;erenaded with the mu&s;ic of half a hundred hogs, which our next door neighbour had con&s;tantly breeding in his yard.</P>
<P>THIS circum&s;tance was very di&s;agreeable; but &s;till a material con&s;olation remained, that of en|joying our Sundays wholly uninterrupted: but here al&s;o, Mr. Babler, we were quickly unde|ceived. The moment we entered, our acquain|tance formed parties to dine at our hou&s;e, and any three or four who were at a lo&s;s to kill a Sunday, agreed, without any he&s;itation, to go and eat a bit of mutton with their friend, Will Sheffield, the hardware-man. By this means, Sir, in&s;tead of retiring to tranquility and repo&s;e, we opened a new &s;cene of bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion; and kept a hou&s;e for no other purpo&s;e, but to bring on an
<PB N="207" REF="222">
everla&s;ting round of drudgery, and a very heavy expence. Tho&s;e who know any thing of hou&s;e|keeping, Mr. Babler, are &s;en&s;ible how &s;mall a way a guinea goes in providing a decent entertainment for half a dozen people. I therefore leave you to judge, how agreeably I mu&s;t be &s;ituated, when forced to wear a con&s;tant appearance of the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction to the very people, whom, in my heart, I could have wi&s;hed in a hor&s;e-pond, or &s;colded-out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>DISAPPOINTED in all his expectation, Mr. Bab|ler, and the charm of novelty being al&s;o worn away, my hu&s;band is heartily &s;ick of his villa; yet is both a&s;hamed and affraid to throw it off his hands; he is fearful his friends will circulate the laugh again&s;t him, and is apprehen&s;ive his enemies will make u&s;e of it to prejudice him in his trade: I have told him over and over, it is better for him to be thought a blockhead, than to prove him&s;elf one; and much more to his intere&s;t to bear a ca&s;ual reflection on his circum&s;tances, than to be a beggar at once: I have pointed out a variety of trade&s;men, who&s;e ruin originally proceeded from the vanity of keep|ing a country hou&s;e, but all to no purpo&s;e; for though he acknowledges the ju&s;tice of my ob&s;er|vation, he remains incorrigible; and therefore I have thought it better to print his name in your paper than &s;uffer it to appear in the London Gazette.</P>
<P>WE have now three children, Sir, and this cur&s;|ed country hou&s;e, which we have not &s;et a foot

Pray, Sir, print my letter, that London Trade&s;men may fir&s;t get for|tunes before they entertain a notion of &s;pending them; and not for the vanity of occupying a coun|try hou&s;e, twenty or thirty days in a whole year, throw away what would purcha&s;e a hand&s;ome in|dependence for their whole lives.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DONT know a more prevailing error at pre&s;ent among all ranks of people, than an en|deavour to di&s;gui&s;e their real &s;ituation in life, by an appearance totally incon&s;i&s;tant with their cha|racter and circum&s;tances. This reflexion I am naturally led into by a vi&s;it which I paid the other morning to my old friend, Sir Timothy Trotter who has been many years in a declining way with the gout; but, who, neverthele&s;s, like another lord Chalk&s;tone, is all life and &s;pirits in the lucid in|tervals, as I may &s;ay, of his di&s;temper.</P>
<P>WHEN I was &s;hewed up &s;tairs, it did not a little &s;urprize me, to &s;ee two fellows, dre&s;&s;ed like grooms, &s;itting very familiarly by Sir Timothy's elbow-chair, with jockey-whips in their hands, talking in a carele&s;s indolent manner of hot ma&s;hes, long &s;tirrups, curry-combs, and curbs: as my old friend had always been remarkable for keeping the be&s;t company, I was the more amazed at &s;o odd a couple of vi&s;itors. I remember to have dined with him at the &s;quare, when there have been half a dozen &s;tars in the room, be&s;ides the two arch|bi&s;hops; and three of the foreign amba&s;&s;adors. However, as it was no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine, I &s;at down, and, in a little time, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="210" REF="225">
heard that the&s;e two de&s;picable looking things were no le&s;s than two noblemen of very great fortune, the earl of Snaffle worth and my lord Donefir&s;t.</P>
<P>STRUCK as I was at that time, I could not help reflecting, how unworthy a nobleman of Great Britain, a man born to be a legi&s;lator in the mo&s;t generous country of the univer&s;e, and honoured with &s;o great a degree of political &s;anctity, that his bare affirmation was con&s;idered as important as an oath, &s;hould be dre&s;t in a dirty pair of boots, grea&s;y leather breeches, a &s;triped flannel wai&s;tcoat, a thread-bare drab-coat, and a little round hat like a waterman's. No wonder, thought I, that the French &s;hould look upon us as a nation of paltry-minded people, when we &s;tudy to appear contemptible; and our very nobility, who ought to glory in keeping up the con&s;equence of their cha|racters, are a&s;hamed to look like what they are; and &s;neak from the dignity of titles into the high and mighty quality of grooms.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus reflecting, the &s;ervant came up, and told Sir Thomas, that Doctor Styptic, and Mr. Skirts the taylor, were below &s;tairs; upon which he was ordered, without much compliment I thought, to the Doctor, to &s;end them both up: he did &s;o; and a well-looking man, of about fifty, fir&s;t entered, dre&s;&s;ed in a very hand&s;ome &s;uit of full-trimm'd black, a large deep-bottom'd wig, and every nece&s;&s;ary article requi&s;ite for the &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s of the faculty. &mdash; Ay, thinks I, this gentle|man
<PB N="211" REF="226">
is perfectly in character; and is, I dare &s;ay, a &s;en&s;ible per&s;on, by &s;o clo&s;e an adherence to pro|priety. I had &s;carcely made the reflexion, how|ever, when Sir Thomas cried out, <Q>So Skirts, have you brought the breeches home?</Q> to which having received an an&s;wer in the affirmative, he returned, <Q>Well, that's an hone&s; fellow &mdash; go about your bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>BEING &s;o much di&s;appointed in the taylor, I wi&s;hed for the Doctor's appearance, and wondered what the deuce could detain him &s;o long: at la&s;t, the door opened, and a gentleman entered in a &s;uit of &s;potted &s;ilk, his hair nicely dre&s;t and bagg'd; and nothing about him but what be&s;poke the very meridian of Pari&s;ian elegance. &mdash; Thinks I, if this &s;hould be the Doctor! &mdash; My conjecture was not ill-founded; this was the identical &s;on of Galen, whom, if I had not &s;een actually writing a recipe, I &s;hould have po&s;itively taken for a French man of fa&s;hion, or a figure-dancer at the theatre.</P>
<P>WHEN I was ju&s;t going away, Sir Thomas's nephew, who has been lately called to the bar, came in from We&s;tmin&s;ter in his gown and tye|wig; well, &s;ays I to my&s;elf, thank heaven here is one man who is not a&s;hamed of appearing in character. But the young gentleman was not &s;eated above three minutes before he pulled off his wig in the pre&s;ence of the whole company, and &s;hewed as &s;mart a head of hair in the tyburn ta&s;te as could be found within the bills of mor|tality. &mdash; I &s;tared, and &s;aw the uncle was not a
<PB N="212" REF="227">
little diverted with my a&s;toni&s;hment; he thought the transformation a very capital circum&s;tance, and &s;eemed proud of a nephew who could alter|nately put on the gravity of the council, and the pertne&s;s of the footman. I was, however, di&s;gu&s;ted extremely, and took my leave, heartily convinced that nothing but a very great weakne&s;s of the mind could occa&s;ion &s;o many improprieties in the em|belli&s;hment of the per&s;on.</P>

<P>IT was a cu&s;tomary an&s;wer with the celebrated Dean Swift, when any body a&s;ked his opinion of a great man, "Stay till I &s;ee him in di&s;tre&s;s;" for my own part, though I think the reply ac|cording to the general &s;en&s;e of the world, extremely &s;ignificant, yet I can by no means imagine, that di&s;tre&s;s is the true touch&s;tone of fortitude: &s;o far on the contrary, it has been my po&s;itive belief for a long time, that he who can be&s;t &s;tand the &s;hock, as I may &s;ay, of pro&s;perity, gives the be&s;t proof of an even mind, and &s;hews the firme&s;t &s;tability of &s;oul, notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid by our mo&s;t celebrated philo&s;ophers on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Adver&s;ity has been ju&s;tly called the &s;chool of wi&s;dom by a variety of writers, be|cau&s;e there is nothing which is &s;o expeditious in
<PB N="213" REF="228">
bringing a man to a knowledge of him&s;elf. When reduced to a narrowne&s;s of circum&s;tances, or con|fined to the anxieties of a &s;ick bed, the mind na|turally turns her eye on tho&s;e objects which are mo&s;t likely to afford her con&s;olation and relief. Religion in a moment tells her the uncertainty of all human expectations, and bids her depend alone on tho&s;e bli&s;sful a&s;&s;urances of happine&s;s in another world, which experience has convinced her are &s;o extremely precarious in this: hence &s;he learns a proper mode of thinking, &s;hews an implicit &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the correcting hand of Providence, and becomes perfectly acquainted with what is due to others, from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of what is nece&s;&s;ary for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>PROSPERITY on the other hand may be con&s;i|dered the &s;chool of &s;elf-&s;ufficience and the almo&s;t perpetual parent of pride. Whenever the &s;un of pro&s;perity &s;heds a ray upon mankind, they are apt to grow important in their own opinions, and to think rather contemptibly of tho&s;e very people who were formerly on the li&s;t of their intimate friends; the goodne&s;s of the Deity they imagine to be the con&s;equence of particular merit, and look upon that as the re&s;ult of their own immediate &s;agacity, which is nothing but the unbounded benignity of their God. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, therefore, I cannot help imagining, but what true fortitude or equanimity is be&s;t &s;een in pro&s;perity. We ad|mire the tranquility of a Socrates going to die, but are ravi&s;hed with the un&s;welling moderation
<PB N="214" REF="229">
of a Cae&s;ar, when ma&s;ter of an empire, and &s;till retaining all the complacency of a private citizen.</P>
<P>I AM naturally led into the&s;e reflexions by a vi&s;it which I paid the other morning to my old friend Ned Blaze, to congratulate him on an e&s;tate of three thou&s;and pounds a year, which lately fell into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the will of an uncle, who good-naturedly left him every thing at his death, but who, while living, would not part with a &s;ix-penny piece to &s;ave him from de&s;truction. Ned, for many years pa&s;t has &s;truggled with all the diffi|culties of a high &s;pirit, a large family, and a very narrow fortune; &s;ometimes he has been obliged to &s;tay at home for months, and at others has been months in jail: yet &s;till he kept up his re&s;olution with all the fortitude of a Stoic, and behaved with a degree of decency and manline&s;s which procured him the univer&s;al e&s;teem, and not &s;eldom the uni|ver&s;al a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>AS I had always a regard for Ned, and if I may be excu&s;ed the egoti&s;m, had proved this regard upon more occa&s;ions than one , I was &s;incerely re|joiced at his good fortune, and the moment I heard of it &s;et out to tell him &s;o. When I came to his hou&s;e, in&s;tead of being in&s;tantly &s;hewn up &s;tairs by the maid, as had been the cu&s;tom former|ly, a fellow with a bag to his hair, long ruffles, and a laced livery, de&s;ired me, in broken Engli&s;h, to re&s;t my&s;elf in the parlour, and he would carry my name immediately to his ma&s;ter: well, I went into the parlour, &s;at down, and amu&s;ed my&s;elf a|above
<PB N="215" REF="230">
an hour with the elegant E&s;&s;ays of my worthy and ingenious friend, Dr. Gold&s;mith, which were accidentally lying in the window. My entertain|ment was too agreeable for me to think the time long, and I perhaps &s;hould not have thought about it at all, if the clock had not alarmed me with the &s;troke of two. Surprized at this unexpected delay, I touched the bell, and a&s;ked the &s;ervant if he had told his ma&s;ter of my being below; he replied in the affirmative, and added, that he would wait on me immediately.</P>
<P>IN about a quarter of an hour I heard the dining room door opened, and was informed of Mr. Blaze's approach, by a &s;low, heavy, con&s;equential &s;tamp on the &s;tairs; the &s;ervant threw open the parlour door for him as he de&s;cended, and my friend entered with all the gravity and importance of a very great man. As I fancied he might think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume this &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of appear|ance, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as the recent death of a near relation; I ran to him with my u&s;ual free|dom, gave him a hearty &s;hake by the hand, and &s;aid, <Q>Dear Ned, I am &s;incerely rejoiced at this happy alteration in your circum&s;tances.</Q> But I had no longer hone&s;t Ned Blaze to deal with, my familiarity I &s;aw was infinitely di&s;gu&s;ting. Mr. Blaze &s;tole his hand out of mine as &s;oon as he could, and making me a low bow, replied, "Mr. Babler I thank you." We then &s;at down, but our conver&s;ation lo&s;t all that &s;pirit and good-humour which we formerly thought it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed be|fore
<PB N="216" REF="231">
Mr. Blaze's unlucky acqui&s;ition of fortune; we were as ceremonious in an in&s;tant as if we had never &s;een each other before, and every ob&s;erva|tion upon the finene&s;s of the weather was intro|duced and concluded with a Sir &mdash; of perfect good breeding and gentility. Mr. Blaze, however, be|ing re&s;olved to &s;hew all his con&s;equence, rang, and enquired after the footmen by name, that I might judge the number of his dome&s;tics; he then order|ed one with a card to my Lord, and another with a compliment to his Grace, a&s;ked if the gold&s;mith had &s;ent home the new &s;ervice of plate, or if the vis a vis was yet fini&s;hed at the coach makers. This conver&s;ation with the &s;ervant was kept up with as much indolence and tediou&s;ne&s;s, as if no &s;uch per&s;on as my&s;elf had been in the room; I therefore thought it but ju&s;t to &s;hew a proper de|gree of re&s;entment, by immediately taking my leave; I did &s;o, after receiving a cool invitation to dinner, and being told there was nothing provided but ten or a dozen things, and no company but the Earl of Sharp&s;et, and the Counte&s;s of Ombre. When I went home I thought this little narrative would make a tolerable paper, as it &s;erved to rivet me in my belief, that the mo&s;t difficult &s;hock which any man can po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand, is that of pro&s;perity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH every body mu&s;t allow the cha|racter of a coquette to be truly de&s;picable even among the women, yet when we find it in the other &s;ex, there is &s;omething in it &s;o unmanly, that we feel a dete&s;tation equal to our contempt; and look upon the object to be as much an enemy as he is a di&s;grace to &s;ociety. To prove my a&s;&s;er|tion, however, Mr. Babler, give me leave to relate a circum&s;tance which lately happened in my own family; and which, if properly attended to, may be of real u&s;e to many of your fair readers.</P>
<P>I AM a merchant in the city, and have been above five years married to a mo&s;t de&s;erving woman, who, as &s;he &s;tudies every thing to promote my happine&s;s, obliges me to &s;hew a grateful &s;en|&s;ibility for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her's; and even warms me with a continual wi&s;h of anticipating the mo&s;t di&s;tant of her inclinations. About &s;ix months ago I took her younger &s;i&s;ter home, as I knew it would give her a &s;atisfaction; intending to &s;upply the lo&s;s of a father lately decea&s;ed, and to omit no opportunity of advancing her fortune.</P>
<P>MY attention could not have been placed on a more de&s;erving object: Harriot, Sir, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every
<PB N="218" REF="233">
beauty of per&s;on, and every virtue of mind that can render her either beloved, or re&s;pected; and is in one word, as accompli&s;hed a young woman as any in the kingdom: her circum&s;tances be&s;ides are no way incon&s;iderable; &s;he has ten thou&s;and pounds in the funds; and if &s;he marries to my liking, &s;hall not want for a thou&s;and or two more &mdash; but that does not &s;ignify.</P>
<P>AMONG the number of people, who vi&s;ited at our hou&s;e, Mr. Babler, the &s;on of a very eminent citizen frequently obliged us with his company; a circum&s;tance that plea&s;ed me not a little, as he was far from a di&s;agreeable man; his per&s;on was remarkably genteel, and his face po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a more than ordinary degree of &s;en&s;ibility; he con|ver&s;ed with much ea&s;e, was perfectly acquainted with men and things; and what rendered him a &s;till greater favourite, he &s;ung with an infinity of ta&s;te; and played with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of judgment on a variety of in&s;truments.</P>
<P>THIS gentleman had not long commenced an intimacy in my family before he &s;hewed a very vi&s;ible attachment for Harriot, hung upon every thing &s;he &s;aid, and approved of every thing &s;he did; but at the &s;ame time &s;eemed rather more ambitious to de&s;erve her e&s;teem, than to &s;olicit it. This I naturally attributed to his mode&s;ty, and it rather more confirmed me in the opinion which I entertained of his affection: had he treated her with the cu&s;tomary round of common place gal|lantry, I &s;hould never have believed him &s;erious;
<PB N="219" REF="234">
but when I &s;aw him a&s;&s;ume a continual appearance of the mo&s;t &s;ettled veneration and e&s;teem; when I &s;aw him unremittingly &s;tudious to catch the &s;malle&s;t opportunity of obliging, I was &s;atisfied there was no affectation in the ca&s;e, and convinced that every look was the &s;pontaneous effu&s;ion of his heart.</P>
<P>THE amiable Harriot unacquainted with art, &s;u&s;pected none; and being of a temper the mo&s;t generous her&s;elf, naturally entertained a favour|able opinion of every body el&s;e; Mr. Selby in par|ticular po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t place in her regard; the winning &s;oftne&s;s of his manners; the uncom|mon delicacy of his &s;entiments; and his profound re&s;pect for her, to &s;ay nothing of his per&s;onal at|tractions, all united to make an impre&s;&s;ion on her bo&s;om, and to in&s;pire her with the tendere&s;t emo|tions of a reciprocal love. She made her &s;i&s;ter her confident upon this occa&s;ion about a week ago, and Maria very properly told the matter immedi|ately to me. Finding Harriot's repo&s;e was &s;eri|ou&s;ly concerned, I determined to give Mr. Selby a fair opportunity of declaring him&s;elf the next evening, that there might be no po&s;&s;ibility of a mi&s;take in the ca&s;e, and that my poor girl might be certain &s;he had a heart in exchange for her own. With this view I engaged him on a <HI>tete a tete</HI> party to Vauxhall, and while he was lament|ing that my wife and &s;i&s;ter was not with us to par|ticipate in the amu&s;ement, I &s;aid gaily, <Q>Egad Tom I have a &s;trange notion that Harriot has
<PB N="220" REF="235">
done your bu&s;ine&s;s; you are eternally talking of her when &s;he's ab&s;ent, and as eternally lan|gui&s;hing at her when &s;he's by: How is all this? come own, have I been right in my gue&s;s, and treat me with the confidence of a friend?</Q></P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion quite di&s;concerted him; he blu&s;h|ed, &s;tammered, and, with a good deal of pre&s;&s;ing, at la&s;t drawled out, <Q>That Mi&s;s Harriot to be &s;ure was a mo&s;t de&s;erving young lady, and that was he inclined to alter his condition, there was not a woman in the world he would be &s;o proud of having for a wife. But tho' he was extreme|ly &s;en&s;ible of her merit, he had never con&s;ider|ed her in any light but that of a friend, and was to the la&s;t degree concerned if any little a&s;&s;idui|ties, the natural re&s;ult of his e&s;teem, had once been mi&s;interpreted, and placed to a different account.</Q></P>
<P>THE whole affair was now out, the man's cha|racter was immediately before me; and tho' I could have &s;acrificed him on the &s;pot for the meanne&s;s and barbarity of his conduct, yet I bridled my re|&s;entment, and would not indulge him with a tri|umph over Harriot, by letting him &s;ee I con&s;idered his late declaration as a matter of any con&s;equence; I therefore a&s;&s;umed a gaiety which was quite a &s;tranger to my heart, and replied, <Q>I am exce&s;|&s;ively glad Tom to hear you talk in this man|ner: faith I was afraid all had been over with you; and my friend&s;hip for you was the only rea&s;on of my enquiry, as I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect the
<PB N="221" REF="236">
young baggage has already made a di&s;po&s;al of her inclinations.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing a joyle&s;s evening, we returned to town quite &s;ick of one another's company; and pretty confidently determined to have no inter|cour&s;e for the future; when I had &s;et Mr. Selby down, I went to Maria and told her how things had turned out, and de&s;ired her to break them with all the delicacy &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of to her un|fortunate &s;i&s;ter; &s;he did &s;o; but the &s;hock is like|ly to prove fatal. Harriot has ever &s;ince kept her bed, and for the three la&s;t days has been quite de|lirous: &s;he raves continually on the villain who has murdered her peace of mind, and my ever-engaging Maria &s;its rivetted to the bed-&s;ide as con|tinually drenched in tears. In &s;pite of all my en|deavours to keep the matter private, the tattling of nur&s;es and &s;ervants has made it but too public, and denied us even the happine&s;s of being &s;ecretly mi&s;erable. The moment I heard it talked of, I called upon Mr. Selby and demanded &s;atisfaction; but could I expect a man to be brave who was ca|pable of acting &s;uch a part as his to a woman of honour and virtue? No, Sir, he called his &s;ervants about me in his own hou&s;e, and after my departure went and &s;wore the peace before a magi&s;trate. This is the only method which I have now left to puni&s;h him, and the only one al&s;o of exhorting parents and guardians to require an in&s;tant expla|nation from any man who &s;eems remarkably a&s;&s;i|duous

<P>COQUETRY, or a pa&s;&s;ion for exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t unlimited authority of affectation or caprice on a lover, is a foible which renders the ladies &s;o extremely ridiculous in the opinion of the world, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing how &s;uch a number of the fair-&s;ex can po&s;&s;ibly give into it; and for the mere &s;ake of making another unea&s;y, become ab&s;olutely contemptible them&s;elves. Ab&s;tracted, however, from the ridicule to which &s;uch a cha|racter is always expo&s;ed, there is a degree of mean|ne&s;s and cruelty in the compo&s;ition of a coquette, which throws the greate&s;t reflexion imaginable upon the benevolence of a lady's temper; and does not more depreciate the goodne&s;s of her heart, than le&s;&s;en the opinion we might entertain of her under&s;tanding. To delight in rendering a worthy man wretched, for the &s;ake of &s;hewing a little power, is &s;urely what the giddie&s;t creature in the univer&s;e mu&s;t condemn upon a moment's reflexion; and when &s;he moreover con&s;iders that his wretch|edne&s;s mu&s;t always be proportioned to his tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="223" REF="238">
for her, gratitude, as well as humanity, mu&s;t &s;hew her behaviour in a very culpable light, and tell her, that every pang which &s;he lodges in his bo&s;om, is an ab&s;olute di&s;honour to her own.</P>
<P>THE generality of the ladies have a want of candor to an&s;wer for, which is too often a &s;ource of the &s;evere&s;t anxiety to others, as well as a &s;pring of the greate&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment to them&s;elves: &mdash; Ravi&s;hed with the enchanting breath of admira|tion, they lend a greedy ear to the ardent language of prote&s;ting love; though at the &s;ame time it is a thou&s;and to one but they look upon the lover with the mo&s;t in&s;uperable contempt: hence, though they never intend to ble&s;s him with a riciprocal return, they never can prevail upon them&s;elves to give him a final di&s;charge, and the poor man is, in all probability, kept dangling for two or three years, till either avarice or inclination; a large e&s;tate, or a red coat, makes a conque&s;t of the heart, and (to u&s;e the emphatic words of the celebrated Doctor Young,)
<Q><L>&mdash; Amply gives, though treated long ami&s;s,</L>
<L>The man of merit his revenge in this.</L></Q>
For the honour of the ladies, however, I &s;hall introduce a little narrative to the public ob&s;erva|tion, which, I hope, will &s;erve as an example to my fair readers, and at the &s;ame time convince tho&s;e infidels who are aver&s;e to believing any thing laudable of the &s;ex, that they are to the full as capable of the mo&s;t exalted actions as our&s;elves,
<PB N="224" REF="239">
however we may erect the cre&s;t upon the &s;uperior dignity of manhood, or &s;well upon the acquired advantages of education and knowledge of the world.</P>
<P>ABOUT ten years ago a gentleman of con&s;ider|able family in Ireland, whom I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of Butler, being over on an excur&s;ion to this metropolis, he accidentally dined at a friend's hou&s;e in Pall-mall, where he fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with a young lady, whom I mu&s;t be equally free in concealing under the name of Lambton.</P>
<P>MR. Butler communicated his &s;entiments to his friend, who happened to be a relation of Mi&s;s Lambton's, and reque&s;ted his good offices with the lady. &mdash; The friend, who knew Mr. Butler to be a mo&s;t de&s;erving young fellow, and was &s;en&s;ible that in point of birth and fortune he had con&s;ider|able advantages over his fair relation, was over|joyed at the propo&s;al, and, communicating it to her father next morning, poor Mi&s;s Lambton re|ceived po&s;itive orders to prepare for Mr. Butler's vi&s;it that very afternoon.</P>
<P>MR. Butler came dre&s;&s;ed, and a finer figure perhaps was not to be found within the Bills of Mortality; he wanted but half an inch of &s;ix foot, and was made in a manner remarkably manly, without running into any thing unweildily clum&s;y, or awkwardly robu&s;t: his face was di&s;tingui&s;hed with a &s;et of &s;trong marking lines; each feature, to u&s;e the poet's expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>was expanded with &s;oul,</Q> and breathed the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;omewhat
<PB N="225" REF="240">
which di&s;covers the man of fa&s;hion at the fir&s;t glance; add to this, that there was &s;omething un|commonly intere&s;ting in his very tone of voice, which no le&s;s engaged the general attention, than commanded the univer&s;al re&s;pect: he came in a &s;uit of pompadour velvet, richly embroidered with &s;ilver, and &s;eemed as well calculated, in fact, to &s;ucceed with a fine lady, as the mo&s;t celebrated of his countrymen.</P>
<P>BEING left de&s;ignedly alone with Mi&s;s Lambton after tea time, he began in a very &s;en&s;ible and polite manner to make a declaration of his &s;enti|ments; but had &s;carcely uttered a &s;entence, when the young lady interrupted him, and begged his attention for a few words; he made a low bow; and &s;he addre&s;&s;ed him to the following purport: <Q>I am but too apprehen&s;ive, Sir, on what account I am honoured with this vi&s;it; my father, this morning, made me acquainted with your par|tiality in my favour; and, to be candid, from the little I have &s;een of you, I do not know a man in the world, was my heart di&s;engaged, who &s;hould &s;ooner command a place in my e&s;teem: But, Sir, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me ever to return your &s;entiments as you could wi&s;h; my affec|tions have for a con&s;iderable time been engro&s;&s;ed by a gentleman whom I have been many years acquainted with; and I &s;hould think it an un|pardonable injury to his tenderne&s;s, as well as to your worth, was I to keep this circum&s;tance a moment from your knowledge, after you have
<PB N="226" REF="241">
indicated the &s;malle&s;t degree of a particular re&s;pect.</Q></P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to gue&s;s Mr. Butler's a&s;toni&s;hment during this &s;peech; he blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively, played with his ruffles, and gave no other interruption than a <HI>Madam</HI> or two, pronounced with the &s;tronge&s;t empha&s;is of &s;urprize: Mi&s;s Lambton &s;eizing the opportunity which his &s;ilence afforded, thought it be&s;t to di&s;embo&s;em her&s;elf entirely, and thus went on:</P>
<P><Q>FROM the opinion which I entertain of your genero&s;ity, Mr. Butler, I flatter my&s;elf you will not u&s;e my father's authority, to tear me from the only man I ever can be happy with; nor make any attempts to gain a hand, which, on account of my prior attachment, can never be worthy of yours. Let me conjure you, therefore, dear Sir, to decline your addre&s;&s;es; and if you can have the additional goodne&s;s to give &s;uch a mea&s;ure any motive but this declaration; through my whole life I &s;hall be bound to wi&s;h you that felicity with &s;ome more de&s;erving woman, which it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould ever enjoy with me.</Q></P>
<P>I WILL not tre&s;pa&s;s upon the reader's patience with an account of what further pa&s;&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion: &s;uffice it, however, that Mr. Butler not only di&s;continued his addre&s;&s;es from that minute, but intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o effectually in favour of Mi&s;s Lambton, and her lover Mr. Seymour, that old Mr. Lambton gave his con&s;ent
<PB N="227" REF="242">
to their marriage, and Mr. Butler him&s;elf &s;tood godfather to a fine boy about ten months after.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of a few years, Mr. Seymour, by &s;ome lucky hits, accumulated a prodigious for|tune and died, leaving the &s;um of thirty thou&s;and pounds at the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of his lady; the re&s;t he divided among his children. Mrs. Seymour, who&s;e affection for her hu&s;band was uncommonly tender, did not long &s;urvive &s;o great a lo&s;s; &s;he fell into a langui&s;hing di&s;order that carried her off in about eighteen months, univer&s;ally regretted by all who had the plea&s;ure of her acquaintance: a little before her decea&s;e, however, &s;he made a &s;trict enquiry after Mr. Butler, of whom &s;he had not heard a &s;yllable for the &s;pace of &s;even years; &s;he at la&s;t found out that he had retired to the &s;outh of France upon an annuity of a hundred pounds, his fine e&s;tate having been entirely de&s;troyed, chiefly through the perfidy of his younger brother, for whom he had been bound in immen&s;e &s;ums, and &s;everal ineffectual &s;chemes to retrieve the &s;hattered &s;ituation of his affairs.</P>
<P>THE generous heart of Mrs. Seymour over|flowed with pity at his di&s;tre&s;s; his exalted conduct in relation to her and Mr. Seymour, ru&s;hed at once upon her recollection, and in her will, which &s;he ordered to be made without delay, &s;he in&s;erted this particular clau&s;e with her her own hand: <Q>I give and bequeath to the Hon. Charles Butler, the &s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds, on account of his great genero&s;ity in withdrawing his addre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s

when I was unmarried, and u&s;ing his good offices towards my union with my dear Mr. Seymour.</Q></P>
<P>THIS legacy was paid immediately after Mrs. Seymour's decea&s;e, and the &s;tory was la&s;t night told me by a gentleman of undoubted veracity, who received it him&s;elf from Mr. Butler.</P>

<HEAD>To The <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have kindly taken the poor Women under your protection, give me leave to com|plain, through your much-admired paper, of two young fellows, relations of my own indeed, who con&s;tantly vi&s;it at our hou&s;e: the fir&s;t, Sir, is a Templar, lately called to the bar, who thinks the e&s;&s;ence of every thing, either amiable or po|lite, is entirely confined to his profe&s;&s;ion, and is continually teazing us with pleas, replications, rejoinders, and demurrers: The other is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an independant fortune, and is what the un|thinking part of the world calls a man of the town, a per&s;on of great humour, and a keen &s;en&s;ible fel|low.</P>
<P>AS there are three or four girls of us generally together, and both Mr. Brief and Mr. Brazen are men of profe&s;&s;ed gallantry, they are always &s;ure of joining us at the tea-table, to make the be&s;t di&s;|play
<PB N="229" REF="244">
play of their re&s;pective abilities: yet, in&s;tead of conver&s;ing upon tho&s;e topics, which we can chear|fully join in, they talk continually on tho&s;e &s;ubjects which are either totally impo&s;&s;ible or utterly im|proper for us to under&s;tand. My cou&s;in Brief retails all the cau&s;es that are determined in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, with the mo&s;t in&s;ufferable minutene&s;s and in&s;ipidity; and, after he has taken up our atten|tion for two hours together, looks round with an air of &s;uch prodigious importance, that I have been often more provoked at this con&s;equential demand of our approbation for fatiguing us with his im|pertinence, than even with the impertinence it|&s;elf, though nothing can be &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting, con|temptible, and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>BUT what, if po&s;&s;ible, aggravates the error in this worthy cou&s;in of mine, is a cu&s;tom which he has of putting ca&s;es to us, and a&s;king us the meaning of Subpaena, Latitat, Capias, Certiorari, and a thou&s;and other technical terms in the law, which he con&s;iders as matters of the greate&s;t im|portance; and then, Sir, when he has entirely nonplu&s;&s;ed us, you would laugh to &s;ee how he plumes him&s;elf upon the triumph he has acquired, and with how &s;ignificant a wink he looks round on his friend Mr. Brazen, as much as to bid him ob&s;erve what a de&s;picable figure he has made of the fooli&s;h giddy-headed girls of the company.</P>
<P>MR. BRAZEN does not indeed take Mr. Brief's method of de&s;troying our patience, or in&s;ulting our under&s;tandings, with what we cannot compre|hend;
<PB N="230" REF="245">
for, on the contrary, Sir, he piques him|&s;elf upon being a remarkably plain &s;peaker, and will not he&s;itate to pronounce the mo&s;t apparent indelicacies in the mo&s;t offen&s;ive words: he looks upon it as frankne&s;s to be gro&s;s, and thinks it a certain &s;ign of wit to be unpardonably rude and unmannerly. He told my &s;i&s;ter Sally, no later than ye&s;terday, that &s;he was an ignorant little pu&s;s; and when I took him up for the familiarity, laughed directly in my face, and &s;aid I had a pro|digious deal of impudence. Then, Sir, he &s;wears &s;o horridly, he terrifies us to death; and &s;carcely mentions any thing without one of the&s;e &s;hocking execrations. From an opinion that indelicacy is a &s;ign of great &s;en&s;e, and a belief that it is very &s;pirited to be bla&s;phemous, he is continually &s;hew|ing his parts at the expence of common decency, and always making a parade of his courage, by flying in the face of his God! Many is the time, Sir, he has &s;ent me &s;inking with &s;hame out of the room, and made me &s;hudder with the earne&s;t pro|nounciation of &s;ome new-invented oath, which he has picked up in the licentious circle of his mi&s;er|able acquaintance.</P>
<P>I AM the more concerned, Mr. Babler, for this culpable conduct in my two cou&s;ins, becau&s;e they are both very hone&s;t, well-meaning, young fellows, and are far from being de&s;titute either of real be|nevolence or true genero&s;ity. I wi&s;h, therefore, Sir, you would tell them that nothing can be a greater in&s;ult to a woman's under&s;tanding, than to
<PB N="231" REF="246">
conver&s;e with her about matters with which it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould be acquainted; and that no|thing can be a gro&s;&s;er affront to the rectitude of her heart, than the iliberal practice of tho&s;e inde|cencies and execrations which are generally con|fined to the mo&s;t profligate of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>I AM far, very far, Mr. Babler, from preaching up an unnece&s;&s;ary preci&s;ene&s;s or &s;everity of behavi|our; on the contrary, I think freedom, while it is confined within the limits of good-breeding, one of the mo&s;t amiable e&s;&s;entials to the plea&s;ure of every rational company: But, Sir, where this free|dom infringes &s;o far upon the bounds of politene&s;s, that a woman is either treated as an idiot, or &s;ome|thing infinitely wor&s;e; that moment I think the man is entitled to the heavie&s;t cen&s;ure, who forgets the dignity of her &s;ex, and acts as if &s;he was utter|ly unworthy either of &s;en&s;ible conver&s;e, or common civility.</P>
<P>YOU men, Mr. Babler, are in general very &s;e|vere upon the women; you laugh at us for talking about our caps, our ribbands, or our lap-dogs; I would advi&s;e your lordly &s;ex, however, to look at home; and before they think of plucking the mote out of our eyes, to be pretty certain there are no beams in their own.</P>

<P>AS my fair corre&s;pondent Amanda's letter, in&s;erted in my la&s;t paper, has given, I am told, a general &s;atisfaction, it will not, I hope, be di&s;agreeable to my readers, if I re&s;ume the &s;ub|ject, e&s;pecially as I want to introduce a little jour|nal to their ob&s;ervation, which was lately pre&s;ent|ed to me with the papers of a decea&s;ed man of quality, who was unhappily a man of gallantry al&s;o; and indulged a licentiou&s;ne&s;s of thinking, in &s;ome ca&s;es, that reflected no great honour either upon his humanity or under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I HAVE frequently remarked what a degree of nicety is requi&s;ite in the education of young wo|men; and delivered it as my opinion, that tho&s;e parents were very fortunate, who, from the &s;ex of their children, had none of the various con&s;e|quences to apprehend, which the lea&s;t indi&s;cretion in the ladies is con&s;tantly &s;ure of bringing on a fa|mily. I have &s;aid that the &s;ame levity of conduct which would &s;teep a woman in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t lees of infamy, is entirely over looked, if not publicly approved, in a man; and that the mere circum|&s;tance of &s;ex gives him a kind of privilege to practi&s;e a number of irregularities, that would render an uncultivated female the &s;candal of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT at the &s;ame time that the depravity of cu&s;tom has given this unhappy &s;uperiority to the men; at
<PB N="233" REF="248">
the time that our lordly &s;ex is inve&s;ted by the world with a pre&s;criptive title of violating the mo&s;t &s;acred of the divine ordinances, neither rea&s;on nor religi|on has given us the lea&s;t exemption from undergo|ing that dreadful examination in another life, which is &s;o fatally di&s;regarded in this. When we &s;ee the mo&s;t triumphant libertine in his moments of illne&s;s, or his hours of reflexion, it is then we find that this boa&s;ted right of doing wrong is nothing more than a glittering gewgaw that leads us into a certain de|&s;truction, and ought to be lamented as the greate&s;t of all misfortunes, in&s;tead of being con&s;idered as a matter of con&s;olation, or looked upon with an eye of appetite or joy. To &s;peak in the language of the poet;
<Q><LG>
<L>When we behold him languidly oppre&s;t</L>
<L>On death's pale couch all gha&s;tly and declin'd</L>
<L>Or drag'd before the godhead of his brea&s;t,</L>

<HEAD>To the <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HERE &s;end you a remark or two upon a very celebrated performance, which in its particular walk of genius, has been mentioned as a ma&s;ter|piece; and po&s;&s;ibly produced more imitators than any other poem in this age and kingdom; I need &s;carcely tell you, Mr. Babler, that this piece is, "Gray's elegy in a country church-yard:" A piece, Sir, which though I much admire, I can by no means imagine to be &s;o extremely perfect a work, as it has been generally con&s;idered; and the fol|lowing are &s;ome of the rea&s;ons why I differ from the public opinion in this re&s;pect:</P>
<P>THE very fir&s;t line, Sir, which begins this elegy, is an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt at metaphor, palpably repugnant to the rules of poetry and univer&s;al ex|perience.</P>
<Q>The Curfeu tolls the knell of parting day,</Q>
<P>VISIBLY alluding to the ringing of a bell at the death of &s;ome-body. The author &s;hould have recollected, however, that this bell is never rung till &s;omebody is actually dead; and that therefore, the term <HI>parting</HI> is con&s;equently a fal&s;e metaphor; had he &s;aid indeed, that
<Q>The Curfeu tolls the knell of <HI>parted</HI> day,</Q>
<PB N="238" REF="253">
There could be no po&s;&s;ibility of objection, but <HI>parting</HI> is every whit as incongruous here as it would be in real life to toll a pa&s;&s;ing bell for a man, before he had po&s;itively given up the gho&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the reflective part, we come to the following &s;tanzas:
<Q><LG>
<L>Perhaps in this neglected &s;pot is laid,</L>
<L>Some heart once pregnant with coele&s;tial fire;</L>
<L>Hands which the reigns of empire might have &s;way'd,</L>
<L>And wak'd to ex&s;tacy, the living lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But knowledge to their eyes her ample page,</L>
<L>Rich with the &s;poils of time did ne'er unrol,</L>
<L>Chill Penury repre&s;s'd their noble rage,</L>
<L>And froze the genial current of their &s;oul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full many a gem of pure&s;t ray &s;erene,</L>
<L>The deep unfathom'd caves of ocean bear,</L>
<L>Full many a flow'r is born to blu&s;h un&s;een,</L>
<L>And wa&s;te it's &s;weetne&s;s in the de&s;ert air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some village Hampden, who with dauntle&s;s brea&s;t,</L>
<L>The little tyrants of his fields with&s;tood;</L>
<L>Some mute inglorious Milton here may re&s;t;</L>
<L>Some Cromwell guiltle&s;s of his country's blood.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>YOU &s;ee, Mr. Babler, notwith&s;tanding both the thought and ver&s;ification in tho&s;e &s;tanzas are extremely beautiful, yet there is a lap&s;e of no tri|fling nature in the execution. The author in the very moment that he intended to la&s;h Cromwell with the greate&s;t &s;everity, introduces him in the &s;ame company with Hampden and Milton, the ob|jects
<PB N="239" REF="254">
of his highe&s;t admiration; and laments in the &s;ame introductory pa&s;&s;age, that
<Q><L>Chill Penury repre&s;&s;ed his noble rage,</L>
<L>And froze the genial current of his &s;oul.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is odd that a <HI>noble</HI> rage &s;hould ever be a <HI>guilty</HI> one, and &s;omewhat &s;urprizing, that a per&s;on of our author's exten&s;ive abilities, could find no happier mode of conveying his cen&s;ure and his ap|plau&s;e: indeed in the two &s;ub&s;equent &s;tanzas, he has endeavoured to explain him&s;elf a little; but as Lady Townly aptly expre&s;&s;es it, it is nothing more than darning an old ruffle to make it the wor&s;e for mending.</P>
<LG>
<L>Th' applau&s;e of li&s;t'ning &s;enates to command</L>
<L>The threats of pain and ruin to de&s;pi&s;e,</L>
<L>To &s;catter plenty o'er a &s;miling land,</L>
<L>And read their hi&s;t'ry in a nation's eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their lot forbad; nor circum&s;crib'd alone</L>
<L>Their growing virtues; but their crimes confin'd,</L>
<L>Forbad to wade through &s;laughter to a throne,</L>
<L>And &s;hut the gates of mercy on mankind&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>HERE, Mr. Babler, in the &s;econd line of the la&s;t &s;tanza, Cromwell is allowed his &s;hare of virtue as well as Hampden or Milton; and they, in the pro|noun plural <HI>their,</HI> are dragged in for their &s;hare of vices as well as that celebrated u&s;urper: &s;o that upon the whole, though we gue&s;s the author's meaning well enough, the &s;tanzas are neverthele&s;s a &s;trange huddle of incon&s;i&s;tency, and not a little injurious to the per&s;picuity of their elegant author.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="255">In the epitaph we are told,
<Q><L>Here re&s;ts his head upon the lap of earth,</L>
<L>A youth to fortune and to fame unknown,</L>
<L>Fair &s;cience frown'd not on his humble birth</L>
<L>And melancholy mark'd him for her own.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>NOW for my own part, I can by no means &s;ee any merit in being marked out by melancholy for her own, though the conjunction <HI>"And,"</HI> at the beginning of the la&s;t line &s;eems to hint pretty &s;trongly, that melancholy is a nece&s;&s;ary concomit|ant of &s;cience. I &s;hall be bold enough to affirm, that if the word <HI>"But"</HI> was &s;ub&s;tituted for <HI>"And,"</HI> the reading would be much improved, and occa|&s;ion a much &s;tronger idea of tenderne&s;s, than what can po&s;&s;ibly be excited by the pre&s;ent word. The Epitaph was written on purpo&s;e to &s;pread a tender|ne&s;s through the mind of the reader; but the word <HI>"And,"</HI> making it as I &s;aid before, a matter of merit to be melancholy, the pa&s;&s;age naturally fails of it's intended effect; whereas had it been thus,
<Q><L>Fair &s;cience frown'd not on his humble birth,</L>
<L><HI>But</HI> melancholy mark'd him for her own,</L></Q>
We &s;hould have then lamented, that a worthy youth, enriched with the gifts of &s;cience, had the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on for de&s;pondency, and &s;hed a gene|rous tear in &s;ympathy with his misfortunes.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t &s;tanza, in my opinion, is either extreme|ly perplexed, or extremely indefen&s;ible.</P>
<Q><L>No farther &s;eek his merits to di&s;clo&s;e,</L>
<L>Nor draw his frailties from their dread abode,</L>
<L>(There they alike in trembling hope repo&s;e)</L>
<L>The bo&s;om of his Father and his God.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="241" REF="256">THIS &s;tanza, if it has any meaning at all, can mean nothing but this: <Q>That it is improper to examine either the merits or frailties of the per|&s;on decea&s;ed, &s;ince they are both alike repo&s;ed in one dread abode, the bo&s;om of his father and his God.</Q> This is the fir&s;t time I ever heard of a human creature making the bo&s;om of his Deity a repo&s;itory for his errors; and in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, I think the fault &s;till more inexcu&s;able, becau&s;e the violence offered to rea&s;on and religion, has no way a&s;&s;i&s;ted the poetry, this being perhaps as lame a pa&s;&s;age as any in the whole piece.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing cur&s;ory hints which I have thrown out with no ill-natured de&s;ign, Mr. Bab|ler, I hope your readers will &s;ee, there is a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of di&s;covering motes in the &s;un, and be a little cautious for the future, how they mention any thing as the criterion of merit, without fir&s;t of all making a candid enquiry, to &s;ee whether it has not &s;ome imperfections.</P>

<P>MY nephew Harry called on me this morning, and mentioned one of my papers which was prodigiou&s;ly commended by &s;everal of his acquaint|ance, particularly by Mi&s;s Cornelia Marchmont, who de&s;ired him, in very &s;trong terms, to give me her
<PB N="242" REF="257">
compliments for the ma&s;terly rules which I had there laid down for the &s;ervice of the ladies. I don't known how it was, but I received a con&s;i|derable &s;hare of &s;atisfaction from this compliment. Mi&s;s Marchmont is a young lady of twenty-one, mi&s;tre&s;s of every polite accompli&s;hment, and every &s;hining virtue; and carries in an exqui&s;ite &s;weetne&s;s of countenance, the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive indications of her fine under&s;tanding, and her excellent heart. My young rogue has, I fancy a month's mind to her; and if I am at all acquainted with the lan|guage of the eyes, Cornelia is no way di&s;plea&s;ed at that circum&s;tance. Harry as yet has told me nothing, but I believe it will be a match; if it &s;hould, I intend taking up my re&s;idence with them for the remainder of my days, and &s;hall leave my little all to them and their children.</P>
<P>THE reader may po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect, that I am more than commonly &s;en&s;ible of this young lady's merit, through a principle of vanity for the flat|tering encomium with which &s;he has favoured my productions. I &s;hall candidly acknowledge, that it made me &s;omewhat vain, but I hope I &s;hall be al&s;o believed, when I &s;ay, her complai&s;ance no way enhanced my opinion of her accompli&s;hments: and now I am talking of vanity, I cannot help ob&s;erving, how univer&s;ally &s;ubject the human mind is to the attacks of this dangerous enemy; for my own part, though an old fellow, when I have written any thing which I conceive may be u&s;eful, worthy,
<PB N="243" REF="258">
or done any thing which I fancy may be prai&s;e worthy, I &s;trut alone in my &s;tudy with a degree of con&s;equence &s;carcely credible; till recollecting how ridiculous a figure I make in the eye of my own examination, I blu&s;h at my &s;elf-&s;ufficienc, and immediately turn my thoughts upon &s;ome object which can be con&s;idered with a greater &s;hare of credit, both to my mode&s;ty and my under&s;tanding, &mdash; But to return &mdash;</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of Harry's conver&s;ation with me, he &s;aid, that Mi&s;s Marchmont had given him a letter for the u&s;e of the Babler, which &s;he re|que&s;ted might be in&s;erted in the pre&s;ent number. This letter, &s;ays Harry, &s;he lately wrote in an&s;wer to a very pa&s;&s;ionate epi&s;tle from a young fellow who has a company in the guards; and who, thinking her to be like the generality of the &s;ex, imagined a few fine expre&s;&s;ions and a red coat were &s;ufficient to render her in&s;en&s;ible to all the duties which &s;he owed to her&s;elf and her family.</P>

<P>YOU &s;et out with &s;aying, how tender an affection you have conceived for me, and what a very high opinion you entertain both of my heart and my under&s;tanding: &mdash; Upon my word, Sir, you have an uncommon &s;hare of penetration, for you were never in my company above half an hour in your days, and during that time you your&s;elf made &s;o con&s;picuous a figure in the con|ver&s;ation, that I had not an opportunity of &s;ay|ing twenty &s;yllables: to be &s;ure your &s;ub&s;equent entreaty is rather unhappy, when my amazing qualifications come to be con&s;idered; for the proof you de&s;ire me to give of a good di&s;po&s;ition, is to violate all the dignity and decorum of my &s;ex, by entering into a corre&s;pondence with an ab&s;olute &s;tranger; and the te&s;timony you want of my good &s;en&s;e, is to keep your delicate de|claration of love from the knowledge of the only people in the world to whom it ought to be fir&s;t of all revealed &mdash; my father and the re&s;t of my family.</P>
<P>IN the name of wonder, Sir, who are you, that you &s;hould pre&s;ume to think me capable either of &s;uch a meanne&s;s or &s;uch an ab&s;urdity.
<PB N="245" REF="260">
What mighty merit are you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, that you &s;hould imagine half a dozen lines are pow|erful enough to de&s;troy all the principles which I have been imbibing for the cour&s;e of a whole life; or what extraordinary obligations have you conferred upon me, that I mu&s;t, in an in&s;tant, &s;acrifice my own peace, and the tranquility of my family, for no other end, but that of grati|fying your inclinations?</P>
<P>O BUT you love me, and therefore gratitude &s;hould oblige me to return you a favourable an|&s;wer: admitting the po&s;&s;ibility even of &s;uch a circum&s;tance; pray, Sir, let me a&s;k you for who&s;e &s;ake do you love me, mine or your own? If it be for your own, of cour&s;e I am under no manner of obligation: and if it &s;hould turn out, as I am very much inclined to believe, that you do not love me, can th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e fine &s;peeches of yours, do you imagine, protect you from my hone&s;t in|dignation and contempt? Surely, if your pre|ten&s;ions were of a nature that merited any body's encouragement, there could be no occa&s;ion for this &s;ini&s;ter method of urging them. But I &s;ee through your ridiculous drift, Sir; you are po|&s;itive that your ful&s;ome declaration of a pa&s;&s;ion, will charm me into an utter di&s;regard for the &s;entiments of honour and filial affection; and render my con&s;ummate wi&s;dom&s;hip totally in|capable of acting with the lea&s;t degree of pru|dence or common under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="261">O BUT you mean honourably, and a&s;pire at the happine&s;s of my hand! a pretty method you take indeed of &s;oliciting my good opinion, by &s;uppo&s;ing me not only an undutiful daughter, but an ab&s;olute fool: be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, if I ever alter my condition, a father's approbation mu&s;t fir&s;t of all countenance my choice; and a perfect acquaintance with my lover's temper and prin|ciples confirm it. But to put an end at once to your &s;olicitations, give me leave to inform you, that it is by my father's command I write this letter; and that the di&s;ingenuous part you have acted on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, renders it utterly impo&s;&s;ible for you ever to obtain a favour|able &s;entiment either from him or from</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a con&s;tant reader of your paper, and am very often entertained with the ea&s;y and familiar manner in which, to u&s;e my lord Bacon's ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <Q>you bring home things to men's bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms.</Q> Some time ago I remember my|&s;elf particularly &s;truck with the journal of a liber|tine, and thought it an excellent way of la&s;hing the vices of our men of gallantry, who claim an indi&s;putable right of de&s;troying the happine&s;s of every family into which they are admitted. The mode of journalizing brought to my remembrance a little paper which I had written my&s;elf about &s;even years ago, and called the <Q>journal of an au|thor.</Q> At that time, Mr. Babler, &s;ome youthful indi&s;cretions deprived me of a father's protection, and I was reduced to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that of writing for bread; but whether I had too much pride or too little merit, or both, I &s;hall not take upon me to &s;ay; but my &s;ituation affected me &s;o much, that I once drew up the fol|lowing &s;tate of it for a week, and thought of in|&s;erting it in a magazine with which I happened to be connected. The printer, however, refu&s;ed it a place, and my father becoming reconciled to me in a little time after, it has &s;ince lain by, and is now at your &s;ervice for publication.</P>

<P>GREATLY as the degeneracy of the pre&s;ent age may be talked of, or highly &s;oever as we may imagine the people of antient times to &s;urpa&s;s us either in morality or under&s;tanding; I am ne|verthele&s;s perfectly &s;atisfied that there is as much good &s;en&s;e, and as much real virtue to be met with in our own days as ever was found in the days of our forefathers, notwith&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding the meritorious cobwebs of antiquity have happily concealed a number of their follies and their faults, and thrown a friendly veil of oblivion over no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of their imperfections.</P>
<P>THE writers of the pre&s;ent times are not indeed burthened with the mon&s;trous affectation which was &s;o commonly met with among the philo&s;ophers of antiquity, and therefore are probably held in a le&s;s con&s;equential light, both with regard to their principles and their abilities; this, however, if properly con&s;idered, is one rea&s;on why they may have a greater &s;hare of the latter, though it does not in the remote&s;t manner in&s;inuate an inference
<PB N="252" REF="267">
of their being any way inferior in the fir&s;t. Many of the antient Sages owed the greate&s;t part of their reputation to circum&s;tances which would entitle a modern to a dark room and a tru&s;s of &s;traw, or excite the general contempt at lea&s;t again&s;t his folly and impertinence: What would we think of a philo&s;opher now-a-days, if in&s;tead of arguing the world by the force of &s;ound rea&s;oning out of their vices and ab&s;urdities, he &s;hould be in continual tears about the former, and in a perpetual fit of laughing at the la&s;t? What would we &s;ay to any morali&s;t who would &s;earch the public &s;treets at noon with a candle and lanthorn, and tell every body he met, that he was endeavouring to find an hone&s;t man? Or what would we &s;ay to a Cynic, who by way of exhorting his countrymen again&s;t the allurements of luxury, would make u&s;e of no other per&s;ua&s;ives than bidding a total adieu to every &s;ocial enjoyment, and taking up his re&s;idence in a tub?</P>
<P>THE writers of a later date look with a ju&s;t di&s;|dain upon &s;uch de&s;picable in&s;tances of affectation, and do not addre&s;s them&s;elves to the weakne&s;s, but to the under&s;tanding of their countrymen: it is not the pa&s;&s;ions which they want to work upon, but the under&s;tanding which they want to con|vince; and are infinitely more &s;olicitous to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a re&s;pectable opinion of their judgment and their integrity, than ambitious to purcha&s;e an im|mortality by the practi&s;e of any illu&s;trious ab&s;urdi|ty, which however it may dazzle a moment upon
<PB N="253" REF="268">
the imagination, the cooler reflections of rea&s;on mu&s;t con&s;ider with the mo&s;t in&s;uperable contempt. Far be it from me to pluck the &s;malle&s;t bay from the brow of antiquity; I &s;incerely venerate many le&s;&s;ons inculcated by &s;everal of the philo&s;ophers; but at the &s;ame time I cannot be totally in&s;en&s;ible to the imperfections of their times, or palpably blind to the merits of our own: for this rea&s;on I mu&s;t &s;tand up for the character of modern under|&s;tanding, and declare it as my opinion, that I think no two philo&s;ophers in the whole compa&s;s of an|tiquity have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Bacon and Newton, either in the extent or importance of their works; and however I may incur the cen&s;ure of cla&s;&s;ical readers, I will go farther, and venture to a&s;&s;ert, that Shake|&s;pear and Milton are poets of as much excellence as either Homer or Virgil; and po&s;&s;ibly if the En|gli&s;h language was but half &s;o univer&s;ally &s;tudied as the Greek or Latin, I &s;hould find thou&s;ands who would not he&s;itate to give a more exalted forum of reputation to the two illu&s;trious moderns, than to the two celebrated names of antiquity, who have for &s;o many ages been con&s;idered as a &s;ort of <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> to human genius, in every performance of a poetical tendency.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;aid thus much in defence of modern under&s;tanding, I &s;hall &s;ay a few words in &s;upport of modern virtue again&s;t the heavy accu&s;ations of degeneracy, which &s;ome incon&s;iderate writers are but too apt to lay at our door, and but too ready to fa&s;ten on the credulity of the public.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="269">IT mu&s;t be readily granted, that the hi&s;tory of modern times affords &s;ufficient in&s;tances of vices, which reduce human nature to the ba&s;e&s;t of all levels, and throw the blacke&s;t &s;tigma not only upon the dignity, but upon the very name of man: yet if we take a review of more di&s;tant ages, we &s;hall find equal examples of rapine, perjury, and blood: The civilized &s;tates of Greece produced as many &s;cenes of ambition, tyranny, and murder, as can po&s;&s;ibly be found among the mo&s;t barbarous nations; and the virtuous Romans them&s;elves, at the very moment they were affecting an uncom|mon &s;anctity of manners, were robbing all the world to inculcate maxims of ju&s;tice, and cutting whole nations to pieces, to teach them le&s;&s;ons of benevolence and humanity. Greece had it's Phillip and it's Alexander, if France had her Louis the XIVth; and Rome had her Cae&s;ar, if England had her Cromwell &s;he al&s;o has a Caligula and a Nero to blacken everla&s;tingly upon her annals, if ours are &s;tigmatized with an arbitrary Charles, or a bi|gotted James: when I mention Louis the XIVth, I by no means de&s;ign to compare him with Philip or Alexander in any thing but his am|bition and his rapacity; they are in every other re&s;pect &s;o infinitely the more exalted murderers, that the &s;en&s;ible reader will readily perceive in this re&s;pect, I intended a very limited parallel.</P>
<P>SEEING therefore that the mo&s;t celebrated of the antient eras cannot produce greater poets and
<PB N="255" REF="270">
philo&s;ophers than what appears upon the modern li&s;t; I &s;hould be glad to a&s;k what rea&s;onable opinion can be a&s;&s;igned for our &s;uppo&s;ed depravity in un|der&s;tanding? And I &s;hould be al&s;o glad to know how the charge of a depravity in manners can be &s;upported, when upon a candid review of the an|tient annals, they appear to be covered with at lea&s;t an equal &s;hare of ab&s;urdities and crimes: that the modern era is bad enough, we have too many lamentable te&s;timonies; but there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity to aggravate either our weakne&s;s or our guilt, by making us wor&s;e than former times, which wherever we examine, were, in the general, a compound of the greate&s;t villains and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fools.</P>

<P>WHEN the celebrated Voltaire was in Eng|land, he paid a vi&s;it to the famous Mr. Congreve, though he was utterly unacquainted with him, and with that happy violation of cere|mony which is the characteri&s;tic of elevated genius, introduced him&s;elf upon the mere account of their re&s;pective literary reputations. The Engli&s;hman was, however, di&s;concerted, and in&s;tead of looking upon the frankne&s;s of Voltaire's behaviour as the greate&s;t compliment that could be paid him; he &s;aid, he would be glad of being vi&s;ited by Mr. Voltaire as a private gentleman, but could not think of cultivating a friend&s;hip with any body,
<PB N="256" REF="271">
barely on the account of being an author. The Frenchman, di&s;gu&s;ted at this untimely in&s;tance of affectation, turned upon his heel, and replied, with &s;everity, that had not Mr. Congreve been &s;ome|what more than a private gentleman, he never would have &s;uffered the trouble of that inter|view.</P>
<P>THE &s;lighte&s;t &s;urvey of mankind will convince a rational enquirer, that the generality of people are influenced by as injudicious a principle in their actions, as Mr. Congreve in the pre&s;ent circum|&s;tance. To avoid the imputation of one extre|mity, they in&s;en&s;ibly run into another; and let the character be what it will which they are fearful of incurring, an exce&s;&s;ive &s;olicitude to avoid it, ex|po&s;es them frequently to one equally ab&s;urd, and excites, while they imagine them&s;elves perfectly &s;ecure from ridicule or cen&s;ure, the univer&s;al laugh or di&s;e&s;teem of their acquaintance. I am naturally led into the&s;e reflexions by a letter from a corre&s;|pondent, who&s;e favours I &s;hall be always proud of receiving, and who&s;e good opinion I &s;hall always &s;tudy to de&s;erve, while my lei&s;ure and my inclina|tion allow me to &s;cribble for the amu&s;ement of the public.</P>

employed in the decoration of their per&s;ons: yet for my own part, I think the eternal &s;loven to the full as contemptible a character as the coxcomb profe&s;&s;ed; nay, if po&s;&s;ible, I con&s;ider him as the wor&s;t of the two, &s;ince though the latter may pro|voke your mirth, he does not turn your &s;tomach; and is at mo&s;t but an object of laughter, without giving any occa&s;ion for di&s;gu&s;t. I lately &s;pent a few weeks near Whitehaven, in Cumberland, Mr. Babler, where I had frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing with a very worthy Clergyman, who formerly was my &s;chool-ma&s;ter, and who has as good a heart and as clear an under&s;tanding as any man in the kingdom. As we kept company on the mo&s;t unre&s;erved terms of friend&s;hip, my powdered head of hair and white coat was a continual &s;ource of entertainment to him; and he would often call me a young coxcomb, if in walking through a wet field or a dirty road, I &s;eemed to take the &s;malle&s;t pains about my &s;tockings, or expre&s;&s;ed a ca&s;ual wi&s;h that I had not come abroad without my boots. A very trifling concern about the ac|cumulating &s;ablene&s;s of a &s;hirt, would procure me a lecture of half an hour, and a clean handkerchief once a day, was a piece of unpardonable foppery that merited the di&s;cipline of a hor&s;ewhip. In &s;hort, Sir, being barely decent in my externals, was &s;ure of drawing an imputation upon the little &s;hare of under&s;tanding I po&s;&s;e&s;s; and in proportion as I was tolerably dre&s;&s;ed, I was certain of being told I had an intolerable degree of vanity.</P>

<P><PB N="258" REF="275">THE good-humoured liberties thus taken with my appearance, I con&s;tantly retorted upon my reverend friend for running into the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able negligence imaginable. If my powdered head and &s;mooth chin afforded him a laugh, I was no le&s;s merry with his antiquated grizzel and long beard; and for every &s;arca&s;m thrown out again&s;t my white cotton &s;tockings, I never failed to be witty on his coar&s;e yarn ones, which through an ab&s;olute piece of affectation; he continually wore half way about his heels. In this manner we u&s;ed to joke when at a lo&s;s for conver&s;ation; and it ge|nerally proved a matter of no little entertainment to the hone&s;t country people, to hear us rating one another &s;o heartily.</P>
<P>THIS perpetual negligence in the appearance of my worthy friend, very often led me to reflect upon the motive which could induce &s;o many people of excellent under&s;tandings to be &s;o ex|tremely regardle&s;s of their per&s;ons; and I never could imagine but what it was &s;ome &s;trange kind of vanity, which in general produced this unaccount|able &s;lovenline&s;s, notwith&s;tanding to avoid every imputation of vanity, is the univer&s;al plea of all the &s;lovens of my acquaintance: looking upon any remarkable attachment to dre&s;s, as a proof of a weak mind, your men of &s;en&s;e affect to be entirely above it; and willing to enhance their own con|&s;equence, by depending &s;olely on the force of in|tellectual merit, they run to &s;tudied indecencies of appearance; and very often carry not only a dirty

<P>PEOPLE of &s;en&s;e &s;hould, however, con&s;ider, that a cleanline&s;s in dre&s;s is not a little conducive to health; and that it can be no derogation from their under&s;tandings, to make u&s;e of an occa&s;ional ba&s;on of water in the &s;cowering of their hands and face: all extremes are an imputation upon our judg|ments; and the be&s;t proof which men of abilities can give of their &s;uperior wi&s;dom on ordinary oc|ca&s;ions, is to avoid the &s;malle&s;t appearance of &s;in|gularity. Wherever we &s;ee men running into &s;in|gularities of any kind, we may &s;afely conclude, that the judgment is not perfectly right; but when we &s;ee the&s;e &s;ingularities have a tendency only to occa&s;ion univer&s;al di&s;gu&s;t, we may be &s;atisfied, that whoever is guilty of them, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an un|common &s;hare of pride at the bottom; and thinks that the accompli&s;hments of his mind &s;ufficiently attone for any egregious di&s;regard of his per&s;on.</P>

<P>THOUGH no man can be a greater ad|mirer of Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality than my&s;elf. I have neverthele&s;s been frequently offended at &s;eeing this ho&s;pitality carried to a ridiculous exce&s;s; and have always imagined where I &s;aw the ma&s;ter of a hou&s;e running into a large expence merely for the entertainment of two or three intimate friends, that he mu&s;t entertain either a very improper opi|nion of him&s;elf, or a &s;trange idea of his company.</P>
<P>I DINED ye&s;terday with my old friend Ned Grumble, the council at Gray's-inn, with whom I went to &s;chool, and who notwith&s;tanding the &s;mart air which an occa&s;ional queue wig gives him is at lea&s;t eight and fifty, and ought to know a little more of the world than what he manife&s;ted in his entertainment. There were but three of us, Ned, Dr. Sy&s;tem the Naturali&s;t, and my&s;elf, yet we had dinner enough from the tavern to &s;erve twenty, and &s;uch a profu&s;ion of luxuries, that the bare eatables mu&s;t at lea&s;t have amounted to &s;ix or &s;even pounds. To be &s;ure Ned is a man of fortune,
<PB N="261" REF="278">
and can afford to treat his friends very genteelly, but for my own part I never form my notions of gentility by the &s;tandard of extravagance. I don't love to &s;ee money unnece&s;&s;arily thrown away; and always wi&s;h that people of condition would apply the &s;uperfluities of their income either to the relief of merit in di&s;tre&s;s, or to tho&s;e objects which mu&s;t promote the general welfare of their country.</P>
<P>As the various cour&s;es came in, I ob&s;erved Ned was &s;ecretly plea&s;ed with the air of &s;urprize which I naturally put on, and &s;eemed to ri&s;e in his own opinion in proportion to the elegance of his table; with a look of indifference he pre&s;&s;ed the doctor and I to eat hearty; and with a very ridiculous kind of an affectation, lamented that there was no|thing which we could po&s;&s;ibly like. He wi&s;hed the dinner had been to our ta&s;tes; and with the long li&s;t of cu&s;tomary excu&s;es which u&s;ually pa&s;s for good breeding in &s;econd-rate companies, he promi&s;ed the next time we favoured him with a vi&s;it, we &s;hould be accommodated in a manner in|finitely more to our &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>WHEN I returned home I could not help re|flecting on the pernicious prevalence of cu&s;toms in the generality of our convivial entertainments. The eternal endeavour at parade and magnificence, I con&s;idered as the natural re&s;ult of vanity; and &s;aw, that by much the principal part of the world, was con&s;iderably more &s;tudious to arrogate the opinion of their own importance, than to promote the &s;atisfaction of their friends. Every di&s;h which
<PB N="262" REF="279">
was added to a table, I found was looked upon as an addition to the merit of the entertainer; and he that was a clever fellow with a Turbot, was &s;till clever if he could furni&s;h a John Dory, or provide any other article of luxury equally ex|pen&s;ive and unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If, however, we examine this matter properly we &s;hall always find, that an exce&s;s of preparation, in&s;tead of being a real compliment, is nothing better than indirect offence; it is a tacit in&s;inuation either that our gue&s;ts are not generaly u&s;ed to &s;uch delicacies as we have provided for them, or that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to bribe the depravity of their pallates, when we would de&s;ire the favour of their company. The great art of entertaining with elegance is to entertain with rea&s;on. To do this we mu&s;t con&s;ult the nature of our circum|&s;tances, and the rank of our friends. If the fir&s;t are narrow, we expo&s;e our&s;elves to the &s;e|vere&s;t cen&s;ure as well as the keene&s;t ridicule, by aping the luxurious abundance of a Lord Mayor's table; and let the latter be what will, we &s;hould endeavour to treat them after the cu&s;tomary manner in which they treat them&s;elves in their own families. For this rea&s;on we &s;hould never in&s;ult a poor man with all the magnificence of fifty covers, nor invite a lord to an humble &s;hin of beef. A decent &s;upply of good di&s;hes &s;hould always be in readine&s;s, but nothing ever &s;tudied for unnece&s;&s;ary parade. Plenty and not profu&s;ion &s;hould be the characteri&s;tic of our board; and we &s;hould con&s;tantly recollect that tho&s;e are utterly
<PB N="263" REF="280">
unworthy the appellation of friends, who could wi&s;h us to &s;quander a parced of valuable pounds for the mere &s;ake of making an empty di&s;play of our opulence, when the &s;um thus extravagantly laid out, might be applied to a number of very &s;alutary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal people, however, who are hurried away by an unaccountable de&s;ire of ap|pearing extremely &s;plendid in their entertainments, and make it a &s;ort of point to keep a table con&s;i|derably above their circum&s;tances. I remember poor dick Thornton would frequently invite peo|ple to dinner, and treat with Champagne and Bur|gundy, though he borrowed the money which paid the bill of fare, but the evening before, from &s;ome of his gue&s;ts, or pitifully begged a fortnight's credit at the Mitre in Fleet-&s;treet.</P>
<P>HOSPITALITY to be &s;ure requires every man to receive his acquaintance with the utmo&s;t cordiality and warmth, but it by no means de&s;ires people of &s;mall fortune to be con&s;tantly impoveri&s;hing them|&s;elves for the &s;ake of keeping an exten&s;ive circuit of company; neither does it dictate, that tho&s;e with full pur&s;es &s;hould ever run into extravagance. None, however, mi&s;take the matter more than young fellows who are ju&s;t entering in the world, and have no other pro&s;pect of &s;upporting them|&s;elves, than the &s;ucce&s;s of their re&s;pective avoca|tions. Betrayed by too great a genero&s;ity of tem|per, they imagine they never can &s;hew a &s;ufficient welcome to their friends; and hence they incon|&s;iderately
<PB N="264" REF="281">
provide twenty or thirty di&s;hes for tho&s;e very men, who&s;e general round of living they know to be a plain &s;imple joint, or a frugal beef &s;take at a Tavern. For my own part, whenever it has been my lot to dine with per&s;ons of this ca&s;t, the uncommon excellence of my entertainment has entirely &s;poiled my &s;tomach; and I have lo&s;t all reli&s;h to eating, merely from recollecting what a con&s;iderable &s;um a good-natured young fellow mu&s;t have idly thrown away, through a de&s;ire of mani|fe&s;ting an extraordinary re&s;pect for his company.</P>
<P>THE publication of this little &s;tricture, will, I hope, in &s;ome mea&s;ure remove &s;o great an ab&s;ur|dity. People of good &s;en&s;e want little more than a bare mention of their errors, to produce an amend|ment; and by the reformation which I may hear occa&s;ioned by the pre&s;ent hint, I &s;hall immediately judge the under&s;tanding of my readers.</P>

<P>IN the cour&s;e of my little &s;trictures I have fre|quently endeavoured to di&s;countenance the &s;can|dalous propen&s;ity which I have ob&s;erved in a num|ber of old fellows, for an ob&s;cenity of conver&s;a|tion; a propen&s;ity which even in the thoughtle&s;s and giddy-headed &s;tate of youth is extremely cul|pable, and no l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s di&s;graces the politene&s;s of the gentleman, than le&s;&s;ens the under&s;tanding of the
<PB N="265" REF="282">
man. In the pre&s;ent paper I &s;hall lay a picture before my readers, which though really drawn for a particular per&s;on, will, I fear, prove much too general a re&s;emblance; but which if it &s;hould for|tunately prove a means of reforming a &s;ingle indi|vidual, will make me think my time very well be|&s;towed and induce me perhaps to take up the &s;ub|ject again at another opportunity.</P>
<P>LAST night having received a mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing in|vitation from an old relation of mine, I went and &s;upped at his hou&s;e. The company con&s;i&s;ted of his lady, his &s;on, and his two daughters, a very eminent clergymen in the city, and my&s;elf. My friend is one of tho&s;e people, who having formerly cut a very gay figure in the world, is &s;till ambi|tious of &s;preading the May-bloom of twenty-five upon the winter of three&s;core; and de&s;irous of di&s;|playing in the fulne&s;s of his &s;pirits, that &s;pright|line&s;s and vivacity which time has relentle&s;sly taken from his per&s;on: with this view he is everla&s;tingly aiming at double entendres, and will not even he&s;itate to crack his indelicate ambiguities upon his children. On the contrary, he often attacks his daughters with a vein of the mo&s;t culpable levity, and tells them, when the poor young ladies are ready to &s;ink with &s;hame and mortification, that they know very well what he means, and that he is perfectly &s;en&s;ible they are both langui&s;hing for hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>AS my old friend &s;uffers me to take more liber|ties with him than he can bear from any body
<PB N="266" REF="283">
el&s;e, I always endeavour to keep him in a little or|der; and this renders my vi&s;its uncommonly wel|come to his family. La&s;t night I managed him pretty well, and we had not above ten or a dozen indelicacies during &s;upper time: but the cloth was no &s;ooner removed, than he cried, <Q>come, Mr. Babler, I'll give you a toa&s;t;</Q> this was what the ladies extremely apprehended, and they all in&s;tantly ro&s;e up from table, with an abruptne&s;s that would have a&s;toni&s;hed a &s;tranger prodigiou&s;ly, and darted out of the room: upon this he bur&s;t into a loud laugh, and &s;lapping me on the &s;houlder with an air of extraordinary &s;atisfaction, exclaimed, <Q>Well, my boy, you &s;ee I am &s;till old Truepenny, and though to the full as heavily laden with years as your&s;elf, have fifty times your &s;pirits, and can &s;et the women a going whenever I think proper.</Q> Then turning round to the clergyman, and pointing to his &s;on, he a&s;ked, with an arch &s;ignificance of countenance, <Q>Do you think, doctor, that fellow will be a quarter the man I am when he comes to my age &mdash; hey &mdash; what &s;ay you petticoats.</Q> The gentleman replied, he believed not; and my friend ordered us to fill a bumper directly, for he &s;till piques him&s;elf upon being able to drink a couple of bottles of an even|ing.</P>
<P>WHEN our gla&s;&s;es were charged, <Q>Now, (&s;ays he) I'll give you a toa&s;t:</Q> he did &s;o with a witne&s;s; and totally forgetting the pre&s;ence of his &s;on, the profe&s;&s;ion of the clergyman, and the &s;obriety of my
<PB N="267" REF="284">
character, gave what would &s;carcely have i&s;&s;ued from the underbred intoxication of an Iri&s;h chair|man in a night cellar. For my own part, I turned round in di&s;gu&s;t, the clergyman wiped his face, and the &s;on &s;tooped to buckle his &s;hoe, in order to avoid the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of blu&s;hing for his father, who&s;e behaviour was no le&s;s ill-timed than it was illiberal. I was in hopes the vi&s;ible di&s;&s;a|tisfaction which we all manife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion, would have kept my antiquated buck in a little order for the remainder of the evening: but here, Sir, I was mi&s;erably mi&s;taken; every gla&s;s brought on a new in&s;tance of ob&s;cenity, and produced a fre&s;h que&s;tion, whether he was not the heartie&s;t cock, of his years, in the univer&s;e. The lowe&s;t amours of his youthful days were raked up with the mo&s;t paltry degree of o&s;tentation; and he &s;eemed to gain a new &s;hare of life from the mere repetition of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which &s;hould have made him &s;orry that he ever lived at all.</P>
<P>YOUTH is but a poor excu&s;e for a man's playing the fool; but no palliation can po&s;&s;ibly be offered, where a grey head is &s;triving to re-exi&s;t in the remembrance of former vices, and is ambitious of pre&s;erving the &s;ame reputation for extravagancies in the deepening vale of years, which rendered him contemptible to the thinking part of the world when a boy of nineteen. If a man is really de|&s;irous of being re&s;pected in the decline of life, he mu&s;t act in &s;uch a manner as to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> the uni|ver&s;al e&s;teem of his acquaintance; in&s;tead of de|viating
<PB N="268" REF="285">
into ribaldry, he mu&s;t make an ab&s;olute di&s;play of his good &s;en&s;e, and build his applau&s;e upon the rectitude of his own &s;entiments, in&s;tead of applying to the depravity of ours. A debauchee of &s;ixty is no le&s;s a &s;candal to nature, than a di&s;|grace to morality; and we cannot help feeling a &s;ecret kind of horror, when we &s;ee a father pro|fligately je&s;ting with his children, and taking every opportunity to &s;teel them again&s;t the nicer &s;en&s;a|tions of delicacy and virtue. The parent who acts in this manner has not only his own errors to an&s;wer for, but in a great mea&s;ure the crimes of his po&s;terity. The human mind has a natural promptitude to err, and we are all of us but too fond of copying the examples of tho&s;e whom we have been taught to reverence and love. For the &s;ake of the ri&s;ing generation, therefore, let me earne&s;tly exhort the <HI>old hearty cocks</HI> of the pre&s;ent age, to pay &s;ome little regard to this reflexion; &s;ince the reputation and welfare of their families ought to engage a con&s;iderable &s;hare of their at|tention, however indifferent they may be about their own.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING a number of writers have very judiciou&s;ly employed their pens in expo&s;ing the ridiculous partiality which the generality of parents feel in favour of their
<PB N="269" REF="286">
own children; yet there is one &s;pecies of this par|tiality which, though the mo&s;t fatal in it's effects, has however engaged but the &s;malle&s;t part of their notice; for which rea&s;on I propo&s;e to make it the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and flatter my&s;elf that it will be received on account of it's import|ance with a particular &s;hare of indulgence by the public.</P>
<P>THE prejudice upon which I intend to animad|vert, is the opinion ab&s;urdly entertained by every body, that the beauty of their daughters will be always certain of making their fortunes. This unhappy prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is now &s;o univer&s;ally adopted that few parents attend to more than the mere &s;uperficials of a young lady's education; a mother now-a-days, in&s;tead of inculcating le&s;&s;ons of pru|dence and morality, is only &s;olicitous about the per&s;onal accompli&s;hments of her ri&s;ing angel: in|&s;tead of teaching her to be humble, mode&s;t, and unaffected, &s;he lays down no rules but tho&s;e of pride; no precepts but tho&s;e of arrogance, and no documents but tho&s;e of affectation. Before Mi&s;s is out of her hanging &s;leeves, &s;he is accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t extravagant prai&s;es of her own beauty, and is in&s;tructed in a belief, that &s;o the delicacy of her complexion is attended to, there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity what&s;oever to pay the lea&s;t regard to the cultivation of her mind. Hence &s;he can argue upon the excellence of Naples dew, before &s;he knows a &s;ingle commandment in the decalogue; and de&s;cant upon the &s;martne&s;s of a ribband, be|fore
<PB N="270" REF="287">
&s;he is acquainted with a letter in the al|phabet.</P>
<P>THE natural con&s;equence of &s;uch an education is, that &s;he becomes intollerably vain, and in &s;up|portably ignorant. The fir&s;t of the&s;e amiable qua|lifications, her vanity, renders her totally blind to every merit in the character of another per&s;on; and the latter, renders her as totally in&s;en&s;ible of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdity in her own. Calculated merely for &s;hew, her only &s;tudy is to attract a croud of fools to the &s;tandard of her beauty; and taught that a woman with &s;o ex|qui&s;ite a face, has a ju&s;t preten&s;ion to the fir&s;t offers in the kingdom, &s;he is continually a&s;piring above the level of her circum&s;tances. By this means &s;he mo&s;t commonly withers in contempt upon the &s;talk of an antiquated virginity, or &s;acrifices her reputation to &s;ome debauchee of fa&s;hion, whom &s;he vainly imagines to draw in for a hu&s;band. It is below a beauty ever to think of marrying with a man of her own rank: her charms are to procure &s;omething infinitely &s;uperior; and there is &s;carcely a trade&s;man's daughter with a pa&s;&s;able face, in the weekly bills, but what now and then thinks of an equipage with a tollerable degree of confidence; and imagines her&s;elf pretty certain at lea&s;t of a gentleman or a knight, though &s;he &s;hould even fail of gaining a helpmate with a coronet.</P>
<P>THE &s;trange&s;t thing, however, in this unac|countable notion with which people are deluded, of a daughter's making a fortune with her face,
<PB N="271" REF="288">
is, that every one &s;uppo&s;es the world will look through the magnifying gla&s;s of parental prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and conceive ju&s;t &s;uch an opinion of the girl's per&s;onal attractions, as they are &s;illy enough to entertain them&s;elves, without ever recollecting that others have no natural intere&s;t in the young lady, either to be blind to her defects, or &s;en&s;ible of her perfections; they are a&s;toni&s;hed that we &s;hould differ from their idea of her merit; and ab|&s;olutely demand that tribute of admiration from our ju&s;tice, which is nothing but the ridiculous re|&s;ult of their own partiality.</P>
<P>How often, I appeal to my readers, have they heard a mother extolling the face of &s;ome half-begotten thing to the &s;kies, as a miracle of ex|cellence, and, in the fulne&s;s of her heart, exclaim|ing, <HI>my beauty, my queen, and my angel,</HI> where the poor little wretch had actually the features of a jacknapes. For my own part, I have &s;een &s;uch things a thou&s;and times, and among my own rela|tions too. My cou&s;in Suke has a little girl of about ten years old, who is blind of an eye, and &s;eamed with the &s;mall pox, like a Savoy-cabbage; yet Suke imagines that her daughter will, one time or other, make a conque&s;t of a nobleman; and has been known to prai&s;e the ineffable &s;weetne&s;s of her Patty's face, though the company were at that very moment talking about lady Sarah Bun|bury, or the duche&s;s of Hamilton.</P>
<P>WERE parents, however, to act with prudence, they might ea&s;ily judge from what they them&s;elves
<PB N="272" REF="289">
think of other peoples' children, how other people are affected at the &s;ight of theirs. This &s;ingle mode of judging would, in a moment, unbind the charm which fa&s;cinates the heart of &s;o many fathers and mothers, and convince them that there were a number of requi&s;ites nece&s;&s;ary to form a complete woman, be&s;ides the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mooth face, and an agreeable per&s;on: they would then &s;ee, that a well-cultivated mind had an infinite &s;upe|riority over the mo&s;t ro&s;y cheek in the univer&s;e; and di&s;cover that &s;omething more than a bare knowledge in fixing a head-dre&s;s, or pinning a handkerchief, was indi&s;pen&s;ibly proper for the mi&s;|tre&s;s of a family.</P>
<P>IN fact, the men are not &s;uch fools as they may be generally imagined. A young fellow, if he wants to make an occa&s;ional connexion with a lady, &s;carcely ever looks for more than figure or make. By the &s;ame rule that he buys a hor&s;e, he choo&s;es his mi&s;tre&s;s: but the ca&s;e is widely diffe|rent, when he comes to think of a wi&s;e. However he may laugh at prudence and di&s;cretion in him|&s;elf, he always requires it in her; and thinks he is infinitely more liable to &s;uffer in the public opinion, through the minute&s;t foible of her's, than through the greate&s;t error of his own: for this rea&s;on, the wilde&s;t libertine, when he thinks of marrying, generally looks out for a woman of virtue and under&s;tanding. Experience has taught him how &s;mall a &s;hare the mere attractions of a fine face have in the formation of real happine&s;s;
<PB N="273" REF="290">
and if he even choo&s;es a per&s;on that <HI>wants</HI> a fortune, yet his choice is mo&s;t commonly a per&s;on that can <HI>&s;ave</HI> one. Hence matrimony is the only thing in which he &s;eldom &s;uffers him&s;elf to be duped, and he hardly ever dreams of a&s;king the hand of a mere beauty, while there is a po&s;&s;ibility for him to gain a woman of real beauty and merit too.</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;trictures in your la&s;t paper, on the ri|diculous propen&s;ity which the generality of people have to &s;uppo&s;e the beauty of their daughters will at any time be &s;ufficient to make their for|tunes, are &s;o very much in point, that I cannot re|&s;i&s;t a de&s;ire of troubling you with my little &s;tory, e&s;pecially as it may perhaps be a means of prevent|ing &s;ome other parents from following the unhappy example of my poor father and mother, who&s;e ill-judged tenderne&s;s in this re&s;pect was the original &s;ource of all my misfortunes.</P>
<P>MY father you mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, was the younge&s;t &s;on of a good family, but had, how|ever, no other dependance than an employment under the government, which brought him in about five hundred pounds a year. As he was naturally of a generous di&s;po&s;ition, he never thought of
<PB N="274" REF="291">
mending his circum&s;tances by marrying a woman with money, though he had a per&s;on and an ad|dre&s;s which rendered it no way difficult for him to &s;ucceed with the ladies. On the contrary, Sir, he followed the implicit direction of his in|clinations; and before he was five and twenty, married my mother, the daughter of a Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire baronet, who&s;e whole fortune con&s;i&s;ted of a long line of ance&s;tors, a high notion of gentility, and a very agreeable face.</P>
<P>WITH a di&s;po&s;ition on both &s;ides to make every thing wear the mo&s;t elegant appearance, it is not to be wondered at, if on either, there were no ex|traordinary notions of oeconomy. I was born in about a twelvemonth after their union; and I have heard my mother &s;ay, the bare preparations for her lying in, amounted to near a hundred and fifty pounds. Being the only product of their affections, I was treated as if I was &s;omething more than mortal. In my earlie&s;t infancy I was di&s;covered to have &s;ome irre&s;i&s;tible attractions. My mother, before my eyes were well open, declared them a pair of the tight killing kind; and if I happened but to cry for a little bread and milk, my father found out in every &s;quall &s;ome indications of a won|derful &s;agacity. In &s;hort, I was looked upon as an ab&s;olute <HI>Olio or &s;almongundy of perfections,</HI> to u&s;e the words of a fa&s;hionable author, and was almo&s;t in dan|ger of being devoured, through the <HI>in&s;atiable</HI> fond|ne&s;s as I may call it, of my poor father and mother.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="292">WHEN I grew towards &s;even or eight, and had pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of a fiery &s;mall-pox with pretty good &s;ucce&s;s, I was pronounced a perfect beauty; and my friends all concluded, that it was impo&s;&s;ible but what &s;uch a woman as I promi&s;ed to turn out, mu&s;t make her fortune by her per&s;onal attractions. Infatuated by this unaccountable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, my mother's &s;ole attention was confined to tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments which were rather engaging than nece&s;&s;ary, and rendered a woman &s;uperficially agreeable, without being of any intrin&s;ic u&s;e. Thus, Sir, when other girls of my age were ad|vancing pretty fa&s;t in the progre&s;s of French, Italian, and Engli&s;h authors, I was &s;tudying how to play at quadrille, or exerci&s;ing the whole army of my little graces before the looking gla&s;s. In&s;tead of growing a mi&s;tre&s;s at my needle, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to make up the linnen of the family, I was in&s;tructed to laugh at indu&s;try, and told, that poring on a piece of work would inevitably injure my eyes, or endanger my con&s;titution. Going to church they as good as told me, was extremely vulgar, and it was hinted that I &s;hould &s;hew my &s;pirit by taking care to rate the &s;ervants very &s;oundly, whenever they grew either familiar or impertinent. In &s;hort, Sir, in this hopeful manner I reached my &s;ixteenth year, and knew nothing in nature but how to make a cap, play a game at cards, turn out my toes a little tollerably, and play a le&s;&s;on or two on the harp&s;ichord.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="293">AS I was now bordering on the age when my mother expected my per&s;on would work miracles, &s;he took uncommon pains to tell me, that tho&s;e who were my equals only were infinitely beneath me; and that none but tho&s;e who were con&s;i|derably my &s;uperiors, could po&s;&s;ibly be as good as my&s;elf &mdash; Vanity and indi&s;cretion, the characte|ri&s;tics of my years, were open to every document of this nature; and I looked upon it as a deroga|tion from my con&s;equence, to be &s;een in le&s;s than honourable company. For this purpo&s;e I even con|de&s;cended to be treated with indifference; put up with an in&s;ult from the daughter of a man of fa&s;hion, for the &s;ake of numbering her among&s;t my acquaintance; and permitted &s;ome familiarities, not criminal however, from her brother, to pur|cha&s;e the honour of his attending on me in public. &mdash; The con&s;equence of this behaviour was, how|ever fatal: &mdash; Before I was eighteen, I refu&s;ed two or three very con&s;iderable offers from people of my own rank; and before I was nineteen, fell a victim to the illiberal machinations of a villain with an earldom, who vi&s;ited on my account at my father's, and flattered him with a notion of &s;pedily becoming my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>NOT to dwell upon this unhappy circum&s;tance, &s;uffice it, that &s;hame and di&s;appointment quickly broke the heart of my poor father, who died, la|menting with his la&s;t breath his error in my edu|cation, and was followed by his mi&s;erable relict in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks. With my father died all my
<PB N="277" REF="294">
hopes of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and what I &s;hould have done for bread God only knows, had not a mo&s;t excel|lent lady, who was compelled into a marriage with my betrayer, a little after I was undone by him, purcha&s;ed me out of her pin-money an annuity of a hundred pounds for my life, and generou&s;ly &s;ent it me in a manner that doubled the obligation. Upon this I have re&s;ided near ten years in a remote part of the country, endeavouring, by a clo&s;e ap|plication to the be&s;t authors, to unlearn the prin|cipal part of what I was formerly taught; and to attone by an exemplary conduct, during the re|mainder of my days, for the indi&s;cretions of my pa&s;t behaviour. May my &s;tory prove a means of preventing the ruin of other young women; and teach &s;uch parents as mine, that the only way of rai&s;ing a real happine&s;s for their children, is to lay the foundation on di&s;cretion and virtue.</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is a &s;pecies of ill-breeding which I have ob&s;erved to be extremely prevalent among &s;everal of our modern pretenders to polite|ne&s;s; and which as it gives much unea&s;ine&s;s to a
<PB N="278" REF="295">
number of well-meaning people, I have taken the liberty of condemning in the following little nar|rative; and &s;hall, therefore, e&s;teem it as a &s;ingular obligation, if you will lay it before the public, through the channel of your excellent paper.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, that I live in a tollerably genteel &s;treet, not far from Lincoln's-inn, and have made it my principal &s;tudy during the whole time of my re&s;idence, to give no offence what&s;oever to any per&s;on in the neighbourhood. Unhappily however, Sir, there is an antiquated gentleman, who lives almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to me, and who has a family con&s;i&s;ting of a wife every whit as venerable as him&s;elf, two daughters to whom nature has been uncommonly par&s;imonious in the di&s;tribution of her per&s;onal graces, and a &s;ervant maid. As this amiable little community pique them&s;elves prodigiou&s;ly on the regularity of their own conduct, they are continually upon the watch to pry into the behaviour of every body el&s;e. Hence, Sir, if a gentleman knocks at my door about bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome one of them continually runs to the window to &s;ee who it is, and comments in a tone lould enough to be di&s;tinctly heard acro&s;s the way, either upon his dre&s;s or his per&s;on. If I have company with me in the parlour, &s;ome of them &s;tand centinel on me at the dining-room; and if I take my gue&s;ts into the dining-room, they mount to the &s;econd floor, where they have a full command of all my motions, and reduce me to the di&s;agreeable alternative of bearing the whole
<PB N="279" REF="296">
torrent of their impertinent ob&s;ervations, or of letting down my curtains. &mdash; To be &s;ure, Sir, I am not the only object of this obliging &s;olicitude; as far as they can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee, they manife&s;t a laudable anxiety for the conduct of their neighbours; and be|ing fortunately &s;ituated in a hou&s;e pretty remark|able for the convenience of it's pro&s;pect, they &s;trike a kind of awe through a number of families con|&s;iderably better than them&s;elves, and are almo&s;t as good as our reforming cla&s;s of con&s;tables, to en|force the minute&s;t propriety of behaviour.</P>
<P>DID their impertinence, however, extend no farther, it might perhaps be borne with &s;ome de|gree of temper, and they might po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;i|dered as objects of our pity, without ever exciting our re&s;entment. But alas! Mr. Babler, the buck|ling of a &s;hoe, or the wearing of a clean &s;hirt, &s;ets them into a tittering; and a little more powder in one's wig than ordinary, occa&s;ions a hor&s;e laugh. My wife, Sir, being as good-natured and placid a girl as ever exi&s;ted, this di&s;po&s;ition gives them &s;o great an advantage over her, that &s;he can never look out of her own window, and is always in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s if the &s;ervant keeps her a moment at the door. If &s;he puts on but a fre&s;h gown to vi&s;it a friend, &s;he hears, <HI>"Lord we are dre&s;t to day,"</HI> breaking from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet; and if &s;he &s;ends home but an humble leg of mutton from market, there is a, <Q>Pon my word we are re&s;olved to live well however, let who will pay for it."</Q> &mdash; Nay, Sir, my little girl, an infant under two years of

age, come in for her &s;hare of this delicate treat|ment; and her mother having a day or two ago bought her a new bonnet, the child has ever &s;ince undergone the &s;evere&s;t exertion of their wit, and <HI>"God love you look at mi&s;s"</HI> is the continual expre&s;|&s;ion whenever the maid appears with her at the door, or takes her out into Lincoln's-inn gardens for a little air and exerci&s;e. In &s;hort, Sir, not an article in our dre&s;s, nor a feature in our faces, e&s;capes the eagle-eyed notice of our worthy neigh|bours; and there is &s;carce a po&s;&s;ibility of con|ceiving how very unhappy we have been rendered by this exce&s;s of curio&s;ity and impertinence.</P>
<P>WERE the&s;e good people them&s;elves, either di&s;|tingui&s;hed for any uncommon elegance of appear|ance, or amiablene&s;s of per&s;on, this behaviour would be the le&s;s extraordinary; &mdash; but, Sir, &s;unday is perhaps the only day in the week on which they change their linnen; and I have already hinted, that there is no extraordinary &s;hare of beauty in the family. As for the father, he is an ab&s;olute <HI>Oran Otan</HI>; a meer man of the woods; the old gentlewoman is the immediate idea of that vener|able lady to whom <HI>Saul</HI> paid a midnight vi&s;it at <HI>Endor</HI>; and the elde&s;t daughter to an unmeaning|ne&s;s of face that actually borders upon lunacy, joins a couple of tu&s;hes that project a &s;urpri&s;ing way from the mouth, like the forks of an elephant; the younge&s;t, to borrow an expre&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Copper Captain,</HI> has a <HI>hu&s;k about her like a che&s;nut,</HI> which &s;o compleatly ab&s;orbs every ve&s;tige of humanity, that
<PB N="281" REF="298">
I am almo&s;t at a lo&s;s in what order of beings to rank her; and therefore, though her &s;ex has perhaps been already a&s;certained, I &s;hall put her &s;pecies down in the doubtful gender.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing, Mr. Babler, which betrays an under&s;tanding &s;o weak, or a heart &s;o malevo|lent, as an inclination to render others unde|&s;ervedly unea&s;y. The people of every little neigh|bourhood, like the members of the large&s;t com|munities, &s;hould always endeavour to engage one another's e&s;teem by a mutual intercour&s;e of good, at lea&s;t of obliging, offices: true politene&s;s, how|ever, this unfa&s;hionable &s;en&s;e of the word may be exploded, con&s;i&s;ts in exerting our utmo&s;t abilities to promote the &s;atisfaction of our neighbours. A contrary di&s;po&s;ition, though it may be reckoned extremely witty by &s;ome, can be con&s;idered in that light by none but the ignorant or the worth|le&s;s. Whoever thinks the approbation of &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential to their happine&s;s, has my full per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;ollicit it; but I will readily affirm that every &s;en&s;ible and benevolent mind will hold them in dete&s;tation or contempt, and look upon them as an equal di&s;grace and nui&s;ance to &s;ociety. What a pity is it, Sir, that like other nui&s;ances there is no method of pre&s;enting them by a grand jury: as there is not, &s;uffer me to pre|&s;ent them in this manner, and be a&s;&s;ured, you will have the thanks of many families in my part of the town, be&s;ides tho&s;e of your mo&s;t humble &s;ervants,</P>

<PB N="282" REF="299">
<HEAD>NUMB. LXV. <HI>Saturday, April</HI> 30.</HEAD>
<P>TO know mankind, and to profit by their fol|lies, is generally the wi&s;h of the mercenary; but there are &s;ome who think, that, expo&s;ing their own follies to the public view, is the true&s;t means of acquiring an in&s;ight into tho&s;e of others. This method of a man's &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to voluntary di&s;tre&s;s, in order to become acquainted with human nature, goes by the name of &s;eeing life; &s;o that, as the phra&s;e goes, the young fellow is now &s;aid to have &s;een mo&s;t of life who has experienced mo&s;t mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I HAVE often with pity regarded &s;ome of my more youthful acquaintance who took this ex|perimental way of becoming philo&s;ophers, and who thought proper to buy all the little wit they had by their &s;ufferings: and yet, in fact, when we come to examine this a&s;cetic &s;ect of &s;tudents, we &s;hall find them utterly ignorant of real life, and &s;killed only in the ceremonies of a night cellar, or the etiquette of a brothel.</P>
<P>IT is amu&s;ing enough to li&s;ten to one of the&s;e gentlemen, who has the character of being pro|foundly ver&s;ed in life, exerting his &s;uperiority of &s;kill in company. He has a new phra&s;e for every thing; <HI>"tip us a wag of your manus,"</HI> is, for in|&s;tance, &s;hake hands; <HI>"let us have a bu&s;s at your muns,"</HI> is let me ki&s;s you: for &s;uch humour as this, our
<PB N="283" REF="300">
unfortunate creature has had his head broken, his pockets picked, and his con&s;titution de&s;troyed, though fully convinced of his errors the very mo|ment he was running into them with the greate&s;t avidity.</P>
<P>IT has been often &s;aid, that half the pains which &s;ome men take to be rouges could very comfortably have &s;upported them in hone&s;ty. With equal truth it may be &s;aid, that half the la|bours which the&s;e men u&s;e in the pur&s;uit of plea|&s;ure, could have &s;upplied them with a double portion of the means. Plea&s;ure is not &s;o coy a mi|&s;tre&s;s as the&s;e men would per&s;uade us that &s;he is; &s;he needs not be pur&s;ued through the mazes of a night adventure, nor earned by the hazard of loo&s;ing a no&s;e; the u&s;ual beaten tract to happi|ne&s;s is ever the &s;ure&s;t, and to live like the re&s;t of mankind is a &s;trong pre&s;umption that the traveller is in the right way. When one of our blooded young fellows, with a true eccentricity of think|ing, &s;eparates from the crowd, in order to enjoy higher delights than his acquaintance, he only becomes the object of contempt and deri&s;ion, and like a deer in the fore&s;t he ever finds lea&s;t &s;afety when alone.</P>
<P>THE ridicule of every age has been levelled again&s;t this ab&s;urd pur&s;uer of life, and &s;till like the witch in the fable, as he has been hunted down in one &s;hape he has a&s;&s;umed another. In the Spectator's days, the buck of the time was called a <HI>Mohock</HI>; he afterwards received the ap|pellation
<PB N="284" REF="301">
of a <HI>Blood</HI>; and, at pre&s;ent, he is called a <HI>Buck:</HI> the three characters of the different times, however are very nearly the &s;ame; they differ in little more than appellation; and are all equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for malevolent of heart and weakne&s;s of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance in the characters of the&s;e worthy gentlemen who know &s;o much of life, is, that &s;carcely one in a thou&s;and of them knows any thing of life at all; or at be&s;t, like a maggot in a chee&s;e, he only eats into the rotten part of it, and, after fattening for a &s;ea&s;on on the common of folly and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, he comes out pampered with nothing but ignorance and immorality.</P>
<P>LET one of the mo&s;t experienced philo&s;ophers in the &s;y&s;tem of modern life, come, for half an hour, into company with two or three rational beings, and he looks as if he was ab&s;olutely of a different &s;pecies. &mdash; Conver&s;ant with nothing but what he ought <HI>not</HI> to know, he is incapable of conducting him&s;elf, either like a man of &s;en&s;e or a gentleman, and, acquainted only with the de&s;|picable frolicks of the Garden, he is at a vi&s;ible lo&s;s if a &s;ubject of the lea&s;t erudition is &s;tarted, and perplexed if he hears a &s;yllable bordering upon politene&s;s or good breeding; he langui&s;hes only for an indelicate toa&s;t, or an opportunity of introducing &s;ome paltry little adventure, which ought to be re&s;erved for a &s;et of intoxicated ap|prentices
<PB N="285" REF="302">
on a Chri&s;tmas holiday. Even in the pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t mode&s;t among the &s;ofter &s;ex, he does not he&s;itate to mention the name of &s;ome fa&s;hionate demirep; nor &s;cruple to boa&s;t of a Newgate acquaintance with an executed high|wayman.</P>
<P>YET, notwith&s;tanding this de&s;cription of a <HI>modern buck</HI> is pretty exact, there is an unac|countable ambition among the greate&s;t number of our young fellows to &s;hew a tolerable preten|&s;ion to the character. From a &s;trange opinion that libertini&s;m is a proof of good &s;en&s;e, they all &s;acrifice the little &s;en&s;e which they po&s;&s;e&s;s to be|come libertines, and are infinitely le&s;s fearful of being looked upon as profligates, than being ri|diculed as fools.</P>
<P>THOSE however, who would willingly arrive at the good opinion of the world, and merit the &s;ecret approbation of their own hearts, mu&s;t act upon a very oppo&s;ite principle. Little as the world may follow the documents of virtue, it neverthele&s;s admires them; and we our&s;elves are never more ready to venerate a man of principle, than when on account of our vices he treats us with contempt. Let us therefore, in&s;tead of being what in our hearts we really dete&s;t, endeavour to arrive at what we are ambitious to be thought; and make that very pride which hurries us into &s;uch a number of exce&s;&s;es, a laudable incentive to the road of perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="303">VIRTUE in fact wants only to be known to have a number of admirers; and as in the pur|&s;uit of tho&s;e vices which de&s;troy both our tem|poral and our eternal felicity, habit encrea&s;es our reli&s;h for per&s;evering; &s;o in the practice of all that can en&s;ure our happine&s;s here and hereafter, habit al&s;o impels us to proceed, and furni&s;hes con|tinual inducements, which gradually lead us to the mo&s;t exalted pinnacle of human excellence. The man therefore, who will not be happy, has no-body to cen&s;ure but him&s;elf; as the power is entirely in his hands, if he choo&s;es but to exert it.</P>
