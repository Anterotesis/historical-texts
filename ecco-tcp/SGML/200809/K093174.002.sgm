<HEAD>THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.</HEAD>
<P>AT the time when Fairies and Genii po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the powers which they have now lo&s;t, there lived in the country of the Brachmans a man named <HI>Indur,</HI> who was di&s;tingui&s;hed, not only for that gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition and humanity towards all living creatures, which are &s;o much cultivated among tho&s;e people, but for an in&s;atiable curio&s;ity re&s;pecting the nature and way of life of all animals. In pur&s;uit of knowledge of this kind he would frequently &s;pend the night among lonely rocks, or in the mid&s;t of thick fore&s;ts; and there, under &s;helter of a
<PB N="2" REF="5">
hanging cliff, or mounted upon a high tree, he would watch the motions and actions of all the animals that &s;eek their prey in the night; and remaining in the &s;ame &s;pot till the break of day, he would ob&s;erve this tribe of creatures retiring to their dens, and all others coming forth to enjoy the beams of the ri&s;ing &s;un. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, if he &s;aw any opportunity of exerci&s;ing his benevo|lence towards animals in di&s;tre&s;s, he never failed to make u&s;e of it; and ma|ny times re&s;cued the &s;mall birds from the pityle&s;s hawk, and the lamb or kid from the gripe of the wolf and lynx. One day, as he was &s;itting on a tree in the fore&s;t, a little frolic&s;ome monkey, in taking a great leap from one bough to another, chanced to mi&s;s his hold, and fell from a great height to the ground. As he lay there unable to move, <HI>Indur</HI> e&s;pied a large venomous &s;erpent ad|vancing to make the poor defencele&s;s creature his prey. He immediately de|&s;cended
<PB N="3" REF="6">
from his po&s;t, and taking the lit|tle monkey in his arms, ran with it to the tree, and gently placed it upon a bough. In the mean time, the enraged &s;erpent pur&s;uing him, overtook him before he could mount the tree, and bit him in the leg. Pre&s;ently, the limb began to &s;well, and the effects of the venom be|came vi&s;ible over <HI>Indur</HI>'s whole frame. He grew faint, &s;ick, and pale; and &s;ink|ing on the ground, was &s;en&s;ible that his la&s;t moments were fa&s;t approaching. As thus he lay, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear a human voice from the tree; and look|ing up, he beheld, on the bough where he had placed the monkey, a beautiful woman, who thus addre&s;&s;ed him:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Indur,</HI> I am truly grieved, that thy kindne&s;s to me &s;hould have been the cau&s;e of thy de&s;truction. Know, that in the form of the poor monkey, it was the potent fairy <HI>Perezinda</HI> to whom thou gave&s;t &s;uccour. Obliged to pa&s;s a cer|tain number of days every year under
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the &s;hape of an animal, I had cho&s;en this form; and though not mortal, I &s;hould have &s;uffered extreme agonies from the bite of the &s;erpent, had&s;t thou not &s;o humanely a&s;&s;i&s;ted me. It is not in my power to prevent the fatal effect of the poi&s;on; but I am able to grant thee any wi&s;h thou &s;halt form re&s;pecting the future &s;tate of exi&s;tence to which thou art now ha&s;tening. Speak, then, before it be too late, and let me &s;how my gratitude."</Q> <Q REND="inline">&mdash;"Great Perezinda!"</Q> replied <HI>Indur,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince you deign &s;o boun|teou&s;ly to return my &s;ervice, this is the reque&s;t that I make: In all my tran&s;mi|grations may I retain a rational &s;oul, with the memory of the adventures I have gone through; and when death &s;ets me free from one body, may I in&s;tantly ani|mate another in the prime of its powers and faculties, without pa&s;&s;ing through the helple&s;s &s;tate of infancy."</Q> <Q REND="inline">&mdash;"It is granted,"</Q> an&s;wered the Fairy; and im|mediately breaking a &s;mall branch from
<PB N="5" REF="8">
the tree, and breathing on it, &s;he threw it down to <HI>Indur,</HI> and bid him hold it fa&s;t in his hand. He did &s;o, and pre|&s;ently expired.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly, he found him&s;elf in a green valley by the &s;ide of a clear &s;tream, grazing amid a herd of <HI>Antelopes.</HI> He admired his elegant &s;hape, &s;leek &s;potted &s;kin, and poli&s;hed &s;piral horns; and drank with delight of the cool rivulet, cropt the juicy herb, and &s;ported with his companions. Soon, an alarm was given of the approach of an enemy; and they all &s;et off with the &s;wi&s;ne&s;s of the wind to the neighbouring immen&s;e plains, where they were &s;oon out of the reach of injury. <HI>Indur</HI> was highly de|lighted with the ea&s;e and rapidity of his motions; and &s;nuffing the keen air of the de&s;art, bounded away, &s;carcely deign|ing to touch the ground with his feet. This way of life went on very plea&s;antly for &s;ome time, till at length the herd was one morning alarmed with noi&s;es
<PB N="6" REF="9">
of trumpets, drums, and loud &s;houts, on every &s;ide. They &s;tarted, and ran fir&s;t to the right, then to the left, but were continually driven back by the &s;urround|ing crowd, which now appeared to be a whole army of hunters, with the king of the country and all his nobles, a&s;&s;embled on a &s;olemn chace, after the manner of the ea&s;tern people. And now the cir|cle began to clo&s;e, and numbers of af|frighted animals of various kinds throng|ed together in the centre, keeping as far as po&s;&s;ible from the dangers that ap|proached them from all quarters. The hunt&s;men were now come near enough to reach their game with their arrows; and the prince and his lords &s;hot at them as they pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed, killing and wounding great numbers. <HI>Indur</HI> and his &s;urviving companions &s;eeing no other means of e&s;cape, re&s;olved to make a bold pu&s;h towards that part of the ring which was the mo&s;t weakly guarded; and though many peri&s;hed in the at|tempt,
<PB N="7" REF="10">
yet a few, leaping over the heads of the people, got clear away; and <HI>In|dur</HI> was among the number. But whil&s;t he was &s;couring over the plain, rejoic|ing in his good fortune and conduct, an enemy &s;wifter than him&s;elf overtook him. This was a falcon, who, let loo&s;e by one of the hunt&s;men, da&s;hed like lightning after the fugitives; and alight|ing upon the head of <HI>Indur,</HI> began to tear his eyes with his beak, and flap his wings over his face. <HI>Indur,</HI> terrified and blinded, knew not which way he went; and in&s;tead of proceeding &s;traight forwards, turned round and came again towards the hunters. One of the&s;e, riding full &s;peed with a javelin in his hand, came up to him, and ran the weapon in his &s;ide. He fell down, and with repeated wounds was &s;oon di&s;|patched.</P>
<P>When the &s;truggle of death was over, <HI>Indur</HI> was equally &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed on finding him&s;elf &s;oaring high in the
<PB N="8" REF="11">
air, as one of a flight of <HI>Wild-Gee&s;e,</HI> in their annual migration to breed in the arctic regions. With va&s;t delight he &s;prung forward on ea&s;y wing through the immen&s;e fields of air, and &s;urveyed beneath him exten&s;ive tracts of earth, perpetually varying with plains, moun|tains, rivers, lakes, and woods. At the approach of night, the flock lighted on the ground, and fed on the green corn or gra&s;s; and at day-break they were again on wing, arranged in a regular wedge-like body, with an experienced leader at their head. Thus for many days they continued their journey, pa&s;&s;|ing over countries inhabited by various nations, till at length they arrived in the remote&s;t part of Lapland, and &s;ettled in a wide mar&s;hy lake, filled with numer|ous reedy i&s;lands, and &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with dark fore&s;ts of pine and birch. Here, in perfect &s;ecurity from man and hurtful animals, they followed the great bu&s;ine&s;s of breeding and providing for
<PB N="9" REF="12">
their young, living plentifully upon the in&s;ects and aquatic reptiles that abound|ed in this &s;heltered &s;pot. <HI>Indur</HI> with great plea&s;ure exerci&s;ed his various pow|ers, of &s;wimming, diving, and flying; &s;ailing round the i&s;lands, penetrating into every creek and bay, and vi&s;iting the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the woods. He &s;urveyed with a&s;toni&s;hment the &s;un, in|&s;tead of ri&s;ing and &s;etting, making a complete circle in the heavens, and cheering the earth with a perpetual day. Here he met with innumerable tribes of kindred birds, varying in &s;ize, plumage, and voice, but all pa&s;&s;ing their time in a &s;imilar manner, and furni&s;hed with the &s;ame powers for providing food and a &s;afe retreat for them&s;elves and their young. The whole lake was covered with parties fi&s;hing or &s;porting, and re|&s;ounded with their loud cries; while the i&s;lands were filled with their ne&s;ts, and new broods of young were continually coming forth and launching upon the
<PB N="10" REF="13">
&s;urface of the waters. One day, <HI>Indur</HI>'s curio&s;ity having led him at a di&s;tance from his companions to the woody bor|der of the lake, he was near paying dear for his heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s; for a fox, that lay in wait among the bu&s;hes, &s;prung upon him, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that by a &s;trong exertion he broke from his hold, not without the lo&s;s of &s;ome feathers.</P>
<P>Summer now drawing to an end, the va&s;t congregation of water-fowl began to break up; and large bodies of them daily took their way &s;outhwards, to pa&s;s the winter in climates where the waters are never &s;o frozen as to become unin|habitable by the feathered race. The wild-gee&s;e to whom <HI>Indur</HI> belonged, proceeded with their young ones by long daily journies acro&s;s Sweden, the Baltic &s;ea, Poland, and Turkey, to Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, and fini&s;hed their journey at the celebrated plains on the banks of the Cay&s;ter, a noted re&s;ort for their &s;pe|cies
<PB N="11" REF="14">
ever &s;ince the age of Homer, who in &s;ome very beautiful ver&s;es has de&s;crib|ed the manners and actions of the various tribes of aquatic birds in that favourite &s;pot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Not le&s;s their number than th' embodied cranes</L>

<BIBL>POPE's Homer.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Here they &s;oon recruited from the fatigue of their march, and enjoyed them&s;elves in the delicious climate till winter. This &s;ea&s;on, though here ex|tremely mild, yet making the means of &s;u&s;tenance &s;omewhat &s;carce, they were obliged to make foraging excur&s;ions to the cultivated lands in the neighbour|hood. Having committed great de|predations upon a fine field of young wheat, the owner &s;pread a net on the ground, in which <HI>Indur,</HI> with &s;everal of
<PB N="12" REF="15">
his companions, had the misfortune to be caught. No mercy was &s;hown them, but as they were taken out one by one, their necks were all broken.</P>
<P><HI>Indur</HI> was not immediately &s;en&s;ible of the next change he underwent, which was into a <HI>Dormou&s;e,</HI> fa&s;t a&s;leep in his hole at the foot of a bu&s;h. As it was in a country where the winters are pretty &s;evere, he did not wake for &s;ome weeks; when a thaw having taken place, and the &s;un beginning to warm the earth, he unrolled him&s;elf one day, &s;tretched, opened his eyes, and not being able to make out where he was, he rou&s;ed a female companion whom he found by his &s;ide. When &s;he was &s;ufficiently awakened, and they both began to feel hungry, &s;he led the way to a magazine of nuts and acorns, where they made a comfortable meal, and &s;oon fell a&s;leep again. This nap having la&s;ted a few days, they awaked a &s;econd time, and having eaten, they ventured to crawl to
<PB N="13" REF="16">
the mouth of their hole, where, pulling away &s;ome withered gra&s;s and leaves, they peeped out into the open air. Af|ter taking a turn or two in the &s;un, they grew chill, and went down again, &s;top|ping up the entrance after them. The cold weather returning, they took an|other long nap, till at length, &s;pring be|ing fairly &s;et in, they rou&s;ed in earne&s;t, and began to make daily excur&s;ions abroad. Their winter &s;tock of provi|&s;ion being now exhau&s;ted, they were for &s;ome time reduced to great &s;traits, and obliged to dig for roots and pig-nuts. Their fare was mended as the &s;ea&s;on ad|vanced, and they made a ne&s;t near the bottom of a tree, where they brought up a young family. They never rang|ed far from home, nor a&s;cended the higher branches of the tree, and pa&s;&s;ed great part of their time in &s;leep, even during the mid&s;t of &s;ummer. When autumn came, they were bu&s;ily em|ployed in collecting the nuts, acorns,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
and other dry fruits that fell from the trees, and laying them up in their &s;tore|hou&s;e under ground. One day, as <HI>In|dur</HI> was clo&s;ely engaged in this occu|pation, at &s;ome di&s;tance from his dwell|ing, he was &s;eized by a wild cat, who after tormenting him for a time, gave him a gripe, and put him out of his pain.</P>
<P>From one of the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t defencele&s;s of animals, <HI>Indur</HI> found him|&s;elf in&s;tantly changed into a maje&s;tic <HI>Elephant</HI> in a lofty fore&s;t of the i&s;le of Ceylon. Elated with this wonderful advancement in the &s;cale of creation, he &s;talked along with con&s;cious dignity, and &s;urveyed with plea&s;ing wonder his own form and that of his companions, together with the rich &s;cenery of the ever-verdant woods, which perfumed the air with their &s;picy odour, and lifted their tall heads to the clouds. Here, fearing no injury, and not de&s;iring to do any, the gigantic herd roamed at
<PB N="15" REF="18">
large, feeding on the green branches which they tore down with their trunks, bathing in deep rivers during the heat of the day, and repo&s;ing in the depths of the fore&s;ts, reclined again&s;t the ma&s;&s;y trunks of trees by night. It was long before <HI>Indur</HI> met with any adventure that could lead him to doubt his &s;e|curity. But one day, having penetrat|ed into a clo&s;e entangled thicket, he e&s;pied, lurking under the thick covert, a grim tyger, who&s;e eyes fla&s;hed rage and fury. Though the tyger was one of the large&s;t of his &s;pecies, yet his bulk was trifling compared to that of an ele|phant, a &s;ingle foot of which &s;eemed &s;ufficient to cru&s;h him; yet the fierce|ne&s;s and cruelty of his looks, his angry growl, and grinning teeth, &s;truck &s;ome terror into <HI>Indur.</HI> There was little time, however, for reflection; for when <HI>Indur</HI> had advanced a &s;ingle &s;tep, the tyger &s;etting up a roar, &s;prung to meet him, attempting to &s;eize his lifted trunk. <HI>In|dur</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="19">
was dexterous enough to receive him upon one of his tu&s;ks, and exerting all his &s;trength, threw the tyger to a great di&s;tance. He was &s;omewhat &s;tunned by the fall, but recovering, renewed the a&s;&s;ault with redoubled fury. <HI>Indur</HI> again, and a third time, threw him off; after which the tyger turning about, bounded away into the mid&s;t of the thicket. <HI>Indur</HI> drew back, and rejoin|ed his companions, with &s;ome abate|ment in the confidence he had placed in his &s;ize and &s;trength, which had not prevented him from undergoing &s;o dan|gerous an attack.</P>
<P>Soon after, he joined the re&s;t of the herd in an expedition beyond the bounds of the fore&s;t, to make depredations on &s;ome fields of maize. They committed great havock, devouring part, but tear|ing up and trampling down much more; when the inhabitants taking the alarm, a&s;&s;embled in great numbers, and with fierce &s;houts and flaming brands drove
<PB N="17" REF="20">
them back to the woods. Not con|tented with this, they were re&s;olved to make them pay for the mi&s;chief they had done by taking &s;ome pri&s;oners. For this purpo&s;e, they enclo&s;ed a large &s;pace among the trees with &s;trong po&s;ts and &s;takes, bringing it to a narrower and narrower compa&s;s, and ending at la&s;t in a pa&s;&s;age only capable of admit|ing one elephant at a time. This was divided by &s;trong cro&s;s-bars which would lift up and down, into &s;everal apart|ments. They then &s;ent out &s;ome tame female elephants, bred to the bu&s;ine&s;s, who approaching the herd of wild ones, inveigled the males to follow them to|wards the inclo&s;ures. <HI>Indur</HI> was among the fir&s;t who was decoyed by their arti|fices; and with &s;ome others following heedle&s;sly, he got into the narrowe&s;t part of the inclo&s;ure, oppo&s;ite to the pa&s;&s;age. Here they &s;tood awhile, doubt|ing whether they &s;hould go further. But the females leading the way, and utter|ing
<PB N="18" REF="21">
the cry of invitation, they ventured at length to follow. When a &s;ufficient number was in the pa&s;&s;age, the bars were let down by men placed for the purpo&s;e, and the elephants were fairly caught in a trap. As &s;oon as they were &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ituation, they &s;ell into a fit of rage, and with all their efforts en|deavoured to break through. But the hunters, throwing noo&s;es over them, bound them fa&s;t with &s;trong ropes and chains to the po&s;ts on each &s;ide, and thus kept them without food or &s;leep for three days; when, being exhau&s;ted with hunger and fatigue, they gave &s;igns of &s;ufficient tamene&s;s. They were now let out one by one, and bound each of them to two large tame elephants with riders on their backs, and thus without re&s;i&s;t|ance were led away clo&s;e pri&s;oners. They were then put into &s;eparate &s;ta|bles, and by proper di&s;cipline were pre|&s;ently rendered quite tame and gentle.</P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>Indur,</HI> with five more,
<PB N="19" REF="22">
was &s;ent over from Ceylon to the con|tinent of India, and &s;old to one of the princes of the country. He was now trained to all the &s;ervices elephants are there employed in; which were, to car|ry per&s;ons on his back in a kind of &s;e|dan or litter, to draw cannon, &s;hips, and other great weights, to kneel and ri&s;e at command, make obei&s;ance to his lord, and perform all the motions and attitudes he was ordered. Thus he liv|ed a long time, well fed and care&s;&s;ed, clothed in co&s;tly trappings on days of ceremony, and contributing to the pomp of ea&s;tern royalty. At length a war broke out, and <HI>Indur</HI> came to be em|ployed in a different &s;cene. After pro|per training, he was marched, with a number of his fellows, into the field, bearing on his back a &s;mall wooden tower, in which were placed &s;ome &s;ol|diers with a &s;mall field-piece. They &s;oon came in &s;ight of the enemy, and both &s;ides were drawn up for battle.
<PB N="20" REF="23">
<HI>Indur</HI> and the re&s;t were urged forwards by their leaders, wondering at the &s;ame time at the &s;cene in which they were engaged, &s;o contrary to their nature and manners. Pre&s;ently all was involved in &s;moke and fire. The elephants ad|vancing, &s;oon put to flight tho&s;e who were drawn up before them; but their career was &s;topped by a battery of can|non, which played furiou&s;ly again&s;t them. their va&s;t bodies offered a fair mark to the balls, which pre&s;ently &s;truck down &s;ome, and wounded others. <HI>Indur</HI> received a &s;hot on one of his tu&s;ks, which broke it, and put him to &s;uch pain and affright, that turning about, he ran with all &s;peed over the plain; and falling in with a body of their own infantry, he bur&s;t through, trampling down whole ranks, and fill|ing them with terror and confu&s;ion. His leader having now lo&s;t all command over him, and finding him hurtful only to his own party, applied the &s;harp in|&s;trument
<PB N="21" REF="24">
he carried, to the nape of his neck, and driving it in with all his force, pierced his &s;pinal marrow, &s;o that he fell lifele&s;s to the ground.</P>
<P>In the next &s;tage of his exi&s;tence, <HI>Indur</HI> to his great &s;urpri&s;e found even the va&s;t bulk of the elephant prodigi|ou&s;ly exceeded; for he was now a <HI>Whale</HI> of the large&s;t &s;pecies, rolling in the mid&s;t of the arctic &s;eas. As he darted along, the la&s;h of his tail made whirlpools in the mighty deep. When he opened his immen&s;e jaws, he drew in a flood of brine, which, on ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, he &s;pouted out again in a ru&s;hing foun|tain that ro&s;e high in the air with the noi&s;e of a mighty cataract. All the other inhabitants of the ocean &s;eemed as nothing to him. He &s;wallowed, al|mo&s;t without knowing it, whole &s;hoals of the &s;maller kinds; and the larger &s;wiftly turned a&s;ide at his approach. <Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> he cried to him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"what|ever other evils may await me, I am
<PB N="22" REF="25">
certainly &s;ecure from the mole&s;tations of other animals; for what is the creature that can dare to cope with me, or mea|&s;ure his &s;trength with mine?</Q> Having &s;aid this, he &s;aw &s;wimming near him a fi&s;h not a quarter of his length, armed with a dreadful row of teeth. This was a grampus, which directly flying upon <HI>Indur,</HI> fa&s;tened on him, and made his great teeth meet in his fle&s;h. <HI>Indur</HI> roared with pain, and la&s;hed the &s;ea till it was all in a foam; but could neither reach nor &s;hake off his cruel foe. He rolled over and over, ro&s;e and &s;unk, and exerted all his boa&s;ted &s;trength; but to no purpo&s;e. At length the grampus quitted his hold, and left him not a lit|tle mortified with the adventure. This was however forgotten, and <HI>Indur</HI> re|ceived plea&s;ure from his new &s;ituation, as he roamed through the boundle&s;s fields of ocean, now diving to its very bottom, now &s;hooting &s;wiftly to the &s;ur|face, and &s;porting with his companions
<PB N="23" REF="26">
in unwieldy gambols. Having cho&s;en a mate, he took his cour&s;e with her &s;outhwards, and in due time brought up two young ones, of whom he was extremely fond. The &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on being arrived, he more frequently than u&s;ual ro&s;e to the &s;urface, and ba&s;king in the &s;un-beams, floated unmoved with a large part of his huge body above the waves. As he was thus one day enjoy|ing a profound &s;leep, he was awakened by a &s;harp in&s;trument penetrating deep into his back. In&s;tantly he &s;prung away with the &s;wiftne&s;s of lightning, and feeling the weapon &s;till &s;ticking, he dived into the rece&s;&s;es of the deep, and &s;taid there till want of air obliged him to a&s;cend to the &s;urface. Here another harpoon was plunged into him, the &s;mart of which again made him fly from his un&s;een foes; but after a &s;horter cour&s;e, he was again compelled to ri&s;e, much weakened by the lo&s;s of blood, which gu&s;hing in a torrent, tinged the waters
<PB N="24" REF="27">
as he pa&s;&s;ed. Another wound was in|flicted, which &s;oon brought him almo&s;t lifele&s;s to the &s;urface; and the line fa&s;|tened to the fir&s;t harpoon being now pulled in, this enormous creature was brought, an unre&s;i&s;ting prey, to the &s;ide of a &s;hip, where he was &s;oon quite di&s;|patched, and then cut to pieces.</P>
<P>The &s;oul of this huge carca&s;e had next a much narrower lodging, for <HI>In|dur</HI> was changed into a <HI>Bee,</HI> which, with a great multitude of its young compa|nions, was on flight in &s;earch of a new &s;ettlement, their parents having driven them out of the hive, which was unable to contain them all. After a rambling excur&s;ion, the queen, by whom all their motions were directed, &s;ettled on the branch of a lofty tree. They all imme|diately clu&s;tered round her, and &s;oon formed a large black bunch, depending from the bough. A man pre&s;ently planting a ladder a&s;cended with a bee|hive, and &s;wept them in. After they
<PB N="25" REF="28">
were quietly &s;ettled in their new habita|tion, they were placed on a &s;tand in the garden along with &s;ome other colonies, and left to begin their labours. Every fine morning, as &s;oon as the &s;un was up, the greate&s;t part of them &s;allied forth, and roamed over the garden and the neighbouring fields in &s;earch of fre&s;h and fragrant flowers. They fir&s;t col|lected a quantity of gluey matter, with which they lined all the in&s;ide of their hou&s;e. Then they brought wax, and began to make their cells, building them with the utmo&s;t regularity, though it was their fir&s;t attempt, and they had no teacher. As fa&s;t as they were built, &s;ome were filled with liquid honey ga|thered from the nectaries of flowers; and as they filled the cells, they &s;ealed them up with a thin covering of wax. In other cells, the queen bee depo&s;ited her eggs, which were to &s;upply a new progeny for the en&s;uing year. Nothing could be a more plea&s;ing &s;ight, than to
<PB N="26" REF="29">
behold on a &s;un&s;hiny day the in&s;ects continually going forth to their labour, while others were as con&s;tantly arriving at the mouth of the hole, either with yellow balls of wax under their thighs, or full of the honey which they had drawn in with their trunks, for the pur|po&s;e of &s;pouting it out into the cells of the honey-comb. <HI>Indur</HI> felt much delight in this u&s;eful and active way of life, and was always one of the fir&s;t abroad at the dawn, and late&s;t home in the evening. On rainy and foggy days they &s;taid at home, and employed them&s;elves in fi|ni&s;hing their cells, and all the nece&s;&s;ary work within doors; and <HI>Indur,</HI> though endued with human rea&s;on, could not but admire the readine&s;s with which he and the re&s;t formed the mo&s;t regular plans of work, all corre&s;ponding in de|&s;ign and execution, guided by in&s;tinct alone.</P>
<P>The end of autumn now approach|ing, the bees had filled their combs with
<PB N="27" REF="30">
honey; and nothing more being to be got abroad, they &s;taid within doors, pa&s;&s;ing mo&s;t of their time in &s;leep. They eat a little of their &s;tore, but with great frugality; and all their meals were made in public, none daring to make free with the common &s;tock by him&s;elf. The owner of the hives now came and took them one by one into his hands, that he might judge by the weight whether or no they were full of honey. That in which <HI>Indur</HI> was, proved to be one of the heavie&s;t; and it was therefore re|&s;olved to take the contents. For this purpo&s;e, one cold night, when the bees were all fa&s;t a&s;leep, the hive was placed over a hole in the ground, in which were put brim&s;tone matches &s;et on fire. The fumes ro&s;e into the hive, and &s;oon &s;uf|focated great part of the bees, and &s;tu|pified the re&s;t, &s;o that they all fell from the combs. <HI>Indur</HI> was among&s;t the dead.</P>
<P>He &s;oon revived in the form of a
<PB N="28" REF="31">
young <HI>Rabbit</HI> in a &s;pacious warren. This was like a populous town; being every where hollowed by burrows run|ning deep under ground, and each in|habited by one or more families. In the evening, the warren was covered with a va&s;t number of rabbits, old and young, &s;ome feeding, others fri&s;king about, and pur&s;uing one another in wan|ton &s;port. At the lea&s;t alarm, they all hurried into the holes neare&s;t them; and were in an in&s;tant &s;afe from enemies, who either could not follow them at all, or if they did, were foiled in the cha&s;e by the numerous ways and turnings in the earth, communicating with each other, &s;o as to afford ea&s;y means of e&s;cape. <HI>Indur</HI> delighted much in this &s;ecure and &s;ocial life; and taking a mate, was &s;oon the father of a numer|ous offspring. Several of the little ones, however, not being &s;ufficiently careful, fell a prey either to hawks and crows continually hovering over the warren,
<PB N="29" REF="32">
or to cats, foxes, and other wild qua|drupeds, who u&s;ed every art to catch them at a di&s;tance from their holes. <HI>Indur</HI> him&s;elf ran &s;everal hazards. He was once very near being caught by a little dog trained for the purpo&s;e, who kept playing round for a con&s;iderable time, not &s;eeming to attend to the rab|bits, till having got near, he all at once darted into the mid&s;t of them. An|other time he received &s;ome &s;hot from a &s;port&s;man who lay on the watch be|hind a hedge adjoining the warren.</P>
<P>The number of rabbits here was &s;o great, that a hard winter coming on, which killed mo&s;t of the vegetables, or buried them deep under the &s;now, they were reduced to great &s;traits, and many were fami&s;hed to death. Some turnips and hay, however, which were laid for them, pre&s;erved the greater part. The approach of &s;pring renewed their &s;port and plea&s;ure; and <HI>Indur</HI> was made the father of another family. One night,
<PB N="30" REF="33">
however, was fatal to them all. As they were &s;leeping, they were alarmed by the attack of a ferret; and running with great &s;peed to the mouth of their burrow to e&s;cape it, they were all caught in nets placed over the holes. <HI>Indur</HI> with the re&s;t was di&s;patched by a blow on the back of the neck, and his body was &s;ent to the neare&s;t market town.</P>
<P>His next change was into a young <HI>Ma&s;tiff,</HI> brought up in a farm yard. Having nearly acquired his full &s;ize, he was &s;ent as a pre&s;ent to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who wanted a faith|ful guard for his hou&s;e and grounds. <HI>Indur</HI> pre&s;ently attached him&s;elf to his ma&s;ter and all his family, and &s;howed every mark of a noble and generous na|ture. Though fierce as a lion when|ever he thought the per&s;ons or pro|perties of his friends invaded, he was as gentle as a lamb at other times, and would patiently &s;uffer any kind of free|doms from tho&s;e he loved. He per|mitted
<PB N="31" REF="34">
the children of the hou&s;e to lug him about, ride on his back, and u&s;e him as roughly as their little hands were capable of; never, even when hurt, &s;hewing his di&s;plea&s;ure further than by a low growl. He was extremely in|dulgent to all the other animals of his &s;pecies in the yard; and when abroad, would treat the impertinent barking of little dogs with &s;ilent contempt. Once, indeed, being provoked beyond bear|ing, not only by the noi&s;e, but by the &s;naps, of a malicious whelp, he &s;uddenly &s;eized him in his open mouth; but when the by&s;tanders thought that the poor cur was going in&s;tantly to be devoured, they were equally diverted and plea&s;ed at &s;eeing <HI>Indur</HI> go to the &s;ide of a muddy ditch, and drop his antagoni&s;t, unhurt into the middle of it.</P>
<P>He had, however, more &s;erious con|flicts frequently to &s;u&s;tain. He was ac|cu&s;tomed to attend the &s;ervant on mar|ket days to the neighbouring town;
<PB N="32" REF="35">
when it was his office to guard the pro|vi&s;ion cart, while the man was making his purcha&s;es in the &s;hops. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, the bolde&s;t dogs in the &s;treet would &s;ometimes make an on&s;et in a body; and while &s;ome of them were engaging <HI>Indur,</HI> others would be mount|ing the cart, and pulling down the meat ba&s;kets. <HI>Indur</HI> had much ado to de|fend him&s;elf and the baggage too; how|ever, he never failed to make &s;ome of the a&s;&s;ailants pay dearly for their impu|dence; and by his loud barking, he &s;ummoned his human fellow-&s;ervant to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in time to prevent their depredations.</P>
<P>At length his courage was exerted on the mo&s;t important &s;ervice to which it could be applied. His ma&s;ter, return|ing home late one evening, was attack|ed near his own hou&s;e by three armed ruffians. <HI>Indur</HI> heard his voice calling for help, and in&s;tantly flew to his relief. He &s;eized one of the villains by the
<PB N="33" REF="36">
throat, brought him to the ground, and pre&s;ently di&s;abled him. The ma&s;ter, in the mean time, was keeping off the other two with a large &s;tick; but had received &s;everal wounds with a cutla&s;s; and one of the men had pre&s;ented a pi&s;|tol, and was ju&s;t on the point of firing. At this moment <HI>Indur,</HI> leaving his van|qui&s;hed foe on the ground, ru&s;hed for|ward, and &s;eizing the man's arm, made him drop the pi&s;tol. The ma&s;ter took it up; on which the other robber fled. He now advanced to him with whom <HI>Indur</HI> was engaged, and fired the pi&s;tol at him. The ball broke the man's arm, and from thence entered the body of <HI>Indur,</HI> and mortally wounded him. He fell, but had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing his ma&s;ter remain lord of the field; and the &s;ervants now coming up, made pri|&s;oners of the two wounded robbers. The ma&s;ter threw him&s;elf by the &s;ide of <HI>In|dur,</HI> and expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t concern at the accident which had made him the
<PB N="34" REF="37">
cau&s;e of the death of the faithful animal that had pre&s;erved his life. <HI>Indur</HI> died, licking his hand.</P>
<P>So generous a nature was now no longer to be annexed to a brutal form. <HI>Indur,</HI> awaking as it were from a trance, found him&s;elf again in the happy region he had formerly inhabited, and recom|menced the innocent life of a Brach|man. He cheri&s;hed the memory of his tran&s;migrations, and handed them down to po&s;terity, in a relation, from whence the preceding account has been extract|ed for the amu&s;ement of my young readers.</P>

<P>No, I have no family connex|ions, and indeed can &s;carcely be &s;aid ever to have had any: for, as you know, I was almo&s;t utterly neglected after the death of my father and mother, and while all my elder brothers and &s;i&s;ters were di&s;per&s;ed to one part or another, and the little remaining property was di&s;po&s;ed of, I was left with the poor people who nur&s;ed me, to be brought up ju&s;t as they thought proper; and the little pen&s;ion that was paid for me en|tirely cea&s;ed after a few years.</P>

With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the worthy clergyman of the pari&s;h, they put me to a day-&s;chool in the village, clothed me decently, and being them|&s;elves &s;ober religious per&s;ons, took care to keep me from vice.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right&mdash;they con&s;i&s;t of a bundle of &s;trings. Then look at their &s;talks&mdash;you will find them jointed and hollow, like the &s;traw of corn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The leaves, you &s;ee, of all the kinds are very long and narrow, taper|ing to a point at their ends. Tho&s;e of corn, you know, are the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;they are &s;o like gra&s;s at
<PB N="62" REF="67">
fir&s;t, that I can never tell the differ|ence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Next ob&s;erve the ears, or heads. Some of the&s;e, you &s;ee, are thick and clo&s;e, exactly like tho&s;e of wheat or bar|ley; others are more loo&s;e and open, like oats. The fir&s;t are generally called <HI>&s;pikes;</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>panicles.</HI> If you ex|amine them clo&s;ely, you will find that they all con&s;i&s;t of a number of di&s;tinct hu&s;ky bodies, which are properly the flowers; each of which is &s;ucceeded by a &s;ingle &s;eed. I dare &s;ay you have picked ears of wheat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes&mdash;I am very fond of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then&mdash;you found that the grains all lay &s;ingle, contained in a &s;caly hu&s;k, making a part of the ear, or head. Before the &s;eed was formed, there was a flower in its place. I do not mean a gay fine-coloured flower, but a few &s;cales, with threads coming out among them, each crowned with a white tip. And
<PB N="63" REF="68">
&s;oon after the ears of corn appear, you will find their flowers open, and the&s;e white tips coming out of them. This is the &s;tructure of the flowers and flow|ering heads of every one of the gra&s;s tribe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are the <HI>beards</HI> of corn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>The beards are bri&s;tles or points running out from the ends of the hu&s;ks. They are properly called <HI>awns.</HI> Mo&s;t of the gra&s;s tribe have &s;omething of the&s;e, but they are much longer in &s;ome kinds than in others. In barley, you know, they are very long, and give the whole field a &s;ort of downy or &s;ilky ap|pearance, e&s;pecially when waved by the wind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there the &s;ame kinds of corn and gra&s;s in all countries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. With re&s;pect to corn, that is in all countries the product of cultivation; and different &s;orts are found be&s;t to &s;uit different climates. Thus in the north|ern parts of the temperate zone, oats
<PB N="64" REF="69">
and rye are chiefly grown. In the mid|dle and &s;outhern, barley and wheat. Wheat is univer&s;ally the &s;pecies pre|ferred for bread-corn; but there are va|rious kinds of it, differing from each other in &s;ize of grain, firmne&s;s, colour, and other qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does not the be&s;t wheat of all grow in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. Wheat is better &s;uit|ed to the warmer climates, and it is only by great attention and upon particular &s;oils that it is made to &s;ucceed well here. On the other hand, the torrid zone is too hot for wheat and our other grains; and they chiefly cultivate rice there, and Indian corn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;een heads of Indian corn, as thick as my wri&s;t. But they do not look at all like our corn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;the &s;eeds all grow &s;ingle in a &s;ort of chaffy head; and the &s;talk and leaves re&s;emble tho&s;e of the gra&s;s tribe, but of a gigantic &s;ize. But there are

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it that makes one kind of gra&s;s better than another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are various properties which give value to gra&s;&s;es. Some &s;pread more than others, re&s;i&s;t fro&s;t and drought better; yield a greater crop of leaves, and are therefore better for pa&s;turage and hay. The juices of &s;ome are more nouri&s;hing and &s;weeter than others. In general, however, different gra&s;&s;es are &s;uited to different &s;oils; and by improv|ing &s;oils, the quality of the gra&s;s is im|proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does gra&s;s grow in all countries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;the green turf which na|turally covers fertile &s;oil in all countries, is chiefly compo&s;ed of gra&s;&s;es of various kinds. They form, therefore, the ver|dant
<PB N="67" REF="72">
carpet extended over the earth; and humble as they are, they contribute more to beauty and utility, than any other part of the vegetable creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What&mdash;more than trees?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly. A land entirely covered with trees would be gloomy, unwhole&s;ome, and &s;carcely inhabitable; whereas the meadow, the down, and the corn field, afford the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pects to the eye, and furni&s;h every nece&s;&s;ary, and many of the luxuries of life. Give us corn and gra&s;s, and what &s;hall we want for food?</P>

<P>COME&mdash;the tea is ready. Lay by your book, and let us talk a little. You have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in tea-making a great many times, and yet I dare &s;ay you ne|ver con&s;idered what kind of an opera|tion it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>On operation of cookery&mdash;is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="74">
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may call it &s;o; but it is properly an operation of <HI>chemi&s;try.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of chemi&s;try? I thought that had been a very deep &s;ort of a bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>O&mdash;there are many things in common life that belong to the deep|e&s;t of &s;ciences. Making tea is the che|mical operation called <HI>infu&s;ion,</HI> which is, when a hot liquor is poured upon a &s;ub&s;tance in order to extract &s;omething from it. The water, you &s;ee, extracts from the tea-leaves their colour, ta&s;te, and flavour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would not cold water do the &s;ame?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would, but more &s;lowly. Heat a&s;&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t all liquors in their power of extracting the virtues of herbs and other &s;ub&s;tances. Thus good hou&s;e|wives were formerly u&s;ed to boil their tea, in order to get all the goodne&s;s from it as completely as po&s;&s;ible. The greater heat and agitation of boiling makes it act more powerfully. The
<PB N="70" REF="75">
liquor in which a &s;ub&s;tance has been boiled is called a <HI>decoction</HI> of that &s;ub|&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we had a decoction of mutton at dinner to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had&mdash;broth is a decoction, and &s;o are gruel and barley-water. But when any thing is put to &s;teep in a cold liquor, it is called <HI>maceration.</HI> The in|gredients of which ink is made are <HI>ma|cerated.</HI> In all the&s;e ca&s;es, you &s;ee, the whole &s;ub&s;tance does not mix with the liquor, but only part of it. The rea|&s;on is, that part of it is <HI>&s;oluble</HI> in the li|quor, and part not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the meaning of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Solution</HI> is when a &s;olid put into a fluid entirely di&s;appears in it, leaving the liquor clear. Thus when I throw this lump of &s;ugar into my tea, you &s;ee it gradually wa&s;tes away till it is all gone; and then I can ta&s;te it in every &s;ingle drop of my tea; but the tea is clear as before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="71" REF="76">
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Salt would do the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would. But if I were to throw in a lump of chalk, it would lie undi&s;|&s;olved at the bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it would make the water white.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, while it was &s;tirred; and then it would be a <HI>diffu&s;ion.</HI> But while the chalk was thus mixed with the li|quor, it would lo&s;e its tran&s;parency, and not recover it again, till by &s;tanding the chalk had all &s;ub&s;ided, and left the liquor as it was before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is the cream mixed with the tea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that is only <HI>diffu&s;ed,</HI> for it takes away the tran&s;parency of the tea. But the particles of cream being finer and lighter than tho&s;e of chalk, it remains longer united with the liquor. However, in time the cream would &s;e|parate too, and ri&s;e to the top, leaving the tea clear. Now, &s;uppo&s;e you had a mixture of &s;ugar, &s;alt, chalk, and tea
<PB N="72" REF="77">
leaves, and were to throw it into water, either hot or cold;&mdash;what would be the effect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ugar and &s;alt would melt and di&s;appear. The tea-leaves would yield their colour and ta&s;te. The chalk&mdash;I do not know what would become of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if the mixture were &s;tirred, the chalk would be diffu&s;ed through it, and make it <HI>turbid</HI> or muddy; but on &s;tanding, it would leave it unchanged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there would remain at bottom the chalk and tea-leaves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. The clear liquor would contain in <HI>&s;olution</HI> &s;alt, &s;ugar, and tho&s;e particles of the tea, in which its colour and ta&s;te con&s;i&s;ted: the remainder of the tea, and the chalk, would lie undi&s;|&s;olved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I &s;uppo&s;e tea-leaves, after the tea is made, are lighter than at fir&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly. If taken out and dried they would be found to have lo&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="78">
part of their weight, and the water would have gained it. Sometimes, however, it is an extremely &s;mall portion of a &s;ub|&s;tance which is &s;oluble, but it is that in which its mo&s;t remarkable qualities re|&s;ide. Thus a &s;mall piece of &s;pice will communicate a &s;trong flavour to a large quantity of liquid, with very little lo&s;s of weight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will all liquors di&s;&s;olve the &s;ame things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. Many di&s;&s;olve in water, that will not in &s;pirit of wine; and the contrary. And upon this dif|ference many curious matters in the arts are founded. Thus, &s;pirit varni&s;h is made of a &s;olution of various gums or re&s;ins in &s;pirits that will not di&s;&s;olve in water. Therefore, when it has been laid over any &s;urface with a bru&s;h, and is become dry, the rain or moi&s;ture of the air will not affect it. This is the ca&s;e with the beautiful varni&s;h laid upon coaches. On the other hand, the
<PB N="74" REF="79">
varni&s;h le&s;t by gum-water could not be wa&s;hed off by &s;pirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember when I made gum|water, upon &s;etting the cup in a warm place, it all dried away, and left the gum ju&s;t as it was before. Would the &s;ame happen if I had &s;ugar or &s;alt di&s;&s;olved in water?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes&mdash;upon expo&s;ing the &s;olu|tion to warmth, it would dry away, and you would get back your &s;alt or &s;ugar in a &s;olid &s;tate as before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I were to do &s;o with a cup of tea, what &s;hould I get?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not tea-leaves, certainly! But your que&s;tion requires a little previous explanation. It is the property of heat to make mo&s;t things fly off in vapour, which is called <HI>evaporation</HI> or <HI>exhalation.</HI> But this it does in very different degrees to different &s;ub&s;tances. Some are very ea&s;ily made to <HI>evaporate;</HI> others very difficultly; and others not at all by the mo&s;t violent fire we can rai&s;e. Fluids,
<PB N="75" REF="80">
in general, are ea&s;ily <HI>evaporable;</HI> but not equally &s;o. Spirits of wine fly off in vapour much &s;ooner than water; &s;o that if you had a mixture of the two, by applying a gentle heat you might drive off all the &s;pirits, and leave the water pure. Water, again, is more evaporable than oil. Some &s;olid &s;ub|&s;tances are much di&s;po&s;ed to evaporate. Thus, &s;melling &s;alts by a little heat may be entirely driven away in the air. But in general, &s;olids are more <HI>fixed</HI> than fluids; and therefore when a &s;olid is di&s;|&s;olved in a fluid, it may commonly be recovered again by evaporation. By this operation common &s;alt is got from &s;ea-water and &s;alt &s;prings, both artifi|cially, and in hot countries by the na|tural heat of the &s;un. When the water is no more than is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to di&s;|&s;olve the &s;alt, it is called a <HI>&s;aturated &s;o|lution,</HI> and on evaporating the water fur|ther, the &s;alt begins to &s;eparate, form|ing little regular ma&s;&s;es called <HI>cry&s;tals.</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="81">
Sugar may be made in like manner to form cry&s;tals, and then it is &s;ugar|candy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is a &s;yrup?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, when &s;o much &s;ugar is di&s;&s;olved as &s;en&s;ibly to thicken the li|quor, but not to &s;eparate from it. Well&mdash;now to your que&s;tion about tea. On expo&s;ing it to con&s;iderable heat, tho&s;e fine particles in which its flavour con|&s;i&s;ts, being as <HI>volatile</HI> or evaporable as the water, would fly off along with it; and when the liquor came to dryne&s;s, there would only be left tho&s;e particles in which its roughne&s;s and colour con|&s;i&s;t. This would make what is called an <HI>extract</HI> of a plant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>What becomes of the water that evaporates?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It a&s;cends into the air, and unites with it. But if in its way it be &s;topped by any cold body, it is <HI>conden&s;ed,</HI> that is, it returns to the &s;tate of water again. Lift up the lid of the tea-pot, and you
<PB N="77" REF="82">
will &s;ee water collected on the in&s;ide of it, which is conden&s;ed &s;team from the hot tea beneath. Hold a &s;poon or knife in the way of the &s;team which bur&s;ts out from the &s;pout of the tea-kettle, and you will find it immediately covered with drops. This operation of turning a fluid into vapour, and then conden&s;|ing it, is called <HI>di&s;tillation.</HI> For this purpo&s;e, the ve&s;&s;el in which the liquor is heated is clo&s;ely covered with another called the head, into which the &s;team ri&s;es, and is conden&s;ed. It is then drawn off by means of a pipe into another ve&s;|&s;el called the receiver. In this way all &s;weet &s;cented and aromatic liquors are drawn from fragrant vegetables, by means of water or &s;pirits. The fra|grant part, being very volatile, ri&s;es along with the &s;team of the water or &s;pi|rit, and remains united with it after it is conden&s;ed. Ro&s;e-water and &s;pirit of lavender are liquors of this kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the water collected on the
<PB N="78" REF="83">
in&s;ide of the tea-pot lid &s;hould have the fragrance of the tea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;hould&mdash;But unle&s;s the tea were fine, you would &s;carcely perceive it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pup.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have heard of making &s;alt-water fre&s;h by di&s;tilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. That is an old di&s;covery lately revived. The &s;alt in &s;ea-water, being of a fixed nature, does not ri&s;e with the &s;team; and therefore, on con|den&s;ing the &s;team, the water is found to be fre&s;h. And this indeed is the method nature employs in rai&s;ing water by exhalation from the ocean, which collecting into clouds, is conden&s;ed in the cold regions of the air, and falls down in rain.</P>
<P>But our tea is done; &s;o we will now put an end to our chemical lecture.</P>

He fenced again&s;t the winter's cold by warm cloth|ing; and the long night of many weeks, which you would think &s;o gloomy, was to him a &s;ea&s;on of ea&s;e and fe&s;tivity in his habitation under ground. It is a very kind and wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ation of Pro|vidence, that every part of the world is rendered the mo&s;t agreeable to tho&s;e who live in it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR TOM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE we parted at the breaking-up, I have been for mo&s;t of the time at a plea&s;ant farm in Hertford&s;hire, where I have employed my&s;elf in rambling about the country, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting, as well as I could, in the work going on at home and in the fields. On wet days, and in the evenings, I have amu&s;ed my&s;elf with keeping a journal of all the great events that have happened among us; and hoping that when you are tired of the bu&s;tle of your bu&s;y town, you may receive &s;ome entertainment from com|paring our tran&s;actions with yours, I have copied out for your peru&s;al one of the days in my memorandum-book.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNAL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>June 10th.</HI> La&s;t night we had a dread|ful alarm. A violent &s;cream was heard from the hen-roo&s;t; the gee&s;e all &s;et up a cackle, and the dogs barked. Ned, the boy who lies over the &s;table, jumped up and ran into the yard, when he ob&s;erved a fox gallopping away with a chicken in his mouth, and the dogs in full cha&s;e af|ter him. They could not overtake him, and &s;oon returned. Upon further ex|amination, the large white cock was found lying on the ground all bloody, with his comb torn almo&s;t off, and his feathers all ruffled; and the &s;peckled hen and three chickens lay dead be&s;ide him. The cock recovered, but appeared ter|ribly frightened. It &s;eems that the fox had jumped over the garden hedge, and
<PB N="89" REF="94">
then cro&s;&s;ing part of the yard behind the &s;traw, had crept into the hen-roo&s;t through a broken pale. John the car|penter was &s;ent for, to make all fa&s;t, and prevent the like mi&s;chief again.</P>
<P>Early this morning the brindled cow was delivered of a fine bull-calf. Both are likely to do well. The calf is to be fattened for the butcher.</P>
<P>The duck-eggs that were &s;itten upon by the old balck hen were hatched this day, and the ducklings all directly ran into the pond, to the great terror of the hen, who went round and round, cluck|ing with all her might in order to call them out, but they did not regard her. An old drake took the little ones under his care, and they &s;wam about very mer|rily.</P>
<P>As Dolly this morning was milking the new cow that was bought at the fair, &s;he kicked with her hind-legs, and threw down the milk-pail, at the &s;ame time
<PB N="90" REF="95">
knocking Dolly off her &s;tool into the dirt. For this offence the cow was &s;en|tenced to have her head fa&s;tened to the rack, and her legs tied together.</P>
<P>A kite was ob&s;erved to hover a long while over the yard with an intention of carrying off &s;ome of the young chickens; but the hens called their broods together under their wings, and the cocks put them&s;elves in order of battle, &s;o that the kite was di&s;appointed. At length, one chicken, not minding its mother, but &s;traggling heedle&s;sly to a di&s;tance, was de&s;cried by the kite, who made a &s;ud|den &s;woop, and &s;eized it in his talons.&mdash;The chicken cried out, and the cocks and hens all &s;creamed; when Ralph the farmer's &s;on, who &s;aw the attack, &s;natched up a loaded gun, and ju&s;t as the kite was flying off with his prey, fired and brought him dead to the ground, along with the poor chicken, who was killed in the fall. The dead
<PB N="91" REF="96">
body of the kite was nailed up again&s;t the wall, by way of warning to his wick|ed comrades.</P>
<P>In the forenoon we were alarmed with &s;trange noi&s;es approaching us, and look|ing out we &s;aw a number of people with frying pans, warming pans, tongs and pokers, beating, ringing, and making all po&s;&s;ible din. We &s;oon di&s;covered them to be our neighbours of the next farm, in pur&s;uit of a &s;warm of bees which was hovering in the air over their heads. The bees at length alighted on the tall pear-tree in our orchard, and hung in a bunch from one of the boughs. A ladder was got, and a man a&s;cending with gloves on his hands and an apron tied over his head, &s;wept them into a hive which was rubbed on the in&s;ide with honey and &s;weet herbs. But as he was de&s;cending, &s;ome bees which had got under his gloves &s;tung him in &s;uch a manner, that he ha&s;tily threw down the
<PB N="92" REF="97">
hive, upon which the greater part of the bees fell out, and began in a rage to fly among the crowd, and &s;ting all whom they lit upon. Away &s;campered the people, the women &s;hrieking, the chil|dren roaring; and poor Adam, who had held the hive, was a&s;&s;ailed &s;o furiou&s;ly, that he was obliged to throw him&s;elf on the ground, and creep under the goo&s;eberry bu&s;hes. At length, the bees began to return to the hive, in which the queen bee had remained; and after a while, all being quietly &s;ettled, a cloth was thrown over it, and the &s;warm was carried home.</P>
<P>About noon, three pigs broke into the garden, where they were rioting upon the carrots and turnips, and doing a great deal of mi&s;chief by trampling the beds and rooting up the plants with their &s;nouts; when they were &s;pied by old Towzer the ma&s;tiff, who ran among them, and laying hold of their long ears
<PB N="93" REF="98">
with his teeth, made them &s;queel mo&s;t di&s;mally, and get out of the garden as fa&s;t as they could.</P>
<P>Roger the plowman, when he came for his dinner, brought word that he had di&s;covered a partridge's ne&s;t with &s;ix|teen eggs in the home field. Upon which the farmer went out and broke them all; &s;aying that he did not choo&s;e to rear birds upon his corn which he was not allowed to catch, but mu&s;t leave to &s;ome qualified &s;port&s;man, who would be&s;ides break down his fences in the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>A &s;heep-wa&s;hing was held this day at the mill-pool, when &s;even &s;core were well wa&s;hed, and then penned in the high meadow to dry. Many of them made great re&s;i&s;tance at being thrown into the water; and the old ram, being dragged to the brink by a boy at each horn, and a third pu&s;hing behind, by a &s;udden &s;pring threw two of them into
<PB N="94" REF="99">
the water, to the great diver&s;ion of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>Towards the du&s;k of the evening, the 'Squire's mongrel greyhound, which had been long &s;u&s;pected of worrying &s;heep, was caught in the fact. He had killed two lambs, and was making a hearty meal upon one of them, when he was di&s;turbed by the approach of the &s;hepherd's boy, and directly leaped the hedge and made off. The dead bodies were taken to the 'Squire's, with an in|dictment of wilful murder again&s;t the dog. But when they came to look for the culprit, he was not to be found in any part of the premi&s;es, and is &s;up|po&s;ed to have fled his country through con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his heinous offence.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph, who &s;leeps in the garret at the old end of the hou&s;e, after having been &s;ome time in bed, came down &s;tairs in his &s;hirt, as pale as a&s;hes, and fright|ened the maids, who were going up. It
<PB N="95" REF="100">
was &s;ome time before he could tell what was the matter: at length he &s;aid he had heard &s;ome dreadful noi&s;es over head, which he was &s;ure mu&s;t be made by &s;ome gho&s;t or evil &s;pirit; nay, he thought he had &s;een &s;omething mov|ing, though he owned he dur&s;t hardly lift up his eyes. He concluded with declaring, that he would rather &s;it up all night in the kitchen than go to his room again. The maids were almo&s;t as much alarmed as he, and did not know what to do; but the ma&s;ter, over|hearing their talk, came out, and in&s;i&s;t|ed upon their accompanying him to the &s;pot, in order to &s;earch into the affair. They all went into the garret, and for a while heard nothing; when the ma&s;ter ordered the candle to be taken away, and every one to keep quite &s;till. Jo|&s;eph and the maids &s;tuck clo&s;e to each other, and trembled every limb. At length a kind of groaning or &s;noring be|gan to be heard, which grew louder and
<PB N="96" REF="101">
louder, with intervals of a &s;trange &s;ort of hi&s;&s;ing. <Q REND="inline">"That's it!"</Q> whi&s;pered Jo|&s;eph, drawing back towards the door&mdash;the maids were ready to &s;ink; and even the farmer him&s;elf was a little di&s;con|certed. The noi&s;e &s;eemed to come from the rafters near the thatch. In a while, a glimp&s;e of moon-light &s;hining through a hole at the place, plainly di&s;|covered the &s;hadow of &s;omething &s;tir|ing; and on looking intently, &s;ome|what like feathers was perceived. The farmer now began to &s;u&s;pect what the ca&s;e was; and ordering up a &s;hort ladder, bid Jo&s;eph climb to the &s;pot, and thru&s;t his hand into the hole. This he did rather unwillingly, and &s;oon drew it back, crying loudly that he was bit. However, gathering courage, he put it in again, and pulled out a large white owl, another at the &s;ame time being heard to fly away. The cau&s;e of the alarm was now made clear enough; and poor Jo&s;eph, after being heartily jeered
<PB N="97" REF="102">
by the maids, though they had been as much frightened as he, &s;neaked into bed again, and the hou&s;e &s;oon became quiet.</P>

<HEAD>ON MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Father.&mdash;Henry.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY dear father, you ob&s;erved the other day that we had a great many <HI>manufactures</HI> in England. Pray what is a Manufacture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Manufacture is &s;omething made by the hand of man. It is derived from two Latin words, <HI>manus,</HI> the hand, and <HI>facere,</HI> to make. Manufactures are therefore oppo&s;ed to <HI>productions,</HI> which latter are what the bounty of nature &s;pontaneou&s;ly affords us; as fruits, corn, marble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there is a great deal of trouble with corn: you have often made me take notice how much pains it co&s;ts the farmer
<PB N="98" REF="103">
to plough his ground, and put the &s;eed in the earth, and keep it clear from weeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; but the farmer does not <HI>make</HI> the corn; he only prepares for it a proper &s;oil and &s;ituation, and re|moves every hindrance ari&s;ing from the hardne&s;s of the ground, or the neigh|bourhood of other plants, which might ob&s;truct the &s;ecret and wonderful pro|ce&s;s of vegetation; but with the vege|tation it&s;elf he has nothing to do. It is not <HI>his</HI> hand that draws out the &s;lender fibres of the root, pu&s;hes up the green &s;talk, and by degrees the &s;piky ear; &s;wells the grain, and embrowns it with that rich tinge of tawny ru&s;&s;et, which informs the hu&s;bandman it is time to put in his &s;ickle: all this operation is performed without his care or even knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now then I under&s;tand; corn is a <HI>Production,</HI> and bread a <HI>Manufac|ture.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="99" REF="104">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bread is certainly, in &s;trictne&s;s of &s;peech, a Manufacture; but we do not in general apply the term to any thing in which the original material is &s;o little changed. If we wanted to &s;peak of bread philo&s;ophically, we &s;hould &s;ay, it is a <HI>preparation</HI> of corn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is &s;ugar a Manufacture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, for the &s;ame rea&s;on. Be|&s;ides which, I do not recollect the term being applied to any article of food; I &s;uppo&s;e from an idea that food is of too peri&s;hable a nature, and generally ob|tained by a proce&s;s too &s;imple to de&s;erve the name. We &s;ay, therefore, &s;ugar|works, oil-mills, chocolate-works; we do not &s;ay a beer-manufactory, but a brewery; but this is only a nicety of lan|guage, for properly all tho&s;e are manu|factories, if there is much of art and cu|rio&s;ity in the proce&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do we &s;ay a manufactory of <HI>pic|tures?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but for a different rea&s;on.
<PB N="100" REF="105">
A picture, e&s;pecially if it belong to any of the higher kinds of painting, is an ef|fort of genius. A picture cannot be produced by any given combinations of canvas and colour. It is the hand in|deed, that executes, but the head that works. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds could not have gone, when he was engaged to paint a picture, and hired workmen, the one to draw the eyes, another the no&s;e, a third the mouth; the whole mu&s;t be the painter's own, that particular painter's, and no other; and no one who has not his ideas can do his work. His work is therefore nobler, of a higher &s;pecies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me an in&s;tance of a manufacture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The making of watches is a ma|nufacture: the &s;ilver, iron, gold, or whatever el&s;e is u&s;ed in it, are produc|tions, the material of the work; but it is by the wonderful art of man that they are wrought into the numberle&s;s wheels
<PB N="101" REF="106">
and &s;prings of which this complicated machine is compo&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then is there not as much art in making a watch as a picture? Does not the head work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, in the original inven|tion of watches, as much, or more, than in painting; but when once invented, the art of watch-making is capable of being reduced to a mere mechanical la|bour, which may be exerci&s;ed by any man of common capacity, according to certain preci&s;e rules, when made fami|liar to him by practice. This, painting is not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear father, making of books &s;urely requires a great deal of thinking and &s;tudy; and yet I remem|ber the other day at dinner a gentleman &s;aid that Mr. Pica had <HI>manufactured</HI> a large volume in le&s;s than a fortnight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was meant to convey a &s;atirical remark on his book, becau&s;e it was compiled from other authors, from whom
<PB N="102" REF="107">
he had taken a page in one place, and a page in another; &s;o that it was not produced by the labour of his brain, but of his hands. Thus you heard your mother complain that the London cream was <HI>manufactured;</HI> which was a pointed and conci&s;e way of &s;aying that the cream was not what it ought to be, nor what it pretended to be; for cream, when genuine, is a pure production; but when mixed up and adulterated with flour and i&s;ingla&s;s, and I know not what, it be|comes a Manufacture. It was as much as to &s;ay, art has been here, where it has no bu&s;ine&s;s; where it is not beneficial, but hurtful. A great deal of the deli|cacy of language depends upon an ac|curate knowledge of the &s;pecific mean|ing of &s;ingle terms, and a nice attention to their relative propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have all nations Manufactures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that are in any degree cul|tivated; but it very often happens that countries naturally the poore&s;t have ma|nufactures
<PB N="103" REF="108">
of the greate&s;t extent and va|riety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I appre|hend, that individuals, who are rich without any labour of their own, are &s;eldom &s;o indu&s;trious and active as tho&s;e who depend upon their own exertions: thus the Spaniards, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the rich|e&s;t gold and &s;ilver mines in the world, are in want of many conveniences of life which are enjoyed in London and Am&s;terdam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can comprehend that; I be|lieve if my uncle Ledger were to find a gold mine under his warehou&s;e, he would &s;oon &s;hut up &s;hop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe &s;o. It is not, however, ea&s;y to e&s;tabli&s;h Manufactures in a <HI>very poor</HI> nation; they require &s;cience and genius for their invention, art and con|trivance for their execution; order, peace, and union, for their flouri&s;hing; they require a number of men to com|bine
<PB N="104" REF="109">
together in an undertaking, and to pro&s;ecute it with the mo&s;t patient in|du&s;try; they require, therefore, laws and government for their protection. If you &s;ee exten&s;ive Manufactures in any nation, you may be &s;ure it is a civilized nation; you may be &s;ure property is accurately a&s;certained and protected. They re|quire great expences for their fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, co&s;tly machines for &s;horten|ing manual labour, and money and cre|dit for purcha&s;ing materials from di&s;tant countries. There is not a &s;ingle Manu|facture of Great Britain which does not require, in &s;ome part or other of its pro|ce&s;s, productions from the different parts of the globe; oils, drugs, varni&s;h, quick|&s;ilver, and the like; it requires, there|fore, <HI>&s;hips</HI> and a friendly intercour&s;e with foreign nations to tran&s;port commodi|ties, and exchange productions. We could not be a manufacturing, unle&s;s we were al&s;o a commercial nation. They require time to take root in any place,
<PB N="105" REF="110">
and their excellence often depends upon &s;ome nice and delicate circum&s;tance; a peculiar quality, for in&s;tance, in the air, or water, or &s;ome other local circum|&s;tance not ea&s;ily a&s;certained. Thus, I have heard, that the Iri&s;h women &s;pin better than the Engli&s;h, becau&s;e the moi&s;ter temperature of their climate makes their &s;kin more &s;oft and their fingers more flexible: thus again we cannot dye &s;o beautiful a &s;carlet as the French can, though with the &s;ame drugs, perhaps on account of the &s;uperior pu|rity of their air. But though &s;o much is nece&s;&s;ary for the perfection of the more curious and complicated Manufactures, all nations po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e which are &s;ub|&s;ervient to the common conveniences of life&mdash;the loom and the forge, particu|larly, are of the highe&s;t antiquity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I remember Hector bids Andromache return to her apartment, and employ her&s;elf in weaving with her
<PB N="106" REF="111">
maids; and I remember the &s;hield of Achilles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and you likewi&s;e remem|ber, in an earlier period, the fine linen of Egypt; and, to go &s;till higher, the working in bra&s;s and iron is recorded of Tubal Cain before the flood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is the mo&s;t important, Manufactures or Agriculture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agriculture is the mo&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> becau&s;e it is fir&s;t of all nece&s;&s;ary that man &s;hould live; but almo&s;t all the en|joyments and comforts of life are pro|duced by Manufactures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are we obliged to take &s;o much pains to make our&s;elves com|fortable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To exerci&s;e our indu&s;try. Na|ture provides the materials for man. She pours out at his feet a profu&s;ion of gems, metals, dyes, plants, ores, barks, &s;tones, gums, wax, marbles, woods, roots, &s;kins, earths, and minerals of all kinds. She has likewi&s;e given him tools.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="107" REF="112">
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not know that Nature gave us tool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! what are tho&s;e two in&s;tru|ments you carry always about with you, &s;o &s;trong and yet &s;o flexible, &s;o nicely jointed, and branched out into five long taper, unequal divi&s;ions, any of which may be contracted or &s;tretched out at plea|&s;ure; the extremities of which have a feel|ing &s;o wonderfully delicate, and which are &s;trengthened and defended by horn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Man is as much &s;uperior to the brutes in his outward form, by means of the hand, as he is in his mind by the gifts of rea&s;on. The trunk of the elephant comes perhaps the neare&s;t to it in its exqui&s;ite feeling and flexibility (it is, indeed, called his hand in Latin), and accordingly that animal has always been reckoned the wi&s;e&s;t of brutes. When Nature gave man the hand, &s;he &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Exerci&s;e your ingenuity, and work."</Q> As &s;oon as ever man ri&s;es
<PB N="108" REF="113">
above the &s;tate of a &s;avage, he begins to contrive and to make things, in or|der to improve his forlorn condition; thus you may remember Thom&s;on re|pre&s;ents Indu&s;try coming to the poor &s;hivering wretch, and teaching him the arts of life:<Q><L>Taught him to chip the wood, and hew the &s;tone,</L>
<L>Till by degrees the fini&s;h'd fabric ro&s;e;</L>
<L>Tore from his limbs the blood-polluted fur,</L>
<L>And wrapt them in the woolly ve&s;tment warm,</L>
<L>Or bright in glo&s;&s;y &s;ilk and flowing lawn.</L></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>It mu&s;t require a great deal of knowledge, I &s;uppo&s;e, for &s;o many cu|rious works; what kind of knowledge is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not any which may not be occa&s;ionally employed; but the two &s;ciences which mo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t the manufac|turer are <HI>mechanics</HI> and <HI>chemi&s;try.</HI> The one for building mills, working of mines, and in general for con&s;tructing wheels, wedges, pullies, &amp;c. either to &s;horten

the labour of man, by performing it in le&s;s time, or to perform what the &s;trength of man alone could not ac|compli&s;h:&mdash;the other in fu&s;ing and working ores, in dying and bleaching, and extracting the virtues of various &s;ub&s;tances for particular u&s;es: making of &s;oap, for in&s;tance, is a chemical operation; and by chemi&s;try an inge|nious gentleman has lately found out a way of bleaching a piece of cloth in eight and forty hours, which by the common proce&s;s would have taken up a great many weeks.&mdash;You have heard of Sir Richard Arkwright who died lately&mdash;</P>

<P>We have at pre&s;ent a greater va|riety than I can pretend to enumerate, but our &s;taple Manufacture is woollen cloth. England abounds in fine pa&s;|tures and exten&s;ive downs, which feed great numbers of &s;heep; hence our wool has always been a valuable arti|cle of trade; but we did not always know how to work it. We u&s;ed to &s;ell it to the Flemi&s;h or Lombards, who wrought it into cloth; till in the year 1326, Edward the Third invited &s;ome Flemi&s;h weavers over to teach us the art; but there was not much made in England till the reign of Henry the Se|venth.

Manche&s;ter and Birmingham are towns which have ari&s;en to great con&s;equence from &s;mall beginnings, al|mo&s;t within the memory of old men now living; the fir&s;t for cotton and mu&s;lin goods, the &s;econd for cutlery and hard|ware, in which we at this moment ex|cel all Europe. Of late years, too, carpets, beautiful as fine tape&s;try, have been fabricated in this country. Our clocks and watches are greatly e&s;teemed. The earthen-ware plates and di&s;hes, which we all u&s;e in common, and the elegant &s;et for the tea-table, ornament|ed with mu&s;ical in&s;truments, which we admired in our vi&s;it ye&s;terday, belong to a very exten&s;ive manufactory, the &s;eat of which is at Bur&s;lem in Staf|ford&s;hire. The principal potteries there belong to one per&s;on, an excellent chy|mi&s;t, and a man of great ta&s;te; he, in conjunction with another man of ta&s;te who is &s;ince dead, has made our clay more valuable than the fine&s;t porcelain

In the more common articles he has pen|ciled it with the mo&s;t elegant de&s;igns, &s;haped it into &s;hells and leaves, twi&s;ted it into wicker-work, and trailed the ductile foliage round the light ba&s;ket. He has filled our cabinets and chimney|pieces with urns, lamps, and va&s;es, on which are lightly traced, with the pure&s;t &s;implicity, the fine forms and floating draperies of Herculaneum. In &s;hort, he has given to our hou&s;es a cla&s;&s;ic air, and has made every &s;aloon and every din|ing-room &s;chools of ta&s;te. I &s;hould add that there is a great demand abroad for this elegant Manufacture.

<SP>

<P>I do not well under&s;tand that phra&s;e.</P>

<P>It means that they have no pre|ci&s;e and determinate &s;ignification in them&s;elves, but are applied differently according to the other ideas which you join with them, and the different po&s;i|tions in which you view them.

If you were to give an idea of a hor&s;e from its &s;ize, you would certainly &s;ay it was much bigger than a dog; yet if you take the &s;malle&s;t Shetland hor&s;e, and the large&s;t Iri&s;h greyhound, you will find them very much upon a par: &s;ize, therefore, is not a circum|&s;tance by which you can accurately di&s;|tingui&s;h

<P>No, never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think we run any hazard of a &s;tranger telling us, Sir, hor&s;es are hoofed indeed in your country, but in mine, which is in a different climate, and where we feed them differently, they have claws?</P>

<SP>

<P>No, I dare &s;ay not.</P>

<P>No, it is divided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hor&s;e, then, is not only hoof|ed, but <HI>whole-hoofed.</HI> Now how many quadrupeds do you think there are in the world that are whole-hoofed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are, among all animals that we are acquainted with, either in this country or in any other, only the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, and the zebra, which is a &s;pe|cies of wild a&s;s. Now, therefore, you &s;ee we have nearly accompli&s;hed our purpo&s;e; we have only to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the a&s;s.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is ea&s;ily done, I believe; I

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not &s;o ea&s;y, however, as you ima|gine; the eye readily di&s;tingui&s;hes them by the air and general appearance, but naturali&s;ts have been rather puzzled to fix upon any &s;pecific difference, which may &s;erve the purpo&s;e of a definition. Some have, therefore, fixed upon the ears, others on the mane and tail. What kind of ears has an a&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, very long clum&s;y ears. A&s;&s;es' ears are always laughed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the hor&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hor&s;e has &s;mall ears, nicely turned, and upright.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the mane, is there no differ|ence there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hor&s;e has a fine long flowing mane; the a&s;s has hardly any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the tail; is it not fuller of hair in the hor&s;e than in the a&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; the a&s;s has only a few long hairs at the end of his tail; but the hor&s;e
<PB N="132" REF="137">
has a long bu&s;hy tail, when it is not cut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which, by the way, it is pity it ever &s;hould. Now, then, ob&s;erve what particulars we have got. <HI>A hor&s;e is an animal of the quadruped kind, whole|hoofed, with &s;hort erect ears, a flowing mane, and a tail covered in every part with long ears.</HI> Now is there any other animal, think you, in the world that an&s;wers the&s;e particulars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know; this does not tell us a great deal about him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet it tells us enough to di&s;|tingui&s;h him from all the different tribes of the creation which we are acquainted with in any part of the earth. Do you know now what we have been making?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>A DEFINITION. It is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a definition to di&s;tingui&s;h pre|ci&s;ely the thing defined from every other thing, and to do it in as few terms as po&s;&s;ible. Its object is to &s;eparate the
<PB N="133" REF="138">
&s;ubject of definition, fir&s;t, from tho&s;e with which it has only a general re&s;em|blance; then, from tho&s;e which agree with it in a greater variety of particu|lars; and &s;o on, till by con&s;tantly throw|ing out all which have not the qualities we have taken notice of, we come at length to the individual or the &s;pecies we wi&s;h to a&s;certain. It is a kind of cha&s;e, and re&s;embles the manner of hunting in &s;ome countries, where they fir&s;t enclo&s;e a very large circle with their dogs, nets, and hor&s;es; and then, by degrees, draw their toils clo&s;er and clo&s;er, driving their game before them till it is at length brought into &s;o narrow a compa&s;s, that the &s;port&s;men have nothing to do but to knock down their prey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ju&s;t as we have been hunting this hor&s;e, till at la&s;t we held him fa&s;t by his ears and his tail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould ob&s;erve to you, that in the definition naturali&s;ts give of a hor&s;e, it is generally mentioned that he has
<PB N="134" REF="139">
&s;ix cutting teeth in each jaw; becau&s;e this circum&s;tance of the teeth has been found a very convenient one for cha|racteri&s;ing large cla&s;&s;es: but as it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary here, I have omitted it; a definition being the more perfect the fewer particulars you make u&s;e of, provided you can &s;ay with certainty from tho&s;e particulars, The object &s;o characteri&s;ed mu&s;t be this, and no other whatever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, if I had never &s;een a hor&s;e, I &s;hould not know what kind of animal it was by this definition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hear, then, how you would give me an idea of a hor&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would &s;ay it was a fine large prancing creature, with &s;lender legs and an arched neck, and a &s;leek &s;mooth &s;kin, and a tail that &s;weeps the ground, and that he &s;norts and neighs very loud, and to&s;&s;es his head, and runs as &s;wift as the wind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you learned &s;ome ver&s;es
<PB N="135" REF="140">
upon the hor&s;e in your la&s;t le&s;&s;on: re|peat them.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<Q><L>The wanton cour&s;er thus with reins unbound</L>
<L>Breaks from his &s;tall, and beats the trembling ground;</L>
<L>Pamper'd and proud, he &s;eeks the wonted tides,</L>
<L>And laves, in height of blood, his &s;hining &s;ides;</L>
<L>His head, now freed, he to&s;&s;es to the &s;kies;</L>

<P>You have &s;aid very well; but this is not a <HI>Definition,</HI> it is a <HI>De&s;cription.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the difference?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>A de&s;cription is intended to give you a lively picture of an object, as if you &s;aw it; it ought to be very full. A definition gives no picture to tho&s;e who have not &s;een it; it rather tells you what its &s;ubject is not, than what it is, by giving you &s;uch clear &s;pecific marks, that it &s;hall not be po&s;&s;ible to confound
<PB N="136" REF="141">
it with any thing el&s;e; and hence it is of the greate&s;t u&s;e in throwing things into cla&s;&s;es. We have a great many beautiful de&s;criptions from antient au|thors &s;o loo&s;ely worded that we cannot certainly tell what animals are meant by them, whereas if they had given us de|finitions, three lines would have a&s;cer|tained their meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like a de&s;cription be&s;t, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps &s;o; I believe I &s;hould have done the &s;ame at your age. Re|member, however, that nothing is more u&s;eful than to learn to form ideas with preci&s;ion, and to expre&s;s them with ac|curacy: I have not given you a defini|tion to teach you what a hor&s;e is, but to teach you to <HI>think.</HI></P>

The Phenix, with a kind of in&s;ulting compa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid to her, <Q REND="inline">"Poor bird, how much I pity thee! confined to a &s;ingle &s;pot, and &s;unk in dome&s;tic cares, thou art continually employed either in laying eggs or in providing for thy brood; and thou exhau&s;te&s;t thy life and &s;trength in perpetuating a feeble and de|fencele&s;s race. As to my&s;elf, I live ex|empt from toil, care, and misfortune. I feed upon nothing le&s;s precious than rich gums and &s;pices; I fly through the trackle&s;s regions of the air, and when I
<PB N="138" REF="143">
am &s;een by men, am gazed at with cu|rio&s;ity and a&s;toni&s;hment; I have no one to controul my range, no one to pro|vide for; and when I have fulfilled my five centuries of life, and &s;een the revo|lutions of ages, I rather vani&s;h than die, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;or without my care, &s;prings up from my a&s;hes.

<P>The Dove replied, <Q REND="inline">"O Phenix, I pity thee much more than thou affecte&s;t to pity me!

<HEAD>THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I WILL now, as I promi&s;ed, give you an account of the elegant and u&s;e|ful manufacture of <HI>Paper,</HI> the ba&s;is of which is it&s;elf a manufacture. This de|licate and beautiful &s;ub&s;tance is made from the meane&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting materials, from old rags, which have pa&s;&s;ed from one poor per&s;on to another, and at length have perhaps dropped in tatters from the child of the beggar. The&s;e are carefully picked up from dunghills, or bought from &s;ervants by Jews, who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to go about and collect them. They &s;ell them to the rag-merchant, who gives from two-pence to four-pence a pound, according to their quality; and he, when he has got a &s;ufficient quantity, di&s;po&s;es of them to the owner of the paper-mill. He gives them fir&s;t to women to &s;ort and
<PB N="141" REF="146">
pick, agreeably to their different de|grees of finene&s;s: they al&s;o with a knife cut out carefully all the &s;eams, which they throw into a ba&s;ket for other pur|po&s;es: they then put them into the du&s;ting-engine, a large circular wire &s;ieve, from whence they receive &s;ome degree of clean&s;ing. The rags are then conveyed to the mill. Here they were formerly beat to pieces with va&s;t ham|mers, which ro&s;e and fell continually with a mo&s;t tremendous noi&s;e that was heard from a great di&s;tance. But now they put the rags into a large trough or ci&s;tern, into which a pipe of clear &s;pring water is con&s;tantly flowing. In this ci&s;tern is placed a cylinder, about two feet long, &s;et thick round with rows of iron &s;pikes, &s;tanding as near as they can to one another without touching. At the bottom of the trough there are cor|re&s;ponding rows of &s;pikes. The cy|linder is made to whirl round with in|conceivable rapidity, and with the&s;e iron
<PB N="142" REF="147">
teeth rends and tears the cloth in every po&s;&s;ible direction; till, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the water, which continually flows through the ci&s;tern, it is thoroughly ma&s;ticated, and reduced to a fine pulp; and by the &s;ame proce&s;s all its impuri|ties are clean&s;ed away, and it is re&s;tored to its original whitene&s;s. This proce&s;s takes about &s;ix hours. To improve the colour they then put in a little &s;malt, which gives it that blui&s;h ca&s;t which all Paper has more or le&s;s: the French Paper has le&s;s of it than ours. This fine pulp is next put into a copper of warm water. It is the &s;ub&s;tance of paper, but the form mu&s;t now be given it: for this purpo&s;e they u&s;e a mould. It is made of wire, &s;trong one way, and cro&s;&s;ed with finer. This mould they ju&s;t dip horizontally into the copper, and take it out again. It has a little wooden frame on the edge, by means of which it retains as much of the pulp as is want|ed for the thickne&s;s of the &s;heet, and the
<PB N="143" REF="148">
&s;uperfluity runs off through the inter|&s;tices of the wires. Another man in|&s;tantly receives it, opens the frame, and turns out the thin &s;heet, which has now &s;hape, but not con&s;i&s;tence, upon &s;oft felt, which is placed on the ground to receive it. On that is placed another piece of felt, and then another &s;heet of Paper, and &s;o on till they have made a pile of forty or fifty. They are then pre&s;&s;ed with a large &s;crew-pre&s;s, moved by a long lever, which forcibly &s;queezes the water out of them, and gives them immediate con&s;i&s;tence. There is &s;till however, a great deal to be done. The felts are taken off and thrown on one &s;ide, and the Paper on the other, from whence it is dexterou&s;ly taken up with an in&s;trument in the form of a T, three &s;heets at a time, and hung on lines to dry. There it hangs for a week or ten days, which likewi&s;e further whitens it; and any knots and roughne&s;&s;es it may have are picked off carefully by the wo|men.
<PB N="144" REF="149">
It is then &s;ized. Size is a kind of glue; and without this preparation the Paper would not bear ink; it would run and blot as you &s;ee it does on grey Paper. The &s;heets are ju&s;t dipped into the &s;ize, and taken out again. The exact degree of &s;izing is a matter of nicety, which can only be known by ex|perience. They are then hung up again to dry, and when dry taken to the fi|ni&s;hing-room, where they are examined a new, pre&s;&s;ed in the dry pre&s;&s;es, which gives them their la&s;t glo&s;s and &s;mooth|ne&s;s; counted out into quires, made up in reams, and &s;ent to the &s;tationer's, from whom we have it, after he has folded it again and cut the edges; &s;ome too he makes to &s;hine like &s;atin, by glo&s;&s;ing it with hot plates. The whole proce&s;s of Paper-making takes about three weeks.</P>

<P>It is a very curious proce&s;s in|deed. I &s;hall almo&s;t &s;cruple for the fu|ture to blacken a &s;heet of Paper with a

<P>It is true that there is hardly any thing we u&s;e with &s;o much wa&s;te and profu&s;ion as this manufacture; we &s;hould think our&s;elves confined in the u&s;e of it, if we might not tear, di&s;per&s;e, and de|&s;troy it in a thou&s;and ways; &s;o that it is really a&s;toni&s;hing from whence linen enough can be procured to an&s;wer &s;o va&s;t a demand. As to the coar&s;e brown papers, of which an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity is u&s;ed by every &s;hopkeeper in pack|ages, &amp;c. the&s;e are made chiefly of oakum, that is, old hempen ropes. A fine paper is made in China of &s;ilk.</P>

<P>I have heard lately of woven Pa|per; pray what is that? they cannot weave Paper, &s;urely!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your que&s;tion is very natural. In order to an&s;wer it, I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to take a &s;heet of common Paper, and
<PB N="146" REF="151">
hold it up again&s;t the light. Do not you &s;ee marks in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee a great many white lines running along lengthways, like ribs, and &s;maller that cro&s;s them. I &s;ee, too, letters and the figure of a crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are all the marks of the wires; the thickne&s;s of the wire pre|vents &s;o much of the pulp lying upon the &s;heet in tho&s;e places, con&s;equently wherever the wires are, the Paper is thinner, and you &s;ee the light through more readily, which gives that appear|ance of white lines. The letters too are worked in the wire, and are the maker's name. Now to prevent the&s;e lines, which take off from the beauty of the Paper, particularly of drawing Paper, there have been lately u&s;ed moulds of bra&s;s wire exceeding fine, of equal thick|ne&s;s, and woven or latticed one within another; the marks, therefore, of the&s;e are ea&s;ily pre&s;&s;ed out, &s;o as to be hardly
<PB N="147" REF="152">
vi&s;ible; if you look at this &s;heet you will &s;ee it is quite &s;mooth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould mention to you, that there is a di&s;covery very lately made, by which they can make Paper equal to any in whitene&s;s, of the coar&s;e&s;t brown rags, and even of dyed cottons; which they have till now been obliged to throw by for inferior purpo&s;es. This is by means of mangane&s;e, a &s;ort of mineral, and oil of vitriol; a mixture of which they ju&s;t pa&s;s through the pulp, while it is in water, for otherwi&s;e it would burn it, and in an in&s;tant it di&s;|charges the colours of the dyed cloths, and bleaches the brown to a beautiful whitene&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is like what you told me before of bleaching cloth in a few hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed founded upon the &s;ame di&s;covery. The Paper made of
<PB N="148" REF="153">
the&s;e brown rags is likewi&s;e more va|luable, from being very tough and &s;trong, almo&s;t like parchment.</P>

<P>When was the making of Paper found out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a di&s;puted point, but proba|bly in the fourteenth century. The in|vention has been of almo&s;t equal con|&s;equence to literature, as that of print|ing it&s;elf; and &s;hows how the arts and &s;ciences, like children of the &s;ame fa|mily, mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t and bring forward each other.</P>

<P>Still, what are you but a <HI>robber</HI>&mdash;a ba&s;e di&s;hone&s;t <HI>robber?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is a <HI>conqueror?</HI> Have not you, too, gone about the earth like an evil genius, bla&s;ting the fair fruits of peace and indu&s;try;&mdash;plundering, ra|vi&s;hing, killing, without law, without ju&s;tice, merely to gratify an in&s;atiable lu&s;t for dominion? All that I have done to a &s;ingle di&s;trict with a hundred fol|lowers,
<PB N="151" REF="156">
you have done to whole nations with a hundred thou&s;and. If I have &s;tripped individuals, you have ruined kings and princes. If I have burned a few hamlets, you have de&s;olated the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing kingdoms and cities of the earth. What is then the differ|ence, but that as you were born a king, and I a private man, you have been able to become a mightier <HI>robber</HI> than I?</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I have taken like a king, I have given like a king. If I have &s;ubverted empires, I have founded greater. I have cheri&s;hed arts, com|merce, and philo&s;ophy.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, too, have freely given to the poor, what I took from the rich. I have e&s;tabli&s;hed order and di&s;cipline among the mo&s;t ferocious of mankind; and have &s;tretched out my protecting arm over the oppre&s;&s;ed. I know, in|deed, little of the philo&s;ophy you talk
<PB N="152" REF="157">
of; but I believed neither you nor I &s;hall ever repay to the world the mi&s;|chiefs we have done it.</P>

<P>Leave me&mdash;Take off his chains, and u&s;e him well. <STAGE>(Exit Robber.)</STAGE>  &mdash;Are we then &s;o much alike?&mdash;Alex|ander to a robber?&mdash;Let me reflect.</P>
