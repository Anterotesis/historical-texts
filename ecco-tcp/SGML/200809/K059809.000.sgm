<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE un&s;ufferable Behaviour of Ser|vants in this Nation is now (it may be hop'd) come to its Height; their Mea&s;ure of In&s;olence, I think, may be &s;aid to be quite full.</P>
<P>Private Families have &s;truggled long with it; the injur'd Reputation of Ma&s;ters, Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, Young-Ladies, and Gentlemen, which has lain &s;o long at the Mercy of their Servants Tongues, has groan'd under it; the Patience of the Heads of Families, under the Rudene&s;s and In&s;ults they have &s;uffer'd, has been enough, and indeed too much provok'd; the poor Husbandman, Ar|tificer, and Manufacturer, have &s;uffer'd &s;uffi|ciently; <HI>in a Word,</HI> the Grievance is become national, and calls aloud for a Remedy.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, in the Beginning of this Work, I &s;eem'd to &s;tand alone in the Complaint, and &s;ome to whom I &s;hew'd the&s;e <HI>Sheets,</HI> tho' they own'd the Fact, did not think it important enough to appear; that it was below the Dignity of the Pen, and wou'd not influence the World, as I hop'd it wou'd, to attempt a Cure.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e Gentlemen are &s;ince convinc'd of their Mi&s;take, and that they did not think it was an Evil of &s;o exten&s;ive a Nature as it now appears to be; they thought it only regarded
<PB N="2" REF="3">
a few Citizens Wives, and Trade&s;mens Hou&s;e-Maids, or a few Gentlemens Footmen, <HI>and the like;</HI> they did not imagine, that the Hu&s;band|men are ruin'd, the Farmers di&s;abled, Manu|facturers and Artificers plung'd, to the De|&s;truction of Trade, and Stagnation of their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and that no Men who, in the Cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s, employ Numbers of the Poor, can depend upon any Contracts they make, or per|form any-thing they undertake, having no Law, no Power to enforce their Agreement, or to ob|lige the Poor to perform hone&s;tly what they are hir'd to do, tho' ever &s;o ju&s;tly paid for doing it</P>
<P>They did not con&s;ider, that the Peace of Fa|milies is ruin'd; all Hou&s;hold Di&s;cipline at a full Stop; and that &s;uch innumerable Di&s;orders are the Con&s;equences of this one Grievance; that there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;peedy Application for a Remedy.</P>
<P>But in the middle of this Undertaking, and after this Work had been a con&s;iderable time in the Pre&s;s, I had the Satisfaction to &s;ee, that the whole Repre&s;entative Body of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> concurr'd with my Opinion; and that which to &s;ome &s;eem'd not important enough for a Book of Complaint, was found &s;o &s;ignificant, as that the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> thought it worth while to take it into their Con&s;ideration, and to re&s;olve upon Mea&s;ures for its Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>May tho&s;e Re&s;olutions end, as we have Rea|&s;on to hope they will, in &s;uch Laws as &s;hall effect|ually deliver us from this Burthen, which, I have too much Rea&s;on to &s;ay is become intollerable to to the whole Nation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT was formerly &s;aid of <HI>England,</HI> by way of Proverb, That it was <HI>the Hell of Hor&s;es, the Purgatory of Servants and the Paradi&s;e of</HI> Women; what might be the Ca&s;e in former Days, I know not, but I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s (as things &s;tand now) I &s;ee no ju&s;t Rea&s;on for that way of Speaking,</P>
<P>As for <HI>the Hor&s;es,</HI> I &s;hall not trouble you much upon that Subject; 'tis certain, they have as great a quantity of Hor&s;e-fle&s;h here, as any Nation in the World, and as good a
<PB N="2" REF="5">
Kind, if not better, con&s;idering that they excel in the Breeds of all the &s;orts of Hor|&s;es together, whereas other Nations are &s;in|glar to a &s;ort; &s;ome Nations have fine &s;hap'd Hor&s;es, as Spani&s;h <HI>Genets and Barbs,</HI> &s;ome &s;wift Gallopers, as the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> &s;ome &s;trong and va&s;tly large, Coach-Hor&s;es, as in <HI>Handers,</HI> &s;ome good Draught-Hor&s;es, as the <HI>Swi&s;s;</HI> others good Cuira&s;&s;iers, or Char|ging Hor&s;es, as in <HI>Hol&s;tein;</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> but <HI>England</HI> excels in all the Kinds together, and no Nation goes beyond them.</P>
<P>It is true, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s for Hor&s;es, and that almo&s;t in all Parts of the I&s;land: They have but little Inland Navigation, and therefore not only their Husbandry requires the Labour of their Cattle, but mo&s;t part of the heavy Goods, which are carried from Place to Place, in Trade, are carried by Land; &s;uch as Gro|cery-Ware, Corn, Meal, Malt, Wine, Oyl, Wool, and Woolen-Manufacturies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Al&s;o in many Places even their Metals and Minerals, &s;uch as <HI>Lead, Iron, Copper, wrought Iron, Stones,</HI> and even <HI>Coals,</HI> and <HI>Salt,</HI> and other weighty and bulky Goods are car|ried by Land-Carriage; &s;o that the Hor&s;es in <HI>England</HI> do really work very hard, and this, perhaps, may be the Cau&s;e of the old Saying, that <HI>England</HI> is the <HI>Hell of Hor&s;es,</HI> tho' I do not think it is ju&s;t neither, for this may really be &s;aid in the Ca&s;e,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
that as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> work their Hor&s;es very hard, &s;o generally &s;peaking, they feed them very well, and take Care of them well al&s;o, and that better than in mo&s;t Countries that I have been in; &s;o I do not think it can be &s;aid, 'tis the Hell of Hor&s;es; <HI>but that by the way.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>the Women,</HI> and <HI>England's</HI> being <HI>the Paradi&s;e</HI> of Women, it chiefly relates to the good Cu&s;toms and ancient Laws made in behalf of <HI>the Ladies,</HI> by which they have better Provi&s;ions made for them by the Law, with re&s;pect to their Claim to the E&s;tates, and the Effects of their Husbands, after Death, and to the Right of Divi&s;ion among the Heirs in Per&s;onal E&s;tates, and in &s;ome Copy-holds, and to a Right of Coheir&s;hip by the <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of &s;everal Tenures, and in &s;everal Cities and Corporations, and the like, I &s;ay, better than in other Countries.</P>
<P>But if we come to talk of <HI>the good U&s;age of Wives</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> whether we &s;peak of the generality of the Nation, or of particular Per&s;ons, I have not &s;o much to &s;ay for them as perhaps they may expect; the good Treatment of Wives in <HI>England</HI> is not &s;uch, as may be much boa&s;ted of at pre&s;ent; nor am I of the Opinion of the antient Writers here, that u&s;ed to boa&s;t of the Women of <HI>England, that if there was a Bridge over the</HI> Narrow-Seas, <HI>all the Women in</HI> Chri&s;tendom <HI>would run over into England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">
In the fir&s;t Place I mu&s;t acknowledge, that &s;ince Drunkenne&s;s is &s;o much encrea&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> to which we owe a great many other ill Cu&s;toms which were never known in <HI>England</HI> before; I &s;ay, &s;ince this terrible eruption of Drinking in <HI>England,</HI> the U&s;age of Wives in this Country is much alter'd from what it us'd to be in former Times, and even in a few Years pa&s;t: You can not doubt, but that Flood of Infatuation which has &s;pread over the whole Kingdom in the manner I &s;hall inform you of in its Turn, has had its Effect, not only upon the Morals, but even upon the Sences and good Manners of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; the very Blood and Nature of Men &s;eems to be chang'd; with their Temperance they have lo&s;t their Temper, and with their Virtue &s;o much of their good Humour, for which they us'd to be &s;o fam'd, that they &s;eem to be quite another Kind of People than their Ance&s;tors were u&s;ually &s;aid to be, and even than I my&s;elf remember them to be.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Days, as the ancient Fathers have reported things, <HI>at lea&s;t to</HI> me, there was a Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s among them, which I can &s;ee little of now, <HI>e&s;pecially for the Women;</HI> they generally treated them with a courteous, kind, and re&s;pectful Manner, dif|ferent in many things from other Nations; and it is to this kind benevolent Temper, to which we owe all the antient Con&s;titutions, made in favour of the Women, which they
<PB N="5" REF="8">
talk &s;o much of, and with &s;o good Rea&s;on, <HI>in England;</HI> for, <HI>in &s;hort</HI> you &s;ee very little done in their behalf in the la&s;t fifty or &s;ixty Years, nay, not in the la&s;t Century, nor have they any great Pro&s;pect of new Favours; 'tis well if they can retain the Privileges which the good-humour'd Ages of their Ance&s;tors left them po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of.</P>
<P>For now the Ca&s;e is quite alter'd, Family-Government is exceedingly chang'd, if not inverted, and the Men grow rigid, &s;urly, cruel, tyrannick, and outrageous; <HI>in a Word,</HI> as it is the Cau&s;e of all the re&s;t, &s;o the Word may well comprehend all the re&s;t, <HI>they grow Drunken,</HI> and when I &s;ay that, I have &s;aid all.</P>
<P>The Effect of this is &s;een abundance of Ways in their Families, for 'tis of that I am now &s;peaking, and particularly of their Conduct, and Treatment of their Wives; that they grow Sotti&s;h and Stupid, more than ever, and by that &s;ordid way of living, drink away their Under&s;tandings, and even their Sences al&s;o, to &s;ay nothing of their Sub&s;tance and E&s;tates; by this they become Bruti&s;h, and Sour in their Families, and at be&s;t de|prive their Wives and Daughters, not only of their Care and Management, on which the Pro&s;perity of Families &s;o much depends, but of the Solace and Comfort of their re|lation, of their Company, and of all that Enjoyment which derives from what we call a Social Life.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
As Drunkenne&s;s has encreas'd, &s;o indeed, the Comfort and Family-Happine&s;s of the Women in <HI>England</HI> are decreas'd in Propor|tion, and in that very Article their <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> if they had one before, is in my Opinion, very much alter'd, and mo&s;t of the Plea&s;ure of it lo&s;t.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for as Extremes follow one another, and one ill Habit may have a hundred ill Con&s;equences, &s;o this new U&s;age of Drinking as it Stupifies and makes Sots of &s;ome, &s;o in others it affects the Pa&s;&s;ions, fires the Blood, rai&s;es their Spleen, and &s;ends Men home to their Families mad and out|regeous; &s;o that in&s;tead of the kind, mild, and affable Temper, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation u&s;ed to be fam'd for, <HI>as to their Wives,</HI> the Men are now made a Terror to them, and to their whole Families, rageing, &s;torming, and quarreling, and too often fighting; &s;o that if you will believe them&s;elves, the Ca&s;e of the Women in <HI>England</HI> is truly Deplora|ble, and there is &s;carce a good Husband now to twenty that merited that Name in former Times; nor was beating of Wives ever &s;o much the U&s;age in <HI>England,</HI> as it is now; the Dif|ference is manife&s;t, and they tell me, that 'tis &s;o frequent now, e&s;pecially among the meaner &s;ort of People, that to hear a Woman cry Murther now, &s;carce gives any Alarm; the Neighbours &s;carce &s;tir at it, and if they do, if they come out in a Fright, and ask one another what's the Matter, and where is it
<PB N="7" REF="10">
that they cry Murther? the common An&s;wer to one another is only thus; 'tis nothing Neighbour, but <HI>&s;uch a one</HI> a beating his Wife; O <HI>dear,</HI> &s;ays the other, <HI>is that all?</HI> and in they go again, compos'd and ea&s;ie, as hearing a thing of no great Con&s;equence, that has no great Novelty in it, nor much Danger, and what, if it had, they don't much care to meddle with; in a word, 'tis &s;o common a thing now, to bully and abu&s;e their Wives when they are in Drink, that I believe I may &s;ay, there are very few Men get Drunk, but that they do quarrel with, beat, or mi&s;u&s;e their Wives, one way or other: If this be their <HI>Engli&s;h Paradi&s;e,</HI> the Women here may enjoy it by them&s;elves; I believe none of the Wives in our Country will trouble them, or crowd in upon them for a Share of the Enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>But this is not my pre&s;ent De&s;ign neither; the Women's Ca&s;e is too long for this Un|dertaking, and de&s;erves to be con&s;ider'd by it|&s;elf: It is added, that as <HI>England</HI> is the <HI>Para|di&s;e of Women,</HI> &s;o it is the <HI>Purgatory of Ser|vants:</HI> This I object again&s;t, more than I do that of Women, nay, I exclaim again&s;t it; nothing is more certain, than that as the Wo|men's Ca&s;e is made wor&s;e by the change of their U&s;age among us, &s;o that of the Servants is infinitely varied the other Way; and we mu&s;t allow, that the Proverb &s;hould be turn'd, and we &s;hould &s;ay, it is the <HI>Purgatory of Wives,</HI> and the <HI>Paradi&s;e of Servants;</HI> and this is the
<PB N="8" REF="11">
Subject I intend to entertain you with for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Nothing is more vi&s;ible, nor indeed, breaks in &s;o far upon our Civil Affairs in this Na|tion, as the &s;urprizing Difference that there is in the Behaviour of Servants of every Rank and Degree among us, from what it was in former Times; from what it is now in other Nations; and from what, indeed, in the Na|ture of the thing, ought to be every-where: The Complaint is &s;o general, and the Grie|vance &s;o very notorious, that I need enter in|to no Search after Evidence of Fact; I &s;hall therefore, give you &s;ome general Account of it in this Letter, and de&s;cend to Particulars hereafter.</P>
<P>By Servants you are to under&s;tand me to mean, the &s;everal Denominations hereafter mention'd; for I am not going to entertain you with a long Complaint of a few Footmen, and Cook-wenches, but the Grievance po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the whole Body of the Nation; and all that bear the Name of Servant, may be &s;aid to be more or le&s;s concern'd.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Apprentices, as well the Apprentices to Merchants, and more eminent Trades-Men, as the Apprentices to meaner People; &s;uch as Shop-Keepers, Handicrafts Arti|ficers, Manufacturers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Menial Servants</HI> &s;uch as Cooks, Gar|deners, Butlers, Coachmen, Grooms, Footmen, Pages, Maid-Servants, Nur&s;es,
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all kept within Doors, at Bed and Board; that is to &s;ay, &s;uch as have Yearly or Monthly Wages, with Meat, Drink, Lodging, and Wa&s;hing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Clerks to Lawyers, Attorneys, Scriveners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to Gentlemen in publick Offices, and the like; I &s;hall &s;peak of the La|bouring Poor, that is, of Servants <HI>without Doors,</HI> in a Letter by it&s;elf; for I have much al&s;o to &s;ay of them, I a&s;&s;ure you.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In every one of the&s;e there appears a vi&s;ible and important Difference, in almo&s;t every Article, which relate to them as Servants; by Difference I mean, between them and Servants of the &s;ame Cla&s;s in former Years.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e, already nam'd, I mean <HI>Merchants Apprentices,</HI> and <HI>Lawyers Clerks,</HI> might indeed, be &s;aid always to have &s;ome particular Regard &s;hew'd them, as being oftentimes the Sons of con&s;iderable Families, bred &s;omething above the ordinary Rate of Servants, and that gave large Sums to their Ma&s;ters, in order to be introduc'd into a capital Bu&s;ine&s;s, which they were likely to have con&s;iderable Stocks of their own to carry on; yet the&s;e differ too very much.</P>
<P>In former times it was u&s;ual to give great Sums, I &s;ay, with Apprentices to Merchants, but then tho&s;e Sums were call'd great in tho&s;e times, which are accounted but &s;mall Sums now; the Rea&s;on of that I need not examine;
<PB N="10" REF="13">
however, I &s;ay great Sums were given to principal Merchants; as particularly 200<HI>l.</HI> and &s;ometimes, but very rarely, and more lately 300<HI>l.</HI> to eminent <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants; To the more con&s;iderable <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants, from 100<HI>l.</HI> to 150<HI>l.</HI> and the&s;e were the fir&s;t-rate <HI>Premio's</HI> that were given in the City of <HI>London,</HI> for about 50 or 60 Years ago, nor, if I am inform'd Right, was ever more than 100<HI>l.</HI> given with an Apprentice to the be&s;t <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> before the Year 1640, or thereabout; and to other Merchants &s;uch as <HI>Dutch, French, Hamburg,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-Country</HI> Merchants, in Proportion; to Shop-keepers of the fir&s;t Rank, as Linnen and Woollen-Drapers, Mercers, whole&s;ale Grocers, and other con&s;iderable Dealers, 50<HI>l.</HI> and afterwards 100<HI>l.</HI> and &s;o of other Trades in their Proportion al&s;o.</P>
<P>But now &s;uch a &s;trange Change is there upon the Face of things, that 'tis very ordinary to give a thou&s;and Pound with an Apprentice to a <HI>Turkey-</HI>Merchant, 400<HI>l.</HI> to 600<HI>l.</HI> to other Merchants; from 200 to 300 to Shop-keepers, and whole&s;ale Dealers, Linnen-Drapers e&s;pe|cially; and &s;o in Proportion to other Trades, and the like with Clerks to Lawyers, Attor|nies, Scriveners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As the <HI>Premio's</HI> given with &s;uch Servants as the&s;e, are thus &s;trangely differing from what was formerly done, &s;o the U&s;age of the&s;e kinds of Servants, in the Families where they are taken, differs al&s;o; and &s;o in Pro|portion
<PB N="11" REF="14">
does their Services they are employ'd in differ; it may be alledg'd, that upon their Ma&s;ters demanding &s;uch great Sums of Money with their Apprentices, they have rea&s;on to treat them as Gentlemen, and not as Servants; to let them &s;ee that they are rather brought into their Counting-Hou&s;es as Pupils to a Tu|tor, and Scholars, or Students to a College, than as Servants; that their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to be introduc'd hand&s;omely and reputably into Bu|&s;ine&s;s, &s;ent Abroad, and receiv'd into the management of Affairs, and not indeed, to be accounted, or call'd Servants, or to be us'd as &s;uch; and this may be granted; but &s;till it breaks into the great Foundation, the Rule of <HI>Subordination,</HI> which I &s;ay is e&s;&s;ential to all Family-Oeconomy, and the&s;e Youths &s;hould be called Lodgers, not Apprentices or Ser|vants; for as their coming in differs, <HI>as above,</HI> in a much greater Proportion does their Be|haviour and Conduct differ; the Con&s;equence of which, in a great mea&s;ure, is, that more of them are ruin'd, debauch'd, and come to nothing, for want of Subordination, and being under Government, than was wont to be the Ca&s;e; to the great Calamity of their Families, e&s;pecially of their Parents, of which abun|dince of lamentable Examples might be given; but neither is this the particular De&s;ign of the&s;e Letters, which is more e&s;pecially to give you a Sketch of <HI>Low-Life,</HI> and de|&s;cribe to you the horrible degencracy of the meaner &s;ort of Servants, and the mi&s;chiefs
<PB N="12" REF="15">
which this Nation &s;uffers upon that Ac|count.</P>
<P>From the&s;e kinds of Servants therefore, <HI>I mean Apprentices to Merchants, Whole&s;ale-Men, and the like,</HI> I mu&s;t de&s;cend to the Apprentices of meaner Trade&s;men, and yet not of the labouring Trades neither, that is to &s;ay, the Handicrafts, Artificers, and the like, they remain to be mention'd by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is but few Years ago, and in the Memory of many now living, that all the Apprentices of the Shop-keepers and Warehou&s;e-keepers, as well in <HI>London,</HI> as in other Places, except the few mention'd before, &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t &s;ervile Employments of the Families in which they &s;erv'd; &s;uch as the <HI>young Gentry,</HI> their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors in the the &s;ame Station, &s;corn &s;o much as the Name of now; &s;uch as <HI>cleaning</HI> their Ma&s;ters Shoes, bringing <HI>Water</HI> into the Hou&s;es <HI>from the Conduits</HI> in the Street, which they carried on their Shoulders in long Ve&s;&s;els call'd Tankards; al&s;o waiting at Table, wait|ing on their Ma&s;ters to the Church, and carrying their Bibles, Prayer-Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and many more &s;uch things; <HI>whereas now</HI> the Apprentices of the very &s;ame Cla&s;s, are &s;o far from &s;tooping to &s;uch things as the&s;e, that 'tis very rarely that they will conde&s;cend to open or &s;hut the Shop-windows, much le&s;s to &s;weep the Shop, or Ware-hou&s;es; but their Ma&s;ters are oblig'd to keep Porters or Footmen to wait upon the Apprentices, and do all tho&s;e things for them; &s;o far are they

now from cleaning their Ma&s;ters Shoes, that the Apprentices &s;corn to clean their own Shoes; but there are poor Women generally attending at the Shop-Doors, to do tho&s;e things, as well for the Apprentices as for the Ma&s;ters, and are paid for it; &s;o far are they from being &s;ubjected to their Ma&s;ters, or to their Family Di&s;cipline, that they think it hard to have any Enquiry made after them when they go out, and keep oftentimes later Hours than their Ma&s;ters; and as often are pleas'd to come home in Drink, which al&s;o their Ma&s;ters have &s;carce the Authority to re&s;ent, or que&s;tion them about.</P>
<P>This un&s;ufferable <HI>Liberty,</HI> is not &s;o much granted by the Ma&s;ter, as it is a&s;&s;um'd by the Apprentices; and if at any times Words hap|pen between them, 'tis very &s;eldom but that the Servant is as high as the Ma&s;ter, and &s;cor|ning to give an Account of his Excur&s;ions, takes it very ill to be examin'd, and much wor&s;e to be re&s;train'd; and tho' perhaps, they may reply in Language a little more decent than meaner Fellows talk in, yet they &s;hall not fail to tell their Ma&s;ters, they did not give &s;uch Sums of Money to be confin'd like Pri|&s;oners, or to be u&s;ed like Foot-boys; and that if they (the Ma&s;ters) do not like their Service, (as they wou'd call it) they are willing to be otherwi&s;e di&s;pos'd of; not forgetting to add, that if the Ma&s;ter con&s;ents to Part with them, they expect Part of their Money back again, <HI>and the like;</HI> intimating, that the Ma&s;ter will

bear with their Di&s;orders, rather than part with them, and refund.</P>
<P>The Effect of this In&s;olence, for I can call it no le&s;s, is, that there are more of the&s;e Servants, call'd Apprentices, ruin'd by the&s;e <HI>Liberties,</HI> than one would think it was po&s;&s;ible cou'd be found in the whole City; all manner of Wick|edne&s;&s;es are practi&s;ed by them; and as they are generally but Youths, have their Pockets unadvi&s;edly &s;upplied with Monies by their Relations, and thus a&s;&s;ume Time and <HI>Liberty</HI> to &s;pend it, they indulge them&s;elves in all &s;orts of <HI>Liberties:</HI> This has been &s;o Examplar on many Occa&s;ions, that never was &s;o many Ma&s;|ters robb'd by their Apprentices as now; and I think I might give an Account of 11 or 12 young Clerks and Apprentices, that have been Hang'd here in <HI>London,</HI> or near it, within the&s;e few Years, be&s;ides innumerable others, ruin'd by the many &s;everal Ways of being undone; of which this Town affords them per|haps more, than any other Place in the World.</P>
<P>The next Head, or Cla&s;s, is, that of the lower <HI>Menial Servants;</HI> and here, whatever is the Occa&s;ion, we find the Wages of almo&s;t all &s;orts of Servants doubled, and of &s;ome treb|bled, as in the Article before; but for the Behaviour of the&s;e People, their Saucine&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, and abu&s;ive Language on the &s;ide of the Men-Servants; the gaiety, fine Cloaths, Laces, Hoops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Maid-Servants, nay, even to Patches and Paint, are hardly to be de&s;crib'd; it would be a Satyr

upon the Ladies, &s;uch as perhaps, they would not bear the reading of, &s;hould we go about to tell, how hard it is &s;ometimes to know the Chamber-Maid from her Mi&s;tre&s;s; or my Lady's Chief-Woman from one of my Lady's Daughters; nor can &s;he bear to be call'd any thing le&s;s than Mi&s;tre&s;s by the re&s;t of the Ser|vants; or is it altogether improper; as I &s;hall &s;hew in its Place.</P>
<P>From this gaiety of Dre&s;s, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow Encrea&s;e of Wages, for where there is &s;uch an Expence in Habit, there mu&s;t be a proportion'd Supply of Money, or it will not do.</P>
<P>The Pocket thus furni&s;h'd, and the Back thus cloath'd, and the Servant thus exalted, how can it be expected &s;he &s;hou'd not be above her&s;elf, much more above her Bu&s;ine&s;s, and mo&s;t of all, <HI>which is to my Purpo&s;e,</HI> above Reproof; to be talk'd to, is to hear how Saucy &s;he can be, and as &s;he is impatient of being told when &s;he is in a Fault, &s;o &s;he is &s;ure to be in as many &s;uch Faults, as ever Servants can be &s;uppos'd to have been.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEing, <HI>as by my la&s;t,</HI> to give you &s;ome Account of the Conduct of <HI>Low-Life</HI> in this Country, <HI>where it differs &s;o much from all the re&s;t of the World,</HI> I propos'd to be|gin it by way of Preliminary, that as I have already laid down Heads of the Grievance in general, &s;o I may now lead you a little to the Fountain from whence it flows, and the manife&s;t Degrees by which it is &s;well'd to &s;uch a Height, as almo&s;t to overwhelm the National Oeconomy, and embarra&s;s our Families in con&s;tant Vexation and Di&s;order.</P>
<P>As I hinted in my la&s;t, the mi&s;erable Circum&s;tance of this Country is now &s;uch, that, in &s;hort, if it goes on, the Poor will be Rulers over the Rich, and the Servants be Governours of their Ma&s;ters; the <HI>Plebeij</HI> have almo&s;t mobb'd the <HI>Patricij;</HI> and as the Commons, in another Ca&s;e, may be &s;aid to be gotten above the Lords, &s;o the Cannaille of this Nation impo&s;e Laws upon their Superiours, and begin not only to be trou|ble&s;ome, but in time, may be dangerous; in a word, Order is inverted, Subordination cea&s;es, and the World &s;eems to &s;tand with the Bottom upward.</P>
<P>How and by what Steps things have been brought to this Height, and from whence all
<PB N="18" REF="21">
this Di&s;order proceeds, <HI>tho' it may be Difficult to find out all the Springs and Cau&s;es which have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it,</HI> yet &s;ome Part of it may be &s;een in the following Particulars, which are the Preliminaries I mentioned in my la&s;t.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. AS the People here are univer&s;ally ble&s;s'd with real and valuable <HI>LIBERTY,</HI> more than any Nation in the World, SO the common &s;ort are withal &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with mi&s;taken Notions of that LIBERTY in general, and of their own <HI>Legal Liberties</HI> in Particular, that it runs them upon the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous Follies ima|ginable; particularly abu&s;ing that <HI>Liberty</HI> to indulge their Wickedne&s;s; &s;ugge&s;ting that Liberty is a Freedom to Crime, not a Security again&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. AS the common People, <HI>not Exclu&s;ive of a great Part of the Nobility and Gentry,</HI> are mi&s;erably overwhelm'd in a Dreadful Innundation of Vice and Immorality; infinitely more than was the Ca&s;e in former Days; SO the particular Vices which are mo&s;t concern'd in the pre&s;ent Complaint, are tho&s;e two above all the re&s;t, <HI>namely</HI> Drunkene&s;s, and prophane Swearing</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To the Account of the&s;e two, I place the Guilt of almo&s;t all the Evils that I am now to &s;peak of, what additional Helps may have
<PB N="19" REF="22">
been had from other and le&s;&s;er Excur&s;ions of the Poor mi&s;erable People, who I am going to de&s;cribe, I may &s;peak to as I go on: I will not &s;ay but that as all the little Brooks and Currents de&s;cending from the ri&s;ing Grounds adjacent to a River, a&s;&s;i&s;t to &s;well the Stream of that River into a Flood, &s;o there may be many other &s;maller Helps from Hell, to prompt the ruin of a Nation's Peace; but the&s;e two like the principal Channels, &s;upport the main Current.</P>
<P>It is from the&s;e that the Pa&s;&s;ions are rais'd, Men put out of their own Government, and the general Temper of the People, as I &s;aid in my la&s;t, chang'd and alter'd; it is from hence that Calm, that Sobriety, that Kindne&s;s, and goodne&s;s of Humour which formerly was the fam'd Di&s;po&s;ition of the People of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>chang'd,</HI> and become <HI>violent</HI> and <HI>outrageous,</HI> from the&s;e come contempt of Government, quar|rellings, and fighting with one another; in&s;ul|ting Ma&s;ters, Employers, and every Degree of Superiors; and, in a word, innumerable other Di&s;orders, to the breaking off all manner of Di&s;cipline and Regulation, the abu&s;e of them|&s;elves, and the de&s;troying the common Peace and good Neighbourhood of the People one with another.</P>
<P>If in de&s;cribing this, I come to let you &s;ee the &s;everal Steps, by which the&s;e things have encroach'd upon the Conduct of the meaner Sort among as; how, and by what fatal Degrees their Manners were fir&s;t de|prav'd, and to what Extreme they are &s;ince
<PB N="20" REF="23">
hurried on; I flatter my&s;elf, it will be both diverting and informing, and you will not think your time lo&s;t in reading my Letters; how|ever tedious they may otherwi&s;e be.</P>
<P><HI>LIBERTT</HI> is the Glory of an <HI>Engli&s;hman;</HI> 'tis as Natural to him to de&s;ire it, as 'tis lawful to him to maintain it; 'tis his Inheri|tance, purchas'd with the Blood of his An|ce&s;tors, and as 'tis his Portion, &s;o 'tis his Pride; but 'tis with an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> about his Liberty, as 'tis with many of them about Popery; there is a kind of national Aver&s;ion among them to Popery; 'tis the univer&s;al Scare-crow, the Hobgoblin, the Spectre with which the Nur&s;es fright the Children, and entertain the old Wo|men all over the Country, by which means &s;uch horror po&s;e&s;&s;es the Minds of the common People about it, that I believe there are an 100000 &s;tout Fellows, who would &s;pend the la&s;t Drop of their Blood again&s;t Popery, that do not know whether it be a Man or a Hor&s;e,</P>
<P>In like manner <HI>Liberty</HI> is a word of Endear|ment, 'tis the Hereditary Favourite of the People; 'tis the Nation's Mi&s;tre&s;s, I was a going to &s;ay it was the Nation's Whore; in a Word, 'tis talk'd of by every-body, valu'd by every-body, and under&s;tood almo&s;t by no-body; this <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty is as blindly e&s;pous'd, as I &s;aid Popery was blindly hated by tho&s;e who mi&s;take it in the gro&s;e&s;t manner.</P>
<P>This leads me to the Conduct of our igno|rant People, in the claim they make to this thing call'd <HI>Liberty,</HI> and their &s;candalous Ma|nagement of it on many Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24">
Pray take me right as I go along, that I am talking now chiefly of the common People, tho' tis too true, that even among the better Sort there are too many, who&s;e Notions of Liberty are not only incon&s;i&s;tent with true Liberty, but de&s;tructive of it; for nothing is more certain, than that true Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in a freedom to do well, not giving a Loo&s;e to the Pa&s;&s;ions, gratifying every vitious Gu&s;t, and taking off the Re&s;traint of Laws, leav|ing every Man to do what is right in his own Eyes.</P>
<P>What the People's Notions of Liberty are, I &s;hall be&s;t de&s;cribe, by giving you &s;ome hi&s;torical Examples of the Behaviour among the Common People, &s;uch as have come within the compa&s;s of my own Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> is certainly, in its con&s;tituted Li|berties, the be&s;t Nation for any Subject in the World to live in, where the Laws, which are their Protection, are likewi&s;e their Inhe|ritance; but then, for the contempt of tho&s;e Laws, and abu&s;e of Liberty, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that no Nation I have been in, comes up to them: I'll venture to give you a double Example of this in one and the &s;ame Story; the Ca&s;e hap|pen'd with in the Verge of my own Hou&s;e, and among my own Neighbours, as follows:</P>
<P>You know there are very &s;evere Laws again&s;t prophane Swearing in this Country, and the Legi&s;lature, to do them Ju&s;tice, have often repeated tho&s;e Laws, <HI>and to add to their Sanction,</HI> have made additional Clau&s;es, to oblige the Magi&s;trate to put tho&s;e Laws in Execution,
<PB N="22" REF="25">
and yet I believe <HI>Common or Cu&s;tomary Swearing</HI> is no where in the World more frequent and that of a Kind particular to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, or perhaps to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, namely, to imprecate Damnation upon them&s;elves; a thing not only highly prophane and wicked, but ab&s;urdly &s;o, e&s;pecially in that way they practi&s;e it here.</P>
<P>Several Nations are addicted to the wicked Cu&s;tom of Cur&s;ing, be&s;ides <HI>England;</HI> and e&s;pecially when they are angry with, or pro|vok'd at a Per&s;on, but then they will cur&s;e that Per&s;on pretty freely, and 'tis too much the Practice in common Di&s;cour&s;e to cur&s;e one another; <HI>but here</HI> when a Man is angry with another, he cur&s;es him&s;elf; he does not &s;ay <HI>Damn you Sir,</HI> but <HI>Damn me, Sir;</HI> which is one of the fooli&s;he&s;t as well as wickede&s;t Ways of Speaking, that can be imagin'd.</P>
<P>Now this way of &s;wearing and cur&s;ing is &s;o frequent here, among all &s;orts of People, that I believe I do the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> no Wrong in &s;aying, no Nation in <HI>Europe</HI> are guilty of it to &s;uch a Degree of Madne&s;s and Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Nor is this the Vice of the common People only, but 'tis among the Gentry, the Quality, and which is &s;till wor&s;e, the Magi&s;trates; &s;o that nothing is more frequent than to hear tho&s;e very Men &s;wear, who the Law obliges by Virtue of their Office, to puni&s;h Men for &s;wearing; in a word, the Law is not executed, becau&s;e tho&s;e who have the executive Power of the Law in their Hands, are guilty of the very Crime which they ought to puni&s;h; and
<PB N="23" REF="26">
this I Mention here, becau&s;e it brings on the Story I refer to above, which is a double Ex|ample as well of the Contempt of the Law again&s;t &s;wearing, as of the fal&s;e Notion of Liberty.</P>
<P>I had a little Affair one Day with a Gen|tleman here, that is my Neighbour, which occa&s;ion'd &s;ome Words between us, but the Interpo&s;ition of Friends &s;topt it, before it came to any Height, and we are &s;ince that, very good Friends again; <HI>but I name it on this Ac|count,</HI> my Neighbour's Servant had let &s;ome Hor&s;es break into my Ground, and I had fre|quently cau&s;ed them to be only turn'd out again, without any Complaint, other than &s;peaking to the Servant to prevent it for the future; but I was &s;urpriz'd afterwards, to find that the Servant was &s;o far from endeavouring to prevent it, that in the Night he turn'd his Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;es in him&s;elf, and a Per&s;on I &s;et to watch him took him in the Fact.</P>
<P>Upon this I Pounded the Hor&s;es, and went to my Neighbour and complain'd, but in&s;tead of finding him ready to do me Ju&s;tice, I ob|&s;erv'd him very much concernd about it, took it very ill that I &s;hou'd Pound his Cattle, began to ju&s;tifie his Servant, and added, that he was a very hone&s;t Fellow: I was &s;urpriz'd at that, and when he &s;aid his Man was very Hone&s;t, I told him, I did not believe him to be an hone&s;t Fellow.</P>
<P>He lo&s;t his Patience at this, and with a Heat, no otherwi&s;e to be expre&s;t, than by re|peating
<PB N="24" REF="27">
his mad Words, reply'd, <HI>Dam me Sir,</HI> what d'ye mean? not believe me, <HI>Dam me,</HI> what not believe me, <HI>Dam me, Sir,</HI> I can't take that; what Sir! <HI>Dam me,</HI> do you give me the Lye? <HI>Dam me,</HI> Sir, what d'ye mean?</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Words thus awkwardly put to|gether, and &s;o repeated, he gets up, walks up and down the Room, fretting and fumeing, with twenty more <HI>Damme</HI>'s, at la&s;t he ends it all with coming up to my Teeth, and letting fly at me, with <HI>Dam me, Sir, explain your&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>I kept my &s;elf as cool as I cou'd, but was oblig'd to &s;how that I was not frighted at him, &s;o with a kind of Smile, I &s;aid, I &s;hou'd have explain'd my&s;elf with out his Damming &s;o often, if he had given me Room to crow'd in a Word among his Cur&s;es.</P>
<P>This provok'd him more than I intended it &s;hou'd, and he flew out at me then with the like Number of <HI>Damme</HI>'s all over again, or rather twice as many, for my Laughing; <HI>Dam me,</HI> Sir, what d'ye Laugh at me? and <HI>Dam me,</HI> Sir, am I to be Laught at? and the like.</P>
<P>But to carry the Tale no farther than is to the Purpo&s;e that I am writing of, I then told him the Fact, and that I had not &s;aid I did not believe him, but that I did not believe his Man was hone&s;t; and that my Rea&s;on was becau&s;e I had catch'd him opening my Gate with his own Hands, and driving the Hor&s;es into my Field, and that I had brought the Per|&s;on who &s;ee him do it, to Witne&s;s again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28">
Upon this my Neighour was as calm and as civil as cou'd be de&s;ir'd, for a-while, and begg'd my Pardon for being warm before; after which, the two Servants were call'd in, and heard, and my Man te&s;tify'd as above; his Servant impudently deny'd it, and my Man as po&s;itively affirm'd it; but with this, he flies out in the &s;ame Rage at my Man, as he was in before at me, and then it was <HI>Dam me,</HI> I won't believe a Word you &s;ay, you are a lying Dog, you &s;ee my Man denies it; my Servant then offer'd to go before a Ju&s;tice, and &s;wear it, then he flew out again, you &s;wear it! you are a Ra&s;cal, <HI>G&mdash; Dam me,</HI> I won't believe your Oath, no more than your Word, and there he went &s;torming, and &s;wearing, and rageing about the Hou&s;e, and calling my Man a thou&s;and Dogs and Villains, and between every two or three Words, was the impre|cation upon him&s;elf of <HI>G&mdash;d Dam me.</HI></P>
<P>Now, had he &s;aid always <HI>Dam you,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Dam me,</HI> tho' it had been Wicked in it &s;elf to call upon God to Damn any body, and very Unchri&s;tian too, to cur&s;e his Neighbour, yet it had had &s;ome &s;hew of Sence in it, it had not been both Wicked and Ab&s;urd too; but that it now &s;eems to be of U&s;e only to &s;how the Do|minion that our Pa&s;&s;ions have above our Rea&s;on, that they content them&s;elves to talk the gro|&s;e&s;t Non&s;ence, &s;o it does but give vent to the Rage that po&s;e&s;&s;es the Mind at that time; for they will frequently call upon God, in their Pa&s;&s;ion, in the &s;ame kind of Heat, to Damn
<PB N="26" REF="29">
their Hor&s;es, their Dogs, or any thing that offends them, whether it has a Life of Sence, or vegetative Life, or no Life at all.</P>
<P>In a word, 'tis &s;o much a Cu&s;tom now in <HI>England,</HI> to Rage, and Damn, and Cur&s;e, in this Manner, that they not only do it with|out regard to Rea&s;on and Sence, but, which is &s;till more wonderful, they do it without Thought, without being in any Pa&s;&s;ion, or under any Provocation, nay, they do it with|out Anger, and without any Di&s;ta&s;te; with|out any Evil in their De&s;ign, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> without thinking at-all, but as in meer Je&s;t and Mirth.</P>
<P>But to return to my Neighbour; as I told you, &s;ome Friends over-hearing the Quarrel, made us Friends again, as to the Matter in di&s;pute; and one of them a grave, &s;ober Gen|tleman, took the Liberty in a mannerly and courteous Manner, to &s;peak to him about his frequent &s;wearing and cur&s;ing, and how ill it was for him to do &s;o, who was a Per&s;on of Years, of Learning, and Breeding, and the like; he defended him&s;elf a-while, by &s;aying <HI>he thought no Harm,</HI> the u&s;ual Defences the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman make for it, and which generally is very true; but when the other Gentleman carry'd it a little further, and pre&s;s'd him to re&s;train him&s;elf in &s;uch unlawful Exce&s;&s;es, and he cou'd not tell what to &s;ay more than he had &s;aid, he &s;eem'd a little warm, and an&s;wer'd, Sir, I am an <HI>Engli&s;hman, and I love Liberty,</HI> pray let me alone, I mu&s;t have my <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30">
I &s;hou'd have told you, while this happen'd, my Servant, to whom, as I &s;aid he was very pa&s;&s;ionate, was mightly affronted at being call'd &s;uch ill Names, and I heard him &s;o very high among his Fellow-Servants in the next Room, that I went out to &s;ee what was the mat|ter; my Man told me, in &s;hort, that what I &s;aid to him at any time was nothing, for I was his Ma&s;ter; but he hop'd I would not expect he &s;hou'd take it from <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &mdash; that he would not be call'd Dog, and Rogue, and Ra&s;cal, by ne'er a Gentleman in the Country; that he valued his Reputation as much as <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &mdash; at any time, and that his Lively|hood depended upon it; that if he was one that would Swear any thing, and was not fit to be believ'd upon his Oath, he was not fit for any Gentleman's Service, and he cou'd not blame any Gentleman for refu&s;ing him, if he had &s;uch a Character; and therefore he was re&s;olv'd to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I knew that really all the Fellow &s;aid was true, that he was very much injur'd, and that he was, indeed, a very hone&s;t Fellow in the main, and a good Servant, as Servants in <HI>England</HI> go now; &s;o I gave him good Words, and &s;eeing he was heated, and that he had ju&s;t Cau&s;e to be a little mov'd, I endeavour'd to calm him; but I found it would not do, he in&s;i&s;ted, that he was re&s;ov'd to do him&s;elf Ju&s;|tice; why you Fool you, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what do you mean by doing your &s;elf Ju&s;tice? you don't pretend to put your&s;elf upon an equal Foot

I will do my&s;elf Right without Fighting, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> I look'd ear|ne&s;tly at him upon tho&s;e Words, <HI>What way can you take,</HI> &s;ays I? <HI>Why, Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in the fir&s;t Place, I will make him pay for &s;wearing, I hope the Law will bear me out in that.</HI></P>
<P>I mus'd awhile, and it pre&s;ently occur'd to me, that if my Man did make Oath that he &s;wore 500 times, be&s;ides his cur&s;ing, he would do him no wrong, but yet, that if he did &s;o, it would renew the Quarrel between my Neighbour and I, for he would pre&s;ently &s;ay it was all my doing; &s;o I did all that lay in my Power to per&s;wade my Man to put it up, and let him alone; be&s;ides, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> you know he is a powerful Man in this Part of the County, and if ever he meets you, he will certainly run you Thoro'; in the mean time his Men will abu&s;e you, and in&s;ult you, and you will have no fair Play with them.</P>
<P>But I found my Man was too Warm to be mov'd by all &s;uch Per&s;wa&s;ions as the&s;e; nor was that all, but he would &s;tay for the Gentle|man's coming out, to talk with him again: this I took up, and told him, I would have no Gentlman affronted by any Servant of mine: Well Sir, <HI>&s;ays he, very &s;hort,</HI> then while I am your Servant, I won't &s;ay any-thing

Liberty, <HI>&s;aid I to my &s;elf,</HI> thou art a brave Article to &s;et Servants above their Ma&s;ters; if I had this Fellow in <HI>France</HI> now, or in <HI>Ger|many,</HI> or any where, but in <HI>England,</HI> I knew very well how to handle him; but here I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to my Servants.</P>
<P>All this I &s;ay, was only a Reflection in my own Thought; but I recover'd that Confu&s;ion his Saucine&s;s had put me into, and I an&s;wer'd him calmly, <HI>Well, William, you &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;s'd;</HI> &s;o I begun to ask him what Wages was due to him, which was not above two Months, and I paid him; and order'd another Servant to take an Account of &s;ome things that were in his Cu&s;tody, and let him go; but now <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> as you have di&s;mi&s;s'd your&s;elf from my Service, &s;o you mu&s;t let me di&s;mi&s;s you out of Doors too, for I will not have you in&s;ult the Gentleman in my Hou&s;e; I &s;aw this was &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s to him, but I would not &s;tir from him, till he had &s;tript my Livery off, put on his Frock, and went off.</P>
<P>As he went away, he began to Triumph, for he was now grown, not &s;aucy only, but im|pudent;
<PB N="30" REF="33">
and clapping his Right-Hand to his Left Shoulder two or three times; <HI>now I am my own Man again,</HI> &s;ays he, now I am at Liberty again Sir, and Liberty is the Birth|right of an <HI>Engli&s;hman; Well, William, &s;ays I to him,</HI> for I overheard him, but take Care how you make u&s;e of it, do not abu&s;e your Liberty; your being an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and hav|ing a right to the Liberty of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> does not make you Equal to a Gentleman; take Care how you behave, you know there's a Whiping-Po&s;t in the Pari&s;h, <HI>William;</HI> yes, yes, Sir, &s;ays he, I know it, and will take Care; I will indeed; and here he repeated it two or three times in a &s;coffing, &s;aucy Tone, <HI>I will take Care.</HI></P>
<P>I will, Sir, <HI>but I will &s;peak with <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &mdash; for all that, Sir.</HI></P>
<P>Look you <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> do not be ill-man|ner'd in my Hou&s;e; if you do, I will lay you by the Heels my&s;elf; I do &s;ay again, you &s;hall not &s;peak to him in my Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This made him be a little civiler, but yet it was not without &s;ome Difficulty, that I got him out of my Hou&s;e, and the Fellow was &s;o heated with the U&s;age he had, and &s;o Drunk with his Notion, of being now at <HI>Liberty,</HI> that he was as much out of his Sen&s;es, as if he had been Drunk indeed with Liquor.</P>
<P>However at la&s;t I got him out of my Hou&s;e, and &s;ent another Servant after him, to &s;ee whither he went; for I had a mind to &s;ee what he intended to do; it was not above half an Hour before my other Man came in,
<PB N="31" REF="34">
and told me that <HI>William</HI> went directly to Ju&s;tice &mdash;'s, and offered to depo&s;e that the Gentleman had Sworn 200 Oaths.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice endeavour'd with all his Might, to prevent his Swearing to it, in regard to the Gentleman that he &s;wore again&s;t, who was his Friend, and que&s;tion'd him &s;o many Ways, that he had almo&s;t puzzled the Fellow, and once or twice he was going away, to &s;ee for a|nother Ju&s;tice, telling that Ju&s;tice, that the Law gave him <HI>Liberty,</HI> and he was an <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> and wou'd have <HI>his Liberty;</HI> and as long as he was &s;ure he &s;wore nothing but the Truth, he would not be directed; that he came there to &s;wear to the Truth, and he would take the Hazard of what follow'd.</P>
<P>However, the Ju&s;tice, by good Words, and Per&s;wa&s;ions, brought him down to three&s;core, and he would come down no lower, but ap|peal'd to me, and de&s;ir'd the Ju&s;tice to ask me; &s;o the Ju&s;tice took his Oath, and di&s;mi&s;s'd him; after this, the Ju&s;tice &s;eeing another of my Servants there, <HI>as above,</HI> beckon'd to him to &s;tay; and when the Fellow was gone, he bade him de&s;ire of me, that I would call and &s;ee him in the Evening.</P>
<P>In the mean time the fir&s;t Gentleman &s;taid in my Hou&s;e, I had given him an Account of all that had happen'd; and much Difficulty I had to keep him from going out, to cha&s;ti&s;e this Fellow (as he call'd it) him&s;elf; however, I did prevail with him, for, indeed, as I knew the Fellow would be &s;awcy, and that the
<PB N="32" REF="35">
Gentleman was warm al&s;o, and pa&s;&s;ionate, I was afraid he &s;hould kill him; and I was wil|ling to prevent that kind of Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>But I was deliver'd from my Anxiety for a Time, by the following Accident: The Gen|tleman had two Servants that waited while their Ma&s;ter was with me, and they over|heard the Account my Servant had given me of what <HI>William</HI> had done, and they walk'd out into the Street, of their own Accord, (for I can bear their Ma&s;ter witne&s;s, he knew no|thing of it) and finding <HI>William</HI> loitering a|bout in the Street, one of them went up to him, and ask'd him what was the Matter, and what he did there? <HI>William</HI> an&s;wer'd, very &s;urlily, that he waited there to &s;peak with his Ma&s;ter, meaning <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &mdash;; my Ma&s;ter! <HI>&s;ays the Servant,</HI> What do you mean by that? don't you know where my Ma&s;ter, lives? can't you come to his Hou&s;e? what, do you pretend to way-lay him in the Street? If you have any-thing to &s;ay to my Ma&s;ter, come to Morrow Morning, and I'll engage my Ma&s;ter will let you &s;peak to him.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> now began to be more in the Wrong, than he had been in the Right before; for I could not &s;ay, but that at fir&s;t, <HI>William</HI> was in the Right.</P>
<P>But as the Servant talk'd thus far very calmly, and rationally to <HI>William,</HI> &s;o <HI>William</HI> talk'd hot, and high; told the Fellow, his Ma&s;ter had abus'd him (<HI>William</HI>) without a Cau&s;e, and that he was not a Servant now,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
but at Liberty, and he would not be abus'd by any Gentleman whatever; and he would &s;peak with him, <HI>ay, that he would.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, <HI>&s;ays the Servant,</HI> jeeringly; &s;o you are now my Ma&s;ter's Equal, are you? and you intend to demand Satisfaction of him, do you? Pray. where's your Sword, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>William?</HI> where's your Sword? <HI>Liberty</HI> has made you a Gentleman, I find that, and Gen|tlemen never go without a Sword.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. Servitor, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> if I am not your Ma&s;ter's Fellow, you are not my Fellow neither, till you have &s;tript off your Livery as I have done; your Ma&s;ter has a|bus'd me, and I took it from him, but I won't take it from you.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter abus'd you! Sirrah, my Ma&s;ter abu&s;es no-body, <HI>&s;ays the Servant.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> he has abus'd me, and he &s;hall know it too, as &s;oon as I can &s;ee him.</P>
<P>You <HI>Dog</HI> you, <HI>&s;ays the Servant,</HI> do you threaten <HI>my Ma&s;ter?</HI> What, do you wait here to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him? Prethee <HI>John, &s;ays he to his Fellow,</HI> go fetch a Con&s;table, I'll take Care of <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>William,</HI> &s;ince he won't &s;tay till to Morrow Morning to &s;peak with our Ma&s;ter; I'll &s;ecure him for to Night, and he &s;hall wait for him in the Cage.</P>
<P>Away goes <HI>John</HI> for a Con&s;table; but while he was gone, <HI>William</HI> grew very in&s;o|lent, and giving the Servant ill Language, and upon his Ma&s;ter too, they fell from one Word to another, and then to Blows; and tho' <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="37">
was a &s;tout Fellow of his Hands, yet the other Fellow was too hard for him, and <HI>William</HI> was upon the Point of yielding, when the Con&s;table came, and carried them both before the Ju&s;tice; the &s;ame before whom <HI>William</HI> had been &s;wearing.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was as high before the Ju&s;tice, as he was before with the Gentleman's Servant, and behav'd not only warm, but impudent; he was a <HI>Free-Man,</HI> he &s;aid, and not a <HI>Slave;</HI> and if a Gentleman had injur'd him, he wou'd be at Liberty to tell him &s;o.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice per&s;waded him, and told him, he ought to be quiet, till another time, as the Footman had per&s;waded him to be; that to &s;tay in the Street, and talk as he had done, was threatning the Gentleman, and that he ought to be &s;earch'd, if he had no Weapons about him.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> offer'd him&s;elf to be &s;earch'd, and indeed, he had no Weapons, nor did he intend to do any thing, but to be &s;aucy with his Tongue, which he might have paid dear enough for too, as I ob&s;erv'd; but the Ju&s;tice took Care of him for that Night, and the next Morning made him bring Sureties for the Peace, the Servant making Oath, that he gave both his Ma&s;ter and him too, threatning Lan|guage of his being reveng'd, and the like.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Story is &s;hort, <HI>viz. William,</HI> was humbled for the Liberty of his Tongue, but the Gentleman was forced to pay for his three&s;cure Oaths, and &s;o for that time <HI>William</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="38">
had no great Benefit of his being Free-born, or an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>William</HI> is not the only Example of the pro&s;tituting this glorious thing call'd <HI>Engli&s;h Liberty</HI> to the ba&s;e&s;t Purpo&s;e; I mu&s;t tell you another Story, which happen'd in the Compa&s;s of my own Family too.</P>
<P>I had a Steward, or as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call them, a Baily, who look'd after a &s;mall Concern which I have in the Country, and who I tru&s;ted with the whole Management of it, to &s;uch a Degree, that he had &s;everal Workmen and Servants employ'd by me, under him, and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was left to his Care and In&s;pection.</P>
<P>This Fellow I had a particular Confidence in, and a very good Opinion of, and' very un|willing I was to hear any Accu&s;ation again&s;t him; and the more, becau&s;e &s;everal things that had been alledg'd again&s;t him, when they came to be enquir'd into, and examin'd, were &s;ound either &s;o trivial as to be not worth Notice, or he &s;o effectually clear'd him&s;elf, that nothing cou'd be fa&s;ten'd upon him.</P>
<P>But one of my Servants, who I employ'd, in another Bu&s;ine&s;s, remote from that where this Steward was employ'd, came very &s;eriou&s;ly to me one Morning with a &s;ad Complaint, <HI>viz.</HI> that his Wife had been gone from him &s;ome time, and that, tho' he had with the utmo&s;t Application &s;earch'd her wicked Haunts, and had for &s;ome Years &s;u&s;pected it, and been a&s;&s;ur'd of it from others, that &s;he kept Com|pany
<PB N="36" REF="39">
with my &s;aid Steward, yet he cou'd never come at a Certainty of it till now; that now he was fully per&s;waded it was &s;o, and hop'd I would do him &s;o much Ju&s;tice as to put a Check to it.</P>
<P>I &s;mil'd at the weakne&s;s of his la&s;t Reque&s;t, tho' I pity'd the poor Man in the former part of his Di&s;a&s;ter; for &s;ays I, you know 'tis out of my Power: If my Man will be wicked I have no Power to re&s;train him; as if your Wife will be a Whore, you &s;ee you cannot re&s;train her; Liberty <HI>you know,</HI> in <HI>England, &s;ays I,</HI> is too often claim'd for a Freedom to do wickedly, and what can I do for you?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;ays I, but what Proof is there of the Fact? for what can I pretend to talk to him about, when upon his denying the Fact, <HI>as to be &s;ure he will,</HI> I &s;hou'd produce no Evi|dence; my Mouth <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> will be &s;topt; he own'd he had no po&s;itive Proof to produce, but he gave me &s;uch particular Di&s;coveries, that I was convinc'd it was really &s;o, as well as he; &s;o I told him I would talk with the Stewart about it.</P>
<P>Accordingly one Morning I took the Liber|ty, after other Di&s;cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s was over, to tell my Steward, what Rumour was rais'd upon his Conver&s;ation with &s;uch a Man's Wife, and that (they &s;aid,) he was &s;o open, and barefac'd in it, that he kept her at &s;uch a Place, and &s;o told him other Circum&s;tances, which began to put him hard to it; however he deny'd it very &s;tifly; look ye, &s;aid I, if
<PB N="37" REF="40">
it is &s;o, I am very &s;orry for it, and I expect you will con&s;ider of it: He an&s;wer'd, after again denying it, that he had always taken Care of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and hop'd I would be &s;atisfied with that, and that I would not enter into other Matters, and li&s;ten to the fal&s;e Ac|cu&s;ations of his Enemies, who were his Ene|mies chiefly, becau&s;e he took Care that they &s;hou'd not abu&s;e and impo&s;e upon me; and &s;o in a Word, did as good as &s;ay, that if he minded my Bu&s;ine&s;s, I had no Right to meddle with him any further.</P>
<P>I took him a little &s;hort there, and told him, that it was true, that I had no Power to examine him, or to puni&s;h him, if he was guilty; but that if the thing was true, it was really an In&s;ult upon me, and my Family, the Woman's Husband, as he knew, being a Relation to me, at &s;ome di&s;tance, tho' he was my Servant too, and that as he was al&s;o in|tru&s;ted and employ'd by me, he might depend I &s;hou'd think it hard, that one who receiv'd &s;o many Benefits from me, &s;hould have &s;o little Re&s;pect for me, as to debauch a Woman who was Marry'd to one of my Relations, and &s;hould do it, as it were, under my No&s;e.</P>
<P>He reply'd, tho' with Re&s;pect, that he hop'd I would not think my&s;elf concern'd in the Clamour; that as he did not own he was guilty of any &s;uch thing, and no-body cou'd prove it, he de&s;ir'd I would not believe any thing of it, till it was prov'd.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41">
I told him, as to Proof in Law, it was none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, but that I doubted there was Proof enough to make it rea&s;onable to believe it, and that it was not &s;ufferable; he told me in &s;o many Words, that he thought it was hard to be examin'd &s;o clo&s;e about it; that he took Care to mind my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and cou'd not be charg'd with omitting it; as to other things, he was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and de&s;ir'd to have his <HI>LIBERTY,</HI> and &s;o my Man and I parted.</P>
<P>This is the U&s;e, or rather the&s;e are &s;ome of the U&s;es, they make of Liberty in this Part of the World; I'll trouble you with but one Example more, and di&s;mi&s;s this Part; in the late Queen's Reign, when the Earl of <HI>Gallaway</HI> commanded the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ent thither as Auxilliaries to King <HI>Charles,</HI> now Emperor, the Army begining to grow &s;ickly, it was &s;aid the Soldiers got the Flux by eating Grapes, and other green Fruit.</P>
<P>Upon this, the General publi&s;h'd an Order, that the Soldiers &s;hould not eat any Grapes for a certain time, upon Pain of Death; and none of the Suttlers, or Pea&s;ants, were allowed to bring any Grapes into the Camp, upon the like Penalties.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are not fam'd for be|ing the mo&s;t ea&s;ie to be re&s;train'd in &s;uch Ca&s;es, &s;o &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers had got out of the Camp, and not being able to refrain the tempting Fruit, had gorg'd them|&s;elves with Grapes, and three of them fell
<PB N="39" REF="42">
Sick of the Flux; upon which the General &s;ent to have them brought before him; but when the Officers came to fetch them, truly, they were &s;o near being dead, tho' not dead, that they were not in a Condition to be &s;tirr'd, and I think two of them died that Night; however one of them being told, the General had &s;ent for them, and being ask'd, if he had eaten any Grapes, he boldly an&s;wer'd yes; at which the Officer asking how they dur&s;t pre|&s;ume to break the General's Orders, adding, that if he recover'd, he would certainly be hang'd, the Fellow an&s;wer'd, as for hanging, there was no need to hang them, they were dead Men already; and as to the General's Orders, they had obey'd him in every thing, relating to their Bu&s;ine&s;s as Soldiers; but as to the re&s;t, they were <HI>ENGLISH-MEN,</HI> and thought they ought to have their <HI>LIBERTY,</HI> and that they had a Right to kill them&s;elves whenever they pleas'd</P>
<P>It &s;eems they all died, and &s;o prevented Ju|&s;tice; for the Excu&s;e was of no Weight, be|cau&s;e the Prince has a Right to the Service of his Subjects, and no Man can kill him&s;elf, without a Crime again&s;t his Sovereign, as well as again&s;t Heaven: But 'tis appo&s;ite to my Purpo&s;e, namely, the Notion we have of <HI>Li|berty</HI> here, and the Abu&s;e of that <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Be pleas'd to ob&s;erve now, that when I &s;peak of <HI>Liberty</HI> being abus'd in <HI>England,</HI> I keep my Eye principally upon the Morals of the Nation, upon the Abu&s;e of the Laws, made
<PB N="40" REF="43">
for the Pre&s;ervation of good Manners among Men, and the Encouragement given by the Neg|ligence of tho&s;e who ought to puni&s;h the Breakers of tho&s;e Laws.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Sorts of Liberty, which are gro&s;sly abus'd here, as well as this; <HI>for Example,</HI> Fir&s;t, <HI>Religious Liberty;</HI> it is true, I that abhor Per&s;ecution for Religion, do not complain of this, as if there ought not to be a <HI>Liberty</HI> granted to con&s;cientious Chri&s;tians to wor&s;hip God in the Manner which they be|lieve to mo&s;t agreeable to his Will, and mo&s;t edifying to them&s;elves; but I cannot but think that <HI>Liberty</HI> gro&s;sly abus'd, when 'tis made u&s;e of to protect tho&s;e who deny all Reveal'd Re|ligion; who, in&s;tead of a <HI>Liberty</HI> in Religion, claim a <HI>Liberty</HI> to be of no Religion at-all.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, the Toleration of Di&s;&s;enters, which is what they found their Religious <HI>Li|berties</HI> upon, is commonly call'd, an Act for <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience;</HI> in my Opinion, that very Title explains the Meaning of the Law, that it is to give <HI>Liberty</HI> to Tender Con&s;ciences <HI>to wor&s;hip God.</HI> &amp;c. as I &s;ay above: This can|not import a Liberty to harden'd Con&s;ciences, to wor&s;hip <HI>no God at all,</HI> and to &s;ear neither <HI>GOD</HI> or <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>There are great Di&s;putes about Religion in this Nation, as well as in other Places, per|haps more here than any-where el&s;e; but the Di&s;pute I take Notice of, is not between this and that Religion, or this and that Sect or O|pinion in Religion, but betwixt <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>De|vil;</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="44">
a Man &s;hall come into my Company, and bla&s;pheme God, deny his Redeemer, and make a Mock of all Religion, and then tell me, he is an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and claims <HI>Liberty;</HI> that there is a Law to give Liberty of Con&s;cience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this is un&s;ufferable, and Liberty of Con&s;cience has nothing to do in the Ca&s;e; the Man both by the Laws of God, and of all Chri&s;tian Nations, ought to be puni&s;hed; there's, nothing of Re|ligion or Con&s;cience in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a Parallel Ca&s;e in this very &s;ame Con&s;titution, and Government; we have a per|ticular Liberty here, and what we value our|&s;elves very much upon, and this is call'd, <HI>the Liberty of the PRESS,</HI> that is to &s;ay, that every Man is at Liberty to Print and Publi&s;h what he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Pre&s;s, the Government frequently take up both <HI>Authors</HI> and <HI>Printers,</HI> if they Printany thing of|fen&s;ive, or again&s;t the <HI>Admini&s;tration;</HI> or if they publi&s;h any Per&s;onal Reflections, the Per&s;on in|jur'd if the&s;e Reflections are unju&s;t and &s;lande|rous, has a Right to pro&s;ecute the Publi&s;her and Author, and will have his Remedy at Law.</P>
<P>Again, the Government claim to re&s;ent inju|rious Reproaches, Sarca&s;ms, and Satyrs, upon any foreign Prince or State in alliance with <HI>England,</HI> and may oblige the Authors and Publi&s;hers to an&s;wer for all &s;uch Indecencies; <HI>for Example,</HI> one Author, and a <HI>Frenchman</HI> too, who wrote a Publick Paper, was taken up here for printing that the <HI>Duke of Luxemberg</HI> was
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Hump-&s;houlder'd, and yet you and I, that have &s;een him &s;o often at the Head of the <HI>French</HI> Armies, know very well how eminent a Truth it was.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN my fir&s;t Letter I gave you &s;ome of my Ob&s;ervations upon the wretch|ed Notions which the People here, have entertained of that glorious thing call'd <HI>Liberty:</HI> and how that <HI>Liberty,</HI> which is the be&s;t of Mankind's Pri|vileges, is abu&s;ed in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Sence, and applied to the meane&s;t and mo&s;t &s;coundrel Purpo&s;es; I &s;hall now bring it all down to the De&s;ign I am upon, and let you &s;ee how the&s;e fal&s;e Notions of <HI>Liberty,</HI> getting into the Heads of the common People, have Intoxica|ted their Brains, and have, in a word, de&s;troy'd all Subordination among us, and joining with the Inva&s;ion of our Morals, of which I am next to &s;peak, has &s;et the World, (as I &s;aid) with the Bottom upwar'd, and have rais'd &s;uch a Devil among our Servants, as will not ea&s;ily be laid.</P>
<P>I am therefore now to lay before you &s;ome|thing of what I call the great Innundation of Vice, that has thus tainted the Nation's Morals, and which in particular, has de|bauch'd the common People.</P>
<P>In order to this, I de&s;ire you will take this whole Letter as a Parenthe&s;is, or Degre&s;ion, as it breaks in upon what went before; and after
<PB N="44" REF="47">
which, I &s;hall go on in my next where I left off in my la&s;t; &s;o that you may at any Time connect or join the Ob&s;ervations, without this Part, which is rather a Hi&s;tory, but which you will find &s;o nece&s;iary to the Under|&s;tanding of the whole, that I believe you will not think it any Interruption in your Reading.</P>
<P>At my very fir&s;t coming into <HI>England,</HI> having not yet engag'd in &s;ettled Bu&s;ine&s;s, I lik'd both the Place and the People &s;o well, that I re&s;olv'd to make my &s;tated Re&s;idence here for my Life; in order to this, I began to look upon the Place as my Native Country, and immediately applied to my Friends to get my&s;elf Naturaliz'd, that I might &s;ettle my Fortunes here, as Providence &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e al&s;o, I re&s;olv'd for one of my fir&s;t Steps, <HI>as I would advi&s;e all Gentlemen to do, whether Natives or Forreigners,</HI> to make my&s;elf thorowly accquainted with the whole Hi&s;tory of the Country, and then with its Antiquities, &s;o that I &s;hould be Ma&s;ter both of its <HI>antient State,</HI> its <HI>pre&s;ent State,</HI> and al&s;o its Government, and Laws, and of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the People; the delightful Study of this took me up &s;omething above a Year, in which time I read over, and that very carefully, all the be&s;t Hi&s;tories of the I&s;land, in which are recorded the general In|troduction of Laws, Rights, Soveraignty, and civil Goverment in the Nation; and account of the fir&s;t Inhabitants, and with what Gallantry
<PB N="45" REF="48">
and Bravery they defended their <HI>Liberty</HI> again&s;t the &s;everal Inva&s;ions of the <HI>Romans, Picts, Saxons, Danes, Normans,</HI> and the Wars and Bloody Battles which afterward happen'd between tho&s;e contending Nations, for the maintaining the Conque&s;ts they had made, and keeping the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which they had mark'd out to them&s;elves in this I&s;land.</P>
<P>In reading the&s;e Hi&s;tories, I came to under|&s;tand how the People of this Nation came to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch unu&s;ual <HI>Privileges</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> &s;uch as no Nation enjoy but them|&s;elves, and what original Plea of Right they have to make for them; a Plea which appears &s;o ju&s;t, and excepting &s;ome Intervals, when their Monarchs, unea&s;ie to be under the Re|&s;traint of Laws, and be, as it were, govern'd by their People, have made Attempts to get out of tho&s;e Fetters, and free the <HI>Crown,</HI> as they call'd it, from popular Bondage, <HI>in which Attempts too, they have always mi&s;carry'd;</HI> I &s;ay, excepting which, their Plea of Right has been always &s;o demon&s;trably ju&s;t, that their be&s;t Kings have willingly yielded to them, and thought it a &s;ufficient Glory to their Family, to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Monarchy &s;o flouri&s;hing, <HI>even with all its Limitations.</HI></P>
<P>But as I ob&s;erv'd, there have been In|tervals of this Peace, and &s;ome of their Prin|ces, as above, impatient of Re&s;traint, have broken the <HI>Circle of Government,</HI> attempted to make them&s;elves arbitrary, a&s;&s;um'd a de&s;potick Right, and trampling on the Laws and Con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="46" REF="49">
of the Kingdom, have broken out into Oppre&s;&s;ions and Ravages on the Properties of their Subjects, in manife&s;t Violation of the Laws, which even tho&s;e very Princes had &s;worn to rule by; but then, on the contrary, it &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that the&s;e Violati|ons of Right, <HI>as I call them,</HI> never fail'd to meet with Oppo&s;ition from the Subjects; the People, on all tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, <HI>being a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by the Nobility and Gentry,</HI> frequently had recour&s;e to Arms, to vindicate their ju&s;t Rights, and free them&s;elves from Tyranny and Op|pre&s;&s;ion; and 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd, with &s;ome Wonder, almo&s;t upon all the&s;e Occa&s;ions the Kings had the wor&s;t; as their Claims were unju&s;t, their Attempts were un&s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;ome of them were compell'd to undo what they had done, and re&s;tore the People to their Liberty; as King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and King <HI>Hen.</HI> III. K. <HI>John;</HI> K. <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. and others; and la&s;t of all, K. <HI>James</HI> II. Others were entirely ruin'd, de|pos'd, and lo&s;t both Power and Life; as King <HI>Edw.</HI> II. <HI>Richard</HI> II. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> of <HI>Eng|gli&s;hmen,</HI> of which &s;o much has been &s;aid in the World, and of which &s;uch &s;trange Con|&s;tructions, and &s;uch &s;imple U&s;e is made in the&s;e Days, of which I &s;hall &s;ay more as I go on; and for this Rea&s;on it is, I take this Notice of it here.</P>
<P>As thus I made my&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Hi|&s;tory, and <HI>ancient State</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> I re&s;olv'd in the next Place, to make my&s;elf Ma&s;ter of
<PB N="47" REF="50">
its <HI>pre&s;ent State</HI> al&s;o; and to this Purpo&s;e, I travell'd in three or four &s;everal Tours, over the whole I&s;land, critically ob&s;erving, and carefully informing my&s;elf of every thing worth ob&s;erving in all the Towns and Coun|tries through which I pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P>I took with me an <HI>ancient Gentleman</HI> of my Acquaintance, who I found was thorowly ac|quainted with almo&s;t every Part of <HI>England,</HI> and who was to me as a walking Library, or a moveable Map of the Countries and Towns through which we pa&s;s'd; and we never fail'd to enquire of the mo&s;t proper Per&s;ons in every Place where we came, what was to be &s;een? what Rarities of Nature, Antiquities, ancient Buildings were in the re&s;pective Parts? or, in &s;hort, every thing worth the Ob&s;ervation of Travellers.</P>
<P>I have often complain'd, that tho' the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians, e&s;pecially in their relating Facts, have been very particular and di&s;tinct; and the Hi&s;tories of the &s;everal Wars in <HI>England</HI> are very well written, yet that they are all very indifferent in their <HI>Geography,</HI> and that the Reader is &s;poken to, as &s;uppo&s;ing he knew be|fore where every-thing &s;poken of, was done, and how every Town or Country mention'd, was &s;ituated; whereas I, that was a perfect Stranger to the&s;e things, &s;hould have been greatly at a Lo&s;s: But to remedy this, I had always the Maps of every Country before me, at the &s;ame time that I read the Hi&s;tory; as al&s;o, I had a Book, entitled <HI>Britannia,</HI> writ|ten
<PB N="48" REF="51">
by that very learned Antiquary, Mr. <HI>Cam|den,</HI> and &s;ome other Books too, which treat of the natural Hi&s;tory, as well as the Antiqui|ties of every County; with the&s;e Helps in my travelling, together with my learned Companion, I was generally inform'd of every thing material, wherever I came; whereas, without the&s;e I might have gone thro' many, Places where valuable Antiquities, and other Curio&s;ities of Nature or Art were to be &s;een, and have known nothing of them; and he that travels <HI>England</HI> without &s;uch Helps, may in many Ca&s;es, almo&s;t as well, &s;tay at Home.</P>
<P>But to come to that which is more particular to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, and which is the Rea|&s;on of giving you this Account of my Tra|vels; by this Means I became particularly ac|quainted with the common People, as well as with the Country, in every Place where I came; I ob&s;erv'd their Language, that is, the &s;everal Dialects of it, for they &s;trangely di&s;|fer in their Way of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, tho' in the &s;ame Tongue; and there is as much difference between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, as &s;poken in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and the &s;ame Torgue, as &s;poken in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> as be|tween the French &s;poken in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and that of <HI>Ga&s;cogne,</HI> and <HI>Poictou</HI> I; &s;ay, I became accquainted with their Language, Cu&s;toms, Manners, Tempers, and above all with their Morals, which is the thing I &s;hall have mo&s;t Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of in the&s;e Letters: I &s;hall trouble you now with no more, relating to
<PB N="49" REF="52">
my Travels, I may in time &s;atisfie the other Part of your late Reque&s;t, and give you a full account of the Country, which indeed, is well worth a Traveller's Pains to &s;ee, and a Reader's trouble to look over; but I have not now time to revi&s;e my Journals, and the Minutes which I took of things every where as I pa&s;s'd, which are very critical I a&s;&s;ure you, and fruitful, of a very diverting as well as in&s;tructing varie|ty; that Part I mu&s;t refer to another Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>My Friend who went with me, was very curious al&s;o, and the more becau&s;e I reque&s;ted it of him, in making Enquiries into, and Ob&s;ervations upon the Cu&s;toms and Man|ners of the People, which, <HI>as I mention'd above,</HI> are the principal things which I am now &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve &s;everal of the Authors I have ju&s;t now mentioned, have written largely of the antient Families of the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> their Originals, Names, Arms, and &s;ometimes the Hi&s;tory of particular Men among them, who have made them&s;elves famous in the World, of which the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> have produc'd many.</P>
<P>But I meet with very few that take Notice of the common People; how they live, what their general Employment is, and what the particular Employment of them is in the &s;everal Counties re&s;pectively, and yet I found this an Enquiry very full of u&s;eful Ob&s;ervati|ons, and attended with innumerable Incidents,
<PB N="50" REF="53">
which gave Light into things of the greate&s;t Moment, as well in Hi&s;tory as Antiquity; and which &s;eem'd to add a Part in the Knowledge of the Country, which a Traveller cou'd not be without.</P>
<P>To come to the Point, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve to you, as the Ground-Work of my whole De&s;ign, that the common People of this Country have &s;uffer'd a kind of general Revolution, or change in their Di&s;po&s;ition, Temper and Man|ners, within a certain Term of Years, (<HI>which I &s;hall mark out to you in its Place al&s;o,</HI>) I &s;ay they have &s;uffer'd a general change, &s;uch as I believe no Nation has undergone but them&s;elves; I wi&s;h I cou'd &s;ay it was a change for the better; but be that as it will, I &s;hall endeavour to give you an impartial Account of it as it is.</P>
<P>It is in the next Place needful to ob&s;erve to you, that I took this Journey at the unhappy Time when this Change, or Revolution in the Manners and Temper of the common People was in the height of its Operation, namely, in the Years 1684, to 1688; for I was near four Year before I fini&s;h'd my Travels.</P>
<P>I that was then a Stranger to the People, tho' not altogether to the Place, was not fully accquainted with their ju&s;t Character in Times pa&s;t; but my Companion, upon who&s;e Judge|ment I very much depended, and who being an ob&s;erving as well as an antient Man, had been conver&s;ant among them for three&s;core Years before; &s;upply'd me in that Part, in a
<PB N="51" REF="54">
Manner, which no Books or Maps cou'd do, for this Part is, as I have &s;aid, &s;carce meddl'd, with in Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>I li&s;ten'd very carefully to his Di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e this was the Part that I more par|ticularly intended to inquire into; and often de&s;ir'd him to tell me what that kind of

People they were in his Time; for what they were then, and how they behav'd then, we both knew very well.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'He told me that about the Year 1634 to 38, when he began to be conver&s;ant in the World on his own Account, the common People were plain, fair-dealing, &s;ober, open|hearted, courteous. humble; that generally &s;peaking, they were very hone&s;t in their dea|ling, and in many Places religious and con&s;ci|entious in their Conver&s;ation; that the Ser|vants were mode&s;t, humble, mannerly, and very &s;ub&s;ervient to tho&s;e who entertain'd and employ'd them; that the <HI>Apprentices</HI> either to Trade&s;men or Handicrafts, were quiet, dilligent, &s;ubmitted chearfully to Family-Bu&s;ine&s;s, Orders, and Hours; were labori|ous, and work'd hard for their Ma&s;ters Benefit, having their Eyes at the Time, when by the expiration of their Terms, they &s;hould have the Benefit of their In|du&s;try, and of the Labour of other Ser|vants for them&s;elves; nay, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> even in <HI>London,</HI> the Servants and Apprentices to Shop-Keepers, Warehou&s;e-Keepers, and to the be&s;t Merchants, thought it not below them to &s;toop to the meane&s;t needful things in their Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;uch as a&s;&s;i&s;ting Package of Goods; clearing, &s;etting to Rights, and Sweeping their Warehou&s;es, Counting-Hou&s;es, and Shops; loading Carts, opening and &s;hutting Doors and Windows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which hereafter.</P><P><PB N="53" REF="56">
'The Wages of the Poor, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> were not more then, tho' their Labour was greater, but ju&s;t the contrary; the Wages of hir'd Ser|vants were then from 30<HI>s.</HI> per <HI>Annum,</HI> to 50<HI>s.</HI> for a Maid-Servant; 6<HI>d.</HI> to 8<HI>d,</HI> and 10<HI>d.</HI> a Day to a Labouring or Husband-Man; farther in the <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Country, not &s;o much; the Farmers hir'd their yearly Men-Servants, who they took into the Hou&s;e for 40<HI>s,</HI> and their Diet; the Gentlemen. had their Serving-Men or Footmen, to whom they al&s;o gave their Diet for 30<HI>s</HI> to 40<HI>s.</HI> a Year; and as to Nobleman, and Per&s;ons of Quality, they had their Footmen, <HI>as we now call them,</HI> of the Sons of their Tennants, who thought it their Honour to be taken into the Service and Family of the Lord of the Mannour; and had a Badge of that Honour, <HI>viz.</HI> a Livery given them of Ru&s;&s;et-Cloth with a Badge, or Mark of his Lord&s;hip's Arms; and at <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s</HI> a Ro&s;e-Noble in Silver, to ble&s;s their Pockets; nor was there any need for &s;uch as tho&s;e to have more Wages, for their Lord generally prefer'd them after certain Terms of Service, to be Tennants of &s;mall Farms, or made them Cottages, and put them into a Way to get their Bread by Hone&s;t Labour, and dil|ligence in Husbandry, which was the ut|mo&s;t of their Ambition.</P></Q></P>
<P>I look'd earne&s;tly at him, while he talk'd thus, and after he had done, pray then, &s;aid I, when, and from what Cau&s;es and Beginings,
<PB N="54" REF="57">
came that &s;trange Alteration of things which we &s;ee now? for the Country People, as well as the Trades-People in Towns and Cities, are quite another &s;ort of Folks at this time, than what you &s;peak of? and as for the Ser|vants, they move in another kind of Circle, and do not under&s;tand the Language you talk of.</P>
<P>O, &s;ays he, 'tis a di&s;mal and melancholly thing to tell you, how this Alteration has happen'd; and you that are a Stranger, will neither have Patience to hear it, or be able to give Credit to it, when you do.</P>

<P>'But that which follow'd, &s;aid he, was &s;till wor&s;e, and fini&s;h'd the Ruin of the Morals of our People, e&s;pecially of the Gentry throughout the Nation, and more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who took Part with the King in the Troubles which follow'd; for the King, &s;aid he, being oblig'd by the Fate of the Day to rai&s;e an Army again&s;t his tumultuous Subjects; and that Army being compos'd <HI>not of li&s;ted Troops, as now,</HI> in which Ca&s;e the Law of <HI>Subordination</HI> being rigorou&s;ly and &s;olemnly ob&s;erv'd, the Officers are as &s;ub|ject one to another, as the meane&s;t Soldiers; but the King's Army being rais'd by the generous Contribution of the Loyal Gentry, the Officers were all Gentlemen and Volen|tiers,

<PB N="58" REF="61">
about her Kitchin-Affairs, goes to the Gate, and asks who was there? they bid G&mdash;d D&mdash;n her, why did &s;he not open the Gate? one cry'd, &s;hoot her; and another Damn her cut her Throat, and the like; but the Wench finding they were Soldiers, pray'd them to be quiet, &s;he would go up to her Ma&s;ter for the Key's, and let them in pre&s;ently; &s;o &s;he runs up to the Ma&s;ter's Chamber-Door, and calls to him; the Man ju&s;t fallen into his fir&s;t Sleep, did not wake pre&s;ently, and the Wench was almo&s;t as im|patient at the Chamber-Door, as the Troopers were without, who began to knock and lay on at the Gate again; at la&s;t, the Man waking, and hearing what was the matter, &s;tarts out of Bed, and began to put on his Cloaths; Soldiers! &s;ays he, Troopers! who are they for? for! &s;ays the Wench, you need not ask who they are for; <HI>they are for the King</HI> to be &s;ure, <HI>hark how they &s;wear.</HI></P>
<P>'Here my Friend &s;topp'd, as if he had done; well but Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> what is this to the &s;trange Turn given to the Poor com|mon People, and labouring Poor, the Ser|vants, and the like, who, you &s;ay, were &s;o plain, &s;o open-hearted, &s;o quiet, &s;o mode&s;t, and &s;o low-priz'd &s;ince you can remember; whence came the Change upon them?</P>
<P>'Well, &s;ays he, I am coming to that, I &s;hall Account for it, as plainly as for the other; after the War was over, and the Royal-Family,
<PB N="59" REF="62">
was re&s;tor'd, Things took a new Turn again; the out-&s;ide of Religion, which the Parliament's People had maintain'd, <HI>be it, that it was from right or wrong Principles,</HI> had had this good Effect, namely, that it kept the World &s;ober; but upon the return of Monarchy at the Re&s;toration, the Court was all Mirth and Gayety again, and the whole Nation rejoic'd with them; <HI>their Joy was, without que&s;tion, ju&s;t, no body di&s;puted that Part;</HI> but unhappy for <HI>England,</HI> they cou'd find no way to Expre&s;s an exceeding Joy, but by an exce&s;s of Crime; and par|ticularly, that mo&s;t bruti&s;h of all Crimes, Drunkenne&s;s, which over&s;pread the Nation like a Winter-Flood, and a torrent of Oaths, and Prophanene&s;s follow'd of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>'He then de&s;cended to Particulars; the Families of the Nobility and Gentry, &s;aid he, were all univer&s;ally touch'd with the&s;e wicked doings; in particular, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> Drinking <HI>Healths began here;</HI> a thing, till then not known in <HI>England;</HI> the King's Health, the Health of all the Royal-Family one after another, &s;ix Gla&s;ies in a Hand; he that had the Victory at the Gla&s;s, was the be&s;t Subject; Drunkenne&s;s grew a Te&s;t of Loyalty; and nothing that was &s;ober, cou'd keep Company, without being affron|ted.</P>
<P>'And yet had this been all, one cou'd hardly expect le&s;s from a Nation over|whelm'd with Joy, at the return of the
<PB N="60" REF="63">
Royal-Family, and the re&s;toring the For|tunes and Circum&s;tances of &s;o many ruin'd Families, and exil'd Cavaliers; but not content with this, the Cu&s;tom of impo&s;ing Healths upon every-body that came into Company, follow'd it; &s;o that no-body cou'd vi&s;it his Friend without being made Drunk.</P>
<P>'Nor was it enough to drink the King's Health, with the Healths of all the Royal-Family, and of General <HI>Monk,</HI> and of the Royal-Oak, and every &s;imple mad thing they cou'd think of; but then, in &s;pight of the Act of Oblivion, and the King's exhor|ting the People in his Speeches to Parlia|ment to forget all former things, Words of Di&s;tinction, and Marks, and Names of Re|proach, they mu&s;t then drink Confu&s;ion to the Rump, Damnation to <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> and all his Race, Confu&s;ion to the Phana|ticks, and a thou&s;and &s;uch extravagant things; all which had this additional Evil in the Practice, namely, that they &s;erv'd to pour Wine down the Throats of the whole Company, and make Drunkenne&s;s over&s;pread Society in general.</P>
<P>'Neither was this only practis'd at the beginning of the Re&s;toration, but it held on, even to the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> at the latter-end of who&s;e Reign, as if it had &s;lack'd before, and that they were afraid the Nation &s;hould grow Sober again, the Tide of Drunkenne&s;s, which had but &s;eem'd
<PB N="61" REF="64">
to Ebb a little, came on again with a &s;ur|prizing reflux; e&s;pecially upon the Divi&s;ions at the latter-end of the Popi&s;h Plot, between <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> and particularly upon the Subject of the Bill of Exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Till then, Drunkenne&s;s had not &s;o uni|ver&s;ally &s;pread it&s;elf among the common People; the Gentlemen contented them&s;elves with being Drunk, and making one another &s;o, but upon that Occa&s;ion, it became a Politick Intere&s;t to make Servants, Tennants, Trade&s;|men, and every-body, Poor, as well as Rich drink to Exce&s;s; drinking the Duke of <HI>York's;</HI> Health became a new Te&s;t of Society, and of Loyalty; drinking to the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Right-Line; Confu&s;ion to the Presbyterians; to all tho&s;e that were for the Bill of Exclu&s;ion; and the like.</P>
<P>'Now came on frequent Di&s;&s;olutions, and Elections of Parliament, and in con&s;equence of that, the Bribery and Corruption, the Treating for Elections, and all tho&s;e Treatings attended with Exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, increa&s;ed to &s;uch a Degree, that in a few Years the Habit of Drunkenne&s;s, and the Drinking of Healths, <HI>as above,</HI> &s;pread by the Example of the Gentlemen to the Tennants, to the common People in the Corporations, to the Servants, and in &s;hort, to the whole Body of the People.</P>
<P>'And tho' it was true, that there remain'd a great many &s;ober, good, religious People in the Nation, <HI>and 'tis to be hop'd there does</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="65">
<HI>&s;o &s;till,</HI> yet here began the Ruin of the Na|tion's Morals; here the Poor got a &s;match of Drunkenne&s;s, and withal a dreadful Habit of &s;wearing, raging, and damning one another in their Drink as well as the Rich; and with them it continues and encrea&s;es every Day.</P>
<P>'An In&s;tance of this, <HI>adds my Relater,</HI> is evident in the Number of Ale-Hou&s;es and Publick-Hou&s;es erected in the fir&s;t five Years after the Re&s;toration, of which &s;ays he, this is the &s;hort Detail. <TABLE>

<P>Here my Friend clos'd his Hi&s;torical Account, as he call'd it, of the growth of Debauchery in <HI>England,</HI> and the Revolution which the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> &s;uffer'd in tho&s;e Days; he only added the&s;e Words at the end of it; I will not, &s;ays he, an&s;wer for the Exactne&s;s of the Ac|count above; as to the Encrea&s;e of Victual|ling-Hou&s;es,
<PB N="63" REF="66">
May-Poles, and Brewing, tho' I have great Rea&s;on to believe they are rather within Compa&s;s than beyond it; but this I think is certain, that by tho&s;e means the Morals of the Nation were ruin'd: Let me only add a few of my Remarks to this Di&s;|cour&s;e; Experience &s;hews that it appears much ea&s;ier to conquer and give a Check to this Vice thus broken in among the Gentlemen, than it is to check it among the common People.</P>
<P>At the late <HI>Revolution,</HI> upon the coming of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that &s;candalous Cu&s;tom of impo&s;ing upon People, and obliging People to drink whether they would or no, receiv'd a Check; with their lo&s;t Liberties, the Nation recover'd the Liberty of Drinking, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> of Drinking as they pleas'd; and on a &s;udden, from a Mode or Fa&s;hion of putting the Cup to your Neighbour's No&s;e, it became the Mode to give every Man leave to Drink as he pleas'd, according to the old Rule at <HI>Aha&s;uerus's Fea&s;t;</HI> and this was a great Point gain'd too.</P>
<P>But alas! it was too late; the Di&s;temper was too far gone; if the Gentlemen would not make the Servants Drunk, the Servants would make one another &s;o; the Tennants now began to drink as fa&s;t as the Landlords; the Husbandman as fa&s;t as the Employer, and as every Man in Drinking among the Gentry, had the Liberty to Drink as little as he would,
<PB N="64" REF="67">
&s;o every Man among the common People claim'd the Liberty of Drinking, as much as he would; at the &s;ame time knowing not how to &s;et Bounds to their Drinking-Gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Wonder not that I call the <HI>Drunken Vice</HI> the wor&s;t of all <HI>Brutallity;</HI> it appears by its Con&s;equences in this Nation, to be the <HI>Mother Sin,</HI> the Parent or producing Cau&s;e of all Vice; the Sins of Whoreing, Gameing, Thieving, Murther, Rapin, Couzening, and Cheating, and particularly that of Swearing, have been its natural Progeny, and have all enter'd at this one Door; Drunkenne&s;s has been the great Ance&s;tor of them all.</P>
<P>That <HI>Swearing, Whoreing,</HI> and <HI>Murther,</HI> are the natural Con&s;equences of Drunkenne&s;s you will grant me, I believe, at fir&s;t Word; neither is there any need to debate the Point here, Experience proves it; but &s;uffer me, I be&s;eech you, to look a little into it.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Cu&s;tom of Prophane <HI>Swearing</HI> is &s;o encreas'd among the poor People, <HI>Ser|vants, Labourers, &amp;c.</HI> that it is trouble|&s;ome to &s;ober People to go along the Street; they hear the Mouths of the common Labouring Poor &s;o continually over-flowing with gall: I remember, being in the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts of <HI>England,</HI> beyond <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> I met an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, who was ju&s;t that very Day come out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and it was &s;o greivous to him, that he cou'd
<PB N="65" REF="68">
not forbear complaning of it to me; his Expre&s;&s;ion was this, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'If I was, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to be brought out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> blindfold, I would tell at the fir&s;t Town I &s;et my Foot in, on this &s;ide the Border, that I was on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground, by hearing the Name of God prophaned by the very Young Children in the Street; the grown People &s;wear|ing and cur&s;ing in all their ordinary Di&s;cour&s;e; whereas for the Honour of <HI>Scotland, &s;ays he,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;peak it, you hear nothing, or but very little of it there.</Q></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Every-body knows, that this horrid Cu&s;tom is the ordinary Companion of Drunkenne&s;s: Swearing and Cur&s;ing are the Brats of the Bot|tle, that way, and that way only they came in; and tho' the Gentlemen have a little abated the dreadful Exce&s;s; as if, their Footmen and Servants having learnt to out-&s;wear them, it was become a little too Vulgar for them; yet, this I may venture to &s;ay now, that the Footmen and Servants will not &s;o ea&s;ily follow their Ma&s;ter's Example in abating it, as they did follow their Example in learning it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, (as if the Devil having got hold of the Nation in this manner, was re&s;olv'd not to part with them) If the Gentlemen have left it off, the Ladies have taken it up; and a certain Dutche&s;s is &s;aid to be famous for this, <HI>namely,</HI> that &s;he will out &s;wear any of her <HI>Footmen</HI> or <HI>Chairmen.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<PB N="66" REF="69">
<ITEM>2. <HI>Murther;</HI> in this I may appeal to the Experience of tho&s;e that liv'd towards the beginning of the la&s;t Century, that there was nothing known or heard-of like what we &s;ee now: I mean Men fighting, wounding, and killing one another in the Streets and in Taverns, and coming out of Taverns, and where one Accident of this kind happen'd then, it may &s;afely be &s;aid, that five hundred &s;uch have happen'd &s;ince.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>How often do we &s;ee Men come raving out of the Taverns, as void of Sence as a Man out of <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and &s;wear they'll kill the next Man they meet? and how many Gen|tlemen of good Families and Fortunes have I <HI>&s;een &s;ince I have been in</HI> England, <HI>&s;ent by the Law on that account, to make a trip to St. Tyburn, (the Greve of this City,</HI> as the Greve at <HI>Paris</HI> is the <HI>Tyburn</HI> of that City,) that is to &s;ay, hang'd for drunken Murthers? be&s;ides the Numbers who by Favour and Intre&s;t have obtain'd the Prince's Pardons and Reprieves.</P>
<P>Again, how many <HI>&s;elf-murthers</HI> of this kind too have we daily in our weekly and yearly Bills of Mortallity, thus; kill'd him&s;elf by exce&s;&s;ive Drinking; the yearly Bills give us an Account of no le&s;s than one hundred and &s;ix and twenty in the la&s;t five Years, be&s;ides &s;uch as peri&s;h by that Enemy, who are &s;par'd in the &s;aid Bills, becau&s;e they &s;hou'd not be known; which are, perhaps, twenty times that Number.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">
'Tis another Evidence of the truth of my Ob&s;ervation on this Head, that the Govern|ment have found them&s;elves oblig'd, to make &s;o many new Laws for the more effectual preventing Drunkenne&s;s and Debauchery; (1.) Obliging Victuallers and Vintners not to keep un&s;ea&s;onable Hours; not to draw Drink of a Sabbath-Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Crimes &s;carce heard of in former Days, and which there was no Occa&s;ion to provide again&s;t before. (2.) To oblige every Man that is fuddled, or as we call it, in drink, to pay five Shillings to the Poor, or to be &s;et an Hour in the Stocks, and the like.</P>
<P>Indeed it has been &s;ome Ob&s;truction to the Execution of the&s;e Laws, that the Magi&s;trates are &s;o often overtaken them&s;elves, that they cannot find in their Hearts to puni&s;h others for what they them&s;elves de&s;erve Puni&s;hment for, more than mo&s;t poor Men can do.</P>
<P>As to the Vice of Whoring, and the near re|lation that has, to this of Drunkenne&s;s, I need take up none of your time upon that Subject, only to remark, what an infinite Number of Debauches of this kind happen every Day a|mong us, more than ever were before.</P>
<P>It occurs to me here to tell you a &s;hort Story upon this Head, of a certain Colonel of the Army, a particular Accquaintance of mine, who had an Intriegue with a young Lady, and cou'd by no means compa&s;s his De&s;ign, her Virtue proving &s;tanch again&s;t all his Attacks; only that &s;he had &s;o much re&s;pect for him, that &s;he would have con&s;ented to Marry him,
<PB N="68" REF="71">
but that did not &s;uit, it &s;eems, with his Conve|nience, or at lea&s;t, with his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>However, he found means one time to get this Lady into his Company, and to get a little Wine into her Head more than &s;he cou'd manage; and when her Head was light, her Heels prov'd &s;o to, and he had his Will of her; when &s;he came to her&s;elf, and was made &s;en&s;ible of her Wickedne&s;s, finding her&s;elf in-bed with him, that there was no room left for Regret, &s;he put it off, with a Je&s;t, and &s;aid, well, &s;ince &s;he had let him come when &s;he was drunk, he might e'en as well come when &s;he was &s;ober, for it was all one now.</P>
<P>After this, &s;he &s;ollicited him with all her Skill, to marry her, as he had offer'd to do before, but &s;oon found &s;he could not Ma&s;ter him that way; but at length, &s;he re&s;olv'd to try if &s;he cou'd not take him at the &s;ame Advantage that he had taken her at before; &s;he laid many Snares of this kind for him, but was always di&s;appointed; after &s;ome time, finding him one Evening come into her Chamber half drunk, &s;he took the hint, and got him to accept of a Bottle from her, as &s;he call'd it, and &s;he &s;at and drank the Bottle out with him, and then another or two; till being very drunk, he wanted to come to Bed to her, but &s;he pretended to refu&s;e him, becau&s;e he would not marry her; he an&s;wer'd, he would marry her, and call'd for a Par&s;on, tho not knowing well
<PB N="69" REF="72">
what he &s;aid, or did; &s;he, who had got a Mini&s;ter ready for the Purpo&s;e, having ex|pected what happen'd, takes him at his Word, brings in the Par&s;on, and made him repeat the Words of Matrimony, and had good Witne&s;&s;es of it, and then &s;he went to Bed with him.</P>
<P>In the Morning going to ri&s;e, he call'd her by Name; no, no, Colonel &mdash;, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> not Mrs. <HI>Mary &mdash;</HI> now, but <HI>Mary &mdash;,</HI> Colonel &mdash;'s Wife; what mean you by that, &s;aid he? even ju&s;t &s;o, Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> (and told him the whole Fact) as you &s;erv'd me, before, I hope you can't be angry; <HI>well,</HI> &s;ays the Colonel, <HI>if I have don't when I was drunk, I mu&s;t &s;tand to it when I am &s;ober; but you have bit me in my own Play,</HI> my Dear, &s;ays he, <HI>and made my Lord</HI> Roche&s;ter's <HI>Ver&s;es good upon me.</HI><Q><L>"A Woman's ne'er &s;o ruin'd, but &s;he can,</L>
<L>"Revenge her&s;elf on her <HI>Undoer,</HI> Man.</L></Q></P>
<P>If I was to give you the Detail of the Adventures I have met with of this kind, I might Entertain you with Letters for a great while on no other Subject; it is true, in the Story above, the Man was the Agre&s;&s;or, and de&s;erv'd it; and the Woman was not inten|tionally <HI>a Whore;</HI> but on the other hand, how many young Gentlemen, Heirs to good Families and E&s;tates, have been drawn in by the meer Engine of the Bottle, to debauch
<PB N="70" REF="73">
them&s;elves with &s;candalous and even di&s;tem|per'd Whores? to the ruin of Body, Soul, and Fortune; and how many, <HI>which is &s;till wor&s;e,</HI> have wheedled them in to marry them, when they have done: If I &s;hould &s;ay that this Con&s;equence of Drunkenne&s;s is more fre|quent in this Nation, than ever I cou'd ob|&s;erve it to be in <HI>France,</HI> or even in <HI>Germany</HI> it&s;elf, I believe I &s;hould &s;ay Truth.</P>
<P>But &s;till this is among the Gentry, and does not reach down to the lower Rank of People, of whom I am principally to &s;peak; but is not the Con&s;equence of Exce&s;s in Drink vi&s;ible in all the lower Sorts of Men, as well as the other? how are the very Morals and Hone&s;ty of the labouring People &s;o ruin'd? that now, as I noted in my la&s;t, you cannot with &s;afety hire a Workman by the Day, to almo&s;t any kind of Bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s your Eye be upon him, not only part, but even all the time of his Work; if you do, you are &s;ure to have your Work either &s;poil'd or neglected, or done contrary to your Order.</P>
<P>The labouring People have their Eyes now not at your Work, but at their own Wages, and if they can but &s;ecure the la&s;t, their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to cheat you in the fir&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible; but e&s;pecially, <HI>as to Time,</HI> formerly hone&s;t Men were to be found, who whether you were with them, or from them, would be fairly at their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and made Con&s;ci|ence of doing their Day's Work for their Day's Wages.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="74">
But now the Ca&s;e is quite alter'd; I &s;hall give you an Example of this, before I come to &s;peak more particularly to it: I have for &s;ome Years been concern'd in a large publick Building in the Country, where we kept a great many other Servants, as al&s;o Hor&s;es, and Carts, con&s;tantly employ'd; among the re&s;t we kept an old Servant who&s;e Name was <HI>Wright,</HI> in con&s;tant Work, tho' paid by the Week; he was a Wheel-wright by Trade, and a Carpenter al&s;o, and his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to keep the Carts, and Barrows, and Working-Tools and Work-hou&s;es in repair, <HI>and the like;</HI> it happen'd one Morning that a Cart being Broken-down upon the Road, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e, this old Man was fetch'd to repair it where it lay; while he was bu&s;y at his Work, comes by a Countryman that knew him, and at &s;ome Di&s;tance &s;alutes him with the u&s;ual Compliment, <HI>good-Morrow</HI> Father <HI>Wright, God &s;peed your Labour;</HI> the old Fellow looks up at him, for he did not &s;ee him at fir&s;t, and with a kind of plea&s;ant &s;urlyne&s;s, an&s;wer'd, <HI>I don't care whether he does or no, 'tis Day-Work.</HI></P>
<P>I need make no Comment upon this worthy Speech, it explains it&s;elf; I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to mention <HI>old Father Wright</HI> again in a more particular Affair of this kind; but I am now more properly &s;peaking of the Effect of Drunkenne&s;s, upon the Morals of the labouring Poor; and that leads me to ob&s;erve how they are not only become carele&s;s and
<PB N="72" REF="75">
Negligent of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, when employ'd by others, but entirely negligent of them|&s;elves, and of their Families, notwith&s;tanding they are able by their ordinary Labour, to &s;upport them very comfortably; I had in the &s;ame Building-Works which I mention'd above, a Workman who during the whole Summer-&s;ea&s;on for the Work, which is about &s;even or eight Months, as Weather happens, cou'd ordinarily earn Eighteen Shillings a Week, &s;ometimes 20, to 22<HI>s. per</HI> Week; this Fellow work'd very hard too indeed, and yet he would hardly &s;ave Cloaths to cover his Nakedne&s;s, and his Wife and four Chil|dren were kept by the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>But even this does not fully reach the Ca&s;e I am upon; it would take up more Letters than I &s;hould be able to write you for &s;even Year, if I &s;hould give you a par|ticular of the di&s;mal Effects of Drunkenne&s;s, upon the People of this &s;ober Nation; I call them &s;o, becau&s;e &s;o they were but a few Years before, and even &s;ince, &s;ome that are now alive can remember.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;horten the Di&s;cour&s;e now, my pre&s;ent De&s;ign being chiefly of another kind, <HI>viz.</HI> to let you &s;ee what the general Beha|viour of Workmen, and hir'd Labourers of both Sexes is; how they manage them&s;elves, or to &s;peak more properly, how they ma|nage their Ma&s;ters; for things are come to that pa&s;s now, that tho' Ma&s;ters have the Name of Government indeed, the Servants

really govern throughout this Nation, and e&s;pecially that Part of them who we hire for daily Labour, who if but one crooked Word be &s;poken to them, will turn their Backs upon you, and upon your Bu&s;ine&s;s, and be gone, in &s;pight of Contracts and Bar|gains, and in &s;pight of any Damages you may &s;uffer by it, as I &s;hall &s;hew you more par|ticularly in my next; al&s;o of all the other kinds of Servants among us, for they are the &s;ame in their Degree; &s;uch as <HI>Coachmen, Footmen, Cooks, Maid-Servants, and Men-Ser|vants, Apprentices,</HI> and the like, how they behave; how their Conduct is alter'd of late; how terrible a Greivance their In&s;olence is in the Families where they are; what Ma&s;ters frequently &s;uffer by their Negligence and Abu&s;es; and how hard it is to find Methods for the Regulation of this Evil; it is, I confe&s;s, very difficult, but I &s;hall venture at it a little, and if po&s;&s;ible, by &s;earching into the bottom of the&s;e things we may find out &s;ome Remedy, that the Nation may be deliver'd from one of the heavie&s;t Burthens that ever loaded it, and the mo&s;t difficult to deal with.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with ob&s;erving to you, that I am very ju&s;t in laying the Weight of all this upon that Flood of Wine and Strong-Drink, which this Nation &s;eems to be drown'd in for &s;o many Years pa&s;t, becau&s;e 'tis evi|dent that Drinking is &s;till the ordinary Intro|duction of all the particular Di&s;orders which the&s;e People commit: 'Tis ordinary to &s;ay,
<PB N="74" REF="77">
&s;uch an one is a very civil Fellow, and a very good Workman, or &s;uch a one is a very good Servant, <HI>but he will he Drunk now and then, and when he is &s;o, he is mad, and does not care what he does;</HI> and the general Excu&s;e for a &s;aucy in&s;olent Servant, is, <HI>why he was in drink, and did not know what he &s;aid, you mu&s;t excu&s;e it, he will be very &s;orry for it, and beg your Pardon for it when he is &s;ober;</HI> now it may be, all this &s;hall be very true, and the Fellow &s;hall come the very next Day and beg Pardon, <HI>as was &s;aid of him,</HI> and &s;hall the very next time he gets a little more Drink in his Head be the &s;ame Man again, and as &s;aucy and In&s;olent as before, and beg Pardon again, and be drunk again, and &s;o on in a kind of rotation to the end of the Chapter.</P>
<P>It is remarkable al&s;o, that when &s;uch a Fellow comes to beg Pardon, he &s;hall have the Impudence to &s;ay to you, that he was in drink, and that therefore he hopes you will pa&s;s it by; whereas his being Drunk is not an aggravation only, but an Addition of Crime, and &s;o far from a Rea&s;on why he &s;hould be Pardon'd, that 'tis the be&s;t Rea&s;on that can be given why he &s;hou'd not.</P>
<P>Another Ca&s;e is, that this Drunkenne&s;s is certainly the Parent of Oaths, and as our common People are addicted to Swearing in &s;uch an execrable manner, as that no Nation in the World is like them; &s;o it is mo&s;t com|monly when they are in drink: At lea&s;t,
<PB N="75" REF="78">
Drunkenne&s;s has been the grand Introduction to it, nay, many that will never Swear when they are &s;ober, will Swear in the mo&s;t out|rageous manner when they are in drink, and be guilty of the mo&s;t gro&s;s and abomi|nable Actions in their Liquor; things which they them&s;elves would abhor when they were them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There is an unhappy kind of Swearing, which Cu&s;tom has brought upon this Nation, which is not the Effect of Drunkenne&s;s, of which I &s;hall give you the Trouble of a Letter by i&s;elf; and this is the Multiplication of Oaths appointed by Authority, of which this Kingdom has more than ever I met with in any Nation whatever; but of that hereafter.</P>
<P>This way of Swearing, was in its begin|ning a high Compliment upon the general Integrity, and gave a great Character of the Principles of the People; arguing that they were &s;o con&s;cientiou&s;ly regardful of their Oaths, that what they once &s;wore, it might be depended on they would carefully and reli|giou&s;ly ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>But time, and the frequency of taking the&s;e Oaths, has made ki&s;&s;ing the Go&s;pels &s;o familiar with them, that &s;uch Oaths have lo&s;t much of their Solemnity, and are con&s;equently brought to be of le&s;s Importance, and to have le&s;s Influence on the Minds of tho&s;e who take them, than it was at fir&s;t believ'd they would have, and then indeed, they ought to have.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">
If Drunkenne&s;s and in con&s;equence of it, this vile habit of Swearing have thus po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the generality of the poor People here, as I have ob&s;erv'd; what then can we expect from them as to their Morals, or Manners? you are not indeed, to expect much from their Morals, but far le&s;s from their Manners.</P>
<P>What decency of Expre&s;&s;ion, what Mo|de&s;ty in Behaviour can that Man &s;how when he is gorg'd with Drink? when his Head runs round like the Sails of a Wind Mill? as the Vapour blows when he knows nothing what he does, or what he is to do? when he can neither think or act?</P>
<P>They have a very good old Song here on the Subject of Drinking, which has in it one Couple of Lines, that is much to my Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI><Q><L>"And the Man that is Drunk</L>
<L>"Is as great as a King.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is literally true here; an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> when Drink is in his Head, is a King, an Emperor, Monarch of him&s;elf, and knows no-body, and values no-body; if he be the meane&s;t of your Servants, is your Ma&s;ter for that time; he knows nothing about you, or about your Bu&s;ine&s;s; but will roar and &s;ing, even in your Face, and tell you, he is above all Ma&s;ters, and values no-body.</P>
<P>To talk to him while he is in that Con|diction, is to talk Go&s;pel to a <HI>Kettle Drum;</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="80">
you get nothing but &s;aucy Language, or &s;ome|thing wor&s;e; the be&s;t way is to get &s;ome of the other Servants to have him to-bed, and when he has &s;lept, and is a little &s;ober, he will be pretty well again; but then you have this trouble upon your Hands again, <HI>viz.</HI> That if you do not &s;et &s;ome hone&s;t, &s;taid, &s;ober Fellow, to take care of him <HI>the next Morning,</HI> if he gets but one Mug of Beer in his Hand, <HI>he is gone;</HI> his Head is not thorowly cool, and he is a Madman or a Sober Man for another Day, ju&s;t as the Company he falls into, fir&s;t happens, to be loo&s;e drinking Fellows, or &s;ober and grave, and &s;ometimes he goes on for the whole Week. As this is the Ca&s;e with them in their Drink, it begins to be a kind of a nece&s;&s;ary Cu&s;tom, tho' it be owing chiefly to the Cu&s;tom of drinking; namely, that no Notice is to be taken, no not by the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf, of what a Servant either &s;ays or does, when he is in Drink.</P>
<P>I &s;hall lead you into the&s;e Particulars more to your Satisfaction, by giving you &s;ome &s;hort Hi&s;tories of Ca&s;es, which come up to the Perfection of the&s;e things, and which, I hope, will be both diverting and in&s;tructing; mean time, I conclude for the pre&s;ent, and am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM now to lay down &s;ome things for your farther Admiration in the particular Behaviour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poor, and give me leave, previous to what I have farther to &s;ay upon this Head, to add that, 1. This is all, <HI>in &s;pight of double Pay,</HI> at the &s;ame Time that their Services are <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> and their Behaviour <HI>wor&s;t,</HI> their Wages are <HI>be&s;t,</HI> their pay <HI>large&s;t,</HI> and they have the greate&s;t Obligation laid upon them to be diligent.</P>
<P>This, one would think, &s;hould either pre|vent their Ill-Behaviour, or be a means to reclaim them, when they had broken in upon their Manners; but on the contrary, it is a general Ob&s;ervation at lea&s;t in the Compa&s;s of my particular Knowlege, and I &s;carce ever knew it fail, <HI>namely,</HI> that I never knew a Ser|vant, or a Workman in <HI>England,</HI> one farthing the better for the Encrea&s;e of his Wages; on the contrary, if you advance a Servant's Wages, it is &s;o natural for him to think he de&s;erves it, or that el&s;e you would not do it; that in&s;tead of mending him, it always makes him wor&s;e.</P>
<P>It is a kind of a Proverbial Speech among our People, when they &s;ee a dull, heavy Fellow
<PB N="79" REF="82">
go &s;lowly on in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;ay to him, come <HI>mend your Pace,</HI> and I'll <HI>mend your Pay;</HI> but really the Man's return ought to be, do you but mend my Pay fir&s;t, <HI>and you &s;hall hang me, if I mend my Pace.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Servants and Workmen in <HI>England,</HI> &s;eem to act in the Ca&s;e of their Ma&s;ter's Bounty, as an old cunning <HI>Cart-Hor&s;e</HI> does with the Driver, and his Whip; when the Driver &s;macks his Whip, the Cart-Hor&s;e &s;hakes his Bells; the Driver makes the Hor&s;e believe he will &s;trike, and the Cart-Hor&s;e makes the Driver believe he'll go; but the Carter does not la&s;h, nor does the Hor&s;e mend his Pull; &s;o that the Hor&s;e cheats the Driver for his Favour, in which, (by the way,) he lets us &s;ee that Gratitude is not a natural Principle among Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of the labouring Poor in <HI>England,</HI> is &s;omething a-kin to this; and we find that Gratitude is not a natural Principle among the common People; at lea&s;t, if it is, they are pleas'd to Sin again&s;t it in a mo&s;t unnatural Manner; in a word, their Morals being touch'd as before, that Part of their Virtue, which I call Gratitude, and which is the brighte&s;t Part of an hone&s;t Man, is in a manner quite &s;unk among them: But I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to compliment them upon their Gratitude hereafter.</P>
<P>I return now to the mo&s;t fatal Cau&s;e of all this Mi&s;chief; I mean the Advance of Wages, for this indeed, is the &s;upport of all the In|&s;olence
<PB N="80" REF="83">
of Servants, as their ruin'd Manners is the Spring of it: Here indeed, they verifie what was by a late Author made part of their Character.<Q><L>"The Lab'ring Poor, in &s;pight of double Pay,</L>
<L>"Are &s;aucy, mutinous, and Beggarly.</L></Q></P>
<P>But to return to the Wages, and here I am to ob&s;erve,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That tho' advancing the Wages of Servants has not been a publick thing done by the Government or Legi&s;lature, in the, Na|ture of a Law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Nor has it been done by a common con|&s;ent, as &s;ome publick things have been done; obtaining thereby the ordinary Sanction of a Law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Nor has it after &s;uch a kind of Common Con&s;ent been approv'd or confirm'd by any Authority, as a thing which ought to be; no nor la&s;tly,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Has it been &s;o much as encourag'd by the Magi&s;trates or Government; on the contrary, it is the common receiv'd Opini|on, that it ought not to be &s;o; and that it &s;poils Servants in the main, and yet guided by we know not what Fate, every-body comes into it; the Servants encroach, and demand high Wages, and the People generally comply with it, and &s;o the Evil is grown in&s;en&s;ibly upon us, till it is become a receiv'd Cu&s;tom, and is what it may be &s;aid, ever body does,
<PB N="81" REF="84">
and therefore every Servant looks for; and whereas in common Charity one would expect that this &s;hould influence the ge|nerality of Servants for the better, and help to reclaim them, on the contrary, it is indeed, <HI>the Ruin of them all.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Nor is this Advance of Servants Wages any Wealth to them, but as above, their Morals being de&s;troy'd, this overplus is ge|nerally laid out, either in Luxury or Vanity, that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Strong-Drink</HI> by the Men-Servants, and in <HI>gay things</HI> by the Women-Servants; and take all that little Frugallity which is to be found among them, and &s;et it again&s;t the horrible encrea&s;e of Pride and De|bauchery, that is, <HI>Drink,</HI> (for I mu&s;t be allow'd to call Drunkenne&s;s Debauchery) I &s;ay take all that little Frugallity that is left, I believe it will be granted,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Poor are poorer than when Labour was cheaper.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Servants lay up le&s;s, <HI>take them one with another,</HI> than they did when they were hir'd at half the Wages.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>So that upon the whole, neither the La|bourer without-Doors, or the menial Servant within-Doors, are one jott the better in their Behaviour, or the richer in their Pockets for all the advance of Pay which they receive, which yet in the whole Kingdom, amounts to an immen&s;e Sum by the Year.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="85">
To begin with the labouring Poor, they are indeed the Grievance of the Nation, and there &s;eems an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to bring them, by &s;evere regulations, to &s;ome State of immediate Subordination; their Ca&s;e is briefly &s;umm'd up in two Heads.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Under <HI>a &s;top of Trade,</HI> and a general want of Work, then they are clamorous and mutinous, run from their Families, load the Pari&s;hes with their Wives and Children, who they leave peri&s;hing and &s;tarving, and them|&s;elves grow ripe for all manner of Mi&s;chief, whether publick In&s;urrection, or private plun|der and robbery, and &s;eeing they have not Work enough, they will not work at all, and that brings them to wander, &s;tarve, beg, &s;teal, and be Hang'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>In a Glut of Trade</HI> they grow &s;aucy, lazy idle, and debauch'd; when they may have Work, and may get Money enough to live well, and lay up for a Time of le&s;s Bu&s;ine&s;s; then in&s;tead of Diligence and Good-Husbandry which might be expected from hone&s;t Men, on the contrary they will Work but two or three Days in the Week, or till they get Money enough to keep them the re&s;t of the Week, and all the other part of their Time they lie in the Alehou&s;e to &s;pend it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Juncture of Time, while I am writing this Letter, furni&s;hes me with fla|grant Examples of this kind; there is now, and has been, for near two Year pa&s;t, a pro|digious Run of Trade for all &s;orts of the
<PB N="83" REF="86">
Woollen-Manufactures, of which <HI>England</HI> makes &s;o much.</P>
<P>This Demand for Goods makes a propotion'd Encrea&s;e of Work, and an Encrea&s;e of Work, of cour&s;e produces an Encrea&s;e of Wages: This the Poor in <HI>France</HI> wou'd rejoice at, and any People indeed, that were in their Sences would take it for a Ble&s;&s;ing from Heaven, and it would prompt their Diligence, and make them work the harder, that they might take the hone&s;t Advantage of it, and as we &s;ay, <HI>make Hay while the Sun &s;hines.</HI></P>
<P>That the Encrea&s;e of Trade and Wages is real, and the Fact true, you may take it thus in a few Words, <HI>viz.</HI> The rate for &s;pinning, weaving, and all other Manufacturing-Work, I mean in <HI>WOOL,</HI> is &s;o ri&s;en, that the Poor all over <HI>England,</HI> can now earn or gain near twice as much in a Day, and in &s;ome Places, more than twice as much as they could get for the &s;ame Work two or three Years ago: Particularly in <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk, Ea&s;tward;</HI> and in <HI>Wilt&s;hire, Somer&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Devon, We&s;t;</HI> the Poor Women now get 12<HI>d</HI> to 15<HI>d</HI> a Day for &s;pinning, the Men more in proportion, and are full of Work; whereas before, they cou'd not get half &s;o much, and very often not find Employment neither.</P>
<P>And what now is the Con&s;equence of this? not Diligence, not Thankfulne&s;s, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure you;</HI> le&s;s is it enriching the Poor, or furni&s;hing them&s;elves with Conveniences, Cloaths, and Nece&s;&s;aries; <HI>lea&s;t of all</HI> is it attended with a
<PB N="84" REF="87">
provident laying-up for a time of Scarcity; when Work may be wanting and Wages abate again; as 'tis very likely may be the Ca&s;e hereafter: <HI>No, No,</HI> ju&s;t the contrary; This Pro&s;perity introduces Sloth, Idlene&s;s, Drunk|enne&s;s, and all manner of Wickedne&s;s; in&s;tead of <HI>making Hay while the Sun &s;hines,</HI> they &s;light their Work, and bully their Employers; perhaps they will work two or three Days, or it may be a Week, till they find a few Shillings gingle and chink in their Pockets; but then, as if they cou'd not bear that kind of Mu&s;ick, away they go to the Alehou&s;e, and 'tis impo&s;ible to bring them to work again, while they have a Farthing of it left.</P>
<P>The Manufacturers are di&s;tre&s;s'd for Hands; they have Workmen, but they had as good have none, for they will not Work; the Ma&s;ters beg and intreat, and with Money in Hand, as we &s;ay, they Pray and Pay too, but 'tis all one, no Work can be done as long as there's a Farthing of Money in their Pockets.</P>
<P>If we go out of the Manufacturing Towns into the Country-Villages, there they feel the &s;ame thing another way; the Farmers Wives can get no Dairy-Maids, their Husbands no Plowmen, and what's the matter? truly the Wenches an&s;wer, they won't go to Service at 12<HI>d</HI> or 18<HI>d</HI> a Week, while they can get 7 <HI>s</HI> to 8<HI>s</HI> a Week at &s;pinning; the Men an&s;wer they won't drudge at the Plow and Cart, hedging and ditching, thre&s;hing and
<PB N="85" REF="88">
&s;tubbing, and perhaps get 6<HI>l.</HI> a Year, and cour&s;e Diet, when they can &s;it &s;till and dry within Doors, and get 9 or 10<HI>s.</HI> a Week at Wool-combing, or at carding, and &s;uch Work about the Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>Now, it is true, the Argument on their &s;ide would be very ju&s;t, and &s;ome way unan&s;wera|ble, were the end really to work, and &s;o to get as much as they could by a Diligent Ap|plication to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and then by a frugal, hone&s;t virtuous Life, laying up what they got, for their U&s;e in harder times.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of this, we find the&s;e Wenches and Fellows run to the Manufacturing-Towns; there perhaps, they Spin and Work, and when they have got a little Money in their Pockets before-hand, then they turn Vagrant and Idle, &s;pend the little they have got in revelling, drinking, and by con&s;equence &s;ome|thing wor&s;e, till the Magi&s;trates have been call'd upon to rout them out, to &s;ecure the Pari&s;hes from the charge of their Debaucheries.</P>
<P>From the&s;e wicked Haunts, they &s;pread them&s;elves about the Villages, where they draw in other young People, (till then &s;ober and diligent,) into the like Wickedne&s;s; till we have &s;een &s;ix or &s;even of them in a Hou&s;e with big-Bellies, to the Shame and Affliction of their poor Parents, and the Scandal of the whole Country.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they can drop their Burthen, they fly, for fear of the Hou&s;e of Correction, and away they go to <HI>London</HI> to get Services.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="89">
<HI>London,</HI> like the Ocean, that receives the muddy and dirty Brooks, as well as the clear and rapid Rivers, &s;wallows up all the &s;cum and filth of the Country, and here they need not fear of getting Places; what Servants are likely to come out of &s;uch Nur&s;eries is not hard to &s;ugge&s;t, nor is it any breach of Charity, to &s;uppo&s;e that this helps to fill the Town with a generation of Whores and Thieves, and makes our Maid-Servants recommend them&s;elves as they do: Hence nothing is more Natural than the com|mon Je&s;t we put upon the Country-Girls, when we &s;ee them come up to <HI>London</HI> in the Carriers Waggons, and on the Pack-Hor&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> to ask them <HI>if they have been Church'd before they came from home;</HI> nor is there any thing unrea&s;onable in the Que&s;tion, as things go now in the Country, when Work is &s;o plenty and Wages &s;o high; for who wou'd come away to <HI>London</HI> to go to Service, if things were all well at home?</P>
<P>This is one of the Grievances which we want a Law to re&s;train, and which if not taken in Time, and re&s;train'd, will quickly make Servants Wages as dear in the Country as they are now in the City; and the poor Far|mers mu&s;t give 6<HI>l.</HI> and 8<HI>l.</HI> a Year Wages for Dairy-Maid as the Ladies here do for their Chamber-Maids, and a proportion for Plow-Men, and Carters; of which I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter.</P>
<P>It is true we have Laws here for regulat|ing
<PB N="87" REF="90">
of Servants, and among the re&s;t, a Ju&s;|tice of Peace may oblige young People who are idle, and live, as 'tis call'd, at their own Hands, to go to Service, and may, if they refu&s;e it, &s;end them to the Hou&s;e of Cor|rection; but this is a Concern which the Law takes for Parents, who&s;e Circum&s;tances being but mean, and their Children lying heavy upon them, are willing to be main|tain'd in Idlene&s;s and Sloth, and refu&s;e either to Work for them&s;elves, or go out to Ser|vice; in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the Magi&s;trate may oblige them to go out, as above.</P>
<P>But if the &s;ingle Per&s;on &s;o challeng'd by the Ju&s;tice, an&s;wers that &s;he work'd and main|tains her&s;elf, and is able to maintain her&s;elf without being a Charge to her Parents, or the Pari&s;h, I do not find the Magi&s;trate can com|pel &s;uch a one to go to Service.</P>
<P>In the next Place, as this In&s;olence of <HI>the labouring Poor</HI> is, in &s;pight of <HI>double Pay,</HI> &s;o it is with this particular Aggravation, that at the &s;ame Time that their Wages has been rais'd, the Price of Provi&s;ions has been cheaper than it has been for many Years before; particularly Bread-Corn has been &s;o low that none can complain, except the poor Farmers, who cannot pay their Rents, by rea&s;on of the Cheapne&s;s of Corn; and I am Witne&s;s to this, that when Bread, about 16 or 17 Years ago, was &s;old for double the Price that it is now, the Wages for &s;pinning and Manufacturing, was not much above half the Price that it
<PB N="88" REF="91">
is now, &s;o that they gain'd le&s;s, and &s;pent more, and yet were able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, even then.</P>
<P>This makes good the ordinary Remark here, <HI>viz.</HI> that the poor are always poor; it is very plain, when Wages were cheap, or low, and Provi&s;ions high and dear, the Poor were not poorer than they are now; <HI>and now</HI> Wages are higher, and Provi&s;ions &s;o much lower than it was then, yet the Poor are not richer now than they were then; but this Riddle is ea&s;ily expounded, by &s;aying, 1. The Poor are, (as above,) idle, proud, and &s;aucy, and when Wages are good, they won't work, <HI>any more than from Hand to Mouth;</HI> or if they do work, they &s;pend it in Riot and Luxury; &s;o that it Turns to no Account to them.</P>
<P>While this, then, is the Temper of the <HI>la|bouring Poor,</HI> what are we to expect from them, but that, as above, they will be mutinous when they want Employment, and idle and &s;aucy when they have it? Would the poor Maid-Servants who choo&s;e rather to &s;pin, while they can gain 9<HI>s. per</HI> Week by their Labour, than go to &s;ervice at 12<HI>d.</HI> a Week to the Farmers Hou&s;es, as before; I &s;ay, would they &s;it clo&s;e to their work, live near and clo&s;e, as labouring and poor People ought to do, and by their Frugality, lay up &s;ix or &s;even Shil|lings <HI>per</HI> Week, none could object or blame them for their Choice; but while, on the contrary, they either play half their Time, and neglect the Work they have; or if they

do work, &s;pend it all in Drink and Debauchery, as is too much the Ca&s;e, this height of Wages is by it made a publick grievance; the Poor are ruin'd, even by that which is their Ble&s;&s;ing, or would be &s;o, were it rightly made u&s;e of; I mean plenty of Work, and good Pay; nay the very plenty of Provi&s;ions which was always receiv'd by rea&s;onable People, and e&s;pecially by Chri&s;tians, as the Gift and Mercy of Heaven, is curs'd to them, and becomes their Ruin; for while they have Bread, they won't work, and when they do not work, 'tis ea&s;ie to judge what el&s;e they do, and how they employ their Time.</P>
<P>Again, as &s;oon as Trade receives a check, and there is a little di&s;couragement upon the Clothiers and Manufacturers, &s;o that Work is a little &s;top'd, and the Ma&s;ters and Employers can give no more Wool out to &s;pin, or perhaps but a little, and that in con&s;equence of this; the Price abates too; what follows? why, then they grow clamorous, noi&s;y, and, as I &s;aid before, mutinous and &s;aucy another way, and in the mean time they di&s;per&s;e, run away, leave their Families, and e&s;pecially the nume|rous throng of Ba&s;tards, which, (as I hinted,) the Wickedne&s;s of their Working-Life had produc'd, upon the Pari&s;hes, and wander about in Beggary and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, it has been ob&s;erv'd, that in our great populous Manufacturing Towns, whenever a run of Trade has hap|pen'd, and after it the Poor di&s;per&s;e again,
<PB N="90" REF="93">
there is generally an Encrea&s;e of Ba&s;tards, greater than in any of the precedent Years, and I could give &s;uch particular Examples of this in the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Northern</HI> Counties, as would be &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>Thus Gods Ble&s;&s;ing, and the Bounty of Providence, is abu&s;ed by the&s;e &s;orts of People not to encrea&s;e and encourage their Dili|gence, their frugality, and thriftine&s;s, to lay up in a time of plenty of Work, for a time of &s;carcity and deadne&s;s of Trade; but on the contrary, to &s;upport them in their extravagant Follies and Wickedne&s;s, prompt their Vices, and fill them with Pride and In&s;olence, both again&s;t God and Man.</P>
<P>And &s;o far are they from improving the Advantages of a Glut of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that as &s;oon as it &s;tops, even the very fir&s;t Week, perhaps the fir&s;t Day, they are reduced to their Origi|nal Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s; for having not laid up a Shilling, but ju&s;t working from Hand to Mouth; as &s;oon as the Workma&s;ter &s;tops, the Workman or Workwoman &s;tarves, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd &s;uch as the&s;e de&s;erve no Pity, &s;eeing their wa&s;tefulne&s;s, and the Ex|pence both of their Money and their Time, was in the very Teeth of that merciful Pro|vidence, which &s;uppyl'd them with double Work, and double Pay, and that they had reduc'd them&s;elves by their Sloth to want when they might have been, <HI>as we call it,</HI> before-hand in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="94">
In a certain Town of Note, which I have been well acquainted with, a poor Workman was brought before the Magi&s;trate by his Employer, becau&s;e he would not fini&s;h his Piece of Work which he had begun, it was a Piece of Serge, or Drugget, or &s;ome &s;uch Stuff which the Ma&s;ter had hir'd him to weave, and he had begun it, but would not make an end of it, <HI>or at lea&s;t, not in the time agreed for,</HI> and it produced a mo&s;t edifying Di&s;cour&s;e between the Ju&s;tice and the Wea|ver; of which I &s;hall give you a Part.</P>
<P>The Clothier told his Story fir&s;t, and his complaint was as follows; that <HI>Edmund Pratt,</HI> the Per&s;on brought before him, was a Jour|neyman Weaver; that he had given him a Piece of Work to do, which he promis'd to fini&s;h for him out of hand, and that now he had neglected it; that he had done part of it, but did not fini&s;h it; that he had oblig'd him&s;elf to deliver it by &s;uch a Day, and &s;hould lo&s;e the Sale of it, if it was not fini&s;h'd and &s;ent to <HI>London</HI> in the time; that he had deliver'd him the Warp &s;uch a time, which was about 3 Weeks before; that he might have fini&s;h'd it in a Fortnight if he would work; but that he had not above half done it, and that he lay Drunk and &s;otting in the Ale|hou&s;e, and would not work; that he promis'd him from time to time to go to Work, and &s;till whenever he came to look at him, he was ab&s;ent, and gone to the Alehou&s;e; that at la&s;t, when he entreated him to go to work,
<PB N="92" REF="95">
he an&s;wer'd him <HI>flat</HI> and <HI>plain,</HI> he would not work; that he did not want Money, and would not work, not he; and for this Rea&s;on he came to his Wor&s;hip for a Warrant to bring <HI>Edmund</HI> before him.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice an&s;wer'd him very &s;encibly; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that as he (<HI>Edmund</HI>) was not an Appren|tice, or a hir'd Covenant-Servant, bargain'd with for the Year, <HI>that is,</HI> for a certain time <HI>and the like;</HI> the Ca&s;e did not lie before him; and that if the Fellow was a Knave, and would not perform his Agreement, he mu&s;t &s;ue him for his Bargain, and would recover Damages again&s;t him at Law; but that it was not the work of a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and that he cou'd not make the Fellow work unle&s;s he would do it willingly: However, &s;ays the Ju&s;tice, I'll &s;end for him, and talk to him, I cannot well grant a Warrant for him on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, but <HI>pray go and tell him I would &s;peak with him.</HI></P>
<P>This I mention, becau&s;e I think, if the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are deficient in any thing, it is in this, namely, that they do not em|power the Ju&s;tices to compel labouring Peo|ple who undertake work, to fini&s;h it before they be Employ'd by any other; it is true, the Law of Tre&s;pa&s;s, and of Right and Wrong, gives the injur'd Employer a Right of Action again&s;t &s;uch a Man, and he &s;hall upon hearing, be condemn'd in &s;uch a Sum as will compen|&s;ate the Damage to the Per&s;on injur'd, and perhaps, do Pennance in the County Jail at
<PB N="93" REF="96">
la&s;t; but then <HI>the Suit is long, chargeable,</HI> and <HI>uncertain,</HI> and the Fellow perhaps poor, &s;o that you &s;ue a Beggar, and <HI>catch an Eng|li&s;h Proverb;</HI> whereas cou'd the Ju&s;tice of the Peace determine it in a &s;ummary way, and oblige him to give Bail to perform the Work, or &s;end him to the Hou&s;e of Correction till he was humble enough to go about it, I &s;ay, if this was the Ca&s;e, much of the Mi&s;chief would be remedied that way.</P>
<P>But this Deficiency of the Law, it &s;eems the Fellow knew, and this made him not only &s;aucy and peremptory to his Employer, but very pert, and almo&s;t impudent before the Ju&s;tice him&s;elf, as you will &s;ee.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was told the Ju&s;tice would &s;peak with him, he an&s;wer'd readily, he wou'd wait upon the Ju&s;tice immediately, and accor|dingly went; when he appear'd, the Ju&s;tice told him the Complaint which was made again&s;t him; when he had done, the Fellow looking &s;omething Confident, but giving no An&s;wer, the Ju&s;tice &s;poke to him thus:</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ed.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, &s;o the Follow was di&s;mi&s;s'd, and the Ju&s;tice &s;ent for the Clothier.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Clothier being come, &s;ays the Ju&s;tice to him, well Mr. &mdash; <HI>I have talk'd with your Workman,</HI> and as I told you before, that
<PB N="96" REF="99">
I thought the Matter did not lye before me, <HI>&s;o I a&s;&s;ure you, he has told me &s;o too, in as merry a Manner as I could de&s;ire,</HI> and &s;o he recited the Di&s;cour&s;e that had happen'd between his Wor&s;hip and the Journey-Man Weaver.</P>
<P>He's an impudent Fellow, &s;ays the Clothier, I am &s;ure; he ought to be &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Correction, for his &s;aucy Tongue.</P>
<P>Why, that is true, &s;ays the Ju&s;tice; but yet he &s;poke &s;o warily, and with a kind of &s;aucy Good-Manners, with <HI>your Wor&s;hip,</HI> and <HI>your Wor&s;hip</HI> at every word; that tho' it was ma|nife&s;t he ridicul'd the Charge, and ridicul'd you, yet he was mighty civil to me; and as he &s;aid indeed, I could not lay him by the Heels for an&s;wering me that he had <HI>nothing to &s;ay to you.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Ca&s;e is this, &s;ays the Ju&s;tice, 'tis evidient he has had &s;ome bad Coun&s;el, and &s;omebody has in&s;tructed him what to &s;ay; he demands you &s;hou'd prove the Charge you bring, and &s;o indeed, you mu&s;t, that is, you mu&s;t prove that he undertook your Work; bargain'd to fini&s;h it by &s;uch a Time; and that he has neglected it; and that you are Damni|fied by his Neglect.</P>
<P>All this I can ea&s;ily prove, Sir, &s;ays the Clothier.</P>
<P>Well, but when you have done all, &s;ays the Ju&s;tice, <HI>as Edmund &s;aid,</HI> I do not &s;ee that I can Try the Cau&s;e; it mu&s;t be heard in the Court of the King's Bench, or Common Pleas,
<PB N="97" REF="100">
and the Verdict and Damages mu&s;t be given by a Jury; 'tis a Breach of Covenant, or Tre&s;|pa&s;s, and you mu&s;t pro&s;ecute it in the ordinary Cour&s;e; <HI>&s;o the poor Clothier went away,</HI> it was not worth his while to &s;ue the Fellow, and be at the Charge of a Pro&s;ecution, which, tho' the Fellow was &s;ure to be Ca&s;t, and con|demn'd to pay the Co&s;t and Damages, the Con&s;equence would be only that he would run away, or go to Jayl; neither of which would turn to Account to the Clothier.</P>
<P>Well, however, the Ju&s;tice had a-mind to have another Dialogue with this <HI>Edmund,</HI> and &s;ee whether he could make any thing of him or no; &s;o he &s;ent for him again the &s;ame Day, and when he came, the following merry Dia|logue began between them.</P>

<P>All that you can &s;ay to that is, per|haps, that you have been too cunning for him, that he did not tye you to a Time, and take it under your Hand, that you would fini&s;h it by that Time; but <HI>Edmund,</HI> you mu&s;t not neglect the Man's Work when you have undertaken it.</P>

I &s;hall conclude this Letter with adding another Ob&s;ervation, which I draw from the Story above, and which I have by Experience found true al&s;o, of the&s;e labouring Poor; name|ly, &s;o little does a Sence of Ju&s;tice, or of Gra|titude re&s;t upon their Minds, that not only they are thus In&s;olent in &s;pight of <HI>Double Pay,</HI> but in &s;pight of prompt Pay, or as &s;ome call it Pay by Advance.</P>
<P>Nothing is more dangerous of its Kind, than to Pay them by Advance; and 'tis ten to one, as <HI>Edmund</HI> &s;aid of him&s;elf, if ever you have your Work done at all.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I have given you a Sketch of the In&s;olence of our labouring Poor: It is but too much Influence that this matter, however triffling it may &s;eem, has had upon the general Tranquility of this Nation and is therefore well worth Notice.</P>
<P>They are greatly mi&s;taken, who think that the poor People are below our Concern, it is true, in many Ca&s;es they are below our Re|&s;entment; but 'tis apparent that the many Ways which the Poor find to make them&s;elves unea&s;ie to the Rich, are &s;uch, and the Advan|tages which they have in this Country, by the Privileges they enjoy, are al&s;o &s;uch, that they bid fair for inverting the Order of things; <HI>in a Word,</HI> it is already true, in a great mea|&s;ure, that in <HI>England</HI> the Poor govern, and the Rich &s;ubmit; the Ca&s;e is, in &s;hort, that they clamour their Ma&s;ters into, and out of, every thing they plea&s;e, and unle&s;s Men will be ever contending and &s;colding with them, he can neither Trade with them, or Employ them.</P>
<P>Nay, let me go farther; we are aw'd by the Poor; nothing is more frequent than to &s;ee Gentlemen, bear the vile&s;t Treatment from the meane&s;t Fellows, and that for <HI>meer fear;</HI> pardon
<PB N="106" REF="109">
me, I do not &s;ay they are afraid of their Hands, but really they are afraid of their Tongues; and it is not altogether without rea&s;on, as you &s;hall hear at large, in its Place.</P>
<P>Nor is it ea&s;ie for a Gentleman to live in any Place long, without &s;uffering the bea&s;tly Treatment of the Tongue, from the Canaille or Mobb of the Place; no Conduct, the be&s;t, the milde&s;t, the mo&s;t prudent, can protect him.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If he is ea&s;ie, kind, and good to them, they impo&s;e upon him, and that in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Manner; and no &s;ooner have they done it, but they expo&s;e him, laugh at him, and make their Boa&s;ts among their Gangs, how they cheated him; that he is Ea&s;ie, that is to &s;ay, is a Fool, and how they can impo&s;e upon him at any time.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If he is &s;harp with them, and exact, will not be cheated, and when he &s;ees it, re&s;ents, expo&s;es and detects them, and turns them off; then they rail at him the other way, that he is hard and cruel, will let no-body live by him; would &s;tarve the Poor, and would have a Poor Man's Labour for nothing; and the like.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="107" REF="110">
3. If he is Generous and Free, they &s;train that Genero&s;ity to its utmo&s;t Extent; craving till the mo&s;t bountiful Hand in the World mu&s;t &s;top at la&s;t, and deny, or be blind, and not &s;ee it &s;elf abu&s;ed; and then, whenever you &s;top, you lo&s;e all your Character (for Genero&s;ity) at one blow: 'Tis too true of the Tem|per of the&s;e People, what one of my Neighbours &s;aid to me, from his dear|bought Experience, that if you carry an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> 19 Mile on your Back, and won't carry him 20, you lo&s;e all the Title to his Favour, and cancel all Obligation; the 19 Mile is forgot, the odd Negative Mile is only remember'd: Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you carry him all the 20 Miles, and at la&s;t do but &s;et him down hard, he will cur&s;e you to your Face.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Upon the foot of this Temper, you may expect to hear of &s;ome of the rude&s;t, un|ju&s;t, and mo&s;t impudent things put upon the Gentlemen in this Country by the common People, that you can imagine po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As they impo&s;e upon the Generous, &s;o on the other-&s;ide they hate the Frugal; if &s;ome Gentlemen live more &s;paringly than others, and are more near and &s;aving than the&s;e People like, &s;o that they cannot make a Spoil of them, as they do of others; if they will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be impos'd
<PB N="108" REF="111">
upon, or cheated, and re&s;ent it when they &s;ee it offer'd to them; the&s;e they attack with opprobrious Language, and revile them with Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and not living as they ought to do; with oppre&s;&s;ing the Poor; being cruel and barbarous to Poor Men, and the like.</P>
<P>The&s;e Reproaches, e&s;pecially where they are not Ju&s;t, are very grievous to Gentlemen, to &s;uch e&s;pecially, who&s;e Livesare really blamele&s;s, and who ought to be Judges of their own way of living, as they be&s;t know what they can or cannot expend, or is proper for them to expend, in the Port of Families; and as the&s;e Gentlemen are loth to have &s;uch Cha|racters among the Neighbourhood without rea&s;on, this makes them bear with a Thou&s;and Indignities; and &s;ometimes &s;ee them&s;elves im|pos'd upon, and us'd &s;curvily, and yet take no Notice of it; becau&s;e they would not be mark'd for Severity, or for hard Treat|ment of poor Men; this is what I call being afraid of the Poor; and they really are &s;o afraid of them, that they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be ill-us'd a thou&s;and Ways, when they &s;ee it plain enough, but wink, and make as if they did not &s;ee it at-all, only for fear of being counted &s;o and &s;o, niggardly, cruel, hard to the Poor, and the like.</P>
<P>I was going, a few Days ago, to vi&s;it a Friend in a Country Village not far from <HI>London,</HI> and being come to the Town where my Friend liv'd, but not knowing his Hou&s;e, I rode pa&s;t it, and pa&s;t two more, before I
<PB N="109" REF="112">
found any-body to enquire of; but at la&s;t, I &s;aw a Clu&s;ter, or little Crowd of young Fel|lows &s;tanding together, and chatting upon their earne&s;t Affairs, (I &s;uppo&s;e) they &s;eem'd to be all Servants, four or five of them had Liveries, on, of &s;everal &s;orts; the other look'd like Gardeners, and one or two like Bricklayers; when I came up to them, I ask'd them what Gentleman liv'd at that Hou&s;e? pointing to the fir&s;t Hou&s;e that I had pa&s;s'd, and which was indeed, the Gentleman's Hou&s;e who I was to go to: When I ask'd, what Gentleman liv'd there? the Rogues grinn'd, and look'd upon one another, and laugh'd; Gentleman! &s;ays one; Gentleman! &s;ays another; but gave me no pre&s;ent An&s;wer; I &s;aw them a little merry, &s;o I &s;mil'd too, and &s;peaking plea&s;antly, Well, <HI>&s;ays I, if that is not as it &s;hould be,</HI> pray who lives at that Hou&s;e? Why Sir, &s;ays one of them very civilly, but &s;till laughing, <HI>we beg your Pardon,</HI> we did not laugh <HI>as you,</HI> but at your mi&s;take|ing the Per&s;on that lives there, for a Gen|tleman; if you plea&s;e to take it in our way of talking, 'tis one Dog K&mdash;d, adding the Gentleman's Sirname; <HI>well &s;ays I,</HI> and pray who lives there? pointing to the next Hou&s;e; why that's &s;uch another too, <HI>&s;ays the Fellow;</HI> that's Dog E&mdash;, adding there the Sir|name of another; well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that's very good &s;till; and who lives at that Hou&s;e? pointing at the third Hou&s;e; O, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that
<PB N="110" REF="113">
is a very hone&s;t Gentleman indeed, that's Mr. &mdash;, naming him with a great deal of Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Well Gentlemen, &s;aid I, and made my&s;elf as familiar with them as I could, I &s;ee you are very merry upon your Neighbours, pray let me ask you how you come to di&s;|tingui&s;h thus among 'em? Why Sir, &s;ays the Fellow, Dog K&mdash;d, is va&s;tly Rich, and lives like a Hog in his Stye; does no-body any good, but like a Dog, &s;narles at the Rich, and bites the Poor, and therefore we think he lives more like a Dog, than a Gentleman.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays I, and what's Mr. &mdash;? He's ju&s;t &s;uch another, &s;ays the &s;aucy Rogue, he is worth the L&mdash;d knows how many thou|&s;and Pounds, and he that ought to keep a Coach and &s;ix Hor&s;es, keeps one Pair of Hor&s;es for two Coaches; makes his Coach|man work in his Garden, becau&s;e he will keep but one Gardener, when he ought to keep three; and in&s;tead of a thorow Livery, gives his Men nothing but a Coat, Hat, and Stockings; and is not that a Dog of a Gen|tleman, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Fellow?</HI> and clos'd it all with a broad D&mdash;n him, by way of Elegance.</P>
<P>I agreed to all this, that I might have the re&s;t of it out, and it pleas'd them all mighti|ly, to &s;ee me laugh; <HI>well,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>and what is the Gentleman at this Hou&s;e?</HI> O! &s;ays another of them, that's as hone&s;t a Gentle|man as any in the Country, and he lives like him&s;elf; he keeps a better Hou&s;e, and
<PB N="111" REF="114">
more Servants, than both tho&s;e Mi&s;ers, and gives a better Livery, and has more Hor&s;es in his Stable than both of them, and yet he has not half their E&s;tate; but it may be, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> he &s;pends more than his E&s;tate can afford; 'tis no matter for that, <HI>&s;ays</HI> the fir&s;t, he lives like a Gentleman, and every-body loves him; a poor Servant gets &s;omething in his Hou&s;e, there's Gentlemen, and Ladies, always a vi&s;iting there, and they are as merry as the Day's long, and when they go away, the Servants are the better for them; the two Dog-Gen|tlemen are always at <HI>London</HI> almo&s;t, a Stock|jobbing, or &s;omewhere or other, I don't know where; they are &s;eldom at-home, &s;o that they have no Company, and keep no Hou&s;e worth a Farthing; no-body is the better for them.</P>
<P>I took my Leave of this knot of Gentle|men &s;oon after, gave 'em Sixpence to drink my Health, and rid round another-way to come into the Street again, where I did at fir&s;t, that they might not &s;ee me go to the fir&s;t Dog's Hou&s;e, as they call'd him, where I was really going,</P>
<P>I took this time to think what a Liberty the&s;e Scoundrels took with the Gentlemen, and how &s;ubject every Family is to the &s;cur|rilous Tongues of &s;uch People as the&s;e; for when I came to con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances of the three Families, it &s;tood thus: The two fir&s;t were exceeding Rich, liv'd well, and kept very good Equipages, Servants, Coaches, and Hor&s;es, as many as they had Occa&s;ion
<PB N="112" REF="115">
for, and not very few neither; for I think the &s;econd kept twelve Servants, and the fir&s;t five or &s;even; but they were both what we call managing-Men, that did not with-hold what was proper, as might be &s;een by the Hou&s;es they liv'd in, which are indeed, more like Palaces than Private-Gentlemen's Hou&s;es; but they were Men that did not make Ducks and Drakes of their Money, and throw it away on purpo&s;e for others to pick it up, and laugh at them.</P>
<P>But the third, who they call'd <HI>an hone&s;t Gentleman,</HI> was indeed, of a differing kind, one that kept a good Hou&s;e indeed, but &s;pent twice as much as his Revenue brought in; kept more Hor&s;es and Servants too, than he cou'd afford; run into every-body's Debt; was every now and then haunted with Bay|liffs, and arre&s;ted for Triffles, and dunn'd continually by the Butchers, Bakers, and Corn-chandlers, and &s;uch like People; and this was the hone&s;t Gentleman; and in a few Years he was fain to take up, put off Hou&s;e-keeping thereabouts, and go into the Country to live cheaper.</P>
<P>But the rea&s;on of my telling this Story, is to let you &s;ee, what Treatment the Gentle|men &s;uffer on the&s;e Accounts, and that this is really a re&s;traint upon them, that they bear with a thou&s;and In&s;olences from the People, as well the Servants within-doors as the Workmen and trading People without|doors, becau&s;e of their Tongues, and becau&s;e 
<PB N="113" REF="116">
they would not be made the Scoff of &s;uch in&s;olent Rogues without Cau&s;e; and this in|deed, encourages the Crime, for if they would contemn it more, they would be in&s;ulted with it le&s;s, nothing encouraging &s;uch ill U&s;age more, than the Concern the Gentlemen &s;hew about it; but to proceed.</P>
<P>I don't know any-thing can give you a more perfect <HI>Idea</HI> of the Behaviour of the&s;e &s;ort of People, who I call the Labouring-Poor, than their Combinations in their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; impo&s;ing upon the Gentlemen in the way of their Employments; tho' all Com|binations in order to rai&s;e the Price of Goods, or Workman&s;hip, are again&s;t the known Laws of the Country.</P>
<P>One In&s;tance of this happens ju&s;t now among the &s;ame &s;ort of People, who I have been mentioning; I mean the <HI>Manufacturers,</HI> who in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Cloathing-Counties, (which we call the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> tho' they are <HI>South-We&s;t</HI>) rais'd a kind of Rebellion to &s;upport their In&s;olence again&s;t their Ma&s;ters, and Employers: The ca&s;e was this, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> there has been a &s;ud|den Run of Trade, which has la&s;ted now about two Years, and the Workmen in the Country found that the Ma&s;ters had pre&s;&s;ing Orders for Goods.</P>
<P>Taking the advantage of this, they had twice before clamour'd to have their Wages rai&s;ed, and the Ma&s;ters had rais'd them, and that con&s;iderably; but demanding a third ad|vance
<PB N="114" REF="117">
of Pay, the Ma&s;ters, tho' in very civil Terms, refus'd them; nor were they able to give more Wages, without lo&s;ing by their Goods, and told the Workmen &s;o.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Workmen, particularly the Weavers, form'd a Combination among them|&s;elves, not to Work for the Clothiers, unle&s;s they rais'd their Wages to &s;uch a certain Rate, as they had al&s;o agreed on among them|&s;elves: They carried on this Combination to &s;uch a height, as to gather together in a tu|multuous manner to bring all the re&s;t of the Workmen to join with them; to this End they troop'd about the Towns, and entring by Force into the Hou&s;es of &s;uch hone&s;t Wea|vers as they found were at Work; they broke their Looms to pieces, &s;poil'd the Warps, and cut in pieces the Goods which they had been at Work upon, in&s;ulting al&s;o the Ma&s;ters and Employers in an outrageous manner, to make them yield to rai&s;e the Wages, which &s;ome were oblig'd to do for fear of their Lives, or for fear of having their Hou&s;es plunder'd: On the other-hand, many of the quieter innocent poor Men who would have been glad to have gone on with their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &s;uffer'd extremely, for having Work to do, <HI>and the Wages before being &s;ufficent to maintain them,</HI> and their Families perhaps wanting a &s;upply, yet they dur&s;t not Work, for fear of being Mobb'd, <HI>as above; in &s;hort,</HI> they carry'd this Game on, till the Govern|ment was oblig'd to &s;end &s;ome regular Troops
<PB N="115" REF="118">
down to protect the Clothiers, and keep the Peace, and reduce the&s;e mad Fellows by Force; which was ea&s;ily done, and &s;everal of them had the Favour of being &s;ent to Jail, as they de&s;erv'd; but the Clemency of the Government &s;par'd them as to Puni&s;h|ment, when it came to that Point.</P>
<P>The next Account I &s;hall give, has a little more Mirth in it: In a certain con&s;iderable Market-Town in <HI>England,</HI> there was a Com|bination of <HI>Pump-makers,</HI> that is, the <HI>Pump|makers</HI> in that, and two or three con&s;iderable Towns round, made an Agreement, that &s;uch and &s;uch Gentlemen ought to have new Pumps; upon the Re&s;olutions of this worthy Society, no Gentleman in the Neighbour|hood cou'd order a Pump to be mended when it was out of order, but the <HI>Pump-makers</HI> would tell him it was good for nothing him; it cou'd not be mended, and &s;o his Wor&s;hip mu&s;t have a new Pump; if he thought they impos'd upon him, and that his Pump might be mended, he would probably &s;end for another <HI>Pump maker;</HI> but it was all one, for the other would be &s;ure to tell him the &s;ame Story, that the Tree was rotten below; that it could not be mended; nothing cou'd be done to it; but (ju&s;t as before) his Wor&s;hip mu&s;t have a new Pump; and thus &s;everal of the Gentlemen, it &s;eems, were ignorantly drawn in to the Expence of new Pumps, without any manner of Nece&s;&s;ity, only for the Gain of tho&s;e Rogues the <HI>Pump makers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="119">
It happen'd that a particular Gentleman, a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and of a very good E&s;tate in the Neighbourhood, who was a little &s;harper than the re&s;t, fell under their Management; he had a Pump which belong'd to his Stable-Yard, that happen'd to be out of order, and he &s;ent a Servant to the Market-Town near him, for a <HI>Pump-maker:</HI> The <HI>Pump-maker</HI> came readily, look'd upon the Pump; told the Gentleman the Pump cou'd not be mended, but he mu&s;t have a new one, for the Fault was in the Tree, it was rotten between Wind and Water, and there was no Remedy.</P>
<P>The Gentleman told him he did not doubt but his Pump might be mended, for that it was a new Pump but a little while before, and he would not have a new one again, but mu&s;t have it mended: Upon this the Fel|low told him, he would take it up, and look; and accordingly takes it out of the Well; the Gentleman being pre&s;ent all the while the Pump was taking up, the de&s;igning Rogue was not able to play the Prank he intend|ed, for he purpos'd to have made a hole in it, if he did not find one there; but not being able to do that, he acknowleg'd then that it might be mended, and appointed to come the next Day to do it.</P>
<P>To Morrow coming, and two or three to|Morrows, but no <HI>Pump-maker;</HI> the Gentle|man &s;ent for him, and &s;o for many Days after one-another; and &s;till his An&s;wer was,

<P>To confirm him&s;elf in the Opinion of its being a Trick, <HI>as above,</HI> he &s;ends his Ser|vant once more, and bids him tell the <HI>Pump|maker,</HI> that the Pump which he took out of the Well, had met with a Di&s;a&s;ter, and was &s;poil'd by Accident, as it lay in the Yard, and a great Piece burnt off of it; and that his Ma&s;ter de&s;ir'd him to come and make an Agreement with him for a new Pump; the <HI>Pump-maker</HI> perfectly deceiv'd, &s;aid yes, he would wait upon <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &mdash; , the next Morning, and accordingly he came; when he came, the Gentleman took no Notice of the Me&s;&s;age he had &s;ent, but &s;aluted him thus; O! Mr. L&mdash;, I am glad to &s;ee you; what you are come to do my Pump, are n't ye? indeed you have been unkind, to be &s;o long; the Fellow &s;aid nothing a good-while; upon which, the Gentleman call'd one of his Servants; here <HI>Tanner</HI> (his
<PB N="118" REF="121">
Man's name) here is Mr. L&mdash;, the <HI>Pump-maker</HI> come, to mend the Pump; go with him, and &s;how it him: Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Pump-maker,</HI> I under&s;tood you had re&s;olv'd to have a new Pump; a new Pump! <HI>&s;ays the Gen|tleman,</HI> why you know you told me this would &s;erve, and you cou'd ea&s;ily mend it: Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Pump-maker,</HI> your Man told me you wanted a new Pump; upon this the Gentleman call'd his Man, who he had in|&s;tructed before, what to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob, &s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> did you bid Mr &mdash; come over to me to make me a new Pump? <HI>Yes,</HI> Sir, <HI>&s;ays Jacob;</HI> but who order'd you to &s;ay &s;o <HI>Jacob? &s;ays the Ma&s;ter?</HI> why, <HI>&s;ays Jacob,</HI> I had been twenty times at his Hou&s;e to bid him come over to mend the old-one, and your Wor&s;hip knows he never came; and I found what he wanted, &s;o I told him he &s;hould come to make a new-one; that I knew would bring him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pump-maker</HI> would have deny'd it at fir&s;t, but <HI>Jacob</HI> told his Ma&s;ter plainly, it was &s;o, and that he had been at the other <HI>Pump-maker's,</HI> in the Town, and he would not come at all, pretending it was the other Man's Work; with this he laugh'd; <HI>No, if he bad,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Pump-maker, I would have &s;tuck by his Skirts;</HI> and began to be very &s;awcy.</P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> come, go about it now, and all will be well; Sir, &s;ays the Fellow, I can't do it now, I'll come a
<PB N="119" REF="122">
<HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and do it for you, upon my Word.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I know you can do it now, if you plea&s;e; if you will not do it, tell me &s;o; if not, I mu&s;t &s;end for another; at that the Fellow laugh'd im|pudently, and &s;aid, do if you plea&s;e; what do you mean by that? <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman;</HI> you are very rude; I don't doubt but I may have my Pump mended for my Money.</P>
<P>Do then if you can, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Pump-maker,</HI> for I won't meddle with it.</P>
<P>Well then, go about your Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I will find <HI>Pump-maker's</HI> enough, I warrant ye.</P>
<P>Not in this County, &s;ays the Fellow, jeering, nor the next, and away he went.</P>
<P>The Gentleman finding it was a general Combination of the Society, but re&s;olving not to be impos'd upon by them, waited a|while, intending, tho' it &s;hould co&s;t him the more, to &s;end to <HI>London</HI> for a <HI>Pump-maker;</HI> but at length he got Notice, that at a Town eight or ten Miles from him, there was a <HI>Pump-maker</HI> newly &s;et-up, and who, it was probable, was not got into the Knot yet, and be&s;ides did not know the Names of the Neighbouring Gentlemen yet, or know their Faces or Dwellings; &s;o he concluded to &s;end for him, not to tell him what it was for, or where he was to go.</P>
<P>The Servant did his Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well, that the <HI>Pump-maker</HI> came with him, and manag'd &s;o well when he came, that in
<PB N="120" REF="123">
about two Hours he fully mended the Pump; when he had done, and while the Gentle|man was paying the poor Man, &s;omebody by accident call'd the Gentleman by his Name; at which the <HI>Pump-maker</HI> &s;eem'd a little &s;urpris'd, and &s;mil'd; the Gentleman took Notice of it, and ask'd him what he &s;mil'd at? the Man declin'd it a little, but having mended the Pump, and being well paid, he confe&s;s'd at la&s;t, that if he had known the Gentleman's Name before, he dur&s;t not have come; why &s;o, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman?</HI> why Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we had all Notice that it was re&s;olv'd in the Society, that your Pump &s;hould not be mended, and we dur&s;t not have done it; what then? <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> what was to be done with me? nothing Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> only that you &s;hould be oblig'd to have a new Pump.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I hope you will tell them you have mended it, won't you? No indeed, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Pump-maker,</HI> I dare not, and I hope your Wor&s;hip will not do me &s;o much Prejudice: The Gentleman pro|mis'd Silence, and away went the <HI>Pump-maker.</HI></P>
<P>But the Je&s;t of the Story is &s;till behind; the fir&s;t <HI>Pump-maker</HI> finding he was &s;ent for no more, was mighty curious to know what was the rea&s;on of it; and at length, by &s;ome means or other, come to know that the Pump was mended, and &s;et up again; that encreas'd his Curio&s;ity exceedingly, for then he wanted
<PB N="121" REF="124">
to know who had done it; but that he could not come at by any means; at la&s;t, he offer'd the Gentleman's Servants to give them a Bowl of Punch to tell him; upon this, that Servant that had been &s;o often &s;ent to him, took the hint, and laid a Plot for him, for he ow'd him a &s;hrewd Turn for making him have &s;o many Winter-Journeys for no|thing; &s;o he told the <HI>Pump-maker</HI> that he would not tell him him&s;elf, but if he would come to their Town, and give them the Punch there, that they might be merry, he &s;hould know by one means or other.</P>
<P>He promis'd and came accordingly, and very merry they were, not at the Gentle|man's Hou&s;e, but at a Publick-Hou&s;e hard by: In their Mirth they drank the Gentle|man's Health, and at la&s;t, the <HI>Pump-maker's</HI> Health, that mended the Pump: At length, being mo&s;t of them very drunk, the un|lucky Fellow that contriv'd it all, propo&s;ed to the Company, that they would all go and drink the Pump's Health in a draught of fair Water, to cool them; it was pre&s;ently agreed to, and &s;o they jogg'd away to his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, he being gone to <HI>London</HI> &s;ome Weeks before; when they came to the Pump, they agreed to drink on their Knees at the Spout of the Pump, without any Mugs or Gla&s;&s;es, and &s;o they did; but when the <HI>Pump-maker's</HI> Turn came to drink, whether they held him fa&s;t, or whether they threw him down, or whether he being &s;oundly
<PB N="122" REF="125">
drunk, fell down, and &s;omebody kept him there; Hi&s;tory does not acquaint us of the Particulars, but they pump'd him &s;o heartily, and &s;o effectually, that never was Pick-Pocket better pump'd in the Streets of <HI>London;</HI> and it being withal, a cold Night, he had but a very indifferent Journey home; however, being very warm within, he got no hurt by it; nor could he ever tell who had done it for him, or how he was manag'd, at-all.</P>
<P>In another Place I met with the following Story of a Combination of Thatchers, and 'tis as material to my Purpo&s;e, as the other, tho' not &s;o long a Story: A certain Gentle|man in <HI>Kent,</HI> who had the Management of &s;ome Part of his E&s;tate in his own Hands, and having every Year a great deal more Corn than his Barns would hold, &s;et up the re&s;t in great Stacks or Reiks in his Yard, as is u&s;ual in like Ca&s;es; a Thatcher in the Neighbourhood was u&s;ually employ'd every Year to thatch this Gentleman's Stacks, and his Work generally came to fifty Shillings or three Pound every Year.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Year, that a &s;traggling <HI>Welchman</HI> who was hir'd for Harve&s;t-work, as is common in that County, offer'd his Service to thatch the Stacks, and having &s;hown by his doing one, that he under&s;tood it very well, and could do it much better than they were done before, and cheaper too; the Gen|tleman employ'd him, and he thatch'd the Stacks &s;o well, that he got Work in other
<PB N="123" REF="126">
Places as well as there, and afterwards &s;et|tled in the Country, and took a &s;mall Farm of the Gentleman, &s;o that he became a Tennant; by which, together with the Merit of his Workman&s;hip, he had a kind of a Title to the thatching of the Stacks ever after.</P>
<P>Some time after this, the Gentleman had a Hou&s;e to thatch for a Tennant, a Storm of Wind having blown off great Part of the old Thatch, and the poor Family being Sick, they were in great Di&s;tre&s;s to have the Hou&s;e cover'd; the Gentleman &s;ent for his <HI>Welchman</HI> to thatch the Hou&s;e, but was &s;ur|priz'd that the poor Man told him, he cou'd not do it; that the thatching of a Hou&s;e was done quite another way and with other Tools, than thatching Stacks of Corn or Hay, and he did not under&s;tand it at-all.</P>
<P>The Gentleman then &s;ent to his old Thatch|er; but he &s;aid, no, let him that thatch'd his Stacks, thatch his Hou&s;e; he &s;ent to another, and he an&s;wer'd, no, Goodman &mdash; was the E&s;quire's Thatcher, and he would not take his Work out of his Hand; he &s;ent to a third, and he an&s;wer'd no; where was his <HI>Welch</HI> Thatcher? he had brought a <HI>Welchman</HI> into the Country to take poor Men's Trade away, and he would not Work for him.</P>
<P>This, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> went &s;o far, that the poor Family was &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s'd, and the Gentleman was oblig'd to remove them into an empty Hou&s;e for the pre&s;ent, and buy Tiles to cover
<PB N="124" REF="127">
his Hou&s;e, that he might not be at the Mercy of the Thatchers any more.</P>
<P>I cou'd load you with Examples of this kind, and divert you too, with agreeable Tales upon the Subject; but tho' it would make my Account as plea&s;ant to you as po&s;|&s;ible, yet I would not have my Letters be a meer Collection of Story; the&s;e may in|timate to you, that the Behaviour of which I complain, is not confin'd to one or two Cla&s;&s;es of Men, but, in a word, a general Spirit of In&s;olence and Di&s;hone&s;ty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the People I am &s;peaking of, and the Greivance is come now to &s;uch a height, that it calls for a &s;peedy Remedy; for if &s;ome Laws are not very quickly made, effectually to regulate the Conduct of the&s;e People, the Gentlemen in <HI>England</HI> will live far le&s;s hap|pily than in other Parts of the World; and above all, far le&s;s than they u&s;ed to do in this Part of it.</P>
<P>There are two other &s;orts of People here, who&s;e In&s;olence is &s;o very particular, that indeed, there is &s;ometimes no bearing it, and the&s;e are Hackney-Coachmen and Watermen: The&s;e are two &s;orts of People, who have not the Goods, but the Lives of the People they are concern'd with, in their Charge.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, have once by their over-grown Rudene&s;s oblig'd the Government to take Notice of them, and make Laws for their Regulation; and as there are Commi&s;&s;i|oners appointed for receiving the Tax they
<PB N="125" REF="128">
pay to the Publick, &s;o tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners have Power to hear and determine between the Drivers and their Fair, upon any Abu&s;e that happens.</P>
<P>And yet the ordinary Coachmen abate very little of their abu&s;ive Conduct, but not only impo&s;e in Price upon tho&s;e that hire them, but refu&s;e to go this or that way, as they are call'd; whereas the Law obliges them to go wherever they are legally requir'd, and at rea&s;onable Hours: This treatment and the particular &s;aucy impudent Behaviour of the Coachmen, has been the Occa&s;ion of in|numerable Quarrels, Fighting, and Abu&s;es; afronting Gentlemen; frighting and in&s;ulting Women; and &s;uch Rudene&s;&s;es, that no civil Government will, or indeed, ought to &s;uffer; and above all, has been the Occa&s;ion of the killing &s;everal Coachmen, by Gentlemen that have been provoked by the villainous Tongues of tho&s;e Fellows, beyond the Extent of their Patience.</P>
<P>It was but very lately, that a Gentleman coming out of a Tavern in <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> call'd a Hackney-Coach about ten a Clock at Night; the Fellow came immediately, which made it evident that he was not hir'd, or in waiting; when he came, he ask'd the Gentleman where he was to go, before he open'd the Door; the Gentleman told him, he would tell him when he was in his Coach, and bade him open the Door.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129">
This the Gentleman did, becau&s;e he &s;u&s;|pected by his Que&s;tion, that he would not carry him, he being to go to the King's &s;laughter-Hou&s;e, near <HI>Ea&s;t-Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Gentleman's refu&s;ing to tell him, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that then he would not carry him, and getting up into his Coach-box, drove away <HI>We&s;t</HI> to the Standing where he was when he was call'd; one of the Drawers of the Tavern &s;tanding by, tells the Gentleman, that if he pleas'd to tell him where he was to go, he would bring the Fellow back, and make him carry him; &s;o the Gentleman told him it was to <HI>Ea&s;t-Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>Away goes the Boy to the Coachman, and without &s;aying a word to him, till he was ju&s;t at the Coach-&s;ide; here Coach, <HI>&s;ays the Boy;</HI> and opening the Door him&s;elf, jump'd in, and &s;hut the Door again, before the Fel|low could get down; when the Coachman got down, <HI>turn about, &s;ays the Boy,</HI> not giving the Coachman time to &s;ay, <HI>where mu&s;t I go:</HI> The Coachman after &s;ome grumbling, turn'd about, but would then know where he was to go; I'll tell you pre&s;ently, <HI>&s;ays the Boy,</HI> drive on; when he had gone a little farther, the Boy call'd to him to hold, which being ju&s;t at the Tavern-Door where the Gentleman had &s;poken to him, the Coachman began to &s;ee he was catch'd, and that it was the &s;ame Per&s;on; upon which he drove on a good-way, the Boy &s;till calling to him to hold, but to
<PB N="127" REF="130">
no purpo&s;e, till the Fellow had hurried him down as far as <HI>Fleet-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>The Clamour the Boy made, oblig'd the Fellow to &s;top at la&s;t, &s;o he gets down to let the Boy out; but the Boy held the Door fa&s;t, and would not come out; but bad him turn about again, which the Coach|man refus'd, and offer'd to pull the Boy out, but he was too &s;trong for that; &s;o that the Coachman was puzzl'd, and knew not what to do, but offer'd to go back, if the Boy would tell him where he was to go; but the Boy would not do that neither; upon this, the Coachman got up in the Box again, and making as if he would turn again, turns half-about, and whipping his Hor&s;es, on a &s;udden, drives down by the &s;ide of <HI>Fleet-Ditch,</HI> and &s;tops of a &s;udden in the Dark, whipps off the Figures from both &s;ides of his Coach, having ob&s;erv'd that thev had not yet taken the Number of it, and when he had done this, he drives on again; the Boy &s;uppo&s;ing he had Advantage enough of him, let him go on, to &s;ee where the Fellow would drive him; but here the Coach|man was too many for him; for at the &s;ame time that he whipp'd off the two Figures from his Coach, he had very dextrou&s;ly hang'd on a wrong Figure in the &s;tead of them</P>
<P>The Boy letting him go on, as I have &s;aid, he drove him into <HI>Leather-Lane</HI> in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> and there would have per&s;waded the Boy to come out again, but to no pur|po&s;e;
<PB N="128" REF="131">
upon which he takes both the Hor&s;es out, leaves the Coach in the Street, and the Boy in it, and getting up upon one of the Hor&s;es, rides away.</P>
<P>The Boy was not aware of this for a great-while, but after &s;ome time finding how he was trick'd, he gets out, gets a Watchman to bring his Lanthorn, and taking the Num|ber of the Coach, goes his way home; thinking, <HI>as indeed had it been true, if he had gotten the right Number</HI> or Figure, that he had Ad|vantage enough of the Coachman.</P>
<P>The Coachman had &s;et a Spy to ob&s;erve what pa&s;s'd, who giving Notice that the Boy was gone, he &s;ent another Man with a Pair of Hor&s;es, and fetch'd away the Coach.</P>
<P>The next Day the poor Coachman who&s;e real Number this Fellow had put upon the Coach, in&s;tead of his own, was &s;urpriz'd with a Summons left at his Hou&s;e, to appear be|fore the Commi&s;&s;ioners; but as he had it &s;eems, had no Broil upon his Hands, nor given any Cau&s;e of Complaint that he knew of, he went frankly to the Place, to &s;ee what was the Matter.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, and the Drawer, both appear'd, and made a grievous Complaint, as well they might, and then the Coachman was call'd; but the Gentleman and Drawer was confounded when they &s;aw a Man ap|pear, which they neither of them knew any thing of; the Boy in&s;i&s;ted upon the Num|ber of the Coach, and brought the Watchman
<PB N="129" REF="132">
to &s;upport his Evidence, one &s;wearing it was the Number which was upon the Coach, in which he was driven about by Force; and the Watchman &s;wore it was the Number upon the Coach which was left in the Street, and which the Boy call'd him to.</P>
<P>This put the poor innocent Coachman to prove where he was all Day, and what Peo|ple he carried, which, as it happen'd, he was very well able to do; &s;o it was concluded, that the other Coachman had got a Counter|feit Figure, and they cou'd make no more of it, the Coachman having been too cun|ning for the Boy; but you will ob&s;erve on the other-hand, that had they found the right Per&s;on, which they would ea&s;ily have done if they had had his right Figure, they would have puni&s;h'd him very &s;everely.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. For refu&s;ing to carry the Gentleman, when he was fir&s;t call'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For carrying the Boy away when he call'd to him to hold.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For leaving the Coach with the Boy in it, who, <HI>tho' a Boy,</HI> was actually his Fair, and ought to have been carry'd where he had given Orders.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But the Coachman was too old for the Boy in that, &s;o he e&s;cap'd what he de&s;erv'd at that time, and they do indeed, often e&s;cape, and run the venture of being puni&s;h'd; which makes them &s;till &s;o in&s;olent, that it is grie|vance
<PB N="130" REF="133">
almo&s;t un&s;ufferable; many People give them ju&s;t what they will have, rather than have the trouble of pro&s;ecuting them, and this hardens them; but on the other-hand &s;ometimes they meet with Ju&s;tice, or rather Ju&s;tice meets with them, and then they are handled as they de&s;erve,</P>
<P>The next are the Watermen; and indeed the In&s;olence of the&s;e, tho' they are under &s;ome Limitations too, is yet &s;uch, at this time, that it &s;tands in greater Need than any other, of &s;evere Laws, and tho&s;e Laws being put in &s;peedy Execution.</P>
<P>Some Years ago, one of the&s;e very People being Steers-man of a Pa&s;&s;age-boat, between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> drown'd three and fifty People at one time: The Boat was bound from <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> was very full of Pa&s;&s;engers and Goods, and deep loaden: The Wind blew very hard at <HI>South We&s;t,</HI> which being again&s;t them, oblig'd them to <HI>turn to Windward;</HI> &s;o the Seamen call it, when they tack from &s;ide to &s;ide, to make their Voyage again&s;t the Wind, by the help of the Tide.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;engers were exceedingly frighted when in one tack &s;tretching over the Stream, in a Place call'd <HI>Long-Reach,</HI> where the River is very broad, the Waves broke in upon the Boat, and not only wetted them all, but threw a great deal of Water into the Boat, and they all begg'd of the Steers-man, or Ma&s;ter, not to venture again: He, &s;awcy and impudent,
<PB N="131" REF="134">
mock'd them, ask'd &s;ome of the poor frighted Women if they were afraid of going to the <HI>Devil;</HI> bid them &s;ay their Prayers, <HI>and the like,</HI> and then Stood-over again, as it were, in a Je&s;t: The Storm continuing, he &s;hipp'd a great deal of Water that time al&s;o: By this time, the re&s;t of the Watermen begun to per|&s;wade him, and told him, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> that if he Stood-over again, the Boat would founder, for that &s;he was a great deal the deeper for the Wa|ter &s;he had taken in, and one of them begg'd of him not to venture; he &s;wore at the Fellow, call'd him Fool, bade him let him alone to his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and he would warrant him; then u&s;ed a vulgar Sea-Proverb, which &s;uch Fel|lows have in their Mouths, <HI>Blow Devil, the more Wind, the better Boat.</HI></P>
<P>The Fellow told him in &s;o many Words, he would drown all the Pa&s;&s;engers, and before his Face began to &s;trip, and &s;o did two more, that they might be in Condition to &s;wim for their Lives: This extremely terrify'd the Pa&s;&s;engers; who having a Cloth, or Tilt, over them, were in no Condition to &s;ave their Lives, &s;o that there was a dreadful Cry among them; and &s;ome of the Men were making way to come at the Steers-man, to make him by Force let fly the Sail, and &s;tand back for the &s;hore; but before they could get to him, the Waves broke in upon the Boat, and car|ried them all to the Bottom, none e&s;caping but the three Watermen, that were prepar'd to Swim.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135">
It was but poor Satisfaction for the Lo&s;s of &s;o many Lives, to &s;ay, the Steers-man was drown'd with them, who ought indeed to have died at the Gallows, or on the Wheel; for he was certainly the Murtherer of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I have many times pa&s;s'd between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> with the&s;e Fellows in their &s;maller Boats, when I have &s;een them in &s;pite of the Shrieks and Cries of the Women, and the Per&s;wa&s;ions of the Men-Pa&s;&s;engers, and indeed, as if they were the more bold, by how much the Pa&s;&s;engers were the more afraid; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I have &s;een them run needle&s;s Hazards, and go as it were, within an Inch of Death, when they have been under no Nece&s;&s;ity of it, and if not in Contempt of the Pa&s;&s;engers, it has been in meer Lazine&s;s to avoid their rowing; and I have been &s;ome|times oblig'd, e&s;pecially when there has been more Men in the Boat of the &s;ame Mind, &s;o that we have been &s;trong enough for them, to threaten to cut their Throats, to make them hand their Sails, and keep under Shore, not to fright as well as hazard the Pa&s;&s;engers, when there was no Need of it.</P>
<P>One time, being in one of the&s;e Boats all alone, coming from <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> the Wind fre&s;hn'd, and it begun to blow very hard after I was come about three or four Mile of the way; and as I &s;aid above, that I always thought tho&s;e Fellows were the more ventu|rous, when their Pa&s;&s;engers were the mo&s;t

fearful, I re&s;olv'd I would let this Fellow alone to him&s;elf; &s;o I lay down in the Boat, as if I was a-&s;leep, as is u&s;ual.</P>

<P>The Wind was fair, but over-blow'd &s;o much, that in tho&s;e Reaches of the River, which turn'd cro&s;s-way, and where the Wind by con&s;equence was thwart the Stream, the Water went very high, and we took &s;o much into the Boat, that I began to feel the Straw which lay under me at the Bottom, was wet; &s;o I call'd to the Waterman, and je&s;ting, told him, they mu&s;t go all-hands to the Pump; <HI>he an|&s;wer'd,</HI> he hop'd I &s;hould not be wet, but it's bad Weather Ma&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we can't help it: No, no, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> 'tis pretty well yet, go on.</P>
<P>By and by I heard him &s;ay to him&s;elf, It blows very hard, and every now and then he repeated it, and &s;ometimes thus, 'Twill be a dir|ty Night, 'twill be a terrible Night, <HI>and the like;</HI> &s;till I lay &s;till, and &s;aid nothing.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE, in my <HI>la&s;t,</HI> given you a &s;hort View of the Behaviour of our labouring Poor, who I call Servants without-Doors, and per|ticularly, let you &s;ee that, as I &s;aid before, they are not at-all the better for the advance of Price on their Labour, but that on the contrary, that it is all in &s;pite of Double-Pay.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay it of rational Creatures, and &s;uch as we are to call Chri&s;tians, but I &s;hall be ju&s;tified from the Experience of mo&s;t of the Gentlemen that employ Workmen, and keep Servants, that the Poor are not to be won, it is impo&s;&s;ible to oblige them; no, not with the advance of their Wages.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now give you the trouble of &s;howing you, that it is <HI>the &s;ame thing</HI> in its Degree with the Servants <HI>within Doors;</HI> only with this Di&s;tinction, that the Aggravations are greate&s;t in the latter, becau&s;e their Obligations are generally greater, and they are treated with more Di&s;tinction, of which I &s;hall &s;peak at large in its Order; but I confine my&s;elf to the Particular of encrea&s;e of Wages, in which Ca&s;e it is not my Opinion only, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="141">
<HI>you,</HI> that this rai&s;ing the Price of Wages has ruin'd the Servants, and made them wor&s;e; I &s;ay, 'tis not my Opinion only, 'tis the Ex|perience of the whole Nation; and yet unhap|pily all the Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in <HI>England</HI> are drawn into it by an unaccountable Con|currence of Cau&s;es, which it is not ea&s;ie to give a Rea&s;on for.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The general Complaint of the badne&s;s of Servants, makes tho&s;e few that are good for any-thing, &s;o valuable, that Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es think they can never do too much to encourage them; &s;o they level them&s;elves to them in their Intima|cies, load them with Gifts, with Cloaths, and other Advantages, and the mechanick Spirit not able to make a right Judgment of things, judges pre&s;ently in his own Favour; <HI>namely,</HI> that his own Merit has procur'd him all that; this exalts him in his own Opinion, and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> ruins him; for Pride and a good Servant are as incon&s;i&s;tent, as Darkne&s;s with Light: Thus the few good Servants that come upon the Stage of the World, are ruin'd and &s;poil'd, and that very Bounty which is the Reward of their early good-Behaviour, and &s;hould be the Encourage|ment of their Diligence and Humility, makes them un&s;ufferable; makes them familiar, arrogant, proud, impertinent, and at la&s;t, impudent: But I &s;hall give
<PB N="139" REF="142">
you a long Letter upon the Subject of the U&s;age of Servants by their Ma&s;ters; I am at pre&s;ent upon the Alternative, <HI>viz.</HI> the U&s;age of Ma&s;ters by their Servants, and that under the Obligations of advance of Wages, or, <HI>as I call it,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of Labourers <HI>Double Pay.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Some think that the demand for Servants is greater in <HI>England</HI> than it us'd to be, and I believe it is &s;o; not that I will un|dertake to &s;ay the Nation is richer, be|cau&s;e that might be di&s;puted; but that Luxury, and living is encreas'd, that I believe no-body will deny; that People live more profu&s;ely, keep greater Equi|pages, and more Servants, than ever was done before.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As there is a greater Demand for Ser|vants, &s;o they are not only oblig'd to take up with &s;uch as can be had; but to give more Wages than u&s;ual, to procure them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. There may be &s;omething in the publick Circum&s;tances of the Nation, which has been drein'd of People (<HI>Men e&s;pecially</HI>) by a long and fatal War of near 30 Years, which carried away, if the Judgment of tho&s;e who under&s;tand that Part, may be depended upon, above five Hundred Thou&s;and Men out of the three King|doms, fir&s;t and la&s;t; either kill'd, or run into foreign Service, or dead of Di&s;ea&s;es in the Service, or otherwi&s;e remov'd from the general Body of the People.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="140" REF="143">
5. Our Plantations carry off every Year ve|ry great Numbers of Servants, e&s;pecially of the Female Sex; of which, they tell us, that there has, within thirty Years pa&s;t, above 200000 gone away volunta|rily to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the neighbouring Colonies, meerly to &s;eek their Fortunes, <HI>as they call it,</HI> which, in a word, is the main Support of tho&s;e Colonies, as well for their Service, as for breeding and mul|tiplying the People there; for tho&s;e do not go on the Terms of tran&s;ported Fe|lons, but they bind them&s;elves for five Years, more or le&s;s, and generally when their Time is expir'd, &s;ometimes before it, get marry'd and &s;ettl'd; turn Plant|ers, and by Indu&s;try grow rich; or get to be Yearly Servants in good Families, upon Terms; <HI>that is,</HI> to have Wages, and not to work in the Fields, as at fir&s;t they did; and the&s;e, <HI>as I am a&s;&s;ur'd,</HI> make much better Servants, than tho&s;e they leave behind them in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>N.B.</HI> The chief Numbers of the&s;e Voluntier Servants, go out of <HI>Scot|land, Ireland,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>North</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> many more than from <HI>London.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Now it may be true, that the&s;e things le&s;|&s;ening the Numbers of Servants, and on the other hand, the manner of living among the better Sort, cau&s;ing a greater Number of Ser|vants
<PB N="141" REF="144">
to be wanted; both together may cau&s;e the rate of Servants Wages to ri&s;e, as &s;carcity of any Goods, and the encrea&s;e of the De|mand for them, rai&s;es the Value at Market.</P>
<P>But the My&s;tery of all this is, What &s;hou'd be the rea&s;on why the Servants &s;hou'd be the wor&s;e for it? for that, I refer you to what I &s;aid before, namely, <HI>the Error is in their Mo|rals;</HI> the Money prompts their Vice, and their Vice depraves their Manners; &s;o that very Advantage which &s;hou'd encourage them to Diligence, and an humble Behaviour, is the ruin both of their Diligence, and Behaviour.</P>
<P>I have a remarkable Story to tell you, to il|lu&s;trate and confirm this; in which, not the Bruti&s;hne&s;s of one Servant is concern'd, but after it the Behaviour of a great Number; and I think indeed, it may give you an <HI>Idea</HI> of the general Temper and Conduct of Ser|vants among us; great part of the <HI>Story</HI> I am particularly acquainted with; and can there|fore vouch the Truth of the Fact.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, a particular Friend of mine, (and by that means, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> I came to a true Account of the Ca&s;e) <HI>had a Groom,</HI> whom he took from the Hor&s;e-Heels, to be his par|ticular Footman, or Serving man, to wait up|on him wherever he went; upon which Re|move, he con&s;iderably augmented his Wages; and as my Friend lov'd Sport, and kept a good Pack of Fox-Hounds, he took the more Delight in this Fellow, becau&s;e he was a good Hor&s;eman, lov'd the Game too, and was al|ways
<PB N="142" REF="145">
a keen Sport&s;man in the Field; and which &s;till added to the Value he had for him, he knew him to be a very &s;tout Fellow of his Hands, and had often &s;een him try'd.</P>
<P>This Fellow however, as is the Fate of mo&s;t Scoundrels, cou'd not bear his good For|tune, but believing him&s;elf advanc'd not in Kindne&s;s to him, but on a pure account of his wonderful Merit, grew proud, and in the fir&s;t Place unea&s;ie to his Fellow-Servants, by his haughty Carriage; and &s;ometimes he took upon him to be &s;aucy to his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It was upon an Accident happening one Day in their Sport, <HI>viz.</HI> that he rid over one of the Hounds, that his Ma&s;ter was, it &s;eems, in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion with him upon it; and <HI>Edward,</HI> (<HI>&s;o they call'd him</HI>) gave his Ma&s;ter two or three very in&s;olent &s;aucy An&s;wers, that &s;o provok'd his Ma&s;ter, who was angry before, that he lifted up his Cane at him once or twice, as if he intended to lend him a Turn or two with it, but did not &s;trike at that time; when <HI>Edward,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;hifting from his Ma&s;ter, (as a mode&s;t Fellow wou'd have done) fac'd|about to him; and as his Ma&s;ter's Hand was lifted up as if to &s;trike, tho', <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> he did not intend to &s;trike him; he &s;aid to him, with a kind of a &s;awcy Air, and a Grin, <HI>Sir! Sir! don't &s;trike me, pray don't &s;trike me:</HI> Why Sir, &s;ays the Ma&s;ter, <HI>why &s;hou'd I not &s;trike you? I'm &s;ure you de&s;erve it:</HI> But Sir, &s;ays Edward, <HI>I de&s;ire you wou'd not &s;trike me, becau&s;e I &s;hall be apt to &s;trike again.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="146">
<HI>Say'&s;t thou &s;o,</HI> Edward, &s;ays the Gentleman his Ma&s;ter, &s;miling; (and as he &s;aid to me, all his Pa&s;&s;ion went away that Moment) <HI>Come</HI> Edward, <HI>Thou ba&s;t a good Stick in thy Hand, and I'm &s;ure, a better than mine;</HI> but &s;ince it is come to that, <HI>here's no-body by, and I give thee my Word for it, thou &s;halt have fair Play, and if thou art too hard for me,</HI> I forgive thee, <HI>and do thy be&s;t; but,</HI> he added, <HI>depend upon it,</HI> Edward, <HI>if I have the better of thee, thou wilt feel me a little;</HI> therefore <HI>look to thy &s;elf,</HI> Edward.</P>
<P>If the Fellow had been Ma&s;ter of the lea&s;t Grain of Mode&s;ty, he wou'd have ask'd his Ma&s;ter's Pardon, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> that he did not de|&s;ire to engage with him; and he might ea&s;ily have &s;een that his Ma&s;ter, (who indeed was one of the be&s;t-humour'd Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI>) at one &s;oft Word, wou'd have forgiven him all that had pa&s;s'd; but he was the &s;ame <HI>&s;aw|cy Edward</HI> as before, and return'd in a grum|bling &s;awcy way, <HI>That he wou'd not be can'd by ne'er a Ma&s;ter in</HI> England.</P>
<P><HI>Never hereafter, it may be,</HI> Edward, &s;ays his Ma&s;ter; <HI>but it happens &s;o, I doubt, that you mu&s;t now;</HI> and with that Word, he laid him home a &s;mart Blow or two upon the Shoulders, not &s;triking at his Head at fir&s;t; when <HI>Edward</HI> felt it come hard, it rais'd his Mettle, and he &s;truck again indeed, <HI>as he &s;aid he wou'd,</HI> and follow'd it with a &s;trong Hand, and a good Heart, for a great while; nay, he play'd his Staff &s;o well, and his Blows came &s;o thick,
<PB N="144" REF="147">
that, <HI>as his Ma&s;ter &s;aid, Edward</HI> for a-while beat him a little out of his Play, and hurt one of his Hands, at the fir&s;t or &s;econd Blow.</P>
<P>But his Ma&s;ter, who under&s;tood a Staff &s;omewhat better than <HI>Edward,</HI> took all his Blows upon his Cane, and return'd them &s;o warmly, that at la&s;t <HI>Edward</HI> cry'd <HI>Quarter; No, no,</HI> Edward, <HI>&s;aid his Ma&s;ter, No Quarter; Fight or Run</HI> is the Word, and &s;o follow'd him with his Blows very thick: Well, <HI>Ed|ward</HI> was &s;tout too, and he cou'd not <HI>Run,</HI> but defended him&s;elf again a little while, and then cry'd <HI>Quarter</HI> again: <HI>No, Edward,</HI> &s;ays his Ma&s;ter, <HI>no Quarter I tell you,</HI> and laid fu|riou&s;ly at him, &s;o that he broke his Head in two or three Places: <HI>Edward</HI> &s;eeing the Blood come, was rather enrag'd than daunted, <HI>and &s;aid aloud,</HI> and in a kind of Fury, <HI>What do you intend to murther me? No, no, Edward,</HI> &s;ays his Ma&s;ter, <HI>a broken Head won't kill you; Fight</HI> or <HI>Run,</HI> Edward, <HI>that's the Bargain you know;</HI> and &s;till they laid on a-both &s;ides: <HI>You may kill me if you plea&s;e,</HI> &s;ays Edward, <HI>I'll ne|ver Run for the &s;toute&s;t Man alive, tho' I die upon the Spot;</HI> and with that he flung him&s;elf off of his Hor&s;e (<HI>for the fir&s;t of the Fight was on Hor&s;eback</HI>) and comes up to his Ma&s;ter, in a Rage, and almo&s;t unhors'd him: But his Ma|&s;ter &s;purring his Hor&s;e, &s;prung from him a lit|tle, and throwing him&s;elf off from his Hor&s;e al&s;o, came at him on-foot too; <HI>Edward</HI> &s;eeing that, &s;trove to clo&s;e-in with his Ma&s;ter, but cou'd not ea&s;ily do it, yet after &s;ome time he got
<PB N="145" REF="148">
within his Blows, and boldly collar'd him; but his Ma&s;ter being a &s;trong Man di&s;ingag'd him&s;elf, and &s;truck up his Heels. Now <HI>Ed|ward</HI> (&s;ays his Ma&s;ter) the Fight's over; I am no more fighting with thee as thy Equal: <HI>But now,</HI> as thy Ma&s;ter, I <HI>mu&s;t correct thee for thy Impudence;</HI> upon which he can'd him hearti|ly, and very &s;everely, and the next Day &s;ent him to the Hou&s;e of Correction, where he was &s;oundly la&s;h'd; then &s;ent him his Wages, and di&s;mi&s;s'd him his Service.</P>
<P>Here was a Specimen of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ser|vant, who, had not his Ma&s;ter been one of the brave&s;t and &s;toute&s;t Gentlemen in the King|dom, <HI>Edward</HI> had triumph'd over him; for <HI>Edward</HI> was really a bold, daring, re&s;olute Fel|low, as the whole Encounter te&s;tifies.</P>
<P>When you read this Story, you will blame the Gentleman, perhaps, for engaging thus Voluntier with his Servant, e&s;pecially at &s;uch Weapons too; that many a cour&s;e brawny Fellow may be an Over-match for a Gentle|man; that he ought to have conceal'd his Re&s;entment 'till he had brought him home, and then have &s;ent him to the Hou&s;e of Correction, as he did afterwards; or that at fir&s;t (in&s;tead of caning him) he &s;hould have run him thro', and &s;ent him to the Devil for a better Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But &s;everal Things alter the Ca&s;e; fir&s;t, as for killing Servants for their In&s;olence, that will not do in <HI>England</HI> at all; neither would it be well, if it were lawful, for many Rea|&s;ons; the Con&s;titution of <HI>England</HI> refers all
<PB N="146" REF="149">
Ju&s;tice of that Kind to the Laws, and it would have brought the Ma&s;ter into a Labyrinth of Trouble, be&s;ides the Crime of it.</P>
<P>It is true, the Ma&s;ter levell'd him&s;elf too much; and, <HI>as a neighbouring Gentleman af|terwards told him,</HI> it was a Kind of Exce&s;s of Gallantry to mea&s;ure his Staff with his Foot|man, who eat his Bread, and wore his Livery; but as he &s;corn'd to be threat'ned with the <HI>Battoon</HI> of a Scoundrel, and on the other-hand knew his own Ability to deal with him, it was a Kind of Sport to him at fir&s;t; tho', as he told me in relating the Story, <HI>for I had it from his own Mouth,</HI> He did not think he &s;hould have had his Hands &s;o full with him as he had.</P>
<P>Again, as to killing him, or running him thro', you are to ob&s;erve, that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen (when they are a hunting) do not ride with Swords or Fire-Arms, as you do in <HI>France,</HI> but with a &s;ingle white Belt about them, and a long Whip (which they call a <HI>Hunting-Whip</HI>) in their Hands; and it was by meer Accident that this Gentleman had a good Cane in his Hand; for <HI>Edward</HI> had a &s;trong Oaken Plant, as they call it here, which is a very good Weapon in the Hand of a &s;tout Fellow, as <HI>Edward</HI> was.</P>
<P>But this is by the by; the Ca&s;e was as above, and <HI>Edward</HI> was hand&s;omely can'd, as he de&s;erv'd; and was very cour&s;ly us'd too afterwards, <HI>as I told you,</HI> at the Hou&s;e of Cor|rection, whither his Ma&s;ter &s;ent him; for as
<PB N="147" REF="150">
his Ma&s;ter was in Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, he was capable of committing him to the Hou&s;e of Correction, without another Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>But I have not quite done with <HI>Edward</HI> yet, for he went about the Country, raving afterwards at his Ma&s;ter; reporting, That he had beaten him unmercifully, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> any Provocation, or Fault; that he would have murther'd him, if he had not at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> been forced to re&s;i&s;t him; and that now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> had &s;ent him to the Hou&s;e of Correctio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> becau&s;e he could not have his Will of him&punc;</P>
<P>This grew into a Clamour about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">+try; and it came to that Height, that &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the Fellow Servants began to talk round+ly about it: One &s;aid, He would not be us'd &s;o by any Ma&s;ter in <HI>England;</HI> and that, as they knew <HI>Edward</HI> to be a &s;tout Fellow, they &s;aid he was able to have defended him&s;elf, and he was a Fool he did not; and in &s;hort, they carried it &s;o far, that they began to be &s;aucy, and to in&s;ult the Gentleman as he went about the Country: Once in particu|lar, as he was riding on Hor&s;e-back thro' a little Village not far from the Place where he liv'd, there happen'd to be a Gang of Footmen, and Gentlemen's Gardeners, and &s;uch Fellows, at an Alehou&s;e Door, and they began to flout him, and throw out their &s;au|cy Je&s;ts at him; and one call'd out to his Man, You <HI>Ralph&s;on</HI> (that it &s;eems was the Fellow's Name) have a Care, you'll have a Drubbing next time, it may be: The Gen|tleman

took no Notice of it at all; only as he was riding before on a pretty full Trot, he check'd his Pace a little upon it, and went &s;o&s;tly to hear what el&s;e they &s;aid; and as they were far from being mode&s;t in their Speech, one of them calls out to another who &s;tood over the Way, <HI>JACK, would you have been &s;erv'd &s;o, JACK?

<P>The Gentleman &s;topt his Hor&s;e &s;hort at this Fellow's Words, but did not turn about, or look behind him; nor did the Fellow baulk his Language for his being heard; but
<PB N="149" REF="152">
the Gentleman, I &s;ay, &s;topping a little, and calling his Servant up to him, Who&s;e Ser|vant is that, <HI>&s;ays he?</HI> His Man told him, Sir <HI>Edward W&mdash;</HI>'s; Very well, <HI>&s;ays his Ma|&s;ter,</HI> and who&s;e Servant is <HI>Jack,</HI> pray?

<P>One of the Gang, while the Gentleman call'd his Man up to him, calls out to the Fir&s;t, and with the u&s;ual Oath <HI>Damn me,</HI> he knows you, <HI>Tom,</HI> &s;ays he, he asks his Man if you are not Sir <HI>Edward W&mdash;</HI>'s Coach|man; know me, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Damn me let him know me, any-body may know me, I am Sir <HI>Edward W&mdash;</HI>'s Coachman, I a'n't a&s;ha|med of my &s;elf; Damn me my Ma&s;ter's a very hone&s;t Gentleman; Damn me, if I had &s;uch a Ma&s;ter as he, I wou'd overthrow him the fir&s;t time I drove him over <HI>Chalk-hill,</HI> and break his Neck B&mdash; G&mdash;, he &s;hould mur|ther no more Servants I warrant him.</P>
<P>All this was &s;o loud, and with &s;o much In&s;olence, that, as my Friend told me, he had a great deal to do, to re&s;train his Pa&s;&s;ion; but he con&s;ider'd that they were all Foot|men, and Gardeners, and &s;uch Fellows, Ser|vants among the neighbouring Gentlemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">; and that he might have better Sport with them (as he call'd it) another Way; al&s;o it came into his Head, that this very Fellow, as &s;aucy as he was, ought to have Ju&s;tice done him; for that it was certain by his Way of talk|ing, that <HI>Edward,</HI> or &s;ome-body for him, had
<PB N="150" REF="153">
told a Pack of horrid Lies to this Fellow; and that the Story had not been handed about as it ought to be told; &s;o he went off, and rode immediately to the Gentleman's Hou&s;e, who&s;e Servant had treated him thus, and find|ing him at home, tells him the whole Story, what his Coachman had &s;aid of him, and the Manner of it; then de&s;iring a Pen and Ink, and Paper, he &s;et it all down in Wri|ting, and call'd in his own Servant, who Sir <HI>Edward</HI> examin'd upon Oath (for they were both Ju&s;tices) to the Particulars; and the Servant both remembring the Words ex|actly, and knowing the Fellows, made Oath to the Sub&s;tance of it all; his Examination agreeing exactly with his Ma&s;ter's Narration of the Fact.</P>
<P>When he had done thus, he added, And now Sir <HI>Edward</HI> you mu&s;t give me Leave to ob&s;erve to you, that I am &s;atisfied your Coach|man, and all the re&s;t of them, have one Thing to be &s;aid in their Favour; namely, That they have <HI>Edward</HI>'s Story wrong, and that they under&s;tand I &s;trook and can'd my Man, ei|ther without Cau&s;e, or without a &s;ufficient Cau&s;e, and that I would have murther'd him, and the like; for I have been told the Fel|low does make out his Story in &s;uch a Man|ner, being a&s;hamed to tell the whole Truth of it; &s;o that I find I am obliged by the&s;e Gentlemen (Servitors) to tell the Truth, and make the Story publick, that I may not pa&s;s for &s;uch a Ma&s;ter as your Coachman thinks

<P>With all my Heart, <HI>&s;ays Sir Edward,</HI> for I have been told the Story a great many Ways already, and perhaps none of them right; upon this the Gentleman tells him the whole Story, in the Manner as I have related it above.</P>
<P>Well Sir, <HI>&s;ays Sir Edward,</HI> upon my Word you have but given him Part of his Due; tho' indeed you acted a Kind of Exce&s;s of Gallantry, to mea&s;ure your Staff with a Foot|man, who eat your Bread: I a&s;&s;ure you <HI>Ed|ward</HI> wou'd have been too hard for me, if I had done &s;o: But after all, <HI>added Sir Edward,</HI> what had my Rogue to do with it?

<P>Truly Sir, <HI>&s;ays Sir Edward,</HI> I think we, and all the Gentlemen in the Country, are mob'd by our Servants already; but I promi&s;e you, Sir, I will take Care to do you Ju&s;tice upon my Servant, he &s;hall in&s;ult you no more;

upon this he call'd another Servant, and &s;ent him out to look for <HI>Thomas</HI> the Coach|man.</P>

<P>Sir, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> I abu&s;e no-body: <HI>Says Sir Edward,</HI> Yes, you have abus'd an hone&s;t Gentleman, and one that all the County knows to be &s;o; and you have abus'd him in &s;uch a Manner, as no Villain but your

<P>Say you &s;o, Sir? <HI>&s;ays Sir Edward;</HI> then, I perceive, there's a Combination among you, is there, to abu&s;e this Gentleman? I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, he is a Match for you all, and he may chance to bring &s;ome of you to the Gal|lows, if you go on.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas</HI> replies, <HI>He a Match for us all!</HI> I wi&s;h I had been in <HI>Edward</HI>'s Place, I wou'd have let him &s;ee, that Servants are not Dogs, nor to be murther'd every Time a Ma&s;ter plea|&s;es to be in a Pa&s;&s;ion for Nothing.</P>
<P>Yes, I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;ays Sir Edward,</HI> you wou'd have u&s;ed me as that Villain offer'd to u&s;e his Ma&s;ter, wou'd you?

<HI>&s;ays Sir Edward;</HI> but &s;ince you have not on|ly abus'd a Gentleman, who you know is your Ma&s;ter's Friend, and given him impu|dent Language, but threaten to do the like, and acknowledge a Combination among you, and other Gentleman's Servants, to be &s;au|cy to this Gentleman hereafter, I mu&s;t en|quire farther into it; this is a dange|rous Bu&s;ine&s;s, Servants are come to a heigth, I find, that in a little Time, they will tell their Ma&s;ters what they &s;hall, or &s;hall not, &s;ay to them; I'll have none of the Socie|ty in my Service, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

<P><HI>No, no,</HI> not at all, <HI>Thomas, &s;ays Sir Ed|ward calmly,</HI> bring your Cloaths, and give them the Steward, and take your Wages, 'tis Time to be rid of &s;uch Servants.</P>
<P>Away went <HI>Thomas,</HI> hot and fiery, and &s;aucy enough, even to his Ma&s;ter too, as you may &s;ee; I &s;ay, away he went to fetch his Livery; in the mean time <HI>Sir Edward</HI> &s;ent not a Servant (for they &s;eem'd to be all in the Quarrel, &s;o that he would not tru&s;t them) but one of his Sons to fetch the

<P>When the Fellow had brought down his Livery, and deliver'd up his Charge (as Coachman) to the Steward, the Steward came in to let <HI>Sir Edward</HI> know it, and ask'd if he &s;hould pay him his Wages, and di&s;mi&s;s him, or whether he would &s;ee him again? <HI>Sir Edward &s;aid,</HI> No, no, prithee don't let me be troubled any more with his Saucine&s;s, I &s;hall but be provok'd, per|haps, to u&s;e him as he de&s;erves: In the mean-time it was ea&s;y for <HI>Sir Edward</HI> to &s;ee, that even the Steward him&s;elf &s;eem'd to be of <HI>Thomas</HI>'s &s;ide, and think he had hard Mea&s;ure, to be que&s;tioned for affronting &s;uch a Man as <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>C&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>However, <HI>Sir Edward</HI> (who had all his Mea&s;ures ready, and his Son with the Con|&s;table attending without the outer Gate) waited to &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue, and <HI>Thomas</HI> was di&s;|mi&s;s'd; when he had his Wages, and all was over, <HI>Thomas</HI> wanted to &s;ee his Ma|&s;ter; no, <HI>&s;ays the Steward,</HI> my Ma&s;ter &s;ays he has nothing to &s;ay any more to you, and won't be di&s;turb'd; at this he began to be very rude, and loud, and he would &s;ee

<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays the Steward,</HI> if I do, perhaps you will not take the An&s;wer from me then, any more than you will now; yes, he &s;aid, if he came back, and told him (upon his Word) what An&s;wer <HI>Sir Edward</HI> gave, he would be &s;atisfied; &s;o the Steward went in to his Ma&s;ter, and <HI>Sir Edward,</HI> who had heard all that pa&s;s'd, &s;tood at the Door of his Parlour, and calling aloud (but calmly) to his Steward, that <HI>Thomas</HI> might hear, bade him tell <HI>Thomas,</HI> that if he would be quiet, and not be &s;aucy, he would &s;peak with him again in an Hour, and &s;o he might come again in that Time; &s;o <HI>Thomas</HI> went away.</P>

<P><HI>Thomas</HI> rag'd, and grumbled out a good many Oaths more, but the Ju&s;tice not hearing it, that pa&s;s'd over, and <HI>Thomas</HI> was carried to the Stocks.</P>
<P>While he &s;at in the Stocks, all the Foot|men round about, that were near enough, came to vi&s;it him, and there they &s;at, an Alehou&s;e being ju&s;t by, and Chairs brought out for them, and there was a Con&s;ultation of Rogues, cur&s;ing their Ma&s;ters, and abu|&s;ing <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>C&mdash;,</HI> calling him all the Scoundrels, and Ra&s;cals, that they could think of; and here they treated <HI>Thomas,</HI> and on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> drank to him, and another drank to him,

'till <HI>Thomas</HI> was &s;o drunk, that when he had fulfill'd his Pennance, that is to &s;ay, an Hour in the Stocks, he was in no Con|dition to walk to the Hou&s;e of Correction; but if they would have him there, they mu&s;t get a Cart to carry him.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice, who had &s;ome Spies among them, and particularly &s;ome to take an Ac|count of their &s;wearing, found there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to put a &s;top to this new-fa&s;hion'd Behaviour of the Servants, &s;o he &s;ends to Goodman <HI>Waters,</HI> the Con&s;table, to leave <HI>Thomas</HI> well guarded in the Stocks, and to come to him, which he did; and he gave him a Warrant to take &s;ome A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, and bring away five Fellows, who&s;e Names he wrote down, and again&s;t whom he had taken Information for &s;wearing; four of the&s;e five were Gentlemen's Servants in the Neighbourhood, and the fifth a Farmer's Son, one of <HI>Sir Edward</HI>'s own Tennants in the Village: The four Servants were oblig'd to pay three, or four, or five Shillings each for &s;wearing; and two of them, who were very ungovernable, <HI>Sir Edward</HI> order'd to be carried Home to their own Ma&s;ters, where one of them behav'd &s;o impudent|ly to his Ma&s;ter, that he was oblig'd to &s;end him to <HI>Bridewell</HI> too, and he got there before <HI>Thomas;</HI> the other had his Livery &s;tript off his Back by his Ma&s;ter, and he came back, hallowing thro' the Town, to the Place where they all were, and got as drunk
<PB N="163" REF="166">
as <HI>Thomas;</HI> but &s;ome of the Neighbours kindly got him to Bed out of the Way, or el&s;e he had been &s;et in the Stocks too.</P>
<P>All this made a great Hubbub in the Town, and two or three hone&s;t Men, Inhabitants of the Place, came to <HI>Sir Edward,</HI> and begg'd for <HI>Thomas,</HI> that he might not go to the Hou&s;e of Correction that Night; offering that they would be Security for him, that he &s;hould come, and beg Pardon for his Behaviour the next Morning: But <HI>Sir Edward</HI> was po&s;itive that he &s;hould go, on|ly, whereas his Order was in his <HI>Mittimus,</HI> that he &s;hould have the Correction of the Hou&s;e that Night, he &s;ent a Note to the Keeper of the Pri&s;on, that he &s;hould defer that Part 'till the next Day, and order'd the Neigh|bours, who had interceeded with him, to come to him in the Morning.</P>
<P>Next Morning <HI>Thomas</HI> was not quite &s;o outragious as he was over-night; but he would not &s;ubmit to come and beg Pardon, 'till he &s;aw a fre&s;h Order from <HI>Sir Edward,</HI> and three Ju&s;tices more, intimating, That he &s;hould not be corrected in the Hou&s;e, but &s;hould be carried to the Whip|ping-Po&s;t in the Town, and &s;hould be pub|lickly la&s;h'd there, unle&s;s he &s;ubmitted him|&s;elf before &s;uch a Time; this, and the Im|portunity of his Friends, humbled him a little; and indeed it was but a little, for Matters did not end here.</P>

<P><PB N="165" REF="168">
During this Skirmi&s;h, the re&s;t went up to the Gentleman's Hou&s;e, and two of them asking for <HI>Sam,</HI> (as they call'd him) which was the Servant, who was with his Ma|&s;ter when <HI>Thomas</HI> bullied him in the Town; they told him they would &s;peak with him, &s;o the Fellow innocently walk'd out with them, when immediately they ask'd him, if he had not been before the Ju&s;tice, and &s;worn to the Words that <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;aid? and the like; the Fellow &s;aid, yes, he did, but pleaded, that it was &s;ore again&s;t his Will, but that his Ma&s;ter carried him to <HI>Sir Edward &mdash;,</HI> and there they made him do it be|tween them; and begg'd heartily for his Life at fir&s;t, for he believed they intended to mur|ther him,</P>
<P>Well, <HI>they told him,</HI> they would make an Example of him to all Rogues, that &s;hould betray any Servant to be ill us'd; and upon this they dragg'd him to a Pond in the Park, where they duck'd him, and dragg'd him to-and-again in it, 'till they had almo&s;t drown'd him; then took him, and to&s;s'd him in a Blanket; then tying his Hands behind him, and a Halter about his Neck, &s;o ty'd that he could not untie it, with the long End hanging down behind upon his Back; in this Plight they &s;ent him Home, and bade him tell his Ma&s;ter, That they would &s;erve him ju&s;t in the &s;ame Manner, the fir&s;t Time they cou'd come at him; and that there was

<P>They al&s;o made the Fellow &s;wear, that he would not fail to tell his Ma&s;ter all they &s;aid; but that they need not have done, for poor <HI>Sam</HI> told his Tale as &s;oon as ever he came Home, that his Ma&s;ter might not come to any Mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>By this Time the Keeper was come Home too, but fir&s;t he had been rai&s;ing the Pari&s;h, to look for <HI>Deer-&s;tealers;</HI> and was got ten or twelve &s;trong, having pick'd up a Warrener or two, and their Servants, and a Gentleman's Hunt&s;|man, and &s;everal others, enough to have given the&s;e Fellows their due, if he had met with them: But, as their Good-luck guided them, the Keeper watching for them among the Thickets, and Cover of the Park, where &s;uch People, as he took them to be, might be expected, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s being not among the Deer; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> as their <HI>Good-luck</HI> guided them, the Keeper mi&s;s'd them, and came Home ju&s;t as <HI>Sam</HI> was come in, and had told his pitiful Story.</P>
<P>Their Ma&s;ter, with two or three neigh|bouring Gentlemen with him, was at Home, taking a hearty Bottle (as they call it) all this while, and knew nothing of the Mat|ter; but when the poor half-drown'd Fel|low came in, the Noi&s;e was too great in the Hou&s;e, for the Ma&s;ter to be long ignorant of it; and immediately he caus'd the poor

Young-man to come into the Parlour, and tell his Story to all the Gentlemen.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had he told his Tale, but the Keeper came in, and told his Story al&s;o, and the Hou&s;e was all in a <HI>Hubbub;</HI> every one got up, and the Gentleman lending his Friends Fire-Arms, and the Keeper's Men Hor&s;es, they all mounted, and went in Pur&s;uit of them; but it was to no Purpo&s;e, for they knew well enough they &s;hould be pur&s;ued; &s;o they made all clear off by contrary Ways, got Water, and wa&s;h'd their Faces; and dropt (one by one) to their Ma&s;ters Hou&s;es; and no-body was mi&s;s'd, for they were not long about their Work, and not the lea&s;t News cou'd be heard of them: But to return to <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas,</HI> drunk, and incapable of knowing any thing of what had befallen him the Night before, wak'd (you may &s;uppo&s;e) in the Morning, in a Kind of cour&s;e Lodging, in the Hou&s;e of Correction, and had &s;oon his Friends about him, <HI>as above,</HI> who letting him know his Circum&s;tance, and how the Ju&s;tice (his late Ma&s;ter) had had the Good|ne&s;s to &s;pare him the la&s;t Night at their Reque&s;t; and that they had been bound for him, that he &s;hould ask him Pardon for the Rudene&s;s of his Behaviour; they al&s;o let him know, that he was quite in the wrong to behave as he did to <HI>Sir Edward,</HI> who had been a good Ma&s;ter to him; and that he might &s;tand in need enough of his Friend|&s;hip

&s;till in the other Ca&s;e, for that not <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>C&mdash;</HI> only, but almo&s;t all the Gentle|men in the Country, were re&s;olv'd to en|quire fully into the Affair, and to go to the Bottom of it; for that they found they &s;hould none of them dare to reprove a Ser|vant, or to be &s;afe, if they gave them but an ill Word; and then they told him the Story of the Fellow's Management at <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>C&mdash;</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;ur'd him, there would very &s;oon be a Publication from all the Bench of Ju&s;tices, with a Reward of an Hundred Pound to any one (or two) of the Gang, to di&s;cover the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas</HI> was prevail'd upon by all the&s;e Demon&s;trances, to ask his Ma&s;ter, <HI>Sir Ed|ward,</HI> Pardon for his Rudene&s;s the Night before; and the Neighbours had petitioned <HI>Sir Edward</HI> to accept it, and &s;o <HI>Thomas</HI> was ordered to be brought up by the Keeper in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>But in the mean Time, for the &s;earching farther into the Combination of Servants, which, it was apparent by <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Words, was made among them, there was about five or &s;ix Gentlemen more a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Sir Ed|ward</HI>'s, all Ju&s;tices of the Peace, to take this Fellow's Examination: When he was brought in, he kneel'd down very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively to <HI>Sir Edward,</HI> to beg his Pardon for his Rude|ne&s;s to him, and <HI>Sir Edward</HI> forgave him, and &s;o the Fellow thought to have been di&s;|mi&s;s'd: But he was thunder-&s;trook, when he

been Coachman to a Duke or two, and valued him&s;elf very much upon it: So, when he began his Tale, he told them, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he had liv'd with &s;uch and &s;uch Lords, and Dukes; and that he had driven a Coach and Six &s;o many Years; and that he had never been us'd thus by any Ma|&s;ter in his Life; That he was but a poor Fellow, 'twas true, and they took.

<P>Here the Ju&s;tice, that &s;poke before, in|terrupted him, and told him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This was all nothing to the Purpo&s;e; if he had &s;erv'd &s;uch noble Per&s;ons, as he &s;aid, he ought to have learnt better Manners in their Service; that every Gentleman, that pays a Servant Wages, has a Right not to the Service only, but the Re&s;pect due from &s;uch Servant to him that employs him; but that however, as to his Saucine&s;s to his Ma&s;ter, that was not the Que&s;tion, but he was &s;ent to Pri&s;on for his Rude|ne&s;s to <HI>Sir Edward,</HI> not as his Ma&s;ter, (for he was not then his Ma&s;ter) but as a Magi&s;trate; but even as a Magi&s;trate (upon his Submi&s;&s;ion) he was forgiven; which he ought to be very thankful for; but he was que&s;tion'd then upon the Infor|mation of <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; <HI>C&mdash;,</HI> confirm'd (upon Oath) by his Servant, for in&s;ulting him on the Highway, and threat'ning him, not per&s;onally only, but al&s;o with a Com|bination

of other Fellows again&s;t him; which had in part appear'd to be a Rea|lity by what had happen'd, as above.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thomas</HI> made a long Harangue again, up|on his having &s;erv'd &s;o many Gentlemen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as above; but was bid let that alone, as no|thing to the purpo&s;e, and &s;peak to the Point; <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he knew not what Point they meant; <HI>they an&s;wer'd,</HI> his in&s;ulting Mr. <HI>C&mdash; &amp;c.

<P>Why, what wou'd you have done, <HI>&s;ays one of the Ju&s;tices?</HI> Why, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> be|fore
<PB N="172" REF="175">
I wou'd have been beaten &s;o like a Dog, I wou'd have defended my&s;elf: Ay, <HI>&s;ays one of the Ju&s;tices,</HI> and have murther'd your Ma&s;ter, it may be, if you cou'd.</P>
<P>I wou'd have kill'd any Man in the World, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> rather than he &s;hou'd have kill'd me; the poor Fellow is not murther'd indeed, that is, he is not dead yet, but he may be &s;oon; he was beaten &s;o unmercifully, that he is in the Surgeon's Hands, and no-body knows whether he will live or die; I think 'tis time poor Servants &s;hou'd &s;peak, when 'tis come to this.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Thomas,</HI> and what was all this for, pray, <HI>&s;ays the Ju&s;tice,</HI> was there no Provoca|tion given: No, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> none that requir'd &s;uch U&s;age; he happen'd to over|ride one of the Hounds in their Sport, and that was not with De&s;ign neither; the Fellow lov'd the Dogs as well as his Ma&s;ter did, and wou'd not have done it, if he cou'd have help'd it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Thomas,</HI> and you think this was the Occa&s;ion of it all, do you, <HI>&s;ays the Ju|&s;tice?</HI> Think &s;o, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> I know it, for I had it from his own Mouth.</P>
<P>Pray, <HI>Sir Edward, &s;ays one of the Ju&s;tices,</HI> be pleas'd to let the whole Ca&s;e be read at large; not for <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Satisfaction, (for he does not de&s;erve it) but for the Satisfaction of all the People here; for I &s;ee, half the Town are come about us, to hear the Cau&s;e, and they are all (it &s;eems) impos'd upon as

<P>At the reading this Story, there was a general Murmur among the People, in the Hall, where they &s;tood to hear the Cau&s;e; one &s;aid, he was a Rogue; another, a Vil|lain; another &s;aid, he had not half his Reward, (that is to &s;ay, meaning <HI>Edward</HI>) &s;ome &s;aid, they never heard &s;uch a Story in their Lives; others &s;aid, he de&s;erv'd to be hang'd; and in &s;hort, every-body &s;aid, the Story was told quite another way, all over the Town; and that they had been abus'd in the Relation of it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Thomas</HI> cry'd out, it was all fal&s;e, not a Word of it true.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tices bid him have a care what he &s;aid, for this was the Account the Gentle|man gave him&s;elf, and that he was ready to make Oath of it; however, <HI>they told him,</HI> that as he had boa&s;ted, that if he was &s;ent to Pri&s;on, he knew the Way out again, and that he cou'd get Bail; <HI>they told him,</HI> they thought, the lea&s;t thing they cou'd do was to bind him over to the next Quarter-Se&s;|&s;ions, and in the mean time, to require Sureties of him for his good Behaviour; and &s;o they left him with the Keeper, to detain him 'till all this was done.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="177">
It was near a Week before <HI>Thomas</HI> cou'd get Security, but at la&s;t he did, and got his Liberty; but as &s;oon as the Story came abroad, and how it had really been, all People cry'd &s;hame of the Footmen; and the fir&s;t thing to be heard of (in order to a further Di&s;covery of Things) was, that about eight Footmen, in &s;everal Gentlemen's Fami|lies, were run away; any one might conclude they were thoroughly frighted with <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Story; be&s;ides, when it was known, that &s;o ma|ny were gone, it was ea&s;y to know what they were guilty of: As for <HI>Thomas,</HI> his Fate is not determin'd yet.</P>
<P>There is a great deal more in the Hi&s;tory of this Affair, but it is not &s;ignificant enough to trouble you with; you will &s;ee thro' ev'ry Part of what I have written; an Air of uncommon In&s;olence, upon the Conduct of Servants all the Country round, and that is the Rea&s;on of my giving you this Account: Before I di&s;mi&s;s this Subject, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, That this in&s;olent Behaviour is not among the fal&s;e and thievi&s;h Servants (&s;uch we may always expect to be impudent;) but this is the Conduct of the hone&s;t Part of Servants, at lea&s;t tho&s;e we call hone&s;t: I cou'd give you an Account of Servants robbing, ay, and murthering their Ma&s;ters, and tho&s;e now more than ever; but a|mong &s;uch, nothing is to be wonder'd at, and &s;uch are in all Nations as well as here; but I confine my &s;elf to the Point in hand, name|ly,

<P>Nor is it every Servant that will fight his Ma&s;ter, as <HI>Edward</HI> did, becau&s;e it is not every Servant that dares do it; but I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that there is not one Servant in twen|ty now, that will take a Blow from a Ma&s;ter, but with their Tongues will in&s;ult them at that rate, that it is very hard for any Gen|tleman to bear it; nor do I wonder at any thing more, than that there are not ten Servants for one kill'd by their Ma&s;ters, the Treatment which Ma&s;ters receive from them, being now &s;uch, as indeed 'tis very hard for any Temper to &s;ubmit to: I &s;hall give you &s;ome In&s;tances of this Kind in my next Letter.</P>

<P>There happen'd, in a Country Town, with|in about Eleven Miles of <HI>London,</HI> a very odd Pa&s;&s;age of a Servant and a Ma&s;ter, which ended more tragical than that in my La&s;t: The Gentleman was a Colonel in the <HI>Mili|tia,</HI> and of a very good E&s;tate, and had on|ly two Daughters; his elde&s;t Daughter, a fine beautiful Lady, and very well bred, was &s;aid to be in Love with &s;ome-body, but it cou'd never be found out who it was with: She was &s;o un&s;u&s;pected by her Father (as to her Vertue) that there was no need to keep any Watch over her: She often took the Coach (or the Chariot) with her Si&s;ter, to go to <HI>London,</HI> or any where el&s;e, and &s;ometimes without her, but always came home in good time; and if her Father ask'd her, at any time, where &s;he had been been, &s;he wou'd &s;ay, &s;he only took a turn out upon the Forre&s;t, or upon &s;uch a Heath, or &s;uch a Way, for the Air; which was an An&s;wer &s;atisfying enough; and &s;ometimes (without the lea&s;t Su&s;picion in his Head) he wou'd ask the Coachman, which Way he drove, or how far? And he wou'd give him the like An&s;wer.</P>
<P>This pa&s;s'd for a great while, 'till it was ob&s;erv'd at la&s;t, that &s;he took the Chariot out (for airing) without her Si&s;ter, or any-body el&s;e with her, oftner than u&s;ual; and her Father,
<PB N="178" REF="181">
who had heard a Rumour, that his Daugh|ter had an Amour with &s;ome-body, began to &s;u&s;pect; upon this Su&s;picion (one Evening) he examin'd the Coachman, in a friend|ly obliging manner, whether any-body met his Daughter upon tho&s;e Airings and Ridings out? The Fellow, with a &s;awcy Fleer at him, &s;aid, <HI>No,</HI> and laugh'd; this mov'd him a little, and he call'd him &s;awcy Fellow, or &s;omething to that purpo&s;e; Why, Sir, do you think, <HI>&s;ays the Coachman,</HI> that if my young Mi&s;tre&s;s had any Love-Intrigue with any-body, and tru&s;ted me to carry her, I wou'd betray her, and tell you of it?</P>
<P>Very well, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> then you may &s;ay, you will be faithful to my Daugh|ter, but you cou'd not boa&s;t of much Ho|ne&s;ty to your Ma&s;ter; 'tis no matter for that, Sir, <HI>&s;ays be,</HI> I never betray my Tru&s;t; yes, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> you do in that very thing, for as you are my Servant, when you carry her abroad, 'tis I tru&s;t my Daugh|ter in your Hands: I think nothing of that, <HI>&s;ays the Fellow,</HI> 'tis the Lady tru&s;ts me with her&s;elf, and that's more than you tru&s;t me with.</P>
<P>Well, well, if that be your Principle, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> then I &s;hall tru&s;t you no more with her, and you &s;hall carry her out no more: However, it happen'd, that about a Week after, or thereabout, the young Lady call'd her Coachman (her Father being from home) and rode out as u&s;ual; the Colonel, co|ming
<PB N="179" REF="182">
home, while they were abroad, and hearing of it, never lighted off his Hor&s;e, but rode about, to &s;ee if he cou'd meet her any where, and di&s;cover any thing.</P>
<P>It was his Misfortune to ride round and round the Country, a great way, but not to meet with them; but being ju&s;t come back, &s;o near, as that he was within &s;ight of his own Door, <HI>if it had been Day-light,</HI> he heard the Coach &s;top ju&s;t before him; upon this, he &s;top'd, and got off of his Hor&s;e, and hang|ing his Bridle to another Door, &s;tept for|ward on the other &s;ide (it being very dark) believing he &s;hou'd &s;ee &s;ome Spark or other come home with his Daughter, to bring her to the Door; and he was the more con|firm'd in his Expectation, when he &s;aw the Coach &s;top a little &s;hort of the Door.</P>
<P>But judge what Rage, what Horror mu&s;t take hold of his Soul, when he &s;aw the Coachman (after opening the Coach-Door to his Daughter) take her out of the Coach in his Arms, and holding her in his Arms a good while, ki&s;s her &s;everal times, and &s;he (on the other-hand) throwing one of her Arms about his Neck, give him leave to do it, as long as he wou'd.</P>
<P>Blame not the Gentleman, if he had not Patience enough to re&s;train his Pa&s;&s;ion, at this killing Sight; but, he run in upon them, <HI>Unhand her, Villain!</HI> &s;aid he to the Coachman, <HI>or I'll this Minute &s;end you to the Devil:</HI> The Fellow (&s;urpriz'd you may
<PB N="180" REF="183">
&s;uppo&s;e) &s;et her down, but gave his Ma&s;ter the mo&s;t impudent Language imaginable; and which the Gentleman not able to take, gave him a large Cut over the Face, with his Sword; I'll mark thee now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for a Dog, that I may know thee again to morrow.</P>
<P>The Fellow cry'd Murther at fir&s;t, but immediately flying back, gave his Ma&s;ter two or three La&s;hes, with his Whip, and was coming at him (in a Rage) with the thick End of it, when, the frighted Lady having rung the Bell, other Servants came, and open'd the Door, and the Ma&s;ter &s;tept in, which put an End to the Fray for that time.</P>
<P>Then the Gentleman came to the Door again, and pull'd in his Daughter; <HI>Come, Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Come you in, I'll take care of you, whatever I do with him:</HI> The Lady was terribly frighted to be &s;ure; however, the Fellow drove the Coach round into the Stable-Yard, and having put up the Hor&s;es, &s;ent one of the Servants in, to tell his Ma&s;ter, he de&s;ir'd he might &s;end for a Surgeon; his Ma&s;ter &s;ent Word, he might go to a Surgeon's, if he wou'd, for he &s;hou'd &s;leep no more in his Hou&s;e: He &s;ent Word again, very &s;awcily, he wou'd not &s;tir in that Condition, and at that time of Night, but that in the Morning he wou'd let him know more of his Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="184">
However, the Gentleman was per&s;waded to let him &s;tay that Night, his Lodging-Room be|ing over the Coach-Hou&s;e, and &s;o not within the Dwelling-Hou&s;e, and locking up his Daughter in her Chamber, he &s;at up him|&s;elf, to &s;ee that no Mi&s;chief might happen: In the dead of the Night, he heard &s;ome Noi&s;e in the Yard, and putting him&s;elf in a Po&s;ture to hear as much as he cou'd of it, and not to be di&s;cover'd, he heard his Daughter calling out, at a little Window, to the Coachman, to ask him how he did; and telling him, &s;he wou'd find &s;ome way or other to come out, the next Day, to him, for all this, with &s;ome other little Tenderne&s;&s;es between them; which, howe|ver, &s;erv'd to inform him how Things were: He re&s;train'd his Pa&s;&s;ion, and did not di&s;cover him&s;elf at all, but took care of her Chamber-Door, and that &s;he &s;hou'd not get out of the Window.</P>
<P>The next Morning he call'd his Coachman to him, paid him his Wages, and di&s;mi&s;s'd him: The Coachman &s;aid nothing to him, but look'd and behav'd &s;urlily, 'till he was paid, and was going away, as he thought, when he turn'd &s;hort upon him, and told him &s;aucily, He hop'd he wou'd give him &s;ome Satisfaction for cutting him on the Face; <HI>his Ma&s;ter an&s;wer'd,</HI> He ought to be thankful to him, he had not cut his Throat.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="185">
For what, <HI>&s;ays the Coachman?</HI></P>
<P>For your Impudence, <HI>&s;ays the Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Coachman &s;aid &s;omething very rude, upon that, about his Daughter; intimating, that tho' he was but a poor Servant now, yet he was a Gentleman born, and of as good a Family as he (meaning his Ma&s;ter) and 'twas no Di&s;honour to his Daughter to engage with him; for, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have as good Blood in my Veins as your|&s;elf, with &s;ome other Language, which the Colonel cou'd not bear; upon which, he took his Sword in his Hand, which lay on the Table, and opening the Door, &s;aid (with a little Smile) Then, Sir, if you don't immediatly get out of my Hou&s;e, I'll let &s;ome of your Gentlemanly Blood out for you, and that pre&s;ently too.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Coachman,</HI> I am none of your Servant, <HI>now,</HI> but as good a Man as your &s;elf: This provok'd the Colonel farther, and he ro&s;e up (tho' in his Gown and Slippers) and thru&s;t the Villain out of his Door, and kick'd him down the Steps.</P>
<P>When the Fellow was out, he fac'd him again; Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> go tell your Daughter, you owe your Life to Her, and were it not for her &s;ake, I'd trample you under my Feet this Moment.</P>
<P>The Colonel was not a Match for the Brute, perhaps, at his Fi&s;t (tho' in Courage infinitely &s;uperior) but flies into his Parlour for his Sword, and comes in&s;tantly out
<PB N="183" REF="186">
to him again, but he was gone a little way from the Door; he call'd after him, <HI>but he an&s;wer'd,</HI> he wou'd go but a little way farther, and wait on him again, <HI>by and by.</HI></P>
<P>About two Hours after, the Fellow comes again, dre&s;s'd up very genteely, and a Sword by his &s;ide, and two Fellows with him.</P>
<P>When his Ma&s;ter &s;aw them, he call'd one of his Servants, and bade him go to the Stable, and fetch him two Pitchforks, <HI>for,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I'll deal with this Dog in his own way;</HI> accordingly the Servant brought them, and he bade him, and his Fellow-Servant, keep in the next Room with them, and not &s;hew them&s;elves, unle&s;s he call'd them.</P>
<P>When this was done, he bade a Maid-Servant go, and de&s;ire the two Men, that were with the Coachman, to walk in, and bid the Coachman &s;tay without.</P>
<P>When they were come in, he treated them very courteou&s;ly, and ask'd them, <HI>if they had any particular Bu&s;ine&s;s with him?</HI> They an&s;wer'd, very civily too, that their Bu&s;ine&s;s was only this; that <HI>William,</HI> his Coachman, had de&s;ir'd them to come with him; that he had been wounded by him, the Evening before, in his Pa&s;&s;ion; and that he was afraid, he might be in Danger again; and that he de&s;ir'd them to come with him, to prevent any Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">
<HI>Pray, Gentlemen,</HI> &s;ays the Colonel, <HI>did he acquaint you with the Rea&s;on of my being &s;o provok'd? They an&s;wer'd,</HI> No; only that he had &s;aid, it was without any Provocation at all.</P>
<P>It's the only obliging thing, <HI>&s;ays the Colo|nel,</HI> that <HI>William</HI> cou'd do; but depend up|on it, Gentlemen, I cou'd never be guilty of u&s;ing a Servant &s;o hardly, as cutting him over the Face, if I had not had the greate&s;t Provocation in the World.</P>
<P>As to that, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> they knew nothing of it, and if they had, they wou'd not have appear'd in it, for they wou'd not countenance any Servant in abu&s;ing his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Well but, Pray, Gentlemen, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> what need is there to bring you to guard him, now he is out of my Service, and has no Bu&s;ine&s;s with me? If he does not come in my Reach, I can do him no Hurt, and my be&s;t Advice to him is, to keep out of my way.</P>
<P>But, Sir, <HI>&s;ays one of the Men,</HI> he &s;ays, his Bu&s;ine&s;s now was to &s;ee, what Satisfaction you will give him, for wounding him.</P>
<P><HI>Says the Colonel,</HI> my An&s;wer to that is plain; what the Law will give him, I'll &s;ubmit to, I &s;hall give him no more Sa|tisfaction; I &s;uppo&s;e, he does not come to to challenge me; if he thinks, he has not merited much more than I gave him, I leave him to take any Cour&s;e he plea&s;es: Pray,
<PB N="185" REF="188">
what Satisfaction does he demand, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> have you any thing to offer in his Name? I am ready to an&s;wer, as be|comes me, in any Ca&s;e, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> and if he had been a Gentleman, and indeed any thing but my own Servant, I knew what An&s;wer to make.</P>
<P>N.B. <HI>Here the Colonel began to imagine a</HI> Challenge; <HI>but they had not any In&s;tructions,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>not fore&s;eeing they &s;hou'd &s;peak with him fir&s;t, or alone.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, Gentlemen, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> tell him from me, I have no Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, and I think he has none with me; if he keeps away from my Hou&s;e, he has nothing to fear from me, and &s;o <HI>needs no Guard;</HI> and with this he di&s;mi&s;s'd them.</P>
<P>When they were gone, he perceiv'd, that when they came to the Door where the Coachman waited, and gave an Account to him of the Di&s;cour&s;e they had with his Ma&s;ter, he appear'd <HI>very unea&s;ie;</HI> that he came from them twice (in a Kind of a Pa&s;|&s;ion) towards the Door, but that they call'd him back again: But, however, he came on the third time; and the Colonel ob&s;erv'd, that when he came from them, <HI>the third time,</HI> they &s;hook their Heads, and went away, as if they had &s;aid, <HI>If you will go, we will have nothing to do with you:</HI> How|ever, he came to the Gate, and knock'd (or rung) very hard; the Colonel, who had &s;een him, order'd his Servants not to open
<PB N="186" REF="189">
the Gate, but let him knock (or ring) a|while; at length, He order'd one of his Men, to go out at the Back-door, and come round, and &s;tand in a Place in the Yard, which was on one &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, where he might &s;peak to him out at Window, and where the Fellow at the Gate might &s;ee him too.</P>
<P>When the Servant was come to the Place, his Ma&s;ter call'd to him aloud, <HI>John,</HI> what does <HI>that Fellow</HI> want, that rings at the Gate there? <HI>John an&s;wer'd,</HI> 'tis <HI>William,</HI> Sir. <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays his Ma&s;ter, <HI>I know that, what wou'd he have?</HI> The Coachman an&s;wer'd, <HI>I wou'd &s;peak with you, Sir:</HI> The Colonel an&s;wer'd nothing to him; upon which, <HI>John,</HI> the Servant, &s;aid, <HI>He &s;ays he wou'd &s;peak with you, Sir,</HI> Tell him, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> I have nothing to &s;ay to him, bid him go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William</HI> wou'd not &s;tir, but call'd to his Ma&s;ter aloud, <HI>Tho' you have nothing to &s;ay to me, you may bear what I have to &s;ay to you: I tell thee, FELLOW,</HI> &s;ays the Colonel, <HI>I have no Bu&s;ine&s;s with thee, and will have none with thee.</HI></P>
<P>Then he de&s;ir'd he might be admitted to &s;peak with his Daughter; that he rejected with Indignation, and in &s;ome har&s;h Terms: Why, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> I de&s;ire but to &s;peak with her at the Window, and in your Hear|ing; I am not a&s;ham'd you &s;hou'd hear what I have to &s;ay to her.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="190">
But &s;he ought to be a&s;ham'd to &s;peak to you, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> or hear you &s;peak to her, and much more that I &s;hou'd hear it: Be&s;ides, I have remov'd her out of your Reach, &s;o you may go about your Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Remove her where you will, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> I will &s;peak with her, do your wor&s;t, and have her too, if you ha'n't murther'd her.</P>
<P>How it came to pa&s;s, that the Daughter got &s;o much Liberty, he cou'd not tell; but, in the middle of all this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he got to a Window, on the Side of the Hou&s;e, and call'd aloud to <HI>William,</HI> and giving the Lye to her Father, <HI>as it were,</HI> told him, &s;he was not remov'd, nor wou'd not be remov'd; but &s;he wou'd find a Way quickly to come out, <HI>or to that Effect;</HI> and <HI>William</HI> an&s;wer'd her in &s;uch Terms, as made her Father fear they were married.</P>
<P>This was very provoking to her Father (you may be &s;ure) to have his Daughter give him the <HI>LYE,</HI> in that manner as &s;he did; and extorted &s;ome ra&s;h Words from him to the Fellow, and he (as much inflam'd) re|turn'd him very &s;currilous Language, in &s;o many Words, and bade him, <HI>Come out into the Yard, if he was not afraid to &s;hew his Face to an hone&s;t Man.</HI></P>
<P>The Colonel, a Man of Spirit, ran to his Clo&s;et, took a Fu&s;ee in his Hand, that was loaded with a Brace of Bullets, which he always kept &s;o loaded, in ca&s;e of Thieves, and boldly open'd the Door; but the Fellow,
<PB N="188" REF="191">
who was without the Gate, &s;eeing the Gun in his Hand, upbraided him with Cowar|dice, in bringing out Fire-Arms to a na|ked Man; but moving off, de&s;ir'd him to have Patience, and he wou'd wait upon him again, in a Condition fit to talk with him, notwith&s;tanding his Gun; &s;o in a Quarter of an Hour, he return'd with a Fu&s;ee in his Hand al&s;o.</P>
<P>But by this time, the Neighbours, alarm'd by &s;ome of the Colonel's Servants, inter|pos'd, and the Fray was ended for that time, without Mi&s;cheif: It is not material to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, how the Gentleman and his Daughter manag'd; he wou'd have &s;ent her into the Country, but the Girl wou'd not go; he knew not well where to put her, but that, if &s;he had a Mind to be mi&s;erable, and take the Fellow, &s;he might find Means to do it; &s;o he thought it fafe&s;t to keep her in his own Hou&s;e, where he thought his Anthority might prevent her De&s;igns, and his Rea&s;oning might (in time) prevail with her, to alter her Mind.</P>
<P>But about five Days after, the Fellow ha|ving found Means, by fla&s;hing of Gun Powder, and other Tokens agreed between them, to let her know, that he was ready, and &s;he having found Means to give him notice of her Re&s;o|lution, &s;he let her&s;elf down from the third Story, in the Night, and he, with two more, &s;tood ready to carry her off, at the Bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="192">
She was &s;afe at the Bottom, and had ju&s;t &s;et her Foot upon the Ground, when the Colonel hearing, or &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome Noi&s;e, &s;tarted up, run to the Window with his Gun in his Hand, and having ju&s;t Light enough to &s;ee his Daughter putting her&s;elf into the Arms of his Coachman, &s;hot him dead upon the Spot.</P>
<P>The Lady, frighted almo&s;t to Death, fell flat upon the Ground, and the Father be|lieving he had kill'd his own Daughter, was for a-while in a dreadful Agony, and run out to bring her in, but was better &s;a|tisfied, when he found &s;he was only frighted: It co&s;t the poor Gentleman a great-deal of Trouble and Affliction afterwards, and in a manner ruin'd the Family; for the Laws here are very nice in &s;uch Ca&s;es, where there appear'd a former Quarrel: But all this had its Beginning in the In&s;olence of the Servant; and &s;o far is to the purpo&s;e I am writing about, the re&s;t of the Story being too long to trouble you with now.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> You may note that on the Tryal it was effectually prov'd,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That at one a-Clock in the Morning (or thereabouts) three Men were &s;een in his Yard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That he &s;aw them carrying off his Daughter; <HI>which was nece&s;&s;arily con|&s;trued to be a Robbery.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="190" REF="193">
3. But &s;uppo&s;e not, it was allow'd to be an un&s;ea&s;onable Time of Night, and that the Gentleman not going out of his Hou&s;e, had a Right to defend his Hou&s;e, which he had Rea&s;on to believe was in Danger to be robb'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That he call'd out &s;everal times, <HI>Who's there;</HI> but was an&s;wer'd by one of them (not the Coachman) <HI>No-body;</HI> at which he gave notice that he wou'd fire, and bade them &s;tand off at their Peril: <HI>All which Particulars were, it &s;eems, effectually prov'd in his Favour.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>However, it was very unhappy to the Father, and afflicted him all his Days, to the la&s;t Degree; for the Blood of a Man (tho' a Villain in what he did) is very grievous, to a Mind &s;en&s;ible of the World, and of the Nature of killing a Fellow-Crea|ture, however faulty.</P>
<P>This Story I tell you in Confirmation of what I have &s;aid, namely, That the Provo|cations, given by Servants in this Country, are &s;uch, that 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible, that any Gentleman &s;hou'd bear them; and were it &s;o in <HI>France,</HI> I believe you will be of my Opinion, that there wou'd be 500 Footmen in a Year, &s;ent into another World by their Ma&s;ters own Hands; and I mu&s;t add my Opinion too in the other Part, <HI>namely,</HI> That it is becau&s;e Ma&s;ters in <HI>France</HI> will not bear
<PB N="191" REF="194">
&s;uch U&s;age from their Servants, that Servants in <HI>France</HI> behave after another manner.</P>
<P>I remember, when the In&s;olence of Ser|vants in <HI>France</HI> caus'd that happy Edict of our late Great Monarch, That no Servants, that is to &s;ay, no Footmen, or as we call 'em, Valets &s;hou'd wear Swords: But even this was occa&s;ion'd by their Rudene&s;s to other People, and &s;ometimes to one another; but it was &s;carce ever heard in <HI>France,</HI> that a Footman behav'd otherwi&s;e to his Ma&s;ter, than with the mo&s;t profound Submi&s;&s;ion; or that if they did, they always met with the &s;e|vere&s;t Correction.</P>
<P>The very Name of <HI>Footman</HI> intimates, That they are bred at the Foot of their Ma&s;ter; their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to clean his Shoes, and to be always ready at his Foot, that is to &s;ay, for the mo&s;t &s;ervile Employment; their Po&s;t is to go or ride behind, and they ought not to come into the Ma&s;ter's Pre&s;ence, but with Hat in Hand, bare-headed, and with all the Tokens of an entire Submi&s;&s;ion: This ever was the U&s;age, and is &s;till in our Coun|try, and ought to be in every Country: But I can a&s;&s;ure you, the Ca&s;e is quite alter'd in <HI>England,</HI> and tho' the Carriage of a Footman is &s;eemingly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, their real Behaviour is quite another thing than it was.</P>
<P>They are now drunken, &s;awcy, unman|nerly, negligent; not only above Correction, but even above Reproof; I &s;hall tell you
<PB N="192" REF="195">
afterwards what cau&s;es it; I am now upon the Fact, and letting you know that it really is &s;o.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of my particular Acquain|tance, having Occa&s;ion to be in <HI>Scotland,</HI> thought it a good Place to get a Servant in, his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Servant, that he carried down with him, was not able, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> to live as Servants liv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;o he de|&s;ir'd to be di&s;mi&s;s'd, which was granted; he had after that a Fellow recommended to him, that had a great De&s;ire to &s;erve an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, for he had heard much what good Ma&s;ters they were, and how well they us'd their Setvants; upon this the Gentleman &s;ent for him.</P>
<P>The Fellow &s;eem'd to have the Face of a good Servant, far from being unacquaint|ed with the lowe&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion; and when they talk'd of going to <HI>England,</HI> he told my Friend, That if his Honour pleas'd to carry him to <HI>England,</HI> he wou'd run at his Hor&s;e Foot all the Way, for he &s;hou'd not need to buy a Hor&s;e for him: Now my Friend thought indeed that he had been fitted; he had Occa&s;ion to travel &s;ome &s;hort Journeys, while he remain'd there, being employ'd in publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and his new Man was the mo&s;t tendible Servant, that ever Gentleman cou'd de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter generous, like an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, and kind, cou'd not bear to &s;ee the poor Fellow run on Foot, up Hill and

down-Hill, over the Mountains, thro' the Rivers, in the colde&s;t Weather as well as in the hotte&s;t, while his other Servants had Hor&s;es always to ride on; &s;o (with|out his Man's Sollicitation) he furni&s;h'd him&s;elf with another Hor&s;e, for his new Valet, and mighty thankful the Fellow was.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, among whom my Friend convers'd, and to whom <HI>Harry</HI> (that was his Name) was frequently &s;ent of Errands, and on Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Con&s;equence, &s;hew'd their Re&s;pect for his Ma&s;ter, by being very bountiful to his Servant; &s;o that <HI>Harry</HI> began to feel Money ring in his Pocket, which had never been his Ca&s;e before.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Con&s;equence of this was, that <HI>Harry</HI> threw away his Bonnet, which was all the Covering his Brains had ever known in <HI>Aberdeen&s;hire</HI> (from thence he came,) and bought him&s;elf a good Ca&s;tor <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hat.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter had promis'd him his Livery, when he came to <HI>England,</HI> but was not wil|ling to have it made there, for many Rea|&s;ons; but having Occa&s;ion to &s;tay &s;ome Months longer in <HI>Scotland</HI> than he expect|ed, <HI>Harry</HI> found Ways and Means, by the &s;ame Bounty of the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen, to buy an old (or &s;econd-hand) black Coat, which, his Ma&s;ter being at that Time in Mourning, was &s;uitable enough, and <HI>Harry</HI> began to call him&s;elf his Ma&s;ter's Gentleman.</P>
<P>It was not long, before his Ma&s;ter had Oc|ca&s;ion to &s;end <HI>Harry</HI> from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to
<PB N="194" REF="197">
<HI>Queen's-Ferry,</HI> upon Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;e|quence; and his Hor&s;es and other Servants, being gone to <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> on &s;ome other Oc|ca&s;ion, <HI>Harry</HI> was oblig'd to go on Foot, at which he &s;hew'd a vi&s;ible Reluctance; at length, when his Ma&s;ter told him it mu&s;t be &s;o, he &s;aid, <HI>loud enough to be heard,</HI> it was a little over-far to gang on his Foot.</P>
<P>Well, his Ma&s;ter took no Notice of it, at that time, but <HI>Harry</HI> went the long Journey, and came back the &s;ame Day; but at Night, when his Ma&s;ter wanted <HI>Harry</HI> for &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s (I know not what) truly he was gone to his Bed; and the next Morning his Ma&s;ter had two or three lit|tle Rubbs of his great Wearine&s;s; upon which, a Day or two after, he call'd his Man <HI>Harry,</HI> and, with good Humour in his Face, ask'd him, if his Wearine&s;s was over? <HI>Harry</HI> &s;aid, Yes, but that indeed it was a hard Journey: Why, <HI>Harry, &s;aid his Ma&s;ter,</HI> did not you offer to run at my Hor&s;e-Foot to <HI>England,</HI> when I hir'd you.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> wou'd &s;ain have forgot, that he had &s;aid &s;o; but his Ma&s;ter reminded him of the Particulars in &s;o plain a manner, that he cou'd not deny it; but he came off with &s;ay|ing, He was always willing to &s;erve his Honour, <HI>&s;o all Servants call their Ma&s;ters there,</HI> but he found he was willinger than able.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>Harry, &s;aid his Ma&s;ter,</HI> not le&s;s able, but a little le&s;s humble (I doubt) than you
<PB N="195" REF="198">
were; you and I mu&s;t talk about that, <HI>Harry;</HI> pray get you another Ma&s;ter: Yes, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Harry, without any He&s;itation,</HI> and away he went.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Harry</HI> bethought him&s;elf, and made Friends to be continued in his Ser|vice, and that he might go to <HI>England,</HI> for that was all he de&s;ir'd it &s;eems, when he came fir&s;t; upon this Submi&s;&s;ion <HI>Harry</HI> was receiv'd again into Favour, and came to <HI>En|gland</HI> with his Ma&s;ter; when he had been in <HI>England</HI> a little while, he grew like the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Servants, &s;awcy and proud; but with this Addition to it, that he did not like the Wages his Ma&s;ter gave him, but he under|&s;tood, that other Servants in <HI>England</HI> got more Wages than he did, and he wanted more Wages: Well, his Ma&s;ter, being wil|ling to have kept the Fellow, con&s;ented to give him 40<HI>s.</HI> a Year more Wages, than he had agreed with him for before.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that <HI>Harry</HI> did &s;omething wrong, that his Ma&s;ter had &s;et him about, and it being &s;omething of Bu&s;ine&s;s, which being wrong done, was &s;ome Di&s;appointment to his Ma&s;ter; he was a little angry, and took <HI>Harry</HI> up &s;hort, but gave him not one hard Name, or any thing of that Kind; <HI>Harry</HI> told him impudently, He did not under|&s;tand &s;uch Language, that he had not been us'd to be &s;o talk'd to, in that manner; and a great many Words he made of it.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="199">
Some time after, <HI>Harry</HI> took Occa&s;ion to let fall &s;ome in&s;olent Words among the Servants, as that he wou'd not be talk'd to by any Ma&s;ter in <HI>Britain;</HI> that his Relati|ons were Men of honourable Families, and he was a Gentleman, tho' he &s;erv'd his Ma&s;ter &s;o-and-&s;o.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter heard of this, but took no no|tice of it; but, &s;ome time after, <HI>Harry</HI> had done another Fault, and it was a Fault, that in|deed in a Servant is intollerable; that when &s;ome Gentlemen had been to &s;peak with his Ma&s;ter, who was abroad, and had left Word with <HI>Harry,</HI> that they had been there, and told their Names, <HI>Harry</HI> took no care to let his Ma&s;ter know any thing of it.</P>
<P>When his Ma&s;ter came to hear of it, he was very much provok'd, as indeed he had Rea&s;on, and calling up his Man, he exa|min'd him, if &s;uch Gentlemen had not been there, at &s;uch a time? <HI>Harry</HI> own'd they had been there, and left their Names too: Well, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> and what was the Rea&s;on that you did not give me an Ac|count of it, when I came home: <HI>Harry</HI> an|&s;wer'd fir&s;t, that he thought he had told him: <HI>His Ma&s;ter alledg'd,</HI> That cou'd not be, for then he &s;hou'd not have forgot to own it to the Gentlemen, that Bu&s;ine&s;s be|ing of Con&s;equence to him&s;elf: Then <HI>Harry</HI> wou'd have &s;aid he forgot it; this made his Ma&s;ter doubly angry: Why, then, did you not, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;et it down in
<PB N="197" REF="200">
the Book? It &s;eems, his Ma&s;ter had given him a Minute-Book, and Pen and Ink, on purpo&s;e to &s;et down &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s as might happen in his Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Truly, <HI>Harry,</HI> being driven to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of owning a Fault, which if he had done, there had been an End of it, grew &s;awcy, and after grumbling and muttering to him&s;elf a-while, and his Ma&s;ter asking what he &s;aid, <HI>he told him, in &s;o many Words,</HI> that truly he did not give him&s;elf much Trou|ble to remember &s;uch Things.</P>
<P>What do you mean by that, Sir, <HI>&s;ay his Ma&s;ter?</HI> Is it not my Bu&s;ine&s;s? Are you a Servant, or are you not? <HI>Harry replied,</HI> tho' he was a Servant, he was not to be talk'd in that manner to, as he had been, and he &s;hou'd not trouble him&s;elf with Men's Bu&s;ine&s;s, that us'd him &s;o.</P>
<P>Blame him not, if the Gentleman was in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion at this; but he turn'd &s;hort upon him with a Smile; What, <HI>Harry,</HI> do you bear Malice? 'Tis above a Month &s;ince I &s;poke to your Wor&s;hip in the manner you talk of, and I am &s;ure you de&s;erv'd it; and if any had Occa&s;ion to remember it, I &s;hou'd, for you were impudent enough, and do you pretend to bear it in Mind now? <HI>Yes,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>he did, and he wou'd never forgive any Man, that &s;hou'd talk to him in that manner:</HI> Why then, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> I am &s;orry I had not can'd you then, and kick'd you out of Doors, for a Ra&s;cal, as you de&s;erv'd; then
<PB N="198" REF="201">
you had had &s;omething to remember, and bear Malice for.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had not much to &s;ay then, but &s;till kept grumbling; at length &s;ays his Ma&s;ter, It &s;eems, I had di&s;oblig'd you before, <HI>Harry,</HI> and &s;o you neglected my Bu&s;ine&s;s now on purpo&s;e to be even with me, was that the Ca&s;e? Indeed, <HI>&s;ays Harry,</HI> &s;omething of that Kind, for I do not under&s;tand &s;uch Treat|ment as this: With that, his Ma&s;ter had indeed no more Patience, but flew at him, and giving him a good Kick on the Back|&s;ide, took up his Cane to have broke his Head, being provok'd at his Ingratitude; <HI>You ungrateful Dog,</HI> &s;ays he, did I take you to run at my Hor&s;e Foot, and can you talk thus to me; and with that, I &s;ay, flew to his Cane.</P>
<P>But <HI>Harry</HI> was as nimble as he, and tho' he was as &s;awcy as <HI>Edward,</HI> yet he had not <HI>Edward</HI>'s Courage, but fled out of Doors, and walk'd off for that Night, and &s;taid two or three Days, 'till he thought his Ma&s;ter's Pa&s;&s;ion was over, and then he came again, and &s;ent in another of the Servants, to tell his Ma&s;ter, he was come to ask his Pardon.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter was ea&s;y enough to forgive him, but order'd his Clerk to pay him his Wages, and di&s;mi&s;s him, which was done; but there was another thing &s;till at the End of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Submi&s;&s;ion, and that was, he did not de&s;ign coming back to his Duty, and
<PB N="199" REF="202">
Service, for the Time was not up that he was hir'd for, but he was told by his Coun|try-men, that he might have more Wages; and he &s;tudied to di&s;oblige his Ma&s;ter, that he might be turn'd off; but &s;till he wanted a Certificate, this is what we call (in <HI>France</HI>) a Te&s;timonial of Fidelity and good Behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>His Ma&s;ter told him,</HI> Ay, he wou'd give him a Certificate, &s;uch as he de&s;erv'd: Why, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Harry, in his Country Tone,</HI> Have I not been hone&s;t and ju&s;t? Yes, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> but thou ha&s;t been &s;awcy and im|pudent too: Well but, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Harry,</HI> and you'll certify to my Hone&s;ty; you have for|given me the re&s;t; plea&s;e to certify the fir&s;t Part.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> tho' I have forgi|given your Behaviour, <HI>Harry,</HI> I cannot cer|tify, that you did not misbehave: E'en cer|tify what you like, Sir, <HI>&s;ays Harry,</HI> and was very humble; for <HI>Harry</HI> found, that he cou'd not get a Place, without a Certificate; and his Ma&s;ter perceiv'd it, and was wil|ling to humble him, &s;o he wrote a Certificate thus, <Q>I &mdash; &mdash; do hereby certify, That <HI>Harry D&mdash;,</HI> the Bearer, &s;erv'd me three Quarters of a Year, having been hir'd for a Year; that he was hone&s;t in what Matters of Tru&s;t I committed to him, but di&s;mi&s;s'd by me for his in&s;olent Be|haviour,
<PB N="200" REF="203">
and &s;awcy Language. Witne&s;s my Hand, the 10th Day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1707.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> heard the Contents of this with a &s;taring Countenance, and an inexpre&s;&s;ible Surprize (for his Ma&s;ter read it to him) and when he had done, only &s;aid, <HI>Is that the Certificate you will plea&s;e to give me?</HI> And without waiting for an An&s;wer, turn'd his Back, and went off: However, <HI>Harry,</HI> like a true Villain, that cou'd fawn 'till his Purpo&s;e was &s;erv'd, and be impudent again when it was &s;erv'd; I &s;ay, <HI>Harry</HI> made Friends to the Gentleman's Lady, and &s;he interceeded for him to his Ma&s;ter; and con&s;idering it might be the poor Fellow's Ruin, at la&s;t he gave him a Certificate.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time after this, that <HI>Harry</HI> being dre&s;s'd mighty fine, comes to the Gentle|man's Hou&s;e, and his Ma&s;ter being not at home, &s;ent in his Name to his Lady: The Lady was &s;ome-how or other engag'd, but bade one of the Servants tell him, his Ma|&s;ter was not at home; &s;he cou'd not ima|gine indeed, the Gentleman had any Bu&s;ine&s;s with her, unle&s;s it had been to thank her for her Interce&s;&s;ion; but &s;he order'd the Servants, to have him into the Kitchin, and make him eat and drink; &s;o he went away; but about three or four Days after, &s;ends a &s;awcy impudent Letter to the Lady her|&s;elf, full of fooli&s;h (but rude) Language, becau&s;e &s;he was pleas'd to order her Servants
<PB N="201" REF="204">
to entertain him, but did not wait upon him her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Gentleman, I mention'd above, had the Exerci&s;e of &s;everal &s;uch Servants as the&s;e, and &s;ome wor&s;e; one of the princi|pal Rea&s;ons, that I can a&s;&s;ign for it, was, that if the general Character of the Gen|tleman was ju&s;t, he was only the kinde&s;t, and mo&s;t con&s;idering Ma&s;ter imaginable to his Servants; always compa&s;&s;ionate of them, ea&s;y with them, doing good to them, making their Lives ea&s;y, and their Service plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t now give you an Example, where this Evil has prov'd tragical, both to Ma&s;ter and Servant; for as I hinted before, that the Provocations, given by Servants, are un&s;ufferable, and that it is not always ea&s;y for Gentlemen, to govern their Pa&s;&s;ions in &s;uch Ca&s;es; &s;o you may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that all Gentlemen have not the &s;ame Govern|ment of them&s;elves; Men are not equally patient, nor equally Philo&s;ophers; and &s;ome Examples may be given, where this in&s;olent Behaviour of Servants has provok'd Ma&s;ters beyond their Patience.</P>
<P>There was a Country Gentleman of a very good E&s;tate, but being a &s;ingle Man, (&s;o they call Men here, that are not married) and having no Family, he liv'd privately, and only kept two Servants; one was a Groom, the other a kind of Gentleman to him, that is to &s;ay, one that always attended his
<PB N="202" REF="205">
Ma&s;ter, dre&s;s'd him, and travell'd with him, and at other times was a kind of Stew|ard to him, did Bu&s;ine&s;s for him, Re|ceiv'd his Rents, paid Money for him, and was tru&s;ted by him to a very con&s;iderable Degree; and as he had always appear'd to be very hone&s;t, and his Ma&s;ter none of the be&s;t Managers, he rather too much de|pended upon this Servant, and &s;eldom took any regular Account of his Behaviour, but left all to him.</P>
<P>Time and good U&s;age had the u&s;ual Ef|fect upon this Servant, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> that as the Cu&s;tom of mo&s;t Servants is in this Coun|try, that they &s;oon get out of the Know|ledge of them&s;elves, they take all the Kind|ne&s;s of their Ma&s;ters to be not a Favour, but a Debt to their extraordinary Merit; this Fancy of extraordinary Merit &s;wells them with extraordinary Pride; and from that Time they neither know how to be|have to Fellow-Servants, or to Ma&s;ters them|&s;elves: So it was here; and fir&s;t this Fel|low began to mend his Figure, get a long Wig, ride with a Sword, wear a Watch in his Pocket, and the like: In con&s;equence of this, he look'd upon him&s;elf to be above the Rank of an ordinary Servant, and at length, by his particular Intere&s;t with his Ma&s;ter, obtain'd to throw off his Livery, and dre&s;s as a Gentleman.</P>
<P>From one Step to another, Pride knows no Bounds, fir&s;t he learnt to in&s;ult over his
<PB N="203" REF="206">
Fellow Servant, and in a little time more be|gan to bri&s;tle up, even to his Ma&s;ter him&s;elf; and that in Spight of innumerable Favours, Benefactions, and Civilities; which he had receiv'd from a Gentleman, who, however he was warm and pa&s;&s;ionate in extraordina|ry Ca&s;es, was yet to him the be&s;t-humour'd Gentleman living.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter, who had &s;hew'd him by a thou&s;and Tokens, that he had an ex|traordinary Re&s;pect for him, cou'd not yet bear to have him grow upon him, and was very nice in taking notice of it, did many Ways check, and take him &s;hort in the Be|ginning of his new Behaviour, and &s;ome|times talk'd roundly to him about it; but it was all-one, he grew the more pert, and &s;hort with his Ma&s;ter, 'till in Time, the Evil growing upon him, and he became down-right &s;awcy on many Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I cannot but ob&s;erve here, for the Cau|tion of all Gentlemen, on the like Occa&s;i|ons, that they &s;hou'd (if po&s;&s;ible) avoid &s;uch common catch-word Sayings, as have any thing ominous in them upon them&s;elves: This Gentleman, in reproving his Steward, <HI>as I may call him,</HI> us'd this extraordinary Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, almo&s;t upon all Occa&s;ions, Prithee <HI>Humphry,</HI> don't be &s;awcy; I can't bear your in|&s;olent Tongue; <HI>I'll kill you,</HI> you Dog, if you talk &s;o to me, I tell you, <HI>I'll kill you;</HI> this he often &s;aid in Je&s;t, after he had us'd it pretty much; if he &s;ent him for Money to his
<PB N="204" REF="207">
Tennants, he wou'd add je&s;tingly, Go, and get me &s;ome Money, <HI>I'll kill you,</HI> you Dog, if you don't bring me &s;ome Money; and the like, upon many other Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of this unhappy Gentle|tleman's Misfortunes, this was one, <HI>viz.</HI> That he drank very hard, and &s;ometimes this impudent Fellow wou'd take upon him to reprove his Ma&s;ter for it, and that not in a mode&s;t way, as a cautioning him of the Mi&s;chief of it, which he had good Humour enough to have taken very kindly; but he wou'd laugh at him, ridicule, and expo&s;e his Ma&s;ter, rather than mode&s;tly cover his Infir|mity; and upon his Ma&s;ter's being acquaint|ed with this, one time, after he had been a little in Drink, he calls his Man to him, and upbraided him with it; but he gave him &s;awcy Language, which was the Occa&s;ion of the fir&s;t Breach between them, for his Ma&s;ter told him in few Words, he did not de&s;erve the Favours he had &s;hewn him, and &s;o in &s;hort, turn'd him off.</P>
<P>However, in a few Days, the Fellow be|gan to be &s;en&s;ible of his Lo&s;s, and went to his Ma&s;ter, ask'd him Pardon, and was, with an Abundance of good Nature, receiv'd into his Place again, and in as much Favour as ever.</P>
<P>By that time he had been in Place again, long enough to forget the Favour, and to forget the Sen&s;e he had had of it before, he be|came
<PB N="205" REF="208">
ju&s;t as &s;awcy and in&s;olent as he was before.</P>
<P>It happen'd, one Night, that his Ma&s;ter &s;tay'd out very late, and his Gentleman &s;it|ting up for him, was very finely gotten fa&s;t a&s;leep, in his Ma&s;ter's Parlour, and in his ea&s;y Chair, by the Fire: About four a-Clock in the Morning, his Ma&s;ter rung at the Door; and the Groom, or Footman, comes running into the Parlour, to call the Stew|ard, believing he might be a&s;leep; and he was indeed &s;o dead a&s;leep, that he cou'd not be pre&s;ently wak'd; &s;o that while the Foot|man was waking him, his Ma&s;ter was at his Heels, and was come into the Parlour him|&s;elf: The Dialogue between the Groom and the Steward was very &s;hort, but being much to the Purpo&s;e, 'tis very needful to give you the Particulars of it, <HI>as follows.</HI></P>

<P>O, O, Is he come? Is the old Dog come then? D&mdash; him, 'tis very well

indeed; a fine Time of Night, D&mdash; him; a fine Time, truly: I &s;uppo&s;e, the old Rogue is drunk enough; pray, who brought him home?</P>
</SP>
<P>All the while the Sot &s;aid this la&s;t Part, his Ma&s;ter &s;tood, and heard every Word of it, for he was come in within the Parlour-Door; &s;o when he had done, his Ma&s;ter be|gan: O, Mr. <HI>Humphry, &s;ays he,</HI> what, are you got drunk before me to Night? And &s;poke it merrily enough; for it happen'd, to Mr. <HI>Humphry</HI>'s Misfortune, that his Ma&s;ter was not drunk that Night; or at mo&s;t, not &s;o drunk as he u&s;ually was, &s;o that he had Temper enough to manage his Gentleman Mr. <HI>Humphry,</HI> pretty well; for he caus'd him to give up all his Tru&s;ts and Books, which he u&s;ually kept, that very Night, and turn'd him out of Doors the next Morning.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Humphry</HI> wou'd fain have &s;taid next Morning, and gave his Ma&s;ter very good Words; but it wou'd not do; his Ma&s;ter was warmer then, by a great deal, than he was over-night: No, no, <HI>Humphry, &s;ays he,</HI> you and I mu&s;t part; I can't bear &s;uch as this; <HI>adding,</HI> I &s;hall certainly <HI>kill you,</HI> one time or other, if you &s;tay, therefore get you gone, I &s;ay, or I am &s;ure I &s;hall <HI>kill you:</HI> So Mr. <HI>Humphry</HI> was oblig'd to pack up, and be gone.</P>
<P>Well, notwith&s;tanding all this abominable Treatment, Mr. <HI>Humphry,</HI> upon an Acknow|ledgment of his Fault, and the Interce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="207" REF="210">
of &s;ome Friends, which he got to &s;peak to his Ma&s;ter in his Favour, was taken in again a third time, about half a Year after, and was re-in&s;tated in the &s;ame Place as be|fore.</P>
<P>He had, upon his Application to his Ma&s;ter to be re&s;tor'd, humbled him&s;elf ve|ry much, acknowledg'd that he was in Drink, and knew not what he &s;aid; and asking Pardon, had a&s;&s;ur'd his Ma&s;ter of his future good Behaviour, and for &s;ome time he was a tollerable good Servant.</P>
<P>But there is no changing of Nature: Mr. <HI>Humphry</HI> &s;oon forgot the <HI>Ea&s;y Chair,</HI> and the Story of calling his Ma&s;ter hard Names, as above; and grew ju&s;t the &s;ame individual <HI>Mr. Humphry</HI> as he was before; and in particular, as &s;awcy to his Ma&s;ter, upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions: It happen'd one Night, that his Ma&s;ter got &s;o very drunk, at a neighbouring Gentleman's Hou&s;e, that he cou'd not get home, but as he was ri|ding homewards, fell off from his Hor&s;e; but it being in a Country Village where he was known, the People at an Inn, took him up, and &s;ent to his Hou&s;e, for his Ser|vants to come and fetch him.</P>
<P>He kept no Coach, nor he cou'd not fit on Hor&s;e-back; &s;o his two Men thought them&s;elves oblig'd to carry him home in a Chair (it being near two Miles off) and that, not a Chair (as we call it) &s;uch as
<PB N="208" REF="211">
ply in the Streets of <HI>London,</HI> but a meet plain Country Chair; when they were ju&s;t coming out of the Inn, comes up Mr. <HI>Hum|phry,</HI> and he falls upon his Ma&s;ter, with a thou&s;and in&s;olent Reproaches; calling him <HI>Drunken old Rogue,</HI> and the like; and in a Word, made the two Men &s;et him down, and get a Cart to carry him home in.</P>
<P>Every-body cry'd out again&s;t Mr. <HI>Hum|phry,</HI> for offering &s;uch an Affront to his Ma&s;ter; told him it was a Shame, and the like: But his Ma&s;ter, that cou'd ju&s;t &s;peak, and that was all, call'd out, that he wou'd have the Cart, ay, he wou'd have the Cart; <HI>Humphry,</HI> you Dog, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> bring the Cart, I will have the Cart, I tell you; <HI>and at la&s;t adds,</HI> I'll kill you, you Dog, if you don't give me the Cart: This made the Country People quiet; and &s;o Mr. <HI>Humphry</HI> (like him|&s;elf) put his Ma&s;ter into the Cart, and carried him home.</P>
<P>The next Day, when his Ma&s;ter was &s;o|ber, and come to know, how he had been us'd by his Man, he conceiv'd &s;uch an ir|reconcileable Grudge again&s;t him, as was ne|ver to be wip'd off, and was at la&s;t fatal to them both.</P>
<P>That Part of the Story is tragical, and wou'd be too long for a Letter; neither is it to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e: But the &s;hort of it is this, that this unhappy Gentleman be|ing another time a little in Drink, and <HI>Humphry</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="212">
giving him &s;ome provoking Language one Night, as they were going home from a Ta|vern, his Ma&s;ter (in a Pa&s;&s;ion) run him into the Body, and laid him dead at his Foot; for which he was try'd at the Country A&s;&s;I|zes, and the old Grudge being prov'd, the Jury brought him in guilty of wilful Mur|der, and it co&s;t him his Life.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Told you, at my Beginning to write on this flagrant Subject, I did not intend to trouble you with an Ac|count of the Di&s;hone&s;ty, the thie|ving, and whoring among Servants, for that the&s;e had been frequent, not only in all Ages, but in all Nations: There have always been Thieves and Whores, who get into Peo|ples Hou&s;es, under the Characters of hone&s;t Servants, even with De&s;ign to rob the Fami|lies, <HI>and the like;</HI> and to talk of the&s;e wou'd be, to &s;ay nothing new; yet you mu&s;t allow me to ob&s;erve, that there were never &s;o ma|ny &s;uch as now. I have been told, our famous Thief-taker (as they call him) has a Li&s;t of 7000 <HI>Newgate-</HI>Birds, now in Services in this City, and Parts adjacent, all with Intent to rob the Hou&s;es they are in; and the Rea&s;on of this I hinted at in one of my la&s;t, namely, that it is certainly encreas'd by the Pride and In&s;o|lence, which Servants in general are now ar|riv'd to; for that (as I &s;aid then) when once Servants are brought to contemn the Per&s;ons and Authority of their Ma&s;ters, or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, or Employers, they &s;oon come to de&s;pi&s;e their
<PB N="211" REF="214">
Intere&s;ts; and at la&s;t to break into their Proper|ty; and thus they become Thieves, in a man|ner in&s;en&s;ible, and by the meer Con&s;equence of the Thing.</P>
<P>But I am now to de&s;cribe to you, that Sort of Thieving and Robbery, which is practis'd by tho&s;e we call hone&s;t Servants in <HI>England,</HI> or at lea&s;t, by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves <HI>ho|ne&s;t;</HI> and who, as I &s;aid in my La&s;t, wou'd think them&s;elves very much affronted, if they &s;hou'd be call'd di&s;hone&s;t, or be deny'd Te&s;ti|monials of their Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is Lo&s;s of Time: If I hire a Ser|vant, or a Workman, by the Day, or by the Week; the Meaning of the Agreement is, that my Money is their Due, when the Hours, which they were to work, are expir'd; and their Time is my Due, if they expect their Wages: He that defrauds me of any Part of the Time that he makes me pay for, is as much a Thief, as if he broke open my Cabi|net, and took away &s;o much Money, as tho&s;e Hours (&s;o wa&s;ted) came to: This is certainly ju&s;t, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;wade any Ser|vant of this, and they &s;o little value it, as a Di&s;hone&s;ty, that (generally &s;peaking) they &s;corn to acknowledge it, either to God or Man.</P>
<P>A Friend of mine, in the Country, had a warm Scuffle with one of the&s;e hone&s;t Ser|vants, upon this Foot, a few Months ago: He had order'd his Gardener, in particular, to make a Hot-bed, for the rai&s;ing &s;ome nice
<PB N="212" REF="215">
Plants, which he (being curious that way) took great Delight in, and had a Value for: The Fellow took his Orders, and went out into the Garden, as if he went to make the Hot-bed; but it happen'd, that in a Field, ju&s;t without his Garden-Wall, there was &s;ome young Fellows playing at Cricket, a Sport which the Country People, in this Part of <HI>En|gland,</HI> very much delight in.</P>
<P>Three times the Gentleman went down in|to his Garden, to &s;ee what Progre&s;s his Gar|dener had made in the Hot-bed; at the fir&s;t time he found him at the Work, having made a Beginning, which was as much as he cou'd expect for the Time that he had been about it: The &s;econd time he went down, which was two or three Hours after, and found he had not done one Stroke towards it, more than he had done at fir&s;t, and that he was not at the Work; whereupon calling him, he found he was at the Back-door of the Garden, look|ing out into the Field: As &s;oon as he heard his Ma&s;ter call him, he came in, fell to the Work, told him, that he was but ju&s;t &s;tept to the Door, from the Work, that Minute; which, tho' it was fal&s;e, yet pa&s;s'd well enough, and my Friend &s;aid little to him at that time; nor did he know any-thing of the attractive Sport that was in the Field, which occa&s;ion'd his Gardener's idle Humour at that time; but &s;eeing him fall to work hard while he &s;taid, he left him again for two or three Hours more, and then comes again, to look at the Work;
<PB N="213" REF="216">
but, in&s;tead of the Work going on, his Gar|dener was at the &s;ame Sport, and at the &s;ame Garden-Door as before, only that being pret|ty &s;harp in looking out for his Ma&s;ter, he was &s;o nimble as to &s;hut the Garden Back|door, and &s;culk behind &s;ome fine trim'd Hedg|es, that &s;tood convenient for his Purpo&s;e, and &s;o get to the Hot-bed before his Ma&s;ter; but as Eyes are quicker than Feet, his Ma&s;ter happen'd to &s;ee him, tho' he thought he had not.</P>
<P>As the Gardener thought he had not been &s;een, &s;o his Ma&s;ter did not let him know, <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> that he had &s;een him; but when he came to the Hot-bed, and found little or no|thing done, more than was done when he left him before, he que&s;tion'd him (tho' calmly) what was the Meaning that his Orders had not been executed, and the Hot-bed made? he knowing that the Plants he had to &s;et in it, had lain out of the Ground all the while, and wou'd be in Danger of &s;poiling: <HI>The Fel|low &s;aid,</HI> He had work'd very hard at it, and done what he cou'd, and he cou'd do no more than he had done, in that Time, <HI>and the like;</HI> grumbling a little, as if he was not ju&s;tly blam'd.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter, &s;till concealing that he knew any-thing of what was the Ca&s;e, argued with him a-while how little was done, <HI>and told him,</HI> that if an Hour's Work or two in a Day had been mi&s;&s;ing, he might indeed not have been able to perceive it, or at lea&s;t, his Gardener
<PB N="214" REF="217">
might pretend to impo&s;e upon him; but when, in&s;tead of mi&s;&s;ing an Hour or two's Work in a Day, there was not an Hour's Work done in the Day, he cou'd not be de|ceiv'd &s;o much; and that he expected, when he order'd a Thing to be done, it &s;hou'd be di&s;patch'd, and not the Time &s;pent at Back|doors, and chatting with Companions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This was enough to make a Fellow, who had Manners little enough without it, to be &s;urly, and (perhaps) &s;awcy: However, he began a little low at fir&s;t, told his Ma&s;ter, he work'd as hard as he cou'd, and he (<HI>his Ma&s;ter</HI>) was never &s;atisfied; that he cou'd not work harder, <HI>not he,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may work hard, when you are at it, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> and, perhaps, you may work as hard as you can; but then you can't &s;ay, you have work'd as long as you can too, or as long as you ought: I was only out at the Back-door two Minutes in the Morning, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> no Ma&s;ter in <HI>England</HI> wou'd make &s;o many Words about &s;uch a Trifle, and I am &s;ure I have &s;etch'd it up &s;ince: The Ma&s;ter &s;mil'd at him, and &s;aid nothing for a-while; but finding him &s;till grow hot and &s;awcy, <HI>he told him,</HI> that in Pity to him, and to pre|vent his telling more Lyes, he wou'd let him know, that he found him the &s;econd time at the Garden-Door, and told him, how long he had been there, and how he &s;lunk in, and which way he went round to the <HI>Hot-bed,</HI> to avoid his &s;eeing him.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="218">
In&s;tead of mode&s;tly acknowledging his Fault, and asking his Ma&s;ter's Pardon, <HI>he told him,</HI> he had little to do indeed, to watch a poor Servant, that he cou'd not &s;tir to &s;peak to a Friend, but he mu&s;t be at his Heels; that he was a Servant, but wou'd not be a Slave; that he knew how to do his Work, as well as another, without being watch'd: And thus the Fellow run on impudentiy, as if his Ma&s;ter had injur'd him, in the highe&s;t Degree, by di&s;covering him: However, his Ma&s;ter commanded his Pa&s;&s;ion all this while, but when he &s;aid, he knew how to do his Work well enough without being watch'd, his Ma|&s;ter took him up, as if with a kind of a Je&s;t too; <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays his Ma&s;ter, <HI>but you know, 'tis natural to watch a THIEF.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Thief!</HI> Says the Gardener, <HI>a Thief!</HI> And repeating it &s;everal times, flew into, not a Pa&s;&s;ion of Sawcine&s;s, but even a Rage; told his Ma&s;ter, he was as hone&s;t a Man as him|&s;elf; that he &s;corn'd a Ma&s;ter that &s;hou'd call him <HI>a Thief,</HI> and he wou'd not take it from the be&s;t Ma&s;ter that evet kept a Servant; he had robb'd him of nothing, and was no Thief, and wou'd not be call'd &s;o, and he wou'd make him prove it, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>Well, hold, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> don't be &s;o hot; if you put me to prove it, I do in&s;i&s;t upon it, and I &s;hall not only prove it, but puni&s;h you for it too; I &s;ay, you have robb'd me of the Time which I pay you for, not only to Day, but many Days; and that Servant, that robs
<PB N="216" REF="219">
me of my Time, and of his Work in the time that I hire him for, robs me of my Mo|ney, and is as much a Thief, as if he &s;tole my Money out of my Hou&s;e, or out of my Pocket.</P>
<P>O dear! <HI>&s;ays the Gardener,</HI> is that your Thieving you charge me with? Will you make a Man a <HI>Thief</HI> for that? I think, and know my&s;elf to be as hone&s;t a Man as any in <HI>England</HI> for all that: Why, hark you, Sir, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> do I pay you your Wages, or do I not? Well, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he did not deny but he had his Wages: And what do I give you Wages for, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter?</HI></P>
<P>Why, for my Work, <HI>&s;ays the Gardener.</HI></P>
<P>And what if you do not work, <HI>&s;ays his Ma|&s;ter,</HI> and yet take my Money as if you did, as is the Ca&s;e to Day?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he did not &s;ay, but it was wrong to take his Money, and not do his Work, but he did not do &s;o.</P>
<P>Prithee, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> don't tell me of its being wrong, and &s;uch Stuff as that, I tell thee, 'tis <HI>Thieving,</HI> and neither better nor wor&s;e; and when you tell me a Lye, and tell me you have been at work, when I know you have been at the Alehou&s;e, and out of your Bu&s;ine&s;s, and by that Cheat you take my Mo|ney, as if you had been at work; I &s;ay, that is robbing me, and when you do &s;o, you are <HI>a Thief;</HI> there's no mincing the Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="220">
Well, this Word <HI>Thief</HI> ran &s;o in his Head, and &s;tuck &s;o in his Stomach, that notwith|&s;tanding his Ma&s;ter talk'd all this very calm|ly to him, yet his Blood was fir'd with it, and he cou'd not work; but, as &s;oon as his Ma&s;ter's Back was turn'd, he &s;tuck up his Spade, and his Fork in the Ground, and away he goes out, at the Back-door, to the Alehou&s;e; gets very drunk, and came not home, 'till about one a-Clock in the Morn|ing; when being, by his Ma&s;ter's Order, &s;hut out, he went back, and lodg'd as he cou'd; and in the Morning, when he came again, his Ma&s;ter order'd his other Servants, to tell him at the Door, that his Ma&s;ter had no more Bu&s;ine&s;s for him.</P>
<P>He made many Attempts, and got &s;everal Per&s;ons to interceed for him, for he had a very good Place of it; but his Ma&s;ter was inflexible; &s;o he came for his Tools, had his Wages, and was di&s;mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>When he was going away, he told his Ma|&s;ter, that as he had &s;erv'd him &s;o long, and had never differ'd with him before, he hop'd he wou'd give him a Certificate: I &s;hall ex|plain what is meant here by a Certificate hereafter, when I come to that Part.</P>
<P>A Certificate, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter!</HI> Yes, I'll give thee a Certificate, if thou de&s;ire&s;t it.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;ays the Gardener,</HI> I de&s;ire it, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> I believe thou had'&s;t better take no Certificate; you know, <HI>added</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="221">
<HI>his Ma&s;ter,</HI> you &s;aid you cou'd have Places enough.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Gardener,</HI> but I hope you won't &s;cruple &s;uch a Trifile as that.</P>
<P>No, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> but I tell thee, thou may'&s;t do better without it.</P>
<P>Why &s;o, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Gardener?</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays the Ma&s;ter,</HI> becau&s;e it will do thee no Good.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> it wou'd do him good to be &s;ure, when he came to &s;ee another Place.</P>
<P>Why, look you, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;uch a Cer|tificate as I mu&s;t give you, will do you no good, indeed.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> will you not give me &s;uch a Certificate as the Law directs?</P>
<P>Yes indeed will I, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> and that is &s;uch as is according to your De&s;ert.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid the Gardener,</HI> I have been an ho|ne&s;t Servant.</P>
<P>No, hold there, <HI>&s;ays the Ma&s;ter,</HI> I can't &s;ay that indeed.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays the Gardener,</HI> what, will you put this little trifling Difference into a Certi|ficate?</P>
<P>I'll put in nothing but the Truth, <HI>&s;ays the Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>What Truth, <HI>&s;ays the Gardener?</HI> And be|gan to be &s;awcy again.</P>
<P>Look you, <HI>&s;ays the Ma&s;ter,</HI> don't be &s;awcy again, for I will not lye for you, nor a&s;&s;i&s;t you to deceive any-body el&s;e, as you have me.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="222">
Well, <HI>&s;ays the Gardener,</HI> give me a Certi|ficate, and put what you will into it, &s;ay your wor&s;t, I value it not.</P>
<P>Say you &s;o, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> well, my Cer|tificate &s;hall be ju&s;t and fair, and make you your be&s;t of it; upon which he wrote his Certificate, as follows.<Q>I <HI>A&mdash; W&mdash;</HI> do hereby certify, that the Bearer <HI>G&mdash; M&mdash;.</HI> &s;erv'd me as my chief Gardener, two Years and one Quar|ter; that he is a Per&s;on capable of di&s;|charging the Place of a Gardener, but was di&s;mi&s;s'd by me for neglecting his Bu&s;ine&s;s, robbing me of my Time, and for his &s;awcy Tongue. Witne&s;s my Hand this twentieth Day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1721. <HI>A&mdash; W&mdash;</HI></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to give you a farther Relation of this Affair of the Certificate, &s;o I &s;ay no more to it now, only this; the Fellow took it, and went away, and had &s;o little Wit as to &s;hew it among his Comrades, and Fellow-Gardeners, which he did (as he thought) to expo&s;e his Ma&s;ter; but they in return made it publick, and the poor Fellow became &s;o known by it, that indeed it was an effectual Certificate to him, for no Gen|tleman wou'd employ him, and he kept out of Place, 'till he was almo&s;t &s;tarv'd; but of that al&s;o hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="223">
I &s;hou'd have told you, that in he fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e between this Gentleman and his Gardener, he ask'd the Fellow the Que&s;tion in few Words, that I formerly ask'd my O|ver&s;eer, namely, <HI>Whether he did not think it a</HI> Theft <HI>to rob his Ma&s;ter of his Time, if he took Wages of him for it, and did not work?</HI> He &s;aid, as above, he own'd it &s;hou'd not be &s;o, and that it &s;hou'd not be &s;o often: But when his Ma&s;ter ask'd him again, and kept him to it, that it was <HI>Robbery,</HI> he an&s;wer'd, <HI>no indeed,</HI> he did not think any-thing like it; he might &s;ay it was a Fault, but every Fault did not make a Man a <HI>Thief.</HI></P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you count nothing Thievery but what a Man mu&s;t (or may) be hang'd, or tran&s;ported for.</P>
<P>Truly, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he thought it was no Theft, for the Law had not made any Puni&s;hment for it, and if it had been Theft, there wou'd have been a Law again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Very well, <HI>&s;ays his Ma&s;ter,</HI> there is no Law expre&s;ly to puni&s;h a Man with corporal Pu|ni&s;hment for being a Bankrupt, and yet we of|ten &s;ay, that in &s;ome Ca&s;es a Bankrupt is no better than a Highwayman; nay, that he de&s;erves to be hang'd a thou&s;and times more than one that robs upon the Road.</P>
<P>The Gardener, however, wou'd not yield to it on any Account what&s;oever, that rob|bing his Ma&s;ter of his Time ought to be cal|led Robbing him at all, or Theft; that it was but what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call a <HI>Peccadillo,</HI> a
<PB N="221" REF="224">
&s;mall Fault, that there was nothing in it, but it was what every-body did as well as he, and therefore he might do it as well as every|body el&s;e.</P>
<P>This impudent barefac'd robbing their Ma|&s;ters of their Time, and ju&s;tifying that it is no Theft, is the Foundation of almo&s;t all the impudent Carriage of tho&s;e kind of Servants, who&s;e Service con&s;i&s;ts in Labour; for (fir&s;t) it makes them impatient of Reproof, and &s;awcy, if they are &s;poken to, as if they were injur'd, not their Ma&s;ters; that they ought to have the Liberty to play at their Work, when they thought fit, and that the Ma&s;ter had not Right to take any Notice of it; and if they are put away for &s;uch Behaviour, they take upon them to rail plentifully at the Inju&s;tice of it.</P>
<P>And this brings me to a Part I have not &s;poken to yet, namely, the manner in which the Servants generally behave here in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> when they are di&s;mi&s;s'd any Service.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is very &s;eldom that a Servant can be put away by any Gentleman, but that, as above, they are full of it, that they are injur'd; that they were put away for nothing, or &s;ome Trifle; nay, 'tis very &s;eldom they will own, that they were put away at all; but that they wou'd &s;erve no longer; that they did not like; and that they had come away upon &s;ome very ju&s;t Di&s;content; and 'tis
<PB N="222" REF="225">
very rare, but on &s;uch Occa&s;ions they will rai&s;e &s;ome &s;candalous Lye or other on the Family they come from.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But on the other-hand, if the Crime is notorious, and they have nothing to &s;ay to hide it, then their Behaviour is &s;till wor&s;e, and they rail at, and abu&s;e the whole Family, in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>From one or both the&s;e Ca&s;es it generally happens, that whenever a Gentleman turns away a Servant in this Country, he is &s;ure to make an Enemy: I hinted this before, when I told you how far this goes with the Gentlemen here, and how patiently they &s;ub|mit to be bullied and in&s;ulted by their Ser|vants, for Fear of being rail'd at, and abus'd by them, when they are gone: But I mu&s;t add al&s;o, that it is not always &s;o neither; &s;ometimes an unthankful Rogue meets with a Ma&s;ter that knows how to deal with him; and for your Diver&s;ion I &s;hall here give you a Story that has very lately been the Subject of Satisfaction to all our Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>A certain Citizen, who had his Country Hou&s;e in a Village near <HI>London,</HI> had a Ser|vant, who he had kept many Years, and had employ'd him in &s;everal matters of Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as meer Servitude; and having had him &s;o long, that he was (as it were) natu|raliz'd

to the Family, it appear'd that he had really a Kindne&s;s for the Fellow.</P>
<P>Had the Man had the u&s;e of but a mo|derate Share of common Sen&s;e, he might have con&s;ider'd, that tho' his Ma&s;ter had a Kindne&s;s for him, and did often bear with, and pa&s;s by his Mi&s;demeanours, yet that he might one time or other come to be tir'd of him; and that it was not in human Na|ture to be always winking at the Abu&s;es, and ill Behaviour of a Servant; it was ea&s;y for him to know, that his Ma&s;ter did not wink, becau&s;e he cou'd not &s;ee, for he knew his Ma&s;ter was no Fool; and he was him&s;elf not Fool enough to be ignorant, that whatever he was formerly, he was now be|come a very un&s;ufferable Fellow, and &s;uch as no Ma&s;ter cou'd, or indeed ought to bear with.</P>
<P>But whatever he might &s;ee, and know of him&s;elf, nothing cou'd bring him (it &s;eems) to reform, or to mend his Manners; but he grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; was drunken, idle, pilfering, and withal, an intolerable Swear|er: To compleat it all, he grew &s;awcy and in&s;olent to his Ma&s;ter; as I have told you, they all do; and whenever he got Drink in his Head, was more particularly abu&s;ive to his Ma&s;ter, than at other times.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter, who&s;e particular Aver&s;ion was the Vice of Drunkenne&s;s, but more e&s;pecially in his Servants, had &s;everal times differ'd with him upon that particular Occa&s;ion;
<PB N="224" REF="227">
and &s;ometimes, as well as he lov'd him, had turn'd him away for it, but was &s;till prevail'd with, by &s;ome Interce&s;&s;ion or other, and par|ticularly by his Re&s;pect which he had for the Fellow, to take him again.</P>
<P>This Fellow harden'd in that Part of his Carriage, which particularly merits the Name of Ingratitude, and which render'd him mo&s;t ba&s;e, becau&s;e offer'd to a Ma&s;ter, and a Fa|mily, to which he was bound by infinite Ob|ligations; &s;uch as rating the Station he was in, namely, of a Servant, were as binding in their Nature as he was capable of receiv|ing; yet behav'd &s;o, that he became a Nu|&s;ance even to the whole Family; and indeed un&s;ufferable, for he was not only a Thief, a Drunkard, idle, and negligent in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and withal, intolerably rude, and &s;awcy, when reprov'd; but he introdu'd other Thie|ving into the Family, which were at la&s;t ex|pos'd, by the very Ob&s;ervation of the Neigh|bours, who cou'd not &s;ee the Family &s;o abus'd, without acquainting them of it.</P>
<P>Upon this, his Ma&s;ter turn'd him, and his Dependants off, and di&s;mi&s;s'd him his Service; and yet even this his Ma&s;ter did with Calmne&s;s, and without doing him&s;elf that Ju&s;tice upon him, which the Law wou'd have ju&s;tify'd him in; for the Laws here in matters of that Nature, are &s;uch, that this Fellow wou'd have been tran&s;ported, if his Ma&s;ter had thought fit to have carried his Re|&s;entment
<PB N="225" REF="228">
on to Extremity; but in Compa&s;|&s;ion to him and his Family he forebore that Part.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was the Fellow di&s;mi&s;s'd, but he run about the Town, raging, and &s;wearing at, and damning his Ma&s;ter, and the whole Family, from whom he had re|ceiv'd &s;o much good U&s;age, and &s;o many Favours; repre&s;enting his U&s;age as unju&s;t, and injurious, and as if he had done nothing to merit being turn'd off, or that being put out of his Service had cancell'd all the Ob|ligation of former Favours; a thou&s;and &s;can|dalous Lies were rais'd, and &s;pread about by him, thro' the Town; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> he fail'd not to give all po&s;&s;ible Te&s;timonies of the utmo&s;t Spite, Malice, and Rage, a|gain&s;t the whole Family; where he, and his Family, had (for &s;everal Years together) been &s;o well us'd, and &s;o much oblig'd.</P>
<P>But as the Characters of the Family were plac'd by Providence out of his Reach, and that all the Neighbourhood knew how much better they had merited from him, it re|turn'd all in his Face; nor did his Ma&s;ter, or the Family, much mind him; for as it was below their Re&s;entment; they took not the lea&s;t Notice of it, or of them; but the Fellow grew infamous by it, and gradually grew poor al&s;o, which mu&s;t be the I&s;&s;ue of &s;uch Conduct, for no Families of Note wou'd entertain him.</P>

It is true, Contempt is the be&s;t, and indeed the only way to treat &s;uch Fellows with, and 'tis &s;o &s;evere a Puni&s;hment upon them, for their Behaviour, that it exceeds either the Stocks, or the Correction-Po&s;t; but the Hard&s;hip upon Gentlemen, even in the Pra|ctice of &s;o much Self-denial, as that of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing their own Re&s;entments in &s;uch Ca|&s;es, is very great; and there are &s;ome Ca&s;es in Families, where the Abu&s;es receiv'd by &s;uch People can't be pa&s;s'd by; and this leads me to &s;ome Particulars, which really good Families are &s;o much abus'd in, by the Villany of turn'd-off Servants, both Men and Women, that it can't, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> be put up, without infinite Inju&s;tice to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nor indeed can this Article be well omitted, becau&s;e it has gone a greater Length in Family-Mi&s;chiefs, than any Part I have yet &s;poken to, and has been the Ruin of &s;ome Families of Note, within the&s;e few Years: The Fact is branch'd out into two Particulars.<LIST>

<P>That the In&s;ults of Servants is ri&s;en up to the fir&s;t Pitch of Villany, is now &s;o notorious, that a thou&s;and In&s;tances is to be given of it, and the Remedy is &s;o hard to be found, that the only Hope now left us for the Evil of it, &s;eems to lie in the Pra|ctice, being &s;o &s;candalous, that no Per&s;ons, of any tolerable Degree of Prudence, will lay any Stre&s;s upon it: The In&s;tances of &s;uch Attempts, having appear'd meerly ma|licious, are innumerable: Some Examples of this I cannot omit; it is true, they carry me a little off from the Men-Servants, this Part being chiefly in the way of the Wo|men, or Maid-Servants; but the Men are not without their Share of it.</P>
<P>A certain eminent Family, within the Com|pa&s;s of my Knowledge, had a particular Affront of this Kind put upon them, by a certain <HI>Maid-Servant,</HI> as &s;he was &s;uppos'd to be: The Lady being newly dead, the Gentleman (having three or four Child|ren) had hir'd a Hou&s;e-keeper to manage the Family, and kept two Maid-Servants under her, be&s;ides the Cook.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e-keeper was a &s;ober, grave Wo|man, that had a bad Husband, but he was yet alive, and as her Family was reduc'd by his Extravagance, and him&s;elf got fa&s;t by the
<PB N="228" REF="231">
Heels in the <HI>Fleet-Pri&s;on,</HI> &s;he was glad to get into &s;uch a Place as this was, for her Support; her Ma&s;ter, directing what Ser|vants he intended to keep, had left it to this Woman (his Hou&s;e-keeper) to hire &s;uch as &s;he thought proper for his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;he letting her Husband know that they wanted a Chamber-Maid (perhaps innocently too) that he might, if he heard of any, &s;end them to her, he &s;ends her a Creature, of his own procuring, to be hir'd; and as the mo&s;t impudent Creatures are &s;ometimes more than ordinarily qualify'd to counterfeit that Mo|de&s;ty, which they are not at-all ble&s;s'd with, &s;o this Maid appear'd with the Air of a mo|de&s;t &s;ober Girl, as much as cou'd be de&s;ir'd, and not only the Hou&s;e-keeper, but the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf was very well pleas'd with her.</P>
<P>She had not, however, been long in the Family, but, with a Subtlety beyond the Devil, &s;he cau&s;es a Feud in the Family, be|tween the Hou&s;e-keeper and another Maid, who was properly call'd the Nur&s;ery-Maid; and this &s;he manag'd with &s;uch Dexterity, that even the two Parties them&s;elves did not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he (the Chamber Maid) had any hand in it: This Quarrel run up to &s;uch a Height, that, <HI>in a Word,</HI> it begin to embroil the Family; for every Day (more or le&s;s) this Nur&s;ery Maid was affronting the Hou&s;e-keeper, 'till at length, the Cau&s;e came before the Ma&s;ter of the
<PB N="229" REF="232">
Hou&s;e, who &s;eeing his Hou&s;e-keeper evident|ly in the right, began calmly to per&s;wade the Maid to be quiet, and to make no more Di&s;turbance in the Family, but to mend what was complain'd of, and do her Bu&s;i|ne&s;s as &s;he &s;hou'd do.</P>
<P>The Maid &s;eeing her Ma&s;ter, tho' he had &s;poken very little to her Di&s;advantage, yet apparently again&s;t her, in&s;tead of taking qui|etly the Reproof which was &s;o much her Due, flies out in a Kind of Pa&s;&s;ion, and went raving about the Hou&s;e, among the other Servants, <HI>telling them,</HI> it was ea&s;y to &s;ee which way things went, and that the Hou&s;e-keeper wou'd be &s;ure to trample poor Ser|vants under Foot, when &s;he had her Ma&s;ter on her &s;ide; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> behav'd very &s;awcily, and indeed impudently to her Ma|&s;ter, intimating little le&s;s, but that &s;he had been told, that he was, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> too great with his Hou&s;e-keeper.</P>
<P>So great is the Power of Scandal, and &s;o greedily do the Minds of the common People entertain any thing that &s;avours of Reproach, that tho' the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf, believing his Character to be out of the Reach of &s;uch Tongues, de&s;pis'd it, yet he &s;oon found, that it had got Vent in the Family, and even in the Neighbourhood al&s;o; for &s;ome, who were concern'd for the Reputation of the Gen|tleman him&s;elf, came and acquainted him with it.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="233">
He was a little alarm'd at it then in|deed, and call'd his Hou&s;e-keeper to a hear|ing, for &s;he was alarm'd at it, as well as he; the Servants were then call'd together, and examin'd before the Hou&s;e-keeper's Face, and the two Neighbours pre&s;ent; all the Servants gave her a Character greater than &s;he de&s;ir'd, and declar'd, that they never &s;aw the lea&s;t Indecency in her Behaviour, in their Lives; and it was more particularly ob&s;erv'd, that the two Servants, who were really the Traytors in this Wickedne&s;s, were the forwarde&s;t, when it came thus to a hear|ing, to ju&s;tify their Ma&s;ter, and the Hou&s;e-keeper al&s;o, and with the greate&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s to the one, and Re&s;pect for the other.</P>
<P>But this look'd &s;o ill among the re&s;t of the Servants, that one of them, who indeed had been &s;u&s;pected, took the Occa&s;ion (in order to vindicate her&s;elf) to take the Maid &s;hort, and tell her, before her Ma&s;ter, and the Hou&s;e-keeper, that &s;he had been the for|warde&s;t to talk of the Hou&s;e-keeper, in a manner that did not become her, and began to be particular with her, and &s;eem'd in|clin'd to enter into &s;ome Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>But the &s;ubtle Wench, the Nur&s;ery-Maid, took her up &s;hort, and &s;aid, that was only in Mirth, and je&s;ting with one another, when &s;he had told a Story of a certain Gentleman, that had been a little familiar with his Hou&s;e keeper; but that &s;he had not the
<PB N="231" REF="234">
lea&s;t Thought of what was now &s;ugge&s;ted; that her Ma&s;ter had indeed been again&s;t her, in a Di&s;pute between her and the Hou&s;e|keeper, but that was as he pleas'd, &s;he thought no Harm upon that Account; and down &s;he falls upon her Knees, and makes loud Imprecations on her&s;elf, if ever &s;he en|tertain'd a Thought to the Prejudice of her Ma&s;ter's Reputation, or of the Hou&s;e-keep|er's either; and this Part of what &s;he &s;aid was really true, for &s;he knew (within her|&s;elf) that &s;he did not believe what &s;he had reported, but that &s;he had rais'd it all ma|liciou&s;ly, and of her own Head, or at lea&s;t by the In&s;tigation of the other Maid, mention'd above, who, &s;he al&s;o knew, did it with a De&s;ign to &s;upplant the Hou&s;e|keeper.</P>
<P>However, this Creature manag'd her De|&s;ence with &s;o much Art, and fac'd down the other Maid with &s;o much Confidence, and &s;o many Words, that they were all di&s;mi&s;s'd; the Ma&s;ter was defam'd, and the poor Hou&s;e|keeper not only bla&s;ted in her Reputation, but her Husband was enrag'd, and (tho' a Pri&s;oner) was hardly kept from in&s;ulting the Gentleman, and his Wife too; and tho' all this went on to a very unhappy Length, yet &s;till the Servants were all purg'd, and &s;tood clear of being the In&s;truments.</P>
<P>But the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, as he was made unea&s;y at fir&s;t, was much more &s;o, when he found that (notwith&s;tanding all his
<PB N="232" REF="235">
Servants had &s;aid) the Scandal encreas'd, and &s;pread farther and farther upon him; and be&s;ides that, he had &s;ome Intimations, that this Nur&s;ery-Maid, notwith&s;tanding all &s;he had &s;aid before, and notwith&s;tanding all her Imprecations, had &s;till let fall &s;ome lit|tle Reflections, and had &s;hewn, that nothing but Fear re&s;train'd her, for &s;he was re&s;olv'd to ruin the Hou&s;e-keeper, if &s;he cou'd, ha|ving retain'd an implacable Grudge again&s;t her, from the fir&s;t Quarrel, as above.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Gentleman order'd that Maid to be turn'd off, and giving her a Month's Wages (not a Month's Warning) had her turn'd out of Doors that very Night; he wou'd not order the Hou&s;e-keeper to do it, becau&s;e he wou'd not encrea&s;e the Quarrel between them; then as he found, that howe|ver innocent the poor Woman was, the Re|proach wou'd never die, unle&s;s &s;he was re|mov'd too, he re&s;olv'd to put her off al|&s;o; tho', as he was fully &s;atisfy'd of the Wrong done to her, he thought it was par|ticularly hard upon her, as it was al&s;o upon him&s;elf, with Re&s;pect to his Family, becau&s;e &s;he was a very u&s;eful and faithful Servant.</P>
<P>The poor Woman was under a great Affliction, the Lo&s;s of her Place being a Kind of Ruin to her, the Circum&s;tances of her&s;elf, and of her Husband con&s;ider'd; but &s;he was confounded, and her coming from her Place made le&s;s grievous to her, when
<PB N="233" REF="236">
going from her Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, directly to her Hu&s;band in the <HI>Fleet</HI> Pri&s;on, in&s;tead of receiving her kindly, as he us'd to do, he flew out in a Rage at her, abus'd her, and fell upon her with his Hands too, that &s;he had much a-do (and not <HI>but</HI> by crying out, and &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners coming in to help her) to e&s;cape with her Life, and all the while knew nothing what the Rea&s;on of it all was; after his fir&s;t Fury was over, and &s;he cou'd get Room to talk with him, he charg'd her po&s;itively with being a Whore, and a Whore to her Ma&s;ter, and &s;hew'd her a Letter, which he had written to her Ma|&s;ter, reproaching him with abu&s;ing him in debauching his Wife, intimating, that if his Misfortunes had not pinn'd him down in &s;uch a Place as he was in, he wou'd have come, and taken his Revenge with his own Hands.</P>
<P>When the poor Woman &s;aw this Letter, and what Mi&s;chiefs had been &s;o near her, &s;he was glad in her Mind, that &s;he was come away from her Ma&s;ter, for that &s;he &s;aw things were gone too far to have been otherwi&s;e; but &s;he &s;et her&s;elf with all her Cunning, to find out (if po&s;&s;ible) who it cou'd be, who had carried their Malice to &s;uch a Height.</P>
<P>There was a poor Woman in the Pri&s;on, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was to clean the Rooms, run of Errands, tend &s;ick Pri&s;oners, and any &s;uch things as Occa&s;ion offer'd, to get her Bread; this Woman was a &s;en&s;ible good

Sort of body, and &s;harp enough, and above all, had a &s;ingular Character in the Place for her Faithfulne&s;s, and Hone&s;ty to her Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>This poor Creature was either in the Man's Chamber, or near it, when he fell foul on his Wife, as is &s;aid above, and did her En|deavour to deliver the poor Wife out of his Hands, and con&s;equently came to know &s;ome|thing of the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>After the Man's Wife (the Hou&s;ekeeper) had, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> got a little farther into the Affair, and found how it &s;tood between her and her Husband, &s;he took this poor Woman a&s;ide, and engaging her to Secrecy, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, <HI>told her</HI> the whole Ca&s;e, and withal (giving her &s;omething in hand, with Promi&s;e of more) employ'd her to find out (if po&s;&s;ible) who it was that cou'd be thus malicious, to bring &s;uch a horrid Story to her Husband.</P>
<P>In the mean time, to go back to the <HI>Nur|&s;ery-Maid,</HI> as &s;he was turn'd off with &s;ome Re&s;entment, &s;o &s;he went away full of Re&s;entment; and &s;he was no &s;ooner out of the Hou&s;e, but &s;he went about, railing at the Hou&s;e-keeper, and at her Ma&s;ter too; openly calling the fir&s;t a <HI>Whore,</HI> and not forbearing to &s;ay, &s;he was &s;o to her Ma&s;ter; and &s;o im|politick was &s;he in her Di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he form'd &s;everal Stories, which &s;he pretended to &s;ay were of her own Knowledge; particularly, that &s;he &s;aw the Hou&s;ekeeper go into her

<P><HI>You mu&s;t take it with you as you go,</HI> that the other Servant, who, as I hinted, had kindled this Flame from the Beginning, was the Per&s;on that privately &s;et all the&s;e Wheels at work, and gave this fooli&s;h Wench (the Nur&s;ery-Maid) all her Cue; <HI>told her</HI> tho&s;e Stories of the Hou&s;e-keeper's being in her Ma&s;ter's Chamber all-Night, of the Print on the Pillows, and in the Bed; and affirm'd that &s;he watch'd, and that &s;he &s;aw them, but brought the other Wench (who was forward enough of her&s;elf to be reveng'd of the Hou&s;e-keeper) to take it all to her|&s;elf, and tell the Story in her own Name, which &s;he did, as above.</P>
<P>This &s;ubtle Creature al&s;o made the &s;ame hot, pa&s;&s;ionate Girl go to the Hou&s;e-keeper's Husband in the Pri&s;on, and tell him all the vile Stories the cou'd invent, which had put him into &s;uch a Rage, and made him beat his Wife; and to propo&s;e to him, that he &s;hou'd

<P>Nor did &s;he fail of her De&s;ign, for eve|ry-thing an&s;wering her End, &s;he got the Hou&s;e-keeper turn'd away, <HI>as you have heard;</HI> after which, with a Smile in her Face, and a &s;mooth Tongue, &s;he went and offer'd her Service to her Ma&s;ter, to be Hou&s;e-keeper, 'till (as &s;he pretended with a feign'd Mo|de&s;ty) he cou'd provide him&s;elf more to his Mind.</P>
<P>In this Addre&s;s to her Ma&s;ter, &s;he fail'd not to rail plentifully at the Rudene&s;s of the Nur&s;ery-Maid, &s;ugge&s;ted how &s;he had certainly wrong'd the poor Hou&s;e-keeper, and been the Cau&s;e of her Ruin, and how ju&s;tly his Wor&s;hip had put her away; that &s;he de&s;erv'd to be puni&s;h'd, for that &s;he had certainly done it in meer Malice, on Ac|count of the Quarrel they had with one another, when his Wor&s;hip (<HI>&s;o &s;he call'd her Ma&s;ter</HI>) decided in favour of the Hou&s;e|keeper; that &s;he had heard her &s;ay &s;he wou'd be reveng'd of her, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>

<P>The poor Woman bu&s;ied her&s;elf here and there, about the Room, as u&s;ual, and &s;eem'd to take no Notice of any-thing; but as &s;he had li&s;ten'd very attentively to all &s;he had &s;aid, and (with Dete&s;tation) ob&s;erv'd how &s;he endeavour'd to in&s;inuate Jealou&s;y into the Man, and exa&s;perate him again&s;t his own Wife, &s;he re&s;olv'd to hear a little more of it, if &s;he cou'd; &s;o finding &s;he had &s;ully vent|ed her Rage, and &s;uppo&s;ing it wou'd not be

<P>She readily offer'd her Service, but when &s;he came to the Door, &s;he pretended the Turnkey was not at the Door, but wou'd come immediately; and &s;o ask'd her to go into a little Room, which &s;he knew to be empty, and &s;it down; &s;o &s;he gets her into the Room.</P>
<P>Here &s;he falls a bemoaning her poor Ma&s;ter above Stairs, that he &s;hou'd have &s;uch hard Luck, and be &s;o treated by his Wife, when he was under the Affliction of being in Pri|&s;on, and &s;o brought the Wench, who was full of it, and apt enough to be talkative, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> &s;he brought her to tell all the Story over-again, and to name the Hou&s;e-keeper's Name, and her Ma&s;ter's Name, the Place where he liv'd, and all &s;he cou'd think of; which was what the wi&s;e poor Woman wanted, for above &s;he had heard the Story, but had not the Knowledge of Per&s;ons and Names; but here the unwary Fool told her Story without any Re&s;erve, without the lea&s;t Caution, not dreaming &s;he was ju&s;t taken in her own Snare.</P>

<P>When &s;he was rid of her, &s;he went im|mediately, while it was fre&s;h in her Memo|ry, and &s;et down in Writing every-thing that was material, that &s;he had &s;aid; with the Names, and Circum&s;tances, and Times of every Action; as well what &s;he had &s;aid to her below, as what &s;he had &s;aid before to him above Stairs; and this &s;he did, that &s;he might be &s;ure to do Ju&s;tice to the Man's abus'd Wife, and that &s;he might do no Wrong to the Wench.</P>
<P>When the Hou&s;e-keeper came again, which was not 'till two or three Days after, &s;he &s;top'd her, and wou'd not let her go up to her Husband; for, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> he is in a Range again, for here has been an Agent with him, enough to enflame ten Husbands; &s;o &s;he took her into the &s;ame Room, <HI>ond told her</HI> the whole Story, <HI>as above.</HI></P>

The Woman, who kept the Shop, expect|ed what happen'd, <HI>namely,</HI> that &s;he wou'd fall upon the old Story, and thinking it wou'd not be convenient, that &s;he &s;hou'd be brought in as an Evidence again&s;t any Servant, and for what might be &s;aid in her Shop too, for that then no Servants wou'd care to come to her Shop, &s;he &s;lipt into a Back-room, where &s;he (as it happen'd) had another Wo|man, a Friend, that was come from <HI>London</HI> to &s;ee her; &s;o &s;he brought out her Friend into the Shop, upon &s;ome Pretence or other, and growing all familiar together, it was not very long e'er the Maid began her Story, about her being turn'd away at &s;uch a Hou&s;e, and why her Ma&s;ter put her away; boldly hinting that &s;he had &s;een a little too much, <HI>and the like;</HI> then the Stranger put in her Que|&s;tions, and holding up her Hands, made an Admiration that &s;uch a thing &s;hou'd happen, &s;o-and-&s;o, and in &s;uch a Family too, &s;he thought the Gentleman had been quite another Per|&s;on, <HI>and the like;</HI> this drew the weak pa&s;&s;ionate Wench in, to tell all her Tale, ay, and more than her Tale too; &s;o that wherever <HI>&s;he</HI> came, <HI>&s;he</HI> found room to add &s;omething or other to the Story.</P>

<P>However, <HI>&s;he</HI> found Friends at &s;ome length of time, and giving Bail, <HI>&s;he</HI> got her Liberty again for a-while; and not fore&s;ee|ing what was like to follow, &s;he was at fir&s;t as &s;awcy as ever; but her Friends, who knew better things, and who found, that the Gentleman re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute her very warmly, e&s;pecially for the poor Woman's Sake, and more e&s;pecially when they came to know what Evidence they had again&s;t her, warn'd her a little of her Dan|ger, and &s;o <HI>&s;he</HI> behav'd &s;omething quieter.</P>

that <HI>&s;he</HI> had good Authority for what <HI>&s;he</HI> had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Some of her Friends carried this to the Hou&s;e-keeper that pro&s;ecuted her, <HI>but &s;he an&s;wer'd, &s;he</HI> was a poor Woman, and <HI>&s;he</HI> cou'd not afford to pro&s;ecute two or three Folks; and be&s;ides, <HI>&s;he</HI> might &s;ay what <HI>&s;he</HI> had &s;aid, only to &s;lip her own Neck out of the Collar, and when a Pro&s;ecution &s;hou'd be begun again&s;t the Per&s;on <HI>&s;he</HI> had accus'd <HI>&s;he</HI> might deny it all again, or might run away, and not appear at the Trial, and &s;o <HI>&s;he</HI> (the Hou&s;e-keeper) might be ca&s;t for Want of Evidence; and for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, <HI>&s;he &s;aid, &s;he</HI> wou'd not run the venture of going from one to another; but the <HI>Nur&s;ery-Maid</HI> was her Mark, <HI>&s;he</HI> had &s;ufficient Evidence again&s;t her, and <HI>&s;he</HI> wou'd look no farther; that be&s;ides <HI>&s;he</HI> was the Per&s;on who had en|deavour'd to &s;et her (the old Hou&s;e-keeper's) Husband again&s;t her, by a forg'd and &s;lande|rous Charge, and had made him abu&s;e her, as he had done, and <HI>&s;he</HI> wou'd have the Truth of it out, if <HI>&s;he</HI> cou'd; but wou'd look no farther for her Enemy, than where <HI>&s;he</HI> had found her.</P>
<P>But this Accident of the Nur&s;ery-Maid, pretending to &s;ay <HI>&s;he had Authors for what &s;he had &s;aid,</HI> had a farther Effect than what has been yet ob&s;erv'd, and that in two dif|fering ways; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the <HI>new Hou&s;e-keeper,</HI> who, as I have &s;aid, was at the Bottom of all the Mi&s;chief, and had been &s;o from the

Beginning, but had craftily conceal'd her&s;elf, began to be apprehen&s;ive, that this Wench wou'd di&s;cover her, as the Author of all; and therefore &s;he under-hand pu&s;h'd on the old Hou&s;e-keeper not to accept of the Offer of a Di&s;covery; and put all tho&s;e Arguments into her Mouth, which I have ju&s;t menti|oned, and pre&s;s'd her to pro&s;ecute the Maid with the utmo&s;t Severity, and to bring her to a Tryal with all the Speed <HI>&s;he</HI> cou'd.</P>
<P>This <HI>&s;he</HI> manag'd with &s;uch Dexterity, that the Tryal was ha&s;ten'd, all her Pro|po&s;als of a farther Di&s;covery were rejected, and <HI>&s;he</HI> was left to expect the wor&s;t, which indeed was bad enough for her; for, upon a full Tryal, the Maid was &s;entenc'd to pay a Fine to the Pro&s;ecutor, for her Damage in the Lo&s;s of her Place (<HI>I do not remember the Sum exactly</HI>) and to be whipp'd publick|ly at the Cart's Tail, thro' the Town where her Ma&s;ter's Country.

<P>But the Story does not end yet; the poor Wench (tho' <HI>&s;he</HI> had been &s;oundly la&s;h'd) had a Fine al&s;o to pay to the Hou&s;ekeeper, for Reparation of Scandal, and Lo&s;s of Em|ployment; this they took hold of, and &s;he having intimated that <HI>&s;he</HI> cou'd make &s;ome Di&s;covery, the Hou&s;e-keeper, wil|ling

<P>Yes, <HI>&s;ays the Hou&s;e-keeper,</HI> every one of them.</P>
<P>The Maid laugh'd at her again, and, with a kind of a Je&s;t, repeated the Words, <HI>not every one, not every one,</HI> &s;everal times.</P>

<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays the old Hou&s;e-keeper,</HI> I'll go and fetch &s;uch Witne&s;s of it, as &s;hall convince you of the Truth of what I have &s;aid; and with that <HI>&s;he</HI> left her, and went out; the next Morning <HI>&s;he</HI> went to the <HI>new Hou&s;e|keeper,</HI> innocently told her all their Di&s;cour&s;e, and wou'd have had her gone with her to the Pri&s;on, to have ju&s;tify'd what <HI>&s;he</HI> had &s;aid; for <HI>&s;he</HI> had &s;poken with &s;uch Eagerne&s;s again&s;t the Wench, that the <HI>old Hou&s;e-keeper</HI> cou'd not imagine, but <HI>&s;he</HI> was hearty in it all, and wou'd have &s;aid the &s;ame to her Face.</P>

<P>To the great Di&s;appointment of the for|mer, her Ma&s;ter was gone to <HI>London,</HI> and it being very uncertain whether he wou'd return at Night or no, and &s;he &s;o warm and eager that &s;he cou'd not wait, &s;o &s;he re&s;olv'd to go to his City Hou&s;e, and &s;peak with him there; but &s;he mi&s;s'd him there too, and at la&s;t heard he was gone to his Country Hou&s;e again; but then it was too late for her to go &s;o far, &s;o &s;he was oblig'd to defer it 'till next Morning, re&s;olving to be there before he was up.</P>
<P>But the <HI>new Hou&s;e-keeper</HI> had the better Luck, and &s;he manag'd it wickedly enough, if &s;he cou'd have carry'd it afterwards as &s;he ought to have done; for her Ma&s;ter coming home, and &s;he having thereby an Advantage to tell her Tale by her&s;elf, &s;he boldly comes up to him, and de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with him; &s;o he went into a Parlour by him&s;elf, and call'd her in.</P>
<P>She was cunning enough to take hold of the Advantage which the Occa&s;ion put into her Hands, and which he knew not how to get off of; for &s;he began with a Shower of
<PB N="252" REF="255">
bold Reproaches on him, for betraying his own Secret, <HI>as &s;he call'd it,</HI> and expo&s;ing her to <HI>Su&s;an;</HI> that he had &s;ent to <HI>Su&s;an</HI> by her Hands, but gave her Order to conceal his Name, and give it her in her own Name; and that then he had di&s;cover'd it to his Favourite Mrs. &mdash;, the <HI>old Hou&s;e keeper,</HI> and had &s;ent her after, to tell <HI>Su&s;an</HI> that it was his Money.</P>
<P><HI>As I have &s;aid above,</HI> this plung'd him a little, for it was &s;o in Fact, and he knew not what to &s;ay to it; he was heartily vex'd that the <HI>old Hou&s;ekeeper</HI> had acted &s;o fooli&s;hly, or fal&s;ly, he did not well know which; and 'till he could &s;ee her, he &s;carce knew what to think of it all; but recollecting him&s;elf a little, and remembring what the other <HI>Hou&s;ekeeper</HI> had told him, he found him&s;elf oblig'd to bring it out &s;ooner than he intended, and to charge her downright with the Fact, <HI>namely,</HI> with being the Original of all the Noi&s;e that had been made in the Hou&s;e, and the Abu&s;es both upon Mrs. &mdash; the <HI>old Hou&s;ekeeper,</HI> and al&s;o upon him&s;elf; and yet that &s;he had prompted both of them to pro&s;ecute poor <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> when &s;he was her&s;elf the Cau&s;e of it all; that <HI>Su&s;an</HI> was but her Tool to kindle the Flame; and that all this was done to get the <HI>old Hou&s;ekeeper</HI> out, and to get into her Place.</P>
<P>She pretended to be the more enflam'd at this; deny'd the thing with great A&s;&s;evera|tions (for &s;he knew <HI>Su&s;au,</HI> who was her
<PB N="253" REF="256">
Accu&s;er, was not at-hand) but threw back the Dirt of it in his Face with an unlucky Advantage, and impudently told him, <HI>It &s;eem'd truly now, not &s;o unlikely to be true, as She had thought it had been,</HI> that he was &s;o great with his old Hou&s;e-keeper, and, <HI>for ought She knew,</HI> there might be &s;omething in it; &s;eeing he held &s;o clo&s;e a Corre&s;pon|dence with her, that when he had entru&s;ted her with a &s;ecret Errand, he &s;hou'd go and di&s;cover it him&s;elf to that very Woman, and &s;end &s;uch a Creature as that after her, to expo&s;e her; and that <HI>there mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing more in it than ordinary,</HI> that there was &s;uch a Confidence between them; that &s;ince it was &s;o, &s;he thought &s;he had &s;taid long enough among them, and that if he pleas'd to order her to be paid her Wa|ges, &s;he wou'd deliver up her Charge, and be gone, for &s;he was re&s;olv'd &s;he wou'd not &s;leep another Night in his Hou&s;e, and he might go to Bed to his old Favourite as freely as ever, &s;he wou'd not interupt him.</P>
<P>The Gentleman was really out done by her, for &s;he had &s;uch a plau&s;ible Ground of Complaint, that he was confounded: However, tho' &s;he had treated him with mo&s;t provoking Language, yet he calmly <HI>told her,</HI> he had his particular Rea&s;ons for letting Mrs. &mdash; know what he had done, that yet he did not bid her go, and make it known to <HI>Su&s;an;</HI> but if &s;he had done &s;o, he did not value it, and did not doubt but
<PB N="254" REF="257">
Mrs. &mdash; had &s;ome Rea&s;ons for what &s;he had done too, which he &s;hou'd know when he &s;aw her, and he did not doubt al&s;o but &s;he wou'd &s;oon let him hear of it: It &s;eems his Hou&s;e-keeper had been &s;o nimble upon him (<HI>for &s;he was as &s;harp as a Hawk</HI>) that &s;he had not given him time to hear in the Family, that the old Hou&s;e-keeper had been there to &s;peak with him, and was gone to <HI>London</HI> to &s;eek him, as &s;he had left Word.</P>
<P>But having calmly, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> given her this Au&s;wer, &s;he continued the more &s;awcy, and grew in&s;olent to the la&s;t Degree; boa&s;ted much of her being faithful and hone&s;t, and reproach'd him in &s;uch an un&s;ufferable Man|ner with his &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with the other Hou&s;e-keeper; that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> he was almo&s;t provok'd to kick her out of Doors; but he re&s;train'd his Anger, and did not touch her him&s;elf, but cau&s;ing her Wa|ges to be immediately paid her, and her Boxes and Trunks, or what &s;he had in the Hou&s;e, given her, he caus'd her al&s;o to be turn'd out that very Hour, which was indeed what the cunning Jade wanted; and thus they parted with as much Re&s;entment, as <HI>Su&s;an</HI> and they had done before.</P>
<P>But when Mrs. &mdash;, the old Hou&s;e-keeper, came the next Morning, and gave the Gentleman an Account of the whole Story, as it really was, then he found he had been much in the wrong; that &s;he had gain'd a Point of him, in letting her
<PB N="255" REF="258">
go &s;o quietly away, and that heought to have &s;ent her immediately to the Hou&s;e of Correct|ion: He wou'd have retriev'd the Mi&s;take, and &s;ent to &s;everal Places in the Town to have &s;topt her again, but &s;he had been in too much Ha&s;te to get away over-Night, to be ta|ken hold of again in the Morning; <HI>in a word,</HI> &s;he provided for her own Safety, and was fled.</P>
<P>She had indeed, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> a va&s;t Ad|vantage over him in the fir&s;t Part of the Sto|ry; I mean that which related to his &s;ending the Money in the Woman's Name, and di&s;|covering the Secret to his <HI>old Hou&s;e keeper;</HI> and this Creature; who told her Tale after|ward in the Street, told that Part of it &s;o well, and &s;o effectually kept it &s;eparate from the Rea&s;on of the Di&s;covery, which was the Counter-part of the Fact, that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> all the Neighbours ran away with it, and it did more towards fixing a real Re|proach upon the Gentleman him&s;elf, than all that had been done or &s;aid before; nor did the crafty Creature want Emi&s;&s;aries to &s;upport the Reflection, which &s;he &s;o diligently ply'd, and &s;o artfully &s;upported her&s;elf in, that it blacken'd the Gentleman, in a Manner never to be effectually wip'd off; tho' he was innocent, as an unborn Infant, of the Charge, or of any Appearance of it.</P>
<P>So dreadful a thing is Slander, on the Tongue of a &s;ubtle In&s;trument, and &s;o much is the Reputation of the mo&s;t innocent Per|&s;on

in the World at the Mercy of an in&s;olent Servant, when turn'd away, be the Occa&s;ion ever &s;o ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor was the puni&s;hing this malicious Creature able, either to wipe off the Blot, or to &s;top her Mouth; &s;ome thought indeed he was in the wrong to pur&s;ue her, but ha|ving the Evidence of the Maid <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> and of another, which &s;he brought in again&s;t her, he at la&s;t taking hold of her by Accident, brought her to Ju&s;tice, and had her la&s;h'd as &s;everely as <HI>Su&s;an</HI> had been before her; but it had not &s;o good an Effect upon her, as it had upon <HI>Su&s;an;</HI> &s;he went raving and rail|ing ten times the more at him, and at the other Hou&s;e-keeper too, only by how much &s;he had &s;marted for it before, &s;he was now more wary of her Words, and &s;poke, tho' not with le&s;s Malice, yet with more Crafr, framing her Words &s;o as that they cou'd not be taken hold of, and continued implacably bent to ruin the Reputation of the Gentle|man as much as po&s;&s;ible; and this way of abu&s;ing her Ma&s;ter was as fatal and mi&s;chie|vous to him, tho' not &s;o dangerous to her, as the other, nor was there any Remedy for it but Patience; &s;o vile a thing is the Tongue of an in&s;olent Servant, when puni&s;h'd for their Di&s;orders; and this is one of the things which we want a Law again&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> and which is one of the Rea&s;ons of my giv|ing you this Story; for if there is no Me|thod

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IHIS comes to acknowledge the Favour of Your's, of the 10th, in An&s;wer to my La&s;t, in which, I ob&s;erve, you &s;ugge&s;t two things as Doubts, upon the Accounts I gave you of the In&s;olence, and un&s;ufferable Pride of Ser|vants in this Country.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You &s;ay, that certainly the Engli&s;h mu&s;t be very cruel, arbitrary, and (which is &s;till wor&s;e) unrea&s;onable Ma&s;ters, or</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Surely England has no Laws of Subor|dination in Force, for the particular Regulation of Servants, for &s;ecuring their Obedience, and &s;tating what is, or is not their Duty.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="261">
I confe&s;s, 'tis very rational to &s;ugge&s;t in general, that there mu&s;t be &s;omething or other uncommon, that &s;hou'd be the Rea&s;on of &s;uch things as the&s;e; that it is not thus in other Nations; and that Servants are more at Command, and more &s;ubject to their Ma&s;ters, or more ea&s;ily to be puni&s;h'd in other Countries; and that if it is not &s;o here, there mu&s;t be &s;ome Rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;ign'd for it, and that you think one of the&s;e mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But as I know you will bear with my Freedom, I take the Liberty to &s;ay, particu|larly as to the&s;e two things you are en|tirely mi&s;taken; and, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as to the Beha|viour of Ma&s;ters to Servants; I hope you will allow, (to avoid frequent Repetitions) that when I &s;ay <HI>Ma&s;ters,</HI> I &s;hou'd be un|der&s;tood to mean Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es as well as Ma|&s;ters, for they &s;tand in the &s;ame Place, in Point of Argument.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the contrary is true to an Ex|tream, and it is partly to the Account of this very thing I place the fir&s;t Ri&s;e of the In&s;olence of Servants; 'tis &s;o far from being owing to the ill U&s;age of Servants by their Ma&s;ters, that the un&s;ea&s;onable Lenity, Kind|ne&s;s, and Tenderne&s;s to Servants in this Coun|try, is the very Cau&s;e of it: <HI>In a Word,</HI> as I may truly &s;ay, that the poor know not what it is to be Servants, &s;o the Rich, <HI>I mu&s;t acknowledge,</HI> know not how to be Ma|&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="262">
I remember a Pa&s;&s;age of the famous Co|lonel <HI>Kirk,</HI> who commanded a Regiment of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers in the <HI>French</HI> Service, and was fam'd for his Severity of Di&s;cipline: He had order'd a Sergeant to correct a pri|vate Centinel for &s;ome Error in his Exer|ci&s;e, when he was &s;eeing the Regiment han|dle their Arms; go and knock that Dog down, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel;</HI> the Sergeant belie|ving the Colonel meant, that he &s;hou'd cane him only, did it very &s;everely; when he had done it, the Colonel call'd the Sergeant to him; when he came, lend me your Hal|bert, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> which the Sergeant did very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively; look here, <HI>&s;ays the Colonel,</HI> I'll &s;hew you how to knock a Sol|dier down, and with the Words, knock'd the poor Fellow down with his own Halbert: It is true, <HI>Kirk</HI> was &s;aid to be too unmer|ciful and &s;evere, but on the other-hand, he had the be&s;t di&s;ciplin'd Regiment in the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Body, which con&s;i&s;ted of five Brigades; he was faithfully &s;erv'd, and if he had commanded his Men to have jump'd into the Fire, they wou'd certainly have done it.</P>
<P>They have a Proverbial Saying in this Country, which, they &s;ay, was taken from the late U&s;urper <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> who his wor&s;t Enemies acknowledge to be a good Soldier; they tell us that it was his Saying, that to have a good Army you mu&s;t <HI>hang well</HI> and <HI>pay well;</HI> and his known, that his own Regiment (which wore white Cloaths
<PB N="260" REF="263">
and were call'd <HI>Cromwel's Lambs,</HI>) wou'd follow him thro' Fire and Water, never were known to turn their Backs in the Field, but had cut in Pieces many a Re|giment of the be&s;t Cavalry the King had; while at the &s;ame time, 'tis &s;aid, he had fir&s;t or la&s;t pi&s;tol'd three of them with his own Hand, when they had mutiny'd up|on &s;ome Occa&s;ion or other, and refus'd to march.</P>
<P>There is &s;ince that, another Proverbial Saying upon the very Subject I am upon, <HI>namely, That the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>are the be&s;t Ma&s;ters, and the wor&s;t Servants in the World:</HI> If I were to invert that Saying, I wou'd place it thus, <HI>That the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>have the unea&s;ie&s;t Servants, becau&s;e they are the ea&s;ie&s;t Ma|&s;ters in the World: In a Word,</HI> as I hinted ju&s;t now, we may &s;ay, <HI>that in</HI> England <HI>the</HI> Rich <HI>know not how to be Ma&s;ters, and there|fore the</HI> Poor <HI>know not how to be Servants.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Town in <HI>Hertford&s;bire,</HI> not far from <HI>London,</HI> of which they &s;ay, <HI>That there is no-body</HI> Poor <HI>enough to keep the</HI> Town-Hogs, <HI>or</HI> Rich <HI>enough to keep a</HI> Hog-herd: This Town is an Emblem of the Country it &s;elf, but e&s;pecially of the Poor, and 'tis very much to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, for tho' the Poor are too low to keep a Servant, yet they are ge|nerally too high to be Servants them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in the World, but that they are the ea&s;ie&s;t, kinde&s;t, tendere&s;t Ma&s;ters to Ser|vants,
<PB N="261" REF="264">
<HI>that is certainly true,</HI> and this is cer|tainly the true Rea&s;on of the Mi&s;chief I am &s;peaking of; <HI>In a Word,</HI> as a &s;lack Rein in Government encourages Factions and Rebel|lions, &s;o <HI>ea&s;y Ma&s;ters</HI> make <HI>&s;awcy Servants;</HI> the Ma&s;ter that will bear to be impos'd upon &s;hall be impos'd upon; nay, I have heard &s;ome &s;ay, he that will be in&s;ulted ought to be in&s;ulted; I will not &s;ay &s;o, becau&s;e 'tis an Ingratitude in the Servant, but I mu&s;t allow it is an unpardonable Folly, and Mi&s;take in the Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I have often di&s;gui&s;s'd my&s;elf for this pur|po&s;e, and mingl'd in among the Mob of &s;uch Fellows as tho&s;e, who we call Footmen; I have convers'd with them over a Mug of <HI>Porter,</HI> as they call their Alehou&s;e Beer and Ale; and there how have I heard them boa&s;t over their Ma&s;ter's Kindne&s;s to them, and how they cou'd do any-thing they pleas'd? that they valued not their Ma&s;ters a Shilling, and that they dur&s;t not be angry with them; that if they did quarrel, d&mdash; 'em they wou'd be gone, and their Ma&s;ter cou'd not do with|out 'em.</P>
<P><HI>One Fellow</HI> was talking thus, and I entred into a &s;hort Dialogue with him about it; I ask'd him what his Ma&s;ter wou'd &s;ay to him if he got drunk, and if at another time he &s;taid out all-Night, <HI>and the like?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Say to me, &s;ays he, why, he wou'd &s;wear at me, it may be.</HI></P>

<HI>Why then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I wou'd &s;wear, it may be, as fa&s;t as he, and d&mdash; as fa&s;t he.</HI></P>

<P>Well, and what then, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI></P>
<P><HI>O,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I knew one good Word wou'd pacify him, and he wou'd be pleas'd pre&s;ently, for my Ma&s;ter is the ea&s;ie&s;t good-natur'd Man in the World.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that is to &s;ay, your Ma|&s;ter is the ea&s;ie&s;t Fool in the World:</P>
<P><HI>Nay,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I cannot deny but my Ma&s;ter is</HI> ea&s;y, <HI>and that makes his Servants all play upon him, as they do:</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> do you not own you are very much oblig'd to your Ma&s;ter, for being &s;o good|humour'd?</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="266">
<HI>Yes,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but I mu&s;t own I don't make him a bit the better Servant for that:</HI></P>
<P>How do you mean, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> not a bit bet|ter?</P>

<P>Well, but, <HI>&s;aid I, Jack,</HI> you mu&s;t own you are a Dog, an ungrateful Dog to him, to im|po&s;e upon his good Nature in that Man|ner?</P>
<P>I don't value that a Farthing, <HI>&s;ays Jack,</HI> if my Ma&s;ter is a Fool, it's the better for me, is it not; then I can be Ma&s;ter when I plea&s;e?</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There was a poor hone&s;t Ma&s;ter Weaver in our Country kept &s;everal Apprentices, and (as I &s;uppo&s;e) being poor, and having but little Hou&s;e-room, he and his Apprentices lay all in a Chamber together, tho' not all in a Bed; one Night his Ma&s;ter being gone to Bed, in cold Winter Weather, and the Candle out, feeling a cold Wind come in &s;omewhere, calls to his Boy thus, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays the Ma&s;ter; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is the Way of Servants replying, or an&s;wering in the Country, when they are call'd; as to &s;ay <HI>Sir,</HI> or <HI>Madam,</HI> is to an&s;wer a Call in the&s;e Parts about <HI>London.</HI></NOTE><HI>Ay,</HI> Ma&s;ter, &s;ays <HI>Jack: I believe that Win|dow is open, Jack,</HI> &s;ays the Ma&s;ter: <HI>I believe it is Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Jack;</HI> &s;o they lay &s;till awhile.

&s;ays <HI>Jack;</HI> but &s;till <HI>Jack</HI> did'nt &s;tir: By this time the Ma&s;ter's Patience was &s;pent, and feeling the Cold come in at the Window &s;till, he rouzes up him&s;elf like a Man; <HI>Why, Jack,</HI> &s;ays he? <HI>Ay, Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Jack</HI> again very impudently: <HI>You lazy Son of a Whore,</HI> &s;ays the Ma&s;ter, <HI>why don't you ri&s;e and &s;hut the Window there?</HI> Mu&s;t I come and rouze you? <HI>Get up you Dog, and &s;hut the Window, Yes, Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Jack, now you &s;peak in earne&s;t;</HI></Q> &s;o he gets up, and &s;huts the Win|dow, and all was well.</P>
<P>And this, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> is the true Picture of you Servants, is it?</P>
<P>Yes, indeed, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it is &s;o all over the Na|tion, and will be &s;o; while Ma&s;ters act without the Authority of Ma&s;ters, Servants will ne|ver &s;hew the Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience of their Place.</P>
<P>And you learnt it of <HI>Jack,</HI> did you, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI></P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that was my fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on, in|deed, but I am improv'd &s;ince by farther Ex|amples.</P>
<P>And pray, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> what is that you call <HI>im|prov'd?</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to do as little Work as I can, to get into good Company as &s;oon as ever my Ma&s;ter's Back's turn'd.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to come home drunk, and be &s;awcy too, is that a Part of it?</P>
<P>Why, as to that, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it will happen &s;o &s;ometimes, but that's nothing; I do well e|nough with my Ma&s;ter for that, for give him

but a good Word again, <HI>when I come to my&s;elf,</HI> all is over with him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and that encourages you to do &s;o again, perhaps, the next Opportunity that offers.</P>
<P>Why, truly, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> in all Difficulties, when Folks come off ea&s;y, they are the for|warder to venture again: We had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e more be&s;ides this; I feign'd my &s;elf to be a Servant too, but that I had a very &s;evere &s;trict Ma&s;ter, that wou'd not bear with a Servant being ab&s;ent from his Bu&s;ine&s;s; that if any of the Servants were heard to &s;wear, it was with the greate&s;t Interce&s;&s;ion imaginable that they avoided being turn'd away; but if once they got drunk, they had no more to do, but &s;trip, and be gone; off with their Livery, take their Wages, and out of Doors; they had as good go voluntarily as &s;tay to be turn'd out, for I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> my Ma&s;ter never gave a Servant Occa&s;ion to be drunk twice in his Service.</P>
<P>That's very hard, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> why any poor Servant may be overtaken, and not de&s;ign it.</P>
<P>It's all one, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> our Ma&s;ter makes it &s;o &s;tated a Rule in the Family, that it is no Hard|&s;hip, becau&s;e all the Servants know it as &s;oon as they come into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and you are all &s;ober Dogs, ar'n't you? Pray what kind of Servants has your Ma&s;ter? are they good for any-thing?</P>
<P>All very good Servants, I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>&s;aid I, except my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="271">
Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it is certainly the only way, your Ma&s;ter is in the right of it, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> and none but &s;uch Ma&s;ters will have good Servants; but I wou'd not live with him if he wou'd give me double Wages, for all that.</P>
<P>Why, wou'd you not re&s;train your&s;elf to have a good Place?</P>
<P>Not I, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> 'tis not the Way among Servants at this time; I have been us'd to be Ma&s;ter wherever I have been, and I can't bear tho&s;e &s;trict Orders of Families, not I; Con|finement won't do with me, I mu&s;t drink with my old Friends &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>Well, &s;o do we too, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> for if we ask Leave, we are never deny'd; he is as civil and kind <HI>that way,</HI> to us, as we can de&s;ire; only we mu&s;t keep our time when we pro|mi&s;e to return, and not come home Drunk; and I do not &s;ee any great Harm in that, not I.</P>
<P>No Harm in it! <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> why 'tis making a Jail of his Hou&s;e, &s;uch a Service would be <HI>Bridewell</HI> to me; I wou'd as lieu beat Hemp, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> every jot, and then he pour'd out two or three G&mdash;d d&mdash;mn him's at &s;uch a Ma&s;ter; but all the way he own'd that they were the Ma&s;ters that got good Servants; only that he wou'd not &s;erve any Man in <HI>England</HI> upon &s;uch Terms, not he, for he wou'd have his Liberty, ay that he wou'd.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e between this Fel|low and I, you may &s;ee the &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, <HI>in &s;bort,</HI> that 'tis the Ea&s;ine&s;s and Kindne&s;s of Ma&s;ters in <HI>England</HI> that has ruin'd the Ser|vants;
<PB N="269" REF="272">
you will &s;ay indeed, 'tis a Token of a prodigious Ba&s;ene&s;s in the Minds of the Poor of this Country, that they may be forc'd by Di&s;cipline, but are not to be oblig'd by Kind|ne&s;s, and that, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> cannot be help'd.</P>
<P>Among the civil U&s;age giveu to Servants in <HI>England,</HI> I mu&s;t place the Privileges they have in their Places: The Hunt&s;men have their Field-Money, and are allow'd to carry out the Hounds upon all Occa&s;ions, to gra|tify the Gentlemen round, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> to get their Field-Money.</P>
<P>The Game-keepers are tru&s;ted with Powers to take away Guns and Dogs from the mean|er People, and they abu&s;e the Tru&s;t, <HI>as you &s;hall hear,</HI> and the Game too.</P>
<P>Head-Carters and upper-Plowmen are often &s;ent to Market, and entru&s;ted both to buy and to &s;ell, <HI>and you &s;hall hear how they improve.</HI></P>
<P>Your Coachmen have Privileges of their own making, <HI>namely,</HI> of having Compliments from the Trade&s;men, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> all tho&s;e who &s;upply you with things needful to the Equigage; &s;uch as the Coachmaker, Harne&s;s|maker, Corn-chandler, Farrier, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the like is the Ca&s;e with all the Stewards, But|lers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are Advantages which our Gentlemen in <HI>France</HI> are too wi&s;e to put into the Hands of Mercenaries and Scoundrels, &s;uch as many times have them here; I a&s;|&s;ure you 'tis far from obliging the&s;e Gentle|men, <HI>as they call them&s;elves,</HI> who I am talking of; far from engaging them to be more faith|ful
<PB N="270" REF="273">
to their Ma&s;ters, more careful of their Ma&s;ters Intere&s;t, or more affectionate to their Service; <HI>on the contrary,</HI> it fills their Pockets with Money, and that ill-gotten too; &s;o that it eats a Hole into their Con&s;ciences, and makes them &s;cruple no Villany to encrea&s;e it; that Money makes them proud, in&s;olent, and un|&s;ufferable within-Doors, and drunken and wicked without-doors: But let me take them in their &s;everal Capacities acting to the&s;e Prin|ciples, and con&s;ider them apart.</P>
<P>Your Hunt&s;man, if you do not give him Leave to take the Hounds out when he plea|&s;es, and can get Company, &s;hall take care you &s;hall have little Sport enough when you go out your &s;elf; nay, he &s;hall batter your Hor|&s;es, baulk your Hounds, and &s;how you no Sport, or to be &s;ure kill you nothing; while at the &s;ame time, he turns Poacher for the unfair Sport&s;men, and &s;hall &s;how them a Hare &s;itting as often as they plea&s;e, for the u&s;ual Bribe of <HI>a Schilling:</HI> If you find him out, and make a Fault of it, he turns &s;hort upon you, and tells you &s;aucily, <HI>It is his Fees, or Vails,</HI> (as they call it here) <HI>and if you wou'd Hunt in Company, as other Gentlemen do, that the Hunt&s;man might get his Field-Money, he wou'd not do &s;o;</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Field-Money is Money given by all the Gentlemen in the Field where they are hunting, as often as they find a Hare fitting.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, he wou'd have you keep a Pack of Hounds, like my Lord-Mayor, not for your &s;elf, but for your Hunt&s;|man,
<PB N="271" REF="274">
that he may get all the young Rakes round the Country, and all the loo&s;e Peo|ple he can, into the Field, and hunt what, and where, and how they bid him, for the meer &s;ake of his <HI>Field-Money,</HI> which they call the Hunt&s;man's Fees; till they beat out the Hounds, and hackney them till they are good for little or nothing; and if you will not do that, you &s;hall, <HI>as above,</HI> go out two or three Days together perhaps, and have no Sport your &s;elf; kill nothing, nay perhaps, find nothing, while your Hunt&s;man, who at the &s;ame time knows of a Brace or two of Hares &s;itting, &s;hall on purpo&s;e to mi&s;s of them, draw quite another Way; if you hap|pen to di&s;like, and bid him go this or that Way, he'll tell you, he beat all that Ground in the Morning, before you came out; or per|&s;wade you, that he knows where there is a Hare that way that he is beating, and &s;o draw you off from the Game that he is not willing you &s;hou'd find, till you are thorowly fatigu'd, and your Hor&s;es too; and if he lets you kill one &s;ingle Hare, you are to take it for a great Favour.</P>
<P>The next is your Ranger, or Park-keeper: It is his Bu&s;ine&s;s not only to range the Park, and &s;ee that the Pale is in repair, and the Co|vert in order, but to pre&s;erve the Deer; and he has &s;everal large Privileges; &s;ome, when any Deer is kill'd for his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e; but greater, when any Pre&s;ents are made of Deer alive, or of Veni&s;on; and the&s;e Advantages
<PB N="272" REF="275">
make the Keeper's Place a very good thing.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of being the more faithful, un|le&s;s you con&s;ider him extraordinary, and eve|ry now-and-then give him Leave to &s;ell a fat Buck for you, to &s;ome great Fea&s;t, <HI>and the like,</HI> you &s;hall feel the Con&s;equence of it; for you &s;hall have the Park never fail of being robb'd three or four times in every Sea&s;on, and the be&s;t Bucks carry'd off, four or five Brace at a time: Then to &s;olve his own Cre|dit, he has the Impudence to accu&s;e &s;everal of the young Fellows round the Country, who know nothing at-all of the Matter; and if any of them cannot give a good Account of them&s;elves, they are at lea&s;t, loaded with a Scandal, and render's &s;u&s;pected not only there, but to all the Gentlemen in the Country; when at the &s;ame time your Keeper has Hor|&s;es &s;ent to fetch the Veni&s;on, by his own Or|der, and as punctually as his Ma&s;ter him&s;elf, from certain Pa&s;try-Cooks, and &s;ly Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> who deal in &s;uch Goods; and per|haps you chance, if you come to <HI>London,</HI> to give a couple of Guineas to &s;ome or other of them, for a Haunch of your own Veni&s;on: On the other hand, if in the Country you want any Veni&s;on for your own Table, or to make a Pre&s;ent of to any neighbouring Gentle|men, your Park keeeper &s;hall tell you, there is very little fit for your U&s;e, and that if you kill any more 'till next Sea&s;on, you will &s;poil your Park.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="276">
This is &s;o known a Practice, that I need but conver&s;e with a few Gentlemen in the Neigh|bourhood of this City, and I might furni&s;h you with a great many diverting Stories upon this Subject; and two or three Park-keepers are, I think, at this very time in Pri&s;on for &s;uch Rogueries.</P>
<P>This indeed may be &s;aid to be a kind of Thieving, and &s;o not to come directly into the Subject I am upon; but as it is one of the&s;e Sorts of Thieving, which the Servants of this Age will not allow to be Robbery, I place it rather upon the in&s;olent Temper of the Men; for 'tis certain, tho&s;e that trade with them in this wicked Trade, call it no|thing but a Love of Sport, and to have an hone&s;t Keeper or two befriend them in it; but the Laws are of late more &s;evere in this Ca&s;e than formerly, and we &s;hall ('tis hop'd) find &s;ome Examples made e'er long, of which I &s;hall not fail to give you an Account.</P>
<P>But I return to the Villany which more immediately re&s;pects the Per&s;ons of their Ma|&s;ters: The next is the Game keeper, or as it was call'd formerly, the <HI>Falconer.</HI></P>
<P>Your Game keeper &s;hall lead you about, with your Dogs and your Nets, and hardly &s;hew you a Covey of Birds, in riding over a whole Lord&s;hip: At the &s;ame time he is un|der Contract with the Higglers, for &s;o many Dozen of Partridges in the Sea&s;on, which he &s;upplies by going out in the Night with a Pair
<PB N="274" REF="277">
of <HI>Trammels,</HI> with which he kills all the Birds about your E&s;tate.</P>
<P>If you &s;end him out with your Gun, he &s;hall go about all the Morning, and (perhaps) &s;end you home a Hen Phea&s;aut, and at the &s;ame time &s;end all the re&s;t to Market; if he &s;hoots a Woodcock or two now and then, or a Snipe, you mu&s;t count it a Rarety, while at the &s;ame time he &s;ets his Snares in all the &s;pringy &s;wampy Places in the Woods, and near you, and takes from five to ten Brace in a Night.</P>
<P><HI>In a Word,</HI> while the Gentlemen in the Parliament Hou&s;e are making Laws to pre&s;erve the Game, their own Servants are the greate&s;t <HI>Poachers</HI> in the Country; and under Pretence of killing the Game for their Ma&s;ters, they make a Property of the Sport, and &s;upply the Huck&s;ters and Carriers with all kinds of Fouls, which the Law forbids them to touch.</P>
<P>It was on this very Account, that the Gen|tlemen found it nece&s;&s;ary to get farther Laws made for pre&s;erving the Game, and particu|larly one which forbids, upon &s;evere Penalties, any Partridges, Phea&s;ants, Quails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being &s;old in the Shops or Markets; or by any Hig|lers, Poulterers, or &s;uch Per&s;ons what&s;oever; but notwith&s;tanding that, and even in Spight of Laws and Penalties, the Trade goes on &s;till.</P>
<P>By this Means all the Laws for pre&s;erving the Game are only made Laws for rai&s;ing the Price of the Game in the Poulterer's
<PB N="275" REF="278">
Shops; for as 'tis a kind of contraband Trade, they drive it on clande&s;tinely, and under-hand; but Hares, Partridges, Phea&s;ants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are to be bought now as ea&s;ily as before, only they make the Buyer pay double Price; and whereas a good Hare might have been bought before for a Shilling or eighteen Pence, now they will have four or five Shillings for it, but &s;till the Game is as much de&s;troy'd as before.</P>
<P>From the&s;e very mode&s;t Fellows come we next to the Plowmen and Carters, Husband|men, and the like.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e you now to be a Gentleman in <HI>En|gland,</HI> that keeping Part of your E&s;tate in your own Hands, keep al&s;o a Head Carter, or Baily, to manage your Team of Hor&s;e, &s;ee your Land plow'd, order the Cows, the Sheep, <HI>and the like;</HI> the Servants are all under this Man, as the Director of their Labour; he orders them when to plow, when to &s;ow, and in what Places; how, and where, and when the Sheep are to be folded, the Calves and Lambs &s;uckled, the Fat Cattle &s;old off, and all &s;uch things; and &s;ometimes he is tru&s;ted &s;o far, as to be &s;ent to Market to &s;ell what is to be di&s;pos'd of: In all which he under&s;tands his Bu&s;ine&s;s to be, that no-body &s;hall cheat you but him&s;elf; while you are ea&s;y at all he does he is ea&s;y with you too, becau&s;e he makes his Market of you, but if you &s;traiten him, and pretend to look after him, his Manners are all vani&s;h'd on a &s;udden, and he is as &s;our
<PB N="276" REF="279">
and &s;urly you &s;carce know how to &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>If you anger him, or find Fault with his Management, he &s;hall in his Pa&s;&s;ion whip your Hor&s;es, &s;tarve your fatting Swine, &s;uckle other Men's Calves with your Cows, and carry on your Affairs with a general Neg|lect, 'till you give him &s;ome kind Words again, and &s;o make him Satisfaction, by putting it in|to his Power to cheat you again (if it be po&s;|&s;ible) wor&s;e than he did before.</P>
<P>Every Market-Day, 'tis &s;uppos'd, you &s;end him to Market with &s;omething or other of the Produce of the Farm; 'tis not worth your while to go (perhaps) 7 or 8 Miles, to &s;ell a Score of Sheep, or a Couple of incalv'd Cows, or a Load of wheat or Barley; but <HI>Thomas,</HI> the Carter, goes to Market with them, and when he returns, he very hone&s;tly tells you he &s;old them for <HI>&s;o much;</HI> when 'tis very ordinary to have him &s;ell them for 40<HI>s.</HI> in 10<HI>l.</HI> more than he gives you an Account of: If you dare but &s;uppo&s;e, that they might &s;ell for more, he begins with you (for Thieves are always the fir&s;t to cry out of being &s;u&s;pected) he tells you, that he wonders your Wor&s;hip will not take the Trouble to go to Market your&s;elf; that he wou'd much rather you wou'd go, and &s;ee every thing &s;old to your Mind; that he wou'd go with all his Heart, and &s;tand in the Market, you need but be at the Tavern hard by, and he wou'd bring eve|ry Chapman to you, and your Wor&s;hip might
<PB N="277" REF="280">
make your own Bargains, take the Money your&s;elf, and &s;o be &s;atisfy'd that you are not cheated; that he thinks nothing of the Trouble of going to Market, but hates the tru&s;t of it, for that if the Markets run low, it al|ways makes a poor Servant be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>All this while going to Market is his only Aim, and he is undone if he does not; and yet if you went your&s;elf, unle&s;s it were without him too, he wou'd cheat you to your Face, and whi&s;per a low Price to the Buyer, tho' he &s;har'd the Profit with him; and &s;o cheat you of 40<HI>s.</HI> to get but 20 of it for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I wou'd not load innocent Men willingly, but this I may venture to &s;ay, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;uch is the Degeneracy of the Servants of this Country, that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> except here and there an extraordinary Servant, <HI>and I &s;carce know where that extraordinary Man is to be found;</HI> I &s;ay, except &s;uch an extraordinary one, no Gentleman can &s;end his Servant with Corn or Cattle to Market, but he &s;hall be cheated.</P>
<P>It is but the very Week the&s;e Sheets were writing that a Gentleman of my Acquain|tance, living in the Country, &s;ent up about 50 Load of Hay to <HI>London</HI> by Water, to &s;ell, en|tru&s;ting a Man to &s;ell it for him, intending to &s;end a much greater Quantity, Hay being this Year between three and four Pound <HI>per</HI> Load, at <HI>London</HI> Market.</P>
<P>His Servant gave him an Account of the fir&s;t ten Load, as &s;old ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Load
<PB N="278" REF="281">
cheaper than (as he found by neighbouring Farmers) Hay was &s;old for tho&s;e very Market Days; this made him Ma&s;ter of &s;o much Jealou&s;y, as to &s;et a more faithful Per&s;on, as a Spy, to watch his Servant at the Market, and (if po&s;&s;ible) to inform him&s;elf how he &s;old; by the means of this Intelligence he arriv'd to a Di&s;covery, that his Servant had put 10<HI>s. per</HI> Load in his Pocket, out of eve|ry Load of Hay of the whole Parcel, having &s;old it for &s;o much more than he gave his Ma&s;ter an Account of; and the doing him|&s;elf Ju&s;tice upon this fraudulent Servant is now upon his Hands.</P>
<P>Again, come to the Plowman, and meer la|bouring Husbandman; if he &s;ows in the Field, or thre&s;hes in the Barn, he will cheat you of your Corn, even to your Face: A Country Farmer that I knew, employ'd a poor Man to thre&s;h Wheat in his Barn, and every Evening, to prevent his being cheated, look'd upon the Heap of Corn, lock'd up the Barn-Doors, and &s;ent the poor Thre&s;her home to his Cottage, &s;eeing him out him&s;elf, that he might be &s;ure he was not wrong'd.</P>
<P>But one Day, having &s;ome Su&s;picion of his Man, he took Occa&s;ion to &s;end the Thre&s;her out in a Hurry, telling him there were Hogs gotten into a Clo&s;e newly &s;ow'd with Wheat, and which lay near the Barn; when the Man was gone, he makes that an Opportunity to &s;earch about the Barn, and in a Corner of the Mow, he finds hid a <HI>little leather Bag,</HI> with a|bout
<PB N="279" REF="282">
half a peck of Wheat in it; he took no Notice, nor did he remove the Bag, but cuts a little Bit out of it, with a pair of Sci&s;&s;ars, to|wards the top, &s;o that the Corn wou'd not run out, that he might know his Bag again, and leaves it as he found it: At Night he di&s;|mi&s;s'd the Thre&s;her, as u&s;ual, who walk'd away; but as &s;oon as he was gone, the Ma&s;ter runs a nearer way, and meets him in a narrow Field which he knew he would go through, and finds the little Bag of Wheat upon his Head, carrying it Home, as he &s;uppos'd.</P>
<P>He did not appear angry, or &s;urpriz'd, at|all, but after &s;ome other trifling Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>he &s;ays to him,</HI> and art thou going home di|rectly? Yes, <HI>&s;ays the Thre&s;her;</HI> and what ha&s;t thou got there, <HI>Goodman Thomas? &s;ays the Farmer;</HI> I doubt that's &s;ome of my Corn: The Fellow wou'd have denied it a little at fir&s;t, but &s;eeing him&s;elf di&s;cover'd, Why yes, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> 'tis &s;ome of the Sweepings of the Floor, but 'twas &s;uch a little, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I thought you wou'd not &s;cruple &s;uch a &s;mall Parcel, 'tis nothing but what you would have thrown to the Poultry: Poultry! <HI>Thomas, &s;ays the Farmer,</HI> but my Poultry are my own, and they help to pay my Rent; I a&s;&s;ure you, I thought you wou'd not have carried away any of my Corn.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Goodman Thomas</HI> began to be &s;urly, &s;eeing him&s;elf detected, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> he never work'd for any Ma&s;ter before, that wou'd not give him a handful of Corn for his Cocks and
<PB N="280" REF="283">
Hens: Well but <HI>Goodman Thomas,</HI> and &s;o per|haps wou'd l, <HI>&s;ays the Farmer,</HI> if you had assk'd me, but I don't love to have it taken without my Leave: The Fellow grumbl'd, and began to be &s;awcy, and offer'd to go: Well, well, <HI>Goodman Thomas, &s;ays the Farmer,</HI> I expect you'll bring it back-again in the Mor|ning when you come to Work.</P>
<P>Next Morning he came to Work; but when the Farmer ask'd for the Bag of Corn, <HI>Goodman Thomas</HI> made light of it, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> he hop'd he wou'd not &s;tand with him for &s;uch a &s;mall Matter: No, <HI>Goodman Thomas, &s;aid the Farmer,</HI> if you will ingenu|ou&s;ly own how often you have done &s;o; how often, <HI>&s;ays Thomas,</HI> why as often as we want it at home, I always take a little for our Ba|king: Why Ma&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> don't all the Thre&s;hers for you, do the &s;ame? I hope not, <HI>&s;ays the Farmer;</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, they that Thre&s;h for me, &s;hall not, if I can help it: Well, well, <HI>&s;ays Goodman Thomas,</HI> &s;ee where you'll get a Man to Thre&s;h for you, that don't do it: I thought it no Crime, not I, and &s;o laugh'd it off, and his Ma&s;ter forgave him, but di&s;mi&s;s'd him from his Work.</P>
<P>But Goodman <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Words were all made good, for as this made the Farmer more jealous, and con&s;equently more careful, the next three Thre&s;hers he hir'd, he took them all in the &s;ame Fact; with this Difference on|ly, that as <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;tole under half a Peck, one of them &s;tole a Bu&s;hel at a time, and the
<PB N="281" REF="284">
other Two about half as much each: So hard is it to get a Servant now, but will not only defraud you, and cheat you, but like Good|man <HI>Thomas,</HI> grin and laugh in your Face when they are di&s;cover'd, and think it very hard to be re&s;train'd; or huff and in&s;ult you, and tell you, 'tis no Crime; that 'tis their Fees, and they expect it; and that they wou'd not work with you for &s;uch Wages, if it was not for the other Advantages they make.</P>
<P>And it is on this Account that I name the Behaviour of the&s;e &s;ort of Servants, I mean Husbandmen; for it is the &s;ame Pride and and In&s;olence by which the Footmen and Hou&s;hold-Servants are made &s;awcy, that the other are made thievi&s;h and di&s;hone&s;t; and this is what we mu&s;t expect will follow in time, among all the re&s;t of our Servants; for when once they grow &s;awcy and impudent, they will not be long before they grow Thieves, 'tis a natural Con&s;equence of the thing; for when once Servants are arriv'd to a Con|tempt of their Ma&s;ters Per&s;ons, they can ne|ver be &s;uppos'd to have a &s;incere Regard to their Intere&s;t; and if they come to be regard|le&s;s of their Intere&s;t, they will &s;oon come to have the &s;ame Di&s;regard to their Property.</P>
<P>There is a kind of a Conte&s;t in <HI>England</HI> be|tween Ma&s;ters and Servants, which I never met with any-where el&s;e, concerning Hone&s;ty, and the Servants here have as odd a Notion of Hone&s;ty, as really they have of Liberty; and this fal&s;e Notion of Hone&s;ty is &s;uch, that,
<PB N="282" REF="285">
<HI>in &s;hort,</HI> it makes Thieves of half the Servants in <HI>England,</HI> and yet at the &s;ame time, they have the Impudence to call them&s;elves very hone&s;t Fellows, and wou'd think it very hard to be denied a Character as &s;uch, when they go from you: You &s;ee Goodman <HI>Thomas</HI> thought taking a little Wheat for his Family, for their baking, was no Di&s;hone&s;ty, 'twas what every-body did, and why &s;hou'd not he do it as well as another?</P>
<P>I mention'd the hone&s;t thieving of their Time before, which they think nothing of; their making their Ma&s;ters pay for tho&s;e Hours which they &s;pend at the Alehou&s;e to get drunk, <HI>I need not repeat it,</HI> that is one.</P>
<P>Leaving their Ma&s;ters, and running from their Work when there is the greate&s;t Nece&s;|&s;ity of their Service, is another: I knew a poor Farmer had his three Men-Servants run from him in the Prime of his Harve&s;t, being got into Company, and drunk, and left the poor Man de&s;titute of Hands to get in his Corn.</P>
<P>A Soldier de&s;erting his Colours, e&s;pecially in time of Service, is &s;hot to Death, without Mercy, and rea&s;on good, becau&s;e the Safety of his <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> is betray'd by his de|&s;erting, as much as it is po&s;&s;ible for him to be|tray it.</P>
<P>A Servant who hires him&s;elf to a poor Farmer, to do his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and runs from him in Harve&s;t, as much as in him lies be|trays him, and ruins him; and this very thing is &s;o notoriou&s;ly practis'd at this time,
<PB N="283" REF="286">
and is &s;o much a Grievance, that the Parlia|ment, &s;ince my writing the&s;e Letters, have it under Con&s;ideration to oblige Servants to per|form their Agreement, and &s;tay out the Year; and to empower the Ju&s;tices of Peace, and proper Officers, to puni&s;h fugitive Servants; and I doubt not but we &s;hall &s;oon have a very &s;evere Law upon that Subject. <HI>But of this hereafter.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Intended in this Letter to have enter'd into the great Article of the Behaviour of Women Servants, which, I a&s;&s;ure you, is at this time grown up to be as great a Grie|vance as the other; and I have by me &s;everal little Hi&s;tories of their Behaviour; particularly with re&s;pect to the Havock they make of the Reputation of the Families they live in; their Pride, haughty and in&s;olent Behaviour; gay dre&s;&s;ing, and profu&s;ion of Cloathing; by which it is now become frequent in middling Families, that the Chambermaids have better Laces, and finer Silks than the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and it is not ea&s;ie to know the Servants from the Daughters of a Family; and &s;ome of the&s;e little Hi&s;tories wou'd have pleas'd you very well: As particularly of a Gentleman in a Vi&s;it lately at a Hou&s;e of good Fa&s;hion, who being recommended to one of the Gentleman's Daughters, mi&s;took the Chambermaid for her who was de&s;ign'd for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and unhap|pily &s;tepping up to her, &s;aluted her fir&s;t, which Misfortune co&s;t him the lo&s;s of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the impudent Wench the lo&s;s of her Place.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="288">
I &s;hou'd al&s;o have furni&s;h'd you with &s;ome very good Accounts of the Di&s;a&s;ters of three of four &s;everal Ladies of Fortune, &s;old, or rather deliver'd into the Hands of Scoundrels, by their <HI>Maid-Servants;</HI> the Ladies wheedl'd in to marry them, as Fortunes, and the Wenches impudently a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Ravi&s;hers, for they cou'd be call'd little le&s;s, to violate that Honour which was with too ea&s;ie a Confidence put into their Hands; one of which <HI>She Devils</HI> we have &s;ince &s;een de&s;ervedly brought to the Gallows</P>
<P>I &s;hou'd likewi&s;e have diverted you with the over-and-above In&s;olence of <HI>Female Servants</HI> in the Duty of their Family-Bu&s;ine&s;s, very proper for the Information of the <HI>Senior</HI> La|dies, and for their <HI>Caution</HI> in the managing &s;uch <HI>Creatures,</HI> and for their <HI>Conduct</HI> when it is their Lot; <HI>as</HI> who&s;e is it not &s;ometimes, to be afflicted with &s;awcy and in&s;olent Ser|vants?</P>
<P>But I am already &s;well'd to a Bulk beyond my Expectation, and mu&s;t forbear dwelling any longer upon this Part, however enter|taining it may be: The <HI>Contents</HI> of my la&s;t Letter brings me nece&s;&s;arily back to that Part of your Enquiry which re&s;pects the Laws which we have in <HI>England</HI> again&s;t this Evil, and how tho&s;e Laws are put in Execution: I remember your Words were, That &s;urely we are deficient in <HI>England</HI> in point of Regu|lation; and that we want good Laws to &s;e|cure the due <HI>Subordination</HI> of the People; you in&s;inuate, that it cou'd not be, that Ser|vants
<PB N="286" REF="289">
cou'd thus &s;et up to be Ma&s;ters, and govern even the Ma&s;ters them&s;elves, and their Families al&s;o, as it is apparent they do, if we had Laws &s;ufficient to enforce their Obedi|ence, or if tho&s;e Laws for enforcing Obedi|ence, were &s;ufficiently ob&s;erv'd, or duly exe|cuted.</P>
<P>My An&s;wer indeed is, That our Deficiency is double.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Laws now in Force are not &s;ufficient; the Laws are good, but 'tis long &s;ince they were made; the Circum|&s;tances of things are alter'd in the Na|tion; the way of living is alter'd; the Rate of Things advanc'd; Wages are higher; Pride encreas'd; Vice grown rampant; Drunkenne&s;s (which is the Ruin of Servants) broke in like a Flood; Good-Manners declin'd; <HI>and in a Word,</HI> all Sence of <HI>Subordination</HI> is lo&s;t among us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Tho&s;e Laws which we have, and which are in Force, are ill executed; Magi|&s;trates are degenerated in them&s;elves, and Vice is crept in, even on the Bench; &s;o that it is not &s;o ea&s;ie to get the Drunk|enne&s;s and Debaucheries of the Poor di&s;|countenanc'd and puni&s;h'd, as it wou'd be if the Magi&s;trates were untainted with the <HI>Crimes</HI> they are to puni&s;h.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But la&s;tly, which is yet wor&s;e, the very <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> of Families them|&s;elves,
<PB N="287" REF="290">
by their Remi&s;sne&s;s in taking legal Remedies again&s;t the In&s;olence of Ser|vants, and again&s;t their refu&s;ing to &s;erve and &s;ubmit to their &s;aid <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> as the Law directs, is the great, <HI>and indeed,</HI> the chief Rea&s;on why the <HI>Laws</HI> have not their due Effect upon the lower <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> of Mankind, and why a <HI>due Subordination</HI> is not pre&s;erv'd between <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Servant,</HI> as the Law directs.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But you will be agreeably &s;urpriz'd, when I &s;hall tell you, that all this, and not this only, but all that I have already &s;aid upon the Subject of <HI>Servants,</HI> is confirm'd by the Parliament which is now &s;itting, having ta|ken this very Matter into their Con&s;ideration, and thinking it worth their while to in&s;pect the Laws which are now in Being between <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> in order to a new Re|gulation, and in order to making tho&s;e <HI>Laws</HI> more effectual.</P>
<P>It is evident that the Legi&s;lature &s;ees the Nece&s;&s;ity of rectifying this Matter; they &s;ee that the Rudene&s;s and In&s;olence of <HI>Servants</HI> is an un&s;ufferable Burthen; that it is become &s;o general, as to de&s;erve the Name of <HI>a Na|tional Grievance,</HI> and to call for an additional Force of Law to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>In this the Parliament acts as the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> who, when their <HI>Slaves</HI> rebell'd, re|&s;olv'd to arm them&s;elves with Whips, for their Correction, rather than with Swords, to &s;ub|due
<PB N="288" REF="291">
them by Conque&s;ts, &s;corning to attack them on the equal foot of Soldiers, and Men of Honour; or to let it be &s;aid, that they &s;toop'd to the Fear of their Arms; but went out arm'd again&s;t them as a ba&s;e and Scoundrel Race, who&s;e Spirits were levell'd to their Condi|tion, and knew not how to &s;hew their Faces to tho&s;e who they us'd to tremble at before.</P>
<P>Thus our Parliament here, in <HI>England,</HI> have acted in this <HI>Ca&s;e;</HI> for the Law is a Whip for the Offender; the Authority of the <HI>Lictor</HI> is arm'd with the&s;e Rods and Axes, and &s;up|ported by the Magi&s;trate; and the ba&s;e, rebel|ling, in&s;ulting Servant is order'd to remember his proper Station, and look that he behaves with due Obedience to his Superiour, or to ex|pect the Correction which his In&s;olence de|&s;erves.</P>
<P>This coming at the very Juncture of my writing the&s;e Letters, gives a very &s;atisfactory Sanction to my Opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Grie|vance was flagrant, and that I was not giving you the Trouble of writing to you on a Sub|ject which was trifling, and not worth Notice; I &s;hall therefore &s;top here for the pre&s;ent, and wait a-while, till we &s;ee what &s;ufficient Pro|vi&s;ion the Parliament will make in this Exi|gence for pre&s;erving the Government of our Families from the Encroachments and U&s;ur|pation of our Servants; for really, as things are now, Ma&s;ters, or Heads of Families, are no more Ma&s;ters; <HI>Subordination</HI> &s;eems to be at a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> and the Government is &s;har'd be|tween
<PB N="289" REF="292">
the Head and the Tail, the Ma&s;ter and his hir'd Servant; the la&s;t receives the Wages indeed, but the Work is done when and how the hir'd Gentlemen plea&s;e to perform; and if they think fit, 'tis often not done at-all.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give you here, as a Conclu&s;ion to the whole Work, a Repre&s;entation which has been prepar'd, for the In&s;truction of, and due Caution to the Hou&s;e-keepers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in this very needful Ca&s;e; I dare &s;ay you will be pleas'd with the Sight of it, becau&s;e it of|fers &s;omething towards a Remedy of this fla|grant Mi&s;chief; and which, if the Advice is taken, we may be in Hopes, that in Conjun|ction with the new Provi&s;ion now making in the Parliament, <HI>Servants</HI> may in a little time be brought to their Sen&s;es again, be made to know them&s;elves a little, and the Peace and due Government of Families may be again re|&s;tor'd.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'AS the In&s;olence of your Servants is your great Grievance, and gives you daily Offence, &s;o I cannot but believe, 'tis very agreeable to you, to hear that the Parliament has at length taken this Matter into their Con&s;ide|ration.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="294">
This is an unan&s;werable Te&s;timony of not the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Remedy only, but al&s;o of the Weight and Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e; that the Complaint is not trifling, or the Subject too mean to be concern'd about: We read, that in <HI>Athens,</HI> in <HI>Sparta,</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>Rome,</HI> but e&s;pecially in the former, the due Subjection of Servants was always thought worthy the Care of the Commonwealth; even the Diet and the Habits of Servants were provided for in <HI>Licurgus</HI> his In&s;titutions; the fir&s;t he pro|vided for, that the poor might not be op|pre&s;s'd, and the latter, that they might not forget that they were Servants.</P>
<P>I. He provided, that the Ma&s;ters &s;hou'd feed their Servants &s;ufficiently, that their Strength might be &s;upported for their Labour; and then he provided that the Servants &s;hou'd wear a particular Badge of their Servitude, that they might be known, upon all Occa&s;ions, to be what they were, namely <HI>Servants. N.B.</HI> This was for hir'd Servants, not Slaves.</P>
<P>Whether our Parliament will think fit to go this Length, I know not; but this I may appeal to your&s;elves for, that if they do not di&s;tingui&s;h the Servants from the Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, the Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es mu&s;t find &s;ome Ways to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves from their Servants, or (<HI>as already frequently happens</HI>) the Clark will
<PB N="292" REF="295">
&s;oon be wor&s;hip'd for the Ju&s;tice, and the Maid be ki&s;s'd in&s;tead of the Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The antient Laws for Regulation of Servants, and for a&s;certaining their Wages, and for obliging &s;ingle Per&s;ons to go to Service, are brought into Contempt; not &s;o much that the Rea&s;on and Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch Laws are not the &s;ame as ever, or if alter'd, are only greater and more pungent than ever; but becau&s;e Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es have &s;lacken'd the Reins of Family Go|vernment, and given a loo&s;e to the Pride and Vanity of Servants, and have by that Remi&s;sne&s;s let them, as it were, by imme|morial Cu&s;tom, go lawle&s;s, 'till their Ser|vants do not only forget, but indeed not &s;o much as know that any &s;uch Laws were ever in being, much le&s;s that they are &s;till in Force among us.</P>
<P>As, <HI>Gentlemen and Ladies,</HI> it is by your Lenity, and Remi&s;sne&s;s in governing your Servants, that they have forgot to obey, it lies at your Door to retrieve this Lo&s;s, by recovering your &s;elves, and rea&s;&s;uming the Authority which you have laid a&s;ide &s;o long, 'till you &s;eem'd to have lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>In a Word, 'tis for you, to be Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and then you will have Ser|vants be Servants again; for as has been &s;aid in publick, if Ma&s;ters will be trampl'd on, they &s;hall be trampl'd on, and they that will be in&s;ulted, may expect it: 'Tis an old agreed Maxim, that Good Ma&s;ters
<PB N="293" REF="296">
make Good Servants, but then it is to be de|bated what is to be under&s;tood by the Term a <HI>Good Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>He that, being remi&s;s in his Management, holds the Rein of his Family Government with a &s;lack Hand, or (as it were) throws them on the Necks of his Servants, may be call'd an <HI>Ea&s;y Ma&s;ter,</HI> but cannot be call'd a <HI>Good Ma&s;ter:</HI> To be a good Ma&s;ter is to be a Ma&s;ter that will do his Servant Ju|&s;tice, and that will make his Servant do him Ju&s;tice; he may be kind to a Ser|vant, that will let him &s;leep when he &s;hou'd work, but then he is not ju&s;t to him|&s;elf, or a good Governour to his Family; but he is not a good, or a kind Ma&s;ter, no not to the Servant him&s;elf, who will let him be drunk, when he &s;hou'd work, and &s;o of all other Vices; and therefore, <HI>in a Word,</HI> however plain and unplea&s;ant a Truth it may be, this is certain, 'tis a needful, a &s;ea&s;onable, and an unan&s;werable Truth, that the Want of Family Government is the Ruin of Servants; and it is &s;ince Family Di&s;cipline decay'd in <HI>England,</HI> and the good Example of Ma&s;ters ceas'd, that Servants have got the Head and Ma&s;ter&s;hip over us; and untill &s;omething of an orderly and vertuous Governing of Families comes in Fa&s;hion again among us, I fear that no Laws, Acts of Parliament, or publick Regulations, will be effectual to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="297">
Laws are of no Force where Vice and Scandal ennervate the Authority of the Ma&s;ter; drunken and di&s;orderly Families will be fill'd with drunken and di&s;orderly Servants; nay indeed, they are Seminaries of &s;uch, and &s;end them abroad fully in&s;tru|cted in Wickedne&s;s, to &s;pread the Contagi|on in other Families, and ruin the Servants wherever they come.</P>
<P>Wherefore for God-&s;ake, and for your own Sakes, nay, for your Servants Sakes, let Family Government be re&s;tor'd; and tho' you &s;hou'd not reform your&s;elves, which it may be hop'd this wou'd a little move you to, yet reform your Families, and &s;uf|fer no drunken, no &s;wearing, di&s;orderly Servant, to &s;tay in your Hou&s;es; if all Gentlemen wou'd di&s;mi&s;s &s;uch, and refu&s;e Certificates of Behaviour to them, they mu&s;t reform, or &s;tarve.</P>
<P>I am not to dictate to Parliaments, nor I hope do they need it, but an Overture or Propo&s;al may be accepted from Without-Doors, without any Offence: I wou'd then mo&s;t humbly propo&s;e, in Order to the com|pleat Regulation of Servants, a few Heads only, which, if duly ob&s;erv'd, wou'd go a great way to humble the Servants of this Age, and make them behave after a much different Manner than they do now.<LIST>

<P>If the&s;e Conditions, or &s;uch like, were enacted by a Law, and &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd by all the Heads of Families in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> I dur&s;t boldly &s;ay, that the Great Law of <HI>Subordination</HI> wou'd again take Place, Ser|vants wou'd learn to know them&s;elves, and Family Government wou'd be &s;oon re|&s;tor'd.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="301">
One of the great Evils, which lies heavy upon Families now, in this particular Ca&s;e of taking Servants, is the going about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, to take Characters and Re|ports of Servants, or by Word of Mouth; and e&s;pecially among the Ladies this U&s;age prevails, in which the good Nature and Charity of the Ladies to ungrateful Ser|vants, goes &s;o far beyond their Ju&s;tice to one another, that an ill Servant is very &s;eldom detected, and the Ladies yet excu&s;e them&s;elves by this, <HI>namely,</HI> that they are loth to take away a poor Servant's Good-Name, which is &s;tarving them; and that they may perhaps mend, when they come to another Family, what was ami&s;s before, which indeed &s;eldom happens.</P>
<P>This is the Rea&s;on why little is got by &s;uch Enquiries, and the Ladies often run as much Ri&s;que in taking a Servant after &s;uch Enquiries, as if they had not enqui|red at-all; and this is the Rea&s;on why &s;o many Servants get Places again, who have been Whores, Thieves, Drunkards, Swearers, and every-thing that is vile, in the Places where they had &s;erv'd before; and all this while the Ladies are cheating and abu&s;ing one another, in Charity to their <HI>Servants.</HI></P>
<P>It is Time to put an End to this un&s;ea|&s;onable Good-nature; 'tis time to be ju&s;t to your&s;elves, and not to be afraid of &s;peak|ing Truth, for fear of ruining what we call <HI>a Poor Servant:</HI> The Care of not being
<PB N="299" REF="302">
ruin'd, ought to be their own, and they ought to con&s;ider (when they go to Service) that they are upon their Behaviour, for their Lives, and that to mi&s;behave, is to be undone.</P>
<P>Nor wou'd any of the&s;e Severities, <HI>&s;hou'd they be call'd &s;o,</HI> make the Service of good and well-behaving <HI>Servants</HI> at-all the more &s;evere or difficult; becau&s;e &s;uch a <HI>Servant</HI> ill-us'd might always quit with Advantage, and might before a Ju&s;tice obtain a Certifi|cate without any Expence, expre&s;&s;ing the Hard&s;hip they &s;uffer'd, and the Rea&s;on of their coming off.</P>
<P>And after all I might appeal, even to the well-behaving Servants in <HI>England,</HI> to put in their Reque&s;ts, and to tell us, what there is for them either to fear or de&s;ire, which the Laws of <HI>England</HI> do not provide for: It is evident the Grievance is not of the Servants &s;ide; they <HI>do not</HI> really, and in|deed <HI>cannot</HI> complain; they wou'd no doubt be content things &s;hou'd lye ju&s;t as they are, but it cannot be; the Cry is loud again&s;t them, every Part of the Nation complains, and I humbly move the good Hou&s;e-keep|ers of <HI>England,</HI> that they wou'd not now give it over, 'till they &s;ee the Reformation of Family Di&s;cipline effectually made, which I hope the&s;e few Articles wou'd &s;oon bring to pa&s;s: Laws have already been made on the <HI>Servants</HI> &s;ide, for their more ea&s;y ob|taining Ju&s;tice, for the better Recovery of
<PB N="300" REF="303">
Wages, and for obliging Ma&s;ters to perform their Contracts and Covenants; the Ju&s;ti|ces are empower'd to relieve them in the Country, and the Chamberlains and Magi|&s;trates in the Corporations; every poor Apprentice Boy may complain, if he has not Food and Cloaths fitting, and conve|nient, according to his Indentures; and e|very Plowman, and poor Servant-Maid, may complain to the Ju&s;tices of Peace.</P>
<P>Nay, in Favour of faithful and well-be|having Servants, the mo&s;t favourable Law that was ever contriv'd for their Encou|ragement, was pa&s;s'd here in Parliament; <HI>namely,</HI> That every menial Servant, how remote &s;oever from the Place of their Birth, yet remaining but one Year at a Time in the Place they were la&s;t hir'd to, is by that one Year's faithful Service entituled to a Pari&s;h Settlement in the Place; and if any Di&s;a&s;ter happens to them, &s;o as that they are di&s;abled for Service, by Blindne&s;s, Lame|ne&s;s, or otherwi&s;e, the Pari&s;h is oblig'd to take care of, and provide for them, as long as they live, as much as if they had been born there: I doubt few Servants con&s;ider the Favour they enjoy by this Law, at lea&s;tnot 'till they come to want the Help of it.</P>
<P>But on the other-hand, the in&s;olent Ser|vant, without Regard to Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s, to Ju&s;tice or Rea&s;on, packs up, and runs a|way when he plea&s;es, leaves the Husband|man
<PB N="301" REF="304">
in the middle of his Harve&s;t, leaves his Garden in the Prime of the Sea&s;on, leaves the Manufactures in the middle of the Spring Trade; and after having receiv'd his Wages in the Dead of Winter, when there was no Work to be had, flies when the Days grow long, and his Service u&s;eful, and goes abroad where he can get the be&s;t Pay, and for all this the Ma&s;ter has no Remedy.</P>
<P>New Laws therefore &s;eem ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enforce the Obedience of Servants. and oblige them to continue in their Places, according to the Time they re&s;pectively agree for, when they are hir'd: Nothing can ef|fectually do this, but a &s;trict Obliging all Per|&s;ons, whether Gentlemen, or Hu&s;bandmen Artificers, Manufacturers, or whatever they are, who employ Servants, or Day-Labourers, neither to hire or employ any Servant, Work|man, or Labourer, without a Certificate of their being fairly di&s;charg'd, and having ho|ne&s;tly behav'd at the la&s;t Place they work'd at, tho' it was but for one Day.</P>
<P>This Certificate wou'd &s;ecure their Behavi|our every-where; it wou'd be a Pa&s;s to them from Place to Place; it wou'd vindicate them from all Charges on Su&s;picion, either in tra|velling from Place to Place, or &s;topping in any Place in their Way, and &s;o it wou'd be of Service to the travelling Poor, and pre|vent their being wrongfully taken up by Hue and Cry, or other Pur&s;uit, as is often una|voidably their Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="305">
And it wou'd be of Service to the Publick Ju&s;tice, for the more ea&s;y apprehending of Thieves and Vagabonds; for in ca&s;e of Rob|beries, and Mi&s;chief, every hone&s;t Man be|ing furni&s;h'd to give a ready Account of his Station from Place to Place, tho&s;e who were not able to give &s;uch legal Satisfaction, wou'd be immediately taken hold of.</P>
<P>Now therefore is the time for the People of <HI>England</HI> to re&s;cue them&s;elves out of the Hands of the wor&s;t Slavery they were ever yet in, &s;ince <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was re&s;tor'd to them; I mean, a Bondage to their own Ser|vants: For as they &s;ay in <HI>Turkey,</HI> that a Rene|gado is wor&s;e than a <HI>Turk,</HI> and that a Slave makes the wor&s;t <HI>Patroon,</HI> &s;o mu&s;t add, that In&s;olent Servants are the wor&s;t Ma&s;ters.</P>
