<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE King in his Mo&s;t Gracious Speech at the Opening the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament, has been pleas'd to expre&s;s him&s;elf with &s;uch an In|imitable Goodne&s;s and Royal Tenderne&s;s in Behalf of all his People, and in Regard to the Good and Pro|&s;perity of their Trade in particular, that we can|not take our Ri&s;e from a better, and more pro|mi&s;ing Foundation in the Important Ca&s;e now before us.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>In one Part His Maje&s;ty tells us, <HI>That in the Peace now concluded with</HI> Spain, <HI>it was his Fir&s;t Care to con&s;ult the Intere&s;t of his own Subjects, preferable to any other Con&s;ideration.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>In another, <HI>How careful he was that his own Subjects might reap the earlie&s;t Fruits of the Peace.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>&s;aving the Expence of his Subjects is a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure to him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>he looks with Compa&s;&s;ion on the Hard&s;hips of the Artificers and Manufacturers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>the Intere&s;t of his Subjects has been the Rule of all his Actions, and Object of his Wi&s;hes.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In &s;hort, The Whole Speech is full of the mo&s;t Affectionate and Tender Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as truly and perfectly de&s;cribe a Prince fill'd with Thoughts of Goodne&s;s and Beneficence TO, and a true Father OF his People; and who&s;e whole Study and Delight it is, and will always be to make them HAPPY and EASY.,</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The U&s;es I bring all the&s;e Ob&s;ervations to, and the Rea&s;ons of beginning our Work in this Man|ner are the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. We may with infinite Satisfaction promi&s;e our &s;elves, that any rea&s;onable dutiful Application TO, and any Propo&s;al truly Calculated for the Good of our Country, and for the Advantage of its Com|merce, if laid BEFORE his Maje&s;ty in a pro|per Place and Manner, will always meet with a Royal Smile, and be ble&s;s'd with his Favour and Concurrence.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may with the like Satisfaction hope, That this open Declaration of his Maje&s;ty's De&s;ire to propagate the Intere&s;t of his People, and to en|courage their Trade, will in&s;pire the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, with the &s;ame Sentiments, and move them to exert them&s;elves on all Occa&s;ions for delivering the Trading Part of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects from the Grievances and Oppre&s;&s;ions they labour under.</P>
<P>In this View the&s;e Sheets are pre&s;ented to the Publick, being the humble Complaint of the chief Trading Part of the whole Kingdom, again&s;t a Sort of People, who (however unhappily allow'd by the Publick, for the pre&s;ent) are in the Nature of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and e&s;pecially by the Manner of their carrying it on, become an heavy Oppre&s;&s;ion; Ruinous and De&s;tructive to the Pro&s;perity of Trade in general, and Injurious to every fair Trader in particular</P>
<P>All which they find them&s;elves encourag'd as above, to lay before his Maje&s;ty in Parliament, where alone it can be redre&s;s'd.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Excellent Order and Method of carrying on our Home Trade in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> from the fir&s;t Principles or Materials of our Manufactures, to the fini&s;hing of them.</HEAD>
<P>_PRODUCTION and CON|SUMPTION are the Be|ginning and End of all Trade.</P>
<P>The Materials produc'd, whether they are the Pro|duction of Nature or Art, are the SUBJECT of Trade.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e Productions thro' the &s;everal working Hands, nece&s;&s;ary for their
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Improvement, or to their &s;everal Markets for Sale, is not improperly called the CIRCU|LATION of Trade.</P>
<P>The admirable Order of this Circulation of Trade is a mo&s;t agreeable Speculation.</P>
<P>It is an Inquiry not unworthy the mo&s;t Exalted Genius, not below the mo&s;t Superior Dignity.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;es of it are found in the Nature of the Thing, and the Con&s;equences of it, in the Wealth and Pro&s;perity of the Whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>How the meane&s;t Trifles accumulate a Va|lue, as they pa&s;s from Hand to Hand: How they become Important, Rich, U&s;eful, and Beautiful, by the Addition of Time, Labour, and the Improvement of Art; and how the meane&s;t Labourer or Mechanick contributes by unwearied Application, to fini&s;h (in a mere Road of in&s;tructed Workman&s;hip) tho&s;e Beauties in Nature, which even he him&s;elf does not at all under&s;tand.</P>
<P>As in a Piece of the fine&s;t Clock-Work, we find each Man working on his di&s;tinct Part to the greate&s;t Perfection; yet the Beau|ties are not &s;een till the whole Frame is form'd by another Agent; which Agent al&s;o can no more perform the &s;eparate Parts, than the &s;e|parate Workmen can the Whole.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of this Oeconomy in Trade is not all; for Speculation is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s here: But this Circulation is the e&s;&s;ential vi|tal
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Part of the Pro&s;perity of our Commerce, and e&s;pecially of our Home Trade in this Nation; and as &s;uch it becomes the ju&s;t Con|cern of every Lover of his Country.</P>
<P>Every Head and Hand ought to be em|ploy'd to Pre&s;erve, Support, Enlarge, and En|crea&s;e it, as the main Thing on which the Health of Trade depends; and in the Decay, Shortning or Contracting of which, our Trade mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily Langui&s;h, Droop, and Die; and this brings us down directly, and without any Circumlocutions or Explana|tions, to the Ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>This Beautiful Scheme of Trade as de|&s;crihed in all its Circulating Meanders, of which we &s;hall &s;peak in their Place, has of a long Time &s;uffered a Decay; it has felt &s;trange Shocks and Convul&s;ions, and met with great Ob&s;tructions among us, and that of many Kinds, and from many &s;everal Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Particularly it has been attack'd by open E|nemies, who have even endanger'd the Whole Oeconomy, and do &s;till threaten &s;omething fatal to us, if timely Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance be not obtained, and the Evils removed by &s;ome powerful Succour of Laws and Government; and this is, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> the Sum and Sub&s;tance of the Ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>The Circulation of Trade, (to go back to what has been laid down above,) takes in all the &s;everal Progre&s;&s;ions, which our Produce or Manufactures make in their ordinary
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Cour&s;e, from the fir&s;t Principles of Trade, to the Retailer who hands them on to the Con|&s;umer.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every thing that is Sold, whether it be the Product of Nature or Art, pa&s;&s;es thro' a great Variety of Hands, and &s;ome Variety of Operations al&s;o, before it becomes (what we call) fit for Sale.</P>
<P>Even our very Provi&s;ions, which may be &s;aid to make the lea&s;t Stop, and pa&s;s thro' the fewe&s;t Hands, yet are trac'd thro' &s;everal, before they come to the Con&s;umer: For Example,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our <HI>Fle&s;h-Meat;</HI> the Cattle are fir&s;t Bred, then Fed, then Driven to one Fair or Market, then to another, then Sold to the Butcher, and then to the Eater. In every one of tho&s;e Circulating Removes, the Breeder, Feeder, Drover, Butcher, with their Cattle, Hor&s;es, Servants, and Families, are &s;everally maintain'd by, and get a &s;mall Share of Pro|fits from the Creature Sold; and which is at la&s;t charg'd upon, and return'd from the Price of the Meat when kill'd, and Bought by the Con&s;umer.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Corn,</HI> as &s;uppo&s;e the Wheat; here is fir&s;t, the Farmer, who rai&s;es the Crop, (not to mention the Landed-Man,) the Plough, the Seed, the Harve&s;ting, and the carrying it to Market, is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Farmer; but under him it pa&s;&s;es all the Ope|rations of the Hor&s;es, the Servants, the Car|riages,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
and &s;everal other things included in that Part call'd Husbandry; and for the Sup|port of which &s;everal other Trade&s;men are concern'd; &s;uch as the Smith, the Wheel|wright, the Collar and Harne&s;s-maker, the Tanner, and many others; all who&s;e Fami|lies find their Sub&s;i&s;tance out of the mere Husbandry, (&s;o it is very properly called) of the Corn. But when all that is over, it pa&s;|&s;es another whole Cla&s;s of Operators, before it comes to the end of its Circulating Race. 1. It is carry'd to the Mill to be Ground; under that Head comes in the Mill-wright, &s;everal Trade&s;men furni&s;hing the Timber, the Iron-work, and Bra&s;s-work for the Mill; the Mill&s;tones out of <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> or from <HI>France.</HI> The Carriage of tho&s;e heavy Articles and all the Etcetera's depending thereon.</P>
<P>Then the Dre&s;&s;ing, the Grinding for Fine or Coar&s;e; then it pa&s;&s;es one Sale at lea&s;t to the Baker, then 'tis bak'd into Bread its la&s;t Operation, and pa&s;&s;es many depending Hands upon that Account.</P>
<P>2. The Second Branch of Corn is the <HI>Bar|ley;</HI> this is fir&s;t Sold to the Mal&s;ter; then Malted, then Sold again (perhaps more than once) then Brew'd, pays Exci&s;e, and is dou|bly Gauged in the Malt and in the Liquor; then &s;old to the Victualler and Innholder, and then to the Con&s;umer; in all which Motions nece&s;&s;ary to their Sale, the &s;everal Trade&s;men thro' who&s;e Hands they pa&s;s, with their Ser|vants,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Hor&s;es, and Families, and many others depending upon them, e&s;pecially in the Brew|ing and Malting, gain a Maintenance out of the increa&s;ing Value, and live by the Profits of their Trade; and the like of other Sorts of Provi&s;ions, &s;ome of which come from the Growth to the Mouth with a &s;horter, &s;ome with a larger Circulation.</P>
<P>But &s;etting the&s;e Kinds a&s;ide, which <HI>(as we &s;ay)</HI> come thus under a &s;horter Operation, becau&s;e the Species differ exceedingly, when we come to &s;peak of the Productions of Art, that is to &s;ay, the Manufactures: Here we find an innumerable Multitude of Families concerned in and maintained by them, the &s;everal Kinds of their Manual Operation are numberle&s;s, and the Operators are much more &s;o; the Produce of Nature is indeed the <HI>Materia Fabricata</HI> of all Manufactures, but the Improvements of Art give a new Face to the very Species, &s;o that you know it no more either by its Form, or by its Name.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;mutation is performed by an infinite Number of People; the Wooll which bears every where the &s;ame Denomination at fir&s;t, retains its Name but a very little while, and its Form le&s;s; after its fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ing the <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> or the <HI>Comb</HI> it comes to the Spinner, and is then no more call'd Wooll but Yarn; from thence to the Weaver, and there it a&s;&s;umes as many Shapes as Names, and is called Cloth, Stuff, Serge, Drugget, Bay,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Say, and a numberle&s;s Catalogue of Deno|minations, as the Fancy of the &s;everal Clothiers and Manufacturers plea&s;e to Coin for it.</P>
<P>While it is in the Hands of the Weaver and continues rough and undre&s;t, it retains the Shape of the Yarn both in the Woof and the Warp, which are vi&s;ible in the Stuff, let the Kind be what it will: But when it has pa&s;t the Fuller's Art, and been hurried into a violent Motion in the <HI>Thicking-Mill,</HI> it comes out with another Face; and being then dre&s;s'd under the Sheets and the Pre&s;s, we &s;ee no more the Thread, but a fine and beautiful Face, &s;et forth to all po&s;&s;ible Advantage by the Cloath-workers Art.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to give the Detail in the narrow Compa&s;s of this Work, of all the &s;e|veral Sorts of Workmen, their Engines, Mills, Looms, and other Tackle, with the &s;everal Operations, through which our Woollen Ma|nufactures pa&s;s, before they come to Market, or before, <HI>as the Trade&s;men call it,</HI> they are fit for Sale. All which Workmen, as well as the Makers of all the Engines, Looms, Mills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with their Families and Depen|dants, are maintain'd, fed, cloath'd, (nay, enrich'd) by the &s;aid Manufactures, and out of the advanc'd Value which they bear with them when they go to Market: The Variety is &s;uch, That &s;ome undertake to tell us, there is not a Broad-Cloth that goes to
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<HI>Blackwell-Hall,</HI> but that 10,000 People have &s;omething to do, by the Means of it, and all get &s;omething out of it before it comes there.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame with the Silk Manufacture in its Degree, with this Difference only, that there are a numberle&s;s Multitude of People concerned in the Silk, before it comes to us: Several Trades are maintained by tho&s;e particular Articles of Commerce, which are nece&s;&s;arily run thro' before the Workmen can come at the fir&s;t Principles of this Manu|facture, <HI>I mean the Raw or Thrown-Silk;</HI> it does not immediately come thither from the Worm that &s;pins or makes it, but pa&s;&s;es many a Climate, travels many a De&s;art, employs many a Hand, loads many a Camel, and Freights many a Ship before it arrives here; and where at la&s;t it comes in return for other Manufactures, or in Exchange for our Money.</P>
<P>Again, even the Money as it is a Foreign Specie, is it &s;elf al&s;o a Merchandize; is a Return for other Trade, and pa&s;&s;es thro' many Thou&s;ands of Hands, in the Mine, in the Coin, in the Navigation, and all the other <HI>Apparatus</HI> of its Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> before it reaches thus far, and before it can purcha&s;e and pay for the Species which begins the Silk Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
It is the like in all our <HI>hard Ware</HI> Ma|nufactures; whether in Iron, Tin, Cop|per, Lead, Gold, Silver, or what other Specie they may be; &s;ome of the Metal is found in our own Mountains, &s;ome in tho&s;e of <HI>Spain, Africa, Sweden, Denmark, India</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>To bring this all to the &s;ame Point; With what admirable Skill and Dexterity, do the proper Arti&s;ts apply to the differing Shares or Tasks allotted to them, by the Nature of their &s;everal Employments, in forming all the beautiful Things which are produced from tho&s;e differing Principles? Thro' how many Hands does every Species pa&s;s? What a Va|riety of Figures do they Form? In how many Shapes do they appear? From the Bra&s;s Can|non of 50 to 60 hundred Weight, to half an Inch of Bra&s;s Wire, called <HI>a Pin,</HI> all equally u&s;eful in their Place and Proportions?</P>
<P>On the other Hand, how does even the lea&s;t Pin contribute its namele&s;s Proportion to the Maintenance, Profit, and Support of every Hand, and every Family concerned in tho&s;e Operations, from the Copper Mine in <HI>Africa,</HI> to the Retailer's-Shop in the Country Village, however remote? And this brings us down to the Circulation of the Manufactures, in that we call the buying and &s;elling Part, as well Whole&s;ale as Retale; which I refer to a Chapter by it &s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Circulation of the Inland Trade, after the fini&s;hing the &s;everal Ma|nufactures in remote and different Places.</HEAD>
<P>THE Country is ordinarily the Seat of the Manufactures, there they a&s;|&s;ume their fir&s;t Being, as a marketable Species.</P>
<P>It is true the City has of late Years en|croacht a little, and we find a very great Stroke of the Manufacturing Trade carried on here, e&s;pecially in <HI>Spittle-fields</HI> and Parts adjacent: <HI>But of that by it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e every Manufacture form'd in its proper Place, every Trade run|ning in its right Channel.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The fine <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths and Druggets, are made in <HI>Wilt&s;hire, Somer&s;et&s;hire, Bark|&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Serges, Duroys, Perpets, and Long-Ells, in <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Stuffs of many Sorts, Camblets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at <HI>Norwich.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Tammies and Callamancoes, at <HI>Co|ventry.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="15" REF="14">
The Stockings knit in Frames, at <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Nottingham.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Narrow-Cloth, Ker&s;ies, and Shalloons, in <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> and &s;o of all the other Kinds of Goods called Woollen Manufactures in their &s;everal particular Parts.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e, I &s;ay, all fini&s;hed and made ready for Sale, in the &s;everal Places or Counties as above, or any where el&s;e, and re&s;ting in the Hands of the <HI>Ma&s;ter-Maker,</HI> or Manufacturer, ordinarily called a Clo|thier.</P>
<P>That he may put them off, and they may be &s;old to the proper Per&s;ons, who are to u&s;e or wear them, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have them &s;ent to Market: This Market Occa&s;ions &s;eve|ral very Extraordinary Removes, which when particularly mentioned will naturally de&s;cribe the Circulation &s;poken of above.</P>
<P>Nature and the Cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s has made <HI>London</HI> the Chief or Principal Market, for all the&s;e things call'd Manufactures, not tho&s;e above &s;pecify'd only, but all the re&s;t: And it is ea&s;y to &s;how, 1. That there mu&s;t be &s;uch a Chief or Principal Market. And 2. That it is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be the Place.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be &s;uch a Chief Market, becau&s;e as the Manufactures and Trade&s;men in the Country have much to &s;ell; that is to &s;ay, more than le&s;&s;er and
<PB N="16" REF="15">
meaner Towns can take off, &s;o they have by them&s;elves, and their Corre&s;pondents in the Country much to buy; that is to &s;ay, more than any le&s;s Capital Port and Market, or a Place of le&s;s General Corre&s;pondence could &s;upply, nothing le&s;s than <HI>London</HI> could an&s;wer the Ends of a Whole&s;ale Trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. This proves al&s;o that <HI>London</HI> mu&s;t be the Place: The Merchants of <HI>London</HI> carrying on a general Corre&s;pondence with all the World, are able to vend the Quantity of Manufactures, which the Clothiers &s;end up, be it never &s;o great and this they do by the Bulk of their Exportation; They are al&s;o able to &s;upply the Carriers with Back-Carriage, from the Bulk of their Importations, and thus they &s;pread and circulate the Growth of Foreign Countries in return for our own.</P>
<P>This no &s;ingle Town, City, or Sea-Port in <HI>England</HI> can do, <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> excepted; nor can <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> do it &s;o univer&s;ally as <HI>London;</HI> for this Rea&s;on the Manufacturers every where in the Country, will &s;end their Goods to <HI>London,</HI> becau&s;e here their Carriers can have a Back-Carriage; without which they cannot travel. Here they (the Clothiers) and the Shopkeepers their Neighbours, can buy all the &s;everal Kinds of Foreign Importations from what Part of the World &s;oever they come, which can no where el&s;e be done, at lea&s;t not at fir&s;t Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
And which goes yet farther, &s;uch is the Wealth, and &s;o great the Stocks of the <HI>London</HI> Dealers; That here the Makers can have Money for their Manufactures, and here they and the Shopkeepers al&s;o, can have Credit, and that to a Degree, which no other Place can give; they can always &s;ell for Money, and general|ly buy without; take Credit, and give none; nor is it boa&s;ting in Behalf of the Citizens and Whole&s;ale Men of <HI>London,</HI> to &s;ay, That the Shopkeepers in the Country (generally &s;peaking) trade upon their Stocks.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons which &s;e|cure the gro&s;s of the Trade to <HI>London,</HI> and will do &s;o tho' the Grievances and Di&s;courage|ments which we are now to complain of, tend to le&s;&s;en and impair it; here the main Stream will run as to the Center, as the Rivers to the Ocean, and as the Blood to the Heart; and it is certainly for the Health of the whole Body of Trade, that it &s;hould be &s;o, and the Proof of that is as evident as the other.</P>
<P>By this &s;ending up the fini&s;hed Manufa|ctures in bulk to the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the Country Shopkeepers buying their Goods from thence in Return, the following Advan|tages follow to the general Body of the Peo|ple of <HI>England, (viz.)</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="17">
1. All that innumerable Number of Car|riages, Hor&s;es, and Servants, with all the nece&s;&s;ary Appendices of Land Carriage which &s;uch a Trade calls for are main|tain'd. It is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Work to make Calculations of Numbers, but it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to give the Reader a clear View of the Benefit and Gain of the &s;everal Branches of our circulating Trade; that he may have a like clear View of the injurious Con&s;equence of tho&s;e New Methods of Trade which would de&s;troy it.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the Carriage is prodigious great, as well by Land as Water (for it is the fir&s;t we are now &s;peaking of) &s;o the Number of Inns and Publick-hou&s;es are incredible, which are now to be &s;een, not only in the Towns and Cities, but every where on the Roads, where tho&s;e Carriers and Travellers pa&s;s: All the&s;e are chiefly maintain'd by tho&s;e Carriages, and by the Men and Hor&s;es which travel conti|nually for the carrying on the general Cor|re&s;pondence too and from <HI>London:</HI> Their Number is really prodigious.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Increa&s;e of Trade among tho&s;e Inns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and by their Means the Con&s;umption of Fodder, Hay, Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Provi&s;ions of all Sorts is unaccountably great, and the Be|nefit of it to the landed Intere&s;t, is a Specu|lation worth the Notice of all Gentlemen of E&s;tates throughout <HI>England.</HI> They feel mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly the Benefit of this Circulation; they
<PB N="19" REF="18">
are ea&s;ily made &s;en&s;ible what the Benefit to Trade is, that <HI>London</HI> is able to furni&s;h a back Carriage by Shopkeepers Goods (as they are called) &s;uch as Grocery, Oyl, Wine, Fruit, and in a Word, all Goods of Foreign Importation; without this, how would the <HI>Sheffield</HI> and <HI>Birmingham</HI> Carriers bring up their wrought Iron, Things of a heavy Car|riage? How would the <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> People bring up their Chee&s;e? The <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Men their coar&s;e Cloths? The Manufacturers of <HI>Exeter, Taunton, Norwich, Wilts, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter</HI> their fine Goods? They mu&s;t all come the dearer to Market.</P>
<P>No more (on the other Hand) could the Ci|tizens of <HI>London</HI> &s;upply the Country Chap|men with Foreign Goods, without a double Charge for Carriage, which would make the Price &s;o much the dearer to the Buyer; &s;o that this Circulation is an Alternative to Trade, the Country is a Help to the City, and the City is a Help to the Country; as a <HI>French</HI> Proverb expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>One Hand wa&s;hes t'other Hand, and both Hands wa&s;h the Face.</HI></P>
<P>Unhappy Creatures mu&s;t they be, who&s;e Station in Life, by the Fate of their own ill Policy is placed in the mid&s;t of this Stream, to intercept the Cour&s;e of the Trade in its na|tural Channels, and where it circulates &s;o apt|ly for the Good of the Whole, and who would cut &s;hort the Means of its doing good to the whole Community.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Manner of carrying on the Re|tale Trade, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the City of <HI>London,</HI> in all the mo&s;t di|&s;tant Parts of this Kingdom.</HEAD>
<P>BY this admirable Oeconomy of Trade, Bu&s;ine&s;s is extended into the remote&s;t Parts of the Kingdom; Shops are opened in every Pari&s;h, nay, in every Village and Hamlet. The&s;e &s;maller Shops diffu&s;e and &s;pread not the Manufactures of the remote&s;t Part of the Country only, but the Product and imported Growth of Foreign Countries and Kingdoms, into every Corner of the I&s;land; where they are all &s;old by Retale, to
<PB N="21" REF="20">
the particular Families and Inhabitants of their Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>By this Means the Tea of <HI>China,</HI> the Cof|fee of <HI>Arabia,</HI> the Chocolate of <HI>America,</HI> the Spices of the <HI>Molucca's,</HI> the Sugars of the <HI>Caribees,</HI> and the Fruit of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> I&s;lands, are all to be found in the remote&s;t Corners of <HI>England, Scotland, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> By this Method al&s;o, all the &s;everal Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> tho' made in the mo&s;t different and the remote&s;t Counties, are to be bought in every Place, all being &s;upplied from the great Center of the Nations Commerce, the City of <HI>London.</HI> The rea&s;on of mention|ing this, &s;hall appear pre&s;ently; let us look a little fir&s;t into the Con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e little Retaling Shops are the Life of all our Trade; by tho&s;e the Bulk of the Bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on to the la&s;t Con&s;umer, and here all the Whole&s;ale Trade, as well of Home Manufactures as Foreign Importations is terminated and fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The People that keep the&s;e Shops are &s;up|lied at the like Trade&s;mens Shops, in the larger Towns or Cities, according as Situation directs; the Keepers of tho&s;e Shops being &s;uppo&s;ed to have larger Stocks, and &s;o are able to give the&s;e le&s;&s;er Dealers &s;ome Credit: Again, the Shop-keepers in tho&s;e greater Towns are furni&s;hed by the Whole&s;ale Men, (who are &s;uch as we call Country Dealers in <HI>London,</HI> who likewi&s;e give Credit to tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Chapmen in the principal Towns in the Country.</P>
<P>The&s;e Whole&s;ale Men in <HI>London</HI> are indeed the &s;upport of the whole Trade, they give Credit to the Country Trade&s;men (Chapmen) and even to the Merchants them&s;elves; &s;o that both Home Trade and Foreign Trade is in a great Mea&s;ure carried on upon their Stocks.</P>
<P>To the&s;e Men, or to the Factors and Warehou&s;e Men, of whom the&s;e Dealers buy, all the Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> in what&s;o|ever Part of the Country they are made, are &s;ent up to <HI>London</HI> for Sale, and from <HI>Lon|don</HI> circulated again as above, into all the remote&s;t Parts among the Shop-keepers; and by them in Retale Trade to the Wearers and Con&s;umers.</P>
<P>It is on the&s;e Retalers, that all the People of <HI>England</HI> depend for the Supply of common Nece&s;&s;aries, whether for Food, Cloths, Hou|&s;hold-Stuff, Ornament, or whatever el&s;e they think fit to lay their Money out in; even the Clothier him&s;elf cannot Cloth him&s;elf, or the Farmer feed him&s;elf or Family without them.</P>
<P>The Farmer may have Corn &s;ufficient, and Cattle &s;ufficient for the Supply of his Fami|ly: But when he comes to kill them for Food, he &s;ends to the Shopkeeper for Salt, or the Beef will &s;poil before he can u&s;e it; he mu&s;t &s;end to the Shop for Fruit, for Spice,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
for Sugar, to &s;upply his Wife in her Kitchen; he mu&s;t &s;end to another Shop for Pewter and Bra&s;s for his Kitchen-Uten&s;ils, to the Smith for Spits and Jack, Iron-Pots, and the like of other things; and all this, tho' the Iron, Tin, Copper, and the Salt are the Growth of his own Country, for they do not grow at his own Door, and the Mines are not in his Farm; nor are the Manufacturers of Hard-Ware, the Smiths of <HI>Sheffield</HI> and <HI>Birmingham</HI> at his Door; the Ca&s;ters of Iron, Tin or Lead, do not live in his Town, &s;o he mu&s;t &s;end to the Shopkeepers for all tho&s;e Things, as he wants them. The Shop|keeper for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, mu&s;t have them from <HI>London;</HI> for if he would &s;end to <HI>Sheffield</HI> or to <HI>Birmingham</HI> for them, he could find no Carriers to bring them; and if they did, he had nothing to load them back with, &s;o that the Goods would co&s;t him double Carriage: Of this al&s;o we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak again.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Clothiers, they are mo&s;t Importent Men in their Way; &s;peaking of them in general Terms, we &s;ay they are able to cloth the whole World. But it mu&s;t be taken with a due Latitude, for them and their Neighbours; for there is not a Clothier in <HI>England</HI> that can Cloath him&s;elf; nay, he cannot make him&s;elf a Coat, take him in what Country you will; he can indeed make
<PB N="24" REF="23">
the Out-&s;ide, and he can call for a Taylor, who is every where at hand to make it up.</P>
<P>But even the Taylor him&s;elf mu&s;t &s;end to the Shop for Silk and Thread to &s;ew it toge|ther; and for even Needles and a Thimble, or he will make but poor Work; he mu&s;t &s;end to another Shop for Sheers and Si&s;&s;ars to cut out with, and the like.</P>
<P>Then for the Clothier him&s;elf when he has made the Cloth, he mu&s;t buy Shalloon, or perhaps &s;ome other Manufacture made 150 Miles off for a Lining; he mu&s;t have Buttons out of <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> about <HI>Macclesfield;</HI> Dimity to line the Wa&s;tcoat out of <HI>Manche&s;ter;</HI> Linnen to line the Breeches, out of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and a Hundred little namele&s;s things; &s;ome out of one County, &s;ome out of another, before the Clothier can be clothed; his Hat comes from one Place, Stockings from another, Gloves from a Third; and &s;o on, all tho&s;e he &s;ends to the Shop-keeper for, and the Shop-keeper to the <HI>London</HI> Whole&s;ale Man, and he to the &s;everal Counties, where tho&s;e &s;everal things are, the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Place; and thus we &s;ee the City mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be the Center of the Trade; for the <HI>London</HI> Dealer has every Sort of Goods brought up by the proper Carriers, and he enables tho&s;e Carriers to bring them up cheap; becau&s;e he or the Dealers in other Goods which the Shop-keepers in that Coun|try call for, can load them back and &s;o get the Carrier a double Freight.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
We might enquire here into the probable Number of the&s;e Shopkeepers in the &s;everal Countries all over this I&s;land, thereby farther to illu&s;trate this Argument, and judge of the Importance of this Circulation of Trade.</P>
<P>But the Thing is impracticable, it is out of the reach of all Calculation, it is enough to &s;ay they are in their Particulars innume|rable, and may only be talk'd off by Thou|&s;ands and Hundreds of Thou&s;ands; for taking them with their real Dependencies, they include almo&s;t the whole Body of our People.</P>
<P>This will &s;erve to &s;top the Mouths of all tho&s;e who having no other <HI>Plea</HI> to bring in Favour of the <HI>Hawkers</HI> and <HI>private Traders,</HI> tho&s;e Enemies to all fair Trade, would move us to Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion for them on Account of their great Numbers: Whereas they do not reflect how infinitely more numerous the Fa|milies of the Shopkeepers, Manufacturers, and Whole&s;ale Dealers are, who they injure, and may be &s;aid to &s;tarve and reduce; and how numerous the Poor are who depend on tho&s;e fair Traders for Employment and Sub|&s;i&s;tence, and who all cry to them for their Bread. Here Compa&s;&s;ion ought to work, the&s;e we &s;hould turn our Eyes to, and not to the other who eat them up and devour them, and who either for their Numbers of &s;ignifi|cance are not to be named with them.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall &s;ee the Importance of them very di&s;tinctly, by looking into the Mi&s;chiefs which we already feel by the Breaches made in this

excellent Oeconomy, and the Ruin which threatens us if it be not &s;peedily prevented, and this is the Subject of the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. That all this Home Trade is interrup|ted and di&s;tre&s;s'd by the Inva&s;ion of <HI>Hawkers, Pedlars,</HI> and other <HI>Clan|de&s;tine Traders</HI>; the Circulation &s;topt, and the <HI>Retaling Shopkeepers,</HI> who are the Life of the Whole Trade intercepted and &s;upplanted.</HEAD>
<P>AVARICE mask'd with a Pretence of Frugality, is the mo&s;t fatal Snare of a Trade&s;man; it leads him not into Mi&s;chiefs only which are Per&s;onal, and which wound him&s;elf, but it pu&s;hes him upon Mea&s;ures ruinous to Trade in general, and &s;o he becomes an Enemy to his Country, and envies the Pro&s;perity of all about him.</P>
<P>He &s;ees Trade run on in a happy Round of Buying and Selling, Importing and Exporting, Carrying up and Carrying down, and that all the Way as it pa&s;&s;es, tho' thro' a Multitude of Hands, it leaves &s;omething of Gain every where behind it, and yet le&s;&s;ens not the Va|lue of what it carries on; and looking on this Beautiful Order of the Trade <HI>with an</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="26">
<HI>evil Eye,</HI> he projects to cut off the Progre&s;s of Things from their Natural Cour&s;e; &s;hor|ten the length of the Circulation, which is indeed the Life of the Whole, and thinking to put all the Gain of Five or Six Stages of the Trade, into his own Pocket, he contrives or at lea&s;t pretends to carry the Goods a &s;horter Way to the la&s;t Con&s;umer; &s;o bringing Things to an immediate Period, making him|&s;elf the Carrier, Factor, Whole&s;ale-Dealer, Chapman, and Retailer all in one Hand, put|ting the Gain of all tho&s;e Trades into the &s;in|gle Pur&s;e of a Pedlar; and this is the Man we are now to &s;peak of.</P>
<P>His Original as above is founded in Ava|rice and Envy, and the Mea&s;ures he pur&s;ues, tells us, that it is his Trade to be a Supplanter; He acts like a Man that maliciou&s;ly turns the Stream of a Mill-River to his own private U&s;e, perhaps tri&s;ling and mean; valuing not the &s;tarving twenty Mills which lie on the &s;ame Stream and mu&s;t get their Bread, and the Sub&s;i&s;tence of their Families, by the fair Pro|duce of their Labour.</P>
<P>In this he acts like a Thief and De&s;troyer, not only to the Trade in general, an Invader and Pirate to the fair Trader in particular, but at the &s;ame Time is a Cheat to the Buyers and Con&s;umers of the Goods he &s;ells; and in the whole to him&s;elf; for he defeats his own Expectations, and generally dies a Beggar, all which we doubt not to make appear to the meane&s;t Under&s;tanding in the Proce&s;s of the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
At an unhappy Juncture of Time, when FUNDS for rai&s;ing Money to the Govern|ment were wretchedly wanting, and at a Time when the Fair Traders &s;tood in need of all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement, to enable them to pay the great Taxes which they then began to feel the Weight of; at that very Time, and we may &s;ay, in <HI>an Evil Hour,</HI> a Project to licence the&s;e Pernitious People was propo&s;ed, and for a trifling Payment, compar'd to the fatal Ef|fects of it to Trade, was clo&s;ed with, and the &s;aid Licences granted. We call it a tri|fling Payment, becau&s;e it &s;eems to be &s;o, not only by Compari&s;on as above, but by the &s;mall Sums it brings in to the Publick.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince that Time they have been like Moths in Trade, and have eaten into the ve|ry Vitals of our Commerce, in a fatal and mo&s;t injurious Manner; encroaching upon the <HI>Fair Traders,</HI> almo&s;t in every Branch of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, where the Goods they &s;ell are light and portable; &s;preading them&s;elves into all Parts of the Country as well as City; in&s;inuating into the Opinion of the Ignorant, by noto|rious Fal&s;hoods and Sugge&s;tions; particularly that they have their Goods from the Makers, buy them at the be&s;t hand, have the be&s;t of every thing in its Kind, and to &s;um up all, that they &s;ell every thing at a cheaper Rate, than they (the Buyer) can be &s;upply'd at by the Shops; all which in every Particular we take upon us to prove are downright Fal&s;|hoods,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
calculated on Purpo&s;e to deceive and and impo&s;e upon the ignorant Buyer: And in a Word, That their whole Trade is a &s;tated and premeditated Fraud, that it is &s;o in the very Nature and Method of it, as well as in the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>If then in the Proce&s;s of this Work we &s;how, as we doubt not to do, that they nei|ther buy at the be&s;t Hand, are furni&s;hed with the be&s;t Goods, nor are able to &s;ell the be&s;t cheap; we hope there will be no Difficulty to convince the Honourable Per&s;ons, to whom we addre&s;s the&s;e Sheets, that they are a People pernitious in them&s;elves, and that they ought to be &s;uppre&s;t.</P>
<P>It may look like making room for an Ob|jection here, to &s;ay that the&s;e Men do not buy, and cannot &s;ell cheaper than the fair trading Shopkeepers; for then it may be &s;aid, what hurt can they do to Trade?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer is very plain and direct, <HI>(viz.)</HI> 1. That they pretend too, and loudly affirm the contrary, and &s;o abu&s;e the ignorant Buyers; they intercept the Trade, they turn the Stream from the Mill, <HI>as was ob|&s;erved above,</HI> they invert the due Order and Cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s; for in&s;tead of the Cu&s;tomers going to the Shop, they carry the Shop to the Cu&s;tomers; in&s;tead of the Coun|try Inhabitants frequenting the Markets, which are the proper Places of Trade, they make the Markets walk about to the Inha|bitants,
<PB N="30" REF="29">
calling upon them at their Doors; where if the People get nothing el&s;e, they are gratified by &s;aving them the Trouble of going out of Doors to the Shops, or to the Market Towns; (which in &s;ome Ca&s;es is to them a thing of Con&s;equence, as Di&s;tance and Situa|tion of Places may be) and if it were no more than this, the Shopkeeper is &s;upplanted and cut out of the Trade, and all the Chap|men and Dealers between him and the <HI>Lon|don</HI> Whole&s;ale Men, are likewi&s;e cut out of their Bu&s;ine&s;s in their Proportion.</P>
<P>We might enlarge here upon the fatal Con|&s;equences of thus cutting off the Country Shopkeepers from their Bu&s;ine&s;s, intercepting Trade, and ob&s;tructing its regular Cour&s;e, the Nece&s;&s;ity of which for the publick Pro|&s;perity, we have &s;o largely in&s;i&s;ted upon above, how by that Means &s;o many Thou&s;ands of Families are &s;upplanted in their Trades, open their Shops in vain, and are left de&s;titute; But we leave that to its proper Place.</P>
<P>It is needful fir&s;t to take the&s;e People in their own Way, and lay open a little the Fraud which they u&s;e in their ordinary Cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s: How the People in the Countries (ay and in the City too) are impos'd upon by them; and when we have detected them in their known Cheats, we &s;hall have the clearer View of the fatal Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Cheats in Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">
FAIR DEALING is the Honour of Trade, and the Credit of the Trade&s;man; a Shopkeeper may perhaps run out &s;ometimes in Words, for the &s;etting out his Goods, (and the Buyer in running him down, and not believing Truth in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner expre&s;t, is really the principal Cau&s;e of all tho&s;e Excur&s;ions of Words, which the Shop|keeper is as it were under a Nece&s;&s;ity of ma|king) But the&s;e People can &s;peak no other Dialect; Truth is out of their way; their Bu&s;ine&s;s will not bear it; their Trade is a Fraud in it &s;elf, and mu&s;t be &s;upported by Fal&s;hood, and if they &s;hould at any Time de|viate into Sincerity, they would be kick'd out of Doors; they can Trade no longer than they can L&mdash;e, for the very Beginning and End of their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to deceive. Let us look a little into the Particulars,</P>
<P N="1">1. That they buy their Goods at the be&s;t Hand. This even in it &s;elf is fal&s;e, and known to be &s;o; for we &s;ee them every Day in the Shops and Warehou&s;es of the Whole|&s;ale Dealers, in all Places where the Country Chapmen deal, and where they buy indeed what the others leave, which leads of Cour&s;e to the next Pretence, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That they buy the be&s;t Goods, which is as fal&s;e as the other; for it is well known that they buy the wor&s;t and meane&s;t Goods of the &s;everal Kinds they deal in, and par|ticularly that which the Country Chapmen
<PB N="32" REF="31">
refu&s;e; nor indeed will the Whole&s;ale Dealers; where they are Men of Hone&s;ty, and have the Sen&s;e of their own Intere&s;t, as well as of Ju&s;tice in Trade, &s;ell to &s;uch People as tho&s;e the be&s;t of their Goods, which are lay'd in to &s;upply their con&s;tant Chapmen, who buy large Quantities, and Merit to be u&s;ed well; nor does the Pedlars bringing his ready Money weigh in this Ca&s;e; for the Country Chapman who as above, deals largely and con&s;tantly, and pays well, Merits to be u&s;ed as well, and indeed better than a Hawking Clande&s;tine Trader, who brings his Money becau&s;e he has no Credit; and pays down, becau&s;e he cannot buy without it, who runs about from Warehou&s;e to Warehou&s;e to pick out any thing for the &s;ake of Cheapne&s;s, and is fixt no where: The Warehou&s;e Men will never &s;how the&s;e their be&s;t Goods. They know al&s;o, 1. They are not for their Turn. And, 2. They will not give a Price for them, and in this Manner the Pedlars &s;tock them|&s;elves with Goods.</P>
<P>Let us View them next upon their Circuits in the Country, for &s;elling them off: It is true they travel as we call it cheap, that they feed their Hor&s;e upon the <HI>Wa&s;te</HI> and them&s;elves upon the <HI>Spoil,</HI> that they lodge at the mean|e&s;t Hou&s;es and in the meane&s;t Places, where they live like them&s;elves, that is, wretchedly and at little or no Expence, and this indeed is one ju&s;t Article again&s;t their being &s;uffered
<PB N="33" REF="32">
in Trade for at the &s;ame time, that they &s;up|plant the e&s;tabli&s;h'd &s;ettled Shopkeepers, who as above are the Supports of the whole Body, maintain both Church and State, the Civil and Religious Government, feed the Poor, and cloth the Rich: The&s;e People do nothing in Civil Government, pay for nothing, bear no Offices, rai&s;e no Taxes, and which is &s;till more, pay no Rent, for they have no Hou&s;es nor legal Settlement: They pay neither Scot or Lot, Church or Poor, but in &s;hort, are compleat Vagrants; and ought, their late unhappy Advantage excepted, to be treated as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, take them with all the&s;e Advantages, it is not true in Fact, that they can carry their Goods cheaper in Bulk than the Shopkeeper can have them carried, and the Rea&s;on is very plain, becau&s;e the Carriers by having con&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s back|ward, &s;hall deliver Goods one kind with another, at a cheaper Rate, than even the Ped|lar him&s;elf can carry them; and if we allow for Carriage by Water, whether by Sea or River Navigation, much cheaper.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Argument is again&s;t him in his Selling for le&s;s Profit than the Shopkeeper, which is al&s;o a Mi&s;take; becau&s;e the Shop|keeper out does him in Quantity, which makes up the Profit in the whole to him, tho' in the Particulars he may not gain &s;o much: It is a Maxim in Trade, that light
<PB N="34" REF="33">
Gain makes a heavy Pur&s;e, and the Meaning is, that a &s;mall Profit on a large Return makes the Trade&s;man Rich; now 'tis a Mi&s;take to &s;ay the Pedlar or private Trader can live on le&s;s Profit than the Shopkeeper, becau&s;e where the one Returns one Hundred Pound, the other Returns a Thou&s;and, perhaps much more, and can by Con&s;equence lay up more by an Advance of two or three <HI>per Cent.</HI> on his Goods, than the other can by an Advance of ten <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>This makes the mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence of the Pedlar more and more evident; for if by intercepting the Shopkeeper's Trade, as above, he prevents the &s;aid Shopkeeper ma|king &s;o large a Return; he by the &s;ame Rule prevents his &s;elling his Goods at all to Profit, and &s;o the poor Retailer is ruined of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But to return, it is plain from hence, that the private Trader cannot &s;ell cheaper than the fair Shopkeeper, no nor &s;o cheap; his return being &s;mall and the others large. It is the &s;ame thing between the Retale Chap|man and the Whole&s;ale Dealer, of whom he buys; The latter &s;elling in Bulk, and by large Parcels, can afford to &s;ell at a low Rate; that is to &s;ay, for a &s;mall Profit, &s;up|po&s;e by Commi&s;&s;ion from the Maker, or otherwi&s;e, in which Ca&s;e he is content with 2 and a half, or perhaps 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Provi&s;ion for Sales; whereas the Shopkeeper retailing the &s;ame Goods by &s;mall Quantities, requires
<PB N="35" REF="34">
a large Gain, yet even his &s;mall Quantity may be called large, compared to the &s;maller Re|turns of the Hawker, and for that Rea&s;on the Hawker or Clande&s;tine Trader cannot under &s;ell the Shopkeeper; be&s;ides the Advan|tage on the Shopkeepers &s;ide of &s;elling the be&s;t Goods as above.</P>
<P>If then, he neither buys the be&s;t Goods nor &s;ells be&s;t cheap, as is plain above, what can be &s;aid for a &s;et of Men, who &s;upplant the fair Seller, and do the Buyer no good? They mu&s;t be taken as they really are, for Pyrates in Trade, Thieves to their Country; for tho' they may not be &s;aid to rob and break open Hou&s;es, (tho' they &s;tand pretty fair for a Charge of that Kind too &s;ometimes,) yet they rob their Country in a mo&s;t egregious Man|ner, &s;upplanting the Trade&s;men, and con|founding the Cour&s;e of Trade, by which the whole Country is maintained; and in this they are Enemies to the publick Pro&s;perity, they &s;tarve the Poor, impoveri&s;h the dilligent indu&s;trious Trade&s;men, and by Con&s;equence the Manufacturers al&s;o who depend upon the Trade, as it is carried on in its due Cour&s;e, and would be brought to &s;tarve and &s;ink in the &s;inking of the Shopkeepers, and that in a mo&s;t deplorable Manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. That the&s;e Hawkers and Clande&s;tine Traders are the great &s;upport of the Smugglers, and are the Tools of tho&s;e Enemies to all the fair Trade, by whom &s;o fatal a Corre&s;pondence is carried on.</HEAD>
<P>CLande&s;tine Traders are the Agents and Support of Clade&s;tine Trade; were there no receivers, there would be no Thieves: The fir&s;t Part of the Hawkers Bu&s;ine&s;s is a Pyracy upon the Home Trade: So in this la&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t Part they are Pyrates, upon the Laws of Trade in General, and of their Country in Particular; as in the fir&s;t they merit to be &s;uppre&s;t and, prevented, &s;o in the &s;econd they merit to be puni&s;hed; in the fir&s;t they de&s;erve Re&s;entment, but in the &s;econd they de&s;erve the Gallows: For indeed the carrying on a Smuggling Trade (and e&s;pe|cially as tho&s;e Men do it avowedly) is not a Breach of the Law only, but a Contempt and Defiance of that very common Ju&s;tice, which is the only Rea&s;on of Law: And doubtle&s;s, it is as real a Felony in the E&s;|&s;ence of the Crime, as robbing a Hou&s;e is in the Letter of it; and therefore running Goods

<P>As the Retailer is the Life of all Trade, &s;o the Pedlar is the E&s;&s;ence of all Clande&s;tine Trade; as the Receiver is the Support of all Thieving, &s;o the Hawker is the Life of all Smuggling; he hands on the Goods to the Con&s;umer; as he comes at them in the Dark, &s;o he di&s;per&s;es them in the Dark; into innu|merable Hands, and into &s;mall Parcels where it is not po&s;&s;ible to the Officers to di&s;cover or detect them; for when uncu&s;tomed Goods are divided into innumerable Parts, like the Blood in the capillary Ve&s;&s;els, it is impo&s;&s;ible to come at them in the Form of a legal Pro|&s;ecution.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that this is not a direct Charge upon the Hawker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that the Fact of Smuggling cannot be proved upon them: But we &s;ay it is a direct Charge for all that: For we do not &s;ay they are really the Smugglers or Runners of the Goods them|&s;elves;
<PB N="38" REF="37">
but that they are Venders and Sellers of uncu&s;tom'd run Goods, and in that Capa|city they are the Supporters and Encouragers of that wicked Trade. This they are not a&s;ham'd to acknowledge, and even to u&s;e it as an Argument, why their Cu&s;tomers &s;hould believe them, that the Goods they &s;ell are cheap, namely, <HI>That they get them immediately from on Board a Ship,</HI> or that they had them from <HI>&s;uch and &s;uch Seamen or Officers</HI> who get them on Shore <HI>&s;o</HI> and <HI>&s;o;</HI> that is to &s;ay, they are run and have paid no Duty.</P>
<P>Now tho' even in this they may be &s;ome|times, and are often times like a certain fa|mous Gentleman, who was known to boa&s;t of more Sins than ever he could commit, and that they pretend the Goods are Run <HI>when they are not;</HI> that &s;o the Buyers as above, may believe them cheap <HI>when they are not;</HI> yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that if in any thing they are able to under&s;ell, and offer their Goods cheaper than the fair Traders, it mu&s;t be in this; where they are Goods &s;muggled and clande&s;tinely got on Shore without pay|ing the Cu&s;tom, which is too often the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Thieves they &s;ay, &s;ell good Pennyworths; they mu&s;t do &s;o el&s;e no Body would buy, what they buy in the Dark they mu&s;t &s;ell in the Dark; and we will not di&s;pute this Part with them, &s;ince they boa&s;t of the Crime
<PB N="39" REF="38">
they ought to blu&s;h for, let them take their Lot with the <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Man that called him&s;elf the Miller when he was not. See <HI>the Hi&s;tory of</HI> Edward VI.</P>
<P>This we are &s;ure of, that there is not one Article in this Part but what argues &s;trongly again&s;t them, and adds to the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Trade&s;mens Petition; indeed there needs nothing more to be &s;aid to this Part, as they are the Promoters of that vile &s;muggling Trade, which in &s;pight of Laws, and in &s;pight of all the Application of the Govern|ment to put tho&s;e Laws in Execution, yet continues to be carried on among us in a mo&s;t unaccountable Manner, they ought to be fenc'd again&s;t as Enemies to their Country De&s;troyers of its Commerce, and in a Word, of all fair and hone&s;t Dealing.</P>
<P>It may be, another little Exception in the Way al&s;o, that this Charge does not reach to all the Hawkers and Pedlars, and all the clande&s;tine Traders in the Kingdom; that is to &s;ay, not this particular Part of the Charge.</P>
<P>This does not make the Complaint of the Trade&s;man le&s;s ju&s;t, nor do we alledge any &s;uch thing; but we may without a Slander &s;ay, &s;ince a great Number offend in this Part, and all are de&s;tructive in &s;ome Parts; and we may &s;ay we believe it is rather want of Opportunity than Will, if they are not concerned in this al&s;o; as &s;ome Ladies are &s;aid to be Virtuous becau&s;e they have not been tempted.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
Many of the Hawkers have their Circuits out of the way, in the Inland Counties, remote from the Sea Coa&s;t, where this black Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;muggling is only to be carried on, and they do not, becau&s;e they cannot meddle with it: But &s;etting them a Side, as it would be hard to charge them with the Crime who cannot commit it; &s;o I would be as loth to affirm that any of them have declined it, who&s;e Station has been in the way of it; and we have good Rea&s;on to &s;ay from their com|mon Dialect in their Trade, that they value them&s;elves upon it, whether they may be|liev'd again&s;t them&s;elves or no, is a Que&s;tion by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But it is &s;ufficient to the Purpo&s;e in Hand, if they are generally guilty in the Places where it is practicable: We do not Charge any body with running Goods on Shore, where there is no Shore or &s;tealing Cu&s;tom, where no Cu&s;tom is paid: The Inland Counties that have no Sea Ports cannot be concerned in that Part of the Crime: But even tho&s;e Inland Coun|ties may be, and are the Markets where the &s;muggled Goods are &s;old, and where the Agents of tho&s;e Thieves of Trade, di&s;po&s;e of them, and this Part is performed by the People we &s;peak of: Here they harangue their Cu&s;tomers with the long Journies which they make, the Pains they are at, and the Hazards they run, to get tho&s;e Goods at the Sea Side, and out of the Ships that bring them over, (tho' in
<PB N="41" REF="40">
Fact,) they never came there but have that Part done to their Hands: By the&s;e fine Stories they delude the ignorant People, and per&s;uade them to believe the Goods Foreign, when they are not, and cheap when they are dear.</P>
<P>We might ob&s;erve from this particular Part of their Management; how fond they are to be thought wor&s;e Knaves than they are, and to make the Buyers believe tho&s;e Goods are run, which really are not; at the &s;ame time being very rarely without others that are; nor would it be an unprofitable thing to argue upon, in repre&s;enting the&s;e People to the Parliament, &s;ince it would be well worth the Con&s;ideration of that Honourable Hou&s;e, Whether a &s;et of People &s;hould be any longer continued in Trade, who&s;e great|e&s;t Advantage it is to have their Cu&s;tomers believe them to be Knaves and Thieves, and who are chiefly traded with upon that Foot; a Set of Men who if they were really ju&s;t and hone&s;t, could not live by their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and if their Cu&s;tomers did not think them Rogues, (that is Smugglers) would have no Bu&s;ine&s;s at all. Some People &s;ince the Application that has been made for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Pedlars, have been apt to ask a gro&s;s Que|&s;tion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> what harm do they do to Trade, or where is the Hurt of permitting them?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">
Such a Que&s;tion can hardly be ask'd for want of Ignorance, that's certain; but &s;ince 'tis nece&s;&s;ary the ignorant Inquirer &s;hould be informed al&s;o, we think this very Chapter will go a great way to do it; name|ly, that they are the great Receivers and Di&s;per&s;ers of prohibited Goods, the Propa|gators of contraband Trade; and the En|couragers of tho&s;e profe&s;t Enemies of fair Trading, the Smugglers; and in a Word, in doing that they break the Laws, and invade the Property of Fair Dealing and clean Trade&s;men, who they injure in the highe&s;t Degree.</P>
<P>Nor would it be unworthy the Con&s;idera|tion of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons; whether it will be practicable, (however &s;evere the Laws again&s;t Smuggling may be) to put a Stop to that wicked Trade, while tho&s;e People are permitted, who thus &s;upport and encourage it.</P>
<P>One clande&s;tine Trade always upholds a|nother; the Smugglers (to give them their due) run Risk enough as the Laws now lye again&s;t them, and the Difficulties they are under to di&s;po&s;e of their prohibited Goods, are very great; and if they had not the&s;e private Traders to take them off, and no doubt but they &s;ell Pennyworths to engage them to do &s;o, and to di&s;po&s;e them by Re|tale, they would never be able to go on; but if the&s;e private Venders of uncu&s;tom'd Goods
<PB N="43" REF="42">
be but once taken off, (who are their la&s;t Re&s;ort) they, the Smugglers would be utterly at a Lo&s;s, and not able to put off the Goods when they had them, of which we &s;hall &s;ay more in its Place.</P>
<P>This is in it &s;elf a full An&s;wer to the gro&s;s Que&s;tion mentioned above, of what harm they do to Trade, and why they &s;hould not be permitted.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;chief they do in other Ca&s;es, as in &s;upplanting the Shopkeepers cutting off their Trade, and &s;erving their Cu&s;tomers at their own Doors, and &s;o &s;hortning the Cir|culation of Bu&s;ine&s;s in the &s;everal Counties; where they travel, le&s;&s;ening the Carriage, and in many other Articles have been fully &s;poken off already.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd here, tho' we have but ju&s;t room to name it, That as the Smug|gling Trade has of late &s;urpri&s;ingly encrea&s;ed, and been carried up to a prodigious heighth, which appears plainly by the &s;evere Acts of Parliament lately made again&s;t them; &s;o the Numbers of the&s;e private and clande&s;tine Traders, of whom we &s;hall &s;ay more in the next Chapter, have al&s;o encrea&s;ed; which mani|fe&s;tly &s;hews (and for that End we mention it here,) the Corre&s;pondence that has been kept up between them, and their plain Dependence upon one another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the various Species of Pedlars who are concerned in this clande&s;tine un|lawful and de&s;tructive Trade; and how they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their manner of Trading; but all joyn in this Part, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The fatal Blow they give to the &s;ettled Trade of this Kingdom, and to the fair Traders mentioned before.</HEAD>
<P>THE Complaint in General lies indeed again&s;t the licenc'd Hawker or Ped|lar, and in order to have tho&s;e Licences taken away; and it &s;eems by that Part, as if the&s;e were the only People again&s;t whom the Charge lies; But we are to ob&s;erve that there are of late a great Number of other People crept into the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s; who al&s;o may be called <HI>Hawkers</HI> and <HI>Pedlars</HI> as well as any of the re&s;t; and who merit as much to be &s;uppre&s;t; the&s;e have no Licences, and yet taking the Hazard of the Penalty, run up and down in all the great Towns and Cities in <HI>Britain,</HI> but e&s;pecially in <HI>London,</HI> to private Hou&s;es with their Goods: Here they get into
<PB N="45" REF="44">
the Favour of the Ladies, and e&s;pecially of their Maids Servants; pretending that having Goods immediately from on board a Ship, or from particular Intere&s;ts with other Per&s;ons, that have them &s;o, they are able to &s;ell cheaper than the Shops.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a &s;et of People, who as we have ob&s;erved before, value them&s;elves upon being guilty of more Sins than they can commit; and pretend to have run and uncu&s;tomed Goods to &s;ell when they have not, as well as when they have.</P>
<P>The&s;e have their Arts however to delude and impo&s;e upon the Buyers, and particularly by &s;elling &s;ome Goods to lo&s;s, rather than not &s;uit the Fancy of the Lady they are dealing with; that &s;o the Per&s;on may boa&s;t of the Pennyworth, and recommend the private Trader; in which ca&s;e they forget not, and &s;eldom fail to make up their Lo&s;s with Ad|vantage at the next Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>By thus in&s;inuating them&s;elves into the Opinion of the Buyers, they have infinite Ad|vantages to deceive and impo&s;e upon them; nor need we argue here upon the Power of the Imagination, which acts &s;o much in their Favour, or how ea&s;y it is to abu&s;e the Judgment by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Fancy; it is too well known in many like Ca&s;es, that where the Buyer is previou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Belief, that the Per&s;on <HI>can</HI> &s;ell cheaper than others, 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade them that
<PB N="46" REF="45">
he <HI>does not,</HI> and harder &s;till to per&s;uade them that they are cheated and abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>This Charge particularly relates to &s;uch private Traders as go from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, but would not be called Hawkers or Pedlars, nor do they take any Licences, &s;o that they defraud the Publick both ways: The&s;e appa|rently carry no Goods, for what they have to &s;ell being in &s;mall Bulk they ea&s;ily conceal it; or if not, they have Servants to carry for them at &s;ome Di&s;tance, &s;o as to be called on any Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>That they are really Hawkers in the Sen&s;e of the Act, is out of Que&s;tion, and they ought by the Act to take Licences; that they really do &s;ell uncu&s;tom'd and prohibited Goods is equally certain, and that they frequently abu&s;e tho&s;e they &s;ell to, by pretending their Goods are &s;uch, is as certain; and they have been frequently detected, and made to confe&s;s the Fraud. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e People frequently &s;ell Silk Handker|chiefs, and call them <HI>India;</HI> Mu&s;lins, and call them <HI>run</HI> from on board the <HI>India</HI> Ships; when in truth the fir&s;t are bought in <HI>Spittle|fields,</HI> and the latter at the ordinary Drapers Shops; and upon their being challeng'd, they have made no &s;cruple to confe&s;s it, as is &s;aid above.</P>
<P>On the other Hand they likewi&s;e &s;ell <HI>India</HI> Silks, Chints, painted Callicoes, and other Things; &s;uch as are not only prohibited, be|ing
<PB N="47" REF="46">
&s;old, but even the U&s;e and Wearing al&s;o.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t part of this Bu&s;ine&s;s they are Cheats in Trade, abu&s;e and impo&s;e upon the Buyer by Fal&s;hoods and foul Practices of &s;everal Sorts, and on that Account ought to be &s;uppre&s;t, as Enemies of the Home Trade in General; and by the latter Part they are Smugglers, and Parties to the Smugglers, dealing in, felling, and di&s;per&s;ing prohibited and uncu&s;tom'd Goods; and are puni&s;hable by the &s;everal Laws they act again&s;t; and in this la&s;t Ca&s;e, with Submi&s;&s;ion to our Supe|riors, we humbly &s;ugge&s;t that they merit to be &s;uppre&s;t, tho' the Injury which they do to the fair Traders, and to the general Com|merce of the whole Kingdom, was not to be taken notice of. The Rea&s;on I give for that, is, becau&s;e it is the Wi&s;dom of ju&s;t Govern|ments, to endeavour to prevent the Subjects Offending, rather than to de&s;ire to puni&s;h when Offences are committed.</P>
<P>It is worth Con&s;ideration al&s;o, whether &s;ome Laws more &s;trictly forbidding this clande&s;tine Commerce, than any yet in being, and more ea&s;ily put in Execution, are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and if it be only with this View; namely, for the preventing the &s;elling and di&s;per&s;ing prohibited and uncu&s;tom'd Goods; &s;eeing as is &s;aid above, it is utterly impracticable to prevent the Smuggling Trade, if the receiving, &s;elling, and di&s;per|&s;ing
<PB N="48" REF="47">
the Goods when they are Run, cannot be al&s;o prevented; and this we believe to be utterly impo&s;&s;ible, but by putting a &s;top to the Hawkers, Pedlars, and private Traders as above.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e private and clande&s;tine Traders there are another &s;ort of Pedlars who carry on the Trade, but evade the Force of the Act, and the&s;e are &s;uch as Trade under the Pro|tection of the &s;everal Provi&s;oes in the Act, re&s;erv'd; and &s;tand it out, if they are called upon, in&s;i&s;ting that they are not Hawkers or Pedlars within the Sen&s;e of the Law, and that therefore they are not obliged to take out Licences.</P>
<P>This and the backwardne&s;s of the Ju&s;tices of Peace, to put the Laws in Execution a|gain&s;t them, encourages &s;uch to carry on their Trade, as it were in Defiance of the Act for Licen&s;ing Hawkers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are &s;uch as travelling about the Country, pretend to be the Makers and Manufacturers of the Goods they &s;ell, or the Agents or Servants of &s;uch Makers and Manufacturers, and as &s;uch, they pretend they are allow'd not only by the Act of Parliament for Licences, but by &s;everal other Acts of Parliament, (formerly made a|gain&s;t Hawkers and Pedlars) to Trade, and Travel, as they do from Town to Town.</P>
<P>Now as the Pretence is in it &s;elf a Fraud, and the Practice is in it &s;elf as pernicious to Trade, as any other of the Hawkers and Ped|lars
<PB N="49" REF="48">
Bu&s;ine&s;s, except the la&s;t mentioned of Smuggling and encouraging the Smugglers Trade, &s;o it is needful to give a Brief Account of that Liberty which they pretend to, how far it extends and how far not, as al&s;o how it is abu&s;ed by the Practi&s;es of tho&s;e who pre|tend to it.</P>
<P>It is true that in an Act 3 &amp; 4 <HI>Annae Reginae,</HI> entitul'd an <HI>Act for continuing Duties upon Low Wines, and upon Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, Spices,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and upon Howkers, Pedlars, and Petty Chapmen,</HI> there is the following Provi&s;o. Pa. 125. of the &s;aid Act.</P>

<P>Again in the Act of the 9th &amp; 10th <HI>Wil|liam</HI> III. for Licen&s;ing Hawkers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is an Exemption of &s;everal Traders.</P>

Another &s;ort of Pedlars, are &s;uch as travel from Town to Town.</P>

<P>There are many other Shifts and Turns made u&s;e of by the real Pedlars to evade the Act, even for &s;o &s;mall a Thing as the Licence only: But we have not room here to give a Li&s;t of them all, it is enough to &s;ay, that even in tho&s;e Ca&s;es where any Liberties are allow'd by the Law, they are always Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors of that Law, and carry that Liberty farther than it was intended, or farther than is allow'd by the true Intent and Meaning of the Law.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Nece&s;&s;ity there is to &s;uppre&s;s not the Licen&s;ed Hawkers only, but all the private Traders of what&s;oever Denomination, and of the great Ad|vantage it would be to the Publick to do &s;o.</HEAD>
<P>IT comes now of Cour&s;e to ob&s;erve, that tho' it is true, that the Licen&s;ing the&s;e People is a manife&s;t Grievance to Trade, and by which they are encouraged to in&s;ult the Trade&s;|men, even in tho&s;e Towns and Cities where they have no legal Right, no not by their Li|cences to Trade, yet the bare taking off or repealing the Acts of Parliament for granting &s;uch Licences, is not the only Subject of this humble Application.</P>
<P>It is true that the Licenc'd Hawkers have been the Original of all, or mo&s;t Part of the Mi&s;chief &s;uffered, and that tho&s;e Licences have in a great Mea&s;ure taken off the Edge of the People's ju&s;t Aver&s;ion to them, believing that the Laws would not have allowed them, if they had been really injurious to Trade in General, or to the Shopkeepers in Particular.</P>
<P>But this is not all, from this Abatement of the People's di&s;gu&s;t at the Pedlars and Haw|kers, Throngs of private Traders have broke
<PB N="56" REF="55">
in, upon, even the Hawkers and Pedlars them&s;elves; who would not be called by the Name, but do equal Mi&s;chief, in plying as it were at People's Doors, and that even in the greate&s;t Cities, and be&s;t governed Cor|porations; carrying their Goods in &s;mall Parcels not to be di&s;covered, and &s;elling them to the Ladies even in their Bed-Chambers; as effectually and fatally circumventing and anticipating the fair Traders, as it is po&s;&s;ible for any Pedlar or Hawker to do.</P>
<P>So that tho' it is true, that we complain of the Licen&s;ing and permitting the Hawkers and Pedlars as &s;uch, and under the &s;everal Denominations and De&s;criptions given of them above, and humbly hope for Relief again&s;t them, by the Repeal of the &s;everal Laws, granting tho&s;e Licen&s;ing, yet we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t al&s;o, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome proper Clau&s;es, granted in &s;uch new Law as &s;hall be made, as may effectually &s;up|pre&s;s all tho&s;e private clande&s;tine Traders al&s;o, otherwi&s;e the re&s;t will be of no Effect.</P>
<P>It is not the Men that we &s;o earne&s;tly move again&s;t, as they are Men, but as they are Injurious and De&s;tructive by their foul Prac|tice in Trade; 'tis the Hawking and Peddling in all its various Forms and Shapes, however di&s;gui&s;ed and concealed, whether with or without a Licence, and indeed of the two, tho&s;e without a Licence &s;eem to be the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous in great Towns and Cities; tho&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="56">
with the Licence are &s;o in Country Towns and Villages, and e&s;pecially at <HI>lone Hou&s;es</HI> as we call them, Hou&s;es &s;tanding &s;ingle and &s;cat|ter'd about the Country.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who Ply or Practice (call it as you will) in Cities and populous Towns, and e&s;|pecially in <HI>London,</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to be more in Number than tho&s;e that are Licenc'd, and con&s;equently may do mo&s;t Mi&s;chief; be&s;ides they have the Chance to deal among the richer Sort of People, and with tho&s;e who have mo&s;t Money to lay out; &s;o that they not only take more ready Money than the other, but as they can &s;ooner &s;upply them&s;elves with Quantities of the like Goods, than they can who Travel farther off, &s;o they make quicker Returns, and require le&s;s Stock.</P>
<P>Every one of the&s;e Articles are Injurious to the fair Trader, for all the&s;e Sums of ready Money if not thus intercepted would circulate in a regular Manner, in the ordinary Way of Trade, and give Life and Spirit to the Shopkeeper, of whatever Trades the Buyer was formerly u&s;ed to deal with; and the Goods pa&s;s, thro' all the circulating Mean|ders of Trade, which are known &s;o much to &s;upport the Body of our Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>This is a Rea&s;on well worthy the Con|&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature, and which if duly Weigh'd would &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing the&s;e People; namely, that by this they
<PB N="58" REF="57">
will re&s;tore Trade to its ancient State &s;uch as it was, when the Wealth and Oppulence of this Nation was fir&s;t rai&s;ed; for we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that the Greatne&s;s of our Country has been chiefly, if we may not &s;ay wholly rai&s;ed by our Trade.</P>
<P>The Increa&s;e of our People, the rai&s;ing the Value of Lands, the infinite Improvements, in Cultivation, in Navigation, in Arts, in Manufactures, and in a Word, in every valua|ble Thing, has been all (under Providence) owing to our Trade; and of all Trade, our Home Trade is the Life, the Soul, and the Support of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This Home Trade is wounded, weaken'd, we may almo&s;t &s;ay, murther'd by the&s;e Py|rates, and by their Depredations; it langui&s;hes like Children without the Brea&s;t; the Stream as is &s;aid above, is turned away from the Mill; the Buyers or Cu&s;tomers are turned away from the Shops; the Money which was the Life of their Trade, runs into other Hands: If any Trade is left to the Shopkeeper it is the tru&s;ting Part, where the Money comes &s;low, and where Lo&s;&s;es often falls heavy; &s;o that the Shopkeeper has the Gleanings of the Trade, while the Pedlar and the Haw|ker have the Harve&s;t; the Shopkeeper has the Milk, and the Pedlar the Cream.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Di&s;advantages in the Trade, the poor decaying Shopkeeper has a large Rent to pay, and Family to Support; he maintains
<PB N="59" REF="58">
not his own Children only, but all the poor Orphans and Widows in his Pari&s;h; nay, &s;ometimes the Widows and Orphans of the very Pedlar or Hawker, who has thus fatally laboured to &s;tarve him: How often when they peri&s;h in their unju&s;t Dealings, are their Wives and Orphans pa&s;t home to the Pari&s;hes, for the injured oppre&s;t Trade&s;man to help maintain.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e People remov'd, Trade would &s;oon return and revive; when once Trade came to flow in its right Channel, it would recover its former Magnitude and Glory, and the Shopkeepers would thrive again as they formerly did.</P>
<P>We have had abundance of Inquiries made into the Rea&s;on of the decay of our Trade, and the declining of our Trade&s;men; why &s;o many Commi&s;&s;ions of Bankrupts are granted, why the Goals are (however frequently empty'd,) &s;o &s;oon fill'd again with demoli&s;h'd Trade&s;men and broken Shop|keepers; we mu&s;t &s;ay, we think they go round about in &s;eeking for the Cau&s;e, who look any farther than to this unhappy mi&s;erable Inva&s;ion of Trade, by Vagrants and Thieves.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the People who ruin both the Buying and the Selling; the &s;elling Pedlar robs the fair Trader of his ready Money Cu&s;tomers; and the Smuggling Pedlar robs him of his buying to Advantage: They buy of the Smugglers, who by robbing the Government of the Cu&s;toms,
<PB N="60" REF="59">
bring in Goods from the Foreigner, and the Profit (at lea&s;t great Part of it) goes away to Strangers; they have the Market, and we the Lo&s;s; for it is evident, much of the Smuggling Trade is managed by Foreigners: They bring the Brandy, the Salt, the Tea, the Coffee to our Coa&s;t, and into our Ports; we, (that is our Thieves) go on Board and buy, and tho' they may buy cheap compared to the Price, which the fair Trader pays, yet they pay dear compared to what the Foreigner can afford to &s;ell for.</P>
<P>We might enlarge upon the Proof of this, by enquiring into the Trade for Brandy in &s;mall Casks, carried on for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, by the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> Men; by the I&s;le of Man Merchants, and &s;everal others: But 'tis enough to name them, the re&s;t is too well known, to need any Explanations.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e Hawkers, private and clande|&s;tine Traders, effectually &s;uppre&s;s'd by Law, all the&s;e Evils would be at once remov'd, and (as is &s;aid above,) Trade would be re&s;tored to its antient Channel, and would of Cour&s;e revive and enrich the whole Na|tion: On this Account it is, that we &s;ay, it is a thing of Value, &s;ufficient to move the Con|&s;ideration of the whole Legi&s;lature, and with that Confidence we pre&s;ume thus to lay it before them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Numbers of the People em|ploy'd thus in clande&s;tine Trade, and whether it be ju&s;t, to throw &s;o many Hands out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and perhaps out of the Kingdom; &s;ince Numbers of Inhabitants are the Wealth and Strength of a Nation.</HEAD>
<P>NUmbers of People are without Que&s;tion, the Strength and Wealth of a Nation; we mo&s;t readily grant the General.</P>
<P>But then it mu&s;t be Numbers of legally &s;ettled Inhabitants, not Numbers of Vagrants and wan|dering People: Settled Inhabitants, are Indu&s;tri|ous, Laborious, and lend their helping Hands to all the Exigences of the whole Body; whether Publick or Private. They pay their ju&s;t Proportions in all Rates, A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments and Taxes, as well to the Government, and to the Church, as to the Maintenance of the Poor, to the Repair of Highways, Bridges, publick Edifices, and whatever the Community calls for.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Inhabitants who&s;e Numbers are of Import in a Government; and if we had two Millions or three Millions of &s;uch
<PB N="60" REF="61">
more than we have, the Kingdom would be &s;till &s;o much the Richer and Stronger: The&s;e all live by hone&s;t Means, carry on lawful Employments, and &s;upport their Families by Indu&s;try and Application in their re&s;pective Callings; and if they have not E&s;tates before Hand, oftentimes rai&s;e E&s;tates by their own Genius and Inclination to Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This very Argument therefore is on our Side with all imaginable Advantage; for if the&s;e fair Traders are the People, in who&s;e Numbers and Encrea&s;e, the publick Oppu|lence &s;o really con&s;i&s;ts, (and &s;uch it is plain the Manufacturers, Artifficers, Shopkeepers and Retailers are, as well in the Cities as in the Countries) then it mu&s;t certainly be the Wi&s;dom of every Government to nouri&s;h and pre&s;erve them; and by all ju&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Laws and Magi&s;trates to keep them from being &s;upplanted and oppre&s;t by unfair and clande&s;tine Traders: As for the Numbers on the other Side, how many &s;oever they may be &s;aid to be, they are not to be nam'd in com|pari&s;on to the Multitudes who are injured and oppre&s;s'd by them, as we &s;hall ob&s;erve pre&s;ently; on the other Hand to the Que&s;tion of what &s;hall become of them, the An&s;wer is &s;hort and direct.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let them &s;ettle them&s;elves, fix their Habitations, open Shops, and Trade fairly as others do: The Country is open, and the Trade is open, indeed the exclu&s;ive Privi|leges
<PB N="63" REF="62">
of &s;ome Places may here and there &s;hut them out, but there is room enough for them to come into Bu&s;ine&s;s almo&s;t where they plea&s;e; and were they inclined to do &s;o, and be|come fair Trade&s;men as others do, deal in a regular Manner, and carry on their Bu&s;ine&s;s as other Dealers do, we doubt not but &s;uch Clau&s;es might be obtain'd in their Favour, as to take away all Excu&s;es for Pedling and Smuggling from them: But it is not in their very Nature as Pedlars, as it is not in the Nature of Beggars to Work; &s;o after a Man has once commenc'd Pedlar, he can no more fall into Trade in a fair and legal Way, than a Fi&s;h can live out of Water.</P>
<P>We know they pretend they are &s;hut out of the great Trading Cities, Towns, and Cor|porations, by the re&s;pective Charters and all other &s;ettled Privileges of tho&s;e Places: But we an&s;wer, that tho' for want of legal In|troduction they may not be able to &s;et up in Cities, Corporations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet there are many Places of very great Trade, where no Corporation Privileges would ob&s;truct them, of which pre&s;ently.</P>
<P N="2">2. If any of them &s;hould be reduc'd, and as &s;ome alledge, be brought to the Pari&s;h to keep; that is to &s;ay, their Wives and Children, the Manufacturers, the Shop|keepers who confe&s;&s;edly make up the principal Numbers of tho&s;e Corporations, and are the chief Supporters of the Pari&s;hes, will be much
<PB N="64" REF="63">
more willing to maintain them, than to be ruin'd by them.</P>
<P>But to return to the great Objection, about the Numbers of them; we in&s;i&s;t that it is all a Delu&s;ion; Nor are the Numbers of tho&s;e People, &s;o great as to be nam'd in Compe|tition with the Numbers of the People who &s;uffer by them: They are numerous indeed, when we &s;peak of the Injury they do, for a &s;mall Number may ruin a greater, and a few are &s;ufficient to do Mi&s;chief to a whole Com|munity; but we &s;ay, they are &s;o few com|pared to the very great Numbers of the Trade&s;men and Manufacturers who are op|pre&s;s'd by them, that we are not affraid hum|bly to referr that Part to the ju&s;t Con&s;idera|tion of the Parliament, who cannot be at a Lo&s;s for good Rea&s;ons to di&s;mi&s;s them from the De&s;tructive Trade, which they now car|ry on, and to find &s;ome other way to pro|vide for their Numbers, or to employ their Numbers, &s;uch as may render them u&s;eful to their Country, not De&s;troyers of it.</P>
<P>That they are De&s;troyers, as they are now &s;tation'd in Trade, is out of all Doubt: As Smuggling is to the fair Merchant, &s;o Ped|ling is to the fair Shopkeeper; one cheats the Government of their Duties, and the other cheats the Shopkeeper of his due Profits in Bu&s;ine&s;s; the one turns the Channel of Trade from the Whole&s;ale Man and from the Retailer to the Pedlar, the other turns the
<PB N="65" REF="64">
Merchants Trade from the Importer to the Smuggler. But this is &s;ufficiently explained already, we mention it again here to inforce the pre&s;ent Argument, that their Trade and Practice being in its own Nature unju&s;t and ruinous to the Community, the Numbers that may be concerned in it, ought to be &s;o far from a Plea for their Continuance, that on the other Hand it is the &s;tronge&s;t Plea imagi|nable for their being &s;uppre&s;t.</P>
<P>The greater the Evil is, the more pre&s;&s;ing is the Complaint; and the more moving in Favour of the Complainer, if their Number indeed was formidable; if we could be &s;o weak as to &s;uppo&s;e, that it would not be &s;afe to attempt them, we &s;hould talk in another Dialect of them, and they might go on till the whole Inland-Trade of <HI>England</HI> was dwindled into Pedling and Hawking, as it is at this time in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and other Countries on that Side of the World.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e is ju&s;t the Rever&s;e in <HI>England;</HI> they are a great Number indeed con&s;idering them <HI>qua. Pedlars,</HI> and they do an incredible Mi&s;chief to our Trade; but they are a mo&s;t contemptible few, when we view them in the Hands of Ju&s;tice; and &s;hould the Parlia|ment think fit to di&s;arm them of their Li|cences, or legal Claim to this walking Em|ploy, and add &s;ome needful Clau&s;es, to put a &s;top to the clande&s;tine unlicenc'd Rabble which now break in upon us, the fair Traders will
<PB N="66" REF="65">
never want any Aid, but that of the Civil Magi&s;trate, and his Peace Officers to cru&s;h the whole Body of them; nor unle&s;s by any fla|grant Crime, they merit farther Ju&s;tice, will they that are refractory need any other Goal than the Cage; or other Puni&s;hment, than the Stocks or the Whipping-Po&s;t.</P>
<P>It is true the Mi&s;chief is much greater to Trade than otherwi&s;e it would be, becau&s;e of the unhappy Temper of tho&s;e who deal with, and encourage the&s;e private Traders; we mean <HI>the Buyers;</HI> who being &s;ometimes gratified with the Advantage of buying a prohibited or clande&s;tinely run Commodity, in which they think they have what they call a Penny|worth; not only admit them freely into their Hou&s;es, but recommend them from one to another; not regarding the publick Evil which they encourage, or the Damage they do to Trade in General.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to reflect, how this Hu|mour in Trade fir&s;t crept in&s;en&s;ibly upon us, and &s;till more wonderful to think, to what a fatal Degree it is increa&s;ed within a few Years pa&s;t: Till it has &s;app'd the very Foun|dations of our Commerce, and brought a great Part of that flouri&s;hing Bu&s;ine&s;s which we u&s;ed to call Whole&s;ale Trade, and which made &s;uch a Figure in this Nation, and in the City of <HI>London</HI> e&s;pecially, to dwindle almo&s;t wholly into Pedling and Pack-Markets; till our Shops are &s;hut up in a frightful Manner
<PB N="67" REF="66">
and Number; and in&s;tead of the Con&s;umer going to the proper Market to clothe and equip them&s;elves, the Trade is become va|guing and ambulatory, and as we &s;aid above, the Shop follows the Cu&s;tomers, not the Cu&s;tomers the Shop.</P>
<P>But our Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to &s;it &s;till bemoan|ing the Decay of our Trade, but to apply warmly and vigorou&s;ly to the Remedy; and to implore the Aid of our happy Repre&s;enta|tives, in who&s;e Power it is, and prevail with them to find out for us, the proper and imme|diate Specifick for this chronical Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is our Happine&s;s that in this Application, we can make it appear, that we do not &s;peak our own Sentiments alone, or the Language of the Cityonly; tho' that great Body con&s;i&s;ting of the principal Merchants and Whole&s;ale Dealers in <HI>England,</HI> might be well &s;uppo&s;ed to un|der&s;tand the true Intere&s;t of Trade in General, as well as of their own Trade in Particular.</P>
<P>But the Complaint comes from all Parts of the Kingdom, even the mo&s;t remote; and we have Letters from Places the mo&s;t di&s;tant from one another, and who have no Corre&s;|pondence with one another, yet all concurring in the &s;ame Complaint, and praying the Aid of the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> in pu&s;hing on their earne&s;t Applications to the Parliament for Redre&s;s of this Grievance.</P>
<P>Some of our Letters expre&s;s in a mo&s;t feel|ing and affectionate Manner, the great Con|cern
<PB N="68" REF="67">
they are under in the Country, from the Apprehen&s;ions (may we not call them ju&s;t Ap|prehen&s;ions), that their Trade will be entirely ruin'd and lo&s;t, by the pu&s;hing on this de|structive Method of Selling by Hawkers and Pedlars.</P>
<P>Were the Numbers of People (not to men|tion the Weight and Value of them) as Trade&s;|men, Manufacturers, and Shopkeepers but to be &s;ugge&s;ted, who have already &s;ent, and would upon the lea&s;t Hint of the Occa&s;ion, &s;end up their earne&s;t Complaints in this Ca&s;e; &s;hould we but &s;uppo&s;e what a Porportion they bear to the whole Body, we &s;hould no more &s;peak of the Numbers of the Pedlars and Hawkers, who would be di&s;tre&s;s'd by this Law: The Que|&s;tion would be as gro&s;s as it would be, to ask whether a Thou&s;and People &s;hould &s;uffer, or a Hundred Thou&s;and, whether <HI>in a Word,</HI> twenty Thou&s;and or a Million; the Numbers of the Shopkeepers, Manufacturers, and fair Traders, bearing, to that of the Pedlars as much diffe|rence in Proportion as that and much greater.</P>
<P>If then the Numbers of the Pedlars, or their Weight in the common Wealth, can bear no Proportion to the Numbers of the Shop|keepers and Manufacturers, who are thus inju|ried by their Means; what have we to con&s;i|der on their Account? The only thing that re|mains, &s;eems to be to recommend it to them to &s;eek Employments for them&s;elves, and to get
<PB N="69" REF="68">
their Bread by &s;ome other and more hone&s;t Way of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that may not expo&s;e them to the ju&s;t Re&s;entment of their Country, and cau&s;e them to be treated as Enemies.</P>
<P>Why may we not as well pity the brave Body of Soldiers and Seamen, which upon the Conclu&s;ion of a War are u&s;ually reduc'd, di&s;|banded, and &s;ent Home oftentimes without Money, or with but very little; and who are left to &s;eek their Bread where 'they can get it. The Law does not &s;pare them, if they Rob and Plunder, or commit any of the or|dinary Excur&s;ions u&s;ual in the Armies and in the Field; and tho' they may be &s;aid to have de&s;erv'd well of their Country, they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to be injured, neither are they injur'd that they are left de&s;titute of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and have their Bread to &s;eek.</P>
<P>How much le&s;s then are the&s;e People u&s;ed ill, who are only disbanded from a really injurious, and in its Nature unlawful Trade, but are left at Liberty to turn hone&s;t Men, and apply them&s;elves to other Bu&s;ine&s;s for their Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Nor can they plead, that they are Cripples and di&s;abled from Labour, or &s;uperannuated, and pa&s;t u&s;ing other Means; for they that are able to travel the Country, loaden, as they ge|nerally are, with heavy Packs and Parcels of Goods, carrying them from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and from Town to Town, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be weak Bodies and unfit for Labour; on the con|trary,
<PB N="70" REF="69">
mo&s;t of them are lu&s;ty, young, &s;trong and able for Labour, and enur'd to Hard&s;hips; and as for tho&s;e that have (and travel with) Hor&s;es, they are generally Men of &s;ome Sub|&s;tance, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed able to take Shops as we have &s;aid, &s;ettle in Towns, and become hone&s;t Trade&s;men among their Neighbours.</P>
<P>If there are any poor among them who me|rit Regard, the Method for them is plain and ea&s;y, <HI>viz.</HI> They may be pa&s;s'd Home to the re&s;pective Pari&s;hes, to which they belong; where even the Shopkeepers them&s;elves (tho' &s;o much injur'd by them) will be willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t to their Maintenance in a legal Manner.</P>
<P>Thus either way the Oppre&s;&s;ion will be light, if it may be called an Oppre&s;&s;ion, the greate&s;t Grievance to Trade that ever did or ever can befal it in this Nation, would be redre&s;t, and the Pedlars becoming hone&s;t Shopkeepers, would be &s;o far from being the Pe&s;t and Grievance of the Towns and Pari&s;hes, that they would &s;et their Shoulders to the common Burthen, and be the Support of that Commerce which before they de&s;troy'd.</P>
