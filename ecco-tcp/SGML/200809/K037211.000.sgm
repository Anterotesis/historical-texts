I could wi&s;h, neverthele&s;s, old white wine &s;tood higher in his Lord&s;hip's favour; that I may not be &s;tinted at table, or in my by-drinkings.

<P>So the world goes Bardolph. Up and down! But is it not hard now? I that have&mdash;but that's nothing. I hate boa&s;ting.

Before the younker knew me, he could not drink &s;ack; made con&s;cience of going to church on holidays; and blu&s;h'd like a &s;carlet cloak, at entering a bawdy-hou&s;e. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tructed him in all the manly exerci&s;es.

Nay, &s;etting rotten limbs and dig|nity a&s;ide, have I not even pimp'd for the ba&s;hful rogue?
<PB N="20" REF="25">

<P>Sir John, I believe, there you forget your&s;elf; the prince wanted no a&s;&s;i&s;tance of you in that; for when he was a little crack, he would &s;wear ye as well as a man &s;ix foot high.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Bardolph, you are right. I remember me; &s;wearing indeed he knew: for, tho' but a king's &s;on, he would, as thou &s;ay'&s;t, rap out an oath like an emperor. But then for the quinte&s;&s;ence of all elocution, the u&s;e of the hyperbole, vulgarly call'd lying; there I am a ma&s;ter, yet what a deal of pains it hath co&s;t me to teach Hal to lie&punc; and all thrown away upon him. He would never do it roundly. He had no genius that way.</P>

<P>Something! the &s;ervices I have done him and his father are out of number. Methinks my behaviour, in the ever memorable action at Shrew&s;bury, &s;hould make him blu&s;h at his ingratitude.

<PB N="26" REF="31">

Having a little pique or &s;o at my Lord-chief-ju&s;tice, and Mr. Shallow, here, thinking him&s;elf qualified, I promis'd him my in|tere&s;t for his wor&s;hip's removal from the quorum to his lord&s;hip's place on the bench.

<P>Thy ill-manners, Sir John, would be inexcu&s;able, were it not to be &s;uppo&s;ed the con&s;equence of an habitual antipathy to every thing that is good.

of life. I am heartily tir'd of it. Indeed, I am, good fa|ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to find thee in &s;uch promi&s;ing di&s;po&s;i|tions, and think thou could&s;t not do better than to betake thy&s;elf, agreeable to his lord&s;hip's intentions, to &s;ome mo|na&s;tery, where thou wilt be &s;ecluded from temptations, and have all &s;piritual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to encourage thee to mortify the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold thee there, good father. Let me under|&s;tand thee. What! would his lord&s;hip make a monk of me? I mu&s;t there beg his pardon. A monk; and to mortify the fle&s;h! For heav'ns &s;ake, good father, con&s;ider what a mortification indeed that mu&s;t be to me, who have fix times the quantity of any other man. If I mu&s;t be in|cluded within the pale of the church, why not make a canon of me (not indeed a minor canon) but a prebendary, or a bi&s;hop, now. Something might be &s;aid for either of the&s;e. But for a monk! I know not any thing I am le&s;s fit for; unle&s;s indeed his lord&s;hip had meant to make a running footman of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir John, his lord&s;hip will not u&s;e compul|&s;ion in this. He will not &s;o far lay a re&s;traint on your in|clinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, if I ever find my&s;elf that way inclin'd; his lord&s;hip may depend on it I &s;hall be as ready as ever to follow my inclinations. But the le&s;&s;on of lean and &s;allow ab&s;tinence is very long and hard, good father; I am not gotten half-way through the fir&s;t chapter yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some &s;teps, however, Sir John, you mu&s;t take, toward a more reputable way of life; and that &s;peedily too: otherwi&s;e you will be &s;tript of the honours of knight|hood; and the king's &s;entence of bani&s;hment will be &s;trictly put into execution again&s;t you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the matter of knighthood; once a knight and always a knight, you know. The king may make as many knights as he plea&s;es; but he will not &s;o ea&s;ily unmake them again. My title will not depend on the king's courte&s;y, but on that of my followers. I am, not|with&s;tanding, very de&s;irous to give his lord&s;hip &s;atis|faction:
<PB N="51" REF="56">
and do a&s;&s;ure thee, on the honour of a &s;oldier, of the &s;incerity of my repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this may be only a tran&s;itory fit of penitence, owing to your late di&s;appointment. What rea&s;on can&s;t thou give me to hope this &s;tate of mind will continue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, father, what I am &s;hortly going to do is an act, that has confin'd many a man to a &s;tate of repentance, which hath continued to the la&s;t hour of his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir John, is &s;aying &s;omething. Pray what are you going to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken a re&s;olution, father, to&mdash;What do&s;t thou think now it is I have re&s;olv'd upon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some commendable act of penance, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it may well be call'd &s;o, I believe. I am determin'd, good father, to marry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call you that an act of penance, Sir John? Is mar|riage a &s;tate of mortification?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h I may not find it &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir John, marriage is a holy &s;tate; and in &s;ome degree I approve your re&s;olution; but, in the e&s;timation of the church, it is al&s;o an holy act, and ought not to be enter'd into unadvi&s;edly. Your repentance &s;hould precede your receiving the benefit of that &s;acra|ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, doubt not but I &s;hall repent me &s;ufficiently afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Sir John, Sir John, I fear me you are no true penitent: but, however, it may be lawful to &s;alve what cannot be effectually cur'd. I did not expect to make a convert at the fir&s;t interview. If thou take&s;t any mea&s;ures that tend toward reformation, thou &s;halt have my prayers and be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance therein. Another time I will hold farther conver&s;ation with thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>In the mean time, good father, let me &s;tand fair in your report to my Lord-chief-ju&s;tice and his maje&s;ty.</P>

<L>THE mu&s;e of Shake&s;peare's compliments!&mdash;A card</L>
<L>T'excu&s;e this evening's enterprizing Bard!</L>
<L>Great his pre&s;umption, to confe&s;s the truth:</L>
<L>But, as he pleads the pa&s;&s;ion of his youth,</L>
<L>Together with the magick of her charms,</L>
<L>Attracting him re&s;i&s;tle&s;s to her arms;</L>
<L>Tho' &s;omewhat by &s;urprize, &s;he owns, &s;he &s;uffer'd,</L>
<L>Yet, as no actual violence was offer'd,</L>
<L>She's willing, if the audience &s;hould agree,</L>
<L>For this one time to &s;et th'offender free.</L>
<L>We women &s;oon forgive, if not forget,</L>
<L>The crimes our beauties make the men commit,</L>
<L>E&s;pecially when once we're pa&s;t our prime,</L>
<L>And Shake&s;peare's mu&s;e, like me,'s the wor&s;e for time.</L>
<L>For, tho' &s;he charm with fancy ever young,</L>
<L>Tho' heav'nly mu&s;ick dwell upon her tongue,</L>
<L>Lo&s;t many an artle&s;s &s;mile and dimple &s;leek,</L>
<L>Which &s;at alluring on her virgin cheek;</L>
<L>Beauties, that faded on the gazer's eye,</L>
<L>And no cold-cream of comment can &s;upply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As for what Merc'ry in the Prologue told ye;</L>
<L>Pray, let not that from clemency with-hold ye.</L>
<L>That Hermes was of old a lying blade,</L>
<L>And practic'd in impo&s;ture, as his trade;</L>
<L>The patron he, or cla&s;&s;ic lore deceives,</L>
<L>Of cheats, fore&s;tallers, higglers, huck&s;ters, thieves.</L>

<LG>
<L>Be&s;ides,&mdash;to tell you a &s;tage-trick of ours&mdash;</L>
<L>But you'll not &s;pread the &s;ecret out of doors,&mdash;</L>
<L>The man was no more Mercury, than I am</L>
<L>Queen Hecuba, the wife of Trojan Priam.</L>
<L>A me&s;&s;enger from Phoebus! He a god!</L>
<L>I can a&s;&s;ure you all, 'twas Mr. Dodd;</L>
<L>His dropping from the clouds, was all a &s;ham;</L>
<L>And his pretended errand but a flam.</L>
<L>We've heathen gods of pa&s;te-board, made to fly</L>
<L>On hempen cords acro&s;s the painted &s;ky;</L>
<L><PB REF="75">Tho&s;e canva&s;s clouds, that dangle there above,</L>
<L>Inveloping the throne it&s;elf of love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His tale fictitious too, tho' told &s;o glib;</L>
<L>For take it on my word, 'twas all a fib.</L>
<L>Old Fal&s;taff in Ely&s;ium!&mdash;To my thinking,</L>
<L>So great his natural tendency to &s;inking,</L>
<L>That to the &s;hades if he had once de&s;cended,</L>
<L>To bring him back, not Atlas had pretended.</L>
<L>Dramatic &s;prites (at lea&s;t they tell me &s;o)</L>
<L>Dwell not with &s;aints above, nor devils below:</L>
<L>But, form'd th' imagination to engage,</L>
<L>During their &s;hort-liv'd pa&s;&s;age o'er the &s;tage,</L>
<L>As mere ideal characters exi&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;tand as cyphers mark'd on Nature's li&s;t;</L>
<L>To genius giv'n a delegated power</L>
<L>To form the&s;e tran&s;ient beings of an hour,</L>
<L>Which, from this mimic world whene'er they go,</L>
<L>Are free to range in fancy's pimlico,</L>
<L>A limbo large and broad; which in the &s;chools</L>
<L>Is call'd by &s;ome the Paradi&s;e of Fools.</L>
<L><HI>Feroe naturoe</HI> THERE, their pre&s;ervation</L>
<L>Is purchas'd by no game a&s;&s;ociation:</L>
<L>The poaching plagiary alone denied</L>
<L>A priviege, granted to each bard be&s;ide;</L>
<L>Who, tho' a cottager, to try his &s;kill,</L>
<L>May &s;hoot, or cour&s;e, or hunt them down at will;</L>
<L>In his own paddock may the &s;trays receive,</L>
