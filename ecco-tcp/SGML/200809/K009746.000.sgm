<P>THOUGH I am &s;eldom inclined to think much of my own little Abilities, I cannot help feeling &s;ome Vanity, when their E&s;&s;ays are crown'd with the Approba|tion of &s;o great a Ma&s;ter in the Belles Lettres, as your Lord|&s;hip. To be able to engage the Attention, or acquire the Patronage of the Earl of POMFRET, implies Merit: Since to the many Virtues which reflect Honour upon elevated Rank, he adds deep Penetration, &s;trong Judgment, well dige&s;ted Learning, and a Ta&s;te truly elegant.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think my&s;elf, My Lord, ungrateful if I omitted this Opportunity of a&s;&s;uring you, I &s;hall always retain a deep Sen&s;e of the very particular Favours you have been plea&s;ed to confer upon me.

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FINGAL, King of <HI>Morven,</HI> returning Home vic|torious from the Expedition in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which is ce|lebrated in the Epic Poem bearing his Name, made a Fea&s;t, to which all his Chiefs, <HI>Ma-ronnan</HI> and <HI>Aldo</HI> ex|cepted, were invited. The Neglect &s;eems to have been accidental; however they re&s;ented it &s;o &s;trongly as to aban|don their native Country, and enter into the Service of <HI>Erragon,</HI> King of <HI>Sora,</HI> a Name given to &s;ome Part of <HI>Scandinavia.</HI> Here <HI>Lorma,</HI> the beautiful Wife of <HI>Erragon,</HI> &s;eeing <HI>Aldo</HI> by chance, his Reputation as a Warrior being very high, fell in Love with him. He return'd her Pa&s;|&s;ion, and they fled into <HI>Morven. Erragon</HI> pur&s;uing them, invaded that Kingdon with a powerful Force, and &s;lew <HI>Aldo</HI> in &s;ingle Combat, but was him&s;elf &s;lain by <HI>Gaul,</HI> the Son of <HI>Morni,</HI> and his Army defeated. This is the Sub|ject of the en&s;uing Poem, which is beautiful, &s;entimental, and intere&s;ting. It was deliver'd by <HI>O&s;&s;ian,</HI> after becom|ing blind, to a <HI>Culdee,</HI> or Chri&s;tian Hermit, who led a reclu&s;e Life near him, and who&s;e Sacred Hymns he ima|gined were compo&s;ed in Honour of his decea&s;ed Chiefs, or Addre&s;&s;es to the Spirits in the Air.</P>
