<P>WHY all this di&s;tre&s;s my kind Harriot, why &s;o much anxiety on your I&s;abella's account? I hoped my la&s;t would have con|vinced
<PB N="2" REF="4">
you I am by no means &s;o unhappy, as your fears would per&s;uade you; no doubt we have &s;uffered, <HI>&s;everely &s;uffered:</HI> the un|expected change in our &s;ituation is certainly a very mortifying cir|cum&s;tance; but, remember my dear, we are not the fir&s;t, would to heaven we might be the la&s;t, who have been ruined by that de&s;tructive vice; 'twas my poor father's only foible; do not then let us be too &s;evere on his memory; nor are we Harriot left quite de&s;|titute as you &s;uppo&s;e, far from it: my Orlando's commi&s;&s;ion is alone &s;ufficient to maintain him as a gentleman, had he no more, but
<PB N="3" REF="5">
he has more&mdash;after paying all my father's debts, and &s;orry, <HI>&s;orry,</HI> am I to &s;ay, they were mo&s;tly what is fal&s;ely called debts of honor; we find a rever&s;ion of near two thou&s;and pounds. What is this, you will perhaps a&s;k, when com|pared to the noble e&s;tate he has lo&s;t at the gaming table?&mdash;nothing&mdash;yet Harriot, how many, no le&s;s worthy than our&s;elves are there at this moment, who would look upon even our pre&s;ent &s;ituation as enviable; 'tis by reflections of this nature I endeavour to re|concile my&s;elf to my fate, and, thank heaven, <HI>I am</HI> reconciled to it.&mdash;O &s;pare then, my dear Harriot
<PB N="4" REF="6">
<HI>yours</HI> on the memory of my unfor|tunate father. I know they are the effects of your tender affection to me; but they hurt my feelings, I can pity, I can lament his &s;itu|ation; this I can allow <HI>you</HI> to do; but, indeed you mu&s;t &s;pare your cen&s;ures on a conduct, which, though faulty, a daughter ought not to condemn: alas, he &s;uffered mo&s;t &s;everely&mdash;his agony&mdash;his re|mor&s;e in his la&s;t moments would have pierced the mo&s;t flinty heart.&mdash;Orlando's behaviour&mdash;but no words can do it ju&s;tice&mdash;'twas great&mdash;'twas noble&mdash;not a mur|mur&mdash;not even a &s;igh e&s;caped him for his <HI>own</HI> fate, all his feelings
<PB N="5" REF="7">
were for the &s;ufferings of a father who&s;e failings he pitied, and wi&s;hed to forget&mdash;<HI>he,</HI> Harriot, has indeed, a degree of manly fortitude, to which your poor I&s;abella has no preten&s;ions: my re&s;ignation proceeds rather from an indifference for the &s;uperfluities of life, from a happy flow of &s;pirits, which has ever led me to look on the bright &s;ide of the picture, and let me add, which &s;hould indeed have been fir&s;t men|tioned, a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that, the Almighty never wholly for|&s;akes the virtuous, nor lays heavier burdens on any of his creatures, than they are able to bear. What
<PB N="6" REF="8">
have I then to fear?&mdash;poverty&mdash;be it &s;o, far be it from me to be|lieve all who are de&s;titute of riches are mi&s;erable&mdash;nor can I be deemed ab&s;olutely poor, having &s;uch a brother as my Orlando&mdash;he may&mdash;nay, he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> ri&s;e in his profe&s;&s;ion, if merit can entitle him to it; and though that does not always fol|low, yet a very &s;uperior degree of it, is &s;eldom wholly overlooked, and &s;uch is his&mdash;have I not a kind affectionate friend too in my Har|riot, who, I am po&s;itively certain will love me more truly now, if po&s;&s;ible, than in my days of pro&s;|perity?&mdash;adver&s;ity is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be the te&s;t of friend&s;hip; I am under no apprehen&s;ions for the lo&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="9">
of yours&mdash;tho&s;e who may now look cool upon me, I have pride enough to de&s;pi&s;e, and thus we are quits&mdash;it will &s;hew me their real value, and that, let me tell you, is gaining no incon&s;iderable know|ledge.&mdash;Are you convinced my dear Harriot, that I am not &s;o much to be pitied as you have hitherto kindly feared? believe me, happine&s;s is an imaginary ble&s;&s;ing, at lea&s;t, 'tis in the mind we mu&s;t &s;eek for it, not in tho&s;e outward trappings, which wealth be&s;tows, and can <HI>only</HI> be&s;tow. I am very much per&s;uaded, I &s;hall find my&s;elf as thoroughly &s;atisfied and content, nay, as vain of my
<PB N="8" REF="10">
charms too, in a neat linen or mu&s;lin gown, as ever I was when adorned with more co&s;tly attire; indeed, I have &s;omewhere read, that beauty when unadorned, is adorned the mo&s;t&mdash;'tis a doctrine I am now determined to adopt, and, who knows, what may yet happen; if that maxim may be depended on, my days of conque&s;t are yet to begin, that is to &s;ay, I am to be more capable of it than ever.&mdash;I feared, you &s;ee, you &s;hould fancy I had lived to nearly my nineteenth year, without having done any execution, and, humbled as I am, felt my pride alarmed at &s;uch an idea&mdash;thank heaven,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
however, I am &s;etting out in my new plan of life, with my heart perfectly at ea&s;e&mdash;no &s;mall con|&s;olation that, let me tell you&mdash;not &s;o, my darling Orlando; and that pains it indeed, more than any other wound it could have re|ceived&mdash;he has <HI>now,</HI> I fear, a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion to &s;truggle with, be&s;ide all his other misfortunes&mdash;you are no &s;tranger to his atach|ment to the lovely Caroline, nor her wretch of a brother's rooted aver&s;ion to mine&mdash;an aver&s;ion, founded on his &s;uperiority; they were fellow collegians&mdash;he there conceived that envy for his &s;upe|rior talents; and the univer&s;al
<PB N="10" REF="12">
e&s;teem he met with from every creature, (him&s;elf excepted,) and by &s;ome other trifling circum|&s;tances which has &s;ince occurred, of which you have &s;een many proofs; it has, from that period, been his con&s;tant endeavour to do him every injury in his power, though, till now, he has met with few or no opportunities&mdash;and, there is nothing more certain, I firmly believe, than that.</P>
<Q><L>Forgivene&s;s to the injured does belong,</L>
<L>They never pardon, who have done the wrong.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> I &s;ay, he has it amply in his power, to mortify the amiable
<PB N="11" REF="13">
object of his aver&s;ion, &s;ince Ca|roline is, till of age, wholly in his power, then indeed &s;he may chu&s;e for her&s;elf; and I have every rea&s;on to believe her choice is al|ready made, but till then, &s;he cannot marry without the wretch's con&s;ent; this however, is not the wor&s;t; time would of cour&s;e re|move this ob&s;tacle, but the &s;cene is changed&mdash;my Orlando's &s;enti|ments are of a nature &s;o delicate, that I am fully per&s;uaded he will, or rather has, from the moment, he knew he had no longer a for|tune to offer, worthy her acccept|ance, given up every hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mi&s;tre&s;s of his tend|ere&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="14">
affections. Sir John will therefore be again di&s;appointed, in his hopes of mortifying him, for never will he put it in any woman's power, to &s;u&s;pect intere&s;t could have any influence over him. The lovely Caroline, I well know, would rejoice in thus having it in her power, to re&s;tore the man of her heart, to that affluence from which he has &s;o unhappily fallen, indeed, I can hardly form an idea of a greater gratification than that mu&s;t be to a noble mind, except being able, like Orlando, thus to &s;acrifice all his pro&s;pects of feli|city to his ideas of honor&mdash;'tis the pangs, which I am &s;en&s;ible, at this
<PB N="13" REF="15">
moment, wrings his generous heart, that pains mine mo&s;t, in this our fallen &s;tate&mdash;all other ills I can look forward to with tolerable for|titude; but where my brother's peace of mind is concerned, I feel mo&s;t &s;everely; 'tis only while re|flections on this &s;ubject occur, that my heroi&s;m for&s;akes me; 'tis then, I mourn our lo&s;s, and the little probability there is of his ever being &s;o happy as he ju&s;tly de&s;erves to be, or as my affectionate heart could wi&s;h&mdash;for, alas, we may truly be &s;tiled orphans. Since, I know not one relation we have in the world, on whom we have any po&s;&s;ible claim: my poor father,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
had no brothers&mdash;my amiable and ever to be lamented mother had but one, and he died when Or|lando and I were infants, at lea&s;t we have every rea&s;on to believe &s;o, as we have never heard of him &s;ince.&mdash;On Providence, Harriot we mu&s;t place our tru&s;t&mdash;but had we hundreds of relations, are there any on whom we could, or ought with &s;o much confidence to rely? &s;urely there are not, for they, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of millions, might behold our wants with an eye of indif|ference; all our hopes of &s;haring their wealth might po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;|appointed, for 'tis not tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s mo&s;t, who are always rea|die&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="17">
to be&s;tow&mdash;but, in putting our tru&s;t in Providence, we not only do our duty, but cannot fail in being rewarded, either in this world or a better&mdash;yet, alas, my dear Harriot, this, I fear, is in general, a la&s;t re&s;ource&mdash;certain it is, your poor I&s;abella has no other; I fear, if I had, you might not have found me capable of making &s;o many pious reflections.&mdash;I dare not too minutely enter into the &s;crutiny, con&s;cious, that 'tis much ea&s;ier to preach than practice&mdash;of this, however, I am ab&s;olutely certain, that the &s;entiments I have expre&s;&s;ed, are &s;uch, as I ought mo&s;t firmly to believe, and though my
<PB N="16" REF="18">
faith may be weak, I tru&s;t it will never wholly fail&mdash;do not be &s;hocked my dear Harriot, when I inform you where to addre&s;s your next letter, forget, as I endeavour to do, the elegant man&s;ion, in which I formerly enjoyed the plea&s;ure of your corre&s;pondence, reflect only, that your plea&s;ing epi&s;tles will now be doubly dear to me, robbed as I am, of &s;o many other &s;ources of &s;atisfaction,&mdash;do not &s;uffer a tear to drop on it in remembrance of the pa&s;t, 'tis fruitle&s;s, a thou&s;and things may yet happen to cheer my pre&s;ent pro&s;pects. I do not de&s;pair; and why, my good girl, &s;hould you:
<PB N="17" REF="19">
Let me find in your next your u&s;ual vivacity, <HI>that</HI> will help to re&s;tore mine, indeed, for my Or|lando's &s;ake, I will do my utmo&s;t, not only to <HI>appear,</HI> but really to <HI>be</HI> chearful; not for worlds, would I give him one moments unea&s;ine&s;s, nay, in this, and only this ca&s;e, would I deceive him; and, if po&s;&s;ible, per&s;uade him, I am more re&s;igned, than 'tis in nature to be&mdash;you have not, I am &s;ure, forgot our worthy teacher at Mrs. Ma&s;on's; &s;he was ever extremely partial, both to you and your I&s;abella; our governe&s;s, was of a more haughty, more forbid|ding ca&s;t; of cour&s;e, Mrs. Bell|mour

<PB N="19" REF="21">
my pride forbad my continuing in the country; I dreaded the pity of my former acquaintance, and tru&s;t I &s;hall never require it; as it is one of the lea&s;t plea&s;ing of all con|&s;olations, and for that rea&s;on, I fear, given &s;o freely.&mdash;In town, I can live as retired as I plea&s;e, and what is &s;till better, enjoy my Orlando's &s;ociety daily&mdash;he is now my only protector; could I then do better than take up my re&s;idence near him.&mdash;Mrs. Belmour is a woman of family, of a fine under&s;tanding, well bred, and accompli&s;hed; our &s;ituations are in &s;ome degree &s;imilar&mdash;true there is this difference; &s;he, though as
<PB N="20" REF="22">
I &s;aid, of a good family, never had hopes of a fortune: Her father was a younger brother&mdash;married again&s;t the con&s;ent of his friends; was never pardoned, and died when &s;he was an infant; &s;he was of cour&s;e brought up without higher views than &s;he has attained to; perhaps, her father's misfortunes might deter her from entering into the &s;tate of matrimony; be that as it will, &s;he never did, though &s;he has certainly been a fine woman in her day&mdash;with her, I doubt not I &s;hall find my&s;elf very com|modiou&s;ly &s;ituated; my faithful Fanny, begged to continue with me, indeed, I had no thoughts of

parting from her; but, when &s;he &s;aw all the other &s;ervants di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;he feared it was to be her fate al&s;o; &s;he is a good creature, and, I believe &s;incerely attached to me, indeed, having lived in our family, from a girl I can hardly doubt it&mdash;nor is this de&s;ire a &s;mall proof of it.&mdash;My dear Orlando wi&s;hed me much, al&s;o to retain my own man&mdash;but this I at once declared I would not con&s;ent to&mdash;could I po&s;&s;ibly think of putting him to an expence for a gratification I could &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;pence with&mdash;no, Harriot&mdash;far, far, rather would <HI>I</HI> make &s;hift with the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life, than encroach on his

<P>HERE I am, my deare&s;t Har|riot, and I a&s;&s;ure you, very comfortably &s;ettled&mdash;comfortably, you cry, &s;hocked at the homely phra&s;e&mdash;but why &s;hocked?&mdash;you have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to think of your I&s;abella, as enjoy|ing every elegance, every luxury of life, that the idea of being re|duced
<PB N="25" REF="27">
to the mere comfortable, it appears, I &s;uppo&s;e, a mighty <HI>uncomfortable</HI> expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;now, I, on the contrary, by ca&s;ting my eyes around me, and viewing the thou&s;ands who every moment pa&s;s my windows, vi&s;ibly de&s;titute of <HI>even that</HI> ble&s;&s;ing, think 'tis no &s;mall mercy, con&s;idering, that another unlucky ca&s;t of the dice, might have put me on a level with the mo&s;t wretched&mdash;'tis by reflecting in this manner, my dear Harriot, one finds con&s;olation; in fact, I have lo&s;t nothing e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s, were it not a truth, how very <HI>very</HI> few, in this world have any preten&s;ions to
<PB N="26" REF="28">
it&mdash;few I mean, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e, who are even in a far wor&s;e &s;ituation than I am at this mo|ment; have I not a kind affectionate brother, a friend, no le&s;s tenderly attached to me?&mdash;in &s;hort, I am de|termined to bid defiance to adver|&s;ity; I will bear it, not only with re&s;ignation, but, if po&s;&s;ible, cheer|fully, which I am po&s;itively certain, will &s;trip it of half its horrors; no more condolence then, no more fruitle&s;s repining, let us remember, this misfortune was brought upon us by a <HI>father,</HI> a kind, an in|dulgent, though an imprudent one; be his faults and failings forgot, and, may I ever reflect with gra|titude,
<PB N="27" REF="29">
on the thou&s;and benefits we have received from him&mdash;a good education, well informed under&s;tanding, &s;entiments we need not blu&s;h to acknowledge; the&s;e, Harriot, we owe to his paternal care, but for tho&s;e in&s;tructions, I might not have been able, as thank Heaven, I now can, to look back without a &s;igh, to tho&s;e ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, once ours&mdash;now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others, perhaps, le&s;s de&s;erving&mdash;why wonder at the fall of a private family&mdash;'tis a fate from which even the greate&s;t em|pires are not exempt&mdash;but, let me farther convince my kind Harriot, I am not an object of pity, by giv|ing
<PB N="28" REF="30">
her a more minute account of my &s;ituation; I found Mrs. Bell|mour's hou&s;e infinitely more <HI>ele|gant,</HI> yes, <HI>elegant,</HI> than I had any idea of; I have three apartments, which we will call my drawing room, dre&s;&s;ing room, and bed chamber, more than that number I did not a&s;pire to, in my father's hou&s;e, 'tis true, my &s;econd is not quite &s;o &s;pacious as my former one there, but for that very rea&s;on, is now preferable, as it is more &s;uitable to my circum&s;tances&mdash;the furniture is all chintz&mdash;my dear Orlando, has &s;upplied me with a few well cho&s;en books; I have my harp&s;ichord, my materials for
<PB N="29" REF="31">
drawing; and, as for all &s;orts of elegant works, have only to &s;tep down to Mrs. Bellmour, and there I may at all times, &s;ee and copy the greate&s;t variety&mdash;&s;he is de|lighted with the honor I have done her, in making choice of her hou&s;e, and pays me as much re|&s;pect, as if &s;he were a &s;tranger to my misfortunes; &s;he has no other lodgers, though &s;he has another &s;et of apartments, as good as mine, which &s;he can &s;pare, but has made a point of taking no per&s;on, who is not particulaly recommended, nor is &s;he very anxious about it, as &s;he is in a fair way to make a fortune in a few years, by her bu|&s;ine&s;s&mdash;
<PB N="30" REF="32">
now, tell me, hone&s;tly, have I not great rea&s;on to ble&s;s Heaven, that I &s;till enjoy &s;o many comforts&mdash;&s;urely, I have&mdash;you'll perhaps, tell me, I am excluded from all &s;ociety, or at lea&s;t, from &s;uch as I have hitherto been ac|cu&s;tomed to&mdash;'tis very true, and &s;ociety is undoubtedly, the fir&s;t &s;atisfaction in life&mdash;but, though I had a numerous acquaintance, it by no means follows, that in their company, I found what <HI>I call</HI> &s;ociety&mdash;'tis, in my opinion, a thing no longer under&s;tood, 'tis &s;till like friend&s;hip, much talked of, but where do we find it&mdash;not at public places, not at card par|ties,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
&s;ociety, according to my ideas, con&s;i&s;ts in rational conver&s;ation, with &s;en&s;ible well informed peo|ple&mdash;where are they to be met with? that there are many &s;uch, I make no doubt, but, what avails it&mdash;a man, or woman, of &s;uperior under&s;tanding, makes no better figure&mdash;nay, I am apt to think, a wor&s;e figure at a public place, or, card a&s;&s;embly, than one who can only talk of the weather&mdash;the fa&s;hions, the opera, or the la&s;t new play&mdash;and, where does one meet any &s;oul, but at places of this nature? not in London; &s;o my lo&s;s, you &s;ee, is not great in that article&mdash;do you, Harriot, in
<PB N="32" REF="34">
your con&s;cience, think they un|der&s;tand the matter much better in the country&mdash;I do not&mdash;during the few months people of fa&s;hion &s;pend there, do they not to the utmo&s;t of their power, live exactly as they do in town&mdash;where then is &s;ociety to be found&mdash;I &s;ay, 'tis wholly aboli&s;hed, and in its &s;tead, we have only an eternal round of in&s;ipid di&s;&s;ipation, in which, as I &s;aid above, the fool, makes ju&s;t as good a figure as the man of &s;en&s;e&mdash;I never pa&s;&s;ed a winter in town, except one&mdash;and upon my honor, I never was &s;o tired of any &s;ix months, &s;ince I was born, yet, I was then in the fir&s;t company,
<PB N="33" REF="35">

<P>I HAVE &s;ince you la&s;t heard from me, my dear Lady Bell, met with a trifle which gave (and very fooli&s;hly) half an hour's unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;not more, for a moment's cool reflection con|vinced
<PB N="88" REF="90">
me, 'twas an artifice of my brothers, and his friend, Sir James Hender&s;on&mdash;but take the particulars.</P>
<P>A few days ago we had dined, <HI>tete a tete</HI>&mdash;he was in better temper than u&s;ual, not a word of the colonel was &s;aid&mdash;'tis a &s;ubject <HI>I</HI> never &s;tart, though of all others, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me; he cho&s;e to be very eloquent in prai&s;e of Sir James, was <HI>a&s;toni&s;hed</HI> I did not &s;ee him in the &s;ame favourable light, &s;o fine a fortune&mdash;&s;uch great connections, &amp;c. and then &s;o di&s;tractedly in love with me, &s;o con&s;tant, in &s;pite of the cold

<P>On his quitting the room, I ob|&s;erved a letter lying by the chair he had &s;at on&mdash;it was open&mdash;I cannot &s;ay I felt any &s;ort of cu|rio&s;ity to view the contents, nor &s;hould I, had I not, by mere chance, &s;een the name of Rochley;

I am now per&s;uaded he had dropped it in that open manner, that I might &s;ee it, &s;en&s;ible, nothing le&s;s would tempt me to peru&s;e it, and in this in&s;tance, he really did di&s;cover &s;ome &s;hare of &s;agacity.</P>

<P>You may make your&s;elf perfectly ea&s;y, would I could hope the news

to this, he very wi&s;ely agreed, and they are to be married without farther ceremony, next week.&mdash;What I tell you, you may de|pend upon as a fact, for I had it from the girls brother, (father &s;he has none) and he cur&s;es her for a fool&mdash;&s;o you may make your|&s;elf ea&s;y, no fear of his being grafted into your family <HI>now.</HI>&mdash;One thing I make a point of; not a word of this to your &s;i&s;ter, I wi&s;h not to be the fir&s;t who &s;hall inform her of it, &s;he may per|haps fancy I am mean enough to triumph on the occa&s;ion&mdash;I do not&mdash;I own I cannot help being

</LETTER>
<P>How do you like it Lady Bell?&mdash;artful, and really better manu|factered than I believed either of them capable of&mdash;I hope you will own it was enough to &s;tagger one at the fir&s;t reading&mdash;I confe&s;s it did me&mdash;for after all, men are but men.
<PB N="95" REF="97">
However, I am fully determined not to believe one word of the matter&mdash;and, as I love to do things openly and hone&s;tly, I have treated my colonel with a copy of it, inclo&s;ed in a few lines from my&s;elf; civilly de&s;iring he will him&s;elf tell me, whether there is any truth in it, as I would &s;ooner take his word, than that of any other per&s;on&mdash;at the &s;ame time, adding my opinion, which as I have already told you is, that 'tis an abominable fal&s;ehood&mdash;I did not think it quite convenient to tell <HI>him,</HI> who was the eloquent author of this epi&s;tle, <HI>that</HI> might
<PB N="96" REF="98">
have led to di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences&mdash;but, what you will grant, is &s;till a better joke, I have taken no notice of having found it, though, that it was dropped on purpo&s;e for me to pick up, is as clear as noon day&mdash;I could expire with laughing at the thoughts of my having thus di&s;appointed the dear creatures, by pretending to know nothing of the matter.</P>
<P>When we met at tea&mdash;I found my brother was brimfull of ex|pectation&mdash;I affected to be more gay, more lively than u&s;ual&mdash;yet, took care not to over act my part; I
<PB N="97" REF="99">
was humming a favourite air, when he came in, and continued it; he was vi&s;ibly in the fidgets&mdash;tried fir&s;t one chair, then an|other&mdash;but all in vain&mdash;I made the tea with all imaginable com|po&s;ure&mdash;and at la&s;t, finding I would not break the ice, and of cour&s;e, fearing the matter would come to an untimely end, if he did not lend a helping hand to re&s;tore it.</P>
<P>Caroline &s;aid he, looking very like a fool; pray did you find a letter? I have dropped one &s;ome where, and cannot, for my &s;oul, find it.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">
You &s;ee, my dear Lady Bell, I had nothing for it, but to tell an ab&s;o|lute <HI>lye</HI> mincing the matter would have &s;poiled the joke&mdash;no, replied I, I really &s;aw none&mdash;no, cried he, &s;hocked to death at the very idea that his plot &s;hould have mi&s;|carried&mdash;&s;urely you mu&s;t, for I am pretty certain, I had it in my pocket at dinner&mdash;are you equally certain, &s;aid I, you have not lo&s;t it out of doors?

perhaps, or &s;ome of them may have picked it up&mdash;I hope it is of no great importance, in ca&s;e it is not to be &s;ound?&mdash;this was an aukward &s;ort of a que&s;tion, was it not, my dear Lady Bell? he felt it to be &s;o, and looked more fooli&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible, than before, and waved giving an an&s;wer&mdash;I rung the bell&mdash;John &s;tep into the dining room, and &s;ee if you can find a letter there, your ma&s;ter has dropped one, and fancies it was in that room&mdash;away went John.</P>
<P>I need hardly tell you the poor epi&s;tle was not to be found&mdash;make

farther enquiries &s;aid I, among&s;t the &s;ervants, &s;ome of them may have got it&mdash;lo&s;t, it cannot be, <HI>in the</HI> hou&s;e, and, unle&s;s there were bank bills in it, I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e any of them can have motives for, not re&s;toring it&mdash;I hope it contained none, brother.</P>
<P>Such was the command I had of my countenance, my dear friend, that, I &s;aw plainly, I had fairly taken him in&mdash;no, you never &s;aw mortal in &s;o ridiculous a &s;itu|ation&mdash;'tis impo&s;&s;ible to conceive it&mdash;what was now to be done? here was a fine well concerted plot blown to air, he had &s;en&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="103">
enough to &s;ee, that telling me the contents would never do&mdash;'twas too late&mdash;I &s;hould immediately &s;u&s;pect he had dropped it on pur|po&s;e, or, why not have told me the mighty news at <HI>dinner,</HI> if he could do it now&mdash;this argument might have no weight, had the bu&s;ine&s;s been of an hone&s;t nature&punc; I am &s;en&s;ible&mdash;but, here the ca&s;e was different, he <HI>felt</HI> I &s;hould not believe one word of the &s;tory, if told &s;imply, without all the coro|berating circum&s;tances contained in the unfortunate epi&s;tle&mdash;it was to do it ju&s;tice, wrote mo&s;t plau|&s;ibly&mdash;Sir James begging <HI>he would not</HI> inform me of it, for in|&s;tance
<PB N="102" REF="104">
&mdash;how <HI>now,</HI> tell it without di&s;obeying that injunction, and of cour&s;e, robbing his poor friend of the merit, he hoped to acquire, by that very <HI>injunction:</HI> This was a dilema not to be got over.</P>
<P>What then could the &s;illy &s;oul do better than let the matter drop? and this, he very prudently did&mdash;whether this di&s;a&s;ter will cure them of ploting, heaven only knows&mdash;you &s;ee not a doubt re|mains with me, that it was a plot&mdash;though I have not yet had it cleared up, by my dear Rochley.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105">
This I hope to have in a few days, as I have taken effectual care, neither <HI>my</HI> letter, nor <HI>his</HI> an&s;wer &s;hall again fall into my brothers hands&mdash;and he, I fancy, fearing his an&s;wer to his confederate, might, by &s;ome unlucky chance, fall into mine, has thought proper to &s;et off full &s;peed, for London, to tell the &s;tory in per&s;on</P>

<P>On this unfortunate occa&s;ion, however, I fear &s;he meant it lite|rally; and to mend the matter, we were no &s;ooner &s;eated in the car|riage, than he cried, what a lovely creature was that we have ju&s;t &s;een!&mdash;Where, for heavens &s;ake? a&s;k|ed Lady B.

<P>Now, Harriot, you mu&s;t know as Lord Templeton and I are not likely to be farther acquainted, though to &s;ay truth, he has done his utmo&s;t endeavours towards it, I have &s;ome thoughts of &s;etting my cap at this old neighbour of mine that is to be, he is it &s;eems a man of fortune, and &s;hould&punc; I find it equal to my ambition, I will give him credit for all other perfections.
