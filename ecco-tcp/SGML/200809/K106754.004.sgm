<HEAD>A letter from Giffard, Lord Elmwood's Hou&s;e Steward, to Mi&s;s Woodley.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Lord, above a twelvemonth ago, acquainted me he had permitted his daughter to re&s;ide in his hou&s;e; but at the &s;ame time he informed me, the grant was under a certain re&s;tric|tion,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
which if ever broken, I was to &s;ee his then determination (of which he al&s;o acquainted me) put in execu|tion. In con&s;equence of Lady Ma|tilda's indi&s;po&s;ition, Madam, I have ventured to delay this notice till morn|ing&mdash;I need not &s;ay with what con|cern I now give it, or mention to you I believe, what is forfeited. &mdash; My Lord &s;taid but a few hours ye&s;ter|day after the unhappy circum&s;tance on which I write, took place; nor did I &s;ee him after, till he was in his carriage; he then &s;ent for me to the carriage door, and told me he &s;hould be back in two days time, and added 'Remember your duty.' That duty, I hope, Madam, you will not require I &s;hould mention in more direct terms. &mdash;As &s;oon as my Lord returns, I have no doubt but he will a&s;k me if it is
<PB N="3" REF="4">
fulfilled, and I &s;hall be under the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ion &s;hould his com|mands not be obeyed.</P>
<P>If there is any thing wanting for the convenience of your and Lady Matilda's departure, you have but to order it, and it is at your &s;ervice&mdash; I mean likewi&s;e any ca&s;h you may have occa&s;ion for. I &s;hould pre&s;ume to add my opinion where you might be&s;t take up your abode; but with &s;uch ad|vice as you will have from Mr. Sand|ford, mine would be but a&s;&s;uming.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o have waited upon you, Madam, and have delivered my&s;elf the &s;ub&s;tance of this letter; but I am an old man, and the changes I have been witne&s;s to in my Lord's hou&s;e &s;ince I fir&s;t lived in it, has en|crea&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="5">
my age many years; and I have not the &s;trength to &s;ee you upon this occa&s;ion. &mdash; I loved my decea&s;ed Lady&mdash;I love my Lord&mdash;and I love their child &mdash; nay, &s;o I am &s;ure does my Lord him&s;elf; but there is no ac|counting for his re&s;olutions, or for the alteration his di&s;po&s;ition has lately un+dergone.</P>
<P>I beg pardon, Madam, for this long intru&s;ion, and am, and ever will be (while you and my Lord's daugh|ter are &s;o) your afflicted humble &s;er|vant,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">When this letter was brought to Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;he knew what it contained before &s;he opened it, and therefore took it with an air of re&s;ignation&mdash;yet though &s;he gue&s;&s;ed the momentous part of its contents, &s;he dreaded in what words it might be related; and having now no great good to hope for, hope, that will never totally expire, clung at this cri&s;is to little circum&s;tances, and &s;he hoped mo&s;t fervently the terms of the letter might not be har&s;h, but that Lord Elm|wood had delivered his commands in gentle language.&mdash;The event proved he had; and lo&s;t to every important com|fort, &s;he felt grateful to him for this &s;mall one.</P>
<P>Matilda, too, was cheared by this let|ter, becau&s;e &s;he expected &s;omething wor&s;e; and the la&s;t line where Giffard
<PB N="6" REF="7">
&s;aid he knew "his Lord&s;hip loved her." &s;he thought repaid her for the purport of the other part.</P>
<P>Sandford was not &s;o ea&s;ily re&s;igned or comforted &mdash; he walked about the room when the letter was &s;hewn to him&mdash;called it cruel &mdash; &s;tifled his tears, and wi&s;hed to &s;how his re&s;entment only &mdash; but the former bur&s;t through all his endeavours, and he &s;unk into grief.</P>
<P>Nor was the fortitude of Matilda, which came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the fir&s;t on&s;et of this trial, &s;ufficient to arm her, when the moment came &s;he was to quit the hou&s;e&mdash; her father's hou&s;e &mdash; never to &s;ee that, or him again.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">When word was brought that the car|riage was at the door, which was to con|vey her from all &s;he held &s;o dear, and &s;he &s;aw before her the pro&s;pect of a long youthful and healthful life, in which mi&s;ery and de&s;pair were all &s;he could di&s;cern; that de&s;pair &s;eized her at once, and gaining courage from it, &s;he cried</P>
<P>"What have I to fear if I di&s;obey my father's commands once more? &mdash; he cannot u&s;e me wor&s;e.&mdash;I'll &s;tay here till he returns&mdash;again throw my&s;elf in his way, and then I will not faint, but plead for mercy. &mdash; Perhaps were I to kneel to him &mdash; kneel, like other chil|dren, and beg his ble&s;&s;ing; he would not refu&s;e it me."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not try." &s;aid Sandford mildly.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">"Who?" cried &s;he, "&s;hall prevent my flying to my father?&mdash;have I another friend on earth to go to?&mdash;have I one relation in the world but him?&mdash;This is the &s;econd time I have been commanded out of the hou&s;e.&mdash;In my in&s;ant &s;tate my cruel father turned me out; but then he &s;ent me to a mother&mdash;now I have none; and I will &s;tay with him."</P>
<P>Again the &s;teward &s;ent to let them know the coach was waiting.</P>
<P>Sandford now, with a determined countenance, went coolly up to Lady Matilda, and taking her hand, &s;eemed re&s;olved to lead her to the carriage.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed to be awed by every &s;e|rious look of his, &s;he yet re&s;i&s;ted this; and cried "Would <HI>you</HI> be the mini&s;ter of my father's cruelty?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">"Then," &s;aid Sandford &s;olemnly to her, "farewell&mdash;from this moment you and I part.&mdash;I will take my leave, and do you remain where you are &mdash; at lea&s;t till you are forced away.&mdash;But I'll not &s;tay to be turned out &mdash; for it is impo&s;&s;ible your fa|ther will &s;uffer any friend of yours to continue here, after this di&s;obedience.&mdash; Adieu."</P>
<P>"I'll go this moment." &s;aid &s;he, and ro&s;e ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley took her at her word, and hurried her immediately out of the room.</P>
<P>Sandford followed &s;low behind, with the &s;ame &s;pirits as if he had followed at her funeral.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to that &s;pot on the &s;tairs where &s;he had met her father, &s;he &s;tarted back; and &s;carcely knew how to
<PB N="10" REF="11">
pa&s;s it. &mdash; When &s;he had &mdash; "There he held me," &s;aid &s;he, "and I thought I felt him pre&s;s me to his heart, but I now find I was mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>As Sandford came forward to hand her into the coach, "Now you behave well;" &s;aid he, "by this behaviour, you do not entirely clo&s;e all pro&s;pect of reconci|liation with your father.</P>
<P>"Do you think it is not yet impo&s;|&s;ible?" cried &s;he, cla&s;ping his hand. "Giffard &s;ays he loves me," continued &s;he, "and do you think he might yet be brought to forgive me?"</P>
<P>"Forgive you?" cried Sandford.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e I was to write to him, and entreat his forgivene&s;s."</P>
<P>"Do not write yet." &s;aid Sandford with no chearing accent.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">The carriage drove off &mdash; and as it went, Matilda leaned her head from the window, to &s;urvey Elmwood Hou&s;e from the roof to the bottom. &mdash; She ca&s;t her eyes upon the gardens too &mdash; upon the fi&s;hponds&mdash;the coach hou&s;es even, and all the offices adjoining&mdash;which as objects &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee again &mdash; &s;he gazed at, as objects of importance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>RUSHBROOK, who at twenty miles di&s;tance, could have no conjecture what had pa&s;&s;ed at Elmwood Hou&s;e, (during the &s;hort vi&s;it Lord Elmwood made there) went that way with his dogs and gun in order to meet his Lord&s;hip's charriot on its return and ride with him back &mdash; he did &s;o &mdash; and getting into the carriage, told my Lord eagerly the &s;port he had had during the day; laughed at an ac|cident that had befallen one of his dogs, and for &s;ome time did not perceive but that his Lord&s;hip was perfectly attentive. &mdash;At length, ob&s;erving he an&s;wered more negligently than u&s;ual to what he &s;aid,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
Ru&s;hbrook turned his eyes quickly upon him and cried,</P>
<P>"My Lord, are you not well?"</P>
<P>"Yes; perfectly well, I thank you, Ru&s;hbrook." replied his Lord&s;hip, and leaned back again&s;t the carriage.</P>
<P>"I thought, Sir," returned Ru&s;h|brook, "you &s;poke languidly; I beg your pardon."</P>
<P>"I have the head-ake a little." an|&s;wered he;&mdash;Then taking off his hat, bru&s;hed the powder from it, and as he put it on again, fetched a mo&s;t heavy &s;igh; which no &s;ooner had e&s;caped him, than, to drown its &s;ound, he &s;aid bri&s;kly,</P>
<P>"And &s;o you tell me you have had good &s;port to-day?"</P>
<P>"No, my Lord, I &s;aid but indiffe|rent."</P>
<P>"True, &s;o you did. &mdash; Bid the man
<PB N="14" REF="15">
drive fa&s;ter &mdash; it will be dark before we get home."</P>
<P>"You will &s;hoot to-morrow, my Lord?"</P>
<P>"Certainly."</P>
<P>"How does Mr. Sandford do, Sir?"</P>
<P>"I did not &s;ee him."</P>
<P>"Not &s;ee Mr. Sandford, my Lord?&mdash; but he was out, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;for they did not expect you at Elmwood Hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"No, they did not."</P>
<P>In &s;uch conver&s;ation Ru&s;hbrook and his uncle continued till the end of their journey.&mdash;Dinner was then immediately &s;erved, and his Lord&s;hip now appeared much in his u&s;ual &s;pirits; at lea&s;t not &s;u&s;pecting any cau&s;e for their abatement, Ru&s;hbrook did not ob&s;erve any alte|ration.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">Lord Elmwood went however earlier of bed than ordinary, or rather to his bedchamber; for though he retired &s;ome time before his nephew, when Ru&s;h|brook pa&s;&s;ed his chamber door it was open; and he not in bed, but &s;itting in a mu&s;ing po&s;ture as if he had forgot to &s;hut it.</P>
<P>When Ru&s;hbrook's valet came to at|tend his ma&s;ter, he &s;aid to him,</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you do not know what has happened at Elmwood Hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake what?" cried Ru&s;hbrook.</P>
<P>"My Lord has met Lady Matilda." replied the man.</P>
<P>"How? Where? What's the con|&s;equence?"</P>
<P>"We don't know yet, Sir; but all the &s;ervants &s;uppo&s;e, her Lady&s;hip will
<PB N="16" REF="17">
not be &s;uffered to remain there any longer."</P>
<P>"They all &s;uppo&s;e wrong," returned Ru&s;hbrook ha&s;tily; "my Lord loves her I am certain, and this event may be the happy means, of his treating her as his child, from this day."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant &s;miled and &s;hook his head.</P>
<P>"Why, what more do you know?"</P>
<P>"Nothing more than I have told you, Sir; except that his Lord&s;hip took no kind of notice of her Lady&s;hip, that appeared like love."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was all unea&s;ine&s;s and anx|iety to know the particulars of what had pa&s;&s;ed; and now Lord Elmwood's in|quietude, which he had but &s;lightly no|ticed before, came full to his ob&s;erva|tion. &mdash; He was going to a&s;k more que&s;|tions,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
but he recollected Lady Matilda's misfortunes were too &s;acred, to be talked of thus familiarly by the &s;ervants of the family; &mdash; be&s;ides, it was evident this man thought, and but naturally, it might not be for his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t the father and the daughter &s;hould be united; and therefore would certainly give to all he &s;aid the oppo&s;ite colouring.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of his prudence, however, and his delicacy towards Matilda, Ru&s;h|brook could not let his valet leave him till he had inquired, and learnt all the circum&s;tantial account of what had hap|pened; except, indeed, the order re|ceived by Giffard; which being given after his Lord&s;hip was in his carriage, and in conci&s;e terms, the dome&s;tics who attended him (and from whom this man
<PB N="18" REF="19">
had gained his intelligence) were of that unacquainted.</P>
<P>When the valet had left Ru&s;hbrook alone, the perturbation of his mind was &s;o great, that he was at length undeter|mined whether to go to bed, or to ru&s;h into his uncle's apartment, and at his feet beg for that compa&s;&s;ion upon his daughter, which he feared he had de|nied her.&mdash;But then again, to what dan|gers did he not expo&s;e him&s;elf by &s;uch a &s;tep? Nay, he might perhaps even in|jure her whom he wi&s;hed to &s;erve; for if his Lord&s;hip was at pre&s;ent unre&s;olved whether to forgive or to re&s;ent this di&s;|obedience to his commands, another's interference might enrage, and determine him on the latter.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration was &s;o weighty it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;igned Ru&s;hbrook to the &s;u&s;pen&s;e he
<PB N="19" REF="20">
mu&s;t endure till the morning; when he flattered him&s;elf, that by watching every look and motion of Lord Elmwood's, his penetration would be able to di&s;cover the &s;tate of his heart, and how he meant to act.</P>
<P>But the morning came, and he found all his prying curio&s;ity was of no avail; his Lord&s;hip did not u&s;e one word, one look, or action that was not cu&s;tomary.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t &s;eeing him, Ru&s;hbrook blu&s;h|ed at the &s;ecret with which he was en|tru&s;ted; then contemplated the joy he ought to have known in cla&s;ping in his arms a child like Matilda &mdash; who&s;e ten|derne&s;s, reverence, and duty had de|prived her of all &s;en&s;ation at his &s;ight; which was in Ru&s;hbrook's mind an ho|nour,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
that rendered him &s;uperior to what he was before.</P>
<P>They were in the fields all the day as u&s;ual; Lord Elmwood now chearful, and complaining no more of the head|ake.&mdash;Yet once being &s;eparated from his nephew, Ru&s;hbrook cro&s;&s;ed over a &s;tile into another field, and found him &s;itting by the &s;ide of a bank, his gun laying by him, and he lo&s;t in thought. He ro&s;e on &s;eeing him, and proceeded to the &s;port as before.</P>
<P>At dinner, he &s;aid he &s;hould not go to Elmwood Hou&s;e the next day, as he had appointed, but &s;tay where he was, three or four days longer. &mdash; From the&s;e two &s;mall occurrences, Ru&s;hbrook would fain have extracted &s;omething by which to judge the &s;tate of his mind; but upon
<PB N="21" REF="22">
the te&s;t, that was impo&s;&s;ible &mdash; he had caught him mu&s;ing many a time before; and as to his prolonging his &s;tay, that might ari&s;e from the &s;port &mdash; or, indeed, had any thing more material &s;wayed him, who could penetrate whether it was the effect of the lenity, or the &s;everity, he had dealt towards his child? whether his continuance there was to &s;hun her, or to &s;hun the hou&s;e from whence he had turned her?</P>
<P>The three or four days for their abode where they were, being pa&s;&s;ed, they both returned together to Elmwood Hou&s;e. &mdash; Ru&s;hbrook thought he &s;aw his uncle's countenance change as they en|tered the avenue, yet he did not appear le&s;s in &s;pirits; and when Sandford joined them at dinner, his Lord&s;hip went with his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s to him, and (as was his cu&s;tom after any &s;eparation) put
<PB N="22" REF="23">
out his hand chearfully to take his. &mdash; Sandford &s;aid, "How do you do, my Lord?" chearfully in return; but put both his hands into his bo&s;om, and walk|ed to the other &s;ide of the room.&mdash;Lord Elmwood did not &s;eem to ob&s;erve this affront&mdash;nor was it done as an affront&mdash; it was merely what poor Sandford felt; and he felt he could <HI>not</HI> &s;hake hands with him.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook &s;oon learnt the news that Matilda was gone, and Elmwood Hou&s;e was to him a de&s;ert&mdash;he &s;aw about it no real friend of hers, except poor Sand|ford, and to him Ru&s;hbrook knew him&s;elf now, more di&s;plea&s;ing than ever; and all the overtures he made to him to be friends, he at this time, found more and more ineffectual.&mdash;Matilda was bani&s;hed; and her &s;uppo&s;ed triumphant rival was, to
<PB N="23" REF="24">
Sandford, more odious than he ever had been.</P>
<P>In alleviation of their bani&s;hment, Mi&s;s Woodley with her charge had not returned to their old retreat; but were gone to a large farm hou&s;e, no more than about thirty miles from Lord Elmwood's: here Sandford with little inconvenience vi&s;ited them; nor did his Lord&s;hip ever take any notice of his occa&s;ional ab&s;ence; for as he had before given his daughter, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to his charge; &s;o honour, delicacy, and the common ties of duty, made him approve rather than condemn his atten|tion to her.</P>
<P>Though Sandford's frequent vi&s;its &s;oothed Matilda, they could not com|fort her; for he had no con&s;olation to
<PB N="24" REF="25">
be&s;tow &s;uited to her mind &mdash; her father had given no one token of regret for what he had done. He had even in|quired &s;ternly of Giffard on his returning home,</P>
<P>"If Mi&s;s Woodley had left the hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>The &s;teward gue&s;&s;ing the whole of his meaning, an&s;wered, "Yes, my Lord; and <HI>all</HI> your commands in that re&s;pect have been obeyed."</P>
<P>He replied, "I am &s;atisfied." and, to the grief of the old man, appeared really &s;o.</P>
<P>To the farm hou&s;e, the place of Ma|tilda's re&s;idence, there came, be&s;ides Sandford, another vi&s;itor far le&s;s wel|come; Vi&s;count Margrave. &mdash; He had heard with &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;till greater joy,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
that Lord Elmwood had once more &s;hut his doors again&s;t his daughter. &mdash; In this her di&s;carded &s;tate, his Lord&s;hip no lon|ger burthened his lively imagination with the dull thoughts of Marriage, but once more formed the brutal idea of making her his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Ignorant of a certain decorum which attended all Lord Elmwood's actions, he &s;u&s;pected his child might be in want; and an acquaintance with the wor&s;t part of her &s;ex informed him, relief from poverty was the &s;ure bargain for his &s;uc|ce&s;s.&mdash;With the&s;e hopes, he again paid Mi&s;s Woodley and her a vi&s;it; but the coldne&s;s with which he was &s;till received by the fir&s;t, and the haughtine&s;s with which the la&s;t, &s;till kept him at a di&s;|tance, again made him fear to give one allu&s;ion of his purpo&s;e: but he returned
<PB N="26" REF="27">
home re&s;olved to write what he dur&s;t not &s;peak &mdash; he did &s;o &mdash; he offered his &s;er|vices, his pur&s;e, his hou&s;e; they were rejected with contempt, and a &s;till &s;tronger prohibition given to his vi&s;its.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Elmwood had now allowed Ru&s;hbrook a long vacation, in re&s;pect to his an&s;wer upon the &s;ubject of marriage; and the young man vainly imagined, his Lord&s;hip's intentions upon that &s;ubject were entirely given up. &mdash; One morning however, as he was attending him in the library,</P>
<P>"Henry"&mdash;&s;aid his Lord&s;hip, with a pau&s;e at the beginning of his &s;peech, which indicated he was going to &s;ay &s;omething of importance, "Henry&mdash; you have not forgot the di&s;cour&s;e I had with you, a little time previous to your illne&s;s?"</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">Henry he&s;itated &mdash; for he wi&s;hed to have forgotten it&mdash;but it was too &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind. His uncle re&s;umed:</P>
<P>"What, equivocating again, Sir?&mdash; Do you remember it, or do you not?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yes, my Lord, I do."</P>
<P>"And are you prepared to give me an an&s;wer?"</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook pau&s;ed again.</P>
<P>"In our former conver&s;ation," his Lord&s;hip continued, "I gave you but a week to determine&mdash;there is, I think, clap&s;ed &s;ince that time, half a year."</P>
<P>"About as much, Sir."</P>
<P>"Then &s;urely you have now made up your mind?"</P>
<P>"I had done that, at fir&s;t, my Lord&mdash; provided it had met with your concur|rence."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">"You wi&s;hed to lead a bachelor's life, I think you &s;aid."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook bowed.</P>
<P>"Contrary to my will?"</P>
<P>"No, my Lord, I wi&s;hed to have your approbation."</P>
<P>"And you wi&s;hed for my approba|tion of the very contrary thing to that I propo&s;ed? &mdash; But I am not &s;urpri&s;ed &mdash; &s;uch is the gratitude of the world&mdash;and &s;uch is yours."</P>
<P>"My Lord, if you doubt my grati|tude"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Give me a proof of it, Harry, and I will doubt of it no longer."</P>
<P>"Upon every other &s;ubject but this, my Lord, heaven is my witne&s;s your happine&s;s"&mdash;</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip interrupted him. "I under&s;tand you &mdash; upon every other &s;ub|ject, but the only one, my content requires,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
you are ready to obey me.&mdash;I thank you."</P>
<P>"My Lord, do not torture me with this &s;u&s;picion; it is &s;o contrary to my de|&s;erts, I cannot bear it."</P>
<P>"Su&s;picion of your ingratitude!&mdash;you judge too favourably of my opinion;&mdash;it amounts to certainty."</P>
<P>"Then to convince you, Sir, I am not ungrateful,&mdash;tell me who the lady is you have cho&s;en for me, and here I give you my word, I will &s;acrifice all my fu|ture pro&s;pects of happine&s;s&mdash;all, for which I would wi&s;h to live &mdash; and become her hu&s;band, as &s;oon as you &s;hall appoint."</P>
<P>This was &s;poken with a tone &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ive of de&s;pair, that Lord Elmwood replied,</P>
<P>"And while you obey me, you take care to let me know, it will co&s;t you your future happine&s;s. &mdash; This is, I &s;up|po&s;e,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
to enhance the merit of the obliga|tion&mdash;but I &s;hall not accept your acqui|e&s;cence on the&s;e terms."</P>
<P>"Then in di&s;pen&s;ing with it, I hope Sir, for your pardon!"</P>
<P>"Do you &s;uppo&s;e, Ru&s;hbrook, I can pardon an offence, the &s;ole foundation of which, ari&s;es from a &s;pirit of di&s;obe|dience? &mdash;for you have declared to me your affections are di&s;engaged.&mdash;In our la&s;t conver&s;ation did you not &s;ay &s;o?"</P>
<P>"At fir&s;t I did, my Lord &mdash; but you permitted me to con&s;ult my heart more clo&s;ely; and I have found I was mi&s;|taken."</P>
<P>"You then own you at fir&s;t told me a fal&s;ehood, and yet have all this time, kept me in &s;u&s;pence without confe&s;&s;ing it."</P>
<P>"I waited, Sir, till you &s;hould en|quire"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">"You have then Sir, waited too long." And the fire fla&s;hed from his eyes.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook now found him&s;elf in that perilous &s;tate, that admitted of no me|dium of re&s;entment, but by &s;uch da&s;tard|ly conduct on his part, as would wound both his truth and courage; &mdash; and thus animated by his danger, he was re|&s;olved to plunge boldly at once into the depth of his patron's anger.</P>
<P>"My Lord," &s;aid he, (but he did not undertake this ta&s;k without &s;u&s;tain|ing the trembling and convul&s;ion of his whole frame) "My Lord &mdash; waving for a moment the &s;ubject of my marriage&mdash; permit me to remind you, that when I was upon my &s;ick bed, you promi&s;ed, that on my recovery, you would li&s;ten to a petition I had to offer you."</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">"Let me recollect."&mdash;&s;aid his Lord|&s;hip. "Yes &mdash; I remember &s;omething of it.&mdash;But I &s;aid nothing to warrant any improper petition."</P>
<P>"Its impropriety was not named, my Lord."</P>
<P>"No matter&mdash;that, you your&s;elf mu&s;t judge of, and an&s;wer for the con&s;e|quences."</P>
<P>"I would an&s;wer with my life, wil|lingly&mdash;but I own I &s;hrink from your anger."</P>
<P>"Then do not provoke it."</P>
<P>"I have already gone too far to re|cede&mdash;and you would of cour&s;e demand an explanation, if I attempted to &s;top here."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould."</P>
<P>"Then, my Lord, I am bound to to &s;peak&mdash;but do not interrupt me&mdash;hear
<PB N="34" REF="35">
me out, before you bani&s;h me from your &s;ight for ever."</P>
<P>"I will, Sir." replied his Lord&s;hip, prepared to hear &s;omething that would di&s;plea&s;e him, and yet determined to hear with patience to the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Then, my Lord" &mdash; (cried Ru&s;h|brook in the greate&s;t agitation both of mind and body) "Your daughter"&mdash;</P>
<P>The re&s;olution his Lord&s;hip had taken (and on which he had given his word to his nephew not to interrupt him) imme|diately gave way. &mdash;The colour ro&s;e in his face&mdash;his eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted lightning &mdash; and his hand was lifted up with the emotion, that word had created.</P>
<P>"You promi&s;ed to hear me, my Lord;" cried Ru&s;hbrook, "and I claim your promi&s;e."</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip now &s;uddenly overcame his violence of pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;tood &s;ilent
<PB N="35" REF="36">
and re&s;igned to hear him; but with a determined look, expre&s;&s;ive of the ven|geance that &s;hould en&s;ue.</P>
<P>"Lady Matilda," re&s;umed Ru&s;h|brook, "is an object that wre&s;ts from me the enjoyment of every ble&s;&s;ing your kindne&s;s be&s;tows. &mdash;I cannot but feel my|&s;elf as her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dver&s;ary &mdash; as one who has &s;uppl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nted her in your affections &mdash; who &s;upplies her place, while &s;he is exiled, a wander&punc; and an orphan."</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off his eyes from Ru&s;hbrook, during this la&s;t &s;entence, and ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them on the floor.</P>
<P>"If I feel gratitude towards you, my Lord." continued he, "gratitude is innate in my heart, and I mu&s;t al&s;o feel it towards her, who fir&s;t introduced me to your protection."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">Again the colour flew to Lord Elm|wood's face; and again he could hardly re&s;train him&s;elf from uttering his indigna|tion.</P>
<P>"It was the mother of Lady Ma|tilda;" continued Ru&s;hbrook, "who was this friend to me; nor will I ever think of marriage, or any other joyful pro&s;pect, while you abandon the only child of my beloved patrone&s;s, and load me with the rights, which belong to her."</P>
<P>Here Ru&s;hbrook &s;topped &mdash; and Lord Elmwood was &s;ilent too, for near half a minute; but &s;till his countenance con|tinued fixed, with his unvaried re&s;olves.</P>
<P>After this long pau&s;e, his Lord&s;hip &s;aid compo&s;ely, but firmly, "Have you fini&s;hed, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook?"</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">"All that I dare to utter, my Lord, and I fear, already too much."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook now trembled more than ever, and looked pale as death; for the ardour of &s;peaking being over, he waited his &s;entence, with le&s;s con&s;tancy of mind than he expected he &s;hould.</P>
<P>"You di&s;approve my conduct, it &s;eems;" &s;aid Lord Elmwood, "and in that, you are but like the re&s;t of the world&mdash;and yet, among all my acquaint|ance, you are the only one who has dared to in&s;ult me with your opinion.&mdash; And this you have not done inadvertent|ly; moreover knowingly, willingly, and deliberately.&mdash;But as it has been my fate to be u&s;ed ill, and &s;evered from all tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom my &s;oul has been mo&s;t attached; with le&s;s regret I can part from you, than was this my fir&s;t trial."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">There was a truth and a pathetic &s;ound in the utterance of the&s;e words that &s;truck Ru&s;hbrook to the heart&mdash;and he beheld him&s;elf as a barbarian, who had treated his benevolent and only friend, with an in&s;ufferable liberty; void of re&s;pect for tho&s;e gnawing &s;orrows which had imbiter|ed &s;o many years of his life, and in open violation of his mo&s;t &s;trict commands.&mdash; He felt he de&s;erved all he was going to &s;uffer, and he fell upon his knees, not &s;o much to deprecate the doom he &s;aw impending, as thus humbly to acknow|ledge it was his due.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood, iritated by this po&s;|ture, as a &s;ign of the pre&s;umptuous hopes he might be forgiven, &s;uffered now his anger to break through all bounds; and rai&s;ing his voice, he cried in rage,</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">"Leave my hou&s;e, Sir,&mdash;Leave my hou&s;e in&s;tantly, and &s;eek &s;ome other home."</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t as the&s;e words were begun, Sand|ford opened the library door; was wit|ne&s;s to them, and to the imploring &s;itua|tion of Ru&s;hbrook. &mdash; He &s;tood &s;ilent with amaze!</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook aro&s;e, and feeling in his mind a pre&s;age, that he might never from that hour, behold his benefactor more; as he bowed to him in token of obedience to his commands, a &s;hower of tears covered his face;&mdash;but Lord Elm|wood, unmoved, fixed his eyes upon him which pur&s;ued him with their en|raged looks to the end of the room. &mdash; Here he had to pa&s;s Sandford; who, for the fir&s;t time in his life, took hold of him by the hand, and &s;aid to Lord Elm|wood,
<PB N="40" REF="41">
"My Lord, what's the matter?"</P>
<P>"That, ungrateful villain," cried his Lord&s;hip, "has dared to in&s;ult me.&mdash; Leave my hou&s;e this moment, Sir."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook made an effort to go, but Sandford &s;till held his hand; and &s;aid to Lord Elmwood,</P>
<P>"He is but a boy, my Lord, and do not give him the puni&s;hment of a man."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook now &s;natched his hand from Sandford's, and threw it with him|&s;elf upon his neck; where he indeed &s;obbed like a boy.</P>
<P>"You are both in league." exclaimed Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>"Do you &s;u&s;pect me of partiality to Mr. Ru&s;hbrook?" &s;aid Sandford, ad|vancing nearer to his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">Ru&s;hbrook had now gained the point of remaining in the room; but the hope that privilege in&s;pired (while he &s;till harboured all the ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions for his fate) gave birth, perhaps, to a more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ation of pain, than de&s;pair would have done. &mdash; He &s;tood &s;ilent &mdash; confounded&mdash;hoping he was forgiven&mdash; fearing he was not.</P>
<P>As Sandford approached &s;till nearer to Lord Elmwood, he continued, "No, my Lord, I know you do not &s;u&s;pect me, of partiality to Mr. Ru&s;hbrook&mdash; has any part of my behaviour ever di&s;|covered it?"</P>
<P>"You now then," replied, his Lord|&s;hip, "only interfere to provoke me."</P>
<P>"If that were the ca&s;e," returned Sandford, "there have been occa&s;ions, when I might have done it more effec|tually&mdash;when my own heart-&s;trings were
<PB N="42" REF="43">
breaking, becau&s;e I would not provoke, or add to what you &s;uffered."</P>
<P>"I am obliged to you, Mr. Sand|ford." &s;aid his Lord&s;hip mildly.</P>
<P>"And if, my Lord, I have proved any merit in a late forbearance, reward me for it now; and take this young man from the depth of de&s;pair in which I &s;ee he is &s;unk, and &s;ay you pardon him."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood made no an&s;wer&mdash;and Ru&s;hbrook drawing &s;trong inferences of hope from his &s;ilence, lifted up his eyes from the ground, and ventured to look in his face; he found it compo&s;ed to what it had been, but &s;till &s;trongly marked with agitation. &mdash; He ca&s;t his eyes away again, in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>On which his Lord&s;hip &s;aid to him&mdash; "I &s;hall po&s;tpone your complying with my orders, till you think fit once more to
<PB N="43" REF="44">
provoke them &mdash; and then, not even Sandford, &s;hall dare to plead your ex|cu&s;e."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook bowed.</P>
<P>"Go, leave the room, Sir."</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly obeyed.</P>
<P>While Sandford, turning to Lord Elmwood, &s;hook him by the hand, and cried, "My Lord, I thank you&mdash;I thank you very kindly, my Lord&mdash;I &s;hall now begin to think I have &s;ome weight with you."</P>
<P>"You might indeed think &s;o, did you know how much I have pardoned."</P>
<P>"What was his offence, my Lord?"</P>
<P>"Such as I would not have forgiven you, or any earthly being be&s;ides him|&s;elf&mdash;but while you were &s;peaking in his behalf, I recollected there was a grati|tude &s;o extraordinary in the hazards he ran, that almo&s;t made him pardonable."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">"I gue&s;s the &s;ubject then," cried Sandford; "and yet I could not have &s;uppo&s;ed"&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is a &s;ubject we cannot &s;peak on, Sandford, therefore let us drop it."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words the di&s;cour&s;e conclu|ded.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>TO the great relief of Ru&s;hbrook, Lord Elmwood that day dined from home, and he had not the confu&s;ion to &s;ee him again till the evening.&mdash;Previous to this, Sandford and he met at dinner; but as the attendants were pre&s;ent, no|thing pa&s;&s;ed on either &s;ide re&s;pecting the incident in the morning.&mdash;Ru&s;h|brook, from the peril which had &s;o lately threatened him, was now in his perfect cool, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, &s;en&s;es; and notwith&s;tanding the real tenderne&s;s which he bore to the daughter of his benefactor, he was not in&s;en&s;ible to the comfort of finding him&s;elf, once more in
<PB N="46" REF="47">
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e enjoyments he had forfeited, and for a moment lo&s;t.</P>
<P>As he reflected on this, to Sandford he felt the fir&s;t tie of acknowledgement&mdash; but for his compa&s;&s;ion, he knew he &s;hould have been at that very time of their meeting at dinner, away from Elmwood Hou&s;e for ever &mdash; and bearing on his mind a &s;till more painful recollection; the burthen of his kind patron's con|tinual di&s;plea&s;ure. Filled with the&s;e thoughts, all the time of dinner he could &s;carce look at his companion without his eyes &s;wimming in tears of gratitude, and whenever he attempted to &s;peak to him, gratitude choaked his utterance.</P>
<P>Sandford on his part behaved ju&s;t the &s;ame as ever; and to &s;how he did not wi&s;h to remind Ru&s;hbrook of what he
<PB N="47" REF="48">
had done, he was ju&s;t as uncivil as ever.</P>
<P>Among other things, he &s;aid "He did not know Lord Elmwood dined from home, for if he had, he &s;hould have dined in his own apartment."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was &s;till more obliged to him for all this, and the weight of obli|gations with which he was oppre&s;&s;ed, made him long for an opportunity to re|lieve him&s;elf by expre&s;&s;ions. &mdash; As &s;oon, therefore, as the &s;ervants were all with|drawn, he began:</P>
<P>"Mr. Sandford, whatever has been your opinion of <HI>me,</HI> I take pride to my|&s;elf, that in my &s;entiments towards <HI>you,</HI> I have always di&s;tingui&s;hed you for that humane and di&s;intere&s;ted character, you have this day proved."</P>
<P>"Humane, and di&s;intere&s;ted," re|plied Sandford, "are two flattering epi|thets
<PB N="48" REF="49">
for an old man going out of the world, and who can have no temptation to be otherwi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then &s;uffer me to call your actions generous and compa&s;&s;ionate, for they have &s;aved me"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I know, young man," cried Sand|ford interrupting him, "you are glad at what I have done, and that you find a gratification in telling me you are; but it is a gratification I will not indulge you with&mdash;therefore &s;ay another &s;entence on the &s;ubject, and" (he ro&s;e from his &s;eat) "I'll leave the room, and never come into your company again, whatever your uncle may &s;ay to it."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook &s;aw by the &s;olemnity of his countenance he was &s;erious, and po&s;i|tively a&s;&s;ured him he would never thank him more; on which Sandford took his &s;eat again, but he &s;till frowned, and it
<PB N="49" REF="50">
was many minutes before he conquered his ill humour. &mdash; As his countenance became le&s;s &s;our, Ru&s;hbrook fell from &s;ome general topics he had eagerly &s;tarted in order to appea&s;e him, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"How hard is it to re&s;train conver&s;a|tion from the &s;ubject of our thoughts; and yet amid&s;t our deare&s;t friends, and among per&s;ons who have the &s;ame di&s;|po&s;itions and &s;entiments as our own, their minds fixed upon the &s;elf-&s;ame objects, is this con&s;traint practi&s;ed&mdash;and thus &s;ociety, which was meant for one of our greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, becomes in&s;ipid, nay oftentimes more weari&s;ome than &s;o|litude."</P>
<P>"I think, young man," replied Sand|ford, "you have made pretty free with your &s;peech to-day, and ought not to complain of the want of toleration on that &s;core."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">"I do complain," replied Ru&s;hbrook; "for if toleration was more frequent, the favour of obtaining it would be le&s;s."</P>
<P>"And your pride, I &s;uppo&s;e, is above receiving a favour."</P>
<P>"Never from tho&s;e I e&s;teem; and to convince you of it, I wi&s;h this moment to reque&s;t a favour of you."</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay I &s;hall refu&s;e it.&mdash;How|ever&mdash;what is it?"</P>
<P>"Permit me to &s;peak to you upon the &s;ubject of Lady Matilda?"</P>
<P>Sandford made no an&s;wer, con&s;equent|ly did not forbid him &mdash; and he pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>"For her &s;ake &mdash; as I &s;uppo&s;e Lord Elmwood may have told you &mdash; I this morning ra&s;hly threw my&s;elf into the pre|dicament from whence you relea&s;ed me &mdash;for her &s;ake, I have &s;uffered much &mdash;
<PB N="51" REF="52">
for her &s;ake, I have hazarded a great deal, and am &s;till ready to hazard more."</P>
<P>"But for your own &s;ake, do not." re|turned Sandford drily.</P>
<P>"You may laugh at the&s;e &s;entiments as romantic, Mr. Sandford, but if they are, to me they are neverthele&s;s natural."</P>
<P>"But what &s;ervice are they to be, either to her, or to your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"They are painful to me, and to her would he but impertinent, were &s;he to know them."</P>
<P>"I &s;han't inform her of them, &s;o do not trouble your&s;elf to caution me again&s;t it."</P>
<P>"I was not going &mdash; you know I was not&mdash;but I was going to &s;ay, that from no one &s;o well as from you, could &s;he be told my &s;entiments, without the danger of her re&s;enting the liberty."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">"And what impre&s;&s;ion do you wi&s;h to give her, from her becoming ac|quainted with them?"</P>
<P>"The impre&s;&s;ion, that &s;he has one &s;incere friend &mdash; that upon every occur|rence in life, there is a heart &s;o devoted to all &s;he feels, &s;he can never &s;uffer with|out the &s;ympathy of another &mdash; or ever can command him, and all his fortunes to unite for her welfare, without his ready and immediate compliance."</P>
<P>"And do you imagine, that any of your profe&s;&s;ions, or any of her nece&s;&s;i|ties, would ever prevail upon her to put you to the trial?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps not."</P>
<P>"What, then, are the motives which induce you to wi&s;h her to be told of this?"</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook pau&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">"Do you think," continued Sand|ford, "the intelligence will give her any &s;atisfaction?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps not."</P>
<P>"Will it be of any to your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"The highe&s;t in the world."</P>
<P>"And &s;o all you have been urging upon this occa&s;ion, is, at la&s;t, only to plea&s;e your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"You wrong my meaning&mdash;it is &s;he &mdash;her merit which in&s;pires my de&s;ire of being known to her&mdash;it is her &s;ufferings, her innocence, her beauty"&mdash;</P>
<P>Sandford &s;tared&mdash;Ru&s;hbrook proceed|ed: "It is her"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Nay &s;top where you are," cried Sandford; "you are arrived at the ze|nith of perfection in a woman, and to add one qualification more, would be an anti-climax."</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">"Oh!" cried Ru&s;hbrook with warmth, "I loved her, before I ever beheld her."</P>
<P>"Loved her!" cried Sandford, with a&s;toni&s;hment, "You are talking of what you do not intend."</P>
<P>"I am, indeed," returned he in con|fu&s;ion, "I fell by accident on the word love."</P>
<P>"And by the &s;ame accident, &s;tum|bled on the word beauty; and thus by accident, am I come to the truth of all your profe&s;&s;ions."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook knew he loved; and though his affection had &s;prung from the mo&s;t laudable motives, yet was he a&s;hamed of it, as of a vice&mdash;he ro&s;e, walked about the room, and did not look Sandford in the face for a quarter of an hour.&mdash;Sand|ford &s;atisfied he had judged rightly, and
<PB N="55" REF="56">
yet unwilling to be too hard upon a pa&s;|&s;ion, which he readily believed mu&s;t have had many noble virtues for its founda|tion, now got up and walked away, without &s;aying any thing in cen&s;ure, though not a word in its approbation.</P>
<P>It was in the month of October, and ju&s;t dark, at the time Ru&s;hbrook was left alone, yet from the agitation of his mind, ari&s;ing from the &s;ubject on which he had been talking, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to remain in the hou&s;e, and therefore walk|ed into the fields; &mdash; but there was an|other in&s;tigation, more powerful than the nece&s;&s;ity of walking; it was the al|lurement of pa&s;&s;ing along that path where he had la&s;t &s;een Lady Matilda, and where, for the only time &s;he had conde|&s;cended to &s;peak to him dive&s;ted of
<PB N="56" REF="57">
haughtine&s;s, and with a gentlene&s;s that dwelt upon his memory beyond her all other endowments.</P>
<P>Here he retraced his own &s;teps repeat|edly, his whole imagination engro&s;&s;ed with her idea, till the &s;ound of her fa|ther's chariot returning home from his vi&s;it, rou&s;ed him from the &s;oft delu&s;ion of his trance, to dread the confu&s;ion and embarra&s;&s;ment he &s;hould endure, on the next meeting with his Lord&s;hip. He hoped Sandford might be pre&s;ent, and yet he was now, almo&s;t as much a&s;hamed to behold him as his uncle, whom he had &s;o lately offended.</P>
<P>As loath to leave the &s;pot where he was, as to enter the hou&s;e, he remained there till he con&s;idered it would be ill manners in his pre&s;ent humiliated &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
not to &s;how him&s;elf at the u&s;ual &s;upper hour, which was immediately.</P>
<P>As he laid his hand upon the door of the apartment to open it, he was &s;orry to hear by Lord Elmwood's voice, he was in the room before him; for there was &s;omething much more con&s;pecious and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, in entering where he al|ready was, than had his Lord&s;hip come in after him.&mdash;He found him&s;elf, how|ever rea&s;&s;ured, by overhearing his uncle laugh and &s;peak in a tone expre&s;&s;ive of the utmo&s;t good humour to Sandford, who was with him.</P>
<P>Yet again, he felt all the awkward|ne&s;s of his own &s;ituation; but mak|ing one courageous effort, opened the door and entered. &mdash; His Lord&s;hip had been away half the day, had dined abroad,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
and it was nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome notice of his return; Ru&s;hbrook therefore bow|ed humbly, and what was more to his advantage, he looked humbly. &mdash; Lord Elmwood made a &s;light return to the &s;alutation, but continued the recital he had begun to Sandford;&mdash;then &s;at down to the &s;upper table&mdash;&s;upped&mdash;and pa&s;&s;ed the whole evening without &s;aying a &s;yl|lable, or even ca&s;ting a look in remem|brance of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the morn|ing. &mdash; Or if there was any token, that &s;hewed he remembered the circum&s;tance at all, it was the putting his gla&s;s to his nephew's when Ru&s;hbrook called for wine, and drinking at the time he did.</P>

<P>Having taken this re&s;olution, he laid the plan of an open violation of all right, all power, and to bear away that prize by force, which no art was likely to procure.&mdash;He concerted with two of his favourite companions, but their advice was, "one &s;truggle more of fair means."
<PB N="60" REF="61">
This was totally again&s;t his Lord&s;hip's will, for he had much rather have en|countered the piercing cries of a female in the la&s;t agonies of di&s;tre&s;s, than the fatigue of her &s;entimental harangues, or elegant reproofs, &s;uch as he had the &s;en&s;e to under&s;tand, but not the capacity to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Stimulated, however, by his friends to one more trial; in &s;pite of the formal di&s;mi&s;&s;ion he had twice received, he in|truded another vi&s;it on Lady Matilda at the farm.&mdash;Provoked beyond bearing at &s;uch unfeeling a&s;&s;urance, Matilda refu&s;ed to come into the room where he was, and Mi&s;s Woodley alone received him, and expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at the little atten|tion he had paid to her explicit de&s;ire.</P>
<P>"Madam," replied the nobleman, "to be plain with you, I am in love."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">"I do not the lea&s;t doubt it, my Lord," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "nor ought you to doubt the truth of what I ad|vance, when I a&s;&s;ure you, you have not the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to hope your love will be returned; for Lady Matilda is re&s;olved <HI>never</HI> to li&s;ten to your pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"That man," he replied, "is to blame, who can relinqui&s;h his hopes, upon the mere re&s;olution of a lady."</P>
<P>"And that Lady would be wrong," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "who &s;hould entru&s;t her happine&s;s in the care of a man, who can think thus meanly of her, and of her &s;ex."</P>
<P>"I think highly of them all," return|ed his Lord&s;hip; "and to convince you in how high an e&s;timation I hold her Lady&s;hip in particular, my whole fortune is at her command."</P>

<P><PB N="62" REF="65">"Your ab&s;enting your&s;elf from this hou&s;e, Lord Margrave, &s;he would con|&s;ider as a much greater mark of your re&s;pect."</P>
<P>A long conver&s;ation, equally uninte|re&s;ting as this, en&s;ued; till the unex|pected arrival of Mr. Sandford put an end to it. &mdash; He &s;tarted at the &s;ight of Lord Margrave; but his Lord&s;hip was much more affected at the &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>"My Lord," &s;aid Sandford boldly to him, "have you received any en|couragement from Lady Matilda, to authori&s;e this vi&s;it?"</P>
<P>"None, upon my honour, Mr. Sand|ford; but I hope you know how to par|don a lover?"</P>
<P>"A rational one I do&mdash;but you, my Lord, are not &s;uch, while you per&s;ecute the pretended object of your affection."</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66">"Do you call it per&s;ecution that I once offered her a &s;hare of my title and fortune &mdash; and even now, declare my fortune is at her di&s;po&s;al?"</P>
<P>Sandford was uncertain whether he under&s;tood his meaning &mdash; but his Lord|&s;hip, provoked at his ill reception, felt a triumph in not detaining him long in doubt, and proceeded thus:</P>
<P>"For the di&s;carded daughter of Lord Elmwood, cannot expect the &s;ame pro|po&s;als which I made while &s;he was ac|knowledged, and under the protection of her father."</P>
<P>"What propo&s;als then, my Lord?" a&s;ked Sandford ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"Such," replied his Lord&s;hip, "as the Duke of Avon made to her mother."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley quitted the room that in&s;tant.&mdash;But Sandford, who never
<PB N="64" REF="67">
felt re&s;entment but to tho&s;e in whom he &s;aw &s;ome virtue, calmly replied,</P>
<P>"My Lord, the Duke of Avon was a gentleman, a man of elegance and breeding; and what have you to offer in recompence for your defects in the&s;e?"</P>
<P>"My wealth," replied he, "oppo&s;ed to her indigence."</P>
<P>Sandford &s;miled, and an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"Do you &s;uppo&s;e that wealth can be e&s;teemed, which has not been able to make you re&s;pectable?&mdash;What is it which makes wealth valuable? Is it the plea|&s;ures of the table? the plea&s;ures of liv|ing in a fine hou&s;e? or riding in a fine coach? The&s;e are plea&s;ures a Lord en|joys, but in common with his valet.&mdash; It is the plea&s;ure of being con&s;picuous, which makes riches de&s;irable &mdash; but if we are con&s;picuous only for our vice and
<PB N="65" REF="68">
folly, had we not better remain in po|verty?"</P>
<P>"You are beneath my notice."</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t I &s;hall continue &s;o&mdash;and that your Lord&s;hip will never again conde&s;cend to come where I am."</P>
<P>"A man of rank conde&s;cends to mix with any &s;ociety, when a pretty woman is his object."</P>
<P>"My Lord, I have a book here in my pocket, which I am eager to read; it is an author who &s;peaks &s;en&s;e and rea|&s;on &mdash; will you pardon the impatience I feel for &s;uch company; and permit me to call your carriage?"</P>
<P>Saying this he went ha&s;tily and called to his Lord&s;hip's &s;ervants; the carriage drove up, the door was opened, and Lord Margrave, a&s;hamed to be expo&s;ed before his attendants, or convinced of
<PB N="66" REF="69">
the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of remaining any longer where he was, departed.</P>
<P>Sandford was &s;oon joined by the ladies; and the conver&s;ation falling, of cour&s;e, upon the nobleman who had ju&s;t taken his leave, Sandford unwarily exclaimed, "I wi&s;h Ru&s;hbrook had been here."</P>
<P>"Who?" cried Lady Matilda.</P>
<P>"I do believe," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "that young man has &s;ome good qua|lities."</P>
<P>"A great many." returned Sandford, mutteringly.</P>
<P>"Happy young man!" cried Ma|tilda: "he is beloved by all tho&s;e, who&s;e affection it would be my choice to po&s;|&s;e&s;s, beyond any other ble&s;&s;ing this world could be&s;tow."</P>
<P>"And yet I que&s;tion, if Ru&s;hbrook is a happy man." &s;aid Sandford.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">"He cannot be otherwi&s;e," returned Matilda, "if he is a man of under&s;tand|ing."</P>
<P>"He does not want for that," replied Sandford; "although he has certainly many indi&s;cretions."</P>
<P>"But which Lord Elmwood, I &s;up|po&s;e," &s;aid Matilda, "looks upon with tenderne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Not upon all his faults," an&s;wered Sandford; "for I have &s;een him in very dangerous circum&s;tances with your father."</P>
<P>"Have you indeed?" cried Matilda: "then I pity him."</P>
<P>"And I believe," &s;aid Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "that from his heart, he compa&s;|&s;ionates you. &mdash; Now, Mr. Sandford," continued &s;he, "though this is the fir&s;t time I ever heard you &s;peak in his fa|vour, (and I once thought as indiffe|rently
<PB N="68" REF="71">
of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook as you can do) yet now I will venture to a&s;k you, whe|ther you do not think he wi&s;hes Lady Matilda much happier than &s;he is?"</P>
<P>"I have heard him &s;ay &s;o." an&s;wered Sandford.</P>
<P>"It is a &s;ubject," returned Lady Matilda, "which I did not imagine you, Mr. Sandford, would have permitted to have been lightly mentioned, in your pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>"Lightly! &mdash; Do you &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, we turned your &s;ituation into ridi|cule?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir, &mdash; but there is a &s;ort of humiliation in the grief to which I am doomed, that ought &s;urely to be treated with the highe&s;t degree of delicacy by my friends."</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="72">"I don't know on what point you &s;ix real delicacy; but if it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;orrow, the young man gives a proof he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, for he &s;hed tears when I la&s;t heard him mention your name."</P>
<P>"I have more cau&s;e to weep at the mention of his."</P>
<P>"Perhaps &s;o &mdash; But let me tell you, Lady Matilda, your father might have preferred a more unworthy object."</P>
<P>"Still had he been to me," &s;he cried, "an object of envy.&mdash;And as I frankly confe&s;s my envy of Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, I hope you will pardon my malice, which is, you know, but a con&s;equent crime."</P>
<P>The &s;ubject now turned again upon Lord Margrave; and all of them being firmly per&s;uaded, this la&s;t reception would put an end to every farther intru|&s;ion
<PB N="70" REF="73">
from his Lord&s;hip, they treated his preten&s;ions, and he him&s;elf, with the contempt they in&s;pired &mdash; but not with the caution they de&s;erved.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning early Mr. Sand|ford returned to Elmwood Hou&s;e, but with his &s;pirits depre&s;&s;ed, and his heart overcharged with &s;orrow. &mdash; He had &s;een Lady Matilda, the object of his vi&s;it, but he had beheld her con&s;iderably altered in her looks and in her health;&mdash;&s;he was become very thin, and in&s;tead of the mo&s;t beautiful bloom that u&s;ed to &s;pread her cheeks, her whole complexion was of a deadly pale &mdash; her countenance no longer expre&s;&s;ed hope or fear, but a fix|ed melancholy &mdash; &s;he &s;hed no tears, but was all &s;adne&s;s. &mdash; He had beheld this, and he had heard her in&s;ulted by the li|centious propo&s;als of a nobleman, from
<PB N="72" REF="75">
whom there was no &s;atisfaction to be de|manded, becau&s;e &s;he had no friend to vindicate her honour.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, who &s;u&s;pected where Sand|ford was gone, and imagined he would return that day, took his forenoon's ride, &s;o as to meet him on the road a few miles di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle; for &s;ince his pe|rilous &s;ituation with Lord Elmwood, he was &s;o fully convinced of the general phi|lanthropy of Sandford's character, that in &s;pite of his churli&s;h manners, he now ad|dre&s;&s;ed him, free from that re&s;erve to which his rough behavour had formerly given birth.&mdash;And Sandford on his part, believing he had formed an illiberal opi|nion of Lord Elmwood's heir (though he took no pains to let him know that opi|nion was changed) yet re&s;olved to make him re&s;titution upon every occa&s;ion that offered.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="76">Their mutual greetings when they met, were unceremonious but cordial; and Ru&s;hbrook turned his hor&s;e and rode back with Sandford; &mdash; yet, inti|midated by his re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s for Lady Matilda, rather than by fear of the rebuffs of his companion, he had not the courage to name her, till their ride was ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and they came within a few yards of the hou&s;e&mdash;incited then by the apprehen&s;ion he might not &s;oon again enjoy &s;o fit an opportunity, he &s;aid.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Mr. Sandford, if I gue&s;s where you have been, and if my curio&s;ity forces me to enquire for Mi&s;s Woodley's and Lady Matilda's health?"</P>
<P>He named Mi&s;s Woodley fir&s;t, to prolong the time before he mentioned Matilda, for though to name her gave him extreme plea&s;ure, yet it was a plea|&s;ure
<PB N="74" REF="77">
intermingled with confu&s;ion and pain.</P>
<P>"They are both very well," replied Sandford, "at lea&s;t they did not com|plain they were &s;ick."</P>
<P>"They are not in &s;pirits, I &s;uppo&s;e?" &s;aid Ru&s;hbrook.</P>
<P>"No, indeed." replied Sandford, &s;haking his head.</P>
<P>"No new misfortune has happened, I hope?" cried Ru&s;hbrook, for it was plain to &s;ee Sandford's &s;pirits were unu&s;u|ally ca&s;t down.</P>
<P>"Nothing new," returned he, "ex|cept the in&s;olence of a young noble|man."</P>
<P>"What nobleman?" cried Ru&s;h|brook.</P>
<P>"A lover of Lady Matilda's." replied Sandford.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78">Ru&s;hbrook was petrified. &mdash; "Who? What lover, Mr. Sandford?&mdash;explain?"</P>
<P>They were now arrived at the hou&s;e; and Sandford, without making any re|ply to this que&s;tion, &s;aid to the &s;er|vant who took his hor&s;e, "She has come a long way this morning; take care of her."</P>
<P>This interruption was torture to Ru&s;h|brook, who kept clo&s;e to his &s;ide, in order to obtain a farther explanation; but Sandford without attending to him, walk|ed negligently into the hall, and before they advanced many &s;teps they were met by Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P>All farther information was for the pre&s;ent, now wholly put an end to.</P>
<P>"How do you do, Sandford?" &s;aid his Lord&s;hip with extreme kindne&s;s; as if he thanked him for the journey which he &s;u&s;pected he had been taking.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">"I am indifferent well, my Lord." replied he, with a face of deep concern, and a tear in his eye, partly in gratitude for his Lord&s;hip's civility, and partly in reproach for his cruelty.</P>
<P>It was not now till the evening, that Ru&s;hbrook had an opportunity of renew|ing the conver&s;ation, which had been &s;o barbarou&s;ly interrupted.</P>
<P>In the evening, no longer able to &s;up|port the &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which he was; with|out fear or &s;hame he followed Sandford to his chamber at the time of his retiring, and entreated of him, with all the anxiety he &s;uffered, to reveal to him what he al|luded to, when he made mention of a lover, and in&s;olence to Lady Matilda.</P>
<P>Sandford &s;eeing his emotion, was an|gry he had inadvertently mentioned the &s;ubject; and putting on an air of &s;urly
<PB N="77" REF="80">
importance, de&s;ired if he had any bu&s;i|ne&s;s with him, to call in the morning.</P>
<P>Exa&s;perated at &s;o unexpected a re|ception, and at the pain of his di&s;appoint|ment, Ru&s;hbrook replied, "He treated him cruelly, nor would he &s;tir out of his room, till he had recived a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to his que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"Then bring your bed," replied Sandford, "for you mu&s;t pa&s;s your whole night here."</P>
<P>He found it vain to think of obtaining any intelligence by threats, he therefore &s;aid in a timid per&s;ua&s;ive manner,</P>
<P>"Did you, Mr. Sandford, hear Lady Matilda mention my name?"</P>
<P>"Yes." replied Sandford, a little bet|ter reconciled to him.</P>
<P>"Did you tell her what I declared to you?" he a&s;ked with more diffidence &s;till.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81">"No." replied Sandford.</P>
<P>"It is very well, Sir." returned he vexed to the heart.&mdash;yet again wi&s;hing to &s;ooth him.</P>
<P>"You certainly, Mr. Sandford, know what is for the be&s;t &mdash; yet I entreat you will give me &s;ome farther account of the nobleman you named?"</P>
<P>"I know what is for the be&s;t," re|plied Sandford, "and I won't."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook bowed, and immediately left the room.&mdash;He went apparently &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive, but the moment he &s;howed this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he took the re&s;olution of paying a vi&s;it him&s;elf to the farm where Lady Matilda re&s;ided; and of learning either from Mi&s;s Woodley, the people of the hou&s;e, the neighbours, or perhaps from Lady Matilda's own lips, the &s;ecret which the ob&s;tinacy of Sandford had de|nied him.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82">He &s;aw all the dangers of this under|taking, but none appeared &s;o great as the danger of lo&s;ing her he loved, by the influence of a rival &mdash; and though Sandford had named "in&s;olence," he was in doubt whether what had appeared &s;uch to him, was &s;uch in reality, or would be con&s;idered as &s;uch by her.</P>
<P>To prevent his ab&s;ence being &s;u&s;pect|ed by Lord Elmwood, he immediately called his groom, ordered his hor&s;e, and giving tho&s;e &s;ervants concerned, a &s;trict charge of &s;ecre&s;y, and &s;ome frivolous pretence to apologize for his not being pre&s;ent at breakfa&s;t (re&s;olving to be back by dinner) he &s;et off that night, and arrived at an inn about a mile from the farm at break of day.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="83">The joy he felt when he found him&s;elf &s;o near to the beloved object of his jour|ney, made him thank Sandford in his heart, for the unkindne&s;s which had &s;ent him thither. &mdash; But new difficulties aro&s;e, how to accompli&s;h the end for which he came;&mdash;he learnt from the people of the inn that a Lord with a fine equipage had vi&s;ited at the farm, but who he was, or for what purpo&s;e he went, no one could inform him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable to return with the &s;ame doubts un&s;atisfied with which he &s;et out, and yet afraid to proceed to extremities that might be con&s;trued into pre&s;ump|tion, he walked di&s;con&s;olately (almo&s;t di&s;tractedly) about the fields, looking repeatedly at his watch, and wi&s;hing the time to &s;tand &s;till, till he was ready to go back with his errand compleated.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="84">Every field he pa&s;&s;ed, brought him nearer to the hou&s;e on which his imagi|nation was fixed; but how, without for|feiting every appearance of that very re|&s;pect he &s;o powerfully felt, could he at|tempt to enter it?&mdash;he &s;aw the indeco|rum, re&s;olved not to be guilty of it, and yet walked on till he was within but a &s;hort orchard of the door. Could he then retreat?&mdash;he wi&s;hed he could; but he now found he had proceeded too far, to be any longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. &mdash; The time was urgent; he mu&s;t either be bold, and venture her di&s;plea&s;ure; or by diffidence during one moment, give up all his hopes perhaps for ever.</P>
<P>With that &s;ame di&s;regard to con|&s;equences, which actuated him when he dared to &s;upplicate Lord Elmwood
<PB N="82" REF="85">
in his daughter's behalf, he at length went eagerly to the door and rapped.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant came&mdash;he a&s;ked to "&s;peak with Mi&s;s Woodley, if &s;he was quite alone."</P>
<P>He was &s;hown into an apartment, and Mi&s;s Woodley entered to him.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted when &s;he beheld who it was; but as he did not &s;ee a frown upon her face, he caught hold of her hand, and &s;aid per&s;ua&s;ively,</P>
<P>"Do not be offended with me.&mdash;If I mean to offend you, may I forfeit my life in atonement."</P>
<P>Poor Mi&s;s Woodley, glad in her &s;oli|tude to &s;ee any one from Elmwood Hou&s;e, forgot his vi&s;it was an offence till he put her in mind of it; &s;he then &s;aid with &s;ome re&s;erve,</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">"Tell me the purport of your coming, Sir, and perhaps I may then have no cau&s;e to complain?"</P>
<P>"It was to &s;ee Lady Matilda," he replied, "or to hear of her health.&mdash;It was to offer her my &s;ervices&mdash;it was Mi&s;s Woodley, to convince her, if po&s;&s;ible, of my e&s;teem."</P>
<P>"Had you no other method, Sir?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley with the &s;ame re|&s;erve.</P>
<P>"None;" replied he, "or with joy I &s;hould have embraced it; and if you can inform me of any other, tell me I be&s;eech you in&s;tantly, and I will imme|diately begone, and pur&s;ue your direc|tions."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"You know of no other means, Mi&s;s Woodley." he cried.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="87">"And yet I cannot commend this." &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Nor do I.&mdash;Do not imagine becau&s;e you &s;ee me here, I approve my conduct; but reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity, pity the motives that have urged it."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley did pity them; but as &s;he would not own &s;he did, &s;he could think of nothing el&s;e to &s;ay.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a bell rung from the chamber above.</P>
<P>"That is Lady Matilda's bell," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley; "&s;he is coming to take a &s;hort walk.&mdash;Do you wi&s;h to &s;ee her?"</P>
<P>Though it was the fir&s;t wi&s;h Ru&s;h|brook had, he pau&s;ed, and &s;aid, "Will you plead my excu&s;e?"</P>
<P>As the flight of &s;tairs was but &s;hort, which Matilda had to come down, &s;he
<PB N="85" REF="88">
was in the room with Mi&s;s Woodley and Mr. Ru&s;hbrook ju&s;t as that &s;entence ended.</P>
<P>She had &s;tept beyond the door of the apartment, when perceiving a vi&s;iter, &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, animated, though trem|bling at her pre&s;ence, cried, "Lady Matilda, do not avoid me, till you know I de&s;erve &s;uch a puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>She immediately &s;aw who it was, and returned back with a proper pride, and yet a proper politene&s;s in her man|ner.</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "I did not know you, and I was afraid I intruded upon Mi&s;s Woodley and a &s;tranger."</P>
<P>"You do not then con&s;ider me as a &s;tranger, Lady Matilda? and that you do
<PB N="86" REF="89">
not, requires my warme&s;t acknowledge|ments."</P>
<P>She &s;at down, as if overcome by ill &s;pirits and ill health.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley now a&s;ked Ru&s;hbrook to &s;it&mdash;for till now &s;he had not.</P>
<P>"No, Madam," replied he, with con|fu&s;ion, "not unle&s;s her Lady&s;hip gives me permi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Lady Matilda &s;miled, and pointed to a chair &mdash; and all the kindne&s;s which Ru&s;hbrook during his whole life had received from Lord Elmwood, never in&s;pired half the gratitude, which this &s;ingle in&s;tance of civility from his daugh|ter excited.</P>
<P>He &s;at down with the confe&s;&s;ion of the obligation, upon every feature of his face.</P>
<P>"I am not well, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;aid Matilda, languidly; "and you
<PB N="87" REF="90">
mu&s;t excu&s;e any want of etiquette, you meet with at this hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"While you excu&s;e me, Madam, what can I have to complain of?"</P>
<P>She appeared ab&s;ent while he was &s;peaking, and turning to Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;aid, "Do you think I had better walk to-day?"</P>
<P>"No, my dear," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley; "the ground is damp, and the air cold."</P>
<P>"You are not well, indeed, Lady Matilda," &s;aid Ru&s;hbrook, gazing upon her with the mo&s;t tender re&s;pect.</P>
<P>She &s;hook her head; and the tears, without any effort either to impel or re&s;train them, run fa&s;t down her face.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and with an accent and manner the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ive, &s;aid, "We are cou&s;ins, Lady Matilda&mdash;in our infancy we were brought
<PB N="88" REF="91">
up together&mdash;we were beloved by the &s;ame mother &mdash; fo&s;tered by the &s;ame fa|ther"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh!" cried &s;he, interrupting him, and the tears now gu&s;hed in torrents.</P>
<P>"Nay, do not let me add to your unea&s;ine&s;s," re&s;umed he, "while I am attempting to alleviate it.&mdash;In&s;truct me what I am to do to &s;how my e&s;teem and re&s;pect, rather than permit me thus un|guided, to ru&s;h upon what you may mi&s;term, cruelty or arrogance."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley went to Matilda, took her hand, then wiped the tears from her eyes, while Matilda reclined again&s;t her, wholly regardle&s;s of Ru&s;hbrook's pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>"If I have been the lea&s;t in&s;trumen|tal to this &s;orrow,"&mdash;&s;aid Ru&s;hbrook, with a face as much agitated as his mind.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="92">"No," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley in a low voice, "you have not &mdash; &s;he is often thus."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Matilda, rai&s;ing her head, "I am frequently &s;o weak I can|not re&s;i&s;t the &s;malle&s;t incitement to grief. &mdash;But do not make your vi&s;it long, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," &s;he continued, "for I was ju&s;t then thinking, that &s;hould Lord Elmwood hear of this attention you have paid me, it might be fatal to you." &mdash; Here &s;he wept again, as bitterly as before.</P>
<P>"There is no probability of his hear|ing of it, Madam," Ru&s;hbrook replied; "or if there was, I am per&s;uaded he would not re&s;ent it; for ye&s;terday, when I am confident he knew Mr. Sandford had been to &s;ee you, he received him on his return with unu&s;ual marks of kindne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93">"Did he?" &s;aid &s;he &mdash; and again &s;he lifted up her head; and her eyes for a moment beamed with hope and joy.</P>
<P>"There is &s;omething which we can|not yet define," &s;aid Ru&s;hbrook, "that Lord Elmwood &s;truggles with; but when time &s;hall have eradicated"&mdash;</P>
<P>Before he could proceed farther, Ma|tilda was once more &s;unk into de&s;pon|dency, and &s;carce attended to what he was &s;aying.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley ob&s;erving this, &s;aid, "Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, let it be a token we &s;hall be glad to &s;ee you hereafter, that I now u&s;e the freedom to beg you will put an end to your vi&s;it."</P>
<P>"You &s;end me away, Madam," re|turned he, "with the warme&s;t thanks for the reception you have given me; and this la&s;t a&s;&s;urance of your kindne&s;s is beyond any other favour you could
<PB N="91" REF="94">
have be&s;towed.&mdash;Lady Matilda," added he, "&s;uffer me to take your hand at parting, and let it be a te&s;timony that you acknowledge me for a relation."</P>
<P>She put out her hand&mdash;which he knelt to receive, but did not rai&s;e it to his lips&mdash;he held the boon too &s;acred&mdash;and only looking earne&s;tly upon it, as it lay pale and wan in his, he breathed a &s;igh over it, and withdrew.</P>

<P>SORROWFUL and affecting as this interview had been, Ru&s;hbrook as he rode home reflected upon it with the mo&s;t inordinate delight; and had he not beheld decline of health, in all the looks and behaviour of Lady Matilda, his felicity had been unbounded.&mdash;En|tranced in the happine&s;s of her &s;ociety, the thought of his rival never came once to his mind while he was with her; a want of recollection, however, he by no means regretted, as her whole ap|pearance contradicted every &s;u&s;picion he could po&s;&s;ibly entertain, of her favour|ing the addre&s;&s;es of any man living &mdash;
<PB N="93" REF="96">
and had he remembered, he had not dared to have named the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The time run &s;o &s;wiftly while he was away, that it was beyond the dinner hour at Elmwood Hou&s;e, when he re|turned. &mdash; Heated, his dre&s;s, and his hair di&s;ordered, he entered the dining room ju&s;t as the de&s;ert was put upon the table.&mdash;He was confounded at his own appearance, and at the fal&s;ehoods he &s;hould be obliged to fabricate in his ex|cu&s;e; there was yet that which en|gaged his attention, beyond any cir|cum&s;tance relating to him&s;elf &mdash; the fea|tures of Lord Elmwood &mdash; of which his daughter's, whom he had ju&s;t beheld, had the mo&s;t &s;triking re&s;emblance; while hers were &s;oftened by &s;orrow, as his Lord&s;hip's were rendered au&s;tere by the &s;elf-&s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">"Where have you been?" &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, with a frown.</P>
<P>"A cha&s;e, my Lord &mdash; I beg your pardon &mdash; but a pack of dogs I unex|pectedly met."&mdash; For in the hacknied art of lying without injury to any one, Ru&s;hbrook, to his &s;hame, was profi|cient.</P>
<P>His excu&s;es were received, and the &s;ubject cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>During his ab&s;ence that day, Lord Elmwood had called Sandford apart and &s;aid to him,&mdash;that as the malevolence which he once ob&s;erved between him and Ru&s;hbrook had, he perceived, &s;ub|&s;ided; he advi&s;ed him, if he was a well-wi&s;her to the young man, to &s; ound his heart, and coun&s;el him not to act contrary to the will of his neare&s;t rela|tion and friend. &mdash; "I my&s;elf am
<PB N="95" REF="98">
too ha&s;ty," continued Lord Elmwood, "and, unhappily, too much determined upon what I have once (though, per|haps, ra&s;hly) &s;aid, to &s;peak upon a topic where it is probable I &s;hall meet with oppo&s;ition. &mdash; You, Sandford, can rea&s;on with moderation. &mdash; For after all I have done for my nephew, it would be a pity to for&s;ake him at la&s;t; and yet, that is but too likely, if he provokes me."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Sandford, "I will &s;peak to him."</P>
<P>"Yet," cried his Lord&s;hip &s;ternly, "do not urge what you &s;ay for my &s;ake, but for his &mdash; I can part from him with ea&s;e&mdash;but he may then repent, and, you know, repentance always comes too late with me."</P>
<P>"My Lord, I will u&s;e my endea|vours for his welfare.&mdash;But what is the
<PB N="96" REF="99">
&s;ubject on which he has refu&s;ed to com|ply with your de&s;ires?"</P>
<P>"Matrimony&mdash;have not I told you?"</P>
<P>"Not a word."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h him to marry, that I may then conclude the deeds in re&s;pect to my e&s;tate &mdash; And the only child of Sir William Winterton (a rich heire&s;s) was the wife I meant to propo&s;e; but from his indifference to all I have &s;aid on the &s;ubject, I have not yet mentioned her name to him; you may."</P>
<P>"I will, my Lord, and u&s;e all my per&s;ua&s;ion towards his obedience; and you &s;hall have, at lea&s;t, a faithful ac|count of what he &s;ays."</P>
<P>Sandford the next morning &s;ought an opportunity of being alone with Ru&s;h|brook&mdash;he then plainly repeated to him what Lord Elmwood had &s;aid, and &s;aw
<PB N="97" REF="100">
him li&s;ten to it all, and an&s;wer with the mo&s;t tranquil re&s;olution, "He would do any thing to pre&s;erve the friend&s;hip and patronage of his uncle, but marry."</P>
<P>"What can be your rea&s;on?" a&s;ked Sandford&mdash;though he gue&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"A rea&s;on I cannot give to Lord Elmwood."</P>
<P>"Then do not give it to me, for I have promi&s;ed to tell him every thing you &s;ay to me."</P>
<P>"And every thing I <HI>have</HI> &s;aid?" a&s;ked Ru&s;hbrook ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"As to what you have &s;aid, I don't know whether it has made that impre&s;|&s;ion on my memory, to repeat."</P>
<P>"I am glad it has not."</P>
<P>"And my an&s;wer to your uncle, is to be &s;imply, that you will not obey him?"</P>
<P>"I &s;hould hope, Mr. Sandford, you would put it in better terms."</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="101">"Tell me the terms, and I will be exact."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook &s;truck his forehead, and walked di&s;tractedly about the room.</P>
<P>"Am I to give him any rea&s;on for your di&s;obeying him?"</P>
<P>"I tell you again, I dare not name the cau&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then why do you &s;ubmit to a power you are a&s;hamed to own?"</P>
<P>"I am not a&s;hamed&mdash;I glory in it&mdash; Are you a&s;hamed of your e&s;teem for Lady Matilda?"</P>
<P>"Oh! if &s;he is the cau&s;e of your di&s;obedience, be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall not men|tion it, for I am forbid to name her."</P>
<P>"And as that is the ca&s;e, I need not fear to &s;peak plainly to you. &mdash; I love Lady Matilda &mdash; or, unacquainted with love, perhaps it is only pity&mdash;and if &s;o, pity is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion that ever
<PB N="99" REF="102">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a human heart, and I would not change it for all her father's e&s;tates."</P>
<P>"Pity, then, gives rife to very diffe|rent &s;en&s;ations&mdash;for I pity you, and that &s;en&s;ation I would gladly exchange for approbation."</P>
<P>"If you really feel compa&s;&s;ion for me, and I believe you do, contrive &s;ome means by your an&s;wers to Lord Elmwood to pacify him, without involving me.&mdash; Hint at my affections being engaged, but not to whom; and add, that I have given my word, if he will allow me a &s;hort time, a year or two only, I will, during that period, try to regain them, and u&s;e all my power to render my&s;elf worthy the lady for whom he de&s;igns me."</P>
<P>"And this is not only your &s;olemn promi&s;e &mdash; but your fixed determina|tion?"</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="103">"Nay, why will you &s;earch my heart to the bottom, when its &s;urface ought to content you?"</P>
<P>"If you cannot re&s;olve on what you have propo&s;ed, why do you a&s;k this time of your uncle? for &s;hould he allow it you, at its expiration, your di&s;obedience to his commands will be le&s;s pardonable than it is now."</P>
<P>"Within a year, Mr. Sandford, who can tell what &s;trange unthought-of events may not occur to change all our pro&s;|pects? even my pa&s;&s;ion may decline."</P>
<P>"In that expectation, then&mdash;the fai|lure of which you your&s;elf mu&s;t an&s;wer for &mdash; I will repeat to his Lord&s;hip, as much of this di&s;cour&s;e as &s;hall be pro|per."</P>
<P>Here Ru&s;hbrook communicated his having been to &s;ee Lady Matilda, for
<PB N="101" REF="104">
which Sandford reproved him, but in le&s;s &s;evere terms than his reproofs were in general delivered; and Ru&s;hbrook by his entreaties, now gained the intel|ligence who the nobleman was who had addre&s;t Matilda, and on what views; but was re&s;trained to patience by Sand|ford's arguments and threats.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ubject of this marriage Sandford met his patron, without having determined exactly what to &s;ay, but re&s;t|ed on the temper in which he &s;hould find his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the conver|&s;ation he &s;aid, "Ru&s;hbrook begged for time."</P>
<P>"I have given him time, have I not?" cried Lord Elmwood, "What
<PB N="102" REF="105">
can be the rea&s;on of his thus trifling with me?"</P>
<P>Sandford replied, "My Lord, young men are frequently romantic in their no|tions of love, and think it impo&s;&s;ible to have a &s;incere affection, where their own inclinations do not fir&s;t point out the choice."</P>
<P>"If he is in love," an&s;wered his Lord|&s;hip, "let him take the object, and leave my hou&s;e and me for ever.&mdash;Nor under this de&s;tiny need he be pitied; for genuine love will make him happy in bani&s;hment, in poverty, or in &s;ickne&s;s; it makes the poor man happy as the rich, the fool ble&s;t as the wi&s;e." &mdash; The &s;incerity with which Lord Elm|wood had loved, was expre&s;&s;ed more than in words, as he &s;aid this.</P>
<P>"Your Lord&s;hip is talking," replied Sandford, "of the pa&s;&s;ion in its mo&s;t
<PB N="103" REF="106">
refined and predominant &s;en&s;e; while I may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;peaking of a mere phan|tom, that has led this young man a&s;tray."</P>
<P>"Whatever it be," returned Lord Elmwood, "let him and his friends weigh the ca&s;e well, and act for the be&s;t &mdash;&s;o &s;hall I."</P>
<P>"His friends, my Lord? &mdash; What friends, or what friend has he on earth but you?"</P>
<P>"Then why will he not &s;ubmit to my advice; or him&s;elf give me &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on why he cannot?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e there may be friend&s;hip without familiarity&mdash;and &s;o it is between him and you."</P>
<P>"That cannot be; for I have conde|&s;cended to talk to him in the mo&s;t familiar terms."</P>
<P>"To conde&s;cend, my Lord, is <HI>not</HI> to be familiar."</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="107">"Then come, Sir, let us be on an equal footing through you. &mdash; And now &s;peak out <HI>his</HI> thoughts freely, and hear mine in return."</P>
<P>"Why then, he begs for a re&s;pite for a year or two."</P>
<P>"On what pretence?"</P>
<P>"To me, it was preference to a &s;ingle life &mdash; but I &s;u&s;pect it is&mdash;what he imagines to be love &mdash; and for &s;ome ob|ject whom he thinks your Lord&s;hip would di&s;approve for his wife."</P>
<P>"He has not, then, actually confe&s;&s;|ed this to you?"</P>
<P>"If he has, it was drawn from him by &s;uch means, I am not warranted to &s;ay &s;o in direct words."</P>
<P>"I have entered into no contract, no agreement on his account with the friends of the Lady I have pointed out," &s;aid Lord Elmwood; "nothing beyond im|plications
<PB N="105" REF="108">
have pa&s;&s;ed betwixt her family and my&s;elf at pre&s;ent; and if the per&s;on on whom he has fixed his affections &s;hould not be in a &s;ituation ab&s;olutely contrary to my wi&s;hes, I may, perhaps, confirm his choice."</P>
<P>That moment Sandford's courage prompted him to name Lady Matilda, but his di&s;cretion oppo&s;ed&mdash;however, in the various changes of his countenance from the conflict, it was plain to di&s;cern he wi&s;hed to &s;ay more than he dared.</P>
<P>On which Lord Elmwood cried, "Speak on Sandford &mdash; what are you afraid of?"</P>
<P>"Of you, my Lord."</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;tarted.</P>
<P>Sandford went on &mdash; "I know no tie&mdash;no bond&mdash;no innocence, a protec|tion from your re&s;entment."</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109">"You are right." he replied, &s;ignifi|cantly.</P>
<P>"Then how, my Lord, can you en|courage me to &s;peak on, when that which I perhaps would &s;ay, may offend you to hear?"</P>
<P>"To what, and whither are you <HI>changing</HI> our &s;ubject?" &s;aid his Lord&s;hip. &mdash;"But, Sir, if you know my re&s;entful and relentle&s;s temper, you &s;urely know how to &s;hun it."</P>
<P>"Not, and &s;peak plainly."</P>
<P>"Then di&s;&s;emble."</P>
<P>"No, I'll not do that &mdash; but I'll be &s;ilent."</P>
<P>"A new parade of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;You are more tormenting to me than any one I have about me &mdash; Con&s;tantly on the verge of di&s;obeying my commands, that you may recede, and gain my good will by your forbearance. &mdash; But know, Mr. Sandford, I will not &s;uffer this much
<PB N="107" REF="110">
longer. &mdash; If you choo&s;e upon every oc|ca&s;ion we conver&s;e together (though the mo&s;t remote from the &s;ubject) to think upon my daughter, you mu&s;t either bani&s;h your thoughts, or conceal them&mdash;nor by one &s;ign, one item, remind me of her."</P>
<P>"Your daughter did you call her?&mdash; Can you call your&s;elf her father?"</P>
<P>"I do, Sir &mdash; but I am likewi&s;e the hu&s;band of her mother.&mdash;And, as &s;uch, I &s;olemnly &s;wear,"&mdash; He was proceeding with violence.</P>
<P>"Oh! my Lord," cried Sandford, interrupting him, with his hands cla&s;ped in the mo&s;t fervent &s;upplication&mdash;"Oh! do not let me draw upon her one oath more of your eternal di&s;plea&s;ure &mdash; I'll kneel to beg you to drop the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>The inclination he made with his knees bent to the ground, &s;topped Lord Elmwood in&s;tantly. &mdash; But though it
<PB N="108" REF="111">
broke in upon his words, it did not alter one angry look&mdash;his eyes darted and his lips trembled with indignation.</P>
<P>Sandford in order to appea&s;e him, bowed and offered to withdraw; hoping to be recalled. &mdash; He wi&s;hed in vain &mdash; Lord Elmwood's eyes followed him to the door, expre&s;&s;ive of the plea&s;ure of his ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>THE companions and coun&s;ellors of Lord Margrave, who had &s;o prudently advi&s;ed gentle methods in the pur|&s;uit of his pa&s;&s;ion, while there was left any hope of their &s;ucce&s;s; now, con|vinced there was none, as &s;trenuou&s;ly commended open violence;&mdash;and &s;hel|tered under the con&s;ideration, that their depredations were to be practi&s;ed upon a defencele&s;s woman, who had not one pro|tector, except an old prie&s;t, the &s;ubject of their ridicule;&mdash;a&s;&s;ured likewi&s;e from the influence of Lord Margrave's wealth, all inferior con&s;equences could be over|borne, they &s;aw no room for fears on

any &s;ide, and what they wi&s;hed to exe|cute, with care and &s;kill premeditated.</P>
<P>When their &s;cheme was mature for per|formance, three of his Lord&s;hip's cho&s;en companions, with three &s;ervants, trained and tried in all the villainous exploits of their ma&s;ters, &s;et off for the habitation of poor Matilda, and arrived there about the twilight of the evening.</P>
<P>Near four hours after that time (ju&s;t as the family were going to bed) they came up to the doors of the hou&s;e, and rapping violently, gave the alarm of fire, "conjuring all the inhabitants to make their way out immediately, as they would &s;ave their lives."</P>
<P>The family con&s;i&s;ted of but few per|&s;ons, all of whom ran in&s;tantly to the doors and opened them; on which two
<PB N="111" REF="114">
men ru&s;hed in, and with the plea of &s;aving Lady Matilda from the pretended flames, caught her in their arms, and carried her off; while all the deceived people of the hou&s;e, running eagerly to &s;ave them&s;elves, paid no regard to her being taken away, till looking for the cau&s;e for which they had been terrified, they perceived the &s;tratagem, and the fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the complaints, &s;orrow, and affright of the people of the farm, Mi&s;s Woodley's &s;en&s;ations wanted a name &mdash; terror and angui&s;h give but a faint de|&s;cription of what &s;he &s;uffered&mdash;&s;omething like the approach of death &s;tole over her &s;en&s;es, and &s;he &s;at like one petrified with horror.&mdash;She had no doubt who was the perpetrator of this wickedne&s;s; but
<PB N="112" REF="115">
how was &s;he to follow? how effect a re&s;|cue?</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of this event, as &s;oon as the people had time to call up their recollection, were &s;ent to a neigh|bouring magi&s;trate; but little could be hoped from that.&mdash;Who was to &s;wear to the robber?&mdash;Who undertake to find him out? &mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley thought of Ru&s;hbrook, of Sandford, of Lord Elm|wood, but what could &s;he hope from the want of power in the two former?&mdash;what from the latter, for the want of will? &mdash; Now &s;tupified, and now di&s;tracted, &s;he walked about the hou&s;e ince&s;&s;antly, beg|ging for in&s;tructions what &s;he &s;hould do, or how to forget her mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>A tenant of Lord Elmwood's, who occupied a &s;mall farm near to that where
<PB N="113" REF="116">
Lady Matilda lived, and who was well acquainted with the whole hi&s;tory of hers and her mother's misfortunes, was return|ing from a neighbouring fair ju&s;t as this inhuman plan was put in execution. &mdash; He heard the cries of a woman in di&s;tre&s;s, and followed the &s;ound till he arrived at a chai&s;e in waiting, and &s;aw Matilda placed in it by the &s;ide of two men, who pre&s;ented pi&s;tols to him as he offered to approach and ex|po&s;tulate.</P>
<P>The farmer, uncertain who this female was, yet went to the hou&s;e &s;he had been taken from (as the neare&s;t) with the tale of what he had &s;een; and there, being informed Lady Matilda was her whom he had beheld, this intelligence, joined to the powerful effect her &s;creams had on him, made him re&s;olve to take hor&s;e immediately, and with &s;ome friends, fol|low
<PB N="114" REF="117">
the carriage till they &s;hould trace the place to which &s;he was conveyed.</P>
<P>The anxiety, the firmne&s;s di&s;cover|ed in determining on this undertaking, &s;omething alleviated the agony Mi&s;s Woodley endured, and &s;he began to hope timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance might yet be given to her beloved charge.</P>
<P>The man &s;et out, meaning at all events to attempt her relea&s;e; but before he had proceeded far, the few friends that ac|companied him began to reflect on the improbability of their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t a nobleman, &s;urrounded by &s;ervants, with other attendants likewi&s;e, and perhaps even countenanced by the lady's father, whom they pre&s;umed to take from him;&mdash; or if not, while Lord Elmwood beheld the offence with indifference, that was

giving it a &s;anction, they might in vain oppo&s;e.&mdash;The&s;e cool reflections, tending to their &s;afety, had their weight with the companions of the farmer; they all rode back rejoicing at their &s;econd thoughts, and left him to pur&s;ue his journey and prove his valour by him&s;elf.</P>

<P>IT was not with Sandford, as it had lately been with Ru&s;hbrook under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Lord Elmwood &mdash; to the latter his Lord&s;hip behaved, as &s;oon as their di&s;&s;ention was over, as if it had never happened&mdash;but to Sandford it was otherwi&s;e; and that re&s;entment which he had repre&s;&s;ed at the time of the of|fence, lurked in his heart and dwelt upon his mind for &s;everal days; during which, he carefully avoided exchanging a word with him, and gave every other demon&s;tration of his anger.</P>
<P>Sandford, who was experienced in the cruelty and ingratitude of the world, yet
<PB N="117" REF="120">
could not without difficulty brook this &s;everity, this contumely, from a man, for who&s;e welfare, ever &s;ince his infancy, he had laboured; and who&s;e happine&s;s was &s;till more dear to him, in &s;pite of all his faults, than any other per&s;on's.&mdash; Even Lady Matilda was not &s;o dear to Sandford as her father &mdash; and he loved her more that &s;he was Lord Elmwood's child, than for any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes the old man, incen&s;ed be|yond bearing, was on the point of &s;ay|ing to his patron, "How, in my age, dare you thus treat the man, whom in his youth you re&s;pected and revered?"</P>
<P>Sometimes in&s;tead of anger, he felt the tear, he was a&s;hamed to own, &s;teal to his eye, and even fall down his cheek. &mdash; Sometimes he left the room half de|termined
<PB N="118" REF="121">
to leave the hou&s;e &mdash; but the&s;e were all but half determinations; for he knew him with whom he had to deal too well, not to know he might be provoked to greater anger yet; and that &s;hould he once ra&s;hly quit his hou&s;e, the doors mo&s;t probably would be &s;hut to him for ever.</P>
<P>In this humiliating and degraded &s;tate (for even dome&s;tics could not but ob|&s;erve their Lord's di&s;plea&s;ure) Sandford pa&s;&s;ed three days, and was beginning the fourth, when &s;itting with his Lord&s;hip and Ru&s;hbrook ju&s;t after breakfa&s;t, a &s;ervant entered, &s;aying as he opened the door to &s;omebody who followed, "You mu&s;t wait till you have my Lord's per|mi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="122">This attracted their eyes to the door, and a man meanly dre&s;&s;ed, walked in, following clo&s;e to the &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The latter turned, and &s;eemed again to de&s;ire the per&s;on to retire, but all in vain; he ru&s;hed forward regardle&s;s of his oppo&s;er, and in great agitation, cried,</P>
<P>"My Lord, if you plea&s;e, I have bu|&s;ine&s;s with you, provided you will choo&s;e to be alone."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood, &s;truck with the &s;tran|ger's earne&s;tne&s;s, bade the &s;ervant leave the room; and then &s;aid to him,</P>
<P>"You may &s;peak before the&s;e gen|tlemen."</P>
<P>The man in&s;tantly turned pale, and trembled&mdash;then, to prolong the time be|fore he &s;poke, went to the door to &s;ee if it was &s;hut&mdash;returned&mdash;yet &s;till trem|bling, &s;eemed unwilling to &s;ay his errand.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="123">"What have you done," cried Lord Elmwood, "that you are in this terror?" What have you done, man?"</P>
<P>"Nothing, my Lord," replied he, "but I am afraid I am going to offend you."</P>
<P>"Well, no matter;" (an&s;wered his Lord&s;hip carele&s;&s;ly) "only go on, and let me know your bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>The man's di&s;tre&s;s increa&s;ed&mdash;the wa|ter came to his eyes &mdash; and he cried in a voice of grief and of affright &mdash; "Your child, my Lord!"&mdash;</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook and Sandford &s;tarted; and looking at Lord Elmwood, &s;aw him turn white as death. &mdash; In a tremulous voice he in&s;tantly cried,</P>
<P>"What of her?" and ro&s;e from his &s;eat.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="124">Encouraged by the que&s;tion, the poor man gave way to his feelings, and an|&s;wered with every &s;ign of &s;orrow,</P>
<P>"I &s;aw her, my Lord, taken away by force&mdash;two ruffians &s;eized and car|ried her away, while &s;he &s;creamed in vain to me for help, and tore her hair in di&s;traction."</P>
<P>"Man, what do you mean?" cried his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Lord Margrave," returned the &s;tran|ger, "we have no doubt has formed the plot&mdash;he has for &s;ome time pa&s;t be&s;et the hou&s;e where &s;he lived; and when his vi&s;its were refu&s;ed, he threatened this. &mdash;Be&s;ides, one of his &s;ervants attended the carriage; I &s;aw, and knew him."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood li&s;tened to the la&s;t part of this account with &s;eeming compo|&s;ure&mdash;then turning ha&s;tily to Ru&s;hbrook, he &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="125">"Where are my pi&s;tols, Harry?"</P>
<P>Sandford ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and for|getting all the anger between them, caught hold of his Lord&s;hip's hand, and cried, "Will you then prove your&s;elf a father?"</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood only an&s;wered, "Yes." and left the room.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook followed, and begged with all the earne&s;tne&s;s he felt, to be permit|ted to accompany his uncle.</P>
<P>While Sandford &s;haked hands with the farmer a thou&s;and times.</P>
<P>And he, in his turn, rejoiced as if he had already &s;een Lady Matilda re&s;tored to liberty.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook in vain entreated Lord Elmwood; he laid his commands upon him not to &s;tir from the ca&s;tle; while the
<PB N="123" REF="126">
agitation of his own mind was too great to ob&s;erve the rigour of this &s;entence upon his nephew.</P>
<P>During the ha&s;ty preparations for his Lord&s;hip's departure, Sandford received from Mi&s;s Woodley the &s;ad intelligence of what had happened;&mdash;but he return|ed an an&s;wer to recompen&s;e her for all &s;he had undergone.</P>

<P>LORD Margrave, black as this in|cident in his &s;tory mu&s;t make him to the reader, &s;till nur&s;ed in his con|&s;cience a re&s;erve of virtue, to keep him in peace with him&s;elf.&mdash;It was his de&s;ign to plead, to argue, to implore, nay even to threaten, long before he put his threats in force;&mdash;and with this and the follow|ing reflection he reconciled &mdash; as mo&s;t bad men can &mdash; what he had done, not only to the laws of humanity, but to the laws of honour.</P>
<P>"I have &s;tolen a woman certainly;" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "but I will make
<PB N="125" REF="128">
her happier than &s;he was in that humble &s;tate from whence I have taken her.&mdash;I will even," &s;aid he, "now &s;he is in my power, win her affections&mdash;and when, in fondne&s;s, &s;he &s;hall hereafter hang upon me, how will &s;he thank me for this little trial, through which &s;he will have pa&s;&s;ed to happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>Thus did his Lord&s;hip hu&s;h his re|mor&s;e, while he waited impatiently at home, in expectation of his prize.</P>
<P>Half expiring with her &s;ufferings, in body as well as in mind, about twelve o'clock the next night Matilda arrived; and felt her &s;pirits revive by the &s;till greater &s;ufferings that awaited &mdash; for her encrea&s;ing terrors now rouzed her from that death-like weakne&s;s, brought on by fatigue.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129">Lord Margrave's hou&s;e, to which he had gone previous to this occa&s;ion, was &s;i|tuated in the lonely part of a well-known fore&s;t, not more than twenty miles di&s;tant from London:&mdash;this was an e&s;tate he rarely vi&s;ited; and as he had but few of his &s;ervants here, it was a place which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be le&s;s the object of &s;u&s;picion in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, than any other of his &s;eats. To this, then, Lady Matilda was conveyed &mdash; a mo&s;t &s;uperb apartment allotted her&mdash;and one of his Lord&s;hip's confidential females placed to attend upon her, with all re&s;pect, and a&s;&s;urances of &s;afety.</P>
<P>Matilda looked in this woman's face, and &s;eeing &s;he bore the features of her &s;ex, while her knowledge reached none of tho&s;e worthle&s;s characters of which this per&s;on was a &s;pecimen, &s;he imagined
<PB N="127" REF="130">
none of tho&s;e could look as &s;he did, and therefore found con&s;olation in her &s;eem|ing tenderne&s;s.&mdash;She was even prevailed upon (by her promi&s;es to &s;it by her &s;ide and watch) to throw her&s;elf on the bed, and &s;uffer a few minutes &s;leep&mdash; for &s;leep to her was &s;uffering; her fears giving birth to dreams terrifying as her waking thoughts.</P>
<P>More wearied than refre&s;hed with her &s;leep, &s;he ro&s;e at break of day, and re|fu&s;ing to admit of an article in the change of her dre&s;s, &s;he per&s;i&s;ted to fit in the torn di&s;hordered habit in which &s;he had been dragged away; nor would &s;he ta&s;te a mor&s;el of all the delicacies that were prepared for her.</P>
<P>Her attendant for &s;ome time ob&s;erved the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and reverential awe;
<PB N="128" REF="131">
but finding this had not the effect of gaining compliance to her advice, &s;he varied her manners, and began by le&s;s &s;ervile means to attempt an influence.&mdash; She &s;aid her orders were to be obedient, while &s;he her&s;elf was obeyed&mdash;at lea&s;t in circum&s;tances &s;o material as the lady's health, of which &s;he had the charge as a phy&s;ician, and expected equal compli|ance from her patient &mdash; food and fre&s;h apparel &s;he pre&s;cribed as the only means to prevent death; and even threatened her invalid with &s;omething wor&s;e, a vi&s;it from Lord Margrave, if &s;he continued ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>Now loathing her for the deception &s;he had practi&s;ed, more, than had &s;he re|ceived her thus at fir&s;t, Matilda hid her eyes from the &s;ight of her; and when &s;he was obliged to look, &s;he &s;huddered.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132">This female at length thought it her duty to wait upon her worthy employer, and inform him the young lady in her tru&s;t would certainly die, unle&s;s there were means employed to oblige her to take &s;ome nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Lord Margrave, glad of an opportunity that might apologi&s;e for his intru&s;ion upon Lady Matilda, went with eager|ne&s;s to her apartment, and throwing him&s;elf at her feet, conjured her if &s;he would &s;ave his life, as well as her own, to &s;ubmit to be con&s;oled.</P>
<P>The extreme di&s;gu&s;t and horror his pre&s;ence in&s;pired, cau&s;ed Matilda for a moment to forget all her weakne&s;s, her want of health, her want of power; and ri&s;ing from the place where &s;he &s;at, &s;he cried, with her voice elevated,</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="133">"Leave me, my Lord, or I'll die in &s;pite of all your care; I'll in&s;tantly expire with grief, if you do not leave me."</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed to the tears and reproaches of the &s;ex&mdash;though not of any like her&mdash; his Lord&s;hip treated with contempt tho&s;e menaces of anger, and &s;eizing her hand, carried it to his lips.</P>
<P>Enraged, and overwhelmed with &s;or|row at the affront, &s;he cried, (forgetting every other friend &s;he had,) "Oh! my dear Mi&s;s Woodley, why are you not here to take my part?"</P>
<P>"Nay," returned his Lord&s;hip, &s;ti|fling a fit of laughter, "I &s;hould think the old prie&s;t, would be as good a champion as the lady."</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="134">The memory of Sandford with all his kindne&s;s, now ru&s;hed &s;o forcibly on Ma|tilda's mind, &s;he &s;hed a &s;hower of tears, thinking how much he felt, and would continue to feel, for her &s;ituation.&mdash;Once &s;he thought on Ru&s;hbrook too, and thought even <HI>he</HI> would be vext for her. &mdash; Of her father &s;he did not think&mdash;&s;he dur&s;t not &mdash; one &s;ingle time the thought intruded, but &s;he hurried it away&mdash;it was too bitter.</P>
<P>It was now quite night again; and near to that hour &s;he came fir&s;t to the hou&s;e. &mdash; Lord Margrave, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from her, remained &s;till in her apartment; while her female com|panion had &s;tolen away. &mdash; His in&s;en&s;i|bility to her lamentations &mdash; the agitated looks he &s;ometimes ca&s;t upon her &mdash;
<PB N="132" REF="135">
her weakly and defencele&s;s &s;tate, all con&s;pired to fill her mind with ho|nour.</P>
<P>He &s;aw her apprehen&s;ions pictured in her di&s;tracted face, di&s;heveled hair, and the whole of her forlorn appearance, &mdash; yet, notwith&s;tanding his former re|&s;olves, he could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of fulfilling all her dreadful expectations.</P>
<P>He once again approached her, and was going again to take her hand; when the report of a pi&s;tol on the &s;tairca&s;e, and a confu&s;ion of per&s;ons a&s;embling towards the apartment deterred him.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted&mdash;but looked more &s;urpri&s;ed than alarmed; while her alarm aug|mented; for &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed this tumult was &s;ome experiment to intimidate her
<PB N="133" REF="136">
into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;She therefore wrung her hands, and lifted up her eyes to heaven in the la&s;t agony of de&s;pair, when one of Lord Margrave's &s;ervants entered ha&s;tily and cried,</P>
<P>"Lord Elmwood, Sir."</P>
<P>That moment her father entered &mdash; and with the unre&s;trained fondne&s;s of a parent, folded her in his arms."</P>
<P>Her extreme, her exce&s;s of joy on &s;uch a meeting; and from &s;uch angui&s;h re&s;cued, was &s;till, in part, repre&s;&s;ed by his awful pre&s;ence.&mdash;The apprehen&s;ions to which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed, kept her timid and doubtful &mdash; &s;he feared to &s;peak, or cla&s;p him in return for his em|brace, but falling on her knees clung round his legs, and bathed his feet with her tears. &mdash; The&s;e were the happie&s;t
<PB N="134" REF="137">
moments &s;he had ever known&mdash;perhaps the happie&s;t <HI>he</HI> had ever known.</P>
<P>Lord Margrave, on whom Lord Elm|wood had not even ca&s;t a look, now left the room; but as he quitted it, call|ed out,</P>
<P>"My Lord Elmwood, if you have any demands on me"&mdash;</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip interrupted him, &mdash; "Would you make me an executioner? The law &s;hall be your only antagoni&s;t."</P>
<P>Matilda, quite exhau&s;ted, yet upheld by the &s;udden tran&s;port &s;he had felt, walked, as her father led her, out of this wretched dwelling&mdash;more de&s;picable than the cottage built with clay.</P>

<P>OVERCOME with the want of two night's re&s;t from her cruel fears, and all tho&s;e fears now hu&s;hed; Matilda &s;oon after &s;he was placed in the carriage with Lord Elmwood, dropped fa&s;t a&s;leep; and thus in&s;en&s;ibly &s;urpri&s;ed, leaned her head again&s;t her father in the &s;weete&s;t &s;lumber imagination can conceive.</P>
<P>When &s;he awoke, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual melancholy pro&s;pect before her view, &s;he heard the voice of the late dreaded Lord Elmwood, tenderly &s;aying,</P>
<P>"We will go no farther to-night, the fatigue is too much for her; &mdash; order
<PB N="136" REF="139">
beds here directly, and &s;ome proper per|&s;ons to &s;it up and attend her."</P>
<P>She could only turn to him with a look of love and duty; her tongue could not utter a &s;entence.</P>
<P>In the morning &s;he found her father by the &s;ide of her bed.&mdash;He inquired "If &s;he was in health &s;ufficient to pur|&s;ue her journey, or if &s;he would remain where &s;he was?"</P>
<P>"I am able to go with you." &s;he an&s;wered in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>"Nay," replied he, "perhaps you ought to &s;tay here till you are better?"</P>
<P>"I <HI>am</HI> better," &s;aid &s;he, "and rea|dy to go with you." &mdash; Half afraid he meant to &s;end her from him.</P>
<P>He perceived her fears, and replied, "Nay, if you &s;tay, &s;o &s;hall I &mdash; and
<PB N="137" REF="140">
when I go, I &s;hall take you along with me to my hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"To Elmwood Hou&s;e?" &s;he a&s;ked eagerly.</P>
<P>"No, to my hou&s;e in town, where I intend to be all the winter, and where we &s;hall live together."</P>
<P>She turned her face on the pillow to conceal her tears of joy, but her &s;obs revealed them.</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid he, "this ki&s;s is a token you have nothing to fear."&mdash;And he ki&s;&s;ed her affectionately. &mdash; "I &s;hall &s;end too for Mi&s;s Woodley immediately." continued he.</P>
<P>"Oh! I &s;hall be overjoyed to &s;ee her, my Lord &mdash; and to &s;ee Mr. Sand|ford &mdash; and even Mr. Ru&s;hbrook."</P>
<P>"Do you know him?" &s;aid Lord Elmwood.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141">"Yes," &s;he replied, "I have &s;een him twice."</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip hoping the air might be a means of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing her &s;trength and &s;pirits, now left the room and or|dered his carriage; while &s;he aro&s;e, at|tended by one of his female &s;ervants, for whom he had &s;ent to town, to bring &s;uch changes of apparel as was requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>When Matilda was ready to join her father in the next room, &s;he felt a tre|mor &s;eize her, that made it almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to appear before him.&mdash;No other circum&s;tance now depending to agitate her heart, &s;he felt more forcibly its em|barra&s;&s;ment at meeting on terms of ea&s;y intercour&s;e, him, whom &s;he had been u&s;ed to think of, but with that di&s;tant
<PB N="139" REF="142">
reverence and fear, which his &s;everity had excited; and &s;he knew not how to dare to &s;peak, or look on him with that freedom her affection warranted.</P>
<P>After &s;everal efforts to conquer the&s;e nice and refined &s;en&s;ations, but to no purpo&s;e, &s;he went at la&s;t to his apart|ment.&mdash;He was reading; but as &s;he en|tered, put out his hand and drew her to him.&mdash;Her tears wholly overcame her.&mdash; He could have intermingled his &mdash; but a&s;&s;uming a grave countenance, he com|manded her to de&s;i&s;t from exhau&s;ting her &s;pirits; and, after a few powerful &s;truggles, &s;he obeyed.</P>
<P>Before the morning was over &s;he ex|perienced the extreme joy of &s;itting by her father's &s;ide as they drove to town, and receiving during his conver&s;ation,
<PB N="140" REF="143">
a thou&s;and proofs of his love, and tokens of her la&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>

<P>RUSHBROOK was detained at Elm|wood Hou&s;e during all this time, more from the friendly per&s;ua&s;ions, nay even prayers, of Sandford, than by the com|mands of Lord Elmwood. He had, but for Sandford, followed his uncle and ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf to his &s;evere&s;t anger, rather than have endured a &s;tate of the mo&s;t piercing inquietude, &s;uch as he &s;uffered till the news arrived of Lady Matilda's &s;afety. &mdash; He indeed had little el&s;e to fear from the known, firm, and coura|geous character of her father, and the expedition with which he undertook his journey; but lover's fears are like tho&s;e
<PB N="143" REF="146">
of women, and no argument could per|&s;uade either him or Mi&s;s Woodley (who had now ventured to come to Elmwood Hou&s;e) but that Matilda's peace of mind might be for ever de&s;troyed before &s;he was &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>The &s;ummons from Lord Elmwood for their coming to town, was received by each of this party with delight; but the impatience to obey it was in Ru&s;h|brook &s;o violent, it was painful to him|&s;elf, and extremely trouble&s;ome to Sand|ford; who wi&s;hed, from his regard to Lady Matilda, rather to delay, than hurry their journey.</P>
<P>"You are to blame," &s;aid he to him and to Mi&s;s Woodley, "to wi&s;h by your arrival, to divide with Lord Elmwood that tender tie, with which obligations conferred ever binds the donor. &mdash; At
<PB N="144" REF="147">
pre&s;ent there is no one with him to &s;hare in the care and protection of his daugh|ter, and he is under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|charging the duty him&s;elf; accu&s;tomed to this, it may become &s;o powerful he cannot throw it off, even if his former re&s;olutions &s;hould urge him to it.&mdash;While we remain here, therefore, Lady Ma|tilda is &s;afe with her father; but it would not &s;urpri&s;e me, if on our arrival (e&s;pe|cially if we are precipitate) he &s;hould place her again with Mi&s;s Woodley at a di&s;tance."</P>
<P>To this forcible conjecture, they &s;ub|mitted for a few days, and then mo&s;t gladly &s;et out for town.</P>
<P>On their arrival, they were met, even at the door of the &s;treet, by Lady Ma|tilda; and with an expre&s;&s;ion of joy, they did not &s;uppo&s;e her features could

<P>When Lord Elmwood joined them, he welcomed them all mo&s;t &s;incerely; e&s;pecially Sandford; with whom he had not &s;poken for many days before he left the country, merely for his alluding to the wretched &s;ituation of his daughter&mdash; And Sandford (with his fellow travellers) now &s;aw his Lord&s;hip treat that daughter with all the ea&s;y, natural fondne&s;s, as if &s;he had lived with him from her infancy. &mdash; He appeared, however, at times, under the apprehen&s;ion, that the pro|pen&s;ity of man to jealou&s;y, might give Ru&s;hbrook a pang at this dangerous
<PB N="146" REF="149">
rival in his love and fortune&mdash;for though his Lord&s;hip remembered well the ha|zard he had once ventured to befriend Matilda, yet the pre&s;ent unlimited recon|ciliation was &s;omething &s;o unlooked for, it might be a trial too much for his gene|ro&s;ity, to remain wholly di&s;intere&s;ted on the event.&mdash;Slight as was this &s;u&s;picion, it did Ru&s;hbrook inju&s;tice. &mdash; He loved Lady Matilda too &s;incerely; he loved her father's happine&s;s, and her mother's memory too faithfully, not to be rejoiced at all he was witne&s;s of; nor did the &s;ecret hope that whi&s;pered to him "There every ble&s;&s;ing might one day be mutual," increa&s;e the plea&s;ure he found, in beholding Matilda happy.</P>
<P>Unexpected affairs in which Lord Elmwood had been for &s;ome time en|gaged,
<PB N="147" REF="150">
diverted his attention for a while from the marriage of his nephew; nor did he at this time find his di&s;po&s;ition &s;ufficiently &s;evere to exact from the young man a compliance with his wi&s;hes, at the cruel alternative of being for ever di&s;carded.&mdash;He felt his mind, by the late incident, too much &s;oftened for &s;uch har&s;hne&s;s; he yet wi&s;hed for the alliance he had propo&s;ed; for he was more con|&s;i&s;tent in his character than to &s;uffer the &s;udden tenderne&s;s his daughter's danger had awakened, to derange tho&s;e plans &s;o long projected; and never for a mo|ment did he indulge&mdash;for perhaps it had been an indulgence &mdash; the idea of re|placing her exactly in that &s;ituation to which &s;he was born, to the di&s;appoint|ment of all his nephew's expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="151">Milder now in his temper than he had been for years before, and knowing he could be no longer irritated upon the &s;ubject of his daughter, his Lord&s;hip once more re&s;olved to tru&s;t him&s;elf in a conference with Ru&s;hbrook on the &s;ub|ject of marriage, meaning at the &s;ame time to mention Matilda as an opponent from whom he had nothing to fear.

<P>Lord Elmwood de&s;ired to know "On whom he had placed his affections."</P>
<P>"I dare not tell you, my Lord,"&mdash; returned he, infinitely confu&s;ed; "but Mr. Sandford can witne&s;s their &s;incerity, and how long they have been fixed."</P>
<P>"Fixed!" cried his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Immoveably fixed, my Lord; and yet the object is as unknowing of it to
<PB N="150" REF="153">
this moment as you your&s;elf have been; and I &s;wear ever &s;hall be &s;o, without your permi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Name the object." &s;aid Lord Elm|wood, anxiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"My Lord, I dare not&mdash;the la&s;t time I named her to you, you threatened to abandon me for my arrogance."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood &s;tarted.&mdash; "My daughter!&mdash;Would you marry her?"</P>
<P>"But with your approbation, my Lord; and that"&mdash;</P>
<P>Before he could proceed a word far|ther, his Lord&s;hip left the room ha&s;tily&mdash; and left Ru&s;hbrook all terror for his ap|proaching fate.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood went immediately into the apartment where Sandford, Mi&s;s Woodley, and Matilda, were &s;it|ting, and cried with an angry voice and with his countenance di&s;ordered,</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="154">"Ru&s;hbrook has offended me be|yond forgivene&s;s.&mdash;Go, Sandford, to the library, where he is, and tell him this in&s;tant to quit my hou&s;e, and never dare to return."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley lifted up her hands and &s;ighed.</P>
<P>Sandford ro&s;e &s;lowly from his &s;eat to execute his office.</P>
<P>While Lady Matilda, who was ar|ranging her mu&s;ic books upon the in|&s;trument, &s;topped from her employ|ment &s;uddenly, with her face bathed in tears.</P>
<P>A general &s;ilence en&s;ued, till Lord Elmwood, re&s;uming his angry tone, cried, "Did you hear me, Mr. Sand|ford?"</P>
<P>Sandford now, without a word in re|ply, made for the door&mdash;but there Ma|tilda
<PB N="152" REF="155">
impeded him, and throwing her arms about his neck, cried,</P>
<P>"Dear Mr. Sandford, do not."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed her father.</P>
<P>She &s;aw the frown that was impending, and ru&s;hing towards him, took his hand fearfully, and knelt at his feet.&mdash;"Mr. Ru&s;hbrook is my relation," &s;he cried in a pathetic voice, "my companion, my friend &mdash; before you loved me he was anxious for my happine&s;s, and often vi&s;ited me to propo&s;e &s;ome kindne&s;s. &mdash; I cannot &s;ee him turned out of your hou&s;e without feeling for him, what he once felt for me."</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood turned a&s;ide to conceal his &s;en&s;ations &mdash; then rai&s;ing her from the floor, he &s;aid, "Do you know what he has a&s;ked of me?"</P>
<P>"No" &mdash; an&s;wered &s;he in the utmo&s;t ignorance, and with the utmo&s;t inno|cence
<PB N="153" REF="156">
painted on her face.&mdash;"But what|ever it is, my Lord, though you do not grant it, yet pardon him for a&s;king."</P>
<P>"Perhaps <HI>you</HI> would grant him what he has reque&s;ted?" &s;aid his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly&mdash;was it in my gift."</P>
<P>"It is." replied he. "And go to him in the library, and hear what he has to &s;ay;&mdash;for on your will his fate &s;hall depend."</P>
<P>Like lightning &s;he flew out of the room; while even the grave Sandford &s;miled at the idea of their meeting.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook, with his fears all verified by the manner in which his uncle had left him, &s;at with his head reclined again&s;t a book ca&s;e, and every limb extended with the de&s;pair that had &s;eized him.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="157">Matilda nimbly opened the door and cried, "Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, I am come to comfort you."</P>
<P>"That you have always done." &s;aid he, ri&s;ing in rapture to receive her, even in the mid&s;t of all his &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>"What is it you want?" &s;aid &s;he. "What have you a&s;ked of my father that he has denied you?"</P>
<P>"I have a&s;ked for that," replied he, "which is dearer to me than my life."</P>
<P>"Be &s;atisfied then," returned &s;he, "for you &s;hall have it."</P>
<P>"Dear Matilda! it is not in your power to be&s;tow."</P>
<P>"But his Lord&s;hip has told me it <HI>&s;hall</HI> be in my power; and has de&s;ired me to give, or to refu&s;e it you, at my own plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"O Heavens!" cried Ru&s;hbrook in tran&s;port, "Has he?"</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158">"He has indeed &mdash; before both Mr. Sandford and Mi&s;s Woodley. &mdash; Now tell me what your petition is?"</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked him," cried Ru&s;hbrook, trembling, "for a wife."</P>
<P>Her hand that had ju&s;t then taken hold of his, in the warmth of her wi&s;h to &s;erve him, now dropped down as with the &s;troke of death&mdash;her face lo&s;t its co|lour &mdash; and &s;he leaned again&s;t the de&s;k by which they were &s;tanding, without uttering a word.</P>
<P>"What means this change?" &s;aid he; "Do you not wi&s;h me happy?"</P>
<P>"Yes." &s;he exclaimed: "Heaven is my witne&s;s.&mdash;But it gives me concern to think we mu&s;t part."</P>
<P>"Then let us be joined," cried he, falling at her feet, "till death alone can part us."</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="159">All the &s;en&s;ibility &mdash; the re&s;erve &mdash; the pride, with which &s;he was &s;o amply po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, returned to her that moment.&mdash; She &s;tarted and cried, "Could Lord Elmwood know for what he &s;ent me?"</P>
<P>"He did." replied Ru&s;hbrook&mdash;"I boldly told him of my pre&s;umptuous love, and he has yielded to you alone, the power over my happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. &mdash;Oh! do not doom me to the latter."</P>
<P>Whether the heart of Matilda, &s;uch as it has been de&s;cribed, <HI>could</HI> &s;entence him to mi&s;ery, the reader is left to &s;ur|mi&s;e&mdash;and if he &s;uppo&s;es that it did not, he has every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e their wedded life was a life of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He has beheld the pernicious effects of an improper education in the de&s;tiny which attended the unthinking Mi&s;s
<PB N="157" REF="160">
Milner &mdash; On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, then, what may not be hoped from that &s;chool of prudence &mdash; though of adver&s;ity &mdash; in which Matilda was bred?</P>
<P>And Mr. Milner, Matilda's grand|father, had better have given his fortune to a di&s;tant branch of his family &mdash; as Matilda's father once meant to do &mdash; &s;o he had be&s;towed upon his daughter A PROPER EDUCATION.</P>
