<HEAD>HENRIETTA. BOOK THE THIRD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our heroine meets with a new di&s;appoint|ment, and &s;ome farther in&s;tances of mi&s;s Woodby's friend&s;hip.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HENRIETTA, being now left to her own reflections, beheld her late conduct in a light in which it had never appeared to her before; the &s;en&s;e of blame &s;o ju&s;tly in|curred, filled her with remor&s;e and &s;hame. Hitherto &s;he had indu&s;triou&s;ly aggravated the cau&s;e of her fears, that &s;he might not &s;tand &s;elf-condemned; which to an ingenuous mind is of all others the greate&s;t evil: but Mrs. Willis had &s;tated her ca&s;e too ju&s;tly.</P>
<P>What force could give her unwilling hand to the old baronet? How could &s;he be cheated into
<PB N="2" REF="9">
a convent, when &s;he was forewarned of the de|&s;ign? From her ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition to her aunt's will, nothing wor&s;e could have hap|pened than the lo&s;s of her favour and protec|tion, which by her flight &s;he had anticipated. She now wondered at the unrea&s;ona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ne&s;s of her fears, and looked back with the deepe&s;t re|gret upon the errors they had occa&s;ioned</P>
<P>The&s;e melancholy thoughts, and her anxiety about the reception her aunt would give her, kept her waking almo&s;t the whole night. As &s;oon as it was light, &s;he ro&s;e, and dre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf, impatient to be gone; Mrs. Willis at her &s;ummons made ha&s;te to join her, and, when they had breakfa&s;ted, &s;et out immediately upon their journey; Henrietta full of perturbation and enquietude, Mrs. Willis with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ity which attends the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing what is right.</P>
<P>The young lady, as &s;he drew nearer her aunt's dwelling, found her emotions increa&s;e; one while her imagination repre&s;ented lady Meadows as kind and indulgent, ready to forgive her error, and to re&s;tore her to her affection; and, imme|diately after, &s;he would tremble with the ap|prehen&s;ion of her &s;evere reproaches.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis perceived her unea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;s, and u&s;ed her utmo&s;t endeavours to compo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="3" REF="10">
but when the chai&s;e &s;topped at the door, &s;he was near falling into a fainting fit; and her friend was obliged to a&s;k if lady Meadows was at home, for Henrietta was not able to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant-maid who opened the door, hav|ing got a glymp&s;e of the young lady as &s;he &s;at in the chai&s;e, eagerly flew to the &s;ide of it&mdash; "O my dear mi&s;s!" &s;aid &s;he, in a tran&s;port of joy, "is it you?"</P>
<P>"How do you do, Jenny?" &s;aid mi&s;s Cour|teney; and trembling, added, "is my aunt at home?"</P>
<P>"My lady," &s;aid the girl,
<Q>&s;et out two days ago for her &s;eat in Devon&s;hire. Oh! mi&s;s, here has been &s;ad doings, poor Mrs. White is turned away; there came an ugly mi&s;chief-making lady from London, and told my lady a heap of &s;tories about you, and &s;o Mrs. White was turned away: but won't you plea&s;e to alight, mi&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta looked at Mrs. Willis, for &s;he knew not her&s;elf what to re&s;olve on, the news &s;he had heard having thrown her into the utmo&s;t per|plexity &mdash; "I wi&s;h we could &s;ee Mrs. White," &s;aid Mrs. Willis to her in a whi&s;per.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney immediately enquired of the maid, how long Mrs. White had left her aunt, and where &s;he was to be found? The girl told
<PB N="4" REF="11">
her &s;he had been gone above a week, and that &s;he believed &s;he was at her &s;i&s;ter's in Wind&s;or, Henrietta had often heard her mention her &s;i&s;ter, who was married to a trade&s;man in Wind&s;or; and, after &s;he had taken leave of the poor affec|tionate girl, who wept to &s;ee her depart again, &s;he gave the po&s;t-boy directions where to drive.</P>
<P>Mrs. White, when the chai&s;e &s;topped at the door, heard from a little parlour where &s;he was &s;itting, the voice of mi&s;s Courteney, enquiring for her, and flew with trembling eagerne&s;s to meet her.</P>
<P>"Oh! mi&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, taking her hand, and leading her into the room,
<Q>I am rejoiced to &s;ee you: where have you been all this time &mdash;What an unfortunate creature was I to be the means of your taking &s;uch a ra&s;h re&s;olu|tion &mdash; Oh! that I had kept what I knew to my&s;elf&mdash; But &s;urely, it was very unkind in you not to acquaint me with your de&s;ign, not to a&s;k my advice. I might have prevented all this trouble; but thank Heaven you are &s;afe and well&mdash;well I &s;ee you are.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta then interrupting the good woman, who, between chiding and fondne&s;s, had taken no notice of Mrs. Willis:
<Q>That I am &s;afe (&s;aid &s;he) I am obliged to this gentlewoman;
<PB N="5" REF="12">
for &s;ome &s;trange treachery was preparing for me, I believe, but her care has prevented it.</Q></P>
<P>"Treachery!" interrupted Mrs. White&mdash;
<Q>Aye, you have met with enough of that, I &s;uppo&s;e: there was your new-found friend and acquaintance, mi&s;s&mdash;I forget her name, whom you told all your &s;ecrets to; you made no &s;cruple to tru&s;t her, mi&s;s, though you was &s;o re&s;erved to me; &s;he was the occa&s;ion of my lo&s;ing my place. Ah! mi&s;s, but I will not upbraid you; I &s;ee you are concerned: God forbid I &s;hould add to your unea&s;ine&s;s; I have &s;uffered greatly upon your account. It was very unkind in you to put it in the power of a &s;tranger to do me &s;o much mi&s;chief: &s;urely I did not de&s;erve &s;uch a return from you. But God knows my heart, I would not upbraid you for the world; no, I &s;corn it; but I have been the greate&s;t &s;ufferer, I am &s;ure, and yet I meant well.</Q></P>
<P>"Was not the lady's name Woodby?" in|terrupted Henrietta, impatient to hear the par|ticulars of this new act of treachery and ba&s;e|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Aye, Woodby," replied Mrs. White,
<Q>a di&s;agreeable creature as ever my eyes beheld. I &s;hall never forget how &s;he &s;idled into my lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room, and, half out of breath,
<PB N="6" REF="13">
told her, &s;he had taken the liberty to wait on her to bring her &s;ome news of her niece. I could not hear di&s;tinctly all &s;he &s;aid, for my lady ordered me to withdraw; but I put my ear to the key-hole, as I had done once be|fore for your &s;ervice mi&s;s, which I have rea|&s;on to repent, Heaven knows&mdash; but what is pa&s;t cannot be helped&mdash; it is not my way to <HI>rip</HI> up things that are pa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>but what did you hear?</Q></P>
<P>"Nay, for that matter," re&s;umed Mrs. White,
<Q>I may draw my&s;elf into another <HI>prem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e</HI> per|haps: after what I have &s;uffered I ought to be cautious; but I love you, mi&s;s, and mu&s;t tell you every thing, whatever it co&s;t me, and that you have experienced already. Well, &s;he made up a horrible &s;tory, that you had gone away &s;uddenly from lodgings where &s;he vi&s;ited you, and notwith&s;tanding the friend&s;hip there was between you, and a great clutter &s;he made with that word, you went away without giv|ing her any notice of your intention; and this &s;he &s;aid had a &s;trange appearance.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney lifted up her eyes here, in a&s;toni&s;hment at what &s;he heard.</P>
<P>"As for me," continued Mrs. White,
<Q>&s;he did my bu&s;ine&s;s in an in&s;tant; for as &s;oon as &s;he
<PB N="7" REF="14">
was gone, my lady &s;ent for me, and, in a violent rage, told me I &s;hould not &s;tay another night in her hou&s;e. She was informed, &s;he &s;aid, that I had been the cau&s;e of your running away, by filling your head with notions of her de&s;igning to confine you in a convent. She would hear nothing that I could &s;ay in my own defence; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me that very evening.</Q></P>
<P>"I am exce&s;&s;ively &s;orry," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>that you &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o much on my account &mdash;It was indeed very imprudent in me to be &s;o communicative to mi&s;s Woodby, but I could not imagine &s;he was capable of &s;o much treachery.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But how have you been able to conceal your&s;elf &s;o well, mi&s;s, from the enquiries of all your friends?</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. White.
<Q>Mr. Bale, it &s;eems, your guardian's &s;on, knew not where to find you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Did Mr. Bale &s;ay he knew not where I was?</Q>
cried mi&s;s Courteney, in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"He told Mr. Danvers &s;o," replied Mrs. White,
<Q>who went &s;everal times by my lady's orders to enquire for you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Was there ever &s;uch complicated trea|chery!</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta, looking at Mrs. Willis with tears in her eyes.
<Q>Well, my
<PB N="8" REF="15">
dear,</Q>
&s;aid the good woman,
<Q>there is at lea&s;t this advantage in misfortunes, that they bring us at la&s;t to wi&s;dom. You will for the future be more cautious how you engage in &s;uch perilous enterprizes.</Q></P>
<P>"Ay, mi&s;s" &s;aid Mrs. White,
<Q>and how you tru&s;t fal&s;e friends to the prejudice of your true ones&mdash;You &s;ee what it has co&s;t me&mdash; but no more of that&mdash; I can forget and for|give.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, and what is now to be done?" &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, folding her hands with a me|lancholy air.</P>
<P>"It is ea&s;y to an&s;wer that que&s;tion," &s;aid Mrs. Willis;
<Q>you mu&s;t write to your aunt, my dear, and give her an account of all that has happened to you. There is certainly &s;omething to condemn in what you have done; but in what you have &s;uffered, there is much to be pitied. I am per&s;uaded her ten|derne&s;s will &s;ilence her re&s;entment. I hoped to have left you with your aunt, mi&s;s,</Q>
con|tinued Mrs. Willis;
<Q>but &s;ince that cannot be, you will return with me, I &s;uppo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"To be &s;ure I will," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>with whom in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation can I be &s;o happy as with you?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16">Mrs. White de&s;ired &s;he might be permitted to come and &s;ee her, to which Henrietta readily con&s;ented; promi&s;ing, if &s;he was reconciled to her aunt, to u&s;e her utmo&s;t endeavours to rein|&s;tate her in her place.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which throws new lights upon Mr. Bale's behaviour, and contains a very improving conver&s;ation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE two ladies being again &s;eated in their po&s;t-chai&s;e, Mrs. Willis kindly applied her&s;elf to comfort her fair companion, who&s;e affecting &s;ilence, &s;hewed a deeper &s;en&s;e of her new di&s;appointment than any words could ex|pre&s;s. However, mi&s;s Courteney felt in reality lower perturbations and le&s;s anxiety in her re|turn, than when &s;he began her journey. So true it is, that when we hope little, we fear little likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>She now looked upon her aunt's affection as irrecoverable; mi&s;s Woodby's vile in&s;inuations had &s;trengthened her &s;u&s;picions: Mr. Bale, when he found him&s;elf detected, would doubt|le&s;s account for his behaviour in a manner un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vourable to her; her unhappy flight had given &s;uch a colour to her &s;ucceeding actions, as ren|dered
<PB N="10" REF="17">
any ju&s;tification of her&s;elf hopele&s;s; and the in&s;idious chaplain might now with ca&s;e con|firm tho&s;e prejudices he had rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this manner &s;he rea&s;oned her&s;elf into a be|lief that her misfortune was irremediable: de&s;pair, as an ingenious writer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The author of maxims, characters, and reflections, etc. Printed for J. and R. Ton&s;on.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, being that ea&s;e to the mind which mortification is to the fle&s;h, Henrietta found &s;ome relief in being freed from that vici&s;&s;itude of hopes and fears which had &s;o long held her mind in the mo&s;t racking &s;u&s;pence; and, with a kind of gloomy &s;atisfaction, re&s;igned her&s;elf to all the bitterne&s;s of her fate.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis, who knew not the peculiarities of lady Meadows's temper, or if &s;he had, would not perhaps have con&s;idered, that ob&s;tinate people are ever mo&s;t ob&s;tinate in error, thought all things might be &s;et right again, by mi&s;s Cour|teney's giving a candid narrative of what had happened to her &s;ince her leaving her; &s;he there|fore pre&s;&s;ed the young lady to delay writing to her aunt no longer than the next day.</P>
<P>"There are &s;ome ca&s;es," &s;aid Mrs. Willis to her, when &s;he &s;aw her &s;itting down to write,
<Q>in which &s;implicity is the greate&s;t refinement of art; yours is one of them: be as &s;imple and
<PB N="11" REF="18">
ingenuous as you can in the account you give your aunt, and let the facts &s;peak for them|&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta followed her advice, and related every part of her conduct &s;ince &s;he had left her, and the treachery and deceit that had been u&s;ed towards her, with the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s and &s;in|cerity, and &s;aw that &s;he had made her letter more affecting by its &s;implicity, than &s;he could have done by the nice&s;t touches of art. Mrs. Willis read it, and approved of it; and it was immediately di&s;patched to the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Scarce was this little affair over, when Mr. Bale &s;ent in his name.</P>
<P>"I like this piece of ceremony," &s;aid Mrs. Willis;
<Q>it looks as if the man was a&s;hamed of what he has done: do you chu&s;e to &s;ee him, mi&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! no," replied Henrietta;
<Q>it would be &s;trange indeed if I was willing to &s;ee a man whom you &s;u&s;pect of having &s;uch &s;hocking de&s;igns, and who I am &s;ure has not acted hone&s;tly.</Q></P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>I will go down to him, and hear what he has to &s;ay.</Q></P>
<P>She returned again in le&s;s than an hour, &s;mil|ing. "This young man," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>does not want &s;en&s;e: what would you &s;ay, mi&s;s,
<PB N="12" REF="19">
if I was to tell you that he has per&s;uaded me he has acted very right, and with the be&s;t in|tentions in the world.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould &s;ay that I am le&s;s unhappy than I thought I was,</Q>
replied mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>for &s;urely it is a great misfortune to meet with per&s;ons who abu&s;e our confidence and the good opinion we have of them.</Q></P>
<P>"That misfortune," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>will in time become &s;o common, that you will feel it le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly than you do now. The only way to avoid being deceived, is to be always upon your guard again&s;t deceit.</Q></P>
<P>"That is to &s;ay I mu&s;t be always &s;u&s;picious," &s;aid Henrietta;
<Q>that may be a very prudent maxim, but my heart di&s;avows it.</Q></P>
<P>"Alas! my dear," replied Mrs. Willis,
<Q>we all enter upon the world with high notions of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, friend&s;hip, &s;incerity, and candor: but experience &s;hows us, that the&s;e qualities exi&s;t not, or among &s;o very few, that it does not fall to the lot of one mortal in a thou&s;and to meet with them in tho&s;e we con|tract friend&s;hips with. The frequent di&s;ap|pointments we &s;uffer in the &s;earch of them, make &s;u&s;picion grow into a habit of think|ing, which if it le&s;&s;ens our enjoyments le&s;&s;ens our inconveniencies likewi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">"Then I," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>&s;hall be always expo&s;ed to inconveniencies; for I am &s;ure I can never bring my&s;elf to &s;u&s;pect per&s;ons who appear de&s;erving of my good opinion: and indeed I think it is more honourable to be often deceived, than to be always doubting.</Q></P>
<P>"But it is not &s;o &s;afe," replied Mrs. Willis, &s;miling:
<Q>however, my dear, in unexperienced youth like yours this way of thinking is meri|torious; the faults of the world can only be learned by a long acquaintance with it, and by &s;uffering from that acquaintance. Tho&s;e who derive this kind of knowledge from the heart rather than the head, are indeed &s;afe them&s;elves, but dangerous to all others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But I will keep you no longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, with regard to Mr. Bale. He has glo&s;&s;ed over his behaviour &s;o as to make me appear &s;atisfied with it, which indeed it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould, if I would not wi&s;h to make an enemy of him; and a very powerful one he might be to my hu&s;band.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He a&s;ked for you as &s;oon as he &s;aw me, and did not &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ed at the very &s;light excu&s;e I made for your not &s;eeing him. He expre&s;&s;ed great concern for the treatment you had re|ceived from his wife; for in her frantic rage it
<PB N="14" REF="21">
&s;eems &s;he told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed between you.</Q></P>
<P>"You find," &s;aid he,
<Q>I did not exaggerate my wife's failing.</Q></P>
<P>"It is a great misfortune," replied I;
<Q>but, &s;ir, I think if you had not made a &s;ecret of your connections with mi&s;s Courteney, Mrs. Bale's jealou&s;y would not have had &s;o plau&s;ible an excu&s;e, nor would the young lady have had any rea&s;on to complain of you.</Q></P>
<P>"I &s;hould have found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible," &s;aid he,
<Q>to have concerned my&s;elf in mi&s;s Cour|teney's affairs, or been of the lea&s;t u&s;e to her, had my wife known any thing of the matter; the very fight of mi&s;s Courteney would have rou&s;ed her &s;u&s;picions, and have put it out of my power to act either as a friend or guardian by her; and, in her unhappy &s;ituation, &s;he had great need of my care and attention.</Q></P>
<P>"However, &s;ir," replied I,
<Q>it was cer|tainly ill judged to conceal from mi&s;s Cour|teney, that you was married: what mu&s;t &s;he think of &s;uch a &s;trange conduct?</Q></P>
<P>"Why, Mrs. Willis," re&s;umed he,
<Q>I have already told you, that I could not own my mar|riage to mi&s;s Courteney, without letting her into my rea&s;ons for not being able to offer her an a&s;ylum in my hou&s;e, during her aunt's di&s;|plea&s;ure,
<PB N="15" REF="22">
an offer &s;he had great rea&s;on to ex|pect. I was unwilling to expo&s;e my wife's foible, and to rai&s;e &s;cruples in the young lady's mind, which might prevent her from receiving tho&s;e little &s;ervices from me which &s;he had &s;o much need of: I hope you will re|pre&s;ent all this to her, and let her know how greatly I am afflicted at what &s;he has &s;uf|fered.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To be &s;ure I will, replied I; but mi&s;s Cour|teney tells me you have received letters from Mr. Bale, in which he acquaints you that there are &s;ome foreign merchants coming to re|&s;ide in my hou&s;e; and that &s;he was to be re|moved for that rea&s;on. I &s;urpri&s;ed her greatly, by &s;aying I had heard nothing of it; and, in|deed I am a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed my&s;elf at it.</Q></P>
<P>"Why, to be plain with you, Mrs. Willis," &s;aid the young gentleman,
<Q>this was only an invention.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid I, looking very grave:
<Q>to be &s;ure you had &s;ome good rea&s;on for it.</Q></P>
<P>"Doubtle&s;s I had," pur&s;ued he,
<Q>and you your&s;elf &s;hall be judge of my rea&s;on.&mdash;This is a bad world, Mrs. Willis, a very bad world: nothing but &s;tratagems and de&s;igns, fraud and cunning. Our &s;ex, Mrs. Willis, is in a &s;tate of war with yours, our arms are &s;ighs and
<PB N="16" REF="23">
vows, and flattery and prote&s;tation, and (as in all other warfares) we fight to de&s;troy.</Q></P>
<P>"Ble&s;s us," interrupted Henrietta, half &s;mil|ing, "what could this fine preface lead to?"</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t," re&s;umed Mrs. Willis laughing,
<Q>it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty I compo&s;ed my countenance to a look of grave attention; while he uttered all this with a &s;olemn accent, and an air of infinite importance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Truly &s;ir, replied I, for &s;o young a gentle|man you think very gravely of the&s;e matters: it is highly commendable in one of your years.</Q></P>
<P>"Heaven forbid, Mrs. Willis," &s;aid he,
<Q>that all men &s;hould be libertines; but in &s;hort it was to pre&s;erve mi&s;s Courteney from falling into the &s;nares of one, that I formed an ex|cu&s;e for &s;ending her into the country.</Q></P>
<P>"Vile di&s;&s;embler!" exclaimed mi&s;s Courteney again, glowing with indignation;
<Q>pre&s;erve me from falling into the &s;nares of a libertine! I hope my own di&s;cretion, without any aid from him, was &s;ufficient to guard me again&s;t any &s;nares that a libertine could lay for me.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope &s;o too," &s;aid Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>Henrietta blu&s;hed a little at this expre&s;&s;ion, which &s;eemed, &s;he thought, to imply a doubt, but would not interrupt Mrs. Willis again.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">
<Q>I told you that this gentleman was very art|ful,</Q>
continued the good woman,
<Q>as you will be convinced by the &s;tory he told.</Q></P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know," &s;aid he to me, looking extremely wi&s;e, and lowering his voice,
<Q>that when I waited upon mi&s;s Courteney at the lodgings &s;he had taken after &s;he left her aunt, I ob&s;erved a fine gay young man there, who followed me when I went out, and looked at me in a manner that &s;hewed great curio&s;ity and attention. It came into my head that this might be the &s;park of whom mi&s;s Cour|teney's aunt was apprehen&s;ive: I di&s;covered that he lodged in the hou&s;e with the young lady; and this circum&s;tance I liked by no means. I re&s;olved to remove her immedi|ately, and place her with you: &s;he &s;o readily con&s;ented to my propo&s;al that I doubted whe|ther I had not been extremely mi&s;taken in my conjectures concerning this young gentle|man; but a day or two after &s;he was &s;ettled with you, my &s;park came to enquire for her at my hou&s;e: now it was plain that mi&s;s Courteney held &s;ome corre&s;pondence with him, otherwi&s;e he could not have known where to come after her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I happened not to be at home, and the &s;ervants told him, that no &s;uch per&s;on was
<PB N="18" REF="25">
there. He came &s;everal times, and was al|ways an&s;wered in the &s;ame manner. His enquiries at length reached the ears of my wife; &s;he de&s;ired he might be &s;hewn up to her apartment when he came next; and it was from him that &s;he learned mi&s;s Courteney was under my care.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To one of her temper it was enough to know that I had the management of a lady's affairs, to make her &s;u&s;pect that I had a more than ordinary intere&s;t in the lady her&s;elf. But &s;he concealed her thoughts from me: and I, who was wholly ignorant that this gentle|man had &s;een my wife, was only concerned at the connexion there &s;eemed to be between mi&s;s Courteney and him; and therefore fixed upon that &s;tratagem, to remove her out of his reach without giving her any &s;u&s;picions of the cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have &s;ince enquired about the gentleman; and I hear that he is a man of quality, and that he is &s;hortly to be married to a great for|tune. Judge now whether his de&s;igns on mi&s;s Courteney could be honourable&punc; and whe+ther I had not rea&s;on to act as I did with re+gard to &s;ending her away?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="26">"And now, my dear," added Mrs. Willis, &s;miling,
<Q>did you ever hear a more plau&s;ible tale?</Q></P>
<P>"I have &s;omewhere read it ob&s;erved," re|plied Henrietta,
<Q>that we are better deceived by having &s;ome truth told us than none. Mr. Bale has put this maxim in practice; his tale is plau&s;ible, becau&s;e part of it is true: but his inferences are all fal&s;e; and their cau&s;e lies too deep for me to di&s;cover it.</Q></P>
<P>She then related &s;uccinctly all that had pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Eccles, and that &s;he had earne&s;tly intreated Mr. Bale to di&s;po&s;e of her el&s;ewhere, being re&s;olved, after the affront that had been offered to her, to remain there no longer. She added, that the young lord hav|ing hinted his &s;u&s;picions that Mr. Bale was her lover, &s;he thought her&s;elf obliged to tell him his name, and explain the nature of his con|nexions with her, that &s;he might not, by going away with a per&s;on unknown, leave room for calumny to &s;lander her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis was charmed with this candid account of her conduct, which overthrew all Mr. Bale's in&s;inuations. She embraced her with great tenderne&s;s.
<Q>All will &s;oon be &s;et right (&s;aid &s;he) your aunt will receive you
<PB N="20" REF="27">
with redoubled affection.</Q>
Mi&s;s Courteney &s;ighed; but having already taken her re&s;olution, &s;he was prepared for whatever events might happen.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>HENRIETTA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR niece I cannot, after what has hap|pened, call you&mdash; If you had not, by the highe&s;t imprudence that any young woman could be guilty of, given too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">our for the &s;hocking cen&s;ures that are ca&s;t on you, I might perhaps have been deceived by your plau&s;ible account of things.

yet it would be ea&s;y for me to take to pieces every part of your defence, and &s;hew you the ab&s;urdity of it: but this is needle&s;s; for, whe|ther you are innocent or guilty, you have greatly wounded your reputation, and I can no longer with honour con&s;ider you or treat you as my niece.</P>
<P>There is but one way left by which you can retrieve your fame and my affection; motives which ought to have &s;ome weight with you, but infinitely le&s;s than the de&s;ire of &s;ecuring your &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I hoped and believed your conver&s;ion was near completed, and doubtle&s;s it would have been, had not your pa&s;&s;ions intervened.</P>
<P>If you will retire to a convent, and put your&s;elf into a way of being in&s;tructed in the true religion, I will pay your pen&s;ion largely; and the day that &s;ees you reunited to the faith, &s;hall &s;ee you re&s;tored to my fonde&s;t affec|tion, and made &s;ole heire&s;s to my whole e&s;tate.

<P><PB N="22" REF="29">Although &s;everal parts of this letter were ex|tremely &s;hocking both to the delicacy and pride of Henrietta, yet the &s;hining bribe that was of|fered her to procure her apo&s;ta&s;y, made a large compen&s;ation. She had now an opportunity given her of making a worthy &s;acrifice to the religion &s;he believed and profe&s;&s;ed; a circum|&s;tance that exalted her in her own opinion: for her &s;elf-love had been deeply wounded by the humiliations &s;he had undergone; and as great delicacy always &s;uffers mo&s;t, &s;o it enjoys mo&s;t from its own reflection.</P>
<P>She was not free from a little enthu&s;ia&s;m that told her it was glorious to &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of religion, nor &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted as not to feel great plea&s;ure in the thought of being able to free her moral character from injurious &s;u&s;picions, by &s;o firm an attachment to her religious prin|ciples.</P>

<P>"Read this," &s;aid Henrietta, giving her the letter &s;he had written; I am &s;ure you will not "di&s;approve of what I have done." Mrs. Willis read it eagerly, and found it as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a great grief to me to find that your affection is irrecoverable, for at the price you have &s;et upon it, I mu&s;t ever deem it &s;o.

<P>That poverty, which happily is become my choice, will be my be&s;t vindication; and if it affords me no other ble&s;&s;ing but that of a good con&s;cience, it will be&s;tow on me the highe&s;t that is attainable in this life, and which will enable me to bear chearfully all the mi&s;|fortunes that may befal me; among which I &s;hall always look upon the lo&s;s of your e&s;teem

</LETTER>
<P><Q>I mu&s;t approve, nay admire your re&s;olu|tion, mi&s;s,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Willis, returning the letter;
<Q>and if you per&s;i&s;t in it, you will ap|pear to me a wonder.</Q></P>
<P>"Do you doubt my per&s;i&s;ting in it?" replied Henrietta.</P>
<P>"When I con&s;ider," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>your birth, your youth, your beauty, and the ex|pectations you have been encouraged to enter|tain, I know it mu&s;t co&s;t you a great deal to throw away the advantages that are offered you, and which po&s;&s;ibly you might &s;ecure by tempori&s;ing at lea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>"Di&s;&s;imulation," interrupted Henrietta,
<Q>on any occa&s;ion, is mean and &s;candalous; but in matters of religion it is &s;urely a heinous crime; and I hope I am far enough from committing it; but I own I have many mo|tives to &s;timulate my re&s;olution.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My own imprudence, and the treachery of others, have given a wound to my reputa|tion, which a voluntary poverty can only re|pair.
<PB N="25" REF="32">
In this licentious age, &s;he, who with youth and even the &s;lighte&s;t advantages of per&s;on, dares to be poor, de&s;erves &s;urely to be thought virtuous; and I &s;hall ever acknowledge the bounty of Providence, that, amid&s;t the un|ju&s;t cen&s;ures which have been ca&s;t on me, has made an humble lot my choice.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;atisfied," interrupted Mrs. Willis:
<Q>rea&s;on, I &s;ee, has a greater &s;hare in your &s;o lately formed re&s;olution, than the zeal of en|thu&s;ia&s;m, or the &s;ugge&s;tions of vanity; and you may believe me a true friend to your fame, when I heartily congratulate you on your pre|&s;ent &s;ituation. And now, my dear mi&s;s, &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you of my tendere&s;t friend|&s;hip; a friend&s;hip which cannot be contented with bare profe&s;&s;ions, and in&s;i&s;ts upon your putting it to &s;ome trial.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tell me how I can &s;erve you? O! that you would honour me &s;o far as to let this hou&s;e be your a&s;ylum till fortune does ju&s;tice to your merit. Conde&s;cend to live with me, my dear mi&s;s, and &s;hare my little income.</Q></P>
<P>"You are very kind, dear Mrs. Willis," re|plied Henrietta;
<Q>but my circum&s;tances will not permit me to continue your boarder, and no di&s;tre&s;s &s;hall oblige me to be burthen&s;ome to a friend. I have already re&s;olved how to

di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf, and, in the &s;cheme I have formed, I &s;hall need your a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P>"Tell me, my dear," cried Mrs. Willis, eagerly, "how I can be of any u&s;e to you?"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t," replied Henrietta, blu&s;hing a little:
<Q>you mu&s;t get me a &s;ervice, my dear Mrs. Willis.</Q></P>
<P>"A &s;ervice!" exclaimed the good woman.</P>
<P>"I am very well qualified," re&s;umed Hen|rietta, recovering from her fir&s;t confu&s;ion, and &s;miling,
<Q>to wait upon a woman of fa&s;hion: for my mother gave me a u&s;eful as well as genteel education; and this &s;tation will be at once private enough to &s;ecure me from di&s;|agreeable accidents, and publick enough to make my conduct acquit or condemn me.</Q></P>
<P>"I will not," added &s;he, ob&s;erving Mrs. Willis continued &s;ilent,
<Q>offer my&s;elf to any place by my own name; that would look like an in&s;ult upon my great relations, and be perhaps an ob&s;truction to my &s;ucce&s;s. It is &s;ufficient for me, that whenever I am di&s;co|vered, it may be in circum&s;tances at which they, not I, need be a&s;hamed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When I fir&s;t heard you mention this &s;cheme,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>I thought I could never be brought to approve it; but a little reflection has convinced me that it may
<PB N="27" REF="34">
have good con&s;equences. You cannot be long concealed; that graceful form will &s;oon draw notice upon you. Whenever you are known to be in a &s;tation &s;o unworthy your birth and merit, the pride of your relations will be rouzed. How glorious then will this humiliation be for you! Methinks I &s;ee their confu&s;ion for their neglect of you, and their eagerne&s;s to repair it, by re&s;toring you to the rank you was born in&mdash; Oh! my dear, you will certainly be happy yet, I am &s;ure you will.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta &s;miled a little at the good woman's &s;anguine expectations; but in reality, the &s;ame thoughts had made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon her, and contributed, more than &s;he imagined, to allay the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he felt at being reduced to take &s;uch a &s;tep. By degrees &s;he formed in her own mind &s;o romantick a &s;cene, that &s;he grew impatient to enter upon it, and again intreated the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>The good woman telling her that a cou&s;in of her hu&s;band's was a &s;ack-maker, and in great vogue at the court end of the town, it was agreed that &s;he &s;hould go to her, and en|gage her good offices towards recommending the young lady to a place; it being very likely that

<P>MRS. Willis &s;ucceeded beyond her hopes; the mantua-maker had been de&s;ired by a lady &s;he worked for, to look out for a genteel young per&s;on to &s;erve her in the quality of her woman; and promi&s;ed her cou&s;in, that &s;he would mention her friend to the lady the next day, being to wait on her with &s;ome cloaths that were to be tried on. She added, that the lady was a citizen, but had an immen&s;e for|tune, and that her place was certainly a very good one.</P>
<P>Henrietta &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed with her landlady's &s;ucce&s;s, though &s;he was not free from &s;ome unea&s;y perturbations at the thoughts of the condition &s;he was &s;o &s;oon to enter upon.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mea&s;ure did not fail to vi&s;it her cou&s;in the next day.
<Q>Well (&s;aid &s;he) I have done the young gentlewoman's bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;he has
<PB N="29" REF="36">
nothing to do but to wait upon mi&s;s Cord|wain; and, if &s;he likes her figure, &s;he will hire her directly.</Q></P>
<P>"Why, pray," replied Mrs. Willis,
<Q>what kind of figure will be&s;t plea&s;e this lady?</Q></P>
<P>"Oh!" cried Mrs. Mea&s;ure,
<Q>mi&s;s Cord|wain's woman mu&s;t be very genteel, and look like a gentlewoman; the richer &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed too, when &s;he goes to wait on her, the better. Every thing about mi&s;s Cordwain mu&s;t be magnificent. Well,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, laughing, and taking a pinch of &s;nuff, which produced &s;everal little pau&s;es in her di&s;cour&s;e,
<Q>it is really &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the&s;e little cits, how they mimick people of quality&mdash;They mu&s;t be &s;o extravagantly in the fa&s;hion&mdash;I vow and prote&s;t the negligee I tried on mi&s;s Cordwain to-day, had a train three yards and a half long.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta that moment entering the room, Mrs. Willis, &s;eeing her cou&s;in was &s;urpri&s;ed at her appearance, &s;aid, this is the young gentle|woman who wants a place.</P>
<P>The mantua-maker, upon this information, re&s;umed her familiar look and manner; and, throwing her&s;elf again upon her chair, took a full &s;urvey of the young lady, who thanked her, with &s;ome he&s;itation, and a blu&s;h that crim|&s;oned
<PB N="30" REF="37">
over her face, for the &s;ervice &s;he had done her.</P>
<P>"I have ju&s;t been telling my cou&s;in," &s;aid Mrs. Mea&s;ure,
<Q>that mi&s;s Cordwain, the lady I have recommended you to, ma'am, is very hard to be plea&s;ed. Her woman mu&s;t look like a lady for&s;ooth: &s;he has refu&s;ed three that went to &s;ee her place; one, becau&s;e &s;he had a red hand; it looked, &s;he &s;aid, as if the creature had &s;tood at a wa&s;h-tub; another, becau&s;e &s;he went to be hired in a linen gown; and the third, becau&s;e &s;he had lived with no|body of higher rank than a baronet's wife&mdash; But I am &s;ure &s;he can have no objection to you, ma'am, unle&s;s perhaps &s;he may think you too hand&s;ome. Do you take &s;nuff, ma'am?</Q>
offering her box, which Henrietta civilly declined.</P>
<P>"But dear ma'am," pur&s;ued the mantua-maker,
<Q>who makes your cloaths? I never &s;aw any thing &s;o frightful as the &s;lope of that ruffle, then &s;uch a horrid &s;leeve: it is well, you are naturally genteel.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta &s;lightly bowed in return for this compliment; and a&s;ked her, at what hour it would be proper to wait upon mi&s;s Cord|wain?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="38">"About one o'clock in the forenoon," re|plied Mrs. Mea&s;ure,
<Q>that's her breakfa&s;t time. Her father, hone&s;t man, is in his warehou&s;e before &s;ix. But this is his only daughter; and he expects &s;he will be a duche&s;s, or counte&s;s at lea&s;t&mdash; She has fifty thou&s;and pounds.</Q></P>
<P>"Where does the lady live?" a&s;ked Henrietta.</P>
<P>"Here in one of your filthy lanes," replied the mantua-maker;
<Q>I forget the name of it, but every body knows Mr. Cordwain the packer.</Q></P>
<P>She then ro&s;e up, made one of her be&s;t cour|te&s;ies, and hurried into a chair that was waiting for her; for this polite mantua-maker was above vi&s;iting her cu&s;tomers in a hackney coach: and this in&s;olence was &s;uch a proof of her excellence in her bu&s;ine&s;s, that few ever &s;crupled to pay for it.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which &s;hews Henrietta in a new &s;ituation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta having &s;ummoned all her re&s;olu|tion, that &s;he might acquit her&s;elf with propriety of the ta&s;k &s;he had undertaken, pre|pared the next day to wait upon mi&s;s Cordwain. She remembered the mantua-maker's hint, and therefore avoided any &s;tudied &s;implicity in her dre&s;s; but no apparel, however mean, could have hid that noble air, or di&s;gui&s;ed that na|tive elegance, &s;o con&s;picuous throughout her whole per&s;on.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was ready, &s;he &s;tepped in to Mrs. Willis's parlour, and, while a coach was &s;ent for, a&s;&s;umed a more than ordinary chear|fulne&s;s in her di&s;cour&s;e with the good woman; for &s;he was extremely de&s;irous of concealing the emotions &s;he felt upon this mortifying occa&s;ion, and affected a mo&s;t heroick indifference, while inly &s;he &s;uffered all that a mind, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cate and &s;en&s;ible as her's, could feel.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis followed her to the door with tears in her eyes. The young lady &s;tepped into the coach, &s;miled a farewel, and ordered
<PB N="33" REF="40">
the coachman to drive to Mr. Cordwain's. A few minutes brought her to the hou&s;e; and the &s;ervant, of whom &s;he enquired if mi&s;s Cordwain was at home, having &s;hewn her into a parlour, bowed and withdrew.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain being informed that a lady enquired for her, ordered her admittance; and the &s;ame &s;ervant returning, conducted Henrietta to her dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain, who was &s;till lingering over her tea-table with a female acquaintance, ro&s;e up at Henrietta's graceful entrance, and, re|ceiving her with a low courte&s;y, offered her an arm-chair at the upper-end of the room.</P>
<P>Henrietta, con&s;cious of the error &s;he had committed in not making u&s;e of the mantua-maker's name before, blu&s;hed a little at this reception, which was not &s;uitable to the cha|racter &s;he was to appear in, and, declining the chair; "Mrs. Mea&s;ure, madam," &s;aid &s;he. She could utter no more than tho&s;e two words; but they were &s;ufficient to give mi&s;s Cordwain to under&s;tand her bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The haughty citizen was exce&s;&s;ively &s;hocked to find &s;he had been betrayed by the figure of Henrietta into &s;o improper an in&s;tance of re&s;pect; and that the per&s;on &s;he took for a lady of di&s;|tinction was the young woman who had been
<PB N="34" REF="41">
recommended to her &s;ervice, thought to recover the dignity which &s;he conceived &s;he had lo&s;t from this mi&s;take, by a&s;&s;uming an imperious air and an in&s;olent accent.</P>
<P>"Who did you live with la&s;t?" &s;aid &s;he to Henrietta, throwing her&s;elf again into her chair, and glancing her over with a &s;upercilious eye;
<Q>I hope it was with a woman of quality: you will not do for me, I can tell you, if you have not been u&s;ed to attend upon per&s;ons of rank.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, notwith&s;tanding the confu&s;ion &s;he was under at acting &s;o &s;trange a part, could not help being diverted with the pride of this daugh|ter of trade.</P>
<P>"I am afraid, madam," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>I &s;hall not be worthy of your place; for I never lived in the &s;ervice of any woman of quality, nor indeed in any other.</Q></P>
<P>"What you are a gentlewoman, I &s;uppo&s;e," interrupted mi&s;s Cordwain, drawling out the word <HI>gentlewoman</HI>;
<Q>and now I remember Mea&s;ure told me you had never been in &s;er|vice. Well, that does not &s;ignify: I have no objection to your having been a gentlewoman; you may be the better &s;ervant for what I know. For to &s;ay the truth,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to her companion,
<Q>tho&s;e &s;ort of poor
<PB N="35" REF="42">
gentlewomen, when they are reduced, as they call it, to wait upon us, who could buy their whole generation, often know their di&s;tance better, and are more humble than &s;uch as have been bred to &s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P>Oh!" &s;aid the other lady, with an applauding &s;mile,
<Q>ever while you live, madam, chu&s;e a gentlewoman for your maid. There is alder|man Fig the grocer's lady: I have heard He often declare &s;he never was &s;o well &s;erved as when colonel Noble's daughter waited on her. The colonel was killed in the la&s;t war; and, as tho&s;e folks you know have &s;eldom any thing to leave their families, his fine gay daughters were obliged to go to &s;ervice after his death, and did very well; but &s;ome body left them ten thou&s;and pounds a piece, and &s;poiled two excellent &s;ervants, by making them gentle|women again.</Q></P>
<P>"Nay, if they had fortunes left them," re|plied mi&s;s Cordwain, "why you know, then, "they had a right to be called gentlewomen.</P>
<P>"Well, child," pur&s;ued &s;he, turning to Henrietta,
<Q>as I told you before I have no ob|jection to your having been a gentlewoman; for I am re&s;olved never to have any other to wait on me: I &s;hall take you upon Mea&s;ure's
<PB N="36" REF="43">
recommendation, and the &s;ooner you come the better.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, who had really enjoyed the con|ver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two la|dies, told her that &s;he would come whenever &s;he plea&s;ed; and it being agreed &s;he &s;hould come the following day, that &s;he might dre&s;s her new lady for a city-fea&s;t, &s;he courte&s;ied profoundly low, and withdrew.</P>
<P>Henrietta, who&s;e imagination was naturally lively, and not wholly free from tho&s;e romantic notions which per&s;ons of her age readily admit, began to con&s;ider her transformation from the niece of lady Meadows, and a pre&s;umptive heire&s;s, into the waiting-maid of a cit, as one of tho&s;e caprices of fate which never fail to pro|duce &s;urpri&s;ing effects. She could not help fan|cying her&s;elf the future heroine of &s;ome affect|ing tale, who&s;e life would be varied with &s;ur|pri&s;ing vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune; and that &s;he would at la&s;t be rai&s;ed to a rank as much above her hopes, as the &s;tation &s;he was now entering upon was below all that her fears had ever &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>But the&s;e reflections were &s;ucceeded by others more rea&s;onable, and which indeed afforded her a more &s;olid &s;atisfaction: &s;he was going to re|fute the cen&s;ures of an injurious world; to make that innocence which had been &s;o vilely tra|duced
<PB N="37" REF="44">
manife&s;t, in her chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to poverty and &s;ervitude, at a time when a &s;hining fortune was offered to purcha&s;e a change in her religious principles, and when perhaps a little di&s;&s;imulation, or a temporary compliance with her aunt's propo&s;als, might re&s;tore her to a rank in life &s;uitable to her birth.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction &s;he felt from the&s;e plea&s;ing ideas, diffu&s;ed &s;uch a &s;erenity over her fair face, as agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed Mrs. Willis, who had waited her return with impatience.</P>
<P>Henrietta repeated to her the dialogue that had pa&s;&s;ed between the two ladies with &s;o much humour, and marked the pride of wealth, and aukward affectation of grandeur and di&s;tinction, in the&s;e opulent heire&s;&s;es to the laborious gains of &s;ordid thrift, and perhaps &s;ucce&s;sful knavery, with &s;uch delicate &s;trokes of &s;atire as convinced Mrs. Willis &s;he would not be an injudicious ob|&s;erver of the manners of tho&s;e whom it might be her lot to a&s;&s;ociate with, nor pa&s;s through this new &s;cene of life, without drawing improve|ment from it.</P>
<P>The good woman was grieved to find that &s;he mu&s;t lo&s;e her &s;o &s;oon; but, being fully per|&s;uaded that this humiliating &s;tep would termi|nate in &s;omething happy for her fair friend, &s;he di&s;po&s;ed her&s;elf to part with her chearfully.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45">It was agreed between them, that the elder Mr. Bale &s;hould not be made acquainted with any part of his &s;on's behaviour with regard to Henrietta, till his return from Holland, when the whole affair might be laid candidly before him; and that the younger &s;hould be told, that &s;he was gone into &s;ervice; but where, he was not to be informed.</P>
<P>The next day Henrietta, after taking a tender farewel of Mrs. Willis, repaired to her new dwelling. Mi&s;s Cordwain was ju&s;t gone out to make &s;ome little purcha&s;es for the evening; and Henrietta, being directed to go into her lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room, was met by her predece&s;&s;or, who had lingered in the hou&s;e to have an opportunity of &s;peaking to her, that, according to the ge|neral cu&s;tom of &s;ervants, &s;he might prejudice her again&s;t her new mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>From this girl, who was not &s;paring in her invectives, &s;he learned that mi&s;s Cordwain's temper, which was not naturally good, was ex|tremely &s;owered of late by a di&s;appointment in love; that the packer, her father, had been treating with a certain nobleman for a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h be|tween her and the nobleman's elde&s;t &s;on; but that it had been broke off, becau&s;e the citizen had refu&s;ed to lay down more than thirty thou|&s;and
<PB N="39" REF="46">
pounds with his daughter, and the noble|man in&s;i&s;ted upon forty.</P>
<P>This little piece of hi&s;tory was followed by a thou&s;and other family anecdotes; to all which Henrietta li&s;tened in &s;ilence, and was not &s;orry that the cen&s;orious waiting-woman, who&s;e tongue had, during a whole hour, run with &s;ur|pri&s;ing volubility, was at length &s;ilenced by the arrival of mi&s;s Cordwain; who&s;e voice when &s;he heard on the &s;tairs, &s;he took a ha&s;ty leave, and retreated thro' a different door from that which the lady entered.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw Hen|rietta, &s;lightly inclined her head, in return to her re&s;pectful courte&s;y; and throwing &s;ome mil|lenary trifles upon her toilet, &s;he &s;at down to her gla&s;s, and ordered her new woman to comb her hair, &s;hewing a fretful impatience at her hair|dre&s;&s;er's long delay; for &s;he was to meet her company at nine o'clock, and it was now almo&s;t four: &s;o that &s;he had good rea&s;on to fear &s;he &s;hould hardly have time enough to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>While Henrietta was acquitting her&s;elf han|dily enough of this task, her lady took up a col|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ection of &s;ongs that lay upon her table, that &s;he might improve her mind while her body was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dorning; and after reading intently a few mo|ments
<PB N="40" REF="47">
to her&s;elf, &s;he ha&s;tily turned over the leaves to a place that was doubled down, and began to read aloud a mo&s;t piteous complaint of a de&s;pairing nymph, who&s;e lover had for&s;aken her for another: &s;he concluded this doleful ditty with a deep &s;igh; and repeating the burden of it, <HI>for men are as fal&s;e as the changeable wind,</HI> "Henrietta," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>was you ever in love?</Q></P>
<P>Our fair heroine, who under&s;tood this que&s;|tion as a prelude to a confidence from her mi&s;tre&s;s, was at &s;ome lo&s;s how to an&s;wer it, when &s;he was relieved from her perplexity by the ar|rival of mon&s;ieur Fine&s;&s;e, the French hair-cutter.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain, immediately dropping her tender langui&s;hments, a&s;&s;umed a &s;upercilious air; and, after haughtily interrogating the inge|nious arti&s;t for not coming &s;ooner, &s;ubmitted her tre&s;&s;es to his forming hands, a &s;ettled gloom all the time clouding her face: for whether it was that her gla&s;s, on which her eyes were intently fixed, told her &s;ome unplea&s;ing truths, or that her gentle bo&s;om heaved with &s;ome &s;ecret di&s;|content, but it is certain that every thing di&s;|plea&s;ed her; nor could all Henrietta's obliging attention to the adorning her per&s;on draw a &s;mile of approbation from her.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48">After five hours labour, however, the lady was completely dre&s;&s;ed. Her father, who had not &s;een her &s;ince dinner, which &s;he had &s;wallowed in ha&s;te, having &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s on her hands, now entered the room; and liking the &s;hewy appearance &s;he made, "Why, Jenny," &s;aid he, "you are as fine as a duche&s;s."</P>
<P>"As fine as a duche&s;s," repeated &s;he, pout|ing; "and why not?"</P>
<P>"Very true, girl," replied the father,
<Q>thou ha&s;t that which can make duche&s;&s;es: but, Jenny, I have &s;omething to &s;ay to thee in pri|vate; &s;o &s;end your waiting-maid away.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta immediately retired into her mi&s;|tre&s;s's bedchamber; which being only &s;eparated from the dre&s;&s;ing-room by a &s;light partition of wain&s;cot, &s;he could not avoid hearing every thing that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q>I have had a propo&s;al made me this after|noon,</Q>
re&s;umed the father,
<Q>and I came to acquaint you with it. Mr. Traffick has a&s;ked you in marriage; there's immen&s;e riches for you, girl: what &s;ay you?</Q></P>
<P>"Sure, papa," cried mi&s;s Cordwain ha&s;tily,
<Q>you have not given him any encouragement, have you? A fine match, indeed! &s;o I mu&s;t be called plain Mrs. Traffick all my days, and there's mi&s;s Fig married to a vi&s;count,
<PB N="42" REF="49">
and has coronets upon her coach: three weeks ago, mi&s;s Haggle, the broker's daughter, became a counte&s;s; and but this very morn|ing I heard that the duke of Hazard is court|ing mi&s;s Steam, our neighbour the &s;oapboiler's niece, and &s;he has but twenty thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;I can't bear it; &s;o, I can't,</Q>
pur|&s;ued mi&s;s Cordwain, bur&s;ting into tears,
<Q>to &s;ee all my comrades at Hackney boarding-&s;chool married to right honourables, and I am not likely to be even a paltry baronet's wife.</Q></P>
<P>Here her tears and &s;obs &s;uppre&s;&s;ed any far|ther utterance, and had &s;uch an effect upon the fond father, that he al&s;o was ready to cry.</P>
<P>"Don't break my heart, Jenny," &s;aid he, half &s;obbing;
<Q>you know it is death to me to &s;ee you fret and grieve your&s;elf: are you not my only child? is it not for you that I have been toiling and labouring for the&s;e forty years, up early and down late, &s;craping all I can to|gether, gaining much and &s;pending little, and all to make you a peere&s;s of Great Britain, and a peere&s;s you &s;hall be; &s;o don't cry, my girl, and &s;poil your complexion; neither neigh|bour Fig, nor neighbour Haggle's daughter, &s;hall be greater than you. You &s;hall be a counte&s;s, Jenny, will that content you? I

will lay down the odd ten thou&s;and, that the earl of &mdash; and I quarrelled about, and you &s;hall have his &s;on.</Q></P>
<P>"I am obliged to you, papa," &s;aid mi&s;s Cord|wain; "but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nay," interrupted the father,
<Q>I find nothing will plea&s;e you: you were crying ju&s;t now, becau&s;e you were not a counte&s;s; and when I tell you you that I will part with an|other ten thou&s;and pounds, to make you ea&s;y, you come with your buts.</Q></P>
<P>"Why, &s;uppo&s;e I am a counte&s;s," replied mi&s;s Cordwain,
<Q>will not mi&s;s Steam be a duche&s;s, and take place of me? I can never endure that.</Q></P>
<P>"What &s;ignifies her taking place of you," &s;aid her father,
<Q>the duke's e&s;tate is not half &s;o good as the earl of &mdash;; be&s;ides, you refu&s;ed a duke, you know, and you have often told me that you like lord B&mdash; better than any man in the world, and how have you pined &s;ince the match was broke off!</Q></P>
<P>"Well, I confe&s;s," replied mi&s;s,
<Q>that I do like my lord B&mdash;, and would rather marry him than any duke in the land, pro|vided that little odious thing, mi&s;s Steam, did not marry above me: &s;he to be called her

<P>"Since it is &s;o," &s;aid the father,
<Q>I &s;hall lay a&s;ide my de&s;ign, and make no advances to the earl.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And then his &s;on will marry &s;ome body el&s;e,</Q>
cried mi&s;s Cordwain.</P>
<P>"What would the girl be at?" interrupted the good man, with &s;ome heat;
<Q>if you won't have him, need you care who has.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain now bur&s;t into a flood of tears: &s;he liked lord B&mdash;, but &s;he could not bear the thoughts of mi&s;s Steam's being in a rank above her; and love and envy rai&s;ed &s;uch tumults in her brea&s;t, as made her &s;eek a relief in tears.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h you knew your own mind, girl," &s;aid the father half angry, and half concerned at her grief.</P>
<P>"I know my own mind well enough," re|plied mi&s;s &s;ullenly:
<Q>I would marry lord B&mdash;, and I would not have that proud <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be a duche&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>"Take my word for it," &s;aid the father,
<Q>&s;he will never be duche&s;s of Hazard; I know her fortune is not &s;ufficient to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r the duke's e&s;tate of two mortgages that have almo&s;t &s;wal|lowed it up.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="52">"Nay, then," interrupted mi&s;s Cordwain, who eagerly admitted an argument that &s;et her mind at ea&s;e,
<Q>I am &s;ure the duke will not have her; for &s;he is &s;o ugly you know, papa, that nothing could charm him but her riches.</Q></P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid the father, &s;miling with plea|&s;ure, to &s;ee her in good humour again,
<Q>I am to meet a friend of the earl's to-night; &s;hall this affair be brought on again?</Q></P>
<P>"As you plea&s;e, papa," &s;aid mi&s;s Cordwain, courte&s;ying;
<Q>you know it is my duty to be obedient.</Q></P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid the good man, ki&s;&s;ing her,
<Q>you have always been one of the mo&s;t dutiful chil|dren in the world; and I will make thee a lady, though I don't leave my&s;elf a &s;hilling.</Q>
With this wi&s;e declaration he quitted the room, leaving his daughter in high &s;pirits; who, after &s;he had called her maid to adju&s;t whatever might be ami&s;s in her dre&s;s, and taken a full &s;urvey of her&s;elf in the gla&s;s, &s;tepped into her coach, with the air of a citizen who had a fortune of forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Contains an incident which the &s;agacious reader has probably fore&s;een.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta, when &s;he was left alone, found &s;ufficient matter for reflection in the &s;enti|ments and behaviour of this wealthy trade&s;man and his daughter; and as it was now become nece&s;&s;ary for her own peace of mind to reconcile her&s;elf to the &s;ituation that fortune had placed her in, &s;he endeavoured to extract u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons from every &s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed under her ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>Why have I lamented my poverty? &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf; riches neither give under&s;tanding to the mind, nor elegance to the per&s;on. How mean is mi&s;s Cordwain with forty thou&s;and pounds! what narrow notions! what &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions! how ignorant, how contemptible!&mdash; All the advantages her large fortune procures her, is a title and a coronet: honours how de&s;picable, when &s;uch as mi&s;s Cordwain wear them!</P>
<P>Let me thank Heaven then, that made my father a younger brother; that he inherited the
<PB N="47" REF="54">
virtues and elevated &s;entiments of his noble an|ce&s;tors, and wanted that allurement to up&s;tart wealth, which might have given me a mi&s;s Cordwain for a mother, and have deprived me of tho&s;e generous precepts, and tho&s;e bright examples, by which I have been taught to think poverty a le&s;s evil than di&s;honour; and that a peaceful con&s;cience is cheaply purcha&s;ed with the lo&s;s of every worldly advantage.</P>
<P>The&s;e were her reflections, as &s;he afterwards declared to her friend. It is not therefore &s;ur|pri&s;ing that with &s;uch &s;entiments, our fair heroine found her&s;elf tranquil in her humble &s;tation, and dignified misfortune by her graceful re&s;ignation to it.</P>
<P>If the woman &s;he &s;erved had had judgment enough to di&s;tingui&s;h merit, and goodne&s;s e|nough to love it, Henrietta mu&s;t have en|gaged her attention and her kindne&s;s: but little minds like nothing but what re&s;embles them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain &s;ometimes conde&s;cended to enter into a conver&s;ation with her woman, but was quickly di&s;gu&s;ted with the difference of their notions; and what &s;he could not compre|hend, &s;he either de&s;pi&s;ed as folly, or &s;u&s;pected as artifice.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">They were upon the&s;e terms when Mr. Cord|wain acquainted his daughter, that they were invited to &s;pend a week at the earl of &mdash;'s country-&s;eat; for the conte&s;ted ten thou&s;and pounds being granted by the citizen, the treaty of marriage was renewed; and this vi&s;it was propo&s;ed in order to bring the young people to|gether again with &s;ome kind of decorum.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain, in high &s;pirits, gave her wo|man notice to make preparations for this little journey; which done, Henrietta went to take leave of her faithful Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>"What a triumph would mine be," &s;aid &s;he to her friend,
<Q>if any of my relations &s;hould happen to be at this nobleman's &s;eat&punc; and be|hold me in the character of mi&s;s Cordwain's &s;ervant!</Q></P>
<P>"You have done right, my dear," replied Mrs. Willis,
<Q>to call it a triumph; for &s;o in|deed it would be, the triumph of virtue over pride and prejudice.</Q></P>
<P>The good woman informed her, that her guardian was in a very ill &s;tate of health, and was gone to Montpelier, in con&s;equence of his phy&s;ician's advice: that the young man had been there to wait upon her; and that when he heard of the re&s;olution &s;he had taken, he af|fected to think him&s;elf extremely injured by her
<PB N="49" REF="56">
conduct, as it &s;hewed the utmo&s;t contempt of his advice and friend&s;hip; but it was ea&s;y to perceive, added Mrs. Willis, that there was more grief than anger in the reproaches he threw out again&s;t you upon this occa&s;ion. He &s;eemed much mortified at my refu&s;ing to tell him where you was, but owned that his wife made him very unea&s;y upon your account; and when I urged that as an argument again&s;t the propriety of your &s;eeing him, his &s;ilence acknow|ledged me in the right.</P>
<P>Henrietta was &s;en&s;ibly affected with the news of her guardian's illne&s;s; and, &s;ince his return was now uncertain, &s;he re&s;olved to write to him immediately, and give him an account of all that had happened to her &s;ince he went abroad, fearing that unle&s;s &s;he explained the rea&s;ons of her conduct, he might be prejudiced again&s;t her by her aunt's repre&s;entations of it.

<P>Mrs. Willis having promi&s;ed to get this letter &s;afely tran&s;mitted to Mr. Bale, Henrietta took a tender leave of her, and returned home.</P>
<P>The next morning very early, the coach and &s;ix was at the door; mi&s;s Cordwain impatiently &s;tepped in, for &s;he thought every moment an

age till &s;he &s;aw her noble lover again. Her face dre&s;&s;ed in &s;miles of plea&s;ing expectation, and her heart exulting with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own worth, which, by her father's conce&s;&s;ion of the di&s;puted thou&s;ands, had received &s;uch a con|&s;iderable addition: but being, as I have before ob&s;erved, not very happy in the frame of her temper, this &s;un-&s;hine of &s;atisfaction was &s;oon clouded at being obliged to wait a few minutes for her father, who&s;e &s;lowne&s;s but ill &s;uited with her eager impatience.</P>
<P>Indeed the wary citizen, having wi&s;ely con|&s;idered that they had a journey to perform of at lea&s;t twenty miles, was bu&s;ied in packing up &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments, that they might not be fami&s;hed by the way. For this purpo&s;e he had cau&s;ed a neat's tongue, a cake of gin|ger-bread, two or three pounds of almonds and rai&s;ins, and a bottle of &s;ack, to be provided; and he him&s;elf brought the ba&s;ket in which they were depo&s;ited to the coach, directing Hen|rietta to get in fir&s;t, that he might place it &s;afely in her lap; which done, he took his &s;eat next his daughter, and ordered the coachman to drive.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain's ill humour in&s;en&s;ibly wear|ing off, they pur&s;ued their journey with great
<PB N="51" REF="58">
&s;atisfaction, not having baited above three or four times on the road.</P>
<P>At length the young lady's eyes were de|lighted with the pro&s;pect of the magnificent villa, which &s;he expected one day to be mi&s;tre&s;s of; but her attention was &s;oon called off that object by the pre&s;ence of her lover, who, being ju&s;t returned from a little excur&s;ion on hor&s;e|back, alighted as &s;oon as he &s;aw the coach &s;top, and advanced to hand his mi&s;tre&s;s out.</P>
<P>The young lord pre&s;ented his hand to mi&s;s Cordwain with an air of forced gallantry; but happening to glance his eyes towards Henrietta, he &s;tarted back in great &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain, vexed at the attention with which he gazed upon her woman, jumped out of the coach, before he had &s;ufficiently reco|vered him&s;elf to be able to offer her again the hand, which, in his confu&s;ion, he had with|drawn.</P>
<P>The lady having on a capuchin, which &s;he had wore during the journey, untied it, and, to&s;&s;ing it into the coach to Henrietta, bid her, in an imperious tone, to take care of it.</P>
<P>This action and the&s;e words gave the young nobleman to under&s;tand that our beauteous he|roine was actually the &s;ervant of mi&s;s Cordwain:
<PB N="52" REF="59">
a circum&s;tance which furni&s;hed him with new matter for wonder; and indeed this encounter gave him &s;o much perplexity, and &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts, that the old trade&s;man (who enquired after my good lord and my good lady's health, with as many bows and &s;crapes as would have &s;erved any trader to expre&s;s his acknowledgment to a cu&s;tomer whom he had ju&s;t impo&s;ed upon) was obliged to repeat his que&s;tions &s;everal times before he could procure an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>As for Henrietta, &s;he had, upon the fir&s;t fight of this young nobleman, whom &s;he im|mediately knew to be the &s;ame per&s;on who lodged at Mrs. Eccles's, been under &s;ome con|fu&s;ion, left he &s;hould acco&s;t her as an acquaint|ance before the lady on whom &s;he attended; but ob&s;erving that from mi&s;s Cordwain's be|haviour, he under&s;tood her &s;ituation, and took no further notice of her than by a &s;ide glance, which he gave her, full of pa&s;&s;ionate concern, &s;he was relieved from her fears, and, far from being di&s;compo&s;ed at the character &s;he appeared in, &s;he acquitted her&s;elf of the little duties of her &s;tation with the mo&s;t graceful ea&s;e; gave her lady her fan, received her commands, and, with a little French trunk in her hand that con|tained
<PB N="53" REF="60">
&s;ome laces and linen, followed her to the hou&s;e at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Lord B&mdash;'s emotions at this unexpected meeting with Henrietta, having now in &s;ome degree &s;ub&s;ided, he entertained his mi&s;tre&s;s as they walked with his u&s;ual vivacity and polite|ne&s;s, but could not help often turning to &s;natch a look of her fair attendant, who&s;e charms in that humble &s;tation, a &s;tation &s;o unworthy of her birth and &s;hining merit, acquired a pathe|tick power that melted him to a tenderne&s;s he had never known before.</P>
<P>He conducted the lady and her father to the apartment of the counte&s;s his mother; and, taking the fir&s;t opportunity to leave them, re|tired to his own, that he might be at liberty to reflect upon his adventure.</P>
<P>To know that the woman, whom all his mo&s;t diligent enquiries for &s;o many weeks could never di&s;cover, was in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, was a circum&s;tance that afforded him infinite &s;atisfaction; but he &s;aw no probabi|lity of turning this circum&s;tance to the ad|vantage of his de&s;igns upon her. For, with what face could he plead his pa&s;&s;ion to one of her delicacy, while he was publickly addre&s;&s;ing another?</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61">The &s;ervile condition he &s;aw her in was a bar to his hopes. She who, with &s;uch un|common attractions, could re&s;olve to be poor, mu&s;t needs be incorruptible. What allure|ment could riches throw out for a woman, who knew no other pride but the pride of virtue?</P>
<P>He could not hope to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon her heart by the di&s;gui&s;e of honourable love. She mu&s;t needs know the terms he was upon with mi&s;s Cordwain; and was afraid that &s;he already de&s;pi&s;ed him for the meanne&s;s of &s;uch a choice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our heroine again appears very fooli&s;h.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MEAN time our lovely heroine, who had been received by the counte&s;s's woman with prodigious ceremony, and had, during a whole hour, li&s;tened with &s;miling attention to all the impertinences &s;he uttered, was at length relieved from the fatigue of &s;uch a conver&s;ation, and, with a profu&s;ion of compliments, con|ducted to a chamber contiguous to that of her mi&s;tre&s;s. As &s;oon as &s;he was left alone, &s;he began to con&s;ider how &s;he &s;hould extricate her|&s;elf from the difficulties her unexpected meeting with lord B&mdash; had involved her in.</P>
<P>Her delicacy was &s;hocked at the thoughts of remaining in the hou&s;e with a man who had made an attempt upon her honour, e&s;pecially in the &s;ituation &s;he now was; a &s;ituation that would &s;eem to invite his future attacks: and, though he might well impute their meeting to the fanta&s;tick effects of chance, yet he would not fail to con&s;true her &s;tay into a tacit encou|ragement of that pa&s;&s;ion he had profe&s;&s;ed for
<PB N="57" REF="64">
her at parting, the di&s;honourable purport of which was evident from the engagements he had entered into with mi&s;s Cordwain.</P>
<P>She reflected al&s;o on the cen&s;ures under which her character laboured at pre&s;ent, and was ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive, that when this part of her &s;tory was known, the malicious world would not fail to in&s;inuate that &s;he threw her&s;elf into lord B&mdash;'s way, and the inferences that would be drawn from &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed conduct, mu&s;t needs be highly di&s;advantageous to her.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, how could &s;he quit mi&s;s Cordwain's &s;ervice &s;o abruptly, without giving occa&s;ion for &s;trange conjectures, and &s;et|ting the tongue of malice loo&s;e to a&s;&s;ign rea|&s;ons for her behaviour, very different from the truth?</P>
<P>However, the inconveniencies, which might attend this &s;tep, were light, compared with tho&s;e &s;he fore&s;aw from expo&s;ing her&s;elf volun|tarily to the pur&s;uits of a young libertine, who&s;e eyes in this la&s;t interview had &s;poke too plainly to leave her in doubt of his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>She therefore re&s;olved to go away the next day; and, as &s;oon as &s;he was &s;ummoned to the toilet, acquainted mi&s;s Cordwain with her in|tention.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65">Henrietta was a &s;crupulous ob&s;erver of truth, and would not on this occa&s;ion violate it, by forming any plau&s;ible excu&s;e for her &s;udden de|termination; &s;o that mi&s;s Cordwain, in who&s;e brea&s;t the &s;tings of jealou&s;y had been rouzed by the pa&s;&s;ionate glances lord B&mdash; had darted at her maid, began to entertain &s;trange &s;u&s;picions from &s;o unexpected an overture; and, in a per|emptory tone, demanded to know her rea&s;ons for quitting her &s;ervice in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>Henrietta, with great &s;weetne&s;s, a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he did not de&s;ire to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in con&s;e|quence of any di&s;content, but that the nece&s;&s;ity of her affairs obliged her to return immediately to town.</P>
<P>"Your affairs!" &s;aid mi&s;s Cordwain, with a haughty &s;neer;
<Q>I vow it is mighty pretty to hear &s;ervants talk of their affairs, as if they really had any concerns of more con&s;equence than the duty they owe their principals. I wonder you don't tell me you have half a dozen engagements in town,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, laughing aloud;
<Q>&s;uch a &s;peech would become you mightily: but prithee, go, creature; pack up your rags in a &s;heet of brown paper, and take your&s;elf away. I &s;uppo&s;e you have found out a new method of living, le&s;s mor|tifying to your pride of beggarly gentility tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="59" REF="66">
waiting upon a woman of fortune; and I doubt not but you will be &s;hortly &s;een flaunt|ing it in publick places with a flim&s;y &s;ack, a painted face, and all the trappings of your trade.</Q></P>
<P>To this coar&s;e abu&s;e Henrietta li&s;tened in &s;ilence, beholding her imperious mi&s;tre&s;s all the time with &s;uch a calm, but &s;teady eye, as called up a blu&s;h in tho&s;e cheeks which had been before over&s;pread with a livid palene&s;s.</P>
<P>Not that &s;he felt any remor&s;e for the re|proaches &s;he had uttered, or was a&s;hamed of her indecent tran&s;ports, but Henrietta's &s;oft compo|&s;ure, the dignity of her &s;ilence, and the ener|getick expre&s;&s;ion in her eyes, &s;truck a kind of awe into her mean-&s;oul'd adver&s;ary; and, inly raging at the inferiority &s;he was con&s;cious of, &s;he commanded her to be gone from her pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Henrietta in&s;tantly obeyed, and, meeting the counte&s;s's woman as &s;he went out of the room, &s;he begged her to &s;end a &s;ervant to the neare&s;t inn to hire a po&s;t-chai&s;e for her, being re&s;olved to return to London that very day.</P>
<P>This well-bred Abigail expre&s;&s;ed great con|cern that &s;he was &s;o &s;oon to lo&s;e the honour of her company; and a&s;ked, with an appearance of anxiety, if &s;he was not to return again?</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67">Henrietta replied in the negative, at which the other &s;eemed wonderfully &s;urpri&s;ed, though &s;he was not ignorant of all that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Henrietta and her lady; for, hearing mi&s;s Cordwain's voice very loud, &s;he had applied her ear to the key-hole, and needed no further information.</P>
<P>Our fair heroine having evaded the artful que&s;tions of this prying woman, and di&s;cou|raged her reflections on her own lady, whom, in her general invective again&s;t the pride and ca|price of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he did not &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, told her, &s;he would have the plea&s;ure of viewing the fine gardens that belonged to the hou&s;e, before &s;he went away; and Mrs. Supple promi&s;ed to join her, as &s;oon as &s;he had executed the commi&s;&s;ion &s;he was charged with.</P>
<P>Henrietta accordingly repaired to the gardens, full of reflections upon the &s;cene that had lately pa&s;&s;ed. She entered a little covered alley that led to a grotto, which &s;he had an inclination to take a view of; when, hearing the &s;ound of &s;teps behind her, &s;he looked back, &s;uppo&s;ing it was Mrs. Supple; but was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find it was lord B&mdash;, who, &s;eeing her cro&s;s the terrace from his chamber-window, had followed her thither.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="68">Henrietta, rightly judging that this encounter was not meerly accidental, turned her &s;teps from the grotto, and &s;truck into a le&s;s private walk. Lord B&mdash;, perceiving her intention, cro&s;&s;ed immediately and met her, bowing pro|foundly low, and, with an air as re&s;pectful as if he was acco&s;ting a duche&s;s, enquired after her health.</P>
<P>Henrietta, not at all flattered by this in&s;tance of re&s;pect, which he, by whom it was paid, con|&s;idered as an act of &s;upererogation, and that it would affect her accordingly, returned his com|pliment with the mo&s;t graceful ea&s;e; and, &s;miling, told him, he mu&s;t not now con&s;ider her as mi&s;s Courteney, but the &s;ervant of mi&s;s Cord|wain.</P>
<P>"O that horrid appellation!" cried he;
<Q>What violence did I not do my&s;elf to behave to you as I did this morning! But tell me, for Heaven's &s;ake, madam, what has occa|&s;ioned this transformation?</Q></P>
<P>"My aunt's continued di&s;plea&s;ure," replied Henrietta;
<Q>your lord&s;hip has perhaps heard what circum&s;tances my father died in: the &s;tation therefore in which you &s;ee me, ought not to be called a transformation; it is what I was born to, &s;ince I was born in in|digence.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69">"I cannot bear to hear you talk thus," inter|rupted lord B&mdash;;
<Q>how could you think of &s;ubjecting your&s;elf to a condition &s;o unworthy of you, when you knew there was a man in the world that would have died to &s;erve you!</Q></P>
<P>"I am not of a temper," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>to be ea&s;y under great obligations; and &s;ervitude is, in my opinion, le&s;s &s;hocking than depen|dence.</Q></P>
<P>"Why, do you talk of obligations," &s;aid lord B&mdash;:
<Q>love knows no property; could you doubt that my fortune would be at your com|mand. Suffer me, I conjure you,</Q>
pur&s;ued he,
<Q>to &s;natch you from this unworthy &s;itua|tion; can riches be better employed, than in &s;upporting her I love?</Q></P>
<P>"My lord," interrupted Henrietta, her face glowing with indignation,
<Q>this is an in&s;ult I could not have expected from one of your rank and politene&s;s: I am fallen very low, indeed, when a man, who is upon the point of marriage with another, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lk to me of love.</Q></P>
<P>"There are certain engagements," replied lord B&mdash;, a little confu&s;ed at the air with which &s;he uttered the&s;e words, "in which the "heart has no part.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="70">"Very likely," interrupted Henrietta;
<Q>but it is &s;ufficient for me to know, that the en|gagements your lord&s;hip has entered into, leaves you not the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing me in this manner: and I look upon the profe&s;&s;ions you make me as the highe&s;t in&s;ult upon my di&s;tre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Lord B&mdash;, notwith&s;tanding he found in this ju&s;tifiable haughtine&s;s the ruin of his hopes, could not help admiring a mind &s;o rightly turned; humble with &s;uch propriety, and proud only, when conde&s;cen&s;ion would be meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>"This is not a time," &s;aid he,
<Q>to tell you how far I am bound by tho&s;e engagements you &s;peak of; but, whatever they are, they ought not to deprive me of the happine&s;s of doing you &s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P>"I am obliged to you, my lord," &s;aid Hen|rietta;
<Q>but, at pre&s;ent, the greate&s;t &s;ervice you can do me is to take no notice of me.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;peaking the&s;e words, &s;he courte&s;ied, and would have left him; but he, not able to part with her thus, &s;natched her hand.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not leave me," &s;aid he,
<Q>till you promi&s;e to give me an opportunity of &s;peaking to you more fully&mdash;Ah, how I love you!</Q>
cried he, gazing on her pa&s;&s;ionately.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="71">"Again, this in&s;ulting declaration!" inter|rupted Henrietta, pulling her hand from him, and giving him a look full of &s;corn and anger, as &s;he turned away.</P>
<P>"Hear me, madam," cried he, pur&s;uing her:
<Q>&s;uffer me, in the character of your friend, to offer you my &s;ervices. My mother was for|merly acquainted with lady Meadows: if it will be of any u&s;e to you, I will engage her to renew it, and offer her mediation betwixt your aunt and you. You mu&s;t not, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> heaven you mu&s;t not, continue longer in &s;o &s;hocking a &s;ituation.</Q></P>
<P>This propo&s;al, and the earne&s;t manner in which it was made, drew Henrietta's attention: angry as &s;he was, &s;he thought it merited a civil return.</P>
<P>"Doubt not my lord," &s;aid &s;he, her charm|ing eyes recovering their u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s,
<Q>that I &s;hould be glad to con&s;ider you in the cha|racter of a friend; and the offer you now make me is &s;o obliging, that I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with my&s;elf from telling you my rea&s;ons for declin|ing it.</Q></P>
<P>She then, in a few words, acquainted him with the purport of her aunt's letter to her "Such are the terms," added &s;he,

<P>Lord B&mdash;, having before fully informed him&s;elf of every thing relating to mi&s;s Courteney, no &s;ooner heard that for &s;o trifling a compliance as the change of her religion it was in her power to &s;ecure lady Meadows' e&s;tate to her&s;elf, which he knew to be very con&s;iderable, than he thought fit to alter his &s;tyle, and declared that the affair between mi&s;s Cordwain and him was not carried &s;o far to take from him the liberty of following his inclinations, and of offering her his hand; be begged her therefore to favour him with another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nterview in the morning, when he would ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ain him&s;elf further.</P>

<P>She left him when &s;he had &s;aid the&s;e few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ords, and went to meet Mrs. Supple, who

<P>Henrietta told her &s;he had not.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MISS Cordwain, who in the notice lord B&mdash; took of Henrietta, found matter &s;ufficient for jealou&s;y and unea&s;ine&s;s, entertained the mo&s;t injurious &s;u&s;picions, when &s;he heard her woman's &s;udden re&s;olution to return to Lon|don; and having driven her from her pre&s;ence with a torrent of abu&s;ive language, vented her rage in tears as &s;oon as &s;he was gone.</P>

<P><PB N="68" REF="75">Mrs. Supple, who was that moment pa&s;&s;ing by her apartment, and knew that Henrietta was not in the way, &s;tepped in to know what &s;he wanted. Mi&s;s Cordwain a&s;ked for her woman, and, being told that &s;he was walking in the garden, ha&s;tened thither immediately, not more delighted with the opportunity &s;he now had of putting a &s;top to her journey, than of affronting her with the &s;u&s;picion of theft.</P>
<P>As &s;he de&s;cended the terrace, her eyes were bla&s;ted with the &s;ight of her woman at a di&s;tance in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with her lover.</P>
<P>At this confirmation of her &s;u&s;picions, &s;he ran back like a fury into the hou&s;e, and meet|ing her father, who had ju&s;t left the earl in his dre&s;&s;ing-room, told him, that they were invited only to be affronted: that Henrietta was lord B&mdash;'s mi&s;tre&s;s; that he had taken her out of her &s;ervice; and that &s;he was going back to London that very night at his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The old man, without &s;taying to enquire farther, or reflecting upon the extreme impro|bability of this &s;tory, &s;wore that never a lord in the land &s;hould u&s;e his daughter ill, and &s;trode back to the earl's apartment, while mi&s;s Cordwain retired to her own, meditating ven+geance on tho&s;e that had &s;o cruelly injured her.</P>

<P>The earl, ob&s;erving that his features were ruffled, was a little &s;urpri&s;ed; but di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his gentleman immediately, though he was not quite dre&s;&s;ed, and then, with a complai&s;ant &s;mile, de&s;ired the citizen to let him know his commands.</P>
<P>"I am a plain man, my lord," &s;aid Mr. Cordwain,
<Q>I don't under&s;tand fine compli|ments and breeding, though I don't want for manners neither; and I am &s;ure I have always been very civil to your lord&s;hip; and I did not expect that your lord&s;hip would have in|vited my girl and I here to &s;coff at us. My lord, I can give my girl forty thou&s;and pounds, which is what few lords can &s;ay, let me tell you that; and withal I am an hone&s;t man, tho' I have forty thou&s;and pounds more in my pocket perhaps: but no matter for that I am not proud of my riches.</Q></P>

Mi&s;s Cordwain is a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young lady, and my &s;on has too much judgment not to be as &s;en&s;ible as he ought of her merits.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed," interrupted Mr. Cordwain,

<Q>I have nothing to &s;ay again&s;t his principles; he is no Jacobite, I dare engage: but he is a rake, my lord, that is my objection to him, and rakes are very bad hu&s;bands.</Q></P>
<P>"My &s;on," &s;aid the peer,

&s;aid the fond father, his eyes gli&s;ten|ing with plea&s;ure.

<P>"She is both beautiful and witty," replied his lord&s;hip, who found every excellence in fifty thou&s;and pounds.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Henrietta has an interview with the counte&s;s.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE counte&s;s, like a di&s;creet matron, was re&s;olved to &s;ee the young woman, of whom mi&s;s Cordwain entertained a jealou&s;y, that &s;he might by whole&s;ome coun&s;els fortify her again&s;t &s;eduction; for &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that this &s;u&s;picion took its ri&s;e from the girl's being pretty, and perhaps &s;ome little unmeaning gallantry of her &s;on's, who, like all other young men, admired beauty whenever he found it.</P>
<P>She was willing al&s;o to know certainly whe|ther mi&s;s Cordwain's fears were only imaginary, that &s;he might the better effect a reconciliation between the lovers; for &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired the completion of a match that would put her &s;on into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Supple appeared in con&s;equence of her &s;ummons, and told her that Mrs. Hen|rietta waited her lady&s;hip's commands, the coun|te&s;s
<PB N="75" REF="82">
a&s;ked her what &s;ort of a young woman &s;he was?</P>
<P>Mrs. Supple replied, that &s;he was an aukward &s;ort of a body, mightily conceited of her beauty &s;he believed; and Heaven knows, added &s;he, &s;he has not much to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>"Well; tell her to come in," &s;aid the coun|te&s;s, beginning to believe, from this account of her, that mi&s;s Cordwain's fears were not without foundation; for vanity, &s;he well knew, was the great underminer of cha&s;tity, from the duche&s;s down to the chamber-maid.</P>
<P>When Henrietta entered the room, the coun|te&s;s, who expected to &s;ee a very different per&s;on, was &s;o &s;truck with her beauty and the dignity of her air, that &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and returned the graceful courte&s;y &s;he made her with a com|plai&s;ance that &s;urpri&s;ed her own woman, who, being ordered by her lady to leave the room, in|&s;tantly obeyed, but went no farther than the door, where &s;he &s;tood li&s;tening, and heard all that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"You appear to me," &s;aid the counte&s;s to Henrietta, with an engaging &s;mile,
<Q>to de&s;erve &s;o little the &s;u&s;picions that are entertained of you, that I really know not how to mention them to you, though it was for that purpo&s;e I &s;ent for you hither.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="83">Henrietta was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at this begin|ning; but con&s;cious of the integrity of all her actions, &s;he was wholly free from any appre|hen&s;ions that could di&s;compo&s;e her.</P>
<P><Q>I know not, madam (&s;aid &s;he) the nature of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions which I have incurred, but I am very &s;ure I have no guilt to reproach my|&s;elf with, which &s;hould make me fear to &s;tand the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny.</Q></P>
<P>"Upon my word I believe you," &s;aid the counte&s;s, charmed with the noble confidence of her an&s;wer, and the graceful manner in which it was delivered;
<Q>and it mu&s;t be my &s;on's im|prudence that has given occa&s;ion for Mr. Cordwain's &s;u&s;picions.</Q></P>
<P>The counte&s;s was too delicate to make u&s;e of mi&s;s Cordwain's name upon this occa&s;ion; but Henrietta in an in&s;tant comprehended the whole my&s;tery, and was now able to account for the injurious language that lady had given her.</P>
<P>"Own freely to me," pur&s;ued the counte&s;s, &s;miling,
<Q>has not my &s;on been a little trouble|&s;ome to you, and talked to you of love and &s;uch idle &s;tuff?</Q></P>
<P>"It is &s;ome mortification to me, madam," replied Henrietta, blu&s;hing,
<Q>to own that I have been affronted in the manner your lady|&s;hip mentions: however it is certainly true,
<PB N="77" REF="84">
lord B&mdash; has thought me weak enough to be dazzled with his profe&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>"Then you have &s;een my &s;on often," &s;aid the counte&s;s.</P>
<P>Henrietta, who thought it behoved her to be very explicit on this occa&s;ion, related to the counte&s;s the manner of her becoming acquainted with lord B&mdash;, his concealing him&s;elf in her chamber, and his behaviour afterwards.</P>
<P>"I did not know his lord&s;hip's name," pur|&s;ued &s;he;
<Q>and though I often heard him men|tioned at Mr. Cordwain's, yet as I had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he was the &s;ame young nobleman, whom I had &s;uch rea&s;on to avoid, I made no &s;cruple to attend mi&s;s Cordwain hither.</Q></P>
<P>"I am very much concerned," &s;aid the coun|te&s;s,
<Q>to hear this account of my &s;on; it was a very &s;hocking attempt. So you have acquainted your mi&s;tre&s;s with what happened?</Q></P>
<P>"No, madam," an&s;wered Henrietta,
<Q>that was not nece&s;&s;ary; but when I di&s;covered that lord B&mdash; was the per&s;on who had treated me &s;o freely, I de&s;ired mi&s;s Cordwain to di&s;mi&s;s me, becau&s;e I did not chu&s;e to throw my&s;elf in his way.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85">"That was very prudently re&s;olved," &s;aid the counte&s;s;
<Q>and when are you to leave mi&s;s Cordwain?</Q></P>
<P>"Immediately, madam," replied Henrietta;
<Q>I have provided my&s;elf with a po&s;t-chai&s;e to return to London, and I believe it is now waiting for me.</Q></P>
<P>"Certainly!" &s;aid the counte&s;s (after a little pau&s;e)
<Q>this &s;udden re&s;olution of your's mu&s;t &s;urpri&s;e mi&s;s Cordwain. What did &s;he &s;ay when you acquainted her with it?</Q></P>
<P>"She was extremely angry, madam," replied Henrietta,
<Q>and &s;aid many &s;evere things to me, at which I was then a&s;toni&s;hed; but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Cordwain entertained any unfavourable &s;u&s;|picions of me, her behaviour may be ac|counted for.</Q></P>
<P>"Since you have not acquainted her," &s;aid the counte&s;s,
<Q>with my &s;on's rude attempt upon you, what rea&s;on could &s;he have to &s;u&s;|pect you?</Q></P>
<P>"I know of none, madam," an&s;wered Hen|rietta,
<Q>except his lord&s;hip's &s;peaking to me in the garden a little time ago, may have come to her knowledge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have &s;hewn &s;o much candor in your an&s;wers to my que&s;tions,</Q>
re&s;umed the coun|te&s;s,
<Q>that I am per&s;uaded you will tell me
<PB N="79" REF="86">
frankly the &s;ubject of my &s;on's di&s;cour&s;e to you in the garden.</Q></P>
<P>"I was born to &s;uffer indignities, madam," &s;aid Henrietta, her cheeks glowing with indigna|tion:
<Q>My lord B&mdash;, though he mu&s;t know that I was not ignorant of his honourable pa&s;|&s;ion for mi&s;s Cordwain, yet dared to affront me with the mention of his love.</Q></P>
<P>The counte&s;s was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;ally, which e&s;caped Henrietta in the warmth of her re&s;entment, when &s;he recalled to her re|membrance a declaration, which &s;he looked on as the highe&s;t in&s;ult, &s;ince lord B&mdash; was ac|quainted with her birth. Had the counte&s;s known that it was the niece of the earl of&mdash;, who expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in &s;uch lofty terms, &s;he would have admired that becoming pride, which &s;ugge&s;ted them; but in the waiting-maid of mi&s;s Cordwain, it appeared ab&s;urd and ridiculous, and &s;he was ready to &s;u&s;pect her of artifice and di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>But when &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon Henrietta, and &s;aw the emotion with which &s;he was agi|tated, the deep blu&s;h that glowed on her cheeks, and the tears that trembled in her eyes, &s;he re|proached her&s;elf with the inju&s;tice &s;he was guilty of, in &s;o &s;oon admitting doubts of her inno|cence.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87">Henrietta, &s;uppo&s;ing from the &s;ilence of the counte&s;s, that &s;he had no more to &s;ay to her, courti&s;ied to her re&s;pectfully, and was about to withdraw.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not go," &s;aid that lady, in an obliging accent,
<Q>till I know whether it is in my power to &s;erve you. You have thrown up mi&s;s Cordwain's &s;ervice upon my &s;on's ac|count, it is but ju&s;t therefore that I &s;hould procure you another; if you are not provided for, I will recommend you to my &s;i&s;ter, &s;he will either take you her&s;elf, or &s;ettle you with another lady.</Q></P>
<P>The counte&s;s, in making this offer, had an|other view be&s;ides &s;erving Henrietta. She was not willing to lo&s;e &s;ight of her, for &s;he rightly judged that with &s;o many charms in her per&s;on, and an under&s;tanding far above what we gene|rally found in per&s;ons of her rank, this young woman was very likely to in&s;pire a &s;olid pa&s;|&s;ion; and &s;he dreaded le&s;t her &s;on &s;hould be &s;o far captivated by her as to neglect the advanta|geous match that was now offered him.</P>
<P>If &s;he placed her with her &s;i&s;ter, or with any of her friends, it would not be ea&s;y, &s;he thought, for her &s;on to get acce&s;s to her; or if he re&s;olved to continue his pur&s;uit, his de&s;igns, whatever
<PB N="81" REF="88">
they were, would be known &s;oon enough to be prevented.</P>
<P>Henrietta penetrated no further into the coun|te&s;s's &s;entiments, than what &s;erved to give her a high idea of her benevolence. She accepted her offer with expre&s;&s;ions of the deepe&s;t gratitude; and this the lady con&s;idering as a proof of her &s;incerity and right intentions, &s;he, in the billet which &s;he gave her for her &s;i&s;ter, recommended her in very obliging terms to her favour.</P>
<P>Henrietta again politely thanked her, and, receiving the billet, upon which there was a full direction, &s;he went out of the counte&s;s's chamber, with an intention to depart immediately.</P>
<P>Mrs. Supple, whom &s;he found in the anti-chamber, informed, her, that her chai&s;e was waiting for her at the gate; upon which Hen|rietta took leave of her, and de&s;cended the back|&s;tairs, but was &s;uddenly &s;topped by Mr. Cord|wain, who had followed her, and, &s;eizing her rudely by the arm, charged her with having robbed his daughter.</P>

<P>"GOOD Heaven!" exclaimed Henrietta, in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment,
<Q>what can this mean?</Q></P>
<P>"Look you child," &s;aid the citizen,
<Q>my daughter tells me you have &s;tole her diamond bracelet: any body but my&s;elf would &s;end you to pri&s;on directly; but I am tender-hearted, and con&s;ider, that though I could hang you for this robbery, yet that would be poor &s;ati&s;|faction for &s;uch a lo&s;s: therefore in compa&s;|&s;ion I will &s;pare your life, provided you imme|diately re&s;tore the bracelet.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta had by this time collected her &s;cat|tered &s;pirits, and comprehended the motive of this malicious accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>"May I not &s;ee mi&s;s Cordwain, &s;ir?" &s;aid &s;he, in a compo&s;ed accent;
<Q>I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that I can convince her &s;he wrongs are greatly by this &s;trange &s;u&s;picion.</Q></P>
<P>"See her! what &s;hould you &s;ee her for?" re|plied the old man,

<P>Saying this, he pulled her up &s;tairs, and led her, with no great complai&s;ance, into his daugh|ter's chamber, who &s;at exulting in her &s;ucce&s;sful mi&s;chief, and the di&s;grace &s;he had fixed upon the creature that pre&s;umed to rival her: a blu&s;h how|ever dyed her cheeks at the &s;ight of Henrietta, who, with a look that at once expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t contempt of her mean accu&s;er, and calm confidence in her own untainted innocence, a&s;ked her how &s;he had &s;o far offended her as to make her &s;eek her life?</P>

<Q>have you the a&s;&s;urance to imagine that I am unea&s;y becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e&mdash;You vain &s;aucy flirt&mdash;who told you that I could be jealous of you? And &s;o you &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;but you &s;hall produce my bracelet.</Q></P>

As for the citizen, he &s;tared with &s;tupid wonder upon the injured fair one: for the extraordinary emotion &s;he was in, gave &s;uch ve|hemence to her utterance, and &s;uch fire to her eyes, that he even trembled, as if in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome &s;uperior being. But poor Henrietta, after this &s;udden &s;ally of rage, found her heart &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with the indignity &s;he had &s;uffered, that &s;he bur&s;t into a violent pa&s;&s;ion of tears.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain was ready to renew her in&s;ults; when &s;he found her &s;o mortified, and her father being recovered from his pannick, again urged her to re&s;tore the bracelet; when a &s;ervant came in, and informed them, that dinner was going to be &s;erved, and that his lord and lady expected them in the dining-room.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain immediately obeyed the &s;um|mons, for &s;he dreaded the conclu&s;ion of this affair. When &s;he entered the room, the coun|te&s;s, who knew nothing of what had happened, &s;eeing her look very pale, a&s;ked her, if &s;he was well? and lord B&mdash;, who had pro|mi&s;ed his father to cure her jealou&s;y by redoubled
<PB N="86" REF="93">
a&s;&s;iduity for the future, approached, and, with a well counterfeited tenderne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed his con|cern for her indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain, who had been a&s;&s;ured by her father that the earl earne&s;tly de&s;ired the match between his &s;on and her &s;hould go forward, re|&s;olved not to protract it by any &s;hew of re&s;ent|ment at what was pa&s;t, and therefore received his little a&s;&s;iduities with all the complai&s;ance &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of; but de&s;irous of mortifying him in the per&s;on of her who had &s;o greatly attracted his notice, as well as to give him an opinion of the &s;oftne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he told him, that indeed &s;he was prodigiou&s;ly di&s;compo&s;ed&punc; that her maid had robbed her; "and my father," added &s;he,
<Q>threatens the poor wretch with a pro&s;ecu|tion, and I was weak enough to be exce&s;&s;ively &s;hocked with her blubbering.</Q></P>
<P>"Has your maid robbed you, mi&s;s?" &s;aid the counte&s;s, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q>She has &s;tolen a diamond bracelet from me this very morning, madam,</Q>
replied mi&s;s Cord|wain.</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" cried lord B&mdash;, in a tran|&s;port that deprived him of all con&s;ideration;
<Q>mi&s;s Courteney could not be guilty of any thing mean or &s;candalous.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="94">The&s;e words were &s;carce uttered, when he di&s;covered and repented of his indi&s;cretion; but it was now too late to repair it.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Courteney!" repeated mi&s;s Cordwain, recovering from her &s;urpri&s;e;
<Q>who is mi&s;s Courteney, my lord?</Q></P>
<P>The counte&s;s, perceiving her &s;on was embar|ra&s;&s;ed, endeavoured to relieve him, by asking mi&s;s Cordwain &s;ome que&s;tions concerning her lo&s;s; but that young lady would not be diverted from her que&s;tion.</P>
<P><Q>This creature has a variety of names, I &s;uppo&s;e (&s;aid &s;he): &s;he hired her&s;elf to me by the name of Ben&s;on, and Courteney it &s;eems is that &s;he has been formerly known by. Sure I have been very unfortunate to get &s;uch a wretch to attend me.</Q></P>
<P>"Madam," &s;aid lord B&mdash;, again thrown off his guard by his indignation at hearing a wo|man of Henrietta's merit &s;o gro&s;ly abu&s;ed,
<Q>you don't know who you are &s;peaking of?</Q></P>
<P>"Why, do you know?" &s;aid the earl to his &s;on, in an accent that &s;hewed how extremely he was di&s;plea&s;ed with his imprudence.</P>
<P><Q>Yes, my lord (replied he) I do; and ma|dam,</Q>
pur&s;ued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to mi&s;s Cordwain,
<Q>I am &s;ure you will have candor enough to excu&s;e my engaging with &s;ome
<PB N="88" REF="95">
warmth in the defence of the unfortunate young lady, who is now your &s;ervant&punc; when you &s;hall know that &s;he is the niece of the earl of&mdash;; and that it is her firm attach|ment to the religion &s;he was brought up in, which hinders her from &s;ucceeding to a very large e&s;tate, and makes it nece&s;&s;ary for her to go to &s;ervice for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</Q></P>
<P>This account brought tears into the eyes of the counte&s;s, who inly applauded her&s;elf for her di&s;cernment in the favourable &s;entiments &s;he con|ceived for Henrietta before &s;he knew who &s;he was.</P>
<P>The earl appeared moved, and was begin|ning to ask his &s;on &s;ome que&s;tions concern|ing this fair unfortunate, when mi&s;s Cord|wain fetched a deep &s;igh, and fell back in her chair.</P>
<P>Rage at this di&s;covery of her rival's birth and extraordinary merit, and terror, left the &s;can|dalous accu&s;ation &s;he had forged again&s;t her, &s;hould end in her own di&s;grace, operated &s;o powerfully upon her &s;pirits, that &s;he fainted away.</P>
<P>While the counte&s;s &s;upported her, lord B&mdash; rang the bell very deliberately for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the earl, not much concerned at an accident, which he imputed to a jealou&s;y that proved her
<PB N="89" REF="96">
pa&s;&s;ion for his &s;on, took that opportunity to re|mind him that it was his intere&s;t to improve the affection this young woman had for him.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s, who had in vain &s;earched her pockets for a &s;melling-bottle, ordered a &s;ervant, who appeared at the &s;ummons of the bell, to bring one off her toilet; when Mr. Cordwain entered the room, and, &s;eeing his daughter in that condition, made but one &s;tep from the door to the place where &s;he &s;at, exclaiming,
<Q>Oh! my child, what ails my child? is &s;he dead?</Q></P>
<P>"Don't be alarmed," &s;aid the counte&s;s,
<Q>it is only a fainting fit, &s;he will recover pre|&s;ently.</Q></P>
<P>Lord B&mdash;, who was a&s;hamed to appear wholly inactive upon this occa&s;ion before his de&s;igned father-in-law, had pre&s;ence of mind enough to take a decanter of water from the &s;ide-board, and &s;prinkle &s;ome of it on mi&s;s Cord|wain's face.</P>
<P>This remedy was applied &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that &s;he immediately opened her eyes, but the fir&s;t object they met had like to have clo&s;ed them again: for her father, hearing a &s;melling-bottle called for, remembered that &s;he always carried one or two about her, and, &s;earching her pockets with trembling ha&s;te, pulled out, with a &s;mell|ing-bottle, the bracelet which &s;he had concealed
<PB N="90" REF="97">
there, as a place where it was likely to be mo&s;t &s;ecure, being &s;ubject to no &s;earch but her own.</P>
<P>The old man made none of tho&s;e reflections upon this accident, which were obvious enough to every one el&s;e; but, perceiving his daughter was beginning to recover, pre&s;ented the brace|let, in&s;tead of the &s;melling-bottle to her, con|ceiving the former to be the be&s;t re&s;torative.</P>
<P>"See, child!" cried he, in a tran&s;port,
<Q>I have found your bracelet&mdash;come, you mu&s;t be well now&mdash;I don't wonder you was grieved: truly it would have been a great lo&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain flattered her&s;elf from the words <HI>I have found your bracelet,</HI> that her father had had wit enough to &s;ave her from any reproach, by giving &s;ome favourable turn to the di&s;covery; but in this &s;he greatly over-rated his abilities.</P>
<P>"And where do&s;t think I found it, child:" pur&s;ued the old man:
<Q>even in thy own pocket, as all the company can witne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>"Very true;" &s;aid lord B&mdash;, malici|ou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"Was it found in my pocket?" &s;aid mi&s;s Cordwain.
<Q>Why then, to be &s;ure, I pulled it off with my glove this morning, and forgot it: I prote&s;t I am &s;orry there has been &s;o much noi&s;e made about it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="98">"It is a pity indeed," &s;aid the counte&s;s,
<Q>con|&s;idering who the per&s;on is that was &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tolen it.</Q></P>
<P>"O la! papa," cried mi&s;s Cordwain,
<Q>you don't know that my maid Henrietta is di&s;co|vered to be a great lady. Upon my word it is true,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;eeing him look &s;ur|pri&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry to hear that," &s;aid the citizen, rubbing his forehead;
<Q>for if &s;he has friends who will &s;upport her, &s;he may commence a &s;uit again&s;t me for Scandalum Magnatum, and what a power of money may I lo&s;e&mdash;See what comes of your heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s, girl. I pro|te&s;t I don't know what to do.</Q></P>
<P>The counte&s;s, though &s;he was vexed at the vulgar &s;arca&s;m of the daughter, was neverthele&s;s de&s;irous of freeing the old man from his unea&s;i|ne&s;s, as well as to have an excu&s;e for vi&s;iting the injured young lady.</P>
<P><Q>I am per&s;uaded (&s;aid &s;he) that mi&s;s Cour|teney's delicacy will prevent her from &s;eeking any publick reparation for the affront &s;he has &s;uffered; but I will &s;ee her my&s;elf, and, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, di&s;&s;uade her from taking any re&s;olution to your prejudice.</Q></P>
<P>Lord B&mdash;, who was talking to his father at di&s;tant window, hearing this propo&s;al, ap|proached,
<PB N="92" REF="99">
and, by a look which he gave the counte&s;s his mother, &s;eemed to be&s;peak her ut|mo&s;t tenderne&s;s and complai&s;ance to the afflicted fair one.</P>
<P>Mr. Cordwain thanked her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for her kindne&s;s. "But, Od&s;o! madam." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, &s;topping her as &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<Q>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> your lady&s;hip's pardon, you mu&s;t take the key up with you,</Q>
continued he, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">eling in his pockets, and at la&s;t pulling it out;
<Q>for when I came down, I locked the door for fear the bird &s;hould fly away.</Q>
With the&s;e words, he gave the counte&s;s the key, &s;miling and nod|ding his head in applau&s;e of his own &s;agacity.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s was extremely &s;hocked to hear of this new indignity which the poor young lady had &s;uffered, but &s;he di&s;&s;embled her concern, and &s;ilently withdrew.</P>
<P>Lord B&mdash; again &s;tole to a window to hide his emotions; and the earl, though greatly di&s;|gu&s;ted with the behaviour of both father and daughter, yet approached them with a complai|&s;ant air, and congratulated the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on the re|covery of her jewel.</P>
<P>Thus did the&s;e noble per&s;ons accommodate them&s;elves to the manners of tho&s;e whom they in &s;ecret de&s;pi&s;ed; and, for the &s;ake of a few paltry

<P>THE counte&s;s, who was greatly affected with the cruel u&s;age Henrietta had re|ceived, could with difficulty re&s;train her tears when &s;he entered the room where the fair pri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oner was confined: that air of di&s;tinction which he had ob&s;erved in her before &s;he knew her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rth, &s;eemed now more remarkable, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e humiliating condition to which &s;he was re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uced, a &s;ubject of painful reflection to lady &mdash;, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho approached her with a look of tenderne&s;s and pity, and, taking her hand,</P>

<P>Henrietta was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the kind and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">miliar manner in which the counte&s;s acco&s;ted
<PB N="94" REF="101">
her; but &s;till pre&s;erving that di&s;tant re&s;pect, which was due from the character &s;he had a&s;|&s;umed to a lady of her rank, &s;he courte&s;ied pro|foundly low, and thanked her for the honour &s;he did her in conde&s;cending to bring this grateful piece of news her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t tell you al&s;o," &s;aid the counte&s;s
<Q>that I am not ignorant of your name and fa|mily, nor of your motives for &s;ubmitting to go to &s;ervice; forwhich you de&s;erve to be e&s;teemed and admired by all the world. It was my &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that betrayed your &s;ecret,</Q>

<P>"I beg, madam," &s;aid Henrietta,

<P><Q>I do not wi&s;h, madam, to be known to the per&s;on I &s;erve,</Q>

<Q>and I de&s;ire to have no other con&s;ideration &s;hewn me than what my behaviour in the &s;tation I am placed in &s;hall merit.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="103">"Well," &s;aid the counte&s;s,

<P>"I am obliged to you, madam," &s;aid Hen|rietta,
<Q>for the confidence you repo&s;e in me; I will endeavour to de&s;erve it. And now, madam,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;miling,
<Q>&s;ince my impri&s;onment is at an end, I will, with your lady&s;hip's permi&s;&s;ion, &s;et out immediately for London; the chai&s;e I had hired is, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;till waiting for me. I hope to have the ho|nour of pre&s;enting your letter to lady C&mdash; to-morrow or next day at farthe&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>"Take my kinde&s;t wi&s;hes along with you," &s;aid the counte&s;s, ki&s;&s;ing her, and taking a dia|mond ring from her finger:
<Q>wear this for my &s;ake,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, giving it to Henrietta;
<Q>the intrin&s;ick value of it is but &s;mall, but I hope you will con&s;ider it as a mark of my e&s;teem for you.</Q></P>
<P>The counte&s;s went out of the room as &s;oon as &s;he had &s;poke the&s;e words, leave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Henrietta extremely affected with her kindne&s;s: and all
<PB N="97" REF="104">
ob&s;tacles to her journey being now removed, &s;he ha&s;tened to the gate, placed her&s;elf in her po&s;t|chai&s;e which &s;he found waiting, and in a few moments was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Mean time, the counte&s;s returned to her com|pany, and told Mr. Cordwain, &s;miling, that he had nothing to fear from Henrietta's vindictive re&s;olutions. Upon which, mi&s;s Cordwain &s;aid, &s;he would go up to her, and make her an apo|logy for what had happened; but dinner was that moment &s;erved, which made it not nece&s;&s;ary for the counte&s;s to tell her that Henrietta was gone, in order to prevent her intended civility: but as &s;oon as a proper opportunity offered, &s;he took care to let the young lady know, that her &s;u&s;pi|cions of Henrietta were very ill grounded; that &s;he was perfectly, virtuous; and likely to remain in the ob&s;cure condition of a &s;ervant, unle&s;s her relations, who were per&s;ons of rank and fortune, thought proper to do &s;omething for her.</P>
<P>She added, in order to remove all her unea&s;i|ne&s;s that &s;he had recommended her to a lady who would procure her a place, which was the lea&s;t &s;he could do for a young woman of her birth, in &s;uch unhappy circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cordwain was very well &s;atisfied with what the counte&s;s had done; being per&s;uaded,
<PB N="98" REF="105">
that &s;ince &s;he was &s;o de&s;irous the treaty between lord B&mdash; and her &s;hould go forward, that &s;he would take care to hinder any thing from hap|pening on the part of Henrietta, that might give her cau&s;e for di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>But poor lord B&mdash; was in a truly pitiable &s;ituation: he was in love with the per&s;on of Henrietta, and the fortune of mi&s;s Cordwain; and the&s;e different pa&s;&s;ions by turns equally po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to form any fixed re&s;olution.</P>
<P>When he reflected on the &s;olid advantages that would accrue to him from a marriage with the packer's daughter, &s;uch as being enabled to play as high at Arthur's as my lord&mdash;, to bring as many race-hor&s;es to New-Market as &mdash;, to have as &s;plendid equipages as the earl of &mdash;, and &s;everal others, which make the envy and emulation of many of our pre&s;ent race of nobles, he was ready to &s;acrifice his inclina|tions to motives &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o rea&s;onable, &s;o meri|torious.</P>
<P>But when the image of Henrietta ro&s;e to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thoughts; her per&s;on &s;o lovely, her manners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> elegant, her birth not beneath his own, her virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o eminent; how could he think of putting &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a trea&s;ure out of his reach, by marrying her de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">picable rival!

of this trea&s;ure, and &s;o high his value of it, that, provided any method could be found to reconcile her to her aunt, and &s;ecure to her the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of her e&s;tate, he would willingly have renounced his preten&s;ions to mi&s;s Cordwain, and have mar|ried Henrietta; though her fortune, as heire&s;s of lady Meadows's e&s;tate, would be &s;ome thou&s;ands le&s;s than mi&s;s Cordwain's.</P>
<P>Such a proof of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, he thought, mu&s;t needs be very grateful to a young woman of Henrietta's fine under&s;tanding and enlarged &s;en|timents; and, having brought him&s;elf to this point, his next care was to procure a private in|terview with her, that he might acquaint her with his de&s;igns, and engage her concurrence with them.</P>
<P>But this &s;cheme being defeated by her &s;udden departure, which he learned from his mother, he was plunged into new perplexity and unea&s;i|ne&s;s. He asked the counte&s;s, with an air of in|difference and unconcern, where &s;he was gone, and how &s;he intended to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf? But that di&s;cerning lady, who ob&s;erved his &s;udden e|motion at the news of Henrietta's departure, would give him no other &s;atisfaction than telling him, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would again go to &s;ervice; for &s;he &s;eemed to have no expec|tations of any &s;avour from her relations.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="107">Lord B&mdash;, after a little reflection, com|forted him&s;elf with a hope, that &s;ome accident or other would again throw her in his way; and that the di&s;gu&s;t &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily entertain, to a way of life &s;o unworthy of her, would induce her to embrace his honourable propo&s;als: for &s;uch he conceived them to be, &s;ince all the &s;acri|fice he &s;hould expect from her, was a tempo|rary compliance with her aunt's inclinations with regard to religion: but however, he thought it would be prudent not to break, off with mi&s;s Cord|wain, becau&s;e in her fortune he would always find wherewithal to comfort him&s;elf, if he was di&s;appointed in his love.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this wi&s;e re&s;olution, he be|haved in &s;uch a manner to that young lady, as gave her no cau&s;e to be di&s;plea&s;ed with him; &s;o that every thing in this noble family, and their de&s;igned allies, was upon the &s;ame footing as be|fore Henrietta, with mi&s;chief-making beauty, came in the way.</P>

<BIBL>YOUNG'S UNIVERSAL PASSION.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MEAN time our fair heroine, having per|formed her little journey without any un|fortunate accident, arrived late in the evening at the hou&s;e of her friend Mrs. Willis, who, in her a&s;toni&s;hment at her &s;udden return, a&s;ked her a hundred que&s;tions in a breath.</P>
<P>Henrietta &s;atisfied her eager curio&s;ity with a &s;uccinct detail of all that had happened to
<PB N="102" REF="109">
her that day, which had indeed been a very bu&s;y one.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t heart of Mrs. Willis was variou&s;ly affected with the different parts of her &s;tory&punc; She wept for her &s;ufferings: &s;he execrated the malicious mi&s;s Cordwain; &s;he prai&s;ed the coun|te&s;s; and was exceedingly &s;olicitous about the purport of lord B&mdash;'s de&s;igns, which, from what &s;he had heard of his behaviour, appeared to her very my&s;terious. But Henrietta, who had a thorough contempt for that young lord, declared, that although he &s;hould break with mi&s;s Cordwain, and addre&s;s her upon honoura|ble terms, yet &s;he could not bring her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to approve of him.</P>
<P><Q>He is mean (&s;aid &s;he) and &s;ordid in his temper. His principles are bad: he is a lord, but he is not a gentleman; and I am &s;ure I could never e&s;teem him. Be&s;ides the coun|te&s;s, who is more alarmed about the &s;enti|ments he has for me than I think &s;he has rea|&s;on, depends upon my honour not to encou|rage any overtures from him, and I will not abu&s;e her confidence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is ea&s;y (pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;miling) to be ju&s;t when our own inclinations do not oppo&s;e it. I &s;hall pretend to no merit in making this &s;a|crifice, if ever it be in my power to make it;
<PB N="103" REF="110">
becau&s;e in reality it will not be a great one. If riches and &s;plendor could have made me happy, I would have married &s;ir I&s;aac Darby; for it was not his age that I objected to mo&s;t, but tho&s;e qualities and manners which made his age contemptible.</Q></P>
<P>"But, &s;urely, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>your gratitude would be engaged, &s;hould lord B&mdash;, in the pre&s;ent inequality of your cir|cum&s;tances, make you an offer of his hand.</Q></P>
<P>"Not at all," replied Henrietta, with &s;ome warmth:
<Q>no man has a right to the love or e&s;teem of a woman on whom he has enter|tained di&s;honourable de&s;igns, and, failing in them, offers marriage at la&s;t. The lover, who marries his mi&s;tre&s;s only becau&s;e he can|not gain her upon ea&s;ier terms, has ju&s;t as much genero&s;ity as the highwayman who leaves a traveller in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his money, becau&s;e he is not able to take it from him.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, well, my dear mi&s;s," &s;aid Mrs. Willis, &s;miling,
<Q>I can collect this at lea&s;t from the nice di&s;tinctions you make, that your heart is ab&s;olutely free; you would not rea&s;on &s;o well, were there any &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion in the ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="111">"Surely," replied Henrietta,
<Q>you do not imagine that I &s;hould become le&s;s delicate in my notions for being in love: that pa&s;&s;ion, like &s;ome plants, derives its qualities from the &s;oil it grows in; for in&s;tance, in lord B&mdash;, it is mean, &s;elfi&s;h, wavering.</Q></P>
<P>"And what would it be in you?" interrupted Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>"Ah! no matter," cried Henrietta:
<Q>I am not in love yet, and never will by with a man who has &s;uch &s;entiments as lord B&mdash;; he had be&s;t be con&s;tant to mi&s;s Cordwain. Ple|bean lords and the nobility of the &s;hop and warehou&s;e are equal matches.</Q></P>
<P>To this remark Mrs. Willis, who was plea&s;ed with the vivacity of her fair friend&punc; a&s;&s;ented only with a &s;mile: for &s;upper was now placed upon the table; and, as &s;he knew Henrietta had not dined, &s;he was extremely &s;olicitous to make her eat, and with the &s;ame maternal fondne&s;s hur|ried her &s;oon to bed, that &s;he might recover the fatigue &s;he had &s;uffered during the day.</P>
<P>The next morning at eleven o clock, our fair heroine &s;et out in an hackney-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ach for &mdash; &s;quare, where lady D&mdash; h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, to whom &s;he was to deliver the recommendatory letter which the counte&s;s had given her.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112">The lady was at her toilet when &s;he read her &s;i&s;ter's letter, which Henrietta had &s;ent in to her, and immediately ordered her admittance. Surpri&s;ed at the elegant figure which met her eyes in the gla&s;s upon our fair heroine's entering the room, &s;he ha&s;tily turned her head, and gazed on Henrietta &s;o intently, that &s;he blu&s;hed; which lady D&mdash; ob&s;erving, obligingly de&s;ired her to &s;it down, and &s;aid, &s;he would talk to her pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Henrietta mode&s;tly placed her&s;elf at a di&s;tance, but &s;o luckily for the lady's curio&s;ity, that &s;he could have a full view of her in her gla&s;s, with|out renewing her confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"My &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid lady D&mdash;, breaking &s;i|lence at la&s;t,
<Q>has mentioned you very advan|tageou&s;ly, Mrs. Ben&s;on, I wi&s;h it may be in my power to &s;erve you.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta bowed re&s;pectfully.</P>
<P>"You are very young," pur&s;ued the lady;
<Q>I &s;uppo&s;e mi&s;s Cordwain's was the fir&s;t &s;ervice you ever lived in?</Q></P>
<P>At the word Service Henrietta blu&s;hed again; and indeed the lady did not pronounce it with|out &s;ome he&s;itation, for having a &s;en&s;ible and ingenuous mind, &s;he felt the impropriety of the term when u&s;ed towards a per&s;on, who, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="106" REF="113">
the humility of her deportment, had a dignity in her looks and air, which com|manded re&s;pect. She took notice of this emo|tion, and the more becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw it endea|voured to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and being de&s;irous of gaining &s;ome further knowledge of her, &s;he a&s;ked her a hundred little que&s;tions, which &s;he thought would lead her to an explanation of her circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>Henrietta avoided making a di&s;covery of her|&s;elf, but an&s;wered in &s;uch a manner, as, with|out &s;atisfying the lady's curio&s;ity, gave her a very good opinion of her candor and her &s;en&s;e: but &s;he was particularly &s;truck with the graceful ea&s;e with which &s;he talked; and ob&s;erved &s;uch a perfect politene&s;s in her manners, as per&s;uaded her &s;he was born in a much higher rank than her pre&s;ent &s;ituation allowed the probability of.</P>
<P>Lady D&mdash;'s daughter now entered the room, and a&s;ked her mamma, if &s;he de&s;ired to hear her take a le&s;&s;on from her &s;inging-ma&s;ter that morning?</P>
<P>The lady ordered the ma&s;ter to be admitted, upon which Henrietta ro&s;e up to go away; but the lady told her, with a benevolent &s;mile, that &s;he &s;hould &s;tay and hear mi&s;s D&mdash;perform, and de&s;ired her to re&s;ume her &s;eat.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="114">While the young lady was &s;inging, lady D&mdash; kept her eyes fixed on Henrietta's face, and, from the &s;weet expre&s;&s;ion in it, collecting that &s;he had a ta&s;te for mu&s;ick, a&s;ked her, if &s;he had ever been taught?</P>
<P>Henrietta, though not willing to make a di&s;|play of talents which were not nece&s;&s;ary to her pre&s;ent condition, yet owned, that &s;he had a little knowledge of mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>Lady D&mdash; immediately de&s;ired to hear her &s;ing, and the young lady at the &s;ame time pre|&s;enting her guitar to her, &s;he was obliged to comply. Her air, her attitude, the exqui&s;ite grace with which &s;he touched the little in&s;tru|ment, the &s;weetne&s;s of her voice, and the &s;en|&s;ibility in her fine eyes, charmed lady D&mdash;, who was an enthu&s;ia&s;tick admirer of the art, &s;o that &s;he cried out in a kind of tran&s;port,
<Q>Mr. Minime! would you not be proud of &s;uch a &s;cholar?</Q></P>
<P>"Madam," &s;aid the ma&s;ter, bowing,
<Q>the young gentlewoman has a very pretty voice and manner, to be &s;ure: but if mi&s;s D&mdash; applies clo&s;ely to mu&s;ick for &s;even or eight years longer, and does not &s;uffer her mind to be di&s;tracted with the &s;tudy of other &s;ciences, I &s;hall have more rea&s;on to be proud of my &s;cholar than any ma&s;ter in the world.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="115">This &s;peech forced a &s;mile from Henrietta, who the third time ro&s;e up to be gone, upon hearing a female vi&s;iter announced; but lady D&mdash;, conceiving that &s;he was not obliged to a &s;trict ob&s;ervation of ceremony with the per|&s;on that was now entering, again in&s;i&s;ted upon Henrietta's &s;taying, telling her, &s;he had thought of &s;omething for her; and that &s;he would ac|quaint her with it as &s;oon as the lady was gone.</P>
<P>Henrietta had but ju&s;t time to expre&s;s a grate|ful acknowledgment of her kindne&s;s, when the vi&s;iter was introduced. She was a woman or a mean a&s;pect, but had a great deal of &s;elf|&s;ufficiency in her air. After the u&s;ual compli|ments were over, &s;he threw her&s;elf into an ea&s;y chair, and examined Henrietta with &s;uch extreme attention, that &s;he blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>The lady, who took con&s;equence to her&s;elf from the power of throwing on ingenuous mind into confu&s;ion, finding that Henrietta was op|pre&s;&s;ed by her looks, gazed at her the more ear|ne&s;tly: and having indulged her&s;elf &s;everal mi|nutes in this exertion of her &s;uperiority, thought it was now time to make the poor ba&s;hful girl &s;tare in her turn, and began to di&s;play her wit and learning; the former in an inundation of
<PB N="109" REF="116">
words that &s;wallowed up her meaning, and the latter in French words and phra&s;es, brought in to &s;upply the deficiencies of her own native tongue.</P>
<P>Lady D&mdash;, who was u&s;ed to divert her&s;elf with the &s;ingularity of this woman's character, li&s;tened to her with complai&s;ance. But Hen|rietta, who began to conceive a very mean opi|nion of a lady who &s;eemed to value her&s;elf &s;o highly upon the knowledge of a language, which was now become a part of every cobler's daugh|ter's education, beheld her with an indifference that &s;en&s;ibly wounded her pride, and made her have recour&s;e to other methods to impre&s;s her prodigious con&s;equence upon her; and &s;ince &s;he could not make her &s;tare at her learning, &s;he was re&s;olved to make her wonder at her principles.</P>
<P><Q>You know, lady D&mdash; (&s;aid &s;he abruptly) I do not often go to church.</Q></P>
<P>"I know it, and I am &s;orry for it," replied her lady&s;hip.</P>
<P><Q>Upon my word (&s;aid &s;he) I have too much reverence for the Deity to go to a place where it is ten to one but I &s;hall hear him bla&s;|phemed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="117">Henrietta now began to &s;tare indeed. The wonderful lady proceeded,</P>
<P><Q>I never pretend to deny that I am a dei&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>"You mu&s;t pardon me, Mrs. &mdash;," in|terrupted lady D&mdash;,
<Q>if I tell you that I really think you often declare that very impro|perly; I have heard you &s;ay &s;o before your children and &s;ervants.</Q></P>
<P>"Madam," replied Mrs. &mdash;
<Q>I take care that my &s;ervants &s;hall not think me an athei&s;t. They know my principles better: they know I am a dei&s;t; they have heard me declare that I believe there is an Intelligent cau&s;e which governs the world by phy&s;ical rules. As for moral attributes, there is no &s;uch thing; it is impious and ab&s;urd to &s;up|po&s;e it. The arbitrary con&s;titution of things in the human &s;y&s;tem produces happine&s;s and mi&s;ery; that is to &s;ay, mi&s;ery and happine&s;s is productive of&mdash;Or rather, as I &s;aid before, the arbitrary con&s;titution of things, vice and virtue, is nece&s;&s;arily produced by&mdash;that is, nece&s;&s;arily brings on happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.&mdash; Prayer, and &s;uch like artifices of religion, is fooli&s;h: for whatever is, is right. To talk of imitating God, is bla&s;phemy. His Provi|dence is extended to collective bodies only;
<PB N="111" REF="118">
he has no regard to individuals: nor is the &s;oul a di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tance from the body. There is no future &s;tate; it is all a fiction. To argue from unequal di&s;tributions is ab&s;urd and bla&s;|phemous. Whatever is, is be&s;t. The law of nature is &s;ufficiently clear; and there is no need of any &s;upernatural revelation.</Q></P>
<P>"I mu&s;t intreat you, madam," interrupted lady D&mdash;, &s;eeing her elde&s;t daughter that moment enter the room,
<Q>to change the di&s;|cour&s;e now, mi&s;s has not been u&s;ed to &s;uch deep rea&s;oning on the&s;e aweful &s;ubjects, and may perhaps mi&s;take what you are &s;aying for bla&s;phemy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>More ab&s;urd mi&s;takes than that may be made, madam,</Q>
replied Mrs. &mdash;,
<Q>when per&s;ons are not allowed to exerci&s;e their men|tal faculties&mdash; but your lady&s;hip is going to dre&s;s&mdash;I interrupt you.</Q>
Saying this, &s;he ro&s;e "up, and lady D&mdash; making no efforts to de|tain her, took her leave.</P>
<P>"I have always hated that woman," &s;aid mi&s;s D&mdash;, as &s;oon as &s;he was gone,
<Q>ever &s;ince I heard her ridicule parental affection, and call it brutual in&s;tinct.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh," &s;aid lady D&mdash;, laughing,
<Q>it would ill become one of her elevated under|&s;tanding, to have natural affections: tho&s;e &s;he
<PB N="112" REF="119">
treats as vulgar prejudices. Her own &s;ex are the objects of her &s;corn, becau&s;e they are &s;ub|ject to &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es as tenderne&s;s and pity. She reads Seneca on friend&s;hip in the morn|ing; and exclaims, O the exalted pa&s;&s;ion! how divinely he treats it! what noble &s;enti|ments! In the afternoon &s;he over-reaches her friend, and applauds her own wi&s;dom. Epic|tetus is &s;tudied with great care. She will preach a moral &s;ermon out of Epictetus that will la&s;t two hours. Epictetus teaches her to regulate her pa&s;&s;ions. She reads him in|tently while her maid is combing her hair, and clo&s;es her book to &s;torm at the poor trembling creature for accidentally hurting her with the comb.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Henrietta makes a very fanta&s;tick di&s;tinction.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta could not help &s;miling at lady D&mdash;'s &s;atirical manner of expo&s;ing the follies of the lady who had ju&s;t left the room: but a female free-thinker was, in her opinion, &s;o &s;hocking a character, that &s;he would much rather have &s;een it the object of abhorrence than mirth.</P>
<P>Lady D&mdash; put an end to her reflections: for, turning towards her,
<Q>Mrs. Ben&s;on (&s;aid &s;he) it is time to think of you now.</Q>
Hen|rietta immediately ro&s;e from her &s;eat.</P>
<P>"There is a lady of my acquaintance," pur|&s;ued lady D&mdash;,
<Q>to whom your accompli&s;h|ments of &s;inging and playing will make you a very acceptable companion: and indeed I think it is a pity a young woman of your ap|pearance and genteel education &s;hould remain in the condition of a &s;ervant, which I am per|&s;uaded you was not born to.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="121">Henrietta blu&s;hed; which lady D&mdash; ob|&s;erving, "come," &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling,
<Q>be in|genuous, and confe&s;s that the propo&s;al I have made you will &s;uit you better than being a &s;ervant.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed, madam, it does not," replied Hen|rietta;
<Q>I am extremely obliged to your lady|&s;hip for your kind intentions, but I had rather be recommended to the lady as a &s;ervant than in any other character.</Q></P>
<P>"You &s;urpri&s;e me," &s;aid lady D&mdash;, after a little pau&s;e;
<Q>what objections can you have to a &s;ituation &s;o much to be preferred to &s;ervitude?</Q></P>
<P>"I am very &s;ure, madam," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>that I have not too much pride to be a &s;er|vant, &s;ince it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould be one: but I am afraid I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a dependent.</Q></P>
<P>Lady D&mdash;, a little di&s;appointed to find her&s;elf &s;o far below this ob&s;cure young per&s;on in delicacy of &s;entiment, an&s;wered gravely,</P>
<P><Q>Well, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, I will &s;erve you in your own way; let me &s;ee you again a few days hence, by that time I may po&s;&s;ibly have heard of &s;omething for you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="122">Henrietta again politely thanked her lady&s;hip, and withdrew, leaving lady D&mdash; and her daughter differently affected with her behaviour in this la&s;t in&s;tance: for young minds are apt to be &s;truck with uncommon &s;entiments, and to admire &s;uch as &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s them; while per&s;ons advanced in years, either from experi|ence of the world, or the natural depravity of the human heart, a&s;cribe every thing to affecta|tion and de&s;ign, that contradicts certain received maxims in life.</P>
<P>However, Henrietta's peculiarity made lady D&mdash; extremely de&s;irous to know who &s;he was, and whether there was any thing extraor|dinary in her circum&s;tances. She wrote to the counte&s;s her &s;i&s;ter, expre&s;&s;ing her curio&s;ity: but that lady was re&s;olved to keep Henrietta's &s;ecret, as well in regard to the promi&s;e &s;he had given her, as becau&s;e &s;he really thought an un&s;ea&s;on|able di&s;covery of her true name and family would be di&s;advantageous to the plan &s;he had laid.</P>
<P>She therefore contented her&s;elf with telling her &s;i&s;ter, in her an&s;wer, that Mrs. Ben&s;on was a very de&s;erving young woman, who had been well brought up, but, by misfortunes in her fa|mily, reduced to go to &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="123">Lady D&mdash; was &s;atisfied with this account; and when Henrietta, in obedience to her com|mands, waited on her again, &s;he received her with great benevolence; told her, &s;he had re|commended her to a lady of great fortune, who&s;e place &s;he believed would be an advan|tageous one; and ordered her own woman to go with a me&s;&s;age to the lady, and introduce her.</P>
<P>Henrietta having a hackney-coach waiting, lady D&mdash;'s woman and her, after &s;ome cere|monies which our fair heroine would gladly have di&s;pen&s;ed with, &s;eated them&s;elves in it; and, as &s;oon as it drove from the door, the Abi|gail began,</P>
<P><Q>Well, madam, you are certainly very for|tunate, Mrs. Autumn's place is one of the be&s;t in Chri&s;tendom: you have nothing to do but to flatter her, and you will gain her heart for ever.</Q></P>
<P>"Is the lady fond of flattery then?" &s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P>"Oh! immen&s;ely," cried the other;
<Q>but for fear you &s;hould mi&s;take, and compliment her in the wrong place, you mu&s;t know (and I think it is very lucky that I had an oppor|tunity of in&s;tructing you) you mu&s;t know that though &s;he is between forty and fifty years of
<PB N="117" REF="124">
age, &s;he affects to be thought extremely young; and having been hand&s;ome in her youth, as my lady &s;ays, &s;he forgets &s;he is no longer &s;o now &s;he is old.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now, dear madam, this is your cue. Be &s;ure to prai&s;e her bloomy complexion, and the brightne&s;s of her eyes; and, if &s;he bids you gue&s;s how old &s;he is, as 'tis ten to one but &s;he will &s;ome time hence, don't exceed twenty years, I charge you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The poor &s;imple girl that lived with her la&s;t, lo&s;t her place, by &s;aying, when &s;he a&s;ked her how old &s;he believed her to be, that &s;he took her lady&s;hip to be about the &s;ame age as her mother. She was a vulgar creature, to be &s;ure. You, madam, are in no danger of &s;peaking &s;o improperly. But on certain occa&s;ions you may contradict her rudely, and &s;he will be the more plea&s;ed; as for in&s;tance, when &s;he &s;ays &s;he looks horridly! tell her in a &s;urly way, as if you were vexed at her perver&s;ene&s;s, that you never &s;aw her look &s;o hand&s;ome.</Q></P>
<P>"Mighty well," &s;aid Henrietta, &s;miling,
<Q>I perceive you are excellent in this art; I am&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="125">"Oh! no thanks, dear madam," interrupted lady D&mdash;'s woman,
<Q>I am fond of doing good offices.</Q></P>
<P>"I was going to &s;ay," replied Henrietta,
<Q>that I am afraid the&s;e wi&s;e documents will be thrown away upon me.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope not," &s;aid the other, gravely.
<Q>Come, take courage, you are but a young be|ginner; the&s;e things come of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I &s;hould be &s;orry you were not capable of taking good coun&s;el.</Q></P>
<P>They were now arrived at Mrs. Autumn's hou&s;e: lady D&mdash;'s woman &s;ent up word, that &s;he was come with the per&s;on her lady had re|commended to her lady&s;hip; upon which both were ordered to go up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>They found the lady giving audience to millener, a mantua-maker, and a mercer.

<P>Mrs. Echo withdrew; and the lady re&s;uming her contemplative po&s;ture, gave Henrietta an opportunity of con&s;idering her at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>If lady D&mdash;'s woman had not fixed her age at &s;omewhat more than forty, &s;he would have con|cluded her to have been older, by the deep furrows in her face, her fallen cheeks, and the poor &s;hri|vell'd hand that &s;upported her head: but her dre&s;s &s;poke her &s;carce fifteen; a French fillet &s;upplied the place of a cap, and &s;erved to bind the few &s;traggling hairs that graced her tem|ples, to a t&egrave;te, which was &s;o loaded with hair, that her head &s;eemed to be of an enormous &s;ize. The re&s;t of her dre&s;s was &s;uited exactly to the childi&s;h ornaments of her head; and though no object could be more ridiculous, yet Henrietta beheld her with a &s;erious concern; for, true benevolence compa&s;&s;ionates tho&s;e follies which unfeeling hearts &s;acrifice to mirth.</P>
<P>Mrs. Autumn at length ro&s;e up;
<Q>that mu&s;t be the thing,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, pointing to a pink and &s;ilver. She then gave &s;ome directions to her millener; and, &s;uddenly interrupting her&s;elf,
<PB N="120" REF="127">
turned with a lively air to the mercer, and a&s;ked him, why he had not cut off the &s;ilk?</P>
<P><Q>Your lady&s;hip did not tell me how much you wanted,</Q>
replied the trade&s;man.</P>
<P>"Lord! I am the giddie&s;t creature," ex|claimed Mrs. Autumn. This matter however was &s;oon &s;ettled, and the important bu&s;ine&s;s with the millener di&s;patched, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her trades-people, and, throwing her&s;elf with an af|fected air upon a &s;ettee, ordered Henrietta to come forward.</P>
<P><Q>I was afraid (&s;aid &s;he) that lady D&mdash;, who is very fond of &s;eeing grave &s;olemn faces about her, had &s;ent me &s;ome antiquated crea|ture that would have frightened me; but you &s;eem to be a &s;prightly young body: we &s;hall agree very well, I hope.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta courte&s;ied.</P>
<P>"I hate old people," pur&s;ued the lady;
<Q>they are generally ob&s;tinate and &s;urly. God help us, we &s;hall all be old if we live&mdash;but when one is in years one's &s;elf it is time enough to be plagued with the humours of tho&s;e that are<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you will &s;uit me extremely well.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta courte&s;ied again.</P>
<P>"You are no talker, I find," &s;aid Mrs. Au|tumn, a little chagrined that the hints &s;he had thrown out, had produced nothing which could
<PB N="121" REF="128">
flatter her extreme de&s;ire of being thought young.
<Q>Well, there is no great harm in that; I &s;hall take you upon lady D&mdash;'s recommendation. As for terms&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"Madam," &s;aid Henrietta, who now for the fir&s;t time opened her mouth;
<Q>they &s;hall be whatever you think proper.</Q></P>
<P>"Very well," &s;aid the lady,
<Q>we will talk no more about them then; if you can find out how to plea&s;e me, which will be no dif|ficult matter I a&s;&s;ure you, my place may prove a very advantageous one, and the &s;ooner you come the better.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta told her, &s;he was ready to come whenever &s;he plea&s;ed. Upon which, Mrs. Au|tumn, with the pretty impatience of youth, asked her, if it would be any inconvenience to her to come that very night?</P>
<P>Henrietta, who was naturally obliging, a&s;|&s;ured her it would not; and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a gracious &s;mile for her ready compliance.</P>
<P>Mrs, Willis, who had flattered her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the company of her amiable friend for a few weeks at lea&s;t, was greatly di&s;|appointed when &s;he found &s;he was to lo&s;e her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;oon; and gently blamed her for being &s;o pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pitate.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="129">Henrietta gave her the character of the lady &s;he was going to live with, and repeated what &s;he had &s;aid to her.
<Q>You may be &s;ure (added &s;he) that I &s;hall never plea&s;e Mrs. Autumn in the way &s;he expects to be plea&s;ed. Flattery is always mean; but to flatter &s;olly, is, in my opinion, criminal. However, I gladly em|braced the fir&s;t opportunity that offered to &s;hew my willingne&s;s to oblige, though I would not flatter her. You will hardly believe me, perhaps (&s;aid &s;he, &s;miling) when I tell you, that one of the greate&s;t bars to my happine&s;s in my pre&s;ent humble &s;ituation is, the dif|ficulty of plea&s;ing without wounding my own delicacy and candor. It is not ea&s;y to live well with our &s;uperiors, and pre&s;erve our in|tegrity, but it is not impo&s;&s;ible; and, if fail in that attempt, I &s;hall at lea&s;t have this &s;atisfaction, that I &s;uffer in the cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> virtue.</Q></P>

<P>"That I will not do," replied Henrietta;
<Q>and &s;ince I have learned not to fear poverty, my happine&s;s will never depend upon others.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Willis, finding &s;he could not prevail with her fair friend to alter her re&s;olution, ac|quie&s;ced in it at length; and Henrietta, taking an affectionate leave of her, repaired to her new habitation.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which &s;hews Henrietta in her new &s;ervice, where &s;he acquits her&s;elf extremely ill.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE lady being engaged with company when Henrietta arrived, &s;he did not &s;ee her till late at night, when &s;he was &s;ummoned to undre&s;s her.</P>
<P>"Come hither, Henrietta," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;oon as &s;he entered the room;
<Q>I have &s;een lady D&mdash; &s;ince you was here&mdash;She has given me &s;uch an advantageous account of your under|&s;tanding, that I am re&s;olved to make you my confidant.</Q></P>
<P>At the word Confidant Henrietta looked a little confu&s;ed; but the lady, who did not ob|&s;erve her emotion, reclined her head upon her hand, and, fixing her eyes on her gla&s;s to &s;ee how this pen&s;ive attitude became her.</P>
<P><Q>I am certainly (pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;ighing) the mo&s;t unfortunate woman in the world&mdash;Ben|&s;on, if you would be happy, never marry.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have no thought of marriage at pre&s;ent, madam,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="132">"Ah, how I envy your freedom," &s;aid the antiquated fair;
<Q>you are plagued with no un|rea&s;onable jealou&s;y. Ben&s;on, you will not be here long before you are a witne&s;s to my per|&s;ecutions. I wi&s;h I could conceal them, but that is impo&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;orry, madam," &s;aid Henrietta, who was under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aying &s;omething in an|&s;wer to this &s;trange &s;tuff,
<Q>to hear that you have any thing to make you unea&s;y.</Q></P>
<P>"It does not &s;ignify," exclaimed the lady, with an emotion which &s;he her&s;elf took to be real;
<Q>I &s;hall be choaked if I don't &s;peak; may I depend upon your prudence, Ben&s;on!&mdash;But I know I may. Well then, you mu&s;t know there is a poor young fellow who pretends&mdash; But why do I &s;ay pretends&mdash;who is de&s;pe|rately &mdash;what &s;hall I call it&mdash;who has an un|conquerable, invincible, hopele&s;s, fatal, dying pa&s;&s;ion for&mdash;for me, in &s;hort. Is not this a &s;hocking thing?</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed! madam," replied Henrietta, with great truth, "I pity you extremely."</P>
<P>"Ay, am I not greatly to be pitied, child?" &s;aid the lady.
<Q>Then the poor wretch cannot conceal his &s;olly; and it makes Mr. Autumn &s;o unea&s;y, that really his temper is intolera|ble.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="133">"Pardon me, madam," &s;aid Henrietta;
<Q>but I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that Mr. Autumn is unea&s;y at &s;uch folly as you ju&s;tly call it.</Q></P>
<P>"Why, to be &s;ure it is folly," &s;aid Mrs. Au|tum:
<Q>but then, if one reflects a little&mdash; It is not folly neither&mdash; for love, you know, is an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion. So that&mdash; but you have a very unfeeling heart, Ben&s;on; and yet, to judge by your looks, you &s;hould have great &s;en&s;ibility. Pray, have you never felt the tender pa&s;&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P>"If you mean love, madam," replied Hen|rietta; "indeed I cannot &s;ay I have."</P>
<P>"Well, you will be a happy creature," &s;aid the lady, &s;ighing,
<Q>if you can always main|tain this indifference: but poor Langui&s;h mu&s;t not expect to meet with much compa&s;&s;ion from you. Poor wretch! (continued &s;he, laughing) I cannot help triumphing a little. I have nick-named him Langui&s;h from his eternal &s;ighing, and the melancholy roll of his eyes. Mr. Autumn cannot endure to hear me call him by this name; but I love to plague him a little now and then: what &s;ig|nifies power, if one does not &s;hew one has it. Yet he ought to be &s;atisfied with me for what I did this evening, when Langui&s;h indi&s;creetly betrayed the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, by ea|gerly
<PB N="127" REF="134">
running (though there were two gen|tlemen nearer) to take up my glove which I had dropped: I took no notice of the dying air with which he pre&s;ented it to me; but, as if his touch had polluted it, I received it haughtily from him, and threw it a&s;ide. Sure this in&s;tance of di&s;dain was enough to &s;atisfy a jealous hu&s;band; yet mine, in&s;tead of looking plea&s;ed, coloured with jealou&s;y and rage, and gave me &s;uch furious glances: however, this will always be the ca&s;e, where there is &s;o great a di&s;proportion in age; Mr. Autumn is not le&s;s than forty. But hey day! is the girl a&s;leep?</Q>
continued &s;he, looking at Henrietta, who &s;tood fixed in thought; for the ab&s;urd affectation of her mi&s;tre&s;s gave her matter enough for reflection.
<Q>Come, un|dre&s;s me; Mr. Autumn will wonder at my long &s;tay, and as he is ingenious in torment|ing him&s;elf, he will po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect that I have been reading a letter from this rival of his; but there he over-rates his pre&s;umption, he has not ventured to write to me yet, his pa&s;&s;ion is only expre&s;&s;ed in &s;ighs and looks.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta made ha&s;te to obey her, her patience being almo&s;t exhau&s;ted; for Mrs. Autumn had got on a &s;ubject which &s;he knew not how to quit, and her women being the only per&s;ons to whom &s;he
<PB N="128" REF="135">
could utter the&s;e extravagancies, without any danger of being mortified with &s;arca&s;tick hints of age, and &s;uch envious and unju&s;t reflections, &s;he made her&s;elf amends with them, for the re&s;erve &s;he was much again&s;t her will obliged to maintain with others.</P>
<P>Henrietta was at length ordered to wait on her to her chamber, and &s;oon after retired to her own, greatly out of humour with her mi&s;tre&s;s, and not a little di&s;plea&s;ed at her&s;elf, to find that her philo&s;ophy, by which &s;he was enabled to bear the change of her fortune with patience and re&s;ignation, could not guard her again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ful|ne&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t at the follies &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed to be witne&s;s to.</P>
<P>Mrs. Autumn, like other modern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, lay in bed always till it was very late this being one of tho&s;e happy expedients for killing time (as the fa&s;hionable phra&s;e is) which, to di&s;cover, employs the inventions of per&s;ons of rank and fortune. Henrietta had attended three whole hours in her lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room, in expectation every moment of being &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to ri&s;e, when Mr. Autumn at length entered the room.</P>
<P>His &s;ervant, while he was dre&s;&s;ing him, had told him, that his lady's new woman, whom he had a glymp&s;e of as he pa&s;&s;ed by her on the &s;tairs,
<PB N="129" REF="136">
was the greate&s;t beauty he ever beheld; &s;o that being curious to &s;ee her, he came to breakfa&s;t with his wife that morning.</P>
<P>Henrietta ro&s;e up at his entrance; Mr. Autumn bowed, looked at her attentively, and thought his man had ta&s;te. But he was &s;till more &s;truck with her noble air than the charms of her face, and felt an unea&s;y emotion when he &s;aw her continue &s;tanding, with that humble re&s;pect, which, although it became her &s;ituation, &s;eemed little &s;uited to the dignity of her appearance.
<Q>Is not Mrs. Autumn up, madam?</Q>
&s;aid he, not being able to forbear u&s;ing that re&s;pectful &s;tyle. Henrietta, &s;uppo|&s;ing he did not know her rank in his family, re|plied,</P>
<P><Q>I expect my lady will ring every moment, &s;ir.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray let her know that I am come to break|fa&s;t with her,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Autumn.</P>
<P>Henrietta went immediately into her lady's chamber, and, finding her awake, delivered her me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>"Lord ble&s;s me!" &s;aid Mrs. Autumn,
<Q>what new whim is this? He does not u&s;e to invade my apartment in a morning: I &s;uppo&s;e he is come to teaze me with &s;ome of his jealous fancies. Well, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, order
<PB N="130" REF="137">
breakfa&s;t to be &s;ent in, and come to me di|rectly.</Q></P>
<P>What a ridiculous woman is this, thought Henrietta,, as &s;he went out of the room, to tor|ment, her&s;elf at her age with the notion of her hu&s;band being jealous of her.</P>
<P>The good lady, when &s;he returned, charged her not to leave the room while they were at breakfa&s;t.
<Q>Your pre&s;ence (&s;aid &s;he) may per|haps be &s;ome re&s;traint upon him.</Q></P>
<P>She then &s;lipped on a night-gown, and went in a frightful di&s;habille to attend her complai&s;ant &s;pou&s;e; for &s;he was one of tho&s;e ladies who dre&s;s for every body but their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>Henrietta was not &s;orry that &s;he was directed to wait, for &s;he was extremely de&s;irous of know|ing whether her lady had any rea&s;on for the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he expre&s;&s;ed. Mr. Autumn's good humour and complai&s;ance &s;oon put that matter out of doubt; but Mrs. Autumn was re&s;olved to per&s;uade her maid that her hu&s;band was jealous, and laughing affectedly, cried,</P>
<P><Q>Well, don't be chagrined, Mr. Autumn, but I prote&s;t I dreamt of poor Langui&s;h la&s;t night.</Q></P>
<P>The hu&s;band &s;hook his head, winked at his wi&s;e, and pointed to Henrietta, as if he had
<PB N="131" REF="138">
&s;aid, don't expo&s;e your&s;elf before your new &s;er|vant.</P>
<P>"Why, how you frown now!" pur&s;ued Mrs. Autumn;
<Q>I knew you would be angry. Lord! what does it &s;ignify of whom one dreams: one does not always think of the per&s;ons one dreams of. I wi&s;h I had not told you.</Q></P>
<P>"I wi&s;h you had not," &s;aid Mr. Autumn, biting his lip with vexation at her folly. The lady then lowering her voice, as if &s;he was not willing to be heard by Henrietta, tho' &s;he took care not to make it impo&s;&s;ible, repeated,
<Q><L>"Trifles, light as air,</L>
<L>"Are to the jealous, confirmations &s;trong</L>
<L>"As proofs of holy writ."</L></Q></P>
<P>"You are well read in Shake&s;pear, madam," &s;aid Mr. Autumn, who was willing to give an|other turn to the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"Oh!" exclaimed &s;he,
<Q>he has touched the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y finely in his character of Othello; I think the Moor was unea&s;y about a dream too.</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then &s;omebody tapped at the door, Hen|rietta opened it; one of the footmen delivered a me&s;&s;age from one lady, enquiring how Mrs. Au|tumn did, and a &s;ealed-up card from another.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="139">While the &s;ervant was &s;peaking, Mrs. Au|tumn called out, what makes the fellow whi&s;per in that manner, as if the me&s;&s;age he brings was a &s;ecret? Henrietta delivered her the card, which &s;he threw upon the table without open|ing it.
<Q>I am re&s;olved (&s;aid &s;he) to turn that blockhead away; his my&s;terious manner is enough to put &s;trange fancies into people's heads.</Q></P>
<P>"The &s;trange fancies are all your own," &s;aid Mr. Autumn, peevi&s;hly.</P>
<P>"I thought it would be &s;o," cried the lady,
<Q>you are out of humour. What is this &s;ealed up card the grievance? come, we will open it, and you &s;hall know the contents.</Q></P>

<Q>I have not the lea&s;t curio&s;ity about the con|tents&mdash;Good morning to you, my dear, I am going out.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, Ben&s;on," &s;aid Mrs. Autumn, as &s;oon as her hu&s;band had left the room;
<Q>is not this a comfortable life I live? what a pa&s;&s;ion that poor man is in!</Q></P>
<P>"Was Mr. Autumn angry, madam?" &s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure he was," &s;aid the lady;

<P><PB N="133" REF="140">"Indeed, madam," replied Henrietta,

<P><Q>I never will mention it, madam, to any body,</Q>
replied Henrietta.</P>
<P>"Nay, for that matter," &s;aid Mrs. Autumn,
<Q>you might mention it without any bad inten|tion, by way of pitying me, or &s;o; and per|haps I &s;hould not think the wor&s;e of you. But if you can be &s;ilent, Ben&s;on, you will oblige me; reports of this kind, you know, &s;hould not be circulated.</Q></P>
<P>"They never &s;hall by me, madam," &s;aid Hen|rietta.</P>
<P>"Enough, enough," cried Mrs. Autumn, ha&s;tily; "I hate long &s;peeches."</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Gives the reader hopes of a favourable change in the circum&s;tances of our fair here&s;ie.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta had exerci&s;ed her patience for &s;ome weeks in the &s;ervice of Mrs. Au|tumn; but every day producing new in&s;tances of her folly, &s;he re&s;olved to quit her as &s;oon as the counte&s;s came to town. She conceived &s;he was in &s;ome degree accountable to that lady for her actions, &s;ince it was through her recom|mendation, that &s;he had been introduced to Mrs. Autumn; and &s;he thought it necce&s;&s;ary for the ju&s;tification of her conduct, to have &s;o con&s;iderable a witne&s;s of its being irreproach|able.</P>
<P>Her lady, though &s;he found her&s;elf always di&s;appointed in that complai&s;ance to her whims which &s;he endeavoured to exact from her, yet ventured to make her a propo&s;al, which her own want of delicacy hindered her from &s;eeing the impropriety of.</P>
<P>She had taken it into her head to try her &s;up|po&s;ed lover's con&s;tancy, and therefore wrote a letter to him, in the character of a lady un|known,
<PB N="135" REF="142">
on who&s;e heart he had made a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion, but who was re&s;olved not to di&s;cover her&s;elf till &s;he knew whether his was wholly di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>This letter, &s;he doubted not, would produce a declaration that would afford matter of great triumph to her&s;elf, who &s;he &s;u&s;pected was the &s;ecret object of his adoration.</P>
<P>She acquainted her woman with her &s;cheme, and gravely de&s;ired her to copy the letter, for Langui&s;h, &s;he &s;aid, knew her hand.</P>
<P>Henrietta blu&s;hed with &s;urpri&s;e and &s;hame at this improper reque&s;t, and very frankly begged to be excu&s;ed from complying with it.</P>
<P>"What!" &s;aid Mrs. Autumn, a little con|fu&s;ed; "you di&s;pute my commands then!"</P>
<P><Q>I never refu&s;ed to obey any of your com|mands before, madam,</Q>
replied Henrietta;
<Q>but this, pardon me, madam, appears &s;o &s;trange.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You do not dare to &s;u&s;pect my virtue, I hope,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Autumn, in a lofty ac|cent.</P>
<P>"It does not become me, madam," &s;aid Hen|rietta, "to cen&s;ure your actions."</P>
<P>"No, certainly," replied the lady,
<Q>nor to refu&s;e to do any thing that I order you to do: but I would fain know if you, in your great

wi&s;dom, think there is anything improper in this little piece of gallantry.</Q></P>
<P>"My opinion is of no con&s;equence, madam," replied Henrietta;
<Q>I only beg to be excu&s;ed from copying it.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, no more of the letter." cried Mrs. Autumn, ha&s;tily:
<Q>perhaps I had only a mind to try your di&s;cretion; perhaps too I &s;hall like you the better for your &s;teadine&s;s&mdash; Be mode&s;t and re&s;erved, and you will be &s;ure of my approbation. Were you the be&s;t &s;ervant in the world, you would not do for me, un|le&s;s you were extremely mode&s;t. And now you know my mind, be cautious how you be|have: mode&s;ty is a &s;ure recommendation to my favour; I can pardon any fault in my &s;er|vant but want of mode&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, from this declaration, had rea&s;on to think her&s;elf pretty &s;ure of her lady's favour: for the &s;evere&s;t prude that ever declaimed again&s;t the mon&s;trous levity of her own &s;ex, could not have objected to the propriety of her behaviour; but, unhappily for her, &s;he was that very day guilty of a fault by which &s;he incurred very &s;hocking &s;u&s;picions: for having neglected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill her lady's &s;melling-bottle with &s;ome fre&s;h Eau de Luce, Mrs. Autumn declared that &s;uch heed|le&s;&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily proceed from her hav|ing

her thoughts continually employed upon fel|lows; and telling her, that &s;he could not endure &s;uch a creature in her &s;ight, ordered her to be gone immediately.</P>
<P>Henrietta did not think proper to offer any an&s;wer to this &s;trange charge; but quitting her pre&s;ence immediately, and her hou&s;e a few mo|ments afterwards, &s;he returned to Mrs. Willis, who, &s;eeing her alight at her door, eagerly flew to receive her.</P>
<P>"I have great news for you, my dear mi&s;s," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>I was this moment preparing to &s;et out in a coach to bring you a letter, which was left here by one of your uncle's &s;ervants. It is very true,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;eeing Henrietta looked &s;urpri&s;ed.
<Q>I a&s;ked the young man, who he came from? and he &s;aid, the earl of &mdash;. You may believe I am impatient to know the contents of this letter. Come, my dear, and read it; I hope all your troubles are over now.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta receiving the letter from her, which &s;he took out of her pocket, followed her into the parlour, and breaking the &s;eal,</P>
<P><Q>It is my uncle's hand, indeed (&s;aid &s;he) and this is what he writes.</Q></P>

<P>"Did I not tell you, mi&s;s," &s;aid Mrs. Willis, exultingly,
<Q>that the &s;tep you had taken would produce a favourable change in your fortune?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Don't be too &s;anguine in your expectations, my dear Mrs. Willis,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney;

I have left Mrs. Autumn.</Q></P>
<P>She then related to her &s;ome circum&s;tances of that lady's extravagant folly, and the cau&s;e and manner of their parting, which, together with their comments on lord&mdash;'s me&s;&s;age, furni&s;hed them with matter &s;ufficient for di&s;cour&s;e during the remainder of that day: what happened to our fair heroine the next, will be found in the fol|lowing chapter.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>De&s;troys the expectations rai&s;ed by the foregoing chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta was at her uncle's hou&s;e exactly at the hour pre&s;cribed her; and, upon &s;ending in her name, was de&s;ired to walk into his lord&s;hip's library.</P>
<P>The earl was there to receive her: he had with him two of his daughters; but the&s;e young ladies withdrew immediately, after &s;aluting her in a very di&s;tant manner, which &s;he returned with equal re&s;erve and coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Courteney," &s;aid his lord&s;hip, as &s;oon as they were alone,
<Q>I have been extremely angry with you for leaving your aunt in the &s;trange manner you did.</Q></P>
<P>"I am extremely obliged to your lord&s;hip," replied Henrietta,
<Q>for taking &s;o much intere&s;t in any thing that concerns me.</Q></P>
<P>"You certainly acted very indi&s;creetly," &s;aid the earl;
<Q>but what is pa&s;t, cannot be helped. You have had the good luck to make your|&s;elf friends, notwith&s;tanding this wrong &s;tep.
<PB N="140" REF="147">
You have been at the counte&s;s of&mdash;'s &s;eat, I hear.</Q></P>
<P>"Yes, my lord," an&s;wered Henrietta:
<Q>I was there with&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"The counte&s;s is very much your friend," interrupted his lord&s;hip, ha&s;tily,
<Q>but her &s;on is more &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta blu&s;hed, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"I will not," pur&s;ued his lord&s;hip,
<Q>exa|mine into your motives for leaving lady Mea|dows; but I will, if po&s;&s;ible, accommodate matters between you, provided you will con|cur with me in my endeavours for that pur|po&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I de&s;ire nothing more earne&s;tly than to be reconciled to my aunt,</Q>
replied Henrietta.</P>
<P><Q>I believe it will be your own fault if you are not,</Q>
re&s;umed his lord&s;hip;
<Q>and if you reco|ver her &s;avour, your good fortune will not &s;top there&mdash;To keep you no longer in &s;u&s;pence then, lord B&mdash; has declared a pa&s;&s;ion for you, and has &s;olicited my intere&s;t towards ef|fecting a reconciliation between your aunt and you, that he may pay his addre&s;&s;es to you in a proper manner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;urpri&s;ed that lord B&mdash; &s;hould make &s;uch a propo&s;al,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>he is en|gaged to the daughter of a rich citizen.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="148">"No, not engaged," replied the earl;
<Q>the match has been propo&s;ed, and he has vi&s;ited the young woman.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed, my lord," replied Henrietta,
<Q>the affair is much further advanced.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, well," interrupted his lord&s;hip,
<Q>we will &s;uppo&s;e that the writings are drawn and every thing &s;ettled; but they are not married, nor engaged neither.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His inclinations, you find, have taken an|other turn: you have no rea&s;on to blame him for this, I am &s;ure; and it would be &s;trange indeed if a man of his rank and fortune was to mind the cen&s;ures of the vulgar.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta was &s;ilent. His lord&s;hip pro|ceeded,</P>
<P><Q>Lord B&mdash; will find it difficult, no doubt, to prevail upon the earl to break off this treaty, and con&s;ent to his marrying you, though lady Meadows &s;hould offer to make you her heir; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e your fortune would be greatly below that of this citizen, whom he has cho&s;e for him. Neverthele&s;s, he does not de&s;pair of effecting this, provided your aunt will do for you what it was expected &s;he would before you was &s;o unhappy as to di&s;oblige her. In this lord B&mdash; &s;ufficiently
<PB N="142" REF="149">
&s;hews the &s;incerity and ardor of his pa&s;&s;ion, it is your part now to convince him that you are not ungrateful.</Q></P>
<P>"What would your lord&s;hip have me to do?" &s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P>"I would have you &s;ubmit to your aunt," &s;aid the earl,
<Q>and regain her affection, if po&s;&s;ible&punc; Lord B&mdash; has rea&s;on to expect this com|pliance from you.</Q></P>
<P>"I will do every thing I ought to do," re|plied Henrietta,
<Q>to recover my aunt's fa|vour, and this without any view to lord B&mdash; offers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, we &s;hall not examine too nicely into that matter,</Q>
interrupted his lord&s;hip &s;miling.
<Q>All that remains to be done, is this I will &s;ee lady Meadows my&s;elf, &s;he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in town &s;oon, I &s;uppo&s;e; lord B&mdash;'s pro|po&s;al, which I will acquaint her with, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> captivate her attention, and be your be&s;t ju&s;|tification.

<P>"There are certain conce&s;&s;ions, however &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>which it is impo&s;&s;ible for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to make, and which, if my aunt in&s;i&s;ts up as the nece&s;&s;ary conditions of a reconciliation between us, I mu&s;t &s;till continue under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P><Q>I am afraid you are going to &s;ay &s;ome &s;illy thing or other,</Q>
interrupted his lord&s;hip, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat; which motion Henrietta under&s;tanding as a hint for her to ha&s;ten her de|parture, ro&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P>"I will detain your lord&s;hip no longer," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>than ju&s;t to tell you that &s;ome time ago my aunt propo&s;ed to me to &s;ettle all her fortune upon me, provided I would embrace the Ro|man catholick religion.</Q></P>
<P>"A noble offer, upon my honour!" &s;aid his lord&s;hip, "and did you refu&s;e it?"</P>
<P><Q>Would your lord&s;hip have had me accept of it?</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P><Q>What &s;ignifies what I would have had you do,</Q>
replied the earl, peevi&s;hly.
<Q>What did the con&s;ideration of your own intere&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;t to you?</Q></P>
<P>"To refu&s;e it, my lord," an&s;wered Henrietta, "and I did &s;o."</P>
<P>"I find you are a very romantick girl," &s;aid his lord&s;hip;
<Q>I am re&s;olved to trouble my&s;elf no more about your affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I hope it will not be imputed to me as a crime,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>that I could not be bribed to change my religion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="151">"Change your religion!" repeated the earl,
<Q>what nece&s;&s;ity was there for your changing your religion: you might have humoured the old woman, have gone with her to ma&s;s, and conformed to &s;ome of her &s;uper|&s;titious ceremonies, and be a good prote&s;tant in your heart notwith&s;tanding; the world, knowing your motives, would have com|mended you for &s;uch a prudent conduct&mdash;I &s;ee there is nothing to be done with you,</Q>
pur&s;ued he, after a little pau&s;e.
<Q>For the &s;ake of the unfortunate man, who was your fa|ther, I would have been glad to have &s;een you well married; but lord B&mdash; is not &s;uch a fool as to take you without a fortune; and as you cannot rea&s;onably have any expec|tations but from lady Meadows, who has no children, and may leave her fortune to whom &s;he plea&s;es, without doing any body inju&s;tice, you know be&s;t whether it is worth your while to make a proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her or not.</Q></P>
<P>"I will never make an improper one," &s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure," &s;aid his lord&s;hip,
<Q>your own wi&s;dom is to be judge of that.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="152">"No, my lord," replied Henrietta;
<Q>you &s;hall if you plea&s;e be judge&mdash; if my con|&s;cience&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray, let me hear nothing about your con|&s;cience,</Q>
interrupted the earl;
<Q>it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to let matters even between you and your con&s;cience: your aunt's popi&s;h confe&s;&s;or, who is likely to be her heir, is &s;kilful in tho&s;e things; yet I would not advi&s;e you to con&s;ult him neither, for he is an intere&s;ted per&s;on: but remember, that you may either &s;ecure to your&s;elf a good e&s;tate, and marry a very de|&s;erving young nobleman, or continue in the ob&s;curity and want your father left you in, which is all the legacy he bequeathed you. Think well of this, and then let your con|&s;cience determine, I do not advi&s;e you to do any thing again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P>"My re&s;olution is already fixed," &s;aid Hen|rietta;
<Q>my con&s;cience will neither permit me to change my religion, nor to counterfeit a change of it.</Q></P>
<P>"Do you in&s;inuate by that," &s;aid his lord|&s;hip, ha&s;tily,
<Q>that I advi&s;ed you to do either the one or the other?</Q></P>
<P>"My aunt already knows my mind," &s;aid Henrietta, evading a que&s;tion which &s;he could
<PB N="146" REF="153">
not an&s;wer truly without offending him;
<Q>I have nothing to hope for from your lord&s;hip's interpo&s;ition, unle&s;s &s;he has been plea&s;ed to give up this point; and I &s;hall chearfully re|turn to that poverty my father bequeathed me, &s;ince with it he bequeathed me piety and virtue.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is a pity he did not leave you prudence al&s;o,</Q>
&s;aid the earl, who found &s;omething very provoking in this la&s;t &s;peech,
<Q>you would not then have di&s;obliged your aunt by you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;candalous elopement from her, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reduced you to the mi&s;erable condition you are now in, &s;o that your friends know no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> how to take notice of you.</Q></P>
<P>"Friends! my lord," replied Henrietta, ri&s;ing in her temper;
<Q>I have no friends, I have only relations.</Q></P>
<P>"That is likely to be their mi&s;fortune," &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his lord&s;hip, who was very angry at this &s;arca&s;m
<Q>your undutifulne&s;s to your aunt makes you unworthy of the notice of your relations and I declare to you plainly, that from the moment I will never concern my&s;elf abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> you.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta di&s;dained to make any an&s;wer this unju&s;t and cruel &s;peech; but courtefied
<PB N="147" REF="154">
&s;ilence, and withdrew? leaving the earl very well &s;atisfied with him&s;elf for the tender and pa|rental part he had acted towards his brother's daughter, and furni&s;hed with excellent rea&s;ons for never &s;eeing her more.</P>
<P>"I had provided a match for her," &s;aid he, that very evening, to an humble friend, who he knew would not fail to &s;pread the report,
<Q>not unworthy of a daughter of my own. She rejected my propo&s;al. She refu&s;ed to make any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her aunt, whom I would have prevailed upon to be reconciled to her. Let her &s;uffer the con&s;equences of her ob&s;ti|nacy and folly; I have done all that I ought to do, and am ju&s;tified to the world.</Q></P>
<P>His lord&s;hip forgot to add, that the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which was expected from her was nothing more than the change of her religion, and the match &s;he &s;o ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, could not be effected without &s;he purcha&s;ed a fortune by an impious hypocri&s;y. Neverthele&s;s the omi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e trifling circum&s;tances gave &s;uch a colour to Hen|rietta's behaviour, that &s;he was con&s;idered by all, who heard her uncle's account of it, as an unhappy young creature, who would ruin her|&s;elf, and be the blot of a noble family.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="155">As for our fair heroine, &s;he fore&s;aw that her uncle would ju&s;tify his neglect of her at her expence. She had every thing again&s;t her; rank, fortune, power; that general prejudice which prevails again&s;t the unfortunate, and that as general &s;ervility which adopts the pa&s;&s;ions of the great. But the&s;e reflections filled her with no unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions; for there is this ad|vantage in virtue, that it is &s;ufficient for it|&s;elf, and needs not the applau&s;e or &s;upport of others, its own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is its be&s;t re|ward.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which lord B&mdash;&s;hews him&s;elf a true modern lover.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta, before &s;he went home, waited upon lady D&mdash;, to acquaint her that &s;he had left Mrs. Autumn. She avoided mention|ing that lady's peculiarities which had made it impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e her; but with great &s;impli|city related the error &s;he had been guilty of, and the &s;u&s;picions &s;he had incurred by it, which oc|ca&s;ioned her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="156">Lady D&mdash; diverted her&s;elf for &s;ome time with the extreme delicacy of her whim&s;ical friend, and then told Henrietta, that having &s;till a good opinion of her prudence and mo|de&s;ty, notwith&s;tanding the rea&s;ons Mrs. Au|tumn had to &s;u&s;pect her, &s;he would place her about a young lady, a relation of her own.</P>
<P>Henrietta thanked her in very re&s;pectful terms, and took her leave, after &s;he had, at lady D&mdash;'s de&s;ire, left her a direction to her lodgings, that &s;he might know where to &s;end for her when it was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>At her return, &s;he found the faithful Mrs. Willis full of anxious impatience to hear the &s;ucce&s;s of her vi&s;it to the earl. Henrietta, thro' re&s;pect to her uncle, concealed the greate&s;t part of his di&s;cour&s;e to her, but owned that &s;he had no expectations from him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis &s;hrugged up her &s;houlders:
<Q>Then it was as you &s;u&s;pected (&s;aid &s;he) your uncle has propo&s;ed &s;ome ab&s;urd match to you, and you have forfeited his future fa|vour by not complying with it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that lord B&mdash; has made an application to my uncle,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P>"Surpri&s;ed!" repeated Mrs. Willis;
<Q>why, to be &s;ure, con&s;idering how your affairs are
<PB N="150" REF="157">
circum&s;tanced, this is a generous way of proceeding. Well, I hope you begin now to have a favourable opinion both of his love and honour.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;ure I think highly of his prudence," replied Henrietta, &s;miling:
<Q>only mark the caution with which he acts in this affair; my poverty gave him hopes that I &s;hould be an ea&s;y conque&s;t, and that pa&s;&s;ion which fir&s;t manife&s;ted it&s;elf in an open attempt upon my honour, &s;ought afterwards to allure me with bribes. It is not &s;trange that per&s;ons who hold money to be the greate&s;t good, &s;hould think it more than an equivalent for virtue. Here, however, he was di&s;appointed again, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, no doubt, and mar|riage is this honourable lover's la&s;t re&s;ource; but this he does not offer till he is &s;ure I &s;hall have a fortune, if not equal to that of my rival the packer's daughter, yet at lea&s;t &s;uf|ficient to ju&s;tify his choice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> opinion of the prudential part of the world: and per|haps he expects I &s;hould purcha&s;e the mighty ble&s;&s;ing of his hand by the &s;acrifice, the tem|porary &s;acrifice at lea&s;t of tho&s;e principles, for which I have already &s;uffered &s;o much.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="158">
<Q>Have you any rea&s;on for this &s;hocking &s;u&s;|picion?</Q>
interrupted Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>"I think I have," replied Henrietta:
<Q>a reconciliation with my aunt is, it &s;eems, a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary to his addre&s;&s;es; and yet he heard from my&s;elf upon what condi|tion that reconciliation could only be effect|ed.</Q>
Henrietta, &s;uddenly interrupting her|&s;elf, cried out,
<Q>There he is; there is lord B&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>"Where? where?" &s;aid Mrs. Willis, run|ning to the window. "It is certainly he," &s;aid Henrietta, "he pa&s;&s;ed by in a chair.</P>
<P>That in&s;tant they heard a loud rap at the door.</P>
<P>"As I live," cried Mrs. Willis (in a violent flutter)
<Q>he is come to vi&s;it you. I hope you will &s;ee him, mi&s;s Courteney; hear what he has to &s;ay, pray do; there can be no harm in that, I am &s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, well," &s;aid Henrietta, &s;miling at her &s;olicitude;
<Q>I will &s;ee him; let him be &s;hewn into the other parlour, if you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Willis, curious to &s;ee this young lord, went her&s;elf to open the door. He bolted out of the chair; and, with a look and accent full of impatience, a&s;ked her, if the young lady that lodged there was at home?"</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="159">"Mi&s;s Courteney, &s;ir?" &s;aid Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied he, ha&s;tily;
<Q>is &s;he at home, can I &s;ee her? Pray tell her a gentleman from &mdash;, enquires for her.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Willis de&s;ired him to walk into the par|lour, &s;aid &s;he would acquaint the young lady with his being there; and a few moments after|wards Henrietta appeared.</P>
<P>Lord B&mdash; flew to meet her, with the air of a lover con&s;cious of the right he had to be well received; and, taking her hand, which he re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ed,</P>
<P>"Now," cried he, exultingly,
<Q>can you doubt the ardor of my pa&s;&s;ion for you? and will you not at length confe&s;s that it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to de&s;erve you?</Q></P>
<P>"Certainly; my lord," replied Henrietta, "it is very po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P><Q>May I peri&s;h if I think &s;o (&s;aid he) but how poorly would words expre&s;s my adora|tion of you. Judge of the purity, the ardor of my love, by what I have done to make you mine&mdash;Have you not &s;een your uncle, mi&s;s Courteney?</Q></P>
<P>"I have, my lord," replied Henrietta.</P>
<P>"You have!" repeated his lord&s;hip;
<Q>and in that grave cold accent too. Surely my &s;entiments and de&s;igns are &s;till unknown to
<PB N="153" REF="160">
you: it is impo&s;&s;ible el&s;e that you &s;hould be thus in&s;en&s;ible, nay ungrateful, I will &s;ay&mdash; for I have given no common proofs of love, I think.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed, my lord," replied Henrietta, who had a mind to teaze this generous lover a little,
<Q>you &s;hall not &s;uffer for your noble di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s&mdash; you &s;hall not relinqui&s;h mi&s;s Cord|wain and her immen&s;e fortune for me.</Q></P>
<P>"Name not her fortune," cried lord B&mdash;; "were it millions I would refu&s;e it for you."</P>
<P><Q>Nay, now your lord&s;hip is quite roman|tick,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>to prefer to a rich heire&s;s an unhappy young woman, de&s;erted by her relations, and reduced to &s;eek a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence by her labour.</Q></P>
<P>"Call not my pa&s;&s;ion romantick," inter|rupted lord B&mdash;,
<Q>becau&s;e it &s;oars above common conceptions: a mind &s;o elevated as your's might give it a ju&s;ter epithet.</Q></P>
<P>"Were my aunt," pur&s;ued Henrietta,
<Q>to leave me her whole e&s;tate, you would &s;till make no incon&s;iderable &s;acrifice by quitting mi&s;s Cordwain for me, &s;ince my fortune would then be greatly inferior to her's. But you know, my lord, I have no expectations from lady Meadows: I have declared to my

<P>"To be &s;ure, madam," &s;aid lord B&mdash;, who&s;e countenance expre&s;&s;ed at once &s;urpri&s;e, confu&s;ion, and di&s;appointment&mdash;
<Q>I did apply to the earl, not per&s;onally indeed. I con|trived it &s;o that a friend of mine, who is very intimate with his lord&s;hip, &s;hould give him a hint of your &s;ituation, and the &s;entiments I entertained for you: and, from the ac|count my friend gave me of his &s;ucce&s;s in his negotiation, I conceived that you might be prevailed upon&mdash;that is, that you would con|&s;ider&mdash; For might I not hope, my dear mi&s;s Courteney, that you would not be in&s;en&s;ible of my affection.</Q></P>

<Q>I &s;ee (re&s;umed he) that I have not been happy enough to in&s;pire you with any tender &s;entiments for me.

<Q>do I not do ju&s;tice to your birth, your beauty and virtue, by my pre&s;ent honourable intentions?</Q></P>
<P>"It is not enough for me, my lord," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>that your intentions are honour|able now; to have merited my e&s;teem, they &s;hould always have been &s;o: but, to &s;peak plainly, I am &s;till doubtful of your inten|tions.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="163">"Doubtful &s;till of my intentions!" repeated lord B&mdash;:
<Q>have I not declared them to your uncle, madam? have I not &s;olicited his in|tere&s;t with you?</Q></P>

<Q>and that it has all the weight with me you could wi&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>"Why then we &s;hall be happy, my angel," cried he, taking her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips.
<Q>You will be reconciled to your aunt, and I may hope for my father's con&s;ent to our union.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A reconciliation with my aunt is impo&s;|&s;ible,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta, withdrawing her hand.</P>
<P>"Say not that it is impo&s;&s;ible," replied lord B&mdash;,
<Q>but that you have not complai&s;ance enough for me, to attempt it.</Q></P>
<P>"Did I not know it to be impo&s;&s;ible," re|&s;umed Henrietta,
<Q>I would attempt it for my own &s;ake; but nothing le&s;s than the &s;acri|fice of my religion will &s;ati&s;fy my aunt: on this condition indeed &s;he promi&s;es to &s;ettle her whole e&s;tate upon me; I think I once told your lord&s;hip &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>"You did, my dear mi&s;s Courteney," inter|rupted lord B&mdash;;
<Q>and I adore you for your &s;teady adherence to your principles.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="164">Henrietta was a little &s;tartled at &s;o unexpected a declaration; but lord B&mdash;did not &s;uffer her to remain long in the error his la&s;t words had occa&s;ioned.</P>

<Q>excu&s;e my freedom, mi&s;s, we might expect that &s;he would receive my pro|po&s;als with plea&s;ure, and make &s;uch conce&s;|&s;ions in favour of her niece, as might en|gage my father's con&s;ent to our marriage: but &s;ince this is hopele&s;s, is it rea&s;onable that you &s;hould be the victim of her ob&s;tinacy? by &s;eeming only to comply with your aunt's de|&s;ires, all ob&s;tacles to our union will be re|moved; a temporary compliance is all that is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure to you a fortune, and a rank in life &s;uitable to your birth. Do not imagine that I wi&s;h to &s;ee you a pro&s;elyte to the religion &s;he profe&s;&s;es: no, if any thing could weaken my pa&s;&s;ion, your being capable of &s;uch a change, upon intere&s;ted motives, would do it.

<P>"Then, to be &s;ure, my lord," replied Hen|rietta,
<Q>you think that a little di&s;&s;imulation in this ca&s;e would be a virtue.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="165">"In your circum&s;tances," re&s;umed lord B&mdash;,
<Q>it certainly would; for while your principles are unchanged, what do you &s;acrifice, in yielding to your aunt, but externals only? this &s;acrifice your intere&s;t, your happine&s;s de|mands of you; let me add al&s;o that you owe it to a man who loves you with the ardor I do. And &s;urely, to indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;eek occa|&s;ions of &s;uffering for a religion, which, if you could be contented with &s;ecretly profe&s;&s;ing, you would be happy your&s;elf, and make o|thers happy al&s;o, is to give the world rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that o&s;tentation has a greater &s;hare in your re&s;olves than piety. Therefore, my dear mi&s;s Courteney, you &s;ee it is not the &s;acrifice of your religion that I require of you, but of the reputation of &s;uffering for it.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, my lord," replied Henrietta, who had li&s;tened to him with great calmne&s;s,
<Q>if ever I was in doubt of your intentions, you have clearly explained them now; of them, and of the &s;entiments you have avowed, you may collect my opinion, when I declare to you, that if you had worlds to be&s;tow on me, I would not be your wife.</Q></P>
<P>"Is this your re&s;olution, mi&s;s Courteney?" &s;aid his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166">
<Q>It is, my lord (&s;he replied). A re&s;olution ju&s;tifiable upon your own great principle in|tere&s;t.

<P>"Hold, madam, hold," interrupted lord B&mdash;,
<Q>this is too much: I have not de&s;erved this treatment, but I thank you for it; yes, from my &s;oul I thank you for it: it has helped to re&s;tore my &s;en&s;es; I have been fooli&s;h, very fooli&s;h, I confe&s;s.</Q></P>

<P>Henrietta courtefied gravely without an&s;wer|ing him; and having rung the bell for a &s;ervant to attend him to the door, went into the room

where her friend was &s;itting.

<P>It is &s;o difficult for mean and &s;elfi&s;h per&s;ons to conceive that any thing but private advantage can influence the re&s;olutions of others, that not|with&s;tanding the proof Henrietta had given of her attachment to her religion, and her invio|lable regard to truth, yet &s;till lord B&mdash; &s;up|po&s;ed there mu&s;t be &s;ome other latent motive for a conduct, in his opinion, highly ridiculous, and very incon&s;i&s;tent with that good &s;en&s;e which it was apparent &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sometimes he fancied he had a rival; and then, to clear a doubt &s;o tormenting, he was upon the point of returning to her to offer her his hand upon her own conditions: but his avarice re&s;trained him from making &s;o dan|gerous
<PB N="161" REF="168">
a trial: &s;he might accept his offer; and with all the pa&s;&s;ion he felt for her, he could not re&s;olve to marry her without a fortune.</P>
<P>To &s;tifle a thought which &s;ugge&s;ted to him de&s;igns &s;o de&s;tructive to his intere&s;t, he endea|voured to per&s;uade him&s;elf that her ob&s;tinacy, in refu&s;ing to temporize a little when &s;uch mighty advantages were in view, was the effect of female vanity, which &s;ought di&s;tinction at the expence of &s;olid happine&s;s. In this opinion he was confirmed by his friend, whom he had employed to &s;ound the earl her uncle with re|gard to his propo&s;als, and to whom he now communicated the re&s;ult of his interview with Henrietta.</P>
<P>"Depend upon it," &s;aid this &s;agacious per|&s;on,
<Q>your godde&s;s will de&s;cend from her ro|mantick flights, when &s;he finds &s;he has almo&s;t &s;oared out of human ken; and is much more likely to be laughed at for her extravagant folly, than admired and applauded for her ex|traordinary piety. Follow my advice (pur|&s;ued he) &s;uffer your mi&s;tre&s;s to believe you have broke her chains; if intere&s;t does not make her wi&s;h to recall you, vanity will.

<P>Lord B&mdash;improved a little upon his friend's &s;cheme, and re&s;olved to continue his addre&s;&s;es to mi&s;s Cordwain, to pique Henrietta, he &s;aid; but in reality, he was as much in love with the fortune of that young lady, as with the per&s;on of our fair heroine; and was not willing to ha|zard the lo&s;s of the one, while it was yet doubt|ful whether he &s;hould ever po&s;&s;e&s;s the other.</P>

<P><Q>If I thought &s;uch an application would be &s;ucce&s;sful,</Q>
replied Henrietta,
<Q>I would rea|dily con&s;ent to it. For you may ea&s;ily ima|gine, my dear Mrs. Willis, that this low condition is not my choice: but I know my aunt's temper; whatever &s;he de&s;ires, &s;he de|&s;ires with ardor; and makes a merit at per|&s;i&s;ting ob&s;tinately in a re&s;olution &s;he has once formed. Her pride will be a more powerful advocate for me, than any thing the coun|te&s;s can urge; to that I formerly owed my deliverance from dependence, more mortify|ing than &s;ervitude. This pride will no doubt be &s;en&s;ibly wounded, when &s;he finds that I am determined in my choice; if any thing can make her recede from her purpo&s;e, it will be the &s;hame of &s;eeing her niece reduced &s;o low. But &s;urely it is not the way to con|vince her I am really determined, if I allow my friends to teaze her with &s;olicitations, when &s;he has already declared her re&s;olution in &s;uch &s;trong terms: &s;he will believe that I have engaged them to make this trial; &s;he will be offended with their interpo&s;ition, and
<PB N="164" REF="171">
perhaps be the le&s;s inclined to rai&s;e me from this ob&s;cure condition, as &s;he will not have the merit of doing it from her own genero&s;ity and tenderne&s;s, but at the in&s;tances of others: time only, my dear Mrs. Willis, can produce any favourable change in my circum&s;tances; it will either &s;often the hearts of my relations, or it will blunt my &s;en&s;e of the meanne&s;s of my condition, by familiarizing me to it. This I am &s;ure of at lea&s;t, that, in the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of doing right, I &s;hall always find an un|failing &s;ource of happine&s;s, however Provi|dence may think fit to di&s;po&s;e of me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, never doubt but you are the care of Providence, my dear mi&s;s,</Q>
cried Mrs. Willis,
<Q>&s;uch virtue and piety mu&s;t &s;ooner or later be happy: Heaven and your own prudence di|rect you.</Q></P>
<P>"I have not always been prudent," &s;aid Hen|rietta, &s;ighing;
<Q>but misfortunes, as you once told me, teach us wi&s;dom.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Willis, ob&s;erving an unu&s;ual pen&s;ivene&s;s &s;tealing over the &s;weet features of Henrietta or this reflection, changed the di&s;cour&s;e to a le&s;s intere&s;ting &s;ubject, and employed her utmo&s;t a&s;|&s;iduity and tenderne&s;s to make the time &s;he &s;tayed with her pa&s;s agreeably.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="172">A week being elap&s;ed, and no me&s;&s;age com|ing from lady D&mdash;, Henrietta began to apprehend that &s;he &s;hould be di&s;appointed of a place, in which &s;he expected more &s;atisfaction than &s;he had found in tho&s;e &s;he had hitherto been in, when &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed with a vi&s;it from the counte&s;s of&mdash;.</P>

<P><Q>I have no rea&s;on to think they have, ma|dam, replied Henrietta.</Q></P>
<P>"Shocking in&s;en&s;ibility!" exclaimed the counte&s;s, lifting up her eyes;
<Q>you have been very ill u&s;ed too by Mrs. Autumn, my &s;i&s;ter tells me.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta &s;miled, but was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Well, mi&s;s Courteney," re&s;umed the coun|te&s;s,
<Q>will you come and live with me as my friend and companion. I know your generous &s;corn of dependence; but it is the unworthi|ne&s;s of the donor only, that can make benefits &s;it heavy on a mind like your's: there is often as much greatne&s;s of &s;oul in receiving
<PB N="166" REF="173">
as in conferring benefits; and when true friend&s;hip is the motive for giving, it is pride, not genero&s;ity, to refu&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"Do me the ju&s;tice to believe&punc; madam," replied Henrietta,
<Q>that I receive this in&s;tance of your goodne&s;s with the deepe&s;t gratitude, but there is&mdash;</Q></P>

<Q>why do you imagine that I am &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of your merit&mdash;but you know, my good girl, lord B&mdash; is in honour engaged to mi&s;s Cord|wain.</Q></P>
<P>"His lord&s;hip's partiality for me," &s;aid Hen|rietta,
<Q>has induced him to carry this matter further than (as he is circum&s;tanced) I think he &s;hould have done. He has cau&s;ed my uncle to be applied to; but this has produced nothing, madam. I told lord B&mdash; upon what conditions my aunt had offered to &s;ettle her e&s;tate upon me; and his lord&s;hip is con|vinced that I cannot comply with them. My re&s;olution is fixed, my lord B&mdash; knows it is &s;o, and you have nothing to fear, madam, from any imprudence on his &s;ide, or any un|genero&s;ity on mine. I ventured to promi&s;e that I would de&s;erve the confidence you was plea&s;ed to place in me on this occa&s;ion, and I hope I have and &s;hall continue to de&s;erve it.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the delicate manner in which Henrietta &s;tated the affair between her and lord B&mdash;, yet the counte&s;s di&s;covered that her &s;on had &s;hewn more prudence than genero&s;ity, or

even love in his behaviour; and, by a &s;trange contradiction in the human heart, &s;he at once approved and condemned, was plea&s;ed with, yet a&s;hamed of his conduct; but charmed with Henrietta's noble di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, her candour and &s;incerity, &s;he embraced her with the ten|derne&s;s of a mother, and perhaps with the more tenderne&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he was not likely &s;he &s;hould not be her mother.</P>
<P><Q>I am impatient (&s;aid &s;he) till I can have you with me, that I may have it in my power to &s;hew you how greatly I both love and e&s;teem you.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta thanked her with great politene&s;s; and then told her of lady D&mdash;'s intentions to recommend her to a young lady, a relation of her's.</P>
<P>"Oh! mi&s;s Belmour, you mean," &s;aid the counte&s;s;
<Q>my &s;i&s;ter mentioned it to me: &s;he is an agreeable young woman, has a very good fortune, and is entirely mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf She will be much better plea&s;ed to receive you in the character of a companion that a &s;ervant, when &s;he knows your birth and merit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will owe obligations of that kind to non but your&s;elf, madam,</Q>
replied Henrietta
<Q>and I beg this young lady may know no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

of me than what is ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to recom|mend me to her good opinion as a &s;ervant.</Q></P>
<P>The counte&s;s conte&s;ted this point with her for &s;ome time; but finding her not to be di&s;&s;uaded from her de&s;ign, "Well!" &s;aid &s;he, kindly,
<Q>you &s;hall be indulged this once, but remember I claim your promi&s;e to come to me when a certain objection is removed; in the mean time we will &s;ettle you with mi&s;s Belmour in the way you chu&s;e.

<P>Henrietta &s;aid &s;he would not fail to attend lady D&mdash; Upon which the counte&s;s ro&s;e up, ki&s;&s;ed her at parting, and de&s;ired &s;he would look upon her as one of her mo&s;t faithful friends.</P>
<P>Our fair heroine had rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the kind manner in which lady D&mdash; recom|mended her to mi&s;s Belmour, as well as with the reception that young lady gave her. She carried her home with her in her coach, and behaved to her with an affability that Henrietta could no otherwi&s;e account for, than by &s;uppo&s;|&s;ing the counte&s;s had di&s;covered her true name and circum&s;tances to her.&mdash; In this, however, &s;he was mi&s;taken: her young mi&s;tre&s;s was in love; &s;he had occa&s;ion for a confidant. Hen|rietta's youth and gentlene&s;s promi&s;ed her &s;he

<P>Henrietta li&s;tened with complai&s;ance to the overflowings of a heart tender by nature, and wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as &s;he thought, by a de&s;erving object; but when mi&s;s Belmour, in the cour&s;e of frequent conver&s;ations on this exhau&s;tle&s;s theme, gave her to under&s;tand that this lover of whom &s;he boa&s;ted was the hu&s;band of another lady, from whom he had been parted &s;everal years, &s;urpri&s;e, horror, grief, were &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on her countenance, that her lady be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gan to repent of a confe&s;&s;ion &s;he had made, it full confidence that her &s;entiments, whatever they were, mu&s;t needs be approved by her &s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vant.</P>

<P><PB N="171" REF="178">She began with telling Henrietta, that Mr. Campley had when very young, been forced, by an avaricious father to marry a woman whom he could not love, and with whom he had been &s;o mi&s;erable, that a &s;eparation was agreed to by the relations on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Henrietta &s;ighed &s;ympathetically at this ac|count. Mi&s;s Belmour, encouraged by this mark of her &s;en&s;ibility, proceeded with great fluency of language, to expatiate on the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s power of love: her lover's &s;ophi&s;try had furni&s;hed her with arguments to prove, that the marriage he had been forced into was not binding in the &s;ight of heaven, and that he was at liberty to be&s;tow his affections el&s;ewhere. She treated marriage as a mere human in&s;titution, adopted the &s;enti|ments of Eloi&s;a, talked of a union of hearts, eternal con&s;tancy, generous confidence&mdash;Hen|rietta heard her with patience; but being out of breath at la&s;t, &s;he &s;topped, and &s;eemed to expect a reply.</P>
<P>Our fair heroine, with all the humility becom|ing her &s;tation, but at the &s;ame time with all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ne&s;s of virtue, oppo&s;ed the &s;pecious argu|ments &s;he had urged with others which rea&s;on, religion, and the purity of her own &s;entiments &s;ugge&s;ted to her: the&s;e, however, made very little impre&s;&s;ion on mi&s;s Belmour. She yawned,
<PB N="172" REF="179">
&s;miled contemptuou&s;ly, and was &s;everal times ready to interrupt her with an authoritative air, but refrained, from the con&s;ideration that her woman was now, by the participation of her &s;e|cret, become her companion, if not &s;omething more.</P>
<P>Henrietta, de&s;pairing to re&s;cue her unhappy mi&s;tre&s;s, by motives of piety, from the &s;nares that were laid for her, &s;ought even to intere&s;t her pa&s;&s;ions in the cau&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P><Q>You depend, madam (pur&s;ued &s;he) upon your lover's con&s;tancy; but what &s;ecurity can you have that he will be con&s;tant?</Q></P>
<P>"What &s;ecurity!" interrupted mi&s;s Belmour, rou&s;ed to attention by &s;o intere&s;ting a que&s;tion; "his vows."</P>
<P><Q>The&s;e vows, madam (&s;aid Henrietta) will expire with the pa&s;&s;ion that cau&s;ed them: he will be con&s;tant as long as he loves, but how long he will love, is the doubt.</Q></P>
<P>"I am really vain enough to imagine," re|plied mi&s;s Belmour, bridling,
<Q>that tho&s;e few attractions I have received from nature, &s;ince, they have gained, will fix his heart: I am quite free from any apprehen&s;ions of that &s;ort, I can a&s;&s;ure you.</Q></P>
<P>"You have charms, madam," &s;aid Henri|etta,
<Q>that entitle you to a worthier conque&s;t
<PB N="173" REF="180">
than of a man, who, not having it in his power to marry you, yet di&s;honourably &s;eeks to en&s;nare your affections.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is natural to wi&s;h to be beloved by tho&s;e we love,</Q>
replied mi&s;s Belmour:
<Q>I am convinced Mr. Campley loves me.</Q></P>
<P>"If he loved you &s;incerely, madam," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>he would not make you unhappy; true love never &s;eeks the ruin of its object: di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s is the te&s;t of love; try Mr. Campley's by that.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Campley has no mean, &s;elfi&s;h de&s;igns upon my fortune,</Q>
cried mi&s;s Belmour.</P>
<P><Q>His de&s;igns are mean and &s;elfi&s;h in the high|e&s;t degree,</Q>
replied Henrietta,
<Q>&s;ince he ex|pects that to make him happy you &s;hould &s;a|crifice your peace, your honour, and your re|putation; and &s;hould he &s;ucceed in the&s;e de|&s;igns, which heaven forbid, the neglect he will &s;oon treat you with will convince you, that love, when not founded on e&s;teem, cannot be la&s;ting: for the contempt which even li|bertines feel for tho&s;e whom they have &s;e|duced, is a proof of that &s;ecret homage which all men pay to virtue.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If I thought Mr. Campley would ever fail in the re&s;pect and adoration he pays me now,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Belmour, "I &s;hould hate him."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="181">
<Q>The only way to pre&s;erve that re&s;pect, madam,</Q>
replied Henrietta,
<Q>is not to al|low him to encourage any pre&s;umptuous hopes: if you wi&s;h to keep his heart, engage his e&s;teem; he may one time or other, per|haps, be at liberty to offer you his hand.</Q></P>
<P>"Ah, Henrietta!" interrupted mi&s;s Bel|mour, &s;ighing,
<Q>that time is very di&s;tant, I fear: but you have put &s;trange thoughts into my head; I have been to blame to &s;uffer Mr. Campley to talk to me &s;o freely of his pa&s;&s;ion: indeed I think he has been le&s;s re&s;pectful, &s;ince I &s;uffered him to perceive that I pre&s;er|ed him to all the men I ever &s;aw. I own to you freely that it was my apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing him that made me li&s;ten to his argu|ments; for I thought, if I reduced him to de&s;pair, he would conquer his pa&s;&s;ion for me: but what if the very means I have u&s;ed to keep his heart &s;hould prove the cau&s;e of his &s;lighting me!&mdash;Oh! you do not know what anxious, unea&s;y doubts you have rai&s;ed in my mind!&mdash;However, I am re&s;olved to behave with more re&s;erve to him for the future. I will try whether his pa&s;&s;ion is &s;trong enough to &s;ub&s;i&s;t of it&s;elf; for you have convinced me that the hopes with which I have hitherto fed it, have been le&s;s likely to nouri&s;h than to cloy.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="182">Henrietta would have been better plea&s;ed if &s;entiments more pure had &s;ugge&s;ted this de&s;ign; but it was a great point gained to prevail with her on any terms to di&s;courage the addre&s;&s;es of a man who&s;e love was a crime. She flattered her&s;elf likewi&s;e that this unexpected &s;everity in mi&s;s Belmour would produce an alteration in her unworthy lover's behaviour, which might favour her views of exciting her re&s;entment again&s;t him; and in this &s;he was not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Mr. Campley thought fit to be offended at the new plan of conduct mi&s;s Belmour had laid down for her&s;elf, and complained of it at fir&s;t with that mixture of haughtine&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which a man, who is &s;ure he is beloved, thinks he has a right to u&s;e; but, finding this had not the effect he de&s;ired, he had recour&s;e to a per|&s;onated indifference, in order to alarm her with the fear of lo&s;ing him.</P>
<P>Henrietta, whom &s;he acquainted with every change in his behaviour, told her that this was the time to humble her imperious lover.
<Q>You mu&s;t either give him laws, madam (&s;aid &s;he) or be contented to receive them of him: his aim was to degrade you to a mi&s;tre&s;s; he will love you, you &s;ee, upon no other condition.</Q></P>
<P>"I &s;ee it! I &s;ee it plainly!" interrupted mi&s;s Belmour, bur&s;ting into tears;
<Q>where is now
<PB N="176" REF="183">
that aweful love he profe&s;&s;ed for me, when a look, a &s;mile, was a &s;ufficient reward for all his &s;ufferings!&mdash;Dear Henrietta tell me what I &s;hall do to &s;hew him how much I hate and de&s;pi&s;e him.</Q></P>
<P>"Avoid him, madam, as much as po&s;&s;ible," replied Henrietta.
<Q>When you happen to meet him in company, &s;uffer him not to &s;peak to you apart, and receive no letters from him; per&s;i&s;t in this conduct, and you will convince him that you are re&s;olved not to purcha&s;e the continuance of his affection by the &s;acrifice of your honour. If he is capable of a &s;incere and generous pa&s;&s;ion, he will e&s;teem and re|verence that virtue which oppo&s;es his de&s;ires; and his e&s;teem will &s;trengthen his love.</Q></P>
<P>"Yes," cried mi&s;s Belmour,
<Q>he &s;hall find that he is not &s;o &s;ure of me as he has the pre|&s;umption to imagine. I will tell him &s;o my|&s;elf, and &s;ee him again, but it &s;hall be only to declare that I will never &s;ee him more&mdash;Give me pen and ink, my dear Henrietta: I will appoint him a meeting at lady D&mdash;'s this evening; and while the company is engaged at cards, I &s;hall have an opportunity to tell him the re&s;olution I have formed, and doubt no but I will &s;peak to him in the &s;evere&s;t term

my re&s;entment can &s;ugge&s;t: he &s;hall know, to his confu&s;ion, that I am in earne&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed, madam," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>that is not the way to per&s;uade him that you are in earne&s;t; let your actions &s;peak for you; &s;hun him carefully, and then he mu&s;t be convinced that you do not feign.</Q></P>
<P>"I have thought of a way to torment him," &s;aid mi&s;s Belmour, after a little pau&s;e;
<Q>I will go to Paris. La&s;t year &s;ome ladies of my acquaintance propo&s;ed to me to go there with them, and I had almo&s;t con&s;ented; but the wretch, who braves me &s;o in&s;olently now, declared then that he could not &s;upport my ab&s;ence, and &s;eemed &s;o overwhelmed with grief that I put off my journey for that time: but now were he to offer to &s;tab him&s;elf at my feet, it &s;hould not alter my purpo&s;e. I will write to him this moment, and let him know my de&s;ign.</Q></P>
<P>"Let me intreat you, madam," &s;aid Hen|rietta,
<Q>not to do that; go fir&s;t, and write to him afterwards&mdash;And yet I could recom|mend a better way of puni&s;hing this in&s;olent lover.</Q></P>
<P>"Tell me what better way," cried mi&s;s Bel|mour, eagerly.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="185">"It is to marry, madam," replied Hen|rietta;
<Q>chu&s;e out of that crowd of lovers who addre&s;s you, him whom you think mo&s;t de&s;erving. Marriage will &s;ecure your peace, your honour, and reputation, and effectually puni&s;h, the man who made the &s;acrifice of all the&s;e, the nece&s;&s;ary condition of his love for you.</Q></P>
<P>This expedient was not at all approved of by mi&s;s Belmour. She declared &s;he hated the whole &s;ex for Mr. Campley's &s;ake; and Hen|rietta had no difficulty to believe her: however, &s;he prevailed with her to promi&s;e that &s;he would keep her intended journey &s;ecret till &s;he was ju&s;t ready to depart, that it might not &s;eem as if &s;he meant only to alarm her de&s;igning lover. This promi&s;e &s;he ob&s;erved &s;o ill, that &s;he de|clared that very day at lady D&mdash;'s her inten|tion to &s;pend a few months in Paris. Mr. Campley, who was there, and who &s;till kept up his a&s;&s;umed indifference, in&s;tead of endeavour|ing to alter her purpo&s;e, as &s;he expected, coldly congratulated her on the plea&s;ures &s;he would enjoy in that enchanting metropolis. Mi&s;s Bel|mour came home ready to bur&s;t with rage and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>"I knew how it would be, madam," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>if you talked of your de&s;ign. Mr.
<PB N="179" REF="186">
Campley thinks he &s;ees through the artifice of it: all you can do now is to ha&s;ten your de|parture.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am re&s;olved I'll &s;et out to-morrow morn|ing,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Belmour.
<Q>No matter for preparations; pack up a few nece&s;&s;aries to take with us in the coach, and leave direc|tions for my trunks to be &s;ent after. When we come to Dover, if there is not a packet|boat ready to &s;ail, I'll hire one at any price: I &s;hall not be at re&s;t till I have convinced this man I am really determined to avoid him.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta kept up this &s;pirit; and after &s;he had given proper directions to the hou&s;ekeeper, and &s;ent orders for the coach to be ready early in the morning, &s;he bu&s;ied her&s;elf in packing up, her lady a&s;&s;i&s;ting, in a violent flutter of &s;pirits, and wi&s;hing impatiently for the hour of departure.</P>
<P>Our fair heroine had &s;ome objections to taking this journey her&s;elf, but her concern for mi&s;'s Belmour over-ruled them all. She was not willing to leave unfini&s;hed the good work &s;he had begun; and &s;he was apprehen&s;ive that, if the young lady was left to the guidance of her own pa&s;&s;ions, this &s;udden &s;ally of re&s;ent|ment
<PB N="180" REF="187">
would end in a reconciliation fatal to her virtue.</P>
<P>She would have been glad to &s;ee the counte&s;s before &s;he went, but there was no time for this vi&s;it; therefore &s;he contented her&s;elf with writing to that lady, and to her friend Mrs. Willis. The counte&s;s received the news of this journey with great plea&s;ure, becau&s;e &s;he hoped that ab&s;ence would effectually cure her &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion for Henrietta, the con&s;equences of which &s;he was &s;till apprehen&s;ive of, notwith&s;tand|ing he had &s;hewn an extraordinary prudence in the conduct of it.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Willis was very unea&s;y, le&s;t any thing &s;hould happen that might make her re|pent the removing her&s;elf thus from all her friends, and putting her&s;elf entirely in the power of a &s;tranger. Had there been time for it, &s;he would have endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade Henrietta from going; but, recollecting that Mr. Bale was in France, and that they might po&s;&s;ibly meet, &s;he re&s;olved to write to the old gentleman, and give him a full account of every thing relating to the &s;ituation of his fair per&s;ecuted ward, not even omitting his &s;on's doubtful behaviour with regard to her; for &s;he knew, that if they met, Henrietta would be
<PB N="181" REF="188">
&s;ilent upon that article, and yet it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould know it, that he might be convinced her misfortunes were chiefly owing to his &s;on's treachery; and this con&s;ideration &s;he hoped would produce &s;omething to her advantage.</P>

and would &s;igh when &s;he drew in her head again, as if &s;he had been di&s;appointed&mdash; Doubtle&s;s &s;he had conceived hopes that her lover would follow her; and, con&s;idering this neglect as a new proof of his indifference, it re|doubled her rage, and &s;trengthened a re&s;olu|tion which rea&s;on and virtue had very little &s;hare in.</P>
<P>This thought gave Henrietta great concern: her conver&s;ion promi&s;ed no great permanency, &s;ince it was founded on &s;uch motives; but all &s;he could now do was to manage her pa&s;&s;ions, for the time was not yet come, to touch her heart by &s;entiments of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>On their arrival at Dover, they found the Ca|lais packet-boat ready to &s;ail. Mi&s;s Belmour, who would fain have lingered at Dover a day, was not much plea&s;ed with this circum&s;tance, but her pride was concerned not to betray any irre|&s;olution; accordingly &s;he embarked with a to|lerable good grace; and the wind continuing fair, they &s;oon landed at Calais.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Belmour having made the journey be|fore, was under no embara&s;&s;ment how to con|duct her&s;elf. The cu&s;tomary ceremonies at landing being over, &s;he proceeded to the inn &s;he had formerly been at; and having hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e for her&s;elf and Henrietta, and a hor&s;e
<PB N="184" REF="191">

<P>As the chai&s;e &s;topped at the inn they put up at, two gentlemen alighted from their hor&s;es at the &s;ame time; one of whom hearing they were Engli&s;h ladies advanced, and re&s;pectfully offered them his hand to help them out. Mi&s;s Belmour, plea&s;ed with the graceful appearance of this &s;tranger, politely accepted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he likewi&s;e tendered to Henrietta, who&s;e charms, at the fir&s;t glance, made a powerful impre&s;&s;ion on his heart.</P>
<P>His eyes told her this &s;o intelligibly, that &s;he was under &s;ome confu&s;ion; yet &s;he found in her&s;elf a kind of &s;atisfaction at the attention with which he gazed on her, and was now for the fir&s;t time &s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ure of cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing but, accu&s;tomed to watch carefully over the motions of her own mind, &s;he checked this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing vanity; and a little a&s;hamed of the folly &s;he di&s;covered in her&s;elf, &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hand, which he &s;till held, as not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ma&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enough of him&s;elf to part with it, though &s;he was already out of the chai&s;e; and think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> him by a graceful courte&s;y for his civility. &s;he followed mi&s;s Belmour into the room the land lady had conducted her to.</P>

<P>"What! I'll warrant you," &s;aid the other,

<Q>you have a mind to exert the governor too; but let me tell you, that, con&s;idering the equality of our years and the terms we have hitheto lived upon, this wi&s;dom is very un&s;ea&s;onable.</Q></P>
<P>The young lord, having &s;aid this with &s;ome emotion, ha&s;tily entered the hou&s;e; and calling to the inn-keeper to &s;hew him a room, went away, without taking any farther notice of his governor, who &s;tood mu&s;ing for &s;ome time after he was gone, and then followed him with an intention to bring him, if po&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on.</P>

He rang the bell, without waiting for his friend's an&s;wer, and, one of his &s;ervants appearing, he ordered him to pre&s;ent Mr. Freeman's and his compliments to the two Engli&s;h ladies, with a reque&s;t that they would permit them to wait upon them.</P>

<P>Henrietta, &s;en&s;ible of an agitation which &s;he had never known before, would have cho&s;e not to have &s;hared this vi&s;it; but it was not po&s;|&s;ible to avoid it: mi&s;s Belmour had obliged her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> throw off the character of a &s;ervant, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve with her upon the footing of a friend and companion; to which Henrietta was in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uced to con&s;ent, by the hope &s;he had, that his familiarity would furni&s;h her with oppor|tunities to guard her unhappy mi&s;tre&s;s again&s;t the evils into which her blind pa&s;&s;ion was hurry|ing her.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="197">To this mark of con&s;ideration and e&s;teem mi&s;s Belmour added a mo&s;t affectionate beha|viour, which entirely won the heart of the tender and grateful Henrietta: for nothing &s;o much re|&s;embles true friend&s;hip, as tho&s;e connexions which lovers form with per&s;ons whom they make the confidants of their pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, Henrietta was obliged to receive the compliments of Mr. Melvil and his friend, as well as her lady, who, &s;oon after, fell into a fit of mu&s;ing, that made it nece&s;&s;ary for our fair heroine to keep up the conver&s;a|tion with the two gentlemen, which &s;he did with that &s;prightline&s;s and vivacity &s;o natural to her.</P>
<P>The graces of her wit, the ea&s;y elegance of her manners, and the mode&s;t dignity of her de|portment, formed new chains for the heart of Melvil.

<P><PB N="191" REF="198">Henrietta, who well remembered to have &s;een the&s;e travellers taking the very contrary route, was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at this declaration; but mi&s;s Belmour, ab&s;orbed in her own reflec|tions, was wholly ignorant of that circum|&s;tance; and, con&s;idering this offer in no other light than that of general politene&s;s, &s;he re|ceived it with her u&s;ual complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>The youth and beauty of the two ladies made their apparent independent &s;ituation a matter of curio&s;ity to Mr. Freeman, as well as the profound melancholy in which one of them &s;eemed buried.</P>
<P>Melvil was little concerned in the&s;e enqui|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies; all his thoughts were taken up with the perfections he found in her who had charmed him; and he was much le&s;s &s;olicitous to di&s;cover who &s;he was, than how to make him&s;elf agreeable to her.

This change exactly com|menced at the time Mr. Melvil went away but &s;he did not perceive it her&s;elf, and &s;tarted as from a dream, when mi&s;s Belmour reproach her with it.</P>
<P>Concerned that &s;he had given room for &s;u&s;picion of this nature, &s;he began, as &s;oon
<PB N="193" REF="200">
&s;he was alone, to examine her own heart: mi&s;s Belmour had prai&s;ed the per&s;onal graces of Mr. Melvil, and it was but ju&s;tice to own, that he was eminently hand&s;ome; but was &s;he weak enough to be dazzled with the beauty of a man? No, certainly; his countenance plea&s;ed her, becau&s;e it was a picture of his mind; candor, &s;weetne&s;s, benevolence, &s;hined in every feature: the politene&s;s of his addre&s;s, his gentle manners, that air &s;o noble, yet &s;o peculiarly &s;oft and engaging, his good &s;en&s;e, and, above all, the ju&s;tne&s;s and purity of his &s;entiments, which &s;he had time enough to di&s;|cover during their conver&s;ation; were not the&s;e qualities which a mode&s;t young woman might e&s;teem? and is love a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of e&s;teeming one of that &s;ex? Mu&s;t &s;he deny her&s;elf the plea&s;ure of approving virtue and merit, for fear of loving it too much? It was thus &s;he argued, and &s;oon di&s;pelled tho&s;e doubts which mi&s;s Belmour's raillery had rai&s;ed in her mind.</P>
<P>While Henrietta, under the notion of barely e&s;teeming what was indeed truly worthy of e&s;teem, was in&s;en&s;ibly giving way to more tender &s;entments, Mr. Melvil, who loved with all the tenderne&s;s and ardor of a fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, as his really was, burned with impatience
<PB N="194" REF="201">
for the hour when they were to join the fair travellers: Freeman directed his attention to mi&s;s Belmour, which gave the young lover an opportunity of employing his whole care and a&s;&s;iduity about his mi&s;tre&s;s, who a&s;cribed all to his natural politene&s;s, and remained in a per|fect tranquility, as well with regard to his &s;en|timents as her own. Mi&s;s Belmour's experi|ence, however, &s;oon let her into the &s;ecret of their hearts. Melvil's pa&s;&s;ion was indeed ap|parent enough, notwith&s;tanding the pains he was at to conceal it, thro' fear of his friend's trouble&s;ome remon&s;trances; but Henrietta's, tho' hid from her&s;elf, was open to mi&s;s Bel|mour's di&s;cerning eyes, and &s;he exulted in the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>This rigid cen&s;urer of her conduct; this in|flexibly virtuous maid, was entangled in the &s;nares of love. She perceived that &s;he her&s;elf was ignorant of her own danger, and &s;he was re&s;olved not to draw her out of this fal&s;e &s;ecu|rity by any un&s;ea&s;onable railleries: for, how|ever u&s;eful the &s;trict principles of Henrietta had been to her, yet &s;he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;upe|riority they gave her; and &s;he rejo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d in the hope, that a pa&s;&s;ion, perhaps as unfortunate placed as her own, would reduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to a equality with her.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="202">Their journey now drew near a period: Melvil trembled at the thoughts of parting; he had indeed laid the foundation of an intimacy with the two ladies, which would give him a right to vi&s;it them in Paris; but he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee the object of his pa&s;&s;ion continually, from the fir&s;t moment of his acquaintance with her: and altho' they never &s;eparated till the evening, yet he thought the time amazingly long till they met again. How then would he be able to &s;upport an ab&s;ence of two or three days, which decorum would oblige him to make the interval of his vi&s;its? be&s;ides, &s;he was &s;till ignorant of the &s;entiments &s;he had in|&s;pired him with. Hitherto he had never found an opportunity of &s;peaking to her alone; but if one &s;hould offer, how could he declare him&s;elf to a woman, for whom he felt as much re&s;pect as love? yet one, who&s;e birth he was igno|rant of, who &s;eemed to be in a dependent &s;itua|tion, whom he could not think of marrying, and whom he dur&s;t not wi&s;h to &s;educe.</P>
<P>The difficulties he could not remove he endeavoured to bani&s;h from his thoughts; and, without con&s;idering what mu&s;t be the event of the pa&s;&s;ion he was thus indulging, he for the pre&s;ent confined all his wi&s;hes to the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="203">Mi&s;s Belmour had often wondered that this young lover &s;hewed &s;o little &s;olicitude to make opportunities of &s;peaking to his mi&s;tre&s;s in pri|vate. She could not impute this behaviour to want of ardor; every look he gave her was expre&s;&s;ive of the tenderne&s;s his &s;oul was filled with: it was then re&s;pect, it was awe, it was fear of offending, that laid him under this re|&s;traint. How glorious this for Henrietta how humiliating for her, who had &s;carce e&s;caped falling a &s;acrifice to the di&s;honourable attempts of her lover! Was &s;he then le&s;s capable of in|&s;piring a re&s;pectful pa&s;&s;ion than her woman? or did her charms act more powerfully on the heart &s;he had &s;ubdued, than tho&s;e of Henrietta? This que&s;tion her &s;elf-love ea&s;ily decided; and, from the &s;ame &s;entiment, &s;he was per&s;uaded that Henrietta, with all her boa&s;ted virtue, would defend her&s;elf as weakly again&s;t the lover her inclinations declared for, as the had done. Her pre&s;ent triumph, &s;he thought, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> owe|ing to her own &s;trength than her lover's weak|ne&s;s, who had not yet made a formal attack upon her heart: curio&s;ity to know what effect the declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion would have, made her re&s;olve to give him an opportunity of &s;peak|ing to her in private. They were now within a day's journey of Paris. On their arrival at
<PB N="197" REF="204">
the hou&s;e where they were to dine, Mr. Free|man, as u&s;ual, went to give orders for their en|tertainment, and left Melvil with the two la|dies. Mi&s;s Belmour, pretending that &s;he had a mind for &s;ome particular di&s;h, ran after him, and kept him in conver&s;ation, that he might not interrupt the lovers, who being now for the fir&s;t time alone together, were both equally embar|ra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Henrietta ca&s;t down her eyes, &s;urpri&s;ed at the confu&s;ion in which &s;he found her&s;elf, and &s;hocked at the intelligence this new emotion gave her of the true &s;tate of her heart. Mr. Melvil approached her trembling; he could not re&s;olve to lo&s;e &s;o favourable an opportunity of declaring his &s;entiments to her: but the natural goodne&s;s and rectitude of his mind &s;ugge&s;ting to him, that it was a kind of fraud to &s;eek en|couragement of a pa&s;&s;ion, the de&s;ign of which he was not him&s;elf able to an&s;wer for, he re|mained a few moments in &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>This &s;ilence increa&s;ed Henrietta's embarra&s;&s;|ment, but &s;uddenly reflecting upon the advan|tage it gave Mr. Melvil over her, &s;he turned her eyes towards him, with a look, in which &s;he endeavoured to throw as much indifference as po&s;&s;ible, but which, neverthele&s;s, had an unu&s;ual coldne&s;s in it; &s;o that Melvil, partly
<PB N="198" REF="205">
with-held by his extreme delicacy, and partly by the awe which this &s;evere glance in&s;pired him with, dropped, for that time, all thoughts of declaring his pa&s;&s;ion, and immediately entered into an indifferent conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Henrietta &s;eemed as if relieved from a pain|ful load; her countenance re&s;umed its former &s;weetne&s;s, and &s;he talked to him with her u&s;ual vivacity; yet mi&s;s Belmour, at her return, &s;aw &s;ome remains of her late unea&s;ine&s;s in her eyes: &s;he ob&s;erved too, that &s;he &s;poke le&s;s to Mr. Melvil, and more to his friend than &s;he did be|fore; that &s;he &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided the looks of the former; and that her behaviour to him was le&s;s free and obliging than it u&s;ed to be. All this &s;he looked upon as the play of coquetry; and in Mr. Melvil's apparent melancholy &s;he &s;aw its purpo&s;e and effect.</P>
<P>But Henrietta taught by what pa&s;&s;ed in her own heart, during the few moments &s;he was alone with Mr. Melvil, that &s;he not only con|&s;idered him as a lover, but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> by his engaging qualities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to &s;trengthen her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, by continuing to &s;ee and conver&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Lord B&mdash;'s behaviour had given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of men. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> at her own imprudence, in &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the

humble &s;tation that Providence had placed her in, as to entertain &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s for a man, who, from the inequality there was be|tween them, might think him&s;elf authori&s;ed to form expectations injurious to her honour: tho' her weakne&s;s was &s;o lately known to her&s;elf, yet &s;he fancied it had been perceived by others before, and that even Mr. Melvil had di&s;covered the preference with which &s;he regarded him. It was this thought which made her &s;o &s;uddenly alter her behaviour; but as indifference is, of all di&s;po&s;itions of the mind, the harde&s;t to feign, Melvil imputed the apparent con&s;traint in her manner to &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t he had unhap|pily given her, and mi&s;s Belmour to the artifice of a coquet.</P>
<P>Henrietta, who was far from imagining &s;he over-acted her part, continued, during the whole time they were at dinner, to avoid her lover's looks, &s;o carefully that he had no oppor|tunity to make her comprehend by them, how much he was concerned at her extraordinary coldne&s;s. However, &s;he could not, without affectation, refu&s;e him her hand when they left the inn; but they followed Mr. Freeman and mi&s;s Belmour &s;o clo&s;e, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to &s;peak to her without being over|heard; and he in vain &s;ought her eyes: they

were always directed another way. He &s;ighed when he helped her into the chai&s;e; and if &s;he had not turned her face from him that moment, the blu&s;h with which it was over&s;pread, would have &s;hewn him that &s;he took but too much no|tice of that &s;igh.</P>
<P>"You are melancholy, Henrietta," &s;aid mi&s;s Belmour, after looking at her in &s;ilence for a long time, attentive to the motions of her mind, which might be ea&s;ily read in her counte|nance.</P>
<P>"Am I, madam?" replied &s;he, with a &s;igh half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and a gentle &s;mile.</P>
<P>"Yes, indeed, are you," re&s;umed mi&s;s Bel|mour, mimicking the languid accent in which &s;he &s;poke;
<Q>and I don't remember that I ever &s;aw you &s;o before.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And yet I have many cau&s;es for melan|choly, madam,</Q>
replied Henrietta, who&s;e heart was full, and &s;he eagerly gra&s;ped at this opportunity to relieve her&s;elf by tears; tears, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he gave to the remembrance of her misfortunes, without a&s;king her&s;elf, why that remembrance was more poignant now than before.</P>
<P>"Ah! Henrietta," &s;aid mi&s;s Belmour, &s;haking her head,

She &s;topped abruptly, and ca&s;t down her eyes: the mention of that name &s;eemed to lead her to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;he had be|trayed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Belmour was affected with her beauti|ful &s;implicity.
<Q>Don't be a&s;hamed, my dear Henrietta,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, taking her hand,

<P>"No, madam, no," interrupted Henrietta, with great earne&s;tne&s;s,
<Q>I would not &s;eek in|dulgence for my weakne&s;&s;es: but I conjure you, madam,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, with tears that in &s;pite of her endeavours would force their way,

<P><PB N="202" REF="209">Notwith&s;tanding the delicate turn which Hen|rietta gave to a declaration, which &s;hewed &s;he was determined early to conquer her pa&s;&s;ion, yet mi&s;s Belmour con&s;idered it as a triumph over her, who had not been capable of acting with equal prudence.</P>
<P><Q>It is happy for you (&s;aid &s;he, coldly) that you need no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to help you to keep your pa&s;&s;ions in &s;ubjection; but I owe you too many obligations for the good coun&s;el you have given me, to permit you to appear in any other character than that of my friend.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta's mind was in &s;o much agitation, that &s;he did not take in the full &s;en&s;e of this an|&s;wer, but &s;truck with the obliging purport of the la&s;t words of it, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude in terms full of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of Paris drew them both out of a long &s;ilence, which had &s;ucceeded a conver&s;a|tion with which neither had been plea&s;ed: Hen|rietta, becau&s;e it had di&s;covered &s;o much weak|ne&s;s on her &s;ide; mi&s;s Belmour, becau&s;e it had &s;hewn &s;o little.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s Belmour, at parting, told them, &s;he hoped to &s;ee them again in a day or two, when &s;he &s;hould be &s;ettled.

<P>Mi&s;s Belmour blamed her for this conduct.

<P>Mi&s;s Belmour, who knew how difficult it was to be in love and be wi&s;e, laughed at a re|&s;olution, which &s;he did not think it would be always in her power to maintain. Poor Hen|rietta, who had &s;o artle&s;sly laid open her heart, was often expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t poignant raillery from her; but at length &s;he was delivered from this kind of per&s;ecution by a &s;urpri&s;ing alteration in mi&s;s Belmour her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This young lady, who had fled from her lover, rather with a hope of &s;timulating his pa&s;|&s;ion than of &s;ubduing her own, though &s;he en|deavoured to impo&s;e upon her&s;elf in believing the latter to be the true motive of her conduct, fell into a mo&s;t violent de&s;pair, when &s;he found
<PB N="205" REF="212">
that, far from following her, he did not even &s;eek a reconciliation by writing to her. Sick of her&s;elf, the world, and tired of her exi&s;t|ence, &s;he mi&s;took the agitations of a heart tortured by jealou&s;y, di&s;appointment, and the pangs of &s;lighted love, for the motions of grace and the genuine marks of repentance. She neglected her dre&s;s, took no plea&s;ure in any amu&s;ement, avoided company, and &s;pent whole hours in her clo&s;et, where &s;he wept and prayed by turns.</P>
<P>She told Henrietta, that the world and all its plea&s;ures were grown in&s;ipid to her; that her whole &s;oul was filled with divine love; and that the thoughts and exerci&s;es of religion made up all her happine&s;s. She then pa&s;&s;ionately re|gretted that there were no religious communi|ties among the prote&s;tants, where a mind that was weaned from this &s;ublunary world, and all its vanities, might freely indulge its pious con|templations, and devote it&s;elf entirely to Hea|ven. "Oh, how happy are the nuns!" &s;he exclaimed;
<Q>how I envy them! Sure nothing can be more delightful, when per&s;ons are truly pious, than to live in a religious &s;ociety excluded from all commerce with a world they mu&s;t certainly de&s;pi&s;e. I think I &s;hould be perfectly happy if I was in a cloi&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213">Henrietta congratulated her upon her new &s;entiments, but endeavoured to prove that there was more merit in pa&s;&s;ing through life with in|nocence, and in rightly performing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, than in flying to the gloomy &s;olitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i|&s;ter, where virtue is &s;ecured by bolts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs, and the exerci&s;es of religion performed as a penance. She recommended to her the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, and put &s;ome practical trea|ti&s;es of religion, written by the be&s;t authors on that &s;ubject, into her hands: but the zeal of this new convert was &s;o flaming, that nothing would &s;erve her but a total retirement from the world; and &s;he made &s;uch frequent vi&s;its to a convent, where a friend of her's had lately taken the veil, that Henrietta was apprehen&s;ive the nuns would di&s;cover the true &s;tate of her mind and take advantage of her pa&s;&s;ions to pervert he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> principles, and &s;ecure her to them&s;elves.</P>

<P>"May I peri&s;h," replied Melvil, with &s;ome emotion,
<Q>if I would degrade &s;uch excellence to a mi&s;tre&s;s; but if I were capable of &s;uch a de&s;ign, her virtue, I am &s;ure, is incorruptible.

<P>THEY found the two ladies together: Henrietta could not, without affectation, avoid her lover that day, as &s;he was in the room when he came in; and he, who had not been &s;o fortunate for &s;everal days before, found &s;o much delight in looking at her and hearing her &s;peak, that he forgot he came to pay a farewel vi&s;it, which Mr. Freeman ob&s;erving, took care to mention their de&s;ign of leaving Paris the next day.</P>

<Q>and this indifference with re|gard to him is a very bad omen.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope Mr. Melvil is well," &s;aid Henrietta gravely, without &s;eeming to take any notice o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;trange &s;peech he had made.</P>
<P><Q>He is better than he was three or four day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ago,</Q>
replied Freeman,
<Q>when his phy&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+cians de&s;paired of his life.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="226">"Ble&s;s me!" cried Henrietta, with an emo|tion &s;he could not &s;uppre&s;s,
<Q>has Mr. Melvil been &s;o ill then? I am extremely concerned to hear it.</Q></P>
<P>"You would, no doubt," &s;aid Freeman,
<Q>be more concerned if you knew you were the cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"This kind of raillery, Mr. Freeman," re|plied Henrietta, a little confu&s;ed,
<Q>is not at all agreeable to me, I a&s;&s;ure you.</Q></P>
<P>"By Heaven I am &s;erious," re&s;umed Free|man;
<Q>my friend loves you with the utmo&s;t ardor: I am a witne&s;s to the birth and pro|gre&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion, and to his fruitle&s;s endea|vours to conquer it. The effort he made to leave Paris, has almo&s;t co&s;t him his life; he was taken ill the evening before our intended departure. Oh, mi&s;s Ben&s;on! had you heard with what tenderne&s;s he called upon your name, when the violence of his fever had de|prived him of his &s;en&s;es, I am &s;ure you mu&s;t have pitied him.</Q></P>
<P>Freeman perceived by the changes in Hen|rietta's countenance, that &s;he did not hear him without emotion. He pau&s;ed, in expectation of &s;ome pretty affected an&s;wer, that would give hope while it &s;eemed to de&s;troy it; but Hen|rietta,
<PB N="220" REF="227">
with a compo&s;ed look and accent, re|plied,</P>
<P><Q>If I am to believe this account of your friend's illne&s;s not exaggerated, permit me to ask you, &s;ir, what is your de&s;ign by making me acquainted with his &s;entiments, and what you expect from me upon this occa&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P>Freeman was a little di&s;concerted by this &s;peech, and at the manner in which &s;he delivered it; but, relying on the intelligence he had re|ceived from mi&s;s Belmour,</P>
<P><Q>I expect you will have compa&s;&s;ion on my friend (&s;aid he) and give him an opportunity to declare to you him&s;elf the pa&s;&s;ion you have in&s;pired him with.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will be very free with you, Mr. Free|man,</Q>
replied Henrietta;
<Q>your ready con|currence with your friend in the liking you &s;ay he has entertained for me, is not con&s;i&s;tent with your good &s;en&s;e and prudence. Mr. Melvil is a young man of rank and fortune; I am poor and dependent; my birth perhaps greatly inferior to his. Will his parents, think you, approve of &s;uch a choice?</Q></P>
<P><Q>What has parents to do with a tender en|gagement?</Q>
interrupted Freeman;
<Q>an en+gagement in which the heart only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con+&s;ulted.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="228">
<Q>Were my heart ever &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed in fa|vour of your friend,</Q>
re&s;umed Henrietta, not willing to under&s;tand him,
<Q>I would not re|ceive his addre&s;&s;es without the &s;anction of his parents' con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>Freeman could hardly help &s;miling at this formal declaration; and, &s;uppo&s;ing that the be&s;t way to drive the&s;e &s;trange notions out of her head, was to acquaint her with Melvil's quality, which he likewi&s;e expected would have no &s;mall influence over her,</P>
<P><Q>It is not fit (&s;aid he) that you &s;hould be any longer ignorant of the rank of him whom your charms have &s;ubjected. Melvil is not the name of my friend; he is the heir of an illu&s;trious title and a great e&s;tate: he loves you, he will make your fortune; do not throw away this opportunity of freeing your&s;elf from poverty and dependance, nor let a romantic notion of virtue deprive you of the advantages that are offered you.</Q></P>
<P>"Hold, &s;ir," interrupted Henrietta, ri&s;ing from her chair,
<Q>this in&s;ult is too plain; I ought not to have li&s;tened to you &s;o long.</Q>
She &s;poke this with tolerable compo&s;ure; but, finding her tears begin to flow, &s;he turned a&s;ide to conceal them, and ha&s;tily wiping her eyes,

&s;he looked on him again with a kind of calm di&s;dain.</P>
<P><Q>I know not (&s;aid &s;he) what weakne&s;s you have di&s;covered in my behaviour to encourage you to make me &s;uch &s;hocking propo&s;al; but I may venture to tell you, though I am not the mi&s;tre&s;s of this apartment, that the doors of it &s;hall never be open to you again.</Q></P>
<P>She was hurrying out of the room when &s;he had &s;poke this, leaving Freeman in &s;o much confu&s;ion, that he knew not what to &s;ay to her, when mi&s;s Belmour entered with a letter in her hand.</P>
<P><Q>Do you know a gentleman of the name of Bale (&s;aid &s;he to Henrietta) who is at pre&s;ent at Montpelier?</Q></P>
<P>"I do, madam," replied &s;he, looking eagerly at the letter.</P>

<P>Henrietta retired immediately; and mi&s;s Bel|mour approached Mr. Freeman, who &s;tood leaning over his chair, with his eyes fixed on the ground,</P>
<P><Q>What is the matter with you? (&s;aid &s;he) you look exce&s;&s;ively pale.</Q></P>
<P>"Where is mi&s;s Ben&s;on, madam?" &s;aid he, &s;tarting out of his revery at the &s;ound of her voice.</P>
<P>"She is in her own chamber, I believe," re|plied mi&s;s Belmour;
<Q>but did you take notice of what pa&s;&s;ed about the letter, I delivered it to her before you on purpo&s;e: you &s;ee &s;he in a manner owned that Courteney is her true name; is not this &s;trange?</Q></P>
<P>"I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;peak to her again," &s;aid he, interrupting her, and making towards the door, "which way, pray madam?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Belmour followed him, &s;urpri&s;ed at the agitation he appeared to be in; and, pointing to a room ju&s;t oppo&s;ite, "you will find her there," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Freeman opened the door without any cere|mony; Henrietta, who was reading her letter,

looked up at the noi&s;e he made in entering:
<Q>this is extremely rude, &s;ir (&s;aid &s;he) I de&s;ire you will in&s;tantly be gone, and trouble me no more.</Q>
But, apprehen&s;ive that he would not quit her &s;o ea&s;ily, &s;he ru&s;hed by him, and was running to the room in which &s;he had left mi&s;s Belmour: he took hold of her hand, to prevent her leaving him; and &s;he was upon the point of expre&s;&s;ing her re&s;entment at the in&s;o|lence of this treatment, in har&s;her terms than any &s;he had yet u&s;ed, when &s;he &s;aw tears gu&s;h in great abundance from his eyes.

<P>"O my &s;i&s;ter!" cried he at la&s;t, bur&s;ting into a fre&s;h flood of tears;
<Q>my dear, dear &s;i&s;ter</Q>&mdash;He was not able to utter a word more, but led her gently back to her chamber, which &s;he permitted, trembling, confu&s;ed, and full of anxious expectation.</P>
<P>"How &s;trangely you look upon me!" &s;aid he,
<Q>do you doubt whether I am your bro|ther?</Q></P>
<P>"I know not what to think," replied &s;he, &s;hrinking from his embrace; for he had folded his arms about her.</P>

pur&s;ued he, after a little pau&s;e; and, taking a miniature picture out of his pocket,
<Q>You will certainly be able to re|collect your mother's picture (&s;aid he) which &s;he gave me at parting.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta looked at the picture, ki&s;&s;ed it, and then threw her&s;elf in tears upon her brother's neck&mdash;

pur&s;ued &s;he, ki&s;&s;ing again the picture of her mother, which &s;he &s;till held; then &s;uddenly cla&s;ping her hands together, and lifting up her fine eyes, which were &s;wimming in tears,

<Q>Indeed, my dear &s;i&s;ter, I never &s;hall forgive my&s;elf for having ignorantly practi&s;ed on your virtue.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! that my brother," replied Henrietta,
<Q>would be taught by this accident never more to form de&s;igns again&s;t innocence; and, in ca&s;es like mine, to con&s;ider every virtuous young woman as a &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Courteney, for &s;o we &s;hall now call him, was extremely moved at the&s;e words. He gazed at her &s;ome moments with mingled tenderne&s;s and delight; but all on a &s;udden, as if &s;truck with &s;ome painful reflection,</P>

<P><PB N="227" REF="234">"You don't an&s;wer my que&s;tion," replied he, peevi&s;hly.</P>

<P>Mr. Courteney &s;ighed deeply at this account, and remained for &s;everal moments &s;ilent; at length recovering him&s;elf,</P>
<P><Q>Mi&s;s Belmour, it &s;eems (&s;aid he) did not always know your real name&mdash;You appear to be on the footing of a companion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mi&s;s Belmour was plea&s;ed to take a liking to me,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta;
<Q>and, though ig|norant of my birth, would not &s;uffer me to continue with her in the character of a &s;ervant &mdash;I have been greatly obliged to her.</Q></P>
<P>"Yes, you are obliged to her," interrupted Mr. Courteney, kindling into rage at the re|membrance

<P><Q>I will not &s;uffer you to remain any longer with her,</Q>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The hi&s;tory continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR fair heroine continued &s;ome time alone in her chamber, &s;o tran&s;ported at this un|expected meeting with her brother, that &s;he &s;ometimes doubted whether her happine&s;s was real, and whether all that had part was not an illu&s;ion of her fancy. When her &s;pirits were a little compo&s;ed, &s;he began to con&s;ider what rea|&s;on &s;he &s;hould give mi&s;s Belmour for quitting her &s;o &s;uddenly: &s;he rightly judged that the &s;e|crecy her brother had recommended to her, pro|ceeded
<PB N="230" REF="237">
from his embarra&s;&s;ment with regard to Mr. Melvil; and &s;he re&s;olved, however &s;trange her going away might appear to mi&s;s Belmour, to follow his directions punctually.</P>
<P>The treachery this young lady had been guilty of towards her, excited le&s;s re&s;entment than grief for the conviction it brought her, that her principles were not changed. Several circum|&s;tances now ru&s;hed upon her memory, which &s;erved to convince her &s;he was relap&s;ing into her former indi&s;cretions; and &s;he doubted not but mi&s;s Belmour would be rejoiced to be delivered from her pre&s;ence. This thought gave her cou|rage to go to her immediately, and acquaint her with her intention.</P>
<P><Q>A &s;trange alteration has happened in my af|fairs, madam,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, entering her apart|ment, "within this hour."</P>
<P><Q>That letter has brought you &s;ome good news, I &s;uppo&s;e,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Belmour, coldly.</P>
<P><Q>It came from a dear and worthy friend madam,</Q>
replied Henrietta;
<Q>and I have in|deed heard &s;ome good news, which I little expected: but I am obliged to leave you and &s;o &s;uddenly, that I am afraid you will thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me ungrateful for your kindne&s;s, in &s;ubmitting to this nece&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238">"Pray make no apologies," interrupted mi&s;s Belmour, with great indifference,
<Q>you are en|tirely at your own liberty.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, who thought &s;he had rea&s;on for this behaviour, was &s;tudying for &s;ome an&s;wer, which, without revealing the &s;ecret motive of her conduct, might tend in &s;ome mea&s;ure to excu&s;e it; when a &s;ervant introduced a gentle|man into the room, who, though &s;he had &s;een but once, &s;he knew immediately to be Mr. Campley. She turned eagerly to ob&s;erve how mi&s;s Belmour was affected by this vi&s;it; and di&s;|covering no &s;igns of &s;urpri&s;e or anger in her countenance, but an exce&s;s of joy and &s;atisfac|tion, &s;he concluded this meeting was concerted, and retired immediately, in great concern, to her own room.</P>
<P>Here, while &s;he waited her brother's return, &s;he employed her&s;elf in writing to mi&s;s Belmour. In this letter &s;he repeated what &s;he had often urged before, to guard her again&s;t the ba&s;e de|&s;igns of her lover: &s;he recalled to her remem|brance the re&s;olution &s;he had made, and the vows with which &s;he had &s;ealed it, never more to li&s;ten to his de&s;tructive addre&s;&s;es; and conjured her, by every motive of religion, honour, and virtue, to bani&s;h from her &s;ight a man who&s;e only aim was to ruin her.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239">She had &s;carce fini&s;hed her letter, when a &s;ervant came to tell her, that &s;ome company waited for her in a coach. She made ha&s;te to &s;eal it, and gave it to mi&s;s Belmour's maid, with orders to deliver it to her lady. At the door &s;he found her brother, who helped her into the coach, and came in after her. He a&s;ked her, &s;miling, how &s;he had parted with mi&s;s Bel|mour?</P>
<P>Henrietta told him, &s;he had left her with company.
<Q>It is indifferent to me what company &s;he &s;ees now you are not with her,</Q>
&s;aid he:
<Q>but my heart will not be at re&s;t till I hear all your &s;tory, &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>

I have endeavoured to acquit my&s;elf faithfully of this tru&s;t; my pupil and I have always lived together like brothers; and I flatter my&s;elf his father will have no cau&s;e to repent his having con&s;igned him to my care.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But why did you take the names of Melvil and Freeman?</Q>
interrupted Henrietta.</P>
<P>"The marquis," replied Mr. Courteney,
<Q>had an inclination to travel without the pa|rade of quality, that he might, as he wrote to his father, make nearer and more u&s;eful ob&s;ervations upon men and manners; and, being indulged in this &s;cheme, we have tra|velled thro' France and Italy under tho&s;e

I will do him the ju&s;tice to own that he never formed any di&s;honoura|ble de&s;igns upon you. The character of the woman you lived with, encouraged me to make you &s;ome &s;hocking propo&s;als. You be|haved very properly; but, my dear &s;i&s;ter, no words can expre&s;s my angui&s;h and confu&s;ion, when I heard you own the name of Courte|ney, and your connexions with Mr. Bale&mdash; Good Heaven! what did I not &s;uffer at that moment&mdash; What a wretch did I &s;eem in my own eyes!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let not this cruel remembrance di&s;turb you now, my dear brother,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta;
<Q>I am &s;o happy in finding you, that I forget all my pa&s;t unea&s;ine&s;&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>Her looks bore delightful witne&s;s to the truth of what &s;he &s;aid.

circum&s;tance that greatly increa&s;ed her &s;atisfac|tion in this meeting.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney looked at her with admiration and delight, while a tender &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;|fortunes &s;he had been expo&s;ed to, almo&s;t melted him into tears. As &s;oon as the coach &s;topped, he told her, that the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e they were going into was a very worthy man, with whom he was intimately acquainted, and who&s;e prudence he could depend upon.
<Q>His wife (pur&s;ued he) is a virtuous, &s;en&s;ible wo|man: I know no family &s;o proper to place you in as this; and it was extremely lucky that I thought of them upon this occa&s;ion, for it was not fit you &s;hould &s;tay with mi&s;s Belmour, and in &s;o &s;hort a time it was diffi|cult to di&s;po&s;e of you properly.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as they alighted, Mrs. Knight came to receive Henrietta, and pre&s;ented her husband to her. Both &s;eemed greatly charmed with her appearance, and politely thanked Mr. Cour|teney for bringing them &s;o agreeable a gue&s;t.</P>
<P>After a few compliments they withdrew, &s;uppo&s;ing the brother and &s;i&s;ter would be glad of an opportunity to conver&s;e together in pri|vate. Mr. Courteney immediately drew his chair near his &s;i&s;ter's, and, with a look of impatience, demanded the account &s;he had promi&s;ed him.</P>

She then gave him a candid relation of all that had happened to her, from her mother's death till the time &s;he met him at the inn, concealing nothing from him but mi&s;s Belmour's pa&s;&s;ion for Mr. Campley.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney was variou&s;ly affected during the cour&s;e of her little &s;tory. He often changed countenance, but would not interrupt her. He ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure, that &s;he laid no &s;tre&s;s upon any part of her conduct, which might with ju&s;tice challenge e&s;teem and admiration, but appeared nicely con&s;cious of every little im|prudence; and, when &s;he had ended, waited for his reply, with an anxiety that &s;hewed &s;he rather expected cen&s;ure than prai&s;e.</P>
<P>"My dear Henrietta," &s;aid Mr. Courteney, at length, with tears in his eyes,
<Q>you have acted nobly; you cannot imagine how much your &s;ufferings endear you to me, &s;ince you have behaved under them with &s;uch becom+ing fortitude.</Q></P>
<P>"How happy you make me," cried Hen+rietta,

<P><PB N="237" REF="244">"It was a ra&s;h &s;tep," replied Mr. Courteney,
<Q>but your &s;ub&s;equent conduct has effaced it; and I &s;ee not how you could have otherwi&s;e avoided being in the power of that viliain-prie&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome farther conver&s;ation on different parts of her &s;tory, he looked at his watch: "how fa&s;t the minutes fly!" &s;aid he, &s;miling.
<Q>My dear Henrietta, I mu&s;t leave you now, yet I have a thou&s;and things to &s;ay to you; but I will &s;ee you to-morrow morning. You will be very happy (continued he) with Mrs. Knight, and I &s;hall have no &s;cruple to tru&s;t you to her care, till I have conducted the marquis to London: we &s;hall go in a day or two; and, after I have delivered my charge &s;afe to his father, I will come back to Paris, and fetch you.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta turned pale at the&s;e words:
<Q>then we are to part again &s;oon!</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, in a melancholy accent.</P>
<P><Q>It would be highly improper for you (re|plied he) to take this journey with us, on &s;e|veral accounts: I &s;hall be concerned to leave you, but it mu&s;t be &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>"Could you not &s;tay till Mr. Bale comes?" interrupted Henrietta; and, taking his letter out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f her pocket,
<Q>&s;ee here how affectionately he
<PB N="238" REF="245">
writes to me (added &s;he) he propo&s;es to be in Paris in three weeks, and in&s;i&s;ts upon my going to England with him.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Courteney read the letter with great plea|&s;ure. Mr. Bale addre&s;&s;ed her in it by the tender name of daughter; and a&s;&s;ured her, that he would in every re&s;pect act like a father towards her. He prai&s;ed her conduct in terms of the highe&s;t admiration, and begged her not to be unea&s;y at her aunt's de&s;ertion of her; &s;ince it was in his power to make her ea&s;y, and he was re&s;olved to do &s;o.</P>
<P>"This letter," &s;aid Mr. Courteney, after a pau&s;e,
<Q>will make &s;ome little alteration in my plan: I had re&s;olved not to take any notice to the marquis, that I had di&s;covered you to be my &s;i&s;ter, but to make &s;ome excu&s;e for your di&s;appearing; however I &s;ee it will be nece&s;&s;ary to wait for Mr. Bale.

<P><Q>Sure (&s;aid he, &s;miling) you have met with &s;ome &s;trange adventure, Freeman; you look plea&s;ed, and yet there is a thoughtful air in your countenance.</Q></P>

<P>"That is not &s;urpri&s;ing," &s;aid the marquis
<Q>&s;he was very young when you parted, I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> heard you &s;ay: I hope you will allow me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pay my re&s;pects to her; but (added he, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> patiently) how does mi&s;s Belmour and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fair friend?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="248">
<Q>Her fair friend, as you are plea&s;ed to call her (replied Mr. Courteney) is my &s;i&s;ter, whom for &s;o many weeks I have &s;een almo&s;t every day without knowing her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Is it po&s;&s;ible! (cried the marquis, &s;urpri&s;ed) mi&s;s Ben&s;on your &s;i&s;ter! Sure you are not in earne&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed I am (&s;aid Mr. Courteney) I di&s;|covered her by the odde&s;t accident: mi&s;s Bel|mour her&s;elf did not know who &s;he was; but while I was there, &s;he brought her a letter, which had been inclo&s;ed to her; it was di|rected for mi&s;s Courteney, and came from Mr. Bale, my &s;i&s;ter's guardian: &s;he owned the name, and by that means I found out my &s;i&s;ter.

<P>"How can you think &s;o?" interrupted the marquis, eagerly:
<Q>can you doubt that I am extremely intere&s;ted in every thing that con|cerns you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Excu&s;e me, my dear marquis (&s;aid Mr. Courteney) I really cannot enter into parti|culars ju&s;t now&mdash; Fortune &s;till per&s;ecutes my dear father in his children. I thought my &s;i&s;ter was happily &s;ettled with her aunt lady
<PB N="242" REF="249">
Meadows, who has no child, and adopted her; but the old lady, being a rigid Roman catholic, pre&s;&s;ed her very much to change her religion, and was at la&s;t &s;o &s;trangely in|fluenced by an artful prie&s;t, who is her chap|lain, that &s;he had formed a de&s;ign to &s;end my &s;i&s;ter under the conduct of this fellow, to be &s;hut up in a nunnery. The poor girl, who was, as I can collect by her account ex|tremely apprehen&s;ive of being &s;o entirely in the power of this &s;ly prie&s;t, had no way to avoid this misfortune, but by leaving her aunt privately, who ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to be recon|ciled to her on any other condition than her changing her religion. Thus de&s;erted, her guardian being abroad, and having nothing to expect from her relations, &s;he cho&s;e to go to &s;ervice, and was recommended to mi&s;s Belmour by the counte&s;s of &mdash;, her kin&s;|woman.</Q></P>
<P>"What a wretch mu&s;t your uncle be!" &s;aid the marquis, with tears in his eyes,
<Q>to per|mit &s;uch excellence&mdash;</Q>
He &s;topped a mo|ment; then &s;uddenly gra&s;ping his hand,
<Q>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my dear Freeman (pur&s;ued he) you have it in your power to make me happy&mdash; You know how ardently I love your charming &s;i&s;ter&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250">"This I was apprehen&s;ive of," interrupted Mr. Courteney.
<Q>I beg, my lord, that you will bani&s;h the&s;e thoughts.</Q></P>
<P>"What!" cried the marquis, ha&s;tily;
<Q>have you any objection to my pa&s;&s;ion for your &s;i&s;ter?</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed I have, and a very &s;trong one," re|plied Mr. Courteney,
<Q>and that is the cer|tainty of the duke your father's di&s;approbation of it.</Q></P>
<P>"It is po&s;&s;ible indeed," &s;aid the marquis, after a little pau&s;e,
<Q>that in the choice of a wife for me, my father will be influenced by the &s;ame motives that mo&s;t fathers are: he will expect a large fortune with the per&s;on I marry; therefore, my dear Charles, you &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity there is for not con&s;ulting him in this ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"Sure you forget, my lord," interrupted Mr. Courteney, coolly,
<Q>what you once de|clared, that you would never enter into an engagement of this kind, contrary to the duke's inclinations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I remember I &s;aid &s;o (replied the mar|quis; and were I to make a choice which he could rea&s;onably object to, certainly it would be wrong, very wrong to di&s;obey him: but if the want of a fortune can make my father

di&s;approve of my affection for a young lady of mi&s;s Courteney's birth and merit, mu&s;t I be governed by &s;uch &s;ordid motives?</Q></P>
<P>The marquis went on to prove, by a great many arguments common enough on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, that in the article of marriage, a parent had no right to lay any re&s;traint upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch nations of his child. Mr. Courteney did not think proper to enter into a di&s;pute with him upon this &s;ubject: the patience with which he li&s;tened to him, made the young nobleman con|clude he was not unwilling to come into his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P><Q>My dear Charles (added he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e) will you not be my advocate with your charming &s;i&s;ter? I die with impatience to throw my&s;elf at her feet, and offer her my heart and hand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You cannot doubt, my lord (&s;aid Mr. Courteney) but that I think, my &s;i&s;ter highly honoured by the e&s;teem you expre&s;s for her; but &s;he would be very unworthy of it, if &s;he was capable of admitting your addre&s;&s;es, ei|ther unknown to your father, or in oppo&s;i|tion to his will. I may venture to an&s;wer for her, that &s;he will not, by &s;o unju&s;tifiable a con|duct, expo&s;e her brother to cen&s;ure: and it gives me great concern to find you are no better

<P><Q>Then I am to expect nothing from your friend&s;hip on this occa&s;ion, Mr. Courteney!</Q>
replied the marquis, with an air of di&s;plea&s;ure:
<Q>you are determined to rai&s;e difficulties to my de&s;ign, in&s;tead of removing them; is this act|ing like a man whom I have loved like a brother, and whom it would be my highe&s;t happine&s;s to call &s;o.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To call you brother with your father's con|&s;ent, my lord (&s;aid Mr. Courteney) is an ho|nour I cannot hope for, and which without it I do not wi&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As noble and di&s;intere&s;ted as you imagine this conduct to be (&s;aid the marquis, ri&s;ing) it will have another name perhaps with per|&s;ons le&s;s romantic in their notions than you are, However, &s;ir, you are no more than the brother of mi&s;s Courteney; if I am happy enough to prevail with her to receive my ad|dre&s;&s;es, I &s;hall not think your con&s;ent nece&s;|&s;ary.</Q>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which we are afraid &s;ome of our readers will think Mr. Courteney acts a very &s;illy part.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Courteney &s;aw plainly, that by re|fu&s;ing to comply with his pupil's de&s;ires, he &s;hould entirely lo&s;e his friend&s;hip, but in a ca&s;e where his honour was &s;o greatly concerned, this con&s;ideration had no weight with him: and although he had a high opinion of his &s;i&s;ter's candor and integrity, yet the intimation mi&s;s Belmour had given him of her regard for Mr. Melvil, made him apprehen&s;ive that &s;he might be prevailed upon to li&s;ten to the vows of the marquis of&mdash;. He re&s;olved therefore to keep the place of her abode a &s;ecret (for he knew he could depend upon the prudence of Mr. Knight and his wife) and to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endea|vours to ha&s;ten the young lord's departure from France.</P>
<P>The marquis, mean time, was forming very different de&s;igns. It is &s;o rare a thing for a man in love to be either rea&s;onable or ju&s;t, on occa|&s;ions where the intere&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ion is con|cerned, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing the marquis
<PB N="247" REF="254">
&s;hould impute his governor's conduct with re|gard to his &s;i&s;ter to peevi&s;hne&s;s and caprice, and think him&s;elf extremely ill u&s;ed by his not accepting his offers. He conceived mi&s;s Cour|teney to be equally injured by the oppo&s;ition her brother made to the advancement of her for|tune; and flattering him&s;elf that, if his per&s;on was not di&s;agreeable to her, he &s;hould &s;oon overcome any &s;cruples Mr. Courteney might have &s;ugge&s;ted on account of the duke his fa|ther's di&s;approbation, he determined to con&s;ult him no further in the affair, but to addre&s;s him|&s;elf directly to her.</P>
<P>He &s;pent part of the night in writing a letter to her, in which he declared his pa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t tender and re&s;pectful terms, and begged &s;he would allow him to wait upon her. The remaining hours were not &s;pent in &s;leep, but in impatient longings for the morning, which was to confirm or de&s;troy his hopes. As &s;oon as it was light, he ro&s;e and walked about his room. He read over the letter he had written; he thought it but poorly expre&s;&s;ed the ardor of his love: he &s;at down and wrote another, which he liked &s;till le&s;s, and had recour&s;e again to the fir&s;t, after adding a po&s;t&s;cript, in which he ear|ne&s;tly repeated his reque&s;t to be indulged with a few moments private di&s;cour&s;e with her.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="255">He &s;ealed up his letter, and directed it for mi&s;s Courteney. Her brother had not men|tioned to him his having removed her from mi&s;s Belmour: he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was &s;till with her; but a doubt occurring to him, whether &s;he was will|ing to a&s;&s;ume her real name yet, he thought it be&s;t to put it in another cover, &s;uper&s;cribed for mi&s;s Ben&s;on.</P>
<P>It was &s;till too early to &s;end to a lady's lodg|ings; he counted the hours with anxious impa|tience, and at length rung his bell for his &s;ervant. As &s;oon as he appeared, he gave him the letter, recommending &s;ecrecy, and charging him not to return without an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The valet, when he came back, brought him word that mi&s;s Ben&s;on was gone; and this was all the intelligence he could get. Mi&s;s Bel|mour's woman indeed had added with a &s;neer, that &s;he went off with Mr. Freeman, and it was &s;trange that his friend Mr. Melvil &s;hould not know where &s;he was. This part of the me&s;|&s;age the fellow prudently &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; for he judged the bu&s;ine&s;s to be an amour, and that the young gentlemen were rivals, and he was afraid of making mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The marquis, however, ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed that this &s;udden removal of mi&s;s Courteney was her brother's act: he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervant; and
<PB N="249" REF="256">
beginning now to be &s;en&s;ible how much it was in his governor's power to traver&s;e his de&s;igns, and how ob&s;tinately he was bent upon doing &s;o, he re&s;igned him&s;elf up to the mo&s;t violent tran&s;|ports of rage; and, during a few moments, all his thoughts ran upon revenge.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney came into his chamber while he was under the&s;e agitations; and, &s;eeing him walking about with a furious pace,
<Q>For Hea|ven's &s;ake, my lord (&s;aid he) what is the matter with you?</Q></P>
<P>The marquis turned &s;hort upon him, and, with a voice broken with pa&s;&s;ion, exclaimed, "May I peri&s;h, Courteney, if I forgive you."</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney, who &s;uppo&s;ed this re&s;entment was the con&s;equence of their conver&s;ation the night before, replied calmly,
<Q>You are angry, my lord&mdash;This is no time to talk.</Q></P>
<P>He was going out of the room, but the mar|quis, ha&s;tily &s;tepping between him and the door, &s;hut it with great violence.</P>
<P>"If it is not your time to talk, &s;ir, it is mine," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Very well, my lord," replied Mr. Court|ney, with a compo&s;ed look and accent,
<Q>I am ready to hear you.</Q></P>
<P>The young nobleman continued to walk in a fullen &s;ilence, as if re&s;olved to be angry, and
<PB N="250" REF="257">
knew not well what cau&s;e to a&s;&s;ign for it; when &s;uddenly &s;topping,</P>
<P><Q>I in&s;i&s;t upon your telling me, &s;ir (&s;aid he) why you have &s;ecreted your &s;i&s;ter? Do you &s;u&s;pect I have di&s;honourable de&s;igns upon her?</Q></P>
<P>"Di&s;honourable de&s;igns upon my &s;i&s;ter" repeated Mr. Courteney, kindling at the ex|pre&s;&s;ion:
<Q>my lord, no man, while I have life, &s;hall incur &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion with impu|nity.</Q></P>
<P>"This &s;pirit becomes one of your birth," replied the marquis;
<Q>but let me tell you, Mr. Courteney, your conduct is not altogether con&s;i&s;tent; why mu&s;t your &s;i&s;ter be hurried, no body knows whither, and concealed with &s;uch wonderful caution?</Q></P>
<P>"Are you &s;ure this is the ca&s;e, my lord?" &s;aid Mr. Courteney.</P>
<P>"Yes, very &s;ure," an&s;wered the marquis, ha&s;tily.</P>
<P><Q>Since it was not I who gave your lord&s;hip this information,</Q>
re&s;umed Mr. Courteney,
<Q>you mu&s;t have taken &s;ome trouble to come to the knowledge of it; and the motive that &s;et you upon the&s;e enquiries &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifies my caution with regard to my &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="258">
<Q>Then I am not worthy, it &s;eems, to pay my addre&s;&s;es &s;o your &s;i&s;ter,</Q>
&s;aid the marquis, peevi&s;hly.</P>
<P><Q>Indeed, my lord, this is a very childi&s;h &s;peech,</Q>
replied Mr. Courteney;
<Q>you know your addre&s;&s;es would do honour to any wo|man: but the depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of my &s;i&s;ter's fortune leaves her no right to expect a man of your quality for a husband; and &s;he has too ju&s;t a pride to &s;ubmit to make a clande&s;tine marriage; nor will I be branded with the im|putation of having &s;educed my pupil into a marriage with my &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>"What have you to do with the affair at all?" replied the marquis, eagerly:
<Q>leave mi&s;s Cour|teney to act as &s;he thinks proper; you need not make your&s;elf an&s;werable for my conduct on this occa&s;ion, I loved her before I knew her to be your &s;i&s;ter; cannot your romantic honour &s;atisfy it&s;elf with being pa&s;&s;ive in this bu&s;ine&s;s?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould but ill perform my engagements to your father, my lord,</Q>
interrupted Mr. Courteney,
<Q>if I did not u&s;e my utmo&s;t endea|vours to prevent you from di&s;plea&s;ing him in a matter of &s;o great importance as your mar|riage.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="259"><Q>How are you &s;ure my father will be di&s;|plea&s;ed?</Q>
&s;aid the marquis:
<Q>mi&s;s Courte|ney's merit will ju&s;tify my choice.</Q></P>
<P>"Put it upon that i&s;&s;ue," replied Mr. Cour|teney; "a&s;k his con&s;ent."</P>
<P>"Well, &s;ir, I will a&s;k his con&s;ent," re&s;umed the marquis;

<P><Q>If you intend, my lord, to be governed by the duke's advice (&s;aid Mr. Courteney) you will certainly be contented to wait his an&s;wer; and you cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that knowing your &s;entiments &s;o well as I do, I will permit my &s;i&s;ter to receive your vi&s;its while we are igno|rant of the duke's intentions.</Q></P>
<P>The marquis lo&s;t all patience at this unrea|&s;onable ob&s;tinacy, as he conceived it.
<Q>I re|nounce your friend&s;hip from this moment (&s;aid he) for ever; and, had you not a &s;i&s;ter, I would re&s;ent this behaviour in ano|ther manner.</Q></P>
<P>He flung out of the room when he had &s;aid this; and, &s;hutting him&s;elf up in his &s;tudy, gave his valet orders to allow no body to di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney was not &s;o much offended at the har&s;hne&s;s of his language, as to hinder him from feeling great concern for the unea&s;y &s;tate

of his mind; and, notwith&s;tanding his own temper was vehement enough, yet he was able to make &s;ome allowances for the tran&s;ports of a young man, who &s;aw him&s;elf &s;o re&s;olutely op|po&s;ed in a point he had &s;et his heart upon: but de&s;pairing to pacify his pupil without entering into his de&s;ign, he determined to place his &s;i&s;ter effectually out of his reach, and then, if he could not prevail upon him to return to England, no|thing remained but to make the duke his father acquainted with the whole affair.</P>
<P>He waited &s;ome time in expectation that the marquis would come down to breakfa&s;t as u&s;ual; but, finding that he had ordered his chocolate to be brought to him in his &s;tudy, he went to vi&s;it his &s;i&s;ter, as he had promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The marquis heard him, as he pa&s;&s;ed by his door, call for his hat and &s;word; and, his valet entering a moment afterwards with the chocolate, he a&s;ked him, if Mr. Freeman was gone out? Being an&s;wered that he was, it &s;uddenly came into his head, that he was going to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter.</P>

When he got into the &s;treet, he perceived Mr. Cour|teney walking lei&s;urely on: he followed him at a di&s;tance, took particular notice of the hou&s;e he entered; and, after waiting a few moments to &s;ee whether he came out again, he went back to the marquis with his intelligence.</P>
<P>The young lover did not doubt but he had di&s;covered his mi&s;tre&s;s's abode; and in the joy this thought gave him, he be&s;towed many prai&s;es on his valet's ingenuity, together with a reward of two Louis d' ors more, which he liked &s;till better. He then ordered him to give directions for his chariot to be got ready, while he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to dre&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Mr. Courteney gives more in&s;tances of his folly.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE Henrietta thus innocently &s;owed the &s;eeds of di&s;cord between the two friends, &s;he her&s;elf enjoyed a perfect compo|&s;ure of mind, and indulged the mo&s;t plea&s;ing reflections on the happy change of her for|tune.</P>
<P>She was no longer in the humiliating condi|tion of a &s;ervant; or, what to her was far more mortifying, a dependant upon the bounty of an|other; an unknown wanderer, without friends or protectors. She was now under the care of a brother, whom &s;he tenderly loved, who&s;e merit could not fail of di&s;tingui&s;hing him, and of forcing that re&s;pect and con&s;ideration due to a noble birth, and which he, though in a depre&s;t fortune, &s;o nobly &s;upported.</P>
<P>She was a&s;&s;ured that her guardian was not only free from any unfavourable prejudices on account of her aunt's de&s;ertion of her, but that &s;he might expect all the tender offices of a parent from him; and, what afforded the nice &s;en&s;ibility of her &s;oul a more delicate &s;atisfaction than all this,
<PB N="256" REF="263">
the only man in the world whom &s;he was capa|ble of regarding, with a preference to the re&s;t of his &s;ex; though, in &s;o elevated a rank, had loved her in indigence and ob&s;curity with honour, and ju&s;tified the tender &s;entiments &s;he entertained for him.</P>
<P>Her &s;miles, when &s;he &s;aw her brother appear, and the gaiety of her behaviour, convinced him, her mind was at ea&s;e; but his features &s;till re|tained that impre&s;&s;ion of chagrin he had &s;o lately felt from the marquis's cau&s;ele&s;s rage; and there was a &s;olemnity in his manner, that, in an in|&s;tant, changed the innocent chearfulne&s;s of Hen|rietta into anxiety and concern.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of Mrs. Knight was a re&s;traint upon them both. She perceived it; and as &s;oon as the tea-table was removed (for the ladies were at breakfa&s;t when Mr. Courteney came in) &s;he retired and left them at liberty.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he was gone, Henrietta eagerly a&s;ked him, if any thing had happened to give him unea&s;ine&s;s &s;ince &s;he &s;aw him?</P>
<P><Q>Yes (replied he abruptly) the marquis and I have quarrelled.</Q></P>
<P>"Quarrelled!" repeated Henrietta, trem|bling and pale as death,
<Q>have you qua|relled?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="264">Mr. Courteney, who ob&s;erved her emotion, continued to look at her &s;o earne&s;tly that &s;he blu&s;hed and ca&s;t down her eyes.
<Q>You &s;eem greatly affected with this accident (&s;aid he at la&s;t) I wi&s;h I had not mentioned it to you.</Q></P>
<P>"Could you &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Henrietta, in an accent which had at lea&s;t as much of grief as tenderne&s;s in it,
<Q>that I could hear with indif|ference what mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be very afflicting to you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your indifference perhaps, on this occa|&s;ion (&s;aid Mr. Courteney) would be more welcome to me than the concern I &s;ee you under.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta having pondered a little on the meaning of the&s;e words, replied in a firmer tone,
<Q>place &s;ome confidence in me, brother, you will find I &s;hall de&s;erve it.</Q></P>
<P>"My dear Henrietta," re&s;umed Mr. Cour|teney, affected with the manner in which &s;he &s;poke, and her expre&s;&s;ive look,
<Q>you ought to forgive my doubts, when you reflect on what mi&s;s Belmour told me; the merit of my noble pupil has made an impre&s;&s;ion on your heart; but your marriage with him, &s;i&s;ter, will bring everla&s;ting infamy upon me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Have I not already declared my re&s;olution to you upon this head?</Q>
replied Henrietta.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="265">"The marquis loves you," re&s;umed Mr. Cour|teney:
<Q>he is ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate; he has no hope (and indeed it would be &s;trange if he had) that the duke his father will con&s;ent to &s;uch an unequal match; yet he pre&s;&s;es me to introduce him to you as a lover, and to favour his de&s;igns of marrying you privately. You may ea&s;ily imagine what an&s;wer I gave him; the con&s;equence is, that he has de|clared him&s;elf my enemy. We are upon very bad terms. But this is not my greate&s;t con|cern: the marquis, if he can get acce&s;s to you, will teaze you with &s;olicitations; and, di&s;po&s;ed as you are in his favour, have I not cau&s;e to apprehend you will li&s;ten to him but too readily?</Q></P>
<P>"Although I &s;hould confirm your &s;u&s;picions," &s;aid Henrietta, with tears in her eyes,
<Q>yet I mu&s;t again repeat I am grieved at this differ|ence between your pupil and you. Nay I will own,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, avoiding with a &s;weet ba&s;hfulne&s;s the earne&s;t looks of her brother,
<Q>that I am not in&s;en&s;ible of this young noble|man's affection for me; but, after this candid confe&s;&s;ion, you ought to believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I will enter into no engage|ment with him without your approbation and to make you ea&s;y, I will comply with
<PB N="259" REF="266">
any mea&s;ures you think proper, to avoid his pur&s;uits.</Q></P>
<P>"I &s;ee I may rely upon you," &s;aid Mr. Cour|teney, charmed with her amiable frankne&s;s;
<Q>but, my dear Henrietta, I hope you will not allow this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to take too deep root in your heart: &s;ure your good &s;en&s;e, and the delicacy of your &s;entiments, will hinder you from giving way to a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>"I beg you not to talk to me on this &s;ubject," interrupted Henrietta, tears, in &s;pite of her en|deavours to re&s;train them, flowing fa&s;t down her face;
<Q>only tell me what you would have me do to avoid the marquis: have you formed any plan? Doubt not of my readine&s;s to com|ply with it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Have you any objections to boarding in a convent till Mr. Bale comes?</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Cour|teney.</P>
<P><Q>No (replied Henrietta, half &s;miling) for I cannot &s;u&s;pect you have a de&s;ign upon my re|ligion, as my aunt had, and mean to confine me all my life.</Q></P>
<P>"No, really," re&s;umed Mr. Courteney, &s;miling likewi&s;e;
<Q>but it will be more difficult for the marquis to get acce&s;s to you in a con|vent than here; and as it is probable enough that this affair will make &s;ome noi&s;e, it will
<PB N="260" REF="267">
be more for your reputation to have it known that you lived in &s;uch a re&s;pectable &s;ociety, where there were &s;o many witne&s;&s;es of your conduct, and &s;uch exact regularity required, than in private lodgings, where you were ac|countable to no body for your actions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then you intend to leave me before Mr. Bale comes?</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta, &s;ighing.</P>
<P><Q>To be &s;ure (replied Mr. Courteney) I will force the marquis away if po&s;&s;ible; and if I find all my remon&s;trances ineffectual, the duke mu&s;t interpo&s;e his authority.</Q></P>
<P>"You intend to write to him then?" &s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P><Q>Certainly (replied he) don't you think I ought to do &s;o, &s;i&s;ter?</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed I do," an&s;wered &s;he.</P>
<P><Q>I am glad of it (re&s;umed Mr. Courteney) yet this procedure will embroil me more with the marquis; but I &s;ee no help for it, unle&s;s Mr. Bale &s;hould happen to come &s;ooner than we expect, and take you with him to England I hope to prevail upon my pupil to have Paris in two or three days; and if I have not the &s;a|tisfaction to leave you under Mr. Bale's care, convent is the fitte&s;t place for you to retire to.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, having reflected on her brother's propo&s;al, found it &s;o rea&s;onable, and &s;o much t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="261" REF="268">
the advantage of her reputation, that &s;he rea|dily yielded to put it in immediate execution.</P>
<P>Mrs. Knight being de&s;ired to return, Mr. Courteney told her their de&s;ign, and reque&s;ted her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern at being &s;o &s;oon to lo&s;e her agreeable gue&s;t, but undertook to tran&s;act: the affair; and it was re|&s;olved that &s;he &s;hould go that day, and procure the young lady to be admitted as a pen&s;ioner in the Augu&s;tine nunnery of Engli&s;h ladies in Paris.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney, having promi&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter to come and conduct her to the convent the next day, took leave of her, highly &s;atisfied with her docility, and returned home. He was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that the marquis was gone abroad; but having no &s;u&s;picion of his intention to vi&s;it Hen|rietta, who&s;e abode he concluded was &s;till a &s;e|cret to him, he was only concerned left his health &s;hould &s;uffer, by venturing out before it was fully re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The marquis's valet no &s;ooner &s;aw Mr. Cour|teney return, than he ran immediately to ac|quaint his ma&s;ter, who &s;et forwards, with a beating heart, to vi&s;it his mi&s;tre&s;s. The valet had given &s;o exact a direction, that the coach-man had no difficulty to find the hou&s;e. The marquis alighted the moment the door was opened, and asking the &s;ervant for mi&s;s Courte|ney,
<PB N="262" REF="269">
was in&s;tantly introduced into a parlour, where Henrietta was &s;itting alone, Mrs. Knight having ju&s;t left her to go and execute her com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of the marquis threw her into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. She ro&s;e, however, and re|ceived him with great re&s;pect: he approached her bowing, and made her a genteel compli|ment upon her happy meeting with her bro|ther.</P>
<P>Henrietta would not &s;uffer this &s;ubject to be dwelt upon long, left it &s;hould lead to circum|&s;tances too intere&s;ting. She changed the con|ver&s;ation to indifferent matters, and took care that it &s;hould not flag a moment; &s;o that the marquis, partly embarra&s;&s;ed by that awe which always accompanies a &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion, and partly by the prudent management of Henrietta, found he had protracted his vi&s;it to a con&s;iderable length, without drawing any advantage from it.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the thoughts of lo&s;ing an opportu|nity, which the rigid and inflexible temper of his governor might prevent him from meeting with again, he &s;uddenly a&s;&s;umed courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> make her a declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> terms the mo&s;t tender and re&s;pectful, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an explicitne&s;s that became one of his rank a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

fortune, to u&s;e towards a young lady in her deli|cate circum&s;tances, whom he would not for a moment leave in doubt of the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, and his firm re&s;olution to adhere to them.</P>
<P>Henrietta li&s;tened to him with a graceful mo|de&s;ty; and when he earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed for her an|&s;wer, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he was very &s;en|&s;ible of the honour he did her, and &s;hould always think her&s;elf obliged to him for having enter|tained &s;uch favourable &s;entiments of her, as could make him overlook the inequality there was be|tween them. As for the re&s;t, &s;he referred him to her brother, who, &s;he &s;aid, was in the place of a father to her, and by who&s;e advice and di|rection &s;he was determined to be governed en|tirely.</P>
<P>The marquis would have had no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, if he had not known that he had nothing to expect from an applica|tion to her brother, and the apprehen&s;ion that &s;he al&s;o knew it, and therefore took this me|thod to free her&s;elf from his importunities, gave him &s;o much concern, that he turned pale, and &s;ighing, fixed his eyes upon the ground. His air, his attitude, his looks, were all &s;o mov|ing, &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of tenderne&s;s, anxiety, and grief, that Henrietta dur&s;t not tru&s;t her&s;elf to
<PB N="264" REF="271">
behold him, le&s;t he &s;hould turn his eyes towards her, and di&s;cover in her's the too great intere&s;t &s;he took in his unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Some moments pa&s;&s;ed in an affecting &s;ilence on both &s;ides, during which the marquis re|mained immoveably fixed in the &s;ame pen&s;ive po&s;ture, till rouzed by the opening of the door, and the appearance of Mr. Courteney. Hen|rietta's face was in an in&s;tant covered with blu&s;hes: the marquis &s;eemed greatly embar|ra&s;&s;ed. Mr. Courteney &s;hewed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at fir&s;t; but, recovering him&s;elf, he &s;poke to his pupil with an ea&s;y air, and relieved both him and his &s;i&s;ter from their confu&s;ion, by enter|ing immediately into an indifferent conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>The marquis drew a favourable omen from this behaviour: his looks re&s;umed their u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s and vivacity; and, during a who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hour that they continued together, nothing cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be more &s;pirited and lively than the di&s;cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> between three per&s;ons, who had the mo&s;t per|fect tenderne&s;s for one another, yet, from the &s;everal circum&s;tances, were obliged mutually oppo&s;e and give pain.</P>
<P>The marquis at length, with apparent relu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tance, put an end to his vi&s;it, as did Mr. Cour|teney likewi&s;e, though he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

talking to his &s;i&s;ter in private. When they were in the chariot together, the young lord was &s;e|veral times upon the point of pre&s;&s;ing his go|vernor again upon the &s;ubject of his love, as he &s;eemed to be le&s;s inclined than formerly to op|po&s;e him; but he was re&s;trained from entering into any explanation, by his apprehen&s;ion of de|&s;troying tho&s;e hopes he had &s;o lately began to en|tertain, and of rendering his acce&s;s to Hen|rietta more difficult for the future: Mr. Cour|teney al&s;o had his rea&s;ons for preventing any &s;uch explanation, and indu&s;triou&s;ly amu&s;ed him with other di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The marquis could not help thinking it &s;trange that he took no notice of the vi&s;it he had made his &s;i&s;ter: but as love is ever ready to flatter its own wi&s;hes, he began to imagine that Mr. Courteney had relaxed in the &s;everity of his re|&s;olutions, but knew not yet how to yield with a good grace; he favoured his embarra&s;&s;ment therefore for the pre&s;ent, and they pa&s;&s;ed the re|maining part of the day in their u&s;ual company and diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>When they came home at night, the marquis de&s;ired to have an hour's conver&s;ation with him; but Mr. Courteney, complaining of a &s;udden head-ach, excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and retired to his own chamber.</P>

<P>THE marquis, when he &s;aw him enter his chamber, approached him with an obliging air, and affectionately pre&s;&s;ing his hand,</P>
<P><Q>May I hope, my dear Courteney (&s;aid he) that you have overcome your fanta&s;tic &s;cruples, and that you will favour my preten&s;ions to your charming &s;i&s;ter. I will make you no apology for &s;tealing a vi&s;it to her; you would, I am &s;ure, have done the &s;ame in my &s;ituation. In|deed, Charles, you mu&s;t either re&s;olve to give me mi&s;s Courteney, or to &s;ee me mi&s;erable.

<P>"You know, my lord," replied Mr. Cour|teney,
<Q>that there is not any thing you can de&s;ire of me, con&s;i&s;tent with my honour, which I would refu&s;e; but, unle&s;s I would make my|&s;elf infamous, I cannot yield to your marry|ing my &s;i&s;ter without the duke's con&s;ent.
<PB N="268" REF="275">
Hear what I have to propo&s;e,</Q>
continued he, perceiving him to be in a violent emotion;
<Q>let us return to England immediately. You have often told me, that the duke is a mo&s;t tender father; you are an only child: it is po&s;&s;ible he may be prevailed upon to yield to your de|&s;ires, if you tell him you cannot be happy without my &s;i&s;ter. Let us make the trial at lea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>"I agree to it," interrupted the marquis, eagerly,
<Q>provided you will promi&s;e me, that if my father is &s;o unrea&s;onable as to refu&s;e his con&s;ent, you will no longer oppo&s;e my mar|riage. I am of age; it is fit, that in a matter of &s;uch importance to the future happine&s;s of my whole life, I &s;hould be at liberty to follow my inclinations.

<P>"Indeed, I will not, my lord," replied Mr. Courteney, "you mu&s;t not expect it."</P>
<P>"Dete&s;ted ob&s;tinacy!" cried the marquis, flinging his hand away, which he had held till this moment,
<Q>what a wretch am I to have my happine&s;s depend upon the will of a capricious man, who mikakes his romantic whims for honour! But ob&s;erve what I &s;ay, Courteney,</Q>
added he, turning ha&s;tily towards him,

<P>"Gone to a convent!" repeated the marquis; "this is your &s;cheme, I &s;uppo&s;e."</P>
<P>"I hoped to prevail upon you," &s;aid Mr. Courteney,
<Q>&s;ince you are quite recovered, to leave Paris immediately; and I thought a convent the propere&s;t place for my &s;i&s;ter to re|&s;ide in till her guardian comes.</Q></P>
<P>The marquis in&s;tantly running over in his thoughts the u&s;e that might be made of this in|telligence, replied, that he had no inclination to leave Paris yet; and broke off all farther conver&s;ation by quitting the room.</P>
<P>In effect, he had re&s;olved to make an applica|tion to Mr. Bale, &s;uppo&s;ing, that &s;ince he had not the &s;ame foundation for &s;cruples as his go|vernor, he would readily li&s;ten to an offer &s;o ad|vantageous for his ward.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney penetrated into his views, and doubtful how Mr. Bale would act, and whether his &s;i&s;ter, having the &s;anction of his approba|tion,

<P>The marquis, full of hope that his new &s;cheme would be &s;ucce&s;sful, made no effort to &s;ee Henrietta, for fear of rai&s;ing &s;u&s;picions in her brother: but the coldne&s;s and re&s;erve with which he treated him, &s;ufficiently &s;hewed how much he re&s;ented his conduct.</P>
<P>Henrietta was &s;oon reconciled to a retire|ment, in which &s;he had full liberty to indulge her reflections; for &s;he was in love enough to find more &s;atisfaction in being alone, than in the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable &s;ociety. Her bro|ther did not fail to vi&s;it her every day: he found her &s;atisfied with her &s;ituation; and, in appear|ance, no otherwi&s;e affected with his approach|ing departure, which he gave her room to expect, than what her tenderne&s;s for him might well allow of.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278">In the mean time the duke of&mdash;, hav|ing received Mr. Courteney's letter, was greatly plea&s;ed with the noblene&s;s and genero&s;ity of his behaviour.

<P>The packet, to avoid &s;u&s;picion, had been di|rected as u&s;ual to the marquis, who was not &s;urpri&s;ed to find a letter in it for Mr. Cour|teney, to whom his father was accu&s;tomed to write often: he &s;ent it to him immediately; and, after reading his own, he went to Mr. Courteney's chamber, holding it &s;till in his hand.</P>
<P><Q>My father writes to me (&s;aid he) to leave Paris as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. He does not ex|pre&s;ly &s;ay that he is ill; but, from &s;ome hints in his letter, I can collect that this is the cau&s;e of his extreme earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;ee me. You cannot imagine how much I am affected with this accident (pur&s;ued he, &s;ighing). I love my father: I did not know how much I loved him, till I feared his lo&s;s. I am determined to &s;et out to-morrow from Paris; but I mu&s;t &s;ee your &s;i&s;ter fir&s;t, Courteney, nor ought you

<P>"Well, my lord," replied Mr. Courteney, after a little pau&s;e,
<Q>we will go together, and take leave of my &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was to blame (&s;aid the marquis) to expect any indulgence from you: we will go toge|ther then, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o.</Q>
He retired again to his own apartment to write to his fa|ther; and in the mean time Mr. Courteney gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders for their journey the next morning.</P>
<P>Henrietta had been prepared by a billet from her brother, for the vi&s;it that was intended her. The news of their departure had co&s;t her &s;ome tears; but when &s;he was informed they waited for her in the parlour of the convent, &s;he ap|peared before them with all that &s;oft compo&s;ure and dignity of manners, which never for&s;ook her in the mo&s;t trying &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney watched the turn of his countenance when the marquis acco&s;ted her, and was plea&s;ed to &s;ee it equally free from embarra&s;&s;ment and affectation; and that, not|with&s;tanding all the expre&s;&s;ive language of her lover's eyes, &s;he had &s;o much command over
<PB N="273" REF="280">
her&s;elf, as to &s;eem the lea&s;t intere&s;ted per&s;on in company.</P>
<P>Politene&s;s obliged the marquis to &s;horten his vi&s;it, that the brother and &s;i&s;ter might be at li|berty to take a private leave of each other. He ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and approached Henrietta, with an air that left her no room to doubt of his intention to &s;ay &s;omething particular to her; and now, for the fir&s;t time, her looks betrayed &s;ome little confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>I cannot go away, madam (&s;aid he) with|out renewing the declaration I made you &s;ome days ago; and I take this opportunity to a&s;&s;ure you, before your brother, who knows the &s;incerity of my heart, that my &s;entiments for you will ever be the &s;ame: and, if you do not forbid it, I will carry away with me the dear hope of being able one day to merit your e&s;teem.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta courtefied in &s;ilence; but her blu&s;hes, and the &s;oft confu&s;ion &s;he was in, &s;eemed no un|favourable omen for the marquis: he bowed re|&s;pectfully, and retired.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney, affecting not to perceive his &s;i&s;ter's concern, entered immediately after his pupil's departure into other di&s;cour&s;e. He re|commended it to her to improve her guardian's e&s;teem for her, and a&s;&s;ured her he would vi&s;it

He charged her to keep up no &s;ort of intimacy with mi&s;s Belmour, though &s;he &s;hould &s;eek it, but permitted her, in company with Mr. Bale, to pay her a farewel vi&s;it; and, indeed, the conduct of that young lady, &s;ince the arrival of Mr. Campley, ju&s;tified the&s;e pre|cautions.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Courteney, when he came within a &s;hort di&s;tance of London, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the duke's &s;ervant, with compliments to his grace and the marquis, and proceeded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his journey. It came into his head to alight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the hou&s;e of Mrs. Willis, from whom it was po&s;&s;ible he might receive &s;ome intelligence that would be of u&s;e to him. The good woman received him with great civility; but, when he told her his name, &s;he was in tran&s;ports, and enquired for her be|loved mi&s;s Courteney with the tender anxiety of a mother.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney told her, that his &s;i&s;ter would &s;oon be in London with her guardian. He took occa&s;ion to thank her for her friendly care of her, which Henrietta had mentioned with the utmo&s;t gratitude; and a&s;&s;ured her, he &s;hould always con|&s;ider him&s;elf as highly obliged to her.</P>
<P><Q>How largely do I &s;hare in my dear mi&s;s Courteney's joy (&s;aid &s;he) for &s;o happy a meeting with her beloved brother! Heaven will, I doubt not, &s;hower its ble&s;&s;ings on her;
<PB N="278" REF="285">
for &s;ure if ever mortal de&s;erved them &s;he does, O! &s;ir, your &s;i&s;ter is an angelic creature&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Willis, indulging the tender effu&s;ions of her heart, continued to expatiate on Henrietta's virtues, till Mr. Courteney, though not di&s;|plea&s;ed to hear her, interrupted her, to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions concerning his aunt.</P>
<P><Q>I was going to write to mi&s;s Courteney to|day, &s;ir (replied &s;he) for I have great news to acquaint her with: that vile prie&s;t, who was the cau&s;e of all her unea&s;ine&s;s, has at length &s;hewn him&s;elf in his true colours. The &s;anc|tified hypocrite was detected in an amour with lady Meadows's woman: this affair has opened her eyes; &s;he thinks her niece has been greatly injured by the mi&s;repre&s;entations of this wretch, whom &s;he has di&s;carded with infamy; and the fir&s;t proof &s;he has given of her favourable di&s;|po&s;ition towards mi&s;s Courteney, was her taking again her former woman, whom &s;he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on account of her attachment to the young lady. I had this intelligence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mrs. White her&s;elf; for &s;o your aunt wo|man, &s;ir, is called. She &s;ays &s;he does not doubt but her lady will write to mi&s;s Courte|ney in the mo&s;t tender manner, and invite her home again.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="286">This news gave Mr. Courteney great &s;atisfac|tion: he re&s;olved not to delay a moment vi&s;iting his aunt; his portmantua had been carried into a chamber, by Mrs. Willis's directions, and thi|ther he retired to dre&s;s. As &s;oon as he was ready, he got into a hackney-coach, and fraught with a thou&s;and kind wi&s;hes from this faithful friend of his &s;i&s;ter, he proceeded to the hou&s;e of lady Meadows.</P>
<P>He was &s;o lucky as to find her at home, and &s;ent in his name without any he&s;itation. The old lady, in a violent flutter of &s;pirits, advanced as far as the door of her apartment to meet her nephew. His graceful form and polite addre&s;s prejudiced her in&s;tantly in his favour; and &s;he re|ceived him with all the tenderne&s;s he could have wi&s;hed, and with much more than he expected.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t enquiries were for Henrietta. Mr. Courteney was plea&s;ed with this &s;olicitude; but he ob&s;erved that, during the cour&s;e of their con|ver&s;ation, her attention with regard to his &s;i&s;ter, decrea&s;ed con&s;iderably. He prai&s;ed her with all the mode&s;ty, yet with all the affection of a bro|ther.</P>
<P>Lady Meadows, who had heard a very advan|tageous account of her niece from the counte&s;s, her good friend, a&s;&s;ured him that &s;he knew his &s;i&s;ter's merit, and had re&s;tored her to that ten|derne&s;s
<PB N="280" REF="287">
and e&s;teem, which &s;ome little errors of her's, and &s;ome unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions of her own, which had been artfully infu&s;ed into her, had robbed her of. She expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction at hearing of her guardian's kindne&s;s: but her words, "I hope he will do &s;omething for her." gave Mr. Courteney great concern; who, from the fir&s;t moment that he had heard Henrietta was likely to recover her favour, had formed a &s;cheme to make her and the marquis happy.</P>
<P>Lady Meadows perceived that he was af|fected with that expre&s;&s;ion: &s;he therefore added that his &s;i&s;ter might depend upon a welcome re|ception from her, whenever &s;he returned to England.</P>
<P>Though there was nothing to object to the words of this declaration, yet there was a great deal to the manner of it. In the coldne&s;s with which &s;he made it, he &s;aw the di&s;appointment of his hopes. In reality, lady Meadows had begun to entertain a prodigious fondne&s;s for her nephew; and Henrietta had now but the &s;econd place in her affection. The longer &s;he con|ver&s;ed with him, the more this fondne&s;s in|crea&s;ed. Women are ever readier to di&s;cover merit in the other &s;ex than their own. Hen|rietta had as many amiable qualities as her bro|ther; but lady Meadows was not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="281" REF="288">
them: and Mr, Courteney made as great a progre&s;s in her affections in three hours, as his &s;i&s;ter had done in as many months.</P>
<P>When he ro&s;e up to take his leave, &s;he de|clared, with &s;ome vehemence, that he mu&s;t have no other home than her hou&s;e.
<Q>You have an aunt (added &s;he, &s;miling) tho' you have no uncle, nor any other relations.</Q>
Mr. Courteney reddened with indignation at the mention of his unworthy uncle; but, recovering him&s;elf, he made her &s;uitable acknowledgments for her kindne&s;s, and, at her de&s;ire, imme|diately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to Mrs. Willis, to acquaint her that he &s;hould not return, and at the &s;ame time &s;ent orders to his &s;ervant to bring his portmantua.</P>
<P>Lady Meadows having given directions for an apartment to be prepared for Mr. Courteney, they pa&s;&s;ed the evening together with great &s;a|tisfaction, particularly on the part of the old lady, who thought her&s;elf extremely happy in having &s;o accompli&s;hed a youth for her nephew. All her thoughts ran upon the plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould have in &s;hewing him to her friends and acquaint|ance, and of piquing his unnatural uncle, by openly profe&s;&s;ing her regard for him.</P>
<P>More than a week after his arrival was &s;pent in a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vi&s;its, to all which
<PB N="282" REF="289">
he attended her; and &s;o ab&s;olutely had he won her heart in that time, that &s;he determined on nothing le&s;s than the making him her &s;ole heir. Mr. Courteney, who was de&s;irous of improving the favour he was in to his &s;i&s;ter's advantage, took all opportunities to revive his aunt's affec|tion for her; &s;o that to plea&s;e him, &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed an impatience to &s;ee her. He received letters from her, and from the duke of &mdash;, the &s;ame day. Henrietta informed him, that &s;he had heard from Mr. Bale, and that &s;he ex|pected him in Paris in a few days: that the af|fairs he had to &s;ettle there, would detain him but a &s;hort time; after which they were to &s;et out immediately for England. She added, that the marquis had wrote to her, and gave him a brief recapitulation of his letter, which &s;eemed to be dictated by the mo&s;t ardent affection, and the &s;tricte&s;t principles of honour.</P>
<P>The duke's letter contained only an earne&s;t reque&s;t to &s;ee him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Lady Meadows was very unwilling to part with him, though he a&s;&s;ured her, he would return in two or three days. He &s;pent part of the night in an&s;wering his &s;i&s;ter's letter, and &s;et out the next morning in a po&s;t-chai&s;e for the duke'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eat: he reached it in the evening at &s;upport time.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="290">He found only the duke and his &s;on at table; in the countenance of the latter, he ob&s;erved a profound melancholy, which &s;en|&s;ibly affected him. The duke received him with great kindne&s;s. The marquis &s;poke little, but &s;eemed plea&s;ed to &s;ee him. The next morn|ing the duke &s;ent for Mr. Courteney into his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>"What &s;hall I do with my &s;on?" &s;aid he to him abruptly, as &s;oon as he entered,
<Q>you &s;ee the way he is in; he will certainly break my heart. I made him a very advantageous propo&s;al three days ago: he tells me po&s;i|tively his heart is engaged; yet he knows I am very de&s;irous the match I mentioned to him &s;hould take place. This is &s;uch an in|&s;tance of ob&s;tinacy and di&s;obedience, as I know not how to pardon. Little did I ima|gine that his return, which I &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;hed for, would be productive of &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s to me.</Q></P>
<P>The duke pau&s;ed here, and looked earne&s;tly at Mr. Courteney, who, not knowing what it was he expected from him, or to what aim his words were directed, continued &s;ilent, with his eyes fixed on the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="291">"I &s;ee you are concerned," re&s;umed the duke,
<Q>for the trouble this unlucky affair gives me.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed I am, my lord, mo&s;t &s;incerely," replied Mr. Courteney.</P>
<P><Q>Then I may depend upon your readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in removing it (&s;aid his grace) hear what I have to propo&s;e&mdash;Your &s;i&s;ter, allowing for the warmth of an admirer's imagination, appears to me, by my &s;on's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|count of her, to have a great deal of merit: &s;uch a young lady cannot be without pre|tenders to her heart. It would give me great plea&s;ure to contribute to her e&s;tabli&s;h|ment: if you have a match in view for her, let me know if I can forward it, either by my pur&s;e or my intere&s;t. I candidly confe&s;s to you, that meer genero&s;ity is not my mo|tive for making you this offer: my &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion is &s;trengthened by hope; when your &s;i&s;ter is married, I may find it le&s;s difficult to prevail upon him to yield me the obedi|ence I require, and which I have a right to expect.&mdash;You do not an&s;wer me, Mr. Cour|teney,</Q>
added his grace, after a little pau&s;e,
<Q>is there any thing di&s;agreeable in this pro|po&s;al?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="292">"Thus pre&s;&s;ed, my lord," replied Mr. Cour|teney,
<Q>it becomes me to &s;peak with plain|ne&s;s and &s;incerity&mdash; I have no power over my &s;i&s;ter's inclinations, and no con&s;ideration whatever &s;hould oblige me to hurry her into a marriage, which her own choice did not direct her to. Be&s;ides, I am not without &s;u&s;picions, that the merit of the marquis has made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on her heart; and, though &s;he has &s;acrificed it to her honour and duty, yet it will for &s;ome time, no doubt, render her deaf to any offer that could be made her. I am very certain, my lord, that &s;he will never encourage the addre&s;&s;es of the marquis without your grace's con&s;ent; but were &s;he capable of acting differently from my hopes and expectations, my honour is concerned to prevent it: and I mo&s;t &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure your grace, that my &s;i&s;ter &s;hall never be the wife of the marquis without your ex|pre&s;s approbation.</Q></P>
<P>The duke could not help being plea&s;ed with the candor and &s;pirit of this reply.
<Q>We mu&s;t leave this affair then as we found it,</Q>
&s;aid he:
<Q>I am &s;o well convinced of your in|tegrity and honour, that I rely upon you en|tirely to prevent any con&s;equences that may be di&s;agreeable to me.</Q></P>

<Q>O! Charles, your &s;i&s;ter is wrapped up in indiffer|ence and re&s;erve; &s;he has not the lea&s;t &s;en&s;i|bility for what I &s;uffer upon her account.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are too generous, my lord (replied Mr. Courteney) to wi&s;h my &s;i&s;ter &s;hould en|courage any &s;entiments for you but tho&s;e of re&s;pect and e&s;teem. It would be pre&s;ump|tion in her to hope for the duke's approba|tion of your pa&s;&s;ion; and were &s;he too &s;en|&s;ible of it, &s;he mu&s;t be unhappy.</Q></P>
<P>"It is enough for me to be unhappy," re|&s;umed the marquis, &s;ighing;
<Q>unhappy in the avarice of my father, to whom I have laid open my whole heart. The want of a for|tune is all the objection he has to mi&s;s Cour|teney; for he appeared charmed with her character, and her birth he knows. Unhappy too, in a rigid friend, who &s;acrifices me to the fanta&s;tic notions he has formed of honour. O! Charles, little did I imagine once that you would have contributed all in your power to make me mi&s;erable.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="296">
<Q>Indeed, my lord (replied Mr. Courteney) this reflection is cruel: this very moment all my thoughts are employed on the means to make you happy.</Q></P>
<P>"Now you are again my friend," interrupted the marquis, embracing him eagerly:
<Q>will you then at la&s;t give me your charming &s;i&s;ter. All that duty can require I have performed: I have implored my father's con&s;ent; he has had the cruelty to refu&s;e it me; and this on a motive &s;o &s;ordid, that I am ju&s;tifiable in fol|lowing my inclinations without &s;oliciting him any more.</Q></P>
<P>"You mi&s;take my intentions, my lord," in|terrupted Mr. Courteney:
<Q>no, never expect that I will con&s;ent to your marrying my &s;i&s;ter without the duke's approbation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What then did you mean (&s;aid the marquis) by the hopes you gave me ju&s;t now?</Q></P>
<P><Q>To prevail, if po&s;&s;ible, upon the duke to con&s;ent to your marriage,</Q>
replied Mr. Cour|teney.</P>
<P>The marquis &s;ighed, and ca&s;t down his eyes, as if hopele&s;s that this expedient would &s;ucceed: but would not &s;ay any thing to divert him from his purpo&s;e: yet he thought it &s;trange that he &s;hould undertake a ta&s;k, which, intere&s;ted as he
<PB N="290" REF="297">
was, &s;eemed le&s;s proper for him than any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr.Courteney gue&s;&s;ed his thoughts, but would not explain him&s;elf any farther. In reality, what the marquis had &s;aid of his father's having no other objection to his choice but the want of a fortune, confirmed him in his de&s;ign of u&s;ing the favour he was in with lady Meadows to the advantage of his &s;i&s;ter; and he was not without expectations of prevailing upon her, by the pro&s;|pect of &s;o honourable a match for her niece, to do as much for her as &s;he had formerly pro|mi&s;ed, in ca&s;e &s;he had married the old ba|ronet.</P>
<P>The marquis, who beheld him earne&s;tly, perceived &s;omething was labouring in his mind, and he began to entertain hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, tho' he knew not on what rea&s;onably to found them. "I cannot," &s;aid Mr. Courteney, ob&s;erving the tender &s;olicitude with which he gazed on him,
<Q>communicate to you the &s;cheme I have formed to reconcile the duke to your wi&s;hes, for rea&s;ons which will be obvious enough here|after. Only thus much I will &s;ay to &s;atisfy you, that I think it is highly probable I &s;hall &s;ucceed; but there is one condition which you mu&s;t yield to, and which I tell you
<PB N="291" REF="298">
plainly is the price I &s;et upon my endeavours to &s;erve you in this affair.</Q></P>
<P>"Name it," interrupted the marquis, eagerly,
<Q>it mu&s;t be a &s;trange one indeed if I do not comply with it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t give me a &s;olemn promi&s;e, my lord (re&s;umed Mr. Courteney) not to &s;eek my &s;i&s;ter's con&s;ent to a clande&s;tine marriage, if I &s;hould fail in my endeavours to procure the duke's approbation, and you mu&s;t make the &s;ame promi&s;e to his grace likewi&s;e.&mdash; Nay, my lord,</Q>
pur&s;ued he, ob&s;erving that he he&s;itated,
<Q>you ri&s;k nothing by entering into this engagement, for I am bound by oath, as well as by honour, to prevent my &s;i&s;ter from being your's upon any terms but the duke's expre&s;s con&s;ent; and, depend upon it, you will never gain her's but on the &s;ame condition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well (replied the marquis) you have my promi&s;e, and I will make the &s;ame declara|tion to my father: it will be time enough to tell him, if your &s;cheme proves un&s;ucce&s;sful, my fixed re&s;olution never to marry at all, if I do not marry mi&s;s Courteney.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Courteney had already gained &s;o impor|tant a point, that he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to combat this re&s;olution at that time. They
<PB N="292" REF="299">
walked together into the hou&s;e; and the mar|quis conceiving that it might be of &s;ome advan|tage to Mr. Courteney's &s;cheme to take an early opportunity of making the promi&s;e he required of him, the duke had that &s;atisfaction in his next private conver&s;ation with his &s;on, and was charmed with this new in&s;tance of Mr. Courte|ney's integrity.</P>
<P>The marquis, after having long puzzled him|&s;elf with conjectures about the de&s;ign Mr. Cour|teney had formed, at length concluded that he had &s;ome expectations from the earl of &mdash;, his uncle, in favour of his &s;i&s;ter; and he was &s;o unfortunately circum&s;tanced between his father's avarice and Mr. Courteney's &s;trict principles of honour, that he was reduced to wi&s;h earne&s;tly for the &s;ucce&s;s of an expedient, which he would have di&s;dained, if he had been ma&s;ter of his own actions. Mr. Courteney at parting, which was in a few days, begged him to rely &s;ecurely upon his friend&s;hip, and to be mindful of the promi&s;e he had given him, which the young lord again confirmed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the hi&s;tory draws near to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Courteney found his &s;hort ab&s;ence had rather endeared him to his aunt, than le&s;&s;ened the ardor of her fondne&s;s; encouraged by her behaviour, he was &s;everal times upon the point of laying open to her the whole affair of his pupil's pa&s;&s;ion for Henrietta, and the dif|ficulties which ob&s;tructed &s;o advantageous a match; difficulties which &s;he could &s;o ea&s;ily re|move: but he hoped a great deal from the pre&s;ence of Henrietta, which it was highly pro|bable would revive the old lady's tenderne&s;s for her, and from the interpo&s;ition of Mr. Bale, who, it was not to be doubted, would enter heartily into the intere&s;t of his ward, for whom he expre&s;&s;ed &s;o tender an affection.</P>
<P>While he waited in anxious expectation of a letter from his &s;i&s;ter, to acquaint him when &s;he was to leave Paris, with her guardian, he was plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed with a billet from Mr. Bale him&s;elf, reque&s;ting him to meet mi&s;s Cour|teney and him at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Willis, where they were ju&s;t arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="301">Mr. Courteney, without communicating this news to lady Meadows, ha&s;tened to &s;ee his be|loved &s;i&s;ter. The moment he entered the room, where &s;he was &s;itting with her guardian and Mrs. Willis, &s;he flew to receive him with a tran&s;port of joy. He embraced her tenderly; and Mr. Bale advancing to &s;alute him, he in the polite&s;t manner, thanked him for his generous care of Henrietta.</P>
<P>Mr. Bale was extremely plea&s;ed to hear that &s;he might depend upon an affectionate recep|tion from her aunt. "And now, my child," &s;aid he; for &s;o he tenderly affected to call her,
<Q>&s;ince I have delivered you &s;afe into the hand&punc; of your brother, I will leave you, and a day or two hence I will vi&s;it you at your aunt's, and &s;ettle your affairs in a manner which I hope will not be di&s;agreeable to you.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, who, from &s;ome pa&s;t conver&s;a|tions with him, well knew the kind purport of the&s;e words, by a grateful look and a re&s;pectful courte&s;y, expre&s;&s;ed her acknowledgment. Mr. Courteney, &s;eeing him prepare to leave them, begged he would favour him with a few mo|ments private conver&s;ation. Mr. Bale readily con&s;ented; upon which Mrs. Willis &s;hewed them into another room, and returned to load
<PB N="295" REF="302">
her dear mi&s;s Courteney with a thou&s;and tender care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Mean time Mr. Courteney gave the friendly guardian of his &s;i&s;ter a brief account of the mar|quis's pa&s;&s;ion for her, and the conduct he had ob&s;erved in that affair. He added, that he be|lieved it would be ea&s;y to engage the duke's con&s;ent to his &s;on's marriage with Henrietta, provided her aunt would act as generou&s;ly to|wards her, as &s;he had formerly given her rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P><Q>From &s;everal hints (&s;aid he) which lady Meadows has thrown out, and from the great kindne&s;s &s;he expre&s;&s;es for me, I am ap|prehen&s;ive that &s;he intends to transfer her bounty from my &s;i&s;ter to me; but as my cir|cum&s;tances, though not affluent, are ea&s;y, and as I have nothing &s;o much at heart as the happine&s;s of my friend and my &s;i&s;ter, I will mo&s;t: chearfully relinqui&s;h in her favour all my expectations from lady Meadows. The pro&s;|pect of &s;o advantageous a match will pro|bably have &s;ome weight with her aunt; and the mention of it will come with propriety from you, &s;ir, as the guardian of Henrietta. Lady Meadows will then explain her&s;elf clearly; and we &s;hall have an opportunity given us of pre&s;&s;ing her to remove, by her
<PB N="296" REF="303">
genero&s;ity, the only ob&s;tacle that ob&s;tructs my &s;i&s;ter's advancement.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Bale was prodigiou&s;ly affected with the uncommon noblene&s;s of this proceeding. He took the young gentleman's hand, and, giving it an affectionate &s;hake,
<Q>I &s;hall love and ho|nour you while I live (&s;aid he) for this ge|nerous propo&s;al: doubt not of my ready con|currence in every mea&s;ure for your &s;i&s;ter's ad|vantage. I love her as well as if &s;he was my own daughter; and the inconveniences &s;he has &s;uffered through the folly and imprudence of &s;ome of my family, require that I &s;hould make her amends, by doing every thing in my power to make her happy.</Q></P>
<P>"I will wait upon lady MeadoWs," pur&s;ued he,
<Q>to-morrow in the afternoon, and then we will talk over this affair.</Q>
Mr. Courte|ney told him, he would prepare his aunt for the vi&s;it he intended her. After which, Mr, Bale went away, and he joined his &s;i&s;ter and her friend. A coach being ordered, they took leave of Mrs. Willis, whom Henrietta promi&s;ed to vi&s;it again very &s;peedily. Mr. Courteney had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with his &s;i&s;ter as they went, con|cerning the marquis; but carefully avoided mentioning his de&s;ign to her, le&s;t he &s;hould
<PB N="297" REF="304">
rai&s;e hopes which might be unhappily di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>Henrietta was under &s;ome perturbation at the thoughts of appearing before her aunt, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure, again&s;t her, and unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, all recurred to her memory; but the reception the old lady gave her, immediately effaced tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions: it was perfectly kind and affec|tionate, without the lea&s;t mixture of upbraiding or reproach.</P>
<P>"I had a mind to &s;urpri&s;e you, madam," &s;aid Mr. Courteney, who with infinite plea&s;ure beheld his &s;i&s;ter &s;o tenderly embraced by her aunt. Lady Meadows a&s;&s;ured him, that he had &s;urpri&s;ed her very agreeably; and, again embracing Henrietta, told her, that her good friend, the counte&s;s of &mdash;, had been very lavi&s;h in her prai&s;e, and had acquainted her with &s;everal circum&s;tances of her conduct, which had rai&s;ed her highly in her opi|nion.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you will not be very much grieved (added the old lady, &s;miling) to hear that your former lover lord B&mdash; is married to the citizen's daughter.</Q></P>
<P>"No, indeed, madam," replied Henrietta, "they &s;eemed to be formed for each other."</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="305">"They are not very happy, I hear," &s;aid lady Meadows; who, having fallen upon the article of dome&s;tic news, related a great number of anecdotes concerning her acquaintance, &s;ome of which Henrietta had often,heard before. The old lady's fondne&s;s for talking at length gave way to her curio&s;ity to hear every thing that had happened to her niece during their &s;epa|ration.</P>
<P>Henrietta gratified it with di&s;cretion, &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing whatever might tend to revive di&s;agreeable remembrances. She was now put into po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of her former apartment, and had an op|portunity that night to congratulate her old friend Mrs. White (who a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to undre&s;s) upon her being rein&s;tated in the favour of her lady.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which concludes the hi&s;tory.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next day Mr. Courteney informed lady Meadows, that Mr. Bale intended to wait on her, and hinted that he had a match to propo&s;e for Henrietta, which he hoped &s;he would approve.</P>
<P>Lady Meadows, who had already taken her re&s;olution with regard to both brother and &s;i&s;ter, told him, that &s;he was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing her niece &s;ettled; and that &s;he was determined never to oppo&s;e her inclinations, being con|vinced that her virtue and prudence were to be entirely depended upon.</P>
<P>Mr. Bale came according to his appointment; and, being &s;oon after left alone with lady Mea|dows, he acquainted her with the whole affair between the marquis of &mdash; and Henrietta, as he had received it from Mr. Courteney; and, ob&s;erving that the old lady was dazzled with the pro&s;pect of her niece becoming a dutche&s;s, added, that the want of a &s;uitable fortune &s;hould not
<PB N="300" REF="307">
hinder the advancement of Henrietta:
<Q>for whatever you de&s;ign for her, madam (&s;aid he) I will double; &s;o great is my regard for her, and admiration of her virtues.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Meadows with rea&s;on thought this a very generous propo&s;al. She complimented him upon it; and, &s;tepping to her cabinet, took out a box that contained her will, and another deed which had been drawn up, while Mr. Courte|ney was in the country with the duke of &mdash;, but were not yet executed. She put the&s;e papers into Mr. Bale's hands, and de&s;ired him to read them, &s;aying,
<Q>you will there &s;ee, &s;ir, what I intend to do for my nephew and his &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Bale opened the fir&s;t, which was the will. He found &s;he had con&s;tituted Mr. Cour|teney her heir, leaving him her whole e&s;tate, charging it only with the &s;um of five thou&s;and pounds, to be paid his &s;i&s;ter on the day of her marriage. The other paper contained a &s;ettle|ment of three hundred pounds a year upon Mr. Courteney during her life.</P>
<P>Mr. Bale, who knew the young gentleman's &s;entiments, propo&s;ed to lady Meadows to &s;end for him, and acquaint him with her intentions. To this &s;he readily agreed. Mr. Courteney
<PB N="301" REF="308">
turned pale when he heard the moderate &s;um de&s;igned for his &s;i&s;ter; and, after expre&s;&s;ing his gratitude to lady Meadows for the favour &s;he &s;hewed him, in terms the mo&s;t re&s;pectful and affectionate, he earne&s;tly conjured her to let Henrietta be at lea&s;t an equal &s;harer with him in her kindne&s;s. He urged, as a motive to her to comply, the very advantageous match that was propo&s;ed to his &s;i&s;ter. He expatiated on the marquis's tender and faithful pa&s;&s;ion for her; and touched with great delicacy upon the &s;en|timents Henrietta could not avoid entertaining for a young nobleman, who had loved her with honour, even when ignorant of her birth, and when &s;he was under very humiliating circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>Lady Meadows interrupted him with the mo&s;t flattering prai&s;es of his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s; but declared that her re&s;olution was unalterable. "Your &s;i&s;ter will have ten thou&s;and pounds," &s;aid &s;he;
<Q>this is no de&s;picable fortune: and &s;ince there is &s;o much love on the &s;ide of the marquis, there is no doubt but it will be thought &s;ufficient.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Bale explained the old lady's meaning, by telling him what he propo&s;ed to do for mi&s;s Courteney, and preventing the young gentle|man's
<PB N="302" REF="309">
acknowledgments:
<Q>You have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn your regard for your &s;i&s;ter (&s;aid he) and I am of opinion we ought not to pre&s;s lady Meadows any more on this &s;ubject; &s;he has acted nobly by you both.</Q></P>
<P>The lady was extremely flattered by the prai&s;e Mr. Bale gave her; and, to prevent any more &s;olicitations from her nephew, &s;he &s;igned the papers immediately, which Mr. Bale, at her reque&s;t, witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney &s;aid every thing that grati|tude and politene&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t, upon her pre|&s;enting him the &s;ettlement; yet there was an air of concern upon his countenance, which Mr. Bale ob&s;erving, took an opportunity to de&s;ire him, in a whi&s;per, to meet him at a coffee-hou&s;e (which he named to him) that evening, having &s;omething to &s;ay to him, which he hoped would make all things ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney promi&s;ed to attend him. He then begged lady Meadows not to let Henrietta know what had pa&s;&s;ed with regard to the mar|quis.
<Q>At pre&s;ent (&s;aid he) &s;he con&s;iders this marriage as impo&s;&s;ible to be effected, and &s;o I would have her con&s;ider it, till I am &s;ure that the duke will make no objection to the fortune that is de&s;igned her.</Q>
Lady
<PB N="303" REF="310">
Meadows approved of his caution; and Mr. Bale was de&s;ired to vi&s;it her in her own apart|ment, and acquaint her with the di&s;po&s;itions made by her aunt.</P>
<P>Henrietta expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction at what had been done for her beloved brother, and, with the greate&s;t &s;weetne&s;s, acknowledged her obligations to her aunt for the provi&s;ion &s;he had made for her: but when Mr. Bale acquainted her with the addition he de&s;igned to make to the fortune her aunt would give her, tears of ten|derne&s;s and gratitude over&s;pread her face, and &s;he could utter no more, than,
<Q>O! &s;ir, how generous&mdash; how kind is this&mdash; how &s;hall I re|pay &s;uch unexampled goodne&s;s&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Bale interrupted her &s;oft exclamations, to lead her down &s;tairs to her aunt, to whom &s;he paid her acknowledgments with inimitable grace, and congratulated her brother with &s;o &s;incere a joy, that he, who knew how much &s;he was likely to lo&s;e by his good fortune, was moved al|mo&s;t to tears.</P>
<P>Mr. Bale a &s;hort time afterwards took his leave, and went to the coffee-hou&s;e, where he had appointed Mr. Courteney to meet him. He was &s;oon followed by the young gentleman,
<PB N="304" REF="311">
who&s;e mind was under great agitations on his &s;i&s;ter's account.</P>
<P>"One would hardly imagine," &s;aid Mr. Bale to him, &s;miling,
<Q>that you have ju&s;t been de|clared heir to a good e&s;tate, you look like one di&s;appointed and unhappy.</Q></P>
<P>"I am indeed di&s;appointed, &s;ir," replied Mr. Courteney;
<Q>I had laid a plan to make my &s;i&s;ter and my friend happy: but my aunt's partiality has broke all my mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>"Then you intend," &s;aid Mr. Bale, who had taken particular notice of his la&s;t words,
<Q>to make &s;ome addition to your &s;i&s;ter's fortune, when the e&s;tate comes into your hands?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Certainly, &s;ir (replied Mr. Courteney) I &s;hould but ill de&s;erve it, if I did not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed (re&s;umed Mr. Bale) that you are a very good brother.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All that I can do for my &s;i&s;ter, &s;ir (&s;aid he) will be but bare ju&s;tice; but your genero&s;ity t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her can never be enough admired.</Q></P>
<P>"No more of that," interrupted Mr. Bale.
<Q>I love your &s;i&s;ter: &s;he is a worthy young wo|man; I am grieved to think &s;o noble a match for her, &s;hould meet with any ob&s;truction for
<PB N="305" REF="312">
the want of a fortune. What do you think the duke will expect?</Q></P>
<P>"The lady he has propo&s;ed to his &s;on, &s;ir," &s;aid Mr. Courteney,
<Q>has twenty thou&s;and pounds; and it would have been my pride and happine&s;s to have prevailed with my aunt to make my &s;i&s;ter's fortune equal to that.</Q></P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible!" cried Mr. Bale, &s;urpri&s;ed.
<Q>Why fifteen thou&s;and pounds is at lea&s;t one third of your aunt's fortune?</Q></P>
<P>"My &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Mr. Courteney,
<Q>has a right to expect it. The whole would have been her's but for &s;ome unlucky acci|dents, and the &s;trange partiality of lady Mea|dows for me. All that I can now do is, to let the marquis know, that my &s;i&s;ter will have ten thou&s;and pounds paid on the day of her marriage, and ten thou&s;and more on the death of her aunt. The duke loves money; and I greatly doubt whether all his &s;on's &s;oli|citations will make him reli&s;h this rever&s;ionary ten thou&s;and pounds.</Q></P>
<P>"We will not put it to the hazard," inter|rupted Mr. Bale,
<Q>&s;ince you are determined to act thus generou&s;ly by your &s;i&s;ter, I will lay down the money my&s;elf, and all the &s;ecurity
<PB N="306" REF="313">
I require, is your bond for the re-payment of it, when your aunt's e&s;tate comes into your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Courteney was &s;o overwhelmed with &s;ur|pri&s;e, joy, and gratitude, for this unexpected, noble offer, that, during &s;ome moments, he was unable to utter a word. But this &s;ilence, accompanied with looks the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive that can be imagined, was more eloquent than any language could be. Recovering him&s;elf at la&s;t, he was beginning to pay the warme&s;t acknow|ledgments; but Mr. Bale would not &s;uffer him to proceed.</P>
<P><Q>I am impatient (&s;aid he) for the conclu&s;ion of this affair. Write to your friend imme|diately, and let him know that your &s;i&s;ter's guardian will treat with the duke his father, whenever he plea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Courteney, at his reiterated reque&s;t, took leave of him, and went home, in order to com|municate this joyful news to his friend. Hear|ing that lady Meadows and his &s;i&s;ter were en|gaged in company, he went to his own apart|ment, and wrote a &s;hort letter to the marquis, in which he acquainted him, that his &s;i&s;ter being re&s;tored to the favour of her aunt, he had it now in his power to a&s;&s;ure him, that if he con|tinued

in the &s;ame &s;entiments towards her, and could prevail with his grace to authori&s;e them by his con&s;ent, he was impowered by her aunt and her guardian, to declare that her fortune would be twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Having &s;ealed and di&s;patched this letter to the po&s;t, he joined the company below &s;tairs, with looks &s;o full of &s;atisfaction, and a behaviour animated with &s;uch extraordinary gaiety, that lady Meadows was more than ever delighted with him, concluding that the noble provi&s;ion &s;he had made for him, was the &s;ource of his joy; but Henrietta, who knew her brother better, and who be&s;ides &s;aw &s;omething particular in tho&s;e looks, which he from time to time gave her, felt &s;trange flutterings in her gentle bo&s;om: hopes checked as &s;oon as formed; wi&s;hes &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed as they ro&s;e. In the&s;e perturbations, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed that night and the three following days.</P>
<P>Mean time the marquis, having received Mr. Courteney's letter, was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;udden change in the fortune of Henrietta, that he read it over &s;everal times before he could per|&s;uade him&s;elf what he &s;aw was real. His fir&s;t emotions were all tran&s;port: every ob&s;tacle to his marriage was now removed; and he might
<PB N="308" REF="315">
&s;olicit his father's con&s;ent, with a certainty al|mo&s;t of not being denied. Yet a &s;entiment of delicacy and tenderne&s;s made him regret, that it was not in his power to convince Henrietta of the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his love, and for &s;ome moments rendered him in&s;en&s;ible of his pre&s;ent happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The duke came into his chamber, while he was reading the letter the twentieth time, and &s;o intently, that he did not perceive his en|trance. When &s;uddenly rai&s;ing his eyes, and &s;eeing his father, who, &s;u&s;pecting that this letter, which he &s;eemed to read with &s;o much emotion, came from his mi&s;tre&s;s, was looking earne&s;tly on him.</P>
<P><Q>O! my lord (cried he) there is nothing wanting to make me perfectly happy, but your con&s;ent to my marriage with mi&s;s Courteney. See, my lord, what her brother writes: her brother, who till now has &s;o ob&s;tinately op|po&s;ed my pa&s;&s;ion!</Q></P>
<P>The duke took the letter out of his hands, and having read it, returned it to him again without &s;peaking a word, and walked to the other end of the room. The marquis, who &s;aw nothing unfavourable in his looks, followed him, and, throwing him&s;elf at his feet, conjured him
<PB N="309" REF="316">
not to oppo&s;e his happine&s;s any longer. The duke de&s;ired time to con&s;ider; but his &s;on would not give over his &s;olicitations, till he had ob|tained leave of him to vi&s;it mi&s;s Courteney, and to declare that his addre&s;&s;es had the &s;anction of his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The happy marquis gave orders in&s;tantly for his po&s;t-chai&s;e to be got ready, which his fa|ther at fir&s;t did not oppo&s;e; but, after reflecting a little,</P>
<P><Q>Can you not rein in your impatience for a few days?</Q>
&s;aid he to him;
<Q>I intend to be in town next week: I &s;hall then have an opportunity of &s;eeing the young lady (and, &s;ince you are &s;o ob&s;tinately bent upon the match) of talking to her aunt and her guar|dian.</Q></P>
<P>The marquis would not di&s;oblige his father, by making any objections to this little delay, grievous as it was to him; but retired to write to Mr. Courteney, whom he acquainted with the duke's intentions, and, anticipating the tender name of brother, poured out his whole heart in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of love, friend|&s;hip, joy, and every &s;oft emotion with which he was agitated.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="317">Mr. Courteney having communicated this letter to Mr. Bale, he agreed that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make lady Meadows acquainted with the &s;teps they had taken in the affair. She en|tered with a good grace into the generous de&s;igns of her nephew in favour of his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"If I had done more for her," &s;aid &s;he to him, &s;miling,
<Q>you would not have had an opportunity of doing &s;o much.</Q>
Mr. Cour|teney ki&s;&s;ed her hand with a tender and re&s;pect|ful air.</P>
<P>"Go," &s;aid &s;he, with a look that &s;hewed &s;he was highly plea&s;ed;
<Q>go, and tell your &s;i&s;ter this good news; and tell her al&s;o that I am impatient to embrace and congratulate her.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Courteney willingly obeyed her. He went to Henrietta's apartment, and, &s;eeing her &s;itting pen&s;ive and melancholy, he began to rally her upon her tenderne&s;s for the marquis. She bore it with great &s;weetne&s;s, but not with|out &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; for her brother was u&s;ed to be very delicate and re&s;erved upon that &s;ubject. By degrees he a&s;&s;umed a more &s;erious tone; and at length gave her to under&s;tand, that the mar|quis was now permitted by his father to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="318">Henrietta blu&s;hed and trembled from the mo|ment her brother began to &s;peak to her in a &s;erious manner. Her emotions increa&s;ed as he proceeded; yet &s;he laboured to conceal them, till Mr. Courteney, explaining to her what Mr. Bale had done for her, which nece&s;&s;arily in|cluded his own generous gift, that innate deli|cacy, which had forced her joy to be &s;ilent, &s;uf|fered her gratitude to &s;hew it&s;elf in the mo&s;t lively expre&s;&s;ions. Lady Meadows came into the room, and gave a &s;ea&s;onable interruption to the&s;e tender effu&s;ions of her heart, which Mr. Courteney had li&s;tened to with a kind of painful plea&s;ure. She embraced her niece, and con|gratulated her on her happy fortune.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney, who had now rea&s;on to ex|pect a vi&s;it from the marquis, was not much &s;ur|pri&s;ed a few days afterwards to &s;ee his equipage at the door. After a few moments conver&s;ation with Mr. Courteney, he was introduced to lady Meadows, who received him with great re&s;pect. Henrietta blu&s;hed a little when he appeared, but recovered her&s;elf, and received the tender and re&s;pectful compliment he made her with her u&s;ual grace.</P>
<P>A great deal of company coming in &s;oon af|terwards, he found means to engage her apart for a quarter of an hour. Their conver&s;ation
<PB N="312" REF="319">
was &s;uch as might be expected between per&s;ons of their &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s, who loved each other with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, and now for the fir&s;t time &s;aw them&s;elves at liberty to declare their &s;entiments. Henrietta did not &s;cruple to own to the man, who had &s;o nobly merited her e&s;teem, that her heart had received a mo&s;t tender impre&s;&s;ion for him; and this &s;oft acknow|ledgment completed her lover's felicity.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney waited upon the duke the next morning, and had the plea&s;ure to hear from his own mouth, that he was entirely &s;atisfied with his &s;on's proceedings. His grace vi&s;ited lady Meadows the &s;ame day; and was &s;o charmed with Henrietta, that he &s;carce di&s;co|vered le&s;s impatience than his &s;on, for the con|clu&s;ion of the marriage. Every thing being agreed on between the duke and Mr. Bale, with regard to &s;ettlements, the writings were drawn up with all convenient &s;peed, and a day ap|pointed for the marriage.</P>
<P>Lady Meadows, though a Roman catholic, allowed the ceremony to be performed at her hou&s;e: after which, the new-married pair, with the old lady, the duke, Mr. Bale, and Mr. Courteney, &s;et out for his grace's country &s;eat.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="320">The charming marchione&s;s did not make her fir&s;t public appearance in town till late in the en&s;uing winter; when her beauty, her &s;uf|ferings, her virtue, and her good fortune, were for a long time the &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mr. Courteney, happy in the con&s;cious in|tegrity of his heart, happy in the ardent affec|tion of his &s;i&s;ter and the marquis, and the e&s;teem of all who knew him, was, by the death of lady Meadows, which happened a few months after his &s;i&s;ter's marriage, enabled to di&s;charge his obligations to Mr. Bale. His genero&s;ity was not long unrewarded: an opu|lent heire&s;s fell de&s;perately in love with him; &s;he was related to the duke, who intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o warmly in the affair, that the mar|riage was &s;oon concluded.</P>
<P>Lord B&mdash;, as has been ob&s;erved already, lived very unhappy with his plebeian lady. The &s;ight of the charming Henrietta renewed his pa&s;&s;ion. Tortured with remor&s;e, di&s;appoint|ment, and de&s;pair, he had recour&s;e to the bottle, and fell an early &s;acrifice to intempe|rance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodby, who had always a violent pa&s;&s;ion for a red-coat, li&s;tened to the &s;ighs
<PB N="314" REF="321">
of a young cadet, and married him in a week after their fir&s;t acquaintance. Her excu&s;e for this precipitancy was, that the <HI>lovely youth</HI> would certainly have &s;tabbed him&s;elf, if &s;he had delayed his happine&s;s any longer. With part of her fortune he bought a commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;pent the re&s;t in a few months. After which, he went abroad with his regiment, leaving her, in an ob&s;cure retirement, to be|wail his ab&s;ence, and &s;ooth her love-&s;ick heart, with hopes that he would return more <HI>pa&s;|&s;ionate</HI> than ever, and lay all his laurels at her feet.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Belmour, for&s;aken by her lover, became a pro&s;elyte to the Roman catholic religion, and retired to a convent, where the nuns wrought her up to &s;uch a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that &s;he &s;ettled her whole fortune upon the community, and took the veil; but &s;oon afterwards, repent|ing of this ra&s;h &s;tep, &s;he died of grief, remor&s;e, and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis was generou&s;ly rewarded by the marchione&s;s, for the many kind and faithful &s;er|vices &s;he had received from her: and Mr. Bale, who highly e&s;teemed her for her behaviour to his beauteous ward, &s;ettled her hu&s;band in &s;uch an advantageous way, that in a few years he made a con&s;iderable fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="322">The younger Mr. Bale found, in the ince&s;|&s;ant clamours of a jealous wife, a &s;ufficient pu|ni&s;hment for his treacherous de&s;igns on Hen|rietta; and it was not without great difficulty, that he was re&s;tored to his father's favour.</P>
<P>Every branch of the Courteney family made frequent advances towards a reconciliation with the marchione&s;s and her brother: but ge|nerous as they were, they had too ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the indignities they had &s;uffered from them, to admit of it; and, in this &s;teady re&s;entment, they had, as it u&s;ually happens with &s;ucce&s;sful per&s;ons, the world on their &s;ide.</P>
