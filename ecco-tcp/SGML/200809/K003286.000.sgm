<L>WE all are a wonderful Di&s;tance from Home!</L>
<L>Two Hundred and Sixty long Miles are we come!</L>
<L>And &s;ure you'll rejoice, my dear Mother, to hear</L>
<L>We are &s;afely arriv'd at the Sign of the Bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis a plaguy long Way!&mdash;but I ne'er can repine,</L>
<L>As my Stomach is weak, and my Spirits decline:</L>
<L>For the People &s;ay here,&mdash;be whatever your Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>You are &s;ure to get well, if you come to this Place.&mdash;</L>
<L>Mi&s;s JENNY made Fun, as &s;he always is wont,</L>
<L>Of PRUDENCE my Si&s;ter, and TABITHA RUNT,</L>
<L>And every Moment &s;he heard me complain,</L>
<L>Declar'd I was vapour'd, and laugh'd at my Pain.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12">What, tho' at <HI>Devizes</HI> I fed pretty hearty,</L>
<L>And made a good Meal, like the re&s;t of the Party,</L>
<L>When I came here to <HI>Bath,</HI> not a Bit could I eat,</L>
<L>Though the Man at the Bear had provided a Treat,</L>
<L>And &s;o I went quite out of Spirits to Bed,</L>
<L>With Wind in my Stomach, and Noi&s;e in my Head.</L>
<L>As we all came for Health, (as a Body may &s;ay)</L>
<L>I &s;ent for the Doctor the very next Day,</L>
<L>And the Doctor was pleas'd, tho' &s;o &s;hort was the Warning,</L>
<L>To come to our Lodgings betimes in the Morning&punc;</L>
<L>He look'd very thoughtful and grave, to be &s;ure,</L>
<L>And I &s;aid to my&s;elf,&mdash;There's no Hopes of a Cure!</L>
<L>But I thought I &s;hould faint when I &s;aw him, dear Mother,</L>
<L>Feel my Pul&s;e with one Hand, with a Watch in the other,</L>
<L>No Token of Death that is heard in the Night</L>
<L>Could ever have put me &s;o much in a Fright,</L>
<L>Thinks I&mdash;'tis all over&mdash;my Sentence is pa&s;t!</L>
<L>And now He is counting how long I may la&s;t.&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13">Then He look'd at&mdash;and His Face grew &s;o long,</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure He thought &s;omething within me was wrong.&mdash;</L>
<L>He determin'd our Ca&s;es at length (G-d pre&s;erve us)</L>
<L>I'm Bilious, I find, and the Women are Nervous;</L>
<L>Their Sy&s;tems relax'd, and all turn'd top&s;y-turvy,</L>
<L>With Hypochondriacs, Ob&s;tructions, and Scurvy:</L>
<L>And the&s;e are Di&s;tempers He mu&s;t know the whole on,</L>
<L>For He talk'd of the Peritoneum and Colon,</L>
<L>Of Phleghmatic Humours oppre&s;&s;ing the Women</L>
<L>From &s;oeculent Matter that &s;wells the Abdomen;</L>
<L>But the Noi&s;e I have heard in my Bowels like Thunder</L>
<L>Is a Flatus, I find, in my left Hypochonder.</L>

<L><HI>Ad Crepitus Ve&s;per: &amp; Man: promovend'</HI></L>
<L>In Engli&s;h to &s;ay, we mu&s;t &s;wallow a Potion</L>
<L>For driving out Wind after every Motion;</L>

<L>Or a ravenous Pica, &s;o brought on the Vapours</L>
<L>By &s;wallowing Stuff &s;he has read in the Papers,</L>
<L>And often I've marvel'd &s;he &s;pent &s;o much Money</L>
<L>In Water-Dock E&s;&s;ence, and Bal&s;am of Honey;</L>
<L>Such Tinctures, Elixirs, &s;uch Pills have I &s;een,</L>
<L>I never could wonder her Face was &s;o green.</L>
<L>Yet He thinks He can very &s;oon &s;et Her to right</L>
<L>With <HI>Te&s;tic: Equin:</HI> that &s;he takes ev'ry Night;</L>
<L>And when to her Spirits and Strength He has brought her,</L>
<L>He thinks &s;he may venture to bathe in the <HI>Water.</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>But PRUDENCE is forc'd ev'ry Day to ride out,</L>
<L>For he &s;ays &s;he wants thoroughly jumbling about.</L>
<L>Now it happens in this very Hou&s;e is a Lodger,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Name's NICODEMUS, but &s;ome call him ROGER:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15">And ROGER's &s;o good as my Si&s;ter to bump</L>
<L>On a Pillion, as &s;oon as &s;he comes from the Pump;</L>
<L>He's a pious good Man, and an excellent Scholar,</L>
<L>And I think it is certain no Harm can befall Her,</L>
<L>For ROGER is con&s;tantly &s;aying his Pray'rs,</L>
<L>And &s;inging of &s;piritual Hymns on the Stairs.</L>
<L>But my Cou&s;in Mi&s;s JENNY's as fre&s;h as a Ro&s;e,</L>
<L>And the Captain attends Her wherever &s;he goes:</L>
<L>The Captain's a <HI>worthy good Sort of a Man,</HI></L>
<L>For He calls in upon us whenever He can,</L>
<L>And often a Dinner or Supper He takes here,</L>
<L>And JENNY and He talk of MILTON and SHAKESPEAR,</L>
<L>For the Life of me now I can't think of his Name,</L>
<L>But we all got acquainted as &s;oon as we came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Don't wonder, dear Mother, in Ver&s;e I have writ,</L>
<L>For JENNY declares I've a good pretty Wit;</L>
<L>She &s;ays that &s;he frequently &s;ends a few Ver&s;es</L>

<LG>
<L>DEAR Mother, my Time has been wretchedly &s;pent</L>
<L>With a Gripe or a Hickup wherever I went,</L>
<L>My Stomach all &s;well'd, till I thought it would bur&s;t,</L>
<L>Sure never poor Mortal with Wind was &s;o cur&s;t!</L>
<L>If ever I ate a good Supper at Night,</L>
<L>I dream'd of the Devil, and wak'd in a Fright:</L>
<L>And &s;o as I grew ev'ry Day wor&s;e and wor&s;e,</L>
<L>The Doctor advis'd me to &s;end for a Nur&s;e;</L>
<L>And the Nur&s;e was &s;o willing my Health to re&s;tore,</L>
<L>She beg'd me to &s;end for a few Doctors more;</L>
<L>For when any difficult Work's to be done,</L>
<L>Many Heads can di&s;patch it much &s;ooner than one;</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="25">And I find there are Doctors enough at this Place,</L>
<L>If you want to con&s;ult in a dangerous Ca&s;e.</L>
<L>So they all met together, and thus began talking:</L>
<L>"Good Doctor, I'm your's&mdash;'tis a fine Day for walking&mdash;</L>
<L>"Sad News in the Papers&mdash;G-d knows who's to blame&mdash;</L>
<L>"The Colonies &s;eem to be all in a Flame&mdash;</L>
<L>"This Stamp-Act, no doubt, might be good for the Crown&mdash;</L>
<L>"But I &s;ear 'tis a Pill that will never go down&mdash;</L>
<L>"What can <HI>Portugal</HI> mean?&mdash;is <HI>She</HI> going to &s;tir up</L>
<L>"Convul&s;ions and Heats in the Bowels of <HI>Europe?</HI></L>
<L>"'Twill be fatal if <HI>England</HI> relap&s;es again</L>
<L>"From the ill Blood and Humours of <HI>Bourbon</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI>"&mdash;</L>
<L>Says I, my good Doctors, I can't under&s;tand</L>
<L>Why the Deuce ye take &s;o many Patients in Hand,</L>
<L>Ye've a great deal of Practice, as far as I find;</L>
<L>But &s;ince ye're come hither, do pray be &s;o kind</L>
<L>To write me down &s;omething that's good for the Wind.</L>
<L>No Doubt ye are all of ye great Politicians,</L>
<L>But at pre&s;ent <HI>my Bowels</HI> have need of Phy&s;icians:</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="26">Con&s;ider my Ca&s;e in the Light it de&s;erves,</L>
<L>And pity the State of my Stomach and Nerves.&mdash;</L>
<L>But a tight little Doctor began a Di&s;pute</L>
<L>About Admini&s;trations, NEW&mdash;LE and B&mdash;E,</L>
<L>Talk'd much of Oeconomy, much of Pro&s;u&s;ene&s;s.&mdash;</L>
<L>Says another&mdash; "This Ca&s;e, which at fir&s;t was a Loo&s;ene&s;s,</L>
<L>"Is become a Tene&s;mus, and all we can do</L>
<L>"Is to give him a gentle Cathartic or two;</L>
<L>"Fir&s;t get off the Phlegm that adheres to the <HI>Plicae,</HI></L>
<L>"Then throw in a Med'cine that's pretty and &s;picy,&mdash;</L>
<L>"A Peppermint Draught,&mdash;or a&mdash;Come, let's be gone,</L>
<L>"We've another bad Ca&s;e to con&s;ider at One."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So thus they bru&s;h'd off, each his Cane at his No&s;e,</L>
<L>When JENNY came in, who had heard all their Pro&s;e:</L>
<L>I'll teach them, &s;ays &s;he, at their next Con&s;ultation,</L>
<L>To come and take Fees for the Good of the Nation.</L>
<L>I could not conceive what the Devil &s;he mean't,</L>
<L>But &s;he &s;eiz'd all the Stuff that the Doctor had &s;ent,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="27">And out of the Window &s;he flung it down &s;ou&s;e,</L>
<L>As the fir&s;t Politician went out of the Hou&s;e.</L>
<L>Decoctions and Syrups around him all flew,</L>
<L>The Pill, Bolus, Julep, and Apozem too;</L>
<L>His Wig had the Luck a Cathartic to meet,</L>
<L>And &s;qua&s;h went the Gallipot under his Feet.</L>
<L>She &s;aid 'twas a Shame I &s;hould &s;wallow &s;uch Stuff</L>
<L>When my Bowels were weak, and the Phy&s;ic &s;o rough;</L>
<L>Declar'd &s;he was &s;hock'd that &s;o many &s;hould come</L>
<L>To be Doctor'd to Death, &s;uch a Di&s;tance from Home,</L>
<L>At a Place where they tell you that Water alone</L>
<L>Can cure all Di&s;tempers that ever were known.</L>
<L>But what is the plea&s;ante&s;t Part of the Story,</L>
<L>She has order'd for Dinner a Piper and Dory;</L>
<L>For to-Day Captain CORMORANT's coming to dine,</L>
<L>That worthy Acquaintance of JENNY's and mine.</L>
<L>'Tis a Shame to the Army, that Men of &s;uch Spirit</L>
<L>Should never obtain the Reward of their Merit,</L>
<L>For the Captain's as gallant a Man, I'll be &s;worn,</L>
<L>And as hone&s;t a Fellow as ever was born;</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="28">After &s;o many Hard&s;hips and Dangers incurr'd,</L>
<L>He Him&s;elf thinks He ought to be better preferr'd;</L>
<L>And ROGER, or what is his Name, NICODEMUS,</L>
<L>Appears full as kind, and as much to e&s;teem us;</L>
<L>Our PRUDENCE declares he's an excellent Preacher,</L>
<L>And by Night and by Day is &s;o good as to teach her;</L>
<L>His Doctrine &s;o &s;ound with &s;uch Spirit he gives,</L>
<L>She ne'er can forget it as long as &s;he lives.</L>
<L>I told you before that He's often &s;o kind</L>
<L>As to go out a riding with PRUDENCE behind,</L>
<L>So frequently dines here without any pre&s;&s;ing,</L>
<L>And now to the Fi&s;h he is giving his Ble&s;&s;ing;</L>
<L>And as that is the Ca&s;e, tho' I've taken a Griper,</L>
<L>I'll venture to peck at the Dory and Piper.</L>

<LG>
<L>NO City, dear Mother, this City excels</L>
<L>For charming &s;weet Sounds both of Fiddles and Bells;</L>
<L>I thought, like a Fool, that they only would ring</L>
<L>For a Wedding, or Judge, or the Birth of a King;</L>
<L>But I found 'twas for <HI>Me</HI> that the good-natur'd People</L>
<L>Rung &s;o hard that I thought they would pull down the Steeple,</L>
<L>So I took out my Pur&s;e, as I hate to be &s;habby,</L>
<L>And paid all the Men when they came from the Abbey;</L>
<L>Yet &s;ome think it &s;trange they &s;hould make &s;uch a Riot</L>
<L>In a Place where &s;ick Folk would be glad to be quiet,</L>
<L>But I hear 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Corporation</L>
<L>To welcome in all the <HI>Great</HI> Men of the Nation,</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="30">For you know there is nothing diverts or employs</L>
<L>The Minds of <HI>Great</HI> People like making a Noi&s;e:</L>
<L>So with Bells they contrive all as much as they can</L>
<L>To tell the Arrival of any &s;uch Man.</L>
<L>If a Broker, or State&s;man, a Game&s;ter, or Peer,</L>
<L>A nat'raliz'd Jew or a Bi&s;hop comes here;</L>
<L>Or <HI>an eminent Trader in Chee&s;e</HI> &s;hould retire</L>
<L>Ju&s;t to think of the Bus'ne&s;s the State may require,</L>
<L>With Horns and with Trumpets, with Fiddles and Drums,</L>
<L>They'll &s;trive to divert him as &s;oon as he comes.</L>
<L>'Tis amazing they find &s;uch a Number of Ways</L>
<L>Of employing his Thoughts all the Time that he &s;tays;</L>
<L>If by chance the <HI>Great</HI> Man at his Lodging alone is,</L>
<L>He may view from his Window the Colliers Ponies</L>
<L>On both the Parades, where they tumble and kick,</L>
<L>To the great Entertainment of tho&s;e that are &s;ick:</L>
<L>What a Number of Turn&s;pits and Builders he'll find</L>
<L>For relaxing his Cares, and unbending his Mind,</L>
<L>While Notes of &s;weet Mu&s;ic contend with the Cries</L>
<L>Of <HI>fine potted Laver, fre&s;h Oy&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>Pies!</HI></L>

<L>Since the City-Mu&s;icians &s;o tickled my Ear;</L>
<L>For when we arriv'd here at <HI>Bath</HI> t'other Day,</L>
<L>They came to our Lodgings on Purpo&s;e to play:</L>
<L>And I thought it was right, as the Mu&s;ic was come,</L>
<L>To foot it a little in TABITHA's Room,</L>
<L>For Practice makes perfect, as often I've read,</L>
<L>And to Heels is of Service as well as the Head;</L>
<L>But the Lodgers were &s;hock'd &s;uch a Noi&s;e we &s;hould make,</L>
<L>And the Ladies declar'd that we kept them awake;</L>
<L>Lord RINGBONE, who lay in the Parlour below,</L>
<L>On Account of the Gout he had got in his Toe,</L>
<L>Began on a &s;udden to cur&s;e and to &s;wear,</L>
<L>I prote&s;t, my dear Mother, 'twas &s;hocking to hear</L>
<L>The Oaths of that reprobate gouty old Peer:</L>
<L>"All the Devils in Hell &s;ure at once have concurr'd</L>
<L>"To make &s;uch a Noi&s;e here as never was heard,</L>
<L>"Some blundering Blockhead, while I am in Bed,</L>
<L>"Treads as hard as a Coach-Hor&s;e ju&s;t over my Head;</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="32">"I cannot conceive what a Plague he's about,</L>
<L>"Are the Fidlers come hither to make all this Rout</L>
<L>"With their d-mn'd &s;queaking Catgut that's wor&s;e than the Gout?</L>
<L>"If the Aldermen bad 'em come hither, I &s;wear</L>

<L>So while they were playing their mu&s;ical Airs,</L>
<L>And I was ju&s;t dancing the Hay round the Chairs,</L>
<L>He roar'd to his Frenchman to kick them down Stairs.</L>
<L>The Frenchman came forth with his outlandi&s;h Lingo,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t the &s;ame as a Monkey, and made all the Men go:</L>
<L>I could not make out what he &s;aid, not a Word,</L>
<L>And his Lord&s;hip declar'd I was very ab&s;urd.</L>
<L>Says I, "Ma&s;ter RINGBONE, I've nothing to fear,</L>
<L>Tho' you be a Lord, and your Man a Moun&s;eer,</L>
<L>For the May'r and the Aldermen bad them come here:</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="33">'&mdash;As ab&s;urd as I am,</L>

<L>'For a Lord, do you &s;ee,</L>
<L>'Is nothing to me,</L>
<L>'Any more than a Flea;</L>
<L>'And your Frenchman &s;o eager,</L>
<L>'With all his Soup Meagre,</L>

<L>'For the B&mdash;N&mdash;R&mdash;D Family all can afford</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>So I thank'd the Mu&s;icians, and gave them a Guinea,</L>
<L>Tho' the Ladies and Gentlemen call'd me a Ninny;</L>
<L>And I'll give them another the next Time they play,</L>
<L>For Men of good Fortune encourage, they &s;ay,</L>

<L>THIS Morning, dear Mother, as &s;oon as 'twas light,</L>

<L>I could not conceive what the Deuce was the Matter:</L>
<L>And, would you believe it? I went up and found her</L>
<L>In a Blanket, with two lu&s;ty Fellows around her,</L>
<L>Who both &s;eem'd a going to carry her off in</L>
<L>A little black Box ju&s;t the Size of a Coffin:</L>
<L>Pray tell me, &s;ays I, what ye're doing of there?</L>
<L>"Why, Ma&s;ter, 'tis hard to be bilk'd of our Fare,</L>
<L>"And &s;o we were thru&s;ting her into a Chair:</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="36">"We don't &s;ee no Rea&s;on for u&s;ing us &s;o,</L>
<L>"For &s;he bad us come hither, and now &s;he won't go;</L>
<L>"We're earn'd all the Fare, for we both came and knock'd her</L>
<L>"Up, as &s;oon as 'twas light, by Advice of the Doctor;</L>
<L>"And this is a Job that we often go a'ter</L>
<L>"For Ladies that choo&s;e to go into the Water."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'But pray,' &s;ays I, 'TABITHA, what is your Drift</L>
<L>'To be cover'd in Flannel in&s;tead of a Shift?</L>
<L>''Tis all by the Doctor's Advice, I &s;uppo&s;e,</L>
<L>'That Nothing is left to be &s;een but your No&s;e:</L>
<L>'I think if you really intend to go in,</L>

<L>'And if you've a Mind for a Frolick, i'fa'th</L>
<L>'I'll ju&s;t &s;tep and &s;ee you jump into the Bath.'</L>
<L>So they hoi&s;ted her down ju&s;t as &s;afe and as well</L>
<L>And as &s;nug as a Hod'mandod rides in his Shell:</L>
<L>I fain would have gone to &s;ee TABITHA dip,</L>
<L>But they turn'd at a Corner and gave me the Slip,</L>
<L>Yet in &s;earching about I had better Succe&s;s,</L>

<L>And laid my&s;elf down there, as &s;nug and as &s;till</L>
<L>(As a Body may &s;ay) like a Thief in a Mill:</L>
<L>And of all the fine Sights I have &s;een, my dear Mother,</L>

<L>All the while an old Woman was rubbing their Backs!</L>
<L>Oh 'twas pretty to &s;ee them all put on their Flannels,</L>

<L>And tho' all the while it grew hotter and hotter,</L>

<L>'Twas a glorious Sight to behold the Fair Sex</L>
<L>All wading with Gentlemen up to their Necks,</L>
<L>And view them &s;o prettily tumble and &s;prawl</L>
<L>In a great &s;moaking Kettle as big as our Hall:</L>

<L>It pleas'd me to &s;ee how they all were inclin'd</L>

<L><PB N="102" REF="99">A Fidler of Note,</L>
<L>Who, for Lace on his Coat,</L>
<L>To his Taylor was much in Arrears;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An Author of Merit,</L>
<L>Who wrote with &s;uch Spirit,</L>
<L>The Pillory took off his Ears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Sum, my dear Mother, far heavier yet,</L>
<L>Captain CORMORANT won, when I learn'd Lan&s;quenet;</L>
<L>Two Hundred I paid him, and Five am in Debt.</L>
<L>For the Five, I had nothing to do but to <HI>write,</HI></L>
<L>For the Captain was very well bred, and polite,</L>
<L>And took, as he &s;aw my Expences were great,</L>
<L>My Bond, to be paid on the <HI>Clodpole</HI> E&s;tate;</L>
<L>And asks nothing more while the Money is lent,</L>
<L>Than Intere&s;t paid him at Twenty per Cent.</L>
<L>But I'm &s;hock'd to relate what Di&s;tre&s;&s;es befall</L>
<L>Mi&s;s JENNY, my Si&s;ter and TABBY and all:</L>
<L>Mi&s;s JENNY, poor Thing, from this <HI>Bath</HI> Expedition,</L>
<L>Was in Hopes very &s;oon to have chang'd her Condition;</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="100">But Rumour has brought certain Things to her Ear,</L>
<L>Which I ne'er will believe, yet am &s;orry to hear;</L>
<L>"That the Captain, her Lover, her dear ROME&Ocirc;,</L>
<L>Was Bani&s;h'd the Army a great while ago.</L>
<L>That his Friends and his Foes He alike can betray,</L>
<L>And picks up a &s;candalous Living by Play:"</L>
<L>But if e'er I could think that the Captain had cheated,</L>
<L>Or my dear Cou&s;in JENNY unworthily treated,</L>
<L>By all that is &s;acred I &s;wear, for his Pains</L>
<L>I'd cudgel him fir&s;t, and then blow out his Brains.</L>
<L>For the Man I abhor like the Devil, dear Mother,</L>
<L>Who one Thing conceals, and profe&s;&s;es another.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O how &s;hall we know the right Way to pur&s;ue!&mdash;</L>
<L>Do the Ills of Mankind from Religion accrue!&mdash;</L>
<L>Religion, de&s;ign'd to relieve all our Care,</L>
<L>Has brought my poor Si&s;ter to Grief and De&s;pair:</L>
<L>Now &s;he talks of Damnation, and &s;crews up her face;</L>
<L>Then prates about ROGER, and &s;piritual Grace:</L>
<L>Her &s;en&s;es, alas! &s;eem at once gone a&s;tray&mdash;</L>
<L>No Pen can de&s;cribe it, no Letter convey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the <HI>Man without Sin,</HI> that <HI>Moravian</HI> Rabbi,</L>
<L>Has perfectly cur'd the <HI>Chloro&s;is</HI> of TABBY;</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="101">And, if right I can judge, from her Shape and her Face,</L>
<L>She &s;oon may produce him an Infant of Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now they &s;ay that all People, in our Situation,</L>
<L>Are very fine &s;ubjects for Regeneration:</L>
<L>But I think, my dear Mother, the be&s;t we can do,</L>
<L>Is to pack up our All, and return back to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Farewell then, ye Streams,</L>
<L>Ye poetical Themes!</L>
<L>Sweet Fountains for curing the Spleen!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'm griev'd to the Heart,</L>
<L>Without Ca&s;h to depart,</L>
<L>And quit this adorable Scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where Gaming and Grace</L>
<L>Each other embrace,</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;ipation and Piety meet:&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May all, who've a Notion</L>
<L>Of Cards or Devotion,</L>
<L>Make <HI>Bath</HI> their delightful Retreat.</L>
