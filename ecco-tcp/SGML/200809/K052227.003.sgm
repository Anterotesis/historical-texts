<P><HI>AGamemnon</HI> after the la&s;t Day's Defeat, propo&s;es to the <HI>Greeks</HI> to quit the Siege, and return to their Country. <HI>Diomed</HI> oppo&s;es this, and <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> &s;econds him, prai&s;ing his Wi&s;dom and Re&s;olution. He orders the Guard to be &s;trengthen'd, and a Council &s;ummon'd to deliberate what Mea|&s;ures were to be follow'd in this Emergency. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> pur&s;ues this Advice, and <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> farther prevails upon him to &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Achilles,</HI> in order to move him to a Recon|ciliation. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Ajax</HI> are made choice of, who are ac|companied by old <HI>Phoenix.</HI> They make, each of them, very moving and pre&s;&s;ing Speeches, but are rejected with Roughne&s;s by <HI>Achilles,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding retains <HI>Phoenix</HI> in his Tent. The Amba&s;&s;adors return un&s;ucce&s;sfully to the Camp, and the Troops betake them&s;elves to &s;leep.</P>
<P>This Book, and the next following, take up the Space of one <HI>Night,</HI> which is the twenty &s;eventh from the beginning of the Poem. The <HI>Scene</HI> lies on the Sea-&s;hore, the Station of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Ships.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>WE have here a new Scene of Action opened; the Poet has hitherto given us an Account of what happened by Day only: the two following Books relate the Adventures of the Night.</P>
<P>It may be thought that <HI>Homer</HI> has crowded a great many Actions into a very &s;hort Time. In the ninth Book a Coun|cil is conven'd, an Emba&s;&s;y &s;ent, a con&s;iderable Time pa&s;&s;es in the Speeches and Replies of the Emba&s;&s;adors and <HI>Achilles:</HI> In the tenth Book a &s;econd Council is call'd, after this a De|bate is held, <HI>Dolon</HI> is intercepted, <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> enter into the Enemy's Camp, kill <HI>Rhe&s;us,</HI> and bring away his Hor|&s;es: And all this done in the narrow Compa&s;s of one Night.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore be remember'd that the ninth Book takes up the fir&s;t Part of the Night only; that after the fir&s;t Council was di&s;&s;olv'd, there pa&s;s'd &s;ome time before the &s;econd was &s;ummon'd, as appears by the Leaders being awa|kened by <HI>Menelaus.</HI> So that it was almo&s;t Morning before <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;et out upon their De&s;ign, which is very evident from the Words of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> Book. 10. &vers;. 251.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q> <PB N="46" REF="46">So that altho' a great many Incidents are introduc'd, yet eve|ry thing might ea&s;ily have been perform'd in the allotted Time.</P>

<P>I do not pretend to decide upon this Point; but which way &s;oever it be, I think <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s De&s;ign was equally an&s;wer'd by repeating the &s;ame Speech: So that the Repeti|tion at lea&s;t is not to be blamed in <HI>Homer.</HI> What obliged <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to that Feint in the &s;econd Book was the Hatred he had incurred in the Army by being the Cau&s;e of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Departure; this made it but a nece&s;&s;ary Precaution in him to try, before he came to a Battel, whether the <HI>Greeks</HI> were di&s;pos'd to it?

We have here Godde&s;&s;es of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Creation, he &s;ets before us their Pictures in lively Colours, and gives the&s;e fancy'd Beings all the Features that re&s;emble Mankind who offer Injuries, or have Recour&s;e to Prayers.</P>
<P>Prayers are &s;aid to be the Daughters of <HI>Jove,</HI> becau&s;e it is he who teaches Man to pray. They are lame, becau&s;e the Po&s;ture of a Suppliant is with his Knee on the Ground. They are wrinkled, becau&s;e tho&s;e that pray have a Countenance of Dejection and Sorrow. Their Eyes are turn'd a&s;ide, becau&s;e thro' an awful Regard to Heaven they dare not lift them thi|ther. They follow <HI>Ate</HI> or <HI>Injury,</HI> becau&s;e nothing but Prayers can attone for the Wrongs that are offer'd by the injurious. <HI>Ate</HI> is &s;aid to be &s;trong and &s;wift of Foot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e inju|rious Men are &s;wift to do Mi&s;chief. This is the Explanation of <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> with whom <HI>Dacier</HI> agrees, but when &s;he allows the Circum&s;tance of Lamene&s;s to intimate the Cu&s;tom of

<P>A modern Author imagines <HI>Ate</HI> to &s;ignify <HI>divine Ju&s;tice,</HI> a Notion in which he is &s;ingle, and repugnant to all the My|thologi&s;ts. Be&s;ides, the whole Context in this Place, and the very Application of the Allegory to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e of <HI>Achilles,</HI> whom he exhorts to be moved by Prayers notwith|&s;tanding the Inju&s;tice done him by <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> makes the con|trary evident.</P>

<P>I cannot conclude the Notes to this Book without ob&s;er|ving, that what &s;eems the principal Beauty of it, and what di&s;tingui&s;hes it among all the others, is the Liveline&s;s of its Paintings: The Reader &s;ees the mo&s;t natural Night-Scene in the World; he is led &s;tep by &s;tep with the Adventurers, and made the Companion of all their Expectations, and Uncertain|ties. We &s;ee the very Colour of the Sky, know the Time to a Minute, are impatient while the Heroes are arming, our Imagination &s;teals out after them, becomes privy to all their Doubts, and even to the &s;ecret Wi&s;hes of their Hearts &s;ent up to <HI>Minerva.</HI> We are alarmed at the Approach of <HI>Dolon,</HI> hear his very Foot&s;teps, a&s;&s;i&s;t the two Chiefs in pur&s;uing him, and &s;top ju&s;t with the Spear that arre&s;ts him.

The mar&s;hy Spot of Ground where <HI>Dolon</HI> is killed, the Ta|marisk, or aquatic Plants upon which they hang his Spoils, and the Reeds that are heap'd together to mark the Place, are Circum&s;tances the mo&s;t Picture&s;que imaginable.

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Homer</HI>'s Invention is in nothing more wonderful than in the great Variety of Characters with which his Poems are diver&s;ify'd, &s;o his Judgment appears in nothing more exact, than in that Propriety with which each Character is maintain'd. But this Exactne&s;s mu&s;t be collected by a diligent Attention to his Conduct thro' the whole: and when the Particulars of each Character are laid together, we &s;hall find them all proceeding from the &s;ame Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Per&s;on. If this Ob&s;ervation be neglected, the Poet's Conduct will lo&s;e much of its true Beauty and Harmony.</P>
<P>I fancy it will not be unplea&s;ant to the Reader, to con&s;ider the Picture of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> drawn by &s;o ma&s;terly an Hand as that of <HI>Homer</HI> in its full length, after having &s;een him in &s;everal Views and Lights &s;ince the beginning of the Poem.</P>
<P>He is a Ma&s;ter of Policy and Stratagem, and maintains a good Under&s;tanding with his Council; which was but nece&s;&s;ary con&s;idering how many different and independent Nations and Intere&s;ts he had to manage: He &s;eems fully con&s;cious of his own &s;uperior Authority, and always knows the time when to exert it: He is per&s;onally very valiant, but not without &s;ome Mixture of Fiercene&s;s: Highly re&s;entful of the Injuries done

In &s;hort, he is (as <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf in ano|ther Place de&s;cribes him) both a good King, and a great Warrior.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q> It is very ob&s;ervable how this Hero ri&s;es in the Eye and E|&s;teem of the Reader as the Poem advances: It opens with many Circum&s;tances very much to the Di&s;advantage of his Character; he in&s;ults the Prie&s;t of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and outrages <HI>Achilles:</HI> but in the &s;econd Book he grows &s;en&s;ible of the Ef|fects of his Ra&s;hne&s;s, and takes the Fault entirely upon him|&s;elf: In the fourth he &s;hews him&s;elf a skilful Commander, by exhorting, reproving and performing all the Offices of a good General: In the eighth he is deeply touch'd by the Sufferings of his Army, and makes all the Peoples Calamities his own: In the ninth he endeavours to reconcile him&s;elf to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and conde&s;cends to be the Petitioner, becau&s;e it is for the publick Good: In the tenth, finding tho&s;e Endea|vours ineffectual, his Concern keeps him the whole Night awake, in contriving all po&s;&s;ible Methods to a&s;&s;i&s;t them: And now in the eleventh as it were re&s;olving him&s;elf to &s;upply the want of <HI>Achilles,</HI> he grows prodigiou&s;ly in his Valour, and performs Wonders in his &s;ingle Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee <HI>Agamemnon</HI> continually winning upon our E|&s;teem, as we grow acquainted with him; &s;o that he &s;eems to be like that Godde&s;s the Poet de&s;cribes, who was low at the fir&s;t, but ri&s;ing by degrees, at la&s;t reaches the very Heavens.</P>

Papyrius</HI> the Cen&s;or, about the 12<HI>th</HI> Year of the Wars with <HI>Pyrrhus.</HI> But the fir&s;t that was of any U&s;e to the Publick was &s;et up near the <HI>Ro&s;tra</HI> in the <HI>Forum</HI> by <HI>Valerius Me&s;&s;ala</HI> the Con&s;ul, after the taking of <HI>Catana</HI> in <HI>Sicily;</HI> from whence it was brought thirty Years after the fir&s;t had been &s;et up by <HI>Papyrius;</HI> but this was &s;till an imper|fect one, the Lines of it not exactly corre&s;ponding with the &s;everal Hours. Yet they made u&s;e of it many Years, till <HI>Q.

If it had been directly improper in this Ca&s;e, I cannot help fancying that <HI>Homer</HI> would not have fail'd to tell us of <HI>Machaon</HI>'s rejecting it. Yet after all, &s;ome An&s;wer may be made even to the grand Objection, that Wine was too inflammatory for a wounded Man. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> allows Wine in acute Ca&s;es, and even without Water in Ca&s;es of In|dige&s;tion. He &s;ays indeed in his Book of ancient Medicine, that the Ancients were ignorant both of the good and bad Qualities of Wine: and yet the Potion here pre&s;crib'd will not be allow'd by Phy&s;icians to be an In&s;tance that they were &s;o; for Wine might be proper for <HI>Machaon</HI> not only as a Cordial, but as an <HI>Opiate. A&s;clepiades,</HI> a Phy&s;ician who flouri&s;h'd at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Time of <HI>Pompey,</HI> pre&s;cribed Wine in Feavers, and even in Phrenzies to cau&s;e Sleep. <HI>Caelius Au|relianus, lib.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 14.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 801. <HI>Can then the Sons of</HI> Greece, &amp;c.]</Q> It is cu|&s;tomary with tho&s;e who tran&s;late or comment on an Author, to u&s;e him as they do their Mi&s;tre&s;s; they can &s;ee no Faults, or rather convert his very Faults into Beauties; but I cannot be &s;o partial to <HI>Homer,</HI> as to imagine that this Speech of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI>'s is not greatly blameable for being too long: He crouds Incident upon Incident, and when he &s;peaks of him|&s;elf, he expatiates upon his own great Actions, very natu|rally indeed to old Age, but un&s;ea&s;onably in the pre&s;ent Jun|cture. When he comes to &s;peak of his killing the Son of <HI>Augeas,</HI> he is &s;o pleas'd with him&s;elf, that he forgets the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Army, and cannot leave his favourite Subject till he has given us the Pedigree of his Relations, his Wife's Name, her Excellence, the Command he bore, and the Fury with which he a&s;&s;aulted him. The&s;e and many other Circum&s;tances, as they have no vi&s;ible Allu&s;ion to the De&s;ign of the Speech, &s;eem to be unfortunately introduc'd. In &s;hort, I think they are not &s;o valuable upon any other Account, as becau&s;e they pre&s;erve a Piece of ancient Hi&s;tory, which had otherwi&s;e been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>What tends yet farther to make this Story &s;eem ab&s;urd, is what <HI>Patroclus</HI> &s;aid at the beginning of the Speech, that he <HI>had not lei&s;ure even to &s;it down;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> detains him in the Tent &s;tanding, during the whole Narration.</P>
<P>They that are of the contrary Opinion ob&s;erve, that there is a great deal of Art in &s;ome Branches of the Di&s;cour&s;e; that when <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> tells <HI>Patroclus</HI> how he had him&s;elf di&s;obey'd his Father's Commands for the &s;ake of his Country, he &s;ays it to make <HI>Achilles</HI> reflect that he di&s;obeys his Father by the contrary Behaviour: That what he did him&s;elf was to retaliate a &s;mall Injury, but <HI>Achilles</HI> by fighting may &s;ave the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army. He mentions the Wound of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> at the very beginning, with an Intent to give <HI>Achilles</HI> a little Re|venge, and that he may know how much his greate&s;t Enemy has &s;uffer'd by his Ab&s;ence. There are many other Argu|ments brought in the Defence of particular Parts; and it
<PB N="217" REF="214">
may not be from the Purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> might de&s;ignedly protract the Speech, that <HI>Patroclus</HI> might him&s;elf behold the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Army: Thus every Moment he detain'd him, enforced his Arguments, by the growing Mi&s;|fortunes of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Whether this was the Intention or not, it mu&s;t be allowed that the Stay of <HI>Patroclus</HI> was very happy for the <HI>Greeks;</HI> for by this means he met <HI>Eurypylus</HI> wounded, who confirm'd him into a Certainty that their Af|fairs were de&s;perate, without <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Aid.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI>'s &s;econd Story, it is much ea&s;ier to be de|fended; it tends directly to the Matter in hand, and is told in &s;uch a manner as to affect both <HI>Patroclus</HI> and <HI>Achilles;</HI> the Circum&s;tances are well adapted to the Per&s;on to whom they are &s;poken, and by repeating their Father's In&s;tructi|ons, he as it were brings them in, &s;econding his Admo|nitions.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper here to take a general View of the Con|duct of the Iliad: The whole De&s;ign turns upon the Wrath of <HI>Achilles:</HI> that Wrath is not to be appeas'd but by the Calamities of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who are taught by their frequent Defeats the Importance of this Hero: For in Epic, as in Tragic Poetry, there ought to be &s;ome evident and nece&s;&s;ary Incident at the winding up of the Cata&s;trophe, and that &s;hould be founded upon &s;ome vi&s;ible Di&s;tre&s;s. This Conduct has an admirable Effect, not only as it gives an Air of Probability to the Relation, by allowing Lei&s;ure to the Wrath of <HI>Achilles</HI> to cool and die away by degrees, (who is every where de&s;crib'd as a Per&s;on of a &s;tubborn Re&s;entment, and con&s;equently ought not to be ea&s;ily reconcil'd) but al&s;o as it highly contributes to the Honour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which was to be fully &s;atisfy'd, before he could relent.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 15. <HI>Then</HI> Neptune <HI>and</HI> Apollo, &amp;c.]</Q> This whole Epi&s;ode of the De&s;truction of the Wall is &s;poken as a kind of Prophecy, where <HI>Homer</HI> in a poetical Enthu&s;ia&s;m re|lates what was to happen in future Ages. It has been con|jectur'd from hence that our Author flouri&s;h'd not long after the <HI>Trojan</HI> War; for had he lived at a greater Di&s;tance, there had been no occa&s;ion to have Recour&s;e to &s;uch extraor|dinary means to de&s;troy a Wall, which would have been lo&s;t and worn away by Time alone. <HI>Homer</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>) fore|&s;aw the Que&s;tion might be ask'd, how it came to pa&s;s that no Ruins remain'd of &s;o great a Work? and therefore con|trived to give his Fiction the neare&s;t Re&s;emblance to Truth. Inundations and Earthquakes are &s;ufficient to aboli&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t Works of Man, &s;o as not to leave the lea&s;t Re|mains where they &s;tood. But we are told this in a manner wonderfully noble and poetical: We &s;ee <HI>Apollo</HI> turning the Cour&s;e of the Rivers again&s;t the Wall, <HI>Jupiter</HI> opening the Cataracts of Heaven, and <HI>Neptune</HI> rending the Foundations with his Trident: That is, the Sun exhales the Vapours, which de&s;cend in Rain from the Air or <HI>Aether,</HI> this Rain cau&s;es an Inundation, and that Inundation overturns the Wall. Thus the Poetry of <HI>Homer,</HI> like Magick, fir&s;t rai&s;es a &s;tupendous Object, and then immediately cau&s;es it to vani&s;h.</P>
<P>What farther &s;trengthens the Opinion, that <HI>Homer</HI> was particularly careful to avoid the Objection which tho&s;e of his own Age might rai&s;e again&s;t the Probability of this Fiction, is, that the Ver&s;es which contain this Account of the De|&s;truction of the Wall &s;eem to be added and interpolated af|ter the fir&s;t writing of the Iliad, by <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf. I believe the Reader will incline to my Opinion, if he con&s;iders the manner in which they are introduced, both here, and in the &s;eventh Book, where fir&s;t this Wall is mention'd. There, de&s;cribing how it was made, he ends with this Line,<Q><PB N="255" REF="250"><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q> After which is in&s;erted the Debate of the Gods concerning the Method of its De&s;truction, at the Conclu&s;ion whereof immediately follows a Ver&s;e that &s;eems exactly to connect with the former,<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q> In like manner in the pre&s;ent Book, after the fourth Ver&s;e,<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q> That which is now the thirty &s;ixth, &s;eems originally to have follow'd.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q> And all the Lines between (which break the Cour&s;e of the Narration, and are introduced in a manner not u&s;ual in <HI>Ho|mer</HI>) &s;eem to have been added for the Rea&s;on above-&s;aid.

Upon this <HI>Sarpedon</HI> grounds his Di&s;cour&s;e, which is full of Genero&s;ity and No|blene&s;s. We are, &s;ays he, honour'd like Gods; and what can be more unju&s;t, than not to behave our &s;elves like Men? he ought to be &s;uperior in Virtue, who is &s;uperior in Digni|ty; What Strength is there, and what Greatne&s;s in that Thought? it includes Ju&s;tice, Gratitude, and Magnanimity; Ju&s;tice, in that he &s;corns to enjoy what he does not merit; Gratitude, becau&s;e he would endeavour to recompen&s;e his Obligations to his Subjects; and Magnanimity, in that he de&s;pi&s;es Death, and thinks of nothing but Glory. <HI>Eu&s;ta|thius.

not valuing a &s;mall Inequality; nor a Slave, for &s;uch a one is ever regardle&s;s of a Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t: But he &s;peaks of a poor Woman that gains her Livelihood by her Labour, who is at the &s;ame time ju&s;t and hone&s;t; for &s;he will neither defraud others, nor be defrauded her &s;elf.
