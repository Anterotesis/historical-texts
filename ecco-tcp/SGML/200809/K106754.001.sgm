<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;aid, <HI>a book &s;hould be read with the &s;ame &s;pirit with which it has been written.</HI> In that ca&s;e, fatal mu&s;t be the reception of this &mdash; for the writer frankly avows, that during the time &s;he has been writing it, &s;he has &s;uffered every quality and degree of wearine&s;s and la&s;&s;itude, into which no other employment could have betrayed her.</P>
<P>It has been the de&s;tiny of the writer of this Story, to be occupied
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
throughout her life, in what has the lea&s;t &s;uited either her inclination or capacity &mdash; with an invincible im|pediment in her &s;peech, it was her lot for thirteen years to gain a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence by public &s;peaking &mdash; and, with the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation to the fatigue of inventing, a con&s;titution &s;uffering under a &s;edentary life, and an education confined to the narrow boundaries pre&s;cribed her &s;ex, it has been her fate to devote a tedious &s;even years to the unremitting la|bour of literary productions&mdash;whil&s;t a ta&s;te for authors of the fir&s;t rank has been an additional puni&s;hment, forbidding her one moment of tho&s;e &s;elf-approving reflections which are
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
a&s;&s;uredly due to the indu&s;trious.&mdash; But, alas! in the exerci&s;e of the arts, indu&s;try &s;carce bears the name of merit.&mdash;What then is to be &s;ub|&s;tituted in the place of genius? GOOD FORTUNE.&mdash;And if the&s;e volumes &s;hould be attended by the good fortune that has accompanied her other writings, to that divinity, and that alone, &s;he &s;hall attribute their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet, there is a <HI>fir&s;t cau&s;e</HI> &s;till, to whom I cannot here forbear to men|tion my obligations.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;es, I tru&s;t, will pardon me, that to them I do not feel my|&s;elf obliged&mdash;for, in ju&s;tice to their
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
heavenly in&s;pirations, I believe they have never yet favoured me with one vi&s;itation; but &s;ent in their di&s;gui&s;e NECESSITY, who, being the mo|ther of Invention, gave me all mine &mdash;while FORTUNE kindly &s;miled, and was acce&s;&s;ary to the cheat.</P>
<P>But this important &s;ecret I long wi&s;hed, and endeavoured to conceal; yet one unlucky moment candidly, though unwittingly, divulged it&mdash; I frankly owned, "That Fortune having cha&s;ed away Nece&s;&s;ity, there remained no other incitement to &s;ti|mulate me to a labour I abhorred." &mdash; It happened to be in the power of the per&s;on to whom I confided
<PB N="v" REF="6">
this &s;ecret, to &s;end NECESSITY once more. &mdash; Once more, then, bowing to its empire, I &s;ubmit to the ta&s;k it enjoins.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e has &s;omething &s;imilar to a theatrical anecdote told (I think) by Colly Cibber:</P>
<Q>A performer of a very mean &s;alary, played the Apothecary in Romeo and Juliet &s;o exactly to the &s;atisfaction of the audience, that this little part, independent of the other characters, drew im|men&s;e hou&s;es whenever the play was performed &mdash; The manager in con&s;equence, thought it but ju&s;tice to advance the actor's &s;a|lary;
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
on which the poor man (who, like the character he re|pre&s;ented, had been half &s;tarved before) began to live &s;o comfort|ably, he became too plump for the part; and being of no impor|tance in any thing el&s;e, the ma|nager of cour&s;e now wholly di&s;|charged him&mdash;and thus, actually reducing him to the want of a piece of bread, in a &s;hort time he became a proper figure for the part again.</Q>
<P>Welcome, then, thou all-powerful principle, NECESSITY!&mdash;THOU, who art the in&s;tigator of &s;o many bad authors and actors &mdash; but, to their
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
&s;hame, not of all:&mdash;THOU, who from my infancy &s;eldom ha&s;t for|&s;aken me, &s;till abide with me.&mdash; I will not complain of any hard&s;hip thy commands require, &s;o thou doe&s;t not urge my pen to pro&s;titution.&mdash; In all thy rigour, oh! do not force my toil to libels&mdash;or, what is equally pernicious &mdash; panegyric on the un|worthy!</P>

<P>DOrriforth, bred at St. Omer's in all the &s;chola&s;tic rigour of that col|lege, was by education, and the &s;olemn vows of his order, a Roman Catholic prie&s;t&mdash;but nicely di&s;criminating be|tween the philo&s;ophical and the &s;uper|&s;titious part of that character, and adopting the former only, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed qualities not unworthy the fir&s;t profe&s;|&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity&mdash;every virtue which
<PB N="2" REF="10">
it was his vocation to preach, it was his care to practi&s;e; nor was he in the cla&s;s of tho&s;e of the religious, who, by &s;ecluding them&s;elves from the world; fly the merit they might have in re|forming mankind. He refu&s;ed to &s;hel|ter him&s;elf from the temptations of the layman by the walls of a cloi&s;ter, but &s;ought for, and found that &s;helter in the centre of London, where he dwelt, in his own prudence, ju&s;tice, fortitude, and temperance.</P>
<P>He was about thirty, and had lived in the metropolis near five years, when a gentleman, above his own age, but with whom he had from his youth contracted a mo&s;t &s;incere friend&s;hip, died, and left him the &s;ole guardian of his daughter, a young lady of eigh|teen.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11">The decea&s;ed Mr. Milner, on his approaching di&s;&s;olution, perfectly &s;en|&s;ible of his &s;tate, thus rea&s;oned to him|&s;elf before he made the nomination: "I have formed no intimate friend|&s;hip during my whole life, except one &mdash;I can be &s;aid to know the heart of no man except the heart of Dorriforth &mdash;After knowing his, I never &s;ought acquaintance with another&mdash;I did not wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en the exalted e&s;timation of human nature he had in&s;pired. In this moment of trembling apprehen&s;ion from every thought that darts acro&s;s my mind, much more for every action which &s;oon I mu&s;t be called to an&s;wer for; all worldly views here thrown a&s;ide, I act as if that tribunal before which I every moment expect to ap|pear, were now &s;itting in judgment upon my purpo&s;e.&mdash;The care of an
<PB N="4" REF="12">
only child is the great charge that in this tremendous cri&s;is I have to exe|cute&mdash;the&s;e earthly affections that bind me to her by cu&s;tom, &s;ympathy, or what I fondly call parental love, would direct me to &s;tudy her pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;s, and leave her to the care of &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;he &s;tyles her deare&s;t friends; but they are friends only in the &s;un&s;hine of fortune; in the cold nipping fro&s;t of di&s;appointment, &s;ickne&s;s, or connubial &s;trife, they will for&s;ake the hou&s;e of care, although the hou&s;e which they them&s;elves may have built."</P>
<P>Here the excruciating angui&s;h of the father, overcame that of the dying man.</P>
<P>"In the moment of de&s;ertion," con|tinued he, "which I now picture to
<PB N="5" REF="13">
my&s;elf, where will my child find com|fort? &mdash; That heavenly aid religion gives, which now amid&s;t the&s;e agoniz|ing tortures, chears with the bright ray of con&s;olation my frightened &s;oul; that, &s;he will be denied."</P>
<P>It is in this place proper to remark, that Mr. Milner was a member of the church of Rome, but on his marriage with a lady of Prote&s;tant tenets, they mutually agreed their &s;ons &s;hould be educated in the religious opinion of their father, and their daughters in that of their mother. One child only was the re&s;ult of their union, the child who&s;e future welfare now occupied the thoughts of her expiring father &mdash; from him the care of her education had been withheld, as he kept invio|late the promi&s;e made to her departed
<PB N="6" REF="14">
mother on the article of religion, and therefore con&s;igned his daughter to a Prote&s;tant boarding-&s;chool, from whence &s;he was &s;ent with merely &s;uch &s;enti|ments of religion, as young ladies of fa&s;hion mo&s;tly imbibe. Her little heart employed in all the endle&s;s pur&s;uits of per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, had left her mind without one ornament, except tho&s;e which nature gave, and even they were not wholly pre&s;erved from the ravages made by its rival, <HI>Art.</HI></P>
<P>While her father was in health he beheld with the extreme of delight, his accompli&s;hed daughter without one fault with which ta&s;te or elegance could have reproached her, nor ever enquired what might be her other failings &mdash; Ca&s;t on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and upon the point of leaving her to her future fate,
<PB N="7" REF="15">
tho&s;e failings at once ru&s;hed on his me|mory&mdash;and all the pride, the fond en|joyment he had taken in beholding her open the ball, or delight her hearers with her &s;prightly wit, e&s;caped his re|membrance; or not e&s;caping, were thought of with a &s;igh of contrition, or at be&s;t a contemptuous frown, at the frivolous qualification.</P>
<P>"Something more e&s;&s;ential," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "mu&s;t be con&s;idered &mdash; &s;omething to prepare her for an hour like this I now experience&mdash;can I then leave her to the charge of tho&s;e who them&s;elves never remember &s;uch an hour will come?&mdash;Dorriforth is the only per&s;on I know, who, uniting every moral virtue to tho&s;e of religion, and native honour to pious faith; will pro|tect without controuling, in&s;truct with|out
<PB N="8" REF="16">
tyrannizing, comfort without flat|tering, and perhaps in time make good by choice rather than by con&s;traint, the dear object of his dying friend's &s;ole care."</P>
<P>Dorriforth, who came po&s;t from London to vi&s;it Mr. Milner in his ill|ne&s;s, received a few moments before his death all his injunctions, and promi&s;ed to fulfil them&mdash;but in this la&s;t token of Mr. Milner's perfect e&s;teem of his friend, he &s;till re&s;trained him from all authority to direct his ward in one religious opinion contrary to tho&s;e her mother had profe&s;&s;ed, and in which &s;he her&s;elf had been educated.</P>
<P>"Never perplex her mind with an idea that may di&s;turb, but cannot re|form" &mdash; were his late&s;t words, and
<PB N="9" REF="17">
Dorriforth's reply gave him entire &s;ati&s;|faction.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner was not with her father at this affecting period&mdash;&s;ome deli|cately nervous friend, with whom &s;he was on a vi&s;it at Bath, thought proper to conceal from her not only the danger of his death, but even his indi&s;po&s;i|tion, le&s;t it might alarm a mind &s;he thought too &s;u&s;ceptible. This refined tenderne&s;s gave poor Mi&s;s Milner the almo&s;t in&s;upportable agony, of hearing her father was no more, even before &s;he was told he was not in health. In the bittere&s;t angui&s;h &s;he flew to pay her la&s;t duty to his remains, and per|formed it with the true&s;t filial love, while Dorriforth, upon important bu&s;i|ne&s;s, was obliged to return to town.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>DOrriforth returned to London hea|vily afflicted for the lo&s;s of his friend, and yet perhaps with his thoughts more engaged upon the tru&s;t that friend had repo&s;ed in him. He knew the life Mi&s;s Milner had been accu&s;|tomed to lead; he dreaded the repul&s;es his admonitions might po&s;&s;ibly meet from her; and feared he had under|taken a ta&s;k he was too weak to execute &mdash; the protection of a young woman of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Mr. Dorriforth was nearly related to one of our fir&s;t catholic peers; his income was by no means confined, but approaching to affluence, yet his at|tention
<PB N="11" REF="19">
to tho&s;e in poverty, and the moderation of his own de&s;ires were &s;uch, that he lived in all the careful plainne&s;s of oeconomy&mdash;his habitation was in the hou&s;e of a Mrs. Horton, an elderly lady, who had a maiden niece re&s;iding with her not many years younger than her&s;elf &mdash; But although Mi&s;s Woodley was thirty, and in per|&s;on exceedingly plain, yet &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch an extreme chearfulne&s;s of tem|per, and &s;uch an inexhau&s;tible fund of good nature, that &s;he e&s;caped not only the ridicule, but even the appellation of an old maid.</P>
<P>In this hou&s;e Dorriforth had lived before the death of Mr. Horton, nor upon that event did he think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, notwith&s;tanding his religious vow of celibacy, to &s;ly the roof of
<PB N="12" REF="20">
two &s;uch un&s;eductive innocent females as Mrs. Horton and her niece&mdash;on their part, they regarded him with all that re&s;pect and reverence the mo&s;t religious &s;lock regards its pa&s;tor; and his friendly &s;ociety they not only e&s;teemed a &s;piritual, but a temporal advantage, as the liberal &s;tipend he al|lowed for his apartments and board enabled them to continue in the large and commodious hou&s;e, where they had re&s;ided during the life of Mr. Horton.</P>
<P>Here, upon Mr. Dorriforth's re|turn from his journey, preparations were made for the reception of his ward, her father having made it one of his reque&s;ts that &s;he might, for a time at lea&s;t, dwell in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her guardian, receive the &s;ame
<PB N="13" REF="21">
vi&s;its, and cultivate the acquaintance of his acquaintances and friends.</P>
<P>When the will of her father was made known to Mi&s;s Milner, &s;he &s;ub|mitted without the &s;malle&s;t reluctance to all he had required&mdash;her mind, at that time impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow for his lo&s;s, made no di&s;tinction of happine&s;s that was to come; and the day was appointed, with her &s;ilent acquie&s;cence, when &s;he was to arrive in London, and take up her abode at Mrs. Horton's, with all the retinue of a rich heire&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton was delighted with the addition this acqui&s;ition to her family was likely to make to her annual in|come, and to the &s;tyle of her living. &mdash; The goodnatured Mi&s;s Woodley was
<PB N="14" REF="22">
overjoyed at the expectation of their new gue&s;t, yet &s;he her&s;elf could not tell why&mdash;but the rea&s;on was, her kind heart wanted more ample field for its benevolence; and now her thoughts were all plea&s;ingly employed how &s;he &s;hould render, not only the lady her|&s;elf, but even all her attendants, happy in their new &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The thoughts of Dorriforth were le&s;s agreeably engaged &mdash; Cares, doubts, fears, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind&mdash;&s;o forcibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, that upon every occa&s;ion which offered, he would inqui&s;itively try to gain intelligence of his ward's di&s;po&s;ition before he &s;aw her; for he was, as yet, a &s;tranger not only to the real propen&s;ities of her mind, but even to her per&s;on; a con&s;tant round of vi&s;its having prevented his meeting her at
<PB N="15" REF="23">
her father's, the very few times he had been at his hou&s;e, &s;ince her return from boarding-&s;chool. The fir&s;t per|&s;on who&s;e opinion he, with all proper re&s;erve, a&s;ked concerning Mi&s;s Milner was lady Evans, the widow of a ba|ronet who frequently vi&s;ited at Mrs, Horton's.</P>
<P>But that the reader may be inte|re&s;ted in what Dorriforth &s;ays and does, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome de&s;cription of his per&s;on and manners. His figure was tall and elegant, but his face, ex|cept a pair of dark bright eyes, a &s;et of white teeth, and a graceful fall in his clerical curls of dark brown hair, had not one feature to excite ad|miration&mdash;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed notwith&s;tand|ing &s;uch a gleam of &s;en&s;ibility diffu&s;ed over each, that many people mi&s;took
<PB N="16" REF="24">
his face for hand&s;ome, and all were more or le&s;s attracted by it&mdash;in a word, the charm that is here meant to be de|&s;cribed is a countenance&mdash;on his coun|tenance you beheld the feelings of his heart&mdash;&s;aw all its inmo&s;t workings&mdash;the quick pul&s;es that beat with hope and fear, or the placid ones that were &s;ta|tionary with patient re&s;ignation. On this countenance his thoughts were pic|tured, and as his mind was enriched with every virtue that could make it valuable, &s;o was his hone&s;t face adorned with every emblem of tho&s;e virtues &mdash;and they not only gave a lu&s;tre to his a&s;pect, but added a harmonious &s;ound to all he uttered; it was per&s;ua|&s;ive, it was perfect eloquence, whil&s;t in his looks you behold his thoughts moving with his lips, and ever coincid|ing with what he &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="25">With one of tho&s;e intere&s;ting looks which revealed the anxiety of his heart, and with that graceful re&s;traint of all ge&s;ticulation, for which he was remark|able even in his mo&s;t anxious concerns, he addre&s;&s;ed lady Evans who had called on Mrs. Horton to hear and to tell the news of the day: "Your lady&s;hip was at Bath la&s;t &s;pring&mdash;you know the young lady to whom I have the honour of being appointed guardian.&mdash;Pray"&mdash;</P>
<P>He was earne&s;tly intent upon a&s;king a que&s;tion, but was prevented by her lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Dear Mr. Dorriforth, do not a&s;k me any thing about the lady&mdash;when I &s;aw her &s;he was very young; though indeed that is but three months ago, and &s;he can't be much older now."</P>
<P>"She is eighteen." An&s;wered Dor|riforth, colouring with regret at the
<PB N="18" REF="26">
doubts her lady&s;hip had increa&s;ed, but not in&s;pired.</P>
<P>"And &s;he is very beautiful, that I can a&s;&s;ure you." Replied her lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Which I call no qualification." Said Dorriforth, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat in evident unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"But where there is nothing el&s;e," returned lady Evans, "let me tell you, beauty is &s;omething."</P>
<P>"Much wor&s;e than nothing, in my opinion." Returned Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"But now, Mr. Dorriforth, do not from what I have &s;aid, frighten your|&s;elf, and imagine the young lady wor&s;e than &s;he really is&mdash;all I know of her, is merely, that &s;he's a young, idle, indi&s;creet, giddy girl, with half a dozen lovers in her &s;uite; &s;ome coxcombs, &s;ome men of gallantry, &s;ome &s;ingle, and &s;ome married."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="27">Dorriforth &s;tarted.&mdash;"For the fir&s;t time of my life," cried he with a manly &s;orrow, "I wi&s;h I had never known her father."</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, who ex|pected every thing to happen ju&s;t as &s;he wi&s;hed, (for neither an excellent education, the be&s;t company, or long experience had been able to cultivate or brighten this good lady's under&s;tand|ing.) "Nay," &s;aid &s;he, "I am &s;ure, Mr. Dorriforth, you will &s;oon convert her from all her evil ways."</P>
<P>"Dear me," returned lady Evans, "I am &s;ure I never meant to hint at any thing evil&mdash;and for what I have &s;aid, I will give you up my authors if you plea&s;e; for they were not ob&s;erva|tions of my own; all I do is to mention them again."</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28">The good natured Mi&s;s Woodley, who &s;at working at the window, an humble li&s;tener to this di&s;cour&s;e, ven|tured on this to &s;ay exactly &s;ix words: "Then do'nt mention them any more."</P>
<P>"Let us change the &s;ubject," &s;aid Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"With all my heart," cried her lady&s;hip, "and I am &s;ure it will be to the young lady's advantage."</P>
<P>"Is &s;he tall, or &s;hort?" a&s;ked Mrs. Horton, &s;till wi&s;hing for farther infor|mation.</P>
<P>"Oh, tall enough of all con&s;cience," returned lady Evans; "I tell you again there is no fault can be found with her per&s;on."</P>
<P>"But if her mind is defective"&mdash;ex|claimed Dorriforth with a &s;igh&mdash;</P>
<P>"&mdash;That may be improved as well as the per&s;on." Cried Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="29">"No my dear," returned her lady|&s;hip, "I never heard of a pad to make &s;trait an ill-&s;hapen di&s;po&s;ition."</P>
<P>"O yes, lady Evans," a&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley, "good company, good books, experience, and the misfor|tunes of others, may have more power to form the mind to virtue, than"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Her lady&s;hip would not &s;uffer her to go on, but ri&s;ing ha&s;tily from her &s;eat, cried, "I mu&s;t be gone&mdash;I have fifty people waiting for me at home&mdash; be&s;ides, were I inclined to hear a &s;er|mon, I &s;hould de&s;ire Mr. Dorriforth to preach, and not you."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then Mrs. Hillgrave was an|nounced.&mdash;"And here is Mrs. Hill|grave."&mdash;Continued lady Evans&mdash;"I believe Mrs. Hillgrave you know Mi&s;s Milner, don't you? The young lady who has lately lo&s;t her father."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30">Mrs. Hillgrave was the wife of a merchant who had met with &s;ome &s;e|vere lo&s;&s;es, and as &s;oon as the name of Mi&s;s Milner was uttered, &s;he lifted tip her hands, and the tears &s;tarted in her eyes.</P>
<P>"There!" cried lady Evans, "I de|&s;ire you will give your opinion of her, and I am &s;orry I cannot &s;tay to hear it." Saying this, &s;he courte&s;ied and took her leave.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Hillgrave had been &s;eated a few minutes, Mrs. Horton, who loved information equal to the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive of her &s;ex, begged that lady,&mdash;"if &s;he might be permitted to know, why, at the mention of Mi&s;s Milner, &s;he had &s;eemed &s;o much af|fected?"</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31">This que&s;tion intere&s;ting the fears of Dorriforth, he turned anxiou&s;ly round attentive to the reply.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner," an&s;wered &s;he, "has been my benefactre&s;s, and the be&s;t I ever had." As &s;he &s;poke, &s;he took out her handkerchief and wiped away the tears that ran down her face.</P>
<P>"How &s;o?" cried Dorriforth eagerly, with his eyes moi&s;tened with joy, nearly as much as her's were with gratitude.</P>

<P>THIS gentlewoman's vi&s;it in&s;pired Mr. Dorriforth with &s;ome confi|dence in the principles and charac|ter of his ward.&mdash;The day arrived on which &s;he was to leave her late father's &s;eat, to take up her abode at Mrs. Horton's; and he, accompanied by Mi&s;s Woodley, went in his carriage to meet her, and waited at an inn on the road for her reception.</P>
<P>After many a &s;igh paid to the me|mory of her father, Mi&s;s Milner, upon the tenth of November, arrived at the place, half way on her journey to town, where Dorriforth and Mi&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="35">
Woodley were expecting her.&mdash;Be&s;ides attendants, &s;he had with her a gentle|man and a lady, di&s;tant relations of her mother's, who thought it but a proper te&s;timony of their civility to at|tend her part of the way, but who &s;o much envied her guardian the tru&s;t Mr. Milner had repo&s;ed in him, that as &s;oon as they had delivered her &s;afe into his care they returned.</P>
<P>When the carriage which brought Mi&s;s Milner &s;topped at the inn gate, and her name was announced to Dor|riforth, he turned pale&mdash;&s;omething like a foreboding of di&s;a&s;ter trembled at his heart, and con&s;equently darted over all his face. &mdash; Mi&s;s Woodley was even obliged to rouze him from the dejec|tion into which he was ca&s;t, or he
<PB N="28" REF="36">
would have &s;unk beneath it&mdash;&s;he was obliged al&s;o to be the fir&s;t to welcome his lovely charge.&mdash;Lovely beyond de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>But the &s;prightly vivacity, the na|tural gaietv, which report had given to Mi&s;s Milner, were &s;oftened by her recent &s;orrow to a meek &s;adne&s;s&mdash;and that haughty di&s;play of charms, im|puted to her manners, was changed to a pen&s;ive demeanor.&mdash;The in&s;tant Dor|riforth was introduced to her by Mi&s;s Woodley as her "Guardian, and her decea&s;ed father's mo&s;t beloved friend," &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, knelt down to him for a moment, and pro|mi&s;ed ever to obey him as her father. &mdash;He had his handkerchief to his face at the time, or &s;he would have beheld
<PB N="29" REF="37">
the agitation of his heart&mdash;the remo|te&s;t &s;en&s;ations of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>This affecting introduction being over, and &s;ome minutes pa&s;&s;ed in general conver&s;ation, the carriages were again ordered, and, bidding farewell to the friends who had accompanied her, Mi&s;s Milner, her guardian, and Mi&s;s Woodley departed for town; the two ladies in Mi&s;s Milner's carriage, and Dorriforth in that in which he came.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, as they rode along, made no attempts to ingratiate her&s;elf with Mi&s;s Milner; though, perhaps, it might con&s;titute one of her fir&s;t wi&s;hes&mdash;&s;he behaved to her but as &s;he con&s;tantly behaved to every other crea|ture&mdash;that was &s;ufficient to gain the

<P>AFTER a night's re&s;t in London, le&s;s &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the lo&s;s of her father, reconciled, if not already attached to her new acquaintance, her thoughts plea&s;ingly occupied with the reflection &s;he was in that gay metro|polis&mdash;a wild rapturous picture of which her active fancy had often formed&mdash; Mi&s;s Milner aro&s;e from a peaceful and refre&s;hing &s;leep, with much of that vivacity, and all tho&s;e airy charms, which for a while had yielded their tran&s;cendent power, to le&s;s potent &s;ad|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Beautiful as &s;he had appeared to Mi&s;s Woodley and to Dorriforth the
<PB N="32" REF="40">
preceding day, when &s;he joined them the next morning at breakfa&s;t, re|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of her lively elegance and dig|nified &s;implicity, they gazed at her, and at each other alternately, with wonder!&mdash;and Mrs. Horton, as &s;he &s;at at the head of her tea-table, felt her&s;elf but as a menial &s;ervant, &s;uch command has beauty if united with &s;en&s;e and with virtue.&mdash;In Mi&s;s Milner it was &s;o united. &mdash;Yet let not our over-&s;crupulous rea|ders be mi&s;led, and extend their idea of her virtue &s;o as to magnify it beyond that which frail mortals commonly po&s;&s;e&s;s; nor mu&s;t they cavil, if, on a nearer view, they find it le&s;s&mdash;but let them con&s;ider, that if Mi&s;s Milner had more faults than generally belong to others, &s;he had likewi&s;e more tempta|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="41">From her infancy &s;he had been in|dulged in all her wi&s;hes to the extreme of folly, and habitually &s;tarted at the unplea&s;ant voice of controul&mdash;&s;he was beautiful, &s;he had been too frequently told the high value of that beauty, and thought tho&s;e moments pa&s;&s;ed in wa&s;te|ful idlene&s;s during which &s;he was not gaining &s;ome new conque&s;t&mdash;&s;he had be&s;ides a quick &s;en&s;ibility, which too frequently di&s;covered it&s;elf in the imme|diate re&s;entment of injury or neglect&mdash; &s;he had acquired al&s;o the dangerous character of a wit; but to which &s;he had no real preten&s;ions, although the mo&s;t di&s;cerning critic, hearing her con|ver&s;e, might fall into this mi&s;take.&mdash; Her replies had all the effect of re|repartee, not becau&s;e &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e qualities which can properly be called wit, but that what &s;he &s;aid was &s;poken
<PB N="34" REF="42">
with an energy, an in&s;tantaneous and powerful perception of what &s;he &s;aid, joined with a real or well-counterfeited &s;implicity, a quick turn of the eye, and an arch &s;mile of the countenance.&mdash;Her words were but the words of others, and, like tho&s;e of others, put into common &s;entences; but the delivery made them pa&s;s for wit, as grace in an ill propor|tioned figure, will often make it pa&s;s for &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>And now&mdash;leaving de&s;cription&mdash;the reader mu&s;t form a judgment of her by her actions; by all the round of great or trivial circum&s;tances that &s;hall be re|lated.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t, which was ju&s;t begun at the beginning of this chapter, the conver&s;ation was lively on the part of
<PB N="35" REF="43">
Mi&s;s Milner, wi&s;e on the part of Dor|riforth, good on the part of Mi&s;s Wood|ley, and an endeavour at all three on the part of Mrs. Horton.&mdash;The di&s;cour&s;e at length drew from Mr. Dorriforth this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"You have a greater re&s;emblance of your father, Mi&s;s Milner, than I ima|gined you had from report: I did not expect to find you &s;o like him."</P>
<P>"Nor did I, Mr. Dorriforth, expect to find you any thing like what you are."</P>
<P>"No?&mdash;pray, madam, what did you expect to find me?"</P>
<P>"I expected to find you an elderly man, and a plain man."</P>
<P>This was &s;poken in an artle&s;s man|ner, but in a tone which obviou&s;ly de|clared &s;he thought her guardian both young and hand&s;ome.&mdash;He replied, but
<PB N="36" REF="44">
not without &s;ome little embarra&s;&s;ment, "A plain man you &s;hall find me in all my actions."</P>
<P>She returned, "Then your actions are to contradict your looks."</P>
<P>For in what &s;he &s;aid, Mi&s;s Milner had the quality peculiar to wits, to &s;peak the thought that fir&s;t occurs, which thought has generally truth on its &s;ide.&mdash;On this he ventured to pay her a compliment in return.</P>
<P>"You, Mi&s;s Milner, I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e, mu&s;t be a very bad judge of what is plain, and what is not."</P>
<P>"How &s;o, Sir?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e I am &s;ure you will readily own you do not think your&s;elf hand|&s;ome; and allowing that, you in&s;tantly want judgment."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45">"And I would rather want judgment than beauty," &s;he replied, "and &s;o I give up the one for the other."</P>
<P>With a &s;erious face, as if propo&s;ing a mo&s;t &s;erious que&s;tion, Dorriforth con|tinued, "And you really believe you are not hand&s;ome?"</P>
<P>"I &s;hould from my own opinion be|lieve &s;o, but in &s;ome re&s;pects I am like you Roman Catholics; I don't believe from my own under&s;tanding, but from what other people tell me."</P>
<P>"And let this be the criterion," re|plied Dorriforth, "that what we teach is truth; for you find you would be de|ceived did you not tru&s;t to per&s;ons who know better than your&s;elf. &mdash; But, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, we will talk upon &s;ome other topic, and never re&s;ume this again &mdash;we differ in opinion, I dare &s;ay, on one
<PB N="38" REF="46">
&s;ubject only, and this difference I hope will never extend it&s;elf to any other.&mdash; Therefore, let not religion be named be|tween us; for as I have re&s;olved never to per&s;ecute you, in pity be grateful, and do not per&s;ecute me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner looked with &s;urpri&s;e that any thing &s;o lightly &s;aid, &s;hould be &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly received.&mdash;The kind Mi&s;s Woodley ejaculated a &s;hort prayer to her&s;elf, that heaven would forgive her young friend the involuntary &s;in of ig|norance&mdash;while Mrs. Horton, unper|ceived as &s;he imagined, made the &s;ign of the cro&s;s upon her forehead to pre|vent the infectious taint of Heretical opinions. This, pious ceremony, Mi&s;s Milner, by chance, ob&s;erved, and now &s;hewed &s;uch an evident propen&s;ity to bur&s;t into a &s;it of laughter, that the
<PB N="39" REF="47">
good lady of the hou&s;e could no longer contain her re&s;entment, but exclaimed, "God forgive you." With a &s;everity &s;o far different from the idea the words conveyed, that the object of her anger was, on this, obliged freely to indulge that ri&s;ibility which &s;he had been &s;trug|gling to &s;mother; and without longer &s;uffering under the agony of re&s;traint, &s;he gave way to her humour, and laughed with a liberty &s;o uncontrouled, that in a &s;hort time left her in the room with none but the tender-hearted Mi&s;s Woodley a witne&s;s of her folly.</P>
<P>"My dear Mi&s;s Woodley," (then cried Mi&s;s Milner, after recovering her&s;elf,) "I am afraid you will not forgive me."</P>
<P>"No, indeed I will not." Returned Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="48">But how unimportant, how weak, how ineffectual are <HI>words</HI> in conver&s;a|tion&mdash;looks and manners alone expre&s;s &mdash;for Mi&s;s Woodley, with her charit|able face and mild accents, &s;aying &s;he would not forgive, implied only for|givene&s;s&mdash;while Mrs. Horton, with her enraged voice and a&s;pect, begging hea|ven to pardon the offender, palpably &s;aid, &s;he thought her unworthy of all pardon.</P>

<P>SIX weeks have now elap&s;ed &s;ince Mi&s;s Milner has been in London, par|taking with delight in all its plea|&s;ures, whil&s;t Dorriforth has been &s;ighing with apprehen&s;ion, attending with pre|caution, and praying with the mo&s;t zealous fervour for her &s;afety.&mdash;Her own and her guardian's acquaintance, and the new friend&s;hips (to &s;peak in the unmeaning language of the world) which &s;he was continually forming, crowded &s;o perpetually to the hou&s;e, that &s;eldom had Dorriforth even a mo|ment left from her vi&s;its or vi&s;itors, to warn her of her danger&mdash;yet when a moment offered, he &s;natched it eagerly &mdash;pre&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of "time not al|ways
<PB N="42" REF="50">
pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ociety; of reflection; of reading; of thoughts for a future &s;tate; and of virtues acquired to make old age &s;upportable."&mdash;That forcible power of innate feeling, which directs the tongue to eloquence, had its effect while &s;he li&s;tened to him, and &s;he &s;ome|times put on the looks and ge&s;ture of a&s;&s;ent, and &s;ometimes even &s;poke the language of conviction; but this, the fir&s;t call of di&s;&s;ipation would change to ill-timed raillery, or peevi&s;h remon|&s;trance at being limited in delights her birth and fortune entitled her to enjoy.</P>
<P>Among the many vi&s;itors who at|tended at her levees, and followed wherever &s;he went, was one that &s;eemed, even when ab&s;ent, to &s;hare her thoughts. &mdash;This was Lord Frederick Lawnly, the &s;on of a duke, and the avowed favou|rite
<PB N="43" REF="51">
of all the mo&s;t di&s;cerning women of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Lord Frederick was not more than twenty-three; &s;prightly, elegant, ex|tremely hand&s;ome, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every accompli&s;hment to captivate a heart le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of love than Mi&s;s Milner's was &s;uppo&s;ed to be.&mdash; With the&s;e allurements, no wonder if &s;he took a plea&s;ure in his company&mdash;no wonder if &s;he took a pride to have it known he was among the number of her mo&s;t devoted admirers.&mdash;Dorriforth beheld the growing intimacy with al|ternate pain and plea&s;ure&mdash;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee Mi&s;s Milner married, to &s;ee his charge in the protection of another, ra|ther than of him&s;elf; yet under the care of a young nobleman, immer&s;ed in all the vices of the town, without one mo|ral
<PB N="44" REF="52">
excellence, but &s;uch as might re&s;ult eventually from the influence of the moment&mdash;under &s;uch care he trembled for her happine&s;s&mdash;yet trembled more le&s;t her heart &s;hould be purloined, with|out even the authority of matrimonial views.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments Dorriforth could never di&s;gui&s;e his unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;ight of Lord Frederick, nor could his lord&s;hip but di&s;cern the &s;u&s;picion of the guardian, and con&s;equently each was embarra&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of the other.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner ob&s;erved, but ob|&s;erved with indifference, the &s;en&s;ations of both &mdash; there was but one pa&s;&s;ion which at pre&s;ent held a place in her heart, and that was vanity; vanity de|fined into all the &s;pecies of pride, vain|glory, &s;elf-approbation&mdash;an inordinate
<PB N="45" REF="53">
de&s;ire of admiration, and an immo|derate enjoyment of the art of plea&s;|ing, for her own individual happine&s;s, and not for the happine&s;s of others.&mdash; Still had &s;he a heart inclined, and often|times affected by tendencies le&s;s unwor|thy; but tho&s;e approaches to what was e&s;timable, were generally arre&s;ted in their fir&s;t impul&s;e by &s;ome darling folly.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley (who could di&s;cover virtue, although of the mo&s;t dimini|tive kind, and &s;carcely through the magnifying gla&s;s of calumny could ever perceive a fault) was Mi&s;s Mil|ner's con&s;tant companion, and her ad|vocate with Dorriforth, whenever, dur|ing her ab&s;ence, &s;he became the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;he li&s;tened with hope to the prai&s;es of her friend, but &s;aw with de&s;pair how little they were merited.&mdash;
<PB N="46" REF="54">
Sometimes he &s;truggled to contain his anger, but oftener &s;trove to &s;uppre&s;s tears of pity for her haple&s;s &s;tate.</P>
<P>By this time all her acquaintance had given Lord Frederick to her as a lover, the &s;ervants whi&s;pered it, and &s;ome of the public prints had even fixed the day of marriage;&mdash;but as no explanation had taken place on the part of his lord&s;hip, Dorriforth's unea&s;ine&s;s was en|crea&s;ed, and he &s;eriou&s;ly told his Ward he thought it prudent to entreat lord Frederick to de&s;i&s;t vi&s;iting her.&mdash;She &s;miled with ridicule at the caution, but finding it a &s;econd time repeated, and in a manner that &s;avoured of autho|rity, &s;he promi&s;ed to make, and to en|force the reque&s;t.&mdash;The next time his lord&s;hip came &s;he did &s;o, a&s;&s;uring him it was by her guardian's de&s;ire; "who
<PB N="47" REF="55">
from motives of delicacy had permitted her rather to &s;olicit as a favour, what he him&s;elf would make as a demand."&mdash; Lord Frederick reddened with anger&mdash; he loved Mi&s;s Milner, but he doubted whether (from the frequent proofs he had experienced of his own incon&s;tancy) he &s;hould continue to love&mdash;and this interference of her guardian threatened an explanation or a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, before he became thoroughly acquainted with his own heart.&mdash;Alarmed, confounded, and provoked, he replied,</P>
<P>"By heaven I believe Mr. Dorri|forth loves you him&s;elf, and it is jea|lou&s;y makes him treat me thus."</P>
<P>"For &s;hame, my lord!" cried Mi&s;s Woodley, who was pre&s;ent, and trem|bling with horror at the &s;acrilegious idea.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56">"Nay, &s;hame for him if he be not in love"&mdash; an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, "for what but a &s;avage could behold beauty like her's, and not own its power?"</P>
<P>"Habit," replied Mi&s;s Milner, "is every thing&mdash;and Mr. Dorriforth &s;ees and conver&s;es with beauty, and from habit does not fall in love, as you, my lord, merely from habit do."</P>
<P>"Then you believe," cried he, "love is not in my nature?"</P>
<P>"No more of it, my lord, than habit could very &s;oon extingui&s;h."</P>
<P>"But I would not have it extin|gui&s;hed&mdash;I would rather it &s;hould mount to a flame, for I think it a crime to be in&s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ings love can be|&s;tow."</P>
<P>"Then your lord&s;hip indulges the pa&s;&s;ion to avoid a &s;in?&mdash;the very mo|tive which deters Mr. Dorriforth."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="57">"Which ought to deter him, ma|dam, for the &s;ake of his oaths&mdash;but mona&s;tick vows, like tho&s;e of marriage, were made to be broken&mdash;and &s;urely when your guardian looks on you, his wi&s;hes"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Are never le&s;s pure," returned Mi&s;s Milner eagerly, "than tho&s;e which dwell in the bo&s;om of my cele&s;tial guardian."</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant Dorriforth entered the room. The colour had mounted into Mi&s;s Milner's face from the warmth with which &s;he had delivered her opi|nion, and his entering at the very mo|ment this compliment had been paid in his ab&s;ence, heightened the blu&s;h to a deep glow on every feature, and a con|fu&s;ion that trembled on her lips and &s;hook through all her frame.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="58">"What's the matter?" cried Dorri|forth, looking with concern on her di&s;|compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>"A compliment paid by her&s;elf to you, Sir," replied his lord&s;hip, "has thus affected the lady."</P>
<P>"As if &s;he blu&s;hed at the untruth." Said Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"Nay, that is unkind," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, "for if you had been here"&mdash;</P>
<P>"&mdash; I would not have &s;aid what I did," replied Mi&s;s Milner, "but left him to vindicate him&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible I can want vindica|tion?" returned Dorriforth, "Who would think it worth their while to &s;lander &s;o unimportant a per&s;on as I am?"</P>
<P>"The man who has the charge of Mi&s;s Milner," replied lord Frederick, "derives a con&s;equence from her."</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="59">"No ill con&s;equence, I hope, my lord?" replied Dorriforth with a firm|ne&s;s in his voice, and an eye fixed &s;o &s;tedfa&s;tly, that his lord&s;hip he&s;itated for a moment in want of a reply&mdash;and Mi&s;s Milner &s;oftly whi&s;pering to him, as her guardian turned his head, to avoid an argument, he bowed acquie&s;cence.&mdash; And then, as incompliment to her, he wi&s;hed to change the &s;ubject, with a &s;mile of ridicule he cried,</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h, Mr. Dorriforth, you would give me ab&s;olution of all my &s;ins, for I confe&s;s they are many, and manifold."</P>
<P>"Hold, my Lord," exclaimed Dorri|forth, "do not confe&s;s before the ladies, le&s;t in order to excite their compa&s;&s;ion, you &s;hould be tempted to accu&s;e your|&s;elf of &s;ins, you have never yet com|mitted."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="60">At this Mi&s;s Milner laughed, &s;eem|ingly &s;o well plea&s;ed, that lord Fre|derick with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;neer, repeated,
<Q><L>From Abelard it came,</L>
<L>And Heloi&s;a &s;till mu&s;t love the name.</L></Q>
Whether from an inattention to the quotation, or from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s it was wholly inapplicable, Dorriforth heard it without one emotion of &s;hame or of anger&mdash;while Mi&s;s Milner &s;eemed &s;hocked at the implication; her plea|&s;antry was immediately depre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he threw open the &s;a&s;h and held her head out at the window to conceal the embarra&s;&s;ment the&s;e lines had occa|&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The earl of Elmwood was at this juncture announced&mdash;a Catholic noble|man, ju&s;t come of age, and on the eve of

<P>Notwith&s;tanding that di&s;&s;imilarity of opinion, which in almo&s;t every re&s;pect, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Mi&s;s Milner and her guardian, there was generally the mo&s;t punctilious ob&s;ervance of good man|ners from each towards the other&mdash;on the part of Dorriforth more e&s;pecially; for his politene&s;s would &s;ometimes ap|pear even like the re&s;ult of a &s;y&s;tem he had marked out for him&s;elf, as the only means to keep his Ward re&s;trained with|in the &s;ame limitations.&mdash;Whenever he addre&s;&s;ed her there was an unu&s;ual re|&s;erve upon his countenance, and more than u&s;ual gentlene&s;s in his tone of voice; which &s;eemed the effect of &s;en|timents her birth and &s;ituation in&s;pired,

joined to a &s;tudied mode of re&s;pect be&s;t &s;uited to enforce the &s;ame from her. &mdash;The wi&s;hed-for con&s;equence was pro|duced&mdash;for though there was an in|&s;tinctive rectitude in the under&s;tanding of Mi&s;s Milner that would have taught her, without other in&s;truction, what manners to ob&s;erve towards her deputed father; yet, from &s;ome volatile thought, or &s;ome quick &s;en&s;e of feeling, &s;he had not been accu&s;tomed to &s;ubdue, &s;he was perpetually on the verge of treat|ing him with levity; but he would im|mediately recall her recollection by a re&s;erve too awful, and a gentlene&s;s too &s;acred for her to violate. The di&s;tinc|tion which both required, was thus, by his &s;kilful management alone, pre|&s;erved.</P>
<P>One morning he took an opportu|nity, before her and Mi&s;s Woodley, to

introduce and pre&s;s the &s;ubject of Sir Edward A&s;hton's hopes. He fir&s;t &s;poke warmly in his prai&s;e, then plainly told Mi&s;s Milner he believed &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power to make &s;o de&s;erving a man happy to the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes. A laugh of ridicule was the only an&s;wer,&mdash; but a &s;udden and expre&s;&s;ive frown from Dorriforth having quickly put an end to it, he re&s;umed his wonted polite|ne&s;s and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h, Mi&s;s Milner, you would &s;hew more good ta&s;te than thus point|edly to di&s;approve of Sir Edward."</P>
<P>"How, Mr. Dorriforth," replied &s;he, "can you expect me to give proofs of a good ta&s;te, when Sir Edward, whom you con&s;ider with &s;uch high e&s;teem, has given &s;o bad an example of his, in approving of me?"</P>
<P>Dorriforth wi&s;hed not to flatter her

frailty by a compliment &s;he &s;eemed to have &s;ought for, and for a moment he&s;itated what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>"An&s;wer, Sir, that que&s;tion." She cried,</P>
<P>"Why then, madam," replied he, "it is my opinion, that &s;uppo&s;ing what your humility has advanced to be ju&s;t, yet Sir Edward will not &s;uffer by the &s;ugge&s;tion; for in ca&s;es where the heart is &s;o immediately concerned, as I believe Sir Edward's to be, good ta&s;te, or rather rea&s;on, has not proper power to act."</P>
<P>"You are right, Mr. Dorriforth; this is a thorough ju&s;tification of Sir Edward&mdash;and when I fall in love, I mu&s;t beg you will make the &s;ame ex|cu&s;e for me."</P>
<P>"Then," returned he earne&s;tly, "be|fore your heart is in that &s;tate I have de&s;cribed, exert your rea&s;on."</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="67">"I &s;hall," an&s;wered &s;he, "and not con&s;ent to marry a man whom I could never love."</P>
<P>"Unle&s;s your heart is already given away, Mi&s;s Milner, what can make you &s;peak with &s;uch a degree of certainty?"</P>
<P>He thought on Lord Frederick while he &s;aid this, and he fixed his eyes upon her as if he wi&s;hed to penetrate her &s;entiments, and yet trembled for what he might find there.&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hed, and her looks would have confirmed her guilty, had not a free and unembar|ra&s;&s;ed tone of voice, more than her words, pre&s;erved her from that &s;en|tence.</P>
<P>"No," &s;he replied, "my heart is not given away, and yet I can venture to declare Sir Edward will never po&s;&s;e&s;s an atom of it."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="68">"I am &s;orry, for both your &s;akes, the&s;e are your &s;entiments,&mdash;he replied, "But as your heart is &s;till your own," (and he &s;eemed rejoiced to find it was) "permit me to warn you how you part with a thing &s;o precious&mdash;the dan|gers, the &s;orrows you hazard in be|&s;towing it, are greater than you may be aware of.

people &s;o &s;killed in all the weakne&s;&s;es of the bad?" Mr. Dorriforth, with all tho&s;e prudent admonitions, appears rather like a man who has pa&s;&s;ed his life in the gay world, experienced all its dangerous allurements, all its repentant &s;orrows, than like one who has lived his whole time &s;ecluded in a mona&s;try or his own &s;tudy.&mdash;Then he &s;peaks with &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility on the &s;ubject of love, he commends the very thing he would decry.&mdash;I do not think my lord Frede|rick could make the pa&s;&s;ion appear in more plea&s;ing colours by painting its delights, than Mr. Dorriforth can in de&s;cribing its &s;orrows&mdash;and if he talks to me frequently in this manner, I &s;hall certainly take pity on his lord&s;hip, for the &s;ake of his enemies eloquence."</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="70">Mi&s;s Woodley, who heard the con|clu&s;ion of this &s;peech with the tendere&s;t concern, cried, "Alas! you then think &s;eriou&s;ly of lord Frederick!"</P>

<P>"I cannot &s;peak of marriage from experience," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley, "but I think I can gue&s;s what it is."</P>
<P>"Nor can I &s;peak of love from ex|perience," replied Mi&s;s Milner, "but I think I can gue&s;s what it is."</P>
<P>"But do not fall in love, my dear Mi&s;s Milner," (cried Mi&s;s Woodley, with an earne&s;tne&s;s as if &s;he had been a&s;king a favour that depended upon the will of the per&s;on entreated,) "do

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Edward, not wholly di&s;couraged by the denial with which Dorriforth had, with delicacy, acquainted him, &s;till hoped for a kinder reception, and was &s;o frequently in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Horton, that lord Frederick's jealou&s;y was excited, and the tortures he &s;uf|fered in con&s;equence, convinced him beyond a doubt of the &s;incerity of his affection. He now, every time he be|held the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, (for he &s;till continued his vi&s;its, tho' le&s;s fre|quently than before) pleaded his cau&s;e &s;o ardently, that Mi&s;s Woodley, who was occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent, and ever com|pa&s;&s;ionate, could &s;carce re&s;i&s;t wi&s;hing him &s;ucce&s;s. He now unequivocally
<PB N="65" REF="73">
offered marriage, and entreated to be &s;uffered to lay his propo&s;als before Mr. Dorriforth, but this Mi&s;s Milner po&s;i|tively forbid.</P>
<P>Her reluctance he imputed, how|ever, more to the known partiality of her guardian to the addre&s;&s;es of Sir Edward, than to any motive which de|pended upon her&s;elf; and to Mr. Dorriforth his lord&s;hip conceived a greater di&s;like than ever; believing that through his interpo&s;ition, in &s;pite of his ward's attachment, he might yet be deprived of her&mdash;but Mi&s;s Mil|ner declared both to him and to her friend, Love had, at pre&s;ent, gained no one influence over her mind.&mdash;Yet did the watchful Mi&s;s Woodley often|times hear a &s;igh bur&s;t forth, unknow|ing to her&s;elf, till &s;he was reminded of
<PB N="66" REF="74">
it, and then a &s;udden blu&s;h of &s;hame would in&s;tantly &s;pread over her face.&mdash; This &s;eeming &s;truggle with her pa&s;&s;ion, endeared her more than ever to Mi&s;s Woodley, and &s;he would even ri&s;k the di&s;plea&s;ure of Dorriforth by her ready compliance in every new pur&s;uit that might amu&s;e the time, &s;he el&s;e &s;aw pa&s;&s;ed by her friend in heavine&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Balls, plays, ince&s;&s;ant company, at length rouzed her guardian from that mildne&s;s with which he had been ac|cu&s;tomed to treat her &mdash; night after night, his &s;leep had been di&s;turbed by fears for her &s;afety while abroad; morn|ing after morning, it had been broken by the clamour of her return.&mdash;He therefore &s;aid to her one forenoon as he met her accidentally upon the &s;tair ca&s;e,</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="75">"I hope, Mi&s;s Milner, you pa&s;s this evening at home?"</P>
<P>Unprepared for the &s;udden que&s;tion, &s;he blu&s;hed and replied, "Yes." While &s;he knew &s;he was engaged to a brilliant a&s;&s;embly, for which &s;he had been a whole week con&s;ulting her milliner in preparation.</P>
<P>She, however, flattered her&s;elf what &s;he had &s;aid to Mr. Dorriforth might be excu&s;ed as a &s;light mi&s;take, the lap&s;e of memory, or &s;ome other trifling fault, when he &s;hould know the truth&mdash; the truth was earlier divulged than &s;he expected&mdash;for ju&s;t as dinner was re|moved, her footman delivered a me&s;|&s;age to her from her milliner concern|ing a new dre&s;s for the evening&mdash;the <HI>pre&s;ent evening</HI> particularly marked.&mdash; Dorriforth looked a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="76">"I thought, Mi&s;s Milner, you gave me your word you would pa&s;s this evening at home?"</P>
<P>"I mi&s;took then&mdash;for I had before given my word I &s;hould pa&s;s it abroad."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" cried he.</P>
<P>"Yes, indeed;" returned &s;he, "and I believe it is right I &s;hould keep my fir&s;t promi&s;e; is it not?"</P>
<P>"The promi&s;e you gave me then, you do not think of any con&s;equence."</P>
<P>"Yes, certainly; if you do."</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"And mean, perhaps, to make it of much more con&s;equence than it de|&s;erves, by being offended."</P>
<P>"Whether or not, I am offended&mdash; you &s;hall find I am." And he looked &s;o.</P>
<P>She caught his piercing, &s;tedfa&s;t eye&mdash; her's were immediately ca&s;t down; and
<PB N="69" REF="77">
&s;he trembled &mdash; either with &s;hame or with re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton ro&s;e from her &s;eat&mdash; moved the decanters and the fruit round the table&mdash;&s;tirred the fire&mdash;and came back to her &s;eat again, before an|other word was uttered.&mdash;Nor had this good woman's officious labours taken the lea&s;t from the aukwardne&s;s of the &s;ilence, which as &s;oon as the bu&s;tle &s;he had made was over, returned in its full force.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Mi&s;s Milner ri&s;ing with ala|crity, was preparing to go out of the room, when Dorriforth rai&s;ed his voice, and in a tone of authority &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner, you &s;hall not leave the hou&s;e this evening."</P>
<P>"Sir?"&mdash;&s;he exclaimed with a kind of doubt of what &s;he had heard&mdash;a &s;ur|pri&s;e,
<PB N="70" REF="78">
which fixed her hand on the door &s;he had half opened, but which now &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf irre&s;olute whether to open wide in defiance, or to &s;hut &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive. &mdash; Before &s;he could re&s;olve, Dorriforth aro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;aid with a degree of force and warmth &s;he had never heard him &s;peak with before.</P>
<P>"I command you to &s;tay at home this evening."</P>
<P>And he walked immediately out of the apartment by the oppo&s;ite door. &mdash;Her hand fell motionle&s;s from that &s;he held &mdash; &s;he appeared motionle&s;s her&s;elf for &s;ome time; &mdash; till Mrs. Horton, "be&s;eeching her not to be unea&s;y at the treatment &s;he had re|ceived," cau&s;ed a flood of tears to flow, and her bo&s;om to heave as if her heart was breaking.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="79">Mi&s;s Woodley would have &s;aid &s;ome|thing to comfort her, but &s;he had caught the infection and could not ut|ter a word&mdash;not from any real cau&s;e of grief did this lady weep; but there was a magnetic quality in tears, which al|ways drew forth her's.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton &s;ecretly enjoyed this &s;cene, although the real well meaning of her heart, and ea&s;e of her con&s;cience, did not tell her &s;o&mdash;&s;he, however, de|clared &s;he had "long progno&s;ticated it would come to this;" and &s;he "now only thanked heaven it was no wor&s;e."</P>
<P>"What would you have wor&s;e, ma|dam?" cried Mi&s;s Milner, "am not I di&s;appointed of the ball?"</P>
<P>"You don't mean to go then?" &s;aid Mrs. Horton; "I commend your prudence; and I dare &s;ay it is more
<PB N="72" REF="80">
than your guardian gives you credit for."</P>
<P>"Do you think I would go," an|&s;wered Mi&s;s Milner, with an earne&s;tne&s;s that for a time &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her tears, "in contradiction to his will?"</P>
<P>"It is not the fir&s;t time, I believe, you have acted contrary to that, Mi&s;s Milner." Returned Mrs. Horton, and affected a tenderne&s;s of voice, to &s;often the har&s;hne&s;s of her words.</P>
<P>"If that is the ca&s;e, madam," re|plied Mi&s;s Milner, "I &s;ee nothing that &s;hould prevent me now." And &s;he flung out of the room as if &s;he had re|&s;olved to di&s;obey him.&mdash;This alarmed poor Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"Dear Aunt," &s;he cried to Mrs. Horton, "follow and prevail upon Mi&s;s Milner to give up her de&s;ign; &s;he means
<PB N="73" REF="81">
to go to the ball in oppo&s;ition to her guardian's will."</P>
<P>"Then," cried Mrs. Horton, "I'll not be an in&s;trument in deterring her&mdash; if &s;he does, it may be for the be&s;t; it may give Mr. Dorriforth a clearer knowledge what means are proper to u&s;e, to convert her from evil."</P>
<P>"But, dear madam, &s;he mu&s;t be prevented the evil of di&s;obedience; and as you tempted, you will be the mo&s;t likely to di&s;&s;uade her&mdash;but if you will not, I mu&s;t endeavour."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was leaving the room to perform this good de&s;ign, when Mrs. Horton, in humble imitation of the ex|ample given her by Dorriforth, cried,</P>
<P>"Niece, I command you not to &s;tir out of this room, this evening."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley obediently &s;at down&mdash; and though her thoughts and heart
<PB N="74" REF="82">
were in the chamber with her friend, &s;he never &s;hewed by one impertinent word, or by one line of her face, the re&s;traint &s;he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual hour, Mr. Dorriforth and his ward were &s;ummoned to tea:&mdash; Dorriforth entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger; his eye gave te&s;timony of his ab&s;ent thoughts; and although he took up a pamphlet and affected to read, it was plain to di&s;cern he &s;carcely knew he held it in his hand.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton began to make tea with a mind as wholly intent upon &s;omething el&s;e, as Dorriforth's&mdash;&s;he was longing for the event of this mi&s;under|&s;tanding, (for to age trivial matters are important,) and though &s;he wi&s;hed no
<PB N="75" REF="83">
ill to Mi&s;s Milner, yet with an inclina|tion bent upon &s;eeing &s;omething new&mdash; without the fatigue of going out of her own hou&s;e &mdash; &s;he was not over &s;cru|pulous what that novelty might be.&mdash; But for fear &s;he &s;hould have the im|prudence to &s;peak a word upon the &s;ubject which employed her thoughts, or even look as if &s;he thought of it at all; &s;he pinched her lips clo&s;e together, and ca&s;t her eyes on vacancy, le&s;t their &s;ignificant regards might detect her.&mdash; And for fear any noi&s;e &s;hould intercept even the &s;ound of what might happen, &s;he walked acro&s;s the room more &s;oftly than u&s;ual, and more &s;oftly touched every thing &s;he was obliged to lay her hand on.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley thought it her duty to be mute, and now the gentle gingle
<PB N="76" REF="84">
of a tea-&s;poon, was like a deep-toned bell, all was &s;o quiet.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton too, in the &s;elf-approv|ing reflection that &s;he her&s;elf was not in any quarrel, or altercation of any kind, felt at this moment remarkably peaceful, and charitable.&mdash;Mi&s;s Wood|ley did not recollect <HI>her&s;elf</HI> &s;o, but was &s;o in reality&mdash;in her peace and charity were in&s;tinctive virtues, accident could not encrea&s;e them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cups of tea were &s;carcely poured out, when a &s;ervant came with Mi&s;s Milner's compliments and &s;he &s;hould drink none.&mdash;The book &s;haked in Dorriforth's hand while this me&s;&s;age was delivered&mdash;he believed her to be dre&s;&s;ing for her evening's entertainment, and now &s;tudied in what manner to prevent, or to re&s;ent it.&mdash;He coughed
<PB N="77" REF="85">
&mdash;drank his tea&mdash;endeavoured to talk, but found it difficult&mdash;&s;ometimes read &mdash;and in this manner near two hours were pa&s;&s;ed away, when Mi&s;s Milner came into the room.&mdash;Not dre&s;t for ball, but as &s;he had ro&s;e from dinner. &mdash; Dorriforth read on, and &s;eemed afraid to look up, le&s;t he &s;hould behold what he could not have pardoned.&mdash; &s;he drew a chair and &s;at down at the table by the &s;ide of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>After a few minutes pau&s;e, and &s;ome &s;mall embarra&s;&s;ment on the part of Mrs. Horton, at the di&s;appointment &s;he had to contend with from Mi&s;s Mil|ner's unexpected obedience, &s;he a&s;ked that young lady "if &s;he would now take tea?"&mdash;to which Mi&s;s Milner replied, "no, I thank you, ma'am," in a voice &s;o languid, compared to her u&s;ual one,
<PB N="78" REF="86">
that Dorriforth lifted his eyes from the book; and &s;eeing her in the &s;ame negligent dre&s;s &s;he had worn all the day, ca&s;t them away again&mdash;not with a look of triumph, but of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>And whatever he might have &s;uf|fered had he beheld her decorated, and on the point of bidding defiance to his commands, yet even upon that trial, he had not endured half the painful &s;en&s;ations he now for a moment felt&mdash; he felt him&s;elf to blame.</P>
<P>He feared he had treated her with too much &s;everity&mdash;he admired her conde|&s;cen&s;ion, accu&s;ed him&s;elf for exacting it &mdash;he longed to a&s;k her pardon, he did not know how.</P>
<P>A chearful reply from her, to a que&s;|tion of Mi&s;s Woodley's, embarra&s;&s;ed him &s;till more&mdash;he wi&s;hed &s;he had been
<PB N="79" REF="87">
fullen, he then would have had a temp|tation, or a pretence, to have been &s;o too.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e thoughts crowding fa&s;t on his mind he &s;till read, or &s;eemed to read, and to take no notice of what was pa&s;&s;ing; till a &s;ervant entered and a&s;ked Mi&s;s Milner what time &s;he &s;hould want the chariot? to which &s;he replied, "I don't go out to night."&mdash;He then laid the book out of his hand, and by the time the &s;ervent had left the room, thus began.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner, I give you, I fear, &s;ome unkind proofs of my regard&mdash;it is often the ungrateful ta&s;k of a friend to be trouble&s;ome &mdash; &s;ometimes unman|nerly.&mdash;Forgive the duty of my office, and believe no one is half &s;o much
<PB N="80" REF="88">
concerned if it robs you of any amu&s;e|ments, as I my&s;elf am."</P>
<P>What he &s;aid, he looked with &s;o much &s;incerity, that had &s;he been burn|ing with rage at his behaviour, &s;he mu&s;t have forgiven him, for the regret he &s;o forcibly expre&s;t.&mdash;She was going to reply, but found &s;he could not with|out accompanying her words with tears, therefore as &s;oon as &s;he attempted &s;he de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>On this he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and going to her, &s;aid, "Once more &s;hew your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by obeying me a &s;e|cond time to day.&mdash;Keep your appoint|ment, and be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall i&s;&s;ue my commands with greater circum&s;pection for the future, as I find how &s;trictly they are complied with."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, the gay, the proud, the haughty Mi&s;s Milner, &s;unk under|neath
<PB N="81" REF="89">
this kindne&s;s, and wept with a gentlene&s;s and patience, which did not give more &s;urpri&s;e than it gave &s;atisfac|tion to Dorriforth.&mdash;He was charmed to find her di&s;po&s;ition &s;o little untractable &mdash;forboded the future pro&s;perity of his guardian&s;hip, and her eternal, as well as temporal happine&s;s from this &s;pecimen.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH Dorriforth was that good man that has been de&s;cribed, there was in his nature &s;hades of evil&mdash;there was an ob&s;tinacy; &s;uch as he him&s;elf, and his friends termed firmne&s;s of mind; but had not religion and &s;ome oppo&s;ite virtues weighed heavy in the balance, it would frequently have de|generated into implacable &s;tubbornne&s;s.</P>
<P>The child of a once beloved &s;i&s;ter, who married a young officer again&s;t her brother's con&s;ent, was at the age of three years left an orphan, de&s;titute of every &s;upport but from his uncle's ge|nero&s;ity: but though Dorriforth men|tioned, he would never &s;ee him. Mi&s;s

Milner, who&s;e heart was a receptacle for the unfortunate, no &s;ooner was told the melancholy hi&s;tory of Mr. and Mrs. Ru&s;|brook, the parents of the child, than &s;he longed to behold the innocent inheritor of her guardian's re&s;entment, and took Mi&s;s Woodley with her to &s;ee the boy&mdash; he was at a farm hou&s;e a few miles from town; and his extreme beauty and en|gaging manners, needed not the &s;orrows to which he had been born, to give him farther recommendation to the kindne&s;s of her, who had come to vi&s;it him.

This idea was no &s;ooner formed than executed. &mdash; By making a pre&s;ent to the nur&s;e, &s;he readily gained her con|&s;ent to part with him for a day or two, and the &s;igns of joy the child denoted on being put into the carriage, &s;eemed to repay her before-hand, for every re|proof &s;he might receive from her guar|dian, for the liberty &s;he had taken.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides," &s;aid &s;he to Mi&s;s Woodley, who had &s;till her apprehen&s;ions, "do you not wi&s;h his uncle &s;hould have &s;ome warmer intere&s;t in his care than duty? &mdash;it is that alone, which induces Mr. Dorriforth to provide for him, but it is proper, affection, &s;hould have &s;ome &s;hare in his benevolence&mdash;and how, hereafter,

will he be &s;o fit an object for that love, which compa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t excite, as he is at pre&s;ent?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley acquie&s;ced.&mdash;But be|fore they arrived at their own door it came into Mi&s;s Milner's remembrance, there was a grave &s;ternne&s;s in the man|ners of her guardian when provoked; the recollection of which, made her &s;omething apprehen&s;ive for what &s;he had done&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley was more &s;o. &mdash;They both became &s;ilent as they ap|proached the &s;treet where they lived&mdash; for Mi&s;s Woodley having once repre|&s;ented her fears, and having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them in re&s;ignation to Mi&s;s Milner's better judgment, would not repeat them&mdash;and Mi&s;s Milner would not con|fe&s;s they were now troubling her.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t, however, as the coach &s;topt, &s;he had the foreca&s;t and the humility
<PB N="86" REF="94">
to &s;ay, "we will not tell Mr. Dorri|forth the child is his nephew, Mi&s;s Woodley, unle&s;s he &s;hould appear fond, and plea&s;ed with him, and then we may venture without any danger."</P>
<P>This was agreed, and when Dorri|forth entered the room ju&s;t before din|ner, poor Harry Ru&s;brook was intro|duced to him as the &s;on of a lady who frequently vi&s;ited there. The decep|tion pa&s;&s;ed &mdash; Dorriforth &s;hook hands with him, and at length highly plea&s;ed with his engaging wiles, and applica|ble replies, took him on his knee, and ki&s;&s;ed him with affection. Mi&s;s Mil|ner could &s;carcely re&s;train the joy this gave her; but unluckily, Dorriforth &s;aid &s;oon after to the child, "and now tell me your name."</P>
<P>"Harry Ru&s;brook." Replied he with great force and clearne&s;s in his voice.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="95">Dorriforth was holding him fondly round the wai&s;t as he &s;tood with his feet upon his knees; and at this reply he did not throw him from him&mdash;but he removed his hands, which &s;upported him, &s;o &s;uddenly, that the child to pre|vent falling on the floor, threw him&s;elf about his uncle's neck.&mdash;Mi&s;s Milner and Mi&s;s Woodley turned a&s;ide to con|ceal their tears. "I had liked to have been down." Cried Harry, fearing no other danger.&mdash;But his uncle took hold of each hand that had twined around him, and placed him immediately on the ground; and dinner being that in&s;tant &s;erved, he gave no greater marks of his re&s;entment than calling for his hat, and walking in&s;tantly out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner cried for anger; yet &s;he did not treat with le&s;s kindne&s;s the ob|ject

of this vexatious circum&s;tance: &s;he held him in her arms all the while &s;he &s;at at table, and repeatedly &s;aid to him, (though he had not the &s;en&s;e to thank her) "&s;he would always be his friend."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t emotions of re&s;entment again&s;t Dorriforth being over, &s;he was ea&s;ily prevailed upon to re|turn with poor Ru&s;brook to the farm hou&s;e, before it was likely his uncle &s;hould come back; another in&s;tance of obedience which Mi&s;s Woodley was impatient her guardian &s;hould know; &s;he therefore enquired where he was, and &s;ent him a note to acquaint him with it, offering at the &s;ame time an apology for what had happened.

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few things &s;o mortify|ing to a proud &s;pirit as to &s;uffer by immediate compari&s;on &mdash; men, can &s;carcely bear this humiliation, but to women the puni&s;hment is intolerable; and Mi&s;s Milner now laboured under the di&s;advantage to a degree, which gave her no &s;mall inquietude.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fenton, a young lady of the mo&s;t delicate beauty, elegant manners, gentle di&s;po&s;ition, and di&s;creet con|duct, was introduced to Mi&s;s Milner's acquaintance by her guardian; and fre|quently, &s;ometimes inadvertently, held up by him as a pattern for her to fol|low&mdash;for when he did not &s;ay this in
<PB N="91" REF="99">
direct terms, it was in&s;inuated by the warmth of his panegyricks on tho&s;e virtues in which Mi&s;s Fenton excelled, and his ward was obviou&s;ly deficient. Con&s;cious of her inferiority in the&s;e &s;ub|jects of her guardian's prai&s;e, Mi&s;s Mil|ner, in&s;tead of being in&s;pired to emula|tion, was provoked to envy.</P>
<P>Not to admire Mi&s;s Fenton was im|po&s;&s;ible&mdash;to find a fault in her per&s;on or &s;entiments was equally impo&s;&s;ible&mdash; and yet to love her, was very unlikely.</P>
<P>That &s;erinity of mind which kept her features in a continual placid form, though enchanting at the fir&s;t glance, upon a &s;econd, or third, fatigued the &s;ight for a want of variety; and to have &s;een her di&s;torted with rage, con|vul&s;ed with mirth, or in deep dejection had been to her advantage.&mdash;But her
<PB N="92" REF="100">
&s;uperior &s;oul appeared above tho&s;e na|tural commotions of the mind, and there was more inducement to wor&s;hip her as a &s;aint, than to love her as a woman.&mdash;Yet Dorriforth, who&s;e heart was not formed (at lea&s;t not educated) for love; regarding her in the light of friend&s;hip, beheld her as the mo&s;t per|fect model for her &s;ex, Lord Frede|rick on fir&s;t &s;eeing her was &s;truck with her beauty, and Mi&s;s Milner appre|hended &s;he had introduced a rival; but he had not &s;een her three times, before he called her the mo&s;t "in&s;ufferable of Heaven's creatures," and vowed there was more charming variation in the features of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had a heart affectionate to her &s;ex, even where &s;he &s;aw them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of charms &s;uperior to her
<PB N="93" REF="101">
own; but whether from the &s;pirit of contradiction, whether from feeling her|&s;elf more than ordinarily offended by her guardian's prai&s;e of this lady, or whether there was &s;omething in the re|&s;erve of Mi&s;s Fenton that did not ac|cord with her own frank and ingenuous di&s;po&s;ition &s;o as to engage her e&s;teem, it is certain &s;he took infinite &s;atisfaction in hearing her beauty and her virtues depreciated, or turned to ridicule, par|ticularly if Mr. Dorriforth was pre&s;ent. This was very painful to him upon many accounts; perhaps regard to Mi&s;s Milner's conduct was not among the lea&s;t; and whenever the circum&s;tance occurred, he could with difficulty re|&s;train his anger. Mi&s;s Fenton was not only a young lady who&s;e amiable qua|lities Dorriforth admired, but &s;he was &s;oon to be allied to him by her marriage
<PB N="94" REF="102">
with his neare&s;t relation, lord Elmwood, a young nobleman whom he &s;incerely loved.</P>
<P>Lord Elmwood had di&s;covered all that beauty in Mi&s;s Fenton which every common ob&s;erver could not but &s;ee&mdash; the charms of her mind and her fortune had been pointed out to him by his Tutor; and the utility of their marriage in perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his precepts, his lord&s;hip never permitted him&s;elf to que&s;tion.</P>
<P>This Preceptor, held with a magi&s;|terial power the government of his pupil's pa&s;&s;ions; nay, governed them &s;o entirely, no one could perceive (nor did the young lord him&s;elf know) that he had any.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="103">This rigid monitor and friend, was a Mr. Sandford, bred a je&s;uit in the &s;ame college where Dorriforth was educated, but before his time the or|der was compelled to take another name.&mdash;Sandford had been the tutor of Dorriforth as well as of his cou&s;in lord Elmwood, and by this double tie &s;eemed now entailed upon the family.&mdash; As a je&s;uit, he was con&s;equently a man of learning; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;teadine&s;s to accompli&s;h the end of any de&s;ign once meditated, and of wi&s;dom to direct the conduct of men more power|ful, but le&s;s ingenious than him&s;elf. The young earl accu&s;tomed in his in|fancy to fear him as his ma&s;ter, in his youth and manhood received every new indulgence with which his precep|tor favoured him with gratitude, and became at length to love him as his
<PB N="96" REF="104">
father&mdash;nor had Dorriforth as yet &s;hook off &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Mr. Sandford perfectly knew how to work upon the pa&s;&s;ions of all human nature, but yet had the con&s;cience not to "draw all hearts towards him."&mdash; There were of mankind, tho&s;e, who&s;e hate he thought not unworthy his holy labour; and in that, he was more rapid in his &s;ucce&s;s than even in procuring e&s;teem. In this enterprize he &s;ucceeded with Mi&s;s Milner, even beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;h.</P>
<P>She had been educated at an Engli&s;h boarding &s;chool, and had no idea of the &s;uperior, and &s;ubordinate &s;tate of a foreign &s;eminary&mdash;be&s;ides, as a woman, &s;he was privileged to &s;ay any thing &s;he plea&s;ed; and as a beautiful woman, &s;he
<PB N="97" REF="105">
had a right to expect whatever &s;he plea&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;hould be admired.</P>
<P>Sandford knew the hearts of women, as well as tho&s;e of men, notwith&s;tanding he had pa&s;&s;ed but little of his time in their &s;ociety &mdash; he &s;aw Mi&s;s Milner's heart at the fir&s;t view of her per&s;on; and beholding in that little circum|ference a weight of folly he wi&s;hed to &s;ee eradicated, he began to toil in the vineyard, eager to draw upon him her dete&s;tation, in the hope he could al&s;o make her abominate her&s;elf. The mortifications of &s;light he was expert in, and being a man of talents, &s;uch as all companies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e Mi&s;s Milner often frequented, looked on with re&s;pect, he did not begin by wa&s;ting that reverence &s;o highly valued upon ineffectual remon&s;trances, of which
<PB N="98" REF="106">
he could fore&s;ee the reception, but awakened the attention of the lady &s;olely by his neglect of her. He &s;poke of her in her pre&s;ence as of an indiffer|ent per&s;on; &s;ometimes forgot to name her when the &s;ubject required it; and then would a&s;k her pardon and &s;ay he "did not recollect her," with &s;uch &s;eeming &s;orrow for his fault, &s;he could not think the offence intended, and of cour&s;e felt the affront much more &s;e|verely.</P>
<P>While, with every other per&s;on &s;he was the principle, the fir&s;t cau&s;e upon which a whole company depended for conver&s;ation, mu&s;ick, cards, or danc|ing, with Mr. Sandford &s;he found &s;he was of no importance.&mdash;Sometimes &s;he tried to con&s;ider this di&s;regard of her as merely the effect of ill-breeding, but he
<PB N="99" REF="107">
was not an ill-bred man; he was a gen|tleman by birth, and one who had kept the be&s;t company; a man of &s;en&s;e and learning.&mdash;"And does &s;uch a man &s;light me without knowing it?" She cried&mdash; for &s;he had not dived &s;o deep into the powers of &s;imulation, as to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch carele&s;s manners were the re&s;ult of art.</P>
<P>This behaviour of Mr. Sandford's had its de&s;ired effect; it humbled Mi&s;s Milner in her own opinion, more than a thou&s;and &s;ermons would have done preached on the vanity of youth and beauty. She felt an inward no|thingne&s;s &s;he never knew before, and had been cured of all her pride, had &s;he not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a degree of &s;pirit beyond the generality of her &s;ex, and &s;uch as even Mr. Sandford with all his penetration did not expect.&mdash;She deter|mined
<PB N="100" REF="108">
to re&s;ent his treatment, and en|tering the li&s;t as his declared enemy, give rea&s;ons to the beholders why he did not, with them, acknowledge her &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>She now commenced ho&s;tilities on all his arguments, his learning, and his favourite axioms; and by a happy turn for ridicule, in want of other weapons, threw in the way of the holy Father as great trials for his patience, as any his order could have &s;ub&s;tituted in penance. Some things he bore like a martyr&mdash;at others, his fortitude would for&s;ake him, and he would call on her guardian, his late pupil, to interpo&s;e with his autho|rity; on which &s;he would declare &s;he only acted "to try the good man's temper," and had he combated with his fretfulne&s;s but a few minutes longer, &s;he
<PB N="101" REF="109">
would have acknowledged his right to cannonization; but having yielded to the &s;allies of his anger, he mu&s;t now go through numerous other probations."</P>
<P>If Mi&s;s Fenton was admired by Dor|riforth, by Sandford &s;he was adored&mdash; and in&s;tead of giving her as an exam|ple to Mi&s;s Milner, he &s;poke of her as of one, endowed beyond Mi&s;s Milner's power of imitation.&mdash;Often with a &s;hake of his head and a &s;igh would he &s;ay,</P>
<P>"No, I am not &s;o hard upon you as your guardian; I only de&s;ire you to love Mi&s;s Fenton; to re&s;emble her, I believe, is above your ability."</P>
<P>This was &s;omething too much&mdash;and poor Mi&s;s Woodley, who was generally a witne&s;s of the&s;e controver&s;ies, &s;uffered a degree of &s;orrow at every &s;entence
<PB N="102" REF="110">
that di&s;tre&s;t Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;Yet as &s;he &s;uffered for Mr. Sandford too, the joy of her friend's reply was abated by the unea&s;ine&s;s it gave to him. But Mrs. Horton felt for none but the right re|verend prie&s;t; and often did &s;he feel &s;o violently intere&s;ted in his cau&s;e, &s;he could not refrain giving an an&s;wer her|&s;elf in his behalf&mdash;thus, doing the duty of an adver&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Sandford finding his friend Dor|riforth frequently perplexed in the man|agement of his ward, and he him&s;elf thinking her incorrigible, gave his ad|vice, that a proper match &s;hould be im|mediately &s;ought out for her, and the care of &s;o dangerous a per&s;on given into other hands. Dorriforth acknow|ledged the propriety of this council, but lamented the difficulty there was in plea&s;ing his ward as to the quality of her lover, for &s;he had refu&s;ed, be&s;ides Sir Edward A&s;hton, many others of equal preten&s;ions. "Depend upon it then," cried Mr. Sandford, "her af|fections are already engaged, and it is proper you &s;hould know to whom."&mdash;
<PB N="104" REF="112">
Dorriforth thought he did know, and mentioned lord Frederick Lawnly; but &s;aid he had no farther authority for the &s;uppo&s;ition, than what his ob&s;erva|tion had given him, for that every ex|planation both on his lord&s;hip's &s;ide, and on that of the lady's, were evaded. &mdash;"Take her then," cried Sandford, "into the country, and if his Lord|&s;hip does not follow, there is an end to your &s;u&s;picions."&mdash;"I &s;hall not ea&s;ily prevail upon Mi&s;s Milner to leave the town," replied Dorriforth, "while it is in its highe&s;t fa&s;hion; while all the gay world are re&s;orted hither."&mdash;"You can but try," returned Sandford, "and if you &s;hould not &s;ucceed now; at lea&s;t fix the time you mean to go during the Autumn, and keep to your determina|tion."&mdash;"But in the Autumn," replied Dorriforth, "lord Frederick will of
<PB N="105" REF="113">
cour&s;e be in the country, and as his uncle's e&s;tate is near to our re&s;idence, he will not then &s;o evidently follow Mi&s;s Milner, as he would, could I in|duce her to go now."</P>
<P>It was agreed the attempt &s;hould be made &mdash; and in&s;tead of receiving the propo&s;al with unea&s;ine&s;s, Mi&s;s Milner, to the &s;urpri&s;e of every one pre&s;ent, im|mediately con&s;ented; and gave her guar|dian an opportunity of &s;aying &s;everal of the kinde&s;t and polite&s;t things upon her ready compliance.</P>
<P>"A token of approbation from you, Mr. Dorriforth," returned &s;he, "I al|ways con&s;idered with the highe&s;t e&s;ti|mation&mdash;but your commendations are now become infinitely &s;uperior in value, by their &s;carcity; for I do not believe that &s;ince Mi&s;s Fenton and Mr. Sand|ford
<PB N="106" REF="114">
came to town, I have received one te&s;timony of your friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>Had the&s;e words been uttered with plea&s;antry, they might have pa&s;&s;ed with|out ob&s;ervation; but at the conclu&s;ion of the period, re&s;entment flew to Mi&s;s Milner's face, and &s;he darted a pier|cing look at Mr. Sandford, which more pointedly expre&s;&s;ed &s;he was angry with him, than had &s;he &s;poken volumes in her u&s;ual &s;train of raillery.&mdash;Dorriforth looked confu&s;ed&mdash;but the concern which &s;he had &s;o plainly evinced for his good opinion throughout what &s;he had &s;aid, &s;ilenced any rebuke he might el&s;e have been tempted to give her, for this un|warrantable charge again&s;t his friend.&mdash; Mrs. Horton was &s;hocked at the irre|verent manner in which Mr. Sandford was treated &mdash; while Mi&s;s Woodley
<PB N="107" REF="115">
turned to him with a &s;mile upon her face, hoping to &s;et him an example of the manner in which he &s;hould receive this reproach.&mdash;Her good wi&s;hes did not &s;ucceed&mdash;yet he was perfectly un|ruffled, and replied with coolne&s;s,</P>
<P>"The air of the country has affected the young lady already&mdash;but it is a comfortable thing," continued he, "that in the variety of humours &s;ome women are expo&s;ed to, they cannot be &s;teadfa&s;t even in deceit."</P>
<P>"Deceit," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "in what am I deceitful? did I ever pretend Sir, I had an e&s;teem for you?"</P>
<P>"That had not been deceit, madam, but merely good manners."</P>
<P>"I never, Mr. Sandford, &s;acrificed truth to politene&s;s."</P>
<P>"Except when the country has been propo&s;ed, and you thought it politene&s;s to appear &s;atisfied."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="116">"And I was &s;atisfied, till I recollected you might probably be of the party&mdash; then every grove was changed to a wil|derne&s;s, every rivulet into a &s;tagnated pool, and every &s;inging bird into a croaking raven."</P>
<P>"A very poetical de&s;cription." Re|turned he calmly.&mdash;"But, Mi&s;s Mil|ner, you need not have had any appre|hen&s;ions of my company in the country, for I under&s;tand the &s;eat to which your guardian means to go, belongs to you; and depend upon it, madam, I &s;hall never enter a hou&s;e where you are the mi&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>"Nor any hou&s;e I am certain, Mr. Sandford, but where you your&s;elf are the ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>"What do you mean, madam? (and for the fir&s;t time he elevated his voice,) am I the ma&s;ter here?"</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="117">"Your &s;ervants," replied &s;he look|ing at the company, "will not tell you &s;o, but I do."</P>
<P>"You conde&s;cend, Mr. Sandford," cried Mrs. Horton, "in talking &s;o much to a young woman; but I know you do it for her good."</P>
<P>"Well, Mi&s;s Milner," cried Dorri|forth, (and the mo&s;t cutting thing he could &s;ay,) "&s;ince I find my propo&s;al of the country has put you out of hu|mour, I &s;hall mention it no more."</P>
<P>With all that va&s;t quantity of re&s;ent|ment, anger, or rage which &s;ometimes boiled in the veins of Mi&s;s Milner, &s;he was yet never wanting in that re&s;pect towards her guardian, which with-held her from uttering one angry &s;entence, immediately directed to him; and a &s;evere word on his &s;ide, in&s;tead of exa&s;|perating,
<PB N="110" REF="118">
was &s;ure to &s;often her. Such was the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent &mdash; his words &s;eemed to cut her to the heart, but &s;he had not the a&s;perity to reply to them as &s;he thought they merited, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;Dorriforth, in&s;tead of being concerned, as he u&s;ually was at &s;eeing her unea&s;y, appeared on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion provoked.&mdash;He thought her weeping was a new reproach to his friend Mr. Sandford, and to &s;uffer him|&s;elf to be moved by it, he con&s;idered would be a tacit condemnation of his friend's conduct. &mdash; She under&s;tood his thoughts, and getting the better of her tears, apologized for the weakne&s;s of which &s;he had been guilty; adding,</P>
<P>"She could never bear with indiffer|ence an unju&s;t accu&s;ation."</P>
<P>"To prove mine was &s;uch, madam," replied Dorriforth, "be prepared to
<PB N="111" REF="119">
quit London, without any marks of re|gret, within a few days."</P>
<P>She bowed a&s;&s;ent; the nece&s;&s;ary pre|parations were agreed upon; and while Mi&s;s Milner with apparent &s;atisfaction adju&s;ted the plan of her journey, (like tho&s;e per&s;ons who behave well, not &s;o much to plea&s;e them&s;elves as to vex their enemies,) &s;he &s;ecretly triumphed in the mortification &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Sandford would receive, from her obe|dient behaviour.</P>
<P>The news of this intended journey was &s;oon made public. There is a &s;e|cret charm in being pitied, when the misfortune is but ideal, and Mi&s;s Mil|ner found immen&s;e gratification in be|ing told, "her's was a cruel ca&s;e," and that it was "unju&s;t and barbarous to force &s;o much beauty to be concealed

The&s;e things, and a thou&s;and &s;uch, a thou&s;and times repeated, &s;he &s;till li&s;tened to with plea&s;ure; yet pre|&s;erved the con&s;tancy not to &s;hrink from her re&s;olution of &s;ubmitting.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;ighs, which Mi&s;s Woodley had long ago ob&s;erved, became, how|ever, more frequent &s;till; and a tear half &s;tarting to her eye was an additi|onal matter of her friends ob&s;ervation. Yet though Mi&s;s Milner at tho&s;e times was &s;oftened to melancholy, &s;he by no means appeared unhappy. Mi&s;s Wood|ley was acquainted with the name of love only, yet &s;he concluded from the&s;e encrea&s;ed &s;ymptoms, what &s;he before only &s;u&s;pected, that love <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be then

"Her &s;en&s;es have been capti|vated by the per&s;on and accompli&s;h|ments of Lord Frederick," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley to her&s;elf, "while her un|der&s;tanding beholds his faults, and re|proaches her pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and, oh!" cried &s;he, "could her guardian and Mr. Sandford know of this conflict, how much more would they have to admire than to condemn!"</P>

<P>WITH this party Mi&s;s Milner ar|rived at her country hou&s;e, and for near &s;ix weeks all around was the per|fect picture of tranquillity;&mdash;her &s;ati&s;|faction was as evident as every other per|&s;on's; and every &s;evere reflection being at this time unnece&s;&s;ary, either to teize her to her duty, or to warn her again&s;t her follies, &s;he was even in perfect good humour with Mi&s;s Fenton, and added to the ho&s;pitality of a ho&s;t, the kindne&s;s of a friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Sandford, who came with lord Elmwood to the neighbouring &s;eat about a week after the arrival of Mi&s;s
<PB N="116" REF="124">
Milner at her's, was &s;o &s;crupulous ex|act in the ob&s;ervance of his word, "<HI>ne|ver to enter a hou&s;e of Mi&s;s Milner's,</HI>" that he would not even call upon his friend Dorriforth there&mdash;but in their walks, and at lord Elmwood's, the two parties would occa&s;ionally join, and of cour&s;e Sandford and &s;he at tho&s;e times met&mdash;yet &s;o di&s;tant was the re&s;erve on either &s;ide, that not a &s;ingle word was upon any occa&s;ion, ever exchanged be|tween them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner did not like Mr. Sand|ford; yet, as there was no real cau&s;e for inveterate rancour, admiring him too as a man who meant well, and be|ing be&s;ides of a mo&s;t forgiving temper, &s;he frequently felt concerned that he did not &s;peak to her, although it had been to find fault as u&s;ual&mdash;and one morning
<PB N="117" REF="125">
as they were all, after a long ramble, drawing towards her hou&s;e, where lord Elmwood was invited to dine, &s;he even bur&s;t into tears at &s;eeing Sandford turn back and wi&s;h them a "good day."</P>
<P>But though &s;he had genero&s;ity to forgive an affront, &s;he had not the hu|mility to make a conce&s;&s;ion; and &s;he fore&s;aw that nothing le&s;s than &s;ome very humble atonement on her part, would prevail upon the haughty prie&s;t to be reconciled. Dorriforth &s;aw her concern upon this trifling occa&s;ion with a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, and an admiration &s;he had never before excited. She in&s;inuated to him to be a mediator between them; but before any accommodation could take place, the peace and compo&s;ure of their abode was di&s;turbed by the arrival
<PB N="118" REF="126">
of Sir Edward A&s;hton at lord Elm|wood's, where it appeared as if he had been invited in order to pur&s;ue his ma|trimonial plan.</P>
<P>At a dinner at lord Elmwood's Sir Edward was announced as an unex|pected vi&s;iter; Mi&s;s Milner did not &s;uppo&s;e him &s;uch, and turned pale when his name was uttered&mdash;Dorriforth fixed his eyes upon her with &s;ome tokens of compa&s;&s;ion, while Sandford &s;eemed to exult, and by his repeated "Wel|comes" to the baronet, gave evident proofs how much he was rejoiced to &s;ee him. All the declining enmity of Mi&s;s Milner was renewed at this behaviour, and &s;u&s;pecting Sandford to be the in&s;ti|gator of his vi&s;it, &s;he could not over|come her di&s;plea&s;ure, but gave way to it in a manner &s;he thought the mo&s;t
<PB N="119" REF="127">
mortifying.&mdash;Sir Edward in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, enquired "what neigh|bours were in the country;" and &s;he with the highe&s;t appearance of &s;atisfac|tion, named lord Frederick Lawnly, as one who was hourly expected at his uncle's. The colour &s;pread over Sir Edward's face&mdash;Dorriforth looked con|founded&mdash;and Mr. Sandford as if he could have &s;truck her.</P>
<P>"Did lord Frederick tell <HI>you</HI> he &s;hould be down?" Sandford a&s;ked of Dorriforth.</P>
<P>To which he replied, "No."</P>
<P>"But I hope, Mr. Sandford, you will permit me to know?" cried Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;For as &s;he now meant to tor|ment him by what &s;he &s;aid, &s;he no longer con&s;trained her&s;elf to &s;ilence&mdash; and as he harboured the &s;ame kind in|tent towards her, he had no longer any
<PB N="120" REF="128">
objection to make a reply, and there|fore an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"No, madam, if it depended upon my permi&s;&s;ion, you &s;hould <HI>not</HI> know."</P>
<P>"Not <HI>any thing,</HI> Sir, I dare &s;ay;&mdash; you would keep me in utter igno|rance."</P>
<P>"I would."</P>
<P>"From a &s;elf-intere&s;ted motive, Mr. Sandford&mdash;that I might have a greater re&s;pect for you."</P>
<P>Some of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent laughed &mdash;Mrs. Horton coughed&mdash;Mi&s;s Wood|ley blu&s;hed&mdash;lord Elmwood &s;neered&mdash; Dorriforth frowned&mdash;and Mi&s;s Fenton, looked ju&s;t as &s;he did before.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was changed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and early in the even|ing the company returned home.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="129">Mi&s;s Milner had &s;carce left her dre&s;|&s;ing room, where &s;he had been taking off &s;ome part of her dre&s;s, when Dor|riforth's &s;ervant came to acquaint her his ma&s;ter was alone in his &s;tudy, and begged to &s;peak with her.&mdash;She felt her&s;elf tremble&mdash;&s;he immediately expe|rienced a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s &s;he had not acted properly at lord Elmwood's; for &s;he had a pre&s;cience her guardian was go|ing to upbraid her, and her heart told her, he had never yet reproached her without a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley ju&s;t then entered the apartment, and &s;he even found her&s;elf &s;o much a coward, as to propo&s;e her go|ing to Dorriforth along with her, and aiding her with a word or two occa|&s;ionally in her excu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="130">"What you, my dear," returned Mi&s;s Woodley, "who not two hours ago, had the courage to vindicate your own cau&s;e before a whole company, of whom many were your adver&s;aries; do you want an advocate before your guar|dian only? and he, who has ever treated you with tenderne&s;s."</P>
<P>"It is that tenderne&s;s which frightens me, Mi&s;s Woodley; that intimidates, and &s;trikes me dumb&mdash;is it po&s;&s;ible I can return impertinence to the language and manners Mr. Dorriforth u&s;es? and as I am debarred from that, what can I do but &s;tand before him like a guilty creature, acknowledging my faults."</P>
<P>She again entreated Mi&s;s Woodley to go with her, but on a po&s;itive refu|&s;al, from the impropriety of &s;uch an intru&s;ion, &s;he was at length obliged to go by her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="131">How much do different circum&s;tances influence not only the manners, but even the per&s;ons of &s;ome people!&mdash;Mi&s;s Mil|ner in the drawing room at lord Elm|wood's &s;urrounded by li&s;teners, by ad|mirers, (for even her enemies beheld her with admiration,) and warm with their approbation and applau&s;e &mdash; and Mi&s;s Milner, with no giddy ob&s;erver to give a fal&s;e eclat to her actions, left de&s;titute of all but her own under&s;tand|ing, (which &s;ecretly condemns her,) and upon the point of receiving the cen&s;ure of her guardian and friend, are two different beings.&mdash;Though &s;till beauti|ful beyond de&s;cription, &s;he does not look even in per&s;on the &s;ame.&mdash;In the la&s;t mentioned &s;ituation, &s;he was &s;horter in &s;tature than in the former&mdash;&s;he was paler &mdash; &s;he was thinner &mdash; and a very
<PB N="124" REF="132">
different contour pre&s;ided over her whole air, and all her features.</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived at the &s;tudy door, &s;he opened it with a trepidation &s;he could hardly account for, and entered to Dorriforth the altered woman &s;he has been repre&s;ented. His heart had taken the mo&s;t decided part again&s;t her, and his face a&s;&s;umed the mo&s;t &s;evere a&s;|pect of reproach; when her appearance gave an in&s;tantaneous change to <HI>his</HI> whole mind, and countenance.</P>
<P>She halted, as if &s;he feared to ap|proach&mdash;he he&s;itated, as if he knew not how to &s;peak. &mdash; In&s;tead of the warmth with which he was prepared to begin, his voice involuntarily &s;oftened, and without knowing what he &s;aid, he began,</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="133">"My dear Mi&s;s Milner"&mdash;</P>
<P>She expected he was angry, and in her confu&s;ion his gentlene&s;s was lo&s;t upon her&mdash;&s;he imagined what he &s;aid might be &s;evere, and &s;he continued to tremble, although he repeatedly a&s;&s;ured her, he meant only to advi&s;e, not to upbraid her.</P>
<P>"For in re&s;pect to all tho&s;e little di&s;putes between Mr. Sandford and you," &s;aid he, "I &s;hould be partial if I blamed you more than him&mdash; indeed, when you take the liberty to cen&s;ure him, his character makes the freedom appear in a more &s;erious light than when he complains of you&mdash;yet, if he provokes your retorts, he alone mu&s;t an&s;wer for them; nor will I undertake to decide betwixt you.&mdash;But I have a que&s;tion to a&s;k you, and to which I re|quire a &s;erious and unequivocal an&s;wer.
<PB N="126" REF="134">
&mdash;Do you expect lord Frederick in the country?"</P>
<P>Without he&s;itation &s;he replied, "&s;he did."</P>
<P>"I have one more que&s;tion to a&s;k, madam, and to which I expect a reply equally unre&s;erved.&mdash;Is lord Frederick the man you approve for a hu&s;band?"</P>
<P>Upon this clo&s;e interrogation &s;he di&s;|covered an embarra&s;&s;ment, and a confu|&s;ion beyond any &s;he had ever before given proofs of; and in this &s;ituation &s;he faintly replied,</P>
<P>"No, he is not."</P>
<P>"Your words tell me one thing," an&s;wered Dorriforth, "while your looks declare another&mdash;which am I to tru&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Which you plea&s;e." She returned with an in&s;ulted dignity, that a&s;toni&s;hed, awed, yet did not convince him.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="135">"But then why encourage him to fol|low you hither, Mi&s;s Milner?"</P>
<P>"Why commit a thou&s;and follies (&s;he replied in tears) every hour of my life?"</P>
<P>"You then promote the hopes of lord Frederick without one &s;erious in|tention of completing them? This is a conduct which it is my duty to guard you again&s;t, and you &s;hall no longer deceive either him or your&s;elf. The moment he arrives it is my fixed re&s;olu|tion you refu&s;e to &s;ee him, or agree to become his wife."</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, &s;he appeared aver&s;e both to the one propo&s;ition and the other, yet came to no explanation why; but left her guardian at the conclu&s;ion of the conver&s;ation as much at a lo&s;s to decide upon her real &s;entiments, as he was before he had thus &s;eriou&s;ly re|que&s;ted
<PB N="128" REF="136">
to be informed of them; but having &s;teadfa&s;tly taken the re&s;olution which he had declared to her, he found that determination a certain relief to his mind.</P>

<P>SIR Edward A&s;hton, though not in|vited by Mi&s;s Milner, yet frequently did him&s;elf the favour to come to her hou&s;e; &s;ometimes he accompanied lord Elmwood on a vi&s;it to her, at other times he came to &s;ee Dorriforth only, who generally introduced him to the ladies. But Sir Edward was either &s;o unwilling to give pain to the object of his love, or &s;o much intimidated by her frowns, that he &s;eldom addre&s;&s;ed a &s;in|gle word to her, except the common compliments at entering, and retiring. &mdash;This apprehen&s;ion of offending, with|out one hope of plea&s;ing, had the mo&s;t awkward effect upon the manners of

the worthy baronet, and his endeavours to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the affections of the woman he loved, merely by the means of not giving her offence either by &s;peaking or looking at her, was a circum&s;tance &s;o whim&s;ical, that it fre|quently forced a &s;mile from Mi&s;s Mil|ner, though the very name of Sir Ed|ward was of power to throw a gloom over her face; for &s;he looked upon him as the cau&s;e why &s;he &s;hould be hurried to make an election of a lover, before her own mind could well direct her where to fix.&mdash;Be&s;ides, his pur&s;uit was a trou|ble, while it was not the &s;malle&s;t tri|umph to her vanity, which by the ad|dre&s;&s;es of lord Frederick, was in the highe&s;t manner gratified.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip now arrives in the country, and calls at Mi&s;s Milner's;
<PB N="131" REF="139">
her guardian &s;ees his chariot coming along the lawn and gives orders to the &s;ervants, to &s;ay their lady is not at home, but that Mr. Dorriforth is; lord Frederick leaves his compliments and goes away.</P>
<P>The ladies all &s;aw his carriage and &s;ervants at the door; Mi&s;s Milner flew to the gla&s;s to adju&s;t her dre&s;s, and in her looks expre&s;&s;ed &s;igns of palpitation &mdash;but in vain &s;he keeps her eyes fixed upon the door of the apartment; he does not enter.</P>
<P>After &s;ome minutes expectation, the door opens and her guardian comes in; &s;he was di&s;appointed, he perceived &s;he was, and he looked at her with a very &s;erious face; &s;he immediately called to mind the a&s;&s;urance he had given her,
<PB N="132" REF="140">
"that her acquaintance with lord Fre|derick in its pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;hould not continue," and between chagrin and confu&s;ion, &s;he was at a lo&s;s how to be|have.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the ladies were all pre&s;ent, Dorriforth &s;aid to her, without the &s;malle&s;t re&s;erve, "Perhaps, Mi&s;s Milner, you may think I have taken an unwarrantable liberty in giving orders to your &s;ervants to deny you to lord Frederick, but until his lord&s;hip and I have had a private conference, or you conde&s;cend to declare your &s;entiments more fully in regard to his vi&s;its, I think it my duty to put an end to them."</P>
<P>"You will always perform your duty, Mr. Dorriforth, I have no doubt, whether I concur or not."</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="141">"Yet believe me, madam, I &s;hould do it much more chearfully, could I hope it was &s;cantioned by your inclina|tions."</P>
<P>"I am not mi&s;tre&s;s of my inclina|tions, Sir, or they &s;hould conform to yours."</P>
<P>"Place them under my direction, madam, and I'll an&s;wer they will."</P>
<P>A &s;ervant entered.&mdash;"Lord Frede|rick is returned, Sir, and &s;ays he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you."&mdash;"Shew him into the &s;tudy." Cried Dorriforth ha&s;tily, and ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, left the room.</P>
<P>"I hope they won't quarrel." Said Mrs. Horton, meaning, &s;he thought they would.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry to &s;ee you &s;o unea&s;y, Mi&s;s Milner." Said Mi&s;s Fenton, with the mo&s;t perfect unconcern.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="142">As the badne&s;s of the weather had prevented their u&s;ual morning's exerci&s;e, the ladies &s;at employed at their needles till the dinner bell called them away.&mdash; "Do you think lord Frederick is gone?" then, whi&s;pered Mi&s;s Milner to Mi&s;s Woodley. &mdash; "I think not," returned Mi&s;s Woodley. &mdash; "Go a&s;k of the &s;ervants, dear creature."

<P>"Ladies, the dinner is waiting," cried Mrs. Horton, and they repaired to the dining room; where Dorriforth &s;oon after came, and engro&s;&s;ed their whole attention by his di&s;turbed looks, and unu&s;ual &s;ilence. Before dinner was over he was, however, more him&s;elf,
<PB N="135" REF="143">
but &s;till he appeared thoughtful and di&s;|&s;atisfied. At the time of their evening walks he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and was &s;een in a di&s;tant field with Mr. Sandford in earne&s;t conver&s;ation; for they frequently &s;topt on one &s;pot for a quarter of an hour, as if the intere&s;t of the &s;ubject had &s;o totally engaged them, they &s;tood &s;till without knowing it. Lord Elm|wood, who had joined the ladies, walked home with them; Dorriforth entered &s;oon after, in a much le&s;s gloomy hu|mour than when he went out, and told his lord&s;hip he and the ladies would dine with him to-morrow if he was di&s;|engaged, and it was fixed they &s;hould.</P>
<P>Still Dorriforth was in &s;ome pertur|bation, but the immediate cau&s;e was concealed till the next day, when, about an hour before the company's depar|ture
<PB N="136" REF="144">
from the Ca&s;tle, Mi&s;s Milner and Mi&s;s Woodley were de&s;ired, by a &s;er|vant, to walk into a &s;eparate apart|ment, where they found Dorriforth with Mr. Sandford waiting their coming. Her guardian made an apology to Mi&s;s Milner for the form, the cere|mony, of which he was going to make u&s;e; but he tru&s;ted, the extreme weight with which his mind was oppre&s;&s;ed, le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;take the real &s;entiments of a lady who&s;e happine&s;s depended upon his being correct in the knowledge of them, he tru&s;ted, that would plead his excu&s;e.</P>
<P>"I know, Mi&s;s Milner," continued he, "the world in general, allows to unmarried women great latitude in di&s;|gui&s;ing their mind with re&s;pect to the man they love.&mdash;I too, am willing to pardon any little di&s;&s;imulation that is
<PB N="137" REF="145">
but con&s;i&s;tent with that mode&s;ty, be|coming every woman on the &s;ubject of marriage. But to what point I may limit, or you may think proper to ex|tend this kind of venial deceit, may &s;o widely differ, that it is not impo&s;&s;ible I remain wholly unacquainted with your &s;entiments, even after you have revealed them to me.&mdash;Under this con&s;ideration, I wi&s;h once more to hear your thoughts in regard to matrimony, and to hear them before one of your own &s;ex, that I may be enabled to form my opinion by her con&s;tructions."</P>
<P>To all this &s;erious oration, Mi&s;s Mil|ner made no other reply than by turn|ing to Mr. Sandford, and a&s;king, "If he was the per&s;on of her own &s;ex, to who&s;e judgment her guardian meant to &s;ubmit his own?"</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="146">"Madam," cried Sandford very an|grily, "you are come hither upon &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"Any bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be &s;erious to me, Mr. Sandford, in which you are concerned; and if you had called it <HI>&s;orrowful,</HI> the epithet would have &s;uited as well."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid her guardian, "I did not bring you here to contend with Mr. Sandford."</P>
<P>"Then why, Sir, bring him hither? for where he and I are, there mu&s;t be contention."</P>
<P>"I brought him hither, madam, or rather brought you to this hou&s;e, merely that he might be pre&s;ent on this occa|&s;ion, and with his di&s;cernment relieve me from a &s;u&s;picion, that my own judgment can neither &s;uppre&s;s or con|firm."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="147">"Is there any more company you may wi&s;h to call in, Sir, to clear up your doubts of my veracity? if &s;o, pray &s;end for them before you begin your interrogations."</P>
<P>He &s;hook his head&mdash;&s;he continued. "The whole world is welcome to hear what I &s;ay, and every different judge welcome, if they plea&s;e, to judge me differently."</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;," cried Mi&s;s Woodley, with a tone of reproach for the vehemence with which &s;he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"Perhaps, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Dor|riforth, "you will not now, reply to tho&s;e que&s;tions I was going to put to you?"</P>
<P>"Did I ever refu&s;e, Sir," returned &s;he with a &s;elf-approving air, "to com|ply with any reque&s;t you have &s;eriou&s;ly made me? Have I ever refu&s;ed to obey
<PB N="140" REF="148">
your commands whenever you thought proper to lay them upon me? if not, you have no right to &s;uppo&s;e I will now."</P>
<P>He was going to reply, when Mr. Sandford &s;ullenly interrupted him, and making towards the door, cried, "When you come to the point for which you brought me here, &s;end for me again."</P>
<P>"Stay now," cried Dorriforth. "And Mi&s;s Milner," continued he, "I not only entreat, but command you to tell me.&mdash;Have you given your promi&s;es, your word, or your affections to lord Frederick Lawnley?"</P>
<P>The colour &s;pread over her face, and &s;he replied &mdash; "I thought confe&s;&s;ions were only permitted in &s;ecrecy; how|ever, as I am not a member of your church, I &s;ubmit to the per&s;ecution of a heretick, and an&s;wer &mdash; Lord Fre|derick
<PB N="141" REF="149">
has neither my word, my pro|mi&s;e, nor any &s;hare in my affections."</P>
<P>Sandford, Dorriforth, and Mi&s;s Woodley all looked at each other with a &s;urpri&s;e that was for &s;ome time dumb. &mdash; At length Dorriforth &s;aid, "And it is your firm intention never to become his wife?"</P>

<P>"At pre&s;ent! do you &s;u&s;pect you &s;hall change your &s;entiments?"</P>
<P>"Women, &s;ometimes do."</P>
<P>"But before that change can take place, madam, your acquaintance will be broken off: for it is that, I &s;hall next in&s;i&s;t upon; and to which you can have no objection."</P>
<P>She replied, "I had rather it would continue."</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="150">"On what account?" cried Dorri|forth.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e it entertains me."</P>
<P>"For &s;hame, for &s;hame!" returned he, "it endangers both your character and your happine&s;s.&mdash;Yet again, do not &s;uffer me to break with his lord&s;hip if &s;hould like to become his wife; if in that re&s;pect it militates again&s;t your felicity?"</P>
<P>"By no means," &s;he an&s;wered; "lord Frederick makes part of my amu&s;ement, but could never con&s;titute my felicity."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Woodley," &s;aid Dorriforth, "do you comprehend your friend in the &s;ame literal and unequivocal &s;en&s;e I do?"</P>

<P>"Do not you then, Mr. Sandford?" a&s;ked Dorriforth.</P>
<P>"I would advi&s;e you to act the &s;ame as if I did." Replied Sandford.</P>
<P>"Then, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Dorri|forth, "you &s;ee lord Frederick no more&mdash;and I hope I have your permi&s;|&s;ion to tell him &s;o?"</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="152">"You have, Sir." She replied with a completely unembarra&s;&s;ed counte|nance and voice.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley looked hard at her, to di&s;cover &s;ome lurking wi&s;h adver&s;e to all the&s;e prote&s;tations, but &s;he could not di&s;cern one. &mdash; Sandford too fixed his penetrating eyes as if he would look through her &s;oul, but finding it per|fectly compo&s;ed, he cried out,</P>
<P>"Why then not write his lord&s;hip's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion her&s;elf, and &s;ave you, Mr. Dorriforth, the trouble of any farther conte&s;t with him?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Mi&s;s Milner," &s;aid Dorri|forth, "that would oblige me; for it is with the greate&s;t reluctance I meet his lord&s;hip upon this &s;ubject&mdash;he was extremely impatient and importunate the la&s;t time he was with me&mdash;he took advantage of my eccle&s;ia&s;tic &s;ituation
<PB N="145" REF="153">
to treat me with a levity, and ill-breed|ing, I could ill have &s;uffered upon any other con&s;ideration, than the complying with my duty to you."</P>
<P>"Dictate what you plea&s;e, Mr. Dor|riforth, and I will write it." Said &s;he with a warmth like the mo&s;t unaffected inclination.&mdash;"And while you, Sir," &s;he continued, "are &s;o indulgent as not to di&s;tre&s;s me with the importunities of any gentleman to whom I am aver&s;e, I think my&s;elf equally bound to rid you of the impertinence of every one, to whom you may have objection."</P>
<P>"But," an&s;wered he, "be a&s;&s;ured I have no material objection to my lord Frederick, except from that dilemma, into which your acquaintance with him has involved us all; and the &s;ame I &s;hould conceive again&s;t any other man, where the &s;ame circum&s;tance occurred.&mdash;
<PB N="146" REF="154">
As you have now, however, freely and politely con&s;ented to the manner in which it has been propo&s;ed, you &s;hall break with him, I will not trouble you a moment longer upon a &s;ubject on which I have &s;o frequently explained my wi&s;hes, but conclude it by a&s;&s;uring you, your ready acquie&s;cence has given me the &s;incere&s;t &s;atisfaction."</P>
<P>"I hope, Mr. Sandford," &s;aid &s;he, turning to him with a &s;mile, "I have given you &s;atisfaction likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>Sandford could not &s;ay yes, and was a&s;hamed to &s;ay no; he, therefore, made no an&s;wer except by his looks, which were full of &s;u&s;picion. She, notwith|&s;tanding, made him a very low courte&s;y. &mdash;Her guardian then handed her out of the apartment into her coach, which was waiting to take her, Mi&s;s Woodley, and him&s;elf home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming readi|ne&s;s with which Mi&s;s Milner had re|&s;igned all farther acquaintance with lord Frederick, during the &s;hort ride home &s;he appeared to have lo&s;t great part of her wonted &s;pirits; &s;he was thoughtful, and once &s;ighed mo&s;t heavily. Dor|riforth began to fear &s;he had not only made a &s;acrifice of her affections, but of her varacity; yet, why &s;he had done &s;o, he could not comprehend.</P>
<P>As the carriage moved &s;lowly thro' a lane between Elmwood Ca&s;tle and her hou&s;e, on ca&s;ting her eyes out of the window, Mi&s;s Milner's countenance was brightened in an in|&s;tant, and that in&s;tant lord Frederick
<PB N="148" REF="156">
on hor&s;e-back was at the coach door, and the coachman &s;topt.</P>
<P>"Oh, Mi&s;s Milner," cried he, (with a voice and manner that could give little &s;u&s;picion of the truth of what he &s;aid) "I am over-joyed at the happi|ne&s;s of &s;eeing you, even though it is but an accidental meeting."</P>
<P>She was evidently glad to &s;ee him, but the earne&s;tne&s;s with which he &s;poke, put her upon her guard not to expre&s;s the like, and &s;he &s;aid in a cool con&s;trained manner, &s;he "was glad to &s;ee his lord&s;hip."</P>
<P>The re&s;erve with which &s;he &s;poke, gave lord Frederick immediate &s;u&s;|picion who was in the coach with her, and turning his head quickly, he met the &s;tern eye of Dorriforth; upon which, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;alutation,
<PB N="149" REF="157">
he turned from him again abruptly and rudely. Mi&s;s Milner was confu&s;ed, and Mi&s;s Woodley in torture at the palbable affront; to which Dorriforth alone appeared indifferent.</P>
<P>"Go on," &s;aid Mi&s;s Milner to the footman, "de&s;ire the coachman to drive on."</P>
<P>"No," cried lord Frederick, "not till you have told me when I &s;hall &s;ee you again."</P>
<P>"I will write you word, my lord." Replied &s;he, &s;omething alarmed; "You &s;hall have a letter immediately after I get home."</P>
<P>As if he gue&s;&s;ed what its contents were to be, he cried out with warmth, "Take care then, madam, how you treat me in that letter&mdash;and you, Mr. Dorriforth," turning to him, "do you take care what it contains, for if it is
<PB N="150" REF="158">
dictated by you, to you I &s;hall &s;end the an&s;wer."</P>
<P>Dorriforth, without making his lord|&s;hip a reply, or ca&s;ting a look at him, put his head out of the window on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and called, in a very angry tone to the coachman, "How dare you not drive on, when your lady orders you?</P>
<P>The &s;ound of Dorriforth's voice in anger was to the &s;ervants &s;o unu&s;ual, it acted like a &s;troke of electricity on the man, and he drove on at the in|&s;tant &s;o &s;wiftly, that lord Frederick was in a moment left many yards be|hind. As &s;oon, however, as he re|covered from the &s;urpri&s;e into which this &s;udden command had thrown him, he rode with &s;peed after the carriage, and followed it till they all arrived at the door of Mi&s;s Milner's hou&s;e; there

his lord&s;hip, giving him&s;elf up to the rage of love, or to rage again&s;t Dor|riforth for the contempt with which he had treated him, leapt from his hor&s;e as Mi&s;s Milner &s;tept from her carriage, and &s;eizing her hand, entreated her "Not to de&s;ert him, in compliance to the mona&s;tick precepts of hypocri&s;y."</P>
<P>Dorriforth heard this, &s;tanding &s;ilent|ly by, with a manly &s;corn painted on his countenance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner &s;truggled to loo&s;e her hand, &s;aying, "Excu&s;e me from reply|ing to you now, my lord."</P>
<P>In return to which his lord&s;hip brought her hand to his lips, and be|gan to devour it with ki&s;&s;es, when Dorriforth with an in&s;tantaneous im|pul&s;e, ru&s;hed forward, and &s;truck him a blow in the face.&mdash;Under the force with which this a&s;&s;ault was given, and the
<PB N="152" REF="160">
a&s;toni&s;hment it excited, his lord&s;hip &s;taggered, and letting fall the hand of Mi&s;s Milner, her guardian immediately laid hold of it, and led her into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was terrified beyond de&s;cription; and it was with difficulty Mr. Dorri|forth could get her to her own cham|ber, without taking her in his arms.&mdash; When, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her woman, he had placed her upon a &s;opha&mdash;all &s;hame and confu&s;ion for what he had done, he dropped upon his knees be|fore her, and earne&s;tly "entreated her forgivene&s;s for the indelicacy he had been guilty of in her pre&s;ence."&mdash;And that he had alarmed her, and lo&s;t &s;ight of the re&s;pect which he thought &s;acredly her due, &s;eemed to be the only circum&s;tance that dwelt upon his thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="161">She felt the indecorum of the po&s;|ture he had conde&s;cended to take, and was &s;hocked &mdash; to &s;ee her guardian at her feet, &s;truck her with the &s;ame im|propriety as if &s;he had beheld a parent there; and all agitation and emotion, &s;he implored him to ri&s;e, and with a thou&s;and prote&s;tations declared, "&s;he thought the ra&s;hne&s;s of the act, was the highe&s;t proof of his regard for her."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley now entered; for her care being ever employed upon the unfortunate, lord Frederick on this occa&s;ion, had been the object of it; and &s;he had waited by his &s;ide, and with every good purpo&s;e, preached patience to him, while he was &s;marting under the pain and &s;hame of his cha&s;|ti&s;ement.&mdash;At fir&s;t, his fury threatened
<PB N="154" REF="162">
to retort upon the &s;ervants around him, and who refu&s;ed his entrance into the hou&s;e, the puni&s;hment he had re|ceived &mdash; But in the certainty of an honourable amends which mu&s;t here|after be made, he overcame the many temptations which the moment offered, and remounting his hor&s;e, rode from the place.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Mi&s;s Woodley en|tered the room, and Dorriforth had re&s;igned to her the care of his ward, than he flew to the &s;pot where he had left his lord&s;hip, negligent what might have been the event had he &s;till re|mained there.&mdash;After enquiring, and being told he was gone, Dorriforth returned to his own apartment; and with a bo&s;om torn by more excruciat|ing
<PB N="155" REF="163">
&s;en&s;ations far, than tho&s;e he had given to his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>The remor&s;e that fir&s;t &s;truck him as he &s;hut the door upon him&s;elf was &mdash; I have departed from my character &mdash; from the &s;acred character, and dig|nity of my profe&s;&s;ion and &s;entiments &mdash; I have departed from my&s;elf.&mdash; I am no longer the philo&s;opher, but the ruffian&mdash;I have treated with an un|pardonable in&s;ult a young nobleman, who&s;e only crime was love, and a fond de&s;ire to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the favour of his mi&s;tre&s;s. &mdash; I mu&s;t atone for this outrage in whatever manner he may choo&s;e, and the law of ju&s;tice and equity (though in this one in&s;tance, contrary to the law of religion) enjoins, that if he demands my life, in &s;atisfaction for his wound|ed

<P>He next reflected &mdash; I have offended, and filled with horror a beautiful young lady, whom it was my duty to have protected from the brutal manners, to which I my&s;elf have expo&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;I have drawn upon me the ju&s;t reproaches of my faithful precep|tor and friend; the man in who&s;e judg|ment it was my delight to be ap|proved &mdash; above all, I have drawn upon my&s;elf, the &s;tings of my own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>"Where &s;hall I pa&s;s this &s;leeple&s;s night?" cried he, walking repeatedly acro&s;s his chamber; "Can I go to the

<P>ALTHOUGH Mi&s;s Milner had fore&s;een no fatal event from the indig|nity offered lord Frederick, yet &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a night very different from tho&s;e to which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed. No &s;ooner was &s;he falling into a &s;leep, than a thou&s;and vague, but di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ideas darted acro&s;s her imagination.&mdash; Her heart would at times whi&s;per to her as &s;he was half a&s;leep, "lord Fre|derick is bani&s;hed from you for ever." &mdash;She &s;hakes off the unea&s;ine&s;s this idea brings along with it&mdash;&s;he then &s;tarts, and beholds the blow &s;till aimed at him by Dorriforth.&mdash;And no &s;ooner has &s;he driven away this painful image, than &s;he is again awakened by &s;eeing her
<PB N="159" REF="169">
guardian at her feet &s;uing for pardon.&mdash; She &s;ighs, &s;he trembles, &s;he is chilled with terror.</P>
<P>Relieved by a flood of tears; to|wards the morning &s;he &s;inks into a re|fre&s;hing &s;lumber, but waking, finds the &s;elf-&s;ame images crowding all together upon her mind &mdash; &s;he is doubtful to which to give the preference &mdash; one, however, ru&s;hes the foremo&s;t, and will continue &s;o&mdash;&s;he knows not the con&s;e|quence of ruminating, nor why &s;he dwells upon that, more than upon all the re&s;t, and yet it will give place to none.</P>
<P>She ri&s;es in a languid and di&s;ordered &s;tate, and at breakfa&s;t adds fre&s;h pain to Dorriforth by her altered appear|ance.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="170">He had &s;carce left the breakfa&s;t room when an officer waited upon him charged with a challenge from lord Frederick. To the me&s;&s;age delivered to him by this gentleman, Dorriforth replied,</P>
<P>"As a clergyman, more e&s;pecially in the church of Rome, I know not whether I am not exempt from an|&s;wering a claim of this kind; but not having had forbearance to avoid an of|fence, I have no right to a privilege that would only indemnify me from making reparation."</P>
<P>"You will then meet his lord&s;hip, Sir, at the appointed time?" Said the officer.</P>
<P>"I will," an&s;wered Dorriforth, "and my immediate care &s;hall be to procure a gentleman to accompany me."</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="171">The officer withdrew, and as &s;oon as Dorriforth was once more alone, he was going once more to reflect, but he dur&s;t not &mdash; &s;ince ye&s;terday, re|flection, for the fir&s;t time of his life, was become painful to him; and even as he rode the &s;hort way to lord Elmwood's immediately after, he found his own thoughts &s;o in&s;ufferable, he was obliged to enter into conver&s;ation with his &s;ervant. Solitude, that he was formerly &s;o charmed withal, at tho&s;e moments had been wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>At lord Elmwood's, he met Sand|ford in the hall, and the &s;ight of him was no longer welcome, but di&s;plea&s;|ing &mdash; he knew how different the prin|ciples he had ju&s;t adopted were to tho&s;e of that reverend friend's, and without
<PB N="162" REF="172">
his complaining, or even &s;u&s;pecting what had happened, his pre&s;ence was a &s;ufficient reproach. &mdash; Dorriforth pa&s;&s;ed him as ha&s;tily as he could, and en|quiring for lord Elmwood, di&s;clo&s;ed to him his errand, which was to a&s;k him to be his &s;econd; his lord&s;hip &s;tarted, and wi&s;hed to con&s;ult his tu|tor, but that his kin&s;man &s;trictly for|bid; and having urged his rea&s;ons with arguments, &s;uch as his lord&s;hip could not refute; he at length pre|vailed upon him to promi&s;e he would accompany him to the field, which was at a few miles di&s;tance only, and the parties were to be there at &s;even on the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as his bu&s;ine&s;s with lord Elmwood was &s;ettled, Dorriforth re|turned home, to make &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary preparations for the event which might
<PB N="163" REF="173">
en&s;ue from this meeting &mdash; he wrote letters to &s;everal of his friends; and one to his ward, over which he &s;hed tears.</P>
<P>Sandford going into lord Elmwood's library &s;oon after Dorriforth had left it, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e at finding him gone; upon which that young nobleman, after an&s;wering a few que&s;|tions, and giving a few &s;ignificant tokens, that he was entru&s;ted with a &s;ecret, frankly confe&s;&s;ed, what he had promi&s;ed to conceal.</P>
<P>Sandford, as much as a holy man could be, was enraged at Dorriforth for the cau&s;e of this challenge, but was &s;till more enraged at him for his wickedne&s;s in accepting it &mdash; he ap|plauded his pupil's virtue in making
<PB N="164" REF="174">
the di&s;covery, and congratulated him|&s;elf that he &s;hould be the in&s;trument, of &s;aving not only the blood of his friend, but of preventing the &s;candal of his being engaged in a duel.</P>
<P>In the ardour of his de&s;igns he went immediately to Mi&s;s Milner's &mdash; en|tered the hou&s;e he had &s;o long refu&s;ed to enter, and at a time when he was on aggravated bad terms with its owner.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked for Dorriforth, went ha&s;tily into his apartment, and poured upon him a torrent of rebukes. &mdash; Dorriforth bore all he &s;aid with the patience of a devotee, but with the firmne&s;s of a man. &mdash; He owned his fault, but no eloquence could make him recall the promi&s;e he had given to repair the injury. &mdash; Un&s;haken by the arguments,
<PB N="165" REF="175">
per&s;ua&s;ions, and menaces of Sandford, he gave a fre&s;h proof of that inflex|ibility for which he has been de&s;cribed &mdash; and after two hours di&s;pute they parted, neither of them the better for what either had advanced, but Dorri|forth &s;omething the wor&s;e; his con|&s;cience gave te&s;timony to Sandford's opinion, "that he was bound by ties more &s;acred than worldly honour," but while he owned, he would not yield to the duty.</P>
<P>Sandford left him, determined, how|ever, that lord Elmwood &s;hould not be acce&s;&s;ary in his guilt, and this he de|clared, on which Dorriforth took the re&s;olution of &s;eeking another &s;econd.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through the hou&s;e on his return home, Sandford met, by acci|dent,
<PB N="166" REF="176">
Mrs. Horton, Mi&s;s Milner, and the other two ladies returning from a &s;aun|ter in the garden.&mdash;Surpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of Mr. Sandford in her hou&s;e, Mi&s;s Milner would not expre&s;s that &s;urpri&s;e, but going up to him with all the friend|ly benevolence which generally played about her heart, &s;he took hold of one of his hands, and pre&s;&s;ed it with a kind|ne&s;s which told him he was welcome more forcibly, than if &s;he had made the mo&s;t elaborate &s;peech to convince him of it. &mdash; He, however, &s;eemed little touched with her behaviour, and as an excu&s;e for breaking his word, cried,</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, madam, but I was brought hither in my anxiety to prevent murder."</P>
<P>"Murder!" Exclaimed all the la|dies.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="177">"Yes," an&s;wered he, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to Mi&s;s Fenton, "your betrothed hu&s;band is a party concerned; he is going to be &s;econd to Mr. Dorriforth, who means this very evening to be killed by my lord Frederick, or to kill him, in addition to the blow he gave him la&s;t night."</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton exclaimed, "If Mr. Dorriforth dies, he dies a martyr."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley cried with fervour, "Heaven forbid!"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fenton cried, "Dear me!"</P>
<P>While Mi&s;s Milner, without uttering one word, &s;unk &s;peechle&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>They lifted her up and brought her to the door which entered the garden. She &s;oon recovered; for the tumult of her mind would not &s;uffer her to re|main inactive, and &s;he was rouzed, in &s;pite of her weakne&s;s, to endeavour to
<PB N="168" REF="178">
ward off the pre&s;ent di&s;a&s;ter.&mdash;In vain, however, &s;he tried to walk to Dorri|forth's apartment&mdash;in the trial &s;he &s;unk as before, and was taken to a &s;ettee, while Mi&s;s Woodley was di&s;patched to bring her guardian to her.</P>
<P>Informed of the cau&s;e of her &s;woon|ings, he followed Mi&s;s Woodley with a tender anxiety for her health, and with grief and confu&s;ion that he had &s;o care|le&s;sly endangered it.&mdash;On his entering the room Sandford beheld the inquie|tude of his mind, and cried, "here is your <HI>guardian,</HI>" with a cruel empha&s;is on the word.</P>
<P>He was too much engaged by the indi&s;po&s;ition of his ward to reply to Sandford.&mdash;He placed him&s;elf on the &s;ettee by her, and with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s, reverence, and pity, entreated
<PB N="169" REF="179">
her not to be concerned at an accident in which he, and he only, had been to blame; but which he had &s;till no doubt would be accommodated in the mo&s;t amicable manner.</P>
<P>"I have one favour to require of you, Mr. Dorriforth," &s;aid &s;he, "and that is your promi&s;e, your &s;olemn promi&s;e, which I know is &s;acred, that you will not fight with my lord Frederick."</P>
<P>He he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"Oh, madam," cried Sandford, "he is grown a libertine now, and I would not believe his word were he to give it you."</P>
<P>"Then, Sir," returned Dorriforth angrily, "you <HI>may</HI> believe my word, for I will keep that, I have pa&s;&s;ed to you. &mdash;I will give lord Frederick all the re&s;ti|tution in my power.&mdash;But my dear Mi&s;s Milner, let not this alarm you; we

may not find it convenient to meet this many a day; and mo&s;t probably &s;ome fortunate explanation may yet take place and prevent our meeting at all. If not, reckon but among the many duels that are fought, how few are fa|tal; and even in that ca&s;e, how &s;mall would be the lo&s;s to &s;ociety"&mdash;He was proceeding.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould ever deplore the lo&s;s," cried Mi&s;s Milner, "I could not &s;ur|vive the death of either, in &s;uch a ca&s;e."</P>
<P>"For my part," returned Dorriforth, "I look upon my life as much forfeited to his lord&s;hip, to whom I have given a high offence, as it might in other in&s;tances have been forfeited to the offended laws of the land. Honour, is the law of the polite part of the land; we know it; and when we tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t it know|ingly, we ju&s;tly incur our puni&s;hment.
<PB N="171" REF="181">
&mdash;However, Mi&s;s Milner, this bu&s;ine&s;s is not to be &s;ettled immediately, and I have no doubt but all will be as you could wi&s;h.&mdash;Do you think I &s;hould appear thus ea&s;y," added he with a &s;mile, "if I were going to be &s;hot at by my lord Frederick?"</P>
<P>"Very well." Cried Sandford, with a look that demon&s;trated he knew better."</P>
<P>"You will &s;tay within then, all this day?" Said Mi&s;s Milner.</P>
<P>"I am engaged out to dinner," he replied, "it is unlucky&mdash;I am &s;orry for it&mdash;but I'll be at home early in the evening."</P>
<P>"Stained with human blood," cried Sandford, "or your&s;elf a corp&s;e."</P>
<P>The ladies all lifted up their hands, and Mi&s;s Milner ro&s;e from her &s;eat and threw her&s;elf at her guardian's feet.</P>

<P>"I own," &s;aid Dorriforth, (&s;truck with amaze, and now taking her from his feet with a force &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t) "I own, Mi&s;s Milner, I am greatly affected at this contradiction in your character"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But did not I &s;ay &s;o?" cried Sand|ford, interrupting him.</P>
<P>"However," continued he, "you may take my word, though you have deceived me in your's, that

lord Frederick's life is &s;ecure. &mdash; For your &s;ake, I would not endanger it for the univer&s;e.&mdash;But let this be a warn|ing to you"&mdash;</P>

<P>"Let this be a warning to you, how you deal in future with the friends who wi&s;h you well&mdash;you have hurried me into a mi&s;take that might have co&s;t me my life, or the life of the man you love; and thus expo&s;ed <HI>you</HI> to mi&s;ery, more bitter than death."</P>
<P>"I am not worthy your friend&s;hip, Mr. Dorriforth," &s;aid &s;he, &s;obbing with

grief, "and from this moment for&s;ake me."</P>
<P>"No, madam, not in the moment you fir&s;t di&s;cover to me, how I can make you happy."</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation appearing now to become of that nature in which the re&s;t of the company could have no &s;hare whatever; they all, except Mr. Sand|ford, were retiring; when Mi&s;s Milner called Mi&s;s Woodley back, &s;aying, "Stay you with me; I was never &s;o unfit to be left without your friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Perhaps for the pre&s;ent you can much ea&s;ier di&s;pen&s;e with mine?" &s;aid Dorriforth. She made no an&s;wer: he therefore having once more a&s;&s;ured her lord Frederick's life was &s;afe, was quit|ting the room; when he recollected in what a &s;tate of humiliation he had left

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>THIS taunting reproof from Sand|ford made little impre&s;&s;ion upon Mi&s;s Milner, who&s;e thoughts were all fixed on a &s;ubject of much more importance than the opinion he entertained of her. &mdash; She threw her arms about Mi&s;s Woodley as &s;oon as they were left alone, and a&s;ked, with anxiety, "What &s;he thought of her behaviour?" Mi&s;s Woodley, who could not approve of the duplicity her friend had betrayed, &s;till wi&s;hed to reconcile her as much as po&s;&s;ible to her own conduct, and re|plied, &s;he "highly commended the frankne&s;s with which &s;he had, at la&s;t, acknowledged her &s;entiments."</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="188">"Frankne&s;s!" cried Mi&s;s Milner, &s;tarting. "Frankne&s;s, my dear Mi&s;s Woodley! &mdash; what you have ju&s;t now heard me &s;ay, is all a fal&s;ehood."</P>
<P>"How, Mi&s;s Milner!"</P>
<P>"Oh, my dear Mi&s;s Woodley," re|turned &s;he, &s;obbing upon her bo&s;om, "pity the agonies of my heart, by na|ture &s;incere, when &s;uch are the fatal propen&s;ities it cheri&s;hes, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehoods rather than re|veal the truth."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" Cried Mi&s;s Woodley, with the &s;tronge&s;t amazement painted on her face.</P>
<P>"Do you &s;uppo&s;e I love lord Fre|derick?" Returned the other. "Do you &s;uppo&s;e I <HI>can</HI> love him?&mdash;Oh fly, Mi&s;s Woodley, and prevent my guar|dian from telling him &s;uch an un|truth."</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="189">"What do you mean?" repeated Mi&s;s Woodley; "I prote&s;t you frighten me:"&mdash;and this incon&s;i&s;tency in the be|haviour of Mi&s;s Milner, really appeared as if her &s;en&s;es had been deranged.</P>
<P>"Only fly," re&s;umed &s;he, "and pre|vent the inevitable ill con&s;equence which mu&s;t en&s;ue from lord Frederick's being told this fal&s;ehood.&mdash;It will in|volve us all in greater di&s;quietude than we &s;uffer at pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>"Then what has influenced you, my dear Mi&s;s Milner?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"That which impels my every ac|tion." Returned &s;he; "An un&s;urmount|able in&s;tinct&mdash;a fatality, that will ever render me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of human beings; and yet you, even you, my dear Mi&s;s Woodley, will not pity me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley pre&s;&s;ed her clo&s;e in her arms, and vowed, "That while &s;he
<PB N="180" REF="190">
was unhappy, from whatever cau&s;e, &s;he &s;till would pity her."</P>
<P>"Go to Mr. Dorriforth then, and prevent him from impo&s;ing upon lord Frederick."</P>
<P>"But that impo&s;ition is the only means to prevent the duel." Replied Mi&s;s Woodley. "The moment I have told him you have no regard for his lord&s;hip, he will no longer refu&s;e to fight with him."</P>
<P>"Then at all events I am undone," exclaimed Mi&s;s Milner, "for the duel is horrible, even beyond every thing el&s;e."</P>
<P>"How &s;o?" returned Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "&s;ince you have declared you do not care for lord Frederick."</P>
<P>"But are you &s;o blind," returned Mi&s;s Milner with a degree of madne&s;s in her looks, "to believe I do not care
<PB N="181" REF="191">
for Mr. Dorriforth? Oh, Mi&s;s Wood|ley! I love him with all the pa&s;&s;ion of a mi&s;tre&s;s, and with all the tenderne&s;s of a wife."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley at this &s;entence &s;at down&mdash;it was on a chair that was clo&s;e to her&mdash;her feet could not have taken her to any other.&mdash;She trembled&mdash;&s;he was white as a&s;hes, and deprived of &s;peech. Mi&s;s Milner, taking her by the hand, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I know what you feel &mdash; I know what you think of me&mdash;and how much you hate and de&s;pi&s;e me.&mdash;But Heaven is witne&s;s to all my &s;truggles &mdash; nor would I, even to my&s;elf, acknowledge the &s;hamele&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, till forced by a &s;en&s;e of his danger"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Silence." Cried Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;truck with horror.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="192">"And even now," re&s;umed Mi&s;s Milner, "have I not concealed it from all but you, by plunging my&s;elf into a new difficulty, from whence I know not how I &s;hall be extricated?&mdash;And do I entertain a hope? No, Mi&s;s Woodley, nor ever will.&mdash;But &s;uffer me to own my folly to you &mdash; to entreat your &s;oothing friend&s;hip to free me from my weakne&s;s. &mdash; And, oh! give me your friendly advice to deliver me from the difficulties which &s;urround me."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley was &s;till pale, and &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Education, is called &s;econd nature; in the &s;trict (but not enlarged) educa|tion of Mi&s;s Woodley, it was more powerful than the fir&s;t&mdash;and the viola|tion of oaths, per&s;ons, or things con&s;e|crated to Heaven, was, in her opinion,
<PB N="183" REF="193">
if not the mo&s;t enormous, the mo&s;t horrid among the catalogue of crimes.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner had lived too long in a family who had imbibed tho&s;e opinions not to be convinced of their exi&s;tence; nay, her own rea&s;on told her that &s;o|lemn vows of whatever kind, ought to be binding; and the more &s;he re&s;pected her guardian's under&s;tanding, the le&s;s &s;he called in que&s;tion his religious te|nets&mdash;in e&s;teeming him, &s;he e&s;teemed all his notions; and among the re&s;t, even venerated tho&s;e of his religion.&mdash; Yet that pa&s;&s;ion, which had unhappily taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her whole &s;oul, would not have been in&s;pired, had there not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted an early difference, in their &s;y&s;tems of divine faith&mdash;had &s;he been early taught what were the &s;acred func|tions of a Roman eccle&s;ia&s;tick, though
<PB N="184" REF="194">
all her e&s;teem, all her admiration, had been attracted by the qualities and ac|compli&s;hments of her guardian; yet education would have given &s;uch a pro|hibition to her love, that &s;he had been precluded from it, as by that barrier which divides a &s;i&s;ter from a brother.</P>
<P>This, unfortunately, was not the ca&s;e; and Mi&s;s Milner loved Dorriforth with|out one con&s;cious check to tell her &s;he was wrong, except that which con|vinced her, her love would be avoided by him, with dete&s;tation, with horror.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, &s;omething recover|ed from her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;uf|fering&mdash;for never did her &s;u&s;ceptible mind &s;uffer &s;o exqui&s;itely&mdash;amid&s;t all the grief and abhorrence &s;he felt, pity
<PB N="185" REF="195">
was &s;till predominant&mdash;and reconciled to the faults of Mi&s;s Milner by her mi&s;ery, &s;he once more looked at her with friend&s;hip, and a&s;ked, "what &s;he could do, to render her le&s;s unhappy?"</P>
<P>"Make me forget," replied Mi&s;s Milner, "every moment of my pa&s;t life &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw you&mdash;that moment was teeming with a weight of cares I mu&s;t labour under till my death."</P>
<P>"And even in death," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "do not be &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to hope to &s;hake them off&mdash;if unre|pented in this world"&mdash;</P>
<P>She was proceeding&mdash;but the anxiety her friend endured, would not &s;uffer her to be wholly free from the appre|hen&s;ion, that notwith&s;tanding the po&s;i|tive a&s;&s;urance of her guardian, (&s;hould he and lord Frederick me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">) the duel might &s;till take place; &s;he therefore
<PB N="186" REF="196">
rung the bell and enquired if Mr. Dor|riforth was &s;till at home?&mdash;the an&s;wer was&mdash;"He is rode out."&mdash;"You re|member," &s;aid Mi&s;s Woodley, "he told you he &s;hould dine out."&mdash;This did not, however, di&s;mi&s;s her fears, and &s;he di&s;patched two &s;ervants different ways in pur&s;uit of him, acquainting them with her &s;u&s;picions, and charg|ing them to prevent his and lord Fre|derick's meeting. Sandford had al&s;o taken his precautions; but though he knew the time, he did not know the exact place of their appointment, for that, lord Elmwood had forgot to en|quire.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive alarm which Mi&s;s Mil|ner di&s;covered upon this occa&s;ion, was imputed by the &s;ervants, and others who were witne&s;s of it, to her affection
<PB N="187" REF="197">
for lord Edward, while none but Mi&s;s Woodley knew, or had the mo&s;t di&s;|tant &s;u&s;picion of the real cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Horton and Mi&s;s Fenton, who were &s;itting together expatiating on the duplicity of their own &s;ex in the in&s;tance ju&s;t before them, had, notwith&s;tanding the intere&s;t of the di&s;cour&s;e, a longing de&s;ire to break it off; for they were im|patient to &s;ee this poor frail being whom they were loading with their in|nocent&mdash;as it was among friends&mdash;ca|lumny. They longed to &s;ee if &s;he would have the confidence to look them in the face: they, to whom &s;he had &s;o often prote&s;ted, &s;he had not the &s;malle&s;t attachment to lord Frederick but from motives of vanity.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="198">The&s;e ladies heard with much &s;ati&s;|faction dinner was &s;erved, but met Mi&s;s Milner at table with a le&s;s degree of plea&s;ure than they expected; for her mind was &s;o totally ab&s;tracted from them, they could not di&s;cern a &s;ingle blu&s;h, or confu&s;ed glance, which their pre&s;ence occa&s;ioned. No, Mi&s;s Milner had before them divulged nothing of which &s;he was a&s;hamed, &s;he only was a&s;hamed what &s;he had &s;aid was not truth. In the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s Woodley alone, was that &s;ecret entru&s;ted which could call a blu&s;h into her face, and before her &s;he <HI>did</HI> feel confu&s;ion&mdash;be|fore the gentle friend, to whom &s;he had till this time communicated all her faults without embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;he now ca&s;t down her eyes in &s;hame, and &s;carce dur&s;t lift them up to meet her's.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="199">At table there was little talking, and le&s;s eating; Mi&s;s Milner did not at|tempt to eat; Mi&s;s Woodley endea|voured, but could not.</P>
<P>Soon after the dinner was removed, lord Elmwood entered; and that gallant no|bleman declared&mdash;"Mr. Sandford had u&s;ed him ill in not permitting him to accompany his relation; for he feared Dorriforth would now throw him&s;elf upon the &s;word of lord Frederick with|out a friend by to defend him."&mdash;A re|buke from the eye of Mi&s;s Woodley, which from this day forward had a command over Mi&s;s Milner, re&s;trained her from expre&s;&s;ing the affright &s;he &s;uf|fered from this &s;uppo&s;ition of his lord|&s;hip's. Mi&s;s Fenton replied, "As to that, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why Mr. Dorriforth and lord Frederick &s;hould
<PB N="190" REF="200">
not now be friends.&mdash;"Certainly," &s;aid Mrs. Horton, "for as &s;oon as my lord Frederick is made acquainted with Mi&s;s Milner's confe&s;&s;ion, all differences mu&s;t be reconciled."&mdash;"What confe&s;&s;ion?" a&s;ked his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, to avoid hearing a re|petition of that which gave her pain but to think of, aro&s;e in order to retire into her own apartment, but was obliged to &s;it down again&mdash;and received the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her friend and lord Elm|wood to lead her into her dre&s;&s;ing|room. Reclined upon a &s;opha there, a &s;ilence en&s;ued between her and Mi&s;s Woodley for near half an hour; and when the conver&s;ation began, the name of Dorriforth was never uttered&mdash;they were both grown cool and con&s;iderate &s;ince the di&s;covery, and both were
<PB N="191" REF="201">
equally a&s;hamed and fearful of naming him.</P>
<P>The vanity of the world, the folly of riches, the plea&s;ures of retirement, and &s;uch topics engaged their di&s;cour&s;e, but not their thoughts, for near two hours; and the fir&s;t time the word Dorriforth was &s;poken, a &s;ervant with alacrity opened the dre&s;&s;ing room door, without previou&s;ly rapping, and cried, "Mr. Dorriforth, madam."</P>
<P>Dorriforth immediately came in, and went eagerly to Mi&s;s Milner.&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley beheld the glow of joy, and guilt upon her face, and did not ri&s;e to give him her &s;eat, as was her cu&s;tom if he came with intelligence to his ward, and &s;he was &s;itting next her &mdash;he therefore &s;tood while he repeated
<PB N="192" REF="202">
all that had happened in his interview with lord Frederick.</P>
<P>But with her gladne&s;s to &s;ee her guardian &s;afe, Mi&s;s Milner had forgot to enquire for the &s;afety of his lord&s;hip; the man whom &s;he had pretended to love &s;o pa&s;|&s;ionately&mdash;even a &s;mile of rapture was upen her face, though Dorriforth might be returned from putting him to death. This incongruity of behaviour Mi&s;s Woodley &s;aw, and was confounded&mdash; but Dorriforth, in who&s;e thoughts a &s;u&s;picion either of her love to him, or want of love for lord Frederick, had not the &s;malle&s;t place, ea&s;ily reconciled this incon&s;i&s;tency, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"You &s;ee by my countenance all is well, and therefore you &s;mile on me before I tell you what has pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="203">This brought her to the recollection of her conduct, and now with a coun|tenance con&s;trained to &s;ome &s;how of gravity, &s;he tried to expre&s;s alarm &s;he did not feel.</P>
<P>"Nay, I have the plea&s;ure to a&s;&s;ure you Lord Frederick is &s;afe," re&s;umed Dorriforth, "and the di&s;grace of his blow wa&s;hed entirely away, by a few drops of blood from this arm," and he laid his hand upon his left arm, which re&s;ted in his wai&s;tcoat as a &s;ling.</P>
<P>She ca&s;t her eyes there, and &s;eeing where the ball had entered the coat &s;leeve, &s;he gave an involuntary &s;cream, and &s;unk on the &s;ide of the &s;opha. In|&s;tead of that tender &s;ympathy with which Mi&s;s Woodley u&s;ed to attend her upon the &s;lighte&s;t illne&s;s or affliction, &s;he now addre&s;&s;ed her in a &s;harp tone, and cried, "Mi&s;s Milner, you have
<PB N="194" REF="204">
heard lord Frederick is &s;afe, you have then nothing to alarm you."&mdash;Nor did &s;he run to offer a &s;melling bottle, or to rai&s;e her head. Her guardian &s;eeing her near fainting, and without this a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from her friend, was going him&s;elf to give it; but on this, Mi&s;s Woodley interfered, and having taken her head upon her arm, a&s;&s;ured him, "It was a trifling weakne&s;s to which Mi&s;s Milner was accu&s;tomed, and that &s;he would ring for her woman, who knew how to relieve her in&s;tantly with a few drops."&mdash;Satisfied with this, Dorriforth left the room; and a &s;urgeon being ar|rived to dre&s;s his wound, he retired into his own chamber.</P>

<P>THE power delegated to the keeper of our &s;ecrets, Mi&s;s Woodley was the la&s;t per&s;on on earth to abu&s;e &mdash; but &s;he was al&s;o the la&s;t, who, by her complacency would participate in the guilt of her friend&mdash;and there was no guilt, except that of murder, which &s;he thought equal to the crime in que&s;tion, provided it was ever perpetrated. &mdash; Adultery, her rea&s;on would perhaps have informed her, was a more perni|cious evil to &s;ociety; but to a religious mind, what &s;ounds &s;o horrible as &s;acri|lege? Of vows made to God or to man, the former mu&s;t weigh the heavier.&mdash; Moreover, the dreadful &s;in of infidelity in the marriage &s;tate, is much &s;oftened

to a common under&s;tanding, by the frequency of the crime; whereas, of vows broken by a devotee &s;he had &s;carce heard of any; or if any, they were generally followed by &s;uch exam|ples of divine vengeance, &s;uch mira|culous puni&s;hments in this world, (as well as eternal puni&s;hment in the other) that &s;erved to exaggerate their wicked|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>She, who could, and did pardon Mi&s;s Milner, was the per&s;on who &s;aw her pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;evere&s;t light, and re|&s;olved to take every method, however har&s;h, to root it from her heart&mdash;nor did &s;he fear &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;ting on the cer|tain a&s;&s;urance, that however deep her love was fixed, it would never be re|turned. Yet this confidence did not prevent her taking every precaution, le&s;t
<PB N="197" REF="209">
Dorriforth &s;hould come to the know|ledge of it&mdash;&s;he would not have his compo&s;ed mind di&s;turbed with &s;uch a thought &mdash; his &s;teadfa&s;t principles &s;o much as &s;hook by the imagination&mdash; nor overwhelm him with tho&s;e &s;elf-re|proaches which his fatal attraction, un|premeditated as it was, would &s;till have drawn upon him.</P>
<P>With this plan of concealment, in which the natural mode&s;ty of Mi&s;s Mil|ner acquie&s;ced, there was but one ef|fort to make which that young lady was not prepared for; and that was an en|tire &s;eparation from her guardian.&mdash;She had, from the fir&s;t, cheri&s;hed her pa&s;|&s;ion without the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of a return&mdash;&s;he was prepared to &s;ee Dorriforth without ever &s;eeing him nearer to her than her guardian and
<PB N="198" REF="210">
friend, but not to &s;ee him at all&mdash;for that, &s;he was not prepared.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Woodley reflected upon the inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;tep before &s;he made the propo&s;al, and then made it with a firmne&s;s, that might have done honour to the inflexibility of Dorriforth him&s;elf.</P>
<P>During the few days that intervened between her open confe&s;&s;ion of love for lord Frederick, and this propo&s;al, the mo&s;t intricate incoherence appeared to the whole family, in the character of Mi&s;s Milner&mdash;and in order to evade a mar|riage with his lord&s;hip, and to conceal, at the &s;ame time, the &s;hameful propen|&s;ity which lurked in her brea&s;t, &s;he was once, even on the point of declaring a pa&s;&s;ion for Sir Edward A&s;hton.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="211">In the duel which had taken place between lord Frederick and Dorriforth, the latter had received his antagoni&s;t's fire, but po&s;itively refu&s;ed to return it; by which he had kept his promi&s;e not to endanger his lord&s;hip's life, and had re|conciled Sandford, in great mea&s;ure, to his behaviour&mdash;and Sandford now (his re&s;olution once broken) no longer refu&s;ed entering Mi&s;s Milner's hou&s;e, but came every time it was convenient, though he yet avoided its mi&s;tre&s;s as much as po&s;&s;ible; or &s;howed by every word and look, when &s;he was pre&s;ent, that &s;he was &s;till le&s;s in his favour than &s;he had ever been.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited Dorriforth on the evening after his engagement with lord Frederick, and again the next morning breakfa&s;t|ed with him in his own chamber; nor did Mi&s;s Milner &s;ee her guardian &s;ince his fir&s;t return from that engagement

<P>When Dorriforth made his appear|ance the next day, it was evident he had thrown from his heart a load of cares; and though they had left a languor upon his face, there was content in his voice, his manners, in his every word and ac|tion.&mdash;Far from &s;eeming to retain any re&s;entment towards his ward, for the trouble and danger into which her im|prudence had led him, he appeared ra|ther to pity her weakne&s;s, and to wi&s;h to &s;ooth the perturbation which the re|collection of her own conduct had ob|viou&s;ly
<PB N="201" REF="213">
rai&s;ed in her mind&mdash;His endea|vours were mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful&mdash;&s;he was &s;oothed every time he &s;poke to her; and had not the watchful eye of Mi&s;s Woodley &s;tood guard over her inclina|tions, &s;he had plainly evinced, &s;he was enraptured with the joy of &s;eeing him again him&s;elf, after the danger to which he had been expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e emotions, which &s;he laboured to &s;ubdue, pa&s;&s;ed, however, the bounds of her ineffectual re&s;i&s;tance; when at the time of retiring after dinner, he &s;aid to her in a low voice, but &s;uch as it was meant the company &s;hould hear, "Do me the favour, Mi&s;s Milner, to call at my &s;tudy &s;ometime in the even|ing; I have to &s;peak to you upon bu&s;i|ne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="214">She an&s;wered, "I will, Sir." And her eyes &s;wam with delight in expecta|tion of the interview.</P>
<P>Let not the reader, neverthele&s;s ima|gine, there was in that ardent expecta|tion, one idea which the mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s mind, in love, might not have indul|ged without reproach.&mdash;Sincere love, (at lea&s;t among the delicate of the fe|male &s;ex) is often gratified by that de|gree of enjoyment, or rather forbear|ance, which would be torture in the pur&s;uit of any other pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;real, de|licate, and re&s;trained love, like that of Mi&s;s Milner's, was indulged in the &s;ight of the object only; and having bounded her wi&s;hes by her hopes, the height of her happine&s;s was limited to a con|ver&s;ation in which no other but them|&s;elves partook a part.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="215">Mi&s;s Woodley was one who heard the appointment, but the only one who conceived with what &s;en&s;ation it was received.</P>
<P>While the ladies remained in the &s;ame room with Dorriforth, Mi&s;s Milner thought of little, except of him&mdash;as &s;oon as they withdrew into another apartment, &s;he remembered Mi&s;s Woodley, and turning her head &s;ud|denly, &s;aw Mi&s;s Woodley's face im|printed with &s;u&s;picion and di&s;plea&s;ure&mdash; this at fir&s;t was painful to her&mdash;but re|collecting that in a couple of hours time &s;he was to meet her guardian alone&mdash; &s;peak to him, and hear him &s;peak to her&s;elf only&mdash;every other thought was ab&s;orbed in that one, and &s;he con&s;ider|ed with indifference, the unea&s;ine&s;s, or the anger of her friend.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="216">Mi&s;s Milner, to do ju&s;tice to her heart, did not wi&s;h to beguile Dorri|forth into the &s;nares of love.&mdash;Could any &s;upernatural power have endowed her with the means, and at the &s;ame time &s;hewn to her the ills that mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch an effect of her charms, &s;he had a&s;&s;uredly enough of virtue to have declined the conque&s;t; but without en|quiring of her&s;elf what &s;he propo&s;ed? She never &s;aw him without previou&s;ly endeavouring to look more attractive than &s;he would have de&s;ired, in any other company.&mdash;And now, without li&s;tening to the thou&s;and exhortations that were &s;peaking in every feature of Mi&s;s Woodley's face, &s;he flew to a looking-gla&s;s, to adju&s;t her dre&s;s in a manner than &s;he thought mo&s;t enchant|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="217">Time &s;tole away, and the time to go to her guardian arrived. In his pre|&s;ence, un&s;upported by the pre&s;ence of a third per&s;on, every grace &s;he had practi&s;ed, every look &s;he had borrowed to &s;et off her charms were annihilated, and &s;he became a native beauty, with the artle&s;s arguments of rea&s;on, only for her aid.&mdash;Awed thus, by his power, from every thing but what &s;he really was, &s;he never was perhaps half &s;o be|witching as in tho&s;e timid, re&s;pectful, and embarra&s;&s;ed moments &s;he pa&s;&s;ed alone with him.&mdash;He caught at tho&s;e times her re&s;pect, her diffidence, nay, even her embarra&s;&s;ment; and never would one word of anger pa&s;s on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, he fir&s;t, ex|pre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction that &s;he

had at length, revealed to him the &s;tate of her mind.</P>
<P>"And taking every thing into con|&s;ideration, Mi&s;s Milner," added he, "I rejoice that your &s;entiments happen to be &s;uch as you have owned&mdash;for al|though my lord Frederick is not the very man I could have wi&s;hed for your perfect happine&s;s, yet in the &s;tate of human perfection and human happi|ne&s;s, you might have fixed your affec|tions with much le&s;s propriety; and yet, where my unwillingne&s;s to thwart your inclinations, might not have per|mitted me to contend with them."</P>
<P>Not a word of reply did this demand, or if it had, not a word could &s;he have given.</P>
<P>"And now, madam, the rea&s;on of my de&s;ire to &s;peak with you&mdash;is to know from your&s;elf, the means you think mo&s;t
<PB N="207" REF="219">
proper to pur&s;ue, in order to acquaint his lord&s;hip, that notwith&s;tanding this late repul&s;e, there are hopes of your par|tiality in his favour."</P>
<P>"Defer the explanation." Returned &s;he, eagerly.</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, Mi&s;s Milner, that cannot be&mdash;be&s;ides, how can you indulge a di&s;po&s;ition thus unpitying?&mdash; even &s;o ardently did I de&s;ire to render his lord&s;hip happy, though he came armed again&s;t my life, that had I not reflected, previous to our engagement it would appear like fear, and the means of bartering for his forgivene&s;s; I &s;hould have revealed your &s;entiments the moment I had &s;een him. When the engagement was over, I was too impatient to acquaint you of his &s;afety, to think then on gratifying him.&mdash;And indeed, the delicacy of the declaration, after the many denials you have no
<PB N="208" REF="220">
doubt given him, &s;hould be con&s;idered&mdash; I therefore entreat your approbation of the manner in which it &s;hall be made."</P>
<P>"Mr. Dorriforth, can you allow nothing to the moments of &s;urprize? and that pity, which the fate impending in&s;pired; and which might urge me to expre&s;s my&s;elf of lord Frederick, in a manner my cooler thoughts will not warrant?"</P>
<P>"There was nothing in your expre&s;|&s;ions, my dear Mi&s;s Milner, the lea&s;t equivocal&mdash;if you were off your guard, when you pleaded for lord Frederick, as I believe you were, you &s;aid more &s;incerely what you thought; and no di&s;creet, or rather indi&s;creet retractions, can make me change my opinion."</P>
<P>"I am very &s;orry." She replied, con|fu&s;ed, and trembling.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="221">"Why &s;orry? Come, give me com|mi&s;&s;ion to reveal the&s;e &s;entiments.&mdash;I'll not be too hard upon you&mdash;a hint from me to his lord&s;hip will do&mdash;hope, is ever apt to interpret the &s;lighte&s;t words to its own u&s;e, and a lover's hope, is beyond all others, &s;anguine."</P>
<P>"I never gave lord Frederick hope."</P>
<P>"But did you ever plunge him into de&s;pair?"</P>
<P>"His pur&s;uit &s;ays I never have, but he has no other proof."</P>
<P>"However light and frivolous you have been upon frivolous &s;ubjects, yet I mu&s;t own, Mi&s;s Milner, I expected, that when a ca&s;e of this importance came &s;eriou&s;ly before you, you would have di&s;covered a proper &s;tability in your behaviour."</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="222">"I do, Sir; and it was only while I was affected with a weakne&s;s, which aro&s;e from accident, that I have ever &s;hewed an incon&s;i&s;tence."</P>
<P>"You then &s;till a&s;&s;ert you have no affection for my lord Frederick?"</P>
<P>"Not &s;ufficient to become his wife."</P>
<P>"You are alarmed at marriage, and I do not wonder you &s;hould be &s;o; it &s;hews a prudent fore&s;ight that does you honour&mdash;but, my dear, are there no dangers in a &s;ingle &s;tate?&mdash;if I may judge, Mi&s;s Milner, there are many more to a young lady of your accom|pli&s;hments, than were you under the pro|tection of a hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"My father, Mr. Dorriforth, thought your protection &s;ufficient."</P>
<P>"But that protection was rather to di|rect your choice, than to be the cau&s;e of your not choo&s;ing at all.&mdash;Give me leave
<PB N="211" REF="223">
to point out an ob&s;ervation which, per|haps, I have too frequently done be|fore, but upon this occa&s;ion I mu&s;t in|trude it once again.&mdash;Mi&s;s Fenton is its object&mdash;her fortune is inferior to your's, her per&s;onal attractions le&s;s."&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the &s;trong glow of joy, and of gratitude, for an opinion &s;o negligent|ly, and yet &s;o &s;incerely expre&s;&s;ed, flew to Mi&s;s Milner's face, neck, and even to her hands and fingers; the blood mounted to every part of her &s;kin that was vi&s;ible, for not a fibre but felt the &s;ecret tran&s;port, that Dorriforth thought her more beautiful than the beautiful Mi&s;s Fenton.</P>
<P>If he ob&s;erved her blu&s;hes, he was un&s;u&s;picious of the cau&s;e, and went on.</P>
<P>"There is, be&s;ides, in the temper of Mi&s;s Fenton, a &s;edatene&s;s that might with le&s;s hazard &s;ecure her &s;afety in an

unmarried life; and yet &s;he very pro|perly thinks it her duty, as &s;he does not mean to &s;eclude her&s;elf by any vows to the contrary, to become a wife&mdash;and in obedience to the coun&s;el of her friends, will be married within a very few weeks."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fenton may marry from obe|dience, I never will."</P>
<P>"You mean to &s;ay, Love &s;hall alone induce you?"</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"If, madam, you would point out a &s;ubject upon which I am the lea&s;t able to &s;peak, and on which my &s;entiments, &s;uch as they are, are formed alone from theory (and even there in&s;tructed but with caution) it is the &s;ubject of love. &mdash;And yet, Mi&s;s Milner, even that little I know, tells me, without a doubt, that what you &s;aid to me ye&s;terday, pleading
<PB N="213" REF="225">
for lord Frederick's life, was the re&s;ult of the mo&s;t violent and tender love."</P>
<P>"The <HI>little you know</HI> then, Mr. Dor|riforth, has deceived you; had you <HI>known more,</HI> you would have judged otherwi&s;e."</P>
<P>"I &s;ubmit to the merit of your re|ply; but without allowing me a judge at all, I will appeal to tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent with me."</P>
<P>"Are Mrs. Horton and Mr. Sand|ford to be the connoi&s;&s;eurs?"</P>
<P>"No; I'll appeal to Mi&s;s Fenton and Mi&s;s Woodley."</P>
<P>"And yet, I believe," replied &s;he with a &s;mile, "I believe, theory, mu&s;t only be the judge even there."</P>
<P>"Then from all you have &s;aid, ma|dam, on this occa&s;ion, I am to conclude you &s;till refu&s;e to marry lord Frede|rick?"</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="226">"You are."</P>
<P>"And you &s;ubmit never to &s;ee him again?"</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"All you then &s;aid to me, ye&s;terday, was fal&s;e?"</P>
<P>"I was not mi&s;tre&s;s of my&s;elf at the time."</P>
<P>"Therefore it was truth&mdash;for &s;hame, for &s;hame!"</P>
<P>At that moment the door opened, and Mr. Sandford walked in&mdash;he &s;tarted back on &s;eeing Mi&s;s Milner, and was going away again; but Dorriforth called to him to &s;tay, and &s;aid with warmth,</P>
<P>"Tell me, Mr. Sandford, by what power, by what per&s;ua&s;ion, I can pre|vail upon this lady to confide in me as her friend; to lay her heart open, and credit mine when I declare to her, I
<PB N="215" REF="227">
have no view in all the advice I give, but her immediate welfare?"</P>
<P>"Mr. Dorriforth, you know my opinion of the lady," replied, Sandford, "it has been formed ever &s;ince my fir&s;t acquaintance with her, and it &s;till remains the &s;ame."</P>
<P>"But in&s;truct me how I am to in&s;pire her with confidence;" returned Dorri|forth, "how I am to impre&s;s her with that which is for her advantage?"</P>
<P>"You can work no miracles," replied Sandford, "you are not holy enough."</P>
<P>"And yet Mi&s;s Milner," an&s;wered Dorriforth, "appears to be acquainted with that my&s;tery; for what but the force of a miracle, can induce her to contra|dict to-day, what before you, and &s;eve|ral other witne&s;&s;es, &s;he po&s;itively ac|knowledged ye&s;terday?"</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="228">"Do you call that miraculous?" cried Sandford, "The miracle had been if &s;he had not done &s;o&mdash;for did &s;he not ye&s;terday, contradict what &s;he acknow|ledged the day before?&mdash;and will &s;he not to-morrow, di&s;avow what &s;he &s;ays to-day?"</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h &s;he may." Replied Dorri|forth mildly, for he beheld the tears flowing down her face at the rough and &s;evere manner in which Sandford had &s;poken, and began to feel for her un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"I beg pardon," cried Sandford, "for &s;peaking &s;o rudely to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e&mdash;I have no bu&s;ine&s;s here, I know; but where you are, Mr. Dorri|forth, unle&s;s I am turned out, I &s;hall ever think it my duty to come."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner courte&s;ied, as much as to &s;ay he was welcome to come.&mdash;He continued,</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="229">"I was to blame, that on a nice punctilio, I left you &s;o long without my vi&s;its, and without my coun&s;el; in the time, you have run the hazard of being murdered, and what is wor&s;e, of being excommunicated; for had you been &s;o ra&s;h as to have returned your opponent's fire, not all my intere&s;t at Rome would have obtained remi&s;&s;ion of the puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner, through all her tears, could not now re&s;train her laughter&mdash;on which he re&s;umed;</P>
<P>"And here do I venture like a mi&s;|&s;ionary among &s;avages&mdash;but if I can only &s;ave you from the &s;calping knives of &s;ome of them; from the mi&s;eries which that lady is preparing for you, I am rewarded."</P>
<P>Sandford &s;poke this with great fer|vour, and the crime of her love never
<PB N="218" REF="230">
appeared to Mi&s;s Milner in &s;o tremen|dous a point of view as thus, unknow|ingly alluded to by him.</P>
<P>"<HI>The mi&s;eries that lady is preparing for you,</HI>" hung upon her ears like the notes of a raven, and equally ominous.&mdash;The words "<HI>murder</HI>" and "<HI>excommunication</HI>" he had likewi&s;e uttered; all the fatal effects of &s;acrilegious love.&mdash;Frightful &s;uper&s;titions &s;truck to her heart, and &s;he could &s;carcely prevent falling down under their oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Dorriforth beheld the difficulty &s;he had in &s;u&s;taining her&s;elf, and went with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and &s;upported her; &s;aying, "I beg your pardon&mdash;I invited you hither with a far different view than your unea&s;ine&s;s."&mdash;</P>
<P>Sandford was begining to &s;peak. "Hold, Mr. Sandford," re&s;umed he, "the lady is under my protection, and
<PB N="219" REF="231">
I know not whether it is not nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould apologize to her, and to me, for what you have already &s;aid."</P>
<P>"You a&s;ked my opinion, or I had not given it you&mdash;would you have me, like her, &s;peak what I do not think?"</P>
<P>"Say no more, Mr. Sandford." Cried Dorriforth &mdash; and leading her kindly to the door, as if to defend her from his malice, told her "He would take another opportunity to renew the &s;ub|ject."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Dorriforth was alone with Sandford, he explained to him what before, he had only hinted; and this learned je&s;uit frankly confe&s;&s;ed, "That the mind of a woman was far above, or rather beneath, his comprehen&s;ion." &mdash;It was &s;o, indeed&mdash;for with all his pe|netration, and he had a great deal, he had not yet penetrated into the rece&s;&s;es of Mi&s;s Milner's heart.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodley, to whom &s;he repeated all that had pa&s;&s;ed between her&s;elf, her guardian, and Sandford, took this mo|ment, during the alarm and agitation of her &s;pirits, to alarm them &s;till more by her prophetic in&s;inuations; and at
<PB N="221" REF="233">
length repre&s;ented to her here, for the fir&s;t time, the nece&s;&s;ity, "That Mr. Dorriforth and &s;he &s;hould remain no longer under the &s;ame roof." This was like the &s;troke of &s;udden death to Mi&s;s Milner, and clinging to life, &s;he endeavoured to avert the blow by prayers, and by promi&s;es&mdash;her friend loved her too &s;incerely, however, to be prevailed upon.</P>
<P>"But in what manner can I bring about the &s;eparation?" cried &s;he, "for till I marry we are obliged, by my fa|ther's reque&s;t, to live in the &s;ame hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Milner," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Woodley, "much as I re&s;pect the will of a dying man, I regard your and Mr. Dorriforth's pre&s;ent, and eternal happine&s;s much more; and it is my re|&s;olution you <HI>&s;hall part</HI>&mdash;if you will not contrive the means, that duty falls on
<PB N="222" REF="234">
me, and without any invention, I &s;ee the mea&s;ure at once."</P>
<P>"What is it?" Cried Mi&s;s Milner eagerly.</P>
<P>"To go and reveal to Mr. Dorri|forth, without he&s;itation, the real &s;tate of your heart; which your pre&s;ent incon|&s;i&s;tent conduct will but too readily con|firm."</P>
<P>"You would not plunge me into &s;o much &s;hame, into &s;o much angui&s;h!" Cried &s;he, di&s;tractedly.</P>
<P>"No," replied Mi&s;s Woodley, "not for the world, provided you will &s;epa|rate from him, by any method of your own&mdash;but that you <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;eparate is my determination; and in &s;pite of all your &s;ufferings, this &s;hall be the means, un|le&s;s you in&s;tantly agree to &s;ome other."</P>
<P>"Good Heaven, Mi&s;s Woodley! is this your friend&s;hip?"</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="235">"Yes&mdash;and the true&s;t friend&s;hip I have to be&s;tow.&mdash;Think what a ta&s;k I undertake for your &s;ake and his, when I condemn my&s;elf to explain to him your weakne&s;s &mdash; what a&s;toni&s;hment! what confu&s;ion! what remor&s;e, do I fore&s;ee painted upon his face!&mdash;I hear him call you by the har&s;he&s;t names, and behold him fly from your &s;ight for ever, as an object of his dete&s;tation."</P>
<P>"Oh &s;pare the dreadful picture.&mdash;Fly from my &s;ight for ever &mdash; dete&s;t my name.

<P><PB N="224" REF="236">Mi&s;s Woodley immediately began to plan &s;chemes for their &s;eparation; and with all her invention alive on the &s;ub|ject, this was the only probable one &s;he could form.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Milner was to write to her di&s;|tant relation at Bath, complaining of the melancholy of a country life, which &s;he was to &s;ay her guardian impo&s;ed upon her, and entreat the lady to &s;end a pre&s;&s;ing invitation for her to pa&s;s a month or two with her; this invitation was to be &s;hewn to Dorriforth for his approbation, and both Mi&s;s Woodley and Mi&s;s Milner were to enforce it, by expre&s;&s;ing their earne&s;t wi&s;hes for his con&s;ent. This plan properly regulated, the nece&s;&s;ary letter was &s;ent by Mi&s;s Milner to Bath, and Mi&s;s Woodley
<PB N="225" REF="237">
waited with patience, but with a watch|ful guard upon the conduct of her friend till the an&s;wer arrived.</P>
<P>During this interim a mo&s;t tender and complaining epi&s;tle from lord Frederick was delivered Mi&s;s Milner; to which as he received no an&s;wer, his lord&s;hip prevailed upon his uncle, with whom he re&s;ided, to wait upon her, and obtain her verbal reply; for he &s;till flattered him&s;elf, fear of her guardian's anger, or perhaps his interception of the letter he had &s;ent, was the cau&s;e of her &s;eem|ing contempt.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was introduced to Mi&s;s Milner, and after to Mr. Dorriforth, but received from each an an&s;wer &s;o explicit, that left his ne|phew
<PB N="226" REF="238">
no longer in doubt but all farther pur&s;uit was vain.</P>
<P>Sir Edward A&s;hton about this time al&s;o, &s;ubmitted to a formal di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and had the mortification to reflect, he was be&s;towing upon the object of his affections the tendere&s;t proof of his re|gard, by ab&s;enting him&s;elf wholly from her &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;erious and certain conclu|&s;ion to the hopes of lord Frederick, Dorriforth was more a&s;toni&s;hed than he had ever yet been at the conduct of his ward&mdash;he had once thought her beha|viour, in re&s;pect to his lord&s;hip, was ambiguous, but &s;ince her confe&s;&s;ion of a pa&s;&s;ion for him, he had no doubt but that in the end, &s;he would become his wife. &mdash; He lamented to find him&s;elf
<PB N="227" REF="239">
mi&s;taken, and now thought it proper to give &s;ome important marks of his condemnation of her pernicious caprice; and not merely in words, but by the general tenour of his be|haviour. He con&s;equently became much more re&s;erved, and more au&s;tere than he had been, &s;ince his fir&s;t ac|quaintance with her; for his manners, not from de&s;ign, but unknowingly, were &s;oftened &s;ince his guardian&s;hip, by that render re&s;pect he had never cea&s;ed to pay to the object of his protection.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;everity he a&s;|&s;umed, his ward in the pro&s;pect of part|ing from him grew melancholy; Mi&s;s Woodley's love to her friend rendered her little otherwi&s;e; and Dorriforth's pe|culiar gravity, oftentimes rigour, could not but make the whole party much
<PB N="228" REF="240">
le&s;s cheerful than they had been. Lord Elmwood too was lying dangerou&s;ly ill of a fever; Mi&s;s Fenton of cour&s;e was as much in &s;orrow as her nature would &s;uffer her to be, and both Sandford and Dorriforth in extreme concern on his lord&s;hip's account.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of affairs, the letter of in|vitation arrives from lady Luneham at Bath: it was &s;hown to Dorriforth; and to prove to his ward he is &s;o much of|fended, as no longer to feel that exce&s;|&s;ive intere&s;t in her concerns he once did, he gives his opinion on the &s;ubject with indifference &mdash; he de&s;ires "Mi&s;s Milner will do as &s;he her&s;elf thinks pro|per."&mdash;Mi&s;s Woodley in&s;tantly accepts this permi&s;&s;ion, writes back, and ap|points the day, her friend means to &s;et off for the vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="241">She is wounded to the heart by the cold and unkind manners of her guar|dian, but dares not take one method to retrieve his opinion.&mdash;Alone, and to Mi&s;s Woodley &s;he &s;ighs and weeps; he di&s;|covers her &s;orrow, and is doubtful whe|ther the departure of lord Frederick from that part of the country, is not the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>When the day on which &s;he was to &s;et off for Bath, was within two days di&s;tance only; the behaviour of Dorri|forth took, by degrees, its u&s;ual form; if not a greater &s;hare of polite and ten|der attention than ever.&mdash;It was the fir&s;t time he had parted from Mi&s;s Mil|ner &s;ince he became her guardian, and he felt upon the occa&s;ion, a reluctance. &mdash;He had been angry with her, he had &s;hewn her he was &s;o, and he now began
<PB N="230" REF="242">
to wi&s;h he had not.&mdash;She is not happy, (he con&s;idered within him&s;elf) every word and action declares &s;he is not, and I may have been too &s;evere, and added to her unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;"At lea&s;t we will part on good terms."&mdash;Said he&mdash;"In|deed my regard for her is &s;uch, I cannot part otherwi&s;e."</P>
<P>She &s;oon di&s;cerned his returning kind|ne&s;s, and it was a gentle tie that would have fa&s;tened her to the &s;pot where &s;he was, but for the firm re&s;i&s;tance of Mi&s;s Woodley.</P>
<P>"What will a few months ab&s;ence effect?" cried &s;he, pleading her cau&s;e, "At the end of a few months at far|the&s;t, he will expect me back, and where will be the merit in this &s;hort|&s;eparation?"</P>
<P>"In that time," replied Mi&s;s Wood|ley, "we may find &s;ome method to
<PB N="231" REF="243">
make it &s;till longer."&mdash;To this &s;he li&s;|tened with a kind of de&s;pair, but ut|tered &s;he "was re&s;igned;" and accord|ingly prepared for her departure.</P>
<P>Dorriforth was all anxiety that every circum&s;tance of her journey &s;hould be commodious; he was eager &s;he &s;hould be happy, and he was eager &s;he &s;hould &s;ee he entirely forgave her.&mdash;He would have gone part of the way with her, but for the extreme illne&s;s of lord Elm|wood, in who&s;e chamber he pa&s;&s;ed chief of the day, and &s;lept in Elmwood Hou&s;e every night.</P>
<P>On the morning of her journey, when Dorriforth gave his hand and conduct|ed Mi&s;s Milner to the carriage, all the way he led her &s;he could not re&s;train a flood of tears; which encrea&s;ed, as he
<PB N="232" REF="244">
parted from her, to convul&s;ive &s;obs.&mdash; He was affected; and notwith&s;tanding he had previou&s;ly bid her farewell, he drew her gently on one &s;ide and &s;aid, with his eyes moi&s;tened from regard of the mo&s;t laudable nature,</P>
<P>"My dear Mi&s;s Milner, we part friends?&mdash;I hope we do?&mdash;on my &s;ide, depend upon it, I regret nothing &s;o much at this &s;hort &s;eparation, as hav|ing ever given you a moment's pain."</P>
<P>"I believe &s;o." Was all &s;he could &s;ay, for &s;he ha&s;tened to break from him, le&s;t his di&s;cerning eye &s;hould di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the weakne&s;s which thus overcame her.&mdash;But her apprehen&s;ions were groundle&s;s; the rectitude of his own heart was a bar to the &s;u&s;picion of her's.&mdash;He once more kindly bade her adieu, and the carriage drove away.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="245">Mi&s;s Fenton and Mi&s;s Woodley ac|companied Mi&s;s Milner part of the journey, about thirty miles, where they were met by Sir Harry and lady Lune|ham.&mdash;Here was a parting nearly as af|fecting as that between her and her guardian. Mi&s;s Woodley, who for &s;e|veral weeks had treated her friend with a rigidne&s;s &s;he her&s;elf hardly &s;up|po&s;ed was in her nature, now bewailed her own &s;everity, begged her forgive|ne&s;s, promi&s;ed to corre&s;pond with her punctually, and to omit no opportu|nity of giving her every con&s;olation &s;hort of cheri&s;hing her fatal pa&s;&s;ion; but in that, and that only, was the heart of Mi&s;s Milner to be con&s;oled.</P>
