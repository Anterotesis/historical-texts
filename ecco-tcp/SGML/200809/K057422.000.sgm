<HEAD>On &s;eeing Mi&s;s YOUNGE in the Character of Lady FLIPPANT SAVAGE.</HEAD>
<L>THE two &s;cenic Mu&s;es had long kept a di&s;tance,</L>

<L>THALIA was pert, and MELPOMENE proud,</L>
<L>And though of admirers they both had a croud;</L>
<L>Not two rival beauties on earth could be &s;een</L>
<L>More tortur'd with jealou&s;y, envy and &s;pleen:</L>
<L>Till JOVE, to whom all the cele&s;tials &s;ubmit,</L>
<L>In matters of WEIGHT, or in matters of WIT,</L>
<L>Interpos'd his command, &s;aying, henceforth agree,</L>
<L>United in friend&s;hip as Si&s;ters &s;hould be;</L>
<L>And grant, as a pledge that your union's &s;incere,</L>
<L>Your mutual pow'rs to &s;ome favourite fair;</L>
<L>If one can be found among&s;t mortals below</L>
<L>De&s;erving the attributes you can be&s;tow.</L>
<L>The Si&s;ters obey'd; but unfix'd was their choice,</L>
<L>Till MINERVA appearing with &s;oul-moving voice:</L>
<L>While in &s;cales of &s;u&s;pen&s;e both their fancies were hung,</L>
<L>Appeal'd to their &s;en&s;es, and pointed to YOUNGE.</L>

<L>IN Shake&s;peare's days we only play'd the fool,</L>
<L>And men of fa&s;hion gave&mdash;not took&mdash;the rule;</L>
<L>Then Lords were grave, and ladies graver &s;till,</L>
<L>And only <HI>we,</HI> and clowns had wit at will;</L>
<L>His mind rejected former cla&s;&s;ic lore,</L>
<L>And drew from Nature's never-ending &s;tore.</L>
<L>But authors <HI>now</HI>&mdash;we often prove the fact,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t fa&s;hion court, to teach us how to act.</L>
<L>Expo&s;e the follies which our &s;tatutes &s;pare,</L>
<L>And unprotected Virtue make their care.</L>
<L>All nature <HI>now</HI> is <HI>cu&s;tom;&mdash;cu&s;tom, law</HI>;</L>
<L>And here we bring&mdash;not what we think,&mdash;but &s;aw.</L>
<L>Tis hard to vary your dramatic mirth,</L>
<L>When every folly gives it likene&s;s birth.</L>
<L>Which though, in life, your laugh they may command,</L>
<L>Will rather pall, than plea&s;e, at &s;econd hand.</L>
<L>'Tis harder &s;till to &s;uit the general mind,</L>
<L>And all our audience in our int're&s;t bind.</L>
<L>Hone&s;t John Bull, vex'd with the cares of life,</L>
<L>With heavy taxes and a &s;colding wife,</L>
<L>Wi&s;hes &s;ome hours in hearing us to wa&s;te,</L>
<L>And <HI>galloping dreary Dun</HI> is quite his ta&s;te.&mdash;</L>
<L>Sir Foppling too, his brains with claret addle,</L>
<L>Pronounces <HI>Comedy</HI> to be a <HI>Twaddle</HI>!</L>
<L>His Lord&s;hip by the privilege of folly,</L>
<L>Is neither mu&s;ical nor melancholy;</L>
<L>Thinks every hone&s;t bard <HI>a queer old Put,</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>"Damme! there's nothing in a play like <HI>&s;mut!</HI></L>
<L>The politician's all-commanding pate,</L>
<L>Would have us dramatize th' affairs of &s;tate:</L>
<L>Make whigs and tories fight, here face to face,</L>
<L>And teach the patriots, <HI>Unity of Place.</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>Some cry for &s;entiment, and &s;ome for wit,</L>
<L>And yet our claim to either won't admit.&mdash;</L>
<L>The Critic Bench!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Looking into the Pit.</NOTE> for which there's no appeal,</L>
<L>Since for the town they judge, and act, and feel.</L>
<L>Did you but know what pangs an author &s;hares,</L>
<L>How throbs his heart with anxious doubts and cares!</L>
<L>Let pa&s;t indulgence your attention keep:</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE To FASHIONABLE LEVITIES.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>(As &s;poken by Mi&s;s YOUNGE.)</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>OUR growing Levities too clearly &s;how,</L>
<L>That all our troubles from refinement flow.</L>
<L>Two ages &s;ince we valu'd plain attire,</L>
<L>Blue-apron'd was the Dame, &s;traight-hair'd the Squire;</L>
<L>They call'd not hou&s;hold bus'ne&s;s vulgar cares,</L>
<L>Nor deem'd it ungenteel to &s;ay their pray'rs:</L>
<L>But arts improv'd, new Levities aro&s;e,</L>
<L>And Ladies chang'd the fa&s;hion of their clothes;</L>
<L>Hoop'd petticoats in ev'ry town were &s;een:</L>
<L>The &s;nug rotunda pleas'd the virgin Queen,</L>
<L>And beef for breakfa&s;t &s;erv'd her Lady-train;</L>
<L>No wonder that her &s;ailors baffled Spain.</L>
<L>Yet &s;till we've chiefs with love of glory fir'd;</L>
<L>But &s;o had Rome when liberty expired;</L>
<L>"We've &s;tate&s;men too, who burn with patriots flame,</L>
<L>"But &s;o had Greece, when Greece had lo&s;t her fame."</L>
<L>"We've admirals who plow the briny deep,</L>
<L>"Through azure &s;kies and rolling clouds they &s;weep,</L>
<L>"Invade the Planets in an Air Balloon,</L>
<L>"And fright from her propriety the Moon"&mdash;</L>
<L>Be&s;s was a man, when danger call'd her pow'rs,</L>
<L>She was a woman in her private hours&mdash;</L>
<L>Few Levities, few luxuries &s;he knew;</L>
<L>No cherries then in February grew:</L>
<L>May-dukes in April on the bough hung green,</L>
<L>And girls wore hanging-&s;leeves till full eighteen.</L>
<L>Few mothers teach their daughters grace or &s;en&s;e&punc;</L>
<L>But tell them ta&s;te in dre&s;s is excellence:</L>
<L>Bid them the Levities of rank a&s;&s;ume,</L>
<L>And flaunt with &s;preading bow, or nodding plume;</L>
<L><PB REF="100">Strut in a riding-dre&s;s, to &s;hew their &s;hapes;</L>
<L>Or &s;talk in boots, and coats with tripple capes.</L>
<L>Affecting ea&s;e, but impudently free,</L>
<L>The matron leans upon her cici&s;bee;</L>
<L>While <HI>cara &s;po&s;a</HI> &s;nugly keeps his wench,</L>
<L>Defies his duns, and revels in the Bench.</L>
<L>"Why, this is vice, not folly?" I agree;</L>
<L>But &s;till this vice proceeds from Levity.</L>
<L>Some &s;ouls there are which moral &s;en&s;e &s;ublimes,</L>
<L>A few ble&s;t &s;pirits in the wor&s;t of times;</L>
<L>One in whom birth and piety are join'd;</L>
<L>Of native worth, and truly royal mind;</L>
<L>Who with benignant hand her ble&s;&s;ings pours;</L>
<L>Who knows no Levities, but feels for yours.</L>
