<P>THE author of HE'S MUCH TO BLAME is in &s;ome &s;mall degree indebted to Le Complai&s;ant, a comedy attributed to Mon&s;ieur De Ferriol Pont-de-Veyle, and to the tragedy of Clavigo by Goethe.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>PROLOGUES, in the&s;e &s;agacious days, mu&s;t not</L>
<L>Repeat the &s;tory; and betray the plot:</L>
<L>For deep laid plots we &s;ometimes have, no doubt:</L>
<L>'Tis pity you can't always find them out:</L>
<L>The &s;ecret mu&s;t be kept; and not be told:</L>
<L>In this, at lea&s;t, we beat the bards of old:</L>
<L>We can't endure our meaning you &s;hould gue&s;s,</L>
<L>And here again we boa&s;t complete &s;ucce&s;s:</L>
<L>Cautious le&s;t you the my&s;tery &s;hould di&s;cover,</L>
<L>We keep you in the dark&mdash;till all is over.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since the&s;e important points we mu&s;t not name,</L>
<L>The title let's di&s;cu&s;s: He's much&punc;to blame!</L>
<L>To blame? Ay, &s;urely; very much! But who.</L>
<L>The author. Well, that's nothing very new.</L>
<L>And what does blame induce? Why puni&s;hment.</L>
<L>Ra&s;hly we &s;in and lei&s;urely repent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lured by that tempting bait a nine nights' bonus,</L>
<L>The&s;e &s;cribbling &s;inners multiply upon us!</L>
<L>Then prologues write; to whine, cajole, and tickle:</L>
<L>Begging you'll burn the rod you've laid in pickle.</L>
<L>Shielding him&s;elf by the&s;e and &s;uch like arts,</L>
<L>He hopes to hurl with &s;urer aim his darts.</L>
<L>But &s;trike and cry, when we receive a blow,</L>
<L>Is arrant cowardice! I told him &s;o.</L>
<L>He's mad, who would the field of battle tread;</L>
<L>Unle&s;s he hoped to have a broken head.</L>
<L>There's honor in &s;uch &s;cars&mdash;he'll win and wear it&punc;</L>
<L>Then give him honor plenty! Never &s;pare it.</L>
<L>But, &s;hould it be your plea&s;ure not to quarrel,</L>
<L>He'll very kindly bear his load of laurel.</L>

It was but lately I di&s;covered what a wi&s;e man I am! And yet it &s;eems to me as if I were &s;carcely half wi&s;e enough, for I am told that I am to doubt of every thing which I find rather difficult. For ex|ample: that my wife Lady Vibrate is an extra|vagant rackety rantipole woman of fa&s;hion, can I doubt that? No. That &s;he &s;quanders my money, di&s;turbs my peace, and contradicts for contra|diction's &s;ake, can I doubt that? No. Then have I not a daughter to marry, a law &s;uit to begin, and a thou&s;and perplexing affairs &s;o that I do not know which way to turn? Why all this appears true to me: but the &s;ceptics teach that appearances deceive, and that nothing is certain. I may be Lord Vibrate, or I may be the Grand Turk.

my&s;elf ages of happine&s;s; and had cheri&s;hed a pa&s;&s;ion, impatient perhaps, but, ardent and pure as her own thoughts. This pa&s;&s;ion your conduct authorized. My fortune, my life, my &s;oul, were devoted to her. Mine was no light or wanton dalliance; nor did I expect a light and wanton conduct from the noble family of which your lord&s;hip is the head.</P>

<P>Not expre&s;sly, my lord. She referred me to time and you. 'Tis true I flattered my&s;elf her affections were wholly mine.

<P>I have been anxious for your coming. Your menace lives in my memory; and I &s;hall be glad to know the name of him who has threatened &s;uch mortal enmity.</P>

<P>About &s;ix years ago, a certain youth came up from college; poor, and unprotected. He was a &s;cholar, plea&s;ing in manner, warm and ge|nerous of temper, of a re&s;pectable family, and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the germ of every virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;ir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me on: my prai&s;es will not be te|dious. Chance made him known to a man who de&s;ired to cheri&s;h his good qualities; and the pur&s;e, the experience, and the power of his bene|factor, &s;uch as they were, he profited by to the utmo&s;t. Received as a &s;on, he &s;oon became dear to the family: but mo&s;t dear to the daughter of his friend; who&s;e tender age and glowing affections made her apt to admire the virtues &s;he heard her father &s;o ardently prai&s;e, and encourage. You are unea&s;y?</P>

<P>The a&s;&s;iduities of the youth to gain her

heart were unabating; and his preten&s;ions, poor and unknown as he then was, were not rejected. The noble nature of his friend &s;corned to make his poverty his crime. Why do you bite your lip? Was it not generous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><STAGE>(Firmly)</STAGE> Was it not?</P>

<P>Certainly! Nothing could&mdash;equal the&mdash;genero&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The health of his benefactor was declining fa&s;t; and the only thing required of the youth was that he &s;hould qualify him&s;elf for the cares of life, by &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion. He therefore entered a &s;tudent in the Temple; and the means were fur|ni&s;hed by his protector, till the end was obtained. Was not this friend&s;hip?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The lady, almo&s;t a child when fir&s;t he knew her, increa&s;ed in grace and beauty fa&s;ter than in years. Sweetne&s;s and &s;miles played upon her countenance. She was the delight of her friends, the admiration of the world, and the coveted of every eye. Lovers of fortune and fa&s;hion con|tended for her hand: but &s;he had be&s;towed her heart&mdash;had be&s;towed it on a&mdash;Sit &s;till, &s;ir; I &s;hall &s;oon have done. I am coming to the point. Five years elap&s;ed; during which the youth re|ceived every kindne&s;s friend&s;hip could afford, and every proof cha&s;te affection had to give. The&s;e he returned with promi&s;es and prote&s;tations that &s;eemed too va&s;t for his heart. I would &s;ay for his tongue&mdash;Are you unwell, &s;ir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on with your tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>His benefactor, feeling the hand of death &s;teal on, was anxious to &s;ee the two per&s;ons deare&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="84">
to his heart happy before he expired; and the marriage was determined on, the day fixed, and the friends of the family invited. The intended bridegroom appeared half frantic with his ap|proaching bli&s;s. Now, &s;ir, mark his proceeding. In this &s;hort interval, by &s;udden and unexpected deaths, he becomes the heir to a title and large e&s;tate. Well! Does he not fly to the arms of his langui&s;hing friend? Does he not pour his new trea&s;ures and his tran&s;ports into the lap of love? Coward and mon&s;ter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Both &s;tarting up)</STAGE> Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Viler than words can paint! Having robbed a family of honor, a friend of peace, and an angel of every human &s;olace, he fled, like a thief, and concealed him&s;elf from immediate con|tempt and vengeance in a foreign country. But contempt and vengeance have at length overtaken him: they be&s;et him: they face him at this in&s;tant. The friend he wronged is dead: but the &s;on of that friend lives, and I am he.</P>

<P>Forbear to interrupt me, &s;ir. You have nothing to plead, and much to hear. Fir&s;t &s;ay, did my &s;i&s;ter, by any improper conduct, levity of behaviour, or fault or vice whatever, give you ju&s;t cau&s;e to abandon her?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>None! None! Her purity is only ex|ceeded by her love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then how, barbarian, how had you the heart to di&s;grace the family and endanger the life of a woman who&s;e &s;anctified affection would have
<PB N="85" REF="85">
embraced you in poverty, pe&s;tilence, or death; and who, had &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed empires, would have be&s;towed them with an imperial affection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you a&s;k, Have I committed er|rors? call them crimes if you will, Yes. If you demand, Will I ju&s;tify them? No. If you re|quire me to atone for them, here is my heart: you have wrongs to revenge, &s;trike; and, if you can, inflict a pang greater than any it yet has known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ju&s;tice is not to be di&s;armed by being braved. To the que&s;tion. It can be no part of your intention, and certainly not of mine, that you &s;hould marry my &s;i&s;ter. Something very dif|ferent mu&s;t be done.</P>

Should I be the victor, flight, bani&s;hment from my native country, and the bittere&s;t recollec|tions of the villanies of man, mu&s;t be the fate of me and my &s;i&s;ter.

<P>Her name did e&s;cape his lips; but ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, and, if I rightly read his heart, emo|tions of the mo&s;t delicate &s;en&s;ibility immediately clo&s;ed them: as if he would not endure the love he bore her to be profaned by any the &s;lighte&s;t &s;emblance of barter and &s;ale.</P>
