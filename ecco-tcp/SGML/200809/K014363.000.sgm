<HEAD>A PLAIN AND SUCCINCT NARRATIVE OF THE DISTURBANCES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For Notes referred to in the Text, by Letters A B C, &amp;c. &s;ee the Appendix.</HEAD>
<P>THE late riots and popular tumults which have happened in the Metropolis and its environs, &s;ufficiently at the in&s;tant of their ex|i&s;tence, excited the apprehen&s;ions of all ranks of people, to awaken curio&s;ity and make a clear and &s;uccinct narrative worthy the acceptance of the public. To render the whole affair as intelligi|ble as po&s;&s;ible, it has been judged nece&s;&s;ary to trace the alledged cau&s;e of di&s;content, the Act for the relief of the Papi&s;ts, to its &s;ource. The original motion for the bill, which afterwards pa&s;&s;ed into a law, was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons by Sir George Savile: the object of it was, to repeal an act of the 10th and 11th of William the Third.
<PB N="8" REF="9">
The e&s;verity of this act may be gathered from the repealing act, an ab&s;tract of which is pre|fixed, and from the following ob&s;ervations of the members who introduced and &s;upported the bill.</P>
<P>Sir George Savile &s;tated, that one of his principle views in propo&s;ing this repeal was, to vindicate the honour and a&s;&s;ert the principles of the Pro|te&s;tant religion, to which all per&s;ecution was, or ought to be totally aver&s;e. That this pure reli|gion ought not to have had an exi&s;tence, if per|&s;ecution had been lawful. That it ill became us to practice that with which we reproached others. That he did not meddle with the va&s;t body of that penal code, but &s;elected that act on which he found mo&s;t of the pro&s;ecutions had been formed, and which gave the greate&s;t &s;cope to the ba&s;e views of intere&s;ted relations and un|principled informers. The act had not, it is true, been regularly put in execution, but &s;ometimes it had, and he under&s;tood that &s;everal Papi&s;ts lived in great terror, and &s;ome under actual contribution. He &s;tated the peaceable beha|viour of this part of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and mentioned the loyal and excellent addre&s;s they had lately pre&s;ented to the throne, in which, they not only expre&s;&s;ed their obedience to the Government under which they lived, but their attachment to the con&s;titution. As a guard and &s;ecurity however, he propo&s;ed, that a &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="9" REF="10">
te&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide ab&s;tract of the act, page 4.</NOTE>might be formed, by which they &s;hould bind them&s;elves to the &s;upport of the Civil Government as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The motion was &s;econded by Mr. Dunning, who with great ability entered into a legal di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of the principles, the objects, and the pa&s;t operations of the bill, which was moved to be repealed. Some of the &s;everities by him com|plained of were the following,&mdash;for Prie&s;ts or Je|&s;uits to teach or officiate in the &s;ervices of their church, were acts of felony in foreigners, and high trea&s;on in the natives of this kingdom. The forfeiture of e&s;tates to the next Prote&s;tant heir, the power given to a &s;on or other neare&s;t relation, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during the life of the proprietor, and the depriving of Papi&s;ts from acquiring any legal property by purcha&s;e, were, he &s;aid, exceedingly oppre&s;&s;ive, particularly the la&s;t clau&s;e, which had a far greater latitude than was under&s;tood, for it applied to all legal pro|perty acquired by other means than that of de&s;cent. He declaimed upon the horrid nature of that law, <HI>which deprived a Prie&s;t of liberty,</HI> only for officiating in the duties of his religion, and begged to remind the Hou&s;e, that even when the propo&s;ed repealing act had pa&s;&s;ed, the Prie&s;ts would not be at liberty to exerci&s;e their functions, but would &s;till, under the re&s;triction of former laws, be liable to a year's impri&s;on|ment,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
and the puni&s;hment of a heavy &s;ine. He ob&s;erved, that at the in&s;tigation of the mo&s;t abandoned of mankind, common informers, the magi&s;terial and judicial powers, were of nece&s;&s;ity bound to enforce all the &s;hameful penalties of the act. Others of the&s;e penalties, held out the mo&s;t powerful temptations for the commi&s;&s;ion of acts of depravity, at the very thought of which our nature recoils with horror. They &s;eem calculated to loo&s;en all bands of &s;ociety, to di&s;&s;olve all civil, moral, and religious obliga|tions and duties, to poi&s;on the &s;ources of do|me&s;tic felicity, and to annihilate every prin|ciple of honour. The encouragement given to children, to lay their hands upon the e&s;tates of their parents, and the re&s;titution which debars men from the hone&s;t acqui&s;ition of property, need, he &s;aid, in times like the&s;e, of philo&s;ophi|cal liberty, only be mentioned to excite the ut|mo&s;t indignation of that Hou&s;e. (A)</P>
<P>The motion was received with univer&s;al ap|probation, and a bill was accordingly brought in and pa&s;&s;ed without a &s;ingle negative.</P>
<P>The indulgencies granted by this act to the Papi&s;ts, &s;uch as, not only the free exerci&s;e of their religion in licen&s;ed chapels, equal to the Pre&s;byterians and all other Di&s;&s;enters and Sec|taries, but toleration likewi&s;e <HI>to e ect &s;chools</HI> for the education of youth in the Romi&s;h tenets,
<PB N="11" REF="12">
greatly alarmed many people, &s;ome on religious, and others on political principles. The re|&s;i&s;tance made to a &s;imilar act in favour of the Catholics in Scotland, (B) contributed to &s;pread the alarm, and bills were di&s;per&s;ed, and adver|ti&s;ements in&s;erted in the news-papers, inviting tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the cau&s;e, to unite un|der the title of the Prote&s;tant A&s;&s;ociation, and Lord George Gordon, who had been &s;o active at the head of the Malcontents in Scotland was cho&s;en pre&s;ident. Little notice was taken of the&s;e &s;ocieties, and the pre&s;ident, who&s;e eccen|tric and de&s;ultory character (C) and &s;peeches in the Hou&s;e of Commons were frequently the &s;ub|jects of ridicule, tended rather, both in and out of Parliament, to place tho&s;e objects, which, as it has proved, well de&s;erved the mo&s;t &s;erious at|tention, in a ludicrous than a &s;erious point of view. He has the manners and air of a mo|dern Puritan; his figure is meagre, his hair &s;trait and his dre&s;s plain. The &s;tile of the ad|verti&s;ements publi&s;hed in the name of the A&s;&s;o|ciating Committee, but which were &s;igned only by him, have the appearance of private ad|dre&s;&s;es to the public, and are &s;uch as might ra|ther have been expected from the famous Wil|liam Prynne, than from a noble Commoner in this philo&s;ophic age. The following is one of the&s;e adverti&s;ements, which at the &s;ame time that it affords a &s;pecimen of the &s;pirit and &s;tile, in which the&s;e invitations were written, will &s;hew
<PB N="12" REF="13">
by what means the attention of the people was engaged, and their minds were incited to a con|&s;ideration of the tendency of the repealing act, and which only became &s;erious in the opinion of the liberal, from the encouragement and pro|tection it gave the Papi&s;ts in the <HI>erecting of &s;chools.</HI></P>

<P>THIS is to give notice, That in compliance with a petition addre&s;&s;ed to the Pre&s;ident, the Committee have re&s;olved that there &s;hall be an|other general meeting of the Prote&s;tants before the London petition is pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>

<P>All the true friends of Great Britain, and of civil and religious liberty, are exhorted to unite in &s;upport of the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t before it is too late; for unanimity and firmne&s;s in that glorious cau&s;e can alone protect us from the <HI>dangerous confederacy of Popi&s;h powers.</HI> If we unite, like one man, for the honour of God, and the liberties of the people, we may yet experi|ence the ble&s;&s;ing of Divine Providence on this

Lord George had frequently &s;poken in terms which &s;eemed intended to intimidate the Hou&s;e of Commons; and, in order to &s;hew that he was more in earne&s;t, and had more power than they believed, he took every method to incite the public attention. A report was circulated that he had a&s;&s;erted he would not pre&s;ent the Petition, unle&s;s he was attended by <HI>forty thou&s;and</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Another account &s;ays 20,000.</NOTE>of the A&s;&s;ociators at the lea&s;t. Every one who wi&s;hed well to the cau&s;e, was de&s;ired to appear with a blue cockade in his hat. The A&s;&s;ociators &s;e|parated them&s;elves into four grand divi&s;ions, as reque&s;ted in the adverti&s;ement; the London, the We&s;tmin&s;ter, the Southwark, and the Scotch; and flags were provided for each.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on Friday, June the 2d, at ten in the forenoon, an immen&s;e concour&s;e a&s;&s;embled at the place appointed, &s;ome with &s;erious inten|tions, &s;ome with wicked, and others out of cu|rio&s;ity: and, notwith&s;tanding the inten&s;e heat, which was, that day, very remarkable, kept pa|rading the fields with their flags, &s;inging hymns, mar&s;halling them&s;elves in ranks, and waiting for their leader. About eleven o'clock, Lord George arrived among them, and gave directions in what manner he would have them proceed, and about twelve, (that the whole city might be convinced how &s;erious the people were in their demands) one numerous party was ordered to go round over London Bridge, another over Blackfriars,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
and a third to follow him over We&s;tmin&s;ter. A huge roll of parchment, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or rather &s;everal rolls in one.</NOTE>too, almo&s;t as much as a man could carry, containing the names of tho&s;e who had &s;igned the Petition, was borne be|fore them. They proceeded with great decorum and decency on their route, and the whole body was a&s;&s;embled, about half pa&s;t two, before both Hou&s;es of Parliament, on which occa&s;ion they gave a general &s;hout.</P>
<P>But however peaceable and well di&s;po&s;ed &s;ome of them might be it was very evident, from the habit and appearance of numbers among&s;t them, that order and regularity were not long to be ex|pected from &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly; on the contrary, they &s;oon began to exerci&s;e the mo&s;t arbitrary and dictatorial power over both Lords and Com|mons. They obliged almo&s;t all the Members to put blue cockades in their hats, and call out, "No Popery!" Some they compelled to take oaths to vote for the repeal of the obnoxious act&punc; and others they in&s;ulted in the mo&s;t indecent and violent manner. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues from the outer door to the very door of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which they twice at|tempted to force open. The like attempt was made at the Hou&s;e of Lords; but by the exer|tion of the door-keepers, and the care of Sir Francis Molyneux, it did not &s;ucceed. The Archbi&s;hop of York was one of the fir&s;t they at|tacked. As &s;oon as his coach was known com|ing
<PB N="17" REF="18">
down Parliament-&s;treet, he was &s;aluted with hi&s;&s;es, groans, and hootings; and when he got out of his carriage, to avoid greater mi&s;chief, was obliged to &s;ay (which he did in a pitiable and enfeebled voice) "No Popery, no Popery!" The Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council, Lord Bathur&s;t, they pu&s;hed about in the rude&s;t man|ner, and kicked violently on the legs. Lord Mansfield had the gla&s;&s;es of his carriage broken, the pannels beat in, and narrowly e&s;caped with life. The Duke of Northumberland was ex|ceedingly ill treated, and had his pocket picked of his watch. The Bi&s;hop of Litchfield had his gown torn. The wheels of the Bi&s;hop of Lincoln's carriage were taken off, and his Lord|&s;hip might be &s;aid to e&s;cape per&s;onal injury al|mo&s;t by miracle. (D)</P>
<P>The Lords Town&s;hend and Hill&s;borough came together: the latter, who was known by the mob, was mo&s;t gro&s;ly in&s;ulted, and had not &s;ome of them been partial to Lord Town&s;hend, would, in all probability, have been much more &s;o: as it was, they were both much hu&s;&s;eled and pu&s;hed about, and &s;ent into the Hou&s;e without their bags, and with their hair hanging loo&s;e on their &s;houlders. The coach of Lord Stormont was broken to pieces, and him&s;elf in the hands of the mob for near half an hour, during which time they took the mo&s;t in&s;olent liberties with him, and pelted him with mud: he was re&s;cued
<PB N="18" REF="19">
at la&s;t by a gentleman who harangued the mob, and prevailed on them to de&s;i&s;t. Lords A&s;h|burnham and Bo&s;ton were treated not only with mo&s;t unwarrantable indignity, but with a mer|cile&s;s and unmanly &s;everity, particularly Lord Bo&s;ton, who was &s;o long in their power that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary by the Peers to go as a body and endeavour, by their pre&s;ence, to extri|cate him, but were prevented by the entrance of his Lord&s;hip, out of breath and in great di&s;|order, with his coat all powdered and his hair di&s;heveled. The front gla&s;s of Lord Trentham's vis &acirc; vis was broken, and him&s;elf in&s;ulted and detained a con&s;iderable time. Lord Willough by de Broke, Lord St. John, Lord Dudley, and many others, were per&s;onally ill treated; and Wellbore Ellis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was obliged to take refuge in the Guildhall of We&s;tmin&s;ter, (whither he was pur&s;ued) the windows of which were broke, the doors forced, and Ju&s;tice Addington, with all the con&s;tables, expelled&punc; Mr. Ellis e&s;caped at the utmo&s;t hazard, and after exceedingly &s;evere and rough treatment.</P>
<P>The behaviour of Lord George Gordon was &s;uch as might be expected. He came &s;everal times to the top of the gallery &s;tairs, whence he harangued the people, and let them know the bad &s;ucce&s;s their Petition was like to meet with. He told them fir&s;t, that it was propo&s;ed to take it into con&s;ideration on Tue&s;day in a Committee
<PB N="19" REF="20">
of the Hou&s;e, but that he did not like delays, for the Parliament might be prorogued by that time.</P>
<P>He came once more, and &s;aid he &s;aw little rea|&s;on to hope redre&s;s from the deci&s;ions of Parlia|ment&mdash;that they &s;hould meet again&mdash;that they ought not to de&s;pair, but to put their tru&s;t in Providence.</P>
<P>He came a third time, and &s;aid, "Gentlemen, the alarm has gone forth for many miles round the city. You have got a very good Prince, who as &s;oon as he &s;hall hear the alarm has &s;eized &s;uch a number of men, will no doubt &s;end down private orders to his Mini&s;ters to enforce the prayer of your Petition."</P>
<P>When the mob was raging and roaring in the lobby, General Conway &s;at him&s;elf down by Lord George, and addre&s;&s;ed him to the following purpo&s;e: "My Lord, I am a military man, and I &s;hall think it my duty to protect the freedom of debate in this Hou&s;e by my &s;word; you &s;ee, my Lord, the Members of this Hou&s;e are this day all in arms. Do not imagine that we will be over|powered or intimidated by a rude, undi&s;ciplined, unprincipled rabble. There is only one entry into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and that is a narrow one. Reflect, that men of honour may defend this pa&s;s;&mdash;and that certainly many lives will be lo&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="21">
before we will &s;uffer our&s;elves to be overawed by your adherents. I wi&s;h, in one word, my Lord, to know whether it is your intention to bring tho&s;e men, who&s;e wild uproar now &s;trikes our ears, within the walls of this hou&s;e?" Soon after General Conway had done &s;peaking with Lord George, Colonel Gordon, a near relation of his Lord&s;hip's, went up to him, and acco&s;ted him in the following manner: "My Lord George, do you intend to bring your ra&s;cally adherents into the Hou&s;e of Commons? If you do,&mdash;the fir&s;t man of them that enters, I will plunge my &s;word not into his, but into your body."</P>
<P>Lord George, it is &s;aid, was very much di&s;|mayed by what had fallen from General Conway, and his kin&s;man, Colonel Gordon, and it was in con&s;equence of what they had threatened, that he came to the top of the gallery &s;tairs, and de&s;ired the populace to be quiet, and to tru&s;t to the goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e, and to his Ma|je&s;ty's clemency and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>While his Lord&s;hip was making his &s;econd &s;peech, one of his relations, General Grant, came behind him, and by a gentle violence en|deavoured to draw him back into the Hou&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aid to him, "O Lord George, Lord George! for God's &s;ake, Lord George! do not lead the&s;e poor people into any danger."&mdash;His Lord&s;hip, however, made the General no an&s;wer, but con|tinued
<PB N="21" REF="22">
his harangue&mdash;"You &s;ee, &s;aid he, in this effort to per&s;uade me from my duty, before your eyes, an in&s;tance of the difficulties I have to encounter with from &s;uch wi&s;e men of this world as my honourable friend behind my back."</P>
<P>Alderman Sawbridge and others endeavoured to per&s;uade the people to clear the lobby, but to no purpo&s;e; and about nine o'clock, different Members conjured them in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and pathetic manner to di&s;per&s;e, informing them at the &s;ame time of their danger, and of the re&s;o|lution that was taken to &s;end for the Guards. The young gentleman, the A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Chaplain of the Hou&s;e of Commons, addre&s;&s;ed them, but gained nothing except cur&s;es, and "You be damned! Lord George Gordon for|ever!" &s;oon after this, a party of Hor&s;e and Foot Guards arrived. Ju&s;tice Addington was at the head of the Hor&s;e, and was received with a volley of hi&s;&s;es; but on his a&s;&s;uring the peo|ple that his di&s;po&s;ition towards them was per|fectly peaceable, and that he would order the &s;oldiers away, if they would give their honour to di&s;per&s;e, he gained their good will. Accord|ingly the Cavalry galloped off, and upwards of &s;ix hundred of the Petitioners, after giving the Magi&s;trate three cheers, departed from thence.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the day the attention of the Hou&s;e of Commons had been taken up in
<PB N="22" REF="23">
debates concerning the Mob. When they had obtained &s;ome degree of order, Lord George in|troduced his bu&s;ine&s;s with informing them, that he had before him a Petition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Note F.</NOTE>&s;igned by near one hundred and twenty thou&s;and of his Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, praying "A Repeal of the Act pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion in favour of the Ro|man Catholics," and moved to have the &s;aid Pe|tition brought up.</P>
<P>Mr. Alderman Bull &s;econded the motion, and leave was accordingly given.</P>
<P>Having brought up the Petition, his Lord&s;hip then moved to have it taken into immediate con|&s;ideration, and was again &s;econded by Mr. Al|derman Bull.</P>
<P>After &s;ome debate, the Hou&s;e divided, and there appeared &s;ix for the Petition, and one hundred and ninety-two again&s;t it. Soon after this the Hou&s;e adjourned, and the mob having di&s;per&s;ed from the avenues of both Hou&s;es, the Guards were ordered home.</P>
<P>But though order and tranquility were re-e&s;tab|li&s;hed in this part of the town, it was far other|wi&s;e el&s;ewhere. The Mob had paraded off in dif|ferent divi&s;ions from Palace Yard, and (whether in&s;tigated by religious phrenzy or de&s;igning men, time alone can di&s;cover) as a prelude to the hor|rid
<PB N="23" REF="24">
deva&s;tations which were to follow, went &s;ome of them to the Romi&s;h Chapel in Duke-&s;treet, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and others to that in War|wick-&s;treet, Golden-&s;quare, both of which they in a great mea&s;ure demoli&s;hed. The military were &s;ent for with the utmo&s;t expedition to both places, but could not arrive time enough at either to prevent the mi&s;chiefs. Tho&s;e who had the command of the military were very cautious of proceeding to extremities, much &s;cuffling en|&s;ued, and &s;ome few were &s;lightly wounded with the bayonets. Thirteen of the rioters were taken, and the mob, for that night, di&s;per&s;ed without any farther mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of this evening's di&s;turbance may be &s;aid, to be only the beginning of tho&s;e dreadful &s;cenes of de&s;olation which have &s;ince en&s;ued; and which when the perpetrators are long &s;unk into oblivion, &s;hall be recorded as &s;ome of the mo&s;t unparalleled and daring out|rages hi&s;tory can furni&s;h.</P>
<P>The riots which were &s;o alarming on Friday evening partly &s;ub&s;ided on the Saturday, and the peaceable part of the inhabitants imagined it was nothing more than the intemperate fury of a few mi&s;guided zealots, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e mi&s;|creants, who always mingle with the mob, who&s;e trade is plunder, and who are therefore continually active in all &s;cenes where tumult and
<PB N="24" REF="25">
anarchy prevail. But this was by no means the ca&s;e, for on Sunday in the afternoon, the rioters a&s;&s;embled in large bodies, and attacked the chapels and dwelling-hou&s;es of the Catho|lics in and about Moorfields. They &s;tript their hou&s;es of furniture, and their chapels not only of the ornaments and in&s;ignia of religi|on, but tore up the altars, pulpits, pews, and benches, and made huge fires of them, leaving nothing but the bare walls, and in many places not even them. They publicly avowed their intention to root out Popery, to relea&s;e tho&s;e who had been confined in Newgate for their pro|ceedings at the Sardinian and Warwick &s;treet chapels on Friday, to pull down the hou&s;es of the ju&s;tices who committed them, and the per&s;ons who gave evidence again&s;t them like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>On Monday the mobs collected again, and be|came more formidable. They began to put their threats in execution in different quarters of the town. Some paraded with the reliques of havock, which they collected in Moorfields, as far as Lord George Gordon's hou&s;e, in Wel|beck-&s;treet, and afterwards burnt them in the adjacent fields. Another party went to Virginia|lane, Wapping, and a third to N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ghtingale-lane, Fa&s;t Smithfield, where they &s;everally de&s;troyed the Catholic Chapels, and committed other outrages. They &s;eemed to have been mar&s;halled
<PB N="25" REF="26">
out, and different bodies di&s;patched on the&s;e infernal errands. Mr. Rainsforth, tallow-chand|ler, of Stanhope-&s;treet, Clare-market, and Mr. Maberly of Little Queen-&s;treet, Lincoln's Inn|fields, who had appeared as evidences on the examination of tho&s;e who had been committed, had each of them their hou&s;es, &s;hops, &amp;c. &s;tript, or as they wantonly termed it, gutted, and the contents committed to the flames. Sir George Savile's hou&s;e in Leice&s;ter-fields underwent the &s;ame fate, his crime was preparing and bring|ing the bill into Parliament in favour of the Ca|tholics. Happily for Sir George he had pru|dently removed his plate and &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable of his furniture, and other effects, in a private manner.</P>
<P>This day al&s;o, which was held as the Anni|ver&s;ary of the King's birth-day, a Proclama|tion was i&s;&s;ued, promi&s;ing a reward of five hun|dred pounds, to tho&s;e who would make di&s;co|very of the per&s;on or per&s;ons concerned in de|moli&s;hing and &s;etting fire to the Sardinian and Bavarian Chapels. The per&s;ons formerly ap|prehended, too, were re-examined, and &s;ome were di&s;charged, while others were ordered to Newgate, whither they were e&s;corted by a party of the Guards, whom, on their return, the mob had the in&s;olence to pelt. One of the &s;oldiers who had been hurt by a &s;tone, turned and pre|&s;ented his piece; but the commanding officer
<PB N="26" REF="27">
humanely ordered him not to fire; and the &s;ol|diers were obliged to make a ha&s;ty retreat.</P>
<P>All ranks of people began to be exceedingly terrified at the lawle&s;s proceedings of this day; and numbers put blue cockades in their hats, (al|though it might now be &s;aid to be the en&s;ign of rebellion,) on purpo&s;e to avoid per&s;onal injury and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>We now come to that period of de&s;olation and de&s;truction, when every man began to tremble, not only for the &s;afety of the city, but for the con&s;titution, for the kingdom, for property, li|berty and life, for every thing that is dear to &s;o|ciety, or to Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day all the military in town were or|dered on duty at the Tower, both Hou&s;es of Par|liament, St. James's, St. George's Fields, &amp;c. during the day. Notwith&s;tanding every precau|tion, Lord Sandwich was wounded in attempt|ing to go down to the Parliament Hou&s;e to at|tend his duty, his carriage demoli&s;hed, and him|&s;elf re&s;cued by the military with difficulty. The hou&s;e of Lord North was attacked, and only pre&s;erved by the exertion of a party of Light Hor&s;e, who rode over, and wounded with their &s;words, &s;everal of the a&s;&s;ailants.</P>
<P>About &s;ix in the evening one party went to the hou&s;e of Ju&s;tice Hyde, near Leice&s;ter Fields,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
which they de&s;troyed in le&s;s than an hour; ano|ther, &s;hortly after, paraded through Long Acre, down Holborn, &amp;c. till they came to Newgate, and publicly declared they would go and relea&s;e the onfined Rioters. When they arrived at the doors of the pri&s;on, they demanded of Mr. Aker|man the keeper, to have their comrades imme|diately delivered up to them; and upon his per|&s;i&s;ting to do his duty, by refu&s;ing, they began &s;ome to break the windows, &s;ome to batter the doors and entrances into the cells, with pick-axes and &s;ledge-hammers, others with ladders to climb the va&s;t walls, while others collected fire|brands, and whatever combu&s;tibles they could find, and flung into his dwelling hou&s;e. What contributed more than any thing to the &s;preading of the flames, was the great quantity of hou&s;e|hold furniture belonging to Mr. Akerman, which they threw out of the windows, piled up again&s;t the doors, and &s;et fire to; the force of which pre&s;ently communicated to the hou&s;e, from the hou&s;e to the chapel, and from thence&punc; by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mob, all through the pri&s;on. A party of Con&s;tables, nearly to the amount of a hundred, came to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the keeper; the&s;e the Mob made a lane for, and &s;uffered to pa&s;s till they were entirely encircled, when they attacked them with great fury, broke their &s;taffs, and converted them into brands, which they hurled about wherever the fire, which was &s;preading very fa&s;t, had not caught. It is
<PB N="28" REF="29">
almo&s;t incredible to think that it were po&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy a building of &s;uch amazing &s;trength and extent, with &s;o much &s;wiftne&s;s as they accom|pli&s;hed this. As &s;oon as the flames had de&s;troy|ed Mr. Akerman's hou&s;e, which was part of Newgate, and were communicated to the wards and cells, all the pri&s;oners, to the amount of three hundred, among whom were four under &s;entence of death, and ordered for execution on the Thur&s;day following, were relea&s;ed. The acti|vity of the Mob was in this in&s;tance, as well as every other, amazing. They dragged out the pri|&s;oners, many of them, by the hair of the head, by the legs or arms, or whatever part they could lay hold of: They broke open the doors of the different entrances, as ea&s;ily as if they had all their lives been acquainted with the intricacies of the place, to let the confined e&s;cape. Great numbers were let out at the door that leads to the Se&s;&s;ion's Hou&s;e; and &s;o well planned were all the ma|noeuvres of the&s;e de&s;perate ruffians, that they had placed centinels at the avenues, to prevent any of the pri&s;oners from being conveyed to other jails. Thus was the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t durable pri&s;on in England, that had been newly erected, and was not yet fini&s;hed, and in the building of which the nation had expended im|men&s;e &s;ums demoli&s;hed, the bare walls excepted, which were too thick and &s;trong to yield to the force of &s;ire, in the &s;pace of a few hours.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">
Even this was but a moiety of the mi&s;chief of this terrible night. Not &s;atiated with the de&s;truction of this great building, a party was &s;ent among the Catholics in Devon&s;hire-&s;treet, Red Lion-&s;quare; another to the hou&s;e of Ju&s;tice Cox in Great Queen-&s;treet, which was &s;oon de|&s;troyed; a third broke open the doors of the New Pri&s;on, Clerkenwell, and turned out all the confined; a fourth de&s;troyed the furniture and effects, writings, &amp;c. of Sir John Fielding; and a fifth de&s;perate and infernal gang went to the elegant hou&s;e of Lord Mansfield, in Bloom&s;|bury-&s;quare, which they, with the mo&s;t unre|lenting fury, &s;et fire to and con&s;umed. The lo&s;s here was immen&s;e, both to Lord Mansfield as an individual, and to the public. A mo&s;t valuable collection of pictures, &s;ome of the &s;carce&s;t manu&s;cripts &s;aid to be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any private per&s;on in the world, with all his Lord&s;hip's notes on great law ca&s;es, and the con|&s;titution of England, were all &s;acrificed by mad|men and villains; and Lord and Lady Mans|field were with difficulty pre&s;erved from their rage, by making their e&s;cape through a back door, a few minutes before the&s;e mi&s;creants broke in and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e. The military was &s;ent for, but arrived too late; they were obliged, however, to fire in their own de|fence, and &s;ix men and a woman were killed, and &s;everal wounded. Not contented with the havock and de&s;truction they had been guilty of
<PB N="30" REF="31">
in Bloom&s;bury, they went from thence to his Lord&s;hip's country &s;eat at Caen Wood, which would certainly have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, had not they been repelled by a party of Hor&s;e which had been &s;ent thither for the pre&s;ervation of this delightful place. The inhabitants were obliged this night to illuminate their windows.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to give any adequate de&s;cription of the events of Wedne&s;day. Notice was &s;ent round to the public pri&s;ons of the King's Bench, Fleet, &amp;c. by the Mob, at what time they would come and burn them down. The &s;ame kind of infernal humanity was exerci&s;ed towards Mr. Lang|dale, a di&s;tiller in Holborn, and &s;everal other Ro|mi&s;h individuals. Three boys went through the &s;treets, and in particular down Holborn, in the middle of the day, with iron bars, got from the railing before Lord Mansfield's hou&s;e, extorting money at every &s;hop huzzaing and &s;houting, "No Popery!" and though numbers were pa&s;|&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing, the inhabitants dur&s;t not re|fu&s;e them money; nor dur&s;t any body attempt to &s;ecure them, to have them puni&s;hed. Small parties of the like daring nature were formed in other parts, and the whole city was laid under contribution. One man in particular was mounted on hor&s;eback, and refu&s;ed to take any thing but gold. Two men in the broad day, not contented with the former mi&s;chief, got in|to Mr. Mabberly's hou&s;e in Queen-&s;treet, and
<PB N="31" REF="32">
&s;taid for upwards of an hour knocking down the wain&s;coting, and every bit of wood work they could, with &s;afety to them&s;elves; and though a great many peaceable well dre&s;&s;ed people looked on, no one mole&s;ted them. In the afternoon all the &s;hops were &s;hut, and bits of blue &s;ilk, by way of flags, hung out at mo&s;t hou&s;es, with the words, "No Popery," chalked on the doors and window &s;hutters, by way of deprecating the fury of the in&s;urgents, from which no per&s;on thought him&s;elf &s;ecure.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the day was drawing towards a clo&s;e, one of the mo&s;t awful and dreadful &s;pec|tacles this country ever beheld was exhibited. The mob had not only declared their re&s;olution of firing the pri&s;ons, and &s;ome private hou&s;es, but had avowed their intention to de&s;troy the Bank, Gray's Inn, Temple, Lincoln's Inn, the Grand Ar&s;enal at Woolwich, and Royal Palaces. A univer&s;al &s;tupor had &s;eized the minds of men: They looked at one another, and waited with a re&s;igned con&s;ternation for the events which were to follow. Government indeed had exerted it|&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, as far as their power, under the direction of the civil magi&s;trate, would ex|tend. Now, however, it was become nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of the royal prerogative, and give di&s;cretionary powers to the military. Nothing could convey a more awful idea of the mi&s;chief which was dreaded, than the &s;trong guard which
<PB N="32" REF="33">
was placed in the Royal Exchange for the pro|tection of the Bank, as nothing perhaps could have equalled the national de&s;olation, had the diabolical purpo&s;es of the in&s;urgents upon this place &s;ucceeded. Be&s;ides this, &s;oldiers were di&s;tributed at Guildhall, in the Inns of Court, in almo&s;t every place tenable as a fortification, and in &s;ome private hou&s;es; and the cannon was di&s;po&s;ed to the be&s;t advantage in the Park.</P>
<P>With minds thus predi&s;po&s;ed to terror by &s;o many objects of deva&s;tation, and in a city which but a few days before enjoyed the mo&s;t perfect tranquility, let tho&s;e who were not &s;pectators judge what the inhabitants felt when they be|held at the &s;ame in&s;tant the flames a&s;cending and rolling in va&s;t and voluminous clouds from the King's Bench and Fleet Pri&s;ons, from New Bridewell, from the Toll gates on Blackfriars Bridge, from hou&s;es in every quarter of the town, and particularly from the bottom and middle of Holborn, where the conflagration was horrible beyond de&s;cription. The hou&s;es that were fir&s;t &s;et on fire at this la&s;t mentioned place, both belonged to Mr. Langdale, an emi|nent di&s;tiller, and contained immen&s;e quantities of &s;pirituous liquors. It is ea&s;y to conceive what fury the&s;e would add to the flames; but to form an adequate idea of the di&s;tre&s;s of the neighbouring inhabitants, or indeed of the in|habitants in every part of the city, is not &s;o ea&s;y.
<PB N="33" REF="34">
Men, women, and children were running up and down with beds, gla&s;&s;es, bundles, or whatever they wi&s;hed mo&s;t to pre&s;erve. In &s;treets where there were no fires, numbers were remov|ing their goods and effects at midnight. The tremendous roar of the in&s;atiate and innumera|ble fiends who were the authors of the&s;e horrible &s;cenes, was heard at one in&s;tant, and at the next the dreadful report of &s;oldiers mu&s;kets, as if firing in platoons, and at various places; in &s;hort, every thing which could impre&s;s the mind with ideas of univer&s;al anarchy, and approaching de|&s;olation, &s;eemed to be accumulating. Sleep and re&s;t were things not thought of; the &s;treets were &s;warming with people, and uproar, confu|&s;ion, and terror reigned in every part.</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to collect, in one point of view, the havock of this night; had half the mi&s;chief the Mob had threatened been effected, nothing le&s;s than national bankruptcy and de|&s;truction could have en&s;ued: that they were pre|vented at tho&s;e places, on the &s;afety of which the very exi&s;tence of the empire might be &s;aid to depend, was owing not to their want of will but power, and to the exertion of Government. They made two attempts upon the Bank; but were &s;o much intimidated by the &s;trength with which they beheld it guarded, that their attacks were but feebly conducted. They were led on to the fir&s;t by a brewer's &s;ervant on hor&s;eback, who
<PB N="34" REF="35">
had decorated his hor&s;e with the chains of New|gate; but were repul&s;ed at the fir&s;t fire from the Military, and their &s;econd &s;ucceeded no better. They made an effort to break into the Pay Office likewi&s;e, and met the &s;ame fate. Several of them fell in the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, and many more were wounded, as the importance of the&s;e places made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew but little lenity.</P>
<P>The Regulars and Militia had poured in &s;o fa&s;t, in con&s;equence of the expre&s;&s;es di&s;patched for that purpo&s;e, that the citizens on Thur&s;day began to recover from a con&s;ternation in which many of them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e duty it was to have taken the mo&s;t active part po&s;&s;ible, had been di&s;gracefully &s;tupified. They were, however, &s;o thoroughly alarmed, and &s;o much affected by the depredations they beheld on every &s;ide, that the &s;hops were univer&s;ally &s;hut from Tyburn to Whitechapel, and no bu&s;ine&s;s of any kind, except at the Bank, was tran&s;acted; and here, the run, in&s;tead of being greater than ordi|nary, was near 80,000l. le&s;s, a proof that the arrival of the troops had quieted their fears.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the number of un|happy and deluded wretches who lo&s;t their lives on the la&s;t dreadful night; but it is a con&s;ola|tion that very few innocent people, or people of credit, a Banker's Clerk excepted, were among the killed. The e&s;cape of one young lad, though
<PB N="35" REF="36">
perhaps he might not de&s;erve &s;o good a fate, me|rits, from its &s;ingularity, a place in this Narration. While the Fleet Pri&s;on was burning, the Mob had the audacity, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ence of the Military, to cut the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pes from, and to&s;s into the flames, a large engine which had been brought to play upon the contiguous buildings. The &s;oldiers were thereupon ordered to di&s;per&s;e them. Among others, there were four people &s;eated upon the roof of the Market-hou&s;e, who refu&s;ed to obey the Military, and who were therefore ordered to fire. The di&s;charge of the mu&s;kets came from three directions, in the front, and at each &s;ide, &s;o that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible for any one to e&s;cape, and for a con&s;iderable time they all four lay dead, as was &s;uppo&s;ed. At length, however, one of them was ob&s;erved to rai&s;e his head a little, and in&s;tantly clap it down and lay &s;till again; he repeated this manoeuvre two or three times, till at la&s;t he ventured to &s;lide down, and ran away with great celerity. He was by far the genteele&s;t in appearance of the four. The three were &s;hot dead at the in&s;tant, and two were on one &s;ide of him, and one on the other. One of the dead was a chimney-&s;weeper, about &s;ixteen years old, and had forty guineas in his pockets.</P>
<P>The toll-gates at Black friars appear to have been burnt for the &s;ake of the plunder: there were &s;ome lives lo&s;t there too, and one man who was
<PB N="36" REF="37">
&s;hot, ran thirty or forty yards before he dropped, as appears by the blood which may be traced in pla&s;hes on the pavement.</P>
<P>But powder and ball do not &s;eem to have been &s;o fatal to them as their own inordinate ap|petites. Numbers, it is &s;aid, and at various places, died with inebriation, e&s;pecially at the di&s;tilleries of the unfortunate Mr. Langdale, from who&s;e ve&s;&s;els the liquor ran down the middle of the &s;treet, was taken up by pailfuls, and held to the mouths of the be&s;otted multitude; many of whom killed them&s;elves with drinking non-recti|fied &s;pirits, and were burnt or buried in the ruins. Eight or nine of the&s;e mi&s;erable wretches have been found and dragged out. (I) The &s;ame &s;cenes of bea&s;tly drunkenne&s;s happened in many other places; at Mr. Cox's, at Lord Mansfield's, where an ill-looking fellow, about nineteen, that was wounded, and had his hair clotted with blood, was too drunk, at one o'clock the next day, to be made &s;en&s;ible; at Newgate likewi&s;e many of them had made &s;o free with the liquor that they could not get away, and were burnt in the cells. In the &s;treets men were lying upon bulks and &s;talls, and at the doors of empty hou&s;es, drunk to a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, and to a con|tempt of danger: boys and women were in the &s;ame condition, and many of the latter with in|fants in their arms.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
There were &s;ix and thirty (K) fires all blazing at one time, and all to be &s;een from one &s;pot, made from the furniture of the inhabitants, and the wrecks of their hou&s;es in and about the neigh|bourhood of Queen-&s;treet and little Ru&s;&s;el-&s;treet, Bloom&s;bury. A per&s;on who &s;tood and beheld this &s;cene with horror, &s;aid to the Officer who was there with a party of &s;oldiers, that he thought a deal of the mi&s;chief might be prevent|ed, as the perpetrators appeared chiefly to be boys. This di&s;cour&s;e was overheard by another per&s;on, a well dre&s;&s;ed decent-looking man, who damned the &s;peaker's blood and bade him get home to bed.</P>
<P>But tho' centinels were po&s;ted at every avenue, and every &s;hop was &s;hut, tho' the whole city had the appearance of a place that every moment ex|pected to be &s;tormed, and was &s;o well defended that nothing le&s;s than a regular army could have endangered it, yet the inhabitants could by no means per&s;uade them&s;elves they were entirely &s;ecure. Not only were their doors all &s;crawled with chalk, intimating that they were no Papi&s;ts, and their windows decorated with blue flags or ribbands, but the very Jews, in Hound&s;ditch and Duke's Place, were &s;o terri|fied that they followed the general example, and, unintentionally, gave an air of ridicule to what they under&s;tood in a very &s;erious light, by writing
<PB N="38" REF="39">
on their &s;hutters, "This hou&s;e is a true Pro|te&s;tant."</P>
<P>The Military were exceedingly active all the day, and &s;ecured great numbers of the di&s;order|ly; fifty were taken in the Cells of Newgate attempting to rekindle the fire in tho&s;e few parts, which on account of the va&s;t extent of the building, had not been totally de&s;troyed. It is remarkable that &s;everal of the pri&s;oners who had been relea&s;ed by the mob, had &s;o great an affection for tho&s;e &s;cenes to which they had been long accu&s;tomed, that they could not forbear loitering about the Cells, and coming to view them, and were accordingly retaken. Many others were found &s;auntering near their old haunts in Cloth Fair, Black Boy Alley, Gravel Lane, &amp;c. by the thieftakers, and re-committed by the magi&s;|trates. Every hour brought intelligence of the ap|prehending of &s;ome of the in&s;urgents, as all &s;u&s;pi|cious per&s;ons were examined, and all hackney|coaches, &s;tages, and other vehicles, &s;earched. An attack was this day made upon the Mar&s;hal|&s;ea Pri&s;on by the Rioters, but they were repelled.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed citizens relieved in part from one fear, than they were invaded by another. They beheld, as before related, the Royal Exchange, the Bank, the Inns of Court, every place in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an arm|ed force. Their lives and property were the

moment before at the mercy of a lawle&s;s and unprincipled rabble. Their rights, their liber|ties, the con&s;titution of England, objects of &s;till greater con&s;equence, dearer even than life and property, were now at the di&s;po&s;al of the Court. In &s;uch colours, however, did the unu&s;ual objects which every where met their eyes paint things to their imaginations&punc; They &s;aw &s;oldiers, without the lea&s;t ceremony, &s;top whoever they plea&s;ed, and no one dur&s;t re&s;i&s;t: they were &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of &s;uch mea&s;ures, yet &s;ighed at that nece&s;&s;ity, and trembled for their freedom. Tho&s;e virtuous citizens, who held their country and their laws &s;uperior to every thing, who reflected on and rejoiced at the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, and groaned at the appearance only of de&s;poti&s;m, had their terrors greatly increa&s;ed at a report, which every where prevailed, that Martial Law was proclaimed.

<P>Convinced as they were that it was unavoid|able, there was not a word in the latter part of the above Proclamation that did not carry a wound to the heart of every thinking and virtu|ous Engli&s;hman. Martial Law was not, it is true, immediately and rigorou&s;ly enforced, they did not hang delinquents in the &s;treets without form or proce&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though even this was <HI>reported,</HI> a man was &s;aid to be hanging upon a lamp iron in Cheap&s;ide&punc; on Thur&s;day in the afternoon, and &s;ix more, the &s;ame account added, were to &s;uffer the following morning at Whitehall.</NOTE>, but they <HI>had</HI> di&s;cretionary powers to bayonet or &s;hoot. No abu&s;e of the&s;e a&s;&s;umed and delegated powers had been exhibit|ed; but the po&s;&s;ibility of abu&s;e, the being but an hour under the controul of a Military Force, was humiliating, derogatory, and alarming. (L)</P>
<P>While an exact &s;tate of the fears of all good patriots is related, it is but ju&s;tice to give Go|vernment prai&s;e for the proper u&s;e they made of the power they were thus obliged to u&s;urp. No part of their conduct reflects greater honour on
<PB N="42" REF="43">
them than the publication of the following hand-bill, if it were done by their direction, which was generally under&s;tood. Numerous copies of them were given away on Thur&s;day, and the whole tenor of it &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifies what has been a&s;&s;erted, and what mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly was &s;everely felt, and &s;eriou&s;ly thought upon, viz. that the Con&s;titution was endangered.</P>
<P>"Whereas &s;ome ill-de&s;igning and malicious per&s;ons have publi&s;hed, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;|quieting the minds of his Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ub|jects&punc; That it is intended to try the pri&s;oners, now in cu&s;tody, by martial law; Notice is given, by authority, that no &s;uch purpo&s;e or intention has ever been in the contemplation of govern|ment; but that the &s;aid pri&s;oners will be tried by the due cour&s;e of law, as expeditiou&s;ly as may be."</P>
<P>This account of the public attention to their rights is nece&s;&s;arily a part of the Narrative; and is, be&s;ides, due to tho&s;e who, in times of tumult and di&s;order like the&s;e &s;poken of, had fortitude and virtue enough not to be &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed as to forget that which con&s;titutes the greate&s;t be&s;&s;ing upon earth. It affords this in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on likewi&s;e: that it is the duty of good citizens, who have a real, and not merely a verbal love for their country and freedom, to think &s;eriou&s;ly of e&s;tabli&s;hing that kind of police which &s;hall
<PB N="43" REF="44">
enable them to defend them&s;elves, without the aid of powers which may, &s;ometimes, be turned to their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Another very proper hand-bill was circulated, and which it is probable was done by the Pro|te&s;tant A&s;&s;ociation. The following is a copy.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>IT is earne&s;tly reque&s;ted of all peaceable and well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, <HI>(as well Prote&s;tants a&s;&s;ociated as others)</HI> that they will ab&s;tain from wearing BLUE COCKADES, as the&s;e en&s;igns are now a&s;&s;umed by a &s;et of mi&s;creants, who&s;e purpo&s;e it is to burn this city, and plunder its inhabitants; and who wi&s;h, by di&s;tributing among&s;t better-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, and prevailing on them to wear the&s;e marks and di&s;tinctions, to &s;creen them&s;elves from the dete&s;tation and puni&s;hment due to their enormous crimes.</P>
<P>And it is farther recommended to all trade&s;|men and ma&s;ters of families, not to employ or retain in their &s;ervice any per&s;ons who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by wearing blue cockades.</P></Q>
<P>It is now time to relate another part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which has claimed the attention of &s;ome politicians who pretend to &s;ee farther into latent cau&s;es than the bulk of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
The mi&s;chief which had been perpetrated, and that which was evidently intended, were of &s;o black an a&s;pect, and involved &s;o entirely the de&s;truction of the empire, that the mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, and tho&s;e who were lea&s;t liable to be perverted by idle conjecture, could not help &s;ometimes think|ing they &s;aw a wicked head directing the violent and rude hands of the mob. The univer&s;al de|&s;truction of the pri&s;ons was a va&s;t project; but &s;uch a one as was not altogether improbable to be a favourite &s;cheme with a lawle&s;s rabble. Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes examples of the like. But no hi&s;tory can parallel the depth of their &s;chemes upon the Bank, the Trea&s;ury, and the demolition of the water-works, thereby to prevent the ex|tingui&s;hing any conflagration they had begun; and that the&s;e &s;chemes were not the chimeras of fear, were evident. A &s;trong guard was &s;ent to the New River head, and continued there on con&s;tant duty. Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e, the grand Ar&s;enal at Woolwich, the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, the Inns of Court, and many other places of the greate&s;t national concern, were devoted, and there was &s;carce a per&s;on on the Thur&s;day but was unanimous in &s;uppo&s;ing the de&s;olation of the city and country was intended. Another hand|bill, be&s;ides tho&s;e already in&s;erted, was di&s;tribut|ed, which perhaps might take its ri&s;e from the general opinion; but which, however, tended to give that opinion &s;trength. It was as follows:</P>

<HEAD>NO FRENCH RIOTERS.</HEAD>
<P>This is to give notice, that it now appears, that the horrible Riots which have been com|mitted in this city have been promoted by French money, and to call upon all hone&s;t men to &s;tand forth again&s;t Rioters, who under the cloak of Religion, are wantonly de&s;troying our property, and endeavouring to over&s;et our hap|py con&s;titution. If the French are &s;uffered by the&s;e means to prevail, Popery will certainly be introduced, which we have no rea&s;on to fear from a Briti&s;h Parliament.</P>
</DIV1>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Still farther to confirm the&s;e conjectures, the New&s;papers of Friday gave accounts of loui&s;|d'ors being found upon &s;ome of the Rioters who had been killed or taken; and what at la&s;t en|tirely gave it credit, was the apprehending, ex|amination, and commitment of Lord GEORGE GORDON. He was conducted to the Tower on Friday evening, under a remarkably &s;trong guard, &s;aid to be far the mo&s;t numerous that ever e&s;corted a State Pri&s;oner. A large party of infantry was in the front. His Lord&s;hip follow|ed in a coach, in which were two officers. Two &s;oldiers rode behind the coach, which was imme|diately followed by General Carpenter's regiment of dragoons. After this, came a Colonel's guard of the Foot Guards; and a &s;trong party of Militia marched on each &s;ide of the carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
This tran&s;action rung through London, and &s;o entirely was he deemed the original Author, and promoter of the Riots, that few were found to pity him. A thou&s;and &s;urmi&s;es were circu|lated, &s;uch as, `whether religion, avarice, or ambition, was the motive that had prompted him in the action, whether France, (M) or any foreign powers had been abettors; and others of the like nature, equally, at pre&s;ent, vague and indeter|minate. This much however, ought in ju&s;tice to Lord George to be ob&s;erved, that it is appa|rent from what has hitherto tran&s;pired, that he has been actuated rather by a wrong head, than a wicked heart. No better account of the whole affair for the pre&s;ent than the following, which is copied from the public prints, can be procured.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance that fir&s;t induced the Mem|bers of Admini&s;tration to turn their thoughts towards taking the Noble Patron of the Prote&s;|tant Rioters into cu&s;tody, is &s;aid to be this&mdash;Lord George, in the heat of his too &s;ucce&s;sful enthu&s;ia&s;m, wrote a letter, which he &s;ent for in|&s;ertion to the conductor of a Morning Publica|tion, addre&s;&s;ed to his religious A&s;&s;ociates, wherein he recommended them to nouri&s;h the noble &s;pi|rit that had &s;o laudably taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and told them that he did not in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree doubt that an unlimited compliance with all their requi&s;itions would be the undoubted con&s;equence of their per&s;everance. He at the
<PB N="47" REF="48">
&s;ame time indeed annexed a kind of exhortation for the pre&s;ervation of peace and good order; but as this concluding &s;ugge&s;tion was too repug|nant to the general tenour of the epi&s;tle, and al|&s;o far too faintly urged to produce an adequate effect, the Printer very judiciou&s;ly deemed it the be&s;t &s;tep he could take for the welfare and quiet of his country, to &s;end the Copy of this Letter to Government, which he accordingly did, in a note addre&s;&s;ed to Lord Hill&s;borough. His Lord|&s;hip, immediately on the receipt of the Letter, cau&s;ed a Council to be convened, before whom he produced it. The unanimous opinion they held upon it was, that it was of a very inflam|matory tendency, and that the Author was un|doubtedly amenable to the laws, as the Promoter of a traitorous and uncon&s;titutional &s;edition. As a farther &s;anction, however, for the mea&s;ures they intended to adopt towards him&punc; an order was immediately i&s;&s;ued to the Po&s;t Office, en|joining all letters franked <HI>G. Gordon,</HI> to what|ever quarter they might be addre&s;&s;ed, to be from that time detained, and tran&s;mitted to the office of one of the Secretaries of State. In con&s;e|quence of this mandate, &s;everal letters, written by the deluded young Nobleman&punc; were &s;topped, and afterwards laid before the Cabinet. Mo&s;t of the&s;e were directed to Scotland, and were re|plete with ob&s;ervations equally &s;ubver&s;ive of order, religion, and liberty. He gave a faith|ful narrative of the tran&s;actions which had taken
<PB N="48" REF="49">
place in the Metropolis; and in&s;tead of accom|panying the relation with tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of horror and di&s;approbation which mu&s;t have actuated every good and well-di&s;po&s;ed citizen, he &s;eemed rather to exult in the event, as no|thing pervaded the&s;e epi&s;tles but rapturous en|comiums on the "glorious cau&s;e," and extrava|gant panegyrics on the noble &s;pirit di&s;played by his Brethren in the defence of it. The uniform tendency of all the&s;e different letters &s;ufficiently determined the Cabinet as to the propriety, and indeed nece&s;&s;ity, of making the Author of them pri&s;oner; and orders were immediately given for that purpo&s;e. He was fir&s;t brought before the Council a&s;&s;embled at St. James's, where he was examined concerning the purport of his va|rious epi&s;tles, and particularly interrogated as to the nature of his own de&s;igns and motives in writing them. He di&s;claimed all intentions of violating the public peace, and expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t attachment for the love of his country, but at the &s;ame time vindicated his adherence to the cau&s;e he was concerned in with a&s;toni&s;hing ability and re&s;olution. To the que&s;tion, how|ever, which was frequently and forcibly put, by different members of the Cabinet, how he could &s;o far forget his dignity, as an immediate de|&s;cendant of one of the fir&s;t families of his coun|try, and al&s;o a legi&s;lator of England, as to unite with a &s;et of the lowe&s;t men in the kingdom, and to be in&s;trumental in producing the &s;hock|ing
<PB N="49" REF="50">
di&s;orders and irreparable injuries which had taken place? he only &s;everally replied, "That he had not fore&s;een tho&s;e effects in all the de|grees to which they had extended; that he did not mean them; and was &s;orry for them." But again&s;t this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> was urged, "Why did he, in all his letters, convey an implied approbation of the&s;e di&s;turbances, if &s;uch was his di&s;po&s;ition of mind as he there repre&s;ented?" His Lord&s;hip made no good an&s;wer to this ob&s;ervation. After he had undergone an examination of upwards of an hour at St. James's, he was taken to the Hor&s;e Guards, where Lord Amher&s;t &s;at in his capacity of Commander in Chief, and proceeded to a farther &s;crutiny into this dark and diabolical bu&s;ine&s;s. Here more te&s;timony appeared; &s;e|veral per&s;ons were brought who &s;wore to certain expre&s;&s;ions of a mo&s;t inflammatory tendency indeed, which had been u&s;ed by his Lord&s;hip on the day when the petition was originally pre&s;ent|ed to the Hou&s;e of Commons; his haranguing the Mob from the lobby of the Hou&s;e was dwelt upon, and his expre&s;&s;ions with re&s;pect to Mr. Burke particularly &s;worn to. His preparations for an immediate departure into Scotland, as &s;oon as ever the po&s;&s;ibility of farther mi&s;chief was precluded by the interpo&s;ition of the mili|tary, was al&s;o proved as a collateral corrobora|tion of the nature of his views; and about eight o'clock his examination finally clo&s;ed, with a full conviction on the minds of the auditors, that

<P>On Wedne&s;day evening the Rev. B. Allen was robbed in the &s;treet, oppo&s;ite Mr. Langdale's di&s;tillery, Holborn-bridge, between eight and nine o'clock by a gang of pick-pockets, &s;ome of whom forcibly held him whil&s;t his pockets were picked of a gold French made watch, &s;eals, &amp;c. a pur&s;e with two guineas and a half, his keys, and other articles;&mdash;his pockets were turned in&s;ide out. A per&s;on decently dre&s;&s;ed held his cane, and returned it very civilly when the affair was over.</P>
<P>Three or four &s;everal times during the general conflagration at Mr. Langdale's, &amp;c. a &s;ingle fellow, with a blue cockade and a bludgeon, demanded money for the gang, threatening tho&s;e who made the lea&s;t he&s;itation, in Bedford&punc;row, and the adjacent &s;treets; and &s;o terrified were the inhabitants, his demands were complied with. But a &s;tronger proof &s;till of the infatuation of the mob, who concluded they had effected the total &s;ubver&s;ion of order, was the following. On Saturday, when every place was guarded, and all things peaceably &s;ettled in their former channel, a man had the temerity

<P>During the fir&s;t days of the commotion, parties of &s;oldiers were continually di&s;patched to the aid of the Civil Magi&s;trates, but the&s;e &s;eem &s;trangely to have neglected their duty.

<P>In con&s;equence of the complaint made by Lord Vi&s;count Beauchamp again&s;t the Lord Mayor, for inactivity during the late riots, and particularly during the time of the fire in Moor|fields, the Lord Mayor was ordered to attend a meeting of the Privy Council, on Friday even|ing.

<HEAD>ANECDOTES <HI>of the Life of</HI> LORD GEORGE GORDON. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In ju&s;tice to the author, it is mentioned that the&s;e anecdotes are by another per&s;on.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>LORD George Gordon is third &s;on to the late Duke of Gordon. He was born in London, about the year 1747 or 1748, and en|tered at an early age into the navy. He ro&s;e to the rank of Lieutenant, and there, owing to &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t or di&s;appointment, he gave up his commi&s;&s;ion. His enemies take occa&s;ion to &s;ay that he retired becau&s;e Lord Sandwich would not grant a very imprudent reque&s;t which he made for a &s;hip, on the moment of his having procured a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e; they &s;ay that he threatened the Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, to throw him&s;elf into the arms of the Oppo&s;ition if he did not comply with his demand, and on his Lord&s;hip's refu&s;al, that he actually did take a decided part again&s;t Mini&s;ters, and by that means quarrelled with the Duke, his brother. His friends give a very different account of this bu&s;ine&s;s. They &s;ay, that from his earlie&s;t years he expre&s;&s;ed a very zealous, if not a violent at|tachment to the Con&s;titution of this country, and though of an amorous complexion, that he paid his court to her as his darling mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Having while a Mid&s;hipman been in America, he had conceived a very particular affection for
<PB N="60" REF="61">
the inhabitants, and when the ruinous mea&s;ures were pur&s;uing in Parliament, which terminated in the di&s;memberment of the empire, he took a decided part again&s;t Mini&s;ters from conviction, and not from di&s;appointment. Having done this, and thereby had a temporary di&s;agreement with the Duke, his brother, he had no rea&s;on to believe that Lord Sandwich would permit him to ri&s;e in the way of his profe&s;&s;ion; and he left a &s;ervice in which, in the pre&s;ent day of degene|racy and corruption, men ri&s;e by intere&s;t, and not by merit.</P>
<P>No man had ju&s;ter preten&s;ions to independ|ance, though few perhaps in the Hou&s;e were poorer than Lord George Gordon. He has pre&s;erved through life the mo&s;t guarded and de|cent oeconomy, and with an income of between 7 and 800l. a year has maintained his integrity firm and inviolate, notwith&s;tanding the attacks which Mini&s;ters have from time to time made upon it. One of their practices, his Lord|&s;hip, with indignant &s;pirit, publi&s;hed in the Hou&s;e; Lord North, he &s;aid, had been guilty of an <HI>infamous</HI> attempt to bribe him with a place of a 1000l. a year, to give up his &s;eat in Parlia|ment. This charge the Mini&s;ter received with a di&s;torted face; he denied that he had been guilty of an <HI>infamous</HI> attempt, but he never intended to di&s;prove the charge. This &s;tory is differently told. It is &s;aid that the Duke, his brother, made
<PB N="61" REF="62">
application to the Mini&s;ter for his place, and there were &s;everal interviews between them on the &s;ubject. The place was promi&s;ed to his Lord&s;hip with the condition of his giving up his &s;eat, and on this ground the treaty was broke off.</P>
<P>The part that his Lord&s;hip has taken in re|gard to the Prote&s;tant A&s;&s;ociation is too recent in the minds of men to require recapitulation. He did not take an active part in oppo&s;ition to the Bill in favour of the Papi&s;ts, at the time of its pa&s;&s;ing; becau&s;e, as his Lord&s;hip &s;ays, "he had not then become a &s;peaker." We are well a&s;&s;ured that his Lord&s;hip had no idea of produ|cing the dreadful con&s;equences that en&s;ued from a&s;&s;embling the A&s;&s;ociation. He was well con|vinced, at the &s;ame time, that unle&s;s the Peti|tion of the Prote&s;tants was &s;trengthened by an A&s;&s;ociation, there was no rea&s;on to apprehend that any regard would be paid to it. The mea&s;ures which he advi&s;ed and adopted, were founded on his knowledge of the venality of Parliament; and his wor&s;t enemies mu&s;t ac|knowledge that he has acted openly and candidly throughout the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. He gave the Hou&s;e to under&s;tand that 150,000 men had de|termined to have the Act repealed; nay, he even proceeded &s;o fairly, as to move in his place, that 100,000 &s;tand of arms, firelocks, bayonets, and accoutrements might be tran&s;mitted to Scot|land, to enable them to put them&s;elves in array
<PB N="62" REF="63">
and accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e. The noble Lord has, through life, maintained the character of a facetious companion. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great fund of wit, and humour, and his temper is withal &s;o &s;weetened with the quality of good nature, that he has never been known to &s;acrifice it at the &s;hrine of &s;atire. For the whole of this &s;ea&s;on no man has been more univer&s;ally attended to in the Hou&s;e than his Lord&s;hip; and he has &s;aid &s;ome of the &s;evere&s;t, and at the &s;ame time the wittie&s;t things again&s;t both &s;ides of the Hou&s;e, that have been uttered in St. Stephen's &s;ince the day of the celebrated Charles Town&s;hend: And &s;hould his Lord&s;hip fall a &s;acrifice to his zeal on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, no man ever received a greater &s;hare of public re&s;pect, than his Lord|&s;hip will no doubt meet with.</P>

<P>MR. Thurloe (the pre&s;ent Lord Chancellor) &s;poke to the Bill. The purport of his &s;peech was, that though he did not mean to oppo&s;e it, he would recom|mend caution.

<P>The Bi&s;hop of Peterborough (in the upper Hou&s;e) ob|&s;erved that the Bill ought to have been introduced at an earlier part of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, by which means the di&s;po&s;ition of the nation towards it might have been known; and that it was not only worthy their Lord&s;hips' attention to look into the real &s;ecurity of the Con&s;titution, but to prevent alarms of imaginary danger with which ig|norance and malice heretofore had kindled, and might again kindle flames which the authority of the law might find it difficult to extingui&s;h.</P>

<P>That it is with the deepe&s;t concern they petition the Hou&s;e again&s;t a law which has lately received the Royal A&s;&s;ent; but as this Act is &s;o &s;uddenly introduced, and &s;o ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed, before the &s;en&s;e of the nation at large could be obtained, or any oppo&s;ition formed again&s;t it, they are encouraged to hope that this application will not prove too late for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>That, notwith&s;tanding the late Act might be in|tended to repeal only detached parts of a &s;ingle &s;tatute, your Petitioners conceive that it is an ab&s;olute repeal of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential clau&s;es in that &s;tatute, and will operate, virtually, to render tho&s;e Acts again&s;t the Papi&s;ts that are yet unrepealed of no effect.</P>

<P>LORD Mansfield has given the doctrine of Military interference an explanation as unexpected as it is new. He has con&s;idered them, not as &s;oldiers, but citizens; amenable to the Civil Magi&s;trate for their conduct; and having a right to act, in all ca&s;es of tumult, like pa&s;|&s;engers, or other per&s;ons. The Public &s;eem, unhappily, to have acquie&s;ced, and taken his Lord&s;hip's word for demon&s;tration. The doctrine is &s;pecious, and its novel|ty, joined to his Lord&s;hip's reputation, have given it the force of truth: but, if it is con&s;titutional, the dif|ference between the Government of England and a Mi|litary one is imperceptible. A &s;oldier, who is merely pa&s;&s;ing, is in a very different legal &s;ituation to a &s;oldier under arms, called forth to act offen&s;ively and defen&s;ively: it would &s;eem &s;trange to hang that man for murder who only obeyed the word of command.

<P>IT was not 'till this morning, that a publication, un|der your name, fell into my hand; "A Narrative of the late Riots;' which is penned with a candor and im|partiality that a&s;&s;ure me, you would be de&s;irous to cor|rect any a&s;&s;ertion to the di&s;advantage of others, into which you have been mi&s;led either by ignorant or preju|diced mi&s;information.</P>
<P>In the 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d page of your Pamphlet is the following paragraph. <Q>It would be wrong to forget the Armed A&s;&s;ociations, who turned out on Thur&s;day, though &s;ome have accu&s;ed them of being very quiet and peace|able till the danger was all over.</Q></P>
<P>In the foregoing paragraph it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h between two di&s;tinct particulars: in the fir&s;t &s;entence,
<PB REF="73">
you &s;eem to expre&s;s &s;ome favourable &s;entiments, of your own, towards the behaviour of the Armed A&s;&s;ociations; and, in the &s;econd, relate only the remarks which others made on their conduct at the late intere&s;ting cri&s;is.</P>
<P>As a Volunteer in the London Military A&s;&s;ociation of Foot, I think it incumbent on me to inform you, that on the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> afternoon we made a tender of our &s;ervices to the Lord Mayor of London. Before the hour of &s;even, <HI>the &s;ame evening,</HI> we were under arms, and con|tinued &s;o all night, in the &s;ame duty with the Regulars; fir&s;t protecting the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, then marching to &s;uch other parts of the City as were actually attacked. Before four in the morning, we had &s;ecured the Rioters in the hou&s;e of Mr. Donovan, in Broad &s;treet&punc; and &s;aved the hou&s;e of his neighbour, Mr. Gorman, from the ruin to which it had been devoted; though not without the painful nece&s;&s;ity of committing &s;ome execution on tho&s;e who were not, by repeated intreaties, to be per&s;uaded to de&s;i&s;t and di&s;band.</P>
<P>Very little enquiry would fully a&s;&s;ure you, that the &s;ervices of the Armed A&s;&s;ociations were vigorou&s;ly ex|erted, and unremittedly continued, from the moment the Civil Magi&s;trate could be depended on not to &s;uffer them to &s;tand the defencele&s;s victims of that outrage and abu&s;e, which they had, with indignation, &s;een the Mili|tary expo&s;ed to in the preceding &s;tages of the late horrid &s;cenes of brutality and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Regulars were not permitted to do any actual &s;ervice till the <HI>Wedne&s;day evening,</HI> and from that very hour, the London Military A&s;&s;ociations kept even pace with them, in every endeavour for the pre&s;ervation of the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of the community, from the ruin with which they were threatened.</P>

<P>GREAT care has been taken relative to the authen|ticity of facts. Some have unavoidably been &s;e|lected from the <HI>public papers,</HI> but &s;uch as nobody contra|dicts, &s;ome <HI>the author</HI> can atte&s;t, and others were collected from <HI>&s;pectators</HI> of undoubted veracity.</P>
<P>A &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion was fixed upon the mind of the Narra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or, by being pre&s;ent at many of tho&s;e &s;cenes of horror he has undertaken to de&s;cribe: an effort has been made to convey them as they were univer&s;ally felt, but that is next to impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who, in the mid&s;t of uproar and di&s;traction, compo&s;es a Narrative, and gives it in the form of a &s;mall pamphlet, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to write for &s;ame; but he may be &s;trongly affected by private and public di&s;tre&s;s: he may &s;igh with a weak and &s;ickly mother, driven from her habitation at midnight, with all her little ones, terrified and crying, around her: he may groan for a mad, mi&s;guided multitude; to&s;&s;ing the brands of de|&s;truction on the head of innocence, and expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to pre&s;ent, or to future death: he may weep over the ruins of a city, and at the de&s;olation of its innocent inhabitants.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is worthy the talents of the able&s;t hi&s;|torian: the dignity and ca&s;e of one is little expected in this kind of publication.</P>
<P>If the Author has communicated ideas, &s;o as to im|pre&s;s a <HI>faint</HI> image of that horror and dete&s;tation which every good citizen experienced, who was pre&s;ent at the perpetration of the&s;e lawle&s;s acts, he has effected more than he hoped. Such hope is now only in&s;pired by the favourable reception the Public gave to the fir&s;t Edition.</P>
