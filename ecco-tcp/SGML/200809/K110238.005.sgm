<P>BEFORE you proceed with my letter, Fairfax, read the inclo&s;ed pa|per <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A copy given by Anna to Clifton, as &s;he had promi&s;ed him, of all that &s;he had &s;aid in her la&s;t conver&s;ation.</NOTE>!&mdash;Read!&mdash;The hand-writing is
<PB N="2" REF="3">
hers!&mdash;It is addre&s;&s;ed to me! Was repeated to me! Is tran&s;cribed for me!&mdash;Tran&s;cribed by her&s;elf!&mdash;Read! And if it be po&s;&s;ible believe in your own exi&s;tence! Believe if you can that all you &s;ee, all you hear, the images that &s;wim before your eyes and the world it&s;elf are real, and no delu&s;ion!&mdash;For my part I begin to doubt!&mdash;Read!&mdash;Oh that I were invi&s;ible and &s;tanding by your &s;ide!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>Well!&mdash;Have you ended?&mdash;And do you &s;till continue to breathe?&mdash;Are you not a &s;tatue?&mdash;Would not the whole univer&s;e denounce me liar if, knowing me, I were to tell it that words like the&s;e were not only &s;poken to me but are
<PB N="3" REF="4">
written, le&s;t I &s;hould forget the mad|dening injuries they contain?&mdash;What! Make me her confe&s;&s;or?&mdash;Me?&mdash;No &s;ecret &s;in, of thought, word, or deed, concealed!&mdash;All remembered, all re|cited, all avowed!&mdash;Sins committed with the hated Henley!&mdash;Sins again&s;t love, again&s;t Clifton!&mdash;Does &s;he ima|gine I can look on a paper like this and, while my eye &s;hoots along the daring the in&s;ulting line, not feel all the fires that now devour me?&mdash;Surely &s;he is fran|tic!</P>
<P>The&s;e things, Fairfax, are above my comprehen&s;ion! My amazement mu&s;t be eternal, for I never &s;hall be able to under&s;tand them.&mdash;What! Tell me, Clifton, of her amorous debates with &s;uch a fellow? Appoint him her head|u&s;her
<PB N="4" REF="5">
over me? Announce him my rival? Meet my eye unaba&s;hed and affirm him to be my &s;uperior? Inform me of the deep hold he has taken of her heart? Own &s;he ki&s;&s;ed him?</P>
<P>Once again it is incredible! Nay mo&s;t and &s;till more incredible; for, &s;trange to &s;ay and yet more &s;trange for her to do, even this received &s;uch a var|ni&s;h from her lips, her eyes, her beauties, her irradiating zeal, that rea&s;on everla&s;t|ingly renounce me if I &s;carcely knew, while &s;he &s;poke, whether it were not the hi&s;tory of &s;ome &s;ylph, &s;ome heavenly &s;pirit &s;he was reciting?</P>
<P>Yes, Fairfax! There was a moment, a &s;hort but dangerous moment, at which &s;o charmed was I by her eloquence, &s;o amazed by her daring &s;incerity, &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="6">
moved by the white candour of a &s;oul &s;o &s;eeming pure, that, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by I know not what booby devil of genero|&s;ity, I was on the point of throwing my|&s;elf at her feet, confe&s;&s;ing the whole guilt of my intents, and proclaiming my&s;elf her true and irrevocable con|vert!</P>
<P>And this before the breath that ut|tered the&s;e injuries was cold!</P>
<P>The &s;iren!&mdash;All the beauteous witcheries that ever yet were &s;aid or &s;ung do not equal her!&mdash;Circe, Calyp&s;o, Morgana, fairy or godde&s;s, mortal or immortal, knew not to mix the magic cup with &s;o much art!</P>
<P>Not that it was her arguments. What are they? It was her bright her beam|ing eyes, her pouting beauteous lips,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
her palpitating ec&s;tatic bo&s;om, her&mdash;I know not what, except that even this was not all!&mdash;No!&mdash;There was &s;omething &s;till more heavenly!&mdash;An emanating deity!&mdash;The cele&s;tial effulgence of a divine &s;oul, that flowed with fervour almo&s;t convul&s;ive!</P>
<P>Had you witne&s;&s;ed her elevated a&s;pi|rations!&mdash;Such &s;welling pa&s;&s;ions &s;o ma&s;|tered, &s;o controlled, till then I never be|held! Like the &s;low pau&s;e of the &s;olemn death-bell, the big tear at &s;tated pe|riods dropped; but dropped unheeded. Though &s;he could not exclude them, her &s;toic &s;oul di&s;dained to notice &s;uch intru&s;ive gue&s;ts!&mdash;Her whole frame &s;hook with the warfare between the feel|ings and the will&mdash;And well might it &s;hake!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
I went prepared, and lucky it was that I did. My fixed determination was to be &s;ilent, that I might profit by what I &s;hould hear. That one dangerous mo|ment excepted, I was firm!&mdash;Firm!&mdash;Not to be moved; though rocks would, had they li&s;tened!</P>
<P>Yes, Fairfax, I did my part. Not that I am certain that to fall at her feet like a canting methodi&s;t, own my&s;elf the mo&s;t reprobate of wretches, whine out repentance, and implore forgivene&s;s at the all &s;ufficient fountain of her mercy would not be the very way to impo&s;e upon her be&s;t.</P>
<P>I begin indeed to be angry at my&s;elf for not having yet re&s;olved on one con|&s;i&s;tent plan. Schemes &s;o numerous pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, and none without its
<PB N="8" REF="9">
difficulties and objections, that to deter|mine is no ea&s;y ta&s;k. Circum&s;tances in part mu&s;t guide me. I mu&s;t have patience. At pre&s;ent I can only pre|pare and keep in readine&s;s &s;uch cum|brous engines as this phlegmatic foggy land of beef and pudding can afford. I mu&s;t &s;upply the fire, if I find it nece&s;&s;ary to put the machines in motion.</P>
<P>But, having decreed her fall, my &s;pi|rits are now alert, and there is not a be|ing that &s;urrounds me to whom imagi|nation does not a&s;&s;ign a po&s;&s;ible part: and that the part &s;hould be well-&s;uited to the per&s;on mu&s;t be my care.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t exerci&s;e mu&s;t be on my&s;elf. Apathy or the affectation of apathy mu&s;t be acquired&mdash;Inevitably mu&s;t be&mdash;My pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be ma&s;ked: I mu&s;t pre|tend
<PB N="9" REF="10">
to have conquered them. In their naked and genuine form they are inde|cent, immoral, impure, I know not what! But catch a metaphy&s;ical quirk, and let vanity and dogmatic a&s;&s;ertion &s;tand &s;pon&s;ors and baptize it <HI>a truth,</HI> and then raptures, extravagance, and bi|gotry it&s;elf are deities! Be then as loud, as violent, as intolerant as the mo&s;t ran|corous of zealots, and it is all the &s;ub|lime ardour of virtue.</P>
<P>Yes! I mu&s;t learn to ape their con|tempt of all and every terrene object, motive, and re&s;pect!</P>
<P>Inclo&s;e the &s;trange paper I &s;ent you and return it in your next. I &s;ent it in her own hand-writing, that your eyes might have full conviction. I took a copy of it, but I have &s;ince recollected I

may want the original. The time may come when &s;he may a&s;&s;ail me with accu|&s;ation and complaint: I will then pre|&s;ent that paper, and fla&s;h guilt upon her!</P>
<P>I am much deceived if I do not ob|&s;erve in this gardening and improving knight a want of former cordiality, a de|crea&s;e of ardour, and perhaps a wi&s;h to retract&mdash;Why let him!&mdash;To the daugh|ter's deadly &s;ins let him add new: it will but make invention more active, and re|venge more keen! I will have an eye upon him: I half hope my &s;u&s;picions are true!</P>
<P>The aunt Wenbourne too &s;till conti|nues to give laud unto Mr. Henley!&mdash;Damn Mr. Henley!&mdash;But &s;he may be nece&s;&s;ary; and, a &s;he is entirely go|verned
<PB N="11" REF="12">
by the gull Edward, I mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to bring my&s;elf into his favour. The thing may ea&s;ily be done.</P>
<P>The lordly uncle Fitz-Allen is &s;ecure. I frequently dine with him on what he calls his open day; he being over|whelmed with bu&s;ine&s;s, as blockheads u&s;ually are; and I do not fail to in&s;i|nuate the relation&s;hip in which, if care be not taken, he may hereafter chance to &s;tand to a gardener's &s;on. His face flames at the &s;uppo&s;ition, and his red no&s;e burns more bright! What will it do, &s;hould I make him my tool, when he finds to what good purpo&s;e he has been an abettor? Be that his con|cern; it neither is nor ever &s;hall be mine.</P>
<P>But none of the&s;e are the exact agent
<PB N="12" REF="13">
I want; nor have I found him yet. They at be&s;t can only act as auxiliaries. Laura indeed may be eminently u&s;eful; but the plotting, daring, mi&s;chievous, ma|lignant yet &s;ubaltern imp incarnate, that &s;hould run, fly, dive, be vi&s;ible and in|vi&s;ible, and plunge through fro&s;t or fire to execute my behe&s;ts, is yet to be di&s;|covered.</P>
<P>Were I in Italy, di&s;bur&s;e but a few &s;equins and battling legions would move at my bidding: but here we have nei|ther cici&s;beos, carnivals, confe&s;&s;ors, bra|voes nor &s;anctuaries. No&mdash;We have too few prie&s;ts and too much morality for our noble corps to flouri&s;h in full perfection.</P>
<P>I know not that all this may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, but I &s;u&s;pect it will, and I mu&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="14">
prepare for the wor&s;t; for I will accom|pli&s;h my purpo&s;e in de&s;pite of hell or ho|ne&s;ty!&mdash;Ay, Fairfax, will!&mdash;Gentle means, in&s;inuation, and hypocri&s;y &s;hall be my fir&s;t re&s;ource; and if the&s;e fail me, then I will order my engines to play!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>I have been once more reading my copy of this unaccountable paper, and though every word is engraven in my memory, it dropped from my hand with new a&s;toni&s;hment! Her hi&s;tory of her Mr. Henley, the yearnings of her heart toward him, and her unaba&s;hed ju&s;tifi|cation of all &s;he has &s;aid, all &s;he has thought and all &s;he has done are not to be paralleled in the records of female extravagance.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
She comes however to the point at la&s;t&mdash;Calculation is in favour of celi|bacy&mdash;For once, lady, you are in the right!&mdash;We may appear to agree on ca&s;es more dubious, but on that it will be miraculous if we ever hereafter dif|fer.</P>
<P>I cannot but again applaud my&s;elf, for keeping my preconcerted re&s;olution of &s;ilence and re&s;erve &s;o firmly. I rejoice in my fortitude and my fore&s;ight; for her efforts were &s;o &s;trenuous, and her emotions &s;o catching, that had I been le&s;s prepared all had been lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Dover Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YES, yes, Fairfax! She takes the &s;ure and re&s;olute road to ruin, and tra|vels it with unwearied ardour!&mdash;What think you &s;he has done now?&mdash;An earthquake would have been more within my calculation!&mdash;She labours hard after the marvellous!&mdash;She has been angling
<PB N="16" REF="17">
again in the muddy pool of paradox, and has hooked up a new dogma!&mdash;And what is it?&mdash;Why nothing le&s;s than an a&s;&s;everation that the promi&s;e &s;he made me is not binding!&mdash;Promi&s;es are non|entities: they mean nothing, &s;tand for nothing, and nothing can claim.</P>
<P>So be it&mdash;It is a maxim, divine apo&s;|tate, that will at lea&s;t &s;erve my turn as effectually as yours. To own the truth, I never thought promi&s;es made to capri|cious ladies &s;tood for much; nor were my &s;cruples at pre&s;ent likely to have been increa&s;ed. If &s;he, a woman, be &s;imple enough to have faith in the word of man, 'tis her fault. Let her look to it!</P>
<P>This is not all: the doctrine is not of her own invention! Mr. Henley, the
<PB N="17" REF="18">
eternal Mr. Henley again appears upon the &s;cene, from which he is &s;carcely ever a moment ab&s;ent!&mdash;Were it po&s;&s;ible I could relent, &s;he is determined I &s;hall not. But they are both down in my ta|blets, in large and indelible characters; on the black li&s;t; and there for a time at lea&s;t they &s;hall remain.</P>
<P>My plan, Fairfax, is formed; and I believe completely. When I was fir&s;t acquainted with her, as you know, my meaning was hone&s;t and my heart &s;in|cere. I was a fool at lea&s;t for a fort|night; for that was the &s;horte&s;t period before I began at all to waver. I was indeed deeply &s;mitten! Nor is de&s;ire cooled: delay, oppo&s;ition, and neglect have only changed its purpo&s;e. She &s;oon indeed taught me to treat her in
<PB N="18" REF="19">
&s;ome manner like the re&s;t of her &s;ex, and to begin to plot. 'Tis well for me that I have a fertile brain: and it had been well for her could &s;he have been contented with the conque&s;t &s;he had made, and have treated me with gene|ro&s;ity equal to my de&s;erts. But a hypo|crite &s;he has made me, and a hypocrite &s;he &s;hall find me; ay and a deep one.</P>
<P>She has her&s;elf given me my clue: &s;he has laid open her whole heart. She has the fatuity to mimic the perfect he|roine! Tell her but it is a duty, and with the Bramin wives &s;he would lie down, calmly and re&s;olutely, on the burning pile!</P>
<P>Well then! I will tell her of a duty of which &s;he little dreams! Yes, &s;he &s;hall grant every thing I wi&s;h as an act of
<PB N="19" REF="20">
duty! I will convince her it is one! I! The pretty immaculate lamb mu&s;t &s;ub|mit in this point to become my pupil; and it &s;hall go hard or I will prove as &s;ubtle a logician as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you, Fairfax? Is not the project an excellent one? Is it not worthy of the &s;apient Doctor Clifton? Shall I lo&s;e reputation, think you, by carrying it into effect?</P>
<P>I am already become a new man. My whole &s;y&s;tem is changed. She begins to prai&s;e me mo&s;t unmercifully; and, while my very heart is tickled with my &s;ucce&s;s, the lengthened vi&s;age of in|&s;pired quaker when the &s;pirit moved was never more demure! I am too plea&s;ed, too proud of my own talents, not to per&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">
Already I am a convert to one of <HI>her truths.</HI> Do laugh, Fairfax! I have ac|knowledged that you and your footman are equal! Is it not ridiculous? Howe|ver I am convinced! Ay and convinced I will remain, till time &s;hall be. She &s;hall teach me a truth a day!&mdash;Yet, no&mdash;I mu&s;t not learn too fa&s;t; it may be &s;u&s;pi|cious: though I would be as &s;peedy as I conveniently can in my progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The zeal of di&s;putation burns within her; and, as I tell you, I am already one of her very good boys, becau&s;e the pur&s;uit of my own project makes me now as willing to li&s;ten and hunt after deductions, &s;uch as I want, as &s;he is to teach and to &s;upply me with tho&s;e de|ductions. She &s;tarts at no propo&s;ition, however extravagant, if it do but ap|pear
<PB N="21" REF="22">
to re&s;ult from any one of her fa|vourite &s;y&s;tems, of which &s;he has a good round number. Rather than relinqui&s;h the lea&s;t of them, &s;he would &s;uppo&s;e the glorious &s;un a coal-pit; and his dazzling rays no better than volumes of black &s;moke, poli&s;hed and grown bright on their travels by attrition. She profe&s;&s;es it to be the purpo&s;e of her life to free her&s;elf from all prejudices. But here &s;he has the mode&s;ty to add the &s;aving clau&s;e&mdash;"If it be practicable."</P>
<P>Could &s;he, Fairfax, have a more con|venient hypothe&s;is? Do you not per|ceive its fecundity? And, the ta&s;k being &s;o very difficult, will it not be benevo|lent in me to lend her my a&s;&s;i&s;tance? What think you? Is it not po&s;&s;ible to prove that marriage is a mere prejudice?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">
She &s;hall find me willing to learn many or perhaps all of her doctrines; and in return I de&s;ire to teach her no more than one of mine. Can any thing be more rea&s;onable, more generous? Nay, I will go further! I will not teach it her; &s;he &s;hall have all the honour of teaching it to me! Can man do more?</P>
<P>The mo&s;t knotty and perplexed part of my plan was to find a contrivance to make the gardener's &s;on an actor in the plot. The thing is difficult, but not impo&s;&s;ible. I have various &s;tratagems and &s;chemes, in the choice of which I mu&s;t be guided by circum&s;tances. That which plea&s;es me mo&s;t is to invite him to &s;it in &s;tate, the umpire of our di&s;qui|&s;itions.</P>
<P>I think I can depend upon my&s;elf,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
otherwi&s;e there would be danger in the project. But if I act my part perfectly, if I have but the re&s;olution to li&s;ten coolly to their quiddities, &s;ometimes to oppo&s;e, &s;ometimes to recede, and al|ways to own my&s;elf conquered on the points which &s;uit me be&s;t, I believe both the gentleman and the lady will be &s;uffi|ciently &s;imple to &s;uppo&s;e that in all this there will be nothing apocryphal. They will imagine the gilt &s;tatue to be pure gold. I &s;hall be numbered among their elect! I &s;hall ri&s;e from the alembic a &s;aint of their own &s;ubliming! Shall be a&s;&s;ayed and &s;tamped current at their mint!</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t be cautious. I would put my hand in the fire ere undertake &s;o ap|parently mad a &s;cheme, with any other
<PB N="24" REF="25">
couple in Chri&s;tendom. Con&s;idering how very warm&mdash;Cur&s;es bite and tingle on my tongue at the recollection!&mdash;Con&s;idering I &s;ay how very warm I know their inclinations toward each other to be, nothing but the proofs I have had could prompt me to com|mence an enterprize &s;o improbable. But the uncommonne&s;s of it is a main part of its merit; and I think I know the ground I have to travel &s;o well that I do not much fear I &s;hould lo&s;e my road.</P>
<P>I am aware that the enemy I have mo&s;t to guard again&s;t is my&s;elf. To pretend a belief in opinions I de&s;pi&s;e, to &s;it with &s;aturnine gravity and nod appro|bation when my &s;ides are convul&s;ed with laughter, to ape admiration at what
<PB N="25" REF="26">
rea&s;on contemns and &s;purns, and to &s;mooth my features into &s;uavity while my heart is bur&s;ting with gall at the in|tercour&s;e they continually hold, of becks and &s;miles and approving kind epithets, to do all this is almo&s;t too much for mortal man! But I have already made &s;everal e&s;&s;ays on my&s;elf, and I find that the ob&s;tinate re&s;olution which an in&s;atia|ble thir&s;t of ample retribution in&s;pires is not to be &s;haken, and renders me equal even to this ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I am well aware however what dan|gerous quick&s;ands the pa&s;&s;ions are; and that a good pilot is never &s;paring of &s;oundings. I will therefore not only keep a rigorous watch upon my&s;elf, but take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hall enable me to exclude or retain the grub-monger, as I
<PB N="26" REF="27">
&s;hall think fit, during our conver&s;a|tions.</P>
<P>Thus you are likely &s;oon to hear more of our metaphy&s;ics; nay, if you be but indu&s;trious, enough to enable you to &s;et up for your&s;elf, and become the apo&s;tle of Paris. I know no place where, if you have but a mor&s;el of the marvellous to detail, you will find hearers better di&s;|po&s;ed to gape and &s;wallow.</P>

<P>AFORTNIGHT has almo&s;t elap&s;ed &s;ince I la&s;t wrote to my Loui&s;a, till my heart begins to cry &s;hame at the delay. Could I plead no other excu&s;e than the trifling occupations of a trifling world I mu&s;t &s;ign my own condemnation; but

<P>Nor is it le&s;s delightful to ob&s;erve the &s;atisfaction which this reform &s;ometimes gives to Frank Henley. At others in|deed he owns he is di&s;turbed by doubt: but he owns it with feelings of regret, and is eager to prove him&s;elf unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet re&s;pecting me his thoughts never vary&mdash;Alas! Loui&s;a, I &s;till "am his by right." His tongue is &s;ilent, but his looks and manner are &s;ufficiently audi|ble. I &s;urely have been guilty of the error I &s;o much dreaded; my cau&s;e was &s;trong, but my arguments were feeble; I have prolonged the warfare of the pa&s;|&s;ions which I attempted to eradicate; or rather have left on his mind a deep &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice committed by me&mdash;! The
<PB N="31" REF="32">

<P>But oh with what equanimity, with what fortitude does he endure his ima|gined wrongs! Pure mo&s;t pure mu&s;t that pa&s;&s;ion be which at once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;trength of his and his forbearance! There are indeed but few Frank Henleys!</P>
<P>Surely, Loui&s;a, I may do him ju&s;|tice?&mdash;Surely to e&s;teem the virtuous can|not merit the imputation of guilt?&mdash;Who can prai&s;e him as he de&s;erves? And can that which is right in others be wrong in me?&mdash;Yet &s;uch are the mi&s;|takes to which we are &s;ubject, I &s;carcely can &s;peak or even think of him without &s;u&s;pecting my&s;elf of committing &s;ome culpable impropriety!</P>
<P>Pardon, Loui&s;a, the&s;e wanderings of

<P>My feelings have led me from the topic I intended for the chief &s;ubject of this letter.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of our enquiries has &s;eve|ral times forced us upon that great que&s;|tion, <Q>the progre&s;s of mind toward perfection, and the different order of things which mu&s;t inevitably be the re&s;ult.</Q> Ye&s;terday this theme again occurred. Frank was pre&s;ent; and his imagination, warm with the &s;ublimity of his &s;ubject, drew a bold and &s;plendid pic|ture of the felicity of that &s;tate of &s;ociety when per&s;onal property no longer &s;hall
<PB N="33" REF="34">
exi&s;t, when the whole torrent of mind &s;hall unite in enquiry after the beautiful and the true, when it &s;hall no longer be diverted by tho&s;e in&s;ignificant pur&s;uits to which the ab&s;urd follies that originate in our fal&s;e wants give birth, when indi|vidual &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;hall be unknown, and when all &s;hall labour for the good of all!</P>
<P>A &s;tate &s;o di&s;tant from pre&s;ent man|ners and opinions, and apparently &s;o im|po&s;&s;ible, naturally gave ri&s;e to objec|tions; and your brother put many &s;hrewd and pertinent que&s;tions, which would have &s;ilenced a mind le&s;s inform|ed and le&s;s comprehen&s;ive than that of our in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>At la&s;t a difficulty aro&s;e which to me wore a very &s;erious form; and as what was &s;aid left a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on my me|mory, I will relate that part of the con|ver&s;ation.
<PB N="34" REF="35">
Ob&s;erve, Loui&s;a, that Clif|ton and Frank were the chief &s;peakers. Your brother began.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, &s;ir, you have removed ma|ny apparently unconquerable difficulties: but I have a further objection which I think unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>What is it?</P>
<P>Neither man nor woman in &s;uch a &s;tate can have any thing peculiar: the whole mu&s;t be for the u&s;e and benefit of the whole?</P>
<P>As generally as practice will admit: and how very general that may be, im|perfect as its con&s;titution was, Sparta re|mained during five hundred years a proof.</P>
<P>Then how will it be po&s;&s;ible, when &s;ociety &s;hall be the general po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, for any man to &s;ay<HI>&mdash;This is my &s;ervant?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
He cannot: there will be no &s;er|vants.</P>
<P>Well but<HI>&mdash;This is my child?</HI></P>
<P>Neither can he do that: they will be the children of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Indeed!&mdash;And what &s;ay you to<HI>&mdash;This is my wife?&mdash;</HI>Can appropriation more than for the minute the hour or the day exi&s;t? Or, among &s;o di&s;inte|re&s;ted a people, can a man &s;ay even of the woman he loves<HI>&mdash;She is mine?</HI></P>
<P>[We pau&s;ed&mdash;I own, Loui&s;a, I found my&s;elf at a lo&s;s; but Frank &s;oon gave a very &s;atisfactory reply.]</P>
<P>You have &s;tarted a que&s;tion of infi|nite importance, which perhaps I am not fully prepared to an&s;wer. I doubt whether in that better &s;tate of human &s;o|ciety, to which I look forward with &s;uch
<PB N="36" REF="37">
ardent a&s;piration, the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes will be altogether promi&s;cuous and unre&s;trained; or whether they will ad|mit of &s;omething that may be denomi|nated marriage. The former may per|haps be the truth: but it is at lea&s;t cer|tain that in the &s;en&s;e in which we under|&s;tand marriage and the affirmation<HI>&mdash;This is my wife&mdash;</HI>neither the in&s;titution nor the claim can in &s;uch a &s;tate, or in|deed in ju&s;tice exi&s;t. Of all the regu|lations which were ever &s;ugge&s;ted to the mi&s;taken tyranny of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, none perhaps to this day have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the de&s;poti&s;m of tho&s;e which undertake to bind not only body to body but &s;oul to &s;oul, to all futurity, in de&s;pite of every po&s;&s;ible change which our vices and our virtues might effect, or however nume|rous
<PB N="37" REF="38">
the &s;ecret corporal or mental imper|fections might prove which a more in|timate acquaintance &s;hould bring to light!</P>
<P>Then you think that &s;ome &s;tipulation or bargain between the &s;exes mu&s;t take place, in the mo&s;t virtuous ages?</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t virtuous ages the word bargain, like the word promi&s;e, will be unintelligible&mdash;We cannot bargain to do what is wrong, nor can we, though there &s;hould be no bargain, forbear to do what is right, without being unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Whence it re&s;ults that marriage, as a civil in&s;titution, mu&s;t ever be an evil?</P>
<P>Yes. It ought not to be a civil in&s;ti|tution. It is the concern of the indivi|duals who con&s;ent to this mutual a&s;&s;ocia|tion, and they ought not to be prevent|ed
<PB N="38" REF="39">
from beginning, &s;u&s;pending, or ter|minating it as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Clifton addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me&mdash;What &s;ay you to this doctrine, madam? Does it not &s;hock, does it not terrify you?</P>
<P>As far as I have con&s;idered it, no. It appears to be founded on incontrover|tible principles; and I ought not to be &s;hocked that &s;ome of my prejudices are oppo&s;ed, or at being reminded that men have not yet attained the true means of correcting their own vices.</P>
<P>Surely the con&s;equences are alarm|ing! The man who only &s;tudied the gratification of his de&s;ires would have a new wife each new day; and the unpro|tected fair would be abandoned to all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of libertini&s;m!</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">
Frank again replied&mdash;Then you think the &s;ecurity of women would increa&s;e with their imagined increa&s;e of danger; and that an unprincipled man, who even at pre&s;ent if he be known is avoided and de&s;pi&s;ed, would then find a more ready welcome, becau&s;e as you &s;uppo&s;e he would have more opportunities to in|jure?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own that the men fit to be tru&s;ted with &s;o much power are in my opinion very few indeed.</P>
<P>You are imagining a &s;ociety as per|ver&s;e and vitiated as the pre&s;ent: I am &s;uppo&s;ing one wholly the contrary. I know too well that there are men who, becau&s;e unju&s;t laws and cu&s;toms worthy of barbarians have condemned helple&s;s women to infamy, for the lo&s;s of
<PB N="40" REF="41">
that which under better regulations and in ages of more wi&s;dom has been and will again be guilt to keep, I know, &s;ir, I &s;ay that the pre&s;ent world is infe&s;ted by men, who make it the bu&s;ine&s;s and the glory of their lives to bring this infamy upon the very beings for whom they feign the deepe&s;t affection!&mdash;If ever pa|tience can for&s;ake me it will be at the re|collection of the&s;e demons in the human form, who come tricked out in all the &s;miles of love, the prote&s;tations of loy|alty, and the arts of hell, unrelentingly and cau&s;ele&s;sly to prey upon confiding innocence! Nothing but the malver&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of man could give being or countenance to &s;uch a mon&s;ter! What|ever is good, exqui&s;ite, or precious, we are individually taught to gra&s;p at, and

if po&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure; but we have each a latent &s;en&s;e that this principle has ren|dered us a &s;ociety of dete&s;table mi&s;ers, and therefore to rob each other &s;eems al|mo&s;t like the &s;ports of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on, &s;ir, were I a father, I think I &s;hould &s;hudder to hear you in|&s;tructing my daughters in your doc|trines.</P>
<P>I perceive you wholly mi&s;conceive me; and I very &s;eriou&s;ly reque&s;t, pray ob&s;erve, &s;ir, I very &s;eriou&s;ly reque&s;t you to remember that I would not teach any man's daughters &s;o mad a doctrine as to indulge in &s;en&s;ual appetites, or fo&s;ter a licentious imagination. I am not the apo&s;tle of depravity. While men &s;hall be mad, fooli&s;h, and di&s;hone&s;t enough to be vain of bad principles, women may

<P>I am glad to be undeceived.

<P>Tell me, my dear Loui&s;a, are you not delighted with this dialogue; and with the candour, the force of thinking, and what is &s;till better the virtuous fears of your brother? His mind revolted at the mi&s;chief which it &s;eemed to forebode: he was happy at being undeceived. And, with re&s;pect to argument, I doubt whether he forgot any one of the mo&s;t apparently formidable objections to what is called the levelling &s;y&s;tem.

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> I thought I had forgotten &s;omething. When Frank had retired, your brother with delightful candour prai&s;ed the great per&s;picuity as well as &s;trength with which he argued. He added there was one circum&s;tance in particular in his principles concerning marriage, although they had at fir&s;t ap|peared
<PB N="45" REF="46">
very alarming, which was highly &s;atisfactory: and this was the confidence they in&s;pired. <Q>Nothing, he &s;aid, gave his nature &s;o much offence as the &s;u&s;|picions with which, at pre&s;ent, our &s;ex view the men. About two years ago he had a partiality for a Neapo|litan lady, and thought him&s;elf in love with her: but in this he was mi&s;|taken; it was rather inclination than pa&s;&s;ion. He knew not at that time what it was to love. Neither this Neapolitan lady, though beautiful and highly accompli&s;hed, nor any other woman his feelings told him could in|&s;pire pure affection, who was incapa|ble of confiding in her&s;elf; and, wanting this &s;elf-confidence, of con|fiding in her lover.

in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf defect, Tho&s;e who cannot tru&s;t them&s;elves cannot be induced to tru&s;t others.</Q></P>
<P>Thus ju&s;tly, Loui&s;a, did he continue to rea&s;on. Nor could I forbear to ap|ply the doctrine to my&s;elf: I have been too di&s;tru&s;tful of him; my con&s;cience accu&s;ed me, and I am re&s;olved to re|medy the fault. I have always held &s;u&s;picion to be the vice of mean and fee|ble minds: but it is le&s;s difficult to find rules by theory than to demon&s;trate them by practice.</P>

<P>I WILL not &s;uppo&s;e, Fairfax, you &s;eek to compliment me, when you &s;ay you enjoy the exuberant heat of &s;oul, the fire that pervades my epi&s;tles. I am glad you do. I &s;hall not think the wor&s;e of your talents. Many a line have I written in all the bur&s;t of feeling, and
<PB N="48" REF="49">
not a few in all the blaze of wit, and have &s;aid to my&s;elf,&mdash;Should he not un|der&s;tand me now?&mdash;Why if he &s;hould not, dulne&s;s everla&s;ting be his por|tion!&mdash;But you take the &s;ure way to keep up my ardour. While I perceive you continue to enjoy I &s;hall continue to be communicative. A &s;ympathetic yawner I may be, but I do not believe I am often the fir&s;t to begin.</P>
<P>I knew not half my own merits. I act my part to admiration. 'Tis true the combining circum&s;tances are all favour|able. I mu&s;t be a dunce indeed if i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch a &s;chool I &s;hould want chi|canery.

the la&s;t; managed as it was with dexte|rity by me, and in the very &s;pirit I wi&s;hed by my opponents. I &s;peak in the plural; for I took care to have them both pre&s;ent. Several remarks which I had heard from him a&s;&s;ured me he would &s;econd my plan; which was no le&s;s than to prove&mdash;marriage a farce!&mdash;Would you have believed, Fairfax, I &s;hould have had the temerity to &s;tep upon a rock &s;o &s;lippery; and to have reque&s;ted this Archimago of Adam's journeymen [Adam you know being the world's head-gardener] to &s;tay and lend me his &s;upport?&mdash;Yet thus audacious was I; and courage as it ought has been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s!</P>
<P>The thought was &s;ugge&s;ted by them|&s;elves; and, had you or I or any of us
<PB N="50" REF="51">
vile marriage haters been declaiming again&s;t the &s;affron god, and his eternal &s;hackles, I doubt whether the be&s;t of us could have &s;aid any thing half &s;o much to the purpo&s;e!&mdash;Is it not excellent?&mdash;</P>
<P>Then had you heard me preach, ay, me my&s;elf, again&s;t libertines and liber|tini&s;m!</P>
<P>By the by, Don Cabbage-plant had the in&s;olence to &s;ay two or three devili&s;h &s;evere things, di&s;honourable to the noble fraternity of us knights of the bed-chamber, which if I forget may woman never more have cau&s;e to remember me!</P>
<P>However I brought him to own,&mdash;I&mdash;[Do laugh!] by my very great ap|prehen&s;ions of the effects of &s;uch a doc|trine, that though marriage be a bad
<PB N="51" REF="52">
thing it is quite nece&s;&s;ary, at pre&s;ent, for the defence of the weaker ve&s;&s;els and mode&s;t maidenhood. Ay and I ap|plauded him for his hone&s;t candour! I was glad I had mi&s;under&s;tood him! Thanked him for all his profound in|formation! In &s;hort made him exactly what I wi&s;hed, my tool! And a high|tempered tool he is, by the aid of which I will &s;hew my&s;elf a mo&s;t notable work|man!&mdash;</P>
<P>Not but the fellow's eye was upon me. I could ob&s;erve him prying, endeavour|ing to &s;earch and probe me. But I came too well prepared. In&s;tead of &s;hrinking from the encounter, my brow contracted increa&s;ing indignation; and my voice grew louder, as I &s;tood forth the champion of cha&s;te virginity and
<PB N="52" REF="53">
fanctimonious wedlock!&mdash;The &s;cene, in the very critical &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, was high comedy!&mdash;</P>
<P>It was well, Fairfax, they went no farther than Paris: had either of them only reached Turin I had been half un|done! And had they touched at Na|ples, Rome, Venice, or half a dozen other fair and flouri&s;hing cities, my cha|racter for a pretty behaved, demure, and virtuous gentleman had been irremedia|bly ruined!</P>
<P>Upon my &s;oul I cannot put it out of my head!&mdash;Had you heard me remon|&s;trate what a horrid thing it would be to have marriage de&s;troyed, and us hone&s;t fellows turned loo&s;e among the virgins, from whom we &s;hould catch and ravi&s;h each a new dam&s;el every new day, and
<PB N="53" REF="54">
had you &s;een what a fine &s;erious under|taker's face I put upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, your heart would have chuckled! To the day of your death it would never have been forgotten!</P>
<P>Perhaps you will wonder how I could draw &s;uch a doctrine from the&s;e &s;pinners of hypothe&s;is. I will tell you. I had heard them &s;everally maintain&mdash;Try to gue&s;s what!&mdash;Not in &s;even years, though you were to do nothing el&s;e.&mdash;You I &s;uppo&s;e like me have heard that liberty, &s;ecurity, and property are the three main pillars of political happine&s;s?&mdash;Well then, the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors maintain that indi|vidual property is a general evil!&mdash;What is more, they maintain it by &s;uch arguments as would puzzle college, council, or &s;enate to refute. But that I

am determined never to torment my brain about &s;uch quips and quillets, may I turn Turk if they would not have made a convert of me, and have per|&s;uaded me that an e&s;tate of ten thou&s;and a year was a very intolerable thing!</P>
<P>My intention was to keep my coun|tenance, but to laugh at them in my heart mo&s;t incontinently. However, I &s;oon found my &s;ide of the que&s;tion was not &s;o perfectly beyond all doubt, nor theirs quite &s;o ridiculous as I had ima|gined.</P>
<P>'Tis true, I went predetermined to be convinced, and to take all they &s;hould tell me for go&s;pel. I had a conclu&s;ion of my own to draw, and if I could but lead to that, I cared not how much I granted.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">
I know not whether this predi&s;po&s;ition in me was of any advantage to their ar|gument, though I think it was not; for, &s;o ready was the &s;olution to every difficulty, I boldly ventured to &s;tate ob|jections which I meant to have kept out of &s;ight, le&s;t I &s;hould my&s;elf overturn a &s;y&s;tem that &s;uited my purpo&s;e. I per|ceived their eagerne&s;s, &s;aw there was no danger that they &s;hould &s;top at trifles even if I &s;hould happen to throw them a bone to pick, and the readine&s;s of each reply rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity. I fearle&s;sly drew out my heavy artillery, which they with ea&s;e and &s;afety as fearle&s;sly di&s;|mounted. With a breath my &s;trong holds were all puffed down, like &s;o many hou&s;es of cards.</P>
<P>By this however my main bu&s;ine&s;s

was done more effectually. We came to it by fair deduction. It was not ab|ruptly introduced; it was major, minor, and con&s;equent&mdash;All individual property is an evil&mdash;Marriage makes woman indi|vidual property&mdash;Therefore marriage is an evil&mdash;Could there be better logic?</P>
<P>As for his &s;aving clau&s;e, that marriage in the&s;e times of prejudice and vice [I have the whole cant by rote, Fairfax.] is a nece&s;&s;ary evil, leave me to do that away. What! Is &s;he not a heroine? And can I not convince her that to act according to a bad &s;y&s;tem, when there is a better, were to de&s;cend to the ways of the vulgar? Can I not teach her how &s;uperior &s;he is to the pretty mi&s;&s;es who conform to &s;uch mi&s;taken laws? Shall &s;he want the courage and the genero&s;ity
<PB N="57" REF="58">
to &s;et the fir&s;t good example? How often have I &s;een her eyes &s;parkle, her bo&s;om heave, and her zeal break forth in virtuous re&s;olutions to encounter any peril to obtain a worthy purpo&s;e! And can there be a more worthy?</P>
<P>Cur&s;e upon the&s;e qualms of con&s;ci|ence! Never before did I feel any thing &s;o teazing, &s;o tormenting! And, knowing what I know, remembering what I never can forget, the &s;lights, in|juries, and in&s;ults I have received, how I came to feel them now is to me wholly in|conceivable. She is acting it is true with what &s;he calls the be&s;t and pure&s;t of in|tentions toward me; &s;he believes them to be &s;uch; &s;he &s;ometimes almo&s;t obliges me to believe them &s;uch my&s;elf.

<P>Be&s;ide I could not but remember our old maxims, the Cyprian battles our jo|vial corps had fought, and the myrtle wreaths each wight had won. Should I, the leader the captain of the band, be the fir&s;t to fly my colours? Was it not our favourite axiom that he who could declare, upon his honour, he had found a generous woman, who never had at|tempted once to deceive, trifle with, or play him trick, &s;hould &s;till be acknow|ledged a companion of our order, even though he were to marry: but that all coquetry, all tergiver&s;ation, all wrongs, however &s;light, were unpar|donable,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
and only one way to be re|dre&s;&s;ed? What an&s;wer can con&s;cience give to that?</P>
<P>Your letters too are another &s;timula|lative. You detail the full, true and par|ticular account of your amorous male|factions, and vaunt of petty ob&s;tacles, petty arts, and petty triumphs over Sig|noras and Madames who advance, chal|lenge you to the field, and give battle purpo&s;ely to be overcome. Their whole re&s;i&s;tance is but to make you feel how great an Alexander you are, and that having vanqui&s;hed them you are invin|cible! As you will certainly never meet with an Anna St. Ives, 'tis po&s;&s;ible you may die in that opinion. But, I tell you, Fairfax, if you compare the&s;e prac|ti&s;ed Amazons to my heroine, you are
<PB N="62" REF="63">
in a mo&s;t heterodox and damnable error, of which if you do not timely repent your &s;oul will never find admi&s;&s;ion into the lover's Ely&s;ium.</P>
<P>Bear witne&s;s, however, to my hone&s;ty; of women I allow her to be the mo&s;t ex|cellent, but &s;till a woman, and not as I fooli&s;hly for a while &s;uppo&s;ed an ab&s;olute godde&s;s. No, no. Madam can curvet and play her pranks, though of totally a dif|ferent kind; and, being almo&s;t mortal at pre&s;ent, mere mortal mu&s;t become in de|&s;pite of con&s;cience and its green &s;ickne&s;s phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I knew her not; and, unwil|ling to encounter logic in a gauze cap, I cea&s;ed to oppo&s;e her arguments, and thought to conciliate her by re&s;olving to be of her creed. What could be more
<PB N="63" REF="64">
generous? But no, for&s;ooth! The veil was too thin! To pretend conviction when it was not felt, and to be &s;atisfied with arguments before I had heard them, were all in&s;ufficient for her! The prize could be gained only by him who could an&s;wer the enigmas of the Sphinx! I mu&s;t enter the li&s;ts of cavil, and run a tilt at wrangling, ere the lady would be&s;tow the meed of conque&s;t! Can con&s;cience pretend to palliate conduct like this?</P>
<P>I then turned my thoughts to a new project, and endeavoured to overpower her by pa&s;&s;ion, by exce&s;s of ardour, by tenderne&s;s and importunity. They had a temporary effect, but I found them equally inefficacious. Nor was the art by which I had oftene&s;t been &s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="64" REF="65">
forgotten; though I confe&s;s that with her, from the beginning, it afforded me but little hope. I tried to familiarize her to freedoms. I began with her hands; but &s;he &s;oon taught me that even her hands were &s;acred; they were not to be treated with familiarity, nor to be ki&s;&s;ed and pre&s;&s;ed like other hands! Let con&s;cience if it can tell me why.</P>
<P>In fine, while to this in&s;olent peda|gogue &s;he has been all honey&s;uckle, &s;weet marjoram and heart's ea&s;e, to me &s;he has been rue, wormwood and helle|bore: him prai&s;ing, me reproving: confiding in him, &s;u&s;pecting me: and, as the very &s;ummit and crown of in|jury, proclaiming him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or the ma&s;ter of her admiration, or in plain Engli&s;h of her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66">
And now, if after this impartial, this cool, this &s;toic examination Mr. Con|&s;cience &s;hould ever again be impertinent enough to open his lips, I am deter|mined without the lea&s;t ceremony to kick him out of doors.</P>
<P>When this famous conference of which I told you &s;ome half an hour ago was ended, and our pre&s;ident, our monarch of morals and mulberries had quitted his chair and withdrawn, I played an aftergame of no &s;mall moment. After pronouncing a panegyric on the gentle|man, as a legi&s;lator fit for truth and me, I read the lady a mode&s;t lecture on con|fidence, informed her of almo&s;t the exact quantity which I expected &s;he would re|po&s;e in me, and declaimed with elo|quence and effect again&s;t tho&s;e &s;u&s;picious

beauties who always regard us hone&s;t fellows as &s;o many naughty goblins; who, like the Ethiopian mon&s;ter, vora|ciou&s;ly devour every Virgin-Andromeda they meet.

<P>Poor girl! Is it not a pity that the very &s;hield in which &s;he confides, her perfect hone&s;ty and &s;incerity, &s;hould be de&s;tined to fall upon and overwhelm her?&mdash;Thus &s;ays coun&s;ellor Sentiment: and coun&s;ellor Sentiment is a great ora|tor!&mdash;But what &s;ay I?

The&s;e however are but the prelimi|naries, the preparations for the combat. Ere long I &s;hall be armed at all points, and what is better by her own fair hands.

I have been ca&s;ting about to &s;end this &s;uperintendant of the cardi|nal virtues, this captain of ca&s;ui&s;ts and caterpillars out of the way; and I think I have hit upon a tolerably bold and in|genious &s;tratagem. I &s;ay bold becau&s;e I perceive it is not without danger; but I doubt I cannot devi&s;e a better. With|out naming or appearing to mean my|&s;elf, I have fugge&s;ted to him, by in|venting a tale of two friends of mine, what a noble and di&s;intere&s;ted thing it would be for him to go down into the country and prevail on his father
<PB N="68" REF="69">
to remove all ob&s;tacles to our mar|riage&mdash;</P>
<P>How! Say you. Is marriage your plan? And if not is not that the way to ruin all?</P>
<P>There is the danger I talked of; but I do not think it great.

The cunning ra&s;cal has &s;o long been the keeper of Sir Arthur's pur&s;e, that it is &s;uppo&s;ed two thirds of the contents have glided into his own pocket. This is the rea&s;on of the delay on Sir Arthur's part, which at pre&s;ent I do not wi&s;h to &s;horten. That this &s;on of a grub catcher, a De|mo&s;thenes

though he be, &s;hould prevailon &s;uch a father, if he were to go down as I hope he will, is but little probable. However, &s;hould the lea&s;t progno&s;tic of &s;uch a miracle appear, I have my re|medy prepared. I will generou&s;ly have a letter written to the &s;enior over&s;eer of the gravel walks, which if the character I have heard of him be not wholly fal&s;e, &s;hall revive all his hopes, and put an end to compliance.</P>
<P>In Italy, where amorous plotting is the national profe&s;&s;ion, I was not ea&s;ily circumvented; and here, where another gunpowder trea&s;on would as &s;oon be &s;u&s;|pected as &s;uch gins and &s;nares, at lea&s;t by the&s;e very hone&s;t and &s;ublime &s;im|pletons, I laugh at the &s;uppo&s;ition of being unearthed.</P>

One word more.

<HEAD>FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY mind, Oliver, is hara&s;&s;ed by a variety of doubts. I believe I &s;hall &s;oon be down at Wenbourne Hill, and of cour&s;e &s;hall then not fail to meet thee and vi&s;it thy mo&s;t worthy father.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of my journey originates in the doubts I mentioned. I am angry
<PB N="73" REF="74">
with my&s;elf for feeling alarms at one moment which appear impo&s;&s;ibilities the next. If my fears have any foundation, this Clifton is the deepe&s;t, the mo&s;t hardened fiend-like hypocrite imagina|tion can paint!&mdash;But it cannot be!&mdash;Surely it cannot!&mdash;I am guilty, hei|nou&s;ly guilty for enduring &s;uch a thought!&mdash;So much folly and vice, combined with under&s;tanding and I may &s;ay genius &s;o uncommon, is a &s;uppo&s;i|tion too extravagant, too injurious!</P>
<P>And yet it is &s;trange, Oliver!&mdash;A conduct &s;o &s;uddenly altered, &s;o totally oppo&s;ite to old and inveterate habits, is &s;carcely reconcileable to the human cha|racter. But if di&s;&s;imulation can be pro|ductive of this, is truth le&s;s powerful? No!&mdash;Truth is omnipotent. Yet who
<PB N="74" REF="75">
ever &s;aw it ha&s;ty in its progre&s;s? My only hope in this ca&s;e is that the fuperi|ority of his mind has rendered him an exception to general rules.</P>
<P>But what could he propo&s;e by his hy|pocri&s;y?&mdash;I cannot tell&mdash;His pa&s;&s;ions are violent and ungovernable; and are or very lately have been in full vigour&mdash;Again and again 'tis &s;trange!</P>
<P>But what of this?&mdash;Why the&s;e fears? Can &s;he be &s;potted, tinged by the &s;tain of un&s;anctified de&s;ire?&mdash;Never!&mdash;The pure cha&s;tity of her &s;oul is &s;uperior to attaint!&mdash;Yet&mdash;Who can &s;ay?&mdash;Wil|fully her mind can never err: but who can affirm that even &s;he may not be de|ceived, and may not act erroneou&s;ly from the mo&s;t holy motives?</P>
<P>Perhaps, Oliver, it is my own &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="75" REF="76">
my own de&s;ires, but half &s;ubdued, in which the&s;e doubts take birth. If &s;o they are highly culpable.</P>
<P>Be it as it may, there is a duty vi&s;ibly chalked out for me by circum&s;tances. Her pre&s;ent &s;ituation is &s;urely a &s;tate of danger. To &s;ee them married would now give me delight. It would indeed be the delight of de&s;pair, of gloom al|mo&s;t approaching horror. But of that I mu&s;t not think. My father is the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent delay. I fear I cannot remove this impediment, but it becomes me to try.</P>
<P>Though I had before conceived the de&s;ign, this conduct has even been &s;ug|ge&s;ted to me by Clifton; and in a mode that proves he can be artful if he plea&s;e.
<PB N="76" REF="77">
Yet does it not likewi&s;e prove him to be in earne&s;t?</P>
<P>We have lately had &s;everal conver&s;a|tions, one in particular which, even while it &s;eemed to place him in an amia|ble, &s;incere, and generous light, excited &s;ome of the very doubts and terrors of which I &s;peak&mdash;If he be a hypocrite, he guards him&s;elf with a tenfold ma&s;k!&mdash;It cannot&mdash;No&mdash;It cannot be!&mdash;</P>
<P>I mean to &s;peak to Sir Arthur con|cerning my journey, but not to inform him of its purport: it would have the face of in&s;ult to tell him I was going to be his advocate with his &s;ervant. Not to mention that he has lately treated me with increa&s;ing and indeed unu&s;ual kindne&s;s. If I do make an effort, how|ever,
<PB N="77" REF="78">
it &s;hall be a &s;trenuous one; though my hopes that it &s;hould be effectual are very few. My deci&s;ion is not yet final, but in my next thou wilt probably learn the re&s;ult. Farewell.</P>

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> My brain is &s;o bu&s;ied by its fears that I forgot to caution thee again&s;t a mi&s;take into which it is probable this letter may lead. I mentioned, in one of my la&s;t, the project I had conceived of leaving England. Do not imagine I have abandoned a de&s;ign on which the more I reflect the more I am intent. The great end of life is to benefit com|munity. My mind in its pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion is too deeply affected freely and without incumbrance to exert it&s;elf&mdash;This
<PB N="78" REF="79">
is weakne&s;s!&mdash;But not the le&s;s true, Oliver. We are at pre&s;ent &s;o im|bued in prejudice, have drunken &s;o deeply of the cup of error, that, after having received taints &s;o numerous and ingrained, to wi&s;h for perfect con&s;i&s;tency in virtue I doubt were vain. Here or at the antipodes alike I &s;hould remember her: but I &s;hould not alike be &s;o often tempted and deluded by fal&s;e hopes: the current of thought would not &s;o of|ten meet with impediments, to arre&s;t, divide, and turn it a&s;ide.</P>
<P>I have &s;tudied to divine in what land or among what people, whether &s;avage or &s;uch as we call poli&s;hed, the energies of mind might be mo&s;t productive of good. But this is a di&s;covery which I have yet to make. The rea&s;ons are &s;o numerous
<PB N="79" REF="80">
on each &s;ide that I have formed a plan for a kind of double effort. I think of &s;ailing for America, where I may aid the &s;truggles of liberty, may freely publi&s;h all which the efforts of rea&s;on can teach me, and at the &s;ame time may form a &s;ociety of &s;avages, who &s;eem in con&s;e|quence of their very ignorance to have a le&s;s quantity of error, and therefore to be le&s;s liable to repel truth than tho&s;e who&s;e information is more multifarious. A merchant, with whom by accident I be|came acquainted, and who is a man of no mean under&s;tanding, approves and has engaged to promote my plan.

<P>COME to my aid, Fairfax; encou|rage me; feed my vanity; let hungry ambition banquet and allow me to be a hero, le&s;t I relent: for, were I not or Lucifer or Coke Clifton, 'tis certain I &s;hould not per&s;evere. By the ho&s;t of heaven, Fairfax, but &s;he is a divine

creature! She &s;teals upon the &s;oul! A heart of rock could not re&s;i&s;t her! Nor are they wiles, nor woman's lures, nor blandi&s;hments of trick&s;ey dimples, nor captivating &s;miles, with which &s;he forms her adamantine fetters. No; 'tis the open &s;oul of hone&s;ty; true, &s;incere, and unrelentingly ju&s;t, to me, to her&s;elf, to all; 'tis that enchanting kind|ne&s;s, that heavenly &s;uavity which ne|ver for&s;akes her; that equanimity of &s;miling yet ob&s;tinate fortitude; that hi|larity of heart that knows not gloom be|cau&s;e it knows not evil; that in&s;cruta|ble purity which re&s;ts &s;ecure that all like it&s;elf are natively immaculate; that&mdash;P&s;haw!&mdash;I can find no words, find you imagination therefore, and think not I will labour at impo&s;&s;ibility. You have

read of ancient ve&s;tals, of the virgins of Paradi&s;e, and of demi-deities that tune their golden harps on high?&mdash;Read again&mdash;And, having travelled with pro|phets and apo&s;tles to the heaven of hea|vens, de&s;cend and view her, and invent me language to de&s;cribe her, if you can!</P>
<P>Cur&s;e on this Frank Henley! But for him my vengeance never would have been rou&s;ed! Never would the fatal &s;entence have pa&s;&s;ed my lips!&mdash;'Tis now irrevocable&mdash;Sure as the lofty walls of Troy were doomed by gods and de&s;|tiny to &s;moke in ruins, &s;o &s;urely mu&s;t the high-&s;ouled Anna fall&mdash;"Ill &s;tarred wench!"&mdash;I, Fairfax, like other con|querors, cannot &s;hut pity from my bo|&s;om. While I cry havoc I could al|mo&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="84">
weep; could look reluctant down on deva&s;tation which my&s;elf had made, and heave a &s;igh, and cur&s;e my proper prowe&s;s!&mdash;In love and war alike, &s;uch, Fairfax, is towering ambition. It mu&s;t have victims: its reckle&s;s altars a&s;k a full and large &s;upply; and when per|chance a &s;nowy lamb, &s;potle&s;s and pure, bedecked for &s;acrifice, in all the artle&s;s pomp of un&s;u&s;pecting innocence is brought, bright burns the flame, the white clouds curl and mantle up to hea|ven, and there ambition proudly &s;its, and &s;nuffs with glut of lu&s;ty delight the grateful odour.</P>
<P>I know your tricks, Fairfax; you are one of the doubtful doctors; you love to catch credulity upon your hook. I hear fat laughter gurgling in your throat, and
<PB N="84" REF="85">
out bolts your threadbare &s;imile&mdash;"Be|fore the battle's won the Brentford hero &s;ings Te Deum."&mdash;But don't be wa&s;te|ful of the little wit you have. Do I not tell you it is decreed? When was I po&s;ted for a vapouring Hector? What but the recollections of my reiterated ravings, re&s;olves, threats, and impreca|tions could keep me &s;teady; a&s;&s;ailed as I am by gentlene&s;s, benevolence, and &s;aint-like charity?</P>
<P>By the agency of &s;ubtlety, hypocri&s;y, and fraud, I &s;eek to rob her of what the world holds mo&s;t precious. By can|dour, philanthropy, and a noble expan|&s;ion of heart, &s;he &s;eeks to render me all that is &s;uperlatively great and good&mdash;Why did &s;he not &s;eek all this in a le&s;s offen&s;ive way? Why did &s;he oblige me
<PB N="85" REF="86">
to become a di&s;putant with a plebeian?&mdash;Di&s;putant!&mdash;What do I &s;ay?&mdash;Wor&s;e, wor&s;e!&mdash;Rival!&mdash;Devil!&mdash;Myriads of virtues could not atone the crime!&mdash;Yet in this deep guilt &s;he per&s;everes and glories!&mdash;Can I forget?&mdash;Fear me not, nor rank my defeat among things po&s;|&s;ible&mdash;Be patient and lend an ear.</P>
<P>To one &s;ole object all my efforts point: her mind mu&s;t be prepared, ay &s;o that when the que&s;tion &s;hall be put, cha&s;te as that mind is, it &s;carcely &s;hall re|ceive a &s;hock. Such is the continual tendency of my di&s;cour&s;e. Her own open and undi&s;gui&s;ed manners are my guide. Not a principle &s;he maintains but which, by my cunning que&s;tions and affected doubts pu&s;hed to an extreme,
<PB N="86" REF="87">
adds links to the chain in which I mean to lead her captive.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Fairfax, you will tell me this is the old artifice; and that the minds of all women, who can be &s;aid to have any mind, mu&s;t thus be inveigled to think lightly of the thing they are about to lo&s;e. Granted. And yet the differ|ence is infinite. They are brought to think thus lightly of cha&s;tity: but, &s;hould you or any one of the gallant pha|lanx attempt to make Anna St. Ives &s;o think, &s;he would pre&s;ently cry buzz to the dull blockhead, and give him his eternal di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Virtue with her is a real exi&s;tence, and as &s;uch mu&s;t be adored. Her pa&s;|&s;ions are her &s;laves; and in this and
<PB N="87" REF="88">
this alone the lovely tyrant is the advo|cate of de&s;poti&s;m. She &s;oon taught me that common arts would be treated by her, not merely with determined and ir|revocable repul&s;e, but with direct con|tempt. Some very feeble e&s;&s;ays pre|&s;ently &s;atisfied me. No encroachments of the touch, no gloting of the eye, no well feigned tremblings and lover's pal|pitations would for an in&s;tant be &s;uffered by her. Take the following as a &s;peci|men of my mode of attack.</P>
<P>Among her variety of hypothe&s;es &s;he has one on mutability. <Q>Little, &s;he &s;ays, as we know of matter and &s;pirit, we &s;till know enough to perceive they are both in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, eternally, and infinitely changing. Of what the world has been, through this &s;eries of
<PB N="88" REF="89">
never beginning never ending muta|tion, &s;he can form nothing more than conjecture: yet &s;he cannot but think that the golden age is a &s;uppo&s;ition treated at pre&s;ent with ridicule it does not de&s;erve. By the laws of nece&s;&s;ity, mind, unle&s;s counteracted by acci|dents beyond its control, is conti|nually progre&s;&s;ive in improvement. With &s;ome &s;uch accidents we are tolerably well acquainted. Such are tho&s;e which have been de&s;tructive of its progre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the high attainments it had made in Greece and Rome. The ruins &s;till exi&s;ting in Egypt are wonderful proofs of what it once was there; though Egypt is at pre&s;ent almo&s;t unequalled in ig|norance and depravity. Who then
<PB N="89" REF="90">
&s;hall affirm changes &s;till more extraor|dinary have not happened? She has no doubt, &s;ome revolution in the pla|netary &s;y&s;tem excepted, that men will attain a much higher degree of inno|cence, length of life, happine&s;s, and wi&s;dom than have ever yet been dreamed of, either by hi&s;torian, fabu|li&s;t, or poet: for cau&s;es which for|merly were equal to the effects then produced are now rendered impotent by the glorious art of printing; which &s;preads, pre&s;erves, and multiplies knowledge, in de&s;pite of ignorance, fal&s;e zeal, and de&s;poti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>Such was her di&s;cour&s;e, and thus va&s;t were her views! Nay, urged on by my que&s;tions, by the con&s;equences which re|&s;ulted from her own doctrines, and by
<PB N="90" REF="91">
the ardour of emanating benevolence, &s;he a&s;toni&s;hed me by her &s;ublime vi&s;ions; for &s;he proceeded to prove, from &s;eem|ingly fair deduction, <Q>that men &s;hould finally render them&s;elves immortal; &s;hould become &s;carcely liable to moral mi&s;take; &s;hould all act from princi|ples previou&s;ly demon&s;trated, and therefore never contend; &s;hould be one great family without a ruler, be|cau&s;e in no need of being ruled; &s;hould be incapable of bodily pain or pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;hould expend their whole powers in tracing moral and phy&s;ical cau&s;e and effect; which, be|ing infinite in their &s;eries, will afford them infinite employment of the mo&s;t rational and delightful kind!</Q></P>
<P>Oh! How did the &s;weet enthu&s;ia&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="92">
glow, ay and make me glow too, while, with a daring but con&s;i&s;tent hand &s;he &s;ketched out this bold picture of illu|&s;ion!</P>
<P>But, while the lovely zealot thus de|&s;canted on &s;plendid and half incompre|hen&s;ible themes, what did I? Why, when I found her at the proper pitch, when I &s;aw benevolence and love of hu|man kind beaming with mo&s;t ardour in her eye, and pouring raptures from her lip, I then recalled her to her beloved golden age, her times of primitive &s;im|plicity; made her inform me what lovers then were, and what marriage; and what the bonds were which hearts &s;o affectionate and minds &s;o hone&s;t and pure demanded of each other.</P>
<P>What think you could her an&s;wers to

all the&s;e que&s;tions be? What but &s;uch as I wi&s;hed? Could lovers like the&s;e &s;u&s;pect each other? Could they ba&s;ely do the wrong to a&s;k for bond or pledge? Or, if they wanted the virtue to charm, could they &s;till more ba&s;ely a&s;k rewards they did not merit? Could they, with the wretched &s;elfi&s;h jealou&s;y of a modern marriage-maker, &s;eek to cadaverate af|fection and to pervert each other into a uten&s;il, a commodity, a thing appro|priate to &s;elf and liable with other lum|ber to be ca&s;t a&s;ide? No, Fairfax; &s;he played fairly and deeply into my hand. She created exactly &s;uch a pair of lovers as I could have de&s;ired: for with re&s;pect to the truth and con&s;tancy with which &s;he endowed them, if I can|not be the thing, I can wear the garb;

ay and it &s;hall become me too, &s;hall &s;it <HI>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</HI> upon me, and be thought my na|tive dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Think not that I am a mere li&s;tener: far the rever&s;e. I throw in ma&s;terly touches, which, while they &s;eem only to heighten her picture, produce the full effect by me intended. Thus, when &s;he de&s;cribed the faith and truth and love of the innocents of her own cre|ation, how did I declaim again&s;t the abu&s;e to which &s;uch doctrine, though immutably true, was liable!</P>
<P>"Alas! madam," &s;aid I, <Q>had the unprincipled youths with which the&s;e times abound your powers of argu|ment with their own principles, how dreadful would be the effect! How
<PB N="94" REF="95">
many un&s;u&s;pecting hearts would they betray!</Q></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>I am once more ju&s;t returned from the palace of Alcina! I broke off at the end of my la&s;t paragraph to attend my charmer; and here again am I de|te&s;ting my&s;elf for want of re&s;olution; and dete&s;ting my&s;elf &s;till more for hav|ing made a re&s;olution, for having un|dertaken that which I am &s;o eternally tempted to renounce. Your &s;neer and your laugh are both ready&mdash;I know you, Fairfax&mdash;"The gentleman is &s;ounding a retreat! The enterpri&s;e is too diffi|cult!"&mdash;No&mdash;I tell you no, no, no,&mdash;But
<PB N="95" REF="96">
I am almo&s;t afraid it is too dam|nable!</P>
<P>I pretended to be exceedingly anx|ious concerning the delay, and afflicted at not hearing any thing more from Sir Arthur. If I did not do this, it might be a clue to lead her to &s;u&s;pect hypo|cri&s;y, con&s;idering how very ardent I was at the commencement. And, to &s;ay the truth, I am weary enough of wait|ing; though it is not my wi&s;h to be re|lieved by any expedition of Sir Arthur's, who, as I hinted to you before, does not appear to be in the lea&s;t hurry, and who&s;e unction for the gardener's &s;on in|crea&s;es.</P>
<P>But had you heard her con&s;ole me! Had you &s;een her kindne&s;s! The tear gli&s;tening in her eye while &s;he entreated
<PB N="96" REF="97">
me to con&s;ider delay as a fortunate event, which tended to permanent and ineffable happine&s;s; had you I &s;ay beheld her &s;oul, for it was both vi&s;ible and audible, Fairfax though you are, the marauder of marriage land and the &s;worn foe of virginity, even you would have par|doned my tergiver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Did you never behold the &s;un bur&s;t forth from behind the riding clouds? The &s;cene that was gloomy, dark and di&s;mal is &s;uddenly illumined; what was ob&s;cure becomes con&s;picuous; the bleak hills &s;mile, the black meadows a&s;&s;ume a bright verdure; quaking &s;hadows dare no longer &s;tay, cold damps are di&s;pelled, and in an in&s;tant all is vi&s;ible, clear, and radiant! So vani&s;h doubts when &s;he begins to &s;peak! Thus in her pre|&s;ence
<PB N="97" REF="98">
do the feelings glow; and thus is gloom bani&s;hed from the &s;oul, till all is genial warmth and harmony!</P>
<P>The&s;e being my feelings now, when I am e&s;caped, when I am beyond the circle of her &s;orceries, think, Fairfax, be ju&s;t and think how &s;eductive, how dan|gerous an enemy I have to encounter&mdash;Li&s;ten and judge.</P>
<P>"Oh! Clifton"&mdash;She &s;peaks! Li&s;ten I &s;ay to her &s;pells!&mdash;<Q>Oh! Clifton, daily and hourly do I ble&s;s this happy accident, this delay! I think, with the heroic archbi&s;hop, I could have held my right hand firmly till the flames had con&s;umed it, could I but have brought to pa&s;s what this ble&s;&s;ed event has already almo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed! To behold your mind what
<PB N="98" REF="99">
it is and to recollect what it &s;o lately was is bli&s;s unutterable! I con&s;ider my&s;elf now as de&s;tined to be yours: but whether I am or am not is perhaps a thing of little moment. Let &s;elf be forgotten, and all its petty intere&s;ts! What am I? What can I be, com|pared to what you may become? The patriot, the legi&s;lator, the &s;tate&s;man, the reconciler of nations, the di&s;pen&s;er of truth, and the in&s;tructor of the hu|man race; for to all the&s;e you are equal. As for me, however ardent however great my good-will, I cannot have the &s;ame opportunities. Be&s;ide I mu&s;t be ju&s;t to my&s;elf and you, and it delights me to declare I believe you have a mind capable of conceptions more va&s;t than mine, of plans more

daring and &s;y&s;tems more deep, and of &s;oaring beyond me. You have the &s;trong memory, the keen &s;en&s;ibility and the rapid imagination which form the poet. It is my glory to repeat that your various powers, when called forth, have as variou&s;ly a&s;toni&s;hed me. To bid you per&s;evere were now to wrong you, for I think I dare affirm you cannot retreat. You have at pre|&s;ent &s;een too much, thought too much, known too much ever to forget. In private you will be the honour of your family and the delight of your wife; and in public the boa&s;t of your coun|try and the admiration of the virtuous and the wi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I fell on my knee to the &s;peaking deity! She &s;eemed delivering oracles!
<PB N="100" REF="101">
My pa&s;&s;ions ro&s;e, my heart was full, her eulogium made it loath and abhor its own deceit; the words&mdash;"Madam, I am a villain!"&mdash;bolted to my lips, there they quivering lingered in excruciating &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and at la&s;t &s;lunk back like cow|ards, half wi&s;hing but wholly a&s;hamed to do their office.</P>
<P>By the immortal powers, Fairfax, it was pa&s;t re&s;i&s;ting! Why &s;hould I not be all &s;he has de&s;cribed? The hero, the legi&s;lator, the great leader of this little world? Ay, why not? She &s;eemed to prophe&s;y. She has rai&s;ed a flame in me which, if encouraged, might fertilize or de&s;olate kingdoms. Body of Cae&s;ar, I know not what to &s;ay!</P>
<P>'Tis true &s;he has treated me ill; nay vilely. It cannot be denied. But ill
<PB N="101" REF="102">
treatment it&s;elf, from her, is &s;uperior to all the mauki&s;h kindne&s;s which folly and caprice endeavour to lavi&s;h. Fairfax, would you did but behold her! My heart was never &s;o a&s;&s;ailed before!</P>
<P>My re&s;olution is &s;haken, I own, but it is not obliterated. No; I will think again. My very &s;oul is repugnant to the &s;uppo&s;ition of leaving its envenomed tumours una&s;&s;uaged, and its angered &s;tabs unavenged. Yet, if healed they could be, &s;he &s;urely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that healing art&mdash;Once more I will think again.</P>
<P>What you tell me in the Po&s;t&s;cript to your la&s;t concerning Count Caduke [Con&s;ult your dictionary; or to &s;ave your&s;elf trouble read Count Crazy, alias Beaunoir.] is wholly unintelligible to

me. But as you &s;ay the name of the gardener's &s;on was &s;everal times men|tioned by him, I &s;hall take an immediate opportunity of interrogating the '&s;quire of &s;hrubs, who I am certain from prin|ciple will when a&s;ked tell me all he knows.</P>
<P>Apropos of poetry. The panegyric of this &s;ylph of the &s;un-beams gave me an impul&s;e which I could not re&s;i&s;t, and the following was the offspring of my headlong and impetuous mu&s;e; for &s;uch the hu&s;&s;ey is whenever the fit is upon her.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WITHIN a week, Oliver, we &s;hall once more meet. What years of &s;epa|ration may afterward follow is more than I can divine. I &s;urely need not tell thee that this thought of &s;eparation, were it not oppo&s;ed by principle, would indeed be painful, and that it is at moments al|mo&s;t
<PB N="107" REF="108">
too mighty for principle it&s;elf. But we are the creatures of an omnipotent nece&s;&s;ity; and there can be but little need to remind thee that a compliance with the apparently be&s;t &s;hould ever be an unrepining and cheerful act of duty.</P>
<P>I have had a conver&s;ation with Sir Arthur, very &s;ingular in its kind, which has again awakened &s;en&s;ations in their full force that had previou&s;ly co&s;t me many bitter &s;truggles to allay. I began with informing him of my intention to go down to Wenbourne-Hill; after which I proceeded to tell him it was my de&s;ign to embark for America.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;aid he hoped not.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered I had reflected very fully on the plan, and that I believed it was
<PB N="108" REF="109">
&s;carcely probable any rea&s;on &s;hould oc|cur which could induce me to change my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The thing, he replied, might perhaps not be &s;o entirely improbable as I &s;up|po&s;ed. His family had great obligations to me. I had even ri&s;ked my life on various occa&s;ions for them. They thought my talents very extraordinary. In fine, Oliver, the good old gentleman endeavoured to &s;ay all the kind and, as he deemed them, grateful things his memory could &s;upply; and added that, &s;hould I leave England without afford|ing them &s;ome opportunity to repay their obligations, they &s;hould be much grieved. There were perhaps two or three very great difficulties in the way; but &s;till he was not &s;ure they might not
<PB N="109" REF="110">
be overcome. Not that he could &s;ay any thing po&s;itively, for matters were he mu&s;t own in a very doubtful &s;tate. He was him&s;elf indeed very con&s;iderably unea&s;y, and undetermined: but he cer|tainly wi&s;hed me exceedingly well, and &s;o with equal certainty at pre&s;ent did all his family. His daughter, his &s;on, him|&s;elf, were all my debtors.</P>
<P>The good old gentleman's heart overflowed, Oliver, and by its ebul|litions rai&s;ed a tumult in mine, which required every energy it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to repel. What could I an&s;wer, but that I had done no more for his fa|mily than what it was my duty to do for the greate&s;t &s;tranger; and that, if gratitude be under&s;tood to mean a
<PB N="110" REF="111">
remembrance of favours received, I and my family had for years indu|bitably been the receivers?</P>
<P>He &s;till per&s;i&s;ted however in endea|vouring to di&s;&s;uade me from the thought of quitting the kingdom. Not finding me convinced by his arguments, he he|&s;itated, with an evident de&s;ire to &s;ay &s;omething which he knew not very well how to begin. All minds on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions are under &s;trong impul&s;es. My own wi&s;h that he &s;hould be explicit was eager, and I excited him to proceed. At la&s;t he a&s;ked if he might put a que&s;|tion to me; a&s;&s;uring me it was far from his intention to offend, but that he had &s;ome unea&s;y doubts which he could be very glad to have removed.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112">
I de&s;ired him to interrogate me freely; and to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf that I would be guilty of no di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>He knew my &s;incerity, he &s;aid; but if when I heard I &s;hould think any thing in what he a&s;ked improper, I pa&s;t di&s;|pute had a right to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered that I &s;u&s;pected or rather was convinced I had no &s;uch right, and reque&s;ted him to begin.</P>
<P>He again &s;tammered, and at la&s;t &s;aid&mdash;I think, Mr. Henley, I have remarked &s;ome degree of e&s;teem between you and my daughter&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topped&mdash;His de&s;ire not to wound my feelings was &s;o evident that I de|termined to relieve him, and replied&mdash;</P>
<P>I believe, &s;ir, I can now divine the &s;ubject of your que&s;tion. You would
<PB N="112" REF="113">
be glad to know if any thing have pa&s;&s;ed between us, and what? Perhaps you ought to have been told without a&s;king; but I am certain that concealment at pre|&s;ent would be highly wrong.</P>
<P>I then repeated as accurately as my memory would permit, which is tole|rably tenacious on this fubject, all which Anna and I had reciprocally &s;aid and done. It was impo&s;&s;ible, Oliver, to make this recapitulation with apathy. My feelings were awakened, and I a&s;|&s;ure thee the emotions of Sir Arthur were as lively as in &s;uch a mind thou could&s;t well &s;uppo&s;e. The human heart &s;eems to be meliorated and &s;oftened by age. He wept, a thing with him cer|tainly not u&s;ual, at the recital of his daughter's heroic re&s;olves in favour of
<PB N="113" REF="114">
duty, and at her re&s;pect for parental pre|judices. Her dread of rendering him unhappy made him even &s;ob, and bur&s;t into frequent interjections of&mdash;<Q>She is a dear girl! She is a heavenly girl! I always loved her! She is the de|light of my life, my &s;oul's trea&s;ure! From her infancy to this hour, &s;he was always an angel!</Q></P>
<P>After hearing me fully confirm him in his e&s;teem and affection for &s;o &s;u|perlative a daughter, he added&mdash;You tell me, Mr. Henley, that you freely informed my daughter you thought it was even her duty to prefer you to all mankind, even though her fa|ther and friends &s;hould di&s;approve the match.</P>
<P>I did, &s;ir. I &s;poke from conviction,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
and &s;hould have thought my&s;elf culpable had I been &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o. But that is very uncom|mon doctrine.</P>
<P>It was not merely that more felicity would have been &s;ecured to our&s;elves, but greater good I &s;uppo&s;ed would re|&s;ult to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I have heard you explain things of that kind before. I do not very well under&s;tand them, but give me leave to a&s;k&mdash;Are you &s;till of the &s;ame opi|nion?</P>
<P>I am, &s;ir.&mdash;Not that I am &s;o confi|dent as I was&mdash;Mr. Clifton has a very a&s;toni&s;hing &s;trength of mind: and, &s;hould it be turned to the worthy pur|po&s;es of which it is capable, I dare by no means decide po&s;itively in my own
<PB N="115" REF="116">
favour: and the deci&s;ion which I now make again&s;t him is the re&s;ult of the intimate acquaintance which I mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have with my own heart, added to certain dubious appearances as to his which I know not how to reconcile. Of my&s;elf I am &s;ecure.</P>
<P>And of him you have &s;ome doubts?</P>
<P>I have: but I ought in duty to add the appearances of their being unju&s;t are daily &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur pau&s;ed, ruminated, and again &s;eemed embarra&s;&s;ed. At la&s;t he owned he knew not what to &s;ay: turn which way he would the ob&s;tacles were very con&s;iderable. His mind had really felt more di&s;tre&s;s, within the&s;e two months, than it had ever known before. He could re&s;olve on nothing. Yet he
<PB N="116" REF="117">
could not but wi&s;h I had not been quite &s;o determined on going to America. There was no &s;aying what cour&s;e things might take. Mrs. Clifton was very ill, and in all probability could not live long. But again he knew not what to &s;ay. He certainly wi&s;hed me very well&mdash;Very well&mdash;I was an uncommon young man. I was a gentleman by na|ture, which for aught he knew might be better than a gentleman by birth. The world had its opinions; perhaps they were ju&s;t, perhaps unju&s;t. He had been u&s;ed to think with the world, but he had heard &s;o much lately that he was not quite &s;o po&s;itive as he had been&mdash;[This, Oliver, reminded me of the power of truth; how it &s;aps the &s;trong holds of error and winds into the heart,
<PB N="117" REF="118">
and how ince&s;&s;antly its advocates ought to propagate it on every occa&s;ion.] He was not quite &s;o well plea&s;ed as he had been with my father, but that was no fault of mine; he knew I had a very different manner of thinking. Still he mu&s;t &s;ay it was what he very little ex|pected. He hoped however that things would one way or other go more &s;moothly; and he concluded with taking my hand, pre&s;&s;ing it very warmly, and adding with con&s;iderable earne&s;tne&s;s&mdash;<Q>If you can think of changing your American project, pray do!&mdash;Pray do!&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>After which he left me with &s;ome|thing like a heavy heart.</P>
<P>And now, Oliver, how ought I to act? The oppo&s;ing cau&s;es of the&s;e doubts and
<PB N="118" REF="119">
difficulties in his mind are evident. The circum&s;tances which have occurred in my favour, being aided by the ob&s;tinate &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of my father, by his acquired wealth, and as I &s;uppo&s;e by the em|broiled &s;tate of Sir Arthur's affairs, have produced an unhoped &s;or revolution in the &s;entiments of Sir Arthur. But is it not too late? Are not even the mo&s;t tragical con&s;equences to be feared from an oppo&s;ition to Clifton? Nay, if his mind be what his words and behaviour &s;peak, would not oppo&s;ition be unju&s;t? Were it not better with &s;evere but vir|tuous re&s;olution to repel the&s;e flattering and probably deceitful hopes, than by encouraging them to feed the can|ker-worm of peace, and add new force to the enemy within, who rather
<PB N="119" REF="120">
&s;tunned than conquered is every moment ready to revive.</P>
<P>Neither is Sir Arthur ma&s;ter of events. Nor is his mind con&s;i&s;tent enough to be in no danger of change.</P>
<P>My heart is &s;ufficiently prone to in|dulge oppo&s;ite &s;entiments, but it mu&s;t be &s;ilenced; it mu&s;t li&s;ten to the voice of truth.</P>
<P>Did I but better under&s;tand this Clif|ton, I &s;hould better know how to decide. That he looks up to her with admiration I am convinced. She &s;eems to have di&s;|covered the true key to his under&s;tand|ing as well as to his affections. Even within this day or two, I have ob&s;erved &s;ymptoms very much in his favour. How do I know but thus influenced he may become the fir&s;t of mankind? The
<PB N="120" REF="121">
thought re&s;tores me to a &s;en&s;e of right. Never, Oliver, &s;hall &s;elf complacency make me guilty of what cannot but be a crime mo&s;t heinous! If &s;uch a mind may by the&s;e means be gained which would otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t, &s;hall it be ex|tingui&s;hed by me? Would not an a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination like this outweigh thou|&s;ands of common murders? Well may I &s;hudder at &s;uch an act! Oliver, I am re&s;olved. If there be power in words or in rea&s;on my father &s;hall comply.</P>
<P>As far as I under&s;tand the human mind, there is and even &s;hould he per|&s;evere there always mu&s;t be &s;omething to me enigmatical in this in&s;tance of its efforts in Clifton. Per&s;evere however I mo&s;t &s;incerely hope and even believe he
<PB N="121" REF="122">
will.&mdash;But &s;hould he not?&mdash;The &s;uppo|&s;ition is dreadful!&mdash;Anna St. Ives!&mdash;My heart &s;inks within me!&mdash;Can virtue like hers be vulnerable?&mdash;Surely not!&mdash;The more pure a woman is in principle the more &s;ecure would &s;he be from common &s;educers. But, if the man can be found who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the nece&s;&s;ary though apparently incompatible exce&s;s of folly and wi&s;dom, there is a mode by which &s;uch a woman is more open to the arts of deceit than any other. And is not that woman Anna St. Ives? Nay more, if he be not a prodigy of even a &s;till more extraordinary kind, is not that man Coke Clifton?</P>
<P>He came in the heyday of youthful pride, &s;elf-&s;atisfied, &s;elf-convinced, root|ed
<PB N="122" REF="123">
in prejudice but abundant in ideas. Argument made no impre&s;&s;ion; for where he ought to have li&s;tened he laughed. The weapons of wit never failed him; and, while he lanched them at others, they recoiled and continually lacerated him&s;elf. Of this he was in|&s;en&s;ible: he felt them not, or felt them but little. His haughtine&s;s never &s;lum|bered; and to oppo&s;e him was to irri|tate, not convince.

<P>Clifton has ju&s;t been with me.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALAS! Loui&s;a, what are we?&mdash;What are our affections, what our re|&s;olves? Taken at unguarded moments, agitated, hurried away by pa&s;&s;ion, how &s;eldom have we for a day together rea|&s;on to be &s;atisfied with our conduct?</P>
<P>Not plea&s;ed with my&s;elf, I doubt I
<PB N="127" REF="128">
have given cau&s;e of di&s;plea&s;ure to your brother. My father was in part the oc|ca&s;ion: for a moment he made me for|get my&s;elf&mdash;Loui&s;a!&mdash;Frank Henley is going to America! He does not lightly re&s;olve, and his re&s;olution &s;eems fixed!&mdash;Good God!&mdash;I&mdash;Loui&s;a!&mdash;I am afraid I am a guilty creature!&mdash;Weak!&mdash;Very weak!&mdash;And is not weak|ne&s;s guilt?&mdash;But why &s;hould he leave us?&mdash;Where will he find hearts more alive to his worth?</P>
<P>Sir Arthur came to inform me of it: he had been conver&s;ing with him, and had endeavoured but without effect to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e. He came and begged me to try. I per|haps might be more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="129">
There was a marked &s;ignificance in his manner, and I a&s;ked him why?</P>
<P>Nay, my dear child, &s;aid he, and his heart &s;eemed full, you know why. Mr. Henley has told me why.</P>
<P>What, &s;ir, has he told?</P>
<P>Nothing, child&mdash;[Sir Arthur took my hand]&mdash;Nothing, but what is honourable to you&mdash;I que&s;tioned him, and you know he is never guilty of fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>No, &s;ir; he is incapable of it.</P>
<P>Well, Anna, try then to per&s;uade him not to leave us. Though he is a very excellent young man, I am afraid he has not the be&s;t of fathers. I be|gin to feel I have not been &s;o pru|dent as I might have been; and, if Mr.
<PB N="129" REF="130">
Henley were to leave England, the fa|ther might attribute it to us, and&mdash;[Sir Arthur he&s;itated]&mdash;I have received &s;ome extraordinary letters from Abime|lech, of which I did not at fir&s;t &s;ee the full drift; but it is now clear; every thing corre&s;ponds, and my conver&s;ation with young Mr. Henley has confirmed all I had &s;uppo&s;ed. However he is a very good a very extraordinary young gentleman, and I could wi&s;h he would not go. I don't know what may hap|pen.</P>
<P>Your brother came in and Sir Arthur left me, de&s;iring me as he went to re|member what he had &s;aid. Clifton after an apology a&s;ked&mdash;Does it relate to me? At that moment Frank entered. No, &s;aid I; it relates to one who I did not
<PB N="130" REF="131">
think would have been &s;o ready to for|&s;ake his friends!</P>
<P>A thou&s;and thoughts had crowded to my mind; a dread of having u&s;ed him ungenerou&s;ly, unju&s;tly; a recollection of all he had done and all he had &s;uf|fered; his enquiring, penetrating, and unbounded genius; his &s;uperlative vir|tues; a horror of his being bani&s;hed his native country by me; of his wandering among &s;trangers, expo&s;ed to poverty, perils, and death, with the conviction in his heart that I had done him wrong!&mdash;My tumultuous feelings ru&s;hed upon me, overpowered me, and in a moment of enthu&s;ia&s;m I ran to him, &s;natched his hand, fell on my knee and exclaimed&mdash;"For the love of God, Mr. Henley, do not think of leaving us!"</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132">
Clifton like my&s;elf could not con|quer the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault of pa&s;&s;ion: he pro|nounced the word madam! in a tone mingled with &s;urpri&s;e and &s;evere energy, which recalled me to my&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>You &s;ee, &s;aid I, turning to him, what an unworthy weak creature I am!&mdash;But Mr. Henley has taken the &s;trange&s;t re|&s;olution&mdash;!</P>
<P>What, madam, &s;aid your brother, re|covering him&s;elf, and with &s;ome plea|&s;antry, is he for a voyage to the moon? Or does he wait the arrival of the next comet, to make the tour of the univer&s;e?</P>
<P>Nay, an&s;wered I, you mu&s;t join me, and not treat my poor petition with ri|dicule&mdash;You mu&s;t not go, Mr. Henley; indeed you mu&s;t not! I, Mr. Clifton, my father, my brother, we will none of
<PB N="132" REF="133">
us hear of it! We are all your debtors, and it would be unju&s;t in you to deprive us of every opportunity of te&s;tifying our friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Your brother, Loui&s;a, made an effort worthy of him&s;elf, repre&s;&s;ed the error of his fir&s;t feelings, a&s;&s;umed the gentle a&s;pect of entreaty, and kindly joined me.</P>
<P>We are indeed your debtors, &s;aid he to Mr. Henley. But I hope it is not true. I hope there is no danger that you &s;hould for&s;ake us. Where would you go? Where can you be &s;o happy?</P>
<P>I mean fir&s;t, replied Frank, to go to Wenbourne Hill; and after that my in|tentions are for America.</P>
<P>This, Loui&s;a, brought on a long di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. I and your brother both en|deavoured
<PB N="133" REF="134">
to convince him it was his duty to remain in England; that he could be more &s;erviceable here, and would find better opportunities for ef|fecting that good which he had &s;o warmly at heart than in any other country.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered that, though he was not convinced by our arguments, he &s;hould think it his duty &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider them. But we could not make him promi&s;e any thing further. Previous to his return from Wenbourne Hill he would determine.</P>
<P>Indeed, Loui&s;a, this affair lies very heavily upon my mind. I am ince&s;|&s;antly accu&s;ing my&s;elf as the cau&s;e of his exile. And am I not? By the manner of Sir Arthur I am &s;ure he mu&s;t
<PB N="134" REF="135">
have &s;aid &s;omething very highly in my prai&s;e. I have gone too far with your brother to recede: that is now impo&s;&s;ible. It would be more flagrant inju&s;tice than even the wrong to Frank, if a wrong it be, and indeed, Loui&s;a, I dread it is!&mdash;Indeed I do!&mdash;I dread it even with a kind of horror!</P>
<P>I thought rea&s;on would have appea&s;ed the&s;e doubts ere this; but every occa|&s;ion I find calls them forth with unabated vigour. Surely this mental blindne&s;s mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of neglect. Had we but the will, the determination, it might be removed. Oh how reprehen&s;ible is my incon&s;i&s;tency!</P>
<P>The rapid decline of Mrs. Clifton grieves me deeply. Your brother too has frequently mentioned it with feelings
<PB N="135" REF="136">
honourable to his heart. He is now more than ever &s;en&s;ible of her worth. He has been with me &s;ince I began to write this letter, and there is not the lea&s;t appearance of remaining umbrage on his mind. It was indeed but of &s;hort duration, though too &s;trong and &s;udden not to be apparent.</P>
<P>All kindne&s;s, peace, and felicity be with you.</P>

<HEAD>COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Dover Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL cur&s;e no more, Fairfax. Or, if cur&s;e I do, it &s;hall be at my own fatuity. I will not be the dilatory, lan|guid, ranting, moralizing Hamlet of the drama; that has the vengeance of hell upon his lips and the charity of hea|ven
<PB N="137" REF="138">
in his heart. I will u&s;e not &s;peak daggers&mdash;</P>
<P>Fairfax, I am mad!&mdash;Raging!&mdash;The &s;mothered and pent-up mania mu&s;t have vent&mdash;What! Was not the page &s;ufficiently black before?&mdash;I am amazed at my own infatuation! My very &s;oul &s;purns at it!&mdash;But 'tis pa&s;t&mdash;Deceitful, damned &s;ex!&mdash;Idiot that I was, I be|gan to fancy my&s;elf beloved!&mdash;I!&mdash;Blind, deaf, in&s;en&s;ate driveler!&mdash;Torpid, blocki&s;h, brainle&s;s mammet!&mdash;Mo&s;t &s;ublime a&s;s!&mdash;Oh for a bib and barley &s;ugar, with the label <HI>Meacock</HI> pinned be|fore and behind!&mdash;</P>
<P>Fairfax, I never can forgive my own ab&s;urd and de&s;picable &s;tupidity!&mdash;Mar|riage?&mdash;What, with a woman in who&s;e eye the perfect impre&s;&s;ion and hated
<PB N="138" REF="139">
form of a mean rival is depicted?&mdash;In colours glowing hot!&mdash;Who lives, re|vels, triumphs in her heart!&mdash;I marry &s;uch a woman?&mdash;I?&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>I had rather be a toad,</L>
<L>And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,</L>
<L>Than keep a corner in the thing I love</L>
<L>For other's u&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>I am too full of phren&s;y, Fairfax, to tell thee what I mean: but &s;he has given me another proof, more damning even than all the former, of the gluttony with which her &s;oul gorges. Her gloating eye devours him; ay, I being pre&s;ent. Nay, were I this moment in her arms, her arms would be cla&s;ping him, not me: with him &s;he would carou&s;e, nor would any thing like me exi&s;t&mdash;Conta|gion!&mdash;Poi&s;on and boiling oil!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
Never before was patience &s;o put to the proof&mdash;My danger was extreme. With rage flaming in my heart, I was obliged to wear complacency, &s;atisfac|tion and &s;miles on my countenance.</P>
<P>The fellow has determined to &s;hip him&s;elf for America&mdash;Would it were for the bottomle&s;s pit!&mdash;And had you be|held her panic?&mdash;St. Luke's collected maniacs at the full of the moon could not have equalled her!&mdash;'Twas well in|deed her frantic outrage was &s;o violent, or I had been detected and all had been lo&s;t&mdash;As it was I half betrayed my&s;elf&mdash;The fellow's eye glanced at me. How|ever it gave me my cue; and, all things con&s;idered, I afterward performed to a miracle. Her own enthu&s;ia&s;tic torrent &s;wept all before it, and gave me time.
<PB N="140" REF="141">
She was in an ec&s;ta&s;y; rea&s;oning, &s;up|plicating, conjuring, panting. I, her friends, the whole world mu&s;t join her: and join her I did. It was the very re|lief of which hypocri&s;y &s;tood in need. I entreated this &s;traight-backed youth, &s;tiff in determination, to conde&s;cend to lend a pitying ear to our petitions; to &s;uffer us to permeate his bowels of com|pa&s;&s;ion, and avert this fatal and impend|ing cloud, fraught with evils, mi&s;ery, and mi&s;chief&mdash;</P>
<P>But marry no!&mdash;It could not be!&mdash;Sentence was pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;He had been at the trouble to make a pair of &s;cales, and knew the weight to a &s;cruple of every link in the whole chain of cau&s;e and ef|fect&mdash;Teach him, truly!&mdash;Advi&s;ehim!&mdash;Move him!&mdash;When? Who? How?&mdash;At
<PB N="141" REF="142">
la&s;t compliance, willing to be royally gracious, &s;aid, Well it would con&s;ider&mdash;Though there was but little hope&mdash;No|thing it had heard had any cogency of per&s;crutation&mdash;But, in fine, it would be clement, and con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Do you not &s;ee this fellow, Fairfax? Is he not now before your eyes? Is he not the mo&s;t con&s;ummate&mdash;?But why do I trouble my&s;elf a moment about him?&mdash;It is her!&mdash;Her!&mdash;</P>
<P>Nor is this all. Did that devil that mo&s;t delights in mi&s;chief direct every concurring circum&s;tance, they could not all and each be more uniform, more co|ercive to the one great end. This poor dotterel, Sir Arthur, is playing fa&s;t and loo&s;e with me. He has been at his &s;oundings&mdash;He!&mdash;Imbecile animal!&mdash;Could wi&s;h there were not &s;o many dif|ficulties&mdash;Is
<PB N="142" REF="143">
afraid they cannot be all removed&mdash;Has his doubts and his fears&mdash;Twenty thou&s;and pounds is a large &s;um, and Mrs. Clifton is very po&s;itive&mdash;His own affairs much le&s;s promi&s;ing than he &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;Then by a declen&s;ion of hems, hums, and has, he de&s;cended to young Mr. Henley&mdash;A very extraordi|nary young gentleman!&mdash;A very &s;ur|pri&s;ing youth!&mdash;One made on purpo&s;e as it were for plum-cake days, high fe&s;tivals, and raree &s;how!&mdash;A prodigy!&mdash;Not begotten, born or bred in the dull blind-man's-buff way of &s;imple procrea|tion; but &s;ent us on a Sunday morning down Jacob's ladder!&mdash;Then for obliga|tions to him, count them who could!&mdash;He mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;tudy more arithmetic!&mdash;And as for affection it was a very way|ward
<PB N="143" REF="144">
thing&mdash;Not always in people's power&mdash;There was no knowing what was be&s;t&mdash;The hand might be given and the heart be wanting&mdash;And with re&s;pect to whether the opinions of the world ought to be regarded, good truth he knew not. Marry! The world was much more ready to blame others than to amend it|&s;elf: and he had been almo&s;t lately per&s;uaded not to care a fico for the world. But for his part he was a godly chri&s;tian, and wi&s;hed all for the be&s;t. He had faith, hope, and charity, which were enough for one.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, Fairfax, the poor dotard would have dared to betray him|&s;elf thus far, had not I pre&s;ently per|ceived his drift and wormed him of
<PB N="144" REF="145">
the&s;e di&s;mal cogitations of the &s;pirit. He beat about, and hovered, and flut|tered, and chirped mournfully, like the poor infatuated bird that beholds the &s;erpent's mouth open, into which it is immediately to drop and be devoured. However, having begun, I was deter|mined to make him unburden his whole heart. If hereafter he can po&s;&s;ibly find courage to face me, in order to re|proach, I have my le&s;&s;on ready. <Q>Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, &s;inner.</Q></P>
<P>Gangrened as my heart is, I &s;till find a &s;atisfaction in this &s;elf convale&s;cence. The lady of mellifluous &s;peech &s;hall &s;uborn no more; no more &s;hall lull me into beatific &s;lumbers. I have recovered
<PB N="145" REF="146">
from my trance, and what I dreamed was cele&s;tial I will demon&s;trate to be mere woman.</P>
<P>From his own lips I learn that this in|&s;olent &s;coundrel received a vi&s;it from the Count de Beaunoir, which was in|tended for me: and, out of tender pity to my body, le&s;t, God 'ild us, it &s;hould get a drilling, he did be&s;tow &s;ome trifle of that wit and rea&s;on of which he has &s;o great a &s;uperflux upon the Count, thereby to turn a&s;ide his wrathful ire.</P>
<P>I heard the gentleman tell his tale, and tickle his imagination with the re|membrance of his own doctiloquy, with infinite compo&s;ure; and, whenever I put a que&s;tion, took care fir&s;t to pre|pare a &s;mile. Every thing was well, better could not be.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147">
With re&s;pect to <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Comte,</HI> I'll take &s;ome opportunity to whi&s;per a word in his ear. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, Fairfax, but that I may vi&s;it Paris even within this fortnight. Not that I can pretend to predict. They &s;hall not think I fly them, &s;hould any &s;oul among them dare to dream of vengeance. I know the Count to be as vain of his &s;kill in the &s;word as he is of his pair of watch &s;trings, his Paris-Birmingham &s;nuff-box, or the bauble that glitters on his finger. I think I can give him a le&s;&s;on: at lea&s;t I mean to try.</P>
<P>My mother's health declines apace. I know not whether it may not &s;hortly be nece&s;&s;ary for me to vi&s;it her. The lo&s;s of her will afflict me, but in all ap|pearance
<PB N="147" REF="148">
it is inevitable, and I fear not far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Once more, Fairfax, &s;hould you again fall in company with the Count, and he &s;hould give him&s;elf the mo&s;t trifling airs, a&s;&s;ure him that I will do my&s;elf the honour to embrace him within a month at farthe&s;t from that date, be it when it will.</P>

<P>HE is gone, Loui&s;a; has left us; his purpo&s;e unchanged, his heart op|pre&s;&s;ed, and his mind intent on promot|ing the happine&s;s of tho&s;e by whom he is exiled. And what am I, or who, that I &s;hould do him this violence?
<PB N="149" REF="150">
What validity have the&s;e arguments of rank, relation&s;hip, and the world's oppro|brium? Are they ju&s;t? He refuted them: &s;o he thought, and &s;o <HI>per&s;i&s;ts</HI> to think. And who was ever le&s;s partial, or more &s;evere to him&s;elf?</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, my mind is greatly di&s;turbed. His high virtues, the exertion of them for the peculiar protection of me and my family, and the dread of committing an act of unpardonable inju&s;tice, if un|ju&s;t it be, are images that haunt and tan|talize me ince&s;&s;antly.</P>
<P>If my conclu&s;ions have been fal&s;e, and if his a&s;&s;erted claims be true, how &s;hall I an&s;wer tho&s;e which I have brought upon my&s;elf? The claims of your bro|ther, which he urges without remi&s;&s;ion, are &s;till &s;tronger. They have been
<PB N="150" REF="151">
countenanced, admitted, and encou|raged. I cannot recede. What can I do but hope, ardently hope, Frank Hen|ley is in an error, and that he him&s;elf may make the di&s;covery? Yet how long and fruitle&s;s have the&s;e hopes been! My dilemma is extreme; for, if I have been mi&s;taken, act how I will, extreme mu&s;t be the wrong I commit!</P>
<P>Little did I imagine a moment &s;o full of bitter doubt and di&s;tru&s;t as this could come. Were I but &s;atisfied of the rec|titude of my deci&s;ion, there are no &s;en|&s;ations which I could not &s;tifle, no af|fections which I could not calm, nor any wandering wi&s;hes but what I could re|prove to &s;ilence. But the dread of a flagrant, an odious inju&s;tice di&s;tracts me, and I know not where or of whom to
<PB N="151" REF="152">
&s;eek con&s;olation. Even my Loui&s;a, the warm friend of my heart, cannot deter|mine in my favour.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>Your brother has been with me. He found me in tears, enquired the cau&s;e, and truth demanded a full and unequi|vocal confidence. I &s;hewed him what I had been writing. You may well ima|gine, Loui&s;a, he did not read it with to|tal apathy. But he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his own feelings with endeavours to give relief to mine. He argued to &s;hew me my motives had been highly virtuous. He would not &s;ay&mdash;[His candour delighted me, Loui&s;a.]&mdash;He would not &s;ay there was no ground for my fears: he was in|tere&s;ted and might be partial. He be|lieved
<PB N="152" REF="153">
indeed I had acted in &s;trict con|formity to the pure&s;t principles; but, had I even been mi&s;taken, the origin of my mi&s;take was &s;o dignified as totally to deprive the act of all po&s;&s;ible turpitude.</P>
<P>He was &s;oothing and kind, gave high encomiums to Frank, took blame to him|&s;elf for the error of his former opinions, and, reminding me of the motives which fir&s;t induced me to think of him, ten|derly a&s;ked if I had any new or recent cau&s;e to be weary of my ta&s;k.</P>
<P>What could I an&s;wer? What, but that I was delighted with the rapid change perceptible in his &s;entiments, and with the ardour with which his en|quiries were continued?</P>
<P>Frank Henley is by this time at Wenbourne Hill. You will &s;ee him.
<PB N="153" REF="154">
Plead our cau&s;e, Loui&s;a: urge him to remain among us. Conde&s;cend even to enforce my &s;elfi&s;h motive, that he would not leave me under the torturing &s;uppo|&s;ition of having bani&s;hed him from a country which he was born to enlighten, reform, and ble&s;s!</P>
<P>There is indeed another argument; but I know not whether it ought to be mentioned. Sir Arthur owns he is in the power of the avaricious Abimelech, and I believe is in dread of foreclo&s;ures that might even eject him from Wen|bourne Hill. This man mu&s;t have been an early and a deep adventurer in the trade of u&s;ury, or he never could have gained wealth &s;o great as he ap|pears to have ama&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Pa&s;t incidents, with all of which you
<PB N="154" REF="155">
are acquainted, have given Sir Arthur a high opinion of Frank: and this added to his own fears, I am per&s;uaded, would lead him to con&s;ider a union between us at pre&s;ent with complacency, were not &s;uch an inclination oppo&s;ed by other circum&s;tances. The open encourage|ment that he him&s;elf has given to Clifton is one, and it is &s;trengthened by all the intere&s;t of the other branches of our fa|mily. Your brother is highly in favour with Lord Fitz Allen. My aunt Wen|bourne equally approves the match, and Clifton and my brother Edward are become intimate. As to me, rea&s;on, con&s;i&s;tency, and my own forward con|duct, oblige me to be the enemy of Frank.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, I &s;carcely know what I write!
<PB N="155" REF="156">
Think not I have abandoned my&s;elf to the capricious gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion; or that my love of uncontaminated and rigorous virtue is le&s;&s;ened. No, it is indeci&s;ion; it is an abhorrence of inju&s;tice which &s;hake and di&s;quiet me.</P>
<P>Write to me; let me know your &s;entiments; and particularly how far your application to Frank, when you have made it, is &s;ucce&s;sful. I am anx|ious to receive your letter, for I know it will in&s;pire fortitude, of which I am in great, great need.</P>

<P>OH my deare&s;t and ever dear Anna, what &s;hall I &s;ay, how &s;hall I a&s;&s;uage doubts that take birth in principles &s;o pure and a heart &s;o void of guile? I know not. I have before acknowledged the mi&s;t is too thick for me to pene|trate.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
The worthy the noble-minded Frank has been with us, and I could devi&s;e no better way than to &s;hew him your letter. He was greatly moved, and collecting all the firmne&s;s of his &s;oul re&s;olutely de|clared that, &s;ince your peace was &s;o deeply concerned, be his own &s;en&s;ations what they might, he would conquer them and remain in England. The heart-felt applau&s;e he be&s;towed upon you was almo&s;t in&s;upportably affecting. He has indeed a deep &s;en&s;e of your un|common worth; and he alone I fear on earth is capable of doing it ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But things have taken a different turn; and what can the be&s;t of us do, when involved as we continually are in doubt and difficulty, but act as you do,
<PB N="158" REF="159">
with impartial &s;elf denial, and the mo&s;t rigid regard to truth and virtue?</P>
<P>Alas, dear Anna, I too am in need of &s;upport, and in &s;earch of fortitude!&mdash;My mother!&mdash;She will not be long among us!&mdash;A heart more benevolent, a mind more exalted&mdash;! She calls!&mdash;I hear her feeble voice!&mdash;Not even my Anna mu&s;t rob her of my company, for tho&s;e few remaining moments &s;he has yet to come. I am her la&s;t con&s;olation.</P>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR generous and zealous friend has thought proper to &s;hew me your let|ter. I will not attempt to de&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ations it excited; but, as your peace of mind is precious to me, and more precious &s;till perhaps to the intere&s;ts of
<PB N="160" REF="161">
&s;ociety, and &s;ince my departure would occa&s;ion alarms and doubts &s;o &s;trong, I am determined to &s;tay. My motives for going I thought too forcible and well founded to be overpowered; nor could they perhaps have been vanqui&s;hed by any le&s;s cau&s;e. If one of us mu&s;t &s;uffer the warfare of contending &s;entiments and principles, let it be me. It was to fly from and if po&s;&s;ible forget or &s;ubdue them that I projected &s;uch a voyage. Our duties to &s;ociety mu&s;t not cede to any effeminate compa&s;&s;ion for our&s;elves. We are both enough acquainted with tho&s;e duties to render us more than com|monly culpable, &s;hould we be guilty of neglect.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe my weakne&s;s, and the contention to which my pa&s;&s;ions have
<PB N="161" REF="162">
been lately &s;ubject, might tend to awaken emotions in you which ought to be e&s;tranged from your mind. Our lot is ca&s;t: let us &s;eek &s;upport in tho&s;e principles which fir&s;t taught us reciprocal e&s;teem, nor palliate our de&s;ertion of them by that &s;elf pity which would be|come our reproach. We have dared to make high claims, form high enter|pri&s;es, and a&s;&s;ert high truths; let us &s;hew our&s;elves worthy of the preten&s;ions we have made, and not by our proper weakne&s;s betray the cau&s;e of which we are enamoured.</P>
<P>You will not&mdash;no, you are too ju&s;t&mdash;I am &s;ure, madam, you will not attri|bute re&s;olutions like the&s;e, which are more (infinitely more) painful to the heart
<PB N="162" REF="163">
than they ought to be, to any light or unworthy change of &s;entiment. Supe|rior gifts, &s;uperior attainments, and &s;u|perior virtues inevitably beget admira|tion, in tho&s;e who di&s;cover them, for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Admiration is the parent of e&s;teem, and the continuance and increa&s;e of this e&s;teem is affection, or, in its pure&s;t and be&s;t &s;en&s;e, love. To &s;ay I would not e&s;teem and would not love virtue, and e&s;pecially high and unu&s;ual virtue, would be both folly and guilt.</P>
<P>But you have taught me how pure and &s;elf-denying this love may be. Oh that the man of your choice may but become all you hope, and all of which his uncommon powers are capable! Oh
<PB N="163" REF="164">
that I may but &s;ee you as happy as you de&s;erve to be, and I think I &s;hall then not be&s;tow much pity upon my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have forborne, madam, to intrude the petty di&s;quiets of another kind, from which as you will readily imagine I can|not have been wholly free. Need I &s;ay how much I di&s;approve my father's views, and the mode by which he would have them accompli&s;hed? There is no effort I will not make to conquer and remove this ob&s;tacle. It wounds me to the heart that you, the daughter of his benefactor, &s;hould for a moment be dependant on his avarice. The injury and iniquity are equally revolting, and there are moments when my prejudices fal&s;ely accu&s;e me of being a participator in the guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
I have had two conver&s;ations with my father: they both were animated; but, though he was very determined, his re|&s;olution begins to fail; and, as I have ju&s;tice on my &s;ide and am &s;till more de|termined than he, I have no doubt that in a few days every thing which Sir Arthur has required of him he will be willing to undertake.</P>
<P>However as in a certain &s;en&s;e all is doubtful which is yet to be done, per|haps &s;trict prudence would demand that Sir Arthur &s;hould not be led to hope till &s;ucce&s;s is a&s;certained; of which I will not delay a moment to &s;end you informa|tion.</P>

<P>THE moment, Fairfax, the trying, the great, the glorious moment ap|proaches. Every po&s;&s;ible contributing cau&s;e calls aloud for expedition, and re|probates delay. This gardening fellow is gone. For his ab&s;ence I thank him, but not for the re&s;olute &s;pirit with which
<PB N="166" REF="167">
he intends to attack his father and make him yield. He has a tongue that would &s;ilence the congregated clamours of the Sorbonne, and dumb-found Belial him|&s;elf in the hall of Pandemonium. 'Tis certain he has a tough mor&s;el to encoun|ter, and yet I fear he will &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>This would de&s;troy all&mdash;Marry her?&mdash;No!&mdash;By heaven, no! If the hopes of Abimelech be not &s;tubborn enough to per&s;evere, they mu&s;t and &s;hall be &s;trengthened. His refu&s;al is indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in every view, unle&s;s the view of marriage, which I once more tell you, Fairfax, I now dete&s;t. I &s;hould have no plea with her, were that of delay removed.</P>
<P>What is &s;till wor&s;e, this delay may be removed by another and more painful
<PB N="167" REF="168">
cau&s;e. My mother it appears declines rapidly: her death is even feared, and &s;hould it happen, I cannot pretend to in&s;i&s;t on the ob&s;tacles which her mater|nal cares and provi&s;ionary fears have rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>I can think of no certain expedient, for this Abimelech, but that of an ano|nymous letter. Neither the writing nor the &s;tyle mu&s;t appear to be mine; nor mu&s;t the hand that writes it under&s;tand its purport. Tyros and ignorant as my opponents are, in the tricks and intrigues of amorous &s;tratagem, &s;till they have too much under&s;tanding not to be redoubtable.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e old necromancers Subtlety and Fal&s;ehood mu&s;t forge the magic armour, and the enchanted &s;hield, under which I
<PB N="168" REF="169">
fight. Like wizards of yore, they mu&s;t render me invi&s;ible; and the fair form of the fooli&s;h Clifton they have imagined mu&s;t only be &s;een.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t Ab y, or I mi&s;take him, is too worthy a fellow to de&s;ert &s;o good a cau&s;e. And this cloud-capt lady, who&s;e proud turrets I have &s;worn to level with the du&s;t, will not de&s;cend to plead the ap|proaching death of my mother, when I &s;hall urge the inju&s;tice of delay&mdash;Ay, Fairfax, the inju&s;tice! I mean to com|mand, to dare, to overawe; that is the only oratory which can put her to the rout. She loves to be a&s;toni&s;hed, and a&s;toni&s;hed &s;he &s;hall be. If I do not &s;hrink from my&s;elf her fall is infallible.</P>
<P>My heart exults in the coming joy! Never more will the milky pulp of com|pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="169" REF="170">
ri&s;e to mar the luxurious meal! She has been writing to the fellow, Fairfax; ay and has &s;hewn me her letter! For, let her but imagine that truth, or virtue, or principle, or any other abortive being of her own creation, requires her to follow the whims of her disjointed fancy, and what frantic folly is there of which &s;he is incapable?</P>
<P>'Tis maddening to recollect, but &s;he doats on the fellow; ab&s;olutely doats! I am the tormenting demon that has ap|peared to interrupt her happine&s;s; &s;he the devoted victim, &s;acrificed to &s;hield me from harm! The thought of &s;e|paration from him is di&s;tracting, and every power mu&s;t be conjured up to avert the horrid woe!</P>
<P>Never before did my feelings &s;upport
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;uch various and continual attacks; ne|ver did I endure infidelity &s;o open or in&s;ult &s;o unblu&s;hing. But, patience; the day of vengeance is at hand, or rather is here! This moment will I fly and take it! Expect to hear <Q>of battles, &s;ieges, di&s;a&s;trous chances, and of moving accidents; but not of hair breadth '&s;capes!</Q>&mdash;E&s;cape &s;he cannot! I go!

<P>IT is now a week &s;ince I wrote to you, madam, at which time I took &s;ome plea&s;ure in acquainting you with my hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e hopes conti|nued to increa&s;e, and my father had al|mo&s;t promi&s;ed to agree to the ju&s;t pro|po&s;als I made, when two days ago he
<PB N="172" REF="173">
&s;uddenly and pertinaciou&s;ly changed his opinion.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to add that he now ap|pears to be much more determined than ever, and that I am wholly a&s;toni&s;hed at and wholly unable to account for this alteration of &s;entiment. I delayed &s;end|ing you the intelligence by ye&s;terday's po&s;t, hoping it was only a temporary re|turn of former projects, which I could again rea&s;on away. But I find him &s;o po&s;itive, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, and &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on, that I am per&s;uaded &s;ome &s;e|cret cau&s;e has ari&s;en of which I am igno|rant.

<P>WHEN la&s;t I wrote my re&s;olution was taken, and I determined on imme|diate attack. But I went in a &s;eeming unlucky moment; though I much mi&s;take if it were not the very rever&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed misfortune I had fore|&s;een fell upon me. The '&s;quire of
<PB N="176" REF="177">
preachers had fairly overcome his father's ob&s;tinacy, and induced him to give ground! In&s;tead of having received the news of his determined per&s;i&s;tency, I found her with a letter in her hand, in|forming her that he had begun to relent, and that his full acquie&s;cence was ex|pected.</P>
<P>To have commenced the battle at &s;o inau&s;picious a moment would have been little worthy of a great captain. My re|&s;olution was in&s;tantly formed.</P>
<P>After acting as much ec&s;ta&s;y as I could call up, I ha&s;tened home and wrote my projected letter to hone&s;t Aby. I threw my hints together in Italian, that they might not be under&s;tood by the agent whom I meant to employ. This was my groom, an Engli&s;h lad whom I met
<PB N="177" REF="178">
with at Paris, who &s;pells well and writes a good hand. I pretended I had cru&s;hed my finger and could not hold a pen; and, without letting him under|&s;tand the intent of my writing, or even that it was a letter, I dictated to him as follows; a tran&s;cript of which I &s;end to you, Fairfax, fir&s;t that you may &s;igh and &s;ee what the ble&s;&s;ing of a ready inven|tion is, and next as an example which you may copy, or at lea&s;t from which you may take a hint, if ever you &s;hould have occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>SO you have been per&s;uaded at la&s;t to give up your point, my old friend! And can you &s;wallow this tale of a tub? A fine cock and a bull &s;tory has been dinned in your
<PB N="178" REF="179">
ears? Don't believe a word on't. I know the whole affair; and, though you don't know me, be a&s;&s;ured I mean you well: and I tell you that if you will but hold out &s;toutly every thing will &s;oon be &s;ettled to your heart's de&s;ire. She is dying for love of him, and he can't &s;ee it! She will never have the man they mean for her; I can a&s;&s;ure you of that; and what is more he will never have her. What I tell you I know to be true. No matter who I am. If I knew nothing of the affair how could I write to you? And if the advice I give be good, what need you care whom it comes from? Only don't let your &s;on &s;ee this; if you do it will &s;poil all. You perceive how blind he is to his own
<PB N="179" REF="180">
good, and how po&s;itive too. Keep your coun&s;el, but be re&s;olute. Look around you, per&s;i&s;t in your own plans, and the hall, the parks, the gardens, the meadows, the lands you &s;ee are all your own! I am &s;ure you cannot mi&s;under&s;tand me. But mark my words; be clo&s;e; keep your thoughts to your&s;elf. You know the world: You have made your own fortune; don't mar it by your own folly. Tell no tales, I &s;ay; nor, if you are a wi&s;e man, give the lea&s;t hint that you have a friend in a corner.</Q></P>
<P>This I dictated to my amanuen&s;is, pretending to tran&s;late it out of the pa|per I held in my hand, and which I took care to place before him, &s;o that he
<PB N="180" REF="181">
&s;hould &s;ee it was really written in a fo|reign language. I likewi&s;e once or twice counterfeited a laugh at what I was reading, and ejaculated to my&s;elf&mdash;"This is a curious &s;crap!"</P>
<P>When he had fini&s;hed I gave him half a crown, prai&s;ed his hand-writing, which I told him I wanted to &s;ee, for perhaps I might find him better em|ployment than currying of hor&s;es, and &s;ent him about his bu&s;ine&s;s too much plea&s;ed and elated, and his ideas led into too di&s;tant a train to harbour the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Nor did my precautions end here. I immediately ordered my hor&s;e, and rode without any attendant full &s;peed to Houn&s;low. I there de&s;ired the land|lord of an inn at which I am per|&s;onally
<PB N="181" REF="182">
known, though not by name, to &s;end one of his own lads, po&s;t, to the market town next to Wenbourne-Hill, and there to hire a countryman, without explaining who or what he him&s;elf was, to deliver the letter into the hands of hone&s;t Aby. I reque&s;ted the landlord to choo&s;e an intelligent me&s;&s;enger, and backed my reque&s;t with a pre&s;ent bribe and a future pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>My plan was too well laid to mi&s;|carry, and accordingly ye&s;terday a mournful account arrived, from the young orator, that judgment is rever&s;ed, and he in imminent danger of being ca&s;t in co&s;ts.</P>
<P>And now, Fairfax, once more I go!&mdash;Expedition, re&s;olution, a torrent
<PB N="182" REF="183">

<P>ONCE more, Fairfax, here am I.</P>
<P>Well! And how&mdash;?</P>
<P>Not &s;o fa&s;t, good &s;ir. All things in their turn. The &s;tory &s;hall be told ju&s;t as it happened, and your galloping cu|rio&s;ity mu&s;t be plea&s;ed to wait.</P>
<P>I knew my time, the hour when &s;he
<PB N="184" REF="185">
would retire to her own apartment, and the minute when I might find admi&s;|&s;ion; for &s;he is very methodical, as all your very wi&s;e people more or le&s;s are. I had given Laura her le&s;&s;on; that is, had told her that I had &s;ome|thing very &s;erious to &s;ay to her mi&s;tre&s;s that morning, and de&s;ired her to take care to be out of the way, that &s;he might be &s;ure not to interrupt us. The &s;ly jade looked with that arch &s;ignificance which her own experience had taught her, and left me with&mdash;"Oh! Mr. Clifton!"</P>
<P>And here I could make a remark, but that would be anticipating my &s;tory.</P>
<P>You may think, Fairfax, that, mar|&s;halled as my hopes and fears were in
<PB N="185" REF="186">
battle array, &s;omething of inward agita|tion would be apparent. In reality not only &s;ome but much was vi&s;ible. It caught her attention, and luckily caught. I attempted to &s;peak, and &s;tammered. A fal&s;e &s;tep as it would have been mo&s;t fatal &s;o was it more probable at the mo|ment of on&s;et than afterward, when the heated imagination &s;hould have col|lected, arranged, and begun to pour forth its &s;tores.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophy of the pa&s;&s;ions was the theme I fir&s;t cho&s;e, though at the very moment when my &s;pirits were all fluttering with wild di&s;order. But my faultering voice, which had I wi&s;hed I could not have commanded, aided me; for the tremulous &s;tate of my frame threw hers into mo&s;t admirable confu&s;ion!</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
<Q>What was it that di&s;turbed me? What had I to communicate? She never &s;aw me thus before! It was quite alarming!</Q></P>
<P>Madam&mdash;[Ob&s;erve, Fairfax, I am now the &s;peaker: but I &s;hall remind you of &s;uch trifles no more.

I do you wrong. Your mind is &s;uperior to &s;u&s;picion. It is a mean an odious vice, and never could I e&s;teem the heart in which it found place. I forget my&s;elf, and talk to you as I would to a being of an infinitely lower order.</P>

<P>Do not let your eye reprove me! I have not &s;aid what is not; and who better knows than you how much it

<P>Do not keep me in this &s;u&s;pen&s;e! I am &s;ure there is &s;omething very un|common in your thoughts! Speak!</P>
<P>Thoughts will be &s;ometimes our ma&s;|ters: the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of us cannot always command them. That I have daily repre&s;&s;ed them, have &s;truggled again&s;t rooted prejudices and confirmed propen&s;ities, and have ardently endea|voured to ri&s;e to that proud eminence toward which you have continually pointed, you are my witne&s;s.</P>

<P>Oh, Clifton! Speak thus, be thus ever!</P>

<P>Clifton, you &s;aid you had a nobler motive.</P>
<P>I merit the reproach, madam. The&s;e effu&s;ions bur&s;t from me, are unworthy of me, and I di&s;claim them.

<P>If truth it be, &s;peak, and fear nothing. Propo&s;e but any adequate and worthy purpo&s;e, and there is no pain, no danger, no di&s;grace from which if I know my&s;elf I would &s;hrink.</P>
<P>No di&s;grace, madam?</P>
<P>Your words and looks both doubt me&mdash;Put me to the proof. Propo&s;e I &s;ay an adequate and worthy purpo&s;e, and let your te&s;t be &s;uch as nature &s;hudders at; then de&s;pi&s;e me and my principles if I recoil.</P>
<P>The union of marriage demands reci|procal,

<P>As I foreboded, it was all over for this time! She opened the letter. What its contents were I know not; and im|po&s;&s;ible as it is that they &s;hould relate to me, I yet wi&s;h I did.

<P>The grand difficulty however is van|qui&s;hed: &s;he will hear me the next time with le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e, and the emotions of pa&s;&s;ion, genuine hone&s;t mundane pa&s;|&s;ion, mu&s;t take their turn; for not even &s;he, Fairfax, can be wholly exempt from the&s;e emotions.

<HEAD>ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LOUISA!&mdash;My dear, my kind, my affectionate Loui&s;a!&mdash;My friend!&mdash;What &s;hall I &s;ay? How &s;hall I begin? I am going to rend your heart.&mdash;</P>
<P>Keep this letter from the &s;ight of Mrs. Clifton: if &s;he have not already been told, do not let her know &s;uch a letter
<PB N="208" REF="209">
exi&s;ts&mdash;Oh this brother!&mdash;But he is not your brother&mdash;Error &s;o rooted, &s;o ma|lignant, &s;o de&s;tructive exceeds all credi|bility!</P>
<P>He came to me ye&s;terday morning, as was his cu&s;tom. There was &s;omething in his look which, could I but have read it, was exceedingly de&s;criptive of the workings of his heart. It was painful to &s;ee him. He endeavoured to &s;mile and for a moment to talk triflingly, but could not. He was in a tremor; his mouth parched, his lips white.</P>
<P>His next e&s;&s;ay was to philo&s;ophi&s;e; but in this attempt too he was entirely at fault.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions are all &s;ympathetic, and none more &s;o than this of trepidation. I cannot recollect what the ideas were that pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily through my mind; but I
<PB N="209" REF="210">
know he excited much alarm, doubt, and I believe &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>But, though he had found all this dif|ficulty to begin, having begun he reco|vered him&s;elf very &s;urpri&s;ingly. His colour returned, his voice became firm, his ideas clear, his rea&s;oning energetic, and his manner commanding. He &s;eem|ed to mould my hopes and apprehen&s;ions as he plea&s;ed, to in&s;pire terror this mo|ment, and the exce&s;s of confidence the next.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, my heart bleeds to &s;ay it, but his purpo&s;es were vile, his hypocri&s;y odi|ous, and&mdash;I mu&s;t forbear, and &s;peak of foul deeds in fair terms. I know not how many prejudices ri&s;e up to warn me; one that I am a woman, or rather a girl; another that I am writing to the man's
<PB N="210" REF="211">
&s;i&s;ter; a third that &s;he is my friend, and &s;o on with endle&s;s et ceteras. No mat|ter that truth is to this friend infinitely more precious than a brother. I may be allowed to feel indignation, but not to expre&s;s my feeling.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, the mo&s;t re|volting part of all is, that he harangued like the apo&s;tle of truth, the name of which he vilely prophaned, in favour of the be&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t pitiful, mo&s;t contempti|ble of vices; the mere vain-glory of &s;e|duction. He has not even &s;o much as the gratification of &s;en&s;ual appetite to plead in his excu&s;e. I am wrong; it was not vain glory. Vanity it&s;elf, con|temptible as &s;uch a &s;timulus would have been, was &s;carcely a &s;econdary motive. It was &s;omething wor&s;e; it was revenge.
<PB N="211" REF="212">
My mind has been wholly occupied in retracing his pa&s;t behaviour; I can think on no other &s;ubject, and every trait which recollection adds is a confirmation of this painful idea. He does not wi&s;h to marry me, and I almo&s;t doubt whe|ther he ever did, at lea&s;t fully and unre|&s;ervedly.</P>
<P>He came to me, Loui&s;a, and began with painting the torments of delay and the pangs of jealou&s;y, which he endea|voured to excu&s;e; and concluded with a bold appeal to my ju&s;tice; a daring, over-awing, confounding appeal. He called upon me at my peril, and as I re|&s;pected truth and virtue, to deny his claim.</P>
<P>And what was this claim?&mdash;I was his wife!&mdash;In every pure and virtu|ous
<PB N="212" REF="213">
&s;en&s;e his wife; and he demanded the privilege of a hu&s;band!&mdash;Demand|ed, Loui&s;a!&mdash;Demanded!&mdash;And de|manded it in &s;uch a tone, with &s;uch rapid, overbearing, bold expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch an apparent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of right, that for a moment my mind was utterly con|fu&s;ed!</P>
<P>Not that it ceded; no, not an in&s;tant. I knew there was an an&s;wer, a ju&s;t and irrefragable one, but I could not imme|diately find it. He perceived my di&s;or|der, and you cannot imagine what a &s;hamele&s;s and offen&s;ive form his fea|tures a&s;&s;umed! I know not what he would not in&s;tantly have attempted, had not, while I was endeavouring to awake from my lethargy, Mrs. Clarke come in! She brought me a letter&mdash;It was &s;ent ex|pre&s;s!
<PB N="213" REF="214">
&mdash;The hand writing was Frank's! Agitated as I was, &s;u&s;picion influenced me, and I retreated a few &s;teps&mdash;I open|ed the letter, and the fir&s;t words I &s;aw were&mdash;"Beware of Mr. Clifton."&mdash;</P>
<P>It contained only half a dozen lines, and I read on. What follows were its contents&mdash;</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="214" REF="215">
Think, Loui&s;a, what mu&s;t be the ef|fect of &s;uch a letter, coming at &s;uch a moment!&mdash;I believe I was in no dan|ger; though, if there be a man on the face of the earth more dangerous than any other, it is &s;urely Clifton. But the watchful &s;pirit of Frank &s;eems placed like my guardian angel, to protect me from all po&s;&s;ible harm.</P>
<P>My mind debated for a moment whe|ther it were not wrong to di&s;tru&s;t the power of truth and virtue, and not to let Mr. Clifton &s;ee I could demoli&s;h the au|dacious &s;ophi&s;try by which he had endea|voured to confound and overwhelm me. But my ideas were deranged, and I could not collect &s;ufficient fortitude. Oh how dangerous is this confu&s;ion of the judg|ment, and how de&s;irable that heavenly
<PB N="215" REF="216">
pre&s;ence of mind which is equal to the&s;e great the&s;e trying occa&s;ions! I therefore thought it more prudent to &s;uffer him to depart, and &s;u&s;pect vilely of me, than to encounter the rude conte&s;t which he would more audaciou&s;ly recommence, were I to &s;end away Mrs. Clarke, which he might even mi&s;con&s;true into a &s;ignal of approbation. The&s;e fears prevail|ed, and I de&s;ired her to &s;tay, and by my manner told him I wi&s;hed his ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, how &s;hall I de&s;cribe my an|gui&s;h of heart at &s;eeing all tho&s;e hopes of a mind &s;o extraordinary, for extraor|dinary it is even in guilt, at once over|thrown? It was indeed iteration of an|gui&s;h! What! Can guile &s;o perfectly a&s;&s;ume the garb of &s;incerity? Can hypo|pri&s;y

How be certain that the next &s;eeming virtuous man we meet is not a&mdash;Well, well, Loui&s;a&mdash;I will re|member&mdash;Brother. My Loui&s;a knows it is not from the per&s;on, but from the vice that I turn away with di&s;gu&s;t. Would I willingly give her heart a pang? Let her tell me if &s;he can &s;u&s;pect it. She has fortitude, &s;he has affection; but it is an affection for virtue, truth, and ju&s;tice. She will endeavour to re|form error the mo&s;t obdurate. So will I, &s;o will all that are worthy the high of|fice. But &s;he will not wi&s;h me either to marry with or to countenance this error. Marry?&mdash;How does my &s;oul &s;hudder at the thought! His rea&s;oning was ju&s;t;
<PB N="217" REF="218">
&s;eduction would have been a petty in|jury, or rather a ble&s;&s;ing, compared to this ma&s;ter evil! He was mo&s;t merci|ful when he meant me, as he thought, mo&s;t de&s;truction. I have been guilty of a great error. The reformation of man or woman by projects of marriage is a mi&s;taken a pernicious attempt. In|&s;tead of being an act of morality, I am per&s;uaded it is an act of vice. Let us never cea&s;e our endeavours to reform the licentious and the depraved, but let us not marry them.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>The letter had not been delivered more than two hours before Frank ar|rived.
<PB N="218" REF="219">
You may think, Loui&s;a, how hard he had ridden; but he refu&s;ed to imagine him&s;elf fatigued. He brought another letter, which Abimelech had received, but which for &s;ome hours he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to give up, and for this rea&s;on Frank fent off the expre&s;s. A letter, not of Clif|ton's writing, but of his invention and &s;ending!</P>
<P>Finding that Frank was likely to prevail on his father to rai&s;e the money for Sir Arthur, and obviate all further impediments to our marriage, Clifton, fearful that it &s;hould take place, wrote anonymou&s;ly to Abimelech, to inform him I was in love with Frank, and to encourage him to per&s;i&s;t. But read
<PB N="219" REF="220">
the letter your&s;elf; the following is a true copy of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader has already peru&s;ed it in Letter XCIV, to which he is referred.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>If &s;uch a letter be his, I am &s;ure, Loui&s;a, you will not &s;ay I have thought or &s;poken too unkindly of him; and that it is his we have indubitable proof, though it was anonymous and not in his hand-writing.</P>
<P>You no doubt remember, Loui&s;a, the &s;hort &s;tory of the Engli&s;h lad, whom your brother hired at Paris. It was written by him, though innocently and without knowing what was intended. This lad has an aunt, who after having
<PB N="220" REF="221">
laboured to old age is now lame, in|firm, and in need of &s;upport. The ac|tive Frank has been with her, has aided her with money and con&s;oled her with kindne&s;s. The lad him&s;elf was de&s;irous of a&s;&s;i&s;ting her; and Frank, willing to encourage indu&s;try in the young, gave him &s;ome writings to copy at his lei&s;ure hours. By this accident he knew the lad's hand-writing.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention, in its proper place, the a&s;toni&s;hment of Frank at the &s;udden change in his father, and the firm re&s;olution he took to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of this change. The ob&s;tinacy of Abimelech was extreme; but Frank was &s;till more pertinacious, more deter|mined, and &s;o unwearied and ince&s;&s;ant,
<PB N="221" REF="222">
in his attacks on his father, that the old man at la&s;t could re&s;i&s;t no longer, and &s;hewed him this letter.</P>
<P>From what has preceded, that is from his manner of acting, you may well ima|gine what the alarms and &s;en&s;ations of Frank were. He brought the letter up with him, for he would not tru&s;t it out of his own cu&s;tody, and imme|diately went him&s;elf to Clifton's &s;tables in &s;earch of the lad, brought him to me, and then fir&s;t &s;hewed him the letter, which that no po&s;&s;ible collu&s;ion might be alleged he had left in my keeping, and then a&s;ked if it were not his hand|writing. The lad very frankly and unhe&s;itatingly an&s;wered it was; except the direction, which this plotting Clif|ton
<PB N="222" REF="223">
had procured to be written by &s;ome other per&s;on.</P>
<P>Without telling the lad more than was nece&s;&s;ary, Frank advi&s;ed him to quit his &s;ervice, for that there was &s;omething relating to that letter which would certainly occa&s;ion a quarrel, and perhaps wor&s;e, between him and his ma&s;ter: and, as it would be prudent for him to keep out of the way, he &s;ent him down to Wenbourne-Hill, where the lad is at pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>LOUISA CLIFTON TO HER BROTHER COKE CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Ro&s;e-Bank.</HI></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Friday morning I received the original letter from Anna St. Ives, of which the inclo&s;ed is a copy; and on the following day about a quarter of an hour before midnight my mother ex|pired. I mention the&s;e circum&s;tances
<PB N="226" REF="227">
together becau&s;e they were noticed, by tho&s;e who were nece&s;&s;arily acquainted with them, as having a relation to each other; whether real or imaginary, much or little I do not pretend to determine; but I will relate the facts and leave them to your own reflection; and I will forbear all colouring, that I may not be &s;u&s;pected of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>My mother as you know has been daily declining, and was indeed in a very feeble &s;tate. She &s;eemed rather more cheerful that morning than &s;he had been lately, and at her particular reque&s;t I went to vi&s;it the wife of farmer Beardmore, who is a worthy but poor woman, and who being at pre&s;ent de|jected, in con&s;equence of poverty and ill health, my mother thought &s;he might
<PB N="227" REF="228">
be more benefited by the kindne&s;s of the little relief we could afford her if delivered by me, than if &s;ent by a le&s;s &s;oothing and &s;ympathetic hand. I &s;hould hope, &s;ir, it would be &s;ome con&s;olation to you to learn that my mo|ther's active virtue never for&s;ook her, while memory and mind remained. But of this you are the be&s;t judge.</P>
<P>While I was gone the po&s;tman brought the letter of my friend; and as her letters were always read to my mother, and as I likewi&s;e have made it a rule and a duty not to have any &s;ecrets to conceal from her, or indeed from any body, &s;he had no &s;cruple to have the letter opened, becau&s;e &s;he expected to find con&s;olation and hope: for, till the arrival of this, the letters of Anna St.
<PB N="228" REF="229">
Ives have lately been all zealous in your prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I will leave you, &s;ir, to imagine the effect which a letter beginning as this did mu&s;t have on a mind and body worn to &s;uch a tremulous &s;tate of &s;en&s;i|bility. Coming as it did fir&s;t into my mother's hands, the very caution which the benevolent heart of Anna dictated produced the effect &s;he mo&s;t dreaded. My mother had &s;till however a &s;ufficient portion of her former energy to hear it to the end.</P>
<P>In about an hour after this happened I returned, and found her in extreme agitation of mind. I neglected no ar|guments, no efforts to calm her &s;en&s;a|tions; and I &s;ucceeded &s;o far that after a time &s;he &s;eemed to be tolerably re&s;igned.
<PB N="229" REF="230">
She could not indeed forget it, and the &s;ubject was revived by her &s;everal times during the day.</P>
<P>My chief endeavour was to lead her thoughts into that train which, by look|ing forward to the progre&s;s of virtue, is mo&s;t con&s;oling to the mind of vir|tue.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed at la&s;t fatigued, and about eleven o'clock at night fell into a doze. About a quarter before twelve I per|ceived her countenance di&s;torted; I was alarmed; I &s;poke to her and received no an&s;wer; I endeavoured to excite at|tention or motion, but in vain. A pa|ralytic &s;troke had deprived her of &s;en&s;a|tion. In this &s;tate &s;he remained four-and-twenty hours, and about midnight departed.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231">
I have thought it &s;trictly incumbent on me to relate the&s;e circum&s;tances. But I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf as very highly culpable did I &s;eek to aggravate, or to &s;tate that as certainty which can never be any thing more than conjec|ture. My mother was &s;o enfeebled that we began to be in daily apprehen&s;ion of her death. I mu&s;t not however con|ceal that the thought of your union with Anna St. Ives had been one of her prin|cipal plea&s;ures, ever &s;ince &s;he had &s;up|po&s;ed it probable; and that &s;he had &s;poken of it ince&s;&s;antly, and always with that high degree of maternal affection and cheering hope which you cannot but know was congenial to her na|ture.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointment it&s;elf was great,
<PB N="231" REF="232">
but the turpitude that attended it much greater. This I did not endeavour to palliate. How could I? I have told you I had no re&s;ource for con&s;olation, either for my&s;elf or her, but in turning, like Anna St. Ives, from the individual to the whole.</P>
<P>I would endeavour to &s;ay &s;omething that &s;hould &s;hew you the folly of &s;uch conduct; for the folly of it is even more exce&s;&s;ive than the vice; but, not to mention the &s;tate of my own mind at this moment, I de&s;pair of producing any effect, &s;ince Anna St. Ives her&s;elf, aided by &s;o many concurring motives, has failed in the generous and di&s;inter|e&s;ted attempt.</P>
<P>I imagine you will be down at the funeral. Perhaps it is proper. I can|not
<PB N="232" REF="233">
&s;ay, for indeed I do not very well under&s;tand many of what are called the proprieties of cu&s;tom. I own I am weak enough to feel &s;ome pain at meeting you, under the pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances. But, &s;ince it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould act and aid you in various family departments, if you &s;hould come down, I will not yield to the&s;e emo|tions, but con&s;idering you as an er|ring brother, will endeavour to per|form what duty requires.</P>

difficult to calm. I de&s;troyed them, not becau&s;e they were wrong, but le&s;t they &s;hould produce a wrong ef|fect.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London, Dover Street.</HI></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your very lenient, equitable, calumniating, in&s;ulting let|ter; and I would have you put it down in your memorandum-book that I will carefully remember the obligation. It perfectly accords with your &s;ublime
<PB N="235" REF="236">
ideas of ju&s;tice to decide before you have heard both parties; and it is equally con&s;i&s;tent with your notions of &s;i&s;terly affection that you &s;hould pa&s;s &s;entence on a brother. What is a brother, or all he may have to &s;ay, to you; who, more infallible than the holy father him&s;elf, have &s;quared a &s;et of rules of your own, by which you judge as you be&s;t know how?</P>
<P>Your in&s;inuations concerning the death of my mother are equally chari|table, and I have already learnt them by rote. Yes, madam, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf they will not be forgotten. Any &s;u&s;pen&s;e of judgment would have ill become a lady &s;o clear &s;ighted. However po&s;&s;ible it may be that Anna St. Ives may her&s;elf have been impo&s;ed upon, and I both
<PB N="236" REF="237">
ignorant and innocent of this forged letter, yet for you to have entertained any doubts in my favour would have partaken too much of the fogs of earth for &s;o in&s;pired and cele&s;tial a lady.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t tell you, madam, &s;ince you can &s;o readily forego equity in a brother's behalf, I can and will be as ready to forget and ca&s;t off the &s;i&s;ter. I never yet was or will be injured with impunity: I would have you note down that.</P>
<P>I mean to be at Ro&s;e-Bank tomorrow or the day after, to attend the funeral and take &s;uch order as my affairs may require; and though I have as little af|fection for your company as you have for mine, I imagine it will be quite ne|ce&s;&s;ary for you to be there: not only
<PB N="237" REF="238">
that you &s;hould be pre&s;ent to execute all orders, but likewi&s;e to li&s;ten to a few hints which I &s;hall probably think pro|per to communicate.</P>
<P>In the mean time, madam, be indu&s;|trious to propagate the report, if you think fit, that I have cau&s;ed anonymous letters to be written to Sir Arthur's &s;teward, have endeavoured to betray Anna St. Ives, and have been the death of my mother. Spread the agreeable intelligence I &s;ay as quickly and as widely as you can, and when you meet me you &s;hall receive a brother's thanks.</P>
