<HEAD>CHAP. I. On Saint Gregory of Ny&s;&s;a, and his Panegyric on Virginity.</HEAD>
<P>I RETURN from the cha&s;te and pious poets to the pro&s;aic encomia&s;ts of virginity. On examining the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical writers who have merited this title, I find they are &s;uch a ho&s;t, that I fear the attention of my reader would de&s;ert me, if I attempted to enumerate and de|&s;cribe
<PB N="2" REF="4">
them. I &s;hall now, therefore, con|fine my&s;elf to four &s;ucceeding fathers of the church, who are entitled to our regard by the highe&s;t reputation for &s;anctity and eloquence; and from the&s;e I &s;hall only &s;e|lect, as briefly as I can, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as &s;eem to throw a particular light on the &s;i&s;ter|hood, and are at the &s;ame time remarkable for &s;trength and originality either of thought or expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the four is St. Gregory of Ny&s;&s;a, a younger brother of the great St. Ba&s;il, and a friend and corre&s;pondent of the poetical St. Gregory, who formed the prin|cipal &s;ubject of our la&s;t chapter. The St. Gregory of whom I am now to &s;peak, was ordained bi&s;hop of Ny&s;&s;a, in Cappadocia, by his brother St. Ba&s;il, in 372; in 385 he preached the funeral &s;ermon of the empre&s;s Placilla; and by a late writer he is &s;aid to have died in 396, with the venerable title of Father of he Fathers.</P>
<P>The panegyric which this &s;aint compo&s;ed on virginity is the more remarkable, as we
<PB N="3" REF="5">
have po&s;itive evidence that he was him&s;elf a married man. This circum&s;tance, however, is very far from having rendered him a lan|guid advocate for the excellence of a &s;ingle life; on the contrary, he begins his enco|mium by declaring,
<Q>that whoever ambi|tiou&s;ly hopes to be&s;tow &s;uch prai&s;e on vir|ginity as is adequate to its merit, re&s;em|bles a per&s;on who fooli&s;hly &s;uppo&s;es that he may encrea&s;e the magnitude of the ocean by a drop of his own &s;weat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.

<P>The &s;i&s;terhood will, I hope, excu&s;e in their holy advocate the indelicacy of this expre&s;&s;ion, for the flattering energy of the &s;entiment.&mdash;But to proceed with St. Gre|gory.</P>
<P>Having a&s;&s;erted the dignity of this cele&s;|tial excellence, he laments his own grovel|ling condition, in being precluded by mar|riage from a &s;hare of this glory.
<Q>A know|ledge
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of the charms that belong to celi|bacy, is to me,</Q>
&s;ays St. Gregory,
<Q>what food is to the ox, when, turned to a full rack, he is prevented from reaching it by his harne&s;s.</Q>
&mdash;Having forcibly de&s;cri|bed his own mortifications by this &s;triking image, he enlarges on the various evils that ari&s;e trom matrimony, which he con&s;iders as a great &s;ource, not only of unhappine&s;s, but of guilt.&mdash;"Look," &s;ays he,
<Q>at the pa&s;|&s;ing &s;cene&mdash;marriage is the general pro|logue to all the tragedies of life.</Q>
&mdash;After painting the conjugal &s;tate in the mo&s;t gloomy colours, he delineates, with a bril|liant pencil, the pure delights of virginity, which he repre&s;ents as a certain art and power of eluding all the vexations of earth, and attaining, even on this &s;ide the grave, the beatitude of heaven.</P>
<P>Having declaimed again&s;t wedlock with much freedom, or rather contempt and &s;corn, the &s;aint &s;eems to apprehend that his zeal for cha&s;tity has carried him too far, and
<PB N="5" REF="7">
he makes the following remarkable apo|logy.</P>
<P>"Let no one," &s;ays he,
<Q>imagine that I intend to cen&s;ure the e&s;tabli&s;hment of marriage; for I am aware that it has not wanted the approbation of God: but, &s;ince nature &s;ufficiently in&s;tigates mankind to people the world by this connection, it would be &s;uperfluous labour to compo&s;e an encomium on marriage, which finds, in the alluring voice of plea&s;ure, an eter|nal advocate and patron; while virginity is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the antagoni&s;t of na|ture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.
<BIBL>S. Greg. Ny&s;&s;. p. 568.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. My &s;entiments on matrimony,</Q>
continues the &s;aint,
<Q>are the&s;e:&mdash;we ought to prefer to it the care of our cele&s;tial in|tere&s;t, and yet not to de&s;pi&s;e the per&s;on who makes a wi&s;e and temperate u&s;e of this in&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P>Though the &s;aint, in the preceding &s;en|tence, has con&s;ulted his own per&s;onal credit
<PB N="6" REF="8">
as a married man, he very candidly proceeds to declare, that
<Q>although marriage may be regarded as a kind of &s;afe port again&s;t the tempe&s;ts of licentious pa&s;&s;ion, yet vir|ginity affords a &s;ecurer refuge, and a more tranquil harbour.</Q></P>
<P>He contends, that man, as originally created, was perfectly free from all animal de&s;ires; and, in&s;tead of receiving plea&s;ure from the gratification of &s;en&s;ual appetite, delighted only in the contemplation of his Maker. He alledges, it is evident from &s;cripture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gene&s;is chap. iv.</NOTE>, that Adam had no connubial in|tercour&s;e with Eve till after their expul&s;ion from Paradi&s;e, when woman was con|demned to the pains of child-birth, as a pu|ni&s;hment for di&s;obedience. "Therefore," continues the &s;aint,
<Q>as we lo&s;t Paradi&s;e by the &s;en&s;ual offence of our fir&s;t parents, it is in our own power to regain it by a vo|luntary &s;acrifice of all, &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures. As the per&s;ons who have wandered from
<PB N="7" REF="9">
their own country, and wi&s;h to return to it, begin by quitting the place to which they have &s;trayed; in the &s;ame manner, &s;ince marriage was the la&s;t &s;tep which completed our &s;eparation from Paradi&s;e, I would advi&s;e tho&s;e who are ambitious of returning thither, to begin by relinqui&s;h|ing marriage, the <HI>la&s;t &s;tage</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>, <HI>as it were,</HI> in the road between earth and heaven.</Q></P>
<P>St. Gregory proceeds to prove the do|minion of virginity over death, which he accompli&s;hes by a &s;ingular mode of rea&s;on|ing:&mdash;"The production of children," &s;ays he,
<Q>does not mini&s;ter &s;o much to life as to death, &s;ince their birth only leads to their di&s;&s;olution; but they who devote their per&s;ons to virginity, place them&s;elves as a kind of i&s;thmus between life and death, to &s;top the fury of the latter. The deva&s;ta|tion of death is thus prevented; for, as the power of fire cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without fuel, &s;o the force of death cannot prevail, unle&s;s marriage &s;upplies him with his prey.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">The &s;aint now enters on a more minute de&s;cription of virginity; which does not, he &s;ays, con&s;i&s;t merely in per&s;onal purity, but in di&s;charging all the duties of a tranquil and &s;potle&s;s mind. He borrows, on this occa|&s;ion, from his brother St. Ba&s;il the remark|able &s;imile, which I have already mentioned, of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive circles produced in water by the impul&s;e of a &s;ingle &s;tone; an image which he u&s;es to illu&s;trate the agitation pro|duced in a peaceful mind by the admi&s;&s;ion of any one inordinate de&s;ire.&mdash;
<Q>Let virgi|nity,</Q>
&s;ays the &s;aint,
<Q>be the foundation on which the works of virtue are rai&s;ed; for, excellent and honourable as it is, if this purity of per&s;on is not united to inte|grity of mind&mdash;if the whole life of a virgin does not corre&s;pond to this profe&s;&s;ed ex|cellence&mdash;if &s;he is blackened by inconti|nence of &s;pirit&mdash;her virginity is but an ear|ring in the no&s;e of a &s;ow, or a pearl trod|den under the feet of &s;wine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.
<BIBL>Sanct. Greg. Ny&s;&s;. p. 593.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">I mu&s;t not omit the whim&s;ical conceit with which St. Gregory a&s;&s;erts the honour of Miriam, the &s;i&s;ter of Aaron, as the pri|mitive model of true virginity. Having de|&s;cribed her dancing with a timbrel in her hand, after the miraculous pa&s;&s;age through the Red Sea, he imagines that this mu&s;ical in&s;trument is mentioned in &s;cripture as a &s;ymbol of her cha&s;tity, on account of the &s;imilarity, which he di&s;covers between vir|ginity and the timbrel&mdash;a wonderful &s;imi|larity! which Gregory has explained in language that I forbear to copy, le&s;t the cha&s;te eyes of the modern &s;i&s;terhood &s;hould be &s;hocked by the expre&s;&s;ive images of this fanciful &s;aint.</P>
<P>In a former part of my work I had occa|&s;ion to remark, that Miriam was not entitled to this di&s;tinction, as &s;he, in all probability, was a married woman. The genius and ta|lents of this fair Hebrew &s;eem, indeed, to have operated like tho&s;e of a modern fine lady, who, eclip&s;ing her hu&s;band by the brilliancy
<PB N="10" REF="12">
of her &s;pirit, reduces him to &s;uch in&s;ignifi|cance, that he is rarely mentioned.</P>
<P>But to conclude this brief account of St. Gregory. In the &s;ub&s;equent part of his di&s;|cour&s;e, he endeavours to &s;ettle the ju&s;t me|dium between luxury and extreme ab&s;ti|nence, as he is far from being a friend to that rigorous di&s;cipline by which the health of many a mona&s;tic reclu&s;e has been de&s;troyed. The twenty-fourth and la&s;t chapter of his treati&s;e is very remarkable; for, in&s;tead of declaiming, like mo&s;t of the fathers, again&s;t the depravity of the times, he &s;peaks of his own age as abounding in good examples.&mdash; "Sanctity," &s;ays he,
<Q>is now, if ever, in &s;o flouri&s;hing a &s;tate, that it wants but little to reach the &s;ummit of perfection.</Q>
&mdash;He concludes, by recommending it to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to lead a virgin life, to put them|&s;elves under the guidance of an experienced and venerable conductor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. On St. Ambro&s;e, and his &s;everal Compo&s;itions in Prai&s;e of Virginity.</HEAD>
<P>THE Latin fathers of the church were by no means inferior to the Greek, in the zealous veneration which they paid to virginity. The cha&s;te devotees of Italy found an ardent, indefatigable advocate and patron in the celebrated St. Ambro&s;e, who was unexpectedly rai&s;ed, by the voice of the people, from a civil &s;tation to the rank of an archbi&s;hop; and, having filled the epi&s;|copal throne of Milan about twenty years, ended his active and glorious life in that city at the age of 57, in the year 394.</P>
<P>This eminent writer devoted &s;everal di&s;|tinct performances to the con&s;ecrated vir|gins. There are three of his productions that particularly claim our attention, and of the&s;e I &s;hall &s;peak as they occur.&mdash;The fir&s;t,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and mo&s;t elaborate, is a Treati&s;e on Virgins, divided into three books, and addre&s;&s;ed to his &s;i&s;ter Marcellina; who, hearing that he had preached with &s;ingular eloquence on this intere&s;ting topic, and being unable to attend his public di&s;cour&s;es, reque&s;ted from her brother the particulars of his doc|trine.</P>
<P>Saint Ambro&s;e begins his treati&s;e with &s;ingular humility, in comparing him&s;elf to the &s;peaking a&s;s of Balaam. He then takes occa&s;ion, from the fe&s;tival of St. Agnes, to celebrate the excellence of that virgin mar|tyr, a Roman dam&s;el, di&s;tingui&s;hed by her rank and beauty, who, with miraculous for|titude, at the age of thirteen, preferred the tortures of per&s;ecution to the rich offers of a Pagan lover, and peri&s;hed by the &s;word in the beginning of the fourth century. It may be worth remarking, that the merits of this infant martyr have given ri&s;e to many the mo&s;t &s;pirited of pious panegyrics; and that her name has been extolled by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops, &s;aints, and poets, from
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the vehement Ambro&s;e to the tender and elegant Ma&s;&s;llon, bi&s;hop of Clermont, who&s;e works contain a mo&s;t beautiful and pathetic &s;ermon on the fe&s;tival of this lovely martyr.</P>
<P>From the prai&s;e of Agnes, St. Ambro&s;e proceeds to a general encomium on cha&s;|tity, which was unknown, he &s;ays, or imper|fectly pre&s;erved, through all the nations of the heathen world.&mdash;"But how," &s;ays the &s;aint, very candidly,
<Q>can the human un|der&s;tanding comprehend what nature has not included in her laws <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Quis autem humano eam po&s;&s;it ingenio compre|hendere, quam nec natura &s;uis inclu&s;it legibus?
<BIBL>Divi Ambro&s;ii de Virginibus, Lib. 1.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>?</Q>
&mdash;He then endeavours to prove, that celibacy is an in|&s;titution of God, and heaven the true coun|try of virgins. He expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts that the pre&s;ervation of cha&s;tity makes an an|gel, and the lo&s;s of it a devil <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Qui eam &s;ervavit angelus e&s;t, qui perdidit, dia|bolus.</NOTE>. He com|pares the condition of the wife, condemned
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to the pains of child-birth, with the happy freedom of the con&s;ecrated maiden. He makes a very &s;ubtle and powerful addre&s;s to parents, per&s;uading them to atone for their own offences, by the early con&s;ecration of their virgin daughters; an exhortation which mu&s;t have contributed very cruelly to in|crea&s;e the number of wretched and invo|luntary Old Maids, as many &s;uper&s;titious and &s;elfi&s;h parents were undoubtedly ready to make their own peace with Heaven, at the expence of their unfortunate off|&s;pring.</P>
<P>Saint Ambro&s;e mentions, with exultation, the &s;warms of pious dam&s;els that ha&s;tened to receive the veil from his hand, not only from the neighbouring cities of Italy, but from the di&s;tant regions of Mauritania. He exhorts the young virgins to di&s;regard all dome&s;tic impediments to their religious de|&s;ires, and to embrace a mona&s;tic life in ex|pre&s;s oppo&s;ition to the authority of their pa|rents. He endeavours to ju&s;tify this bold advice by a remarkable anecdote, which
<PB N="15" REF="17">
concludes the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of his treati&s;e, and which I &s;hall copy, to render my fair readers acquainted with the &s;ingular &s;tyle of this &s;aint.&mdash;
<Q>If you believe not the words of Heaven,</Q>
cries Ambro&s;e,
<Q>yet be|lieve examples. In our memory, a dam|&s;el, once noble by her worldly rank, and now more ennobled by her attachment to God, being urged to marriage by her parents and relations, fled for refuge to the altar; and where can a virgin &s;eek a better a&s;ylum, than that holy &s;pot where the &s;acrifice of virginity is pre&s;ented? But even here &s;he was troubled with im|pious importunity. She &s;tood by the altar of God as the offering of mode&s;ty, as the victim of continence. 'Why are you &s;o anxious for my nuptials?' &s;he exclaim|ed to her relations&mdash;'I am betrothed al|ready. You offer me a hu&s;band, but I have found a better. Exaggerate the riches, boa&s;t the nobility, proclaim the power, of the party you propo&s;e; I have
<PB N="16" REF="18">
cho&s;en <HI>Him</HI> to whom no one can be com|pared; rich in the world, powerful in dominion, pre-eminent in heaven. If you have &s;uch to offer, I do not refu&s;e the option; but if you find not &s;uch, your conduct towards me is rather envious than provident.'&mdash;One of her relations, ob&s;erving the re&s;t were &s;ilenced, abruptly &s;aid, 'What if your father were living, would he &s;uffer you to remain unmar|ried?'&mdash;The virgin an&s;wered, with new religious fervour, and more temperate piety, 'On this account, perhaps, he died, that he might not prove an impe|diment to the &s;anctity of his daughter.'&mdash; This reply concerning her father proved a kind of prophecy to her relation, as he al&s;o expired &s;oon after it, and the vir|gin &s;ucceeded in her holy purpo&s;e. Ob|&s;erve, ye maidens, this reward of devo|tion! Beware, ye parents, of a &s;imilar of|fence!</Q></P>
<P>Saint Ambro&s;e, having thus magnified the excellence of virginity in the fir&s;t divi|&s;ion
<PB N="17" REF="19">
of his di&s;cour&s;e, propo&s;es, in the &s;econd, to in&s;truct the young virgin in the particu|lars of her duty; and, to guard him&s;elf from the imputation of arrogance, he offers to his fair di&s;ciples, not a collection of &s;evere pre|cepts, but of &s;plendid examples. Having exhorted them to imitate the humility of the Virgin Mary, and the fortitude of the mar|tyr Thecla, he relates a recent in&s;tance of female cha&s;tity and re&s;olution in the in|tere&s;ting adventures that befel a young and beautiful virgin of Antioch, who, on her re|fu&s;al to wor&s;hip the Pagan Divinities, was dragged into a public brothel, where her cha&s;tity was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger, but was happily pre&s;erved by the fervour of her eloquence, and the &s;incerity of her virtue. She made a convert and a friend of the heathen &s;oldier who had taken an active part in the outrage &s;he endured, and in&s;pired her per&s;ecutor with &s;uch pity and e&s;teem, that he attempted, at the hazard of his own life, to pre&s;erve the purity which he had de&s;igned to violate. By an exchange
<PB N="18" REF="20">
of dre&s;s, he contrived the e&s;cape of the vir|gin, but was him&s;elf condemned to die for the pious deception. The heroic virgin bravely ru&s;hed from her concealment to in|tercept the fate of her generous deliverer. They mutually contended for the glory of dying for each other. Their religious he|roi&s;m was derided by the barbarity of per&s;e|cution, and the only indulgence they ob|tained, was that of peri&s;hing together.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that this pathetic little &s;tory has employed the pen of a famous French poet, and of an Engli&s;h philo&s;opher of equal eminence. The <HI>Theodore</HI> of Cor|neille, as he informs us him&s;elf, was found|ed on this anecdote related by St. Ambro&s;e; and, among the juvenile works of our great Boyle, we find the martyrdom of Theodora and Didymus. But the tragedy of the &s;u|blime poet, and the narrative of the benevo|lent philo&s;opher, are both &s;unk into &s;imi|lar neglect; a circum&s;tance &s;ufficiently ac|counted for by a lively remark of Voltaire, who ob&s;erves, very ju&s;tly, on this play of
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Corneille, that
<Q>he cho&s;e the &s;ubject be|cau&s;e he had more genius than ta&s;te;</Q>
an ob&s;ervation, perhaps, as applicable to the Engli&s;h philo&s;opher as to the French poet; and certainly &s;till more applicable to the Latin &s;aint; for Ambro&s;e has related the&s;e adventures in a quaint and conceited &s;tyle, full of indecency and affectation. I have therefore declined a tran&s;lation of the pa&s;|&s;age, from the per&s;ua&s;ion that my readers would be more entertained by a &s;horter and more &s;imple recital of this affecting &s;tory. I &s;hall add to it the curious remarks which Corneille has made on St. Ambro&s;e, to con|&s;ole him&s;elf for the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his tragedy. &mdash;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Certes il y a de quoi congratuler &agrave; la puret&eacute; de notre th&eacute;&acirc;tre, de voir qu'une hi&s;toire qui fait le plus bel ornement du &s;econd livre des Vierges de Saint Am|broi&s;e, &s;e trouve trop licentieu&s;e pour y &ecirc;tre &s;upport&eacute;e.

on the purity of our theatre, in &s;ee|ing that a &s;tory, which forms the mo&s;t beautiful ornament in St. Ambro&s;e's &s;e|cond book upon virgins, is found too li|centious to be endured.

<P>The third book of St. Ambro&s;e opens with a recital of many pious precepts, delivered to Marcellina, the &s;i&s;ter of our &s;aint, by the pope Liberius, on the day when &s;he re|ceived the veil from his hands. The points which the pontiff particularly recom|mended were, temperance and taciturnity the latter is perpetually enjoined by the fa|thers, as one of the capital perfections in a con&s;ecrated virgin. St. Ambro&s;e pays his &s;i&s;ter the compliment of acknowledging, that her virtue had not only equalled, but even exceeded, the di&s;cipline of Liberius, and &s;pecifies her great merit in the articles of ab&s;tinence and prayer. Yet, notwith&s;tand|ing the extreme &s;anctity of her character, he pre&s;ents to her a long admonition concern|ing the dangers that attend the gaiety of nuptial entertainments, and the wanton enormity of dancing. He then an&s;wers a
<PB N="23" REF="25">
que&s;tion of Marcellina's, on a very delicate topic, Whether the religion which forbids &s;elf-de&s;truction, allows the virgin to de&s;troy her own life for the pre&s;ervation of her faith and her virginity? St. Ambro&s;e de|cides the point, by the example of Pelagia, a virgin of Antioch, who, at the age of fifteen, threw her&s;elf into a river to e&s;cape from licentious per&s;ecution. The particulars of Pelagia's death are &s;ingularly &s;triking, and the flouri&s;hes of St. Ambro&s;e, in relating her &s;tory, not le&s;s &s;o. The &s;pirit of this young martyr induced her virgin &s;i&s;ters, and even her mother, to &s;hare her fate. St. Am|bro&s;e de&s;cribes this heroic family advancing, hand in hand, to the brink of a torrent, with their per&s;ecutors behind them; and he makes the&s;e undaunted females addre&s;s the river in the following expre&s;&s;ions:&mdash;
<Q>Be|hold the water! who forbids us to be baptized? Let the water receive us, which is the &s;ource of regeneration&mdash;let the water receive us, by which virgins are made &mdash; let the water receive us,

&mdash;The &s;aint relates, that they added to this addre&s;s a &s;hort prayer for the decent pre&s;ervation of their bodies; "after which," &s;ays he,

<P>In the clo&s;e of his elaborate treati&s;e, St. Ambro&s;e enters into a long and very warm vindication of his own conduct. He had been accu&s;ed, it &s;eems (and certainly with ju&s;tice) of alluring young maidens to relin|qui&s;h the natural idea of &s;ettling them|&s;elves in marriage, and to take the mona&s;tic vow. In&s;tead of denying, he glories in the charge. "Can that conduct," exclaims the &s;aint,
<Q>be con&s;idered as a crime in me, which has always reflected honour on the prie&s;thood, to &s;ow the &s;eeds of perfection, and promote an attachment to virginity?</Q>
&mdash;He then proceeds to examine, whether his doctrine can be cen&s;ured, either as di&s;|hone&s;t, or new, or unprofitable; and his rea&s;oning on the&s;e three points is highly cu|rious:&mdash;"If you call it di&s;hone&s;t," &s;ays the &s;aint,
<Q>you mu&s;t al&s;o apply that appella|tion to the life of the angels; for they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Can it be condemned as a novelty? I
<PB N="26" REF="28">
con&s;ent to abjure all things as novelties, which are not taught us by Chri&s;t; but does he not deliver the &s;ame doctrine, when he &s;ays, 'There are eunuchs which have made them&s;elves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. chap. xix.</NOTE>.' Virginity is therefore &s;anctified by a cele&s;tial voice, and recommended by the precepts of our Lord.&mdash;But &s;ince we have thus proved, that the doctrine of continence is neither di&s;hone&s;t nor new, let us enquire if it can be reckoned unprofitable. I have heard many people exclaim, that the world is peri&s;hing&mdash;that the human race will be|come extinct &mdash; that wedlock is ruined. I only a&s;k, in reply, did ever any man &s;eek a wife without being able to find one?&mdash;If any one thinks that the human race will be dimini&s;hed by the con&s;ecra|tion of virgins, let him con&s;ider, that where there are few virgins, there are fewer men. Where the devotion to vir|ginity

is frequent, there the number of men is much greater. Ob&s;erve what multitudes are annually admitted to the veil in the churches of the Ea&s;t, and of Africa.

<P>With the citation of this curious fact, I &s;hall clo&s;e my account of St. Ambro&s;e's larger treati&s;e on virgins, as the re&s;idue of that work con&s;i&s;ts only of pa&s;&s;ages from &s;cripture very whim&s;ically united.</P>
<P>The &s;econd compo&s;ition of our illu&s;trious &s;aint, on this intere&s;ting topic, is entitled, "An Exhortation to Virgins." It was written as a compliment to Juliana, an opulent widow, who, having devoted her whole family, con|&s;i&s;ting of a &s;on and three daughters, to a re|ligious life, employed her fortune in build|ing
<PB N="28" REF="30">
a church at Florence, which &s;he re|que&s;ted St. Ambro&s;e to con&s;ecrate. Upon this ceremony the &s;aint introduces Juliana in his di&s;cour&s;e, extolling to her children the excellence of virginity in oppo&s;ition to marriage. He makes her declare, that al|though &s;he had a good hu&s;band, &s;he la|ments that &s;he was ever married; and that nothing can con&s;ole her for having forfeited, in her own per&s;on, the grace of virginity, but the hope of proving the mother of holy virgins. But the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;age in this &s;ingular work is a very whim&s;ical pun. St. Ambro&s;e, deriving the word <HI>nu|bere,</HI> to marry, from <HI>nubes,</HI> a cloud, pur&s;ues his conceit with great &s;olemnity, and gravely demon&s;trates the &s;imilitude between a mar|ried woman and a heavy exhalation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Et ver&egrave; graves nubes, quae &s;u&s;tinent &s;arcinam matrimonii.

<P>The third work, which St. Ambro&s;e de|voted to the holy &s;i&s;terhood, has two differ|ent titles, being &s;ometimes called <HI>The In&s;ti|tution of a Virgin,</HI> and &s;ometimes, <HI>A Di&s;|cour&s;e on the perpetual Virginity of the Virgin Mary,</HI> which St. Ambro&s;e very zealou&s;ly &s;upported again&s;t Bono&s;us, a bi&s;hop con|demned by the council of Capua, for the oppo&s;ite opinion. The &s;aint alledges &s;ix arguments in favour of the point which he intends to prove; but, as the Catholic cri|tics ju&s;tly ob&s;erve that &s;ome of the&s;e argu|ments have more wit than &s;olidity, I &s;hall decline an account of them, from a reve|rence to the hallowed per&s;onage of whom they &s;peak.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. On St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, and his Panegyric on Virginity.</HEAD>
<P>IF the pious virgins of Italy had rea&s;on to admire the zeal which the holy Am|bro&s;e di&s;played in their behalf, tho&s;e of Con&s;tantinople enjoyed a patron and pa&s;tor yet more admirable in the famous St. Chry|&s;o&s;tom, who equalled the archbi&s;hop of Milan in his enthu&s;ia&s;tic veneration for ce|libacy, with the in&s;inuating advantage of a &s;uperior eloquence. This talent, from which he received the appellation of Chry|&s;o&s;tom, or the golden mouth, had rai&s;ed him from the condition of a &s;eque&s;tered monk, to pre&s;ide over the clergy of the Ea&s;tern em|pire: but his elevation, though propitious to his glory, was fatal to his peace. The au&s;terity of a hermit was ill &s;uited to the manners of a corrupt metropolis. The in|flexible
<PB N="31" REF="33">
prelate engaged in a dangerous quarrel with the empre&s;s Eudoxia, and, af|ter &s;u&s;taining his epi&s;copal office nine years, under the vici&s;&s;itudes of triumph and di&s;|grace, he expired in 407, at the age of &s;ixty, and in the mid&s;t of hard&s;hips inflicted on him as a per&s;ecuted exile.</P>
<P>I have already had occa&s;ion to quote &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from this accompli&s;hed &s;aint, in &s;peaking of the unorthodox cohabitation of prie&s;ts and virgins; a licentious, or at lea&s;t an offen&s;ive cu&s;tom, which Chry&s;o&s;|tom had the honour of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, by his eloquent invectives. In the&s;e we have &s;een, that the holy father be&s;towed on virgi|nity the mo&s;t magnificent prai&s;e; but I am yet to give an account of a long and regular panegyric, which he compo&s;ed expre&s;sly on this favourite topic.</P>
<P>He opens this elaborate treati&s;e with a &s;e|vere condemnation of all heretical virgins, whom he &s;inks to a condition below that of the Chri&s;tian adultere&s;s. He uncharitably repre&s;ents the Pagan Old Maid as an imme|diate
<PB N="32" REF="34">
mini&s;ter of the devil; nay, he will not allow that &s;he could be a virgin; for, al|though her per&s;on was pure, yet her &s;oul, the more important part, was corrupted:&mdash; "And what," cries the animated &s;aint,
<Q>what is the advantage, if the temple be demoli&s;hed, that the ve&s;tibule &s;tands en|tire?</Q></P>
<P>He proceeds, with great &s;ubtlety, to &s;hew,
<Q>that he who condemns marriage, dimi|ni&s;hes the glory of true virginity; and that he who prai&s;es wedlock, does the highe&s;t honour to celibacy: for that which is con&s;idered as good, on a com|pari&s;on with evil, may be not eminently good; but that which is better than a ble&s;&s;ing of univer&s;al e&s;timation, mu&s;t be &s;upremely excellent; and in this light,</Q>
continues the &s;aint,
<Q>we recommend vir|ginity. Matrimony is good; and on this account virginity is marvellous, becau&s;e it is better than good <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.
<BIBL>Sanct. Chry&s;. tom. iv. p. 322. edit. Par.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and, if you wi&s;h
<PB N="33" REF="35">
it, I will inform you how far it is better; as much as heaven is better than earth, and angels than men.</Q></P>
<P>In this compari&s;on, St. Chry&s;o&s;tom only echoes the &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion which we have already &s;een in more than one of his predece&s;&s;ors: but this eloquent enco|mia&s;t of virginity was of a &s;pirit too ani|mated to content him&s;elf with a &s;ervile re|petition, and we accordingly find him pur|&s;uing this idea, with addre&s;s and vigour pe|culiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After &s;aying, that virginity is as much &s;u|perior to wedlock, as angels are to men, he exclaims,
<Q>Or, to &s;peak with ju&s;t energy, yet more; for the angels, if they neither marry nor are given in marriage, are not compounded of fle&s;h and blood; they have no &s;ettlement on earth, they feel not the perturbations of de&s;ire. They neither hunger nor thir&s;t, they have no organs which can be &s;oftened by mu&s;ic or fa&s;ci|nated by beauty; but, as the meridian &s;ky, where no clouds are collected, ap|pears
<PB N="34" REF="36">
pure, &s;o their nature, unclouded by mortal pa&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be clear and lucid.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;aint proceeds to &s;hew, that virgins, under the di&s;advantage of mortality, engage in a &s;ucce&s;sful competition with the&s;e cele&s;|tial &s;pirits, and equal them in purity and perfection.&mdash;"But this," he exclaims with indignation,
<Q>this, touches not you, ye worldlings, who wa&s;te this lovely trea|&s;ure!&mdash;the portion of the unprofitable &s;ervant is re&s;erved for you: but to the virgins of the church, many and great re|wards &s;hall be allotted, &s;uch as neither eye nor ear can perceive, nor human under|&s;tanding comprehend.</Q></P>
<P>He then attempts to refute the objections which have been urged again&s;t celibacy, by affirming, that marriage is by no means ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation and continuance of the human race; and, as a proof of this, he a&s;&s;erts (what other &s;aints have al&s;o main|tained) that Adam had no connubial inter|cour&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="37">
with Eve, till after their expul&s;ion from Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>He goes yet farther, and affirms, it is not virginity, but &s;in, that has a tendency to di|mini&s;h and de&s;troy the human &s;pecies, and &s;upports his remark by the hi&s;tory of the deluge.</P>
<P>The &s;aint proceeds to make many &s;evere reflections on tho&s;e who treat virginity with contempt. He expatiates on the excel|lence and the merits of the maidenly condi|tion. He dwells on the &s;evere bondage of wedlock, and particularly on the hard ca&s;e of that wife who may wi&s;h to live in a &s;tate of continence, and yet cannot lawfully refu&s;e tho&s;e care&s;&s;es to which &s;he has no inclina|tion. He contra&s;ts the &s;ingle and the mar|ried life in every point of view, and uni|formly decides in favour of the fir&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. On St. Jerom, and his various Compo&s;itions in Prai&s;e of Virginity.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL clo&s;e my catalogue of holy panegyri&s;ts with the mention of a &s;aint who was equal, and perhaps &s;uperior, to all his &s;ainted brethren, in extent of learning, in vigour of genius, and, above all, in ve|hemence of zeal for the &s;upport of virgi|nity. I mean the pa&s;&s;ionate and the witty St. Jerom, who pa&s;&s;ed a great part of his &s;in|gular life either in &s;truggling with his own turbulent de&s;ires in a lonely wilderne&s;s, or in preaching continence to the devout and rich ladies of a luxurious city. He was born about the year 345, on the confines of Dal|matia, received his education at Rome, and travelled into Gaul. He then propo&s;ed to &s;ettle in the metropolis of Italy, but the religious activity of his &s;pirit &s;oon hurried
<PB N="37" REF="39">
him into the Ea&s;t; and, having vi&s;ited the mo&s;t hallowed places of that country, he de|voted him&s;elf to a &s;tate of &s;evere&s;t mortifi|cation in the de&s;erts of Syria. Sickne&s;s drove him to Antioch; from thence he was led to Con&s;tantinople by his de&s;ire of con|ver&s;ing with St. Gregory Nazianzen. Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical bu&s;ine&s;s now carried him to Rome, and it was at this advanced period of his life that he became the favourite pre|ceptor of many Roman ladies, who, while they attended his exhortations to cha&s;tity, were very wantonly cen&s;ured for their de|vout familiarity with this eloquent enthu&s;i|a&s;t. The attachment of his female di&s;ciples, though probably very innocent, was un|doubtedly very &s;trong, as &s;ome of them followed him into the Holy Land, where he ended an unquiet but illu&s;trious life, at the age of four&s;core. Among the&s;e di&s;ciples, a widow, who&s;e name was Paula, attracted the notice of the world by her rank and for|tune, and &s;till more by the fervency of her devotion. The ardent friend&s;hip which
<PB N="38" REF="40">
St. Jerom profe&s;&s;ed for this lady had a con|&s;iderable influence on his life and writings. What he &s;uffered, and what he enjoyed, in the pious connection, he has him&s;elf very forcibly de&s;cribed, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to A&s;ella, a religious maiden of peculiar &s;anc|tity. In &s;peaking of the Roman ladies, he &s;ays,

<P>This caution is followed by a very &s;trik|ing picture of the di&s;&s;olute manners which prevailed in that age. The ladies and the clergy are treated with equal &s;everity by the indignant Jerom; their vices are de|&s;cribed with that &s;ingular vehemence of angry wit, that energy of metaphor, by which the writings of this eloquent father are peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed:
<Q>I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay,</Q>

<P>The &s;aint proceeds to contra&s;t with the&s;e licentious manners the extreme purity of his young di&s;ciple, in which he exhorts her to per&s;evere with various precepts; he dwells chiefly on ab&s;tinence and nightly prayer. He recommends to her &s;everal authors, who had written on virgins&mdash;Tertullian, St. Cy|prian, his friend Dama&s;us the Roman pon|tiff, who celebrated virginity both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, but, above all, the treati&s;e of St.

<P>There is a very plea&s;ing peculiarity in this generous &s;aint; I mean, his cu&s;tom of relating a little hi&s;tory of his own frailties, to form a more forcible le&s;&s;on for the u&s;e of his di&s;ciple. Of this we have already &s;een one example, in the narration of his wanton thoughts in the de&s;ert. A &s;econd now oc|curs, on the &s;ubject of profane literature He confe&s;&s;es to his fair pupil, that, after &s;pending &s;ome time in his &s;acred &s;tudies, in fa&s;ting and prayer, he u&s;ed to amu&s;e him|&s;elf with the comedies of Plautus, which delighted him &s;o much, that when he re|turned to the peru&s;al of the prophets, he found them in&s;ufferably dull.

him for his attachment to the literature of the Gentiles, commanded him to be &s;courged. The con&s;cious Jerom acknow|ledges the ju&s;tice of this &s;entence, and &s;up|ports the reality of his puni&s;hment, by ap|pealing to the &s;tripes which he continued, he &s;ays, to feel after his &s;leep had left him.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of literature, St. Jerom has &s;ome curious expre&s;&s;ions concerning the li|terary magnificence of his age.

&s;ays he,

He a&s;cribes this pa&s;|&s;ion for &s;plendor to the Roman ladies, whom he repre&s;ents, in general, as full of o&s;tentation, and de&s;titute of virtue.</P>
<P>From hence he takes occa&s;ion to put his fair di&s;ciple on her guard again&s;t luxury and avarice.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of thirty years from the compo&s;ition of the&s;e in&s;tructions to the tender Eu&s;tochium, we find the ardent St. Jerom addre&s;&s;ing, with the &s;ame zeal for

cha&s;tity, another Roman virgin, of equal or &s;uperior eminence; I mean the celebrated Demetrias, the grand-daughter of Proba, a matron of the highe&s;t rank and character in Rome, who, flying from that city, when it was taken by the Goths, e&s;caped with her family, and the wreck of an immen&s;e for|tune, to the coa&s;t of Africa. The young and lovely Demetrias&mdash;inflamed with a pious pa&s;&s;ion for the palm of virginity, or alarmed, perhaps, by the fate of many illu&s;|trious Roman dam&s;els, torn from their ex|iled parents, and ba&s;ely &s;old to Syrian mer|chants by the infamous. Count Heraclian, who commanded in Africa&mdash;&s;ought an a&s;y|lum in the church, by a&s;&s;uming the veil. The holy maiden was complimented by the mo&s;t eminent &s;aints of the age on this act of devotion. Nothing can more forcibly &s;hew the high con&s;equence of canonical virgins in that period, than the epi&s;tle of St. Jerom to Demetrias. After &s;ome prai&s;e be&s;towed on her own character, and that of her family, he repre&s;ents her con&s;ecration as
<PB N="49" REF="51">
an event which diffu&s;ed &s;uch univer&s;al joy throughout the Roman world, that it com|pen&s;ated in a great mea&s;ure the late over|throw of the imperial city. He affirms, that the delight and exultation of the Ro|man people, on this occa&s;ion, were &s;uperior to what they had formerly di&s;played, both when their country was delivered from the ravages of the Gauls, and when, after the fatal battles of Trebia, Thra&s;ymene, and Cannae, they fir&s;t heard of the victory which Marcellus obtained at Nola. This, &s;urely, is one of the mo&s;t hyperbolical compli|ments that was ever paid to a fair devotee, and affords us a curious proof how far the imagination of our lively &s;aint would &s;ome|times outrun his judgment. But though his zeal has overcharged the picture, we mu&s;t remember that he painted from life: and his de&s;cription of the effects produced by the con&s;ecration of this noble dam&s;el, exhibits in the &s;tronge&s;t light the maidenly enthu&s;ia&s;m of that period. After declaring that the joy of Demetrias's family was &s;uch
<PB N="50" REF="52">
as the eloquence both of Cicero and De|mo&s;thenes would be unequal to de&s;cribe, St. Jerom exclaims,

I &s;peak too faintly: all the churches of Africa exulted; the fame of the pious virgin pervaded every city, every town, every village, to the mo&s;t lonely hut; all the i&s;lands between Africa and Italy were filled with the joyful tidings. Then Italy threw off her garb of mourning, and the half-demoli&s;hed walls of Rome recovered a part of their pri&s;tine &s;plendor, her God being deemed propitious in this perfect conver&s;ion of her daughter. You would
<PB N="51" REF="53">
have thought the race of Goths ex|tingui&s;hed, and all her ba&s;e enemies &s;truck dead by the avenging thunder of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>Having repre&s;ented the effects of her con&s;ecration in the&s;e flattering colours, St. Jerom proceeds to favour this illu&s;trious virgin with many precepts for the mainte|nance of her purity. He dwells on the u&s;ual topics of temperance and prayer. He ingeniou&s;ly compares the virgin, who lives cha&s;tely in the warmth of youth, to tho&s;e holy per&s;ons who continued unhurt in the fiery furnace. To the rich virgin he ob|&s;erves, that it is more meritorious to employ a large fortune in charitable donations to the poor, than in building a co&s;tly and &s;plendid church. He advi&s;es his fair pupil to amu&s;e her&s;elf with manual work. He cautions her again&s;t the in&s;idious doctrine of the heretic Rufinus. He exhorts her never to hear any conver&s;ation between a man and his wife, as &s;uch dialogues are of
<PB N="52" REF="54">
an infectious nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ne audias quid vel maritus uxori, vel uxor lo|cuta &s;it viro; venenatae &s;unt huju&s;cemodi confabula|tiones.

<P>The &s;aint then &s;peaks of his own former compo&s;ition on the pre&s;ervation of virgi|nity; a work, he &s;ays, which rai&s;ed to him many enemies, on account of the hone&s;t freedom with which he arraigned the vices of the time. He is &s;till, however, equally &s;evere on female licentiou&s;ne&s;s: "Many," &s;ays he,

He concludes with ex|horting his cha&s;te di&s;ciple to love the &s;crip|ture; and, what has a ludicrous tendency to overthrow all his favourite doctrine, he en|treats her to revere her <HI>grandmother</HI> as a model of perfection.</P>
<P>The re&s;pectful love which St. Jerom had conceived for virginity was &s;o great, that it appears to have been the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of his life, and may be traced in almo&s;t all his writings. In his letters to different friends who had con&s;ulted him on the education of their female infants, he di&s;covers the mo&s;t ardent and anxious de&s;ire to form, from the cradle, a religious Old Maid. In advi&s;ing a lady, who&s;e name was Laeta, to teach her little daughter to read by letters of box or ivory, he gives her a particular caution to let no boys come near the infant maiden. The whole letter is curious, as it circum|&s;tantially
<PB N="54" REF="56">
de&s;cribes the very &s;ingular cau|tions which St. Jerom thought nece&s;&s;ary to form a female character of accompli&s;hed purity.&mdash;But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to &s;peak of the two more elaborate works of this &s;aint, in which his predominant pa&s;&s;ion may be &s;aid to bur&s;t forth with the greate&s;t fervency. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a treati&s;e on the perpe|tual virginity of the Virgin Mary, in oppo|&s;ition to Helvidius, who had attempted to prove, by pa&s;&s;ages from the go&s;pel, that, after the birth of our Saviour, the Virgin Mary had other children by her hu&s;band Jo&s;eph. After replying to all the argu|ments of his adver&s;ary with great acutene&s;s and &s;trength of rea&s;on, St. Jerom indulges him&s;elf in a rhetorical de&s;cription of the two oppo&s;ite characters, a virgin and a wife; and he concludes his treati&s;e by magnifying the pre-eminence of the former with all the lively &s;pirit of eloquent enthu&s;ia&s;m.&mdash;The &s;econd is a work, in which the zeal of our &s;aint, for the honour of virginity, aro&s;e to a &s;till higher pitch; I mean his an&s;wer to

Jovinian. This Italian monk, of a mode|rate and re&s;pectable character, had very can|didly a&s;&s;erted, that the married women and, virgins, who, lived in equal obedience to the laws of the go&s;pel, were equally meri|torious. The indignation of the zealous Jerom took fire at this a&s;&s;ertion; he could not bear that tho&s;e objects of his idolatry, the pure virgins of the church, &s;hould be thus placed on a level with women deba&s;ed, in his idea, even by a legal cohabitation with man. He is &s;o hurried on by the ve|hemence of his anger, that he exclaims, in the opening of his reply,
<Q>How &s;hall I check my&s;elf, and not indulge the wea|pon &s;o impatient to &s;trike in the cau&s;e of virginity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Unde cohibebo cur&s;um, nec indulgebo mucroni jam nunc pro virginitate ferire cupienti?

Indeed, the warm &s;aint appears utterly unable to conduct the con|trover&s;y with any degree of temper. Com|paring the candid doctrine of his adver&s;ary

to the hi&s;&s;ing of the old &s;erpent, he threa|tens to cru&s;h him as the mo&s;t vile and per|nicious of reptiles.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ionate compo&s;itions of a bold and vigorous mind, enriched with exten&s;ive learning, are generally entertaining, though full of error and ab&s;urdity. There is an attractive energy in &s;atirical wit, however de&s;titute of truth, when it is &s;harpened by indignation or envy. It is owing, perhaps, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to this forcible charm, that &s;ome unju&s;t compo&s;itions of two very different authors, Voltaire and Dr. John|&s;on, have been read with peculiar avidity. In many &s;trokes of per&s;onal character, and in the compact vigour of their &s;tyle, the&s;e great writers both re&s;embled St. Jerom. Sarca&s;tic imagination and literary pride were, perhaps, the predominant characte|ri&s;tics of this &s;ingular triumvirate; they all delighted to exert the talent which they all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of blowing an adver&s;ary to pieces with a &s;parkling explo&s;ion of irritable wit.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">The mild and unfortunate Jovinian, though he had mercy and ju&s;tice on his &s;ide, &s;unk under the vindictive eloquence of St. Jerom, who &s;upported again&s;t his antagoni&s;t the pre-eminence of his favou|rite virginity by a variety of arguments, and a torrent of &s;acred and prophane eru|dition. The &s;aint very artfully perverts many texts of &s;cripture to his purpo&s;e, and from &s;ome of them draws a wonderful in|ference again&s;t the purity of matrimonial duties <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Si ab&s;tinemus nos a coitu, honorem tribuimus uxoribus; &s;i non ab&s;tinemus, per&s;picuum e&s;t honori contrariam e&s;&s;e contumeliam.
<BIBL>Sanct. Hieron.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. He dwells on the authority of St. Paul, in his famous exhortation to celi|bacy. He affirms that virgins are more beloved by heaven, becau&s;e their &s;acrifice is not enjoined, but voluntary. He de|clares, there is as much difference between marriage and virginity, as between not &s;in|ning and doing good.</P>
<P>Having made the utmo&s;t of tho&s;e texts
<PB N="58" REF="60">
in &s;cripture, which could be converted to the honour of virginity, he proceeds to &s;hew, that a &s;tate of continence was no new e&s;tabli&s;hment, introduced in oppo&s;ition to nature by the Chri&s;tian church, but of an|cient and univer&s;al e&s;timation. In this part of his treati&s;e, he gives an ample cata|logue of the mo&s;t eminent &s;uppo&s;ed virgins of the Pagan world, not omitting the Ca|milla and Harpalice of Virgil. He men|tions the tradition of the Indian Gymno&s;o|phi&s;ts, that the founder of their religious in|&s;titutions was generated from the &s;ide of a virgin. He conde&s;cends to repeat even the Grecian fable concerning Plato's mother, who was &s;aid to have been impregnated by a phantom of Apollo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phanta&s;mate Apollinis.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal points of religious doc|trine which St. Jerom di&s;putes with his an|tagoni&s;t, but I touch only on that which is particularly connected with the &s;ubject of this E&s;&s;ay. This, indeed, is the point for which
<PB N="59" REF="61">
the angry &s;aint mo&s;t vehemently contends. His indignation &s;eems to have been parti|cularly rou&s;ed by the great eagerne&s;s with which the Roman ladies had embraced the liberal maxims of his opponent. Some canonical virgins, convinced by Jovi|nian of the innocence and the merits of matrimony, had dropped the veil, and preferred the warm protection of a hu&s;|band, to the chilling &s;helter of the church. St. Jerom, in the clo&s;e of his invective, very forcibly de&s;cribes the popularity of his antagoni&s;t. He laments that the rich and noble received him with deference and affection. He repre&s;ents him as the pre|ceptor of impurity, &s;urrounded by multi|tudes of la&s;civious women, who have lo&s;t, not only their mode&s;ty, but all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame; "and who di&s;play more wantonne&s;s," &s;ays the &s;aint,
<Q>in the argumentative defence of their de&s;ire, than in its actual exertion.</Q>
&mdash; He concludes with a &s;pirited addre&s;s to Rome, as the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world. He be&s;eeches the imperial city to act in con|formity
<PB N="60" REF="62">
to her ancient reputation, to be ex|alted by virtue, and not humbled by plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Though Jovinian &s;eems to have had a large majority of the fair &s;ex on his &s;ide, his mild doctrine concerning them was for|mally condemned by eccle&s;ia&s;tical autho|rity, and he died in exile. St. Jerom aro&s;e triumphant from the conte&s;t; yet we find that many pious critics in Rome arraigned his compo&s;ition, for extolling virginity to &s;uch a pitch, by the degradation of wed|lock. In &s;ome of his letters he treats the&s;e critics with the utmo&s;t contempt. He a&s;|&s;erts, in &s;upport of his own doctrine, that the apo&s;tles were either unmarried, or conti|nent after marriage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Apo&s;toli vel virgines, vel po&s;t nuptias conti|nentes.
<BIBL>Sanct. Hieron. Epi&s;t. ad Pammachium, tom. iv. p. 242. edit. Par. 1705.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. He concludes one of his epi&s;tles on this topic with an air of jocularity, by &s;aying,

<P>Such was the doctrine, and &s;uch the &s;uc|ce&s;s, of St. Jerom, as the eulogi&s;t of virgi|nity.

But it was not the only cau&s;e which produced this effect:&mdash;to the exhor|tations of the holy fathers we may add the univer&s;al and dazzling idea of &s;upernatural power, &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide in the mona&s;tic virgin of immaculate purity. Many fe|males would enter with ambitious zeal into a &s;tate which gave them a fair pro&s;pect of acquiring the very flattering privilege of working miracles: and in tho&s;e ages, when diver&s;e miracles were a&s;cribed to the cha&s;te and pious daughters of many a convent, every nun of lively imagination, who had the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance with the legends
<PB N="65" REF="67">
of her &s;i&s;terhood, might readily hope for a privilege of which examples were &s;o com|mon. The lives of the female &s;aints con|tain an infinitude of miraculous incidents in honour of virginity. My readers would hardly thank me for reviving a large col|lection of the&s;e forgotten wonders; yet let me ob&s;erve, with the great Monte&s;quieu <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Je crois bien que c'e&s;t une fau&s;&s;et&eacute; (&s;ays this bold and manly writer, on a pa&s;&s;age in the life of an ob&s;cure &s;aint) mais c'e&s;t une fau&s;&s;et&eacute; tr&egrave;s-ancienne: le fond de la vie et les men&s;onges &s;e rapportent aux moeurs et aux loix du temps; et ce font ces moeurs et ces loix que l'on cherche ici.

I &s;hall, there|fore, &s;elect a few &s;upernatural anecdotes of pious virgins; and, to render them the more intere&s;ting, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the holy maidens of our own country. If we wi&s;hed to produce the &s;tronge&s;t example of mira|culous power a&s;cribed to martyred cha&s;tity, we might pitch on the adventures of St. O&s;itha, a religious and royal virgin of E&s;&s;ex, who, being murdered and beheaded by Da|ni&s;h pirates, in the ninth century, is &s;aid, like &s;ome poetical heroes of romance, to have carried her &s;evered head in her own hands to a church at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;pot where &s;he was &s;lain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Dani infideles.... ip&s;am &s;anctam O&s;itham capite obtruncant: at corpus exangue mox &s;e&s;e &s;ubrigit, et caput humi jacens manibus apprehendit; rectoque gradu et firmis ve&s;tigiis progrediens u&s;que ad eccle|fiam apo&s;tolorum &s;anctorum Petri et Pauli, per tria fer&egrave; &s;tadia, illud deportat: quod accidit circa an|num 870.

<P>Among the mo&s;t meritorious of our holy maidens, we ought, perhaps, to reckon the cha&s;te St. Bridget of Scotland, who, having re&s;olved on perpetual virginity, and being per&s;ecuted by the addre&s;&s;es of an ardent lover, prayed to heaven that &s;he might be relieved from his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing importunities by the &s;udden lo&s;s of her beauty.

biographers inform us, that this &s;ingular petition was immediately granted:&mdash;her lovely countenance was in&s;tantly deformed, and the dangerous lu&s;tre of her eyes was drowned in blood. But we have the con&s;o|lation of being told, by the &s;ame authority, that &s;he recovered her charms as &s;oon as her purity was perfectly &s;ecure.</P>
<P>Not to dwell on the legends of mere martyrologi&s;ts, I &s;hall relate, from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of our ancient hi&s;torians, a mi|raculous anecdote, which not only &s;hews the wonderful e&s;timation in which mona&s;tic virginity was held, but even proves that the king him&s;elf was not &s;afe, if he pre&s;umed to que&s;tion or deride the continence of a canonized virgin.</P>
<P>The celebrated William of Malm&s;bury has enlivened the hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h prelates with the following account of a religious and royal maiden, who&s;e name was Editha. This lady, the daughter of Edgar, a monarch di&s;tingui&s;hed by his military &s;pirit and his amorous adventures, was early devoted to a

life of mona&s;tic purity; and is &s;aid to have di&s;played all the gentle virtues in the mo|na&s;tery of Wilton. Though a profe&s;&s;ed nun, &s;he ventured to indulge her&s;elf in &s;plendid apparel; and when reproved by St. Ethelwold for her finery, &s;he defended her|&s;elf, with a pious vivacity, by a quotation from St. Augu&s;tin, affirming that pride was often &s;een in a &s;ordid habit, and humility in a golden ve&s;t. In her devotions &s;he was &s;o fervent, that the great St. Dun&s;tan, who be|held her during the con&s;ecration of a church which &s;he had built, was enraptured with her piety. On ob&s;erving, that &s;he fre|quently extended her thumb, to make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, this prophetic &s;aint ex|claimed, "May that ble&s;&s;ed finger never decay!" and bur&s;t into a tender pa&s;&s;ion of tears, &s;o violent as to &s;hake with his &s;ob|bing the deacon who &s;tood next him. On being a&s;ked the rea&s;on of his di&s;order, he replied,
<Q>This blooming ro&s;e will &s;oon wither; this dove, &s;o dear to heaven, will fly away from us in &s;ix weeks from this

His prophecy was accompli&s;hed: the royal virgin expired at the preci&s;e time he had foretold; and the &s;ame holy man beheld her in a vi&s;ion, walking hand in hand with the &s;ainted martyr to whom &s;he had dedicated the church, and command|ing that &s;uch reverence &s;hould be paid to her on earth as &s;he received in heaven.&mdash; Miracles became frequent at her tomb. At la&s;t it was ordered that her body &s;hould be brought forth from its grave; and her whole frame was found converted into du&s;t, except her finger, her &s;tomach, and the parts be|low it. While the holy man was amazed at the&s;e wonders, he was relieved by an ap|pearance of the virgin's &s;pirit, who &s;aid that tho&s;e parts of her body were ju&s;tly free from putrefaction, for having pre&s;erved them|&s;elves unpolluted by the two &s;en&s;ual &s;ins of wantonne&s;s and gluttony <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The curious reader may wi&s;h to &s;ee the whole account of this &s;ingular apparition, which I have &s;oftened and abridged.&mdash;<Q>Ita crebre&s;centibus ad tum|bam miraculis, edictum ut efferretur virginis corpus; inventumque totum in cineres &s;olutum, praeter digi|tum et alvum, alvoque &s;ubjecta; unde &s;ancto dubi|tanti virgo ip&s;a per vi&s;um a&s;&s;i&s;tit: dicens, non mirum e&s;&s;e &s;i partes illae corporis putruerint, quod u&s;us ha|beat exanimata corpora in quo&s;dam arcanos naturae &s;inus defluere, et ip&s;a utpot&egrave; puella membris illis peccaverit; caeter&ugrave;m ventrem nulla corrumpi ju&s;t&egrave; putredine, qui nulla unquam aculeatus &s;it libidine: immunem &s;e fui&s;&s;e crapulae et carnalis copulae.

<P>A female &s;acrifice announced to the world with &s;uch dazzling &s;plendor, mu&s;t have had great effect in extending the con|tagious pa&s;&s;ion for mona&s;tic virginity; and, in the &s;ucceeding ages, we find that many queens and prince&s;&s;es, in different kingdoms of Europe, preferred the cha&s;te comfort of mona&s;tic continence to all the parade and plea&s;ure of royal dignity. We have &s;een, in a former chapter of this E&s;&s;ay, that the married royal fair ones, as well as the &s;ingle, a&s;pired to that cele&s;tial crown of virginity, which was con&s;idered as &s;uperior to every earthly diadem; and many of the&s;e virgin wives (to give them the &s;trange appellation which they coveted) appear to have obtained, from the religious complai&s;ance of their hu&s;bands,

<P>When we con&s;ider to what oppre&s;&s;ive in|dolence, to what a variety of wretched|ne&s;s and guilt, the young and fair inhabi|tants of the cloi&s;ter were frequently be|trayed, we ought to admire tho&s;e benevo|lent authors, who, when the tide of reli|gious prejudice ran very &s;trong in favour of mona&s;tic virginity, had &s;pirit enough to op|po&s;e the torrent, and to caution the devout and tender &s;ex again&s;t &s;o dangerous a pro|fe&s;&s;ion. It is in this point of view that the character of Era&s;mus appears with the mo&s;t amiable lu&s;tre; and his name ought to be eternally dear to the female world in parti|cular. Though his &s;tudies and con&s;titu|tion led him almo&s;t to idolize tho&s;e elo|quent fathers of the church, who have magnified mona&s;tic virginity, his good &s;en&s;e, and his accurate &s;urvey of human life,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
enabled him to judge of the mi&s;ery in which female youth was continually in|volved by a precipitate choice of the veil. He knew the &s;ucce&s;sful arts by which the &s;ubtle and rapacious Monks inveigled young women of opulent families into the cloi&s;ter, and he exerted his lively and delicate wit in oppo&s;ition to &s;o per|nicious an evil. The writings of many eminent authors have been levelled again&s;t the abu&s;es of the mona&s;tic life; but &s;everal of the&s;e, like the noted work of the hu|morous Rabelais, appear to have flowed from a &s;pirit as wanton and licentious as ever lurked in a convent, and abound in language offen&s;ive to every decent reader. It is not thus with Era&s;mus; his two dia|logues, intitled, <HI>The Virgin aver&s;e to Mar|riage,</HI> and <HI>The Penitent Virgin,</HI> are written with admirable plea&s;antry, and &s;eem to have been dictated by a cha&s;te and angelic de&s;ire to promote the felicity of woman.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e nations of Europe where nun|neries &s;till exi&s;t, how many lovely victims
<PB N="84" REF="86">
are continually &s;acrificed to the avarice or ab&s;urd ambition of inhuman parents! The mi&s;ery of the&s;e victims has been painted with great force by &s;ome benevolent writers of France, and particularly by that admir|able noveli&s;t Madame de Genlis, in her Letters on Education. In mo&s;t of the&s;e pathetic hi&s;tories, that are founded on the abu&s;e of convents, the mi&s;ery originates from the parent, and falls upon the child. The rever&s;e has &s;ometimes happened; and there are examples of unhappy parents, who have been rendered mi&s;erable by the reli|gious perver&s;ity of a daughter. In the fourteenth volume of that very amu&s;ing book, the <HI>Cau&s;es C&eacute;l&eacute;bres,</HI> a book which is &s;aid to have been the favourite reading of Voltaire, there is a &s;triking hi&s;tory of a girl under age, who was tempted by pious arti|fice to &s;ettle her&s;elf in a convent, in expre&s;s oppo&s;ition to parental authority. Her pa|rents, who had vainly tried the mo&s;t tender per&s;ua&s;ion, endeavoured at la&s;t to redeem their lo&s;t child by a legal proce&s;s again&s;t

the nunnery in which &s;he was impri&s;oned. The pleadings on this remarkable trial may, perhaps, be ju&s;tly reckoned among the fine&s;t pieces of eloquence that the law|yers of France have produced. Mon&s;ieur Gillet, the advocate for the parents, repre|&s;ented, in the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t affecting language, the extreme ba&s;ene&s;s of this reli|gious &s;eduction. His eloquence appeared to have fixed the &s;entiments of the judges; but the cau&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition was pleaded by an advocate of equal power, and it finally prevailed. The unfortunate parents of Marie Vernat, for this was the name of the de|luded girl, were condemned to re&s;ign her for ever, and to make a con&s;iderable pay|ment to tho&s;e artful devotees, who had piou&s;ly robbed them of their child.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. On &s;ome Mona&s;tic Old Maids di&s;tingui&s;hed by literary Talents.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider what innumer|able multitudes of virgins have pa&s;&s;ed their lives in the lei&s;ure of a con|vent&mdash;when we reflect on the active inge|nuity of the female mind, and remember that convents, during many ages, were the trea&s;uries of all the learning that remained upon the earth&mdash;we may be &s;urpri&s;ed in ob|&s;erving the very &s;mall number of mona&s;tic Old Maids, who are &s;aid to have bequeathed to us any literary production. Perhaps, indeed, many a fair and cha&s;te author has exi&s;ted, who&s;e name and works have been unju&s;tly buried in &s;udden oblivion. I am led to this conjecture by finding that one mona&s;tic and maiden prodigy of literature has been &s;trangely overlooked or mi&s;repre|&s;ented
<PB N="89" REF="91">
by our be&s;t antiquarians; I mean the poetical Saxon nun Hro&s;vitha or Ro&s;o|vida. This lady, who flouri&s;hed about the year 980, exerted her poetical genius to confirm and encrea&s;e the number of mo|na&s;tic Old Maids. She wrote &s;ix dramatic compo&s;itions in imitation of Terence; but on &s;ubjects very different from tho&s;e of the Roman dramati&s;t, as the plays of the virgin author were chiefly intended to animate her &s;i&s;ter nuns to the pre&s;ervation of their virginity.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange that the&s;e dramatic cu|rio&s;ities are &s;o imperfectly known among us, e&s;pecially as &s;ome of our able&s;t &s;cholars have lately employed them&s;elves in elabo|rate re&s;earches on the ob&s;cure origin of the modern drama.</P>
<P>Mr. Warton, in the emendations which he has added to his &s;econd volume on Engli&s;h poetry, has, indeed, mentioned the name and title of this cha&s;te and pious dra|mati&s;t, but attributes her compo&s;itions to her fir&s;t editor Conradus Celtes, who pub|li&s;hed
<PB N="90" REF="92">
her plays and other &s;acred poems at Nurenburg, 1501.</P>
<P>Such inaccuracies are inevitable in a work &s;o various and exten&s;ive as the excel|lent Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry; and I am confident that its learned and amiable au|thor will thank me for pointing out this mi&s;take, and thus enabling him to correct his involuntary inju&s;tice towards this lite|rary phoenix of the cloi&s;ter. Though her works were re-publi&s;hed at the beginning of this century, they are &s;till &s;o rare, that I have &s;earched in vain through the libraries of our two univer&s;ities, and through &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious private collections of books in this kingdom, for a copy of her cha&s;te and intere&s;ting dramas. I have for &s;ome time delayed to clo&s;e this chapter of my E&s;&s;ay, in the hope of receiving Ro&s;o|vida from a friend on the continent; but the rare dramati&s;t not arriving as I ex|pected, and the&s;e pages being called for by the pre&s;s, I can only afford the curious reader the imperfect gratification of know|ing

<P>I &s;hould particularly regret the lo&s;s of an opportunity to enrich this E&s;&s;ay with tran&s;|lations from this rare dramatic Old Maid, had I not the hope of doing ample ju&s;tice to her merits on a future occa&s;ion.

They were printed in twenty-one volumes, octavo, with a life of the cha&s;te author, written by one of her di&s;ciples.

<P>But there are two mona&s;tic Old Maids, &s;o very remarkable, yet &s;o little known in our country, that I mu&s;t embrace the pre|&s;ent opportunity of introducing them to the acquaintance of my fair readers. The fir&s;t is a pious vi&s;ionary virgin of Venice; the &s;econd, a poetical nun of Mexico. To the Venetian virgin, who is known in France by the name of Mere Jeanne, the famous French traveller, Guillaume Po&s;tel, was indebted for mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;ingular ideas, by which he excited univer&s;al a&s;to|ni&s;hment in the age of Francis the Fir&s;t. Po&s;tel was patroni&s;ed for his exten&s;ive eru|dition by that munificent prince, to whom the learned enthu&s;ia&s;t very confidently pro|mi&s;ed univer&s;al dominion. By this pro|phecy
<PB N="95" REF="97">
in favour of France, Po&s;tel excited the enmity of &s;ome Spani&s;h Je&s;uits in Rome, which obliged him to depart from that city, and repair to Venice. It was here that the wonderful <HI>Mere Jeanne,</HI> whom he de&s;cribes as <HI>a little old woman of forty</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Une petite vieille femmelette, de l'&acirc;ge de cin|quante ans.</NOTE>, imparted to him tho&s;e my&s;teries, which he communicated to the world in a little book written in Italian, who&s;e long title is &s;o cu|rious, that I &s;hall in&s;ert an entire tran&s;lation of it:

but there is a French publication by the &s;ame author, containing the &s;ame doctrine; which con&s;i&s;ts in announcing to women an univer&s;al dominion over the world. This dominion, however, is purely &s;piritual, and means nothing more than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a more perfect rea&s;on, which beginning, according to the author, in his Venetian Virgin, was to extend over the univer&s;e, and thus confirm and perpetuate the &s;ove|reignty of woman. How far the doctrine of Po&s;tel may have been verified, and how far the &s;i&s;terhood in particular may have enjoyed that &s;overeign purity and perfec|tion of rea&s;on, which this learned man fir&s;t di&s;covered in his celebrated Venetian Old Maid, are delicate points, which the expe|rience of my fair readers will be&s;t enable them to decide.</P>

talents, that &s;he has been honoured with the title of a Tenth Mu&s;e.</P>
<P>Juana was born in November, 1651, at the di&s;tance of a few leagues from the city of Mexico. Her father was one of the many Spani&s;h gentlemen, who &s;ought to improve a &s;canty fortune by an e&s;tabli&s;hment in America, where he married a lady of that country, de&s;cended from Spani&s;h parents. Their daughter Juana was di&s;tingui&s;hed in her infancy by an uncommon pa&s;&s;ion for literature, and a wonderful facility in the compo&s;ition of Spani&s;h ver&s;es. Her pa|rents &s;ent her, when &s;he was eight years old, to re&s;ide with her uncle, in the city of Mexico. She had there the advantage of a learned education; and, as her extraordi|nary talents attracted univer&s;al regard, &s;he was patroni&s;ed by the lady of the viceroy, the Marquis de Mancera, and, at the age of &s;eventeen, was received into his family. A Spani&s;h encomia&s;t of Juana relates a re|markable anecdote, which, he &s;ays, was
<PB N="98" REF="100">
communicated to him by the viceroy him|&s;elf. That nobleman, a&s;toni&s;hed by the exten&s;ive learning of the young Juana, in|vited forty of the mo&s;t eminent literati that his country could afford, to try the extent and &s;olidity of Juana's erudition. The young female &s;cholar was freely but po|litely que&s;tioned, on the different branches of &s;cience, by theologians, philo&s;ophers, mathematicians, hi&s;torians, and poets;
<Q>and, as a royal galleon</Q>
(I u&s;e the words of his excellency the viceroy, &s;ays my Spani&s;h author)
<Q>as a royal galleon would defend her&s;elf again&s;t a few &s;callops, that might attack her, &s;o did Juana Inez extricate her&s;elf from the various que&s;tions, argu|ments, and rejoinders, that each in his own province propo&s;ed to her.</Q></P>
<P>The applau&s;e which &s;he received, on this &s;ignal di&s;play of her accompli&s;hments, was far from in&s;piring the mode&s;t Juana with vanity or pre&s;umption. Indeed, a pious humility was her mo&s;t &s;triking characte|ri&s;tic.
<PB N="99" REF="101">
Her life amounted only to forty-four years, and of the&s;e &s;he pa&s;&s;ed twenty-&s;even, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the mo&s;t exem|plary exerci&s;e of all the religious virtues, in the convent of St. Geronimo. Her delight in books was extreme, and &s;he is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a library of four thou&s;and volumes; but, towards the clo&s;e of her life, &s;he made a &s;triking &s;acrifice to charity, by &s;elling her darling books for the relief of the poor. Few female authors have been more celebrated in life, or in death more lamented. The collection of her works, in three quarto volumes, con|tains a number of panegyrics, in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, be&s;towed on this cha&s;te poete&s;s by the mo&s;t illu&s;trious characters both of Old and New Spain. The mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the Spani&s;h critics, father Feyjoo, has made this general remark on Juana's compo&s;i|tions,
<Q>that they excel in ea&s;e and ele|gance, but are deficient in energy;</Q>
a failing the more remarkable, as the pious enthu&s;ia&s;m of this poetical nun was &s;o
<PB N="100" REF="102">
great, that &s;he wrote in her own blood a profe&s;&s;ion of her faith. Let me ob&s;erve, in an&s;wer to her critic, that mo&s;t of Juana's ver&s;es are written on &s;ubjects, where poe|tical energy was not to be expected. Many of her poems are occa&s;ional compliments to her particular friends; and, in her &s;acred dramas, the ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;titions of her country were &s;ufficient to annihilate all poe|tical &s;ublimity.</P>
<P>In one of her &s;hort productions, &s;he de|&s;cribes the inju&s;tice of men towards her own &s;ex. I &s;hall clo&s;e my brief account of this admirable maiden with an imitation of this performance, taking the liberty, how|ever, to omit &s;everal &s;tanzas. It is, I think, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;pecimen that I could &s;e|lect from her poetry, and has a particular claim to a place in this E&s;&s;ay, &s;ince it may be regarded as a vindication of Old Maids, compo&s;ed by a virgin of eminence and au|thority.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. On &s;ome Old Maids of the new World.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL of the Spani&s;h writers, in giving an early account of the we&s;|tern world, which they had ju&s;t di&s;covered, and were eager to make known, have de|&s;cribed the wantonne&s;s and the &s;ervility of the American females in colours that are di&s;graceful to human nature. The rela|tions of Peter Cieca de Leon, in particular, exhibit the&s;e indecent yet beautiful &s;avages in the mo&s;t deplorable point of view, and might almo&s;t lead us to imagine, that, rich as the new world appeared in many valuable productions, it never produced an Old Maid. Happily, however, for the honour of the &s;i&s;terhood, there aro&s;e in that country a Spani&s;h hi&s;torian, who, being de&s;cended from a prince&s;s of Peru, engaged with pa|triotic ardour in the noble ta&s;k of vindicat|ing
<PB N="104" REF="106">
the purity of the Peruvian ladies. The Inca Garcila&s;o de la Vega opens the fourth book of his Royal Commentaries with a circum&s;tantial account of the virgins devoted to the &s;un.&mdash;"In the fal&s;e religion of Peru," &s;ays the hi&s;torian,
<Q>there were many things truly great and re&s;pectable; one of the&s;e was the profe&s;&s;ion of perpetual virginity, which the women pre&s;erved in many hou&s;es of retirement, built for them in many pro|vinces of the empire: and, that it may be under&s;tood what women the&s;e were, to whom they were devoted, and in what they were exerci&s;ed, I &s;hall de&s;cribe them minutely, becau&s;e the Spani&s;h hi&s;torians, who treat of this point, pa&s;s over it, ac|cording to the vulgar proverb, like <HI>a cat over coals</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Como Gato por bra&s;as.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>This illu&s;trious author then enters into every particular relating to the&s;e religious virgins, de&s;cribing, from his own know|ledge, the exact &s;ituation of the building in
<PB N="105" REF="107">
the city of Cu&s;co, where they had formerly re&s;ided: &mdash; he contradicts the general opi|nion concerning them, and clearly proves, that they never dwelt or officiated as prie&s;|te&s;&s;es in the temple of the Sun; on the con|trary, he a&s;&s;erts, that the Incas took parti|cular care that no men &s;hould enter into the man&s;ion of the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered maidens, and no women into that of the Sun&mdash;two di&s;|tinct buildings, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, which Garcila&s;o tells us he had &s;een entire, as they were pre&s;erved with particular veneration by the Peruvians, in that memorable conflagration, when, re|volting again&s;t their Spani&s;h oppre&s;&s;ors, they burnt the city of Cu&s;co.</P>
<P>The&s;e virgins, although they did not re|&s;ide in the Temple of the Sun, were &s;till con&s;idered as the wives of that radiant power, whom they re&s;pected as the proge|nitor of their princes. They were all of royal blood&mdash;their number was not limited, "but commonly amounted," &s;ays the hi&s;|torian, "to more than fifteen hundred."</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">The&s;e ingenious maidens employed them&s;elves in working a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly for their nominal hu&s;band, the Sun; and, as he had no immediate occa&s;ion for the &s;plendid ve&s;t|ments they fa&s;hioned for him, it was their cu&s;tom to pre&s;ent his natural heir, the reigning Inca, with the rich and elegant productions of their manual labour. It is remarkable, that the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered virgins were liable to that inhuman puni&s;hment which was inflicted on the frail ve&s;tals of Rome; and, towards the per&s;on who &s;e|duced them from their vows of cha&s;tity, the Peruvian law was &s;till more &s;evere than the Roman; it not only took the life of the daring offender him&s;elf, but extended to all the unfortunate beings to whom he was re|lated: all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were to be laid de&s;olate, that the earth might retain no traces of a wretch, who had impiou&s;ly vio|lated a hallowed &s;pou&s;e of the Sun.</P>
<P>But whether the maids of Peru were purer in con&s;titution than the Roman ve&s;|tals, or whether the Peruvian heroes had
<PB N="107" REF="109">
not, like tho&s;e of Rome, that audacity of character, which delights to plunge into the deepe&s;t guilt, we are a&s;&s;ured that Cu&s;co was not inured, like Rome, to the horrid &s;pec|tacle of burying frail virgins alive.&mdash;
<Q>Such was the law,</Q>
&s;ays the hi&s;torian of Peru,
<Q>but the execution of it was never &s;een, becau&s;e no per&s;on was ever found to have offended again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P>The horror and indignation with which the Peruvians regarded tho&s;e Spani&s;h ruf|fians who profaned this virgin &s;anctuary, are happily expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e &s;pirited ver&s;es of Dr. Warton, intitled, <HI>The Dying Indian.</HI>&mdash; The warrior thus exults at his death, in the idea of having avenged the injured maidens of his country.</P>

<P>The community of holy virgins had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome centuries in Peru, before that unfortunate empire became the victim of Spani&s;h avarice, hypocri&s;y, and oppre&s;|&s;ion: yet tho&s;e hi&s;torical &s;ceptics, who de|light to &s;tart a doubt on the exi&s;tence of di&s;tant virtue, might intimate, with &s;ome plau&s;ibility, that this numerous community of nominal virgins never contained, perhaps, a &s;ingle genuine Old Maid. They might &s;ay, that as the reigning Inca had the privi|lege of vi&s;iting the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered ladies (as he was the acknowledged repre&s;entative of that radiant luminary to whom they all pro|fe&s;&s;ed a connubial obedience) every virgin-wife
<PB N="109" REF="111">
of the Sun would be eager to con&s;um|mate her marriage, by receiving the care&s;&s;es of his imperial proxy.</P>
<P>But to invalidate &s;uch a &s;ceptical objec|tion again&s;t the perpetual virginity of the Peruvian nuns, it may be &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve, that, be&s;ides the fifteen hundred vir|gins who were confined in Cu&s;co, there were many hou&s;es of retirement in different provinces of the empire, where the mo&s;t lovely dam&s;els were &s;eque&s;tered, as the wives or concubines of the reigning Inca. And &s;uch was the religious veneration which the fair Peruvians entertained for their prince, that, if we may believe their hi&s;torian, every beautiful virgin con&s;idered it as the height of felicity to be made a captive during life, for the mere chance of contributing to the plea&s;ures of her royal ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The courteous Garcila&s;o is &s;o &s;olicitous to vindicate the cha&s;tity of the fair Peru|vians, that he informs us, there were other ladies, who did not live in a &s;tate of &s;eclu|&s;ion

He a&s;&s;ures us, that he was per&s;onally acquainted with a mo&s;t re|&s;pectable old lady of this cla&s;s, who was both a friend and a relation of the prince&s;s his mother. Whoever con&s;iders this honourable te&s;timony in their favour, will readily, I tru&s;t, admit that primitive Old Maids ex|i&s;ted in the we&s;tern world, before it was enlightened by its European invaders.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this part of my &s;ubject without paying a ju&s;t compliment to that immortal, though fictitious, maiden of Peru, the Zilia of Madame de Graffigny.&mdash;Who|ever wi&s;hes to be more acquainted with the Virgins of the Sun, may find both informa|tion and delight in the Peruvian Letters; a work that, for delicacy of &s;entiment, and vivacity of de&s;cription, is inferior, per|haps, to no performance which the literary world has received from the tender and lively imagination of woman.</P>

by paying the mo&s;t tender deference to the fair &s;ex, and by &s;etting the highe&s;t value on the virtue of cha&s;tity.

The beatitude which departed warriors were &s;up|po&s;ed to enjoy in the&s;e two regions of eter|nal delight, appears to have con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in being attended by virgins; and the learn|ed Key&s;ler &s;uppo&s;es, that Mahomet was in|debted to the ancient Scythians for this al|luring idea <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Mahomed enim nihil novi hac parte e&s;&s;inxit et pollicitus e&s;t a&s;&s;eclis; &s;ed quod in vicinis gentibus, Scytharum progenie, et Turcis imprimis fort&egrave; vide|bat &s;uis arridere, id in novam, quam adornabat, reli|gionem tran&s;tulit.

<P><PB N="113" REF="115">The Gothic maid, who per&s;evered in her cha&s;tity, had indeed a peculiar claim to di&s;|tinction in the regions of the dead, &s;ince, ac|cording to the popular creed of her country, &s;he was expo&s;ed, when living, to trials of the mo&s;t extraordinary and tremendous nature, ari&s;ing from the influence of Runic &s;pells. In the &s;ingular little poem, in which Odin enumerates his own magical powers, he de|clares, that

<Q>it was be|lieved, that by a certain Runic compo&s;i|tion, the mind of any dam&s;el, however aver&s;e to love, might be rendered pliant to the entreaties of her admirer&mdash;but if the lover, who attempted to form this amorous &s;pell, made any mi&s;take, even in tracing a &s;ingle letter of the charm, in|&s;tead of in&s;piring his fair one with love,
<PB N="114" REF="116">
he deprived her of health, and loaded her with &s;uch bodily infirmities, as could be cured only by a more &s;kilful ma&s;ter of this intere&s;ting magic, who might di&s;co|ver the errors of the imperfect &s;pell, and remove the evil it produced by a new in|cantation.</Q></P>

The &s;ource of the lady's malady was detected, and &s;he was re&s;tored to health by the &s;uperior magical talents of Egill the poet.</P>
<P>If the heroes of the North, endued as

The Goths, in particular, were not only attentive to female honour, in re|&s;pect to the women of their own nation; but they paid the highe&s;t regard to the cha&s;tity of their fair captives, in the mo&s;t licentious hours of victory and plunder. When the Gothic king Totila made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Rome, he exerted &s;o much care in pre&s;erv|ing the women from violation, that, accord|ing to the hi&s;torian Procopius,
<Q>not a &s;ingle virgin, or matron, or widow, was di&s;ho|noured <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ita ut non virginis, non matrisfamilias, non vi|duae ullius corpori illu&s;um &s;it: unde magna illi mo|de&s;tiae fama.&mdash;<BIBL>Procopii, lib. iii.&mdash;Grotii Hi&s;t.

<P>A tender veneration for the fair &s;ex was a characteri&s;tic of the northern barbarians, to which Cae&s;ar and Tacitus have borne a more early and a very honourable te&s;timony. The latter has pre&s;erved the names of two Northern Old Maids, who appear to have been idolized by their gallant countrymen for their prophetical &s;agacity. The mo&s;t eminent of the&s;e was Veleda, a virgin who
<PB N="117" REF="119">
had exten&s;ive authority over that warlike tribe the Bructeri, according to the cu&s;|tom of the Germans, &s;ays Tacitus, which led them to wor&s;hip their prophetic fe|males as godde&s;&s;es. Veleda maintained her dignity with all the circum&s;pection that is proper for a maiden of a charac|ter &s;o important. She re&s;ided in a lofty tower, and admitted not to her pre&s;ence the Roman emi&s;&s;aries who wi&s;hed to conver&s;e with her <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Sed coram adire, alloquique Veledam, negatum.

She had, however, a virgin &s;ucce&s;&s;or in her religious office, who&s;e name was Ganna; and from this circum&s;tance Mr. Pellontier, in his elaborate hi&s;tory of the Celts, has &s;uppo&s;ed, with great probability, that in the German

<P>The active valour, and the enthu&s;ia&s;tic gallantry, which the manly barbarians of the North di&s;covered, even in their rude&s;t &s;tate, produced, in proce&s;s of time, that &s;ingular and gorgeous monument of Gothic genius, the in&s;titution of Chivalry; an in&s;titution &s;uperior, in &s;ome points of view, to every thing that we find in the antiquities of Greece and Rome; an in&s;titution peculiarly intere&s;ting to the &s;i&s;terhood of Old Maids, as one of its capital objects was the pre&s;er|vation of virginity!</P>
<P>A literary prelate of our church has at|tempted, in a &s;eries of letters, to elucidate this noble in&s;titution, and to vindicate the glory of the Gothic character:&mdash;but he has unluckily made two remarks, which would greatly deba&s;e the very character that he wi&s;hes to exalt, if they were not, like many of his critical opinions, entirely devoid of all &s;o|lid
<PB N="119" REF="121">
foundation. As the&s;e two remarks relate to virgins, and their cha&s;te Gothic admirers and defenders, I &s;hall dwell a little on both. The learned bi&s;hop a&s;&s;erts, that the Grecian hero, or demi-god, and the Gothic knight, were characters completely &s;imilar, or, to u&s;e his own words, that
<Q>the Grecian Bac|chus and Hercules were <HI>the exact counter|parts</HI> of Sir Launcelot and Amadis de Gaule <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hurd's Letters on Chivalry, Letter iv.</NOTE>.</Q>
He quotes, indeed, the great authority of Spen&s;er for this compari&s;on; but a &s;light re&s;emblance in valour and con|que&s;t was &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e of the poet. The critic, attempting to aggrandize the Gothic name, ought, in&s;tead of adopt|ing this poetical &s;imilitude, to have &s;hewn how the Grecian differed from the more noble and more virtuous Goth. In the great point of generous cha&s;tity, the difference was extreme. In the Greek poem, that re|cords the adventures of Bacchus, one of his principal exploits is that of violating a
<PB N="120" REF="122">
&s;leeping nymph <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nonni Diony&s;. lib. xlviii.</NOTE>; and the incontinence of Hercules was &s;o notorious, that (not to men|tion his robbing an Amazonian prince&s;s of her girdle) he is &s;aid by Herodotus to have cohabited with a female mon&s;ter in Scythia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herodot. lib. iv.</NOTE>. If the Gothic heroes, Sir Launcelot and Amadis, could &s;tart into life, what puni&s;h|ment would they think &s;evere enough for a critic, who had ra&s;hly dared to call them <HI>the exact counterparts</HI> of the&s;e Grecian ravi&s;hers. In fact, no compari&s;on can be more inju|rious; for in the heroic ages, the Grecian hero appears to have taken the mo&s;t unwar|rantable liberties with every virgin that fell into his power; and the Gothic knight, on the contrary, not only defended the purity of every maid in di&s;tre&s;s, but was often bound by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths to remain a virgin him&s;elf.&mdash;The &s;econd remark of the learned bi&s;hop is equally injurious to the pure and liberal heroes of the Gothic or feudal ages: for it &s;uppo&s;es
<Q>that <HI>feudal
<PB N="121" REF="123">
gallantry</HI> was the offspring of the privilege, which the ladies then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of feudal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters on Chivalry.</NOTE>;</Q>
or, in other words, that the Gothic knights idolized the fair for their rank and riches, and not for their beauty and their virtue. We can believe, indeed, that &s;uch ideas might influence the courtly manners of a prie&s;t in the eighteenth century; but a very &s;light acquaintance with hi&s;tory and romance is &s;ufficient to convince us, that &s;uch ideas were never harboured by any true knight, in the pure&s;t ages of chivalry.</P>
<P>How far the virtue of the ladies was more re&s;pected than their rank, by the gal|lant gentry of this period, we have a &s;trik|ing example in an anecdote related by that indefatigable &s;earcher into the records of chivalry, Mr. de Sainte Palaye.</P>
<P>This curious author informs us,
<Q>that the Chevalier de la Tour, in his in&s;truc|tions addre&s;&s;ed to his daughters, about the year 1371, mentions a knight of his time, who, in pa&s;&s;ing near the ca&s;tles in|habited
<PB N="122" REF="124">
by ladies, affixed a mark of in|famy to the man&s;ion of tho&s;e, who were not worthy to receive loyal knights pur|&s;uing honour and virtue. He be&s;towed, at the &s;ame time, a ju&s;t encomium on tho&s;e who&s;e merits entitled them to pub|lic e&s;teem <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires &s;ur l'Ancienne Chevalerie, tom. i. p. 86.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>That in&s;inuating Platonic love, which mingled it&s;elf with the manners of chivalry, has often, perhaps, undermined the cha&s;tity of a re&s;olute virgin. It would be a curious &s;peculation to con&s;ider how far this refined pa&s;&s;ion has proved a treacherous de&s;troyer of Old Maids, and to trace its prevalence or decline in different ages; but, as I fear it might lead me to &s;well this little work into a formidable &s;ize, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with pointing out the &s;ubject as worthy the re&s;earches of my philo&s;ophical brethren; and only remark, that this cha&s;te yet dan|gerous affection was highly fa&s;hionable at the court of England in the year 1634, as
<PB N="123" REF="125">
we learn from one of Howell's familiar let|ters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. page 259.</NOTE>; and that it is ridiculed with much lively &s;pirit in a play of Sir William Dave|nant's, called the Platonic Lovers, repre|&s;ented in 1636.</P>
<P>Let us return to the ages of chivalry.&mdash; Notwith&s;tanding the prevalence of this pe|rilous Platonic love in tho&s;e ages, the &s;pirit of the times gave &s;uch fidelity, as well as vigour, to all the generous affections, that I am per&s;uaded many a lovely dam&s;el of that period became a perfect Old Maid, from a faithful attachment to the memory of her gallant decea&s;ed admirer. I con&s;ider the tender Mele&s;inda, Counte&s;s of Tripoli, in Pale&s;tine, as a mo&s;t re&s;pectable Old Maid of this cla&s;s. The romantic Troubadour Geoffrey Rudel became enamoured of her beauty by the mere report of her charms. He cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to throw him&s;elf at her feet. Illne&s;s &s;eized him on the voyage, and when they carried him a&s;hore, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead. The &s;ingular pa&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="124" REF="126">
knight touched the tender &s;oul of the Counte&s;s. She ha&s;tened to vi&s;it this gal|lant victim of love. He &s;till breathed&mdash; received her compa&s;&s;ionate embraces, and expired with expre&s;&s;ions of delight on the felicity of dying in her arms. The Coun|te&s;s honoured his remains with a magnifi|cent funeral, and retired to lament him, during her life, in the cha&s;te &s;olitude of the cloi&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire des Troubadours, tom. i. p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Strange as it may &s;ound, the virginity of woman will be often found to have derived its firme&s;t &s;upport from the gallantry of man; a paradox &s;ufficiently explained by the preceding &s;tory.</P>
<P>As the Greeks were utterly unacquainted with the &s;pirit of gallantry, according to the confe&s;&s;ion of their learned hi&s;torian Mr. Mitford <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of Greece, p. 122.</NOTE>, this may be one among other rea&s;ons to account for the extreme &s;carcity of elderly virgins in Greece. For our &s;uperior politene&s;s, and that happy mix|ture
<PB N="125" REF="127">
of frankne&s;s and delicacy in our man|ners towards women, by which the modern world is exalted above the ancient, we are certainly indebted to our noble ance&s;tors of the North, who exhibited, in the earlie&s;t period of their hi&s;tory, the mo&s;t generous attention to female honour in general, and a particular veneration for their intelli|gent Old Maids.</P>

<P>It is remarkable, that the argument again&s;t virginity, contained in the la&s;t couplet, ap|pears al&s;o in a Greek epigram by Paulus Silentiarius, an author of the &s;ixth century, who has de&s;cribed the church of Sancta So|phia at Con&s;tantinople in a very &s;ingular poem, and who &s;ays, in the epigram to which I allude,

<P>Let me ob&s;erve, for the credit of Chaucer,
<PB N="131" REF="132">
that he appears de&s;irous of atoning for the freedom with which he had treated virgins of every cla&s;s, by his ver&s;es on that marvellous holy maid St. Caecilia; a compo&s;ition in which he engaged, if we may believe the following introduction to it, to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from the perils of licentious indo|lence:

<P>But if Chaucer appears to have failed now and then, in his veneration towards the &s;i&s;terhood, his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the cha&s;te community are very trivial, when compared with tho&s;e of Shake&s;peare. The

Old Maid may applaud her&s;elf for po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing a charitable &s;pirit, if &s;he perfectly for|gives this &s;aucy prince of dramatic poets for the following pa&s;&s;age in his comedy of "All's well that Ends Well."</P>
<P><Q>It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to pre&s;erve virginity. Lo&s;s of virginity is rational increa&s;e; and there was never virgin got, till virginity was fir&s;t lo&s;t. That you were made of, is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lo&s;t, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, is ever lo&s;t: 'tis too cold a companion; away with it! There's little can be &s;aid in't, 'tis again&s;t the rule of nature. To &s;peak on the part of vir|ginity, is to accu&s;e your mothers; which is mo&s;t infallible di&s;obedience. He that hangs him&s;elf is a virgin; virginity mur|ders it&s;elf; and &s;hould be buried in high|ways, out of all &s;anctified limit, as a de&s;|perate offendre&s;s again&s;t nature. Virgi|nity breeds mites, much like a chee&s;e; con&s;umes it&s;elf to the very paring, and &s;o

dies with feeding its own &s;tomach. Be|&s;ides, virginity is peevi&s;h, proud, idle, made of &s;elf-love, which is the mo&s;t in|hibited &s;in in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot chu&s;e but lo&s;e by't: out with't!

Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fa&s;hion; richly &s;uited, but un&s;uitable: ju&s;t like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now.

<P><PB N="134" REF="135">Let us ob&s;erve, as an apology for our ini|mitable poet, that he has given us the pre|ceding &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t the &s;i&s;terhood as the language of a poltroon.</P>
<P>Since the per&s;onal hi&s;tory of Shake&s;peare, dark as it is, mu&s;t be &s;till peculiarly inter|e&s;ting to every Engli&s;h reader, let me ha|zard a few conjectures concerning it, that were &s;ugge&s;ted by the pa&s;&s;age I have quoted.</P>
<P>Mr. Malone, in his very ingenious and amu&s;ing attempt to a&s;certain the order in which the plays of Shake&s;peare were writ|ten, has allotted the comedy of "All's Well that Ends Well" to the year 1598. I was at fir&s;t inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, that this elegant and accurate commentator was mi&s;|taken in this article, from an idea, that Shake&s;peare could not have written &s;uch an invective again&s;t old virginity in the reign of Elizabeth, who prided her&s;elf on being the queen of Old Maids. But, re|flection has led me into a conjecture, which, fanciful as it may &s;eem to others, to me ap|pears
<PB N="135" REF="136">
to confirm the date a&s;&s;igned by Mr. Malone to this comedy; and to give al&s;o additional &s;pirit to the pa&s;&s;age, as directly pointed again&s;t the queen her&s;elf, from an hone&s;t indignation of the poet in behalf of his great friend and patron the liberal earl of Southampton. Mr. Malone, in &s;peaking of this nobleman, has ob&s;erved,
<Q>that he attended lord E&s;&s;ex on the expedition to Cadiz, in 1597, as a volunteer, and after|wards to Ireland as general of the hor&s;e, from which employment he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the peremptory orders of Queen Eli|zabeth, who was offended with him for having pre&s;umed to marry Mi&s;s Eliza|beth Vernon [in 1596] without her ma|je&s;ty's con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>Now it appears to me highly probable, that when his patron was thus injuriou&s;ly treated by the antiquated maiden queen, merely for marrying a lovely young woman, it appears, I &s;ay, highly probable, that Shake&s;peare might at this juncture point all his wit, with a generous acrimony, again&s;t
<PB N="136" REF="137">
<HI>that old virginity,</HI> which, equivocal as it was, his tyrannical &s;overeign con&s;idered as the highe&s;t of her titles. In the following year (1599) when E&s;&s;ex was in confine|ment, Lord Southampton and Lord Rut|land (as we learn from a letter of that pe|riod)
<Q>came not to the court [at Non-&s;uch] but pa&s;&s;ed their tyme in London, <HI>merely in going to plaies every day</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rowland Whyte's Letter to Sir Robert Sidney.</NOTE>.</Q>
If the comedy in que&s;tion made a part of their entertainment, as it probably did, they mu&s;t have enjoyed, with peculiar reli&s;h, this &s;pirited caricatura of old virginity, as high|ly applicable to that malevolent, affected Old Virgin, who had &s;o recently excited their anger and deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>This conjecture may at fir&s;t appear in|con&s;i&s;tent with the tradition, that Shake|&s;peare wrote The Merry Wives of Wind&s;or in the year 1601, at the reque&s;t of Eliza|beth; yet it is po&s;&s;ible, that her maje&s;ty might enjoin our poet to exhibit a carica|tura

Ju&s;t within the portal of this cave, a miraculous pipe was &s;u&s;pended, formed of tho&s;e reeds into which the nymph Syrinx was metamorpho&s;ed, when &s;he fled from the wanton pur&s;uit of the ru&s;tic God.</P>
<P>A wondrous power re&s;ided in this pipe, and rendered it an unque&s;tionable te&s;t of maiden innocence. Whenever a true vir|gin entered the cave, &s;ounds of the &s;weete&s;t melody proceeded from this in&s;trument; but if one who had lo&s;t her purity was ra&s;h enough to approach it, the pipe continued
<PB N="153" REF="154">
&s;ilent, and, in&s;tead of mu&s;ic, a groan of la|mentation was &s;ent forth from the cave.</P>
<P>Leucippe, the heroine of Tatius, being accu&s;ed of impurity, is brought to a&s;certain either her guilt or innocence by this awful experiment. She is &s;urrounded by &s;oli|citous &s;pectators: her malignant accu&s;er, her anxious father, and her lover, &s;uffering &s;till &s;tronger agitation&mdash;confident, indeed, in the virtue of his mi&s;tre&s;s, yet trembling le&s;t &s;he might &s;uffer from the wantonne&s;s of Pan. Thus attended, the virgin, with a meek and mode&s;t, yet intrepid dignity, de|&s;cends into the cave. What a group for the pencil! New pictures &s;ucceed.&mdash;The doors of the cave now clo&s;e upon her. What a moment of univer&s;al anxiety!&mdash; The pipe begins to &s;ound with peculiar &s;weetne&s;s&mdash;the doors unfold, and the virgin a&s;cends to honour and to love. What a &s;cene of triumph and ec&s;tacy for her father and her future hu&s;band!</P>
<P>In the &s;ame romance we have another trial of virgin purity, intitled, "The Trial of
<PB N="154" REF="155">
the Stygian Fountain." The ceremonial of it is thus de&s;cribed:&mdash;A maiden accu&s;ed of impurity &s;wears that the accu&s;ation is fal&s;e. Her oath is in&s;cribed on a &s;mall tablet, and, with this &s;u&s;pended to her neck, &s;he de&s;cends into the fountain. If &s;he has &s;worn fal&s;ely, the water begins to &s;well, and ri&s;es till, reaching her neck, it overwhelms the tablet; but, if &s;he is a genuine maid, the placid water continues below her knee, and the triumphant virgin, having remained her appointed time in the fountain, is led out of it by the applauding prie&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Achilles Tatius, lib. viii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the romance, which bears the name of the learned bi&s;hop Eu&s;tathius, a &s;imilar trial occurs. That amu&s;ing author de|&s;cribes a temple of Diana, in which was a golden &s;tatue of the Godde&s;s bending her bow; at her feet flowed a murmuring fountain, by which the cha&s;te Divinity u&s;ed to prove the innocence of her votaries. The &s;u&s;pected virgin was conducted into
<PB N="155" REF="156">
this my&s;terious water with a crown of laurel on her head. If &s;he was really pure, the Godde&s;s did not extend her bow, the water remained calm, and the maiden pa&s;&s;ed qui|etly through it, retaining her laurel crown on her head; but if (to copy the expre&s;&s;ion of Eu&s;tathius) the breath of Venus had ex|tingui&s;hed her virgin lamp, Diana directed her bow again&s;t the pretended virgin, and &s;eemed to aim at her head. The af|frighted culprit hid her&s;elf in the &s;tream to avoid the &s;haft, and her laurel wreath was wa&s;hed off by the murmuring water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;tathius de I&s;meniae et I&s;menes Amoribus, lib. viii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Incidents of this kind &s;eem to belong to romance; yet the learned editor of Eu&s;ta|thius, in a note to this &s;tory, has produced a &s;imilar anecdote from a grave hi&s;torian. He quotes a pa&s;&s;age from an unpubli&s;hed Greek chronicle of Con&s;tantinople, which informs us, that a &s;tatue of Venus in that city had this formidable attribute of di&s;co|vering the foibles of the fair: it a&s;certained
<PB N="156" REF="157">
the purity of married women and of virgins, both rich and poor; but at la&s;t, &s;ays the chronicle, the &s;i&s;ter of Ju&s;tin's wife de|&s;troyed the &s;tatue for having detected her frailty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;tathius Gaulmini, Notarum, p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The only remains of the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious and fanta&s;tic trials of virginity, that have de&s;cended to our more refined and enlight|ened age, appear in the common je&s;t of try|ing to rekindle by the breath an extingui&s;hed candle. Pa&s;quier, the learned French an|tiquarian, has written a chapter on this &s;portive cu&s;tom: he does not, indeed, at|tempt to di&s;cover its origin, but gravely takes occa&s;ion from the idea to a&s;&s;ert the de&s;picable emptine&s;s of all animal plea&s;ure, and to affirm, on the authority of Tertul|lian, that the happine&s;s of woman con&s;i&s;ts in her virginity <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;quier, Recherches, lib. viii. chap. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this mi&s;cellaneous chapter by acquainting the cha&s;te &s;i&s;terhood with many vain attempts that I have made to
<PB N="157" REF="158">
elucidate a very my&s;terious proverb, by which their whole order is prepo&s;terou&s;ly condemned to a very &s;trange and unworthy de&s;tiny; I mean the proverb, which &s;ays, that Old Maids are doomed
<Q>to lead apes in hell.</Q>
After con&s;ulting the pro|founde&s;t antiquarians of our own country, and &s;ome upon the continent, I am &s;till un|able to a&s;certain the origin of this remark|able &s;aying. One of my ingenious friends is convinced that it was invented by the Monks, to allure opulent females into the cloi&s;ter, by teaching them, that if they did not become the &s;pou&s;es either of man or God, they mu&s;t expect to be united, in a future world, to the mo&s;t impertinent and di&s;gu&s;ting companion. For my own part, I am inclined to rank an idea &s;o injurious to my fair friends among the di&s;mal and de&s;picable &s;uper&s;titions of Aegypt, as I find a pa&s;&s;age in Hermes Tri&s;megi&s;tus, which &s;ays, that tho&s;e who die childle&s;s are, im|mediately after their death, tormented by
<PB N="158" REF="159">
demons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tri&s;megi&s;ti lib. ix.</NOTE>. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, that from the very high re&s;pect which the Aegyptians entertained for the ape, the demons intended by Tri&s;megi&s;tus could hardly be of that figure. Indeed, the af|fectionate adoration which apes have &s;ome|times received, as we learn from the pious poet Prudentius <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Venerem precaris, comprecare et &s;imiam.
<BIBL>Prudentius.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, has at times led me to conjecture, that the &s;aying in que&s;tion might have ari&s;en in &s;ome country where it bore a very different meaning from what we annex to it at pre&s;ent; where this de&s;tiny of the ancient virgin was intended, not as the puni&s;hment, but the reward of her continence.</P>
<P>I do not recollect to have &s;een the expre&s;|&s;ion of <HI>leading apes</HI> in any Engli&s;h author before Shirley the dramatic poet. In his comedy, called The School of Compli|ment, printed in 1637, there is a &s;cene, in
<PB N="159" REF="160">
which, to humour the madne&s;s of Infor|tunio, the &s;everal characters on the &s;tage pretend to be damned. Delia, among the re&s;t, declares, that
<Q>&s;he was damned for being a &s;tale virgin, and that her pu|ni&s;hment was to <HI>lead apes in hell.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A living poet of our country &s;eems to have wi&s;hed to make the &s;i&s;terhood amends for the in&s;ult of this injurious proverb, by a&s;&s;igning a place to Old Maids in his poe|tical ely&s;ium. As the friend and advocate of the cha&s;te community, I tran&s;cribe with &s;ingular plea&s;ure the following ver&s;es, in which their neglected merits are &s;o libe|rally di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Containing the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a very delicate and important Que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>AS good fortune has thrown into my hands a manu&s;cript oration on a topic highly intere&s;ting to the &s;i&s;terhood, I &s;hall in&s;ert it in this chapter; and, to gra|tify, to the utmo&s;t of my power, the curio|&s;ity of my fair readers, I &s;hall introduce it by a little hi&s;tory of the incidents which have enabled me to enrich my work with &s;o &s;ingular an embelli&s;hment.</P>
<P>A few years ago I had the happine&s;s of ranking among my friends a gentleman of the mo&s;t amiable &s;ingularity. He was a baronet of an ancient family, and very am|ple po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in the North of England. His father, who had all the convivial &s;pirit &s;o prevalent in that part of our i&s;land, paid a very heavy tax for his bacchanalian en|joyments,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
in &s;uffering the frequent vi&s;its of an excruciating gout, and in dying at la&s;t a martyr of the bottle. My friend Sir Hi|lary Highman had all the natural vivacity of his father; he loved plea&s;ure as well, but, warned by &s;o &s;triking an example, he re|&s;olved to pur&s;ue it, though with equal ar|dour, yet in paths of le&s;s peril.</P>
<P>While his father was yet living, he di&s;co|vered in his own frame, young as it was, &s;ome traces of that formidable di&s;temper, to which parental intemperance had given him too good a title. This tendency he wi&s;ely determined to counteract, by a &s;teady adherence to the mo&s;t &s;imple diet. Yet, as he was unwilling to irritate the growing ill-humour of a parent, whom he tenderly regarded, he engaged not in this degenerate regimen, till he had taken leave of the jo|vial, te&s;ty, and crippled old gentleman, to embark in a favourite project of vi&s;iting the ruins of Greece. An oppo&s;ite conduct might have endangered his future fortune; as the impetuous old toper dete&s;ted the
<PB N="163" REF="164">
character of a milk&s;op, and would not, per|haps, have &s;crupled to di&s;inherit a &s;on, merely for renouncing that fe&s;tive poi&s;on, which had de&s;troyed his own temper, and was rapidly preying on the dregs of his ex|hau&s;ted life. My friend, indeed, when he &s;et out on his travels, relying on the &s;trength of his father's con&s;titution, enter|tained a very lively hope of amu&s;ing the old knight, on his return, with a hi&s;tory of his adventures. But the fates deter|mined otherwi&s;e. A long &s;cene of election fe&s;tivity hurried this hearty friend of Bac|chus to the grave; and the temperate Sir Hilary was recalled from the ruins of Athens, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate large enough to furni&s;h every kind of luxury to an attic imagination. Ab&s;temious as he was, Sir Hilary was a genuine di&s;ciple of Epicurus; he con&s;idered plea&s;ure as the univer&s;al aim of every &s;en&s;ible being; but the plea&s;ure he courted was only &s;uch as ari&s;es from the indulgence of an elegant fancy and a benevolent heart. He was
<PB N="164" REF="165">
particularly fond of female &s;ociety; and his pa&s;&s;ions were vehement, though tender; a Grecian lady, of exqui&s;ite beauty and ac|compli&s;hments, inflamed them to the high|e&s;t degree, and he had been privately mar|ried to her many months, when the intelli|gence arrived which recalled him to his country. The delights ari&s;ing from his new connection, and the general &s;tate of his father's ruined health and temper, allowed him not to feel any great poignancy or grief, though he frequently &s;poke of the de|parted old gentleman with a grateful and tender regret. Sir Hilary was far from &s;hewing any eagerne&s;s to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the princely opulence which had now de|volved to him. His affectionate attention to his lovely Greek, rendered his travels homeward particularly &s;low. This fair part|ner of his fortune was advanced in preg|nancy. Her hu&s;band would have kindly waited the event on the coa&s;t of A&s;ia Mi|nor, of which &s;he was a native; but it was &s;ettled, at the reque&s;t of the lady, that they
<PB N="165" REF="166">
&s;hould proceed on their way to England as far as Rome, where &s;he had the happine&s;s of pre&s;enting to Sir Hilary two lovely boys, not inferior to the twin founders of the im|perial city. The exulting mother &s;oon re|covered her &s;trength with increa&s;ing loveli|ne&s;s; and the whole party arrived, with chequered &s;en&s;ations of joy and &s;orrow, at the paternal &s;eat of Sir Hilary. The young baronet paid all decent honours to the me|mory of his father, and hand&s;omely provid|ed for a few old dome&s;tics, who had &s;hared both the joviality and the infirmities of their late ma&s;ter. He &s;oon began to new-model his hou&s;e, and to regulate his e&s;tabli&s;hment. In both it was his chief aim to unite ele|gance with comfort, and gaiety with tem|perance. He built a very &s;pacious library, with an adjoining &s;aloon; the latter was well furni&s;hed with a few admirable pic|tures, and the former completely enriched with books, bu&s;ts, and &s;tatues. Sir Hilary had imbibed very early an extreme pa&s;&s;ion for Grecian literature, which the incidents
<PB N="166" REF="167">
of his life had tended to increa&s;e. He parti|cularly admired that ca&s;t of conver&s;ation which u&s;ed to form the mo&s;t delightful part of an ancient attic entertainment, and he often wi&s;hed to &s;ub&s;titute &s;omething of this nature in the room of tho&s;e dull or di&s;gu&s;t|ing topics of di&s;cour&s;e, which produce &s;uch a heavy effect in the rural vi&s;its of our Engli&s;h gentry. He was a hearty friend to every harmle&s;s, &s;ocial plea&s;ure; but he wi&s;hed to give a little tincture of literary refine|ment to his convivial neighbourhood. This was no ea&s;y ta&s;k; yet Sir Hilary accom|pli&s;hed it: and indeed there is hardly any enterprize too hard for a man, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, as he did, engaging manners with warm philanthropy, and a very abundant portion of opulence and wit. Events, how|ever, happened luckily to facilitate his de|&s;ign. On his exten&s;ive e&s;tate there were two livings of con&s;iderable value; they had been occupied by two orthodox topers, pro|moted by the old baronet for their uniform adherence to the bottle. The&s;e hone&s;t di|vines
<PB N="167" REF="168">
had drank &s;o deeply together to the memory of the good old knight, that they &s;oon fini&s;hed their la&s;t bumper on earth, and &s;lept in peace with their patron. Sir Hilary &s;eized, with great plea&s;ure, this op|portunity of &s;ettling in his neighbourhood two gentlemen who&s;e habits of life were congenial with his own. He was happy in be&s;towing ea&s;e and independence on two liberal men, with whom he had contracted an intimacy at college, and who had been the a&s;&s;ociates of his early &s;tudies. They were per&s;ons of equal integrity, but of dif|ferent characters. Literature was the pa&s;|&s;ion of each; but the fir&s;t valued learning only as it led him to the &s;erious practice of virtue; the &s;econd loved it as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing exerci&s;e of an active and playful &s;pirit. Oppo&s;ite as they were in their di&s;|po&s;itions, they had a perfect e&s;teem for each other, and for the amiable patron, who con|&s;idered their &s;ociety as one of the highe&s;t gratifications that propitious fortune had be&s;towed upon him. The&s;e clerical friends
<PB N="168" REF="169">
were both in the prime of life; and, as they were both unmarried, they were particu|larly care&s;&s;ed by the families around them. By the aid of the&s;e gentlemen, with a third clergyman, who re&s;ided under his roof as a dome&s;tic chaplain, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the education of his children, Sir Hilary com|menced an in&s;titution, which contributed not a little to the amu&s;ement of him&s;elf and his acquaintance. At the full of every moon, it was his cu&s;tom to give a very elegant en|tertainment to the gentry of his neighbour|hood. On the&s;e days, in the interval be|tween tea and &s;upper, orations were read or &s;poken in the &s;pacious library, on a &s;ubject propo&s;ed at the preceding a&s;&s;embly. It was the banquet of Plato, an author in whom Sir Hilary delighted, that fir&s;t in&s;pired him with this idea: and in the&s;e Engli&s;h dia|logues the moral &s;pirit of that &s;ublime Grecian was &s;ometimes very happily co|pied, without any mixture of the gro&s;s inde|cency, with which the mo&s;t engaging of his productions is mi&s;erably di&s;graced.
<PB N="169" REF="170">
Sir Hilary did not confine his entertainment to pro&s;aic di&s;cour&s;es; but profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf equally obliged to tho&s;e gue&s;ts, who pro|duced either a pro&s;e di&s;&s;ertation, or a poeti|cal <HI>jeu d'e&s;prit</HI> on the topic of the day. The ver&s;es were depo&s;ited on a large li|brary table, and u&s;ually read by Sir Hi|lary's &s;ecretary, who acted as clerk to the a&s;&s;embly, before the orations began; which were generally delivered by their re&s;pective authors, and &s;ometimes without any pre|meditation. Extempore ver&s;es, compo&s;ed upon the &s;pot, were al&s;o kindly received; and if thrown on the table while the a&s;&s;em|bly was &s;itting, they were read by the clerk, when the orations were clo&s;ed, as a kind of epilogue to the amu&s;ements of the day.</P>
<P>I happened to meet my old acquaintance Sir Hilary in London, at a time when I was greatly reduced by a &s;evere and lingering illne&s;s. He kindly in&s;i&s;ted on my pa&s;&s;ing a few weeks with him at his country &s;eat, in the friendly hope of contributing to the re|covery of my health, affirming, with his
<PB N="170" REF="171">
u&s;ual plea&s;antry, that one of his attic ban|quets would prove to me a nervous cordial; and conduce, more than the mo&s;t fa&s;hion|able medicines, to the revival of a literary invalid. My friend's in&s;titution was now indeed in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate. Sir Hi|lary had, by degrees, diffu&s;ed around his neighbourhood a &s;pirit of amicable and ele|gant emulation. He had particularly ca|re&s;&s;ed and animated the young people in the genteel families around him, and in the cour&s;e of a few years he had formed, in his a&s;&s;embly, a little band of orators, whom Athens her&s;elf might have li&s;tened to with plea&s;ure. The ladies, though they never &s;o far forgot the delicacy of their &s;ex as to declaim in the&s;e meetings, yet contributed not a little to the general amu&s;ement, by various compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I wi&s;hed in vain for powers to take an active part in the plea&s;ing cere|mony of the place; but my health was &s;till &s;o weak, that I dared not venture on any kind of mental exertion. I had, however,
<PB N="171" REF="172">
before this period, conceived the fir&s;t idea of my pre&s;ent work, and, wi&s;hing to derive all the advantages I could from this accom|pli&s;hed &s;ociety, I reque&s;ted my friend Sir Hilary to propo&s;e the following que&s;tion as a &s;ubject of debate in one of his a&s;&s;emblies: &mdash;
<Q>Which is the more eligible for a wife, a Widow, or an Old Maid?</Q>
&mdash;My lively friend very chearfully acquie&s;ced in my pro|po&s;al; and the topic gave birth to much innocent plea&s;antry, and to &s;ome &s;erious ar|gument. I heartily wi&s;h it were in my power to enrich the&s;e volumes with many of the pieces, both in pro&s;e and rhyme, that were produced on this occa&s;ion; but all that I was allowed to trea&s;ure up, amounts only to three epigrams, and a &s;ingle oration. It is, however, the very oration that I was mo&s;t &s;olicitous to obtain; for, alas! with grief I confe&s;s, that although &s;even orators ha|rangued upon the que&s;tion, one alone had genero&s;ity enough to argue on the &s;ide of the neglected &s;i&s;terhood; with what powers of rhetoric, my reader will very &s;oon have
<PB N="172" REF="173">
the opportunity of judging. I &s;hall fir&s;t produce the poetical <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit.</HI> The fir&s;t of the three following epigrams was found, with other pieces of poetry, on the library table, and were recited, according to the ceremonial I have mentioned, before the orations began; the others were literally produced extempore, and of cour&s;e were not read till the &s;peeches were clo&s;ed; but as they aro&s;e from the preceding epigram, I &s;hall here in&s;ert them united.</P>

<P>There were other ver&s;es recited, of a more &s;erious ca&s;t. Some juvenile bards wandered a little from the &s;ubject; and a young Oxonian forgot the re&s;pect due to both parties concerned in the que&s;tion; for, in&s;tead of deciding the point in debate, he &s;atirized both the Widow and the Old Maid with much &s;arca&s;tic wit, and con|cluded with a mo&s;t animated panegyric on a blooming girl of eighteen.</P>
<P>More than one poet, however, pleaded the cau&s;e of the Widow with energy and pa|thos; but the frail nymphs of Parna&s;&s;us were &s;o unfriendly to the claims of the el|derly virgin &s;i&s;terhood, that no bard ap|peared to &s;ing decidedly in favour of the poor Old Maid: nor will this circum|&s;tance be thought &s;urpri&s;ing, when we re|collect,
<PB N="175" REF="176">
that among the orators (a more rea|&s;onable &s;et of men than the &s;portive &s;ons of Apollo) the Old Maiden found only a &s;ingle advocate. Of the &s;ix &s;peakers who argued with vehemence for the Widow, the mo&s;t amu&s;ing was a lively and hone&s;t fox-hunter, not remarkable for erudition, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong mental powers in a robu&s;t con&s;ti|tution, and happy in a rich vein of original humour. This gentleman was actually in chace of a young, opulent, and lovely Wi|dow. He gloried in this pur&s;uit, and, being animated with the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;poke with peculiar force and felicity on the topic of the day. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that he &s;ometimes threw the au|dience into a kind of panic, by appearing to gallop very fa&s;t towards the precipice of indecency; but whenever he found him|&s;elf on the brink of it, he rapidly made &s;o delicate and dexterous a turn, that he con|verted the terrors of the company into ea&s;e, admiration, and good-humour.</P>
<P>The debate on this &s;ide of the que&s;tion
<PB N="176" REF="177">
was clo&s;ed by a &s;peaker of an oppo&s;ite cha|racter. He was a gentleman of exten&s;ive learning and a grave deportment, yet ea&s;y in his addre&s;s and forcible in his elocution. He gave us a &s;erious yet entertaining hi&s;|tory of widowhood, and enumerated the happy events, and the illu&s;trious characters, to which the &s;econd marriage of &s;ome emi|nent Widows had given birth. When his peroration was ended, which, being tender and pathetic, formed a plea&s;ing contra&s;t to the humorous arguments of his prede|ce&s;&s;or, a gentleman aro&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with a very graceful per&s;on, an uncommon archne&s;s of countenance; and in a voice pe|culiarly melodious, he delivered the fol|lowing oration:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Pre&s;ident,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Though I was aware that a very for|midable majority of &s;peakers would ap|pear again&s;t me, it is yet with confidence that I engage on the unpopular &s;ide of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion; a que&s;tion upon
<PB N="177" REF="178">
which the prejudices, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the practice of mankind, are in direct oppo&s;ition to the cleare&s;t dictates of rea|&s;on and of ju&s;tice! Yes! Sir, I will be &s;o bold as to affirm, that if the conduct and the opinions of men were under the &s;teady guidance of equity, this que&s;tion could not remain doubtful for a &s;ingle minute, in the mind of any man; it mu&s;t be decided, without a moment's he&s;ita|tion, in favour of that injured, that de|rided being, the involuntary Old Maid, who&s;e advocate I profe&s;s my&s;elf: nor would &s;uch a deci&s;ion depend on any prior &s;entiments, which the arbiter might form, to the di&s;credit, or to the glory, of wedlock; for, whether we con&s;ider mar|riage as a burthen or as an enjoyment, it is equally unju&s;t that any female &s;hould twice &s;uffer that burthen, or be twice indulged in that enjoyment, while an|other, at the &s;ame period of life, is kept an utter &s;tranger to the cares or to the delights of an important office, which
<PB N="178" REF="179">
&s;he is equally ready to a&s;&s;ume, and equally able to &s;upport. This po&s;ition is, I tru&s;t, &s;o evident, that, if I could convert this a&s;&s;embly into the &s;upreme court of judicature, and bring to its bar both the Widow and the Old Maid, as rival claimants of the nuptial coronet, on the mere principles of right, I am per|&s;uaded the integrity of this audience would &s;oon terminate the conte&s;t, and ratify the title of my client by an unani|mous decree. But alas! in this point there is no tribunal on earth, to which the di&s;con&s;olate Old Maiden can &s;ucce&s;s|fully apply for &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice. The clamour of prejudice is again&s;t her, and her preten&s;ions are derided; while cu&s;tom and commodity,
<Q>That &s;mooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling com|modity,</Q>
are &s;uch active and pro&s;perous agents for her antagoni&s;t, the Widow, that &s;he, this in&s;idious antagoni&s;t! is admitted,
<PB N="179" REF="180">
perhaps, three, four, or even five times to the recent altar of Hymen, while my unfortunate client, the neglected Old Maid, however wi&s;hfully &s;he may look towards the portal, is not allowed to find even a temporary &s;helter within a por|tico of the temple.&mdash;Can this, Sir, be called equity? Is it not inju&s;tice? Is it not barbarity?&mdash;But I may be told, that in the common occurrences of life, in a tran&s;|action &s;uch as marriage, peculiarly &s;ubject to fancy and caprice, we mu&s;t not expect, we mu&s;t not require men to ob&s;erve the nicer dictates of &s;trict equity, and a &s;pe|culative rule of right.&mdash;Be it &s;o!&mdash;I will not, therefore, on this important que&s;tion, appeal &s;olely to the con&s;ciences of men; I will appeal to their intere&s;ts. I will prove to them, that he who marries an Old Maid, has a much greater chance of being invariably beloved by his wife, or, in other words, of being happy in wed|lock, than he has, who ra&s;hly throws him&s;elf into the open arms of a Widow.
<PB N="180" REF="181">
&mdash;Sir, I flatter my&s;elf, it will require no long chain of arguments to e&s;tabli&s;h and fortify, on the mo&s;t &s;olid ground, this momentous po&s;ition. I tru&s;t, that I &s;hall be able to accompli&s;h it, merely by re|minding this audience of a propen&s;ity in the human mind, which cannot be called in que&s;tion; I mean the propen&s;ity to exalt in our e&s;timation tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of which we are deprived, and to &s;ink the value of what is actually in our hands.&mdash;Sir, the fir&s;t part of this pro|pen&s;ity is &s;o general, and it operates with &s;uch amazing force on the character to whom I wi&s;h to apply it, that I remem|ber the admirable Fielding, with a mo&s;t happy coincidence of humour and of truth, calls the death of an hu&s;band 'an infallible recipe to recover the lo&s;t af|fections of a wife.'</P>
<P>Let me, Sir, entreat this a&s;&s;embly to retain in their thoughts the propen&s;ity I have mentioned, and then to contemplate with me the feelings of the late Widow
<PB N="181" REF="182">
towards her &s;econd or third hu&s;band, and the feelings of the quondam Old Maid, now joyfully united to her fir&s;t and only love.&mdash;Sir, the affection of the re-married Widow is a pocket tele&s;cope; &s;he directs the magnifying end of it towards her good man in the grave, and it enlarges to a marvellous degree all the mental and all the per&s;onal endowments of the dear departed. She then turns the in|verted gla&s;s to his dimini&s;hing &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and, whatever his proportion of excel|lence may be, the poor luckle&s;s living mortal &s;oon dwindles in her &s;ight to a comparative pigmy. But, Sir, this is not the ca&s;e with our quondam Old Maid. No! Sir&mdash;her affection is a porta|ble micro&s;cope, which magnifies in a &s;tu|pendous manner all the attractive merits and powers of plea&s;ing, however incon|&s;iderable they may be, in the favourite creature upon whom &s;he gazes. Like an inexperienced but a pa&s;&s;ionate natura|li&s;t, &s;he continues to &s;urvey the new and
<PB N="182" REF="183">
&s;ole object of her contemplation, not only with unremitted a&s;&s;iduity, but with increa&s;ing amazement and delight. He fills her eye; he occupies her mind; he engro&s;&s;es her heart.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid in reply, If the man who marries an Old Maid has this &s;uperior chance of being uniformly be|loved by his wife, &s;ince it is certainly the wi&s;h of every man who marries to be &s;o, how happens it that men decide &s;o pre|po&s;terou&s;ly again&s;t them&s;elves, and per|petually prefer the Widow to the Old Maid? Is not this con&s;tant preference a very &s;trong argument in favour of the character &s;o preferred? Does it not prove, that the Widow has acquired the art, or the power, of conferring more happine&s;s on her &s;econd hu&s;band than the Old Maid is able to be&s;tow upon her fir&s;t? for can we &s;uppo&s;e that men, in|&s;tructed by the experience of ages, would continue to act in con&s;tant oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="183" REF="184">
their own dome&s;tic happine&s;s, in the mo&s;t important article of human life?</P>
<P>Alas! Sir, I fear there are more arti|cles than one, in which we incon&s;iderate mortals may be frequently ob&s;erved to act again&s;t experience, again&s;t our rea|&s;on, and again&s;t our felicity. That the Widow is con&s;tantly preferred to the Old Maid, I mo&s;t readily admit; nay, I complain of it as an inveterate grievance; but I tru&s;t, Sir, that I can account for this unrea&s;onable preference, without adding a &s;ingle grain to the weight, or rather to the empty &s;cale, of the Widow.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, a very &s;imple meta|phor will illu&s;trate the whole affair on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The Widow is an experienced and a &s;kilful angler, who has acquired patience to wait for the favourable minute, and rapidity to &s;trike in the very in&s;tant when the fi&s;h has fairly ri&s;en to the hook. By this double excellence her &s;ucce&s;s is en&s;ured. But alas! Sir, the Old Maid
<PB N="184" REF="185">
is an angler, whom fruitle&s;s expectation has rendered both impatient and un&s;kil|ful; &s;he is thrown into trepidation by the fir&s;t appearance of <HI>a nibble,</HI> and by making a too ha&s;ty movement at that critical juncture, &s;he too often renders her bait, however &s;weet it may be, an object of terror, in&s;tead of allurement, to what &s;he wi&s;hes to catch. Though my allu&s;ion may &s;ound a little coar&s;ely, let me entreat you, Sir, not to imagine that I mean to expre&s;s any degree of di&s;|re&s;pect to my hone&s;t and worthy client, the unpro&s;perous Old Maid. Allow me, Sir, to remind you, that ingenuous and unhacknied &s;pirits, though actively in|clined, are often reduced to do nothing, by their too eager de&s;ire to do well; and this is frequently the ca&s;e of the good and delicate Old Maid, in her laudable project of &s;ecuring a hu&s;band: &s;o that even when &s;he is her&s;elf the cau&s;e of her own failure in this worthy purpo&s;e, &s;he de&s;erves not our cen&s;ure but our
<PB N="185" REF="186">
compa&s;&s;ion. Yes! Sir, the partizans of the Widow may &s;mile, if they plea&s;e, at my a&s;&s;ertion; but I &s;cruple not to af|firm, that the &s;olitary, neglected Old Maid is more truly entitled to pity, that &s;oft harbinger of love, than the weeping Widow her&s;elf. Much has been &s;aid, and, I confe&s;s, with great eloquence, on the Widow's attractive &s;orrow. It is, in|deed, <HI>attractive</HI>; and &s;o attractive, that it has frequently recalled to my imagi|nation the moan of the hyaena, that art|ful, de&s;tructive, and in&s;atiable creature, who is &s;aid by the ancient naturali&s;ts to lure into her den, by a treacherous cry of di&s;tre&s;s, the unwary traveller whom &s;he intends to devour. This in&s;idious behaviour of the hyaena is a que&s;tionable fact, that no one, perhaps, can fully prove or refute; but all per&s;ons of any experience in the world have &s;een in|&s;tances of men, who have been allured into the &s;nare of the Widow, and have lamented, when it was too late to re|treat,
<PB N="186" REF="187">
that they fell the victims of their own generous, but mi&s;placed compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The habit of changing is very apt to produce a pa&s;&s;ion for novelty; and the wife, who has buried one or two hu&s;|bands, on a &s;light di&s;agreement with her &s;econd or third, will &s;oon wi&s;h him to &s;leep in peace with his departed prede|ce&s;&s;or, from her hope of being more lucky in her next adventure. You may remember, Sir, that our old poet Chau|cer, that admirable and exact painter of life and manners! has very happily marked this prevalent di&s;po&s;ition of the re-married Widow, in the long prologue which he a&s;&s;igns to his Wife of Bath. That good lady glories in having al|ready buried four hu&s;bands, and expre&s;&s;es a perfect readine&s;s, whenever Heaven may give her the opportunity, to engage with a &s;ixth. Let it not be &s;aid, that this character is a mere phantom, created by the lively imagination of a &s;atirical and facetious poet! No! Sir, this venerable,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
though &s;portive old bard, copied na|ture mo&s;t faithfully: and, as a proof that he did &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I will mention a more marvellous example of this pa&s;&s;ion in the re-marrying Widow for an unlimited &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of novelties. Sir, the example I mean, is recorded in an eccle&s;ia&s;tical writer of great authority, who&s;e name I cannot in this moment re|collect; but I remember he mentions it as a fact, which happened at Rome, and to which he was him&s;elf an eye-witne&s;s. This fact, Sir, was the marriage of a widow to her <HI>twenty-&s;econd hu&s;band.</HI> The man al&s;o had buried <HI>twenty wives</HI>; and all the eyes of Rome were fixed on this &s;ingular pair, as on a couple of gladiators, anxious to &s;ee which would conduct the other to the grave. If I remember right, the woman, after all her funeral triumphs, was the victim in this wonder|ful conflict: but the &s;tory, however it might terminate, &s;ufficiently proves the pa&s;&s;ion for novelty, which I have a&s;cribed
<PB N="188" REF="189">
to the Widow. Now, Sir, if the &s;econd or third hu&s;band of a Widow may have frequent cau&s;e to imagine, that his lady's transferrable affections are veering to|ward his probable &s;ucce&s;&s;or, he cannot &s;urely be &s;o happy, or &s;ecure, as the man who has more wi&s;ely united him&s;elf to a worthy Old Maid. She, good &s;oul! re|membering how long &s;he waited for her fir&s;t hu&s;band, in&s;tead of ha&s;tily looking forward to a &s;econd, will direct all her at|tention to cheri&s;h and pre&s;erve the dear creature, whom &s;he at la&s;t acquired after tedious expectation. Her good man has no rival to fear, either among the living or the dead, and may &s;ecurely enjoy the delightful prerogative of believing him|&s;elf the ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of his wife's af|fections. I entreat you, Sir, to ob&s;erve how very different the ca&s;e is with the in|con&s;iderate man, who ra&s;hly married a Widow! He has not only to apprehend, that the changeable tenderne&s;s of his lady may take a &s;udden turn towards his
<PB N="189" REF="190">
probable &s;ucce&s;&s;or, but, if her thoughts are too faithful, and too virtuous, to wan|der towards the living, even then, Sir, after all his endeavours to take full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, though he may de|lude him&s;elf with the vain idea of being its &s;ole proprietor, he will frequently find, that he has only entered into partner&s;hip with a gho&s;t. Yes! Sir, though my op|ponents may treat the expre&s;&s;ion as ludi|crous, I will maintain that it is literally ju&s;t. I repeat, he has entered into part|ner&s;hip with a gho&s;t, and I will add, Sir, the very probable con&s;equence of &s;uch a partner&s;hip; he will &s;oon find, that by the &s;ubtle illu&s;ions of his invi&s;ible partner, he has lo&s;t even his poor moiety in that precarious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the heart of a re|married Widow! and will find him&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, a real bankrupt in happi|ne&s;s. Since my antagoni&s;ts have been plea&s;ed to &s;mile at my expre&s;&s;ion, as the language rather of fancy than of truth, &s;uffer me, Mr. Pre&s;ident, to quote a ca&s;e,
<PB N="190" REF="191">
in which this dead, this derided partner made his actual appearance, and was bold enough to urge an exclu&s;ive claim. Sir, I tru&s;t the ca&s;e I allude to is a ca&s;e di|rectly in point; it is quoted, indeed, on a different occa&s;ion, by the admirable Addi&s;on, from the &s;eventeenth book of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian, Jo&s;ephus. I mean the ca&s;e of the Widow Glaphyra, who, having been twice a Widow, took for her third hu&s;band Archelaus. You may remember, Sir, that the thoughts of this lady, after her third adventure, ran &s;o much on her fir&s;t lord, that &s;he &s;aw the good man in a vi&s;ion&mdash;'Glaphyra,' &s;aid the phantom, 'thou ha&s;t made good the old &s;aying, that women are not to be tru&s;ted. Was not I the hu&s;band of thy virginity? Have I not children by thee? How could&s;t thou forget our loves &s;o far, as to enter into a &s;econd marriage, and after that into a third? &mdash; But for our pa&s;&s;ed loves I will free thee from thy pre|&s;ent reproach, and make thee mine for
<PB N="191" REF="192">
ever.'&mdash;Glaphyra related her dream, and died &s;oon after. This, Sir, is a &s;erious and tragical proof, how dangerous it is to marry a Widow. Surely no con&s;iderate man would chu&s;e to incur the hazard of having his bride thus torn from his em|braces by &s;o arrogant a phantom.&mdash;Al|low me, Sir, to relate a &s;tory of a comic ca&s;t, which will equally prove the &s;ecret perils of &s;uch a marriage. I received it from a very worthy old gentleman, not unknown to this a&s;&s;embly. He was ac|quainted, in his youth, with a famous mimic of the la&s;t century, who was the principal actor in this comic or rather farcical &s;cene, and related it circum&s;tan|tially to my friend. This mimic, Sir, a man of plea&s;antry and adventure, court|ed, in the early part of his life, a very hand&s;ome and opulent Widow; &s;he gave him the highe&s;t encouragement; but, as avarice was her foible, &s;he at la&s;t jilted him for a wealthy &s;uitor, who, though of a very timid con&s;titution, was ra&s;h
<PB N="192" REF="193">
enough to marry this very tempting Wi|dow. The di&s;carded mimic was inflamed with a variety of pa&s;&s;ions, and determined to take &s;ome very &s;ignal revenge. An opportunity of vengeance occurred to him, which, as he knew the extreme ti|midity of his fortunate rival, he &s;eized without the pau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion. His valet had intrigued with the favourite abigail of the Widow, and by her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance the mimic commanded the nuptial chamber of the bride. He had known the per&s;on of her fir&s;t hu&s;band, and, hav|ing concealed him&s;elf under a toilet, till the hour of con&s;ummation, he then made his appearance, a&s;&s;uming the mo&s;t exact &s;imilitude, both in figure and voice, to the dear departed. He had hardly un|drawn the curtain, when the affrighted bride fell into a fit. The bridegroom, who had al&s;o known his decea&s;ed prede|ce&s;&s;or, was &s;eized with a panic &s;till wor&s;e, and his trembling body &s;oon diffu&s;ed &s;o powerful an effluvia, that although it
<PB N="193" REF="194">
contributed nothing to his own relief, it recovered the lady from her &s;woon. She revived in perfect po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;en&s;es, and, finding the dead hu&s;band vani&s;hed, and the living one unfit for a companion, &s;he ha&s;tily aro&s;e. As &s;he loved money, &s;he had taken the prudent precaution of &s;ecuring to her&s;elf the en|joyment of her own fortune, and, having &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the trick which had been played again&s;t her, &s;he re&s;olved to make a wi&s;e u&s;e of it, and declared, that &s;he would never proceed to con&s;um|mate her marriage with a man, who had not re&s;olution enough to protect her from a gho&s;t. She per&s;i&s;ted in this con|duct, and the luckle&s;s derided bride|groom remained, through life, a melan|choly example to confirm the wi&s;dom of that adage, which &s;ays, that he &s;hould, indeed, be a bold man, who enters into the &s;ervice of a Widow.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hould entreat your pardon for
<PB N="194" REF="195">
having tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on the patience of this a&s;&s;embly by the recital of &s;o long a &s;tory, did I not flatter my&s;elf that it will have a happy tendency to guard the &s;ingle gentlemen, who hear me, from the ini|quitous temerity of preferring a Widow to an Old Maid.</P>
<P>I might alledge, Sir, many arguments which I have not hitherto touched upon, in favour of my client. I might &s;hew of what infinite importance it is to ma|trimonial felicity, that the hu&s;band &s;hould receive into his arms a partner for life, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition and habits, in|&s;tead of being fixed already by a former lord, are yet to be moulded according to the will and abilities of her fir&s;t and only director. Sir, in this point, the Widow is a piece of warped wood, which the mo&s;t &s;kilful workman may find him|&s;elf unable to &s;hape as he wi&s;hes; but the Old Maid, Sir, is the pliant virgin wax, which follows, with the mo&s;t happy
<PB N="195" REF="196">
ductility, every &s;erious de&s;ign, every in|genious device, every &s;portive whim, of the modeller.</P>
<P>But I will relinqui&s;h the innumerable arguments that I might yet adduce in &s;upport of the Old Maid; I will re&s;t her cau&s;e on that &s;olid rock, which I have endeavoured, Sir, to exhibit in different points of view, I mean the &s;uperior &s;e|curity with which her hu&s;band may de|pend on the &s;tability of her affection. I will conclude by conjuring every gentle|man, who may happen to he&s;itate be|tween a Widow and an Old Maid, to remember, that rea&s;on and experience, that equity and the general intere&s;t of mankind, all loudly plead for his pre|ferring the latter: I will conjure him to recollect, that the man who marries a Widow has great cau&s;e to apprehend un|rea&s;onable expectations, unplea&s;ant com|pari&s;ons, and variable affection; while he, who marries an Old Maid, may with confidence prepare to meet unexacting
<PB N="196" REF="197">
tenderne&s;s, increa&s;ing gratitude, and per|petual endearments.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t &s;anguine projector that ever wa&s;ted his fortune and his brains in the &s;moke of expectation, never thought on the golden crown of all his la|bours with more a&s;&s;iduity and hope, than I have thought on the amu&s;ement and advan|tage, which, I tru&s;t, will accrue to the com|munity of Old Maids from this elaborate E&s;&s;ay. The good &s;pin&s;ters have frequently engro&s;&s;ed me &s;leeping as well as waking. In proof of this affectionate a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall clo&s;e my work with a circum&s;tantial account of a very &s;ingular vi&s;ion, which my extreme &s;olicitude for their intere&s;t mo&s;t certainly produced.</P>
<P>I had been reading, in a hot &s;ummer's
<PB N="199" REF="200">
day, a little too &s;oon after dinner, one of the Greek homilies on virginity; when my at|tention gradually dimini&s;hed, and &s;leep im|perceptibly &s;tole upon me. I found my|&s;elf tran&s;ported on a &s;udden from my own narrow &s;tudy, and a little circle of dingy folios, to the middle of a large and magni|ficent apartment. It appeared to be the refectory of a very populous convent: at the upper end of it were two doors; the one, which &s;tood open, di&s;covered to me a very elegant and exten&s;ive chapel; the other, as I found in the &s;equel, led into a &s;et of apartments appropriated to the lady abbe&s;s of this cha&s;te but unfettered &s;ociety. I was &s;oon informed, by a group of cour|teous females, who were walking for the purpo&s;es of exerci&s;e and conver&s;ation in this &s;pacious hall, that the ample and &s;ump|tuous fabric had been rai&s;ed by the contri|bution of many elderly virgins, all of libe|ral birth and education, though unequal in their fortunes, who, forming them&s;elves into a very numerous yet friendly commu|nity,
<PB N="200" REF="201">
dwell together with quiet indu&s;try and &s;ocial content.</P>
<P>"We are governed," &s;aid a kind and communicative &s;i&s;ter of the hou&s;e (who, with a di&s;po&s;ition that appeared to me pe|culiarly angelical in an ancient virgin, ex|pre&s;&s;ed more eagerne&s;s to &s;atisfy my curio|&s;ity than her own)
<Q>we are governed by a pre&s;ident of our own &s;ex, who is annually elected by a majority of our &s;i&s;terhood; but though we formally exert the privi|lege of election, we have never had but one and the &s;ame governe&s;s; for the lady who fir&s;t planned, and has &s;ince di|rected, our &s;ociety, is con&s;tantly recho&s;en into the delicate and important office, which &s;he di&s;charges to the &s;atisfaction of all with whom &s;he is connected.</Q>
"How, madam," I exclaimed,
<Q>how may I obtain the happine&s;s of beholding a per&s;onage &s;o extraordinary?</Q>
<Q>You will probably behold her very &s;oon,</Q>
replied my kind informer,
<Q>returning into this &s;a|loon from our adjoining chapel. You
<PB N="201" REF="202">
may di&s;tingui&s;h,</Q>
&s;he continued,
<Q>thro' that open door, a di&s;tant party engaged about the altar; among them you may ju&s;t di&s;cern our pre&s;ident Seraphina, with her two favourite a&s;&s;i&s;tants, Mele|&s;inda and Fu&s;cina. They are employed in a melancholy yet plea&s;ing office, in decorating the tomb of an amiable old divine, who formed a part of our hou&s;e|hold, and was, indeed, to have appeared in the character of our pa&s;tor; but as, from motives of maidenly di&s;cretion, we cho&s;e the good man in a very advanced and infirm period of life, he has never been able to a&s;cend the pulpit prepared for him. We were afraid of wounding both him and our&s;elves, by appointing any &s;ub&s;titute for him, while we could hope for his recovery, and have there|fore &s;ub&s;i&s;ted hitherto without any acting mini&s;ter, except one &s;elected from our|&s;elves, for the mere purpo&s;e of reading the chapel &s;ervice of the day; for we are very punctual in our daily devotions; and,
<PB N="202" REF="203">
now the good old man is departed, our pre&s;ident will probably &s;oon chu&s;e for us a preacher, who may fill more effectually the department of the decea&s;ed.</Q>
My pul&s;e quickened as &s;he &s;poke; but the mingled &s;entiments of &s;urpri&s;e, joy, and ambition, rendered me unable to frame an immediate reply. Never did the hot peri|cranium of any dean or provo&s;t &s;o itch and burn for an expected mitre, as mine did at this moment for a certain &s;quare cap of white velvet, adorned with a &s;ilver ta&s;&s;el, which now glittered in my view. It was &s;u&s;pended to the wall of the &s;aloon, at the centre of the dining-table; and my good-natured informer, who ob&s;erved with what an inquiring eye I &s;urveyed it, very kindly told me, it was the work of their fair pre&s;i|dent, prepared as a mark of affectionate di&s;tinction for the pa&s;tor of this maiden flock. While this &s;hining object of my cha&s;te ambition &s;till attracted my eyes, and I was &s;till li&s;tening to &s;everal intere&s;ting little anecdotes concerning it, the lady ab|be&s;s
<PB N="203" REF="204">
and her attendants began to move to|wards me. My heart fluttered as they ad|vanced. Though a con&s;iderable &s;pace was yet between us, I was &s;truck with a trem|bling and &s;peechle&s;s awe, by the air of com|placent grandeur which appeared in the form and countenance of Seraphina. Ne|ver did a young volunteer, pre&s;ented for the fir&s;t time to the imperial Catherine of Ru&s;&s;ia, feel a more ardent, unutterable de|&s;ire to &s;erve his fair &s;overeign in the field or the cabinet, than I felt to recommend my|&s;elf to the very different favours of this dignified lady. But how is it po&s;&s;ible, thought I to my&s;elf, as &s;he was approach|ing, to make her &s;uddenly my patrone&s;s? Her character, and all her features, a&s;&s;ure me, that &s;he is utterly devoid of ambition and de&s;ire, tho&s;e quick and powerful &s;prings, by the means of which the frater|nity of eloquent and able mini&s;ters have &s;o often and &s;o rapidly been exalted by the queens and abbe&s;&s;es of their re&s;pective countries. But there is a nobler pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="204" REF="205">
my heart inwardly &s;aid to it&s;elf, that, by actuating both of us alike, may facilitate my &s;ucce&s;s with Seraphina; and this is our mutual zeal for the felicity of her fellow-maidens. Could this fair pre&s;ident of au|tumnal virgins be made acquainted with all that I have thought, and all that I have written, in behalf of Old Maids&mdash;but here's my difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s; how can I explain to her, in a few minutes, the long labours of my life?&mdash;While the&s;e ideas were pa&s;&s;ing, with confu&s;ed rapidity, in my mind, Seraphina advanced very near to me. The mild dignity of her a&s;pect extorted from me a bow of affectionate admiration. I made an imperfect effort to tell her &s;o; but, before I could utter a &s;ingle &s;entence to recommend my&s;elf, as I wi&s;hed, to her favour, &s;he &s;aluted me by my name, to my infinite a&s;toni&s;hment; and proceeded to in|form me, with a graceful and engaging fa|miliarity, that the departed mini&s;ter was one of my old friends, who had given her a complete idea both of my per&s;on and my
<PB N="205" REF="206">
character, expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h on his death-bed, in the mo&s;t flattering terms, that I might be cho&s;en to &s;ucceed him in the pa&s;|toral care of this &s;i&s;terhood.
<Q>We are no &s;trangers,</Q>
continued the polite Sera|phina,
<Q>to the benevolent ca&s;t of your &s;tu|dies, and we look with peculiar gratitude on a per&s;on, who&s;e pen has been long employed, with a very &s;ingular humanity, to amu&s;e, to in&s;truct, and, I may &s;ay, to honour, a certain cla&s;s of females, whom the unthinking world have ince&s;&s;antly wounded with deri&s;ion or neglect. It is po&s;&s;ible, Sir,</Q>
&s;he added,
<Q>that your book, to which I allude, however en|riched and adorned with learning and with fancy, with rea&s;on and with wit; it is po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, that this book may not find more kindne&s;s from the world, than what has hitherto attended the degraded order of beings to whom it is &s;o generou&s;ly devoted. But, what|ever fate may attend your work, who&s;e merits have been fully explained to us,
<PB N="206" REF="207">
we &s;hall at lea&s;t enjoy the happine&s;s of &s;ecuring you from many of tho&s;e humi|liating per&s;onal evils, to which the great|e&s;t authors have been expo&s;ed, if you will allow us to appoint you the preacher of our chapel.</Q></P>
<P>Seraphina pau&s;ed for my reply; but my head and heart were too full to allow me the u&s;e of &s;peech in the fir&s;t moments of my &s;urpri&s;e and exultation. I made her the profounde&s;t reverence, that a body not per|fectly ela&s;tic could accompli&s;h. It was as low as the bow of a new-created bi&s;hop to his earthly maker, yet, I fear, it was not &s;o much the genuine movement of humility, as of pride.</P>
<P>Seraphina &s;eemed to read all my &s;enti|ments, and, to relieve me from the perplex|ing difficulty of putting my thanks into proper words, &s;he thus pur&s;ued her di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>It is now the u&s;ual hour of our morn|ing prayers: will you allow me, Sir, the plea&s;ure of introducing you to your new
<PB N="207" REF="208">
office? You will find the books of our chapel in order; and I doubt not but, as you have long meditated on the good and evil of our &s;ingle &s;tate, you can oblige us, on the in&s;tant, with a &s;ermon adapted to our &s;eque&s;tered condition.</Q>
&mdash;Much as I was elated by the flattering appointment, I felt my&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed by this propo&s;al. In truth, I was utterly unprepared; and wi&s;hed to excu&s;e my&s;elf on the &s;core of my dre&s;s, thinking it improper to appear as the pa&s;tor of the&s;e elegant, though ancient maidens, in a ru&s;ty black coat, which time and &s;nuff had con&s;pired to di&s;figure; but ca&s;ting &s;uch a downward glance on my own per&s;on, as every man does, who means to ground an apology on his habit, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find my&s;elf arrayed in a new ca&s;&s;ock. My amazement increa&s;ed, on perceiving that my right hand, which held a clean cambrick handkerchief, was decorated with a magni|ficent ring, not of diamond indeed, but formed by a &s;ingle &s;apphire of uncommon magnitude and lu&s;tre. Without di&s;turbing
<PB N="208" REF="209">
my brain to account for my acqui&s;ition of this &s;urpri&s;ing ornament, I bowed again to the fair pre&s;ident, and followed her towards the chapel. My ring had acted as a tali&s;|man to di&s;pel my embarra&s;&s;ment, and I ad|vanced with &s;uch an air of confidence, as I have formerly ob&s;erved in a courtly preacher, apparently in&s;pired, not indeed by the inward light of the &s;oul, but by the radiance beaming from his own little finger.</P>
<P>We now entered the chapel: it was a &s;tructure of exqui&s;ite proportions, in which elegance and &s;implicity were mo&s;t happily united. The walls were covered with a &s;tucco of very pale dove-colour, enrich|ed with decorations of white marble, con&s;i&s;t|ing chiefly of emblematic figures, expre&s;|&s;ive of innocence and peace. The only painting which this edifice contained, was of gla&s;s; it formed the rich and magnifi|cent window, to which the chapel was in|debted for all the light it received. The effect of this window was truly cele&s;tial; not
<PB N="209" REF="210">
only from the happy di&s;po&s;ition of that &s;oft and &s;olemn radiance which it diffu&s;ed over the building, but from the tran&s;cendent beauty of the figures with which it was en|riched. Cha&s;tity was here repre&s;ented in a meek yet firm po&s;ition, &s;upported by Tem|perance and Fortitude, and paying a kind of mode&s;t homage to Charity and Faith. The two latter were rai&s;ed on a &s;light elevation, and, being united by a po&s;ture of &s;i&s;terly endearment, formed the pyramidical point in this enchanting group. The di&s;tinct cha|racter of every per&s;onage was &s;o exqui&s;itely conceived, and &s;o forcibly expre&s;&s;ed; the connection of all was rendered &s;o happily vi&s;ible by their attention to each other, that no &s;pectator could behold this little a&s;&s;embly of virtues, without feeling a tender reve|rence for each, and without wi&s;hing to be|come the perfect votary of all.</P>
<P>While I gazed on this enchanting pic|ture, the bell began to toll: the numerous &s;i&s;terhod came flocking to their &s;eats: I ad|vanced to the reading de&s;k: I adju&s;ted the
<PB N="210" REF="211">
books: I went through the &s;ervice: and now, with a heart that began to palpitate afre&s;h, I a&s;cended the pulpit. A multitude of curious and piercing eyes fla&s;hed upon me: but my embarra&s;&s;ment was a little re|lieved by a hymn of the divine&s;t melody, mo&s;t admirably &s;ung by a few &s;i&s;ters of the hou&s;e. In the time which this &s;oothing ce|remony allowed me to collect my hurried &s;pirits, it &s;truck me, that the unknown power to whom I was indebted for my ca&s;|&s;ock and my ring, might have happily &s;up|plied me with a &s;upernatural &s;ermon. In this hope I now &s;earched my pockets, but, to my utter di&s;appointment, I could find only a &s;mall copy of the Old Te&s;tament. In confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, I turned ha&s;tily to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, as I thought might befriend me on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. My eye &s;ud|denly fa&s;tened on a text that plea&s;ed me: I clo&s;ed the volume; fat in profound thought for a few minutes; then ro&s;e, with inward exultation, and delivered the following di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><PB N="211" REF="212">
<P>In the 11th Chapter of Judges, and at the 38th Ver&s;e, it is thus written&mdash;
<Q>She went with her Companions, and be|wailed her Virginity.</Q></P>
<P>ALAS! the tender-hearted might &s;ay to them&s;elves, on fir&s;t hearing the&s;e few and &s;imple words, how frequent, how univer&s;al is &s;uch lamentation!&mdash;In every age, and in all the civilized nations of the globe, many incon&s;iderate daugh|ters of Eve have been ha&s;tily led into pe|nitence and &s;orrow, by the violence or the artifice of an imperious and a deceitful pa&s;&s;ion: and often have they bewailed the di&s;honourable lo&s;s of that maiden purity, regarded as the be&s;t, and perhaps the only trea&s;ure, which nature and fortune had be&s;towed upon them.</P>
<P>But it was not &s;o with the fair mourner in my text: &s;he was the cha&s;te and honoured daughter of Jephtha, the Judge of I&s;rael; &s;he bewailed not the
<PB N="212" REF="213">
lo&s;s of her virginity, but that &s;he was de&s;tined to carry it to the grave. Being condemned to die, in compliance with the ra&s;h vow of her father, &s;he lamented not the immediate &s;troke of death, but the idea of dying without having fulfilled her fair expectations of nuptial happine&s;s and maternal delight.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to any remarks on this intere&s;ting &s;tory, let me here ob&s;erve to you, my &s;i&s;ters, that the learned and pious men, who have endeavoured to elucidate the ob&s;curer pa&s;&s;ages of the Old Te&s;tament, are by no means agreed on the real fate of this lovely victim. Some contend that &s;he actually peri&s;hed by a violent death; and others affirm, that &s;he was only condemned to perpe|tual virginity. I will not enter upon the merits of this que&s;tion, becau&s;e, in what|ever light the hi&s;tory of this fair &s;ufferer may be con&s;idered, it equally affords me a proper ground-work for the doctrine I wi&s;h to inculcate. Her &s;orrow, whatever
<PB N="213" REF="214">
its duration might be, naturally leads me to point out to you a great and important truth; a truth, my &s;i&s;ters, in which you are principally concerned! and it is this&mdash; that to pa&s;s through human life, either by a &s;hort or a long journey, and finally to quit it in the character of a virgin, is by no means a ju&s;t cau&s;e for lamenta|tion.</P>
<P>Do not mi&s;take me, I mean not to re|flect, with a cruel a&s;perity, on Jephtha's unhappy daughter! I mean not to in&s;inu|ate aught again&s;t the temper or the mo|de&s;ty of the dam&s;el; that would indeed be barbarous, when her &s;trange mi&s;|chance was &s;o peculiarly &s;evere, as to plead for the tendere&s;t &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion. <HI>She came out to meet</HI> her victorious father, <HI>with timbrels and with dances</HI>; and &s;he was his only child: <HI>be|&s;ide her he had neither &s;on nor daughter.</HI> How bitter mu&s;t be the condition of this darling child, when &s;he found her trium|phant fe&s;tivity turned to angui&s;h, by the
<PB N="214" REF="215">
vow of her precipitate parent! Every humane heart mu&s;t bleed at the idea; and the more, when it remarks with what an affectionate magnanimity &s;he &s;ubmitted to her fate:&mdash;<HI>And &s;he &s;aid unto him, My father, if thou ha&s;t opened thy mouth unto the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, fora&s;much as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies.</HI>&mdash;Generous, heroic maiden! &s;he enjoyed the pa&s;t triumph of her fa|ther, in her own pre&s;ent calamity and de|&s;pair. Her fir&s;t &s;entiments were tho&s;e of the affectionate, di&s;intere&s;ted daughter: if the&s;e were followed by a more &s;elfi&s;h idea, it was &s;ugge&s;ted by a national cu&s;tom, and aro&s;e not from any defects in the &s;pirit and character of the devoted vic|tim. But let us hear how &s;he proceeded! <HI>And &s;he &s;aid unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows!</HI>&mdash;Strange as her reque&s;t
<PB N="215" REF="216">
may &s;ound in a modern ear, it appeared rea&s;onable to her father; <HI>and he &s;aid, Go!</HI>&mdash;and well might he &s;ay &s;o; for her petition was not the dictate of a wan|ton and di&s;&s;olute &s;pirit, preparing to la|ment the lo&s;s of expected plea&s;ure, with coar&s;ene&s;s of &s;entiment and indelicacy of language: no! it proceeded only from her wi&s;h to ob&s;erve a religious ceremony, which prevailed among the unmarried fe|males of her country, who con&s;idered the de&s;tiny of living and of dying in a &s;ingle &s;tate, as the &s;evere&s;t evil that Heaven could inflict. This idea was indeed uni|ver&s;al among the Jews; but the Jews were a moody and a murmuring people, perpetually di&s;po&s;ed to quarrel, not only with the common incidents of life, but with the mo&s;t merciful di&s;pen&s;ations of their God. It is the perver&s;ity of their general judgment on this head, and not the particular conduct of one mo&s;t ami|able and unfortunate maiden, that I mean to cen&s;ure. To guard the whole
<PB N="216" REF="217">
&s;i&s;terhood again&s;t the in&s;idious approaches of di&s;content, I would here demon&s;trate, that to bewail virginity, in the Jewi&s;h &s;en&s;e of bewailing it, is equally irrational and irreligious.</P>
<P>A cu&s;tom, however reprehen&s;ible, which has prevailed among any civilized people, de&s;erves to be fairly con&s;idered, and will generally be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome important advantage to plead in its behalf. This was undoubtedly the ca&s;e in the cu&s;tom I allude to: it wanted not the plea of political wi&s;dom: the female ceremony of bewailing virginity had a&s;|&s;uredly a &s;trong tendency to promote wedlock, and in this point of view it me|rited the countenance of a wi&s;e legi&s;lator: &mdash;but ob&s;erve with what cruelty it mu&s;t have operated upon one unprotected cla&s;s of the community! How wretched mu&s;t have been the condition of an elderly maiden among the Jews, if &s;uch a cha|racter exi&s;ted among them, when &s;he was taught, by the prejudices of the public,
<PB N="217" REF="218">
to de&s;pi&s;e and to dete&s;t her&s;elf, as the ob|ject of human contempt, and divine di&s;|plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>It is an image of humiliation and di&s;|tre&s;s too grievous for a gentle heart to dwell upon. Let us ha&s;ten to contem|plate the very different condition of the &s;ame character among the early Chri&s;|tians!&mdash;Here, indeed, we behold an ex|ce&s;s; but of a more chearful and ami|able complexion: not an exce&s;s of ab&s;urd barbarity, but of tender enthu&s;ia&s;m. In|&s;tead of bewailing virginity as an evil, they exalted it into an evidence of &s;uper|natural merit: they regarded it as a clear title, not only to cele&s;tial bli&s;s, but to the highe&s;t degree of beatitude that Heaven can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>I will not ba&s;ely attempt to ingra|tiate my&s;elf with this audience, by adopting, from the fathers of the Catho|lic church, a flattering, illu&s;ive doctrine, to which the purity of our reformed religion can afford no countenance, for it
<PB N="218" REF="219">
was not countenanced by that meek and righteous Ma&s;ter, who&s;e life and lan|guage are the great, unerring lights that we profe&s;s to follow.</P>
<P>Though an advocate for a &s;ingle life, St. Paul him&s;elf acknowledges, 'That concerning virgins, he had no com|mandment of the Lord:'&mdash;and indeed we find nothing in the words or actions of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, that can be fairly con&s;trued into a recommendation of their &s;ingle &s;tate. That he was very far from being a moro&s;e enemy to the joys, and even the fe&s;tivity of marriage, one of his own miracles has &s;ufficiently evinced: he &s;eems not, however, to have &s;hewn any prejudice or partiality towards any parti|cular order of human beings, but to have re&s;pected all the different conditions of that life, which, for the good of all, he conde&s;cended to a&s;&s;ume. He re&s;pected the natural liberties of mankind: he in|terfered with no civil or &s;ocial duties: he forbad no innocent plea&s;ures; and,
<PB N="219" REF="220">
what is more to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, he recommended not an adherence to any preci&s;e &s;tate of life, becau&s;e his own di|vine in&s;titutions are adapted to every condition into which a human creature can be thrown, by tho&s;e bu&s;y &s;hifters of human &s;cenery, time and chance.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, 'Although we readily allow the benign influence of Chri&s;|tianity, upon all who &s;incerely profe&s;s it, we are warranted by rea&s;on and expe|rience in affirming, that certain modes of life have a tendency to throw a gloom over the mind, and to produce &s;uch a dejection of &s;pirit, as naturally leads to lamentation; and is not the celibacy of an ancient virgin an example of this truth?'</P>
<P>We feel the full force of this que&s;tion; and imagination &s;ets before us, what the world exhibits daily to many a &s;pectator, a di&s;con&s;olate maiden, the daughter of an opulent father, yet accidentally de|prived of all her fair pro&s;pects, all her
<PB N="220" REF="221">
tendere&s;t connections, and de&s;titute of fortune in the decline of life.</P>
<P>Shall we &s;ay to this &s;olitary virgin, 'Bewail not your condition; for, if you are a good Chri&s;tian, you &s;hould be happy?'&mdash;No! we will not addre&s;s her thus; and &s;hame on tho&s;e ill-in&s;tructed mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who in&s;ult the wretch|ed with &s;uch abrupt and unfeeling admo|nition! It is our duty to penetrate, with in&s;inuating tenderne&s;s, into the painful rece&s;&s;es of a &s;uffering &s;pirit. Let us gently &s;earch into the natural train of thought, which depre&s;&s;es the unfortunate virgin, and pur&s;ue that line of con&s;ola|tion, which the pre&s;ent turn of her own mind may effectually &s;ugge&s;t!&mdash;By what is &s;he depre&s;&s;ed? By the contra&s;t, which memory pre&s;ents to her, between the gay fe&s;tivity of her early days, and the neglect and &s;olitude to which &s;he is now re|duced; by the compari&s;on, which ima|gination &s;ugge&s;ts to her, between her own de&s;olate condition, and the different
<PB N="221" REF="222">
de&s;tiny of tho&s;e female companions of her youth, who were &s;o fortunate as to marry. Let us follow this clue, and it may enable us to lead the dejected &s;ufferer from the labyrinth of perplexed and gloomy thoughts into light and peace! Let us fir&s;t indulge and humour the me|lancholy of her &s;pirit! let us allow the &s;eeming &s;everity of her lot! let us &s;ay to her, 'You have, indeed, been unju&s;tly overlooked by men, who have pitched upon companions le&s;s attractive, and have &s;hared their wealth and &s;plendor with partners far le&s;s de&s;erving: but, be|fore you e&s;timate their &s;uppo&s;ed felicity, examine the real &s;tate of tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociates of your youth, whom marriage has placed in a condition &s;o different from your own!&mdash;Let us try the fir&s;t.&mdash;She is a woman of rank, of opulence, of gaiety; but her innocence was undermined by the &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;tituents of her vi&s;ionary happine&s;s; and your heart is too pure to

envy plea&s;ures deba&s;ed by infamy or loaded with remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us proceed to a &s;econd.&mdash;Behold a woman, whom nature and education had rendered a lovely compound of vi|vacity and virtue! She was wedded to the man of her choice, with the &s;anction of her delighted parents. The figure, the reputation, and the fortune of her hu&s;band, made her the envy of all her fair &s;ingle friends: but alas! could they have read her de&s;tiny, &s;he would have excited only compa&s;&s;ion; for &s;he &s;oon found, that the plea&s;ing manners, the enchanting talents, and the bright &s;em|blance of integrity, in the man whom &s;he fondly thought all perfection, covered a mind corrupted by licentious plea&s;ure, and a heart that could only counterfeit, for a very &s;hort period, all the generous characteri&s;tics of genuine love. His pa&s;|&s;ion was extingui&s;hed by a few weeks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and &s;he then experienced, in
<PB N="223" REF="224">
return for real and anxious affection, mor|tifying neglect, contemptuous &s;arca&s;m, and perpetual infidelity. His vices &s;oon produced their natural effect, the ruin of his fortune, his temper, and his health. Haunted by every painful recollection, he now vainly tries to drown, in deeper intemperance, all ideas of his mi&s;ery; while the innocent and &s;till lovely victim of his various crimes, &s;urrounded by in|digent and de&s;erted children, looks up to tho&s;e, her former companions, who have remained unmarried, as the mo&s;t enviable of human beings.</P>
<P>But let us pa&s;s on to a third, and a much happier example of married life.&mdash; Here, indeed, as you truly ob&s;erve, here we find every circum&s;tance of character and condition, that is ju&s;tly entitled to the name of fortunate. In this per&s;on we may behold the beloved wife of an affectionate and a &s;en&s;ible hu&s;band; the healthy and opulent mother of a nume|rous and lovely offspring. She has a
<PB N="224" REF="225">
heart and &s;pirit to reli&s;h happine&s;s, and &s;he is &s;urrounded by every thing that is likely to give and to encrea&s;e it. Her condition is, in truth, oppo&s;ite to that of the elderly, indigent, and &s;olitary mai|den.&mdash;But let us take a nearer view of this fortunate per&s;onage! let us vi&s;it the man&s;ion of felicity!&mdash;Where is the gaiety that &s;hould &s;urround it?&mdash;Good Hea|vens! what evil has befallen it?&mdash;All is di&s;order and di&s;tre&s;s. &mdash; Mi&s;chance has happened to one of the young and favourite branches of this flouri&s;hing hou&s;e.&mdash;It is the cry of the di&s;tracted mother over her darling, torn from her by a calamitous death.&mdash;Let us retire! for <HI>her</HI> we cannot comfort!&mdash;Her grief can be alleviated only by that Almighty Power, who has permitted it to be inflicted. But we have received our le&s;&s;on in the piercing &s;ound of her di&s;tre&s;s. A &s;ingle &s;hriek of the mother, on the expiration of her child, ought to drown for ever all the petty murmuring of maidenly di&s;content.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="226">Let it not be &s;aid, that &s;uch calamities are rare! Who has ever known a nu|merous family unvi&s;ited by &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow? O! ye con&s;iderate virgins! let me lead you to form a true e&s;timate of all the good and evil in female life! Place, if you plea&s;e, to the account of the wife and mother, all the more inten&s;e and more lively plea&s;ures! but enter fairly, at the &s;ame time, her anxieties, her terrors, her agonies, both of body and of mind! enter al&s;o, on your own &s;ide of the account, your exemption from all the&s;e! forget not the more cer|tain and quiet enjoyments, which parti|cularly belong to your own condition! Examine the two accounts with &s;trict impartiality, and perhaps you will find, that, in a cour&s;e of years, the balance has run con&s;iderably in your favour.</P>
<P>But it &s;hould not be the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of a mortal to regard the enjoyments of human life; a concern more important demands the attention of us all; I mean,
<PB N="226" REF="227">
the preparation for death. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible, that the virgin can be properly prepared for this inevitable hour, who has reached the latter end of a long life in the habit of murmuring at her own lot, and thereby condemning the di&s;pen&s;ations of that God, in who&s;e pre&s;ence &s;he is &s;o &s;oon to appear. But, on the other hand, the ancient maiden, who has &s;upported the neglect and inju&s;tice of mankind with pious re&s;ignation and content, has &s;uch advantages over the married woman, in the aweful and important clo&s;e of hu|man exi&s;tence, as more than repays her for any &s;uppo&s;ed or real inferiority in the point of worldly enjoyments. Let us pur&s;ue this idea! it leads us to intere&s;t|ing contemplation. Circum&s;tances that attend the dying, of every &s;tation, are par|ticularly de&s;erving of our notice; be|cau&s;e, however different the degrees and fa&s;hions of our lives, in the act of death we mu&s;t all re&s;emble each other. It is a trial univer&s;ally endured, though va|riou&s;ly
<PB N="227" REF="228">
&s;u&s;tained. Let me then conduct you, my &s;i&s;ters, to two &s;cenes of this kind, different from each other, yet both affecting and in&s;tructive!&mdash;Let us fir&s;t approach, and con&s;ider the death-bed of the Wife!&mdash;Behold a woman of virtue and of piety! behold her, after many ble&s;|&s;ings thankfully received, and many du|ties faithfully di&s;charged, behold her de|voutly ha&s;tening to her heavenly reward! &mdash;See! though her frame is &s;hattered, her mind is &s;till &s;edate!&mdash;yet &s;ee with what tender angui&s;h &s;he takes leave of an af|flicted hu&s;band, who has been her fond and faithful guide in the paths of inno|cence and religion!&mdash;ob&s;erve how her fortitude is &s;haken, by reading in his features a vehemence of di&s;tre&s;s bur&s;ting through the kind ma&s;k of re&s;ignation, which, in pity to her &s;ufferings, he vainly labours to wear!</P>
<P>Yet even this is not her &s;evere&s;t trial: as her life is ha&s;tening to its clo&s;e, &s;he yields to a parental and irre&s;i&s;tible de|&s;ire;
<PB N="228" REF="229">
&s;he calls for her children, to fold them for the la&s;t time to her bo&s;om.&mdash; Good Heavens! what a &s;cene!&mdash;O God! relea&s;e her, for &s;he has lo&s;t the firmne&s;s of piety it&s;elf!&mdash;her &s;oul, engro&s;&s;ed by the wants and &s;orrows of the&s;e little inno|cents, and by a dreadful idea of what they may &s;uffer, &s;hould their father al&s;o be taken from them&mdash;her di&s;tracted &s;oul pays no longer its ju&s;t obedience to the &s;ummons of her Maker!&mdash;Yet thou art not offended, Almighty Parent! for there are weakne&s;&s;es peculiarly entitled to thy mercy; and &s;uch are the fond exce&s;&s;es of a maternal heart, to which thou ha&s;t al|lotted the extremes of delight and agony.</P>
<P>Let us turn from this heart-rending &s;cene, to one, though equally aweful, yet much le&s;s afflicting! Let us approach the death-bed of the Ancient Maiden!&mdash; Behold a woman, not endued with a more cultivated under&s;tanding, or with more habitual piety, than the dying mo|ther whom we have ju&s;t beheld! but
<PB N="229" REF="230">
O! with what a different frame of mind and heart does the pre&s;ent expiring mor|tal &s;upport the mo&s;t &s;triking, if not the mo&s;t important, of human trials!

Here religion operates without a check. This elderly, expiring virgin has, indeed, her tender attachments to relinqui&s;h; but &s;he bids adieu to her friends with the placid air of one who is &s;etting forth on a long|wi&s;hed-for journey. She does not hurry from the world with the over-heated enthu&s;ia&s;m of Romi&s;h nuns, who call them&s;elves, with an unbecoming famili|arity and fervour of language, the &s;pou&s;es of their God.&mdash;No! &s;he contemplates
<PB N="230" REF="231">
the gracious promi&s;es of her Redeemer with the humble confidence of a faithful and affectionate &s;ervant. She prepares to meet him with the meek obedience of tender humanity and unperverted rea&s;on, willing to quit a world, where &s;he has been frequently wronged and neglected, to enter tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed regions where neglect or inju&s;tice can never be ad|mitted.</P>
<P>O! my &s;i&s;ters, what is the le&s;&s;on that the&s;e contra&s;ted &s;cenes may &s;ugge&s;t to us? Is it not this? that every good and wi&s;e virgin of advanced life, in&s;tead of &s;inking into the Jewi&s;h folly of bewail|ing her virginity, &s;hould regard it as a pa&s;&s;port from Providence, which may have conducted her through a vexatious world, exempt from many of its &s;evere&s;t troubles; and which may at la&s;t enable her to pa&s;s the gates of death, not with reluctant angui&s;h, but with rational com|po&s;ure and devout exultation.&mdash;To crown all our di&s;quietudes and conflicts by an

end &s;o happy, is a de&s;tiny that the pure&s;t and happie&s;t of human characters might e&s;teem, perhaps, the mo&s;t de&s;irable of ble&s;&s;ings; and to this, my beloved &s;i&s;ters, may the God of purity conduct us all!&mdash; Amen.</P></Q>
<P>In de&s;cending from the pulpit I ob&s;erved, with an hone&s;t pride, the effect of my di&s;|cour&s;e in the features of the &s;i&s;terhood. Several of them pre&s;&s;ed around me to ut|ter their compliments on the occa&s;ion; while others contrived to compliment their preacher in a manner &s;till more engaging, by di&s;covering to me, without affectation, the traces of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;iding tears, which I had drawn from my tender audience, not by the real excellence of my &s;ermon, but by the cordial fervour and apparent &s;incerity of my zeal. In truth, I had preached to them from the bottom of a feeling and benevo|lent heart; and I had rai&s;ed &s;o forcibly before my own eyes the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive images which I pre&s;ented to them, that, in deliver|ing
<PB N="232" REF="233">
my &s;ermon, I was my&s;elf affected even to tears, and obliged to pau&s;e, more than once, to recover the powers of my &s;u&s;pended voice.&mdash;The lady Seraphina, who &s;poke to me, as pre&s;ident, in the name of the com|munity, had begun to honour me with a very delicate encomium, but checked her|&s;elf on a &s;udden; and, ob&s;erving that I had exhau&s;ted my&s;elf to &s;uch a degree that I was ready to faint, &s;he ha&s;tily di&s;patched the good Mele&s;inda for a gla&s;s of hart&s;horn and water. I was &s;till within the chapel; for, perceiving my&s;elf in &s;ome danger of falling, I had &s;upported my weak and emaciated body again&s;t a pillar. The compa&s;&s;ionate lady abbe&s;s held one of my hands, which an&s;wered the hone&s;t pre&s;&s;ure of her gene|rous anxiety. Her favourite Fu&s;cina con|tinued, by her direction, to cha&s;e my tem|ples till the hart&s;horn arrived. I drank it with &s;ome difficulty, and, regaining a little portion of &s;trength, I &s;aid to my charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tants, in a feeble and broken voice,
<Q>Be not alarmed, my good &s;i&s;ters! you

The attentive lady abbe&s;s endeavoured to rai&s;e and comfort me with the mo&s;t friendly and endearing expre&s;&s;ions. She now conducted me, in the tendere&s;t manner, into her own private apartment. She &s;eated me on a mo&s;t comfortable &s;opha, that filled a large rece&s;s in an elegant and &s;pacious parlour. The room was decorated with many beautiful works, both of the needle and the pencil; but alas! I was unable to contemplate their re&s;pective beauties, for the &s;hades of death appeared now to be gathering very fa&s;t around me. The kind &s;olicitude of Seraphina re|doubled: &s;he di&s;covered the mo&s;t fervent de&s;ire to re&s;tore my health.
<Q>Excellent lady!</Q>
I exclaimed, with all the little voice that I could rai&s;e,
<Q>di&s;quiet not thy tender bo&s;om with a vain expectation!&mdash;I
<PB N="234" REF="235">
perceive that my la&s;t moment is near, and I ought not to regret it, &s;ince I have obtained and enjoyed the great object of my ambition, the affectionate favour of your &s;i&s;terhood. Yet there is one thing that I have &s;till to wi&s;h, and you alone can indulge me.</Q>&mdash;<Q>O name it! name it!</Q>
&s;aid the tender abbe&s;s, pre&s;&s;ing my cold hand, and wetting it with her tears. "Yes, madam," I replied,
<Q>I will lay before you all the little weakne&s;&s;es of a heart that has much to hope, and little to fear, from a being &s;o benevolent and gentle as you are. I am a vain creature; but your tenderne&s;s will call my vanity a virtue. Indeed I covet not the mo&s;t envied di&s;tinction; I &s;igh not for pre-eminence in learning, genius, or wit: yet, I confe&s;s to you, I wi&s;h with great fervour to attract the notice of po&s;terity; I wi&s;h, that as long as my name endures, it may be honoured with the affectionate remembrance of my fellow-creatures, and particularly with the tender e&s;teem

of your &s;i&s;terhood.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>It mu&s;t, it mu&s;t,</Q>
&s;aid the good abbe&s;s, &s;obbing. &mdash; "O!" replied I, enfolding one of her hands within mine,
<Q>&s;ecure to me this de|lightful di&s;tinction! you have the power of doing &s;o:&mdash;give me your promi&s;e, that I &s;hall be buried in your chapel, under a &s;imple &s;lab of white marble, with this in&s;cription;
<Q>Here lies --- ---- The Friend and Pa&s;tor of Old Maids.</Q></Q>
The kind abbe&s;s a&s;&s;ented, and I thus con|tinued:&mdash;
<Q>I have yet another reque&s;t: pray forgive the whim&s;ies of a fond, and, perhaps, fooli&s;h old man! &mdash; I conjure you, let me not be removed from this chamber, till the day of my interment!&mdash; place me in my coffin ju&s;t as I am, in this my pa&s;toral habit! and, as I confe&s;s

<P>The tender Seraphina continued to &s;ig|nify her perfect acquie&s;cence in all my de|&s;ires; not by di&s;tinct words, indeed, but a &s;eries of the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and endearing ge&s;tures. &mdash;"Enough! enough!" I ex|claimed, in a &s;epulchral tone; and, be&s;tow|ing upon her a benediction but half articu|lated, I with difficulty rai&s;ed her unre&s;i&s;ting hand to my clammy lips, then gently laid it on my own throbbing heart, and, having &s;queezed it again&s;t my bo&s;om in a &s;trong convul&s;ive pre&s;&s;ure, expired.</P>
<P>My &s;pirit, however, remained fluttering and invi&s;ible in the chamber, and &s;eemed to contemplate, with a &s;ort of &s;eraphic pride, the cha&s;te, weeping abbe&s;s, and my own lifele&s;s body. The excellent Sera|phina would not quit the corp&s;e for a &s;ingle moment, till &s;he was thoroughly per&s;uaded
<PB N="237" REF="238">
that the breath of the lamented pa&s;tor was departed from him for ever. She then gave &s;uch orders as were nece&s;&s;ary for the li|teral accompli&s;hment of my reque&s;t. She permitted &s;elect parties of the kind and cu|rious &s;i&s;terhood to enter the apartment by turns, and indulge them&s;elves in contem|plating the countenance of their departed friend. My &s;pirit was highly flattered and entertained by their various comments upon it, and by their many quick vici&s;&s;itudes of maidenly curio&s;ity and regret. At length a &s;imple but elegant coffin was brought to the &s;opha on which I died. The body, without any change of dre&s;s, was depo&s;ited within it; but the coffin remained open. The admirable lady abbe&s;s her&s;elf deter|mined to &s;et the community an example of tender and generous attachment. She did me the unu&s;ual honour of watching the body the fir&s;t night, attended by her two favourite &s;i&s;ters. In the evening of the &s;ub&s;equent day, it happened that Mele&s;inda and Fu&s;|cina were left alone in this office. They
<PB N="238" REF="239">
endeavoured to amu&s;e each other by entering into a very curious and diverting debate on my character and con&s;titution: but my mo|de&s;ty will not allow me to repeat the many flattering things which were uttered on this occa&s;ion.

<Q>I would give the world to re&s;tore him.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;he uttered the&s;e words, &s;he ca&s;t a piercing eye on my countenance, and, wet|ting the tip of her fingers with a little bot|tle of lavender-water, which &s;he held in her left hand, &s;he began to rub my temples with an eager anxiety, yet with &s;ome degree of

that awe and trepidation which the dead are apt to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>In a few moments &s;he exclaimed,
<Q>Look! look! my dear Mele&s;inda! am I mi&s;taken? or may we not perceive a little dawn of colour on his cheek?</Q>
&mdash; Her benevolent heart beat high with expecta|tion; and, &s;eizing my hand, &s;he &s;aid aloud, with the commanding, ec&s;tatic air of a bene|ficent enchantre&s;s &mdash;

&mdash;She &s;eemed to &s;peak with a prophetic tran&s;port; and at the &s;ame time &s;queezed my hand with &s;uch forcible pre&s;&s;ure, that I awaked with mingled &s;en&s;ations of pain and exultation.</P>
<P>I looked wi&s;tfully around, and was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find, in&s;tead of a kind and hone&s;t old maiden on each &s;ide of me, St. Ba&s;il's Di&s;cour&s;e on Virginity at my left hand, and towards the right, an exhau&s;ted bottle of port.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT di&s;patch this courteous and gallant performance to the pre&s;s, without recommending it, by a Po&s;t&s;cript, to the particular patronage of that illu&s;tri|ous fraternity, the Knights of the Garter, with the original purpo&s;e of who&s;e in&s;titu|tion it will be found to have a very &s;ingu|lar conformity.</P>
<P>I have heard, that a certain noble lord was free enough to declare, on receiving his blue riband, that he &s;hould not be much embarra&s;&s;ed by the new duties which it impo&s;ed upon him; namely, tho&s;e of kil|ling dragons and defending virgins: inti|mating, with a &s;arca&s;tic levity, hardly be|coming a true knight, that a dragon and a virgin were equal rarities in the living world. What &s;ucce&s;s this noble per&s;on
<PB N="244" REF="244">
may have met with in his knightly pur|&s;uits and encounters, I know not; but I flatter my&s;elf, that I have happily per|formed the very exploits, for the attempt of which this ancient and noble order of knighthood was originally created; though I fear the whole fraternity of modern knights have, like the facetious lord I have alluded to, rather derided than ful|filled the high duties of their profe&s;&s;ion. In proof of my own atchievements, I mu&s;t over&s;tep my natural mode&s;ty to ob&s;erve, that in my chapter on the envy and ill-nature of Old Maids, I have &s;ubdued, or at lea&s;t manfully attacked, not only one, but many dragons; for I doubt not but that incom|parable naturali&s;t, the Count de Buffon, will allow me, that the envious, ill-natured Old Maid is the mo&s;t genuine dragon that nature has produced: that I have defended virgins, envy her&s;elf cannot deny; and, by chu&s;ing to undertake the defence of Old Maids, I have defended tho&s;e virgins who are undoubtedly the mo&s;t likely to pre&s;erve
<PB N="245" REF="245">
their purity, and of cour&s;e are the mo&s;t en|titled to protection.&mdash;Having thus fairly proved my unexampled preten&s;ions to their regard, I recommend it as a point of honour, to all the princes and peers who are at pre|&s;ent inrolled under the banner of our com|mon patron St. George, to make me a little public acknowledgment for the unprece|dented &s;ervices which I have rendered to virginity, in their place. I doubt not but every true Knight will chearfully contribute the annual &s;um of twenty guineas, on &s;o ju&s;t an occa&s;ion, and think it a very mo|derate compen&s;ation for his own particular &s;hare in the&s;e more than Herculean la|bours, which I have happily performed, as a kind of acting lieutenant to the whole brotherhood of Knights. As this mo&s;t noble Order con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-&s;ix members, the contribution I have propo&s;ed, allowing for vacancies in the Order, will &s;upply me with an annual revenue of four hundred gui|neas; a decent provi&s;ion for an hone&s;t ve|teran, worn out in this glorious warfare!

a well-earned &s;tipend, to which I have a&s;|&s;uredly an unrivalled claim; and for which, I &s;hall be happy to &s;ee my&s;elf regi&s;tered in the Court-calendar, with the new and truly honourable title of Deputy Dragon-queller, and Deputy Defender of Virgins, to all the Knights of the mo&s;t noble Order of the Garter!</P>
<P>I am the more free to give this hint to the illu&s;trious fraternity, becau&s;e, as my work, I tru&s;t, may be truly called a national &s;ervice, I certainly ought to receive a public reward; and, to the di&s;credit of our coun|try, I cannot di&s;cover, in all the pages of the red book above-mentioned, any place already exi&s;ting, which may be con&s;idered as a proper compen&s;ation for my important labours. To the &s;hame of a country which prides it&s;elf on atchievements in literature, there are no po&s;ts of decent profit appro|priated to literary heroes. To the di&s;grace and &s;orrow of the Mu&s;es, our poet laureat him&s;elf is regi&s;tered, in the &s;aid red book, as receiving a &s;tipend inferior to that a&s;&s;igned
<PB N="247" REF="247">
in the &s;ame volume to his maje&s;ty's barber. I hope this may be an error of the pre&s;s; for I own it appears to me a kind of trea|&s;onable &s;arca&s;m on all the late monarchs who have filled the Engli&s;h throne, by in|timating, that he who decorates the out&s;ide of our &s;overeign's head, is entitled to a higher reward, than he is, who&s;e labours are directed to exalt the mind and enliven the fancy of his king. However this may be, as the laureat's office has been recently con|ferred on a gentleman to whom literature is infinitely indebted, I &s;incerely hope his ma|je&s;ty will graciou&s;ly correct the unprincely &s;cantine&s;s of the &s;tipend, which cu&s;tom has a&s;&s;igned to his poet, by adding a mitre to his laurel.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I &s;hould, like other vete|rans, very humbly lay my long &s;ervices and hard fortunes before the &s;overeign of the knightly order, who&s;e duties I have di&s;|charged, and implore his protection of this performance, were I not re&s;trained by a ge|nerous
<PB N="248" REF="248">
regard to the fine feelings of a lite|rary prince.</P>
<P>I am convinced, indeed, that his munifi|cent &s;pirit would be mo&s;t willing to pa|troni&s;e an author, who has &s;o heroically defended the mo&s;t unprotected cla&s;s of his faithful and fair &s;ubjects; but I recollect with pain, that his Maje&s;ty (God ble&s;s him!) found him&s;elf &s;o exhau&s;ted by other acts of bounty, that he was unable to in|crea&s;e, at the reque&s;t of his Chancellor, the little and hardly-earned &s;tipend of an illu&s;|trious literary pen&s;ioner, who wi&s;hed to be &s;upported in the expence of trying, if a fo|reign climate would retard or alleviate that &s;troke of death, which was &s;oon to relea&s;e him from all the mi&s;eries of mortal de|pendance.</P>
<P>When I think what a king, who pro|fe&s;&s;es a regard for literature, mu&s;t have &s;uf|fered from &s;uch inability to &s;upply the tran&s;ient wants of a dying genius, who did honour to his reign, I cannot bear the idea
<PB N="249" REF="249">
of expo&s;ing a royal patron of letters even to a much &s;maller degree of &s;imilar con|cern, which he mu&s;t certainly feel, if the champion of Old Maids applied to him for a gratuity, that he could not afford to be|&s;tow. Perhaps I am too delicate in this point; perhaps, regarding the glory, as well as the quiet and convenience of my &s;overeign, I ought to conjure him to coun|teract, in the eyes of po&s;terity, by all po&s;&s;i|ble attention to men of letters, his refu&s;al to increa&s;e the &s;alary of an aged, di&s;tem|pered morali&s;t; &s;uch a refu&s;al, as, if it were not to be weighed, in the balance of can|dour, with many oppo&s;ite acts of munifi|cence, would be &s;ufficient to annihilate all the literary fame of an Augu&s;tus. But as this, though it is hone&s;t, loyal, and friendly language, might be mi&s;interpreted by &s;ome courtly yet rough critics, I &s;hall not at|tempt to introduce it (where it might ap|pear, perhaps, an amu&s;ing novelty) within the precincts of the court.</P>
<P>When I reflect, indeed, on the refined
<PB N="250" REF="250">
characters, capacities, and occupations of our peers; when I con&s;ider, that to many of the&s;e noble per&s;ons, a book is the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s thing in the world, and that &s;ome of them, who generou&s;ly conde&s;cend to read a modern publication, yet prudently avoid the extravagance of buying it; when I re|collect, that a certain noble lord, who has affected the character of a Mecaenas, and is enriched by a &s;inecure of &s;ome thou&s;ands per annum, was wi&s;e enough to declare, in a book&s;eller's &s;hop, that he could not afford to purcha&s;e a new performance (which he confe&s;&s;ed he had heard commended) on be|ing informed that the author had affixed to it the enormous price of &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix pence; when I reflect, I &s;ay, on the&s;e points, I chearfully retract my pre|ceding application for the lucrative pa|tronage of the Great, being convinced, that mo&s;t of them may expend the annual &s;um of twenty guineas much more to their own convenience and plea&s;ure, than by contri|buting
<PB N="251" REF="251">
to the &s;upport of any author what|ever.</P>
<P>In truth, I &s;hould deem it, on more ma|ture reflection, a degradation of my own dignity to accept any patronage, except that of the numerous, intelligent, and pow|erful &s;i&s;terhood, to whom my pen has been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly and affectionately devoted. There is, undoubtedly, &s;ome propriety in con&s;idering the order of Old Maids as the genuine patrons of literature, &s;ince curio&s;ity, the mythological parent of all knowledge, is their e&s;tabli&s;hed characteri&s;tic; and &s;uch, indeed, is the proficiency which &s;ome fair individuals of this order have lately made in polite learning, that, con&s;idering the little attention paid to this article by our men of bu&s;ine&s;s and our men of plea&s;ure, there is rea&s;on to believe, that the &s;ociety of Old Maids will very &s;oon be found the mo&s;t learned body in this enlightened kingdom.</P>
<P>As, I tru&s;t, I am the fir&s;t author who has expre&s;sly dedicated his life and labours to

this worthy &s;ociety, I flatter my&s;elf they will be unanimous in the opinion, that &s;o vo|luntary and unprecedented an attachment has entitled me to a &s;ignal reward: I &s;hall therefore &s;ugge&s;t to them an idea that may conduce to our mutual honour; I &s;hall mo|de&s;tly advi&s;e them to ennoble and &s;upport their profe&s;&s;ed &s;ervant, as the good people of our nation formerly &s;upported their prince, by a contribution according to their re|&s;pective fortunes, intitled <HI>a benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>I recommend it to all the genuine Old Maids, who receive plea&s;ure from my book (and, I tru&s;t, this de&s;cription will include the whole &s;i&s;terhood), to form them&s;elves into little convocations of their order in their re&s;pective counties; that each convo|cation may in&s;tantly appoint a pre&s;ident, to prevent confu&s;ion in their debates, and a maiden &s;ecretary, to collect and ve&s;t in the hands of my book&s;eller this honourable little tax, which, I doubt not, they will chearfully levy on them&s;elves, in proportion
<PB N="253" REF="255">
to their finances, and to the amu&s;ement af|forded them by this performance. As I have a very exalted opinion of the cha&s;tity and munificence of my fair countrywomen, I am per&s;uaded that, however &s;mall the quota may be which every ancient maiden may contribute, the &s;um total of this bene|volence will reflect the highe&s;t glory both on me and my patrons. To &s;hew that I have a &s;pirit able to keep pace with their liberality, I think it proper to make the following declaration:&mdash;Expecting the &s;um to be very great, I am determined not to dimini&s;h the capital, but, ve&s;ting it in the bank of England, to content my&s;elf with the intere&s;t till my death, which, as I have pa&s;&s;ed my grand climacteric, can hardly be very di&s;tant; I &s;hall then bequeath this noble &s;um as a patriotic legacy, in tru&s;t, to our active and patient young mini&s;ter, who will find it, I hope, no trifling a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to his arduous and important project of reducing our national debt; and, without
<PB N="254" REF="256">
doubt, he will prove a very warm friend to this performance, when he &s;ees me convert|ing my cha&s;te patrone&s;&s;es, the Old Maids, into pillars of our &s;tate.</P>
<P>My readers will now perceive, to their great &s;urpri&s;e, that the &s;ucce&s;s of my E&s;&s;ay on Old Maids is a matter of high moment to the intere&s;t of our country&mdash;a point that my mode&s;ty would not allow me to men|tion (as authors le&s;s delicate would un|doubtedly have done) in the fir&s;t pages of my fir&s;t volume.</P>
<P>Having thus chalked out a glorious line of conduct for my fair patrons and my&s;elf, I have only to take my leave, with a re|&s;pectful bow to the &s;i&s;terhood; and this I cannot do better, than by declaring the in|finite value that I &s;et upon their favour. Princes them&s;elves are but pen&s;ioners of the public, and, as my dignity and revenue will ari&s;e from the pure&s;t part of that public, I may certainly, by the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical e&s;timate of human honours, rank my&s;elf
<PB N="255" REF="257">
as &s;uperior to princes, if I acquire and &s;upport the hitherto unknown and un|&s;urpa&s;&s;able title of Gentleman Pen&s;ioner to the immaculate community of Old Maids.</P>
