<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE travels of an Engli&s;hman through|out Europe, and even in &s;ome parts of A&s;ia, to &s;often the &s;orrows of the Pri&s;oner, excited in the mind of the Author the &s;ubject of the following pages, which, formed into a dramatic &s;tory, have produced from the Theatre a profit far exeeeding the u&s;ual pecuniary advantages ari&s;ing from a &s;ucce&s;s|ful Comedy.</P>
<P>The uncertainty in what part of the Ea&s;t the hero of the pre&s;ent piece was (at the time it was written) di&s;pen&s;ing his benevo|lence, cau&s;ed the Writer, after many re|&s;earches and objections, to fix the &s;cene on the i&s;land of Sumatra, where the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement, the &s;y&s;tem of government, and every de&s;cription of the manners of the peo|ple, reconcile the incidents of the Play to the &s;tricte&s;t degree of probability.</P>

<P>Yes; your character&mdash;that, you know, is all the fortune we poor Engli&s;hmen, &s;itu|ated in India, expect with a wife who cro&s;&s;es the &s;ea at the hazard of her life, to make us happy.</P>

<P>Yes; do you &s;uppo&s;e he is as forget|ful as he pretends to be? no, no&mdash;but becau&s;e he is a favourite with the Sultan, and all our great men at court, he thinks it genteel or convenient to have no memory&mdash;and yet I'll an&s;wer for it, he has one of the be&s;t in the univer&s;e.</P>

<P>I don't believe your charge.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, though he forgets his ap|pointments with his trade&s;men, did you ever hear of his forgetting to go to court when a place was to be di&s;po&s;ed of? Did he ever make a blunder, and &s;end a bribe to a man out of power? Did he ever forget to kneel before the Prince of this I&s;land&mdash;or to look in his highne&s;s's pre&s;ence like the &s;ta|tue of Patient-re&s;ignation in humble expectation?&mdash;</P>

<SP>

<P>Sent from his own country in his very infancy, and brought up in the different

<SPEAKER>Lady. [to Twineall.]</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, his Lord&s;hip has made a mi&s;take in the word "ridiculous," which I am &s;ure he did not mean to &s;ay&mdash;but he is apt to make u&s;e of one word for another&mdash;his Lord&s;hip has been &s;o long out of England, that he may be &s;aid in &s;ome mea&s;ure to have forgotten his native language.</P>
</SP>

<P>And you have perfectly explained, Ma|dam&mdash;indeed I ought to have been convinced,
<PB N="9" REF="14">without your explanation, that if his Lord&s;hip made u&s;e of the word <HI>ridiculous</HI> (even intention|ally) that the word had now changed its former &s;en&s;e, and was become a mode to expre&s;s &s;atisfac|tion&mdash;or his Lord&s;hip wou'd not have made u&s;e of it in the very forcible manner he did, to a per|fect &s;tranger.</P>

<L>SINCE all are &s;prung, they &s;ay, from Mother Earth,</L>
<L>Why &s;tamp a merit or di&s;grace on birth?</L>
<L>Yet &s;o it is, however we di&s;gui&s;e it,</L>
<L>All boa&s;t their origin, or el&s;e de&s;pi&s;e it.</L>
<L>This pride or &s;hame haunts ev'ry living &s;oul</L>
<L>From Hyde-park Corner, down to Limehou&s;e Hole:</L>
<L>Peers, taylors, poets, &s;tate&s;men, undertakers,</L>
<L>Knights, &s;quires, man-milliners, and peruke-makers.</L>
<L><HI>Sir Hugh Glengluthglin,</HI> from the land of goats,</L>
<L>Tho' out at elbows, &s;hews you all his coats;</L>
<L>And rightful heir to <HI>twenty pounds</HI> per annum,</L>
<L>Boa&s;ts the rich blood that warm'd his great great gran|nam;</L>
<L>While wealthy Simon Soap&s;uds; ju&s;t be-knighted,</L>
<L>Struck with the &s;word of &s;tate, is grown dim &s;ighted,</L>
<L>Forgets the neighbouring chins he u&s;ed to lather,</L>
<L>And &s;carecely knows he ever had a father.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Author, then, correct in every line,</L>
<L>From nature's characters hath pictur'd mine;</L>
<L>For many a lofty fair, who, friz'd and curl'd,</L>
<L>With cre&s;t of hor&s;e hair, tow'ring thro' the world,</L>
<L>To powder, pa&s;te, and pins, ungrateful grown,</L>
<L>Thinks the full periwig is all her own;</L>
<L>Proud of her conquering ringlets, onward goes,</L>
<L>Nor thanks the barber, from who&s;e hands &s;he ro&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus doth fal&s;e pride fanta&s;tic minds mi&s;lead,</L>
<L>And make our weaker &s;ex &s;eem weak indeed:</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e, to prove this truth, in mirthful &s;train,</L>
<L>We bring the <HI>Dripping family</HI> again.&mdash;</L>
<L>Papa, a tallow chandler by de&s;cent,</L>
<L>Had read "how <HI>larning</HI> is mo&s;t excellent:"</L>
<L>So Mi&s;s, returned from boarding &s;chool at Bow,</L>
<L>Waits to be fini&s;hed by Mama and Co.&mdash;</L>

"<HI>See, &s;pou&s;e, how &s;pruce our Nan is grown, and tall</HI>;</L>

<L>Away fly Ma' and Mi&s;s to dancing room&mdash;</L>

<L>"<HI>Ma'am&s;elle, me teach a you de &s;tep to tread;</HI></L>

<L>"<HI>One, two, dree, &s;inka, ri&s;a, balance; bon,</HI></L>

<L>"<HI>I dream'd la&s;t night, Ma, I &s;hould be a Lady.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus do the <HI>Drippings,</HI> all important grown,</L>
<L>Expect to &s;hine with lu&s;tre not their own;</L>
<L>New airs are got, fre&s;h graces, and fre&s;h wa&s;hes,</L>
<L>New caps, new gauze, new feathers, and new &s;a&s;hes;</L>
<L>Till ju&s;t complete for conque&s;t at Guildhall.</L>
<L>Down comes an order to &s;u&s;pend the ball.</L>
<L>Mi&s;s Shrieks, Ma' &s;colds, Pa' &s;eems to have lo&s;t his tether;</L>
<L>Caps, cu&s;tards, coronets&mdash;all &s;ink together&mdash;</L>
<L>Papa re&s;umes his jacket, dips away,</L>
<L>And Mi&s;s lives &s;ingle, till next Lord Mayor's day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If &s;uch the <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> and if &s;uch the &s;trife,</L>
<L>That break the comforts of dome&s;tic life,</L>
<L>Look to the hero, who this night appears,</L>
<L>Who&s;e boundle&s;s excellence the World reveres;</L>
<L>Who, friend to nature, by no blood confin'd,</L>
<L>Is the glad relative of all mankind.</L>
