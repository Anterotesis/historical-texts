<HEAD>DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Legend having been read to a &s;mall Circle of &s;elect Friends, one Lady, with great Eager|ne&s;s of Manner, a&s;ked the Editor, to whom he intended to dedicate it? He replied, with Truth, that he had not yet determined. "To whom," added &s;he, <Q>can you &s;o properly addre&s;s it, as to <HI>Him,</HI> who&s;e Image cleaves to us during the Recital; <HI>Him,</HI> to whom we owe a livelier Idea of RICHARD the <HI>Third,</HI> than either Hi&s;torian or Painter ever gave; <HI>Him,</HI> who&s;e Judge ment and Powers of Execution keep Pace with the fine Imagination of that <HI>Poet,</HI> whom <HI>He delighteth to Honour?</HI></Q> The&s;e were nearly her exact Words, and the Editor pleads them in Excu&s;e for the Liberty he now takes of dedicating this Poem, With great Re&s;pect and E&s;teem, TO DAVID GARRICK, E&s;q.</P>

<HEAD>PREFATORY ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem fell into the Editor's Hands by a peculiar Means, which he is not at pre&s;ent permitted to reveal. He hopes the Singularity of the Story, and the moral Ten|dency, which &s;o obviou&s;ly and &s;trongly in|culcates THE DUTY OF A PATIENT SUBMIS|SION TO THE DESTINATIONS OF PROVIDENCE, IN ALL VICISSITUDES AND AFFLICTIONS OF LIFE, will ju&s;tify his giving it to the World. He judged it too curious to be ut|terly lo&s;t; and his De&s;ire to pre&s;erve it,
