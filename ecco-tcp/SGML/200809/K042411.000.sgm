<HEAD>THE HISTORY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_YOU de&s;ire me to give you &s;ome Account of the Death of the <HI>Widow</HI> at the <HI>CROWN-INN</HI> in the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of this Country; and how Affairs have gone &s;ince you left the Place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widow,</HI> you know, was a good &s;ort of a Woman; &s;he was Pious and Charitable, and did a great deal of Good among her poor Neighbours: Went con&s;tantly to the Pari&s;h-Church on <HI>Sundays,</HI> and in general had the Character of a con&s;cientious motherly Wo|man.</P>
<P>Her Husband, whil&s;t he lived, was one of the hone&s;te&s;t Men breathing: 'Tis true he would take his Gla&s;s in Company, as all his Countrymen will do: But he was a downright hone&s;t Fellow, and lov'd the Town; and we &s;hall never forget how tightly he &s;tood by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> when Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> our High Sheriff, would have infring'd on our <HI>Right of Commoning.</HI> Poor Man! he kept her from ill Advice whil&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="3">
he lived, and the whole Country was heartily &s;orry for his Death, having not left an ho|ne&s;ter Man behind him in the <HI>Pari&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>But what need I tell you things which you are as well acquainted with as my &s;elf, only to refre&s;h your Memory in &s;ome <HI>Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> previous to your Reque&s;t? You de&s;ire to know the Di&s;po&s;ition of the E&s;tate, and how the <HI>Three Farms</HI> &s;tand affected at this Day.</P>
<P>You remember at her fir&s;t coming to the Hou&s;e, &s;he found the Debts of an old <HI>Law-Suit</HI> to be paid, which had la&s;ted long, and a new one ju&s;t ready to begin, which no body could gue&s;s the Event of. Money there was little or none in the Hou&s;e; and only a few <HI>Exchequer</HI> Notes, which no body but the Ex|ci&s;eman would take for Ready Money.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Tenants</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;tomers</HI> were very un|willing to &s;ee her ruined; and as &s;he had treated them very hand&s;omly at her <HI>Hou&s;e|warming,</HI> they &s;wore they would &s;tand by her again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers. By Oppo&s;ers you know who they meant: For it was by this time certainly known, that old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage,</HI> the Ex|tortioner, had &s;et up a <HI>Competitor</HI> again&s;t her, <HI>Pretending</HI> he was a real <HI>Branch</HI> of the anti|ent Family of the <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s, formerly Lords of the <HI>MANOR,</HI> and brought a Writ of E|jectment in his Name, and fee'd Council a|gain&s;t the Widow. This <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI> is one who has always made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to entertain Renegadoes and Impo&s;tors; and by forged Deeds and Wills to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of E&s;tates,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
and then maintain them by trouble &s;ome Law Suits; till at la&s;t he has &s;hared a hand&s;ome Compo&s;ition for him&s;elf. You cannot chu&s;e too but know, that both by <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Deed</HI> of <HI>Gift,</HI> the Hou&s;e it &s;elf as well as the <HI>Three Farms</HI> had been &s;ettled on her near <HI>Kin&s;man</HI> Mr. WRIGHT, (a Man whom all the hone&s;t <HI>Tenants</HI> wi&s;hed to &s;ucceed her) as well in her Life, as in the time of her <HI>Predece&s;&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>To be &s;hort (as you mu&s;t needs know) a hazardous <HI>Suit</HI> commenced; and becau&s;e it &s;hould not lye too hard upon the Widow, ma|ny of her Friends became Parties to it. Ho|ne&s;t <HI>John Tru&s;ty,</HI> by general Con&s;ent was made chief Agent in the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> who the fir&s;t <HI>Term</HI> put the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Affairs in a good Po|&s;ture; and for &s;everal <HI>Terms</HI> following was continually gaining one Advantage or other over her Adver&s;aries; &s;o that they began now to &s;ue for <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> and a Meeting was appointed on both &s;ides, but refu&s;ing to allow &s;ufficient Co&s;ts and Damages, the <HI>Law</HI> went on.</P>
<P>In this promi&s;ing State &s;tood Affairs, when that furious <HI>Pulpiteer,</HI> the <HI>Curate</HI> of <HI>High-Ham,</HI> came to preach at <HI>Hockley,</HI> where ha|ving pack'd up a Sermon for the purpo&s;e, he infus'd Sedition among the <HI>Widow</HI>'s <HI>Tenants</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;tomers,</HI> in&s;inuating that &s;he began to &s;ell in <HI>&s;hort Mea&s;ure,</HI> Brew'd with <HI>Home-made Malt,</HI> and let her <HI>Lawyers, Book-keepers, O&s;t|lers, Chamberlain, Tap&s;ter, &amp;c.</HI> run away with what &s;hould pay the <HI>Exci&s;e.</HI> He in|veighed
<PB N="6" REF="5">
vehemently again&s;t the <HI>Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h,</HI> and other <HI>Heads</HI> of tke Town, for not repairing the CHURCH, one part of which he &s;aid was <HI>damaged</HI> and ready to <HI>fall;</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Conventicle</HI> was upheld by &s;ome about her, and a Parcel of <HI>GYPSIES</HI> kept privately in the <HI>Barn</HI> to eat her out of Hou&s;e and Home.</P>
<P>The Fellow had a good Talent at Railing, and could run on with as much Impudence as a Mountebank exhibits his Pacquet: In &s;hort the Poi&s;on worked &s;o &s;ubtly, that the whole Country was put in a Ferment. The Curate was taken up, and brought before the <HI>Bench of Ju&s;tices;</HI> where tho' he was repri|manded, and ordered to find Sureties for his <HI>Good Behaviour</HI> for 3 Years, yet it did not quiet the People, who cry'd out, <HI>The Church, the Church!</HI> and ran up and down in Tu|mults, as tho' it had been falling on their Heads; whil&s;t to &s;trengthen the matter, the <HI>Curate</HI> took a <HI>Journey</HI> round the Country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the People that the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> was haunted, and bid them take care how they came near it any more, directing them to the <HI REND="blackletterType">Pope</HI>'s <HI REND="blackletterType">Head</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">Dagger,</HI> near the <HI REND="blackletterType">Cro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>At this time one <HI>Robin Sly-boots,</HI> a <HI>Welch Button-maker,</HI> a notorious cunning Fellow, and fam'd for a <HI>Conjurer,</HI> who had formerly belonged to the Family, but was turned out, for making too bold with the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Secrets. This Fellow took his Opportunity to cor|rupt one of the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Maids, by pretending
<PB N="7" REF="6">
to tell her her Fortune, which &s;uch gigling Wenches are generally fond of; &s;o that taking her one Day, as &s;he was &s;weeping the Rooms, and making the Beds, he began in this manner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Nab,</HI> &s;ays he, I have often taken notice that thou art a Pains-taking, indu&s;trious Girl, and ha&s;t lived a great while in thy Service without coming to any Advance|ment. 'Tis true, you &s;weep the Rooms, make the Beds, and get a little &s;orry Vails of the <HI>Gue&s;ts,</HI> but 'tis Mrs. <HI>Sarah</HI> runs away with all the Profit, and keeps her whole Family at your Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es charge. But tho' &s;he now flouts the <HI>Widow,</HI> and flies and bounces like bottled Ale, thou &s;halt one day, if thou tak'&s;t my Advice, come to be as high as &s;he: Remember it, <HI>Nab,</HI> I &s;ay, thou &s;halt come to be a Lady."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ble&s;s me, &s;ays <HI>Nab,</HI> (with a &s;impering Countenance, knowing he had long had the Reputation of a Conjurer) is it po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould come to &s;uch Preferment as you &s;ay? That you may believe me, &s;ays <HI>Robin,</HI> go pre&s;ently, and look on the Bed in the <HI>Green Room,</HI> there lies a <HI>Calicoe Gown</HI> and <HI>Peticoat,</HI> lin'd thro' with the &s;ame; ask your Mi&s;tre&s;s for it, and &s;he will give it you. As you find this true, believe me in the re&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nab,</HI> no longer able to contain her &s;elf flung down her Be&s;om, and ran to the place, where finding it as he had &s;aid, &s;he returned overjoyed.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, Mr: <HI>Slyboots,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Nab,</HI> how is this thing to be effected? I'll tell you, &s;ays <HI>Robin,</HI>&mdash;At Midnight, when all things are quiet, you &s;hall plant me in &s;ome Cor|ner; and for the greater Solemnity I will have my <HI>Conjurers Gown</HI> on. You mu&s;t on your part infu&s;e &s;trange things into her Head, and tell her as many <HI>Tales</HI> as you can of the Servants. Then bring in &s;ome talk of the <HI>Curate;</HI> tell her what a good Man he is, and that he had always a great Re&s;pect for her; in&s;inuate that the De&s;ign of bring|ing him before the <HI>Bench of Ju&s;tices</HI> was to di&s;grace the <HI>Church;</HI> and that tho&s;e who were his Friends, &s;he may a&s;&s;ure her &s;elf are hers; and whil&s;t &s;he is mu&s;ing on the&s;e things, for I know it will work on her Re|ligious Spirit, I will appear, and then leave the re&s;t to me."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nab,</HI> in the mean time, had got the <HI>Gown</HI> and <HI>Peticoat</HI> which <HI>Robin</HI> &s;poke of, and was pretty &s;ure the re&s;t of his <HI>Predictions</HI> would follow. In fine, the <HI>Widow</HI> was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and deluded by <HI>Nab</HI>'s whining, and this <HI>Con|juring</HI> Ra&s;cal's Cant, that, tho' otherwi&s;e a Woman of Sen&s;e, &s;he grew perfectly en|flam'd, &s;o that without examining farther in|to the matter, giving Ear to <HI>Nab</HI>'s Tales, &s;he pre&s;ently began to Reform her Family; and a great many of the hone&s;te&s;t <HI>Tenants</HI> had warning given them again&s;t the next Quar|ter-day. However the <HI>Law-Suit</HI> continuing, they did not yet think fit to turn out hone&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>John</HI> the <HI>Agent,</HI> becau&s;e the taking the <HI>Papers</HI> out of his Hands might be dangerous to the <HI>CAUSE.</HI></P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, to make room for <HI>Robin, Ralph</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;h-keeper</HI> was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, a down|right hone&s;t Fellow, and had held his Place long with great Integrity, tho' many of her be&s;t <HI>Cu&s;tomers</HI> told her they would leave the Hou&s;e, and &s;tand by her no longer, if &s;he took the&s;e Cour&s;es. But all did not avail; every thing went as <HI>Robin</HI> advi&s;ed; in fine, &s;he turn'd away all her old hone&s;t Servants, di&s;|&s;olved the <HI>Club</HI> that was kept at her Hou&s;e, and none were held in favour, but &s;uch as had appeared to be Friends to the <HI>Curate,</HI> or were <HI>Robin</HI>'s Creatures. <HI>Robin</HI> was fir&s;t made <HI>Book-keeper</HI> and <HI>Under-Ca&s;h-keeper,</HI> and after <HI>Head-Ca&s;h-keeper,</HI> which was what he all along aim|ed at. He grew angry now at being called plain <HI>Robin,</HI> and nothing would go down but Mr. <HI>Slyboots</HI> at every word. He changed his Sign, which was before the <HI>Three Button-moles,</HI> and hung up in the room of it the <HI>Star</HI> and <HI>Garter</HI> finely painted, and had Vanity and Im|pudence enough to take the two <HI>Angels</HI> for <HI>Supporters</HI> to his <HI>Sign-Po&s;t.</HI> All that he &s;aid or did, if it may bear an old Pun, was <HI>Bob as a Robin;</HI> he brought in all his Friends, Fel|lows as poor as <HI>Howlets,</HI> to rule the Roa&s;t, and fill their hungry Bellies at the Widow's Table; &s;uch an avaritious Crew as were hard|ly worth hanging; a Medley of <HI>Welch Crate-Carriers, Pedlars,</HI> Retalers of <HI>Hob-nails, Brick|du&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
&amp;c. and among the re&s;t advanced <HI>Harry Aucumy,</HI> the Brazier, an audacious, lewd young Fellow, to be one of the <HI>Clerks of the Brew-hou&s;e.</HI> This was a docible young Dog for <HI>Robin</HI>'s Purpo&s;e, and by a pert way of &s;peaking in the <HI>Club,</HI> dexterou&s;ly advanc'd the Reputation of <HI>Robin</HI>'s Proceedings. In &s;hort, all went &s;wimmingly in the <HI>INN</HI> for a Year or two, and the Rogues with thriving Faces, care&s;&s;ed one another in their Iniquity.</P>
<P>But they found the <HI>Law-Suit</HI> began to hang heavy on their Hands; they had not the &s;ame Credit that the former Servants had to borrow Money, and they had none of their own to lend: The <HI>Rino</HI> was wanted to pay Fees, and the <HI>Tenants</HI> were very backward to advance more; &s;o that finding they were like to bring an old Hou&s;e upon their Heads if they went on, they were re&s;olved at any rate to come to an Accommodation; and <HI>Harry Aucumy</HI> was &s;ent privately to old <HI REND="blackletterType">Sa|vage</HI>'s Hou&s;e to treat about it, tho' they had &s;till told the <HI>Tenants</HI> it &s;hould be pu&s;h'd on <HI>vigorou&s;ly</HI> next <HI>Term,</HI> and con&s;tantly got Money out of them for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thinking their Bu&s;ine&s;s was now done, they put hone&s;t <HI>John Tru&s;ty</HI> out of the Agency, and like a Parcel of ungrateful Curs, &s;et their Black Guard to pelt him; but the hone&s;t Peo|ple of the Town could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing their Love in re&s;pect to his upright and judici|ous Dealing, by welcoming him Home with loud Acclamations, which fretted the Rogues
<PB N="11" REF="10">
to the Plucks to &s;ee him &s;o care&s;&s;ed, by who&s;e good <HI>Management</HI> the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> had been brought to that I&s;&s;ue, that <HI>Judgment</HI> was order'd to be enter'd up, and <HI>Execution</HI> would certain|ly have follow'd the very next <HI>Term.</HI> It will be tedious to relate all the intricate Pa&s;&s;ages of the Law, and how the Widow's Friends re&s;olv'd to carry the Cau&s;e on without her, but that <HI>Robin</HI> had ordered the new <HI>Agent Jacob Ru&s;h</HI> to &s;tifle many of the chief Wit|ne&s;&s;es, by which the Adver&s;ary's Attorney found means to &s;top Judgment.</P>
<P>To amu&s;e the <HI>Tenants,</HI> who they knew would be alarm'd at this Proceeding, it was given out, that the <HI>Widow</HI>'s <HI>Friends</HI> had not paid their &s;hare of the <HI>Law-Charges,</HI> but that all the <HI>Burden</HI> had lain upon her, which had run her grievou&s;ly in Debt, and that &s;he was in a manner forc'd to a Compo&s;ition, and had Offers now of a very good one, much to the Advantage of her &s;elf and her <HI>Friends.</HI> This took with the &s;illy People, and in &s;pight of all the Intreaties of her hone&s;t <HI>Tenants,</HI> an Agreement &s;oon followed, which however had taken up more Time and Money to effect, than would have decided it at <HI>Common-Law.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true we burnt our Faggot-&s;tacks, &s;et the Bells a ringing, and illumined our Win|dows, but we &s;oon experienc'd, that Humilia|tion would have become us better. The Hou&s;e lo&s;t its Trade, and no body in Town almo&s;t had any thing to do. People began to &s;ee into this, when it was too late, and no Remedy
<PB N="12" REF="11">
could be found to help them. Our <HI>old Friends</HI> exclaimed again&s;t us, as a treacherous and ba&s;e &s;ort of People, and &s;hun'd the Town, and our new ones apparently &s;lighted us, tho' we had done them &s;uch &s;ignal Service: Nor could we &s;o much as obtain to have the <HI>Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions</HI> kept here, tho' our Credit before u&s;ed to draw every Body to us.</P>
<P>They began to cavil now at the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Will in favour of Mr. WRIGHT, and tho' they dur&s;t not openly declare them&s;elves, yet 'tis known they were endeavouring to invei|gle the People into an Opinion of young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s Title, and di&s;pers'd <HI>Papers</HI> to prove it; nor did they u&s;e Mr. WRIGHT as tho' they ever expected he would come to the E&s;tate. All we could do was to wi&s;h them hang'd be|fore they &s;hould bring it to pa&s;s; for you mu&s;t know we hate the young Fellow hear|tily: His Father, Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> (if he was ho|ne&s;tly begot) u&s;ed us horribly, quarter'd Soldiers upon us, threaten'd our <HI>Charter,</HI> and play'd the Devil for God's &s;ake thro' the whole Country till we were fain to &s;end him packing; and 'tis very well known the young Rogue will never forgive us for't.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widow</HI> being to &s;end one to old <HI REND="blackletterType">Sa|vage</HI>'s to adju&s;t Accounts on the Accommoda|tion, who &s;hould the&s;e <HI>Achitophels</HI> advi&s;e her to but <HI>Jacob Booty,</HI> a notorious Friend to the Fa|mily of the <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s. This put us in &s;uch a Fright that we were ready to offer a Leg or Arm, out of every Family for Indemnity: For
<PB N="13" REF="12">
we &s;uppo&s;ed he could have no other <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> but to &s;trike up a Bargain at old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI>'s; but as it happened we had the good Fortune to &s;ee him die in a Ditch before he &s;et out, and &s;ave the H&mdash;n a labour, who&s;e Occupati|on, 'tis &s;aid, he had merited a few Years before by endeavouring to give the <HI>Young Gentleman</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>North</HI> Farm, with de&s;ign to burn and plunder it, if he could not hold it by Law.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every Day produced fre&s;h In&s;tances of our Misfortunes, and of the Villanies of tho&s;e who had betray'd us: Old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage,</HI> who be|fore we had reduced to be as poor as a <HI>Church Mou&s;e,</HI> &s;o that he lay even at our Mercy, be|gan to bully us again, re&s;erving many of the Conditions of the Agreement unexecuted. He demoli&s;hed a <HI>Turn-pike</HI> upon the <HI>River,</HI> which had been a great Annoyance to our <HI>Trade,</HI> but fallaciou&s;ly erected another a lit|tle nearer home, and eluded the chief Article of the <HI>Accommodation;</HI> he promi&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI> out of his Family, and with a mental Re&s;ervation only &s;ent him to board with one of his Tenants at next Door. More|over he engaged to u&s;e his Intere&s;t with young <HI>Savage</HI> his Grand&s;on in behalf of &s;ome <HI>Poor People</HI> that lay at his Mercy on account of &s;erving the <HI>Widow,</HI> who appear'd under a great concern for them, in&s;tead of which like an accompli&s;h'd <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> he &s;ent his <HI>Mirmi|dons</HI> and <HI>Bayliffs</HI> to haul them to <HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Every thing was acted with the &s;ame Can|dour, and &s;eem'd to be pulling on our Ruin, whil&s;t our <HI>Agents</HI> at home, out of the poor|ne&s;s of Spirit, dur&s;t not wag a Tongue, or a Finger again&s;t him, they lay &s;o open and &s;o expo&s;ed by the Rogueries he was privy to.

<P>It could not be expected that Men a&s;&s;ociated in Mi&s;chief &s;hould long agree among them|&s;elves, which Maxim 'tis very probable pro|duced the old Proverb; <HI>When</HI> R&mdash;s <HI>and</HI> W&mdash;s <HI>fall out hone&s;t Men come by their Goods.</HI> You may apply it as you plea&s;e; the u&s;e I &s;hall make of it is only to tell you that the Hou&s;e began to be divided again&s;t it&s;elf, and &s;o could not &s;tand long; <HI>Robin</HI> had now brought up a Bird to pick out his Eyes; his <HI>Pupil Harry</HI> had got the Start of him, and jock|eyed him out of the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Favour. <HI>Harry</HI> took up a Re&s;olution to &s;pur at all, <HI>aut Cae&s;ar aut nullus;</HI> but <HI>Robin,</HI> who had always a great Veneration for his Neck, was willing to jog on &s;oberly; <HI>Harry,</HI> out of the Vivacity of his Temper, told him, he was a Fellow of no Spi|rit,

and that his Cowardice quite baulk'd the Cau&s;e: Yes, &s;ays <HI>Robin,</HI> (very dryly) but it may be a means of &s;aving your Neck, if you take Example by it, and act with a little more Deliberation and Gravity. This in the end came to an open Rupture, &s;o that one Day a|bove the re&s;t they fell to it Pel mel before the <HI>Widow.

<P><HI>Sim</HI> the <HI>Scrivener</HI> put in a word on the &s;ame &s;ide, whom <HI>Robin</HI> took up very &s;martly.

<P>The <HI>Widow</HI> heard all this with a Mixture of Grief and Surprize; but above all &s;he won|dered to hear them talk of a better <HI>Compo&s;iti|on,</HI> when &s;he had all along been told, <HI>it was a very good one;</HI> &s;he plainly perceived now &s;he had been trick'd, e&s;pecially by <HI>Robin,</HI> who &s;he declar'd, <HI>had not told her one word of truth from the beginning;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Harry</HI> for the pre&s;ent &s;eem'd to carry his <HI>Point.

for as he was known to be very well affected to Mr. WRIGHT's Title, it &s;hewed her own Inclination thereto, by pitching on a Per&s;on &s;o very acceptable. This rejoic'd People &s;trangely, and the more, becau&s;e there had pa&s;&s;ed a current Rumour for &s;ome time, that they had been tampering with her to transfer the E&s;tate to young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute,</HI> after her Decea&s;e, contrary to Law. How true it is, God knows; but it &s;eems they were di&s;appointed. And I can a&s;&s;ure you &s;he told &s;ome of her Friends, that &s;he had often repented the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her old Ser|vants, who had &s;erved her faithfully, and given Content to her Cu&s;tomers; and if it plea&s;ed God to grant her Life and Health, &s;he would make a very great <HI>Alteration</HI> in Affairs.</P>
<P>But in &s;hort, what thro' the Grief and Fright &s;he had conceiv'd at their unmannerly Behaviour before her, and the Angui&s;h of a former Di&s;temper, it threw the Pain into her Head with &s;uch Violence, that it &s;oon put an end to her Life, for which the whole Town &s;hew'd a general Concern, and la|mented her as a pious, good, and charitable Woman, whom it may be truly &s;aid, <HI>they brought with Sorrow to the Grave.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after &s;he expir'd, the <HI>Tru|&s;tees</HI> took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Premi&s;es</HI> in Mr. WRIGHT's Name. I cannot de&s;cribe the infinite Joy on this Occa&s;ion, and that won|derful Satisfaction that appear'd in People's

Countenances: All was acted with that Calmne&s;s and Unanimity, that Cheerful|ne&s;s and Alacrity, as &s;eemed plainly to prog|no&s;ticate our future Good: No one was wanting to do his part; nay, even the <HI>Par|&s;on of the Pari&s;h,</HI> tho' crazy with Age and Infirmities, yet appear'd abroad that Day to countenance Mr. WRIGHT's Title, being one of the <HI>Feofees</HI> in <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> for him.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Harry Aucumy,</HI> indeed, appear'd un|der a very deep Pre&s;&s;ure of Mind; not &s;o much for the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Widow,</HI> as the &s;ole Power and Grandeur he conceiv'd him&s;elf fallen from, and the Inconveniences his pa&s;t Conduct might bring him into; for he knew in his Con&s;cience he &s;hould find it a difficult Matter to acquit him&s;elf hone&s;tly to Mr. WRIGHT.
