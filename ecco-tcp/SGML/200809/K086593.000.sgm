<L>How can I forget the fond hour</L>
<L>When Edward fir&s;t offer'd his heart?</L>
<L>At eve on the green, in the bow'r,</L>

<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be ju&s;tified, Marian. Your father's &s;u&s;picions, for I will not call 'em yours, have drawn from me a &s;ecret which the wealth of worlds &s;hou'd not! This picture he &s;hew'd you is the lively image of a mother, dear to me as the life-blood which warms my heart; and the money I &s;ent was to her.</P>

<P>Your kindne&s;s, Sir Henry, makes me &s;peak more of my&s;elf than I meant to do. My parents were both of good birth, but little indebted to fortune: my father died too young to provide for, and my mother retired on a &s;mall annuity to the banks of Tyne: unable to give me a learned education, &s;he gave me, in the noble&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, a liberal one; and in&s;pired me with her own and my father's virtues.</P>
