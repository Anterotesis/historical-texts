<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which introduces our Heroine to the Acquaintance of the Reader in no very advantageous Situation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT the middle of July, 17, when the Wind&s;or &s;tage-coach with the accu&s;tomed number of pa&s;&s;engers was proceeding on its way to London, a young woman genteely dre&s;&s;ed, with a &s;mall parcel tied up in her handkerchief, ha&s;tily bolted from the &s;helter of a large tree near the road; and, call|ing to the coachman to &s;top for a moment, a&s;ked him, if he could let her have a place? The man, although he well knew his vehicle was already &s;ufficiently crouded, yet being de|&s;irous of appropriating this &s;upernumerary fare to him&s;elf, replied, that he did not doubt but he could find room for her; and, jumping off his box, begged the company to &s;it clo&s;e, and give the young woman a place.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="11">"What do you mean?" &s;aid a jolly fat woman, with a face as red as &s;carlet,
<Q>Have you not got your u&s;ual number of pa&s;&s;engers? Do you think we will be &s;tifled with heat to put money into your pocket?</Q>
<Q>There is room enough for &s;uch a &s;lender young body as this,</Q>
&s;aid the coachman,
<Q>if you would but &s;it clo&s;er.</Q></P>
<P>"Sit clo&s;er!" repeated the dame, and, &s;pread|ing her cloaths,
<Q>Don't you &s;ee we are crouded to death: how dare you pretend to impo&s;e another pa&s;&s;enger upon us, when your coach is already full?</Q></P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid a tall lean woman, who &s;at next her,
<Q>This is the fir&s;t time I ever tra|velled in a &s;tage-coach, and truly I am &s;ick of it already. There is no bearing the in|&s;ults one is expo&s;ed to in the&s;e carriages. Prithee, young woman,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, with an air of great contempt,
<Q>Go about your bu|&s;ine&s;s, you &s;ee there is no room for you&mdash; And do you, fellow, get on your box, and drive on.</Q></P>
<P>"Fellow me! no fellows," &s;aid the coach|man, in a &s;urly tone,
<Q>I won't drive till I plea&s;e. Who are you, pray, that takes &s;o much upon you to order me?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12"><Q>Who am I, you &s;aucy Jack-a-napes, &s;aid the lady, a per&s;on that&mdash;but I &s;hall not demean my&s;elf &s;o much as to tell you who I am: it is my misfortune to be &s;tuffed up in a &s;tage-coach at pre&s;ent&mdash;what I have never been u&s;ed to, I a&s;&s;ure you.</Q></P>
<P>"Good lack-a-day!" &s;aid the fat gentle|woman, with a &s;neer,
<Q>A great misfortune truly&mdash; I would have you to know, madam, your betters ride in &s;tage-coaches. Here's a coil indeed with &s;uch would-be gentry.</Q></P>
<P>"Good woman," &s;aid the other, with an affected calmne&s;s,
<Q>Pray don't direct your im|pertinent di&s;cour&s;e to me, I have nothing to &s;ay to you.</Q></P>
<P>"No more a good woman than your&s;elf," &s;aid the plump lady, with a face doubly inflamed with rage; "I &s;corn your words."</P>
<P>"Very likely;" &s;aid a grave man, who &s;at on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide,
<Q>but I wi&s;h it was po&s;&s;i|ble to make room for the young gentle|woman</Q>
&mdash; "Ah! God ble&s;s your honour,"
<Q>&s;aid the coachman, I thought you could not find in your heart to let &s;uch a pretty young woman as this walk.</Q></P>
<P>"Pretty!" exclaimed the haughty lady&mdash;
<Q>You are a fine judge of beauty indeed&mdash; but I will not &s;ubmit to be crouded, fellow: &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="13">
you and your pretty pa&s;&s;enger may ride on the coach-box, if you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"Nay, &s;ince you come to that," &s;ays the fat gentlewoman,
<Q>I am re&s;olved you &s;hall not have your own way&mdash; The young lady may be as good as you; and &s;he &s;hall not be obliged to ride on the coach-box&mdash; So open the door, coachman,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, &s;hoving her antagoni&s;t at the &s;ame time with all her force&mdash;"Here is room enough."</P>
<P>A young gentlewoman in a riding-habit, who &s;at on the &s;ame &s;ide, but next the window, de|clared that &s;he was willing to give part of her &s;eat to the &s;tranger; and begged the haughty lady to yield. "Poh," &s;aid the ro&s;y matron,
<Q>don't &s;tand begging and praying her; &s;ince you are on my &s;ide, we will be too hard for her, I warrant you.</Q>
Saying this, &s;he put one of her huge arms round the young woman's wai&s;t; and thus reinforced, &s;hoved her neigh|bour &s;o forcibly again&s;t the other window, that &s;he cried out with pain and vexation.</P>
<P>The young lady without, who had been the occa&s;ion of this conte&s;t, and who had hitherto &s;tood &s;ilent, with her hat over her eyes, alarmed by the &s;creams of her foe, rai&s;ed her head; and in a tone of voice &s;o &s;weet, as immediately fixed the attention of the whole company, in|treated
<PB N="5" REF="14">
them not to quarrel upon her account: it was indeed, &s;he &s;aid, of great con&s;equence to her to be admitted, but &s;he would not con|tinue to de&s;ire it, &s;ince her reque&s;t had pro|duced &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s among them.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;engers who occupied the other &s;ide of the coach were two men and a woman big with child; which circum&s;tance had made it impo&s;&s;ible for the men to offer her a &s;eat with them, for fear of incommoding the pregnant woman. But the younge&s;t of the men having now got a glimp&s;e of the &s;tranger's face, declared that the ladies might make them&s;elves ea&s;y, for he would re&s;ign his &s;eat; adding, that he was extremely glad he had an opportunity of obliging &s;uch a hand&s;ome lady. He then jumped out of the coach, and taking the &s;tranger's hand to help her in, &s;tared confidently under her hat, which put her into a little confu&s;ion: however &s;he thanked him very politely, and accepted his offer; but not without expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome con|cern for the manner in which he would di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Oh! madam," &s;aid the coachman,
<Q>the gentleman may &s;it upon the box with me, and he will have the plea&s;ure of viewing the beau|tiful pro&s;pects all the way we go.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>I &s;hall &s;ee none &s;o beautiful,</Q>
&s;aid the young fellow,
<Q><PB N="6" REF="15">as what they who remain in the coach will behold.</Q></P>
<P>The fair &s;tranger now blu&s;hed more than before, and being willing to avoid any farther &s;peeches of this nature, &s;he ha&s;tily got into the coach, thanked the young man a &s;econd time, who having &s;een her &s;eated, placed him&s;elf by the coachman on the box, and they proceeded on their journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The commencement of a violent friend&s;hip between two young ladies, which has the u&s;ual con&s;equences, a communication of &s;ecrets, by which the reader is let into part of Henrietta's &s;tory.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Profound &s;ilence now prevailed among the company in the coach; the eyes of all were fa&s;tened upon the fair &s;tranger, who ap|peared wholly in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;crutinizing looks of her fellow-travellers. Something within her&s;elf &s;eemed to engro&s;s all her thoughts, and although by her eyes being con&s;tantly turned to|wards the windows of the coach, it might be imagined the pa&s;&s;ing objects drew her atten|tion, yet their fixed looks too plainly indicated that they were beheld without ob&s;ervation. Her
<PB N="7" REF="16">
per&s;on, though full of charms, and the ea&s;y gracefulne&s;s of her air, impre&s;&s;ed le&s;s re&s;pect for her on the minds of the women, than the ele|gance of her morning-dre&s;s, which they were now at lei&s;ure to con&s;ider. Her gown was a white &s;prig'd mu&s;lin, extremely fine, through which &s;hone a rich blue Mantua &s;ilk petticoat: her cap, handkerchief, and ruffles were trimmed with fine Bru&s;&s;els lace: her apron had a broad border round it of Dre&s;den work; and a white lute&s;tring hat &s;haded her charming face, which &s;he was &s;olicitous to conceal from view.</P>
<P>The melancholy with which &s;he &s;eemed op|pre&s;&s;ed, conciliated to her the good will of her female fellow-travellers, though from very dif|ferent &s;entiments. The haughty lady, who had refu&s;ed to let her have a place in the coach, found her envy and ill-nature in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ub&s;ide, by the con&s;ideration that this &s;tranger was pro|bably more unhappy than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The lu&s;ty matron, plea&s;ed that by in&s;i&s;ting upon receiving her, &s;he had conferred an obli|gation on one who appeared to be of a rank above her own, enjoyed her pre&s;ent &s;uperiority, and pitied her from the overflowings of gratified pride.</P>
<P>The young lady in the riding-habit, who&s;e vanity had been a little mortified at &s;eeing her|&s;elf
<PB N="8" REF="17">
a&s;&s;ociated in a journey with per&s;ons whom &s;he conceived to be very unfit company for her, thought her&s;elf very happy in the acqui&s;ition of &s;o genteel a fellow-traveller; and as &s;he had not deign'd to open her mouth before, from an opinion of the meanne&s;s of her company, &s;he now made her&s;elf amends for her &s;ilence, by addre&s;&s;ing a profu&s;ion of civil &s;peeches to the fair &s;tranger, who replied to every thing &s;he &s;aid with extreme politene&s;s, but with an all that &s;howed her heart was not at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;engers being &s;et down at different places, mi&s;s Courteney, for that was the name of our fair adventurer, remained alone with the young lady in the coach. This circum&s;tance &s;eemed to rouze her from a deep revery, in which &s;he had been wholly ab&s;orbed during the la&s;t half hour; and looking earne&s;tly at her companion, "Ah! madam, &s;aid &s;he," in a mo&s;t affecting accent, "and when am I to lo&s;e you?" "I &s;hall leave you in a few minutes," &s;aid the lady;
<Q>for I am going no farther than Ham|mer&s;mith.</Q>
"Lord ble&s;s me!" &s;aid mi&s;s Cour|teney, li&s;ting up her fine eyes &s;wimming in tears,
<Q>What &s;hall I do? what will become of me?</Q></P>
<P>This exclamation gave great &s;urprize to the other lady, who from &s;everal circum&s;tances had
<PB N="9" REF="18">
conceived there was &s;ome my&s;tery in her ca&s;e. "You &s;eem unea&s;y," &s;aid &s;he to mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>pray let me know if it be in my power to &s;erve you.</Q></P>
<P>This kind reque&s;t had &s;uch an effect on the tender heart of mi&s;s Courteney, that &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and for a few moments was unable to an&s;wer; when the lady pre&s;&s;ing her to &s;peak freely, "I am an unhappy creature, madam, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ighing;
<Q>and am flying from the only per&s;on in the world upon whom I have any de|pendence. I will make no &s;cruple to tru&s;t you with my &s;ecret. Did you ever hear of lady Meadows,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>the widow of Sir John Meadows?</Q></P>
<P>"I know a lady who is acquainted with her," &s;aid the other,
<Q>&s;he is a woman of fa&s;hion and fortune.</Q></P>
<P>"Lady Meadows is my relation," re&s;umed mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>&s;he took me, a poor helple&s;s orphan, under her protection, and during &s;ome time treated me with the tenderne&s;s of a mo|ther. Within the&s;e few weeks I have unhap|pily lo&s;t her favour, not by any fault of mine, I a&s;&s;ure you, for I have always loved and re|verenced her. Nothing &s;hould have obliged me to take this &s;tep, which has no doubt an
<PB N="10" REF="19">
appearance of ingratitude, but the fear of being forced to marry a man I hate.</Q></P>
<P>"O heavens! my dear creature," exclaimed the lady,
<Q>What do you tell me! were you upon the point of being forced to a dete&s;ted match?</Q>
"I was, madam," replied mi&s;s Cour|teney;
<Q>and to this hard lot was I doomed by her to whom I owe all my pa&s;t happine&s;s, and from whom I expected all the future.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have obliged me exce&s;&s;ively by this unre&s;erved confidence,</Q>
interrupted the lady;
<Q>and you &s;hall find me not unworthy of it. From this moment I &s;wear to you an invio|lable attachment. Sure there is nothing &s;o tran&s;porting as friend&s;hip and mutual confi|dence. Yon won my heart the moment I &s;aw you. I have formed a hundred violent friend&s;hips, but one accident or other al|ways di&s;&s;olved them in a &s;hort time. There are very few per&s;ons that are capable of a violent friend&s;hip; at lea&s;t I never could find one that an&s;wered my ideas of that &s;ort of en|gagement. Have not you been often di&s;ap|pointed? tell me, my dear: I dare &s;ay you have. Your &s;entiments, I believe, are as delicate as mine upon this head. I am charmed, I am ravi&s;hed with this meeting. Who would have imagined that by chance,
<PB N="11" REF="20">
and in a &s;tage-coach, I &s;hould have found what I have &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ought for the&s;e three months, a per&s;on with whom I could contract a violent friend&s;hip, &s;uch as minds like our's are only capable of feeling.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am extremely obliged to you, madam, for your good opinion,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s, Courteney;
<Q>I hope I &s;hall never be &s;o unfortunate as to for|feit it; indeed I have rea&s;on to think that in my pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, a friend is a ble&s;&s;ing &s;ent from heaven.</Q></P>
<P>"Well! but my dear Clelia," &s;aid this flighty lady,
<Q>you have not told me all your &s;tory&mdash; I call you Clelia, becau&s;e you know it is &s;o like common acquaintance to addre&s;s one an|other by the title of Mi&s;s &s;uch a one&mdash; Ro|mantick names give a &s;pirit to the corre&s;|pondence between &s;uch friends as you and I are; but perhaps you may like another name better than Clelia; though I think that is a mighty pretty one, &s;o &s;oft and gliding, Clelia, Clelia&mdash; tell me do you like it, my dear?</Q></P>
<P>"Call me what you plea&s;e," &s;aid mi&s;s Cour|teney, &s;miling a little at the &s;ingularity of her new friend; "but my name is Courteney."</P>
<P>"Courteney is a very pretty &s;irname," &s;aid the lady;
<Q>I hope it is not di&s;graced with any
<PB N="12" REF="21">
odious vulgar chri&s;tian name, &s;uch as Molly, or Betty, or the like.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was chri&s;tened Henrietta, after my mo|ther,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney.
<Q>Henrietta is well enough&mdash;returned the other; but po&s;itively, my dear, you mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume the name of Cle|lia when you write to me; for we mu&s;t cor|re&s;pond every hour&mdash;Oh! what a ravi&s;hing plea&s;ure is it to indulge the overflowings of one's heart upon paper! Remember to call me Celinda in your letters; and in all our private conver&s;ations, we &s;hall have a thou|&s;and &s;ecrets to communicate to each other. But I am impatient to know all your &s;tory; it mu&s;t needs be very romantick and pretty.</Q></P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid the charming Henrietta,
<Q>this is no time to relate my misfortunes; we are entered into Hammer&s;mith, and there you &s;ay you mu&s;t leave me: give me your advice, dear madam, as to the manner in which I mu&s;t di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>"<HI>Dear madam,</HI>" repeated the lady&mdash;
<Q>is that the &s;tyle then you re&s;olve to u&s;e; have you forgot that we have contracted a violent friend|&s;hip, and that I am your Celinda, and you my Clelia.</Q></P>
<P>"I beg your pardon," &s;aid Henrietta;
<Q>I did not think of that name: well then, dear Ce|linda,
<PB N="13" REF="22">
what would you advi&s;e me to do? I am going to London, there to conceal my&s;elf from the &s;earch that lady Meadows will doubt|le&s;s make for me when &s;he hears I have left her hou&s;e: all my hope of a reconciliation with her is through the interpo&s;ition of a friend. I have a brother, who has been abroad the&s;e ten years, and whom I every day expect to hear is arrived; but I dare not &s;how my&s;elf to any of lady Meadows's acquaintance, le&s;t I &s;hould be hurried back, and &s;acrificed to what &s;he calls my intere&s;t. I know &s;o little of the town, that I am afraid I may take up my re&s;idence in an improper hou&s;e, among people where my honour, or at lea&s;t my re|putation, may be in danger. Direct me, dear madam&mdash; My dear Celinda, I would &s;ay, direct me what to do in this dreadful di|lemma.</Q>
Here &s;he pau&s;ed, anxiou&s;ly expect|ing the an&s;wer of her new friend, which will be found in the following chapter.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which illu&s;trates an ob&s;ervation of Rochefoucault's, that in the misfortunes of our friends there is al|ways &s;omething that does not di&s;plea&s;e us.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"I Prote&s;t, my deare&s;t Clelia," &s;aid the lady,
<Q>your fears are very natural upon this oc|ca&s;ion. I &s;hould in your &s;ituation be almo&s;t di&s;tracted. Even our parents' watchful cares are hardly &s;ufficient to guard us again&s;t the attempts of in&s;olent men: how much more then are tho&s;e attempts to be dreaded, when we are left defencele&s;s and expo&s;ed. Believe me, my dear, I &s;ympathize truly with you in this misfortune. Good Heaven! I think I &s;hould die with apprehen&s;ion were I in your ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"Dont terrify me," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, trembling.
<Q>I have taken an imprudent &s;tep, but I mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it now: Provi|dence, I hope, will be my guard.</Q></P>
<P>"I would not terrify you, my dear," &s;aid the lady;
<Q>but I mu&s;t repeat, that were I in your ca&s;e, I think my fears would dictract me. Thank Heaven? I am protected by watchful parents, cautious relations, and prudent friends;

yet hardly thus can I think my&s;elf &s;ecure from the&s;e enterpri&s;ing wretches the men.</Q></P>
<P>This young lady had indeed a &s;tronger pro|tector than, all the&s;e, which &s;he did not mention, or perhaps was in&s;en&s;ible of; and that was the extreme di&s;agreeablene&s;s of her whole per&s;on. Her features, it is true, could not be called ir|regular, becau&s;e; few faces were ever di&s;tin|gui&s;hed with a &s;et more uniformly bad. Her complexion, which was a compo&s;ition of green and yellow, was marvelou&s;ly well &s;uited to her features. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible to make any invi|dious compari&s;ons between her face and her &s;hape, &s;ince it was hard to decide which was wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney, who had bur&s;t into tears, occa&s;ioned by her reflections on her own help|le&s;s &s;ituation, compared with the advantages her friend enjoyed, and which &s;he had &s;o often|tatiou&s;ly enumerated, was upon the point of &s;o|liciting her advice again; when the lady joy|fully exclaimed,
<Q>Oh! there is my aunt's hou&s;e, my dear Clelia, we mu&s;t part imme|diately.</Q></P>
<P>"Sure," &s;aid Henrietta, &s;ighing,
<Q>you will not leave me till you have advi&s;ed me what to do.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25">"Lord! my dear," &s;aid the other,
<Q>one young creature is not qualified to give another ad|vice upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. I wi&s;h it was in my power to give you proper advice; you know I have vowed to you an inviolable friend&s;hip.</Q>
And, &mdash;</P>
<P>Here the coachman, as he had been direct|ed, &s;topped before a large hand&s;ome hou&s;e; and a well-dre&s;&s;ed footman immediately ap|pearing, came forwards to open the coach|door.</P>
<P>"Hear me one word," cried mi&s;s Courteney, perceiving this tender friend was actually going to leave her without any farther &s;olicitude for her &s;afety &mdash;
<Q>upon the &s;trength of that invio|lable friend&s;hip you have vowed to me, I will venture to a&s;k a favour of you: it is, pur&s;ued &s;he, that you will recommend me to &s;ome per&s;on of your acquaintance in London, who may direct me to a decent hou&s;e, where I can remain in &s;afety till my brother's arrival.</Q></P>
<P>"I vow this is a lucky thought," &s;aid the lady;
<Q>I believe I can &s;erve you, my dear Clelia; but you mu&s;t &s;tep in with me to my aunt's. John,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he to the &s;ervant,
<Q>is my aunt at home.</Q>
The man told her his lady was ju&s;t gone to take an airing.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="26">"That's well," &s;aid the lady;
<Q>we &s;hall have an opportunity to &s;ettle this matter: but, my dear Clelia, I think it will be be&s;t to di&s;charge the coach, the fellow po&s;&s;ibly will not wait. I'll &s;end my aunt's &s;ervant to take a place for you in the Hammer&s;mith &s;tage, which I know does not &s;et out this half hour.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta readily complied, overjoyed that &s;he had really found a &s;incere friend in the per&s;on of this whim&s;ical lady; who, having led her into a large well-furni&s;hed parlour, ordered &s;ome tea to be brought, and then told her, that &s;he would give her a letter to her millener, who was a very good &s;ort of a woman, and where &s;he might depend upon being ab&s;olutely &s;afe.</P>
<P>"When I was la&s;t in town," pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>which was about three weeks ago, her fir&s;t floor was empty; and in this &s;ea&s;on of the year, I believe &s;he will let it to you for two guineas a week.</Q></P>
<P>"A &s;ingle room will do for me," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>my circum&s;tances do not entitle me to magnificent lodgings, and my bu&s;ine&s;s is to keep my&s;elf private.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, well, my dear, be that as you plea&s;e," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid the other;
<Q>I will write the letter with|out mentioning what lodgings you require.</Q>
<PB N="18" REF="27">
Saying this, &s;he called for pens and paper; and having wrote the following billet, gave it to mi&s;s Courteney for her peru&s;al.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mrs. EGRET,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE lady who will deliver you this, is one for whom I have the mo&s;t violent friend|&s;hip imaginable. You know how ardent my friend&s;hips are; but I think I never had any &s;o firmly rooted as this, though our acquaint|ance commenced but a few hours ago. This dear friend having de&s;ired me to recommend her to &s;ome per&s;on to lodge with, I thought of you, knowing you can accommodate her with genteel apartments.I am, dear Mrs Egret,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your humble &s;ervant, E. WOODBY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Henrietta having read the letter, returned it again into the hands of her friend, grate|fully acknowledging the favour, although &s;he had &s;ome objections to it; for &s;he did not ap|prove of the words genteel apartments, being re&s;olved not to exceed a very moderate price: but &s;he rightly conceived that mi&s;s Woodby ra|ther li&s;tened to her own pride than her conve|niency,
<PB N="19" REF="28">
by throwing in that circum&s;tance, and therefore took no notice of it.</P>
<P>The letter being &s;ealed and directed, mi&s;s Courteney carefully depo&s;ited it in her pocket, and the two ladies were preparing to drink their tea, when the footman entered, and &s;aid the &s;tage|coach was ju&s;t going off: our fair traveller in|&s;tantly ro&s;e up, and took leave of her friend, who having prevailed upon her to drink a gla&s;s of &s;ack and water, &s;ince &s;he was di&s;appointed of her tea, parted with her with an affectionate em|brace, and a promi&s;e that &s;he would &s;ee her in town very &s;hortly.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney finding only one pa&s;&s;enger in the coach, who was a grave elderly woman, &s;he re&s;umed her journey with &s;ome kind of chearful|ne&s;s, having thus happily got over her appre|hen&s;ions of falling into bad company, where chance might have directed her to lodge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our heroine, through inattention, falls into the very difficulty &s;he had taken &s;uch pains to avoid.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT this ce&s;&s;ation from unea&s;ine&s;s did not la&s;t long: for the mind which can fa&s;ten with violence but upon one circum&s;tance of di&s;|tre&s;s at a time, and being &s;uddenly relieved from that, is &s;en&s;ible of a calm, which, compared with its former feelings, may be called plea&s;ure, yet &s;oon &s;elects another object to engro&s;s its attention, and fixes on it with equal anxiety and &s;ollicitude. Thus it fared with our lovely heroine, who&s;e others cares had all been &s;wallowed up in re|flections on the danger to which her honour was expo&s;ed. Ea&s;ed of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions by the good offices of mi&s;s Woodby, &s;he was happy for a few moments, till the con&s;equences of her flight ru&s;h'd full upon her mind: lady Meadows's favour irrecoverable; her fortune ruined; her reputation bla&s;ted. This la&s;t thought, which, from the delicacy of her &s;entiments, gave her the deepe&s;t regret, dwelt mo&s;t upon her mind; and forgetting that &s;he was not alone, &s;he cla&s;ped
<PB N="21" REF="30">
her hands together in a violent emotion, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>The old gentlewoman, who had been eyeing her very attentively, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s that appeared in the looks and beha|viour of &s;o young a creature, eagerly a&s;ked her, What was the matter?</P>
<P>Henrietta, rouzed by this que&s;tion, which, (&s;o ab&s;ent had &s;he been) fir&s;t informed her &s;he was ob&s;erved, wiped her eyes, and compo&s;ing her countenance, &s;aid &s;he was often low-&s;pi|rited.</P>
<P>"Don't tell me of low &s;pirits," &s;aid the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entlewoman,
<Q>&s;uch young bodies as you are not low-&s;pirited for nothing. What! I war|rant you, there is a &s;weetheart in the ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! no, madam," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;hing, "no &s;weetheart, I a&s;&s;ure you."</P>
<P>"No, really," re&s;umed &s;he;
<Q>well then, I &s;uppo&s;e you have lo&s;t a friend.</Q></P>
<P>"I have indeed lo&s;t a friend," &s;aid the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy; hoping that acknowledgment would put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> end to the que&s;tions of her fellow-traveller.</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid the old woman; "and this friend &mdash; is it a father, or mother, or &s;i&s;ter, or &mdash;</P>
<P>All, all," interrupted mi&s;s Courteney; bur&s;t|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g again into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31">"How all?" repeated the old woman.
<Q>Have you ju&s;t now lo&s;t all the&s;e relations?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I lo&s;t them all in lo&s;ing that friend, ma|dam,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta; vexed that her &s;en&s;ibi|lity, wakened by &s;uch que&s;tions, had made her too little guarded in her expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"Oh, Oh, I under&s;tand you, child," &s;aid the good gentlewomen:
<Q>this per&s;on, I don't a&s;k you whether it was a man or woman, was to you both father and mother. Well; and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e you have ju&s;t heard of the death of this good friend, and are going to town on that occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney finding that the inqui&s;itive temper of her fellow-traveller was likely to lead her into a di&s;covery of her &s;ituation, cho&s;e ra|ther to be &s;ilent than violate truth, by feigning circum&s;tances, to deceive her; and, fortunately for her, &s;he was prevented from &s;uffering more di&s;agreeable interrogatories, by the coach &s;ud|denly &s;topping at an inn in Piccadilly, where it put up.</P>
<P>The old gentlewoman, however, at parting, a&s;ked her what part of the town &s;he was going to, and offered, if it was in her way, to accom|pany her; but Henrietta evaded the que&s;tion and the offer, by telling her, that &s;he &s;hould take a chair. The coachman accordingly called one
<PB N="23" REF="32">
for her, which &s;he entered immediately; and being a&s;ked by the chairman where &s;he would plea&s;e to be carried? &s;he recollected with great confu&s;ion, that mi&s;s Woodby had not told her where her millener lived.</P>
<P>She now &s;ought for the letter, hoping there was a full direction upon that. But what was her grief and perplexity, when &s;he found the &s;uper&s;cription contained only the&s;e words
<Q>For Mrs. Egret.</Q>
"Good Heaven!" exclaimed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fair unfortunate, "what &s;hall I do now?</P>
<P>The chairman repeating his que&s;tion; &s;he told him that &s;he had forgot a direction, and a&s;ked him, if he knew where Mrs. Egret, a millener, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ved?

<P>The girl de&s;ired her to walk into a parlour, where &s;he was met by an agreeable well-dre&s;&s;ed woman, who received her with great politene&s;s, and de&s;ired to know her commands.</P>
<P>"I have a letter for you," &s;aid Henrietta, putting it into her hands,
<Q>from a young lady, a cu&s;tomer of your's, the contents will ac|quaint you with my bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The millener took the letter, and having read it, returned it again with a &s;mile, &s;aying,
<Q>She was not the per&s;on to whom it was ad|dre&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>"No! madam," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, exce&s;|&s;ively &s;urpri&s;ed, "Is not your name Egret?</P>
<P>"My name is Eccles, madam," &s;aid the millener. "Ble&s;s me!" cried mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>the chairmen have made a mi&s;take: I bid one of them enquire where Mrs. Egret, a millener, lived, and he was directed hither. I &s;hall be obliged to you, pur&s;ued Henrietta, if you will let your maid call a chair.</Q></P>
<P>"To be &s;ure, madam," &s;aid the millener;
<Q>but do you not know where this Mrs. Egret lives?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have unfortunately forgot to get a direc|tion,</Q>
returned the young lady;
<Q>but I hope you can inform me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="36">"I wi&s;h I could, madam," &s;aid the millener; "but really I know no &s;uch per&s;on as Mrs. Egret."
<Q>Surely I am the mo&s;t unfortunate creature in the world!</Q>
cried Henrietta.</P>
<P>"I hope not, madam," &s;aid Mrs. Eccles, with a look of great complacency:
<Q>there are more per&s;ons, be&s;ides Mrs. Egret, who would be glad to accommodate you with lodgings. I wi&s;h mine were good enough for you.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! I dare &s;ay they are good enough," re|plied mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>but I was recommended to Mrs. Egret, and&mdash;</Q>
<Q>Pray, madam, walk up, and look at my fir&s;t floor,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Eccles; and, without waiting for any reply, im|mediately led the way.</P>
<P>Henrietta followed in &s;uch perplexity of mind, that &s;he hardly knew what &s;he did; and, while the officious millener led her from room to room, expatiating at large upon the conveniencies, mi&s;s Courteney continued &s;ilent, revolving in her thoughts the dilemma to which &s;he was re|duced.</P>
<P>The evening was &s;o far advanced, that &s;he could not think of going in que&s;t of Mrs. Egret, of whom &s;he could get no information here; yet &s;he was not able to re&s;olve upon taking lodg|ings in the hou&s;e of a per&s;on, to whom &s;he was an ab&s;olute &s;tranger: a misfortune which &s;he had
<PB N="26" REF="37">
vainly endeavoured to avoid by the application &s;he had made to mi&s;s Woodby.</P>
<P><Q>I am afraid you don't like this apartment, madam,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Eccles; who ob&s;erved her look pen&s;ive and unea&s;y.
<Q>I have no objec|tion to it,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>but that it is rather too good. I do not propo&s;e to go to a high price; a bedchamber and the u&s;e of a parlour will be &s;ufficient for me.</Q></P>
<P>The millener looked a little di&s;&s;atisfied at the&s;e words, but told her &s;he could accommo+date her with a large hand&s;ome bedchamber up two pair of &s;tairs, but added, that &s;he had no other parlour than that which &s;he kept for her own u&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney de&s;ired to &s;ee the room, which was indeed very hand&s;ome and convenient; and the millener perceiving &s;he liked it, told her, that &s;he &s;hould be welcome to the u&s;e of the dining-room till her fir&s;t floor was let.</P>
<P>The young lady thought this an obliging propo&s;al; and being plea&s;ed with the woman's countenance and behaviour, ventured to make an agreement with her, and every thing being &s;ettled upon very ea&s;y terms,
<Q>there is but one difficulty remaining,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, with an en|gaging &s;mile,
<Q>and that I know not how we &s;hall get over; we are &s;trangers to each other.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="38">"Oh, madam," interrupted Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>though it is not my cu&s;tom to take in lodgers without having a character, yet I can have no &s;cruple with regard to a lady of your ap|pearance. As for me, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed a great many years in this neighbourhood, and am not afraid of having my character enquired into.</Q></P>
<P>She &s;poke this with a little warmth, which made Henrietta imagine &s;he expected the &s;ame degree of confidence &s;he had &s;hown: &s;o making a merit of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;he appeared very well &s;ati&s;|fied, and immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her new apartment.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>YOU will no doubt, my dear mi&s;s Woodby, be both &s;urpri&s;ed and grieved to know that your kind intentions have been fru&s;trated; and that by forgetting to give me a direction, your recommendation to Mrs. Egret has proved u&s;e|le&s;s to me. By a mi&s;take of the chairman, who I de&s;ired to enquire where Mrs. Egret lived, I was brought to another millener's, and &s;he not being able to direct me where to find her, I am obliged to take up my lodging with a &s;tranger. It was my apprehen&s;ions of what has befallen me, that induced me to tru&s;t you with my &s;ecret, a &s;ecret of the highe&s;t importance to me; and mo&s;t generou&s;ly did you repay my confidence by your ready a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.

</LETTER>
<P>Henrietta had ju&s;t &s;ealed her letter, when &s;omebody tapp'd at her door; &s;he opened it im|mediately, and, &s;eeing Mrs. Eccles, a&s;ked her pardon for not waiting on her before. Mrs. Eccles told her, that her little &s;upper being ready, &s;he came to &s;ee if &s;he was at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney found the cloth laid in the parlour, and an elegant &s;upper was &s;erved up. Mrs. Eccles did not fail to apologize frequently for the meanne&s;s of her entertainment, and was gratified with as many a&s;&s;urances from her fair gue&s;t, that no apology was nece&s;&s;ary. During the repa&s;t, Mrs. Eccles entertained her with an account of the newe&s;t fa&s;hions, the mo&s;t ce|lebrated performers of the opera and playhou&s;es, little pieces or &s;candal, and the like topicks of
<PB N="30" REF="41">
conver&s;ation, which Henrietta had often heard di&s;cu&s;&s;ed among her more polite acquaintance, and indeed almo&s;t the only ones that engage the attention during the rece&s;s of the card-table.</P>
<P>The millener then turning the di&s;cour&s;e to the accident that procured her &s;o agreeable a lodger, artfully pur&s;ued her hints till the young lady found her&s;elf obliged to &s;atisfy in &s;ome degree her cu|rio&s;ity concerning her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Though &s;he was naturally communicative, even to a fault; yet &s;he did not think proper to di&s;clo&s;e her&s;elf farther, than to tell her, that &s;he had been obliged to come to London upon &s;ome affairs of con&s;equence, which could not be &s;ettled till the arrival of her brother, who was every day expected from his travels.</P>
<P>This account was &s;o near the truth, that mi&s;s Courteney, in the &s;implicity of her own heart, thought it could not fail of being believed. How|ever, the millener, who knew the world very well, conceived there was &s;omething extraor|dinary in the ca&s;e&mdash; nothing le&s;s than a love-intrigue: nor did this &s;u&s;picion give her any un|ea&s;ine&s;s. She was one of tho&s;e convenient per|&s;ons with whom a lady, upon paying a certain &s;um of money, might lie-in privately, and be properly attended. She made no &s;cruple of ac|commodating with lodgings a young wife, who&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="42">
hu&s;band, for certain family rea&s;ons, vi&s;its her only now and then; and as &s;he generally &s;ound her account in &s;uch &s;ort of lodgers, &s;he &s;eldom de|&s;ired, and indeed was &s;eldom encumbered with any other.</P>
<P>The youth, beauty, and elegance of mi&s;s Courteney, the introductory letter &s;o oddly con|ceived, her apparent perplexity and concern upon her di&s;appointment of the lodgings &s;he had ex|pected, rai&s;ed &s;u&s;picions, which the &s;tory &s;he now heard, confirmed; and not doubting but this af|fair would prove beneficial to her, &s;he exerted her utmo&s;t endeavours to plea&s;e her fair lodger, and engage her to an entire confidence.</P>
<P>When the clock &s;truck eleven, Henrietta ro&s;e up in order to retire to her own chamber, to which Mrs. Eccles officiou&s;ly attended her; having taken leave of her at the door, &s;he bolted it on the in|&s;ide, and, after recommending her&s;elf to the protection of Heaven, went to bed, but not to re&s;t. A thou&s;and di&s;quietudes kept her waking till the morning, when &s;he &s;unk into a &s;lumber that la&s;ted till eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he opened her eyes, &s;he was in|formed, by the &s;trong light in her chamber, that the morning was far advanced; and, finding by her watch, which lay on a chair near her bed-&s;ide, how much &s;he had exceeded her u&s;ual time (for

&s;he was a very early ri&s;er) &s;he hurried on her cloaths, and went down &s;tairs, being extremely anxious to get her letter &s;ent to mi&s;s Woodby: &s;he went directly into the &s;hop, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he &s;hould find Mrs. Eccles there; but was exce&s;|&s;ively &s;urpri&s;ed to hear from the apprentice, that her mi&s;tre&s;s was not yet up.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>&s;he re&s;ted no better than my&s;elf la&s;t night, which was the cau&s;e of my lying &s;o late this morning.</Q></P>
<P>"La! ma'am," replied the girl,
<Q>my mi&s;|tre&s;s is never up before eleven or twelve.</Q>
"Indeed!" &s;aid the young lady, di&s;&s;embling her concern at a circum&s;tance which gave her no favourable opinion of her landlady.
<Q>But, madam,</Q>
added the girl,
<Q>you may have your breakfa&s;t whenever you plea&s;e to order it.</Q>
She then called the maid, whom mi&s;s Courteney ordered to fetch a porter, being de|termined to have her letter delivered into mi&s;s Woodby's own hands, if po&s;&s;ible. A porter was &s;oon found, who undertook to carry the letter to Hammer&s;mith as directed, and this affair being di&s;patched, Henrietta ordered &s;ome coffee for her breakfa&s;t, and retired to her own chamber.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which mi&s;s Woodby again makes her appearance.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN about a quarter of an hour, Mrs. Eccles appeared, in a long loo&s;e linen &s;ack, being her morning dre&s;s, and in&s;i&s;ted upon mi&s;s Cour|teney's breakfa&s;ting with her; who at length con&s;ented, having agreed to pay at the rate of a guinea a week for her board, during the time &s;he &s;tayed, which &s;he inly determined &s;hould not be long.</P>
<P>After the tea-things were removed, &s;he went into the &s;hop to make a purcha&s;e of &s;ome rib|bons and gloves; and while &s;he was amu&s;ing her&s;elf with looking over a great variety of fa|&s;hionable trifles, which the apprentice offici|ou&s;ly &s;hewed her, a young gentleman, who had been attracted by her appearance, came into the &s;hop, and a&s;ked to look at &s;ome Dre&s;den ruffles. Henrietta, blu&s;hing at the earne&s;tne&s;s with which he gazed on her, retired immediately, telling Mrs. Eccles, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through the parlour, that there was a gentleman in the &s;hop. The millener, upon this information, lifted up her hands mechanically to her head to adju&s;t her hair,
<PB N="34" REF="45">
and ha&s;tened to attend her cu&s;tomer; while her fair lodger, taking a book that lay in the window, went to her own apartment, with an intention to amu&s;e her&s;elf with reading till the long'd-for return of her me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>The book however, which was a volume of the new Atalantis, did not &s;uit her ta&s;te; &s;he threw it away, and abandoned her&s;elf to her own me|lancholy reflections, which were at length inter|rupted by her landlady, who entered the room with a &s;miling air, telling her, &s;he had had a very good cu&s;tomer.</P>
<P>"I am glad of it," &s;aid Henrietta.</P>
<P>"Truly," &s;aid Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>I believe I am obliged to your fair face for my good luck this morning.</Q>
"How!&mdash;" returned the young lady, with a countenance graver than before.</P>
<P>"Nay, never wonder at it," &s;aid Mrs. Eccles,"
<Q>the gentleman laid out twelve guineas with me; but I don't believe he wanted the things he bought. You were the load&s;tone,</Q>
added &s;he &s;martly,
<Q>that drew him into the &s;hop. &mdash;He a&s;ked me a hundred que&s;tions about you.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;orry for it," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, "I wi&s;h I had not been in the &s;hop."
<Q>And why &s;orry, pray,</Q>
re&s;umed Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>I warrant you are &s;orry you are hand&s;ome too&mdash;
<PB N="35" REF="46">
However, I have another thing to tell you, to increa&s;e your &s;orrow, and that is, that you have certainly made a conque&s;t of this fine &s;park; and, to overwhelm you with afflic|tion,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, laughing,
<Q>I verily be|lieve he is a man of quality.</Q></P>
<P>"Do you know him then," &s;aid mi&s;s Cour|teney; who could not help &s;miling a little at her vivacity.</P>
<P><Q>I only judge by his appearance and man|ners,</Q>
replied Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>that he is a man of rank; but I dare &s;ay, we &s;hall hear more from him.</Q>
"Sure&mdash; Mrs. Eccles!" interrupted mi&s;s Courteney, with &s;ome emo|tion.</P>
<P>"Nay, nay, child," exclaimed Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>don't put your&s;elf into a flurry; I don't know that I &s;hall ever &s;ee him again&mdash; But, pray what book have you got here?</Q>
<Q>One I found in your parlour,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney. "Oh, I &s;ee what it is," cried Mrs. Eccles, opening it;
<Q>it is a charming pretty book. If you love reading, mi&s;s, I can furni&s;h you with books; I have a very pretty collection&mdash; I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee your collection,</Q>
&s;aid the young lady, who was apprehen&s;ive of her re|newing a conver&s;ation that had been very di&s;|agreeable to her.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="47">Mrs. Eccles immediately led her into a little room on the &s;ame floor, and opening a clo&s;et, in which there were about two dozen books ranged on a &s;helf, &s;he bid her take her choice, for there was variety enough.</P>
<P>Henrietta &s;oon examined the &s;o much boa&s;ted collection, which &s;he found chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of novels and plays. "Well," &s;aid Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>how do you like my books? are they not prettily cho&s;en?</Q></P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you," replied &s;he, taking down one,
<Q>you cho&s;e very well when you cho&s;e this; for it is one of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pieces of humour in our language.</Q>
<Q>I knew you would approve of my ta&s;te,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>but what have you got?&mdash; O! the Adven|tures of Jo&s;eph Andrews &mdash; Yes; that is a very pretty book, to be &s;ure!&mdash; but there is Mrs. Haywood's Novels, did you ever read them?&mdash; Oh! they are the fine&s;t love-&s;ick, pa&s;&s;ionate &s;tories; I a&s;&s;ure you, you'll like them va&s;tly: pray, take a volume of Haywood upon my recommendation.</Q>
"Excu&s;e me," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>I am very well &s;atisfied with what I have; I have read this book three times already, and yet I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hall begin it again with as much eagerne&s;s and de|light as I did at fir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="48">"Well, as you plea&s;e," &s;aid Mrs. Eccles, leaving her at the door of her own chamber,
<Q>I won't di&s;turb you till dinner is ready.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney &s;at down to her book, which agreeably engaged her attention, till &s;he was in|terrupted with the plea&s;ing news of her porter's being returned: &s;he flew down &s;tairs; he deli|vered her a letter, the &s;eal of which &s;he eagerly broke, and found it as follows.</P>

<P>The hopes of &s;eeing her friend, and being &s;ettled in more agreeable lodgings, gave Hen|rietta
<PB N="38" REF="49">
&s;uch a flow of &s;pirits, that when &s;he was &s;ummoned to dinner by her landlady, &s;he ap|peared le&s;s re&s;erved than u&s;ual, and even kept up the conver&s;ation with &s;ome kind of chearful|ne&s;s. Mrs. Eccles, finding her in &s;o good a humour, introduced the &s;ubject which ran mo&s;t in her head&mdash;The fine young gentleman, who had been her cu&s;tomer in the morning, was prai&s;ed in raptures of admiration&mdash; &s;o genteel, &s;o well bred&mdash; &s;uch &s;parkling eyes, &s;uch an air of di&s;tinction&mdash; Every now and then exclaim|ing&mdash;

<P>Mi&s;s Courteney, to put an end to this di&s;|cour&s;e, told her landlady, that &s;he expected a lady to drink tea with her that afternoon; Mrs. Eccles immediately gave orders for the dining-room to be put in order, and thither mi&s;s Cour|teney retired in expectation of her vi&s;iter. At &s;ix o'clock a footman's rap at the door anounced the arrival of mi&s;s Woodby; Henrietta ran to the head of the &s;tairs to receive her.</P>
<P>"O Heavens! my dear creature" cried mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>What trouble have I been in upon your account!&mdash; but even the di&s;quiets of friend&s;hip are plea&s;ing; I would not be in&s;en|&s;ible

of that charming pa&s;&s;ion, nor without an object of it for the world.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney thanked her in very obliging terms, while her &s;entimental friend adju&s;ted her dre&s;s in the gla&s;s, and then throwing her&s;elf into a chair, declared that &s;he was all impatience to hear her hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"Permit me," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>to in|form you fir&s;t, that I am not ea&s;y here, I do not greatly like my landlady, and I wi&s;h I could remove this very night.</Q>
Mi&s;s Woodby told her it was impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e &s;he had not yet &s;een Mrs. Egret, but that &s;he would go to her in the morning, and prepare her for her coming. Henrietta, being now at ea&s;e, com|plied with her friend's reque&s;t, and began her little hi&s;tory in this manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Henrietta relates the &s;tory of her parents, introductory to her own.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>IT is no wonder, my dear mi&s;s Woodby, that at the&s;e early years I am precipitated into di&s;tre&s;&s;es and dangers; my very birth was a misfortune to my parents, and intailed upon them tho&s;e mi&s;eries which began by their unhappy pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My father was the younge&s;t of three bro|thers, but &s;o great a favourite of his father the earl of &mdash;, that it was thought he would make his fortune very con&s;iderable, having a very large e&s;tate, and a very lucrative employ|ment, out of which he every year laid by large &s;ums to provide for his younger &s;ons, of whom my father, as I have already &s;aid, was the be&s;t beloved.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It happened one day, that the widow of an officer in the army came to &s;olicit the earl's intere&s;t towards getting her a pen&s;ion. She was accompanied by her daughter, a young woman about &s;ixteen years of age, and who mu&s;t at that time have been exqui&s;itely hand&s;ome, &s;ince, after a long &s;eries of trou|bles,
<PB N="41" REF="52">
and in an age more advanced, &s;he ap|peared to me one of the mo&s;t beautiful women in the world.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The widow, by a certain method of per|&s;ua&s;ion which operates powerfully on the do|me&s;ticks of men in place, got her petition &s;ent up to the earl. It imported that her hu&s;band, after having &s;erved near fifty years in the army, had obtained leave to &s;ell his commi&s;|&s;ion for the benefit of his wife and child; that the money ari&s;ing from it had been de|po&s;ited in the hands of an agent who had broke a few months afterwards, by which unhappy accident all the money was lo&s;t, and this lo&s;s had &s;o greatly affected the old gentle|man, that he died a few weeks afterwards, leaving his wife and child wholly unprovided for, and made wretched by tho&s;e very means that were calculated to &s;ecure them a gen|teel &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;ince by the &s;ale of her hu&s;|band's commi&s;&s;ion, the widow was no longer intitled to a pen&s;ion, which however &s;he hoped to obtain, in con&s;ideration of his long &s;er|vices, and the peculiar circum&s;tances of her misfortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The widow, who knew it was in this no|bleman's power to put her immediately upon the li&s;t of pen&s;ions, conceived great hopes of
<PB N="42" REF="53">
the &s;ucce&s;s of her application, when, after waiting two hours in the hall, &s;he was or|dered to atttend his lord&s;hip in his li|brary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The nobleman received her with civility enough; but his fir&s;t words de&s;troyed tho&s;e expectations with which &s;he had flattered her|&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry it is not in my power to do you any &s;ervice, &s;aid he; your hu&s;band &s;old out, therefore you have no right to the pen&s;ion. I pity your misfortune; but in this ca&s;e there is nothing to be done.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The widow was a woman of &s;en&s;e and breeding: &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that the earl paid no regard to her plea, otherwi&s;e he would not have urged that as an argument again&s;t granting her petition, without which no peti|tion would have been nece&s;&s;ary: intreaties &s;he found would be fruitle&s;s, therefore &s;he would not de&s;cend to the meanne&s;s of a &s;up|pliant, but curt&s;y'd in &s;ilent angui&s;h, and withdrew.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My father, who was pre&s;ent at this &s;cene, and who had beheld the decent &s;orrow of the mother with reverence, the innocent beauty of the daughter with tender admiration, im|pelled by an emotion which yet he knew not
<PB N="43" REF="54">
the cau&s;e of, ha&s;tily followed them, and of|fered his hand to the widow to lead her down &s;tairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She, who from a natural dignity of &s;enti|ment, had been enabled to endure the &s;uper|cilious behaviour of the father without be|traying any &s;igns of di&s;compo&s;ure, bur&s;t into tears at this in&s;tance of unexpected attention and re&s;pect in the &s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney, as he led her down &s;tairs, had his eyes ince&s;&s;antly turned towards the young lady, who followed blu&s;hing to &s;ee her&s;elf &s;o earne&s;tly beheld. He found they had not a coach waiting for them, he or|dered a &s;ervant to call one; and in the mean time de&s;ired they would walk into a parlour, where he took occa&s;ion to expre&s;s his concern to the widow for the di&s;appointment &s;he had met with; but a&s;&s;ured her, that he would employ his good offices in her favour, and from the influence he had over his father, hoped he &s;hould &s;ucceed. He then de&s;ired to know where he might wait upon her, in ca&s;e he had any good news to bring her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The widow, charmed with his politene&s;s, a&s;toni&s;hed at his kindne&s;s, and full of hope and plea&s;ing expectation, gave him a direction in writing, which &s;he had brought with her.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="55">
<Q>Mr. Courteney received it, bowing low, as if &s;he had conferred a favour on him; a favour it was indeed, for, by this time, he was lo&s;t in love for the charming daughter, who&s;e looks di&s;covered &s;uch &s;oft &s;en&s;ibility of her &s;ituation, &s;uch con&s;cious dignity, which misfortune could not impair; &s;uch calm re&s;ig|nation, as if, &s;uperior to her woes, that her beauty &s;eemed her lea&s;t perfection; and he was more captivated by the graces of her mind that &s;hone out in her per&s;on, than with her lovely per&s;on it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The coach was now come; he &s;ighed when he took leave of them, rivetting his eyes on the young charmer, who mode&s;tly looked down, unable to bear his ardent glances. Again be a&s;&s;ured the widow of his &s;ervices; and, &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he put a pur&s;e into her hand, begging her to accept that trifle as an earne&s;t of his friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The lady was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at his be|haviour, that &s;he was at a lo&s;s in what manner to an&s;wer him; and, before &s;he could form any, &s;he found her&s;elf in the coach, to which he had accompanied her with great re&s;pect. When the coach drove from the door, &s;he exa|mined the contents of the pur&s;e, and found five and twenty guineas in it: a pre&s;ent, which, if it
<PB N="45" REF="56">
had been le&s;s, would have mortified her pride, and, being &s;o con&s;iderable, alarmed her pru|dence. She recollected every circum&s;tance of the young gentleman's behaviour, and all con|tributed to per&s;uade her, that he was actuated by &s;ome motive more forcible than mere com|pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She remembered that &s;he had caught him gazing earne&s;tly at her daughter; &s;he reproach|ed her&s;elf for taking her with her, for accept|ing the money, for giving a direction. She dreaded the con&s;equence of having expo&s;ed her child to the attempts of a young man formed to plea&s;e, and by his rank and fortune enabled to pur&s;ue every method that could gratify his pa&s;&s;ions. She began now to be &s;olicitous about the effect &s;uch uncommon genero&s;ity had on the mind of her daughter. She a&s;ked her what &s;he thought of the gentleman who &s;o kindly intere&s;ted him&s;elf in their affairs, notwith&s;tanding the cruel denial his father had given?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mi&s;s, who&s;e gratitude had with difficulty been re&s;trained from ri&s;ing from her heart to her tongue, eagerly &s;eized this opportunity to prai&s;e their benefactor. Her expre&s;&s;ions were &s;o lively, &s;he &s;howed &s;o tender a &s;en&s;ibility of his kindne&s;s, &s;uch a blu&s;hing approbation
<PB N="46" REF="57">
of his per&s;on and manners, that the good widow thought proper to check her vivacity by a little reproof, and attributed all the re|&s;pect he had &s;hown them to his natural polite|ne&s;s, and his offers of &s;ervice, and the pre&s;ent he had forced on her, to a &s;udden &s;ally of compa&s;&s;ion which young unexperienced per|&s;ons are liable to. However, her apprehen|&s;ions were now increa&s;ed; and when Mr. Courteney came to &s;ee her, in con&s;equence of his promi&s;e, which was two days after wards, &s;he had already taken her re&s;olution.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She took care that her daughter &s;hould not be in the way when he &s;ent up his name; and notwith&s;tanding the politene&s;s with which he acco&s;ted her, &s;he ob&s;erved that he was di&s;|appointed, and that his eyes involuntarily &s;ought out an object which he more wi&s;hed to &s;ee than her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I don't know whether the&s;e little particu|lars may not &s;eem tedious to you, my dear mi&s;s Woodby; but I have often heard my mother repeat them with delight; declaring that the&s;e fir&s;t tokens of my father's affection for her made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart, fluctuating, as it then was, between hope and fear, that &s;he ever retained the mo&s;t lively remembrance of them, and could never
<PB N="47" REF="58">
relate them without feeling in &s;ome degree the &s;ame plea&s;ing emotions with which &s;he was at that time agitated.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney began the conver&s;ation with a&s;&s;uring the widow, that he had been mindful of her affairs; that his &s;olicitations had not yet indeed had the de&s;ired effect; but that he hoped &s;hortly to bring her better news. The widow thanked him with great politene&s;s for his kind interpo&s;ition in her favour, which &s;he declared would always have a claim to her &s;incere&s;t gratitude, whether he &s;ucceeded or not in his applications. She then drew the pur&s;e out of her pocket, and putting it re&s;pect|fully into his hands, told him, that not being in any immediate nece&s;&s;ity, &s;he begged he would not take it ill if &s;he declined accepting a pre&s;ent which would lay her under an unre|turnable obligation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney blu&s;hed with &s;urprize and di&s;appoimment&mdash; but the dignity with which &s;he looked and &s;poke, making it impo&s;&s;ible for him to pre&s;s her any farther, he received the money back again with a low bow, apo|logizing at the &s;ame time for the liberty he had taken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The widow, &s;eeing him di&s;concerted, po|litely recommended her intere&s;ts to him; and
<PB N="48" REF="59">
Mr. Courteney, charmed that &s;he would allow him to be her friend on any terms, retired with a promi&s;e that he would take as much care of them as of his own.</Q></P>
<P>"This interview," continued Henrietta,
<Q>confirmed the widow in her &s;u&s;picions, that her daughter was not indifferent to their new benefactor&mdash; He had ob&s;erved her &s;crupulous re&s;erve with regard to the young beauty, and hoped to remove it by affecting a total neg|lect of her; &s;o that he did not even enquire how &s;he did.&mdash; Whatever is done with de|&s;ign is always overdone: the widow was per|&s;uaded that a man of Mr. Courteney's good breeding would not have pa&s;&s;ed over one of the common forms of politene&s;s, but to an|&s;wer &s;ome &s;ecret purpo&s;e. Her vigilance in|crea&s;ed in proportion to her fears; and al|though he made her &s;everal vi&s;its under pre|tence of enquiring more minutely into the circum&s;tances of her ca&s;e, yet he never was &s;o fortunate as to find her daughter with her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This conduct, while it &s;timulated his pa&s;|&s;ion, gave him a high opinion of the virtue and prudence of her, who, in &s;uch unhappy circum&s;tances, &s;howed &s;uch extreme attention to the honour and reputation of her child Hitherto he had not been at the trouble to
<PB N="49" REF="60">
examine his own views and de&s;igns upon this young beauty. Hurried away by the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, he had a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;ought op|portunities of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with her; but the difficulties he met with made him look into his own heart, that he might know if he was &s;till &s;ufficient ma&s;ter of it to give over a pur&s;uit which was likely to prove fruitle&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Amazed to find that what he took for a tran&s;ient inclination, was a pa&s;&s;ion immove|ably fixed; that he had formed re&s;olutions, when he believed he had only entertained de|&s;ires; that the whole happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of his life was in the power of a young woman, de&s;titute of friends, fortune, hopes and expec|tations, and rich only in beauty and virtue&mdash; for virtuous he was &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t be, under the care of &s;o wi&s;e and prudent a mother. He was alarmed at his own condition; dreaded the con&s;equences of a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o placed as that it could never procure the &s;anction of his fa|ther's con&s;ent, and re&s;olved never more to ex|po&s;e him&s;elf to the danger of &s;eeing her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>However, he did not fail to &s;olicit his fa|ther very earne&s;tly in behalf of the unfortunate widow. The carl, who had taken notice of his officious re&s;pect the day &s;he was introduced to him, and attributed it rather to the beauty

<P><Q>Mr. Courteney was obliged to be &s;ilent, le&s;t he &s;hould confirm tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions which he &s;aw his father had conceived; and finding his mind in a very unea&s;y &s;tate, he hoped that, by removing him&s;elf to a greater di&s;tance from the object he loved, he &s;hould remove the thoughts of her likewi&s;e; he obtained his fa|ther's content to his retiring for a few weeks to their &s;eat in the country, under pretence of a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition; but he could not re|&s;olve to go without endeavouring once more to force a pre&s;ent upon the widow, which might prevent her being expo&s;ed to any di&s;tre&s;s during his ab&s;ence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He therefore wrote to her, and acquaint|ing her with the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his mediation with his father, expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t concern for it, and a&s;&s;ured her that nothing could al|leviate it but her acceptance of the bank note which he inclo&s;ed, and which was for fifty pounds: he told her, he was going into the country, that &s;he might not &s;uppo&s;e he had any de&s;ign of inducing her by &s;uch a pre&s;ent

to admit his vi&s;its; and concluded with a&s;|&s;uring her, that &s;he might at all times com|mand his &s;ervices, and rely on his friend|&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He did not &s;end away this letter till he was ready to take hor&s;e; and being now more compo&s;ed, from the belief that he had &s;ilenced the &s;cruples of this good woman, and &s;ecured her and her lovely daughter from any imme|diate nece&s;&s;ity, he pur&s;ued his journey&mdash; full of plea&s;ing reflections on the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his love.</Q></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>ABSENCE (&s;ays a certain writer) in|crea&s;es violent pa&s;&s;ions, and cures mo|derate ones; ju&s;t as the wind extingui&s;hes a &s;mall flame, while it makes a great one burn more fiercely. Mr. Courteney's pa&s;&s;ion was of this kind; he had loved with violence from the moment he began to love. In vain he had recour&s;e to books, to company, to field &s;ports, and rural amu&s;ements; it was not po&s;|&s;ible for him to call off his thoughts a moment from that object from whom he fled with &s;uch
<PB N="52" REF="63">
care. Two months he wore away in a con|&s;tant perturbation of mind, &s;till flattering him|&s;elf that he was nearer his cure, while his di&s;|ea&s;e gathered &s;trength every day.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It happened that one evening he fell into company with &s;ome officers, who&s;e regiment was quartered in that part of the country; and one of them mentioned colonel Carlton, and the unhappy &s;ituation his widow and daughter were left in.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney, rouzed to attention by that name &s;o dear to him, pretended to be wholly ignorant of tho&s;e ladies ca&s;e, that be might indulge him&s;elf in the plea&s;ure of talking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her he loved.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The officer gave him a circum&s;tantial de|tail of what he knew as well as him&s;elf; con|cluding with many commendations of Mrs. Carlton's good &s;en&s;e, prudence, and virtue; and &s;uch rapturous prai&s;es of the young lady's beauty and uncommon qualifications at &s;uch early years, that Mr. Courteney, for the fir&s;t time &s;en&s;ible of the tortures of jealou&s;y, could with difficulty conceal his emotions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;peak &s;o feelingly, &s;aid a gentleman i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> company, of this young lady's perfections, that I fancy you are in love with her: come, he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is her health; is it to be a match&punc;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="64">
<Q>I &s;hould be but too happy in &s;uch a wife, replied the officer; but &s;he de&s;erves a better hu&s;band: it is not for a poor lieutenant, added he, &s;miling, to marry for love; but if I was a man of fortune, I would prefer mi&s;s Carl|ton to all the women I have ever &s;een.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney afterwards declared that he &s;uffered inconceivable angui&s;h during this con|ver&s;ation. He quitted the company with &s;ome precipitation; and when he was at liberty to reflect, he reproached him&s;elf a thou&s;and times for his folly in leaving &s;uch a trea&s;ure for an|other to obtain. Every man he thought would look upon mi&s;s Carlton with the &s;ame eyes as that young officer; and among them might not one be found ble&s;t with a fortune to make her happy, and above all narrow con|&s;iderations which could hinder him from mak|ing him&s;elf &s;o?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olutions are ea&s;ily formed when the heart &s;ugge&s;ts them. Mr. Courteney, who had &s;o long fluctuated between his pa&s;&s;ion and his prudence, was, by the fear of lo&s;ing what he loved, determined in an in&s;tant to put it pa&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of lo&s;ing her. His father's anger, which at fir&s;t appeared &s;o formidable to him, was now con&s;idered as a trifle that would be ea&s;ily got over: he was not going
<PB N="54" REF="65">
to introduce any &s;tale mi&s;tre&s;s into a noble family, nor to give a comedian or &s;inger for a &s;i&s;ter to his &s;i&s;ters, and a daughter to his mo|ther; alliances &s;o much in fa&s;hion with the pre&s;ent race of nobility and people of fortune: in mi&s;s Carlton he &s;hould marry birth, beauty, virtue, every perfection but riches, but un|happily that, in the e&s;timation of his father, was worth them all.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His fortune indeed was undetermined; it might be great, it might be very incon&s;idera|ble, &s;ince it depended upon the will of his father. His father would never con&s;ent to his marriage with mi&s;s Carlton; but though di&s;|obliged, yet loving him as he did, was it likely that he would always continue inexorable! Be&s;ides he had a certain, though a remote pro|&s;pect of a good e&s;tate, to which he was to &s;ucceed at the death of a relation, who was old, and had been married twenty years without having ever had a child.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Should he find it impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile his father to his marriage, yet he was &s;ecure at lea&s;t of a genteel provi&s;ion; but with &s;uch ex|cellencies as mi&s;s Carlton was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, how could it be imagined that &s;he &s;hould not in time conciliate his father's affections, and make him approve of his choice?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="66">
<Q>There is no logick, my dear mi&s;s Woodby, like the logick of the heart. Mr. Courteney, as is u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, having taken his re&s;olution before he rea&s;oned upon the matter, rea&s;oned afterwards in &s;uch a manner as to be &s;oon per&s;uaded his re&s;olution was right.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Early the next morning he ordered his hor&s;es to be made ready, and he returned to London with all imaginable expedition. He alighted at the hou&s;e of a friend, where he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants and hor&s;es, and then taking a hackney coach, was driven to the &s;treet in which Mrs. Carlton lived. Upon &s;topping at the hou&s;e, and enquiring for Mrs. Carlton, he was told that &s;he had left it five weeks ago, and being greatly indi&s;po&s;ed, had taken lodg|ings at Chel&s;ea for the air.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney, who now thought every moment an age till he &s;aw mi&s;s Carlton, and acquainted her with his pa&s;&s;ion and his honourable intentions, procured as full a di|rection as could be given him; but notwith|&s;tanding his impatience to be with his mi&s;|tre&s;s, he obeyed the dictates of his duty, in fir&s;t going home to pay his re&s;pects to his father.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="67">
<Q>The earl received him a little coldly; an expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ure was on his counte|nance, which however wore off by degrees, as he enquired concerning his health, his &s;tudies and amu&s;ements, during his ab&s;ence. At length &s;eeming to recollect &s;omething, he went to his cabinet, took out a letter, the &s;eal of which had been broke, and delivered it into his &s;on's hand, a&s;&s;uming the &s;ame angry coun|tenance as before.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney, not able to imagine what all this meant, opened the letter ha&s;tily, and found it was from Mrs. Carlton, dated the very day of his departure, and in it was in|clo&s;ed the bank note he had &s;ent: the purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her letter was to refu&s;e in a genteel but &s;teady manner all pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him; however &s;he thanked him for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|lities, and acknowledged her&s;elf greatly obliged to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When Mr. Courteney had read this letter, which he did with much confu&s;ion, the ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;ked him &s;ternly, what was his de&s;ign by en|gaging in &s;uch a commerce? You are in love with the daughter, added he, no doubt &mdash;but if you corrupt her, you are not an ho|ne&s;t man; if you marry her, you are no longer my &s;on.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="68">
<Q>He left him as he pronounced the&s;e words; and Mr. Courteney, who, while he beheld it at a di&s;tance, thought his father's di&s;plea&s;ure might be borne with, was overwhelmed with the fir&s;t effects of it, and relap&s;ed into all his for|mer doubts, anxiety, and irre&s;olution.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He retired to his own chamber to con&s;ider on what he ought to do; but unable to bear the cruel war which &s;uch contrary intere&s;ts, &s;uch oppo&s;ite wi&s;hes, &s;uch perplexed de&s;igns, rai&s;ed in his mind, he hurried out of the hou&s;e to lo&s;e reflection in a variety of objects, and took his way to the Park.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He walked down the Mall, it was crouded with company which did not in the lea&s;t en|gage his attention; he continued his walk, and, finding him&s;elf at Buckingham-gate, his &s;teps mechanically pur&s;ued the road that led to Chel&s;ea.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as he &s;aw him&s;elf near the place where his mi&s;tre&s;s re&s;ided, all other thoughts were ab&s;orbed in the tran&s;porting reflection, that he &s;hould &s;ee her within a few moments; his father's threats were forgot, the lo&s;s of his &s;avour filled him with no unea&s;y apprehen|&s;ions. To how many revolutions is the hu|man mind &s;ubject, when pa&s;&s;ion has a&s;&s;umed the reins of government which rea&s;on ought
<PB N="58" REF="69">
to hold! Mr. Courteney had almo&s;t imper|ceptibly to him&s;elf re&s;umed his fir&s;t de&s;ign of offering his hand to mi&s;s Carlton.</Q></P>
<P><Q>With very little difficulty he found out the hou&s;e where her mother and &s;he lodged; the door was opened to him by a girl, who, upon his enquiring if Mrs. Carlton was at home, told him &s;he was &s;ick in bed, and, &s;howing him into a little parlour, ran up &s;tairs to ac|quaint mi&s;s, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, that a gentleman was there.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In a few minutes a venerable old woman appeared, who had &s;o fixed a concern upon her countenance, that Mr. Courteney, &s;hift|ing his thoughts from the illne&s;s of the mo|ther to the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome po&s;&s;ible mi&s;|fortune to the daughter, for love if it hopes all, fears all likewi&s;e, a&s;ked her with great emo|tion, if any thing extraordinary had happened to the ladies?</Q></P>
<P><Q>The good woman, plea&s;ed with his &s;olici|tude, which &s;he thought promi&s;ed &s;ome re|lief, told him plainly, that Mrs. Carlton was in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; that &s;he had been ill &s;everal weeks; that &s;he had not been able to procure proper advice; and added &s;he, bur&s;t|ing into tears, &s;he has even wanted common nece&s;&s;aries.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="70">
<Q>O my God! exclaimed Mr. Courteney, with a deep &s;igh; but mi&s;s&mdash;what is become of mi&s;s? Alas! &s;ir, replied the old woman, the dear child is almo&s;t dead with fatigue and grief; &s;he has watched by her mother the&s;e ten nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, there is no per&s;uading her to quit her for a moment. I left her in an agony of &s;orrow, for it is believed poor Mrs. Carlton cannot live three days.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Conduct me to her, cried Mr. Courteney eagerly; I may po&s;&s;ibly be able to comfort her; let me &s;ee her, I conjure you, imme|diately.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Stay a moment, &s;ir, &s;aid the old woman, &s;topping him, for he was making towards the door; I will go up fir&s;t and inform the ladies. There is no occa&s;ion for that, &s;aid Mr. Cour|teney, Mrs. Carlton knows me very well; &s;he will not I am &s;ure be &s;orry to &s;ee me, I have &s;omething to &s;ay to her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The good woman, &s;eeing his ob&s;tinacy, permitted him to follow her up &s;tairs; &s;he gently opened the chamber-door, and, ap|proaching the bed where the &s;ick lady lay, told her there was a friend of her's, who de|&s;ired to &s;ee her. Mr. Courteney entered that moment, and beheld a &s;ight which called for
<PB N="60" REF="71">
more fortitude than he was at that time po|&s;e&s;&s;ed of to &s;upport without tears.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mrs. Carlton lay extended on her bed, &s;up|ported by a heighth of cu&s;hions to facilitate her breathing, which &s;he &s;eemed to do with great difficulty. Death appeared in her lan|guid countenance; and an expre&s;&s;ion of the tender angui&s;h of a mother for the child whom &s;he was &s;o &s;oon to leave expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of a barbarous world, mixed with the pious re&s;ignation of a chri&s;tian, was impre&s;&s;ed in every line of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Her daughter was kneeling at the bed-&s;ide, and held one of her mother's hands, which &s;he was bending over in an agony of grief: upon hearing what the old woman &s;aid, &s;he rai&s;ed her head; and, directing her &s;tream|ing eyes to the place where Mr. Courteney &s;tood, &s;howed him a face pale, emaciated, but lovely &s;till; at &s;ight of him a faint blu&s;h over&s;pread her cheeks. It is Mr. Courteney, my dear mamma, &s;aid &s;he.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! &s;ir, &s;aid Mrs. Carlton, perceiving him, you are very good to &s;eek out affliction thus. I &s;hall &s;hortly be pa&s;t all my cares; but what will become of this poor helple&s;s orphan? The tears that &s;treamed from her eyes prevented her further utterance.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="72">
<Q>Mr. Courteney threw him&s;elf on his knees at the bed-&s;ide, and almo&s;t &s;obbing with the violence of his emotions at this affecting lan|guage, Oh! madam, &s;aid he, What mu&s;t you not have &s;uffered? why would you not accept what little a&s;&s;i&s;tance it was in my power to offer you. I know your delicate &s;cruples&mdash; I come to beg you will give your&s;elf a right to all my future &s;ervices&mdash; I have &s;omething to communicate to you&mdash; But, added he, look|ing at the old woman who had introduced him, we are not alone.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Speak freely, &s;ir, &s;aid Mrs. Carlton, this good woman is my daughter's nur&s;e; &s;he knows all my affairs; I am much indebted to her kindne&s;s and affection for my child.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What I have to &s;ay, proceeded Mr. Cour|teney, relates to that dear, that lovely daugh|ter: I loved her from the fir&s;t moment I &s;aw her; &s;uch innocence, &s;uch beauty, could not &s;ugge&s;t any impure de&s;ire. As &s;oon as I knew the force of my pa&s;&s;ion, which ab&s;ence fir&s;t made me know, I fixed its purpo&s;e. Permit me to offer her my hand; I cannot be happy without her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What do you &s;ay, &s;ir? &s;aid Mrs. Carlton, exce&s;&s;ively &s;urpri&s;ed: would you marry my daughter? But after a little pau&s;e, No, pur|&s;ued
<PB N="62" REF="73">
&s;he, this can never be, your father will not con&s;ent to it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I own freely to you, madam, &s;aid Mr. Courteney, that I have no hopes of gaining my father's con&s;ent; but when the affai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> irretrievable, he will be &s;oftened, I am &s;ure he will. Let not this &s;cruple hinder you from giving your daughter a protector.

You have my con|&s;ent, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he to Mr. Courteney; would it plea&s;ed God that you had his al&s;o, whom it is your duty to con&s;ult on this occa&s;ion, and to obey if you can.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney a&s;&s;ured her he would &s;olicit his father's con&s;ent; but that he could not be happy without mi&s;s Carlton, and was already determined.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That young lady had retired into another room at the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, in perturbations which may be better imagined than de&s;cribed. Mr. Courteney, by her mo|ther's permi&s;&s;ion, attended her: he approached her with a timidity, which, the inequality of their circum&s;tances con&s;idered, may &s;eem &s;ur|pri&s;ing; but tho&s;e who know the nature of a &s;incere and violent pa&s;&s;ion, will ea&s;ily account
<PB N="63" REF="74">
for it. For fear, &s;ays an elegant writer, al|ways accompanies love when it is great, as flames burn highe&s;t when they tremble mo&s;t. He took her hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it re&s;pectfully, told her that Mrs. Carlton had begun his feli|city, by permitting him to offer him&s;elf to her acceptance as a hu&s;band, but that &s;he only could complete it by her con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mi&s;s Carlton blu&s;hed, turned pale, and blu&s;hed again: at length &s;he replied, that &s;he had no other will than her mother's. But this offer, added &s;he, in an accent that expre&s;&s;ed at once her &s;urpri&s;e and grati|tude, is &s;o generous, &s;o unexpected, &s;o un|hoped for&mdash; The la&s;t words &s;eemed to e&s;cape her; &s;he blu&s;hed more than before. Mr. Courteney took in all their tender meaning: he ki&s;&s;ed her hand again in a rapture of joy, and was beginning to make her &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate declarations, when they heard the nur&s;e cry|ing out for help.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Surpri&s;e and joy at what had &s;o lately happened, operated &s;o powerfully on Mrs. Carlton's almo&s;t exhau&s;ted &s;pirits, that &s;he had fallen into a fainting fit.

to London and di&s;patch a phy&s;ician to attend her, and would be with her again the next evening.</Q></P>

<P>The &s;tory continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>MR. Courteney's fir&s;t care was to &s;end a phy&s;ician to the &s;ick lady; and that performed, he deliberated in what manner he &s;hould acquaint his father with his intention. He knew him too well to hope for his con|&s;ent to his marriage with mi&s;s Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and he had not courage enough to &s;tand the re|proaches of a parent, whom he was predeter|mined to di&s;obey. He cho&s;e therefore o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> write to him, &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould, when un|awed by his pre&s;ence, be able to find argu|ments &s;trong enough to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, and to plead his excu&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As he dreaded extremely a private inter|view with his father, he was glad to find at
<PB N="65" REF="76">
his return home, that a great deal of company was expected that evening; he did not ap|pear till they were all met, having purpo&s;ely wa&s;ted a good deal of time in dre&s;&s;ing. The earl was &s;till ruffled with what had pa&s;&s;ed be|fore between him and his &s;on; and Mr. Cour|teney ob&s;erved that his looks and behaviour were le&s;s kind than u&s;ual.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as he retired to his apartment, in|&s;tead of going to bed, he &s;at down to compo&s;e a letter to his father. He began with the highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of grief for having by an ir|re&s;i&s;table impul&s;e engaged his affections with|out his concurrence; he ju&s;tified his choice by every argument that love could &s;ugge&s;t in fa|vour of the beloved object: he implored the continuance of his father's affection; and promi&s;ed in every future action the mo&s;t per|fect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This difficult ta&s;k performed, he found his mind much ea&s;ier and compo&s;ed, as if in rea|lity he had obtained the pardon he had &s;oli|cited, and now re&s;igned him&s;elf to all the plea&s;ing reveries of &s;ucce&s;sful love.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After a few hours re&s;t, he ro&s;e under pre|tence of going out to ride; and, leaving orders with a &s;ervant to deliver his letter to
<PB N="66" REF="77">
his father at his hour of dre&s;&s;ing, he went im|mediately to the Commons, procured a li|cence, and flew to Chel&s;ea; he found Mrs. Carlton much wor&s;e than when he left her; yet joy at &s;eeing him again &s;eemed to give her new life and &s;pirits. She called him to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bed-&s;ide; he acquainted her with what he had done; &s;he had &s;ome &s;cruples, but the fear of leaving her daughter de&s;titute overbalanced them all.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am dying, &s;aid &s;he, pre&s;&s;ing his hand; the phy&s;ician you &s;ent was too &s;incere to flatter me. I die contented, &s;ince I leave my child under your protection. Let the ceremony be performed in my pre&s;ence; after that is over I &s;hall have no farther bu&s;ine&s;s with the world. Mi&s;s Carlton, drowned in tears, and almo&s;t &s;inking under the violence of her grief, was with diffi|culty per&s;uaded to give her hand to her lover at &s;o &s;hocking a time; but her dy|ing mother conjured her to give her that la&s;t &s;atisfaction.&mdash; A clergyman was in|&s;tantly provided by the faithful nur&s;e: the clerk acted as father to the weeping bride; and Mr. Courteney's &s;ervant and the good nur&s;e were witne&s;&s;es. &mdash; Never &s;ure was there a more melancholy wedding &mdash; the

bridegroom's joy was checked by &s;impathi&s;|ing concern&mdash;the bride's tender &s;en&s;ibility lo&s;t in agoni&s;ing woe&mdash;the &s;ervice was performed with the &s;olemn &s;adne&s;s of a funeral.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as it was over, Mrs. Carlton col|lected all her remaining &s;trength and &s;pirits, to pronounce a ble&s;&s;ing on the new-wedded pair; and &s;training her daughter with a weak em|brace, declared that &s;he was now ea&s;y, and &s;hould die in peace. Mr. Courteney made a genteel pre&s;ent to the clergyman and the clerk, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them: he took an affec|tionate leave of Mrs. Carlton, who de&s;ired to be left to her private devotions; and earne&s;tly recommending his bride to the care of her nur&s;e, he went back to town with a re&s;olution to declare his marriage to his father; his &s;enti|ments being too delicate and his notions of honour too ju&s;t to permit him on any con&s;i|deration of intere&s;t to conceal the engagements he had entered into, and &s;uffer the woman whom he thought worthy to be his wife to live under a doubtful character.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On his return home he found his letter had been delivered to the earl. His mother, be|ing informed of his arrival, &s;ent for him to her dre&s;&s;ing-room, where he found her in tears. She told him that his father had been in the
<PB N="68" REF="79">
mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of anger, upon receiv|ing his letter; and &s;he conjured him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he valued her peace, to proceed no farther in a de&s;ign that mu&s;t inevitably be his ruin.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney &s;ighed, and was preparing to an&s;wer her, when the earl him&s;elf entered the room: the impre&s;&s;ion of his fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was &s;till vi&s;ible on his countenance. As &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he &s;aw his &s;on, he poured a torrent of re|proaches on him, inveighing again&s;t his meanne&s;s and ingratitude; then &s;uddenly, and with great vehemence, uttered the mo&s;t dread|ful imprecations on him, if he followed the dictates of his de&s;picably-placed pa&s;&s;ion, and married a beggar.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, hold my lord! cried Mr. Courteney, throwing him&s;elf at his feet; cur&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not, for I am already married. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t mad with rage at this confe&s;&s;ion, &s;purned him rudely with his foot, and flung out of the room, declaring that he renounced him for ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Courteney, &s;lung with indignation at this treatment, ro&s;e up, and uttered &s;ome words of re&s;entment, when his attention was called off from the affront he had &s;uffered, by the condition in which he ob&s;erved his mother, who, from &s;urpri&s;e and terror, had &s;wooned,
<PB N="69" REF="80">
and lay motionle&s;s on the couch, where &s;he had thrown her&s;elf. Mr. Courteney, exce&s;|&s;ively &s;hocked at this &s;ight, rung the bell for her woman, while he applied him&s;elf to give her all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was able. As &s;oon as he &s;aw her recovering, he &s;taid not to increa&s;e her di&s;order by his pre&s;ence, but retired to his apartment; and after he had taken all the money he had in his cabinet, he left that hou&s;e that was now become dreadful to him, and went to the lodgings of a young gentleman who had been his fellow-&s;tudent at college, and whom he had rea&s;on to believe his friend, if friend&s;hip can be acquired by confering obligations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To this young gentleman he unloaded his heart, but found not the con&s;olation he ex|pected. He expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and concern for his indi&s;creet marriage; and, in&s;tead of offering him any advice in his per|plexed &s;ituation, or con&s;oling him, oppre&s;&s;ed as he was by the di&s;plea&s;ure of his father, ma|nife&s;ted in &s;o contemptuous a manner, he maintained that the earl's anger was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and exclaimed at his imprudence in ruining him&s;elf for a woman.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Before the mi&s;chief was done, remon&s;trances might have been &s;ea&s;onable; but nothing
<PB N="70" REF="81">
could be more unkind than to in&s;i&s;t upon an error which was already committed, and could not be repaired. Mr. Courteney was at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed at this behaviour in a man who had always &s;hewn &s;o deep a &s;en&s;e of his kindne&s;s, and profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t tender friend&s;hip for him: but he had &s;till temper enough left to con&s;ider, that mo&s;t people follow their own intere&s;ts, and are at one time grateful for their convenience, and at another ungrateful for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He left him without taking any notice of the di&s;gu&s;t he had conceived; and after he had hired lodgings for the reception of his wife, he ha&s;tened to Chel&s;ea, where he ar|rived time enough to moderate the fir&s;t agonies of her grief for the lo&s;s of her mother, who had expired a few moments before.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Having given directions concerning the fu|neral, he forced Mrs. Courteney out of that mournful hou&s;e, and carried her to London, applying him&s;elf with the tendere&s;t a&s;&s;iduity to alleviate the &s;en&s;e of her lo&s;s, all his own ju&s;t cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s being forgot, and his anxiety for the melancholy future lo&s;t in his contemplation of the happy pre&s;ent: &s;o true it is that wedded-love &s;upplies the want of every other ble&s;&s;ing in life; and as no condi|tion

can be truly happy without it, &s;o none can be ab&s;olutely mi&s;erable with it.</Q></P>

<P><Q>IN the mean time Mr. Courteney corre&s;|ponded privately with his mother, who&s;e gentle nature had, with little difficulty, been &s;oftened into a forgivene&s;s of her &s;on's impru|dent marriage; but all her endeavours to re|concile the earl to it had proved ineffectual.

<P><Q>The counte&s;s dur&s;t not hazard an interview with her &s;on, while his father's re&s;entment continued unappea&s;ed; but &s;he allowed him two hundred a year out of her pin-money, and upon this moderate income they lived with more happine&s;s than is often to be found in the highe&s;t affluence.</Q>

<P>"What a romantic picture," &s;aid mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Courteney laughing,
<Q>have you drawn! It is a mighty pretty one it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, but it is not at all like. I remember, when I was about fourteen, I had the &s;ame notions of &s;hepherds and &s;hepherde&s;&s;es; but I was &s;oon cured. I happened to be at the hou&s;e of a country gentleman, who managed a large farm of his own; one of the &s;ervants &s;ay|ing &s;omething about the &s;hepherd, my heart danced at the &s;ound. My imagination re|pre&s;ented to me &s;uch a pretty figure as we &s;ee on the &s;tage in the dramatic pa&s;toral en|tertainment of Damon and Phillida, in a fine green habit, all bedizened with ribbons, a neat crook, and a garland of flowers. I begged to be permitted to go into the fields to
<PB N="73" REF="84">
&s;ee the &s;hepherd, and eagerly enquired if there were no &s;hepherde&s;&s;es likewi&s;e; but how was I di&s;appointed!&mdash;The &s;hepherd was an old man in a ragged wai&s;tcoat, and &s;o mi&s;erably &s;un|burnt, that he might have been taken for a mu|latto: the &s;hepherde&s;s looked like a witch; &s;he was &s;itting under a hedge, mending old &s;tock|ings, with a &s;traw hive on her head, and a tatter'd garment on, of as many colours as there were patches in it. How diverting it would have been to have heard this ena|mour'd &s;wain &s;igh out &s;oft things to this lovely nymph!</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! ridiculous," cried mi&s;s Woodby&mdash;
<Q>I am &s;ick at the very thought; but, my dear Clelia, go on, I be&s;eech you, with your &s;tory.</Q></P>
<P>"I have not come to my own &s;tory yet," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>all that you have heard has been only an introduction to it; and I have given you the hi&s;tory of my parents in the words, as near as I can remember, of my mother; for &s;he loved &s;cribbling, and com|mitted the principal incidents of her life to paper, which for my in&s;truction &s;he per|mitted me to read: I &s;ay in&s;truction, for &s;he was a woman of fine under&s;tanding and deep thinking, and &s;he had inter&s;per&s;ed through
<PB N="74" REF="85">
her little narrative many beautiful and ju&s;t re|flections, and many ob&s;ervations and u&s;eful maxims, which her reading, which was very comprehen&s;ive, and her experience furni&s;hed her with.</Q></P>
<P>"Proceed, my dear Clelia," &s;aid mi&s;s Wood|by, ob&s;erving Henrietta pau&s;ed here,
<Q>I am impatient to hear more.</Q>
"If you plea&s;e," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, "we will drink tea fir&s;t."
<Q>I have ju&s;t two hours and a half to &s;tay with you,</Q>
replied mi&s;s Woodby, looking at her "watch;
<Q>if I am at home by nine o'clock, which is my aunt's hour for &s;upper, it will do.</Q>
Henrietta then ordered tea, which was &s;oon di&s;patched, and &s;he re&s;umed her &s;tory in this manner.</P>
<P><Q>My father, who was very de&s;irous of con|ciliating at lea&s;t his elder brother's affections, wrote to him, he being now upon his travels, and gave him an account of his marriage; but his letter, though conceived in the mo&s;t tender and re&s;pectful terms, produced a cruel and &s;upercilious an&s;wer, which not only took away all hope of his proving a mediator be|tween him and his father, but convinced him that he had in him no longer a friend or bro|ther.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86">
<Q>His affairs were in this de&s;perate &s;ituation when my mother became pregnant; a di&s;tant relation of my father's now took an intere&s;t in this event, and being very rich and ambitious of making a family, he declared that if the child was a &s;on, he would adopt him and make him his heir. You may imagine this de&s;ign was received with great joy; the old gentle|man was very a&s;&s;iduous in his vi&s;its to my mo|ther during her pregnancy, and &s;eemed ex|tremely happy in the thoughts of perpetuating his name; an ambition very common to per|&s;ons of low extraction, who, by indu&s;try and thrift, have ri&s;en to great riches: for he was only by marriage a relation to my father, and had been too much neglected on account of the meanne&s;s of his original. But all the&s;e flattering expectations were de&s;troyed by my birth, which I had rea&s;on to &s;ay proved a mi&s;|fortune to my parents. The capricious old man was &s;o greatly chagrined at his di&s;ap|pointment, that he transferred all his favours to another cou&s;in, who was &s;o lucky as to pre&s;ent him with a &s;on to &s;ucceed to his for|tune, and continue his ob&s;cure name to po&s;|terity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My brother's birth happened a year after|wards, and unfortunately for him a year too
<PB N="76" REF="87">
late. My father &s;till continued to draw his whole income from the bounty of his mother, who was a con&s;tant but fruitle&s;s mediator in his behalf: her death, which happened about three years after his marriage, was an irrepa|rable lo&s;s to him; for it was not improbable but the lenient hand of time, which weakens the force of every pa&s;&s;ion, joined to her tender &s;olicitations, might have effected a reconcilia|tion between his father and him; but this hope was now no more: the counte&s;s be|queathed my father all the money &s;he had &s;aved, which was but a very &s;mall &s;um; for &s;he had always given with a liberal hand to the poor, though with &s;o little o&s;tentation, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had &s;aved &s;ome thou&s;ands out of her pin-money, for &s;he was le&s;s expen|&s;ive than any other woman of her rank in Eng|land; but it was not till after my father's mar|riage, that &s;he began to &s;ave, and then only for him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Six hundred pounds was all that was found in her cabinet, which &s;ome months after her decea&s;e was paid to my father with every cir|cum&s;tance of contempt.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e repeated calamities were &s;o far from le&s;&s;ening the love of my father and mother, that they &s;eemed to redouble their tenderne&s;s;
<PB N="77" REF="88">
&s;eeking in each other that happine&s;s which for|tune denied them, and which they were always &s;ure to find in their own virtue and mutual af|fection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My father, who had had a very liberal edu|cation, employed the greate&s;t part of his time in the in&s;truction of his children: under his tuition I acquired the French and Italian lan|guages; by my mother I was taught every u&s;eful accompli&s;hment for a young woman in my &s;ituation; nor did my father's narrow cir|cum&s;tances hinder him from procuring me tho&s;e which were &s;uitable to my birth. My brother had no other tutor but this excellent father, who qualified him for a univer&s;ity; and at fourteen years of age he was &s;ent to that of Leyden, and I have never &s;een him &s;ince.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the mean time the earl my grandfather, who &s;till continued inexorable, was taken off &s;uddenly by an apoplectick fit; and having never altered his will, which he made imme|diately after the marriage of my father, he found he was cut off with a &s;hilling. This &s;troke, as it was always expected, was le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly felt than another which immediately followed it. That relation, to who&s;e e&s;tate my father was to &s;ucceed, having buried his wife, married a young woman, who, in a year
<PB N="78" REF="89">
afterwards brought him a &s;on to inherit his for|tune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My father, now &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of any provi&s;ion for his children, fell into a deep me|lancholy: he had by the intere&s;t of &s;ome of his friends, obtained a place which brought him in between three and four hundred a year; but out of this it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave much. The unea&s;ine&s;s of mind which he laboured under, corrupted his blood; he was &s;eized with a decay which carried him off in a few months, and deprived his wife of the be&s;t hu&s;|band, his children of the be&s;t father that ever was.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In his la&s;t illne&s;s he had wrote to his bro|ther, and recommended his helple&s;s family to his compa&s;&s;ion; but that nobleman, who&s;e avarice was his &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and who&s;e re&s;entment again&s;t his brother was kept up by the arts of his wife; her family, though noble, being very poor, and therefore depend|ent upon him, took no other notice of my father's la&s;t reque&s;t, than to &s;end my mo|ther a bank bill for an hundred pounds; de|claring at the &s;ame time that it was all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he mu&s;t ever expect from him; and with this heroick act of genero&s;ity, he &s;ilenced
<PB N="79" REF="90">
the &s;oft pleadings of nature, and per&s;uaded him|&s;elf that he had done his duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My mother, being young with child when my father died, mi&s;carried; and by that acci|dent, together with her continual grief, &s;he fell into a langui&s;hing illne&s;s, which threatened a &s;hort period to her days. Five hundred pounds was all that my father left: from this &s;mall &s;um a widow and two children were to draw their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. What a me|lancholy pro&s;pect! However my brother, who was then about &s;eventeen, had made &s;uch great proficiency in learning, that, notwith|&s;tanding his youth, he was recommended by the profe&s;&s;ors of the univer&s;ity to have the care of &s;ome Engli&s;h youths who &s;tudied there, which afforded him a decent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My mother having placed four hundred and fifty pounds in the hands of a rich merchant, who had been a friend of my father's, and gave her very good intere&s;t for it, &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of all her furniture, and with the money ari&s;ing from the &s;ale, &s;et out with me for Bath, the waters being pre&s;cribed to her by her phy&s;ician.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not being able to &s;upport the expence of living in the town, &s;he took lodgings in a plea|&s;ant village, about three miles di&s;temper from it; and here, feeling her di&s;temper daily gain|ing
<PB N="80" REF="91">
ground, &s;he prepared for death, with a re|&s;ignation that was only interrupted by her anxiety for me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It was not indeed ea&s;y to form any plan for my future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which would not &s;ub|ject me to a &s;ituation very unfit for my birth. Had my brother been provided for, &s;he would have made no &s;cruple of &s;inking that &s;mall &s;um that was left, into an annuity for my life, which with economy might &s;upport me above nece&s;&s;ity and dependence. She wrote to my brother, and de&s;ired his advice with regard to me. My brother, as if he had entered into her views, in his an&s;wer conjured her to have no &s;olicitude about him, &s;ince, with the edu|cation he had received, he could not fail of &s;upporting him&s;elf in the character of a gen|tleman, but to di&s;po&s;e of that money in any manner which might be mo&s;t for my advan|tage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My mother &s;hed tears of tender &s;atisfaction over this letter, &s;o full of duty to her, and af|fection for me; but the more generous and di&s;intere&s;ted her &s;on &s;howed him&s;elf, the le&s;s was &s;he capable of taking a re&s;olution, which, if any di&s;appointment happened to him, mu&s;t leave him without any re&s;ource.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="92">
<Q>You may be &s;ure, my dear mi&s;s Woodby, I was not very forward to fix her purpo&s;e; for I could not bear the thought of being the only per&s;on, in our little di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family, to whom a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was &s;ecured. While my mother was thus fluctuating, &s;he was vi&s;ited in her re|tirement by lady Manning, a widow lady of a very plentiful fortune, with whom &s;he had been in &s;ome degree of intimacy during the life of my father.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This lady &s;howed great fondne&s;s for me; and my mother imparting to her her difficul|ties with regard to &s;ettling me, lady Manning begged her to make her&s;elf quite ea&s;y, for that &s;he would take me under her own care.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mi&s;s Courteney, &s;aid &s;he, will do me ho|nour by accepting my hou&s;e for an a&s;ylum, and I and my daughter will think our&s;elves happy in &s;uch an agreeable companion. My mother was extremely plea&s;ed with this offer; and lady Manning pre&s;&s;ed me to go with her to London, for which place &s;he was to &s;et out in a few days.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was &s;o much &s;hocked at the propo&s;al of leaving my mother in the dangerous condition &s;he was judged to be, that I did not receive lady Manning's offer with that &s;en&s;e of her in|tended kindne&s;s which &s;he doubtle&s;s expected;
<PB N="82" REF="93">
and when my mother, wholly governed by the con&s;ideration of my intere&s;t, urged me to go with lady Manning, I bur&s;t into a vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion of tears, vehemently prote&s;ting that I would never leave her; and lamenting her cau&s;ele&s;s di&s;tru&s;t of my affection in &s;up|po&s;ing that I could be prevailed upon, by any pro&s;pect of advantage to my&s;elf, to &s;eparate from her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I ob&s;erved lady Manning redened at the&s;e words, which &s;he under&s;tood as a reproach for her making &s;o improper a propo&s;al, and which I really de&s;ired &s;he &s;hould: for I was highly di&s;gu&s;ted with her want of delicacy, in de&s;iring me to leave my mother, and her be|lieving it po&s;&s;ible that I could con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;aw plea&s;ure in my mother's eyes at this artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ion of my tenderne&s;s for her; but at the &s;ame time I thought I could per|ceive by the turn of her countenance that &s;he was apprehen&s;ive I had di&s;obliged lady Man|ning: therefore I endeavoured to remove her fears by the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of gratitude to that lady. She received tho&s;e a&s;&s;urances with a little &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s at fir&s;t, but that pre|&s;ently wore off; and at parting &s;he renewed her profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip to my mother, and promi&s;es of a parent's care of me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="94">
<Q>She left Bath three days afterwards, &s;o that we did not &s;ee her again, which made my mo|ther a little unea&s;y; but we had &s;oon a very kind letter from her, in which &s;he repeated all her former offers, and expre&s;&s;ed great tender|ne&s;s for me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At her return from London, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through Bath in her way to her country-&s;eat; and, finding my mother much wor&s;e, &s;he re|doubled her profe&s;&s;ions of affection for me, and was &s;o lavi&s;h in her promi&s;es, that &s;he left her quite ea&s;y on my account. Indeed, notwith|&s;tanding what I have &s;uffered from lady Man|ning, I &s;hall ever think my&s;elf obliged to her for contributing &s;o greatly towards that compo|&s;ure of mind which my mother felt, from the time that &s;he thought me &s;ecure of an a&s;ylum, till it would &s;uit with my brother's circum|&s;tances to take me under his own care.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will not, my dear mi&s;s Woodby, enlarge upon the la&s;t three months of my mother's life, which was &s;pent in a con&s;tant preparation for her end. Indeed the innocence of her manners, and the unfeigned piety that &s;hone through her conduct, made her whole life one conti|nued preparation for that awful moment, &s;o dreadful to the wicked; &s;o full of peace, con|fidence, and holy joy to the good.

<P>The tears, which at this tender remembrance ran from mi&s;s Courteney's eyes, made a pathe|tick pau&s;e in her relation; but recovering her|&s;elf, &s;he proceeded, as will be found in the fol|lowing Book.</P>

<P><Q>About three days after I had wrote to lady Manning, I received a letter from her, which was brought by one of her &s;ervants; in which, after the u&s;ual compliments of condolance, &s;he de&s;ired I would &s;et out immediately with the per&s;on whom &s;he had &s;ent to attend me. My guardian, for &s;o I u&s;ed now to call Mr. Bale, coming in, I told him I mu&s;t prepare to be gone immediately, and gave him lady Manning's letter to read.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How are you to go, mi&s;s? &s;aid he, after he had looked over the letter. As I never doubted but lady Manning had &s;ent her po&s;t-chai&s;e or chariot for me, I told him I &s;uppo&s;ed there was a carriage come with the me&s;&s;enger.</Q></P>
<P><Q>O yes, replied Mr. Bale, there is a very good pillion, and you are to ride behind the footman, I took notice of the equipage as I came in, but I &s;hall not permit you to per|form a journey of thirty miles in that manner: therefore, mi&s;s, I would have you &s;end a letter to the lady by her me&s;&s;enger, and inform her that your guardian will convey you &s;afe to her &s;eat.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98">
<Q>I was as much plea&s;ed with this kind atten|tion in Mr. Bale, as I was &s;hocked and &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the ungenteel manner in which lady Manning had &s;ent for me: however I con|cealed my thoughts of it, and wrote &s;uch a letter as my guardian de&s;ired me. The next morning at eight o'clock, a po&s;t-chai&s;e was ready at the door, and, Mr. Bale attending; all my cloaths had been packed up the night before, and we &s;et out immediately.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Manning received us very politely, and detained Mr. Bale to dinner. I thought I could ob&s;erve &s;omething forced in the re&s;pect &s;he &s;eemed to pay me; and I was particularly di&s;gu&s;ted with her u&s;ing the words <HI>Your guar|dian</HI> every moment, as if in deri&s;ion of the title I had to one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When Mr. Bale went away, he took an opportunity to &s;peak to me apart, and made me promi&s;e him, if I &s;hould have any rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with my &s;ituation, that I would write to him plainly, and he would come him|&s;elf and fetch me away. This tender &s;olici|tude in the good old man affected me very &s;en&s;ibly, and I could not help &s;hedding tears when I &s;aw him drive away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Manning was extremely inqui&s;itive about his connexion with me, and a&s;ked me a
<PB N="88" REF="99">
great many que&s;tions. I am very glad, &s;aid &s;he, your affairs are in the hands of &s;o wi&s;e a man; for &s;urely he who can rai&s;e a large e&s;tate out of nothing, as has been the ca&s;e with Mr. Bale, mu&s;t needs be a very wi&s;e man, and I don't doubt but he will manage your fortune to the be&s;t advantage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with the fir&s;t part of this &s;peech, and particularly with the manner in which the word Fortune was drauled out.</Q></P>
<P>"The poor trifle I have, madam, replied I, "does not de&s;erve to be termed a fortune.</P>
<P><Q>I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid &s;he, it was very kind in a man of Mr. Bale's &s;ub&s;tance to trouble him&s;elf with &s;uch incon&s;iderable matters; and it is a great thing for you to be permitted to call &s;uch a man guardian.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Very true, madam, replied I, with &s;ome warmth; and I believe Mr. Bale thinks it no di&s;credit to be called &s;o by a child of Mr. Cour|teney's, whatever her fortune may be.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I ob&s;erved lady Manning to reden at this reply, which at that time &s;urpri&s;ed me, and I could not conceive the rea&s;on of it; but I &s;oon found that it was a mortal crime in her eyes to pretend to derive any advantage from birth. There was nothing which &s;he &s;eemed to hold in greater contempt than family-pride,
<PB N="89" REF="100">
and indeed, when un&s;ea&s;onably exerted, it is contemptible; but it was plain that lady Man|ning did not think meanly of the fortuitous ad|vantage of being well-born, becau&s;e &s;he envied tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that advantage; and tho' the daughter of a &s;oap-boiler her&s;elf, &s;he was extremely fond of being thought to have an|ce&s;tors; and it was to gratify her pride, that her hu&s;band, who was a rich citizen, by trade a brewer, got him&s;elf knighted, that, toge|ther with a very large jointure, he might leave his wife the title of lady.</Q></P>
<P>"Surely," interrupted mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>this woman had no good intentions when &s;he in|vited you to her hou&s;e; it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch low creatures can have any notion of friend&s;hip or genero&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>"You have gue&s;&s;ed truly," replied mi&s;s Cour|teney;
<Q>it was to gratify her pride, to have the daughter of a gentleman &s;ubjected to her ca|price, and dependent on her bounty, that made her &s;o &s;olicitous of having me with her; but although I did not make the&s;e reflections im|mediately, yet I was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted by this fir&s;t conver&s;ation, that I could not promi&s;e my&s;elf any great happine&s;s in &s;uch &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Her daughter was now introduced to me, a tall aukward thing about &s;eventeen: &s;he was
<PB N="90" REF="101">
an heire&s;s; and being taught to believe that riches give birth, beauty, wit, and every de|&s;irable quality, &s;he held every one in contempt who was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this advantage, and becau&s;e &s;he had it her&s;elf, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had all the others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whatever documents were given her, they were always introduced with&mdash;Con&s;ider, mi&s;s, what a fortune you are&mdash; a young lady of your fortune.&mdash; How was it po&s;&s;ible for a girl thus tutored, not to derive in&s;olence from the con|&s;ideration of her fortune?</Q></P>
<P><Q>The governe&s;s, who had the care of this young lady, was not very likely to enlarge her notions&mdash; Her only recommendation for &s;uch a tru&s;t was, that &s;he could jabber corrupted French without either &s;en&s;e or grammar, and mi&s;s was taught to parler fran&ccedil;oi&s;e in a broad provincial dialect; for this governe&s;s had never &s;een Paris, and perhaps had never been out of the little village where &s;he was born and bred, and conver&s;ed only with pea&s;ants, till &s;he came to England to teach language and fine breed|ing to a great heire&s;s. It was very natural for lady Manning to make &s;uch a choice, who doubtle&s;s thought it a great di&s;tinction to have a foreigner for governe&s;s to her daughter.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="102">"Nay, my dear," interrupted mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>lady Manning in this particular does not differ from many per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality, who commit the education of their daughters to low vulgar creatures, merely becau&s;e they are French; creatures that in Paris, or in any of the chief cities in the provinces, would not be thought qualified for a chamber-maid to a woman of any fa&s;hion, yet when driven into England on account of their religion, as they all pretend, though perhaps it is for want of bread in their own country, derive &s;uch di&s;|tinction from their flim&s;y &s;acks, their pow|dered hair, and their &s;peaking French, that they are thought the fitte&s;t per&s;ons in the world to form the manners of young girls of quality. How ab&s;urd &s;hould we think it in a French woman of quality to entertain an aukward York&s;hire girl with a coar&s;e clowni&s;h accent, as Engli&s;h governe&s;s to her daughter, to teach her the language, and cor|rect her pronunciation? and yet not one in twenty of the Mademoi&s;elles in the hou&s;es of our nobility and our French boarding-&s;chools, are better qualified for &s;uch an office.&mdash;But I beg pardon, my dear, for interrupting you &s;o long: I long to hear what &s;ort of a life you lived in this rich de&s;picable family.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="103">"Truly," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>it was not very agreeable, when lady Manning and I were alone, &s;he u&s;ed to entertain me with an ac|count of her forefathers; &s;he reckoned up among them half a dozen &s;heriffs, three lord-mayors, and a long train of aldermen. She lamented the death of her hu&s;band mo&s;t pathetically; for if he had lived two years longer, he would have been elected lord-mayor, and &s;he would have lived in the Man|&s;ion-hou&s;e, and been queen of the city&mdash; Her own words.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When we were at table and the &s;ervants attending, &s;he u&s;ed to turn the di&s;cour&s;e upon the misfortunes of my father, lament the &s;ad condition to which my mother and I were re|duced by his death, expre&s;s great anxiety about my brother, and enter into a minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of our affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When there was company pre&s;ent, &s;he would take notice that I was melancholy, and tell me that I mu&s;t not take misfortunes to heart, and then &s;igh as if &s;he was extremely affected with them her&s;elf; by which &s;he recommended me to her vi&s;iters as an object of compa&s;&s;ion, and never failed by that means to produce &s;ome in&s;tance of neglect towards
<PB N="93" REF="104">
me; &s;o powerfully did that con&s;ideration ope|rate upon mo&s;t minds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She would &s;harply reprehend her daughter for any &s;uppo&s;ed want of civility to me, and pa&s;s over in &s;ilence any real one; telling her that if mi&s;s Courteney had not a fortune, yet &s;he was a gentlewoman as well as her&s;elf, and that no body &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed for being poor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Such were the continued mortifications that I was obliged to endure from this generous benefactre&s;s: yet I ought not to call them mortifications, becau&s;e they only excited my contempt; about that time I received a letter from my brother, in which he informed me that he was going to travel with a young Engli&s;h nobleman, who&s;e governor had died &s;uddenly at Leyden, and whom he was appointed to &s;uc|ceed upon a very advantageous footing, on account of his birth, he de&s;ired me to draw upon him for what money I had occa&s;ion for.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I received the&s;e in&s;ults with the more in|difference, as I knew I could put an end to them when I plea&s;ed, by quitting lady Man|ning's hou&s;e, which I could now do without any inconvenience to my&s;elf; and fore&s;eeing that this indelicacy in her treatment of me, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily end in &s;omething too coar&s;e
<PB N="94" REF="105">
for me to di&s;&s;emble my re&s;entment, I was willing to &s;tay till &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf in her true colours, which would be my ju&s;tification whenever I quitted her.</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Wherein family-pride awakens tho&s;e natural affec|tions which family-pride had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>IT was not long before I had this opportu|nity. She de&s;ired me one day to walk with her in the garden, having &s;omething to com|municate to me greatly to my advantage; and, after a profound &s;ilence of about ten minutes, &s;he looked archly at me, and a&s;ked me if I could gue&s;s what &s;he had been doing for me? Indeed I cannot. Madam, replied I. Well then I will tell you, &s;aid &s;he, nothing le&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you, than providing you a husband. Indeed! &s;aid I, laughing, and pray, madam, who is this intended husband? Come, come, &s;aid &s;he gravely, before I tell you who he is, you mu&s;t promi&s;e me to make no &s;illy objec|tions; &s;uch as age, not being a fine gentleman, and the like. The per&s;on I have in my eye for you is a &s;ober &s;taid man, and ble&s;&s;ed with means to &s;upport you hand&s;omely, without
<PB N="95" REF="106">
depending upon any body. That indeed is &s;omething, replied I; but who is this per&s;on, Madam? I have a good mind, &s;aid &s;he, to tantalize you a little, by keeping you in &s;u&s;|pence;&mdash;but in &s;hort the per&s;on I mean is hone&s;t Mr. Vellum.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Although I expected &s;ome very ab&s;urd and impertinent propo&s;al, yet my imagination had never reached any thing &s;o riciculous as this Mr. Vellum; for I had had his hi&s;tory from him&s;elf &s;ome time before. He had been taken by her father out of a pari&s;h-&s;chool, becau&s;e he under&s;tood writing and accounts, to keep his books for him. Upon his young mi&s;tre&s;s's marriage, he was advanced to be a clerk in her husband's office; and here, having &s;craped up a little money, he made &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful ventures in trade, and had acquired about two thou&s;and pounds. After Sir John's death, my lady made him her &s;teward, with a &s;allary of fifty pounds a-year; and he was in this ho|nourable and lucrative po&s;t, when &s;he propo&s;ed him as a husband for me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My &s;urpri&s;e was &s;ucceeded by a &s;trong in|clination to laugh, which, indeed, I took no pains to &s;uppre&s;s; and pray madam, &s;aid I, has this grave per&s;onage expre&s;&s;ed any good liking to me?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="107">
<Q>I hope you are not je&s;ting, &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;Why, did you expect me to be &s;erious, replied I, upon &s;uch a propo&s;al?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Such a propo&s;al mi&s;s! repeated lady Man|ning colouring: if my daughter was in your circum&s;tances, I &s;hould not be &s;orry &s;uch a propo&s;al was made to her. Very likely madam, returned I, and it might be more proper than to Mr. Courteney's daughter, and the niece of the earl of &mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>This may look like vanity, my dear mi&s;s Woodby; but I confe&s;s I was exce&s;&s;ively &s;hocked at her levelling me with her daugh|ter, when riches were out of the que&s;tion; for I was contented to allow her all the &s;upe|riority &s;he could derive from them. Lady Manning made me a &s;marter an&s;wer, and de|livered with more calmne&s;s than I expected from her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If the earl of&mdash;, &s;aid &s;he, behaved more like an uncle to you, mi&s;s, it would be oftener remembered that you are his niece; but, as it is, I do not know whether it may not be an advantage to you, to have it forgot; for there are very few gentlemen of &s;mall fortunes who would choo&s;e an indigent woman of quality for a wife.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="108">
<Q>I hope however, madam, &s;aid I, that none but a gentleman will pre&s;ume to offer him&s;elf to me; and I &s;hall take care not to ju&s;tify my uncle's neglect, by encouraging any improper addre&s;s.&mdash;You are very much in the right, mi&s;s, &s;aid lady Manning, one unfortunate marriage in a family is enough.</Q></P>
<P><Q>'Tis well, madam, replied I, bur&s;ting into tears, you mean my father's, no doubt; but it was no otherwi&s;e unfortunate than that it had not the &s;anction of my grand-father's con&s;ent; my mother's excellencies ju&s;tified his choice; and &s;he might have had a fortune too, though not equal to what he might have expected, if it had not been tru&s;ted in the hands of a vil|lain, who broke to leave his own children fortunes, as many other villains have done.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This la&s;t hint threw lady Manning into &s;ome confu&s;ion; for it was &s;u&s;pected that her grand-father, who was a corn-factor, had done the like: and, whether it was that &s;he was afraid of my &s;peaking &s;till plainer, or that &s;he was really concerned for having given me &s;uch ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of her, &s;he thought fit to beg my pardon for what was pa&s;t, and a&s;&s;ured me, that whatever I might think of her, &s;he was unalterably my friend.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="109">
<Q>In my fir&s;t emotions of re&s;entment, I had re&s;olved to write to Mr. Bale, and acquaint him with the treatment I had met with, which I knew would bring him immediately to my relief: but I con&s;idered that my leaving lady Manning in di&s;gu&s;t might have di&s;agreeable con&s;equences; for &s;he would not fail to repre|&s;ent every thing in &s;uch a manner as to make me appear in the wrong, and the world &s;eldom e&s;pou&s;es the part of the oppre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they who oppre&s;s have that on their &s;ide which is &s;ure to exculpate them, and that is riches: be&s;ides, the &s;ummer was now almo&s;t pa&s;t, and &s;he talked of going &s;oon to London, where I could take an opportunity of leaving her without any noi&s;e, and of putting my&s;elf immediately under my guardian's protection; but I was delivered from this di&s;agreeable &s;i|tuation &s;ooner than I expected, and by means which I had then no rea&s;on to hope for.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Manning was de&s;irous of &s;pending a few weeks at Bath before &s;he returned to London. A lady happened to be there a that time, who, I afterwards learned, was my great aunt by my father's &s;ide, and had fol|lowed the example of every branch of his fa|mily, in taking no notice of him after his mar|riage.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="110">
<Q>This lady, lady Manning became ac|quainted with; and not knowing the relation in which &s;he &s;tood to me, &s;he began one day to exclaim again&s;t the pride and folly of people in low circum&s;tances, who expect to be con|&s;idered on account of their birth, producing me as an in&s;tance, and relating how I had re|fu&s;ed an hone&s;t man whom &s;he had propo&s;ed to me for a hu&s;band, becau&s;e he was not a gentleman, repeating my own words with a &s;neer; and therefore&mdash;<HI>Not a proper match for Mr. Courteney's daughter.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>This being the fir&s;t time &s;he had named me, lady Meadows (for it was her) cried out in &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, what, madam, is that pretty young lady (&s;o &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay) that I &s;aw with you once in the rooms, Mr. Courteney's daughter?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Manning an&s;wering in the affirmative &mdash;good heaven! &s;aid lady Meadows, and have I lived to hear one of my family &s;poken of with &s;uch contempt?</Q></P>
<P>"One of your family, madam! interrupted "lady Manning, &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q>Yes, &s;aid lady Meadows, one of my family, who has done you too much honour to accept of an obligation from you; how could you pre&s;ume to propo&s;e your &s;cound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el &s;teward for

<P><Q>It is not to be doubted that lady Manning replied with great bittterne&s;s; but lady Mea|dows, from whom I afterwards had the&s;e par|ticulars, was in too much emotion to li&s;ten to her. She immediately quittted the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for they were on the Parade; and getting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her chariot, told lady Manning, that &s;he was going to her lodgings to fetch me away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus, my dear mi&s;s Woodby, did I recover a relation, a friend, a benefactre&s;s, in a wo|man, who for many years, had had no inter|cour&s;e with my father, and di&s;claimed him, as the re&s;t of his relations had done, on account of his marriage: &s;he who&s;e re&s;entment could not be &s;oftened by time; who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion could not be awakened by di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he who had &s;ilenced the pleadings of nature, yet li&s;|tened to the voice of pride; and from a &s;en&s;e of the affront that had been offered her family, in the husband propo&s;ed to me, &s;he did all that a better motive could have &s;ugge&s;ted her to do.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may imagine I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, when a &s;ervant informed me, that lady Mea|dows
<PB N="101" REF="112">
was at the door in her chariot, and de|&s;ired I would come to her. I had often heard my father mention this aunt of his, from whom, before his marriage, he had great ex|pectations. I went down &s;tairs in much con|fu&s;ion of mind, not knowing what this &s;um|mons could mean, yet pre&s;aging &s;ome good; and as &s;oon as I appeared, lady Meadows let down the gla&s;s, and de&s;ired me to come into the chariot. Her footman in&s;tantly opening the door, I got in, and placed my&s;elf by her, expecting when &s;he would &s;peak, and anx|iou&s;ly longing for an explanation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Meadows gazed at me in &s;ilence, du|ring &s;ome moments; then taking my hand, My dear, &s;aid &s;he in a tender accent, you are very like your father. Poor Ned! added &s;he with &s;ome emotion, he was not kindly u&s;ed. &mdash;The tears &s;treamed from my eyes at this mention of my father. I ob&s;erved lady Mea|dows was greatly affected. Oh nature! thought I, why were thy tender feelings &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;o long? Don't weep my dear, &s;aid &s;he, I will be both father and mother to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Had I been in another place, I &s;hould have thrown my&s;elf at her feet, to expre&s;s my grati|tude for this affectionate promi&s;e. I could not &s;peak at that moment; I took her hand,

ki&s;&s;ed it, and wet it with my tears. She kindly wiped my eyes with her own handkerchief; then looking again in my face, as if with plea|&s;ure, you are like your mother too, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid &s;he: I never &s;aw her, but I have heard that &s;he was very hand&s;ome.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This obliging manner of mentioning my mother, which I &s;o little expected from her, quite &s;ubdued me. My dear, &s;aid &s;he what is pa&s;t cannot be helped; you are my daughter now; you &s;hall be no longer obliged to lady Manning. &mdash; That wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, pur&s;ued &s;he, ri&s;ing in her temper as &s;he &s;poke, has her&s;elf told me the in&s;olence of her treat|ment of you; &s;he then gave me an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed upon the Parade, as I have already related to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Manning thought to have injured me in your opinion, &s;aid I, and &s;he has made me happy, by awakening your tenderne&s;s for me: I now forgive her for all her in&s;ults.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But I never will forgive her, interrupted lady Meadows.&mdash;As &s;oon as we come to my lodgings, you &s;hall &s;end for your cloaths, and never more enter her doors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was very unwilling to part with lady Man|ning in this manner, and pre&s;&s;ed my aunt to allow me to go and take leave of her civilly;
<PB N="103" REF="114">
but &s;he po&s;itively refu&s;ed, and I found &s;he could not endure the lea&s;t contradiction, which is indeed one of her foibles. I therefore contented my&s;elf with writing to her, and ac|quainted her with lady Meadows's re&s;olution in my favour; I made the be&s;t apology I could for leaving her &s;o &s;uddenly, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern at the mi&s;under&s;tand|ing there was between lady Meadows and her, which made it impo&s;&s;ible for me to wait on her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Politene&s;s, my dear, is &s;ometimes a great tax upon &s;incerity. Lady Manning had cer|tainly treated me very ill, and in &s;trict ju&s;tice I was not obliged to &s;hew any re&s;pect to a woman who had violated all the laws of ho&s;|pitality with regard to me; but cu&s;tom de|cides arbitrarily in the&s;e ca&s;es; and per&s;ons in a certain condition of life, make a &s;cience of hating one another with all the good breeding and complai&s;ance imaginable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Manning, according to this rule, re|turned a civil an&s;wer to my letter, wi&s;hed me all happine&s;s, and wherever &s;he went, let loo&s;e all the a&s;perity of her tongue again&s;t me.

and that upon my aunt's promi&s;ing to &s;ettle her whole fortune upon me at her death, I had turned Roman catholick: for lady Mea|dows had been perverted to that religion by her hu&s;band, and, like all pro&s;elytes, was ex|tremely bigotted to her new principles.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I thought it became me to di&s;countenance this report as much as po&s;&s;ible; therefore I was more regular than ever in my attendance at church: and although my aunt, after we came to London, would often have engaged me to go to ma&s;s with her, intending no doubt to work me to her purpo&s;e by degrees; yet I con&s;tantly and &s;teddily refu&s;ed to gratify her in this particular, though in every other I &s;tudied to oblige her as much as po&s;&s;ible. She would often engage me in argument upon the &s;ubject of religion, which I gene|rally &s;trove to evade; and when I found that would not do, I defended my&s;elf with great courage, and with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that &s;he would tell me with an air, half &s;miling, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> angry, that I was too hard for her, and that &s;he would con&s;ign me over to her chap|lain.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which introduces a je&s;uit to the acquaintance of the reader.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"OH! my dear," cried mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>I am in de&s;pair to find it is &s;o late, I mu&s;t leave you now; but I am &s;o impatient to hear the re&s;t of your &s;tory, that if you will give me leave, I will breakfa&s;t with you to-morrow, and as &s;oon as my eager curio&s;ity is &s;atisfied, we will go together to Mrs. Egret's.</Q></P>
<P>She then de&s;ired a chair might be &s;ent for;
<Q>and in the mean time, &s;aid &s;he, we will &s;tep into the &s;hop, I will make a little purcha&s;e on purpo&s;e to &s;ee your landlady, whom you &s;eem to di&s;like &s;o much.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed I do not like her," replied Hen|rietta, "and yet &s;he is mighty civil." "Well," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby, tripping down &s;tairs,
<Q>I'll give you my opinion of her when I have &s;tudied her a little.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courtency was following her into the &s;hop, when perceiving the young gentleman, who was there the day before, in di&s;cour&s;e with Mrs. Eccles, &s;he pulled mi&s;s Woodby by the
<PB N="107" REF="118">
&s;leeve, whi&s;pering,
<Q>Don't go in now, there is &s;omebody with her.</Q>
"Indeed, but I will," replied mi&s;s Woodby, who &s;aw the glimp&s;e of a laced coat, for which &s;he had always a violent pa&s;&s;ion, "and &s;o &s;hall you likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he pulled mi&s;s Courteney in, and, &s;wimming up to Mrs. Eccles, bid her with a lively air &s;how her &s;ome ribbons and blond <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">laces.</P>
<P>The young gentleman, as &s;oon as the ladies appeared, made them a profound bow; and, fixing his eyes on Henrietta's face, &s;eemed to contemplate it with a&s;toni&s;hment and delight.</P>
<P>Mean time mi&s;s Woodby was playing over a thou&s;and fanta&s;tick airs, and uttering as many pretty ab&s;urdities, which &s;he had heard admired coming from the mouths of beauties, without reflecting that &s;he her&s;elf was no beauty&mdash;Mrs. Eccles perceived her foible immediately, and took occa&s;ion, when &s;he was &s;howing her &s;ome new-fa&s;hioned caps, to tell her, that &s;uch a one would &s;uit the air of her face; that this coloured ribbon was mo&s;t proper to &s;hew the lu&s;tre of her eyes; ob&s;erved that &s;he had wonderful fine hair, and begged to know who cut it.</P>
<P>Henrietta, a little in pain for her friend, to whom per&s;onal compliments were by no means proper, endeavoured to relieve the confu&s;ion
<PB N="108" REF="119">
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was under, by diverting her at|tention to &s;omething el&s;e, and a&s;ked her opinion of &s;ome Dre&s;den work that was lying before them. But mi&s;s Woodby had no lei&s;ure to an|&s;wer her; for the gentleman, conceiving that it was ea&s;ier to introduce &s;ome conver&s;ation to her than to mi&s;s Courteney, who&s;e mingled mo|de&s;ty and dignity &s;truck him with awe, addre&s;&s;ed a trifling que&s;tion to mi&s;s Woodby, which &s;he an&s;wered with &s;uch an affected &s;prightline&s;s, as encouraged him to talk to her with the famili|arity of an old acquaintance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodby was exce&s;&s;ively delighted with his addre&s;s to her, and played off all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|lery of eyes, air, and wit upon him,&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">opy was it for the young gentleman, who courage|ou&s;ly bore all her attacks, that this &s;he was given from two little grey eyes, over which her forehead hung like a precipice; and that this form, which was thrown into a thou&s;and dif|ferent attitudes to &s;trike him, was &s;o di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted by nature as to leave little more for affectation to do.</P>
<P>The chair had been waiting half an hour without mi&s;s Woodby's perceiving it, when Henrietta, who was not at all plea&s;ed with the figure her friend made, told her, &s;miling,
<Q>that &s;he would not let her &s;tay any longer,
<PB N="109" REF="120">
for fear &s;he &s;hould by that means be di&s;ap|pointed of her company at breakfa&s;t the next day.</Q></P>
<P>"I vow, my dear, you are in the right," cried mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>to &s;end me away; for my aunt is waiting &s;upper for me&mdash; I am a giddy creature.</Q>
&mdash; She then de&s;ired Mrs. Ec|cles to put up the things &s;he had bought; for, in the gaiety of her heart, &s;he had bought a great many. Mrs. Eccles obeyed, telling her &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould have the plea&s;ure of &s;erving &s;o agreeable a lady again.</P>
<P>The gentleman would hand her into her chair, which mi&s;s Woodby accepted with a very gal|lant air, after &s;he had a&s;&s;ured mi&s;s Courteney aloud, that &s;he would be with her in the morn|ing, and told her in a whi&s;per that her landlady was a very pretty behaved woman.</P>
<P>Henrietta went up to her chamber directly, to the great di&s;appointment of the young gen|tleman, who, finding there was no probability of &s;eeing her again that night, went away di&s;|burthened of a heart which he had left with the charming &s;tranger.</P>
<P>She was now &s;ummoned to &s;upper by Mrs. Eccles, who was full of prai&s;es of the young lady her vi&s;iter.
<Q>This has been a lucky day, to me, &s;aid &s;he, for I have let my fir&s;t floor,
<PB N="110" REF="121">
at a very good price, con&s;idering the &s;ea&s;on of the year.</Q>
I am glad of it," &s;aid the young lady.
<Q>That is very obliging of you, my dear mi&s;s,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>and you may &s;till have the u&s;e of the dining-room when you have company; for my lord wil be &s;eldom at home in the day, the&s;e lodgings are only to &s;leep in. But how do you like him? Is he not a mighty agreeable man? Dear &s;oul! not a bit of pride in him&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Do you mean the gentleman I &s;aw in the &s;hop?</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney. "Yes," re|turned Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>he is a lord, I a&s;&s;ure you.</Q>
"Well," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>I am glad you are not to lo&s;e one lodger with|out getting another, for I mu&s;t leave you to|morrow.</Q>
"How!" replied Mrs. Eccles, with an altered countenance,
<Q>I hope you are only in je&s;t.</Q>
<Q>Upon my word I am in earne&s;t,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney.
<Q>I am &s;orry for it, madam,</Q>
re&s;umed &s;he,
<Q>but this is very &s;hort notice.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the peevi&s;h|ne&s;s with which &s;he &s;poke the&s;e la&s;t words, &s;o dif|ferent from her u&s;ual complai&s;ance: but &s;he would not &s;eem to take notice of it, and only told her, that it was not her de&s;ign to &s;tay more than a few days at this end of the town, having
<PB N="111" REF="122">
affairs to tran&s;act in the city, which would oblige her for her own convenience to take lodgings there.</P>
<P>Mrs. Eccles appeared &s;atisfied with this an|&s;wer, though a cloud hung upon her brow during the whole time they were at &s;upper, which mi&s;s Courteney &s;hortened as much as po&s;&s;ible, and retired to her chamber, with new prejudices again&s;t her landlady, that made her rejoice in the pro&s;pect of getting away the next day.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodby came according to her promi&s;e to breakfa&s;t, in a world of &s;pirits, and had &s;carce taken a &s;eat, when &s;he a&s;ked after the charming fellow who entertained her &s;o agreeably in the &s;hop.</P>
<P>Henrietta told her, &s;he &s;aw no more of him;
<Q>for the moment you was gone, &s;aid &s;he, I went up &s;tairs; but really, my dear, I won|der you &s;eemed &s;o plea&s;ed with his conver&s;a|tion, methought it was very &s;illy and trifling.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh!" exclaimed mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>there is an inexpre&s;&s;ible charm in the trifling chat of a pretty &s;en&s;ible fellow, when we know he &s;ubmits to it only to plea&s;e us women.</Q></P>
<P>"Truly," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>your &s;ex is not obliged to you for that compliment. Mu&s;t a man then talk non&s;en&s;e to be acceptable to
<PB N="112" REF="123">
us.</Q>
"Lord, how grave you are! my dear," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby&mdash;
<Q>why don't you know that I am the verie&s;t coquet in nature, and take an infinite plea&s;ure in making a wi&s;e man look and talk like a fool.</Q></P>
<P>"A coquet, my dear!" interrupted Henrietta, &s;urpri&s;ed, "no, &s;urely." "Indeed but I am," replied mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>and I verily think! &s;hould not be in the lea&s;t concerned to &s;ee a hundred men dying of love for me.</Q>
<Q>In|deed!</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney.
<Q>Yes, in|deed,</Q>
repeated the other;
<Q>but why that &s;tare of a&s;toni&s;hment? are the&s;e notions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o new to you?</Q>
"Why, no&mdash;" he&s;itated mi&s;s Courteney (who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hment aro&s;e from the contemplation of the figure which uttered all this extravagance)
<Q>I have &s;omewhere met in my cour&s;e of reading with &s;uch fanta&s;tical notions, but I cannot &s;ay that I ever thought I &s;hould hear them avowed by a young lady of your good &s;en&s;e.</Q>
<Q>Oh! your &s;ervant for that compliment,</Q>
returned mi&s;s Woodby, bow|ing;
<Q>but on the article of vanity we are all fools.&mdash;But come, my dear, make your tea, and then re&s;ume your &s;tory; for I die with impatience to hear it.</Q></P>
<P>"I wi&s;h you would excu&s;e me," &s;aid Hen|rietta,
<Q>till I am got to Mrs. Egret's, for I &s;hall
<PB N="113" REF="124">
not be ea&s;y till I am out of this hou&s;e.</Q>
"Why have you &s;uch a di&s;like to this hou&s;e?" &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>I prote&s;t I think your landlady a mighty civil, obliging woman.</Q>
"Well, I don't like her," replied Henrietta,
<Q>&s;he has let her fir&s;t floor all on a &s;udden to the gentleman we &s;aw in the &s;hop.</Q>
<Q>And how does that affect you?</Q>
interrupted mi&s;s Woodby.</P>
<P>Henrietta blu&s;hed at this que&s;tion; &s;he was not willing to own that &s;he thought there was &s;ome de&s;ign in his coming, and expected her friend would have made that inference her&s;elf; but finding &s;he did not, &s;he endeavoured to di|vert her attention from the hint &s;he had dropped, by &s;aying &s;he had &s;et her heart upon going to Mrs. Egret's, and had told Mrs. Eccles that &s;he was to leave her to-day.</P>
<P>"That was very imprudently done of you," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>before you knew whether Mrs. Egret could accommodate you with lodgings; but own the truth now,</Q>
pur&s;ued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,
<Q>did you not put your&s;elf into a flutter upon hearing the gentleman had taken lodg|ings here?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why, I cannot help &s;aying I was &s;tartled at it,</Q>
replied Henrietta,
<Q>and the more when I heard he was a man of quality; for
<PB N="114" REF="125">
&s;urely the&s;e lodgings are much too mean for a per&s;on of that rank.</Q></P>
<P>"Is he a man of quality?" exclaimed mi&s;s Woodby&mdash;
<Q>Oh! the dear creature&mdash;I pro|te&s;t I am quite in love with him now; I do at on a man of quality&mdash; And pray why &s;hould his coming fright you away.&mdash;Ah! my dear,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, &s;miling archly,
<Q>had I not rea&s;on for &s;aying a moment ago, that on the article of vanity we are all fools? Now are you ready to imagine here is a plot between this young nobleman and Mrs. Eccles again&s;t your fair &s;elf. Poor lady,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, laughing,
<Q>this pre&s;umptuous knight will certainly carry you away.</Q></P>
<P>"You are in a gay humour to-day," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, blu&s;hing,
<Q>but raillery a-part, it imports me greatly not to be known: this lord, as Mrs. Eccles &s;ays he is, will no doubt have a great many per&s;ons coming after him; I may be &s;een and di&s;covered, and, if you knew what I have to dread in that ca&s;e, I am &s;ure you would think it rea&s;onable for me to be anxious to get out of this hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You will be in more danger of a di&s;covery at Mrs. Egret's,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hou&s;e is much larger than this, and &s;he very &s;eldom without people of fa&s;hion in it.
<PB N="115" REF="126">
But I can keep in my chamber,</Q>
&s;aid Hen|rietta.
<Q>And what hinders you from doing &s;o here,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Woodby&mdash;
<Q>Ah! it is as I &s;u&s;pected; you are certainly apprehen&s;ive of being conveyed to &s;ome i&s;land in an immen&s;e lake.</Q></P>
<P>"But my dear mi&s;s Woodby," &s;aid Hen|rietta, laughing,
<Q>why, have you changed your mind about my going to Mrs. Egret's?</Q>
"I have not changed my mind," replied mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>I am ready to do what I pro|mi&s;ed, but it is my opinion that if Mrs. Egret cannot furni&s;h you with a lodging, you will be very &s;afe here, and I will be with you as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> often as I can.</Q>
"Ah, my dear," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, mimicking the tone &s;he had u&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er;
<Q>but come write a line to Mrs. Egret to know if &s;he has a &s;ingle room to &s;pare, and I &s;hall be &s;atisfied.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Woodby immediately complied with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r reque&s;t, and a porter was di&s;patched to St. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mes's-&s;treet, who &s;oon returned with a billet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om Mrs. Egret to mi&s;s Woodby, expre&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r concern that &s;he could not accommodate her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end.</P>
<P>Well," &s;aid Henrietta, when &s;he heard this, I find I mu&s;t be contented to &s;tay here a few days longer; but remember I claim your pro|mi&s;e

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our heroine engages her&s;elf in a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y unequal conte&s;t.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"I Mu&s;t confe&s;s," &s;aid mi&s;s Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ency, re|&s;uming her narrative,
<Q>that I had no in|clination to engage in a religious di&s;pute with a man who&s;e learning and abilities gave him &s;o many advantages over me; therefore when|ever he gave the conver&s;ation that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. I ge|nerally took refuge in &s;ilence, not being will|ing to hurt a cau&s;e I had &s;o much at heart, by defending it weakly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>However I was often drawn in to an&s;wer by &s;ome apparent ab&s;urdity advanced by him, which it &s;eemed mighty ea&s;y to refute. On the&s;e occa&s;ions Mr. Danvers would li&s;ten to me with wonderful attention, ob&s;erve the mo&s;t minute exactne&s;s in his reply, as if what I had urged had indeed great force: nay,
<PB N="117" REF="128">
he would &s;ometimes &s;eem a little pre&s;t by my arguments; pau&s;e for a few moments, as if he found it nece&s;&s;ary to collect all his &s;trength again&s;t &s;o potent an adver&s;ary; and after a well-turned compliment on my under&s;tand|ing, he would re&s;ume the argument, in which he never failed to puzzle, though he could not convince me; but always concluded with a declaration that I was too hard for him, and it was well he had the be&s;t &s;ide of the argu|ment, for nothing but truth could &s;tand a|gain&s;t &s;uch &s;ubtilty of rea&s;oning.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e prai&s;es always left me in a very good di&s;po&s;ition to renew the &s;ubject whenever an opportunity offered. I began to be extremely fond of di&s;puting with the chaplain; and, in|&s;tead of &s;hunning it, as I u&s;ed to do, I even invited his oppo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have heard it ob&s;erved that vanity cheats many a woman out of her honour, I am &s;ure it was well nigh cheating me out of my reli|gion; for this je&s;uit by his in&s;idious prai&s;es had given me &s;uch a confidence in my talent of rea&s;oning, that I began to believe if he did not make a pro&s;elyte of me, I &s;hould cer|tainly make one of him; and, in my eager pur&s;uit of victory, I &s;ometimes engaged my|&s;elf
<PB N="118" REF="129">
beyond my &s;trength, and received &s;uch checks, that if my faith was not overthrown, yet it was &s;trangely &s;taggered: but &s;ome di&s;|gu&s;t which I took to the manners of the chap|lain pre&s;erved me from the poi&s;on of his doc|trine, and made me lo&s;e all my reli&s;h for arguing with him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt, who was certainly very de&s;irous of my conver&s;ion, was much plea&s;ed with her chaplain's zeal to forward &s;o great a work; and that &s;he might give no inter|ruption to our di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he would often leave us alone for &s;everal hours together.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At &s;uch times, the je&s;uit would be very lavi&s;h of his compliments and prai&s;es; of which my per&s;on would even come in for a &s;hare&mdash; He would gaze on my face till he lo&s;t the chain of his di&s;cour&s;e, and, by his inattention to what he was &s;aying, gave me many advantages over him; and often, while he was pur&s;uing his argument with great warmth, he would lay his hand on mine, hold it for &s;everal minutes together, and pre&s;s it &s;o violently, that I could hardly help cry|ing out.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All this, however, would not have &s;tartled me; but one day, taking occa&s;ion upon &s;ome|thing I had &s;aid to break into an exclamation
<PB N="119" REF="130">
of &s;urpri&s;e, at my prodigious under&s;tanding, he ki&s;&s;ed my hand in a kind of rapture; and having once taken this liberty, he repeated it &s;everal times, to my great confu&s;ion and &s;ur|pri&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e are &s;u&s;picions, my dear, which, again&s;t per&s;ons of a certain character, one dare not even avow to one's &s;elf. I was &s;hocked, yet would not venture to examine why; I could never endure to be alone with him, yet never a&s;ked my&s;elf the rea&s;on; my eyes, as it were, mechanically avoided his; his civilities were odious to me. If he enquired after my health, I an&s;wered him coldly, without know|ing I did &s;o; and when he launched into any of his u&s;ual prai&s;es, I was downright rude to him, yet &s;carce perceived it my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I now &s;o carefully &s;hunned being alone with him, that notwith&s;tanding he &s;ought op|portunities of engaging me in private, which heightened my di&s;gu&s;t, yet he never could find any. This conduct, if he had any guilt in his heart, mu&s;t certainly give him cau&s;e to think I had detected it; and indeed I &s;oon found, by my aunt's altered behaviour, that he was endeavouring to undermine me in her affection.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="131">
<Q>The little peevi&s;hne&s;s I ob&s;erved in her to|wards me, I imputed at fir&s;t to her chagrin, at my having di&s;appointed her wi&s;hes in not becoming a convert to that religion &s;he pro|fe&s;&s;ed; but I &s;oon found that &s;he had been made to conceive &s;trange notions of me. She objected to the gaiety of my di&s;po&s;ition; &s;he did not like that crowd of lovers, as &s;he phra&s;ed it, that followed me, and were en|couraged by my coquet airs, and the plea&s;ure I &s;hewed in being admired.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is certain, that the report of the fortune my aunt de&s;igned for me, procured me ad|dre&s;&s;es from &s;everal men, whom as &s;he did not approve, &s;o neither did I encourage; having, in reality, none of that &s;ort of vanity which is gratified by a great many pretenders of this kind, nor did I feel the lea&s;t partiality to any one of them; &s;o that I told her it would give me no unea&s;ine&s;s if &s;he forbid their vi&s;its for the future, which, &s;ince I found they were di&s;agreeable to her, I would have done my&s;elf, if I had thought it became me to take that li|berty in her hou&s;e. This declaration would not &s;atisfy my aunt: &s;he had further views; I mu&s;t marry, and &s;he mu&s;t choo&s;e a hu&s;band for me, without leaving me in an affair that &s;o

nearly concerned my happine&s;s, even a nega|tive voice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have no doubt but that the per&s;on &s;he pitched upon was recommended to her by the chaplain; he was a Roman catholic baronet, had a good e&s;tate, was not much above &s;ixty years of age, his per&s;on ju&s;t not horrible, and he was not quite a fool. This was the man whom my aunt propo&s;ed to me, or rather commanded me to accept; for he had mo|de&s;ty enough not to try to engage my affec|tions, till he had &s;ecured her con&s;ent, and was admitted in form to make his addre&s;&s;es to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt indeed allowed that there was &s;ome di&s;proportion in our years; but then he had a good e&s;tate, and I was wholly dependent upon her; his per&s;on, &s;he acknowledged, was not very amiable, but he was a baronet, and could give me a title; to be &s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, he was not a man of bright parts, but he would make a good &s;ettlement on me; and concluded with a&s;&s;uring me, that my chearful con&s;ent would greatly endear me to her, which I &s;hould find by the di&s;po&s;ition &s;he would make in her will.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt, having thus anticipated every objection I could make, and, in her opinion,
<PB N="122" REF="133">
fully an&s;wered them all, I thought it would be to no purpo&s;e to di&s;pute with her on points already decided; I therefore contented my|&s;elf with declaring, that I could not like Sir I&s;aac Darby (for that was his name); that I &s;hould be mi&s;erable, if I married him; that I was extremely happy in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and had no wi&s;h to change it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lady Meadows, I perceived, was a little offended at this &s;o po&s;itive a declaration; but, I had nothing for it but &s;teadine&s;s. I expected, &s;aid &s;he, more compliance from that &s;weet|ne&s;s I have been fond of &s;uppo&s;ing in your temper, and from your good &s;en&s;e, a greater attention to your own intere&s;t. I a&s;&s;ured her, that it was and ever &s;hould be my &s;incere&s;t endeavour to avoid offending her; that I would admit no offer but &s;uch as &s;he &s;hould approve; and that I would guard my heart again&s;t any preference which was not au|thori&s;ed by her; more than this I told her was not in my power to promi&s;e, for no con&s;idera|tion of intere&s;t could prevail upon me to give my hand to a man, whom it was impo&s;&s;ible for me either to love or e&s;teem.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Finding &s;he li&s;tened to me patiently, I urged every argument my imagination could furni&s;h me with, to prove to her that &s;uch an engage|ment,
<PB N="123" REF="134">
entered into upon pecuniary motives only, could not be happy, and might be very mi&s;erable. I begged &s;he would not think of di&s;po&s;ing of me in marriage, till I &s;eemed le&s;s &s;atisfied with my pre&s;ent happy lot; and that, by giving me no &s;uperior duties in dome&s;tic life to fulfil, &s;he might entitle her&s;elf to all my undivided cares, affection, and a&s;&s;iduity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt &s;eemed affected with what I &s;aid: &s;he told me &s;he had no intention of forcing my inclination; that, loving me &s;o well as &s;he did, it was natural for her to wi&s;h to &s;ee me &s;ettled; that Sir I&s;aac Darby was a very ad|vantageous offer; &s;he recommended to me to con&s;ider well what I refu&s;ed, and to conquer my unrea&s;onable di&s;like of him, if po&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it were po&s;&s;ible, madam, replied I, your command would make me attempt it, but&mdash; No more buts now, Henrietta, interrupted my aunt&mdash;Sir I&s;aac dines here to-day; re|member I expect you will treat him civilly at lea&s;t, &s;ince he has &s;o great a regard for you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;miled, courte&s;ied, and went out of the where this long conver&s;ation had been hold; for I heard the chaplain's &s;tep in my aunt's dre&s;&s;ing-room; and this being the hour when he generally joined us, I cho&s;e to avoid &s;eeing him then, for fear he &s;hould prevail upon her
<PB N="124" REF="135">
to exact &s;omething more than civility from me to the odious wretch, who had thus bartered for me without my con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I did not appear in the dining-room till dinner was ready to be &s;erved; my antiquated lover approached with a janty air, and a &s;liding bow; and O! don't you pity me, my dear, ki&s;&s;ed my hand, as he led me to my &s;eat. Nothing but the re&s;pect I owed my aunt could have hindered me from laughing, at this ridiculous di&s;play of gallantry in the old man; for age has no claim to our reverence, if not accompanied by tho&s;e qualities from whence it derives its worth. Wi&s;dom, gra|vity, experience, the triumph of rea&s;on over pa&s;&s;ions, prejudice, and folly: all the&s;e we expect to find in fulne&s;s of years, and the&s;e make its wrinkles not only re&s;pectable but even lovely.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In Sir I&s;aac Darby, age was contemptible as well as unlovely; he wanted to be young, in &s;pite of time; he talked and laughed aloud; he &s;trutted about the room; he adju&s;ted his bag, for he was dre&s;t up to five and twenty; he hummed a tune: I &s;at &s;taring with a&s;toni&s;h|ment at him. When we were placed at table, I found my&s;elf oppo&s;ite to him; and ob&s;erving that he chewed his meat with great difficulty,
<PB N="125" REF="136">
for want of teeth, I was re&s;olved to mortify him, by letting him perceive that I ob&s;erved it, looking at him &s;everal times with a kind of &s;en&s;ibility for this &s;o unavoidable a misfortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From what had pa&s;&s;ed between my aunt and I in the morning, I had no rea&s;on to ima|gine that Sir I&s;aac would be treated as a de|clared and authori&s;ed lover; but &s;ome time after dinner was over, Mr. Danvers withdrew, and my aunt, upon &s;ome trifling pretence, following him, I was left alone with the old baronet. I would in&s;tantly have quitted the room; but, remembring that my aunt had re|quired civility of me at lea&s;t, I re&s;olved not to affront him, by leaving him to him&s;elf; and &s;ince I was obliged to &s;tay, I would draw &s;ome amu&s;ement from the ridiculous &s;cene be|fore me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know not whether it was from any particu|lar archne&s;s in my looks ju&s;t then (for I had compo&s;ed my countenance to a kind of forced gravity) or whether the old man was at a lo&s;s in what manner he &s;hould form his addre&s;s; but it is certain, that all his confidence &s;eemed now, for the fir&s;t time, to for&s;ake him, and he &s;at &s;ilent during &s;everal minutes, &s;tealing a glance at me every now and then; while I, with a formal air, played my fan, and in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="126" REF="137">
his confu&s;ion by my &s;ilence. At length he quitted his own chair for that which my aunt had &s;at in, and which was next me; and drawing it &s;till nearer to me, he made a mo|tion to take my hand, which I withdrew as ha&s;tily as if a &s;nake had touched it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This action a little di&s;concerted him; but taking courage again, after a preluding hem, he began, Charming mi&s;s Courteney, I don't doubt but lady Meadows has informed you of the violence of my&mdash;Here an unlucky cough interrupted his &s;peech, and held him &s;o long, that he grew black in the face; his endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s it having, as I believe, almo&s;t choaked him. I ro&s;e up in a &s;eeming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, as if I had de&s;igned to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but finding his cough had cea&s;ed, I &s;at down again at a greater di&s;tance than before.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I fancy the town air does not agree with you, &s;ir, &s;aid I, it is certainly very bad for a&s;thmatical di&s;orders.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, madam! &s;aid he, this is no a&s;thma. I got a &s;light cold the other night at Spring-Gardens; for we &s;taid very late, and the ground was damp: but I came off better than any of my companions, two or three of whom are &s;till laid up with colds. But tell me, dear mi&s;s Courteney, did you receive favourably
<PB N="127" REF="138">
the declaration your aunt made in my name? may I hope, or am I doomed to de&s;pair? whined out the &s;uperannuated enamorato, with an hideous ogle, which he de&s;igned for a lan|gui&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, good &s;ir! replied I, exce&s;&s;ively &s;hocked at his folly, the&s;e Arcadian &s;trains do not be|come your wi&s;dom and gravity. My aunt did mention your propo&s;als to me, but, I cannot accept them; I have no inclination to change my condition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How admirably this pretty &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s &s;its on tho&s;e &s;weet features! &s;aid the wretch, looking confidently at me, without being in the lea&s;t mortified with my rebuke. But my dear mi&s;s Courteney, you mu&s;t change your mind&mdash;indeed you mu&s;t&mdash;and your condition too, my fair one.</Q></P>
<P>"Perhaps I may, &s;ir, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Oh, that charming perhaps! &s;aid he, it re|&s;tores "me to life.</P>
<P><Q>Was there ever any thing &s;o provoking, my dear? I prote&s;t I could hardly help abu&s;|ing the ridiculous old man.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I really think, &s;ir, &s;aid I, looking at him with infinite contempt, that my &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s would become your age, as well as my youth; but, pur&s;ued I, ri&s;ing, to put an end to all
<PB N="128" REF="139">
your hopes, be plea&s;ed to know, that I am determined never to give my hand till I can give my heart with it; for I have no no|tion of being perjured at the altar, and of vowing to love, honour and obey, when it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to do either.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I went out of the room when I had &s;aid the&s;e words, leaving the baronet to mumble the ends of his fingers with his gums; for he affected to bite his nails, as &s;ome per|&s;ons who really have teeth, do, when they are angry.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I met my aunt as I was going to my own chamber: What, Henrietta! &s;aid &s;he, have you left &s;ir I&s;aac alone?&mdash; I &s;uppo&s;e you have treated him rudely; but come, you mu&s;t re|turn with me&mdash; I will, if you in&s;i&s;t upon it, madam, &s;aid I, but I had much rather be excu&s;ed&mdash; Indeed! &s;aid my aunt, looking a little angrily on me, and with that grave face too, but I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon it, mi&s;s, and &s;o you may go up to your own room if you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Although I was very glad to be at liberty to retire, yet my aunt's permi&s;&s;ion was given in &s;uch a manner that I &s;aw &s;he was offended with me for de&s;iring it. I had experienced
<PB N="129" REF="140">
the ob&s;tinacy of her temper on &s;everal occa|&s;ions; and I was convinced that if &s;he &s;et her heart upon marrying me to the baronet, &s;he would u&s;e her utmo&s;t endeavours to carry her point, and the lo&s;s of her favour might pro|bably be the con&s;equence of her di&s;appoint|ment.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing an account of &s;ome difficulties our he|roine was involved in, ari&s;ing from an old ex|ploded notion, that intere&s;t ought not to be the &s;ole con&s;ideration in marriage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>FULL of the&s;e melancholy reflections, I re&s;olved to write to Mr. Bale, acquaint him with what had pa&s;&s;ed, and intreat his advice in the unea&s;y and perplexed &s;tate of my mind. Not that I had the lea&s;t intention of being governed by it, if he recommended to me compliance with my aunt's commands in favour of the baronet; but this I was well a&s;&s;ured, from his good &s;en&s;e and natural rec|titude of mind, he would not do, &s;ince it could never be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch a man could be my choice; but I was willing to &s;tand clear in his opinion, and pay him that deference,
<PB N="130" REF="141">
that was due to the quality of guardian which he had &s;o kindly a&s;&s;umed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I had been writing near three hours, for I had given him a circum&s;tantial detail of every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed with regard to the ba|ronet, who&s;e character I treated with great contempt; but what was wor&s;e, my aunt her&s;elf did not e&s;cape &s;ome &s;atirical &s;trokes of my pen for her ready concurrence with the old man's propo&s;als; and although I men|tioned her (as it was my duty) with all ima|ginable love and re&s;pect, yet I could not help humorou&s;ly raillying upon &s;ome of her notions, which were really odd enough, and I placed them in the mo&s;t glaring light.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The prodigious length of my letter fir&s;t gave me notice that I had been a long time thus employed; and, looking at my watch, I found it was pa&s;t our u&s;ual hour for tea, and wondered that I had not been &s;ummoned down &s;tairs. I therefore made ha&s;te to con|clude my letter, that I might &s;end it to the po&s;t, when my aunt unfortunately entered the room. I &s;tarted up from my chair when I &s;aw her; and, ha&s;tily cru&s;hing the letter all in my hand, I put it into my pocket, not without betraying &s;ome &s;igns of confu|&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="142">
<Q>So, Henrietta, &s;aid my aunt, have I caught you? Caught me! madam, &s;aid I, con|&s;idering whether &s;he might not have been looking over my &s;houlder while I was writ|ing &s;o &s;aucily about her; for guilt like love makes every thing &s;eem po&s;&s;ible that we fear. Yes, &s;aid &s;he, have you not been writing? Nay, don't deny it, pur&s;ued &s;he (for I he&s;i|tated and knew not what to &s;ay, left &s;he &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;ee my letter) it is no won|der that poor &s;ir I&s;aac Darby was rejected with &s;o much &s;corn, when there is a fa|voured lover with whom you corre&s;pond privately.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ble&s;s me, madam, cried I, who has told you &s;o? I corre&s;pond privately with a fa|voured lover!&mdash; This is &s;ome cruel calumny invented by an enemy to deprive me of your good opinion. Well, &s;aid my aunt, &s;hew me the letter you conveyed &s;o ha&s;tily into your pocket upon my appearance, and then I &s;hall know what to think.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You never, madam, replied I, u&s;ed to de|&s;ire to &s;ee my letters; nor would you now, but in con&s;equence of &s;ome &s;u&s;picion very un|favourable to me. That &s;u&s;picion, inter|rupted my aunt, whatever it is, will be greatly
<PB N="132" REF="143">
&s;trengthened by your refu&s;ing to &s;hew me what you have been writing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Surely, madam, replied I, that is not ju&s;t, I may have been writing to Mr. Bale, or to my brother. To your brother, &s;aid my aunt, I am certain you was not writing, becau&s;e you have not heard from him for &s;e|veral months, and don't know how to direct to him (which indeed was but too true). It is po&s;&s;ible that you were writing to Mr. Bale; but why refu&s;e to &s;hew me your letter? you can have no tran&s;actions with him that I ought not to be acquainted with: but I am per&s;uaded that letter was not de&s;igned for Mr. Bale; and there needs no more to convince me that you are carrying on a private, and therefore an improper corre&s;pondence, than your thus ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to &s;hew it me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt had rea&s;on for what &s;he &s;aid: nothing was more ea&s;y, if I was really inno|cent, than to &s;hew her the letter, which would remove her &s;u&s;picions; but this, as I had managed that fatal letter, it was impo&s;|&s;ible for me to do. By not &s;hewing it, I confirmed tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions &s;he had &s;o unju&s;tly conceived, which might indeed have di&s;agree|able con&s;equences; but by &s;hewing it, I was
<PB N="133" REF="144">
&s;ure to incur her re&s;entment for the liberties I had taken with her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How did I that moment inwardly regret my vanity, which had &s;uffered me to railly the faults of a per&s;on on whom I &s;o ab&s;o|lutely depended, merely to di&s;play my wit. I was &s;o vexed at the dilemma to which I had reduced my&s;elf, that I bur&s;t into tears.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! I &s;ee how it is, &s;aid my aunt, keep your letter, Henrietta, I am convinced &s;uf|ficiently. She hurried out of my chamber at the&s;e words. Shocked to the &s;oul at having thus incurred the imputation of entertaining a &s;ecret lover, I went after her, re&s;olving in that fir&s;t emotion to &s;hew her the letter, and rather be thought ungrateful to her, than guilty of an imprudence &s;o di&s;advantageous to my character; but &s;he was already at the bottom of the &s;tairs, and I had time to make new reflections which prevented my former purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I con&s;idered that &s;ince there was no foun|dation for her fears that I li&s;tened to a private addre&s;s, I might ea&s;ily find means to unde|ceive her, and ju&s;tify my&s;elf; but if I &s;hewed her a letter, in which &s;he was mentioned with &s;o great freedom, I might po&s;&s;ibly never be able to remove tho&s;e ill impre&s;&s;ions of me
<PB N="134" REF="145">
which &s;he would doubtle&s;s receive, and I &s;hould be all my life branded for ingratitude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was &s;o terrified at this thought, that I re|&s;olved to put it out of my power to expo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my&s;elf to &s;uch a misfortune by de&s;troying the fatal letter, which I did with a precipitation that left no time for &s;econd thoughts. When this was over, I expected to have found my|&s;elf more calm and ea&s;y, but it was quite otherwi&s;e. I had given foundation to be|lieve that I was engaged in a love-intrigue; for &s;urely all clande&s;tine addre&s;&s;es may be termed &s;o, &s;ince there is too much my&s;tery, contrivance, and little arts, nece&s;&s;ary to them, not to give great pain to a delicate mind. I bur&s;t into tears at the reflection. My aunt's woman, who had a very tender regard for me, came into my chamber, and, finding me &s;o di&s;ordered, begged to know what had happened.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I related every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween my aunt and I, but did not own to all the little freedoms I had taken with her in my letter; yet &s;aid enough to convince her, that I could not well &s;how it to my aunt.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mrs. White, for that was her name, was very much concerned for my &s;ituation: &s;he told me, that her lady and Mr. Danvers were
<PB N="135" REF="146">
in clo&s;e conference. It is certainly he, &s;aid &s;he, who has infu&s;ed the&s;e &s;u&s;picions into my lady, which, by this unfortunate circum|&s;tance of the letter, are now confirmed: &s;he gave me &s;uch plain hints of the chaplain's &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;itions and de&s;igns, that it &s;eemed highly probable he would &s;pare no artifices to le&s;&s;en my aunt's affection for me; for, &s;ince he had failed in making me a convert, which perhaps might have an&s;wered other views, he was de&s;irous of keeping my aunt entirely to him&s;elf, and &s;o manage her con&s;cience, which he had the direction of, as that holy mother-church and he might divide her &s;poils.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All this con&s;idered, my condition &s;eemed &s;o dangerous, that I begged Mrs. White to &s;end a porter with a me&s;&s;age from me to Mr. Bale, de&s;iring to &s;ee him; for I re&s;olved to regulate my conduct on this occa&s;ion wholly by his advice. She left me to do what I had de&s;ired her; and I remained alone in my chamber till nine o'clock, at which time I was &s;ummoned to &s;upper.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I found only my aunt and Mr. Danvers: I was a little confu&s;ed; for knowing what &s;u&s;|picions I laboured under in my aunt's mind, I thought I had the air of a guilty per&s;on, and
<PB N="136" REF="147">
I felt that I blu&s;hed, and blu&s;hed the more for that rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt looked very coldly upon me; Mr. Danvers looked like one that was very much concerned that all was not well between us: my aunt &s;carce &s;poke three words during &s;upper; it was not my part &s;urely to talk much; and Mr. Danvers accommodated him&s;elf to the pre&s;ent temper of my aunt; &s;o that this was a very gloomy meal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When the cloth was removed, I was going to withdraw, for it &s;eemed as if my pre&s;ence was a re&s;traint upon my aunt; but I con&s;i|dered that &s;uch a &s;tep being unu&s;ual, would imply a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;omething wrong in me, and that being innocent, it was my part to &s;eck an explanation. I therefore addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to my aunt, and begged &s;he would give me an opportunity of clearing my&s;elf, by te&s;t|ing me who had poi&s;oned her mind with &s;u&s;|picions to my prejudice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The chaplain was about to leave the room upon my entering on this &s;ubject. There is no nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ir, &s;aid I, for your r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g I dare &s;ay the cau&s;e of my aunt's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t me is no &s;ecret to you.

<PB N="137" REF="148">
him; I declare this to be ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, and I beg to know from whom you had your infor|mation, madam, &s;aid I, again directing my|&s;elf to her, that I may refu&s;e this calumny; I am very confident the per&s;on who has thus ma|liciou&s;ly injured me, will not dare to maintain the fal&s;hood to my face.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whether the chaplain thought this was meant for him, I know not; but although he had continued &s;tanding, as if he intended to leave us to our&s;elves, yet I had no &s;ooner uttered the&s;e la&s;t words than he re&s;umed his &s;eat im|mediately, as if he would &s;hew me he was not in the lea&s;t affected by them; but I ob&s;erved that he fixed his eyes upon my aunt, and ex|pected her an&s;wer with &s;ome emotion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Before I comply with your condition, &s;aid my aunt, do you, Henrietta, agree to mine; let me &s;ee that letter you wrote to-day. I looked at the chaplain; I &s;aw an alteration in his countenance, he was evidently more com|po&s;ed. Oh! thought I, &s;ighing, how great would my triumph be, if I had this letter to &s;how, and could &s;how it without fear!</Q></P>
<P><Q>You he&s;itate, Henrietta, pur&s;ued my aunt, why, if that letter was not to a lover, why do you refu&s;e to produce it? I declare, madam, &s;aid I, upon my word and honour, that the

<P><Q>My aunt looked down, pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed not wholly di&s;&s;atisfied with my manner of ac|counting for the reluctance I &s;hewed to deliver my letter to her; but before &s;he would declare her&s;elf, it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould con&s;ult her oracle, and that could not be done before me. She therefore put an end to the conver|&s;ation, by ringing the bell for her woman. I attended her to her chamber, at the door of
<PB N="139" REF="150">
which &s;he bade me good night, telling me, &s;he would talk further with me in the morn|ing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I endeavoured to make Mrs. White com|prehend, by a look I gave her unob&s;erved, that I wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her; and according|ly &s;he came to me, after my aunt was in bed, and delivered the an&s;wer the porter had brought from Mr. Bale's; he was out of town, but expected back in a week or two, was what the &s;ervants told him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mrs. White repeated her offers of &s;ervice to me, but dropped &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions that &s;hewed &s;he would be glad to be a&s;&s;ured that I really had no &s;ecret engagement which might ju&s;tify my aunt's concern.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e doubts hinted with great re&s;pect, were &s;o far from being re&s;ented by me, that I conceived the better opinion of her di&s;cretion, and confided ab&s;olutely in her &s;incerity. I made her quite ea&s;y with regard to the &s;ubject of her fears; and &s;he repaid this conde&s;cen&s;ion with the kinde&s;t a&s;&s;urances of attachment to me and care of my intere&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I went to bed, full of hope that I had in part removed my aunt's &s;u&s;picions, and re|lying on my innocence, I was per&s;uaded I &s;hould &s;oon re&s;tore my&s;elf to her good opinion;
<PB N="140" REF="151">
but innocence is not always a &s;ecurity to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, becau&s;e malice attains its ends by arts, which a good mind cannot conceive, and there|fore is unable to guard again&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mrs. White informed me in a whi&s;per, as I was going into my aunt's dre&s;&s;ing-room next morning, where we always breakfa&s;ted, that her lady and the chaplain had been talking together for half an hour. I drew no favour|able omen from this intelligence, nor from my aunt's looks, which were very cold and con&s;trained.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When breakfa&s;t was over, and Mr. Dan|vers had withdrawn, I expected &s;he would enter into &s;ome conver&s;ation with me on the &s;ubject of the letter; but finding &s;he talked of different things, I took occa&s;ion to mention it my&s;elf, and begged to know if &s;he had any doubts &s;till remaining in her mind.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Surely, replied my aunt, you think I am a per&s;on that can be very ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon. Then you are re&s;olved, madam, &s;aid I, with &s;ome peevi&s;hne&s;s (for indeed I was horridly vexed to find her &s;o &s;trongly prejudiced) to believe I encourage a clande&s;tine addre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding every appearance to the con|trary.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="152">
<Q>No indeed, interrupted my aunt, I am not &s;o unrea&s;onable, mi&s;s; it is becau&s;e there are very &s;trong appearances again&s;t you, that I am forced to believe what you would not have me&mdash;that letter, Henrietta&mdash;but no more on this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, I am going to my hou&s;e near Wind&s;or-fore&s;t to-morrow; we &s;hall there have lei&s;ure enough to talk over this affair, and there I &s;hall open my mind freely to you. I courti&s;ied and was &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt took me with her to pay &s;ome morning vi&s;its, and &s;eemed to be in very good humour; but her words, that &s;he would open her mind freely to me at Wind&s;or, gave me a great deal of anxiety. I did not doubt but I was to be pre&s;t again on the &s;ubject of &s;ir I&s;aac Darby, and I was prepared for an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance; but I was apprehen&s;ive that this re&s;i&s;tance to my aunt's will, meet|ing with the unaccountable &s;u&s;picions &s;he had entertained, would infallibly ruin me with her. O my brother! thought I, why are you not here to countenance and protect me; or why have you &s;o long neglected me, as to leave me in &s;u&s;pence whether I have a brother or not!</Q></P>
<P><Q>This thought, and &s;everal others no le&s;s painful, &s;pread an air of pen&s;ivene&s;s and me|lancholy
<PB N="142" REF="153">
on my countenance, which my aunt, as I perceived, by &s;ome hints that dropped from her, interpreted to my di&s;advantage. In &s;hort, my dear, &s;he imputed my pen&s;ive|ne&s;s to the concern I was under at leaving town, as I could not expect to have many op|portunities of &s;eeing at Wind&s;or this lover that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You cannot imagine, mi&s;s Woodby, how much I &s;uffered in being obliged to re&s;train my indignation at being thus treated: to have a phantom of a lover conjured up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me with, and to combat &s;u&s;picions which had not the lea&s;t foundation, but in prejudice and caprice, again&s;t which plain truth and rea&s;on were very unequal arms: for how &s;hould rea|&s;on remove what would never have been ad|mitted, if rea&s;on had not been fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nothing was ever more improbable than that I &s;hould have a &s;ecret lover: I never went<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> where without my aunt; her vi&s;itors were mine; I could &s;ee no body without her know|ledge: how was this engagement formed? But her chaplain had doubtle&s;s a&s;&s;ured her, that I had a &s;ecret engagement, and &s;he piou&s;|ly believed him, in contradiction to her own judgment: this was one of tho&s;e ca&s;es that re|quired an implicit faith; and in matters of

<P><Q>We &s;et out next morning for Wind&s;or, the chaplain and my aunt's woman being in the coach, the conver&s;ation was wholly upon in|different things. After dinner was over, my aunt took me into her clo&s;et, and entered into a long di&s;cour&s;e, which it would tire you to repeat&mdash; but the &s;ub&s;tance of it was my un|happy &s;ituation, when &s;he took me out of the hands of lady Manning&mdash; her tenderne&s;s for me; the great things &s;he de&s;igned to do for me, nothing le&s;s than making me her &s;ole heir; the folly of marrying for love, exem|plified in my father's marriage; her fears that I was going to throw my&s;elf away on &s;ome young fop, who would make me mi&s;erable; &s;ir I&s;aac Darby's generous pa&s;&s;ion for me, his great e&s;tate, the hand&s;ome &s;ettlements he pro|po&s;ed to make; and la&s;tly, the plea&s;ure I would give her, by &s;uiting in this ca&s;e my in|clinations to my intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To all this I an&s;wered very particularly; I acknowledged &s;he had &s;hewn a parental ten|derne&s;s for me, and I had paid her, and ever would pay her, I &s;aid, the duty and obedience due from a child to a parent: that in the ar|ticle of marriage, my natural parents would

certainly have allowed me a negative voice, which was all I claimed now, &s;ince I was ab|&s;olutely re&s;olved not only never to marry with|out her con&s;ent, but not to admit of any ad|dre&s;s which &s;he di&s;approved. I begged her never to propo&s;e &s;ir I&s;aac Darby to me again, becau&s;e my heart wholly rejected him; tho' at the &s;ame time I prote&s;ted (as I might well do) that my affections were entirely di&s;engaged.</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our heroine is very rea&s;onably alarmed.</P>

<P><Q>IT was indeed true that my father's family took no notice of me, notwith&s;tanding the applications that had been made to them; and when my aunt Meadows introduced me at my uncle's the earl of&mdash;, I was received &s;o coldly by him and his lady, that I inly re|&s;olved never to expo&s;e my&s;elf to &s;uch a mor|tification again, and my aunt entered &s;o far into my ju&s;t re&s;entment as never to pre&s;s me to make them a &s;econd vi&s;it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My brother was abroad; if living he neg|lected me; and perhaps I had no brother; for how el&s;e could I account for &s;o long a &s;ilence in one who &s;eemed to have &s;uch tender affections?

alternative!&mdash; But the man con&s;idered, was there room to pau&s;e long?</Q></P>
<P><Q>My imagination &s;ugge&s;ted to me every po&s;|&s;ible ill con&s;equence of the lo&s;s of my aunt's favour, but weighed again&s;t the mi&s;ery of &s;uch a marriage, they all &s;eemed light&mdash;Yet would you think it, my dear, amid&s;t the many real evils I had rea&s;on to apprehend by di&s;obliging my aunt, one trifling circum&s;tance dwelt &s;tronge&s;t upon my mind, and that was the occa&s;ion of triumph I &s;hould give to lady Manning, who would exult over my fallen expectations and return to indigence. I was a&s;hamed of my own weakne&s;s when I found this thought capable of giving me &s;o much pain; and in the contemplation of greater mi&s;|fortunes which were likely to be my lot, I &s;ought to blunt my &s;en&s;e of the&s;e le&s;&s;er ones which were the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Towards evening Mrs. White threw her|&s;elf in my way, as I was walking pen&s;ive in the garden. She told me that my aunt was full of hopes that I would comply: that &s;ir I&s;aac was to be invited to-morrow; and that it was expected the genero&s;ity of his propo&s;als with regard to &s;ettlements, the rich pre&s;ents of jewels which he would offer, and his re&s;o|lution
<PB N="148" REF="159">
to agree to every thing I de&s;ired, would make &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, as to induce me to give a free and willing con&s;ent. Mrs. White added, that &s;ince my aunt was &s;o determined upon concluding this match, &s;he wi&s;hed I could conquer my aver&s;ion to it; for &s;he feared that my ab&s;olute refu&s;al would &s;o irritate her, that &s;he might be ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded to take &s;ome violent re&s;olution again&s;t me; and there is one, &s;aid &s;he, who will &s;pare no pains to bring that to pa&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I replied, that nothing which could befal me from the lo&s;s of my aunt's favour, was to be dreaded &s;o much as being the wi&s;e of &s;ir I&s;aac Darby; and that my re&s;olution was fixed. Mrs. White &s;ighed, &s;hrugged her &s;houlders, and ha&s;tened from me for fear of being ob|&s;erved, &s;eeming, as I thought, to believe my ca&s;e de&s;perate.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When &s;he was gone, I con&s;idered that if I accepted of the two days my aunt had given me to come to a re&s;olution, I &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed during that time to the odious court&s;hip of &s;ir I&s;aac, who&s;e pre&s;ence was, it &s;eems, judged nece&s;&s;ary to influence me; I therefore determined to declare my&s;elf immediately, and plunge at once into the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that awaited me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="160">
<Q>I left the garden in&s;tantly, and went in &s;earch of my aunt; as &s;oon as I entered the room where &s;he was, &s;he laid down a book &s;he had been reading, and looked earne&s;tly at me, &s;eeming, by my countenance on which I be|lieve was impre&s;&s;ed the agitation of my mind, to expect &s;omething extraordinary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have indulged me, madam, &s;aid I, with two days to con&s;ider of your propo&s;al with re|gard to &s;ir I&s;aac Darby; but &s;o long a time is not nece&s;&s;ary: were any thing le&s;s at &s;take than the future happine&s;s of my life, you &s;hould find me incapable of oppo&s;ing your will; but in this ca&s;e it is not po&s;&s;ible for me to obey you. Judge of my aver&s;ion to that man, when I pro|te&s;t to you, that if death or his hand was an alternative that I mu&s;t chu&s;e, I would with|out he&s;itation prefer death as the le&s;&s;er hard|&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This determined &s;peech &s;eemed to &s;urpri&s;e my aunt, though I think &s;he had no rea&s;on to expect I could ever be prevailed upon to marry &s;ir I&s;aac.</Q></P>

<Q>I confe&s;s I was greatly affected with her calm re&s;entment, &s;o likely to be la&s;ting: I bur&s;t into tears; &s;he went out of the room, I followed her into another, where Mr. Dan|vers was &s;itting. As &s;oon as I perceived him, I ha&s;tily withdrew, for I was not willing to be &s;een by him in that &s;tate of dejection&mdash; I re|tired to my own room, and there; after I had relieved my mind by another flood of tears, I endeavoured to &s;often my own apprehen&s;ions of what might be the effects of having di&s;|obliged the only relation who would own me, and collected all my fortitude to enable me to bear the wor&s;t that could happen. But that wor&s;t, my dear, proved &s;o terrible to my frighted imagination, that to avoid it, I have taken a very imprudent and dangerous &s;tep, and whither it will lead me, Heaven knows; for my heart forebodes &s;ome fatal con&s;equence from it.</Q></P>
<P>"Lord ble&s;s me!" &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,

Mrs. White tapp'd at my door, after &s;he had put my aunt to bed; I let her in, and, in a rapture of joy, I told her how favourably my aunt &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed, and that I &s;hould no longer be per&s;ecuted about the odious baronet.

I found the chaplain with her: they &s;eemed to be in deep di&s;cour&s;e; and my lady, as if angry at being interrupted, bid me, in a ha&s;ty manner, come to her another time.

<P><Q>Good God! cried I, what &s;hall I do? what &s;hall I do? repeated I pa&s;&s;ionately, in the angui&s;h of my mind.

I might well imagine &s;he would u&s;e violence to detain me, if I attempted it openly; therefore it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;teal my&s;elf away, and this has the air of an adventure you mu&s;t own; but as I had no confident in this de&s;ign, no gallant youth to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my e&s;cape, and did not even make u&s;e of a ladder of ropes, or en|danger breaking my neck, I am afraid this adventure is not in a ta&s;te high enough for you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="167">"Oh, you are rallying me!" &s;aid mi&s;s Wood|by;
<Q>but I long to know how you e&s;caped; no confident! how could you manage &s;o arduous an undertaking by your&s;elf?</Q></P>
<P>"With great ea&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>and I don't think you will allow it to be an e&s;cape, when I tell you I walked peaceably out of a door, not without &s;ome tre|pidation however, which aro&s;e le&s;s from the fear of a pur&s;uit, than the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I was taking a &s;tep which every young woman of delicacy will if po&s;&s;ible avoid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As I have already told you, I in&s;tantly re|&s;olved upon leaving my aunt; but where &s;hould I &s;eek an a&s;ylum? Mr. Bale, who&s;e protec|tion I might have reque&s;ted with honour, was not in town; my brother was abroad; none of my father's relations would receive me; I had no acquaintances but &s;uch as were my aunt's, to whom any application would have been very improper, as I &s;hould have found very &s;trong prejudices to combat with; it be|ing a received maxim among per&s;ons of a certain age, that young people are always in the wrong; be&s;ides, one &s;eldom meets with any one who has not that littlene&s;s, of &s;oul which is mi&s;taken for prudence, and teaches that it is not &s;afe to meddle with other peo|ple's
<PB N="157" REF="168">
affairs, which narrow notion prevents many a good office, many a kind interpo&s;ition; &s;o that we &s;eem to live only for our&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My perplexed mind could &s;ugge&s;t no better expedient to me, than to &s;eize the fir&s;t oppor|tunity that offered to go to London, and there conceal my&s;elf in a private lodging till Mr. Bale's return, who I doubted not would take me under his protection. Before I had fixed upon this re&s;olution, great part of the night was wa&s;ted; &s;o that I lay later than u&s;ual the next morning. When I went down to break|fa&s;t, I found my aunt dre&s;&s;ed, and her coach ordered. She took notice that my eyes looked heavy; I told her I had a violent headach, which indeed was true: &s;he &s;aid it was a cold, and bid me keep my&s;elf warm.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am going to Richmond, added &s;he, it will be late before I return to dinner; there|fore let the cook get you a chicken when you chu&s;e to dine, and don't walk out to increa&s;e your cold.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My heart leaped &s;o when I found I was to be left at home, that I was afraid my emotion was vi&s;ible in my countenance. My aunt however did not ob&s;erve it; for, apparently, &s;he had no &s;u&s;picion that I knew any thing of her de&s;ign to &s;end me to a convent: and
<PB N="158" REF="169">
therefore &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s my in|tention to leave her. But &s;he certainly over|acted her part, all on a &s;udden to drop her fa|vourite &s;cheme, the marrying me to &s;ir I&s;aac Darby; and when I might rea&s;onably expect that my ob&s;tinate refu&s;al to comply with her de&s;ires, would create &s;ome coldne&s;s in her to|wards me, to find her not only free from all re&s;entment, but even particularly kind and obliging. Sure this was &s;ufficient to rai&s;e doubts in my mind, that &s;omething more than ordinary was at the bottom of all this af|fability.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It often happens that cunning over-reaches it&s;elf; for it &s;eldom hits a medium, and gene|rally does too much or too little. My aunt's behaviour would have led me to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome de&s;ign was forming again&s;t me; but if it had not been for Mrs. White's information, I &s;hould never have been able to di&s;cover what it was, for my own penetration would have gone no further than to &s;ugge&s;t, that &s;ome &s;cheme was laid to bring about my marriage with &s;ir I&s;aac Darby; but this fear would have been &s;ufficient to have winged my flight, &s;o that the arts my aunt made u&s;e of to lull me into &s;ecurity, proved the very foundation of my doubts.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="170">
<Q>I had a new palpitation of the heart when I &s;aw the chaplain follow my aunt into the coach. Sure! thought I, Heaven approves of my de&s;ign to get away, &s;ince &s;o many cir|cum&s;tances concur to make it practicable. It was natural, my dear, as my religion was in danger from the per&s;ecutions preparing for me, to think Heaven intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of my intended e&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is certainly &s;omething very plea&s;ing in &s;uppo&s;ing one's &s;elf the peculiar care of Providence on certain occa&s;ions. A Roman catholick would have made little le&s;s than a miracle of &s;o favourable a concurrence of cir|cum&s;tances. However I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this ri&s;ing &s;ally of &s;piritual vanity, and employed my thoughts in contriving how to get to town with convenience and &s;afety, without expecting any &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P>Here mi&s;s Woodby broke in upon the fair nar|rater, with an exclamation that will be found in the following chapter.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>"OH! my dear," interrupted mi&s;s Wood|by, laughing,
<Q>you have given an ex|cellent name to a &s;pecies of folly, which at once excites one's laughter and indignation. I know an old lady who is a con&s;tant fre|quenter of the chapel in Oxford-road, that has arrived to &s;uch a heighth of &s;piritual va|nity as you ju&s;tly term it, that &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies Providence is perpetually exerting it&s;elf in mi|racles for her pre&s;ervation, and that her mo&s;t incon&s;iderable actions are under the imme|diate direction of Heaven; for &s;he will tell you with &s;urpri&s;ing meekne&s;s and humility, that unworthy as &s;he is, &s;he is in high favour with God; if &s;he happens to &s;tumble again&s;t a &s;tone without falling, &s;he &s;ays, with a &s;mile of con&s;cious &s;atisfaction, To be &s;ure God is very good to <HI>me.</HI> According to her, <HI>God acts by partial, not by general laws.</HI> And &s;hould it cea&s;e raining immediately before &s;he is to go out, either to church or a vi&s;it, it is all one, &s;he &s;uppo&s;es that Providence is at that
<PB N="161" REF="172">
moment at work for her, and has cleared the &s;kies that &s;he may walk with conveniency; for &s;he cannot always purcha&s;e a coach or a chair, half of her little income being appro|priated to the preachers, from who&s;e doctrine &s;he has imbibed the&s;e &s;elf-flattering ideas.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh!" &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, laughing,
<Q>you have heightened the colouring of this picture exceedingly.</Q></P>
<P>"Upon my word I have not," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>and&mdash; but that I am not willing to interrupt your &s;tory &s;o long, I could give you an hundred proofs of this odd &s;pecies of pride; for I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, the haughtie&s;t beauty in the drawing-room, amid&s;t a croud of adorers and in the fulle&s;t di&s;play of airs and graces, has not half the vanity of one of the&s;e &s;aints of Whitefield's or We&s;ley's creation.</Q></P>
<P>"I really pity the poor woman you men|tioned,"
&s;aid Henrietta;
<Q>&s;he appears to me to be very far from attaining to any degree of perfection: for may it not be &s;uppo&s;ed that this unrea&s;onable confidence will lead her to neglect many duties very e&s;|&s;ential to a good chri&s;tian? For I have heard it ob&s;erved, that the preachers of that &s;ect chiefly declaim again&s;t fa&s;hionable &s;ollies; and, according to them, to dre&s;s with ele|gance
<PB N="162" REF="173">
to go to a play or an opera, or to make one at a party of cards, are mortal &s;ins; mean time poor morals are wholly neglected, and &s;uper&s;tition is made an equivalent for a vir|tuous life.</Q></P>
<P>"Yet a writer," replied mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>who is greatly admired by our &s;ex, and who in his works pays court to all religious, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing him&s;elf &s;o evenly amid&s;t them, that it is hard to di&s;tingui&s;h to which he mo&s;t inclines, has introduced the&s;e modern &s;aints reclaiming a woman who had led a very vicious life, and doing more than all the be&s;t orthodox divines had done; and he has not thrown away his compliment: I dare &s;ay this numerous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has bought up an impre&s;&s;ion of his book, and is not the third edition upon the title page a very good return to it? Oh! my dear, there is no vanity like the vanity of &s;ome authors: it is not to be doubted but if there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> men enough in the kingdom to add a unit more to the account of tho&s;e editions, but we &s;hould find him introducing the alcoran, mak|ing pro&s;elytes from luxury.&mdash; But how have we wandered from your &s;tory&mdash; You are &s;till at Wind&s;or &mdash; I long to hear the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="174">"I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear," &s;aid mi&s;s Cour|tency, &s;ighing,
<Q>I have not been &s;orry for this little interruption; it has given &s;ome relief to my mind; for I know not how it is, but the recollection of this period is painful to me; and yet under the &s;ame terrors, and with the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions, I &s;hould certainly act again as I have done. I think I told you that Mr. Danvers went in the coach with my aunt; a circum&s;tance with which I had rea&s;on to be rejoiced, as it greatly facilitated my e&s;cape. I was &s;till lingering over the tea-table, uncer|tain in what manner I &s;hould perform my little journey, when Mrs. White came into the room: &s;he was apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould be unea&s;y at my aunt's and the chaplain's excur|&s;ion together, as &s;uppo&s;ing it was to &s;ettle &s;omething relating to their &s;cheme; and there|fore made ha&s;te to inform me, that my aunt had been &s;ummoned to Richmond, by a me&s;|&s;age from a Roman catholick friend of her's, who was dangerou&s;ly ill there, and de&s;ired to &s;ee her, together with Mr. Danvers, who was her gho&s;tly father, as they term it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mrs. White continued to talk to me on the &s;ubject of my aunt's de&s;ign, while I was con|&s;idering whether it would be proper to make her the confident of my intended flight to Lon|don,
<PB N="164" REF="175">
and engage her to procure me &s;ome ve|hicle to carry me thither. But it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might not approve of my leaving my aunt &s;o &s;uddenly, in which ca&s;e I &s;hould find it dif|ficult to get away: be&s;ides, I did not think it rea&s;onable to involve her in the con&s;equences of my flight, by making her privy to it; and that the only way to enable her to ju&s;tify her|&s;elf to my aunt was not to make her guilty. I therefore re&s;olved to &s;teal out of the hou&s;e, and go as far as I could on foot, not doubt|ing but chance would throw &s;ome carriage in my way, in which I might fini&s;h my journey; and, to gain all the time I could, I told Mrs. White, that my anxiety had hindered me from &s;leeping all night; that I was not well, and would go to my chamber and try to get &s;ome repo&s;e, de&s;iring her not to di&s;turb me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Having thus got four hours at lea&s;t before me, I re&s;olved to write a &s;hort letter to my aunt before I went. In this letter I told her, that having accidentally di&s;covered her inten|tion of &s;ending me to a convent abroad, my terrors of &s;uch a confinement had forced me to throw my&s;elf under the protection of Mr. Bale; that I hoped, through his mediation, to convince her I had been guilty of no impru|dences which could merit &s;uch &s;evere treat|ment
<PB N="165" REF="176">
as a puni&s;hment, and was not &s;o un|&s;ettled in my religion as to be perverted by that or any other means. I begged her to believe, that except in that article, and in marrying contrary to my inclinations, I would pay her the &s;ame obedience as to a parent; but that I would rather &s;ubmit to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of po|verty, than marry a man whom I could nei|ther love or e&s;teem; or change the religion in which I was bred, and with which I was en|tirely &s;atisfied. I concluded with earne&s;tly intreating to be re&s;tored to her good opinion, which I a&s;&s;ured her I would always endeavour to de&s;erve.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Having &s;caled and directed this letter, I put it into one of my dre&s;&s;ing-boxes, not doubt|ing but as &s;oon as I was mi&s;&s;ing, every thing that belonged to me would be &s;earched for letters, in hopes of further di&s;coveries. I next tied up &s;ome linen in a handkerchief, and with an aking heart, &s;allied out of my cham|ber, and cro&s;&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age-room which had &s;teps leading to the garden. As &s;oon as I had got out of the back-door, which opened into the fore&s;t, I concluded my&s;elf &s;afe from di&s;co|very, and mended my pace; having no dif|ficulty in finding my way, becau&s;e I pur&s;ued
<PB N="166" REF="177">
the road which I had often traver&s;ed in a coach or a chai&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You will ea&s;ily imagine my mind was full of melancholy reflections, and indeed &s;o en|tirely was I engro&s;&s;ed by them for near an hour, that I did not perceive I was tired, till I grew &s;o faint I was hardly able to move a &s;tep far|ther. I had now got into the open road, and it being about the time when I might expect to &s;ee &s;ome of the &s;tage-coaches from Wind|&s;or pa&s;s that way, I &s;at down under the &s;hade of a large tree, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the road, impatiently wi&s;hing for the &s;ight. All this time I had not been alarmed with the fear of meeting with any in&s;ult, for I had &s;een no one from whom I could apprehend any &s;uch thing; but I had &s;carce enjoyed this com|fortable &s;helter three minutes, when I per|ceived two ill looking fellows, as I thought them, making towards me with all the &s;peed they were able. I &s;tarted up in inconceivable terror, looking round me to &s;ee if any help was near if they &s;hould a&s;&s;ault me, when I fortunately di&s;covered the &s;tage-coach; and being now ea&s;ed of my fears, I re&s;umed my &s;tation, till it was come near enough for me to &s;peak to the driver. The two fellows who had given me &s;uch a terrible alarm, &s;topped
<PB N="167" REF="178">
&s;hort upon &s;eeing the coach, and I really be|lieve I had an e&s;cape from them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I called out to the coachman as &s;oon as he could hear me. You know, my dear, the difficulties I found in getting admi&s;&s;ion. Little did tho&s;e good women, who refu&s;ed it, ima|gine that to avoid a &s;light inconvenience to them&s;elves, they were con&s;igning me over to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s imaginable.</Q></P>
<P>"Wretches!" exclaimed mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>I cannot think of them without dete&s;tation; but, my dear (pur&s;ued &s;he) did not you won|der to &s;ee a per&s;on of any figure in a &s;tage-coach? As for you, I &s;oon di&s;covered there was &s;omething extraordinary in your ca&s;e: but what did you think of me with &s;uch com|pany, and in &s;uch an equipage?</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed, my dear," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>at that time a &s;tage-coach appeared to me a mo&s;t de&s;irable vehicle, and I had not then the lea&s;t notion of its being a mean one; &s;o greatly do our opinions of things alter with our cir|cum&s;tances and &s;ituations: be&s;ides, a difficulty then occurred to my thoughts, which, amid&s;t the hurry and precipitation with which I quitted my aunt's hou&s;e, had not been &s;ufficiently at|tended to before, and that was how I &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf for a few days, till Mr. Bale's

return; for it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould conceal my&s;elf with great care, having &s;o much to ap|prehend from my aunt's bigotry and preju|dices, and the (perhaps) intere&s;ted officiou&s;ne&s;s of her chaplain.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Under what &s;trange di&s;advantages had I lodgings to &s;eek for! by an a&s;&s;umed name, with an immediate occa&s;ion for them; and no recommendation to any particular hou&s;e, which I could be &s;ure was a reputable one. Your politene&s;s, and the unexpected offer of your friend&s;hip, encouraged me to commu|nicate my di&s;tre&s;s to you, and to intreat your a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and I mu&s;t &s;till regret the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lucky mi&s;take that brought me hither in&s;tead of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. Egret's. And now, my dear, you have my whole &s;tory before you. Have I not been very unfortunate? and am I not in a men dreadful &s;ituation?

<P>"Approve your flight!" cried mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>Yes certainly, child: who would not fly from a bigot, a prie&s;t, and an old hideous

<Q>Well, that is &s;ome comfort,</Q>
replied mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>but every body will not think as you do; and to a mind of any delicacy, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nothing is &s;o &s;hocking as to have a reputation to defend; and the &s;tep I have taken will no doubt expo&s;e me to many unfavourable cen&s;ures.</Q></P>
<P>"And do you imagine," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>that with a form &s;o plea&s;ing, and an under|&s;tanding &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, you will be exempted from the tax that envy is &s;ure to levy upon merit? Don't you know what the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible of all poets &s;ays:

Take my word for it, it is no great compli|ment we pay to per&s;ons, when we tell them that all the world &s;peaks well of them; for tho&s;e who are remarkable for any &s;hining qua|lities will be more envied than admired, and frequently more calumniated than prai&s;ed. But, child,</Q>
pur&s;ued the volatile mi&s;s Wood|by, a&s;&s;uming a &s;prightly air,
<Q>how do you in|tend to di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf to-day; it is late: I mu&s;t go home to dre&s;s.</Q></P>

<P>MISS Courteney, after having traver&s;ed her chamber &s;everal times in great re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of mind, at length re&s;olved to take a hackney coach and drive to Mr. Bale's, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he &s;hould know from his clerks or &s;ervants the exact time when he was expected home; at lea&s;t they could give her a direction where to write to him, and it would be &s;ome comfort to acquaint him with her &s;ituation, and have his advice.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="182">She had no &s;ooner formed this de&s;ign than &s;he ha&s;tened to put it in execution; and having made a &s;light alteration in her dre&s;s, &s;he went down to Mrs. Eccles, and de&s;ired her to &s;end her maid for a coach, telling her &s;he was obliged to go into the city upon bu&s;ine&s;s, and de&s;ired her not to wait for her at dinner. Mrs. Eccles in&s;i&s;ted upon waiting till four o'clock at lea&s;t, and at|tended her to the door, le&s;s out of complai&s;ance than to hear where &s;he ordered the coachman to drive; for the enquietude, irre&s;olution, and pen&s;ivene&s;s, which &s;he di&s;covered in her fair lodger, extremely heightened her curio&s;ity to know her affairs.</P>
<P>Henrietta, though &s;he did not &s;u&s;pect the motive of her officiou&s;ne&s;s, yet not thinking it proper to let her know where &s;he was going, only bid the coachman drive to St. Paul's church|yard, and when there, &s;he gave him a fuller di|rection. Alas! &s;ighed &s;he, when the coach &s;topped before the great gates of her guardian's hou&s;e, were the ho&s;pitable ma&s;ter of this man|&s;ion at home, here &s;hould I find a &s;ecure a&s;y|lum.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a &s;ervant appeared, &s;he a&s;ked if Mr. Bale was at home, that &s;he might with greater propriety introduce her farther enquiries; but was mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him an|&s;wer

her in the affirmative, while he opened the coach-door: however, &s;he ordered the coach|man to wait, and then followed the &s;ervant, who introduced her into a large parlour, and retired to acquaint his ma&s;ter with her being there.</P>
<P>Immediately a young gentleman, of an en|gaging appearance, entered the room, and de|&s;ired to know her commands.

added he; his voice becoming in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ofter while he gazed on a form which it was not po&s;&s;ible to be|hold without &s;ome &s;en&s;ibility.
<Q>Pray let me know, it will give me great plea&s;ure if I can be in the lea&s;t degree u&s;eful to you.</Q></P>

<P>"Pardon me, madam," &s;aid young Mr. Bale, "is not your name Courteney." "It is &s;ir," replied &s;he.</P>

added he, after a pau&s;e and &s;ighing,

<P>"Yes, madam," &s;aid Mr. Bale,
<Q>I know &s;omething of your affairs, and from my &s;oul I approve of your courage and re&s;olution. A gentleman, named Danvers, was here ye&s;ter|day to enquire for you; your aunt's chaplain, is he not?</Q></P>
<P>"Yes, &s;ir," replied mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>and my per&s;ecutor&mdash; but what did he &s;ay? I

&s;uppo&s;e he repre&s;ented me in &s;trange co|lours.</Q></P>

<P>"Ah! the wretch," interrupted mi&s;s Cour|teney, not able to contain her indignation;
<Q>I &s;ee he has been propagating fal&s;hoods inju|rious to my reputation; after having poi&s;oned the mind of my aunt with &s;u&s;picions that were the cau&s;e of my lo&s;ing her affection, he is en|deavouring to deprive me of every friend I have in the world&mdash; But this, &s;ir, is the plain truth: he &s;ugge&s;ted, as I have no rea&s;on to doubt, a prepo&s;terous match for me to my aunt; I rejected it; he found means to per|&s;uade my aunt, that I li&s;tened privately to the addre&s;&s;es of &s;ome man who was an improper match for me. My aunt, in order to prevent my ruin, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, in&s;i&s;ted upon my ac|cepting the hu&s;band &s;he had cho&s;en for me; and, upon my ob&s;tinate refu&s;al, was prevailed upon by her chaplain to re&s;olve to confine me in a nunnery abroad. I had intelligence of this de&s;ign, and I &s;ecretly left my aunt's hou&s;e, to prevent her executing it; but I
<PB N="175" REF="186">
am &s;o far from having any &s;ecret engage|ment, that if I could be &s;ure my aunt would not pur&s;ue her &s;cheme of entrapping me in a convent, I would in&s;tantly return and bind my&s;elf by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths never to marry any one whom &s;he does not approve.</Q></P>
<P>"You &s;ee, &s;ir," proceeded mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>what need I have of your father's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he is my only friend and protector; through his mediation I might expect to be re&s;tored to the good opinion of my aunt.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, madam," &s;aid Mr. Bale,
<Q>if you will write to him, I will take care of your letter; and if it be ready to-morrow, I will attend you my&s;elf for it; I hope you have no objection to my knowing where you are: in my father's ab&s;ence I &s;hall be proud to act as your guardian; though he has had the hap|pine&s;s of knowing you longer, yet his con|cern for your intere&s;t cannot be greater than mine. Shall I wait on you to-morrow morn|ing, mi&s;s?</Q>
added he. Henrietta, by his manner of urging this reque&s;t, and his fre|quently ca&s;ting his eye towards the door, as if afraid of &s;ome interruption, concluding that &s;he detained him from bu&s;ine&s;s of more im|portance, ro&s;e up immediately, and, giving him a direction to her lodgings by the name

of Ben&s;on, told him, &s;he would have her letter ready; but a&s;ked if it would not come &s;afe in|clo&s;ed to him by the penny-po&s;t, being unwil|ling, &s;he &s;aid, to give him the trouble of coming for it.</P>
<P>"I beg, madam," &s;aid he, as he took her hand to lead her to the coach,
<Q>that you will believe I can have no greater plea&s;ure than that of &s;erving you. It is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould have an opportunity of talking to you at lei&s;ure, that I may know how I can be far|ther u&s;eful to you.</Q></P>
<P>Having helped her into the coach, be bowed low, and retired ha&s;tily, with &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of tender concern on his countenance as any woman, le&s;s free from vanity than mi&s;s Courte|ney, would not have failed to ob&s;erve; but &s;he making no other reflections on his behaviour, than that he was more polite than per&s;ons u&s;ually are who are bred up to bu&s;ine&s;s, congratulated her&s;elf on having &s;ound a friend, through whom &s;he could &s;ecurely corre&s;pond with her guardian, and receive his advice, &s;o that &s;he might now con&s;ider her&s;elf as being under his immediate care and direction, though ab&s;ent; a circum|&s;tance that greatly alleviated her unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Eccles, who had waited dinner for her longer than had been agreed on, expre&s;&s;ed great
<PB N="177" REF="188">
plea&s;ure at &s;eeing her look &s;o chearful.
<Q>To be &s;ure (&s;aid &s;he) you have heard &s;ome unex|pected good news, I am heartily glad of it&mdash; Well, now I hope you will have more &s;pirits.</Q>
Henrietta &s;miled, but made no an&s;wer; for an ingenuous mind can only evade indi&s;creet curio|&s;ity by &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The cloth was &s;carce removed, when the young lord, who had now taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his apartment in Mrs. Eccles's hou&s;e, came into the parlour. Henrietta immediately ro&s;e up to re|tire to her own chamber, when he &s;tarting back, and &s;tanding at the door as if to ob&s;truct her pa&s;&s;age,
<Q>I came (&s;aid he) Mrs. Eccles, to beg you would make me a di&s;h of coffee; but &s;ince my pre&s;ence drives this young lady away, I will go up &s;tairs again.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh, by no means, my lord," &s;aid Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>I am &s;ure mi&s;s Ben&s;on will not let you think &s;o. You are not going, mi&s;s, are you?</Q>
added &s;he, turning to Henrietta.</P>
<P>"I have letters to write," &s;aid the young lady, "that will take me up the whole afternoon."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid my lord,
<Q>I will drink no coffee then; for unle&s;s you &s;tay, mi&s;s, I &s;hall be per&s;uaded that my coming has driven you away. Let me intreat you,</Q>
pur&s;ued he, entering and leading her to a chair,
<Q>to allow
<PB N="178" REF="189">
me the plea&s;ure of drinking a di&s;h of coffee with you; you will have time enough after|wards to write your letters.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney, who was willing to avoid the appearance of &s;ingularity, &s;at down again, tho' with &s;ome reluctance, telling his lord&s;hip that &s;he would not be the means of di&s;appointing him of his coffee; but that &s;he mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon be|ing permitted to withdraw in half an hour, hav|ing bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence upon her hands.</P>
<P>The young nobleman gave little attention to what &s;he &s;aid, but gazed on her with an ear|ne&s;tne&s;s that threw her into &s;ome confu&s;ion. The milliner going out of the room to give or|ders about the coffee, he began in mo&s;t vehe|ment language to declare a pa&s;&s;ion for her, and called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of poetry, to expre&s;s his admiration of her charms.</P>
<P>Henrietta, who in her own character would have treated this manner of addre&s;s with ridicule and contempt, thought it became her, in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, to re&s;ent it &s;eriou&s;ly; therefore ri&s;ing, with &s;ome &s;igns of indignation, &s;he told him, that &s;ince his lord&s;hip thought proper to entertain her with &s;uch kind of di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;he would immediately retire. My lord, who &s;aw &s;he was angry in good earne&s;t, was exce&s;&s;ively afraid of her leaving him; there|fore
<PB N="179" REF="190">
taking her hand, which he forcibly held, till he had &s;ealed a vow upon it with his lips, that he would not &s;ay another word to offend her, he brought her back to her &s;eat, which, upon &s;ee|ing Mrs. Eccles enter, &s;he re&s;umed.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then took another turn; but Henrietta was too much chagrined to mix in it with any degree of chearfulne&s;s: be&s;ides, the party &s;eemed to her to be but ill a&s;&s;orted, a no|bleman, a milliner, and a young woman in ob|&s;cure circum&s;tances. Her delicacy was &s;hocked, and all the politene&s;s &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of was &s;carce &s;ufficient to hinder her from &s;hewing how much &s;he was di&s;plea&s;ed with her&s;elf and her company.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the tea-equipage was removed, &s;he looked at her watch; and &s;eeming apprehen&s;ive that &s;he &s;hould not have time enough to write her letters, &s;he withdrew with &s;uch precipitation, that they had no opportunity to &s;olicit her longer &s;tay.</P>
<P>"This is a &s;trange girl," &s;aid the young lord, throwing him&s;elf into his chair, from whence he had ri&s;en to return the ha&s;ty compliment &s;he made at her departure,
<Q>but divinely hand&s;ome; who can &s;he be? I vow to Gad I believe I &s;hall be in love with her in earne&s;t: have you made no di&s;covery yet, Mrs. Eccles,</Q>

he;
<Q>there is certainly &s;ome my&s;tery in the ca&s;e, and a love-my&s;tery it mu&s;t be; for women are not even faithful to their own &s;e|crets, unle&s;s an amour is the bu&s;ine&s;s, and then they are impenetrable.</Q></P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip may be &s;ure," &s;aid Mrs. Ec|cles,
<Q>that I have &s;pared no pains to di&s;cover who &s;he is; but &s;he is exce&s;&s;ively re&s;erved, and talks &s;o little, that there is no probability of intrapping her: yet, I think there is one way, by which your curio&s;ity may be &s;atisfied. Your lord&s;hip has &s;een a gay &s;lighty lady with her, of whom &s;he is very fond.</Q></P>
<P>"What, that ugly creature!" &s;aid my lord,
<Q>that fa&s;tened upon me in your &s;hop; do you mean her? is mi&s;s Ben&s;on fond of that thing?</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! very fond," replied Mrs. Eccles.
<Q>They were &s;hut up together four hours thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very morning.</Q></P>
<P>"Then depend upon it &s;he is the confident," &s;aid his lord&s;hip.
<Q>Oh! I gue&s;s your &s;cheme, you would have me bribe her.</Q></P>
<P>"Bribe her, my lord," repeated Mrs. Ec|cles;
<Q>&s;he &s;eems to be a woman of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me fa&s;hion. I dare &s;ay you would affront her extremely, by offering her a bribe.</Q></P>
<P>"I am very &s;ure," interrupted his lord&s;hip,
<Q>that &s;he will not be able to re&s;i&s;t the bribe I &s;hall
<PB N="181" REF="192">
offer her: I will flatter her, my dear Mrs. Ec|cles, till I not only become ma&s;ter of all her friend's &s;ecrets, but even her own; but how &s;hall I get an opportunity of talking to her alone?</Q></P>
<P>"I will engage," &s;aid Mrs. Eccles,
<Q>that it will not be long before &s;he is here again; and, if your lord&s;hip &s;hould happen to be below when &s;he comes, I fancy you would not find it difficult to detain her a little while from her friend.</Q></P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid my lord,
<Q>I leave it to you to manage this interview for me: when I know who this mi&s;s Ben&s;on is, I can make my ap|proaches accordingly; but when do you ex|pect her down &s;tairs again?</Q>
<Q>Not till &s;up|per-time,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Eccles;
<Q>&s;he is never weary of being alone.</Q>
<Q>Ah, that is a bad &s;ign!</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q>I doubt I have a rival&mdash;Well I will look in upon you at ten o'clock; per|haps I may find her with you.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Eccles a&s;&s;uring him &s;he would engage her till that time, if po&s;&s;ible. He went away hum|ming an opera-air, but with le&s;s vacuity of thought than u&s;ual, mi&s;s Ben&s;on being &s;o much in his head, that, if he had been accu&s;tomed to reflexion, he would have concluded &s;he was in his heart al&s;o, and that he was in love with her in earne&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="193">Henrietta in the mean time was employed in writing her letter to Mr. Bale, to whom &s;he gave a faithful account of all that had happened to her, and earne&s;tly intreated his good offices towards effecting a reconciliation between her aunt and her. The inconveniencies &s;he &s;aw her|&s;elf expo&s;ed to in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation made her &s;o de&s;irous of this happy event, that her letter was almo&s;t a continued repetition of &s;olicitations for that purpo&s;e. She begged him, in ca&s;e he did not return to England, to write to her aunt, and endeavour to &s;often her, a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he pretended to no greater liberty than what an obedient daughter might expect from a parent; being re&s;olved to obey her will in every thing, provided &s;he might not be compelled to marry the old baronet, nor confined in a nunnery with a view to the change of her religion.</P>
<P>She expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction in the polite behaviour of his &s;on to her, whom &s;he would con&s;ider, &s;he &s;aid, as her guardian in his ab&s;ence, and would take no &s;tep without his advice and concurrence.</P>
<P>She had fini&s;hed her letter long before the milliner's u&s;ual hour of &s;upper; but being re|&s;olved to go down no more that evening, &s;he &s;pread letters and papers upon the table, as if &s;he &s;till continued extremely bu&s;y. Mrs. Eccles,

<P>Mrs. Eccles did not think proper to pre&s;s her; for her extreme re&s;erve in&s;pired her with a kind of awe, that made her cautious of giving her the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t; and Henrietta taking leave of her at her chamber-door for the night, &s;he went away in great concern for the di&s;appointment his lord&s;hip would meet with.</P>
<P>It was indeed a very mortifying di&s;appointment to him; for his impatience to &s;ee mi&s;s Courteney had brought him back much &s;ooner than he had intended, and Mrs. Eccles, when &s;he came down &s;tairs, found him already in her parlour. When he heard the young lady's re&s;olution, not to appear again that night, he took an uncere|monious leave of his complai&s;ant landlady, and joined his company again at White's, wonder|ing to find him&s;elf in &s;o ill an humour, on &s;o &s;light an occa&s;ion, and that dice and Burgundy were &s;carce &s;ufficient to call off his thoughts from this coy unknown, whom yet he did not de&s;pair of gaining.</P>

<P>HEnrietta, upon her coming down next morning to breakfa&s;t, was informed by Mrs. Eccles, that a gentleman had been en|quiring for her that morning; but, hearing &s;he was not up, had left word that he would call again. She did not doubt but it was Mr. Bale, and was a little confu&s;ed that his punctuality &s;hould &s;o much exceed her's in an affair that immediately concerned her; but the truth was, the young merchant's impatience to &s;ee her had out&s;tripped time, and he came much ear|lier than &s;he had rea&s;on to expect him.</P>
<P>She retired immediately after breakfa&s;t, de|&s;iring that the gentleman might be &s;hown up &s;tairs when he came again; for Mrs. Eccles, at her reque&s;t, had made a &s;mall alteration in her apartment, and put her bed in an adjoining clo&s;et, that &s;he might with more propriety re|ceive a vi&s;it in her own room.</P>
<P>She was &s;carce got up &s;tairs, when Mr. Bale was introduced: &s;he apologi&s;ed for the trouble he had in calling twice; and delivering him he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

letter, recommended it to his care with extreme earne&s;tne&s;s, a&s;&s;uring him, &s;he &s;hould be very unhappy till &s;he had an an&s;wer. She then en|quired more particularly concerning the vi&s;it Mr. Danvers had made him, anxious to collect from what he &s;aid what impre&s;&s;ion her flight had made upon her aunt.</P>
<P>"I will not flatter you, mi&s;s," &s;aid Mr. Bale.
<Q>Lady Meadows is extremely enraged&mdash; Mr. Danvers mentioned nothing of a de&s;ign to put you into a convent; but owned that your aunt had a very advantageous match in view for you, which you rejected&mdash;and&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"Pray go on, &s;ir," &s;aid Henrietta, ob&s;erving that he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"Your aunt will have it," madam, pur&s;ued he,
<Q>that your affections are engaged&mdash;I can|not believe that a young lady of your good &s;en&s;e would make an improper choice&mdash; I &s;hould be very glad to be able to convince my father that nothing of this kind is the ca&s;e&mdash; Excu&s;e me, mi&s;s, I am very anxious for your happine&s;s; it would give me infinite joy to find that your aunt is mi&s;taken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My aunt has no rea&s;on, &s;ir, for her &s;u&s;pi|cions,</Q>
replied Henrietta;
<Q>but if my affec|tions were engaged, why &s;hould &s;he think I

"Ah! mi&s;s&mdash;" eagerly interrupted Mr. Bale.</P>
<P>"I hope, &s;ir," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, gravely&punc;
<Q>you will believe me, when I declare that my aunt's fears are without foundation: it con|cerns me greatly that your father &s;hould not entertain the &s;ame idle &s;u&s;picions; and, were he here, I am &s;ure I could convince him.</Q></P>
<P>"Dear mi&s;s," interrupted Mr. Bale,
<Q>I can|not &s;uffer you to go on; do not imagine that I am not convinced. I had doubts, but you will excu&s;e them; my great concern for your happine&s;s was the cau&s;e&mdash;Rely upon me, I beg you; I will take care my father &s;hall not be prejudiced, and till his return I am your guardian.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, upon a little reflection, was more plea&s;ed than offended at the doubts he &s;o can|didly acknowledged; in &s;o young a man, &s;uch plainne&s;s and &s;incerity were far more agreeable than the refinements of compliment and flat|tery, and more &s;uitable to the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r in which he de&s;ired to be con&s;idered, and in which &s;he did con&s;ider him. She thanked him fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;olicitude, which &s;he &s;aid was &s;o advantageous to her; and to &s;hew him that &s;he wi&s;hed to give him all imaginable &s;atisfaction with regard to
<PB N="187" REF="198">
her conduct, &s;he entered into a particular detail of the &s;ituation &s;he had been in with her aunt, who&s;e views with regard to her, &s;he explained: &s;he &s;lightly touched upon the character of the chaplain, and imputed to his great influence over her aunt, the ra&s;h and &s;evere re&s;olutions &s;he had taken again&s;t her.</P>
<P>She was proceeding to ju&s;tify her&s;elf for hav|ing left her aunt's hou&s;e; when Mr. Bale in|terrupted her with &s;ome emotion:
<Q>every rea|&s;onable per&s;on, mi&s;s (&s;aid he) that knows your motives for taking this &s;tep, will not only hold you excu&s;ed, but will even ap|plaud you for not &s;acrificing your&s;elf to riches.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;ure," &s;aid Henrietta,
<Q>my aunt would hear rea&s;on, were it not for that invi|dious chaplain, who fills her with &s;u&s;picions, and animates her re&s;entment. Oh, that Mr. Bale was come!</Q></P>
<P>"I hope," &s;aid the young merchant,
<Q>that we &s;hall &s;ee him &s;hortly; but in the mean time, mi&s;s, let me know how I can be u&s;eful to you: do you like your pre&s;ent lodgings? are the people &s;uch as you approve? Let me know if you have any inclination to remove, and I will endeavour to &s;ettle you &s;ome-where that will be agreeable to my father; I &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="188" REF="199">
you would have no objection to lodging with an acquaintance of his, and where you will be near him.</Q></P>
<P>"No, certainly," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>it would be highly agreeable to me.</Q>
<Q>Well, mi&s;s,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Bale, ri&s;ing,
<Q>I will wait on you again in a day or two: but perhaps you have occa&s;ion for money, I have brought &s;ome with me; pray do not put your&s;elf to any inconveniency, but draw for what &s;ums you have occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>"The trifle, &s;ir," &s;aid Henrietta, blu&s;hing,
<Q>that is in your father's hands, will not admit of my drawing very largely; however, I will venture to take up twenty pounds, becau&s;e I have occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e &s;ome trifling things; for all my cloaths are at my aunt's, and I am in great hopes &s;he will not &s;end them after me: that would look indeed,</Q>

<P>Mr. Bale, upon hearing this, pre&s;&s;ed her to take forty guineas; but &s;he &s;aid, twenty would do, having &s;ome money by her. He then took leave of her, with a promi&s;e to &s;ee her again &s;oon; and left her greatly plea&s;ed with his friend|ly

<P>"The lady you are going to vi&s;it," &s;aid he,
<Q>is engaged with company, I believe; but I am re&s;olved you &s;hall not go away,</Q>
pur&s;ued he, taking her hand and leading her into the parlour,
<Q>I was &s;o charmed with your conver|&s;ation the fir&s;t time I &s;aw you, that it is not probable I will lo&s;e this opportunity of renew|ing our acquaintance.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! your lord&s;hip is very obliging," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby, &s;uffering her&s;elf to be led into the parlour, while her tran&s;port at finding her|&s;elf
<PB N="191" REF="202">
treated with &s;o much gallantry, and her pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, threw her into &s;uch ridiculous affectation, that every limb and feature was di&s;torted. Compliment, to which &s;he was very little u&s;ed, acted like &s;trong li|quors upon a weak head, &s;he became &s;o intoxi|cated that &s;he hardly knew what &s;he did, which, joined to a natural aukwardne&s;s, pro|duced the mo&s;t ab&s;urd blunders in her beha|viour; &s;o that, endeavouring to trip with a lively motion to her &s;eat, &s;he overturned a light mahogany table that was in her way, and heard the cra&s;h of the china that was on it with very little emotion: the plea&s;ure of &s;hewing her&s;elf to the greate&s;t advantage, ab&s;olutely engro&s;&s;ing her; and &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably did &s;he return his lord|&s;hip's polite bow, when he had &s;eated her in her chair, that their foreheads &s;truck again&s;t each o|ther with a force like the concu&s;&s;ion of two rocks; but this accident, no more than the former, di&s;|turbed mi&s;s Woodby's enjoyment of her pre&s;ent happine&s;s; and, wholly in&s;en&s;ible to the pain of her forehead, &s;he immediately entered into conver&s;ation with his lord&s;hip, a&s;king him, with the livelie&s;t air imaginable, if he had been at Ranelagh la&s;t night; never once making the lea&s;t reflection upon what he had told her of her friend's being engaged with company, which,
<PB N="192" REF="203">
as &s;he knew her &s;ituation, might well have rai&s;ed her curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The beau told her, he was not there;
<Q>but you and mi&s;s Ben&s;on were, I &s;uppo&s;e,</Q>
added he.</P>
<P><Q>Now your lord&s;hip mentions mi&s;s Ben|&s;on,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he (without an&s;wering his que&s;tion)
<Q>pray tell me how you like her; is &s;he not very hand&s;ome?</Q></P>
<P>"Yes," replied my lord,
<Q>&s;he is hand&s;ome; but,</Q>
added he, looking full at her,
<Q>&s;he wants a certain lady's agreeable vivacity.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! your &s;ervant, my lord," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby, making the application immediately;
<Q>but really, as your lord&s;hip ob&s;erves, &s;he wants vivacity; there is &s;omething heavy and lumpi&s;h in her.</Q></P>
<P>"Yet &s;he is genteel," &s;aid my lord.
<Q>Oh! extremely genteel,</Q>
cried mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>but does not your lord&s;hip think &s;he is rather too tall? being &s;o &s;lender as &s;he is, does not that heighth give her a certain aukwardne&s;s?&mdash; But I really think &s;he has one of the fine&s;t complexions in the world!</Q></P>
<P>"Has &s;he not rather too much bloom," &s;aid my lord. "Why, yes," replied mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>I think her complexion wants delicacy; but
<PB N="193" REF="204">
no objection can be made to her eyes, you mu&s;t own, except that they are rather too large, and roll about heavily.</Q></P>
<P>"Upon the whole," &s;aid my lord,
<Q>mi&s;s Ben&s;on is tolerable; but I perceive you are extremely fond of her by your partiality.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh, my lord," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>we are the greate&s;t friends in the world; I con|ceived a violent friend&s;hip for her the fir&s;t mo|ment I &s;aw her&mdash; You cannot imagine how ardent my friend&s;hips are.</Q></P>
<P>"That is bad news for your lover," &s;aid my lord;
<Q>for, love and friend&s;hip (the wi&s;e &s;ay) exclude each other; but I hope mi&s;s Ben|&s;on makes a proper return to &s;o much affec|tion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! we are united in the &s;tronge&s;t bands of friend&s;hip,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>the dear creature has not a thought that &s;he conceals from me: and though I have not been ac|quainted with her a week, &s;he has intru&s;ted me with all her affairs.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid my lord,
<Q>not acquainted a week, and &s;o communicative: are you &s;ure, my dear mi&s;s Woodby, that this young lady is not a little &s;illy.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="205">"I cannot &s;ay," replied mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>that her under&s;tanding is the be&s;t in the world; but &s;he has a very good heart.</Q></P>
<P>"Your own is very good, I do not doubt," &s;aid my lord,
<Q>which leads you to make &s;o fa|vourable a judgment of another's&mdash;However, as &s;he has laid open her affairs to you, you may, from the conduct &s;he has avowed, col|lect your opinion of her.</Q></P>
<P>"Very true," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>and I do a&s;&s;ure your lord&s;hip, that I cannot help ap|proving of her conduct, becau&s;e her motives were certainly ju&s;t: though the ill-judging world may perhaps condemn her for running away from her aunt; and, from her hiding her&s;elf in a lodging, a&s;&s;uming another name, and &s;uch little circum&s;tances, may take occa|&s;ion to cen&s;ure her, yet I am per&s;uaded in my own mind that &s;he is blamele&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>"Ben&s;on is not her name then," &s;aid my lord, affecting great indifference.
<Q>Oh, no my lord,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>her name i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Courteney.&mdash; But ble&s;s me&mdash; what have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> done!

<P><PB N="195" REF="206">"Depend upon it, madam;" &s;aid my lord,
<Q>I will be &s;ecret as the grave. It is of no con|&s;equence to me to know her name; I &s;hall never think of it again&mdash; But to be &s;ure the poor girl is to be pitied&mdash; And &s;o &s;he ran away from her aunt; who is her aunt, pray?</Q></P>
<P>"Her aunt's name is Meadows," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>lady Meadows; do you know her?</Q></P>
<P>"Not I," &s;aid my lord, throwing him&s;elf into a carele&s;s po&s;ture, and humming an air as if his attention was wholly di&s;engaged; when &s;uddenly turning again to mi&s;s Woodby with a &s;mile&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Why (&s;aid he) &s;hould not you and I be as good friends as mi&s;s Ben&s;on and you are; our acquaintance is not of a much &s;horter date, and perhaps commenced nearly in the &s;ame manner?</Q></P>
<P>"I prote&s;t," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>and &s;o it did; for I fir&s;t &s;aw your lord&s;hip in Mrs. Ec|cles's &s;hop, and I happened to meet mi&s;s Ben&s;on in a &s;tage-coach about four days ago.</Q></P>
<P>"And there your acquaintance began?" &s;aid my lord;
<Q>you have improved it well &s;ince, if &s;he has really been ingenuous enough to let
<PB N="196" REF="207">
you into the true &s;tate of her affairs. I &s;up|po&s;e there is a lover in the ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"A lover there certainly is," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby;
<Q>but he was of her aunt's chu&s;ing; and it is from this lover &s;he fled.</Q></P>
<P>"O brave girl!" &s;aid my lord;
<Q>but is &s;he not fled to a lover of her own chu&s;ing?</Q>
"No, I believe not," &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid my lord,
<Q>I fancy &s;he has de|ceived you, and that the gentleman who is with her now is her lover; he is a plain &s;ort of man, Mrs. Eccles &s;ays, and looks like a merchant.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh!" &s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>it is Mr. Bale her guardian, I &s;uppo&s;e.</Q>
<Q>But this is a young man,</Q>
&s;aid my lord."
<Q>Then per|haps it is her brother,</Q>
&s;aid mi&s;s Woodby,
<Q>who was abroad with a nobleman, and is now returned.</Q></P>
<P>"I think I hear him coming down &s;tairs," &s;aid my lord,
<Q>I have a mind to &s;ee him, as he goes out.</Q>
Saying this, he bowed and ran into the &s;hop, leaving mi&s;s Woodby a little confu&s;ed at his abrupt departure; and now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;he reflected that &s;he had been indi&s;creet, and revealed too much of her friend's &s;ituation: but being incapable of taking any great intere&s;t in the concerns of another, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="20 pages">
<P><PB N="217" REF="208">Mr. Bale a&s;ked her pardon for not having con&s;ulted her before on that &s;ubject; but &s;aid, that by &s;till continuing the name of Ben&s;on, &s;he would be more &s;ecure from the &s;earch her aunt might make for her.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;ir," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>I am afraid my aunt is too much offended to be at any pains to find me out&mdash;I am more ap|prehen&s;ive of the contrivances of Mr. Dan|vers; he no doubt has &s;trong rea&s;ons for putting her upon &s;uch har&s;h mea&s;ures. While I was alone and unprotected, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal my&s;elf, &s;ince it was not impo&s;&s;ible but I might have been forced away; but I am &s;ure no &s;uch attempt will be made, when it is known that I am under my guar|dian's protection. I think therefore this gen|tlewoman ought to be acquainted with my name. I would avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible the appearance of my&s;tery. I &s;hall never recol|lect, without pain, the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity that has reduced me to it.</Q></P>
<P>"It will not be prudent," &s;aid Mr. Bale,
<Q>to alter our mea&s;ures now: I have called you mi&s;s Ben&s;on; the di&s;covery of your true name will come with more propriety from my father, when he has accommodated matters between your aunt and you: we may expect a letter
<PB N="218" REF="209">
from him in a day or two, in which he will probably fix the time of his return. In the mean while I hope you will find your&s;elf agreeably &s;ituated here&mdash; I have agreed for your board and lodging.</Q></P>
<P>"At a moderate price, I hope," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>my circum&s;tances do not entitle me to great expence.</Q>
<Q>I have taken care of that,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Bale. Mrs. Willis coming in that moment, he recommended mi&s;s Cour|teney to her care, promi&s;ing, when he heard from his father, to come immediately with the news. He then took his leave, and Mrs. Willis conducted her fair lodger to another parlour, where the cloth was laid for dinner, and intro|duced two pretty children to her, a boy and a girl, with whom the young lady was extremely plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>There was in the countenance of this woman &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s and complacency, and &s;uch an unaffected politene&s;s in her behaviour, that Henrietta found her&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;po&s;ed to like her, and was plea&s;ed to hear her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll naturally into an account of her&s;elf with a frankne&s;s and &s;implicity that denoted the goodne&s;s of her heart&punc;</P>
<P>From what &s;he &s;aid, mi&s;s Courteney col+lected that &s;he had made a marriage of choic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rather than of prudence, and that indu&s;try ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="219" REF="210">
&s;upplied the place of fortune: She found &s;he was under great obligations to the elder Mr. Bale, who had &s;ettled her hu&s;band in an advantageous way at Leghorn, where he acted as his factor, and had enabled her to furni&s;h that large hou&s;e, in a very genteel manner, for the reception of &s;uch merchants as came from abroad, and were by him recommended to lodge with her. Her extreme tenderne&s;s for her hu&s;band, which had hurried her to Leghorn upon hearing that he was ill, that &s;he might have the &s;atisfaction of attending him her&s;elf, and her anxiety for her children, which brought her back as &s;oon as he was recovered, that &s;he might re-a&s;&s;ume her care of them, were qualities which won her the e&s;teem of mi&s;s Courteney. She marked with what becoming re&s;erve &s;he &s;lightly touched upon her family and connections, which were very genteel, and by which Henrietta accounted for the ea&s;y politene&s;s of her manners and beha|viour, &s;o &s;eldom found in per&s;ons of her rank.</P>
<P>The young lady then turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon her guardian's &s;on, who&s;e character &s;he was de&s;irous of being acquainted with. Mrs. Willis told her, that he was a &s;ober diligent young man, and though the heir of immen&s;e riches, yet applied him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s with as much indu&s;try as if he had had his fortune to
<PB N="220" REF="211">
make: that he had for &s;everal years tran&s;acted his father's bu&s;ine&s;s in Holland, from whence he was but lately returned; and that he traded largely for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>Before I went to Leghorn (added &s;he) there was &s;ome talk of his being to be married to the daughter of a very rich citizen; but &s;ince my return, which was about a week ago, I have heard nothing of it, not having &s;een Mr. Bale till the day that he came to tell me I &s;hould be &s;o happy as to have you, madam, for my lodger.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Courteney having pa&s;&s;ed this day more agreeably than &s;he had done any &s;ince &s;he had left her aunt, was at night conducted by Mrs. Willis to a genteel apartment, con&s;i&s;ting of a bed-chamber and dre&s;&s;ing-room. She di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the maid whom Mrs. Willis ordered to attend and undre&s;s her; and being greatly fatigued for want of re&s;t the preceding night, lo&s;t all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er cares, her anxieties, and re&s;entments, in the &s;weet oblivion of a calm and uninterrupted &s;leep.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The hi&s;tory &s;till advances.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta, though an early ri&s;er, and though &s;he ro&s;e next morning earlier than u&s;ual, yet found, upon her going down, Mrs. Willis had waited breakfa&s;t for her &s;ome time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the tea-equipage was removed, &s;he retired to leave Mrs. Willis at liberty to go about her dome&s;tick affairs; and, when alone, was again a&s;&s;aulted with all tho&s;e cruel reflec|tions which had almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly filled her mind &s;ince her flight from her aunt. Among the&s;e, mi&s;s Woodby's treachery &s;ugge&s;ted none of the lea&s;t painful: &s;he was a&s;hamed of her credulity, of her ill-placed confidence; indigna|tion for the &s;hocking treatment &s;he had met with from her &s;ucceeded. She was upon the point of &s;itting down to write to her, and to expre&s;s the deepe&s;t re&s;entment of her malice and trea|chery; when, recollecting the extreme levity of that young woman's temper, her ridiculous affectation, her folly, and in&s;en&s;ibility, &s;he thought it would ill become her to make &s;erious remon&s;trances to one who only merited con|tempt;
<PB N="222" REF="213">
that by taking no further notice of her, that contempt would be be&s;t expre&s;&s;ed, and her own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the part &s;he had acted would account for it.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus ruminating, Mrs. Willis's maid introduced two porters bringing in a large trunk to her apartment. They delivered her the key &s;ealed up, and a letter from Mr. Bale, in which he informed her, he would wait on her that afternoon.</P>
<P>She opened the trunk trembling; it contained all her cloaths, linen, and all the trinkets her aunt had given her. She &s;earched eagerly in it to &s;ee if there was a letter for her; but finding none, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, and bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>While her aunt retained her cloaths, &s;he had formed a feeble hope that &s;he was anxious for her return, and would facilitate it, by a&s;&s;uring Mr. Bale, that &s;he would no more pre&s;s her to the hated marriage, nor think of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ining her in a convent; but now what could &s;he conclude, but that &s;he had abandoned her for ever, and that a reconciliation was not to be expected. The mo&s;t gloomy pro&s;pects offered them&s;elves to her view, poverty, dependence, neglect; but what was wor&s;e than all, the lo&s;s perhaps of reputation. How &s;hould &s;he be able to excu&s;e
<PB N="223" REF="214">
her&s;elf to the world for her late action? the world which judges actions only by their &s;ucce&s;s: and when it beheld her unhappy and reduced to indigence, would not fail to conclude her guilty.</P>
<P>In the&s;e melancholy apprehen&s;ions did &s;he wear away the hours till &s;ummoned to dinner by Mrs. Willis, who, with tender concern, per|ceived that &s;he was afflicted, but would not di&s;|cover that &s;he perceived it; and u&s;ed her utmo&s;t endeavours to amu&s;e her, yet without any appa|rent &s;olicitude, le&s;t it &s;hould alarm her &s;en&s;i|bility with a fear that her unea&s;ine&s;s was ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P>Mr. Bale came according to his promi&s;e in the afternoon: his arrival gave almo&s;t as much &s;a|tisfaction to Mrs. Willis, as to her fair anxious lodger, from a hope that it would produce &s;ome comfort to her. The young merchant in&s;tantly di&s;covered that Henrietta had been weeping; and, as &s;oon as Mrs. Willis withdrew, he ten|derly approached her, and taking her hand, a&s;ked her if any thing new had happened to give her di&s;turbance? Henrietta replied with a ha&s;ty que&s;tion,
<Q>Have you any me&s;&s;age for me from my aunt, &s;ir?</Q></P>
<P>"I cannot &s;ay I have a me&s;&s;age for you, mi&s;s," an&s;wered Mr. Bale;
<Q>your aunt has indeed
<PB N="224" REF="215">
wrote to me.</Q>
"May I not &s;ee her letter?" a&s;ked mi&s;s Courteney again, eagerly.
<Q>To be &s;ure,</Q>
&s;aid he, taking it out of his pocket, and pre&s;enting it to her,
<Q>I wi&s;h it was con|ceived in more favourable terms.</Q>
Mi&s;s Cour|tency read it trembling, and found it as fol|lows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE given directions that every thing which belongs to that unhappy girl my niece &s;hould be &s;ent to you, that if you know where &s;he is, they may be conveyed to her. She has, by her &s;candalou&s;ly running away from me, ruined her own character, and brought a&s;per|&s;ions upon mine; &s;ince even tho&s;e who con|demn her mo&s;t, will likewi&s;e blame me, as if I had acted unkindly towards her.</P>
<P>May the lo&s;s of my affection be the lea&s;t of her misfortunes; though the wor&s;t that can po&s;&s;ibly happen are likely to be the puni&s;hment of her ingratitude and folly.</P>

<P>Henrietta returned the letter to Mr. Bale with a &s;igh.
<Q>I have indeed (&s;aid &s;he) irrecoverably lo&s;t her affection: but, &s;ir, it is fit my aunt &s;hould know where I am, and that I &s;olicited your protection as &s;oon as I could. This will
<PB N="225" REF="216">
pre&s;erve me from &s;ome of tho&s;e unfavourable &s;u&s;picions which &s;he mentions &s;o &s;everely. I will write to her in&s;tantly.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh! no, by no means," &s;aid Mr. Bale,
<Q>I think it will be be&s;t for me to make a vi&s;it to lady Meadows, and tell her, that you are under my care, and that I have placed you here.</Q></P>
<P>"And will you take the trouble to go to Wind&s;or, &s;ir," &s;aid mi&s;s Courtency, extremely delighted with this expedient.
<Q>I would go any where,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Bale,
<Q>to &s;erve you. Pray make your&s;elf ea&s;y.</Q></P>
<P>"I &s;hall be ea&s;ier," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>when my aunt knows that this &s;candalous run|away is under proper protection, and is ac|countable for all her actions to your father. Perhaps &s;he may relent when &s;he is convinced I am not &s;o indi&s;creet as &s;he imagined, and that I had no other motive for leaving her but the fear of being confined in a convent. If you find my aunt ab&s;olutely re&s;olved not to be re|conciled to me, I mu&s;t then con&s;ider how to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf in a way more &s;uitable to my circum&s;tances.</Q></P>
<P>"Remember, mi&s;s," &s;aid Mr. Bale, with &s;ome emotion,
<Q>that you are under my care&mdash; I hope you will take no re&s;olutions without acquaint|ing me.</Q>
"No, certainly," replied Hen|rietta&mdash;
<Q><PB N="226" REF="217">but, &s;ir, I have no fortune; I am lodged, attended, and treated, as if I had a very con&s;iderable one. This expence I &s;hall not be willing to &s;upport a great while longer, it will break in too much upon that trifling &s;um, which was put into your father's hands, for my brother's u&s;e as well as mine. Heaven knows (&s;aid &s;he, &s;ighing) whether he is alive; if he is, he will probably need it; if he is not, it will go but a very little way in &s;upporting me in the manner in which I now live.</Q></P>
<P>While Henrietta was &s;peaking in this manner, Mr. Bale &s;eemed ready to interrupt her &s;everal times, but checked him&s;elf as if upon better re|collection; when &s;he was &s;ilent, he walked about the room, mu&s;ing; then &s;uddenly turning to|wards her,</P>
<P><Q>The&s;e con&s;iderations, mi&s;s (&s;aid he) ought at lea&s;t to be po&s;tponed till my father's return, and I think you may rely upon his prudence: he will certainly take care that your expences &s;hall not exceed your income; in placing you here, I have done what I thought would be agreeable to him.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta, ob&s;erving that he was in &s;ome con|fu&s;ion, was concerned that &s;he had &s;poke &s;o freely, being apprehen&s;ive that he under&s;tood what &s;he had &s;aid as a di&s;tru&s;t of his prudence. She there|fore
<PB N="227" REF="218">
told him, that if he found her aunt impla|cable, &s;he would be extremely well &s;atisfied to continue with Mrs. Willis as long as Mr. Bale &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;urance &s;atisfied the young merchant, who left her with a promi&s;e to &s;ee lady Meadows the next day, and to wait on her as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, with an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed this interval in a &s;tate of anxiety and &s;u&s;pence, that doubled every hour. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw Mr. Bale again, &s;he endeavoured to read in his countenance, before he &s;poke, the news he had brought her.</P>
<P>"Well, mi&s;s (&s;aid he) I have &s;een your aunt." He pau&s;ed; and Henrietta, in a &s;altering accent, begged him to tell her in one word, whether he had &s;ucceeded or not?</P>
<P><Q>Indeed I have not (&s;aid he) lady Meadows &s;eems re&s;olved never to forgive you for running away from her; but don't de&s;pair, my father may have more weight with her.</Q>
<Q>It is at lea&s;t &s;ome comfort (&s;aid &s;he) that &s;he knows I am under your protection.</Q>
<Q>I have a letter from my father,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Bale,
<Q>he has got the gout in his right hand; he dic|tated it to one of his clerks, and therefore &s;peaks with re&s;erve of you. He de&s;ires me to tell you, that he hopes to be in London in

three weeks at farthe&s;t, when he will u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to reconcile you to your aunt; and, in the mean time, recommends you mo&s;t affectionately to my care.</Q></P>
<P>This account of her guardian's kind concern for her, gave &s;ome relief to the depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of mi&s;s Courteney, who, although &s;he had not flattered her&s;elf with any hope from the young merchant's mediation with her aunt, was as much &s;hocked at the confirmation of her continued di&s;plea&s;ure, as if &s;he had not expected it. How|ever, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a grateful &s;en&s;e of his &s;er|vices, and di&s;po&s;ed her&s;elf to wait with patience for the arrival of Mr. Bale, who alone could d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+termine her de&s;tiny.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing &s;everal my&s;terious circum&s;tances.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HEnrietta had been about a fortnight in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Willis, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e and polite behaviour had entirely won her e&s;teem, when, on a &s;udden, &s;he became re&s;erv|ed and thoughtful, and often failed in tho&s;e little attentions which mark re&s;pect, and an extreme willingne&s;s to oblige. She, who had avoided the lea&s;t appearance of curio&s;ity to know more of her affairs than what &s;he plea&s;ed to di&s;clo&s;e, now a&s;ked que&s;tions with an inqui&s;itive air, and &s;eemed to &s;eek for occa&s;ions of collecting a fuller knowledge of her from her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Henrietta had in&s;i&s;ted upon her being made acquainted with her true name and circum|&s;tances, from the time that Mr. Bale had ac|knowledged to her aunt that &s;he was under his care, which had produced no other alteration in Mrs. Willis than rather an increa&s;e of re&s;pect towards her, which &s;he conceived due to her birth.</P>
<P>The young lady, who&s;e extreme &s;en&s;ibility was not the lea&s;t of her misfortunes, ob&s;erved her
<PB N="230" REF="221">
increa&s;ing coldne&s;s, and &s;uffered great unea&s;i|ne&s;s. She had willingly indulged a tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem for her; and was concerned to find from her altered behaviour, that either &s;he had failed in her endeavours to acquire the friend&s;hip of Mrs. Willis, or that the woman whom &s;he had conceived &s;o good an opinion of, was in reality not de&s;erving of hers.</P>
<P>However, &s;he was determined not to let Mr. Bale perceive that &s;he was di&s;&s;atisfied with her behaviour; and &s;he continued to live with her in the &s;ame ea&s;y manner as formerly, notwith&s;tanding the coldne&s;s and con&s;traint with which &s;he was now treated.</P>
<P>Mr. Bale &s;carce ever failed to call and &s;ee her once a day; but one day he returned about an hour after he had been with her, and told her he had ju&s;t received letters from his father, in which he acquainted him that Mrs. Willis would in a few days have &s;everal foreign merchants in her hou&s;e, whom he had recommended to lodge with her; and that, his &s;tay in Holland being protracted for &s;ome time longer, he thought it would not be proper for mi&s;s Courteney to re&s;ide with Mrs. Willis till his return, as her hou&s;e would be full of men.</P>
<P>"My father," added Mr. Bale,
<Q>de&s;ires me to a&s;k you, mi&s;s, whether you have any objection
<PB N="231" REF="222">
to go into the country for a few weeks. He has a di&s;tant relation, a widow, who lives at Hamp&s;tead, with whom he &s;ays he will be glad to find you at his return; he begs you will excu&s;e his not writing to you, having the gout &s;till in his hand, and de&s;ires me to a&s;&s;ure you of his tendere&s;t concern for your welfare.</Q></P>
<P>A week before, Henrietta would have thought it a misfortune to have left Mrs. Willis to go into any other lodging; but &s;he was &s;o piqued by her behaviour, that &s;he heard this news without any unea&s;ine&s;s, and told Mr. Bale &s;he would implicitly follow her guardian's direc|tions.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he would conduct her to his cou&s;in's him&s;elf; and took leave of her, after he had de|&s;ired her to be ready for her little journey the next day.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis came up to her apartment &s;oon after Mr. Bale went away.
<Q>I hear I am &s;oon to lo&s;e you, mi&s;s,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, entering. "Yes," replied mi&s;s Courteney cooly,
<Q>&s;uch is my guardian's plea&s;ure; but,</Q>
added &s;he &s;miling,
<Q>you will not mi&s;s me; you will have other company.</Q>
"Other company!" repeated Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>"Mr. Bale tells me," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>that your hou&s;e will be full &s;oon; &s;ome gen|tlemen
<PB N="232" REF="223">
recommended by his father will be here.</Q></P>
<P>"It is &s;trange," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>that I &s;hould know nothing of it; have you had a letter from your guardian, mi&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>"No," replied mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>but his &s;on has heard from him&mdash;But,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, after a little pau&s;e,
<Q>it is &s;trange, as you &s;ay, that you &s;hould not know you are to have new lodgers.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Willis looked at her attentively, as &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words, "May I a&s;k you, mi&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, "the cau&s;e of your &s;udden removal?"</P>
<P>"I know of none," replied mi&s;s Courteney;
<Q>but that, my guardian thinks it will not be proper for me to &s;tay among &s;o many gentle|men as will &s;hortly be your lodgers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I wi&s;h there had been a better rea&s;on than that,</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Willis;
<Q>for I am very &s;ure I am to have no lodgers recommended by the elder Mr. Bale, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have known it.</Q></P>
<P>"Has not his &s;on told you &s;o?" a&s;ked mi&s;s Courteney, in great confu&s;ion of thought.</P>
<P>"He told me nothing," replied Mrs. Willis, "but that you are to leave me to-morrow."</P>
<P>"Lord ble&s;s me," cried the young lady, in great emotion, "what can this mean!"</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="224">"Suffer me," &s;aid Mrs. Willis, looking on her with tenderne&s;s and concern,
<Q>to a&s;k you a few que&s;tions: when you know my motives, I am &s;ure you will not think that it is an imper|tinent curio&s;ity which makes me take this li|berty, but my anxiety for you.</Q></P>
<P>"Dear madam," interrupted mi&s;s Courteney,
<Q>a&s;k me what you plea&s;e: you alarm me ex|ce&s;&s;ively.</Q></P>
<P>"I would not alarm you," &s;aid Mrs. Willis;
<Q>but I will own to you that I have fears, nay more that I have had doubts; but I &s;ee I have been to blame with regard to the latter: has Mr. Bale &s;hewn you his father's letters, mi&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>"Shewn them to me!" repeated Henrietta,
<Q>no&mdash;but &s;ure&mdash;dear Mrs. Willis explain your|&s;elf&mdash;I am ready to &s;ink with the apprehen|&s;ions you have rai&s;ed in my mind.</Q></P>
<P>"Compo&s;e your&s;elf, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Willis, drawing her chair nearer to her, and taking her hand tenderly.
<Q>I mean you well; be a&s;&s;ured I do: and now I will tell you all that has been upon my mind for &s;everal days pa&s;t. Never did I imagine that I &s;hould en|tertain unfavourable &s;u&s;picions of the &s;on of my benefactor; but indeed, my dear mi&s;s,
<PB N="234" REF="225">
I am afraid he has not acted ingenuou&s;ly by you.</Q></P>
<P>That moment a loud knocking at the door interrupted Mrs. Willis. She &s;tarted from her chair. "Who can this be?" &s;aid &s;he in &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; "I will go and &s;ee." She ran ha&s;tily out of the room; but returning again in&s;tantly, "Po&s;&s;ibly," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>it may be Mr. Bale: remember, mi&s;s, that it is my advice to you not to leave my hou&s;e, if he &s;hould de&s;ire you, at lea&s;t till you have heard what I have to &s;ay.</Q></P>
<P>She uttered the&s;e words with extreme earne&s;t|ne&s;s and concern, and went immediately down &s;tairs, leaving Henrietta in an agony of doubt, anxiety, and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Her &s;urpri&s;e kept her motionle&s;s in her chair, till &s;he was rou&s;ed by the voice of a woman upon the &s;tairs that led to her apartment, whom &s;he heard &s;ay, with great haughtine&s;s of accent,
<Q>No, there is no occa&s;ion for that ceremony; I &s;hall go in without introduction, I a&s;&s;ure you.</Q></P>
<P>She &s;uddenly &s;tarted from her chair, and was going towards the door, when &s;he &s;aw it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ung open with &s;ome violence, and a lady of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;agreeable figure but richly dre&s;&s;ed, and in the utmo&s;t extremity of the fa&s;hion, appear at the entrance.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="226">Mi&s;s Courteney, recovering a little from her &s;urpri&s;e, looked at the lady, in order to recol|lect whether &s;he had ever &s;een her before; but being wholly unacquainted with her features, and ob&s;erving that &s;he &s;tood &s;till and gazed at her without &s;peaking, &s;he concluded the vi&s;it could not be de&s;igned for her.</P>
<P>"I fancy, madam," &s;aid &s;he, approaching her,
<Q>you are mi&s;taken; I am not the per&s;on you &s;eek.</Q></P>
<P>"No, <HI>madam,</HI>" returned the lady with an "empha&s;is, "I am not mi&s;taken;" then throw|ing her&s;elf haughtily into a chair,
<Q>I &s;hall not a&s;k your leave,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, with a malignant &s;mile,
<Q>to &s;it down in this apartment; I may take that liberty with what belongs to Mr. Bale&mdash;Do you know me pray, <HI>madam.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"Not I, truly," replied mi&s;s Courteney, indignation at this in&s;olent treatment having bani&s;hed her former terror and &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;eat|ing her&s;elf, with a carele&s;s air, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to her,
<Q>Pray let me know what is your bu&s;i|ne&s;s with me,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Port creature!" &s;aid the &s;tranger, affecting contempt, while her lips quivered with rage, and her whole frame &s;eemed convul&s;ed with the violence of her emotions:
<Q>What! you would
<PB N="236" REF="227">
have me under&s;tand you to be a woman of fortune, would you not?&mdash;Upon my word,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, looking round her,
<Q>this is a very hand&s;ome apartment. Your dre&s;&s;ing-room, for&s;ooth! You have your forms, no doubt, and receive company in your dre&s;&s;ing-room in a morning. A very genteel di&s;habi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> too; and your face varni&s;hed over &s;o nicely!&mdash; Who would not conclude that white and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be natural?</Q></P>
<P>"You are come here to in&s;ult me, I find," &s;aid Henrietta, her fine face glowing with in|dignation.&mdash;
<Q>I cannot imagine what cau&s;e I have given you for this &s;trange rudene&s;s. I never, as I can remember, ever &s;aw you be|fore; and in&s;i&s;t upon your quitting my apart|ment. You can have no bu&s;ine&s;s with me, I am &s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed but I have, minx," &s;aid the &s;tranger, with the pale rage of a fury;
<Q>and my bu&s;ine&s;s is to turn you out of this apartment: my for|tune &s;hall not be wa&s;ted in &s;upporting &s;uch wretches.</Q></P>
<P>"Your fortune!" cried mi&s;s Courteney, in a&s;toni&s;hment:
<Q>What have I to do with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or your fortune?&mdash;Who are you?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="228">This moment Mrs. Willis entered the room: "Excu&s;e me, ladies," &s;aid &s;he;
<Q>I heard high words between you.</Q></P>
<P>"Ladies!" interrupted the &s;tranger:
<Q>how dare you, woman, join me with &s;uch a crea|ture?&mdash;What bu&s;ine&s;s have you to intrude?</Q></P>
<P>"Madam," replied Mrs. Willis,
<Q>I came to inform this young lady, my boarder, who you are: &s;he does not know you.&mdash;Mi&s;s, this is young Mr. Bale's lady.</Q></P>
<P>"What!" cried Henrietta, in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, "is Mr. Bale married?"</P>
<P>"Oh&mdash;you are &s;urpri&s;ed then," &s;aid the lady, with a &s;neer:
<Q>di&s;appointed too, perhaps.&mdash; You had the confidence, I &s;uppo&s;e, to think he would have married you one of the&s;e days!&mdash;Tell me, you wicked thing, did he ever give you &s;uch hopes?&mdash;Oh I could tear his eyes out!</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing, and walking about the room like one frantick, while the enormous length of her negligee &s;wept the room, like the train of a tragedy-queen.&mdash;
<Q>A wretch, to u&s;e me thus! me, who has brought him &s;uch a fortune! But I'll be revenged: he &s;hall never have a quiet moment. I'll make him know what it is to &s;light a woman of virtue.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="229">All this time Henrietta continued &s;ilent, rooted in her chair, and with difficulty re&s;trained the angui&s;h of her heart from ri&s;ing to her eyes, le&s;t this outrageous woman of virtue &s;hould exult in her di&s;tre&s;s, yet &s;he &s;aw that &s;he was betrayed; that Mr. Bale had acted weakly, if not ba&s;ely&punc; her reputation was ruined, yet &s;he would not &s;toop &s;o low as to enter into any ju&s;tification of her|&s;elf to a woman who had treated her &s;o cruelly, upon a bare &s;u&s;picion. The pride of affronted virtue came to her aid, again&s;t that torrent of overwhelming grief, which had for &s;ome mo|ments ab&s;orbed all her faculties: &s;he ro&s;e from her chair, and approaching Mrs. Bale,</P>
<P>"The error you are in," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>would have moved my compa&s;&s;ion, had you treated me with le&s;s in&s;olence. I &s;corn to undeceive you.&mdash;Go, learn from your hu&s;band who I am; and blu&s;h, if you can, for the injurious language you have given a per&s;on as much your &s;uperior by birth, as in that virtue perhaps of which you boa&s;t, and which has not with|held you from &s;uch indecent tran&s;ports of jea|lou&s;y, as it would become a virtuous woman to &s;uppre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;uperiority with which &s;he &s;poke, the dignity of her air and manner, &s;truck her mean-&s;ouled adver&s;ary with &s;uch awe, that &s;he con|tinued
<PB N="239" REF="230">
&s;ilent for &s;ome moments, with her hag|gard looks fixed on her. Envy, at the view of &s;o lovely a form, added new &s;tings to her rage and jealou&s;y. At length, &s;he poured forth a torrent of reproaches, with &s;uch eagerne&s;e of malice, that her words were &s;carce intelligible.</P>
<P>"I am not u&s;ed to &s;colding," &s;aid mi&s;s Courteney, calmly, retiring towards her bed|chamber,
<Q>and you, Mrs. Bale, &s;eem to be an excellent &s;cold.</Q></P>
<P>The lady, provoked at this appellation, em|ployed the coar&s;e&s;t language imaginable to ex|pre&s;s her re&s;entment of the injury; but mi&s;s Courteney took &s;helter in her bedchamber, the door of which &s;he double-locked.</P>
<P>"In&s;olent trollop," &s;aid Mrs. Bale, rai&s;ing her voice that &s;he might hear her,
<Q>call me &s;cold!

I am pretty certain you have i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d this young lady by your &s;u&s;picions.</Q></P>
<P>"Young lady!" interrupted Mrs. Bale,
<Q>What makes her a lady?&mdash;A fine world it is, now-adays, when beggars are called ladies. I would fain know what fortune &s;he has to put her upon a footing with ladies.</Q></P>
<P>"I know nothing of her fortune, madam," &s;aid Mrs. Willis.</P>
<P>"Fortune! poor wretch!" &s;aid Mrs. Bale:

<P>"I don't know, really," replied Mrs. Willis. "Well then," &s;aid Mrs. Bale,
<Q>why do you give her a title &s;he has no right to? But why do I talk to you, vile wretch? you are my hu&s;band's confident.</Q></P>
<P>This thought renewed all her rage, and &s;he loaded Mrs. Willis with &s;uch &s;hocking in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tives, that the poor woman could not refrain from tears.</P>

Willis a hundred &s;aucy jades, for daring to &s;ay that &s;he was capable of abu&s;ing any body; and having almo&s;t exhau&s;ted her &s;pirits with the violence of her pa&s;&s;ions, and finding that Mrs. Willis &s;at &s;ilent, and took no further notice of what &s;he &s;aid, &s;he flounced out of the room, declaring, that her father-in-law &s;hould know that &s;he acted as procure&s;s for his &s;on, and that &s;he &s;hould return to her rags and poverty again.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis thought her behaviour di&s;pen&s;ed with her from treating her with that re&s;pect, which &s;he would have otherwi&s;e paid to Mr. Bale's daughter-in-law, and therefore did not offer to wait on her down &s;tairs, but rung the bell for &s;omebody to attend her, and, locking the door after her, &s;he tapped gently at mi&s;s Courteney's chamber-door, telling her, that Mrs. Bale was gone.</P>
<P>Who is this fury?" &s;aid the young lady, as &s;he came out.
<Q>You have been treated very ill by her, Mrs. Willis, I am &s;orry for it.</Q>
<Q>And I am &s;orry for what you have &s;uffered, my dear mi&s;s,</Q>

<P>"To be &s;ure that was very &s;trange," repiled Henrietta, "what could he mean by it!"</P>
<P>"Ah! mi&s;s," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>a very little reflection on Mr. Bale's behaviour might have informed you that he was in love with you.</Q></P>

<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>in love with you; if that can be called love, which &s;eeks the ruin of its object. I &s;aw it in his looks, his words, cautious as they were, his whole behaviour &s;hewed it but too plainly.</Q></P>

<P>In which tho&s;e circum&s;tances are partly ex|plained.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>YOU may remember I told you, &s;oon after you came here, that before I went to Leghorn, I heard Mr. Bale was courting the daughter of a rich citizen; I had been re|turned but three or four days, when he came to me to know if I could accommodate a young lady, a ward of his father's, with lodging and board; to which I readily con|&s;ented.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is no flattery, mi&s;s, to tell you, that when I &s;aw you, I was charmed with your per&s;on and behaviour: your beauty, and Mr. Bale's extreme a&s;&s;iduity, made it &s;eem highly probable that he loved you. I &s;et my&s;elf to examine his behaviour, and the ob&s;ervations I made on it confirmed my &s;u&s;picions. I had then heard nothing of his being married, having upon my return been &s;o taken up with

my dome&s;tick affairs, that I had no lei&s;ure to make or receive vi&s;its, from which I could re|ceive any information concerning what had happened in my ab&s;ence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find that you had been introduced to me under a feigned name, and that you were not called Ben&s;on, but Courteney. However, I made no reflections upon that circum&s;tance, till, about t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s afterwards, I accidentally heard that Mr. Bale had been married two months; then it was, that in my a&s;toni&s;hment at his &s;o contiou&s;ly avoiding any mention of his wife, I was led to reflect upon what you your&s;elf had informed me of your &s;ituation, your flight from your friends; Mr. Bale's apparent tenderne&s;s for you awakened &s;u&s;picions: I own it di&s;advan|tageous to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I waited impatiently for the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Mr. Bale's vi&s;iting you, and the moment I &s;aw him wi&s;hed him joy on his marriage, expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urpri&s;e that I &s;hould not have heard of that event from him&s;elf. He coloured, and &s;eemed in great confu&s;ion; and, after a little pau&s;e, Have you &s;aid any thing of it to mi&s;s Courteney? &s;aid he.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="236">"I replied that I had heard the news but an "hour before, and had not &s;een you &s;ince.</P>
<P><Q>You will oblige me (&s;aid he) if you will not mention it to her&mdash; I &s;tared&mdash; My wife (continued he) is the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable wo|man in the world; &s;he has taken it into her head to be horribly jealous of me, though we have been married &s;o &s;hort a time&mdash; It was a match (and he &s;ighed) of my father's making &mdash; but I a&s;&s;ure you I am very un|happy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry for it, &s;ir (interrupted I) but what rea&s;ons have you for concealing from mi&s;s Courteney that you are married?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is a &s;ad thing, Mrs. Willis (&s;aid he) when a man is not ma&s;ter in his own family. I hope that is not your ca&s;e, &s;ir, an&s;wered I. Indeed but it is, he replied. Mi&s;s Courte|ney, you know, is agreeable. Oh! very agreeable, &s;aid I. My wife is of &s;uch an un|accountable humour (re&s;umed he) that I dur&s;t not offer mi&s;s Courteney, though my father is her guardian, an a&s;ylum in my hou&s;e, till her relations were reconciled to her, le&s;t I &s;hould be teazed with jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;pi|cions.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="237">
<Q>I am per&s;uaded, &s;ir (&s;aid I) that mi&s;s Cour|teney has too much good &s;en&s;e to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;s that you did not invite her to your hou&s;e as things were circum&s;tanced. She has more rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed at your concealing your marriage from her, which every body knows, and which &s;he would &s;oon know if &s;he lived le&s;s retired.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let me intreat you, Mrs. Willis (&s;aid he) not to mention it to mi&s;s Courteney. I would not upon any account that &s;he &s;hould know I am married, yet could not offer her an apart|ment in my hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed, &s;ir (&s;aid I, &s;miling) you make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> matter of more con&s;equence than you need to do; mi&s;s Courteney will not con&s;ider it as any &s;light to her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She mu&s;t either think her&s;elf &s;lighted (re|&s;umed he, with quickne&s;s) by my not invi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her, or &s;he will divine the rea&s;on, which would be wor&s;e; for in that ca&s;e, her delicacy is &s;o extreme, that &s;he would never allow me to &s;ee her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, thought I, is it &s;o! He perceived he had almo&s;t betrayed him&s;elf; and changed the di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;king me many que&s;tions about my hu&s;band, who&s;e diligence and fidelity he highly extolled, dropping hints of de&s;igns in his &s;a|vour;
<PB N="247" REF="238">
and indeed it is in his power to be of great &s;ervice to him.</Q></P>
<P>"But I had no &s;atisfaction," pur&s;ued Mrs. Willis,
<Q>in what he &s;aid; for, to my appre|hen&s;ion, it appeared as if he &s;ought to bribe me into a concurrence with his de&s;igns, what|ever they were. Therefore I &s;at &s;ilent, and I believe di&s;covered by my looks, that I did not like his proceedings; for he ro&s;e up, and, with an air of &s;ome re&s;entment, &s;aid,</Q></P>
<P><Q>That his father would be in town in a few days, and would then di&s;po&s;e of you properly; and that in the mean time he mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon my being &s;ilent with regard to his marriage, &s;ince it would throw him into great confu&s;ion if you knew it; and added, that he thought he might rea&s;onably expect this in&s;tance of my complai&s;ance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I told him that I was very glad to hear his father would be in town &s;o &s;oon, and would take the young lady under his own care: that &s;ince he de&s;ired it, I would not be the fir&s;t to acquaint you with his marriage; I owned his rea&s;ons appeared to me very whim&s;ical: but that it was not my bu&s;ine&s;s to be impertinently curious; and that I &s;hould concern my&s;elf no farther about it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="239">
<Q>He &s;eemed plea&s;ed with this indifference, and went up &s;tairs to &s;ee you. I had already taken my re&s;olution, my dear mi&s;s Courteney, which was to write to his father, and ac|quaint him with the whole tran&s;action. I was willing to leave the young gentleman in a fal&s;e &s;ecurity, that he might not &s;u&s;pect my de&s;ign, and take mea&s;ures to render it u&s;ele&s;s; and not being &s;ure how far even you might be tru&s;ted, for my &s;u&s;picions of you, though weakened, were not yet removed, I thought it be&s;t to &s;ay nothing that could alarm you, till I had received the old gentleman's advice how to act; but my mea&s;ures were broke by Mr. Bale's re&s;olving to take you from my hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He came into the parlour to me to-day, be|fore you &s;aw him, and told me, that he had directions from his father to &s;end you into the country, becau&s;e he did not expect to return for &s;ome time yet, and he did not approve of your re&s;iding in London till he came.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may ea&s;ily imagine, mi&s;s, that I was not &s;atisfied with the cau&s;e he a&s;&s;igned for this &s;udden re&s;olution. I was now alarmed for you; and judged it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint you imme|diately with Mr. Bale's being married, that
<PB N="249" REF="240">
you might not fall ignorantly into his &s;nares. I began with asking you que&s;tions, to which the openne&s;s and &s;implicity of your an&s;wers convinced me that you were impo&s;ed upon greatly by Mr. Bale. I was going to explain my&s;elf clearly, when Mrs. Bale's arrival in|terrupted me. You know with what earne&s;t|ne&s;s I intreated you not to leave my hou&s;e; I was apprehen&s;ive that he was come to hurry you away, and I trembled for the danger to which you were expo&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When I left you, I met Mrs. Bale upon the &s;tairs; and, not knowing her, I asked, who it was &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee? The young woman that lodges with you, &s;aid &s;he, in a tone of voice that &s;urpri&s;ed me. I told her, I would go and acquaint you that there was a lady wanted to &s;peak to you: but &s;he ru&s;hed by me, &s;aying, there is no need of that ce|remony, I &s;hall introduce my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Her behaviour recalling to my mind what Mr. Bale had &s;aid of his wife's jealou&s;y, I &s;u&s;pected this was the lady; and, to be a&s;|&s;ured, I enquired of a &s;ervant, who attended her, who &s;he was. The moment I knew it was really her, I flew up &s;tairs, being full of concern for you; for I &s;aw a &s;torm in her
<PB N="250" REF="241">
countenance, and dreaded the con&s;equence&mdash; The poor young man is indeed plagued with a jealous wife; and in that particular he told the truth. But, my dear mi&s;s, I &s;ee plainly that the my&s;tery he has made of his connexi|ons with you has rouzed her &s;u&s;picions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is all an incomprehen&s;ible my&s;tery to me,</Q>
&s;aid Henrietta, &s;ighing:
<Q>Mr. Bale has certainly deceived me, for what purpo&s;es I know not; but I know that I will never &s;ee him again, but in the pre&s;ence of his father, to have this dark affair cleared up.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But, my dear Mrs. Willis, how &s;hall I ex|pre&s;s what my heart feels for you, who have &s;hewn &s;o tender a regard for my honour and quiet&mdash; How mi&s;erable might I have been, had you been le&s;s good&mdash;I am &s;ure I may rely upon your prudence&mdash; Advi&s;e me then what to do: you know my &s;tory; you &s;ee my pre&s;ent &s;ituation&mdash; I have no friend, no pro|tector.</Q></P>
<P>"My dear mi&s;s," interrupted Mrs. Willis,
<Q>there is but one thing for you to do, and that is, to return to your aunt.</Q></P>
<P>"How can I appear before her?" &s;aid Hen|rietta,
<Q>after having &s;o greatly di&s;obliged her
<PB N="251" REF="242">
by my flight; a flight which has had &s;uch di&s;|graceful con&s;equences. Be&s;ides, do not the &s;ame motives that obliged me to leave her, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t? and are they not equally &s;trong again&s;t my returning?</Q></P>
<P>"I would not pain you, my dear mi&s;s," &s;aid Mrs. Willis,
<Q>with the recollection of a pa&s;t error, were it not to make it u&s;eful to you in your pre&s;ent circum&s;tances&mdash; Warned as you were of your aunt's de&s;igns, it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry them into execution without your concurrence: your flight therefore was not nece&s;&s;ary, and, if not nece&s;&s;ary, &s;urely it was highly imprudent; and, in my opinion, can only be repaired by a voluntary return.&mdash; Need I tell a young lady of your delicacy, that imputations, however unju&s;t, fully, if they do not &s;tain a character. Do you think this woman's frantic jealou&s;y will be &s;ilent? how can you otherwi&s;e prove the fal&s;hood of her a&s;&s;ertions, than by returning to your aunt, and making your&s;elf accountable to her for all your actions? Nothing can be more un|fortunate for youth and beauty, than to be left to its own guidance and di&s;cretion. The world &s;eldom attributes too much prudence to youth: however regular our conduct may be in that
<PB N="252" REF="243">
gay time of life, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to the care and attention of our parents or rela|tions, rather than to our own circum&s;pection. Can a young woman, who voluntarily &s;ets her&s;elf free from that re&s;traint, hope to e&s;cape unfavourable cen&s;ures, when tho&s;e who owe it to chance only that they are not &s;ubjected to any control, &s;uffer perhaps in the opinion of the world, becau&s;e they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a liberty which they may make an improper u&s;e of?</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;ee, my dear, to what inconveniencies you have been expo&s;ed: the&s;e are the nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equences of your unprotected &s;tate; there is no doubt but you would repel every attempt to the prejudice of your honour: but does not mode&s;ty, if not virtue, &s;uffer by &s;uch attempts? and can you acquit your&s;elf of im|prudence, when you reflect that you have thrown your&s;elf into a &s;ituation which renders you liable to them?</Q></P>
<P>"It was indeed," &s;aid Henrietta, who, by her blu&s;hes and confu&s;ion, acknowledged the &s;trength of her rea&s;ons,
<Q>imprudence to throw my&s;elf into this &s;ituation, but it would be guilt to continue in it. Oh! that I had had &s;uch a friend as you to advi&s;e with at Wind&s;or, I
<PB N="253" REF="244">
&s;hould never have taken a &s;tep, which I blu&s;h to think of now. I will return to my aunt, Mrs. Willis, I will throw my&s;elf upon her mercy; and if I mu&s;t be made a &s;acrifice of &mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed, my dear (interrupted Mrs. Willis) the&s;e fears are groundle&s;s: you cannot po&s;&s;ibly be married again&s;t your con&s;ent; and you have it always in your power to refu&s;e. As for the convent, you cannot be cheated into it, that is certain, &s;ince you know &s;he had &s;uch a de&s;ign, and may guard again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But &s;uppo&s;e (&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney) that &s;he &s;hould not receive me again; Mr. Bale found her inexorable.</Q></P>
<P>"Ah! my dear," replied Mrs. Willis, &s;haking her head,
<Q>Mr. Bale was not a fit per&s;on to be tru&s;ted with &s;uch a negociation: but, how|ever that may be, I am &s;ure, when your aunt knows in what manner he has acted, and the rea&s;ons you have to di&s;tru&s;t him, &s;he will think it nece&s;&s;ary to take you out of his hands. Your return to her will remove her &s;u&s;picions again&s;t you, and convince her that it was from a &s;udden impul&s;e of fear only, that you left her; and that you had no de&s;ire of
<PB N="254" REF="245">
di&s;po&s;ing of your&s;elf contrary to her inclina|tions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But I have one &s;avour to beg of you (&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney) and that is, that you will go along with me to my aunt; re&s;entment may &s;hut her ears to all that I can &s;ay to her, but I think, &s;he cannot re&s;i&s;t your pleas, urged with that good &s;en&s;e you po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;o high a de|gree.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Doubt not, my dear (&s;aid Mrs. Willis) but I am ready to do you any &s;ervice in my power.</Q></P>
<P>"What hinders us then from going directly?" cried Henrietta, eagerly;
<Q>we can get a po&s;t|chai&s;e, and &mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>The day is too far advanced (replied Mrs. Willis) we will, if you plea&s;e, &s;et out early to-morrow morning, I will take care to have a po&s;t-chai&s;e in readine&s;s; in the mean time you may depend upon being &s;ecure from any di&s;agreeable vi&s;its here, neither Mr. Bale nor his fury of a wife &s;hall &s;ee you, unle&s;s you de|&s;ire they &s;hould.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Notwith&s;tanding the treatment &s;he gave me (&s;aid mi&s;s Courteney) I would rather &s;ee her than him; but you may well imagine, Mrs. Willis, that I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee either of them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="246">
<Q>Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, my dear (&s;aid Mrs. Willis) you &s;hall meet with no in&s;ult of any kind in my hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Henrietta embraced her with tears of grati|tude, which the good woman returned with a parental tenderne&s;s, and then left her to give the nece&s;&s;ary directions for their little journey the next day.</P>
