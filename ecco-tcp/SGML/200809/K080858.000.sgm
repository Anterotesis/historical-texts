<L>WHEN Philip's &s;on led forth his warlike band,</L>

<L>To fan the fire, a martial mu&s;e he cho&s;e;</L>

<L>The &s;tage breath'd war&mdash;the &s;oldiers bo&s;om burn'd,</L>
<L>And fiercer to the field each chief return'd:</L>
<L>Now, when the world re&s;ounds with loud alarms,</L>
<L>When victory &s;its plan'd on Britain's arms,</L>
<L>Be war our theme: the hero's glorious toil,</L>
<L>And virtue &s;pringing from the iron &s;oil!</L>
<L>Our &s;cenes pre&s;ent a &s;iege in &s;tory known;</L>
<L>Where magnanimity, and valour &s;hone:</L>
<L>If nature guides us, if the hand of truth</L>
<L>Draws the ju&s;t portrait of a Roman youth,</L>
<L>Who, with the be&s;t and noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions &s;ir'd,</L>
<L>In the &s;ame moment, conquer'd and expir'd;</L>
<L>Perhaps your bearts may own the pictur'd woe,</L>
<L>And from a fonder &s;ource your &s;orrows flow:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t warm remembrance aids the poet's &s;train,</L>

<L>The victor &s;till was Roman, and rever'd</L>
<L>The gods and temples of immortal Rome.</L>

<LG>
<L>OUR Author, as I'm told, is not to &s;eek</L>
<L>In antient Lore; in Latin, nor in Greek.</L>
<L>I therefore did advi&s;e him, as a friend,</L>
<L>To make his learning &s;erve &s;ome u&s;eful end:</L>
<L>And let me know, what rules he had ob&s;erv'd,</L>
<L>What unities of time and place pre&s;erv'd.</L>
<L>He an&s;wer'd, Poetry is not an art;</L>
<L>'Tis nature only frames the poet's heart:</L>
<L>Still as he thinks, the &s;cene he feels along,</L>
<L>And from his bo&s;om bur&s;ts the raptur'd &s;ong.</L>
<L>This is the &s;acred oracle, the &s;hrine</L>
<L>The bard con&s;ults, and here, the tuneful Nine.</L>
<L>With the &s;ame fire, the hearer's &s;oul mu&s;t glow,</L>
<L>El&s;e vain to him, the tale of tragick woe.</L>
<L>There is a temper, which is all and all:</L>
<L>That &s;ounds re&s;pon&s;ive to the poet's call.</L>
<L>Like Memnon's harp, which pour'd harmonious lays,</L>
<L>Whene'er its &s;trings were touch'd by Phoebus' rays.</L>
<L>This temper of the &s;oul is &s;weet and wild;</L>
<L>It &s;obs, or &s;miles, as &s;udden as a child;</L>
<L>To woes imagin'd tears unfeigned gives,</L>
<L>And in the poet's world of fancy lives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whil&s;t thus he &s;poke, a bell was heard to ring;</L>
<L>He &s;top'd, and &s;tarted like a guilty thing;</L>
<L>Ere the dread curtain ro&s;e, in ha&s;te withdrew,</L>
<L>And at a di&s;tance wails his doom from you.</L>
