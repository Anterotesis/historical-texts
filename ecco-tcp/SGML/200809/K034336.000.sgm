<P>Now, Don Pi|miento, if you think I have injured you, I am ready to give you &s;atisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Pimi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Salvador, I feel the generous and no|ble manner of your proceeding. You have re&s;cued me from the power of a malignant and, mean enemy, and, without drawing your &s;word, have vanqui&s;h'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Sal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Don Pimiento, we have both been to blame. However, for my own part, I'll give you my promi&s;e never to di&s;pute about things I don't under&s;tand any more, nor ever more laugh at philo&s;ophy, e&s;pecially in your pre&s;ence.&mdash;He that does a gentleman a pecuniary favor, and afterwards takes improper liberties with him,

<P>I will own to you, Donna Zelida, that, half an hour ago, I con&s;idered you as the mo&s;t dangerous per&s;on in the world, perhaps as my enemy; I &s;hall now be proud of your friend&s;hip.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry, and a&s;hamed.&mdash;But, indeed, &s;ir, it was a trick of the &s;ellow's own invention.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend, depend.&mdash;I ob&s;erve your people in power are always exceedingly anxious to keep a man of talents in a &s;tate of dependance. They feel they have robb'd him of his birthright, and even grudge him his poor me&s;s of potage.</P>

<P>Well, &s;ir; you &s;hall find a gentleman, for once, who will keep his promi&s;e.&mdash;You have merit, and I &s;hould ill de&s;erve the happine&s;s I now enjoy, were I to let merit langui&s;h, neglected, and without its reward.</P>
