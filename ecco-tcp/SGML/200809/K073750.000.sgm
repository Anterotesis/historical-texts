<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>WELL, my dear, what d'ye think of our medical friend</L>
<L>Whom the letters of Felix &s;o highly commend?</L>
<L>If my gratitude does not my judgment mi&s;lead,</L>
<L>He's the man in the world who with you might &s;ucceed:</L>
<L>Tho' gentle, yet manly, tho' ba&s;hful, polite.</L>
<L>Are you not half in love?&mdash;</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, indeed, at fir&s;t &s;ight!&mdash;</L>
<L>His &s;ervice to you on my heart is engrav'd,</L>
<L>And I love him, I own, for the life he has &s;av'd,</L>
<L>To win me perhaps he might not find it hard,</L>
<L>So e&s;teem'd as he is by the friends I regard;</L>
<L>But I fancy &s;uch thoughts will not enter his brain:</L>
<L>And for my part, in&s;tead of attracting a Swain,</L>
<L>I only &s;hall think, as they heartily vex me,</L>
<L>Of e&s;caping from tho&s;e who already perplex me.</L>

<L>O make your&s;elf ea&s;y, I pray, on that head;</L>
<L>In the deepe&s;t di&s;grace the poor Poet is fled,</L>
<L>And I tru&s;t that the Critic will &s;oon &s;hare his fate.</L>
<L>Come with me&mdash;I've a mo&s;t curious tale to relate.</L>

<L>So while in the grove I was coolly projecting</L>
<L>New plans for the temple the Knight is erecting,</L>
<L>Our Poet, addicted to amorous &s;in,</L>
<L>Grew a little too fond of the Ladies within:</L>
<L>But di&s;covery happen'd his pa&s;&s;ion to damp;</L>
<L>And this is the cau&s;e of his ha&s;te to decamp.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>The old Knight, I believe, &s;uch re&s;entment expre&s;s'd</L>

<L>I think not in your view,</L>

<L>The Girl's very well, but knows nothing of life;</L>

<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>By &s;uch a &s;ad end</L>
<L>I lately have lo&s;t a poor good-humour'd friend.</L>
<L>You remember Jack Dangle at College, no doubt;</L>
<L>He was ju&s;t of your age, and a little more &s;tout;</L>
<L>He, with other young &s;ages, left We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall</L>
<L>To teach Engli&s;h law to the &s;laves of Bengal.</L>
<L>But Jack, in his new chamber-practice at lea&s;t,</L>
<L>Too eagerly follow'd the rules of the Ea&s;t.</L>
<L>A bad cough en&s;u'd, much like yours in its found&mdash;</L>

<L>Good God! I could &s;wear 'twas poor Jack under ground,</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="51">'Tis his tone &s;o exactly, &s;epulchral and hollow!</L>
<L>The &s;y&s;tem he &s;lighted I hope you will follow.</L>
<L>With pains in his brea&s;t he was &s;harply tormented;</L>
<L>But as he at fir&s;t to my guidance con&s;ented,</L>
<L>Some time my &s;trict regimen kept him alive,</L>
<L>Poor Dangle once more was beginning to thrive;</L>
<L>And had he &s;ome months in my plan per&s;ever'd,</L>
<L>On the earth at this moment he might have appear'd;</L>
<L>But chance threw a pretty white girl in his way,</L>
<L>And eager for marriage, fond Jack would not &s;tay:</L>
<L>In vain I conjur'd him to wait half a year,</L>
<L>And &s;hew'd him the danger he ran very clear.</L>
<L>He thought the remains of his cough but a trifle,</L>
<L>And being unable his pa&s;&s;ion to &s;tifle,</L>
<L>He took his fair wife;&mdash;but, alas! the vile cough</L>
<L>Encreas'd every day till it carried him off!</L>
