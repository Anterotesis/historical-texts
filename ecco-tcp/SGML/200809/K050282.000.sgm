<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS not the Meane&s;t of Your Trophies, and of which Mankind &s;peaks in Your Prai&s;e, that both Your Maje&s;ty and Your Ance&s;tors have always been the Champions of Liberty, and the Great Defenders and Protectors of the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>As &s;uch, this whole Nation made their Addre&s;&s;es to You, when they &s;tood in need of a Deliverer from the Encroachments of <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers and Councils.</P>
<P>As &s;uch, they receiv'd Your Maje&s;ty in the room of tho&s;e who cho&s;e rather to De&s;ert them, than to &s;ee them a Free Pro|te&s;tant People; and as &s;uch, they committed to Your Maje&s;ty's Government and Protection the Safety of their Religion and Liberties, which by Your A&s;&s;i&s;tance they had recovered from the Inva&s;ions of <HI>Popery;</HI> and as &s;uch, the Author of the&s;e Sheets humbly Addre&s;&s;es them to Your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion</HI> &s;eems to &s;tretch forth her Hands to Your Maje&s;ty, as to her Con&s;tant Protector; You may view her in a Po&s;ture of Trembling at the Formidable Pro&s;pect of her Encrea&s;ing Enemies, and pointing to the Confederacies that are making again&s;t Her.</P>
<P>Providence, and the Crown You wear, claims Your Maje&s;ty's Concern for the Defence of Religion.</P>
<P>The Peace of <HI>Europe;</HI> the Pre&s;ervation of Trade; the Leagues and Alliances made by Rea&s;ons of State, and for Intere&s;ts of Go|vernment, are Things of Con&s;equence to Kings and Nations; and Your Maje&s;ty is ju&s;tly Concern'd about them.</P>
<P>The Liberties of this Nation, the Property of the Subject, the Encrea&s;e of Manufactures, and the Maintenance of the
<PB REF="3">
Poor, are Things worthy of Debates in the Great Council of the Nation, the <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e are all Antecedent to the Great Relative <HI>Reli|gion;</HI> The&s;e are all but Circum&s;tances to the Great E&s;&s;ential. Circles drawn about the Great Center <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Religion</HI> is, or ought to be, the Great Concern of Kings and Nations; 'Tis for this Kings reign, and Parliaments a&s;&s;emble; Laws are enacted; Trade is carried on; Manufactures are improv'd; Men born, and the World made.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty is a proper Judge, Whether the Danger of Re|ligion in <HI>Europe,</HI> repre&s;ented in the&s;e Sheets, be real, or not; And the Author freely Appeals to Your Maje&s;ty for the Truth of it.</P>
<P>If it be real, God and the Prote&s;tant Religion calls aloud on Your Maje&s;ty and the whole Nation; That laying a&s;ide the Debates of other meaner Affairs, the whole Strength and Soul of the Kingdom &s;hould be applied to, and concern'd about the Care and Pre&s;ervation of that Ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Nor may the Trifles of Property or Prerogative, or any thing el&s;e, of how great Con&s;equence &s;oever, have &s;o much as room in the &s;olemn Con&s;ultations of the Nation, till this Great Affair is &s;ettled, and &s;o &s;ecur'd, that the Power of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Su|per&s;tition</HI> may be incapable to hurt it.</P>
<P>We know that the Almighty Power, from whom all Human Strength is deriv'd, is able to pre&s;erve the <HI>Prote&s;tant Reli|gion;</HI> and that without even Your Maje&s;ty, or Your Parlia|ment's A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But as He always works by Means and In&s;truments, and has always own'd Your Maje&s;ty as an In&s;trument in his Hands for this Glorious Work; &s;o Your Maje&s;ty is de&s;ir'd to reflect, that it wou'd be a Singular Mark of Heaven's Di&s;plea&s;ure, if for want of a Continued Regard to the Security of that Religion which God has entru&s;ted Your Maje&s;ty and this Nation with the Protection of, He &s;hou'd be oblig'd to re a&s;&s;ume the Special and Immediate Care of it Him&s;elf, and take the Work out of our Hands.</P>

<HEAD><PB N="1" REF="4">THE DANGER OF THE Prote&s;tant Religion, FROM THE Pre&s;ent Pro&s;pect of a Religious War in EUROPE.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="body of text">
<P>UPON the Pre&s;ent &s;trange Circum&s;tances of Affairs in <HI>Europe,</HI> Occa&s;ion'd by the Succe&s;&s;ion of a Prince of <HI>France</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> People are mightily concern'd, as their &s;everal Thoughts and Intere&s;ts guide them.</P>
<P>Some, and rea&s;on good, apprehend <HI>England</HI> e&s;peci|ally will come under many Di&s;advantages with re&s;pect to Trade, both in the <HI>Straights</HI> and in <HI>America,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> will always have A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Power to encroach upon Our Trade, have the Preference in their Ports and Markets; and &s;everal other things which I cou'd enlarge on as well as another.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
Some apprehend the Growth of the <HI>French</HI> Power at Sea, his Dangerous Neighbourhood, and his En|croaching Humour; which they give melancholy In|&s;tances of in all the late Wars, Particularly in 1672; which 'tis needle&s;s here to repeat.</P>
<P>But I do not yet find any Concern expre&s;s'd, or any Danger fear'd for the Prote&s;tant Religion: Methinks 'tis too certain a Token the Care of it does not lye next our hearts.</P>
<P>We are allarm'd at every &s;tep made by our Power|ful Neighbours, to the Detriment of our Politick In|tere&s;t: We can &s;ee Dangers to our Trade and Ship|ping at the Di&s;tance of an Age or two; form Leagues, whether right or wrong; commence Treaties, &s;ettle Alliances, and join in Confederacies and Guarranties, for the Pre&s;ervation of the Ballance of Power and Trade.</P>
<P>But &s;ince An&s;wering of Que&s;tions is become the Sub|ject, and &s;ome are pleas'd to An&s;wer them before they are ask'd, give a poor Pamphleteer (or Scribler, or any thing what you plea&s;e to call him) leave to ask one Que&s;tion:</P>
<Q>Where is the League or Alliance in <HI>Europe,</HI> made, or propos'd to be made, for the Pre&s;ervation and De|fence of the Prote&s;tant Religion?</Q>
<P>The Concern of <HI>Religion</HI> is not the meane&s;t Article in the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I am not going to preach a Lecture of Divinity, to &s;how the Value of Religion, and how near the Thoughts of it ought to lye upon our Minds; I wou'd have &s;o much Charity, as to believe every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tant has a ju&s;t Concern for the Pro&s;perity, as well as the Secu|rity of his Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
But po&s;&s;ibly every Man that does value his Religion, may not be &s;en&s;ible of the Danger it is in; and there|fore it may not be ami&s;s to examine the State of the Prote&s;tant Religion, as it now &s;tands in <HI>Europe;</HI> with re&s;pect to its own Power, and the Power of its Ene|mies.</P>
<P>In order to which Scrutiny, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to go back a little to the Original of the pre&s;ent Settlement on which we &s;tand.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant Religion has been profe&s;s'd in almo&s;t all the Dominions of <HI>Europe, Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> excepted, and in mo&s;t of tho&s;e Countries where it has obtain'd on the Inhabitants, it has been E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Leagues and Treaties; which E&s;tabli&s;hments have generally been the Effect of bloody Wars; the Liberty the Prote&s;tants enjoy, has, next to God's Goodne&s;s, been the Purcha&s;e of the Sword, at the Price of the Blood and Trea&s;ure of the People.</P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding the pre&s;ent Condition of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Europe,</HI> I &s;hall Divide them into &s;everal Heads of Nations, and Di&s;cour&s;e of them apart, bringing their &s;hort Hi&s;tory down to the pre&s;ent Time.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>the Princes of Germany:</HI> I place them fir&s;t, becau&s;e they were the fir&s;t that &s;tood up for the Defence of Religion; the Chief of the&s;e are the Kings of <HI>Swe|den</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Brandenburgh, Saxony,</HI> and <HI>Lunenburgh, Hanover, He&s;s Ca&s;&s;el, Zell,</HI> with a Multitude of &s;maller Princes, States, and Cities.</P>
<P>The&s;e maintain'd a long and bloody War with the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, who reduc'd them to low Circum&s;tances; but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Henry</HI> the Se|cond, King of <HI>France,</HI> their Religion receiv'd the fir&s;t Security by Treaty at the Peace of <HI>Pa&s;&s;au,</HI> in the Year 1525, and was afterwards E&s;tabli&s;h'd at the Diet, at
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<HI>Augsburgh Anno</HI> 1555. But in the Year 1618, the War was renew'd again by the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Se|cond, who by the hand of his Old General <HI>Tilly</HI> brought the whole Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>Germany</HI> to the Brink of Ruin.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> were ruin'd at the Battel of <HI>Prague;</HI> the Palatinate given to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> the Circle of the Lower <HI>Saxony</HI> over-run by <HI>Tilly;</HI> and the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who headed the Prote&s;tants, overthrown at the Battel of <HI>Kings-Lutter;</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Mecklenburgh, Po|meren,</HI> Bi&s;hopricks of <HI>Bremen</HI> and <HI>Halber&s;tadt;</HI> the Countries of <HI>Sle&s;ia, Lu&s;atia,</HI> and innumerable others &s;eized, and in the Emperor's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Victo|rious <HI>Tilly</HI> trampled down Religion, with the Fury of a True Son of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants in this Di&s;tre&s;s, as we did lately here in a like Ca&s;e, fly to a Neighbouring Prince for Pro|tection. <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> a King who perhaps never had a Parallel till now, came to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance with only Twelve thou&s;and Men; he Land|ed at <HI>Strael&s;undt;</HI> took all the Dutchies of <HI>Pomeren</HI> and <HI>Mecklenburgh;</HI> &s;ecur'd the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI>'s Coun|try, and enters <HI>Saxony</HI> ju&s;t as <HI>Tilly</HI> had re&s;olv'd to ruin it: <HI>Tilly</HI> meets him with an Army of Forty-four Thou|&s;and Old Soldiers, is overthrown, and his Troops en|tirely ruin'd at the Battel of <HI>Leip&s;ick.</HI>&mdash;God, who&s;e In&s;trument this Gallant King more particularly was, carried him on with &s;uch a Prodigious Cour&s;e of Victory, that in Two years he over-run two Third parts of the Empire; &s;ettled all the Prote&s;tant Princes free and uninterrupted in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Liberties and Religion.</P>
<P>And though he lo&s;t his Life at the famous Battel of <HI>Lutzen,</HI> though his Party was afterwards ba&s;ely for&s;aken by the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who had been twice &s;av'd from
<PB N="5" REF="8">
ruin by them; though the <HI>Swedes</HI> were routed at the Battel of <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> yet they carried the War on with &s;ucce&s;s, 'till they reduc'd the Emperor to demand a Peace, in which the Liberty and Religion of <HI>Germany</HI> was en|tirely &s;etled on the Foot whereon it now &s;tands. This is that famous Treaty of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> made in the Year 1648. and which the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> now complain is broken; by this Peace care was taken, as it &s;hould be in all Leagues, of Religion fir&s;t, and of Pro|perty afterward; the Liberty of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religi|on in <HI>Germany</HI> has its being here, and the King of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> are Guarrantees of the Treaty.</P>
<P>The next general Clau&s;e of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in my account &s;hall be the <HI>Hugonots</HI> of <HI>France;</HI> the&s;e had long &s;truggled with faithle&s;s Kings, had vigorou&s;ly &s;upported them|&s;elves in Eight Civil Wars, under the conduct of <HI>Ga&s;|par Coligni</HI> Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> two Princes of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> and the King of <HI>Navar.</HI></P>
<P>The little Honour the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;hew'd them in their Treaties, and the many Surprizes and Ma&s;&s;acres they met with when under the protection of the Publick Faith, kept the Sword always in their hand, till at la&s;t a Breach between <HI>Hen.</HI> the III. and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> forced that Prince, though he had u&s;ed them very ill before, to throw him&s;elf into their Hands for protection, but being &s;tabb'd by <HI>James Clement</HI> a <HI>Jacobine Fryar,</HI> he fell a Sacrifice to the fury of the <HI>Gui&s;es,</HI> and the Crown devolv'd to the King of <HI>Navar, Henry</HI> the IV. the Head of the Prote&s;tants; which King, though he chang'd his Religion to &s;ecure the Crown, yet &s;o far he took care of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, as to &s;ecure them in the free exerci&s;e of their Religion by the famous <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>Nants;</HI> which how it has been ob&s;erv'd you &s;hall hear pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
The <HI>Dutch</HI> are the next in cour&s;e. The&s;e being Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but having embrac'd the Prote&s;tant Religion, were mo&s;t cruelly treated by the &s;everal Gover|nors &s;ent from the Court of <HI>Madrid;</HI> and as Oppre&s;&s;ion is the fir&s;t Motive to Complaint, they made their frequent Application to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for redre&s;s of their Grie|vances, who an&s;wer'd them as <HI>Rehoboam</HI> did the <HI>I&s;|raelites;</HI> and to make his Words good, &s;ent them <HI>Fer|dinand de Toledo</HI> Duke <HI>D' Alva,</HI> for their Governor; who boa&s;ted that he had Executed Eighteen thou&s;and of them by the hand of the Hangman: Which bloody Proceed|ing, together with the Approach of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inqui&s;i|tion, which he was re&s;olv'd to introduce drove the Peo|ple to the la&s;t Extremity, <HI>viz.</HI> To u&s;e Force in the De|fence of their Natural Rights, Lives and Religion: A Doctrine, which however it may be cried down by our Modern Politicians, has obtain'd upon the whole World, and been more or le&s;s practi&s;ed by all Nations at one time or other.</P>
<P>This War begun by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the famous Predece&s;&s;or of our pre&s;ent King, was carried on with various &s;ucce&s;s; and the Union of the Seven Provinces, which we now call the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> was form'd head|ed and protected by him, 'till he was murther'd by <HI>Bal|thazar Gerrard,</HI> at the procurement of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being &s;hot with two Bullets through the Body, as he was going from Dinner into a Withdrawing Room in his Palace at <HI>Delft.</HI></P>
<P>His Succe&s;&s;or Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> carried on the War with better &s;ucce&s;s for almo&s;t Forty Years, and at la&s;t reduced the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Power &s;o low, that they rather &s;ued for Peace than granted it; which Peace was the known Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> at which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> renounc'd the Sovereign|ty of the United Provinces, and declar'd them a Free State as they are this day.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">
<HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> is another Cla&s;s: The Reformation obtain'd here with le&s;s difficulty, and has continued from the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> without &s;uch Oppo&s;ition and Interruption as it met with abroad.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider the&s;e Four Cla&s;&s;es, under One General Head of Confederacy, as they were engaged in the late War, and we &s;hall pre&s;ently put the whole in the general Ballance, by which the meane&s;t Under&s;tanding may make a judgment what is like to be the Condition of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Two <HI>Nor|thern</HI> Crowns who &s;tood newter excepted, were unani|mou&s;ly confederated in the la&s;t War again&s;t the Power of <HI>France;</HI> and though the Emperor and <HI>Spaniard,</HI> guided by Rea&s;ons of State, join'd with them, 'tis plain to all the World what difficulty the Confederates had, what Blood, what Trea&s;ure was expended to reduce the <HI>French</HI> to the Terms of an Honourable Peace.</P>
<P>If we re examine the Pre&s;ent State of <HI>Europe,</HI> we &s;hall find it, as to the Intere&s;t of Religion, in wor&s;e Circum&s;tances on &s;everal Accounts, than it ever yet was &s;ince the Treaties of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and <HI>We&s;tphalia.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The <HI>Saxon,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and formerly the great Barrier of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion on that &s;ide, is to be counted lo&s;t, their Duke turn'd <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> to get a Crown hardly worth keeping; a clo&s;e Confederate with the Emperor, and dependant upon him for his &s;upport in his new gotten Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Electorate, though it remains <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> is beg|gar'd and exhau&s;ted to maintain their Prince in his New Throne; their Forces ab&s;ent, and which is wor&s;e, al|ready employ'd in an Unju&s;t and Di&s;honourable War with a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Prince, in defiance of Leagues unbro|ken,
<PB N="8" REF="11">
and begun on frivolous pitiful Pretences, and like to be carried on to the ruin of its Author.</P>
<P>The Palatinate, another <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Electorate, by the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Newburgh</HI> is fallen into the hands of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and now in the Power of a Prince, who in confidence of a &s;upport from the Emperor his Brother in Law, is making the fir&s;t open Infractions into the Treaty of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> and per&s;ecutes his <HI>Prote|&s;tant</HI> Subjects with all the rigor and cruelty of a Bigot|ted Prince, who thinks he thereby does God good &s;er|vice, and expects to be well paid for it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> are both remote, and both ab&s;olutely cru&s;h'd under the weight of the Imperial Rigor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who I rank'd in the &s;econd Cla&s;s, and were once a powerful Branch, are quite lo&s;t, &s;unk and gone; either &s;uppre&s;t and driven to <HI>Popery</HI> at home, in defiance of the <HI>Edict of Nants;</HI> or like the Ten Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;catter'd abroad into &s;o many unknown Countreys, that they have lo&s;t them|&s;elves, and in one Age more will be quite &s;unk out of Name and Memory.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> was at the brink of Ruin, and the Founda|tion of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion &s;tood ab&s;olutely under|min'd, the Devil like <HI>Guy Fauks</HI> in the Gunpowder-Polt &s;tanding with the Dark Lanthorn and Match in his hand, till the people took &s;uch a Fright, as put the Na|tion into Fits, of which they could never be cur'd till they had &s;pewed out that Generation of Vipers that would have betrayed their Religion to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and their Country to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>God and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the one as Author, the other as In&s;trument, help'd us out; and I &s;ay without flattery, No Man can have a &s;en&s;e of the Goodne&s;s of the Fir&s;t, and have no Gratitude for the Good-will of
<PB N="9" REF="12">
the La&s;t: And 'tis a ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Wonder to con|&s;ider what &s;ort of Prote&s;tants they are, who have forgot the condition the Prote&s;tant Religion was in at the fir&s;t coming over of our pre&s;ent King; and I would be glad to hear a <HI>Jacobite Prote&s;tant,</HI> if &s;uch a Heterogeneous thing can be, an&s;wer me this Que&s;tion,</P>
<P>How any <HI>Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant,</HI> without mortgaging his Sen|&s;es and Religion, can &s;o much as wi&s;h either that King <HI>James</HI> &s;hould have continued King, or &s;hould return to be King in the &s;ame Temper, Power, and other Cir|cum&s;tances as he was in when his Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty was invited over?</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee &s;everal con&s;iderable Branches of the Pro|te&s;tant Power quite Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swede,</HI> who is one of the mo&s;t Potent Princes in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the part of the World where he is particular|ly u&s;eful, we find his hands full with two faithle&s;s Neighbours, and the flame of a War broke out, which if he be not timely a&s;&s;i&s;ted, may burn him out of <HI>Ger|many.</HI></P>
<P>He is a young King, though by what appears, likely to come behind none of his mo&s;t Glorious Ance|&s;tors; and we have &s;een one Snare laid for him already, which if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> had not untied, would have entangl'd him &s;ufficiently; however, as he is, there can but &s;mall help be obtain'd from him, for the general &s;afety of the Prote&s;tant Religion, who is now &s;uing at the Courts of his Allies for Aid again&s;t the <HI>Pole</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;covite.</HI></P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;h'd the Prote&s;tants of <HI>England</HI> would agree to give &s;uch &s;peedy and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Swede</HI> in this juncture, as may effectually free him from both his A&s;&s;ailants, and put him into a po&s;ture to enter into a general Alliance for the defence of Religion, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">
There are &s;ome other Circum&s;tances which weaken the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; and that is the Temper of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who&s;e King &s;eems di&s;obliged in the highe&s;t man|ner again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Swedes;</HI> and &s;ome have &s;aid, how true I do not determine, not very zealous for the Prote&s;tant Religion&mdash;At lea&s;t, no great mat|ters are to be relied on from him, in ca&s;e &s;uch a War &s;hould break out, unle&s;s you will &s;uppo&s;e him to be fir&s;t thoroughly reconciled to tho&s;e three foremention'd Powers.</P>
<P>Whether the Bu&s;ine&s;s of making the Elector of <HI>Bran|denburgh</HI> King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Hannover</HI> E|lector of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> may not cool the Zeal of tho&s;e Prin|ces, in favour of the Emperor, I &s;hall not deter|mine</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears, that the whole &s;trength of the Prote&s;tant Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> lies now upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>German</HI> Princes in the Circles of <HI>Suabia,</HI> and the Lower <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall next examine the growth and power of <HI>Popery,</HI> which plac'd in a ju&s;t Balance with the re&s;t, will need but a &s;hort Inference to &s;hew any rational man the di&s;|proportion of power that lies between them.</P>
<P>The Popi&s;h Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> are as follow.</P>
<P>The <HI>French;</HI> a whole and entire Monarchy, undivided at home, and free from the incumbrance of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> among them, who had &s;everal times in former Wars ei|ther byas'd their Power in favour of the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> as in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the II. or diverted their De&s;igns by Civil Wars at home, as in the days of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. But the pre&s;ent King of <HI>France</HI> having not broken the <HI>Edict of Nants</HI> only, but aboli&s;hed it, has entirely broke the Body of the <HI>Hugonot</HI> Party, and rooted the very name of it out of his Kingdom; &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> Power be|ing
<PB N="11" REF="14">
altogether <HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> and united under the greate&s;t King <HI>France</HI> ever &s;aw, may ju&s;tly &s;tand foremo&s;t as the Fir&s;t Champion of <HI>Popery</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not enlarge here on the formidable Power of <HI>France,</HI> how he has &s;hown him&s;elf a Match for the grea|te&s;t part of <HI>Europe;</HI> nor upon the zeal and fiery rage of the <HI>French</HI> King again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion; they are things &s;o known in <HI>Europe,</HI> that it is needle&s;s to add any thing to our Apprehen&s;ions that way. Let the <HI>French Prote&s;tants,</HI> who are &s;catter'd over the face of all <HI>Chri|&s;tendom,</HI> be a daily Memorandum to us on that Head.</P>
<P>The Emperor, though he be the fir&s;t Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI> I place next to the <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e I think him &s;ome|thing inferior in power to <HI>France,</HI> at this time e&s;pecially, in the Circum&s;tances we now are treating of, disjointed from the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> part of the Empire.</P>
<P>By the Emperor here we are to under&s;tand the Empe|ror and the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> part of the Empire, which may thus be enumerated.</P>
<P>The Emperor, the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> the Elector Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> a warlike and powerful Prince, and always a Champion of <HI>Popery;</HI> the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> the Electors of <HI>Ments, Trier</HI> and <HI>Cologn,</HI> with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and &s;ome &s;maller <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Prin|ces of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Third Head of Power on the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> &s;ide is the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> under which Name I comprehend all the Prin|ces and Powers of <HI>Italy,</HI> with the <HI>Pope</HI> the Grand Image of Antichri&s;t, the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the Provinces of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>I have purpo&s;ely omitted here the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> and <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> becau&s;e being &s;ome <HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> and lying out of the way, they can neither add nor dimini&s;h in the ca&s;e in hand, but will be hired on both &s;ides, as the Par|ties
<PB N="12" REF="15">
find occa&s;ion for them, or can &s;pare Money to pay for them.</P>
<P>It might &s;eem needle&s;s to make any Remarks here on the Powers on one &s;ide and the other; tho&s;e who are ac|quainted but in a tolerable mea&s;ure with the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Europe,</HI> mu&s;t be convinc'd of this ju&s;t con&s;e|quence, That there is no manner of Compari&s;on to be made.</P>
<P>But &s;ince our Saviour directs tho&s;e who go out to War, to con&s;ider whatever they are able with their Ten Thou|&s;and to encounter the Twenty Thou&s;ands of their Ene|mies, let us recollect the Debate, and con&s;ider the ca&s;e, if it were now coming to a War.</P>
<P>I'll allow that the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> on every &s;ide were firm|ly leagu'd together by their own Intere&s;t for their gene|ral pre&s;ervation; and that all private Divi&s;ions, petty Di&s;putes and Quarrels among them&s;elves were at lea&s;t laid a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent, till the Common Danger was over; which if it be not true, I wi&s;h it were.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o that which I think there is too much rea&s;on to fear, that the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers before men|tioned, whether ally'd or no, &s;hould join in a Common De&s;ign to &s;uppre&s;s their <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Neighbours; and whether jointly or &s;eparately it matters not much, &s;hould fall upon tho&s;e which lay next them.</P>
<P>Having rang'd the Powers of either Party, 'tis nece&s;&s;a|ry to declare the po&s;ture of &s;uch a War, in ca&s;e it &s;hould ever come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>If ever the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould enter into a Confederacy to attack the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> it would be thus.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> would be fallen upon by the <HI>French</HI> on one &s;ide; and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Netherlands being in the hands of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> the Barrier of <HI>Flanders</HI> is lo&s;t, by which means the War is brought home to their own Doors,
<PB N="13" REF="16">
and the fir&s;t Shock mu&s;t fall on their Frontiers, where they mu&s;t defend them&s;elves again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the &s;ide of <HI>Sluice, Bergen Op Zoom, Breda,</HI> and the <HI>Bo&s;ch,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> on the <HI>Maes</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> from <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> to <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and again&s;t the <HI>Mun&s;terians</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Groninghen</HI> to the &s;ide of <HI>Embden</HI> and the Sea.</P>
<P>Nor wou'd their Fleet &s;tand them in any &s;tead, the War wou'd be all by Land: They mu&s;t maintain Three Royal Armies at lea&s;t to keep the Field, or their Ene|mies will break into their Country, and make them maintain both Armies in a place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> are not in&s;en&s;ible of the Truth of this, as may be plainly prov'd by the Care and va&s;t Expence they have been at to protect <HI>Flanders</HI> in all the la&s;t War; from which all the Benefit they have propos'd to them&s;elves, has been the Maintaining a good Barrier between Them and <HI>France,</HI> and thereby keeping the War from their own Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>German</HI> War will in all probability be on the Banks of the <HI>Elb,</HI> the <HI>Oder,</HI> and the <HI>Main:</HI> The Pro|te&s;tant Countries lye from the <HI>Oder</HI> to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and contain the whole Circles of the Upper and the Lower <HI>Saxony,</HI> and a &s;mall part of the Circles of <HI>We&s;tphalia, Franconia,</HI> and <HI>Suabia.</HI></P>
<P>But the Weight of the War on the Prote&s;tants mu&s;t lye on the <HI>Elb</HI> and the <HI>Main:</HI> On the <HI>Elb</HI> the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> will have their main Forces to Attack the Dukes of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lunenburg;</HI> and on the <HI>Main,</HI> the <HI>He&s;&s;ian,</HI> with the Princes of the Lower <HI>Saxony,</HI> will be Attackt by the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the Prince <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the Electors of <HI>Treves, Mentz,</HI> and <HI>Cologn;</HI> backt &s;till by the Em|peror, the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">
The <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> will again have the Emperor on their backs upon the <HI>Oder,</HI> with the <HI>Poles</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>Here, if ever &s;uch a Time &s;hall happen, the War will be very bloody; and were not the <HI>French</HI> to join on the Banks of the <HI>Main,</HI> perhaps the Emperor might have his hands full: But a <HI>French</HI> Army to fall in among the Princes of the Circles of <HI>Franconia</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|phalia,</HI> is an Article not to be con&s;ider'd without giving up the Cau&s;e; <HI>Nothing but the Angel of God in the Army of</HI> Senacherib, <HI>can prevent their Total De&s;tru|ction.</HI></P>
<P>I fore&s;ee I &s;hall be attackt by a &s;ort of Men, who are Carrying on De&s;igns of their own, and think every Man aims at them with Arguments like the&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. This is Di&s;covering the Weakne&s;s of the Prote|&s;tants, and leading their Enemies by the hand to de|&s;troy them; betraying our Friends, or expo&s;ing them. Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. This is frighting the World with Chimera's of our own brain, which perhaps may never come to pa&s;s. Dangers as likely, as that the <HI>Turks</HI> may Over-run <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and Extirpate the whole Chri&s;tian Reli|gion: Things to come to pa&s;s, <HI>when the Sky &s;hall fall.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. This is another Shift to bring <HI>England</HI> to a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a Standing-Army, which &s;ome people migh|tily want, to &s;ubject her Liberty to the Arbitrary De|&s;igns of her Enemies.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>For the Fir&s;t I an&s;wer: 'Tis no Di&s;covery at all; and they that will make &s;uch an Objection, mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e the Popi&s;h Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> very dull, if they do not know it as well as we.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
But to make my An&s;wer as &s;hort as the Que&s;tion: They who plea&s;e to inform them&s;elves, will find that in the &s;everal Audiences of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Rome,</HI> his Holine&s;s gave the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;eve|ral Exhortations to re&s;tore Peace to the Church; which we find explain'd at <HI>Paris</HI> in the Speeches made to the King of <HI>France</HI> by the Pope's Nuncio, where he Ex|horts him again to Peace with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that their United Arms might be employ'd <HI>in the Extirpation of Here&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>If I &s;hou'd need Arguments to convince Men, that the <HI>French</HI> know as well as we the Power of the Prote|&s;tant Princes, I cou'd refer them to a late <HI>French</HI> Pamph|let, printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> and Re printed at <HI>Rome,</HI> Entitu|led <HI>La Cru&s;ade,</HI> which laments the Catholick Princes tearing out the Bowels of their Mother the Church; and Exhorts them very pa&s;&s;ionately to employ their Victori|ous Arms to the Extirpation of Here&s;y, and the De|&s;truction of the Enemies of God and the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Improbability of the matter, and its be|ing a Chimera, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Gentlemen, it is no &s;uch Improbable thing nei|ther; for <HI>what has been, may be. Charles</HI> the Fifth un|dertook it &s;ingle-handed again&s;t all the Prote&s;tants in his time; and though the <HI>French</HI> Oppo&s;ed him, he went a great way with the Work; for he reduc'd them to &s;uch low Terms, that had not the Treaty at <HI>Pa&s;&s;au</HI> been obtain'd by the Power of <HI>France,</HI> the Prote&s;tant Religion had been totally &s;uppre&s;s'd in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>French</HI> have ab&s;olutely Effected it up|on one of the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Branches of Prote&s;tants, and thereby &s;hown us a Te&s;t of their Good will to the whole, and given an In&s;tance of the po&s;&s;ibility of the practice.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">
Thirdly, The Prote&s;tant Power was never in weaker Circum&s;tances, nor the Popi&s;h in &s;tronger, if they &s;hou'd but Unite: So that I mu&s;t own, if they do not attempt it, they &s;lip a manife&s;t Opportunity, and mu&s;t be count|ed Fools too; which, by the way, we never found them to be.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to <HI>England,</HI> Standing-Armies, Liberty, Arbi|trary Power, and the like, I mu&s;t crave leave to &s;ay a little. I have no mind to meddle with the Di&s;putes of Politicians, nor know nothing of tho&s;e who have De|&s;igns either way.</P>
<P>They that wou'd En&s;lave our Liberty by Standing-Armies; and they that wou'd leave us naked to our Enemies, or put us out of a Po&s;ture to help our Friends, are equally Enemies to the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>They that wou'd make our Kings out of Love with their Prote&s;tant Subjects, or our People jealous of a Pro|te&s;tant King, are <HI>Beautefeus</HI> of their native Coun|try, and want to &s;ee her again involv'd in Blood, that &s;he may not be able to protect or defend the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>They who wou'd advance the Prerogative of Kings to the Ruin of the Subjects Properties; and They who wou'd &s;ubdue the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchy, and the Ju&s;t Power of the King to the Will and Plea&s;ure of a Party, equally drive at the De&s;truction of Our Con&s;titution, and in that of the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>'Tis not Arbitrary Power which is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, nor Standing-Armies, nor Liberty, nor Property, but the Prote&s;tant Religion. Let <HI>England</HI> have a care &s;he does not take &s;o much Care of her Liberties, as to for|get her Religion: But let us &s;o &s;ee the one done, as not to leave the other undone.</P>
<P>In Reading &s;ome late Pamphlets <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con</HI> about the Danger of Trade, and the Power of our Enemies, I
<PB N="17" REF="20">
ob&s;erve &s;ome are for maintaining Confederacies with Foreign States, and Alliances with Neighbours, and &s;ome are again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Truly, Gentlemen, in the Ca&s;e I am Treating, I Rank all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> into two Cla&s;&s;es only, <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tant:</HI> And we are &s;uppo&s;ing the Popi&s;h Powers &s;hou'd link them&s;elves together in a Confede|racy for the Extirpation of Prote&s;tants, whom they call <HI>Hereticks,</HI> let any Rational Man make the Con&s;equence: What &s;hou'd Prote&s;tants do? Can any human Methods pre&s;erve them, but a &s;trict Union among them&s;elves to join in their mutual Defence?</P>
<P>I know better than to reflect on Parliaments: But if a Parliament of Prote&s;tants forgets the Safety of the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, they neglect the chief Work they a&s;|&s;emble about.</P>
<P>Trade, Liberty, Property, Right and Wrong, Ju&s;tice and Equity, are Things the Convocated A&s;&s;emblies of the People are call'd together about; and they are in the right: but the&s;e are but the &s;ub&s;ervient Preliminaries to pre&s;erve a State or Country in Peace, that they may with their joint Force re&s;olve, and be able to defend and &s;ecure their Religion.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant Religion is the Fundamental of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution; and I hardly ever remember the A&s;&s;embling a Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> but they had their Grand Committee for Religion. What tho&s;e Commit|tees have done of late towards the propagating or &s;e|curing Religion, is be&s;t known to them who can &s;earch the Journals of the Hou&s;e; nor is it proper for me to examine.</P>
<P>I am not for pre&s;cribing Methods how the Prote&s;tant Religion is to be Defended; but I crave leave to give &s;ome Hints from the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of Affairs, to awaken Prote&s;tants, that they may &s;ee their Religion is
<PB N="18" REF="21">
aim'd at by the Popi&s;h Powers of <HI>Europe;</HI> a weak Poli|tician may fore&s;ee, That if ever a Union &s;hou'd happen between the <HI>French, Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> all the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Europe,</HI> except us, are lo&s;t and undone, unle&s;s &s;ome wonderful Revolution, which a wi&s;er Head than mine cannot foretel, &s;hou'd happen.</P>
<P>Wherefore I de&s;ire only of Parliaments, of Prote|&s;tants and Kings, that they wou'd conde&s;cend &s;o far, as to take the poor Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prote&s;tant Religion into their Care: <HI>Let it be by &s;uch Ways and Means, as to their Honour in their Great Wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;eem meet.</HI> If it may be done without Standing-Armies or Confedera|cies abroad, with all our hearts: If the Walls of <HI>Jeri|cho</HI> will fall down at the Sounding of Rams-horns, never let us rai&s;e Batteries, or plant Cannon again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Here is no room to talk of Pretences and Shooing-horns for Standing-Armies; God and the Prote&s;tant Religion calls upon all the Profe&s;&s;ors of it in <HI>Europe</HI> to look to them&s;elves, and to &s;tand up <HI>for the City of our God:</HI> And if the Enemies of the Church of Chri&s;t &s;ay, <HI>A Con|federacy,</HI> they are to give the Cur&s;e of God on all tho&s;e who &s;hall refu&s;e <HI>to help the Lord again&s;t the Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e a War of Religion will require us to lay a&s;ide all our ill-natur'd Animo&s;ities: Here is no Foreign|ers, no Refugees, no <HI>Dutch</HI> Men; 'Tis a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> is the General Term; as in Two Armies that are to Engage, where One Party wears a White, and the Other a Green Signal in their Hats, they do not enquire what Nation any Man is of; but if any of the White Party meets a Souldier with the Green in his Hat, <HI>Down with him;</HI> if they &s;ee another with the White in his Hat in Di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Relieve him</HI> is <HI>the word.</HI></P>
<P>In this Cau&s;e of Religion, Gentlemen, if the <HI>Swede,</HI> or the <HI>Dane,</HI> or the mo&s;t remote Nation be Attackt, we are only to examine if the Prote&s;tant Religion be his Sig|nal;
<PB N="19" REF="22">
if &s;o, we ought to help and relieve them, let them be what Nation or People &s;oever; and let Natural and Political Aver&s;ions be never &s;o great, if our Enemy's hou&s;e be on fire, we'll endeavour to put it out, if it be for nothing el&s;e but for fear it &s;hou'd burn our own: When the Prote&s;tants in any part of <HI>Europe</HI> are Attackt, <HI>Proximus Ardet;</HI> Let us con&s;ider, if ever the Fire of Po|pery con&s;umes the Prote&s;tant Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Flame will certainly catch hold of us in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Some Gentlemen have &s;aid lately, That Confederacies and Alliances never are of any Advantage to <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e we live by our &s;elves in an I&s;land, and have a good Fleet.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not examine whether what they &s;ay will hold in Matters of Policy and Government: But, Gentlemen, let me tell you, If the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation &s;hou'd &s;ee the Re&s;t of the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Europe</HI> de&s;troy'd, without helping them, even with all her Forces, upon this principle, That we are &s;afe, having a good Fleet; &s;hou'd we not expect, be&s;ides all the other fatal ill Con&s;equences, our Saviour &s;hou'd rank us among tho&s;e, who <HI>when he was an hungry, gave him no meat;</HI> or, when he was in Di&s;tre&s;s, gave him no help, <HI>which is all one.</HI></P>
<P>But becau&s;e I wou'd a little pre&s;cribe in the Ca&s;e too, and come to An&s;wering Que&s;tions as well as other peo|ple, I &s;hall enquire, What <HI>England</HI> ought to do?</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, <HI>Principiis ob&s;ta;</HI> prevent the Conjunction of Popi&s;h Powers; cru&s;h the Leagues and Confederacies of Popi&s;h Princes in the beginnings of them, and by all po&s;&s;ible Methods keep them from &s;uch a Union as is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be aim'd at.</P>
<P>This is the way to take away the Cau&s;e, that the Effect may vani&s;h: This takes away all &s;hadow of de&s;igning a Standing-Army; there will be no Occa&s;ion to Fight; divide but the Intere&s;ts of the Popi&s;h Powers of <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="23">
if you can do &s;o, you certainly divide their For|ces.</P>
<P>The late War is a certain Demon&s;tration that they will never unite again&s;t Religion, if they cannot unite their Intere&s;ts. Whoever gives them&s;elves leave to exa|mine, will plainly &s;ee 'tis Intere&s;t, not Religion, governs Princes. I refer for it to the An&s;wer the Emperor gave to King <HI>James</HI> when he demanded A&s;&s;i&s;tance of him again&s;t King <HI>William.</HI> When having told King <HI>James,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if he had rather hearkened to his friendly Re|mon&s;trances, made him by the Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador the Count <HI>de Kaunitz,</HI> than the Deceitful In&s;inuati|ons of the <HI>French;</HI> and if he had put a &s;top by Force to the many Breaches made by the <HI>French</HI> in the Trea|ty at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> of which he was Guarrantee, and had entred into Con&s;ultations with the Imperial Court, and their Confederates, he might have quieted the Minds of his People; and then enumerating the Cru|elties of the <HI>French,</HI> chiefly in the Catholick Coun|tries, exceeding the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves;</Q> the Emperor concludes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Intere&s;t and Safety of the Em|pire is a &s;ufficient Argument to ju&s;tify his not a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing him on account of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Religion again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> having a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> to Encounter with, who on account of Intere&s;t and publick Safety, ought in the fir&s;t place to be Oppo&s;ed; and that for mutual Pre&s;ervation and Defence he mu&s;t be ju&s;tified in ta|king Mea&s;ures, with all tho&s;e, meaning the <HI>Prote|&s;tants,</HI> who are concern'd in the &s;ame De&s;ign.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee when joint Intere&s;t and Pre&s;ervation is the Ca&s;e, even the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Princes them&s;elves think it ju&s;tifiable to join in Confederacies, even with <HI>Hereticks,</HI> to &s;uppre&s;s an unju&s;t Inva&s;ion of an encroaching Neigh|bour, though a Catholick.</P>
<P>From whence I draw this &s;hort Con&s;equence,</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24">
That if you keep the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> from Uniting their Intere&s;ts, you, in effect, keep them from Uniting their Forces, and thereby from Invading the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>By preventing the Union of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers, po&s;&s;i|bly &s;ome may &s;uppo&s;e, I mean, that <HI>England</HI> &s;hou'd En|gage in a New War with <HI>France,</HI> to &s;upport the Title of the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> and there comes in the Old Story, a Standing-Army, again by head and &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Why truly, Gentlemen, If ever we pretend to have a War, whether it be with <HI>France,</HI> or any body el&s;e, we mu&s;t certainly have an Army of our own, or &s;ome bodies el&s;e, or we &s;hall make but &s;orry work on't.</P>
<P>Whether tho&s;e Gentlemen wou'd not chu&s;e to &s;ee the Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;unk and lo&s;t, rather than &s;ee an Army rai&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> I cannot conclude? But this I am bold to affirm, That they who had rather run the ri&s;que of the Prote&s;tant Religion, than of their Li|berties, value their Freedom above their Religion, and may very well be &s;u&s;pected to have no Religion at all.</P>
<P>Now the Ri&s;que is not equal neither; for we have had Armies in <HI>England,</HI> and have lo&s;t our Liberties; and we have had Armies in <HI>England,</HI> and have not lo&s;t our Liberties. The Difference lies here, That we had Armies rais'd to En&s;lave us, and they did it; but the la&s;t were rai&s;ed to Defend us; and when that was done, &s;ubmitted the Military to the Civil Power, and left our Liberties entire. I wou'd &s;ay al&s;o, but that I &s;hall of|fend &s;ome folks, That the grand Difference lay in the Kings we had.</P>
<P>Some of our Kings de&s;ign'd our Ruin, and in a great mea&s;ure compleated it by Standing-Armies; but a King that protects the Laws by a principle of Honour and Ju&s;tice, can make Armies that are &s;o fatal to Liberty,
<PB N="22" REF="25">
be the protection of Liberty: So that really it has been our Kings <HI>of pious Memory,</HI> who have been Agents of the People's Ruin; and the late War has &s;hown the World, that Armies may be rais'd and laid down again, if Kings, who Command them, plea&s;e but to &s;ay the word, without ruining a Nation's Liberties.</P>
<P>On the Other hand; If Religion be attackt, it mu&s;t be defended, or 'twill be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus far I have ventur'd to touch the nice Article of an Army in <HI>England;</HI> I hope every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> will agree with me in this, That I had rather &s;ee an Army in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and run the hazard of our Liberties, than &s;ee the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion in <HI>Europe</HI> trodden down for want of our helping to defend it.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are General Points only.</P>
<P>There are a great many Methods to be pre&s;crib'd how the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion may be Defended, and yet no &s;tanding Forces rai&s;ed or maintain'd in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o our Liberties may not be in danger; and the fir&s;t is touch'd at already, prevent the Union of <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers and Intere&s;t, and you'll need no fighting.</P>
<P>Whether this may be done by giving powerful A&s;&s;i|&s;tances to the Emperor, to carry on the Preten&s;ions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> or by appearing in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> with a good Fleet, to confirm the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes in the Intere&s;ts of the Emperor; or by &s;ending over what For|ces we have in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> to make a Diver|&s;ion, in Conjunction with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> or in <HI>Flanders,</HI> or by what other Ways or Means it may be done, with or without an Army, 'tis all one, &s;o it be but done, that the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion may be protected, and the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> prevented from Overturning us with a General de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But that no Man may have any &s;hadow to &s;u&s;pect me guilty of a De&s;ign to Argue for a Standing-Army,
<PB N="23" REF="26">
which is <HI>the great Bugbear of the Times,</HI> or at lea&s;t made the <HI>Watch-word of a Party</HI> that wou'd be thought to be more Zealous for our Liberty than any body el&s;e; I'll put it on another point: Our Neighbours may be &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted by our Money, as never to want our Men; and &s;o, Gentlemen, you will be try'd whether 'tis your Liberty or your Money that &s;o much &s;tir has been made about; and if we &s;hall let our Prote&s;tant Neighbours &s;ink, rather than part with our Money to &s;upport them; then the Truth will come out, <HI>That 'tis our Money which was at the bottom of the matter:</HI> For really, Re|ligion and Liberty are &s;o much in the &s;ame Intere&s;t, that 'tis very &s;eldom they Cla&s;h; and he that &s;hall re|fu&s;e to defend his Religion for fear of his Liberty, de|&s;erves to lo&s;e both.</P>
<P>Thus we are got over the point, that our Neighbours may be &s;upported, the Prote&s;tant Religion defended, and the Union of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> prevent|ed, by the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> at this time falling in, to &s;upport the Emperor in his ju&s;t Preten&s;ions on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Domini|ons; and all this without a Standing-Army in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Our Pamphleteers need not di&s;pute about the Con|&s;i&s;tency or Incon&s;i&s;tency of an Army with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, nor whether they that are for or again&s;t it are the be&s;t Subjects: I am &s;ure he that has the greate&s;t Concern for the Prote&s;tant Religion, is mo&s;t likely to be the be&s;t Chri&s;tian; They need not Enter|tain us with their Di&s;cour&s;es of the Danger of our Li|berties and Properties from a Standing-Army, with their little Reflections on the King, by way of Excla|mations again&s;t the &s;ad Con&s;equences which may hap|pen, or may not happen; They need not enter into the Hi&s;tories of Standing-Armies, nor tell us the Won|derful Power of our mo&s;t Formidable Militia: But the Ca&s;e will be alter'd when your <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Brethren call
<PB N="24" REF="27">
for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, if you are afraid to tru&s;t Arms in the hands of your own Countrymen: As <HI>truly</HI> Engli&s;hmen <HI>are dangerous Fellows when in Arms, very &s;urly, and loth to be Disbanded without their Pay.</HI> If therefore we do not think it &s;afe to Tru&s;t our Own people, never let us de&s;ert the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Cau&s;e; for <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Swi&s;&s;er|land</HI> are Inexhau&s;tible Store-hou&s;es of Men: If you will but a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> with Money, 'twill be the &s;ame thing; or if we a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor at this time, it may be the &s;ame thing; for Prevention is all one as Execution, or rather the better of the two.</P>
<P>And this leads us to con&s;ider what, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to better Judgments, &s;eems to me to be the only po&s;&s;ible Means to prevent the Union between the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> and therein the Ruin of the <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;aid already, Our way is to Cru&s;h the Confe|deracies of the <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> and if I do &s;ay, that the Only way to do &s;o, is to prevent the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> de|&s;cending by Will to a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> and that Prince marrying a Daughter of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> I &s;hall believe I am in the Right, till I can hear a better method propos'd.</P>
<P>This Union is much ea&s;ier prevented than it will be di&s;&s;olv'd; Treaties and Alliances may di&s;appoint it. Now whereas Armies and Fleets will hardly defeat it afterward, if the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> Unite, and Conform the Intere&s;ts of their Dominions, they can have no body to bend their Arms again&s;t, but the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> or the <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ee no War can be Rais'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> but what will of Cour&s;e run into a War of Religion: For if the <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI> Princes agree in Intere&s;ts, they can have nothing to quarrel about: And to confirm this, I appeal to a Review of the General Hi&s;tory of <HI>Europe:</HI> In which I offer to make it appear, That &s;etting a&s;ide the Quar|rels
<PB N="25" REF="28">
between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> almo&s;t all the Wars of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> have been Wars of Religion.</P>
<P>And that I may not be thought to &s;peak without|book, I refer the Reader to Examine,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Wars in <HI>Germany,</HI> which, with &s;ome few In|termi&s;&s;ions, la&s;ted from the Year 1508, to 1648, being 140 Years; and begun on pretence of Recovering the Lands of the Church, &s;eque&s;ter'd by the Duke of <HI>Saxo|ny,</HI> and ended by the Conque&s;ts of King <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> and his Generals, at the Treaty of <HI>We&s;tphalia;</HI> in which War, that Great Conquering King lo&s;t his Life, and confirm'd what I am &s;aying in his la&s;t Words, which &s;ome Hi&s;tories tell us were thus: being wounded with a Carabin-&s;hot, and ask'd by a <HI>German</HI> Trooper who he was, An&s;wer'd <HI>I am the King of</HI> Sweden, <HI>who do Seal the Re|ligion and Liberty of the</HI> German <HI>Nation with my Blood.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Wars in the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> begun with the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Inqui&s;ition being Introduc'd into the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and Continued to the Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> with the In|termi&s;&s;ion of Twelve years Truce only, and ended in the Liberty of the Prote&s;tant States, being declar'd free by the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> which War <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain</HI> declar'd a little before his Death, had co&s;t him 564 Millions of Ducats, and the Expedition to In|vade <HI>England</HI> 12 Millions.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Civil Wars of <HI>France,</HI> which began in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, and Eight &s;everal Times engag'd the whole Kingdom; and after that was carried on by <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth again&s;t the <HI>Gui&s;es,</HI> and the League backt by the whole Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> on account of Religion, and never had any long Ce&s;&s;ation till the Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> and the Peace of <HI>Vervins.</HI></P>
<P>I forbear to In&s;tance any more, being unwilling to enter into the Mi&s;eries of our Native Country: but I think the Matter admits of no di&s;pute. That if the Uni|on we &s;peak of &s;hould ever come to pa&s;s, there hardly
<PB N="26" REF="29">
can Commence any War in <HI>Europe</HI> but what mu&s;t be upon the account of Religion. <HI>Europe</HI> has really no|thing el&s;e to quarrel about, or nothing but what Neigh|bours and Guarrantees can oblige one another to de|cide without a Rupture, as lately it was in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Dane</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein.</HI></P>
<P>Religion is the only Di&s;pute left: What bloody Bat|tels have been fought! How has <HI>Europe</HI> been fill'd with Slaughter between tho&s;e powerful Princes, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, for the Kingdom of <HI>Na|ples,</HI> for the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Millan,</HI> and for the Frontiers of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Flanders!</HI></P>
<P>What incredible Expences, and how many heaps of &s;laughter'd Carca&s;&s;es has the Quarrels between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> co&s;t on the Banks of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> and between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in our Age in <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Flanders!</HI> The&s;e have been the Capital Wars of <HI>Europe;</HI> and if the Uni|on between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> be compleated, the Cau&s;e is remov'd, and the Effects cea&s;e of Cour&s;e: There can be no War in this part of the World but what mu&s;t Engage the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> unle&s;s the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> &s;hou'd fall out among them&s;elves; which wou'd be wor&s;e &s;till. Hitherto the Wars between the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers has been the Safety of the <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> if one potent Prince has Attackt them, the Jealou&s;y of another has Defended them. The <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> have from the very beginning been &s;hel|ter'd and protected only by the Animo&s;ities and Jealou&s;ies maintain'd between the <HI>French</HI> and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot liken the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Europe</HI> to any thing more aptly than to the City of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> between the <HI>Danes</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Lunen|burgh;</HI> or to the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Dominions, between the <HI>Spaniards, French,</HI> and <HI>Italians.</HI></P>
<P>If the City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> had had but one of tho&s;e Neighbours, it had either been <HI>no City at all,</HI> or <HI>their City,</HI> long ago: but the Jealou&s;y and Mi&s;under&s;tanding
<PB N="27" REF="30">
of tho&s;e Princes is the Security of the <HI>Hamburghers.</HI></P>
<P>Either the <HI>French</HI> or the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had long ago An|nexed the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy</HI> to their E&s;tates, had the one been but willing to &s;it &s;till, and let the other Enjoy it.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth had certainly &s;ubdued all the <HI>Prote|&s;tants</HI> in the Empire, if <HI>Henry</HI> the Second of <HI>France</HI> had not upheld them; and that not from any kindne&s;s he had to them, but that he was not Ea&s;y to &s;ee the Em|peror be &s;o Great. Afterward the Emperor him&s;elf en|courag'd the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;uffer'd Men to be Levied in the Empire for the King of <HI>Navarr;</HI> le&s;t he being quite &s;uppre&s;s'd, the <HI>French</HI> &s;hou'd be at lei&s;ure to quarrel with him. Thus the Jealou&s;ies between the Powers of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> have been the Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Since that, in our Memory, the Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> both <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> Declar'd War again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and Form'd the Tripple Alliance only to &s;ave the Prote&s;tant States of <HI>Holland</HI> from falling into the hands of the French <HI>Anno</HI> 1672, when our Prote&s;tant King, <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, of pious Memory, did his Utmo&s;t to Overthrow them, and &s;ubject them to an Ab&s;olute <HI>French</HI> Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>If any man &s;hall be &s;o weak as to Reply in the Lan|guage of &s;ome late Pamphlets, What's all this to us? What does the Union of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> or of any body el&s;e, &s;ignify to us? I crave leave to An&s;wer &s;uch a Que&s;tion, by &s;aying as our Saviour to the <HI>Phari&s;ees, And I al&s;o will ask you a Que&s;tion:</HI></P>
<P><HI>What &s;ignifies the Prote&s;tant Religion to us?</HI> And if they will undertake to An&s;wer the La&s;t, I will promi&s;e to An&s;wer the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I might go on here to give In&s;tances how near the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Religion has been to be &s;uppre&s;s'd in <HI>England,</HI> and what a ju&s;t Concern other Nations have always had for its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But &s;etting that a&s;ide, for we do not love to hear of it: I de&s;ire only to re-mind the Reader, That the Par|liaments
<PB N="28" REF="31">
of <HI>England,</HI> together with our <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Kings and Queens, have always expre&s;s'd deep Re&s;entments at the Danger of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion, and of our <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Neighbours; and have always thought it became them by Treaties and Interce&s;&s;ions to procure their Re|po&s;e, or by Money and Forces to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And after giving &s;ome In&s;tances, I &s;hall examine the Rea&s;ons of it, and &s;ee if the &s;ame Rea&s;ons do not now call on us for the &s;ame Proceedings.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> after &s;he had provided for the Safety of Religion at home; her next Care was to a&s;&s;i&s;t her <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Neighbours. What va&s;t Sums of Money did &s;he Give and Lend; what Number of Troops did &s;he Rai&s;e to &s;upport the <HI>Hugonots</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and Prince <HI>Mau|rice</HI> in the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> Even before &s;he had any actual War with the <HI>Spaniard?</HI> The Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times rec|kon up above 80000 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers, including Volun|teers, that fought during that long War, in the Quarrel of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion in the <HI>Low-Countries;</HI> where they behav'd them&s;elves &s;o well, and gain'd &s;uch Reputation, that 40 Years afterwards, when our Civil Wars broke out in <HI>England,</HI> an Old <HI>Low-Country</HI> Soldier was always counted a Man of Value.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> &s;ent at &s;everal times 40000 Men to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>French Hugonots</HI> under <HI>Hen.</HI> the 4th.</P>
<P>After the Death of Queen <HI>Elezabeth,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, though he had not Courage enough to break with <HI>Spain</HI> in the ju&s;t Quarrel of the <HI>Pal&s;grave,</HI> King of <HI>Bohe|mia;</HI> yet we find the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation and Parliament all along Re&s;enting, not &s;o much the Injury of that Family, as the Ruin of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of the <HI>Palatinate;</HI> and &s;e|veral Bodies of Men were &s;ent over to Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> to defend it; though by the Craft of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> King was Cajol'd into an ea&s;y De&s;erting the Cau&s;e both of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion and his own Family.</P>
<P>In the Reign of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, what va&s;t Sums
<PB N="29" REF="32">
of Money were given by the Parliament to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Pro|te&s;tants</HI> of <HI>Rochelle;</HI> which tho' by the Mi&s; application of the Court and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> did them little &s;ervice; yet 'tis plain by it, that the Parliament knew the Protection of our <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Neighbours, was a Work the whole Nation had a ju&s;t Concern in, both on Civil as well as Religious Accounts.</P>
<P>After this you have 6000 Men at a time twice rai&s;ed, be&s;ides Recruits, and &s;ent by Sea as far as <HI>Pomerania</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the Quarrel of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1679, the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> addre&s;s'd K. <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d to Enter into &s;uch Leagues and Allian|ces with our <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Neighbours, as might effectually pre&s;erve <HI>Flanders</HI> from falling into the hands of the <HI>French;</HI> and I refer to the Words of that Addre&s;s, where you have the whole People of <HI>England</HI> Remon&s;trating of what Con&s;equence the pre&s;ervation of <HI>Flanders</HI> was to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; and which &s;tands as an Invincible Argument again&s;t our Modern Politicians, who are for no Leagues nor Confederacies, nor Neghbours, and think <HI>England</HI> a Match for all the World.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;eem to be In&s;tances enough, and 'tis matter of Wonder to me, what &s;ort of Amphibious, Neutral Crea|tures tho&s;e <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are, which &s;hall ask what &s;ignifies the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> abroad to <HI>England?</HI> Suppo&s;ing there was no real Danger of our &s;elves in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us examine, in the next place, the Rea&s;ons which have all along induc'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation to a&s;&s;i&s;t their <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Neighbours: and they are of two &s;orts;</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;ons of Religion, and Rea&s;ons of State:</HI> And I'll be very &s;hort with them both, becau&s;e they are touch'd at already.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;ons of Religion,</HI> are &s;uch as <HI>Charity,</HI> which obliges the Strong to protect and defend the Weak, when they are oppre&s;s'd and injur'd, and unable to defend them|&s;elves: The &s;everal Commands of our Saviour, for the
<PB N="30" REF="33">
Relief of &s;uch as are in Di&s;tre&s;s, Illu&s;trated by the Story of the Good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> the Declaration which our Savi|our has made, That <HI>what&s;oever is done to the lea&s;t of his, is done unto him&s;elf,</HI> and &s;hall be Rewarded accordingly, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;ons of State</HI> are principally the Great Doctrine of Self-pre&s;ervation, which branches it &s;elf in &s;uch Methods as the&s;e:<LIST>
<ITEM>Keeping Danger at a di&s;tance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Keeping a good Barrier between Our &s;elves and pow|erful Neighbours, that you may not be forced to a De|fen&s;ive War.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Preventing the Union of Neighbours of different In|tere&s;ts from Our &s;elves.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> Pre&s;erving publick Peace; which is be&s;t done <LIST>
<ITEM>By &s;trong Alliances and Guarrantees:</ITEM>
<ITEM>By keeping an Equality of Parties, or a General Balance of Power:</ITEM>
<ITEM>And by being always in &s;uch a po&s;ture of Defence, as to make it dangerous for a Neighbour to break with you.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e, with many others, are the Rea&s;ons why our Princes, and our Parliaments too, have always thought it both their Duty and their Intere&s;t to protect and de|fend the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion abroad, and have always been very tender of the Injuries done them by their <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI> Adver&s;aries, and re&s;ented them accordingly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give one In&s;tance more: <HI>I hope the Rea&s;on of State will not be lik'd the wor&s;e for the State&s;man;</HI> and that was <HI>Oliver Cromwell;</HI> who being &s;ollicited by the Prote&s;tant <HI>Vaudois</HI> in <HI>Savoy,</HI> u&s;ed all his Intere&s;t to mediate with the Duke their Prince for a Relaxation of their Mi&s;eries; and in his Letters both to the Duke and the <HI>French</HI> King, af|ter a great deal of fruitle&s;s Interce&s;&s;ion, threatens to turn all the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> out of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;eize their Effects, if &s;ome &s;peedy Regard be not had to the Afflictions of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prote&s;tants. I refer the
<PB N="31" REF="34">
Reader for the Particulars, to the <HI>Latin</HI> Copies of the Let|ters wrote on that Subject by his Secretary of Foreign Di&s;|patches, the Learned <HI>Milton;</HI> in which there are Rea&s;ons given why the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation &s;hou'd think them&s;elves oblig'd to concern them&s;elves in the Sufferings of the <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI></P>
<P>But methinks it &s;hou'd be needle&s;s to go any farther than the Journals of our own Parliaments &s;ince the Re|&s;toration; where it will evidently appear, that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliaments have always had a deep Re&s;entment at the Growth of <HI>Popery,</HI> and the Danger of the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion; and there is, no doubt, but an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament will ever maintain the &s;ame Sentiments.</P>
<P>The Growth of <HI>Popery</HI> is certainly dangerous to the Prote&s;tant Religion; They are the two Buckets in the Well, the two Scales on the Beam of Power; if One comes up, the Other mu&s;t go down; if you add to the Weight of One, it will lift the Other out of its place.</P>
<P>Let all tho&s;e who wou'd &s;tand Neuter in this Cau&s;e of Religion, remember that God Almighty has declar'd again&s;t &s;uch as are lukewarm Chri&s;tians: There is no Neuter Gender in Religion. In the Cau&s;e of Religion, They who are not for him, are again&s;t him; the Defence of the Prote&s;tant Religion calls upon all Men who have any Value for it, to appear in the time of its Danger: De|fend Religion and Politick Intere&s;ts will be ea&s;ily &s;ecur'd: <HI>&agrave; jove Principium, God and your Country;</HI> but fir&s;t God, and then your Country.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, though I am no Prophet, nor the Son of a Prophet, I think a man with but a &s;mall Talent of forca&s;t, may be able to foretel, That if we are wanting to God in the due and vigorous defence of his Church and Wor|&s;hip, which is in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion; his Providence has &s;o wi&s;ely di&s;po&s;ed the matter, and made our Liberty &s;o dependant on, and relative to our Religi|on, that it is morally impo&s;&s;ible Liberty in <HI>England</HI> can be any longer liv'd than Religion. <HI>Popery</HI> and Slavery
<PB N="32" REF="35">
are like Sin and Death, direct Con&s;equences of one ano|ther; and whenever we think fit to admit the fir&s;t, any body may promi&s;e us the la&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot conclude this matter without remembring two Exceptions that lie again&s;t any body's pleading the Cau&s;e of Religion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That in all the ill practices of the World, the Re|volutions of States, Rebellions of Subjects, and Tyranny of Princes, <HI>Religion is the Mask</HI> to hide the Deformity of the Mon&s;ter conceal'd.</P>
<P>Secondly, That <HI>God is Omnipotent,</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion is under his immediate protection, that he is able to defend it without means, and again&s;t probability.</P>
<P>To the Fir&s;t, I make an&s;wer in the words of the Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> in the Letter he wrote to the late K. <HI>James,</HI> on his joining with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> our pre&s;ent King, at his coming in to <HI>England;</HI></P>
<Q><P>That were not Religion the mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable Cau&s;e, it would not be made the mo&s;t &s;pecious Pretence.</P></Q>
<P>And to this Quotation I &s;hall add; You may as well argue again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Church admini&s;tring the Eu|chari&s;t, becau&s;e <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> was poi|&s;on'd by a Con&s;ecrated Ho&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the Second Argument, 'Tis true God governs the World, and in his governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the World he has ordered that we &s;hould govern our &s;elves by Rea&s;on. God has &s;ubjected even the ways of his Providence to Ratio|nal Methods, and Outward Means agree to it. The great Chain of Cau&s;es and Effects is not interrupted, even by God him&s;elf; if it be, it is on Extraordinary Occa&s;ions, which we call Miracles.</P>
<P>Now according to the Nature of Cau&s;es and Con&s;e|quences, the Argument for our care of Religion mu&s;t be good; as to tho&s;e people who look for Miracles, I have nothing to &s;ay to them.</P>
