<P>Why a new kind of a London Eng|li&s;h, that's no more like our Iri&s;h Engli&s;h, than a coxcomb' fine gilded chariot like a Gla&s;&s;manogue noddy.&mdash;Why what name do you think &s;he went by when &s;he was in England?</P>

<SP>

<P>Ay, ridiculous indeed! to change her name&mdash;was there ever &s;uch impertinence? But do you know, brother, among the re&s;t of your &s;i&s;ter's whims and madne&s;&s;es, that &s;he is turned a great politician too concerning my name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But, prithee, by what means?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you mu&s;t know, we are to have an election &s;hortly for the county that I live in, which young Lord Turnabout wants to carry for one of his own gang; and as the election in a great mea&s;ure depends upon my intere&s;t, the young fox, knowing the conceit and vanity of my wife, has taken her by her favou|rite &s;oible, and tickled it up, by telling her that if I direct my intere&s;t properly, it would not be difficult to procure me a title. Now, &s;ir, this piece of flattery has &s;tirred up &s;uch a rage of quality and title in her giddy head, that I cannot re&s;t night or day for her importunity&mdash;in &s;hort, &s;he would have me de&s;ert my friends, and &s;ell my&s;elf, my honour, and my country, as &s;everal others have done before me, merely for a title, only that &s;he may take place of a parcel of fooli&s;h idle women, and &s;ink the antient name of Dogherty in the up&s;tart title of Lady Thingum, my Lady Fiddle F addle, or &s;ome &s;uch ridiculous non&s;en&s;e.</P>
</SP>

<P>But, &s;ir, pray pau&s;e a little upon this bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;my &s;i&s;ter's vanity, I grant you, may be ridiculous&mdash;but though you de&s;pi&s;e titles and oftentation, yet, as your intere&s;t can certainly make the member, were I in your circum&s;tances, I would have a voice in the &s;enate of my

<P>Ogh, I have been among them al|ready, and I know them all very well. What &s;ignifies my &s;itting among hundreds of people with my &s;ingle opinion all alone. When I was there before I was &s;tigmatized as a &s;ingular blockhead, an impracticable fellow, only becau&s;e I would not con&s;ent to &s;it like an image, and when the ma&s;ter of the puppets pulled the &s;tring of my jaw on one &s;ide, to &s;ay aye, and on t'other &s;ide, to &s;ay no, and to leap over a &s;tick back|wards and forwards, ju&s;t as the faction of party and jobbers, and leaders, and political adventu|rers directed&mdash;ah, brother, brother, I have done with them all&mdash;oh, I have done with them all.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I will&mdash;I was patriot mad I own, like a great many other fools in this di&s;|tracted country&mdash;&s;ir, I was &s;o mad that I hated the very name of a courtier as much as an illite|rate lay-&s;waddling methodi&s;t does that of a regular clergyman. But I am cured of that folly; for now I find that a courtier is ju&s;t as hone&s;t a man as a patriot&mdash;my dear, they are both made of the &s;ame &s;tuff; ah, I have at la&s;t found out what &s;ort of an animal a patriot is.</P>

looking up at, and &s;taring, and di&s;tracting them|&s;elves with the integrity of its vici&s;&s;itudes&mdash;to-day it is blown by the rough, rattling, tempe&s;t of party; next day by the trade-wind of fly, &s;ubtle, veering faction; then by the headlong hurricane of the people's hot foggy breath; huzza boys, down with the courtier, up with the patriot, 'till at la&s;t the &s;mooth, &s;oft, gentle warm breeze of intere&s;t blows upon it, and from that moment it ru&s;ts to a point, and never &s;tirs after&mdash;&s;o there is your puff patriot for you&mdash;ogh, to the devil I pitch them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! I am glad to find, brother, that you are come to that way of thinking at la&s;t, and I wi&s;h you had had the &s;ame notions years ago, it would have &s;aved you many thou|&s;ands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, and that it would&mdash;however experience is an excellent tutor, and as you are a young man, and ju&s;t coming into the world, mine may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to you; take this judgment from me then, and remember that an hone&s;t quiet country gentleman who out of policy and humanity e&s;tabli&s;hes manufactories, or that contrives employment for the idle and the indu&s;trious, or that makes but a blade of corn grow where there was none before, is of more u&s;e to this poor country than all the cour|tiers, and patriots, and politicians, and prodigals that are unhanged;&mdash;&s;o there let us leave them and return to my wife's bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>You mu&s;t know, brother, there is an Engli&s;h coxcomb in this town ju&s;t arrived among us, who thinks every woman that &s;ees him is in love with him, and this &s;park, like another Paris of Troy, has taken it into his head to make a Helen of my wife, and a poor cuckoldy Menelaus of me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! Pray who is the &s;park?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the name of this cuckold|maker is Mu&s;hroom, but from his conceit and impertinence, the women and jokers of this town have dignified him with the title of Count Mu&s;hroom. Sir, he is the &s;on of a pawn-broker in London, who having a mind to make a gentleman of his &s;on, &s;ent him to the univer&s;ity
<PB N="13" REF="12">
of Oxford; where, by mixing in the follies and vices of irregular youth, he got into a mo&s;t &s;anguine friend&s;hip with young Lord Old-Ca&s;tle, who you know has a large e&s;tate in this country, and of who&s;e ance&s;tors mine have held long and profitable lea&s;es, which are now near ex|piring&mdash;in &s;hort, &s;ir, this &s;ame Count Mu&s;hroom and my Lord became the Pylades and Ore&s;tes of the age, and &s;o very fond was my Lord of him, that out of &s;heer friend&s;hip to the Count, he got his &s;i&s;ter with child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! that was friendly indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, it was what you may call modern friend&s;hip, ta&s;te, and bun tun; and my Lord being a man of gratitude, in return made him his agent in this country, and &s;ent him over to &s;ettle his affairs here. And the Count and I being in treaty to renew the lea&s;es with my Lord, and we not being able to agree upon the terms, the coxcomb &s;ends my wife a warm billedoux, in which he very gallantly tells her, that &s;he &s;hall decide the difference between us, and &s;ettle the lea&s;es at her own price, only upon the trifling condition that he may be permitted now and then to be the occa&s;ional lord of her lady&s;hip's matrimonial manor.</P>
