<P>THE following Poem does not pa&s;s any judgment upon the Pictures that are now exhibited in the Gallery; but attempts to point out new &s;ubjects for future exhibitions: And, in the delineation of new &s;ubjects, attention is paid to the principle laid down by our great Painter, (in his notes to the tran&s;lation of Fre&s;|noy by Mr. MASON) <Q>That palpable &s;ituation is preferable to curious &s;entiment, as the Pain|ter &s;peaks to the eye.</Q></P>
<P>The encouragement that is now &s;o liberally extended to Painting, will &s;oon decide the que&s;|tion,
<PB REF="7">Whether or no our Painters are adequate to the ta&s;k they are called upon to perform. MACK|LIN'S exhibition is al&s;o a &s;plendid and arduous undertaking: It is another Lyceum, in which riyal Arti&s;ts may contend for fame and emolu|ment.</P>
