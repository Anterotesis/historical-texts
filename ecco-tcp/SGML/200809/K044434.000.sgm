<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE immortal Author of Hudibras af|firms, the harde&s;t ta&s;k in the world is to write a play; it is, therefore, no wonder that writers of plays are prone to regard their la|bours with fondne&s;s, even to partiality; or that they &s;hould perceive with regret the light e&s;teem in which a part of the literary world have lately affected to hold them. Works of rudi|ment, of di&s;qui&s;ition, nay, even, of mere compilation, are often treated by critici&s;m with a re&s;pect which a comedy, or tragedy, where wit, invention, genius, and all the highe&s;t faculties of the mind have, or ought to have, been employed, &s;eldom meets. The theatre, however it may be deba&s;ed by the nightly intru&s;ion of unhappy and improper per&s;ons, has a mo&s;t powerful and good in|fluence on morals, which increa&s;es with in|du&s;try, and as the means of gaining admi&s;&s;ion among the lower cla&s;s increa&s;e. Much time is there &s;pent to the be&s;t, the noble&s;t, of pur|po&s;es; the body's fatigues are forgotten, the mind is beguiled of its cares, the &s;ad heart is made merry, fictitious &s;orrow obliterates real, and the &s;oul, imbibing virtuous and heroic principles, is rou&s;ed and impelled to actions that honour not only individuals but nations, and give a dignity to human nature. Tho&s;e who can doubt this are to be pitied. And it is piteous, mo&s;t piteous, that, not only the learned, but, the political world &s;hould treat the &s;tage with neglect; nay, with contempt:
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
that they do not combine, and employ the high powers they po&s;&s;e&s;s to the encouragement and perfection of an art which, being, in its own nature, &s;o delightful, &s;o fa&s;cinating, is capable of contributing, &s;o infinitely, to the happine&s;s, as well as to the plea&s;ure, of man|kind.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas have long, and often, occurred to my mind, where they have acted with in|crea&s;ing force. If I have written a comedy which, perfectly moral in its tendency, and counteracting a fa&s;hionable vice that is in danger of becoming a vulgar one, has charms &s;ufficient to attract &s;pectators, I am of opinion I have done my country an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. That &s;ome who read this may call me vain or pre&s;umptuous is, to me, totally indifferent. The theatre is a &s;ubject of &s;uch con&s;equence to virtue, happine&s;s, and man, that I cannot forbear &s;peaking of it with a &s;en&s;e of feeling which, I fear, I cannot impart.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now undertake a ta&s;k of a very dif|ferent and painful nature; the cau&s;e of my undertaking it &s;hall be given, when I have told my &s;tory.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1785, I wrote the Opera of the Choleric Fathers, and the Comedy of Seduction. They were both put into the hands of Mr. Harris, on certain conditions; the &s;ub&s;tance of which was that, if, after read|ing, he &s;hould approve the pieces, they were both to be played, during the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, the fir&s;t in November, and the latter in January,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
or the beginning of February, 1786. They were read by Mr. Harris, and both accepted, on the&s;e conditions; and &s;o preci&s;e, &s;o per|fectly explained, were they that they were re|duced to writing. However, certain objec|tions ari&s;ing, on the part of Mr. Harris, con|cerning benefit nights (not the time of perform|ing the pieces, for that remained determined) I, my&s;elf, tore the written agreement; &s;aying, I thought it improbable men, who meant ho|ne&s;tly and honourably, &s;hould differ in trifles; and that each other's word was &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>When Mr. Harris had read Seduction, though he objected to parts, he was, yet, &s;o well plea&s;ed with the whole, that he &s;aid, with evident, and peculiar, &s;atisfaction, I had given the theatre a comedy which, he thought, would do it no harm.</P>
<P>Having made his objections, alterations were agreed on, and the comedy taken back. Further to prove how fully the word of Mr. Harris was engaged, how perfectly he under|&s;tood him&s;elf pledged to abide by his agree|ment, while the Opera of the Choleric Fathers was preparing for repre&s;entation, Mr. Harris &s;ent to me, to make a new propo&s;al, which, according to him, would highly benefit the theatre. This was that, in&s;tead of January, I &s;hould &s;uffer the comedy to be brought out before Chri&s;tmas, becau&s;e he had a new panto|mime (Omai) that would, in all probability, be greatly beneficial to the theatre, after Chri&s;tmas, and that his &s;ea&s;on would then
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
be filled up, and, probably, exceedingly pro|ductive. That my intere&s;t might not &s;uffer by this arrangement, he promi&s;ed, in com|pen&s;ation, to &s;uffer the new pantomime to be played for my third benefit, and, if the comedy ran a certain number of nights, for my fourth. When he made this propo&s;ition I de&s;ired time to con&s;ider, and con&s;ult my friends; and, at la&s;t, from a &s;incere wi&s;h to oblige Mr. Harris, and &s;erve the theatre, acquie&s;ced. This pro|ject, however, was deranged; not by me, or Mr. Harris; but by an event highly vexatious to both, and which I &s;hall not relate now; perhaps never.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the play had received &s;ome alterations, and the in&s;ertion of a cha|racter &s;o atrocious, yet &s;o frequent, in this town, as to make, in the opinion of Mr. Harris, the repre&s;entation of it dangerous. Accordingly, this was to be expunged, &s;till further alterations were undertaken, and the comedy, a third time, delivered, as it is at pre|&s;ent played, about the beginning of December, 1785. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to remark that, before this, the Choleric Fathers had been performed, and did not take that run which Mr. Harris expected, and I had hoped; and that, knowing the changeable di&s;po&s;ition of Mr. Harris, I cautioned him again&s;t &s;uffering this mediocrity of &s;ucce&s;s to influence, and prejudice, his mind again&s;t the comedy. He a&s;&s;ured me it &s;hould not.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;tate that, &s;o &s;elf-denying
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
was I, and de&s;irous of promoting the welfare of the theatre, when Mr. Harris informed me, by Mr. Lewis, he had no further hopes from the Opera, which had then been played &s;even nights, and that he would allow me the eighth in&s;tead of the ninth night, but adding he doubted whether I &s;hould clear expences; I, though there was no probability of lo&s;s, and, certainly, &s;ome of gain, gave up my third night to the theatre; telling Mr. Lewis I would not deprive Mr. Harris of a night, un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Comedy remained with Mr. Harris, who, I was told, was gone out of town, till the beginning of January, without my re|ceiving any information of its being preparing for rehear&s;al. I began to be alarmed; and, unable to obtain an interview, or even di&s;|cover where Mr. Harris was, I wrote a letter to him, expre&s;&s;ive of the&s;e alarms. I need not de&s;cribe what my feelings were, a few days after, on receiving the comedy back, with a letter from Mr. Harris, in which the&s;e feelings were indeed little re&s;pected, inform|ing me it could not &s;ucceed. The manner of &s;ending it back was, almo&s;t, as extraordinary as the act. It was brought, loo&s;ely tied up with packthread, in a bit of dirty brown pa|per, un&s;ealed, by the &s;ervant of Mr. O'Keefe. I mean not to in&s;inuate any po&s;&s;ible di&s;ad|vantage to the character of Mr. O'Keefe: far to the contrary. I have often heard him ho|nourably mentioned. Neither can I &s;ay how
<PB N="x" REF="9">
it came into his hands, or that he knew what it was; but this is no palliation of Mr. Harris's conduct. I returned no an&s;wer; it would have been exceedingly wrong to have tru&s;ted the irritated mind at &s;uch a moment.</P>
<P>I will now give my rea&s;ons for relating this tran&s;action to the world. To pretend I did not feel all the indignation which conduct like this mu&s;t kindle, would be to a&s;&s;ume an apathy contrary to nature; and, even, to virtue. This, however, has worn off: I act coolly, at pre|&s;ent, and from a &s;en&s;e of duty, not revenge. As far as relates to my&s;elf, I would wi&s;h the affair might never more be remembered; but, if men in &s;imilar &s;ituations might act thus <HI>always</HI> with impunity, as they <HI>too often</HI> do, what means could the weak and unprotected find of obtaining redre&s;s; what &s;ecurity in their dealings with a man, who, regardle&s;s of probity, and yielding to the caprice of opi|nion, the dictates of pride, or the narrow motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t, does not &s;cruple to break his word, &s;o pledged, and engagements thus formal?</P>
<P>This narrative will &s;carcely be more di&s;|agreeable to Mr. Harris to read than it has been to me to write: it is not my own cau&s;e I plead, for that was gained in the &s;ucce&s;s of my Comedy; but the cau&s;e of the weak again&s;t the &s;trong; the cau&s;e of hereafter genius again&s;t hereafter inju&s;tice; the cau&s;e of the man, who, endowed with gifts of which Nature her&s;elf is proud, but deprived of every
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
benefit of Fortune, &s;hall devote his days and nights to &s;tudy, and &s;uffer every ab&s;tinence with re&s;ignation, and, even with delight, cheered by the &s;weet hope of being &s;ome time known for what he is. There is a momentary intoxication, a delirium of &s;oul, in this hope, which not the daily privation of plea&s;ures, the di&s;appointments of years, the labours of a life, nor inju&s;tice it&s;elf can counterbalance. It is this godlike &s;en&s;ation which has given the mind an impetus, and made it produce works &s;o various, and &s;o va&s;t, that, glancing at their amplitude and &s;ublimity, it &s;tands confounded at its own powers!</P>
<P>That I may avoid all appearance of min|gling flattery with an appeal to ju&s;tice, I &s;hall forbear de&s;cribing the conduct of the Proprie|tors of Drury-Lane; except &s;aying, they have behaved to me like Gentlemen, and men of honour.</P>
<P>My heart will not, however, &s;uffer me to be equally re&s;erved, and &s;ilent, concerning Mr. King. The moment he was convinced the producing of this Comedy would proba|bly &s;erve, not injure, the Theatre, his zeal and activity, in my cau&s;e, were indefatigable: how very e&s;&s;entially his powers, as an actor, have contributed to its &s;ucce&s;s is too public for me (had I a wi&s;h &s;o &s;elfi&s;h) to conceal. But this is not the fir&s;t debt of gratitude from me to Mr. King; his friend&s;hip, or his philanthropy, while I was &s;truggling into notice, and com|bating with adver&s;e fortune, did me a gene|rous
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
kindne&s;s which never can, nor ever ought to be forgotten.</P>
<P>The Town have beheld, with delight and &s;urpri&s;e, the increa&s;ing excellence of Mi&s;s Farren; and, thinking &s;he had attained per|fection, have been a&s;toni&s;hed, when they &s;aw her next, at their own mi&s;take. In the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance, her exertions, and even the very manner of them, have been as plea&s;ing to me, as they were beneficial to the Comedy. I can only add, &s;he has excelled her&s;elf; and, though that thought be old, it never was more properly applied.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the&s;e, it were inju&s;tice to the re&s;t of the performers not to thank them; both for the di&s;play of talents, the merits of which are well known, and the ardour, I may &s;ay the anxiety, they te&s;tified for my &s;ucce&s;s. Yes, I mo&s;t &s;incerely thank them all; and only forbear to name them, individually, becau&s;e I cannot find expre&s;&s;ions, various and warm enough, to convey my thoughts, without making true and well de&s;erved prai&s;e a&s;&s;ume the form of laboured panegyric.</P>

<L>IN former times&mdash;'tis long ago, I own&mdash;</L>
<L>Man, &s;eated on the haughty hu&s;band's throne,</L>
<L>The wife by &s;uch ab&s;urd re&s;traints enclos'd,</L>
<L>Not one gallant had &s;he&mdash;as he &s;uppos'd:</L>
<L>But, mode&s;t, meek, his jealous doubts appeas'd,</L>
<L>And &s;ooth'd her lord and ma&s;ter&mdash;when &s;he pleas'd.</L>
<L>Then, women led &s;uch exemplary lives,</L>
<L>Daughters, almo&s;t, as humble were&mdash;a&mdash;as wives!</L>
<L>"A &s;avage Salick law the men maintain'd;</L>
<L>"O mon&s;trous! We were &s;laves! and hu&s;band's reign'd."&mdash;</L>

<L>Strange were the&s;e cu&s;toms, ob&s;olete; but we</L>
<L>Con&s;olidate our cu&s;toms&mdash;and, you &s;ee,</L>
<L>Such wi&s;e de&s;igns no oppo&s;ition find:</L>
<L>A fair free trade is good for all mankind.</L>
<L>The lib'ral &s;pirit of our lib'ral beauties</L>

<L>The Cici&s;beo, and the <HI>chere amie,</HI></L>
<L>On the broad ba&s;e of reciprocity,</L>
<L>Are exports now, and imports, duty free.</L>

<L>As for this Lady Morden's motley merit,</L>
<L>With her half-ancient, her half-modern &s;pirit,</L>
