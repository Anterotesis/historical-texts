<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF ILLICIT AT|TEMPTS TO BECOME RICH. THE SLEEP OF A GAMESTER. MORNING MEDITATIONS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE pungency of extreme grief acts as a temporary opiate: for a &s;hort time it lulls the &s;ufferer to in&s;en&s;ibility, and &s;leep; but it is only to recruit him and awaken him to new torments.</P>
<P>When I reached my lodgings, I ap|peared to my&s;elf to have &s;unk into a &s;tate of quie&s;cent re&s;ignation. The die was ca&s;t. My doom was irrevocable; and de|&s;pair it&s;elf &s;eemed to have lo&s;t its charm: the animation, the vigour, of mi&s;ery was gone. I was reduced to an inevitable
<PB N="2" REF="5">
po&s;t-hor&s;e kind of endurance; and had only now to be thankful if I might be permitted to exi&s;t. From an audacious and arrogant confidence in my own &s;trength, I had &s;uddenly yet by percepti|ble gradations declined, though with ex|cruciating pangs at every &s;tep, till I now at la&s;t found my&s;elf in a &s;tate of &s;luggi&s;h and brute imbecility.</P>
<P>Staggering home in this temper, I un|dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, went to bed with &s;tupid compo&s;ure, and felt like a wretch that had been &s;tretched on the rack, and, hav|ing ju&s;t been taken off, was &s;uffered to &s;ink into lifele&s;s languor, becau&s;e he could endure no more. I was mi&s;taken. My &s;leeping &s;en&s;ations &s;oon became tur|bulent, oppre&s;&s;ive, fevered, terrific, yet cumbrous, and impo&s;&s;ible to awake from and e&s;cape.</P>
<P>It was &s;even in the morning, when I returned to my lodging. When I went to bed, my heavine&s;s was &s;o great that I
<PB N="3" REF="6">
&s;eemed as if I could have &s;lept for centu|ries; and, &s;o multifarious and torturing were the images that haunted me, that, the time actually appeared indefinitely protracted: a month, a year, an age: yet it was little more than two hours. The moment &s;truggling nature had ca&s;t off her horrible night-mares, and I had once more &s;tarted into identity, the an|gui&s;h of the pa&s;t day and night again &s;eized me. Pains innumerable, and in|tolerable, ru&s;hed upon me. Each new thought was a new &s;erpent. Mine was the head of Medu&s;a: with this differ|ence; my &s;corpions &s;hed all their venom inward.</P>
<P>Confu&s;ion of mind is the &s;ource of pain: but confu&s;ion is the greate&s;t in minds that are the &s;eldome&s;t &s;ubject to it; and with tho&s;e the pain is proportionably in|ten&s;e. The conflict was too violent to be endured, without an endeavour to get rid of it. I ro&s;e, traver&s;ed my room I
<PB N="4" REF="7">
know not how long, and at la&s;t ru&s;hed into the &s;treet; with a &s;ort of feeling that, when in the open air, the atmo&s;phere of mi&s;ery that enveloped me would be &s;wal|lowed up, and lo&s;t, in the infinite ex|pan&s;e.</P>
<P>The hope was vain: it wrapped me round like a cloak. It was a univer&s;al cau&s;tic, that would not endure to be touched; much le&s;s torn away. I groan|ed. I gna&s;hed my teeth. I griped my hands. I &s;truck my&s;elf violent blows. I ran with fury, in circles, in zigzag, with &s;udden turns and frantic bounds; and, finding my&s;elf on the banks of the Avon, plunged headlong in.</P>
<P>I acted from no plan, or forethought; therefore was far from any intention to drown my&s;elf; and, being in the water, I &s;wam as I had run, like a mad or hunt|ed bull.</P>
<P>That unpremeditated &s;en&s;ation which enforces immediate action is what, I &s;up|po&s;e,
<PB N="5" REF="8">
Philo&s;ophers mean by in&s;tinct: if the word ever had any definite meaning. Thou&s;ands of the&s;e in&s;tinctive experi|ments are, no doubt, injurious to the ani|mals that make them: but, their number being unlimited, &s;ome of them are &s;uc|ce&s;sful. The benefit is remembered; they are repeated; and a future race profits by the wi&s;dom that becomes habi|tual. I am well per&s;uaded that my im|mer&s;ion in the &s;tream was a&s;&s;uaging; and game&s;ters hereafter, or the faculty them|&s;elves, may, if they plea&s;e, profit by the experiment.</P>
<P>I have no di&s;tinct recollection of com|ing out of the water: though I remem|ber walking afterward, two or three hours, till my cloaths were again entirely dry. My feelings, in the interval, were &s;ome|what &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the preceding evening; declining from frantic agita|tion to &s;tupidity, and torpor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>AN UNEXPECTED RENCONTRE; AND A DESPERATE CONTEST. VICTORY DEARLY BOUGHT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MAN is, or, which is the &s;ame thing, his &s;en&s;ations are, continually changing; and it may be truly affirmed that he is many different animals in the cour&s;e of a day. A very unexpected, yet very na|tural, incident again rouzed me, to a &s;tate of activity.</P>
<P>During my ramble, I had &s;trayed among the new buildings, below the Cre&s;cent. I know not whether I had any latent hope, or wi&s;h, of having a di&s;tant &s;ight of Oli|via, walking there as is cu&s;tomary for air and exerci&s;e: though I was certainly far too much degraded, in my own opinion, to intend being &s;een my&s;elf, even by her; much le&s;s by any of tho&s;e proud beings, tho&s;e ephemerae of fortune, with whom, while I de&s;pi&s;ed their arrogance, not to
<PB N="7" REF="10">
a&s;&s;ociate, not to be familiar, nay not to treat with a &s;ort of con&s;cious &s;uperiority, was mi&s;ery. We all practi&s;e that haugh|tine&s;s, our&s;elves, which, in others, is &s;o irritating to our feelings; and for which we pretend to have &s;o &s;overeign a con|tempt.</P>
<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed a number of workmen, my moody apathy, though great, did not pre|vent me from hearing one of them ex|claim, with a loud and &s;uddenly angry &s;urprize, "By G&mdash; that is he!"</P>
<P>I was at &s;ome little di&s;tance. I heard the &s;teps of a man running &s;peedily to|ward me. I turned round. He looked me full in the face; and, with no le&s;s ea|gerne&s;s, repeated&mdash;"Yes! D-mn me if it is not! Dick! Will! Come here! Run!"</P>
<P>I &s;tood fixed. I did not recollect ever to have &s;een the exact figure before me; but I had a &s;trong and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly a painful impre&s;&s;ion, of the &s;ame form in
<PB N="8" REF="11">
a different garb. It was the man whom I had accu&s;ed, the day before, of picking my pocket: the poor fellow who had been &s;o unmercifully ducked, and ill treated, by the mob.</P>
<P>His impatience of revenge was furious. Without uttering another word, he made a de&s;perate blow at me. I was unpre|pared; and it brought me to the ground. His foot was up, to &s;econd it with as vi|olent a kick; but, fortunately, the gene|rous &s;pirit of my opponent and the laws of mob honour were mutually my &s;hield. He recollected the cowardice as well as the opprobrium of kicking a combatant, when down; and, in the tone of rage, commanded me to get up.</P>
<P>I was not &s;low in obeying the man|date; nor he in repeating the a&s;&s;ault. I warded &s;everal of his blows, which were dealt with too much thoughtle&s;s fury to be dangerous; but again and again call|ed on him to &s;top, for a moment, and
<PB N="9" REF="12">
hear me. I felt I had been the cau&s;e of much mi&s;chief to the man; and had no alacrity to increa&s;e the wrong. My be|haviour was not that of fear; and his companions at length got between us, and for a moment prevented the battle.</P>
<P>We were at the bottom of the hill: the beginning of the fray had been &s;een, and the crowd was collecting in every direction. The beaus de&s;cended from the cre&s;cent; and left their belles to view us through their opera-gla&s;&s;es, and pocket-tele&s;copes, while they came to collect more circum&s;tantial information. The Mowbray family had ju&s;t arrived at this public <HI>promenade.</HI> Hector and tall Andrews joined the mob: the aunt and Olivia remained on the walk.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of the fal&s;e accu&s;ation, the ducking, and the injuries done to my antagoni&s;t, ran, varied and mangled, from mouth to mouth: a general &s;en|&s;ation of rage was excited again&s;t me;
<PB N="10" REF="13">
and Hector and Andrews very charitably gave it every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power. Not &s;atisfied with this, they propo&s;ed the <HI>Lex Talionis</HI>; and called&mdash;"Duck him!" "Duck him!" They took care, however, to turn their backs; imagining that, amid the hubbub, I &s;hould not di&s;tin|gui&s;h their voices.</P>
<P>My antagoni&s;t, though but a journey-man carpenter, had too much of the hero in him to admit of this mean revenge. His anger could only be appea&s;ed by cha&s;ti&s;ing me with his own arm; and proving to me, as well as to the crowd, how unworthy he was of that con|temptible character which my accu&s;ation had endeavoured to fix upon him. He was therefore determined to oblige me to fight.</P>
<P>I never remember to have felt greater repugnance, than I now had, to defend my&s;elf, by committing more hurt and in|jury upon this indignant, but brave, fel|low.
<PB N="11" REF="14">
I tried to expo&s;tulate, nay to intreat, but in vain: my remon&s;trances were con&s;trued into cowardice, and fight I mu&s;t, or &s;uffer &s;uch di&s;grace as my tyro-philo&s;ophy was ill calculated to endure.</P>
<P>My antagoni&s;t was &s;tripped in form; and, as the diver&s;ion of a battle is what an Engli&s;h mob will never willingly fore|go, I found parti&s;ans; who determined to &s;ee fair play, encouraged, in&s;tructed me, clapped me on the back, and, partly by intreaty partly by violence, &s;trip|ped off my coat. They were vexed at my ob&s;tinate refu&s;al to part with my wai&s;tcoat and &s;hirt.</P>
<P>With their u&s;ual activity, they &s;oon made a ring; and I &s;tood undetermined, and exce&s;&s;ively reluctant; not very wil|ling to receive, but infinitely aver&s;e to return the blows he now once more be|gan to deal!</P>
<P>The carpenter was an athletic and powerful man; famous for the battles he
<PB N="12" REF="15">
had fought, and the victories he had gained. His companions, who evidently had an affection for him, and who knew his prowe&s;s, had no &s;uppo&s;ition that I could with&s;tand him for five minutes: though the hopes of tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t eager for the &s;port had been a little rai&s;ed, by the alertne&s;s with which I ro&s;e, after being at fir&s;t knocked down, and the &s;kill with which I then &s;tood on my defence.</P>
<P>The doubts that pervaded my mind imparted, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;omething of that appearance to my countenance which is occa&s;ioned by fear; for my adver&s;ary ap|proached me with looks of contempt; and, as I retreated, bade me &s;tand for|ward and face him like a man. The crowd behind &s;econded him; and, fear|ing it &s;hould be a run-away victory, was rather willing to pre&s;s upon and pu&s;h me forward than to recede, and give me any play. Hector and Andrews were
<PB N="13" REF="16">
all the while very active, as in&s;tiga|tors.</P>
<P>My indeci&s;ion occa&s;ioned me to re|ceive &s;everal &s;evere blows, without re|turning one; till, at length, I was again extended on the ground, by a very de|&s;perate blow near the ear; which, for a few &s;econds, deprived me of all &s;en&s;e and recollection.</P>
<P>This was no longer to be endured. As &s;oon as I recovered, I &s;prang on my feet, conde&s;cended to &s;trip, and became in turn the a&s;&s;ailant. The joy and voci|feration of the mob were immen&s;e. They thought it had been all over; and to &s;ee me now ri&s;e, &s;tand forward, and fight, as I did, with &s;o much determination and effect, was, to them, rapture. They had di&s;covered a hero. Their education had taught them, for &s;uch is education, that the man who has the power to endure and to inflict the mo&s;t mi&s;ery is the mo&s;t admirable.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">For &s;ix &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rounds, I had com|pletely the advantage; during which my brave foe had received five knock-down blows: for that is the phra&s;e. His com|panions and friends were a&s;toni&s;hed. The beau pugili&s;ts were vociferating their bets; five pounds to a crown in my fa|vour.</P>
<P>The carpenter was as hardy as he was courageous. He collected him&s;elf; I had become le&s;s circum&s;pect, and he threw in another dangerous blow near my temple, with the left hand, that again felled me in&s;en&s;ible to the earth.</P>
<P>I now recovered more &s;lowly, and le&s;s effectually. I had been &s;everely breath|ed, by the violence of exertion. The laws of pugili&s;tic war will not &s;uffer a man to lie, after being knocked down, more than a certain number of &s;econds. Hector had his &s;top-watch in his hand; and tall Andrews joined him, to enforce the rule in all its rigour. I was lifted on
<PB N="15" REF="18">
my feet before I had perfectly recovered my recollection; and was again knocked down, though with le&s;s injury. While down, I received a kick in the &s;ide; of which my parti&s;ans in&s;tantly accu&s;ed Andrews.</P>
<P>Meaning to do me mi&s;chief, he did me a favour. The wrangling that took place gave me time to recover; and being again brought in face of my oppo|nent, I once more propo&s;ed a reconcilia|tion; and, &s;tretching out my arm, a&s;ked him to &s;hake hands. But, no. The ducking was too bitterly remembered. "He would beat me; or never go alive from the ground."</P>
<P>For a moment, the generous thought of acknowledging my&s;elf vanqui&s;hed &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf: but ri&s;ing vanity, and fal&s;e &s;hame, &s;purned at the propo&s;al; there|fore, &s;ince he was &s;o de&s;perate, I had no re&s;ource but in being equally &s;avage. Accordingly, I bent my whole powers to this dete&s;table purpo&s;e, brought him
<PB N="16" REF="19">
twice more to the ground, and, on the third a&s;&s;ault, gave him a blow that veri|fied his own prediction; for he fell dead at my feet, and was taken up lifele&s;s from the place.</P>
<P>Agony to agony! Vice to vice! Such was my fate! Where, when, how, was it to have an end? Were not my own per|&s;onal &s;ufferings &s;ufficient? Accu&s;e an in|nocent man of theft; deliver him over to the fury of a mob; and, not contented with that, meet him again to fight, beat, murder him! And without malice; with|out evil intention! Nay, with the very rever&s;e: abhorring the mi&s;chief I had done him; and admiring the intrepidity and fortitude he had di&s;played!</P>
<P>Nor did it end here: the intelligence that was in&s;tantly &s;ent round was horror indeed. He had left a wife and &s;even children!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE KIND BEHAVIOUR OF OLD FRIENDS. A JOYFUL RECOVERY. MORE MISFORTUNES. PATIENCE PER FORCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEVER were &s;en&s;ations more truly tragical than mine: yet, as is frequent, they had a da&s;h of the ridiculous; which re&s;ulted from the machinations of my good friends, Hector and Andrews. To in&s;pire others with the contempt in which they held, or rather endeavoured to hold, me, and to revenge the in&s;ults which they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to have received from me, were their incentives. They knew I had been &s;tripped of my money at the gaming-table: they mingled with the parti&s;ans of the carpenter; and, in|forming them that I was a pretended gentleman, advi&s;ed them to have me taken before a magi&s;trate; for that the law would at lea&s;t make me provide for
<PB N="18" REF="21">
the widow and children. Perhaps it would hang me: as I de&s;erved. They farther propo&s;ed a &s;ub&s;cription, to begin with me; and accordingly they came up to me, as by deputation, with the mur|dered man's hat.</P>
<P>The mortification they intended me had its full effect. I was pennyle&s;s; and the epithets which generous &s;ouls like the&s;e appropriate, to &s;uch up&s;tart in|truders upon their rights and privileges as my&s;elf, were muttered with as much in&s;olence as they had the courage to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>I was not yet tamed. I could not en|dure this baiting. I hated, almo&s;t ab|horred, Andrews. He dared to pretend love to Olivia: he had brought me into di&s;grace with her; nay was &s;oon to rob me of her everla&s;tingly; and, recollecting the kick he had be&s;towed upon me when down, I called him a &s;coundrel; and accom|panied the coar&s;e expre&s;&s;ion with a blow.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">In a moment, the mob were again in agitation, expected another battle, ad|mired my hardy valour, and called for a ring. Andrews knew better: he &s;aved them the trouble; and &s;huffled away; followed though &s;couted even by Hector him&s;elf, for his cowardice. Mowbray remembered the battle of the rats; and, by compari&s;on, found him&s;elf a very hero.</P>
<P>The moment I was permitted, I en|quired to what place the poor carpenter had been taken; and followed with in|finite terror, but with a faint degree of hope; &s;ome affirming that he was dead, others that he was not. I was attended by &s;everal of my admirers.</P>
<P>It would be vain to attempt any picture of what my feelings were, when, coming into his dwelling, I found him alive! &s;itting &s;urrounded by his wife, children, and companions! I fell on my knees to him. I owned all the mi&s;chief I had
<PB N="20" REF="23">
done him. I conjured him, for God's &s;ake, to forgive me. I was half frantic; and the worthy fellow, in the &s;ame free &s;pirit with which he had &s;ought, &s;tretched out his hand, in token of his forgivene&s;s and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>His unaffected magnanimity prompted me in&s;tantly to execute a de&s;ign which I had before formed. "Stay where you are, my good friends," &s;aid I, to the peo|ple that &s;tood round him. "I will be back in a few minutes. The little re|paration that I can make I will make: to &s;hew you that it was from error, and not ill intention, that I have done this brave man &s;o much injury."</P>
<P>So &s;aying, I ran out of the hou&s;e, di|rected my cour&s;e to my lodgings, and ha&s;tened to my trunk; to take out the ten-pound note, which I had re&s;erved to pay my Bath debts. My pa&s;&s;ions were too much in a hurry to admit of any en|quiry how the&s;e debts were to be paid,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
when I &s;hould have given the bank-note to the carpenter. I was determined not to enquire; but to appea&s;e my feelings, re&s;cue my character, and be&s;tow it on him.</P>
<P>Where were my troubles to end? The per&s;ecuting malice of fortune was intolerable. Philip, the footman whom I had hired, but &s;carcely ever employed, had di&s;appeared: having previou&s;ly brok|en open my trunk, and taken, with the ten pounds, &s;uch of my linen and effects as he could carry under his cloaths, and in his pockets, without being &s;een.</P>
<P>This was a &s;troke little le&s;s painful than the wor&s;t of the accidents that had be|fallen me: yet, &s;o hara&s;&s;ed was my mind, and &s;o wearied with grieving, that I did not feel it with half the poignancy.</P>
<P>Act however I mu&s;t. But how? I had left the carpenter and his family in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Mu&s;t I talk of favours which I could not confer? or mention remune|ration
<PB N="22" REF="25">
that would but &s;eem like mockery? This was painful: but not &s;o painful as fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>I therefore returned, related the &s;tory of the robbery, and added that "my intentions were to have endeavoured to afford &s;ome &s;mall recompence, for the unintentional injury I had committed. I was &s;orry that, at pre&s;ent, this accident had deprived me of the power: but I hoped I &s;hould not always be &s;o very de&s;titute. I certainly &s;hould neither forget the debt I had incurred, nor the noble behaviour of the man who had &s;uffered &s;o much from me. At pre&s;ent I was very unfortunate: but, if ever I &s;hould become more pro&s;perous, I &s;hould remember my obligation, and in what manner it would become me to &s;ee it di&s;charged."</P>
<P>I was heard with patience, and with no di&s;appointment. My auditors, though poor, were far from &s;elfi&s;h. Be&s;ide, as
<PB N="23" REF="26">
I had not previou&s;ly declared what I had intended, I had excited little expectation. My vanqui&s;hed opponent, who&s;e name was Clarke, was &s;oothed by the ju&s;tice I did him, in defending his innocence and prai&s;ing his courage; and &s;aid "I had given him the &s;atisfaction of a man, and that was all he a&s;ked." He rather &s;ym|pathized with my lo&s;s than felt a lo&s;s of his own; and gave various indications of a generous &s;pirit, &s;uch as is &s;eldom to be found among per&s;ons who would think them&s;elves highly di&s;graced by any com|pari&s;on between them and a poor car|penter. I own I quitted him with a degree of e&s;teem, &s;uch as neither the lord nor the bi&s;hop I had once been &s;o willing, or rather &s;o indu&s;trious, to revere had the good fortune to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid every thing I could recol|lect, to remove the doubts which the whole tran&s;action might have excited
<PB N="24" REF="27">
again&s;t me, I was eager to return to my lodging, and con&s;ider what was be&s;t to be done.</P>
<P>The probability of tracing my foot|man and recovering the bank note, a con&s;iderable portion of which by the bye was due to him for wages, &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf. I recollected that when I ro&s;e, after my two hours &s;leep, he had brought the breakfa&s;t; and had manife&s;ted &s;ome tokens of anxiety, at perceiving the perturbation of my mind. I had ha&s;tily devoured the bread and butter that was on the table, and drank a &s;ingle ba&s;on of tea; after which he enquired as I went out, when I &s;hould be back? And I had an&s;wered, in a wild manner, "I did not know. Per|haps never."</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A FEVER. BAD MEN HAVE GOOD QUALITIES. MORE PROOFS OF COMPASSION. A SCANDALOUS TALE DOES NOT LOSE IN TELLING. FAREWELL TO BATH.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE emptine&s;s of my &s;tomach (for I had eaten nothing except the bread and butter I mentioned, &s;ince the preceding day at dinner) the heats into which my violent exertions had thrown me, and the &s;udden rever&s;e of cold to which my motionle&s;s &s;leep &s;ubjected me, produced con&s;equences that might ea&s;ily have been fore&s;een: I awoke, in the dead of the night, and found my&s;elf &s;eized with &s;hivering fits, my teeth chattering, a &s;ickne&s;s at my &s;tomach, my head intoler|ably heavy, and my temples brui&s;ed with the blows I had received, and having a &s;en&s;ation as if they were ready to bur&s;t. To all this was added the &s;tiffne&s;s that per|vaded
<PB N="27" REF="30">
the mu&s;cles of my arms, and body, from the brui&s;es, falls, and battering they had received.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty I could undre&s;s my&s;elf, and get into bed; where, after I had lain &s;haking with increa&s;ing vio|lence I know not how long, my aguei&s;h &s;en&s;ations left me; and were changed into all the &s;orene&s;s, pains, and burning, that denote a violent fever.</P>
<P>During this paroxy&s;m, I felt con&s;ola|tion from its exce&s;s; which per&s;uaded me that I was now on my death bed. I remembered all the wrongs, which I con|ceived my&s;elf to have &s;uffered, with a &s;ort of mi&s;anthropical delight; ari&s;ing from the per&s;ua&s;ion that, in my lo&s;s, the world would be puni&s;hed for the vilene&s;s of its inju&s;tice toward me. Perhaps every hu|man being conceives that, when he is gone, there will be a cha&s;m, which no other mortal can &s;upply; and I am not certain that he does not conceive truly.
<PB N="28" REF="31">
Young men of active and impetuous ta|lents have this per&s;ua&s;ion in a very forci|ble degree.</P>
<P>All that I can remember of this fit of &s;ickne&s;s, till the violence and danger of it were over, is, that the people of the hou&s;e came to me in the morning, I knew not at what hour, and made &s;ome en|quiries. A delirium &s;ucceeded; which was &s;o violent that, at the beginning of my convale&s;cence, I had ab&s;olutely lo&s;t my memory; and could not without ef|fort recollect where I was, how I had come there, or what had befallen me. The fir&s;t objects that forcibly arre&s;ted my attention, and excited memory, were the hone&s;t carpenter, Clarke, and his wife &s;itting by my bed&s;ide, and endea|vouring to con&s;ole me.</P>
<P>The particulars which I afterward learn|ed were, that Belmont had come, the fir&s;t day of my illne&s;s; had &s;een me delirious; had heard the account of my having been
<PB N="29" REF="32">
robbed, and had left a twenty-pound note for my immediate nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>So true is it that the licentious, the de|praved, and the unprincipled are &s;u&s;cep|tible of virtue; and de&s;irous of commu|nicating happine&s;s. The mo&s;t ignorant only are the mo&s;t inveterately brutal: but nothing le&s;s than idioti&s;m, or mad|ne&s;s, can ab&s;olutely deprive man of his propen&s;ity to do good.</P>
<P>I was further informed that a &s;ealed paper, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Trevor, had been received, and opened in the pre&s;ence of the phy&s;ician, containing another twenty-pound bank-bill; but the paper that in|clo&s;ed it was blank: and that Clarke, un|able to go immediately to work, and re|flecting on what he had heard from me concerning the de&s;titute &s;tate in which I, a &s;tranger in Bath, was left by the rob|bery of my &s;ervant, had walked out the next day, had come with fear and diffi|dence to enquire after me, and that, find|ing
<PB N="30" REF="33">
me in a high fever, his wife bad been my fir&s;t nur&s;e.</P>
<P>Her own large family indeed prevented her from watching and continuing al|ways with me; and therefore another at|tendant was obliged to be hired: but &s;he was by my bed &s;ide the greate&s;t part of every day; and her hu&s;band the &s;ame till he was again able to work; after which he never failed to come in the evening.</P>
<P>He was a generous fellow. I had won his heart, by my de&s;ire to do him ju&s;tice; and my conde&s;cen&s;ion excited a degree of adoration in him, when he found that I was really what the world calls a gen|tleman. He had vi&s;ited me before Bel|mont had left the money; and, hearing the landlady talk of &s;ending me to the ho&s;pital, had propo&s;ed to take me to his home; that he and his wife might do a chri&s;tian part by me, and I not be left to the mercy of &s;trangers.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34">And here, as they are intimately con|nected with my own hi&s;tory, it is nece&s;|&s;ary I &s;hould mention &s;uch particulars as I have &s;ince learned, concerning Olivia.</P>
<P>Hector and Andrews had been bu&s;y, in collecting all the particulars they could, relating to me, from, the mob; among whom the &s;trange&s;t rumours ran: of which the&s;e my fa&s;t friends were predi&s;|po&s;ed to &s;elect the mo&s;t unfavourable, and to believe and report them as true. All of the&s;e they carried to Olivia, and her aunt; and the chief of them were, that I had fal&s;ely accu&s;ed a man of theft, had &s;eized him by the collar, dragged him to the water, and had been the prin|cipal per&s;on in ducking him to death. The brother of this man had di&s;covered who I was; and had followed me, with his comrades, to have me taken before a magi&s;trate: but I had artfully talked to the people round me, had got a part of the mob on my &s;ide, and had then be|gun
<PB N="32" REF="35">
to beat and ill u&s;e the brother. They added that I had &s;tripped like a common brui&s;er, of which character I was ambi|tious; that the brother had &s;ought with uncommon bravery; that he had been treated with foul play, by me and my abettors; and that, in conclu&s;ion, I had killed him: that, in addition to this, I had prevented a &s;ub&s;cription, for the wi|dow and <HI>nine</HI> young children, which had been propo&s;ed by them; that I had in|&s;ulted them, &s;truck at Andrews, and chal|lenged him to box with me, for this their charitable endeavour to relieve the widow and her children; and that, having lo&s;t my la&s;t guinea at the gaming table the night before in their pre&s;ence, I &s;hould probably run away from my lodgings, or perhaps turn highwayman; for which they thought me quite de&s;perate enough.</P>
<P>It may well be imagined what effect a &s;tory like this would produce, on the mind of Olivia: corroborated as it was,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
though not proved in every incident, by the circum&s;tances which &s;he her&s;elf had witne&s;&s;ed from the cre&s;cent, by tho&s;e which &s;he gathered on enquiry from other people, by her own experience of my ra&s;h impetuo&s;ity, and the&s;e all height|ened by the conjectures of an active ima|gination, and a heart not wholly unin|tere&s;ted. She hoped indeed that I had not actually killed two men: but &s;he had the mo&s;t dreadful doubts.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion it made upon her did not e&s;cape the penetration of the aunt; and &s;he determined to quit Bath, and take Olivia with her, the very next day. Terrified by the po&s;&s;ibility that the pre|dictions of Hector and Andrews &s;hould be fulfilled, Olivia ventured &s;ecretly to in&s;truct her maid to &s;earch the book in the pump room, and find my addre&s;s, and afterward to &s;end her with the twen|ty-pound bank-bill: hoping, that this temporary re&s;ource might have &s;ome
<PB N="34" REF="37">
&s;mall chance of preventing the fatal con|&s;equences which &s;he feared.</P>
<P>Had they returned to London, by the aid of Mi&s;s Wilmot and Mary, &s;he might have made further enquiries: but the cautious aunt directed her cour&s;e to Scar|borough.</P>
<P>I was exce&s;&s;ively reduced by the fe|ver. According to the phy&s;ician and apothecary, my life had been in extreme danger; and eight weeks elap&s;ed before I was able to quit Bath. The expences I had incurred amounted to between eight and nine and twenty pounds. I was ful|ly determined to be&s;tow the ten pounds I had originally intended on Clarke. Thus, after di&s;tributing &s;uch &s;mall gifts among the &s;ervants as cu&s;tom and my notion of the manners of a gentleman demanded, the only choice I had was, either to &s;ell my cloaths, or, with four and &s;ixpence in my pocket, to undertake a journey to London on foot.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38">I preferred the latter, &s;ent my trunk to the waggon, returned for the la&s;t time to my lodging, inclo&s;ed a ten pound note in a letter, in which I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;en&s;e of the worth of Clarke, and my &s;orrow for the evil I had done him, and, &s;end|ing it by the maid-&s;ervant, I followed, and watched her to his dwelling.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE PAIN OF PARTING. THE PROSPECT BEFORE ME. POOR MEN HAVE THEIR AFFECTIONS AND FRIENDSHIPS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>DURING my recovery, I had conver&s;ed freely on my own affairs, with Clarke and his wife. They gradually became ac|quainted with my whole hi&s;tory; and di&s;covered &s;o much intere&s;t in the pic|tures I drew, and entered &s;o &s;ympatheti|cally and with &s;uch unaffected marks of pa&s;&s;ion into all my feelings, that I found
<PB N="36" REF="39">
not only great ea&s;e but con&s;iderable de|light, in narrating my fears, hopes, and mi&s;haps.</P>
<P>Clarke had a &s;trong under&s;tanding; and was not entirely illiterate. His wife was active, cleanly, and kind. Their children were managed with great good &s;en&s;e: the three elde&s;t were put out, two to &s;ervice, and the other an appren|tice; and, large as their family was, they had, by labour and oeconomy, advanced a con&s;iderable &s;tep from the extreme po|verty to which &s;uch per&s;ons are too often &s;ubject.</P>
<P>When I went to take leave of them, I could perceive, not only that they were both very much affected, but that Clarke had &s;omething more on his imagination. He had a great re&s;pect for my gentility, and learning; and was always afraid of being too familiar. At &s;ome moments, he felt as it were the in&s;olence of having fought with me: at others a gleam of
<PB N="37" REF="40">
exultation broke forth, at his having had that honour. He had &s;everal times ex|pre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t wi&s;h that he might be &s;o happy as to &s;ee me again; and, when I a&s;&s;ured him that he &s;hould hear from me, his feelings were partly doubt, and partly &s;trong delight.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was prepared to bid them fare|well, he gave a deep &s;igh; and &s;aid "he thought he &s;hould &s;oon come to Lon|don. He wi&s;hed he knew where I might be found, and, if he &s;hould leave the country, it would be a great favour done him if he might but be allowed to come and a&s;k me how I did. If I would allow him that honour, it would make his heart very light. He had been many years in his pre&s;ent employ; and perhaps his ma&s;|ter would be &s;orry, if he were to leave him; but he had given him fair notice. At one time, he did not believe he ever &s;hould have left him; but he thought
<PB N="38" REF="41">
now he &s;hould be much happier in Lon|don."</P>
<P>His tone was &s;erious, there was a de|jectedne&s;s in his manner, and with it, as was evident, much &s;mothered emotion in his heart. I was affected; and taking his hand, earne&s;tly a&s;&s;ured him that, if ever fortune &s;hould &s;mile on me, I would not forget what had happened at Bath. His parting reply was, "God be with you, wherever you go! Perhaps you may &s;ee me again &s;ooner than you think for."</P>
<P>This was the temper in which we took leave, previous to my &s;ending the maid with the ten-pound note: and, as I pa&s;&s;ed within &s;ight of his door, I felt the regret of quitting a human being who&s;e attach|ment to me was manife&s;tly &s;o &s;trong and affectionate. But I had no alternative; and I pur&s;ued my road.</P>
<P>Winter was advancing: the weather was rainy: the roads were heavy. The
<PB N="39" REF="42">
cloudy &s;ky &s;ympathi&s;ed with the gloom of the pro&s;pect before me. I had wa&s;ted my patrimony, quarrelled with my pro|tectors, renounced the univer&s;ity, had no profe&s;&s;ion, no immediate re&s;ource, and had my&s;elf and my mother to provide for: by what means I knew not.</P>
<P>The experience of Wilmot &s;eemed to prove how precarious a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence the labours of literature afford; and Wil|mot was indi&s;putably a man of genius.</P>
<P>I had not quite concluded again&s;t the morality of the practice of the law: but I remembered, in part, the objections of Turl; and they were &s;taggering. Had it been otherwi&s;e, where would have been the advantage? I had entered of the Temple: but I had neither the means of keeping my terms nor the patience to look forward, for precarious wealth and fame, to &s;o di&s;tant a period.</P>
<P>All this might have been endured: but Olivia?&mdash;Where was &s;he?&mdash;Per|haps,
<PB N="40" REF="43">
at that moment, the wife of An|drews!&mdash;Or if not, grant &s;he were ne|ver to be his, &s;he never could be mine. Yet mine &s;he mu&s;t be! Mine &s;he &s;hould be! I would brave the de&s;poti&s;m of her odious en&s;lavers! I would move heaven and earth! I would defy hell it&s;elf to &s;e|parate us!</P>
<P>Such were the continual conflicts to which I was &s;ubject: and, while the fogs of de&s;pondency ro&s;e thick aud murky around me, with them continually ro&s;e the <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> of hope; dancing before my eyes, and encouraging me &s;tep after &s;tep to follow on.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering how wild and extravagant the de&s;ires of youth are, it is happy for them that they calculate &s;o ill; and are &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted. Their de&s;pair would el&s;e be frequently fatal.</P>
<P>I did not forget, as a &s;uppo&s;ed imme|diate means of relief, that my pamphlet again&s;t the Earl and the Bi&s;hop was
<PB N="41" REF="44">
printed; and I thought the revenge more than ju&s;tifiable: it was a nece&s;&s;ary vin|dication of my own honour and claims. I was indeed forty pounds in debt: twen|ty to Belmont; and twenty more to I knew not whom: though I &s;u&s;pected, and partly hoped partly feared, it was Olivia. I hoped it, becau&s;e it might be affection. I feared it, left it &s;hould be nothing more than pity; for one whom &s;he had known in her childhood, but whom, now he was a man, &s;he might compa&s;&s;ionate; but mu&s;t contemn. To have been obliged even to Olivia, on the&s;e terms, was wor&s;e than &s;tarving. Such were my medita|tions through the day; which was a lit|tle advanced when I left Bath.</P>
<P>I was eager to perform my journey, and had walked at a great rate. A little before twilight, I heard a di&s;tant call, two or three times repeated. At la&s;t, I turned round, &s;aw a hat waving, and heard my own name.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45">I &s;topped; and the per&s;on approach|ed. It was Clarke. I was &s;urpri&s;ed; and enquired the rea&s;on of his following me. He was embarra&s;&s;ed; and began with reque&s;ting I would go a little &s;lower, for he had run and walked till he was half tired, and he would tell me.</P>
<P>Clarke was an untaught orator. He had very &s;trong feelings; and a clear head; which are the two grand &s;ources of eloquence. "You know," &s;aid he, "how much mi&s;chief I have done you; for it cannot be denied. I &s;truck you fir&s;t, and knocked you down when you <HI>was</HI> off your guard. I &s;et every body again&s;t you. I refu&s;ed to &s;hake hands with you, over and over, when you had the goodne&s;s to offer to forgive me. And, la&s;t of all, you may thank me for the fe|ver; which brought you to death's door. You forgave me this, as well as the re&s;t. But that was not all. That would not content you. Becau&s;e I had been u&s;ed
<PB N="43" REF="46">
ill, without any malice of yours, nothing would &s;atisfy you but to &s;trip your&s;elf of the little <HI>modicum</HI> that you had, and give it to me. So that, I am &s;ure, you have hardly a &s;hilling to take you up to Lon|don. And, when you are there, you are not &s;o well off as I am: you have no trade. I can turn my hand to twenty things: you have never been u&s;ed to hard work; and how you are to live God Almighty knows! For I am &s;ure I can|not find out; though I have been think|ing of nothing el&s;e for weeks and weeks pa&s;t."</P>
<P>"Why &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e I have no money?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e I am &s;ure of it. I a&s;ked and found out all that you had to pay. The &s;ervants too told me how open-hearted you <HI>was;</HI> &s;o that you had given away all you had. Shame on 'em for taking it, &s;ay I! You are not fit to live in this world! And then to &s;end me ten pounds,
<PB N="44" REF="47">
who have a hou&s;e and home, and hands to work! But I'll be damned if I keep it!"</P>
<P>"Nay but, indeed you mu&s;t."</P>
<P>"I will not! I will not! I would not for&s;wear my&s;elf for all the money in the world! And I have &s;worn it, again and again. So take it! Nay, here, take it! &mdash;If you don't, I'll throw it down in the road; and let the fir&s;t that comes find it; for I'll not for&s;wear my&s;elf. So pray now, I beg, for God's &s;ake, you will take it!"</P>
<P>I found it was in vain to contend with him: he was too determined, and had taken this oath in the &s;implicity of his heart, that it might not be po&s;&s;ible for him to recede. I therefore accepted the money: but I endeavoured, having re|ceived it to &s;atisfy his oath, to per&s;uade him to take a part of it back again. My efforts were fruitle&s;s. "He had three half crowns," he told me, "in his poc|ket;
<PB N="45" REF="48">
which would &s;erve his turn, till he could get more: and he had left five gui|neas at home; &s;o that there was no fear his wife and children &s;hould want."</P>
<P>Happy, enviable, &s;tate of indepen|dance! When a man and his wife and family, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of five guineas, are &s;o wealthy that they are in no fear of want!</P>
<P>Having complied, becau&s;e I found, though I could equal him in bodily ac|tivity, I could not vanqui&s;h him in ge|nero&s;ity, I reque&s;ted him to return to the place we ju&s;t had pa&s;&s;ed through, and take up his lodging.</P>
<P>He replied, "To be &s;ure he was a little tired; for he had &s;et out a good hour after me, and I had come at a rare rate. Not but that he could keep his ground, though I was &s;o good a footman; but that it did not become him to make him|&s;elf my companion."</P>
<P>"Companion!" &s;aid I. "Why are not you going back to Bath?"</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="49">"No: I have taken my leave of it. I &s;hall go and &s;et up my re&s;t in London. I have not been &s;harking to my ma&s;ter. I thought of it &s;ome time &s;ince, and gave him fair notice; and more than that, I got him another man in my room; which is all he could demand: and I hope he will &s;erve him as hone&s;tly as I have done."</P>
<P>"What, would you for&s;ake your wife and children?"</P>
<P>"For&s;ake my wife and children!"</P>
<P>[There was a mixed emotion of indig|nant &s;orrow and &s;urprize in his counte|nance.]</P>
<P>"I did not think, Mr. Trevor, you could have believed me to be &s;uch a ba&s;e villain."</P>
<P>"I do not believe it! I never could believe it! I &s;poke thoughtle&s;&s;ly. I &s;aw you were too happy together for that to be po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"For&s;ake my dear Sally, and our Bill,

and Bet, and &mdash;? No! I'd &s;ooner take up my axe and chop off my hand! There is not another man in England has &s;uch a wife! I have &s;een bad ones enough; and, for the matter of that, bad hu&s;bands too. But that's nothing. If you will do me the favour, I &s;hould take it kind of you to let me walk with you, and keep you company, now night is coming on, to the next town; and then you may take &s;ome re&s;t, and wait for the &s;tage in the morning. I &s;hall make my way; and find you out, I &s;uppo&s;e, fa&s;t enough in London."</P>
<P>"Are you then determined to go to town?"</P>
<P>"Yes: it is all &s;ettled. I told Sally; and &s;he did cry a little to be &s;ure: but &s;he was &s;oon &s;atisfied. She knows me; and I never in my life found her piggi&s;h. God be her holy keeper!"</P>
<P>"Why then, come along. We'll go
<PB N="48" REF="51">
together. If I ride, you &s;hall ride: if you walk, &s;o will I."</P>
<P>"Will you? God ble&s;s you! You know how to win a man's heart! There is not &s;o good or &s;o brave a fellow; I mean gentleman, upon the face of the earth, damn me if there is! I beg your pardon! Indeed I do! But you force it out of one! One can't remember to keep one's di&s;tance, with you. However, I will try to be more becoming."</P>
<P>The manner of Clarke was more im|pre&s;&s;ive than his words: though they, generally &s;peaking, were not unapt.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued our way together, mutu|ally gratified by what had pa&s;&s;ed. Per|haps there is no &s;en&s;ation that &s;o cheers, and &s;ooths the &s;oul, as the knowledge that there are other human beings, who&s;e happine&s;s &s;eems knitted and bound up with our own; willing to &s;hare our fate, receive our favours, and, whenever oc|ca&s;ion

offers, to return them ten fold! And the plea&s;ure is infinitely increa&s;ed, when tho&s;e who are ambitious of being beloved by us &s;eem to feel, and acknow|ledge, that we have more amply the pow|er of conferring than even of receiving happine&s;s.</P>

<P>WHILE we had been di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the above points, we had &s;at down; and ro&s;e to pur&s;ue our journey, as &s;oon as we had brought them to a conclu&s;ion. We were on the borders of a fore&s;t. As we proceeded, we came up with a coun|tryman; who, enquiring where we were going, told us that, by &s;triking a little out of the road, we might &s;ave half a mile.
<PB N="50" REF="53">
We had nine miles to travel, to the inn at which the &s;tage coaches &s;topped; and were very willing, Clarke e&s;pecially, to &s;horten the way. The countryman &s;aid he was going part of the road; and that the remainder was &s;o plain it could not be mi&s;taken. Accordingly, we put our|&s;elves under his guidance.</P>
<P>The &s;un had been down, by this time, nearly an hour and a half. The moon gave &s;ome light; but the wind was ri&s;ing, &s;he was continually ob&s;cured by thick &s;wift-flying clouds, and our conductor advi&s;ed us to pu&s;h on, for it was likely to be a very bad night.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a quarter of an hour his prophecy began to be fulfilled. The rain fell, and at intervals the oppo&s;ing clouds and currents of air, aided by the impe|diments of hills and trees, gave us a full variety of that whi&s;tling, roaring, and howling, which is heard in high winds.</P>

I was about to reque&s;t the countryman to lead us to &s;ome village, or even barn, for &s;helter, when he &s;uddenly &s;truck into ano|ther path; and, bidding us good night, again told us "we could not mi&s;s our road." We could not &s;ee where he was gone to; and, though we repeatedly called, we called in vain: he was too anx|ious to get &s;helter him&s;elf to heed our anxiety, and was &s;oon out of hearing.</P>
<P>So long as we could di&s;cern, the path we were in appeared to be tolerably beaten: but we now could no longer trace any path; for it was too dark for the ground to have any di&s;tinct colour. We had &s;kirted the fore&s;t; and our only remaining guide was a hedge on our left.</P>
<P>In this hedge we placed our hopes. We followed its direction, I know not how long, till it &s;uddenly turned off, at an angle; and we found our&s;elves, as far as we could conjecture, from the in|tervening lights and the &s;trenuous efforts
<PB N="52" REF="55">
we made to di&s;cover the objects around us, on the edge of &s;ome wild place, pro|bably a heath, with hills, and con&s;e|quently deep vallies, perhaps &s;treams of water, and precipices.</P>
<P>We pau&s;ed; we knelt down, examin|ed with our eyes, and felt about with our hands, to di&s;cover whether we yet were in a path; but could find none.</P>
<P>We continued our con&s;ultation, till we had begun to think it advi&s;able to re|turn, once more guided by the hedge. Yet this was not only very uncertain, but the idea of a retrograde motion was by no means plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>While we were in this irre&s;olute di|lemma, we thought we &s;aw a light; that glimmered for a moment, and as &s;ud|denly di&s;appeared. We watched, I know not how long, and again &s;aw it twinkle, though, as we thought, in &s;omething of a different direction. Clarke &s;aid it was a Will o'the whi&s;p. I replied, it might
<PB N="53" REF="56">
be one, but, as it &s;eemed the only chance we had, my advice was to continue our walk in that direction; in hopes that, if it were a light proceeding from any hou&s;e or village, it would become more vi&s;ible as we approached.</P>
<P>We walked on, I know not how far; and then pau&s;ed; but di&s;covered no more of the light. We walked again; again &s;tood &s;till, and looked on every &s;ide of us, either for the light or any other object; but we could &s;ee nothing di&s;tinctly. The ob&s;cure forms around us had varied their appearance; and whether they were hills, or clouds, or what they were, we could not po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover: though the fir&s;t we &s;till thought was the mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>By this time, we had no certain recol|lection of which way we had come; or to what point we were directing our cour&s;e. We were continually in doubt: now pau&s;ing; now conjecturing; now proceeding.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">We continued to wander, we knew not whither. Sometimes it appeared we went up hill: and &s;ometimes down. We had &s;tepped very cautiou&s;ly, and there|fore very &s;lowly; had warned each other continually to be careful; and had not dared to take twenty &s;teps at a time, without mutually enquiring to know if all were &s;afe.</P>
<P>We continued, environed as it were by the objects that mo&s;t powerfully in|&s;pire fear; by the darkne&s;s of night, the tumult of the elements, the utter igno|rance of where we were or by what ob|jects &s;urrounded, and the dejectedne&s;s which our &s;ituation in&s;pired. Thieves and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins might be at our back, and we could not hear them: gulphs, rocks, or river, in our front, or on either &s;ide, and we could not &s;ee them. The next &s;tep might plunge us, headlong, we knew not whither.</P>
<P>The&s;e fears were not all imaginary.
<PB N="55" REF="58">
Finding the ground very uneven on a &s;udden, and &s;tumbling dangerou&s;ly my|&s;elf, I &s;tood &s;till&mdash;I did not hear my com|panion!&mdash;I called &mdash; I received no an|&s;wer! I repeated, in a louder tone, "Clarke! Where are you? "&mdash;Still no an&s;wer!</P>
<P>I then &s;houted, with all the fear that I felt, and heard a faint re&s;pon&s;e, that &s;eemed to be beneath me, and at a pro|digious di&s;tance. It terrified; yet it relieved. We had &s;poken not three mi|nutes before. I &s;tood &s;ilent, in hopes he would &s;peak again: but my fears were too violent to remain &s;o long. I once more called; and he replied, with rather a louder voice which le&s;&s;ened the appa|rent di&s;tance, "Take care! You'll da&s;h your&s;elf to pieces!"</P>
<P>"Are you hurt?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"I hope not much," returned he. "For God's &s;ake take care of your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"Can you walk?"</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59">"I &s;hall be able pre&s;ently, I believe."</P>
<P>"How can I get to you?"</P>
<P>"I don't know."</P>
<P>"Stay where you are, and I will try."</P>
<P>"For God in heaven's &s;ake don't! You'll certainly break your neck! I &s;up|po&s;e I am in a chalk pit, or at the bottom of a &s;teep crag."</P>
<P>"I will crawl to you on my hands and knees."</P>
<P>"Good God! You will &s;urely kill your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"Nothing can be more dangerous than to lie here on the wet ground. We mu&s;t only take care to keep within hear|ing of each other."</P>
<P>While I &s;poke, I began to put my crawling expedient in practice; &s;till call|ing to Clarke, every half minute, and en|deavouring to proceed in the direction of his voice.</P>
<P>I found the rough impediments around me increa&s;e; till, pre&s;ently, I came to one
<PB N="57" REF="60">
that was ruder than the re&s;t. I crawled upon it, &s;u&s;tained by my knees and right hand, and &s;tretching forward with my left. I groped, but felt nothing. I cautiou&s;ly laid my belly to the ground and &s;tretched out my other arm. Still it was vacancy. I &s;tretched a little more violently; feeling forward, and on each &s;ide; and I &s;eemed to be projected upon a point, my head and &s;houlders inclining over a dark aby&s;s, which the imagination left unfathomable.</P>
<P>I own I felt terror; and the &s;en&s;ation certainly was not le&s;&s;ened, when, making an attempt to recover my po&s;ition and go back, my &s;upport began to give way. My effort to retreat was as violent as my terror: but it was too late. The ground &s;hook, loo&s;ened, and, with the &s;truggle I made carrying me with it, toppled headlong down.</P>
<P>What the height that I fell was I have no means of a&s;certaining; for the
<PB N="58" REF="61">
heath on which we were wandering abounds with quarries, and precipices; but either it was, in fact, or my fears made it prodigious.</P>
<P>Had this expedient been propo&s;ed un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances, as the only pro|bable one of bringing me and Clarke together again, who would not have &s;huddered at it? Yet, though it is true I received a violent &s;hock, I know of no injury that it did me.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I recovered my pre&s;ence of mind, I replied to Clarke; who&s;e que&s;|tions were vehement; he having heard me fall. After mutual enquiry, we found we were both once more upon our legs; and had e&s;caped broken bones. Though they had been &s;everely &s;haken: Clarke's much the mo&s;t violently.</P>
<P>But where were we now? How &s;hould we di&s;cover? Perhaps in a &s;tone quarry; or lime pit. Perhaps at the edge of waters. It might be we had fallen down
<PB N="59" REF="62">
only on the fir&s;t bank, or ridge of a quarry; and had a precipice ten fold more dreadful before us.</P>
<P>While we were conjecturing, the &s;troke of a large clock, brought whizzing in the wind, &s;truck full upon our ear. We li&s;tened, with the mo&s;t anxious ardour. The next &s;troke was very, very faint: a different current had carried it a diffe|rent way: and, with all our eager atten|tion, we could not be certain that we heard any more. Yet, though we had lo&s;t much time and our progre&s;s had been exce&s;&s;ively tedious, it could not be two o'clock in the morning. It might in|deed very probably be twelve.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;troke of the clock made us conjecture it came from &s;ome &s;teeple, or hall tower, at no very great di&s;tance. The &s;econd carried our imaginations we knew not whither. We had not yet recovered courage enough to take more &s;teps than were nece&s;&s;ary to come to each
<PB N="60" REF="63">
other; and, while we were con&s;idering, during an intermitting pau&s;e of the roar|ing of the wind, we di&s;tinctly heard a cur yelp.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this, we immediately hallooed with all our might. The wind again began to chafe, and &s;well, and &s;eemed to mock at our di&s;tre&s;s. Still we repeated our efforts, whenever the wind pau&s;ed: but, in&s;tead of voices intending to an&s;wer our calls, we heard &s;hrill whi&s;t|lings; which certainly were produced by men.</P>
<P>Could it be by good men? By any but night marauders; intent on mi&s;chief, but di&s;turbed and alarmed? They were &s;ignals indubitably; for we &s;houted again, they were again given, and were then re|peated from another quarter: at lea&s;t, if they were not, they were miraculou&s;ly imitated, by the dying away of the wind.</P>
<P>In a little while, we again heard the cur yelp; and immediately afterward a
<PB N="61" REF="64">
howling, which was &s;o mingled with the bla&s;t, that we could not tell whether it were the wind it&s;elf, the yelling of a dog, or the agonizing cries of a human voice: but it was a dreadfully di&s;mal &s;ound. We li&s;tened with perturbed and deep attention; and it was &s;everal times repeated, with increa&s;ing uncertainty, confu&s;ion, and terror.</P>
<P>What was to be done? My patience was exhau&s;ted. Danger it&s;elf could no longer detain me; and I told Clarke I was determined to make toward the village, or whatever the place was, from whence, dangerous and doubtful as they were, the&s;e various &s;ounds pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>Finding me re&s;olute, he was very earne&s;t to have led the way; and, when I would not permit him, he gra&s;ped me by the hand, and told me that, if there were pitfalls and gulphs, and if I did go down, unle&s;s he &s;hould have &s;trength

enough to &s;ave me, we would go down together.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS IN SUCCESSION. A PLACE OF HORRORS AND ITS INMATES. A DIA|LOGUE WORTHY OF THE PLACE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS we were cautiou&s;ly and &s;lowly tak|ing &s;tep by &s;tep, and, as new conjectures cro&s;&s;ed us, &s;topping to con&s;ider, we again &s;aw a dancing light; but more di&s;tinctly, though, as we imagined, not very near. We repeated our calls; but, whether they were or were not heard, they were not an&s;wered. We ventured, however, to quicken our pace; for we continued, at intervals, to catch the light.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, we &s;aw the light no more; and a con&s;iderable time again elap&s;ed, which was &s;pent in wandering as this or that &s;uppo&s;ition directed us; till at la&s;t,
<PB N="63" REF="66">
&s;uddenly and very unexpectedly, we per|ceived lines and forms, that convinced us they appertained to &s;ome hou&s;e, or man|&s;ion; and, as it appeared to us, a large one. We approached it, examined, &s;houted, and endeavoured to di&s;cover which was the entrance. But all was &s;till, all dark, all clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>We continued our &s;earch on the out|&s;ide; till, at length, we came to a large gate that was open; which we entered, and proceeded to &s;ome di&s;tance till we arrived at a door, that evidently belonged to an out-hou&s;e or detached building. It was &s;hut; and, feeling about, we found that the key was in the lock. We had little he&s;itation in profiting by the acci|dent. We had been &s;helterle&s;s too long, and the circum&s;tances pleaded too power|fully, for us to indulge any &s;cruples; and accordingly we entered.</P>
<P>We had no &s;ooner put our heads within the door but we found our&s;elves a&s;&s;aulted with a &s;mell, or rather &s;tench,
<PB N="64" REF="67">
&s;o intolerable as almo&s;t to drive us back: but the fury of the elements, and perhaps the le&s;s delicate organs of Clarke, who &s;eemed determined to profit by the &s;hel|ter we had obtained, induced us to brave an inconvenience which, though ex|ce&s;&s;ively offen&s;ive at fir&s;t, became le&s;s the longer we continued.</P>
<P>Groping about, we di&s;covered &s;ome barrels, and lumber; behind which there was &s;traw. Here we determined to lie down; and re&s;t our brui&s;ed and aching bones. Our cloaths had been drenched and dried more than once, in the cour&s;e of the night; and they were at pre&s;ent neither wet nor dry.</P>
<P>We had &s;carcely ne&s;tled together in our &s;traw, before we again heard the yelping of the cur, arid pre&s;ently after|ward the &s;ame di&s;mal howls repeated. To the&s;e, at no great di&s;tance, &s;uc|ceeded the &s;hrill whi&s;tling &s;ignals. Our imaginations had been &s;o highly wrought up that they were apt at horrible
<PB N="65" REF="68">
conjectures; and, for my part, my own was at that moment very bu&s;ily employed in conjuring them up.</P>
<P>In the very mid&s;t of this activity, we heard the voices of men, walking round the building. They again whi&s;tled, with a piercing &s;hrillne&s;s; and, though we heard nothing di&s;tinctly, yet we caught tones that were coar&s;e, rude, and &s;avage; and words, that denoted anger and anxiety, for the perpetration of &s;ome dark purpo&s;e no doubt corre&s;ponding to the fierce and threatening &s;ounds we heard.</P>
<P>They approached. One of them had a lanthorn. He came up to the door; and, finding it open, boi&s;terou&s;ly &s;hut it; with a broad and bitter cur&s;e again&s;t the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome man, who&s;e name he pronounced, for leaving it open; and eternally damning others, for being &s;o long in doing their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>We were now locked in; and we &s;oon heard no more of the voices.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69">In &s;pite of all the&s;e alarms, the mo|ment they cea&s;ed our condition, com|paring it with the tempe&s;t and difficulties without, &s;eemed to be much bettered; and we once more prepared our&s;elves for &s;leep, while fear gave place to fatigue.</P>
<P>Our re&s;t was of &s;hort duration. We began indeed to &s;lumber; but I was pre|&s;ently di&s;turbed by Clarke, whom I found &s;haking in the mo&s;t: violent agitation and horror that I ever witne&s;&s;ed in any hu|man being.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked "what is the matter?"</P>
<P>He replied with a groan!</P>
<P>I was awakened from wild &s;lumbers of my own, and &s;trongly partook of his &s;en&s;ations; but endeavoured however to rouze him to &s;peech, and recollection. Again and again I a&s;ked "what have you heard? What ails you?"</P>
<P>It was long before he could utter an articulate &s;ound. At la&s;t, &s;haking more violently as he &s;poke, and with inexpre&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="67" REF="70">
horror in his voice, he ga&s;ping &s;aid &mdash;"A dead hand!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Where?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I felt it!&mdash;I had hold of it!&mdash;It is now at my neck."</P>
<P>For a moment I pau&s;ed: not daring to &s;tretch out my arm, and examine. I trembled in &s;ympathy with him. At length I ventured.</P>
<P>Never &s;hall I forget the &s;en&s;ation I experienced, when, to my full conviction, I actually felt a cold, dead, hand, between my fingers!</P>
<P>I was &s;uffocated with horror! I &s;trug|gled to overcome it: again it &s;eized me; and I &s;unk half entranced!</P>
<P>At this very in&s;tant, the &s;hrill &s;ound of the whi&s;tle rung, piercing, through the di&s;mal place in which we were impri&s;on|ed. It was an&s;wered. The &s;ame hoar&s;e voices once more were heard: but in tones fifty fold more dire.</P>
<P>One terror combated the other, and
<PB N="68" REF="71">
we were recalled to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing and under&s;tanding. We lay &s;ilent, not daring to breathe, when we heard the door unlock. Our feelings will not readily be conceived, while the following dialogue pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"What a damned while you have kept us waiting, &s;uch a night as this!"</P>
<P>"What ails the night? It is a &s;pecial good night, for our trade."</P>
<P>"What the devil have you been about?"</P>
<P>About? Doing our bu&s;ine&s;s, to be &s;ure: and doing it to &s;ome purpo&s;e, I tell you. Is not the night as bad for us as for you? Who had the be&s;t of it, do you think? What had you to do, but to keep on the &s;cout?"</P>
<P>"How came you to leave the door open, and be d&mdash;mn'd to you?"</P>
<P>"Who left the door open, Jack Dingyface? We left the key in it, in|deed; for &s;uch lubbers as you to pa&s;s in

<P>"Who do you call lubber, Bull-calf? We have had as much to do as your&s;elves. There has been an alarm given; for we have heard noi&s;es and hallooing all night. For my part, I don't much like it. We &s;hall be &s;moked: nay it is my belief we are already; and I have a great mind to decamp, and leave the country."</P>
<P>" You are always in a panic. Who is to &s;moke us?"</P>
<P>"Well, mark my words, it will come upon us when we lea&s;t think of it."</P>

<P>"To bed. It's high time."</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE SCENE CONTINUED; AND OUR TERRORS IN|CREASED. AN INTERESTING DIALOGUE, THAT UNRAVELS THE MYSTERY. THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HERE to our infinite ea&s;e they quitted us, went through an inner door that led to the hou&s;e, locked it after them, and left us, not only with the dead hand, not only with the dead body, but in the mo&s;t di&s;mal human &s;laughter-hou&s;e that murder and horror ever con|&s;tructed, or ever conceived. Such were our impre&s;&s;ions: and &s;uch, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, they would have been, perhaps, of the brave&s;t man, or man-killer, that ever exi&s;ted. Alexander and Cae&s;ar them&s;elves would have &s;hook, lying as we lay, hearing what we heard, and &s;eeing what we &s;aw: for, by the light of the lanthorn, we beheld limbs,
<PB N="73" REF="76">
and bones, and human &s;keletons, on every &s;ide of us. I repeat: horror had nothing to add.</P>
<P>The dancing lights we had &s;een, the &s;hrill &s;ignals and the dreadful howls that we had heard, were now no longer thought my&s;terious. It was no <HI>ign's fatuus</HI>; but the lanthorn of the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: no dog or wolf, baying the moon; but the agonizing yells of murder!</P>
<P>The men were four in number. The idea of attacking them &s;everal times &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf. Nor was it &s;o much over-powered by the apprehen&s;ion of the arms with which I concluded &s;uch men mu&s;t be provided, as that my mind was ren|dered irre&s;olute by the dreadful pictures, real and imaginary, which had pa&s;&s;ed through my mind.</P>
<P>Clarke, brave as he was, had lo&s;t all his intrepidity in this golgotha, this place of &s;kulls; the very &s;cent of which, know|ing whence it proceeded, was abhorrent.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="77">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="73" REF="78">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<P><PB N="74" REF="79">No: it was not their arms, nor their numbers, but the&s;e fears that induced me, when he that &s;aw my eyes move was in danger of giving the alarm, to clo&s;e them; and, profiting by the fellow's &s;ympathetic terror, counterfeit the death by which I was environed.</P>
<P>Here then we were. And mu&s;t we here remain? To &s;leep was impo&s;&s;ible. Mu&s;t we ri&s;e and grapple with the dead; trample on their limbs, and &s;tumble over their unearthed bones, in endeavouring to get out?</P>
<P>Neither could we tell what new hor|rors were in &s;tore for us. Who had not heard of trap doors, &s;liding wain&s;cots, and other murderous contrivances? And could they be now forgotten? Impo&s;&s;ible. All the phantoms memory could revive, or fancy could create, were realized and a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>Of the two, I certainly had more the u&s;e of my under&s;tanding than Clarke;
<PB N="75" REF="80">
but I was &s;o ab&s;orbed, in the terrors which a&s;&s;ailed me, on every &s;ide, that I was intent on them only; and forgot, while the lanthorn glimmered its partial and dull rays, to con&s;ider the geography of the place; or to plan the means of e&s;cape, till the moment the men were departing; when I caught a glimp&s;e of what I imagined to be a window facing me.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as our fears would permit us, we began, in low and cautious whi&s;pers, to communicate our thoughts. Clarke was pertinaciou&s;ly aver&s;e to ri&s;e, and hurtle in the dark, with the bones of the dead. By the intervening medium of the &s;traw, he had pu&s;hed away the terrific hand; and was determined, he &s;aid, to lie &s;till; till day-light &s;hould return, and prevent him from treading, at random, on the horrible objects around him; or &s;tumbling over and being &s;tretched upon a corp&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="81">I had as little inclination to come in contact with dead hands, cadaverous bo|dies, and di&s;&s;evered joints, as he could have; yet was too violently tormented to remain quiet, and &s;uffer my&s;elf to be preyed on by my imagination. Had I re&s;igned my&s;elf to it, without endeavour|ing to relieve it by action, it would have driven me frantic. I half ro&s;e, &s;at con|&s;idering, ventured to feel round me and &s;hrunk back with inexpre&s;&s;ible terror, from the fir&s;t object that I touched. Again I ruminated, again ventured to feel, and again and again &s;hivered with horrible apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>U&s;e will reconcile us to all &s;ituations. Experience corrects fear, emboldens ig|norance, and renders de&s;ire adventurous. The builder will walk without dread on the ridge of a hou&s;e: while the timid &s;pectator &s;tanding below is obliged to turn his eyes away, or tumble headlong down and be da&s;hed to pieces in imagi|nation.

Repeated trials had a &s;imilar ef|fect on me: they rendered me more hardy; and I proceeded, as nearly as I could gue&s;s, toward the window; touch|ing, treading on, and encountering, I knew not what; &s;ubject, every moment, to new &s;tarts of terror; and my heart now &s;inking, now leaping, as the &s;udden freaks and frights of fancy &s;eized upon me.</P>
<P>After the departure of the de&s;pera|does, we had heard various noi&s;es, in the adjoining hou&s;e; among others the occa&s;ional ringing of a chamber bell. While I was thus endeavouring to ex|plore my way, arre&s;ted by terror at every &s;tep, as I have been de&s;cribing, we again heard &s;ounds that approached more near|ly; and pre&s;ently the inner-door once more opened, and a livery &s;ervant, bear|ing two lighted candles, came in; fol|lowed by a man with an apron tied round
<PB N="78" REF="83">
him, having a kind of bib up to his chin, and linen &s;leeves drawn over his coat.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter, for &s;o he evidently was, had a meagre, wan, countenance; and a diminutive form. The &s;ervant had evidently &s;ome trepidation.</P>
<P>"Do not be afraid, Matthew," &s;aid the ma&s;ter. "You will &s;oon be accu&s;|tomed to it; and you will then laugh at your pre&s;ent timidity. Unle&s;s you con|quer your fears, you will not be able to obey my directions, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting me; and con&s;equently will not be fit for your place; and you know you cannot get &s;uch good wages in any other."</P>
<P>"I will do my be&s;t, &s;ir," &s;aid the &s;er|vant: "but I can't &s;ay but, for the fir&s;t time, it is a little frightful."</P>
<P>"Mere prejudice, Matthew. I am &s;tudying to gain knowledge, which will be &s;erviceable to mankind: and that you mu&s;t perceive will be doing good."</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="84">"Yes, &s;ir."</P>
<P>"Reach me tho&s;e in&s;truments&mdash;Now, lift up the body; and turn the head a little this way&mdash;Why do you tremble? Are you afraid of the dead?"</P>
<P>"Not much, &s;ir."</P>
<P>"Lift boldly, then."</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;ir."</P>
<P>As the &s;ervant turned round, half &s;tu|pefied with his fears, he beheld me &s;tand|ing with my eyes fixed, watchful and li&s;|tening with my whole &s;oul, for the in|terpretation of the&s;e enigmas. The man &s;tared, gaped, turned pale, and at la&s;t dropped down; overcome with his ter|rors.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter was amazed; and, per|ceiving which way the &s;ervant's attention had been directed, looked round. His eye caught mine. He &s;tood motionle&s;s. His pale face a&s;&s;umed a death-like hue; and, for a few moments, he &s;eemed to want the power of utterance.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85">Clarke had remained, a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded, a &s;ilent &s;pectator of the &s;cene. But there was now light; and, though the objects of horror were mul|tiplied in reality, they were le&s;s nume|rous to the imagination. Seeing the fear of the &s;ervant, ob&s;erving his fall, and re|marking the gentle and feeble appear|ance of the ma&s;ter, armed though he was with murderous in&s;truments, Clarke was now ri&s;ing; determined to come to ac|tion. His proceeding di&s;turbed our mu|tual amazement. He was on his legs; and, as I perceived, advancing with ho&s;|tile intentions.</P>
<P>The dialogue I had heard, and the ob|jects which I had di&s;tinctly &s;een and ex|amined, had, by this time, unravelled the whole my&s;tery. I di&s;covered that we were in the di&s;&s;ecting-room of an anato|mi&s;t. Clarke was clenching his fi&s;t and preparing to direct a blow at the opera|tor; and I had but ju&s;t time to &s;tep for|ward,
<PB N="81" REF="86">
arre&s;t his arm, and impede its pro|gre&s;s. "Be quiet," &s;aid I, "Clarke; we have been mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake, who are you, gen|tlemen?" &s;aid the owner of the man|&s;ion: recovered in part from his appre|hen&s;ions, by my pacific interference.</P>
<P>"We are benighted travellers, &s;ir," an|&s;wered I; "who got entrance into this place by accident; and have our&s;elves been &s;uffering under fal&s;e, but exce&s;&s;ive, fear. Pray, &s;ir, be under no alarm; for we are far from intending you injury."</P>
<P>He made no immediate reply, and I continued.</P>
<P>"Fear, I find, though &s;he has indeed a mo&s;t active fancy, has no under&s;tand|ing: otherwi&s;e, among the innumerable conjectures with which my brain has been bu&s;ied within this hour, the truth would certainly have &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf. But, in|&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing I was tran&s;ported to the benignant regions of &s;cience, I
<PB N="82" REF="87">
thought my&s;elf certain of being in the purlieus of the damned; in the very den of murder."</P>
<P>My language, manner, and tone of voice, relieved him from all alarm; and he &s;aid, with a &s;mile, "This is a very whim&s;ical accident."</P>
<P>"You would think &s;o, indeed, &s;ir," replied I, "if you knew but half of the horrible images on which we have been dreaming. But it was di&s;tre&s;s that drove us to take &s;helter here; and if there be any village, or if not, even any barn, in which we could take a little re&s;t till day|light, we &s;hould be exceedingly obliged to you for that kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance which, from your love of &s;cience, and from the remarks I have heard you make to your &s;ervant, I am per&s;uaded, you will be very willing to afford."</P>
<P>By this time, the &s;ervant was reco|vered from his fright; and on his legs. "Go, Matthew," &s;aid the ma&s;ter, "and
<PB N="83" REF="88">
call up one of the maids." And turning to me he added, "Be kind enough to follow me, &s;ir, with your companion. I doubt if you could procure either lodging or refre&s;hment, within three miles of the place; and I &s;hall therefore be very hap|py in &s;upplying you with both."</P>
<P>We obeyed; I highly delighted with the benevolent and ho&s;pitable manner of our ho&s;t; and Clarke mo&s;t glad to e&s;cape, from a &s;cene which no explana|tion had yet reconciled to his feelings, or notions of good and evil.</P>

<P>A REVIEW OF EMOTIONS AND MISTAKES. RE|PO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> AFTER FATIGUE. SINGULAR THOUGHTS CONCERNING PROPERTY. BENEVOLENCE ON A LARGE SCALE.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the relation of this adventure, I have given a picture, not of things as they were afterward di&s;covered to be, but, as they appeared to us at the time; reflect|ed through the medium of con&s;ternation and terror. We had been powerfully prepared for the&s;e, by the previous cir|cum&s;tances. Our imaginations had been &s;trongly preyed upon by our di&s;tre&s;s, by the accidents of falling, and by the min|gled noi&s;es we had heard: proceeding from the church-yard robbers, from the
<PB N="85" REF="90">
village-dogs and curs di&s;turbed by them and us, and from the whi&s;tling roaring and howling which are &s;o common to high gu&s;ts of wind; and &s;o almo&s;t di&s;|tracting to a mind already in a &s;tate of vi&s;ionary deception and alarm. There was indeed enough to excite that wild and uncontroulable dread, which ru&s;hed upon us every moment. Mingled as they were with darkne&s;s, ignorance, and confu&s;ion, the &s;ucceeding objects were actually horrible.</P>
<P>Thus the di&s;cour&s;e and dialect, as well as the voices, of the men employed to furni&s;h dead bodies, were gro&s;s and rude; and the timidity and prejudices of tho&s;e, who probably were young in the em|ployment, contra&s;ted with the jokes, vul|gar &s;arca&s;ms, and oaths, of the boi&s;terous and hardened adepts, though habitual to &s;uch people, gave a colouring to the pre|ceding circum&s;tances, that &s;o confirmed and realized our fears as not to allow us
<PB N="86" REF="91">
the lei&s;ure to doubt. To repeat &s;uch coar&s;e colloquies and vulgar ribaldry is no plea&s;ing ta&s;k; except as a hi&s;tory of the manners of &s;uch men, and of the emotions with which on this occa&s;ion they were accompanied. The&s;e indeed made the repetition nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e true that, in their own opinion, the&s;e men were more or le&s;s criminal: and guilt always a&s;&s;umes an audacity, and fiercene&s;s, which it does not feel. They were not intentionally acting well: but were doing that which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be a deed of de&s;perate wickedne&s;s, for &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es. Had the con&s;ent of any one of them when dying been a&s;ked, to have his body dug up and di&s;&s;ected, he would have heard the propo&s;al with dete&s;tation. Con&s;equently, they deceived us the more effectually: for they had the manners of that guilt which, as far as intention was concerned, they actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="92">Add to this the &s;pectacle of a di&s;&s;ect|ing-room; &s;een indi&s;tinctly by the par|tial glimmerings of a lanthorn. Who|ever has been in &s;uch a place will recog|ni&s;e the picture. Here preparations of arms, pendent in rows, with the ve&s;&s;els injected. There legs, feet, and other limbs. In this place the inte&s;tines: in that membranes, cartilages, mu&s;cles, with the bones and all their varieties of cloth|ing, in every imaginary mangled form. The&s;e things ought not to be terrible: but to per&s;ons of little reflection, and not familiarized to them, they always are.</P>
<P>E&s;caped from this &s;cene, re&s;tored as it were to human intercour&s;e, and encou|raged by the kindne&s;s of our ho&s;t, who&s;e name was Evelyn, our pul&s;e began to grow temperate; and our imaginations to relax and gravitate toward common &s;en&s;e. We took the refre&s;hment that was brought us, and conver&s;ed during
<PB N="88" REF="93">
the meal with Mr. Evelyn: partly on the incidents of the night, and partly in an&s;wering a few que&s;tions; which he put with a feeling that denoted a de&s;ire ra|ther to afford us aid than to gratify his own curio&s;ity. After which, as we were weary and he di&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue his noc|turnal re&s;earches, we immediately retired to re&s;t. Clarke was full to overflowing with cogitation: but, fro the pre&s;ent, it was too large, or rather too confu&s;ed, for utterance; and it &s;oon overpowered and &s;unk him into &s;leep.</P>
<P>For my own part, my mind was too much alive to be immediately overcome by fatigue. I lay revolving in thought the incidents of the night; which led me into reveries on the &s;ingular character of Mr. Evelyn, on my own forlorn &s;tate, on the bleak pro&s;pect before me, and on Olivia.</P>
<P>This la&s;t train of thinking was not ea|&s;ily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. At length, however, both
<PB N="89" REF="94">
mind and body were &s;o overwearied that I fell into an unu&s;ually profound &s;leep; from which I did not awake till Clarke, who had ri&s;en two hours before, came between nine and ten o'clock and rouzed me, to inform me that breakfa&s;t was waiting, and that our ho&s;t expected my company.</P>
<P>While I was dre&s;&s;ing, he told me that Mr. Evelyn had been making many en|quiries concerning me; and apologized him&s;elf, with marks of apprehen&s;ion le&s;t he &s;hould have done wrong, while he owned that he had an&s;wered the&s;e inter|rogatories, by relating &s;uch particulars as he knew.</P>
<P>We then went down; and, among other conver&s;ation at breakfa&s;t, Mr. Eve|lyn remarked that he under&s;tood, from Clarke, we had no urgent bu&s;ine&s;s which would make a day &s;ooner or a day later of any material con&s;equence; and he therefore particularly reque&s;ted we would
<PB N="90" REF="95">
delay our departure till the next morn|ing. The rea&s;on he gave was a kind ex|pre&s;&s;ion of intere&s;t, which what he had heard from my companion had excited; and a de&s;ire, not of inqui&s;itive prying but evidently of benevolence, to be as fully informed of my hi&s;tory as I &s;hould think proper to make him.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;oothing both in the reque&s;t and in his manner, which induced me to readily comply. Poor Clarke excepted, I &s;eemed as if no hu|man being took any concern in my fate; and to di&s;cover that there was yet a man who was capable of &s;ympathizing with me was like filling a painful vacancy of the heart, and afforded &s;omething of an incoherent hope of relief.</P>
<P>Not that I was prepared to a&s;k or even to accept favours. I had rather entertained a kind of indignant &s;en&s;e of injury, again&s;t any one who &s;hould pre&s;ume to make me his debtor: or to &s;uppo&s;e I was inca|pable
<PB N="91" REF="96">
of not rather enduring all extre|mities than &s;o to &s;ubject and degrade my&s;elf as, in my own apprehen&s;ion, I &s;hould do by any &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, Mr. Evelyn de&s;ired me to walk with him; that we might con|ver&s;e the more freely when alone. He then repeated what Clarke had told him, gave a &s;trong and affecting picture of the overflowing kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion with which my companion had related all he knew, and proceeded afterward to &s;peak of him&s;elf in the following terms.</P>
<P>"I am a man, Mr. Trevor, engaged in a tru&s;t which I find it very difficult con|&s;cientiou&s;ly to di&s;charge. I have an e&s;|tate of fifteen hundred a year, and am a creature who&s;e real wants, like tho&s;e of other human creatures, are few. I live here &s;urrounded by &s;ome hundreds of acres; &s;tored with fruits, corn, and cat|tle; which the laws and cu&s;toms of na|tions call mine. But what is it that the&s;e
<PB N="92" REF="97">
laws and cu&s;toms mean? That I am to devour the whole produce of thus much land? The thing is impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Why impo&s;&s;ible? You may con|vert a hundred head of oxen into a &s;er|vice of gold plate. Liveries, laces, equi|page, gilding, garni&s;hing, and ten thou|&s;and other modes or fa&s;hionable wants, which if not gratified render tho&s;e that have them mi&s;erable, would eat up all that ten thou&s;and acres, if you had them, could yield. Are you an Epicure? You may &s;o &s;tew, di&s;till, and titillate your pa|late with e&s;&s;ences that a hecatomb &s;hall be &s;wallowed at every meal. The means of devouring are innumerable, and ju&s;ti|fied by general u&s;age."</P>
<P>"General u&s;age may be an apology, but not a ju&s;tification. Happine&s;s is the end of man: but it cannot be &s;ingle. On the contrary, the more beings are happy the greater is the individual happine&s;s of each: for each is a being of &s;ympathies,
<PB N="93" REF="98">
and affections; which are increa&s;ed by being called into action. It is the mi|&s;erable mechani&s;m of &s;ociety which, by giving legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what is called property to the holders, puts it ab&s;olutely and unconditionally in their di&s;po&s;al."</P>
<P>"Why the mi&s;erable mcchani&s;m? Are you a friend to the Agrarian &s;y&s;tem?"</P>
<P>"By no means. I was incorrect: The mechani&s;m is defective enough, but I rather meant to have &s;aid the mi&s;erable moral &s;y&s;tem of &s;ociety; which allows every man to exerci&s;e his own caprice, and thinks him guilty of no crime though he is in the daily habit of wa&s;ting that which might render numbers happy, who are in ab&s;olute want."</P>
<P>"This is an evil of which the world has for ages been complaining: but for which I &s;ee no remedy."</P>
<P>"You mean no remedy which laws or governments, by the inflicting of pains
<PB N="94" REF="99">
and penalties, can afford: at which, to do them ju&s;tice, they have been much too often aiming; but have as continu|ally failed."</P>
<P>"And you imagine, &s;ir, you are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a more effectual pre&s;cription?</P>
<P>"I dare not pre&s;cribe: it would be an arrogant a&s;&s;umption of wi&s;dom. But I may advi&s;e a regimen which has nume|rous probabilities in its favour. Yet what I mu&s;t advi&s;e has been &s;o many thou&s;and times advi&s;ed before that it &s;eems imper|tinence to repeat it; if not mockery. To tell the rich that they &s;eek enjoyment where it is not to be found, that the pa|rade by which they torment them&s;elves to gain di&s;tinction renders them &s;upreme|ly ridiculous, that their follies, while they are oppre&s;&s;ive and hateful to the poor, are the topics of contempt and &s;candal even in their own circles, and that the repe|tition of them inevitably proves that they
<PB N="95" REF="100">
bring wearine&s;s, di&s;gu&s;t, ruin, pain, and every human mi&s;ery, is mere common-place declamation.</P>
<P>"But there is one truth of which they have not been &s;ufficiently reminded. They are not, as they have too long been taught to &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves, placed be|yond the cen&s;ure of the multitude. It is found that the multitude can think, and have di&s;covered that the u&s;e the wealthy too often make of what they call their own is unju&s;t, tyrannical, and de|&s;tructive.</P>
<P>"This memento will come to them with the greater force the oftener they are made to recollect that the &s;pirit of enquiry is abroad, that their voluptuous wa&s;te is daily becoming more odious, and that &s;implicity of manners, a bene|volent oeconomy, a vigorous munifi|cence, and a comprehen&s;ive philanthro|py, can alone redeem them; and pre|&s;erve that &s;ocial order which every lover
<PB N="96" REF="101">
of the human race delights to contem|plate, but of which they arrogate to them&s;elves the merit of being the &s;ole advocates.</P>
<P>"It is the moral &s;y&s;tem of &s;ociety that wants reform. This cannot be &s;uddenly produced, nor by the efforts of any indi|vidual: but it may be progre&s;&s;ive, and every individual may contribute: though &s;ome much more powerfully than others. The rich, in proportion as they &s;hall un|der&s;tand this power and the&s;e duties, will become peculiarly in&s;trumental: for po|verty, by being &s;ubjected to continual labour, is nece&s;&s;arily ignorant; and it is well known how dangerous it is for igno|rance to turn reformer.</P>
<P>"Let the rich therefore awake: let them encourage each other to quit their pernicious frivolities, and to enquire, without fear or prejudice, how they may &s;ecure tranquillity and promote happine&s;s; and let them thus avert tho&s;e mi&s;eries at
<PB N="97" REF="102">
which they &s;o loudly and &s;o bitterly rail, but into which by their conduct a majo|rity of them is &s;o ready to plunge.</P>
<P>"The intentions of tho&s;e among them who think the mo&s;t are excellent: to a&s;&s;ert the contrary is equally fal&s;e and ab&s;urd. But, when they expect to pro|mote peace and order by irritating each other again&s;t this or that cla&s;s of men, however mi&s;taken tho&s;e men may be, and by di&s;&s;eminating a mutual &s;pirit of acrimony between them&s;elves and their opponents, they act like madmen; and, if they do not grow calm, forgiving, and kind, the increa&s;ing fury of the mad ma|ny will overtake them."</P>
<P>"They are like the brethren of Dives they pay but little regard to Mo&s;es and the prophets."</P>
<P>"Well, Mr. Trevor, you will own at lea&s;t that, &s;ince I can talk with all this &s;eeming wi&s;dom, a &s;mall &s;hare of the prac|tice
<PB N="98" REF="103">
will be becoming in me; and what you and all mankind would expect."</P>
<P>"I may: but not all mankind. There are &s;ome who pretend to be &s;o learned, in what they call the depravity of human nature, that, after having heard you &s;peak thus admirably in favour of virtue, they would think it more than an equal chance that you are one of the wickede&s;t of men."</P>
<P>"Oh, with re&s;pect to that, &s;ome of my very neighbours do not &s;cruple to affirm that I am &s;o. But, I repeat, I have what I con&s;ider as a large e&s;tate in tru&s;t; and it is a &s;erious and a &s;acred duty impo&s;ed upon me to &s;eek how it may be be&s;t em|ployed. I &s;eldom am &s;atisfied with the means which offer them&s;elves; and am therefore always in que&s;t of new."</P>
<P>"I wonder at that, &s;ir, with your &s;y&s;|tem. Have you no poor in the country?"</P>
<P>"O yes: enough to grieve any pene|trable heart. But I know no ta&s;k more
<PB N="99" REF="104">
difficult than that of admini&s;tering to their wants, without encouraging their vices. Of the&s;e wants I con&s;ider in&s;truc|tion as the greate&s;t; and to that I pay the greate&s;t attention. Food, cloathing, and di&s;ea&s;e are imperious nece&s;&s;ities; and to leave them unprovided would be guilt incredible to &s;peculation, did we not &s;ee it in hourly practice. But the poor are &s;o mi&s;led, by the opinions they are taught to hold and the oppre&s;&s;ions to which they are &s;ubject, that, by relieving the&s;e mo&s;t urgent wants we are in danger of teaching them idlene&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, and &s;ervility. I do them the little good that I can, mo&s;t willingly: but I con&s;ider the diffu&s;ion of knowledge, by which that which I call the moral &s;y&s;tem of mankind is to be improved, as the mo&s;t effectual means of conferring happine&s;s. Are you of that opinion?"</P>
<P>"I certainly am."</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105">"Then I cannot but think you intend to promote this beneficial plan."</P>
<P>"I &s;carcely know my own intentions. They are un&s;ettled, incoherent, and the dreams of delirium; rather than the &s;y&s;|tem of a &s;age, &s;uch as you have ima|gined."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h we had been longer acquaint|ed and were intimate enough to induce you to relate your hi&s;tory, and confide your thoughts to me, as to a friend; or, if you plea&s;e, as to one who holds it a duty to offer aid, whenever he imagines it will an&s;wer a good end."</P>
<P>"To offer aid is kind: but there are very few ca&s;es in which he that receives it is not mean and degraded. You how|ever are actuated by a generous &s;pirit; and, as you are inclined to li&s;ten, I will very willingly inform you of the chief incidents of a life that has already been con&s;iderably checkered, and the fu|ture
<PB N="101" REF="106">
pro&s;pects of which are &s;ufficiently gloomy."</P>
<P>After this preface, I began my narra|tive; and &s;uccinctly related the principal of tho&s;e events with which the reader already is acquainted. Nor did the &s;tate of my feelings and the &s;trong &s;en&s;e of injury which was ever pre&s;ent to my ima|gination, when I came to recapitulate my adventures &s;ince I fir&s;t left college, &s;uffer me to colour with a negligent or a feeble hand.</P>
<P>Some of the incidents nece&s;&s;arily in|duced me to mention Olivia, and betray my &s;entiments in part: which the que&s;|tions of Mr. Evelyn, put with kindne&s;s, delicacy, and intere&s;t that was evidently unaffected, induced me at length wholly to reveal, with all the tenderne&s;s and the vehemence of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was encouraged or rather impelled to this confidence by the emotions which Mr. Evelyn betrayed, in his countenance,
<PB N="102" REF="107">
voice, and manner. His hopes, his fears, and his affections, were &s;o much in uni|&s;on with my own, his eye &s;o often gli&s;t|ened and his cheek &s;o frequently glowed, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the heart not to open all its rece&s;&s;es, and pour out not only its complaints but its very follies.</P>
<P>Of all the plea&s;ures in which the &s;oul of man mo&s;t delights that of &s;ympathy is &s;urely the chief. It can unite and mingle not only two but ten millions of &s;pirits as one. Could a world be &s;pectators of the &s;orrows of Lear, a world would with one con&s;ent participate in them: &s;o om|nipotent is the power of &s;ympathy. It is the con&s;olation of poverty, it is the cordial of friend&s;hip, it is the e&s;&s;ence of love. Pride and &s;u&s;picion are its chief enemies; and they are the vices that en|gender the mo&s;t baneful of the mi&s;eries of man.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn remained, after I had ended, for &s;ome time in deep meditation;
<PB N="103" REF="108">
now and then ca&s;ting his eyes toward me and then taking them away, as if fearful of offending my &s;en&s;ibility and again fall|ing into thought. At length, fixing them more firmly and with an open benignity of countenance, he thus broke &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"I have been devi&s;ing, my noble young friend, allow me to call you &s;o, by what means I &s;hould be&s;t make my&s;elf under|&s;tood to you; and how mo&s;t effectually prevail on you to contribute to my hap|pine&s;s, and to tho&s;e great ends for which &s;ouls of ardour like yours are &s;o highly gifted. I have already &s;ketched my principles, concerning the u&s;e and abu&s;e of property. One of tho&s;e rare occa&s;ions on which it may be excellently employed now pre&s;ents it&s;elf. You are in pur&s;uit of &s;cience, by which a world is to be im|proved. To the be&s;t of my ability I fol|low the &s;ame track: but I have the means, which you want. You have too little: I have too much. It is my pro|vince,
<PB N="104" REF="109">
and, if you con&s;ent, as I hope and tru&s;t you will, it will be my &s;upreme plea&s;ure to &s;upply the deficiency. I am acquainted with the delicacy of your &s;en|timents: but I am likewi&s;e acquainted with the expan&s;ion of your heart, and with its power of ri&s;ing &s;uperior to the fal&s;e di&s;tinctions which at pre&s;ent regulate &s;ociety. I might a&s;&s;ume the &s;evere tone of the morali&s;t, and urge your compli|ance with my reque&s;t as a duty: but I would rather indulge what may perhaps be the foible of immature virtue, and follow the affectionate impul&s;e which binds me to you as my friend and bro|ther. Be&s;ide the&s;e are vibrations with which I am per&s;uaded your warm and kindred heart will more readily har|monize. In youth, we willingly obey impetuous &s;en&s;ations: but reluctantly li&s;ten to the flow and frigid deductions of rea&s;on, when they are in contradiction to our habits and prejudices. I therefore
<PB N="105" REF="110">
repeat, you are my friend and brother; and I conjure you, by tho&s;e generous and magnanimous feelings of which your whole life proves you are &s;o eminently &s;u&s;ceptible, not to wound me by refu&s;al. Do not con&s;ider me as the acquaintance of a day; for, by hearing your hi&s;tory, I have travelled with you through life, and &s;eem as if I had been the inmate of your bo&s;om even from your years of in|fancy. No: far from being &s;trangers, we have been imbibing &s;imilar principles, &s;imilar views, and &s;imilar affections. Our &s;ouls have communed for years, and re|joice that the time at length is come in which that individual intercour&s;e for which they may mo&s;t ju&s;tly be &s;aid to have panted is opened. If you object, if you he&s;itate, if you &s;u&s;pect me, you will annihilate the pure&s;t &s;en&s;ations which the&s;e &s;ouls have mutually cheri&s;hed: you will wrong both your&s;elf and me."</P>
<P>There was an emanating fervor in the
<PB N="106" REF="111">
look, deportment, and the very ge&s;tures, of Mr. Evelyn that was irre&s;i&s;tible. It &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his language. It led me out of my&s;elf. It hurried me beyond the narrow limits of prejudices and prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and tran&s;ported me wherever it plea&s;ed. I was no longer in mortal &s;o|ciety; &s;urrounded by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, cun|ning, and cowardly &s;u&s;picions. He had borne me on his wings, and &s;eated me among the Gods; who&s;e mini&s;ters were wi&s;dom and beneficence. I bur&s;t into exclamation.</P>
<P>"I own it, you are my friend! you are my brother! I accept your offers, I will receive your benefits, but I will re|taliate."</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed. I felt the egoti&s;m of my own thoughts, but could not &s;ubdue the torrent. I continued inwardly to vow, with the mo&s;t vehement a&s;&s;everations, that I would repay every mark of kind|ne&s;s he &s;hould be&s;tow fifty fold. The
<PB N="107" REF="112">
heart of man will not re&s;t &s;atisfied with inferiority, and has recour&s;e to a thou|&s;and &s;tratagems, a thou&s;and deceptions, to relieve it&s;elf of any &s;uch doubts; which it entertains with impatience, and pain.</P>
<P>My own enthu&s;ia&s;m however was &s;oon inclined to &s;ub&s;ide; and I became ready to tax my&s;elf with that meanne&s;s and de|gradation which I had felt, and expre&s;&s;ed, at the beginning of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Of this the quick penetration of Mr. Evelyn &s;eemed to be aware; and he &s;o effectu|ally counteracted the&s;e emotions that, at length, I abandoned all thoughts of re|&s;i&s;tance; or of betraying tho&s;e jealou&s;ies which would now have appeared almo&s;t in&s;ulting, to a man who had di&s;played a &s;pirit &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject being as it were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, our conver&s;ation recurred to my pre&s;ent affairs, and future pro&s;pects; and, while we di&s;cour&s;ed on the&s;e, that which might
<PB N="108" REF="113">
well at this period be called the malady of my mind exhibited it&s;elf. Though I had as it were lo&s;t &s;ight of Olivia, though I knew not but &s;he might at that time be a wife, and though, whatever her condition might be, I had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to fear that if &s;he thought of me it was with pain, not with love, &s;till that &s;he mu&s;t and &s;hould be mine was a kind of frantic con|clu&s;ion with which I always con&s;oled my&s;elf. But for this purpo&s;e riches pre|&s;ented them&s;elves as of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity; and riches them&s;elves would be u&s;ele&s;s, unle&s;s obtained with the rapidity rather of enchantment than by the ordinary progre&s;s of human events.</P>
<P>I did not conceal this weakne&s;s from my friend, and ventured to propo&s;e a plan on which I had previou&s;ly been ruminating; though I had fore&s;een no means of putting it in practice. Every man had heard of the fortunes acquired in the ea&s;t, and of the wealth which had
<PB N="109" REF="114" MS="y">
been poured from the lap of India. The army there was at all times open to men like my&s;elf; youthful, healthy, and of education. 'Tis true I had been of opi|nion that there were &s;trong moral ob|jections to this profe&s;&s;ion: but the&s;e my more prevalent pa&s;&s;ions had lulled me into a forgetfulne&s;s of, and I &s;tated this as the mo&s;t probable &s;cheme for the ac|compli&s;hment of my deare&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn, anxious not to wound me where I was mo&s;t vulnerable, began by &s;oothing my ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and then proceeded to detail the phy&s;ical chances of a ruined con&s;titution, of death, and of failure; and afterward to repre&s;ent, with una&s;&s;uming but with &s;tedfa&s;t energy, the moral turpitude fir&s;t of &s;ubjecting my&s;elf to the phy&s;ical evils he had recited, and next of hiring my&s;elf to enmity again&s;t nations I had never known, and of be|coming the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of people whom I had never &s;een, and who had not had any
<PB N="110" REF="115">
po&s;&s;ible opportunity of doing me an in|jury, or even of giving me an offence.</P>
<P>The objections I &s;tarted, partly to defend the opinions I had begun with, and partly becau&s;e I felt my&s;elf loth to relinqui&s;h a plan by which my imagina|tion had been flattered, &s;oon became very feeble: but the intere&s;ting nature of the &s;ubject prolonged the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion till it was nearly dinner time.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this enquiry, Mr. Evelyn delineated the contemptible yet ridiculous arts which are employed to en|trap men into the military &s;ervice; pour|trayed the inevitable depravity of their morals, and gave a hi&s;tory of the feelings worthy of fiends which are engendered, while they are trained to fix their bayo|nets, load their pieces, level them, di&s;|charge them at men they had never &s;een before, &s;trike off the heads of the&s;e &s;tran|gers with furious dexterity, &s;tab the ground in full gallop on which they are
<PB N="111" REF="116">
&s;uppo&s;ed to have fallen and to lie help|le&s;s, and commit habitual and innume|rable murders in imagination, that they may be hardened for actual &s;laughter.</P>
<P>He afterward gave an enlightened and animated &s;ketch of the abject condition of tho&s;e who command the&s;e men, of the total re&s;ignation which each makes of his under&s;tanding to that of the next in rank above him, and of the arrogant, the igno|rant, the turbulent, the dangerous and the &s;lavi&s;h &s;pirit which this begets. He fini&s;hed the picture with a recapitulation of the innumerable and horrid mi&s;eries which everla&s;tingly mark the progre&s;s of war; which he painted with &s;uch force and truth that I recoiled from the con|templation of it with abhorrence.</P>
<P>My feelings had been &s;o agitated by this di&s;cour&s;e that my imagination was thoroughly rouzed. My former ideas, concerning the enormous vices of war, had not only been revived but increa&s;ed;
<PB N="112" REF="117">
and, though I began with debating the que&s;tion, I &s;oon cea&s;ed to oppo&s;e: &s;o that my thoughts were rather bu&s;ied in filling up the picture, and collecting all its hor|rors, than in apologizing for or denying their exi&s;tence. This was the temper of mind in which Mr. Evelyn, attending to his own concerns, left me for a &s;hort time; and my heart was &s;o agonized by the recollection that this was a &s;y&s;tem to which men were &s;till devoted, and of which they were &s;till in the headlong and hot pur&s;uit, that I then immediately, and perhaps with le&s;s effort than I ever made on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, produced the fol|lowing poem:

I was too full of my &s;ubject, and poet like too much delighted with the ver&s;es I had &s;o &s;uddenly produced, not to &s;hew them immediately to Mr. Evelyn.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to do them even more than ju&s;tice: he read them again and again, and each time with a feeling now of compa&s;&s;ion, now of amazement, and now of horror, that &s;hewed how &s;trongly
<PB N="115" REF="120">
the picture had &s;eized upon his &s;oul. The a&s;&s;ociations of mi&s;ery which his ima|gination added were &s;o forcible that tears repeatedly rolled down his cheeks. To this more &s;oothing trains of thought &s;uc|ceeded. The pain of the pa&s;t and the pre&s;ent was alleviated by a pro&s;pect of futurity. Our minds ro&s;e to a &s;tate of mutual rapture, excited by a fore&s;ight that the time was at length come in which men were awakening to a comprehen&s;ive view of their own mad and de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tems; that their vices began to be on the decline and no longer to be mi&s;taken for the mo&s;t &s;plendid virtues, as they had formerly been; and that truth was breaking forth upon the world with mo&s;t animating force and vigour.</P>
<P>There have been few moments of my life in which I have experienced intel|lectual enjoyment with a plea&s;ure &s;o exqui&s;ite. Clarke him&s;elf, unu&s;ed as his thoughts had been to explore the future and wre&s;t happine&s;s to them&s;elves by an|ticipation,
<PB N="116" REF="121">
partook of our emotions; and &s;eemed in a &s;tate &s;imilar to tho&s;e religious converts who imagine they feel that a new light is broke in upon them. It was a happy afternoon! It was a type of tho&s;e which &s;hall hereafter be the &s;ub|&s;titutes of the wretched re&s;ources of drinking, ob&s;cene conver&s;ation, and games of chance, to which men have had re|cour&s;e that they might rouze their minds: being rather willing to &s;uffer the extremes of mi&s;ery than that dullne&s;s, and inanity, which they find &s;till more in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>This incident united me and Mr. Evelyn more intimately, and powerfully, than all that had pa&s;&s;ed. The warmth with which he &s;poke, of the benefits that &s;ociety mu&s;t receive from talents like mine, dilated my heart. Every man is better acquainted with his own powers and virtues than any other can po&s;&s;ibly be; and, when they are di&s;covered, ac|knowledged, and applauded, in&s;tead of being denied or overlooked as is more
<PB N="117" REF="122">
generally the ca&s;e, the plea&s;ure he re|ceives is as great as it is unu&s;ual.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation after dinner reverted to the plans I was to pur&s;ue. The law nece&s;&s;arily came under con&s;ideration; and Mr. Evelyn, not having con&s;idered the &s;ubject under the &s;ame points of view as Turl had done, was &s;trongly in favour of that profe&s;&s;ion. He fore&s;aw in me a future Judge, who&s;e integrity &s;hould benefit and who&s;e wi&s;dom &s;hould en|lighten mankind. He conceived there could be no function more honourable, more &s;acred, or more beneficial. An upright judge, with his own pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices &s;ubdued, attentive to the prin|ciples of ju&s;tice by which alone the hap|pine&s;s of the world can be promoted, and by the rectitude of his deci&s;ions affording precedent and example to fu|ture generations, he con&s;idered as a cha|racter that mu&s;t command the reverence and love of the human race.</P>
<P>My imagination while he &s;poke was
<PB N="118" REF="123">
not idle. It helped to fill up the picture. It placed me on the judgment &s;eat. It gave me the penetration of Solomon, the benevolence of Zalcucus, and the legi&s;|lative &s;oul of Alfred. As u&s;ual, it over|&s;tepped the probable with wonderful ca&s;e and celerity. Not only the objec|tions of Turl di&s;appeared, but the jargon of the law, its voluminous lumber with which I had been di&s;gu&s;ted when read|ing the civilians at college, and all my other doubts and di&s;gu&s;ts, vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>Our inquiries accordingly ended with a determination that I &s;hould continue my journey to town, &s;hould keep my terms at the Temple, and &s;hould place my&s;elf, as is cu&s;tomary, under one of the mo&s;t eminent barri&s;ters.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;arily brought me to con|&s;ider the expence; and the moment that &s;ubject recurred I felt all the pain which could not but a&s;&s;ault a mind like mine. I had nurtured, not only the haughtine&s;s of independance, but the &s;uppo&s;ition that,
<PB N="119" REF="124">
in my own extraordinary powers and gifts, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed innumerable re&s;ources; and, at moments, had encouraged tho&s;e many extravagant flights with which the reader is already well acquainted.</P>
<P>However, after all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and for the rea&s;ons that had been &s;uffi|ciently urged, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub|mit: though by the conce&s;&s;ion my &s;oul &s;eemed to be &s;ubdued, and its faculties to be &s;hrunk and half withered. It was an oppre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ation that could not be &s;haken off, yet that mu&s;t be endured. Such at lea&s;t was my pre&s;ent conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the evening, Mr. Evelyn at my reque&s;t &s;tated his rea&s;ons for pur&s;uing his own cour&s;e of &s;tudies; and in&s;tanced a variety of facts which convinced me of the benefits to be deri|ved from the &s;cience of &s;urgery, of the ra&s;h conclu&s;ions to which modern theo|ri&s;ts and enquirers have been led, and of the nece&s;&s;ity there is that &s;ome practi|tioner, equally well informed with them|&s;elves
<PB N="120" REF="125">
but aware of the evil of fal&s;e de|ductions, &s;hould demon&s;trate the mi&s;chief of ha&s;ty a&s;&s;ertion, and that things which are only conjectural ought not to be given as indubitable.</P>
<P>Of this nature he con&s;idered their hy|pothe&s;es relating to the brain, the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem, the lymphatic fluid, and other &s;ubjects; concerning which many curious but hitherto equivocal facts have been the di&s;covery of modern re&s;earch.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn not only read all the be&s;t authors, but went to London, every win|ter, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly maintained an inter|cour&s;e with the mo&s;t able men, attended their lectures, was pre&s;ent at their opera|tions, and fully informed him&s;elf of their differences both in opinion and practice.</P>
<P>But his frame was delicate, a too long abode in London always occa&s;ioned pul|monary &s;ymptoms, and experience taught him that his native air was more healthful and animating than any other. The difficulties attending his &s;tudies were
<PB N="121" REF="126">
greatly increa&s;ed by his re&s;idence in the country; but they were &s;urmounted by his precaution, and by the general favour which his benevolence &s;ecured to him among the neighbouring people. Though there were not wanting &s;ome who con|&s;idered him as a very &s;trange, if not a dangerous and a wicked, man.</P>
<P>It is a curious yet an a&s;toni&s;hing and an afflicting &s;peculation that men &s;hould be mo&s;t prone to &s;u&s;pect, and hate, tho&s;e who are mo&s;t unwearied in endeavouring to remove their evils. That a &s;urgeon mu&s;t be acquainted with the direction, &s;ite, and properties, of the mu&s;cles, arteries, ligaments, nerves, and other parts, before he can cut the living body with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible injury, and that this knowledge can only be acquired by experience, is a very plain propo&s;ition. It is equally &s;elf-evident that a dead body is no longer &s;ubject to pain; and that it certainly cannot be more di&s;graced by
<PB N="122" REF="127">
the knife of a &s;urgeon than by the gnaw|ing of worms. When will men &s;hake off their infantine terrors, and their idiot-like prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE DEPARTURE. EJACULATIONS. PRESENT PLEA|SURES AND FUTURE HOPES. A STRANGE DIA|LOGUE IN THE DARK; AND A GENEROUS AND BEAUTIFUL DEFENDER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE plea&s;ure I this day received in the company of Mr. Evelyn was uncommon, the friend&s;hip with which he had in&s;pired me was pure, and the re&s;pect that my heart paid to his virtues was profound. But eagerne&s;s of pur&s;uit was my charac|teri&s;tic. My plan being formed, every moment of delay would have been tor|ment; and he, entering into all my thoughts and &s;ympathi&s;ing with all my wi&s;hes, prompted me to follow my bent.
<PB N="123" REF="128">
It was therefore agreed that I and my companion &s;hould depart by one of the coaches which would pa&s;s an inn at &s;ome di&s;tance in the morning. A me&s;&s;enger was accordingly di&s;patched to take places in the fir&s;t vacant coach, arrangements for money-matters were made with every po&s;&s;ible delicacy by my friend, the night pa&s;&s;ed away, day returned, and we de|parted.</P>
<P>I will leave the reader to image to him|&s;elf the crowding &s;en&s;ations that pre&s;&s;ed upon my heart on this occa&s;ion, the tu|mult of thought which incidents &s;o &s;ud|den and unexpected produced, and the feelings which mutually pa&s;&s;ed between me and my noble benefactor. I &s;hall live, &s;aid I, to acknowledge this in my old age. I &s;hall have a &s;tory to tell, a man to de&s;cribe, and a friend to revere, that will a&s;toni&s;h and render common hearers incredulous. But this was the language of my heart: not of my tongue.
<PB N="124" REF="129">
That was dumb. A pre&s;&s;ure of the hand, with eyes averted, was all the utterance I had.</P>
<P>A child and its mother were the only pa&s;&s;engers be&s;ide our&s;elves. The coach, which was to be in London at ten that night, rolled along, they were a&s;leep, I was &s;ilent, and poor Clarke was full of ejaculation.</P>
<P>"If there be a good man on God's earth, that gentleman is one! He will find his road to heaven &s;afe enough! He will be among the &s;heep, and &s;it on the right hand of God! I hope I &s;hall be in his company! Though that can't be. I am unworthy. I may think my&s;elf happy to &s;it far enough lower down. Not that I can &s;ay; for I find the be&s;t people have the lea&s;t pride. Perhaps as it is in earth &s;o it may be in heaven. God &s;end us all &s;afe there together! For my part, I think that within the&s;e few weeks I am a dif|ferent kind of a creature. But what can
<PB N="125" REF="130">
a poor carpenter do? He mu&s;t not &s;peak to gentlefolk, unle&s;s in the way of his work: &s;o he can have no &s;ociability, but with his poor neighbours. And though &s;ome of them to be &s;ure be as good-meaning people as any on earth, they are no better learned than him&s;elf: &s;o they can teach him nothing. But I have hap|pened on good luck, &s;o I have no right to complain. And I am very &s;ure, in my own mind, that there is good luck in &s;tore for us all: for providence el&s;e would not have brought us and guided us where it did, by &s;uch marvellous means; &s;o that, while we thought we were breaking our necks and falling into the hands of murderers, and being frightened out of our &s;en&s;es by the mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;ights I mu&s;t &s;ay that ever were &s;een, we were all the while going &s;traight on as fa&s;t as we could to good fortune! So that it is true enough that man is blind, but that God can &s;ee."</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="131">What plea&s;ure does the mind of man take in &s;olving all its difficulties! How impatient is it that any thing &s;hould re|main unexplained; and how ready to elevate its own ignorance into my&s;tery and miracle!</P>
<P>To have remained longer &s;ilent, while the hone&s;t heart of my companion was thus overflowing with kindne&s;s, would have been no proof of the &s;ame excellent and winning quality in my&s;elf. I encou|raged his hopes, in which I was very rea|dy to participate. My own plea&s;ing dreams revived in full force; and I pre|&s;ently ranged my cloud-con&s;tructed ca&s;|tles, which I built, pulled down and re|built with admirable facility, and lorded it over my airy domains at will. 'Tis a folly to rail at the&s;e domains; for there are no earthly abodes that are half &s;o captivating.</P>
<P>Nothing worth mentioning happened on the road till we came to the la&s;t &s;tage
<PB N="127" REF="132">
but one, where we changed hor&s;es; at which time it was quite dark. Our fe|male companion and her child had been &s;et down at Hungerford; and two new pa&s;&s;engers, both ladies, as &s;oon as the hor&s;es were put to, were &s;hewn to the carriage.</P>
<P>They had a footman, who mounted the box; and we &s;oon learned from their di&s;cour&s;e that they had been waiting for the nephew of the elder lady, who was to have taken them in his phaeton, but that they had been di&s;appointed. They had been on a vi&s;it, and had been brought to Salt-hill in a gentleman's carriage; which they had &s;ent back. While the coach had &s;topped, I had fallen into a doze; but awoke when it began to move again, and when I heard the voices of females conver&s;ing.</P>
<P>The old lady &s;poke mo&s;t, and com|plained of the rudene&s;s of her nephew in &s;ubjecting them to the inconvenience of
<PB N="128" REF="133">
a &s;tage-coach, or of waiting they knew not how long till po&s;t-hor&s;es &s;hould come in, which as they were informed would be tired and unfit for more work: it happening that there was a great run at that time on the Bath road.</P>
<P>The reader will pre&s;ently under&s;tand that they were people of real fa&s;hion; and the elde&s;t lady &s;poke of per&s;ons and things which denoted that high life was familiar to her. This gave Clarke a new opportunity of wondering how he, a poor carpenter, came into &s;uch company: which he directly expre&s;&s;ed to me, with the &s;implicity and undi&s;gui&s;e that are common to &s;uch characters.</P>
<P>The old lady, who had before &s;ignified her chagrin at the expedient to which her nephew had reduced her, did not find her pride &s;oothed when &s;he learned that &s;he was in company with carpen|ters: for it &s;oon appeared that &s;he con&s;i|dered
<PB N="129" REF="134">
me and my companion as familiar acquaintances of the &s;ame rank.</P>
<P>Her young friend was likewi&s;e led into this error; and, when the former began to expre&s;s her di&s;gu&s;t too freely to accord with the feelings of the latter, &s;he inter|rupted her with &s;aying <HI>"Ayez la bont&eacute;, madame, de parler Franqois."</HI> "Be kind enough, madam, to &s;peak French."</P>
<P>The old lady complied; and a con|ver&s;ation en&s;ued which certainly will nei|ther &s;urpri&s;e nor move the reader &s;o much as it did me. Should he a&s;k how I, as a man of honor, could &s;uffer them to re|main in the deception of imagining I did not under&s;tand them, let him wait till he knows enough to &s;urmi&s;e what the emo|tions were that were in a moment kin|dled in my bo&s;om. At fir&s;t, indeed, they were but dark and improbable conjec|tures: but, dark as they were, they &s;hook my whole frame.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135">The dialogue that en&s;ued &s;oon te&s;ti|fied that the old lady was in no very complacent temper of mind. Her be|ginning &s;entences expre&s;&s;ed di&s;&s;atisfac|tion, were &s;arca&s;tic, and evidently glanced at her young companion, who&s;e replies were mild and conciliating. But, not &s;atisfied with indirect reproach, her a&s;&s;ail|ant, &s;till &s;peaking French, continued her interrogatories to the following effect.</P>
<P>"And are you &s;till determined, Mi&s;s, to per&s;i&s;t in your ob&s;tinate refu&s;al of his lord&s;hip?"</P>
<P>"Let me intreat you, dear madam, not to enter on that &s;ubject again."</P>
<P>"Oh, to be &s;ure! You very kindly intreat me to torment my&s;elf as much as I plea&s;e, &s;o that I do not trouble you!"</P>
<P>"How can you, madam, accu&s;e me of &s;uch cruelty? Is it ju&s;t? Am I indeed of &s;uch a nature?"</P>
<P>"Yes, indeed are you, Mi&s;s: however
<PB N="131" REF="136">
you may flatter your&s;elf. It is nothing but perver&s;ity that can make you trifle with the honor and happine&s;s of your fa|mily&mdash;Now you are &s;ilent! Your fine &s;pirit no doubt di&s;dains to reply!"</P>
<P>"What can I &s;ay?"</P>
<P>"Say that you are a head&s;trong girl; acknowledge your fault, and con&s;ent to be the wife of a peer&mdash;Silent again!"</P>
<P>"I could wi&s;h, madam, not to make you more angry."</P>
<P>"No, indeed; there is no occa&s;ion for that! You have been doing nothing el&s;e for many weeks pa&s;t. For my part, I can|not conceive what your objection can be! Had that de&s;perado been living, for whom &s;ince his death you have acknow|ledged what you call your weak prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould have known very well to what cau&s;e to attribute your &s;tubborn|ne&s;s: but, as it is, I cannot conceive either your motives or your meaning. Nothing however is to be wondered at,
<PB N="132" REF="137">
in a young lady of your character. No prudent per&s;on would have dared to in|dulge a thought in &s;avour of a mad ad|venturer, who&s;e actions were as ra&s;h as they were in&s;olent, who&s;e family was mean yet had dared to oppo&s;e and even make ridiculous attempts to rival that from which you are de&s;cended, and who yet was him&s;elf an outca&s;t of that family."</P>
<P>"It is cruel, madam, to di&s;turb the a&s;hes of the dead!"</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t word of retort that had e&s;caped the chidden &s;ufferer; and this was uttered in a voice half &s;uffocated with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Cruel, indeed! Every thing is cruel that contradicts the wi&s;hes of young la|dies, who&s;e melting tenderne&s;s is ruinous to them&s;elves and to every body that ought to be mo&s;t dear to them."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t pardon me, madam, for again and again repeating, in my own defence, that there is no part of my con|duct
<PB N="133" REF="138">
which can ju&s;tify &s;uch an accu&s;a|tion."</P>
<P>"How, Mi&s;s! Is an avowed partiality for a fortune-hunter no proof? Is it no &s;tain on the character of a modern young lady? Is it no in&s;ult to her family?"</P>
<P>"It was a partiality which had never been avowed, till death had put an end to hope. It was produced and coun|teracted by very extraordinary circum|&s;tances: but, however &s;trong it might be at &s;ome moments, which I acknowledge it was, for I di&s;dain fal&s;ehood, it was not indulged. I needed no monitor to &s;hew me there were too many rea&s;ons why it ought not to be."</P>
<P>"I have not patience. A runagate! A vagabond! A gambler! A prize-fight|er! One of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t con|temptible of adventurers! who had be|trayed his patrons, who had flown in the face of his benefactors, who was capable
<PB N="134" REF="139">
of every kind of malice and mi&s;chief, and who had not a &s;ingle virtue!"</P>
<P>"Madam, I cannot li&s;ten to &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion as that, however I may offend you, without continually prote&s;ting it is unfounded; and that you have been greatly mi&s;informed. I &s;corn to apolo|gi&s;e for his mi&s;takes: but I know that he had virtues which tho&s;e who have given you this character of him are never likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s. How he could be guilty of the crimes of which he has been ac|cu&s;ed I cannot conceive. Even when a boy, I have heard him expre&s;s &s;entiments which I &s;hall never forget; and which have &s;ince been confirmed by his ac|tions. You were acquainted with none of them. You &s;peak from report; and from report which I am &s;ure was fal&s;e, and wicked. His heart I know to have been compa&s;&s;ionate, his principles &s;uch as no mean mind could have conceived,
<PB N="135" REF="140">
and his courage blameably great; though it &s;aved my life. [Tears half choaked her utterance.] But for him I &s;hould have been where he now is: a different train of events might have taken place, and he perhaps might have been living. I owe him my life, and you mu&s;t forgive me if I cannot fit patiently and hear his memory traduced without the lea&s;t oc|ca&s;ion: for, [Her &s;obbing could not be &s;tifled.] &s;ince he is dead, you can no lon|ger think him dangerous."</P>
<P>Oh Olivia!</P>
<P>Gracious God! What were the throbs, the thrillings, the love, the indignation, the tran&s;ports, of my &s;oul! How did a few moments rai&s;e and allay in me the whirlwind of the pa&s;&s;ions! How did my frame tremble, and madden, and &s;hiver, and burn! How were my lips at once bur&s;ting with frenzy and locked in &s;ilence! It was my guardian angel that protected me, that pleaded for me, that awed me
<PB N="136" REF="141">
to patience, and that repaid by her &s;era|phic prai&s;e the virtue &s;he had in&s;pired!</P>
<P>Oh, yes, it was Olivia! It was &s;he her&s;elf that had the ju&s;tice, the fortitude, and the affection, to a&s;&s;ert the dignity of truth, to controvert an overbearing aunt whom &s;he revered, for this aunt had her virtues, and to &s;peak in defiance of that hypocri&s;y which inculcates the &s;ilence that intends to deceive, and which teaches females that &s;incerity is an un|pardonable vice.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>FALSE CONCLUSIONS RECTIFIED. A LOVER'S RE|VERIES. THE DANGERS OF A STAGE-COACH, IN A DARK NIGHT AND A FOG. THE DISCO|VERY OF MORE OLD ACQUAINTANCES, AND THE JOURNEY PURSUED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been truly remarked that the mo&s;t &s;erious and even the mo&s;t dignified
<PB N="137" REF="142">
emotions are &s;ometimes mingled with the mo&s;t ludicrous. When the divine Olivia had ended, there was a momen|tary pau&s;e; and Clarke, meditating no doubt on the advantages of which he had been deprived, and to the enjoyment of which every man feels he has a right, di|recting his remark to me, &s;uddenly ex|claimed&mdash;"What would I give now if I under&s;tood all that the&s;e ladies were &s;aying as well as you do!"</P>
<P><HI>"E&s;t-ce donc que Mon&s;ieur &s;&ccedil;ait parler Fran&ccedil;ois?</HI>&mdash;What, &s;ir! Can you &s;peak French?" &s;aid the aunt with a bur&s;t of &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," an&s;wered I; in a low and tremulous voice.</P>
<P><HI>"Ges&ugrave; Maria! Chi l' avrebbe pen&s;ato! Parliamo Italiano, Signora.</HI> Good God! who could have thought it! Let us &s;peak Italian, Mi&s;s," continued &s;he: but, &s;ud|denly recollecting her&s;elf, added&mdash;"Per|haps, &s;ir, you &s;peak that language, too?"</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="143">"Yes, madam."</P>
<P>A dead &s;ilence en&s;ued; which was on|ly once or twice interrupted by an excla|mation of di&s;content from the aunt. Each became bu&s;ied with their own thoughts: mine were di&s;tracted by doubts and ap|prehen&s;ions, concerning the manner in which I ought to act. I could come to no determination. To be &s;een by the aunt would not only have wounded her pride, and if po&s;&s;ible have rendered her more implacably my mortal enemy than &s;he had been, but it would have &s;ubject|ed Olivia, toward whom my heart was bur&s;ting with affection, to a &s;eries of new a&s;&s;aults and per&s;ecutions. Nay the &s;ud|den &s;ight of me might overpower her, and even have dangerous effects. Such at lea&s;t were the whi&s;perings either of my tenderne&s;s or my vanity. And yet to mi&s;s this opportunity, to acquaint her with none of tho&s;e overwhelming &s;en&s;a|tions that were all thankfulne&s;s, love, and
<PB N="139" REF="144">
adoration, and not &s;o much as to inform her that I was &s;till living, &s;till perhaps capable of all the good that &s;he had ever &s;uppo&s;ed of me, was in every view of it tormenting. How had &s;he &s;truggled to conceal her emotions when &s;he mention|ed my death, and that I had &s;aved her life! Should I de&s;erve this tenderne&s;s, if I could leave her to grieve a moment longer? Such unkindne&s;s were not only unworthy of me, but might be dangerous: it might even ri&s;k her compliance to the propo&s;ed match.</P>
<P>And here a torrent of painful anxieties and &s;urmi&s;es ru&s;hed upon me. The hate|ful &s;ubject was brought fully to my re|collection. Andrews was no longer the rival I had to dread. A lord had entered the li&s;ts: a peer of the realm had &s;ued for Olivia. Who could he be? Was it likely that &s;he &s;hould long with&s;tand the &s;olicitations of her aunt, endure her bit|ter upbraidings, and &s;uffer the rude
<PB N="140" REF="145">
taunts of her brother, while rank and &s;plendor were courting her acceptance, while coronets were crouching at her feet and &s;upplicating her compa&s;&s;ion? Which of our ancient barons could he be? How &s;hould I learn? Was he young, hand&s;ome, courteous, engaging? Had he the virtues and the high qualities which imagination is &s;o apt to attach to the word noble?</P>
<P>Another train of conjecture &s;eized up|on my thoughts. How did it happen that they &s;hould believe me dead? Who were the authors of this fal&s;e report? It mu&s;t &s;urely be intentional deceit; per|haps of the aunt, perhaps of Hector; in|vented to induce her to comply with their wi&s;hes, and ally them to the peer|age. I mu&s;t not &s;uffer it to continue. The aunt appeared to believe it; and that Olivia had no doubt of it was cer|tain. My fears confirmed me in the &s;u&s;|picion that it was a family artifice.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="146">I was at length awakened from the&s;e reveries by the aunt; who expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e and impatience at the &s;low driv|ing of the coachman. It &s;eems it had continued for &s;ome time, though not re|marked by me; and it was not long be|fore the coach &s;topped, when I perceived that we were in an uncommonly thick fog. Olivia was &s;till &s;ilent, but the aunt was alarmed by the voices of men; and, as the darkne&s;s and mi&s;t prevented all danger of my being known, I opened the coach-door and jumped out; and Clarke followed my example.</P>
<P>I found on enquiry we were pa&s;&s;ing Cranford-bridge at the beginning of Houn&s;low-heath, that a broad-wheeled waggon had approached, and that the coachman unable to di&s;tingui&s;h the road had alighted to lead his hor&s;es, left we &s;hould be overturned. He had tru&s;ted the reins to the footman who remained on the box.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="147">By the caution of the coachman, the waggon was &s;afely pa&s;&s;ed, and he thought proper to mount his box again: but he dur&s;t not venture to drive fa&s;t; and, as I was alarmed for the &s;afety of Olivia, I and Clarke continued be&s;ide the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We had not gone fifty yards before we were again entangled with a timber carriage; the driver of which, embar|ra&s;&s;ed by the fog, had turned it acro&s;s the road.</P>
<P>The waters, which lie in the hollows on the Houn&s;low-&s;ide of the bridge, had been greatly increa&s;ed by the late tem|pe&s;ts, and heavy rains. The coach hor&s;es began to &s;nort with more vehemence; for they had for &s;ome time been di&s;turb|ed with fright; and one of them, run|ning again&s;t the projecting timber, plun|ged, and terrified the re&s;t: &s;o that the two fore-hor&s;es, quitting the road, da&s;h|ed into the water, dragged the coach af|ter
<PB N="143" REF="148">
them in de&s;pite of the driver, and the near-wheels were hurried down the bank.</P>
<P>It fortunately happened that the de|clivity was not &s;teep enough immediately to overturn the coach; otherwi&s;e Olivia and her aunt would probably have lo&s;t their lives.</P>
<P>Bewildered by the fog, neither I nor Clarke could act with that promptitude which we de&s;ired. I however got to the hor&s;es' heads, my&s;elf above the knees in, water, and &s;topped them ju&s;t in time. I called to Clarke to come to me; and, as I knew him to be both &s;trong and deter|mined, I committed the hor&s;es to him and ran to &s;upport the carriage, left it &s;hould overturn.</P>
<P>The coachman &s;en&s;ible of his danger, took care to alight on the off-&s;ide. The footman did the &s;ame; and I, with an air of authority which the circum&s;tances in&s;pired, ordered them to come to me
<PB N="144" REF="149">
and &s;upport the coach. They obeyed. I ha&s;tened round to the other &s;ide, open|ed the door, fir&s;t took out the aunt, and then accompli&s;hed the wi&s;h of my heart: I held the lovely Olivia once more in my arms, and once more pre&s;&s;ed her to my bo&s;om, without the lea&s;t alarm to her delicacy.</P>
<P>For how many rapturous moments are lovers indebted to accident! Mine in|deed would have been a &s;ingle bli&s;s, and therefore unworthy the name, had not the tenderne&s;s and the truth of Olivia &s;o lately been manife&s;ted. But this addition made the tran&s;port unde&s;cribable! To be in my arms yet not to know me, but to &s;uppo&s;e me dead, to feel my embrace and to have no &s;u&s;picion that it was the embrace of love, to be once more &s;afe and I my&s;elf once more her protector, oh Imagination! Strong as thou art, thy power is in&s;ufficient for the repetition of
<PB N="145" REF="150">
&s;uch a &s;cene, for the complete revival of &s;uch ec&s;tacy!</P>
<P>I was unwilling to part with my pre|cious burthen, which I had no longer any pretence to retain. "Pray, &s;ir, put me down," &s;aid the angel; with a &s;weet, a gentle, and a thankful voice. " We are very &s;afe now: for which both I and my aunt are infinitely indebted to you."</P>
<P>I could make no reply: but I pre&s;&s;ed her hand with &s;omething of that too ar|dent ra&s;hne&s;s of which the aunt had ac|cu&s;ed me.</P>
<P>The old lady too did not forget her acknowledgments. She had no doubt now that I was a gentleman. My beha|viour proved it. She &s;hould be very proud to thank me, in a more proper place, for my civilities; and would en|deavour to repay the obligation if I would do her the favour to call in Hertford-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Olivia was not one of tho&s;e who think
<PB N="146" REF="151">
only of them&s;elves. "Having been &s;o good, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "as to take us out of danger, perhaps you could be &s;erviceable to the poor coachman."</P>
<P>"Let me fir&s;t &s;ee you back to the inn, ladies."</P>
<P>"Some accident may happen in the mean time. The hor&s;es are unruly. We will &s;tay here till all is &s;afe."</P>
<P>The advice was ju&s;t, and it came from Olivia. I obeyed and ha&s;tened to the coachman; who was bu&s;ied in loo&s;ing the traces, and relieving the hor&s;es from the carriage. This was pre&s;ently done; and the coach was left, till proper aid and more light could be obtained.</P>
<P>I then returned to Olivia; and, when the coachman came up, the aunt en|quired if their danger had been great?</P>
<P>"I don't know, madam, what you may call great," an&s;wered he; "but, if that gentleman had not &s;topped the cattle, and if the near wheels had gone one yard
<PB N="147" REF="152">
nay two feet farther I &s;hould have had an overturn; and then how either you or I could have got out of that gravel pit is more than I can tell. For my own part, I know, I thank him with all my heart; and the other gentleman too: for it is not often that your gentlemen are &s;o handy. In&s;tead of helping, they gene|rally want &s;omebody to help them. I hope they'll be civil enough to take a gla&s;s with me. By G&mdash; they &s;hall go to the depth of my pocket, and welcome."</P>
<P>"If that be the ca&s;e," replied the aunt, "we are all very much obliged to them indeed! But I will take care never to travel in a fog again."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as this was pa&s;&s;ing, we heard at a di&s;tance, and as if coming from the inn, a &s;houting of Hollo! Hoix! Coachee! Coach! where are you all?</P>
<P>"I declare," &s;aid the aunt, "that is my nephew's voice! This is very lucky! He will now take us in his phaeton."</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="153">"Surely, madam," exclaimed I, "you would not tru&s;t your&s;elf and this young lady in a phaeton &s;uch a night as this; when you &s;ee the mo&s;t experienced dri|vers are liable to &s;uch accidents?"</P>
<P>"If the lady does," continued the coachman as he was going, "why I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e &s;he does not value a broken neck of a farthing."</P>
<P>We then proceeded back to the inn, and were pre&s;ently joined by Hector; whom the aunt immediately began to rate.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus employed, I, endeavouring to di&s;gui&s;e my voice, as I had before done in the few &s;entences I had uttered, and addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Olivia, &s;aid, "I &s;hould be exceed|ingly concerned, madam, if I thought you would &s;uffer Mr. Mowbray to drive you home till day light &s;hall appear."</P>
<P>"I certainly &s;hall not, &s;ir;" an&s;wered &s;he. "But do you know my brother?"</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="154">"Madam!"</P>
<P>"You are acquainted with his name; and I don't recollect that it has been mentioned."</P>
<P>I he&s;itated, Hector turned upon us, we were approaching the light, and, with a &s;uddenne&s;s which fear and pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pired, knowing that Mowbray did not under&s;tand Italian, I &s;aid in an under voice&mdash;<HI>"Il' Signor Hugo Trevor non &eacute; morto, belli&s;&s;ima Signora;</HI> Mr. Trevor is not dead, deare&s;t lady"&mdash;At the &s;ame in&s;tant I &s;natched her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it, was about to rai&s;e it to my lips, but re|collecting my&s;elf, turned, &s;hort round, and added, <HI>"Addio!"</HI></P>
<P>Clarke was at my back; and I pluckled him by the coat, and whi&s;pered&mdash;"Come with me."</P>
<P>But what of Olivia? Was &s;he dead to feeling at this &s;trange my&s;terious mo|ment? Did no ru&s;hing orrent of ideas &s;uddenly overwhelm her? The man
<PB N="150" REF="155">
who&s;e lo&s;s &s;he had lamented not in his grave; that man again her &s;aviour, her guardian genius in the dark hour of dread and danger; acquainted in a way the mo&s;t extraordinary with her thoughts, and favourable wi&s;hes; or, as &s;he was too &s;everely inclined to term it, her pa&s;&s;ion and its folly; a witne&s;s that &s;he did not credit all which malice could urge again&s;t him, nor li&s;ten in ba&s;e &s;ilence when her perhaps too partial heart pleaded in his behalf; nay more, that man the protector of her aunt, by whom he had been &s;o often and &s;o bitterly reviled; that man travelling in ob&s;curity; in fa|miliar &s;ociety with a carpenter; yet brav|ing peril in her behalf, and &s;hunning the thanks which the uncommon &s;ervices he had rendered might boldly make him claim; avoiding them mo&s;t certainly be|cau&s;e of the mean condition to which he was reduced; faithful in his affection: for &s;uch his behaviour &s;poke him; but
<PB N="151" REF="156">
unfortunate, depre&s;&s;ed, de&s;pi&s;ed; &s;inking under poverty; langui&s;hing away his youth; or cru&s;hed by accumulating di&s;|a&s;ters!&mdash;Did no &s;uch fears, no &s;uch tender recollections, a&s;&s;ail her bo&s;om?&mdash; I have de&s;cribed her ill indeed if that could be &s;uppo&s;ed. I mu&s;t pur&s;ue my narrative: for how can I picture what mo&s;t indubitably mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed in her heart, &s;ince I feel my&s;elf &s;o very incapa|ble of delineating my own!</P>
<P>This adventure did not entirely end here. I wi&s;hed to have gone forward on foot to Houn&s;low without delay: but Clarke interceded for a gla&s;s of brandy. He &s;aid the water had chilled him; and he was &s;till more importunate with me to take the &s;ame preventative. I had no fear for my&s;elf; for I had no &s;uch feel|ing: but, as I did not think I had any right to trifle with his health. I returned with him; taking the precaution to go through the pa&s;&s;age to the kitchen door.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="157">Here, ju&s;t as we came to the thre&s;hold, who &s;hould be coming in face of us, carrying a pair of candles, but my quon|dam &s;ervant, Philip!</P>
<P>The in&s;tant he beheld me, he turned pale, trembled, &s;et down the lights, &s;tood agha&s;t for a moment, and then took to his heels.</P>
<P>Though not &s;o terrified, I was almo&s;t as much &s;urpri&s;ed as he; and &s;uffered him to e&s;cape before I had the pre&s;ence of mind to know how to act. As how|ever it was my plan to avoid being known my&s;elf for the pre&s;ent, I thought proper to make no other enquiry than to a&s;k who&s;e &s;ervant he was? and was an&s;wered that he came with the ladies, who had ju&s;t returned from the coach.</P>
<P>Various conjectures in&s;tantly cro&s;&s;ed my imagination; all of which were a&s;&s;o|ciated with the &s;udden flight from Bath, the robbery he had committed, the &s;eem|ing hone&s;ty and even affection of his
<PB N="153" REF="158">
character previous to that event, his now being in the &s;ervice of Olivia, for I un|der&s;tood him to be her own valet, and the &s;tory of my death. But, though my curio&s;ity was greatly excited, the pre&s;ent was not the time in which the&s;e my&s;teries could be unravelled. We therefore took Clarke's pre&s;cription again&s;t cold; and, leaving Cranford bridge, pur&s;ued our road to Houn&s;low: where we ar|rived about eleven o'clock, and put up at an inferior inn; left any accident &s;hould bring us again in company with the aunt and the nephew.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>MEDITATIONS ON WHAT HAD PASSED. THE CON|DOLENCE OF CLARKE. ARRIVAL AT LONDON. THE MEETING OF FORMER FRIENDS. LAW AR|RANGEMENTS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT may be well &s;uppo&s;ed that the in|cidents of this night were not ea&s;ily dri|ven from my imagination. While we were walking, the care we were obliged to take, and the gloom around us, pre|vented any thing from e&s;caping me &s;uffi|ciently marked to attract the notice of my companion. But, when we were &s;eated in a room with lights, and my mind was no longer diverted by other objects, the reveries into which I fell, the interjections that broke from me, the ha&s;ty and interrupted manner in which I ate and drank, the expre&s;&s;ions of extreme joy which altered my countenance at one moment, and the &s;olemn &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="155" REF="160">
which it a&s;&s;umed the next, with my eyes fixed, while the tears rolled down my cheeks, at la&s;t &s;o agitated poor Clarke that he exclaimed&mdash;"For God's &s;ake, Mr. Trevor, what is the matter with you?"</P>
<P>My &s;ilence, for I was unable to &s;peak, did but increa&s;e his alarm&mdash;"Are you taken ill? What has befallen you? Won't you open your mind to me? If I could do you any good, I hope you don't think I &s;hould be backward? Are you un|happy?"</P>
<P>"No, no."</P>
<P>"I am very glad of that. But &s;ome|thing uncommon I am &s;ure has happened to you: though it may not be fit perhaps that I &s;hould hear what. And I don't want to be a bu&s;y body; though I mu&s;t &s;ay I &s;hould be more at ea&s;e, if I was quite &s;ure that all was right. That's all. I have no other curio&s;ity."</P>
<P>"All is not right: but yet I hope it will
<PB N="156" REF="161">
be. I know not by what means. It &s;eems indeed impo&s;&s;ible! And perhaps it is; and yet I hope! I hope! I hope!"</P>
<P>"Well, well: I am glad of that. We &s;hould all hope. We are bid to hope. God help us if we did not. Perhaps I can't give you any help? I &s;uppo&s;e that is beyond me. I am &s;orry for it. But what can a poor carpenter do, in the way of befriending a gentleman?"</P>
<P>"A poor carpenter can have a kind heart; and I do not know whether that is not the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed thing on earth! Did you ever hear me repeat the name of Olivia?"</P>
<P>"Yes; when you were light-headed, I heard the name many a time and often. And the nur&s;e &s;aid you raved of nobody el&s;e. But we could none of us find out who &s;he was. Though, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I have often enough wi&s;hed to a&s;k: but that I did not think it became me to &s;eem to be at all prying."</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="162">"That is the lady you have been in company with to-night. It is &s;he whom you have helped me to &s;ave. I was &s;ufficiently indebted to you before: but what am I then at pre&s;ent?"</P>
<P>"Well, that to be &s;ure is accidental enough! I could not have thought it! How oddly things do fall out! But I am glad of it with all my heart!</P>
<P>"I could not &s;ee much of her, to be &s;ure; though I looked with all the eyes I had: but I thought &s;omehow &s;he &s;eemed as fine a young creature as I had ever beheld &s;ince the hour I was born; which the mildne&s;s of her voice did but make the more likely. I thought to my&s;elf, I never in my days heard any living &s;oul &s;o &s;weet-&s;poken. So that I mu&s;t &s;ay things have fallen out very &s;trangely.</P>
<P>"I always &s;aid to my Sally there mu&s;t be &s;omething between you and the gen|tlewoman the name of <HI>which</HI> was on your tongue's end &s;o often, while you
<PB N="158" REF="163">
were down in the fever; and I am glad to the heart that you have happened on her again &s;o unexpectedly: though I can &s;ee no good rea&s;on, now you have found her, why you &s;hould be in &s;uch a hurry to get away."</P>
<P>The unaffected participation of Clarke in all my joys and &s;orrows, the que&s;tions which his feelings impelled him to put, and the fidelity of his nature, as well as the impul&s;e which pa&s;&s;ion gave me to di&s;burthen my mind, were all of them inducements to &s;peak; and I informed him of many of tho&s;e particulars which have already been recited.</P>
<P>The more intimately he became ac|quainted with my hi&s;tory, the more powerfully he &s;eemed imbued with my hopes and fears; and the better &s;atisfied I was with the confidence I had repo&s;ed in him. I am unable to paint the hone&s;t indignation of his feelings and phra&s;eo|logy at the inju&s;tice which he as well as
<PB N="159" REF="164">
I &s;uppo&s;ed had been done me, the de|pre&s;&s;ion of his countenance when I dwelt on the de&s;pair and wretchedne&s;s which the almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of my obtaining Olivia in&s;pired, and the animation with which he &s;eemed as it were to &s;et his &s;houlders to the wheel, when my return|ing fervor led me to the oppo&s;ite extreme, and gave me confidence in my own powers and the &s;trenuous exertions on which I was re&s;olved.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation continued long after we retired to re&s;t; &s;o that our &s;leep was &s;hort: for we were up again very early, before it was light, and con|tinued our journey to London; where we arrived a little after nine in the morning.</P>
<P>I immediately proceeded to the lodg|ing of Mi&s;s Wilmot; whom I found where I had left her, and who was truly rejoiced to &s;ee me. Clarke had never been in London: I therefore took him
<PB N="160" REF="165">
with me, gave a proper account of him to Mi&s;s Wilmot, and we all breakfa&s;ted together, while Mary waited; who&s;e fea|tures as well as her words &s;ufficiently te&s;tified the unexpected plea&s;ure of the meeting, and who artle&s;sly related the apprehen&s;ions of her&s;elf and my few friends: at not hearing from me.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t enquiries were concerning Wilmot and Turl; and I was delighted to learn that Wilmot, whom I left in a &s;ickly &s;tate of mind that was &s;eriou&s;ly alarming, had been awakened by Turl to a more ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of human affairs; and had recovered much of the former vigour and ela&s;ticity of his talents.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter told me that he was at pre|&s;ent engaged in a periodical publication; and had be&s;ide compo&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of a comedy: of which Turl, as well as her&s;elf, conceived the greate&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>The reader &s;carcely need be told that this intelligence gave me great plea&s;ure.
<PB N="161" REF="166">
It led me to revolve mighty matters in my own mind, created emulation, and in&s;pired me with increa&s;ing confidence and alacrity. Yes, &s;aid I, exultingly, genius may &s;afely encounter and dare difficulties. Let it but confide in it&s;elf and it will conquer them all.</P>
<P>While we were conver&s;ing Wilmot came in.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t leave the imagination to paint the welcome we gave each other.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the change which had taken place in his form and phy&s;iog|nomy; and at the different a&s;pect they had a&s;&s;umed. Not that the marks of melancholy were quite eradicated: but, when I con&s;idered his whole appearance, he was &s;carcely the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>I produced &s;urpri&s;e in him of a con|trary kind. There was neither the wont|ed fre&s;hne&s;s of my complexion nor the fa&s;hionable ea&s;e of my air and dre&s;s, which he had remarked but a few months
<PB N="162" REF="167">
before; and he took the fir&s;t private op|portunity that offered to enquire, with great earne&s;tne&s;&s;, if there were any means by which he could be of &s;ervice?</P>
<P>Under the general &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which our pre&s;ent in&s;titutions in&s;pire, &s;uch que&s;tions are wonderfully endearing. I an&s;wered him that I had found a friend, who&s;e principles were as liberal and en|larged as they were uncommon; and that I would take an early occa&s;ion to give him an account of my pre&s;ent de|&s;igns, and the po&s;ture of my affairs.</P>
<P>He informed me that the &s;evere ap|plication of Turl had enfeebled his health, and had induced him to re&s;ide for a few weeks at a &s;mall place by the &s;ea-&s;ide, that he might enjoy the benefits of bath|ing and the fre&s;h breezes; for which purpo&s;e he had left London the week before: that neither Wilmot nor Turl him&s;elf con&s;idered his ca&s;e at pre&s;ent as the lea&s;t dangerous, but that they had
<PB N="163" REF="168">
both agreed this was a prudent &s;tep; and that he had received a letter from Turl, informing him of his &s;afe arrival; and that he thought he had already de|rived benefit and animation from the journey.</P>
<P>Turl was not a man to be known and to be thought of with apathy. The in|telligence Wilmot gave me, &s;oftened as it was by the circum&s;tances attending it, produced a very unplea&s;ant feeling. The po&s;&s;ibility of the lo&s;s of &s;uch a man, &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o benevolent, and &s;o undaunted in the cau&s;e of truth, was a &s;en&s;ation for which I have no epithet. Wilmot per|ceived what pa&s;&s;ed in my mind, and again a&s;&s;ured me of his thorough per&s;ua&s;ion that there was not any danger.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed as much of the morning together as Wilmot could &s;pare from his occupations; after which we parted, and each proceeded on his own concerns: I to enquire after a dwelling-place; and
<PB N="164" REF="169">
be to his literary engagements: while Clarke, in&s;tructed by Mary, went in &s;earch of a lodging for him&s;elf through tho&s;e &s;treets that were mo&s;t likely to afford him one at a rea&s;onable rate.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn had a relation of a young|er branch of the family in the law, whose name was Hilary, to whom I was recom|mended; and from whom I received the utmo&s;t attention, in con&s;equence of the letters I brought. This gentleman was an attorney of repute, a practitioner of uncommon hone&s;ty, a&s;&s;iduous and capa|ble as a profe&s;&s;ional man, a firm defender of freedom even to his own ri&s;k and de|triment, a &s;incere &s;peaker, a valuable friend, and in every &s;en&s;e a man of worth and principle.</P>
<P>Happy at all times to oblige, he will|ingly undertook the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned to him by Mr. Evelyn's recommendation; and, in pur&s;uance of his advice, I hired an apartment in the neighbourhood of
<PB N="165" REF="170">
Queen's-&s;quare Bloom&s;bury: that I might be within a convenient di&s;tance of the inns of Court, yet not entirely buried in the noi&s;e and &s;moke of the di&s;agreeable part of the town.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e informed Mr. Hilary of my determination not to be a dumb barri&s;ter; and having, from my appearance and mode of enunciation as well as from the letters of Mr. Evelyn, conceived rather a high opinion of my talents, he applaud|ed my plan: in pur&s;uance of which he recommended me to place my&s;elf with Coun&s;ellor Ventilate; a man of high &s;ituation in the law. I readily con&s;ent|ed; and it was agreed that he &s;hould &s;peak to that gentleman immediately on the &s;ubject, and appoint a meeting.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE MEDITATIONS RELATING TO OLIVIA; CON|CLUDING WITH A LOVE-LETTER. DOUBTS CON|CERNING ITS CONVEYANCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that Olivia was out of my thoughts. Knowing her kind|ne&s;s toward Mi&s;s Wilmot, I carefully took the fir&s;t opportunity to inform the latter of the chief incidents that had pa&s;&s;ed; and to concert with her &s;ome means, if po&s;&s;ible, of obtaining an interview.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wilmot no longer received any pecuniary aid from Olivia. Wilmot con|&s;idered it as a duty to provide for his &s;i&s;ter; and had too lofty a &s;en&s;e of inde|pendance to admit the repetition of the&s;e favours. Yet how far that pride of heart, which teaches us, not only that we &s;hould not &s;ubmit to receive pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from any human being except from our relations, but that the&s;e relations can accept of no relief, however much they
<PB N="167" REF="172">
may be in need of it, without tarni&s;hing our honor, is a que&s;tion which de&s;erves to be &s;eriou&s;ly examined. Not but, at that time, it &s;quared very aptly with my opinions. It may be further remarked of relations that, as they &s;ometimes think they ought only to receive aid from each other, &s;o, they mo&s;t of them imagine that, from each other, they may unblu&s;hingly extort all they can. The generous Wil|mot indeed was in no danger of this la&s;t mi&s;take.</P>
<P>But though money was no longer a motive for intercour&s;e, between the gen|tle Olivia and Mi&s;s Wilmot, there was no danger that either of the friends would forget the other; and the latter was too &s;incerely intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s both of me and Olivia not to be willing to pro|mote that happine&s;s, by every means in her power.</P>
<P>What the&s;e means &s;hould be was the difficulty we had to &s;olve. To u&s;e any
<PB N="168" REF="173">
kind of &s;tratagem would offend the deli|cate and ju&s;tly-feeling Olivia. To come upon her by &s;urpri&s;e, even if the opportu|nity &s;hould offer it&s;elf, would not be a manly and dignified proceeding.</P>
<P>I had always thought highly of that courage which, mild as her manners were, &s;he never failed to exert on trying occa&s;ions. Her defence of me in the coach was a proof that I had not over-e&s;timated her fortitude. It likewi&s;e &s;hew|ed that &s;he was under mi&s;takes concern|ing me that were dangerous, &s;hould they remain unexplained; and that, whenever I thought of them, which was but too often, excited my utmo&s;t indignation.</P>
<P>Bold however as &s;he was in my defence when &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed me dead, very differ|ent &s;en&s;ations might a&s;&s;ail her when &s;he &s;hould be convinced (if &s;he &s;till doubted) that I was living. Her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her aunt &s;eemed to be unlimited, as long as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that to comply would be
<PB N="169" REF="174">
le&s;s productive of harm than to re&s;i&s;t: but I had witne&s;&s;ed that &s;he would not con&s;ent to actions of great moment, which her heart di&s;approved.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts made it improbable that &s;he would grant me an interview, without her aunt's knowledge. What then was to be done? A letter, that &s;hould fully explain my thoughts, my plans, my de|termination, and my hopes and fears, ap|peared to be the mo&s;t eligible mode. Were I to prompt her to a clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence, I was well aware that I &s;hould highly and ju&s;tly offend her. She would con&s;ider it as little le&s;s than an in|&s;ult. Her conduct was open, her mind &s;uperior to deceit; and to be ignorant of this would be to &s;hew my&s;elf unworthy of her. The lover &s;hould di&s;dain to ex|cite his mi&s;tre&s;s to any action which he would di&s;approve in a wife; and this was a rule not to be infringed, by him who &s;hould a&s;pire to the noble-minded Oli|via.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175">To write then I re&s;olved; and in &s;uch a manner as to open my whole &s;oul to her, awaken her affections, call forth her admiration, agitate her with pity and love, and en&s;ure her per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Alas! I took the pen in hand, but was mi&s;erably deceived. I had undertaken an impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k. Thought was too rapid, too multifarious, too complicate; and the tracing of letters and words infi|nitely too &s;low, and frigid. At la&s;t how|ever, after repeated attempts, I deter|mined on &s;ending the following: with which when written I was very far from &s;atisfied; but of that I de&s;paired.</P>
<P>"To the woman whom my &s;oul adores how &s;hall I addre&s;s my&s;elf? Tumultu|ous thoughts, hopes that vani&s;h, and fears that di&s;tract, are ill fitted for &s;uch a ta&s;k. Governed by feelings which will admit of no controul, I can only claim your pardon on the plea of inability to pre|&s;erve that &s;ilence which it is temerity, or
<PB N="171" REF="176">
&s;omething wor&s;e, to break. My thoughts will have pa&s;&s;age, will ru&s;h into your pre&s;ence, will expo&s;e them&s;elves to the wor&s;t of calamities, your reproof and an|ger. Di&s;tracted as I am by a dread of the dangers that may re&s;ult from my &s;ilence, I per&s;uade my&s;elf that the&s;e dangers are more immediate and threat|ening, though &s;carcely more painful, than your di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>"You have &s;uppo&s;ed me dead; though by what &s;trange accident I cannot divine. Under that &s;uppo&s;ition, it was my mira|culous fortune, my ec&s;tatic bli&s;s, to hear you, with a purity of heart and a dignity of &s;entiment &s;uch as none but a heart like yours could conceive or expre&s;s, avow a former partiality in favour of one who, whatever may be his other faults, would gladly re&s;ign his life to &s;ecure your happine&s;s: of one who, in his over|weening affection has fondly and fooli&s;h|ly
<PB N="172" REF="177">
cheri&s;hed the per&s;ua&s;ion that this happi|ne&s;s is in&s;eparable from his own: nay who partly hopes and partly believes, &s;o blind is his egoti&s;m, that he is the only man on earth who fully comprehends your won|derful worth and matchle&s;s virtues; and who is pur&s;uing the fixed purpo&s;e of his &s;oul, that of finally de&s;erving you, from the conviction that he through life will be invariable in that admiration, that ten|derne&s;s, and that uncea&s;ing love without which the life of Olivia might perhaps be mi&s;erable. The&s;e may be the dreams of vanity, and folly: yet, if I do not mi&s;|take, they are the dreams of all lovers. They are indeed the aliment or rather the very e&s;&s;ence of love. What delight can equal that of revelling, in imagina|tion, on the happine&s;s we can be&s;tow on tho&s;e who have bli&s;s &s;o ineffable to be&s;tow upon us?</P>
<P>"What then if I were to &s;ee this Olivia
<PB N="173" REF="178">
mated with a man &s;o dull of faculty as &s;oon to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of the wondrous trea&s;ure in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: who never perhaps had any di&s;criminating know|ledge of its worth; and who &s;hall be willing to barter it for any vile and con|temptible gewgaw that may allure his de|praved ta&s;te, or &s;ickly appetite? Is there no &s;uch man? Are the&s;e fears wholly groundle&s;s?</P>
<P>"At what an immea&s;urable di&s;tance do I &s;eem ca&s;t from the enjoyment of that &s;upreme bli&s;s to which, perhaps, the fren|zy only of imagination could make me a&s;pire! There is but one means by which I can be happy. Either I am to be the mo&s;t favoured of mankind, or I am no|thing. Either I ri&s;e into godlike exi&s;t|ence, or I &s;ink unknown and never to be remembered. Either we are made for each other, or &mdash; I dare not think on the rever&s;e. It is too di&s;tracting.</P>
<P>"Yet I have no hope! What I now
<PB N="174" REF="179">
write is pre&s;umption, is madne&s;s! And why? It is not your beauty, your vir|tues, or the &s;upreme qualities of your mind that would rai&s;e this gulph of mi|&s;ery between us. No. Avarice, vanity, and prejudice are my enemies. It is they that would &s;acrifice you at their altars. That you will per&s;evere in your refu&s;al is my only hope.</P>
<P>"How &s;hall I palliate, what I cannot defend, my behaviour while I overheard you and your aunt? In vain do I plead that I was a&s;leep, when you came into the coach; and that I fir&s;t di&s;covered you by the &s;ound of your voice and the turn of the conver&s;ation; that I dreaded exciting any &s;udden alarm in you: per|haps it was a vain dread: and that, when I ought mo&s;t to have &s;poken, when I be|came the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e, I was then chained in &s;ilence by unconquerable emotions. Yet to be a li&s;tener? Indeed, indeed, it is a thing that my &s;oul di&s;dains!
<PB N="175" REF="180">
But I have done many &s;uch things; not knowing, while they pa&s;&s;ed, what it was that I did.</P>
<P>"My de&s;tiny now is to &s;tudy the law; and to this my days and nights &s;hall be devoted: but the di&s;tance at which I &s;ee my&s;elf from the goal is a thought which I am obliged, by every po&s;&s;ible effort, to &s;hut out of my memory.</P>
<P>"I am in want of con&s;olation; but &s;ince your &s;ociety is denied me, I know not where it may be found. I own, there are moments in which I am fearfully agi|tated. Yet I do not &s;olicit an an&s;wer. Let me rather peri&s;h than prompt you to an action of the propriety of which even I am obliged to doubt; &s;ince it cannot I &s;uppo&s;e be done without concealment. Oh that you knew every thought of my heart! You would then perceive the burning de&s;ire I have to make my&s;elf every way worthy of that unutterable bli&s;s to which I a&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="181">"Madman! I a&s;pire?</P>
<P>"With what contempt would &s;uch during be treated, by tho&s;e whom cu&s;|tom and ties of blood have taught you to revere! I confe&s;s this is a thought which I cannot endure. Yet I can le&s;s endure to relinqui&s;h my impo&s;&s;ible hopes. Could you conceive what the&s;e contradictory and tormenting &s;en&s;ations are, you would perhaps be induced to pardon &s;ome of the extravagant acts which I heard you &s;o mildly, yet &s;o ju&s;tly, cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>"To be yours then is the end for which I live; and yet my pride and every other feeling revolts, to think I &s;hould entreat you to accept a pauper, either in wealth or principle. Well, then, I will not wa&s;te my time, in complaint. Let me become worthy of you, or let me pe|ri&s;h! Fool! That is impo&s;&s;ible. But if full I mu&s;t, I will endeavour to make my ruin re&s;pectable.</P>

If it were addre&s;&s;ed directly to her, what certainty had I that it would not be open|ed by the aunt? Nay was not that indeed the mo&s;t probable? And would it in that ca&s;e ever be &s;een by Olivia? In my ap|prehen&s;ion certainly not.</P>
<P>I had then to chu&s;e whether I would &s;end a me&s;&s;enger, who &s;hould wait about the hou&s;e and take &s;ome opportunity to deliver it clande&s;tinely; or commit it to the care either of Mary or Mi&s;s Wilmot.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger was a very objection|able expedient: it was mean, and lia|ble to detection. The medium of Mary was &s;omething of the &s;ame kind; and the friend&s;hip and intelligence of Mi&s;s Wilmot rendered her intervention much the mo&s;t de&s;irable.</P>
<P>It was a delicate office to require of her. But &s;he could &s;peak the truth: &s;he could &s;ay that it was to relate &s;ome facts which Olivia might even de&s;ire to
<PB N="180" REF="185">
know, that it contained nothing which I my&s;elf &s;hould wi&s;h her to conceal, if &s;he thought fit to &s;hew it; that it did not invite her to any improper corre&s;pond|ence; and that it was the only one which, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, I meant to obtrude upon her.</P>
<P>That Mi&s;s Wilmot might be convinced I had neither deceived my&s;elf nor her in this account, which I &s;hould in&s;truct her to give of it, I ha&s;tened with it to her lodgings, and reque&s;ted her to read it before it was &s;ealed. Having ended, &s;he was &s;o well &s;atisfied with the propriety both of writing and delivering it that &s;he readily undertook the latter office; and with her I left it, hoping that Olivia would &s;oon call, would read it in her pre&s;ence, and that I &s;hould quickly learn what might be the &s;en&s;ations it &s;hould pro|duce.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>COUNSELLOR VENTILATE AND THE LAW. RAP|TURES EXCITED BY THE PANEGYRIC OF BLACK|STONE. DIALOGUES LEGAL AND POLITICAL, WITH CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MEANTIME the appointed interview between me and Coun&s;ellor Ventilate took place. This gentleman was cha|racterized by tho&s;e manners, and opi|nions, which the profe&s;&s;ion of the law is &s;o eminently calculated to produce. He had a broad brazen &s;tare, a curl of con|tempt on his upper-lip, and a &s;omewhat &s;hort &s;upercilious no&s;e. His head was habitually turned upward, his eye in the contrary direction, as if on the watch in expectation to detect &s;omething which his cunning might turn to advantage, and his half-opened mouth and dropping jaw &s;eemed to &s;ay, "What an immen&s;e fool is every man I meet!"</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="187">His whole manner and a&s;pect appeared to denote that he was in a continual re|very; and that he imagined him&s;elf in a court of law; brow-beating a witne&s;s, in|terrogating an idiot, or detailing ca&s;es and precedents, to &s;hew the &s;ubtlety with which he could mi&s;lead and confound his hearers. A &s;plit-hair di&s;tinction with|out a difference gave him rapture; and whenever it happened to puzzle, which was but too often, he rai&s;ed his left &s;houl|der and gave a hem of congratulation to him&s;elf: denoting his conviction that he was indi&s;putably the greate&s;t lawyer in the world! And, if the greate&s;t lawyer, he was as certainly, according to his own creed, the greate&s;t man! For the re&s;t of mankind, if put in competition with law|yers, what were they? What but poor, &s;illy, imbecile creatures?</P>
<P>One &s;tandard, by which he delighted to mea&s;ure his own talents, was the length to which he could drawl out a reply.
<PB N="183" REF="188">
Was there a man to be found who could &s;peak eight hours uncea&s;ingly? He would &s;urpa&s;s him. When his turn came, nine &s;hould not &s;uffice. He would be more dull, contradictory, and intolerable, than his rival by an hour, at lea&s;t. He would repeat precedents, twi&s;t &s;entences, mi&s;|con&s;true maxims, and &s;o perplex and en|tangle his own intellect that his hearers had no way of getting rid of the pain he excited; except by falling a-&s;leep, or de|termining not to li&s;ten. It mu&s;t be own|ed however he had &s;ome charity for them; for to &s;leep he gave them a very &s;uffi|cient provocative.</P>
<P>Being one of the retainers of govern|ment, he had a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons: where he u&s;ed to ri&s;e in his place and addre&s;s the Speaker, with no le&s;s logic, love of ju&s;tice, and legi&s;lative wi&s;dom, than he was wont to di&s;play when pleading in the courts.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="189">It was in vain that he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the ridicule of this mo&s;t di&s;cerning body, not le&s;s witty than virtuous. Of &s;hame he was incapable. He would again and again ri&s;e in his place, totally forgetful of pa&s;t flagellation, and again and again convince Mr. Speaker and the honorable members: per&s;i&s;ting to labour, in the hope of making them all as pro|found rea&s;oners as him&s;elf. No matter that the thing was impracticable: he would get up and do his duty, and &s;it down and receive his own applau&s;e.</P>
<P>To mention &s;hame in this ca&s;e was in|deed ab&s;urd. How &s;hould a man blu&s;h at reproof which he cannot comprehend? His &s;kull was &s;o admirably fortified, by nature, that it was equally impenetrable to the heavy batteries of argument or the &s;kirmi&s;hing artillery of wit. Let the can|non roar: he heard it not. He was ab|&s;tractedly contemplating tho&s;e ob&s;cure
<PB N="185" REF="190">
depths in which he remained for ever &s;eated; and where he had vi&s;ions innu|merable, though he &s;aw nothing.</P>
<P>One favourite and never-failing object, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, was to in&s;truct the hou&s;e in law. And here the devil, who is him&s;elf a kind of lawyer, for he devours his be&s;t friends, the devil I &s;ay cho&s;e the&s;e opportunities to vent his choice&s;t malice. He did not &s;et a lawyer to con|found a lawyer: that were but a &s;tale de|vice. He humbled him out of the mouths of men who had occa&s;ionally read law-books, it is true: but who had read them without a lawyer's obliquity; and had enquired what was the &s;imple unadulte|rated intention of their authors. Now law, which in all its &s;tages has a quibble in either eye, that may mean good or may mean ill, is every where, except in a Court of Ju&s;tice, capable of a good in|terpretation. This is not a rule without an exception: but in many ca&s;es at lea&s;t,
<PB N="186" REF="191">
law has &s;omething intentionally benefi|cial in its principle.</P>
<P>For this beneficent vital-&s;park every body, but a lawyer, is in &s;earch; and it is what every body, but a lawyer, is delight|ed to find. No wonder therefore that a lawyer &s;hould meet di&s;comfiture, and con|fu&s;ion, when he pretends to di&s;cu&s;s the ab&s;tract nature of ju&s;tice, in any place ex|cept in the&s;e afore&s;aid Courts of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus it happened that Mr. Ventilate was, on all &s;uch occa&s;ions, confounded in that honorable hou&s;e, of which he was an honorable member: which indeed, when we remember who were his opponents, was le&s;s miraculous than the immaculate conception&mdash;P&s;haw! I mean the tran&s;|migrations&mdash;of Vi&s;hnoo.</P>
<P>Much of the conceit and ridicule of the character of Mr. Ventilate was appa|rent, even to my eye, at our fir&s;t meet|ing. But he was a per&s;on of great prac|tice, and had the reputation of a &s;ound
<PB N="187" REF="192">
lawyer: which &s;ignifies a man who has patience to read reports, and a faci|lity at quoting them. Be&s;ide, I was in ha&s;tle; and rather inclined to leap over an ob&s;tacle than to go round it.</P>
<P>Accordingly our arrangements were made, and the next day I attended at his chambers; with a firm and as I &s;uppo&s;ed not to be &s;haken determination to be|come one of the greate&s;t lawyers the world ever beheld.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t book I was advi&s;ed to read, as a hi&s;torical introduction to and com|pendium of law, was Black&s;tone's Com|mentaries. This author had acquired too much celebrity for any man of liberal education to be ignorant of his fame. I therefore began and continued to read him with all the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that an author him&s;elf could wi&s;h in his favour. The panegyric he makes on Engli&s;h laws, and the Con&s;titution of Britain, gave me delight and animation. The reproof he
<PB N="188" REF="193">
be&s;tows, on gentlemen who are ignorant of this branch of learning, and on the perplexities introduced into our &s;tatute-law by &s;uch "ill-judging and unlearned legi&s;lators," and his prai&s;e of the capa|city they would acquire for admini&s;tering ju&s;tice, to which &s;acred function they are &s;o often called, were this ignorance re|moved, gave dignity to the &s;tudy I was about to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Then the account given of Servius Sulpicius! who, according to my learned author, "left behind him about a hun|dred and four-&s;core volumes of his own compiling!" How wonderfully did it move my admiration! I previou&s;ly knew that in mo&s;t countries, which are deno|minated civilized, law was voluminous: but I had never till then imagined that one man could him&s;elf compile a hun|dred and four-&s;core volumes! And, as it &s;eems, could compile them at his lei&s;ure too: for his chief bu&s;ine&s;s was that of
<PB N="189" REF="194">
oratory! Be&s;ide which it lives on record that, being a firm patriot, he was a wi&s;e and indefatigable &s;enator! But it appears that Sulpicius could devour law with greater ca&s;e than Milo, or perhaps even than Cacus him&s;elf, could oxen.</P>
<P>Neither was it recorded that this pro|digy of legal learning began young. And &s;hould I then de&s;pair of equalling him? No, no: get me into one of my trances and, had he compiled as many thou&s;ands of volumes, I &s;hould &s;carcely have &s;u&s;|pected that I could not compile as fa&s;t as he.</P>
<P>As I read on, how did I deplore the quarrel between Vicarius and his oppo|nents: or, in other words, between the pandects and the common law of En|gland: with the ignorance that had nearly been the re&s;ult! How rejoice in the in&s;ti|tution of tho&s;e renowned hot-beds of law, the Inns of Court: by the aid of which, had not the rage for enacting laws kept
<PB N="190" REF="195">
pace with the rage for &s;tudying them, there were hopes that the whole king|dom would in time have been &s;o learned in the &s;cience that every man might in|deed have become his own lawyer.</P>
<P>How did I regret that I had not &s;tu|died common-law while at college! How &s;ympathi&s;e with my author, when he ex|claims&mdash;"That a &s;cience, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the criterions of right and wrong; which teaches to e&s;tabli&s;h the one, and prevent, puni&s;h, or redre&s;s the other; which employs in its theory the noble&s;t faculties of the &s;oul, and exerts in its practice the cardinal virtues of the heart: a &s;cience, which is univer&s;al in its u&s;e and extent, accommodated to each individual, yet comprehending the whole commu|nity; that a &s;cience like this &s;hould ever have been deemed unnece&s;&s;ary to be &s;tu|died in a univer&s;ity, is a matter of a&s;to|ni&s;hment and concern!"</P>
<P>How did I ble&s;s the memory of Mr.
<PB N="191" REF="196">
Viner, who had found a remedy for this evil, by e&s;tabli&s;hing an Oxford profe&s;&s;or|&s;hip; and how promi&s;e to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of his abridgment, till I had every ca&s;e it contained at my tongue's end! What were four and twenty volumes in folio? Compared to Sulpicius, it was a trifle!</P>
<P>The eulogium that I next came to on a univer&s;ity education, how grateful was that to my heart! I was not, as my oracle de&s;cribed, though one of the "gen|tlemen of bright imaginations, to be wea|ried; however unpromi&s;ing the &s;earch." Neither was I to be numbered among tho&s;e "many per&s;ons of moderate capa|city, who confu&s;e them&s;elves at fir&s;t &s;et|ting out; and continue ever dark and puzzled during the remainder of their lives." The law being it&s;elf &s;o luminous, there was no fear of that with me.</P>
<P>I met indeed with one overwhelming a&s;&s;ertion. "Such knowledge as is nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="192" REF="197">
for a judge is hardly to be acquired by the lucubrations of twenty years!"</P>
<P>But this to be &s;ure mu&s;t be meant of dull fellows. As to the limits of genius, they were unknown.</P>
<P>My plea&s;ure revived in full force, when I arrived at my author's definition of law: which he &s;tates to be&mdash;"a rule of civil conduct, pre&s;cribed by the &s;upreme power in a &s;tate; commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong." What will you &s;ay to that, friend Turl? exclaimed I: putting down the book, and pau&s;ing. Can any thing be more provi|dent, more wi&s;e, more de&s;irable?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I found the writer &s;o clearly under&s;tood and &s;atisfactorily explained the nature of law, and the benefits ari&s;ing from it, that, for my own part, I began to be a&s;hamed of my former &s;tupidity. It was all &s;o &s;elf-evident that it &s;eemed di&s;graceful not to know it as it were by intuition. I was in that preci&s;e temper
<PB N="193" REF="198">
of mind which renders conviction an ea&s;y ta&s;k: for I was in ha&s;te to be rich, and famous; and the de&s;ire of wealth and fame are two of the &s;tronge&s;t provocatives to faith that the &s;agacity of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s has ever yet di&s;covered.</P>
<P>While I was in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e admirings, my attention was rou&s;ed by a dialogue that pa&s;&s;ed between two of my &s;enior fellow-pupils, who&s;e names were Rudge and Trottman, which the former thus began.</P>
<P>"That was a d&mdash; ra&s;cally cau&s;e we were concerned in ye&s;terday."</P>
<P>"Ra&s;cally enough. But we got it."</P>
<P>"I can't &s;ay but I was &s;orry for the poor farmer."</P>
<P>"Sorry! Ha, ha, ha! You remind me of an unfle&s;hed-recruit: or a young &s;urgeon, who has ju&s;t begun to walk the ho&s;pitals. Frequent the Courts, and you will &s;oon learn to forget commi&s;eration, and attend to nothing but law. Docking of entails gives the lawyer as little con|cern
<PB N="194" REF="199">
as the amputation of limbs does the &s;urgeon: they are both of them curious only about the manner, and dexterity of the operation."</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e it will ruin the man."</P>
<P>"He was a fool for making it a cri|minal pro&s;ecution. He &s;hould have brought an action for damages."</P>
<P>"It is an aggravating thing for a man to have his daughter &s;educed, be beaten him&s;elf becau&s;e he was angry at the injury, and, when he &s;ues for redre&s;s, not only be unable to obtain it, but find his fortune de&s;troyed, as well as his daughter's character, and his own peace."</P>
<P>"The law knows nothing concerning him, or his fortune, character, peace, or daughter. It is and ought to be dead to private feeling. It mu&s;t con&s;ider no|thing but the public benefit: nor mu&s;t it ever conde&s;cend to vary from its own plain and literal con&s;truction."</P>
<P>"That is &s;trange: for its origin &s;eems
<PB N="195" REF="200">
to have been in tho&s;e very feelings, to which it is &s;o dead."</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly. But it provides for &s;uch feelings each under its individual cla&s;s; and if a man, &s;eeking redre&s;s, &s;hall &s;eek it under a wrong head, that is his fault; and not the fault of the law."</P>
<P>"It is a fault, however, that is daily committed."</P>
<P>"Ay to be &s;ure: or there would be but few lawyers."</P>
<P>"How &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Why, if a man doing wrong was cer|tain, or almo&s;t certain, of being detected and expo&s;ed, the chances would be &s;o much again&s;t offenders that offences would of cour&s;e dimini&s;h."</P>
<P>"Then the pro&s;perity of lawyers &s;eems to re&s;ult from the blunders which they them&s;elves commit?"</P>
<P>"No doubt it does; and, as the blun|ders are innumerable, their pro&s;perity mu&s;t be in proportion."</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="201">"There &s;eems to be &s;omething wrong in this; though I cannot tell what or why."</P>
<P>"Ha, ha, ha! You have no cau&s;e to complain: you are a lawyer, and your own intere&s;t mu&s;t teach you that every thing is right. Except indeed that the cla&s;&s;es or heads I mentioned, and con&s;e|quently the blunders, are not numerous enough. But, thank heaven, we have a remedy for that: for our &s;tatute-books are daily &s;welling."</P>
<P>"Why, yes! Some people &s;ay they are pregnant with mi&s;chief: of which it is further a&s;&s;erted that they are daily de|livered."</P>
<P>"Ay, certainly; and to the great joy of the parents."</P>
<P>"Who are they?"</P>
<P>"Enquire for the father at St. Ste|phen's; and for the mother at We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall. I a&s;&s;ure you they are both enraptured at their own offspring. The
<PB N="197" REF="202">
old lady &s;its in &s;tate, and daily prai&s;es her babes with the mo&s;t doating loquacity. And &s;he does this with &s;o grave a face that it is impo&s;&s;ible to forbear laughing, when you hear her. She is &s;o &s;erious, &s;o &s;olemn, &s;o convinced that every thing &s;he utters is oracular, and &s;o ira&s;cible if &s;he does but &s;o much as &s;mell a doubt con|cerning the beauty and perfection of her brats, that there is no &s;cene in the world which tickles my imagination &s;o irre&s;i&s;ti|bly as to watch her maternal vi&s;age dur|ing her eulogiums, while the big-wigs are nodding approbation; or the contortions of her phy&s;iognomy, when any cro&s;s in|cident happens to impede the torrent of her fondne&s;s. With all due re&s;pect to her motherly functions, &s;he is a very freaki&s;h and laughable old lady."</P>
<P>"You have a turn for ridicule: but I confe&s;s, if I thought your picture were true, I do not believe my &s;en&s;ations
<PB N="198" REF="203">
would be &s;o plea&s;ant as yours appear to be."</P>
<P>"And why, in the name of common &s;en&s;e?"</P>
<P>"How can one laugh at the mi&s;takes and mi&s;eries of mankind?"</P>
<P>"For a very &s;imple rea&s;on: becau&s;e it is the only way that can render them endurable. None but a fool would cry at what cannot be corrected."</P>
<P>The colloquy between my compa|nions here took another direction, le&s;s intere&s;ting to me, and left me to pau&s;e and ruminate. This picture, &s;aid I, is &s;atirical I own: but &s;urely it is unju&s;t. Black&s;tone, beyond all doubt, under|&s;tood the &s;cience profoundly; and his account of it is very different indeed.</P>
<P>I turned back to the pa&s;&s;age I have quoted.</P>
<P>"It di&s;tingui&s;hes the criterions of right and wrong; teaches us to e&s;tabli&s;h the
<PB N="199" REF="204">
one and prevent puni&s;h or redre&s;s the other; employs in its theory the noble&s;t faculties of the &s;oul, and exerts in its prac|tice the cardinal virtues of the heart: it is univer&s;al in its u&s;e and extent, is ac|commodated to each individual, and yet comprehends the whole community."</P>
<P>How ju&s;t, how ennobling, how &s;ublime is this prai&s;e! To compare it to the doat|ings of an old woman is extremely fal&s;e: nay is pernicious; for, by exciting laugh|ter, it mi&s;leads the judgment.</P>
<P>My companions being &s;ilent, I was impelled to addre&s;s my&s;elf to Trott|man. "I wonder, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "that you &s;hould be &s;uch an enemy to law."</P>
<P>"I an enemy! You totally mi&s;take. I am its fa&s;t friend. And with good rea|&s;on: I find it a very certain &s;ource of ea&s;e and affluence even to the mo&s;t &s;tupid blockheads, if they will but drudge on; and of riches, honours, and hereditary
<PB N="200" REF="205">
fame, to men of but very moderate talents. I may &s;urely expect to come in for my &s;hare; and therefore &s;hould be a rank fool indeed were I its enemy. I leave that to innovating fanatics. Let them dream, and rave, and write: while I mind my own affairs, take men as they are and ever mu&s;t be, profit by &s;upport|ing pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hments, and look down with contempt on the puppies who prate philo&s;ophy, and bawl for reform."</P>
<P>I was &s;tung. Con&s;cious of the turn my own thoughts had taken, I &s;u&s;pected that he had divined this from &s;ome words which I might have dropped, and that his attack was per&s;onal: I therefore ea|gerly replied&mdash;"Your language, &s;ir, is unqualified."</P>
<P>"I meant no offence. If you are a reformer, I beg your pardon. I never quarrel about what I have heard certain pompous gentlemen call principles."</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="206">"Then all tho&s;e per&s;ons, who differ in opinion from you, are puppies; and pompous gentlemen?"</P>
<P>"Oh dear, no, &s;ir! Only all tho&s;e that are ab&s;ent. The company, you know, according to the received rule, is ex|cepted."</P>
<P>There was &s;omething impudently hum|ble and &s;atirical in his look, while he uttered this: yet &s;o contrived as to make the man appear a petti&s;h angry block|head, who &s;hould take offence at it; and I certainly was not inclined to quarrel with my new comrades, the fir&s;t day of our acquaintance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, Trottman was a little in&s;igni|ficant man, in appearance; pot-bellied, of a &s;warthy complexion, but with keen|ne&s;s, cunning, and mockery in his eye; and who&s;e form and figure, as well as his turn of mind, mu&s;t have made it ridicu|lous to have quarrelled with him. I
<PB N="202" REF="207">
therefore waited for &s;ome more fortunate opportunity, to repay him in his own coin: for I was as unwilling to be van|qui&s;hed by wit, and &s;atire, as by force of argument, or of arms.</P>
<P>Rudge, who&s;e temper was more pla|cid but who had an enquiring mind, &s;aid, "You do not know my friend Trott|man yet, Mr. Trevor. He cares but little who has the mo&s;t rea&s;on, &s;o that he may have the mo&s;t laughter."</P>
<P>"Life is a journey," added Trottman; "and, if I can travel on terra firma, with a clear &s;ky, and a &s;miling land&s;cape, let tho&s;e that plea&s;e put to &s;ea in a butcher's tray, and &s;ail in que&s;t of foul weather."</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;ir, but the &s;earch of ea&s;e is the lo&s;s of happine&s;s; and to fly from dan|ger is the likelie&s;t way to meet it: that is, when you either &s;eek or fly without a guide."</P>
<P>"And who is this guide to &s;afety?"</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="208">"It is, what you appear to hold in contempt, Principle."</P>
<P>"Ha, ha, ha! Right! The blind lead|ing the blind. Conjure up one phan|tom to &s;eek for another. How prodigi|ou&s;ly we improve!"</P>
<P>"From what you have &s;aid, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that you &s;hould con&s;ider prin|ciple as a phantom. But you only quar|rel with the word: for, as principle can mean nothing more than a rule of action, deduced from pa&s;t experience and influ|encing our pre&s;ent conduct, you, cer|tainly, like other men, act from principle. It is a moral duty to &s;hun pain, and keep your fingers out of the fire."</P>
<P>"Not if I want to &s;ear up a wound."</P>
<P>"You are excellent at a &s;hifting blow. But why would you apply the cautery? Becau&s;e principle, guided by experience, has previou&s;ly told you that to cauterize is in &s;ome ca&s;es the way to heal."</P>
<P>"But empirics, who cauterize without
<PB N="204" REF="209">
healing, are daily multiplying upon us."</P>
<P>"Were that granted, it is but em|piric oppo&s;ed to empiric. Men have been groaning under their &s;ufferings for ages; and, &s;ince ages have proved that the old pre&s;criptions were in&s;ufficient, I can neither &s;ee the danger nor the blame of following new."</P>
<P>"Zeal may be purblind, and perhaps could not &s;ee a guillotine: but her neck might chance to feel it."</P>
<P>"Then you think a guillotine a more terrible thing than a halter, an axe, or perhaps even a rack?"</P>
<P>"It will do more work in le&s;s time."</P>
<P>"And you &s;uppo&s;e it to be principle, or if you plea&s;e innovation, that has gi|ven this machine its momentum?"</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e! Is there any doubt?"</P>
<P>"Infinite. I imagine it to be given, if we may be allowed to per&s;onify, nei|ther by Innovation nor E&s;tabli&s;hment;
<PB N="205" REF="210">
but by the ra&s;hne&s;s and ill temper with which the&s;e heroines have mutually main|tained their po&s;itions. Innovation &s;truck the ball at fir&s;t too impetuou&s;ly: but E&s;tabli&s;hment took it at the rebound, and returned it with triple violence. Brun&s;wickian manife&s;toes, and extermi|nating wars, were not ill adapted to rai&s;e the diabolical &s;pirit of revenge. An en|deavour to &s;tarve a nation, which it was found difficult to exterminate by fire and &s;word, was not a very charitable act in Madam E&s;tabli&s;hment. Her &s;windling forgeries were little better; and that her turn &s;hould come, to be &s;tarved and &s;windled, is not miraculous: though it is deplorable. Heaven avert her claims to the guillotine!"</P>
<P>My antagoni&s;t had no immediate re|ply; and Rudge exclaimed, with &s;ome &s;atisfaction, "Why, Trottman, you have met with your match!"</P>
<P>"Not I, indeed," an&s;wered he, peev|i&s;hly.
<PB N="206" REF="211">
"I am only lo&s;t in a labyrinth of words; and am waiting for Principle to come and be my guide. But I am afraid &s;he carries a dark lanthorn; which will but blind tho&s;e that look."</P>
<P>"I &s;u&s;pect, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "you are le&s;s at lo&s;s for a joke than an argument; and that you prefer bu&s;h-fighting. For my own part, I love the fair and open field of enquiry."</P>
<P>"As this is a field that has no limits, nor any end to its cro&s;s roads, I am con|tent, as you &s;ay, to &s;it down under my hedge and be quiet."</P>
<P>"No, no; I did not &s;ay that: for I &s;ee you love to draw a &s;ly bow at pa&s;&s;engers."</P>
<P>"I have now and then brought down a gull, or an owl."</P>
<P>"Have you &s;hot any of tho&s;e birds to|day?"</P>
<P>I felt no compunction in making this triumphant retort to his &s;neer. And here our dialogue ended. Though it
<PB N="207" REF="212">
was a kind of declaration of war; I mean a war of words; which, as we became more acquainted, was occa&s;ionally waged with &s;ome a&s;perity.</P>
<P>But, in one re&s;pect, Trottman was my &s;uperior. To &s;neer was habitual to him: but it was always done in a manner which &s;eemed to indicate that he him&s;elf had no &s;u&s;picion of any &s;uch intent. So that he continually appeared to keep his temper; and never triumphed &s;o effectually as when he could provoke me to lo&s;e mine. On which occa&s;ions his additional conciliatory &s;arca&s;ms, ac|companied with &s;miles denoting the en|joyment of his victory, never failed to make me feel my own littlene&s;s. And this is a le&s;&s;on for which I con&s;ider my&s;elf as very highly in his debt.</P>
<P>I now pur&s;ued my reading; and em|ployed the re&s;t of the day in beginning to copy the manu&s;cript precedents, that were to capacitate me for the practice of
<PB N="208" REF="213">
law: for the number of which, that were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Mr. Ventilate was famed.</P>
<P>My ardour however had felt &s;ome trifling abatement, by the very different picture and panegyric of the law as given by Trottman, oppo&s;ed to that I had been contemplating. But I had this very powerful con&s;olation: that, as Trottman knew very little of what I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the true principles of politics, it was high|ly probable he was no better acquainted with tho&s;e of law.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOVE a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed away, during which I received no word of intelligence concerning Olivia. At &s;ome moments I
<PB N="209" REF="214">
felt great affliction from this &s;u&s;pen&s;e: at others I collected my&s;elf and determined to pur&s;ue my plan with all the vigour in which it had been conceived.</P>
<P>In the interval, I wrote &s;everal times to Mr. Evelyn. To this I was prompted from the very nature of my engagements and &s;ituation. Be&s;ide which I had not forgotten my pamphlet again&s;t the Earl and the Bi&s;hop, that lay ready for publi|cation; though the acrimony of my feel|ings was much abated. The propriety of making the world acquainted with this affair was one of the &s;ubjects of my cor|re&s;pondence, with Mr. Evelyn: to whom I had the candour to &s;tate my own opi|nions and &s;en&s;ations, on one part; and, on the other, the objections that had been urged by Turl.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory I had given Mr. Evelyn of my&s;elf, I was impelled, as well by inclination as nece&s;&s;ity, to delineate the character of Turl; with which he
<PB N="210" REF="215">
could not but be charmed; and with his arguments and di&s;&s;ua&s;ions on this &s;ub|ject. With the&s;e the ideas of Mr. Evelyn entirely coincided. He wrote delightful letters; full of animation, feel|ing, and friend&s;hip; and his per&s;ua&s;ion therefore had the greater effect.</P>
<P>Wilmot concurred in the opinion of both; and, being thus pre&s;&s;ed by the men whom I mo&s;t loved and revered, I endeavoured to con&s;ign my re&s;entment and its effu&s;ions to oblivion, and to di&s;|mi&s;s the &s;ubject entirely from my mind.</P>
<P>At length, my &s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning Olivia found &s;ome, though far from a &s;atisfactory, relief.</P>
<P>As &s;he had paid no vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Wil|mot, the latter of cour&s;e had found no opportunity to deliver my letter. One evening, however, as I was &s;itting after tea with Mi&s;s Wilmot and her brother, a note came of which the following were the contents.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="216">"Mi&s;s Mowbray pre&s;ents her kind and tendere&s;t re&s;pects to Mi&s;s Wilmot, and informs her that &s;he has been in town for &s;ome &s;hort time. A&s;&s;ures her that her not having called is far indeed from any decline of former friend&s;hip, the &s;incerity of which is invariable: but that there are motives which prevent her, for the pre&s;ent, from the enjoyment of that &s;atisfaction. She would have been mo&s;t happy to have communicated her thoughts to Mi&s;s Wilmot in per&s;on: but &s;he is the &s;lave of circum&s;tances which, for family rea&s;ons and indeed from other motives, &s;he is forbidden to explain; and to which &s;he is obliged to &s;ubmit. She confides in the goodne&s;s and friend&s;hip of Mi&s;s Wilmot, who &s;he is well a&s;&s;ured will not mi&s;interpret that which is un|avoidable; and, cheri&s;hing the hope of a more favourable opportunity, wi&s;hes her all po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s: reque&s;ting that, if by any means in her power it can be in|crea&s;ed,
<PB N="212" REF="217">
Mi&s;s Wilmot will acquaint her with tho&s;e means: that &s;he may have the wi&s;hed-for occa&s;ion of proving the ardour and &s;incerity of her affections."</P>
<P>"Hertford-&s;treet, Nov. 17th."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wilmot gave me this note to read; and the commentary I immediately made was that, finding I was alive, the fear of a rencontre with me was the ob|&s;tacle to her vi&s;its.</P>
<P>They agreed that this was a very pro|bable &s;uppo&s;ition: but how far the aunt was any way concerned in it was matter of more uncertain conjecture. Mi&s;s Wilmot knew that Olivia had informed her aunt of the vi&s;its &s;he was before ac|cu&s;tomed to make; and, as her ideas concerning &s;incerity were delicately &s;trict, it was more than probable that &s;he had di&s;dained to conceal any of the circum|&s;tances with which &s;he her&s;elf was ac|quainted. I therefore thought it almo&s;t
<PB N="213" REF="218">
indubitable that &s;he had been no le&s;s frank on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion than was habitual to her on others; and time after|ward di&s;covered that my conclu&s;ions were right.</P>
<P>"With what unequal weapons," ex|claimed I, "do the lovers of truth and the adherents of hypocri&s;y contend!"</P>
<P>"They do indeed," replied Wilmot.</P>
<P>"But, contrary I believe to your &s;uppo|&s;ition, the former have infinitely the ad|vantage: for the latter &s;y&s;tematically deceive them&s;elves."</P>
<P>What was to be done? Was I to pur|&s;ue &s;ome covert mode of conveying my letter? Should I &s;end it openly? Or ought I to let it remain, and patiently wait the cour&s;e of events, which, by endeavouring to forward, I might but retard? Wilmot, who, though he had too much &s;ympathy to communicate all his fears, had but little expectation, judging from the failure of his own plans
<PB N="214" REF="219">
of the &s;ucce&s;s of mine, advi&s;ed me to the latter; and, perplexed as I was with doubt and apprehen&s;ion, I followed this advice.</P>
