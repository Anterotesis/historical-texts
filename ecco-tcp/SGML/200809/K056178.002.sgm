<P>O EMILY! How incon&s;i&s;tent is a heart in love! I entreated Mr. Mandeville not to write to me, and am chagrined at his too exact obedi|ence: I think if he loved as I do, he could not &s;o ea&s;ily obey me. He writes to Lady Anne, and though by my de&s;ire,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
I am a&s;hamed of my weakne&s;s&mdash;But I wi&s;h he wrote le&s;soften: there is an air of gaiety in his letters which offends me&mdash;He talks of balls, of parties with ladies&mdash;Perhaps I am unju&s;t, but the delicacy of my love is wound|ed by his knowing a moment's plea&s;ure in my ab&s;ence; to me all places are equal where he is not; all amu&s;ements without him are dull and ta&s;tele&s;s. Have not I an equal right to expect, Emily! He knows not how I love him.</P>
<P>Convinced that this mutual pa&s;&s;ion is the de&s;ignation of heaven to re&s;tore him to that affluence he lo&s;t by the partiality of an ance&s;tor, and the generous loyalty of his family, I give way to it without re|&s;erve; I regard my love as a virtue; I am proud of having di&s;tingui&s;hed his me|rit without tho&s;e trappings of wealth, which alone can attract common eyes. His idea is for ever before me; I think with tran&s;port of tho&s;e enchanting mo|ments&mdash;Emily,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
that week of tender con|fidence is all my life, the re&s;t is not worth numbering in my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>My father to-night gives a ball to Lord Melvin, with whom I am again, unwillingly, obliged to dance. I wi&s;h not to dance at all; to make this &s;acrifice to the mo&s;t be|loved of men: Why have I not courage to avow my &s;entiments, to declare he alone&mdash;This Lord Melvin too, I know not why, but I never &s;ee him without horror.</P>
<P>O Emily! How do all men &s;ink on the compari&s;on? He &s;eems of a &s;uperior rank of beings. Your Julia will never give her hand to another; &s;he &s;wears this to the dear bo&s;om of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This dete&s;ted Lord Melvin is at the door; he will not let me proceed; he tells me it is to a lover I am writing; he &s;ays
<PB N="4" REF="6">
this in a manner, and with a tone of voice&mdash;he looks at me with an earne&s;t|ne&s;s&mdash;Lady Anne has alarmed me&mdash;Should my father intend&mdash;yet why &s;hould I fear the mo&s;t cruel of all acts of tyranny from the mo&s;t tender and indulgent of pa|rents!</P>
<P>I feel a dejection of &s;pirits on this &s;ub|ject, which does injury to my father's goodne&s;s: perhaps it is no more than the natural effects of ab&s;ence on a tender and unexperienced heart.</P>
<P>Adieu! I am forced to fini&s;h my letter. All good angels guard and pre&s;erve my Emily!</P>

<HEAD>To the Earl of BELMONT.</HEAD>
<P>WITH all my affection for Lord T&mdash; I am hourly &s;hocked by that mo&s;t unworthy of all faults, his haughtine&s;s to inferior fortune, however di&s;tingui&s;hed by virtue, talents, or even the more &s;hining advantage of birth. Dre&s;s, equipage, and the over-bearing a&s;&s;urance which wealth in&s;pires, &s;trike him &s;o forci|bly, that there is no room in his &s;oul for that e&s;teem which is a debt to mode&s;t merit.</P>
<P>We had ye&s;terday to dine Mr. Herbert, one of the mo&s;t amiable men I ever &s;aw; his per&s;on was genteel, his countenance at once expre&s;&s;ive of genius and worth, which were rendered more touching to me, by that pen&s;ive look and irre&s;olute air, which are the con&s;tant attendants on an adver&s;e fortune. Lord T&mdash; returned his bow
<PB N="6" REF="8">
almo&s;t without looking at him, and con|tinued talking familiarly to a wretch with whom no gentleman would conver&s;e, were he not ma&s;ter of &s;ix thou&s;and a year: the whole company, in&s;tructed in his &s;ituation by the &s;upercilious air of the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, treated him with the &s;ame neglect, which I endeavoured to con&s;ole him for by every little civility in my power, and by confining my attention intirely to him; when we parted, he a&s;ked me to his hou&s;e with a look full of &s;en&s;ibility; an invita|tion I &s;hall take the fir&s;t opportunity of ac|cepting.</P>
<P>When the company were gone, I a&s;ked Lord T&mdash; the character of this &s;tranger. Why, really, &s;ays he, I believe he is in him&s;elf the mo&s;t e&s;timable man in my neighbourhood; of a good family too; but one mu&s;t mea&s;ure one's reception of people by the countenance the world &s;hews them; and he is too poor to be greatly ca|re&s;&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="9">
there. Be&s;ides I am not fond of be|ing acquainted with unhappy people, they are very apt to a&s;k favours.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I, my Lord, interrupt|ing him ha&s;tily, you can avow &s;entiments like the&s;e? Why are you rai&s;ed by Provi|dence above others? Why entru&s;ted with that wealth and con&s;equence which might make you a guardian angel to the unhappy? Where is my chai&s;e? I will return to Bel|mont, where affliction ever finds a ready audience; where adver&s;ity is &s;ure of being heard, though pomp and equipage wait.</P>
<P>Lord T&mdash; &s;miled at my earne&s;tne&s;s, and prai&s;ed the genero&s;ity of my &s;enti|ments, which he a&s;&s;ured me were his at my age: he owned he had been to blame; but in the world, &s;aid he, Harry, we are carried away by the torrent, and act wrong every moment mechanically meerly by &s;eeing others do the &s;ame. However I
<PB N="8" REF="10">
&s;tand corrected, and you &s;hall have no fu|ture rea&s;on to complain of me.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this with an air of good hu|mour which reconciled us, and has promi&s;ed to accompany me in my vi&s;it to Mr. Her|bert, which I have in&s;i&s;ted &s;hall be the fir&s;t we pay, and that he &s;hall beg his pardon for the behaviour of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, my Lord, that men who&s;e hearts are not bad, can avoid tho&s;e who&s;e characters do honor to their &s;pecies, only becau&s;e fortune denies them tho&s;e outward di&s;tinctions which wealth can give to the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;picable of man|kind?</P>
<P>Surely of all human vices, Pride is the mo&s;t dete&s;table!</P>

<HEAD>TO HENRY MANDEVILLE, E&s;quire.</HEAD>
<P>CAN I play with the anxiety of a ten|der heart? Certainly, or I &s;hould not be what I am, a coquet of the fir&s;t or|der: Setting a&s;ide the plea&s;ure of the thing, and I know few plea&s;anter amu&s;ements, Policy dictates this conduct; for there is no po&s;&s;ibility of keeping any of you with|out throwing the charms of dear variety into one's treatment of you: nothing cloys like continual &s;weets; a little acid is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t come from giving Lady Julia &s;ome excellent advice on the &s;ubject of her pa&s;&s;ion for you. Really, my dear, &s;aid I, you are extremely ab&s;urd to blu&s;h and look fooli&s;h about loving &s;o pretty a fellow as Harry Mandeville, hand&s;ome, well made, lively, elegant; in the true cla&s;&s;ical &s;tile,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
and approved by the connoi&s;&s;eurs, by Ma|dame le Comte&s;&s;e de &mdash; her&s;elf, whom I look upon to be the greate&s;t judge of male merit on the face of the globe.</P>
<P>It is not for loving him I am angry with you, but for entertaining &s;o ridiculous a thought as that of marrying him. You have only one rational &s;tep to take; marry Lord Melvin, who has title and fortune, requi&s;ites not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with in a hu&s;|band, and take Harry Mandeville for your Ceci&s;beo. The dear creature was im|men&s;ely di&s;plea&s;ed, as you, who know the romantic turn of her imagination, will ea&s;i|ly conceive.</P>
<P>O, I had almo&s;t forgot: yes, indeed, you have great right to give your&s;elf jealous airs: we have not heard of your coquetry with Mi&s;s Truman. My cor|re&s;pondent tells me there is no doubt of its being a real pa&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides, and
<PB N="11" REF="13">
that the Truman family have been making private enquiries into your fortune. I &s;hewed Lady Julia the letter, and you can|not conceive how prettily &s;he blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>But to be grave, I am afraid you have nothing to fear from Lord Melvin. You mu&s;t forgive my making u&s;e of this ex|pre&s;&s;ion; for, as I &s;ee no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ur|mounting the ob&s;tacles which oppo&s;e your union with Lady Julia, I am too much a friend to both, not to wi&s;h earne&s;tly, to break a connexion which has not a &s;ha|dow of hope to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>But a truce to this &s;ubject, which is not a plea&s;ant one to either of us.</P>
<P>I told you in my la&s;t I had &s;omething to &s;ay to you. As I am your confidente, you mu&s;t con&s;ent to be mine, having a little pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for your &s;ervices. You are to know, my dear Harry, that with all
<PB N="12" REF="14">
my conquetry I am as much in love as your|&s;elf, and with almo&s;t as little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s: this odious money is ab&s;olutely the bane of us true lovers, and always con|trives to &s;tand in our way.</P>
<P>My dear &s;pou&s;e then, who in the whole cour&s;e of our acquaintance did but one obliging thing, being kindly determined I &s;hould neither be happy with him nor with|out him, obligingly, tho' nobody knows this but my&s;elf, and the Caro Belville, made my jointure what it is, on condition I never married again: on ob&s;ervance of which condition it was to be in my power to give the e&s;tate to whoever I plea&s;ed at my death; but on a proof of my &s;uppo&s;ed future mar|riage, it was to go immediately to a niece of his, who at his death was in a convent in France, who is ignorant of this condi|tion, and who&s;e whole pre&s;ent fortune &s;carce amounts to fifteen hundred pounds. She is both in per&s;on and mind one of the
<PB N="13" REF="15">
mo&s;t lovely of women, and has an affection for me, which inclines me to think &s;he would come into mea&s;ures for my &s;ake, which I &s;hall make it her intere&s;t to acqui|e&s;ce in for her own.</P>
<P>Belville's fortune is extremely mode|rate; and if I marry him at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall not add a &s;hilling to it; his income will re|main in &s;tatu-quo, with the incumbrance of an indigent woman of quality, who&s;e af|fairs are a little derange, and among&s;t who&s;e virtues oeconomy was never one of the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable. He would with tran&s;|port marry me to-morrow, even on the&s;e hard conditions; but how little &s;hould I de&s;erve &s;o generous a pa&s;&s;ion, if I &s;uffered it to &s;educe him to his ruin? I have wrote to my niece to come to England, when I &s;hall tell her my pa&s;&s;ion for Belville, and pro|po&s;e to her a private agreement to divide the fortune, which will be forfeited to her on my marriage, and which it is in my
<PB N="14" REF="16">
power by living &s;ingle to deprive her of for ever. Incapable, however, of inju&s;tice I have at all events made a will, dividing it equally between her and Belville, if I die unmarried: I have a right to do this for the man I love, as my father left thirty thou&s;and pounds to Mr. Wilmot, which in equity ought to be regarded as mine, and which is all I de&s;ire, on the divi&s;ion: &s;he, therefore, by my will, has all &s;he ever can expect, even from the &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice: and &s;he can ne|ver, I think, he&s;itate between waiting till my death, and at my mercy, and receiving the utmo&s;t &s;he could hope then, at the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I have heard from the lady to whom I enclo&s;ed my letter, which &s;he has returned, my niece having left France a year ago, to accompany a relation into Italy. What I, therefore, have to a&s;k of you is, to endea|vour to find her out, by your Italian friends, as I will by mine at the &s;ame time, that I
<PB N="15" REF="17">
may write to her to return immediately to England, as I will not run the hazard of mentioning the &s;ubject in a letter. She is the daughter of the late colonel Ha&s;tings, once abroad in a public character, and is well known in Italy.</P>
<P>Belville is not at all in the &s;ecret of my &s;cheme; nor did I ever tell him I would marry him, though I &s;ometimes give him rea&s;on to hope.</P>
<P>I am too good a politician in love mat|ters ever to put a man out of doubt till half an hour before the ceremony. The moment a woman is weak enough to promi&s;e, &s;he &s;ets the heart of her lover at re&s;t; the chace, and of con&s;equence the plea|&s;ure, is at an end; and he has nothing to do but to &s;eek a new object, and begin the pur&s;uit over again.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
I tell you, but I tell it in confidence, that if I find Bell Ha&s;tings, if &s;he comes into my &s;cheme, and my mind does not change, I may, perhaps, do Bellville the honor. And yet, when I reflect on the matter; on the condition of the obligation, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;o long as ye both &s;hall live"</Q>&mdash;Je&s;u Maria! Only think of promi&s;ing to be of the &s;ame mind as long one lives. My dear Harry, people may talk as they will, but the thing is utterly impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD>TO GEORGE MORDAUNT, E&s;quire.</HEAD>
<P>I Have already told you I came hither with a view of engaging Lord T&mdash;'s intere&s;t in &s;upport of tho&s;e views, on which all my hopes of happine&s;s depend. The friend&s;hip he has ever profe&s;&s;ed for me has been warm as that of a father. I was con|tinually with him at Rome, and he there
<PB N="17" REF="19">
pre&s;t me to accept tho&s;e &s;ervices I then ne|ver expected to have occa&s;ion for. Till now content with my &s;ituation, love fir&s;t rai&s;ed in me the &s;pirit of ambition, and deter|mined me to accept tho&s;e offers. In a for|mer letter I told you I was going to follow Lord T&mdash; into the garden to communi|cate to him my purpo&s;e of pu&s;hing my for|tune in the world, on which I had before given general hints, which he &s;eemed to approve, as a kind of &s;pirit becoming a young man, warm with hope, and not de&s;|titute of merit.</P>
<P>On revolving my &s;cheme as I approach|ed him, it appeared &s;o romantic, &s;o void of all rational hope, that I had not re&s;olution to mention it, and determined at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pend it till better dige&s;ted, and more fitted to bear the cool eye of impartial rea&s;on: in the&s;e &s;entiments I &s;hould &s;till have remained, had not a letter from Lady Anne Wilmot, by giving me jealou&s;y, de|termined
<PB N="18" REF="20">
me not to defer one moment a de|&s;ign on which all my happine&s;s depended.</P>
<P>I, therefore, with &s;ome he&s;itation, this morning opened all my heart, and the real &s;tate of my circum&s;tances, to Lord T&mdash;, concealing only what related to Lady Julia. He heard me with great coolne&s;s, carele&s;sly lolling on a &s;ettee; his eyes fixed on a new Chine&s;e &s;ummer-hou&s;e, oppo&s;ite the window near which he &s;at, and made me the following an&s;wer; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your views, Mr. Mandeville, &s;eem rather ro|mantic, for a man who has no party con|nexions, and &s;o little parliamentary in|tere&s;t. However, you are of a good family, and there are things to be had in time if properly recommended. Have you no friend who would mention you to the mini&s;ter?"</Q> He then rang the bell ha&s;tily for his valet, and retired to dre&s;s, leaving me motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">
We met no more till dinner, when he treated me with a di&s;tant civility, the meaning of which was ea&s;ily under&s;tood. He apologized with an air of ceremony on his being forced to go for a fortnight to Scarborough, with a party, who being all &s;trangers, he was afraid would not be agreeable to me; but at his return he &s;hould be glad of the honor of &s;eeing me again. I bowed coldly, and took no other notice of what he &s;aid, than to order my chai&s;e immediately; on which he pre&s;&s;ed my &s;tay to-night, but in vain. The &s;ervants leaving the room, he was a little di&s;concerted, but ob&s;erved, he was &s;orry for me; my ca&s;e was really hard; he always thought my fortune much larger; wondered at my father's indi&s;cretion in educating me &s;o improperly&mdash;People ought to con|&s;ider their circum&s;tances&mdash;It was pity I had no friend&mdash;Lord Belmont, if he plea&s;ed, but he was &s;o ab&s;urdly fond of his independence.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
During this harangue I intirely reco|vered my pre&s;ence of mind, and with an air of great ea&s;e and unconcern told his Lord&s;hip, I was much obliged to him for curing me of a pur&s;uit &s;o improper for a man of my temper: that the liberal offers of &s;ervice he had formerly made me at Rome, had betrayed me into a fal&s;e opi|nion of the friend&s;hip of great men; but that I was now convinced of what value &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions are, and that they are only made where it &s;eems certain they will ne|ver be accepted. That it was impo&s;&s;ible his Lord&s;hip could judge properly of the conduct of a man of my father's character; that I was proud of being &s;on to the mo&s;t exalted and generous of mankind; and would not give up that honor to be fir&s;t mini&s;ter to the fir&s;t prince on earth. That I never &s;o &s;trongly felt the value of inde|pendence as at that moment, and did not wonder at the value Lord Belmont &s;et on &s;o ine&s;timable a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
I came away without waiting for an an|&s;wer, and &s;topped at an inn about ten miles off, where I am now waiting for one of my &s;ervants, whom I left behind to bring me a letter I expect to-day from Lady Anne Wilmot.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Mordaunt, what will become of your unhappy friend? The flattering hopes I fondly entertained are di&s;per&s;ed like a flitting cloud. Lord T&mdash;'s behaviour has removed the veil which love had &s;pread over the wildne&s;s of my de&s;ign, and convinced me that &s;ucce&s;s is impo&s;&s;ible. Where or to whom &s;hall I now apply? Lord T&mdash; was him on who&s;e friend&s;hip I mo&s;t depended; who&s;e power to &s;erve me was greate&s;t, and who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions gave me mo&s;t right to expect his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>I here for ever give up all views&mdash;Can I then calmly give up the hopes of Lady
<PB N="22" REF="24">
Julia? I will go back, confe&s;s my pa&s;&s;ion to Lord Belmont, and throw my&s;elf on that goodne&s;s who&s;e fir&s;t delight is that of making others happy. Yet can I hope he will give his daughter, the heire&s;s of &s;uch affluence&mdash;Di&s;intere&s;ted and noble as he is, the fal&s;e maxims of the world&mdash;Mordaunt, I am born to wretchedne&s;s&mdash;What have I gained by in&s;piring the mo&s;t angelic of wo|men with pity? I have doomed to mi&s;ery her for who&s;e happine&s;s I would &s;acrifice my life.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant I left at Lord T&mdash;, is this moment arrived; he has brought me a letter&mdash;I know not why, but my hand trembles, I have &s;carce power to break the &s;eal.</P>

<P>I have long, my dear Mr. Mandeville, &s;u&s;pected my Lord's de&s;ign in favour of Lord Melvin, of which there is not now the lea&s;t doubt. Our coming away from his father's, on his arrival, was a circum|&s;tance
<PB N="28" REF="30">
which then &s;truck me extreme|ly. Lady Julia's &s;tay there, on this &s;up|po&s;ition, would have been ill &s;uited to the delicacy of her &s;ex and rank. Yet I am a&s;toni&s;hed my Lord has not &s;ooner told her of it; but there is no accounting for the caprice of age. How &s;hall I tell my dear Mr. Mandeville my &s;entiments on this di&s;covery! How &s;hall I, without wounding a pa&s;&s;ion which bears no re&s;traint, hint to him my wi&s;hes, that he would &s;acrifice that love, which can only by its continuance make him wretched, to La|dy Julia's peace of mind! That he would him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;t her to conquer an inclination which is incompatible with the views which the mo&s;t indulgent of parents entertains for her happine&s;s? Views, the di&s;appointment of which, he has declared, will embitter his la&s;t hours! Make one generous effort, my amiable friend: it is glorious to con|quer where conque&s;t is mo&s;t difficult: think of Lord Belmont's friend&s;hip; of his al|mo&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="31">
parental care of your fortune; of the plea&s;ure with which he talks of your virtues; and it will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to continue to oppo&s;e that de&s;ign on which his hopes of a happy evening of life are founded. Would you deny a happy evening to that life to which thou&s;ands owe the felicity of theirs?</P>
<P>It is from you, and not Lady Julia, I expect this &s;acrifice: the con&s;ideration which will mo&s;t &s;trongly influence you to make it, will for ever prevent her; it pains me to wound your delicacy, by &s;aying I mean the difference of your fortunes. From a romantic genero&s;ity &s;he will think her&s;elf obliged to that per&s;everance, which the &s;ame genero&s;ity now calls loudly on you to decline. If you have greatne&s;s of mind to give up hopes which can never be accom|pli&s;hed, time and ab&s;ence may a&s;&s;i&s;t Lady Julia's filial &s;weetne&s;s, and bring her to a compliance with her father's will. Believe,

that whil&s;t I write, my heart melts with com|pa&s;&s;ion for you both; and that nothing but the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip could have urged me to &s;o painful a ta&s;k.</P>

<P>O Mordaunt! till now I was never truly wretched. I have not even a glimp&s;e of hope remaining. I mu&s;t give up the only wi&s;h for which life is worth my care, or embitter the la&s;t hours of the man, who with unequalled genero&s;ity has pleaded my cau&s;e again&s;t him&s;elf, and declined a noble acqui&s;ition of fortune, that it might give con&s;equence, and, as he thought, happine&s;s to me.</P>

<P>I have wrote to Lady Julia, and am more calm: I have mentioned Lady Anne's

que&s;t.

<P>EMILY HOWARD came la&s;t night. La|dy Julia and &s;he are reading natural hi&s;tory with my Lord, and examining but|terflies wings in a micro&s;cope; a pretty in|nocent amu&s;ement to keep young ladies out of mi&s;chief. I wi&s;h my Lord had thought of it &s;ooner, it might have been of great u&s;e to Lady Julia: if one is but amu&s;ed, it is of no great con&s;equence whether by a butterfly or a lover.</P>
<P>Va&s;tly &s;evere that la&s;t &s;entence; it mu&s;t be allowed I have a pretty genius for &s;atire.</P>
<P>My Lord certainly intends Lady Julia for Lord Melvin. I have wrote Harry a ridi|culous wi&s;e letter, per&s;wading him to &s;acri|fi&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="36">
his own pa&s;&s;ion to my Lord's caprice; and giving him advice, which I &s;hould hate him, if I thought him capable of fol|lowing. How ea&s;y it is to be wi&s;e for any body but ones &s;elf! I &s;uppo&s;e Harry could with great calmne&s;s preach on the impru|dence of my attachment to you.</P>
<P>We are going to a &s;trolling play to-night. My Lord encourages diver&s;ions on his e&s;tate, on the &s;ame principle that a wi&s;e prince protects the fine arts, to keep his people at home.</P>
<P>We had a family to dine here ye&s;terday, who are very agreeable people, and to whom my Lord &s;hewed a particular atten|tion. Mr. Barker, the father is the mo&s;t bearable man I have &s;een in this country; and the daughters va&s;tly above the &s;tile of the mi&s;&s;es here: Lady Belmont intends to take them this winter with her to town,

<P>Adieu! I am peevi&s;h beyond mea&s;ure, and &s;carce know what I would be at. Have you never the&s;e kind of feels? Never fret|ful, you cannot tell why? It is well for you, you are not here: a lover and a favou|rite lap-dog have a dreadful life on the&s;e occa&s;ions; or indeed any animal one can u&s;e ill with impunity.

<P>WE have been all extremely bu&s;y to-day, celebrating a harve&s;t-home; a long proce&s;&s;ion of our village youths, all dre&s;t gaily in fine &s;hirts, adorned with ribbands, paired with the hand&s;ome&s;t of the country girls, in white jackets and pet|ticoats, garlands of flowers and wheat-ears on their heads, their rakes &s;treaming with various coloured ribbands, which glittered in the &s;unbeams, preceded the harve&s;t cart; on which, in a bower of green boughs, &s;tood a beautiful little girl, dre&s;t in the rural &s;tile, with inimitable elegance, by the hands of Lady Julia her&s;elf. The gay proce&s;&s;ion walked &s;lowly through the vil|lage; a tabor and pipe playing before them, till they came before the hou&s;e, where they danced a thou&s;and little ru&s;tic dances, the novelty of which charmed me extremely:
<PB N="38" REF="40">
they then adjourned to the hall, where a plentiful fea&s;t was provided, and where the whole village were that night my Lord's gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>Lord Belmont is extremely fond of all the&s;e old cu&s;toms, and will &s;uffer none of them to be left off on his e&s;tate. The pro&s;pect of this fe&s;tivity, he &s;ays, chears them in their labor, and is a laudable tri|bute of gladne&s;s to that beneficent being, to who&s;e bounty we owe the full reward of our toil, the plenteous harve&s;t, and who rejoices in the happine&s;s of his creatures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;ays my Lord, all the&s;e amu&s;e|ments encourage a &s;pirit of matrimony, and encrea&s;e the number of my people.</P>
<P>And pray, my dear Lord, do they en|courage no other &s;pirit!</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">
No, Madam; Lady Belmont's anger and mine would, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, they know, contrary to that of the world, fall chiefly where it ought, on the &s;educer, who would be for ever expelled my e&s;tate, the heavie&s;t puni&s;hment I could po&s;&s;ibly inflict. Then, as I am a declared enemy to intere&s;ted mar|riages, the young people are allowed to chu&s;e for them&s;elves, which removes the temptation to vice, which is generally cau&s;ed by the &s;hameful avarice of parents.</P>
<P>Our example too is of great &s;ervice, and and allures them to a regular behaviour; they think that mu&s;t be the happie&s;t life, which we, who have the power of chu&s;ing, prefer; and therefore it is the fa&s;hion among&s;t them to be regular, and &s;eek their happine&s;s, as we do, at home.</P>
<P>I believe my Lord is right: I am well plea&s;ed too, he throws the blame on you he wretches, and excu&s;es the poor la&s;&s;es.
<PB N="40" REF="42">
In the eye of the world it is to be &s;ure <Q REND="inline">"toute au contraire;"</Q> but my Lord and Lady Belmont are &s;o &s;ingular as to &s;ee with their own eyes.</P>
<P>Adieu! We are all to go down one dance with the villagers, and I hear the ta|bor and pipe.</P>
<P>O Heavens! a coach and &s;ix, the Man|deville livery; a running footman; it mu&s;t be Lady Mary; I will enquire; it is her|&s;elf; my Lord flies to receive her in the court; Lady Belmont and Lady Julia are at the door; &s;he alights; I never &s;aw her before; her figure is &s;triking, full of digni|ty, and that grace which is almo&s;t lo&s;t in this generation; &s;he enters the hou&s;e lean|ing on my Lord; I am grieved Harry is gone; I wi&s;hed her to be &s;ome time with him; &s;he only ju&s;t &s;aw him as he came through London in his way to Belmont.</P>

He &s;aw me, and &s;pringing eagerly from his hor&s;e, &s;ent to know if I would admit him. He came, and after expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urprize at &s;eeing me there, on my telling him I had left Lord T&mdash;'s, and waited there a few days for letters, he in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;pending that time at his hou&s;e, in a man|ner which it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to refu&s;e. As we rode, he apologized for the entertain|ment
<PB N="42" REF="44">
I &s;hould meet with; wi&s;hed for a larger &s;hare of the gifts of fortune that he might receive his friends in a manner more &s;uited to his de&s;ires; but &s;aid, if he knew me, the heart of the ho&s;t was all I &s;hould care for; and that I &s;hould reli&s;h the home|ly meat of chearful friend&s;hip, as well as the &s;plendid profu&s;ion of luxury and pride.</P>
<P>We arrived at a neat hou&s;e, with a little romantic garden behind it, where we were received by Mrs. Herbert with that ho&s;pi|table air which is in&s;eparable from real be|nevolence of heart. Her per&s;on was ex|tremely plea&s;ing, and her dre&s;s elegantly plain. She had a little boy &s;itting by her, lovely and playful as a Cupid.</P>
<P>Neatne&s;s and propriety pre&s;ided at our frugal meat; and after a little de&s;ert of ex|cellent fruit from their garden, Mr. Her|bert took me the tour of his e&s;tate, which con&s;i&s;ts of about &s;eventy acres, which he culti|vates

him&s;elf, and has embelli&s;hed with every thing that can make it lovely: all has the appearance of content and peace: I ob|&s;erved this to him, and added, that I infi|nitely envied his happine&s;s. He &s;topped and looked earne&s;tly at me; I am indeed, &s;aid he, happy in many things, and though my fortune is greatly below my birth and hopes, I am not in want; things may be better, till then I bear them as I can: my wife, who&s;e worth outweighs all prai&s;e, combats our ill fate with a &s;pirit I cannot always imitate; for her, Mr. Mandeville, for her, I feel with double keenne&s;s the &s;tings of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved him too much affected to pur|&s;ue the &s;ubject farther, I therefore changed it, and returned to the hou&s;e: but I will not leave him till I am in&s;tructed how to draw the worm of di&s;content from one of the worthie&s;t of human bo&s;oms.</P>

<P>I AM charmed with Lady Mary; her ad|dre&s;s is ea&s;y, polite, attentive; &s;he is tall, brown, well made, and perfectly graceful; her air would in&s;pire awe, if not &s;oftened by the utmo&s;t &s;weetne&s;s and affability of behaviour. She has great vivacity in her looks and manner; her hair is quite white; her eyes have lo&s;t their lu&s;tre; yet it is ea&s;y to &s;ee &s;he has been very hand&s;ome; her hand and arm are yet lovely, of which &s;he is not a little vain: take her for all in all, &s;he is the fine&s;t ruin I ever beheld.</P>
<P>She is full of anecdotes of the queen's time, cho&s;e with judgment, and told with &s;pi|rit,
<PB N="45" REF="47">
which make her conver&s;ation infinitely amu&s;ing. She has been &s;aying &s;o many fine things of Harry, who by the way &s;trongly re&s;embles her, that I begin to think the good old lady has a matrimonial de&s;ign upon him : really not ami&s;s &s;uch a &s;cheme; fine remains, an affluent fortune, and as to years, eighty is ab&s;olutely the be&s;t age I know for a wife, except eighteen. She thinks him, what is extremely in his favor, very like her brother, who was killed at the battle of Almanza.</P>
<P>She has the talkativene&s;s of age, which, where there is &s;en&s;e and knowledge of the world, I do not di&s;like; &s;he is learned in genealogy, and can tell you not only the in|termarriages, but the family virtues and vices of every ancient hou&s;e in the king|dom; as to the modern ones, &s;he does not think them worth &s;tudying. I am high in her favour, becau&s;e my blood has never been contaminated by a city marriage. She
<PB N="46" REF="48">
tells me the women of my family have always been famous for a certain ea&s;e and bon air, which &s;he is glad to &s;ee is not lo&s;t; and that my grand-mother was the greate&s;t or|nament of Queen Mary's court.</P>
<P>She has a great contempt for the pre&s;ent race of beauties, &s;ays the very idea of grace is almo&s;t lo&s;t, and that we &s;ee nothing now but meer pretty women; that &s;he can only account for this, by &s;uppo&s;ing the trifling turn of their minds gives an in&s;ignificance to their per&s;ons; and that &s;he would ad|vi&s;e them to learn to think and act, in or|der to their being able to look and move, with dignity. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You, nephew, &s;he &s;ays, who remember each bright Churchill of the Galaxy, will readily come into my opi|nion."</Q> She does me the honor, how|ever, to &s;ay I am the mo&s;t graceful wo|man &s;he has &s;een &s;ince the Queen's time.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49">
She is a great politician, and &s;omething inclined to be a tory, though &s;he profe&s;&s;es perfect impartiality; loves the king, and idolizes the queen, becau&s;e &s;he thinks &s;he &s;ees in her the &s;weet affability &s;o admired in her favourite Queen Mary&mdash;For|gives the cits for their oppo&s;ition to peace, becau&s;e they get more money by war, the criterion by which they judge of every thing: but is amazed nobles, born guardians of the ju&s;t rights of the throne, the fountain of all their honors, &s;hould join the&s;e in|tere&s;ted Change-alley politicians, and en|deavour, from private pique, to weaken the hands of their &s;overeign: But adds, with a &s;igh, that mankind were always alike, and that it was ju&s;t &s;o in the Queen's Time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, pray nephew, this Canada;&mdash;I remember when Hill was &s;ent again&s;t it in the Queen's time, it was thought of great con&s;equence; and 2 or 3 years ago pamph|lets were wrote, I am told, by men very well

<HEAD>TO GEORGE MORDAUNT, E&s;quire.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;till with Mr. Herbert, who&s;e ge|nius, learning, and goodne&s;s of heart, make him an honor to human nature it&s;elf: I &s;hall never know peace till I find a way to render his &s;ituation more worthy of his character.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
It was with great difficulty I drew from him the following &s;hort account of him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is nothing in my pa&s;t life but what is, I fear, too u&s;ual to be worth re|lating. Warmth of temper, and the va|nity of youth, &s;educed me into a circle of company not to be kept up by one of my fortune, at a le&s;s price than ruin; and the &s;ame vanity, with inexperience, and a fal&s;e opinion of mankind, betrayed me into views not le&s;s de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>My father unhappily died when I was about nineteen, leaving me at college, ma&s;|ter of my own actions, of the little e&s;tate you &s;ee, and of four thou&s;and pounds; a &s;um I then thought inexhau&s;tible. The reputa|tion of &s;uch a &s;um in my own power, drew about me all the worthle&s;s young men of &s;a&s;hion in the univer&s;ity, who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions and examples led me into a train of expence
<PB N="51" REF="53">
to which my fortune was far from being equal; they flattered tho&s;e talents of which I thought but too well my&s;elf, and ea&s;ily per&s;uaded me I only wanted to be known in the great world to ri&s;e to what height I plea&s;ed. I accompanied them to town, full of the idea of rai&s;ing my fortune, to which they a&s;&s;ured me nothing &s;o much contri|buted as the appearance of being perfectly at ea&s;e. To this end I launched into every expence they propo&s;ed, dre&s;s, equipage, play, and every fa&s;hionable extravagance. I was well received every where, and thought my de&s;igns in a pro&s;perous way. I found my fortune however decaying at the end of two years, but had not courage to enquire into particulars, till drawing upon my banker for money to pay &s;ome debts I had unwarily contracted, he told me he had already paid the whole.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before he could con|vince me of this; but finding his accounts
<PB N="52" REF="54">
had all the appearance of exactne&s;s, I was obliged to acquie&s;ce, and went home in an agony of de&s;pair. Unable to quit a way of life which was become habitual, and which it was now impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport without di&s;hone&s;ty, there is no de&s;cribing my feel|ings. After revolving a thou&s;and different &s;chemes in my imagination, I determined to conceal the &s;ituation of my affairs, to &s;ell my e&s;tate, and before that money was gone, pre&s;s my great friends to &s;erve me.</P>
<P>I applied to my banker, who undertook to &s;end me a purcha&s;er; but before I had compleated my de&s;ign I received by the po&s;t a bank note of five hundred pounds, the &s;um I was indebted in town; with a letter, in a hand unknown to me, repre&s;enting in the mo&s;t delicate manner, the imprudence of my pa&s;t conduct, the madne&s;s of my views, and the certain con&s;equences of my parting with this my la&s;t &s;take: intreating me by the memory of my parents, to pre|&s;erve

<P>Melted with this genero&s;ity, &s;truck with the ju&s;t reproof, yet chained down to that world which had undone me; convinced, yet irre&s;olute; I &s;truggled with my own own heart to determine on retiring into the country; but to po&s;tpone as long as po&s;&s;ible a retreat, which I could not bear to think of, re&s;olved fir&s;t to try my great friends, and be certain of what I had to hope for. I re|pre&s;ented to them the nece&s;&s;ity of immedi|ately attempting in earne&s;t to pu&s;h my for|tune, and pre&s;&s;ing them clo&s;ely, found their promi&s;es were air. They talked in general terms of their e&s;teem for me, of my merit, and each of them expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t de|&s;ire of &s;eeing me &s;erved by any means but his own. As a means to animate their lan|guid friend&s;hip, I di&s;covered to them the real &s;tate of my affairs; and from that mo|ment found my&s;elf avoided by them all;
<PB N="54" REF="56">
they dropped me by degrees; were never at home when I called; and at length cea&s;ed even to bow to me in public; a&s;hamed of their own ba&s;ene&s;s in thus cru|elly de&s;erting me, after leading me into ruin, mo&s;t of them &s;ought to excu&s;e it by blackening my character; whil&s;t the be&s;t of them affected coldly to pity me, as a vain fooli&s;h fellow, who had undone him&s;elf by forgetting his own primeval &s;ituation, and arrogantly pre&s;uming to live with them.</P>
<P>Burning with indignation, I determined at once to break the bands which held me captive; I &s;old my equipage, di&s;charged my debts, and came down to this place, re|&s;olved to find out to whom I had been &s;o obliged; and, by living on half my income, to repay this generous benefactor.</P>
<P>I took lodgings in a farm-hou&s;e, and &s;oon found that peace of mind to which I
<PB N="55" REF="57">
had long been a &s;tranger. I tried every method to find out to whom I was indebted for an act of &s;uch exalted friend&s;hip, but in vain; till one day, a relation being pre|&s;ent, of whom I had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion, I re|lated the &s;tory, as of another, keeping my eyes fixed upon him; he remained perfect|ly unmoved; but happening to turn my head, I &s;aw a confu&s;ion in the air of a young lady in the room, with whom I had been bred in the greate&s;t intimacy, which excited all my attention. She &s;aw me ob|&s;erve her, and a blu&s;h over&s;pread her cheeks, which convinced me I had found the object of my &s;earch. I changed the &s;ubject; and the next morning made her a vi&s;it, when I with great difficulty drew from her a confe&s;&s;ion, that having long had a tender e&s;teem for me, &s;he had, by a friend in a town, watched all my actions: that my banker had applied to that very friend to purcha&s;e my e&s;tate; on which, &s;eeing me on the brink of ab&s;olute ruin, &s;he
<PB N="56" REF="58">
had taken what appeared to her the mo&s;t probable means to prevent it; and was &s;o happy as to &s;ee &s;he had &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay I need not tell you this noble creature was my dear Mrs. Herbert, the &s;malle&s;s of who&s;e fortune added infinitely to the genero&s;ity of the action, what &s;he had &s;ent me being within a trifle her all.</P>
<P>I loved, I addre&s;&s;ed her, and at length, was &s;o happy as to call her mine. Ble&s;t in the mo&s;t exalted pa&s;&s;ion for each other, a pa&s;&s;ion which time has rather encrea&s;ed than abated, the narrowne&s;s of our circum|&s;tances is the only ill we have to complain of; even this we have borne with chearful|ne&s;s in the hope of happier days. A late accident has, however, broke in upon that tranquillity with which Heaven has hitherto ble&s;t us. It is now about &s;ix months &s;ince a lady, who tenderly e&s;teemed us both, &s;ent for me, and acquainted me &s;he had
<PB N="57" REF="59">
procured for me of a gentleman, who&s;e fa|mily had been obliged to her, a living of above three hundred pounds a year, in a beautiful &s;ituation; and de&s;ired I would im|mediately take orders. As I was originally educated with a view to the church, I con|&s;ented with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, ble&s;&s;ing that Heaven, which had thus rewarded my Sophia's generous affection, and given us all that was wanting to compleat our hap|pine&s;s. I &s;et out for London with an exult|ing heart; where, after being ordained, I re|ceived the pre&s;entation, and went down to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The hou&s;e was large and elegant, and betrayed me into furni&s;hing it rather better than &s;uited my pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances; but as I determined on the utmo&s;t frugality for &s;ome years, I thought this of little con&s;equence. I &s;et men to work in the garden; and wrote my wife an account of our new re&s;idence, which made her eager to ha&s;ten her removal. The day of my coming for my family was fixed,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
when my patron came down to his &s;eat, which was within &s;ight of the rectory; I waited on him, and found him &s;urrounded by wretches, to whom it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to give the name of human; profligate, abandoned, lo&s;t even to the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame; their conver&s;ation wounded rea&s;on, virtue, politene&s;s, and all that mankind agree to hold &s;acred. My patron, the wealthy heir of a We&s;t Indian, was rai&s;ed above them, only by fortune, and a &s;uperior degree of ignorance and &s;avage in&s;en&s;ibility. He re|ceived me with an in&s;olence, which I found great difficulty in &s;ubmitting to: and after &s;ome brutal general reflexions on the cler|gy, dared to utter expre&s;&s;ions relating to the beauty of my wife, which fired my &s;oul with indignation; breathle&s;s with rage, I had not power to reply: when one of the company &s;peaking low to him, he an&s;wered aloud, Hark, you Herbert, this blockhead thinks a par&s;on a gentleman; and wonders
<PB N="59" REF="61">
at my treating, as I plea&s;e, a fellow who eats my bread.</P>
<P>I will &s;ooner want bread, Sir, &s;aid I, ri&s;ing, than owe it to the mo&s;t contempti|ble of mankind. Your living is once more at your di&s;po&s;al; I re&s;ign all right to it be|fore this company.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of having acted as I ought, &s;welled my bo&s;om with con&s;cious delight, and &s;upported me till I reached home; when my heart &s;unk at the thought of what my Sophia might feel from the di&s;appoint|ment. Our affairs too were a little em|bara&s;&s;ed, from which mi&s;ery I had hoped to be &s;et free, in&s;tead of which my debts were encrea&s;ed. Mr. Mandeville, if you never knew the horrors of being in debt, you can form no idea of what it is to breathe the air at the mercy of another; to labor, to &s;truggle to be ju&s;t, whil&s;t the
<PB N="60" REF="62">
cruel world are loading you with the guilt of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I entered the hou&s;e, filled with horrors not to be conceived. My wife met me with eager enquiries about our future re&s;idence; and with repeated thanks to that God who had thus graciou&s;ly be&s;towed on us the means of doing ju&s;tice to all the world. You will imagine what I felt at that moment: in|&s;tead of replying, I related to her the treat|ment I had met with, and the character of him to whom we were to be obliged; and a&s;ked her, what &s;he would wi&s;h me to do? Re&s;ign the living, &s;aid &s;he, and tru&s;t to that Heaven who&s;e goodne&s;s is over all his creatures. I embraced her with tears of tender tran&s;port, and told her I had already done it. We wrote to the lady to who&s;e friend&s;hip we had been obliged for the pre&s;entation; and &s;he had the greatne&s;s of mind not to di&s;approve my conduct. We have &s;ince practi&s;ed a more &s;evere frugality,
<PB N="61" REF="63">
which we are determined not to relax till what we owe is fully di&s;charged: time will, we hope, bring about this end, and re|move the load which now oppre&s;&s;es my heart. Determined to tru&s;t to Heaven and our own indu&s;try, and to aim at indepen|dence alone, I have avoided all acquaintance which could interfere with this only rational plan: but Lord T&mdash; &s;eeing me at the hou&s;e of a nobleman, who&s;e virtues do honor to his rank; and imagining my fortune ea&s;y from my cordial reception there, in|vited me earne&s;tly to his &s;eat; where, hav|ing, as I &s;uppo&s;e, been &s;ince undeceived as to my &s;ituation, you were a witne&s;s of his un|worthy treatment of me; of one de&s;cended from a family noble as his own, liberally educated, with a &s;pirit equally above mean|ne&s;s and pride, and a heart which feels too &s;en&s;ibly to be happy in a world like this.</P>
<P>Oh Mr. Mandeville! What can you think of him, who, in&s;tead of pouring out his
<PB N="62" REF="64">
&s;oul in thankfulne&s;s to Heaven for tho&s;e advantages he enjoys by its goodne&s;s above his fellow-creatures, makes u&s;e of them to wound the bo&s;om of the wretched, and add double bitterne&s;s to the cup of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>The real evils of a narrow fortune are trifling; its wor&s;t pangs &s;pring from the unfeeling cruelty of others; it is not always that philo&s;ophy can rai&s;e us above the proud man's contumely, or tho&s;e thou&s;and in&s;ults<Q><L>" Which patient merit of th' unworthy takes."</L></Q></P>
<P>You, Mr. Mandeville, are young, and full of probity; your own heart will mi&s;|lead you, by drawing too flattering a pic|ture of others; the world is gay before you; and blinded by pro&s;perity, you have never yet &s;een it as it is.

<P>A Pretty &s;entimental letter your la&s;t, and would make an admirable figure in a true hi&s;tory of Celadon and Urania. Ab&s;olutely, though, Belville, for people who have &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;o little pro&s;pect of coming together in an honorable way, we are a mo&s;t extraordinary pair of lovers. And yet the world&mdash;apropos to the world, a French author I am reading, &s;ays, a wi&s;e writer, to divert the fury of critici&s;m from his works, &s;hould throw it now and then an indi&s;cretion in his conduct to play with, as &s;eamen do a tub to the whale.</P>
<P>Do not you think this might be a u&s;e|ful hint to us beauties? If I treat the good old ladies &s;ometimes with a little impru|dence
<PB N="69" REF="71">
in regard to you, my complexion may e&s;cape the better for it.</P>
<P>We are ju&s;t returned from a party on the water, which, like mo&s;t concerted parties, turned out exceedingly dull: we had gilded barges, excellent mu&s;ick, an elegant repa&s;t, and all that could invite plea&s;ure among&s;t us; but whether her lady&s;hip be a true coquette, flying fa&s;te&s;t when pur&s;ued, or what is the rea&s;on I know not, but certain it is, one &s;eldom finds her when one goes to &s;eek her; her vi&s;its are generally &s;pon|taneous and unexpected; &s;he rejects all in|vitations, and comes upon you in her own way, by &s;urprize. I &s;et off in high &s;pirits, my heart beating with expectation, and ne|ver pa&s;t a more languid day; I fancied every moment would be plea&s;anter, but found the la&s;t hour as &s;piritle&s;s as the fir&s;t.

<P>I mi&s;&s;ed my &s;weet Harry exceedingly, for though not a lover, he is a divine fel|low, and there is &s;omething va&s;tly amu&s;ing in having &s;o agreeable an object before one's eyes.</P>

came to the door, who is a famous profici|ent in &s;candal, a treat I am ab&s;olutely de|prived of at Belmont, I changed my mind, and a&s;ked her to accompany me, that I might be amu&s;ed with the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of all the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>She had torn to pieces half a dozen of the prettie&s;t women about us, when pa&s;&s;ing through a little village about &s;ix miles from Belmont, I was &s;truck with the extreme neatne&s;s of a &s;mall hou&s;e and garden near the road; there was an elegant plainne&s;s in the air of it, which plea&s;ed me &s;o much, that I pulled the &s;tring, and ordered the coachman to &s;top, that I might examine it more at lei&s;ure. I was going to bid him drive on, when two women came out of an aroor, one of whom in&s;tantly engaged all my attention.</P>
<P>Imagine to your&s;elf in &s;uch a place all that is graceful and lovely in woman; an
<PB N="74" REF="76">
elegance of form and habit; a dignity of deportment; an air of delicate languor and &s;en&s;ibility, which won the heart at a look; a complexion inclining to pale; the fine&s;t dark eyes; with a countenance in which a mode&s;t &s;orrow and dignified dejec|tion gave the &s;tronge&s;t indications of &s;uffer|ing merit.</P>
<P>My companion &s;eeing the apparent par|tiality, with which I beheld this amiable object, began to give me a hi&s;tory of her, embittered by all the virulence of malice; which, however, amounted to no more, than that &s;he was a &s;tranger, and that as nobody knew who &s;he was, they generou&s;ly concluded &s;he was one who&s;e intere&s;t it was not to be known.</P>
<P>They now drew nearer to us; and the charming creature rai&s;ing her eyes, and then fir&s;t &s;eeing us, exclaimed, Good Hea|ven! Lady Anne Wilmot! Is it po&s;&s;ible!
<PB N="75" REF="77">
I now regarded her more attentively, and though greatly changed &s;ince I &s;aw her, knew her to be Bell Ha&s;tings, Mr. Wilmot's niece, whom I had been long endeavouring to find. I &s;prung from the chariot to meet her, and need not tell you my tran&s;port at &s;o unexpected a rencounter.</P>
<P>After the common enquiries on meeting, I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize at finding her there, with a gentle reproach at her un|kindne&s;s in being in England without letting me know it. She blu&s;hed, and &s;eem|ed embarra&s;&s;ed at what I &s;aid; on which I changed the &s;ubject, and pre&s;&s;ed her to ac|company me immediately to Belmont, the place on earth where merit like hers was mo&s;t &s;ure of finding its be&s;t reward, e&s;teem. She declined this propo&s;al in a manner which convinced me &s;he had &s;ome particular rea&s;on for refu&s;ing, which I doubted not her taking a proper time to explain, and therefore gave it up for the

pre&s;ent. I in&s;i&s;ted, however, on her pro|mi&s;ing to go with me to town; and that nothing but a matrimonial engagement &s;hould &s;eparate her from me.

<P>An hour pa&s;&s;ed without my having thought of my meagre companion at the gate. I was not &s;orry for having acci|dentally mortified the envious wretch for her &s;pite to poor Bell. However, as I would not de&s;ignedly be &s;hocking, I &s;ent to her, and apologized for my neglect, which I excu&s;ed from my joy at meeting unex|pectedly with a relation for whom I had the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip.

Am I not mo&s;t happy? Her idea is perpetually before me; when

<P>Oh! Mordaunt! what tran&s;port do I find in this &s;weet delirium of love! How ea|gerly do I expect the return of evening! Could I but once again behold her! Once again &s;wear eternal pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;I have a thou&s;and things to &s;ay.</P>

<P>I Have this moment a letter from Bell Ha&s;tings, which I &s;end you: I wi&s;h her here, yet know not how to pre&s;s it, after &s;o rational an apology.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Lady ANNE WILMOT.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I ab&s;olutely accept or refu&s;e your lady&s;hip's generous invitation, al|low me to account to you for my being in a place where you &s;o little expected to find me, but which I am convinced you will ac|quie&s;ce in my continuing in, when you know the motives which induced me to make choice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">
When my uncle married your lady&s;hip, you may remember he left me in a convent at Paris, where I &s;taid till his death. I &s;hould then have returned, but having con|tracted a very tender friend&s;hip for a young lady of the fir&s;t quality in England, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me to continue there till her return, which was fixed for the year following. About three months before we intended to leave Paris, her brother arrived, on which occa&s;ion &s;he left the convent, and went to &s;pend her remaining time with an aunt who then re&s;ided in France, and who being told I had &s;taid the la&s;t year in complai&s;ance to her amiable niece, in&s;i&s;ted on my accom|panying her: to &s;pare a long narrative of common events, the brother of my friend became pa&s;&s;ionately in love with me, and I was &s;o unhappy as to be too &s;en&s;ible to his tenderne&s;s: he intreated me to conceal our attachment from his &s;i&s;ter for the pre&s;ent; profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t honorable de&s;igns; told me he did not doubt of bringing his father to
<PB N="83" REF="85">
con&s;ent to a marriage to which there could be no objection that was not founded in the mo&s;t fordid avarice, and on which the happine&s;s of his life depended.</P>
<P>The time of our intended return to Eng|land drawing near, he employed, and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, the power he had over my heart, to influence my acceptance of an invitation given me, by a friend of my mother's, to accompany her to Florence, where I pro|mi&s;ed to &s;tay till his return from Rome.</P>
<P>Too much in love, as he &s;aid, and I weakly believed, to &s;upport a longer ab|&s;ence, he came in a few months to Florence; we were then in the country with a Floren|tine nobleman, who&s;e lady was related to my friend, to whom he was &s;trongly recom|mended, and who gave him an invitation to his villa; which I need not tell you he accepted. We &s;aw each other continually, but under a re&s;traint, which, whil&s;t it en|crea&s;ed
<PB N="84" REF="86">
our mutual pa&s;&s;ion, was equally painful to both. At length he contrived to give me a letter, pre&s;&s;ing me to &s;ee him alone in the garden at an hour he mentioned. I went, and found the mo&s;t beloved of men waiting for me in a grove of oranges. He &s;aw me at a di&s;tance: I &s;topped by an involuntary impul&s;e; he ran to me, he approached me with a tran&s;port which left me no room to doubt of his affection.</P>
<P>After an hour &s;pent in vows of everla&s;t|ing love, he pre&s;&s;ed me to marry him pri|vately, which I refu&s;ed with an air of firm|ne&s;s but little &s;uited to the &s;tate of my heart, and prote&s;ted no con&s;ideration &s;hould ever induce me to give him my hand with|out the con&s;ent of his father.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed great re&s;entment of a re&s;o|lution which he affirmed was incon&s;i&s;tent with a real pa&s;&s;ion; pretended jealou&s;y of a young nobleman in the hou&s;e, and artfully
<PB N="85" REF="87">
hinted at returning immediately to Eng|land; then &s;oftening his voice, implored my compa&s;&s;ion, vowed he could not live without me, and &s;o varied his behaviour from rage to the mo&s;t &s;educing &s;oftne&s;s, that the fear of di&s;plea&s;ing him, who was dearer to me than life, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the tender per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of well di&s;&s;embled love, &s;o far prevailed over the dictates of rea&s;on and &s;trict honor, that unable to re|&s;i&s;t his de&s;pair, I con&s;ented to a clande&s;tine marriage: I then in&s;i&s;ted on returning im|mediately to the hou&s;e, to which he con|&s;ented, though unwillingly, and leaving me with all the exulting raptures of &s;ucce&s;sful love, went to Florence to prepare a prie&s;t to unite us, promi&s;ing to return with him in the morning: the next day pa&s;&s;ed, and the next, without my hearing of him: a whole week elap&s;ed in the &s;ame manner: convinced of his affection my fears were all for his &s;afety, my imagination pre&s;ented danger in every form, and no longer able to &s;upport
<PB N="86" REF="88">
terrors of my mind filled with a thou&s;and dreadful ideas, I &s;ent a &s;ervant to enquire for him at the hou&s;e where he lodged, who brought me word he had left Florence the very morning on which I expected his return. Tho&s;e only who have loved like me can conceive what I felt at this news; but judge into what an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery I was plunged, on receiving a few hours after a letter from his &s;i&s;ter, pre&s;&s;ing me to return to her at Paris, where &s;he was &s;till wait|ing, in compliance with orders from home, for her brother, who was to accompany her to England directly to marry an heire&s;s for whom he had been long intended by his fa|ther; &s;he added that I mu&s;t not lo&s;e a mo|ment, for that her brother would, before I could receive the letter, be on the road to Paris.</P>
<P>Rage, love, pride, re&s;entment, indigna|tion, now tore my bo&s;om alternately. Af|ter a conflict of different pa&s;&s;ions, I determin|ed
<PB N="87" REF="89">
on forgetting my unworthy lover, who&s;e neglect appeared to me the contemptible in|&s;olence of &s;uperior fortune: I left the place the next day, as if for Paris, but taking the neare&s;t way to England, came hither to a clergyman's widow, who had been a friend of my mother's, to whom I told my &s;tory, and with whom I determined to &s;tay concealed, till I heard the fate of my lover. I made a &s;olemn vow, in the fir&s;t heat of my re&s;entment, never to write to him, or let him know my retreat, and, though with in|finite difficulty, I have hitherto kept it. But what have I not &s;uffered for this con|duct, which, though my rea&s;on dictates, my heart condemns! A thou&s;and times have I been on the point of di&s;covering my&s;elf to him, and at lea&s;t giving him an opportuni|ty of vindicating him&s;elf. I accu&s;e my&s;elf of inju&s;tice in condemning him unheard, and on appearances which might be fal&s;e. So weak is a heart in love, that though when I cho&s;e my place of retreat, I was ig|norant
<PB N="88" REF="90">
of that circum&s;tance, it was with plea&s;ure, though a plea&s;ure I endeavoured to hide from my&s;elf, that I heard it was only ten miles from his father's &s;eat. I ought cer|tainly to have changed it on this know|ledge, but find a thou&s;and plau&s;ible rea|&s;ons to the contrary, and am but too &s;uc|ce&s;sful in deceiving my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Convinced of the propriety of my con|duct in avoiding him, I am not the more happy. My heart betrays me, and repre|&s;ents him continually to my imagination in the mo&s;t amiable light, as a faithful lover, injured by my &s;u&s;picions, and made wretch|ed by my lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Torn by &s;entiments which vary every moment; the &s;truggles of my &s;oul have impaired my health, and will in time put an end to a life, to the continuance of which, without him, I am perfectly indif|ferent,</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91">
Determined, however, to per&s;i&s;t in a con|duct, which, whatever I &s;uffer from it, is certainly my duty, I cannot, as I hear he is returned, con&s;ent to come to Belmont, where it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould fail meeting a man of his rank, who mu&s;t undoubtedly be of Lord Belmont's acquaintance.</P>
<P>Till he is married, or I am convinced I have injured him, I will not leave this retreat; at lea&s;t I will not appear where I am almo&s;t certain of meeting him whom I ought for ever to avoid.</P>
<P>O Lady Anne! How &s;evere is this trial! How painful the conque&s;t over the &s;weete&s;t affections of the human heart! How mor|tifying to love an object which one has cea&s;ed to e&s;teem! Convinced of his unwor|thine&s;s, my pa&s;&s;ion remains the &s;ame, nor will ever cea&s;e but with life: I at once de|&s;pi&s;e and adore him: yes, my tenderne&s;s is, if po&s;&s;ible, more lively than ever; and
<PB N="90" REF="92">
though he has doomed me to mi&s;ery, I would die to contribute to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>You, Madam, will, I know, pity and for|give the incon&s;i&s;tencies of a heart a&s;hamed of its own weakne&s;&s;es, yet too &s;incere to di&s;|gui&s;e or palliate them. I am no &s;tranger to your noblene&s;s of &s;entiment; in your friend&s;hip and compa&s;&s;ion all my hopes of tranquillity are founded. I will endeavour to conquer this ill-placed prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and render my&s;elf more worthy your e&s;teem. If his marriage with another makes it im|po&s;&s;ible for him to &s;uppo&s;e I throw my&s;elf de&s;ignedly in his way, I will go with you to town in the winter, and try if the hurry of the world can era&s;e his image from my bo&s;om. If he continues unconnected, and no accident clears up to me his conduct, I will continue where I am, and for ever hide my folly in this retreat.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93">
Poor Bell! how I pity her! Heaven certainly means love for our reward in ano|ther world, it &s;o &s;eldom makes it happy in this. But why do we blame heaven? It is our own prejudices, our rage for wealth, our cowardly compliance with the ab&s;urd opinions of others, which robs us of all the real happine&s;s of life.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know who this de&s;pi|cable fellow is: though really it is po&s;&s;ible &s;he may injure him; I mu&s;t know his name, and find out whether or not &s;he is torturing her&s;elf without rea&s;on. If he bears &s;cruti|nizing, our plans may coincide, and my jointure make us all happy; if not, he &s;hall have the mortification of knowing &s;he has an ea&s;y fortune; and of &s;eeing her, what it &s;hall be my bu&s;ine&s;s to make her next winter, one of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable women, and celebrated toa&s;ts, about town.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">
After all, are we not a little in the ma|chine &s;tyle, not to be able to withdraw our love when our e&s;teem is at an end? I &s;up|po&s;e one might find a philo&s;ophical rea&s;on for this in Newton's Laws of Attraction. The heart of a woman does, I imagine, naturally gravitate towards a hand&s;ome, well-dre&s;&s;ed, well-bred fellow, without enquiry into his mental qualities. Nay, as to that, do not let me be partial to you odious men; you have as little ta&s;te for mere internal charms as the lighte&s;t coquette in town. You talk &s;ometimes of the beauties of the mind; but I &s;hould be glad, as &s;omebody has &s;aid very well, to &s;ee one you of in love with a mind of three&s;core.</P>
<P>I am really &s;orry for Bell, but hope to bring her out of the&s;e heroics by Chri&s;tmas. The town air, and being followed five or &s;ix weeks as a beauty, will do wonders. I know no &s;pecific for a love-fit like a con|&s;tant crowd of pretty fellows.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95">
The world, I dare &s;ay, will &s;oon re&s;tore her to her &s;en&s;es; it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould ever regain them in a lonely vil|lage, with no company but an old wo|man.</P>
<P>How dearly we love to nur&s;e up our fol|lies! Bell, I dare &s;ay, fancies va&s;t merit in this romantic con&s;tancy to a man who, if he knew her ab&s;urdity, would laugh at it.</P>

<P>All this is very &s;trange to me. Lord Bel|mont, to whom I la&s;t night mentioned Lord Melvin's connexion with Bell as a rea&s;on again&s;t his marrying Lady Julia, a&s;&s;ures me no &s;uch thing was ever intended; that he was amazed how I came to think &s;o; that Lord Rochdale has other views for his &s;on, to which, however, he is aver&s;e. I am glad to hear this la&s;t circum&s;tance, and hope Bell has wronged him by her &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>But who can this be that is intended for Lady Julia? I do not love to be imperti|nent, but my curio&s;ity is rather excited; I &s;hall not &s;leep till I am in this &s;ecret; I mu&s;t follow my Lord about till I get a clue to direct me.

<SALUTE>My dear Col.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY a clau&s;e in the patent, which has been hitherto kept &s;ecret in our part of the family, it is provided that on default of heirs male in the younger branch, the title of Earl of Belmont &s;hould go to the elder: in favor al&s;o of this di&s;po&s;ition, the greate&s;t part of the e&s;tate then in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is about half what I now enjoy, is, by a deed, in which, however, my lawyer tells me there is a flaw, which
<PB N="115" REF="117">
makes it of no effect, annexed to the title for ever. Julia being the only child we ever had, it is very probable the e&s;tate and title will be yours: Heaven having ble&s;t you with a &s;on, it would be infinitely agreeable to me, and would keep up the &s;plendor of our name, to agree on an inter|marriage between our children. I would have you educate your &s;on with this view, and at an expence becoming the heir of the titles and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of our family: but as it is po&s;&s;ible I may yet have a &s;on, in that ca&s;e, Lady Mary our relation, who&s;e heart is greatly &s;et on this marriage, will &s;ettle her e&s;tate on yours, and I will give him my daughter, with twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t on being at the whole expence of his education as my heir; as the e&s;tate will probably be his own, it is only anticipating his rents a few years, and does not lay him under the &s;hadow of an obligation.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
I have mentioned above, that there is a defect in the deed, which puts it in my power to rob you of your right in the e&s;tate: but, as the de&s;ign of our ance&s;tor is clear, I take no merit to my&s;elf from not being the mo&s;t infamous of mankind, which I &s;hould be, were I capable of making u&s;e of &s;uch a circum&s;tance to your di&s;advan|tage.</P>
<P>But, could I reconcile &s;o ba&s;e an action to my&s;elf in a private light, no con&s;ideration could make it ea&s;y to me in a public one: I know nothing &s;o dangerous to our happy con&s;titution as an indigent nobility, chained down to a nece&s;&s;ity of court dependence, or tempted, by making faction the tool of am|bition, to di&s;turb the internal peace of their country. Men who are at ea&s;e in their for|tunes are generally good &s;ubjects; the pre|&s;ervation of what they have is a powerful tie of obedience: it is the needy, the di&s;&s;olute, the Cae&s;ars, the Catilines of the world,
<PB N="117" REF="119">
who rai&s;e the &s;torms which &s;hake the foun|dation of government.</P>
<P>You will imagine, my dear friend, I only intend this alliance to take place, if their &s;entiments, when of age to judge for them&s;elves, corre&s;pond with our intentions for their happine&s;s: that this may be the ca&s;e, let us educate them with the utmo&s;t care, in every accompli&s;hment of mind and per&s;on, which can make them lovely in the eyes of each other.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM greatly obliged to your Lord&s;hip for a propo&s;al which does my &s;on &s;uch honor; and for a conduct towards us both &s;o noble and worthy your character.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition you mention is what I have &s;ometimes hoped, but knew your Lord&s;hip's honor and integrity too well to think it nece&s;&s;ary to make any enquiry; convinced, if a &s;ettlement was made in my favor, you would in due time make me ac|quainted with it: till &s;ome probability ap|peared of its taking place, it was, perhaps, better concealed than di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The alliance your Lord&s;hip propo&s;es, if it ever takes place, will make me the hap|pie&s;t of mankind: having, however, ob|&s;erved marriages made by parents in the
<PB N="119" REF="121">
childhood of the parties, to be generally di&s;agreeable to the latter, whether from the perver&s;ene&s;s of human nature, or the free &s;pirit of love impatient of the lea&s;t controll, will intreat our de&s;ign may be kept &s;ecret from all the world, and in particular from the young people them&s;elves: all we can do, is to give them &s;uch an education as will be&s;t improve the gifts of nature, and render them objects of that lively and deli|cate affection which alone can make &s;uch a connexion happy. Perhaps it may be be&s;t to &s;eparate them till the time when the heart is mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of tenderne&s;s, le&s;t an habitual intercour&s;e &s;hould weaken that impre&s;&s;ion which we wi&s;h their perfections to make on each other. Both at pre&s;ent promi&s;e to be lovely, and, if we guard again&s;t other attachments, the charm of novelty, added to what nature has done for them, and tho&s;e acquired graces which it is our part to endeavour to give them, can
<PB N="120" REF="122">
&s;carce fail of in&s;piring a mutual pa&s;&s;ion, which ones &s;eeming to de&s;ire it would pro|bably prevent.</P>
<P>If I am &s;o happy as to have your Lord|&s;hip's concurrence in the&s;e &s;entiments, I will remove my &s;on immediately from your neighbourhood, and educate him in town; at a proper time he &s;hall go, with a private tutor of birth and merit, to the univer&s;ity, and from thence make the tour of Europe, whil&s;t Lady Julia is advancing in every charm under the eye of the mo&s;t excellent of mothers.</P>
<P>Men, who act a con&s;picuous part on the &s;tage of life, and who require a certain au|dacity and &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to bring their ta|lents into full light, cannot, in my opinion, have too public an education: but women, who&s;e lovelie&s;t charm is the ro&s;y blu&s;h of native mode&s;ty, who&s;e virtues blo&s;&s;om faire&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="123">
in the vale, &s;hould never leave their hou&s;hold gods, the be&s;t protectors of innocence.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o my reque&s;t, that my &s;on may be educated in a total ignorance of the &s;et|tlement in our favor, both becau&s;e the ef|fect of it may po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;troyed by your Lord&s;hip's having a &s;on, and becau&s;e he will ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;tation, if he ever arrives at it, with double reli&s;h, if bred with more moderate expecta|tions. He will by this means too e&s;cape the pernicious &s;nares of flattery, the &s;ervile court of intere&s;ted inferiors, and all the va|rious mi&s;chiefs which poi&s;on the minds of young men bred up as heirs to great e&s;tates and titles: he will &s;ee the hatefulne&s;s of pride and arrogance in others before he is tempted to be guilty of them him&s;elf; he will learn to e&s;teem virtue without tho&s;e trappings of wealth and greatne&s;s which he will never hope to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: he will &s;ee the world as
<PB N="122" REF="124">
it is by not being of con&s;equence enough to be flattered or deceived.</P>
<P>His education, his company, his ex|pences, &s;hall, however, be &s;uited to the rank he may one day po&s;&s;ibly fill; my ac|quaintance with foreign courts enables me to introduce him every where to tho&s;e of the fir&s;t rank and merit; his equipage and attendance &s;hall be &s;uch as may &s;ecure him general re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's generous offer of bear|ing the expence of his education, de&s;erves my &s;incere&s;t gratitude; but oeconomy will enable me to &s;upport it without the lea&s;t in|convenience to my affairs: half my income, which I will &s;pare to him, with his mother's fortune, which &s;hall all be devoted to this purpo&s;e, will be &s;ufficient to give him an education becoming the heir of your Lord|&s;hip's fortune and honors.</P>

<P>Colonel Mandeville is in town, directing the drawing of the writings; and comes down in a few days to have them executed.</P>
<P>I have had a &s;econd letter from Lord Melvin, as re&s;pectful as the pride of wo|man can de&s;ire: a po&s;t&s;cript from Lord Rochdale having &s;atisfied me in point of de|corum, I allow his &s;on to vi&s;it here when he plea&s;es.

<P><PB N="125" REF="127">
Heavens! Bellville! What a change in all our affairs! The matrimonial &s;tar pre|vails; it would be &s;trange if I &s;hould be betrayed into the party: and yet, Lady Mary has drawn &s;o bewitching a plan of a wedding-day, as might &s;educe a more de|termined coquette: if one could be mar|ried for that day only&mdash;Or if one was &s;ure of plea&s;ing for ever like Lady Belmont&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Dear madam, &s;aid I, if your Lady|&s;hip would lend one your Ce&s;tus.'</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">  "You are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, my dear Lady Anne, the delicacy and purity of a bride will always give you the charms of one."</Q></P>
<P>I believe her Lady&s;hip may be in the right; it is not the &s;tate, but the fooli&s;h conduct of people who enter into it, that makes it unhappy.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">
If you &s;hould come down with Colonel Mandeville, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what may happen.</P>
<P>Ab&s;olutely, Bellville, if I do conde&s;cend, which is yet extremely doubtful, we will live in the &s;tyle of lovers, I hate the dull road of common marriages: no imperti|nent pre&s;uming on the name of hu&s;band; no &s;aucy freedoms; I will continue to be courted, and &s;hall expect as much flattery, and give my&s;elf as many &s;cornful airs, as if I had never honored you with my hand.</P>
<P>I give you warning, I &s;hall make a mo&s;t intolerable wife; but that is your bu&s;ine&s;s, not mine.</P>
<P>This very day &s;e'nnight, which is Lady Julia's birth-day, is intended for her mar|riage; the hou&s;e is to be full of company invited to celebrate the day, without know|ing on what further account; nobody is
<PB N="127" REF="129">
even to &s;u&s;pect them to be lovers; they are to go privately out of Lady Mary's apartment into the chapel, where my Lord chu&s;es the ceremony &s;hould be performed. We are to have a ma&s;querade in a grand open pavillion, on Corinthian pillars, built for this happy occa&s;ion in the garden oppo|&s;ite the hou&s;e; which is to be in view finely illuminated: the intermediate &s;pace is to be adorned with lamps, intermixed with fe&s;toons of flowers in the trees, round which are to be &s;eats for the villagers, who are never forgot on the&s;e days of annual rejoicing.</P>
<P>Lady Mary, who is mi&s;tre&s;s of the ce|remonies, and who in&s;i&s;ts on joining all our hands that day, has engaged you for the ball to Lady Julia, Harry to Bell Ha&s;tings, and Lord Melvin to me: our &s;ituation is to be kept &s;ecret for a week, which is to be filled up with various &s;cenes of fe&s;tivity; after which we are to go to
<PB N="128" REF="130">
town to be pre&s;ented, and from thence on a tour of &s;ix months to Italy. This is her &s;cheme, but it depends on Bell Ha&s;tings and me whether it &s;hall be executed in full: ten thou&s;and to one but our cruelty &s;poils the prettie&s;t my&s;terious plan of a wedding that can be. Ab&s;olutely Lady Mary has a kind of an idea of things&mdash;I cannot con|ceive how &s;he came by it&mdash;Not the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of an old maid in this plan&mdash;Some|thing &s;o fanciful and like a love affair&mdash;It is a thou&s;and pities her Lady&s;hip &s;hould not be be of the party her&s;elf. Do you know never a &s;prightly old courtier of the Queen's time?</P>
<P>My Lord is &s;o plea&s;ed with the thought of &s;eeing us all happy, that he has given orders for building a temple to Love and Friend&s;hip at a little villa which the colonel has given him, and which is almo&s;t cen|trical in re&s;pect to all our hou&s;es; here we
<PB N="129" REF="131">
are to meet once a week, and exclude the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>Harry and Lady Julia are to live at Lady Mary's &s;eat, about ten miles from hence, and I have fixed on a hou&s;e, which is to be &s;old, at about the &s;ame di&s;tance.</P>
<P>And now, Bellville, to be very &s;erious, I &s;hould be the happie&s;t creature in the world in this pro&s;pect, if I was not afraid of my own conduct. I am volatile, light, extravagant, and capricious; qualities ill &s;uited to matri|monial life. I know my faults, but am not able to mend them: I &s;ee the beauty of order in the moral world, yet doat to exce&s;s on irregularity.</P>
<P>Call on Colonel Mandeville, and concert your journey together. Heaven and earth I What have I not &s;aid in that permi&s;&s;ion? With all my affection for you there is a &s;o|lemnity in the idea&mdash;O Bellville! &s;hould I

<P>I Really cannot help feeling prodigiou&s;ly fooli&s;h about this marriage; it is a thou&s;and to one but I retreat yet: prepare your&s;elf for a di&s;appointment, for I am ex|ceedingly on the capricio&s;o.</P>
<P>O Heavens! I forgot to tell you, an old match-making Lady in the neighbourhood, having taken it into her head I have a pa&s;|&s;ion for Harry Mandeville, and de&s;igning to win my heart, by per&s;uading me to what &s;he &s;uppo&s;es I have a mind to, recom|mended

him &s;trongly to me la&s;t night for a hu&s;band. I heard her with the utmo&s;t at|tention; and when &s;he had fini&s;hed her ha|rangue, blu&s;hed, looked down, he&s;itated, and denied the thing with &s;o pretty a con|fu&s;ion, that &s;he is gone away perfectly convinced I am to be Lady Anne Mande|ville, and will tell it as a &s;ecret all round the country. I am not &s;orry for this, as it will take away all &s;u&s;picion of what is really intended, and &s;ecure that &s;ecrecy we wi&s;h on the occa&s;ion. The good old Lady went away infinitely delighted at being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a quality &s;ecret, which in the country gives no little importance; plea&s;ed too with her own penetration in di&s;covering what nobody el&s;e has &s;u&s;pected: I can|not conceive a happier being than &s;he is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received from town the mo&s;t divine &s;tomacher and &s;leeve-knots you ever beheld: <Q REND="inline">"An intere&s;ting event."</Q> Yes,

Surely, you men think nothing of con&s;equence but &s;ieges and battles: now in my &s;entiments, it would be happy for mankind, if all the heroes who make &s;uch havock among&s;t their &s;pecies, merely becau&s;e they have no|thing to do, would amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;orting &s;uits of ribbands for their ladies.</P>
<P>I am in the &s;weete&s;t good humor to-day that can be imagined, &s;o mild and gentle you would be amazed, a little impatient indeed for the evening, which is to bring my charming Harry.</P>
<P>I have been a&s;king my Lord how, with Harry's &s;en&s;ibility, they contrived to

keep him &s;o long free from attachments. In an&s;wer to which he gave me the enclo&s;ed &s;ketch of a letter, from colonel Mandeville to a lady of his acquaintance at Rome, which he &s;aid would give me a general notion of the matter.</P>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will receive this from the hands of that &s;on I have before had the honor of recommending to your e&s;teem.</P>
<P>I have accompanied him my&s;elf hither, where being perfectly &s;atisfied with his beha|vior, and convinced that generous minds are be&s;t won to virtue by implicit confidence, I have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the tutor I intended to have &s;ent with him to Italy, &s;hall return to England
<PB N="135" REF="137">
my&s;elf, and depend for his conduct on his own di&s;cretion, his de&s;ire of obliging me, and that noblene&s;s of &s;entiment which will make him feel the value of my friend&s;hip for him in its utmo&s;t extent.</P>
<P>I have given him letters to the mo&s;t worthy per&s;ons in every court I intend he &s;hould vi&s;it, but as my chief dependence for the advantages of this tour, are on the count and your&s;elf, I have advi&s;ed him to &s;pend mo&s;t of his time at Rome, where, honored by your friend&s;hip, I doubt not of his re|ceiving that la&s;t fini&s;hing, that delicate poli&s;h, which, I flatter my&s;elf, if not deceiv|ed by the fondne&s;s of a parent, is all he wants to make him perfectly amiable.</P>
<P>To you, Madam, and the count I com|mit him; defend him from the &s;nares of vice, and the contagion of affectation.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">
You receive him an unexperienced youth, with lively pa&s;&s;ions, a warm and af|fectionate heart, an enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagination, probity, openne&s;s, genero&s;ity; and all tho&s;e advantages of per&s;on and mind, which a li|beral education can be&s;tow. I expect him from your hands a gentleman, a man of honor and politene&s;s, with the utmo&s;t dig|nity of &s;entiment and character, adorned by that ea&s;y elegance, that refined &s;implicity of manner, tho&s;e unaffected graces of de|portment &s;o difficult to de&s;cribe, but which it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to conver&s;e much with you without acquiring.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the irre&s;i&s;tible power of beau|ty, I think it of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence with what part of the female world he conver&s;es. I have from childhood habituated him to the conver&s;ation of the mo&s;t lovely and po|lite among&s;t the be&s;t part of the &s;ex, to give him an abhorrence to the indelicacy of the wor&s;t. I have endeavoured to impre&s;s on
<PB N="137" REF="139">
his mind, the mo&s;t lively ideas of the na|tive beauty of virtue; and to cultivate in him that elegance of moral ta&s;te, that quick &s;en&s;ibility, which is a nearer way to recti|tude than the dull road of inanimate pre|cept.</P>
<P>Continuing the &s;ame anxious cares, I &s;end him to perfect his education, not in &s;chools or academies, but in the conver&s;a|tion of the mo&s;t charming among&s;t women: the ardent de&s;ire of plea&s;ing you, and be|coming worthy your e&s;teem, in&s;eparable from the happine&s;s of knowing you, will be the keene&s;t &s;pur to his attainments, and I &s;hall &s;ee him return all the fond heart of a parent can wi&s;h, from his ambition of being honored with your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>To you, Madam, I &s;hall make no &s;ecret of my wi&s;h, that he may come back to England unconnected. I have a view for him beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, to
<PB N="138" REF="140">
which, however, I entreat he may be a &s;tranger; the charms of the Lady cannot fail of attaching a heart which has no pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, from which, I conjure you, if po&s;&s;ible, to guard him. I &s;hould even hear with plea&s;ure you permitted him, to a cer|tain degree, to love you, that he might be &s;teeled to all other charms. If he is half as much in love with you as his father, all other beauties will lay &s;nares for him in vain;</P>

<P>It is now a week &s;ince I have heard from Belmont; not a line from Emily Howard, or Lady Anne; the unhappy have few friends; Lord Melvin is the mi|nion of fortune; he has taken my place in their e&s;teem.</P>

<P>Great God! to what a &s;cene have I been witne&s;s! How &s;hall I relate the &s;hocking particulars?</P>
<P>Lady Julia and I were advanced about a quarter of a mile from the hou&s;e, ble&s;&s;ing Providence, and talking of the dear hope of future happy days; &s;he was owning her pa&s;&s;ion with blu&s;hes, and all the tremor of mode&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, when we were interrupt|ed by the cla&s;hing of &s;words behind &s;ome trees near us; we turned our heads, and &s;aw Lord Melvin, di&s;traction in his air, his &s;word bloody, &s;upporting Harry Mande|ville,
<PB N="145" REF="147">
pale, bleeding, motionle&s;s, and to all appearance in the agonies of death. Lady Julia gave a &s;hriek, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s in my arms. My cries brought &s;ome of the &s;ervants, who happened to be near; part of them, with Lord Melvin, con|veyed Harry to the hou&s;e; whil&s;t the re&s;t &s;taid with me to take care of Lady Julia.</P>
<P>Harry was &s;carce out out of &s;ight when &s;he recovered her &s;en&s;es; &s;he looked wild|ly towards the place where &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw him, then &s;tarting from me, rai&s;ing her eyes to Heaven, her hands cla&s;ped together&mdash;Oh, Bellville! never &s;hall I lo&s;e the idea of that image of horror and de&s;pair&mdash;&s;he neither &s;poke nor &s;hed a tear&mdash;there was an eager wildne&s;s in her look, which froze my &s;oul with terror: &s;he advanced ha&s;tily towards the hou&s;e, looking round her every mo|ment, as if expecting again to &s;ee him, till having exhau&s;ted all her &s;trength, &s;he &s;unk down breathle&s;s on one of the &s;eats, where I &s;upported her till my Lord's cha|riot,
<PB N="146" REF="148">
which I had &s;ent for, came up, in which I placed my&s;elf by her, and we drove &s;lowly towards the hou&s;e: &s;he was put to-bed in a burning fever, preceded by a &s;hivering, which gives me apprehen&s;ions for her, which I endeavor to conceal from the wretched parents, who&s;e &s;orrows mock all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>My Lord is ju&s;t come from Lord Mel|vin, who in&s;i&s;ted on being his pri&s;oner, till Harry was out of danger; di&s;daining to fly from ju&s;tice, &s;ince my Lord refu&s;es his &s;tay at Belmont, he intreats to be given into the hands of &s;ome gentleman near. My Lord has accepted this offer, and named his fa|ther Lord Rochdale for the tru&s;t. He is gone under the be&s;t guard, his own honor, in which Lord Belmont has implicit con|fidence.</P>
<P>I have been into Lady Julia's room; &s;he takes no notice of any thing. Emily
<PB N="147" REF="149">
Howard kneels weeping by her bed&s;ide. Lady Belmont melts my &s;oul when I be|hold her; &s;he &s;its motionle&s;s as the &s;tatue of de&s;pair; &s;he holds the hand of her love|ly daughter between hers, &s;he pre&s;&s;es it to her bo&s;om, and the tears &s;teal &s;ilently down her cheeks.</P>
<P>Unable to bear the &s;ight, I am returned to my apartment.</P>
<P>Oh, Bellville! How is this &s;cene of hap|pine&s;s changed? Where are now the gay tran&s;porting hopes which warmed our hearts this morning?</P>
<P>I have with difficulty prevailed on Lady Mary, who droops under this weight of affliction, and who&s;e years are ill &s;uited to &s;cenes of horror, to &s;et out this evening for her own &s;eat; my niece, who&s;e &s;orrow you may ea&s;ily imagine, is to accompany her thither: if Mr. Mandeville dies, mur|dered
<PB N="148" REF="150">
by the hand of him with who&s;e fate hers is connected, never mu&s;t &s;he again en|ter the&s;e ho&s;pitable doors.</P>
<P>Bellville! how is the gay &s;tructure of ideal happine&s;s fallen in one moment to the ground!</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger who was &s;ent to Lord T&mdash;'s is returned, and has brought my Lord's letter; he went from thence to Mr. Herbert's, where Mr. Mandeville was &s;up|po&s;ed to be, but found nobody there but a &s;ervant, from whom he could get no in|formation. The family had been gone five days to London, being &s;ent for expre&s;s to a relation who was dying.</P>
<P>Oh Bellville! how many accidents have con&s;pired&mdash;I my&s;elf have innocently contributed to this dreadful event, mi&s;led by my Lord's equivocal expre&s;&s;ions, which &s;eemed to point &s;o plainly at Lord Mel|vin&mdash;If

<P><PB N="154" REF="156">
He expre&s;&s;ed great indifference for life on his own account, but dreaded the effect his death might have on the mo&s;t tender of fathers: intreated my Lord to &s;often &s;o painful a &s;troke by preparing him for it by degrees, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to conceal from him the &s;hocking manner of it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How ill, &s;aid he, has my ra&s;hne&s;s repaid him for all his anxious cares, his indulgent goodne&s;s!

of giving her to him, and of the whole plan of purpo&s;ed happine&s;s, which his impatience, irritated by a &s;eries of unfore&s;een accidents, had &s;o fatally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Till now he had appeared perfectly com|po&s;ed; but from the moment my Lord be|gan to &s;peak, a wildne&s;s had appeared in his countenance, which ro&s;e before he ended to little le&s;s than di&s;traction; he raved, he reproached Heaven it&s;elf; then melting into tears, prayed with fervor un&s;peakable for Lady Julia's recovery: the agitation of his mind cau&s;ed his wounds to bleed afre&s;h; &s;ucce&s;&s;ive faintings were the con&s;equence, in one of which he expired.</P>

<P>YOUR letter, my dear Bellville, gave me all the con&s;olation it is po&s;&s;ible to receive amid&s;t &s;uch a &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair; the tender &s;ympathy of pi|tying friend&s;hip is the be&s;t balm for every woe.</P>
<P>The delicacy with which you decline mentioning a &s;ubject &s;o improper for the time, would encrea&s;e my e&s;teem for you, if that was po&s;&s;ible. I know the goodne&s;s, the tender &s;en&s;ibility of your heart, too well to doubt your approving my re&s;olu|tion to give &s;ix months to the memory of my angelic friend, and the &s;ad ta&s;k of en|deavoring to &s;often the &s;orrows of her pa|rents. Her dying voice adjured me not
<PB N="175" REF="177">
to leave them to their de&s;pair: I will not forget the &s;ad ta&s;k her friend&s;hip impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The agony of Lady Belmont's grief begins to give place to a &s;orrow more rea&s;onable, though, perhaps, not le&s;s ex|qui&s;ite. The violence of her emotions abate; &s;he &s;tills weeps, but her air is more calm; &s;he rai&s;es her eyes to Heaven, but it is with a look of patient re&s;ignation, which, whil&s;t it melts my &s;oul to behold, gives me hopes &s;he will not &s;ink under her afflictions; Lord Belmont &s;truggles with his own grief, le&s;t is &s;hould encrea&s;e hers; he attempts to comfort her; he begs her, with an irre&s;olute air, to con&s;ider the hand from whence the &s;troke proceeded; unable to go on, his voice trembles; his bo&s;om &s;wells with unutterable angui&s;h; he ri&s;es; he leaves the room; the tears trickle down his reverend cheeks.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178">
The&s;e, Bellville, the&s;e are the &s;cenes I have perpetually before my eyes.</P>
<P>Colonel Mandeville indulges his &s;orrow alone; &s;hut up continually in his apartment, a prey to &s;ilent di&s;tre&s;s, he &s;eems to fly from all human conver&s;e: if entreated, he joins our &s;ad party a moment, he enters with a dejected air, his eyes are bent ear|ne&s;tly to the ground; he &s;its motionle&s;s, inattentive, ab&s;orbed in reflexion on his own mi&s;ery; then &s;tarting up exclaims, <Q REND="inline">"All el&s;e I could have borne,"</Q> and retires to give him&s;elf up to his de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I am now convinced Emily Howard de|&s;erved that preference Lady Julia gave her over me in her heart, of which I once &s;o un|ju&s;tly complained; I lament, I regret, but am enough my&s;elf to rea&s;on, to reflect; Emily Howard can only weep.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">
Far from being con&s;oled for the lo&s;s of her lovely friend, by the pro&s;pect of in|heriting Lord Belmont's fortune, to which after Colonel Mandeville &s;he is intitled, &s;he &s;eems incapable of ta&s;ting any good in life without her; every idea of happine&s;s her gentle mind could form included Lady Julia's friend&s;hip; with her &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;pend all her days; &s;he was all to her ten|der Emily; without her &s;he finds the world a de&s;art.</P>
<P>She is changed beyond conception by her grief, a grief which has not a moment's in|termi&s;&s;ion: the almo&s;t dying palene&s;s of her cheeks is a witne&s;s of the exce&s;s of her affliction; yet this very palene&s;s has a thou|&s;and charms; her di&s;tre&s;s has &s;omething in it un&s;peakably lovely; adorned by &s;or|row, &s;he puts me in mind of what Young de&s;cribes woman in general;

<P>Bellville, I have been walking in a little wilderne&s;s of flowering &s;hrubs once pecu|liarly happy in Lady Julia's favor; there is a ro&s;e which I &s;aw planted by her hand; it &s;till flouri&s;hes in youthful bloom, whil&s;t &s;he, the faire&s;t flower Heaven ever formed, lies cropped by the cruel hand of Death.</P>
<P>What force has the imagination over the &s;en&s;es! How different is the whole face of nature in my eyes! The once &s;miling &s;cene has a melancholy gloom, which &s;trikes a damp through my inmo&s;t &s;oul: I look in vain for tho&s;e vivid beauties which once charmed me; all beauty died with Lady Julia.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">
In this &s;pot, where we have &s;o often walked together, I give way to all the vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s of &s;orrow; I recall tho&s;e happy days which are never to return; a thou&s;and tender ideas ru&s;h on my memory; I recol|lect tho&s;e dear moments of confidence and friend&s;hip engraved for ever on my heart; I &s;till hear the &s;weet accents of that voice, &s;till behold that matchle&s;s form; I &s;ee her every moment before me, in all the play|fulne&s;s of youth and innocence; I &s;ee her parents gazing on her as &s;he pa&s;&s;es, with that lively tran&s;port a parent only can know.</P>
<P>It was here her ri&s;ing blu&s;hes fir&s;t di&s;co|vered to me the &s;ecret of her heart: it was here the lovelie&s;t of mankind fir&s;t implored me to favor his pa&s;&s;ion for my &s;weet friend.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with the tender &s;orrow which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all my &s;oul, I determined to in|dulge it to the utmo&s;t; and revolving in my imagination the happy hours of chear|ful

<P>Awaking at once from the reverie in which I had been plunged, I found my&s;elf at a di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, ju&s;t entering the little wood &s;o loved by my charming friend; the every moment encrea&s;ing dark|ne&s;s gave an awful gloom to the trees; I &s;topped, I looked round, not a human form was in &s;ight; I li&s;tened and heard not a &s;ound but the trembling of &s;ome pop|lars in the wood; I called, but the echo of my own voice was the only an&s;wer I re|ceived; a dreary &s;ilence reigned around, a terror I never felt before &s;eized me, my heart panted with timid apprehen&s;ion; I breathed &s;hort, I &s;tarted at every leaf that moved; my limbs were covered with a

<P>At the moment when my fears had al|mo&s;t deprived me of &s;en&s;e, I &s;aw Colonel Mandeville approach; I concealed from him the terrors of my &s;oul, le&s;t they &s;hould add to the &s;orrow which con&s;umed him: he addre&s;&s;ed me in a faltering voice, con|ducted me to the hou&s;e almo&s;t without &s;peaking, and leading me into the &s;aloon&mdash;Oh Bellville!

<P>Is not Death of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently dread|ful, that we thus clothe it in additional terrors, by the horrid apparatus with which we &s;uffer it to be attended? The room was hung with black, lighted up to &s;how the affecting objects it contained, and in the mid&s;t, in their coffins, the breathle&s;s bodies

<P>I approached Lady Julia's coffin, I gazed eagerly on her angel countenance, &s;erene as that of a &s;leeping infant; I ki&s;&s;ed her lifele&s;s lips, which &s;till wore the &s;mile of innocence and peace. Bellville, may my la&s;t end be like hers! May I meet her in the regions of immortality! Never &s;hall I forget her gentle virtues, or the delight I found in her friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185">
She was wrapped in a loo&s;e robe of white &s;attin: her head covered with a veil of gau&s;e: the village maids, who laid her in the coffin, had adorned herwith the fre&s;he&s;t flow|ers; they &s;tood at an awful di&s;tance, weep|ing her hard fate and their own: they have entreated to watch around her this night, and to bear her to-morrow to the grave.</P>
<P>I had &s;tood &s;ome time looking on the dear remains of Lady Julia, when Colonel Mandeville took my hand, and leading me to the coffin in which his &s;on's were depo|&s;ited; <Q REND="inline">"Lady Anne, &s;aid he, you have for|got your once favored friend, your once gay, once lovely Harry Mandeville. Be|hold all that Death has left of the darling of a fond parent's heart!

I approached the mo&s;t lovely of men; the traces of &s;orrow were vi&s;ible on his counten|ance; he died in the moment when he heard the happine&s;s which had been vainly in|tended for him. My tears &s;treamed afre&s;h when I beheld him, when I remembered the &s;weet hours we had pa&s;&s;ed together, the gay &s;cenes which hope had painted to our hearts; I wept over the friend I had &s;o loved, I pre&s;&s;ed his cold hand to my lips.</P>
<P>Bellville! I am now accu&s;tomed to horrors.</P>
<P>We have prevailed on the wretched parents to retire: Emily Howard and I, have entreated to watch our angel friends till midnight, and then leave them to the village maids, to whom Lady Julia's weeping attendants in&s;i&s;t on being joined.</P>

<P>At dawn of day we returned to the &s;a|loon, we bid a la&s;t adieu to the loved remains; my Lord and Colonel Mande|ville had been before us: they were going to clo&s;e the coffins, when Lady Belmont bur&s;t wildly into the room; &s;he called ea|gerly for her Julia, for the idol of her ago|nizing &s;oul: <Q REND="inline">"Let me once more behold my child, let me once more ki&s;s tho&s;e icy lips: O Julia! this day fir&s;t gave thee birth, this day fond hope &s;et down for thy brid|als, this day we re&s;ign thee to the grave!"</Q></P>

<P>I Am ju&s;t come from chapel with Lady Belmont, who has been pouring out the &s;orrows of her &s;oul to her Creator, with a fervor of devotion which a mind like hers alone can feel: when &s;he approached the &s;eat once filled by Lady Julia, the tears &s;treamed involuntarily down her cheeks; &s;he wiped them away, &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes to Heaven, and falling on her knees, with a look of pious re&s;ignation, &s;eemed to &s;acrifice her grief to her god, or at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pend the expre&s;&s;ion of it in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Next Sunday &s;he goes to the pari&s;h church, where the angelic pair are interred; I dread her &s;eeing the vault, yet think &s;he cannot too &s;oon vi&s;it every place which mu&s;t renew the exce&s;s of her affliction; &s;he
<PB N="189" REF="191">
will then, and not till then, find, by degrees, the violence of her &s;orrow &s;ub&s;ide, and give way to that plea&s;ing melancholy, that ten|der regret, which, however &s;trange it may appear, is one of the mo&s;t charming &s;en|&s;ations of the human heart.</P>
<P>Whether it be that the mind abhors no|thing like a &s;tate of inaction, or from what|ever cau&s;e I know not, but grief it&s;elf is more agreeable to us than indifference; nay, if not too exqui&s;ite, is in the highe&s;t degree delightful; of which the plea&s;ure we take in tragedy, or in talking of our dead friends, is a &s;triking proof; we wi&s;h not to be cured of what we feel on the&s;e occa&s;ions; the tears we &s;hed are charming, we even indulge in them; Bellville, does not the very word <HI>indulge</HI> &s;hew the &s;en&s;ation to be plea&s;ureable?</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now a letter from my niece; &s;he is in de&s;pair at this dreadful event; &s;he &s;ees the amiable, the venerable parents, who&s;e happine&s;s was the ardent wi&s;h of her

&s;oul, and from whom &s;he had received every proof of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip, re|duced to the extreme&s;t mi&s;ery, by the hand of him &s;he loves: for ever excluded from Belmont, for ever to them an object of hor|ror, &s;he &s;eems to her&s;elf guilty of their wretchedne&s;s, &s;he &s;eems to have &s;truck the fatal blow.</P>
<P>Since Mr. Mandeville's death &s;he has left Lady Mary, who&s;e tears &s;he fancied were redoubled at her &s;ight.</P>
<P>Nor is &s;he le&s;s wretched on Lord Mel|vin's account, &s;he is di&s;tracted with her terrors for his life, which is however &s;afe by Mr. Mandeville's generous care, who when expiring gave te&s;timony to his innocence.</P>
<P>You will oblige me by begging of Lady Betty to take her at pre&s;ent under her pro|tection: it ill &s;uits the delicacy of her &s;ex and birth to remain in London alone
<PB N="191" REF="193">
and unconnected: with your amiable mo|ther, &s;he cannot fail of being happy.</P>
<P>I had per&s;waded Lady Belmont to walk in the garden, &s;he went with me, leaning on my arm, when the door being opened the fir&s;t object that &s;truck her &s;ight was the pavillion rai&s;ed for the marriage of her daughter, which none of us had thought of having removed.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted, &s;he returned ha&s;tily to her apartment, and throwing her&s;elf on a couch, gave a loo&s;e to all the angui&s;h of her &s;oul.</P>
<P>Bellville, every object &s;he meets will re|mind her of the darling of her heart.</P>
<P>My Lord and Colonel Mandeville are together, they are projecting a tomb for their lovely children: a tomb worthy the ardour of their own parental affection; wor|thy to perpetuate the memory of their vir|tues,

<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed this moment through the &s;aloon, I went mechanically to the window from whence we u&s;ed to contemplate the happy groups of villagers.

<P>Lord Fondville is gone pa&s;t with his bride, in all the &s;plendor of exulting tran&s;|port. Scarce can I forbear accu&s;ing Heaven; the worthle&s;s live and pro&s;per, the virtuous &s;ink untimely to the grave.</P>

My Lord has ordered the pavillion to be removed; he will build an obeli&s;k on the &s;pot where it &s;tood, on the &s;pot once dedi|cated to the happine&s;s of his child.</P>

<P>IF my regret for the latedreadful event, an event embittered by the circum&s;tances your la&s;t letter communicated to me, could receive any encrea&s;e, it certainly mu&s;t from the generous behaviour of Mr. Mande|ville, who&s;e care for my unhappy &s;on, when expiring, is a proof his blood was drawn from the &s;ame &s;ource as your Lord&s;hip's. Yes, he was indeed worthy the happine&s;s you intended him, worthy the honored name of Mandeville.</P>
<P>Relieved by the noble conduct of your lamented kin&s;man, from the fears I enter|tained for my &s;on's life, my &s;orrows for the
<PB N="195" REF="197">
mi&s;eries he has occa&s;ioned, is only the more &s;evere: I feel with unutterable angui&s;h that my ancient friend, the friend of my earlie&s;t youth, is childle&s;s by the crime of him who owes his being to me: the blow his hand unwillingly &s;truck, has reached the heart of the incomparable Lady Julia; I think of her angelic perfections, of the untimely fate which has robbed the world of its lovelie&s;t ornament, and almo&s;t wi&s;h never to have been a father.</P>
<P>Lady Rochdale and Loui&s;a are in tears by me; for ever excluded from Belmont, they look on them&s;elves as exiles, though at home. The horrors of mind under which my &s;on labors are unutterable; he entreats to &s;ee Colonel Mandeville; to ob|tain his pardon for that involuntary crime, which has de&s;troyed all the happine&s;s of his life.</P>

<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COnvinced Lord Melvin is more un|fortunate than culpable, it would be cruel to treat him as a criminal: I feel a horror I cannot conquer at the idea of ever receiving the vi&s;it your Lord&s;hip has pro|po&s;ed; but con&s;cious of the inju&s;tice of in|dulging it, I &s;acrifice it to our antient friend|&s;hip, and only po&s;tpone, not refu&s;e, the vi&s;it: I will &s;truggle with the reluctance of my heart, to &s;ee the guiltle&s;s author of my mi&s;ery, as &s;oon as he is publicly exculpated from the crime he at pre&s;ent &s;tands charged with: Colonel Mandeville mu&s;t appear as his accu&s;er: wretched as his hand has made me, ju&s;tice obliges me to bear witne&s;s to his innocence: Lady Anne Wilmot, who
<PB N="198" REF="200">
was pre&s;ent at Mr. Mandeville's dying de|claration, is ready to confirm my evidence: Lord Melvin therefore has nothing to fear. The trial once pa&s;t, I will endeavor to pre|vail on Colonel Mandeville and Lady Bel|mont, to make the &s;ame painful &s;acrifice to friend&s;hip, to which time and rea&s;on will I hope perfectly reconcile us; but your Lord|&s;hip will, on a moment's reflexion, be con|vinced that, till this is pa&s;t, it would be in|decent in me to &s;ee Lord Melvin.</P>
<P>We are greatly obliged to Lady Roch|dale and Lady Loui&s;a; the time of who&s;e vi&s;it their own politene&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility will regulate; it is a &s;evere addition to my wretchedne&s;s, that the family of my friend is &s;o fatally involved in it.</P>
<P>Oh, Lord Rochdale! you are a father, and can pity us: you can judge the an|gui&s;h to which we mu&s;t ever be a prey; never more &s;hall we know a chearful hour;
<PB N="199" REF="201">
our lo&s;t child will be ever at our hearts: when I remember her filial &s;weetne&s;s, her angel virtues, her matchle&s;s perfections&mdash;the only view we had in life was to &s;ee her happy: that is pa&s;t, and all is now a dreary wild before us; time may blunt the keen edge of &s;orrow, and enable us to bear the load of life with patience; but never mu&s;t we hope the return of peace.</P>
<P>The &s;hortne&s;s of life, and the con&s;idera|tion how much of our own is pa&s;t, are the only con&s;olations we can receive: it cannot be long before we rejoin our beloved child: we have only to pray for that ardently ex|pected hour which will re-unite us to all we love.</P>
<P>Why will man lay &s;chemes of la&s;ting felicity? By an over &s;olicitude to continue my family and name, and &s;ecure the hap|pine&s;s of my child, I have defeated my own purpo&s;e, and fatally de&s;troyed both.</P>

Humbled in the du&s;t, I confe&s;s the hand of Heaven: the pride of birth, the gran|deur of my hou&s;e, had too great a &s;hare in my re&s;olves!</P>

<P>I AM de&s;ired by my Lord to a&s;k you hither, and to beg you will bring my niece with you. Lady Belmont joins in the reque&s;t; her noblene&s;s of &s;entiment has conquered the reluctance &s;he had to &s;ee her; &s;he has even promi&s;ed to endeavor to bear the &s;ight of Lord Melvin, but I fear this is more than is in her power; &s;he fainted when the reque&s;t was fir&s;t made. Lady Mary is expected here this evening.</P>
<P>Bellville, you are coming to Belmont, once the &s;miling paradice of friend&s;hip, Alas! how changed from that once happy abode! Where are tho&s;e blamele&s;s plea&s;ures, that con|vivialjoy, tho&s;e &s;weet follies, which once gave &s;uch charms to this place? For ever gone,
<PB N="202" REF="204">
for ever changed to a gloomy &s;adne&s;s, for ever buried with Lady Julia.</P>
<P>Lady Belmont &s;truggles nobly with her grief; &s;he has con&s;ented to &s;ee her friends, to &s;ee all who will hear her talk of her child: a tender melancholy has taken place of tho&s;e horrors, which it was impo&s;|&s;ible long to &s;upport and live.</P>
<P>Colonel Mandeville is to &s;tay at Belmont, they are to indulge in all the voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s of &s;orrow; they are to &s;it all day and talk of their matchle&s;s children, and count the hours till they follow them to the grave. They have invited all who will join in tears with them; the coach is gone to-day for Mr. and Mrs. Herbert.</P>
<P>Emily Howard and I bend our whole thoughts to find out means to &s;often their &s;orrows; I hope much from your conver|&s;ation, and the endearing &s;en&s;ibility of your &s;oul; it is not by re&s;i&s;ting, but by &s;ooth|ing
<PB N="203" REF="205">
grief, that we mu&s;t heal the wounded heart.</P>
<P>There is one plea&s;ure to which they can never be in&s;en&s;ible, the plea&s;ure of reliev|ing the mi&s;eries of others: to divert their attention from the &s;ad objects which now engro&s;s them, we mu&s;t find out the re|treats of wretchedne&s;s; we mu&s;t point out di&s;tre&s;s which it is in their power to alleviate.</P>
<P>Oh, Bellville! But in vain does the pride of human wi&s;dom &s;eek to explore the coun&s;els of the Mo&s;t High! Certain of the paternal care of our Creator, our part is &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will.</P>
