<P>A JOURNEY MADE IN THE SUMMER OF 1794, THROUGH HOLLAND AND THE WESTERN FRONTIER OF GERMANY, WITH A RETURN DOWN THE RHINE: TO WHICH ARE ADDED OBSERVATIONS DURING A TOUR TO THE LAKES OF LANCASHIRE, WESTMORELAND, AND CUMBERLAND.</P>

<P>THE Author begs leave to ob&s;erve, in explanation of the u&s;e made of the plural term in the following pages, that, her journey having been performed in the company of her neare&s;t relative and friend, the account of it has been written &s;o much from their mu|tual ob&s;ervation, that there would be a deception in permitting the book to appear, without &s;ome acknowledgment, which may di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from works entirely her own. The title page would, there|fore, have contained the joint names of her hu&s;band and her&s;elf, if this mode of appearing before the Public, be&s;ides being thought by that relative a greater acknowledgement than was due to his &s;hare of the work, had not &s;eemed liable to the imputation of a de&s;ign to attract attention by extraordinary novelty. It is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to her own &s;atisfaction, that &s;ome notice &s;hould be taken of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She may therefore, be permitted to intrude a few more words, as to this &s;ubject, by &s;aying, that where the oeconomical and political conditions of countries are touched upon in the following work, the remarks are le&s;s her own than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the book it&s;elf, it is, of cour&s;e, impo&s;&s;ible, and would be degrading if it were not &s;o, to prevent ju&s;t cen&s;ure by apologies; and unju&s;t cen&s;ure &s;he has no rea&s;on, from her experi|ence, to fear;&mdash;but &s;he will venture to defend a practice adopted in the following pages, that has been &s;ometimes blamed for its apparent
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
nationality, by writers of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authority. The re|ferences to England, which frequently occur during the foreign part of the tour, are made becau&s;e it has &s;eemed that one of the be&s;t modes of de&s;cribing to any cla&s;s of readers what they may not know, is by comparing it with what they do.</P>

<HEAD>HELVOETSLUYS.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT twenty hours after our embarkation, at Har|wich, and &s;ix after our fir&s;t &s;ight of the low-&s;pread and barren coa&s;t of <HI>Gorce,</HI> we reached this place, which is &s;eated on one of many inlets, that carry the waters of the German Ocean through the &s;outhern part of the province of Holland. <HI>Goree,</HI> rendered an i&s;land by the&s;e encroachments of the &s;ea, is always the fir&s;t land expected by the &s;eamen; or rather they look out for the lofty tower of its church, which, though &s;everal miles more di&s;tant than the &s;hore, is vi&s;ible when that cannot be di&s;cerned. The entrance of the water between the land, in a channel probably three leagues wide, &s;oon after commences; and Helvoet&s;luys is then pre&s;ently &s;een, with the ma&s;ts of ve&s;&s;els ri&s;ing above its low hou&s;es, amid&s;t green embankments and pa&s;tures, that there begin to reward the care of excluding the &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10">
The names of Dutch towns are in them&s;elves expre&s;&s;ive of the ob|jects mo&s;t intere&s;ting to a people, who, for opportunities of commerce, have increa&s;ed their original and natural dangers, by admitting the water in &s;ome parts, while, for their homes and their lives, they mu&s;t prevent it from encroaching upon others. <HI>Dam, Sluice,</HI> or <HI>Dyke</HI> occur in almo&s;t all their compounded titles. The &s;luice, which gives this town part of its name, is al&s;o its harbour; affording, per|haps, an outlet to the overflowings of the country behind, but filled at the entrance to the depth of more than eighty feet by the &s;ea, with which it communicates.</P>
<P>Upon the banks of this &s;luice, which are partly artificial, the town is built in one &s;hort &s;treet of &s;mall hou&s;es, inhabited chiefly by trade&s;men and innkeepers. The dockyard bounds the &s;luice and the town, communicating with the former by gates, over which a &s;mall pivot bridge connects the two &s;ides of the &s;treet. Each head of the pier, or harbour, has been extended beyond the land for &s;everal yards, by pile work, filled with earth and large &s;tones, over which there is no pavement, that its condition may be con&s;tantly known. We &s;tepped from the packet upon one of the&s;e, and, walking along the beams, that pa&s;s between the immen&s;e piles, &s;aw how clo&s;ely the <HI>inter&s;tices</HI> were filled, and how the earth and &s;tones were again compacted by a &s;trong kind of ba&s;ket-work.</P>
<P>The arrival of a packet is the chief incident known at Helvoet|&s;luys;
<PB N="3" REF="11">
and, as ours entered the harbour about noon, and in fine wea|ther, perhaps, a fourth part of the inhabitants were collected as &s;pec|tators. Their appearance did not &s;urpri&s;e us with all the novelty, which we had expected from the fir&s;t &s;ight of a foreign people. The Dutch &s;eamen every where retain the national dre&s;s; but the other men of Helvoet&s;luys differ from Engli&s;hmen in their appearance chiefly by wearing coar&s;er clothes, and by bringing their pipes with them into the &s;treet. Further on, &s;everal women were collected about their ba&s;kets of herbs, and their dre&s;s had &s;ome of the novelty, for which we were looking; they had hats of the &s;ize of a &s;mall chine&s;e umbrella, and almo&s;t as gaudily lined within; clo&s;e, white jackets, with long flaps; &s;hort, coloured petticoats, in the &s;hape of a diving|bell; yellow &s;lippers, without quarters at the heel; and caps, that exactly fitted the head and concealed the hair, but which were orna|mented at the temples by gold filiagree cla&s;ps, twirling, like vine ten|drils, over the cheeks of the wearer.</P>
<P>Our inn was kept by Engli&s;h people, but the furniture was en|tirely Dutch. Two beds, like cribs in a &s;hip, were let into the wain&s;cot; and we were told, that, in all the inns on our journey, we &s;hould &s;eldom, or never, be &s;hewn into a room, which had not a bed.</P>
<P>Helvoet&s;luys, it &s;ufficiently appears, is a very incon&s;iderable place, as to its &s;ize and inhabitants. But it is not &s;o in naval, or military e&s;timation. It is di&s;tant about ten or twelve miles from the open &s;ea, yet is nearly &s;ecure from attack on this &s;ide, becau&s;e that part of the approach, which is deep enough for large ve&s;&s;els, is commanded
<PB N="4" REF="12">
by batteries on &s;hore. It &s;tands in the middle of an immen&s;e bay, large enough to contain all the navy of Holland, and has a dockyard and ar&s;enal in the centre of the fortifications. When we pa&s;&s;ed through it, &s;ix &s;hips of the line and two frigates were lying in the dockyard, and two &s;hips of the line and three frigates, under the command of an Admiral, in the bay.</P>
<P>The fortifications, we were a&s;&s;ured upon good military authority, were in &s;uch repair, that not a &s;od was out of its place, and are &s;trong enough to be defended by five thou&s;and men again&s;t an hun|dred thou&s;and, for five weeks. The &s;ea water ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable height in a wide ditch, which &s;urrounds them. We omitted to copy an in&s;cription, placed on one of the walls, which told the date of their completion; but this was probably about the year 1696, when the harbour was perfected. Though the dockyard can be only one of the dependencies upon that of Rotterdam, the large&s;t &s;hips of that juri&s;diction are pre&s;erved here, on account of the convenient commu|nication between the port and the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Near this place may be ob&s;erved, what we examined with more lei&s;ure upon our return, the ingenuity, utility and va&s;tne&s;s of the em|bankments, oppo&s;ed by the Dutch to the &s;ea. From Helvoet&s;luys ea&s;tward, for many miles, the land is pre&s;erved from the &s;ea only by an artificial mound of earth, again&s;t which the water heavily and often impetuou&s;ly &s;trives for admi&s;&s;ion into the &s;heltered plains below. The &s;ea, at high water, is &s;o much above the level of the ground, from which it is thus boldly &s;eparated, that one who
<PB N="5" REF="13">
&s;tands on the land &s;ide of the embankment hears the water foaming, as if over his head. Yet the mound it&s;elf, which has &s;tood for two centuries, at lea&s;t, without repair, though with many renewals of the means, that protect it, is &s;till unhurt and undimini&s;hed, and may yet &s;ee generations of tho&s;e, whom it defends, ri&s;ing and pa&s;&s;ing away, on one &s;ide, like the fluctuations of the tides, which a&s;&s;ail and retire from it, on the other.</P>
<P>It is better, however, to de&s;cribe than to prai&s;e. The mound, which appears to be throughout of the &s;ame height, as to the &s;ea, is &s;ometimes more and &s;ometimes le&s;s rai&s;ed above the fields; for, where the natural level of the land a&s;&s;i&s;ts in re&s;i&s;tance to the water, the Hollanders have, of cour&s;e, availed them&s;elves of it, to exert the le&s;s of their art and their labour. It is, perhaps, for the mo&s;t part, thirty feet above the adjoining land. The width at top is enough to permit the pa&s;&s;age of two carriages, and there is a &s;ort of imperfect road along it. In its de&s;cent, the breadth increa&s;es &s;o much, that it is not very difficult to walk down either &s;ide. We could not mea|&s;ure it, and may therefore be excu&s;ed for relating how its &s;ize may be gue&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the land &s;ide, it is &s;aid to be &s;trengthened by &s;tone and timber, which we did not &s;ee, but which may be there, covered by earth and gra&s;s. Towards the &s;ea, &s;omewhat above and con&s;iderably below high-water mark, a &s;trong matting of flags prevents the &s;urge from carrying away the &s;urface of the mound; and this is the defence which has &s;o long pre&s;erved it. The matting is held to the &s;hore by
<PB N="6" REF="14">
bandages of twi&s;ted flags, running horizontally, at the di&s;tance of three or four yards from each other, and &s;taked to the ground by &s;trong wooden pins. As this matting is worn by every tide, a &s;ur|vey of it is frequently made, and many parts appear to have been ju&s;t repaired. Further in the &s;ea, it is held down by &s;tones; above, there are po&s;ts at every forty yards, which are numbered, that the &s;pot may be exactly de&s;cribed where repairs are nece&s;&s;ary. The impo&s;t for the maintenance of the&s;e banks amounts to nearly as much as the land-tax; and, as the land could not be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without it, this tax has the valuable character of being occa&s;ioned by no mi&s;manage|ment, and of producing no di&s;content.</P>

<HEAD>ROTTERDAM.</HEAD>
<P>FROM Helvoet&s;luys to this place the u&s;ual way is by the Brill and Mae&s;land &s;luice, with &s;everal changes of carriages and boats; but, on the days of the arrival of mails, a Rotterdam &s;kipper, who&s;e ve&s;&s;el has been left at a hamlet on the Mae&s;e, takes his party in car|riages acro&s;s the i&s;land of Voorn, on which Helvoet&s;luys &s;tands, to his &s;chuyt, and from thence by the Mae&s;e to Rotterdam. We paid two ducats, or about &s;eventeen &s;hillings, for the whole, and found this the highe&s;t price given for travelling in Holland. Our carriage
<PB N="7" REF="15">
was a &s;ort of &s;mall coach of the fa&s;hion, exhibited in paintings of the &s;ixteenth century, but open before, and &s;o ill-furni&s;hed with &s;prings, that the Dutch name, <Q REND="inline">"a covered waggon,"</Q> was not an improper de|&s;cription of it. A bad road led us through &s;ome meadows of meagre gra&s;s, and through fields in which corn was higher, though thinner, than in England. The pro&s;pect was over an entire level to the ho|rizon, except that the &s;pires of di&s;tant villages, &s;ome &s;mall clu&s;ters of trees, and now and then a wind-mill, varied it. As we approached any of the&s;e clu&s;ters, we found u&s;ually a neat farm-hou&s;e &s;heltered within, and included, together with its garden and orchard, in a per|fect green fence: the fields were el&s;ewhere &s;eparated from each other and from the road, neither by hedges or walls, but by deep ditches filled with water, over which are laid &s;mall bridges, that may be opened in the middle by a &s;ort of trap-door, rai&s;ed and locked to a po&s;t, to prevent the intru&s;ion of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>On the way we pa&s;&s;ed now and then a waggon filled with large bra&s;s jugs, bright as new gold. In the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which have &s;hort narrow necks, covered with a wooden &s;topper, milk is brought from the field throughout Holland. It is always carried to the towns in light waggons, or carts, drawn frequently by hor&s;es as &s;leek and well|conditioned as tho&s;e in our be&s;t coaches.</P>
<P>The hamlet, at which we were to embark, was bu&s;ied in celebrating &s;ome holiday. At the only cottage, that had a &s;ign, we applied for refre&s;hment, partly for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing its in&s;ide, by which we were not a little gratified. Thirty or forty pea&s;ants were &s;eated upon
<PB N="8" REF="16">
benches, about a circle, in which children were dancing to the &s;craping of a French fiddler. The women wore their large hats, &s;et up in the air like a &s;pread fan, and lined with dama&s;k, or flowered linen. Children of &s;even years old, as well as women of &s;eventy, were in this prepo&s;terous di&s;gui&s;e. All had necklaces, ear-rings, and ornamental cla&s;ps for the temples, of &s;olid gold: &s;ome wore large black patches of the &s;ize of a &s;hilling. The old woman of the hou&s;e had a valuable necklace and head-dre&s;s. Among the group were many of Teniers' beauties; and over the countenances of the whole a&s;&s;emblage was an air of mode&s;ty, decorum, and tranquillity. The children left their dancing, to &s;ee us; and we had almo&s;t lo&s;t our tide to Rotterdam, by &s;taying to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>Our &s;ail up the Mae&s;e was very delightful. The river flows here with great dignity, and is animated with ve&s;&s;els of all countries pa&s;&s;ing to and from Rotterdam. The huge Archangelman, the lighter Ame|rican, the &s;mart, &s;wift Engli&s;hman, and the bulky Dutchman, exhibit a various &s;cene of &s;hipping, upon a noble &s;urface of water, winding between green pa&s;tures and rich villages, &s;pread along the low &s;hores, where pointed roofs, trees, and ma&s;ts of fi&s;hing-boats, are &s;een mingled in &s;triking confu&s;ion. Small trading &s;chuyts, as &s;tout and as round as their ma&s;ters, glided by us, with crews repo&s;ing under their deep orange &s;ails, and frequently exchanging &s;ome &s;alute with our cap|tain. On our left, we pa&s;&s;ed the little town of Flaarding, celebrated for its &s;hare of the herring-fi&s;hery on our coa&s;ts; and Schiedam, a larger port, where what is called the Rotterdam geneva is made, and
<PB N="9" REF="17">
where &s;everal Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els were vi&s;ible in the chief &s;treet of the place. After a &s;ail of two hours we di&s;tingui&s;hed Rotterdam, &s;ur|rounded by more wood than had yet appeared, and overtopped by the heavy round tower of the great church of St. Lawrence. The flat|ne&s;s of its &s;ituation did not allow us here to judge of its extent; but we &s;oon perceived the grandeur of an ample city, extending along the north &s;hore of the Mae&s;e, that, now &s;preading into a noble bay, along the margin of which Rotterdam ri&s;es, &s;weeps towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The part of the city fir&s;t &s;een, from the river, is &s;aid to be among the fine&s;t in Europe for magnificence and convenience of &s;ituation. It is called the <HI>Boom Quay, i. e.</HI> the quay with trees, having rows of lofty elms upon the broad terrace, that &s;upports many noble hou&s;es, but which is called a quay, becau&s;e &s;hips of con&s;iderable burthen may moor again&s;t it, and deliver their cargoes. The merchants accordingly, who have re&s;idences here, have their warehou&s;es adjoining their hou&s;es, and frequently build them in the form of dome&s;tic offices. The quay is &s;aid to be a mile in length, but appears to be &s;omewhat le&s;s. There are hou&s;es upon it, as hand&s;ome as any in the &s;quares of London.</P>
<P>At the top of the <HI>Boom Quay</HI> is one of the <HI>Heads,</HI> or entrances by water into the city, through which the greater part of its numerous canals receive their &s;upplies. On the approach to it, the view further up the Mae&s;e detains attention to the bank of this noble river. A va&s;t building, erected for the Admiralty, is made, by a bend of the Mae&s;e, almo&s;t to face you; and the interval, of more than a quarter
<PB N="10" REF="18">
of a mile, is filled by a line of hou&s;es, that open directly, and without a terrace, upon the water. The fronts of the&s;e are in another &s;treet; but they all exhibit, even on this &s;ide, what is the di&s;tinction of Dutch hou&s;es and towns, a nicety and a perfectne&s;s of pre&s;ervation, which give them an air of gaiety without, and pre&s;ent you with an idea of comfort within. What in England would be thought a &s;ymptom of extraordinary wealth, or extravagance, is here univer&s;al. The out&s;ide of every hou&s;e, however old or humble, is as clean as water and paint can make it. The window-&s;hutters are u&s;ually coloured green; and whatever wood appears, whether in cornices or wor&s;e ornaments, is &s;o frequently cleaned, as well as painted, that it has always the glo&s;s of newne&s;s. Grote&s;que ornaments are &s;ometimes by the&s;e means ren|dered con&s;picuous; and a &s;treet acquires the air of a town in a toy|&s;hop; but in general there is not in this re&s;pect &s;uch a want of ta&s;te as can much dimini&s;h the value of their care.</P>
<P>Our &s;kipper reached his birth, which is con&s;tantly in the &s;ame place, &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Head,</HI> and entering by a canal into one of the principal &s;treets of the city. Between the broad terraces of this &s;treet, which are edged with thick elms, the innumerable ma&s;ts of Dutch &s;chuyts, with gay pendants and gilded tops; the hulls of larger ve&s;&s;els from all parts of the world; the white drawbridges, covered with pa&s;&s;engers; the boats, continually moving, without noi&s;e or ap|parent difficulty; all this did &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;e us, who had &s;up|po&s;ed that a city &s;o familiarly known, and yet &s;o little mentioned as Rotterdam, could have nothing &s;o remarkable as its wealth and trade.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="19">
In our way from the boat to the inn, other fine canals opened upon us on each &s;ide, and we looked at them till we had lo&s;t the man, whom we &s;hould have followed with our baggage. We had no fear that it would be &s;tolen, knowing the infrequency of robberies in Holland; and the fir&s;t per&s;on, of whom we could enquire our way in broken Dutch, acknowledged his country people by an&s;wering in very good Engli&s;h. There are many hundreds of Briti&s;h re&s;idents in this place, and our language and commerce have greatly the &s;way here over tho&s;e of all other foreign nations. The Dutch in&s;criptions over ware|hou&s;es and &s;hops have frequently Engli&s;h tran&s;lations underneath them. Of large ve&s;&s;els, there are nearly as many Engli&s;h as Dutch in the harbour; and, if you &s;peak to any Dutchman in the &s;treet, it is more probable that he can an&s;wer in Engli&s;h than in French. On a Sunday, the Engli&s;h fill two churches, one of which we at|tended on our return. It is an oblong brick building, permitted by the States to be within the juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop of London, Par|liament having given 2500 l. towards its completion in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century. There are al&s;o many Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters here, who are &s;aid to have their offices of wor&s;hip performed with the ability, &s;implicity, and zeal, which are u&s;ually to be ob&s;erved in the devotions of that cla&s;s of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Rotterdam is the &s;econd city for &s;ize, and perhaps the fir&s;t for beauty, in the United Provinces; yet, when we walked through it the next day, and expected to find the magnificence of the approach equalled in its interior, we were compelled to withdraw a little of the
<PB N="12" REF="20">
premature admiration, that had begun to extend to the whole place. The &s;treet, where there is mo&s;t trade and the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;age, the <HI>Hoog&s;traat,</HI> is little wider, though it is abundantly cleaner, than a London lane. The Stadthou&s;e is in this &s;treet, and is an old brick building, with a peaked roof, not entirely free from fanta&s;tic ornament. It has been built too early to have the advantages of modern elegance, and too late for the &s;anction of ancient dignity. The market-place has only one wide acce&s;s; and the communication between the &s;treet, from the principal <HI>Head,</HI> and that in which the Exchange is placed, is partly through a very narrow, though a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age. The Exchange it&s;elf is a plain &s;tone building, well de&s;igned for its pur|po&s;e, and completed about fifty years ago. The happie&s;t circum|&s;tance relating to it is, that the merchants are numerous enough to fill the colonnades on the four &s;ides of its interior. Commerce, which cannot now be long di&s;couraged in any part of Europe, becau&s;e with|out it the intere&s;t of public debts cannot be paid, is the permanent defender of freedom and knowledge again&s;t military glory and politics.</P>
<P>From the Exchange there is an excellent walk to the market-place, where the well-known &s;tatue of ERASMUS is rai&s;ed. Being repre|&s;ented in his doctor's dre&s;s, the figure can di&s;play little of the arti&s;t's &s;kill; but the countenance has &s;trong lines, and a phy&s;iognomi&s;t would not deny them to be expre&s;&s;ive of the di&s;cernment and &s;hrewdne&s;s of the original.</P>
<P>The market-place is really a large bridge, for a canal pa&s;&s;es under it; but its &s;ize, and the ea&s;ine&s;s of a&s;cent from the &s;ides, prevent this
<PB N="13" REF="21">
from being immediately ob&s;erved. Some of the &s;urrounding hou&s;es have their dates marked upon glazed tiles. They were built during the long war, that re&s;cued the provinces from the Spani&s;h dominion; a time when it might be &s;uppo&s;ed that nothing would have been at|tended to, except the bu&s;ine&s;s of providing daily food, and the duty of re&s;i&s;ting the enemy; but in which the Dutch enlarged and beautified their cities, prepared their country to become a medium of com|merce, and began nearly all the mea&s;ures, which have led to their pre|&s;ent exten&s;ive pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Near this place is the great church of St. LAWRENCE, which we entered, but did not find to be remarkable, except for a magnificent bra&s;s balu&s;trade that cro&s;&s;es it at the upper end. A profu&s;ion of <HI>achievements,</HI> which cover the walls almo&s;t to the top, contribute to its &s;olemnity. In addition to the arms of the decea&s;ed, they contain the dates of their birth and death, and are u&s;ed in&s;tead of in&s;criptions, though no names are expre&s;&s;ed upon them. Under the pulpit was an hour-gla&s;s, which limits the di&s;cour&s;e of the preacher: on one &s;ide a wand, having at the end a velvet bag and a &s;mall bell; this is carried about, during an interval in the &s;ervice, and every body puts &s;omething into it for the poor. The old beadle, who &s;hewed us the church, laid his hands upon us with plea&s;ure, when he heard that we were Engli&s;h, and Prote&s;tants. There are three mini&s;ters to this church, with &s;alaries of nearly two hundred pounds &s;terling each.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="22">
We went to our inn through the <HI>Hoog&s;traat,</HI> which was filled with people and carriages, but has no rai&s;ed pavement to &s;eparate the one from the other. In all the towns which we &s;aw, the footpath is di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the road only by being paved with a &s;ort of light coloured brick. The Dutch &s;hops are in the &s;hape, which tho&s;e of London are de&s;cribed to have had fifty years &s;ince, with &s;mall high windows, and blocks between them and the &s;treet. Silver&s;miths expo&s;e their goods in &s;mall gla&s;s cupboards upon the blocks, and nearly all the trades make upon them what little &s;hew is cu&s;tomary. Almo&s;t every tenth hou&s;e di&s;plays the in&s;cription <HI>Tabak te koop,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Tobacco to be &s;old."</Q> This &s;treet, having no canal, is occupied en|tirely by retail traders. We bought in it the Antwerp Gazette for two doights, or one farthing; &s;trawberries, large and well coloured, at a lower price than they could be had &s;ix weeks later in England, but without flavour; and went into &s;everal book&s;ellers' &s;hops, ex|pecting to have found &s;omething in Latin, or French, but could &s;ee only Dutch books. In another &s;treet a book&s;eller had &s;everal En|gli&s;h volumes, and there are no doubt well filled &s;hops, but not &s;o numerous as that we could find any.</P>
<P>Over the canals, that flow through almo&s;t every &s;treet of Rot|terdam, are great numbers of large drawbridges, which contribute much to the neat and gay appearance of the city; but, when the&s;e are rai&s;ed, the ob&s;truction to the pa&s;&s;age occa&s;ions crowds on each &s;ide; and, therefore, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t frequented parts, the bridges are entire and permanent, except for the breadth of three feet in the
<PB N="15" REF="23">
centre, where there is a plank, which opens upon hinges almo&s;t as ea&s;ily as the lid of a trunk. Through this opening the ma&s;ts of the &s;mall Dutch &s;chuyts are ea&s;ily conducted, but &s;hips can pa&s;s only where there are drawbridges. The number of the former is im|men&s;e; for, throughout the provinces, every village, if it is near a ca|nal, has &s;everal &s;chuyts, which carry away the &s;uperfluous produce of the country, and return with the manufactures, or &s;tores of the towns. But neither their number, nor their neatne&s;s, is &s;o remarkable as the ea&s;e and &s;tillne&s;s, with which they traver&s;e the city; and indeed ea&s;e and &s;tillne&s;s are much the characteri&s;tics of all the efforts of Dutch indu&s;try. The noi&s;e and agitation, u&s;ual whenever many per&s;ons are employed together in other countries, are unknown here. Ships are brought to their moorings, &s;chuyts pa&s;s each other in crowded canals, heavy burthens are rai&s;ed and cargoes removed, al|mo&s;t without a word, that can be heard at twenty yards di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance, rendering Dutch towns freer from noi&s;e than others of equal traffic, is the little u&s;e which is made of wag|gons and carts, even where &s;ome &s;ort of land carriage mu&s;t be em|ployed. Heavy commodities are u&s;ually carried about the &s;treets on &s;ledges; and almo&s;t the greate&s;t noi&s;e is, when the driver of one of the&s;e, after having delivered his load, meaning to render him&s;elf a prodigy of frolic&s;omene&s;s, &s;tands upon the hinder edges of his &s;ledge, and then, preventing him&s;elf from falling backward by his hold of the reins, is drawn rapidly through the admiring crowd.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="24">
We were long enough at Rotterdam, during three vi&s;its, to &s;ee how well it is provided with avenues towards the country and along the banks of the Mae&s;e. To one of the&s;e the way is over the two <HI>Heads,</HI> or chief canals, each of which you cro&s;s for a doight, or half a farthing, in boats that are continually pa&s;&s;ing between the two &s;ides. This little voyage &s;aves a walk of about three hundred yards to the neare&s;t bridge. The boats will hold twenty or thirty per&s;ons, and the profit of them is very con&s;iderable to the City government, which applies the money to public purpo&s;es. Each boat is worked by one man, who pulls it over by a rope in a about two minutes.</P>
<P>Many of the inhabitants have what they call garden-hou&s;es upon the&s;e walks, and upon a &s;emi-circular road, which pa&s;&s;es on the land &s;ide of the city; but the mo&s;t wealthy have &s;eats at greater di&s;tances, where they can be &s;urrounded with grounds, and make the di&s;play of independent re&s;idences.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Rotterdam has from its &s;ituation many conve|niences and delights, and from its &s;tructure &s;ome magnificence, to|gether with a general neatne&s;s; but is, for the mo&s;t part, de&s;icient in elegance, and its beauties have too much the air of prettine&s;&s;es. The canals are indi&s;putably fine, crowned with lofty terraces, and deep enough to carry large ve&s;&s;els into the centre of the city.</P>

<HEAD>DELFT.</HEAD>
<P>BETWEEN Rotterdam and this place we commenced our travelling in trecht&s;chuyts, which are too well known to need de&s;crip|tion. The fare is at the rate of about a penny per mile, and a trifle more hires the <HI>roof,</HI> which is a &s;mall &s;eparate chamber, neare&s;t to the &s;tern of the ve&s;&s;el, lighted by windows on each &s;ide. In engaging this, you have an in&s;tance of the accuracy of the Dutch in their minute&s;t tran&s;actions; a formal printed receipt, or ticket, is given for the few pence which it co&s;ts, by a commi&s;&s;ary, who has no other bu&s;ine&s;s than to regulate the affairs of the trecht&s;chuyts at his gate of the city. We could never learn what proportion of the fare is paid as a tax to the State, but it is &s;aid to be a con&s;iderable part; and not only the&s;e &s;chuyts, but the ferries, the po&s;t waggons, and the pilotage throughout the United States, are made contributory to the public funds.</P>
<P>The punctuality of the departure and arrival of the trecht&s;chuyts is well known, and ju&s;tifies the Dutch method of reckoning di&s;tances, which is by hours, and not by leagues or miles. The canals being generally full to the brim, the top of the ve&s;&s;el is above the level of the adjoining country, and the view over it is of cour&s;e exten&s;ive; but

<PB N="18" REF="26">
the hou&s;es and gardens, which are be&s;t worth &s;eeing, are almo&s;t always upon the banks of the canal. We pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;uch in the way to Delft, towards which the Rotterdam merchants have their favourite &s;eats; but Dutch gardens are rather to be noticed by an Engli&s;hman as curio&s;ities, than as luxuries. It is not only by the known ill ta&s;te of their ornaments, but by the effects of climate and the &s;oil, that gardens are deprived of value, in a country, where the moi&s;ture is &s;o di&s;proportioned to the heat, that the verdure, though bright, has no fragrance, and the fruit, at its utmo&s;t &s;ize, &s;carcely any flavour.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age of two hours brought us to Delft, which we had expected to find a &s;mall and ill-inhabited place, knowing it to be not now occu|pied by any con&s;iderable trade. Our inn, we &s;uppo&s;ed, mu&s;t be within a few minutes walk. We proceeded, however, through one &s;treet for half a mile, and, after &s;ome turnings, did not reach our inn, though we were led by the neare&s;t way, in le&s;s than twenty minutes. During all this time we were upon the terraces of clear canals, among&s;t excellent hou&s;es, with a &s;mall intermixture of &s;hops and &s;ome public buildings. The mingled admiration and wearine&s;s, which we felt here, for the fir&s;t time, have been, however, often repeated; for if there is a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;aying what is the next di&s;tinction of Dutch towns, after their neatne&s;s, their &s;ize mu&s;t be in&s;i&s;ted upon. There are Dutch villages, &s;carcely marked in a map, which exceed in &s;ize &s;ome of the county towns in England. <HI>Mae&s;land Sluice,</HI> a place oppo&s;ite to the Brill, is one. And here is Delft, a place with &s;carcely any other trade than con&s;i&s;ts in the circulation of commodities from Rotterdam
<PB N="19" REF="27">
through &s;ome neighbouring villages; which is not the &s;eat of any con&s;iderable part of the national government, and is inferior, in point of &s;ituation, to all the &s;urrounding towns. Delft, thus undi&s;tingui&s;hed, fills a large circumference, with &s;treets &s;o intricately thick, that we never went from our inn without lo&s;ing our way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doolen,</HI> one of the be&s;t inns in Holland, is a large building of the &s;ixteenth century, rai&s;ed by the Spaniards, and fir&s;t intended to be a convent; but, having been u&s;ed by the burghers of Delft for public purpo&s;es, during the &s;truggle of the Provinces again&s;t Spain, it is now venerable as the &s;cene of their councils and preparations. In the &s;uite of large apartments, which were u&s;ed by them, &s;ome of the city bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;till tran&s;acted, and in the&s;e &s;trangers are never entertained. Behind, is a bowling-green, in which the burghers to this day per|form their military exerci&s;es: they were &s;o employed when we came in; and it was plea&s;ing to con&s;ider, that their inferiority to their an|ce&s;tors, in point of martial appearance, was the re&s;ult of the long in|ternal peace &s;ecured by the exertions of the latter.</P>
<P>Over two arches of the building is the date of its erection, 1565, the year in which the de&s;truction of all families, profe&s;&s;ing the Pro|te&s;tant religion either in France or Spain, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been agreed upon at Bayonne between the &s;overeigns of the two countries, and one year preceding the fir&s;t mea&s;ures of confederate re&s;i&s;tance in the Low Countries, which that and other efforts of per&s;ecution pro|duced. One of the&s;e arches communicates with the rooms &s;o long u&s;ed by the burghers; and our ho&s;te&s;s, an intelligent woman, accom|panied
<PB N="20" REF="28">
us through them. The fir&s;t is ornamented with three large pictures, repre&s;enting &s;everal of the early burghers of the Common|wealth, either in arms or council. A portrait of BARNEVELDT is marked with the date and the painter's name, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"MICHAEL MIERE|VELD <HI>delineavit ac perfunctori&egrave; pinxit,</HI> 1617,"</Q> one year before the flagitious arre&s;t of BARNEVELDT, in defiance of the con&s;titution of the provinces, by MAURICE of ORANGE. A piece, exhibiting &s;ome of the burghers in arms, men of an hand&s;ome and heroic appearance; is al&s;o dated, by having 1648 painted on a drum; that, which &s;hews them in council, has a portrait of GROTIUS, painted when he was &s;eventeen. His face is the &s;eventh from the right hand in the &s;econd row.</P>
<P>Beyond this room are others containing &s;everal &s;core of &s;mall cup|boards, on the doors of each of which are two or three blazonries of arms. Here are depo&s;ited &s;ome parts of the dre&s;s and arms of an a&s;|&s;ociation of Arque&s;bu&s;iers, u&s;ual in all the Dutch towns; the members of which &s;ociety a&s;&s;emble annually in October, to &s;hoot at a target placed in a pavilion of the old convent garden. The mark&s;man takes his aim from the farthe&s;t room; and between him and the mark are two walls, perforated two feet and a half in length, and eight inches in breadth, to permit the pa&s;&s;age of the &s;hot. A man &s;tands in the pa|vilion, to tell where the ball has &s;truck; and every mark&s;man, before he &s;hoots, rings a bell, to warn this per&s;on out of the way. He that fir&s;t hits a white &s;pot in the target, has his liquor, for the en&s;uing year, free of exci&s;e duty; but, to render this more difficult, a &s;tork is

<PB N="21" REF="29">
&s;u&s;pended by the legs from a &s;tring, which, pa&s;&s;ing down the whole length of the target, is kept in continual motion by the agitation of the bird. It did not appear whether the &s;tork has any other &s;hare in this ancient ceremony, which is repre&s;ented in prints of con&s;iderable date. It is held near the ground, out of the way of the &s;hot, and is certainly not intended to be hurt, for the Dutch have no ta&s;te for cruelty in their amu&s;ements. The &s;tork, it is al&s;o known, is e&s;teem|ed by them a fort of tutelary bird; as it once was in Rome, where ASELLUS SEMPRONIUS RUFUS, who fir&s;t had them &s;erved at an entertainment, is &s;aid to have lo&s;t the Praetor&s;hip for his &s;acrilegious gluttony. In the&s;e trivial enquiries we pa&s;&s;ed our fir&s;t evening at Delft.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, a battalion of regular troops was reviewed upon a &s;mall plain within the walls of the town. The uniform is blue and red, in which the Dutch officers have not quite the &s;mart appearance of ours. One of the&s;e, who gave the word to a company, was a boy, certainly not more than fifteen, who&s;e &s;hrill voice was lu|dicrou&s;ly heard between the earne&s;t &s;houts of the others. The firing was very exact, which is all that we can tell of the qualities of a review.</P>
<P>Delft was a place of early importance in the United Provinces, being one of the &s;ix original cities, that &s;ent deputies to the States of the province; a privilege, which, at the in&s;tance of their glorious WILLIAM the Fir&s;t of ORANGE, was afterwards properly extended to twelve others, including Rotterdam and the Brill. Yet it is little
<PB N="22" REF="30">
celebrated for military events, being unfortified, and having probably always obeyed the fortune of the neighbouring places. The circum|&s;tance which gives it a melancholy place in hi&s;tory, is the murder of the wi&s;e and beneficent Prince who founded the republic. His palace, a plain brick building, is &s;till in good repair, where &s;trangers are always &s;hewn the &s;tairca&s;e on which he fell, and the holes made in the wall by the &s;hot that killed him. The old man, who keeps the hou&s;e, told the &s;tory with as much agitation and intere&s;t as if it had happened ye&s;terday. <Q REND="inline">"The prince and prince&s;s came out of that chamber&mdash;here &s;tood the prince, here &s;tood the murderer; when the prince &s;tepped here to &s;peak to him about the pa&s;&s;port, the villain fired, and the prince fell all along here and died. Yes, &s;o it was&mdash;there are the holes the balls made."</Q> Over one of the&s;e, which is large enough to admit two fingers, is this in&s;cription:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Hier onder &s;taen de Teykenen der Kooglen daar meede Prins Willem van Orange is door&s;chootten op</HI> 10 July, A. 1584."</Q></P>
<P>To this dete&s;table action the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in acknowledged him&s;elf to have been in&s;tigated by the proclamation of Philip the Second, offering a reward for its perpetration. The prince&s;s, who had the wretched|ne&s;s to witne&s;s it, had lo&s;t her father and her former hu&s;band in the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew in France, which, though contrived by Catherine and Charles the Ninth of that country, is believed to have been the con&s;equence of their interview at Bayonne, with I&s;abella, the wife of the &s;ame Philip.</P>
<P>The melancholy excited on this &s;pot is continued by pa&s;&s;ing from
<PB N="23" REF="31">
it to the tomb of WILLIAM, in the great church, called the <HI>Nieuwe Kerk.</HI> There the gloomy pageantry of the black e&s;cutcheons, above a choir, &s;ilent, empty and va&s;t, and the withering remains of colours, won by hands long &s;ince gone to their decay, prolong the con&s;idera|tion of the tran&s;ientne&s;s of human worth and happine&s;s, which can &s;o ea&s;ily be de&s;troyed by the command, or the hand of human villainy.</P>
<P>This tomb is thought to be not exceeded by any piece of &s;epul|chral grandeur in Europe. Standing alone, in a wide choir, it is much more con&s;picuous and &s;triking than a monumental fabrick rai&s;ed again&s;t a wall, at the &s;ame time that its &s;ides are &s;o varied as to pre&s;ent each a new &s;pectacle. It was begun in 1609, by order of the States General, and completed in 1621; the arti&s;t, HENDRIK DE KEYZER, receiving 28,000 florins as its price, and 2000 more as a pre&s;ent. The length is 20 feet, the breadth 15, and height 27. A bronze &s;tatue of the prince, &s;itting in full armour, with his &s;word, &s;carf, and commander's &s;taff, renders one &s;ide the chief; on the other is his effigy in white marble, lying at full length; and at his feet, in the &s;ame marble, the figure of the dog, which is &s;aid to have refu&s;ed food from the moment of its ma&s;ter's death. Round the tomb, twenty|two columns of veined or black Italian marble, of the Doric order, and, with ba&s;es and capitals of white marble, &s;upport a roof or canopy, ornamented with many emblems, and with the <HI>achievements</HI> of the prince.</P>
<P>At the corners, are the &s;tatues of Religion, Liberty, Ju&s;tice, and
<PB N="24" REF="32">
Fortitude, of which the fir&s;t re&s;ts upon a piece of black marble, on which is in&s;cribed in golden letters the name of CHRIST; and the &s;e|cond holds a cap, with the in&s;cription <HI>Aurea Libertas.</HI> On the four &s;ides of the canopy are the devices of the prince, with the in&s;criptions JEHOVAH.&mdash;<HI>Je maintiendrai Pi&egrave;t&eacute; et Ju&s;tice.&mdash;Te vindice, tuta liber|tas.</HI>&mdash;And, <HI>Soevis tranquillus in undis.</HI></P>
<P>There are many other ornaments, which give dignity or elegance to the &s;tructure, but cannot be de&s;cribed without tediou&s;ne&s;s. The well-known Epitaph is certainly worth tran&s;cribing:</P>

The Confederated Belgic Provinces have erected this monument, in perpetual memory of this truly pious, prudent and unconquered Hero, whom Philip II. King of Spain, the dread of Europe, dreaded; never overcame, never ter|rified; but, with wicked treachery, carried off by means of an hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in."</Q></P>
<P>The tomb of GROTIUS is in the &s;ame church, which is a &s;tately building of brick and &s;tone, but has nothing of the <Q REND="inline">"dim religious light,"</Q> that &s;ooths the mind in Gothic &s;tructures. Upon the &s;teeple are many &s;mall bells, the chimes rung upon which are particularly e&s;teemed, both for tone and tune.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of a very large market-place is the town|hou&s;e, an old building, but &s;o fre&s;h and &s;o fanta&s;tic with paint, as to have &s;ome re&s;emblance to a Chine&s;e temple. The body is coloured with a light, or yellowi&s;h brown, and is two &s;tories high to the roof, in which there are two tier of peaked windows, each under its ornament of gilded wood, carved into an awkward re&s;emblance of &s;hells. Upon the front is in&s;cribed, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Delphen&s;ium Curia Reparata,</HI>"</Q> and im|mediately over the door <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Reparata</HI> 1761."</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Oude Kerk,</HI> or Old Church, is in another part of the town, and is not remarkable, except for the tombs of LEUWENHOEK, PETER HEINE and VAN TROMP. That of LEUWENHOEK has a &s;hort in|&s;cription, in Latin almo&s;t as bad as that of a ver&s;e epitaph upon
<PB N="26" REF="34">
GROTIUS in the other church. He was born, it appears, in Octo|ber 1632, and died in Augu&s;t 1723. The tombs of HEINE and VAN TROMP are very hand&s;ome. There are the effigies of both in white marble, and one of the victories gained by the latter is repre&s;ented in <HI>alto relievo.</HI> On account of the tombs, both churches are open, during certain hours in the day; and a beadle, or, perhaps, an alms|man, is placed in each, who pre&s;ents a padlocked box, into which money may be put for the poor.</P>
<P>In this town is the chief ar&s;enal of the province of Holland, except that the magazine of powder is at the di&s;tance of about a mile from it, near the canal to Rotterdam. In 1787, when the di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the STATES GENERAL and the PRINCE of ORANGE were at their height, a provincial free corps &s;eized this ar&s;enal, and held it for the States till the return of the PRINCE of ORANGE to the Hague, a few weeks afterwards.</P>
<P>Having &s;een what was pointed out to our notice at Delft, and learned that its exten&s;ivene&s;s was owing to the re&s;idence of a great number of retired merchants from Rotterdam, we left it in a <HI>trecht|&s;chuyt</HI> for the Hague, having little other notion of it in our minds, than that it is very dull and very rich, and of a &s;ize, for which there is no recompen&s;e to a &s;tranger, except in con&s;idering, that its dullne&s;s is the re&s;t of tho&s;e, who have once been bu&s;y, and that its riches are at lea&s;t not employed in aggravating the mi&s;eries of poverty by o&s;tentation.</P>

<HEAD>THE HAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>A VOYAGE of an hour and a half brought us here over a ca|nal well bordered by country hou&s;es and gardens, all of which, as in other parts of Holland, have &s;ome in&s;cription upon their gates, to &s;ay, that they are plea&s;ant, or are intended for plea&s;ure. <HI>Fine Sight, Plea&s;ant Re&s;t, High Delight,</HI> or &s;ome &s;imilar in&s;cription, is to be &s;een over the door of every country hou&s;e, in gold letters. On our way, we looked for Ry&s;wick, where the treaty of 1697 was &s;igned, and &s;aw the village, but not the palace, which, being of free &s;tone, is men|tioned as a &s;ort of curio&s;ity in the country. It is this palace, which is &s;aid to contain proofs of an extraordinary di&s;pute upon que&s;tions of ceremony. The Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ent to prepare the treaty, are re|lated to have contended &s;o long, concerning their rights of precedence, that the only mode of reconciling them was to make &s;eparate en|trances, and to allow the Mediating Mini&s;ter alone admi&s;&s;ion by the principal gate.</P>
<P>From the <HI>trecht&s;chuyt</HI> we had a long walk to our inn, an hand&s;ome hou&s;e, &s;tanding almo&s;t in the mid&s;t of palaces, and looking over a noble &s;heet of water, called the <HI>Vyver,</HI> which extends behind the <HI>Court,</HI> for its whole length, flowing nearly to the level of the lower windows.
<PB N="28" REF="36">
The <HI>Court</HI> it&s;elf, a large brick building, irregular, but light and plea|&s;ant, was entirely within our view, on the left; on the right, a row of magnificent hou&s;es, &s;eparated from the <HI>Vyver</HI> by a large mall; and, in front, beyond the <HI>Vyver,</HI> a broad place, bordered by &s;everal public buildings. In this Court all the &s;uperior colleges of government have their chambers, and the PRINCE of ORANGE his &s;uite of apartments. The fo&s;&s;&eacute;, which &s;urrounds it, three drawbridges and as many gates are the only fortifications of the Hague, which has been &s;everal times threatened with the entrance of an enemy, but has not been taken &s;ince 1595, when the magi&s;trates of the then infant republic, and all the &s;uperior inhabitants, retired to <HI>Delft,</HI> leaving the &s;treets to be over-run with gra&s;s, and the place to become a de&s;ert under the eyes of its oppre&s;&s;ors. During the inva&s;ion of LOUIS the FOURTEENTH, it e&s;caped the ravages of the DUKE of LUXEMBOURG's column, by the &s;udden di&s;&s;olution of the ice, on which he had placed 9000 foot and 2000 cavalry. Yet the advice of WILLIAM the THIRD, who probably thought money better expended in &s;trengthening the fron|tier than the interior of the country, counteracted a plan of fortifica|tion, which was then propo&s;ed, for the third or fourth time.</P>
<P>The Court con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;quares; in the inner of which are the apartments of the STADTHOLDER, and none but him&s;elf and his family can enter this in carriages, or on hor&s;eback. On the northern &s;ide, in the fir&s;t floor, are the apartments of the STATES GENERAL, which we &s;aw. The principal one is &s;pacious, as a room, but has not the air of a hall of debate. Twenty-&s;ix chairs for the Deputies are placed
<PB N="29" REF="37">
on two &s;ides of a long table: the Pre&s;ident, who&s;e chair is in the centre, has on his right hand, fir&s;t, a Deputy of his own province, then three Deputies of Frie&s;land, and two of Groningen; on his left, &s;ix Deputies of Holland; oppo&s;ite to him, neare&s;t to the head of the table, &s;ix Deputies of Guelderland, then three of Zealand, then two of Utrecht, and two of Overy&s;&s;el. The STADTHOLDER, who has a place, but not a vote, has a rai&s;ed chair at the upper end of the table; the Secretary is &s;eated oppo&s;ite to him, and is allowed to wear his hat, like the Deputies, during their deliberations, but mu&s;t &s;tand uncovered, behind the Pre&s;ident, when he reads letters, or other papers. The number of Deputies is known to be indefinite; about fifty are gene|rally returned; and tho&s;e, who are pre&s;ent from each province, more than the number allowed at the table, place them&s;elves below it. The walls of this room are covered with tape&s;try, not repre&s;enting hi&s;to|rical events, but rural &s;cenery; the backs and &s;eats of the chairs are of green velvet; and all the furniture, though &s;tately and in the be&s;t condition, is without the lea&s;t approach to &s;hew. The&s;e apartments, and the whole of this &s;ide of the Court, were the re&s;idence of CHARLES the FIFTH, when he vi&s;ited the Hague, and of the EARL of LEICESTER, when he commanded the troops lent to the Republic by ELIZABETH.</P>
<P>The government of the United Provinces is too well known to permit a detailed de&s;cription here, but &s;ome notice may rea&s;onably be expected of it.</P>
<P>The chief depo&s;itaries of the &s;overeignty are not the States Gene|ral, but the Provincial States, of who&s;e Deputies the former body is
<PB N="30" REF="38">
compo&s;ed, and without who&s;e con&s;ent they never vote upon important mea&s;ures. In the States General each Province has one vote; which, with the rea&s;ons for it, may be delivered by an unlimited number of Deputies; and the fir&s;t Deputy of each province pre&s;ides in the States by rotation for a week. In que&s;tions relative to peace or war, alliances, taxes, coinages, and to the privileges of provinces, no mea&s;ures can be taken but by unanimous con&s;ent; upon other occa&s;ions, a majority is &s;ufficient. No per&s;ons holding military offices can be Deputies to the States General, which appoints and receives all am|ba&s;&s;adors, declares war, makes peace, and names the Greffier, or Se|cretary of State, and all Staff Officers.</P>
<P>The Provincial States are variou&s;ly compo&s;ed, and the interior go|vernments of the provinces variou&s;ly formed. In the province of Holland, which contains the mo&s;t pro&s;perous part of the Republic, there are eighteen Deputies to the Provincial States, for as many towns, and one for the nobility. The Grand Pen&s;ionary pre&s;ides in this a&s;&s;embly, and is always one of the Deputies from it to the States General.</P>
<P>The Council of Deputies is compo&s;ed of ten members: nine from the towns, and one from the nobility. This Council, in which the Grand Pen&s;ionary al&s;o pre&s;ides, regulates the finances of the pro|vince, and takes cognizance of the di&s;tribution of troops within it.</P>
<P>The Council, called the Council of State, is compo&s;ed, like the States General, of Deputies returned from the provinces, and ap|pears to be to that body, in a great mea&s;ure, what the Council of
<PB N="31" REF="39">
Deputies is to the Provincial States, having the direction of the army and the finances.</P>
<P>As provincial affairs are directed by the Provincial States, &s;o the affairs of each town are governed by its own Senate, which al&s;o re|turns the members, if the town is entitled to &s;end one, to the States of the Province, and directs the vote, which that member &s;hall give. The Burgoma&s;ters in each town are the magi&s;trates charged with the police and the finances, and are u&s;ually elected annually by the old Council, that is, by tho&s;e who have been Burgoma&s;ters, or <HI>Echevins.</HI> The&s;e latter officers have the admini&s;tration of civil and criminal af|fairs, and are, in &s;ome places, appointed by the Stadtholder from a double number nominated to him; in others, are accepted from the recommendation of the Stadholder. The Bailiffs pre&s;ide in the Coun|cil of Burgoma&s;ters and Echevins; and in their name pro&s;ecutions are in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>Of the Deputies to the States General, &s;ome are for life, and &s;ome for one or more years.</P>
<P>Such is the nicely complicated frame of this government, in which the Senates of the Towns elect the Provincial States, and the Provincial States the States General; the latter body being incapable of deciding in certain ca&s;es, except with unanimity and with the expre&s;s con&s;ent of their con&s;tituents, the Provincial States; who again cannot give that con&s;ent, except with unanimity and with the con&s;ent of their con&s;tituents, the Senates.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="40">
The Stadtholder, it is &s;een, has not directly, and in con&s;equence of that office, any &s;hare of the legi&s;lative power; but, being a Noble of four provinces, he, of cour&s;e, participates in that part of the &s;ove|reignty, which the Nobility enjoy when they &s;end Deputies to the Pro|vincial States. Of Zealand he is the only Noble, all the other titled families having been de&s;troyed in the original conte&s;t with Spain; and there are no renewals or creations of titles in the United Provinces. In Guelderland, Holland, and Utrecht, he is Pre&s;ident of the Nobles. He is Commander of all the Forces of the Republic by &s;ea and land; and the Council of State, of which he is a member, is, in military af|fairs, almo&s;t entirely under his direction; he names all &s;ubaltern offi|cers, and recommends tho&s;e for higher appointments to the States General. In Guelderland, Utrecht, and overy&s;&s;el, which are called <HI>Provinces aux Reglemens,</HI> becau&s;e, having &s;ubmitted to LOUIS the FOURTEENTH, in 1672, they were not re-admitted to the Union, but with &s;ome &s;acrifice of their privileges, he appoints to offices, without the nomination of the cities; he is Governor General of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indian Companies, and names all the Directors from a treble number of candidates offered by the Proprietors. His name pre&s;ides in all the courts of law; and his heart, it may be hoped, dictates in the noble right of pardoning.</P>
<P>This is the e&s;&s;ential form of a government, which, for two centu|ries, has protected as great a &s;hare of civil and religious liberty as has been enjoyed in any other part of Europe, re&s;i&s;ting equally the
<PB N="33" REF="41">
chances of di&s;&s;olution, contained within it&s;elf; and the le&s;s dangerous &s;chemes for its de&s;truction, dictated by the jealou&s;y of arbitrary in|tere&s;ts without.</P>
<P>Its intricacy and delicacy are ea&s;ily &s;een; yet, of the objections made to it on this account, more are founded on &s;ome maxims, a&s;|&s;umed to be univer&s;al, than upon the &s;eparate con&s;iderations due to the condition of a &s;eparate people. How much the means of politi|cal happine&s;s depend, for their effect, upon the civil characters of tho&s;e for whom they are de&s;igned, has been very little &s;een, or in|&s;i&s;ted upon. It has been unnoticed, becau&s;e &s;uch enquiries have not the brilliancy, or the facility, of general &s;peculations, nor can com|mand equal attention, nor equally reward &s;y&s;tems with tho&s;e parts of their importance, that con&s;i&s;t in the immen&s;ity of the &s;phere, to which they pretend. To extend their arms is the flagitious ambition of war|riors; to enlarge their &s;y&s;tems is the ambition of writers, e&s;pecially of political writers. A ju&s;ter effort of under&s;tanding would aim at rendering the application of principles more exact, rather than more exten&s;ive, and would produce enquiries into the circum&s;tances of na|tional character and condition, that &s;hould regulate that application. A more mode&s;t e&s;timate of human means of doing good would &s;hew the gradations, through which all human advances mu&s;t be made. A more &s;evere integrity of views would &s;tipulate, that the means &s;hould be as hone&s;t as the end, and would &s;trive to a&s;certain, from the mo|ral and intellectual character of a people, the degree of political hap|pine&s;s, of which they are capable; a proce&s;s, without which projected
<PB N="34" REF="42">
advances become ob&s;tructions; and the philo&s;opher begins his expe|riment, for the amelioration of &s;ociety, as prematurely as the &s;culptor would poli&s;h his &s;tatue before he had delineated the features.</P>
<P>Whether the con&s;titution of the United Provinces is exactly as good an one as the people are capable of enjoying can be deter|mined only after a much longer and abler enquiry than we could make; but it &s;eemed proper to ob&s;erve, that, in judging this que&s;tion, it is not enough to di&s;cover better forms of government, without find|ing al&s;o &s;ome rea&s;on to believe, that the intellectual and moral condi|tion of the people would &s;ecure the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e better forms. In the mean time, they, who make the enquiry, may be a&s;&s;ured, that, under the pre&s;ent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">June 1794.</NOTE> government, there is a con&s;iderable degree of political liberty, though political happine&s;s is not permitted by the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Europe; that the general adoption of the Stadtholder's mea&s;ures by the States has been unduly mentioned to &s;hew an immoderate influence, for that, in point of fact, his mea&s;ures are often rejected; that this rejection produces no public agitation, nor can tho&s;e, who differ from him in opinion, be &s;ucce&s;sfully re|pre&s;ented as enemies to their country; that there are very few offices, which enable private per&s;ons to become rich, at the expence of the public, &s;o as to have a different intere&s;t from them; that the &s;ober in|du&s;try and plain manners of the people prevent them from looking to political conduct of any &s;ort as a means of improving their for|tunes; that, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, the intricate connections between the

parts of their government are le&s;s inconvenient than may be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ince good mea&s;ures will not be ob&s;tructed, or bad ones &s;upported, for corrupt purpo&s;es, though mi&s;conceptions may &s;ometimes produce nearly the &s;ame effect; that conver&s;ation is perfectly free; and that the habit of watching the &s;trength of parties, for the purpo&s;e of join|ing the &s;tronge&s;t and per&s;ecuting the weake&s;t, does not occupy the minds of any numerous cla&s;&s;es among&s;t them.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no other apartments than tho&s;e of the States General, the PRINCE of ORANGE being then in his own. The Prince&s;s was at a &s;eat in Guelderland, with her daughter-in-law, the wife of the Here|ditary Prince, who had been indi&s;po&s;ed &s;ince the &s;urpri&s;e of the Dutch troops at Menin, on the 12th of September 1793, in which affair her hu&s;band was engaged. When the officer, who brought the fir&s;t accounts, which were not written, to the Hague, had related that the younger prince was wounded, the Hereditary Prince&s;s enquired, with great eagerne&s;s, concerning his brother. The officer indi&s;creetly re|plied, that he knew nothing of him; which the Prince&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed to imply, that he was dead; and &s;he has &s;ince been &s;omewhat an invalid.</P>
<P>Though the &s;alaries enjoyed by the Prince of Orange, in con&s;e|quence of his offices, are by no means con&s;iderable, he is enabled, by his patrimonial e&s;tates, to maintain &s;ome mode&s;t &s;plendour. The Court is compo&s;ed of a grand ma&s;ter, a mar&s;hal, a grand equerry, ten chamberlains, five ladies of honour, and &s;ix gentlemen of the chamber. Ten young men, with the title of pages, are educated at the expence of the Prince, in a hou&s;e adjoining his <HI>manege.</HI> As
<PB N="36" REF="44">
Captain-General, he is allowed eight adjutants, and, as Admiral, three.</P>
<P>We could not learn the amount of the income enjoyed by the PRINCE of ORANGE, which mu&s;t, indeed, be very variable, ari&s;ing chiefly from his own e&s;tates. The greater part of the&s;e are in the pro|vince of Zealand, where &s;eventeen villages and part of the town of Breda are his property. The fortifications of &s;everal places there are &s;aid to have been chiefly erected at the expence of the Orange family. His farms in that neighbourhood &s;uffered greatly in the campaign of 1792, and this part of his income has &s;ince been much dimini&s;hed. The management of his revenues, derived from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Ger|many, affords employment to four or five per&s;ons, at an Office, &s;epa|rate from his ordinary Trea&s;ury; and he had e&s;tates in the Low Coun|tries. All this is but the wreck of a fortune, honourably dimini&s;hed by William the Fir&s;t of Orange, in the conte&s;t with Spain; the re|membrance of whom may, perhaps, involuntarily influence one's opinion of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>During May, the we&s;tern gate of the palace is ornamented, ac|cording to antient cu&s;tom, with garlands for each per&s;on of the Orange family. Chaplets, with the initials of each, in flowers, are placed under large coronets, upon green flag-&s;taffs. We pa&s;&s;ed by when they were taking the&s;e down, and perceived that all the ornaments could &s;carcely have co&s;t five &s;hillings. So humble are the Dutch no|tions of pageantry.</P>
<P>Among the offices included within the walls of the court is a printing-hou&s;e, in which the STATES GENERAL and the States
<PB N="37" REF="45">
of Holland employ only per&s;ons &s;worn to &s;ecrecy as to the papers committed to them. It may &s;eem &s;trange to require &s;ecrecy from tho&s;e, who&s;e art is chiefly u&s;eful in conferring publicity; but the truth is, that many papers are printed here, which are never commu|nicated to the public, the States employing the pre&s;s for the &s;ake of its cheapne&s;s, and con&s;idering that any of their members, who would &s;hew a printed paper, would do the &s;ame with a written one.</P>
<P>In a large &s;quare, near the court, is the cabinet of natural hi&s;tory, of which we have not the knowledge nece&s;&s;ary for giving a de&s;crip|tion. It is arranged in &s;mall rooms, which are opened, at twelve o'clock, to tho&s;e, who have applied the day before. One article, &s;aid to be very rare, and certainly very beautiful, was an animal of the Deer &s;pecies, about fourteen inches high, exqui&s;itely &s;haped and marked, and believed to be at its full growth. It was brought from the coa&s;t of Africa.</P>
<P>The Stadtholder's library was accidentally &s;hut, owing to the ill|ne&s;s of the librarian; the picture gallery was open, but of paintings we have re&s;olved to exempt our readers from any mention. The former is &s;aid to contain eight thou&s;and volumes, and fourteen thou&s;and prints in portfolios. Among the illuminated M SS. in vel|lum is one, u&s;ed by the &s;anguinary Catherine De Medicis and her children; and another, which belonged to I&s;abella of Ca&s;tille, the grandmother of Charles the Fifth. What mu&s;t be oddly placed in a library is a &s;uit of armour of Francis the Fir&s;t, which was once in the cabinet of Chri&s;tina of Sweden. Though this collection is the pri|vate
<PB N="38" REF="46">
property of the Prince, the librarian is permitted to lend books to per&s;ons, known to him and likely to u&s;e them advantageou&s;ly for &s;cience.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed a long morning in walking through the &s;treets of this place, which contain probably more magnificent hou&s;es than can be found in the &s;ame &s;pace in any city of Northern Europe. The Grand <HI>Voorhout</HI> is rather, indeed, two &s;eries of palaces than a &s;treet. Be|tween two broad carriage-ways, which pa&s;s immediately along the &s;ides, are &s;everal alleys of tall lime trees, canopying walks, fir&s;t laid out by Charles the Fifth, in 1536, and ordered to be carefully pre|&s;erved, the <HI>placard</HI> being &s;till extant, which directs the puni&s;hment of offenders again&s;t them. It would be tedious to mention the many &s;plendid buildings in this and the neighbouring &s;treets. Among the mo&s;t con&s;picuous is the pre&s;ent re&s;idence of the Briti&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors, built by HUGUETAN, the celebrated banker of LOUIS the FOUR|TEENTH, and that of the Ru&s;&s;ian Mini&s;ter, which was erected by the Pen&s;ionary BARNEVELDT. But the building, which was intended to exceed all others at the Hague, is the Hotel of the Prince of NASSAU WEILBOURG; who, having married the &s;i&s;ter of the Prince of ORANGE, bought, at an immen&s;e expence, eight good hou&s;es, facing the <HI>Voorhout,</HI> in order to erect upon their &s;cite a magnificent palace. What has been already built of this is extremely fine, in the cre&s;cent form; but a German, arriving to the expenditure of a Dutch fortune, probably did not e&s;timate it by Dutch prices. It was begun eighteen years &s;ince, and, for the la&s;t twelve, has not proceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="47">
Superb public buildings occur at almo&s;t every &s;tep through the Hague. At one end of the terrace, on which we were lodged, is the <HI>Doelen,</HI> a &s;pacious man&s;ion, opening partly upon the <HI>Tournois Veld,</HI> or Place of Tournaments. The burge&s;&s;es here keep their colours, and, what is remarkable, &s;till pre&s;erve the <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of the <HI>Toi&s;on d'Or,</HI> given to them by CHARLES the FIFTH. Our WILLIAM the THIRD being admitted, at ten years of age, to the right of a burge&s;s here, was inve&s;ted with this order by the Burgoma&s;ter. At the other end of the terrace is the palace, built for Prince MAURICE of NASSAU, up|on his return from the government of Brazil, by KAMPFEN, Lord of Rambroek, architect of the Stadthou&s;e at Am&s;terdam. The in|terior of this building was de&s;troyed by fire, in the commencement of the pre&s;ent century; but, the &s;tately walls of &s;tone and brick being uninjured, the rooms were re&s;tored by the proprietors, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a lottery. It is an in&s;tance of the abundance of buildings here, that this palace is now chiefly u&s;ed as a place of meeting, for the oeconomical branch of the &s;ociety of Haerlem, and for a &s;ociety, in&s;tituted here, for the encouragement of Dutch poetry.</P>
<P>The number of public buildings is much increa&s;ed by the hou&s;es, which the eighteen towns provide for their Deputies, &s;ent to the States of the Province. The&s;e are called the <HI>Logements</HI> of the &s;e|veral towns; and there has been a great deal of emulation, as to their magnificence. Am&s;terdam and Rotterdam have the fine&s;t.</P>
<P>The churches are not remarkable for antiquity, or grandeur. A congregation of Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants have their wor&s;hip performed, in
<PB N="40" REF="48">
the manner of the Di&s;&s;enters, in a &s;mall chapel near the <HI>Vyver,</HI> where we had the &s;atisfaction to hear their venerable pa&s;tor, the Rev. Dr. M'CLEAN.</P>
<P>The re&s;idence of a Court at the Hague renders the appearance of the inhabitants le&s;s national and characteri&s;tic than el&s;ewhere. There are few per&s;ons in the &s;treets, who, without their orange cockades, might not be mi&s;taken for Engli&s;h; but ribbons of this colour are almo&s;t univer&s;al, which &s;ome wear in their hats, and &s;ome upon a button-hole of the coat. The poore&s;t per&s;ons, and there are more poor here than el&s;ewhere, find &s;omething orange-coloured to &s;hew. Chil|dren have it placed upon their caps; &s;o that the practice is carried to an extent as ridiculous, as the prohibition was in 1785, when the ma|gi&s;trates ordered, that <HI>nothing orange-coloured &s;hould be worn, or &s;hewn, not even fruits, or flowers, and that carrots &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to &s;ale with the ends outwards.</HI></P>
<P>The di&s;tinctions between political cla&s;&s;es are very &s;trongly marked and pre&s;erved in Holland. We were informed, that there are &s;ome villages, in which the wearing of a cockade, and others, in which the want of one, would expo&s;e a pa&s;&s;enger, e&s;pecially a native, to in|&s;ults. In the cities, where tho&s;e of both parties mu&s;t tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s together, the di&s;tinction is not much ob&s;erved. In Am&s;terdam, the friends of the Stadtholder do not wear cockades. For the mo&s;t part, the &s;eamen, farmers and labouring cla&s;&s;es in the towns are attached to the Orange family, who&s;e opponents are chiefly compo&s;ed of the opulent merchants and trade&s;men.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49">
A hi&s;tory, or even a de&s;cription of the two parties, if we were enabled to give it, would occupy too much &s;pace here; but it may be &s;hortly mentioned, that the original, or chief cau&s;e of the di&s;&s;en&s;ion was, as might be expected, entirely of a commercial nature. The Eng|li&s;h intere&s;t had an unanimous popularity in Holland, about the year 1750. In the war of 1756, the French, having &s;u&s;tained a great lo&s;s of &s;hipping, employed Dutch ve&s;&s;els to bring the produce of their American i&s;lands to Europe, and thus e&s;tabli&s;hed a con&s;iderable con|nection with the merchants of Am&s;terdam and Rotterdam. The Court of Ver&s;ailles took care, that the &s;tream of French wealth, which they &s;aw &s;etting into the United Provinces, &s;hould carry with it &s;ome French politics; while the wealth it&s;elf effected more than all their contrivance, and gradually produced a kindne&s;s for France, e&s;pecially in the province of Holland, through which it chiefly circulated. The Engli&s;h Mini&s;ters took all Dutch &s;hips, having French property on board; and the popularity of England was for a time de&s;troyed. Se|veral maritime towns, probably with &s;ome in&s;tigation from France, demanded a war again&s;t England. The friends of the Stadtholder prevented this; and from that time the Prince began to &s;hare what|ever unpopularity the mea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h Mini&s;ters, or the in|du&s;try of the Engli&s;h traders, could excite in a rival and a commercial country.</P>
<P>The capture of the French We&s;t India i&s;lands &s;oon after removed the cau&s;e of the di&s;pute; but the effects of it &s;urvived in the jealou&s;y of the great cities towards the Stadtholder, and were much aggravated
<PB N="42" REF="50">
by the lo&s;&s;es of their merchants, at the commencement of ho&s;tilities be|tween England and the United Provinces, in 1780. The Dutch fleet being then unprepared to &s;ail, and every thing, which could float, having been &s;ent out of the harbours of York&s;hire and Lincoln|&s;hire to intercept their trading &s;hips, the fortunes of many of the mo&s;t opulent hou&s;es in Holland were &s;everely &s;hook, and all their mem|bers became the enemies of the Stadtholder.</P>
<P>If to the&s;e circum&s;tances it is added, that the province of Holland, which pays fifty-eight parts of every hundred, levied by taxes, has an ambition for acquiring greater influence in the general government, than is be&s;towed by its &s;ingle vote, we have probably all the original cau&s;es of the party di&s;tinctions in Holland, though others may have been incorporated with others, during a long &s;eries of events and many violent &s;truggles of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Stadtholder, who has had the misfortune to attract &s;o much attention by his difficulties, is &s;aid to be a man of plain manners and &s;ound under&s;tanding, neither capable of political intrigue, nor inclined to it. His office requires, e&s;pecially during a war, a great deal of &s;ub&s;tantial, per&s;onal labour, to which he devotes him&s;elf earne&s;tly and continually, but which he has not the vigour to bear, without an evi|dent oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits. We &s;aw him at a parade of the Guards, and it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be told of his labours to perceive how much he is affected by them. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to conceive a countenance more expre&s;&s;ive of a mind, always urged, always pre&s;&s;ed upon, and not often receiving the relief of complete confidence in its efforts.
<PB N="43" REF="51">
His per&s;on is &s;hort and extremely corpulent; his air in conver&s;ation mode&s;t and mild. This attendance upon the parade is his chief exerci&s;e, or relaxation at the Hague, where he frequently pa&s;&s;es ten of the hours between five in a morning and nine at night in his cabi|net. He comes, accompanied by one or two officers, and his pre|&s;ence produces no crowd. When we had viewed the parade and re|turned home, we &s;aw him walking under our windows towards the <HI>Voorhout,</HI> accompanied by an officer, but not followed by a &s;ingle per&s;on.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ation does not turn &s;o much upon the family of the Stadt|holder, as that we could acquire any di&s;tinct opinions of the other parts of it. Of his humanity and temper, there was &s;ufficient proof, in 1787, when he returned to the Hague and was ma&s;ter of the per|&s;ons of tho&s;e, who had lately bani&s;hed him. Indeed, the conduct of both parties, with re&s;pect to the per&s;onal &s;afety of their adver&s;aries, was honourable to the character of the nation. The States of Hol|land, during the prevalence of their authority, did not pretend, ac|cording to the inju&s;tice of &s;imilar ca&s;es, to any right of de&s;troying the friends of the Stadtholder, who were in their hands; the Stadtholder, when he returned, and when the public dete&s;tation of his adver&s;aries was at an height, which would have permitted any mea&s;ures again&s;t them, demanded no other retribution, than that &s;eventeen, named in a lift, &s;hould be declared incapable of holding offices under the Re|public.</P>
<P>One of the be&s;t excur&s;ions from the Hague is made to the <HI>Mai&s;on</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="52">
<HI>du Bois,</HI> a &s;mall palace of the Prince of ORANGE, in a wood, which commences almo&s;t at the northern gate of the town. This wood is called a park, but it is open to the public roads from Leyden, Haer|lem and Am&s;terdam, which pa&s;s through its noble alleys of oak and beech. It is remarkable for having &s;o much attracted the re|gard of Philip the Second, that, in the campaign of 1574, he or|dered his officers not to de&s;troy it; and is probably the only thing, not de&s;tined for him&s;elf, of which this ample de&s;troyer of human kind and of his own family ever directed the pre&s;ervation. LOUIS the FOURTEENTH, probably having heard the prai&s;es of this care, left the mall of Utrecht to be a monument of &s;imilar tenderne&s;s, dur|ing an unprovoked inva&s;ion, which co&s;t ten thou&s;and lives.</P>
<P>The apartments of the <HI>Mai&s;on du Bois</HI> are very variou&s;ly fur|ni&s;hed. The be&s;t are fitted up with a light grey &s;attin, imbo&s;&s;ed with Chine&s;e birds and plants, in &s;ilk and feathers of the mo&s;t beautiful tints; the window curtains, &s;creens and coverings of the &s;ophas and chairs are the &s;ame, and the frames of the latter are al&s;o of Chine&s;e workman&s;hip. Nothing more delicate and ta&s;teful can be conceived; but, that you may not be quite di&s;tracted with admira|tion, the carpets are &s;uch as an Engli&s;h merchant would &s;carcely receive into a parlour. The furniture of the &s;tate bed-chamber is valuable, and has once been &s;plendid; a light balu&s;trade of curious Japan work, about three feet high, runs acro&s;s the room, and di|vides that part, in which the bed &s;tands, from the remainder. The Prince&s;s's drawing-room, in which card parties are &s;ometimes
<PB N="45" REF="53">
held, is well embelli&s;hed with paintings, and may be called a &s;u|perb apartment; but here again there is an in&s;tance of the incom|pletene&s;s, &s;aid to be ob&s;ervable in the furniture of all rooms, out of England. Of four card tables two are odd ones, and literally would be de&s;pi&s;ed in a broker's &s;hop in London. The great glory of the hou&s;e is the <HI>Salle d'Orange,</HI> an oblong &s;aloon of noble height, with pannels, painted by nine celebrated painters of the Flemi&s;h and Dutch &s;chools, among whom VAN TULDEN, a pupil of RUBENS, has ob&s;erved his manner &s;o much in a work&s;hop of Vulcan and in a figure of Venus forming a trophy, that they have been u&s;ually at|tributed to his ma&s;ter. The &s;ubjects on the pannels and ceiling are all allegorical, and complimentary, for the mo&s;t part, to the Princes of the Hou&s;e of Orange, e&s;pecially to FREDERIC HENRY, the &s;on of the fir&s;t WILLIAM and the grand&s;on of the Admiral COLIGNY. It was at the expence of his widow, that the hou&s;e was built and the &s;aloon thus ornamented.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the rooms are decorated with family portraits, of which &s;ome have ju&s;t been contributed by the pencil of the Hereditary Prince&s;s. A large piece repre&s;ents her&s;elf, taking a likene&s;s of the Prince&s;s her mother-in-law, and includes what is &s;aid to be an ad|mirable portrait of her hu&s;band. On the &s;ix doors of the grand cabinet are &s;ix whole lengths of ladies of the Hou&s;e of Orange, ex|hibited in allegorical characters. The doors being covered by the paintings, when that, by which you have entered, is &s;hut, you can|not tell the way back again. A portrait of LOUISA DE COLIGNY,
<PB N="46" REF="54">
the widow of William the Fir&s;t, is enriched with a painter's pun; &s;he is pre&s;ented by <HI>Hope</HI> with a branch of an <HI>orange</HI> tree, contain|ing only <HI>one</HI> orange; from which the &s;pectator is to learn, that her <HI>&s;on</HI> was her <HI>only hope.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t delightful outlet from the Hague is towards Schevening, a village on the &s;ea-&s;hore, nearly two miles di&s;tant, the road to which has been often and properly celebrated as a noble monument of ta&s;teful grandeur. Commencing at the canal, which &s;urrounds the Hague, it proceeds to the village through a vi&s;ta &s;o exactly &s;traight, that the &s;teeple of Schevening, the central object at the end of it, is vi&s;ible at the fir&s;t entrance. Four rows of lofty elms are planted along the road, of which the two central lines form this perfect and mo&s;t picture&s;que vi&s;ta; the others &s;helter paths on each &s;ide of it, for foot pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The village it&s;elf, containing two or three hundred hou&s;es of fi&s;her|men and pea&s;ants, would be a &s;pectacle, for its neatne&s;s, any where but in Holland. There is no &s;quare, or &s;treet of the mo&s;t magnificent hou&s;es in London, that can equal it for an univer&s;al appearance of fre&s;hne&s;s. It is po&s;itively bright with cleanline&s;s; though its only &s;treet opens upon the &s;ea, and is the re&s;ort of hundreds of fi&s;her|men. We pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t delightful day at a little inn upon the beach, &s;ometimes looking into the hi&s;tory of the village, which is very antient; then enquiring into its pre&s;ent condition; and then enjoy|ing the pro&s;pect of the ocean, boundle&s;s to our view, on one &s;ide, and appearing to be but feebly re&s;trained by a long tract of low white coa&s;t on the other.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55">
The &s;ea beats furiou&s;ly upon the beach here, which has no doubt been much rai&s;ed by art for the defence of the village. There is at lea&s;t no other way of accounting for its &s;ecurity, &s;ince 1574, be|tween which year and the latter end of the preceding century, it &s;u&s;|tained &s;ix inundations. The fir&s;t, in 1470, demoli&s;hed a church; the la&s;t wa&s;hed away an hundred and twenty hou&s;es; notwith&s;tand|ing which, the inhabitants built again upon their &s;tormy &s;hore; and their indu&s;try, that, at length, protected them from the &s;ea, enabled them to endure al&s;o the more inveterate ravages of the Spaniards. On this beach lie occa&s;ionally great numbers of herring bu&s;&s;es, too &s;toutly built to be injured by touching it. We &s;u&s;pect our information to have been exaggerated; but we heard on the &s;pot, that no le&s;s than one hundred and five belong to this village of little more than two hundred hou&s;es, or are managed by agents in it. About forty were &s;et on float by the tide in the afternoon, and, being hauled by means of anchors beyond a very heavy &s;urf, were out of &s;ight, before we left the place.</P>
<P>It was amu&s;ing to &s;ee the per&s;evering, effectual, but not very ac|tive exertions of the &s;eamen in this bu&s;ine&s;s, which could not often be more difficult than it then was, when a &s;trong wind blew directly upon the &s;hore. We here fir&s;t perceived, what we had many other opportunities of ob&s;erving, that, notwith&s;tanding the general admira|tion of Dutch indu&s;try, it is of a nature which would &s;carcely acquire that name in England. A Dutchman of the labouring cla&s;s is, in|deed, &s;eldom &s;een unemployed; but we never ob&s;erved one man
<PB N="48" REF="56">
working hard, according to the Engli&s;h notion of the term. Per&s;ever|ance, carefulne&s;s, and &s;teadine&s;s are theirs, beyond any rival&s;hip; the vehemence, force, activity and impatience of an Engli&s;h &s;ailor, or work|man, are unknown to them. You will never &s;ee a Dutchman en|during the fatigue, or enjoying the re&s;t, of a London porter. Heavy burthens, indeed, they do not carry. At Am&s;terdam, where car|riages are even &s;omewhat obnoxious, a ca&s;k, holding four or five gallons of liquor, is removed by a hor&s;e and a &s;ledge.</P>
<P>On our way from Schevening, where a dinner co&s;ts more than at an hotel in the Hague, we turned a little to the right to &s;ee Portland Gardens, once the favourite re&s;ort of William and Mary; and &s;aid to be laid out in the Engli&s;h ta&s;te. They are now a bad &s;pecimen even of Dutch gardens. The &s;ituation is unu&s;ually low, having on one hand the rai&s;ed bank of the Schevening road, and, on another, the &s;and hills of the coa&s;t. Between the&s;e, the moi&s;ture of the &s;ea air is held for a long time, and finally drawn down upon the earth. The artificial ornaments are &s;tained and decaying; and the gra&s;s and weeds of the neglected plots are capable only of a putrid green. Over walks of a black mould you are led to the orangery, where there is more decay, and may look through the windows of the green-hou&s;e, to perceive how every thing is declining there. Some pavilions, provided with water &s;pouts, are then to be &s;een; and, if you have the patience to wait the conclu&s;ion of an operation, intended to &s;urpri&s;e you, you may count how many of the pipes refu&s;e to perform their office.</P>
<P>Nearer to the Hague, we were &s;topped to pay a toll of a few

doights; a circum&s;tance which was attended with this proof of civility. Having pa&s;&s;ed in the morning, without the demand, we enquired why it &s;hould be made now. The gatherer replied, that he had &s;een us pa&s;s, but, knowing that we mu&s;t return by the &s;ame way, had avoided giving more trouble than was nece&s;&s;ary. This tax is paid for the &s;upport of the bank, or digue, over which the road pa&s;&s;es; a work, begun on the 1&s;t of May 1664, and fini&s;hed on the 5th of December 1665, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a loan granted for the enterpri&s;e. The breadth of the road is thirty-two yards.</P>
<P>The next day, after &s;eeing the relief of the Stadtholder's <HI>garde du corps,</HI> the privates of which wear feathered hats, with uniforms of &s;carlet and gold, we left the Hague, with much admiration of its plea&s;antne&s;s and quiet grandeur, and took the <HI>roof</HI> of the trecht|&s;chuyt for Leyden.</P>

<P>THREE hours plea&s;ant floating along a canal, adorned with frequent country hou&s;es, gardens, &s;ummer-hou&s;es and &s;quare balconies, or rather platforms, projecting over the water, within an hand's breadth of its level, brought us to this city, which was e&s;teemed the &s;econd in Holland, before Rotterdam gained its pre&s;ent extent. Leyden is, however, &s;o large, that a traveller is likely to have a walk of half a league to his inn; and tho&s;e who arrive, as we did, at the time of the fair, may find the proce&s;&s;ion not very plea&s;ant. We increa&s;ed our difficulties by turning away from the dirt and in|civility of what was called the be&s;t inn, and did not afterwards find a better, though &s;uch, it &s;eems, might have been had.</P>
<P>Having, at length, become contented with the wor&s;t, we went to|wards the fair, of which we had as yet &s;een only the crowd. The booths, being di&s;po&s;ed under trees and along the borders of canals, made the whole appearance differ from that of an Engli&s;h fair, though not quite &s;o much as we had expected. The &s;tock of the &s;hopkeepers makes a greater di&s;tinction. There were &s;everal booths filled with &s;ilver&s;miths' and jewellers' wares, to the amount of, probably, &s;ome thou&s;and pounds each. Large French clocks in <HI>or moulu</HI> and por|celain
<PB N="51" REF="59">
were among their &s;tores. All the trades di&s;played the mo&s;t valuable articles, that could be a&s;ked for in &s;imilar &s;hops in large cities. We had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee great quantities of Engli&s;h goods, and there were Engli&s;h names over three, or four of the booths.</P>
<P>The Dutch dre&s;&s;es were now become &s;o familiar to us, that the crowd &s;eemed as remarkable for the number of other per&s;ons in it, as for the abundance of pea&s;ants in their holiday finery, which, it is plea&s;ant to know, di&s;plays the ornamental relics of &s;everal generations, fa&s;hion having very little influence in Holland. The fair occupied about a fourth part of the town, which we &s;oon left to &s;ee the remainder. Two &s;treets, parallel to each other, run through its whole length, and include the few public halls of an Univer&s;ity, which would &s;carcely be known to exi&s;t, if it had no more con&s;picuous objects than its buildings. The Dutch univer&s;ities contain no endowed foun|dations; &s;o that the profe&s;&s;ors, who have their &s;alaries from the States, live in private hou&s;es, and the &s;tudents in lodgings. The academical dre&s;s is worn only in the &s;chools, and by the profe&s;&s;ors. The library, to which Jo&s;eph Scaliger was a benefactor, is open only once in a week, and then for no more than two hours. It is the con&s;tant policy of the Dutch government, to make &s;trangers leave as much money as po&s;&s;ible behind them; and Leyden was once &s;o greatly the re&s;ort of foreigners, that it was thought important not to let them read for nothing what they mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be obliged to buy. The Univer&s;ity is, of cour&s;e, declining much, under this commercial wi&s;|dom of the magi&s;trates.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="60">
There are &s;tudents, however, of many nations and religions, no oaths being impo&s;ed, except upon the profe&s;&s;ors. Phy&s;ic and botany e&s;pecially are &s;aid to be cultivated here with much &s;ucce&s;s; and there is a garden, to which not only individuals, but the Ea&s;t India Com|pany, indu&s;triou&s;ly contribute foreign plants. The &s;alaries of the profe&s;&s;ors, who receive, be&s;ides, fees from the &s;tudents, are nearly two hundred pounds a-year. The government of the Univer&s;ity is in the rector, who is cho&s;en out of three per&s;ons returned by the Senate to the States; the Senate con&s;i&s;ts of the profe&s;&s;ors; and, on extraordi|nary occa&s;ions, the Senate and Rector are directed by Curators, who are the agents for the States.</P>
<P>The chief &s;treet in the town is of the cre&s;cent form, &s;o that, with more public buildings, it would be a miniature re&s;emblance of High|&s;treet, Oxford. The town-hou&s;e is built with many &s;pires, and with almo&s;t Chine&s;e lightne&s;s. We did not &s;ee the interior of this, or, indeed, of any other public buildings; for, in the morning, when curio&s;ity was to be indulged, our fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s as to the inns returned, and induced us to take a pa&s;&s;age for Haerlem. The MSS. of the Dutch ver&s;ion of the Bible, which are known to be depo&s;ited here, could not have been &s;hewn, being opened only once in three years, when the Deputies of the Synod and States attend; but we might have &s;een, in the town-hou&s;e, &s;ome curious te&s;timonies of the hard|&s;hips and per&s;everance of the inhabitants, during the celebrated blockade of five months, in 1574, in con&s;ideration of which the Uni|ver&s;ity was founded.</P>

<P>THE canal between Leyden and this place is nearly the plea|&s;ante&s;t of the great number, which connect all the towns of the pro|vince with each other, and render them to the traveller a &s;eries of &s;pec|tacles, almo&s;t as ea&s;ily vi&s;ited as the amu&s;ements of one large metropo|lis. Though this is &s;aid to be one of the lowe&s;t parts of Holland, the country does not appear to have &s;uffered more than the re&s;t by water. The many country &s;eats, which border the canals, are al&s;o proofs that it is thought to be well &s;ecured; yet this is the di&s;trict, which has been proved, by indi&s;putable ob&s;ervations, to be lower than the neighbour|ing &s;ea, even in the profounde&s;t calm. During the voyage, which was of four hours, we pa&s;&s;ed under &s;everal bridges, and &s;aw num|bers of &s;maller canals, cro&s;&s;ing the country in various directions; but the pa&s;&s;age of a trecht&s;chuyt is not delayed for an in&s;tant by a bridge, the tow-rope being loo&s;ened from the boat, on one &s;ide, and imme|diately caught again, on the other, if it &s;hould not be delivered by &s;ome per&s;on, purpo&s;ely &s;tationed on the arch. It is not often that a
<PB N="54" REF="62">
canal makes any bend in its cour&s;e; when it does &s;o, there are &s;mall, high po&s;ts at the point, round which the tow-rope is drawn; and, that the cord may not be de&s;troyed by the friction, the po&s;ts &s;upport perpendicular rollers, which are turned by its motion. Such po&s;ts and rollers might be advantageou&s;ly brought into u&s;e in England. On mo&s;t of the canals are half-way villages, where pa&s;&s;engers may &s;top, about five minutes, for refre&s;hment; but they will be left be|hind, without any ceremony, if they exceed the limited time, which the boatman employs in exchanging letters for &s;uch of the neigh|bouring country hou&s;es as have not packet boxes placed on the banks.</P>
<P>Haerlem, like Leyden, is forti&s;ied by brick walls, but both &s;eem to be without the &s;olid earthern works, that con&s;titute the &s;trength of modern fortre&s;&s;es. A few pieces of cannon are planted near the gate, in order to command the bridge of a wide <HI>fo&s;&s;&eacute;;</HI> and the gate-hou&s;e it&s;elf is a &s;tout building, deep enough to render the pa&s;&s;age under|neath &s;omewhat dark. There is otherwi&s;e very little appearance of the &s;trength, that re&s;i&s;ted the Duke of Alva, for twelve months, and exa&s;perated his de&s;ire of vengeance &s;o far, that the murder of the in|habitants, who at la&s;t &s;urrendered to his promi&s;es of protection, could alone appea&s;e it.</P>
<P>A narrow &s;treet leads from the gate to the market-place, where two pieces of cannon are planted before the guard-hou&s;e; the fir&s;t pre|caution again&s;t internal commotion, which we had &s;een in the coun|try. Haerlem had a great &s;hare in the di&s;putes of 1787, and is &s;aid to adhere more fully than any other city to the Anti-Stadtholderian politics of that period.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63">
The market-place is very &s;pacious, and &s;urrounds the great church, perhaps, the large&s;t &s;acred building in the province of Holland. The lofty oak roof is marked with dates of the early part of the &s;ixteenth century. The organ, &s;ometimes &s;aid to be the be&s;t in Europe, is of unu&s;ual &s;ize, but has more power of &s;ound than &s;weetne&s;s. The pipes are &s;ilvered, and the body carefully painted; for organs are the only objects in Dutch churches, which are permitted to be &s;hewy. They are now building, in the great church at Rotterdam, a rival to this in&s;trument, and need not de&s;pair of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>A great part of the congregation &s;it upon chairs in the large ai&s;le, which does not &s;eem to be thought a much inferior place to the other parts. During an evening &s;ervice, at which we were pre&s;ent, this was nearly filled; and while every per&s;on took a &s;eparate &s;eat, women carried <HI>chauffepieds,</HI> or little wooden boxes, with pans of burning peat in them, to the ladies. This was on the 4th of June. The men enter the church with their hats on, and &s;ome wear them, during the whole &s;ervice, with the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting and arrogant hardihood.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed a night at Haerlem, which is &s;carcely worth &s;o long a &s;tay, though one &s;treet, formed upon the banks of a canal, con&s;i&s;ts of hou&s;es more uniformly grand, than any out of the Hague, and &s;urpri&s;es you with its exten&s;ive magnificence at a place, where there is little other appearance of wealth and none of &s;plendour. But the quietne&s;s of the Great in Holland is daily a&s;toni&s;hing to a &s;tranger, who &s;ome|times pa&s;&s;es through rows of palaces, without meeting a carriage, or a &s;ervant. The inhabitants of tho&s;e palaces have, however, not le&s;s
<PB N="56" REF="64">
earne&s;t views, than they who are more agitated; the difference between them is, that the views of the former are only &s;uch as their &s;ituation enables them to gratify, without the agitation of the latter. They can &s;it &s;till and wait for the conclu&s;ion of every year, at which they are to be richer, or rather are to have much more money, than in the pre|ceding one. They know, that, every day the &s;ilent progre&s;s of intere&s;t adds &s;o much to their principal; and they are content to watch the cour&s;e of time, for it is time alone that varies their wealth, the &s;ingle object of their attention. There can be no motive, but its truth, for repeating the trite opinion of the influence of avarice in Hol|land: we expected, perhaps, with &s;ome vanity, to have found an op|portunity for contradicting it; but are able only to add another te&s;ti|mony of its truth. The infatuation of loving money not as a means, but as an end, is paramount in the mind of almo&s;t every Dutchman, whatever may be his other di&s;po&s;itions and qualities; the addiction to it is fervent, inveterate, invincible, and univer&s;al from youth to the feeble&s;t old age.</P>
<P>Haerlem has little trade, its communication with the &s;ea being through Am&s;terdam, which latter place has always been able to ob|&s;truct the rea&s;onable &s;cheme of cutting a canal through the four miles of land, that &s;eparate the former from the ocean. Its manufactures of &s;ilk and thread are much le&s;s pro&s;perous than formerly. Yet there are no &s;ymptoms of decay, or poverty, and the environs are well co|vered with gardens e&s;pecially on the banks of the <HI>Sparen,</HI> of which one branch flows through the town and the other pa&s;&s;es under the walls.

<P>THE voyage between Haerlem and this place is le&s;s plea|&s;ant, with re&s;pect to the country, than many of the other trips, but more gratifying to curio&s;ity. For great part of the way, the canal pa&s;&s;es between the lake, called <HI>Haerlemer Maer,</HI> and a large branch of the <HI>Zuyder Zee,</HI> called the River Y. In one place, the neck of land, which &s;eparates the&s;e two waters, is &s;o thin, that a canal cannot be drawn through it; and, near this, there is a village, where pa&s;&s;engers leave their fir&s;t boat, another waiting for them at the renewal of the canal, within a quarter of a mile. Here, as upon other occa&s;ions of
<PB N="58" REF="66">
the &s;ame &s;ort, nearly as much is paid for the carriage of two or three trunks between the boats, as for the whole voyage; and there is an <HI>Ordonnatie</HI> to authorize the price; for the Magi&s;trates have con&s;idered, that tho&s;e, who have much baggage, are probably foreigners, and may be thus made to &s;upport many of the natives. The Dutch them|&s;elves put their linen into a velvet bag, called a <HI>Ry&s;ack,</HI> and for this accordingly no charge is made.</P>
<P>The <HI>Half Wegen Sluice</HI> is the name of this &s;eparation between two va&s;t waters, both of which have gained con&s;iderably upon their &s;hores, and, if united, would be irre&s;i&s;tible. At the narrowe&s;t part, it con|&s;i&s;ts of pile-work and ma&s;onry, to the thickne&s;s of probably forty feet. On this &s;pot the &s;pectator has, on his left hand, the Y, which, though called a river, is an immen&s;e inundation of the Zuyder Zee, and would probably carry a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, without interruption, into the German ocean. On the other hand, is the Haerlem lake, about twelve miles long and nine broad, on which, during the &s;iege of Haerlem, the Dutch and Spaniards maintained fleets, and fought battles. Extend|ing as far as Leyden, there is a pa&s;&s;age upon it from that city to Am&s;terdam, much &s;horter than by the canal, but held to be dan|gerous. Before the year 1657, there was, however, no other way, and it was probably the lo&s;s of the Prince of Bohemia and the danger of his dethroned father upon the lake, that in&s;tigated the making of the canal.</P>
<P>This &s;luice is one of &s;everal valuable po&s;ts, by which Am&s;terdam may be defended again&s;t a powerful army, and was an important
<PB N="59" REF="67">
&s;tation, during the approach of the Duke of BRUNSWICK in 1787, when this city was the la&s;t, which &s;urrendered. All the roads being formed upon dikes, or embankments, may be defended by batteries, which can be attacked only by narrow columns and in front. The Half Wegen Sluice was, however, ea&s;ily taken by the Duke of BRUNSWICK, his opponents having neglected to place gun-boats on the Haerlem lake, over which he carried eight hundred men in thirty boats, and &s;urpri&s;ed the Dutch before day-break, on the morning of the fir&s;t of October. This was one of his real a&s;&s;aults, but there were all together eleven made on that day, and, on the next, the city propo&s;ed to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>Beyond the &s;luice, the canal pa&s;&s;es &s;everal breaches, made by inun|dations of the Y, and not capable of being drained, or repaired. In the&s;e places the canal is &s;eparated from the inundations either by piles, or floating planks. None of the breaches were made within the memory of the pre&s;ent generation, yet the boatmen have learned to &s;peak of them with horror.</P>
<P>There is nothing magnificent, or grand, in the approach to Am|&s;terdam, or the pro&s;pect of the city. The &s;ails of above an hundred windmills, moving on all &s;ides, &s;eem more con&s;picuous than the public buildings of this celebrated capital.</P>
<P>The trecht&s;chuyt having &s;topped on the out&s;ide of the gate, we waited for one of the public coaches, which are always to be had by &s;ending to a livery &s;table, but do not &s;tand in the &s;treet for fares. It co&s;t half-a-crown for a drive of about two miles into the city; the
<PB N="60" REF="68">
regulated price is a guilder, or twenty-pence. Our direction was to the <HI>Doolen;</HI> but the driver cho&s;e to take us to another inn, in the &s;ame &s;treet, which we did not di&s;cover to be otherwi&s;e called, till we had become &s;atisfied with it.</P>
<P>Nearly all the chief thorough-fares of Am&s;terdam are narrow, but the carriages are neither &s;o numerous as in other places of the &s;ame &s;ize, nor &s;uffered to be driven with the &s;ame &s;peed; &s;o that, though there is no rai&s;ed pavement, foot pa&s;&s;engers are as &s;afe as el&s;ewhere. There are broad terraces to the &s;treets over the two chief canals, but the&s;e are &s;ometimes encumbered by work&s;hops, placed immediately over the water, between which and the hou&s;es the owners maintain an intercour&s;e of packages and planks, with very little care about the freedom of the pa&s;&s;age. This, indeed, may be con&s;tantly ob|&s;erved of the Dutch: they will never, either in their &s;ocieties, or their bu&s;ine&s;s, employ their time, for a moment, in gratifying the little malice, or &s;hewing the little envy, or a&s;&s;uming the little triumphs, which fill &s;o much of life with unnece&s;&s;ary mi&s;eries; but they will &s;eldom &s;tep one inch out of their way, or &s;urrender one moment of their time, to &s;ave tho&s;e, whom they do not know, from any incon|venience. A Dutchman, throwing chee&s;es into his warehou&s;e, or drawing iron along the pathway, will not &s;top, while a lady, or an infirm per&s;on pa&s;&s;es, unle&s;s he perceives &s;omebody inclined to pro|tect them; a warehou&s;eman trundling a ca&s;k, or a woman in the favourite occupation of throwing water upon her windows, will leave it entirely to the pa&s;&s;engers to take care of their limbs, or their clothes.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="69">
The canals them&s;elves, which are the ornaments of other Dutch cities, are, for the mo&s;t part, the nui&s;ances of Am&s;terdam. Many of them are entirely &s;tagnant, and, though deep, are &s;o laden with filth, that, on a hot day, the feculence &s;eems pe&s;tilential. Our win|dows opened upon two, but the &s;cent very &s;oon made us willing to relinqui&s;h the pro&s;pect. The bottoms are &s;o muddy, that a boat|hook, drawn up, perhaps, through twelve feet of water, leaves a circle of &s;lime at the top, which is not lo&s;t for many minutes. It is not unu&s;ual to &s;ee boats, laden with this mud, pa&s;&s;ing during mid|day, under the windows of the mo&s;t opulent traders; and the fetid cargoes never di&s;turb the inten&s;e &s;tudies of the counting-hou&s;es within.</P>
<P>After this di&s;ta&s;te of the &s;treets and canals of Am&s;terdam, it was a &s;ort of duty to &s;ee, what is the glory of the city, the interior of the Stadthou&s;e; but we lo&s;t this &s;pectacle, by a negligence of that &s;evere punctuality, in which the Dutch might be u&s;efully imitated throughout the world. Our friends had obtained for us a ticket of admi&s;&s;ion at ten; we called upon them about half an hour after|wards; but, as the ride from their hou&s;e would have required ten minutes more, the time of this ticket was thought to be elap&s;ed. We would not accept one, which was offered to be obtained for another day, being unwilling to render it po&s;&s;ible, that tho&s;e, who were loading us with the &s;incere&s;t civilities, &s;hould witne&s;s another apparent in&s;tance of inattention.</P>
<P>The Stadthou&s;e, as to its exterior, is a plain &s;tone building, at|tracting
<PB N="62" REF="70">
attention chiefly from its length, &s;olidity and height. The front is an hundred and eight paces long. It has no large gate, but &s;everal &s;mall ones, and few &s;tatues, that would be ob&s;erved, ex|cept one of Atlas on the top. The tales, as to the expence of the building, are inexhau&s;tible. The foundation alone, which is entirely of piles, is &s;aid to have co&s;t a million of guilders, or nearly ninety thou&s;and pounds, and the whole edifice treble that &s;um. Its contents, the &s;tock of the celebrated Bank, are e&s;timated at various amounts, of which we will not repeat the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>The Exchange is an humble building, and not convenient of acce&s;s. The Po&s;t Office is well &s;ituated, upon a broad terrace, near the Stadt|hou&s;e, and &s;eems to be properly laid out for its u&s;e.</P>
<P>None of the churches are con&s;picuous for their &s;tructure; but the regulation, with re&s;pect to their mini&s;ters, &s;hould be more known. Two are a&s;&s;igned to each, and all throughout the city have equal and re&s;pectable &s;alaries.</P>
<P>At a di&s;tance from the Exchange are &s;ome magnificent &s;treets, rai&s;ed on the banks of canals, nearly equalling tho&s;e of the Hague for the grandeur of hou&s;es, and much exceeding in length the be&s;t of Leyden and Haerlem. The&s;e are the &s;treets, which mu&s;t give a &s;tranger an opinion of the wealth of the city, while the Port, and that alone, can di&s;play the exten&s;ivene&s;s of its commerce. The &s;hops and the preparations for traffic in the interior have a mean appearance to tho&s;e, who try them by the &s;tandard of London con|veniences and elegance.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="71">
The be&s;t method of &s;eeing the Port is to pa&s;s down it in a boat to &s;ome of the many towns, that &s;kirt the Zuyder Zee. One conve|nience, ea&s;y to be had every where, is immediately vi&s;ible from the quays. Small platforms of planks &s;upported by piles project from the &s;hore between the ve&s;&s;els, which are di&s;po&s;ed with their heads towards the &s;ides of the&s;e little bridges; the furthe&s;t has thus a communication with the quay, and, if the cargo is not of very heavy articles, may be unladen at the &s;ame time with the others. The port is &s;o wide, that, though both &s;ides are thronged with &s;hipping, the channel in the middle is, at lea&s;t, as broad as the Thames at London Bridge; but the harbour does not extend to more than half the length of the <HI>Pool</HI> at London, and &s;eems to con|tain about half the number of ve&s;&s;els. The form of the port is, however, much more advantageous for a di&s;play of &s;hipping, which may be here &s;een nearly at one glance in a fine bay of the <HI>Zuyder.</HI></P>
<P>After a &s;ail of about an hour, we landed at Saardam, a village celebrated for the Dockyards, which &s;upply Am&s;terdam with nearly all its fleets. A &s;hort channel carries ve&s;&s;els of the greate&s;t burthen from Saardam to the Zuyder Zee, which the founders of the place took care not to approach too nearly; and the terrace at the end of this channel is prepared for the reception of cannon, that mu&s;t ea&s;ily defend it from any attack by &s;ea. Though the neigh|bourhood of a dockyard might be &s;uppo&s;ed a &s;ufficient antidote to cleanline&s;s, the neatne&s;s of this little town renders it a &s;pectacle even to the Dutch them&s;elves. The &s;treets are &s;o carefully &s;wept,

<P>We were &s;hewn nearly round the place, and, of cour&s;e, to the cottage, in which the indefatigable Peter the Fir&s;t of Ru&s;&s;ia re&s;ided, when he was a workman in the dockyard. It is a tenement of two rooms, &s;tanding in a part of the village, &s;o very mean, that the alleys near it are not cleaner, than tho&s;e of other places. An old woman lives in the cottage, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by &s;hewing it to vi&s;itors, among&s;t whom have been the pre&s;ent Grand Duke and Duche&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; for the Court of Peter&s;burgh acknowledge it to have been the re&s;idence of Peter, and have &s;truck a medal in commemoration of &s;o truly honourable a palace. The old woman has received one of the&s;e medals from the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, together with a grant of a &s;mall annuity to encourage her care of the cottage.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed an agreeable afternoon, at an inn on the terrace, from whence plea&s;ure ve&s;&s;els and pa&s;&s;age boats were continually departing for Am&s;terdam, and had a &s;mart &s;ail, on our return, during a cloudy and &s;omewhat a &s;tormy &s;un&s;et. The approach to Am&s;terdam, on this &s;ide, is as grand as that from Haerlem is mean, half the circuit of the city, and all its &s;pires, being vi&s;ible at once over the crowded har|bour. The great church of Haerlem is al&s;o &s;een at a &s;mall di&s;tance, on the right.</P>

The Am&s;tel, a wide river, which flows through the city into the harbour, fills nearly all the canals, and is it&s;elf capable of receiving &s;hips of con&s;iderable burthen: one of the bridges over it, and a terrace beyond, are among the few plea&s;ant walks enjoyed by the inhabitants. The Admiralty, an immen&s;e building, in the interior of which is the dockyard, &s;tands on this terrace, or quay; and the Ea&s;t India Com|pany have their magazine here, in&s;tead of the interior of the city, where it would be benevolence to let its perfume counteract the noxiou&s;ne&s;s of the canals.</P>
<P>The government of Am&s;terdam is &s;aid to collect by taxes, rents and dues of various &s;orts, more than an Engli&s;h million and a half annually; and, though a great part of this &s;um is afterwards paid to the u&s;e of the whole Republic, the power of collecting and di&s;tributing it mu&s;t give con&s;iderable con&s;equence to the magi&s;trates. The Se|nate, which has this power, con&s;i&s;ts of thirty-&s;ix members, who re|tain their &s;eats during life, and were formerly cho&s;en by the whole body of burghers; but, about two centuries ago, this privilege was &s;urrendered to the Senate it&s;elf, who have ever &s;ince filled up the va|cancies in their number by a majority of their own voices. The <HI>Echevins,</HI> who form the court of ju&s;tice, are here cho&s;en by the burghers out of a double number, nominated by the Senate: in the other cities, the Stadtholder, and not the burghers, makes this choice.</P>
<P>It is obvious, that when the City Senates, which return the Pro|vincial States, and, through them, the States General, were them|&s;elves
<PB N="66" REF="74">
elected by the burghers, the legi&s;lature of the United Provinces had a character entirely repre&s;entative; and, at pre&s;ent, a re&s;pect for public opinion is &s;aid to have con&s;iderable influence in directing the choice of the Senates.</P>
<P>The province of Holland, of which this city is the mo&s;t important part, is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain 800,000 per&s;ons, who pay taxes to the amount of twenty-four millions of guilders, or two millions &s;terling, forming an average of two pounds ten &s;hillings per per&s;on. In e&s;ti|mating the real taxation of a people, it is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider the proportion of their con&s;umption to their imports; for the duties, advanced upon imported articles, are not ultimately and finally paid till the&s;e are con&s;umed. The frugal habits of the Dutch permit them to retain but a &s;mall part of the expen&s;ive commodities, which they collect; and the foreigners, to whom they are re&s;old, pay, there|fore, a large &s;hare of the taxation, which would be &s;o enormous, if it was confined to the inhabitants. Among the taxes, really paid by them&s;elves, are the following;&mdash;a land-tax of about four &s;hillings and nine pence per acre; a &s;ale-tax of eight per cent. upon hor&s;es, one and a quarter per cent. upon other moveables, and two and an half per cent. upon land and buildings; a tax upon inheritances out of the direct line, varying from two and an half to eleven per cent.; two per cent. upon every man's income; an exci&s;e of three pounds per hog&s;|head upon wine, and a charge of two per cent. upon all public offices. The latter tax is not quite &s;o popular here as in other countries, be|cau&s;e many of the&s;e offices are actually purcha&s;ed, the holders being
<PB N="67" REF="75">
compelled to buy &s;tock to a certain amount, and to de&s;troy the obliga|tions. The exci&s;e upon coffee, tea and &s;alt is paid annually by each family, according to the number of their &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Am&s;terdam, and &s;ome other cities, pay al&s;o a tax, in proportion to their property, for the maintenance of compa|nies of city-guards, which are under the orders of their own magi|&s;trates. In Am&s;terdam, indeed, taxation is &s;omewhat higher than in other places. Sir William Temple was a&s;&s;ured, that no le&s;s than thirty duties might be reckoned to have been paid there, before a cer|tain di&s;h could be placed upon a table at a tavern.</P>
<P>The exact &s;ums, paid by the &s;everal provinces towards every hun|dred thou&s;and guilders, rai&s;ed for the general u&s;e, have been often printed. The &s;hare of Holland is 58,309 guilders and a fraction; that of Over&s;&s;el, which is the &s;malle&s;t, 3571 guilders and a fraction.</P>
<P>Of five colleges of Admiralty, e&s;tabli&s;hed within the United Pro|vinces, three are in Holland, and contribute of cour&s;e to point out the pre-eminence of that province. It is remarkable, that neither of the&s;e &s;upply their &s;hips with provi&s;ions: They allow the captains to deduct about four-pence halfpenny per day from the pay of each &s;ailor for that purpo&s;e; a regulation, which is never made injurious to the &s;ea|men by any improper par&s;imony, and is &s;ometimes u&s;eful to the public, in a country where pre&s;&s;ing is not permitted. A captain, who has acquired a character for genero&s;ity among&s;t the &s;ailors, can mu&s;ter a crew in a few days, which, without &s;uch a temptation, could not be rai&s;ed in as many weeks.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="76">
We cannot &s;peak with exactne&s;s of the prices of provi&s;ions in this province, but they are generally &s;aid to be as high as in England. The charges at inns are the &s;ame as on the roads within an hundred miles of London, or, perhaps, &s;omething more. Port wine is not &s;o common as a wine which they call Claret, but which is compounded of a &s;trong red wine from Valencia, mixed with &s;ome from Bour|deaux. The general price for this is twenty pence Engli&s;h a bottle; three and four pence is the price for a much better &s;ort. About half|a-crown per day is charged for each apartment; and <HI>logement</HI> is al|ways the fir&s;t article in a bill.</P>
<P>Private families buy good claret at the rate of about eighteen pence per bottle, and chocolate for two &s;hillings per pound. Beef is &s;old for much le&s;s than in England, but is &s;o poor that the Dutch u&s;e it chiefly for &s;oup, and &s;alt even that which they roa&s;t. Good white &s;ugar is eighteen pence per pound. Bread is dearer than in England; and there is a &s;ort, called milk bread, of uncommon whitene&s;s, which co&s;ts nearly twice as much as our ordinary loaves. Herbs and fruits are much lower priced, and wor&s;e in flavour; but their colour and &s;ize are not inferior. Fi&s;h is cheaper than in our maritime counties, tho&s;e excepted which are at a great di&s;tance from the metropolis. Coffee is very cheap, and is more u&s;ed than tea. No kind of meat is &s;o good as in England; but veal is not much inferior, and is often dre&s;&s;ed as plainly and as well as with us. The innkeepers have a notion of mutton and lamb chops; but then it is <HI>&agrave; la Maintenon;</HI> and the rank oil of the paper is not a very delightful &s;auce. Butter is
<PB N="69" REF="77">
u&s;ually brought to table <HI>clarified,</HI> that is, purpo&s;ely melted into an <HI>oil;</HI> and it is difficult to make them under&s;tand that it may be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Dutch have much more re&s;pect for Engli&s;h than for other travellers; but there is a jealou&s;y, with re&s;pect to our commerce, which is avowed by tho&s;e, who have been tutored to calm di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and may be perceived in the conver&s;ation of others, whenever the &s;tate of the two countries is noticed. This jealou&s;y is greater in the maritime than in the other provinces, and in Am&s;terdam than in &s;ome of the other cities. Rotterdam has &s;o much direct intercour&s;e with England, as to feel, in &s;ome degree, a &s;hare in its intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Some of our excur&s;ions round Am&s;terdam were made in a curious vehicle; the body of a coach placed upon a &s;ledge, and drawn by one hor&s;e. The driver walks by the &s;ide, with the reins in one hand, and in the other a wetted rope, which he &s;ometimes throws under the &s;ledge to prevent it from taking fire, and to fill up the little gaps in the pavement. The appearance of the&s;e things was &s;o whim&s;ical, that curio&s;ity tempted us to embark in one; and, finding them laughed at by none but our&s;elves, the convenience of being upon a level with the &s;hops, and with the faces that &s;eemed to contain the hi&s;tory of the &s;hops, induced us to u&s;e them again. There are great numbers of them, being encouraged by the magi&s;trates, in preference to wheel carriages, and, as is &s;aid, in tenderne&s;s to the piled founda|tions of the city, the only one in Holland in which they are u&s;ed. The price is eight pence for any di&s;tance within the city, and eight pence an hour for attendance.</P>

Near Am&s;terdam is the &s;mall village of Ouderkirk, a place of &s;ome importance in the &s;hort campaign of 1787, being acce&s;&s;ible by four roads, all of which were then fortified. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of the country hou&s;es of Am&s;terdam merchants, at one of which we pa&s;&s;ed a plea&s;ant day. Having been but &s;lightly defended, after the lo&s;s of the po&s;ts of <HI>Half Wegen</HI> and <HI>Am&s;telreen,</HI> it was not much injured by the Pru&s;&s;ians; but there are many traces of balls thrown into it. The ride to it from Am&s;terdam is upon the chearful banks of the Am&s;tel, which is bordered, for more than five miles, with gardens of better verdure and richer groves than had hitherto appeared. The village was &s;pread with booths for a fair, though it was Sunday; and we were &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that a people in general &s;o gravely decorous as the Dutch, &s;hould not pay a &s;tricter deference to the Sabbath. We here took leave of &s;ome friends, who&s;e frank man|ners and obliging di&s;po&s;itions are remembered with much more de|light than any other circum&s;tances, relative to Am&s;terdam.</P>

<HEAD>UTRECHT.</HEAD>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age from Am&s;terdam hither is of eight hours; and, notwith&s;tanding the plea&s;antne&s;s of trecht&s;chuyt conveyance, &s;eemed &s;omewhat tedious, after the habit of pa&s;&s;ing from city to city in half that time. The canal is, however, ju&s;tly preferred to others, on account of the richne&s;s of its &s;urrounding &s;cenery; and it is plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve how gradually the country improves, as the di&s;|tance from the province of Holland and from the &s;ea increa&s;es. To|wards Utrecht, the gardens ri&s;e from the banks of the canal, in&s;tead of &s;preading below its level, and the grounds maintain avenues and plantations of lofty trees. Vegetation is &s;tronger and more copious; &s;hrubs ri&s;e to a greater height; meadows di&s;play a livelier green; and the lattice-work of the bowery avenues, which occur &s;o frequently, cea&s;es to be more con&s;picuous than the foliage.</P>
<P>It was Whit&s;untide, and the banks of the canal were gay with holiday people, riding in waggons and carts; the latter frequently carrying a woman wearing a painted hat as large as an umbrella, and a man with one in whim&s;ical contra&s;t clipped nearly clo&s;e to the crown. The lady &s;ometimes refre&s;hed her&s;elf with a fan, and the gentleman, meanwhile, with a pipe of tobacco. Every village we
<PB N="72" REF="80">
pa&s;&s;ed re&s;ounded with hoar&s;e mu&s;ic and the clatter of wooden &s;hoes: among the&s;e the prettie&s;t was <HI>Nieuver&s;luys,</HI> bordering each &s;ide of the canal, with a white drawbridge picture&s;quely &s;hadowed with high trees, and green banks &s;loping to the water's brim. Plea&s;ure-boats and trecht&s;chuyts lined the &s;hores; and the windows of every hou&s;e were thronged with broad faces. On the little terraces below were groups of &s;mokers, and of girls in the neat trim Dutch dre&s;s, with the fair complexion and air of decorous mode&s;ty, by which their country-women are di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>About half way from Am&s;terdam &s;tands a &s;mall modern fortifica|tion; and it is an in&s;tance of Dutch carefulne&s;s, that gra&s;s had ju&s;t been mowed even from the parapets of the batteries, and was made up in heaps within the works. Not far from it is an ancient ca&s;tle of one tower, left in the &s;tate to which it was reduced during the conte&s;t with the Spaniards.</P>
<P>Near Utrecht, the ground has improved &s;o much, that nothing but its evenne&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hes it from other countries; and, at &s;ome di&s;tance ea&s;tward, the hills of Guelderland ri&s;e to de&s;troy this la&s;t difference. The entrance into the city is between high terraces, from which &s;teps de&s;cend to the canal; but the &s;treet is not wide enough to have its appearance improved by this &s;ort of approach. Warehou&s;es, formed under the terraces, &s;hew al&s;o that the latter have been rai&s;ed more for convenience than &s;plendour.</P>
<P>The &s;teeple of the great church, formerly a cathedral, excites, in the mean time, an expectation of dignity in the interior, where &s;ome
<PB N="73" REF="81">
con&s;iderable &s;treets and another canal complete the air of an opulent city. It is not immediately &s;een, that a great part of the body of this cathedral has been de&s;troyed, and that the canals, being &s;ubject to tides, have dirty walls during the ebb. The &s;plendour, which might be expected in the capital of a province much inhabited by nobility, does not appear; nor is there, perhaps, any &s;treet equal to the be&s;t of Leyden and Haerlem; yet, in general beauty, the city is &s;uperior to either of the&s;e.</P>
<P>We arrived ju&s;t before nine, at which hour a bell rings to denote the &s;hutting of the larger gates; for the rules of a walled town are ob&s;erved here, though the fortifications could be of little other u&s;e than to prevent a &s;urpri&s;e by hor&s;e. The <HI>Chateau d'Anvers,</HI> at which we lodged, is an excellent inn, with a landlord, who tells, that he has walked &s;ixty years in his own pa&s;&s;age, and that he had the honour of entertaining the Marquis of Granby thirteen times, during the war of 1756. Though the Dutch inns are generally unobjection|able, there is an air of Engli&s;h completene&s;s about this which the others do not reach.</P>
<P>Utrecht is an univer&s;ity, but with as little appearance of &s;uch an in&s;titution as Leyden. The &s;tudents have no academical dre&s;s; and their halls, which are u&s;ed only for lectures and exerci&s;es, are formed in the cloi&s;ters of the ancient cathedral. The chief &s;ign of their re&s;idence in the place is, that the hou&s;eholders, who have lodgings to let, write upon a board, as is done at Leyden, <HI>Cubicula locanda.</HI> We were &s;hewn round the town by a member of the univer&s;ity, who carefully avoided the halls; and we did not pre&s;s to &s;ee them.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="82">
There are &s;till &s;ome traces remaining of the Bi&s;hopric, which was once &s;o powerful, as to excite the jealou&s;y, or rather, perhaps, to tempt the avarice of Charles the Fifth, who &s;eized upon many of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The u&s;e made of the remainder by the States General, is &s;carcely more ju&s;tifiable; for the prebends &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and are di&s;po&s;ed of by &s;ale to lay canons, who &s;end delegates to the Provincial States, as if they had eccle&s;ia&s;tical characters.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tantial remains of the Cathedral are one ai&s;le, in which divine &s;ervice is performed, and a lofty, magnificent Gothic tower, that &s;tands apart from it. The a&s;cent of this tower is one of the ta&s;ks pre&s;cribed to &s;trangers, and, laborious as it is, the view from the &s;ummit &s;ufficiently rewards them. A &s;tone &s;tairca&s;e, &s;teep, nar|row, and winding, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal grated doors, leads into a floor, which you hope is at the top, but which is little more than half way up. Here the family of the belfryman fill &s;everal decently furni&s;hed apartments, and &s;hew the great bell, with &s;everal others, the noi&s;e of which, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, no human ears could bear, as they mu&s;t, at the di&s;tance of only three, or four yards. After re&s;ting a few minutes in a room, the windows of which command, perhaps, a more exten&s;ive land view than any other inhabited apartment in Europe, you begin the &s;econd a&s;cent by a &s;tairca&s;e &s;till narrower and &s;teeper, and, when you &s;eem to be &s;o weary as to be incapable of another &s;tep, half the horizon &s;uddenly bur&s;ts upon the view, and all your meditated complaints are overborne by expre&s;&s;ions of admiration.</P>
<P>Towards the we&s;t, the pro&s;pect, after including the rich plain
<PB N="75" REF="83">
of gardens near Utrecht, extends over the province of Holland, inter&s;ected with water, &s;peckled with towns, and finally bounded by the &s;ea, the mi&s;ts of which hide the low &s;hores from the &s;ight. To the northward, the Zuyder Zee &s;preads its hazine&s;s over Am&s;terdam and Naerden; but from thence to the ea&s;t, the &s;pires of Amersfoort, Rhenen, Arnheim, Nimeguen and many intermediate towns, are &s;een among&s;t the woods and hills, that gradually ri&s;e towards Germany. Southward, the more mountainous di&s;trict of Cleves and then the level parts of Guelderland and Holland, with the windings of the Waal and the Leck, in which the Rhine lo&s;es it&s;elf, complete a circle of probably more than &s;ixty miles diameter, that &s;trains the &s;ight from this tremendous &s;teeple. The almo&s;t perpendicular view into the &s;treets of Utrecht affords afterwards &s;ome relief to the eye, but in|crea&s;es any notions of danger, you may have had from ob&s;erving, that the openwork Gothic parapet, which alone prevents you from falling with dizzine&s;s, has &s;uffered &s;omething in the general decay of the church.</P>
<P>While we were at the top, the bells &s;truck; and, between the gid|dine&s;s communicated by the eye, and the &s;tunning effect of a &s;ound that &s;eemed to &s;hake the &s;teeple, we were compelled to conclude &s;ooner than had been intended this comprehen&s;ive and farewell pro&s;pect of Holland.</P>
<P>The Mall, which is e&s;teemed the chief ornament of Utrecht, is, perhaps, the only avenue of the &s;ort in Europe, &s;till fit to be u&s;ed for the game that gives its name to them all. The &s;everal
<PB N="76" REF="84">
rows of noble trees include, at the &s;ides, roads and walks; but the centre is laid out for the game of <HI>Mall,</HI> and, though not often u&s;ed, is in perfect pre&s;ervation. It is divided &s;o as to admit of two parties of players at once, and the &s;ide boards &s;ufficiently re&s;train &s;pectators. The Mall in St. James's Park was kept in the &s;ame &s;tate, till 1752, when the pre&s;ent great walk was formed over the part, which was &s;eparated by &s;imilar &s;ide boards. The length of that at Utrecht is nearly three quarters of a mile. The luxuriance and loftine&s;s of the trees pre&s;erve a per&s;pective much &s;uperior to that of St. James's, but in the latter the whole breadth of the walks is greater, and the view is more exten&s;ive, as well as more ornamented.</P>
<P>This city, being a &s;ort of capital to the neighbouring nobility, is called the polite&s;t in the United Provinces, and certainly abounds, more than the others, with the profe&s;&s;ions and trades, which are &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;plendour. One practice, ob&s;erved in &s;ome degree, in all the cities, is mo&s;t frequent here; that of bows paid to all parties, in which there are ladies, by every gentleman who pa&s;&s;es. There are, however, no plays, or other public amu&s;ements; and the fe&s;tivities, or ceremonies, by which other nations commemorate the happier events in their hi&s;tory, are as unu&s;ual here as in the other parts of the United Provinces, where there are more occa&s;ions to celebrate and fewer celebrations than in mo&s;t European countries. Mu&s;ic is very little cultivated in any of the cities, and plays are to be &s;een only at Am&s;terdam and the Hague, where German and Dutch pieces are acted upon alternate nights. At Am&s;terdam, a
<PB N="77" REF="85">
French Opera-hou&s;e has been &s;hut up, and, at the Hague, a <HI>Com&eacute;die,</HI> and the actors ordered to leave the country.</P>
<P>The ramparts of the city, which are high and command exten|&s;ive pro&s;pects, are rather emblems of the peacefulne&s;s, which it has long enjoyed, than &s;igns of any effectual re&s;i&s;tance, prepared for an enemy. They are in many places regularly planted with trees, which mu&s;t be old enough to have been &s;pared, together with the Mall, by Louis the Fourteenth; in others, plea&s;ure hou&s;es, in&s;tead of batteries, have been rai&s;ed upon them. A few pieces of old cannon are planted for the purpo&s;e of &s;aluting the Prince of ORANGE, when he pa&s;&s;es the city.</P>
<P>Trecht&s;chuyts go no further ea&s;tward than this place, &s;o that we hired a voiturier's carriage, a &s;ort of curricle with a driver's box in front, for the journey to Nimeguen. The price for thirty-eight, or thirty-nine miles, was &s;omething more than a guinea and a half; the hor&s;es were worth probably &s;ixty pounds upon the &s;pot, and were as able as they were &s;howy, or they could not have drawn us through the deep &s;ands, that cover one third of the road.</P>
<P>We were now &s;peedily quitting almo&s;t every thing, that is ge|nerally characteri&s;tic of Dutch land. The pa&s;tures were intermixed with fields of pro&s;perous corn; the be&s;t hou&s;es were &s;urrounded by high woods, and the grounds were &s;eparated by hedges, in&s;tead of water, where any &s;ort of partition was u&s;ed. Windmills were &s;eldom &s;een, and tho&s;e only for corn. But the&s;e improvements in the appear|ance
<PB N="78" REF="86">
of the country were accompanied by many &s;ymptoms of a dimini&s;hed pro&s;perity among the people. In eight-and-thirty miles there was not one con&s;iderable town; a &s;pace, which, in the pro|vince of Holland, would probably have included three opulent cities, &s;everal exten&s;ive villages, and ranges of man&s;ions, erected by merchants and manufacturers.</P>
<P><HI>Wyk de Duer&s;tede,</HI> the fir&s;t town in the road, is di&s;tingui&s;hable at &s;ome di&s;tance, by the &s;hattered tower of its church, a monument of the de&s;olation, &s;pread by the Spaniards. The inhabitants, probably intending, that it &s;hould remain as a le&s;&s;on to po&s;terity, have not attempted to re&s;tore it, further than to place &s;ome &s;tones over the part filled by the clock. The body of the church and the re|mainder of the tower are not deficient of Gothic dignity. The town it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts of one, or two wide &s;treets, not well filled either with inhabitants, or hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The road here turns to the ea&s;tward and is led along the right bank of the Leck, one of the branches of the Rhine, upon a rai&s;ed mound, or dique, &s;ometimes twenty, or thirty feet, above the river on the one &s;ide, and the plains, on the other. Small po&s;ts, each numbered, are placed along this road, at unequal di&s;tances, for no other u&s;e, which we could di&s;cover, than to enable the &s;urveyors to report exactly where the mound may want repairs. The car|riage way is formed of a deep &s;and, which we were very glad to leave, by cro&s;&s;ing the river at a ferry; though this road had given us a &s;ine view of its cour&s;e and of &s;ome &s;tately ve&s;&s;els, pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the &s;tream, on their voyage to Germany.</P>

On the other &s;ide, the road went further from the river, though we continued to &s;kirt it occa&s;ionally as far as a &s;mall ferry-hou&s;e, op|po&s;ite to Rhenen, at which we dined, while the hor&s;es re&s;ted under a &s;hed, built over the road, as weigh hou&s;es are at our turnpikes. Rhenen is a walled town, built upon an a&s;cent from the water, and appears to have two, or three neat &s;treets.</P>
<P>Having dined in a room, where a table, large enough for twenty per&s;ons, was placed, on one &s;ide, and a line of four, or five beds, co|vered by one long curtain, was formed again&s;t the wain&s;cot, on the other, the voiturier clamoured, that the gates of Nimeguen would be &s;hut before we could get to them, and we &s;oon began to cro&s;s the country between the Leck and the Waal, another branch of the Rhine, which, in Guelderland, divides it&s;elf into &s;o many channels, that none can be allowed the pre-eminence of retaining its name. Soon after reaching the right bank of the Waal, the road affords a view of the di&s;tant towers of Nimeguen, which appear there to be very important, &s;tanding upon a brow, that &s;eems to front the whole &s;tream of the river. In the way, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal noble e&s;tates, with man&s;ions, built in the ca&s;tellated form, which James the Fir&s;t introduced into England, in&s;tead of the more fortified re&s;idences; and there was a &s;ufficient grandeur of woods and avenues, to &s;hew, that there might be parks, if the owners had the ta&s;te to form them. Be|tween the avenues, the gilded ornaments of the roof, and the peaked coverings, placed, in &s;ummer, over the chimneys, glittered to the light, and &s;hewed the fanta&s;tic &s;tyle of the architecture, &s;o exactly
<PB N="80" REF="88">
copied in Flemi&s;h land&s;capes of the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth cen|turies.</P>
<P>As the &s;un declined and we drew near Nimeguen, the various colouring of a &s;cene more rich than exten&s;ive rendered its effect highly intere&s;ting. The wide Waal on our left, reflecting the even|ing blu&s;h, and a ve&s;&s;el who&s;e full &s;ails caught a yellow gleam from the we&s;t; the ramparts and pointed roofs of Nimeguen ri&s;ing over each other, ju&s;t tinted by the vapour that a&s;cended from the bay below; the faint and fainter blue of two ridges of hills in Germany retiring in the di&s;tance, with the mellow green of nearer woods and meadows, formed a combination of hues &s;urpri&s;ingly gay and beauti|ful. But Nimeguen lo&s;t much of its dignity on a nearer approach; for many of the towers, which the treachery of fancy had painted at di&s;tance, changed into forms le&s;s picture&s;que; and its &s;ituation, which a bold &s;weep of the Waal had repre&s;ented to be on a ri&s;ing penin&s;ula crowning the flood, was found to be only on a &s;teep be&s;ide it. The ramparts, however, the high old tower of the citadel, the Belvidere, with the &s;outhern gate of the town beneath, compo&s;ed part of an intere&s;ting picture on the oppo&s;ite margin of the river. But there was very little time to ob&s;erve it: the driver &s;aw the flying bridge, making its la&s;t voyage, for the night, towards our &s;hore, and likely to return in about twenty minutes; he, therefore, drove furiou&s;ly along the high bank of the river, and, turning the angle of the two roads with a velocity, which would have done honour to a Brent|ford po&s;tillion, entered that adjoining the fir&s;t half of the bridge,
<PB N="81" REF="89">
and &s;hewed the directors of the other half, that we were to be part of their cargo.</P>
<P>This bridge, which is partly laid over boats and partly over two barges, that float from the boats to the &s;hore, is &s;o divided, becau&s;e the &s;tream is occa&s;ionally too rapid to permit an entire range of boats between the two banks. It is thus, for one half, a bridge of boats, and, for the other, a flying bridge; which la&s;t part is capable of con|taining &s;everal carriages, and joins to the other &s;o exactly as not to occa&s;ion the lea&s;t interruption. It is al&s;o railed for the &s;afety of foot pa&s;&s;engers, of whom there are commonly twenty, or thirty. The price for a carriage is &s;omething about twenty-pence, which the tollmen carefully collect as &s;oon as the demi-bridge has begun its voyage.</P>

<P>HAS, towards the water, little other fortification than an antient brick wall, and a gate. Though it is a garri&s;on town, and certainly no trifling object, we were not detained at the gate by trouble&s;ome ceremonies. The commander, affecting no unnece&s;&s;ary carefulne&s;s, is &s;atisfied with a copy of the report, which the inn|keepers, in all the towns, &s;end to the Magi&s;trates, of the names and conditions of their gue&s;ts. A printed paper is u&s;ually brought up, after &s;upper, in which you are a&s;ked to write your name, addition, re&s;idence, how long you intend to &s;tay, and to whom you are known in the province. We did not &s;hew a pa&s;&s;port in Holland.</P>
<P>The town has an abrupt but &s;hort elevation from the river, which you a&s;cend by a narrow but clean &s;treet, opening into a &s;pacious market|place. The great church and the guard-hou&s;e are on one &s;ide of this; from the other, a &s;treet runs to the ea&s;tern gate of the town, formed in the old wall, beyond which commence the modern and &s;trong fortifi|cations, that defend it, on the land &s;ide. At the ea&s;tern extremity of the place, a &s;mall mall leads to the hou&s;e, in which the Prince of Orange re&s;ided, during the troubles of 1786; and, beyond it, on a &s;udden promontory towards the river, &s;tands a pro&s;pect hou&s;e, called
<PB N="83" REF="91">
the Belvidere, which, from its ea&s;tern and &s;outhern windows, com|mands a long view into Germany, and to the north looks over Guel|derland. From this place all the fortifications, which are very ex|ten&s;ive, are plainly &s;een, and a military per&s;on might e&s;timate their &s;trength. There are &s;everal forts and outworks, and, though the ditch is palli&s;adoed in&s;tead of filled, the place mu&s;t be capable of a con&s;iderable defence, unle&s;s the be&s;ieging army &s;hould be ma&s;ters of the river and the oppo&s;ite bank. There was formerly a fortre&s;s upon this bank, which was often won and lo&s;t, during the &s;ieges of Nime|guen, but no remains of it are vi&s;ible now.</P>
<P>The town is cla&s;&s;ic ground to tho&s;e, who venerate the efforts, by which the provinces were re&s;cued from the dominion of the Spaniards. It was fir&s;t attempted by SENGIUS, a Commander in the Earl of LEICESTER'S army, who propo&s;ed to enter it, at night, from the river, through a hou&s;e, which was to be opened to him; but his troops by mi&s;take entered another, where a large company was col|lected, on occa&s;ion of a wedding, and, being thus di&s;covered to the garri&s;on, great numbers of tho&s;e, already landed upon the beach, were put to the &s;word, or drowned in the confu&s;ion of the retreat. An attempt by Prince Maurice to &s;urpri&s;e it was defeated by the failure of a <HI>petard,</HI> applied to one of the gates; but it was &s;oon after taken by a regular &s;iege, carried on chiefly from the other &s;ide of the river. This and the neighbouring fortre&s;s of Grave were among the places, fir&s;t taken by Louis the Fourteenth, during his inva&s;ion, having been left without &s;ufficient garri&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="92">
The citadel, a remnant of the antient fortifications, is near the ea&s;tern gate, which appears to be thought &s;tronger than the others, for, on this &s;ide, al&s;o is the ar&s;enal.</P>
<P>Nimeguen has been compared to Nottingham, which it re&s;embles more in &s;ituation than in &s;tructure, though many of the &s;treets are &s;teep, and the windows of one range of hou&s;es &s;ometimes overlook the chimnies of another; the views al&s;o, as from &s;ome parts of Not|tingham, are over a green and exten&s;ive level, ri&s;ing into di&s;tant hills; and here the compari&s;on ends. The hou&s;es are built entirely in the Dutch fa&s;hion, with many coloured, painted fronts, termi|nating in peaked roofs; but &s;ome decline of neatne&s;s may be ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who arrive here from the province of Holland. The mar|ket-place, though gay and large, cannot be compared with that of Nottingham, in extent, nor is the town more than half the &s;ize of the latter, though it is &s;aid to contain nearly fifty thou&s;and inhabi|tants. From almo&s;t every part of it you have, however, a glimp&s;e of the &s;urrounding land&s;cape, which is more exten&s;ive than that &s;een from Nottingham, and is adorned by the &s;weeps of a river of much greater dignity than the Trent.</P>
<P>We left Nimeguen, in the afternoon, with a Voiturier, who&s;e price, according to the <HI>ordonnatic,</HI> was higher than if we had &s;et out half an hour &s;ooner, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that he could not return that night. The road lies through part of the fortifica|tions, concerning which there can, of cour&s;e, be no &s;ecrecy. It then enters an exten&s;ive plain, and runs almo&s;t parallel to a range of
<PB N="85" REF="93">
heights, at the extremity of which Nimeguen &s;tands, and pre&s;ents an appearance of &s;till greater &s;trength and importance than when &s;een from the we&s;tward.</P>

<P>After a few miles, this road leaves the territories of the United Pro|vinces, and enters the Pru&s;&s;ian duchy of Cleves, at a &s;pot where a mill is in one country, and the miller's hou&s;e in the other. An in&s;tance of difference between the conditions of the people in the two countries was ob&s;ervable even at this pa&s;&s;age of their boundary. Our po&s;tillion bought, at the miller's, a loaf of black bread, &s;uch as is not made in the Dutch provinces, and carried it away for the food of his hor&s;es, which were thus initiated into &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ings of the German pea&s;antry. After another quarter of a mile you have more proofs that you have entered the country of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. From almo&s;t every clu&s;ter of huts barefooted children run out to beg, and ten or a dozen &s;tand at every gate, nearly throwing them&s;elves under the wheels to catch your money, which, every now and then, the bigger &s;eize from the le&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet the land is not ill-cultivated. The di&s;tinction between the culture of land in free and arbitrary countries, was, indeed, never very apparent to us, who &s;hould have been ready enough to perceive it. The great landholders know what &s;hould be done, and the pea|&s;antry are directed to do it. The latter are, perhaps, &s;upplied with &s;tock, and the grounds produce as much as el&s;ewhere, though you
<PB N="86" REF="94">
may read, in the looks and manners of the people, that very little of its productions is for them.</P>
<P>Approaching nearer to Cleves, we travelled on a ridge of heights, and were once more cheared with the <Q REND="inline">"pomp of groves."</Q> Between the branches were delightful catches of exten&s;ive land&s;capes, varied with hills clothed to their &s;ummits with wood, where frequently the di&s;tant &s;pires of a town peeped out mo&s;t picture&s;quely. The open vales between were chiefly &s;pread with corn; and &s;uch a pro&s;pect of undulating ground, and of hills tufted with the grandeur of fore&s;ts, was inexpre&s;&s;ibly chearing to eyes fatigued by the long view of level countries.</P>
<P>At a few miles from Cleves the road enters the Park and a clo&s;e avenue of noble plane-trees, when the&s;e pro&s;pects are, for a while, excluded. The fir&s;t opening is where, on one hand, a &s;econd avenue commences, and, on the other, a &s;ort of broad bay in the woods, which were planted by Prince Maurice, includes an hand&s;ome hou&s;e, now converted into an inn, which, owing to the plea&s;antne&s;s of the &s;ituation, and its vicinity to a mineral &s;pring, is much frequented in &s;ummer. A &s;tatue of General Martin Schenck, of dark bronze, in complete armour, and with the beaver down, is rai&s;ed upon a lofty Ionic column, in the centre of the avenue, before the hou&s;e. Re&s;t|ing upon a lance, the figure &s;eems to look down upon the pa&s;&s;enger, and to watch over the &s;cene, with the &s;ternne&s;s of an ancient knight. It appears to be formed with remarkable &s;kill, and has an air more &s;triking and grand than can be readily de&s;cribed.</P>

<HEAD>CLEVES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS place, which, being the capital of a duchy, is entitled a City, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ome irregular &s;treets, built upon the brow of a &s;teep hill. It is walled, but cannot be mentioned as fortified, having no &s;olid works. The hou&s;es are chiefly built of &s;tone, and there is a little of Dutch cleanline&s;s; but the marks of decay are &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon them, and on the ancient walls. What little trade there is, exi&s;ts in retailing goods &s;ent from Holland. The Dutch language and coins are in circulation here, almo&s;t as much as the German.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the town is Prote&s;tant; but here is an almo&s;t univer&s;al toleration, and the Catholics have &s;everal churches and mona&s;teries. Cleves has &s;uffered a various fate in the &s;port of war during many centuries, but has now little to di&s;tingui&s;h it except the beauty of its pro&s;pects, which extend into Guelderland and the province of Holland, over a country enriched with woody hills and vallies of corn and pa&s;turage.</P>

Being convinced, in two or three hours, that there was nothing to require a longer &s;tay, we &s;et out for Xanten, a town in the &s;ame duchy, di&s;tant about eighteen miles. For nearly the whole of this length the road lay through a broad avenue, which frequently entered a fore&s;t of oak, fir, elm, and maje&s;tic plane-trees, and emer|ged from it only to wind along its &s;kirts. The views then opened over a country, diver&s;ified with gentle hills, and ornamented by numberle&s;s &s;pires upon the heights, every &s;mall town having &s;everal convents. The ca&s;tle of Eltenberg, on the &s;ummit of a wooded mountain, was vi&s;ible during the whole of this &s;tage and part of the next day's journey. Yet the fewne&s;s, or the poverty, of the inha|bitants appeared from our meeting only one chai&s;e, and two or three &s;mall carts, for eighteen miles of the only high-road in the country.</P>
<P>It was a fine evening in June, and the rich lights, thrown among the fore&s;t glades, with the &s;olitary calmne&s;s of the &s;cene, and the &s;erenene&s;s of the air, filled with &s;cents from the woods, were circum|&s;tances which per&s;uaded to &s;uch tranquil rapture as Collins mu&s;t have felt when he had the happine&s;s to addre&s;s to Evening&mdash;<Q><L>For when thy folding &s;tar, ari&s;ing, &s;hews</L>

<P>A &s;mall half-way village, a &s;tately convent, with its gardens, called Marienbaum, founded in the 15th century by Maria, Duche&s;s of Cleves, and a few mud cottages of the woodcutters, were the only buildings on the road: the foot pa&s;&s;engers were two Pru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers. It was moon-light, and we became impatient to reach Xanten, long before our driver could &s;ay, in a mixture of German and Dutch, that we were near it. At length from the woods, that had concealed the town, a few lights appeared over the walls, and di&s;&s;ipated &s;ome gloomy fancies about a night to be pa&s;&s;ed in a fore&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>XANTEN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a &s;mall town, near the Rhine, without much appearance of pro&s;perity, but neater than mo&s;t of the others around it. Several narrow &s;treets open into a wide and plea&s;ant market|place, in the centre of which an old but flouri&s;hing elm has its branches carefully extended by a circular railing, to form an arbour over benches. A cathedral, that proves the town to have been once more con&s;iderable, is on the north &s;ide of this place; a fine building, which, &s;hewn by the moon of a &s;ummer midnight, when only the bell of the adjoining convent calling the monks to prayers, and the waving of the aged tree, were to be heard, pre&s;ented a &s;cene before the windows of our inn, that fully recompen&s;ed for its want of accommodation.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o humbler rea&s;ons towards contentment; for the people of the hou&s;e were extremely de&s;irous to afford it; and the landlord was an orator in French, of which and his addre&s;s he was plea&s;antly vain. He received us with an air of humour, mingled with his complai&s;ance, and hoped, that, <Q REND="inline">"as <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> was <HI>Anglois,</HI> he &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e him with his <HI>vin extraordinaire,</HI> all the Rheni&s;h wine being adulterated by the Dutch, before they &s;ent it to England.

His hou&s;e could not be fine, becau&s;e he had little money; but he had an excellent cook, otherwi&s;e it could not be expected that the pre|bendaries of the cathedral would dine at it, every day, and become, as they were, <HI>vraiment, Mon&s;ieur, gros comme vous me voyez!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>There are in this &s;mall town &s;everal mona&s;teries and one convent of noble canone&s;&s;es, of which la&s;t the members are few and the revenues very great. The interior of the cathedral is nearly as grand as the out&s;ide; and ma&s;s is performed in it with more &s;olemnity than in many, which have larger in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>We left Xanten, the next morning, in high &s;pirits, expecting to reach Cologne, which was little more than fifty miles di&s;tant, before night, though the landlord and the po&s;tma&s;ter hinted, that we &s;hould go no further than Neu&s;s. This was our fir&s;t u&s;e of the German po&s;t, the &s;lowne&s;s of which, though it has been &s;o often de&s;cribed, we had not e&s;timated. The day was inten&s;ely hot, and the road, un&s;heltered by trees, lay over deep &s;ands, that reflected the rays. The refre&s;hing fore&s;ts of ye&s;terday we now &s;everely regretted, and watched impatiently to catch a freer air from the &s;ummit of every hill on the way. The po&s;tillion would permit his hor&s;es to do little more than walk, and every &s;tep threw up heaps of du&s;t into the chai&s;e. It had been &s;o often &s;aid by travellers, that money has as little effect in &s;uch ca&s;es as intreaties, or threats, that we &s;uppo&s;ed this &s;lowne&s;s irremediable, which was really intended only to produce an offer of what we would willingly have given.</P>

<HEAD>RHEINBERG.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;omething more than three hours, we reached Rhein|berg, di&s;tant about nine miles; a place often mentioned in the mili|tary hi&s;tory of the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth centuries, and which we had &s;uppo&s;ed would at lea&s;t gratify us by the &s;hew of magnificent ruins, together with &s;ome remains of its former importance. It is a wretched place of one dirty &s;treet, and three or four hundred mean hou&s;es, &s;urrounded by a decayed wall that never was grand, and half filled by inhabitants, who&s;e indolence, while it is probably more to be pitied than blamed, accounts for the &s;ullenne&s;s and wretchedne&s;s of their appearance. Not one &s;ymptom of labour, or comfort, was to be perceived in the whole town. The men &s;eemed, for the mo&s;t part, to be &s;tanding at their doors, in unbuckled &s;hoes and woollen caps. What few women we &s;aw were brown, without the appearance of health, which their leanne&s;s and dirtine&s;s prevented. Some &s;mall &s;hops of huck&s;ters' wares were the only &s;igns of trade.</P>
<P>The inn, that &s;eemed to be the be&s;t, was &s;uch as might be ex|pected in a remote village, in a cro&s;s road in England. The land|lord was &s;tanding before the door in his cap, and remained there &s;ome time after we had found the way into a &s;itting room, and from thence,
<PB N="93" REF="101">
for want of attendance, into a kitchen; where two women, without &s;tockings, were watching over &s;ome &s;ort of cookery in earthen jugs. We were &s;upplied, at length, with bread, butter and &s;our wine, and did not &s;uffer our&s;elves to con&s;ider this as any &s;pecimen of German towns, becau&s;e Rheinberg was not a &s;tation of the po&s;t; a delu&s;ion, the &s;pirit of which continued through &s;everal weeks, for we were always finding rea&s;ons to believe, that the wretchedne&s;s of pre&s;ent places and per&s;ons was produced by &s;ome circum&s;tances, which would not operate in other di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>This is the condition of a town, which, in the &s;ixteenth and &s;even|teenth centuries, was thought important enough to be five times at|tacked by large armies. FARNESE, the Spani&s;h commander, was di|verted from his attempt upon it, by the nece&s;&s;ity of relieving Zutphen, then be&s;ieged by the Earl of Lecei&s;ter: in 1589, the Marquis of Varambon inve&s;ted it, for the Spaniards, by order of the Prince of Parma; but it was relieved by our Colonel Vere, who, after a long battle, completely defeated the Spani&s;h army. In 1599, when it was attacked by Mendoza, a magazine caught fire. The governor, his family, and a part of the garri&s;on were buried in the ruins of a tower, and the explo&s;ion &s;unk &s;everal ve&s;&s;els in the Rhine; after which, the remainder of the garri&s;on &s;urrendered the place. The Prince of Orange retook it in 1633. Four years afterwards, the Spaniards at|tempted to &s;urpri&s;e it in the night; but the Deputy Governor and others, who perceived that the garri&s;on could not be immediately collected, pa&s;&s;ed the walls, and, pretending to be de&s;erters, mingled
<PB N="94" REF="102">
with the enemy, whom they per&s;uaded to delay the attack for a few minutes. The troops within were in the mean time prepared for their defence, and &s;ucceeded in it; but the Governor, with two officers and fifteen &s;oldiers who had accompanied him, being di&s;covered, were killed. All the&s;e conte&s;ts were for a place not belonging to either party, being in the electorate of Cologne, but which was va|luable to both, for its neighbourhood to their frontiers.</P>
<P>Beyond Rheinberg, our pro&s;pects were exten&s;ive, but not &s;o woody, or &s;o rich as tho&s;e of the day before, and few villages enlivened the land&s;cape. Open corn lands, intermixed with fields of turnips, &s;pread to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, on both &s;ides; on the ea&s;t, the high ridges of the We&s;tphalian mountains &s;hut up the &s;cene. The Rhine, which frequently &s;wept near the road, &s;hewed a broad &s;urface, though &s;hrunk within its &s;andy &s;hores by the dryne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on. Not a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el animated its current, which was here tame and &s;mooth, though often interrupted by &s;ands, that ro&s;e above its level.</P>

A large hou&s;e, which might have been ea&s;ily made convenient, and was really not without plenty, confirmed our notion, that, at the po&s;t &s;tages, there would always be &s;ome accommodation. We dined here, and were well at|tended.

built over the garden wall, had no windows towards the road, but there were &s;everal &s;mall apertures, which looked upon it and beyond to a large tract of inclo&s;ed wood, the property of the convent.</P>

<P>SOON after &s;un-&s;et, we came to Neu&s;s, which, as it is a po&s;t town, and was mentioned as far off as Xanten, we had been &s;ure would afford a comfortable lodging, whether there were any ve&s;tiges, or not, of its ancient and modern hi&s;tory. The view of it, at &s;ome little di&s;tance, did not altogether contradict this notion, for it &s;tands upon a gentle a&s;cent, and the &s;pires of &s;everal convents might ju&s;tly give ideas of a con&s;iderable town to tho&s;e, who had not learned how &s;lightly &s;uch &s;ymptoms are to be attended to in Germany.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the gate, cannon balls of various &s;izes remain in the walls. Within, you enter immediately into a clo&s;e &s;treet of high, but dirty &s;tone hou&s;es, from which you expect to e&s;cape pre&s;ently, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be only &s;ome wretched quarter, appropriated to di&s;ea&s;e and misfortune. You &s;ee no pa&s;&s;engers, but, at the door of every hou&s;e, an haggard group of men and women &s;tare upon you with looks of hungry rage, rather than curio&s;ity, and their gaunt figures
<PB N="97" REF="105">
excite, at fir&s;t, more fear than pity. Continuing to look for the bet|ter quarter, and to pa&s;s between hou&s;es, that &s;eem to have been left after a &s;iege and never entered &s;ince, the other gate of the town at length appears, which you would rather pa&s;s at midnight than &s;top at any place yet perceived. Within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the gate, there is, however, a hou&s;e with a wider front, and windows of un&s;hattered gla&s;s and walls not quite as black as the others, which is known to be the inn only becau&s;e the driver &s;tops there, for, according to the etiquette of &s;ullenne&s;s in Germany, the people of the hou&s;e make no &s;hew of receiving you.</P>
<P>If it had not already appeared, that there was no other inn, you might learn it from the manners of the two ho&s;te&s;&s;es and their &s;ervants. Some &s;ort of accommodation is, however, to be had; and tho&s;e, who have been longer from the civilities and a&s;&s;iduities of &s;imilar places in England, may, by more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and more patience, obtain it &s;ooner than we did. By the&s;e means they may reduce all their difficulties into one, that of determining whether the windows &s;hall be open or &s;hut; whether they will endure the clo&s;e|ne&s;s of the rooms, or will admit air, loaded with the feculence of putrid kennels, that &s;tagnate along the whole town.</P>

<P>This place &s;tood a &s;iege, for twelve months, again&s;t 60,000 men, commanded by CHARLES the BOLD, Duke of Burgundy, and &s;ucceeded in its re&s;i&s;tance. But, in 1586, when it held out for GEBHERT DE TRUSCHES, an Elector of Cologne, expelled by his Chapter, for having married, it was the &s;cene of a dreadful calamity. FARNESE, the Spani&s;h General, who had ju&s;t taken Venlo, marched again&s;t it with an army, enraged at having lo&s;t the plunder of that place by a capitulation. When the inhabitants of Neu&s;s were upon the point of &s;urrendering it, upon &s;imilar terms, the army, re&s;olving not to lo&s;e another prey of blood and gold, ru&s;hed to the a&s;&s;ault, &s;et fire to the place, and murdered all the inhabitants, except a few women and children, who took refuge in two churches, which alone were &s;aved from the flames.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t &s;hock of the &s;urpri&s;e, indignation and pity, excited by the mention of &s;uch events, is overcome, we are, of cour&s;e, anxious to a&s;certain whether the perpetrators of them were previou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed by a voluntary entrance into &s;ituations, that could be &s;uppo&s;ed to mark their characters. This was the army of Philip the Second. The &s;oldiers were probably, for the mo&s;t part, forced into the &s;ervice. The officers, of whom only two are related to have oppo&s;ed the ma&s;&s;acre, could not have been &s;o.</P>

<P>Neu&s;s was rebuilt, on the &s;ame &s;pot; the &s;ituation being conve|nient for an intercour&s;e with the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Rhine, e&s;pe|cially with Du&s;&s;eldorff, to which it is nearly oppo&s;ite. The ancient walls were partly re&s;tored by the French, in 1602. One of the churches, &s;pared by the Spaniards, was founded by a daughter of CHARLEMAGNE, in the ninth century, and is now attached to the Chapter of Noble Ladies of St. Quirin; be&s;ides which there are a Chapter of Canons, and five or &s;ix convents in the place.</P>

<HEAD>COLOGNE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM Neu&s;s hither we pa&s;&s;ed through a deep, &s;andy road, that &s;ometimes wound near the Rhine, the &s;hores of which were yet low and the water tame and &s;hallow. There were no ve&s;&s;els upon it, to give one ideas either of the commerce, or the population of its banks.</P>
<P>The country, for the greater part of twenty miles, was a flat of corn lands; but, within a &s;hort di&s;tance of Cologne, a gentle ri&s;e affords a view of the whole city, who&s;e numerous towers and
<PB N="100" REF="108">
&s;teeples had before appeared, and of the exten&s;ive plains, that &s;pread round it. In the &s;outhern per&s;pective of the&s;e, at the di&s;tance of about eight leagues, ri&s;e the fanta&s;tic forms of what are called the Seven Mountains; we&s;tward, are the cultivated hills, that extend towards Flanders; and, ea&s;tward, over the Rhine, the di&s;tant moun|tains, that run through &s;everal countries of interior Germany. Over the wild and gigantic features of the Seven Mountains dark thun|der mi&s;ts &s;oon &s;pread an awful ob&s;curity, and heightened the ex|pectation, which this glimp&s;e of them had awakened, concerning the &s;cenery we were approaching.</P>
<P>The appearance of Cologne, at the di&s;tance of one, or two miles, is not inferior to the conception, which a traveller may have already formed of one of the capitals of Germany, &s;hould his mind have obeyed that almo&s;t univer&s;al illu&s;ion of fancy, which dre&s;&s;es up the images of places un&s;een, as &s;oon as much expectation, or attention is directed towards them. The air above is crowded with the towers and &s;pires of churches and convents, among which the cathedral, with its huge, unfini&s;hed ma&s;s, has a &s;triking appearance. The walls are al&s;o high enough to be ob&s;erved, and their whole inclo&s;ure &s;eems, at a di&s;tance, to be thickly filled with buildings.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have known our&s;elves to be in the neighbourhood of &s;ome place larger than u&s;ual, from the &s;ight of two, or three car|riages, at once, on the road; nearly the fir&s;t we had &s;een in Germany. There is be&s;ides &s;ome &s;hew of labour in the adjoining villages; but the &s;allow countenances and mi&s;erable air of the people prove, that
<PB N="101" REF="109">
it is not a labour beneficial to them. The hou&s;es are only the de&s;olated homes of the&s;e villagers; for there is not one that can be &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to any pro&s;perous inhabitant of the city, or to afford the coveted &s;tillne&s;s, in which the active find an occa&s;ional reward, and the idle a perpetual mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>A bridge over a dry fo&s;&s;&eacute; leads to the northern gate, on each &s;ide of which a &s;mall modern battery defends the ancient walls. The city is not fortified, according to any pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of the term, but is &s;urrounded by the&s;e walls and by a ditch, of which the latter, near the northern gate, &s;erves as a &s;ort of kitchen garden to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Before pa&s;&s;ing the inner gate, a &s;oldier demanded our names, and we &s;hewed our pa&s;&s;port, for the fir&s;t time; but, as the inqui&s;itor did not under&s;tand French, in which language pa&s;&s;ports from England are written, it was handed to his comrades, who formed a circle about our chai&s;e, and began, with leaden looks, to &s;pell over the paper. Some talked, in the mean time, of examining the bag|gage; and the money, which we gave to prevent this, being in various pieces and in Pru&s;&s;ian coin, which is not perfectly under&s;tood here, the whole party turned from the pa&s;&s;port, counting and e&s;timating the money in the hand of their collector, as openly as if it had been a legal tribute. When this was done and they had heard, with &s;ur|pri&s;e, that we had not determined where to lodge, being inclined to take the plea&s;ante&s;t inn, we wrote our names in the corporal's dirty book, and were allowed to drive, under a dark tower, into the city.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="110">
In&s;tantly, the narrow &s;treet, gloomy hou&s;es, &s;tagnant kennels and wretchedly looking people reminded us of the horrors of Neu&s;s. The lower windows of the&s;e pri&s;on-like hou&s;es are &s;o &s;trongly barricadoed, that we had &s;uppo&s;ed the fir&s;t two, or three, to be really parts of a gaol; but it &s;oon appeared, that this profu&s;ion of heavy iron work was intended to exclude, not to confine, robbers. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of nar|row &s;treets, in which the large&s;t hou&s;es were not le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting than the others for the filthine&s;s of their windows, doorways and ma&s;&s;y walls, continued through half the city. In one of the&s;e &s;treets, or lanes, the po&s;tillion &s;topped at the door of an inn, which he &s;aid was the be&s;t; but the &s;uffocating air of the &s;treet rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary to enquire, whether, contrary to appearances, there could be any accom|modation within, and, as we had read of many &s;quares, or market|places, he was de&s;ired to &s;top at an inn, &s;ituated in one of the&s;e. Thus we came to the Hotel de Prague, a large &s;traggling building, &s;aid to be not wor&s;e than the others, for wanting half its furniture, and probably &s;uperior to them, by having a landlord of better than German civility.</P>
<P>Having counted from our windows the &s;pires of ten, or twelve churches, or convents, we were at lei&s;ure to walk farther into the city, and to look for the &s;pacious &s;quares, neat &s;treets, noble public buildings and hand&s;ome hou&s;es, which there could be no doubt mu&s;t be found in an Imperial and Electoral city, &s;eated on the Rhine, at a point where the chief roads from Holland and Flanders join tho&s;e of Germany, treated by all writers as a con&s;iderable place, and evidently
<PB N="103" REF="111">
by its &s;ituation capable of becoming a &s;ort of <HI>emporium</HI> for the three countries. The &s;pot, into which our inn opened, though a parallelo|gram of con&s;iderable extent, bordered by lime trees, we pa&s;&s;ed quick|ly through, perceiving, that the hou&s;es on all its &s;ides were mean buildings, and therefore &s;uch as could not de&s;erve the attention in the Imperial and Electoral city of Cologne. There are &s;treets from each angle of this place, and we pur&s;ued them all in their turn, narrow, winding and dirty as they are, pe&s;tilent with kennels, gloomy from the height and blackne&s;s of the hou&s;es, unadorned by any public buildings, except the churches, that were grand, or by one private dwelling, that appeared to be clean, with little &s;hew of traffic and le&s;s of pa&s;&s;engers, either bu&s;y, or gay, till we &s;aw them ending in other &s;treets &s;till wor&s;e, or concluded by the gates of the city. One of them, indeed, led through a market-place, in which the air is free from the feculence of the &s;treets, but which is inferior to the other opening in &s;pace, and not better &s;urrounded by buildings.</P>

Authors are not always free from a willingne&s;s to receive the fallacious &s;ort of re&s;pect, that attaches to accidental circum&s;tances, for the real &s;ort, of which it would be more rea&s;onable to be proud. A man, relating part of the hi&s;tory of his life, which is always nece&s;&s;arily done by a writer of travels, does not choo&s;e to &s;hew that his cour&s;e could lie through any &s;cenes deficient of delights; or that, if it did, he was not enough elevated by his friends, importance, fortune, fame, or bu&s;i|ne&s;s, to be incapable of ob&s;erving them minutely. The curio&s;ities of cabinets and of courts are, therefore, exactly de&s;cribed, and as much of every occurrence as does not &s;hew the relater moving in any of the plainer walks of life; but the difference between the &s;tock of phy&s;ical comforts in different countries, the character of conditions, if the phra&s;e may be u&s;ed, &s;uch as it appears in the ordinary circum|&s;tances of re&s;idence, dre&s;s, food, cleanline&s;s, opportunities of relaxa|tion; in &s;hort, the information, which all may gain, is &s;ometimes left to be gained by all, not from the book, but from travel. A writer, i&s;&s;uing into the world, makes up what he mi&s;takes for his be&s;t appearance, and is continually telling his happine&s;s, or &s;hewing his good-humour, as people in a promenade always &s;mile, and always look round to ob&s;erve whether they are &s;een &s;miling. The polite&s;t &s;alutation of the Chine&s;e, when they meet, is, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, pro&s;perity is painted on your countenance;"</Q> or, <Q REND="inline">"your whole air announces

<P>Cologne, though it bears the name of the Electorate, by which it is &s;urrounded, is an imperial city; and the Elector, as to temporal affairs, has very little juri&s;diction within it. The government has an affecta|tion of being formed upon the model of Republican Rome; a form certainly not worthy of imitation, but which is as much di&s;graced by this burle&s;que of it, as ancient &s;tatues are by the gilding and the wigs, with which they are &s;aid to be &s;ometimes arrayed by modern hands. There is a &s;enate of forty-nine per&s;ons, who, being returned at dif|ferent times of the year, are partly nominated by the remaining members, and partly cho&s;en by twenty-two tribes of burge&s;&s;es, or rather by &s;o many companies of traders. Of &s;ix burgoma&s;ters, two are in office every third year, and, when the&s;e appear in public, they are preceded by LICTORS, bearing <HI>fa&s;ces,</HI> &s;urmounted by their <HI>own arms!</HI> Each of the tribes, or companies, has a Pre&s;ident, and the twenty-two Pre&s;idents form a Council, which is authori&s;ed to enquire into the conduct of the Senate: but the humblene&s;s of the burge&s;&s;es in their individual condition has virtually aboli&s;hed all this &s;cheme of a political con&s;titution. Without &s;ome of the intelligence and per|&s;onal independence, which are but little con&s;i&s;tent with the general poverty and indolence of German traders, nothing but the forms of any con&s;titution can be pre&s;erved, long after the virtual de&s;truction of
<PB N="106" REF="114">
it has been meditated by tho&s;e in a better condition. The greater part of the&s;e companies of traders having, in fact, no trade which can place them much above the rank of menial &s;ervants to their rich cu&s;tomers, the de&s;ign, that their Council &s;hall check the Senate, and the Senate direct the Burgoma&s;ters, has now, of cour&s;e, little effect. And this, or a &s;till humbler condition, is that of &s;everal cities in Ger|many, called free and independent, in which the neighbouring &s;ove|reigns have &s;carcely le&s;s authority, though with &s;omething more of circum&s;tance, than in their own dominions.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of Cologne permits, indeed, &s;ome direct interfer|ence of the Elector; for the Tribunal of Appeal, which is the &s;upreme court of law, is nominated by him: he has otherwi&s;e no direct power within the city; and, being forbidden to re&s;ide there more than three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, he does not even retain a palace, but is contented with a &s;uite of apartments, re&s;erved for his u&s;e at an inn. That this exclu&s;ion is no puni&s;hment, tho&s;e, who have ever pa&s;&s;ed two days at Cologne, will admit; and it can tend very little to le&s;&s;en his influence, for the greate&s;t part of his per&s;onal expenditure mu&s;t reach the mer|chants of the place; and the officers of &s;everal of his territorial juri&s;|dictions make part of the inhabitants. His re&s;idences, with which he is remarkably well provided, are at Bonn; at Bruhl, a palace between Cologne and that place; at Poppel&s;dorff, which is beyond it; at Her|zogs Freud, an hunting &s;eat; and in Mun&s;ter, of which he is the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The duties of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e are impo&s;ed by the magi&s;trates of
<PB N="107" REF="115">
the city, and the&s;e enable them to pay their contributions to the Ger|manic fund; for, though &s;uch cities are formally independent of the neighbouring princes and nobility, they are not &s;o of the general laws or expences of the empire, in the Diet of which they have &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare, forty-nine cities being allowed to &s;end two repre&s;entatives, and thus to have two votes out of an hundred and thirty-&s;ix. The&s;e duties, of both &s;orts, are very high at Cologne; and the fir&s;t form a con&s;ider|able part of the interruptions, which all the States upon the Rhine give to the commerce of that river. Here al&s;o commodities, in|tended to be carried beyond the city by water, mu&s;t be re-&s;hipped; for, in order to provide cargoes for the boatmen of the place, ve&s;&s;els from the lower parts of the Rhine are not allowed to a&s;cend beyond Cologne, and tho&s;e from the higher parts cannot de&s;cend it farther. They may, indeed, reload with other cargoes for their return; and, as they con&s;tantly do &s;o, the Cologne boatmen are not much benefited by the regulation; but the transfer of the goods employs &s;ome hands, &s;ubjects them better to the in&s;pection of the cu&s;tomhou&s;e officers, and makes it nece&s;&s;ary for the merchants of places, on both &s;ides, trading with each other, to have intermediate corre&s;pondents here. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this aggre&s;&s;ion upon the freedom of trade, Cologne is le&s;s con&s;iderable as a port, than &s;ome Dutch towns, never mentioned in a book, and is inferior, perhaps, to half the minor &s;ea|ports in England. We could not find more than thirty ve&s;&s;els of burthen again&s;t the quay, all mean and ill-built, except the Dutch, which are very large, and, being con&s;tructed purpo&s;ely for a tedious navigation, contain apartments upon the deck for the family of the
<PB N="108" REF="116">
&s;kipper, well furni&s;hed, and &s;o commodious as to have four or five &s;a&s;hed windows on each &s;ide, generally gay with flower-pots. Little flower-gardens, too, &s;ometimes formed upon the roof of the cabin, increa&s;e the dome&s;tic comforts of the &s;kipper; and the neatne&s;s of his ve&s;&s;el can, perhaps, be equalled only by that of a Dutch hou&s;e. In a time of perfect peace, there is no doubt more traffic; but, from what we &s;aw of the general means and occa&s;ions of commerce in Germany, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e it to be much reduced by war. Wealthy and commercial countries may be injured immen&s;ely by making war either for Germany or again&s;t it; by too much friend&s;hip or too much enmity; but Germany it&s;elf cannot be proportionately injured with them, except when it is the &s;cene of actual violence. Engli&s;hmen, who feel, as they always mu&s;t, the love of their own country much increa&s;ed by the view of others, &s;hould be induced, at every &s;tep, to wi&s;h, that there may be as little political intercour&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, either of friend&s;hip or enmity, between the ble&s;&s;ings of their I&s;land and the wretchedne&s;s of the Continent.</P>
<P>Our inn had formerly been a convent, and was in a part of the town where &s;uch &s;ocieties are more numerous than el&s;ewhere. At five o'clock, on the Sunday after our arrival, the bells of churches and convents began to &s;ound on all &s;ides, and there was &s;carcely any entire intermi&s;&s;ion of them till evening. The places of public amu&s;e|ment, chiefly a &s;ort of tea-gardens, were then &s;et open, and, in many &s;treets, the &s;ound of mu&s;ic and dancing was heard almo&s;t as plainly as that of the bells had been before; a di&s;gu&s;ting exce&s;s of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="109" REF="117">
which appeared in other in&s;tances, for we heard, at the &s;ame time, the voices of a choir on one &s;ide of the &s;treet, and the noi&s;e of a billiard table on the other. Near the inn, this contra&s;t was more ob&s;ervable. While the &s;trains of revelry aro&s;e from an adjoining garden, into which our windows opened, a pau&s;e in the mu&s;ic allowed us to catch &s;ome notes of the ve&s;per &s;ervice, performing in a convent of the order of Clari&s;&s;e, only three or four doors beyond. Of the &s;evere rules of this &s;ociety we had been told in the morning. The members take a vow, not only to renounce the world, but their deare&s;t friends, and are never after permitted to &s;ee even their fathers or mothers, though they may &s;ometimes conver&s;e with the latter from behind a curtain. And, le&s;t &s;ome lingering remains of filial affection &s;hould tempt an unhappy nun to lift the veil of &s;eparation between her&s;elf and her mother, &s;he is not allowed to &s;peak even with her, but in the pre&s;ence of the abbe&s;s. Accounts of &s;uch hor|rible perver&s;ions of human rea&s;on make the blood thrill and the teeth chatter. Their fathers they can never &s;peak to, for no man is &s;uf|fered to be in any part of the convent u&s;ed by the &s;i&s;terhood, nor, indeed, is admitted beyond the gate, except when there is a nece&s;&s;ity for repairs, when all the votaries of the order are previou&s;ly &s;ecluded. It is not ea&s;ily, that a cautious mind becomes convinced of the exi&s;t|ence of &s;uch &s;evere orders; when it does, a&s;toni&s;hment at the artificial mi&s;eries, which the ingenuity of human beings forms for them&s;elves by &s;eclu&s;ion, is as boundle&s;s as at the other mi&s;eries, with which the mo&s;t trivial vanity and envy &s;o frequently pollute the intercour&s;es of &s;ocial life. The poor nuns, thus nearly entombed during their lives,
<PB N="110" REF="118">
are, after death, tied upon a board, in the clothes they die in, and, with only their veils thrown over the face, are buried in the garden of the convent.</P>
<P>During this day, Trinity Sunday, proce&s;&s;ions were pa&s;&s;ing on all &s;ides, mo&s;t of them attended by &s;ome &s;ort of martial mu&s;ic. Many of the pari&s;hes, of which there are nineteen, paraded with their officers; and the burge&s;&s;es, who are di&s;tributed into eight corps, under a &s;uppo&s;ition that they could and would defend the city, if it was attacked, pre&s;ented their captains at the churches. The ho&s;t accompanied all the&s;e proce&s;&s;ions. A party of the city guards fol|lowed, and forty or fifty per&s;ons out of uniform, the repre&s;entatives probably of the burge&s;&s;es, who are about &s;ix thou&s;and, &s;ucceeded. Be&s;ides the guards, there was only one man in uniform, who, in the burle&s;que dre&s;s of a drum-major, entertained the populace by a kind of extravagant marching dance, in the middle of the proce&s;&s;ion. Our companion would not tell us that this was the captain.</P>
<P>The cathedral, though unfini&s;hed, is con&s;picuous, among&s;t a great number of churches, for the dignity of &s;ome detached features, that &s;hew part of the va&s;t de&s;ign formed for the whole. It was begun, in 1248, by the Elector Conrad, who is related, in an hexameter in&s;crip|tion over a gate, to have laid the fir&s;t &s;tone him&s;elf. In 1320, the choir was fini&s;hed, and the workmen continued to be employed upon the other parts in 1499, when of two towers, de&s;tined to be 580 feet above the roof, one had ri&s;en 21 feet, and the other 150 feet, accord|ing to the mea&s;urement mentioned in a printed de&s;cription. We did not learn at what period the de&s;ign of completing the edifice was
<PB N="111" REF="119">
abandoned; but the original founder lived to &s;ee all the trea&s;ures expended, which he had collected for the purpo&s;e. In its pre&s;ent &s;tate, the inequality of its va&s;t towers renders it a &s;triking object at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and, from the large unfilled area around it, the magnificence of its Gothic architecture, e&s;pecially of &s;ome parts, which have not been joined to the re&s;t, and appear to be the ruined remains, rather than the commencement of a work, is viewed with awful delight.</P>
<P>In the interior of the cathedral, a fine choir leads to an altar of black marble, rai&s;ed above &s;everal &s;teps, which, being free from the incongruous ornaments u&s;ual in Romi&s;h churches, is left to impre&s;s the mind by its maje&s;tic plainne&s;s The tall painted windows above, of which there are &s;ix, are &s;uperior in richne&s;s of colouring and de&s;ign to any we ever &s;aw; beyond even tho&s;e in the Chapter-hou&s;e at York, and mo&s;t re&s;embling the very fine ones in the cathedral of Can|terbury. The nave is deformed by a low wooden roof, which appears to have been intended only as a temporary covering, and &s;hould certainly be &s;ucceeded by one of equal dignity to the va&s;t columns placed for its &s;upport, whether the other parts of the original de&s;ign can ever be completed or not.</P>
<P>By &s;ome accident we did not &s;ee the tomb of the three kings of Jeru&s;alem, who&s;e bodies are affirmed to have been brought here from Milan in 1162, when the latter city was de&s;troyed by the Emperor Frederic Barbaro&s;&s;a. Their boa&s;ted trea&s;ures of golden crowns and diamonds pa&s;s, of cour&s;e, without our e&s;timation.</P>

A de&s;cription of the churches in Cologne, &s;et out with good antiquarian minutene&s;s, would fill volumes. The whole number of churches, chapters and chapels, which la&s;t are by far the mo&s;t nu|merous, is not le&s;s than eighty, and none are without an hi&s;tory of two or three centuries. They are all opened on Sundays; and we can believe, that the city may contain, as is a&s;&s;erted, 40,000 &s;ouls, for nearly all that we &s;aw were well attended. In one, indeed, the congregation con&s;i&s;ted only of two or three females, kneeling at a great di&s;tance from the altar, with an appearance of the utmo&s;t intentne&s;s upon the &s;ervice, and ab&s;traction from the noi&s;e of the proce&s;&s;ions, that could be ea&s;ily heard within. They were entirely covered with a loo&s;e black drapery; whether for penance, or not, we did not hear. In the cathedral, a figure in the &s;ame attitude was rendered more intere&s;ting by her &s;ituation beneath the broken arches and &s;hattered fret-work of a painted window, through which the rays of the &s;un &s;carcely penetrated to break the &s;hade &s;he had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Several of the chapels are not much larger than an ordinary apart|ment, but they are higher, that the nuns of &s;ome adjoining convent may have a gallery, where, veiled from ob&s;ervation by a lawn curtain, their voices often mingle &s;weetly with the choir. There are thirty-nine convents of women and nineteen of men, which are &s;up|po&s;ed to contain about fifteen hundred per&s;ons. The chapters, of which &s;ome are noble and extremely opulent, &s;upport nearly four hundred more; and there are &s;aid to be, upon the whole, between two and three thou&s;and per&s;ons, under religious denominations, in
<PB N="113" REF="121">
Cologne. Walls of convents and their gardens appear in every &s;treet, but do not attract notice, unle&s;s, as frequently happens, their bell &s;ounds while you are pa&s;&s;ing. Some of their female inhabitants may be &s;een in various parts of the city, for there is an order, the members of which are employed, by rotation, in teaching children and attending the &s;ick. Tho&s;e of the noble chapters are little more confined than if they were with their own families, being permitted to vi&s;it their friends, to appear at balls and promenades, to wear what dre&s;&s;es they plea&s;e, except when they chaunt in the choir, and to quit the chapter, if the offer of an acceptable marriage induces their families to authori&s;e it; but their own admi&s;&s;ion into the chapter proves them to be noble by &s;ixteen quarterings, or four generations, and the offer mu&s;t be from a per&s;on of equal rank, or their de&s;cend|ants could not be received into &s;imilar chapters; an important cir|cum&s;tance in the affairs of the German noble&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e ladies we &s;aw in the church of their convent. Their habits were remarkably graceful; robes of lawn and black &s;ilk flowed from the &s;houlder, whence a quilled ruff, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of Queen Elizabeth's time, &s;pread round the neck. The hair was in curls, without powder, and in the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion. Their voices were peculiarly &s;weet, and they &s;ung the re&s;pon&s;es with a kind of plaintive tenderne&s;s, that was extremely intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits' church is one of the grande&s;t in Cologne, and has the greate&s;t di&s;play of paintings over its numerous altars, as well as of marble pillars. The churches of the chapters are, for the mo&s;t part, very large, and endowed with the riche&s;t ornaments, which are, how|ever,
<PB N="114" REF="122">
not &s;hewn to the public, except upon days of f&ecirc;te. We do not remember to have &s;een that of the chapter of St. Ur&s;ula, where heads and other relics are &s;aid to be handed to you from &s;helves, like books in a library; nor that of the convent of Jacobins, where &s;ome MSS. and other effects of Albert the Great, bi&s;hop of Rati&s;bon, are among the trea&s;ures of the monks.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the Je&s;uits' church was an ho&s;pital for wounded &s;ol|diers, &s;everal of whom were walking in the court yard before it, half|cloathed in dirty woollen, through which the bare arms of many appeared. Sickne&s;s and neglect had &s;ubdued all the &s;ymptoms of a &s;oldier; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the wounded French from the others, though we were a&s;&s;ured that &s;everal of that nation were in the crowd. The windows of the ho&s;pital were filled with figures &s;till more wretched. There was a large a&s;&s;emblage of &s;pecta|tors, who looked as if they were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee, that war is com|pounded of &s;omething el&s;e, be&s;ides the glories, of which it is &s;o ea&s;y to be informed.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiery of Cologne are under the command of the magi&s;trates, and are employed only within the gates of the city. The whole body does not exceed an hundred and fifty, whom we &s;aw reviewed by their colonel, in the place before the Hotel de Prague. The uni|form is red, faced with white. The men wear whi&s;kers, and affect an air of ferocity, but appear to be mo&s;tly invalids, who have grown old in their guard-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Prote&s;tants, though protected in their per&s;ons, are not allowed the exerci&s;e of their religion within the walls of the city, but have a cha|pel
<PB N="115" REF="123">
in a village on the other &s;ide of the Rhine. As &s;ome of the chief merchants, and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t u&s;eful to the inhabitants, are of the reformed church, they ventured lately to reque&s;t that they might have a place of wor&s;hip within the city; but they received the common an&s;wer, which oppo&s;es all &s;ort of improvement, religious or civil, that, though the privilege in it&s;elf might be ju&s;tly required, it could not be granted, becau&s;e they would then think of a&s;king &s;ome|thing more.</P>
<P>The government of Cologne in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs is with the Elector, as archbi&s;hop, and the Chapter as his council. In civil mat|ters, though the city con&s;titution is of little effect, the real power is not &s;o con&s;tantly with him as might be &s;uppo&s;ed; tho&s;e, who have influence, being &s;ometimes out of his intere&s;t. Conver&s;ation, as we were told, was &s;carcely le&s;s free than in Holland, where there is ju&s;tly no oppo&s;ition to any opinion, however improper, or ab&s;urd, except from the rea&s;on of tho&s;e, who hear it. On that account, and becau&s;e of its ea&s;y intercour&s;e with Bru&s;&s;els and Spa, this city is &s;omewhat the re&s;ort of &s;trangers, by whom &s;uch conver&s;ation is, perhaps, chiefly carried on; but tho&s;e mu&s;t come from very wretched countries, who can find plea&s;ure in a re&s;idence at Cologne.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the public buildings mu&s;t be reckoned the Theatre, of which we did not &s;ee the in&s;ide, there being no performance, during our &s;tay, except on Sunday. This, it &s;eems, may be opened, with|out offence to the Magi&s;trates, though a prote&s;tant church may not. It &s;tands in a row of &s;mall hou&s;es, from which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed only by a painted front, once tawdry and now dirty, with the in&s;crip|tion,
<PB N="116" REF="124">
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mu&s;is Gratii&s;que decentibus.</HI>"</Q> The Town-hou&s;e is an awk|ward and irregular &s;tone building. The ar&s;enal, which is in one of the narrowe&s;t &s;treets, we &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed, without notice, if it had not been pointed out to us. As a building, it is nothing more than &s;uch as might be formed out of four or five of the plaine&s;t hou&s;es laid into one. Its contents are &s;aid to be chiefly antient arms, of various fa&s;hions and &s;izes, not very proper for modern u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>BONN.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a &s;tay of nearly three tedious days, we left Cologne for Bonn, pa&s;&s;ing through an avenue of limes, which extends from one place to the other, without interruption, except where there is a &s;mall half way village. The di&s;tance is not le&s;s than eighteen miles, and the diver&s;ified culture of the plains, through which it pa&s;&s;es, is unu&s;ually grateful to the eye, after the dirty buildings of Cologne and the long uniformity of corn lands in the approach to it. Vines cover a great part of the&s;e plains, and are here fir&s;t &s;een in Germany, except, indeed, within the walls of Cologne it&s;elf, which contain many large inclo&s;ures, converted from gardens and orchards into well &s;heltered vineyards. The vines reminded us of Engli&s;h hop plants, being &s;et, like them, in rows, and led round poles to various heights, though all le&s;s than that of hops. Corn, fruit or herbs were frequently growing between the rows, who&s;e light green foliage mingled beautifully with yellow wheat and larger patches of garden plantations, that &s;pread, without any
<PB N="117" REF="125">
inclo&s;ures, to the &s;weeping Rhine, on the left. Beyond, appeared the blue ridges of We&s;tphalian mountains. On the right, the plains extend to a chain of lower and le&s;s di&s;tant hills, who&s;e &s;kirts are covered with vines and &s;ummits darkened with thick woods.</P>
<P>The Elector's palace of Bruhl is on the right hand of the road, at no great di&s;tance, but we were not told, till afterwards, of the mag|nificent architecture and furniture, which ought to have attracted our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>On a green and circular hill, near the Rhine, &s;tands the Bene|dictine abbey of Siegbourg, one of the fir&s;t picture&s;que objects of the rich approach to Bonn; and, further on, the ca&s;tle-like towers of a convent of noble ladies; both &s;ocieties celebrated for their wealth and the plea&s;antne&s;s of their &s;ituations, which command exten&s;ive pro&s;pects over the country, on each &s;ide of the river. As we drew near Bonn, we frequently caught, between the trees of the avenue, imperfect, but awakening glimp&s;es of the pointed mountains beyond; contra&s;ted with the &s;olemn grandeur of which was the beauty of a round woody hill, apparently &s;eparated from them only by the Rhine and crowned with the &s;pire of a comely convent. Bonn, with tall &s;lender &s;teeples and the trees of its ramparts, thus backed by &s;ublime mountains, looks well, as you approach it from Cologne, though neither its noble palace, nor the Rhine, which wa&s;hes its walls, are &s;een from hence.</P>
<P>We were a&s;ked our names at the gate, but had no trouble about pa&s;&s;ports, or baggage. A long and narrow &s;treet leads from thence to the market place, not di&s;gu&s;ting you either with the gloom, or the
<PB N="118" REF="126">
dirt of Cologne, though mean hou&s;es are abundantly intermixed with the others, and the be&s;t are far from admirable. The <HI>phy|&s;iognomy of the place,</HI> if one may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, is whole&s;ome, though humble. By the recommendation of a Dutch merchant, we went to an inn in another &s;treet, branching from the market place, and found it the cleane&s;t, &s;ince we had left Holland.</P>
<P>Bonn may be called the political capital of the country, the Elector's Court being held only there; and, what would not be expected, this has importance enough to command the re&s;idence of an agent from almo&s;t every Power in Europe. The pre&s;ent Elector being the uncle of the Emperor, this attention is, perhaps, partly paid, with the view, that it may be felt at the Court of Vienna. Even Ru&s;&s;ia is not unrepre&s;ented in this miniature State.</P>
<P>The Elector's palace is, in point of grandeur, much better fitted to be the &s;cene of diplomatic ceremonies, than tho&s;e of many greater Sovereigns; and it is fitted al&s;o for better than diplomatic purpo&s;es, being placed before &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking of nature's features, of which it is nearly as worthy an ornament as art can make. It is &s;eated on the we&s;tern bank of the Rhine, the general cour&s;e of which it fronts, though it forms a con&s;iderable angle with the part imme|diately neare&s;t. The fir&s;t emotion, on perceiving it, being that of admiration, at its va&s;tne&s;s, the wonder is, of cour&s;e, equal, with which you di&s;cover, that it is only part of a greater de&s;ign. It con|&s;i&s;ts of a centre and an ea&s;tern wing, which are completed, and of a we&s;tern wing, of which not half is yet rai&s;ed. The extent from ea&s;t to we&s;t is &s;o great, that, if we had enquired the mea&s;urement,
<PB N="119" REF="127">
we &s;hould have been but little a&s;&s;i&s;ted in giving an idea of the &s;pec|tacle, exhibited by &s;o immen&s;e a building.</P>
<P>It is of &s;tone, of an architecture, perhaps, not adequate to the grandeur of its extent, but which fills no part with un&s;uitable, or inelegant ornaments. Along the whole garden front, which is the chief, a broad terrace &s;upports a promenade and an orangery of noble trees, occa&s;ionally refre&s;hed by fountains, that, ornamented with &s;tatues, ri&s;e from marble bafons. An arcade through the centre of the palace leads to this terrace, from whence the pro&s;pect is &s;trik|ingly beautiful and &s;ublime. The eye pa&s;&s;es over the green lawn of the garden and a tract of level country to the groupe, called the Seven Mountains, broken, rocky and abrupt towards their &s;um|mits, yet &s;weeping finely near their ba&s;es, and uniting with the plains by long and gradual de&s;cents, that &s;pread round many miles. The neare&s;t is about a league and a half off. We &s;aw them under the cloudle&s;s &s;ky of June, inve&s;ted with the mi&s;tine&s;s of heat, which, &s;oftening their rocky points, and half veiling their rece&s;&s;es, left much for the imagination to &s;upply, and gave them an a&euml;rial appearance, a faint tint of &s;ilvery grey, that was inexpre&s;&s;ibly intere&s;ting. The Rhine, that winds at their feet, was concealed from us by the garden groves, but from the upper windows of the palace it is &s;een in all its maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>On the right from this terrace, the &s;maller palace of Poppel&s;dorff terminates a long avenue of limes and che&s;nut trees, that commu|nicates with both buildings, and above are the hill and the convent <HI>Sanctae Crucis,</HI> the latter looking out from among &s;irs and &s;hrubby
<PB N="120" REF="128">
&s;teeps. From thence the we&s;tern horizon is bounded by a range of hills, cloathed to their &s;ummits with wood. The plain, that extends between the&s;e and the Rhine, is cultivated with vines and corn, and the middle di&s;tance is marked by a pyramidal mountain, darkened by wood and crowned with the tower and walls of a ruined ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The gardens of the palace are formally laid out in &s;traight walks and alleys of cut trees; but the &s;pacious lawn between the&s;e gives fine effect to the per&s;pective of the di&s;tant mountains; and the bowery walks, while they afford refre&s;hing &s;helter from a &s;ummer &s;un, allow partial views of the palace and the romantic land&s;cape.</P>
<P>It was the Elector Jo&s;eph Clement, the &s;ame who repaired the city, left in a ruinous &s;tate by the &s;iege of 1703, under the Duke of Marlborough, that built this magnificent re&s;idence. There are in it many &s;uites of &s;tate rooms and every &s;ort of apartment u&s;ual in the man&s;ions of Sovereigns; &s;aloons of audience and ceremony, a library, a cabinet of natural hi&s;tory and a theatre. Though the&s;e are readily opened to &s;trangers, we are to confe&s;s, that we did not &s;ee them, being prevented by the attentions of tho&s;e, who&s;e civi|lities gave them a right to command us, while their &s;ituations enabled them to point out the be&s;t occupation of our time. The hall of the grand ma&s;ter of the Teutonic order, ornamented with portraits of all the grand ma&s;ters, we are, however, &s;orry to have neglected even for the delights of Poppel&s;dorff, which we were pre|&s;ently &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Leaving the palace, we pa&s;&s;ed through the garden, on the right, to a fine avenue of turf, nearly a mile long, bordered by alleys of
<PB N="121" REF="129">
tall trees, and &s;o wide, that the late Elector had de&s;igned to form a canal in the middle of it, for an opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing between his palaces, by land, or water, as he might wi&s;h. The palace of Poppel&s;dorff terminates the per&s;pective of this avenue. It is a &s;mall building, &s;urrounded by its gardens, in a ta&s;te not very good, and remarkable chiefly for the plea&s;antne&s;s of its &s;ituation. An arcade, encompa&s;&s;ing a court in the interior, communicates with all the apartments on the ground floor, which is the principal, and with the gardens, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the chateau. The entrance is through a &s;mall hall, decorated with the en&s;igns of hunting, and round nearly the whole arcade &s;tags' heads are placed, at equal di&s;tances. The&s;e have remained here, &s;ince the reign of Clement Augu&s;tus, the founder of the palace, who died in 1761; and they exhibit &s;ome part of the hi&s;tory of his life; for, under each, is an in&s;cription, relating the events and date of the hunt, by which he killed it. There are twenty-three &s;uch ornaments.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the furniture had been removed, during the approach of the French, in 1792; and the Archduche&s;s Maria Chri&s;tina, to whom the Elector, her brother, had lent the chateau, was now very far from &s;umptuou&s;ly accommodated. On this account, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed much of her time, at Goode&s;berg, a &s;mall watering place in the neighbourhood. After her retreat from Bru&s;&s;els, in con&s;e|quence of the advances of the French in the &s;ame year, &s;he had accompanied her hu&s;band, the Duke of Saxe Te&s;chen, into Saxony; but, &s;ince his appointment to the command of the Emperor's army
<PB N="122" REF="130">
of the Upper Rhine, her re&s;idence had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the domi|nions of her brother.</P>
<P>We were &s;hewn through her apartments, which &s;he had left for Goode&s;berg, a few hours before. On the table of her &s;itting room lay the fragments of a painted cro&s;s, compo&s;ed of &s;mall pieces, like our di&s;&s;ected maps, the putting of which together exerci&s;es inge|nuity and pa&s;&s;es, perhaps, for a &s;ort of piety. The attendant &s;aid, that it &s;erved to pa&s;s the time; but it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that rank and fortune have &s;o little power to be&s;tow happine&s;s, as that their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hould have recour&s;e to &s;uch means of lightening the hours of life.</P>
<P>On another table, was &s;pread a map of all the countries, then included in the Theatre of War, and on it a box, filled with &s;mall pieces of various coloured wax, intended to mark the po&s;itions of the different armies. The&s;e were of many &s;hades, for the Arch|duche&s;s, who is &s;aid to be conver&s;ant with military affairs and to have de&s;cended to the firing of bombs at the &s;iege of Li&s;le, was able to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;everal corps of the allied armies, that were acting &s;eparately from each other. The po&s;itions were marked up to the late&s;t accounts then public. The cour&s;e of her thoughts was vi&s;ible from this chart, and they were intere&s;ting to curio&s;ity, being tho&s;e of the &s;i&s;ter of the late unfortunate Queen of France.</P>
<P>The walls of an adjoining cabinet were ornamented with draw|ings from the antique by the Archduche&s;s, di&s;po&s;ed upon a light ground and &s;erving in&s;tead of tape&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="131">
The chapel is a rotunda, ri&s;ing into a dome, and, though &s;mall, is &s;plendid with painting and gilding. In the centre are four altars, formed on the four &s;ides of a &s;quare pede&s;tal, that &s;upports a figure of our Saviour; but the beauty of this de&s;ign is marred by the vanity of placing near each altar the &s;tatue of a founder of the Teutonic order. The furniture of the Elector's gallery is of crim&s;on velvet and gold.</P>
<P>On another &s;ide of the chateau, we were &s;hewn an apartment entirely covered with grotto work, and called the hall of &s;hells; a curious in&s;tance of patient indu&s;try, having been completed by one man, during a labour of many years. Its &s;ituation in the middle of an inhabited man&s;ion is un&s;uitable to the character of a grotto; but its coolne&s;s mu&s;t render it a very convenient retreat, and the like|ne&s;&s;es of animals, as well as the other forms, into which the &s;hells are thrown, though not very elegant, are fanciful enough, e&s;pecially as the ornaments of fountains, which play into &s;everal parts of the room.</P>
<P>Leaving the palace by the bridge of a moat, that nearly &s;urrounds it, we pa&s;&s;ed through the plea&s;ant village of Poppel&s;dorff, and a&s;cended the hill SANCTAE CRUCIS, called &s;o from the convent of the &s;ame name, which occupies its &s;ummit. The road wound between thick woods, but we &s;oon left it for a path, that led more immediately to the &s;ummit, among &s;hrubs and plantations of larch and fir, and which opened into ea&s;y avenues of turf, that &s;ometimes allowed momentary views of other woody points and of the plains
<PB N="124" REF="132">
around. The turf was uncommonly fragrant and fine, abounding with plants, which made us regret the want of a Botani&s;t's know|ledge and plea&s;ures. During the a&s;cent, the peaked tops of the mountains of the Rhine, &s;o often admired below, began to appear above a ridge of dark woods, very near us, in a contra&s;t of hues, which was exqui&s;itely fine. It was now near evening; the mi&s;tine&s;s of heat was gone from the &s;urface of the&s;e mountains, and they had a&s;&s;umed a blue tint &s;o peculiar and clear, that they appeared upon the &s;ky, like &s;upernatural tran&s;parencies.</P>
<P>We had heard, at Bonn, of the Capuchins' courte&s;y, and had no he&s;itation to knock at their gate, after taking &s;ome re&s;t in the portico of the church, from whence we looked down another &s;ide of the mountain, over the long plains between Bonn and Cologne. Having waited &s;ome time at the gate, during which many &s;teps fled along the pa&s;&s;age and the head of a monk appeared peeping through a window above, a &s;ervant admitted us into a parlour, adjoining the refectory, which appeared to have been ju&s;t left. This was the fir&s;t convent we had entered, and we could not help expecting to &s;ee more than others had de&s;cribed; an involuntary habit, from which few are free, and which need not be imputed to vanity, &s;o long as the love of &s;urpri&s;e &s;hall be &s;o vi&s;ible in human pur&s;uits. When the lay-brother had quitted us, to inform the &s;uperior of our re|que&s;t, not a foot&s;tep, or a voice approached, for near a quarter of an hour, and the place &s;eemed as if uninhabited. Our curio&s;ity had no indulgence within the room, which was of the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s,
<PB N="125" REF="133">
and that plainne&s;s free from any thing, that the mo&s;t tractable ima|gination could &s;uppo&s;e peculiar to a convent. At length, a monk appeared, who received us with infinite good humour, and with the ea&s;e which mu&s;t have been acquired in more general &s;ociety. His &s;haven head and black garments formed a whim&s;ical contra&s;t to the character of his per&s;on and countenance, which bore no &s;ymptoms of &s;orrow, or penance, and were, indeed, animated by an air of cheer|fulne&s;s and intelligence, that would have become the happie&s;t inha|bitant of the gaye&s;t city.</P>
<P>Through &s;ome &s;ilent pa&s;&s;ages, in which he did not &s;hew us a cell and we did not perceive another monk, we pa&s;&s;ed to the church, where the favour of &s;everal Electors has a&s;&s;i&s;ted the di&s;play of paintings, marble, &s;culpture, gold and &s;ilver, mingled and arranged with magni|ficent effect. Among the&s;e was the marble &s;tatue, brought from England, at a great expence, and here called a repre&s;entation of St. Anne, who is &s;aid to have found the Cro&s;s. Our conductor &s;eemed to be a man of good under&s;tanding and de&s;irous of being thought &s;o; a di&s;po&s;ition, which gave an awkwardne&s;s to his manner, when, in noticing a relic, he was obliged to touch upon &s;ome unproved and unimportant tradition, peculiar to his church and not e&s;&s;ential to the lea&s;t article of our faith. His &s;en&s;e of decorum as a member of the convent &s;eemed then to be &s;truggling with his vanity, as a man.</P>
<P>But there are relics here, pretending to a connection with &s;ome parts of chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, which it is &s;hocking to &s;ee introduced to
<PB N="126" REF="134">
con&s;ideration by any means &s;o trivial and &s;o liable to ridicule. It is, indeed, wonderful, that the ab&s;urd exhibitions, made in Romi&s;h churches, &s;hould &s;o often be minutely de&s;cribed, and dwelt upon in terms of ludicrous exultation by tho&s;e, who do not intend that mo&s;t malignant of offences again&s;t human nature, the endeavour to excite a wretched vanity by &s;arca&s;m and je&s;t, and to employ it in eradi|cating the comforts of religion. To &s;uch writers, the probable mi&s;chief of uniting with the mention of the mo&s;t important divine doctrines the mo&s;t ridiculous of human impo&s;itions ought to be apparent; and, as the ri&s;k is unnece&s;&s;ary in a Prote&s;tant country, why is it encountered? That per&s;ons otherwi&s;e inclined &s;hould adopt the&s;e topics is not &s;urpri&s;ing; the ea&s;ie&s;t pretences to wit are found to be made by means of familiar allu&s;ions to &s;acred &s;ubjects, becau&s;e their nece&s;&s;ary incongruity accompli&s;hes the greate&s;t part of what, in other ca&s;es, mu&s;t be done by wit it&s;elf; there will, therefore, never be an end of &s;uch allu&s;ions, till it is generally &s;een, that they are the re&s;ources and &s;ymptoms of mean under&s;tandings, urged by the feveri&s;h de&s;ire of an eminence, to which they feel them&s;elves inadequate.</P>
<P>From the chapel we a&s;cended to a tower of the convent, whence all the &s;cattered &s;cenes, of who&s;e beauty, or &s;ublimity, we had caught partial glimp&s;es between the woods below, were collected into one va&s;t land&s;cape, and exhibited almo&s;t to a &s;ingle glance. The point, on which the convent &s;tands, commands the whole horizon. To the north, &s;pread the wide plains, before &s;een, covered with corn,
<PB N="127" REF="135">
then ju&s;t embrowned, and with vines and gardens, who&s;e alternate colours formed a gay checker work with villages, convents and ca&s;tles. The grandeur of this level was unbroken by any inclo&s;ures, that could &s;eem to dimini&s;h its va&s;tne&s;s. The range of woody heights, that bound it on the we&s;t, extend to the &s;outhward, many leagues beyond the hill <HI>Sanctae Cruois;</HI> but the uniform and unbroken ridges of di&s;tant mountains, on the ea&s;t, cea&s;e before the Seven Mountains ri&s;e above the Rhine in all their awful maje&s;ty. The ba&s;es of the latter were yet concealed by the woody ridge near the convent, which gives &s;uch enchanting effect to their aerial points. The &s;ky above them was clear and glowing, un&s;tained by the lighte&s;t vapour; and the&s;e mountains &s;till appeared upon it, like un&s;ub&s;tantial vi&s;ions. On the two highe&s;t pinnacles we could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the ruins of ca&s;tles, and, on a lower precipice, a building, which our reverend guide pointed out as a convent, dedicated to St. Bernard, giving us new occa&s;ion to admire the fine ta&s;te of the monks in their choice of &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the Seven Mountains, the plains of Goode&s;berg are &s;creened by the chain of hills already mentioned, which begin in the neighbourhood of Cologne, and who&s;e woods, &s;preading into France, there a&s;&s;ume the name of the Fore&s;t of Ardennes. Within the rece&s;&s;es of the&s;e woods the Elector has a hunting-&s;eat, almo&s;t every window of which opens upon a different alley, and not a &s;tag can cro&s;s the&s;e without being &s;een from the chateau. It is melancholy to con&s;ider, that the mo&s;t frequent motives of man's retirement among the beauti|ful
<PB N="128" REF="136">
rece&s;&s;es of nature, are only tho&s;e of de&s;troying the innocent ani|mals that inhabit her &s;hades. Strange! that her lovely &s;cenes can|not &s;often his heart to milder plea&s;ures, or elevate his fancy to nobler pur&s;uits, and that he mu&s;t &s;till &s;eek his amu&s;ement in &s;cattering death among the harmle&s;s and the happy.</P>
<P>As we afterwards walked in the garden of the convent, the greater part of which was planted with vines, the monk further exhibited his good humour and liberality. He enquired concerning the events of the war, of which he appeared to know the late&s;t; &s;poke of his friends in Cologne and other places; drew a ludicrous picture of the effect which would be produced by the appearance of a capuchin in Lon|don, and laughed immoderately at it. <Q REND="inline">"There,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"it would be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome harlequin was walking in a capuchin's dre&s;s to attract &s;pectators for a pantomime; here nobody will follow him, left he &s;hould lead them to church. Every nation has its way, and laughs at the ways of others. Con&s;idering the effects, which differ|ences &s;ometimes have, there are few things more innocent than that &s;ort of laughter."</Q></P>
<P>The garden was &s;tored with fruits and the vegetable luxuries of the table, but was laid out with no attention to beauty, its inimitable pro&s;pects having, as the good monk &s;aid, rendered the &s;ociety care|le&s;s of le&s;s advantages. After exchanging our thanks for his civilities again&s;t his thanks for the vi&s;it, we de&s;cended to Poppel&s;dorff by a &s;teep road, bordered with firs and fragrant &s;hrubs, which frequently opened to corn lands and vineyards, where pea&s;ants were bu&s;ied in dre&s;&s;ing the vines.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="137">
About a mile from Bonn is a garden, or rather nur&s;ery, to which they have given the name of <HI>Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">xhall.</HI> It is much more rural than that of London, being planted with thick and lofty groves, which, in this climate, are gratefully refre&s;hing, during the &s;ummer-day, but are very pernicious in the evening, when the vapour, ari&s;ing from the ground, cannot e&s;cape through the thick foliage. The garden is lighted up only on great fe&s;tivals, or when the Elector or his courtiers give a ball in a large room built for the purpo&s;e. On &s;ome days, half the inhabitants of Bonn are to be &s;een in this garden, mingling in the promenade with the Elector and his nobility; but there were few vi&s;itors when we &s;aw it. Count GIMNICH, the com|mander, who had &s;urrendered Mentz to the French, was the only per&s;on pointed out to us.</P>
<P>The road from hence to Bonn was laid out and planted with pop|lars at the expence of the Elector, who has a ta&s;te for works of pub|lic advantage and ornament. His Grand-ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Teutonic Order renders his Court more frequented than tho&s;e of the other eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Princes, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of that Order being &s;till con&s;iderable enough to &s;upport many younger brothers of noble families. Having pa&s;&s;ed his youth in the army, or at the courts of Vienna or Bru&s;&s;els, he is al&s;o environed by friends, made before the vacancy of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical electorate induced him to change his profe&s;&s;ion, and the union of his three incomes, as Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter, Grand Ma&s;ter and Elector, enables him to &s;pend &s;omething more than two hundred thou&s;and pounds annually. His experience and revenues are, in many
 <PB N="130" REF="138">
re&s;pects, very u&s;efully employed. To the nobility he affords an example of &s;o much per&s;onal dignity, as to be able to reject many o&s;tentatious cu&s;toms, and to remove &s;ome of the ceremonial barriers, which men do not con&s;tantly place between them&s;elves and their fel|low-beings, except from &s;ome con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of per&s;onal weakne&s;s. All &s;overeigns, who have had any &s;en&s;e of their individual liberty and power, have &s;hewn a readine&s;s to remove &s;uch barriers; but not many have been able to effect &s;o much as the Elector of Cologne again&s;t the chamberlains, pages, and other footmanry of their courts, who are always upon the <HI>alerte</HI> to defend the fal&s;e magnificence that makes their offices &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary. He now enjoys many of the ble&s;&s;ings, u&s;ual only in private &s;tations; among others, that of con|ver&s;ing with great numbers of per&s;ons, not forced into his &s;ociety by their rank, and of di&s;pen&s;ing with much of that attendance, which would render his menial &s;ervants part of his company.</P>
<P>His &s;ecretary, Mr. Floret, whom we had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee, gave us &s;ome accounts of the indu&s;try and carefulne&s;s of his private life, which he judiciou&s;ly thought were better than any other panegyrics upon his ma&s;ter. His attention to the relief, em|ployment and education of the poor, to the &s;tate of manufactures and the encouragement of talents, appears to be continual; and his country would &s;oon have elap&s;ed from the general wretchedne&s;s of Germany, if the exertions of three campaigns had not de&s;troyed what thirty years of care and improvement cannot re&s;tore.</P>
<P>His re&s;idence at Bonn occa&s;ions expenditure enough to keep the
<PB N="131" REF="139">
people bu&s;y, but he has not been able to divert to it any part of the commerce, which, though it is of &s;o little u&s;e at Cologne, is here &s;poken of with &s;ome envy, and &s;eems to be e&s;timated above its amount. The town, which is much neater than the others in the electorate, and &s;o plea&s;antly &s;ituated, that its name has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be formed from the Latin &s;ynonym for good, is ornamented by few public buildings, except the palace. What is called the Univer|&s;ity is a &s;mall brick building, u&s;ed more as a &s;chool than a college, except that the ma&s;ters are called profe&s;&s;ors. The principal church of four, which are within the walls, is a large building, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;everal &s;pires, but not remarkable for its antiquity or beauty.</P>
<P>Many of the German powers retain &s;ome &s;hew of a repre&s;entative government, as to affairs of finance, and have States, by which taxes are voted. Tho&s;e of the electorate of Cologne con&s;i&s;t of four colleges, repre&s;enting the clergy, nobility, knights and cities; the votes are given by colleges, &s;o that the inhabitants of the cities, if they elect their repre|&s;entatives fairly, have one vote in four. The&s;e States a&s;&s;emble at Bonn.</P>
<P>One of the privileges, which it is &s;urpri&s;ing that the pre&s;ent Elector &s;hould retain, is that of grinding corn for the con&s;umption of the whole town. His mill, like tho&s;e of all the towns on the Rhine, is a floating one, moored in the river, which turns its wheel. Bread is bad at Bonn; but this oppre&s;&s;ive privilege is not entirely an&s;werable for it, there being little better throughout the whole country. It generally appears in rolls, with glazed cru&s;ts, half hollow; the crumb not brown, but a &s;ort of dirty white.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="140">
There are few cities in Germany without walls, which, when the dreadful &s;cience of war was le&s;s advanced than at pre&s;ent, frequently protected them again&s;t large armies. The&s;e are now &s;o u&s;ele&s;s, that &s;uch cannon as are employed again&s;t batteries could probably not be fired from them without &s;haking their foundations. The fortifica|tions of Bonn are of this &s;ort; and, though they were doubtle&s;s bet|ter, when the Duke of Marlborough arrived before them, it is won|derful that they &s;hould have &s;u&s;tained a regular &s;iege, during which great part of the town was demoli&s;hed. The electorate of Cologne is, indeed, &s;o ill prepared for war, that it has not one town, which could re&s;i&s;t ten thou&s;and men for three days.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Bonn, whenever they regret the lo&s;s of their fortifications, &s;hould be reminded of the three &s;ieges, which, in the cour&s;e of thirty years, nearly de&s;troyed their city. Of the&s;e the fir&s;t was in 1673, when the Elector had received a French garri&s;on into it; but the re&s;i&s;tance did not then continue many days. It was in this &s;iege that the Prince of Orange, afterwards our honoured William the Third, had one of his few military &s;ucce&s;&s;es. In 1689, the French, who had lately defended it, returned to attack it; and, before they could &s;ubdue the &s;trong garri&s;on left in it by the Elector of Brandenburg, the palace and &s;everal public buildings were de|&s;troyed. The third &s;iege was commanded by the Duke of Marlbo|rough, and continued from the 24th of April to the 16th of May, the French being then the defenders, and the celebrated Cohorn one of the a&s;&s;ailants. It was not till fifteen years afterwards, that all the
<PB N="133" REF="141">
hou&s;es, demoli&s;hed in this &s;iege, could be re&s;tored by the efforts of the Elector Jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Elector maintains, in time of peace, about eight hun|dred &s;oldiers, which is the number of his contingent to the army of the Empire: in the pre&s;ent war he has &s;upplied &s;omewhat more than this allotment; and, when we were at Bonn, two thou&s;and recruits were in training. His troops wear the general uniform of the Empire, blue faced with red, which many of the Germanic &s;overeigns give only to their contingent troops, while tho&s;e of their &s;eparate e&s;tabli&s;h|ments are di&s;tingui&s;hed by other colours. The Au&s;trian regiments are chiefly in white, faced with light blue, grey, or red; but the artillery are dre&s;&s;ed, with very little &s;hew, in a cloak &s;peckled with light brown.</P>
<P>Bonn was one of the very few places in Germany, which we left with regret. It is endeared to the votaries of land&s;cape by its &s;itua|tion in the mid&s;t of fruitful plains, in the pre&s;ence of &s;tupendous mountains, and on the bank of a river, that, in &s;ummer, is impelled by the di&s;&s;olved &s;nows of Switzerland, and, in winter, rolls with the accumulation of a thou&s;and torrents from the rocks on its &s;hores. It contained many inhabitants, who had the independence to aim at a ju&s;t ta&s;te in morals and letters, in &s;pite of the ill examples with which &s;uch countries &s;upply them; and, having the vices of the form of government, e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, corrected by the moderation and imme|diate attention of the governor, it might be con&s;idered as a happy region in the mid&s;t of ignorance, inju&s;tice and mi&s;ery, and remem|bered
<PB N="134" REF="142">
like the green &s;pot, that, in an Arabian de&s;ert, cheers the &s;en&s;es and &s;u&s;tains the hopes of the weary traveller.</P>

<HEAD>GOODESBERG.</HEAD>
<P>THE ride from Bonn to this delightful village is only one league over a narrow plain, covered with corn and vineyards. On our right was the range of hills, before &s;een from the mountain SANCTAE CRUCIS, &s;weeping into frequent rece&s;&s;es, and &s;tarting for|ward into promontories, with inequalities, which gave exqui&s;ite rich|ne&s;s to the fore&s;t, that mantled from their ba&s;es to their utmo&s;t &s;um|mits. Many a lurking village, with its &s;lender grey &s;teeple, peeped from among the woody &s;kirts of the&s;e hills. On our left, the tremen|dous mountains, that bind the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Rhine, gradually lo&s;t their a&euml;rial complexion, as we approached them, and di&s;played new features and new enchantments; an ever-varying illu&s;ion, to which the tran&s;ient circum&s;tance of thunder clouds contributed. The &s;un-beams, &s;treaming among the&s;e clouds, threw partial gleams upon the precipices, and, followed by dark &s;hadows, gave &s;urpri&s;ing and inimitable effect to the natural colouring of the mountains, who&s;e pointed tops we now di&s;cerned to be covered with dark heath, extended down their rocky &s;ides, and mingled with the reddi&s;h and light yellow tints of other vegetation and the &s;oil. It was delightful to watch the &s;hadows &s;weeping over the&s;e &s;teeps, now involving them
<PB N="135" REF="143">
in deep ob&s;curity, and then leaving them to the &s;un's rays, which brought out all their hues into vivid contra&s;t.</P>
<P>Near Goode&s;berg, a &s;mall mountain, in&s;ulated, abrupt and pyra|midal, ri&s;es from the plain, which it &s;eems to terminate, and conceals the village, that lies along its &s;outhern &s;kirt. This mountain, covered with vineyards and thick dwarf wood to its &s;ummit, where one high tower and &s;ome &s;hattered walls appear, is a very intere&s;ting object.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the village, the road was ob&s;tructed by a great number of &s;mall carts, filled with &s;oldiers apparently wounded. The line of their proce&s;&s;ion had been broken by &s;ome carriages, ha&s;tening with company to the ridotto at Goode&s;berg, and was not ea&s;ily re&s;tored. Mi&s;ery and fe&s;tivity could &s;carcely be brought into clo&s;er contra&s;t. We thought of John&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"many-coloured life,"</Q> and of his picture, in the preface to Shake&s;peare, of cotemporary wretchedne&s;s and joy, when <Q REND="inline">"the reveller is ha&s;tening to his wine, and the mourner is burying his friend."</Q> This was a proce&s;&s;ion of wounded French pri&s;oners, chiefly boys, who&s;e appearance had, indeed, led us to &s;u&s;pect their nation, before we &s;aw the &s;tamp of the <HI>fa&s;ces,</HI> and the words <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Republique Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e</HI>"</Q> upon the buttons of &s;ome, whom our driver had nearly over&s;et. The few, that could rai&s;e them&s;elves above the floor of their carts, &s;hewed countenances yellow, or livid with &s;ickne&s;s. They did not talk to their guards, nor did the latter &s;hew any &s;igns of exultation over them.</P>
<P>In a plain, beyond the village, a row of large hou&s;es, built upon one plan, and almo&s;t re&s;embling a palace, form the little watering
<PB N="136" REF="144">
place of Goode&s;berg, which has been founded partly at the expence of the Elector, and partly by individuals under his patronage. One of the hou&s;es was occupied by the Archduche&s;s, his &s;i&s;ter, and is often u&s;ed by the Elector, who is extremely &s;olicitous for the pro&s;perity of the place. A large building at the end contains the public rooms, and is fitted up as an hotel.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this hou&s;e is beautiful beyond any hope or power of de&s;cription; for de&s;cription, though it may tell that there are mountains and rocks, cannot paint the grandeur, or the elegance of outline, cannot give the effect of precipices, or draw the minute fea|tures, that reward the actual ob&s;erver by continual changes of colour, and by varying their forms at every new choice of his po&s;ition. Delightful Goode&s;berg! the &s;ublime and beautiful of land&s;cape, the charms of mu&s;ic, and the plea&s;ures of gay and elegant &s;ociety, were thine! The immediate unhappine&s;s of war has now fallen upon thee; but, though the graces may have fled thee, thy terrible maje&s;ty remains, beyond the &s;phere of human contention.</P>
<P>The plain, that contains the village and the Spa, is about five miles in length and of half that breadth. It is covered by unin|clo&s;ed corn and nearly &s;urrounded by a va&s;t amphitheatre of moun|tains. In front of the inn, at the di&s;tance of half a league, extend, along the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the Rhine, the Seven Mountains, &s;o long &s;een and admired, which here a&s;&s;ume a new attitude. The three talle&s;t points are now neare&s;t to the eye, and the lower mountains are &s;een either in the per&s;pective between them, or &s;inking, with
<PB N="137" REF="145">
le&s;s abrupt declivities, into the plains, on the north. The whole ma&s;s exhibits a grandeur of outline, &s;uch as the pencil only can de&s;cribe; but fancy may paint the &s;tupendous precipices of rock, that ri&s;e over the Rhine, the rich tuftings of wood, that embo&s;s the cliffs or lurk within the rece&s;&s;es, the &s;piry &s;ummits and the ruined ca&s;tles, faintly di&s;cerned, that crown them. Yet the appearance of the&s;e mountains, though more grand, from Goode&s;berg, is le&s;s &s;ublime than from Bonn; for the nearne&s;s, which increa&s;es their grandeur, dimini&s;hes their &s;ublimity by removing the ob&s;curity that had veiled them. To the &s;outh of this plain, the long per&s;pective is cro&s;&s;ed by further ranges of mountains, which open to glimp&s;es of others &s;till beyond; an endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ummits, that lead on the imagination to unknown vallies and regions of &s;olitary ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t &s;o many attractions of nature, art cannot do much. The little, which it attempts, at Goode&s;berg, is the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome walks from the hou&s;es to a &s;pring, which is &s;aid to re&s;emble that at Spa, and through the woods above it. Twice a week there are &s;ome mu&s;ical performances and a ball given by the Elector, who frequently appears, and with the ea&s;e and plainne&s;s of a private gen|tleman. At the&s;e entertainments the company, vi&s;iting the &s;pring, are joined by neighbouring families, &s;o as to be in number &s;ixty, or a hundred. The balls, agreeably to the earline&s;s of German hours, begin at &s;ix; and that, which we meant to &s;ee, was nearly concluded before our arrival. The company then retired to a public
<PB N="138" REF="146">
game, at which large &s;ums of gold were ri&s;ked, and a &s;evere anxiety defied the influence of Mozart's mu&s;ic, that continued to be played by an excellent orche&s;tra. The dre&s;&s;es of the company were in the Engli&s;h ta&s;te, and, as we were glad to believe, chiefly of Engli&s;h manufacture; the wearing of countenances by play appears to be al&s;o according to our manners, and the German ladies, with features &s;carcely le&s;s elegant, have complexions, perhaps, finer than are gene|ral in England.</P>
<P>Meditating cen&s;ures again&s;t the Elector's policy, or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, in this re&s;pect, we took advantage of the la&s;t gleams of evening, to a&s;cend the &s;lender and &s;piry mountain, which bears the name of the village, and appears ready to precipitate the ruins of its antient ca&s;tle upon it. A &s;teep road, winding among vineyards and dwarf wood, enters, at the &s;ummit of the mountain, the broken walls, which &s;urround the ancient citadel of the ca&s;tle; an almo&s;t &s;olid building, that has exi&s;ted for more than five centuries. From the area of the&s;e ruins we &s;aw the &s;un &s;et over the whole line of plains, that extend to the we&s;tward of Cologne, who&s;e &s;pires were di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible. Bonn, and the hill SANCTAE CRUCIS, appeared at a league's di&s;tance, and the windings of the Rhine gleamed here and there amid&s;t the rich &s;cene, like di&s;tant lakes. It was a &s;till and beautiful evening, in which no &s;hade remained of the thunder clouds, that pa&s;&s;ed in the day. To the we&s;t, under the glow of &s;un-&s;et, the land&s;cape melted into the horizon in tints &s;o &s;oft, &s;o clear, &s;o deli|cately ro&s;eate as Claude only could have painted. Viewed, as we then

&s;aw it, beyond a deep and dark arch of the ruin, its effect was en|chanting; it was to the eye, what the fine&s;t &s;trains of Pai&s;iello are to the heart, or the poetry of Collins is to the fancy&mdash;all tender, &s;weet, elegant and glowing.</P>
<P>From the other &s;ide of the hill the character of the view is entirely different, and, in&s;tead of a long pro&s;pect over an open and level country, the little plain of Goode&s;berg appears repo&s;ing amid&s;t wild and awful mountains. The&s;e were now melancholy and &s;ilent; the la&s;t rays were fading from their many points, and the ob&s;curity of twilight began to &s;pread over them. We &s;eemed to have found the &s;pot, for which Collins wi&s;hed:<Q><L>"Now let me rove &s;ome wild and heathy &s;cene,</L>
<L>Or find &s;ome ruin 'mid&s;t its dreary dells,</L>
<L>Who&s;e walls more awful nod</L>
<L>By thy religious gleams."</L>
<BIBL>ODE TO EVENING.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And this is a place almo&s;t as renowned in the hi&s;tory of the country, as it is worthy to exerci&s;e the powers of poetry and paint|ing. The &s;ame Erne&s;t, in the cau&s;e of who&s;e &s;overeignty the ma&s;&s;a|cre of Neu&s;s was perpetrated, be&s;ieged here the &s;ame Gerard de Tru&s;ches, the Elector, who had embraced the Prote&s;tant religion, and for whom Neu&s;s held out. The ca&s;tle of Goode&s;berg was impreg|nable, except by famine, but was very liable to that from its in&s;u|lated &s;ituation, and the ea&s;e, with which the whole ba&s;e of the
<PB N="140" REF="148">
mountain could be &s;urrounded. Gerard's defence was rendered the more ob&s;tinate by his belief, that nothing le&s;s than his life, and that of a beautiful woman, the marrying of whom had con&s;tituted one of the offences again&s;t his Chapter, would appea&s;e his ferocious ene|mies. He was per&s;onally beloved by his garri&s;on, and they adhered to him with the affection of friends, as well as with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;oldiers. When, therefore, they perceived, that their &s;urrender could not be much longer protracted, they re&s;olved to employ their remaining time and &s;trength in enabling him to &s;eparate his for|tunes from theirs. They laboured ince&s;&s;antly in forming a &s;ubter|raneous pa&s;&s;age, which &s;hould open beyond the be&s;iegers' lines; and, though their di&s;tre&s;s became extreme before this was completed, they made no overtures for a &s;urrender, till Gerard and his wife had e&s;caped by it. The fugitives arrived &s;afely in Holland, and the vengeance of their adver&s;aries was never gratified further than by hearing, many years after, that they died poor.</P>
<P>The fortre&s;s, rendered intere&s;ting by the&s;e traits of fidelity and misfortune, is not &s;o far decayed, but that its remains exhibit much of its original form. It covered the whole &s;ummit of the hill, and was valuable as a re&s;idence, as well as a fortification. What &s;eem to have been the walls of the great hall, in which probably the horn of two quarts was often emptied to welcome the gue&s;t, or reward the &s;oldier, are &s;till perfect enough to pre&s;erve the arches of its capacious win|dows, and the door-ways, that admitted its fe&s;tive trains. The va&s;t &s;trength of the citadel has been un&s;ubdued by war, or time. Though
<PB N="141" REF="149">
the battlements, that crown it, are broken, and of a gallery, that once encircled it half way from the ground, the corbells alone remain, the &s;olid walls of the building it&s;elf are unimpaired. At the narrow door-way, by which only it could be entered, we mea&s;ured their thickne&s;s, and found it to be more than ten feet, nearly half the diameter of its area. There has never been a fixed &s;tairca&s;e, though the&s;e walls would &s;o well have contained one; and the hole is &s;till perfect in the floor above, through which the garri&s;on a&s;cended and drew up their ladder after them. Behind the loop-holes, the wall has been hollowed, and would permit a &s;oldier, half bent, to &s;tand within them and u&s;e his bow. It was twilight without and night within the edifice; which fancy might have ea&s;ily filled with the &s;tern and &s;ilent forms of warriors, waiting for their prey, with the patience of &s;afety and &s;ure &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>We wandered long among the&s;e ve&s;tiges of ancient &s;tory, rendered &s;till more intere&s;ting by the &s;hadowy hour and the ve&s;per bell of a chapel on a cliff below. The village, to which this belongs, &s;traggles half way up the mountain, and there are &s;everal little &s;hrines above it, which the cottagers, on fe&s;tivals, decorate with flowers. The Prie&s;t is the &s;choolma&s;ter of the pari&s;h, and almo&s;t all the children, within &s;everal miles of the hill, walk to it, every day, to prayers and le&s;&s;ons. Whether it is from this care of their minds, or that they are under the authority of milder landlords than el&s;ewhere, the manners of the inhabitants in this plain differ much from tho&s;e, u&s;ual in Germany. In&s;tead of an inveterate &s;ullenne&s;s, approaching frequently to malig|nity,
<PB N="142" REF="150">
they &s;hew a civility and gentlene&s;s in their intercour&s;e with &s;trangers, which leave the enjoyments derived from inanimate nature, unalloyed by the remembrances of human deformity, that mingle with them in other di&s;tricts. Even the children's begging is in a manner, which &s;hews a different character. They here ki&s;s their little hands, and &s;ilently hold them out to you, almo&s;t as much in &s;alute, as in entreaty; in many parts of Germany their manner is &s;o offen&s;ive, not only for its intru&s;ion, but as a &s;ymptom of their di&s;po|&s;ition, that nothing but the remembrance of the oppre&s;&s;ion, that pro|duces it, can prevent you from denying the little they are compelled to require.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic had not cea&s;ed, when we returned to the inn; and the mellowne&s;s of French horns, mingled with the tenderne&s;s of haut|boys, gave a kind of enchantment to the &s;cenery, which we con|tinued to watch from our windows. The oppo&s;ite mountains of the Rhine were gradually vani&s;hing in twilight and then as gradually re-appearing, as the ri&s;ing moon threw her light upon their broken &s;urfaces. The per&s;pective in the ea&s;t received a &s;ilvery &s;oftne&s;s, which made its heights appear like &s;hadowy illu&s;ions, while the nearer mountains were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their colouring, as much as by their forms. The broad Rhine, at their feet, rolled a &s;tream of light for their boundary, on this &s;ide. But the fir&s;t exqui&s;ite tint of beauty &s;oon began to fade; the mountains became mi&s;ty underneath the moon, and, as &s;he a&s;cended, the&s;e mi&s;ts thickened, till they veiled the land&s;cape from our view.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="151">
The &s;pring, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome medicinal qualities, is about a quarter of a mile from the rooms, in a woody valley, in which the Elector has laid out &s;everal roads and walks. It ri&s;es in a &s;tone ba&s;on, to which the company, if they wi&s;h to drink it on the &s;pot, de&s;cend by an hand&s;ome flight of &s;teps. We were not told its qualities, but there is a ferrugineous tint upon all the &s;tones, which it touches. The ta&s;te is &s;lightly unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The three &s;uperior points of the Seven Mountains, which contri|bute &s;o much to the di&s;tinction of Goode&s;berg, are called Draken|fels, Wolkenbourg and Lowenbourg, and have each been crowned by its ca&s;tle, of which two are &s;till vi&s;ible in ruins. There is a &s;tory faintly recorded, concerning them. Three brothers, re&s;olving to found three di&s;tingui&s;hed families, took the method, which was anciently in u&s;e for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, that of e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in fortre&s;&s;es, from whence they could i&s;&s;ue out, and take what they wanted from their indu&s;trious neighbours. The pinnacles of Dra|kenfels, Wolkenbourg and Lowenbourg, which, with all a&s;&s;i&s;tance, cannot be a&s;cended now, without the utmo&s;t fatigue, were inacce&s;|&s;ible, when guarded by the ca&s;tles, built by the three brothers. Their depredations, which they called &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war, enriched their families, and placed them among&s;t the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in the empire.</P>
<P>They had a &s;i&s;ter, named Adelaide, famed to have been very beau|tiful; and, their parents being dead, the care of her had de&s;cended to them. Roland, a young knight, who&s;e ca&s;tle was on the oppo&s;ite
<PB N="144" REF="152">
bank of the Rhine, became her &s;uitor, and gained her affections. Whether the brothers had expected, by her means, to form a more &s;plendid alliance, or that they remembered the ancient enmity be|tween their family and that of Roland, they &s;ecretly re&s;olved to deny the hand of Adelaide, but did not choo&s;e to provoke him by a direct refu&s;al. They &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould &s;erve, a certain num|ber of years, in the war of Pale&s;tine, and, on his return, &s;hould be permitted to renew his &s;uit.</P>
<P>Roland took a reluctant farewell of Adelaide, and went to the war, where he was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed for an impetuous career. Adelaide remained in the ca&s;tle of Drakenfels, waiting, in &s;olitary fidelity, for his return. But the brothers had determined, that he &s;hould not return for her. They clothed one of their dependents in the di&s;gui&s;e of a pilgrim, and introduced him into the ca&s;tle, where he related, that he was arrived from the holy wars, and had been de&s;ired by Roland in his late&s;t moments to a&s;&s;ure Adelaide of his having loved her till death.</P>
<P>The unhappy Adelaide believed the tale, and, from that time, devoted her&s;elf to the memory of Roland and to the nouri&s;hment of her &s;orrow. She rejected all the &s;uitors, introduced by her brothers, and accepted no &s;ociety, but that of &s;ome neighbouring nuns. At length, the gloom of a cloi&s;ter became &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the melancholy of her imagination, that &s;he re&s;olved to found a con|vent and take the veil; a de&s;ign, which her brothers a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with the view of placing her effectually beyond the reach of her lover.
<PB N="145" REF="153">
She cho&s;e an i&s;land in the Rhine between her brother's ca&s;tle and the &s;eat of Roland, both of which &s;he could &s;ee from the windows of her convent; and here &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in the placid per|formance of her new duties.</P>
<P>At length, Roland returned, and they both di&s;covered the cruel device, by which they had been &s;eparated for ever. Adelaide remained in her convent, and &s;oon after died; but Roland, emu|lating the fidelity of her retirement, built, at the extreme point of his domains towards the Rhine, a &s;mall ca&s;tle, that over|looked the i&s;land, where he wa&s;ted his days in melancholy regret, and in watching over the walls, that &s;hrouded his Adelaide.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tory, on which the wild and vivid imagination of Ario&s;to is &s;aid to have founded his Orlando.</P>

<HEAD>THE VALLEY OF ANDERNACH.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;pending part of two days at Goode&s;berg, we &s;et out, in a &s;ultry afternoon, for the town of Andernach, di&s;tant about five-and-twenty Engli&s;h miles. The road wound among corn|lands towards the Rhine, and approached almo&s;t as near to the Seven Mountains, as the river would permit. Oppo&s;ite to the la&s;t, and nearly the talle&s;t of the&s;e, called Drakenfels, the open plain termi|nates, and the narrower valley begins.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="154">
This mountain towers, the maje&s;tic &s;entinel of the river over which it a&s;pires, in va&s;t ma&s;&s;es of rock, varied with rich tuftings of dwarf|wood, and bearing on its narrow peak the remains of a ca&s;tle, who&s;e walls &s;eem to ri&s;e in a line with the perpendicular precipice, on which they &s;tand, and, when viewed from the oppo&s;ite bank, appear little more than a rugged cabin. The eye aches in attempting to &s;cale this rock; but the &s;ublimity of its height and the grandeur of its inter|mingled cliffs and woods gratify the warme&s;t wi&s;h of fancy.</P>
<P>The road led us along the we&s;tern bank of the Rhine among vine|yards, and corn, and thick trees, that allowed only tran&s;ient catches of the water between their branches; but the gigantic form of Draken|fels was always &s;een, its &s;uperior features, perhaps, appearing more wild, from the partial concealment of its ba&s;e, and a&s;&s;uming new atti|tudes as we pa&s;&s;ed away from it. Lowenberg, who&s;e upper region only had been &s;een from Goode&s;berg, &s;oon unfolded it&s;elf from be|hind Drakenfels, and di&s;played all its pomp of wood, &s;weeping from the &s;preading ba&s;e in one uninterrupted line of grandeur to the &s;piry top, on which one high tower of the ca&s;tle appears enthroned among the fore&s;ts. This is the loftie&s;t of the Seven Mountains; and its dark &s;ides, where no rock is vi&s;ible, form a fine contra&s;t with the broken cliffs of Drakenfels. A multitude of &s;piry &s;ummits appeared beyond Lowenberg, &s;een and lo&s;t again, as the nearer rocks of the &s;hore opened to the di&s;tance, or re-united. About a mile further, lies the plea&s;ant i&s;land, on which Adelaide rai&s;ed her convent. As it was well endowed, it has been rebuilt, and is now a large and hand|&s;ome
<PB N="147" REF="155">
quadrangle of white &s;tone, &s;urrounded with trees, and corn, and vineyards, and &s;till allotted to the &s;ociety, which &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed. An abrupt, but not lofty rock, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the Rhine, called Rolands Eck, or Roland's Corner, is the &s;ite of her lover's ca&s;tle, of which one arch, picture&s;quely &s;hadowed with wood, is all that remains of this monument to faithful love. The road winds beneath it, and nearly overhangs the narrow channel, that &s;eparates Adelaide's i&s;land from the &s;hore. Concerning this rock there is an ancient rhyme in the country, amounting to &s;omething like the following:
<Q><L>Was not Roland, the knight, a &s;trange &s;illy wight,</L>
<L>For the love of a nun, to live on this height?</L></Q></P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;land, the valley contracts, and the river is &s;oon &s;hut up between fruitful and abrupt hills, which ri&s;e immediately over it, on one &s;ide, and a &s;eries of rocky heights on the other. In the &s;mall &s;pace, left between the&s;e heights and the Rhine, the road is formed. For the greater part of the way, it has been hollowed in the &s;olid rock, which a&s;cends almo&s;t perpendicularly above it, on one hand, and &s;inks as abruptly below it, to the river, on the other; a work worthy of Roman per&s;everance and de&s;ign, and well known to be a monument of both. It was made during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus; and as the in&s;cription, who&s;e antiquity has not been doubted, dates its completion in the year 162, it mu&s;t have been fini&s;hed in one year, or little more, Marcus Aurelius having
<PB N="148" REF="156">
been rai&s;ed to the purple in 161. The Elector Palatine having re|paired this road, which the Electors of Cologne had neglected, in 1768, has cau&s;ed his name to be joined with tho&s;e of the Roman Emperors, in the following in&s;cription upon an obli&s;k: <Q>VIAM <LB>SUB M. <LB>AURELIO <LB>ET L. VERO <LB>I. M. P. P. <LB>ANNO CHR. <LB>CLXII <LB>MUNITAM <LB>CAROLUS <LB>THEODORUS <LB>ELECTOR PAL. <LB>DUX BAV. JUL. CL. M. <LB>REFECIT <LB>ET AMPLIAVIT <LB>AN. M. DCCLXVIII <LB>CURANTE JO. LUD. COMITE <LB>DE GOLDSTEIN <LB>PRO PRINCIPE.</Q></P>
<P>We did not &s;ufficiently ob&s;erve the commencement and conclu|&s;ion of this road, to be certain of its exact length; but it is probably about twelve miles. The rock above is, for the mo&s;t part, naked to the &s;ummit, where it is thinly covered with earth; but &s;ometimes it &s;lopes &s;o much as to permit patches of &s;oil on its &s;ide, and the&s;e are
<PB N="149" REF="157">
carefully planted with vines. This &s;hore of the Rhine may be &s;aid to be bounded, for many miles, by an immen&s;e wall of rock, through which the openings into the country behind are few; and the&s;e breaks &s;hew only deep glens, &s;een and lo&s;t again &s;o quickly, that a woody mountain, or a ca&s;tle, or a convent, were the only objects we could a&s;certain.</P>
<P>This rock lies in oblique <HI>&s;trata,</HI> and re&s;embles marble in its brown and reddi&s;h tints, marked with veins of deeper red; but we are unable to mention it under its proper and &s;cientific denomination. The colouring of the cliffs is beautiful, when mingled with the verdure of &s;hrubs, that &s;ometimes hang in rich drapery from their points, and with the mo&s;&s;es, and creeping vegetables of bright crim&s;on, yellow, and purple, that embo&s;s their fractured &s;ides.</P>
<P>The road, which the Elector mentions him&s;elf to have widened, is now and then very narrow, and approaches near enough to the river, over which it has no parapet, to make a traveller anxious for the &s;obriety and &s;kill of his po&s;tillion. It is &s;ometimes elevated forty feet above the level of the Rhine, and &s;eldom le&s;s than thirty; an ele|vation from whence the water and its &s;cenery are viewed to great advantage; but to the variety and grandeur of the&s;e &s;hores, and the ever changing form of the river, de&s;cription cannot do ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Sometimes, as we approached a rocky point, we &s;eemed going to plunge into the expan&s;e of water beyond; when, turning the &s;harp angle of the promontory, the road &s;wept along an ample bay, where the rocks, receding, formed an amphitheatre, covered with <HI>ilex</HI> and
<PB N="150" REF="158">
dwarf-wood, round a narrow, but cultivated level &s;tripe: then, wind|ing the furthe&s;t angle of this cre&s;cent, under huge cliffs, we &s;aw the river beyond, &s;hut in by the folding ba&s;es of more di&s;tant promonto|ries, a&s;&s;ume the form of a lake, amid&s;t wild and romantic land&s;capes. Having doubled one of the&s;e capes, the pro&s;pect opened in long per|&s;pective, and the green waters of the Rhine appeared in all their maje&s;ty, flowing rapidly between ranges of marbled rocks, and a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of woody &s;teeps, and overlooked by a multitude of &s;piry &s;um|mits, which di&s;tance had &s;weetly coloured with the blue and purple tints of air.</P>
<P>The retro&s;pect of the river, too, was often enchanting, and the Seven Mountains long maintained their dignity in the &s;cene, &s;uperior to many intervening heights; the dark &s;ummit of Lowenburg, in particular, appeared, for &s;everal leagues, overlooking the whole valley of the Rhine.</P>
<P>The ea&s;tern margin of the river &s;ometimes exhibited as exten&s;ive a range of &s;teep rocks as the we&s;tern, and frequently the fitne&s;s of the &s;alient angles on one &s;ide, to the recipient ones on the other, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the &s;peculation, that they had been divided by an earth|quake, which let the river in between them. The general &s;tate of the ea&s;tern bank, though &s;teep, is that of the thicke&s;t cultivation. The rock frequently peeps, in rugged projections, through the thin &s;oil, which is &s;cattered over its declivity, and every where appears at top; but the &s;ides are covered with vines &s;o abundantly, that the labour of cultivating them, and of expre&s;&s;ing the wine, &s;upports a
<PB N="151" REF="159">
village at lea&s;t at every half mile. The green rows are led up the &s;teeps to an height, which cannot be a&s;cended without the help of &s;teps cut in the rock: the &s;oil it&s;elf is there &s;upported by walls of loo&s;e &s;tones, or it would fall either by its own weight, or with the fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ure of rain; and &s;ometimes even this &s;canty mould appears to have been placed there by art, being in &s;uch &s;mall patches, that, perhaps, only twenty vines can be planted in each. But &s;uch exce&s;|&s;ive labour has been nece&s;&s;ary only towards the &s;ummits, for, lower down, the &s;oil is &s;ufficiently deep to &s;upport the mo&s;t luxuriant vege|tation.</P>
<P>It might be &s;uppo&s;ed from &s;o much produce and exertion, that this bank of the Rhine is the re&s;idence of an opulent, or, at lea&s;t, a well|conditioned pea&s;antry, and that the villages, of which &s;even or eight are frequently in &s;ight at once, are as &s;uperior to the neighbouring towns by the &s;tate of their inhabitants, as they are by their pictu|re&s;que &s;ituation. On the contrary, the inhabitants of the wine country are &s;aid to be among&s;t the poore&s;t in Germany. The value of every hill is exactly watched by the landlords, &s;o that the tenants are very &s;eldom benefited by any improvement of its produce. If the rent is paid in money, it leaves only &s;o much in the hands of the farmer as will enable him to live, and pay his workmen; while the attention of a great number of &s;tewards is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;upply what might be expected from his attention, had he a common intere&s;t with his landlord in the welfare of the e&s;tate. But the rent is fre|quently paid in kind, amounting to a &s;ettled proportion of the pro|duce;
<PB N="152" REF="160">
and this proportion is &s;o fixed, that, though the farmer is immoderately di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a bad vintage, the be&s;t will not afford him any means of approaching to independence. In other countries it might be a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"But, though we can &s;uppo&s;e the ingenuity of the landlord to be greater than that of the tenant, at the commencement of a bargain, how happens it, that, &s;ince the re&s;ult mu&s;t be felt, the tenant will remain under his burthens, or can be &s;ucceeded by any other, on &s;uch terms?"</Q> Here, however, the&s;e que&s;tions are not appli|cable; they pre&s;ume a choice of &s;ituations, which the country does not afford. The &s;everity of the agricultural &s;y&s;tem continues it&s;elf by continuing the poverty, upon which it acts; and tho&s;e, who would e&s;cape from it find few manufactures and little trade to em|ploy them, had they the capital and the education nece&s;&s;ary for either. The choice of &s;uch per&s;ons is between the being a ma&s;ter of day-labourers for their landlord, or a labourer under other ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e e&s;tates belong immediately to Princes, or Chapters, who&s;e &s;tewards &s;uperintend the cultivation, and are them&s;elves in&s;tead of the farmers, &s;o that all other per&s;ons employed in &s;uch vineyards are ordinary &s;ervants. By one or other of the&s;e means it happens, that the bounteou&s;ne&s;s of nature to the country is very little felt by the body of the inhabitants. The payment of rents in kind is u&s;ual, wherever the vineyards are mo&s;t celebrated; and, at &s;uch places, there is this &s;ure proof of the wretchedne&s;s of the inhabitants, that, in a month after the wine is made, you cannot obtain one bottle of the true produce, except by favour of the proprietors, or their &s;tewards.
<PB N="153" REF="161">
How much is the delight of looking upon plenteou&s;ne&s;s le&s;&s;ened by the belief, that it &s;upplies the means of exce&s;s to a few, but denies tho&s;e of competence to many!</P>
<P>Between this pa&s;s of cultivated &s;teeps on one &s;ide of the river, and of romantic rocks on the other, the road continues for &s;everal miles. Being thus commanded on both &s;ides, it mu&s;t be one of the mo&s;t dif|ficult pa&s;&s;ages in Europe to an enemy, if re&s;olutely defended. The Rhine, pent between the&s;e impenetrable boundaries, is con&s;iderably narrower here than in other parts of the valley, and &s;o rapid, that a loaded ve&s;&s;el can &s;eldom be drawn fa&s;ter than at the rate of &s;ix Engli&s;h miles a day, again&s;t the &s;tream. The pa&s;&s;age down the river from Mentz to Cologne may be ea&s;ily performed in two days; that from Cologne to Mentz requires a fortnight.</P>
<P>The view along this pa&s;s, though bounded, is various and change|ful. Villages, vineyards and rocks alternately ornament the borders of the river, and every fifty yards enable the eye to double &s;ome ma&s;&s;y projection that concealed the fruitful bay behind. An object at the end of the pa&s;s is pre&s;ented &s;ingly to the &s;ight as through an inverted tele&s;cope. The &s;urface of the water, or the whole &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene, was very &s;eldom interrupted by the pa&s;&s;ing of a boat; carriages were &s;till fewer; and, indeed, throughout Germany, you will not meet more than one in twenty miles. Travelling is con&s;i|dered by the natives, who know the fatigue of going in carriages nearly without &s;prings, and &s;topping at inns where there is little of either accommodation or civility, as productive of no plea&s;ure; and
<PB N="154" REF="162">
they have &s;eldom curio&s;ity or bu&s;ine&s;s enough to recompen&s;e for its inconveniencies.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through two or three &s;mall towns, who&s;e ruined gates and walls told of their antiquity, and that they had once been held of &s;ome con&s;equence in the defence of the valley. Their pre&s;ent de&s;o|lation formed a melancholy contra&s;t with the cheerful cultivation around them. The&s;e, however, with every village in our way, were decorated with green boughs, planted before the door of each cot|tage, for it was a day of fe&s;tival. The little chapels at the road-&s;ide, and the image, which, every now and then, appeared under a &s;pread|ing tree, were adorned with wreaths of fre&s;h flowers; and though one might &s;mile at the emblems of &s;uper&s;tition, it was impo&s;&s;ible not to reverence the &s;entiment of pious affection, which had adju&s;ted the&s;e &s;imple ornaments.</P>
<P>About half-way to Andernach, the we&s;tern rocks &s;uddenly recede from the river, and, ri&s;ing to greater height, form a grand &s;weep round a plain cultivated with orchards, garden-fields, corn and vine|yards. The valley here &s;preads to a breadth of nearly a mile and an half, and exhibits grandeur, beauty and barren &s;ublimity, united in a &s;ingular manner. The abrupt &s;teeps, that ri&s;e over this plain, are entirely covered with wood, except that here and there the ravage of a winter torrent appeared, which could &s;ometimes be traced from the very &s;ummit of the acclivity to the ba&s;e. Near the centre, this noble amphitheatre opens to a glen, that &s;hews only wooded moun|tains, point above point, in long per&s;pective; &s;uch &s;ylvan pomp we
<PB N="155" REF="163">
had &s;eldom &s;een! But though the tuftings of the nearer woods were beautifully luxuriant, there &s;eemed to be few timber trees among&s;t them. The oppo&s;ite &s;hore exhibited only a range of rocks, varie|gated like marble, of which purple was the predominating tint, and uniformly di&s;po&s;ed in va&s;t, oblique &s;trata. But even here, little green patches of vines peeped among the cliffs, and were led up crevices where it &s;eemed as if no human foot could re&s;t. Along the ba&s;e of this tremendous wall, and on the points above, villages, with each its tall, grey &s;teeple, were thickly &s;trewn, thus mingling in &s;triking con|tra&s;t the cheerfulne&s;s of populous inhabitation with the horrors of untamed nature. A few mona&s;teries, re&s;embling ca&s;tles in their extent, and known from &s;uch only by their &s;pires, were di&s;tingui&s;h|able; and, in the widening per&s;pective of the Rhine, an old ca&s;tle it&s;elf, now and then, appeared on the &s;ummit of a mountain &s;ome|what remote from the &s;hore; an object rendered &s;weetly picture&s;que, as the &s;un's rays lighted up its towers and fortified terraees, while the &s;hrubby &s;teeps below were in &s;hade.</P>
<P>We &s;aw this land&s;cape under the happie&s;t circum&s;tances of &s;ea&s;on and weather; the woods and plants were in their mid&s;ummer bloom, and the mellow light of evening heightened the richne&s;s of their hues, and gave exqui&s;ite effect to one half of the amphitheatre we were pa&s;&s;ing, while the other half was in &s;hadow. The air was &s;cented by bean-blo&s;&s;oms, and by lime-trees then in flower, that bordered the road. If this plain had mingled pa&s;ture with its groves, it would have been truly Arcadian; but neither here, nor through the whole
<PB N="156" REF="164">
of this delightful valley, did we &s;ee a &s;ingle pa&s;ture or meadow, except now and then in an i&s;land on the Rhine; deficiencies which are here &s;upplied, to the lover of land&s;cape, by the verdure of the woods and vines. In other parts of Germany they are more to be regretted, where, frequently, only corn and rock colour the land.</P>
<P>Fatigued at length by &s;uch prodigality of beauty, we were glad to be &s;hrouded awhile from the view of it, among clo&s;e boughs, and to &s;ee only the wide rivulets, with their ru&s;tic bridges of faggots and earth, that, de&s;cending from among the mountains, frequently cro&s;&s;ed our way; or the &s;imple pea&s;ant-girl, leading her cows to feed on the narrow &s;tripe of gra&s;s that margined the road. The little bells, that jingled at their necks, would not &s;uffer them to &s;tray beyond her hearing. If we had not long &s;ince di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;carcity and bad quality of chee&s;e and butter in Germany, we &s;hould have done &s;o now, on perceiving this &s;canty method of pa&s;turing the cattle, which future ob&s;ervation convinced us was the frequent practice.</P>
<P>About &s;un-&s;et we reached the little village of Namedy, &s;eated near the foot of a rock, round which the Rhine makes a &s;udden &s;weep, and, contracted by the bold precipices of Hammer&s;tein on the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore, its green current pa&s;&s;es with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity and &s;ounding &s;trength. The&s;e circum&s;tances of &s;cenery, with the tall ma&s;ts of ve&s;&s;els lying below the &s;hrubby bank, on which the village &s;tands, and &s;eeming to heighten by compari&s;on the &s;tupendous rocks, that ro&s;e around them; the moving figures of boatmen and hor&s;es
<PB N="157" REF="165">
employed in towing a barge again&s;t the &s;tream, in the bay beyond; and a group of pea&s;ants on the high quay, in the fore ground, watching their progre&s;s; the ancient ca&s;tle of Hammer&s;tein over|looking the whole&mdash;the&s;e were a combination of images, that formed one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting pictures we had &s;een.</P>
<P>The valley again expanding, the walls and turrets of Andernach, with its Roman tower ri&s;ing independently at the foot of a moun|tain, and the ruins of its ca&s;tle above, appeared athwart the per&s;pec|tive of the river, terminating the pa&s;s; for there the rocky boun|dary opened to plains and remote mountains. The light vapour, that ro&s;e from the water, and was tinged by the &s;etting rays, &s;pread a purple haze over the town and the cliffs, which, at this di&s;tance appeared to impend over it; colouring extremely beautiful, contra&s;ted as it was by the clearer and deeper tints of rocks, wood and water nearer to the eye.</P>
<P>As we approached Andernach, its &s;ituation &s;eemed to be perpe|tually changing, with the winding bank. Now it appeared &s;eated on a low penin&s;ula, that nearly cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, overhung by roman|tic rocks; but this vi&s;ion vani&s;hed as we advanced, and we per|ceived the town lying along a curving &s;hore, near the foot of the cliffs, which were finely fringed with wood, and at the entrance of exten&s;ive plains. Its towers &s;een afar, would be &s;igns of a con|&s;iderable place, to tho&s;e who had not before been wearied of &s;uch &s;ymptoms by the towers of Neu&s;s, and other German towns. From a wooded precipice over the river we had &s;oon after a fine retro&s;pec|tive
<PB N="158" REF="166">
glimp&s;e of the valley, its fanta&s;tic &s;hores, and long mountainous di&s;tance, over which evening had drawn her &s;weete&s;t colouring. As we pur&s;ued the pa&s;s, the heights on either hand gradually &s;oftened; the country beyond &s;hewed remote mountains le&s;s wild and a&s;piring than tho&s;e we had left, and the blooming tint, which had inve&s;ted the di&s;tance, deepened to a du&s;ky purple, and then vani&s;hed in the gloom of twilight. The progre&s;&s;ive influence of the hour upon the land&s;cape was intere&s;ting; and the &s;hade of evening, under which we entered Andernach, harmonized with the de&s;olation and &s;ilence of its old walls and the broken ground around them. We pa&s;&s;ed a drawbridge and a ruinous gateway, and were &s;ufficiently fatigued to be &s;omewhat anxious as to our accommodation. The Engli&s;h habit of con&s;idering, towards the end of the day's journey, that you are not far from the cheerful reception, the ready attendance, and the conveniences of a &s;ub&s;tantial inn, will &s;oon be lo&s;t in Germany. There, in&s;tead of being in good &s;pirits, during the la&s;t &s;tage, from &s;uch a pro&s;pect, you have to con&s;ider, whether you &s;hall find a room, not ab&s;olutely di&s;gu&s;ting, or a hou&s;e with any eatable provi&s;ion, or a landlady, who will give it you, before the delay and the fatigue of an hundred reque&s;ts have rendered you almo&s;t incapable of receiv|ing it. When your carriage &s;tops at the inn, you will perhaps per|ceive, in&s;tead of the alacrity of an Engli&s;h waiter, or the civility of an Engli&s;h landlord, a huge figure, wrapt in a great coat, with a red wor&s;ted cap on his head, and a pipe in his mouth, &s;talking before the door. This is the landlord. He makes no alteration in his pace
<PB N="159" REF="167">
on perceiving you, or, if he &s;tops, it is to eye you with curio&s;ity; he &s;eldom &s;peaks, never bows, or a&s;&s;i&s;ts you to alight; and perhaps &s;tands &s;urrounded by a troop of &s;lovenly girls, his daughters, whom the &s;ound of wheels has brought to the door, and who, as they lean indolently again&s;t it, gaze at you with rude curio&s;ity and &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>The drivers in Germany are all bribed by the innkeepers, and, either by affecting to mi&s;under&s;tand you, or otherwi&s;e, will con&s;tantly &s;top at the door, where they are be&s;t paid. That this money comes out of your pocket the next morning is not the grievance; the evil is, that the wor&s;t inns give them the mo&s;t, and a traveller, unle&s;s he exactly remembers his directions, is liable to be lodged in all the vile&s;t rooms of a country, where the be&s;t hotels have no lodging &s;o clean and no larder &s;o whole&s;omely filled as tho&s;e of every half-way hou&s;e between London and Canterbury. When you are within the inn, the landlord, who is eager to keep, though not to accommodate you, will affirm, that his is the inn you a&s;k for, or that the other &s;ign is not in the place; and, as you &s;oon learn to believe any thing of the wretchedne&s;s of the country, you are unwilling to give up one lodging, le&s;t you &s;hould not find another.</P>
<P>Our driver, after pa&s;&s;ing a de&s;olate, half filled place, into which the gate of Andernach opened, entered a narrow pa&s;&s;age, which after|wards appeared to be one of the chief &s;treets of the place. Here he found a mi&s;erable inn, and declared that there was no other; but, as we had &s;een one of a much better appearance, we were at length
<PB N="160" REF="168">
brought to that, and, though with &s;ome delay, were not ill accommodated, for the night.</P>
<P>Andernach is an ancient town, and it is believed, that a tower, which &s;tands alone, at one end of the walls, was built by Dru&s;us, of whom there are many traces in walls and ca&s;tles, intended to defend the colonies, on this &s;ide of the Rhine, again&s;t the Germans, on the other. The fortifications can now be of little other u&s;e than to authori&s;e the toll, which travellers pay, for entering a walled town; a tax, on account of which many of the walls are &s;upported, though it is pretended, that the tax is to &s;upport the walls. By their means al&s;o, the Elector of Cologne collects here the la&s;t of four pay|ments, which he demands for the privilege of pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine from Urdingen to Andernach; and this is the mo&s;t Southern frontier town of his dominions on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Rhine, which &s;oon after join tho&s;e of the Elector of Treves. Their length from hence to Rheinberg is not le&s;s than ninety miles; the breadth pro|bably never more than twenty.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome trade, at Andernach, in tiles, timber, and mill-&s;tones, but the heaps of the&s;e commodities upon the beach are the only vi&s;ible &s;ymptoms of the traffick; for you will not &s;ee one per&s;on in the place moving as if he had bu&s;ine&s;s to attract him, or one &s;hop of a better appearance, than an Engli&s;h huck&s;ter's, or one man in the dre&s;s of a creditable trader, or one hou&s;e, which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to per&s;ons in ea&s;y circum&s;tances. The port contains, perhaps, half a dozen ve&s;&s;els, clinker built, in &s;hape between a barge and a
<PB N="161" REF="169">
&s;loop; on the quay, you may &s;ee two or three fellows, harne&s;&s;ing half a dozen hor&s;es to a tow line, while twenty more watch their lingering manoeuvres, and this may probably be the morning's bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the town. Tho&s;e, who are concerned in it, &s;ay that they are engaged in <HI>commerce.</HI></P>
<P>This, or &s;omething like it, is the condition, as to trade, of all the towns we &s;aw in Germany, one or two excepted. They are &s;o far from having well filled, or &s;pacious repo&s;itories, that you can &s;carcely tell at what hou&s;es there are any, till you are led within the door; you may then wait long after you are heard, or &s;een, before the owner, if he has any other engagement, thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to ap|proach you: if he has what you a&s;k for, which he probably has not, unle&s;s it is &s;omething very ordinary, he tells the price and takes it, with as much &s;ullenne&s;s, as if you were forcing the goods from him: if he has not, and can &s;hew you only &s;omething very different, he then con&s;iders your enquiry as an intru&s;ion, and appears to think him&s;elf injured by having had the trouble to an&s;wer you. What &s;eems unaccountable in the manners of a German trader, is, that, though he is &s;o carele&s;s in attending you, he looks as much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as vexed, if you do not leave &s;ome money with him; but he probably knows, that you can be &s;upplied no where el&s;e in the town, and, therefore, will not deny him&s;elf the indulgence of his temper. Even when you are &s;atisfied, his manner is &s;o ill, that he appears to con&s;i|der you his dependent, by wanting &s;omething which he can refu&s;e. After perceiving, that this is nearly general, the pain of making con|tinual
<PB N="162" REF="170">
di&s;coveries of idlene&s;s and malignity becomes &s;o much greater than the inconvenience of wanting any thing &s;hort of nece&s;&s;aries, that you decline going into &s;hops, and wait for &s;ome ea&s;ier oppor|tunities of &s;upplying whatever you may lo&s;e upon the road.</P>

<P>IT is one po&s;t from Andernach hither, over a road, as good as any in England. Beyond the dominions of the Elector of Cologne, the face of the country, on this &s;ide of the Rhine, entirely changes its character. The rocks cea&s;e, at Andernach, and a rich plain commences, along which the road is led, at a greater di&s;tance from the Rhine, through corn lands and uninclo&s;ed orchards. About a mile from Andernach, on the other &s;ide of the river, the white town of Neuwiedt, the capital of a &s;mall Prote&s;tant principality, is &s;een; and the general report, that it is one of the mo&s;t commercial places, on the Rhine, appeared to be true from the chearful neatne&s;s of the principal &s;treet, which faces towards the water. There were al&s;o about twenty &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, lying before it, and the quay &s;eemed to be wide enough to &s;erve as a &s;pacious terrace to the hou&s;es. The Prince's palace, an exten&s;ive &s;tone building, with a lofty orangery along the &s;hore, is at the end of this &s;treet, which, as well as the greate&s;t part of the town, was built, or improved under the au&s;pices of his father; a wi&s;e prince, di&s;tingui&s;hed by having negotiated, in
<PB N="163" REF="171">
1735, a peace between the Empire and France, when the continu|ance of the war had &s;eemed to be inevitable. The &s;ame benevo|lence led him to a voluntary &s;urrender of many oppre&s;&s;ive privileges over his &s;ubjects, as well as to the mo&s;t careful protection of com|merce and manufactures. Accordingly, the town of Neuwiedt has been continually increa&s;ing in pro&s;perity and &s;ize, for the la&s;t fifty years, and the inhabitants of the whole principality are &s;aid to be as much more qualified in their characters as they are happier in their conditions than tho&s;e of the neighbouring &s;tates. But then there is the <HI>wretchedne&s;s</HI> of a deficiency of game in the country, for the late Prince was guilty of &s;uch an innovation as to mitigate the &s;eve|rity of the laws re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>The fore&s;t hills, that ri&s;e behind Neuwiedt and over the rocky margin of the river, extend them&s;elves towards the more rugged mountains of Wetteravia, which are &s;een, a &s;hapele&s;s multitude, in the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The river is &s;oon after lo&s;t to the view between high, &s;edgy banks; but, near Coblentz, the broad bay, which it makes in conjunction with the Mo&s;elle, is &s;een expanding between the walls of the city and the huge pyramidal precipice, on which &s;tands the fortre&s;s of Ehrenbreit|&s;tein, or rather which is it&s;elf formed into that fortre&s;s. The Mo&s;elle is here a noble river, by which the &s;treams of a thou&s;and hills, cover|ed with vines, pour them&s;elves into the Rhine. The antient &s;tone bridge over it leads to the northern gate of Coblentz, and the en|trance into the city is ornamented by &s;everal large chateau-like man|&s;ions,
<PB N="164" REF="172">
erected to command a view of the two rivers. A narrow &s;treet of high, but antient hou&s;es then commences, and runs through the place. Tho&s;e, which branch from it extend, on each &s;ide, to|wards the walls, immediately within which there are others, that nearly follow their cour&s;e and encompa&s;s the city. Being built be|tween two rivers, its form is triangular, and only one &s;ide is entirely open to the land; a &s;ituation &s;o convenient both for the purpo&s;es of commerce and war, that it could not be overlooked by the Romans, and was not much neglected by the moderns, till the indu&s;try of maritime countries and the complicated con&s;titution of the Empire reduced Germany in the &s;cale of nations. This was accordingly the &s;tation of the fir&s;t legion, and the union of the two rivers gave it a name; <HI>Confluentia.</HI> At the commencement of the modern divi&s;ion of nations, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Charlemagne frequently re&s;ided here, for the convenience of an intercour&s;e between the other parts of the Empire and France; but, in the eleventh century, the whole territory of Treves regained the di&s;tinction, as a &s;eparate country, which the Romans had given it, by calling the inhabitants <HI>Treveri.</HI></P>
<P>Coblentz is a city of many &s;pires, and has e&s;tabli&s;hments of chap|ters and mona&s;teries, which make the great pride of German capitals, and are &s;ometimes the chief objects, that could di&s;tingui&s;h them from the neglected villages of other countries. The &s;treets are not all nar|row, but few of them are &s;traight; and the &s;ame pavement &s;erves for the hor&s;es of the Elector and the feet of his &s;ubjects. The port, or beach, has the appearance of &s;omething more bu&s;ine&s;s than that of
<PB N="165" REF="173">
Andernach, being the re&s;ort of pa&s;&s;age-ve&s;&s;els between Mentz and Cologne; but the broad quay, which has been rai&s;ed above it, is chiefly u&s;eful as a promenade to the vi&s;itors of a clo&s;e and gloomy town. Beyond the terrace &s;tands the Elector's palace, an elegant and &s;pacious &s;tone edifice, built to the height of three &s;tories, and inclo&s;ing a court, which is large enough to be light as well as mag|nificent. The front towards the Rhine is &s;imple, yet grand, the few ornaments being &s;o well proportioned to its &s;ize, as neither to deba&s;e it by minutene&s;s, nor encumber it by va&s;tne&s;s. An entablature, di&s;|playing &s;ome allegorical figures in bas relief, is &s;upported by &s;ix Doric columns, which contribute much to the maje&s;tic &s;implicity of the edifice. The palace was built, about ten years &s;ince, by the reigning Elector, who mentions, in an in&s;cription, his attention to the architectural art; and a fountain, between the building and the town, is in&s;cribed with a few words, which &s;eem to acknowledge his &s;ub|jects as beings of the &s;ame &s;pecies with him&s;elf; CLEMENS WIN|CESLAUS VICINIS SUIS.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;triking parts of the view from this quay are the rock and fortre&s;s of Ehrenbreit&s;tein, that pre&s;ent them&s;elves immediately before it, on the other &s;ide of the river; notwith&s;tanding the breadth of which they appear to ri&s;e almo&s;t perpendicularly over Coblentz. At the ba&s;e of the rock &s;tands a large building, formerly the palace of the Electors, who cho&s;e to re&s;ide under the immediate protection of the fortre&s;s, rather than in the mid&s;t of their capital. Adjoining it is the village of Ehrenbreit&s;tein, between which and Coblentz a
<PB N="166" REF="174">
flying bridge is continually pa&s;&s;ing, and, with its train of &s;ubordinate boats, forms a very picture&s;que object from the quay. The fortre&s;s it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal tier of low walls, built wherever there was a projection in the rock capable of &s;upporting them, or wherever the rock could be hewn &s;o as to afford room for cannon and &s;oldiers. The &s;tone, taken out of the ma&s;s, &s;erved for the formation of the walls, which, in &s;ome places, can &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the living rock. Above the&s;e tier, which are divided into &s;everal &s;mall parts, according to the conveniences afforded by the cliff, is built the ca&s;tle, or citadel, covering its &s;ummit, and &s;urrounded by walls more regularly continued, as well as higher. Small towers, &s;omewhat in the antient form, defend the ca&s;tle, which would be of little value, except for its height, and for the gradations of batteries between it and the river. Thus protected, it &s;eems impregnable on that &s;ide, and is &s;aid to be not much weaker on the other; &s;o that the garri&s;on, if they &s;hould be willing to fire upon Coblentz, might make it impo&s;&s;ible for an enemy to remain within it, except under the cover of very high entrenchments. This is the real defence of the city, for its walls would pre&s;ently fall before heavy artillery; and this, it is believed, might be pre&s;erved as long as the garri&s;on could be &s;upplied with &s;tores.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the river from the quay to the fortre&s;s, by means of the very &s;imple invention, a flying bridge. That, by which part of the pa&s;&s;age of the Waal is made at Nimeguen, has been already men|tioned; this is upon the &s;ame principle, but on a much larger &s;cale.
<PB N="167" REF="175">
After the barges, upon which the platform is laid, are clear of the bank, the whole pa&s;&s;age is effected with no other labour than that of the rudder. A &s;trong cable, which is fa&s;tened to an anchor at each &s;ide of the river, is &s;upported acro&s;s it by a &s;eries of &s;mall boats; the bridge has two low ma&s;ts, one on each barge, and the&s;e are connected at the top by a beam, over which the cable is pa&s;&s;ed, being confined &s;o as that it cannot &s;lip beyond them. When the bridge is launched, the rapidity of the current forces it down the Rhine as far as the cable will permit: having reached that point, the force, received from the current, gives it the only direction of which it is capable, that acro&s;s the river, with the cable which holds it. The &s;teer&s;man manages two rudders, by which he a&s;&s;i&s;ts in giving it this direction. The voyage requires nine or ten minutes, and the bridge is conti|nually pa&s;&s;ing. The toll, which, for a foot pa&s;&s;enger, is &s;omething le&s;s than a penny, is paid, for the benefit of the Elector, at an office, on the bank, and a &s;entinel always accompanies the bridge, to &s;upport his government, during the voyage.</P>
<P>The old palace of Ehrenbreit&s;tein, de&s;erted becau&s;e of its damp|ne&s;s, and from the fear of its being overwhelmed by the rock, that &s;ometimes &s;catters its fragments upon it, is now u&s;ed as a barrack and ho&s;pital for &s;oldiers. It is a large building, even more plea&s;antly &s;itu|ated than the new one, being oppo&s;ite to the entrance of the Mo&s;elle into the Rhine; and its &s;tructure, which has been once magnificent, denotes &s;carcely any other decay, than all buildings will &s;hew, after a few years' neglect. The rock has allowed little room for a garden,
<PB N="168" REF="176">
but there are &s;ome ridiculous ornaments upon a very narrow &s;trip of ground, which was probably intended for one.</P>
<P>The only entrance into the fortre&s;s, on this &s;ide, is by a road, cut in the &s;olid rock, under four gateways. It is &s;o &s;teep, that we were compelled to decline the honour of admi&s;&s;ion, but a&s;cended it far enough to judge of the view, commanded from the &s;ummit, and to be behind the batteries, of which &s;ome were mounted with large bra&s;s cannon. Coblentz lies beneath it, as open to in&s;pection as a model upon a table. The &s;weeps of the Rhine and the meanders of the Mo&s;elle, the one binding the plain, the other inter&s;ecting it, lead the eye towards di&s;tant hills, that encircle the capacious level. The quay of the city, with the palace and the moving bridge, form an intere&s;t|ing picture immediately below, and we were unwilling to leave the rock for the dull and clo&s;e &s;treets of Coblentz. On our return, the extreme nakedne&s;s of the new palace, which is not &s;heltered by trees, on any &s;ide, withdrew our attention from the motley group of pa&s;&s;engers, mingled with hay carts and other carriages, on the flying bridge.</P>
<P>The long re&s;idence of the emigrant princes and noble&s;&s;e of France in this city is to be accounted for not by its general accommodations, or gaieties, of which it is nearly as deficient as the others of Germany; but fir&s;t by the great ho&s;pitality of the Elector towards them, and then by the convenience of its &s;ituation for receiving intelligence from France, and for communicating with other countries. The Elector held frequent levies for the French nobility, and continued for them

part of the &s;plendour which they had enjoyed in their own country. The readine&s;s for lending money upon property, or employments in France, was al&s;o &s;o great, that tho&s;e, who had not brought ca&s;h with them, were immediately &s;upplied, and tho&s;e, who had, were encou|raged to continue their u&s;ual expences. We know it from &s;ome of the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible authority, that, at the commencement of the march towards Longwy, money, at four per cent. was even pre&s;&s;ed upon many, and that large &s;ums were refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Here, and in the neighbourhood, between &s;ixty and &s;eventy &s;qua|drons of cavalry, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of tho&s;e who had formerly enjoyed military, or other rank, were formed; each per&s;on being mounted and equipped chiefly at his own expence. We heard &s;everal anec|dotes of the confidence, entertained in this army, of a &s;peedy arrival in Paris; but, as the per&s;ons, to whom they relate, are now under the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortune, there would be as little plea&s;ure, as propriety in repeating them.</P>
<P>At Coblentz, we quitted, for a time, the left bank of the Rhine, in order to take the watering place of Selters, in our way to Mentz. Having cro&s;&s;ed the river and a&s;cended a &s;teep road, near the fortre&s;s, we had fine glimp&s;es of its walls, ba&s;tions and out-towers, and the heathy knolls, around them, with catches of di&s;tant country. The way continued to lie through the dominions of the Elector of Treves, which are here &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for their wretchedne&s;s as to be named the <HI>Siberia of Germany!</HI> It is paved and called a <HI>chau&s;&s;&eacute;e;</HI> but tho&s;e, who have not experienced its ruggedne&s;s, can have no idea of it,

<HEAD>MONTABAUR.</HEAD>
<P>SIX hours after leaving Coblentz, we reached Montabaur, the fir&s;t po&s;t-town on the road, and di&s;tant about eighteen miles. An ancient chateau, not &s;trong enough to be a ca&s;tle, nor light enough to be a good hou&s;e, commands the town, and is probably the re&s;idence of the lord. The walls and gates &s;hew the antiquity of Montabaur, but the ruggedne&s;s of its &s;ite &s;hould &s;eem to prove, that there was no other place in the neighbourhood, on which a town could be built.

<HEAD>LIMBOURG.</HEAD>
<P>OVER a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fore&s;t mountains, &s;imilar to tho&s;e ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, we came, in the afternoon, to Limbourg, another po&s;t town, or, perhaps, city, and another collection of hou&s;es, like tombs, or for&s;aken ho&s;pitals. At an inn, called the Three Kings, we &s;aw fir&s;t the &s;ullenne&s;s and then the ferocious malignity of a German landlord and his wife, exemplified much more fully than had before occurred. When we afterwards expre&s;&s;ed our &s;urpri&s;e, that the magi&s;|trates &s;hould permit per&s;ons of &s;uch conduct to keep an inn, e&s;pecially where there was only one, we learned, that this fellow was him&s;elf the chief magi&s;trate, or burgoma&s;ter of the place; and his authority appeared in the fearfulne&s;s of his neighbours to afford any &s;ort of refre&s;hment to tho&s;e, who had left his inn. One of the Elector's mini|&s;ters, with whom we had the plea&s;ure to be acquainted, informed us, that he knew this man, and that he mu&s;t have been intoxicated, for that, though civil when &s;ober, he was madly turbulent and abu&s;ive, if otherwi&s;e. It appeared, therefore, that a per&s;on was permitted to be a magi&s;trate, who, to the knowledge of government, was expo&s;ed by his &s;ituation to be intoxicated, and was outrageous, whenever he was &s;o. So little is the order of &s;ociety e&s;timated here, when it is not con|nected with the order of politics.</P>
<P>Near Limbourg, the fore&s;t &s;cenery, which had &s;hut up the view,

during the day, di&s;appeared, and the country lo&s;t, at lea&s;t, an unifor|mity of &s;avagene&s;s. The hills continue, but they are partly culti|vated. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town, a &s;teep a&s;cent leads to a plain, on which a battle was fought, during the &s;hort &s;tay of the French in this di&s;trict, in the campaign of 1792.</P>
<P>Four thou&s;and French were advancing towards Limbourg; a &s;mall Pru&s;&s;ian corps drew up to oppo&s;e them, and the engagement, though &s;hort, was vivid, for the Pru&s;&s;ians did not perceive the &s;uperiority of the French in numbers, till the latter began to &s;pread upon the plain, for the purpo&s;e of &s;urrounding them. Being then compelled to retreat, they left &s;everal of the Elector's towns open to contribution, from which five-and-twenty thou&s;and florins were demanded, but the remon&s;trances of the magi&s;trates reduced this &s;um to 8000 florins, or about 700 l. The French then entered Limbourg, and extended them&s;elves over the neighbouring country. At Weilbourg, the re&s;i|dence of a Prince of the Hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au, they required 300,000 flo|rins, or 25,000 l. which the Prince neither had, nor could collect, in two days, through his whole country. All his plate, hor&s;es, coaches, arms and &s;ix pieces of cannon, were brought together, for the pur|po&s;e of removal; but afterwards two individuals were accepted as ho&s;tages, in&s;tead of the Prince him&s;elf, who had been at fir&s;t demanded. The action near Limbourg took place on the 9th of November, and, before the conclu&s;ion of the month, the French had fallen back to Franckfort, upon the re-approach of the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian troops.</P>

<HEAD>SELTERS.</HEAD>
<P>WE had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee this place, which, under the name of Seltzer, is &s;o celebrated throughout Europe, for its medi|cinal water. Though it is rather in the high road to Franckfort than to Mentz, there &s;eemed no probability of inconvenience in making this &s;hort departure from our route, when it was to be joined again from a place of &s;uch public acce&s;s as Selters appeared likely to be found.</P>
<P>About &s;even miles from Limbourg, a de&s;cent commences, at the bottom of which &s;tands this village. What a reproof to the expec|tations of comfort, or convenience in Germany! Selters, a &s;pot, to which a valetudinarian might be directed, with the pro&s;pect of his finding not only abundant accommodation, but many luxuries, Selters is literally and po&s;itively nothing more than an a&s;&s;emblage of mi&s;er|able cottages, with one inn and two hou&s;es for officers of the Elector, &s;tuck in a dirty pa&s;s, which more re&s;embles a ditch than a road. The village may be &s;aid to be near half a mile long, becau&s;e the huts, being mo&s;tly &s;eparated from each other, continue as far; and this length would increa&s;e its inconvenience to invalids, if &s;uch &s;hould ever &s;tay there longer than to &s;ee it, for there is nothing like a &s;wept path-way, and the road, in which they mu&s;t walk, is pro|bably always deeply covered with mud, being &s;o when we were there in the beginning of July. There was then, however, not one
<PB N="175" REF="183">
&s;tranger, be&s;ides our&s;elves, in the place, and we found, that very rarely any aggravate the mi&s;eries of &s;ickne&s;s by a &s;tay at Selters.</P>
<P>The only lodgings to be had are at the inn, and fortunately for travellers this is not &s;uch as might be expected from the appearance of the village. Finding there the novelty of an obliging ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s, we were very well contented to have reached it, at night, though we were to &s;tay there al&s;o the next day, being Sunday. The rooms are as good as tho&s;e in the inns of German cities, and three, which are called Court Chambers, having been u&s;ed by the Elector and lately by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, are better. The&s;e are as open as the others to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The &s;pring is at the foot of one of &s;everal hills, which imme|diately &s;urround the village, and is &s;eparated from the road by a &s;mall court yard. An oaken covering, at the height of ten or twelve feet, prevents rain from falling into the wooden ba&s;on, in which the &s;tream ri&s;es; and two or three of the Elector's guards watch over it, that no con&s;iderable quantity may be taken, without pay|ment of the duty, which forms a large part of his income. Many thou&s;ands of &s;tone bottles are piled round this court, and, for the reputation of the &s;pring, care is taken to fill them as immediately as po&s;&s;ible, before their removal for exportation.</P>
<P>The policy of keeping this income intire is &s;aid to be a motive for neglecting the condition of the village. A duty could not well be demanded of tho&s;e, who &s;hould drink at the &s;pring, but is ea&s;ily col|lected before the water is bottled for removal; it is, therefore, not
<PB N="176" REF="184">
wi&s;hed, that there &s;hould be many vi&s;itors, at Selters. We did not hear this rea&s;on upon the &s;pot, but it is difficult otherwi&s;e to account for a negligence, which prevents the inhabitants of the neighbouring country from being enriched at the expence of wanderers from others.</P>
<P>Nor is it only a duty, but the whole profit of the traffick, till the water leaves the place, which rewards the care of the Elector. His office for the &s;ale of it is e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and his agents alone tran&s;|mit it into foreign countries. The bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;ufficient to employ &s;everal clerks, and the number of bottles annually filled is &s;o im|men&s;e, that, having omitted to write it down, we will not venture to mention it from memory. The water is brought to table con&s;tantly and at an ea&s;y price in all the towns near the Rhine. Mixed with Rheni&s;h wine and &s;ugar it forms a delightful, but not always a &s;afe beverage, in hot weather. The acid of the wine, expelling the fixed air of other ingredients, occa&s;ions an efferve&s;cence, like that of Champagne, but the liquor has not a fourth part of the obnoxious &s;trength of the latter. The danger of drinking it is, that the acid may be too powerful for &s;ome con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>After being &s;urpri&s;ed by the de&s;olatene&s;s of the village, we were not le&s;s &s;o to find among&s;t its few inhabitants one, who&s;e manners and information, &s;o far from bearing the character of the drearine&s;s around him, were worthy of the be&s;t &s;ociety in the mo&s;t intelligent cities. This was the Commi&s;&s;ary and Privy Coun&s;ellor of the Elec|tor for the di&s;trict, who, having heard, that there were &s;ome Engli&s;h
<PB N="177" REF="185">
vi&s;itors at the well, very frankly introduced him&s;elf to us by his civilities, and favoured us with his company in the afternoon. He had been in England, with many valuable introductions, and had formed from the talents and accompli&s;hments of a di&s;tingui&s;hed Marquis an high opinion of the national character; a circum&s;tance, which probably united with his natural di&s;po&s;ition, in inducing him to emulate towards us the general politene&s;s of that truly honourable per&s;on.</P>
<P>When we enquired how the journey of the next day was to be performed, it appeared, that no other carriage could be hired in the place than a &s;ort of one-hor&s;e chair, which would take us to the next po&s;t town, from whence we might proceed with the u&s;ual chai&s;es. The driver walked at the &s;ide of this uncouth carriage, which had &s;hafts and wheels &s;trong enough for a waggon; and, either by the mi&s;take or intention of his ma&s;ter in directing him, we were led, not to the po&s;t town, for a chai&s;e, if it could be had, but entirely through a fore&s;t country to Mentz, by roads made only for the woodcutters, and, as it afterwards proved, known to few others, except to our inge|nious voiturier. We did not pa&s;s a town, or village, at which it was po&s;&s;ible to change the carriage, and had, therefore, no other alterna|tive, when the mi&s;take was di&s;covered, than to return to Selters, or to proceed to Mentz, in this inconvenient and ludicrous vehicle. We cho&s;e to proceed, and had &s;ome reward for fatigue, by pa&s;&s;ing nearly an whole day under the &s;hade of deep and delightful fore&s;ts, little tamed by the hand of man, and appearing to acknowledge only <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ea&s;on's difference."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="186">
Between Selters and the&s;e fore&s;ts, the country is well cultivated, and frequently laid out in garden fields, in which there was the fir&s;t appearance ofcheerful labour we had &s;een in Germany. After pa&s;&s;ing a &s;mall town, on the &s;ummit of a hill to the left, &s;till &s;ur|rounded by its antient fortifications, we entered a large plain, &s;kirted, on one &s;ide, by villages; another town, at the end of which, was almo&s;t the la&s;t &s;ign of an inhabited country, that appeared for &s;everal hours. The fore&s;t then commenced, and, with the exception of one hamlet, enveloped near the middle, we &s;aw nothing but lofty oaks, elms and che&s;nuts, till we emerged from it in the afternoon, and came to a town of the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt. Roebucks are &s;aid to be numerous, and wild boars not very &s;carce, in this fore&s;t; but we &s;aw none either here, or in tho&s;e near Limbourg, which are much inferior to this in beauty. Upon the whole, it was a &s;cene of per|fect novelty; without which it now &s;eems that we &s;hould have wanted many ideas of &s;ylvan life and much of the delight, excited by Shake&s;peare's exqui&s;ite de&s;cription of it.</P>

<HEAD>MENTZ,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH &s;tands in a &s;pacious plain, on the oppo&s;ite edge of the Rhine, and is vi&s;ible, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, with its ma&s;&s;y towers and numerous &s;pires. Within two or three miles of the city, the &s;ymptoms of ruin, occa&s;ioned by the &s;iege in 1793, began to appear. A village, on the left, had &s;carcely one hou&s;e entire; and the tower of the church was a mere wreck, blackened by flames, and with large cha&s;ms, that admitted the light. The road did not pa&s;s nearer to it than two miles, but the broken walls and roofs were di&s;tingui&s;hable even at that di&s;tance, and &s;ometimes a part, which had been repaired, contra&s;ted its colour with the black and &s;moky hues of the remainder. This was the village of Ko&s;theim, &s;o often contended for in the cour&s;e of the &s;iege, being on the oppo&s;ite bank of the Rhine to the city, and capable of ob&s;tructing the intercour&s;e with it by water.</P>
<P>The country on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the river was otherwi&s;e but little damaged, if we except the de&s;truction of numerous orchards; for the allies were not &s;trong enough to be&s;iege the city on all &s;ides at once, and contented them&s;elves with occupying &s;ome po&s;ts in this quarter, capable of holding the garri&s;on of Ca&s;&s;el in awe.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;&s;el is a &s;mall village exactly oppo&s;ite to Mentz, and com|municating with it by a bridge of boats. It was unfortified before
<PB N="180" REF="188">
the inva&s;ion of the French; but the&s;e had no &s;ooner entered the city, than they perceived the importance of &s;uch a place, and prepared them&s;elves to render it a regular fortre&s;s. In about two months they completely &s;urrounded it with earthen works and outworks, ditched and palli&s;adoed. Some of the neare&s;t orchards were cut down to be u&s;ed in the&s;e fortifications. The fruit trees &s;till remain with their branches upwards from the ditch, and &s;erve in&s;tead of <HI>chevaux de fri&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The village of Hockheim, which is al&s;o on this &s;ide of the Rhine, is further to the left than Ko&s;theim, and remains uninjured, at the top of the round and ea&s;y hill, the vines of which are &s;o much cele|brated for their flavour, as to give a name to great quantities of wine, produced in other di&s;tricts. After the &s;iege, the merchants of the neighbourhood enhanced the price of their &s;tocks by reporting, that all the vineyards had been de&s;troyed; but the truth is, that Hock|heim was not much contended for, and that little damage was done even to the crops then in bloom. The village is advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated about the confluence of the Rhine and the Maine, and, if it had been nearer the city, would probably have been &s;o important, as to have been conte&s;ted, till it was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>This is the home ground of the &s;cene, which &s;preads before the traveller, who approaches Mentz from the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Rhine. Furthe&s;t to the left is Hockheim, then the deva&s;tated village of Ko&s;theim, then the fortifications of Ca&s;&s;el, which, with the river, are between him and the city. Beyond, the horizon is bounded on
<PB N="181" REF="189">
all &s;ides by gradual hills, di&s;tant and apparently fruitful; but tho&s;e to the north are pre-eminent, with gentle &s;lopes at their feet, co|loured &s;weetly by corn, dark wood and gleams of reddi&s;h earth.</P>
<P>The works of Ca&s;&s;el render the approach to the city very tedious, for they have been &s;o contrived as that the road nearly follows them, in all their angles, for the purpo&s;e of being commanded by many points at once. The village was now garri&s;oned by Pru&s;&s;ians, of whom, &s;ome were lying under the &s;heds of their guard-hou&s;e near the bridge, and others were riding over it, with ju&s;t &s;peed enough to give one an idea of military earne&s;tne&s;s. Their hor&s;es &s;hook the floor of the bridge of boats, which here cro&s;&s;es the Rhine, at its breadth of nearly eight hundred feet, and di&s;turbed the promenade, for which it is u&s;ually frequented in an evening. We followed them, admiring the expan&s;e, and rapidity of the river more than the appearance of the city, where gloomine&s;s is too much mingled with grandeur; till, at the end of the bridge, we were &s;topped at another guard-hou&s;e, to an&s;wer the u&s;ual enquiries. A &s;oldier ac|companied us thence to a large &s;quare filled with cannon and mor|tars, where the captain of the guard examined our pa&s;&s;port. We were then very glad to pa&s;s the evening at an inn without further re&s;earches; but there were &s;ome &s;ymptoms of the late condition of the city to attract attention in the way.</P>
<P>The Elector's palace, which forms one &s;ide of this &s;quare, having been converted into an ho&s;pital by the French, is &s;till u&s;ed as &s;uch, or as a barrack, by the Pru&s;&s;ians; and the windows were crowded with
<PB N="182" REF="190">
the figures of half-dre&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers. Many of the cannon in the &s;quare remained with the fractures, made by the balls of the be|&s;iegers. This place communicates with a broad &s;treet, in which were many buildings, filled with &s;oldiers, and an hand&s;ome hou&s;e, that, having belonged to one of the Clubbi&s;ts, was de&s;troyed immediately after the expul&s;ion of the French. The walls &s;till remain bare and open. Some greater ruins, occa&s;ioned by fire, during the &s;iege, were vi&s;ible at a di&s;tance, and, upon the whole, we had intere&s;t enough excited, as to the immediate hi&s;tory of the place, to take little notice of the narrow and difficult pa&s;&s;ages, through which we wound for half an hour, after leaving the principal &s;treet.</P>
<P>The next morning, the friends, to whom we had letters, began to conduct us through the melancholy curio&s;ities, left in the city by the &s;iege. The&s;e are chiefly in the &s;outhern quarter, again&s;t which the direct attack of the allies was made, and their approaches mo&s;t advanced. Some entire &s;treets have been de&s;troyed here, and were &s;till in ruins. A magnificent church, attached to a convent of Fran|ci&s;can monks, is among the mo&s;t lamentable &s;pectacles; what was the roof now lies in heaps over the pavement; not a ve&s;tige of furniture, or decoration, has e&s;caped the flames, and there are cha&s;ms in the walls larger than the noble windows, that once illuminated them. This church and convent were &s;et on fire by a bomb; and of the &s;ick &s;oldiers, who were lodged in the latter, it is feared that but few were removed before the de&s;truction of the building. We next &s;aw the remains of a palace, built by the pre&s;ent Provo&s;t of the Chapter of
<PB N="183" REF="191">
Nobles; an in&s;titution, which is &s;o rich, that their Superior had a more elegant re&s;idence than the Elector. It was of &s;tone, and the principal front was in the Corinthian order, &s;ix columns of which &s;upported a &s;pacious open gallery, ornamented with &s;tatues, for its whole length. The wings formed two &s;ides of a &s;quare, which &s;epa|rated the palace from the &s;treet. A profu&s;ion of the riche&s;t furniture and a valuable collection of paintings filled the interior. Of the whole edifice little now remains but the &s;hattered walls of the centre, which have been &s;o &s;corched as to lo&s;e all appearance of having belonged to a &s;plendid &s;tructure. It was burnt the night before the fire of the Franci&s;can church, and two nights after the French had removed their head quarters and their municipality from it. On the day before the removal, a bomb had fallen upon the French General Blou, de&s;troying him on the &s;pot, and mortally wounding an officer, with whom he was conver&s;ing. The ruins are now &s;o accumulated over the court-yard, that we could not di&s;cern it to have ever had that appendage of a di&s;tingui&s;hed re&s;idence.</P>
<P>But the church of Notre Dame was the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of many ruined objects. The &s;teeple of this had been one of the grande&s;t ornaments of the city; a &s;hower of bombs &s;et fire to it; and, while it was thus rendered an ea&s;y mark for the be&s;iegers, their cannon played upon and beat a great part of it to the ground. By its fall the roof of the church was &s;hattered, but the body did not otherwi&s;e &s;uf|fer any material injury. Wooden galleries have been rai&s;ed round the remainder of the &s;teeple, not for the purpo&s;e of repairing, but for
<PB N="184" REF="192">
that of entirely removing it; and, to &s;ave the trouble of letting down the &s;tones on the out&s;ide, a wooden pipe, or channel has been made, through which they are lowered into the church. The appearance of this &s;teeple, which was once very large and lofty, is rendered &s;triking by the&s;e preparations for its total de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The whole church is built of a &s;tone, dug from the neighbouring hills, the colour of which is &s;o delicate a pink, that it might be &s;up|po&s;ed to be given by art. The Elector's palace and &s;everal other public buildings in the city are formed of this &s;tone.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through the gates on this &s;ide of Mentz, we came to a &s;lope near the river, and beyond the glacis of the place, which was then partly covered with huge ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone &s;cattered among the roots of broken trees and &s;hrubs, that had begun again to &s;hoot their ver|dure over the amputated trunks. This was the &s;ite of a palace of the Elector, called, both from the beauty of its &s;ituation, and the &s;plen|dour of its &s;tructure, La Favorita. The apartments of the palace and the terraces of the garden commanded exten&s;ive views of the Rhine and the &s;urrounding country a&s;cending from its banks; and the gar|dens them&s;elves were &s;o beautifully di&s;po&s;ed as to be thought worthy of the name of Engli&s;h. They were ornamented with pavilions, which had each its di&s;tinct pro&s;pect, and with one mu&s;ic room in the thicke&s;t part of the &s;hrubbery. Of the building nothing is now vi&s;ible but &s;ome disjointed &s;tones; and of the garden, only the broken trunks of trees. The palace was burned and the gardens levelled by the French, that they might not afford &s;helter to the Pru&s;&s;ians, during the &s;iege.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="193">
From this &s;pot we were &s;hewn the po&s;itions of the allied forces, the cour&s;e of their approaches and the chief outworks of the city. Hock|heim, Ko&s;theim and Ca&s;&s;el lay before us, on the other &s;ide of the river; a gentle ri&s;e, on this &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of nearly a mile, was the fir&s;t &s;tation of the allies, part of who&s;e force was covered behind it; their la&s;t batteries were within two hundred and fifty paces of the city. The ground had been &s;ince levelled, and was now covered with &s;tanding corn, but the track of the trenches was, in &s;ome places, vi&s;ible. On the other hand, the forts, in which the &s;trength of the whole &s;o much con&s;i&s;ts, were completely repaired, and had no appearance of having been &s;o lately attacked. They are five in num|ber, and, being rai&s;ed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the walls of the city, no near approaches can be made, till &s;ome of them are either taken, or de&s;troyed; for they are &s;aid to be regular and &s;trong forti|fications, capable of containing numerous garri&s;ons, and communi|cating with the city it&s;elf by pa&s;&s;ages, cut in the ground, through which they may be con&s;tantly reinforced.</P>
<P>Only one of the&s;e five forts, that neare&s;t to the river, was de&s;troyed in the late &s;iege, which would have been much more tedious, but for the want of provi&s;ions and medicines, that began to be felt in the garri&s;on. The walls of the city were almo&s;t uninjured, &s;o that it has not been thought nece&s;&s;ary to repair them in the few places, where balls may be perceived to have &s;truck. The bombardment was the chief annoyance of the garri&s;on, who were not &s;heltered in ca&s;erns, and who&s;e magazines, both of ammunition and provi&s;ion, were fre|quently
<PB N="186" REF="194">
de&s;troyed by it. Their numbers were al&s;o greatly reduced by &s;allies and by engagements, on the other &s;ide of the Rhine, in defence of Ca&s;&s;el, or in attack of part of an i&s;land, called the Bleiau.</P>
<P>We walked round the city upon what is termed the <HI>glacis,</HI> that is upon the &s;lope, which a&s;cends from the plain towards the top of the ditch, and which is the furthe&s;t of the defen&s;ive works, being very gradually rai&s;ed, that tho&s;e, who are upon it, may be expo&s;ed, at every &s;tep, to the fire from the walls. The forts, which are formed of &s;olid earthen works, covered with turf, would &s;carcely attract the notice of an unmilitary eye, if the channelled pa&s;&s;ages to them did not i&s;&s;ue from this &s;lope, and if the &s;entinels, &s;talking upon the parapets, did not &s;eem of a gigantic &s;ize, by having their whole figures rai&s;ed again&s;t the light.</P>
<P>Mentz was at this time the dep&ocirc;t of &s;tores for the Pru&s;&s;ian army on the Rhine, and there were per&s;ons employed upon the <HI>glacis,</HI> in counting heaps of cannon balls, which had been delivered from &s;ome neighbouring foundery. On the bank of the river, others were throwing waggon-loads of hay into large barges, on which it was piled to &s;uch an height, that &s;mall pa&s;&s;ages were cut through it for the rowers to work in. There were nine or ten barges &s;o filled; and in the&s;e labours more activity was apparent than in any other tran&s;actions we &s;aw at Mentz.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed round the city, between the walls and the forts, which protect them, to the north, we&s;t and &s;outh, we came, at this latter &s;ide, to &s;ome other &s;ignals of a theatre of war. Here had been
<PB N="187" REF="195">
a noble alley of at lea&s;t a mile and a half long, formed of poplars as large and high as elms, and &s;urrounded, on each &s;ide, by plantations, inter&s;ected by &s;mall and irregular walks. Being led along the banks of the Rhine, this alley, with its adjoining groves, afforded a mo&s;t delightful promenade, and was cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the be&s;t ornaments, given to the river, in its whole cour&s;e. This al&s;o was de&s;troyed upon the approach of the be&s;iegers, that it might not afford them &s;helter. The trunks of the &s;turdy trees, cut at the height of one or two feet from the ground, &s;hew, by their &s;olidity and the abundance of their vigorous &s;hoots, how long they might have flouri&s;hed, but for this di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;hman, walking amid&s;t the en&s;igns of &s;uch artificial and premature de&s;olation, cannot help con&s;idering the natural &s;ecurity of his country, and rejoicing, that, even if the &s;trong and plain policy of neglecting all foreign con&s;equence, and avoiding all foreign intere&s;ts, except the commercial ones, which may be maintained by a navy, &s;hould for ever be rejected, &s;till his home cannot be invaded; and, though the expence of wars &s;hould make poverty general, the imme|diate horrors of them cannot enter the cities, or the cottages of an i&s;land.</P>
<P>Great part of our time at Mentz was occupied by enquiries con|cerning the &s;iege, which was not &s;o much a topic as we had expected to find it. We probably heard, however, all that was to be told, and had a German pamphlet recommended, containing the hi&s;tory of the place from the fir&s;t inva&s;ion of the French to their departure.

The authenticity of this was a&s;&s;ured to us; and it is partly from it, partly from the accounts given by our friends, that the following &s;hort narrative has been extracted.</P>

<HEAD>OF MENTZ IN 1792 AND 1793.</HEAD>
<P>THE entrance of a French army into Worms, in the beginning of October 1792, had excited a con&s;iderable alarm in Mentz, before the inhabitants of the latter city received the accounts, which were not long wanting, of expre&s;s and avowed preparations for a march towards them. Great numbers of French emigrants had been drawn to the city by the meeting of the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia there, a few months before; many had arrived &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of their army in Champagne; and, during the approach of the Republican troops to Spires and Worms, families were continually pa&s;&s;ing through the city, joining tho&s;e, who began to take their flight from it. The narrow &s;treets were filled with carriages, and the di&s;tre&s;sful ha&s;te of the travellers &s;erved to depre&s;s the &s;pirits of the inhabitants, who &s;aw how little their city was thought capable of defence. On the 15th of October, Baron d'Albini, a coun&s;ellor of the Court, called the Burge&s;&s;es together, and admoni&s;hed them to make preparations for their &s;ecurity; he al&s;o enquired, whether they thought it prudent, that the Elector &s;hould remain in the city with them? and, it being readily an&s;wered, that they did not, the Elector
<PB N="189" REF="197">
&s;et out for Wurtzburg, a town about 100 miles di&s;tant, and was fol|lowed by the members of the government. At the &s;ame time, a con|&s;iderable emigration of the other inhabitants took place.</P>
<P>The approach of the French had been &s;o little fore&s;een, till within the few la&s;t weeks, that the garri&s;on did not amount to a tenth part of the war complement. The inhabitants, however, having happily had little experience of &s;ieges, did not know what this complement &s;hould be, and, after the fir&s;t alarm, began to think the deficiency might be ea&s;ily remedied. The Electoral troops, having &s;ent &s;ome u&s;ele&s;s detachments to Spires, amounted to only 968 men, to whom an hundred were added, obtained from Na&s;&s;au, Oranien, Weilburg, Bieberich and Fuld by the Elector's demands of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his neighbours. Two hundred and &s;even Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars of E&s;terhazy had al&s;o arrived, on the 13th, and all the inhabitants of the Rhein|gau, a populous di&s;trict, bordering upon the Rhine, were &s;ummoned to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the capital. The antient &s;ociety of Archers of the city laid down their bows for mu&s;quets; the Academicians formed them&s;elves into a corps, and were placed, together with the Archers, at &s;everal outpo&s;ts. The traders, though exempt from per|&s;onal &s;ervice, and unwilling to &s;urrender that privilege, re&s;olved to pay double watch-money for &s;ub&s;titutes. It began to be thought, that the threatened progre&s;s of the French had been untruly report|ed; that the &s;iege could not be commenced at that late &s;ea&s;on of the year; and la&s;tly, that &s;ome promi&s;ed reinforcements of Au&s;trian troops could not be far off.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="198">
But, on the 19th of October, the French, in four columns, began to &s;urround the place. They wore, at fir&s;t, white cockades, expect|ing to be mi&s;taken for the army of M. de Cond&eacute;; they were, how|ever, known, and fired upon. Though &s;ome days had been pa&s;&s;ed in preparation, it was now found, that there was little readine&s;s for de|fence. The be&s;t artillerymen had been lo&s;t at Spires; there were, at fir&s;t, no hor&s;es to draw the cannon, &s;o that oxen were u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; the neare&s;t balls to the batteries of twenty-four pound can|non were ca&s;t for twelve-pounders; and many of the mu&s;quet car|tridges could not be fired. In a few hours, however, &s;everal of the arti&s;ans applied them&s;elves to the making of cartridges; hor&s;es were &s;upplied by the &s;ervants of the Court and the Nobility, and all hands were, in &s;ome way or other, employed. It was then reported, that a corps of Au&s;trian troops was in the neighbourhood, and, on the 19th, 1800 men entered the city. The&s;e were recruits without ammuni|tion, and, for the mo&s;t part, without arms, being on their march to join the army of the Emperor. They were then under the command of two, or three &s;ubalterns; but &s;ome other Imperial officers came in from the neighbourhood, and arms were obtained from the Elector's ar&s;enal. After this reinforcement there were probably about four thou&s;and men in arms in the city.</P>
<P>With this force, it is allowed, that a much longer defence than was made might have been expected; and, unle&s;s there was &s;ome failure of the commander's attention, the treachery of an engineer, to whom the &s;urrender is imputed, could certainly not have been &s;o effectual.
<PB N="191" REF="199">
EIKENMAYER, this engineer, had, it &s;eems, made known to the French the commander's preparations for defence; intelligence, which, if the preparations had been greater, could have been but little &s;erviceable to the a&s;&s;ailants. His chief a&s;&s;i&s;tance was afforded to them by much more con&s;picuous means; for, as the inhabitants went frequently to a building called St. Stephen's Tower, to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the be|&s;iegers, he a&s;&s;ured them, that the army, which really amounted only to eleven thou&s;and men, con&s;i&s;ted of forty thou&s;and; that they had with them two-and-twenty waggons, laden with &s;caling ladders, and that the city would pre&s;ently be taken by &s;torm. The &s;ame repre&s;enta|tions of the be&s;iegers' force were al&s;o made by him to the Council of War; and the&s;e, it is &s;aid, determined them to the &s;urrender, before the French had rai&s;ed a battery again&s;t the works.</P>
<P>Many of the citizens, however, were &s;urpri&s;ed and enraged at this re&s;olution; and the captain of the Au&s;trian reinforcements expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure, at the Council Hou&s;e, where he declared, that he would continue to defend the place, even without permi&s;&s;ion. In the mean time, the capitulation was &s;igned, and he was induced to &s;ubmit to it by the &s;olicitations even of the citizens, by whom it was blamed, and by their repre&s;entations, that, in the pre&s;ent agitated temper of the inhabitants, all attempts at defence mu&s;t be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Baron d'ALBINI carried news of the &s;urrender to the Elector, at Wurtzburg, and, about five o'clock, on the 21&s;t of October, two French officers came to the Council Hou&s;e, followed by two companies of grenadiers. On the 22d, eight thou&s;and French entered the city, the
<PB N="192" REF="200">
other three thou&s;and having marched, the preceding day, to Franck|fort; the inhabitants, a&s;toni&s;hed to find them&s;elves taken by &s;o &s;mall a force, now &s;aw, to their &s;till greater &s;urpri&s;e, that their conquerors had &s;carcely any heavy cannon. This day was pa&s;&s;ed in a&s;&s;igning quarters to the troops, and, on the next, Cu&s;tine, the commander of the French, called the members of the City Council together, to whom, in a &s;hort &s;peech, he promi&s;ed the protection of per&s;ons and properties, inviting them, at the &s;ame time, to promote the fraterni|zation of the inhabitants with the French nation. Profe&s;&s;or BOH|MER, who had accepted the office of his Secretary, tran&s;lated this addre&s;s into German, and it was circulated through the city.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the French had no &s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;udden prize, than they began to fore&s;ee the probability of being reduced to defen&s;ive mea&s;ures and to prepare for them. They imme|diately collected contributions of forage and corn from the neigh|bouring villages; the &s;treets were rendered almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able by the loads brought in; and, as the magazines were &s;oon filled, great quan|tities were wa&s;ted by being expo&s;ed to the rain in gardens, and trod|den under the feet of hor&s;es in the &s;treets. The garri&s;on was &s;oon increa&s;ed to 20,000 men, of whom &s;ometimes three hundred &s;ome|times five hundred were lodged in each convent. The French &s;oldiery having committed &s;ome exce&s;&s;es, Cu&s;tine reproved their licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, and began to habituate them to di&s;cipline by ordering a retire|ment to their quarters, at certain hours, by beat of drum.</P>
<P>The inhabitants &s;oon began to &s;u&s;pect the contrivance and the per|&s;ons,
<PB N="193" REF="201">
that had produced the &s;urrender; for Eikenmayer lived in inti|macy with Cu&s;tine; Profe&s;&s;or Metternich, of the Academy of Mentz, mounted the French cockade; and the Elector's phy&s;ician, having left the city, upon a promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting &s;ome pea&s;ants, whom he a&s;&s;erted to be &s;eized with an infectious fever, had carried on a corre|&s;pondence with the French, as had PATOKI, a merchant, born at Col|mar, who had lately received the right of citizen&s;hip.</P>
<P>The palaces of the Elector and the Provo&s;t were now ran&s;acked; and, though it had been publi&s;hed as a rule, that the property of pri|vate individuals &s;hould not be touched, the hou&s;es of the nobility were treated, as if they had belonged to the Prince. The profligacy and pride of Cu&s;tine became every day more con&s;picuous, and were oppre&s;&s;ive upon the garri&s;on, as well as the inhabitants, though in a le&s;s degree. Johanne&s;berg, a village upon the Rhine, at the di&s;tance of a few miles, is celebrated for its wines, which fell for three times the price of tho&s;e of Hockheim. Cu&s;tine &s;ent a part of the garri&s;on &s;olely to bring him the wines from the cellars of the Prince of Fuld, who has a palace there; but, a compromi&s;e being propo&s;ed, the negotiation was protracted &s;o long, that a Pru&s;&s;ian corps, for which the Prince had &s;ent, carried Johanne&s;berg, before the terms were con|cluded. The Prince &s;aved his money, and lo&s;t only eighteen barrels of wine, of which part was &s;ent to Paris, and the re&s;t &s;upplied the entertainments given by Cu&s;tine.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the Germans, who attached them&s;elves to Cu&s;tine, &s;up|plied him with information of the &s;tate of the whole country. His
<PB N="194" REF="202">
Secretary, Profe&s;&s;or Bohmer, had begun the in&s;titution of a Club &s;o early as the 22d of October; but this &s;ociety is thought to have become inconvenient, and they &s;oon after began to prepare for a National Convention in Mentz.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Ca&s;&s;el was &s;urveyed, and the fortifications, for which Eikenmayer is &s;aid to have furni&s;hed the de&s;ign, were com|menced. The neighbouring pea&s;ants were &s;ummoned to work at the&s;e, at the price of fifteen French &s;ous, or about &s;even pence halfpenny a day; and intrenchments were thrown round Ko&s;theim.</P>
<P>On the 17th of December, Cu&s;tine publi&s;hed a proclamation, in which he &s;tated, that, whereas &s;ome per&s;ons had &s;uppo&s;ed the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to have &s;o little re&s;pect for his character as to have invited him to a &s;urrender, none &s;hould pre&s;ume, on pain of death, to &s;peak of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, in future. This proclamation gave the inhabitants of Mentz information, that the Pru&s;&s;ians were approaching. Some German troops had, indeed, begun by degrees to occupy the ground about Coblentz, but in a condition, which did not promi&s;e active mea&s;ures, being weakened by a long march and by &s;ickne&s;s; the He&s;&s;ians po&s;ted them&s;elves between Hanau and Franckfort; and the Pru&s;&s;ians advanced &s;o near to the latter city, that the &s;cattered parties of the French retired to, and at length lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>About this time, an Electoral Profe&s;&s;or of Philo&s;ophy and a Canon of Mentz, named Dor&s;el, who had left his po&s;ts, in the preceding year, to be naturalized, at Stra&s;bourg, returned with a de&s;ign for an union of Spires, Worms and Mentz into one territory, under the protection
<PB N="195" REF="203">
of the French. He procured the &s;ub&s;titution of a Municipality for the City Council. He obtained con&s;iderable influence in the city; and, on the 1&s;t of January 1793, when the three commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, Reubell, Merlin and Hau&s;&s;man entered Mentz, and were received by Cu&s;tine with military honours, they &s;hewed more attention to the Profe&s;&s;or than to the General.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian head quarters had been e&s;tabli&s;hed within a &s;hort di&s;|tance of Mentz; but, during all December, there had been only affairs of advanced po&s;ts, &s;o that &s;ome tranquillity prevailed in the city. On the 6th of January, Hockheim was a&s;&s;ailed by &s;ix thou&s;and Pru&s;|&s;ians; the French, however, had been informed of the preparations for attack, and had time to retire to Ko&s;theim and Ca&s;&s;el, leaving 112 pri&s;oners and twelve pieces of cannon. Some French, who had con|cealed them&s;elves in the church tower, were thrown headlong from it, for having &s;houted, or thrown &s;tones at the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, as he pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After this, another month pa&s;&s;ed, without ho&s;tile attempts on either &s;ide. The Pru&s;&s;ian troops were refre&s;hed by re&s;t; the French pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame time, partly in balls, to which all the ladies of Mentz were invited, and partly in preparations for defence. On the 17th of January, a &s;mall tree of liberty, which had been planted in Novem|ber, was removed, and a fir, &s;eventy feet high, placed in its &s;tead, with much ceremony. All the inhabitants were pre&s;&s;ingly invited, upon this occa&s;ion; Me&s;&s;rs. Reubell, Merlin, Hau&s;&s;man and Cu&s;tine attended; the Mayor, Municipality, and the Members of the Clubs followed;
<PB N="196" REF="204">
the en&s;igns of the former government were burned; Cu&s;tine called upon the mu&s;ic of the garri&s;on for French airs, which occupied the re&s;t of the day; and the evening concluded with entertainments and dancing. Soon after, the Commi&s;&s;ioners left the city, and proceeded on a journey to the Mo&s;elle.</P>
<P>On the 16th of February, Cu&s;tine publi&s;hed a proclamation, and two new Commi&s;&s;ioners, who had ju&s;t arrived, i&s;&s;ued ano|ther, founded upon a decree of the French Convention, relative to the union of other countries with France. The Council Hou&s;e was full from morning till night; the a&s;&s;embled traders declared their adherence to the Germanic &s;y&s;tem; and the new Commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;eemed inclined to li&s;ten to their remon&s;trances. But, when the three former Commi&s;&s;ioners returned, they treated the Deputies of the trades with great haughtine&s;s, and refu&s;ed them permi&s;&s;ion to &s;end agents to Paris. A &s;econd deputation, on the 22d of Febru|ary, was no better received, and they were informed, that the 24th was the day for the commencement of the new form. The traders are de&s;cribed to have been much affected, at the return of their Depu|ties. On the 23d of February, early in the morning, the author of a remon&s;trance, which had been pre&s;ented, was arre&s;ted and carried into bani&s;hment, being accompanied by guards to the advanced po&s;ts of the Pru&s;&s;ians, at Hockheim.</P>
<P>The inhabitants now began to leave the city by pa&s;&s;ports, which were, however, not ea&s;ily procured, or u&s;ed. A proclamation by the Municipality divided Mentz into &s;ections, and directed the manner,
<PB N="197" REF="205">
in which each &s;ection &s;hould elect a repre&s;entative, on the 24th. On that day, the &s;treets were unu&s;ually &s;ilent, all the former bur|ge&s;&s;es having re&s;olved to remain in their hou&s;es, except one, and only 266 per&s;ons met to take the new oath and to make the new elections. On the 25th, another proclamation came out, and &s;everal bani&s;h|ments &s;ucceeded; but the burge&s;&s;es &s;till adhered to their re&s;olution. The Municipality, on the 1&s;t of March, again invited them to take the new oaths, and gave notice of an order of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to the Mayor, to publi&s;h a li&s;t of the &s;worn and un&s;worn, on the Mon|day or Tue&s;day following. Notwith&s;tanding this, the number of &s;worn did not equal 350.</P>
<P>Some of the neighbouring villages, which were vi&s;ited by the French Commi&s;&s;ioners, accepted their terms; the greater part refu&s;ed them.</P>
<P>At Worms, where clubs, &s;imilar to tho&s;e at Mentz, had been formed, 1051 per&s;ons took the oaths. The inhabitants of Bingen refu&s;ed them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;ome expeditions were made into the Palatinate, and corn, to the amount of &s;ixty thou&s;and florins, was taken away, before the reiterated remon&s;trances of the Palatine Re&s;ident at Mentz, upon the &s;ubject of his ma&s;ter's neutrality, could re&s;train them. In the fir&s;t days of February, the French had al&s;o entered Deux Ponts, where the Duke relied &s;o much upon his having &s;upplied only his contingent to the trea&s;ure of the Empire, that he had not left his palace, though he knew of their approaches to his country. On the

9th, at eleven at night, the Duke and Duche&s;s fled, with the utmo&s;t pre|cipitation, to Manheim, having left the palace only one hour before the French entered it. Great quantities of forage were &s;wept away from this country, and brought to Mentz, which the allies now ap|proached &s;o nearly, that the garri&s;on ha&s;tily completed the fortifica|tions of Ca&s;&s;el, and filled the magazines with &s;tores, left the commu|nication &s;hould be cut off by the de&s;truction of the bridge.</P>
<P>On the 15th of February, they had begun to de&s;troy the palace of <HI>La Favorita,</HI> and to erect a battery upon its ruins. Though the car|riage of provi&s;ions now occupied &s;o much of their attention, a great number of large and &s;mall cannon were brought from Landau; fre&s;h troops arrived, and General Wimpfen, who had defended Thion|ville again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, was declared the fir&s;t in command. By bani&s;hments and emigration, the number of per&s;ons in the city was reduced fifteen thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The new National A&s;&s;embly met in Mentz, on the 10th of March, that city having cho&s;en &s;ix deputies, Spires two, Worms two, and &s;ome other places one each. On the 17th, they had their fir&s;t &s;it|ting, and, on the 18th, declared all the country between Landau and Bingen, which places were then the limits of the French po&s;ts near the Rhine, united in one independent &s;tate. On the 19th, was agi|tated the great que&s;tion relative to the connections of this &s;tate, and it was not till the 21&s;t, that they declared their incorporation with the French. Three deputies, FORSTER, PATOKI and LUCKS were appointed, the next day, to carry this re&s;olution to Paris; and &s;everal
<PB N="199" REF="207">
decrees, relative to the interior admini&s;tration of this &s;tate, were pa&s;&s;ed, in con&s;equence of which many per&s;ons were conducted over the bridge into bani&s;hment, on the 30th.</P>
<P>Accounts now arrived, that the &s;iege would &s;hortly commence, and orders were i&s;&s;ued, relative to the prevention of fires, to the collection of &s;tores of provi&s;ions by each family, and to &s;everal other dome&s;tic particulars. All the inhabitants, tho&s;e e&s;pecially in the neighbourhood of the granaries, were directed to pre&s;erve large quantities of water; and the proprietors of gardens within the city were ordered to plant them with herbs. Officers were &s;ent round to examine the&s;e gardens. Already each family had been admoni&s;hed to provide &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for &s;even months; and the richer cla&s;s were now directed to furni&s;h a loan to the burge&s;&s;es, that the latter might be enabled to provide for the poor. In con&s;equence of this order, 38,646 florins 10 creitzers, or about 3200 l. were collected, and expended for provi&s;ions. The gardens and walks round the city were now di&s;mantled of their trees, of which tho&s;e in the <HI>Rheinallee,</HI> before mentioned, were an hundred years old. All the &s;ummer-hou&s;es and villas, within cannon-&s;hot of the city, were de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>On the 8th of March, the French garri&s;on in the fortre&s;s of Ko|nig&s;tein, which the Pru&s;&s;ians had blockaded for &s;ome months, &s;urren|dered. In this month al&s;o other advances were made towards Mentz. The Pru&s;&s;ian General Schonfield brought 12,000 men into the neigh|bourhood of Hockheim, near which the Saxons were po&s;ted; the
<PB N="200" REF="208">
King of Pru&s;&s;ia, his &s;on and the Duke of Brun&s;wick, who had pa&s;&s;ed part of the winter at Franckfort, left it, on the 23d of March; a bridge was laid, at St. Goar, over which numerous bodies of Pru&s;&s;ian troops pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine; the French fell back towards Bingen, and the Pru&s;&s;ians occupied a hill, not far from it. On the 28th, they were clo&s;er pre&s;&s;ed, and left all the villages in the neighbourhood of Bingen, from which place they were driven, the next day, by a bombardment.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, a &s;imilar retreat towards Mentz al&s;o took place from the &s;outhward. At Worms, during the abandonment, great quan|tities of hay and &s;traw were burned, and the burge&s;&s;es kept watch, all night, dreading the conflagration of the whole city by the flames, ri&s;ing from the magazines. Immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of hay and &s;traw were al&s;o burned at Frankenthal, where there had been a garri&s;on, during the whole winter; but the corn was carried away. At Spires, early on the 31&s;t of March, the burge&s;&s;es and troops were employed in throwing the hay and &s;traw from the magazines into the ditch; but it appeared that even this mode would not be expeditious enough, and fire was at length &s;et to the whole &s;tore at once.</P>
<P>In the retreat from Oppenheim, though the French were under con&s;iderable difficulties, they were upon the point of obtaining what they would have thought an abundant reward for them. It was on the 30th of March, that their cavalry and flying artillery took the road by Al&s;heim. As this was a place capable of making &s;ome de|fence,
<PB N="201" REF="209">
and there were Pru&s;&s;ian troops vi&s;ible at the gates, they began the attack by planting cannon, and directing a vigorous fire upon it. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who was at dinner in the town, and had not an hundred men with him, received his fir&s;t intelligence of their ap|proach from this fire. He immediately rode out, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and, &s;ending &s;ome hu&s;&s;ars to the &s;pot, the French did not con|tinue the conte&s;t, but made their retreat by another road. If they had known how few troops were in the town, they would, of cour&s;e, have entered it without commencing this fire; and the Pru&s;&s;ian offi|cers agree, that, if they had done &s;o, there would have been little chance of &s;aving their monarch. Had they been aware al&s;o, that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was there, they might have reduced this &s;light chance to an impo&s;&s;ibility; for they were &s;ufficiently numerous to have &s;urrounded the town, and had approached &s;o quietly, that they were not known to be near it. The Pru&s;&s;ians had no cannon, and the French were otherwi&s;e greatly &s;uperior; though, having no other purpo&s;e for entering the town, than to continue their retreat, they did not wait to conte&s;t it, but retired by another road. That a cir|cum&s;tance, which would have had &s;uch an effect upon the affairs of Europe, &s;hould have depended upon &s;o &s;light a chance as this, we could not have believed, if the &s;tory had not been confirmed to us by ample authority.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on of Mentz was increa&s;ed by the&s;e retreats to 23,000 men; General Kalkreuth, who commanded the blockade from Lau|benheim
<PB N="202" REF="210">
to Budenheim, a di&s;tance of twelve miles, had only 16,000 men. General Schonfield, with his corps of ob&s;ervation, was at Hockheim. The be&s;iegers, however, pre&s;ently amounted to 30,000 men. It is remarkable, that, though the French retreated from &s;eve|ral quarters, at once, and in many &s;mall columns, not one of the&s;e was effectually interrupted by the Pru&s;&s;ian commander.</P>
<P>Upon intelligence of the&s;e advances, the Elector of Mentz paid a vi&s;it to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, at his head quarters, and left his mini&s;ter, the Baron d'ALBINI, to attend to the affairs of the re|covered places.</P>
<P>In the beginning of April, the blockade was more clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, and the preparations for the &s;iege &s;eriou&s;ly commenced. General d'OYRE was made commander in the city, with a Council of &s;ixteen per&s;ons, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in re&s;toring the means of its defence. A per&s;on was placed at the top of an high building, called Stephen's Tower, with gla&s;&s;es, which enabled him to overlook the country for nine miles round. He had a &s;ecretary with him, that his view might never be unnece&s;&s;arily diverted, and was obliged to make a daily report of his ob&s;ervations. The beating of drums and ringing of bells were forbidden throughout the whole city, that the be&s;iegers might not know in what quarters the corps de garde were placed, or what churches were left without the military. All pro&s;pect hou&s;es and trees within the walls, which could &s;erve as marks to the fire without, were ordered to be demoli&s;hed. Many days were pa&s;&s;ed in

bringing further &s;tores of provi&s;ions into the city; after which an account of the &s;tock was taken, and there were found to be

<ITEM>2,503 of barley.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Council e&s;timated, that the garri&s;on had corn enough for nine months, rice for &s;even, and herbs for &s;ix. There were fifteen hundred hor&s;es, and it was reckoned, that the &s;traw was enough for ten months, the oats for four-and-twenty days, and the barley for eighty days. The garri&s;on was numbered, and found to con|&s;i&s;t of 22,653 per&s;ons; of whom to each &s;oldier was allotted, for the future, 24 ounces of bread, per day, in lieu of 28, and 4 ounces
<PB N="204" REF="212">
of fre&s;h meat, or 3 ounces of &s;alt, in lieu of 8 ounces of fre&s;h. The allowance of the &s;ick in the ho&s;pitals was changed from twelve to eight ounces.</P>
<P>During the&s;e preparations for a long &s;iege, the diminution of the number of inhabitants, by means of the clubs, was pur&s;ued. On the 8th of April, all per&s;ons, not u&s;eful to the army, were ordered to leave the city, unle&s;s they would take the new oath; at the &s;ame time, it was &s;aid, that, on account of the fore&s;een want of money, the &s;oldiers, employed on the works, would be no longer paid, but the other workmen would continue to receive their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on made their fir&s;t &s;ortie, on the night of the 10th and 11th, proceeding towards the Rhine. Ko&s;theim was imme|diately taken, and the attack upon the He&s;&s;ians &s;ucceeded, at fir&s;t, but a reinforcement compelled the French to retire. About this time, the Commi&s;&s;ioner Reubell went to Oppenheim, where he de|livered a propo&s;al for peace to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The village of Wei&s;&s;enau was contended for, on the 15th, 16th and 17th, and finally de&s;troyed, the French &s;oldiers, who remained upon the &s;pot, &s;ub&s;cribing 460 livres for the inhabitants.</P>
<P>On the 18th, nearly the whole of a French convoy of 90 waggons was taken by the Pru&s;&s;ians. On the 20th the Imperiali&s;ts erected a &s;mall fort on a point of land, near the Main, and the French, on the other hand, perfected a battery, at Ko&s;theim, with which they &s;et on fire &s;ome &s;tables.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="213">
The price of provi&s;ions was already &s;o much increa&s;ed in the city, that &s;alt butter co&s;t 48 creitzers, or 16d. pence per pound.</P>
<P>In the night of the 28th and 29th, the French landed in three ve&s;&s;els, and de&s;troyed a battery, erected near the Main. On the 1&s;t of May, at one in the morning, they attacked the Pru&s;&s;ians, at Hockheim, and &s;et the village of Ko&s;theim on fire. The Pru&s;&s;ians repul&s;ed them with lo&s;s, but they remained in Ko&s;theim, notwith|&s;tanding the fire, which continued for three days; they were then expelled by the Pru&s;&s;ians, but &s;oon returned with reinforcements, and a &s;anguinary conte&s;t commenced, at the end of which they con|tinued to be ma&s;ters of the village. A numerous garri&s;on was placed in it, which, on the 8th, was again attacked by the Pru&s;&s;ians, but without effect. Thus the greate&s;t part of May was &s;pent in conte&s;ts for villages and po&s;ts, in which the French were generally the a&s;&s;ailants. In the night of the 30th, they beat up, in three columns, the Pru&s;&s;ian head quarters, at Marienborn. Having marched barefooted and with &s;uch exact information, that they pa&s;&s;ed all the batteries unperceived, they entered the village it&s;elf, without re&s;i&s;tance, and, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, would have &s;urpri&s;ed the com|mander, if they had not fired at his windows, beat their drums, and begun to &s;hout <HI>Vive la nation!</HI> Three balls, which entered the apartment of General KALKREUTH, admoni&s;hed him to quit it, and a &s;entinel &s;tepped up ju&s;t in time to &s;hoot a French &s;oldier, who had &s;eized him. Prince Louis Ferdinand of Pru&s;&s;ia immediately arrived with &s;ome troops, and the French began to retire, leaving
<PB N="206" REF="214">
thirty pri&s;oners and twenty killed of 6000, engaged in the enter|pri&s;e. The lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians was con&s;iderable; among&s;t the re&s;t Captain Vo&s;s, a relative of Mademoi&s;elle Vo&s;s, well known in the Court of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>On the 4th of June, the allowance to the garri&s;on was ordered to be two pounds of bread and one bottle of wine for each &s;oldier, per day.</P>
<P>In the night of the 6th and 7th, the cannonade was very fierce, on both &s;ides; in Mentz a powder magazine was fired by a bomb, and blew up with a dreadful explo&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;carcene&s;s of provi&s;ions increa&s;ed, &s;o that a pound of fre&s;h butter co&s;t &s;ix &s;hillings. Hor&s;efle&s;h began to be con&s;umed in many families.</P>
<P>On the night of the 9th and 10th of June, the garri&s;on made four &s;orties, which ended in con&s;iderable lo&s;s, on both &s;ides, and in the retirement of the French into the city. On the 10th, they attacked, at eight in the morning, a po&s;t near Gon&s;enheim, retreating with|out lo&s;s, after killing an officer and &s;everal men. This was their fir&s;t &s;ally in open day-light.</P>
<P>General Meu&s;nier, who had been wounded near Ca&s;&s;el, on the 7th, died on the 13th, and was buried the next day, within the new fortifications, all the officers of the garri&s;on, with the members of the convention and clubs, attending.</P>
<P>Some fire &s;hips were now completed, which a Dutch engineer had conducted from Holland, to be employed by the be&s;iegers in burn|ing
<PB N="207" REF="215">
the bridge of boats over the Rhine. It was thought, however, that their explo&s;ion would damage the city unnece&s;&s;arily, and they were rejected. In the night of the 15th, one of the&s;e floated down the river, whether by accident, or by the connivance of the inven|tor, is not known; the inhabitants were in the utmo&s;t terror, but it &s;truck again&s;t the quay, and, being immediately boarded, did no damage.</P>
<P>The trenches were opened, in the night of the 16th and 17th, but, the workmen having been ill conducted, were not covered in, at day-light, and were compelled to retire, leaving their implements be|hind them. Two nights afterwards, the work was renewed in good order and without lo&s;s, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, his &s;ons and the Duke of Brun&s;wick &s;urveying them from a neighbouring height. The fir&s;t balls fell in a &s;treet near one of the gates, and all that part of the town was pre&s;ently de&s;erted.</P>
<P>The 24th was a di&s;tre&s;sful day for the inhabitants. Four days before, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had &s;ent a general pa&s;&s;port for &s;uch as cho&s;e to come out, and 1500 per&s;ons, chiefly women and children, had accepted his offer. A &s;hort time after the gate had been opened, di&s;may was &s;pread through the whole city by an account, that the Pru&s;&s;ians would &s;uffer no more to pa&s;s and the French none to return. The bridge was covered with the&s;e unhappy fugitives, who had no food, or &s;helter, and who thought them&s;elves within reach of the Hock|heim batteries, that played furiou&s;ly upon the city. Two children lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es through fright. At length, the French &s;oldiers took
<PB N="208" REF="216">
compa&s;&s;ion upon them; they carried &s;everal per&s;ons into the city under their cloaks, and, the next day, their remon&s;trances again&s;t the inhumanity of the German clubbi&s;ts, who had &s;hut the gates again&s;t this defencele&s;s crowd, obliged them to permit the return of the whole number.</P>
<P>For &s;everal &s;ucceeding nights, the garri&s;on made &s;orties, with various effect, interrupting, but not preventing the completion of the parallel.</P>
<P>At &s;un&s;et, on the 27th, the be&s;iegers began a dreadful cannonade and bombardment. On this night, the &s;teeple of the church of Notre Dame caught fire; and during the alarm, excited by an im|men&s;e volume of flame, ari&s;ing in the mid&s;t of the city, the Au&s;|trians completely carried the French po&s;ts, near Wei&s;&s;enau. The next night was equally terrible to the inhabitants; the flames caught &s;everal parts of the city, among&s;t others the cathedral; &s;ome of the maga|zines took fire, and eleven hundred &s;acks of corn were burned. The church, formerly belonging to the Je&s;uits, was much injured. The French, intending to retaliate their la&s;t &s;urpri&s;e upon the Au&s;|trians, made a fruitle&s;s attack upon the Wei&s;&s;enau redoubt.</P>
<P>On the 29th of June, at mid-day, the French were driven from a point of land, near the Main, called the Bleiau. In this affair, a ve&s;&s;el, with 78 Pru&s;&s;ians on board, drove from her anchor, owing to the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the crew, and, during a fire, by which eight men were killed, made towards the city. The Pru&s;&s;ians were taken pri&s;oners, and exchanged the next day. At night, the bombard|ment
<PB N="209" REF="217">
was renewed; the <HI>Domprob&s;tei,</HI> or palace of the Provo&s;t, was burned and &s;everal of the neighbouring re&s;idences; in other parts of the city, &s;ome hou&s;es were reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>The next night, the church of the Franci&s;cans and &s;everal other public buildings were de&s;troyed. A dreadful fire, on the night of the 2d and 4th of June, con&s;umed the chapel of St. Alban. Families in the &s;outhern part of the city now con&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ed the night in their cellars; in the day-time, they ventured into their u&s;ual apart|ments; for the batteries of the be&s;iegers were by far the mo&s;t ter|rible, at night, when the whole city was a &s;ufficient mark for them, though their works could &s;carcely be di&s;cerned by the garri&s;on. In the day-time, the exactne&s;s of the French gunners frequently did great injury to the batteries, which, at night, were repaired and u&s;ed with equal effect again&s;t the city.</P>
<P>St. Alban's fort was now demoli&s;hed, &s;o that the be&s;ieged with|drew their cannon from it. Elizabeth fort was al&s;o much damaged. A &s;trong work, which the French had rai&s;ed, in prolongation of the <HI>glacis,</HI> divided the opinions of the Pru&s;&s;ian engineers. Some thought it &s;hould be pre&s;erved, when taken, becau&s;e it would command part of the town; others, that it &s;hould be demoli&s;hed. The latter opi|nion prevailed, and, in the night of the 5th and 6th, General MANSTEIN was ordered to make the attack with three battalions. He perfectly &s;ucceeded, as to the neare&s;t part of the work, but the other, on account of its &s;olid foundation, could not be entirely de|&s;troyed. In the mean time, two battalions were &s;ent, under cover

of the darkne&s;s, to attack the Zahlbach fort, a part of which they carried by &s;torm; but the reinforcements, immediately &s;upplied by the garri&s;on, obliged them to retire. Two Pru&s;&s;ian officers were killed; one wounded, and another, with one-and-thirty men, taken. The Pru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">83 men; the French had twelve killed and forty-&s;even wounded.</P>
<P>On the 6th of July, the French repaired the damaged fort, the di&s;tance of it from the Pru&s;&s;ians preventing the latter from hinder|ing them.</P>
<P>At night, General Klei&s;t carried the fort, at Zahlbach, by a &s;econd attack, and demoli&s;hed it; at the &s;ame time, &s;ome batteries of the &s;econd parallel were perfected. The French could not &s;upport the lo&s;s of this fort; on the 7th, they attacked the &s;cite; carried it, after a &s;evere conte&s;t; and rebuilt it. At night, they were driven back again and the fort entirely de&s;troyed. In the &s;ame night they were driven from Ko&s;theim, after a furious battle, by the Pru&s;&s;ian Gene|ral Schonfield. During this engagement, the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fla&s;hes and explo&s;ion of bombs &s;eemed to fill the air with flame. A Pru&s;&s;ian detachment having been po&s;ted on the road to Ca&s;&s;el, in or|der to prevent the garri&s;on of that place from &s;ending &s;uccour to Ko&s;t|heim, this road was &s;o &s;trongly bombarded by the French, that &s;even bombs were frequently &s;een in the air at once. The lo&s;s was great, on both &s;ides, in this engagement, after which the Council in the city re&s;olved, to make no more attempts upon Ko&s;theim, on account of the di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="219">
The following night, the fire was le&s;s than u&s;ual, but a few bombs and grenades fell in the city, where the inhabitants had now learned to extingui&s;h &s;uch as grounded, before their <HI>fu&s;ees</HI> were con&s;umed. They al&s;o formed them&s;elves into parties for the ready &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of fires. The next morning, the garri&s;on &s;aw the works of the be&s;iegers brought to within two hundred and fifty paces of the walls.</P>
<P>About this time, the &s;ickline&s;s of the garri&s;on became apparent, and General d'Oyr&eacute; informed the Council, that, on account of this and of the fatiguing &s;ervice of the works, he feared the defence could not be much longer continued. He lamented, that the troops of the line were &s;o few, and the others &s;o inexperienced.</P>
<P>For &s;everal nights, the works of the be&s;iegers were eagerly pu&s;h|ed, but &s;till they were not &s;o forward, as had been expected. Some of the be&s;ieging corps began to be &s;ickly; the King of Pru&s;&s;ia having re&s;olved to employ no more labourers, it was reckoned, that the &s;oldiers, for eight-and-forty hours of work, had only eighteen of re&s;t. On the other hand, they were a&s;&s;ured, that the garri&s;on mu&s;t be equally fatigued, &s;ince, in &s;uch an exten&s;ive fortification, none could be left long unemployed.</P>
<P>The French had been, for &s;ome time, bu&s;ied in forming what is called a Fleche at the head of one of their forts, and this was thought nece&s;&s;ary to be de&s;troyed. It was attacked in the night of the 12th and 13th by the Au&s;trians; but &s;o much time was pa&s;&s;ed in their operations, that the French fell upon them, in great force, about two in the morning, and beat them away, with lo&s;s. The Au&s;trians were as little employed as po&s;&s;ible in &s;ervices of this &s;ort.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="220">
On the 13th of July, another battery was &s;tormed by the Pru&s;&s;ians; but, as the officer, unlike the Au&s;trians, advanced with too little caution, his party was much hurt by &s;ome pieces of concealed can|non, and the enterpri&s;e failed.</P>
<P>The night of the 13th and 14th was pa&s;&s;ed in much agitation by the garri&s;on and inhabitants. Several of the public buildings were &s;et fire to and burned by grenades. The works of the be&s;iegers were now greatly advanced. The garri&s;on made five &s;orties in this night, and were repul&s;ed in all, lo&s;ing an hundred men, while the be&s;iegers lo&s;t eight killed and one-and-thirty wounded.</P>
<P>On the 14th of July, a ce&s;&s;ation of arms took place from &s;even o'clock in the morning till one. In the city, the French celebrated their annual f&ecirc;te; General d'OYRE and the troops took the oath, and MERLIN delivered an addre&s;s to them. In the Au&s;trian camp, the Prince de CONDE was received with a <HI>feu de joye.</HI> During this ce&s;|&s;ation, the &s;oldiers upon the different outpo&s;ts entered into conver&s;a|tion with each other, and the French boa&s;ted of the difficulties they laboured under from the length of the &s;iege.</P>
<P>At night, an affair at the Fleche co&s;t the allies, who &s;ucceeded in part, ninety men; the French confe&s;&s;ed, that this work co&s;t them in all three hundred. The inhabitants of the city were again greatly alarmed, their &s;treets being covered with a &s;hower of grenades. The laboratory and a part of the Benedictine abbey were burned, and two explo&s;ions took place at the former. The whole city &s;hook with each report, and, in the nearer parts, all the windows were broken and
<PB N="213" REF="221">
the doors bur&s;t open. The remainder of the hay and &s;traw was con&s;umed in this fire; the whole &s;tock of other forage was reduced to a &s;ufficiency for four days; and the &s;urgeon's &s;tores were much damaged.</P>
<P>Still the Fleche prevented the be&s;iegers from completing their &s;econd parallel. It was, therefore, again attacked, on the night of the 16th and 17th, Prince Louis Ferdinand of Pru&s;&s;ia commanding at the a&s;&s;ault, in which he was one of twelve officers wounded. The Fleche was then completely carried.</P>
<P>The next night was very indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pent by the be&s;iegers in forming new batteries, and tho&s;e of the &s;econd parallel were rai&s;ed, before there were cannon enough at hand to place upon them. The French took advantage of this, and brought a part of theirs to bear, &s;o as to enfilade the parallel, with great effect; the Pru&s;&s;ians almo&s;t immediately lo&s;ing an officer and forty men.</P>
<P>In the city, the &s;ick had now increa&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;ix hundred men were brought from Ca&s;&s;el, on the 17th, to reinforce the garri&s;on. On the 18th, the commandant informed the Council, that there was a want of fodder and &s;uch a lo&s;s of hor&s;es, by de&s;ertion, that there were not cavalry enough left for &s;ervice. The &s;oldiers, who knew the deficiency of medicines and other means of relief for the wounded, were unwilling to be led to &s;orties. Though corn had not failed, flour, it appeared, &s;oon would, for &s;ome of the mills had been ren|dered un&s;erviceable, for the pre&s;ent, by &s;hot, and others were de&s;ert|ed by the millers.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="222">
At night, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon the Fleche, it was re&s;olved, that the garri&s;on, which had hitherto &s;carcely &s;uffered a night to pa&s;s, without making &s;ome &s;orties, &s;hould, for the future, adhere &s;olely to defen&s;ive mea&s;ures. Some engineers propo&s;ed to abandon the whole line of forts, and others, that two of the large&s;t &s;hould be blown up. The General and Council, at length, confe&s;&s;ed, that they could not continue the defence, and a&s;&s;ured the inhabitants, who had declared them&s;elves in their favour, that a longer delay of the &s;urrender would produce a more &s;evere di&s;po&s;ition of the be|&s;iegers towards them, without increa&s;ing the chance of e&s;caping it.</P>
<P>A negotiation, relative to the &s;urrender, was now begun by D'OYRE, in a letter, which partly replied to one from the Pru&s;&s;ian commander KALKREUTH, upon the &s;ubject of the departure of aged per&s;ons and children from the city. Their corre&s;pondence continued till the 20th, and &s;everal letters were exchanged, chiefly upon the que&s;tion of the removal, or detention of the inhabitants, who had attached them&s;elves to the French; it was then broken off, upon a di&s;agreement, as to this and &s;ome other points. The firing, on both &s;ides, had in the mean time continued, and the be&s;iegers carried on the trenches, though the&s;e were now &s;uch an ea&s;y mark for the garri|&s;on, that they lo&s;t an officer and five-and-twenty men, in the night of the 19th and 20th. The next night, the Dominicans' church in the city took fire, and &s;ix French &s;oldiers were buried under its ruins.</P>
<P>Upon a renewal of the intercour&s;e, the fire &s;lackened, on the 21&s;t; but, on &s;ome delays in the negotiation, was threatened to be recom|menced.
<PB N="215" REF="223">
At length, the conditions of the &s;urrender were &s;ettled, and the negotiation &s;igned, on the 22d of July, by the two Generals Kalkreut hand D'Oyr&eacute;; the former having rendered the capitulation &s;omewhat ea&s;ier than was expected for the garri&s;on, becau&s;e the Duke of Brun&s;wick had only nineteen thou&s;and men to cover the &s;iege, and Cu&s;tine had forty thou&s;and, which were near enough to attack him. General KALKREUTH'S orders are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, upon any terms, that would give it him quickly.</P>
<P>At this time, the garri&s;on, which, at the commencement of the &s;iege, had con&s;i&s;ted of 22,653 men, was reduced to 17,038, having had 1959 killed, 3334 wounded, or rendered un&s;erviceable by &s;ick|ne&s;s, and having lo&s;t 322 by de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the be&s;iegers is &s;tated at about 3000 men.</P>
<P>The con&s;umption of ammunition, on the part of the French, was found to have been
<LIST>
<ITEM>681,850 pounds of powder,</ITEM>
<ITEM>106,152 cannon balls,</ITEM>
<ITEM>10,278 bombs,</ITEM>
<ITEM>6592 grenades,</ITEM>
<ITEM>44,500 pounds of iron,</ITEM>
<ITEM>300,340 mu&s;quet cartridges;</ITEM>
</LIST>
and, during the &s;iege, 107 cannon either bur&s;t, or were rendered un|&s;erviceable by the be&s;iegers' &s;hot. Towards the conclu&s;ion, &s;ixty can|non al&s;o became u&s;ele&s;s by the failure of balls of the proper calibre.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="224">
On the 24th and 25th, the garri&s;on marched out, MERLIN leading the fir&s;t column of 7500 men. The members of the Clubs, who would have gone out with the troops, were pointed out by the other inhabitants and detained; but the Elector had the magnanimity to think of no other retaliation, than their impri&s;onment in a tower, near the Rhine, where they have &s;ince remained.</P>
<P>There was now lei&s;ure to examine the city, and it was found, that &s;ix churches were in ruins; that &s;even man&s;ions of the nobility had been burned, and that very few hou&s;es had e&s;caped, without &s;ome damage. The &s;urrounding grounds were torn up by balls and bat|teries. The works of Ca&s;&s;el were &s;urrendered entire to the con|querors, and are an important addition to the &s;trength of Mentz, already reckoned one of the &s;tronge&s;t and large&s;t fortifications in Europe. Between Ca&s;&s;el and the ruins of Ko&s;theim not a tree was to be &s;een. All the neighbouring villages were more, or le&s;s, injured, being contended for, as po&s;ts, at the commencement of the &s;iege; and the country was &s;o much disfigured, that the proprietors of lands had &s;ome difficulty to a&s;certain their boundaries.</P>

<HEAD>MENTZ.</HEAD>
<P>SOMETHING has been already &s;aid of the pre&s;ent condi|tion of this city: upon a review it appears, that from the mention of churches, palaces, burge&s;&s;es, quays and &s;treets, we might be &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent it as a con&s;iderable place, either for &s;plendour, or com|merce, or for having its middle cla&s;&s;es numerou&s;ly filled. Any &s;uch opinion of Mentz will be very incorrect. After two broad and &s;ome|what hand&s;ome &s;treets, all the other pa&s;&s;ages in the city are narrow lanes, and into the&s;e many of the be&s;t hou&s;es open, having, for the mo&s;t part, their lower windows barricadoed, like tho&s;e of Cologne. The di&s;advantage, with which any buildings mu&s;t appear in &s;uch &s;ituations, is increa&s;ed by the neglected condition of the&s;e; for a German has no notion, that the out&s;ide of his hou&s;e &s;hould be clean, even if the in&s;ide is &s;o. An Engli&s;hman, who &s;pends a few hun|dred pounds in a year, has his hou&s;e in better condition, as to neat|ne&s;s, than any German nobleman's we &s;aw; a Dutchman, with fifty pounds a year, exceeds both.</P>
<P>The Elector's palace is a large turretted building of reddi&s;h &s;tone, with one front towards the Rhine, which it commands in a delightful point of view; but we did not hear, that it was &s;o much altered, by being now u&s;ed as a barrack, as that its appearance can formerly have been much le&s;s &s;uitable than at pre&s;ent to &s;uch a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="226">
On the quay there is &s;ome appearance of traffic, but not much in the city; &s;o that the transfer of commodities from ve&s;&s;els of other di&s;tricts to tho&s;e of the Electorate may be &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute great part of the &s;how near the river. The commerce is not &s;ufficient to encourage the building of warehou&s;es over the quay. The ve&s;&s;els are ill rigged, and the hulls are entirely covered with pitch, without paint. About thirty of the&s;e, apparently from forty to &s;eventy tons burthen, were lying near the quay; and the war could &s;carcely have dimini&s;hed their u&s;ual number, &s;o many being employed in carrying &s;tores for the armies.</P>
<P>The burge&s;&s;es are numerous, and have &s;ome privileges, which ren|der their political condition enviable to the other inhabitants of the Electorate. But, though the&s;e have invited manufacturers, and &s;ome|what encouraged commerce, there is not wealth enough in the neigh|bouring country, to make &s;uch a con&s;umption, as &s;hall render many traders pro&s;perous. In point of wealth, activity and addre&s;s, the bur|ge&s;&s;es of Mentz are much below the opinion, which mu&s;t be formed, while German cities are de&s;cribed and e&s;timated by their importance in their own country, rather than by a compari&s;on of their condition with that of others. A trader, it will be allowed, is at lea&s;t as likely to appear to advantage in his bu&s;ine&s;s as in any other &s;tate. His intelligence may &s;urely be, in &s;ome degree, judged of by tho&s;e, who deal with him; and that we might know &s;omething of tho&s;e of Mentz, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the little time we were left to our&s;elves in endeavouring to buy trifles at their &s;hops.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="227">
The idlene&s;s and inadvertence we generally &s;aw are difficult to be conceived; perhaps, the trouble, experienced in purcha&s;ing a book, may give an idea of them. We wanted the German pamphlet, from which mo&s;t of the above-mentioned particulars of the &s;iege are ex|tracted; and, as it related to a topic &s;o general within the place, we &s;miled, when our friends &s;aid they would <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> us to procure it, during a walk. Two book&s;ellers, to whom we applied, knew nothing of it; and one &s;uppo&s;ed, that an engraved view of the works would do quite as well. Pa&s;&s;ing another &s;hop, a young German gentleman enquired for it of the ma&s;ter, who was at the door, and heard, that we might have it, upon our return, in half an hour. The door, when we came back, was &s;hut, and no knocking could procure it to be opened; &s;o that we were obliged to &s;end into the dwelling-hou&s;e. When the &s;hopman came, he knew nothing of the book; but, being a&s;&s;ured that his ma&s;ter had promi&s;ed it, went away, and returned with a copy in &s;heets. We paid for this, and left it to be &s;ewed, which was agreed to be done, in three hours. At that time, it was not fini&s;hed, but might be had in another hour; and, after that hour, it was again promi&s;ed, within two. Finally, it could not be had, that night, but would be ready in the morning, and, in the morning, it was &s;till unfini&s;hed; we then went to Franckfort without it, and it was &s;ent after us by a friend. This was the mo&s;t aggravated in&s;tance we &s;aw of a German trader's manners; but &s;omething like it may be almo&s;t every where met with.</P>
<P>From &s;uch &s;ymptoms and from the infrequency of wealth among
<PB N="220" REF="228">
the middle cla&s;&s;es it is apparent, that Mentz could not have been im|portant, as to commerce, even if there had been no &s;iege, which is here mentioned as the cau&s;e of all deficiencies, and certainly is &s;o of many. The de&s;truction of property, occa&s;ioned by it, will not be &s;oon remedied. The nobility have almo&s;t for&s;aken a place, where their palaces have been either de&s;troyed, or ran&s;acked; the Prince has no re&s;idence there; &s;ome of the Germans, who emigrated on account of the la&s;t &s;iege, fled into France; the war-taxes, as well as the partial maintenance of the garri&s;on, dimini&s;h what property re|mains; and all expenditure is upon a reduced footing.</P>
<P>The contribution of the inhabitants towards a &s;upport of the garri|&s;on is made by the very irk&s;ome means of affording them lodging. At the be&s;t hou&s;es, the doors are chalked over with the names of officers, lodged in them; which the &s;ervants dare not efface, for the &s;oldiers mu&s;t know where to find their officers. In a family, whom we vi&s;ited, four officers and their &s;ervants were quartered; but it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the former, &s;o far from adding to this incon|venience by any negligent conduct, were con&s;tantly and carefully polite. We, indeed, never &s;aw Pru&s;&s;ian officers otherwi&s;e; and can te&s;tify, that they are as much &s;uperior to tho&s;e Au&s;trians in manners and intelligence, as they are u&s;ually &s;aid to be in military qualities.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;truction, which the &s;iege has given to the pro&s;perity of Mentz, con&s;i&s;ts in the ab&s;ence of many members of the Noble Chapter; an in&s;titution, which, however u&s;ele&s;s, or injurious to the country occa&s;ions the expenditure of con&s;iderable &s;ums in the capi|tal.
<PB N="221" REF="229">
That of Mentz is &s;aid to be one of the riche&s;t of many &s;imilar Chapters in Germany. From &s;uch foundations the younger &s;ons of noble families derive &s;ometimes very ample incomes, and are but little re&s;tricted by their regulations from any enjoyment of temporal &s;plen|dour. Their carriages and liveries vie with tho&s;e of the other attend|ants at Court; they are not prohibited from wearing the ornaments of orders of knighthood; are very little enjoined to re&s;idence; are received in the environs of the Court with military honours, and allowed to re&s;ide in their &s;eparate hou&s;es. They may wear embroi|dery of gold, and cloths of any colours, except &s;carlet, or green, which, as well as &s;ilver lace, are thought too gay. Being thus per|mitted and enabled to become examples of luxury, their re&s;idence in any city diffu&s;es &s;ome appearance of pro&s;perity over it.</P>
<P>One of the large&s;t buildings in Mentz is the ar&s;enal, which fronts towards the river, and attracts the attention of tho&s;e, who walk upon the quay, by having armed heads placed at the windows of the fir&s;t floor, which &s;eem to frown, with Roman &s;ternne&s;s, upon the pa&s;&s;en|ger. In one of the principal rooms within, a party of figures in &s;imilar armour are placed at a council-board. We did not hear who contrived them; but the heads in the windows may be mi&s;taken for real ones, at the di&s;tance of fifty yards.</P>
<P>The Elector of Mentz, who is cho&s;en by a Chapter of twenty-four Canons, and is u&s;ually one of their number, is the fir&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical Prince in the empire, of which he is al&s;o the Arch-chancellor and Di|rector of the Electoral College. In the Diet, he &s;its on the right hand
<PB N="222" REF="230">
of the Emperor, affixes the &s;eal of the Empire to its decrees, and has afterwards the cu&s;tody of them among the archives. His revenues, in a time of peace, are nearly 200,000 l. annually; but, during a war, they are much le&s;s, a third part of them ari&s;ing from tolls, impo&s;ed upon the navigation of the Rhine. The vineyards &s;upply another large part; and his &s;ubjects, not intere&s;ted in them, are but little taxed, except when military preparations are to be made; the taxes are then as direct as po&s;&s;ible, that money may be immediately col|lected.</P>
<P>The fortifications of his chief city are as much a misfortune to his country as they are an advantage to the re&s;t of the Empire. Being always one of the fir&s;t objects, on this &s;ide of the Rhine, &s;ince an enemy cannot cro&s;s the river, while &s;o con&s;iderable a fortre&s;s and &s;o large a garri&s;on as it may contain, might, perhaps, check their return, the Electorate has been often the &s;cene of a tedious warfare. From the fir&s;t rai&s;ing of the works by Louis the Fourteenth, their &s;trength has never been fully tried. The &s;urrender in 1792 was partly for the want of a proper garri&s;on, and partly by contrivance; even in 1793, when the defence was &s;o furious and long, the garri&s;on, it is thought, might have held out further, if their &s;tores had been &s;ecured in bomb|proof buildings. A German garri&s;on, &s;upported by an army, which &s;hould occupy the oppo&s;ite bank of the Rhine, might be continually reinforced and &s;upplied, &s;o as to be conquered by nothing but the ab&s;olute demolition of the walls.</P>
<P>The bridge of boats over the Rhine, which, both in peace and war,
<PB N="223" REF="231">
is &s;o important to the city, is now in a much better &s;tate than the French found it, being guarded, at the ea&s;tern end, by the fortifica|tions of Ca&s;&s;el. Notwith&s;tanding its great length and the rapidity of the river, it is &s;o well con&s;tructed, as to be much le&s;s liable to injury, than might be &s;uppo&s;ed, and would probably &s;u&s;tain batteries, which might defeat every attempt at de&s;troying it by fire&s;hips. It is 766 feet long, and wide enough for the pa&s;&s;age of two carriages at once. Various repairs, and the care of a daily &s;urvey, have continued it, &s;ince 1661, when it was thrown over the river.</P>
<P>The practice of modifying the names of towns &s;o as to incorporate them &s;eparately with every language, is no where more remarkable than with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of Germany, where a &s;tranger, unle&s;s he is aware of them, might find the variations very inconvenient. The German name for what we call Mentz, is <HI>Maynz;</HI> the French, which is mo&s;t u&s;ed, <HI>Mayence;</HI> and the Italian <HI>Magontio,</HI> by de&s;cent from the Roman <HI>Magontiacum.</HI> The German &s;ynonym for Liege is <HI>Luttich;</HI> for Aix la Chapelle, <HI>Achen;</HI> for Bois le Duc, <HI>Herzogen|bu&s;ch;</HI> and for Cologne, <HI>C&ouml;ln,</HI> which is pronounced <HI>Keln.</HI> The name, borne by every town in the nation to which it belongs, &s;hould &s;urely be its name, wherever it is mentioned; for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that words, derived into one language from another, are pronounced ac|cording to the authority of their roots, becau&s;e the u&s;e of the primary term is already e&s;tabli&s;hed, and there can never be a deci&s;ion between &s;ub&s;equent varieties, which are cotemporary among them&s;elves, and are each produced by the &s;ame arrogance of invention.</P>

<HEAD>FRANCKFORT.</HEAD>
<P>WE came hither by means of a pa&s;&s;age boat, which we were told would &s;hew &s;omething of the German populace, but which di&s;played nothing &s;o much as the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the German &s;ailors. Though they make this voyage, every day, they went aground in the even &s;tream of the Maine, and during the calme&s;t weather; fixing the ve&s;&s;el &s;o fa&s;t by their ill-directed &s;truggle to get off, that they were compelled to bring the towing hor&s;es to the &s;ide and tug backward with the &s;tream. There were an hundred people in the boat; but the expedient of de&s;iring them to remove from the part, which was aground, was never u&s;ed. We heard, that they &s;eldom make the voyage, without a &s;imilar &s;toppage, not again&s;t any &s;hifting &s;and, but upon the permanent &s;helves of the river.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance is about four-and-twenty miles, but we were nine hours in reaching Franckfort, the environs of which afford &s;ome &s;ymptoms of a commercial and opulent city, the banks of the Maine being covered for nearly the la&s;t mile with country &s;eats, &s;eparated from each other by &s;mall plea&s;ure grounds.</P>
<P>There are gates and walls to Franckfort, but the magi&s;trates do not oppre&s;s travellers by a military examination at their entrance. Having &s;een the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of many places, which bear o&s;tentatious cha|racters either for &s;plendour or trade, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to find in this
<PB N="225" REF="233">
as much of both as had been reported. The quays were well covered with goods and labourers; the &s;treets neare&s;t to the water are lined with &s;hops, and tho&s;e in the middle of the city with the hou&s;es of merchants, of which nearly all are &s;pacious, and many magnificent. Some, indeed, might be called palaces, if they had nobility for their tenants; but, though the independence, which commerce &s;preads among the middle cla&s;&s;es, does not entirely deter the German nobility from a re&s;idence here, the fine&s;t hou&s;es are the property of merchants.</P>
<P>In our way to the <HI>Cigne Blanc,</HI> which is one of the be&s;t inns, we pa&s;&s;ed many of &s;o good an appearance, that it was difficult to believe there could be better in a German city. But Franckfort, which is the pride of Germany, in this re&s;pect, has probably a greater number of large inns than any other place of equal extent in Europe. The fairs fill the&s;e, twice in a year, for three weeks, at each time; and the order, which is indi&s;pen&s;ible then, continues at other periods, to the &s;urpri&s;e and comfort of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>This city has been ju&s;tly de&s;cribed by many travellers; and Doctor MOORE has treated of its inhabitants with the ea&s;e and elegant ani|mation of his peculiar manner. We &s;hall not a&s;&s;ume the di&s;advan|tage of entering upon the &s;ame &s;ubject after him. The inhabitants of Franckfort are very di&s;tinct, as to manners and information, from the other Germans; but they are &s;o far like to tho&s;e of our own com|mercial cities, that one able account leaves &s;carcely any thing new to be &s;een, or told, concerning them.</P>
<P>All their ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, intelligence, and wealth are ob&s;erved
<PB N="226" REF="234">
with the more attention, becau&s;e they cannot be approached, except through countries afflicted by arbitrary power, ignorance and poverty. The exi&s;tence of &s;uch a city, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, is little le&s;s than a <HI>phenomenon;</HI> the cau&s;es of which are &s;o various and minute as to make the effect, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear almo&s;t accidental. The jea|lou&s;y of the neighbouring Princes towards each other, is the known, and, certainly, the chief cau&s;e of its exterior protection again&s;t each; the continuance of its interior liberties is probably owing to the cir|cum&s;tance, which, but for that jealou&s;y, would expo&s;e it to &s;ubjection from without,&mdash;the &s;mallne&s;s of its territory. Where the departments of government mu&s;t be very few, very difficult to be rendered ex|pen&s;ive to the public, and very near to their in&s;pection, the ambition of individuals can be but little tempted to contrive encroachments upon the community. So complexly are the chief cau&s;es of its exterior and interior independence connected with each other.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, it may, perhaps, be replied, that a &s;imilar jealou&s;y has not always been &s;ufficient to protect &s;imilar cities; and Dantzick is the recent in&s;tance of its in&s;ufficiency. But the jealou&s;y, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s to Dantzick, though &s;imilar, was not equal to this, and the tempta|tion to oppo&s;e it was con&s;iderably greater. What would the mo&s;t capable of the neighbouring Princes gain by the &s;eizure of Franck|fort? A place of &s;trength? No. A place capable of paying taxes? Yes; but taxes, which would be re-impo&s;ed upon commodities, con&s;umed partly by his own &s;ubjects, who&s;e property is his own already, and partly by tho&s;e of his neighbours, to who&s;e jealou&s;y they would afford
<PB N="227" REF="235">
an additional and an unappea&s;able provocation. Dantzick, on the contrary, being a &s;eaport, was, if not &s;trong, capable of &s;upplying &s;trength, and might pay taxes, which &s;hould not fall entirely upon its neighbours, but upon the di&s;tant countries, that traffick with it. And even to the&s;e con&s;iderations it is unnece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort, unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e, that de&s;poti&s;m would have no effect upon commerce; a &s;up|po&s;ition which does not require to be refuted. If a &s;evere taxation was introduced here, and, in &s;o &s;mall a di&s;trict, taxation mu&s;t be &s;evere to be productive; if &s;uch a taxation was to be introduced, and if the other advantage of conque&s;t, that of a forcible levy of &s;oldiers, was attempted, commerce would vani&s;h in &s;ilence before the oppre&s;&s;or, and the Prince, that &s;hould &s;eize the liberties of Franckfort, would find nothing but tho&s;e liberties in his gra&s;p.</P>
<P>On the other hand, what are the advantages of permitting the independence of &s;uch a city to the &s;overeigns, who have the power of violating it? Tho&s;e of a neutral barrier are well known, but apply only to military, or political circum&s;tances. The others are the mar|ket, which Franckfort affords, for the produce and manufactures of all the neighbouring &s;tates; its value as a banking <HI>dep&ocirc;t</HI> and <HI>empo|rium,</HI> in which Princes may place their money, without rendering it liable to the orders of each other, or from which they may derive loans, by negotiating &s;olely and directly with the lenders; its inca|pacity for offen&s;ive mea&s;ures; and its u&s;efulne&s;s as a place of meeting to them&s;elves, or their mini&s;ters, when political connections are to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="236">
That the inhabitants do enjoy this independence without and free|dom within, we believe, not becau&s;e they are a&s;&s;erted by treaties, or political forms; of which the former might not have &s;urvived the temporary intere&s;ts, that concluded them, and the latter might be &s;ub|dued by corruption, if there were the means of it; but becau&s;e they were acknowledged to us by many temperate and di&s;cerning per&s;ons, as much aloof from faction, as they were from the affectation, or &s;er|vility, that &s;ometimes makes men boa&s;t them&s;elves free, only becau&s;e they have, or would be thought to have, a little &s;hare in oppre&s;&s;ing others. Many &s;uch per&s;ons declared to us, that they had a &s;ub&s;tan|tial, practical freedom; and we thought a te&s;timony to their actual enjoyments more valuable than any formal acknowledgments of their rights. As to the&s;e latter &s;ecurities, indeed, Franckfort is no better provided than other imperial cities, which have proved their inuti|lity. It &s;tands in the &s;ame li&s;t with Cologne, but is as &s;uperior to it in government as in wealth.</P>
<P>The inhabitants having had the good &s;en&s;e to fore&s;ee, that fortifi|cations might render them a more de&s;irable prize to their neighbours, at the &s;ame time that their real protection mu&s;t depend upon other means, have done little more than &s;u&s;tain their antient walls, which are &s;ufficient to defend them again&s;t a &s;urpri&s;e by &s;mall parties. They maintain no troops, except a few companies of city-guards, and make their contributions to the army of the Empire in &s;pecie. The&s;e companies are filled chiefly with middle-aged men, who&s;e appearance be&s;peaks the plenty and peacefulne&s;s of the city. Their uniforms,
<PB N="229" REF="237">
blue and white, are of the cut of tho&s;e in the prints of MARLBO|ROUGH'S days; and their grenadiers' caps are of the &s;ame peaked &s;ort, with tin facings, impre&s;&s;ed with the city arms.</P>
<P>In wars with France, the fate of Franckfort has u&s;ually depended upon that of Mentz, which is properly called the key of Germany, on the we&s;tern frontier. In the campaign of 1792, Cu&s;tine detached 3000 troops of the 11,000, with which he had be&s;ieged Mentz, and the&s;e reached Franckfort, early in the morning of the 22d of October. NEUWINGER, their commander, &s;ent a letter to the magi&s;trates from Cu&s;tine, demanding a contribution of two millions of florins, which, by a negotiation at Mentz, was reduced to a million and a half, for the pre&s;ent. Notice was accordingly given in the city, that the magi&s;trates would receive money at four per cent. intere&s;t, and, on the 23d, at break of day, it began to flow in to the Council-hou&s;e from all quarters. Part was immediately given to NEUWINGER, but payment of the re&s;t was delayed; &s;o that Cu&s;tine came him&s;elf on the 27th, and, by throwing the ho&s;tages into pri&s;on, obtained, on the 31&s;t of October, the remainder of the fir&s;t million. For the &s;econd, the magi&s;trates gave &s;ecurity to NEUWINGER, but it was never paid; the Convention di&s;avowed great part of the proceedings of Cu&s;tine, and the money was not again demanded.</P>
<P>The French, during the whole of their &s;tay, were very eager to &s;pread exaggerated accounts of their numbers. Troops were accord|ingly marched out at one gate of the city, with very little parade, that they might enter with much pomp and in a longer column, at
<PB N="230" REF="238">
the other. The inhabitants, who were not expert at military nume|ration, ea&s;ily believed, that the fir&s;t party had joined other troops, and that the whole amounted to treble their real number. After the entry of the Pru&s;&s;ians, this contrivance was related by pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The number of troops, left in the city by Cu&s;tine, on his retire|ment from the neighbouring po&s;ts, in the latter end of November, was 1800 men, with two pieces of cannon. On the 28th, when the Pru&s;&s;ian Lieutenant Pellet brought a &s;ummons to &s;urrender, Helden, the commander, having &s;ent to Cu&s;tine for reinforcements and can|non, was an&s;wered, that no men could be &s;pared; and that, as to cannon, he might u&s;e the city artillery. Helden endeavoured to re|move this from the ar&s;enal; but the populace, encouraged by the neighbourhood of the Pru&s;&s;ians, ro&s;e to prevent him; and there might have been a con&s;iderable tumult, if Cu&s;tine had not arrived, on the 29th, and a&s;&s;ured the magi&s;trates, that the garri&s;on &s;hould retire, rather than expo&s;e the place to a &s;iege. The city then became tran|quil, and remained &s;o till the 2d of December, when the inhabitants, being in church, fir&s;t knew by the noi&s;e of cannon, that the place was attacked.</P>
<P>General Helden would then have taken his two cannon to the gate, which was contended for, but the inhabitants, remembering Cu&s;tine's promi&s;e, would permit no re&s;i&s;tance; they cut the harne&s;s of the hor&s;es, broke the cannon wheels, and them&s;elves opened the gates to the Pru&s;&s;ians, or rather to the He&s;&s;ians, for the advanced corps of the a&s;&s;ailants was chiefly formed of them. About 100 fell
<PB N="231" REF="239">
in this attack. Of the French 41 were killed; 139 wounded; and 800 taken pri&s;oners. The remainder of the 1800 reached Cu&s;tine's army. A monument, erected without the northern gate of the city, commemorates the lo&s;s of the 100 a&s;&s;ailants, on the &s;pot, on which they fell.</P>
<P>Thus Franckfort, having happily but few fortifications, was lo&s;t and regained, without a &s;iege; while Mentz, in a period of &s;ix more months, had nearly all its be&s;t buildings de&s;troyed, by a &s;imilar change of ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed here almo&s;t a week, which was well occupied by vi&s;its, but &s;hewed nothing in addition to what is already known of the &s;ociety of the place. Manners, cu&s;toms, the topics of conver&s;ation and even dre&s;s, differ very &s;lightly from tho&s;e of London, in &s;imilar ranks; the merchants of Franckfort have more generally the advan|tages of travel, than tho&s;e of England, but they have not that minute knowledge of modern events and characters, which an attention to public tran&s;actions renders common in our i&s;land. Tho&s;e, who have been in England, or who &s;peak Engli&s;h, &s;eem de&s;irous to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;tate of parliamentary tran&s;actions and intere&s;ts, and to remedy the thinne&s;s of their own public topics, by introducing ours. In &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions one error is very general from their want of experience. The faculty of making a &s;peech is taken for the &s;tandard of intellec|tual power in every &s;ort of exertion; though there is nothing better known in countries, where public &s;peakers are numerous enough to be often ob&s;erved, than that per&s;ons may be educated to oratory, &s;o as to
<PB N="232" REF="240">
have a facility, elegance and force in it, di&s;tinct from the endow|ments of deliberative wi&s;dom; may be taught to &s;peak in terms remote from common u&s;e, to combine them with an unfailing dexterity of ar|rangement, and to inve&s;t every thought with its portion of artificial dignity, who, through the chaos of benefits and evils, which the agita|tion of difficult times throws up before the eye of the politician, &s;hall be able to &s;ee no gleam of light, to de&s;cribe no direct path, to di&s;cern no difference between greater and le&s;&s;er evils, nor to think one whole|&s;ome truth for a confiding and an hone&s;t country. To e&s;timate the general intellectual powers of men, tutored to oratory, from their &s;uc|ce&s;s in the practice of it, is as ab&s;urd as to judge of corporeal &s;trength from that of one arm, which may have been rendered unu&s;ually &s;trong by exerci&s;e and art.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ociety at Franckfort, Me&s;&s;rs. Bethman, the chief bankers, &s;eem able to collect a valuable part; and their politene&s;s to &s;trangers induces them to do it often. A traveller, who mi&s;&s;es their table, lo&s;es, both as to conver&s;ation and elegant ho&s;pitality, a welcome proof of what freedom and commerce can do again&s;t the mental and phy&s;i|cal de&s;olation otherwi&s;e &s;pread over the country.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which the mutual u&s;e of languages gives to a con|nection between di&s;tant places, we were happy to &s;ee exi&s;ting and increa&s;ing, to the advantage of England, at Franckfort. At the Me&s;&s;rs. Bethmans', one day, French was nearly excluded, the majo|rity being able to conver&s;e with nine or ten Engli&s;h, who were there, in their own language. Of the merchants, who have not been in
<PB N="233" REF="241">
England, &s;everal &s;peak Engli&s;h, without difficulty, and the ri&s;ing generation, it is &s;aid, will be generally accompli&s;hed in it.</P>
<P>One of the luxuries of Franckfort is a <HI>Cabinet Literaire,</HI> which is open to &s;trangers by the introduction of members. There the be&s;t periodical publications of the Continent are received, and their titles immediately entered in a book, &s;o that the reading is not di&s;turbed by conver&s;ation with the librarian. It excited our &s;hame to hear, that &s;ome contrivance had, for &s;everal months, prevented the &s;ociety from receiving a very valuable Engli&s;h publication.</P>
<P>After this, the Theatre may &s;eem to require &s;ome notice. It is a modern, but not an elegant building, &s;tanding in an area, that renders it convenient of acce&s;s, and nearly in the middle of the city. The interior, which has been gaudily decorated, contains a pit, three rows of boxes, that &s;urround the audience part, and a gallery over them in the centre. It is larger than the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, and, in form, re&s;embles that of Covent Garden, except that &s;ix or &s;even of the central boxes, in each tier, encroach upon the oval figure by a projection over the pit. The boxes are let by the year; the price of admi&s;&s;ion for non-&s;ub&s;cribers, is a florin, for which they may find places in the boxes, engaged by their friends, or in the pit, which is in the &s;ame proportion of e&s;teem as that at an Opera-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The performances are plays and operas alternately; both in Ger|man; and the mu&s;ic of the latter chiefly by German compo&s;ers. The players are very far beneath mediocrity; but the orche&s;tra, when we heard it, accorded with the fame of German mu&s;icians, for &s;pirit and
<PB N="234" REF="242">
preci&s;ion. In the&s;e qualities even the wandering parties, that play at inns, are very &s;eldom deficient.</P>
<P>The &s;tage was well lighted, but the other parts of the theatre were left in du&s;kine&s;s, which &s;carcely permitted us to &s;ee the diamonds, profu&s;ely worn by &s;everal ladies. Six o'clock is the hour of begin|ning, and the performances conclude &s;oon after nine.</P>
<P>The Cabinet Literaire and the Theatre are the only permanent places of public amu&s;ement at Franckfort, which is, however, in want of no more, the inhabitants being accu&s;tomed to pa&s;s much of their time in friendly parties, at their hou&s;es. Though wealth is, of cour&s;e, earne&s;tly and univer&s;ally &s;ought for in a place purely mercantile, we were a&s;&s;ured, that the riche&s;t per&s;ons, and there are &s;ome, who have above half a million &s;terling, find no more attention in the&s;e parties than others. This was acknowledged and &s;eparately boa&s;ted of by &s;ome of the very rich, and by tho&s;e who were comparatively poor. We are &s;o far able to report it for true, as that we could never di&s;cern the lea&s;t traces of the officiou&s;ne&s;s, or &s;ub&s;erviency that, in a corrupt and deba&s;ed &s;tate of &s;ociety, frequently point to the wealthie&s;t individuals in every private party.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other circum&s;tances would probably render Franckfort a place of re&s;idence for foreigners, if the magi&s;trates, either dreading the increa&s;e of luxury, or the interference of &s;trangers with their commerce, did not prevent this by prohibiting them from being lodged otherwi&s;e than at inns. It was with difficulty, that an Engli&s;h officer, acting as Commi&s;&s;ary to &s;ome of the German regi|ments,
<PB N="235" REF="243">
lately rai&s;ed upon our pay, could obtain an exemption from this rule, at the reque&s;t of the Hanoverian Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Round the city, are &s;everal well-di&s;po&s;ed walks, as plea&s;ant as the flatne&s;s of the nearer country will permit; and, at intervals, along the&s;e, are the country hou&s;es of the merchants, who do not choo&s;e to go beyond the city territories, for a re&s;idence. Saxenhau&s;en, a &s;mall town, on the other &s;ide of the Maine, though incorporated with Franckfort, as to juri&s;diction, and connected with it by a bridge, is chiefly inhabited by watermen and other labourers.</P>
<P>We left Franckfort, after a &s;tay of &s;ix days, fortified by a German pa&s;&s;port from M. de Swartzhoff, the Hanoverian Mini&s;ter, who obli|gingly advi&s;ed us to be prepared with one in the native language of the Au&s;trian officers. At Mentz, the ceremonies of examination were rendered much more trouble&s;ome than before, the Governor, General Kalkreuth, happening to be in the great &s;quare, who cho&s;e to make &s;everal travellers wait as if for a &s;ort of review before him, though, after all, nothing was to be &s;aid but <Q REND="inline">"Go to the Comman|dant, who will look at your pa&s;&s;ports."</Q> This Commandant was M. de Lucadou, a gentleman of con&s;iderate and polite manners, who, knowing our friends in Mentz, added to his confirmation of M. de Swartzhoff's pa&s;&s;port an addre&s;s to M. de Wilde, the Intendant of &s;ome &s;alt mines in Switzerland, which he recommended to us to &s;ee. The&s;e circum&s;tances are nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned here, becau&s;e they &s;oon led to a di&s;agreeable and very contradictory event in our journey.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="244">
The next morning, we &s;et out from Mentz, and were conducted by our voiturier over a &s;ummer road, on the left bank of the Rhine, then flowing with the melted &s;nows of Switzerland.</P>

<HEAD>OPPENHEIM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the fir&s;t town of the Palatinate, on arriving from the north; and it bears marks of the deva&s;tation, inflicted upon that country, in the la&s;t century, more flagrant than could be expected, when the length of the intervening time, and the complete recovery of other cities from &s;imilar di&s;a&s;ters, are con&s;idered. Louis the Four|teenth's fury has converted it from a populous city into little more than a picture&s;que ruin. It was burned in 1668; and the walls, which remain in double, or &s;ometimes in treble circles, are more vi&s;ible, at a di&s;tance, than the &s;treets, which have been thinly erected within them. Above all, is the <HI>Land&s;croon,</HI> or crown of the coun|try, a ca&s;tle erected on an eminence, which commands the Rhine, and digni&s;ies the view from it, for &s;everal miles. The whole city, or rather ruin, &s;tands on a brow, over this maje&s;tic river.</P>
<P>The gates do not now open directly into &s;treets, but into lanes of &s;tone walls between vineyards and gardens, formed on the &s;ite of hou&s;es, never re&s;tored, &s;ince the fire. The town it&s;elf has &s;hrunk from its antient limits into a few &s;treets in the centre. In &s;ome of the inter&s;tices, corn grows up to the walls of the pre&s;ent hou&s;es. In
<PB N="237" REF="245">
others, the ruins of former buildings remain, which the owners have not been tempted to remove, for the &s;ake of cultivating their &s;ites. Of the cathedral, &s;aid to have been once the fine&s;t on the Rhine, nearly all the walls and the tower &s;till exi&s;t; but the&s;e are the only remains of grandeur in a city, which &s;eems entirely incapable of overcoming in this century the wretchedne&s;s it inherits from the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Had the walls been as &s;trong as they are exten&s;ive, this place might not improbably have endured a &s;iege in the pre&s;ent age, having been &s;everal times lo&s;t and regained. It was &s;urrendered to the French, without a conte&s;t, in the campaign of 1792. After their retreat from Worms, and during the &s;iege of Mentz, it was occupied by the Pru&s;&s;ians; and, in December 1793, when the allies retired from Al&s;ace, the Duke of Brun&s;wick e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters in it, for the purpo&s;e of covering the fortre&s;s. His army ovens remained near the northern gate, in July 1794, when we pa&s;&s;ed through it. In October of the fame year it fell again into the hands of the French.</P>
<P>No city on the banks of the Rhine is &s;o well &s;eated for affording a view of it as this, which, to the north, overlooks all its windings as far as Mentz, and, &s;outhward, commands them towards Worms. The river is al&s;o here of a noble breadth and force, beating &s;o vehe|mently again&s;t the water-mills, moored near the &s;ide, that they &s;eem likely to be borne away with the current. A city might be built on the &s;ite of Oppenheim, which &s;hould faintly rival the ca&s;tle of Goode&s;|berg, in the richne&s;s, though not in the &s;ublimity of its pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>From hence the road leads through a fertile country of corn and

<PB N="238" REF="246">
vines, but at a greater di&s;tance from the river, to Worms, five or &s;ix miles from which it becomes broad, &s;traight, and bordered with regu|larly-planted trees, that form an avenue to the city. Soon after leav|ing Oppenheim, we had the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of an approach to the immediate theatre of the war, meeting a waggon, loaded with wounded &s;oldiers. On this road, there was a long train of carriages, taking &s;tores to &s;ome military <HI>dep&ocirc;t.</HI> The defacement of the Elec|tor's arms, on po&s;ts near the road, &s;hewed al&s;o, that the country had been lately occupied by the French; as the delay in cutting the ripe corn did, that there was little expectation of their return.</P>

<HEAD>WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE condition of Worms is an aggravated repetition of the wretchedne&s;s of Oppenheim. It &s;uffered &s;omething in the war, which the unfortunate Elector, &s;on-in-law of our James the Fir&s;t, provoked by accepting the kingdom of Bohemia. Louis the Four|teenth came upon it next, and, in 1669, burned every thing that could be con&s;umed. Nothing was re&s;tored, but on that part, which was the centre of the antient city; and the walls include, as at Oppenheim, corn and vineyards upon the ground, which was once covered with hou&s;es, and which plainly appears to have been &s;o, from the lanes that pa&s;s between, and doors that open into the inclo&s;ures. A much larger &s;pace is &s;o covered, than at Oppen|heim,
<PB N="239" REF="247">
for you are &s;ome time in driving from the northern gate of the old city to the fir&s;t &s;treet of the pre&s;ent one.</P>
<P>On the right of the road &s;tands the &s;keleton of the Electoral palace, which the French burned in one of the late campaigns; and it is as curious as melancholy to ob&s;erve how the &s;igns of antient and modern de&s;olation mingle with each other. On one hand is a palace, burned by the pre&s;ent French; on the other, the walls of a church, laid open by Louis the Fourteenth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and principal &s;treet of theplace leads through the&s;e min|gled ruins, and through rows of dirty hou&s;es, mi&s;erably tenanted, to the other end of the city. A few others branch from it, chiefly towards the Rhine, including &s;ometimes the ruins, and &s;ometimes the repaired parts of churches; of which &s;treets, narrow, ill-paved and gloomy, con&s;i&s;ts the city of Worms. The French General, that lately wrote to Paris, <Q REND="inline">"We entered the fair epi&s;copal city of Worms,"</Q> may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived his terms from a geographical dictionary, rather than from a view of his conque&s;t.</P>
<P>We were now in a place, occupied by part of the acting army of the allies, which, if not immediately liable to be attacked, was to be defended by the maintenance of po&s;ts, at a very &s;hort di&s;tance. Troops pa&s;&s;ed through it daily, for the &s;ervice of the&s;e po&s;ts. The noi&s;e of every cannonade was audible, and the re&s;ult of every engagement was immediately known, for it might make an advance, or a retreat nece&s;&s;ary from Worms. The wounded men arrived, &s;oon after the intelligence, to the military ho&s;pitals of the Pru&s;&s;ians. A city, &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced,
<PB N="240" REF="248">
&s;eemed to differ but little from a camp; and we were aware, for a few hours, of a departure from the &s;ecurity and order of civil life.</P>
<P>The inn, which was not otherwi&s;e a mean building, was nearly de&s;titute of furniture; &s;o that the owner was prepared to receive any &s;ort of gue&s;ts, or ma&s;ters. The only provi&s;ion, which we could ob|tain was bread, the commone&s;t &s;ort of wine, and one piece of cold veal; for the city was under military juri&s;diction, and no gue&s;ts were allowed to have more than one di&s;h at their table.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we &s;aw, for the fir&s;t time, a crowd in a German city. A narrow waggon, of which nearly all but the wheels was ba&s;ket-work, had arrived from the army, with a wounded officer, who lay upon the floor, &s;upported by his &s;ervant, but occa&s;ionally ro&s;e to return the &s;alutes of pa&s;&s;engers. This was the Prince of An|halt Ple&s;&s;is, who had been wounded, in the morning, when the French attacked all the neighbouring lines of the allies, and an inde|ci&s;ive engagement en&s;ued, the noi&s;e of which had been di&s;tinctly heard, at Worms. He was hurt in the leg, and de&s;cended, with much difficulty, from the waggon; but did not, for an in&s;tant, lo&s;e the elegance of his addre&s;s, and continued bowing through the pa&s;&s;age to his apartment. No doubt was entertained of his recovery, but there &s;eemed to be a con&s;iderable degree of &s;ympathy, attending this young man.</P>
<P>We had not time to look into the churches, or numerous mona&s;|teries, that yet remain, at Worms; the war appeared to have depo|pulated
<PB N="241" REF="249">
the latter, for not a monk was to be &s;een. The cathedral, or church of St. Mary and St. Peter, is one of the mo&s;t antient &s;acred buildings in Germany, having been founded at lea&s;t as early as the commencement of the &s;eventh century. One of the prebends was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1033, another in 1058. The Dominicans, Carmelites, Capuchins and Augu&s;tines have each a mona&s;tery, at Worms; as have the Ci&s;tercians and the Augu&s;tines a nunnery. A Prote&s;tant church was al&s;o con&s;ecrated, on the 9th of June 1744; &s;omething more than two hundred years, after the ineffectual conference held here of Prote&s;tant and Catholic divines, which Charles the Fifth inter|rupted, when Melancthon, on one &s;ide, and Echius, on the other, had engaged in it, ordering them to re&s;ume their arguments, in his pre|&s;ence, at Rati&s;bon. This meeting was five years previous to the celebrated diet of Worms, at which Charles, having then e&s;timated the temporal &s;trength of the two parties, openly &s;hewed his animo&s;ity to the Prote&s;tants, as Maurice of Saxony did his intriguing ambition, by referring the que&s;tion to the Council of Trent.</P>
<P>The Jews, at Worms, inhabit a &s;eparate &s;treet, and have a &s;yna|gogue, of great antiquity, their numbers having been once &s;uch as to endanger the peace of the city; but, in 1689, when the French turned their &s;ynagogue into a &s;table, they fled with the re&s;t of the opu|lent inhabitants to Holland.

Here too George the Second held his head|quarters, from the 7th to the 20th of September 1743; on the 14th of which month, Lord Carteret concluded, in his name, an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive treaty with the Mini&s;ters of Hungary and Sardinia.</P>
<P>This city, like Cologne, retains &s;ome affectation of the Roman form of government, to which it was rendered &s;ubject by Cae&s;ar, with the title of <HI>Augu&s;ta Vangionum.</HI> The STADTMEISTER is &s;ometimes called the CONSUL, and the SCHULTHEIS, or Mayor, the PRAETOR. But, in 1703, &s;ome trivial tumult afforded a pretence for aboli&s;hing its little remains of liberty, and the Elector Palatine was declared its protector. This blow completed the de&s;olation, which the di&s;a&s;ters of the preceding century had commenced; and a city, that was once called the market of the Palatinate, as the Palatinate was reputed the market of Germany, continues to exhibit nothing more than the ruins of its antient pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Few of the pre&s;ent inhabitants can be the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e, who witne&s;&s;ed its de&s;truction in 1689; for we could not find, that the particulars of that event were much known, or commemorated by them, dreadful and impre&s;&s;ive as they mu&s;t have been. A column of Louis the Fourteenth's army had entered the city, in September of the preceding year, under the command of the Marquis de Bon|fleur, who &s;oon di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the inhabitants by preparations for blow|ing
<PB N="243" REF="251">
up the walls with gunpowder. The mines were &s;o numerous and large, as to threaten nothing le&s;s than the entire overwhelming of the city; but, being fired at different times, the walls of the hou&s;es were left &s;tanding, though they &s;hook with almo&s;t every explo&s;ion. The artillery and balls had been previou&s;ly carried away to Landau, or Mentz, then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Louis. At length, on the 12th of May 1689, the Intendant &s;ent the melancholy news to the magi&s;tracy, that he had received orders from his monarch to burn the whole city. Six days were allowed for the departure of the inhabitants and the removal of their property; which period was prolonged by their entreaties to nineteen. At the expiration of the&s;e, on A&s;cen&s;ion Day, the 31&s;t of May, the French grenadiers were employed from twelve o'clock, till four, in placing combu&s;tibles about the hou&s;es and public buildings, again&s;t &s;everal of which large heaps of hay and &s;traw were rai&s;ed. The word being then given, fire was &s;et to almo&s;t every hou&s;e at once, and, in a few hours, the city was reduced to a&s;hes; the conflagration being &s;o general and &s;trong as to be vi&s;ible in day|light at the di&s;tance of more than thirty Engli&s;h miles. Such was one of the calamities of a city, &s;o unfortunately &s;ituated, that the chapter of the cathedral alone proved a lo&s;s by wars, previous to the year 1743, amounting to 1,262,749 florins.</P>

<HEAD>FRANCKENTHAL,</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER place, de&s;troyed by Louis the Fourteenth, but re&s;tored upon a plan &s;o uniform and convenient, that nothing but a fuller population is nece&s;&s;ary to confirm its title of a flouri&s;hing city. The &s;treets, which inter&s;ect each other at right angles, are wide and exactly &s;traight; the hou&s;es are hand&s;omely built, but the poverty, or indolence of the owners &s;uffers them to partake of the air of neglect, which is general in German habitations; and the &s;treets, though &s;pacious and not ill-paved, had &s;o few pa&s;&s;engers, that the depopulation of the place &s;eemed to be rendered the more ob&s;ervable by its grandeur.</P>
<P>Yet it would be unfair to e&s;timate the general pro&s;perity of Franck|enthal by its pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, even had we &s;tayed long enough to know them more accurately. This place had been occupied but a few weeks before by the French army, who had plundered it, as well as &s;everal other towns of the Palatinate, after the retreat of the allies from Al&s;ace, at the latter end of 1793. The inhabitants had, for the mo&s;t part, returned to their hou&s;es; but their commerce, which is &s;aid to have been not contemptible, could not be &s;o ea&s;ily re&s;tored. The manufactures of porcelain, cloths, &s;ilks, &s;pangles, vinegar and &s;oap, of which &s;ome were e&s;tabli&s;hed and all are protected by the wi&s;e libera|lity of the Elector, though far from being an&s;werable, either in their

capitals, or produce, to the Engli&s;h idea of &s;imilar enterpri&s;es, com|mand &s;ome &s;hare with England and France in &s;upplying the re&s;t of Germany. One method of facilitating the operations of trade the Elector has advantageou&s;ly adopted here; that of in&s;tituting a court upon the &s;pot for the deci&s;ion of all cau&s;es, in which the traders are intere&s;ted; and at his expence a navigable canal has been formed from the town to the Rhine. Arti&s;ts and merchants have al&s;o &s;ome privileges, at Franckenthal, of which that of being exempt from the military pre&s;s is not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>This pre&s;s, or levy, is the method, by which all the German Princes return their contingents to the army of the Empire. The population of every town and di&s;trict in their dominions is known with &s;ufficient accuracy, and a &s;ettled number of recruits is &s;upplied by each. When the&s;e are wanted, notice is given, that the men of a certain age mu&s;t a&s;&s;emble and ca&s;t lots for the &s;ervice. Tho&s;e, who are drawn, may find &s;ub&s;titutes, but with this condition, that the de|puty mu&s;t be at lea&s;t as tall as his principal; a regulation, which makes the price of &s;ub&s;titutes depend upon their height, and fre|quently renders it impo&s;&s;ible for the principals to avail them&s;elves of the permi&s;&s;ion. A farmer in this neighbourhood, who was con&s;ider|ably above &s;ix feet in height, could not obtain a &s;ub&s;titute for le&s;s than a hundred louis d'ors.</P>
<P>Another unplea&s;ant condition is attached to this exchange: if the &s;ub&s;titute is di&s;abled, or de&s;erts, another mu&s;t be &s;upplied; and, if he

carries his arms, or accoutrements, away, the&s;e mu&s;t be paid for by the per&s;on, who &s;ent him.</P>

<HEAD>OGGERSHEIM,</HEAD>
<P>A SMALL town, on the we&s;t bank of the Rhine, rebuilt in uniform &s;treets, like Franckenthal, having been de&s;troyed by the &s;ame exertion of Louis the Fourteenth's cruelty. Here al&s;o the modern French had very lately been, and &s;ome of the ruins, left near the road by Louis, appeared to have &s;erved them for kitchens in their excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the ea&s;t end of the town, towards the Rhine, &s;tands a chateau of the Elector, built with modern, but not very admirable ta&s;te, and commanding the di&s;tant river in &s;everal fine points of view. We could not be admitted to &s;ee the in&s;ide, which is &s;aid to have been &s;plendid|ly decorated; for the French had ju&s;t di&s;mantled it of the furniture.</P>
<P>The road from hence to Manheim was bordered for its whole length, of at lea&s;t two miles, by rows of poplars, of which &s;ome &s;till remain near Ogger&s;heim; but tho&s;e within a mile and a half of Man|heim, have been felled at one or two feet from the ground. This was done in December 1793, when the French began to advance from Landau, and were expected to be&s;iege Manheim, their opera|tions

<P>Near the Rhine, the road is now commanded by two forts, of which one was thrown up during the approach of the French, and completed in the middle of the &s;ummer, with great care. The&s;e con|tribute much to the pre&s;ent &s;ecurity of the city, which might other|wi&s;e be bombarded from the oppo&s;ite bank of the river, even by an enemy, who &s;hould not be able and &s;hould not propo&s;e to attempt the conque&s;t of the place. They are ditched and palli&s;adoed, but, being divided from the body of the city, by the Rhine, are, of cour&s;e, without the communication, which renders &s;uch works capable of a long defence. Round one of the&s;e forts, the road now winds, entering a part of the works, near the bridge, where there is a guardhou&s;e for the troops of the Elector.</P>

<HEAD>MANHEIM.</HEAD>
<P>IT was twilight, when we approached Manheim; and the palace, the numerous turrets and the forti&s;ications had their gran|deur probably increa&s;ed by the ob&s;curity. The bridge of boats is not &s;o long as that at Mentz; but we had time enough in pa&s;&s;ing it to ob&s;erve the extent of the city, on the left of which the Neckar pours it&s;elf into the Rhine, &s;o that two &s;ides are entirely wa&s;hed by their &s;treams. At the next guard-hou&s;e, where we were detained by the
<PB N="248" REF="256">
u&s;ual enquiries, the troops were more numerous; and &s;urely no mili|tary figures ever accorded &s;o well with the gloomy gates, and walls they guarded. The uniform of the Palatine light troops is a clo&s;e jacket of motley brown, and pantaloons of the &s;ame that reach to their half-boots. They have black helmets, with cre&s;ts and fronts of bra&s;s, large whi&s;kers, and their faces, by con&s;tant expo&s;ure to the &s;un, are of the deepe&s;t brown that can be, without approaching to black. As they &s;tood &s;ingly on the ramparts, or in groups at the gates, their bronze faces and Roman helmets &s;eemed of a deeper hue, than the gloom, that partly concealed their figures.</P>
<P>The entrance into Manheim, from the Rhine, is by a &s;pacious &s;treet, which leads directly into the centre of the city, and to a large &s;quare, planted with limes, con&s;i&s;ting, on one &s;ide, of public build|ings, and, on the other, of &s;everal noble hou&s;es, one of which is the chief inn, called the <HI>Cour Palatine.</HI> This is the fir&s;t city in Ger|many, that can an&s;wer, by its appearance, the expectations of a foreigner, who has formed them from books. Its a&s;pect is truly that of a capital and of the re&s;idence of a Court; except that in the day|time a traveller may be &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at the fewne&s;s of pa&s;&s;en|gers and the &s;mall &s;hew of traffic, amid&s;t &s;uch public buildings, and in &s;treets of &s;uch convenience and extent. The fairne&s;s, the grandeur and the &s;tateline&s;s, which he may have &s;een attributed to other Ger|man cities, till he is as much di&s;gu&s;ted as deceived by every idea de|rived from de&s;cription, may be perceived in &s;everal parts of Man|heim, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition in all.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="257">
Nor is the beauty of the pre&s;ent city &s;olely owing to the de&s;truction of the antient one by Louis the Fourteenth, in 1689, the year of gene|ral deva&s;tation in the Palatinate. It was laid out in right lines, though to a le&s;s extent, in the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, when Frederic the Fifth laid the foundation of the fortifications, behind which a town was built, that adopted the antient name of Manheim, from a neighbouring one then in decay. The&s;e were the fortifica|tions and the town de&s;troyed by the French in 1689. The plan of both was but extended, when the pre&s;ent works were formed upon the &s;y&s;tem of Cohorn, and the city by degrees re&s;tored, with &s;treets, which, inter&s;ecting each other at right angles, divide it into an hun|dred and &s;even &s;quare portions. The number of the inhabitants, exclu&s;ive of the garri&s;on, was, in 1784, 21,858.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;treets are planted with rows of trees, and there are five or &s;ix open places, &s;uitable for promenades, or markets. The cu&s;tomhou&s;e, which forms a &s;ide to one of the&s;e, is a noble &s;tone building, rather appearing to be a palace, than an office, except that under the colonnades, which &s;urround it, are &s;hops for jewellery and other commodities.</P>
<P>The Electoral palace, which opens, on one &s;ide, to the city, and, on the other, to the ramparts, was built by the Elector Charles-Phi|lippe, who, in the year 1721, removed his re&s;idence hither from Heidelberg, on account of &s;ome difference with the magi&s;trates, or, as is &s;aid, of the prevalence of religious di&s;putes in that city. He began to erect it in 1720; but the edi&s;ice was not completed, till the
<PB N="250" REF="258">
right wing was added by the pre&s;ent Elector, not to be u&s;ed as a re&s;i|dence, but to contain a gallery of paintings, cabinets of antiquities and natural hi&s;tory, a library, trea&s;ury and <HI>manege.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed a morning in viewing the apartments in the other wing, all the paint|ings and books having been removed from this, as well as great part of the furniture from the whole palace, in the dread of an approach|ing bombardment. The per&s;on, who &s;hewed them, took care to keep the credit of each room &s;afe, by a&s;&s;uring us at the door, that it was not in its u&s;ual condition. The Elector had been, for &s;ome months, at Munich, but the Duke and Duche&s;s of Deux Ponts and their family have re&s;ided in this palace, &s;ince their retirement from Deux Ponts, in the latter end of the campaign of 1792.</P>
<P>The rooms are all lofty, and floored with inlaid work of oak and che&s;nut; the ceilings, for the mo&s;t part, painted; and the walls covered with tape&s;try, finely wrought, both as to colour and de&s;ign. Some of this came from a manufactory, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Elector, at Franckenthal.</P>
<P>The furniture, left in &s;everal of the rooms, was grand and antient, but could never have been &s;o co&s;tly as tho&s;e, who have &s;een the man|&s;ions of wealthy individuals in England, would expect to find in a palace. The Elector's &s;tate-bed was inclo&s;ed not only by a railing, but by a gla&s;s ca&s;e to the height of the ceiling, with windows, that could be opened at plea&s;ure, to permit a conver&s;ation with his cour|tiers, when compliments were paid literally at a levee. In the court of France, this practice continued even to very late years, and there
<PB N="251" REF="259">
were three di&s;tinct privileges of entr&eacute;e, denoting the time, at which per&s;ons of different cla&s;&s;es were permitted to enter the chamber. In the Earl of Portland's emba&s;&s;y for King William to Louis the Four|teenth, it was thought a &s;ignal mark of honour, that he was admitted to his audience, not only in the chamber, but within the rails; and there the French Monarch &s;tood with the three young Princes, his grand&s;ons, the Count de Tholou&s;e, the Duke d'Aumont and the Ma|re&s;chal de Noailles. The Duke made his &s;peech covered, after which the King entered into conver&s;ation with him, for &s;everal minutes.</P>
<P>One room, at Manheim, was called the Silver Chamber, from the quantity of &s;olid &s;ilver, u&s;ed about the furniture. Such articles as could be carried away entire, had been removed, but the walls were disfigured by the lo&s;s of the ornaments torn from them, on account of their value. In &s;everal rooms, the furniture, that remained, was partly packed, to be carried away upon the next alarm. The con|tents of the wardrobe were in this &s;tate, and the interior of the&s;e now de&s;olated apartments &s;eemed like the &s;keleton of grandeur. The beauty of the painted ceilings, however, the richne&s;s of the va|rious pro&s;pects, commanded by the windows, and the great extent of the building &s;ufficiently accounted for the reputation, which this palace has, of being the fine&s;t in Germany.</P>
<P>It is built of &s;tone, which has &s;omewhat the reddi&s;h hue of that u&s;ed at Mentz, and, though &s;everal parts are po&s;itively di&s;approved by per&s;ons of &s;kill in architecture, the whole is certainly a grand and &s;umptuous building.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="260">
The &s;ituation of Manheim and the &s;cenery around it are viewed to great advantage from the tower of the Ob&s;ervatory, in which &s;trangers are politely received by the Profe&s;&s;or of A&s;tronomy, who&s;e re&s;idence is e&s;tabli&s;hed in it. From this are &s;een the fruitful plains of the Palatinate, &s;preading, on all &s;ides, to bold mountains, of which tho&s;e of Lorrain, that extend on the we&s;t, lo&s;e in di&s;tance the variety of their colouring, and, a&s;&s;uming a blue tint, retain only the dignity of their form. Among the&s;e, the va&s;t and round headland, called the <HI>Tonne&s;berg,</HI> which is in &s;ight, during the greate&s;t part of the journey from Mentz to Manheim, is pre-eminent.</P>
<P>But the chain, that binds the horizon on the ea&s;t, and is known by the name of the <HI>Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e,</HI> or road of mountains, is near enough to di&s;play all their wild irregularity of &s;hape, the fore&s;t glens, to which they open, and the various tints of rock and &s;oil, of red and purple, that mingle with the corn and wood on their lower &s;teeps. The&s;e mountains are &s;een in the north from their commencement near Franckfort, and this line is never interrupted from thence &s;outh|ward into Switzerland. The rivals to them, on the &s;outh we&s;t, are the mountains of Al&s;ace, which extend in long per&s;pective, and at a di&s;tance appear to unite with tho&s;e of the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e. Among the numerous towns and villages that throng the Palatinate, the &s;pires of Oppenheim and Worms are di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible to the north; almo&s;t beneath the eye are tho&s;e of Franckenthal, and Ogger&s;heim, and to the &s;outhward Spires &s;hews its many towers.</P>
<P>In the nearer &s;cene the Neckar, after tumbling from among the
<PB N="253" REF="261">
fore&s;ts of the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e, falls into the Rhine, a little below the walls of Manheim; and the gardens of a &s;ummer chateau belonging to the Elector occupy the angle between the two rivers.</P>
<P>The&s;e gardens were now &s;urrendered by the Prince to be the camp of three thou&s;and of his troops, detached from the garri&s;on of the city, which, at this time, con&s;i&s;ted of nearly ten thou&s;and men. In &s;everal places, on the banks of the two rivers, batteries were thrown up, and, near the camp, a regular fort, for the purpo&s;e of commanding both; &s;o that Manheim, by its natural and artificial means of defence, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be rendered nearly una&s;&s;ailable, on two &s;ides. On that of Heidelberg, it was not &s;o &s;ecure; nor could the others be defended by a garri&s;on of le&s;s than 15,000 men. It was on this account, that the Elector detained ten thou&s;and of his troops from actual &s;ervice, contrary, as is &s;aid, to the remon|&s;trances of the Emperor, who offered, but without &s;ucce&s;s, to garri|&s;on his capital with Au&s;trians. From the ob&s;ervatory, the camp and the works were ea&s;ily &s;een, and, by the help of a Dollond tele|&s;cope, the only optical in&s;trument remaining, the order of both was &s;o exactly pointed out by our guide, that it was not difficult to com|prehend the u&s;es of them. Military preparations, indeed, occurred very frequently in Manheim. In the gardens of the chief Electoral palace, extending to the ramparts over the Rhine, cannon were planted, which were as regularly guarded by &s;entinels as in the other parts of the fortifications.</P>
<P>All the gates of Manheim appear to be defended by fortifications
<PB N="254" REF="262">
of unu&s;ual &s;trength. Be&s;ides two broad ditches, there are batteries, which play directly upon the bridges, and might de&s;troy them in a few minutes. The gates are guarded, with the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s, and no per&s;on is &s;uffered to enter them, after ten at night, without the expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of the governor. When a courier arrives, who wi&s;hes to u&s;e his privilege of pa&s;&s;ing, at all hours, he puts &s;ome token of his office into a &s;mall tin box, which is kept on the out&s;ide of the ditch, to be drawn acro&s;s it by a cord, that runs upon a roller on each bank. The officer of the guard carries this to the governor, and obtains the keys; but &s;o much time is pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;ort of appli|cation, that couriers, when the nights are &s;hort, u&s;ually wait the opening of the gates, which is &s;oon after day-light, in &s;ummer, and at &s;ix, or &s;even, in winter.</P>
<P>The ab&s;ence of the Elector, we were a&s;&s;ured, had much altered the appearance of Manheim, where &s;carcely a carriage was now to be &s;een, though there were traces enough of the gaiety and general &s;plendour of this little Court. Here are an Opera Hou&s;e, a German Comedy, an Amateur Concert, an Electoral Lottery, an Academy of Sculpture and De&s;ign, and an Academy of Sciences. The Opera performances are held in a wing of the palace, and were e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1742, but have not attained much celebrity, being &s;upported chiefly by performers from the other Theatre. This la&s;t is called a national e&s;tabli&s;hment, the players being Germans, and the Thea|tre founded in 1779 at the expence of the Elector. The Baron de Dahlberg, one of his Mini&s;ters, has the &s;uperintendance of it.
<PB N="255" REF="263">
The Amateur Concert is held, every Friday, during the winter, and is much frequented.</P>
<P>The Electoral Lotteries, for there are two, are drawn in the pre|&s;ence of the Mini&s;ter of Finances, and one of them is le&s;s di&s;advan|tageous for the game&s;ters than is u&s;ual with &s;uch undertakings. That, which con&s;i&s;ts of chances determined in the cu&s;tomary way, gives the Elector an advantage of only five to four over the &s;ub&s;cribers. The other, which is formed upon the more intricate model of that of Ge|noa, entitles the &s;ub&s;cribers to prizes, proportioned to the number of times a certain ticket i&s;&s;ues from the wheel, five numbers being drawn out of ninety, or rather five drawings of one number each being &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively made out of ninety tickets. A ticket, which i&s;&s;ues once in the&s;e five drawings, wins fifteen times the value of the &s;take; one, that &s;hould be drawn each of the five times, would entitle the owner to have his original &s;take multiplied by &s;ixty thou&s;and, and the product would be his prize. The undertaker of this latter Lottery has the chances immen&s;ely in his favour.</P>
<P>From the very large income, to which the&s;e Lotteries contribute a part, the pre&s;ent Elector has certainly made con&s;iderable di&s;bur&s;e|ments, with u&s;eful purpo&s;es, if not to u&s;eful effects. Of his founda|tion are the Academy of Sciences, which was opened in 1763, for weekly &s;ittings, and has proceeded to &s;ome corre&s;pondence with other Academies; the German Society, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the ea&s;y pur|po&s;e of purifying and the difficult one of fixing language; the Ca|binet of Phy&s;ics, or rather of experimental philo&s;ophy, celebrated
<PB N="256" REF="264">
for the variety and magnitude of its in&s;truments, among which are two burning gla&s;&s;es of three feet diameter, &s;aid to be capable of lique|fying bodies, even bottles filled with water, at 10 feet di&s;tance; the Ob&s;ervatory, of 108 feet high, in which all the chief in&s;truments were Engli&s;h; a Botanical Garden and Director&s;hip; an Academy of Sculpture, and a Cabinet of Engravings and Drawings, formed un|der the direction of M. Krahe of Du&s;&s;eldorff, in 400 folio volumes.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, none of the ornaments, or materials, that were portable, now remain at Manheim. The a&s;tronomical in|&s;truments, the celebrated collection of &s;tatues, the paintings and the prints have been removed, together with the Electoral trea&s;ure of diamonds and jewels, &s;ome to Munich and &s;ome to other places of &s;ecurity. But, though we mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ight, which even its rarity would have rendered welcome, it &s;eems proper, after &s;uch frequent notice of the barrenne&s;s of Germany, to mention what has been collected in one of its chief cities.</P>
<P>The expectation of an attack had di&s;mantled other hou&s;es, be&s;ides the Elector's, of their furniture; for, in the Cour Palatine, a very &s;pacious, and really a good inn, not a curtain and &s;carcely a &s;poon was left. <HI>A cau&s;e de la guerre</HI> was, indeed, the general excu&s;e for every deficiency, u&s;ed by tho&s;e, who had civility enough to offer one; but, in truth, the war had not often incroached upon the ordi|nary &s;tock of conveniencies in Germany, which was previou&s;ly too low to be capable of much reduction. The places, which the French had actually entered, are, of cour&s;e, to be excepted; but
<PB N="257" REF="265">
it may otherwi&s;e be believed, that Germany can lo&s;e little by a war, more than the unfortunate labourers, whom it forces to become &s;oldiers. The lo&s;s of wealth mu&s;t come chiefly from other countries. A rich nation may give pre&s;ent trea&s;ure; a commercial nation may give both pre&s;ent trea&s;ure and the means of future competence.</P>
<P>The land near Manheim is chiefly planted with tobacco and mad|der, and the land&s;cape is enlivened with &s;mall, but neat country|hou&s;es, &s;cattered along the margin of the Neckar. The neighbour|hood abounds in plea&s;ant rides, and, whether you wind the high banks of the maje&s;tic Rhine, or the borders of the more tranquil Neckar, the mountains of the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e, tumbled upon each other in wild confu&s;ion, generally form the magnificent back ground of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>On returning from an excur&s;ion of this kind at the clo&s;e of even|ing, the &s;oldiers at the gates are frequently heard chanting martial &s;ongs in parts and chorus; a fonorous mu&s;ic in &s;evere uni&s;on with the &s;olemnity of the hour and the imperfect forms, that meet the eye, of &s;entinels keeping watch beneath the du&s;ky gateways, while their brethren, repo&s;ing on the benches without, mingle their voices in the deep chorus. Rude and &s;imple as are the&s;e &s;trains, they are often &s;ingularly impre&s;&s;ive, and touch the imagination with &s;ome|thing approaching to horror, when the circum&s;tances of the place are remembered, and it is con&s;idered how &s;oon the&s;e men, &s;ent to in|flict death on others, may them&s;elves be thrown into the unnum|bered heap of the military &s;lain.</P>

<HEAD>SCHWEZINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>AN excellent road, &s;heltered for nine Engli&s;h miles by rows of high poplars, conducted us through richly cultivated plains from Manheim to Schwezingen, a &s;mall village, di&s;tingui&s;hed by an Electoral chateau and gardens. This was one of the plea&s;ante&s;t rides we had found in Germany, for the road, though it exhibited little of either the wild or picture&s;que, frequently opened towards the mountains, bright with a variety of colouring, and then again was &s;hrouded among woods and plantations, that bordered the neigh|bouring fields, and brought faintly to remembrance the &s;tyle and mingled verdure of our native land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Schwezingen had been very lately the Au&s;trian head-quarters, for the army of the Upper Rhine, and &s;ome &s;oldiers were &s;till &s;tationed near the road to guard an immen&s;e magazine of wood; but there were otherwi&s;e no military &s;ymptoms about the place.</P>
<P>The chateau is an old and inelegant building, not large enough to have been ever u&s;ed as a formal re&s;idence. The pre&s;ent Elector has added to it two wings, each of &s;ix hundred feet long, but &s;o low, that the apartments are all on the ground floor. Somewhat of that air of neglect, which can &s;adden even the mo&s;t delightful &s;cenes, is vi&s;ible here; &s;everal of the windows are broken, and the theatre,
<PB N="259" REF="267">
mu&s;ic-room, and ball-room, which have been laid out in one of the wings, are abandoned to du&s;t and lumber.</P>
<P>The gardens, however, are pre&s;erved in better order. Before the palace, a long vi&s;ta of lawn and wood, with numerous and &s;pacious fountains, guarded by &s;tatues, di&s;play &s;omething of the old French manner; other parts &s;hew charming &s;cenery, and deep &s;ylvan rece&s;|&s;es, where nature is again at liberty; in a bay formed by the woods is an amphitheatre of fragrant orange trees, placed in front of a light &s;emicircular green-hou&s;e, and crowned with lofty groves. Near this delicious &s;pot, extends a bending arcade of lattice-work, interwoven with vines and many beautifully flowering plants; a &s;ort of &s;tructure, the filagree lightne&s;s of which it is impo&s;&s;ible not to admire, again&s;t precept, and perhaps, when general effect is con&s;idered, again&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary ta&s;te. In another part, &s;heltered by the woods, is an edifice in the &s;tyle of a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, with its light cloi&s;tered courts, &s;lender minarets, and painted entrances, in&s;cribed with Arabic mot|tos, which by the German tran&s;lations appear to expre&s;s the plea&s;ure of friendly conver&s;ation and of indolence in &s;ummer. The gardens have this re&s;ult of a judicious arrangement, that they &s;eem to extend much beyond their real limits, which we di&s;covered only by a&s;cend|ing one of the minarets. They are open to the public, during great part of every day, under certain rules for their pre&s;ervation, of which copies are pa&s;ted up in &s;everal places.</P>

<HEAD>CARLSRUHE.</HEAD>
<P>AT Schwezingen the fine Electoral road concludes, and we began to wind along the &s;kirts of a fore&s;t on the left, having on the right an open corn country, beyond which appeared the towers of Spires and Philip&s;burg, of which the former was then the head|quarters of the Au&s;trian army, and the latter is memorable for having given birth to Melancthon in 1491. Waghau&s;el and Bruch|&s;al are &s;mall po&s;ting places in this route, at a village between which we had another in&s;tance of the little attention paid to travellers in Germany. At a &s;mall inn, noxious with &s;ome fumigation u&s;ed again&s;t bugs, we were detained a quarter of an hour, becau&s;e the landlord, who had gone out after our arrival, had not left word how much we &s;hould pay, and the poor old woman, who, without &s;hoes or &s;tockings, attended us, was terrified when we talked of leaving what was proper, and proceeding before his return.</P>
<P>About a mile beyond Bruch&s;al our po&s;tillion quitted the chau&s;&s;&eacute;e, and entered a &s;ummer road, through the deep and exten&s;ive fore&s;t of Carl&s;ruhe, pre&s;erved by the Margrave of Baden for the &s;helter of game. Avenues cut through this fore&s;t for nine or ten miles in every direction, converge at his palace and city of Carl&s;ruhe, as at a point. Other cruelties than tho&s;e of the cha&s;e &s;ometimes take place in the&s;e delightful &s;cenes, for an amphitheatre has been formed in
<PB N="261" REF="269">
the woods, where imitations of a Spani&s;h bull fea&s;t have been exhi|bited; to &s;uch horrid means of preventing vacuity of mind has a prince had recour&s;e, who is otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed for the elegance of his ta&s;te, and the &s;uavity of his manners!</P>
<P>The &s;cenery of this fore&s;t is very various. Sometimes we found our way through groves of ancient pine and fir, &s;o thickly planted that their lower branches were withered for want of air, and it &s;eemed as if the carriage could not proceed between them; at others we pa&s;&s;ed under the &s;preading &s;hade of che&s;nuts, oak and walnut, and cro&s;&s;ed many a cool &s;tream, green with the impending foliage, on who&s;e &s;eque&s;tered bank one almo&s;t expected to &s;ee the moralizing Jacques; &s;o exactly did the &s;cene accord with Shake&s;peare's de&s;crip|tion. The woods again opening, we found our&s;elves in a noble avenue, and &s;aw the &s;tag gracefully bounding acro&s;s it <Q REND="inline">"to more profound repo&s;e;"</Q> while now and then a hut, formed of rude green planks under &s;ome old oak, &s;eemed, by its &s;moked &s;ides, to have often afforded a &s;heltered repa&s;t to hunting parties.</P>
<P>Near Carl&s;ruhe the gardens of the Prince and then the palace be|come vi&s;ible, the road winding along them, on the edge of the fo|re&s;t, till it enters the northern gate of the city, the uniformity of which has the &s;ame date as its completion, the ground plot having been entirely laid out between January and June 1715, on the 17th of which month the Margrave Charles William laid the foundation &s;tone.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are accordingly &s;pacious, light, and exactly &s;traight;
<PB N="262" REF="270">
but not &s;o magnificent as tho&s;e of Manheim, and &s;till le&s;s enlivened with pa&s;&s;engers. Since the commencement of the war, the gaieties of the Court, which afforded &s;ome occupation to the inhabitants, have cea&s;ed; the nobility have left their hou&s;es; and the Margrave is contented with the amu&s;ements of his library, in which Engli&s;h literature is &s;aid to fill a con&s;iderable &s;pace.</P>
<P>Carl&s;ruhe has the advantage of not being fortified; &s;o that the inhabitants are not oppre&s;&s;ed by a numerous garri&s;on, and &s;trangers pa&s;s through it, though &s;o near the &s;eat of war, without interrup|tion. It is le&s;s than Manheim by at lea&s;t half, and has no con&s;ider|able public building, except the palace, from the &s;pacious area before which, all the &s;treets proceed as <HI>radii,</HI> till their furthe&s;t ends fill up the figure of a &s;emicircle. The hou&s;es in the area, which immediately front the palace, are built over a piazza interrupted only by the commencement of the &s;treets. The palace has, of cour&s;e, an unexampled advantage in the mixture of town and rural &s;cenery in its pro&s;pects, looking on one &s;ide through all the &s;treets of the city, and on the other through thirty-two fore&s;t alleys, cut to various lengths of from ten to fifteen Engli&s;h miles each; few, however, of the latter pro&s;pects are now commanded except from the upper win|dows, the pre&s;ent Elector having entirely changed the &s;tyle of the intervening gardens, and permitted them to be laid out in the Engli&s;h ta&s;te, without re&s;pect to the thirty-two inter&s;ections, that rendered them conformable with the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed part of two days at Carl&s;ruhe, and were chiefly in the&s;e
<PB N="263" REF="271">
gardens, which are of the mo&s;t enchanting beauty and richne&s;s. The warmth of the climate draws up colours for the &s;hrubs and plants, which we thought could not be equalled in more northern latitudes; two thou&s;and and &s;even hundred orange and lemon trees, loaded with fruit and blo&s;&s;oms, perfumed the air; and choice &s;hrubs, marked with the Linnean di&s;tinctions, compo&s;ed the thickets. The gardens, being limited only by the fore&s;ts, appear to unite with them; and the deep verdure and luxuriance of the latter are contra&s;ted &s;weetly with the tender green of the lawns and plants, and with the variety of &s;carce and maje&s;tic trees, mingled with the garden groves.</P>
<P>The palace is a large and &s;umptuous, though not an elegant edi|&s;ice, built of &s;tone like all the re&s;t of the city, and at the &s;ame period. The Margrave generally re&s;ides in it, and has rendered it a valuable home, by adding greatly to the library, filling an ob&s;ervatory with excellent in&s;truments, and pre&s;erving the whole &s;tructure in a condition not u&s;ual in Germany. The &s;pot, compared with the &s;urrounding country, appeared like Milton's Eden&mdash;like Paradi&s;e opened in the wild.</P>
<P>Beyond Carl&s;ruhe the road begins to approach the Rhine, which we had lo&s;t &s;ight of near Manheim; and, though the river is never within view, the country is con&s;idered as a military frontier, being con&s;tantly patrolled by troops. Some of the&s;e were of the Prince of Cond&eacute;'s army of emigrants, who have no uniform, and are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed only by the white cockade, and by a bandage of white linen,
<PB N="264" REF="272">
impre&s;&s;ed with black <HI>fleurs de lis,</HI> upon the right arm. They were chiefly on foot, and then wore only their &s;words, without fire|arms.</P>
<P>Near the road, a &s;mall party of Au&s;trians were guarding a maga|zine, before a tent, marked, like their regimentals, with green upon white. Soon afterwards, our po&s;tillion drew up on one &s;ide, to permit a train of carriages to pa&s;s, and immediately announced the <HI>Prinz von Cond&eacute;,</HI> who was in an open landau, followed by two covered waggons for his kitchen and laundry, and by a coach with attendants.</P>
<P>He appeared to be between fifty and &s;ixty; tall, not corpulent, and of an air, which might have announced the French courtier, if his rank had been unknown. A &s;tar was embroidered upon his military &s;urtout, but he had no guards, though travelling within the juri&s;diction allotted to him as a general officer. So little was the road frequented at this period, that his was the &s;econd or third car|riage we had met, except military waggons, &s;ince leaving Mentz; a di&s;tance of more than eighty Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>The road for the whole &s;tage between Carl&s;ruhe and Ra&s;tadt, about fifteen miles, is planted, as &s;eems cu&s;tomary in Germany between the palaces of &s;overeigns, with lofty trees, of which the &s;hade was extremely refre&s;hing at this &s;ea&s;on; the clouds of &s;and, that ro&s;e from the road, would otherwi&s;e have made the heat intole|rable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t hou&s;e in Ra&s;tadt is the palace of the Margrave of Baden
<PB N="265" REF="273">
Baden, brother of the Margrave of Baden Durlach, who&s;e re&s;idence is at Carl&s;ruhe, a &s;mall and heavy building, that fronts the avenue, and is &s;urrounded with &s;tone walls. The interior is &s;aid to be &s;plen|didly decorated, and a chamber is pre&s;erved in the &s;tate, in which Prince Eugene and Mar&s;hal Villars left it in 1714, after concluding the peace between the Emperor and Louis the Fourteenth. The Prince of Baden, being then a general in the &s;ervice of the Emperor, had not been able to e&s;cape the vengeance of Louis, who&s;e troops in 1688 fir&s;t plundered, and then burnt, the palace and city, and in the war of the Succe&s;&s;ion they had a camp on the adjoining plain. The Prince is therefore &s;uppo&s;ed to have lent the palace, which he had rebuilt, with the more readine&s;s, that the Mar&s;hal might &s;ee how perfectly he could overcome his lo&s;s. The plunder of the city in 1688 had continued for five days, and it is mentioned in its hi&s;tory that the French carried away fifteen waggon loads of wine of the vintage of 1572.</P>
<P>Ra&s;tadt, like Carl&s;ruhe, is built upon one plan, but is as inferior to it in beauty, as in &s;ize. The chief &s;treet is, however, uncom|monly broad, &s;o much &s;o, that the upper end is u&s;ed as a market|place, and the &s;tatue of the founder, Prince Louis, in the centre, is &s;een with all the advantages of &s;pace and per&s;pective. There is, not|with&s;tanding, little appearance of traffic, and the inhabitants &s;eemed to be much le&s;s numerous than the emigrant corps, which was then &s;tationed there, the head quarters of the Prince of Cond&eacute; being e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the city. We pa&s;&s;ed an hour at an inn, which was nearly
<PB N="266" REF="274">
filled by part of this corps, and were compelled to witne&s;s the di&s;|tre&s;s and di&s;appointment, excited by intelligence ju&s;t then received of the &s;tate of affairs in the Low Countries.</P>
<P>A &s;mall park of artillery was kept on the &s;outhern &s;ide of Ra&s;tadt, where there is a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge over the river Murg, that falls into the Rhine, at the di&s;tance of a league from the city. Soon after, the road pa&s;&s;es by the groves of the <HI>Favorita,</HI> a &s;ummer palace built by a dowager Margravine. We now drew nearer to the mountains of the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e, which had di&s;appeared near Schwezingen, and had ri&s;en again partially through the morn|ing mi&s;ts, &s;oon after our quitting Carl&s;ruhe. They are here of more awful height, and abrupt &s;teepne&s;s than in the neighbourhood of Manheim, and, on their pointed brows, are frequently the ruins of ca&s;tles, placed &s;ometimes where it &s;eems as if no human foot could climb. The nearer we approached the&s;e mountains the more we had occa&s;ion to admire the various tints of their granites. Sometimes the precipices were of a faint pink, then of a deep red, a dull purple, or a blu&s;h approaching to lilac, and &s;ometimes gleams of a pale yel|low mingled with the low &s;hrubs, that grew upon their &s;ides. The day was cloudle&s;s and bright, and we were too near the&s;e heights to be deceived by the illu&s;ions of aerial colouring; the real hues of their features were as beautiful, as their magnitude was &s;ublime. The plains, that extend along their feet to the Rhine, are richly cultivated with corn, and, beyond the river, others, which appear to be equally fruitful, &s;pread towards the mountains of Al&s;ace,
<PB N="267" REF="275">
a corre&s;ponding chain with the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e, va&s;t and now blue with di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The manners of the people from Manheim downwards, are more civilized than in the upper parts of Germany; an improvement, which may with great probability be imputed to the &s;uperior fruitfulne&s;s of the country, that amends their condition, and with it the &s;ocial qualities. The farms are more numerous, the labourers le&s;s dejected, and the women, who &s;till work barefooted in the fields, have &s;ome|what of a ruddy brown in their complexion, in&s;tead of the &s;allow|ne&s;s, that renders the ferocious, or &s;ullen air of the others more &s;trik|ing. They are al&s;o better dre&s;&s;ed; for, though they retain the &s;louched woollen hat, they have caps; and towards the borders of Switzerland their appearance becomes picture&s;que. Here they frequently wear a blue petticoat with a cherry-coloured boddice, full white &s;leeves fa&s;tened above the elbow, and a mu&s;lin handkerchief thrown grace|fully round the neck in a &s;ort of roll; the hair &s;ometimes platted round the head, and held on the crown with a large bodkin. On holidays, the girls have often a flat &s;traw hat, with bows of ribband hanging behind. Higher up, the women wear their long black hair platted, but falling in a queue down the back.</P>
<P>The cottages are al&s;o &s;omewhat better, and the &s;ides entirely covered with vines, on which, in the beginning of July, were grapes bigger than capers, and in immen&s;e quantities. Sometimes Turkey corn is put to dry under the projections of the fir&s;t floor, and the gardens are ornamented with a &s;hort alley of hops. Meat is

<PB N="268" REF="276">
however bad and &s;carce; the appearance &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting before it is dre&s;&s;ed, that tho&s;e, who can accommodate their palates to the cook|ing, mu&s;t endeavour to forget what they have &s;een. Butter is &s;till more &s;carce, and the little chee&s;e that appears, is only a new white curd, made up in rolls, &s;carcely bigger than an egg. A &s;ort of beer is here made for &s;ervants, the ta&s;te of which affords no &s;ymptom of either malt or hops; it is often nearly white, and appears to have been brewed but a few hours; what is &s;omewhat browner is bottled, and &s;old at about three-pence a quart.</P>
<P>Our road, this day, was feldom more than two leagues di&s;tant from the Rhine, and we expected to have heard the fire, which the Au&s;trian and French po&s;ts, who have their batteries on the two banks of the river, frequently exchange with each other. The tran|quillity was, however, as &s;ound as in any other country, and nothing but the continuance of patroles and convoys reminded us of our nearne&s;s to the war. The pea&s;ants were as lei&s;urely cutting their harve&s;t, and all the other bu&s;ine&s;s of rural life was proceeding as uninterruptedly, as if there was no po&s;&s;ibility of an attack. Yet we afterwards learned, that the French had, very early on the morning of this day, ineffectually attempted the pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine, about fifteen miles higher up; and the firing had been di&s;tinctly heard at a little village where we dined.</P>
<P>One road, as &s;hort as this, lies immediately upon the margin of the river; and, as we were a&s;&s;ured that none but military parties were fired at, we wi&s;hed to pa&s;s it, for the purpo&s;e of ob&s;erving the inge|nious
<PB N="269" REF="277">
methods, by which a country &s;o circum&s;tanced is defended; but our po&s;tillion, who dreaded, that he might be pre&s;&s;ed by the Au&s;trians, for the intru&s;ion, refu&s;ed to venture upon it, and, in&s;tead of proceeding to Kehl, which is directly oppo&s;ite to Stra&s;bourg, we took the road for Offenburg, about three leagues from the Rhine.</P>
<P>The country through which our route now lay, better as it is than more northern parts, has &s;uffered &s;ome po&s;itive injuries by the war. Before this, all the little towns, from Carl&s;ruhe downwards, main|tained &s;ome commerce with France, on their own account, and &s;up|plied carriage for that of others. In return for provi&s;ions and coar&s;e commodities for manufacture, carried to Stra&s;bourg, they received the &s;ilks and woollens of France, to be di&s;per&s;ed at Franckfort, or Manheim. The intercour&s;e between the two countries was &s;o fre|quent, that nearly all the trade&s;men, and many of the labouring per|&s;ons in this part of Germany &s;peak a little French. The landlord of the hou&s;e, where we dined, a&s;&s;ured us that, though his village was &s;o &s;mall, he had &s;ufficient bu&s;ine&s;s before the war; now he was upon the point of removing to Offenburg, being unable to pay his rent, during the interruption of travelling.</P>
<P>A little before &s;un-&s;et, we came to Appenweyer, one of the&s;e towns, from the entrance of which the &s;pires of Stra&s;bourg were &s;o plainly vi&s;ible that we could &s;ee the fanes glittering again&s;t the light, and even the forms of the fortifications near the water could be traced. In the mid&s;t of the &s;traggling town of Appenweyer the loud &s;ounds of martial mu&s;ic and then the appearance of troops, entering

<PB N="270" REF="278">
at the oppo&s;ite end, &s;urpri&s;ed us. This was the advanced guard of &s;everal Au&s;trian regiments, on their march to re-inforce the allied army in the Low Countries. Our po&s;tillion had drawn up, to &s;ur|render as much of the road as po&s;&s;ible to them, but their march was &s;o irregular, that they frequently thronged round the carriage; affording us &s;ufficient opportunity to ob&s;erve how far their air corre&s;ponded with what has been &s;o often &s;aid of the Au&s;trian &s;oldiery.</P>
<P>Except as to their dre&s;s and arms, their appearance is not military, according to any notion, which an Engli&s;hman is likely to have formed; that is, there is nothing of activity, nothing of &s;pirit, of cheerfulne&s;s, of the correctne&s;s of di&s;cipline, or of the eagerne&s;s of the youthful in it. There is much of ferocity, much of timid cruelty, of &s;ullenne&s;s, indolence and awkwardne&s;s. They dre&s;s up their faces with mu&s;tachios, and &s;eem extremely de&s;irous to impre&s;s terror. How far this may be effectual again&s;t other troops we cannot know; but they certainly are, by their ferocious manners, and by the traits, which a nearer view of them di&s;clo&s;es, very terrible to the peaceful traveller. Though now immediately under the eyes of their officers they could &s;carcely refrain from petty in&s;ults, and from wi&s;hfully laying their hands upon our baggage.</P>
<P>About a thou&s;and men pa&s;&s;ed in two divi&s;ions, which had com|menced their march a few hours before, for the purpo&s;e of avoid|ing the heat of the day. As we proceeded, the trodden corn in the &s;ields &s;hewed where they had re&s;ted.</P>
<P>It was night before we reached Offenburg, where we were com|pelled
<PB N="271" REF="279">
to lodge at a wretched inn called the Po&s;t-hou&s;e, the ma&s;ter of the other having that day removed to admit a new tenant; but the condition of the lodging was of little importance, for, all night, the heavy trampling of feet along the road below prevented &s;leep, and with the fir&s;t dawn the &s;ound of martial mu&s;ic drew us to the win|dows. It &s;eemed like a dream, when the Au&s;trian bands played <HI>&ccedil;a ira,</HI> with double drums, and cymbals thrown almo&s;t up to our ca&s;ements, louder than any we had ever heard before. This was the main body of the army, of which we had met the advanced party. Each regiment was followed by a long train of baggage carriages, of various and curious de&s;criptions, &s;ome of the cabriolets having a woman nearly in man's apparel in the front, and behind, a large ba&s;ket higher than the carriage, filled with hay. This <Q REND="inline">"tide of human exi&s;tence"</Q> continued to pa&s;s for &s;everal hours. But the whole army did not con&s;i&s;t of more than three regiments of infantry, among which were tho&s;e of D'Arcy, and Pellegrini, and one of hor&s;e; for each of the Au&s;trian regiments of foot contains, when complete, two thou&s;and three hundred men. They had with them a &s;mall train of artillery, and were to proceed to the Low Countries as quick as they could march; but, &s;o uniform are the expedients of the councils of Vienna, that the opportunity of carrying the&s;e troops down the Rhine in barges from Phillip&s;burg, where it was prac|ticable, was not adopted, though this method would have &s;aved two weeks out of three, and have landed the army unfatigued at its po&s;t.</P>

All their regimentals were white, faced either with light blue, or pompadour, and &s;eemed un&s;uitably delicate for figures &s;o large and heavy. The cavalry were loaded with many articles of baggage, but their hor&s;es appeared to be of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erviceable kind. This was a grand military &s;how, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee without many reflections on human nature and human mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Offenburg is a &s;mall town, in the Margraviate of Baden Baden, plea&s;antly &s;eated at the feet of the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e, which the road again approaches &s;o near as to be &s;omewhat ob&s;tructed by its acclivities. Our way lay along the ba&s;e of the&s;e &s;teeps, during the whole day; and as we drew nearer to Switzerland, their height became &s;till more &s;tupendous, and the mountains of Al&s;ace &s;eemed advancing to meet them in the long per&s;pective; the plains between, through which the Rhine gleamed in long &s;weeps, appeared to be entirely covered with corn, and in the nearer &s;cene joyous groups were loading the waggons with the harve&s;t. An harve&s;t of another kind was ripen|ing among the lower rocks of the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e, where the light green of the vines enlivened every cliff, and &s;ometimes over&s;pread the ruinous walls of what had once been fortre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed many villages, &s;haded with noble trees, which had more appearance of comfort than any we had &s;een, and which were enviable for the plea&s;antne&s;s of their &s;ituation; their &s;pacious &s;treet generally opening to the grandeur of the mountain vi&s;ta, that extend|ed to the &s;outh.

<P>It was evening when we came within view of Friburg, the la&s;t city of Germany on the borders of Switzerland, and found our&s;elves among mountains, which partook of the immen&s;ity and &s;ublimity of tho&s;e of that enchanting country. But what was our emotion, when, from an eminence, we di&s;covered the pointed &s;ummits of what we believed to be the Swi&s;s mountains them&s;elves, a multitudi|nous a&s;&s;emblage rolled in the far-di&s;tant pro&s;pect! This glimp&s;e of a country of all others in Europe the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing and grand, awakened a thou&s;and intere&s;ting recollections and delightful expecta|tions; while we watched with regret even this partial vi&s;ion vani&s;h|ing from our eyes as we de&s;cended towards Friburg. The moun|tains, that encompa&s;s this city, have &s;o much the character of the great, that we immediately recollect the line of &s;eparation between Germany and Switzerland to be merely artificial, not marked even by a river. Yet while we yield to the awful plea&s;ure which this eternal va&s;tne&s;s in&s;pires, we feel the in&s;ignificance of our temporary nature, and, &s;eeming more than ever con&s;cious by what a &s;lender &s;y&s;|tem our exi&s;tence is upheld, &s;omewhat of dejection and anxiety min|gle with our admiration.</P>

<HEAD>FRIBURG</HEAD>
<P>IS an ancient Imperial city and the capital of the Bri&s;gau. Its name alludes to the privileges granted to &s;uch cities; but its pre|&s;ent condition, like that of many others, is a proof of the virtual di&s;continuance of the rights, by which the Sovereign intended to in|vite to one part of his dominions the advantages of commerce. Its appearance is that, which we have &s;o often de&s;cribed; better than Cologne, and wor&s;e than Mentz; its &s;ize is about a third part of the latter city. On de&s;cending to it, the fir&s;t di&s;tinct object is the &s;pire of the great church, a remarkable &s;tructure, the &s;tones of which are laid with open inter&s;tices, &s;o that the light appears through its taper|ing &s;ides. Of this &s;ort of &s;tone fillagree work there are &s;aid to be other &s;pecimens in Germany. The city was once &s;trongly fortified, and has endured &s;ome celebrated &s;ieges. In 1677, 1713, and 1745 is was taken by the French, who, in the latter year, de&s;troyed all the fortifications, which had rendered it formidable, and left nothing but the pre&s;ent walls.</P>
<P>Being, however, a frontier place towards Switzerland, it is pro|vided with a &s;mall Au&s;trian garri&s;on; and the bu&s;ine&s;s of permitting, or preventing the pa&s;&s;age of travellers into that country is entru&s;ted to its officers. The malignity, or ignorance of one of the&s;e, called the Lieutenant de Place, prevented us from reaching it, after a jour|ney
<PB N="275" REF="283">
of more than &s;ix hundred miles; a di&s;appointment, which no per&s;on could bear without &s;evere regret, but which was alloyed to us by the reports we daily heard of &s;ome approaching change in Switzerland unfavourable to England, and by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the deduction which, in &s;pite of all endeavours at ab&s;traction, encroach|ments upon phy&s;ical comfort and upon the a&s;&s;urance of peacefulne&s;s make from the di&s;po&s;ition to enquiry, or fancy.</P>
<P>We had delivered at the gate the German pa&s;&s;port, recommended to us by M. de Schwartzkoff, and which had been &s;igned by the Commandant at Mentz; the man, who took it, promi&s;ing to bring it properly atte&s;ted to our inn. He returned without the pa&s;&s;port, and, as we afterwards found, carried our voiturier to be examined by an officer. We endeavoured in vain to obtain an explanation, as to this delay and appearance of &s;u&s;picion, till, at &s;upper, the Lieutenant de Place announced him&s;elf, and pre&s;ently &s;hewed, that he was not come to offer apologies. This man, an illiterate Piedmonte&s;e in the Au&s;trian &s;ervice, either believed, or affected to do &s;o, that our name was not Radcliffe, but &s;omething like it, with a German termina|tion, and that we were not Engli&s;h, but Germans. Neither my Lord Grenville's, or M. de Schwartzkoff's pa&s;&s;ports, our letters from London to families in Switzerland, nor one of credit from the Me&s;&s;rs. Hopes of Am&s;terdam to the Banking-hou&s;e of Porta at Lau&s;anne, all of which he pretended to examine, could remove this di&s;cerning &s;u&s;picion as to our country. While we were con&s;idering, as much as vexation would permit, what circum&s;tance could have afforded a pretext for any part of this intru&s;ion, it came out inci|dentally,
<PB N="276" REF="284">
that the confirmation given to our pa&s;&s;port at Mentz, which we had never examined, expre&s;&s;ed <Q REND="inline">"returning to England,"</Q> though the pa&s;s it&s;elf was for Ba&s;il, to which place we were upon our route.</P>
<P>Such a contradiction might certainly have ju&s;tified &s;ome delay, if we had not been enabled to prove it accidental to the &s;atisfaction of any per&s;on de&s;irous of being right. The pa&s;&s;port had been produced at Mentz, together with tho&s;e of two Engli&s;h arti&s;ts, then on their return from Rome, whom we had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee at Franckfort. The Secretary in&s;cribed all the pa&s;&s;ports alike for England, and M. de Lucadou, the Commandant, ha&s;tily &s;igned ours, without ob&s;erving the mi&s;take, though he &s;o well knew us to be upon the road to Switzer|land, that he politely endeavoured to render us &s;ome &s;ervice there. Our friends in Mentz being known to him, he de&s;ired us to accept an addre&s;s from him&s;elf to M. de Wilde, Intendant of &s;alt mines near Bec. We produced to Mr. Lieutenant this addre&s;s, as a proof, that the Commandant both knew us, and where we were going; but it &s;oon appeared, that, though the former might have hone&s;tly fallen into his &s;u&s;picions at fir&s;t, he had a malignant ob&s;tinacy in refu&s;ing to abandon them. He left us, with notice that we could not quit the town without receiving the Commandant's permi&s;&s;ion by his means; and it was with &s;ome terror, that we perceived our&s;elves to be &s;o much in his power, in a place where there was a pretext for military authority, and where the lea&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of ju&s;t indignation &s;eemed to provoke a di&s;po&s;ition for further inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The only relief, which could be hinted to us, was to write to the Commandant at Mentz, who might re-te&s;tify his knowledge of our
<PB N="277" REF="285">
de&s;tination; yet, as an an&s;wer could not be received in le&s;s than eight days, and, as imagination &s;ugge&s;ted not only all the po&s;&s;ible horrors of oppre&s;&s;ion, during that period, but all the contrivances, by which the malignant di&s;po&s;ition we had already experienced, might even then be prevented from di&s;appointment, we looked upon this re&s;ource as little better than the wor&s;t, and re&s;olved in the morning to demand leave for an immediate return to Mentz.</P>
<P>There being then &s;ome witne&s;&s;es to the application, the Lieutenant conducted him&s;elf with more propriety, and even propo&s;ed an intro|duction to the Commandant, to whom we could not before hear of any direct means of acce&s;s; there being a po&s;&s;ibility, he &s;aid, that a pa&s;&s;age into Switzerland might be permitted. But the di&s;gu&s;t of Au&s;trian authority was now &s;o complete, that we were not di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;k the mockery of an appeal. The Lieutenant expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to allow our pa&s;&s;age, if we &s;hould choo&s;e to return from Mentz with another pa&s;&s;port; but we had no intention to be ever again in his power, and, a&s;&s;uring him that we &s;hould not return, left Friburg without the hope of penetrating through the experienced, and pre&s;ent difficulties of Germany, into the far-&s;een delights of Switzerland.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e, who leave one home for another, think, in the fir&s;t part of their journey, of the friends they have left, and, in the la&s;t, of tho&s;e, to whom they are going; &s;o we, in quitting the borders of Switzerland, thought only of that country; and, when we regained the eminence from whence the tops of its mountains had been &s;o lately viewed with enthu&s;ia&s;tic hope, all this delightful expectation
<PB N="278" REF="286">
occurred again to the mind, only to torture it with the certainty of our lo&s;s; but, as the di&s;tance from Switzerland increa&s;ed, the attrac|tions of home gathered &s;trength, and the inconveniences of Ger|many, which had been &s;o readily felt before, could &s;carcely be no|ticed when we knew them to lie in the road to England.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed Offenburg, on the fir&s;t day of our return, and, travel|ling till midnight, as is cu&s;tomary in Germany during the &s;ummer, traver&s;ed the unu&s;ual &s;pace of fifty miles in fourteen hours. Soon after pa&s;&s;ing Appenweyer we overtook the rear-guard of the army, the advanced party of which we had met at that place three nights before. The troops were then quartered in the villages near the road, and their narrow waggons were &s;ometimes drawn up on both &s;ides of it. They had probably but lately &s;eparated, for there were parties of French ladies and gentlemen, who &s;eemed to have taken the benefit of moonlight to be &s;pectators, and &s;ome of the glow-worms, that had been numerous on the banks, now glittered very prettily in the hair of the former.</P>
<P>At Biel, a &s;mall town, which we reached about midnight, the &s;treet was rendered nearly impa&s;&s;able by military carriages, and we were &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that every room in the inn was not occupied by troops; but one mu&s;t have been very fa&s;tidious to have complained of any part of our reception here. As to lodging, though the apart|ment was as bare as is u&s;ual in Germany, there was the in&s;cription of <Q REND="inline">"Chambre de Mon&s;ieur"</Q> over the door, and on another near it <Q REND="inline">"Chambre de Cond&eacute; le Grand;"</Q> per&s;onages, who, it appeared, had once been accommodated there, for the honour of which the land|lord
<PB N="279" REF="287">
cho&s;e to retain their in&s;criptions. Their meeting here was pro|bably in 1791, &s;oon after the departure of the former from France.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day's journey brought us again to Schwetzingen, from whence we hoped to have reached Manheim, that night; but the po&s;t hor&s;es were all out, and none others could be hired, the village being obliged to furni&s;h a certain number for the carriage of &s;tores to the Au&s;trian army. Eighteen of the&s;e we had met, an hour be|fore, drawing &s;lowly in one waggon, laden with cannon balls. We &s;tayed the following day at Manheim, and, on the next, reached Mentz, where our &s;tatement of the ob&s;truction at Friburg excited le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e than indignation, the want of agreement between the Au&s;trian and Pru&s;&s;ian officers being &s;uch, that the former, who are frequently per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t education, are &s;aid to neglect no opportunity of preying upon accidental mi&s;takes in pa&s;&s;ports, or other bu&s;ine&s;s, committed by the Pru&s;&s;ians. Before our departure we were, however, a&s;&s;ured, that a proper repre&s;entation of the affair had been &s;ent by the fir&s;t e&s;taffette to the Commandant at Friburg.</P>
<P>Further intelligence of the cour&s;e of affairs in Flanders was now made known in Germany; and our regrets, relative to Switzerland, were le&s;&s;ened by the apparent probability, that a return homeward might in a few months be rendered difficult by &s;ome &s;till more un|fortunate events to the allies. Several effects of the late rever&s;es and &s;ymptoms of the general alarm were indeed already apparent at Mentz. Our inn was filled with refugees not only from Flanders, but from Liege, which the French had not then threatened. Some of the emigrants of the latter nation, in quitting the places where they
<PB N="280" REF="288">
had temporarily &s;ettled, abandoned their only means of livelihood, and &s;everal parties arrived in a &s;tate almo&s;t too di&s;tre&s;sful to be repeated. Ladies and children, who had pa&s;&s;ed the night in fields, came with &s;o little property, and &s;o little appearance of any, that they were refu&s;ed admittance at many inns; for &s;ome others, it &s;eemed, after re&s;ting a day or two, could offer only tears and lamentations, in&s;tead of payment. Our good landlord, Philip Bolz, relieved &s;everal, and others had a little charity from individuals; but, as far as we &s;aw and heard, the Germans very &s;eldom afforded them even the con|&s;olations of compa&s;&s;ion and tender manners.</P>
<P>Mentz is the u&s;ual place of embarkment for a voyage down the Rhine, the celebrated &s;cenery of who&s;e banks we determined to view, as &s;ome compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of Switzerland. We were al&s;o glad to e&s;cape a repetition of the fatigues of travel by land, now that the&s;e were to be attended with the uncertainties occa&s;ioned by any unu&s;ual influx of travellers upon the roads.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;upplying po&s;t-hor&s;es is here not the private undertaking of the innkeepers; &s;o that the emulation and civility, which might be excited by their views of profit, are entirely wanting. The Prince de la Tour Taxis is the Hereditary Grand Po&s;t-ma&s;ter of the Empire, an office, which has rai&s;ed his family from the &s;tation of private Counts, to a &s;eat in the College of Princes. He has a mono|poly of the profits ari&s;ing from this concern, for which he is obliged to forward all the Imperial packets gratis. A &s;ettled number of hor&s;es and a po&s;t-ma&s;ter are kept at every &s;tage; where the arms of the Prince, and &s;ome line entreating a ble&s;&s;ing upon the po&s;t, di&s;tin|gui&s;h
<PB N="281" REF="289">
the door of his office. The po&s;tma&s;ter determines, according to the number of travellers and the quantity of baggage, how many hor&s;es mu&s;t be hired; three per&s;ons cannot be allowed to proceed with le&s;s than three hor&s;es, and he will generally endeavour to &s;end out as many hor&s;es as there are per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The price for each hor&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed at one florin, or twenty pence per po&s;t, but, on account of the war, a florin and an half is now paid; half a florin is al&s;o due for the carriage; and the po&s;til|lion is entitled to a trinkgeld, or drink-money, of another half flo|rin; but, unle&s;s he is promi&s;ed more than this at the beginning of the &s;tage, he will proceed only at the regulated pace of four hours for each po&s;t, which may be reckoned at ten or twelve Engli&s;h miles. We &s;oon learned the way of quickening him, and, in the Palatinate and the Bri&s;gau, where the roads are good, could proceed nearly as fa&s;t as we wi&s;hed, amounting to about five miles an hour.</P>
<P>If the po&s;tma&s;ter &s;upplies a carriage, he demands half a florin per &s;tage for it; but the whole expence of a chai&s;e and two hor&s;es, includ|ing the tolls and the <HI>trinkgeld,</HI> which word the po&s;tillions accommo|date to Engli&s;h ears by pronouncing it <HI>drinkhealth,</HI> does not exceed eight pence per mile. We are, however, to caution all per&s;ons again&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing, as we did, that the chai&s;es of the po&s;t mu&s;t be pro|per ones, and that the nece&s;&s;ity of buying a carriage, which may be urged to them, is merely that of &s;hew; the&s;e chai&s;es are more incon|venient and filthy, than any travelling carriage, &s;een in England, can give an idea of, and a &s;tranger &s;hould not enter Germany, before he
<PB N="282" REF="290">
has purcha&s;ed a carriage, which will probably co&s;t twenty pounds in Holland and &s;ell for fifteen, at his return. Having neglected this, we e&s;caped from the <HI>chai&s;es de po&s;te</HI> as often as po&s;&s;ible, by hiring tho&s;e of voituriers, who&s;e price is about half as much again as that of the po&s;t.</P>
<P>The regular drivers wear a &s;ort of uniform, con&s;i&s;ting of a yellow coat, with black cuffs and cape, a &s;mall bugle horn, &s;lung over the &s;houlders, and a yellow &s;a&s;h. At the entrance of towns and narrow pa&s;&s;es, they &s;ometimes &s;ound the horn, playing upon it a perfect and not unplea&s;ant tune, the mu&s;ic of their order. All other carriages give way to theirs, and per&s;ons travelling with them are con&s;idered to be under the protection of the Empire; &s;o that, if they were rob|bed, information would be forwarded from one po&s;t-hou&s;e to another throughout all Germany, and it would become a common cau&s;e to detect the aggre&s;&s;ors. On this account, and becau&s;e there can be no concealment in a country &s;o little populous, highway robberies are almo&s;t unknown in it, and the fear of them is never men|tioned. The Germans, who, in &s;ummer, travel chiefly by night, are &s;eldom armed, and are &s;o far from thinking even watchfulne&s;s nece&s;|&s;ary, that mo&s;t of their carriages, though open in front, during the day-time, are contrived with curtains and benches, in order to pro|mote re&s;t. The po&s;t-ma&s;ters al&s;o a&s;&s;ure you, that, if there were rob|bers, they would content them&s;elves with attacking private voituriers, without violating the &s;acredne&s;s of the po&s;t; and the &s;ecurity of the po&s;tillions is &s;o &s;trictly attended to, that no man dare &s;trike them,
<PB N="283" REF="291">
while they have the yellow coat on. In di&s;putes with their pa&s;&s;en|gers they have, therefore, &s;ometimes been known to put off this coat, in order to &s;hew, that they do not claim the extraordinary protection of the laws.</P>
<P>The&s;e po&s;tillions acknowledge no obligation to travellers, who u&s;ual|ly give double what can be demanded, and &s;eem to con&s;ider them only as &s;o many bales of goods, which they are under a contract with the po&s;tma&s;ter to deliver at a certain place and within a certain time. Knowing, that their &s;lowne&s;s, if there is no addition to their <HI>trinkgeld,</HI> is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to compel &s;ome gratuity, they do not depart from the German luxury of incivility, and frequently return no an&s;wer, when they are que&s;tioned, as to di&s;tance, or de&s;ired to call the &s;ervant of an inn, or to quit the wor&s;t part of a road. When you tell them, that they &s;hall have a good <HI>drinkhealth</HI> for &s;peed, they reply, <Q REND="inline">"Yaw, yaw;"</Q> and, after that, think it unnece&s;&s;ary to reply to any enquiry till they a&s;k you for the money at the end of a &s;tage. They are all pro|vided with tobacco boxes and combu&s;tible bark, on which they &s;top to &s;trike with a &s;lint and &s;teel, immediately after leaving their town; in the hotte&s;t day and on the mo&s;t du&s;ty road, they will begin to &s;moke, though every whiff flies into the faces of the pa&s;&s;engers behind; and it mu&s;t be &s;ome very po&s;itive interference, that prevents them from continuing it.</P>
<P>As long as there are hor&s;es not engaged at any po&s;t-hou&s;e, the people are bound to &s;upply travellers, within half an hour after their arrival; but all the German Princes and many of their Mini&s;ters are
<PB N="284" REF="292">
permitted to engage the whole &s;tock on the road they intend to pa&s;s; and it frequently happens, that individuals may be detained a day, or even two, by &s;uch an order, if there &s;hould be no voiturier to furni&s;h them with others. At Cologne and Bonn, when we were fir&s;t there, all the hor&s;es were ordered for the Emperor, who pa&s;&s;ed through, however, with only one carriage, accompanied by an Aide-de-camp and followed by two &s;ervants, on hor&s;eback. It happens al&s;o fre|quently, that a &s;udden throng of private travellers has employed the whole &s;tock of the po&s;t-ma&s;ters; and the pre&s;ent emigrations from Liege and Juliers, we were a&s;&s;ured, had filled the roads &s;o much, that we might be frequently detained in &s;mall towns, and &s;hould find even the be&s;t overwhelmed with crowds of fugitives.</P>
<P>During a &s;tay of five days at Mentz, we often wandered amid&s;t the ruins of the late &s;iege, e&s;pecially on the &s;ite of the Favorita, from whence the maje&s;tic Rhine is &s;een rolling from one chain of mountains to another. Near this &s;pot, and not le&s;s fortunately &s;itu|ated, &s;tood a Carthu&s;ian convent, known in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory for having been the head-quarters of George the Second, in the year 1743, &s;oon after the battle of Dettingen. The apartments, u&s;ed by this monarch, were pre&s;erved in the &s;tate, in which he left them, till a &s;hort time before the late &s;iege, when the whole building was demoli&s;hed, &s;o that &s;carcely a trace of it now remains.</P>
<P>By our enquiries for a pa&s;&s;age ve&s;&s;el we di&s;covered the unplea&s;ant truth, that the dread of another inva&s;ion began now to be felt at Mentz, where, a fortnight before, not a &s;ymptom of it was di&s;|cernible.
<PB N="285" REF="293">
Several of the inhabitants had hired boats to be in readi|ne&s;s for tran&s;porting their effects to Franckfort, if the French &s;hould approach much nearer to the Rhine; and our friends, when we mentioned the circum&s;tance, confe&s;&s;ed, that they were preparing for a removal to Saxony. The &s;tate of the ar&s;enal had been lately enquired into, and a deficiency, which was whi&s;pered to have been di&s;covered in the gunpowder, was imputed to the want of cordiality between the Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians, of whom the latter, being uncertain that they &s;hould &s;tay in the place, had refu&s;ed to repleni&s;h the &s;tores, at their own expence, and the former would not &s;pare their ammunition, till the departure of the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;hould leave it to be guarded by them&s;elves. The communication with the other &s;hore of the Rhine, by the bridge and the fortifications of Ca&s;&s;el, &s;ecured, however, to a German garri&s;on the opportunity of receiving &s;upplies, even if the French &s;hould occupy all the we&s;tern bank of the river.</P>

<HEAD>VOYAGE DOWN THE RHINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE boats, to be hired at Mentz, are awkward imita|tions of the Dutch trecht&s;chuyts, or what, upon the Thames, would be called Hou&s;e-boats; but, for the &s;ake of being allowed to di&s;|po&s;e of one as the varieties of the voyage &s;hould &s;eem to tempt, we gave four louis for the u&s;e of a cabin, between Mentz and Cologne; the boatmen being permitted to take pa&s;&s;engers in the other part of the ve&s;&s;el. In this we embarked at &s;ix o'clock, on a delightful morning in the latter end of July, and, as we left the &s;hore, had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the city in a new point of view, the mo&s;t picture&s;que we had &s;een. Its principal features were the high quays called the Rhein&s;tra&s;&s;e, the ca&s;tellated palace, with its gothic turrets, of pale red &s;tone, the ar&s;enal, the lofty ramparts, far extended along the river, and the northern gate; the long bridge of boats completed the fore-ground, and &s;ome fore&s;t hills the picture.</P>
<P>We &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the wooded i&s;land, called <HI>Peters-au,</HI> of &s;o much con&s;equence, during the &s;iege, for its command of the bridge; and, approaching the mountains of the Rheingau to the north, the mo&s;t &s;ublime in this horizon, &s;aw their &s;ummits veiled in clouds, while the &s;un &s;oon melted the mi&s;ts, that dimmed their lower &s;ides, and brought out their various colouring of wood, corn and &s;oils. It was, how|ever, nearly two hours before the windings of the Rhine per|mitted
<PB N="287" REF="295">
us to reach any of their ba&s;es. Meanwhile the river flowed through highly cultivated plains, chiefly of corn, with villages thickly &s;cattered on its banks, in which are the country hou&s;es of the richer inhabitants of Mentz, among plea&s;ant orchards and vineyards. Tho&s;e on the right bank are in the dominions of the Prince of Na&s;&s;au U&s;ingen, who has a large chateau in the mid&s;t of them, once tenanted, for a night, by George the Second, and the Duke of Cumberland.</P>
<P>The Rhine is here, and for &s;everal leagues downward, of a very noble breadth, perhaps wider than in any other part of its Ger|man cour&s;e; and its &s;urface is animated by many i&s;lands covered with poplars and low wood. The we&s;tern &s;hore, often fringed with pine and elms, is flat; but the ea&s;tern begins to &s;well into hillocks near Wallauf, the la&s;t village of Na&s;&s;au U&s;ingen, and once &s;omewhat fortified.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Rheingau,</HI> or the country of the vines, commences, and we approached the northern mountains, which ri&s;e on the right in &s;ine &s;weeping undulations. The&s;e increa&s;ed in dignity as we ad|vanced, and their &s;ummits then appeared to be darkened with heath and woods, which form part of the exten&s;ive fore&s;t of <HI>Lande&s;wald,</HI> or <HI>Woodland.</HI> Hitherto the &s;cenery had been open and plea&s;ant only, but now the ea&s;tern &s;hore began to be romantic, &s;tarting into heights, &s;o abrupt, that the vineyards almo&s;t overhung the river, and opening to fore&s;t glens, among the mountains. Still, however, towns and villages perpetually occurred, and the banks of the river were populous, though not a ve&s;&s;el be&s;ides our own appeared upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="296">
On the ea&s;tern margin are two &s;mall towns, Oder and Niederingel|heim, which, in the mid&s;t of the dominions of Mentz, belong to the Elector Palatine. On this &s;hore al&s;o is made one of the celebrated wines of the Rhine, called Markerbrunner, which ranks next to tho&s;e of Johanne&s;berg and Hockheim. At no great di&s;tance on the &s;ame &s;hore, but beneath a bank &s;omewhat more abrupt, is the former of the&s;e places, alienated in the &s;ixteenth century from the dominions of Mentz, to tho&s;e of the Abbot, now Prince Bi&s;hop of Fulde.</P>
<P>The wine of the neighbouring &s;teeps is the highe&s;t priced of all the numerous &s;orts of Rheni&s;h; a bottle &s;elling upon the &s;pot, where it is lea&s;t likely to be pure, for three, four, or five &s;hillings, according to the vintages, the merits and di&s;tinctions of which are in the memory of almo&s;t every German. That of 1786 was the mo&s;t celebrated &s;ince 1779; but we continually heard that the heat of 1794 would render this year equal in fame to any of the others.</P>
<P>Behind the village is the large and well-built abbey of Johanne&s;|berg, rich with all this produce, for the &s;ecurity of which there are immen&s;e cellars, cut in the rock below, &s;aid to be capable of contain|ing &s;everal thou&s;and tons of wine. The abbey was founded in 1105; and there is a long hi&s;tory of changes pertaining to it, till it came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Abbot of Fulde, who rebuilt it in its pre&s;ent &s;tate. This part of the Rheingau is, indeed, thickly &s;et with &s;imilar edi&s;ices, having, in a &s;hort &s;pace, the nunnery of Marienthal, and the mona|&s;teries of Nothgottes, Aulenhau&s;en, and Eibingen.</P>
<P>Further on is the large modern chateau of Count O&s;tein, a
<PB N="289" REF="297">
nobleman of great wealth, and, as it appears, of not le&s;s ta&s;te. Hav|ing di&s;po&s;ed all his nearer grounds in a &s;tyle for the mo&s;t part Engli&s;h, he has had recour&s;e to the ridge of precipices, that ri&s;e over the river, for &s;ublimity and grandeur of pro&s;pect. On the brink of the&s;e woody heights, &s;everal pavilions have been erected, from the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of which Coblentz, it is &s;aid, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, at the di&s;tance of forty miles. The view mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hingly grand, for to the &s;outh-ea&s;t the eye overlooks all the fine country of the Rheingau to Mentz; to the we&s;t, the cour&s;e of the Mo&s;elle towards. France; and, to the north, the chaos of wild mountains, that &s;creen the Rhine in its progre&s;s to Coblentz.</P>
<P>So general was the alarm of inva&s;ion, that Count O&s;tein had already withdrawn into the interior of Germany, and was endea|vouring to di&s;po&s;e of this charming re&s;idence, partly protected as it is by the river, at the very di&s;advantageous price now paid for e&s;tates on the we&s;tern frontier of the Empire.</P>
<P>The vineyards, that &s;ucceed, are proofs of the indu&s;try and &s;kill to which the Germans are accu&s;tomed in this part of their labours, the &s;eanty &s;oil being prevented from falling down the almo&s;t perpendicu|lar rocks, by walls that frequently require &s;ome new toil from the careful farmer. Every addition, made to the mould, mu&s;t be carried in ba&s;kets up the &s;teep paths, or rather &s;tairca&s;es, cut in the &s;olid rock. At the time of the vintage, when the&s;e precipices are thronged with people, and the &s;ounds of merriment are echoed along them, the &s;pectacle mu&s;t here be as &s;triking and gay as can be painted by fancy.</P>

<HEAD>BINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT eleven o'clock, we reached Bingen, a town of which the antiquity is &s;o clear, that one of its gates is &s;till called Dru|&s;ithor, or, the gate of Dru&s;us. Its appearance, however, is neither rendered venerable by age, or neat by novelty. The pre&s;ent build|ings were all rai&s;ed in the di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion produced in 1689, after Louis the Fourteenth had blown up the fortifications, that endured a tedious &s;iege in the beginning of the century, and had de|&s;troyed the city, in which Dru&s;us is &s;aid to have died.</P>
<P>It has now the appearance, which we have often mentioned is characteri&s;tic of mo&s;t German towns, nearly every hou&s;e being covered with &s;ymptoms of decay and neglect, and the &s;treets aban|doned to a few idle pa&s;&s;engers. Yet Bingen has the advantage of &s;tanding at the conflux of two rivers, the Nahe making there its junction with the Rhine; and an antient German book mentions it as the central place of an hundred villages, or chateaux, the inhabi|tants of which might come to its market and return between &s;un-ri&s;e and &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>Since the revolution in France, it has occa&s;ionally been much the re&s;idence of emigrants; and, in a plain behind the town, which was pointed out to us, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia reviewed their army before the entrance into France in 1792. A part of his &s;peech was re|peated
<PB N="291" REF="299">
to us by a gentleman who bore a high commi&s;&s;ion in it; <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, be tranquil and happy; in a little time I &s;hall conduct you to your homes and your property."</Q></P>
<P>Our companion, as he remembered the hopes excited by this &s;peech, was deeply affected; an emigrant officer, of whom, as well as of an Ex-Nobleman of the &s;ame nation, with the latter of whom we parted here, we mu&s;t pau&s;e to &s;ay, that had the old &s;y&s;tem in France, oppre&s;&s;ive as it was, and injurious as Engli&s;hmen were once ju&s;tly taught to believe it, been univer&s;ally admini&s;tered by men of their mildne&s;s, integrity and benevolence, it could not have been entirely overthrown by all the theories, or all the eloquence in the world.</P>
<P>Soon after this review, the march commenced; the general effect of which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat. When the retreat was ordered, the emigrant army, compri&s;ing &s;eventy &s;quadrons of cavalry, was declared by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to be di&s;banded, and not any per&s;on was allowed to retain an hor&s;e, or arms. No other purcha&s;ers were pre&s;ent but the Pru&s;&s;ians, and, in con&s;equence of this order, the &s;ine&s;t hor&s;es, many of which had co&s;t forty louis each, were now &s;old for four or five, &s;ome even for one! It re&s;ulted accidentally, no doubt, from this mea&s;ure, that the Pru&s;&s;ian army was thus reprovided with hor&s;es almo&s;t as cheaply as if they had &s;eized them from Dumourier.</P>
<P>Bingen was taken by the French in the latter end of the cam|paign of 1792, and was then nearly the northernmo&s;t of their po&s;ts on the Rhine. It was regained by the Pru&s;&s;ians in their advances
<PB N="292" REF="300">
to Mentz, at the commencement of the next campaign, and has &s;ince occa&s;ionally &s;erved them as a dep&ocirc;t of &s;tores.</P>
<P>This town, &s;eated on the low we&s;tern margin, &s;urrounded with its old walls, and overtopped by its ruined ca&s;tle, harmonizes well with the gloomy grandeur near it; and here the a&s;pect of the country changes to a character awfully wild. The Rhine, after expanding to a great breadth, at its conflux with the Nahe, &s;uddenly contracts it&s;elf, and winds with an abrupt and rapid &s;weep among the dark and tremendous rocks, that clo&s;e the per&s;pective. Then, di&s;appearing beyond them, it leaves the imagination to paint the dangers of its cour&s;e. Near the entrance of this clo&s;e pa&s;s, &s;tands the town of Bin|gen, immediately oppo&s;ite to which appear the ruins of the ca&s;tle of Ehrenfels, on a cliff highly elevated above the water, broken, craggy and impending, but with vines crawling in narrow crevices, and other rocks &s;till a&s;piring above it. On an i&s;land between the&s;e &s;hores, is a third ruined ca&s;tle, very antient, and of which little more than one tower remains. This is called Mau&s;thurm, or, The Tower of the Rats, from a marvellous tradition, that, in the tenth century, an Archbi&s;hop Statto was devoured there by the&s;e animals, after many cruelties to the poor, whom he called Rats, that eat the bread of the rich.</P>

<HEAD>EHRENFELS.</HEAD>
<P>EHRENFELS is &s;ynonymous to Maje&s;tic, or Noble Rock; and Fels, which is the pre&s;ent term for rock in all the northern coun|ties of England, as well as in Germany, is among &s;everal in&s;tances of exact &s;imilarity, as there are many of re&s;emblance, between the pre|&s;ent Briti&s;h and German languages. A German of the &s;outhern di&s;tricts, meaning to enquire what you would have, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Was woll zu haben?</HI>"</Q> and in the north there is a &s;ort of Patois, called <HI>Plat Deut&s;che,</HI> which brings the words much nearer to our own.

To expre&s;s a temperate appro|bation of what they hear, the Germans &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"So&mdash;&s;o;"</Q> pronoun|cing the words &s;lowly and long; exactly as our brethren of Scot|land would. In a printed narrative of the &s;iege of Mentz there is this pa&s;&s;age, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Funfzehn hundert men&s;chen, mei&s;tens weiber und kin|der&mdash;wanderten mit dem bundel under dem arm uber die brucke;</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Fifteen hundred per&s;ons, mo&s;tly wives and children, wan|dered, with their bundles under their arms, upon the bridge. So permanent has been the influence over our language, which the Saxons acquired by their e&s;tabli&s;hment of more than five centuries among&s;t us; exiling the antient Briti&s;h tongue to the mountains of Scotland and Wales; and afterwards, when incorporated with this,
<PB N="294" REF="302">
re&s;i&s;ting the per&s;ecution of the Normans; rather improving than yielding under their endeavours to extirpate it. The injuries of the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who, in Henry the Second's time, was de|prived of his &s;ee for being <Q REND="inline">"<HI>an Engli&s;h idcot, that could not &s;peak French,</HI>"</Q> one would fondly imagine had the effect due to all per&s;ecu|tions, that of &s;trengthening, not &s;ubduing their objects.</P>
<P>After parting with &s;ome of the friends, who had accompanied us from Mentz, and taking in provi&s;ion for the voyage, our oars were again plyed, and we approached Bingerloch, the commencement of that tremendous pa&s;s of rocky mountains, which enclo&s;e the Rhine nearly as far as Coblentz. Bingerloch is one of the mo&s;t dangerous parts of the river; that, being here at once impelled by the waters of the Nahe, compre&s;&s;ed by the projection of its boundaries, and irritated by hidden rocks in its current, makes an abrupt de&s;cent, frequently rendered further dangerous by whirlpools. Several Ger|man authors a&s;&s;ert, that a part of the Rhine here takes a channel beneath its general bed, from which it does not i&s;&s;ue, till it reaches St. Goar, a di&s;tance of probably twenty miles. The &s;orce and rapi|dity of the &s;tream, the a&s;pect of the dark disjointed cliffs, under which we pa&s;&s;ed, and the &s;trength of the wind, oppo&s;ing our en|trance among their cha&s;ms, and uniting with the &s;ounding force of the waters to baffle the dexterity of the boatmen, who &s;trug|gled hard to prevent the ve&s;&s;el from being whirled round, were circum&s;tances of the true &s;ublime, in&s;piring terror in &s;ome and admiration in a high degree.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="303">
Reviewing this now, in the lei&s;ure of recollection, the&s;e nervous lines of Thom&s;on appear to de&s;cribe much of the &s;cene:<Q><L>The rous'd up river pours along;</L>
<L>Re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, roaring, dreadful, down it comes</L>
<L>From the rude mountain, and the mo&s;&s;y wild,</L>
<L>Tumbling through rocks abrupt, and &s;ounding far;</L>
<L>&mdash; again con&s;train'd</L>
<L>Between two meeting hills, it bur&s;ts away,</L>
<L>Where rocks and woods o'erhang the turbid &s;tream;</L>
<L>There gathering triple force, rapid, and deep,</L>
<L>It boils, and wheels, and foams, and thunders through.</L></Q></P>
<P>Having doubled the &s;harp promontory, that alters the cour&s;e of the river, we &s;aw in per&s;pective &s;ometimes perpendicular rocks, and then mountains dark with dwarf-woods, &s;hooting their precipices over the margin of the water; a boundary which, for many leagues, was not broken, on either margin, except where, by &s;ome &s;light receding, the rocks embo&s;omed villages, lying on the edge of the river, and once guarded them by the antient ca&s;tles on their points. A &s;tormy day, with frequent &s;howers, ob&s;cured the &s;cenery, making it appear dreary, without increa&s;ing its gloomy grandeur; but we had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve every venerable ruin, that &s;eemed to tell the religious, or military hi&s;tory of the country. The fir&s;t of the&s;e beyond Bingen, is the old ca&s;tle of Bauzberg, and, next, the church of St. Clement, built in a place once greatly infe&s;ted by robbers. There are then the
<PB N="296" REF="304">
modern ca&s;tle of Konig&s;tein, in which the French were be&s;ieged in 1793, and the remains of the old one, de&s;erted for more than two hundred years. Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e is the village of A&s;&s;mans, or Ha&s;eman&s;hau&s;en, celebrated for the flavour of its wines; and near them was formerly a warm bath, &s;upplied by a &s;pring, now lo&s;t from its &s;ource to the Rhine, notwith&s;tanding many expen&s;ive &s;earches to regain it. About a mile farther, is the antient ca&s;tle of Falkenburg, and below it the village of Drech&s;en; then the ruins of an exten&s;ive chateau, called Sonneck, beneath which the Rhine expands, and encircles two &s;mall i&s;lands, that conclude the di&s;trict of the Rheingau.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing the &s;mall town of Lorrich, on the ea&s;tern bank, the Rhine is again &s;traightened by rocky precipices, and rolls ha&s;tily pa&s;t the antient ca&s;tle of Fur&s;tenberg, which gives its name to one of the deare&s;t wines of the Rhine.</P>
<P>We now reached Bacharach, a town on the left bank of the river, &s;orming part of the widely &s;cattered dominions of the Elector Pala|tine, who has attended to its pro&s;perity by permitting the Calvini&s;ts and Lutherans to e&s;tabli&s;h their forms of wor&s;hip there, under equal privileges with the Roman Catholics.</P>
<P>It has a con&s;iderable commerce in Rheni&s;h wine; and its toll|hou&s;e, near which all ve&s;&s;els are compelled to &s;top, adds con&s;iderably to the revenues of the Palatinate. For the purpo&s;e of enforcing the&s;e, the antient ca&s;tle called Stahleck, founded in 1190, was probably built; for Bacharach is the olde&s;t town of the Palatinate, and has
<PB N="297" REF="305">
&s;carcely any hi&s;tory between the period when it was annexed to that dominion and the departure of the Romans, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have given it the name of <HI>Bacchi ara,</HI> and to have performed &s;ome ceremonies to that deity upon a &s;tone, &s;aid to be &s;till concealed in the Rhine. In the year 1654, 1695, 1719, and 1750, when the river was remarkably low, this &s;tone is recorded to have been &s;een near the oppo&s;ite i&s;land of Worth, and the country people have given it the name of the <HI>Aelter&s;tein.</HI> As this extreme lowne&s;s of the waters never happens but in the hotte&s;t years, the &s;ight of the Aelter&s;tein is earne&s;tly de&s;ired, as the &s;ymptom of a pro&s;perous vintage. The river was unu&s;ually low when we pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land, but we looked in vain for this &s;tone, which is &s;aid to be &s;o large, that five-and-twenty per&s;ons may &s;tand upon its &s;urface.</P>
<P>Bacharach is in the li&s;t of places, ruined by Louis the Fourteenth in 1689. The whole town was then &s;o carefully and methodically plundered that the French commander, during the la&s;t night of his &s;tay, had nothing to &s;leep on but &s;traw; and, the next day, this bedding was employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to &s;et fire to the town, which was pre&s;ently reduced to a&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>PFALTZ.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT a mile lower is the i&s;land of Pfaltz, or Pfalz|grafen&s;tein, a place of &s;uch antient importance in the hi&s;tory of the Palatinate, that it has given its name to the whole territory in Ger|many called Pfaltz. It was probably the fir&s;t re&s;idence of the Counts, the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which was one means of atte&s;ting the right to the Palatinate; for, as a &s;ign of &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was antiently nece&s;&s;ary, that the heir apparent &s;hould be born in a ca&s;tle, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in a repaired &s;tate upon it.

The officers do not even think it nece&s;&s;ary to wait at home for this information, and our boatmen had frequently to &s;earch for them throughout the towns. So familiar, however, is this inju&s;tice, that it never appeared to excite &s;urpri&s;e, or anger. The boatman dares not proceed till he has found and &s;atisfied the officers; nor has he any means of compelling them to be punctual. Ours was a&s;toni&s;hed when we enquired, whether the merchants, to whom &s;uch delays might be important, could not have redre&s;s for them.</P>
<P>The &s;tay we made at Kaub enabled us, however, to perceive that fine &s;late made a con&s;iderable part of its traffic.</P>
<P>The Rhine, at Bacharach and Kaub, is of great breadth; and the dark mountains, that a&s;cend from its margin, form a grand vi&s;ta, with antient chateaux &s;till appearing on the heights, and frequent villages edging the &s;tream, or &s;tudded among the cliffs.</P>

<P>A vineyard, newly manured, produces a &s;trong, &s;pirited and well|flavoured, but u&s;ually an unwhole&s;ome wine; becau&s;e the manure contains a corro&s;ive &s;alt and a fat &s;ulphur, which, being di&s;&s;olved, pa&s;&s;es with the juices of the earth into the vines. A manure, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;treet mud, old earth, the ruins of hou&s;es well broken, and whatever has been much expo&s;ed to the elements, is, however, laid on, once in five or &s;ix years, between the vintage and winter.</P>
<P>The &s;orts of vines, cultivated in the <HI>Rheingau,</HI> are the low ones, called the <HI>Rei&s;tinge,</HI> which are the mo&s;t common and ripen the fir&s;t; tho&s;e of <HI>Klebroth,</HI> or red Burgundy, the wine of which is nearly purple; of Orleans and of Lambert; and la&s;tly the tall vine, rai&s;ed again&s;t hou&s;es, or &s;upported by bowers in gardens.

<P>The vintagers do not pluck the branches by hand, but carefully cut them, that the grapes may not fall off; in the Rheingau and about Worms the cultivators afterwards brui&s;e them with clubs, but tho&s;e of Franckfort with their feet; after which the grapes are car|ried to the pre&s;s, and the wine flows from them by wooden pipes into barrels in the cellar. That, which flows upon the fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, is the mo&s;t delicately flavoured, but the weake&s;t; the next is &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t bri&s;k; the third is four; but the mixture of all forms a good wine.

<HEAD>OBERWESEL,</HEAD>
<P>THE account of which has been interrupted by this digre&s;&s;ion, is the fir&s;t town of the Electorate of Treves, on this &s;ide, to which it has belonged &s;ince 1312, when its freedom as an imperial city, granted by the Emperor, Frederic the Second, was per|&s;idiou&s;ly &s;eized by Henry the Seventh, and the town given to him by his brother Baldwin, the then Elector. The new Sovereign enriched it with a fine collegiate church, which &s;till dignifies the &s;hore of the river. If he u&s;ed any other endeavours to make the pro&s;perity of the place &s;urvive its liberties, they appear to have failed; for Ober|we&s;el now re&s;embles the other towns of the Electorate, except that the great number of towers and &s;teeples tell what it was before its declen&s;ion into that territory. The Town-hou&s;e, rendered unnece&s;|&s;ary by the power of Baldwin, does not exi&s;t to in&s;ult the inhabi|tants
<PB N="304" REF="312">
with the memory of its former u&s;e; but is in ruins, and thus &s;erves for an emblem of the effects, produced by the change.</P>
<P>Between Oberwe&s;el and St. Goar, the river is of extraordinary breadth, and the maje&s;tic mountains are covered with fore&s;ts, which leave &s;pace for little more than a road between their feet and the wa|ter. A group of pea&s;ants, with ba&s;kets on their heads, appeared now and then along the winding path, and their diminutive figures, as they pa&s;&s;ed under the cliffs, &s;eemed to make the heights &s;hew more tremendous. When they di&s;appeared for a moment in the cop&s;es, their voices, echoing with &s;everal repetitions among the rocks, were heard at intervals, and with good effect, as our oars were &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>Soon after pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;land of Sand, we had a per&s;pective view of St. Goar, of the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Rhinfels, on the rocks beyond, and of the &s;mall fortified town of Goarhau&s;en, on the oppo&s;ite bank. The mountains now become &s;till more &s;tupendous, and many rivu|lets, or <HI>becks,</HI> which latter is a German, as well as an Engli&s;h term, de&s;cend from them into the river, on either hand, &s;ome of which, in a &s;ea&s;on le&s;s dry than the pre&s;ent, roar with angry torrents. But the extreme violence, with which the Rhine pa&s;&s;es in this di&s;trict, left us le&s;s lei&s;ure than in others to ob&s;erve its &s;cenery.</P>

<HEAD>ST. GOAR.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;oon reached St. Goar, lying at the feet of rocks on the we&s;tern &s;hore, with its ramparts and fortifications &s;preading far along the water, and mounting in &s;everal lines among the &s;urround|ing cliffs, &s;o as to have a very &s;triking and romantic appearance. The Rhine no where, perhaps, pre&s;ents grander objects either of nature, or of art, than in the northern per&s;pective from St. Goar. There, expanding with a bold &s;weep, the river exhibits, at one coup d'oeil, on its mountainous &s;hores, &s;ix fortre&s;&s;es or towns, many of them placed in the mo&s;t wild and tremendous &s;ituations; their antient and gloomy &s;tructures giving ideas of the &s;ullen tyranny of former times. The height and fanta&s;tic &s;hapes of the rocks, upon which they are perched, or by which they are overhung, and the width and rapidity of the river, that, unchanged by the vici&s;&s;itudes of ages and the contentions on its &s;hores, has rolled at their feet, while generations, that made its mountains roar, have pa&s;&s;ed away into the &s;ilence of eternity,&mdash;the&s;e were objects, which, combined, formed one of the &s;ublime&s;t &s;cenes we had viewed.</P>
<P>The chief of the fortre&s;&s;es is that of Rhin&s;els, impending over St. Goar, on the we&s;t &s;hore, its high round tower ri&s;ing above ma&s;&s;y buildings, that crown two rocks, of &s;uch enormous bulk and threat|ening power, that, as we glided under them, it was nece&s;&s;ary to re|member their fixed foundations, to &s;often the awe they in&s;pired.
<PB N="306" REF="314">
Other fortifications extend down the precipices, and margin the river, at their ba&s;e. Further on in the per&s;pective, and where the ea&s;t bank of the Rhine makes its bolde&s;t &s;weep, is the very &s;triking and &s;ingular ca&s;tle of Platz, a clu&s;ter of towers, overtopped by one of immen&s;e height, that, perched upon the &s;ummit of a pyramidal rock, &s;eems ready to precipitate it&s;elf into the water below. Wherever the cliffs beneath will admit of a footing, the &s;harp angles of fortifications appear.</P>
<P>On another rock, &s;till further in the per&s;pective, is the ca&s;tle of Thumberg, and, at its foot, on the edge of the water, the walled tower of Welmick. Here the Rhine winds from the eye among heights, that clo&s;e the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Nearly oppo&s;ite to St. Goar, is Goar&s;hau&s;&s;en, behind which the rocks ri&s;e &s;o &s;uddenly, as &s;carcely to leave &s;pace for the town to lie between them and the river. A flying bridge maintains a commu|nication between the two places, which, as well as the fortre&s;s of Rhinfels, are under the dominion of the Prince of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The number of fortre&s;&s;es here, over which Rhinfels is in every re&s;pect paramount, &s;eem to be the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the river it&s;elf, &s;uddenly &s;woln by many &s;treams and vexed by hidden rocks, is a &s;ort of natural fortification to both &s;hores, a very little re&s;i&s;t|ance from either of which mu&s;t render it impa&s;&s;able. Whether the water has a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age from Bingen hither or not, there are occa&s;ionally agitations in this part, which confound the &s;kill of naturali&s;ts; and the river is univer&s;ally allowed to have a fall. Near St. Goar, a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the current, ren|dered

our boat &s;o unmanageable, that, in &s;pite of its heavine&s;s and of all the efforts of the watermen, it was whirled round, and nearly forced upon the oppo&s;ite bank to that, on which they would have directed it.</P>
<P>St. Goar is a place of great antiquity. A di&s;pute about the etymo|logy of its name is remarkable for the ludicrous contrariety of the two opinions. One author maintains, that it is derived from an hermit named Goar, who, in the &s;ixth century, built a &s;mall chapel here. Another &s;uppo&s;es that Gewerb, the name of a neighbouring fall in the Rhine, has been corrupted to Gewer, and thence to Goar; after which, con&s;idering that there is an i&s;land called <HI>Sand</HI> in the river, and that a great quantity of that material is hereabouts thrown up, he finds the two words combine very &s;atisfactorily into a likene&s;s of the pre&s;ent denomination. The former opinion is, however, pro|moted by this circum&s;tance, which the advocates of the latter may complain of as a partiality, that a &s;tatue of St. Goar is actually to be &s;een in the great church, founded in 1440; and that, notwith&s;tanding the robberies and violences committed in the church by a Spani&s;h army, the following in&s;cription is &s;till entire: <Q>S. GOAR <LB>MONACHUS GALLUS <LB>OBIIT 611.</Q></P>
<P>St. Goar is one of the large&s;t places we had yet pa&s;&s;ed, and has a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the commerce carried on by the Rhine. Hav|ing

We were here required to pay the fifth toll from Mentz, and were vi&s;ited by a He&s;&s;ian &s;erjeant, who demanded, that our names and condition &s;hould be written in his book. The&s;e being given, not in the Saxon, but the Roman character, he returned to require another edition of them in German; &s;o that his officer was probably unable to read any other language, or characters. This being complied with, it &s;eemed, that the noble garri&s;on of St. Goar had no further fears concerning us, and we were not troubled by more of the precautions u&s;ed,

<P>The fortre&s;s of Rhinfels, which commands St. Goar, is frequently mentioned in the hi&s;tories of German wars. In the year 1255 it endured forty a&s;&s;aults of an army, combined from &s;ixty towns on the Rhine. In 1692, the French General Tallard be&s;ieged it in vain, retreating with the lo&s;s of four thou&s;and men, and nearly two hun|dred officers; but, in 1758, the Marquis de Ca&s;tries &s;urpri&s;ed it with &s;o much ingenuity and vigour, that not a life was lo&s;t, and it remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French till 1763, when it was re&s;tored by the treaty of peace.</P>

<HEAD>BOPPART.</HEAD>
<P>WE next reached the di&s;mal old town of Boppart, once an imperial city, &s;till &s;urrounded with venerable walls, and dignified by the fine Benedictine nunnery and abbey of Marienberg, perched upon a mountain above; an in&s;titution founded in the eleventh cen|tury, for the benefit of noble families only, and enriched by the dona|tions of &s;everal Emperors and Electors. Boppart, like many other towns, is built on the margin of the Rhine, whence it &s;preads up the rocks, that almo&s;t impend over the water, on which the clu&s;tered hou&s;es are &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from the cliffs them&s;elves. Be&s;ides the Benedictine abbey, here is a convent of Carmelites, and another of Franci&s;cans; and the &s;pot is &s;uch as &s;uited well the &s;uper&s;tition of former times, for<Q><L>&mdash;"O'er the twilight groves, and du&s;ky caves,</L>

At their ba&s;e, a few mi&s;erable cabins, and half-fami&s;hed vineyards, are all, that diver&s;ify the &s;avagene&s;s of the &s;cene. Here two Capuchins, belonging probably to the convent above, as they walked along the &s;hore, beneath the dark cliffs of Boppart, wrapt in the long black drapery of their order, and their heads &s;hrowded in cowls, that half concealed their faces, were inter|e&s;ting figures in a picture, always gloomily &s;ublime.</P>

<P>PASSING the town of Braubach and the maje&s;tic ca&s;tle of Mark&s;berg, which we had long ob&s;erved, above the windings of the &s;tream, on a &s;teep mountain, we came to Ren&s;e, a &s;mall town, remarkable only for its neighbourhood to a &s;pot, on which the elec|tions of kings of the Romans, or, at lea&s;t, the meetings preliminary to them, are believed to have antiently taken place.

<HEAD>INTERMIXTURE OF GERMAN TERRITORIES.</HEAD>
<P>NEARLY oppo&s;ite to <HI>Ren&s;e</HI> is the &s;mall town of <HI>Ober|lahn&s;tein,</HI> which belongs to the Elector of Mentz, though &s;eparated from his other dominions by tho&s;e of &s;everal Princes. To &s;uch inter|&s;ections of one territory with another the individual weakne&s;s of the German Princes is partly owing; while their collected body has not only nece&s;&s;arily the infirmities of each of its members, but is enfeebled by the counteraction ari&s;ing from an arrangement, which brings per|&s;ons together to decide a que&s;tion, according to a common intere&s;t, who are always likely to have an individual one of more import|ance to each than his &s;hare in the general concern.</P>
<P>The banks of the Rhine afford many in&s;tances of this disjunction of territory. The Elector of Cologn has a town to the &s;outhward of nearly all the dominions of Treves; the Elector Palatine, who&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions on the ea&s;t bank of the Rhine are inter&s;ected by tho&s;e of five
<PB N="312" REF="320">
or &s;ix other Princes, cro&s;&s;es the river to occupy &s;ome towns between the Electorates of Mentz and Treves; the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el does the &s;ame to his fortre&s;s of Rhinfels; and the Elector of Mentz, in return, has a &s;trip of land and his chief country re&s;idence, between the dominions of the two hou&s;es of He&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>That this intermixture of territory exi&s;ts, without producing do|me&s;tic violences, is, however, obviou&s;ly a proof, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Germanic body, weak as it may be, with re&s;pect to foreign intere&s;ts, is well formed for the pre&s;ervation of interior peace. The aggrandizement of the Hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia, which has been &s;uppo&s;ed dangerous to the con&s;titution of the Empire, tends con&s;iderably to &s;ecure its dome&s;tic tranquility, though it dimi|ni&s;hes the independence of the le&s;&s;er Sovereigns; for the intere&s;ts of the latter are known to be ranged on one, or the other &s;ide; and, as the Hou&s;e, to which each is attached, is likely to interfere, upon any aggre&s;&s;ion again&s;t them, the weaker Princes are with-held from con|te&s;ts among them&s;elves, which would be accompanied by wars, &s;o very exten&s;ive and &s;o di&s;proportionate to their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Nor is the Chamber of Wetzlaar, or the Court for deciding the cau&s;es of Princes, as well as all que&s;tions relative to the con&s;titution, to be con&s;idered as a nullity. The appointment of the judges by the free but &s;ecret votes of all Princes, &s;ubject to their decrees, is alone wanting to make its purity equal to its power. In minute que&s;tions, the chief Princes readily receive its deci&s;ion, in&s;tead of that of arms, which, without it, might &s;ometimes be adopted; and the other Sove|reigns
<PB N="313" REF="321">
may be compelled to obey it, the Chamber being authori&s;ed to command any Prince to enforce its decrees by his army, and to take payment of the expences out of the dominions of his refractory neigh|bour. An in&s;tance of &s;uch a command, and of its being virtually effectual, notwith&s;tanding the ridicule, with which it was treated, occurred, during the reign of the late Frederic of Pru&s;&s;ia; the &s;tory is variou&s;ly told, but the following account was confirmed to us by an Advocate of the Chamber of Wetzlaar.</P>
<P>The Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el had di&s;obeyed &s;everal injunctions of the Chamber, relative to a que&s;tion, which had been con&s;titution|ally &s;ubmitted to them. At length, the Judges had recour&s;e to their power of calling out what is called the <HI>Arm&eacute;e Ex&eacute;cutrice de l'Empire,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many troops of any Prince, not a party in the cau&s;e, as may be &s;ufficient for enforcing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The Sovereign of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el was not to be conquered by any of his immediate neigh|bours, and they were induced to direct their order to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, notwith&s;tanding the probability, that &s;o unju&s;t a monarch would &s;hew &s;ome re&s;entment of their controul.</P>
<P>Frederic con&s;ented to the propriety of &s;upporting the Chamber, but did not choo&s;e to involve him&s;elf with the Landgrave, on their account. He, therefore, &s;ent him a copy of their order, accompanied by a letter, which, in his own &s;tyle of courteous plea&s;antry, yet with a &s;ufficient &s;hew of &s;ome further intentions, admoni&s;hed him to obey them. The Landgrave a&s;&s;ured him of his readine&s;s to conform, and the two Princes had privately &s;ettled the matter, when the King of
<PB N="314" REF="322">
Pru&s;&s;ia re&s;olved to obey and to ridicule the Chamber of Wetzlaar. He &s;ent, by a public diligence, a &s;erjeant of foot, who, at the fir&s;t He&s;&s;ian garri&s;on, delivered a paper to the captain of the guard, declaring him&s;elf to be the commander of the <HI>Arm&eacute;e Ex&eacute;cutrice,</HI> &s;et on foot by order of the Chamber; and the army con&s;i&s;ted of two corporals, who waited at the door! The Judges of Wetzlaar did not &s;hew, that they knew the di&s;re&s;pect, and were contented that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had reduced the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el to obedience.</P>
<P>To this Court &s;ubjects may make appeals from the orders of their immediate &s;overeigns, when the que&s;tion can be &s;hewn to have any general, or con&s;titutional tendency. Such a cau&s;e we heard of in Germany, and it &s;eemed likely to place the Chamber in &s;omewhat a delicate &s;ituation. The Elector of Treves had bani&s;hed a magi&s;trate, for having addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Cu&s;tine, during the inva&s;ion of the French, in 1792, and reque&s;ted to know whether he might remain on a part of his property, near their po&s;ts, and perform the duties of his office, as u&s;ual. The magi&s;trate appealed to Wetzlaar; admitted the facts charged; and &s;et forth, that, in this part of his conduct, he had exactly followed the example of the Chamber it&s;elf, who, though at a greater di&s;tance, had made a &s;imilar application.</P>

<P>Soon after leaving Oberlahn&s;tein, we pa&s;&s;ed the mouth of the Lahn, a &s;mall river, which de&s;cends from the mountains of Wette|ravia

on the right, and wa&s;hes &s;ilver and lead mines in its cour&s;e.

In the ruins of ca&s;tles and abandoned fortre&s;&s;es within the rece&s;&s;es of the&s;e wild mountains, &s;uch banditti took up their abode; and the&s;e are not fancied per|&s;onages, for, in the year 1273, an Elector of Mentz de&s;troyed the de&s;erted fortre&s;s of Rheinberg, becau&s;e it had been a rendezvous for them.</P>
<P>Towards &s;un-&s;et, the rain, which had fallen at intervals during the day, cea&s;ed; a fiery flu&s;h from the we&s;t was reflected on the water, and partially coloured the rocks.

Being con&s;idered as one of the keys of Germany towards France, the Governor takes the oaths not only to the Elector of Treves, but to the Emperor and the Empire. As it can be attacked but on one &s;ide, and that is not towards the Rhine, a blockade is more expected than a &s;iege; and there are &s;torehou&s;es in the rock for pre&s;erving a great quantity of provi&s;ions. The &s;upply of water has been provided for &s;o long &s;ince as the fifteenth century, when three years were pa&s;&s;ed in digging, with incredible labour, a well through the &s;olid rock.

this work, and that the rock was hewn to the depth of two hundred and eighty feet. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortre&s;s was con|firmed to the Elector of Treves by the treaty of We&s;tphalia in 1650.</P>
<P>In the morning, our boatmen cro&s;&s;ed the river from Coblentz, to pa&s;s under the walls of Ehrenbreit&s;tein, perhaps an e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ymp|tom of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The river is &s;till of noble breadth, and, after the junction with the Mo&s;elle, which immediately fronts the old palace, flows with great, but even rapidity. Its &s;hores are now le&s;s roman|tic, and more open; &s;preading on the left into the plains of Coblentz, and &s;welling on the right into retiring mountains.</P>

<HEAD>CONVERSATION RELATIVE TO FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>BUT our attention was withdrawn from the view, and our party in the cabin this day increa&s;ed, by a circum&s;tance, that occurred to our emigrant friend. Having found a large &s;abre, which he thought was of French manufacture, he was enquiring for the owner, when it was claimed by a gentleman, whom he recogni&s;ed to be an old friend, but with who&s;e e&s;cape from France he was unacquainted; &s;o that he had &s;uppo&s;ed, from his rank, he mu&s;t have fallen there. The meeting, on both &s;ides, was very affecting, and they &s;hed &s;ome tears, and embraced again and again, with all the ardour of French|men, before the &s;tranger was introduced to us, after which we had the plea&s;ure of his company as far as Cologne.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="326">
This gentleman, a Lieutenant-Colonel before the Revolution, had made his e&s;cape from France &s;o lately as May la&s;t, and his conver&s;a|tion of cour&s;e turned upon his late condition. There were in mo&s;t towns many per&s;ons who, like him&s;elf, were obnoxious for their principles, yet, being un&s;u&s;pected of active de&s;igns, and unreached by the private malice of Rober&s;pierre's agents, were &s;uffered to exi&s;t out of pri&s;on. They generally endeavoured to lodge in the hou&s;es of per&s;ons favourable to the Revolution; went to no public places; never vi&s;ited each other; and, when they met in the &s;treet, pa&s;&s;ed with an ha&s;ty or concealed &s;alutation. Their apartments were fre|quently &s;earched; and tho&s;e, who had hou&s;es, took care to have their cellars frequently dug for &s;altpetre.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the pro&s;pect of any political change, they had little hopes, and &s;till le&s;s of being able, by remaining in France, to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Combined Powers. They expected nothing but &s;ome chance of e&s;cape, which in general they would not attempt, without many probabilities in their favour, knowing the &s;ure con&s;e|quences of being di&s;covered. It was impo&s;&s;ible for them to pa&s;s by the common roads, being expo&s;ed to examination at every town, and by every patrol; but, in the day-time, they might venture upon tracts through fore&s;ts, and, at night, upon cultivated ground; a &s;ort of journey, to which they were tempted by the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of others in it, but which could not be performed, without experienced guides. It will be heard with a&s;toni&s;hment, that, notwith&s;tanding the many difficulties and dangers of &s;uch an employment, there were per&s;ons,
<PB N="319" REF="327">
who obtained a living by conducting others to the frontiers, without pa&s;&s;ing any town, village, or military po&s;t; who, having delivered one per&s;on, returned, with his recommendation, to another, and an offer to e&s;cort him for a certain &s;um. Our companion had waited &s;everal months for a guide, the per&s;on, whom he cho&s;e to tru&s;t, being under prior engagements, in all of which he was &s;ucce&s;sful. They &s;et out, each laden with his &s;hare of provi&s;ions, in the dre&s;s of pea&s;ants; and, without any other accident than that of being once &s;o near the patrols as to hear their conver&s;ation, arrived in the Electorate of Treves, from whence this gentleman had been to Ra&s;tadt, for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;enting him&s;elf to M. de Cond&eacute;.</P>
<P>It was remarkable that &s;ome of the&s;e guides did not &s;hare the principles of tho&s;e, whom they conducted; yet they were faithful to their engagements, and &s;eemed to gratify their humanity, as much as they &s;erved their intere&s;ts. Con&s;idering the many contrivances, which are behind almo&s;t every political tran&s;action, it &s;eems not im|probable, that the&s;e men were &s;ecretly encouraged by &s;ome of the rulers, who wi&s;hed to be di&s;encumbered from their enemies, without the guilt of a ma&s;&s;acre, or the unpopularity of appearing to a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>The attachment to the new principles &s;eemed to be increa&s;ed, when any circum&s;tances either of &s;ignal di&s;advantage, or &s;ucce&s;s, occurred in the cour&s;e of a campaign. The di&s;a&s;ters of an army, it was &s;aid, attracted &s;ympathy; their victories arou&s;ed pride. Such a change of manners and of the cour&s;e of education had taken place, that the
<PB N="320" REF="328">
ri&s;ing generation were all <HI>enrag&eacute;es</HI> in favour of the Revolution; of which the following was a remarkable in&s;tance: Two young ladies, the daughters of a baron, who had remained pa&s;&s;ively in the country, without promoting, or re&s;i&s;ting the Revolution, were then engaged in a law-&s;uit with their father, by which they demanded a mainte|nance, &s;eparate from him, <Q REND="inline">"he being either an Ari&s;tocrat, or a Neu|trali&s;t, with whom they did not choo&s;e to re&s;ide."</Q> They did not pretend to any other complaint, and, it was po&s;itively believed, had no other motive. Yet the&s;e ladies had been previou&s;ly educated with the nice&s;t care, by the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed in&s;tructors, and, in fact, with more expence than was &s;uitable to their father's income, hav|ing been intended for places at the Court. The children of the poorer cla&s;&s;es were equally changed by education, and tho&s;e of both &s;exes were proficients in all the Revolutionary &s;ongs and catechi&s;ms.</P>

<P>This conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed while we were floating through the vale of Ehrenbreit&s;tein, where the river, bending round the plains of Co|blentz, flows through open and richly cultivated banks, till it enters the valley of Andernach, where it is again enclo&s;ed among romantic rocks. The places, wa&s;hed by it in its pa&s;&s;age thither, are the villages of Neuralf, War&s;chheim, Nerenberg, Malter, the old ca&s;tle of Malter|berg, the village of Engus, the fine electoral palace of Schonbornu&s;t, the neat town and palace of Neuwied, and the chateau of Friedrich&s;tein,

<P>WAS occupied by Imperial troops; and, as we entered the gorge of its rocky pa&s;s, it was curious to ob&s;erve the appearances of modern mixed with tho&s;e of antient warfare; the &s;oldiers of Fran|cis the Second lying at the foot of the tower of Dru&s;us; their artil|lery and baggage waggons lining the &s;hore along the whole extent of the walls.</P>
<P>In this neighbourhood are three celebrated mineral &s;prings, of which one ri&s;es in the domain of the Carmelite mona&s;tery of Jonnie&s;|&s;tein; the &s;econd, called Ponterbrunnen, is &s;o bri&s;k and &s;pirited, that the labourers in the neighbouring fields declare it a remedy for fatigue as well as thir&s;t; and a third, called Heilbrunnen, has &s;o much fixed air, as to efferve&s;ce &s;lightly when mixed with wine.</P>
<P>The intere&s;ting valley of Andernach has been already de&s;cribed. Its &s;cenery, viewed now from the water, was neither &s;o beautiful, or &s;o &s;triking, as from the road, by which we had before pa&s;&s;ed. The elevation of the latter, though not great, enabled the eye to take a wider range, and to &s;ee mountains, now &s;creened by the nearer rocks of the &s;hore, which added greatly to the grandeur of the &s;cene. The river it&s;elf was then al&s;o a noble object, either expanding below, or winding in the di&s;tance; but, now that we were upon its level, its appearance lo&s;t much both in dignity and extent, and even the rocks
<PB N="323" REF="331">
on its margin &s;eemed le&s;s tremendous, when viewed from below. Something, however, &s;hould be allowed in this la&s;t re&s;pect to our having ju&s;t quitted wilder land&s;capes; for, though the banks of the Rhine, in its cour&s;e from Bingen to Coblentz, are le&s;s various and beautiful, than in its pa&s;&s;age between Andernach and Bonn, they are more grand and &s;ublime.</P>
<P>But the merits of the different &s;ituations for the view of river|&s;cenery have been noticed and contended for by the three per&s;ons mo&s;t authori&s;ed by their ta&s;te to decide upon them; of whom GRAY has left all his enthu&s;ia&s;m, and nearly all his &s;ublimity, to his two &s;ur|viving friends; &s;o that this opinion is to be under&s;tood only with re&s;pect to the &s;cenery of the Rhine, and does not pre&s;ume to mingle with the general que&s;tion between them. The Rhine now pa&s;&s;es by the village and ca&s;tle of Hammer&s;tein, which, with tho&s;e of Rheineck, were nearly laid wa&s;te by Louis the Fourteenth, the ca&s;tle of Argen|dorff and the towns of Lintz and Rheinmagen, all exhibiting &s;ymp|toms of decay, though Lintz is called a commercial town.</P>
<P>ROLAND'S Ca&s;tle appears &s;oon after, and, almo&s;t beneath it, the i&s;land, that bears Adelaide's convent, called Rolands Werth, or the Worth of Roland.</P>
<P>We were now again at the ba&s;e of the Seven Mountains, who&s;e &s;ummits had long a&s;pired in the di&s;tance, and, as we pa&s;&s;ed under the cliffs of Drakenfels, hailed the delightful plain of Goode&s;berg, though much of it was concealed by the high &s;edgy bank of the Rhine on the left. The &s;preading &s;kirts of the&s;e favourite mountains accom|panied
<PB N="324" REF="332">
us nearly to Bonn, and di&s;played all their various charms of form and colouring in this our farewell view of them.</P>
<P>The town and palace of Bonn extend with much dignity along the we&s;tern bank, where the Rhine makes a very bold &s;weep; one wing of the former overlooking the &s;hore, and the want of unifor|mity in the front, which is &s;een obliquely, being concealed by the garden groves; the many tall &s;pires of the great church ri&s;e over the roof of the palace, and appear to belong to the building.</P>
<P>After leaving Bonn, the &s;hores have little that is intere&s;ting, unle&s;s in the retro&s;pect of the Seven Mountains, with rich woodlands undu|lating at their feet; and when the&s;e, at length, di&s;appear, the Rhine lo&s;es for the re&s;t of its cour&s;e the wild and &s;ublime character, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it between Bingen and Bonn. The rich plain, which it waters between the latter place and Cologne, is &s;tudded, at every gentle a&s;cent, that bounds it, with abbeys and convents, mo&s;t of them appropriated to the maintenance of noble Chapters.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, the fir&s;t is the Ladies Chapter of Vilich, founded in the year 1190, by Megiegor, a Count and Prince of Guelderland, who endowed it richly, and made his own daughter the fir&s;t abbe&s;s; a lady, who had &s;uch excellent notions of di&s;cipline, that, when any nuns neglected to &s;ing in the choir, &s;he thought a heavy blow on the cheek the be&s;t means of re&s;toring their voices. This Chapter is one of the riche&s;t in Germany, and is peculiarly valuable to the nobility of this Electorate from its neighbourhood to Bonn, where many of the ladies pa&s;s great part of the year with their families. On the
<PB N="325" REF="333">
other &s;ide of the river is the Benedictine abbey of Siegberg, appro|priated al&s;o to nobles, and lying in the mid&s;t of its own domains, of which a &s;mall town, at the foot of its vineyards, is part. Admi&s;&s;ion into this &s;ociety is an affair of the mo&s;t &s;trict and ceremonious proof, as to the &s;ixteen quarterings in the arms of the candidate, each of which mu&s;t be unblemi&s;hed by any plebeian &s;ymptoms. Accompa|nied by his genealogy, the&s;e quarterings are expo&s;ed to view for &s;ix weeks and three days, before the election; and, as there is an ample income to be contended for, the candidates do not he&s;itate to impeach each others' claims by every means in their power. The prelate of this abbey writes him&s;elf Count of Guls, Strahlen and Neiderpleis, and has &s;ix provo&s;t&s;hips within his juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, and &s;imilar buildings, the Rhine pa&s;&s;es not le&s;s than twenty villages in its cour&s;e from Bonn to Cologne, a di&s;tance of pro|bably five-and-twenty Engli&s;h miles.</P>

<HEAD>COLOGNE</HEAD>
<P>NOW began to experience the inconveniences of its neighbourhood to the &s;eat of war, &s;ome of which had appeared at Bonn from the arrival of families, who could not be lodged in the for|mer place. We were no &s;ooner within the gates, than the throng of people and carriages in a city, which only a few weeks before was almo&s;t as &s;ilent as gloomy, convinced us we &s;hould not find a very ea&s;y welcome. The &s;entinels, when they made the u&s;ual enquiry as to our inn, a&s;&s;ured us, that there had been no lodgings at the Hotel de Prague for &s;everal days, and one of them followed us, to &s;ee what others we &s;hould find. Through many ob&s;tructions by mi|litary and other carriages, we, however, reached this inn, and were &s;oon convinced that there could be no room, the landlord &s;hewing us the chai&s;es in which &s;ome of his gue&s;ts &s;lept, and his billiard table already loaden with beds for others. There was &s;o much confu&s;ion meanwhile in the adjoining &s;quare, that, upon a &s;light a&s;&s;urance, we could have believed the French to be within a few miles of the city, and have taken refuge on the oppo&s;ite bank of the Rhine.</P>
<P>At length, our ho&s;t told us, that what he believed to be the wor&s;t room in the place was &s;till vacant, but might not be &s;o half an hour longer. We followed his man to it, in a di&s;tant part of the city, and &s;aw enough in our way of parties taking refre&s;hment in carriages, and
<PB N="327" REF="335">
gentlemen carrying their own baggage, to make us contented with a viler cabin than any per&s;on can have an idea of, who has not been out of England. The next morning we heard from the mi&s;tre&s;s of it how fortunately we had been &s;ituated, two or three families hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed the night in the open market-place, and great numbers in their carriages.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of this exce&s;&s;ive pre&s;&s;ure upon Cologne was the entry of the French into Bru&s;&s;els, their advances towards Liege, and the immediate pro&s;pect of the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht, all which had di&s;|peopled an immen&s;e tract of territory of its wealthier inhabitants, and driven them, together with the French emigrants, upon the confines of Holland and Germany. The Au&s;trian ho&s;pitals having been removed from Mae&s;tricht, five hundred waggons, laden with &s;ick and wound|ed, had pa&s;&s;ed through Cologne the day before. The carriages on the roads from Mae&s;tricht and Liege were almo&s;t as clo&s;e as in a proce&s;&s;ion, and at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> where the&s;e roads meet, there was an ob&s;truction for &s;ome hours. While we were at Cologne, another detachment of ho&s;pital waggons arrived, &s;ome hundreds of which we had the misfortune to &s;ee, for they pa&s;&s;ed before our window. They were all uncovered, &s;o that the emaciated figures and gha&s;tly counte|nances of the &s;oldiers, laid out upon &s;traw in each, were expo&s;ed to the rays of a burning &s;un, as well as to the fruitle&s;s pity of pa&s;&s;engers; and, as the carriages had no &s;prings, it &s;eemed as if the&s;e half-&s;acrificed victims to war would expire before they could be drawn over the rugged pavement of Cologne. Any per&s;on, who had once witne&s;&s;ed
<PB N="328" REF="336">
&s;uch a &s;ight, would know how to e&s;timate the glories of war, even though there &s;hould be a mercenary at every corner to in&s;ult his una|voidable feelings and the eternal &s;acredne&s;s of peace, with the &s;lander of di&s;affection to his country.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome thoughts of re&s;uming our cour&s;e by land from this place, but were now convinced, that it was impracticable, &s;eeing the number of po&s;t-hor&s;es, which were engaged, and judging of the crowds of travellers, that mu&s;t fill the inns on the road. Our water|men from Mentz were, however, not allowed to proceed lower, &s;o that we had to comply with the extortions of others, and to give nine louis for a boat from Cologne to Nimeguen. Having, not without &s;ome difficulty, obtained this, and &s;tored it with provi&s;ions, we again embarked on the Rhine, rejoicing that we were not, for a &s;econd night, to make part of the crowd on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Cologne, viewed from the river, appears with more of antient maje&s;ty than from any other point. Its quays, extending far along the bank, its lofty ramparts, &s;haded with old che&s;nuts, and crowned by many ma&s;&s;y towers, black with age; the old gateways opening to the Rhine, and the crowd of &s;teeples, overtopping all, give it a vene|rable and picture&s;que character. But, however thronged the city now was, the &s;hore without was &s;ilent and almo&s;t de&s;erted; the &s;en|tinels, watching at the gates and looking out from the ramparts, or a few women gliding beneath, wrapt in the nun-like &s;carf, &s;o melan|choly in its appearance and &s;o generally worn at Cologne, were nearly the only per&s;ons &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="337">
The &s;hores, though here flat, when compared with tho&s;e to the &s;outhward, are high enough to ob&s;truct the view of the di&s;tant mountains, that ri&s;e in the ea&s;t; in the &s;outh, the wild &s;ummits of tho&s;e near Bonn were yet vi&s;ible, but, after this faint glimp&s;e, we &s;aw them no more.</P>
<P>About two miles below Cologne, the we&s;t bank of the Rhine was covered with ho&s;pital waggons and with troops, removed from them, for the purpo&s;e of cro&s;&s;ing the river, to a man&s;ion, converted by the Elector into an ho&s;pital. About a mile lower, but on the oppo&s;ite bank, is Muhleim, a &s;mall town in the dominions of the Elector Palatine, which, in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, was likely to become a rival of Cologne. A per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tant mer|chants of the latter place drove them to Muhleim, where they erected a &s;taple, and began to trade with many advantages over the mother city; but the pu&s;illanimity of the Elector Palatine permitted them to &s;ink under the jealou&s;y of the Colone&s;e merchants; their engines for removing heavy goods from ve&s;&s;els to the &s;hore were ordered to be demoli&s;hed; and the commerce of the place has &s;ince con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in the exportation of grain.</P>
<P>The &s;hores are now le&s;s enlivened by villages than in the <HI>Rheingan</HI> and other di&s;tricts to the &s;outhward, where the cultivation and pro|duce of the vineyards af&s;ord, at lea&s;t, &s;o much employment, that &s;ix or &s;even little towns, each clu&s;tered round its church, are frequently vi&s;ible at once. The cour&s;e of the river being al&s;o wider and le&s;s rapid, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects is flower, and the eye is often
<PB N="330" REF="338">
wearied with the uniform lowne&s;s of the nearer country, where the antient ca&s;tle and the perched abbey, &s;o frequent in the Rheingau, &s;eldom appear. Corn lands, with a &s;light intermixture of wood, border the river from hence to Du&s;&s;eldorff, and the &s;tream flows, with an even force, through long reaches, &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by any variety of the country, or intervention of towns. Tho&s;e, which do occur, are called Stammel, Niel, Flietert, Mer|kenich, We&s;tdorff, Langelt, and Woringen; in which la&s;t place, the burge&s;&s;es of Cologne, at the latter end of the thirteenth century, &s;tood a &s;iege again&s;t their Archbi&s;hop, and, by a &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;t|ance, obtained the enjoyment of &s;ome commercial rights, here &s;o rare as to be called privileges. After Dormagen, a &s;mall town very &s;lightly provided with the means of benefiting it&s;elf by the river, we came oppo&s;ite to Zons, the fortifications of which are &s;o far pre&s;er|ved, as that the boatmen on the Rhine are required to &s;top before them and give an account of their cargoes.</P>
<P>We were li&s;tening to an old French &s;ong, and had almo&s;t for|gotten the chance of interruption from any abu&s;es of power, when the &s;teer&s;man called to us in a low, but eager voice, and enquired whether we would permit him to attempt pa&s;&s;ing the ca&s;tle, where, if we landed, we might probably be detained an hour, or, if the officer was at &s;upper, for the whole night. By the help of twilight and our &s;ilence, he thought it po&s;&s;ible to glide unnoticed under the oppo&s;ite bank, or that we &s;hould be in very little danger, if the &s;entinels &s;hould obey their order for firing upon all ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="331" REF="339">
that might attempt to pa&s;s. The in&s;olent tediou&s;ne&s;s of a German cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and the probable wretchedne&s;s of inns at &s;uch a place as this, determined us in favour of the man's propo&s;al; we were &s;ilent for a quarter of an hour; the men with-held their oars; and the watch|ful garri&s;on of Zons &s;aw us not, or did not think a boat of two tons burthen could be laden with an army for the conque&s;t of Germany.</P>
<P>The evening was not &s;o dark as entirely to deny the view of either &s;hore, while we continued to float between both, and to trace the fea|tures of three or four &s;mall towns upon them. Neu&s;s, being at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the river, was concealed; but we had an accurate remembrance of its hideou&s;ne&s;s, and, recognizing it for the model of many towns &s;ince &s;een, were plea&s;ed with a mode of travelling, which rendered us independent of them. The &s;ame mode, however, pre|vented us from vi&s;iting Du&s;&s;eldorff, which we did not reach, till after the &s;hutting of the gates; &s;o that, had we &s;tayed, we mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed the night in our boat on the out&s;ide, a &s;acrifice of too much time to be made, while an army was advancing to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. Being compelled to remain in the boat, we thought it de&s;irable to be, at the &s;ame time, proceeding with the &s;tream, and &s;uffered the &s;teer&s;|man to attempt pa&s;&s;ing another garri&s;on, by whom, as he &s;aid, we &s;hould otherwi&s;e be inevitably detained for the night. He did not effect this, without being noticed by the &s;entinels, who called and threatened to fire; but, as the boatmen a&s;&s;ured us this would &s;carcely be done, without leave from an officer, who might not be immediately at hand, we yielded to their method of pre&s;&s;ing forward as ha&s;tily as

po&s;&s;ible, and were pre&s;ently out of &s;ight of Du&s;&s;eldorff, of which we had &s;een only the walls and the exten&s;ive palace, ri&s;ing immediately above the water. In the next reach, the boatmen &s;topped to take breath, and then confe&s;&s;ed, that, though we had e&s;caped being de|tained, as they had &s;aid, they had &s;aved &s;ome florins due for tolls here and at Zons; which &s;aving was their motive for running the ri&s;k. Though we would not have encouraged &s;uch a purpo&s;e, had we been aware of it, &s;ince the neglect of an unju&s;t payment might produce an habitual omi&s;&s;ion of a ju&s;t one, it did not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much, in behalf of a toll on the Rhine, for which there is no other pretence and no other authority than the power to enforce it.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Du&s;&s;eldorff, we were a&s;&s;ured, was the le&s;s, becau&s;e the pictures of the celebrated gallery had been carried off to meet tho&s;e of Manheim, at Munich.</P>
<P>It was now dark for two or three hours, but we did not hear of any town or view worth waiting to ob&s;erve. The fir&s;t object in the dawn was the i&s;land of Kai&s;erwerth, on which there is a &s;mall town, twice be&s;ieged in the wars of Louis the Fourteenth, and now in the condition, to which military glory has reduced &s;o many others. One of the mines in the la&s;t &s;iege blew &s;o large a part of the walls over the i&s;land into the Rhine, that the navigation of the river was, for &s;ome time, ob&s;tructed by them. The dominion of this i&s;land, for which the Elector of Cologne and the Elector Palatine contended, was decided &s;o lately as 1768 by the authority of the Chamber of Wetzlaar, who &s;ummoned the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with his

troops, as the <HI>Arm&eacute;e ex&eacute;cutrice de l'Empire,</HI> and the Elector Palatine was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of his rival.</P>
<P>As the morning advanced, we reached the villages of Kreuzberg, Rheinam and Einingen; and, at five, &s;topped at Urdingen, a town on the we&s;t bank of the Rhine, at which the Elector of Cologne takes his northernmo&s;t toll, and a place of more commerce than we had expected to &s;ee &s;hort of Holland. Great part of this is in timber, which it adds to the floats annually &s;ent to that country; a &s;ort of expedition &s;o curious and u&s;eful, that we &s;hall make no apology for introducing the following account of it.</P>

<HEAD>TIMBER FLOATS ON THE RHINE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are formed chiefly at Andernach, but con&s;i&s;t of the fellings of almo&s;t every German fore&s;t, which, by &s;treams, or &s;hort land carriage, can be brought to the Rhine. Having pa&s;&s;ed the rocks of Bingen and the rapids of St. Goar in &s;mall detachments, the &s;everal rafts are compacted at &s;ome town not higher than Andernach, into one immen&s;e body, of which an idea may be formed from this li&s;t of dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The length is from 700 to 1000 feet; the breadth from 50 to 90; the depth, when manned with the whole crew, u&s;ually &s;even feet. The trees in the principal rafts are not le&s;s than 70 feet long, of which ten compo&s;e a ra&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="342">
On this &s;ort of floating i&s;land, five hundred labourers of different cla&s;&s;es are employed, maintained and lodged, during the whole voy|age; and a little &s;treet of deal huts is built upon it for their reception. The captain's dwelling and the kitchen are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other apartments by being &s;omewhat better built.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rafts, laid down in this &s;tructure, are called the founda|tion, and are always either of oak, or &s;ir-trees, bound together at their tops, and &s;trengthened with firs, fa&s;tened upon them cro&s;&s;ways by iron &s;pikes. When this foundation has been carefully compacted, the other rafts are laid upon it, the trees of each being bound together in the &s;ame manner, and each <HI>&s;tratum</HI> fa&s;tened to that beneath it. The &s;urface is rendered even; &s;torehou&s;es and other apartments are rai&s;ed; and the whole is again &s;trengthened by large ma&s;ts of oak.</P>
<P>Before the main body proceed &s;everal thin and narrow rafts, com|po&s;ed only of one floor of timbers, which, being held at a certain di&s;tance from the float by ma&s;ts of oak, are u&s;ed to give it direction and force, according to the efforts of the labourers upon them.</P>
<P>Behind it, are a great number of &s;mall boats, of which fifteen or &s;ixteen, guided by &s;even men each, are laden with anchors and cables; others contain articles of light rigging, and &s;ome are u&s;ed for me&s;&s;ages from this populous and important fleet to the towns, which it pa&s;&s;es. There are twelve &s;orts of cordage, each having a name u&s;ed only by the float-ma&s;ters; among the large&s;t are cables of four hun|dred yards long and eleven inches diameter. Iron chains are al&s;o u&s;ed in &s;everal parts of the &s;tructure.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="343">
The con&s;umption of provi&s;ions on board &s;uch a float is e&s;timated for each voyage at fifteen or twenty thou&s;and pounds of fre&s;h meat, between forty and fifty thou&s;and pounds of bread, ten or fifteen thou|&s;and pounds of chee&s;e, one thou&s;and or fifteen hundred pounds of butter, eight hundred or one thou&s;and pounds of dried meat, and five or &s;ix hundred tons of beer.</P>
<P>The apartments on the deck are, fir&s;t, that of the pilot, which is near one of the magazines, and, oppo&s;ite to it, that of the per&s;ons called ma&s;ters of the float: another cla&s;s, called ma&s;ters of the valets, have al&s;o their apartment; near it is that of the valets, and then that of the &s;ub-valets; after this are the cabins of the <HI>tyrolois,</HI> or la&s;t cla&s;s of per&s;ons, employed in the float, of whom eighty or an hundred &s;leep upon &s;traw in each, to the humber of more than four hundred in all. There is, la&s;tly, one large eating-room, in which the greater part of this crew dine at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The pilot, who conducts the fleet from Andernach to Du&s;&s;eldorff, quits it there, and another is engaged at the &s;ame &s;alary, that is, five hundred florins, or 42 l. ; each has his &s;ub-pilot, at nearly the &s;ame price. About twenty tolls are paid in the cour&s;e of the voyage, the amount of which varies with the &s;ize of the fleet and the e&s;timation of its value, in which latter re&s;pect the proprietors are &s;o much &s;ub|ject to the caprice of cu&s;tomhou&s;e officers, that the fir&s;t &s;ignal of their intention to depart is to collect all the&s;e gentlemen from the neigh|bourhood, and to give them a grand dinner on board. After this, the float is &s;ounded and mea&s;ured, and their demands upon the owners &s;ettled.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="344">
On the morning of departure, every labourer takes his po&s;t, the rowers on their benches, the guides of the leading rafts on theirs, and each boat's crew in its own ve&s;&s;el. The elde&s;t of the valet|ma&s;ters then makes the tour of the whole float, examines the labourers, pa&s;&s;es them in review, and di&s;mi&s;&s;es tho&s;e, who are unfit. He afterwards addre&s;&s;es them in a &s;hort &s;peech; recommends regu|larity and alertne&s;s; and repeats the terms of their engagement, that each &s;hall have five crowns and a half, be&s;ides provi&s;ions, for the ordinary voyage; that, in ca&s;e of delay by accident, they &s;hall work three days, gratis; but that, after that time, each &s;hall be paid at the rate of twelve creitzers, about four pence, per day.</P>
<P>After this, the labourers have a repa&s;t, and then, each being at his po&s;t, the pilot, who &s;tands on high near the rudder, takes off his hat and calls out, <Q REND="inline">"Let us all pray."</Q> In an in&s;tant there is the happy &s;pectacle of all the&s;e numbers on their knees, imploring a ble&s;&s;ing on their undertaking.</P>
<P>The anchors, which were fa&s;tened on the &s;hores, are now brought on board, the pilot gives a &s;ignal, and the rowers put the whole float in motion, while the crews of the &s;everal boats ply round it to facili|tate the departure.</P>
<P>Dort in Holland is the de&s;tination of all the&s;e floats, the &s;ale of one of which occupies &s;everal months, and frequently produces 350,000 florins, or more than 30,000 l.</P>

<P>HAS a neat market-place and &s;ome &s;ymptoms of greater comfort than are u&s;ual in the towns of the Electorate of Cologne; but it is &s;ubject to violent floods, &s;o much &s;o, that at the inn, which is, at lea&s;t, an hundred and fifty yards from the &s;hore, a bra&s;s plate, nailed upon the door of the parlour, relates, that the river had ri&s;en to that height; about five feet from the ground.</P>
<P>After re&s;ting here, five hours, we returned to our little bark, with the &s;pirits in&s;pired by favourable weather, and were &s;oon borne away on the ample current of the Rhine.</P>
<P>Large Dutch ve&s;&s;els, bound to Cologne, now frequently appeared, and refre&s;hed us once again with the &s;hew of neatne&s;s, indu&s;try and pro&s;perity. The boatmen learned, that &s;everal of the&s;e were from Rotterdam, laden with the effects of Flemi&s;h refugees, brought thi|ther from O&s;tend; and others were carrying military &s;tores for the u&s;e, as they &s;aid, of the Emperor. The ordinary trade of the Dutch with Germany, in tea, coffee, Engli&s;h cloths and Engli&s;h hardware, which we had heard at Mentz was &s;lackened by the expected ap|proach of armies, now &s;eemed to be exchanged for the conveyance of property from &s;cenes of actual di&s;tre&s;s to tho&s;e not likely to be long exempted from it.</P>
<P>A little beyond Urdingen, the town of Bodberg marks the north|ern

extremity of the long and narrow dominions of Cologne, once &s;o far connected with Holland, as that the Archbi&s;hop had juri&s;dic|tion over the Bi&s;hop of Holland, and the Chapter of Utrecht. But Philip the Second, before the States had re&s;i&s;ted his plundering, ob|tained of the Pope, that they &s;hould not be &s;ubject to any foreign &s;ee; and the Bi&s;hop had a re&s;idence a&s;&s;igned to him at Haerlem.</P>
<P>The Rhine is now bounded on the left by the country of Meurs; and, having, after a few miles, part of the Duchy of Cleves on the right, it becomes thus enclo&s;ed by the territories of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, under who&s;e dominion it rolls, till the States of Guelderland repo&s;e upon one bank, and, &s;oon after, tho&s;e of Utrecht, on the other. We were here, of cour&s;e, in the country of tolls; and our waterman could not promi&s;e how far we &s;hould proceed in the day, &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;timate the delays of the collectors. Meurs has no place, except &s;mall villages, near the river; but, at the com|mencement of the Duchy of Cleves, the influx of the Ruhr into the Rhine makes a &s;mall port, at which all ve&s;&s;els are obliged to &s;top, and pay for a Pru&s;&s;ian pa&s;s. Some Dutch barks, of probably one hundred and twenty tons burthen, we were a&s;&s;ured would not be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed for le&s;s than fifty ducats, or twenty guineas each. The town is called the Ruhort, and we had abundance of time to view it, for the Collector would not come to the boat, but ordered that we &s;hould walk up, and make our appearance before him.</P>
<P>It is a &s;mall place, rendered bu&s;y by a dock-yard for building ve&s;|&s;els to be employed on the Rhine, and has &s;omewhat of the fre&s;h

appearance, exhibited by &s;uch towns as &s;eem to be built for pre&s;ent u&s;e, rather than to &s;ub&s;i&s;t becau&s;e they have once been erected. In the dock, which opens to the Ruhr, two ve&s;&s;els of about &s;ixty tons each were nearly fini&s;hed, and with more capital, many might no doubt be built for the Dutch, timber and labour being here much cheaper than in Holland.</P>
<P>After the boatman had &s;atisfied the Collector, we re&s;umed our voyage, very well contented to have been detained only an hour. The woody heights of Cleves now broke the flat monotony of the ea&s;tern &s;hore, the antiquity of who&s;e fore&s;ts is commemorated by Tacitus in the name of <HI>Saltus Teutoburgen&s;is,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been bounded here by the town now called Dui&s;bourg:<Q>&mdash;"haud procul Teutoburgen&s;i &s;altu, in quo reliquiae Vari legionumque m&s;epultae dicebantur"&mdash;</Q><Q><L>"Unburied remain,</L>
<L>Inglorious on the plain."</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e fore&s;ts were al&s;o celebrated for their herds of wild hor&s;es; and the town of Dui&s;bourg, having been rendered an Univer&s;ity in 1655, is thus panegyrized by a German poet:<Q><L>Dis i&s;t die Deut&s;che Burg, vor lang&s;t gar hochgeehrt</L>
<L>Von vielen K&ouml;nig und auch Kai&s;erlichen Kronen:</L>
<L>Der &s;ch&ouml;ne Mu&s;enthron, wo kluge Leute wohnen;</L>

<L>Where learned folks live well on princely pay,</L>
<L>And commerce makes &s;o many Burghers gay.</L></Q></P>
<P>Of the commerce there were &s;till &s;ome &s;igns in half a dozen ve&s;&s;els, collected on the beach. Whether the Univer&s;ity al&s;o &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, or is any thing more than a free &s;chool, which is frequently called an Univer&s;ity in Germany, we did not learn.</P>

<HEAD>WESEL.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER five or &s;ix &s;mall towns, or villages, more, the Rhine reaches the well known fortified town and &s;tate pri&s;on of We&s;el; a place, not always unfavourable to freedom, for here RAPIN, driven from the di&s;trict now called La Vend&eacute;e in France, by Louis the Fourteenth's per&s;ecution of Prote&s;tants, retired to write his Hi&s;|tory; recollecting, perhaps, that it had before &s;heltered refugees from the tyranny of the Duke of Alva, and our &s;anguinary Mary.</P>
<P>The towers and citadel of We&s;el give it the appearance of a mili|tary place, and it is frequently &s;o mentioned; but the truth is, that the late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, with the &s;ame fear of his &s;ubjects, which was felt by Jo&s;eph the Second in Flanders, demoli&s;hed all
<PB N="341" REF="349">
the effectual works, except tho&s;e of the citadel; a policy not very injurious to the Monarch in this in&s;tance, but which, in Flanders, has &s;ubmitted the country to be twice over-run in three years, and has in fact been the mo&s;t deci&s;ive of pa&s;&s;ed events in their influence upon pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The reformed wor&s;hip is exerci&s;ed in the two principal churches, but the Catholics have two or three mona&s;teries, and there is a Chap|ter of Noble Ladies, of whom two thirds are Prote&s;tants, and one third Catholic; an arrangement which probably accounts for their having no &s;ettled and common re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to We&s;el is Burick, the fortifications of which remain, and are probably intended to &s;erve in&s;tead of the demoli&s;hed works of the former place, being connected with it by a flying-bridge over the Rhine. A little lower are the remains of the old chateau of Fur|&s;temberg, on a hill where the ladies of the noble Ci&s;tercian nunnery of Fur&s;temberg had once a delightful &s;eat, now de&s;erted for the &s;ociety of Xanten.</P>
<P>Xanten, the fir&s;t place at which we had &s;topped in Germany, and the la&s;t, for a long tract, which we had &s;een with plea&s;ure, Xanten, now di&s;tingui&s;hable, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the river, by its &s;pires, reminded us of the gay hopes we had formed on leaving it; with a new world &s;pread out before us, for curio&s;ity, and, as we thought, for admiration; yet did not render the remembrance of di&s;appoint|ment, as to the la&s;t re&s;pect, painful, for even the little information we had gained &s;eemed to be worth the labour of acquiring it.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="350">
The exchange of indefinite for exact ideas is for ever de&s;irable. Without this journey of eleven or twelve hundred miles we &s;hould have con&s;idered Germany, as its po&s;ition in maps and de&s;cription in books repre&s;ent it, to be important, powerful and pro&s;perous; or, even if it had been called wretched, the idea would have been indi|&s;tinct, and the a&s;&s;ertion, perhaps, not wholly credited. The greate&s;t and, as it is rea&s;onable to believe, the be&s;t part of Germany we have now &s;een, and, in whatever train of rea&s;oning it is noticed, have an opinion how it &s;hould be valued. Tho&s;e, who cannot gue&s;s at cau&s;es, may be &s;ure of effects; and having &s;een, that there is little individual pro&s;perity in Germany, little diffu&s;ion of intelligence, manners, or even of the means for comfort, few &s;ources of independence, or honourable wealth, and no examples of the poverty, in which there may be pride, it was not le&s;s perceptible, that there can be no general importance, no weight in the balance of u&s;eful, that is, peaceful power, and no place, but that of an in&s;trument, even in the de&s;perate exer|ci&s;es of politics.</P>
<P>A re&s;pect for the per&s;ons of learning, or thought, who live, as the impertinence of high and the ignorance of low &s;ociety forces them to live, in a &s;trict and fa&s;tidious retirement, cannot alter the general e&s;timation of the country, in any re&s;pect here con&s;idered; their conver&s;ation with each other has no influence upon the com|munity; their works cannot have a pre&s;ent, though they will have a general and a permanent effect. The humbler cla&s;&s;es, from whom pro&s;perity &s;hould re&s;ult in peace, and &s;trength in war, give little of
<PB N="343" REF="351">
either to Germany; and man is very &s;eldom negatively &s;tationed; when not u&s;eful to his fellow-creatures, he is generally &s;omewhat injurious. The &s;ub&s;tantial deba&s;ement of the German pea&s;antry, that is, their want of ordinary intelligence, re-acts upon the means that produced it, and, continuing their inferiority, continues many injurious effects upon the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>That Germany &s;hould be thus e&s;&s;entially humble, perhaps, none would have ventured to fore&s;ee. The materiali&s;t could not have found it in the climate. The politician might ha&s;tily expect it from the arbitrary character of the governments, but mu&s;t he&s;itate, when he recollects how France advanced in &s;cience and manufactures, under the dominion of Louis the Fourteenth, greatly more de&s;potic than the u&s;ual admini&s;trations in Germany. Perhaps, the only &s;olu|tion for this difference of effects from apparently &s;imilar cau&s;es is, that the greater extent of his territory, as well as the better opportu|nities of his &s;ubjects for commerce, enabled Louis to gratify his ta&s;te for &s;plendour, at the &s;ame time that they &s;hewed his ambition a means of indulgence, by increa&s;ing the means of his people. Ger|many, frittered into &s;everal &s;core of &s;overeignties, has no opulent power; no con&s;iderable income, remaining after the payment of its armies; few wealthy individuals. The Emperor, with fifty-&s;ix titles, does not gain a florin by his chief dignity; or Granvelle, the Mini&s;ter of Charles the Fifth, would have been contradicted when he &s;aid &s;o in the Chamber of Princes. The Elector Palatine is almo&s;t the only Prince, who&s;e revenue is not ab&s;orbed by political, military

and hou&s;ehold e&s;tabli&s;hments; and though, in an advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, or in opulent nations, what is called patronage is &s;eldom ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and mu&s;t, perhaps, be as injurious to the happine&s;s as it is to the dignity of tho&s;e who receive it, nothing is more certain than that there have been periods in the hi&s;tory of all countries, when the libe|rality of the Prince, or the more independent protection of beneficed in&s;titutions, was nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of curio&s;ity and know|ledge. At &s;uch times, a large expenditure, if directed by ta&s;te, or even by vanity, afforded a &s;low recompen&s;e for the aggre&s;&s;ions, that might &s;upport it, by &s;preading a de&s;ire of di&s;tinction for &s;ome intel|lectual accompli&s;hment, as the claim to notice from the court; and the improvement of mind circulated, by more general encourage|ment, till every town and village had its men of &s;cience. Thus it was that the de&s;poti&s;m of Louis the Fourteenth had a different effect from that of his contemporary German Princes, who, by no oppre&s;|&s;ions, could rai&s;e a &s;ufficient income, to make their own expenditure the involuntary means of improving the intellectual condition of their people.</P>
<P>From the neighbourhood of Xanten, in which we were induced thus to e&s;timate what had been gained, &s;ince we &s;aw it la&s;t, and from a &s;hore that gradually ri&s;es into the many woody heights around Cal|car and Cleves, the Rhine &s;peedily reaches Rees, a town on the right bank, built advantageou&s;ly at an angle, made by a flexu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the river to the left.</P>
<P>We landed to view this place, and were &s;oon per&s;uaded, by the
<PB N="345" REF="353">
Dutch-like cleanline&s;s and civility of the people at the inn, to remain there for the night, rather than to attempt reaching Emmerick.</P>
<P>Rees is near enough to Holland to have &s;ome of its advantages; and, whatever contempt it may be natural for Engli&s;h travellers, at the commencement of their tour, to feel for Dutch dullne&s;s and covet|ou&s;ne&s;s, nothing but &s;ome experience of Germany is nece&s;&s;ary to make them rejoice in a return to the neatne&s;s, the civility, the com|forts, quietne&s;s, and even the good humour and intelligence to be ea&s;ily found in Holland. Such, at lea&s;t, was the change, produced in our minds by a journey from Nimeguen to Friburg. The lower cla&s;&s;es of the Dutch, and it is the conduct of &s;uch cla&s;&s;es, that every where has the chief influence upon the comforts of others, are not only without the malignant fullenne&s;s of the Germans, and, therefore, ready to return you &s;ervices for money, but are al&s;o much &s;uperior to them in intelligence and docility. Frequent oppor|tunities of gain, and the habit of comparing them, &s;harpen intellects, which might otherwi&s;e never be exerci&s;ed. In a commercial coun|try, the humble&s;t per&s;ons have opportunities of profiting by their qualifications; they are, therefore, in &s;ome degree, prepared for bet|ter conditions, and do not feel that angry envy of others, which ari&s;es from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome irremediable di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Rees &s;peak both Dutch and German; and it was plea&s;ing to hear at the inn the &s;ulky <HI>yaw</HI> of the latter exchan|ged for the civil <HI>Yaw well, Mynheer,</HI> of the Dutch. The town is built chiefly of brick, like tho&s;e in Holland; the &s;treets light; the
<PB N="346" REF="354">
market-place &s;pacious, and the hou&s;es well pre&s;erved. It is of no great extent, but the &s;pace within the walls is filled, though this mu&s;t have been &s;ometimes partly cleared by the &s;ieges, to which Rees was &s;ubject in the war of Philip the Second upon the Dutch. A few emi|grants from Bru&s;&s;els and Mae&s;tricht were now &s;heltered in it; but there was no garri&s;on and no other &s;ymptom of its neighbourhood to the &s;cene of ho&s;tilities, than the arrival of a Pru&s;&s;ian commi&s;&s;ary to collect hay and corn. We were cheered by the re-appearance of pro&s;perity in a country, where it is &s;o &s;eldom to be &s;een, and pa&s;&s;ed a better evening in this little town, than in any other between Fri|burg and Holland.</P>
<P>In the morning, having no di&s;gu&s;t to impel us, we were &s;ome|what tardy in embarking; and the boatmen, who had found out the way of reviving our impatience, talked of the great di&s;tance of Hol|land, till they had us on board. Five or &s;ix well-looking villages pre&s;ently appear after leaving Rees, the next port to which is Em|merick, once an Han&s;eatic town, and &s;till a place of &s;ome dignity, from &s;pires and towers, but certainly not of much commerce, for we could not &s;ee more than two ve&s;&s;els on the beach.</P>
<P>This is the town, at which a Governor and General, appointed by Philip the Second, with probably half a dozen titles, a&s;&s;erting his ex|cellence, &s;erenity and honour, gave an in&s;tance of ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;carcely ever exceeded even by Philip him&s;elf. Approaching the place, which was then neutral, the inhabitants went out to him with an entreaty, that he would not &s;end troops into it, and, probably by

&s;omething more than entreaty, obtained his promi&s;e, that they &s;hould be &s;pared. In &s;pite of this promi&s;e, of the remon&s;trances of the inha|bitants, and of the repre&s;entations of a clergyman, that the Spani&s;h a&s;&s;urances of having engaged in the war chiefly for the intere&s;ts of the Catholic religion could not be credited, if acts, contrary to the precepts of all religion, were daily perpetrated; in &s;pite of the&s;e, Mendoza, the Spani&s;h commander, &s;ent in four hundred troops, but with another promi&s;e, that their number &s;hould not be increa&s;ed, and with this con&s;olation for the burge&s;&s;es, that the Spani&s;h Colonel of the detachment was directed to &s;wear in their pre&s;ence, to admit no more, even if they &s;hould be offered to him.</P>
<P>Mendoza had e&s;timated this man's heart by his own, and con&s;i|dered his oath only as a convenient delu&s;ion for preventing the re&s;i&s;t|ance of the inhabitants.

<P>Pa&s;&s;ing Emmerick with much plea&s;ure, we &s;peedily came to the point at which the Rhine, dividing it&s;elf into two &s;treams, lo&s;es its name immediately in the one, and pre&s;ently after in the other. Some writer has compared this merging to the voluntary &s;urrender of exertions and views, by which affectionate parents lo&s;e them&s;elves in their children. The &s;tream, which bends to the we&s;t, takes the name of the Waal; that, which flows in the general direction of the
<PB N="348" REF="356">
river, retains its name, for a few miles, when another &s;tream i&s;&s;ues to the northward, and takes that of the Y&s;&s;el. The old river is &s;till recognized, after this &s;eparation, and the town of Rhenen takes its name from it; but, about a mile lower, it yields to the denomination of the Leck, which, like that of the Waal, does not long enjoy its u&s;urped di&s;tinction. The Waal, or Wahl, being joined by the Maas, as the Dutch, or the Meu&s;e, as the French call it, near Bommel, takes the name of that river, and, &s;oon after, the Leck merges in their united &s;tream, which carries the title of the Maas by Rotterdam, Schiedam and Flaarding, into the German ocean.</P>
<P>We did not yield to this artificial di&s;tinction, &s;o far as to think our|&s;elves taking leave of the Rhine, or lo&s;ing the &s;tream, that had pre|&s;ented to us, at fir&s;t, features of the bolde&s;t grandeur, mingled with others of the &s;weete&s;t beauty, and then borne us &s;afely pa&s;t a &s;hore, pre&s;&s;ed by the ha&s;ty &s;teps of di&s;tre&s;s, as well as threatened by tho&s;e of ravage from a flying and a pur&s;uing army. Nor does the river change the character it has lately a&s;&s;umed; but &s;till pa&s;&s;es with an even, wide and forceful current between cultivated or pa&s;toral levels, bounded, at &s;ome di&s;tance, by gradual, woody a&s;cents.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e heights and woods, Cleves is vi&s;ible to the left, and tho&s;e, who &s;ee it only at this di&s;tance, may repeat the dictionary de&s;criptions of its grandeur and con&s;equence as a capital. Soon after, Schenckenkanze, a &s;mall fort, built on the point of the long i&s;land, round which the Rhine and the Waal &s;low, occurs; and then the

We were glad to &s;ee this commencement of the dominions of the United States, though the &s;hore oppo&s;ite to them was &s;till Pru&s;&s;ian; and, telling the boat|men, if they had occa&s;ion to &s;top at any town, to touch only upon the free bank, they humoured us &s;o far as to row out of the current for the &s;ake of approaching it; in &s;hort, we &s;tepped no more upon German land; and, within a few miles, were enveloped, on both &s;ides, by the pro&s;pering, abounding plains of the Dutch provinces. <HI>Italiam!

<P>Early in the afternoon, the lofty tower of the Belvidere, or pro|&s;pect-hou&s;e at Nimeguen, came in &s;ight; then the bright pinnacles of the public buildings, and the high, turf-coloured angles of the for|tifications. The town was thronged with fugitives from Flanders, but we found &s;ufficient accommodation, as before, at the inn in the market-place, and were not in a tone of &s;pirits to be fa&s;tidious about any thing, heightened as the appearance of pro&s;perity was to us by contra&s;t, and happy as even the refugees appeared to be at finding peace and &s;afety. The mall before the Prince of Orange's hou&s;e was filled with parties of them, as gay as if they had left their homes in Flanders but for an holiday excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>We were at the Belvidere till evening, lingering over the rich pro&s;pect of probably forty miles diameter, from Arnheim and Dui&s;|bourg
<PB N="350" REF="358">
in the north to Cleves and Guelders in the &s;outh, with an ea&s;t|ern view over half the fore&s;ts of Guelderland to tho&s;e of We&s;tphalia. Such an extent of green land&s;cape, richly varied with towns, villages and woods, &s;preading and gradually a&s;cending to the horizon, was now almo&s;t as novel to us, as it was placidly beautiful. On the ea&s;t, the blue mountainous lines of Germany broke in upon the repo&s;ing character of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>In the Waal below, two or three ve&s;&s;els bore the Emperor's flag, and were laden, as it was &s;aid, with &s;ome of his <HI>regalia</HI> from Flan|ders. Near them, &s;everal bilanders, the decks of which were covered with awnings, had attracted &s;pectators to the oppo&s;ite bank, for to that &s;ide only they were open; and the company in all were objects of curio&s;ity to the Dutch, being no le&s;s than the &s;i&s;terhood of &s;everal Flemi&s;h convents, in their proper dre&s;&s;es, and under the care of their re&s;pective abbe&s;&s;es. The&s;e ladies had been thus &s;ituated, for &s;everal days and nights, which they had pa&s;&s;ed on board their ve&s;&s;els. They were attended by their u&s;ual &s;ervants, and remained together, without going on &s;hore, being in expectation, as we were told, of invitations to &s;uitable re&s;idences in Germany; but it was then reported at Ni|meguen, that Prince Cobourg was re-advancing to Bru&s;&s;els, and the&s;e &s;ocieties had probably their misfortunes increa&s;ed by the arti|fices of a political rumour. We could not learn, as we wi&s;hed, that they had brought away many effects. Their plate it was needle&s;s to enquire about; the contributions of the preceding &s;pring had no doubt &s;wallowed up that.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="359">
Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our Cologne watermen, we embarked upon the Waal, the next day, in a public boat for Rotterdam; a neat &s;chuyt, well equipped and navigated, in which, for a few florins, you have the u&s;e of the cabin. Our voyage, from the want of wind, was &s;low enough to &s;hew as much as could be &s;een of the Waal; which, at Nimeguen, runs almo&s;t con&s;tantly downward, but is &s;oon met by the tide, and overcome, or, at lea&s;t, re&s;i&s;ted by it. The breadth, which varies but little above Bommel, is, to our recollection, not le&s;s than that of the Thames, at Fulham; the depth, during the begin|ning of the &s;ame &s;pace, is probably con&s;iderable, in the &s;tream, for, even upon the &s;hore, our dextrous old &s;teer&s;man found water enough to &s;weep the ru&s;hy bank at almo&s;t every tack, with a boat, drawing about five feet. The &s;igns of activity in commerce are a&s;toni&s;hing. A &s;mall hamlet, one cannot call any place in Holland contemptible, or mi&s;erable, a hamlet of a dozen hou&s;es has two or three ve&s;&s;els, of twenty tons each; a village has a herring boat for almo&s;t every hou&s;e, and a trading ve&s;&s;el for Rotterdam two or three times a week. Heavy, high rigged ve&s;&s;els, &s;carcely brea&s;ting the &s;tream, and fit only for river voyages, we frequently met; many of them carrying coals for the nearer part of Germany, &s;uch as we &s;aw on the banks between Rees and Nimeguen, and, with much plea&s;ure, recognized for &s;ymp|toms of neighbourhood to England.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t town from Nimeguen, on the right bank of the Waal, is Thiel, which we had only time to &s;ee was enclo&s;ed by modern fortifi|cations, and was not inferior in neatne&s;s to other Dutch towns, at lea&s;t
<PB N="352" REF="360">
not &s;o in one good &s;treet, which we were able to traver&s;e. A &s;and bank before the port has much le&s;&s;ened the trade of the place, which, in the tenth century, was con&s;iderable enough to be acknowledged by the Emperor Otto, in the grant of &s;everal privileges.</P>
<P>About a league lower, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Waal, or rather on the &s;mall i&s;land of Voorn, &s;tood formerly a fort, called Na&s;&s;au, which the French, in 1672, utterly de&s;troyed. Near its &s;ite, at the northern extremity of the i&s;land of Bommel, which lies between the Maas and the Waal, a fort, built by Cardinal Andrew of Au&s;tria, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, under the name of <HI>Fort St. Andr&eacute;.</HI> The founder, who built it upon the model of the citadel of Antwerp, had no other view than to command by it the town of Bommel; but, in the year 1600, Prince Maurice of Na&s;&s;au reduced the garri&s;on, after a &s;iege of five weeks, and it has &s;ince contributed to protect what it was rai&s;ed to de&s;troy, the independence of the Dutch commonwealth.</P>
<P>In the evening, we came oppo&s;ite to the town of Bommel, where we were put on &s;hore to pa&s;s the night and the next day, being Sun|day; the boat proceeded on the voyage for Rotterdam, but could not reach it before the next morning.</P>
<P>Bommel is a &s;mall town on the edge of the river, &s;urrounded by wood enough to make it remarkable in Holland; light, neat and pretty. The two principal &s;treets cro&s;s each other at right angles, and are without canals. Being at &s;ome di&s;tance from the general roads, it is ill provided with inns; but one of them has a delightful pro&s;pect, and there is no dirt, or other &s;ymptom of negligence within.
<PB N="353" REF="361">
The inhabitants are advanced enough in pro&s;perity and intelligent curio&s;ity to have two <HI>Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s,</HI> where they meet to read new publica|tions; a luxury, which may be found in almo&s;t every Dutch town. At the ends of the two principal &s;treets are gates; that towards the water between very old walls; tho&s;e on the land &s;ide modern and &s;tronger, with draw-bridges over a wide fo&s;&s;&eacute;, that nearly &s;urrounds the town.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of this ditch are high and broad embankments, well planted with trees, and &s;o &s;uitable to be u&s;ed as public walks, that we &s;uppo&s;ed them to have been rai&s;ed partly for that purpo&s;e, and partly as defences to the country again&s;t water. They are, however, greater curio&s;ities, having been thrown up by Prince Maurice in 1599, chiefly becau&s;e his garri&s;on of four thou&s;and foot and two thou&s;and hor&s;e were too numerous for the old works; and between the&s;e intrenchments was made what is thought to have been the fir&s;t attempt at a covered way, &s;ince improved into a regular part of forti|fications. This was during the ineffectual &s;iege of three weeks, in which Mendoza lo&s;t two thou&s;and men, Maurice having then a con|&s;tant communication with the oppo&s;ite bank of the Waal by means of two bridges of boats, one above, the other below the town.</P>
<P>Bommel was otherwi&s;e extremely important in the &s;truggle of the Dutch again&s;t Philip. It was once planned to have been delivered by treachery, but, that being di&s;covered, the Earl of Mansfeldt, Philip's commander, rai&s;ed the &s;iege. It adhered to the a&s;&s;embly at Dort, though the Earl of March, the commander of the fir&s;t armed force of
<PB N="354" REF="362">
the Flemings, had committed &s;uch violences in the town, that the Prince of Orange found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him to pri&s;on. In the campaign of 1606, when Prince Maurice adopted defen&s;ive operations, this was one of the extreme points of his line, which extended from hence to Schenck.</P>
<P>The natural hone&s;ty of mankind is on the &s;ide of the defen|&s;ive party, and it is, therefore, that in reading accounts of &s;ieges one is always on the &s;ide of the be&s;ieged. The Dutch, except when &s;ubject to &s;ome extraordinary influence, have been always defen&s;ive in their wars; from their fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing re&s;i&s;tance to Philip, to that again&s;t the petty attack, which Charles the Second incited the Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter to make, who had the coolne&s;s to tell Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE, that he had thought over the probabilities of his enterpri&s;e, and, if it failed, he &s;hould not care, for he could go into Italy and buy a Cardinal's cap; but that he had fir&s;t a mind to make &s;ome figure in the world. The territory of the United Provinces is &s;o &s;mall, that, in the&s;e wars, the whole Dutch Nation has been in little better condition, than that of a people, be&s;ieged in one great town; and Louis the Four|teenth, in the attempt, which Charles the Second's wicked &s;i&s;ter con|certed between the two Monarchs, &s;ent, for the fir&s;t time, to a whole people, a threat, &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;ometimes u&s;ed again&s;t a &s;ingle town. His declaration of the 24th of June, 1672, after boa&s;ting how his <Q REND="inline">"ju&s;t de&s;igns"</Q> and undertakings had pro&s;pered, &s;ince his arrival in the army, and how he would treat the Dutch, if,
<PB N="355" REF="363">
by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they would <Q REND="inline">"de&s;erve his great goodne&s;s,"</Q> thus proceeds:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On the contrary, all of whatever quality and condition, who &s;hall refu&s;e to comply with the&s;e offers, and &s;hall re&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty's forces, either by the inundation of their dyke, or otherwi&s;e, &s;hall be puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t rigour. At pre&s;ent, all ho&s;tilities &s;hall be u&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e, who oppo&s;e his Maje&s;ty's de&s;igns; and, when the ice &s;hall open a pa&s;&s;age on all &s;ides, his Maje&s;ty will not give any quarter to the inhabitants of &s;uch cities, but give order, that their goods be plundered and their hou&s;es burnt."</Q></P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant, in every country, to cheri&s;h the recollections, which make it a &s;pectacle for the mind as well as the eye, and no country is enriched by &s;o many as Holland, not even the We&s;t of England, where patrioti&s;m and gratitude hover in remembrance over the places, endeared by the &s;teps of our glorious WILLIAM.</P>
<P>Bommel is built on a broad projection of the i&s;land of the &s;ame name into the Waal, which thus flows nearly on two &s;ides of its walls, and mu&s;t be effectually commanded by them. But, though it is therefore important in a military view, and that the French were now &s;o near to Breda, as to induce families to fly from thence, whom we &s;aw at Bommel, yet the latter place was in no readine&s;s for defence. There was not a cannon upon the walls, or upon the antient outworks, which we mi&s;took for terraces, and not ten &s;oldiers in the place; a negligence, which was, however, immediately after remedied.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="364">
The Dutch tardine&s;s of exertion has been often blamed, and, in &s;uch in&s;tances, de&s;ervedly; but, as to the influence of this &s;paringne&s;s in their general &s;y&s;tem of politics and in former periods, a great deal more wit than truth has been circulated by politicians. The chief value of power is in the known po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Tho&s;e who are believed to have exerted it much, will be attacked, becau&s;e the exertion may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have exhau&s;ted the power. The nation, or the individual, that attempts to rectify every error and puni&s;h every trivial offence of others, may &s;oon lo&s;e, in worthle&s;s conte&s;ts, the &s;trength, that &s;hould be pre&s;erved for re&s;i&s;ting the mo&s;t po&s;itive and unequivocal attacks.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters have appeared in Holland, who could plan unnece&s;&s;ary conte&s;ts, and meditate the ba&s;ene&s;s, fal&s;ely called ambition, of put|ting the whole valour and wealth of a nation into exerci&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of enforcing whatever they may have once de&s;igned, or &s;aid; and, as there is, perhaps, no country in Europe, which cannot ju&s;tly allege &s;ome injury again&s;t another, they have exaggerated the importance of &s;uch injuries, for the purpo&s;e of impelling their own country, by aggravated anger, or fear, into precipitate ho&s;ti|lities. But the Dutch, accu&s;toming them&s;elves to as much vigilance, as confidence, have withheld encouragement from &s;uch artifices, and hence that general tardine&s;s in beginning wars, which every politi|cian, capable of an inflammatory declamation, thinks it wi&s;dom to ridicule.</P>
<P>We left Bommel at &s;even in the morning, in a &s;tout, decked &s;ea|boat,
<PB N="357" REF="365">
well rigged, and, as appeared, very dextrou&s;ly navigated. The wind was directly contrary, and there are &s;ometimes i&s;lands, &s;ome|times &s;hoals in the Waal, which narrowed the channel to four or five times the length of the ve&s;&s;el; yet there was not any failure in tacking, and the boom was frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ted to traver&s;e by the reeds of the bank, which it &s;wept. The company in the cabin were not very numerous, but there was among&s;t them at lea&s;t one lament|able group; the mini&s;ter of a Prote&s;tant church at Mae&s;tricht, an aged and decrepid gentleman, flying with his wife and two daughters from the approaching &s;iege of that place; him&s;elf laid on pillows upon the floor of the cabin; his daughters attending him; all neglect|ed, all victims to the glories of war.</P>
<P>The boat &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed Louven&s;tein, on the left bank of the Mae&s;e, a brick ca&s;tellated building, apparently about two centuries old, &s;ur|rounded by &s;ome modern works, which render it one of the de|fences of the river. Count Byland, the late commander of Breda, was then impri&s;oned in this fortre&s;s, which has been long u&s;ed for &s;tate purpo&s;es. Here tho&s;e friends of Barneveldt were confined, who derived from it, and left to their po&s;terity the name of the Lou|ven&s;tein party; and hence Grotius, who was of the number, made his e&s;cape, concealed in a trunk, which the &s;entinels had &s;o often &s;een filled with Arminian books, that his wife per&s;uaded them they carried nothing more than their u&s;ual cargo.</P>
<P>From Louven&s;tein, near which the Waal unites with the Mae&s;e, and a&s;&s;umes the name of that river, we &s;oon reached Gorcum, where
<PB N="358" REF="366">
the &s;hort &s;tay of the boat permitted us only to ob&s;erve the neatne&s;s of the town, and that the fortifications had the appearance of being &s;trong, though &s;mall, and &s;eemed to be in mo&s;t exact repair. This, indeed, is one of the forts chiefly relied upon by the province of Holland; for, in 1787, their States made Gorcum and Naarden the extreme points of their line of defence, and ordered a dyke to be thrown acro&s;s the Linge, which flows into the Mae&s;e at the former place, for the purpo&s;e of overflowing the &s;urrounding country.</P>
<P>The next town in the voyage is Dort, formerly one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Holland, and &s;till eminent for its wealth, though the trade is dimini&s;hed by that of Rotterdam. This is the town, which Dumourier &s;trove to reach, in the inva&s;ion of 1792, and forty thou|&s;and &s;tand of arms were found to have been collected there for him. Our boat pa&s;&s;ed before one quarter, in which the hou&s;es ri&s;e imme|diately over a broad bay of the Mae&s;e, with an air of uncommon gaiety and lightne&s;s; but the evenne&s;s of the town prevented us from &s;eeing more than the part directly neare&s;t.</P>
<P>In the bay was one of tho&s;e huge timber floats, the con&s;truction of which has been before de&s;cribed. It was crowded with vi&s;itors from the town; and the wooden huts upon it, being ornamented with flags, had the appearance of booths at a fair. Large as this was, it had been con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, &s;ince its arrival at Dort, and &s;everal hundreds of the workmen had departed.</P>
<P>A little further on, and within &s;ight of this joyous company, was the melancholy rever&s;e of nearly an hundred ladies, driven from
<PB N="359" REF="367">
&s;ome convent in Flanders, now re&s;iding, like tho&s;e near Nimeguen, in bilanders moored to the bank. Their ve&s;&s;els being open on the &s;ide towards the water, we caught as full a view of them as could be had, without di&s;re&s;pect; and &s;aw that they &s;till wore their conventual dre&s;&s;es, and were &s;eated, apparently according to their ages, at &s;ome &s;ort of needle-work. It might have been cen&s;ured, a few years &s;ince, that mi&s;takes, or deceptions, as to religious duties, &s;hould have driven them from the world; but it was certainly now only to be lamented, that any thing &s;hort of the gradual and peaceful progre&s;s of rea&s;on &s;hould have expelled them from their retirement.</P>
<P>We reached Rotterdam, in the evening, and &s;tayed there, the next day, to ob&s;erve whether the confidence of the Dutch in their dykes and fortre&s;&s;es was &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve their tranquillity in a place almo&s;t within hearing of the war, the French being then be&s;ieging Sluys. There was no perceptible &s;ymptom of agitation, or any dimi|nution of the ordinary means for increa&s;ing wealth. The per&s;ons, with whom we conver&s;ed, and they were not a few, &s;poke of the tran&s;actions of the campaign with almo&s;t as much calmne&s;s and curio|&s;ity, as if the&s;e had been pa&s;&s;ing in India. They could not &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that the French might reach the city; or, if they did, &s;eemed to rely upon the facility, with which their property could be removed by the canals through Leyden and Haerlem, to the &s;hore of the Zuy|der Zee, then acro&s;s it by &s;ailing barges, and then again by the canals as far as Groningen, whither the French would certainly not pene|trate. So valuable was water thought in Holland, not only as a means
<PB N="360" REF="368">
of opulence in peace, but of defence, or pre&s;ervative flight in war. An exce&s;&s;ive &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which is the vice of the Dutch, appeared &s;ometimes to prevent tho&s;e, who could fly, from thinking of their remaining countrymen.</P>
<P>An intention of di&s;pen&s;ing with the cu&s;tomary fair was the only circum&s;tance, which di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;ea&s;on from others at Rotter|dam, and that was imputed to the prudence of preventing any very numerous meetings of the populace.</P>
<P>About three weeks &s;ooner than was nece&s;&s;ary, for it was &s;o long before a convenient pa&s;&s;age occurred, we went from hence to Hel|voet&s;luys, and there remained, a fortnight, watching an inflexible north-we&s;terly wind, and li&s;tening to accounts but too truly certified of French frigates and privateers, almo&s;t unoppo&s;ed in tho&s;e latitudes. Lloyd's Li&s;t brought the names of five, or &s;even, French &s;hips, then known to be crui&s;ing in the north; and one packet was delayed in its voyage by the &s;ight of &s;everal Dutch ve&s;&s;els, &s;et on fire within a few leagues of <HI>Goree.</HI> The Dutch lamented, that the want of &s;eamen crippled the operations of their Admiralty Board: an Engli&s;hman, who was proud to deny, that any &s;uch want, or want in &s;uch a de|gree, exi&s;ted, as to his country, was reduced to &s;ilence and &s;hame, when it was enquired, Why, then, have the&s;e &s;eas been, for twelve months, thus expo&s;ed to the dominion of the French?</P>
<P>At length, a convoy arrived for a noble family, and we endea|voured to take the benefit of it by embarking in a packet, which &s;ailed at the &s;ame time; but the &s;loop of war was unable to pa&s;s over
<PB N="361" REF="369">
what are called the Flats, and our captain had re&s;olved to proceed without it, notwith&s;tanding the contrarieties of the wind, when, with much joy, we di&s;cerned a &s;mall boat, and knew it to be Engli&s;h by the &s;kilful impetuo&s;ity of the rowers. Having induced the people of the packet to make a &s;ignal, by paying them for the pa&s;&s;age to Har|wich, we were fortunately taken on board this boat, at the di&s;tance of about three leagues from Helvoet&s;luys, and &s;oon re-landed at that place; the packet proceeding on her voyage, which, &s;uppo&s;ing no interruption from the French ve&s;&s;els, was not likely to be made in le&s;s than three days. We rejoiced at the relea&s;e from fatigue and from fear, at lea&s;t, if not from danger; and, &s;eeing little probability of an immediate pa&s;&s;age, returned, the next day, to Rotterdam, with the hope of finding &s;ome neutral ve&s;&s;el, bound to an Engli&s;h port.</P>
<P>We were immediately gratified by the promi&s;e of an American captain to meet us with his ve&s;&s;el at Helvoet&s;luys, and, the next day, had a delightful voyage thither, in a hired yacht, partly by the Mae&s;e, and partly by channels inacce&s;&s;ible to large ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<P>THE Mae&s;e pre&s;ently brought us oppo&s;ite to this &s;mall port, the metropolis of the herring fi&s;hers; rendered intere&s;ting by the patient indu&s;try and u&s;eful courage of its inhabitants. We landed at it, but &s;aw only what was immediately open for ob&s;erva|tion. Like mo&s;t of the Dutch towns, on the banks of rivers, it is protected from floods by &s;tanding at the di&s;tance of three or four hundred yards from the &s;hore, and communicates with the &s;tream only by a narrow, but deep canal. The be&s;t &s;treet is built upon the quays of this channel, on which the herring boats depo&s;it their car|goes before the doors of the owners. We did not &s;ee more than fifty, a great number being then at &s;ea. Except the bu&s;ine&s;s in this &s;treet, and the &s;mell of herrings, which prevailed every where, there was nothing to &s;hew that we were in a place &s;upported &s;olely by the indu&s;try of fi&s;hermen; no neglected hou&s;es, no cottages, no dirty &s;treets, no inferiority, in point of neatne&s;s and brightne&s;s, to the other towns of Holland.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are remarkable for adhering to the dre&s;s, as well as the employments of their ance&s;tors; &s;o much &s;o, that their cloth|ing is mentioned in other towns as the repre&s;entation of the antient national dre&s;s, common throughout all the provinces two centuries
<PB N="363" REF="371">
&s;ince; and it is certain, that their appearance is exactly &s;uch as is delineated in pictures of that date.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Some miles further, we entered the old Mae&s;e, a channel in &s;everal parts very narrow, and evidently pre&s;erved by art, but in others nobly expan&s;ive, and filled almo&s;t to the level of the luxuriant pa&s;tures and groves that border it. In one part, where the antient &s;tream takes a circuitous cour&s;e, a canal has been cut, that &s;hortens the voyage, for light ve&s;&s;els, by &s;everal miles, and barks in one channel are &s;ometimes vi&s;ible from the other, their &s;ails &s;welling over fields, in which, at a di&s;tance, no water is di&s;cernible. Neat and &s;ub|&s;tantial farm-hou&s;es, with meadows &s;lanting from them to the river, frequently occurred; and there were more appearances of the careful labours, peculiar to the Dutch, than in the great Mae&s;e it&s;elf, the banks being occa&s;ionally &s;upported, like their dykes, by a compact ba&s;ket-work of flags and faggots.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing many &s;mall villages, or hamlets, we came, at &s;un-&s;et, to the large branch of the &s;ea, which &s;preads from William&s;tadt to Helvoet&s;luys and from thence to the German ocean. The former fortre&s;s was faintly vi&s;ible at a great di&s;tance over the water; and, while we were &s;train|ing our &s;ight towards it, there was proof enough of a nearne&s;s to the pre&s;ent theatre of war, the &s;ounds of the &s;iege of Sluys coming loudly and di&s;tinctly in the breeze. The characters of evening had fallen
<PB N="364" REF="372">
upon the &s;cene in mild and deep &s;olemnity; but the glories of nature were un&s;elt, while a dreadful e&s;timation of the mi&s;eries, produced at each return of the &s;ullen roar, pre&s;&s;ed almo&s;t exclu&s;ively upon the mind; con&s;iderations, which were &s;oon after prolonged by the me|lancholy view of &s;everal Engli&s;h tran&s;ports, filled with wounded &s;oldiers, who&s;e blythe mu&s;ic, now at the firing of the evening gun, was rendered painful by its contra&s;t to the truth of their conditions.</P>
<P>At Helvoet&s;luys, nothing was to be heard, but accounts, deri|ved from many re&s;pectable officers, on their way to England, of the unexampled difficulties borne, cheerfully borne, by the Briti&s;h army, within the la&s;t three months, and de&s;ervedly mentioned, not as complaints, but as proofs of their &s;irmne&s;s. There were, however, mingled with the&s;e, many reports as to the contrary conduct even of tho&s;e continental troops, which &s;till kept the field with us; of their tardine&s;s, their irregularity, of the readine&s;s with which they permit|ted the Briti&s;h to a&s;&s;ume all the dangers of attacks, and of their little co-operation even in the means of general re&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Brave Anglois! Brave Anglois!</HI> was the con&s;tant &s;hout of the&s;e troops, when they had recour&s;e to the Briti&s;h to regain the po&s;ts them&s;elves had ju&s;t lo&s;t, or to make &s;ome a&s;&s;ault, which they had refu&s;ed, or had attempted with ineffectual formality. They would then follow our troops, and, when an advantage was gained, &s;eemed to think they had &s;hare enough of the victory, if they were at hand to continue the &s;laughter of the retreating, and to engro&s;s all the plunder of the dead.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="373">
We were as glad to e&s;cape from &s;uch con&s;iderations, as from the crowded inns of Helvoet&s;luys, now little more convenient than &s;hips; and, the next morning, embarked on board the American ve&s;&s;el, then arrived from Rotterdam. A fair wind &s;oon wafted us out of &s;ight of the low coa&s;t of Holland; but we were afterwards becalmed, and car|ried by tides &s;o far towards the Flemi&s;h &s;hore as to have the firing before Sluys not only audible, but terribly loud. For part of three days, we remained within hearing of this noi&s;e; but did not, there|fore, think our&s;elves very di&s;tant from the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, knowing that the fire, at the preceding &s;iege of Nieuport, had been heard as far as the Downs; Nieuport, the wretched &s;cene of &s;o many ma&s;|&s;acres, and of di&s;tre&s;s, which, in Holland, had been forcibly de&s;cribed to us by eye-witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>So keenly, indeed, were the horrors of this place conceived by tho&s;e, who per&s;onally e&s;caped from them, that of the emigrants, re&s;cued by the intrepidity of our &s;eamen, many &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all joy at their own deliverance by lamentations for the fate of their brethren. One gentleman was no &s;ooner on board a &s;hip, then expo&s;ed to the batteries on &s;hore, than he climbed the &s;hrouds and remained aloft, notwith&s;tanding all entreaties, till a &s;evere wound obliged him to de&s;cend. Another, who had been &s;aved from the beach by a young &s;ailor, was unable to &s;wim &s;o far as the &s;hip; and the hone&s;t lad, having taken him upon his back, &s;truggled hard amid&s;t a &s;hower of balls to &s;ave both their lives. At length, he, too, began to falter;
<PB N="366" REF="374">
and the weakne&s;s of his efforts, not his complaints, &s;eemed to &s;hew his companion, that one, or both of them, mu&s;t peri&s;h: the latter nobly a&s;ked the lad, whether he could &s;ave his own life, if left to him&s;elf; and, receiving a reluctant reply, that probably he might do &s;o, but that he would &s;trive for both, the emigrant in&s;tantly plunged into the ocean, and was &s;een no more. The glorious &s;ailor reached his &s;hip, ju&s;t as he began again to fail, and was &s;aved.</P>
<P>The calm continued during the day, and the &s;un &s;et with uncom|mon grandeur among clouds of purple, red and gold, that, mingling with the &s;erene azure of the upper &s;ky, compo&s;ed a richne&s;s and har|mony of colouring which we never &s;aw &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. It was mo&s;t inter|e&s;ting to watch the progre&s;s of evening and its effect on the waters; &s;treaks of light &s;cattered among the dark we&s;tern clouds, after the &s;un had &s;et, and gleaming in long reflection on the &s;ea, while a grey ob&s;curity was drawing over the ea&s;t, as the vapours ro&s;e gradually from the ocean. The air was breathle&s;s; the tall &s;ails of the ve&s;&s;el were without motion, and her cour&s;e upon the deep &s;carcely per|ceptible; while, above, the planet Jupiter burned with &s;teady dignity, and threw a tremulous line of light on the &s;ea, who&s;e &s;urface flowed in &s;mooth wavele&s;s expan&s;e. Then, other planets appeared, and countle&s;s &s;tars &s;pangled the dark waters. Twilight now pervaded air and ocean, but the we&s;t was &s;till luminous, where one &s;olemn gleam of du&s;ky red edged the horizon, from under heavy vapours.</P>
<P>It was now that we fir&s;t di&s;covered &s;ome &s;ymptoms of Eng|land;
<PB N="367" REF="375">
the lighthou&s;e on the South-Foreland appeared like a dawn|ing &s;tar above the margin of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el made little progre&s;s during the night. With the earlie&s;t dawn of morning we were on deck, in the hope of &s;eeing the Engli&s;h coa&s;t; but the mi&s;ts veiled it from our view. A &s;pectacle, however, the mo&s;t grand in nature, repaid us for our di&s;appointment, and we found the circum&s;tances of a &s;un-ri&s;e at &s;ea, yet more intere&s;ting than tho&s;e of a &s;un-&s;et. The moon, bright and nearly at her meri|dian, &s;hed a &s;trong lu&s;tre on the ocean, and gleamed between the &s;ails upon the deck; but the dawn, beginning to glimmer, contended with her light, and, &s;oon touching the waters with a cold grey tint, di&s;covered them &s;preading all round to the va&s;t horizon. Not a &s;ound broke upon the &s;ilence, except the lulling one occa&s;ioned by the cour&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el through the waves, and now and then the drow&s;y &s;ong of the pilot, as he leaned on the helm; his &s;hadowy figure ju&s;t di&s;cerned, and that of a &s;ailor pacing near the head of the &s;hip with cro&s;&s;ed arms and a rolling &s;tep. The captain, wrapt in a &s;ea-coat, lay a&s;leep on the deck, wearied with the early watch. As the dawn &s;trengthened, it di&s;covered white &s;ails &s;tealing along the di&s;tance, and the flight of &s;ome &s;ea-fowls, as they uttered their &s;lender cry, and then, dropping upon the waves, &s;at floating on the &s;urface. Meanwhile, the light tints in the ea&s;t began to change, and the &s;kirts of a line of clouds below to a&s;&s;ume a hue of tawny red, which gradually became rich orange and purple. We could now per|ceive a long tract of the coa&s;t of France, like a dark &s;treak of vapour
<PB N="368" REF="376">
hovering in the &s;outh, and were &s;omewhat alarmed on finding our|&s;elves within view of the French &s;hore, while that of England was &s;till invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The moon-light faded fa&s;t from the waters, and &s;oon the long beams of the &s;un &s;hot their lines upwards through the clouds and into the clear blue &s;ky above, and all the &s;ea below glowed with fiery reflections, for a con&s;iderable time, before his di&s;k appeared. At length he ro&s;e from the waves, looking from under clouds of purple and gold; and as he &s;eemed to touch the water, a di&s;tant ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ed over his di&s;k, like a dark &s;peck.</P>

<P>We were &s;oon after cheered by the faintly &s;een coa&s;t of England, but at the &s;ame time di&s;covered, nearer to us on the &s;outh-we&s;t, the high blue headlands of Calais; and, more ea&s;tward, the town, with its large church and the &s;teeples of two others, &s;eated on the edge of the &s;ea. The woods, that fringe the &s;ummits of hills ri&s;ing over it, were ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed with gla&s;&s;es, as well as the national flag on the &s;teeple of the great church. As we pro|ceeded, Calais cliffs, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance we&s;tward of the town, lo&s;t their a&euml;rial blue, and &s;hewed an high front of chalky pre|cipice, overtopped by dark downs. Beyond, far to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and at the foot of a bold promontory, that &s;welled above all the neighbouring heights, our gla&s;&s;es gave us the towers and ramparts
<PB N="369" REF="377">
of Boulogne, &s;loping upward from the &s;hore, with its tall lighthou&s;e on a low point running out into the &s;ea; the whole appearing with con&s;iderable dignity and picture&s;que effect. The hills beyond were tamer, and &s;unk gradually away in the horizon. At length, the breeze wafting us more to the north, we di&s;criminated the bolder features of the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, and, about noon, found our&s;elves nearly in the middle of the channel, having Picardy on our left and Kent on the right, its white cliffs a&s;piring with great maje&s;ty over the flood. The &s;weeping bay of Dover, with all its chalky heights, &s;oon after opened. The town appeared low on the &s;hore within, and the ca&s;tle, with round and ma&s;&s;y towers, crowned the va&s;t rock, which, advancing into the &s;ea, formed the ea&s;tern point of the cre&s;cent, while Shake&s;peare's cliff, bolder &s;till and &s;ublime as the eter|nal name it bears, was the we&s;tern promontory of the bay. The height and grandeur of this cliff were particularly &s;triking, when a &s;hip was &s;een &s;ailing at its ba&s;e, dimini&s;hed by compari&s;on to an inch. From hence the cliffs towards Folk&s;tone, though &s;till broken and maje&s;tic, gradually decline. There are, perhaps, few pro&s;pects of &s;ea and &s;hore more animated and magni&s;icent than this. The va&s;t expan&s;e of water, the character of the cliffs, that guard the coa&s;t, the &s;hips of war and various merchantmen moored in the Downs, the lighter ve&s;&s;els &s;kimming along the channel, and the now di&s;tant &s;hore of France, with Calais glimmering faintly, and hint|ing of different modes of life and a new world, all the&s;e circum|&s;tances formed a &s;cene of pre-eminent combination, and led to in|tere&s;ting reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="378">
Our ve&s;&s;el was bound to Deal, and, leaving Dover and its cliffs on the &s;outh, we entered that noble bay, which the rich &s;hores of Kent open for the &s;ea. Gentle hills, &s;welling all round from the water, green with woods, or cultivation, and &s;peckled with towns and villages, with now and then the towers of an old fortre&s;s, offered a land&s;cape particularly cheering to eyes accu&s;tomed to the mono|tonous flatne&s;s of Dutch views. And we landed in England under impre&s;&s;ions of delight more varied and &s;trong than can be conceived, without referring to the joy of an e&s;cape from di&s;tricts where there was &s;carcely an home for the natives, and to the love of our own country, greatly enhanced by all that had been &s;een of others.</P>
<P>Between Deal and London, after being fir&s;t &s;truck by the &s;uperior appearance and manners of the people to tho&s;e of the countries we had been lately accu&s;tomed to, a contra&s;t too obvious as well as too often remarked to be again in&s;i&s;ted upon, but which made all the ordinary circum&s;tances of the journey &s;eem new and delightful, the different between the land&s;capes of England and Germany occurred forcibly to notice. The large &s;cale, in which every divi&s;ion of land appeared in Germany, the long corn grounds, the huge &s;tretches of hills, the va&s;t plains and the wide vallies could not but be beautifully oppo&s;ed by the varieties and undulations of Engli&s;h &s;urface, with gently &s;welling &s;lopes, rich in verdure, thick inclo&s;ures, woods, bowery hop grounds, &s;heltered man&s;ions, announcing the wealth, and &s;ub|&s;tantial farms, with neat villages, the comfort of the country. Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="371" REF="379">
land&s;cape may be compared to cabinet pictures, delicately beautiful and highly fini&s;hed; German &s;cenery to paintings for a ve&s;tibule, of bold outline and often &s;ublime, but coar&s;e and to be viewed with advantage only from a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Northward, beyond London, we may make one &s;top, after a country, not otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to be noticed, to mention Hard|wick, in Derby&s;hire, a &s;eat of the Duke of Devon&s;hire, once the re&s;idence of the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, to whom Elizabeth deputed the cu&s;tody of the unfortunate Mary. It &s;tands on an ea&s;y height, a few miles to the left of the road from Mansfield to Che&s;terfield, and is approached through &s;hady lanes, which conceal the view of it, till you are on the confines of the park. Three towers of hoary grey then ri&s;e with great maje&s;ty among old woods, and their &s;um|mits appear to be covered with the lightly &s;hivered fragments of battlements, which, however, are &s;oon di&s;covered to be perfectly carved open work, in which the letters E. S. frequently occur under a coronet, the initials, and the memorials of the vanity, of Elizabeth, Counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury, who built the pre&s;ent edifice. Its tall features, of a mo&s;t picture&s;que tint, were finely di&s;clo&s;ed between the luxuriant woods and over the lawns of the park, which, every now and then, let in a glimp&s;e of the Derby&s;hire hills. The &s;cenery reminded us of the exqui&s;ite de&s;criptions of Harewood,
<Q><L>The deep embowering &s;hades, that veil Elfrida;"</L></Q>
and tho&s;e of Hardwick once veiled a form as lovely as the ideal
<PB N="372" REF="380">
graces of the Poet, and con&s;pired to a fate more tragical than that, which Harewood witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In front of the great gates of the ca&s;tle court, the ground, adorned by old oaks, &s;uddenly &s;inks to a darkly &s;hadowed glade, and the view opens over the vale of Scar&s;dale, bounded by the wild moun|tains of the Peak. Immediately to the left of the pre&s;ent re&s;idence, &s;ome ruined features of the antient one, enwreathed with the rich dra|pery of ivy, give an intere&s;t to the &s;cene, which the later, but more hi&s;torical &s;tructure heightens and prolongs. We followed, not with|out emotion, the walk, which Mary had &s;o often trodden, to the fold|ing doors of the great hall, who&s;e lofty grandeur, aided by &s;ilence and &s;een under the influence of a lowering &s;ky, &s;uited the temper of the whole &s;cene. The tall windows, which half &s;ubdue the light they admit, ju&s;t allowed us to di&s;tingui&s;h the large figures in the tape&s;try, above the oak wain&s;coting, and &s;hewed a colonnade of oak &s;upporting a gallery along the bottom of the hall, with a pair of gigantic elk's horns flouri&s;hing between the windows oppo&s;ite to the entrance. The &s;cene of Mary's arrival and her feelings upon entering this &s;olemn &s;hade came involuntarily to the mind; the noi&s;e of hor&s;es' feet and many voices from the court; her proud yet gentle and melancholy look, as, led by my Lord Keeper, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly up the hall; his &s;omewhat ob&s;equious, yet jealous and vigilant air, while, awed by her dignity and beauty, he remembers the terrors of his own Queen; the &s;ilence and anxiety of her maids, and the bu&s;tle of the &s;urrounding attendants.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="381">
From the hall a &s;tair-ca&s;e a&s;cends to the gallery of a &s;mall chapel, in which the chairs and cu&s;hions, u&s;ed by Mary, &s;till remain, and proceeds to the fir&s;t &s;tory, where only one apartment bears memo|rials of her impri&s;onment, the bed, tape&s;try and chairs having been worked by her&s;elf. This tape&s;try is richly embo&s;&s;ed with emble|matic figures, each with its title worked above it, and, having been &s;crupulou&s;ly pre&s;erved, is &s;till entire and fre&s;h.</P>
<P>Over the chimney of an adjoining dining-room, to which, as well as to other apartments on this floor, &s;ome modern furniture has been added, is this motto carved in oak:
<Q><L>"There is only this: To fear God and keep his Commandments."</L></Q></P>
<P>So much le&s;s valuable was timber than workman&s;hip, when this man&s;ion was con&s;tructed, that, where the &s;tair-ca&s;es are not of &s;tone, they are formed of &s;olid oaken &s;teps, in&s;tead of planks; &s;uch is that from the &s;econd, or &s;tate &s;tory to the roof, whence, on clear days, York and Lincoln Cathedrals are &s;aid to be included in the exten|&s;ive pro&s;pect. This &s;econd floor is that, which gives its chief intere&s;t to the edifice. Nearly all the apartments of it were allotted to Mary; &s;ome of them for &s;tate purpo&s;es; and the furniture is known by other proofs, than its appearance, to remain as &s;he left it. The chief room, or that of audience, is of uncommon loftine&s;s, and &s;trikes by its grandeur, before the veneration and tenderne&s;s ari&s;e, which its antiquities, and the plainly told tale of the &s;ufferings they witne&s;&s;ed, excite.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="382">
The walls, which are covered to a con&s;iderable height with tape&s;try, are painted above with hi&s;torical groups. The chairs are of black velvet, nearly concealed by a rai&s;ed needlework of gold, &s;ilver and colours, that mingle with &s;urpri&s;ing richne&s;s, and remain in fre&s;h pre&s;erva|tion. The upper end of the room is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a lofty canopy of the &s;ame materials, and by &s;teps which &s;upport two chairs; &s;o that the Earl and Counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury probably enjoyed their own &s;tateline&s;s here, as well as a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ceremonies practi&s;ed before Mary. A carpeted table, in front of the canopy, was, perhaps, the de&s;k of Commi&s;&s;ioners, or Secretaries, who here recorded &s;ome of the proceedings concerning her; below which, the room breaks into a &s;pacious rece&s;s, where a few articles of furniture are depo&s;ited, not originally placed in it; a bed of &s;tate, u&s;ed by Mary, the cur|tains of gold ti&s;&s;ue, but in &s;o tattered a condition, that its orginal tex|ture can &s;carcely be perceived. This and the chairs, which accom|pany it, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been much earlier than Mary's time.</P>
<P>A &s;hort pa&s;&s;age leads from the &s;tate apartment to her own cham|ber, a &s;mall room, overlooked from the pa&s;&s;age by a window, which enabled her attendants to know, that &s;he was contriving no means of e&s;cape through the others into the court. The bed and chairs of this room are of black velvet, embroidered by her&s;elf; the toilet of gold ti&s;&s;ue; all more decayed than worn, and probably u&s;ed only towards the conclu&s;ion of her impri&s;onment here, when &s;he was removed from &s;ome better apartment, in which the antient bed, now in the &s;tate-room, had been placed. The date 1599 is once or twice
<PB N="375" REF="383">
in&s;cribed in this chamber; for no rea&s;on, that could relate to Mary, who was removed hence in 1584, and fell, by the often-blooded hands of Elizabeth, in 1587.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the apartments, di&s;tingui&s;hed by having been the re&s;i|dence of &s;o unhappy a per&s;onage. On the other &s;ide of the man&s;ion, a grand gallery occupies the length of the whole front, which is 165 feet, and contains many portraits, now placed carele&s;sly on chairs, or the floor; among&s;t them an head of Sir Thomas More, apparently very fine; heads of Henries the Fourth, Seventh and Eighth; a por|trait of Lady Jane Gray, meek and fair, before a harp&s;ichord, on which p&s;alm-book is opened; at the bottom of the gallery, Eliza|beth, &s;lyly proud and meanly violent; and, at the top, Mary, in black, taken a &s;hort time before her death, her countenance much faded, deeply marked by indignation and grief, and reduced as if to the &s;pectre of her&s;elf, frowning with &s;u&s;picion upon all who approached it; the black eyes looking out from their corners, thin lips, &s;omewhat aquiline no&s;e and beautiful chin.</P>
<P>What remains of the more antient building is a ruin, which, &s;tanding nearly on the brink of the glade, is a fine object from this. A few apartments, though approached with difficulty through the fragments of others, are &s;till almo&s;t entire, and the dimen&s;ions of that called the Giant's Chamber are remarkable for the beauty of their proportion.</P>

from the north-we&s;t brow of Brampton Moor, the va&s;t hills of Der|by&s;hire appear in wild and gha&s;tly &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Middleton, hewn out of the grey rocks, that impend over it, and &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from them, is worth notice for its very &s;mall and neat octagon church, built partly by brief and partly by a donation from the Duke of Devon&s;hire. The valley, or rather cha&s;m, at the entrance of which it &s;tands, is called Middleton Dale, and runs, for two miles, between perpendicular walls of rock, which have more the appearance of having been torn a&s;under by &s;ome convul&s;ive rent of the earth, than any we have el&s;ewhere &s;een. The &s;trata are horizontal, and the edges of each are often di&s;tinct and rounded; one of the characteri&s;tics of granite. Three grey rocks, re&s;embling ca&s;tles, project from the&s;e &s;olid walls, and, now and then, a lime-kiln, round like a ba&s;tion, half in|volves in &s;moke a figure, who, &s;tanding on the &s;ummit, looks the Witch of the Dale, on an edge of her cauldron, watching the work|ings of incantation.</P>
<P>The cha&s;m opened, at length, to a hill, whence wild moori&s;h mountains were &s;een on all &s;ides, &s;ome entirely covered with the dull purple of heath, others green, but without enclo&s;ures, except &s;ometimes a &s;tone wall, and the dark &s;ides of others marked only by the blue &s;moke of weeds, driven in circles near the ground.</P>
<P>Towards &s;un-&s;et, from a hill in Che&s;hire, we had a va&s;t view over part of that county and nearly all Lanca&s;hire, a &s;cene of fertile plains and gentle heights, till &s;ome broad and towering mountains, at an

immen&s;e di&s;tance, were but uncertainly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the clouds. Soon after, the cheerful populou&s;ne&s;s of the rich towns and villages in Lanca&s;hire &s;upplied objects for attention of a different character; Stockport fir&s;t, crowded with buildings and people, as much &s;o as &s;ome of the bu&s;ie&s;t quarters in London, with large blazing fires in every hou&s;e, by the light of which women were frequently &s;pinning, and manufacturers i&s;&s;uing from their work&s;hops and filling the &s;teep &s;treets, which the chai&s;e rolled down with dangerous rapidity; then an almo&s;t continued &s;treet of villages to Manche&s;ter, &s;ome miles before which the road was bu&s;y with pa&s;&s;engers and carriages, as well as bordered by hand&s;ome country hou&s;es; and, finally for this day, Manche&s;ter it&s;elf; a &s;econd London; enormous to tho&s;e, who have not &s;een the fir&s;t, almo&s;t tumultuous with bu&s;ine&s;s, and yet well proved to afford the nece&s;&s;ary peacefulne&s;s to &s;cience, letters and ta&s;te. And not only for it&s;elf may Manche&s;ter be an object of admiration, but for the contra&s;t of its u&s;eful profits to the wealth of a neighbour|ing place, immer&s;ed in the dreadful guilt of the Slave Trade, with the continuance of which to believe national pro&s;perity compatible, is to hope, that the actions of nations pa&s;s un&s;een before the Almighty, or to &s;uppo&s;e extenuation of crimes by increa&s;e of criminality, and that the eternal laws of right and truth, which &s;mite the wickedne&s;s of individuals, are too weak to &s;truggle with the accumulated and com|prehen&s;ive guilt of a national participation in robbery, cruelty and murder.</P>
<P>From Manche&s;ter to Lanca&s;ter the road leads through a plea&s;ant

and populous country, which ri&s;es gradually as it approaches the huge hills we had noticed in the di&s;tance from the brow of Che&s;hire, and who&s;e attitudes now re&s;embled tho&s;e of the Rheingau as &s;een from Mentz. From &s;ome moors on this &s;ide of Lanca&s;ter the pro&s;pects open very exten&s;ively over a rich tract fading into blue ridges; while, on the left, long lines of di&s;tant &s;ea appear, every now and then, over the dark woods of the &s;hore, with ve&s;&s;els &s;ailing as if on their &s;ummits. But the view from a hill de&s;cending to Lanca&s;ter is pre-eminent for grandeur, and comprehends an extent of &s;ea and land, and a union of the &s;ublime in both, which we have never &s;een equalled. In the green vale of the Lune below lies the town, &s;pread|ing up the &s;ide of a round hill overtopped by the old towers of the ca&s;tle and the church. Beyond, over a ridge of gentle heights, which bind the we&s;t &s;ide of the vale, the noble inlet of the &s;ea, that flows upon the Ulver&s;ton and Lanca&s;ter &s;ands, is &s;een at the feet of an amphi|theatre formed by nearly all the mountains of the Lakes; an exhibi|tion of alpine grandeur, both in form and colouring, which, with the extent of water below, compo&s;e a &s;cenery perhaps faintly rivalling that of the Lake of Geneva. To the &s;outh and we&s;t, the Iri&s;h Chan|nel fini&s;hes the view.</P>
<P>The antient town and ca&s;tle of Lanca&s;ter have been &s;o often and &s;o well de&s;cribed, that little remains to be &s;aid of them. To the lat|ter con&s;iderable additions are building in the Gothic &s;tyle, which, when time &s;hall have &s;haded the &s;tone, will harmonize well with the venerable towers and gate-hou&s;e of the old &s;tructure.

ri&s;ing over the leads of the ca&s;tle, called John o' Gaunt's Chair, the pro&s;pect is &s;till finer than from the terrace of the church-yard below. Overlooking the Lune and its green &s;lopes, the eye ranges to the bay of the &s;ea beyond, and to the Cumberland and Lanca&s;hire mountains. On an i&s;land near the extremity of the penin&s;ula of Low Furne&s;s, the double point of Peel Ca&s;tle &s;tarts up from the &s;ea, but is &s;o di&s;tant that it re&s;embles a forked rock. This penin&s;ula, which &s;eparates the bay of Ulver&s;ton from the Iri&s;h Channel, &s;wells gradually into a pointed mountain called Blackcomb, thirty miles from Lanca&s;ter, the fir&s;t in the amphitheatre, that binds the bay. Hence a range of lower, but more broken and forked &s;ummits, extends northward to the fells of High Furne&s;s, rolled behind each other, huge, towering and dark; then, higher &s;till, Langdale Pikes, with a confu&s;ion of other fells, that crown the head of Windermere and retire towards Ke&s;wick, who&s;e gigantic mountains, Helvelyn and Saddleback, are, however, &s;unk in di&s;tance below the horizon of the nearer ones. The top of Skiddaw may be di&s;cerned when the air is clear, but it is too far off to appear with dignity. From Windermere-Fells the heights &s;often towards the Vale of Lon&s;dale, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of which Ingleborough, a mountain in Craven, rears his rugged front, the loftie&s;t and mo&s;t maje&s;tic in the &s;cene. The nearer country, from this point of the land&s;cape, is inter&s;ected with cultivated hills, between which the Lune winds its bright but &s;hallow &s;tream, falling over a weir and pa&s;&s;ing under a very hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge at the entrance of the town, in its progre&s;s towards the &s;ea.

<P>The appearance of the northern Fells is ever changing with the weather and &s;hifting lights. Sometimes they re&s;emble tho&s;e evening clouds on the horizon, that catch the la&s;t gleams of the &s;un; at others, wrapt in dark mi&s;t, they are only faintly traced, and &s;eem like &s;tormy vapours ri&s;ing from the &s;ea. But in a bright day their appearance is beautiful; then, their grand outlines are di&s;tinctly drawn upon the &s;ky, a vi&s;ion of Alps; the rugged &s;ides are faintly marked with light and &s;hadow, with wood and rock, and here and there a clu&s;ter of white cottages, or farms and hamlets, gleam at their feet along the water's edge. Over the whole land&s;cape is then drawn a &s;oftening azure, or &s;ometimes a purple hue, exqui&s;itely lovely, while the &s;ea below reflects a brighter tint of blue.</P>

<HEAD>FROM LANCASTER TO KENDAL.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVING Lanca&s;ter, we wound along the &s;outhern brow of the vale of the Lune, which there &s;erpentizes among meadows, and is &s;oon after &s;hut up between &s;teep &s;hrubby banks. From the heights we had &s;ome fine retro&s;pects of Lanca&s;ter and the di&s;tant &s;ea; but, about three miles from the town, the hills open forward to a view as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by the notice of Mr. GRAY, as by its own charms. We here looked down over a woody and finely broken fore-ground upon the Lune and the vale of Lon&s;dale, undulating in richly cultivated &s;lopes, with Ingleborough, for the back-ground, bearing its bold promontory on high, the very crown and paragon of the land&s;cape. To the we&s;t, the vale winds from &s;ight among &s;moother hills; and the gracefully falling line of a moun|tain, on the left, forms, with the wooded heights, on the right, a kind of frame for the di&s;tant picture.</P>
<P>The road now turned into the &s;weetly retired vale of Caton, and by the village church-yard, in which there is not a &s;ingle grave|&s;tone, to Hornby, a &s;mall &s;traggling town, delightfully &s;eated near the entrance of the vale of Lon&s;dale. Its thin toppling ca&s;tle is &s;een among wood, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, with a dark hill ri&s;ing over it. What remains of the old edifice is a &s;quare grey building, with a &s;lender watch-tower, ri&s;ing in one corner, like a feather in a hat,
<PB N="382" REF="390">
which joins the modern man&s;ion of white &s;tone, and gives it a &s;ingu|lar appearance, by &s;eeming to &s;tart from the centre of its roof.</P>
<P>In front, a &s;teep lawn de&s;cends between avenues of old wood, and the park extends along the &s;kirts of the craggy hill, that towers above. At its foot, is a good &s;tone bridge over the Wenning, now &s;hrunk in its pebbly bed, and, further on, near the ca&s;tle, the church, &s;hewing a hand&s;ome octagonal tower, crowned with battlements. The road then becomes extremely intere&s;ting, and, at Melling, a village on a brow &s;ome miles further, the view opens over the whole vale of Lon&s;dale. The eye now pa&s;&s;es, beneath the arching foliage of &s;ome trees in the fore-ground, to the &s;weeping valley, where mea|dows of the mo&s;t vivid green and dark woods, with white cottages and villages peeping from among them, mingle with &s;urpri&s;ing rich|ne&s;s, and undulate from either bank of the Lune to the feet of hills. Ingleborough, ri&s;ing from elegantly &s;welling ground, over|looked this enchanting vale, on the right, clouds rolling along its broken top, like &s;moke from a cauldron, and its hoary tint forming a boundary to the &s;oft verdure and rich woodlands of the &s;lopes, at its feet. The per&s;pective was terminated by the tall peeping heads of the We&s;tmoreland fells, the nearer ones tinged with fainte&s;t purple, the more di&s;tant with light azure; and this is the general boundary to a &s;cene, in the mid&s;t of which, enclo&s;ed between nearer and lower hills, lies the vale of Lon&s;dale, of a character mild, delicate and repo&s;ing, like the countenance of a Madona.</P>
<P>De&s;cending Melling brow, and winding among the perpetually-<PB N="383" REF="391">changing
&s;cenery of the valley, we approached Ingleborough; and it was intere&s;ting to ob&s;erve the lines of its bolder features gradually &s;trengthening, and the &s;hadowy markings of its minuter ones becom|ing more di&s;tinct, as we advanced. Rock and grey crags looked out from the heath, on every &s;ide; but its form on each was very dif|ferent. Towards Lon&s;dale, the mountain is bold and maje&s;tic, ri&s;ing in abrupt and broken precipices, and often impending, till, at the &s;ummit, it &s;uddenly becomes flat, and is level for nearly a mile, whence it de&s;cends, in a long gradual ridge, to Craven in York&s;hire. In &s;ummer, &s;ome fe&s;tivities are annually celebrated on this top, and the country people, as they <Q REND="inline">"drink the fre&s;hne&s;s of the mountain breeze<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Barbauld.</NOTE>,"</Q> look over the wild moorlands of York&s;hire, the rich vales of Lanca&s;hire, and to the &s;ublime mountains of We&s;tmoreland.</P>
<P>Cro&s;&s;ing a &s;mall bridge, we turned from Ingleborough, and pa&s;&s;ed very near the antient walls of Thirlham Ca&s;tle, little of which is now remaining. The ruin is on a green broken knoll, one &s;ide of which is darkened with bru&s;h-wood and dwarf-oak. Cattle were repo&s;ing in the &s;hade, on the bank of a rivulet, that rippled through what was formerly the ca&s;tle ditch. A few old trees waved over what was once a tower, now covered with ivy.</P>
<P>Some miles further, we cro&s;&s;ed the Leck, a &s;hrunk and de&s;olate &s;tream, nearly choked with pebbles, winding in a deep rocky glen, where trees and &s;hrubs marked the winter boundary of the waters. Our road, mounting a green eminence of the oppo&s;ite bank, on
<PB N="384" REF="392">
which &s;tands Overborough, the hand&s;ome modern man&s;ion of Mr. FENWICK, wound between plantations and meadows, painted with yellow and purple flowers, like tho&s;e of &s;pring. As we pa&s;&s;ed through their gentle &s;lopes, we had, now and then, &s;weet views between the foliage, on the left, into the vale of Lon&s;dale, now con|tracting in its cour&s;e, and winding into ruder &s;cenery. Among the&s;e catches, the be&s;t picture was, perhaps, where the white town of Kirby Lon&s;dale &s;helves along the oppo&s;ite bank, having rough heathy hills immediately above it, and, below, a venerable Gothic bridge over the Lune, ri&s;ing in tall arches, like an antient aqueduct; its grey tint agreeing well with the &s;ilvery lightne&s;s of the water and the green &s;hades, that flouri&s;hed from the &s;teep margin over the abutments.</P>
<P>The view from this bridge, too, was beautiful. The river, foam|ing below among ma&s;&s;es of dark rock, variegated with light tints of grey, as if touched by the painter's pencil, withdrew towards the &s;outh in a &s;traight channel, with the woods of Overborough on the left. The vale, dilating, opened a long per&s;pective to Ingleborough and many blue mountains more di&s;tant, with all the little villages we had pa&s;&s;ed, glittering on the intervening eminences. The colouring of &s;ome low hills, on the right, was particularly beautiful, long &s;hades of wood being overtopped with brown heath, while, below, meadows of &s;oft verdure fell gently towards the river bank.</P>
<P>Kirby Lon&s;dale, a neat little town, commanding the whole vale, is on the we&s;tern &s;teep. We &s;taid two hours at it, gratified by wit|ne&s;&s;ing, at the fir&s;t inn we reached, the abundance of the country
<PB N="385" REF="393">
and the goodwill of the people. In times, when the prices of nece&s;|&s;ary articles are increa&s;ing with the ta&s;te for all unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;play, in&s;tances of cheapne&s;s may be to per&s;ons of &s;mall incomes &s;omething more than mere phy&s;ical trea&s;ures; they have a moral value in con|tributing to independence of mind.</P>
<P>Here we had an early and, as it afterwards appeared, a very exag|gerated &s;pecimen of the dialect of the country. A woman talked, for five minutes, again&s;t our window, of who&s;e conver&s;ation we could under&s;tand &s;carcely a word. Soon after, a boy replied to a que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I do na ken,</HI>"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"<HI>gang</HI>"</Q> was pre&s;ently the common word for <HI>go;</HI> &s;ymptoms of nearne&s;s to a country, which we did not approach, without delighting to enumerate the in&s;tances of genius and worth, that adorn it.</P>
<P>Leaving Kirby-Lon&s;dale by the Kendal road, we mounted a &s;teep hill, and, looking back from its &s;ummit upon the whole vale of Lon&s;dale, perceived our&s;elves to be in the mid-way between beauty and de&s;olation, &s;o enchanting was the retro&s;pect and &s;o wild and dreary the pro&s;pect. From the neighbourhood of Caton to Kirby the ride was &s;uperior, for elegant beauty, to any we had pa&s;&s;ed; this from Kirby to Kendal is of a character di&s;tinctly oppo&s;ite. After lo&s;ing &s;ight of the vale, the road lies, for nearly the whole di&s;tance, over moors and perpetually &s;ucceeding hills, thinly covered with dark purple heath flowers, of which the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;eemed black. The drearine&s;s of the &s;cene was increa&s;ed by a heavy rain and by
<PB N="386" REF="394">
the flowne&s;s of our progre&s;s, jo&s;tling among&s;t coal carts, for ten miles of rugged ground. The views over the We&s;tmoreland moun|tains were, however, not entirely ob&s;cured; their va&s;t ridges were vi&s;ible in the horizon to the north and we&s;t, line over line, fre|quently in five or &s;ix ranges. Sometimes the inter&s;ecting moun|tains opened to others beyond, that fell in deep and abrupt preci|pices, their profiles drawing towards a point below and &s;eeming to &s;ink in a bottomle&s;s aby&s;s.</P>
<P>On our way over the&s;e wilds, parts of which are called Endmoor and Cowbrows, we overtook only long trains of coal carts, and, after ten miles of bleak mountain road, began to de&s;ire a temporary home, &s;omewhat &s;ooner than we perceived Kendal, white-&s;moking in the dark vale. As we approached, the outlines of its ruinous ca&s;tle were ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hable through the gloom, &s;cattered in ma&s;&s;es over the top of a &s;mall round hill, on the right. At the entrance of the town, the river Kent da&s;hed in foam down a weir; beyond it, on a green &s;lope, the gothic tower of the church was half hid by a clu&s;ter of dark trees; gray fells glimmered in the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>We were lodged at another excellent inn, and, the next morn|ing, walked over the town, which has an air of trade mingled with that of antiquity. Its hi&s;tory has been given in other places, and we are not able to di&s;cu&s;s the doubt, whether it was the Roman <HI>Broca|nonacio,</HI> or not. The manufacture of cloth, which our &s;tatute books
<PB N="387" REF="395">
te&s;tify to have exi&s;ted as early as the reign, in which <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI> is made to allude to it, appears to be &s;till in vigour, for the town is &s;urrounded, towards the river, with dying grounds. We &s;aw, how|ever, no &s;hades of <Q REND="inline">"Kendal green,"</Q> or, indeed, any but bright &s;carlet.</P>
<P>The church is remarkable for three chapels, memorials of the an|tient dignity of three neighbouring families, the Bellinghams, Strick|lands and Parrs. The&s;e are inclo&s;ures, on each &s;ide of the altar, differing from pews chiefly in being large enough to contain tombs. Mr. Gray noticed them minutely in the year 1769. They were then probably entire; but the wain&s;cot or railing, which divided the chapel of the Parrs from the ai&s;le, is now gone. Of two &s;tone tombs in it one is inclo&s;ed with modern railing, and there are many remnants of painted arms on the adjoining windows. The chapel of the Stricklands, which is between this and the altar, is &s;eparated from the church ai&s;le by a &s;olid wain&s;cot, to the height of four feet, and after that by a wooden railing with broken fillagree ornaments. That of the Bellinghams contains an antient tomb, of which the bra&s;s plates, that bore in&s;criptions and arms, are now gone, but &s;ome traces of the latter remain in plai&s;tered &s;tone at the &s;ide. Over it, are the fragments of an helmet, and, in the roof, tho&s;e of armorial bearings, carved in wood. On a pillar, near this, is an in&s;crip|tion, almo&s;t obliterated, in which the following words may yet be traced:<Q><PB N="388" REF="396">

<P>The Saxon has been &s;o &s;trongly engrafted on our language, that, in reading old in&s;criptions, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, which are likely to have been &s;pelt, according to the pronunciation, one is frequently re|minded by antient Engli&s;h words of the modern German &s;ynonyms. A German of the pre&s;ent day would &s;ay for eleven, eilf, pronounced long like eilve, and for five, funf, pronounced like fuynf.</P>
<P>Over the chief &s;eat in the old pew of the Bellinghams is a bra&s;s plate, engraved with the figure of a man in armour, and, on each &s;ide of it, a bra&s;s e&s;cutcheon, of which that on the right has a motto thus &s;pelled <HI>Ains. y L'e&s;t.</HI> Under the figure is the following in&s;crip|tion, al&s;o cut in bra&s;s:<Q>Heer lyeth the bodye of Alan Bellingham e&s;quier <LB>who maryed Catheryan daughter of Anthonye <LB>Ducket e&s;quier by whom he had no children <LB>after who&s;e decea&s;e he maryed Dorothie daughter <LB>of Thomas Sanford e&s;quier of whom he had &mdash; <LB>&s;onnes &amp; eight daughters, of which five &s;onnes &amp; 7 <LB>daughters with the &s;aid Dorothie ar yeat lyving, he <LB>was thre&s;core and one yares of age &amp; dyed y^e 7 of Maye <LB>Ao dni 1577.</Q></P>

The correctne&s;s of in&s;erting the unpronounced con&s;onants in the words Eight and Daughters, notwith&s;tanding the varieties of the other orthography in this in&s;cription, is a proof of the univer&s;ality of the Saxon mode of &s;pelling, with great abundance and even wa&s;te of letters; a mode, which is &s;o incorporated with our language, that tho&s;e, who are for di&s;pen&s;ing with it in &s;ome in&s;tances, as in the final k in <Q REND="inline">"publick"</Q> and other words, &s;hould con&s;ider what a general change they have to effect, or what partial incongruities they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>Kendal is built on the lower &s;teeps of a hill, that towers over the principal &s;treet, and bears on one of its brows a te&s;timony to the independence of the inhabitants, an obeli&s;k dedicated to liberty and to the memory of the Revolution in 1688. At a time, when the memory of that revolution is reviled, and the prai&s;es of liberty it&s;elf endea|voured to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the artifice of imputing to it the crimes of anarchy, it was impo&s;&s;ible to omit any act of veneration to the ble&s;&s;ings of this event. Being thus led to a&s;cend the hill, we had a view of the country, over which it pre&s;ides; a &s;cene &s;imple, great and free as the &s;pirit revered amid&s;t it.</P>

<HEAD>FROM KENDAL TO BAMPTON AND HAWES WATER.</HEAD>
<P>OF two roads from Kendal to Bampton one is through Long Sleddale, the other over Shapfell, the king of the We&s;tmoreland mountains; of which routes the la&s;t is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting for &s;imple &s;ublimity, leading through the heart of the wilde&s;t tracts and open|ing to &s;uch va&s;t highland &s;cenery as even Derby&s;hire cannot &s;hew. We left Kendal by this road, and from a very old, ruinous bridge had a full view of the ca&s;tle, &s;tretching its dark walls and broken towers round the head of a green hill, to the &s;outhward of the town. The&s;e reliques are, however, too far &s;eparated by the decay of large ma&s;&s;es of the original edifice, and contain little that is individually picture&s;que.</P>
<P>The road now lay through &s;hady lanes and over undulating, but gradually a&s;cending ground, from whence were plea&s;ant views of the valley, with now and then a break in the hills, on the left, open|ing to a glimp&s;e of the di&s;tant fells towards Windermere, gray and of more pointed form than any we had yet &s;een; for hitherto the mountains, though of huge outline, were not &s;o broken, or alpine in their &s;ummits as to &s;trike the fancy with &s;urprize. After about three miles, a very &s;teep hill &s;huts up the vale to the North, and from a gray rock, near the &s;ummit, called Stone-cragg, the pro&s;pect opens over the vale of Kendal with great dignity and beauty. Its

form from hence &s;eems nearly circular; the hills &s;pread round it, and &s;weep with ea&s;y lines into the bottom, green nearly to their &s;ummits, where no fanta&s;tic points bend over it, though rock frequently mingles with the heath. The ca&s;tle, or its low green hill, looked well, nearly in the centre of the land&s;cape, with Kendal and its moun|tain, on the right. Far to the &s;outh, were the groves of Leven's park, almo&s;t the only wood in the &s;cene, and, over the heights beyond, blue hills bounded the horizon. On the we&s;t, an opening in the near &s;teeps di&s;covered clu&s;ters of huge and broken fells, while other breaks, on the ea&s;t, &s;hewed long ridges &s;tretching towards the &s;outh. Nearer us and to the northward, the hills ro&s;e dark and awful, crowding over and inter&s;ecting each other in long and abrupt lines, heath and crag their only furniture.</P>
<P>The rough knolls around us and the dark mountain above gave force to the verdant beauty and tranquillity of the vale below, and &s;eemed e&s;pecially to &s;helter from the &s;torms of the north &s;ome white farms and cottages, &s;cattered among enclo&s;ures in the hollows. Soon after reaching the &s;ummit of the mountain it&s;elf
<Q><L>"A vale appear'd below, a deep retir'd abode,"</L></Q>
and we looked down on the left into Long Sleddale, a little &s;cene of exqui&s;ite beauty, &s;urrounded with images of greatne&s;s. This narrow vale, or glen, &s;hewed a level of the brighte&s;t verdure, with a few cot|tages &s;cattered among groves, enclo&s;ed by dark fells, that ro&s;e &s;teeply,
<PB N="392" REF="400">
yet gracefully, and, at their &s;ummits, bent forward in ma&s;&s;es of &s;hat|tered rock. An hugely pointed mountain, called Keintmoor-head, &s;huts up this &s;weet &s;cene to the north, ri&s;ing in a &s;udden precipice from the vale, and heightening, by barren and gloomy &s;teeps, the miniature beauty, that glowed at its feet. Two mountains, called White&s;ide and Potter's-fell, &s;creen the per&s;pective; Stone-crag is at the &s;outhern end, fronting Keintmoor-head. The vale, &s;een beyond the broken ground we were upon, formed a land&s;cape of, perhaps, unexampled variety and grace of colouring; the tender green of the lowland, the darker verdure of the woods a&s;cending the mountains, the brown rough heath above them, and the impending crags over all, exhibit their numerous &s;hades, within a &s;pace not more than two miles long, or half a mile in breadth.</P>
<P>From the right of our road another valley extended, who&s;e cha|racter is that of &s;imple &s;ublimity, unmixed with any tint of beauty. The va&s;t, yet narrow per&s;pective &s;weeps in ridges of mountains, huge, barren and brown, point beyond point, the highe&s;t of which, Howgill-fell, gives its name to the whole di&s;trict, in which not a wood, a village, or a farm appeared to cheer the long vi&s;ta. A &s;hepherd boy told us the names of almo&s;t all the heights within the horizon, and we are &s;orry not to have written them, for the names of moun|tains are &s;eldom compounded of modern, or trivial denominations, and frequently are &s;omewhat de&s;criptive of their prototypes. He informed us al&s;o, that we &s;hould go over eight miles of Shap-fell, without &s;eeing a hou&s;e; and &s;oon after, at Haw's-foot, we took
<PB N="393" REF="401">
leave of the la&s;t on the road, entering then a clo&s;e valley, &s;urrounded by &s;tupendous mountains of heath and rock, more towering and abrupt than tho&s;e, that had appeared in moorlands on the other &s;ide of Kendal. A &s;tream, rolling in its rocky channel, and cro&s;&s;ing the road under a rude bridge, was all that broke the &s;olitary &s;ilence, or gave animation to the view, except the flocks, that hung upon the preci|pices, and which, at that height, were &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from the grey round &s;tones, thickly &s;tarting out from the heathy &s;teeps. The Highlands of Scotland could &s;carcely have offered to OSSIAN more images of &s;imple greatne&s;s, or more circum&s;tances for melan|choly in&s;piration. Dark glens and fells, the mo&s;&s;y &s;tone, the lonely bla&s;t, de&s;cending on the valley, the roar of di&s;tant torrents every where occurred; and to the bard the <Q REND="inline">"&s;ong of &s;pirits"</Q> would have &s;welled with the&s;e &s;ounds, and their fleeting forms have appeared in the clouds, that frequently floated along the mountain tops.</P>
<P>The road, now a&s;cending Shap-fell, alternately climbed the &s;teeps and &s;unk among the hollows of this &s;overeign mountain, which gives its name to all the &s;urrounding hills; and, during an a&s;cent of four miles, we watched every form and attitude of the features, which compo&s;ed this va&s;t &s;cenery. Sometimes we looked from a precipice into deep vallies, varied only with &s;hades of heath, with the rude &s;ummer hut of the &s;hepherd, or by &s;treams accumulating into tor|rents; and, at others, caught long pro&s;pects over high lands as huge and wild as the nearer ones, which partially intercepted them.</P>
<P>The flocks in this high region are &s;o &s;eldom di&s;turbed by the foot|&s;teps
<PB N="394" REF="402">
of man, that they have not learned to fear him; they continued to graze within a few feet of the carriage, or looked quietly at it, &s;eeming to con&s;ider the&s;e mountains as their own.</P>
<P>Near the &s;ummit of the road, though not of the hill, a retro&s;pec|tive glance gave us a long view over the fells, and of a rich di&s;tance towards Lanca&s;ter, ri&s;ing into blue hills, which admitted glimp&s;es of &s;parkling &s;ea in the bay beyond. This gay per&s;pective, lighted up by a gleam of &s;un&s;hine, and viewed between the brown lines of the nearer mountains, &s;hewed like the miniature painting of a land&s;cape, illuminated beyond a darkened fore-ground.</P>
<P>At the point of every &s;teep, as we a&s;cended, the air &s;eemed to become thinner, and, at the northern &s;ummit of Shap-fell, which we reached after nearly two hours' toil, the wind blew with piercing inten&s;ene&s;s, making it difficult to remain as long as was due to our admiration of the pro&s;pect. The &s;cene of mountains, which bur&s;t upon us, can be compared only to the multitudinous waves of the &s;ea. On the northern, we&s;tern and ea&s;tern &s;cope of the horizon ro&s;e va&s;t ridges of heights, their broken lines &s;ometimes appearing in &s;even or eight &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ranges, though &s;hewing nothing either fan|ta&s;tic or peaked in their forms. The autumnal lights, gleaming on their &s;ides, or &s;hadows &s;weeping in dark lines along them, produced a very &s;ublime effect; while &s;ummits more remote were often mi&s;ty with the &s;treaming &s;hower, and others glittered in the partial rays, or were coloured with the mild azure of di&s;tance. The greater tract of the intervening hills and Shap-fell it&s;elf were, at this time, darkened
<PB N="395" REF="403">
with clouds, while Fancy, awed by the gloom, imaged the ge|nius of We&s;tmoreland brooding over it and directing the &s;cowling &s;torm.</P>
<P>A de&s;cent of nearly four miles brought us to Shap, a &s;traggling village, lying on the &s;ide of a bleak hill, feebly &s;heltered by clumps of trees. Here, leaving the moorlands, we were glad to find our|&s;elves again where <Q REND="inline">"bells have knolled to church,"</Q> and in the mid&s;t of civilized, though &s;imple life. After a &s;hort re&s;t, at a cleanly little inn, we proceeded towards Bampton, a village five miles further in a vale, to which it gives its name, and one mile from Haw&s;water, the lake, that invited us to it. As the road advanced, the &s;ells of this lake fronted it, and, clo&s;ing over the &s;outhern end of Bampton vale, were the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects in the view. They were of a character very different from any yet &s;een; tall, rocky, and of more broken and pointed form. Among them was the high blue peak, called Kid&s;tow|pike; the broader ridge of Wallow-crag; a round and &s;till loftier mountain&mdash;Ikolm-moor, beyond, and, further yet, other ranges of peaked &s;ummits, that overlook Ull&s;water.</P>
<P>In a hollow on the left of the road, called the Vale of Magdalene, are the ruins of Shap-abbey, built in the reign of John, of which little now appears except a tower with pointed windows. The &s;itua|tion is deeply &s;ecluded, and the gloom of the &s;urrounding mountains may have accorded well with mona&s;tic melancholy.</P>
<P>Proceeding towards Bampton we had a momentary peep into Haw&s;water, &s;unk deep among black and haggard rocks, and over|topped
<PB N="396" REF="404">
by the towering fells before named, who&s;e &s;ummits were involved in tempe&s;t, till the &s;un, &s;uddenly breaking out from under clouds, threw a watery gleam a&s;lant the broken top of Kid&s;tow|pike; and his rays, &s;truggling with the &s;hower, produced a fine effect of light, oppo&s;ed to the gloom, that wrapt Ickolm-moor and other huge mountains.</P>
<P>We &s;oon after looked down from the heights of Bampton upon its open vale, checkered with corn and meadows, among which the &s;lender Lowther wound its way from Haw&s;water to the vale of Eden, cro&s;&s;ing that of Bampton to the north. The hills, enriched here and there with hanging woods and &s;eats, were cultivated nearly to their &s;ummits, except where in the &s;outh the rude heights of Haw&s;water almo&s;t excluded the lake and &s;hut up the valley. Immediately below us Bampton-grange lay along the &s;kirt of the hill, and cro&s;&s;ed the Lowther, a grey, rambling and antient village, to which we de|&s;cended among rough common, darkened by plantations of fir, and between corn enclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>The interruption, which inclo&s;ed waters and pathle&s;s mountains give to the intercour&s;e and bu&s;ine&s;s of ordinary life, renders the di&s;|trict, that contains the lakes of Lanca&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland and Cumberland, more thinly inhabited than is due to the healthine&s;s of the climate and, perhaps, to the richne&s;s of the vallies. The roads are always difficult from their &s;teepne&s;s, and in winter are greatly ob&s;tructed by &s;now. That over Shap-fell to Kendal was, &s;ome years &s;ince, entirely impa&s;&s;able, till the inhabitants of a few
<PB N="397" REF="405">
&s;cattered towns &s;ub&s;cribed thirty pounds, and a way was cut wide enough for one hor&s;e, but &s;o deep, that the &s;now was, on each &s;ide, above the rider's head. It is not in this age of communication and intelligence, that any per&s;on will be credulou&s;ly eager to &s;uppo&s;e the inhabitants of one part of the i&s;land con&s;iderably or generally di&s;tingui&s;hed in their characters from tho&s;e of another; yet, per|haps, none can immerge them&s;elves in this country of the lakes, without being &s;truck by the &s;uperior &s;implicity and mode&s;ty of the people. Secluded from great towns and from examples of &s;elfi&s;h &s;plendour, their minds &s;eem to act freely in the &s;phere of their own affairs, without interruption from envy or triumph, as to tho&s;e of others. They are obliging, without &s;ervility, and plain but not rude, &s;o that, when, in acco&s;ting you, they omit the cu&s;tomary appellations, you perceive it to be the familiarity of kindne&s;s, not of di&s;re&s;pect; and they do not bend with meanne&s;s, or hypocri&s;y, but &s;hew an inde|pendent well meaning, without obtru&s;ivene&s;s and without the hope of more than ordinary gain.</P>
<P>Their views of profit from &s;trangers are, indeed, more limited than we could have believed, before witne&s;&s;ing it. The &s;ervants at the little inns confe&s;s them&s;elves by their manner of receiving what you give, to be almo&s;t as much &s;urpri&s;ed as plea&s;ed. A boy, who had opened four or five gates for us between Shap and Bampton, blu&s;hed when we called to him to have &s;ome halfpence; and it frequently happened, that per&s;ons, who had looked at the harne&s;s, or rendered &s;ome little &s;ervices of that &s;ort on the road, pa&s;&s;ed on, before anything
<PB N="398" REF="406">
could be offered them. The confu&s;ion of others, on being paid, induced us to &s;uppo&s;e, at fir&s;t, that enough had not been given; but we were &s;oon informed, that nothing was expected.</P>
<P>The inns, as here at Bampton, are frequently humble; and tho&s;e, who are di&s;po&s;ed to clamour for luxuries, as if there was a crime in not being able to &s;upply them, may confound a &s;imple people, and be them&s;elves greatly di&s;contented, before they go. But tho&s;e, who will be &s;atisfied with comforts, and think the experience of inte|grity, carefulne&s;s and goodwill is it&s;elf a luxury, will be glad to have &s;topped at Bampton and at &s;everal other little villages, where there is &s;ome &s;ort of preparation for travellers.</P>
<P>Nor is this &s;ecluded &s;pot without provi&s;ion for the mind. A be|neficed grammar &s;chool receives the children of the inhabitants, and &s;ends, we believe, &s;ome to an Univer&s;ity. Bi&s;hop GIBSON received his education at it. Bi&s;hop LAW, who was born at Bampton, went daily acro&s;s one, or two of the rude&s;t fells on the lake to another &s;chool, at Martindale; an exerci&s;e of no trifling fatigue, or re&s;o|lution; for among the things to be gained by &s;eeing the lakes is a conception of the extreme wildne&s;s of their boundaries. You arrive with a notion, that you can and dare rove any where among&s;t the mountains; and have only to &s;ee three to have the utmo&s;t terror of lo&s;ing your way.</P>
<P>The danger of wandering in the&s;e regions without a guide is increa&s;ed by an uncertainty, as to the titles of heights; for the people of each village have a name for the part of a mountain neare&s;t
<PB N="399" REF="407">
to them&s;elves, and they &s;ometimes call the whole by that name. The circumference of &s;uch heights is al&s;o too va&s;t, and the flexures too numerous to admit of great accuracy. Skiddaw, Saddleback and Helvellyn, may however, be certainly di&s;tingui&s;hed. There are others, a pa&s;&s;age over which would &s;ave, perhaps, eight or ten miles out of twenty, but which are &s;o little known, except to the &s;hepherds, that they are very rarely cro&s;&s;ed by travellers. We could not tru&s;t to any per&s;on's knowledge of Harter-fell, beyond the head of Haw&s;water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>HAWSWATER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a lake, of which little has been mentioned, per|haps becau&s;e it is inferiour in &s;ize to the others, but which is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the &s;olemn grandeur of its rocks and mountains, that ri&s;e in very bold and awful characters. The water, about three miles long, and at the wide&s;t only half a mile over, nearly de&s;cribes the figure 8, being narrowed in the centre by the projecting &s;hores; and, at this &s;pot, it is &s;aid to be fifty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Cro&s;&s;ing the meadows of Bampton vale and a&s;cending the oppo|&s;ite heights, we approached the fells of Haw&s;water, and, having proceeded for a mile along the &s;ide of hills, the views over the vale and of the &s;outhern mountains changing with almo&s;t every &s;tep, the lake began to open between a very lofty ridge, covered with fore&s;t, and abrupt fells of heath, or naked rock. Soon after, we looked
<PB N="400" REF="408">
upon the fir&s;t expan&s;e of the lake. Its ea&s;tern &s;hore, ri&s;ing in a tre|mendous ridge of rocks, darkened with wood to the &s;ummit, appears to terminate in Wallow-crag, a promontory of towering height, be|yond which the lake winds from view. The finely broken moun|tains on the we&s;t are covered with heath, and the tops impend in crags and precipices; but their a&s;cent from the water is le&s;s &s;udden than that of the oppo&s;ite rocks, and they are &s;kirted by a narrow margin of vivid green, where cattle were feeding, and tufted &s;hrubs and little groves overhung the lake and were reflected on its dark &s;urface. Above, a very few white cottages among wood broke in upon the &s;olitude; higher &s;till, the mountain-flocks were brow&s;ing, and above all, the narrow per&s;pective was clo&s;ed by dark and mon|&s;trous &s;ummits.</P>
<P>As we wound along the bank, the rocks unfolded and di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;econd expan&s;e, with &s;cenery yet more towering and &s;ublime than the fir&s;t. This per&s;pective &s;eemed to be terminated by the huge mountain called Ca&s;tle-&s;treet; but, as we advanced, Harter-fell reared his awful front, impending over the water, and &s;hut in the &s;cene, where, amid&s;t rocks, and at the entrance of a glen almo&s;t choked by fragments from the heights, &s;tands the chapel of Martin|dale, &s;poken by the country people Mardale. Among the fells of this dark pro&s;pect are Lathale, Wilter-crag, Ca&s;tle crag and Riggin|dale, their bold lines appearing beyond each other as they fell into the upper part of the lake, and &s;ome of them &s;hewing only ma&s;&s;es of &s;hattered rock. Kid&s;tow-pike is pre-eminent among the crowding
<PB N="401" REF="409">
&s;ummits beyond the ea&s;tern &s;hore, and the clouds frequently &s;pread their gloom over its point, or fall in &s;howers into the cup within; on the we&s;t High-&s;treet, which overlooks the head of Ull&s;water, is the mo&s;t dignified of the mountains.</P>
<P>Leaving the green margin of the lake, we a&s;cended to the Par&s;on|age, a low, white building on a knoll, &s;heltered by the mountain and a grove of &s;ycamores, with a &s;mall garden in front, falling towards the water. From the door we had a view of the whole lake and the &s;urrounding fells, which the eminence we were upon was ju&s;t rai&s;ed enough to &s;hew to advantage. Nearly oppo&s;ite to it the bold pro|montory of Wallow-crag pu&s;hed its ba&s;e into the lake, where a penin|&s;ula advanced to meet it, &s;pread with bright verdure, on which the hamlet of Martindale lay half concealed among a grove of oak, beech and &s;ycamore, who&s;e tints contra&s;ted with the darker one of the &s;piry &s;pruce, or more clumped Engli&s;h &s;ir, and accorded &s;weetly with the pa&s;toral green beneath. The ridge of precipices, that &s;wept from Wallow-crag &s;outhward, and formed a bay for the upper part of the lake, was de&s;poiled of its fore&s;t; but that, which curved northward, was dark with dwarf-wood to the water's brim, and, opening di&s;tantly to Bampton vale, let in a gay miniature land&s;cape, bright in &s;un&s;hine. Below, the lake reflected the gloom of the woods, and was &s;ometimes marked with long white lines, which, we were told, indicated bad weather; but, except when a &s;udden gu&s;t &s;wept the &s;urface, it gave back every image on the &s;hore, as in a dark mirror.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="410">
The interior of the Par&s;onage was as comfortable as the &s;ituation was intere&s;ting. A neat parlour opened from the pa&s;&s;age, but it was newly painted, and we were &s;hewn into the family room, having a large old-fa&s;hioned chimney corner, with benches to receive a &s;ocial party, and forming a mo&s;t enviable retreat from the &s;torms of the mountains. Here, in the winter evening, a family circle, gathering round a blazing pile of wood on the hearth, might defy the weather and the world. It was delightful to picture &s;uch a party, happy in their home, in the &s;weet affections of kindred and in hone&s;t indepen|dence, conver&s;ing, working and reading occa&s;ionally, while the bla&s;t was &s;truggling again&s;t the ca&s;ement and the &s;now pelting on the roof.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of a long window, overlooking the lake, offered the delights of other &s;ea&s;ons; hence the luxuriance of &s;ummer and the colouring of autumn &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;pread their enchantments over the oppo&s;ite woods, and the meadows that margined the water below; and a little garden of &s;weets &s;ent up its fragrance to that of the honey|&s;uckles, that twined round the window. Here, too, lay a &s;tore of books, and, to in&s;tance that an inhabitant of this remote nook could not exclude an intere&s;t concerning the di&s;tant world, among them was a hi&s;tory of pa&s;&s;ing events. Alas! to what &s;cenes, to what di&s;|play of human pa&s;&s;ions and human &s;uffering did it open! How oppo&s;ite to the &s;implicity, the innocence and the peace of the&s;e!</P>
<P>The venerable father of the man&s;ion was engaged in his duty at his chapel of Martindale, but we were ho&s;pitably received within,
<PB N="403" REF="411">
and heard the next day how gladly he would have rendered any civi|lities to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>On leaving this enviable little re&s;idence, we pur&s;ued the &s;teeps of the mountain behind it, and were &s;oon amid&s;t the flocks and the crags, whence the look-down upon the lake and among the fells was &s;olemn and &s;urpri&s;ing. About a quarter of a mile from the Par|&s;onage, a torrent of &s;ome dignity ru&s;hed pa&s;t us, foaming down a rocky cha&s;m in its way to the lake. Every where, little &s;treams of chry&s;tal clearne&s;s wandered &s;ilently among the mo&s;s and turf, which half concealed their progre&s;s, or da&s;hed over the rocks; and, acro&s;s the large&s;t, &s;heep-bridges of flat &s;tone were thrown, to prevent the flocks from being carried away in attempting to pa&s;s them in winter. The grey &s;tones, that grew among the heath, were &s;potted with mo&s;&s;es of &s;o fine a texture, that it was difficult to a&s;certain whether they were vegetable; their tints were a delicate pea-green and prim|ro&s;e, with a variety of colours, which it was not nece&s;&s;ary to be a botani&s;t to admire.</P>
<P>An hour, pa&s;&s;ed in a&s;cending, brought us to the brow of Bampton vale, which &s;loped gently downward to the north, where it opened to lines of di&s;tant mountains, that extended far into the ea&s;t. The woods of Lowther-park capped two remote hills, and &s;pread luxu|riantly down their &s;ides into the valley; and nearer, Bampton|grange lay at the ba&s;e of a mountain, crowned with &s;ir plantations, over which, in a di&s;tant vale, we di&s;covered the village of Shap and long ridges of the hig hland, pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding day.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="412">
One of the fells we had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed is called Blanara&s;a, at the &s;um|mit of which two grey &s;tones, each about four feet high, and placed upright, at the di&s;tance of nine feet from each other, remain of four, which are remembered to have been formerly there. The place is &s;till called Four Stones; but tradition does not relate the de&s;ign of the monument; whether to limit adjoining di&s;tricts, or to commemo|rate a battle, or a hero.</P>
<P>We de&s;cended gradually into the vale, among thickets of rough oaks, on the bank of a rivulet, which foamed in a deep channel beneath their foliage, and came to a glade &s;o &s;eque&s;tered and gloom|ily over&s;hadowed, that one almo&s;t expected to &s;ee the venerable arch of a ruin, peeping between the branches. It was the very &s;pot, which the founder of a mona&s;tery might have cho&s;en for his retire|ment, where the chantings of a choir might have mingled with the &s;oothing murmur of the &s;tream, and monks have glided beneath the &s;olemn trees in garments &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;hades them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This glade, &s;loping from the eye, opened under &s;preading oaks to a remote glimp&s;e of the vale, with blue hills in the di&s;tance; and on the gra&s;&s;y hillocks of the fore-ground cattle were every where repo&s;ing.</P>
<P>We returned, about &s;un&s;et, to Bampton, after a walk of little more than four miles, which had exhibited a great variety of &s;cenery, beau|tiful, romantic and &s;ublime. At the entrance of the village, the Low|ther and a namele&s;s rivulet, that runs from Haw&s;water, join their
<PB N="405" REF="413">
waters; both &s;treams were now &s;unk in their beds; but in winter they &s;ometimes contend for the conque&s;t and ravage of the neigh|bouring plains. The waters have then ri&s;en to the height of five or &s;ix feet in a meadow forty yards from their &s;ummer channels. In an inclo&s;ure of this vale was fought the la&s;t battle, or &s;kirmi&s;h, with the Scots in We&s;tmoreland; and it is within the telling of the &s;ons of great-grandfathers, that the conte&s;t continued, till the Scots were di&s;|covered to fire only pebbles; the villagers had then the folly to clo&s;e with them and the &s;ucce&s;s to drive them away; but &s;uch was the &s;implicity of the times, that it was called a victory to have made one pri&s;oner. Stories of this &s;ort are not yet entirely forgotten in the deeply inclo&s;ed vales of We&s;tmoreland and Cumberland, where the greater part of the pre&s;ent inhabitants can refer to an ance&s;try of &s;everal centuries, on the &s;ame &s;pot.</P>
<P>We thought Bampton, though a very ill-built village, an enviable &s;pot; having a clergyman, as we heard, of exemplary manners, and, as one of us witne&s;&s;ed, of a mo&s;t faithful earne&s;tne&s;s in addre&s;&s;ing his congregation in the church; being but &s;lightly removed from one of the lakes, that accumulates in a &s;mall &s;pace many of the varie|ties and attractions of the others; and having the adjoining lands di&s;tributed, for the mo&s;t part, into &s;mall farms, &s;o that, as it is not thought low to be without wealth, the poor do not acquire the offen|&s;ive and di&s;reputable habits, by which they are too often tempted to revenge, or re&s;i&s;t the o&s;tentation of the rich.</P>

It winds for about three miles along the we&s;tern heights of this green and open vale, among embowered lanes, that alternately admit and exclude the pa&s;toral &s;cenes below, and the fine land&s;capes on the oppo&s;ite hills, formed by the plantations and antient woods of Lowther-park. The&s;e &s;pread over a long tract, and mingle in &s;weet variety with the lively verdure of lawns and mea|dows, that &s;lope into the valley, and &s;ometimes appear in gleams among the dark thickets. The hou&s;e, of white &s;tone with red win|dow-ca&s;es, embo&s;omed among the woods, has nothing in its appear|ance an&s;werable to the &s;urrounding grounds. Its &s;ituation and that of the park are exqui&s;itely happy, ju&s;t where the vale of Bampton opens to that of Eden, and the long mountainous ridge and peak of Cro&s;s-fell, a&s;piring above them all, &s;tretch before the eye; with the town of Penrith &s;helving along the &s;ide of a di&s;tant mountain, and its beacon on the &s;ummit; the ruins of its ca&s;tle appearing di&s;tinctly at the &s;ame time, crowning a low round hill. The horizon to the north and the ea&s;t is bounded by lines of mountains, range above range, not romantic and &s;urpri&s;ing, but multitudinous and va&s;t. Of the&s;e, Cro&s;s-fell, &s;aid to be the highe&s;t mountain in Cumberland, gives its name to the whole northern ridge, which in its full extent,
<PB N="407" REF="415">
from the neighbourhood of Gill&s;land to that of Kirkby-Steven, is near fifty miles. This per&s;pective of the exten&s;ive vale of Eden has grandeur and magnificence in as high a degree as that of Bampton has pa&s;toral beauty, clo&s;ing in the gloomy &s;olitudes of Haw&s;water. The vale is finely wooded, and variegated with man&s;ions, parks, meadow-land, corn, towns, villages, and all that make a di&s;tant land|&s;cape rich. Among the peculiarities of it, are little mountains of alpine &s;hape, that &s;tart up like pyramids in the middle of the vale, &s;ome covered with wood, others barren and rocky. The &s;cene per|haps only wants a river like the Rhine, or the Thames, to make it the very fine&s;t in England for union of grandeur, beauty and extent.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite Lowther-hall, we gave a farewell look to the plea&s;ant vale of Bampton and its &s;outhern fells, as the road, winding more to the we&s;t, led us over the high lands, that &s;eparate it from the vale of Emont. Then, a&s;cending through &s;hady lanes and among fields where the oat harve&s;t was gathering, we had enchanting retro&s;pects of the vale of Eden, &s;preading to the ea&s;t, with all its chain of moun|tains chequered by the autumnal &s;hadows.</P>
<P>Soon after, the road brought us to the brows of Emont, a narrow well-wooded vale, the river, from which it takes its name, meander|ing through it from Ull&s;water among pa&s;tures and plea&s;ure-grounds, to meet the Lowther near Brougham Ca&s;tle. Penrith and its ca&s;tle and beacon look up the vale from the north, and the a&s;toni&s;hing fells of Ull&s;water clo&s;e upon it in the &s;outh; while Delemain, the hou&s;e and beautiful grounds of Mr. Ha&s;&s;el, Hutton St. John, a vene|rable
<PB N="408" REF="416">
old man&s;ion, and the &s;ingle tower called Dacre-ca&s;tle adorn the valley. But who can pau&s;e to admire the elegancies of art, when &s;urrounded by the wonders of nature? The approach to this &s;ublime lake along the heights of Emont is exqui&s;itely intere&s;ting; for the road, being &s;hrouded by woods, allows the eye only partial glimp&s;es of the gigantic &s;hapes, that are a&s;&s;embled in the di&s;tance, and, awakening high expectation, leaves the imagination, thus elevated, to paint the <Q REND="inline">"forms of things un&s;een."</Q> Thus it was, when we caught a fir&s;t view of the dark broken tops of the fells, that ri&s;e round Ull&s;water, of &s;ize and &s;hape mo&s;t huge, bold, and awful; over&s;pread with a blue my&s;terious tint, that &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;uper|natural, though according in gloom and &s;ublimity with the &s;evere features it involved.</P>
<P>Further on, the mountains began to unfold them&s;elves; their out|lines, broken, abrupt and inter&s;ecting each other in innumerable di|rections, &s;eemed, now and then, to fall back like a multitude at &s;ome &s;upreme command, and permitted an oblique glimp&s;e into the deep vales. A clo&s;e lane then de&s;cended towards Pooly-bridge, where, at length, the lake it&s;elf appeared beyond the &s;preading branches, and, &s;oon after, the fir&s;t reach expanded before us, with all its mountains tumbled round it; rocky, ruinous and va&s;t, impending, yet ri&s;ing in wild confu&s;ion and multiplied points behind each other.</P>
<P>This view of the fir&s;t reach from the foot of Dunmallet, a pointed woody hill, near Pooly-bridge, is one of the fine&s;t on the lake, which here &s;preads in a noble &s;heet, near three miles long, and al|mo&s;t
<PB N="409" REF="417">
two miles broad, to the ba&s;e of Thwaithill-nab, winding round which it di&s;appears, and the whole is then believed to be &s;een. The character of this view is nearly that of &s;imple grandeur; the moun|tains, that impend over the &s;hore in front, are peculiarly awful in their forms and attitudes; on the left, the fells &s;often; woodlands, and their pa&s;tures, colour their lower declivities, and the water is margined with the tendere&s;t verdure, oppo&s;ed to the dark woods and crags above. On the right, a green conical hill &s;lopes to the &s;hore, where cattle were repo&s;ing on the gra&s;s, or &s;ipping the clear wave; further, ri&s;e the bolder rocks of Thwaithill-nab, where the lake di&s;appears, and, beyond, the dark precipices and &s;ummits of fells, that crown the &s;econd reach.</P>
<P>Winding the foot of Dunmallet, the almo&s;t pyramidal hill, that &s;huts up this end of Ull&s;water, and &s;eparates it from the vale of Emont, we cro&s;&s;ed Barton bridge, where this little river, clear as cry&s;tal, i&s;&s;ues from the lake, and through a clo&s;e pa&s;s hurries over a rocky channel to the vale. Its woody &s;teeps, the tufted i&s;land, that interrupts its &s;tream, and the valley beyond, form altogether a picture in fine contra&s;t with the maje&s;ty of Ull&s;water, expanding on the other &s;ide of the bridge.</P>
<P>We followed the &s;kirts of a &s;mooth green hill, the lake, on the other hand, flowing &s;oftly again&s;t the road and &s;hewing every pebble on the beach beneath, and proceeded towards the &s;econd bend; but &s;oon mounted from the &s;hore among the broken knolls of Dacre-com|mon, whence we had various views of the fir&s;t reach, its &s;cenery appear|ing
<PB N="410" REF="418">
in darkened maje&s;ty as the autumnal &s;hadows &s;wept over it. Sometimes, however, the rays, falling in gleams upon the water, gave it the fine&s;t &s;ilvery tone imaginable, &s;ober though &s;plendid. Dunmallet at the foot of the lake was a formal unplea&s;ing object, not large enough to be grand, or wild enough to be romantic.</P>
<P>The ground of the common is finely broken, and is &s;cattered &s;pa|ringly with white cottages, each picture&s;quely &s;hadowed by its dark grove; above, ri&s;e plantations and gray crags which lead the eye forward to the alpine forms, that crown the &s;econd reach, changing their attitudes every in&s;tant as they are approached.</P>
<P>Ull&s;water in all its windings, which give it the form of the letter S, is nearly nine miles long; the width is various, &s;ome|times nearly two miles and &s;eldom le&s;s than one; but Skelling-nab, a va&s;t rock in the &s;econd reach, projects &s;o as to reduce it to le&s;s than a quarter of a mile. The&s;e are chiefly the reputed mea&s;ure|ments, but the eye lo&s;es its power of judging even of the breadth, confounded by the boldne&s;s of the &s;hores and the grandeur of the fells, that ri&s;e beyond; the proportions however are grand, for the water retains its dignity, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;tne&s;s of its ac|companiments; a circum&s;tance, which Derwent-water can &s;carcely boa&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;econd bend, a&s;&s;uming the form of a river, is very long, but generally broad, and brought &s;trongly to remembrance &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;es of the Rhine beyond Coblentz: though, here, the rocks, that ri&s;e over the water, are little wooded; and, there, their &s;kirts are
<PB N="411" REF="419">
never margined by pa&s;ture, or open to &s;uch fairy &s;ummer &s;cenes of vivid green mingling with &s;hades of wood and gleams of corn, as &s;ometimes appear within the rece&s;&s;es of the&s;e wintry mountains. The&s;e cliffs, however, do not &s;hew the variety of hue, or marbled veins, that frequently &s;urpri&s;e and delight on the Rhine, being generally dark and gray, and the varieties in their complexion, when there are any, purely aerial; but they are va&s;t and broken; ri&s;e immediately from the &s;tream, and often &s;hoot their ma&s;&s;es over it; while the expan&s;e of water below accords with the dignity of that river in many of its reaches. Once too, there were other points of re&s;emblance, in the ruins of mona&s;teries and convents, which, though rea&s;on rejoices that they no longer exi&s;t, the eye may be allowed to regret. Of the&s;e, all which now remains on record is, that a &s;ociety of Benedictine monks was founded on the &s;ummit of Dunmallet, and a nunnery of the &s;ame order on a point behind Sowlby-fell; traces of the&s;e ruins, it is &s;aid, may &s;till be &s;een.</P>
<P>Thus grandeur and immen&s;ity are the characteri&s;tics of the left &s;hore of the &s;econd reach; the right exhibits romantic wildne&s;s in the rough ground of Dacre-common and the craggy heights above, and, further on, the &s;weete&s;t forms of repo&s;ing beauty, in the gra&s;&s;y hillocks and undulating cop&s;es of Gowbarrow-park, fringing the water, &s;ometimes over little rocky eminences, that project into the &s;tream, and, at others, in &s;helving bays, where the lake, tran&s;parent as cry&s;tal, breaks upon the pebbly bank, and laves the road, that winds there. Above the&s;e pa&s;toral and &s;ylvan land&s;capes, ri&s;e broken
<PB N="412" REF="420">
precipices, le&s;s tremendous than tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, with pa&s;tures pur&s;uing the crags to a con&s;iderable height, &s;peckled with cattle, which are exqui&s;itely picture&s;que, as they graze upon the knolls and among the old trees, that adorn this finely declining park.</P>
<P>Leaving the hamlet of Watermillock at &s;ome di&s;tance on the left, and pa&s;&s;ing the &s;eat of Mr. Robin&s;on, &s;eque&s;tered in the gloom of beech and &s;ycamores, there are fine views over the &s;econd reach, as the road de&s;cends the common towards Gowbarrow. Among the bolde&s;t fells, that brea&s;t the lake on the left &s;hore, are Holling-fell and Swarth-fell, now no longer boa&s;ting any part of the fore&s;t of Martindale, but &s;hewing huge walls of naked rock, and &s;cars, which many torrents have inflicted. One channel only in this dry &s;ea&s;on retained its &s;hining &s;tream; the cha&s;m was dreadful, parting the mountain from the &s;ummit to the ba&s;e; and its waters in winter, leaping in foam from precipice to precipice, mu&s;t be infinitely &s;ub|lime; not, however, even then from their ma&s;s, but from the length and precipitancy of their de&s;cent.</P>
<P>The per&s;pective as the road de&s;cends into Gowbarrow-park is perhaps the very fine&s;t on the lake. The &s;cenery of the fir&s;t reach is almo&s;t tame when compared with this, and it is difficult to &s;ay where it can be equalled for Alpine &s;ublimity, and for effecting wonder and awful elevation. The lake, after expanding at a di&s;|tance to great breadth, once more lo&s;es it&s;elf beyond the enormous pile of rock called Place-fell, oppo&s;ite to which the &s;hore, &s;eeming to
<PB N="413" REF="421">
clo&s;e upon all further progre&s;s, is bounded by two promontories cover|ed with woods, that &s;hoot their luxuriant foliage to the water's edge. The &s;hattered ma&s;s of gray rock, called Yew-crag, ri&s;es immediately over the&s;e, and, beyond, a glen opens to a chaos of mountains more &s;olemn in their a&s;pect, and &s;ingular in their &s;hapes, than any which have appeared, point crowding over point in lofty &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Among the&s;e is Stone-cro&s;s-pike and huge Helvellyn, &s;cowling over all; but, though this retains its pre eminence, its dignity is lo&s;t in the ma&s;s of alps around and below it. A fearful gloom involved them; the &s;ha|dows of a &s;tormy &s;ky upon mountains of dark rock and heath. All this is &s;een over the woody fore-ground of the park, which, &s;oon &s;hrouding us in its bowery lanes, allowed the eye and the fancy to repo&s;e, while venturing towards new forms and a&s;&s;emblages of &s;ublimity.</P>
<P>Meantime, the green &s;hade, under which we pa&s;&s;ed, where the &s;ultry low of cattle, and the &s;ound of &s;treams hurrying from the heights through the cop&s;es of Gowbarrow to the lake below, were all that broke the &s;tillne&s;s; the&s;e, with gleamings of the water, clo&s;e on the left, between the foliage, and which was ever changing its hue, &s;ometimes a&s;&s;uming the &s;oft purple of a pigeon's neck, at others the &s;ilvery tint of &s;un&s;hine&mdash;the&s;e circum&s;tances of imagery were in &s;oothing and beautiful variety with the gigantic vi&s;ions we had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The road &s;till pur&s;uing this border of the lake, the cop&s;es opened to partial views of the bold rocks, that form the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and
<PB N="414" REF="422">
many a wild rece&s;s and &s;olemn glen appeared and vani&s;hed among them, &s;ome &s;hewing only broken fells, the &s;ides of others &s;haggy with fore&s;ts, and nearly all lined, at their ba&s;es, with narrow pa&s;tures of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite verdure. Thus de&s;cending upon a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;weeping bays, where the &s;hades parted, and admitted the lake, that flowed even with us, and again retreating from it over gentle eminences, where it glittered only between the leaves; cro&s;&s;ing the rude bridges of &s;everal becks, rapid, clear and foaming among dark &s;tones, and receiving a green tint from the clo&s;ely &s;hadowing trees, but neither precipitous enough in their de&s;cent, nor ample enough in their cour&s;e, to increa&s;e the dignity of the &s;cene, we came, after pa&s;&s;|ing nearly three miles through the park, to Lyulph's Tower. This man&s;ion, a &s;quare, gray edifice, with turreted corners, battlements and windows in the Gothic &s;tyle, has been built by the pre&s;ent Duke of Norfolk in one of the fine&s;t &s;ituations of a park, abounding with views of the grand and the &s;ublime. It &s;tands on a green eminence, a little removed from the water, backed with wood and with pa&s;tures ri&s;ing abruptly beyond, to the cliffs and crags that crown them. In front, the ground falls finely to the lake's edge, broken, yet gentle, and &s;cattered over with old trees, and darkened with cop&s;es, which mingle in fine variety of tints with the light verdure of the turf beneath. Herds of deer, wandering over the knolls, and cattle, repo|&s;ing in the &s;hade, completed this &s;weet land&s;cape.</P>
<P>The lake is hence &s;een to make one of its bolde&s;t expan&s;es, as it &s;weeps round Place-fell, and flows into the third and la&s;t bend of this
<PB N="415" REF="423">
wonderful vale. Lyulph's Tower looks up this reach to the &s;outh, and to the ea&s;t traces all the fells and curving banks of Gowbarrow, that bind the &s;econd; while, to the we&s;t, a dark glen opens to a glimp&s;e of the &s;olemn alps round Helvellyn; and all the&s;e objects are &s;een over the mild beauty of the park.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing fine &s;weeps of the &s;hore and over bold headlands, we came oppo&s;ite to the va&s;t promontory, called Place-fell, that pu&s;hes its craggy foot into the lake, like a lion's claw, round which the waters make a &s;udden turn, and enter Patterdale, their third and final expan&s;e. In this reach, they lo&s;e the form of a river, and re&s;ume that of a lake, being clo&s;ed, at three miles di&s;tance, by the ruinous rocks, that guard the gorge of Patterdale, backed by a multitude of fells. The water, in this &s;cope, is of oval form, bounded on one &s;ide by the precipices of Place-fell, Martindale-fell, and &s;everal others equally rude and awful that ri&s;e from its edge, and &s;hew no lines of verdure, or ma&s;&s;es of wood, but retire in rocky bays, or project in va&s;t promontories athwart it. The oppo&s;ite &s;hore is le&s;s &s;evere and more romantic; the rocks are lower and richly wooded, and, often receding from the water, leave room for a tract of pa&s;ture, meadow land and corn, to margin their ruggedne&s;s. At the upper end, the village of Patterdale, and one or two white farms, peep out from among trees beneath the &s;cowling mountains, that clo&s;e the &s;cene; pitched in a rocky nook, with corn and meadow land, &s;loping gently in front to the lake, and, here and there, a &s;cattered grove. But this &s;cene is viewed to more advantage from one of the two woody emi|nences,
<PB N="416" REF="424">
that overhang the lake, ju&s;t at the point where it forms its la&s;t angle, and, like an opened compa&s;s, &s;preads its two arms before the eye. The&s;e heights are extremely beautiful, viewed from the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore, and had long charmed us at a di&s;tance. Approaching them, we cro&s;&s;ed another torrent, Glencoyn-beck, or Airey-force, which here divides not only the e&s;tates of the Duke of Norfolk and Mr. Hodgkin&s;on, but the counties of We&s;tmoreland and Cumber|land; and all the fells beyond, that enclo&s;e the la&s;t bend of Ull&s;water, are in Patterdale. Here, on the right, at the feet of awful rocks, was &s;pread a gay autumnal &s;cene, in which the pea&s;ants were &s;inging merrily as they gathered the oats into &s;heafs; woods, turfy hillocks, and, above all, tremendous crags, abruptly clo&s;ing round the yellow harve&s;t. The figures, together with the whole land&s;cape, re&s;embled one of tho&s;e beautifully fanta&s;tic &s;cenes, which fable calls up before the wand of the magician.</P>
<P>Entering Glencoyn woods and &s;weeping the bolde&s;t bay of the lake, while the water da&s;hed with a &s;trong &s;urge upon the &s;hore, we at length mounted a road frightful from its &s;teepne&s;s and its crags, and gained one of the wooded &s;ummits &s;o long admired. From hence the view of Ull&s;water is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and various, that its &s;hores exhibit, comprehending its two principal reaches, and though not the mo&s;t picture&s;que, it is certainly the mo&s;t grand. To the ea&s;t, extends the middle &s;weep in long and equal per&s;pective, walled with barren fells on the right, and margined on the left with the pa&s;toral rece&s;&s;es and bowery projections of Gowbarrow park.
<PB N="417" REF="425">
The rude mountains above almo&s;t &s;eemed to have fallen back from the &s;hore to admit this land&s;cape within their hollow bo&s;om, and then, bending abruptly, appear, like Milton's Adam viewing the &s;leeping Eve, to hang over it enamoured.</P>
<P>Lyulph's Tower is the only object of art, except the hamlet of Watermillock, &s;een in the di&s;tant per&s;pective, that appears in the &s;econd bend of Ull&s;water; and this lo&s;es much of its effect from the &s;quare uniformity of the &s;tructure, and the glaring green of its painted window-ca&s;es. This is the longe&s;t reach of the lake.</P>
<P>Place-fell, which divides the two la&s;t bends, and was immediately oppo&s;ite to the point we were on, is of the bolde&s;t form. It projects into the water, an enormous ma&s;s of grey crag, &s;carred with dark hues; thence retiring a little it again bends forward in huge cliffs, and finally &s;tarts up into a va&s;t perpendicular face of rock. As a &s;ingle object, it is wonderfully grand; and, connected with the &s;cene, its effect is &s;ublime. The lower rocks are called Silver-rays, and not inaptly; for, when the &s;un &s;hines upon them, their variegated &s;ides &s;omewhat re&s;emble in brightne&s;s the rays &s;treaming beneath a cloud.</P>
<P>The la&s;t reach of Ull&s;water, which is on the right of this point, expands into an oval, and its maje&s;tic &s;urface is &s;potted with little rocky i&s;lets, that would adorn a le&s;s &s;acred &s;cene; here they are pret|tine&s;&s;es, that can &s;carcely be tolerated by the grandeur of its charac|ter. The tremendous mountains, which &s;cowl over the gorge of Patterdale; the cliffs, ma&s;&s;y, broken and overlooked by a multitude
<PB N="418" REF="426">
of dark &s;ummits, with the grey walls of Swarth and Martindale fells, that upheave them&s;elves on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, form altogether one of the mo&s;t grand and awful pictures on the lake; yet, admirable and impre&s;&s;ive as it is, as to &s;olemnity and a&s;toni&s;hment, its effect with us was not equal to that of the more alpine &s;ketch, caught in di&s;tant per&s;pective from the de&s;cent into Gowbarrow-park.</P>
<P>In the&s;e views of Ull&s;water, &s;ublimity and greatne&s;s are the pre|dominating characters, though beauty often glows upon the we&s;tern bank. The mountains are all bold, gloomy and &s;evere. When we &s;aw them, the &s;ky accorded well with the &s;cene, being frequently darkened by autumnal clouds; and the equinoctial gale &s;wept the &s;urface of the lake, marking its blackne&s;s with long white lines, and beating its waves over the rocks to the foliage of the thickets above. The trees, that &s;hade the&s;e eminences, give greater force to the &s;cenes, which they either partially exclude, or wholly admit, and become them&s;elves fine objects, enriched as they are with the darke&s;t mo&s;s.</P>
<P>From hence the ride to the village of Patterdale, at the lake's head, is, for the fir&s;t part, over precipices covered with wood, whence you look down, on the left, upon the water, or upon pa&s;tures &s;tretching to it; on the right, the rocks ri&s;e abruptly, and often impend their ma&s;&s;es over the road; or open to narrow dells, green, rocky and overlooked by endle&s;s mountains.</P>
<P>About half way to the village of Patterdale, a penin&s;ula &s;preads from this &s;hore into the lake, where a white hou&s;e, peeping from a grove and &s;urrounded with green enclo&s;ures, is beautifully placed.
<PB N="419" REF="427">
This is an inn, and, perhaps, the principal one, as to accommoda|tion; but, though its &s;ituation, on a &s;pot which on each &s;ide com|mands the lake, is very fine, it is not comparable, in point of wild|ne&s;s and &s;ublimity, to that of the cottage, called the King's Arms, at Patterdale. In the way thither, are enchanting catches of the lake, between the trees on the left, and peeps into the glens, that wind among the alps towards Helvellyn, on the right. The&s;e multiply near the head of Ull&s;water, where they &s;tart off as from one point, like radii, and conclude in trackle&s;s &s;olitudes.</P>
<P>It is difficult to &s;pread varied pictures of &s;uch &s;cenes before the imagination. A repetition of the &s;ame images of rock, wood and water, and the &s;ame epithets of grand, va&s;t and &s;ublime, which nece&s;|&s;arily occur, mu&s;t appear tautologous, on paper, though their arche|types in nature, ever varying in outline, or arrangement, exhibit new vi&s;ions to the eye, and produce new &s;hades of effect on the mind. It is difficult al&s;o, where the&s;e delightful differences have been expe|rienced, to forbear dwelling on the remembrance, and attempting to &s;ketch the peculiarities, which occa&s;ioned them. The &s;cenery at the head of Ull&s;water is e&s;pecially productive of &s;uch difficulties, where a wi&s;h to pre&s;ent the picture, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the impo&s;&s;ibility of doing &s;o, except by the pencil, meet and oppo&s;e each other.</P>
<P>Patterdale it&s;elf is a name &s;omewhat familiar to recollection, from the circum&s;tance of the chief e&s;tate in it having given to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, for &s;everal centuries, the title of Kings of Patterdale. The la&s;t per&s;on &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed was richer than his ance&s;tors, having increa&s;ed his
<PB N="420" REF="428">
income, by the mo&s;t ludicrous par&s;imony, to a thou&s;and pounds a year. His &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or is an indu&s;trious country gentleman, who has improved the &s;ort of farming man&s;ion, annexed to the e&s;tate, and, not affecting to depart much from the &s;imple manners of the other inhabitants, is re&s;pectable enough to be generally called by his own name of Moun&s;ey, in&s;tead of the title, which was probably &s;el|dom given to his ance&s;tors, but in &s;ome &s;ort of mockery.</P>
<P>The village is very humble, as to the conditions and views of the inhabitants; and very re&s;pectable, as to their integrity and &s;implicity, and to the contentment, which is proved by the infrequency of emi|grations to other di&s;tricts. It &s;traggles at the feet of fells, &s;omewhat removed from the lake and near the entrance of the wild vale of Glenridding. Its white church is &s;een nearly from the commence|ment of the la&s;t reach, ri&s;ing among trees, and in the church-yard are the ruins of an antient yew, of remarkable &s;ize and venerable beauty; its trunk, hollowed and &s;ilvered by age, re&s;embles twi&s;ted roots; yet the branches, that remain above, are not of melancholy black, but flouri&s;h in rich verdure and flaky foliage.</P>
<P>The inn is beyond the village, &s;ecurely &s;heltered under high crags, while enormous fells, clo&s;e on the right, open to the gorge of Patter|dale; and Coldrill-beck, i&s;&s;uing from it, de&s;cends among the corn and meadows, to join the lake at a little di&s;tance. We had a happy evening at this cleanly cottage, where there was no want, without its recompen&s;e, from the civil offices of the people. Among the rocks, that ro&s;e over it, is a &s;tation, which has been more frequently &s;elected
<PB N="421" REF="429">
than any other on the lake by the painter and the lover of the <HI>bean id&eacute;e,</HI> as the French and Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS expre&s;&s;ively term what Mr. BURKE explains in his definition of the word <HI>fine.</HI> Below the point, on which we &s;tood, a tract of corn and meadow land fell gently to the lake, which expanded in great maje&s;ty beyond, bounded on the right by the precipices of many fells, and, on the left, by rocks finely wooded, and of more broken and &s;piry outline. The undulating pa&s;tures and cop&s;es of Gowbarrow clo&s;ed the per|&s;pective. Round the whole of the&s;e &s;hores, but particularly on the left, ro&s;e clu&s;ters of dark and pointed &s;ummits, a&s;&s;uming great variety of &s;hape, among&s;t which Helvellyn was &s;till pre-eminent. Imme|diately around us, all was va&s;t and gloomy; the fells mount &s;wiftly and to enormous heights, leaving at their ba&s;es only crags and hillock, tufted with thickets of dwarf-oak and holly, where the beau|tiful cattle, that adorned them, and a few &s;heep, were picking a &s;canty &s;upper among the heath.</P>
<P>From this &s;pot glens open on either hand, that lead the eye only to a chaos of mountains. The profile of one near the &s;ore-ground on the right is remarkably grand, &s;helving from the &s;ummit in one va&s;t &s;weep of rock, with only &s;ome interruption of craggy points near its ba&s;e, into the water. On one &s;ide, it unites with the fells in the gorge of Patterdale, and, on the other, winds into a bold bay for the lake. Among the highlands, &s;een over the left &s;hore, is Common-fell, a large heathy mountain, which appeared to face us. Somewhat nearer, is a lower one, called Glenridding, and above it the Nab.
<PB N="422" REF="430">
Gra&s;&s;dale has Glenridding and the Nab on one &s;ide towards the water, and Birks-fell and St. Sunday's-crag over that, on the other. The points, that ri&s;e above the Nab, are Stridon-edge, then Cove's head, and, over all, the precipices of dark Helvellyn, now appearing only at intervals among the clouds.</P>
<P>Not only every fell of this wild region has a name, but almo&s;t every crag of every fell, &s;o that &s;hepherds &s;itting at the fire-&s;ide can direct each other to the exact &s;pot among the mountains, where a &s;tray &s;heep has been &s;een.</P>
<P>Among the rocks on the right &s;hore, is Martindale-fell, once &s;haded with a fore&s;t, from which it received its name, and which &s;preading to a va&s;t extent over the hills and vallies beyond, even as far as Haw&s;|water, darkened the front of Swarth-fell and &s;everal others, that impend over the fir&s;t and &s;econd reach of Ull&s;water. Of the moun|tains, which tower above the glen of Patterdale, the highe&s;t are Har|ter's-fell, Kid&s;tow-pike, and the ridge, called the High-&s;treet; a name, which reminded us of the German denomination, <HI>Berg &s;tra&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The effect of a &s;tormy evening upon the &s;cenery was &s;olemn. Clouds &s;moked along the fells, veiling them for a moment, and pa&s;&s;ing on to other &s;ummits; or &s;ometimes they involved the lower &s;teeps, leaving the tops unob&s;cured and re&s;embling i&s;lands in a di&s;tant ocean. The lake was dark and tempe&s;tuous, da&s;hing the rocks with a &s;trong foam. It was a &s;cene worthy of the &s;ublimity of O&s;&s;ian, and brought to recollection &s;ome touches of his gloomy pencil. <Q REND="inline">"When the &s;torms of the mountains come, when the north lifts the waves on high, I &s;it by the &s;ounding &s;hore, &amp;c."</Q></P>

A large hawk, &s;ailing proudly in the air, and wheeling among the &s;tormy clouds, &s;uperior to the &s;hock of the gu&s;t, was the only ani|mated object in the upward pro&s;pect. We were told, that the eagles had for&s;aken their aeries in this neighbourhood and in Borrowdale, and are fled to the i&s;le of Man; but one had been &s;een in Patter|dale, the day before, which, not being at its full growth, could not have arrived from a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>We returned to our low-roofed habitation, where, as the wind &s;wept in hollow gu&s;ts along the mountains and &s;trove again&s;t our ca&s;ements, the crackling blaze of a wood fire lighted up the cheer|fulne&s;s, which, &s;o long &s;ince as Juvenal's time, has been allowed to ari&s;e from the contra&s;t of ea&s;e again&s;t difficulty. <HI>Suave mari magno, turbantibus aequora ventis;</HI> and, however we might exclaim,<Q><L>&mdash;"be my retreat</L>

<HEAD>BROUGHAM CASTLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, we proceeded from Ull&s;water along the vale of Emont, &s;o &s;weetly adorned by the woods and lawns of Dalemain, the &s;eat of Mr. Ha&s;&s;el, who&s;e man&s;ion is &s;een in the bot|tom. One of the mo&s;t magnificent pro&s;pects in the country is when this vale opens to that of Eden. The mountainous range of Cro&s;s-fell fronted us, and its appearance, this day, was very &s;triking, for the effect of autumnal light and &s;hade. The upper range, bright in &s;un&s;hine, appeared to ri&s;e, like light clouds above the lower, which was involved in dark &s;hadow, &s;o that it was a con&s;iderable time before the eye could detect the illu&s;ion. The effect of this was inexpre&s;&s;ibly intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Within view of Emont bridge, which divides the counties of Cumberland and We&s;tmoreland, is that memorial of antient times, &s;o often de&s;cribed under the name of Arthur's Round Table; a green circular &s;pot of forty paces diameter, inclo&s;ed by a dry ditch, and, beyond this, by a bank; each in &s;ufficient pre&s;ervation to &s;hew exactly what has been its form. In the mid&s;t of the larger circle is another of only &s;even paces diameter. We have no means of adding to, or even of corroborating any of the well known conjec|tures, concerning the u&s;e of this rude and certainly very antient monument. Tho&s;e not qualified to propo&s;e deci&s;ions in this re&s;pect
<PB N="425" REF="433">
may, however, &s;uffer them&s;elves to believe, that the bank without the ditch and the enclo&s;ure within it were places for different cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons, intere&s;ted as parties, or &s;pectators, in &s;ome tran&s;actions, pa&s;&s;ing within the inner circle; and that the&s;e, whether religious, civil, or military ceremonies, were rendered di&s;tinct and con&s;picuous, for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ing them upon the memory of the &s;pecta|tors, at a time when memory and tradition were the only pre&s;erva|tives of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing a bridge, under which the Lowther, from winding and romantic banks, enters the vale of Eden, we a&s;cended between the groves of Bird's Ne&s;t, or, as it is now called, Brougham Hall; a white man&s;ion, with battlements and gothic windows, having for|merly a bird painted on the front. It is perched among woods, on the brow of a &s;teep, but not lofty hill, and commands enchant|ing pro&s;pects over the vale. The winding Emont; the ruins of Brougham Ca&s;tle on a green knoll of Whin&s;ield park, &s;urrounded with old groves; far beyond this, the highlands of Cro&s;s-fell; to the north, Carleton-hall, the hand&s;ome modern man&s;ion of Mr. Wal|lace, amid&s;t lawns of incomparable verdure and luxuriant woods falling from the heights; further &s;till, the mountain, town and bea|con of Penrith; the&s;e are the principal features of the rich land&s;cape, &s;pread before the eye from the &s;ummit of the hill, at Bird's Ne&s;t.</P>
<P>As we de&s;cended to Brougham Ca&s;tle, about a mile further, its ruined ma&s;&s;es of pale red &s;tone, tufted with &s;hrubs and plants, ap|peared between groves of fir, beach, oak and a&s;h, amid&s;t the broken
<PB N="426" REF="434">
ground of Whinfield park, a quarter of a mile through which brought us to the ruin it&s;elf. It was guarded by a &s;turdy ma&s;tiff, worthy the office of porter to &s;uch a place, and a good effigy of the Sir Porter of a former age. Brougham Ca&s;tle, venerable for its well|certified antiquity and for the hoary ma&s;&s;es it now exhibits, is render|ed more intere&s;ting by having been occa&s;ionally the re&s;idence of the humane and generous Sir Philip Sydney; who had only to look from the windows of this once noble edifice to &s;ee his own <Q REND="inline">"Arcadia"</Q> &s;preading on every &s;ide. The land&s;cape probably awakened his imagination, for it was during a vi&s;it here, that the greate&s;t part of that work was written.</P>
<P>This edifice, once among&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t important of the border fortre&s;&s;es, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been founded by the Romans; but the fir&s;t hi&s;torical record concerning it is dated in the time of William the Conqueror, who granted it to his nephew, Hugh de Al|binois. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors held it, till 1170, when Hugh de Morville, one of the murderers of Thomas a Becket, forfeited it by his crime. Brougham was afterwards granted by King John to a grand&s;on of Hugh, Robert de Vipont, who&s;e grand&s;on again forfeited the e&s;tate, which was, however, re&s;tored to his daughters, one of whom marry|ing a De Clifford, it remained in this family, till a daughter of the celebrated Counte&s;s of Pembroke gave it by marriage to that of the Tuftons, Earls of Thanet, in which it now remains.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle has been thrice nearly demoli&s;hed; fir&s;t by neglect, during the minority of Roger de Vipont, after which it was &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="427" REF="435">
re&s;tored to receive James the Fir&s;t, on his return from Scotland, in 1617; &s;econdly, in the civil wars of Charles the Fir&s;t's time; and thirdly, in 1728, when great part of the edifice was deliberately taken down, and the materials &s;old for one hundred pounds. Some of the walls &s;till remaining are twelve feet thick, and the places are vi&s;ible, in which the ma&s;&s;y gates were held to them by hinges and bolts of uncommon &s;ize. A fuller proof of the many &s;acrifices of comfort and convenience, by which the highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es in former ages were glad to purcha&s;e &s;ecurity, is very &s;eldom afforded, than by the three detached parts &s;till left of this edifice; but they &s;hew nothing of the magnificence and gracefulne&s;s, which &s;o often charm the eye in gothic ruins. In&s;tead of the&s;e, they exhibit &s;ymptoms of the cruel|ties, by which their fir&s;t lords revenged upon others the wretched|ne&s;s of the continual &s;u&s;picion felt by them&s;elves. Dungeons, &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ages and heavy iron rings remain to hint of unhappy wretches, who were, perhaps, re&s;cued only by death from the&s;e horrible en|gines of a tyrant's will. The bones probably of &s;uch victims are laid beneath the damp earth of the&s;e vaults.</P>
<P>A young woman from a neighbouring farm-hou&s;e conducted us over broken banks, wa&s;hed by the Emont, to what had been the grand entrance of the ca&s;tle; a venerable gothic gateway, dark and of great depth, pa&s;&s;ing under a &s;quare tower, &s;inely &s;hadowed by old elms. Above, are a cro&s;s-loop and two tier of &s;mall pointed windows; no battlements appear at the top; but four rows of cor|bells, which probably once &s;upported them, now prop &s;ome tufts of antient thorn, that have roots in their fractures.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="436">
As we pa&s;&s;ed under this long gateway, we looked into what is &s;till called the Keep, a &s;mall vaulted room, receiving light only from loops in the outward wall. Near a large fire-place, yet entire, is a trap door leading to the dungeon below; and, in an oppo&s;ite corner, a door-ca&s;e to narrow &s;tairs, that wind up the turret, where too, as well as in the vault, pri&s;oners were probably &s;ecured. One almo&s;t &s;aw the &s;urly keeper de&s;cending through this door-ca&s;e, and heard him rattle the keys of the chambers above, li&s;tening with indiffer|ence to the clank of chains and to the echo of that groan below, which &s;eemed to rend the heart it bur&s;t from.</P>
<P>This gloomy gateway, which had once &s;ounded with the trum|pets and hor&s;es of James the Fir&s;t, when he vi&s;ited the Earl of Cum|berland, this gateway, now &s;erving only to &s;helter cattle from the &s;torm, opens, at length, to a gra&s;&s;y knoll, with bold ma&s;&s;es of the ruin &s;cattered round it and a few old a&s;h trees, waving in the area. Through a fractured arch in the rampart &s;ome features in the &s;cenery without appear to advantage; the Emont falling over a weir at &s;ome di&s;tance, with fulling-mills on the bank above; beyond, the pa&s;tured &s;lopes and woodlands of Carleton park, and Cro&s;s-fell &s;weeping the back-ground.</P>
<P>Of the three ruinous parts, that now remain of the edifice, one large &s;quare ma&s;s, near the tower and gateway, appears to have con|tained the principal apartments; the walls are of great height, and, though roofle&s;s, nearly entire. We entered what &s;eemed to have been the great hall, now choaked with rubbi&s;h and weeds. It was intere&s;ting to look upwards through the void, and trace by the
<PB N="429" REF="437">
many window-ca&s;es, that appeared at different heights in the walls, &s;omewhat of the plan of apartments, who&s;e floors and ceilings had long &s;ince vani&s;hed; maje&s;tic reliques, which &s;hewed, that here, as well as at Hardwick, the chief rooms had been in the &s;econd &s;tory. Door-ca&s;es, that had opened to rooms without this building, with remains of pa&s;&s;ages within the walls, were frequently &s;een, and, here and there, in a corner at a va&s;t height, fragments of a winding &s;tair|ca&s;e, appearing beyond the arch of a &s;lender door-way.</P>
<P>We were tempted to enter a ruinous pa&s;&s;age below, formed in the great thickne&s;s of the walls; but it was &s;oon lo&s;t in darkne&s;s, and we were told that no per&s;on had ventured to explore the end of this, or of many &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages among the ruins, now the dens of &s;er|pents and other venomous reptiles. It was probably a &s;ecret way to the great dungeon, which may &s;till be &s;een, underneath the hall; for the roof remains, though what was called the Sweating Pillar, from the dew, that was owing to its damp &s;ituation and its &s;eclu&s;ion from outward air, no longer &s;upports it. Large iron rings, fa&s;tened to the carved heads of animals, are &s;till &s;hewn in the walls of this dungeon. Not a &s;ingle loop-hole was left by the contriver of this hideous vault for the refre&s;hment of pri&s;oners; yet were they in&s;ulted by &s;ome di&s;play of gothic elegance, for the pillar already mentioned, &s;upporting the centre of the roof, &s;pread from thence into eight branches, which de&s;cended the walls, and terminated at the floor in the heads, holding the iron rings.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ma&s;s of the ruin, which, though at a con&s;iderable
<PB N="430" REF="438">
di&s;tance from the main building, was formerly connected with it, &s;hews the walls of many &s;mall chambers, with reliques of the pa&s;|&s;ages and &s;tairs, that led to them. But, perhaps, the only picture&s;que feature of the ca&s;tle is the third detachment; a &s;mall tower finely &s;hat|tered, having near its top a flouri&s;hing a&s;h, growing from the &s;olid walls, and overlooking what was once the moat. We mounted a perilous &s;tair-ca&s;e, of which many &s;teps were gone, and others trembled to the pre&s;&s;ure; then gained a turret, of which two &s;ides were al&s;o fallen, and, at length, a&s;cended to the whole magnificence and &s;ublimity of the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t, &s;pread nearly all the rich vale of Eden, terminated by the Stainmore hills and other highlands of York&s;hire; to the north|ea&s;t, the mountains of Cro&s;s-fell bounded the long land&s;cape. The nearer grounds were Whinfield-park, broken, towards the Emont, into &s;hrubby &s;teeps, where the deep red of the &s;oil mingled with the verdure of foliage; part of Sir Michael le Fleming's woods round|ing a hill on the oppo&s;ite bank, and, beyond, a wide extent of low land. To the &s;outh, &s;welled the upland boundaries of Bampton|vale, with Lowther-woods, &s;hading the pa&s;tures and di&s;tantly crowned by the fells of Haw&s;water; more to the we&s;t, Bird's Ne&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"bo&s;omed high in tufted trees;"</Q> at its foot, Lowther-bridge, and, a little fur|ther, the neat hamlet and bridge of Emont. In the low lands, &s;till nearer, the Lowther and Emont united, the latter flowing in &s;hining circles among the woods and deep-green meadows of Carleton-park. Beyond, at a va&s;t di&s;tance to the we&s;t and north, ro&s;e all the alps of
<PB N="431" REF="439">
all the lakes! an horizon &s;carcely to be equalled in England. Among the&s;e broken mountains, the &s;haggy ridge of Saddleback was proudly pre-eminent; but one forked top of its rival Skiddaw peeped over its declining &s;ide. Helvellyn, huge and mi&s;-&s;hapen, towered above the fells of Ull&s;water. The &s;un's rays, &s;treaming from beneath a line of dark clouds, that overhung the we&s;t, gave a tint of &s;ilvery light to all the&s;e alps, and reminded us of the fir&s;t exqui&s;ite appear|ance of the mountains, at Goode&s;berg, which, however, in grandeur and elegance of outline, united with picture&s;que richne&s;s, we have never &s;een equalled.</P>
<P>Of the walls around us every ledge, marking their many &s;tories, was embo&s;&s;ed with luxuriant vegetation. Tufts of the hawthorn &s;eemed to grow from the &s;olid &s;tone, and &s;lender &s;aplings of a&s;h waved over the de&s;erted door-ca&s;es, where, at the transforming hour of twilight, the &s;uper&s;titious eye might mi&s;take them for &s;pectres of &s;ome early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the ca&s;tle, re&s;tle&s;s from guilt, or of &s;ome &s;uf|ferer per&s;evering from vengeance.</P>

<HEAD>THE TOWN AND BEACON OF PENRITH.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING pur&s;ued the road one mile further, for the pur|po&s;e of vi&s;iting the tender memorial of pious affection, &s;o often de|&s;cribed under the name of Counte&s;s' Pillar, we returned to Emont|bridge, and from thence reached Penrith, pronounced Peyrith, the mo&s;t &s;outhern town of Cumberland. So far off as the head of Ull&s;|water, fourteen miles, this is talked of as an important place, and looked to as the &s;torehou&s;e of whatever is wanted more than the fields and lakes &s;upply. Tho&s;e, who have lived chiefly in large towns, have to learn from the wants and dependencies of a people thinly &s;cattered, like the inhabitants of all mountainous regions, the great value of any places of mutual re&s;ort, however little di&s;tingui&s;hed in the general view of a country. Penrith is &s;o often mentioned in the neighbourhood, that the fir&s;t appearance of it &s;omewhat di&s;appoint|ed us, becau&s;e we had not con&s;idered how many &s;erious rea&s;ons tho&s;e, who talked of it, might have for their e&s;timation, which &s;hould yet not at all relate to the qualities, that render places intere&s;ting to a traveller.</P>
<P>The town, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of old hou&s;es, &s;traggles along two &s;ides of the high north road, and is built upon the &s;ide of a mountain, that towers to great height above it, in &s;teep and heathy knolls, un&s;haded by a &s;ingle tree. Eminent, on the &s;ummit of this moun|tain,
<PB N="433" REF="441">
&s;tands the old, &s;olitary beacon, vi&s;ible from almo&s;t every part of Penrith, which, notwith&s;tanding its many &s;ymptoms of antiquity, is not deficient of neatne&s;s. The hou&s;es are chiefly white, with door and window ca&s;es of the red &s;tone found in the neighbourhood. Some of the &s;maller have over their doors dates of the latter end of the &s;ixteenth century. There are &s;everal inns, of which that called Old Buchanan's was recommended to us, fir&s;t, by the recollection, that Mr. Gray had mentioned it, and afterwards by the comfort and civility we found there.</P>
<P>Some traces of the Scotti&s;h dialect and pronunciation appear as far &s;outh as Lanca&s;hire; in We&s;tmoreland, they become &s;tronger; and, at Penrith, are extremely di&s;tinct and general, &s;erving for one among many peaceful indications of an approach, once notified chiefly by preparations for ho&s;tility, or defence. Penrith is the mo&s;t &s;outhern town in England at which the guinea notes of the Scotch bank are in circulation. The beacon, a &s;ort of &s;quare tower, with a peaked roof and openings at the &s;ides, is a more perfect in&s;tance of the direful nece&s;&s;ities of pa&s;t ages, than would be expected to remain in this. The circum&s;tances are well known, which made &s;uch watchfulne&s;s e&s;pecially proper, at Penrith; and the other traces of warlike habits and precautions, whether appearing in records, or buildings, are too numerous to be noticed in a &s;ketch, which rather pretends to de&s;cribe what the author has &s;een, than to enumerate what has been di&s;covered by the re&s;earches of others. Dr. Burn's Hi&s;tory contains many curious particulars; and there are otherwi&s;e abundant

<PB N="434" REF="442">
and &s;atisfactory memorials, as to the &s;tate of the debateable ground, the regulations for &s;ecuring pa&s;&s;es or fords, and even to the public maintenance of &s;lough dogs, which were to pur&s;ue aggre&s;&s;ors with hot trod, as the inhabitants were to follow them by horn and voice. The&s;e are all te&s;timonies, that among the many evils, inflicted upon countries by war, that, which is not commonly thought of, is not the lea&s;t; the public encouragement of a di&s;po&s;ition to violence, under the names of gallantry, or valour, which will not cea&s;e exactly when it is publicly prohibited; and the education of nume|rous bodies to habits of &s;upplying their wants, not by con&s;tant and u&s;eful labour, but by &s;udden and de&s;tructive exertions of force. The mi&s;take, by which courage is relea&s;ed from all moral e&s;timation of the purpo&s;es, for which it is exerted, and is con&s;idered to be nece&s;&s;arily and univer&s;ally a good in it&s;elf, rather than a means of good, or of evil, according to its application, is among the &s;evere&s;t misfortunes of mankind. Tacitus has an admirable reproof of it&mdash;

<P>Though the &s;ituation of Penrith, looking up the vales of Eden and Emont, is remarkably plea&s;ant, that of the beacon above is infinitely finer, commanding an horizon of at lea&s;t an hundred miles diameter, filled with an endle&s;s variety of beauty, greatne&s;s and &s;ublimity. The view extends over Cumberland, parts of We&s;tmoreland, Lanca&s;hire, York&s;hire, and a corner of Northumberland and Durham. On a

clear day, the Scotti&s;h high lands, beyond Solway Firth, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, like faint clouds, on the horizon, and the &s;teeples of Carli&s;le are plainly vi&s;ible. All the intervening country, &s;peckled with towns and villages, is &s;pread beneath the eye, and, nearly eighty miles to the ea&s;tward, part of the Cheviot-hills are traced, a dark line, binding the di&s;tance and marking the &s;eparation between earth and &s;ky. On the plains towards Carli&s;le, the nearer ridges of Cro&s;s-fell are &s;een to commence, and thence &s;tretch their barren &s;teeps thirty miles towards the ea&s;t, where they di&s;appear among the Stainmore|hills and the huge moorlands of York&s;hire, that clo&s;e up the long land&s;cape of the vale of Eden. Among the&s;e, the broken lines of Ingleborough &s;tart above all the broader ones of the moors, and that mountain &s;till proclaims it&s;elf &s;overeign of the York&s;hire heights.</P>
<P>Southward, ri&s;e the wonders of We&s;tmoreland, Shapfells, ridge over ridge, the nearer pikes of Haw&s;water, and then the mountains of Ull&s;water, Helvellyn pre-eminent among&s;t them, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the grandeur and boldne&s;s of their outline, as well as the variety of their &s;hapes; &s;ome hugely &s;welling, &s;ome a&s;piring in clu&s;ters of alpine points, and &s;ome broken into &s;haggy ridges. The &s;ky, we&s;t|ward from hence and far to the north, di&s;plays a vi&s;ion of Alps, Saddleback &s;preading towards Ke&s;wick its long &s;hattered ridge, and one top of Skiddaw peering beyond it; but the others of this di&s;trict are inferior in grandeur to the fells of Ull&s;water, more broken into points, and with le&s;s of contra&s;t in their forms. Behind Saddleback, the &s;kirts of Skiddaw &s;pread them&s;elves, and thence low hills &s;helve

into the plains of Cumberland, that extend to Whitehaven; the only level line in the &s;cope of this va&s;t horizon. The &s;cenery nearer to the eye exhibited cultivation in its riche&s;t &s;tate, varied with pa&s;toral and &s;ylvan beauty; land&s;capes embelli&s;hed by the elegancies of art, and rendered venerable by the ruins of time. In the vale of Eden, Carleton-hall, flouri&s;hing under the hand of careful attention, and Bird's Ne&s;t, luxuriant in its &s;piry woods, oppo&s;ed their cheerful beauties to the neglected walls of Brougham Ca&s;tle, once the terror, and, even in ruins, the pride of the &s;cene, now half-&s;hrouded in its melancholy grove. The&s;e objects were lighted up by partial gleams of &s;un&s;hine, which, as they fled along the valley, gave magical effect to all they touched.</P>
<P>The other vales in the home pro&s;pect were tho&s;e of Bampton and Emont; the fir&s;t open and gentle, &s;haded by the gradual woods of Lowther-park; the la&s;t clo&s;er and more romantic, withdrawing in many a lingering bend towards Ull&s;water, where it is clo&s;ed by the pyramidal Dunmallard, but not before a gleam of the lake is &s;uffered to appear beyond the dark ba&s;e of the hill. At the nearer end of the vale, and immediately under the eye, the venerable ruins of Penrith Ca&s;tle cre&s;t a round green hill. The&s;e are of pale-red &s;tone, and &s;tand in detached ma&s;&s;es; but have little that is picture&s;que in their ap|pearance, time having &s;pared neither tower, or gateway, and not a &s;ingle tree giving &s;hade, or force, to the &s;hattered walls. The ground about the ca&s;tle is broken into gra&s;&s;y knolls, and only cattle wander over the de&s;olated tract. Time has al&s;o ob&s;cured the name of the

founder; but it is known, that the main building was repaired, and &s;ome addition made to it by Richard the Third, when Duke of Glouce&s;ter, who lived here, for five years, in his office of &s;heriff of Cumberland, promoting the York intere&s;t by artful ho&s;pitalities, and endeavouring to &s;trike terror into the Lanca&s;trians. Among the ruins is a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, leading to a hou&s;e in Penrith, above three hundred yards di&s;tant, called Dockwray Ca&s;tle. The town lies between the fortre&s;s and the Beacon-hill, &s;preading prettily along the &s;kirts of the mountain, with its many roofs of blue &s;late, among which the church ri&s;es near a dark grove.</P>
<P>Penrith, from the latter end of the la&s;t century, till lately, when it was purcha&s;ed by the Duke of Devon&s;hire, belonged to the family of Portland, to whom it was given by William the Third; probably in&s;tead of the manors in Wales, which it was one of William's few faulty de&s;igns to have given to his favourite companion, had not Par|liament remon&s;trated, and informed him, that the Crown could not alienate the territories of the Principality. The church, a building of red &s;tone, unu&s;ually well di&s;po&s;ed in the interior, is a vicarage of &s;mall endowment; but the value of money in this part of the king|dom is &s;o high, that the merit of independence, a merit and a hap|pine&s;s which &s;hould always belong to clergymen, is attainable by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of very moderate incomes. What is called the Giant's Grave in the church yard is a narrow &s;pot, inclo&s;ed, to the length of fourteen or fifteen feet, by rows of low &s;tones, at the &s;ides, and, at the ends, by two pillars, now &s;lender, but apparently worn by the
<PB N="438" REF="446">
weather from a greater thickne&s;s. The height of the&s;e is eleven or twelve feet; and all the &s;tones, whether in the borders, at the &s;ides, or in the&s;e pillars, bear traces of rude carving, which &s;hew, at lea&s;t, that the monument mu&s;t have been thought very important by tho&s;e that rai&s;ed it, &s;ince the &s;ingularity of its &s;ize was not held a &s;ufficient di&s;tinction. We pored intently over the&s;e traces, though certainly without the hope of di&s;covering any thing not known to the eminent antiquarians, who have confe&s;&s;ed their ignorance concerning the ori|gin of them.</P>

<HEAD>FROM PENRITH TO KESWICK.</HEAD>
<P>THE Gray&s;tock road, which we took for the fir&s;t five or &s;ixmiles, is unintere&s;ting, and offers nothing worthy of attention, before the approach to the ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of the Duke of Norfolk. The appearance of this from the road is good; a gray building, with gothic towers, &s;eated in a valley among lawns and woods, that &s;tretch, with great pomp of &s;hade, to gently-ri&s;ing hills. Behind the&s;e, Sad|dleback, huge, gray and barren, ri&s;es with all its ridgy lines; a grand and &s;imple back-ground, giving exqui&s;ite effect to the dark woods below. Such is the height of the mountain, that, though eight or ten miles off, it appeared, as we approached the ca&s;tle, almo&s;t to impend over it. Southward from Saddleback, a multitude
<PB N="439" REF="447">
of pointed &s;ummits crowd the horizon; and it is mo&s;t intere&s;ting, after leaving Gray&s;tock, to ob&s;erve their changing attitudes, as you advance, and the gradual di&s;clo&s;ure of their larger features. Perhaps, a &s;udden di&s;play of the &s;ublime&s;t &s;cenery, however full, imparts le&s;s emotion, than a gradually increa&s;ing view of it; when expectation takes the highe&s;t tone, and imagination fini&s;hes the &s;ketch.</P>
<P>About two miles beyond Gray&s;tock, the moorlands commence, and, as far as &s;imple greatne&s;s con&s;titutes &s;ublimity, this was, indeed, a &s;ublime pro&s;pect; le&s;s &s;o only than that from Shapfell it&s;elf, where the mountains are not &s;o varied in their forms and are plainer in their grandeur. We were on a va&s;t plain, if plain that may be called, which &s;wells into long undulations, &s;urrounded by an amphitheatre of heathy mountains, that &s;eem to have been &s;hook by &s;ome grand convul&s;ion of the earth, and tumbled around in all &s;hapes. Not a tree, a hedge, and &s;eldom even a &s;tone wall, broke the grandeur of their lines; what was not heath was only rock and gray crags; and a &s;hepherd's hut, or his flocks, brow&s;ing on the &s;teep &s;ides of the fells, or in the narrow vallies, that opened di&s;tantly, was all that diver&s;ified the va&s;t &s;cene. Saddleback &s;pread his &s;kirts we&s;tward along the plain, and then reared him&s;elf in terrible and lonely maje&s;ty. In the long per&s;pective beyond, were the crowding points of the fells round Ke&s;wick, Borrowdale, and the vales of St. John and Leyberthwaite, &s;tretching away to tho&s;e near Gra&s;mere. The weather was in &s;olemn harmony with the &s;cenery; long &s;hadows &s;wept over the hills, fol|lowed by gleaming lights. Tempe&s;tuous gu&s;ts alone broke the
<PB N="440" REF="448">
&s;ilence. Now and then, the &s;un's rays had a &s;ingular appearance; pouring, from under clouds, between the tops of fells into &s;ome deep vale, at a di&s;tance, as into a focus.</P>
<P>This is the very region, which the wild fancy of a poet, like Shake|&s;peare, would people with witches, and &s;hew them at their incanta|tions, calling &s;pirits from the clouds and &s;pectres from the earth.</P>
<P>On the now lonely plains of this va&s;t amphitheatre, the Romans had two camps, and their Eagle &s;pread its wings over a &s;cene worthy of its own &s;oarings. The lines of the&s;e encampments may &s;till be traced on that part of the plain, called Hutton Moor, to the north of the high road; and over its whole extent towards Ke&s;wick a Roman way has been di&s;covered. Funereal urns have al&s;o been dug up here, and an altar of Roman form, but with the in&s;cription obliterated.</P>
<P>Nearer Saddleback, we perceived crags and heath mingling on its precipices, and its ba&s;e broken into a little world of mountains, green with cultivation. White farms, each with its grove to &s;helter it from the de&s;cending gu&s;ts, corn and pa&s;tures of the brighte&s;t verdure enlivened the &s;kirts of the mountain all round, climbing to|wards the dark heath and crags, or &s;preading downwards into the vale of Threlkeld, where the &s;lender Lowther &s;hews his &s;hining &s;tream.</P>
<P>Leaving Hutton Moor, the road &s;oon began to a&s;cend the &s;kirts of Saddleback, and pa&s;&s;ed between green hillocks, where cattle ap|peared mo&s;t elegantly in the mountain &s;cene, under the crags, or &s;ipping at the clear &s;tream, that gu&s;hed from the rocks, and wound
<PB N="441" REF="449">
to the vale below. Such cry&s;tal rivulets cro&s;&s;ed our way continually, as we ro&s;e upon the &s;ide of Saddleback, which towers abruptly on the right, and, on the left, &s;inks as &s;uddenly into the vale of Threl|keld, with precipices &s;ometimes little le&s;s than tremendous. This mountain is the northern boundary of the vale in its whole length to Ke&s;wick, the points of who&s;e fells clo&s;e the per&s;pective. Rocky heights guard it to the &s;outh. The valley between is green, with|out wood, and, with much that is grand, has little beautiful, till near its conclu&s;ion; where, more fertile and &s;till more wild, it di|vides into three narrower vallies, two of which di&s;clo&s;e &s;cenes of &s;uch &s;ublime &s;everity as even our long view of Saddleback had not pre|pared us to expect.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the vale of St. John, a narrow, cultivated &s;pot, lying in the bo&s;om of tremendous rocks, that impend over it in ma&s;&s;es of gray crag, and often re&s;emble the ruins of ca&s;tles. The&s;e rocks are overlooked by &s;till more awful mountains, that fall in abrupt lines, and clo&s;e up the vi&s;ta, except where they al&s;o are com|manded by the va&s;t top of Helvellyn. On every &s;ide, are images of de&s;olation and &s;tupendous greatne&s;s, clo&s;ing upon a narrow line of pa&s;toral richne&s;s; a picture of verdant beauty, &s;een through a frame of rock work. It is between the cliffs of Threlkeld-fell and the purple ridge of Nadale-fell, that this vale &s;eems to repo&s;e in its mo&s;t &s;ilent and perfect peace. No village and &s;carcely a cottage di&s;|turbs its retirement. The flocks, that feed at the feet of the cliffs, and the &s;teps of a &s;hepherd, <Q REND="inline">"in this office of his mountain watch,"</Q> are all, that haunt the <Q REND="inline">"dark &s;eque&s;tered nook."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="450">
The vale of Nadale runs parallel with that of St. John, from which it is &s;eparated by the ridge of Nadale-fell, and has the &s;ame &s;tyle of character, except that it is terminated by a well wooded mountain. Beyond this, the per&s;pective is overlooked by the fells, that terminate the vale of St. John.</P>
<P>The third valley, opening from the head of Threlkeld, winds along the feet of Saddleback and Skiddaw to Ke&s;wick, the approach to which, with all its world of rocky &s;ummits, the lake being &s;till &s;unk below the &s;ight, is &s;ublime beyond the power of de&s;cription. Within three miles of Ke&s;wick, Skiddaw unfolds it&s;elf, clo&s;e behind Saddleback; their &s;kirts unite, but the former is le&s;s huge and of very different form from the la&s;t; being more pointed and &s;el|domer broken into precipices, it darts upward with a va&s;t &s;weep into three &s;piry &s;ummits, two of which only are &s;een from this road, and &s;hews &s;ides dark with heath and little varied with rock. Such is its a&s;pect from the Penrith road; from other &s;tations its atti|tude, &s;hape and colouring are very different, though its alpine ter|minations are always vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Threlkeld it&s;elf is a &s;mall village, about thirteen miles from Pen|rith, with a very humble inn, at which tho&s;e, who have pa&s;&s;ed the bleak &s;ides of Saddleback, and tho&s;e, who are entering upon them, may rejoice to re&s;t. We had been blown about, for &s;ome hours, in an open chai&s;e, and hoped for more refre&s;hment than could be obtain|ed; but had the &s;atisfaction, which was, indeed, general in the&s;e regions, of ob&s;erving the good intentions, amounting almo&s;t to kindne&s;s, of the
<PB N="443" REF="451">
cottagers towards their gue&s;ts. They have nearly always &s;ome fare, which le&s;s civility than theirs might render acceptable; and the hearth blazes in their clean &s;anded parlours, within two minutes after you enter them. Some &s;ort of pre&s;erved fruit is con&s;tantly ferved after the repa&s;t, with cream, an innocent luxury, for which no animal has died.</P>
<P>It is not only from tho&s;e, who are to gain by &s;trangers, but from almo&s;t every per&s;on, accidentally acco&s;ted by a que&s;tion, that this fa|vourable opinion will be formed, as to the kind and frank manners of the people. We were continually remarking, between Lanca&s;ter and Ke&s;wick, that &s;evere as the winter might be in the&s;e di&s;tricts, from the early &s;ymptoms of it then apparent, the conduct of the people would render it &s;carcely unplea&s;ant to take the &s;ame journey in the depths of December.</P>
<P>In the&s;e countries, the farms are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;mall, and the farmers and their children work in the &s;ame fields with their &s;er|vants. Their families have thus no opportunities of temporary in|&s;ight into the &s;ociety, and luxuries of the great, and have none of tho&s;e mi&s;eries, which dejected vanity and multiplied wi&s;hes inflict upon the pur&s;uers of the higher ranks. They are al&s;o without the ba&s;ene&s;s, which &s;uch pur&s;uers u&s;ually have, of becoming abject be|fore per&s;ons of one cla&s;s, that by the authority of an apparent con|nection with them, they may be in&s;olent to tho&s;e of another; and are free from the e&s;&s;ential humiliation of &s;hewing, by a general and undi&s;tingui&s;hing admiration of all per&s;ons richer than them&s;elves,
<PB N="444" REF="452">
that the original di&s;tinctions between virtue and vice have been era&s;ed from their minds by the habit of comparing the high and the low.</P>
<P>The true con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of independence, which labour and an ig|norance of the vain appendages, fal&s;ely called luxuries, give to the inhabitants of the&s;e di&s;tricts, is probably the cau&s;e of the &s;uperiority, perceived by &s;trangers in their tempers and manners, over tho&s;e of per&s;ons, apparently better circum&s;tanced. They have no remem|brance of &s;lights, to be revenged by in&s;ults; no hopes from &s;ervility, nor irritation from the de&s;ire of unattainable di&s;tinctions. Where, on the contrary, the encouragement of artificial wants has produced dependence, and mingled with the fictitious appearance of wealth many of the mo&s;t real evils of poverty, the benevolence of the tem|per flies with the &s;implicity of the mind. There is, perhaps, not a more odious pro&s;pect of human &s;ociety, than where an o&s;tenta|tious, manoeuvring and corrupted pea&s;antry, taking tho&s;e, who in|duce them to crimes, for the models of their morality, mimic the vices, to which they were not born, and attempt the coar&s;e cover|ing of cunning and in&s;olence for practices, which it is a &s;cience and frequently an object of education to conceal by flagitious elegancies. Such per&s;ons form in the country a bad copy of the wor&s;t London &s;ociety; the vices, without the intelligence, and without the a&s;&s;uag|ing virtues.</P>

<HEAD>DRUIDICAL MONUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing the very &s;mall, but neatly furni&s;hed church of Threlkeld, the condition of which may be one te&s;timony to the worthine&s;s of the neighbourhood, and ri&s;ing beyond the vales before de&s;cribed, we came to the brow of a hill, called Ca&s;tle Rigg, on which, to the left of the road, are the remains of one of tho&s;e circular monuments, which, by general con&s;ent, are called Druids' Temples. This is formed of thirty-&s;even &s;tones, placed in a circle of about twenty-eight yards diameter, the large&s;t being not le&s;s than &s;even feet and a half high, which is double the height of the others. At the ea&s;tern part of this circle, and within it, &s;maller &s;tones are arranged in an oblong of about &s;even yards long, and, at the greate&s;t breadth, four yards wide. Many of tho&s;e round the circle appear to have fallen and now remain at unequal di&s;tances, of which the greate&s;t is towards the north.</P>
<P>Whether our judgment was influenced by the authority of a Druid's choice, or that the place it&s;elf commanded the opinion, we thought this &s;ituation the mo&s;t &s;everely grand of any hitherto pa&s;&s;ed. There is, perhaps, not a &s;ingle object in the &s;cene, that interrupts the &s;olemn tone of feeling, impre&s;&s;ed by its general characters of profound &s;olitude, greatne&s;s and awful wildne&s;s. Ca&s;tle Rigg is the central point of three vallies, that dart immediately under it from the eye, and who&s;e mountains form part of an amphitheatre, which
<PB N="446" REF="454">
is completed by tho&s;e of Derwentwater, in the we&s;t, and by the pre|cipices of Skiddaw and Saddleback, clo&s;e on the north. The hue, which pervades all the&s;e mountains, is that of dark heath, or rock; they are thrown into every form and direction, that Fancy would &s;ugge&s;t, and are at that di&s;tance, which allows all their grandeur to prevail; nearer than the high lands, that &s;urround Hutton Moor, and further removed than the fells in the &s;cenery of Ull&s;water.</P>
<P>To the &s;outh open the rocks, that di&s;clo&s;e the vale of St. John, who&s;e verdant beauty bears no proportion to its &s;ublimity; to the we&s;t, are piled the &s;hattered and fanta&s;tic points of Derwentwater; to the north, Skiddaw, with its double top, re&s;embling a volcano, the cloudy vapours a&s;cending from its highe&s;t point, like &s;moke, and &s;ometimes rolling in wreaths down its &s;ides; and to the ea&s;t, the vale of Threlkeld, &s;preading green round the ba&s;e of Saddleback, its va&s;t &s;ide-&s;kreen, opened to the moorlands, beyond which the ridge of Cro&s;s-fell appeared; its dignity now dimini&s;hed by di&s;tance. This point then is &s;urrounded by the three grand rivals of Cumberland; huge Helvellyn, &s;preading Saddleback and &s;piry Skiddaw.</P>
<P>Such &s;eclu&s;ion and &s;ublimity were, indeed, well &s;uited to the deep and wild my&s;teries of the Druids. Here, at moon-light, every Druid, &s;ummoned by that terrible horn, never awakened but upon high occa&s;ions, and de&s;cending from his mountain, or &s;ecret cave, might a&s;&s;emble without intru&s;ion from one &s;acrilegious foot&s;tep, and celebrate a midnight fe&s;tival by a &s;avage &s;acrifice&mdash;<Q><PB N="447" REF="455">

<L>As, done in open day, would dim the &s;un,</L>

<L>Of earth, of water, nay of heav'n it&s;elf,</L>
<L>Do li&s;ten to their lay; and oft, 'tis &s;aid,</L>
<L>In vi&s;ible &s;hapes, dance they a magic round</L>
<L>To the high min&s;trel&s;y."</L></Q></P>
<P>As we de&s;cended the &s;teep mountain to Ke&s;wick, the romantic fells round the lake opened finely, but the lake it&s;elf was concealed, deep in its rocky cauldron. We &s;aw them under the la&s;t glow of &s;un-&s;et, the upward rays producing a mi&s;ty purple glory between the dark tops of Caw&s;ey-pikes and the bending peaks of Thornthwaite fells. Soon after, the &s;un having &s;et to the vale of Ke&s;wick, there appeared, beyond breaks in its we&s;tern mountains, the rocks of other vallies, &s;till lighted up by a purple gleam, and receiving &s;trong rays on &s;haggy points, to which their rece&s;&s;es gave &s;oft and &s;hadowy contra&s;t. But the magical effect of the&s;e &s;un&s;hine rocks, oppo&s;ed to the darkne&s;s of the nearer valley, can &s;carcely be imagined.</P>
<P>Still as we de&s;cended, the lake of Derwentwater was &s;creened from our view; but the rich level of three miles wide, that &s;preads between
<PB N="448" REF="456">
it and Ba&s;&s;enthwaite-water in the &s;ame vale, lay, like a map, beneath us, chequered with groves and cottages, with enclo&s;ures of corn and meadows, and adorned by the pretty village of Cro&s;sthwaite, its neat white church con&s;picuous among trees. The fanta&s;tic fells of Der|wentwater bordered this repo&s;ing land&s;cape, on the we&s;t, and the mighty Skiddaw ro&s;e over it, on the ea&s;t, concealing the lake of Ba&s;&s;enthwaite.</P>
<P>The hollow da&s;hings of the Greta, in its rocky channel, at the foot of Skiddaw, and in one of the mo&s;t wizard little glens that nature ever fancied, were heard long before we looked down its &s;teep woody bank, and &s;aw it winding away, from clo&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible cha&s;ms, to the vale of Ke&s;wick, corn and meadows &s;pread at the top of the left bank, and the crags of Skiddaw &s;cowling over it, on the right.</P>
<P>At length, we had a glimp&s;e of the north end of Derwent|water, and &s;oon after entered Ke&s;wick, a &s;mall place of &s;tone hou&s;es, lying at the foot of Ca&s;tle Rigg, near Skiddaw, and about a quar|ter of a mile from the lake, which, however, is not &s;een from the town.</P>
<P>We were impatient to view this celebrated lake, and immediately walked down to Crow-park, a green eminence at its northern end, whence it is generally allowed to appear to great advantage. Expec|tation had been rai&s;ed too high: Shall we own our di&s;appointment? Prepared for &s;omething more than we had already &s;een, by what has been &s;o eloquently &s;aid of it, by the view of its va&s;t neighbourhood
<PB N="449" REF="457">
and the grandeur of its approach, the lake it&s;elf looked in&s;ignificant; and, however rude, or awful, its nearer rocks might have appeared, if &s;een unexpectedly, they were not in general &s;o va&s;t, or &s;o boldly outlined, as to retain a character of &s;ublimity from compari&s;on. Oppo&s;ed to the &s;imple maje&s;ty of Ull&s;water, the lake of Derwent was &s;carcely intere&s;ting. Something mu&s;t, indeed, be attributed to the force of fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; but, with all allowance for this, Ull&s;water mu&s;t &s;till retain an high pre-eminence for grandeur and &s;ublimity.</P>
<P>Derwentwater, however, when more minutely viewed, has pecu|liar charms both from beauty and wildne&s;s, and as the emotions, excited by di&s;appointed expectation, began to &s;ub&s;ide, we became &s;en&s;ible of them. It &s;eems to be nearly of a round form, and the whole is &s;een at one glance, expanding within an amphitheatre of mountains, rocky, but not va&s;t, broken into many fanta&s;tic &s;hapes, peaked, &s;plintered, impending, &s;ometimes pyramidal, opening by narrow vallies to the view of rocks, that ri&s;e immediately be|yond and are again overlooked by others. The precipices &s;eldom over&s;hoot the water, but are arranged at &s;ome di&s;tance, and the &s;hores &s;well with woody eminences, or &s;ink into green, pa&s;toral margins. Ma&s;&s;es of wood al&s;o frequently appear among the cliffs, feathering them to their &s;ummits, and a white cottage &s;ometimes peeps from out their &s;kirts, &s;eated on the &s;mooth knoll of a pa&s;ture, projecting to the lake, and looks &s;o exqui&s;itely picture&s;que, as to &s;eem placed there purpo&s;ely to adorn it. The lake in return faithfully reflects
<PB N="450" REF="458">
the whole picture, and &s;o even and brilliantly tran&s;lucent is its &s;ur|face, that it rather heightens, than ob&s;cures the colouring. Its mild bo&s;om is &s;potted by four &s;mall i&s;lands, of which tho&s;e called Lords' and St. Herbert's are well wooded, and adorn the &s;cene, but another is deformed by buildings, &s;tuck over it, like figures upon a twelfth|cake.</P>
<P>Beyond the head of the lake, and at a direct di&s;tance of three or four miles from Crow-park, the pa&s;s of Borrowdale opens, guarded by two piles of rock, the bolde&s;t in the &s;cene, overlooked by many rocky points, and, beyond all, by rude mountain tops which come partially and in glimp&s;es to the view. Among the mo&s;t &s;triking features of the ea&s;tern &s;hore are the woody cliffs of Lowdore; then, nearer to the eye, Wallow-crags, a title u&s;ed here as well as at Haw&s;|water, of dark brown rock, loo&s;ely impending; nearer &s;till, Ca&s;tle|hill, pyramidal and richly wooded to its point, the mo&s;t luxuriant feature of the land&s;cape. Caw&s;ey-pike, one of the mo&s;t remarkable rocks of the we&s;tern &s;hore, has its ridge &s;colloped into points as if with a row of corbells.</P>
<P>The cultivated vale of Newland &s;lopes upward from the lake between the&s;e and Thornthwaite fells. Northward, beyond Crow|park, ri&s;es Skiddaw; at its ba&s;e commences the beautiful level, that &s;preads to Ba&s;&s;enthwaite-water, where the rocks in the we&s;t &s;ide of the per&s;pective &s;oon begin to &s;often, and the vale becomes open and cheerful.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="459">
Such is the outline of Derwentwater, which has a much greater proportion of beauty, than Ull&s;water, but neither its dignity, nor grandeur. Its fells, broken into &s;maller ma&s;&s;es, do not &s;well, or &s;tart, into &s;uch bold lines as tho&s;e of Ull&s;water; nor does the &s;ize of the lake accord with the general importance of the rocky vale, in which it lies. The water is too &s;mall for its accompaniments; and its form, being round and &s;een entirely at once, leaves nothing for expectation to pur&s;ue, beyond the &s;tretching promontory, or fancy to transform within the gloom and ob&s;curity of the receding fell; and thus it lo&s;es an ample &s;ource of the &s;ublime. The greate&s;t breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t is not more than three miles. It is not large enough to occupy the eye, and it is not &s;o hidden as to have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ima|gination in making it appear large. The beauty of its banks al&s;o, contending with the wildne&s;s of its rocks, gives oppo&s;ite impre&s;&s;ions to the mind, and the force of each is, perhaps, de&s;troyed by the admi&s;&s;ion of the other. Sublimity can &s;carcely exi&s;t, without &s;impli|city; and even grandeur lo&s;es much of its elevating effect, when united with a con&s;iderable portion of beauty; then de&s;cending to become magnificence. The effect of &s;implicity in a&s;&s;i&s;ting that high tone of mind, produced by the &s;ublime, is demon&s;trated by the &s;cenery of Ull&s;water, where very &s;eldom a di&s;cordant object obtrudes over the cour&s;e of thought, and jars upon the feelings.</P>
<P>But it is much plea&s;anter to admire than to examine, and in Der|wentwater is abundant &s;ubject for admiration, though not of &s;o high a character as that, which attends Ull&s;water. The &s;oft undulations
<PB N="452" REF="460">
of its &s;hores, the mingled wood and pa&s;ture, that paint them, the brilliant purity of the water, that gives back every land&s;cape on its bank, and frequently with heightened colouring, the fanta&s;tic wild|ne&s;s of the rocks and the magnificence of the amphitheatre they form; the&s;e are circum&s;tances, the view of which excites emotions of &s;weet, though tranquil admiration, &s;oftening the mind to tenderne&s;s, rather than elevating it to &s;ublimity. We fir&s;t &s;aw the whole beneath &s;uch &s;ober hues as prevailed when<Q><L>"the gray hooded Even,</L>

<P>The wildne&s;s, &s;eclu&s;ion, and magical beauty of this vale, &s;eem, indeed, to render it the very abode for Milton's Comus, <Q REND="inline">"deep &s;killed in all his mother's witcheries;"</Q> and, while we &s;urvey its fanta&s;tic features, we are almo&s;t tempted to &s;uppo&s;e, that he has hurled his<Q><L>"dazzling &s;pells into the air,</L>

<HEAD>SKIDDAW.</HEAD>
<P>ON the following morning, having engaged a guide, and with hor&s;es accu&s;tomed to the labour, we began to a&s;cend this tre|mendous mountain by a way, which makes the &s;ummit five miles from Ke&s;wick. Pa&s;&s;ing through bowery lanes, luxuriant with moun|tain a&s;h, holly, and a variety of beautiful &s;hrubs, to a broad, open common, a road led us to the foot of Latrigg, or, as it is called by the country people, Skiddaw's Cub, a large round hill, covered with heath, turf and brow&s;ing &s;heep. A narrow path now wound along &s;teep green precipices, the beauty of which prevented what danger there was from being perceived. Derwentwater was concealed by others, that ro&s;e above them, but that part of the vale of Ke&s;wick,
<PB N="454" REF="462">
which &s;eparates the two lakes, and &s;preads a rich level of three miles, was immediately below; Cro&s;&s;thwaite-church, nearly in the centre, with the white vicarage, ri&s;ing among trees. More under &s;helter of Skiddaw, where the vale &s;preads into a &s;weet retired nook, lay the hou&s;e and grounds of Dr. Brownrigg.</P>
<P>Beyond the level, opened a glimp&s;e of Ba&s;&s;enthwaite-water; a lake, which may be called elegant, bounded, on one &s;ide, by well|wooded rocks, and, on the other, by Skiddaw.</P>
<P>Soon after, we ro&s;e above the &s;teeps, which had concealed Der|wentwater, and it appeared, with all its enamelled banks, &s;unk deep amid&s;t a chaos of mountains, and &s;urrounded by ranges of fells, not vi&s;ible from below. On the other hand, the more cheerful lake of Ba&s;&s;enthwaite expanded at its entire length. Having gazed a while on this magnificent &s;cene, we pur&s;ued the path, and &s;oon after reached the brink of a cha&s;m, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of which wound our future track; for the a&s;cent is here in an acutely zig-zag direc|tion. The hor&s;es carefully picked their &s;teps along the narrow precipice, and turned the angle, that led them to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>At length, as we a&s;cended, Derwentwater dwindled on the eye to the &s;mallne&s;s of a pond, while the grandeur of its amphitheatre was increa&s;ed by new ranges of dark mountains, no longer indivi|dually great, but &s;o from accumulation; a &s;cenery to give ideas of the breaking up of a world. Other precipices &s;oon hid it again, but Ba&s;|&s;enthwaite continued to &s;pread immediately below us, till we turned
<PB N="455" REF="463">
into the heart of Skiddaw, and were enclo&s;ed by its &s;teeps. We had now lo&s;t all track even of the flocks, that were &s;cattered over the&s;e tremendous wilds. The guide conducted us by many curvings among the heathy hills and hollows of the mountain; but the a&s;cents were &s;uch, that the hor&s;es panted in the &s;lowe&s;t walk, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to let them re&s;t every &s;ix or &s;even minutes. An opening to the &s;outh, at length, &s;hewed the whole plan of the narrow vales of St. John and of Nadale, &s;eparated by the dark ridge of rock, called St. John's-rigg, with each its &s;mall line of verdure at the bot|tom, and bounded by enormous gray fells, which we were, however, now high enough to overlook.</P>
<P>A white &s;peck, on the top of St. John's rigg, was pointed out by the guide to be a chapel of ea&s;e to Ke&s;wick, which has no le&s;s than five &s;uch &s;cattered among the fells. From this chapel, dedicated to St. John, the rock and the vale have received their name, and our guide told us, that Nadale was frequently known by the &s;ame title.</P>
<P>Leaving this view, the mountain &s;oon again &s;hut out all pro&s;pect, but of its own vallies and precipices, covered with various &s;hades of turf and mo&s;s, and with heath, of which a dull purple was the pre|vailing hue. Not a tree, or bu&s;h appeared on Skiddaw, nor even a &s;tone wall any where broke the &s;imple greatne&s;s of its lines. Some|times, we looked into tremendous cha&s;ms, where the torrent, heard roaring long before it was &s;een, had worked it&s;elf a deep channel, and fell from ledge to ledge, foaming and &s;hining amid&s;t the dark rock. The&s;e &s;treams are &s;ublime from the length and precipitancy
<PB N="456" REF="464">
of their cour&s;e, which, hurrying the &s;ight with them into the aby&s;s, act, as it were, in &s;ympathy upon the nerves, and, to &s;ave our|&s;elves from following, we recoil from the view with involuntary horror. Of &s;uch, however, we &s;aw only two, and tho&s;e by &s;ome departure from the u&s;ual cour&s;e up the mountain; but every where met gu&s;hing &s;prings, till we were within two miles of the &s;ummit, when our guide added to the rum in his bottle what he &s;aid was the la&s;t water we &s;hould find in our a&s;cent.</P>
<P>The air now became very thin, and the &s;teeps &s;till more difficult of a&s;cent; but it was often delightful to look down into the green hollows of the mountain, among pa&s;toral &s;cenes, that wanted only &s;ome mixture of wood to render them enchanting.</P>
<P>About a mile from the &s;ummit, the way was, indeed, dread|fully &s;ublime, laying, for nearly half a mile, along the ledge of a precipice, that pa&s;&s;ed, with a &s;wift de&s;cent, for probably near a mile, into a glen within the heart of Skiddaw; and not a bu&s;h, or a hil|lock interrupted its va&s;t length, or, by offering a midway check in the de&s;cent, dimini&s;hed the &s;ear it in&s;pired. The ridgy &s;teeps of Saddleback formed the oppo&s;ite boundary of the glen, and, though really at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, had, from the height of the two mountains, &s;uch an appearance of nearne&s;s, that it almo&s;t &s;eemed as if we could &s;pring to its &s;ide. How much too did &s;implicity in|crea&s;e the &s;ublime of this &s;cenery, in which nothing but mountain, heath and &s;ky appeared.</P>
<P>But our &s;ituation was too critical, or too unu&s;ual, to permit the
<PB N="457" REF="465">
ju&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch &s;ublimity. The hill ro&s;e &s;o clo&s;ely above the precipice as &s;carcely to allow a ledge wide enough for a &s;ingle hor&s;e. We followed the guide in &s;ilence, and, till we regained the more open wild, had no lei&s;ure for exclamation. After this, the a&s;cent appeared ea&s;y and &s;ecure, and we were bold enough to won|der, that the &s;teeps near the beginning of the mountain had excited any anxiety.</P>
<P>At length, pa&s;&s;ing the &s;kirts of the two points of Skiddaw, which are neare&s;t to Derwentwater, we approached the third and loftie&s;t, and then perceived, that their &s;teep &s;ides, together with the ridges, which connect them, were entirely covered near the &s;ummits with a whiti&s;h &s;hivered &s;late, which threatens to &s;lide down them with every gu&s;t of wind. The broken &s;tate of this &s;late makes the pre&s;ent &s;ummits &s;eem like the ruins of others; a circum&s;tance as extraordinary in ap|pearance as difficult to be accounted for.</P>
<P>The ridge, on which we pa&s;&s;ed from the neighbourhood of the &s;econd &s;ummit to the third, was narrow, and the eye reached, on each &s;ide, down the whole extent of the mountain, following, on the left, the rocky precipices, that impend over the lake of Ba&s;&s;en|thwaite, and looking, on the right, into the glens of Saddleback, far, far below. But the pro&s;pects, that bur&s;t upon us from every part of the va&s;t horizon, when we had gained the &s;ummit, were &s;uch as we had &s;carcely dared to hope for, and mu&s;t now rather venture to enumerate, than to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>We &s;tood on a pinnacle, commanding the whole dome of the
<PB N="458" REF="466">
&s;ky. The pro&s;pects below, each of which had been before con&s;i|dered &s;eparately as a great &s;cene, were now miniature parts of the immen&s;e land&s;cape. To the north, lay, like a map, the va&s;t tract of low country, which extends between Ba&s;&s;enthwaite and the Iri&s;h Channel, marked with the &s;ilver circles of the river Derwent, in its progre&s;s from the lake. Whitehaven and its white coa&s;t were di&s;tinctly &s;een, and Cockermouth &s;eemed almo&s;t under the eye. A long blacki&s;h line, more to the we&s;t, re&s;embling a faintly formed cloud, was &s;aid by the guide to be the I&s;le of Man, who, however, had the hone&s;ty to confe&s;s, that the mountains of Down in Ireland, which have been &s;ometimes thought vi&s;ible, had never been &s;een by him in the cleare&s;t weather.</P>
<P>Bounding the low country to the north, the wide Solway Firth, with its indented &s;hores, looked like a gray horizon, and the double range of Scotti&s;h mountains, &s;een dimly through mi&s;t beyond, like lines of dark clouds above it. The Solway appeared &s;urpri&s;ingly near us, though at fifty miles di&s;tance, and the guide &s;aid, that, on a bright day, its &s;hipping could plainly be di&s;cerned. Nearly in the north, the heights &s;eemed to &s;often into plains, for no object was there vi&s;ible through the ob&s;curity, that had begun to draw over the furthe&s;t di&s;tance; but, towards the ea&s;t, they appeared to &s;well again, and what we were told were the Cheviot hills dawned feebly beyond Northumberland. We now &s;panned the narrowe&s;t part of England, looking from the Iri&s;h Channel, on one &s;ide, to the German Ocean, on the other, which latter was, however, &s;o far off as to be di&s;cernible only like a mi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="467">
Nearer than the county of Durham, &s;tretched the ridge of Cro&s;s|fell, and an indi&s;tinct multitude of the We&s;tmoreland and York|&s;hire highlands, who&s;e lines di&s;appeared behind Saddleback, now evidently pre-eminent over Skiddaw, &s;o much &s;o as to exclude many a height beyond it. Pa&s;&s;ing this mountain in our cour&s;e to the &s;outh, we &s;aw, immediately below, the fells round Derwent|water, the lake it&s;elf remaining &s;till concealed in their deep rocky bo&s;om. Southward and we&s;tward, the whole pro&s;pect was a <Q REND="inline">"tur|bulent chaos of dark mountains."</Q> All individual dignity was now lo&s;t in the immen&s;ity of the whole, and every variety of character was overpowered by that of a&s;toni&s;hing and gloomy grandeur.</P>
<P>Over the fells of Borrowdale, and far to the &s;outh, the northern end of Windermere appeared, like a wreath of gray &s;moke, that &s;preads along the mountain's &s;ide. More &s;outhward &s;till, and be|yond all the fells of the lakes, Lanca&s;ter &s;ands extended to the faintly &s;een waters of the &s;ea. Then to the we&s;t, Duddon &s;ands gleamed in a long line among the fells of High Furne&s;s. Immediately under the eye, lay Ba&s;&s;enthwaite, &s;urrounded by many ranges of moun|tains, invi&s;ible from below. We overlooked all the&s;e dark mountains, and &s;aw green cultivated vales over the tops of lofty rocks, and other mountains over the&s;e vales in many ridges, whil&s;t innumerable nar|row glens were traced in all their windings and &s;een uniting behind the hills with others, that al&s;o &s;loped upwards from the lake.</P>
<P>The air on this &s;ummit was boi&s;terous, inten&s;ely cold and difficult to be in&s;pired, though the day was below warm and &s;erene. It was
<PB N="460" REF="468">
dreadful to look down from nearly the brink of the point, on which we &s;tood, upon the lake of Ba&s;&s;enthwaite and over a &s;harp and &s;e|parated ridge of rocks, that from below appeared of tremendous height, but now &s;eemed not to reach half way up Skiddaw; it was almo&s;t as if
<Q><L>"the precipitation might down &s;tretch</L>
<L>Below the beam of &s;ight."</L></Q></P>
<P>Under the lee of an heaped up pile of &s;lates, formed by the cu&s;|tomary contribution of one from every vi&s;itor, we found an old man &s;heltered, whom we took to be a &s;hepherd, but afterwards learned was a farmer and, as the people in this neighbourhood &s;ay, a <Q REND="inline">'&s;tate&s;|man;'</Q> that is, had land of his own. He was a native and &s;till an inhabitant of an adjoining vale; but, &s;o laborious is the enterpri&s;e reckoned, that, though he had pa&s;&s;ed his life within view of the mountain, this was his fir&s;t a&s;cent. He de&s;cended with us, for part of our way, and then wound off towards his own valley, &s;talking amid&s;t the wild &s;cenery, his large figure wrapt in a dark cloak and his &s;teps occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a long iron pronged pike, with which he had pointed out di&s;tant objects.</P>
<P>In the de&s;cent, it was intere&s;ting to ob&s;erve each mountain below gradually re-a&s;&s;uming its dignity, the two lakes expanding into &s;pa|cious &s;urfaces, the many little vallies, that &s;loped upwards from their margins, recovering their variegated tints of cultivation, the cattle again appearing in the meadows, and the woody promontories
<PB N="461" REF="469">
changing from &s;mooth patches of &s;hade into richly tufted &s;ummits. At about a mile from the top, a great difference was perceptible in the climate, which became comparatively warm, and the &s;ummer hum of bees was again heard among the purple heath.</P>
<P>We reached Ke&s;wick, about four o'clock, after five hours pa&s;&s;ed in this excur&s;ion, in which the care of our guide greatly le&s;&s;ened the notion of danger. Why &s;hould we think it trivial to attempt &s;ome &s;ervice towards this poor man? We have rea&s;on to think, that whoever employs, at Ke&s;wick, a guide of the name of Donca&s;ter, will a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;upporting an aged parent.</P>

<HEAD>BASSENTHWAITE WATER.</HEAD>
<P>IN a gray autumnal morning, we rode out along the we&s;tern bank of Ba&s;&s;enthwaite to Ou&s;e Bridge, under which the river Derwent, after pa&s;&s;ing through the lake, takes its cour&s;e towards the Sea. The road on this &s;ide, being impa&s;&s;able by carriages, is &s;el|dom vi&s;ited, but it is intere&s;ting for being oppo&s;ed to Skiddaw, which ri&s;es in new attitudes over the oppo&s;ite bank. Beyond the land, that &s;eparates the two lakes, the road runs high along the &s;ides of hills and &s;ometimes at the feet of tremendous fells, one of which ri&s;es almo&s;t &s;pirally over it, &s;hewing a &s;urface of &s;lates, &s;hivered from top to bottom. Further on, the heights gradually &s;often from horror into mild and graceful beauty, opening di&s;tantly to the cheerful
<PB N="462" REF="470">
country, that &s;preads towards Whitehaven; but the road &s;oon im|merges among woods, which allow only partial views of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, inimitably beautiful with cop&s;es, green lawns and pa&s;tures, with gently &s;weeping promontories and bays, that receive the lake to their full brims.</P>
<P>From the hou&s;e at Ou&s;e Bridge the pro&s;pect is exqui&s;ite up the lake, which now lo&s;ing the air of a wide river, re-a&s;&s;umes its true character, and even appears to flow into the cha&s;m of rocks, that really inclo&s;e Derwentwater. Skiddaw, with all the mountains round Borrowdale, form a magnificent amphitheatrical per&s;pective for this noble &s;heet of water; the vallies of the two lakes extending to one view, which is, therefore, &s;uperior to any exhibited from Derwentwater alone. The pro&s;pect terminates in the dark fells of Borrowdale, which by their &s;ublimity enhance the beauty and ele|gance, united to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree in the nearer land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Beyond Ou&s;e Bridge, but &s;till at the bottom of the lake, the road pa&s;&s;es before Armithwaite-hou&s;e, who&s;e cop&s;y lawns &s;lope to the mar|gin of the water from a man&s;ion more finely &s;ituated than any we had &s;een. It then recedes &s;omewhat from the bank, and a&s;cends the &s;kirt of Skiddaw, which it &s;carcely leaves on this &s;ide of Ke&s;wick. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, the mo&s;t elegant features are the &s;welling hills, called Wythop-brows, flouri&s;hing with wood from the water's edge; and, below the meadows of the ea&s;tern bank, by which we were returning, two penin&s;ulae, the one pa&s;toral, yet well wooded and embelli&s;hed by a white hamlet, the other narrow and bearing
<PB N="463" REF="471">
only a line of trees, i&s;&s;uing far into the lake. But the &s;hores of Ba&s;|&s;enthwaite, though elegant and often beautiful, are too little varied to be long dwelt upon; and attention is &s;ometimes unplea&s;antly engaged by a precipice, from which the road is not &s;ufficiently &s;ecu|red; &s;o that the effect of the whole upon the imagination is much le&s;s than might be expected from its &s;ituation at the foot of Skiddaw, and its &s;hape, which is more extended than that of Derwentwater.</P>

<HEAD>BORROWDALE.</HEAD>
<P>A SERENE day, with gleams of &s;un&s;hine, gave magical effect to the &s;cenery of Derwentwater, as we wound along its ea&s;tern &s;hore to Borrowdale, under cliffs, parts of which, already fallen near the road, increa&s;ed the opinion of danger from the re&s;t; &s;ometimes near the edge of precipices, that bend over the water, and, at others, among plea&s;ure-grounds and cop&s;es, which admit partial views over the lake. The&s;e, with every woody promontory and mountain, were perfectly reflected on its &s;urface. Not a path-way, not a crag, or &s;car, that &s;culptured their bold fronts, but was copied and di&s;tinctly &s;een even from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore in the dark purple mirror below. Now and then, a plea&s;ure-boat glided by, leaving long &s;ilver lines, drawn to a point on the &s;mooth water, which, as it gave back the painted &s;ides and gleaming &s;ail, di&s;played a moving picture.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="472">
The colouring of the mountains was, this day, &s;urpri&s;ingly various and changeful, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing every thing of the &s;ame nature, that we had &s;een. The effect of the atmo&s;phere on mountainous regions is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;ublime, at others &s;o enchantingly beautiful, that the mention of it ought not to be con&s;idered as trivial, when their a&s;pect is to be de&s;cribed. As the &s;un-beams fell on different kinds of rock, and di&s;tance coloured the air, &s;ome parts were touched with lilac, others with light blue, dark purple, or reddi&s;h brown, which were often &s;een, at the &s;ame moment, contra&s;ting with the mellow green of the woods and the brightne&s;s of &s;un&s;hine; then &s;lowly and almo&s;t imperceptibly changing into other tints. Skiddaw it&s;elf exhibited much of this variety, during our ride. As we left Ke&s;wick, its points were over&s;pread with pale azure; on our return, a tint of dark blue &s;oftened its features, which were, however, &s;oon after involved in deepe&s;t purple.</P>
<P>Winding under the woods of Barrow&s;ide, we approached Low|dore, and heard the thunder of his cataract, joined by the &s;ounds of others, de&s;cending within the gloom of the nearer rocks and thickets. The retro&s;pective views over the lake from Barrow&s;ide are the fine&s;t in the ride; and, when the road emerges from the woods, a range of rocks ri&s;es over it, where many &s;hrubs, and even oaks, a&s;h, yew, grow in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner among the broken &s;lates, that cover their &s;ides. Beyond, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, appear the awful rocks, that ri&s;e over the fall of Lowdore; that on the right &s;hooting up, a va&s;t pyramid of naked cliff, above finely wooded
<PB N="465" REF="473">
&s;teeps; while, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the cha&s;m, that receives the waters, impends Gowdar-crag, who&s;e trees and &s;hrubs give only &s;haggine&s;s to its terrible ma&s;&s;es, with fragments of which the mea|dows below are &s;trewn. There was now little water at Lowdore; but the breadth of its channel and the height of the perpendicular rock, from which it leaps, told how tremendous it could be; yet even then its &s;ublimity is probably derived chiefly from the cliff and moun|tain, that tower clo&s;ely over it.</P>
<P>Here Borrowdale begins, its rocks &s;preading in a va&s;t &s;weep round the head of the lake, at the di&s;tance, perhaps, of half a mile from the &s;hore, which bears meadow land to the water's brink. The a&s;pect of the&s;e rocks, with the fragments, that have rolled from their &s;um|mits, and lie on each &s;ide of the road, prepared us for the &s;cene of tremendous ruin we were approaching in the gorge, or pa&s;s of Bor|rowdale, which opens from the centre of the amphitheatre, that binds the head of Derwentwater. Dark rocks yawn at its entrance, terrific as the wildne&s;s of a maniac; and di&s;clo&s;e a narrow pa&s;s, running up between mountains of granite, that are &s;hook into almo&s;t every po&s;|&s;ible form of horror. All above re&s;embles the accumulations of an earthquake; &s;plintered, &s;hivered, piled, ama&s;&s;ed. Huge cliffs have rolled down into the glen below, where, however, is &s;till a miniature of the &s;weete&s;t pa&s;toral beauty, on the banks of the river Derwent; but de&s;cription cannot paint either the wildne&s;s of the mountains, or the pa&s;toral and &s;ylvan peace and &s;oftne&s;s, that wind at their ba&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t &s;triking of the fells are Glaramara, &s;hewing
<PB N="466" REF="474">
rock on rock; and Eagle-crag, where, till lately, that bird built its ne&s;t; but the depredations, annually committed on its young, have driven it from the place. Hence we pur&s;ued the pa&s;s for a mile, over a frightful road, that climbs among the crags of a precipice above the river, having frequently glimp&s;es into glens and cha&s;ms, where all pa&s;&s;age &s;eemed to be ob&s;tructed by the fallen &s;hivers of rock, and at length reached the gigantic &s;tone of Bowther, that appears to have been pitched into the ground from the &s;ummit of a neighbouring fell, and is &s;haped, like the roof of a hou&s;e rever&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is one of the &s;pectacles of the country. Its &s;ize makes it impo&s;&s;ible to have been ever moved by human means; and, if it fell from the neare&s;t of the rocks, it mu&s;t have rolled upon the ground much further than can be readily conceived of the motion of &s;uch a ma&s;s. The &s;ide towards the road projects about twelve feet over the ba&s;e, and &s;erves to &s;helter cattle in a penn, of which it is made to form one boundary. A &s;mall oak plant and a &s;loe have found &s;oil enough to flouri&s;h in at the top; and the ba&s;e is pitched on a cliff over the river, whence a long per&s;pective of the gorge is &s;een, with a little level of bright verdure, &s;preading among more di&s;tant fells and winding away into trackle&s;s regions, where the mountains lift their ruffian heads in undi&s;puted authority. Below, the &s;hrunk Derwent &s;er|pentized along a wide bed of pebbles, that marked its wintry cour&s;e, and left a wooded i&s;land, flouri&s;hing amid&s;t the wa&s;te. The &s;tillne&s;s around us was only feebly broken by the remote &s;ounds of many un&s;een cataracts, and &s;ometimes by the voices of mountaineer chil|dren,
<PB N="467" REF="475">
&s;houting afar off, and plea&s;ing them&s;elves with rou&s;ing the echoes of the rocks.</P>
<P>In returning, the view opened, with great magnificence, from the jaws of this pa&s;s over the lake to Skiddaw, then &s;een from its ba&s;e, with the upper &s;teeps of Saddleback obliquely beyond, and rearing it&s;elf far above all the heights of the ea&s;tern &s;hore. At the entrance of the gorge, the village or hamlet of Grange lies picture&s;quely on the bank of the Derwent among wood and meadows, and &s;heltered under the ruinous fell, called Ca&s;tlecrag, that takes its name from the ca&s;tle, or fortre&s;s, which from its crown once guarded this important pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Borrowdale abounds in valuable mines, among which &s;ome are known to &s;upply the fine&s;t wadd, or black lead, to be found in Eng|land. Iron, &s;late, and free &s;tone of various kinds, are al&s;o the trea|&s;ures of the&s;e mountains.</P>

<HEAD>FROM KESWICK TO WINDERMERE.</HEAD>
<P>THE road from Ke&s;wick to Amble&s;ide commences by the a&s;cent of Ca&s;tle-rigg, the mountain, which the Penrith road de&s;cends, and which, on that &s;ide, is crowned by a Druid's temple. The ri&s;e is now very laborious, but the views it affords over the vale of Ke&s;wick are not dearly purcha&s;ed by the fatigue. All Ba&s;&s;en|thwaite, its mountains &s;oftening away in the per&s;pective, and termi|nating, on the we&s;t, in the &s;i&s;ter woods of Wythorp-brows, extends from the eye; and, immediately beneath, the northern end of Der|wentwater, with Caw&s;ey-pike, Thornthwaite-fell, the rich upland vale of Newland peeping from between their ba&s;es, and the &s;piry woods of Foepark jutting into the lake below. But the fine&s;t pro|&s;pect is from a gate about halfway up the hill, whence you look down upon the head of Derwentwater, with all the alps of Borrowdale, opening darkly.</P>
<P>After de&s;cending Ca&s;tle-rigg and cro&s;&s;ing the top of St. John's vale, we &s;eemed as if going into bani&s;hment from &s;ociety, the road then leading over a plain, clo&s;ely &s;urrounded by mountains &s;o wild, that neither a cottage, or a wood &s;often their rudene&s;s, and &s;o &s;teep and barren, that not even &s;heep appear upon their &s;ides. From this plain the road enters Legberthwaite, a narrow valley, running at the
<PB N="469" REF="477">
back of Borrowdale, green at the bottom, and varied with a few farms, but without wood, and with fells of gray precipices, ri&s;ing to great height and nearly perpendicular on either hand, who&s;e fronts are marked only by the torrents, that tumble from their utmo&s;t &s;um|mits, and perpetually occur. We often &s;topped to li&s;ten to their hol|low &s;ounds amid&s;t the &s;olitary greatne&s;s of the &s;cene, and to watch their headlong fall down the rocky cha&s;ms, their white foam and &s;il|ver line contra&s;ting with the dark hue of the clefts. In &s;ublimity of de&s;cent the&s;e were frequently much &s;uperior to that of Lowdore, but as much inferior to it in ma&s;s of water and picture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P>As the road a&s;cended towards Helvellyn, we looked back through this va&s;t rocky vi&s;ta to the &s;weet vale of St. John, lengthening the per&s;pective, and &s;aw, as through a tele&s;cope, the broad broken &s;teeps of Saddleback and the points of Skiddaw, darkly blue, clo&s;ing it to the north. The grand rivals of Cumberland were now &s;een toge|ther; and the road, &s;oon winding high over the &s;kirts of Helvellyn, brought us to Leathes-water, to which the mountain forms a va&s;t &s;ide-&s;kreen, during its whole length. This is a long, but narrow and unadorned lake, having little el&s;e than walls of rocky fells, &s;tart|ing from its margin. Continuing on the precipice, at &s;ome height from the &s;hore, the road brought us, after three miles, to the poor village of Wythburn, and &s;oon after to the foot of Dunmail Rays, which, though a con&s;iderable a&s;cent, forms the dip of two lofty mountains, Steel-fell and Seat Sandle, that ri&s;e with finely-&s;weeping lines, on each &s;ide, and &s;hut up the vale.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="478">
Beyond Dunmail Rays, one of the grand pa&s;&s;es from Cumberland into We&s;tmoreland, Helm-crag rears its cre&s;t, a &s;trange fanta&s;tic &s;um|mit, round, yet jagged and &s;plintered, like the wheel of a water-mill, overlooking Gra&s;mere, which, &s;oon after, opened below. A green &s;preading circle of mountains embo&s;oms this &s;mall lake, and, beyond, a wider range ri&s;es in amphitheatre, who&s;e rocky tops are rounded and &s;colloped, yet are great, wild, irregular, and were then over|&s;pread with a tint of faint purple. The &s;ofte&s;t verdure margins the water, and mingles with corn enclo&s;ures and woods, that wave up the hills; but &s;carcely a cottage any where appears, except at the northern end of the lake, where the village of Gra&s;mere and its very neat white church &s;tand among trees, near the &s;hore, with Helm|crag and a multitude of fells, ri&s;ing over it and beyond each other in the per&s;pective.</P>
<P>The lake was clear as gla&s;s, reflecting the headlong mountains, with every feature of every image on its tranquil banks; and one green i&s;land varies, but &s;carcely adorns its &s;urface, bearing only a rude and now &s;hadele&s;s hut. At a con&s;iderable height above the water, the road undulates for a mile, till, near the &s;outhern end of Gra&s;mere, it mounts the crags of a fell, and &s;eemed carrying us again into &s;uch &s;cenes of ruin and privation as we had quitted with Legberthwaite and Leathes-water. But, de&s;cending the other &s;ide of the mountain, we were &s;oon cheered by the view of plantations, enriching the banks of Rydal-water, and by thick woods, ming|ling among cliffs above the narrow lake, which winds through a
<PB N="471" REF="479">
clo&s;e valley, for about a mile. This lake is remarkable for the beauty of its &s;mall round i&s;lands, luxuriant with elegant trees and &s;hrubs, and who&s;e banks are green to the water's edge. Rydal-hall &s;tands finely on an eminence, &s;omewhat withdrawn from the ea&s;t end, in a clo&s;e romantic nook, among old woods, that feather the fells, which ri&s;e over their &s;ummits, and &s;pread widely along the neighbouring eminences. This antient white man&s;ion looks over a rough gra&s;&s;y de&s;cent, &s;creened by groves of oak and maje&s;tic planes, towards the head of Windermere, about two miles di&s;tant, a &s;mall glimp&s;e of which is caught beyond the wooded &s;teeps of a narrow valley. In the woods and in the di&s;po&s;ition of the ground round Rydal-hall there is a charming wildne&s;s, that &s;uits the character of the general &s;cene; and, wherever art appears, it is with graceful plainne&s;s and meek &s;ubjection to nature.</P>
<P>The ta&s;te, by which a ca&s;cade in the plea&s;ure-grounds, pouring under the arch of a rude bridge, amid&s;t the green tint of woods, is &s;hewn through a darkened garden-hou&s;e, and, therefore, with all the effect, which the oppo&s;ition of light and &s;hade can give, is even not too artificial; &s;o admirably is the intent accompli&s;hed of making all the light, that is admitted, fall upon the objects, which are chiefly meant to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The road to Amble&s;ide runs through the valley in front of Rydal|hall, and for &s;ome di&s;tance among the grounds that belong to it, where again the ta&s;te of the owner is con&s;picuous in the di&s;po&s;ition of plantations among pa&s;tures of extraordinary richne&s;s, and where
<PB N="472" REF="480">
pure rivulets are &s;uffered to wind without re&s;traint over their dark rocky channels. Woods mantle up the cliffs on either &s;ide of this &s;weet valley, and, higher &s;till, the craggy &s;ummits of the fells crowd over the &s;cene. Two miles among its plea&s;ant &s;hades, near the banks of the murmuring Rotha, brought us to Amble&s;ide, a black and very antient little town, hanging on the lower &s;teeps of a moun|tain, where the vale opens to the head of</P>

<HEAD>WINDERMERE,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH appeared at &s;ome di&s;tance below, in gentle yet &s;tately beauty; but its boundaries &s;hewed nothing of the &s;ublimity and little of the romantic wildne&s;s, that charms, or elevates in the &s;cenery of the other lakes. The &s;hores, and the hills, which gra|dually a&s;cend from them, are in general richly cultivated, or wooded, and correctly elegant; and when we de&s;cended upon the bank the road &s;eemed leading through the artificial &s;hades of plea&s;ure-grounds. It undulates for two miles over low promontories and along &s;pacious bays, full to their fringed margin with the abundance of this expan|&s;ive lake; then, quitting the bank, it a&s;cends gradual eminences, that look upon the va&s;t plain of water, and ri&s;e amid&s;t the riche&s;t land|&s;capes of its &s;hores. The manners of the people would have &s;uffi|ciently informed us that Windermere is the lake mo&s;t frequented;
<PB N="473" REF="481">
and with the great &s;ublimity of the more &s;eque&s;tered &s;cenes, we had to regret the intere&s;ting &s;implicity of their inhabitants, a &s;implicity which accorded &s;o beautifully with the dignified character of the country. The next day, we vi&s;ited &s;everal of the neighbouring heights, whence the lake is &s;een to great advantage; and, on the following, &s;kirted the ea&s;tern &s;hore for &s;ix miles to the Ferry.</P>
<P>Windermere, above twelve miles long and generally above a mile broad, but &s;ometimes two, &s;weeps like a maje&s;tic river with an ea&s;y bend between low points of land and eminences that, &s;haded with wood and often embelli&s;hed with villas, &s;well into hills cultivated to their &s;ummits; except that, for about &s;ix miles along the middle of the we&s;tern &s;hore, a range of rocky fells ri&s;e over the water. But the&s;e have nothing either picture&s;que or fanta&s;tic in their &s;hape; they are heavy, not broken into parts, and their rudene&s;s &s;oftens into in&s;ig|nificance, when they are &s;een over the wide channel of the lake; they are neither large enough to be grand, or wooded enough to be beautiful. To the north, or head of Windermere, however, the tamene&s;s of its general character di&s;appears, and the &s;cene &s;oars into grandeur. Here, over a ridge of rough brown hills above a woody &s;hore, ri&s;e, at the di&s;tance of a mile and half, or two miles, a mul|titude of finely alpine mountains, retiring obliquely in the per&s;pec|tive, among which Langdale-pikes, Hardknot and Wry-no&s;e, bearing their bold, pointed promontories aloft, are pre-eminent. The co|louring of the&s;e mountains, which are &s;ome of the grande&s;t of Cum|berland

<PB N="474" REF="482">
and We&s;tmoreland, was this day remarkably fine. The weather was &s;howery, with gleams of &s;un&s;hine; &s;ometimes their tops were entirely concealed in gray vapours, which, drawing up|wards, would &s;eem to a&s;cend in volumes of &s;moke from their &s;um|mits; at others, a few &s;cattered clouds wandered along their &s;ides, leaving their heads unveiled and effulgent with light. The&s;e clouds di&s;appearing before the &s;trength of the &s;un, a fine downy hue of light blue over&s;pread the peeping points of the mo&s;t di&s;tant fells, while the nearer ones were tinged with deep purple, which was oppo&s;ed to the brown heath and crag of the lower hills, the olive green of two wooded &s;lopes that, ju&s;t tinted by autumn, &s;eemed to de&s;cend to the margin, and the &s;ilver tran&s;parency of the expanding water at their feet. This view of Windermere appears with great ma|je&s;ty from a height above Culgarth, a &s;eat of the Bi&s;hop of Landaff; while, to the &s;outh, the lake after &s;weeping about four miles gradu|ally narrows and di&s;appears behind the great i&s;land, which &s;tretches acro&s;s the per&s;pective.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of two or three miles beyond Culgarth, from a hill advancing towards the water, the whole of Windermere is &s;een; to the right, is the white man&s;ion at Culgarth, among wood, on a gentle eminence of the &s;hore, with the lake &s;preading wide beyond, crowned by the fells half ob&s;cured in clouds. To the &s;outh, the hills of the ea&s;tern &s;hore, &s;loping gradually, run out in elegant and often well wooded points into the water, and are &s;potted with villas and varied above with enclo&s;ures. The oppo&s;ite &s;hore is for about
<PB N="475" REF="483">
a mile &s;outhward a continuation of the line of rock before noticed, from which Rawlin&s;on's-nab pu&s;hes a bold headland over the lake; the per&s;pective then &s;inks away in low hills, and is cro&s;&s;ed by a re|mote ridge, that clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The villages of Rayrig and Bowne&s;s, which are pa&s;&s;ed in the way to the Ferry, both &s;tand delightfully; one on an eminence com|manding the whole lake, and the other within a rece&s;s of the &s;hore, nearly oppo&s;ite the large i&s;land. The winding banks of Winder|mere continually open new land&s;capes as you move along them, and the mountains, which crown its head, are as frequently changing their attitudes; but Langdale-pikes, the bolde&s;t features in the &s;cene, are &s;oon lo&s;t to the eye behind the nearer fells of the we&s;tern &s;hore.</P>
<P>The ferry is con&s;iderably below Chri&s;tian's i&s;land, and at the narrowe&s;t &s;pan of the lake, where two points of the &s;hore extend to meet each other. This i&s;land, &s;aid to contain thirty acres, inter|mingled with wood, lawn and &s;hrubberies, embelli&s;hes, without de|crea&s;ing the dignity of the &s;cene; it is &s;urrounded by attendant i&s;lets, &s;ome rocky, but others, beautifully covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;eem to coronet the flood.</P>
<P>In cro&s;&s;ing the water the illu&s;ions of vi&s;ion give force to the northern mountains, which viewed from hence appear to a&s;cend from its margin and to &s;pread round it in a magnificent amphithea|tre. This was to us the mo&s;t intere&s;ting view on Windermere.</P>
<P>On our approaching the we&s;tern &s;hore, the range of rocks that form it, di&s;covered their cliffs, and gradually a&s;&s;umed a con&s;equence,
<PB N="476" REF="484">
which the breadth of the channel had denied them; and their dark|ne&s;s was well oppo&s;ed by the bright verdure and variegated autumnal tints of the i&s;les at their ba&s;e. On the bank, under &s;helter of the&s;e rocks, a white hou&s;e was &s;een beyond the tall boles of a mo&s;t lux|uriant grove of plane-trees, which threw their &s;hadows over it, and on the margin of the &s;ilver lake &s;preading in front. From hence the road a&s;cends the &s;teep and craggy &s;ide of Furne&s;s-fell, on the brow of which we had a la&s;t view of Windermere, in its whole cour&s;e; to the &s;outh, its tame but elegant land&s;capes gliding away into low and long per&s;pective, and the lake gradually narrowing; to the north, its more impre&s;&s;ive &s;cenery; but the fine&s;t features of it were now concealed by a continuation of the rocks we were upon.</P>
<P>Windermere is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the other lakes of this coun|try by its &s;uperior length and breath, by the gentle hills, cultivated and enclo&s;ed nearly to their &s;ummits, that generally bind its &s;hores, by the gradual di&s;tance and fine di&s;po&s;ition of the northern moun|tains, by the bold &s;weeps of its numerous bays, by the villas that &s;peckle and rich plantations that wind them, and by one large i&s;land, &s;urrounded by many i&s;lets, which adds dignity to its bo&s;om. On the other lakes the i&s;lands are prettine&s;&s;es, that do not accord with the character of the &s;cene; they break al&s;o the &s;urface of the water where va&s;t continuity is required; and the mind cannot endure to de&s;cend &s;uddenly from the gigantic &s;ublimity of nature to her fairy &s;ports. Yet, on the whole, Windermere was to us the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ive of all the lakes. Except to the north, where the retiring mountains
<PB N="477" REF="485">
are di&s;po&s;ed with uncommon grandeur of outline and magnificence of colouring, its &s;cenery is tame, having little of the wild and nothing of the a&s;toni&s;hing energy that appears on the features of the more &s;eque&s;tered di&s;tricts. The characters of the three great lakes may, perhaps, be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed:</P>
<P>Windermere: Diffu&s;ivene&s;s, &s;tately beauty, and, at the upper end, magnificence.</P>
<P>Ull&s;water: Severe grandeur and &s;ublimity; all that may give ideas of va&s;t power and a&s;toni&s;hing maje&s;ty. The effect of Ull&s;water is, that, awful as its &s;cenery appears, it awakens the mind to expecta|tion &s;till more awful, and, touching all the powers of imagination, in&s;pires that <Q REND="inline">"fine phren&s;y"</Q> de&s;criptive of the poet's eye, which not only bodies forth unreal forms, but imparts to &s;ub&s;tantial objects a character higher than their own.</P>
<P>Derwentwater: Fanta&s;tic wildne&s;s and romantic beauty, but infe|rior to Ull&s;water in greatne&s;s, both of water and rocks; for, though it charms and elevates, it does not di&s;play &s;uch features and circum|&s;tances of the &s;ublime, or call up &s;uch expectation of unimaged and uncertain wonder. A principal defect, if we may venture to call it &s;o, of Derwentwater is, that the water is too &s;mall in proportion for the amphitheatre of the valley in which it lies, and therefore lo&s;es much of the dignity, that in other circum&s;tances it would exhibit. The fault of Windermere is, perhaps, exactly the rever&s;e; where the &s;hores, not generally grand, are rendered tamer by the ample expan&s;e of the lake. The proportions of Ull&s;water are more ju&s;t, and,
<PB N="478" REF="486">
though its winding form gives it in &s;ome parts the air of a river, the abrupt and tremendous height of its rocks, the dark and crowding &s;ummits of the fells above, the manner in which they enclo&s;e it, together with the dignity of its breadth, empower it con&s;tantly to affect the mind with emotions of a&s;toni&s;hment and lofty expectation.</P>

<P>AFTER a&s;cending the laborious crags and precipices of Furne&s;s-fell, enlivened, however, by frequent views of the &s;outhern end of Windermere, the road immediately de&s;cends the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the mountain, which &s;huts out the beautiful &s;cenery of the lake; but the pro&s;pect &s;oon after opens to other mountains of Furne&s;s, in the di&s;tance, which revive the expectation of &s;uch &s;ublimity as we had lately regretted, and to E&s;thwait-water in the valley below.

<P>Hawk&s;head, thus delightfully placed, is an antient, but &s;mall town, with a few good hou&s;es, and a neat town-hou&s;e, lately built by &s;ub|&s;criptions, of which the chief part was gratefully &s;upplied by London merchants, who had been educated at the free &s;chool here; and this &s;chool it&s;elf is a memorial of gratitude, having been founded by Archbi&s;hop Sandys for the advantage of the town, which gave him birth. Near Hawk&s;head are the remains of the hou&s;e, where the Abbot of Furne&s;s <Q REND="inline">"kept re&s;idence by one or more monks, who per|formed divine &s;ervice and other parochial duties in the neighbour|hood."</Q> There is &s;till a court-room over the gateway, <Q REND="inline">"where the bailiff of Hawk&s;head held court, and di&s;tributed ju&s;tice, in the name of the aboot."</Q></P>
<P>From the tremendous &s;teeps of the long fell, which towers over Hawk&s;head, a&s;toni&s;hing views open to the di&s;tant vales and moun|tains of Cumberland; overlooking all the grote&s;que &s;ummits in the neighbourhood of Gra&s;mere, the fells of Borrowdale in the furthe&s;t di&s;tance, Langdale-pikes, and &s;everal &s;mall lakes, &s;een gleaming in the bo&s;om of the mountains. Before us, ro&s;e the whole multitude of Coni&s;ton-fells, of immen&s;e height and threatening forms, their tops thinly darkened with thunder mi&s;ts, and, on the left, Furne&s;s-<PB N="480" REF="488">fells
&s;inking towards the bay, which Ulver&s;ton &s;ands form for the &s;ea.</P>
<P>As we advanced, Coni&s;ton-fells &s;eemed to multiply, and became &s;till more impre&s;&s;ive, till, having reached at length the &s;ummit of the mountain, we looked down upon Thur&s;ton-lake immediately below, and &s;aw them ri&s;ing abruptly round its northern end in &s;ome|what of the &s;ublime attitudes and dark maje&s;ty of Ull&s;water. A range of lower rocks, nearer to the eye, exhibited a very peculiar and gro|te&s;que appearance, coloured &s;cars and deep channels marking their purple &s;ides, as if they had been rifted by an earthquake.</P>
<P>The road de&s;cends the flinty &s;teeps towards the ea&s;tern bank of the lake, that &s;preads a &s;urface of &s;ix miles in length and generally three quarters of a mile in breadth, not winding in its cour&s;e, yet much indented with bays, and pre&s;enting nearly its whole extent at once to the eye. The grande&s;t features are the fells, that crown its north|ern end, not di&s;tantly and gradually, like tho&s;e of Windermere, nor varied like them with magnificent colouring, but ri&s;ing in haughty abruptne&s;s, dark, rugged and &s;tupendous, within a quarter of a mile of the margin, and &s;hutting out all pro&s;pect of other mountain-&s;um|mits. At their feet, pa&s;tures &s;pread a bright green to the brim of the lake. Nearly in the centre of the&s;e fells, which open in a &s;emicircle to receive the lake, a cataract de&s;cends, but its &s;hining line is not of a breadth proportioned to the va&s;tne&s;s of its perpendicular fall. The village of Coni&s;ton is &s;weetly &s;eated under &s;helter of the rocks; and, at a di&s;tance beyond, on the edge of the water, the antient hall,
<PB N="481" REF="489">
or priory, &s;hews its turret and ivyed ruins among old woods. The whole picture is reflected in the liquid mirror below. The gay, convivial chorus, or &s;olemn ve&s;per, that once &s;welled along the lake from the&s;e con&s;ecrated walls, and awakened, perhaps, the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of the voyager, while evening &s;tole upon the &s;cene, is now con|tra&s;ted by de&s;olation and profound repo&s;e, and, as he glides by, he hears only the da&s;hing of his oars, or the &s;urge beating on the &s;hore.</P>
<P>This lake appeared to us one of the mo&s;t charming we had &s;een. From the &s;ublime mountains, which bend round its head, the heights, on either &s;ide, decline towards the &s;outh into waving hills, that form its &s;hores, and often &s;tretch in long &s;weeping points into the water, generally covered with tufted wood, but &s;ometimes with the tender verdure of pa&s;turage. The tops of the&s;e woods were ju&s;t embrowned with autumn, and contra&s;ted well with other &s;lopes, rough and heathy, that ro&s;e above, or fell be&s;ide them to the water's brink, and added force to the colouring, which the reddi&s;h tints of decaying fern, the purple bloom of heath, and the bright golden gleams of broom, &s;pread over the&s;e elegant banks. Their hues, the graceful undulations of the marginal hills and bays, the richne&s;s of the woods, the &s;olemnity of the northern fells and the deep repo&s;e, that pervades the &s;cene, where only now and then a white cottage or a farm lurks among the trees, are circum&s;tances, which render Thur&s;ton-lake one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and, perhaps, the mo&s;t beautiful of any in the country.</P>
<P>The road undulates over cop&s;y hills, and dips into &s;hallow vallies
<PB N="482" REF="490">
along the whole of the ea&s;tern bank, &s;eldom greatly elevated above the water, or de&s;cending to a level with it, but frequently opening to exten&s;ive views of its beauties, and again &s;hrouding it&s;elf in verdant gloom. The mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive pictures were formed by the fells, that crowd over the upper end of the lake, and which, viewed from a low &s;tation, &s;ometimes appeared nearly to enclo&s;e that part of it. The effect was then a&s;toni&s;hingly grand, particularly about &s;un-&s;et, when the clouds, drawing upwards, di&s;covered the utmo&s;t &s;ummits of the&s;e fells, and a tint of du&s;ky blue began to prevail over them, which gradually deepened into night. A line of lower rocks, that extend from the&s;e, are, independently of the atmo&s;phere, of a dull purple, and their &s;haggy forms would appear gigantic in almo&s;t any other &s;ituation. Even here, they pre&s;erve a wild dignity, and their atti|tudes &s;omewhat re&s;emble tho&s;e at the entrance of Borrowdale; but they are forgotten, when the eye is lifted to the &s;olemn mountains immediately above. The&s;e are rich in &s;late quarries, and have &s;ome copper mines; but the latter were clo&s;ed, during the civil wars of the la&s;t century, having been worked, as we are told in the de&s;criptive language of the miners, from <HI>the day to the evening end,</HI> forty fathom, and to the <HI>morning end</HI> &s;even &s;core fathom; a &s;igurative &s;tyle of di&s;tingui&s;hing the we&s;tern and ea&s;tern directions of the mine. The lake, towards the lower end, narrows and is adorned by one &s;mall i&s;land; but here the hills of the ea&s;tern &s;hore &s;oar into fells, &s;ome barren, craggy and nearly perpendicular, others en|tirely covered with coppice-wood. Two of the&s;e, ri&s;ing over the
<PB N="483" REF="491">
road, gave fine relief to each other, the one &s;hewing only precipices of &s;helving rock, while its rival a&s;pired with woods, that mantled from the ba&s;e to the &s;ummit, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of oak, a&s;h and holly. Not any lake, that we &s;aw, is at pre&s;ent &s;o much embelli&s;hed with wood as Thur&s;ton. All the mountains of <HI>High</HI> and the vallies of <HI>Low Furne&s;s</HI> were, indeed, &s;ome centuries ago, covered with fore&s;ts, part of which was called the Fore&s;t of Lanca&s;ter; and the&s;e were of &s;uch entangled luxuriance as to be nearly impenetrable in many tracts. Here, wolves, wild boars, and a remarkably large breed of deer, called Leghs, the heads of which have frequently been found buried at a con&s;iderable depth in the &s;oil, abounded. So &s;ecure an a&s;ylum did the&s;e animals find in the woods of High Furne&s;s, that, even after the low lands were cleared and cultivated, &s;hepherds were nece&s;&s;ary to guard the flocks from the ravages of the wolves. Towards the end of the thirteenth century, the upper fore&s;ts al&s;o were nearly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>In winter, the &s;hepherds u&s;ed to feed their flocks with the young &s;prouts of a&s;h and holly, a cu&s;tom &s;aid to be &s;till ob&s;erved; the &s;heep coming at the call of the &s;hepherd and a&s;&s;embling round the holly|tree to receive from his hand the young &s;hoots cropped for them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We&s;t's "Antiquities of Furne&s;s."</NOTE>. Whenever the woods are felled, which is too frequently done, to &s;up|ply fuel for the neighbouring furnaces, the holly is &s;till held &s;acred to the flocks of the&s;e mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="492">
Soon after pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;land, the road enters the village of Nib|thwaite, rich only in &s;ituation; for the cottages are mi&s;erable. The people &s;eemed to be as ignorant as poor; a young man knew not how far it was to Ulver&s;ton, or as he called it Ul&s;on, though it was only five miles.</P>
<P>On the point of a promontory of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, em|bo&s;omed in ancient woods, the chimnies and pointed roof of a gray man&s;ion look out mo&s;t intere&s;tingly. The woods open par|tially to the north, and admit a view of the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> &s;cenery at the head of the lake, in its fine&s;t po&s;ition. On the other &s;ides, the oaks &s;o embower the hou&s;e and &s;pread down the rocks, as &s;carcely to allow it a glimp&s;e of the water bickering between the dark foliage below.</P>
<P>At Nibthwaite, the lake becomes narrow and gradually decrea&s;es, till it terminates at Lowick-bridge, where it glides away in the little river Crake, which de&s;cends to Ulver&s;ton &s;ands. We &s;topped upon the bridge to take a la&s;t view of the &s;cene; the di&s;tant fells were di&s;appearing in twilight, but the gray lake gleamed at their ba&s;e. From the &s;teeps of a lofty mountain, that ro&s;e near us on the right, cattle were &s;lowly de&s;cending for the night, winding among the crags, &s;ometimes &s;topping to crop the heath, or broom, and then di&s;|appearing for a moment behind the darker verdure of yews, that grew in knots upon the cliffs.</P>
<P>It was night before we reached Ulver&s;ton. The wind &s;ounded
<PB N="485" REF="493">
mournfully among the hills and we perceived our approach to the &s;ea only by the faint roaring of the tide, till from a brow, whence the hills open on either hand with a grand &s;weep, we could ju&s;t di&s;|cern the gray &s;urface of the &s;ea-bay, at a di&s;tance below, and then, by lights that glimmered in the bottom, the town of Ulver&s;ton, lying not far from the &s;hore and &s;creened on the north by the heights, from which we were to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Ulver&s;ton is a neat but ancient town, the capital and chief port of Furne&s;s. The road from it to the maje&s;tic ruin of Furne&s;s Abbey lies through Low Furne&s;s, and lo&s;es the general wildne&s;s and intere&s;t of the country, except where now and then the di&s;tant retro&s;pect of the mountains breaks over the tame hills and regular enclo&s;ures, that border it.</P>
<P>About a mile and a half on this &s;ide of the Abbey, the road pa&s;&s;es through Dalton, a very antient little town, once the capital of Low Furne&s;s, and rendered &s;o important by its neighbourhood to the Abbey, that Ulver&s;ton, the pre&s;ent capital, could not then &s;upport the weekly market, for which it had obtained a charter. Dalton, however, &s;unk with the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of its neighbouring patrons, and is now chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the plea&s;antne&s;s of its &s;ituation, to which a church, built on a bold a&s;cent, and the remains of a ca&s;tle, advantageou&s;ly placed for the command of the adjoining valley, &s;till attach &s;ome degree of dignity. What now exi&s;ts of the latter is one tower, in a chamber of whichthe Abbot of Furne&s;s held his &s;ecular
<PB N="486" REF="494">
Court; and the chamber was afterwards u&s;ed as a gaol for debtors, till within the&s;e few years, when the dead ruin relea&s;ed the living one. The pre&s;ent church-yard and the &s;cite of this ca&s;tle are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been included within the limits of a <HI>ca&s;tellum,</HI> built by Agricola, of the fo&s;&s;e of which there are &s;till &s;ome faint ve&s;tiges.</P>
<P>Beneath the brow, on which the church and tower &s;tand, a brook flows through a narrow valley, that winds about a mile and a half to the Abbey. In the way thither we pa&s;&s;ed the entrance of one of the very rich iron mines, with which the neighbourhood abounds; and the deep red tint of the &s;oil, that over&s;preads almo&s;t the whole country between Ulver&s;ton and the mona&s;tery, &s;ufficiently indicates the nature of the trea&s;ures beneath.</P>
<P>In a clo&s;e glen, branching from this valley, &s;hrouded by winding banks clumped with old groves of oak and che&s;nut, we found the magnificent remains of</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="487" REF="495">
<HEAD>FURNESS ABBEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE deep retirement of its &s;ituation, the venerable gran|deur of its gothic arches and the luxuriant yet ancient trees, that &s;hadow this for&s;aken &s;pot, are circum&s;tances of picture&s;que and, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be allowed, of &s;entimental beauty, which fill the mind with &s;olemn yet delightful emotion. This glen is called the Vale of Night&s;hade, or, more literally from its ancient title Bekangs|gill, the <Q REND="inline">"glen of deadly night&s;hade,"</Q> that plant being abundantly found in the neighbourhood. Its romantic gloom and &s;eque&s;tered privacy particularly adapted it to the au&s;terities of mona&s;tic life; and in the mo&s;t retired part of it King Stephen, while Earl of Mortaign and Bulloign, founded, in the year 1127, the magnificent mona&s;tery of Furne&s;s, and endowed it with princely wealth and almo&s;t princely authority, in which it was &s;econd only to Fontain's-abbey in York|&s;hire.</P>
<P>The windings of the glen conceal the&s;e venerable ruins, till they are clo&s;ely approached, and the bye road, that conducted us, is mar|gined with a few ancient oaks, which &s;tretch their broad branches entirely acro&s;s it, and are &s;inely preparatory objects to the &s;cene beyond. A &s;udden bend in this road brought us within view of the northern gate of the Abbey, a beautiful gothic arch, one &s;ide of which is luxuriantly fe&s;tooned with night&s;hade. A thick grove of
<PB N="488" REF="496">
plane-trees, with &s;ome oak and beech, over&s;hadow it on the right, and lead the eye onward to the ruins of the Abbey, &s;een through this dark arch in remote per&s;pective, over rough but verdant ground. The principal features are the great northern window and part of the ea&s;tern choir, with glimp&s;es of &s;hattered arches and &s;tately walls be|yond, caught between the gaping ca&s;ements. On the left, the bank of the glen is broken into knolls capped with oaks, which in &s;ome places &s;pread downwards to a &s;tream that winds round the ruin, and darken it with their rich foliage. Through this gate is the entrance to the immediate precincts of the Abbey, an area &s;aid to contain &s;ixty-five acres, now called the Deer-park. It is enclo&s;ed by a &s;tone wall, on which the remains of many &s;mall buildings and the faint ve&s;tiges of others, &s;till appear; &s;uch as the porter's lodge, mills, granaries, ovens and kilns that once &s;upplied the mona&s;tery, &s;ome of which, &s;een under the &s;hade of the fine old trees, that on every &s;ide adorn the broken &s;teeps of this glen, have a very intere&s;ting effect.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t within the gate, a &s;mall manor hou&s;e of modern date, with its &s;tables and other offices, breaks di&s;cordantly upon the lonely gran|deur of the &s;cene. Except this, the character of the de&s;erted ruin is &s;crupulou&s;ly pre&s;erved in the &s;urrounding area; no &s;pade has dared to level the inequalities, which fallen fragments have occa&s;ioned in the ground, or &s;hears to clip the wild fern and underwood, that over&s;pread it; but every circum&s;tance con&s;pires to heighten the &s;oli|tary grace of the principal object and to prolong the luxurious me|lancholy, which the view of it in&s;pires. We made our way among
<PB N="489" REF="497">
the pathle&s;s fern and gra&s;s to the north end of the church, now, like every other part of the Abbey, entirely roofle&s;s, but &s;hewing the lofty arch of the great window, where, in&s;tead of the painted gla&s;s that once enriched it, are now tufted plants and wreaths of night&s;hade. Below is the principal door of the church, bending into a deep round arch, which, retiring circle within circle, is rich and beautiful; the remains of a winding &s;tair-ca&s;e are vi&s;ible within the wall on its left &s;ide. Near this northern end of the edifice are &s;een one &s;ide of the ea&s;tern choir, with its two &s;lender gothic window frames, and on the we&s;t a remnant of the nave of the Abbey and &s;ome lofty arches, which once belonged to the belfry, now detached from the main building.</P>
<P>To the &s;outh, but concealed from this point of view, are the chapter-hou&s;e, &s;ome years ago exhibiting a roof of beautiful gothic &s;retwork, and which was almo&s;t the only part of the Abbey thus or|namented, its architecture having been characteri&s;ed by an air of grand &s;implicity rather than by the elegance and richne&s;s of decoration, which in an after date di&s;tingui&s;hed the gothic &s;tyle in England. Over the chapter-hou&s;e were once the library and &s;criptorium, and beyond it are &s;till the remains of cloi&s;ters, of the refectory, the locutorium, or conver&s;ation-room, and the calefactory. The&s;e, with the walls of &s;ome chapels, of the ve&s;try, a hall, and of what is believed to have been a &s;chool-hou&s;e, are all the features of this noble edifice that can ea&s;ily be traced: winding &s;tair-ca&s;es within the &s;urpri&s;ing thickne&s;s of the walls, and door-ca&s;es involved in darkne&s;s and my&s;tery, the place abounds with.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="498">
The abbey, which was formerly of &s;uch magnitude as nearly to fill up the breadth of the glen, is built of a pale-red &s;tone, dug from the neighbouring rocks, now changed by time and weather to a tint of du&s;ky brown, which accords well with the hues of plants and &s;hrubs that every where embo&s;s the mouldering arches.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t view of the ruin is on the ea&s;t &s;ide, where, beyond the va&s;t, &s;hattered frame that once contained a richly-painted window, is &s;een a per&s;pective of the choir and of di&s;tant arches, remains of the nave of the abbey, clo&s;ed by the woods. This per&s;pective of the ruin is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Antiquities of Furne&s;s."</NOTE> &s;aid to be two hundred and eighty-&s;even feet in length; the choir part of it is in width only twenty-eight feet in&s;ide, but the nave is &s;eventy: the walls, as they now &s;tand, are fifty-four feet high and in thickne&s;s five. Southward from the choir extend the &s;till beauti|ful, though broken, pillars and arcades of &s;ome chapels, now laid open to the day; the chapter-hou&s;e, the cloi&s;ters, and beyond all, and detached from all, is the &s;chool-hou&s;e, a large building, the only part of the mona&s;tery that &s;till boa&s;ts a roof.</P>
<P>As, &s;oothed by the venerable &s;hades and the view of a more vene|rable ruin, we re&s;ted oppo&s;ite to the ea&s;tern window of the choir, where once the high altar &s;tood, and, with five other altars, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the religious pomp of the &s;cene; the images and the manners of times, that were pa&s;t, ro&s;e to reflection. The midnight proce&s;&s;ion of monks, clothed in white and bearing lighted tapers, appeared to the <Q REND="inline">"mind's eye"</Q> i&s;&s;uing to the choir through the very door-ca&s;e, by
<PB N="491" REF="499">
which &s;uch proce&s;&s;ions were wont to pa&s;s from the cloi&s;ters to per|form the matin &s;ervice, when, at the moment of their entering the church, the deep chanting of voices was heard, and the organ &s;welled a &s;olemn peal. To fancy, the &s;train &s;till echoed feebly along the arcades and died in the breeze among the woods, the ru&s;tling leaves mingling with the clo&s;e. It was ea&s;y to image the abbot and the officiating prie&s;ts &s;eated beneath the richly-fretted canopy of the four &s;talls, that &s;till remain entire in the &s;outhern wall, and high over which is now perched a &s;olitary yew-tree, a black funereal memento to the living of tho&s;e who once &s;at below.</P>
<P>Of a quadrangular court on the we&s;t &s;ide of the church, three hun|dred and thirty-four feet long and one hundred and two feet wide, little ve&s;tige now appears, except the foundation of a range of cloi&s;|ters, that formed its we&s;tern boundary, and under the &s;hade of which the monks on days of high &s;olemnity pa&s;&s;ed in their cu&s;tomary pro|ce&s;&s;ion round the court. What was the belfry is now a huge ma&s;s of detached ruin, picture&s;que from the loftine&s;s of its &s;hattered arches and the high inequalities of the ground within them, where the tower, that once crowned this building, having fallen, lies in va&s;t fragments, now covered with earth and gra&s;s, and no longer di&s;tin|gui&s;hable but by the hillock they form.</P>
<P>The &s;chool-hou&s;e, a heavy &s;tructure attached to the boundary wall on the &s;outh, is nearly entire, and the walls, particularly of the por|tal, are of enormous thickne&s;s, but, here and there, a cha&s;m di&s;clo&s;es the &s;tair-ca&s;es, that wind within them to chambers above. The &s;chool|room
<PB N="492" REF="500">
below, &s;hews only a &s;tone bench, that extends round the walls, and a low &s;tone pillar in the ea&s;tern corner, on which the teacher's pulpit was formerly fixed. The lofty vaulted roof is &s;carcely di&s;tin|gui&s;hable by the du&s;ky light admitted through one or two narrow windows placed high from the ground, perhaps for the purpo&s;e of con&s;ining the &s;cholar's attention to his book.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal features, that remain of this once magnifi|cent abbey. It was dedicated to St. Mary, and received a colony of monks from the mona&s;tery of Savigny in Normandy, who were called Gray Monks, from their dre&s;s of that colour, till they became Ci&s;tercians, and, with the &s;evere rules of St. Bernard, adopted a white habit, which they retained till the di&s;&s;olution of mona&s;tic orders in England. The original rules of St. Bernard partook in &s;everal in&s;tances of the au&s;terities of tho&s;e of La Trapp, and the &s;ociety did not very readily relinqui&s;h the milder laws of St. Benedict for the new rigours impo&s;ed upon them by the parent mona&s;tery of Savigny. They were forbidden to ta&s;te fle&s;h, except when ill, and even eggs, butter, chee&s;e and milk, but on extraordinary occa&s;ions; and denied even the u&s;e of linen and fur. The monks were divided into two cla&s;&s;es, to which &s;eparate departments belonged. Tho&s;e, who attended the choir, &s;lept upon &s;traw in their u&s;ual habits, from which, at midnight, they ro&s;e and pa&s;&s;ed into the church, where they continued their holy hymns, during the &s;hort remainder of the night. After this fir&s;t ma&s;s, having publicly confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, they retired to their cells, and the day was employed in &s;piritual
<PB N="493" REF="501">
exerci&s;es and in copying or illuminating manu&s;cripts. An un|broken &s;ilence was ob&s;erved, except when, after dinner, they with|drew into the locutorium, where for an hour, perhaps, they were permitted the common privilege of &s;ocial beings. This cla&s;s was con&s;ined to the boundary wall, except that, on &s;ome particular days, the members of it were allowed to walk in parties beyond it, for exerci&s;e and amu&s;ement; but they were very &s;eldom permit|ted either to receive, or pay vi&s;its. Like the monks of La Trapp, however, they were di&s;tingui&s;hed for exten&s;ive charities and liberal ho&s;pitality; for travellers were &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly entertained at the abbey, that it was not till the di&s;&s;olution that an inn was thought nece&s;&s;ary in this part of Furne&s;s, when one was opened for their accommodation, expre&s;sly becau&s;e the mona&s;tery could no longer receive them.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd cla&s;s were a&s;&s;igned the cultivation of the lands and the performance of dome&s;tic affairs in the mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>This was the &s;econd hou&s;e in England, that received the Bernardine rules, the mo&s;t rigorous of which were, however, di&s;pen&s;ed with in 1485 by Sixtus the Fourth, when, among other indulgences, the whole order was allowed to ta&s;te meat on three days of the week. With the rules of St. Benedict, the monks had exchanged their gray habit for a white ca&s;&s;ock with a white caul and &s;capulary. But their choir dre&s;s was either white or gray, with caul and &s;capulary of the &s;ame, and a girdle of black wool; over that a mozet, or hood,

<P>The privileges and immunities, granted to the Ci&s;tercian order in general, were very abundant; and tho&s;e to the Abbey of Furne&s;s were proportioned to its va&s;t endowments. The abbot, it has been mentioned, held his &s;ecular court in the neighbouring ca&s;tle of Dal|ton, where he pre&s;ided with the power of admini&s;tering not only ju&s;tice but inju&s;tice, &s;ince the lives and property of the villain tenants of the lord&s;hip of Furne&s;s were con&s;igned by a grant of King Ste|phen to the di&s;po&s;al of my lord abbot! The monks al&s;o could be arraigned, for whatever crime, only by him. <Q REND="inline">"The military e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of Furne&s;s likewi&s;e depended on the abbot. Every me&s;ne lord and free homager, as well as the cu&s;tomary tenants, took an oath of fealty to the abbot, to be true to him again&s;t all men, excepting the king. Every me&s;ne lord obeyed the &s;ummons of the abbot, or his &s;teward, in rai&s;ing his quota of armed men, and every tenant of a whole tenement furni&s;hed a man and hor&s;e of war for guarding the coa&s;t, for the border-&s;ervice, or any expedition again&s;t the common enemy of the king and kingdom. The habiliments of war were a &s;teel coat, or coat of mail, a falce, or falchion, a jack, the bow, the bill, the cro&s;s-bow and &s;pear. The Furne&s;s legion con&s;i&s;ted of four divi&s;ions:&mdash;one of bowmen hor&s;ed and harne&s;&s;ed; bylmen hor&s;ed and harne&s;&s;ed; bowmen without hor&s;e and harne&s;s; bylmen with|out hor&s;e and harne&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

The deep fore&s;ts, that once &s;urrounded the Abbey, and over&s;pread all Furne&s;s, contributed with its in&s;ulated &s;ituation, on a neck of land running out into the &s;ea, to &s;ecure it from the depredations of the Scots, who were continually committing ho&s;tilities on the borders. On a &s;ummit over the Abbey are the remains of a beacon, or watch|tower, rai&s;ed by the &s;ociety for their further &s;ecurity. It commands exten&s;ive views over Low Furne&s;s and the bay of the &s;ea imme|diately beneath; looking forward to the town and ca&s;tle of Lanca|&s;ter, appearing faintly on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t; on the &s;outh, to the i&s;les of Wanley, Foulney, and their numerous i&s;lets, on one of which &s;tands Peel-ca&s;tle; and, on the north, to the mountains of High Furne&s;s and Coni&s;ton, ri&s;ing in grand amphitheatre round this inlet of the Iri&s;h Channel. De&s;cription can &s;carcely &s;ugge&s;t the full mag|nificence of &s;uch a pro&s;pect, to which the monks, emerging from their concealed cells below, occa&s;ionally re&s;orted to &s;ooth the a&s;pe|rities, which the &s;evere di&s;cipline of &s;uper&s;tition inflicted on the temper; or, freed from the ob&s;ervance of jealous eyes, to indulge, perhaps, the &s;igh of regret, which a con&s;ideration of the world they had renounced, thus gloriou&s;ly given back to their &s;ight, would &s;ome|times awaken.</P>
<P>From Hawcoat, a few miles to the we&s;t of Furne&s;s, the view is &s;till more exten&s;ive, whence, in a clear day, the whole length of the I&s;le of Man may be &s;een, with part of Angle&s;ey and the mountains of Caernarvon, Merioneth&s;hire, Denbigh&s;hire and Flint&s;hire, &s;hadow|ing the oppo&s;ite horizon of the channel.</P>

The &s;um total of all rents belonging to the Abbey immediately before the di&s;&s;olution was 946l. 2s. 10d. collected from Lanca&s;hire, Cum|berland, and even from the I&s;le of Man; a &s;um, which con&s;idering the value of money at that period; and the woods, meadows, pa&s;|tures, and &s;i&s;heries, retained by the &s;ociety in their own hands; the quantity of provi&s;ions for dome&s;tic u&s;e brought by the tenants in|&s;tead of rent, and the &s;hares of mines, mills, and &s;altworks, which belonged to the Abbey, &s;wells its former riches to an enormous amount.</P>
<P>Pyle, the la&s;t abbot, &s;urrendered with twenty-nine monks, to Henry the Eighth, April the 9th 1537, and in return was made Rector of Dalton, a &s;ituation then valued at thirty-three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence a year.</P>

<HEAD>FROM ULVERSTON TO LANCASTER.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the abbey we returned to Ulver&s;ton, and from thence cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ands to Lanca&s;ter, a ride &s;ingularly intere&s;ting and &s;ublime. From the Carter's hou&s;e, which &s;tands on the edge of the Ulver&s;ton &s;ands, and at the point, whence pa&s;&s;engers enter them, to Lanca&s;ter, within the furthe&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;hore, is fifteen miles. This noble bay is interrupted by the penin&s;ula of Cartmel, extending a line of white rocky coa&s;t, that divides the Leven and

<PB N="497" REF="505">
Ulver&s;ton &s;ands from tho&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. The former are four miles over; the latter &s;even.</P>
<P>We took the early part of the tide, and entered the&s;e va&s;t and de&s;o|late plains before the &s;ea had entirely left them, or the morning mi&s;ts were &s;ufficiently di&s;&s;ipated to allow a view of di&s;tant objects; but the grand &s;weep of the coa&s;t could be faintly traced, on the left, and a va&s;t wa&s;te of &s;and &s;tretching far below it, with mingled &s;treaks of gray water, that heightened its dreary a&s;pect. The tide was ebbing fa&s;t from our wheels, and its low murmur was interrupted, fir&s;t, only by the &s;hrill &s;mall cry of &s;ea-gulls, un&s;een, who&s;e hovering flight could be traced by the &s;ound, near an i&s;land that began to dawn through the mi&s;t; and then, by the hoar&s;er croaking of &s;ea-gee&s;e, which took a wider range, for their &s;hifting voices were heard from various quarters of the &s;urrounding coa&s;t. The body of the &s;ea, on the right, was &s;till involved, and the di&s;tant mountains on our left, that crown the bay, were al&s;o viewle&s;s; but it was &s;ublimely intere&s;ting to watch the heavy vapours beginning to move, then rolling in lengthening volumes over the &s;cene, and, as they gradually di&s;&s;ipated, di&s;covering through their veil the various objects they had concealed&mdash;fi&s;hermen with carts and nets &s;tealing along the margin of the tide, little boats putting off from the &s;hore, and, the view &s;till enlarging as the vapours expanded, the main &s;ea it&s;elf &s;oftening into the horizon, with here and there a dim &s;ail moving in the hazy di&s;tance. The wide de&s;ola|tion of the &s;ands, on the left, was animated only by &s;ome hor&s;emen
<PB N="498" REF="506">
riding remotely in groups towards Lanca&s;ter, along the winding edge of the water, and by a mu&s;cle-fi&s;her in his cart trying to ford the channel we were approaching.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t round the bay was now di&s;tinctly, though remotely, &s;een, ri&s;ing in woods, white cliffs and cultivated &s;lopes towards the moun|tains of Furne&s;s, on who&s;e dark brows the vapours hovered. The &s;hore falls into frequent rece&s;&s;es and juts out in promontories, where villages and country &s;eats are thickly &s;trewn. Among the latter, Holker-hall, deep among woods, &s;tands in the north. The village and hall of Bard&s;ea, once the &s;ite of a mona&s;tery, with a rocky back-ground and, in front, meadows falling towards the water; and Coni&s;head priory, with its &s;piry woods, the paragon of beauty, lie along the we&s;tern coa&s;t, where the hills, &s;welling gently from the i&s;le of Walney, nearly the la&s;t point of land vi&s;ible on that &s;ide the bay, and extending to the north, &s;weep upwards towards the fells of High Furne&s;s and the whole a&s;&s;emblage of We&s;tmoreland mountains, that crown the grand boundary of this arm of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>We &s;et out rather earlier than was nece&s;&s;ary, for the benefit of the guide over part of the&s;e trackle&s;s wa&s;tes, who was going to his &s;ta|tion on a &s;and near the fir&s;t ford, where he remains to conduct pa&s;|&s;engers acro&s;s the united &s;treams of the rivers Crake and Leven, till the returning tide wa&s;hes him off. He is punctual to the &s;pot as the tides them&s;elves, where he &s;hivers in the dark comfortle&s;s mid|nights of winter, and is &s;corched on the &s;hadele&s;s &s;ands, under the
<PB N="499" REF="507">
noons of &s;ummer, for a &s;tipend of ten pounds a year! and he &s;aid that he had fulfilled the office for thirty years. He has, how|ever, perqui&s;ites occa&s;ionally from the pa&s;&s;engers. In early times the Prior of Coni&s;head, who e&s;tabli&s;hed the guide, paid him with three acres of land and an annuity of fifteen marks; at the di&s;&s;olution, Henry the Eighth charged him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors with the pay|ment of the guide by patent.</P>
<P>Near the fir&s;t ford is Chapel I&s;le, on the right from Ulver&s;ton, a barren &s;and, where are yet &s;ome remains of a chapel, built by the monks of Furne&s;s, in which divine &s;ervice was daily performed at a certain hour, for pa&s;&s;engers, who cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ands with the morn|ing tide. The ford is not thought dangerous, though the &s;ands fre|quently &s;hift, for the guide regularly tries for, and a&s;certains, the pro|per pa&s;&s;age. The &s;tream is broad and of formidable appearance, &s;preading rapidly among the &s;ands and, when you enter it, &s;eeming to bear you away in its cour&s;e to the &s;ea. The &s;econd ford is be|yond the penin&s;ula of Cartmel, on the Lanca&s;ter &s;ands, and is formed by the accumulated waters of the rivers, Ken and Win&s;ter, where another guide waits to receive the traveller.</P>
<P>The &s;hores of the Lanca&s;ter &s;ands fall back to greater di&s;tance and are not &s;o bold, or the mountains beyond &s;o awful, as tho&s;e of Ulver|&s;ton; but they are various, often beautiful, and Arn&s;ide-fells have a higher character. The town and ca&s;tle of Lanca&s;ter, on an eminence, gleaming afar off over the level &s;ands and backed by a dark ridge
<PB N="500" REF="508">
of rocky heights, look well as you approach them. Thither we returned and concluded a tour, which had afforded infinite delight in the grandeur of its land&s;capes and a reconciling view of human nature in the &s;implicity, integrity, and friendly di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants.</P>
