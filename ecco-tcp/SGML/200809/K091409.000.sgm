<P>NO &s;ubject is more open to general ob&s;ervation, or more confirmed by manifold experience, than the goodne&s;s of God. The contemplation of the uni|ver&s;e in which we dwell pre&s;entsit per|petually to our view. Amid&s;t the va&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="4">
extent of creation, we di&s;cover no in|&s;tance of mere pomp, or u&s;ele&s;s grandeur, but behold every thing contributing to the general good, and rendered &s;ub&s;er|vient to the welfare of the rational or &s;en&s;ible world. In the admini&s;tration of Providence, the &s;ame principle of bene|ficence is con&s;picuous. The &s;ea&s;ons are made regularly to return, and the earth to flouri&s;h; &s;upply is bountifully provi|ded for the wants of all creatures; and numberle&s;s comforts are prepared to &s;weet|en human life. Mo&s;t ju&s;tly is he who hath e&s;tabli&s;hed, and who upholds, this admirable order of things, to be e&s;teemed the Father of mercies: and, accordingly, in this view, he is often celebrated in &s;crip|ture. <HI>The earth is full of the goodne&s;s of the Lord. His tender mercies are over all his works. His mercy is great unto the heavens; and it endureth for ever.</HI></P>
<P>It appears worthy of particular ob&s;er|vation that there is one light, in which
<PB N="3" REF="5">
more frequently than in any other, the goodne&s;s of God is pre&s;ented to us in the &s;acred writings, namely, the light of com|pa&s;&s;ion to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind. Mo&s;t of the &s;ituations are mentioned in which men are con&s;idered as mo&s;t forlorn; and in &s;ome pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, God is re|pre&s;ented as intere&s;ting him&s;elf, in a pe|culiar manner, for tho&s;e who are in &s;uch &s;ituations. Particular empha&s;is is always laid upon this circum&s;tance, in the gene|ral views which are given of his goodne&s;s. He is the <HI>Hearer of prayer, unto whom all fle&s;h &s;hall come.</HI> But he is de&s;crib|ed as li&s;tening with particular attention to the <HI>cry of the poor;</HI> and <HI>regarding the prayer of the de&s;titute: He will prepare their heart, and cau&s;e his ear to hear.</HI> All creatures are the objects of his providen|tial care. But <HI>the widow and the father|le&s;s, the bowed down and the broken in heart,</HI> are particularly attended to, and commi|&s;erated by him. <HI>The Lord executeth judgement</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
<HI>for the oppre&s;&s;ed; the Lord pre&s;erv|eth the &s;tranger; he loo&s;eth the pri&s;oner, and giveth food to the hungry. He hath not de&s;pi&s;ed nor abborred the affliction of the afflicted; nor hides he his face from them, but hears when they cry unto him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cii. 17, P&s;. x. 17.

In &s;hort, when we are deprived of all hu|man con&s;olation and aid, the Almighty is repre&s;ented as then mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible to our prayers, and mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to help and relieve us.</P>
<P>The words which I have cho&s;en for the text afford a very amiable view of that compa&s;&s;ion which &s;cripture &s;o often a&s;cribes to the Supreme Being. The con|text in which they &s;tand contains much dark and my&s;terious prophecy relating to nations in the neighbourhood of Ju|dea, but leads to no particular illu&s;tration of the text. The words of it, taken by
<PB N="5" REF="7">
them&s;elves, are plainly to be under&s;tood as &s;poken by God to an aged parent, who in the view of approaching di&s;&s;olution, is anxious about the future condition of his family in the world; and they pre&s;ent a mo&s;t affecting di&s;play of God's compa&s;|&s;ionate regard to the children of tho&s;e who have been his faithful &s;ervants on earth. <HI>Leave thy fatherle&s;s children; I will pre&s;erve them alive; and let thy wi|dows tru&s;t in me.</HI>&mdash;It will be worthy of our attention at pre&s;ent, to enquire into the rea&s;ons why the Almighty is plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent him&s;elf &s;o often to us under this view; not only as the ju&s;t and good Ruler of the univer&s;e, which is the fir&s;t and leading idea we naturally form of him, but as the Patron and Friend of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed part of mankind.</P>
<P>It will be found that there are two ve|ry important purpo&s;es which &s;uch di&s;co|veries of the divine nature &s;erve. Fir&s;t, they furni&s;h particular ground for tru&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="8">
in God, amid&s;t all the vici&s;&s;itudes of hu|man life; and next, they exhibit the pat|tern of that di&s;po&s;ition, which we ought, in our mea&s;ure, humbly to follow and i|mitate.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE di&s;coveries of divine compa&s;&s;ion were purpo&s;ely intended to furni&s;h to us particular ground for tru&s;t in God, amid&s;t all the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life. Man, during his abode on earth, is expo&s;ed to various di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Even in his mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing &s;tate, his condition is extremely precarious. Pro&s;perous as he may at one time &s;eem to be, he cannot tell how &s;oon, by &s;ome unfore&s;een vici&s;&s;itude, he may be humbled to the du&s;t; and &s;till le&s;s can he tell what may in future befal his chil|dren, to who&s;e fortunes he often looks with anxious &s;olicitude. In the moments when his mind is oppre&s;&s;ed, either by the immediate feeling of &s;orrows or by the dread of impending evils, it is natural
<PB N="7" REF="9">
for him to fly to that Supreme Being, under who&s;e direction all human events are placed, and earne&s;tly to implore pro|tection, from him.&mdash;But though he hold the belief that ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s are e|ver to be found at the throne of the Al|mighty, yet, even there, particular di&s;|couragements meet him. For that Su|preme Being to whom he looks up is a great and an awful Being. His nature is, to us, unknown. He dwells in the &s;ecret place of Eternity; and is &s;urrounded with clouds and darkne&s;s. We hear his tre|mendous voice in the thunder; and in e|very commotion of the elements we be|hold the irre&s;i&s;tible hand of his power. A nature &s;o infinitely &s;uperior to our own cannot be looked up to without &s;ome mea|&s;ure of di&s;may. It is overwhelming to the timid apprehen&s;ion of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. It is contemplated with that awful and my&s;terious reverence which overpowers confidence and tru&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
It is for this rea&s;on that, in conde&s;cen|&s;ion to human weakne&s;s, God has been plea&s;ed &s;o often to repre&s;ent him&s;elf as ac|tuated by a principle of compa&s;&s;ion and pity. This gives a &s;hade and &s;often|ing to the awful greatne&s;s of the Divinity. It brings down his goodne&s;s to the level of our conception, and fits it to be the object of our tru&s;t. Compa&s;&s;ion is a principle which we all feel and know. We know that it is the &s;tronge&s;t of all the be|nevolent in&s;tincts in our nature, and that it tends directly to intere&s;t us in behalf of tho&s;e who need our aid. We are taught to believe that a &s;imilar attribute belongs to the divine nature; in order that, from that &s;pecies of goodne&s;s which we are be&s;t acquainted with, and which we can mo&s;t rely upon, we may be trained both to love our almighty Benefactor, and as long as we are in the practice of our duty, to tru&s;t to his protection, amid&s;t every di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="9" REF="11">
When we hear &s;uch a voice of ten|derne&s;s, as that which my text utters, pro|ceeding from the Almighty, our hearts are comforted. Di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;may are re|moved. We are no longer oppre&s;&s;ed by his greatne&s;s. We can draw near to him as to a Father in heaven, before whom we can, with humble confidence, pour out our &s;orrows; and can tru&s;t that, though all our earthly friends &s;hould neglect us, our prayers will attract his compa&s;&s;ionate re|gard.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ion, to the unfortunate, as it is exerted among men, is indeed accompa|nied with certain di&s;turbed and painful feelings, ari&s;ing from &s;ympathy with tho&s;e whom we pity. But every &s;uch feeling we mu&s;t remove from our thoughts, when we a&s;cribe an affection of this nature to the Deity. It is true, that, in &s;cripture language, the divine compa&s;&s;ion is &s;ome|times figured by &s;trong allu&s;ions to the relenting &s;truggles and pa&s;&s;ionate meltings
<PB N="10" REF="12">
of the human heart. But we ea&s;ily per|ceive that &s;uch repre&s;entations are to be under&s;tood with the allowances which fi|gurative language requires. All that is amiable in compa&s;&s;ion belongs to God; but all that is imperfect in it mu&s;t be left to man. In the Supreme Being there can be no perturbation or unea&s;ine&s;s; no con|tra&s;t of feelings, nor fluctuation of pur|po&s;e. His compa&s;&s;ion imports a kind re|gard to the circum&s;tances of the unhappy. But &s;till it is &s;uch a regard as &s;uits the perfection of the great Governor of the univer&s;e; who&s;e benignity, undi&s;turbed by any violent emotion, ever maintains the &s;ame tranquil tenor, like the unruffled and uninterrupted &s;erenity of the highe&s;t heavens.</P>
<P>It is important to ob&s;erve, that this pity and compa&s;&s;ion of our heavenly Fa|ther extends it&s;elf to our moral and &s;piri|tual concerns, in like manner as to our natural and external di&s;tre&s;&s;es. In that
<PB N="11" REF="13">
great di&s;pen&s;ation of the redemption of the world by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he is al|ways repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as moved by pity for our fallen and wretched e&s;tate. The &s;ame principle which leads him to regard with compa&s;&s;ion the widow and the fatherle&s;s, led him to look down with compa&s;&s;ion on an helple&s;s and forlorn race, degraded from their original honour. From infinite mercy he &s;ent his Son <HI>to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</HI> According to the prophetical language of the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>He looked upon us; and his time was a time of love. He &s;aw that there was no man; He be|held that there was no interce&s;&s;or, and his own arm brought &s;alvation. He laid his help on one who was mighty to &s;ave. He &s;aw us in our blood, and &s;aid, Live</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xvi. 8. I&s;aiah lix. 16.</NOTE>&mdash;Agreeable to this &s;pirit of compa&s;&s;ion, di&s;|played in our redemption, is the whole di&s;pen&s;ation
<PB N="12" REF="14">
of divine grace towards man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of infirmity. It &s;peaks continually the doctrine of con&s;olation and merciful aid; <HI>grace to be &s;ufficient for us, and &s;trength to be made perfect in our weakne&s;s. As a father pitieth his children, &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him; for he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are du&s;t</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii. 9. P&s;al. ciii. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this head without ob&s;erving how much it adds to the value of the Chri&s;tian religion, that it hath di&s;|covered the Deity to us in a light &s;o amia|ble. When the nations of the earth wor|&s;hipped a God unknown, or one whom they arrayed in nothing but vengeful thunders, the true God hath come forth from behind the cloud, and made him|&s;elf known to us; known, not only as a ju&s;t and good Ruler, but as a compa&s;&s;ion|ate Father, in whom, amid&s;t all their di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the virtuous may tru&s;t and hope. I now proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT &s;uch di&s;coveries of the di|vine nature were de&s;igned, not only to ad|mini&s;ter encouragement and con&s;olation, but al&s;o to exhibit the pattern of that di&s;|po&s;ition which we are bound, in our mea|&s;ure, to imitate and follow. To this pur|po&s;e tend the repeated exhortations of &s;cripture, to <HI>be followers of God, as dear children; to be merciful as our Father in heaven is merciful.</HI> That hardne&s;s of heart which renders men in&s;en&s;ible to the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of their brethren, that in&s;olence of pro&s;perity which in&s;pires them with con|tempt of tho&s;e who are fallen below them, are always repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as di&s;|po&s;itions mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the nature of God, and mo&s;t hateful in his &s;ight. In order to make this appear in the &s;tronge&s;t light, he hath turned his goodne&s;s chiefly into the channel of compa&s;&s;ionate regard
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to tho&s;e whom the &s;elfi&s;h and the proud de&s;pi&s;e. He hath avowedly taken up their cau&s;e, that he might &s;tate him&s;elf as an antagoni&s;t to &s;uch as would bear them down; that he might confound and put to the blu&s;h that arrogance of men which makes them &s;light any of their own bre|thren. <HI>For the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, for the &s;ighing of the needy, now will I ari&s;e, &s;aith the Lord, to &s;et them in &s;afety from him that puffeth at them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xii. 5.</NOTE>. <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>thou ha&s;t heard the de&s;ire of the humble; thou wilt ari&s;e to judge the father|le&s;s, and the oppre&s;&s;ed, that the man of earth may oppre&s;s no more</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. x. 17, 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, I be&s;eech you, whether any virtue can admit of a higher recommenda|tion than its being that di&s;po&s;ition under the character of which the Almighty chu|&s;es to be peculiarly known to us? How can we claim any relation to the Father of
<PB N="15" REF="17">
mercies, or how look up to him for com|pa&s;&s;ion and grace, if we &s;how no bowels of mercy, gentlene&s;s, and kindne&s;s, to one another?&mdash;The whole plan, indeed, on which he hath formed human nature, and all the circum&s;tances in which he hath placed us on earth, are plainly contrived to excite affections of benevolence, and to enforce works of mercy. Not only hath he planted compa&s;&s;ion in the human brea&s;t, as one of the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tincts there, but he hath &s;o connected us in &s;ociety, as ne|ce&s;&s;arily to require that our benevolent in|&s;tincts &s;hould be brought into exerci&s;e. For it is apparent that no man, in any rank of life, even the highe&s;t, is &s;ufficient for his own well-being. He can neither &s;upply his own wants, nor provide for his own comforts, without the co-operation of others. The dependence here is mu|tual between the high and the low, the rich and the poor. Each, in one way or other, calls on each for aid. All are &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="18">
linked together, as to be impelled by a thou&s;and motives to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in the time of need. This is what nature, what &s;ociety, what providence, all &s;peak with a loud voice; a voice which may be &s;aid to have gone forth even to the ends of the earth, and to have been heard and un|der&s;tood by the mo&s;t barbarous tribes of men. For among &s;avage and uncultivat|ed nations, no le&s;s than among the mo&s;t civilized and poli&s;hed, the energy of com|pa&s;&s;ion is felt, and its claims are recogni&s;|ed and obeyed.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of human life, innumera|ble occa&s;ions pre&s;ent them&s;elves for all the exerci&s;es of that humanity and benignity, to which we are &s;o powerfully prompted. The diver&s;ities of rank among men, the changes of fortune to which all, in every rank, are liable, the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor, the wants of helple&s;s youth, the infirmi|ties of declining age, are always giving op|portunities for the di&s;play of humane affections.
<PB N="17" REF="19">
There is perhaps no form in which benevolence appears more intere&s;t|ing, than when it is employed in providing relief for the families and children of tho&s;e who &s;tand in need of aid, in order that the young may be trained up by proper edu|cation for acting an u&s;eful part in the world. Benefits conveyed by this chan|nel are often more important than any o|ther acts of liberality. Be&s;ides the great advantage which they bring to &s;ociety, they have the plea&s;ing effect of awakening all the virtuous &s;en&s;ibilities of the heart, both in tho&s;e who confer, and in tho&s;e who receive them. They are often felt with a warmer reli&s;h by a family in di&s;tre&s;s, and productive of more tender gratitude, than could have been rai&s;ed by any other mode of beneficence. This is rendered &s;en&s;ible to every heart by that beautiful ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the divine compa&s;&s;ion in the text; <HI>Leave thy fatherle&s;s children; I will</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<HI>pre&s;erve them alive; and let thy widows tru&s;t in me.</HI></P>
<P>BY the train of &s;entiment we have pur|&s;ued, your thoughts, my brethren, will now be naturally led to the con&s;ideration of that in&s;titution which has given occa|&s;ion to the meeting of this day; <HI>The Society formed for the benefit of the Sons of the Clergy of the E&s;tabli&s;hed church of Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In entering on this part of the &s;ubject, I tru&s;t that I may be permitted to &s;ay a few words concerning that order of men, in behalf of who&s;e de&s;cendents the favour of the public is now reque&s;ted. Though belonging my&s;elf to that order, yet as my advanced age and long experience may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have corrected the prejudices and cooled the ardour of partiality, &s;ome weight, I hope, will be al|lowed to my te&s;timony; when now, in the fifty-fourth year of my mini&s;try, after hav|ing &s;een &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of mini&s;ters, in various
<PB N="19" REF="21">
parts of the country ri&s;e and fall, and af|ter long acquaintance with many, of di|vided &s;entiments, among my brethren, I can with confidence declare it as my opi|nion, that there exi&s;ts not any where a more re&s;pectable and u&s;eful cla&s;s of men than the Clergy of the Church of Scot|land. Among &s;uch a numerous body, I readily admit that &s;ome exceptions will be found to the character which I now give of them. Con&s;idering human frailty, this is no more than was naturally to be expected. But, taking the mini&s;ters of this church in general, I can venture to a&s;|&s;ert that they are a well-informed and en|lightened &s;et of men; decent and irre|proachable in their behaviour, con&s;cien|tious in the di&s;charge of their pa&s;toral du|ties, and very generally e&s;teemed by the people under their care. There was a time, when the Pre&s;byterian clergy lay un|der the imputation of being &s;our in their tempers, narrow in their opinions, &s;evere
<PB N="20" REF="22">
and intolerant in their principles. But as, together with the diffu&s;ion of know|ledge, a more liberal &s;pirit has pervaded the clerical order in this part of Britain, it will be found that their manners now are conciliating; that they &s;tudy to pro|mote harmony and good order in their pari&s;hes; that they have &s;hown them&s;elves addicted to u&s;eful literature, and in &s;everal branches of it have eminently di&s;tingui&s;h|ed them&s;elves; and that while they are e|difying and con&s;olatory to the lowe&s;t, they have acquired ju&s;t re&s;pect from the higher cla&s;&s;es of men.</P>
<P>As long, therefore, as this country &s;hall be pre&s;erved from the contagion of that fal&s;e philo&s;ophy which, by overthrowing all religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, has engender|ed &s;o much impiety, and wrought &s;o much mi&s;chief, in a neighbouring land; as long as the exi&s;tence of Chri&s;tian faith, and of religious principles, &s;hall be con&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to the welfare of a nation, it may
<PB N="21" REF="23">
rea&s;onably, I think, be expected, that &s;uch a body of men as I have mentioned &s;hall be held entitled to the regard and good will of their fellow citizens and country|men.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tances there are, which give par|ticular occa&s;ion for this regard and good will to be called forth. You all know the nature of that provi&s;ion which is made by the public for the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy of this country. It is &s;uch as is &s;uited to that &s;o|ber and frugal manner of living which is expected from mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. Though, in con&s;ideration of the growing pro&s;perity of the country, and of its natu|ral con&s;equence, the increa&s;ed rate of every expence, it has been found rea&s;onable that, of late years, &s;ome addition &s;hould be made to the provi&s;ion of many of the mi|ni&s;ters, yet &s;till their condition approaches not to what can be termed opulence in any degree. It is &s;uch as to rai&s;e them a|bove contempt; &s;uch as to afford a decent
<PB N="22" REF="24">
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves and their fami|milies; but &s;uch as &s;eldom or never can enable them, without &s;ome other &s;ources of revenue, to make provi&s;ion for their children when going forth into the world, e&s;pecially if their family be numerous.</P>
<P>It was the con&s;ideration of this circum|&s;tance that lately gave ri&s;e to the Society in favour of the Sons of the Clergy. Ma|ny a mini&s;ter who, for a tract of years, has faithfully laboured in the di&s;charge of every duty to his flock, has felt, towards the clo&s;e of his days, what a ble&s;&s;ing it would have proved to him, if &s;uch a &s;o|ciety had exi&s;ted in his time, to which he could have looked for aid&mdash;Repre&s;ent to your&s;elves, my friends, one of this cha|racter,&mdash;and the repre&s;entation which I am now to give is not the work of fancy, but founded upon what often in fact takes place.&mdash;Figure, I &s;ay, a worthy clergy|man, now in the decline of life, fore&s;eeing the end of his labours drawing near, &s;urrounded
<PB N="23" REF="25">
with a family of children, to whom his chief care had been devoted, and and in whom his heart had long been bound up. Their education, from their earlie&s;t years, he had conducted, or at lea&s;t &s;uperintended him&s;elf, with paternal fond|ne&s;s. Whatever his &s;canty &s;tores could afford he had cheerfully expended, in giv|ing all the advantage to their education which his own village, or which the near|e&s;t county town could yield. He had made every preparation that was in his power to make, for their acting a proper part in future life. But the time of pre|paration is fini&s;hed. The gay &s;ea&s;on of childhood is over. The period is arrived when they mu&s;t go forth; mu&s;t leave that paternal man&s;ion where, in the mid&s;t of their youthful companions, they had &s;pent many happy days; mu&s;t go to provide for them&s;elves, the be&s;t they can, in a world which to them is unknown. And whether are they to go?&mdash;Of the few

friends their father ever had, &s;ome are now gone gone down to the du&s;t. Others, with whom he once lived in familiar inti|macy, lifted up now with the pride of o|pulence, have forgotten him and his fa|mily. One of his &s;ons, at lea&s;t, he fondly wi&s;hed to have educated for that profe&s;&s;ion to which he him&s;elf had been &s;o long at|tached. But, living at a di&s;tance from a|ny of the &s;eats of learning, and having no protector to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could look, he feels with regret that he is unable for the attempt. Some of his children he mu&s;t &s;end away to &s;eek their fortune in a di&s;tant land. Others mu&s;t be con&s;igned to the dangers of the ocean, or be reduced to gain their bread by following &s;ome of the mean and laborious occupations of life. Viewing the dark and di&s;couraging pro|&s;pect that is before them, the father's heart is &s;ore, when he bids adieu to his children. With tears in his eyes, he gives them his ble&s;&s;ing as they depart. Little more it is in

his power to give them; but he commits them to the protection of their Father's God.&mdash;How happy, if, in the&s;e mourn|ful moments, a voice of &s;uch a nature as this could reach his ears; <HI>Leave thy fa|therle&s;s children; I will pre&s;erve them alive; and let thy widows tru&s;t in me!</HI></P>
<P>ANIMATED by the de&s;ire of imitating that &s;pirit of divine compa&s;&s;ion which breathes in the&s;e words, a few re&s;pectable gentlemen in this city formed, &s;ix years ago, the plan of a Society for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Sons of the Clergy. The in&s;titution, as &s;oon as it was known, met with public approbation and favour. It was early di&s;tingui&s;hed, and amply a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Roy|al munificence. It was incorporated by Royal charter; and through the genero|&s;ity of the public, has pro&s;pered &s;o far, that the Society has already been enabled to give aid to a con&s;iderable number of the &s;ons of clergymen of this church.
<PB N="26" REF="28">
The aid which the Society, in an infant &s;tate, could as yet give, has been &s;mall; as it is confined to what the intere&s;t of their capital allows them to be&s;tow. They ear|ne&s;tly wi&s;h to become more effectually u&s;eful, by enlarging their provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ion for the education of Sons; and hope to be ena|bled, in due time, to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Daughters as well as to the Sons of mini|&s;ters; &s;o as to afford comfort to a widowed mother, and to the whole of a di&s;con&s;olate family. For, it is to be ob&s;erved, that it is not merely to a literary education, or to preparation for the church, that the in|tentions of the Society are directed. They mean &s;o to apply their beneficence, that the families of mini&s;ters may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to ac|quire the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for pur|&s;uing any u&s;eful employment in the world, for which they appear to be mo&s;t fitted.</P>
<P>Among other inducements which may encourage the public to promote this bene|ficent plan, there is one which I cannot, on
<PB N="27" REF="29">
this occa&s;ion, omit to mention; that is, the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s with which many &s;ons of Scots clergymen have been ble&s;&s;ed, in fill|ing with honour &s;everal of the important departments of Society. As I have not my&s;elf the honour of belonging to that cla&s;s, I can &s;peak with more freedom on this topic than &s;ome other of my brethren. Not to mention the well known and di&s;|tingui&s;hed names of &s;everal who at pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s, with much dignity, &s;tations in the church, and chairs in the univer&s;i|ties, and &s;ome, now gone, who will be long remembered as having done no &s;mall ho|nour, by their literary productions, to this part of the i&s;land; let me de&s;ire you to look round on the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;tations of bu&s;y life, and to con&s;ider how many of tho&s;e who now make a high figure at the bar, &s;ome on the bench, many in the commer|cial, the military, and the naval profe&s;&s;ions, were born and bred under the humble roof of a mini&s;ter.&mdash;Nor is this &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="28" REF="30">
to be a&s;cribed to any favourable coinci|dence of circum&s;tances at this time more than any other. It is the natural re&s;ult of the manner in which they were brought up. Educated in good principles, and formed to &s;ober manners, by pious and vir|tuous parents, they enter on the world le&s;s tainted than others by fa&s;hionable vices and follies. By the &s;ituation of their pa|rents they were inured, from their earlie&s;t youth, to temperance and habits of appli|cation. They come forward, not altoge|ther ignorant and unlettered, like the chil|dren of the meaner cla&s;&s;es of men, but with the foundations of good education and u&s;eful knowledge. At the &s;ame time, they &s;ee and know that it is not to fortune and to friends, but to their own indu&s;try and exertions, they mu&s;t tru&s;t for future &s;ucce&s;s; and that only according to the opinion entertained of their merit, they can hope to be patronized by others. Hence it comes to pa&s;s that young per&s;ons
<PB N="29" REF="31">
of this de&s;cription often advance them|&s;elves more quickly, and act their part more &s;ucce&s;sfully than others who, from their birth and fortune, have enjoyed the benefits of a more improved and orna|mented education; but who&s;e opulence &s;ometimes &s;uper&s;edes labour, encourages indolence, and perhaps fo&s;ters di&s;&s;ipation and love of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The&s;e are con&s;iderations which tend to be&s;peak public favour in behalf of the in|&s;titution which I now recommend. Con|&s;ider, my friends, that by befriending and a&s;&s;i&s;ting it, you contribute to bring for|ward a new race, who, like tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank that have gone before them, may come, in their day, to be beneficial to their country and to the world. It mu&s;t not be forgotten, that a&s;&s;i&s;tance to bring them forward becomes now more nece&s;|&s;ary than it was to the former race, in con&s;equence of the great additional ex|pence which is well known now to attend
<PB N="30" REF="32">
every part of education. By &s;ea&s;onable genero&s;ity, on this occa&s;ion, you may be ripening in &s;ecret the &s;eeds of future ge|nius; you may be bringing forward to maturity tho&s;e young plants which &s;hall flouri&s;h hereafter in the land; and which may perhaps attain &s;uch &s;trength, and ri&s;e to &s;uch a height, as to protect others under their &s;hade.</P>
<P>To the honour of the pre&s;ent age, it mu&s;t be acknowledged not to be deficient in a &s;pirit of humanity. Frequent in&s;tan|ces both of public and private beneficence come forth on every proper occa&s;ion. In this city, many a noble monument appears of charitable foundations and in&s;titutions; &s;ome de&s;tined to educate the children of the needy; others to furni&s;h maintenance for the poor, to provide for the aged, or to receive and relieve the &s;ick and the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed. By their means much timely &s;uccour is given, and many a di&s;tre&s;s is mi|tigated. The in&s;titution for the &s;ake of
<PB N="31" REF="33">
which we are now a&s;&s;embled, partaking of the &s;ame benevolent &s;pirit with the others, reaches to a more re&s;pectable cla&s;s of men, and aims at a more exten&s;ive object. Its purpo&s;e is, to prevent tho&s;e evils which would ari&s;e to the public, from the children of worthy parents being left to langui&s;h in that hopele&s;s indigence which throws them fir&s;t as a burden on &s;ociety, and may afterwards render them a dangerous nu|&s;ance to it. In&s;tead of this, it aims at bringing them into &s;uch a &s;tate as affords a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of their proving u&s;e|ful members of the community, and per|haps of their ranking among its ornaments and &s;upports.</P>
<P>So good a de&s;ign Providence has alrea|dy begun to favour, and we hope will continue to ble&s;s. After we are laid in the du&s;t, the generation that &s;ucceeds us may experience its happy effects. They who now contribute by their genero&s;ity to carry it forward will, in the mean time,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
enjoy the &s;atisfaction of having adopted the benevolent &s;pirit of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion. They will enjoy the &s;atisfaction of having imitated, as they could, that com|pa&s;&s;ion of our heavenly Father which, in &s;o affecting a manner, is expre&s;&s;ed by the words of the text; words, which I hope will continue to dwell, with a la&s;ting and tender impre&s;&s;ion, on all our hearts; <HI>Leave thy fatherle&s;s children; I will pre&s;erve them alive; and let thy widows tru&s;t in me!</HI></P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE SOCIETY INCORPORATED BY ROYAL CHARTER, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SONS OF THE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With a State of its Proceedings, till May 1796.</HEAD>
<P>THE views upon which the Society for the benefit of the Sons of the Clergy of the Church of Scotland was in&s;tituted, and the ob|jects it is de&s;igned to embrace, have been &s;o re|peatedly laid before the public in detail, that, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, it will be &s;ufficient bare|ly to mention them.</P>
<P>It is a fact well known, and univer&s;ally al|lowed, that the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment of North Britain, while it provides the be&s;t &s;ecurities
<PB N="34" REF="36">
for the character, the conduct, the profe&s;&s;ion|al abilities, and the u&s;efulne&s;s of its mini&s;ters, is &s;upported at the &s;ame time at an expence com|paratively &s;maller than that of any other e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church in Europe. The incomes of the Scotch mini&s;ters have always been extremely moderate; and, of late years, from the increa&s;|ed expence, and different mode of living, have unavoidably fallen greatly below the value which they bore in the earlier periods of this century. The change is felt in every part of dome&s;tic concern, and particularly affects the a|bility of many to meet the expence nece&s;&s;ary for procuring to their children an education &s;uited to their &s;ituation, their rank in life, and the pro&s;pects they may rea&s;onably entertain. At the &s;ame time, it will be generally allowed, that, from the advantageous means which the children of clergymen nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;s for receiving in early life the rudiments of li|beral knowledge and impre&s;&s;ions of virtue, it mu&s;t be for the intere&s;t of the public, that young men of this cla&s;s &s;hould have acce&s;s to &s;uch an education as may fit them for the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions to which their abilities and inclinations direct them, and may enable them to come forward with &s;uc|ce&s;s and credit in &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
With a view to afford that aid, both in re&s;pect of patronage and pecuniary &s;upply, without which, this object, however important, might &s;ometimes be unattainable by the families of the mo&s;t de&s;erving clergymen, the SOCIETY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SONS OF THE CLERGY was originally in&s;tituted; its views are not confined to any one di&s;trict of the country, nor limited to the candidates for the church; it comprehends every part of Scotland alike, and the &s;ons of the clergy, whatever profe&s;&s;ion they propo&s;e to embrace; and its benefits, though at pre|&s;ent nece&s;&s;arily limited to the Sons, are meant to be extended to the Daughters of clergymen, as &s;oon as the funds will admit.</P>
<P>The CONSTITUTION of the Society has been formed after mature deliberation, with a view to &s;ecure at once regularity in the management of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and impartiality in the di&s;tri|bution of the funds. Three different bodies are recognized and inve&s;ted with certain pow|ers in the conduct of the in&s;titution;&mdash;the <HI>So|ciety,</HI> the <HI>Sub&s;cribers,</HI> the <HI>Committee of Manage|ment.</HI></P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The <HI>Society.</HI> This body con&s;i&s;ts of the Original Founders of the Society, and other
<PB N="36" REF="38">
Gentlemen elected by ballot from the li&s;t of Sub|&s;cribers. To it are confided the management of the capital &s;tock, in re&s;pect of loans and &s;e|curities, the receipt and di&s;bur&s;ement of money, the general charge of the intere&s;t of the &s;cheme, the nomination of the Officers of the Society, and the review of the reports of the Committee of Management, one half of whom are likewi&s;e elected by it.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>Sub&s;cribers at large,</HI> who meet on a day previou&s;ly intimated, after an annual &s;ermon. The accounts of the Society, both in the receipt and expenditure, are laid before them; and the &s;ub&s;cribers are invited to no|minate from among their own number their proportion of the Committee of Management, without being limited in their choice to &s;uch as are, or &s;uch as are not, members of the So|ciety. If the choice falls on any of the latter de&s;cription, they become, in virtue of this no|mination, members of the Society during the term of their continuance in the Committee. Every Sub&s;criber, to the amount of three guineas or upwards, has a voice in the general annual meeting.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>Committee of Management,</HI> which
<PB N="37" REF="39">
con&s;i&s;ts of nine Gentlemen; four cho&s;en by the Society, four by the Meeting of the Sub&s;cribers, not members of the &s;ociety, and the Pre&s;ident of the Society for the year, in virtue of his office. A new Pre&s;ident is annually cho&s;en; the other Members of the Committee hold their places for four years, and no Gentleman is a &s;econd time eligible, till five years after he has cea&s;ed to be a member. Before this Committee the applica|tions for a&s;&s;i&s;tance are to be laid, and the claims of preference di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and by them the &s;ums proper to be granted in each ca&s;e, are in the fir&s;t in&s;tance &s;pecified and reported to the Society, by whom they are either altered or confirmed.</P>
<P>By this &s;y&s;tem of regulation and controul, the public mu&s;t ever have the be&s;t &s;ecurity which the nature of the ca&s;e can admit, for attention, integrity, impartiality, and fidelity, in the ma|nagement of the funds and conducting the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Society was in&s;tituted in February 1790, and a numerous and re&s;pectable li&s;t of Sub&s;cri|bers to its funds gave the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evi|dence of the general approbation of the de&s;ign. The fir&s;t general meeting of the Society and Sub&s;cribers was held in the Merchants' Hall,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
Edinburgh, on the 31&s;t of May 1791, when the &s;tock of the Society amounted to L. 1005. In January 1792, His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to grant a Royal Charter, con&s;tituting the Society into a legal corporation, by the &s;tyle and title of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Society for the Benefit of the Sons of the Clergy of the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church of Scotland."</Q> This charter, by enabling the Society to hold property, and to receive legacies, beque&s;ts, and donations, will, it is hoped, contribute very ef|fectually to render the advantages of the in&s;titu|tution permanent and certain.</P>
<P>To the generous &s;upport of the public, was added in Feb. 1793, a liberal donation of L. 2000 from His Maje&s;ty. The funds of the in&s;titution were thus rai&s;ed &s;o far, that the Society found them&s;elves able immediately to begin their ope|rations, by allowing a temporary aid to &s;ix young men, who appeared to be proper objects of the Society's attention. That number was increa&s;|ed to 13 at the annual di&s;tribution for 1793, and next year 21 were received upon the li&s;t; the &s;ums allotted to whom amounted in all to L. 120. At the annual di&s;tribution for the year, com|mencing Nov. 1795, the &s;ums allotted amount|ed to L. 150; and the number of young men

a&s;&s;i&s;ted thereby was 25<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Society are re&s;tricted by the terms of their charter, and their laws, from encroaching on their capital; it is the revenue only of their &s;tock which they can employ for the purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution. All donations and beque&s;ts mu&s;t be applied to in|crea&s;e the capital, unle&s;s &s;pecially de&s;tined by the donor to be o|therwi&s;e appropriated. It is always optional, however, to donors to direct the application of the &s;ums be&s;towed, in any mode they incline, either for immediate di&s;tribution to the u&s;ual objects of the Society, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the daughters of clergymen, or for any o|ther &s;pecial purpo&s;e, connected with the de&s;ign of the Society, and con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of its in&s;titution.</NOTE>. The Society did not, however, confine their aid to pecuniary &s;upply, but, in &s;everal in&s;tances, had the &s;atisfaction of being able to obtain for the young men under their charge &s;uch re&s;pectable patronage as pro|mi&s;es to be of e&s;&s;ential utility to their future &s;uc|ce&s;s in life.</P>
