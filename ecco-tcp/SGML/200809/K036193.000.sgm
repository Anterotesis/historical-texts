<HEAD>AN ESTIMATE OF THE <HI>RELIGION</HI> OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE general de&s;ign of the&s;e pages is to offer &s;ome cur&s;ory remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of reli|gion among a great part of the po|lite and the fa&s;hionable; not only among that de&s;cription of per&s;ons,
<PB N="2" REF="8">who, whether from di&s;belief, or what|ever other cau&s;e, avowedly neglect the duties of Chri&s;tianity; but among that more decent cla&s;s al&s;o, who, while they acknowledge their belief of its truth by a public profe&s;&s;ion, and are not inattentive to any of its forms, yet exhibit little of its &s;pirit in their general temper and conduct: to &s;hew that Chri&s;tianity, like its divine Author, is not only <HI>denied</HI> by tho&s;e who in words di&s;own their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to its authority, but <HI>be|trayed</HI> by &s;till more treacherous di&s;|ciples, even while they &s;ay, <HI>Hail Ma&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">For this vi&s;ible declen&s;ion of piety, various rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned, &s;ome of which however do not &s;eem fully adequate to the effects a&s;cribed to them. The author of a late po|pular <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hints to an A&s;&s;ociation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> pamphlet has accounted for the increa&s;ed profligacy of the <HI>com|mon people,</HI> by a&s;cribing it, very ju&s;t|ly, to the increa&s;ed di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of their &s;uperiors: and who will deny what he affirms, that the general conduct of high and low receives a deep tincture of depravity from the growing neglect of public wor&s;hip? I mu&s;t however take the liberty to
<PB N="4" REF="10">di&s;&s;ent from his opinion as to the cau&s;e of that neglect, and to &s;u&s;pect that the too common de&s;ertion of per&s;ons of rank from the &s;ervice of the E&s;tabli&s;hment is not occa&s;ioned, in general, by their di&s;approbation of the Liturgy; but that the far greater part of them are deterred from going to church, by motives far removed from &s;peculative ob|jections and con&s;cientious &s;cruples.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to enter the unplea&s;ant and boundle&s;s fields of controver&s;y; an enterpri&s;e, for which it would be hard to &s;ay whether I
<PB N="5" REF="11">have le&s;s ability or inclination. Far be it from me to &s;tand forth the fierce champion of a Liturgy, or the prejudiced advocate of &s;orms and &s;y&s;tems. A &s;incere member of the E&s;tabli&s;hment my&s;elf, I re&s;pect its in&s;titutions without idolatry, and ac|knowledge its imperfections without palliation.</P>
<P>But the difference of opinion here intimated is not &s;o much about the Liturgy it&s;elf, as its imagined effects in thinning the pews of our people of fa&s;hion. The &s;lighte&s;t degree of ob&s;ervation &s;eems to contradict this
<PB N="6" REF="12">a&s;&s;ertion: tho&s;e however who main|tain the other opinion may &s;atisfy their doubts, by enquiring whether the regular and &s;y&s;tematic ab&s;enters from church are chiefly to be found among the thinking, the reading, the &s;peculative and the &s;crupulous part of mankind.</P>
<P>Even the mo&s;t negligent attendant on public wor&s;hip mu&s;t know that the obnoxious creed, to who&s;e ma|lignant potency this general de&s;er|tion is a&s;cribed, is never read above three of four &s;undays in a year; and that does not &s;eem a very adequate
<PB N="7" REF="13">rea&s;on for bani&s;hing the mo&s;t &s;cru|pulous and tender con&s;ciences from church on the other eight and forty &s;undays.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is one te&s;t which is ab&s;olutely unequivocal&mdash;it is never read at all in the <HI>afternoon,</HI> any more than the Litany (another great &s;ource of offence); and yet, with all the&s;e multiplied rea&s;ons for their atten|dance, that is a &s;ea&s;on when the pews of the fa&s;hionable world are not <HI>remarkable</HI> for being crowded.</P>
<P>On the contrary, is it not pretty
<PB N="8" REF="14">evident, that the general quarrel (with &s;ome few exceptions) of tho&s;e who habitually ab&s;ent them&s;elves from public wor&s;hip, is not with the Creed, but the Commandments? With &s;uch, to reform the Prayer Book would go but a little way, unle&s;s the New Te&s;tament could be al&s;o abridged. Cut, and pare, and prune the &s;ervice of the Church ever &s;o much, &s;till Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf will be found full of formidable objec|tions. With &s;uch objectors, it would avail but little that the Church &s;hould give up her ab&s;tru&s;e creeds, unle&s;s the Bible would ex|punge
<PB N="9" REF="15">tho&s;e rigorous laws, which not only prohibit &s;inful actions, but corrupt inclinations. And, to &s;peak hone&s;tly, I do not &s;ee how &s;uch per|&s;ons as habitually infringe the laws of virtue and &s;obriety, and who yet are men of acute &s;agacity, accu&s;tomed on other &s;ubjects to a con&s;i&s;tent train of rea&s;oning; who &s;ee con&s;e|quences in their cau&s;es; who behold practical &s;elf-denial nece&s;&s;arily in|volved in the &s;incere habit of reli|gious ob&s;ervances&mdash;I do not &s;ee how to &s;uch men, any doctrines reformed, any redundancies lopped,
any ob&s;curitites brightened, could
<PB N="10" REF="16">effect this author's very benevolent and chri&s;tian wi&s;h.</P>
<P>For religious duties are often neg|lected, upon more con&s;i&s;tent grounds than the friends of religion are will|ing to allow. They are often di&s;|continued, not as repugnant to the under&s;tanding, not as repul&s;ive to the judgment, but as ho&s;tile to a licentious life. And when a prudent man, after entering into a &s;olemn convention, finds that he is living in a con&s;tant breach of every article of the treaty he has engaged to ob&s;erve; one cannot much wonder at his get|ting
<PB N="11" REF="17">out of the hearing of the heavy artillery which he knows is planted again&s;t him, and again&s;t every one who lives in an allowed infraction of the covenant.</P>
<P>A man of &s;en&s;e, who &s;hould ac|knowledge the truth of the doctrine, would find him&s;elf obliged to &s;ub|mit to the force of the precept. It is not ea&s;y to be a comfortable &s;in|ner, without trying, at lea&s;t, to be a confirmed unbeliever. The &s;malle&s;t remains of faith would embitter a life of libertini&s;m; and to him who retains any impre&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="12" REF="18">the wilde&s;t fe&s;tivals of intemperance will be converted into the terrifying fea&s;t of Damocles; the &s;u&s;pended &s;word may every moment fall.</P>
<P>That many a worthy noncon|formi&s;t is kept out of the pale of the E&s;tabli&s;hment by &s;ome of the cau&s;es noticed in the pamphlet in que&s;tion, cannot be doubted; and that many candid members of that E&s;tabli&s;hment regret the cau&s;es which exclude the others, cannot be denied. But the&s;e are often &s;ober thinkers, &s;erious enquirers, con&s;ci|entious rea&s;oners; who&s;e object is
<PB N="13" REF="19">truth, and who &s;pare no pains in &s;earch of what they take to <HI>be</HI> truth. But that the &s;ame objections bani&s;h the great and the gay, is not equally evident. Thanks to the indolence and di&s;&s;ipation of the times, it is not dogmas or doctrines; it is not ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, or puzzling pro|po&s;itions; it is not perplexed argu|ment or intricate metaphy&s;ics, which can now di&s;incline from Chri&s;tianity: &s;o far from it, they cannot even allure to unbelief. Infidelity it&s;elf, with all that &s;trong and natural bias which pa&s;&s;ion and appetite have in its fa|vour, if it appear in the grave and
<PB N="14" REF="20">&s;chola&s;tic form of &s;peculation, argu|ment, or philo&s;ophical deduction, may lie almo&s;t as quietly on the &s;helf as its mo&s;t able antagoni&s;t; and the cobwebs are almo&s;t as &s;el|dom bru&s;hed from Hobbes as from Hooker. No: prudent &s;ceptici&s;m has wi&s;ely &s;tudied the temper of the times, and &s;kilfully felt the pul&s;e of this relaxed and indolent age. It prudently accommodated it&s;elf to the reigning character, when it a|dopted &s;arca&s;m in&s;tead of rea&s;oning, and preferred a &s;neer to an argu|ment. It di&s;creetly judged, that, if it would now gain pro&s;elytes, it mu&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="21">&s;hew it&s;elf under the bewitching form of a prophane bon-mot; mu&s;t be interwoven in the texture of &s;ome amu&s;ing hi&s;tory, written with the levity of a romance, and the point and glitter of an epigram: it mu&s;t embelli&s;h the ample margin with &s;ome offen&s;ive anecdote or impure allu&s;ion, and decorate impiety with every loo&s;e and meretricious orna|ment of a corrupt imagination: it mu&s;t break up the old flim&s;y &s;y&s;tem into little mi&s;chievous aphori&s;ms, ready for practical purpo&s;es: it mu&s;t divide the rope of &s;and into little portable parcels, which the &s;hallow|e&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="22">wit can comprehend, and the &s;horte&s;t memory carry away.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy therefore (as Unbelief, by a patent of its own creation, has lately been plea&s;ed to call it&s;elf) will not do nearly &s;o much mi&s;chief to the pre&s;ent age, as its great apo&s;tles intended; &s;ince it requires time, ap|plication, and patience to peru&s;e the rea&s;oning veterans of the &s;ceptic &s;chool; and the&s;e are talents not now very &s;everely devoted to &s;tudy of any &s;ort, by tho&s;e who give the law to fa&s;hion; e&s;pecially &s;ince, as it was hinted above, the &s;ame princi|ples
<PB N="17" REF="23">may be acquired on cheaper terms, and the reputation of being philo&s;ophers obtained without the &s;acrifices of plea&s;ure for the &s;everities of &s;tudy; &s;ince the indu&s;try of our literary chemi&s;ts has extracted the &s;pirit from the gro&s;s &s;ub&s;tance of the old unvendible poi&s;on, and exhibited it in the volatile e&s;&s;ence of a few &s;prightly &s;ayings.</P>
<P>If therefore, in this voluptuous age, when a frivolous and relaxing di&s;&s;ipation has infected our very &s;tudies, infidelity will not be at the pains of deep re&s;earch and elaborate inve&s;tigation, even on &s;uch &s;ubjects
<PB N="18" REF="24">as are congenial to its affections; it is vain to expect that chri&s;tianity will be more engaging, either as an object of &s;peculation, or a rule of practice, when its evidences require attention to be comprehended, its doctrines humility to be received, and its precepts &s;elf-denial to be embraced.</P>
<P>Will it then be uncharitable to pronounce that the leading evil, not which thins our churches (for that is not the evil I propo&s;e to con&s;ider), but which pervades our whole cha|racter, and gives the colour to our
<PB N="19" REF="25">general conduct, is <HI>practical irreli|gion?</HI> an irreligion not &s;o much op|po&s;ed to a &s;peculative faith, as to that &s;pirit, temper, and behaviour which chri&s;tianity inculcates.</P>
<P>On this practical irreligion it is propo&s;ed to offer a few hints. After attempting to &s;hew, by a compari&s;on with the religion of the great in pre|ceding ages, that there is a vi&s;ible decline of piety among the higher ranks&mdash;that even tho&s;e more libe|ral &s;pirits who neglect not many of the great duties of benevolence, yet hold the &s;everer obligations of piety
<PB N="20" REF="26">in no e&s;teem&mdash;I &s;hall proceed, though perhaps with too little me|thod, to remark on the notorious <HI>effects</HI> of the decay of this religious principle, as it corrupts our mode of education, infects dome&s;tic conduct, &s;preads the contagion downwards among &s;ervants and inferiors, and influences our manners, habits, and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But what it is here propo&s;ed principally to in&s;i&s;t on is, that this defect of religious principle is almo&s;t equally fatal, whether it appear in the open contempt of all &s;acred in|&s;titutions,
<PB N="21" REF="27">or under the more decent veil of external ob&s;ervances, un&s;up|ported by &s;uch a conduct as is ana|logous to the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed with a few remarks on a third cla&s;s of fa&s;hionable cha|racters, who profe&s;s to acknowledge chri&s;tianity as a perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, while they deny its divine authority: and conclude with &s;ome &s;light animadver&s;ions on the opinion which the&s;e maintain, that morality is the whole of religion.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that manners and principles act re|ciprocally
<PB N="22" REF="28">on each other; and are, by turns, cau&s;e and effect. For in|&s;tance&mdash;the increa&s;ed relaxation of morals produces the increa&s;ed neg|lect of infu&s;ing religious principles in the education of youth: which effect becomes, in its turn, a cau&s;e; and in due time, when that cau&s;e comes to operate, helps on the de|cline of manners.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Decline of chri&s;tianity &s;hewn by a comparative view of the religion of the great in pre|ceding ages.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF the general po&s;ition of this lit|tle tract be allowed, namely, that religion is at pre&s;ent in no very flouri&s;hing &s;tate among tho&s;e, who&s;e example, from the high ground on which they &s;tand, guides and governs the re&s;t of mankind;
<PB N="24" REF="30">it will not be denied by tho&s;e, who are ever &s;o &s;uperficially acquainted with the hi&s;tory of our country, that this has not always been the ca&s;e. Tho&s;e who make a fair com|pari&s;on mu&s;t allow, that however the pre&s;ent age may be improved in other important and valuable ad|vantages, yet that there is but little appearance remaining among the great and the powerful of that "righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation;"&mdash;that there has been a <HI>moral revolution</HI> in the national man|ners and principles, very little ana|logous to that great <HI>political</HI> one of
<PB N="25" REF="31">which we hear &s;o much; that our public virtue bears little proportion to our public ble&s;&s;ings; and that our religion has decrea&s;ed in a pretty exact proportion to our having &s;e|cured the means of enjoying it.</P>
<P>That the antipodes to wrong are hardly ever right, was very &s;trikingly illu&s;trated about the middle of the la&s;t century, when the fiery and in|di&s;creet zeal of one party was made a pretext for the profligate impiety of the other; who, to the bad prin|ciple which dictated a depraved con|duct, added the bad ta&s;te of being
<PB N="26" REF="32">proud of it:&mdash;when even the lea&s;t abandoned were ab&s;urdly appre|hen&s;ive that an appearance of de|cency might &s;ubject them to the charge of fanatici&s;m, a charge in which they took care to involve real piety as well as enthu&s;ia&s;tic pretence; till it became the general fa&s;hion to avoid no &s;in but hypocri&s;y, to dread no imputation but that of &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, and to be more afraid of a good reputation than of every vice which ever earned a bad one.</P>
<P>It was not till piety was thus un|fortunately
<PB N="27" REF="33">brought into di&s;repute, that per&s;ons of condition thought it made their &s;incerity, their abilities, or their good breeding que&s;tionable, to appear openly on the &s;ide of reli|gion. A &s;trict attachment to piety did not &s;ubtract from a great repu|tation. Men were not thought the wor&s;e lawyers, generals, mini&s;ters, legi&s;lators, or hi&s;torians, for believ|ing, and even defending, the religion of their country. The gallant Sir Philip Sidney, the ra&s;h but heroic E&s;&s;ex, the politic and &s;agacious Bur|leigh, the all-accompli&s;hed Falk|land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Falkland a&s;&s;i&s;ted the great Chillings worth in his incomparable work, The Religion of a Prote&s;tant.</NOTE>,
<PB N="28" REF="34">not only publicly owned their belief in chri&s;tianity, but even wrote &s;ome things of a religious nature <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See that equally elegant and authentic work, <HI>The Anecdotes of Royal and Noble Al|thons.</HI></NOTE> The&s;e in&s;tances, and many others which might be ad|duced, are not, it will be allowed, &s;elected from among contemplative reclu&s;es, grave divines, or authors by profe&s;&s;ion; but from bu&s;y men
<PB N="29" REF="35">of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, be&s;et with great temptations; di&s;tingui&s;hed actors on the &s;tage of life; and who&s;e re&s;pective claims to the title of fine gentlemen, brave &s;oldiers, or able &s;tate&s;men, have never been called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>What would the Hales, and the Clarendons, and the Somers's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This con&s;ummate &s;tate&s;man was not only remarkable for a &s;trict attendance on the public duties of religion, but for maintaining them with equal exactne&s;s in his family, at a period too when religion was mo&s;t di&s;countenanced.</NOTE> have &s;aid, had they been told that the
<PB N="30" REF="36">time was at no great di&s;tance, when that &s;acred book, for which they thought it no derogation from their wi&s;dom or their dignity to entertain the profounde&s;t reverence, would be of little more u&s;e to men in high public &s;tations, than to be the in&s;tru|ment of an oath; and that the &s;ub|lime&s;t rites of the chri&s;tian religion would &s;oon be con&s;idered as little more than a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for a place, or the legal preliminary to an office.</P>
<P>This indeed is the boa&s;ted period of free enquiry and liberty of think|ing,
<PB N="31" REF="37">and a noble &s;ubject of boa&s;ting it is: but it is the peculiar character of the pre&s;ent age, that its mi&s;chiefs often a&s;&s;ume the mo&s;t alluring forms; and that the mo&s;t alarming evils not only look &s;o like goodne&s;s as to be often mi&s;taken for it, but are &s;ome|times mixed up with &s;o much real good, as often to di&s;gui&s;e, though never to counteract, their malignity. Under the beautiful ma&s;k of an en|lightened philo&s;ophy, all religious re&s;traints are &s;et at nought; and &s;ome of the deadlie&s;t wounds have been aimed at chri&s;tianity, in works written in avowed vindication of
<PB N="32" REF="38">the mo&s;t amiable of all the chri&s;tian principles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particularly <HI>Voltaire &s;ur la Tolerance.</HI> This is a common artifice of that engaging but in&s;idious author. In this in&s;tance he has made u&s;e of the popularity he obtained in the fanatical tragedy at Thoulou&s;e (the murder of Calas) to di&s;credit, though in the mo&s;t guarded manner, chri&s;tianity it&s;elf; degrading martyrdom, denying the truth of the Pagan per&s;ecutions, &amp;c. &amp;c. And by mixing &s;ome truths with many fal&s;ehoods, by a&s;&s;uming an amiable candour, and profe&s;&s;ing to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of goodne&s;s, he treacherou&s;ly contrives to leave on the mind of the unguarded reader impre&s;&s;ions the mo&s;t unfavourable to chri&s;|tianity.</NOTE> Even the prevalence of a liberal and warm philanthropy

<P>The &s;trong and generous bias in favour of univer&s;al toleration, noble as the principle it&s;elf is, has engen|dered a dangerous notion that all error is innocent. Whether it be owing to this, or to whatever other cau&s;e, it is certain that the di&s;crimi|nating
<PB N="34" REF="40">features of the chri&s;tian reli|gion are every day growing into le&s;s repute; and it is become the fa&s;hion, even among the better &s;ort, to evade, to lower, or to generalize, its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing peculiarities <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is &s;o little of the Author of chri&s;|tianity left in his own religion, that an appre|hen&s;ive believer is ready to exclaim, with the woman at the &s;epulchre, "they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him."

<P><PB N="35" REF="41">Having wi&s;ely and happily freed our&s;elves from the trammels of human authority, are we not turning our liberty into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and wantonly &s;truggling to throw off the <HI>divine</HI> authority too? Freedom of thought is the glory of the human mind, while it is confined within its ju&s;t and &s;ober limits; but though we are accountable for <HI>opinions</HI> at no earthly tribunal, yet it &s;hould be re|membered that thoughts as well as actions are amenable to the bar of God: and though we may rejoice that the tyranny of the &s;piritual Procru&s;tes is &s;o far annihilated, that

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Benevolence allowed to be the reigning virtue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but not <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> the virtue of the pre|&s;ent age. Benevolence not the whole of religion, though one of its mo&s;t characteri&s;tic features. Whether benevolence proceed from a religious principle, will be more infallibly known by the general di&s;po&s;ition of time, fortune, and the common habits of life, than from a few occa&s;ional acts of bounty.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO all the remon&s;trance and in|vective of the preceding chap|ter, there will not fail to be oppo&s;ed
<PB N="42" REF="48">that which we hear every day &s;o loudly in&s;i&s;ted on&mdash;the decided &s;u|periority of the pre&s;ent age, in other and better re&s;pects. It will be &s;aid that even tho&s;e who neglect the out|ward forms of religion, exhibit how|ever the be&s;t proofs of the be&s;t prin|ciples; that the unparalleled in&s;tances of charity of which we are continual witne&s;&s;es; that the many &s;triking acts of public bounty, and the vari|ous new and noble improvements in this &s;hining virtue, ju&s;tly entitle the pre&s;ent age to be called, by way of eminence, <HI>the age of benevolence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49">It is with the livelie&s;t joy I ac|knowledge the delightful truth. Li|berality flows with a full tide through a thou&s;and channels. There is &s;carcely a new&s;paper but records &s;ome meeting of men of fortune for the mo&s;t &s;alutary purpo&s;es. The noble and numberle&s;s &s;tructures for the relief of di&s;tre&s;s, which are the ornament and the glory of our me|tropolis, proclaim a &s;pecies of mu|nificence unknown to former ages. Sub&s;criptions, not only to ho&s;pitals, but to various other valuable in&s;titu|tions, are obtained almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;olicited. And who but mu&s;t wi&s;h
<PB N="44" REF="50">that the&s;e beautiful monuments of benevolence may become every day more numerous and more extended?</P>
<P>Yet with all the&s;e allowed and ob|vious excellencies, it is not quite clear whether &s;omething too much has not been &s;aid of the liberality of the pre&s;ent age, in a comparative view with that of tho&s;e ages which preceded it. A general alteration of habits and manners has at the &s;ame time multiplied public boun|ties and private di&s;tre&s;s; and it is &s;carcely a paradox to &s;ay, that there
<PB N="45" REF="51">was probably le&s;s mi&s;ery when there was le&s;s munificence.</P>
<P>If an increa&s;ed benevolence now ranges through and relieves a wider compa&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s; yet &s;till, if tho&s;e examples of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation which promote that di&s;tre&s;s are &s;till <HI>more</HI> increa&s;ed, this makes the good done bear little proportion to the evil promoted. If the mi&s;eries re|moved by the growth of charity fall, both in number and weight, far below tho&s;e which are cau&s;ed by the growth of vice and di&s;order; if we find that though bounty is extended,
<PB N="46" REF="52">yet that tho&s;e corruptions which make bounty &s;o nece&s;&s;ary are extended al&s;o, almo&s;t beyond calculation; if it appear that, though more objects are relieved by our money, yet in|comparably more are debauched by our licentiou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;the balance per|haps will not turn out &s;o decidedly in favour of the times as we are will|ing to imagine.</P>
<P>If then the mo&s;t valuable &s;pecies of charity is that which prevents di&s;tre&s;s by preventing or le&s;&s;ening vice, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t inevitable cau&s;e of want; we ought not &s;o
<PB N="47" REF="53">highly to exalt the bounty of the great in the pre&s;ent day, in prefe|rence to that broad &s;hade of protec|tion, patronage, and maintenance, which the wide-&s;pread bounty of their forefathers &s;tretched out over whole villages, I had almo&s;t &s;aid whole provinces. When a few noblemen in a county, like a few of their own &s;tately oaks (paternal oaks! which were not often &s;et upon a card), extended their &s;heltering branches to &s;hield all the underwood of the fore&s;t&mdash;when there exi&s;ted a kind of pa&s;&s;ive charity, a negative &s;ort of benevolence, which did good
<PB N="48" REF="54">of it&s;elf; and without effort, exer|tion, or expence, performed the be&s;t functions of bounty, though it did not a&s;pire to the dignity of its name&mdash; it was &s;imply this:&mdash;great people &s;taid at home; and the &s;ober pomp and orderly magnificence of a noble family, re&s;iding at their own ca&s;tle great part of the year, contributed in the mo&s;t natural way to the main|tenance of the poor; and in a good degree prevented that di&s;tre&s;s, which it mu&s;t however thankfully be con|fe&s;&s;ed it is the laudable object of modern bounty to relieve. A man of fortune might not then, it is true,
<PB N="49" REF="55">&s;o often dine in public, for the benefit of the poor; but the poor were more regularly and comfort|ably fed with the abundant crumbs which then fell from the rich man's table. Whereas it cannot be denied that the prevailing mode of living has pared real ho&s;pitality to the very quick: and, though the remark may be thought ridiculous, it is a material di&s;advantage to the poor, that the introduction of the modern &s;tyle of luxury has rendered the remains of the mo&s;t co&s;tly table but of &s;mall value.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="56">But even allowing the boa&s;ted &s;uperiority of modern benevolence, &s;till it will not be incon&s;i&s;tent with the object of the pre&s;ent de&s;ign, to enquire whether the diffu&s;ion of this branch of charity, though the mo&s;t lovely offspring of religion, be yet any po&s;itive proof of the prevalence of religious principle: and whether it is not the fa&s;hion rather to con&s;ider benevolence as a &s;ub&s;titute for chri&s;|tianity, than as an evidence of it.</P>
<P>For it &s;eems to be one of the reigning errors among the better &s;ort, to reduce all religion into bene|volence,
<PB N="51" REF="57">and all benevolence into alms-giving. The wide and com|prehen&s;ive idea of chri&s;tian charity is compre&s;&s;ed into the &s;lender compa&s;s of a little pecuniary relief. This &s;pe|cies of benevolence is indeed a bright gem among the ornaments of a chri&s;|tian; but by no means furni&s;hes all the jewels of his crown, which de|rives its lu&s;tre from the a&s;&s;ociated radiance of every chri&s;tian grace. Be&s;ides, the genuine virtues are all of the &s;ame family; and it is only by being &s;een in company with each other, and with Piety their common parent, that they are certainly known
<PB N="52" REF="58">to be legitimate; for there are &s;uch things as even &s;purious virtues.</P>
<P>But it is the property of the <HI>chri&s;|tian</HI> virtues, that, like all other ami|able members of the &s;ame family, while each is doing its own particular duty, it is contributing to the pro|&s;perity of the re&s;t; and the larger the family the better they live toge|ther, as no one can advance it&s;elf without labouring for the advance|ment of the whole: thus, no man can be benevolent on chri&s;tian prin|ciples, without &s;elf-denial; and &s;o of the other virtues: each is connected
<PB N="53" REF="59">with &s;ome other, and all with re|ligion.</P>
<P>I already anticipate the obvious and hackneyed reply, that "who|ever be the in&s;trument, and what|ever be the motive of bounty, &s;till the poor are equally relieved, and therefore the end is the &s;ame." And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that tho&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate hearts, who cannot but be earne&s;tly anxious that the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;hould be relieved at any rate, &s;hould not too &s;crupulou&s;ly enquire into any cau&s;e of which the effect is &s;o beneficial. Nor indeed
<PB N="54" REF="60">will candour &s;crutinize too curiou&s;ly into the errors of any life, of which benevolence will always be allowed to be a &s;hining ornament, while it does not pretend to be an atoning virtue.</P>
<P>Let me not be mi&s;repre&s;ented as if I were &s;eeking to detract from the value of this amiable feeling; one does not &s;urely lower the prac|tice by &s;eeking to ennoble the princi|ple; the action will not be impaired by mending the motive: and no one will be likely to give the poor le&s;s becau&s;e he &s;eeks to plea&s;e God more.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="61">One cannot then help wi&s;hing that pecuniary bounty were not only practi&s;ed, but &s;ometimes enjoined too, as a redeeming virtue. In many conver&s;ations, I had almo&s;t &s;aid in many charity &s;ermons, it is in&s;inuated as if a little alms-giving could pay off old &s;cores contracted by favourite indulgences. This, though often done by well-meaning men to advance the intere&s;ts of &s;ome pre&s;ent pious purpo&s;e, yet has the mi&s;chievous effect of tho&s;e medicines which, while they may relieve a local complaint, are yet undermining the general habit.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62">That great numbers who are not influenced by &s;o high a principle as chri&s;tianity holds out, are yet truly compa&s;&s;ionate, without hypocri&s;y, and without o&s;tentation, who can doubt? &s;ince there are by nature many tender hearts; for did not God make them? and is he not the Author of all that is good in nature, as well as in grace?</P>
<P>But who that feels the beauty of benevolence, can avoid being &s;oli|citous, not only that its offerings &s;hould comfort the receiver, but re|turn in ble&s;&s;ings to the bo&s;om of the
<PB N="57" REF="63">giver, by &s;pringing from &s;uch mo|tives, and being accompanied by &s;uch a temper as &s;hall redound to his eternal good? For that the bene|fit is the &s;ame to the object, whatever be the character of the benefactor, is but an uncomfortable view of things to a real chri&s;tian, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion reaches to the &s;ouls of men. Such an one longs to &s;ee the charitable giver as happy as he is endeavouring to make the object of his bounty; but &s;uch an one knows that no hap|pine&s;s can be fully and finally en|joyed but on the &s;olid ba&s;is of chri&s;|tian piety.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64">For as religion is not, on the one hand, merely an opinion or a &s;enti|ment; &s;o neither is it, on the other, merely an act or a performance; but it is a di&s;po&s;ition, a habit, a temper: it is not a name, but a nature: it is a turning the whole mind to God; a concentration of all the powers and affections of the &s;oul into one &s;teady point, an uniform de&s;ire to plea&s;e <HI>Him.</HI> This de&s;ire will naturally and nece&s;&s;arily manife&s;t it&s;elf, in our doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures in every po&s;&s;ible way; for it will be found that neither of the two parts into which
<PB N="59" REF="65">practical religion is divided, can be performed with any degree of per|fection but by tho&s;e who unite both: as it may be que&s;tioned if any man really <HI>does</HI> "love his neighbour as him&s;elf," who does not fir&s;t endea|vour to "love God with all his heart." As genius has been de|fined to be &s;trong general powers of mind accidentally determined to &s;ome particular pur&s;uit; &s;o piety may be denominated a &s;trong general di&s;po&s;ition of the heart to every thing that is right, breaking forth into every excellent action, as the occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf. The temper
<PB N="60" REF="66">mu&s;t be ready in the mind, and the whole heart mu&s;t be prepared and trained to every act of virtue to which it may be called out. For religious principles are like the mili|tary exerci&s;e; they keep up an habi|tual &s;tate of preparation for actual &s;ervice; and by never relaxing the di&s;cipline, the real chri&s;tian is ready for every duty to which he may be commanded. Right actions be&s;t prove the exi&s;tence of religion in the heart; but they are evidences, not cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Whether therefore a man's chari|table
<PB N="61" REF="67">actions proceed from religious principle, he will be be&s;t able to a&s;|certain by &s;crutinizing into what is the general di&s;po&s;ition of his time and fortune; and by attending to &s;uch an habitual regulation of his plea&s;ures and expences as will en|able him to be more or le&s;s u&s;eful to others.</P>
<P>For it is in vain that he may po&s;|&s;e&s;s, what is called by the courte&s;y of fa&s;hion <HI>the be&s;t heart in the world</HI> (a character we every day hear ap|plied to the libertine and the pro|digal), if he &s;quander his time and
<PB N="62" REF="68">e&s;tate in &s;uch a round of extravagant indulgences, and thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipa|tion, as leaves him little money and le&s;s lei&s;ure for nobler purpo&s;es. It makes but little difference whether a man is prevented from doing good by hard-hearted par&s;imony or an un|principled extravagance; the &s;tream is equally cut off.</P>
<P>The mere <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> benevolence of any man can have little claim to &s;olid e&s;teem; nor does any charity de&s;erve the name which does not grow out of a &s;teady conviction that it is his bounden duty; which does
<PB N="63" REF="69">not &s;pring from a &s;ettled propen&s;ity to obey the whole will of God; which is not therefore made a part of the general plan of his conduct; and which does not lead him to order the whole &s;cheme of his affairs with an eye to it.</P>
<P>He therefore who does not habi|tuate him&s;elf to certain interior re|&s;traints, who does not live in a regular cour&s;e of &s;elf-renunciation, will not be likely often to perform acts of beneficence, when it becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary to convert to &s;uch purpo&s;es any of that time or money which
<PB N="64" REF="70">appetite, temptation, or vanity &s;olicit him to divert to other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>And &s;urely he who &s;eldom &s;acri|fices one darling indulgence, who does not &s;ubtract one gratification from the ince&s;&s;ant round of his en|joyments, when the indulgence would ob&s;truct his capacity of doing good, or when the &s;acrifice would enlarge his power, does not de&s;erve the name of benevolent. And for &s;uch an unequivocal criterion of charity to whom are we to look, but to the con&s;cientious chri&s;tian? No other &s;pirit but that by which he is go|verned,
<PB N="65" REF="71">can &s;ubdue &s;elf-love; and where &s;elf-love is the predominant pa&s;&s;ion, benevolence can have but a feeble, or an accidental dominion.</P>
<P>Now if we look around and re|mark the exce&s;&s;es of luxury, the co&s;tly diver&s;ions, and the intempe|rate di&s;&s;ipation in which numbers of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians indulge them|&s;elves, can any &s;tretch of candour, can even that tender &s;entiment by which we are enjoined "to hope" and to "believe all things," enable us to hope and believe that &s;uch are actuated by a &s;pirit of chri&s;tian bene|volence,
<PB N="66" REF="72">merely becau&s;e we &s;ee them perform &s;ome ca&s;ual acts of charity, which the &s;pirit of the world can contrive to make extremely com|patible with a voluptuous life, and the co&s;t of which, after all, bears but little proportion to that of any one vice, or even vanity?</P>
<P>Men will not believe that there is hardly any one human good quality which will know and keep its proper bounds, without the re&s;training in|fluence of religious principle. There is, for in&s;tance, great danger le&s;t a con&s;tant attention to &s;o right a prac|tice
<PB N="67" REF="73">as an invariable oeconomy &s;hould incline the heart to the love of money. Nothing can effectually counteract this natural propen&s;ity but the chri&s;tian habit of devoting tho&s;e retrenched expences to &s;ome good purpo&s;e; and then oeconomy, in&s;tead of narrowing the heart, will enlarge it, by inducing a con&s;tant a&s;&s;ociation of benevolence with fru|gality. An habitual attention to the wants of others is the only whole|&s;ome regulator of our own expences, and carries with it a whole train of virtues, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;obriety and temperance. And tho&s;e who live
<PB N="68" REF="74">in the cu&s;tom of levying con&s;tant taxes on their vanities for &s;uch pur|po&s;es, &s;erve the poor &s;till le&s;s than they &s;erve them&s;elves, by cultivating &s;uch habits as make the be&s;t qualifi|cation for their final happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus when a vein of chri&s;tianity runs through the whole ma&s;s of a man's life, it gives a new value to all his actions, and a new character to all his views. It tran&s;mutes pru|dence and oeconomy into chri&s;tian virtues; and every offering that is pre&s;ented on the altar of charity becomes truly con&s;ecrated, when it
<PB N="69" REF="75">is the gift of obedience, and the price of &s;elf-denial. Piety is the fire from heaven, which can alone kindle the &s;acrifice, and make it ac|ceptable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when any act of bounty is performed by way of compo&s;ition with one's Maker, either as a purcha&s;e, or an expiation of un|allowed indulgences; though even in this ca&s;e, God (who makes all the pa&s;&s;ions of men &s;ub&s;ervient to his good purpo&s;es) can make the gift equally beneficial to the re|ceiver; yet it is &s;urely not too &s;evere
<PB N="70" REF="76">to &s;ay, that to the giver &s;uch acts are an unfounded dependance, a deceitful refuge, a broken &s;taff.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>LET not the truly &s;erious be offended, as if, in the pre&s;ent chapter, which is intended to treat of the notorious neglect of religious
<PB N="72" REF="78">education, I meant to confine the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity to merely me|chanical effects, and to &s;uppo&s;e that piety mu&s;t be the natural and inevi|table con&s;equence of early in&s;titu|tion. To imply this, would be in|deed to betray a lamentable igno|rance of human nature, of the di&s;|order &s;in has introduced, of the in|efficacy of human means, and en|tirely to mi&s;take the genius of our religion. It would be to &s;uppo&s;e that God was to depend upon <HI>our</HI> goodne&s;s, and not we upon <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be allowed that the
<PB N="73" REF="79">Supreme Being works chiefly by means; and though it is confe&s;&s;ed that no defect of education, no cor|ruption of manners can place any one out of the reach of the divine influences (for it is under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, perhaps, that the mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tances of divine grace have been manife&s;ted); yet it mu&s;t be owned that early &s;obriety, early knowledge of religion, and early habits of piety, are the mo&s;t probable means of &s;ecuring the fa|vour of God. To acquire the&s;e, is putting our&s;elves in the way in
<PB N="74" REF="80">which he him&s;elf has told us his ble&s;&s;ing is to be found.</P>
<P>But religion is the only thing in which we &s;eem to look for the end, without making u&s;e of the means: and yet it would not be more &s;ur|pri&s;ing if we were to expect that our children &s;hould become arti&s;ts and &s;cholars, without being bred to arts and languages, than it is to look for a chri&s;tian world without a chri&s;|tian education.</P>
<P>The noble&s;t objects can yield no delight, if there be not in the mind
<PB N="75" REF="81">a di&s;po&s;ition to enjoy them, ari&s;ing from an intelligence of their nature, and a reverence for their value, which can only &s;pring from long habit and early acquaintance. For to produce any capacity of enjoy|ment, there mu&s;t be a congruity between the mind and the object. To the mathematician demon&s;tration is plea&s;ure; to the philo&s;opher the &s;tudy of nature; to the voluptuous the gratification of his appetite; to the poet the plea&s;ures of the imagi|nation. The&s;e objects they all re|&s;pectively pur&s;ue as their proper bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as plea&s;ures adapted to that
<PB N="76" REF="82">part of their nature which they have been accu&s;tomed to indulge and cultivate.</P>
<P>Now, as men will be apt to act con&s;i&s;tently with their general views and habitual tendencies, would it not be ab&s;urd to expect that the philo&s;o|pher &s;hould look for his &s;overeign good at a ball, or the &s;en&s;uali&s;t in the plea&s;ures of intellect or piety? None of the&s;e ends are an&s;werable to the general views of the re&s;pective pur&s;uer; they are not corre&s;pon|dent to his ideas; they are not com|men&s;urate to his aims. The &s;ub|lime&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="83">plea&s;ures can afford little gra|tification where a previous ta&s;te has not been cultivated. A clown, who &s;hould hear a &s;cholar or an arti&s;t talk of the delights of a library, a picture gallery, or a concert, could not gue&s;s at the nature of the plea|&s;ures they afford; nor would his being introduced to them give him much clearer ideas, becau&s;e he would bring to them an eye blind to pro|portion, an under&s;tanding new to &s;cience, and an ear deaf to harmony.</P>
<P>Shall we expect then, &s;ince men can only be &s;cholars by &s;edulous labour,
<PB N="78" REF="84">that they &s;hall be chri&s;tians by mere chance? Shall we be &s;urpri&s;ed if tho&s;e do not fulfil the offices of reli|gion, who are not trained to an ac|quaintance with them? And will it not be obvious that it mu&s;t be &s;ome other thing be&s;ides the ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s of creeds and opinions which makes chri&s;tianity unfa&s;hionable?</P>
<P>For it will not probably be di&s;|puted, that in no age have the pa&s;|&s;ions of youth been &s;o early freed from the <HI>muzzle of re&s;traint;</HI> in no age has the paternal authority been &s;o contemptuou&s;ly treated, or every
<PB N="79" REF="85">&s;pecies of &s;ubordination &s;o di&s;dain|fully trampled on. All the &s;hades of di&s;crimination in &s;ociety &s;eem to be melting into each other. In no age has imprudent fondne&s;s been &s;o injuriou&s;ly lavi&s;h, or the &s;upernume|rary expences of the college and the &s;chool (that prolific &s;eed of corrup|tion) been &s;o prodigally augmented. In no age have the appetites been excited by &s;uch early &s;timulants, and anticipated by &s;uch premature in|dulgences. Never was the &s;hining glo&s;s, the charming novelty of life &s;o early worn off from all enjoyment by exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e. Never had &s;imple,
<PB N="80" REF="86">and natural, and youthful plea&s;ures &s;o early lo&s;t their power over the mind; nor was ever one great &s;ecret of virtue and happine&s;s, the &s;ecret of being cheaply plea&s;ed, &s;o little un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>A ta&s;te for co&s;tly, or artificial, or tumultuous plea&s;ures cannot be gra|tified, by their mo&s;t &s;edulous pur|&s;uers, at every moment; and what wretched management is it in the oeconomy of human happine&s;s &s;o to contrive, as that the enjoyment &s;hall be rare and difficult, and the inter|vals long and languid! Whereas
<PB N="81" REF="87">real and unadulterate plea&s;ures occur perpetually to him who cultivates a ta&s;te for truth and nature, and &s;cience and virtue. But the&s;e &s;imple and tranquil enjoyments cannot but be in&s;ipid to him, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have been prematurely excited by agitat|ing plea&s;ures, or who&s;e ta&s;te has been depraved by &s;uch as are deba&s;|ing and frivolous; for it is of more con&s;equence to virtue than &s;ome good people are willing to allow, to pre&s;erve the ta&s;te pure, and the judgment &s;ound. A vitiated intel|lect has no &s;mall connection with de|praved morals.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88">Since amu&s;ements of &s;ome kind are nece&s;&s;ary to all ages (I &s;peak now with an eye to mere human enjoy|ment), why &s;hould it not be as pro|per to tether man as other animals? Why &s;hould not he too be confined, in different &s;tages of life, to certain re&s;tricted limitations? &s;ince nothing but experience &s;eems to teach him, that, if he be allowed to anticipate his future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and trample all the flowery fields of real as well as tho&s;e of imaginary and artificial en|joyment, he not only induces pre&s;ent di&s;gu&s;t, but defaces and de&s;troys all the rich materials of his future hap|pine&s;s;
<PB N="83" REF="89">and leaves him&s;elf, for the re&s;t of his life, nothing but ravaged fields and barren &s;tubble.</P>
<P>But the great and radical defect, and that which comes more imme|diately within the pre&s;ent de&s;ign, &s;eems to be, that in general the characteri&s;tical principles of chri&s;ti|anity are not early and &s;trongly in|fu&s;ed into the mind: that religion is rather taught incidentally, as a thing of &s;ubordinate value, than as the leading principle of human actions, and the great animating &s;pring of human conduct. Were the high
<PB N="84" REF="90">influential principles of the chri&s;tian religion anxiou&s;ly and early incul|cated, we &s;hould find that tho&s;e lap&s;es from virtue, to which pa&s;&s;ion and temptation afterwards too fre|quently &s;olicit, would be more ea&s;ily recoverable.</P>
<P>For though the evil propen&s;ities of fallen nature, and the bewitching allurements of plea&s;ure, will too often &s;educe even tho&s;e of the be&s;t education into devious paths, yet we &s;hall find that men will &s;eldom be <HI>incurably</HI> wicked, without that in|ternal corruption of principle, which
<PB N="85" REF="91">knows how to ju&s;tify iniquity, and confirm evil conduct, by the &s;anction of corrupt rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The errors occa&s;ioned by the vio|lence of pa&s;&s;ion may be reformed, but &s;y&s;tematic wickedne&s;s will be only fortified by time; and no de|crea&s;e of &s;trength, no decay of ap|petite, can weaken the power of a pernicious principle. He who com|mits a wrong action indeed, puts him&s;elf out of the path of &s;afety; but he who adopts a fal&s;e principle, not only throws him&s;elf into the enemy's country, but burns the
<PB N="86" REF="92">&s;hips, breaks the bridge, cuts off every retreat by which he might hope one day to return into his own.</P>
<P>Surely it will &s;ubject no one to the imputation of bigotry or enthu&s;ia&s;m, if he venture to enquire whether the genuine doctrines of chri&s;tianity are made the &s;tandard by which our young men of fa&s;hion are commonly taught to try their principles, or to weight their actions; or whether &s;ome more popular &s;tandard, of cu&s;tom, or fa&s;hion, or worldly opinion, be not too frequently allowed to &s;uper&s;ede them? Whether &s;ome idol of fal&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="93">honour be not con&s;ecrated for them to wor&s;hip? Whether, even among the better &s;ort, reputation be not held out as a motive of &s;ufficient energy to produce virtue, in a world where yet the greate&s;t vices are every day practi&s;ed openly, which do not at all ob&s;truct the reception of tho&s;e who practi&s;e them into the be&s;t company? Whether re&s;entment be not enno|bled; and pride, and many other pa&s;&s;ions, erected into honourable vir|tues&mdash;virtues not le&s;s repugnant to the genius and &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, than obvious and gro&s;s vices? Will it be thought impertinent to enquire
<PB N="88" REF="94">if the awful doctrines of a perpetually pre&s;ent Deity, and a future righteous judgment, are early impre&s;&s;ed, and la&s;tingly engraven, on the hearts and con&s;ciences of our high-born youth?</P>
<P>Perhaps, if there be any one par|ticular in which we fall remarkably below the politer nations of anti|quity, it is in that part of education which has a reference to purity of mind, and the di&s;cipline of the heart.</P>
<P>For the great &s;ecret of religious education, and which &s;eems bani&s;hed
<PB N="89" REF="95">from the pre&s;ent practice, con&s;i&s;ts in training young men to an habitual interior re&s;traint, an early govern|ment of the affections, and a cour&s;e of &s;elf-controul over tho&s;e tyranniz|ing inclinations, which have &s;o natu|ral a tendency to en&s;lave the human heart. Without this habit of moral re&s;traint, which is one of the funda|mental laws of chri&s;tian virtue, though men may, from natural tem|per, often <HI>do</HI> good, yet it is perhaps impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould ever <HI>be</HI> good. Without the vigorous exer|ci&s;e of this controuling principle, the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, and the mo&s;t amia|ble
<PB N="90" REF="96">qualities, will go but a little way towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a virtuous cha|racter. For the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions will be ea&s;ily overcome by the con|currence of pa&s;&s;ion and temptation, in a heart where the pa&s;&s;ions have not been accu&s;tomed to this whole|&s;ome di&s;cipline: and the mo&s;t ami|able qualities will but more ea&s;ily betray their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, unle&s;s the yielding heart be fortified by re|peated acts, and long habits, of re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In this, as in various other in|&s;tances, we may blu&s;h at the &s;upe|riority
<PB N="91" REF="97">of Pagan in&s;titution. Were the Roman youth taught to imagine them&s;elves always in the awful pre|&s;ence of Cato, in order to habituate them betimes to &s;uppre&s;s ba&s;e &s;enti|ments, and to excite &s;uch as were generous and noble? And &s;hould not the chri&s;tian youth be continually reminded, that a greater than Cato is here? Should they not be trained to the habit of acting under the con|&s;tant impre&s;&s;ion, that <HI>He</HI> to whom they mu&s;t one day be accountable for intentions, as well as words and actions, is witne&s;s to the one as well as the other; that he
<PB N="92" REF="98">not only is "about their path," but "under&s;tands their very thoughts?"</P>
<P>Were the di&s;ciples of a Pagan <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pythagoras.</NOTE> leader taught that it was a motive &s;ufficient to compel their obedience to any rule, whether they liked it or not, that it had the authority of their teacher's name? were the bare words, <HI>the ma&s;ter hath &s;aid it,</HI> &s;uf|ficient to &s;ettle all di&s;putes, and to &s;ubdue all reluctance? And &s;hall the &s;cholars of a more divine teacher, who have a code of laws written by
<PB N="93" REF="99">God him&s;elf, be contented with a lower rule, or abide by a meaner authority? And is any argument drawn from human con&s;iderations likely to operate more forcibly on a dependent being, than that &s;imple but grand a&s;&s;ertion, with which &s;o many of the precepts of our reli|gion are introduced&mdash;Becau&s;e, THUS SAITH THE LORD?</P>
<P>For it is doing but little, in the infu&s;ion of fir&s;t principles, to obtain the bare a&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tanding to the exi&s;tence of one Supreme Power, unle&s;s the heart and affections
<PB N="94" REF="100">go along with the conviction, by our conceiving of that power as inti|mately connected with our&s;elves. A feeling temper will be but little affect|ed with the cold idea of a <HI>geometrical</HI> God, as the excellent Pa&s;cal expre&s;&s;es it, who merely adju&s;ts all the parts of matter, and keeps the elements in order. Such a mind will be but little moved, unle&s;s he be taught to con&s;ider his Maker under the inte|re&s;ting and endearing repre&s;entation which revealed religion gives of him. That "God is," will be to him rather an alarming than a con&s;olatory idea; till he be per&s;uaded of the &s;ub|&s;equent
<PB N="95" REF="101">propo&s;ition, that "he is the rewarder of all &s;uch as diligently &s;eek him." Nay, if natural religion does even acknowledge one awful attribute, that "God is ju&s;t;" it will only increa&s;e the terror of a tender con&s;cience, till he learn, from the fountain of truth, that he is "the ju&s;tifier of all who believe on him."</P>
<P>But if the great &s;anctions of our religion are not deeply engraven on the heart, where &s;hall we look for a more adequate curb to the fiery &s;pirit of youth? For, let the elements be ever &s;o kindly mixed in a human
<PB N="96" REF="102">compo&s;ition, let the natural temper be ever &s;o amiable, &s;till, whenever a man cea&s;es to think him&s;elf an ac|countable being, what motive can he have for re&s;i&s;ting a &s;trong temptation to a pre&s;ent good, when he has no dread that he &s;hall thereby forfeit a greater future good?</P>
<P>But it will be objected, that this deep &s;en&s;e of religion would interfere with the general purpo&s;es of educa|tion, which is de&s;igned to qualify men for the bu&s;ine&s;s of human life, and not to train up a race of monks and a&s;cetics.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="103">There is however &s;o little real &s;olidity in this &s;pecious objection, that I am firmly per&s;uaded, that if religious principles were more deep|ly impre&s;&s;ed on the heart, even the things of this world would be much better carried on. For where are we to look for &s;o much punctuality, diligence, application, doing every thing in its proper day (the great hinge on which bu&s;ine&s;s turns), as among men of principle? Oeco|nomy of time, truth in ob&s;erving his word, never daring to deceive or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o di&s;appoint&mdash;the&s;e are the very e&s;&s;ence of a man of bu&s;ine&s;s; and for the&s;e
<PB N="98" REF="104">to whom &s;hall we mo&s;t naturally look? Who is &s;o little likely to be "&s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s," as he who is "fervent in &s;pirit?" Will not he be mo&s;t regular in dealing with men, who is mo&s;t diligent in "&s;erving the Lord?"</P>
<P>But, it may be &s;aid, allowing that religion does not nece&s;&s;arily &s;poil a man of <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> yet it would ef|fectually defeat tho&s;e accompli&s;h|ments, and counteract that fine breed|ing, which e&s;&s;entially con&s;titute the <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="105">This again is &s;o far from being a natural con&s;equence, that, &s;uppo&s;ing all the other real advantages, of parts and education, to be equally taken into the account, there is no doubt but that, in point of true po|litene&s;s, a real chri&s;tian would beat the world at its own weapons, the world it&s;elf being judge.</P>
<P>For though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, other wickedne&s;s has made di&s;&s;imu|lation nece&s;&s;ary; and that being the ca&s;e, there is &s;carcely any one inven|tion for which we are more obliged
<PB N="100" REF="106">to mankind than for that of polite|ne&s;s, as there is perhaps no &s;creen in the world which hides &s;o many ugly &s;ights: yet while we allow that there never was &s;o admirable a &s;upplement to real goodne&s;s, as good breeding; it is however certain that the princi|ples of chri&s;tianity put into action, would nece&s;&s;arily produce more ge|nuine politene&s;s than any maxims drawn from motives of human vanity or convenience. If <HI>love, peace, joy, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, patience, good|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> may be thought in|&s;truments to produce &s;weetne&s;s of manners, the&s;e we are expre&s;sly told

Then would &s;imulation, and di&s;&s;imulation, and all the nice &s;hades
<PB N="102" REF="108">and delicate gradations of pa&s;&s;ive and active deceit, be rendered &s;uperflu|ous; and the affections of every heart be won by a &s;horter and a &s;urer way, than by the elegant obli|quities of this late popular preceptor; who&s;e mi&s;chiefs have outlived his reputation; and who, notwith&s;tand|ing the pre&s;ent ju&s;t declen&s;ion of his fame, has helped to relax the general nerve of virtue, and has left a taint upon the public morals, of which we are &s;till &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>That &s;elf-aba&s;ement then, which is in&s;eparable from chri&s;tianity, and
<PB N="103" REF="109">the external &s;igns of which good breeding knows &s;o well how to a&s;|&s;ume; and tho&s;e charities which &s;ug|ge&s;t invariable kindne&s;s to others, even in the &s;malle&s;t things, would, if left to their natural workings, produce that gentlene&s;s which it is one great object of a polite education to imi|tate.

<P>For however u&s;eful the in&s;titutions of poli&s;hed &s;ociety may be found,

<P>Among the many prejudices which the young and the gay entertain again&s;t religion, one is, that it is the declared enemy to wit and genius. But, &s;ays one of its wittie&s;t cham|pions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. South.</NOTE>, "Piety enjoins no man to be dull:" and it will be found, on a fair enquiry, that though it cannot be denied that irreligion has had able men for its advocates, yet they have never been the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> able. Nor can any learned profe&s;&s;ion, any depart|ment
<PB N="106" REF="112">in letters or in &s;cience, produce a champion on the &s;ide of unbelief, but chri&s;tianity has a &s;till greater name to oppo&s;e to it; philo&s;ophers them&s;elves being judges.</P>
<P>But while the young adopt an opinion, from one cla&s;s of writers, that religious men are weak; they acquire, from another, a notion that they are ridiculous: and this opi|nion, by mixing it&s;elf with their common notions, and deriving it|&s;elf from their very amu&s;ements, is the more mi&s;chievous as it is received without re&s;i&s;tance or &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="113">One common medium through which they take this fal&s;e view is, tho&s;e favourite works of with and humour, &s;o captivating to youthful imaginations, where no &s;mall part of the author's &s;ucce&s;s perhaps has been owing to his dexterou&s;ly introducing a pious character, with &s;o many vir|tues that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to love him, yet tinctured with &s;o many ab|&s;urdities that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to laugh at him. The reader's memory will furni&s;h him with too many in|&s;tances of what is here meant. The &s;lighte&s;t touches of a witty malice can make the be&s;t character ridicu|lous.
<PB N="108" REF="114">It is effected by any little aukwardne&s;s, ab&s;ence of mind, an ob&s;olete phra&s;e, a formal pronuncia|tion, a peculiarity of ge&s;ture.

<P><PB N="109" REF="115">But one of the mo&s;t infallible arts, by which the inexperienced are en|gaged on the &s;ide of irreligion, is that popular air of candour, good nature and toleration, which it &s;o in|variably puts on. While, on the one hand, &s;incere piety is often ac|cu&s;ed of moro&s;ene&s;s and &s;everity, becau&s;e it cannot hear the doctrines, on which it founds its eternal hopes, derided without emotion; indiffe|rence or unbelief, on the other hand, purcha&s;e the prai&s;e of candour at an ea&s;y price, becau&s;e they neither &s;uffer grief, nor expre&s;s indignation, at hearing the mo&s;t awful truths ri|diculed,

<P>The &s;coffers whom young people hear talk, and the books they hear quoted, fal&s;ely charge their own in|jurious opinions on chri&s;tianity, and then injuriou&s;ly accu&s;e her of being the mon&s;ter they have made. They dre&s;s her up, with the &s;word of per|&s;ecution in one hand, and the flames of intolerance in the other; and then ridicule the &s;ober-minded for wor|&s;hipping an idol which their mi&s;|repre&s;entation has rendered as ma|lignant as Moloch. In the mean
<PB N="111" REF="117">time they affect to &s;eize on benevo|lence with exclu&s;ive appropriation as their own cardinal virtue, and to ac|cu&s;e of a bigotted cruelty that nar|row &s;pirit which points out the perils of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and the ter|rors of a future account. And yet this benevolence, with all it stender mercies, is not afraid nor a&s;hamed to endeavour at &s;natching away from humble piety the comfort of a pre&s;ent hope, and the bright pro&s;pect of a felicity that &s;hall have no end. It does not however &s;eem a very pro|bable means of adding to the &s;tock of human happine&s;s, by plundering
<PB N="112" REF="118">mankind of that principle, by the de&s;truction of which friend&s;hip is robbed of its bond, &s;ociety of its &s;ecurity, patience of its motive. morality of its foundation, integrity of its reward, &s;orrow of its con&s;ola|tion, life of its balm, and death of its &s;upport.</P>
<P>It will not perhaps be one of the meane&s;t advantages of a better &s;tate, that as the will &s;hall be reformed, &s;o the judgment &s;hall be rectified; that "evil &s;hall no more be called good," nor the "churl liberal;" nor the plunderer of our be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, our
<PB N="113" REF="119">principles, benevolent. Then it will be evident that greater violence could not be done to truth and lan|guage, than to wre&s;t benevolence from chri&s;tianity, her mo&s;t appro|priate and peculiar attribute. If be|nevolence be "good will to men," it was that which angelic me&s;&s;engers were not thought too high to an|nounce, nor a much higher being than angels too great to teach by his precepts, and to illu&s;trate by his death: it was the criterion, the very watch-word as it were, by which he intended his religion and his follow|ers &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed. "By
<PB N="114" REF="120">this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye love one another." Be&s;ides, it is the very genius of chri&s;|tianity to extirpate all &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, on who&s;e vacated ground benevolence naturally and nece&s;&s;arily plants it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But not to run through all the particulars which ob&s;truct the growth of piety in young per&s;ons, I &s;hall only name one more. They hear much declamation from the fa&s;hion|able rea&s;oners again&s;t the contracted and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, that it

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Other &s;ymptoms of the decline of chri&s;tianity&mdash; No family religion&mdash;Corrupt or negligent example of &s;uperiors&mdash;The &s;elf-denying and evangelical virtues held in contempt&mdash;Neg|lect of encouraging and promoting religion among &s;ervants.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was by no means the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent undertaking to make a general invective on the corrupt &s;tate of manners, or even to animad|vert on the conduct of the higher ranks, but ina&s;much as the cor|ruption
<PB N="124" REF="130">of that conduct, and the depravation of tho&s;e manners, appear to be a natural con&s;equence of the vi&s;ible decline of religion.</P>
<P>Of the other obvious cau&s;es which contribute to this decline of morals little will be &s;aid. Nor is the pre|&s;ent a romantic attempt to re&s;tore the &s;implicity of primitive manners. This is too literally an age of gold, to expect that it &s;hould be &s;o in the poetical and figurative &s;en&s;e. It would be unju&s;t and ab&s;urd not to form our opinions and expectations from the pre&s;ent general &s;tate of &s;ociety. And it would argue great
<PB N="125" REF="131">ignorance of the corruption which commerce, and conque&s;t, and riches, and arts nece&s;&s;arily introduce into a &s;tate, to look for the &s;ame &s;ober-mindedne&s;s, &s;implicity, and purity among the <HI>dregs of Romulus,</HI> as the &s;evere and &s;imple manners of elder Rome pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>But though it would be an attempt of de&s;perate hardihood, to controvert that maxim of the witty bard, that
<Q>To mend the world's a va&s;t de&s;ign:</Q> Yet to make the be&s;t of the times in which we live; to fill up the
<PB N="126" REF="132">mea&s;ure of our own actual, particular, and individual duties; and to take care that the age &s;hall not be the wor&s;e for our having been ca&s;t into it, &s;eems to be the bare dictate of common probity, and not a romantic flight of impracticable perfection.</P>
<P>But is it then &s;o very chimerical to imagine that the benevolent can be &s;ober minded? Is it romantic to de&s;ire that the good &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent? Is it ab&s;urd to fancy that what has once been practi&s;ed &s;hould not now be impracticable?</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="133">It is impo&s;&s;ible then not to help regretting that it &s;hould be the gene|ral temper of many of the leading per&s;ons of that age which arrogates to it&s;elf the glorious character of the <HI>age of benevolence,</HI> to be kind, and con&s;iderate, and compa&s;&s;ionate, every where rather than at home: that the rich and the fa&s;hionable &s;hould be zealous in promoting religious, as well as charitable in&s;titutions abroad, and yet di&s;courage every thing which looks like religion in their own fami|lies: that they &s;hould be at a con|&s;iderable expence in in&s;tructing the poor at a di&s;tance, and yet di&s;credit
<PB N="128" REF="134">piety among their own &s;ervants&mdash; tho&s;e more immediate objects of every man's attention whom Providence has enabled to keep any, and for who&s;e conduct he will be finally accounta|ble, ina&s;much as he has helped to corrupt it?</P>
<P>Is there any degree of pecuniary bounty without doors which can counteract the mi&s;chief of a wrong example at home? or atone for that infectious laxity of principle, which &s;preads corruption wherever its influence extends? Is not he the be&s;t benefactor to &s;ociety who &s;ets
<PB N="129" REF="135">the be&s;t example, and who does, not only the mo&s;t good, but the lea&s;t evil? Will not that man, however liberal, very imperfectly promote virtue in the world at large, who neg|lects to di&s;&s;eminate the principles of it within the immediate &s;phere of his own per&s;onal influence, by a &s;ober conduct and a blamele&s;s behaviour? Can a generous but profligate per&s;on atone by his pur&s;e for the di&s;orders of his life, or expect a ble&s;&s;ing on his bounties, while he defeats their effect by a profane conver&s;a|tion?</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136">In moral as well as political treati&s;es, it is often a&s;&s;erted that it is a great evil to do no good: but it has not been perhaps enough in&s;i&s;ted on, that it is a great good to do no evil. This &s;pecies of goodne&s;s is not o&s;tenta|tious enough for popular declama|tion; and the value of this ab&s;tinence from vice is perhaps not well under|&s;tood but by chri&s;tians, becau&s;e it wants the o&s;ten&s;ible brilliancy of actual performance.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>principles</HI> of chri&s;tianity are in no great repute, &s;o their con|comitant <HI>qualities,</HI> the evangelical
<PB N="131" REF="137">virtues, are proportionably di&s;e&s;|teemed. But tho&s;e &s;ecret habits of &s;elf-controul, tho&s;e interior and un|obtru&s;ive virtues, which excite no a&s;toni&s;hment, kindle no emulation, and extort no prai&s;e, are yet the mo&s;t difficult, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime; and, if chri&s;tianity be true, will be the mo&s;t graciou&s;ly accepted by <HI>him</HI> who witne&s;&s;es the &s;ecret &s;truggle and the &s;ilent victory: while the &s;plendid deeds which have the world for their witne&s;s, and immortal fame for their reward, &s;hall perhaps co&s;t him who atchieved them le&s;s than it co&s;ts a con&s;cientious chri&s;tian to &s;ubdue
<PB N="132" REF="138">one irregular inclination; a conque&s;t which the world will never know, and if it did, would probably de|&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>For though great actions perform|ed on human motives are permitted, by the great Di&s;po&s;er, to be equally beneficial to &s;ociety with &s;uch as are performed on purer principles; yet it is an affecting con&s;ideration, that, at the final adju&s;tment of ac|counts, the politician who <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> a &s;tate, or the hero who <HI>pre&s;erved</HI> it, may mi&s;s of that favour of God, which, if it was not his motive, will
<PB N="133" REF="139">probably not be his reward. And it is awful to reflect, as we vi&s;it the monuments ju&s;tly rai&s;ed by public gratitude, or the &s;tatues properly erected by well-earned admiration, on what may now be the unalterable &s;tate of the illu&s;trious object of the&s;e de&s;erved honours; and that he who has &s;aved a &s;tate may have lo&s;t his own &s;oul.</P>
<P>A chri&s;tian life &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of two things, almo&s;t equally difficult; the adoption of good habits, and the exci&s;ion of &s;uch as are evil. No one
<PB N="134" REF="140">&s;ets out on a religious cour&s;e with a &s;tock of native innocence, or actual freedom from &s;in; for there is no &s;uch &s;tate in human life. The natu|ral heart is not a blank paper, where|on the divine &s;pirit has nothing to do but to &s;tamp characters of goodne&s;s; but many blots and defilements are to be era&s;ed, as well as fre&s;h impre&s;|&s;ions to be made.</P>
<P>The vigilant chri&s;tian therefore, who acts with an eye to the appro|bation of his Maker, rather than to that of makind; to a future ac|count, rather than to pre&s;ent glory;
<PB N="135" REF="141">will find, that, diligently to cultivate the "unweeded garden" of his own heart; to mend the &s;oil; to clear the ground of its indigenous vices, by practi&s;ing the painful bu&s;ine&s;s of ex|tirpation; will be that part of his duty which will co&s;t him mo&s;t labour, and bring him lea&s;t credit: while the fair flower of one &s;hewy action, produced with little trouble, and of which the plea&s;ure is reward enough, &s;hall gain him more prai&s;e than the eradication of the ranke&s;t weeds which overrun the natural heart.</P>
<P>But the Go&s;pel judges not after
<PB N="136" REF="142">the manner of men; for it never fails to make the ab&s;tinent virtues a previous &s;tep to the right perform|ance of the operative ones; and the relinqui&s;hing what is wrong to be a nece&s;&s;ary prelude to the perform|ance of what is right. It makes "cea&s;ing to do evil" the indi&s;pen|&s;able preliminary to "learning to do well." It continually &s;ugge&s;ts that &s;omething is to be laid a&s;ide as well as to be practi&s;ed. We mu&s;t "hate vain thoughts" before we can "love God's law." We mu&s;t lay a&s;ide "malice and hypocri&s;y," to <HI>enable</HI> us "to receive the engrafted word."</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="143">&mdash;Having "a con&s;cience void of offence;" "ab&s;taining from fle&s;hly lu&s;ts;" "bringing every thought into obedience"&mdash;the&s;e are actions, or rather negations, which, though they never will obtain immortality from the chi&s;el of the &s;tatuary, the declamation of the hi&s;torian, or the panegyric of the poet, &s;erve how|ever to con&s;titute the true chri&s;tian temper, to promote heavenly mind|edne&s;s, and to procure the divine favour.</P>
<P>And for our encouragement, it is ob&s;ervable that a more difficult chri&s;|tian
<PB N="138" REF="144">virtue generally involves an ea&s;ier one. An habit of &s;elf-denial in permitted plea&s;ures ea&s;ily induces a victory over &s;uch as are unlawful. And to &s;it loo&s;e to our own po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, nece&s;&s;arily includes an ex|emption from coveting tho&s;e of others; and &s;o on of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Will it be difficult then to trace back to that want of early re&s;traint noticed in the preceding chapter, that licence of behaviour which, having been indulged in youth, afterwards reigns uncontrouled in families; and having infected edu|cation
<PB N="139" REF="145">in its fir&s;t &s;prings, taints all the &s;treams of dome&s;tic virtue? Nor is it &s;trange that that &s;ame want of religious principle which corrupted our children, &s;hould corrupt our &s;ervants.</P>
<P>We &s;carcely go into any company without hearing &s;ome invective again&s;t the increa&s;ed profligacy of this order of men; and the remark is made with as great an air of a&s;|toni&s;hment, as if the cau&s;e of the complaint were not as vi&s;ible as the truth of it. It would be endle&s;s to point out in&s;tances in which the in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="140" REF="146">di&s;&s;ipation of their betters (as they are oddly called) has con|tributed to the growth of this evil. But it comes only within the imme|diate de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent under|taking, to in&s;i&s;t on the &s;ingle circum|&s;tance of the almo&s;t total extermi|nation of religion in fa&s;hionable families, as a cau&s;e, adequate of it&s;elf, to any con&s;equence which de|praved morals can produce.</P>
<P>Is there not a degree of inju&s;tice in per&s;ons who di&s;cover &s;trong in|dignation at tho&s;e crimes which crowd our pri&s;ons, and furni&s;h
<PB N="141" REF="147">our ince&s;&s;ant executions, and yet di&s;courage not an internal principle of vice; &s;ince tho&s;e crimes are no|thing more than that principle put into action? And it is no le&s;s ab&s;urd than cruel in &s;uch of the great as lead di&s;orderly lives, to expect to prevent vice by the laws they make to re&s;train or puni&s;h it, while their own example is a perpetual &s;ource of temptation to commit it. If by their own practice they demon&s;trate that they think a vicious life is the only happy one, with what colour of ju&s;tice can they inflict penalties on others, who, by acting on the &s;ame
<PB N="142" REF="148">principle, expect the &s;ame indul|gence?</P>
<P>And indeed it is &s;omewhat un|rea&s;onable to expect very high de|grees of virtue and probity from a cla&s;s of people who&s;e whole life, after they are admitted into di&s;&s;ipated families, is one continued counterac|tion of the principles in which they have probably been bred.</P>
<P>When a poor youth is tran&s;planted from one of tho&s;e excellent in&s;titu|tions which do honour to the pre&s;ent age, and give &s;ome hope of reform|ing
<PB N="143" REF="149">the next, into the family, perhaps, of his noble benefactor, who has provided liberally for his in&s;truc|tion; what mu&s;t be his a&s;toni&s;hment at finding the manner of life to which he is introduced diametrically oppo&s;ite to that life, to which he has been taught that &s;alvation is alone annexed! He has been trained in a whole&s;ome terror of gaming: but now his intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions are forcibly engaged on the &s;ide of play, &s;ince the very profits of his place are made <HI>&s;y&s;tematically</HI> to depend on the card-table. He has been taught that it was his bounden duty to be devoutly
<PB N="144" REF="150">thankful for his own &s;canty meal, perhaps of barley bread; yet he &s;ees his noble lord &s;it down every day,
<Q>Not to a dinner, but a hecatomb;</Q> To a repa&s;t for which every element is plundered, and every climate im|poveri&s;hed; for which nature is ran&s;acked, and art is exhau&s;ted; without even the formal ceremony of a &s;light acknowledgment. It will be lucky for the ma&s;ter, if his &s;ervant does not happen to know that even the pagans never &s;at down to a repa&s;t without making a libation to their deities; and that the Jews did not eat a little fruit, or drink a
<PB N="145" REF="151">cup of water, without an expre&s;&s;ion of devout thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Next to the law of God, he has been taught to reverence the law of the land; and to re&s;pect an act of parliament next to a text of Scrip|ture: yet he &s;ees his honourable protector, publicly in his own hou&s;e, engaged in the evening in playing at a game expre&s;sly prohibited by the laws, and again&s;t which perhaps he him&s;elf had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the day to pa&s;s an act.</P>
<P>While the contempt of religion
<PB N="146" REF="152">was confined to wits and philo&s;o|phers, the effect was not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt. But we cannot congratulate the ordinary race of mortals on their emancipation from old prejudices, or their indifference to &s;acred u&s;ages; as it is not at all vi&s;ible that the world is become happier in propor|tion as it is become more enlightened. We might rejoice more in the boa&s;ted diffu&s;ion of light and freedom, were it not apparent that bankruptcies are grown more frequent, robberies more common, divorces more numerous, and forgeries more exten&s;ive&mdash;that more rich men die by their own
<PB N="147" REF="153">hand, and more poor men by the hand of the executioner&mdash;than when chri&s;tianity was practi&s;ed by the vul|gar, and countenanced, at lea&s;t, by the great.</P>
<P>Is it not to be regretted therefore, while the affluent are encouraging &s;o many admirable &s;chemes for promot|ing religion among the children of the poor, that they do not like to <HI>perpetuate</HI> the principle, by encourag|ing it in their &s;ervants al&s;o? Is it not pity, &s;ince the&s;e are &s;o moderately furni&s;hed with the good things of this life, to rob them of that bright
<PB N="148" REF="154">rever&s;ion, the bare hope of which is a counterpoi&s;e to all the hard&s;hips they undergo here&mdash;e&s;pecially &s;ince, by dimini&s;hing this future hope, we &s;hall not be likely to add to their pre&s;ent u&s;efulne&s;s?</P>
<P>Still allowing, what has been already granted, that ab&s;olute infi|delity is not the reigning evil, and that &s;ervants will perhaps be more likely to &s;ee religion neglected than to hear it ridiculed; would it not be a meritorious kindne&s;s, in families of a better &s;tamp, to furni&s;h them with more opportunities of learning
<PB N="149" REF="155">and practi&s;ing their duty? Is it not impolitic indeed, as well as unkind, to refu&s;e them any means of having impre&s;&s;ed on their con&s;ciences the operative principles of chri&s;tianity? It is but little, barely not to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> their going to church, or doing their duty at home, unle&s;s their opportu|nities of doing both are facilitated, by giving them, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, as few employments as po&s;&s;ible that may interfere with both. Even when religion is by pretty general con&s;ent bani&s;hed from our families, that only furni&s;hes a &s;tronger rea|&s;on why our families &s;hould not
<PB N="150" REF="156">be bani&s;hed from religion in the churches.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e opportunities are not made ea&s;y and convenient to them, their &s;uperiors have no right to ex|pect from them a zeal &s;o far tran&s;|cending their own, as to induce them to &s;urmount difficulties for the &s;ake of their duty. Religion is never once repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as a light attainment; it is never once illu&s;trated by an ea&s;y, a quiet, or an indolent allegory. On the contrary, it is exhibited under the active figure of a combat, a race; &s;omething ex|pre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="151" REF="157">of exertion, activity, pro|gre&s;s. And yet many are unju&s;t enough to think that this warfare can be fought, though they are per|petually weakening the vigour of the combatant; this race be run, though they are ince&s;&s;antly ob&s;truct|ing the progre&s;s of him who runs by &s;ome hard and interfering com|mand. That that compa&s;&s;ionate judge who cannot but be particularly touched with the feeling of <HI>their</HI> infirmities, will tenderly allow for their trials, and be merciful to their failings, can never be doubted; but what portion of that forgivene&s;s he
<PB N="152" REF="158">will extend to tho&s;e who lay on their virtue hard burdens "too heavy for them to bear," who &s;hall &s;ay?</P>
<P>To keep any immortal being in a &s;tate of &s;piritual darkne&s;s, is a po&s;i|tive di&s;obedience to <HI>His</HI> law, who when he be&s;towed the Bible, no le&s;s than when he created the material world, &s;aid, <HI>Let there be light.</HI> It were well for both the advantage of ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, that the latter &s;hould have the doctrines of the Go&s;|pel frequently impre&s;&s;ed on his heart, that his con&s;cience &s;hould be made familiar with a &s;y&s;tem which offers
<PB N="153" REF="159">&s;uch clear and intelligible propo&s;i|tions of moral duty. The &s;triking interrogation, "how &s;hall I do this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?" will perhaps operate as forcibly on an uncultivated mind, as the mo&s;t eloquent e&s;&s;ay, to prove that man is not an accountable being. That once credited promi&s;e, that "they who have done well &s;hall go into everla&s;ting life," will be more grateful to the &s;pirit of a plain man, than that more elegant and di&s;inte|re&s;ted aphori&s;m, that <HI>virtue is its own reward.</HI> That "he that walketh uprightly walketh &s;urely," is not on
<PB N="154" REF="160">the whole a dangerous or a mi&s;lead|ing maxim. And "well done, good and faithful &s;ervant! I will make thee ruler over many things," though offen&s;ive to the liberal &s;pirit of phi|lo&s;ophic dignity, is a comfortable &s;upport to humble and &s;uffering piety. That "we &s;hould do to others as we would they &s;hould do to us," is a portable and compendi|ous mea&s;ure of &s;ocial duty, always at hand, as always referring to &s;ome|thing within him&s;elf, not ami&s;s for a poor man to carry con&s;tantly about with him, who has neither time nor learning to &s;earch for a better. All
<PB N="155" REF="161">Seneca's arguments again&s;t the fear of death, never yet reconciled one reader to its approach, half &s;o effec|tually as the humble believer is reconciled to it by that &s;imple per|&s;ua&s;ion, "I know that my Redeemer liveth."</P>
<P>While the modern philo&s;opher is extending the boundaries of human knowledge, by undertaking to prove that matter is eternal; or enlarging the &s;tock of human happine&s;s, by demon&s;trating the extinction of &s;pirit; it can do no harm to an un|lettered man to believe, that "heaven
<PB N="156" REF="162">and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, but God's word &s;hall not pa&s;s away." While the former is indulging the profitable enquiry why the Deity made the world &s;o late, or why he made it at all, it will not hurt the latter to believe that "in the beginning God made the world," and that in the end "he &s;hall judge it in righteou&s;ne&s;s." While the one is critici&s;ing the creed, he will be no lo&s;er by encouraging the other to keep the command|ments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The negligent conduct of chri&s;tians no real objection again&s;t chri&s;tianity.&mdash;The rea&s;on why its effects are not more manife&s;t to worldly men, is, becau&s;e believers do not lead chri&s;tian lives.&mdash;Profe&s;&s;ors differ but little in their practice from unbelievers.&mdash; Even real chri&s;tians are too diffident and timid, and afraid of acting up to their principles.&mdash;The ab&s;urdity of the charge commonly brought again&s;t &s;erious people, that they are too &s;trict.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is an objection frequently brought again&s;t chri&s;tianity, that if it exhibited &s;o perfect a &s;cheme,
<PB N="160" REF="166">if its influences were as &s;trong, if its effects were as powerful, as its friends pretend, it mu&s;t have pro|duced more vi&s;ible con&s;equences in the reformation of mankind. This is not the place fully to an&s;wer this ob|jection, which (like all the other cavils again&s;t our religion) continues to be urged ju&s;t as if it never <HI>had</HI> been an&s;wered.</P>
<P>That vice and immorality prevail in no &s;mall degree, in countries pro|fe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity, we need not go out of our own to be convinced. But that this is the ca&s;e only becau&s;e
<PB N="161" REF="167">this benign principle is not &s;uffered to operate in its full power, will be no le&s;s obvious to all who are &s;incere in their enquiries. For, if we allow (and who that examines impartially can help allowing?) that it is the na|tural tendency of chri&s;tianity to make men better, then it mu&s;t be the aver&s;ion to receiving it, and not the fault of the principle, which prevents them from becoming &s;o.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the effects it actually produced in the fir&s;t ages of the church, when it <HI>was</HI> received in its genuine purity,
<PB N="162" REF="168">and when it <HI>did</HI> operate, without ob|&s;truction, from its <HI>followers</HI> at lea&s;t, will want no other proof of its inhe|rent power and efficacy. At that period, its mo&s;t decided and indu&s;|trious enemy, the emperor Julian, could recommend the <HI>manners</HI> of the Galileans to the imitation of his pagan high prie&s;t; though he him|&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, was doing every thing which the mo&s;t invete|rate malice, &s;harpened by the acute&s;t wit, and backed by the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power, could devi&s;e, to di&s;credit their doctrines.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="169">Nor would the efficacy of chri&s;|tianity be le&s;s vi&s;ible now, in influ|encing the conduct of its profe&s;&s;ors, if its principles were heartily and &s;incerely received. They would operate on the conduct &s;o effectually, that we &s;hould &s;ee morals and man|ners growing out of principles, as &s;pontaneou&s;ly and nece&s;&s;arily as we &s;ee other con&s;equences grow out of their proper and natural cau&s;es. Let but this great &s;pring have its unob&s;tructed play, and there would be little occa&s;ion to declaim again&s;t this exce&s;s or that enormity. If the &s;ame &s;kill and care which are em|ployed
<PB N="164" REF="170">in curing &s;ymptoms, were vigorou&s;ly levelled at the internal principle of the di&s;ea&s;e, the moral health would feel the benefit. If that attention which is be&s;towed in lopping the redundant and un&s;ightly branches were devoted to the cultivation of a &s;ound and uncorrupt root, the ef|fect of this labour would &s;oon be di&s;covered by the excellence of the fruits.</P>
<P>For though even in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible exertion of religious princi|ple, and the mo&s;t diligent practice of all its con&s;equential train of virtues,
<PB N="165" REF="171">man would &s;till find evil propen&s;ities enough in his fallen nature, to make it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould counteract them, by keeping alive his diligence after higher attainments, and to quicken his a&s;pirations after a better &s;tate; yet the prevailing temper would be in general right, the will would be in a great mea&s;ure recti|fied; and the heart, feeling and ac|knowledging its di&s;ea&s;e, would ap|ply it&s;elf diligently to the only re|medy. For though even the be&s;t men have infirmities enough to de|plore, commit &s;ins enough to keep them deeply humble, and feel more
<PB N="166" REF="172">&s;en&s;ibly than others the imperfec|tions of that ve&s;&s;el in which their heavenly trea&s;ure is hid: the&s;e how|ever have the internal con&s;olation of knowing that they &s;hall have to reckon with one who "knoweth whereof they are made;" who will accept of faith and repentance in|&s;tead of &s;inle&s;s perfection, and of humble &s;incerity in lieu of intire holine&s;s.</P>
<P>All the heavy charges which have been brought again&s;t religion, have been taken from the abu&s;es of it. In every other in&s;tance the inju&s;tice
<PB N="167" REF="173">of this proceeding would be notori|ous: but there is a general want of candour in the judgment of men on this &s;ubject, which we do not find them exerci&s;e on other occa&s;ions; that of throwing the fault of the erring or ignorant profe&s;&s;or on the profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It does not derogate from the honourable profe&s;&s;ion of arms, that there are cowards and braggards. If any man lo&s;e his e&s;tate by the chi|canery of an attorney, or his health by the blunder of a phy&s;ician, it is commonly &s;aid that the one was a
<PB N="168" REF="174">di&s;grace to his bu&s;ine&s;s, and the other was ignorant of it; but no one there|fore concludes that law and phy&s;ic are contemptible profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity alone is obliged to bear all the obloquy incurred by the mi&s;conduct of its followers; to &s;u&s;|tain all the reproach excited by ignorant, by fanatical, by &s;uper&s;ti|tious, or hypocritical profe&s;&s;ors. But whoever accu&s;es it of a tendency to produce the errors of the&s;e profe&s;|&s;ors, mu&s;t have picked up his opi|nion any where rather than in the New Te&s;tament, which being the
<PB N="169" REF="175">only authentic hi&s;tory of chri&s;tianity, is that which candour would natu|rally con&s;ult for information.</P>
<P>But as worldly and irreligious men do not draw their notions from that pure fountain, but from the polluted &s;tream of human practice; as they form their judgment of divine truth, from the conduct of tho&s;e who pretend to be enlightened by it; &s;ome charitable allowance <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be made for the contempt which they entertain for chri&s;tianity, when they &s;ee what poor effects it produces in the lives of the gene|rality
<PB N="170" REF="176">of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians. What do they ob&s;erve there which can lead them to entertain very high ideas of the principles which give birth to &s;uch practices?</P>
<P>Do men of the world di&s;cover any marked, any decided difference be|tween the conduct of nominal chri&s;|tians, and that of the re&s;t of their neighbours, who pretend to no reli|gion at all? Do they &s;ee in the daily lives of &s;uch any great abundance of tho&s;e fruits by which they have heard believers are to be known? On the contrary, do they not di&s;cern
<PB N="171" REF="177">in them the &s;ame anxious and un|wearied pur&s;uit after the things of earth, as in tho&s;e who do not profe&s;s to have any thought of heaven? Do not they &s;ee them labour as &s;edu|lou&s;ly in the intere&s;ts of a deba&s;ing and frivolous di&s;&s;ipation, as tho&s;e who do not pretend to have any nobler object in view? Is there not the &s;ame eagerne&s;s to plunge into all &s;orts of follies them&s;elves, and the &s;ame unrighteous &s;peed in introduc|ing their children to them, as if they had never entered into a &s;olemn engagement to renounce them? Is there not the &s;ame &s;elf-indulgence,
<PB N="172" REF="178">the &s;ame luxury, and the fame pa&s;|&s;ionate attachment to the things of this world in them, as is vi&s;ible in tho&s;e who do not look for another?</P>
<P>Do not thoughtle&s;s neglect and habitual di&s;&s;ipation an&s;wer, as to &s;ociety, all the ends of the mo&s;t de|cided infidelity? Between the barely decent and the openly profane, there is indeed this difference; that the one, by making no profe&s;&s;ion, deceives neither the world nor his own heart; while the other, by intrenching him|&s;elf in forms, fancies that he does &s;omething, and thanks God that "he
<PB N="173" REF="179">is not like this publican." The one only &s;huts his eyes upon the danger which the other de&s;pi&s;es.</P>
<P>But the&s;e unfruitful profe&s;&s;ors would do well to recollect, that, by a conduct &s;o little worthy of their high calling, they not only violate the law to which they have vowed obe|dience, but occa&s;ion many to di&s;be|lieve or to de&s;pi&s;e it; that they are thus in a great mea&s;ure account|able for the infidelity of others, and of cour&s;e will have to an&s;wer for more than their own per&s;onal of|fences. For did they in any re&s;pect
<PB N="174" REF="180">live up to the principles they profe&s;s; did they adorn the doctrines of chri&s;|tianity by a life in any degree con&s;o|nant to their faith; did they exhibit any thing of the "beauty of holi|ne&s;s" in their daily conver&s;ation; they would then give &s;uch a demon|&s;trative proof, not only of the &s;ince|rity of their own obedience, but of the brightne&s;s of that divine light by which they profe&s;s to walk, that the mo&s;t determined unbeliever would at la&s;t begin to think there mu&s;t be <HI>&s;omething</HI> in a religion of which the effects were &s;o vi&s;ible and the fruits &s;o amiable; and might in time be
<PB N="175" REF="181">led to "glorify," not <HI>them,</HI> not the imperfect doers of the&s;e works, but, "their Father which is in heaven." Whereas, as things are at pre&s;ent carried on, the obvious conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be, either that chri&s;tians do not believe in the religion they profe&s;s, or that there is no truth in the reli|gion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>For will he not naturally &s;ay, that, if its influences were &s;o predominant, its con&s;equences mu&s;t be more evi|dent? that, if the prize held, out were really &s;o bright, tho&s;e who truly believed &s;o would &s;urely <HI>do</HI> &s;ome|thing,
<PB N="176" REF="182">and <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> &s;omething to ob|tain it?</P>
<P>This effect of the carele&s;s conduct of believers on the hearts of others, will probably be a heavy aggravation of their own guilt at the final rec|koning: and there is no negligent chri&s;tian can gue&s;s where the infec|tion of his example may &s;top; or how remotely it may be pleaded, as a palliation of the &s;ins of others, who either may think them&s;elves &s;afe while they are only doing what <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> allow them&s;elves to do; or who may adduce a chri&s;tian's habitual
<PB N="177" REF="183">violation of the divine law, as a pre|&s;umptive evidence that there is no truth in chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>This &s;wells the amount of the actual mi&s;chief beyond calculation. And there is &s;omething terrible in the idea of this &s;ort of indefinite evil, that the carele&s;s chri&s;tian can never know the extent of the con|tagion he &s;preads, nor the multi|plied infection which <HI>they</HI> may com|municate in <HI>their</HI> turn, whom <HI>his</HI> di&s;|orders fir&s;t corrupted.</P>
<P>And there is this farther aggrava|tion
<PB N="178" REF="184">of his offence, that he will not only be an&s;werable for all the po&s;i|tive evil of which his example is the cau&s;e; but for the omi&s;&s;ion of all the probable good which might have been called forth in others, had <HI>his</HI> actions been con&s;i&s;tent with his profe&s;&s;ion. What a &s;trong, what an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible conviction would it carry to the hearts of un|believers, if they beheld that charac|teri&s;tic difference in the manners of chri&s;tians, which their profe&s;&s;ion gives one a right to expect! if they &s;aw that di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, that humi|lity, &s;ober-mindedne&s;s, temperance,
<PB N="179" REF="185">&s;implicity, and &s;incerity, which are the unavoidable fruits of a genuine faith!</P>
<P>But, while a man talks like a &s;aint, and yet lives like a &s;inner; while he profe&s;&s;es to believe like an apo&s;tle, and yet leads the life of a &s;en&s;uali&s;t; talks of an ardent faith, and yet ex|hibits a cold and low practice; boa&s;ts him&s;elf the di&s;ciple of a meek ma&s;ter, and yet is as much a &s;lave to his pa&s;&s;ions as they who acknowledge no &s;uch authority; while he appears the proud profe&s;&s;or of an humble religion, or the intemperate champion
<PB N="180" REF="186">of a &s;elf-denying one: &s;uch a man brings chri&s;tianity into di&s;repute; confirms tho&s;e in error who might have been awakened to conviction; &s;trengthens doubt into di&s;belief, and hardens indifference into contempt.</P>
<P>Even among tho&s;e of a better ca&s;t, and a purer principle, the exce&s;&s;ive re&s;traints of timidity, caution, and that "fear of man, which bringeth a &s;nare," confine, and almo&s;t &s;tifle the generous &s;pirit of an ardent ex|ertion in the cau&s;e of religion. Chri&s;|tianity may pathetically expo&s;tulate, that it is not always "an open enemy
<PB N="181" REF="187">which di&s;honours her," but her "fa|miliar friend." And, "what do&s;t thou more than others?" is a que&s;tion which even the good and worthy &s;hould often a&s;k them&s;elves, in order to quicken their zeal; to prevent the total &s;tagnation of unexerted prin|ciples, on the one hand; or the dan|ger, on the other, of their being driven down the gulf of ruin, by the unre&s;i&s;ted and confluent tides of temptation, fa&s;hion, and example.</P>
<P>In a very &s;trict and mortified age, of which a &s;crupulous &s;everity was the predominant character, precau|tions
<PB N="182" REF="188">again&s;t an exce&s;&s;ive zeal might, and doubtle&s;s would, be a whole&s;ome and prudent mea&s;ure. But in the&s;e times of relaxed principle and frigid indifference, to &s;ee people &s;o vigi|lantly on their guard again&s;t the imaginary mi&s;chiefs of enthu&s;ia&s;m, while they run headlong into the real oppo&s;ite perils of a de&s;tructive licentiou&s;ne&s;s, puts one in mind of the one-eyed animal in the fable; who, living on the banks of the ocean, never fancied he could be de&s;troyed any way but by drowning: but, while he kept that one eye con&s;tantly fixed on the &s;ea, on which
<PB N="183" REF="189">&s;ide he concluded all the peril lay, he was devoured by an enemy on the dry land, from which quarter he never &s;u&s;pected any danger.</P>
<P>Are not the mi&s;chiefs of an enthu|&s;ia&s;tic piety in&s;i&s;ted on with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as if an extravagant de|votion were the prevailing propen|&s;ity? Is not the nece&s;&s;ity of modera|tion as vehemently urged as if an intemperate zeal were the epidemic di&s;temper of the great world? as if all our apparent danger and natural bias lay on the &s;ide of a too rigid au&s;terity, which required the di&s;creet
<PB N="184" REF="190">and con&s;tant counteraction of an oppo&s;ite principle? Would not a &s;tranger be almo&s;t tempted to ima|gine, from the frequent invectives again&s;t extreme &s;trictne&s;s, that ab|&s;traction from the world, and a mo|na&s;tic rage for retreat, were the ruling temper; that we were in &s;ome dan|ger of &s;eeing our places of diver&s;ion abandoned; and the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;cenes of the <HI>Holy Fathers of the de&s;ert</HI> acted over again by the frantic and uncontroulable devotion of our young per&s;ons of fa&s;hion?</P>
<P>It is &s;eriou&s;ly to be regretted,
<PB N="185" REF="191">in an age like the pre&s;ent, remarkable for indifference in religion and levity in manners, and which &s;tands &s;o much in need of lively patterns of firm and re&s;olute piety, that many who really are chri&s;tians on the &s;obere&s;t con|viction, &s;hould not appear more openly and decidedly on the &s;ide they have e&s;pou&s;ed; that they a&s;&s;imilate &s;o very much with the manners of tho&s;e about them (which manners they yet &s;cruple not to di&s;|approve); and, in&s;tead of an avow|ed but prudent &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought
<PB N="186" REF="192">preci&s;e and over-&s;crupulous; and ac|tually &s;eem to di&s;avow their right principles, by conce&s;&s;ions and ac|commodations not &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with them.

<P><PB N="188" REF="194">Few indeed of the more orderly and decent have any objection to that degree of religion which is compatible with their general ac|ceptance with others, or the full en|joyment of their own plea&s;ures. For a formal and ceremonious exerci&s;e of the outward duties of chri&s;tianity may not only be kept up without exciting cen&s;ure, but will even pro|cure a certain re&s;pect and confi|dence; and is not quite irreconcile|able with a voluptuous and di&s;&s;ipated life. So far many go; and &s;o far as "godline&s;s is profitable to the life that <HI>is,"</HI> it pa&s;&s;es without reproach.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="195">But as &s;oon as men begin to con|&s;ider religious exerci&s;es not as a de|cency, but a duty; not as a com|mutation for a &s;elf-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy temper, and a virtuous conduct: as &s;oon as they feel di&s;po&s;ed to carry the effect of their devotion into their daily life: as &s;oon as their principles di&s;cover them&s;elves, by leading them to with|draw from tho&s;e &s;cenes, and ab&s;tain|ing from tho&s;e actions, in which the gay place their &s;upreme happine&s;s: as &s;oon as &s;omething is to be <HI>done,</HI> and &s;omething is to be <HI>parted with;</HI> then the world begins to take offence,
<PB N="190" REF="196">and to &s;tigmatize the <HI>activity</HI> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it remained <HI>inoperative,</HI> and had only evaporated in <HI>words.</HI></P>
<P>But when religion, like the vital principle, takes its &s;eat in the heart, and &s;ends out &s;upplies of life and heat to every part; diffu&s;es motion, &s;oul, and vigour, through the whole circulation; and informs and ani|mates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the conver&s;ation, breaks out into a lively zeal for the honour of God, and the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind;
<PB N="191" REF="197">then the &s;incerity, or the under&s;tand|ing, of that per&s;on will become que&s;tionable: and it mu&s;t be owing to a very fortunate combination of circum&s;tances indeed, if he can at once pre&s;erve the character of parts and piety.</P>
<P>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too &s;trict, or too good. Where there happens to appear &s;ome foundation for the charge of enthu|&s;ia&s;m (as there are indeed too often in good people eccentricities which ju&s;tify the cen&s;ure), we may depend upon it, that it proceeds from &s;ome
<PB N="192" REF="198">defect in the judgment, and not from any exce&s;s in the piety; for in good|ne&s;s there is no exce&s;s: and it is as prepo&s;terous to &s;ay that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wi&s;e, too &s;trong, or too healthy; &s;ince the highe&s;t point in all the&s;e is only the perfection of that quality which we admired in a lower degree. There may be an <HI>imprudent,</HI> but there cannot be a <HI>&s;uperabundant</HI> goodne&s;s. An ardent imagination may mi&s;lead a rightly turned heart; and a weak in|tellect may incline the be&s;t intention|ed to a&s;cribe too much value to things of comparatively &s;mall importance.
<PB N="193" REF="199">And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when their "mint" and "ani&s;e" are rigorou&s;ly tithed.</P>
<P>But in ob&s;erving the "weightier matters of the law," in the practice of univer&s;al holine&s;s, in the love of God, there can be no po&s;&s;ibility of exceeding, while there is no limita|tion in the command. We are in no danger of loving our neighbour <HI>better</HI> than our&s;elves; and let us remem|ber, that we do not go beyond, but fall &s;hort of our duty, while we love him <HI>le&s;s.</HI> If we were commanded to
<PB N="194" REF="200">love God with <HI>&s;ome</HI> of our heart, with <HI>part</HI> of our &s;oul, and a <HI>portion</HI> of our &s;trength, there would then be &s;ome colour for tho&s;e perpetual cavils about the <HI>proportion</HI> of love, and the <HI>degree</HI> of obedience, which are due to him.

<P>The foundation of this &s;illy cen&s;ure is commonly laid in the fir&s;t princi|ples of education, where an early
<PB N="195" REF="201">&s;eparation is &s;y&s;tematically made between duty and plea&s;ure. One of the fir&s;t baits held out for the en|couragement of children, is, that when they have done their <HI>duty,</HI> they will be intitled to &s;ome <HI>plea&s;ure;</HI> thus forcibly disjoining what &s;hould be con&s;idered as in&s;eparable. And there is not a more common ju&s;tifi|cation of that idle and di&s;&s;ipated manner in which the &s;econd half of the Sunday is commonly &s;pent, even by tho&s;e who make a con&s;cience of &s;pending the former part properly, than that, "now they have done

<P>But while chri&s;tian ob&s;ervances are con&s;idered as ta&s;ks, which are to be got over to intitle us to &s;omething more plea&s;ant; as a burthen which we mu&s;t endure in order to propitiate an inexorable Judge, who makes a hard bargain with his creatures, and allows them ju&s;t &s;o much amu&s;ement in pay for &s;o much drudgery; we mu&s;t not wonder that &s;uch low views are entertained of chri&s;tianity, and that a religious life is reprobated as &s;trict and rigid.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="203">But to him who acts from the nobler motive of love, and the ani|mating power of the chri&s;tian hope, the exerci&s;e is the reward, the per|mi&s;&s;ion is the privilege, the work is the wages. <HI>He</HI> does not carve out &s;ome mi&s;erable plea&s;ure, and &s;tipulate for &s;ome meagre diver&s;ion, to pay him&s;elf for the hard performance of his duty, who in that very perform|ance experiences the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, and feels the true&s;t gratification of which his nature is capable.</P>
<P>This reprobated &s;trictne&s;s there|fore, &s;o far from being the &s;ource of
<PB N="198" REF="204">di&s;comfort and mi&s;ery, as is pre|tended, is in reality the true cau&s;e of actual enjoyment, by laying the axe to the root of all tho&s;e turbu|lent and unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions, the unre|&s;erved and yet imperfect gratifica|tion of which does &s;o much more tend to di&s;turb our happine&s;s than that &s;elf-government chri&s;tianity en|joins.</P>
<P>But all precepts &s;eem rigorous, all ob&s;ervances are really hard, where there is not an entire conviction of God's right to our obedience, and an internal principle of faith and
<PB N="199" REF="205">love to make that obedience plea&s;ant. A religious life is indeed a hard bondage to one immer&s;ed in the practices of the world, the fle&s;h, and the fa&s;hion. To a perfect chri&s;|tian, it is "perfect freedom." He does not now ab&s;tain from &s;uch and &s;uch things, merely becau&s;e they are forbidden (as he did in the fir&s;t &s;tages of his progre&s;s), but becau&s;e his &s;oul has no longer any plea&s;ure in them. And it would be the &s;evere&s;t of all puni&s;hments to oblige him to return to tho&s;e practices, from which he once ab&s;tained with
<PB N="200" REF="206">difficulty, and through the le&s;s noble principle of fear.</P>
<P>There is not therefore perhaps a greater mi&s;take than that common notion entertained by the more orderly part of the fa&s;hionable world, that a little religion will make people happy, but that an high degree of it is incompatible with all enjoyment. For &s;urely <HI>that</HI> religion can add little to a man's happine&s;s which re&s;trains him from the commi&s;&s;ion of a wrong action, but which does not pretend to extingui&s;h the bad principle from which the act proceeded. A reli|gion
<PB N="201" REF="207">which ties the hands, without changing the heart; which, like the hell of Tantalus, &s;ubdues not the de&s;ire, yet forbids the gratification, is indeed an uncomfortable &s;tate. Such a religion, though it may gain a man &s;omething on the &s;ide of re|putation, will give him but little inward comfort, if his heart be &s;till left a prey to that temper which produced the evil, even though ter|ror or &s;hame may have prevented the outward act.</P>
<P>That people devoted to the pur|&s;uits of a di&s;&s;ipated life &s;hould con|ceive of religion as a difficult and
<PB N="202" REF="208">even unattainable &s;tate, it is ea&s;y to believe. That they &s;hould conceive of it as an unhappy &s;tate, is the con&s;ummation of their error and their ignorance: for that a <HI>rational</HI> being &s;hould have his under&s;tanding en|lightened; that an <HI>immortal</HI> being &s;hould have his views extended and enlarged; that a <HI>helple&s;s</HI> being &s;hould have a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a <HI>&s;inful</HI> being the pro&s;pect of pardon; or a <HI>fallen</HI> one the a&s;&s;urance of re|&s;toration, does not &s;eem a probable ground of unhappine&s;s; and on any other &s;ubject &s;uch rea&s;oning would not be admi&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P><HI>A &s;tranger, from ob&s;erving the fa&s;hionable mode of life, would not take this to be a chri&s;tian country.&mdash;Lives of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;|tians examined by a compari&s;on with the Go&s;pel.&mdash;Chri&s;tianity not made the rule of life, even by tho&s;e who profe&s;s to receive it as an object of faith.&mdash;Temporizing divines contribute to lower the credit of chri&s;tianity. &mdash;Loo&s;e harangues on morals not calculated to reform the heart.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE chri&s;tian religion is not intended, as &s;ome of its fa&s;hion|able
<PB N="204" REF="210">profe&s;&s;ors &s;eem to fancy, to operate as a charm, a tali&s;man, or incantation; and to produce its effect by our pronouncing certain my&s;tical words, attending at certain con&s;e|crated places, and performing certain hallowed ceremonies: but it is an active, vital, in&s;luential principle, operating on the heart, re&s;training the de&s;ires, affecting the general conduct, and as much regulating our commerce with the world, our bu&s;ine&s;s, plea&s;ures, and enjoyments, our conver&s;ations, de&s;igns and ac|tions, as our behaviour in public wor&s;hip, or even in private devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="211">That the effects of &s;uch a principle are &s;trikingly vi&s;ible in the lives and manners of the generality of tho&s;e who give the law to fa&s;hion, will not perhaps be in&s;i&s;ted on. And indeed the whole pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of fa&s;hion|able life is utterly de&s;tructive of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. To in&s;tance only in one particular amu&s;ement, which is ge|nerally thought in&s;ignificant, and is in effect &s;o vapid, that one almo&s;t wonders how it can be dangerous: it would excite laugh|ter, becau&s;e we are &s;o broke into the habit, were I to in&s;i&s;t on the immorality of pa&s;&s;ing one's whole
<PB N="206" REF="212">life in a crowd. But tho&s;e promi&s;|cuous myriads which compo&s;e the &s;ociety, fal&s;ely &s;o called, of the gay world; who are brought together without e&s;teem, remain without plea|&s;ure, and part without regret; who live in a round of diver&s;ions, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which is &s;o joyle&s;s, though the ab&s;ence is &s;o in&s;upport|able; the&s;e, by the mere force of in|ce&s;&s;ant and indi&s;criminate a&s;&s;ociation, weaken, and in time wear out, the be&s;t feelings and affections of the human heart. And the mere &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation, thus contracted from invariable habit, even detached from
<PB N="207" REF="213">all its concomitant evils, is in it&s;elf as ho&s;tile to a religious &s;pirit, as more po&s;itive and actual offences. Far be it from me to &s;ay that it is as criminal; I only in&s;i&s;t that it is as oppo&s;ite to that heavenly minded|ne&s;s which is the e&s;&s;ence of the chri&s;tian temper.</P>
<P>We know that in the mingled ma&s;s which celebrate the orgies of di&s;&s;ipation, are many amiable and well-inclined hearts, whom nothing but the tyranny of fa&s;hion could have driven thither. But let us &s;up|po&s;e an ignorant and unprejudiced

<P>How would the petrified enquirer be a&s;toni&s;hed, if he were told that all the&s;e were of a religion meek, &s;piritual, &s;elf-denying; of which poverty of &s;pirit, a renewed mind, and non-conformity to the world, were &s;pecific di&s;tinctions!</P>
<P>When he &s;aw the &s;ons of men of
<PB N="211" REF="219">fortune, &s;carcely old enough to be &s;ent to &s;chool, admitted to be &s;pec|tators of the turbulent and unnatural diver&s;ions of racing and gaming; and the almo&s;t infant daughters, even of wi&s;e and virtuous mothers (an innovation which fa&s;hion her&s;elf for|bad till now), carried with mo&s;t un|thrifty anticipation to the frequent and late-protracted ball; would he believe that we were of a religion which has required from the&s;e very parents, a &s;olemn vow that the&s;e children &s;hould be bred up "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?"</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="220">When he beheld tho&s;e nocturnal clubs, &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of private virtue and dome&s;tic happine&s;s, would he conceive that we were of a religion which in expre&s;s terms "exhorts young men to be &s;ober-minded?"</P>
<P>When he &s;aw tho&s;e magnificent and brightly-illuminated &s;tructures which decorate and di&s;grace the very precincts of the royal re&s;idence (&s;o free it&s;elf from all the&s;e pollutions); when he beheld the nightly offerings made to the demon of play, on who&s;e cruel altar the fortune and happine&s;s of wives and children are offered up
<PB N="213" REF="221">without remor&s;e; would he not con|clude that we were of &s;ome of tho&s;e barbarous religions which enjoin un|natural &s;acrifices, and who&s;e horrid deities are appea&s;ed with nothing le&s;s than human victims? If any thing could add to his a&s;toni&s;hment, it mu&s;t be to ob&s;erve, in &s;ome more private temples of this demon, that the fair &s;acrifice is often a voluntary one, &s;elf-offered, and is at once both prie&s;te&s;s and victim.</P>
<P>Now ought we not to pardon our imaginary &s;pectator, if he &s;hould not at once conclude that all the
<PB N="214" REF="222">various de&s;criptions of per&s;ons, above noticed, profe&s;&s;ed the chri&s;tian reli|gion; &s;uppo&s;ing him to have no other way of determining but by the con|formity of their manners to that rule by which he had undertaken to judge them? We indeed our&s;elves mu&s;t judge with greater latitude, and can|didly take the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety into the account; which, in &s;ome few in&s;tances perhaps, mu&s;t be al|lowed to di&s;pen&s;e with that literal &s;trictne&s;s, which more peculiarly be|longed to the fir&s;t ages of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But as this is really a chri&s;tian
<PB N="215" REF="223">country, profe&s;&s;ing to enjoy the pure&s;t faith in the pure&s;t form; it cannot be unrea&s;onable to go a little farther, and enquire whether chri&s;tianity, however firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and gene|rally profe&s;&s;ed in it, is really prac|ti&s;ed by that order of fa&s;hionable per&s;ons, who, while they are ab&s;orbed in the delights of the world, and their whole &s;ouls devoted to the pur|&s;uit of plea&s;ure, yet &s;till arrogate to them&s;elves the honourable name of chri&s;tians, and occa&s;ionally te&s;tify their claim to this high character, by a general profe&s;&s;ion of their belief
<PB N="216" REF="224">in, and a decent compliance with, the forms of religion.</P>
<P>This enquiry mu&s;t be made, not by a compari&s;on with the &s;tate of chri&s;tianity in other countries (a mode always fallacious, whether adopted by nations or individuals, is that of comparing them&s;elves with tho&s;e who are &s;till wor&s;e); nor mu&s;t it be made from any notions drawn from cu&s;tom, decency, or any other human &s;tandard; but from a &s;cripture view of what real religion is; from any one of tho&s;e &s;triking and com|prehen&s;ive repre&s;entations of it,
<PB N="217" REF="225">which may be found conden&s;ed in &s;o many &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>Whoever then looks into the Book of God, and ob&s;erves its prevailing &s;pirit, and then looks into that part of the world under con&s;ideration, will not &s;urely be thought very cen&s;orious, if he pronounce that the conformity between them does not &s;eem to be <HI>very</HI> &s;triking; and that the one does not very evidently appear to be dictated by the other. Will he di&s;cover that the chri&s;tian religion is &s;o much as pretended to be made
<PB N="218" REF="226">the <HI>rule of life</HI> even by that decent order who profe&s;s not to have di&s;|carded it as an object of faith? Do even the more regular, who neglect not public ob&s;ervances, con&s;ider chri&s;tianity as <HI>the mea&s;ure of their ac|tions?</HI> Do even what the <HI>world</HI> calls religious per&s;ons employ their time, their abilities, and their fortune, as talents for which they however con|fe&s;s they believe them&s;elves account|able? Or do they in any re&s;pect live, I will not &s;ay up to their pro|fe&s;&s;ion (for what human being does &s;o?), but in any con&s;i&s;tency with it, or even with an eye to its predomi|nant
<PB N="219" REF="227">tendencies? Do per&s;ons in general of this de&s;cription &s;eem to con&s;ider the peculiar doctrines of the Go&s;pel as any thing more than a form of words, nece&s;&s;ary indeed to be repeated, and proper to be be|lieved? But do they con&s;ider them as nece&s;&s;ary to be adopted into a governing principle of action?</P>
<P>Is it con&s;i&s;tent to declare in the &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies that they are "mi&s;erable offenders," and that "there is no health in them," and never in their daily lives to di&s;cover any &s;ymptom of that humility which
<PB N="220" REF="228">&s;hould naturally be implied in &s;uch a declaration?</P>
<P>Is it rea&s;onable, or con&s;i&s;tent with good &s;en&s;e, earne&s;tly to lament hav|ing "followed the de&s;ires of their own hearts," and then deliberately to plunge into &s;uch a torrent of di&s;&s;i|pations as clearly indicates that they do not &s;truggle to re&s;i&s;t <HI>one</HI> of them? I dare not &s;ay this is hypocri&s;y, but &s;urely it is incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>"Be ye not conformed to this world," is a leading principle in the book they acknowledge as their
<PB N="221" REF="229">guide. But after unre&s;i&s;tingly a&s;&s;ent|ing to this, as a doctrinal truth, at church; how ab&s;urd would they think any one who &s;hould expect them to adopt it into their practice! Perhaps the whole law of God does not exhibit a &s;ingle precept more expre&s;sly, more &s;teadily, and more uniformly rejected. If it mean any thing, it can hardly be con&s;i&s;tent with that mode of life emphatically di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>fa&s;hionable.</HI></P>
<P>Now would it be much more ab|&s;urd (for any other rea&s;on but becau&s;e
<PB N="222" REF="230">it is not the cu&s;tom) if our legi&s;|lators were to meet one day in every week, gravely to read over all the ob&s;olete &s;tatutes, and re&s;cinded acts of parliament; than it is for the order of per&s;ons of the above de|&s;cription to a&s;&s;emble every Sunday, to profe&s;s their belief in, and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to, a &s;y&s;tem of principles, which they do not &s;o much as <HI>intend</HI> &s;hall be binding on their practice?</P>
<P>But to continue our enquiry.&mdash; There is not a more common or more intelligible definition of human duty, than that of "Fear God, and
<PB N="223" REF="231">keep his commandments." Now, as to the fir&s;t of the&s;e in&s;eparable pre|cepts, can we, with the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of charity, be very forward to con|clude that God is really "very greatly feared," in &s;ecret, by tho&s;e who give too manife&s;t indications that they live "without him in the world." And as to the latter pre|cept, which naturally grows out of the other&mdash;without noticing any of the flagrant breaches of the moral law, let us only confine our&s;elves to the allowed, general, and notorious violation of the fourth command|ment, and then enquire what apology
<PB N="224" REF="232">can be offered for this, by believers at lea&s;t, who &s;cruple not to allow the authority of that book, which de|clares, among many other alarming denunciations, that the wilful and habitual offender in any one point is guilty of the breach of the whole law.</P>
<P>Shall we have rea&s;on to change our opinion, if we take another divine repre&s;entation of the &s;um and &s;ub|&s;tance of religion, and apply it as a touch&s;tone in the pre&s;ent trial&mdash; "Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and
<PB N="225" REF="233">thy neighbour as thy&s;elf?" Now, judging by inference, do we &s;ee many public proofs of that heavenly-mind|edne&s;s which would be the inevitable effect of &s;uch a fervent and animated dedication of all the powers, faculties, and affections of the &s;oul to him who gave it? And, as to the great rule of &s;ocial duty expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd clau&s;e, do we ob&s;erve very much of that con&s;iderate kindne&s;s, that pure di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, that con&s;cien|tious attention to the comfort of others, e&s;pecially of dependants and inferiors, which might be expected from tho&s;e who enjoy the privilege
<PB N="226" REF="234">of &s;o unerring a &s;tandard of con|duct? a &s;tandard which, if imparti|ally con&s;ulted, mu&s;t make our kind|ne&s;s to others bear an exact propor|tion to our &s;elf-love: a rule in which chri&s;tian principle, operating on hu|man &s;en&s;ibility, could not fail to de|cide aright in every &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;e. For no man can doubt how he ought to act towards another, while the corre&s;ponding &s;ugge&s;tions of con|&s;cience and feeling concur in letting him know how he would wi&s;h, in a change of circum&s;tances, that others &s;hould act towards him.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="235">Or &s;uppo&s;e we take a more de|tailed &s;urvey, by a third rule, which indeed is not &s;o much the principle as the effect of piety&mdash;"True reli|gion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to vi&s;it the father|le&s;s and widows in their affliction, and to keep him&s;elf <HI>un&s;potted from the world."</HI> Now if chri&s;tianity in&s;i&s;ts that obedience to the latter injunc|tion be the true evidence of the &s;incerity of tho&s;e who fulfil the former, is the beneficence of the fa&s;hionable world <HI>very</HI> &s;trikingly illu&s;trated by this &s;potle&s;s purity, this exemption from the pollutions of the world,
<PB N="228" REF="236">which is declared to be its in|fallible &s;ymptom?</P>
<P>But if I were to venture to take my e&s;timate with a view more immedi|ately evangelical; if I pre&s;umed to look for that genuine chri&s;tianity which con&s;i&s;ts in "repentance to|wards God, and faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" to in&s;i&s;t that, whatever <HI>natural</HI> religion and <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> reli|gion may teach, it is the peculiarity of the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> religion to humble the &s;in|ner, and exalt the Saviour; to in&s;i&s;t that not only the gro&s;sly flagitious, but that <HI>all,</HI> have &s;inned; that <HI>all</HI> are by nature in a &s;tate of condemna|tion;
<PB N="229" REF="237">that <HI>all</HI> &s;tand in need of mercy, of which there is no hope but on the Go&s;pel terms; that eternal life is promi&s;ed to tho&s;e <HI>only</HI> who accept it on the offered conditions of "faith, repentance, and renewed obedience;" &mdash;if I were to in&s;i&s;t on &s;uch evidences of our chri&s;tianity as the&s;e; if I were to expre&s;s the&s;e doctrines in plain &s;criptural terms, without lowering, qualifying, di&s;gui&s;ing, or doing them away; if I were to in&s;i&s;t on this belief, and its implied and corre|&s;ponding practices; I am aware that, with whatever conde&s;cending patience this little tract might have been &s;o
<PB N="230" REF="238">far peru&s;ed, many a fa&s;hionable reader would here throw it a&s;ide, as having now detected the palpable enthu&s;ia&s;t, the abettor of "&s;trange doctrines," long ago con&s;igned over by the liberal and the polite to bigots and fanatics. And yet, if the Bible be true, this is a &s;imple and faithful de&s;cription of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>After having, however, ju&s;t ven|tured to hint that &s;uch are indeed the humbling doctrines of the Go&s;pel, to which alone eternal life is promi&s;ed; I &s;hall, in deep humility, forbear enlarging on this part of the &s;ubject,
<PB N="231" REF="239">which has been exhau&s;ted by the labours of wi&s;e and pious men in all ages. Unhappily, however, the mo&s;t awakening of the&s;e writers are not the favourite gue&s;ts in the clo&s;ets of the more fa&s;hionable chri&s;tians; who, when they happen to be more &s;e|riou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed than ordinary, are fond of finding out &s;ome middle kind of reading, which recommends &s;ome half-way &s;tate, &s;omething be|tween pagani&s;m and chri&s;tianity, &s;u&s;pending the mind, like the po&s;ition of Mahomet's tomb, between earth and heaven: a kind of reading which, while it quiets the con&s;cience
<PB N="232" REF="240">by being on the &s;ide of morals, nei|ther awakens their fears, nor alarms their &s;ecurity. By dealing in gene|rals, it comes home to the hearts of none: it flatters the pa&s;&s;ions of the reader, by a&s;cribing high merit to the performance of certain right ac|tions, and the forbearance from cer|tain wrong ones; among which, that reader mu&s;t be very unlucky indeed who does not find &s;ome performances and &s;ome forbearances of his own. It at once enables him to keep heaven in his eye, and the world in his heart. It agreeably repre&s;ents the readers to them&s;elves as amiable
<PB N="233" REF="241">per&s;ons; guilty indeed of a few faults, but never as condemned &s;inners under &s;entence of death.

<PB N="235" REF="243">as the only certain &s;ource of man|ners; who lay the axe to the root, oftener than the pruning knife to the branch; who in&s;i&s;t much and often on the great leading truths, that man is a fallen creature, who mu&s;t be re&s;tored, if he be re&s;tored at all, by means very little flattering to human pride&mdash;&s;uch as the&s;e will &s;eldom find acce&s;s to the hou&s;es and hearts of the more modi&s;h chri&s;tians; un|le&s;s they happen to owe their ad|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome &s;ubordinate quality of &s;tyle; unle&s;s they can captivate, with the &s;educing graces of language, tho&s;e well-bred readers, who are

<P>Whatever comparative prai&s;e may be due to the former cla&s;s of writers, when viewed with others of a le&s;s decent order, yet I am not &s;ure whether &s;o many books of frigid morality, exhibiting &s;uch inferior motives of action, and &s;uch mode|rate
<PB N="237" REF="245">repre&s;entations of duty, have not done religion much more harm than good; whether they do not lead many a reader to enquire what is the lowe&s;t degree in the &s;cale of virtue with which he may content him&s;elf, &s;o as barely to e&s;cape eternal puni&s;h|ment; how much indulgence he may allow him&s;elf, without ab&s;olutely forfeiting his chance of &s;afety; what is the uttermo&s;t verge to which he may venture of this world's enjoy|ment, and yet ju&s;t keep within a po&s;&s;ibility of hope for the next: adju&s;ting the &s;cales of indulgence and &s;ecurity with &s;uch a &s;crupulous
<PB N="238" REF="246">equilibrium, as not to lo&s;e much plea&s;ure, yet not incur much penalty.</P>
<P>This is hardly an exaggerated repre&s;entation: and to the&s;e low views of duty is partly owing &s;o much of that bare-weight virtue with which even chri&s;tians are &s;o apt to content them&s;elves: fighting for every inch of ground which may po&s;&s;ibly be taken within the pales of permi&s;&s;ion; and &s;tretching tho&s;e pales to the utmo&s;t edge of that limitation about which the World and the Bible con|tend.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="247">But while the nominal chri&s;tian is per&s;uading him&s;elf that there can be no harm in going <HI>a little farther,</HI> the real chri&s;tian is always afraid of going too far. While the one is debating for a little more di&s;puted ground, the other is &s;o fearful of &s;traying into the regions of unal|lowed indulgence, that he keeps at a prudent di&s;tance from the extremity of his permitted limits, and is as anxious in re&s;tricting as the other is in extending them. One thing is clear, and it may be no bad indica|tion by which to di&s;cover the &s;tate of a man's heart to him&s;elf: while he is
<PB N="240" REF="248">contending for this allowance, and &s;tipulating for the other indulgence, it will &s;hew him that, whatever change there may be in his life, there is none in his heart; the temper remains as it did; and it is by the inward frame rather than the outward act that he can be&s;t judge of his <HI>own</HI> &s;tate, whatever may be the rule by which he undertakes to judge of that of another.</P>
<P>It is le&s;s wonderful that there are not more chri&s;tians, than that chri&s;|tians, as they are called, are not better men: for, it chri&s;tianity be not true,
<PB N="241" REF="249">the motives to virtue are not high enough to quicken ordinary men to very extraordinary exertions. We &s;ee them do and &s;uffer every day, for popularity, for cu&s;tom, for fa&s;hion, for the point of honour, not only more than good men do and &s;uffer for religion, but a great deal more than religion requires them to do for her <HI>rea&s;onable &s;ervice</HI> demands no &s;acrifices but what are &s;anctioned by good &s;en&s;e, &s;ound policy, right rea&s;or, and uncorrupt judgment.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e fa&s;hionable profe&s;|&s;ors even go &s;o far as to bring their
<PB N="242" REF="250">right faith as an apology for their wrong practice. They have a com modious way of intrenching ther &s;elves within the &s;helter of &s;o general po&s;ition of unque&s;tionable truth. Even the great chri&s;tian hope becomes a &s;nare to them. They apologize for a life of offence, by taking refuge in the &s;upreme good|nets they are abu&s;ing. That "God is all merciful," is the common re|ply to tho&s;e who hint to them their danger. This is a fal&s;e and fatal application of a divine and comfort|able truth. Nothing can be more certain than the propo&s;ition, nor
<PB N="243" REF="251">more delu&s;ive than the inference: for their deduction implies, not that he is merciful to &s;in repented of, but to &s;in continued in. But it is a mo&s;t fallacious hope to expect that God will violate his own covenant, or that he is indeed "all mercy," to the utter exclu&s;ion of his other attributes of perfect holine&s;s, purity, and ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>It is a dangerous folly to re&s;t on the&s;e vague and general notions of uncovenanted mercy; and nothing can be more delu&s;ive than this in|definite tru&s;t in being forgiven in
<PB N="244" REF="252">our <HI>own</HI> way, after God has clearly revealed to us that he will only for|give us in <HI>his</HI> way.</P>
<P>But the truth is, no one does truly tru&s;t in God, who does not endeavour to obey him. For to break his laws, and yet to depend on his favour; to live in oppo&s;ition to his will, and yet in expectation of his mercy; to vio|late his commands and yet look for his acceptance, would not, in any other in&s;tance, be thought a rea&s;on|able ground of conduct; and yet it is by no means as uncommon as it is incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="253">But the life of a di&s;&s;ipated chri&s;tian &s;eems to be a perpetual &s;truggle to reconcile impo&s;&s;ibilities; it is an en|deavour to unite what God has for ever &s;eparated, peace and &s;in; un|chri&s;tian practices with chri&s;tian ob|&s;ervances; a quiet con&s;cience and a di&s;orderly life; a heart full of this world and an unfounded dependance on the happine&s;s of the next.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>View of tho&s;e who acknowledge chri&s;tianity as a perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, but deny its di|vine authority.&mdash;Morality not the whole of religion.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS in the preceding chapter notice was taken of that de|&s;cription of per&s;ons who profe&s;s to receive chri&s;tianity with great reve|rence as a matter of faith, who yet do not pretend to adopt it as a rule of
<PB N="247" REF="255">conduct; I &s;hall conclude the&s;e &s;light remarks with &s;ome &s;hort ani|madver&s;ions on another &s;et of men, and that not a &s;mall one, among the decent and the fa&s;hionable, who pro|fe&s;s to think it exhibits an admirable &s;y&s;tem of morals, while they deny its divine authority; though that alone can make the nece&s;&s;ity of obey|ing its precepts binding on the con|&s;ciences of men.</P>
<P>This is a very di&s;creet &s;cheme: for &s;uch per&s;ons at once &s;ave them|&s;elves from the di&s;credit of having their under&s;tanding impo&s;ed upon
<PB N="248" REF="256">by a &s;uppo&s;ed blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to evidences and authorities; and yet, prudently enough, &s;ecure to them|&s;elves, in no &s;mall degree, the repu|tation of good men. By &s;teering this middle kind of cour&s;e, they con|trive to be reckoned liberal by the <HI>philo&s;ophers,</HI> and decent by the be|lievers.</P>
<P>But we are not commonly to ex|pect to &s;ee the pure morality of the Go&s;pel very carefully transfu&s;ed into the lives of &s;uch objectors. And indeed it would be unju&s;t to imagine that the precepts <HI>&s;hould</HI> be mo&s;t
<PB N="249" REF="257">&s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who reject the authority. The influence of divine truth mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be&s;t prepare the heart for an unre&s;erved obedience to its laws. If we do not depend on that pardon and accept|ance which chri&s;tianity offers, we &s;hall want the be&s;t motive to the actions and performances which it enjoins. A lively belief <HI>mu&s;t</HI> there|fore precede a very hearty and com|plete obedience. We are told, on the very be&s;t authority, that truth &s;anc|tifies the heart: and the &s;ame au|thority adds, that the "word of God is truth." That command therefore,
<PB N="250" REF="258">for in&s;tance, to &s;et "our affections on things above," will operate but faintly, till that &s;pirit from which the command proceeds touches the heart, and convinces it that no human good is worthy of the entire affection of an immortal creature. An un|re&s;erved faith in the promi&s;er mu&s;t precede our worthy performance of any duty to which the promi&s;e is annexed.</P>
<P>But as to a &s;et of duties, enforced by no other motive than a bare acqui|e&s;cence in their beauty, and a cold conviction of their propriety; but
<PB N="251" REF="259">impelled by no obedience to his au|thority who impo&s;es them; though we know not how well they might be performed by pure and impeccable beings, yet we know how they com|monly <HI>are</HI> performed by frail and di&s;orderly creatures, fallen from their innocence, and corrupt in their very natures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, nothing but a conviction of the truth of chri&s;tianity can recon|cile thinking beings to the extraordi|nary appearances of things in the Creator's moral government of the world. The works of God are an
<PB N="252" REF="260">enigma, of which his word alone is the &s;olution. The dark veil which is thrown over the divine di&s;pen&s;a|tions in this lower world, mu&s;t natu|rally &s;hock tho&s;e who con&s;ider only the &s;ingle &s;cene which is acting on the pre&s;ent &s;tage; but is reconcile|able to him who, having learnt from revelation the nature of the laws by which the great Author acts, tru&s;ts confidently that the cata&s;trophe will &s;et all to rights. The confu&s;ion which &s;in and the pa&s;&s;ions have introduced; the triumph of wickedne&s;s; the &s;eemingly arbitrary di&s;proportion of human conditions, accountable on
<PB N="253" REF="261">no &s;cheme but that which the Go&s;pel has opened to us&mdash;have all a natural tendency to withdraw from the love of God the hearts of tho&s;e who erect them&s;elves into critics on the divine conduct, and yet will not &s;tudy the plan, and get acquainted with the rules, &s;o far as it has plea&s;ed the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er to re|veal them.</P>
<P>Till therefore the word of God is u&s;ed as "a lamp to their paths," men can neither truly di&s;cern the crookedne&s;s of their own ways, nor the perfection of that light by which
<PB N="254" REF="262">they are directed to walk. And this light can only be &s;een by its own pro|per brightne&s;s; it has no other me|dium. Till therefore "the &s;ecret of the Lord" is with men, they will not truly "fear him;" till he has "en|larged their hearts" with the know|ledge and belief of his word, they will not very vigorou&s;ly "run the way of his commandments." Till they have acquired that "faith without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God," they will not attain that holine&s;s with|out which no man can &s;ee him.</P>
<P>And indeed if God has thought
<PB N="255" REF="263">fit to make the go&s;pel an in&s;trument of &s;alvation, we mu&s;t own the nece&s;|&s;ity of receiving it as a divine in&s;ti|tution, before it is likely to operate very effectually on the conduct. The great Creator, if we may judge by analogy from natural things, is &s;o wi&s;e an oeconomi&s;t, that he always adapts, with the mo&s;t accurate pre|ci&s;ion, the in&s;trument to the work; and never lavi&s;hes more means than are nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h the pro|po&s;ed end. If therefore chri&s;tianity had been intended for nothing more than a mere &s;y&s;tem of ethics, &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem &s;urely might have been pro|duced
<PB N="256" REF="264">at an infinitely le&s;s expence. The long chain of prophecy, the labours of apo&s;tles, the blood of &s;aints, to &s;ay nothing of the great and co&s;tly &s;acrifice which the go&s;pel records, might &s;urely have been &s;pared. Le&s;&s;ons of mere human virtue might have been delivered by &s;ome &s;uitable in&s;trument of human wi&s;dom, &s;trengthened by the vi&s;ible authority of human power. A bare &s;y&s;tem of morals might have been communicated to mankind with a more rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of advan|tage, by means not &s;o repugnant to human pride. A mere &s;cheme of
<PB N="257" REF="265">conduct might have been delivered, with far greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s, by Anto ninus the emperor, or Plato the philo&s;opher, than by Paul the tent-maker, or Peter the fi&s;herman.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, then, mu&s;t be em|braced entirely, if it be received at all. It mu&s;t be taken, without mu|tilation, as a perfect &s;cheme, in the way in which God has been plea&s;ed to reveal it. It mu&s;t be accepted, not as exhibiting beautiful parts, but as pre&s;enting one con&s;ummate whole, of which the perfection ari&s;es from coherence and dependence,
<PB N="258" REF="266">from relation and con&s;i&s;tency. Its power will be weakened, and its energy de&s;troyed, if every caviller pulls out a pin, or ob&s;tructs a &s;pring, with the pre&s;umptuous view of new|modelling the divine work, and making it go to his own mind. There is no breaking this &s;y&s;tem into portions of which we are at liberty to choo&s;e one, and reject another. There is no &s;eparating the evidences from the doctrines, the doctrines from the precepts, belief from obedience, morality from piety, the love of our neighbour from the love of God. If we pro|fe&s;s
<PB N="259" REF="267">chri&s;tianity at all, if we allow the Divine Author to be indeed unto us "wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s," he mu&s;t be al&s;o "&s;anctification and re|demption."</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, then, is a&s;&s;uredly &s;ome|thing more than a mere &s;et of rules; and piety, though it never pretended to be the &s;ub&s;titute for a good life, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to its ac|ceptance with God. The Go&s;pel never offers to make religion &s;uper|&s;ede morality, but every where clearly proves that morality is not the whole of religion. Piety is not
<PB N="260" REF="268">only nece&s;&s;ary as a <HI>means,</HI> but is it|&s;elf a mo&s;t important <HI>end.</HI> It is not only the be&s;t principle of moral conduct, but is an indi&s;pen&s;able and ab&s;olute duty in it&s;elf. It is not only the highe&s;t motive to the prac|tice of virtue, but is a prior obliga|tion; and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, even when detached from its immediate influence on practical goodne&s;s. Religion will &s;urvive all the virtues of which it is the &s;ource; for we &s;hall be living in the noble&s;t exer|ci&s;es of piety, when we &s;hall have no objects on which to exerci&s;e many human virtues. When there
<PB N="261" REF="269">will be no di&s;tre&s;s to be relieved, no injuries to be forgiven, no evil habits to be &s;ubdued; there will be a Creator to be ble&s;&s;ed and adored, a Redeemer to be loved and prai&s;ed.</P>
