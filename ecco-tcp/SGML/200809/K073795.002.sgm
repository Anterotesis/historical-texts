<L>Scene once of taste and elegance,</L>

<LG>
<L>One year (unwonted in that Isle)</L>
<L>Incessant rains oppress'd the soil,</L>

<L>And Nature own'd a general dearth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AVARE, with wealth and pride o'ergrown,</L>
<L>Who knew no interest but his own,</L>
<L>Who never sought the dreary shed,</L>

Who could rebuke, with ruthless low'r,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>DURAND heard all, but homeward sped</L>
<L>With musing gait, and downcast head,</L>
<L>And at the closing hour of rest,</L>
<L>The great Creator thus address'd:</L>

<LG>
<PB N="60" REF="54">
<L>"Father of All, who know'st my heart,</L>

<L>"Of means to succour while possess'd,</L>

<LG>

<L>In soft repose his senses steep,</L>
<L>In blissful dreams he pass'd the night,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>As the Author of the following Work does not presume either to support or deny the REALITY of APPARITIONS, he chuses to decline all unneces|sary suggestions on a subject, wherein every person has a right to enjoy his own opinion undisturbed; and, as it was conceived with a view of instruction, and the whole tendency is moral and just, he hopes, with the generality of readers, to pass uncensured for treating them with SO PECULIAR A STORY.</P>
<P>If there should remain any over-scrupulous, or over-witty persons, who are inclined per|emptorily
<PB N="138" REF="123">
to condemn, or illiberally to deride him, he begs leave to answer them with the sentiments of Mr. ADDISON on such subjects, and those of LUCRETIUS and JOSEPHUS, quoted by him, in the second volume of his Spectator.</P>
<Q>I think a person, who is thus terrified with the imaginations of GHOSTS and SPECTRES, much more reasonable than one, who, con|trary to the reports of all historians, sacred and profane, antient and modern, and to the traditions of all nations, thinks the APPEAR|ANCE of SPIRITS fabulous and groundless.&mdash;Could I not give myself up to this general testimony of mankind, I should to the rela|tions of particular persons, who are now liv|ing, and whom I cannot distrust in other matters of fact.</Q>
<P><PB N="139" REF="124">
So far Mr. ADDISON's own opinion&mdash;he then proceeds&mdash;</P>
<Q>LUCRETIUS himself, though, by the course of his philosophy, he was obliged to maintain that the soul did not exist separate from the body, makes no doubt of the REALITY OF AP|PARITIONS, AND THAT MEN HAVE OFTEN AP|PEARED AFTER THEIR DEATH.</Q>
<P>And further having related, from JOSEPHUS, a circumstance of this kind, which befel GLA|PHIRA, daughter of ARCHELAUS, he closes his discourse thus: <Q>The example deserves to be taken notice of, as it contains a most certain proof of the IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, and of DIVINE PROVIDENCE.&mdash;If any man thinks these facts incredible, let him enjoy his own
<PB N="140" REF="125">
opinion to himself; but let him not endea|vour to disturb the belief of others, who, by INSTANCES OF THIS NATURE ARE EXCITED TO THE STUDY OF VIRTUE.</Q></P>
<P>To the testimony of this excellent modern writer might likewise be added the many striking uses which have been made, and the noble purposes of justice which have been ef|fected, through the means of such EXTRAORDI|NARY APPEARANCES, by several of our ancient Poets, and particularly by that honour to Na|ture and Genius, our own immortal SHAKE|SPEARE.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVANTAGES OF <HI>REPENTANCE.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following Tale was given to the Public above twenty years ago, unconnected with any other work. It had the good fortune to pass through four editions; but the whole impression having been long since sold off, it is, at the earnest request of the Author's friends, subjoined to the present collection.</NOTE></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DREADFUL the state of him, whose harden'd heart</L>
<L>Remorse could never pierce! whose early youth,</L>
<L>To evil prone, hath drank the bitter cup</L>
<L>Of Guilt, regardless of the poison misery,</L>
<L>Wherewith it is imbrued, till all his veins</L>
<L><PB N="142" REF="127">
Are fill'd and bloated with the dang'rous venom,</L>
<L>And Health and Ease are flown! mature in life,</L>
<L>Grown ripe in wickedness, and swoln with crimes,</L>
<L>Who finds his malady, yet dares refuse</L>
<L>The sweet and wholesome draught of Penitence,</L>
<L>Which the distemper'd mind's physician, Con|science,</L>
<L>Even to the worst of men will deign to offer.</L>
<L>Him sleepless nights and loaded days weigh down</L>
<L>To blackness and despair; to him remembrance</L>
<L>Is as a fiend, that watches all his steps,</L>
<L>Stands in his path, and intercepts his walk;</L>
<L>Makes ev'n the rushing wind alarm his sense,</L>
<L>As if some power, more than natural,</L>
<L>Rode on the gale; while, at the gloom of eve,</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="128">
From room to room, through all the house he flies,</L>
<L>Scar'd by affright&mdash;and seeks, (alas! how vain!)</L>
<L>A moment's peace. At length, deep furrow'd age,</L>
<L>The herald of his dreadful end, appears,</L>
<L>But to foretel the fatal stroke, and ring</L>
<L>Loud peals of torment in his ears&mdash;he dies</L>
<L>Reluctant&mdash;screaming&mdash;fearing ev'n to lose</L>
<L>A being which he loaths&mdash;in his last pang,</L>
<L>Vainly he rolls his struggling eye-balls round,</L>
<L>To catch a single ray to cheer his mind&mdash;</L>
<L>But all is dark and comfortless&mdash;he dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so the Man of Virtue&mdash;youth to him</L>
<L>Is the fair plain of bliss; his riper years</L>
<L>Are the deep mines of wisdom, whence he draws</L>
<L>Discretion, temp'rance, and a thousand rich</L>
<L>Materials, to improve his after hours</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="129">
With profit and delight; when Memory,</L>
<L>Clad like a guardian spirit, a chaplet brings</L>
<L>Rich with the flow'rs he cultur'd in his youth,</L>
<L>And crowns his honest brow. Thence silver'd age</L>
<L>Seems as the treasury of hoarded good,</L>
<L>Joys well preserv'd&mdash;and Death the blessed vale</L>
<L>Of Hope and Expectation&mdash;the dear path</L>
<L>To happiness immortal!&mdash;to his GOD.</L>
<L>Such was the state of SHENSTONE, virtuous man,</L>
<L>'Who walk'd through goodness, as he walk'd through life,' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Visions in Verse, Page 73.</NOTE></L>
<L>Whom the Muse lov'd, and ever will lament;</L>
<L>Fair wisdom, truth, and sense of gen'rous worth</L>
<L>Sat comely on his brow; within his eye</L>
<L>Sweet charity, and meek humility,</L>
<L><PB N="145" REF="130">
Play'd lovely, and within his ample heart</L>
<L>The milk of human kindness copious flow'd.</L>
<L>Thus blameless, fearless, with a graceful smile</L>
<L>He met his fate, and sought his native skies. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. SHENSTONE died in his arm-chair, with a gentle sigh, and a smile on his countenance.</NOTE></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet let not un-enlighten'd minds suppose</L>
<L>No middle state between the extremes of Vice</L>
<L>And Virtue:&mdash;He, who made, well knows his creatures,</L>
<L>How weak, how frail; and if, perchance, awhile</L>
<L>(As in the best it may) incautious youth</L>
<L>Hath suffer'd truth and constancy to slumber</L>
<L>Within the breast, and, their best guard, Dis|cretion,</L>
<L>Desert his charge, or slacken in his duty,</L>
<L>He looks with sorrowing eye.&mdash;Hear this, ye rigid,</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="131">
And if, by happier talents, ye have gain'd</L>
<L>Perfection's mount, at least, with pity view,</L>
<L>With mildness judge the wretch, whom human weakness,</L>
<L>And venial errors doom to lag beneath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>REPENTANCE is the means, through Heaven's dear grace,</L>
<L>Which from the blotted sheet of life can wipe</L>
<L>A thousand errors; and the King of Heav'n</L>
<L>Hath mercy and compassion, more, I trust,</L>
<L>Than man hath pow'r of sinning. Hence, be warn'd,</L>
<L>Ye wicked tribe! ne'er think the hour too late,</L>
<L>The crime too black, the means of grace too distant.</L>
<L>They cannot be, if true remorse of heart,</L>
<L>And sorrow for the crime, attends your pray'r;</L>
<L>However bad, betake you to your knees;</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="132">
Think ye address your Counsellor, your friend,</L>
<L>Your father, who with readiness of love</L>
<L>Will raise, and comfort his repentant child,</L>
<L>And lead him to the mansions of delight,</L>
<L>Rescrv'd for such as love his holy laws.</L>
<L>Nay, ev'n on earth, or Time's recorded page</L>
<L>Is sullied with untruth, the virtue, penitence,</L>
<L>Hath met a large reward.&mdash;Is there who doubts?</L>
<L>With candid patience let him here peruse</L>
<L>The moral tale, which in expression weak,</L>
<L>And tuneless numbers, I attempt to sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice had the sun renew'd his annual course,</L>
<L>Since hapless EDWARD, on the sultry plains</L>
<L>Of India, had endur'd encreasing woes,</L>
<L>And number'd all his moments by afflictions.</L>
<L>When the fourth year began to store the earth</L>
<L>With fruits and flow'rs, (unlimited expanse,</L>
<L>And prodigality of bounty), EDWARD</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="133">
Arose, one morn, cheer'd by refreshing sleep,</L>
<L>Which long had been a stranger to his bed.</L>
<L>His heart was light within him, and his eye</L>
<L>Look'd clear around; the dross within his breast,</L>
<L>Which lim'd his soul to guilt, seem'd purg'd away;</L>
<L>He heav'd the soft'ning sigh, and, as by instinct,</L>
<L>Bent low to Heav'n&mdash;a posture new to him!</L>
<L>He did not pray&mdash;he knew not what to ask;</L>
<L>While thus 'twixt doubt and sore dismay sus|pended,</L>
<L>Officious Mem'ry set before his view</L>
<L>An awful register of sad misdeeds;</L>
<L>He gaz'd astonish'd:&mdash;here, a dow'rless sister</L>
<L>Upbraided him, for leaving her, at large</L>
<L>To wander through a false and treacherous world,</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="134">
Without a brother's safe-conducting hand:</L>
<L>There, a weak mother, sore oppress'd with age</L>
<L>And poverty, let fall a sacred drop,</L>
<L>And cried, "Thus is it with me."&mdash;Down he sunk,</L>
<L>And, in a torrent of religious tears,</L>
<L>Let loose the fullness of his swelling heart;</L>
<L>Wide, fast, and copious did they flow; as erst</L>
<L>The streams forth delug'd from the harden'd rock,</L>
<L>Touch'd, and resolv'd by MOSES' holy wand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His pains a-while reliev'd, EDWARD aloud</L>
<L>Discharg'd his grief; "Ah woe is me! thus toss'd</L>
<L>"Upon a foreign shore, robb'd of relief,</L>
<L>"Of hope; no sorrowing sister to condole,</L>
<L>"No mother to advise! no more I boast</L>
<L>"A feeling friend, to share my nearest woe,</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="135">
"And ease me of a part; where is the man,</L>

<L>"Embitter'd by distress! Oh! were that morsel</L>

<L>"And, far as mem'ry will admit, may cure</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>He spoke, and rose&mdash;then to his custom'd task</L>
<L>Flew nimbly; gladness in his eye, and speed</L>
<L>Play'd on his feet; no more the hard-earn'd meal</L>
<L>Seem'd tasteless; but, by quick concoction, turn'd</L>
<L>To florid health, and vigour, while the draught</L>
<L>Ran fresh within the veins, and quicken'd life.</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="138">
He toil'd, he prosper'd&mdash;every moment gave</L>
<L>Some large addition to his store, and Heav'n</L>
<L>Indulgent smil'd on all he undertook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean while his mother, tender, good MARIA,</L>
<L>On ALBION's Isle left sorrowing, pin'd away</L>
<L>In anguish for a son; her only stay</L>
<L>In life was lost; her daughter's sole defence;</L>
<L>Since torn from fortune in their earlier days,</L>
<L>His industry alone maintain'd the pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er she ventur'd, all alone, to ope</L>
<L>The volume of her mind, she saw him her's,</L>
<L>And lost, in one sad moment&mdash;snatch'd away,</L>
<L>As 'twere by sudden fate&mdash;one hour the board</L>
<L>Smil'd at his presence, on the next was blank&mdash;</L>
<L>And fruitless every eye look'd forth for ED|WARD:</L>
<L>No traces left of him; his course unknown,</L>
<L><PB N="154" REF="139">
His motives, his distress. In vain, enquiry</L>
<L>Panted on every various wind to find him.</L>
<L>Thus o'er their sorrows did this couple brood,</L>
<L>And drank their falling tears, when ghastly Po|verty</L>
<L>Intruded, and with meagre, hungry look</L>
<L>Appall'd each comely visage; wide he strode,</L>
<L>And, with a horrid joy, cry'd, "All is mine."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What hope remains, alas! for worth distress'd,</L>
<L>And modest want, unless some noble being</L>
<L>Comes timely, like a minister of heav'n,</L>
<L>To succour and redress; in largess wide,</L>
<L>To pour his bounties, and prevent the blush,</L>
<L>Ere yet it rises on the conscious cheek</L>
<L>Of merit, undispos'd, unus'd to ask?</L>
</LG>

<L>Such was MARIA's happy lot! (ah! would</L>

To kindle warmth, and sooth back wand'ring breath;</L>
<L>Supplying thus, with charitable care,</L>
<L>The sacred task of two enfeebled children,</L>

<L>That load of anguish; but worn out, at last,</L>
<L>Despoil'd of all their strength, perforce, they gave</L>

The elder girl, on whom some fourteen years</L>

<L>Now the tough father of the bounteous cot,</L>

<L>Weak nature now, in some degree, repair'd,</L>

"His purpos'd mercy for&s;eit!" Mild discourse</L>

<L><PB N="195" REF="180">
Beside his couch, in zeal precipitate,</L>
<L>Plunging upon his knees, "Almighty Father,</L>

<L>His suit was heard; and Sleep, on downy plumes</L>

<L>When, to his mental eye, the very phantom,</L>

While drops of comfort, from each sacred breath,</L>
