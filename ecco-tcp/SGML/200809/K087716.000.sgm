<L>AS now I come unarm'd, without a dart,</L>
<L>I fear I can't pre&s;ume to touch your heart;</L>
<L>But your indulgence, here &s;o often &s;ound,</L>
<L>Has on my heart, at lea&s;t, impre&s;t a wound;</L>
<L>A &s;acred wound! which I am proud to feel,</L>

<L>Methinks I hear you &s;ay, Dear Mrs. <HI>POPE,</HI></L>
<L>Amid&s;t what mould'ring Annals did you grope,</L>
<L>And dig, from out the mine of tragic ore,</L>
<L>A tale unfa&s;hion'd from the days of yore&mdash;</L>
<L>Where two wild Boys take &s;uch prodigious pains,</L>
