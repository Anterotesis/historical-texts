<P>HAVING, through your in|dulgence, peru&s;ed a manu|&s;cript, which, from its &s;ub&s;tance, &s;hould become the property of the public; it is a great &s;atisfaction, to find that the Author hath been
<PB N="iv" REF="3">prevailed upon to yield it up.&mdash; No &s;ubject can be more important, than one which involves the happi|ne&s;s of our country: none in which mi&s;takes can be more fatal.&mdash;The <HI>internal</HI> intere&s;ts of IRELAND, lye within a &s;mall compa&s;s; the employ|ment of our people in u&s;eful indu&s;|try, and &s;ecurity to individuals in the pur&s;uit of it. On this principle it was, that our <HI>penal laws,</HI> became lately a matter of con&s;ideration in our own HOUSE OF COMMONS, and certainly no &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, re|quires to be more fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.&mdash;
<PB N="v" REF="4">One gentleman in particular, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in the debate, and pronounced the Speech, now happily drawn (through your hands) from the Shades of the clo&s;et. On the day of its being delivered, it made an impre&s;&s;ion, where impre&s;&s;ion &s;hould begin. The contents flew rapidly from the Hou&s;e to the people, and became the principal topic of every conver&s;ation. The Speaker's great powers gave &s;plendor to argu|ment, and &s;u&s;picion could not fall on eloquence, when it was &s;een that every ray of illumination, converged
<PB N="vi" REF="5">to a &s;ingle point; to the good of his country.&mdash;&mdash;Taking political philo|&s;ophy for his guide, he could not lo&s;e his way;&mdash;in that way he could not walk alone, but collected the united powers of the heart and head, to lead others <HI>into it.</HI> His abun|dance bore on his hearers, like a torrent, which confirmed habits of thinking could hardly re&s;i&s;t.&mdash; He &s;hewed; he proved, that the pro&s;perity of this nation can never be obtained from the depre&s;&s;ion of two thirds of the people, born to labour, and who mu&s;t be de&s;titute
<PB N="vii" REF="6">of every convenience of life without it.&mdash;That the improvement of this country cannot be expected from men virtually forbid by law <HI>to em|prove</HI>; from men limited in landed tenures, and from tenures limited in profit.</P>
<P>BUT the truths delivered, and the truths implied in the Speech it&s;elf, mu&s;t come very faintly from the delineation of a common hand. They will be exhibited by you, Sir, in their full lu&s;tre, from the colouring of a great ma&s;ter, who has already freed &s;ome, from the captivity of pre|occupation,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">and taught them to &s;ub|&s;titute knowledge to opinion; as a preliminary to the &s;ub&s;titution of confidence to jealou&s;y.&mdash;This &s;urely is beginning well, before the pre|&s;cription of nece&s;&s;ity comes too late, for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;ickly public.</P>

<HEAD>A SPEECH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. FORSTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Que&s;tion at pre&s;ent before us may be con&s;idered in two lights, either as a &s;cheme for induc|ing Papi&s;ts to contribute to the
<PB N="2" REF="9">population and improvement of corporate towns, by allowing them to take lots for building; or, to the cultivation of the country in general, by permitting them to have &s;mall portions of land, with a more advantageous tenure in their lea&s;es than they were before entitled to, from the circum&s;criptions they labour under, in con&s;equence of the &s;everal &s;tatutes in force again&s;t them: or, the Bill may be con&s;i|dered as one &s;tep towards the par|tial repeal of a body of laws, which
<PB N="3" REF="10">have been e&s;teemed by &s;ome, as one of the principal barriers of our civil and religious con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t view, 'tis certainly an object of &s;ome con&s;equence; in the &s;econd, of the utmo&s;t mag|nitude. &mdash;The arguments which have been offered in favour of the Bill, as an expedient for ef|fecting the de&s;irable purpo&s;e held forth in it's title, and in the con|templation of my worthy friend <NOTE>place="foot" n="*" H&mdash;s L&mdash;&s;he, E&s;q.</NOTE> who introduced it, have been
<PB N="4" REF="11">&s;ufficient to convince me, that, there is no danger of prejudice to the e&s;tabli&s;hed intere&s;t of Ireland by our pa&s;&s;ing it into a law: e&s;pe|cially, when there are &s;uch prudent regulations in regard to the power of devi&s;e: therefore, Sir, I &s;hall not take up your time by a repetition of rea&s;ons which you have heard already, with much greater weight to the &s;ame point, from other gen|tlemen; but I beg your indulgence, while I deliver my &s;entiments on this &s;ubject in a more comprehen&s;ive
<PB N="5" REF="12">view than it will admit of, if con|tracted to the narrow bottom of the fir&s;t &s;imple con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>As I intend to give my vote in favour of the Bill, 'tis a great &s;a|tisfaction to me, to find it admitted on all &s;ides, that, the laws of Ireland again&s;t Popery are in many re&s;pects incon&s;i&s;tent with true religion and rectitude, not to be ju&s;tified in &s;e|veral in&s;tances on &s;piritual or moral principles, but as they fir&s;t &s;prung from nece&s;&s;ity, can be&s;t be &s;up|ported
<PB N="6" REF="13">by the predominancy of that plea only.</P>
<P>THERE is, Sir, no principle of natural ju&s;tice more clear, no pre|cept of moral policy more evident, than, that the rigour of penal &s;ta|tutes ought not to extend beyond the bounds ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance and good order of &s;ociety; when they tran&s;gre&s;s &s;uch limits, every foundation of reliance between the legi&s;lature and the people, is &s;haken: &s;uch laws be|come
<PB N="7" REF="14">the terror, not the protection of the &s;ubject; he walks under them, not as under the friendly roof which is to &s;helter him from the furious &s;torm of wild unbridled outrage, but, like the tottering wall that every moment may cru&s;h him by its ca&s;ual ruin; accident, not ju&s;tice, is his deliverer; nor can he boa&s;t, that, committing no offence, he fear|ed no puni&s;hment; his mi&s;erable con&s;olation is, that, with innocence at his &s;ide, he had the good for|tune to e&s;cape it.&mdash;As natural
<PB N="8" REF="15">ju&s;tice is the principle, common be|nefit is the end of &s;tate penalties. Let the dreary tracts of de&s;olate and uncultivated territory, in every pro|vince of your kingdom, proclaim how this end has been defeated by your penal &s;tatutes again&s;t Popery; the hu&s;bandman will not turn up the earth, nor the &s;ower put down the grain, when they know another is to reap the fruits of their toil and indu&s;try.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed, Sir, as this i&s;land is by fertility of &s;oil and tem|perature of climate, we have often
<PB N="9" REF="16">endeavoured to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of its partial barrenne&s;s and depo|pulation. Sometimes we complain, that our relative and dependent &s;itu|ation on a too powerful neighbour, has dried up the &s;prings of indu&s;try; &s;ometimes we &s;ay, the rigorous ex|actions of our landlords damp all vigour and exertion in the in|ferior cla&s;&s;es of our pea&s;antry: and &s;ometimes, with li&s;tle&s;s de&s;pondency, we &s;upinely acquie&s;ce under the lazy reproach of national &s;loth and inac|tivity: but, we carefully avert our
<PB N="10" REF="17">eyes from the&s;e acts of our fore|fathers, more prohibitory than the jealous and illiberal policy of a &s;i&s;ter country, more fraught with oppre&s;&s;ion than the unfeeling rapa|city of our many-acred landholders, more productive of inertne&s;s than the unmerited character of national indolence.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t &s;peak with deference of the&s;e laws, while they are yet in being; but, were they once annul|led, humanity would exult over
<PB N="11" REF="18">their abrogation: it would &s;ay, they were unlike all other legal promul|gations; not the bridle, but the &s;pur to wickedne&s;s; tempting, not re|&s;training the mo&s;t dangerous pa&s;&s;i|ons; encouraging, not cha&s;ti&s;ing the wor&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. The juri&s;pru|dence of other civilized governments knows them not; the univer&s;al in|&s;tinct of nature di&s;claims them. Can the partial code of any community, or of the greate&s;t nation, drown the univer&s;al voice of nature; or can volumes of parchment confront her
<PB N="12" REF="19">ordinances? Divine and natural pre|cepts &s;ay, <Q> Honour him who gave  you being:</Q>the popery laws of Ireland &s;ay, <Q> Betray and beggar him.</Q> &mdash;To knit more clo&s;ely the endearing ties of private faith and of dome&s;tic &s;ecurity, has been the fa|vourite aim of every poli&s;hed legi&s;|lature: this angry code makes them the objects of &s;crutiny, and the prey of the informer: it ran&s;acks the oeconomy of families, excites the in|tere&s;t of the &s;on again&s;t his filial duty, converts the brother into a
<PB N="13" REF="20">&s;py; nay, the marriage-bed (that la&s;t a&s;&s;ylum of repo&s;e and tenderne&s;s) it di&s;turbs with perpetual apprehen|&s;ions of di&s;covery and &s;eparation.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim, Sir, and a &s;ound one, that the &s;trict execution of every unrepealed law, is the part of clemency and wi&s;dom. How is this con&s;i&s;tent with our policy? The pledge of our &s;ecurity, we are told, is, that the&s;e laws may be always put in execution; the boa&s;t of our humanity is, that they are &s;eldom
<PB N="14" REF="21">executed. For my part, Sir, I know little di&s;ference between the appre|hen&s;ion and the exi&s;tence of a dan|ger. The wor&s;t of every evil is the fear. I would rather be pierced at once to the Heart, than have the &s;word of the tyrant for ever &s;u&s;pend|ed over me.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o, Sir, another maxim, equally incontrovertible with the former. That, clemency ought rather to re&s;ide in a body of laws, than in the private feeling of
<PB N="15" REF="22">any individual. Our penal &s;y&s;tem again&s;t Popery is har&s;h and re&s;tric|tive to the utmo&s;t extent of un&s;an|guinary rigour. It ri&s;es &s;tatute after &s;tatute, and clau&s;e after clau&s;e, to the con&s;ummation of legi&s;lative &s;everity. The unhappy objects of this code are &s;ometimes obliged to the inadvertency, &s;ometimes to the indolence, often to the humanity of their orthodox brethren; but the letter and &s;pirit of the edict are their deadly enemies, and under this &s;anc|tion, intere&s;t, or revenge, caprice or
<PB N="16" REF="23">malignity may gorge and riot to the &s;ating of every appetite.</P>
<P>It is true, Sir, our market places don't as formerly blaze with the fires of martyrdom, &s;caffolds do not reek with noble blood, nor are gibbets loaded with human carca&s;&s;es; and as the bloody &s;pirit of pa&s;t times is &s;pent, &s;o is the enthu&s;ia&s;tic. Bigo|try, the di&s;ea&s;e of weak minds, and &s;uper&s;tition, the di&s;grace of true piety, are now rarely to be found, even in convents or in cloy&s;ters,
<PB N="17" REF="24">though they abound in the annals of former ages, but not in our expe|rience, nor among&s;t our contempo|raries. What is the complaint of churchmen all over Europe? not, that the laity are wedded to parti|cular tenets and doctrines, and are ready with un&s;haken con&s;tancy to commute the world for con&s;cience; but that Religion has lo&s;t it's &s;trong gra&s;p on the minds of all men, and that decency, or cu&s;tom at be&s;t, are become it's lukewarm &s;ub&s;titutes. The rea&s;on, Sir, is obvious. The
<PB N="18" REF="25">pompous glare and pageantry of the Romi&s;h ritual were well calculated for the ages of ignorance and dark|ne&s;s, when it had greate&s;t preva|lence. Captivated by gawdy pro|ce&s;&s;ions, and allured by the enchant|ments of harmony, the delu&s;ion of the &s;en&s;es was often mi&s;taken for the conviction of the under&s;tanding; and as it an&s;wered every purpo&s;e of a proud and ambitious hierarchy, was long &s;ub&s;tituted for, and made the te&s;t of devotion. But the&s;e &s;acred &s;arces have been too often
<PB N="19" REF="26">exhibited, the very externals of re|&s;pect to the&s;e pious mummeries are now enforced by the &s;ecular autho|rity; nor can the &s;uppo&s;ed real pre|&s;ence of the Deity, that mo&s;t exalted my&s;tery of their holy profanation, extort a genuflexion, till the fixed bayonet of the &s;oldier commands the unwilling reverence.&mdash;I my&s;elf have &s;een it.</P>
<P>The amenability of our fellow|&s;ubjects, of a different communion, has been often urged in their favour,
<PB N="20" REF="27">and has as often been overturned by the &s;teady per&s;everance of their de|termined opponents. Again&s;t a demeanour, on their part loyal, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive and dutiful, for now near an hundred years, are produced two or three meagre examples of petulance and contumacy among the very re|fu&s;e of their people. Again&s;t a great principle of humanity and national policy, are &s;tarted a remote appre|hen&s;ion, and a po&s;&s;ible inconvenience, and we are in&s;tructed to conclude, that, as terror, not conviction, has
<PB N="21" REF="28">wrought their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and our &s;afety, it would be a &s;pecies of vir|tual &s;uicide to relax any thing of our former &s;everity; nay, we &s;hould ra|ther &s;well the ma&s;&s;ey volume of premunires, amercements, commina|tions and interdicts.</P>
<P>But in my judgment, Sir, we fru&s;trate all hopes of uniformity, by mi&s;taking the means of conver&s;ion. &mdash;The mild genius of toleration every day makes pro&s;elytes, it heaps coals of fire on re&s;i&s;tance and pre|judice,
<PB N="22" REF="29">and melts them down to ac|quie&s;cence and conformity. Per&s;e|cution animates di&s;obedience, and multiplies the refractory. Is the &s;pirit of Popery weak and timorous? Subdue it not with pains, nor frighten it by penalties. Is it acrimonious, per&s;evering, vindictive?&mdash;Give not rancour the eternal food of gall|ing &s;tatutes, and ignominious cir|cum&s;criptions. Take a link or two from the heavy iron load of the&s;e legal fetters, and bind your fellow|&s;ubjects by the gentler ties of grati|tude
<PB N="23" REF="30">and affection.&mdash;In what hi&s;|tory of any country has it been found, that per&s;ecution rooted out religious here&s;ies, or terrified men into the pale of e&s;tabli&s;hment? In none that I have read or heard of. Non-conformi&s;ts mingle peaceably and amicably with other members of whatever &s;tate they live in, till the bla&s;t of intolerance drives them toge|ther. Then they &s;eparate from the &s;tate, then &s;elf-pre&s;ervation &s;ets them on contrivance, then they grow di&s;|contented and unhappy; no wonder
<PB N="24" REF="31">they &s;hould become de&s;perate and dangerous.&mdash;But after all, Sir, 'tis not the mode of faith, 'tis not the ceremonial of wor&s;hip, 'tis not the point of controver&s;y, 'tis the point of honour that re&s;i&s;ts your confi&s;ca|tions, pains, and penalties. 'Tis not the di&s;ciple of Calvin, nor the wor&s;hipper of &s;aints and idols; 'tis not the religioni&s;t, but the MAN, who kindles again&s;t menaces and dangers.</P>
<P>OUR ance&s;tors pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch laws, becau&s;e they were nece&s;&s;ary. Their
<PB N="25" REF="32">times required them. That nece&s;&s;ity is over, tho&s;e times are altered. The Royal Succe&s;&s;ion and the religion of the&s;e countries is e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond the power of &s;ubver&s;ion. Our So|vereign reigns in the intere&s;ts and in the hearts of his people, while the de&s;titute pretender to his right wanders from court to court, the burden of every petty &s;tate, and the outca&s;t of every powerful. The for|mer adherents to his line, wretched them&s;elves and friendle&s;s, &s;carce re|member his name, but by their af|flictions, and with a contemptuous
<PB N="26" REF="33">retro&s;pect to his baffled projects for royalty. Our Monarch gives laws to Europe; kingly diadems have receiv|ed &s;tipends and &s;ub&s;idies from his bounty and his opulence, while the hou&s;e of Stuart can hardly obtain a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from their charity. What could not be effected when the&s;e principles were in their bloom and vigour, when intere&s;t, revenge, ca|pacity, and power united in the quarrel, and ranked under the &s;ame banners; will it now be attempted, when &s;uch claims are antiquated and &s;uch di&s;tinctions forgotten?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="34">
WHEN the body of Jacobiti&s;m has long been laid quietly in the du&s;t, &s;hall the wi&s;dom of Parliament realize the fears of childhood and tremble at its apparition?</P>
<P>No man, Sir, is more inclined than I am to pay all due deference to the wi&s;dom of our fore-fathers, and to the &s;anctity of pre&s;cription; but never were laws of this nature framed without &s;ome tincture of the times they pa&s;&s;ed in. Sub&s;equent experience matures and mellows what was crude and undige&s;ted in earlier determinations. We &s;urely,
<PB N="28" REF="35">Sir, mi&s;take our duty, and relin|qui&s;h one of the mo&s;t valuable rights of Parliament, if we &s;uppo&s;e any antecedent law is too &s;acred for modern touch, and that the&s;e e&s;pe|cially, like old medals, will lo&s;e their value, if the venerable ru&s;t of antiquity is rubbed off by the handling. Can it, Sir, be a dange|rous innovation, to attempt the mitigation of laws, which have had already all the effect and opera|tion they were intended to pro|duce? Laws, of which the acri|mony only remains while the &s;pirit
<PB N="29" REF="36">is evaporated. Is it an in&s;tance of &s;hort &s;ighted policy to attach three fourths of the community to the pre&s;ervation of the whole? When we have failed to induce them by principle, to try what can be effected by intere&s;t?&mdash;To make the coun|try they inhabit dear to our fellow &s;ubjects, by &s;ome more rational tye than the fortuitous circum&s;tance of its being the place of their nativity. Is it an uncon&s;titutional endeavour to diffu&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings of a mild and beneficent government to every order and di&s;tinction of the people? A
<PB N="30" REF="37">government, the immunities of which become every day more precious in this country, from the excellent character of that incomparable per&s;on into who&s;e hands is delegated its executive authority. Is it ra&s;h and un|advi&s;ed, to convert di&s;content into &s;atisfaction, poverty into opu|lence, &s;loth into indu&s;try, and in|difference to the commonwealth into zeal for the general pro&s;perity? &mdash;This Bill, and every one of a &s;imilar tendency, are &s;o many &s;teps
<PB N="31" REF="38">to &s;uch de&s;ireable purpo&s;es: as &s;uch, I hope, we &s;hall advance to meet it. This Bill does not give to Papi&s;ts the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or the u&s;e of arms, which may be wielded again&s;t the religion or the liberty of Prote&s;tants. It does not inve&s;t them with the offices of &s;tate, or with the powers of government: It allows them no coercive authority over the con|&s;cience or the property of the re|formed. It only induces them, by a permanent and valuable depo&s;it, to di&s;pen&s;e that wealth they have earned by indu&s;try, to the improve|ment
<PB N="32" REF="39">of a country, where hitherto, Sir, they have &s;ojourned but as &s;trangers. It gives them a freight in the general ve&s;&s;el, to who&s;e wreck or pro&s;perity they were before in|different. It &s;ecures their co-opera|tion by their partner&s;hip, and grap|ples their allegiance by their intere&s;t.</P>
