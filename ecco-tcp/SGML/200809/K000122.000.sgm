<HEAD>THE BRICKLAYER'S POEM, TO THE Counte&s;s of CHESTERFIELD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>WHAT means this di&s;mal Sound, that March &s;o &s;low,</L>
<L>This &s;olemn Sadne&s;s, and this Pomp of Woe?</L>
<L>Why hangs that Horror on the Soldier's Mien?</L>
<L>Why droop the Multitude? What means the Scene?</L>
<L>Behold! two Victims, pale and trembling, led,</L>
<L>Already number'd with the mould'ring dead;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="025090030000030">What gha&s;tly Terrors on each Brow we trace!</L>
<L>See Death imprinted on each dying Face!</L>
<L>Frail Nature bends beneath the pond'rous Woe,</L>
<L>And prone to Death would fain prevent the Blow:</L>
<L>Yet Love of Life a&s;&s;erts its eager Claim,</L>
<L>But Hope, alas! affords no flatt'ring Gleam.</L>
<L>Lo! the pale King in horrid Pomp appears!</L>
<L>What cruel Eye could then refrain from Tears?</L>
<L>What Heart relentle&s;s, then, forbear to melt?</L>
<L>Who &s;aw their Sorrows, but like Sorrows felt?</L>
<L>How &s;ad the Conflict! how &s;evere the Strife</L>
<L>Of Wretches, clinging to the Verge of Life!</L>
<L>When angry Ju&s;tice claim'd her de&s;tin'd Prey;</L>
<L>And frown'd, vindictive, on the kind Delay:</L>
<L>(Thy &s;aving Mercy, in that Moment flew,</L>
<L>The darling Attribute of Heav'n and You):</L>
<L>To &s;oft Compa&s;&s;ion won thy willing Lord,</L>
<L>His Ju&s;tice temp'ring &s;heath'd th' uplifted Sword.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="025090030000040">And in that fearful, that tremendous Hour,</L>
<L>Snatch'd the pale Victims from th' offended Pow'r.</L>
<L>As when by adver&s;e Stars or Chance mi&s;led,</L>
<L>Entic'd by Lucre, or pur&s;u'd by Dread,</L>
<L>A Wretch from &s;ome high Rock's &s;tupendous Brow,</L>
<L>Hangs o'er the Waves, and dreadful Depths below.</L>
<L>The &s;lender Bough he gra&s;ps, his only Stay,</L>
<L>Yields to his Weight, and more and more gives way;</L>
<L>Of Hope abandon'd, as the Branch he tears,</L>
<L>He views th' Aby&s;s, and, as he views, de&s;pairs,</L>
<L>'Till &s;ome unhop'd for Hand prevents his Doom,</L>
<L>Lifts him to Life, and lengthen'd Years to come:</L>
<L>Redeem'd from Fate, nor yet re&s;tor'd to Life,</L>
<L>They wond'ring pau&s;e, and feel a doubtful Strife;</L>
<L>If &s;till on Earth they breathe with human Race,</L>
<L>Or mix with Shades in Death's ob&s;cure Embrace;</L>
<L>'Till dawning Hope the dubious Horror clears,</L>
<L>Confirms their Safety, and di&s;pels their Fears:</L>

<L>Then human Blood &s;hould deluge Earth no more,</L>
