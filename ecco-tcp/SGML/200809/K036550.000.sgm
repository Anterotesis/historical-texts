<L>Plain folk above, and finer folk below,</L>
<L>All &s;it to try an anxious Author's cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Each by its own, and all by different laws.</L>
<L>This beauteous circle, friends to poli&s;h'd ver&s;e,</L>

<L>While the &s;tern Pit all ornament di&s;dains,</L>

<L>The middle order, free from critick pride,</L>
<L>Take genuine nature for their faithful guide;</L>
<L>At ears and eyes they drink the full delight,</L>
<L>And judge, but as they feel, of wrong and right:</L>
<L>While tho&s;e above them, hone&s;t &s;ouls! delight in</L>
<L>Proce&s;&s;ions, bu&s;tle, trumpets, drums, and fighting.</L>
<L>Hard as it is, we think our Play to-night</L>

<L>To &s;hield him from the critick's treachery;</L>
<L>Who, with &s;ly rules upon your judgement &s;tealing,</L>
<L>Would &s;et your pride again&s;t your hone&s;t feeling;</L>

<L>Permit me, ere I go, one &s;hort relation,</L>

<L>A home-&s;pun country '&s;quire, who took his &s;tand</L>

<DIV1 TYPE="epilogue">
<P>THE following EPILOGUE, which was &s;poken on the fir&s;t two nights of the exhibition of this tragedy, was obligingly written by R. J. GOODENOUGH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who did not know that an Epilogue had been prepared for it by Mr. Malone, at the Author's reque&s;t.</P>
<LG>
<L>'TIS an old maxim with dramatick &s;ages,</L>
<L>To draw their tragick lore from di&s;tant ages.</L>
<L>The ruder manners, and impetuous vein,</L>
<L>Which no trim rules of <HI>etiquette</HI> re&s;train;</L>
<L>The gen'rous plainne&s;s of th' unpractis'd heart,</L>
<L>Nature's free powers yet un&s;ubdued by art;</L>
<L>The rough &s;implicity,&mdash;the dark&s;ome time,&mdash;</L>
<L>Improve the <HI>pathos,</HI>&mdash;heighten the &s;ublime:</L>
<L>While all the Poet's deepe&s;t &s;kill might fail,</L>
<L>If us'd to decorate &s;ome modern tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In me you've &s;een a wife&mdash;who, though abhorr'd,</L>
<L>Abandon'd, threaten'd by her tyrant Lord,</L>
<L><PB REF="92">Did patient long her firm affection prove,</L>
<L>'Mid&s;t the keen tortures of in&s;ulted love.</L>
<L>You've &s;een a maiden&mdash;fair, and nobly born,</L>
<L>Attach'd to merit, wretched and forlorn;</L>
<L>And then, her lover, in a mean di&s;gui&s;e,</L>
<L>In native worth above all titles ri&s;e.</L>
<L>A prie&s;t&mdash;with zeal and holy ardour fraught,</L>
<L>Practi&s;e the le&s;&s;ons which his preaching taught.</L>
<L>&mdash;But while at &s;cenes like the&s;e your bo&s;oms glow,</L>
<L>You'll recollect, they happen'd&mdash;long ago.</L>
<L>In <HI>our</HI> gay times, a wife for&s;aken, &s;corn'd,</L>
<L>Had ne'er in doleful gui&s;e her fortune mourn'd;</L>
<L>But with frail &s;chemes; in fa&s;hionable cour&s;e,</L>
<L>Had been the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to furni&s;h a divorce.</L>
<L>The maiden had her pea&s;ant &s;wain de&s;pis'd,</L>
<L>And &s;tars, and lace, and liv'ries, more had priz'd.</L>
<L>Nor could, in this, perhaps, her choice be blam'd;</L>
<L>For &s;ay, what lover now had other merit claim'd?</L>
<L>As for our prie&s;ts&mdash;in rev'rence let them re&s;t;&mdash;</L>
<L>On modern &s;aints&mdash;the lea&s;t that's &s;aid, is be&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of manners, then, &s;o different in their kind,</L>
<L>The old are rude&mdash;the new are too refin'd.</L>
<L>That author well de&s;erves our warme&s;t prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Who tho&s;e examples which we need di&s;plays.</L>
<L>Who, 'mid&s;t the placid murmurings of <HI>Ton,</HI></L>
<L>Rolls the rough tide of Gothick force along;</L>
<L>And when true worth &s;eems withering at the root,</L>
<L>Turns the rich &s;oil whence towering virtues &s;hoot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ne'er can the Mu&s;e be more our nature's friend,</L>
<L>Than when &s;he &s;trives its wide extremes to blend;</L>
<L>Bids &s;imple truth with poli&s;h'd fa&s;hion join,</L>
<L>And ancient &s;trength with modern grace combine.</L>
