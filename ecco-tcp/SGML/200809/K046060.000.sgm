<HEAD>TAWNY RACHEL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>TAWNY Rachel was the wife of poaching Giles. There &s;eemed to be a con&s;piracy in Giles's whole family to maintain them&s;elves by tricks and pilfering. Regular labour and hone&s;t indu&s;try did not &s;uit their idle habits. They had a &s;ort of ge|nius at finding out every unlawful means to &s;up|port a vagabond life. Rachel travelled the country with a ba&s;ket on her arm. She pretended to get her bread by &s;elling laces, cabbage nets, ballads and hi&s;tory books, and to buy old rags and rabbit &s;kins. Many hone&s;t people trade in the&s;e things, and I am &s;ure I don't mean to &s;ay a word again&s;t hone&s;t people, let them trade in what they will. But Rachel only made this traffic a pretence for getting admittance into farmers' kitchens, in order to tell fortunes. She was continually practi&s;ing on the credulity of &s;illy girls; and took advantage of their ignorance to cheat and deceive them. Many an innocent &s;ervant has &s;he cau&s;ed to be &s;u&s;pected of a robbery. while &s;he her&s;elf, perhaps, was in league with the
<PB N="4" REF="3">
thief. Many a harmle&s;s maid has &s;he brought to ruin by fir&s;t contriving plots and events, and then pretending to foretell them. She had not, to be &s;ure, the power of foretelling things, becau&s;e &s;he had no power of &s;eeing into futurity; but &s;he had the art &s;ometimes to bring them about according as &s;he had foretold them. So &s;he got that credit for her wi&s;dom which really belonged to her wicked|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Rachel was al&s;o a famous interpreter of dreams, and could di&s;tingui&s;h exactly between the fate of any two per&s;ons who happened to have a mole on the right or the left cheek. She had a cunning way of getting her&s;elf off when any of her prophecies failed. When &s;he explained a dream according to the natural appearance of things, and it did not come to pa&s;s; then &s;he would get out of that &s;crape by &s;aying, that "this &s;ort of dreams went by con|traries." Now of two very oppo&s;ite things the chance always is that one of them may turn out to be true; &s;o in either ca&s;e &s;he kept up the cheat.</P>
<P>Rachel in one of her rambles &s;topped at the hou&s;e of Farmer Jenkins. She contrived to call when &s;he knew the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was from home, which indeed was her u&s;ual way. She knocked at the door; the maids being out hay-making, Mrs. Jenkins went to open it her&s;elf. Rachel a&s;ked her if &s;he would plea&s;e to let her light her pipe? This was a common pretence, when &s;he could find no other way of getting into a hou&s;e. While &s;he was filling her pipe, &s;he looked at Mrs. Jenkins and &s;aid, &s;he could tell her &s;ome good fortune. The farmer's wife, who was a very inoffen&s;ive, but a weak and &s;uper&s;titious woman, was curious to know what &s;he meant. Rachel then looked about very
<PB N="5" REF="4">
carefully, and &s;hutting the door with a my&s;terious air, a&s;ked her if &s;he was &s;ure nobody would hear them. This appearance of my&s;tery was at once de|lightful and terrifying to Mrs. Jenkins, who bid the cunning woman &s;peak out. "Then," &s;aid Rachel in a &s;olemn whi&s;per, "there is to my certain know|ledge a pot of money hid under one of the &s;tones in your cellar." "Indeed," &s;aid Mrs. Jenkins, "it is impo&s;&s;ible, for now I think of it, I dreamt la&s;t night I was in pri&s;on for debt." "Did you indeed?" &s;aid Rachel, "that is quite &s;urpri&s;ing. Did you dream before twelve o'clock or after?" "O it was this morning, ju&s;t before I awoke. "Then I am &s;ure it is true, for morning dreams always go by contraries," cried Rachel. "How lucky it was you dreamt it &s;o late." "Mrs. Jenkins could hardly contain her joy, and a&s;ked how the money was to be come at," "There is but one way," &s;aid Rachel, "I mu&s;t go into the cellar. I know by my art under which &s;tone it lies, but I mu&s;t not tell." They then both went down into the cellar, but Rachel refu&s;ed to point at the &s;tone unle&s;s Mrs. Jenkins would put five pieces of gold into a ba&s;on and do as &s;he directed. The &s;imple woman in&s;tead of turning her out of doors for a cheat, did as &s;he was bid. She put the guineas into a ba&s;on which &s;he gave into Rachel's hand. Rachel &s;trewed &s;ome white powder over the gold, muttered &s;ome barbarous words, and pretended to perform the black art. She then told Mrs. Jenkins to put the ba&s;on quietly down within the cellar; telling her that if &s;he offered to look into it, or even to &s;peak a word the charm would be broken. She al&s;o directed her to lock the cellar door, and
<PB N="6" REF="5">
on no pretence to open it in le&s;s than forty eight hours. "If," added &s;he, "you clo&s;ely follow the&s;e directions, then, by the power of my art, you you will find the ba&s;on conveyed to the very &s;tone under which the money lies hid, and a fine trea&s;ure it will be." Mrs. Jenkins, who believed every word the woman &s;aid, did exactly as &s;he was told, and Rachel took her leave with a hand&s;ome reward.</P>
<P>When farmer Jenkins came home he de&s;ired his wife to draw him a cup of cider; this &s;he put off doing &s;o long that he began to be di&s;plea&s;ed. At la&s;t &s;he begged he would drink a little beer in&s;tead. He in&s;i&s;ted on knowing the rea&s;on, and when at la&s;t he grew angry &s;he told him all that had pa&s;t; and owned that as the pot of gold happened to be in the cider cellar, &s;he did not dare open the door, as &s;he was &s;ure it would break the charm. "And it would be a pity you know," &s;aid &s;he, "to lo&s;e a good fortune for the &s;ake of a draught of cider." The farmer, who was not &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, &s;u&s;pected a trick. He demanded the key, and went and opened the cellar door. He found the ba&s;on, and in it five round pieces of tin covered with powder. Mrs. Jenkins bur&s;t out a crying; but the farmer thought of nothing but of getting a warrant to apprehend the cunning woman. Indeed &s;he well proved her claim to that name, when &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that the cellar door might be kept locked till &s;he had time to get out of the reach of all pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Poor Sally Evans! I am &s;ure &s;he rued the day that ever &s;he li&s;tened to a fortune teller! Sally was as harmle&s;s a girl as ever churned a pound of but|ter; but Sally was ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious. She delighted in dream-books, and had con&s;ulted all the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
cunning women in the country to tell her whether the two moles on her cheek denoted that &s;he was to have two hu&s;bands, or only two children. If &s;he picked up an old hor&s;e-&s;hoe going to church &s;he was &s;ure that would he a lucky week. She never made a black-pudding without borrowing one of the Par&s;on's old wigs to hang in the chimney, firmly believing there were no other means to pre&s;erve them from bur&s;ting. She would never go to-bed on Mid&s;ummer eve without &s;ticking up in her room the well known plant called Mid&s;ummer-man, as the bending of the leaves to the right or to the left, would not fail to tell her whether Jacob, of whom we &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently, was true or fal&s;e. She would rather go five miles about than pa&s;s near a church-yard at night. Every &s;eventh year &s;he would not eat beans becau&s;e they grew downward in the pod, in&s;tead of upward; and &s;he would rather have gone with her gown open than have taken a pin of an old woman, for fear of being bewitched. Poor Sally had &s;o many unlucky days in her calendar, that a large portion of her time became of little u&s;e, becau&s;e on the&s;e days &s;he did not dare &s;et about any new work. And &s;he would have refu&s;ed the be&s;t offer if made to her on a Friday, which &s;he thought &s;o unlucky a day that &s;he often &s;aid what a pity it was that there were any Friday in the week! Sally had twenty pounds left her by her grandmother. She had long been courted by Jacob a &s;ober lad with whom &s;he lived fel|low &s;ervant at a creditable farmer's. Hone&s;t Jacob, like his name&s;ake of old, thought it little to wait &s;even years to get this dam&s;el to wife, becau&s;e of the love he bore her, for Sally had promi&s;ed to marry him when he could match her twenty-pounds with another.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
Now there was one Robert, a rambling, idle young gardener, who in&s;tead of &s;itting down &s;teadily in one place, u&s;ed to roam about the country and do odd jobs where he could get them. No one under&s;tood any thing about him, except that he was a down-looking fellow who got his bread nobody knew how, and never had a penny in his pocket. Robert, who was now in the neighbourhood, hap|pened to hear of Sally Evans and her twenty pounds. He conceived a longing de&s;ire for the latter. So be went to his old friend Rachel, told her all he had heard of Sally, and promi&s;ed if &s;he could bring about a marriage between them, &s;he &s;hould go &s;hares in the money.</P>
<P>Rachel undertook the bu&s;ine&s;s. She &s;et off to the farm hou&s;e and fell to &s;inging one of her mo&s;t enticing &s;ongs ju&s;t under the dairy window. Sally was &s;o &s;truck with the pretty tune, which was unhap|pily u&s;ed to &s;et off &s;ome very loo&s;e words, that &s;he jumped up, dropped the &s;kimming di&s;h into the cream and ran out to buy the &s;ong. While &s;he &s;tooped down to rummage the ba&s;ket for the&s;e &s;ongs which had the mo&s;t tragical pictures, for Sally had a tender heart and delighted in whatever was mournful, Rachel looked &s;ted fa&s;tly in her face, and told her &s;he knew by her art that &s;he was born to good fortune, but advi&s;ed her not to throw her&s;elf away. "The&s;e two moles on your cheek," added &s;he, "&s;hew you are in &s;ome danger." Do they de|note hu&s;bands or children," cried Sally? "&s;tartting up, and letting fall the &s;ong of the children in the wood;" "Hu&s;bands," muttered Rachel, "Alas! poor Jacob!" &s;aid Sally mournfully, "then he will die fir&s;t won't he?" "Mum for that," quoth the fortune|teller, "I will &s;ay no more." Sally was impatient,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
but the more curio&s;ity &s;he di&s;covered, the more my&s;tery Rachel affected. At la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, "if you will cro&s;s my hand with a piece of &s;ilver I will tell you your fortune. By the power of my art I can do this three ways; by cards, by the lines of your hand, or by turning a cup of tea-grounds: which will you have?" O, all! all!" cried Sally, looking up with reverence to this &s;un-burnt oracle of wi&s;dom, who knew no le&s;s than three different ways of diving into the &s;ecrets of futurity, Alas! per&s;ons of bet|ter &s;en&s;e than Sally have been &s;o taken in; the more is the pity! The poor girl &s;aid &s;he would run up &s;tairs to her little box where &s;he kept her money tied up in a bit of an old glove, and would bring down a bright queen Ann's &s;ix-pence very crooked. "I am &s;ure," added &s;he, "it is a lucky one, for it cured me of a very bad ague la&s;t &s;pring, by only laying it nine nights under my pillow without &s;peak|ing a word. But then you mu&s;t know what gave the virtue to this &s;ix-pence was, that it had belonged to three young men of the name of John; I am &s;ure I had work enough to get it. But true it is, it certainly cured me. It mu&s;t be the &s;ix-pence you know, for I am &s;ure I did nothing el&s;e for my ague, except indeed taking &s;ome bitter &s;tuff every three hours which the doctor called bark. Indeed I lo&s;t my ague &s;oon after I took it, but I am &s;ure it was owing to the crooked &s;ix-pence and not to the bark. And &s;o, good woman, you may come in if you will, for there is not a &s;oul in the hou&s;e but me." This was the very thing Rachel wanted to know.</P>
<P>While Sally was above &s;tairs untying her glove, Rachel &s;lipped into the parlour, took a &s;mall &s;ilver cup from the beau&s;et, and clapped it into her pocket. Sally ran down lamenting &s;he had lo&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="9">
her &s;ix-pence, which &s;he verily believed was owing to her having put it into a left glove, in&s;tead of a right one. Rachel comforted her by &s;aying, that if &s;he gave her two plain ones in&s;tead, the charm would work ju&s;t as well. Simple Sally thought her&s;elf happy to be let off &s;o ea&s;ily, never calculating that a &s;mooth &s;hilling was worth two crooked &s;ix-pences. But this &s;kill was a part of the black art in which Rachel excel|led. She took the money and began to ex|amine the lines of Sally's left hand. She bit her withered lip, &s;hook her head, and bade her poor dupe beware of a young man, who had black hair. "No indeed," cried Sally all in a fright, "you mean black eyes, for our Jacob has got brown hair, 'tis his eyes that are black." "That is the very thing I was going to &s;ay," muttered Rachel, "I meant eyes though I &s;aid hair, for I know his hair is as brown as a che&s;nut, and his eyes as black as a &s;loe." "So they are &s;ure enough," cried Sally, "how in the world could you know that?" forgetting that &s;he her&s;elf had ju&s;t told her &s;o. And it is thus that the&s;e hags pick out of the credulous all which they after|wards pretend to reveal to them. "O, I know a pretty deal more than that," &s;aid Rachel, but you mu&s;t be aware of this man. "Why &s;o," cried Sally with great quickne&s;s, "Becau&s;e," an&s;wered Rachel, "you are <HI>fated</HI> to marry a man worth a hundred of him who has blue eyes, light hair, and a &s;toop in the &s;houlders." "No, indeed, but I can't" &s;aid Sally, "I have promi&s;ed Jacob, and Jacob I will marry." "You cannot child," returned Rachel, in a &s;olemn tone; "it is out of your power, you are fated to marry the grey eyes and light hair." "Nay, indeed," &s;aid Sally, &s;ighing deeply, "if I
<PB N="11" REF="10">
am fated, I mu&s;t; I know there is no re&s;i&s;ting one's fate." This is a common cant with poor de|luded girls, who are not aware that they them|&s;elves make their fate by their folly, and then complain there is no re&s;i&s;ting it.&mdash;"What can I do?" &s;aid Sally. "I will tell you that too," &s;aid Rachel. "You mu&s;t take a walk next Sunday afternoon to the church-yard, and the fir&s;t man you meet in a blue coat, with a large po&s;y of pinks and futhernwood in his bo&s;om, &s;itting on the church-yard wall, about &s;even o'clock, he will be the man." "Provided," &s;aid Sally, much di&s;turbed, "that he has grey eyes, and &s;toops." "O, to be &s;ure," &s;aid Rachel, "otherwi&s;e it is not the right man." "But if I &s;hould mi&s;take," &s;aid Sally, "for two men may happen to have a coat and eyes of the &s;ame colour?" "To prevent that," replied Rachel, "if it is the right man, the two fir&s;t letters of his name will be R. P. This man has got money beyond &s;ea." "O, I do not value his money," &s;aid Sally, with tears in her eyes, "for I love Jacob better than hou&s;e or land; but if I am fated to marry another, I can't help it. You know there is no &s;truggling again&s;t my fate."</P>
<P>Poor Sally thought of nothing, and dreamt of no|thing all the week but the blue coat and the grey eyes. She made a hundred blunders at her work. She put her rennet into the butter-pan, in&s;tead of the chee&s;e-tub. She gave the curd to the hogs, and put the whey into the vats. She put her little knife out of her pocket for fear it &s;hould cut love, and would not &s;tay in the kitchen, if there was not an even number of people, le&s;t it &s;hould break the charm. She grew cold and my&s;terious in her behaviour to faithful Jacob, whom &s;he truly loved. But the more
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;he thought of the fortune-teller, the more &s;he was convinced that brown hair and black eyes were not what &s;he was fated to marry, and therefore though &s;he trembled to think it, Jacob could not be the man.</P>
<P>On Sunday &s;he was too unea&s;y to go to church; for poor Sally had never been taught that her be|ing unea&s;y was only a fre&s;h rea&s;on why &s;he ought to go thither. She &s;pent the whole afternoon in her little garret, dre&s;&s;ing in all her be&s;t. Fir&s;t &s;he put on her red ribbon, which &s;he had bought at la&s;t Lammas fair: then &s;he recollected that red was an unlucky colour, and changed it for a blue rib|bon, tied in a true lover's knot; but &s;uddenly calling to mind that poor Jacob had bought this knot for her of a pedlar at the door, and that &s;he had promi&s;ed to wear it for his &s;ake, her heart &s;mote her, and &s;he laid it by, &s;ighing to think &s;he was not fated to marry the man who had given it to her. When &s;he had looked at her&s;elf twenty times in the gla&s;s, for one vain action always brings on another, &s;he &s;et off, trembling and quaking every &s;tep &s;he went. She walked eagerly towards the church-yard, not daring to look to the right or left, for fear &s;he &s;hould &s;py Jacob, who would have offered to walk with her. As &s;oon as &s;he came within &s;ight of the wall, &s;he &s;pied a man &s;it|ting upon it. Her heart beat violently. She looked again; but alas! the &s;tranger not only had on a black coat, but neither hair nor eyes an&s;wered the de&s;cription. She happened to ca&s;t her eyes on the church-clock, and found &s;he was two hours before her time. This was &s;ome comfort. She walked away and got rid of the two hours as well as &s;he
<PB N="13" REF="12">
could, paying great attention as &s;he went not to walk over any &s;traws which lay acro&s;s. While the clock was &s;triking &s;even, &s;he returned to the church-yard, and, O! the wonderful power of for|tune-tellers! there &s;he &s;aw him! there &s;at the very man! his hair as light as flax, his eyes as blue as butter-milk, and his &s;houlders as round as a tub. Every tittle agreed, to the very no&s;egay in his wai&s;tcoat button-hole. At fir&s;t indeed &s;he thought it had been &s;weetbrier, and, glad to catch at a &s;traw, whi&s;pered to her&s;elf, it is not he, and I &s;hall marry Jacob &s;till; but on looking again, &s;he &s;aw it was &s;outhernwood plain enough, and that all was over. The man acco&s;ted her with &s;ome very non|&s;en&s;ical, but too acceptable compliments. Sally was naturally a mode&s;t girl, and but for Rachel's wicked arts, would not have talked with a &s;trange man; but how could &s;he re&s;i&s;t her fate you know? After a little di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he a&s;ked him, with a trem|bling heart, what might be his name? "Robert Price at your &s;ervice," was the an&s;wer. "Robert Price! that is R. P. as &s;ure as I am alive, and the fortune-teller was a witch! It is all out! it is all out! O the wonderful art of fortune-tellers!"</P>
<P>The little &s;leep &s;he had that night was di&s;turbed with dreams of graves, and gho&s;ts, and funerals; but as they were morning dreams, &s;he knew tho&s;e always went by contraries, and that a funeral de|noted a wedding. Still a &s;igh would now and then heave, to think that in that wedding Jacob could have no part. Such of my readers as know the power which &s;uper&s;tition has over the weak and cre|dulous mind, &s;carcely need be told, that poor Sal|ly's unhappine&s;s was &s;oon compleated. She forgot all her vows to Jacob; &s;he at once for&s;ook an hone&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="13">
man whom &s;he loved, and con&s;ented to marry one of whom &s;he knew nothing, from a ridiculous no|tion that &s;he was compelled to do &s;o by a decree which &s;he had it not in her power to re&s;i&s;t. She married this Richard Price, the &s;trange gardener, whom &s;he &s;oon found to be very worthle&s;s, and very much in debt. He had no &s;uch thing as "money beyond &s;ea," as the fortune-teller had told her; but he had another wife there. He got immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sally's 20<HI>l.</HI> Rachel put in for her &s;hare, but he refu&s;ed to give her a farthing, and bid her get away or he would have her taken up on the vagrant act. He &s;oon ran away from Sally, leaving her to bewail her own weakne&s;s; for it was that indeed, and not any irre&s;i&s;tible, fate which had been the cau&s;e of her ruin. To compleat her mi&s;ery, &s;he her&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected of having &s;tolen the &s;ilver cup which Ra|chel had pocketed. Her ma&s;ter, however, would not pro&s;ecute her, as &s;he was falling into a deep decline, and &s;he died in a few months of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Rachel, whenever &s;he got near home, u&s;ed to drop her trade of fortune-teller, and only dealt in the wares of her ba&s;ket. Mr. Wil&s;on, the clergyman, found her one day dealing out &s;ome very wicked ballads to &s;ome children. He went up with a view to give her a reprimand; but had no &s;ooner be|gun his exhortation than up came a con&s;table, fol|lowed by &s;everal people. "There &s;he is, that is &s;he, that is the old witch who tricked my wife out of the five guineas," &s;aid one of them. "Do your office con&s;table, &s;eize that old hag. She may tell fortunes and find pots of gold in Taunton goa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; for there &s;he will have nothing el&s;e to do ?" This was that very farmer Jenkins, who&s;e wife had
<PB N="15" REF="14">
been cheated by Rachel of the five guineas. He had taken pains to trace her to her own pari&s;h: he did not &s;o much value the lo&s;s of the money, but he thought it was a duty he owed the public to clear the country of &s;uch vermin. Mr. Wil&s;on imme|diately committed her. She took her trial at the next affizes, when &s;he was &s;entenced to a year's impri&s;onment. In the mean time the pawnbroker to whom &s;he had &s;old the cup, which &s;he had &s;tolen from poor Sally's ma&s;ter, impeached; and as the robbery was fully proved upon Rachel, &s;he was &s;entenced for this crime to Botany Bay; and a hap|py day it was for the county of Somer&s;et, when &s;uch a nui&s;ance was &s;ent out of it. She was tran&s;|ported much about the &s;ame time that her hu&s;band Giles lo&s;t his life in &s;tealing the net from the gar|den wall.</P>
<P>I have thought it my duty to print this little hi&s;|tory as a kind warning to all you young men and maid|ens not to have any thing to &s;ay TO CHEATS, IMPOS|TORS, CUNNING WOMEN, FORTUNE-TELLERS, CONJU|RERS, and INTERPRETERS OF DREAMS.&mdash;Li&s;ten to me, your true friend, when I a&s;&s;ure you that God never reveals to weak and wicked women tho&s;e &s;ecret de|&s;igns of his Providence, which no human wi&s;dom is able to fore&s;ee. To con&s;ult the&s;e fal&s;e oracles is not only fooli&s;h, but &s;inful.

Never believe that God con|ceals his will from a &s;ober Chri&s;tian who obeys his laws, and reveals it to a vagabond Cip&s;ey, who runs up and down breaking the laws, both of God and man. King Saul never con&s;ulted the witch till he had left off &s;erving God. The Bible will direct us what to do better then any conjurer, and no days are unlucky but tho&s;e which we make &s;o by our own vanity, folly, and &s;in.</P>
