<HEAD>DEDICATION TO THE REV. <HI>JOSEPH WARTON,</HI> D. D. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY PLEASANT AND RESPECTABLE FRIEND!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN prefixing your name to this volume, I feel and con|fe&s;s the double influence of an affectionate and of an ambitious de&s;ire to honour you and my&s;elf. Our lo&s;t and lamented Friend GIBBON has told us, I think very truly, in dedicating a juvenile work to his Father, that there are but two kinds of Dedications, which can do honour either to the Patron or the Author&mdash;the fir&s;t ari&s;ing from lite|rary e&s;teem, the &s;econd from per&s;onal affection. If either of the&s;e two characteri&s;tics may be &s;ufficient to give pro|priety to a Dedication, I have little to apprehend for the pre&s;ent, which has certainly the advantage of uniting the two.</P>
<P>The kind and friendly manner in which you com|mended the fir&s;t edition of this Life might alone have in|duced me to in&s;cribe a more ample copy of it to that li|terary
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
veteran, who&s;e applau&s;e is &s;o ju&s;tly dear to me. I have additional inducements in recollecting your animated and enlightened regard for the glory of MILTON. It is plea&s;ing to addre&s;s a &s;ympathetic friend on a &s;ubject that intere&s;ts the fancy and the heart. I remember, with peculiar gratification, the liberality and frankne&s;s, with which you lamented to me the extreme &s;everity of the late Mr. Warton, in de&s;cribing the controver&s;ial writings of Milton. I honour the rare integrity of your mind, my candid friend, which took the part of injured genius and probity again&s;t the prejudices of a brother, eminent as a &s;cholar, and entitled al&s;o, in many points of view, to your love and admiration. I &s;ympathize with you mo&s;t cordially in regretting the &s;everity to which I allude, &s;o little to be expected from the general temper of the cri|tic, and from that affectionate &s;pirit, with which he had vindicated the poetry of Milton from the mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions of cold and callous au&s;terity. But Mr. Warton had fallen into a mi&s;take, which has betrayed other well-di&s;po&s;ed minds into an unrea&s;onable abhorrence of Milton's pro&s;e; I mean the mi&s;take of regarding it as having a tendency to &s;ubvert our exi&s;ting government. Can any man ju&s;tly think it has &s;uch a tendency, who recollects that no government, &s;imilar to that which the Revolution e&s;tabli&s;hed for England, exi&s;ted when Milton wrote. His impa&s;&s;ioned yet di&s;intere&s;ted ardour for reformation was
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
excited by tho&s;e gro&s;s abu&s;es of power, which that new &s;ettlement of the &s;tate very happily corrected.</P>
<P>Your learned and good-natured brother, my dear friend, was not the only man of learning and good-nature, who indulged a prejudice, that to us appears very extra|vagant, to give it the gentle&s;t appellation. A literary Paladine (if I may borrow from romance a title of di&s;|tinction to honour a very powerful hi&s;torian) even Gibbon him&s;elf, whom we both admired and loved for his literary and for his &s;ocial accompli&s;hments, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, I think, on this topic, the &s;everity of Mr. Warton, and held it hardly compatible with the duty of a good citizen to re-publi&s;h, in the pre&s;ent times, the pro&s;e of Milton, as he appre|hended it might be productive of public evil. For my own part, although I &s;incerely re&s;pected the highly culti|vated mind that harboured this apprehen&s;ion, yet the apprehen&s;ion it&s;elf appeared to me &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the fear of Fal&s;taff, when he &s;ays, <Q>I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead.</Q> As the pro&s;e of Milton had a reference to the di&s;tracted period in which it aro&s;e, its arguments, if they could by any means be pointed again&s;t our exi&s;ting government, are &s;urely as incapable of inflicting a wound, as completely dead for all the purpo&s;es of ho&s;tility, as the noble Percy is repre|&s;ented, when he excites the ludicrous terror of Sir John: but while I pre&s;ume to de&s;cribe the pro&s;e of Milton as
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
inanimate in one point of view, let me have the ju&s;tice to add, that it frequently breathes &s;o warm a &s;pirit of genuine eloquence and philanthropy, that I am per&s;uaded the prophecy of its great author concerning it will be gradually accompli&s;hed; its defects and its merits will be more temperately and ju&s;tly e&s;timated in a future age than they have hitherto been. The prejudices &s;o recently entertained again&s;t it, by the two eminent writers I have mentioned, were entertained at a period when a very ex|traordinary panic po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and overclouded many of the mo&s;t elevated and enlightened minds of this kingdom&mdash; a period when a retired &s;tudent could hardly amu&s;e him|&s;elf with peru&s;ing the nervous republican writers of the la&s;t century, without being &s;u&s;pected of framing deadly machinations again&s;t the monarchs of the pre&s;ent day; and when the principles of a Jacobin were very blindly imputed to a truly Engli&s;h writer of acknowledged ge|nius, and of the pure&s;t reputation, who is, perhaps, of all men living, the mo&s;t perfectly blamele&s;s in his &s;entiments of government, morality, and religion. But, happily for the credit of our national under&s;tanding, and our national courage, the panic to which I allude has &s;peedily pa&s;&s;ed away, and a man of letters may now, I pre&s;ume, as &s;afely and irreproachably peru&s;e or reprint the great republican writers of England, as he might tran&s;late or elucidate the political vi&s;ions of Plato, a writer whom Milton pa&s;&s;ionately
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
admired, and to whom he bore, I think, in many points, a very &s;triking re&s;emblance. Perhaps they both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too large a portion of fancy and enthu&s;ia&s;m to make good practical &s;tate&s;men; the vi&s;ionaries of public virtue have &s;eldom &s;ucceeded in the management of dominion, and in politics it has long been a prevailing creed to believe, that goverment is like gold, and mu&s;t not be fa&s;hioned for ex|ten&s;ive u&s;e without the alloy of corruption. But I mean not to burthen you, my lively friend, with political reflec|tions, or with a long di&s;&s;ertation on the great ma&s;s of Milton's pro&s;e; you, who&s;e &s;tudies are &s;o various and ex|ten&s;ive, are &s;ufficiently familiar with tho&s;e &s;ingular com|po&s;itions; and I am not a little gratified in the a&s;&s;urance that you think as I do, both of their blemi&s;hes and their beauties, and approve the u&s;e that I have made of them in my endeavours to elucidate the life and character of their author. Much as we re&s;pected the cla&s;&s;ical erudi|tion and the ta&s;te of your lamented brother, I am confi|dent that we can neither of us &s;ub&s;cribe to the cen&s;ure he has pa&s;&s;ed on the Latin &s;tyle of Milton, who, to my ap|prehen&s;ion, is often mo&s;t admirably eloquent in that lan|guage, and particularly &s;o in the pa&s;&s;age I have cited from his character of Brad&s;haw; a character in which I have known very acrimonious enemies to the name of the man commended very candidly acknowledge the eloquence of the eulogi&s;t. Some rigorous idolaters of the unhappy race of Stuart may yet cen&s;ure me even for this di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate
<PB N="x" REF="8">
revival of &s;uch a character; but you, my liberal friend to the freedom of literary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, you will &s;ugge&s;t to me, that the minds of our countrymen in general a&s;pire to Roman magnanimity, in rendering ju&s;tice to great qualities in men, who were occa&s;ionally the objects of public de|te&s;tation, and you join with me in admiring that exam|ple of &s;uch magnanimity, to which I particularly allude. Nothing is more honourable to ancient Rome, than her ge|nero&s;ity in allowing a &s;tatue of Hannibal to be rai&s;ed and admired within the walls of the very city, which it was the ambition of his life to di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;troy.</P>
<P>In emulation of that &s;pirit, which delights to honour the excellencies of an illu&s;trious antagoni&s;t, I have endeavoured to pre&s;erve in my own mind, and to expre&s;s on every pro|per occa&s;ion, my un&s;haken regard for the rare faculties and virtues of a late extraordinary biographer, whom it has been my lot to encounter continually as a very bitter, and &s;ometimes, I think, an in&s;idious enemy to the great poet, who&s;e memory I have fervently wi&s;hed to re&s;cue from indignity and detraction. The a&s;perity of John&s;on to|wards Milton has often &s;truck the fond admirers of the poet in various points of view; in one moment it excites laughter, in another indignation; now it reminds us of the weapon of Goliah as de&s;cribed by Cowley;
<Q><L>A &s;word &s;o great, that it was only fit</L>
<L>To cut off his great head that came with it;</L></Q>
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
now it prompts us to exclaim, in the words of an an|gry Roman:
<Q><L>Nec bellua tetrior ulla e&s;t</L>
<L>Quam &s;ervi rabies in libera colla furentis.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have felt, I confe&s;s, the&s;e different emotions of re|&s;entment in peru&s;ing the various &s;arca&s;ms of the au&s;tere critic again&s;t the object of my poetical idolatry, but I have tried, and I hope with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, to correct the animo&s;ity they mu&s;t naturally excite, by turning to the more temperate works of that very copious and admir|able writer, particularly to his exqui&s;ite paper in the Rambler (N^o 54) on the deaths and a&s;perity of literary men. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible, I think, to read the paper I have mentioned without lo&s;ing, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, all &s;en&s;ations of di&s;plea&s;ure towards the eloquent, the tender morali&s;t, and reflecting, with a &s;ort of friendly &s;atisfaction, that, as long as the language of England exi&s;ts, the name of JOHNSON will remain, and de&s;erve to remain,
<Q>Magnum et memorabile nomen.</Q></P>
<P>As long as eloquence and morality are objects of pub|lic regard, we mu&s;t revere that great mental phy&s;ician, who has given to us all, infirm mortals as the be&s;t of us are, &s;uch admirable pre&s;criptions for the regimen of mind, and we &s;hould rather &s;peak in &s;orrow than in anger, when we are forced to recollect, that, like other phy&s;icians,
<PB N="xii" REF="10">
however able and perfect in theory, he failed to correct the infirmity of his own morbid &s;pirit. You, my dear Warton, whom an oppo&s;ite temperament has made a critic of a more airy and cheerful complection, you are one of the be&s;t witne&s;&s;es that I could po&s;&s;ibly produce, if I had any occa&s;ion to prove that my ideas of John&s;on's malevolent prejudices again&s;t Milton are not the offsprings of a fancy equally prejudiced it&s;elf again&s;t the great au|thor, who&s;e prejudices I have pre&s;umed to oppo&s;e; you, my dear friend, have heard the har&s;h critic advance in conver&s;ation an opinion again&s;t Milton, even more &s;evere than the many detractive &s;arca&s;ms with which his life of the great poet abounds; you have heard him declaim again&s;t the admiration excited by the poetry of Milton, and affirm it to be nothing more than the cant (to u&s;e his own favourite phra&s;e) of affected &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>I have pre&s;umed to &s;ay, that John&s;on &s;ometimes ap|pears as an in&s;idious enemy to the poet. Is there not &s;ome degree of in&s;idious ho&s;tility in his introducing into his dictionary, under the article Sonnet, the very &s;onnet of Milton, which an enemy would certainly chu&s;e, who wi&s;hed to repre&s;ent Milton as a writer of ver&s;es entitled to &s;corn and deri&s;ion? You will immediately recollect that I allude to the &s;onnet which begins thus:
<Q>A book was writ of late called Tetrachordon.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="11">The &s;onnet is, in truth, contemptible enough, if we &s;uppo&s;e that Milton intended it as a &s;erious compo&s;ition; but I apprehend it was an idle <HI>lu&s;us poeticus,</HI> and either meant as a ludicrous parody on &s;ome other &s;onnet, which has &s;unk into oblivion, or merely written as a trifling pa&s;time, to &s;hew that it is po&s;&s;ible to compo&s;e a &s;onnet with words mo&s;t unfriendly to rhyme. However this may be, it was barbarous &s;urely towards Milton (and, I might add, towards the poetry of England) to exhibit this un|happy little production, in &s;o con&s;picuous a manner, as a &s;pecimen of Engli&s;h &s;onnets. Yet I perceive it is po&s;&s;ible to give a milder interpretation of John&s;on's de&s;ign in his di&s;play of this unfortunate &s;onnet; and as I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h not to charge him with more malevolence towards Milton than he really exerted, I will ob&s;erve on this oc|ca&s;ion, that as he had little, or rather no reli&s;h for &s;onnets, which the &s;tern logician &s;eems to have de&s;pi&s;ed as per|plexing trifles <HI>(difficiles nugae)</HI> he might only mean to deter young poetical &s;tudents from a kind of ver&s;e that he di&s;liked, by leading them to remark, how the greate&s;t of our poets had failed in this petty compo&s;ition. You, who perfectly know how much more inclined I am to prai&s;e than to cen&s;ure, will give me full credit for my &s;incerity in &s;aying, that I wi&s;h to acquit John&s;on of male|volence in every article where my rea&s;on will allow me to do &s;o. I have been under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
di&s;playing continually, in the following work, the various examples of his &s;everity to Milton. Nothing is more apt to excite our &s;pleen than a &s;troke of inju&s;tice again&s;t an author whom we love and revere; but I &s;hould be &s;orry to find my&s;elf infected by the acrimony which I was obliged to di&s;play, and I &s;hould be equally &s;orry to run into an oppo&s;ite failing, and to indulge a &s;pirit of obloquy, like Mrs. Candour, in the School for Scandal, with all the grimaces of affected good nature. I have, &s;poken, therefore my own feelings, without bitterne&s;s and without timidity. I cannot &s;ay that I &s;peak of John&s;on <Q>&s;ine ira et &s;tudio,</Q> as Tacitus &s;aid of other great men (very differently great!) for, in truth, I feel towards the &s;ame object tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite &s;ources of prejudice and partia|lity: as a critical biographer of the poets he often excites my tran&s;ient indignation; but as an eloquent teacher of morality he fills me with more la&s;ting reverence and affection.</P>
<P>His lives of the poets will probably give birth, in this or the next century, to a work of literary retaliation. Whenever a poet ari&s;es with as large a portion of &s;pleen towards the critical writers of pa&s;t ages, as John&s;on in|dulged towards the poets in his poetical biography, the literature of England will be enriched with "the Lives of the Critics," a work from which you, my dear Warton, will have little to apprehend; you, who&s;e e&s;&s;ay teaches, as
<PB N="xv" REF="13">
the critical biographer very truly and liberally ob&s;erved, <Q>how the brow of critici&s;m may be &s;moothed, and how &s;he may be enabled, with all her &s;everity, to attract and delight.</Q></P>
<P>Yet to &s;hew how apt a writer of ver&s;es is to accu&s;e a profe&s;t critic of &s;everity, we may both recollect, that when I had occa&s;ion to &s;peak of your entertaining and in&s;truc|tive E&s;&s;ay on Pope, I &s;crupled not to con&s;ider the main &s;cope of it a little too &s;evere; and in truth, my dear friend, I think &s;o &s;till; becau&s;e it is the aim of that charming E&s;&s;ay to prove, that Pope po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not tho&s;e very high poetical talents, for which the world, though &s;ufficiently inclined to di&s;cover and magnify his defects, had allowed him credit. You con&s;ider him as the poet of rea&s;on, and intimate that "he &s;tooped to truth, and moralized his &s;ong," from a want of native powers to &s;upport a long flight in the higher province of fancy. To me, I confe&s;s, his Rape of the Lock appears a &s;ufficient proof that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a &s;u|perlative degree, the faculty in which you would reduce him to a &s;econdary rank; he cho&s;e, indeed, in many of his productions, to be the poet of rea&s;on rather than of fancy; but I apprehend his choice was influenced by an idea (I believe a mi&s;taken idea) that moral &s;atire is the &s;pecies of poetry by which a poet of modern times may render the greate&s;t &s;ervice to mankind. But if in one article you have been not &s;o kind, as I could wi&s;h, to the
<PB N="xvi" REF="14">
poet of morality, I rejoice in recollecting, that you are on the point of making him con&s;iderable amends, and of ful|filling a prediction of mine, by removing from the pages of Pope a great portion of the lumber with which they were amply loaded by Warburton. You will &s;oon, I tru&s;t, prove to the literary world, as you perfectly proved to me &s;ome years ago, that the poet has &s;uffered not a little from the ab&s;urdities of his arrogant annotator. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible for a man of letters, who affectionately venerates the name of Milton, and recollects &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of Warburton concerning his poetry and his moral character, to &s;peak of that &s;upercilious prelate without catching &s;ome portion of his own &s;cornful &s;pirit: you will immediately perceive that I allude to his having be&s;towed upon Milton the opprobrious title of a time-&s;erver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With what peculiar propriety Warburton applied this name to Mil|ton, the reader will be&s;t judge, who re|collects the humorous Butler's very admirable character of a time-&s;erver, which contains the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age: <Q>He is very zealous to &s;hew him&s;elf, upon all occa&s;ions, a true member of the church for the time being, and has not the lea&s;t &s;cruple in his con|&s;cience again&s;t the doctrine and di&s;|cipline of it, as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent, or &s;hall do hereafter, un&s;ight un|&s;een; for he is re&s;olved to be al|ways for the truth, which he be|lieves is never &s;o plainly demon|&s;trated as in that character that &s;ays <HI>'it is great, and prevails;'</HI> and in that &s;en&s;e only fit to be adhered to by a prudent man, who will never be kinder to truth than &s;he is to him; for &s;uffering is a very <HI>evil effect,</HI> and not likely to proceed from a <HI>good cau&s;e.</HI> <BIBL>Butler's Remains, vol. ii. p. 220.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Do you recol|lect, my dear learned critic, exten&s;ive as your &s;tudies have
<PB N="xvii" REF="15">
been; do you recollect, in the wide range of ancient and modern defamation, a more unpardonable abu&s;e of lan|guage? Milton, a poet of the mo&s;t powerful, and, per|haps, the mo&s;t independent mind that was ever given to a mere mortal, in&s;ulted with the appellation of a time-&s;erver; and by whom? by Warburton, who&s;e writings, and who&s;e fortune&mdash;but I will not copy the contemptuous prelate in his favourite exerci&s;e of reviling the literary characters, who&s;e opinions were different from his own; his habit of indulging a contemptuous and dogmatical &s;pirit has already drawn upon his name and writings the natural puni&s;hment of &s;uch verbal intemperance; and the mitred follower of his fame and fortune, who has lately endea|voured to prop his reputation by a tenderly partial, but a very imperfect life of his precipitate and quarrel&s;ome pa|tron, has rather le&s;&s;ened, perhaps, his own credit, than increa&s;ed that of his ma&s;ter, by that affected coldne&s;s of contempt with which he de&s;cribes, or rather disfigures, the illu&s;trious cha&s;ti&s;er of Warburtonian in&s;olence, the more accompli&s;hed critic, of whom you eminent &s;cholars of Winton are very ju&s;tly proud; I mean the eloquent and graceful LOWTII.</P>
<P>But as I am not fond of literary &s;trife, however digni|fied and di&s;tingui&s;hed the antagoni&s;ts may be, I will ha&s;ten to extricate my&s;elf from this little group of contentious critics; for it mu&s;t be matter of regret to every &s;incere
<PB N="xviii" REF="16">
votary of peace and benevolence to ob&s;erve, that the field of literature is too frequently a field of cruelty, which al|mo&s;t realizes the hyperbolical expre&s;&s;ion of Lucan, and exhibits
<Q>Plu&s;quam civilia bella;</Q>
where men, who&s;e kindred &s;tudies &s;hould humanize their temper, and unite them in the ties of fraternal regard, are too apt to exert all their faculties in ferociou&s;ly mangling each other; where we &s;ometimes behold the friend&s;hip of years di&s;&s;olved in a moment, and converted into furious ho&s;tility, which, though it does not endanger, yet never fails to embitter life; and perhaps the &s;ource of &s;uch con|tention,
<Q><L>teterrima belli</L>
<L>Cau&s;a&mdash;</L></Q>
in&s;tead of being a fair and faithle&s;s Helen, is nothing more than a particle of grammar in a dead language. O that the &s;pleen-correcting powers of mild and friendly ridicule could annihilate &s;uch ho&s;tilities!&mdash;Cannot you, my dear Warton, who have the weight and authority of a pacific Ne&s;tor in this tumultuous field, cannot you &s;ugge&s;t effec|tual lenitives for the <HI>genus irritabile &s;criptorum.</HI> The celebrated Saxon painter Mengs has, I think, given us all an admirable him of this kind in writing to an ingenious but petulant Frenchman, who had provoked him by
<PB N="xix" REF="17">
&s;peaking contemptuou&s;ly of his learned and enthu&s;ia&s;tic friend Winkelman.

<P>The&s;e admonitions are excellent, and want only the good example of the monitor to make them complete; but Mengs, unfortunately, in his profe&s;&s;ional writings, has &s;poken of Reynolds in a manner that gro&s;sly violates his own doctrine; &s;o difficult is it, my good Doctor, to find a pacific preacher and his practice in perfect harmony with each other.</P>
<P>To feeling and fervent &s;pirits there can hardly be any provocation more apt to excite a&s;perity of language, than an in&s;ult offered to an object of their e&s;teem and venera|tion. In writing upon Milton, and tho&s;e who, to my apprehen&s;ion, have in&s;ulted his name with contumelious &s;everity, I may have been hurried beyond the bias of my
<PB N="xx" REF="18">
temper, which is, I tru&s;t, neither ira&s;cible nor cen&s;ori|ous; but I will imitate &s;ome well meaning catholic wri|ters, and making you, my dear Warton, my inqui&s;itor as well as my patron, I will here very hone&s;tly &s;ay to you, <Q><HI>Si quid dixerim contra &s;piritum caritatis evan|gelicae indictum volo.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Let me now ha&s;ten to apologize to you, as I think I ought, for &s;uch deficiencies as your nice di&s;cernment can|not fail to ob&s;erve in the work I addre&s;s to you. You remember that Plutarch, the amiable prince of ancient biographers, has very ju&s;tly mentioned the advantage ari&s;ing to a writer from re&s;iding in a city amply furni&s;h|ed with books;&mdash;it is my lot, you know, to live in a little &s;eque&s;tered village, and I chu&s;e to do &s;o for the rea&s;on which attached the good-natured Plutarch to his native Cheronaea, that it may not become le&s;s. Had it &s;uited me to devote much time and labour to exten&s;ive re&s;earches in the public and private libraries of London, it is po&s;&s;ible that I might have di&s;covered &s;ome latent anecdotes relat|ing to Milton; yet after the patient inquiries of the in|telligent and indefatigable Dr. Birch, and after the &s;ignal di&s;covery of your more &s;ucce&s;sful brother, little novelty could be expected to reward the toil of &s;uch inve&s;tigation; and perhaps a writer too eager to make new di&s;coveries on this beaten ground, might be hurried by &s;uch eagerne&s;s into the cen&s;urable temerity of Peek the antiquarian, who,
<PB N="xxi" REF="19">
in his memoirs of the great poet, has affixed the name of Milton to a portrait and a poem that do not belong to him.</P>
<P>Though my work has been executed in a retired village of England, my enquiries have extended far beyond the limits of our own country, by the aid of &s;ome intelligent and obliging friends, who had the kindne&s;s to &s;earch for me the great libraries of Paris and Rome, in the hope of di&s;covering &s;ome neglected compo&s;ition, or latent anec|dote, that might be u&s;eful to a biographer of Milton. The &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e re&s;earches has not been equal to the kindne&s;s and the zeal of the intelligent enquirers; but an unexpected favour from a literary friend, who is known to me only by his writings, has enabled me to throw, perhaps, a new ray of light on that inviting &s;ub|ject of conjecture, the real origin of Milton's greate&s;t performance.</P>
<P>In the di&s;&s;ertation, which I have annexed to this life of the poet, you will find &s;ome account of an Italian dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m on the inhabitants of Paradi&s;e, which, though it ri&s;es not to the poetical &s;pirit of Andreini, may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;ome influence, I apprehend, on the fancy of Milton. You will al&s;o find, that I have followed your example, in recommending your old acquaintance Andreini <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the no|tice of the public. He happened to engage my atten|tion, when the health of my revered friend, Mr. Cowper,
<PB N="xxii" REF="20">
allowed him to be my gue&s;t; and, after our more &s;erious morning &s;tudies, it afforded us a plea&s;ant relaxation and amu&s;ement to throw &s;ome parts of the <HI>Adamo</HI> into Engli&s;h, in a rapid yet metrical tran&s;lation. In this joint work, or rather pa&s;time, it would be needle&s;s, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;tingui&s;h the lines of the united tran&s;lators, as the ver&s;ion had no higher aim than to gratify the cu|rio&s;ity of the Engli&s;h reader, without a&s;piring to prai&s;e. A very different character is due to that ver&s;ion of Mil|ton's Latin poetry, which my excellent friend has fini&s;h|ed with &s;uch care and felicity, that even from the &s;eparate &s;pecimens of it, with which this life is embelli&s;hed, you, my dear Warton, and every delicate judge of poetry, will, I am confident, e&s;teem it an ab&s;olute model of poetical tran&s;lation. For the honour of Milton, and for that of his mo&s;t worthy interpreter, I hope that the whole of this admirable performance may be &s;oon imparted to the public, as I tru&s;t that returning health will happily re&s;tore its incomparable author to his &s;u&s;pended &s;tudies; an event that may affect the moral intere&s;t and the men|tal delight of all the world&mdash;for rarely, very rarely indeed, has heaven be&s;towed on any individual &s;uch an ample, &s;uch a variegated portion of true poetical genius, and never did it add greater purity of heart to that divine yet perilous talent, to guide and &s;anctify its exertion. Tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the writings and the virtues of my
<PB N="xxiii" REF="21">
ine&s;timable friend, mu&s;t be mo&s;t fervent in their hopes, that in the cour&s;e and the clo&s;e of his poetical career he may re&s;emble his great and favourite predece&s;&s;ors, Homer and Milton; their &s;pirits were cheered and illuminated in the decline of life by a fre&s;h portion of poetical power; and if in their latter productions they ro&s;e not to the full force and &s;plendor of their meridian glory, they yet enchanted mankind with the &s;weetne&s;s and &s;erenity of their de&s;cending light.</P>
<P>Literature, which Cicero has &s;o eloquently de&s;cribed as the friend of every period and condition of human exi&s;tence, is peculiarly the friend of age; a truth of which you, my dear Warton, are a very lively illu&s;tra|tion&mdash;you, who at a &s;ea&s;on of life when unlettered mor|tals generally murmur again&s;t the world, are mini&s;tering to its in&s;truction and its plea&s;ure by continuing to write with temper, vivacity, and grace.</P>
<P>That you may long retain and di&s;play this happy a&s;|&s;emblage of endowments, &s;o rare in a critical veteran, is the cordial wi&s;h of many, and particularly the wi&s;h of your very &s;incere and affectionate friend,</P>

<P>THE character of MILTON has been &s;crutinized with all the minutene&s;s of inve&s;tigation, which oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions could &s;ugge&s;t. The virulent antagoni&s;t and the enraptured idolater have pur&s;ued his &s;teps with equal perti|nacity: nor have we wanted men of learning and virtue, who, devoid of prejudice and enthu&s;ia&s;m, both in politics and in poetry, have endeavoured to weigh his merits ex|actly in the balance of truth and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>What new light then can be thrown upon a life, who&s;e incidents have been &s;o eagerly collected, and &s;o frequently retailed? What novelty of remark can be expected in a review of poems, who&s;e beauties and blemi&s;hes have been elaborately examined in critical di&s;&s;ertations, that almo&s;t rival in excellence the poetry they di&s;cu&s;s? A&s;&s;uredly but little; yet there remains, perhaps, one method of giving a
<PB N="2" REF="23">
degree of intere&s;t and illu&s;tration to the life of Milton, which it has not hitherto received; a method which his accompli&s;hed friend of Italy, the Marquis of Villa, in &s;ome mea&s;ure adopted in his intere&s;ting life of Ta&s;&s;o; and which two engaging biographers of later date, the Abb&eacute; de Sade and Mr. Ma&s;on, have carried to greater perfection in their re&s;pective memoirs of Petrarch and of Gray. By weaving into their narrative &s;elections of ver&s;e and pro&s;e from the various writings of tho&s;e they wi&s;hed to commemorate, each of the&s;e affectionate memoriali&s;ts may be &s;aid to have taught the poet he loved "to become his own biographer;" an experiment that may, perhaps, be tried on Milton with the happie&s;t effect! as in his works, and particularly in tho&s;e that are at pre&s;ent the lead known, he has &s;poken frequently of him&s;elf.&mdash;Not from vanity, a failing too cold and low for his ardent and elevated mind; but, in advanced life, from motives of ju&s;tice and honour, to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the poi&s;oned arrows of &s;lander; and, in his younger days, from that tenderne&s;s and &s;implicity of heart, which lead a youth|ful poet to make his own affections and amu&s;ements the chief &s;ubjects of his &s;ong.</P>
<P>The great aim of the &s;ub&s;equent account is to render full and perfect ju&s;tice to the general character of Milton. His manners and ca&s;t of mind, in various periods of life, may appear in a new and agreeable light, from the following col|lection and arrangement of the many little &s;ketches, which his own hand has occa&s;ionally given us, of his pa&s;&s;ions and pur&s;uits. Several of the&s;e, indeed, have been fondly a&s;&s;em|bled by Toland or Richard&s;on; men, who, different as they
<PB N="3" REF="24">
were in their general &s;entiments and principles, yet &s;ympathized completely in their zeal for the renown of Milton; delight|ing to dwell on his character with <Q>that &s;hadow of friend|&s;hip, that complacency and ardour of attachment, which, as Pope has ob&s;erved in &s;peaking of Homer, we naturally feel for the great geniu&s;es of former time.</Q>&mdash;But tho&s;e who have endeavoured to illu&s;trate the per&s;onal hi&s;tory of the great Engli&s;h Author, by exhibiting pa&s;&s;ages from &s;ome of his neglected works, have almo&s;t confined them&s;elves to &s;elections from his pro&s;e.</P>
<P>There is an ampler field for the &s;tudy of his early temper and turn of mind in his Latin and Italian Poetry: here the heart and &s;pirit of Milton are di&s;played with all the frank|ne&s;s of youth. I &s;elect what has a peculiar tendency to &s;hew, in the cleare&s;t light, his native di&s;po&s;ition, becau&s;e his charac|ter as a man appears to have been greatly mi&s;taken. I am under no fear that the frequency or length of &s;uch citations may be expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure, having the plea&s;ure and advantage of pre|&s;enting them to the Engli&s;h reader in the elegant and &s;pirited ver&s;ion of a poet and a friend&mdash;with pride and delight I add the name of Cowper. This gentleman, who is prepared to oblige the world with a complete tran&s;lation of Milton's Latin and Italian poetry, has kindly favoured me with the liberty of tran&s;cribing, from his admirable work, whatever I wi&s;h to in&s;ert in this narrative. Since I am indebted to Milton for a friend&s;hip, which I regard as honourable in the highe&s;t degree, may I be indulged in the hope of leaving a la&s;ting memorial of it in the&s;e pages.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="25">A book, devoted to the honour of Milton, may admit, I hope, without impropriety, the prai&s;es due to a living author, who is become his poetical interpreter; an office which the &s;pirit of the divine bard may be gratified in his having a&s;&s;umed; for, a&s;&s;uredly, my friend bears no common re&s;emblance to his mo&s;t illu&s;trious predece&s;&s;or, not only in the energy and hallowed u&s;e of poetical talents, but in that beneficent fervour and purity of heart, which entitle the great poet to as large a portion of affectionate e&s;teem, as he has long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of admiration.</P>
<P>JOHN MILTON was born in London, on the 9th of December, 1608, at the hou&s;e of his father, in Bread-&s;treet, and baptized on the 20th of the &s;ame month. His chri&s;tian name de&s;cended to him from his grandfather. The family, once opulent proprietors of Milton, in Oxford&s;hire, lo&s;t that e&s;tate in the civil wars of York and Lanca&s;ter, and was in|debted, perhaps, to adver&s;ity for much higher di&s;tinction than opulence can be&s;tow. John, the grandfather of the poet, became deputy ranger in the fore&s;t of Shotover, not far from Oxford; and intending to educate his &s;on as a gen|tleman, he placed him at Chri&s;t-Church, in that univer&s;ity; but being him&s;elf a rigid Papi&s;t, he di&s;inherited the young and devout &s;cholar, for an attachment to the doctrines of the Reformation, and reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of quitting the path of literature for a le&s;s honourable but more lucra|tive profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The di&s;carded &s;tudent applied him&s;elf to the employment of a &s;crivener, which has varied with the variations of life and
<PB N="5" REF="26">
manners. A &s;crivener, in remoter ages, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a mere tran&s;criber; but at the period we &s;peak of, his occupation united the two profitable branches of drawing contracts and of lending money. The emoluments of this profe&s;&s;ion enabled the father of Milton to be&s;tow mo&s;t abund|antly on his &s;on tho&s;e advantages of education, which had been cruelly withdrawn from him&s;elf. The poet was happy in both his parents; and to the merits of both he has borne affectionate and honourable te&s;timony. The maiden name of his mother has been di&s;puted; but it &s;eems rea&s;onable to credit the account of Philips, her grand&s;on, the earlie&s;t bio|grapher of Milton, who had the advantage of living with him as a relation and a di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>Her name, according to this author, who &s;peaks highly of her virtue, was Ca&s;ton, and her family derived from Wales. Milton, in mentioning his own origin, with a decent pride, in reply to one of his revilers, a&s;&s;erts, that his mother was a woman of exemplary character, and peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed by her exten&s;ive charity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Londini &s;um natus, genere hone&s;to, patre viro integerrimo, matre probati&s;&s;im&agrave;, et eleemo|&s;ynis per viciniam poti&s;&s;imum no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a. <HI>Defen&s;io &s;ecund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE>. The parental kindne&s;s and the talents of his father he has celebrated in a Latin poem, which cannot be too warmly admired, as a monument of filial ten|derne&s;s, and poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m. It is probable, that the &s;evere manner in which that indulgent father had been driven from the pur&s;uits of learning induced him to exert uncommon liberality and ardour in the education of his &s;on. Though immer&s;ed him&s;elf in a lucrative occupation, he &s;eems to have retained great elegance of mind, and to have
<PB N="6" REF="27">
amu&s;ed him&s;elf with literature and mu&s;ic; to the latter he applied &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that, according to Dr. Burney, the accompli&s;hed hi&s;torian of that captivating art, "he became a voluminous compo&s;er, equal in &s;cience, if not in genius, to the be&s;t mu&s;icians of his age." Nor did his talents pa&s;s without celebrity or reward. Philips relates, that for one of his devotional compo&s;itions in forty parts, he was honoured with a gold chain and medal by a Poli&s;h prince, to whom he pre&s;ented it. This mark of di&s;tinction was frequently conferred on men, who ro&s;e to great excellence in different arts and &s;ciences: perhaps the ambition of young Milton was fir&s;t awakened by the&s;e gifts of honour be&s;towed upon his father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The father of Milton has been lately mentioned as an author.&mdash;He was thought to have publi&s;hed, in the year of the poet's birth, a little book, with the quaint title of "A Sixe Fold Politician."&mdash;Mr. Warton ob|&s;erved, that the curious publication a&s;cribed to Milton's father may be found in the Bodleian library; that "it appears to be a &s;atire on cha|racters pretending to wi&s;dom or policy, and is not void of learning and wit, &s;uch as we often find affectedly and awkwardly blended in the e&s;&s;ay-writers of that age."</P><P>By the favour of Mr. I&s;aac Reed, who is mo&s;t liberal in the communication of the literary rarities he has collected, I have pe|ru&s;ed this &s;ingular performance, and perfectly agree with its obliging po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and his ac|compli&s;hed friend, Dr. Farmer, that&punc; although in the records of the Stationers Company it is a&s;cribed to John Milton, we may rather a&s;&s;ign it to John Melton, author of the A&s;trolo|ga&s;ter, than to the father of our poet.&mdash;The latter will lo&s;e but little in being no longer regarded as its author, e&s;pecially as we have different and more honourable proofs of his attachment to literature.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A parent, who could enliven the drudgery of a dull pro|fe&s;&s;ion by a variety of elegant pur&s;uits, mu&s;t have been happy to di&s;cern, and eager to cheri&s;h, the fir&s;t dawning of genius in his child. In this point of view we may contemplate with peculiar delight the infantine portrait of Milton, by that elegant and faithful arti&s;t, Cornelius Jan&s;en. Aubrey, the antiquarian, ob&s;erving in his manu&s;cript memoirs of our
<PB N="7" REF="28">
author, that he was ten years old when this picture was drawn, affirms that "he was then a poet." This expre&s;&s;ion may lead us to imagine, that the portrait was executed to encourage the infant author; and if &s;o, it might operate as a powerful incentive to his future exertion. The permanent bias of an active &s;pirit often originates in the petty incidents of childhood; and as no human mind ever glowed with a more inten&s;e, or with a purer flame of literary ambition, than the mind of Milton, it may not be unplea&s;ing to conjecture how it fir&s;t caught the &s;parks, that gradually mounted to a blaze of unrivalled vehemence and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>His education, as Dr. Newton has well ob&s;erved, united the oppo&s;ite advantages of private and public in&s;truction. Of his early pa&s;&s;ion for letters he has left the following record, in his &s;econd defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pater me puerulum humaniarum litera|rum &s;tudiis de&s;tinavit; quas ita avide arri|pui, ut ab anno aetatis duodecimo vix unquam ante mediam noctem a lucubrationibus cubi|tum di&s;cederem; quae prima oculorum perni|cies &s;uit, quorum ad naturalem debilitatem acce&s;terant et crebri capitis dolores; quae omnia cum di&s;cendi impetum non retardarent, et in ludo literario, et &s;ub aliis domi magi&s;tris erudiendum quotidie curavit.</NOTE>: "My father de&s;tined me from my infancy to the &s;tudy of polite literature, which I embraced with &s;uch avidity, that from the age of twelve, I hardly ever retired from my books before midnight. This proved the fir&s;t &s;ource of injury to my eyes, who&s;e natural weakne&s;s was attended with frequent pains of the head; but as all the&s;e di&s;advantages could not repre&s;s my ardour for learn|ing, my father took care to have me in&s;tructed by various preceptors both at home and at &s;chool." His dome&s;tic tutor was Thomas Young, of E&s;&s;ex, who, being obliged to quit his country on account of religious opinions, became mini&s;ter
<PB N="8" REF="29">
to the Engli&s;h merchants at Hamburgh. It was probably from this learned and con&s;cientious man, that Milton caught not only his pa&s;&s;ion for literature, but that &s;teadine&s;s and unconquerable integrity of character, by which he was di&s;|tingui&s;hed through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of a tempe&s;tuous life. His reverential gratitude and affection towards this preceptor are recorded in two Latin epi&s;tles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The high opinion, which Milton enter|tertained of his preceptor, is &s;o gracefully ex|pre&s;&s;ed in one of the&s;e letters, that I &s;elect it as a &s;pecimen of his epi&s;tolary &s;tyle in the early period of life.</P><P>Thomae Junio.</P><P>In&s;pectis literis tuis (preceptor optime) unicum hoc mihi &s;upervacaneum occurrebat, quod tardae &s;criptionis excu&s;ationem attuleris; tamet&s;i enim literis tuis nihil mihi queat optabilius accedere, qui po&s;&s;im tamen aut debeam &s;perare otii tibi tantum &agrave; rebus &s;eriis, et &s;anctioribus e&s;&s;e, ut mihi &s;emper re&s;pondere vacet; prae&s;ertim cum illud humanitatis om|nino fit, officii minime.

<P>The reader, inclined to &s;ymphati&s;e in the joys of Mil|ton, will be gratified in being informed, that his preceptor, who&s;e exile and poverty he pathetically lamented, and who&s;e pro&s;perous return he predicted, was in a few years re&s;tored
<PB N="12" REF="33">
to his country, and became Ma&s;ter of Je&s;us College, in Cambridge.</P>
<P>As the year in which he quitted England (1623) cor|re&s;ponds with the fifteenth year of his pupil's age, it is pro|bable that Milton was placed, at that time, under the care of Mr. Gill and his &s;on; the former, chief ma&s;ter of St. Paul's &s;chool, the latter, his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and afterwards his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. It is remarkable, that Milton, who has been &s;o uncandidly repre&s;ented as an uncontroulable &s;pirit, and a &s;purner of all ju&s;t authority, &s;eems to have contracted a ten|der attachment to more than one di&s;ciplinarian concerned in his education. He is &s;aid to have been the favourite &s;cholar of the younger Gill; and he has left traces of their friend&s;hip in three Latin epi&s;tles, that expre&s;s the highe&s;t e&s;teem for the literary character and poetical talents of his in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>On the 12th of February, 1624, he was entered, not as as a &s;izar, which &s;ome of his biographers have erroneou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, but as a pen&s;ioner of Chri&s;t's College, in Cam|bridge. "At this time," &s;ays Doctor John&s;on, <Q>he was eminently &s;killed in the Latin tongue, and he him&s;elf, by annexing the dates to his fir&s;t compo&s;itions, a boa&s;t of which the learned Politian had given him an example, &s;eems to commend the carline&s;s of his own proficiency to the notice of po&s;terity; but the products of his vernal fertility have been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by many, and particularly by his contemporary, Cowley. Of the powers of the mind it is difficult to form an e&s;timate; many have excelled Milton in their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays, who never ro&s;e to works like Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="34">This is the fir&s;t of many remarks, replete with detraction, in which an illu&s;trious author has indulged his &s;pleen again&s;t Milton, in a life of the poet, where an ill-&s;ubdued propen|&s;ity to cen&s;ure is ever combating with a nece&s;&s;ity to com|mend. The parti&s;ans of the powerful critic, from a natu|ral partiality to their departed ma&s;ter, affect to con&s;ider his malignity as exi&s;ting only in the prejudices of tho&s;e who endeavour to counteract his inju&s;tice. A biographer of Milton ought therefore to regard it as his indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to &s;how how far this malignity is diffu&s;ed through a long &s;eries of ob&s;ervations, which affect the reputation both of the poet and the man; a duty that mu&s;t be painful in proportion to the &s;incerity of our e&s;teem for literary genius; &s;ince, different as they were in their principles, their man|ners, and their writings, both the poet and his critical biographer are a&s;&s;uredly entitled to the prai&s;e of exalted ge|nius. Perhaps in the republic of letters there never exi&s;ted two writers more de&s;ervedly di&s;tingui&s;hed, not only for the energy of their mental faculties, but for a generous and devout de&s;ire to benefit mankind by their exertion.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be lamented, and by the lovers of Milton in particular, that a morali&s;t, who has given us, in the Rambler, &s;uch &s;ublime le&s;&s;ons for the di&s;cipline of the heart and mind, &s;hould be unable to pre&s;erve his own from that acrimonious &s;pirit of detraction, which led him to depreciate, to the utmo&s;t of his power, the rare abilities, and perhaps the &s;till rarer integrity, of Milton. It may be &s;aid, that the truly eloquent and &s;plendid encomium, which he has be&s;towed on the great work of the poet, ought to exempt
<PB N="14" REF="35">
him from &s;uch a charge. The &s;ingular beauties and effect of this eulogy &s;hall be mentioned in the proper place, and with all the applau&s;e they merit; but here it is ju&s;t to re|collect, that the prai&s;e of the encomia&s;t is nearly confined to the &s;entence he pa&s;&s;es as a critic; his more diffu&s;ive detraction may be traced in almo&s;t every page of the biographer: not to encounter it on its fir&s;t appearance, and wherever it is vi&s;ible and important, would be to fail in that ju&s;tice and regard towards the character of Milton, which he, perhaps, of all men, has mo&s;t eminently de&s;erved.</P>
<P>In the preceding citation it is evidently the purpo&s;e of Dr. John&s;on to degrade Milton below Cowley, and many other poets, di&s;tingui&s;hed by juvenile compo&s;itions; but Mr. Warton has, with great ta&s;te and judgment, expo&s;ed the error of Dr. John&s;on, in preferring the Latin poetry of Cowley to that of Milton. An eminent foreign critic has be&s;towed that high prai&s;e on the juvenile productions of our author, which his prejudiced countryman is inclined to deny. Morhoff has affirmed, with equal truth and libera|lity, that the ver&s;es, which Milton produced in his childhood, di&s;cover both the fire and judgment of maturer life: a commendation that no impartial reader will be inclined to extenuate, who peru&s;es the &s;pirited epi&s;tle to his exiled pre|ceptor, compo&s;ed in his eighteenth year. Some of his Engli&s;h ver&s;es bear an earlier date. The fir&s;t of his juvenile productions, in the language which he was de&s;tined to enno|ble, is a paraphra&s;e of the hundred and fourteenth p&s;alm; it was executed at the age of fifteen, and di&s;covers a power that Dryden, and other more pre&s;umptuous critics, have
<PB N="15" REF="36">
unju&s;tly denied to Milton, the power of moving with faci|lity in the fetters of rhyme: this power is &s;till more con&s;pi|cuous in the poem he wrote at the age of &s;eventeen, on the death of his &s;i&s;ter's child; a compo&s;ition peculiarly enti|tled to the notice of tho&s;e, who love to contemplate the early dawn of poetical genius. In this performance, puerile as it is in every &s;en&s;e of the word, the intelligent reader may yet di&s;cern, as in the bud, all the &s;triking characteri&s;tics of Milton; his affectionate &s;en&s;ibility, his &s;uperior imagina|tion, and all that native tendency to devotional enthu&s;ia&s;m,
<Q><L>Which &s;ets the heart on fire,</L>
<L>To &s;purn the &s;ordid world, and unto Heav'n a&s;pire.</L></Q>
Admirably trained as the youth of the poet was to acquire academical honour by the union of indu&s;try and talents, he &s;eems to have experienced at Cambridge a chequered for|tune, very &s;imilar to his de&s;tiny in the world. It appears from &s;ome remarkable pa&s;&s;ages in the Latin exerci&s;es, which he recited in his College, that he was at fir&s;t an object of partial &s;everity, and afterwards of general admiration, He had differed in opinion concerning a plan of academical &s;tudies with &s;ome per&s;ons of authority in his college, and thus ex|cited their di&s;plea&s;ure. He &s;peaks of them as highly in|cen&s;ed again&s;t him; but expre&s;&s;es, with the mo&s;t liberal &s;en&s;ibility, his &s;urpri&s;e, delight, and gratitude, in finding that his enemies forgot their animo&s;ity to honour him with unex|pected applau&s;e.</P>
<P>An idle &s;tory has been circulated concerning his treatment in College. "I am a&s;hamed," &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, "to relate
<PB N="16" REF="37">
what I fear is true, that Milton was the la&s;t &s;tudent in either Univer&s;ity that &s;uffered the public indignity of cor|poral puni&s;hment." In confirmation of this incident, which appears improbable, though &s;upported by Mr. Warton, the biographical critic alledges the following pa&s;&s;age from the fir&s;t Elegy:
<Q LANG="lat"><LG>
<L>Jam nec arundiferum mihi cura revi&s;ere Camum,</L>
<L>Nec dudum vetiti me laris angit amor;</L>
<L>Nec duri libet u&s;que minas perferre magi&s;tri,</L>
<L>Caeteraque ingenio non &s;ubeunda meo.</L>
</LG></Q>
<Q LANG="eng"><LG>
<L>Nor zeal nor duty now my &s;teps impel</L>
<L>To reedy Cam and my forbidden cell;</L>
<L>'Tis time that I a pedant's threats di&s;dain,</L>
<L>And fly from wrongs my &s;oul will ne'er &s;u&s;tain.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on con&s;iders the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions as an ab&s;olute proof, that Milton was obliged to undergo this indignity; but they may &s;ugge&s;t a very different idea. From all the light we can obtain concerning this anecdote, it &s;eems mo&s;t probable, that Milton was threatened, indeed, with what he con&s;idered as a puni&s;hment, not only di&s;honourable but un|merited; that his manly &s;pirit di&s;dained to &s;ubmit to it; and that he was therefore obliged to acquie&s;ce in a &s;hort exile from Cambridge.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of his academical life, it is nece&s;&s;ary to obvi|ate another remark of a &s;imilar tendency.</P>
<P>"There is rea&s;on," &s;ays John&s;on, "to &s;u&s;pect that he was regarded in his college with no great fondne&s;s." To coun|teract
<PB N="17" REF="38">
this invidious in&s;inuation we are furni&s;hed with a reply, made by Milton him&s;elf, to this very calumny, ori|ginally fabricated by one of his contemporaries; a calumny, which he had &s;o fully refuted, that it ought to have revived no more! He begins with thanking his reviler for the a&s;per|&s;ion: "It has given me," he &s;ays, <Q>an apt occa&s;ion to ac|knowledge publicly, with all grateful mind, that more than ordinary favour and re&s;pect, which I found, above any of my equals, at the hand of tho&s;e courteous and learned men, the Fellows of that College, wherein I &s;pent &s;ome years; who, at my parting, after I had taken two degrees, as the manner is, &s;ignified many ways how much better it would content them that I would &s;tay, as by many let|ters, full of kindne&s;s and loving re&s;pect, both before that time and long after, I was a&s;&s;ured of their &s;ingular good affection towards me.&mdash;<BIBL>Pro&s;e Works, vol. 1, p. 15.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Latin poems of Milton are yet entitled to more of our attention; becau&s;e they exhibit lively proofs, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both tenderne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m, tho&s;e primary con|&s;tituents of a poet, at an early period of life, and in the highe&s;t degree: they have additional value, from making us acquainted with &s;everal intere&s;ting particulars of his youth, and many of his opinions, which mu&s;t have had con&s;iderable influence on his moral character.</P>
<P>His &s;ixth Elegy, addre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om friend, Charles Diodati, &s;eems to be founded on the idea, which he may be &s;aid to have verified in his own conduct, that &s;trict habits of temperance and virtue are highly conducive to the perfec|tion of great poetical powers. To poets of a lighter cla&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="39">
he recommends, with graceful plea&s;antry, much convivial en|joyment; but for tho&s;e who a&s;pire to Epic renown, he pre&s;cribes even the &s;imple regimen of Pythagoras.</P>

<P>In his Elegy on the Spring, our poet expre&s;&s;es the fervent emotions of his fancy in terms, that may be almo&s;t regarded as a prophetic de&s;cription of his &s;ublime&s;t work:
<Q LANG="lat"><LG>
<L>Jam mihi mens liquidi raptatur in ardua caeli,</L>
<L>Perque vagas nubes corpore liber eo;</L>
<L>Intuiturque animus toto quid agatur Olympo,</L>

<L>And no Tartarean depths elude my &s;ight.</L>
</LG></Q>
With the&s;e ver&s;es it may be plea&s;ing to compare a &s;imilar pa&s;&s;age in his Engli&s;h vacation exerci&s;e, where, addre&s;&s;ing his native language, as applied to an incon&s;iderable purpo&s;e, he adds,
<Q><L>Yet I had rather, if I were to chu&s;e,</L>
<L>Thy &s;ervice in &s;ome graver &s;ubject u&s;e;</L>
<L>Such as may make thee &s;earch thy coffers round,</L>

<P>"It is worth the curious reader's attention to ob&s;erve how much the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t corre&s;ponds with this prophetic wi&s;h," &s;ays Mr. Thyer, one of the mo&s;t intelligent and libe|ral of Engli&s;h commentators.</P>
<P>The young poet, who thus expre&s;&s;ed his ambition, was then in his nineteenth year. At the age of twenty-one (the period of his life when that plea&s;ing portrait of him was ex|ecuted, which the Speaker On&s;low obtained from the exe|cutors of his widow) he compo&s;ed his Ode on the Nativity; a poem that &s;urpa&s;&s;es in fancy and devotional fire a compo|&s;ition on the &s;ame &s;ubject by that celebrated and devout poet of Spain, Lopez de Vega.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="41">The mo&s;t trifling performances of Milton are &s;o &s;ingular, that we may regret even the lo&s;s of the ver&s;es alluded to by Aubrey, as the offspring of his childhood. Perhaps no ju|venile author ever di&s;played, with &s;uch early force,

<P>Such au&s;terity and moro&s;ene&s;s have been fal&s;ely attributed to Milton, that a reader, acquainted with him only as he appears in the page of John&s;on, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him little formed for love; but his poetry in general, and e&s;pecially the compo&s;itions we are now &s;peaking of, may convince us, that he felt, with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, the magic of beauty, and all the force of female attraction. His &s;eventh Elegy exhibits a lively picture of his fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion; he repre|&s;ents him&s;elf as captivated by an unknown fair, who, though he &s;aw her but for a moment, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his heart.

<P>This very intere&s;ting epi&s;tle, in which Milton pours forth his heart to the favourite friend of his youth, may con|vince every candid reader, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in no common degree, two qualities very rarely united, ambitious ardour of mind and unaffected mode&s;ty. The poet, who &s;peaks with &s;uch graceful humility of his literary atchievements, had at this time written Comus, a compo&s;ition that abund|antly di&s;plays the variety and compa&s;s of his poetical powers. After he had delineated, with equal excellence, the frolics
<PB N="28" REF="49">
of gaiety and the triumphs of virtue, pa&s;&s;ing with exqui&s;ite tran&s;ition from the mo&s;t &s;portive to the &s;ublime&s;t tones of poetry, he might have &s;poken more confidently of his own productions without a particle of arrogance.</P>
<P>We know not exactly what poems he compo&s;ed during his re&s;idence at Horton. The Arcades &s;eems to have been one of his early compo&s;itions, and it was intended as a compliment to his fair neighbour, the accompli&s;hed Counte&s;s Dowager of Derby; &s;he was the &s;ixth daughter of Sir John Spencer, and allied to Spencer the poet, who, with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty and tenderne&s;s, has celebrated her under the title of Amarillis. At the hou&s;e of this lady, near Uxbridge, Milton is &s;aid to have been a frequent vi&s;itor. The Earl of Bridgewater, before whom, and by who&s;e children, Comus was repre|&s;ented, had married a daughter of Ferdinando Earl of Derby, and thus, as Mr. Warton ob&s;erves, it was for the &s;ame family that Milton wrote both the Arcades and Comus. It is probable that the plea&s;ure, which the Arcades afforded to the young relations of the Counte&s;s, gave ri&s;e to Comus, as Lawes, the mu&s;ical friend of Milton, in dedi|cating the ma&s;k to the young Lord Brackley, her grand&s;on, &s;ays, "this poem, which received its fir&s;t occa&s;ion of birth from your&s;elf and others of your noble family, and much honour from your own per&s;on in the performance."</P>
<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of Lawes allude, perhaps, to the real in|cident, which is &s;aid to have &s;upplied the &s;ubject of Comus, and may &s;eem to confirm an anecdote related by Mr. Warton, from a manu&s;cript of Oldys; that the young and noble per|formers in this celebrated drama were really involved in
<PB N="29" REF="50">
adventures very &s;imilar to their theatrical &s;ituation; that in vi&s;iting their relations, in Hereford&s;hire, they were benighted in a fore&s;t, and the lady Alice Egerton actually lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the origin of the ma&s;k, the mode&s;ty of the youthful poet appears very con&s;picuous in the follow|ing words of Lawes's dedication: <Q>Although not openly acknowledged by the author, yet it is a legitimate off|&s;pring, &s;o lovely and &s;o much de&s;ired, that the often copy|ing of it hath tired my pen, to give my &s;everal friends &s;a|tisfaction, and brought me to a nece&s;&s;ity of producing it to the public view.</Q></P>
<P>Milton di&s;covered a &s;imilar diffidence re&s;pecting his Lyci|das, which was written while he re&s;ided with his father, in November, 1637. This exqui&s;ite poem, which, as Mr. Warton ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>mu&s;t have been either &s;olicited as a favour by tho&s;e whom the poet had le&s;t in his college, or was a voluntary contribution of friend&s;hip &s;ent to them from the country,</Q> appeared fir&s;t in the academical col|lection of ver&s;es on the death of Mr. Edward King, and was &s;ub&s;cribed only with the initials of its author.</P>
<P>An animated and benevolent veteran of critici&s;m, Doctor Warton, has con&s;idered a reli&s;h for the Lycidas as a te&s;t of true ta&s;te in poetry; and it certainly is a te&s;t, which no lover of Milton will be inclined to di&s;pute; though it mu&s;t ex|clude from the li&s;t of accompli&s;hed critics that intemperate cen&s;or of the great poet, who has endeavoured to de&s;troy the reputation of his celebrated monody with the mo&s;t in&s;ult|ing expre&s;&s;ions of &s;arca&s;tic contempt; expre&s;&s;ions that no reader of a &s;pirit truly poetical can peru&s;e without mingled
<PB N="30" REF="51">
emotions of indignation and of pity! But the charms of Lycidas are of a texture too firm to be annihilated by the breath of deri&s;ion; and though Doctor John&s;on has declared the poem to be utterly de&s;titute both of nature and of art, it will a&s;&s;uredly continue to be admired as long as tender|ne&s;s, imagination, and harmony, are regarded as genuine &s;ources of poetical delight.</P>
<P>The effect of this favourite compo&s;ition is exactly &s;uch as the poet intended to produce; it fir&s;t engages the heart with the &s;implicity of ju&s;t and natural &s;orrow, and then pro|ceeds to elevate the mind with magnificent images, ennobled by affectionate and devotional enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>The beauties of this pathetic and &s;ublime monody are &s;ufficiently obvious; but the reader, who compares it with a poem on the &s;ame &s;ubject by Cleveland, once the popular rival of Milton, may derive plea&s;ure from perceiving how infinitely our favourite poet has excelled, on this occa&s;ion, an eminent antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Though we find no circum&s;tances, that may a&s;certain the date of the Allegro and Pen&s;oro&s;o, it &s;eems probable, that tho&s;e two enchanting pictures of rural life, and of the di|ver&s;ified delights ari&s;ing from a contemplative mind, were compo&s;ed at Horton. It was, perhaps, in the &s;ame &s;ituation, &s;o favourable to poetical exertions, that Milton wrote the incomparable Latin poem addre&s;&s;ed to his father. There are, indeed, &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in this performance, which may favour an opinion that it ought to bear an earlier date; but it has &s;uch &s;trength and manline&s;s of &s;entiment, as incline me to &s;uppo&s;e it written at this period; an idea that &s;eems
<PB N="31" REF="52">
almo&s;t confirmed by the lines, that &s;peak of his application to French and Italian, after the completion of his cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Whatever date may be a&s;&s;igned to it, the compo&s;ition de|&s;erves our particular regard, &s;ince, of all his poems, it does the highe&s;t honour to his heart.</P>
<P>With what energy and tenderne&s;s is his filial gratitude expre&s;&s;ed in the following graceful exordium:

<P>"He began now," &s;ays John&s;on, <Q>to grow weary of the country, and had &s;ome purpo&s;e of taking chambers in the inns of court.</Q></P>
<P>This wearine&s;s appears to have exi&s;ted only in the fancy of his biographer. During the five years that Milton re&s;ided with his parents, in Buckingham&s;hire, he had occa&s;ional lodgings in London, which he vi&s;ited, as he informs us him|&s;elf, for the purpo&s;e of buying books, and improving him|&s;elf in mathematics and in mu&s;ic, at that time his favourite amu&s;ements. The letter, which intimates his intention of taking chambers in the inns of court, was not written
<PB N="36" REF="57">
from the country, as his biographer &s;eems to have &s;uppo&s;ed; it is dated from London, and only expre&s;&s;es, that his quar|ters there appeared to him awkward and inconvenient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dicam jam nunc &s;erio quid cogitem, in ho&s;pitium juridicorum aliquod immigrare, ficubi amoena et umbro&s;a ambulatio e&s;t, quod et inter aliquot &s;odales, commodior illic habi|tatio, &s;i domi manere, et <GAP DESC="foreign"> quocunque libitum erit excutrere: ubi nunc &s;um, ut no&s;ti, ob&s;cur&egrave; et angu&s;t&egrave; &s;um.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the death of his mother, who died in April, 1637, and is buried in the chancel of Horton church, he obtained his father's permi&s;&s;ion to gratify his eager de&s;ire of vi&s;iting the continent, a permi&s;&s;ion the more readily granted, per|haps, as one of his motives for vi&s;iting Italy was to form a collection of Italian mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Having received &s;ome directions for his travels from the celebrated Sir Henry Wotton, he went, with a &s;ingle &s;er|vant, to Paris, in 1638; he was there honoured by the no|tice of Lord Scudamore, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who, at his earne&s;t de&s;ire, gave him an introduction to Grotius, then re&s;iding at Paris as the mini&s;ter of Sweden.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity is naturally excited by the idea of a conference between two per&s;ons &s;o eminent and accompli&s;hed. It has been conjectured, that Milton might conceive his fir&s;t de|&s;ign of writing a tragedy on the bani&s;hment of Adam from this interview with Grotius; but if the Adamus Ex&s;ul of the Swedi&s;h amba&s;&s;ador were a &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e, it is probable its author mu&s;t have &s;poken of it but &s;lightly, as a juvenile compo&s;ition, &s;ince he does &s;o in a letter to his friend Vo&s;&s;ius, in 1616, concerning a new edition of his
<PB N="37" REF="58">
poetry, from which he particularly excluded this &s;acred drama, as too puerile, in his own judgment, to be re-pub|li&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tum patientem recudendum judico, ideoque velim aliquod ejus exemplum ad me mitti, ut errata typographica corrigam, quando ip&s;e nullum habeo. Adami Exulis poema juvenilius e&s;t quam ut au&s;im addere. Grotii Epi&s;t. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The letters of Grotius, voluminous and circum&s;tantial as they are, afford no traces of this intere&s;ting vi&s;it; but they lead me to imagine, that the point, which the learned amba&s;&s;ador mo&s;t warmly recommended to Milton, on his departure for Italy, was, to pay the kinde&s;t attention in his power to the &s;ufferings of Galileo, then per&s;ecuted as a pri|&s;oner by the inqui&s;ition in Florence.</P>
<P>In a letter to Vo&s;&s;ius, dated in the very month when Milton was probably introduced to Grotius, that liberal friend to &s;cience and humanity &s;peaks thus of Galileo: "This old man, to whom the univer&s;e is &s;o deeply indebted, worn out with maladies, and &s;till more with angui&s;h of mind, give us little rea&s;on to hope, that his life can be long; common prudence, therefore, &s;ugge&s;ts to us to make the utmo&s;t of the time, while we can yet avail our&s;elves of &s;uch an in&s;tructor<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Senex is, optime de univer&s;o meritus, mor|bo fractus, in&s;uper et animi aegritudine, haud multum nobis vitae &s;uae promittit; quare pru|dentiae erit arripere tempus, dum tanto doctore uti licet. Grotii Epi&s;t. 964.</NOTE>." Milton was, of all travellers, the mo&s;t likely to &s;eize a hint of this kind with avidity, and expre&s;&s;ions in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t have led an Italian biographer of the poet to &s;uppo&s;e, that while he re&s;ided at Florence he caught from Galileo, or his di&s;ciples, &s;ome ideas approaching towards the Newtonian philo&s;ophy. He has informed us him&s;elf, that he really &s;aw the illu&s;trious &s;cientific pri&s;oner of the inqui|&s;ition,
<PB N="38" REF="59">
and it &s;eems not unrea&s;onable to conclude, that he was in &s;ome degree indebted to his conference with Grotius for that mournful gratification.</P>
<P>From Paris our author proceeded to Italy, embarking at Nice for Genoa. After a cur&s;ory view of Leghorn and Pi&s;a, he &s;ettled for two months at Florence; a city, which he particularly regarded for the elegance of its language, and the men of genius it had produced; here, as he in|forms us, he became familiar with many per&s;ons di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their rank and learning; and here, probably, he began to form tho&s;e great, but un&s;ettled, projects of future compo&s;ition, which were to prove the &s;ources of his glory, and of which he thus &s;peaks him&s;elf:</P>
<Q>In the private academies of Italy, whither I was fa|voured to re&s;ort, perceiving that &s;ome trifles I had in memory, compo&s;ed at under twenty, or thereabout (for the manner is, that every one mu&s;t give &s;ome proof of his wit and reading there) met with acceptance above what was looked for, and other things, which I had &s;hifted, in &s;carcity of books and conveniency, to patch up among&s;t them, were received with written encomiums, which the Italian is not forward to be&s;tow on men of this &s;ide the Alps, I began thus far to a&s;&s;ent both to them, and di|vers of my friends here at home, and not le&s;s to an in|ward prompting, which now grew daily upon me, that by labour and intent &s;tudy, (which I take to be my por|tion in this life) joined with the &s;trong propen&s;ity of na|ture, I might, perhaps, leave &s;omething &s;o written to after-times as they &s;hould not willingly let it die. The&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="60">
thoughts at once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, and the&s;e other, that if I were certain to write as men buy lea&s;es, for three lives and downward, there ought no regard to be &s;ooner had than to God's glory, by the honour and in&s;truction of my coun|try; for which cau&s;e, and not only for that I knew it would be hard to arrive at the &s;econd rank among the Latins, I applied my&s;elf to that re&s;olution, which Ario&s;to followed again&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ions of Bembo, to fix all the indu&s;try and art I could unite to the adorning of my na|tive tongue; not to make verbal curio&s;ities the end, (that were a toil&s;ome vanity) but to be an interpreter and re|later of the be&s;t and &s;age&s;t things among mine own citi|zens throughout this i&s;land in the mother dialect; that what the greate&s;t and choice&s;t wits of Athens, Rome, or modern Italy, and tho&s;e Hebrews of old, did for their country, I in my proportion, with this over and above of being a Chri&s;tian, might do for mine, not caring to be once named abroad, though, perhaps, I could attain to that, but content with the&s;e Briti&s;h i&s;lands as my world. <BIBL>Pro&s;e Works, vol. 1. p. 62.</BIBL></Q>
<P>It is delightful to contemplate &s;uch a character as Milton, thus cheri&s;hing, in his own mind, the &s;eeds of future great|ne&s;s, and animating his youthful &s;pirit with vi&s;ions of re|nown, that time has realized and extended beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He appears, on every occa&s;ion, a &s;incere and fervent lover of his country, and expre&s;&s;es, in one of his Latin Poems, the

&s;ame patriotic idea, that he &s;hould be &s;atisfied with glory confined to the&s;e I&s;lands.</P>

<P>In tracing the literary ambition of Milton from the fir&s;t conception of his great purpo&s;es to their accompli&s;hment, we &s;eem to participate in the triumph of his genius, which, though it a&s;pired only to the prai&s;e of the&s;e Briti&s;h i&s;lands, is already grown an object of univer&s;al admiration, and may find hereafter, in the we&s;tern world, the ample&s;t theatre of his glory.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on takes occa&s;ion, from the pa&s;&s;age in which Milton &s;peaks of the literary projects he conceived in Italy,
<PB N="41" REF="62">
to remark, that <Q>he had a lofty and &s;teady confidence in him&s;elf, perhaps not without &s;ome contempt of others.</Q> The latter part of this ob&s;ervation is evidently invidious; it is completely refuted by the various commendations, which the graceful and engaging manners or the poetical traveller received from the Italians: a contemptuous &s;pirit, indeed, appears utterly incompatible with the native di&s;po&s;ition of Milton, who&s;e generous enthu&s;ia&s;m led him to conceive the fonde&s;t veneration for all, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by ge|nius or virtue; a di&s;po&s;ition, which he has expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, as the reader may recollect, in a letter, al|ready cited, to his friend Diodati! His prejudiced biographer endeavours to prove, that his &s;pirit was contemptuous, by ob&s;erving, that he was frugal of his prai&s;e. The argument is particularly defective, as applied to Milton on his travels; &s;ince the prai&s;es he be&s;towed on tho&s;e accompli&s;hed fo|reigners, who were kind to him, are liberal in the highe&s;t de|gree, and apparently dictated by the heart.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort vi&s;it to Sienna, he re&s;ided two months in Rome, enjoying the mo&s;t refined &s;ociety, which that city could afford. By the favour of Hol&s;tenius, the well known librarian of the Vatican (who&s;e kindne&s;s to him he has re|corded in a Latin Epi&s;tle equally grateful and elegant) he was recommended to the notice of Cardinal Barberini, who honoured him with the mo&s;t flattering attention; it was at the concerts of the Cardinal that he was captivated by the charms of Leonora Baroni, who&s;e extraordinary mu&s;ical powers he has celebrated in Latin ver&s;e, and whom he is &s;up|po&s;ed to addre&s;s as a lover in his Italian poetry. The mo&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="63">
eloquent of the pa&s;&s;ions, which is &s;aid to convert almo&s;t every man who feels it into a poet, induced the imagination of Milton to try its powers in a foreign language, who&s;e diffi|culties he &s;eems to have perfectly &s;ubdued by the united aids of genius and of love.</P>
<P>His Italian &s;onnets have been liberally commended by na|tives of Italy, and one of them contains a &s;ketch of his own character, &s;o &s;pirited and &s;ingular as to claim a place in this narrative.</P>

<P>It was at Rome that Milton was complimented, in Latin ver&s;e, by Selvaggi and Sal&s;illi: his reply to the latter, then &s;uffering from a &s;evere malady, is &s;o remarkable for its ele|gance, tenderne&s;s, and &s;pirit, that Mr. Warton prai&s;es it as one of the fine&s;t lyrical compo&s;itions, which the Latin poetry of modern times can exhibit.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances that happened to our author in his travels, and, indeed, the mo&s;t &s;triking particulars of his life, are related by him&s;elf, in his "Second Defence." He there tells us, that in pa&s;&s;ing from Rome to Naples his fellow-traveller was a hermit, who introduced him to Bapti&s;ta Man&s;o, Marquis of Villa, an accompli&s;hed nobleman, and &s;ingularly di&s;tingui&s;hed as the friend and the biographer of two eminent poets, Ta&s;&s;o and Marini; they have both left poetical memorials of their e&s;teem for the Marquis, who acquired his title as a &s;oldier in the &s;ervice of Spain, but retiring early, with con&s;iderable wealth, to Naples, his native
<PB N="44" REF="65">
city, he founded there a literary academy, and lived in &s;plen|dor as its pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>This graceful and venerable hero, who&s;e politene&s;s and learning had been fondly celebrated by Ta&s;&s;o, in a dia|logue on friend&s;hip, that bears the name of Man&s;o, was near eighty when Milton become his gue&s;t: he &s;eems to have been endeared to the imagination of our poet by the liberal and affectionate tribute he had paid to the memory of his illu&s;trious poetical friends; a tribute very feelingly de&s;cribed by Milton in the following lines, addre&s;&s;ed to the noble and generous biographer&mdash;they &s;peak fir&s;t of Marini:

<P>The preceding ver&s;es have various claims to attention; they exhibit a lively picture of the literary project that oc|cupied the mind of Milton at this period; they forcibly prove with what vehemence of de&s;ire he panted for poetical

immortality, and for the &s;uperior rewards of a laborious life, devoted to piety and virtue.</P>
<P>His acquaintance with Man&s;o may be regarded as the mo&s;t fortunate incident of his foreign excur&s;ion. Nothing could have a greater tendency to pre&s;erve and &s;trengthen the &s;eeds of poetic enterprize in the mind of the young travel|ler, than, his familiarity with this eminent and engaging per|&s;onage, the bo&s;om friend of Ta&s;&s;o; the friend who had che|ri&s;hed that great and afflicted poet under his roof in a &s;ea|&s;on of his mental calamity, had re&s;tored his health, re-ani|mated his fancy, and given a religious turn to the late&s;t efforts of his maje&s;tic mu&s;e. The very life of Ta&s;&s;o, which this noble biographer had written with the copious and minute fidelity of per&s;onal knowledge, and with the ardour of affectionate enthu&s;ia&s;m, might be &s;ufficient to give new energy to Milton's early pa&s;&s;ion for poetical renown: his conver&s;ation had, probably, a &s;till greater tendency to pro|duce this effect. Circum&s;tances remote, and apparently of little moment, have often a marvellous influence on the works of imagination; nor is it too wild a conjecture to &s;up|po&s;e, that the zeal of Man&s;o, in &s;peaking to Milton of his departed friend, might give force and permanence to that literary ambition, which ultimately rendered his a&s;piring gue&s;t the great rival of Ta&s;&s;o, and, in the e&s;timation of Eng|li&s;hmen, his &s;uperior.</P>
<P>From Naples it was the de&s;ign of Milton to pa&s;s into Sicily and Greece; but receiving intelligence of the civil war in England, he felt it incon&s;i&s;tent with his principles to wander
<PB N="50" REF="71">
abroad, even for the improvement of his mind, while his countrymen were contending for liberty at home.</P>
<P>In preparing for his return to Rome, he was cautioned again&s;t it by &s;ome mercantile friends, who&s;e letters inti|mated, that he had much to apprehend from the machina|tions of Engli&s;h je&s;uits, if he appeared again in that city; they were incen&s;ed again&s;t him by the freedom of his di&s;|cour&s;e on topics of religion: "I had made it a rule (&s;ays Milton) never to &s;tart a religious &s;ubject in this country; but if I were que&s;tioned on my faith, never to di&s;&s;emble, whatever I might &s;uffer. I returned, neverthele&s;s, to Rome," continues the undaunted traveller, "and, whenever I was in|terrogated, I attempted no di&s;gui&s;e: if any one attacked my principles, I defended the true religion in the very city of the pope, and, during almo&s;t two months, with as much freedom as I had u&s;ed before. By the protection of God I returned &s;afe again to Florence, re-vi&s;iting friends, who re|ceived me as gladly as if I had been re&s;tored to my native home<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Siciliam quoque et Graeciam trajicere volentem me, tri&s;tis ex Anglia belli civilis nuntius revocavit; turpe enim exi&s;timabam, dum mei cives domi de libertate dimicarent, ne animi cau&s;&acirc; otio&s;e peregrinati.

<P>After a &s;econd re&s;idence of almo&s;t two months in Flo|rence, whence he made an excur&s;ion to Lucca, a place
<PB N="51" REF="72">
endeared to him by having produced the ance&s;tors of his favourite friend Diodati, he extended his travels through Bologna and Ferrara to Venice. Here, he remained a month, and having &s;ent hence a collection of books, and parti|cularly of mu&s;ic, by &s;ea, he proceeded him&s;elf through Verona and Milan to Geneva. In this city he was parti|cularly gratified by the &s;ociety and kindne&s;s of John Diodati, uncle of his young friend, who&s;e untimely death he lamented in a Latin poem, of which we &s;hall &s;oon have occa&s;ion to &s;peak. Returning by his former road through France, he reached England at a period that &s;eems to have made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, when the king was waging, in favour of epi&s;copacy, his unpro&s;per|ous war with the Scots. The time of Milton's ab&s;ence from his native country exceeded not, by his own account, a year and three months.</P>
<P>In the relation that he gives him&s;elf of his return, the name of Geneva recalling to his mind one of the mo&s;t &s;lan|derous of his political adver&s;aries, he animates his narrative by a &s;olemn appeal to heaven on his un&s;potted integrity; he prote&s;ts that, during his re&s;idence in foreign &s;cenes, where licentiou&s;ne&s;s was univer&s;al, his own conduct was perfectly irreproachable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quae urbs, cum in mentem mihi hinc veniat Mori calumniatoris, &s;acit ut deum hic rur&s;us te&s;tem invocem, me his omnibus in locis, ubi tam multa licent, ab omni flagitio ac probro integrum atque intactum vixi&s;&s;e, illud perpetuo cogitantem, &s;i hominum la|tere oculos po&s;&s;em, dei certe non po&s;&s;e.</NOTE>. I dwell the more zealou&s;ly on whatever may elucidate the moral character of Milton, becau&s;e, even among tho&s;e who love and revere him, the &s;plendor of the poet has in &s;ome mea&s;ure eclip&s;ed the merit of the man; but in
<PB N="52" REF="73">
proportion as the particulars of his life are &s;tudied with in|telligence and candour, his virtue will become, as it ought to be, the friendly rival of his genius, and receive its due &s;hare of admiration and e&s;teem. Men, indeed, of narrow minds, and of &s;ervile principles, will for ever attempt to depreciate a character &s;o ab&s;olutely the rever&s;e of their own; but liberal &s;pirits, who allow to others that freedom of &s;en|timent, which they vindicate for them&s;elves, however they di&s;approve or oppo&s;e the opinions of the &s;ectary and the republican, will render honourable and affectionate ju&s;tice to the patriotic benevolence, the indu&s;try, and the courage, with which Milton endeavoured to promote what he &s;incerely and fervently regarded as the true intere&s;t of his country.</P>
<P>We have now attended him to the middle &s;tage of his life, at which it may not be improper to pau&s;e, and make a few remarks on the years that are pa&s;&s;ed, and tho&s;e that are yet in pro&s;pect. We behold him, at the age of thirty-two, recalled to England, from a foreign excur&s;ion of improvement and de|light, by a manly &s;en&s;e of what he owed to his country in a &s;ea&s;on of difficulty and danger. His thoughts and conduct on this occa&s;ion are the more noble and becoming, as all his preceding years had been employed in forming, for the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es, a firm and lofty mind, and in furni&s;h|ing it abundantly with whatever might be u&s;eful and ho|nourable to him&s;elf and others, in the various exigencies and vici&s;&s;itudes both of private and public life. We have traced him through a long cour&s;e of infantine, academical, do|me&s;tic, and foreign &s;tudy; we have &s;een him di&s;tingui&s;hed by application, docility, and genius; uncommonly attached
<PB N="53" REF="74">
to his in&s;tructors, and mo&s;t amiably grateful to his parents; in friend&s;hip, ardent and &s;teady; in love, though tender not intemperate; as a poet, &s;en&s;ible of his rare mental endow|ments, yet peculiarly mode&s;t in regard to his own produc|tions; enamoured of glory, yet as ready to be&s;tow as anxi|ous to merit prai&s;e; in his per&s;on and manners &s;o fa&s;hioned to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s all men in his favour, that even foreigners gave him credit for tho&s;e high literary atchievements, which were to &s;hed peculiar lu&s;tre on his latter days, and con&s;idered him already as a man, of whom his country might be proud.</P>
<P>With &s;uch accompli&s;hments, and &s;uch expectations in his behalf, Milton returned to England. The &s;ub&s;equent por|tion of his life, however gloomy and tempe&s;tuous, will be found to corre&s;pond, at lea&s;t in the clo&s;e of it, with the ra|diant promi&s;e of his youth. We &s;hall &s;ee him de&s;erting his favourite haunts of Parna&s;&s;us to enter the thorny paths of eccle&s;ia&s;tical and political di&s;&s;ention: his principles as a di&s;|putant will be condemned and approved, according to the prevalence of oppo&s;ite and irreconcilable opinions, that fluctuate in the world; but his upright con&s;i&s;tency of con|duct de&s;erves applau&s;e from all hone&s;t and candid men of every per&s;ua&s;ion. The Mu&s;e, indeed, who had ble&s;t him with &s;ingular endowments, and given him &s;o lively a &s;en&s;e of his being con&s;tituted a poet by nature, that when he wrote not ver&s;e, he had the u&s;e (to borrow his own forcible expre&s;&s;ion) "but of his left hand;" the Mu&s;e alone might have a right to reproach him with having acted again&s;t in|ward conviction; but could his mu&s;e have vi&s;ibly appeared to reprove his de&s;ertion of her &s;ervice in a parental remon|&s;trance,

<P>THE narrative may proceed from the information of Milton him&s;elf. On his return he procured a re&s;i|dence in London, ample enough for him&s;elf and his books, and felt happy in renewing his interrupted &s;tudies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ip&s;e, &s;icubi po&s;&s;em, tam rebus turbatis &amp; fluctuantibus, locum con&s;i&s;tendi circum&s;pi|ciens mihi libri&s;que meis, &s;at amplam in urbe domum conduxi; ibi ad intermi&s;&s;a &s;tudia beatulus me recepi; rerum exitu deo imprimis &amp; quibus id muneris populus dabat, facil&egrave; per|mi&s;&s;o.</NOTE>. This fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment (as we learn from his nephew) was a lodging in St. Bride's Church-yard, where he received, as his di&s;ciples, the two &s;ons of his &s;i&s;ter, John and Edward Philips; the latter is his biographer; but although he has written the life of his illu&s;trious relation with a degree of laudable pride and affectionate &s;pirit, he does not commu|nicate that abundance of information, which might have been expected from the advantage he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. In one ar|ticle his pride has a ludicrous effect, as it leads him into an awkward attempt to vindicate his uncle from the fancied opprobrium of having engaged profe&s;&s;ionally in the educa|tion of youth; a profe&s;&s;ion which, from its utility and impor|tance,
<PB N="56" REF="77">
from the talents and virtues it requires, is un|que&s;tionably entitled to re&s;pect. Philips will not allow that his uncle actually kept a &s;chool, as he taught only the &s;ons of his particular friends. John&s;on ridicules this di&s;tinction, and &s;eems determined to treat Milton as a profe&s;t &s;chool|ma&s;ter, for the &s;ake of attempting to prove, that he did not &s;u&s;tain the character with advantage, but adopted a vain and prepo&s;terous plan of education.</P>
<P>"Let me not be cen&s;ured," &s;ays the Doctor, <Q>as pedantic or paradoxical; for if I have Milton again&s;t me, I have Socrates on my &s;ide: it was his labour to turn philo&s;o|phy from the &s;tudy of nature to &s;peculations upon life; but the innovators, whom I oppo&s;e, are turning off atten|tion from life to nature; they &s;eem to think that we are placed here to watch the growth of plants, or the motions of the &s;tars; Socrates was rather of opinion, that what we had to learn was, how to do good and avoid evil.</Q></P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
<P>This in&s;idious artifice of repre&s;enting Milton and Socrates as antagoni&s;ts is peculiarly unfortunate, &s;ince no man appears to have imbibed the principles of Socratic wi&s;dom more deeply than our poet; his regard and attachment to them is fervently expre&s;&s;ed, even in his juvenile letters; the very maxims of moral truth, which he is accu&s;ed of counteract|ing, never &s;hone with more lu&s;tre than in the following pa&s;&s;age of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t:
<Q><PB N="57" REF="78">
<L>But apt the mind or fancy is to rove</L>
<L>Uncheck'd, and of her roving is no end,</L>
<L>Till warn'd, or by experience taught, &s;he learn.</L>
<L>That not to know at large of things remote</L>
<L>From u&s;e, ob&s;cure and &s;ubtle, but to know</L>
<L>That, which before us lies in daily life,</L>
<L>Is the prime wi&s;dom; what is more is fume,</L>
<L>Or emptine&s;s, or fond impertinence,</L>
<L>And renders us in things that mo&s;t concern,</L>
<L>Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and &s;till to &s;eek.</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e beautiful lines are built in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as Bentley has remarked, upon a ver&s;e of Homer, the very ver&s;e admired by Socrates, which Dr. John&s;on has not &s;crupled to quote, as a part of his &s;ingular ill-grounded attempt to prove that Milton's ideas of education were in direct oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of the great morali&s;t of Greece; an attempt that aro&s;e from a very inoffen&s;ive boa&s;t of Milton's nephew, who gives a long li&s;t of books peru&s;ed by the &s;cholars of his uncle, which merely proves, that they read more books than are u&s;ually read in our common &s;chools; and that their diligent in|&s;tructor thought it advi&s;able for boys, as they approach to|wards &s;ixteen, to blend a little knowledge of the &s;ciences with their Greek and Latin.</P>
<P>That he taught the familiar and u&s;eful doctrine of the Attic philo&s;opher, even in his lighter poetry, we have a plea&s;ing in&s;tance in the following lines of his &s;onnet to Syriac Skinner, who was one of his &s;cholars:
<Q><L>To mea&s;ure life learn thou betimes, and know</L>
<L>Toward &s;olid good what leads the neare&s;t way.</L></Q>
<PB N="58" REF="79">
But his brief treati&s;e, addre&s;&s;ed to Hartlib, affords, perhaps, the be&s;t proof that his ideas of moral di&s;cipline were per|fectly in uni&s;on with tho&s;e of Socrates; he &s;ays, in that trea|ti&s;e, <Q>I call a complete and generous education that, which fits a man to perform ju&s;tly, &s;kilfully, and magna|nimou&s;ly, all the offices, both private and public, of peace and war.</Q> Who can define a good education in terms more truly Socratic?</P>
<P>Milton, however, in his attachment to morality, forgot not the claims of religion; his Sundays were devoted to theology, and John&s;on duly prai&s;es the care, with which he in&s;tructed his &s;cholars in the primary duties of men.</P>
<P>With a critic &s;o &s;incerely devout as John&s;on unque&s;tion|ably was, we might have hoped that the &s;ublime piety of our author would have &s;ecured him from &s;arca&s;tic attacks; but we have yet to notice two in&s;ults of this kind, which the acrimony of uncorrected &s;pleen has lavi&s;hed upon Milton as a preceptor.</P>
<P>"From this wonder-working academy," &s;ays the biogra|pher, <Q>I do not know that there ever proceeded any man very eminent for knowledge; its only genuine product, I believe, is a &s;mall hi&s;tory of poetry, written in Latin by his nephew, of which, perhaps, none of my readers ever heard.</Q> The contemptuous &s;pirit and the inaccuracy of this &s;arca&s;m are equally remarkable. The &s;cholars of Mil|ton were far from being numerous. Can it be ju&s;t to &s;peak with deri&s;ion of a &s;mall academy, merely becau&s;e it rai&s;es no celebrated author, when we con&s;ider how few of that de&s;cription every nation produces? We know little of tho&s;e,
<PB N="59" REF="80">
who were under the tuition of our poet, except his two ne|phews; the&s;e were both writers; and a biographer of Mil|ton &s;hould not have utterly forgotten his obligations to Edward Philips, if he allowed no credit to his brother, for the &s;pirited Latin treati&s;e in which that young man ap|peared as the defender of his uncle. But the &s;triking inac|curacy of the critic con&s;i&s;ts in not giving a ju&s;t account of a book that particularly claimed his attention, Philips's Theatrum Poetarum, a book that, under a Latin title, contains in Engli&s;h a very comprehen&s;ive li&s;t of poets, an|cient and modern, with reflections upon many of them, particularly tho&s;e of our own nation. It is remarkable that this book was licen&s;ed Sept. 14, 1674, ju&s;t two months before the death of Milton, and printed the following year. The author a&s;&s;igns an article both to his uncle and his bro|ther. After enumerating the chief works of the former, he mode&s;tly &s;ays, <Q>how far he hath revived the maje&s;ty and true decorum of heroic poe&s;y and tragedy, it will better become a per&s;on le&s;s related than my&s;elf to deliver his judgment.</Q></P>
<P>Though he here &s;uppre&s;&s;es a de&s;ire to prai&s;e his mo&s;t eminent relation, it bur&s;ts forth in an amiable manner, when he comes to &s;peak of his brother; for he calls him, <Q>the maternal nephew and di&s;ciple of an author of mo&s;t de&s;erved fame, late decea&s;ed, being the exacte&s;t of heroic poets (if the truth were well examined, and it is the opi|nion of many, both learned and judicious per&s;ons) either of the ancients or moderns, either of our own or whatever nation el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="81">I tran&s;cribe with plea&s;ure this hone&s;t and &s;imple eulogy; it does credit to the intelligence and affection of the poet's di&s;ciple, and it in &s;ome mea&s;ure vindicates the good &s;en&s;e of our country, by &s;hewing that, in the very year of Milton's decea&s;e, when &s;ome writers have &s;uppo&s;ed that his poetical merit was almo&s;t. utterly unknown, there were per&s;ons in the nation, who under&s;tood his full value.</P>
<P>Let us return to the author in his little academy, and the &s;econd &s;arca&s;tic in&s;ult, which his biographer has be&s;towed upon him as the ma&s;ter of a &s;chool. The lodging in which he &s;ettled, on his arrival from the continent, was &s;oon ex|changed for a more &s;pacious hou&s;e and garden, in Alder&s;|gate-&s;treet, that &s;upplied him with conveniencies for the reception of &s;cholars: on this occa&s;ion John&s;on exclaims, <Q>let not our veneration for Milton forbid us to look with &s;ome degree of merriment on great promi&s;es and &s;mall performance; on the man who ha&s;tens home, becau&s;e his countrymen are contending for their liberty, and, when he reaches the &s;cene of action, vapours away his patrioti&s;m in a private boarding-&s;chool.</Q></P>
<P>To excite merriment by rendering Milton ridiculous for having preferred the pen to the &s;word was an enterpri&s;e that &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the powers of John&s;on; the attempt affords a melancholy proof how far prejudice may mi&s;lead a very vigorous under&s;tanding. What but the blind hatred of bigotry could have tempted one great author to deride another, merely for having thought that he might &s;erve his country more e&s;&s;entially by the rare and highly culti|vated faculties of his mind, than by the ordinary &s;ervice of a
<PB N="61" REF="82">
&s;oldier. But let us hear Milton on this &s;ubject. We have this obligation to the malice of his contemporaries, that it led him to &s;peak publicly of him&s;elf, and to relate, in the mo&s;t manly and explicit manner, the real motives of his conduct.</P>
<P>Speaking of the Engli&s;h people, in the commencement of his Second Defence, he &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quos non legum contemptus aut violatio in effraenatam licentiam effudit; non virtutis &amp; gloriae fal&s;a &s;pecies, aut &s;tulta veterum aemulatio inani nomine libertatis incendit, &s;ed innocentia vitae, morumque &s;anctitas rectum atque &s;olum iter ad libertatem veram docuit, legum et religionis ju&s;ti&s;&s;ima defen&s;io nece&s;|&s;ari&ograve; armavit.

<P>Before he quitted Florence, Milton received intelligence of the lo&s;s he had to &s;u&s;tain, by the untimely death of Charles Diodati, the favourite a&s;&s;ociate of his early &s;tudies. On his arrival in England, the bitterne&s;s of &s;uch a lo&s;s was felt with redoubled &s;en&s;ibility by his affectionate heart, which relieved and gratified it&s;elf by commemorating the engaging character of the decea&s;ed, in a poem of con&s;iderable length, entitled, Epitaphium Damonis, a poem mentioned by John|&s;on with &s;upercilious contempt, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch beauties as render it pre-eminent in that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Many poets have lamented a friend of their youth, and a companion of their &s;tudies, but no one has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the affecting tenderne&s;s with which Milton &s;peaks of his lo&s;t Diodati.

<P>There is, indeed, but one effectual lenitive for wounds of this nature, which Milton happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the &s;incerity and fervour of his religion. He clo&s;es his lamentation for his favourite friend, as he had clo&s;ed his Lycidas, with ju&s;t and &s;oothing reflections on the purity of life, by which the object of his regret was di&s;tingui&s;hed, and with a &s;ublime conception of that cele&s;tial beatitude, which he confidently regarded as the infallible and immediate recompence of de|parted virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="86">Having paid what was due to friend&s;hip in his poetical capacity, he devoted his pen to public affairs, and entered on that career of controver&s;y, which e&s;tranged him &s;o long, and carried him &s;o far from tho&s;e milder and more engaging &s;tudies, that nature and education had made the <HI>darlings of his mind.</HI> If to &s;acrifice favourite pur&s;uits that promi&s;ed great glory, pur&s;uits in which acknowledged genius had qualified an ambitious &s;pirit to excel; if to &s;acrifice the&s;e to irk&s;ome di&s;putes, from a &s;en&s;e of what he owed to the exi|gencies of his country; if &s;uch conduct de&s;erve, as it a&s;&s;uredly does, the name of public virtue, it may be as difficult, per|haps, to find an equal to Milton in genuine patrioti&s;m as in poetical power: for who can be &s;aid to have &s;acrificed &s;o much, or to have &s;hewn a firmer affection to the public good? If he mi&s;took the mode of promoting it; if his &s;en|timents, both on eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil policy, are &s;uch as the majority of our countrymen think it ju&s;t and wi&s;e to reject, let us give him the credit he de&s;erves for the merit of his intention; let us re&s;pect, as we ought to do, the pro|bity of an exalted under&s;tanding, animated by a fervent, &s;teady, and laudable de&s;ire to enlighten mankind, and to render them more virtuous and happy.</P>
<P>In the year 1640, when Milton returned to England, the current of popular opinion ran with great vehemence again&s;t epi&s;copacy. He was prepared to catch the &s;pirit of the time, and to become an advocate for eccle&s;ia&s;tical reforma|tion, by having peculiar and dome&s;tic grounds of complaint again&s;t religious oppre&s;&s;ion.

The ar|dour of his affections con&s;pired with the warmth of his fancy to enflame him with that puritanical zeal, which blazes &s;o inten&s;ely in his controver&s;ial productions: no le&s;s than four of the&s;e were publi&s;hed within two years after his return; and he thus &s;peaks of the motives, that led him to this &s;pe|cies of compo&s;ition, in his Second Defence.</P>

<P>I have in&s;erted this pa&s;&s;age at full length, becau&s;e it gives us a clear in&s;ight into the motives of Milton on his fir&s;t en|gaging in controver&s;y, and di&s;covers the high opinion which he entertained, both of the chri&s;tian purity and the argumen|tative powers of his own cultivated mind: the two bi&s;hops to whom he alludes were, Hall bi&s;hop of Norwich, famous as our fir&s;t &s;atiri&s;t, and the learned U&s;her, primate of Ire|land. Hall publi&s;hed, in 1640, "An humble Remon&s;trance to the High Court of Parliament in Behalf of Epi&s;copacy"&mdash;

an an&s;wer to this appeared written by &s;ix mini&s;ters, under the title of Smectymnuus, a word ca&s;ually formed from the initial letters of their re&s;pective names. This little band of religious writers included Thomas Young, the beloved pre|ceptor of Milton; &s;o that per&s;onal attachment con&s;pired with public enthu&s;ia&s;m to make our author vehement in his re|ply to the two bi&s;hops, who failed not to encounter the con|federate antagoni&s;ts of their order. He probably recollected the &s;ufferings of his favourite in&s;tructor, when he exclaimed in his treati&s;e of reformation, "What numbers of faithful and free born Engli&s;hmen and good chri&s;tians have been con&s;trained to for&s;ake their deare&s;t home, their friends and kindred, whom nothing but the wide ocean, or the &s;avage de&s;erts of America, could hide and &s;helter from the fury of the bi&s;hops."</P>
<P>However furious the per&s;ecution might be, which ex|cited antipathy and abhorrence in Milton again&s;t the order of bi&s;hops, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that he frequently &s;peaks with that intemperance of zeal, which defeats its own pur|po&s;e. There are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in his controver&s;ial writings, that mu&s;t be read with concern by his mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate ad|mirers; yet even the gloom and &s;everity of the&s;e are com|pen&s;ated by &s;uch occa&s;ional fla&s;hes of ardent fancy, of &s;ound argument, and of &s;ublime devotion, as may extort commen|dation even from readers who love not the author.</P>
<P>In his fir&s;t Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Treati&s;e of Reformation, he makes the following very &s;olemn appeal to heaven on his integrity as a writer: <Q>And here withal I invoke the immortal deity, revealer and judge of &s;ecrets, that wherever I have

<P>Towards the clo&s;e of this performance he gives a di&s;|tant my&s;terious hint of his great and un&s;ettled poetical de|&s;igns, with a very &s;triking mixture of moral, political, and religious enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>

The occupation, however it might &s;u&s;pend his poetical enterprizes, cheri&s;hed the ardour and energy of his mind, and, above all, confirmed in him that well founded and upright &s;elf-e&s;teem, to which we are princi|pally indebted for his &s;ublime&s;t production. The works I allude to were, in his own e&s;timation, indi&s;pen&s;able and meritorious; had he not written them, as he frankly informs us, <Q>he would have heard within him&s;elf, all his life after, of di&s;courage and reproach.</Q> Nothing, perhaps, but this retro&s;pect on a life pa&s;&s;ed, as his own con&s;cience a&s;&s;ured him, in the faithful di&s;charge of arduous and irk|&s;ome duties, could have afforded to the declining days of Milton that confident vigour of mind, that inten&s;e and inex|tingui&s;hable fire of imagination, which gave exi&s;tence and perfection to his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</P>

It is my firm belief, that as this is more known, it will become more and more an object of affection and applau&s;e; yet I am far from &s;urveying it with that blind idolatry, which &s;ees no defect, or with that in|di&s;creet partiality, which labours to hide the failing it di&s;|covers; a biographer mu&s;t have ill under&s;tood the nature of Milton, who could &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible to gratify his &s;pirit by homage &s;o unworthy; for my own part, I am per|&s;uaded his attachment to truth was as &s;incere and fervent as that of the hone&s;t Montaigne, who &s;ays, <Q>I would come again with all my heart from the other world to give any one the lie, who &s;hould report me other than I was, though he did it to honour me.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not therefore attempt to deny or to excu&s;e the fatiguing heavine&s;s or the coar&s;e a&s;perity of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;putes. The &s;incere&s;t friends of Milton may here agree with John&s;on, who &s;peaks of his controver&s;ial merriment as di&s;|gu&s;ting; but when the critic adds, &s;uch is his malignity, that "Hell grows darker at his frown," they mu&s;t abhor

this ba&s;e mi&s;application, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, this profana|tion, of Miltonic ver&s;e.</P>
<P>In a controver&s;ial treati&s;e that gave ri&s;e to &s;uch an impu|tation, we &s;hould expect to find the polemic &s;avagely thir&s;t|ing for the blood of his adver&s;aries: it is ju&s;t the rever&s;e. Milton's antagoni&s;t had, indeed, &s;ugge&s;ted to the public, with <HI>infernal malignity,</HI> that he was a mi&s;creant, <Q>who ought, in the name of Chri&s;t, to be &s;toned to death.</Q> This antagoni&s;t, as Milton &s;uppo&s;ed, was a &s;on of bi&s;hop Hall," and &s;crupled not to write thus outrageou&s;ly again&s;t one, who (to u&s;e the milder words of our author) <Q>in all his writing &s;pake not that any man's &s;kin &s;hould be razed.</Q></P>
<P>"The &s;tyle of his piece," &s;ays John&s;on, in &s;peaking of this apology, <Q>is rough, and &s;uch, perhaps, is that of his an|tagoni&s;t.</Q> The different degrees of roughne&s;s that the two writers di&s;played give a &s;ingular effect to this ob&s;erva|tion of the critic, who confounds the coar&s;e and intemperate vehemence of the one with the outrageous barbarity of the other. Milton &s;ometimes wrote with the unguarded and ungraceful a&s;perity of a man in wrath; but let equity add, that when he did &s;o, he was exa&s;perated by foes, who ex|erted again&s;t him all the per&s;ecuting ferocity of a fiend.</P>
<P>The incidents of his life were calculated to put his tem|per and his fortitude to the mo&s;t arduous trials, and in the &s;evere&s;t of the&s;e he will be found con&s;tant and exemplary in the exerci&s;e of gentle and beneficent virtue. From the thorns of controver&s;y he was plunged into the &s;till &s;harper thorns of connubial di&s;&s;en&s;ion. During the Whit&s;untide of
<PB N="77" REF="98">
the year 1643, at the age of thirty-five, he married Mary, the daughter of Richard Powell, a gentleman who re&s;ided at Fore&s;t Hill, near Shotover, in Oxford&s;hire. This ill-&s;tarr'd union might ari&s;e from an infantine acquaintance, as the grandfather of Milton had probably lived very near the &s;eat of the Powells. What led to the connection we can only conjecture, but we know it was unhappy, as the lady, after living only a few weeks with her hu&s;band in London, de|&s;erted him, under the decent pretence of pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ummer months on a vi&s;it to her father, with whom the indulgent poet gave her permi&s;&s;ion to remain till Michaelmas: during the interval he was engaged in kind attention to his father, whom he now e&s;tabli&s;hed under his own roof. The old man had been &s;ettled at Reading, with his younger &s;on Chri&s;topher, a lawyer and a royali&s;t, but thought it expe|dient to quit that place on its being taken by E&s;&s;ex, the parliamentary general, and found a comfortable a&s;ylum for the re&s;idue of his long life in the filial piety and tender protection of the poet.</P>
<P>At the time appointed, Milton &s;olicited the return of his wife; &s;he did not conde&s;cend even to an&s;wer his letter: he repeated his reque&s;t by a me&s;&s;enger, who, to the be&s;t of my remembrance (&s;ays Philips) reported, that he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with &s;ome &s;ort of contempt. This proceeding, in all pro|bability (continues the biographer, who&s;e &s;ituation made him the be&s;t judge of occurrences &s;o extraordinary) was grounded <Q>upon no other cau&s;e but this, namely, that the family, being generally addicted to the cavalier party, as they called it, and &s;ome of them po&s;&s;ibly engaged in the
<PB N="78" REF="99">
king's &s;ervice, who by this time had his head-quarters at Oxford, and was in &s;ome pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, they began to repent them of having matched the elde&s;t daugh|ter of the family to a per&s;on &s;o contrary to them in opi|nion, and thought it would be a blot in their e&s;cutcheon whenever that Court came to flouri&s;h again; however, it &s;o incen&s;ed our author, that he thought it would be di&s;honourable ever to receive her again after &s;uch a repul&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Milton had too tender and too elevated a &s;pirit not to feel this affront with double poignancy, as it affected both his happine&s;s and his dignity; but it was one of his noble characteri&s;tics to find his mental powers rather invigorated than enfeebled by injury and affliction: he thought it the prerogative of wi&s;dom to find remedies again&s;t every evil, however unexpected, by which vice or infirmity can embit|ter life. In reflecting on his immediate dome&s;tic trouble, he conceived the generous de&s;ign of making it &s;ub&s;ervient to the public good. He found that in di&s;cordant marriage there is mi&s;ery, for which he thought there exi&s;ted a very ea&s;y remedy, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent both with rea&s;on and religion: with the&s;e ideas he publi&s;hed, in 1644, the Doc|trine and Di&s;cipline of Divorce. He addre&s;&s;es the work to the Parliament, with great &s;pirit and eloquence, and after a&s;&s;erting the purity of his precepts, and the beneficence of his de&s;ign, he &s;ays, with patriotic exultation, <Q>let not England forget her precedence of teaching nations how to live.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="100">Sanguine as Milton was in the hope of promoting the virtue and happine&s;s of private life by this publication, the Pre&s;byterian clergy, notwith&s;tanding their pa&s;t obligations to the author, endeavoured to per&s;ecute him for the novelty and freedom of his &s;entiments." The a&s;&s;embly of divines, <Q>&s;itting at We&s;tmin&s;ter, impatient, &s;ays Antony Wood, of having the clergy's juri&s;diction, as they reckoned it, invaded, did, in&s;tead of an&s;wering or di&s;proving what tho&s;e books had a&s;&s;erted, cau&s;e him to be &s;ummoned be|fore the Hou&s;e of Lords; but that hou&s;e, whether approv|ing the doctrine, or not favouring his accu&s;ers, did &s;oon di&s;mi&s;s him.</Q></P>
<P>Milton, whom no oppo&s;ition could intimidate when he believed him&s;elf engaged in the cau&s;e of truth and ju&s;tice, endeavoured to &s;upport his doctrine by &s;ub&s;equent publica|tions; fir&s;t, "The Judgment of Martin Bucer concerning Divorce;" this al&s;o he addre&s;&s;es to the Parliament, and &s;ays, with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, <Q>God, it &s;eems, intended to prove me, whether I dur&s;t alone take up a rightful cau&s;e again&s;t a world of di&s;e&s;teem, and found I dur&s;t. My name I did not publi&s;h, as not willing it &s;hould &s;way the reader either for me or again&s;t me; but when I was told that the &s;tile (which what it ails to be &s;o &s;oon di&s;tin|gui&s;hable I cannot tell) was known by mo&s;t men, and that &s;ome of the clergy began to inveigh and exclaim on what I was credibly informed they had not read, I took it then for my proper &s;ea&s;on, both to &s;hew them a name that could ea&s;ily contemn &s;uch an indi&s;creet kind of cen|&s;ure, and to reinforce the que&s;tion with a more accurate diligence; that if any of them would be &s;o good as to

<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions di&s;play the frankne&s;s and fortitude of a noble mind, perfectly con&s;cious of its own integrity, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a very delicate point, that materially affects the comfort of human life. This integrity he had indeed pro|te&s;ted very &s;olemnly in his former Addre&s;s to the Parliament, where, after a&s;&s;erting that the &s;ubject concerned them chiefly as redre&s;&s;ers of grievances, he proceeds thus, <Q>Me it con|cerns next, having, with much labour and faithful diligence, fir&s;t found out, or at lea&s;t with a fearle&s;s communicative candour fir&s;t publi&s;hed, to the manife&s;t good of chri&s;ten|dom, that which, calling to witne&s;s every thing mortal and immortal, I believe unfeignedly to be true.</Q> The &s;olemnity of this prote&s;tation, confirmed as it was by the &s;ingular regularity of his morals, and the &s;incerity of his zeal as a chri&s;tian, could not &s;ecure him from cen&s;ures of every kind, which, vehement as they were, he &s;eems to have de&s;pi&s;ed. His ideas were derided by libertines, and calum|niated by hypocrites and bigots; but, &s;uperior to ridicule and to &s;lander, he proceeded re&s;olutely in what he thought his duty, by &s;hewing how completely his doctrine was con|&s;onant, in his own opinion, to that go&s;pel, which he had &s;e|dulou&s;ly made not only the favourite &s;tudy, but the con&s;tant guide of his life. With this view he publi&s;hed, in 1645, his Tetrachordon, expo&s;itions upon the four chief places of
<PB N="81" REF="102">
&s;cripture, which &s;peak of marriage. He introduces this work by a third Addre&s;s to the Parliament, and, &s;peaking of their ju&s;tice and candour in di&s;daining to think of per&s;e|cuting him for his doctrine, according to the in&s;tigation of his enemies, he expre&s;&s;es his gratitude in the following ani|mated terms: <Q>For which uprightne&s;s and incorrupt re|fu&s;al of what ye were incen&s;ed to, lords and commons (though it were done to ju&s;tice, not to me, and was a peculiar demon&s;tration how far your ways are different from the ra&s;h vulgar) be&s;ides tho&s;e allegiances of oath and duty, which are my public debt to your public la|bours, I have yet a &s;tore of gratitude laid up, which can|not be exhau&s;ted, and &s;uch thanks, perhaps, they may live to be, as &s;hall more than whi&s;per to the next ages.</Q> This &s;entence is remarkable in various points of view, but chiefly as it &s;hews us that the peculiar eagerne&s;s and energy with which Milton, at a future period, defended the parliament, originated not only in his pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to freedom, but in his ardent &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal gratitude to the legi&s;la|ture of his country. He was, however, too magnanimous to wi&s;h for &s;helter under any authority, without vindicating his innocence and the merit of his cau&s;e; he therefore &s;ays to the parliament, in &s;peaking of an antagoni&s;t who, in their pre&s;ence, had traduced him from the pulpit, <Q>I &s;hall take licence by the right of nature, and that liberty wherein I was born, to defend my&s;elf publicly again&s;t a printed calumny, and do willingly appeal to tho&s;e judges to whom I am accu&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="103">The preacher had repre&s;ented the doctrine of divorce as a wicked book, for allowing other cau&s;es of divorce than Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles mentioned, and the parliament as &s;inners for not puni&s;hing its authors.</P>
<P>This induces Milton to exclaim with devotional &s;pirit, which &s;eems predominant in his mind upon every occa&s;ion, <Q>Fir&s;t, lords and commons, I pray to that God, before whom ye then were pro&s;trate, &s;o to forgive ye tho&s;e omi&s;&s;ions and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, which ye de&s;ire mo&s;t &s;hould find forgivene&s;s, as I &s;hall &s;oon &s;hew to the world how ea&s;ily ye ab&s;olve your&s;elves of that, which this man calls your &s;in, and is indeed your wi&s;dom and noblene&s;s, whereof to this day ye have done well not to repent.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;cope of Milton, in his doctrine of divorce, is thus explained by him&s;elf: <Q>This &s;hall be the ta&s;k and period of this di&s;cour&s;e to prove, fir&s;t, that other rea&s;ons of di|vorce be&s;ides adultery were by the law of Mo&s;es, and are yet to be allowed by the Chri&s;tian magi&s;trate, as a piece of ju&s;tice, and that the words of Chri&s;t are not hereby contraried; next that, to prohibit ab&s;olutely any divorce what&s;oever, except tho&s;e which Mo&s;es excepted, is again&s;t the rea&s;on of law.</Q></P>
<P>This doctrine he fir&s;t delivered as the re&s;ult of his own diligent &s;tudy of the &s;cripture. He afterwards found and declared it con&s;onant to what many eminent divines of the reformed church, particularly Martin Bucer and Era&s;mus, had maintained; la&s;tly, to grace his opinions with the highe&s;t human &s;upport, he a&s;&s;erts, <Q>they were &s;anctioned by the whole a&s;&s;embled authority of England, both church

and &s;tate, and in tho&s;e times which are on record for the pure&s;t and &s;incere&s;t that ever &s;hone yet on the Reforma|tion of this land, the time of Edward the Sixth. That worthy prince, having utterly aboli&s;hed the canon law out of his dominions, as his father did before him, ap|pointed by full vote of parliament a committee of two and thirty cho&s;en men, divines and lawyers, of whom Cranmer the archbi&s;hop, Peter Martyr, and Walter Had|don, not without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir John Cheek, the king's tutor, a man at that time accounted the learnede&s;t of Engli&s;hmen, and for piety not inferior, were the chief to frame anew &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, that might be in&s;tead of what was abrogated. The work with great diligence was fini&s;hed, and with as great approbation of that re|forming age was received, and had been doubtle&s;s, as the learned preface thereof te&s;tifies, e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of par|liament, had not the good king's death &s;o &s;oon en&s;uing arre&s;ted the farther growth of religion al&s;o from that &s;ea&s;on to this. Tho&s;e laws, thus &s;ounded on the memo|rable wi&s;dom and piety of that religious parliament and &s;ynod, allow divorce and &s;econd marriage not only for adultery and de&s;ertion, but for any capital enmity or plot laid again&s;t the other's life, and likewi&s;e for evil and fierce u&s;age. Nay, the twelfth chapter of that title, by plain con&s;equence declares, that le&s;&s;er contentions, if they be perpetual, may obtain divorce, which is all one really with the po&s;ition by me held in the former treati&s;e pub|li&s;hed on this argument, herein only differing, that there the cau&s;e of perpetual &s;trife was put, for example, in the
<PB N="84" REF="105">
unchangeable di&s;cord of &s;ome natures; but in the&s;e laws, intended us by the be&s;t of our ance&s;tors, the effect of continual &s;trife is determined no unju&s;t plea of divorce, whether the cau&s;e be natural or wilful.</Q></P>
<P>The author exults &s;o much in this authority, that he concludes with the following expre&s;&s;ions of confidence and triumph:</P>
<Q>Henceforth let them, who condemn the a&s;&s;ertion of this book for new and licentious, be &s;orry, le&s;t, while they think to be of the graver &s;ort, and take on them to be teachers, they expo&s;e them&s;elves rather to be pledged up and down by men who intimately know them, to the di&s;covery and contempt of their ignorance and pre&s;ump|tion.</Q>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e it occu|pied &s;o deeply the mind and heart of Milton. In the&s;e treati&s;es the energy of his language is very &s;triking; it forcibly proves how keenly he felt the angui&s;h of connu|bial infelicity, and how ardently he laboured to remove from him&s;elf and others that "&s;ecret affliction" (to u&s;e one of his own expre&s;&s;ive phra&s;es) <Q>of an uncon&s;cionable &s;ize to hu|man &s;trength.</Q></P>
<P>He argues, indeed, for what the majority of modern le|gi&s;lators and divines have thought incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound morality and true religion; but they who deem his argu|ments inconclu&s;ive, may yet admire the powers and the probity of the advocate. His view of the que&s;tion is as ex|ten&s;ive and liberal as his intention was pure and benevolent: if a few words of our Saviour, in their literal &s;en&s;e, are

again&s;t him, the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel may be thought, by &s;in|cere Chri&s;tians, to allow him all the latitude for which he contends; the mo&s;t rigid opponent of his doctrine may be frequently charmed with his rich vein of fervid eloquence and chri&s;tian philanthropy.</P>
<P>His three publications on divorce were followed by Co|la&s;terion, a reply to a namele&s;s an&s;wer again&s;t his doctrine. This work is an angry invective, in which he endeavours, but not happily, to overwhelm his antagoni&s;t with ri|dicule.</P>
<P>In the account which he gives of his own compo&s;itions, in his Second Defence, he &s;peaks of his treati&s;e on divorce, as forming a part of his progre&s;&s;ive labour to vindicate liberty in various points of view; he con&s;idered it in three dif|ferent &s;hapes, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, dome&s;tic, and civil; he thought it of high moment to e&s;tabli&s;h a more enlarged &s;y&s;tem of dome&s;tic liberty, at a time when connubial di&s;cord was &s;o common, in con&s;equence of civil di&s;&s;en&s;ion; when, to u&s;e his own forcible expre&s;&s;ion, alluding probably to his parti|cular &s;ituation, <Q>the wife might be found in the camp of the enemy, threatening ruin and &s;laughter to her hu&s;|band.</Q> He &s;eems to exult in &s;aying, that his doctrine of divorce was more abundantly demon&s;trated, about two years after his publication, by the illu&s;trious Selden, in his Uxor Hebraea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum itaque tres omnino animadverterem libertatis es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;pecies, quae ni&s;i ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">int, vita ul|la tran&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> commod&egrave; vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;it, eccle&s;ia&s;ticam, dome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cam, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eu privatam, atque civilem, deque prima jam &s;crip&s;i&s;&s;em, doque tertia magi&s;tratum &s;edulo agere viderem, quae reli|qua &s;ecunda erat, dome&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cam n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i; ea quoque tripartita, cum videretar e&s;le, &s;i res conjug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dis, &s;i liberorum in&s;titutio rect&egrave; &s;e haber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, &s;i denique liber&egrave; philo&s;ophandi po|te&s;tas e&s;&s;et, de conjugio non &s;olum rite con|trahendo, verum etiam, &s;i nece&s;le e&s;&s;et, di&s;|&s;olvendo, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rem explic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i; idque ex divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, quam Chri&s;tus non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ulit, ne|dum alium, tota l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uorem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivi|lite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; quid nem de excepta &s;olum &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntiendum &s;it, et meam aliorum|que &s;ententum expromp&s;i, et clari&s;&s;imus vir Seldenus no&s;ter, in Uxore Hebraea plus mi|n&ugrave;s biennio po&s;t edita, uberius demon&s;travit.

He that changes his party by his hu|mour is not much more virtuous than he that changes it by his intere&s;t; he loves him&s;elf rather than truth.</Q> Notwith&s;tanding the air of morality in this remark, it may be que&s;tioned, if ever an ob&s;ervation was made on any great character more invidious or more unju&s;t. When the Pre&s;|byterians were favoured by Milton, they &s;pake the language of the oppre&s;&s;ed; on their being inve&s;ted with power, they forgot their own pleas for liberty of con&s;cience, and became, in their turn, per&s;ecutors; it was the con&s;i&s;tency of virtue, therefore, in Milton, that made him at one time their advo|cate, and at another their opponent: &s;o far from loving him&s;elf better than truth, he was perhaps of all mortals the lea&s;t &s;elfi&s;h.&mdash;He contended for religion without &s;eeking emoluments from the church; he contended for the &s;tate without aiming at any civil or military employment: truth and ju&s;tice were the idols of his heart and the &s;tudy of his life; if he &s;ometimes failed of attaining them, it was not becau&s;e he loved any thing better; it was becau&s;e he over|&s;hot
<PB N="88" REF="109">
the object of his &s;incere affection from the fondne&s;s and ardour of his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>His wife &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her de&s;ertion, but he amu&s;ed his mind under the mortification her conduct had occa&s;ioned by frequent vi&s;its to the Lady Margaret Ley, who&s;e man|ners and conver&s;ation were peculiarly engaging. Her father, the Earl of Marlborough, had held the highe&s;t offices in a former reign, and of his virtues &s;he u&s;ed to &s;peak with &s;uch filial eloquence as in&s;pired Milton with a &s;onnet in her prai&s;e.</P>
<P>He continued al&s;o to manife&s;t his firm affection to the public good, by two compo&s;itions intended to promote it; the little tractate on education, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Hartlib, who had reque&s;ted his thoughts upon that intere&s;ting &s;ub|ject, and his Areopagitica, a &s;peech for the liberty of un|licenced printing. The latter has been re-printed, with a &s;pirited preface by Thom&s;on, a poet whom a pa&s;&s;ion for freedom, united to genius, had highly qualified as an editor and eulogi&s;t of Milton.</P>
<P>Had the author of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t left us no compo&s;i|tion but his Areopagitica, he would be &s;till entitled to the affectionate veneration of every Engli&s;hman, who exults in that intellectual light, which is the noble&s;t characteri&s;tic of his country, and for which England is chiefly indebted to the liberty of the pre&s;s. Our con&s;tant advocate for free|dom, in every department of life, vindicated this mo&s;t im|portant privilege with a mind fully &s;en&s;ible of its value; he poured all his heart into this vindication, and, to &s;peak of his work in his own energetic language, we may ju&s;tly

<P>His late biographer, in&s;tead of prai&s;ing Milton for a &s;ervice &s;o honourably rendered to literature, &s;eems rather de&s;irous of annihilating its merit, by directing his &s;arca&s;tic animo&s;ity again&s;t the liberty of the pre&s;s. <Q>It &s;eems not more rea|&s;onable,</Q> &s;ays John&s;on, <Q>to leave the right of printing unre&s;trained, becau&s;e writers may be afterwards cen&s;ured, than it would be to &s;leep with doors unbolted, becau&s;e by our laws we can hang a thief.</Q></P>
<P>This is &s;ervile &s;ophi&s;try; the author's illu&s;tration of a thief may be turned again&s;t him&s;elf. To &s;uffer no book to be publi&s;hed without a licence, is tyranny as ab&s;urd as it would be to &s;uffer no traveller to pa&s;s along the highway without producing a certificate that he is not a robber.</P>
<P>Even bad books may have their u&s;e, as Milton ob&s;erves; and I mention this ob&s;ervation, chiefly to &s;hew how liberally he introduces a ju&s;t compliment to a great author of his own time, in &s;upport of this idea. "What better witne&s;s," &s;ays the advocate for unlicenced printing, <Q>can ye expect I &s;hould produce, than one of your own, now &s;itting in par|liament, the chief of learned men reputed in this land, Mr. Selden, who&s;e volume of natural and national laws proves, not only by great authorities brought together, but by exqui&s;ite rea&s;ons and theorems almo&s;t mathematically demon&s;trative, that all opinions, yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of main &s;ervice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to|wards the &s;peedy attainment of what is true&s;t.</Q> This
<PB N="90" REF="111">
eulogy alone appears &s;ufficient to refute a remark unfriendly to Milton, that he was frugal of his prai&s;e; &s;uch frugality will hardly be found united to a benevolent heart and a glowing imagination.</P>
<P>In 1645, his early poems, both Engli&s;h and Latin, were fir&s;t publi&s;hed in a little volume by Humphry Mo&s;ely, who informs the reader in his adverti&s;ement, that he had obtained them by &s;olicitation from the author, regarding him as a &s;ucce&s;sful rival of Spencer.</P>
<P>Milton had now pa&s;&s;ed more than three years in that &s;in|gular &s;tate of mortification, which the di&s;obedience of his wife occa&s;ioned. His time had been occupied by the ince&s;&s;ant exerci&s;e of his mental powers; but he probably felt with peculiar poignancy
<Q>A craving void left aching in the brea&s;t.</Q>
As he entertained &s;erious thoughts of enforcing, by his own example, his doctrine of divorce, and of marrying another wife, who might be worthy of the title, he paid his addre&s;&s;es to the daughter of Doctor Davies: the father &s;eems to have been a convert to Milton's arguments; but the lady had &s;cruples. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, according to Philips, both wit and beauty. A noveli&s;t could hardly imagine circum|&s;tances more &s;ingularly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to &s;en&s;ibility, than the &s;ituation of the poet, if, as we may rea&s;onably conjecture, he was deeply enamoured of this lady; if her father was inclined to accept him as a &s;on-in-law; and if the object of his love had no inclination to reject his &s;uit, but what aro&s;e from a dread of his being indi&s;&s;olubly united to another.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="112">Perhaps Milton alludes to what he felt on this occa&s;ion in tho&s;e affecting lines of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, where Adam, pro|phetically enumerating the mi&s;eries to ari&s;e from woman, &s;ays, in clo&s;ing the melancholy li&s;t, that man &s;ometimes

<P>However &s;trong the &s;cruples of his new favourite might have been, it &s;eems not improbable that he would have tri|umphed over them, had not an occurrence, which has the air of an incident in romance, given another turn to the emotions of his heart. While he was conver&s;ing with a re|lation, whom he frequently vi&s;ited in St. Martin's-lane, the door of an adjoining apartment was &s;uddenly opened: he beheld his repentant wife kneeling at his feet, and imploring his forgivene&s;s.

<P>Fenton ju&s;tly remarks, that the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion which this interview mu&s;t have made on Milton <Q>contributed much to the painting of that pathetic &s;cene in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, in which Eve addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to Adam for pardon

<P>It has been &s;aid, that Milton re&s;embled his own Adam in the comeline&s;s of his per&s;on; but he &s;eems to have re|&s;embled him &s;till more in much nobler endowments, and particularly in uniting great tenderne&s;s of heart to equal dignity of mind. Soon after he had pardoned, and lived again with his wife, he afforded an a&s;ylum, in his own hou&s;e, to both her parents, and to their numerous family. They were active royali&s;ts, and fell into great di&s;tre&s;s by the ruin of their party: the&s;e were the per&s;ons who had not only treated Milton with contemptuous pride, but had imbittered his exi&s;tence for four years, by in&s;tigating his wife to per&s;i&s;t in de&s;erting him. The mother, as Wood intimates, was his greate&s;t enemy, and occa&s;ioned the perver&s;e conduct of her daughter. The father, though &s;umptuous in his mode of life when he fir&s;t received Milton as his &s;on-in-law, had
<PB N="93" REF="114">
never paid the marriage portion of a thou&s;and pounds, ac|cording to his agreement, and was now &s;tript of his property by the prevalence of the party he had oppo&s;ed. On per&s;ons thus contumelious and culpable towards him, Milton be|&s;towed his favour and protection. Can the records of pri|vate life exhibit a more magnanimous example of forgivene&s;s and beneficence?</P>
<P>At the time of his wife's unexpected return, he was pre|paring to remove from Alder&s;gate to a larger hou&s;e in Bar|bican, with a view of increa&s;ing the number of his &s;cholars. It was in this new man&s;ion that he received the forgiven penitent, and provided a refuge for her relations, whom he retained under his roof, according to Fenton, <Q>till their affairs were accommodated by his intere&s;t with the victo|rious party.</Q></P>
<P>They left him &s;oon after the death of his father, who ended a very long life, in the year 1647, and not without the gratification, peculiarly &s;oothing to an affectionate old man, of be&s;towing his benediction on a grand-child; for, within the year of Milton's re-union with his wife, his family was increa&s;ed by a daughter, Anne, the elde&s;t of his children, born July 29th, 1646.</P>
<P>When his apartments were no longer occupied by the gue&s;ts, whom he had &s;o generou&s;ly received, he admitted more &s;cholars; but their number was &s;mall, and Philips imagines, that he was induced to withdraw him&s;elf from the bu&s;ine&s;s of education by a pro&s;pect of being appointed ad|jutant general in Sir William Waller's army: whatever might have been the motive for his change of life, he quit|ted
<PB N="94" REF="115">
his large hou&s;e in Barbican for a &s;maller in Holborn, <Q>among tho&s;e (&s;ays his nephew) that open backwards into Lincoln's Inn Fields,</Q> where he lived, according to the &s;ame author, in great privacy, and perpetually engaged in a variety of &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Three years elap&s;ed without any new publication from his pen; a &s;ilence which the various affecting occurrences in his family would naturally produce. In 1649 he publi&s;hed The Tenure of Kings and Magi&s;trates; and in his &s;um|mary account of his own writings, he relates the time and occa&s;ion of this performance.

<P><PB N="100" REF="121">A writer of a &s;anguine imagination, who delineates a public character he admires in the glowing colours of affection, has rarely the good fortune to find the per&s;onage whom he has prai&s;ed acting in perfect conformity to his panegyric; but Milton, in one particular circum&s;tance, had this rare felicity, in regard to the friend whom he &s;o fer|vently commended; for Brad&s;haw re&s;i&s;ted the tyrannical orders of Cromwell, in the plenitude of his power, with &s;uch firmne&s;s, that we might almo&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him animated by a de&s;ire to act up to the letter of the eulogy, with which he had been honoured by the eloquence and the e&s;teem of Milton. This will &s;ufficiently appear by the following anecdote in Ludlow's Memoirs, who, after &s;peaking of Oli|ver's u&s;urpation, and the univer&s;al terror he in&s;pired, relates how he him&s;elf was &s;ummoned, with Brad&s;haw, Sir Henry Vane, and colonel Rich, to appear before the u&s;urper in council. <Q>Cromwell (&s;ays Ludlow) as &s;oon as he &s;aw the lord pre&s;ident, required him to take out a new com|mi&s;&s;ion for his office of chief ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, which he refu&s;ed, alledging that he held that place by a grant from the parliament of England, to continue, 'quamdiu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erit;' and whether he had carried him&s;elf with that integrity, which his commi&s;&s;ion exacted, he was ready to &s;ubmit to a trial by twelve Engli&s;hmen, to be cho&s;en even by Cromwell him&s;elf.</Q></P>

the pre&s;ident ju&s;tly incurred in the trial of Charles &s;eems to have prevented even our liberal hi&s;torians from record|ing with candour the great qualities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: he was undoubtedly not only an intrepid but a &s;incere enthu&s;ia&s;t in the cau&s;e of the commonwealth. His di&s;cour&s;e on his death-bed is a &s;anction to his &s;incerity; he regarded it as meritorious to have pronounced &s;entence on his king, in tho&s;e awful moments when he was pa&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the tribunal of his God. Whatever we may think of his po|litical tenets, let us render ju&s;tice to the courage and the con&s;i&s;tency with which he &s;upported them.&mdash;The mind of Milton was in uni&s;on with the high-toned &s;pirit of this re|&s;olute friend, and we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee how little ground there is to accu&s;e the poet of &s;ervility to Cromwell; but we have fir&s;t to notice the regular &s;eries of his political com|po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Soon after his public appointment, he was reque&s;ted by the council to counteract the effect of the celebrated book, entitled, Icon Ba&s;ilike, the Royal Image, and in 1649 he publi&s;hed his Iconocla&s;tes, the Image Breaker. The &s;aga|city of Milton enabled him to di&s;cover, that the pious work imputed to the decea&s;ed king was a political artifice to &s;erve the cau&s;e of the royali&s;ts; but as it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to obtain &s;uch evidence to detect the impo&s;ition as time has &s;ince produced, he executed a regular reply to the book, as a real production of the king, intimating at the &s;ame time his &s;u&s;picion of the fraud.</P>

His &s;evere biographer &s;inks the name of his own old and di&s;honourable a&s;&s;ociate in de|preciating Milton, and does not inform us that it was the in|famous Lauder, who, having failed to bla&s;t the reputation of the poet, with equal impotence and fury pur&s;ued his attack again&s;t the probity of the man in an execrable pamphlet entitled <Q>King Charles the Fir&s;t vindicated from the Charge of Plagiari&s;m brought again&s;t him by Milton, and Milton him&s;elf convicted of Forgery.</Q> In&s;tead of naming Lauder, who per&s;i&s;ted in trying to &s;ub&s;tantiate this mo&s;t improbable charge, John&s;on would in&s;idiou&s;ly lead us to believe, that

the re&s;pectable Dr. Birch &s;upported it, though Birch, who had indeed printed, in the appendix to his Life of Milton, the idle &s;tory which Lauder urges as a proof of Milton's impo&s;ture, had properly rejected that &s;tory from the im|proved edition of his work, and honourably united with another candid biographer of the poet, the learned bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, in declaring that <Q>&s;uch contemptible evidence is not to be admitted again&s;t a man, who had a &s;oul above being guilty of &s;o mean an action.</Q></P>
<P>There are &s;ome calumnies &s;o utterly de&s;picable and ab|&s;urd, that to refute them elaborately is almo&s;t a di&s;grace: did not the calumny I am now &s;peaking of belong to this de&s;cription, it might be here ob&s;erved, that a writer who publi&s;hed remarks on John&s;on's Life of Milton, in which the a&s;perity of that biographer is oppo&s;ed with &s;uperior a&s;perity, has proved, with new arguments, the futility of the charge in que&s;tion. In&s;tead of repeating the&s;e, let me ob|&s;erve, that the attempt of John&s;on to revive a ba&s;e and &s;uffi|ciently refuted imputation again&s;t the great author who&s;e life he was writing, is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary proofs that literature can exhibit how far the virulence of political ha|tred may pervert a very powerful mind, even a mind which makes moral truth its principal pur&s;uit, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly la|bours to be ju&s;t. This remark is not made in enmity to John&s;on, but to &s;hew how cautious the mo&s;t cultivated under&s;tanding &s;hould be in watching the influence of any ho&s;tile prejudice. Milton him&s;elf may be al&s;o urged as an example to enforce the &s;ame caution; for though he was certainly no impo&s;tor in imputing the prayer in que&s;tion to
<PB N="104" REF="125">
the king, yet his con&s;idering the king's u&s;e of it as an of|fence again&s;t heaven, is a pitiable ab&s;urdity; an ab&s;urdity as glaring as it would be to affirm, that the divine poet is him|&s;elf profane in a&s;&s;igning to a &s;peech of the Almighty, in his poem, the two following ver&s;es:

Chri&s;tina, when he appeared as her eulogi&s;t, was the idol of the literary world. The candour with which &s;he &s;pake as a queen on his defence of the people would naturally &s;trike the author as an engaging proof of her di&s;cernment and magnanimity; he was al&s;o gratified in no common degree by the coolne&s;s with which &s;he treated his adver&s;ary; for Salma&s;ius, whom &s;he had in|vited to her court for his erudition, was known to have lo&s;t her favour, when his literary arrogance and imbecility were expo&s;ed and cha&s;ti&s;ed by the indignant &s;pirit or Milton.

defence appeared, that &s;everal friends advi&s;ed Milton not to hazard his credit again&s;t a name &s;o eminent as that of Salma&s;uis, Never did a literary conflict engage the atten|tion of a wider circle; and never did victory declare more decidedly in favour of the party from whom the public had lea&s;t expectation. Perhaps no author ever acquired a more rapid and exten&s;ive celebrity than Milton gained by this conte&s;t. Let us however remark, for the intere&s;t of litera|ture, that the two combatants were both to blame in their reciprocal u&s;e of weapons utterly unworthy of the great cau&s;e that each had to &s;u&s;tain; not content to wield the broad and bright &s;word of national argument, they both de&s;cended to u&s;e the mean and envenomed dagger of per|&s;onal malevolence. They have indeed great authorities of modern time to plead in their excu&s;e, not to men|tion the bitter di&s;putants or antiquity. It was the opinion of John&s;on, and Milton him&s;elf &s;eems to have entertained the &s;ame idea, that it is allowable in literary contention to ridicule, vilify, and depreciate as much as po&s;&s;ible the cha|racter of an opponent. Surely this doctrine is unworthy of the great names who have endeavoured to &s;upport it, both in theory and practice; a doctrine not only morally wrong, but prudentially defective; for a malevolent &s;pirit in elo|quence is like a dangerous varni&s;h in painting, which may produce, indeed, a brilliant and forcible effect for a time, but ultimately injures the &s;ucce&s;s of the production; a re|mark that may be verified in peru&s;ing the Latin pro&s;e of Milton, where elegance of language and energy of &s;entiment

<P>It is a plea&s;ing tran&s;ition to return from his enemies to his friends. He had a mind and heart peculiarly alive to the duties and delights of friend&s;hip, and &s;eems to have been peculiarly happy in this important article of human life. In &s;peaking of his blindne&s;s, he mentions, in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting manner, the a&s;&s;iduous and tender attention, which he re|ceived on that occa&s;ion from his friends in general; &s;ome of them he regarded as not inferior in kindne&s;s to The&s;eus and Pylades, the ancient demigods of amity. We have lo&s;t, perhaps, &s;ome little poems that flowed from the heart of Milton, by their being addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons who, in the vici&s;&s;itudes of public fortune, were &s;uddenly plunged into ob&s;curity with the honours they had received.

Overton is commended by the frank ingenuous Ludlow as a brave and faithful officer; he is al&s;o ridiculed in a ballad of the royali&s;ts as a religious enthu&s;ia&s;t. He had a gratuity of 300l. a year conferred on him for his bravery by the parliament, and had ri&s;en to the rank of a major general. Cromwell, apprehen&s;ive that Overton was con&s;piring again&s;t his u&s;urpation, fir&s;t impri&s;oned him in the tower, and after|wards confined him in the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey. A letter, in which Marvel relates to Milton his having pre&s;ented to the Protector at Wind&s;or a recent copy of the Second Defence, expre&s;&s;es at the &s;ame time an affectionate curio&s;ity concern|ing the bu&s;ine&s;s of Overton, who was at that time ju&s;t brought to London by a my&s;terious order of Cromwell. He did not e&s;cape from confinement till after the death of Oliver, when, in con&s;equence of a petition from his &s;i&s;ter to the parliament, he obtained his relea&s;e. Soon after the re&s;toration, he was again impri&s;oned in the Tower with Colonel De&s;borow, on a rumour of their being concerned in a trea&s;onable commotion; but as that rumour &s;eems to have been a political device of the royali&s;ts, contrived to &s;trengthen the new government, he probably regained his freedom, though we know not how his active days were concluded.

<P>As I have cheri&s;hed from my childhood (if ever mor|tal did) a reverential fondne&s;s for the Grecian name, and
<PB N="116" REF="137">
for your native Athens in particular, &s;o have I continually per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that at &s;ome period I &s;hould receive from that city a very &s;ignal return for my benevolent regard: nor has the ancient genius of your mo&s;t noble country &s;ailed to realize my pre&s;age; he has given me in you an Attic bro|ther, and one mo&s;t tenderly attached to me. Though I was known to you only by my writings, and though your re&s;i|dence was far di&s;tant from mine, you fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed me in the mo&s;t engaging terms by letter; and afterwards coming unexpectedly to London, and vi&s;iting the &s;tranger, who had no eyes to &s;ee you, continued your kindne&s;s to me under that calamity, which can render me a more eligible friend
<PB N="117" REF="138">
to no one, and to many, perhaps, may make me an object of di&s;regard.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, you reque&s;t me not to reject all hope of recovering my &s;ight, as you have an intimate friend at Paris, in Thevenot the phy&s;ician, who excels particularly in relieving ocular complaints, and whom you wi&s;h to con&s;ult concerning my eyes, after receiving from me &s;uch an ac|count as may enable him to under&s;tand the &s;ource and &s;ymptoms of my di&s;order, I will certainly follow your kind &s;ugge&s;tion, that I may not appear to reject a&s;&s;i&s;tance thus offered me, perhaps providentially.</P>
<P>It is about ten years, I think, &s;ince I perceived my &s;ight to grow weak and dim, finding at the &s;ame time my inte&s;tines afflicted with flatulence and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Even in the morning, if I began as u&s;ual to read, my eyes immediately &s;uffered pain, and &s;eemed to &s;hrink from reading, but, after &s;ome moderate bodily exerci&s;e, were re|fre&s;hed; whenever I looked at a candle I &s;aw a &s;ort of iris around it. Not long afterwards, on the left &s;ide of my left eye (which began to fail &s;ome years before the other) a darkne&s;s aro&s;e, that hid from me all things on that &s;ide;&mdash;if I chanced to clo&s;e my right eye, whatever was before me &s;eemed dimini&s;hed.&mdash;In the la&s;t three years, as my remain|ing eye failed by degrees &s;ome months before my &s;ight was utterly gone, all things that I could di&s;cern, though I moved not my&s;elf, appeared to &s;luctate, now to the right, now to the left. Ob&s;tinate vapours &s;eem to have &s;ettled all over my forehead and my temples, overwhelming my eyes with a &s;ort of &s;leepy heavine&s;s, e&s;pecially after food, till the
<PB N="118" REF="139">
evening; &s;o that I frequently recollect the condition of the prophet Phineus in the Argonautics:
<Q><L>Him vapours dark</L>
<L>Envelop'd, and the earth appeared to roll</L>
<L>Beneath him, &s;inking in a lifele&s;s trance.</L></Q>
But I &s;hould not omit to &s;ay, that while I had &s;ome little &s;ight remaining, as &s;oon as I went to bed, and reclined on either &s;ide, a copious light u&s;ed to dart from my clo&s;ed eyes; then, as my &s;ight grew daily le&s;s, darker colours &s;eemed to bur&s;t forth with vehemence, and a kind of internal noi&s;e; but now, as if every thing lucid were extingui&s;hed, black|ne&s;s, either ab&s;olute or chequered, and interwoven as it were with a&s;h-colour, is accu&s;tomed to pour it&s;elf on my eyes; yet the darkne&s;s perpetually before them, as well during the night as in the day, &s;eems always approaching rather to white than to black, admitting, as the eye rolls, a minute portion of light as through a crevice.</P>
<P>Though from your phy&s;ician &s;uch a portion of hope al&s;o may ari&s;e, yet, as under an evil that admits no cure, I regulate and tranquilize my mind, often reflecting, that &s;ince the days of darkne&s;s allotted to each, as the wi&s;e man reminds us, are many, hitherto my darkne&s;s, by the &s;ingular mercy of God, with the aid of &s;tudy, lei&s;ure, and the kind conver&s;ation of my friends, is much le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive than the deadly darkne&s;s to which he alludes. For if, as it is written, man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God, why &s;hould not a
<PB N="119" REF="140">
man acquie&s;ce even in this? not thinking that he can derive light from his eyes alone, but e&s;teeming him&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently enlightened by the conduct or providence of God.</P>
<P>As long, therefore, as he looks forward, and provides for me as he does, and leads me backward and forward by the hand, as it were, through my whole life, &s;hall I not cheerfully bid my eyes keep holiday, &s;ince &s;uch appears to be his plea&s;ure? But whatever may be the event of your kindne&s;s, my dear Philaras, with a mind not le&s;s re&s;olute and firm than if I were Lynceus him&s;elf, I bid you fare|well.</P>

<P>We have no rea&s;on to imagine that Milton received any kind of medical benefit from the friendly intention of this amiable foreigner. Strange as the idea may at fir&s;t appear, perhaps it was better for him, as a man and as a poet, to remain without a cure; for his devout tenderne&s;s and energy of mind had &s;o far converted his calamity into a ble&s;&s;ing, that it &s;eems rather to have promoted than ob|&s;tructed both the happine&s;s of his life and the perfection of his genius. We have &s;een, in the admirable &s;onnet on his blindne&s;s, how his reflections on the con&s;cientious labour by which he lo&s;t his eyes gave a dignified &s;atisfaction to his &s;pirit.

His left eye became utterly blind in 1651, the year in which the book that he alludes to was publi&s;hed, and he lo&s;t the u&s;e of the other in 1654, the year in which he wrote concerning his blindne&s;s to his Athenian friend.

<P>Philips al&s;o informs us, that while his uncle lodged at Thom&s;on's he was employed in revi&s;ing and poli&s;hing the Latin work of his younge&s;t nephew John, who, on the publication of a &s;evere attack upon Milton, a&s;cribed to Bramhall, Bi&s;hop of Derry, vindicated his illu&s;trious rela|tion, and &s;atirized his &s;uppo&s;ed adver&s;ary with a keenne&s;s and vehemence of invective, which induced, perhaps, &s;ome readers to &s;u&s;pect that the performance was written entirely by Milton. The traces, however, of a young hand are evi|dent in the work; and John Philips, at the time it ap|peared, 1652, was a youth of nineteen or twenty, eager (as he declares) to engage un&s;olicited in a compo&s;ition, which, however abounding in juvenile defects, proves him attached to his country, and grateful to his friends.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="144">In 1654, Milton, now utterly blind, appeared again in the field of controver&s;y, fir&s;t, in his Second Defence of the Engli&s;h People, and the following year in a defence of him&s;elf, "Autoris pro &s;e Defen&s;io." The fir&s;t of the&s;e productions is in truth his own vindication; it is the work in which he &s;peaks mo&s;t abundantly of his own character and conduct; it di&s;plays that true eloquence of the heart, by which probity and talents are enabled to defeat the malevolence of an in&s;olent accu&s;er; it proves that the mind of this wonderful man united to the poetic imagination of Homer the argumentative energy of Demo&s;thenes.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be allowed, that while Milton defended him&s;elf with the &s;pirit of the Grecian orator, in imitating the eloquent Athenian he promi&s;cuou&s;ly caught both his merits and defects. It is to be regretted, that the&s;e mighty ma&s;ters of rhetoric permitted &s;o large an alloy of per&s;onal virulence to deba&s;e the dignity of national argument; yet as the great orators of an age more humanized are apt, we &s;ee, to be hurried into the &s;ame failing, we may conclude that it is almo&s;t in&s;eparable from the weakne&s;s of nature, and we mu&s;t not expect to find, though we certainly &s;hould endea|vour to introduce, the charity of the Go&s;pel in political contention.</P>

thunders of the eloquent Athenian are &s;ufficiently known. The indignation of Milton was awakened by a Latin work, publi&s;hed at the Hague in 1652, entitled, "Regii San|guinis Clamor ad Caelum;" The Cry of Royal Blood to Heaven. In this book all the bitter terms of abhorrence and reproach, with which the malignity of pa&s;&s;ion can di&s;|honour learning, were lavi&s;hed on the eloquent defender of the Engli&s;h commonwealth. The &s;ecret author of this &s;cur|rility was Peter du Moulin, a Prote&s;tant divine, and &s;on of a French author, whom the biographers of his own country de&s;cribe as a &s;atiri&s;t without ta&s;te and a theologian without temper. Though du Moulin &s;eems to have inherited the acrimonious &s;pirit of his father, he had not the courage to publi&s;h him&s;elf what he had written as the antagoni&s;t of Milton, but &s;ent his papers to Salma&s;ius, who entru&s;ted them to Alexander More, a French prote&s;tant of Scotch ex|traction, and a divine, who agreed in his principles with the author of the manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t unfortunately for his own future comfort, More publi&s;hed, without a name, the work of Du Moulin, with a dedication to Charles the Second, under the &s;ignature of Ulac, the Dutch printer. He decorated the book with a portrait of Charles, and applied at the &s;ame time to Milton the Virgilian delineation of Polypheme:
<Q><L>Mon&s;trum horrendum in&s;orme ingens, cui lumen ademptum.</L>
<L>A mon&s;trous bulk deform'd, depriv'd of &s;ight.</L>
<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="125" REF="146">
Never was a &s;avage in&s;ult more completely avenged; for Milton, having di&s;covered that More was unque&s;tionably the publi&s;her of the work, con&s;idered him as its author, which, according to legal maxims, he had a right to do, and in return expo&s;ed, with &s;uch &s;everity of reproof, the irregular and licentious life of his adver&s;ary, that, lo&s;ing his popula|rity as a preacher, he &s;eems to have been overwhelmed with public contempt.</P>
<P>There is a circum&s;tance hitherto unnoticed in this con|trover&s;y, that may be con&s;idered as a proof of Milton's in|dependent and inflexible &s;pirit. More having heard acci|dentally, from an acquaintance of the Engli&s;h author, that he was preparing to expo&s;e him as the editor of the &s;curri|lous work he had publi&s;hed, contrived to make great intere&s;t in England, fir&s;t, to prevent the appearance, and again, to &s;often the per&s;onal &s;everity of Milton's Second Defence. The Dutch amba&s;&s;ador endeavoured to prevail on Cromwell to &s;uppre&s;s the work. When he found that this was im|po&s;&s;ible, he conveyed to Milton the letters of More, con|taining a prote&s;tation that he was not the author of the in|vective, which had given &s;o much offence; the amba&s;&s;ador at the &s;ame time made it his particular reque&s;t to Milton, that, in an&s;wering the book, as far as it related to the Eng|li&s;h government, he would ab&s;tain from all ho&s;tility again&s;t More.&mdash;Milton replied, <Q>that no unbecoming words &s;hould proceed from his pen;</Q> but his principles would not allow him to &s;pare, at any private interce&s;&s;ion, a public ene|my of his country.

<P>I will &s;tate the charge in the words of his mo&s;t bitter accu&s;er, and without abridgment, that it may appear in its full force:</P>
<Q>Cromwell (&s;ays John&s;on) had now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the par|liament, by the authority of which he had de&s;troyed mo|narchy, and commenced monarch him&s;elf under the title of protector, but with kingly, and more than kingly, power.&mdash;That his authority was lawful never was pre|tended; he him&s;elf founded his right only in nece&s;&s;ity: but Milton, having now ta&s;ted the honey of public em|ployment, would not return to hunger and philo&s;ophy, but, continuing to exerci&s;e his office under a manife&s;t u&s;urpation, betrayed to his power that liberty which he had defended. Nothing can be more ju&s;t than that rebellion &s;hould end in &s;lavery; that he who had ju&s;tified the murder of the king for &s;ome acts, which to him &s;eemed unlawful, &s;hould now &s;ell his &s;ervices and his flatteries to a tyrant, of whom it was evident that he could do nothing lawful.</Q>
<P>Let us ob&s;erve, for the honour of Milton, that the para|graph, in which he is arraigned with &s;o much rancour, con|tains a political dogma, that, if it were really true, might bla&s;t the glory of all the illu&s;trious characters who are parti|cularly endeared to every Engli&s;h heart. If nothing can be
<PB N="127" REF="148">
more ju&s;t than that rebellion &s;hould end in &s;lavery, why do we revere tho&s;e ance&s;tors, who contended again&s;t kings? why do we not re&s;ign the privileges that we owe to their repeated rebellion? but the dogma is utterly unworthy of an Engli&s;h morali&s;t; for a&s;&s;uredly we have the &s;anction of truth, rea&s;on, and experience, in &s;aying, that rebellion is morally criminal or meritorious, according to the pro|vocation by which it is excited, and the end it pur|&s;ues. This doctrine was &s;upported even by a &s;ervant of the imperious Elizabeth. "Sir Thomas Smith" (&s;ays Milton in his Tenure of Kings and Magi&s;trates) <Q>a prote&s;tant and a &s;tate&s;man, in his Commonwealth of England, putting the que&s;tion, whether it be lawful to ri&s;e again&s;t a tyrant, an&s;wers, that the vulgar judge of it according to the event, and the learned according to the purpo&s;e of them that do it.</Q> Dr. John&s;on, though one of <HI>the learned,</HI> here &s;hews not that candour which the liberal &s;tate&s;man had de&s;cribed as the characteri&s;tic of <HI>their</HI> judgment. The biographer, uttering him&s;elf political tenets of the mo&s;t &s;ervile complexion, accu&s;es Milton of &s;ervility; and, in his mode of u&s;ing the words honey and hunger, falls into a petulant meanne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, that too clearly di&s;covers how cordially he dete&s;ted him. But perhaps this dete&s;tation was the mere effect of political prejudice, the common but unchri&s;tian abhorrence that a vehement royali&s;t thinks it virtue to harbour and to mani|fe&s;t again&s;t a republican. We might indeed ea&s;ily believe that John&s;on's rancour again&s;t Milton was merely political, had he not appeared as the biographer of another illu&s;trious republican; but when we find him repre&s;enting as honour|able

in Blake the very principles and conduct which he en|deavours to make infamous and contemptible in Milton, can we fail to ob&s;erve, that he renders not the &s;ame ju&s;tice to the heart of the great republican author which he had nobly rendered to the gallant admiral of the republic. To Blake he generou&s;ly a&s;&s;igns the prai&s;e of intrepidity, hone&s;ty, contempt of wealth, and love of his country. A&s;&s;uredly the&s;e virtues were as eminent in Milton&mdash;and however dif|ferent their lines in life may appear, the celebrated &s;peech of Blake to his &s;eamen, "It is our bu&s;ine&s;s to hinder foreigners from fooling us," by which he ju&s;tified his continuance in his po&s;t under Cromwell, is &s;ingularly appli|cable to Milton, who, as a &s;ervant engaged by the &s;tate to conduct in Latin its foreign corre&s;pondence, might think him&s;elf as &s;trongly bound in duty and honour as the ju&s;tly applauded admiral, <Q>to hinder his country from being fooled by foreigners.</Q> "But Milton," &s;ays his uncandid biographer, <Q>continuing to exerci&s;e his office under a mani|fe&s;t u&s;urpation, betrayed to his power that liberty which he had defended.</Q> Was the u&s;urpation more manife&s;t to Milton than to Blake?

<P>That the Latin &s;ecretary of the nation de&s;erved not this bitterne&s;s of cen&s;ure for remaining in his office may be thought &s;ufficiently proved by the example of Blake.&mdash;If his conduct in this article required farther ju&s;tification, we might recollect with the candid bi&s;hop Newton, that the blamele&s;s Sir Matthew Hale, the favourite model of inte|grity, exerci&s;ed under Cromwell the higher office of a judge; but the heavie&s;t charge again&s;t Milton is yet un|an&s;wered, the charge of lavi&s;hing the mo&s;t &s;ervile adulation on the u&s;urper.</P>
<P>In replying to this mo&s;t plau&s;ible accu&s;ation, let me be indulged in a few remarks, that may vindicate the credit not only of a &s;ingle poet but of all Parna&s;&s;us. The poe|tical fraternity have been often accu&s;ed of being ever ready to flatter; but the general charge is in &s;ome mea&s;ure incon|&s;i&s;tent with a knowledge of human nature. As poets, gene|rally &s;peaking, have more &s;en&s;ibility and le&s;s prudence than other men, we &s;hould naturally expect to find them rather di&s;tingui&s;hed by abundance than by a want of &s;incerity; when they are candidly judged, they will generally be found &s;o; a poet indeed is as apt to applaud a hero as a lover is to prai&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s, and both, according to the forcible and true expre&s;&s;ion of Shake&s;pear,

Their de&s;criptions are more faithful to the acutene&s;s of their own feelings than to the real qualities of the objects de|&s;cribed. Paradoxical as it may &s;ound, they are often defi|cient in truth, in proportion to the exce&s;s of their &s;incerity; the charm or the merit they celebrate is partly the phan|tom of their own fancy; but they believe it real, while they prai&s;e it as a reality; and as long as their belief is &s;incere, it is unju&s;t to accu&s;e them of adulation. Milton him&s;elf gives us an excellent touch&s;tone for the trial of prai&s;e in the following pa&s;&s;age of his Areopagitica; <Q>there are three principal things, without which all prai&s;ing is but court|&s;hip and flattery; fir&s;t, when that only is prai&s;ed, which is &s;olidly worth prai&s;e; next, when greate&s;t likelihoods are brought that &s;uch things are truly and really in tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom they are a&s;cribed; the other, when he who prai&s;es, by &s;hewing that &s;uch his actual per&s;ua&s;ion is of whom he writes, can demon&s;trate that he flatters not.</Q> If we try Milton by this his own equitable law, we mu&s;t ho|nourably acquit him of the illiberal charge that might al|mo&s;t be thought &s;ufficiently refuted by its apparent incon|&s;i&s;tency with his elevated &s;pirit.</P>

<P>That &s;ublime religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, which was the predo|minant characteri&s;tic of the poet, expo&s;ed him particularly to be duped by the prime artifice of the political impo&s;tor, who was indeed &s;o con&s;ummate in the art of deception, that he occa&s;ionally deceived the prudent unheated Ludlow and the penetrating inflexible Brad&s;haw; nay, who carried his habitual deception to &s;uch a length, that he is &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome acute judges of human nature, to have been ultimately the dupe of his own hypocritical fervour, and to have thought him&s;elf, what he induced many to think him, the &s;elected &s;ervant of God, expre&s;sly cho&s;en to accompli&s;h won|ders, not only for the good of his nation, but for the true intere&s;t of Chri&s;tendom.</P>

The ad|monition
<PB N="136" REF="157">
to the people, with which Milton concludes his &s;econd defence, is by no means inferior in dignity and &s;pirit to the advice he be&s;towed on the protector. The great mi&s;fortune of the monitor was, that the two parties, to whom he addre&s;&s;ed his eloquent and patriotic exhortation, were neither of them &s;o worthy of his coun&s;el as he wi&s;hed them to be, and endeavoured to make them. For Crom|well, as his &s;ub&s;equent conduct &s;ufficiently proved, was a political impo&s;tor with an arbitrary &s;oul; and as to the people, they were alternately the di&s;honoured in&s;truments and victims of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and fanatici&s;m. The protector, his adherents, and his enemies, to &s;peak of them in general, were as little able to reach the di&s;intere&s;ted purity of Mil|ton's principles, as they were to attain, and even to e&s;timate, the &s;ublimity of his poetical genius. But Milton, who pa&s;|&s;ionately loved his country, though he &s;aw and lamented the various corruptions of his contemporaries, &s;till conti|nued to hope, with the native ardour of a &s;anguine &s;pirit, that the ma&s;s of the Engli&s;h people would be enlightened and improved. His real &s;entiments of Cromwell, I am per&s;uaded, were the&s;e: he long regarded him as a per&s;on not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wonderful influence and ability, but di&s;po&s;ed to attempt, and likely to accompli&s;h, the pure&s;t and noble&s;t purpo&s;es of policy and religion; yet often thwarted and embarra&s;&s;ed in his be&s;t de&s;igns, not only by the power and machinations of the enemies with whom he had to contend, but by the want of faith, morality, and &s;en&s;e in the motley multitude, whom he endeavoured to guide and govern. As religious enthu&s;ia&s;m was the predo|minant
<PB N="137" REF="158">
characteri&s;tic of Milton, it is mo&s;t probable that his fervid imagination beheld in Cromwell a per&s;on de&s;tined by heaven to reduce, if not to annihilate, what he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t enormous grievance of earth, the prevalence of popery and &s;uper&s;tition. The &s;everal humane and &s;pirited letters which he wrote, in the name of Cromwell, to redre&s;s the injuries of the per&s;ecuted prote&s;tants, who &s;uffered in Piedmont, were highly calculated to promote, in equal de|grees, his zeal for the purity of religion, and his attach|ment to the protector.</P>
<P>Yet great as the powers of Cromwell were to dazzle and delude, and willing as the liberal mind of Milton was to give credit to others for that pure public &s;pirit, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, there is great rea&s;on to apprehend, that his veneration and e&s;teem for the protector were entirely de&s;troyed by the treacherous de&s;poti&s;m of his latter days. But however his opinion of Oliver might change, he was far from betraying liberty, according to John&s;on's ungene|rous accu&s;ation, by continuing to exerci&s;e his office; on the contrary, it ought to be e&s;teemed a proof of his fidelity to freedom, that he conde&s;cended to remain in an office, which he had received from no individual, and in which he ju&s;tly con&s;idered him&s;elf as a &s;ervant of the &s;tate. From one of his familiar letters, written in the year preceding the death of Cromwell, it is evident that he had no &s;ecret intimacy or influence with the protector; and that, in&s;tead of engaging in ambitious machinations, he confined him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible to the privacy of dome&s;tic life. Finally, on a full and fair review of all the intercour&s;e between Milton and
<PB N="138" REF="159">
Cromwell, there is not the &s;malle&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect, that Milton ever &s;poke or acted as a &s;ycophant or a &s;lave; he be&s;towed, indeed, the mo&s;t liberal eulogy, both in pro&s;e and rhyme, upon the protector; but at a period when it was the general opinion, that the utmo&s;t efforts of panegyric could hardly equal the magnitude and the variety of the &s;ervices rendered to his country by the acknowledged hero and the fancied patriot; at a period when the eulogi&s;t, who under|&s;tood the frailty of human nature, and fore&s;aw the tempta|tions of recent power, might hope that prai&s;e &s;o magnifi|cent, united to the noble&s;t advice, would prove to the ar|dent &s;pirit of the protector the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t the delirium of tyranny. The&s;e generous hopes were di&s;ap|pointed; the de&s;potic proceedings of Cromwell convinced his independent monitor, that he de&s;erved not the continued applau&s;e of a free &s;pirit; and though the atchievements of the protector were &s;o fa&s;cinating, that poetical panegyrics encircled even his grave, yet Milton prai&s;ed him no more, but after his decea&s;e fondly hailed the revival of parlia|mentary independence, as a new dawning of God's provi|dence on the nation. In contemplating the&s;e two extraor|dinary men together, the real lover of truth and freedom can hardly fail to ob&s;erve the &s;triking contra&s;t of their cha|racters; one was an ab&s;olute model of fal&s;e, and the other of true, grandeur. Mental dignity and public virtue were in Cromwell fictitious and delu&s;ive; in Milton they were genuine and unchangeable; Cromwell &s;hews the formidable wonders that courage and cunning can perform, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fortune; Milton, the wonders, of a &s;uperior
<PB N="139" REF="160">
kind, that integrity and genius can accompli&s;h, in de&s;pight of adver&s;ity and affliction.</P>
<P>An eager &s;olicitude to vindicate a mo&s;t noble mind from a very ba&s;e and injurious imputation has led me to antici|pate &s;ome public events. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the na|tive and incorruptible independence of Milton's mind, let us return to the incidents of his dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>Soon after his removal to his hou&s;e in We&s;tmin&s;ter, his fourth child, Deborah, was born, on the 2d of May, 1652. The mother, according to Philips, died in child-bed. The &s;ituation of Milton at this period was &s;uch as might have depre&s;&s;ed the mind of any ordinary man: at the age of forty-four he was left a widower, with three female orphans, the elde&s;t about &s;ix years old, deformed in her per&s;on, and with an impediment in her &s;peech; his own health was very deli|cate; and with eyes that were rapidly &s;inking into incurable blindne&s;s, he was deeply engaged in a literary conte&s;t of the highe&s;t importance. With what &s;pirit and &s;ucce&s;s he tri|umphed over his political and per&s;onal enemies the reader is already informed. When the&s;e, in 1654, were all &s;ilenced and &s;ubdued by the irre&s;i&s;tible power of his &s;uperior talents and probity, <Q>he had lei&s;ure again (&s;ays his nephew) for his own &s;tudies and private de&s;igns.</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems to have been the habit of Milton to devote as many hours in every day to inten&s;e &s;tudy as the mental fa|culties could bear, and to render &s;uch con&s;tant exertion le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive to the mind, by giving variety to the objects of its application, engaging in different works of magnitude at the &s;ame time, that he might occa&s;ionally relieve and in|&s;pirit
<PB N="140" REF="161">
his thoughts by a tran&s;ition from one &s;pecies of com|po&s;ition to another. If we may rely on the information of Philips, he now began to employ him&s;elf in this manner on three great works; a voluminous Latin Dictionary, a hi&s;tory of England, and an Epic poem; of the two la&s;t I &s;hall &s;peak again, according to the order of their publica|tion. The fir&s;t and lea&s;t important, a work to which blind|ne&s;s was peculiarly unfavourable, was never brought to ma|turity, yet &s;erved to amu&s;e this mo&s;t diligent of authors, by a change of literary occupation, almo&s;t to the clo&s;e of his life. His collection of words amounted to three folios; but the papers, after his decea&s;e, were &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed and defi|cient (to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of his nephew) that the work could not be made fit for the pre&s;s. They proved &s;ervice|able, however, to future compilers, and were u&s;ed by tho&s;e who publi&s;hed the Latin Dictionary at Cambridge, in 1693.</P>
<P>Though he had no eyes to chu&s;e a &s;econd wife, Milton did not long continue a widower. He married Catherine, the daughter of Captain Woodcock, a rigid &s;ectari&s;t, &s;ays Mr. Warton, of Hackney. This lady appears to have been the mo&s;t tender and amiable of the poet's three wives, and &s;he is the only one of the three whom the mu&s;e of Milton has immortalized with an affectionate memorial. Within the year of their marriage &s;he gave birth to a daughter, and very &s;oon followed her infant to the grave. "Her hu&s;band" (&s;ays John&s;on) <Q>has honoured her memory with a poor &s;onnet;</Q> an expre&s;&s;ion of contempt, which only proves that the rough critic was unable to &s;ympathi&s;e with the
<PB N="141" REF="162">
tenderne&s;s that reigns in the pathetic poetry of Milton: in the opening of this &s;onnet;
<Q><L>Methought I &s;aw my late e&s;pou&s;ed &s;aint</L>
<L>Brought to me, like Alce&s;tis, from the grave,</L>

and in the latter part of it,

<L>But O, as to embrace me &s;he inclin'd</L>
<L>I wak'd, &s;he fled, and day brought back my night.</L></Q>
Milton has equalled the mournful graces of Petrarch and of Camoens, who have each of them left a plaintive compo&s;i|tion on a &s;imilar idea. The curious reader, who may wi&s;h to compare the three poets on this occa&s;ion, will find the &s;imilarity I &s;peak of in the 79th &s;onnet of Petrarch, and the 72d of Camoens.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of a wife &s;o beloved, and the &s;evere inthralment of his country under the increa&s;ing de&s;poti&s;m of Cromwell, mu&s;t have wounded very deeply the tender and patriotic feelings of Milton. His variety of affliction from the&s;e &s;ources might probably occa&s;ion his being &s;ilent, as an author, for &s;ome years. In 1655 he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have written a national manife&s;to in Latin, to ju&s;tify the war again&s;t Spain. From that time, when his defence of him|&s;elf
<PB N="142" REF="163">
al&s;o appeared, we know not of his having been engaged in any publication till the year 1659, excepting a political manu&s;cript of Sir Walter Raleigh, called the Cabinet Council, which he printed in 1658, with a brief adverti&s;e|ment. What his &s;entiments were concerning the la&s;t years of Cromwell, and the following di&s;tracted period, we have a &s;triking proof in one of his private letters, written not long after the death of the protector. In reply to his foreign friend Oldenburg (he &s;ays) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab hi&s;toria no&s;trorum motuum con|cinnanda, quod hortari videris, longe ab&s;um; &s;unt enim &s;ilentio digniores quam praeconio: nec nobis qui motuum hi&s;toriam concinnare, &s;ed qui motus ip&s;os componere feliciter po&s;&s;it e&s;t opus; tecum enim ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or ne libertatis ac reli|gionis ho&s;tibus nunc nuper &s;ocietatis, nimis opportuni inter has no&s;tras civiles di&s;cordias vel potius in&s;anias, videamur; verum non illi gravius quam no&s;metip&s;i jamdiu flagitiis no&s;|tris religioni vulnus intulerint.&mdash;Pro&s;e Works, vol. 2. p. 585.</NOTE> "I am very far from preparing a hi&s;tory of our commotions, as you &s;eem to advi&s;e, for they are more worthy of &s;ilence than of panegyric; nor do we want a per&s;on with ability to frame an hi&s;tory of our troubles, but to give tho&s;e troubles a happy termination; for I &s;ympathi&s;e with you in the fear, that the enemies of our liberty and our religion, who are recently combined, may find us too much expo&s;ed to their attack in the&s;e our civil di&s;&s;entions, or rather our fits of frenzy; they cannot, how|ever, wound our religion more than we have done our&s;elves by our own enormities." The intere&s;t of religion appears on every occa&s;ion to have maintained its due a&s;cendency in the mind of Milton, and to have formed, through the whole cour&s;e of his life, the primary object of his pur&s;uit; it led him to publi&s;h, in 1659, two di&s;tinct treati&s;es, the fir&s;t on civil power in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es; the &s;econd,

<P>"Of civil liberty I have written heretofore by the ap|pointment, and not without the approbation, of civil power; of Chri&s;tian liberty I write now, which others long &s;ince having done with all freedom under heathen emperors, I &s;hould do wrong to &s;u&s;pect that I now &s;hall with le&s;s under Chri&s;tian governors, and &s;uch e&s;pecially as profe&s;s openly their defence of Chri&s;tian liberty; although I write this not otherways appointed or induced than by an inward per&s;ua&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian duty, which I may u&s;efully di&s;|charge herein to the common Lord and Ma&s;ter of us all, and the certain hope of his approbation, fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t to be &s;ought." Milton was not a being of that common and reptile cla&s;s, who a&s;&s;ume an affected devotion as the ma&s;k of malignity. In addre&s;&s;ing his &s;econd treati&s;e al&s;o to the Par|liament, he de&s;cribes him&s;elf as a man under the protection of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, who had u&s;ed, during eighteen years, on all occa&s;ions to a&s;&s;ert the ju&s;t rights and freedom both of church and &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="165">Had he been con&s;cious of any ba&s;e &s;ervility to Cromwell, he would certainly have ab&s;tained from this manly a&s;&s;ertion of his own patriotic integrity, which, in that ca&s;e, would have been only ridiculous and contemptible.

<P>Amid&s;t the various political di&s;tractions towards the end of the year 1659, he addre&s;&s;ed a letter to a namele&s;s friend, who had conver&s;ed with him the preceding evening on the dangerous ruptures of the commonwealth. This letter and a brief paper, containing a &s;ketch of a commonwealth, addre&s;&s;ed to general Monk, were, &s;oon after the author's

death communicated by his nephew to Toland, who im|parted them to the public.</P>
<P>Milton gave yet another proof of his unwearied attention to public affairs, by publi&s;hing brief notes on a &s;ermon preached by Dr. Griffith, at Mercer's Chapel, March 25th, 1660, <Q>wherein (&s;ays the annotator) many notorious wre&s;tings of &s;cripture, and other fal&s;ities, are ob&s;erved.</Q></P>
<P>When the repeated prote&s;tations of Monk to &s;upport the republic had ended in his introduction of the king, the anxious friends of Milton, who thought the literary cham|pion of the parliament might be expo&s;ed to revenge from the triumphant royali&s;ts, hurried him into concealment. The &s;olicitude of tho&s;e who watched over his &s;afety was &s;o great, that, it is &s;aid, they deceived his enemies by a report of his death, and effectually prevented a &s;earch for his per&s;on (during the fir&s;t tumultuary and vindictive rage of the royali&s;ts) by a pretended funeral. A few weeks be|fore the re&s;toration (probably in April) he quitted his hou&s;e in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and did not appear in public again till after the act of oblivion, which pa&s;&s;ed on the 29th of Augu&s;t. In this important interval &s;ome events occurred, which greatly affected both his &s;ecurity and reputation. The Hou&s;e of Commons, on the 16th of June, manife&s;ted their re&s;entment again&s;t his per&s;on as well as his writ|ings, by ordering the attorney general to commence a pro|&s;ecution again&s;t him, and petitioning the king, that his two books, the Defence of the People, and his An&s;wer to Eikon Ba&s;ilike, might be publicly burnt.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="167">Happily for the honour of England, the per&s;on of the great author was more fortunate than his writings in e&s;caping from the fury of per&s;ecution. Within three days after the burning of his books, he found him&s;elf relieved from the nece&s;&s;ity of concealment, and &s;heltered under the common protection of the law by the general act of indemnity, which had not included his name in the li&s;t of exceptions. It has been thought wonderful by many, that a writer, who&s;e ce|lebrated compo&s;itions had rendered him an object of abhor|rence to the royal party, could elude the activity of their triumphant revenge, and various conjectures have been &s;tarted to account for the &s;afety of Milton, after his enemies had too plainly di&s;covered an inclination to cru&s;h him. One of the&s;e conjectural cau&s;es of his e&s;cape repre&s;ents two con|temporary poets in &s;o amiable a light, that though I am un|able to confirm the anecdote entirely by any new evidence, I &s;hall yet dwell upon it with plea&s;ure. Richard&s;on, who&s;e affectionate veneration for the genius and virtue he cele|brates makes ample amends for all the quaintne&s;s of his &s;tyle, has the following pa&s;&s;age on the &s;ubject in que&s;tion:</P>
<P><Q>Perplexed and inqui&s;itive as I was, I at length found the &s;ecret, which he from whom I had it thought he had communicated to me long ago, and wondered he had not. I will no longer keep you in expectation:&mdash;'twas Sir William Davenant obtained his remi&s;&s;ion, in return for his own life procured by Milton's intere&s;t, when him&s;elf was under condemnation, anno 1650&mdash;a life was owing to Milton (Davenant's) and 'twas paid nobly; Milton's for Davenant's, at Davenant's interce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It
<PB N="147" REF="168">
will now be expected I &s;hould declare what authority I have for this &s;tory;&mdash;my fir&s;t an&s;wer is, Mr. Pope told it me. Whence had he it? From Mr. Betterton&mdash;Sir William was his patron&mdash;Betterton was prentice to a book&s;eller, John Holden, the &s;ame who printed Dave|nant's Gondibert. There Sir William &s;aw him, and, per&s;uading his ma&s;ter to part with him, brought him fir&s;t on the &s;tage. Betterton then may be well allowed to know this tran&s;action from the fountain head.</Q></P>
<P>On this intere&s;ting anecdote John&s;on makes the follow|ing remark: <Q>Here is a reciprocation of genero&s;ity and gratitude &s;o plea&s;ing, that the tale makes its own way to credit, but if help were wanted I know not where to find it; the danger of Davenant is certain from his own relation, but of his e&s;cape there is no account.</Q></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age of the critical biographer affords a &s;ingular proof, that he is &s;ometimes as inaccurate in narration as he is defective in &s;entiment. Impre&s;&s;ed as I am with the cleare&s;t conviction of his repeated endeavours to depreciate the character of Milton, I will not &s;uppo&s;e that John&s;on could de&s;ignedly &s;uppre&s;s an evidence of the poet's genero|&s;ity, which, while he is &s;peaking of it in terms of admira|tion, he &s;till endeavours to render problematical; yet cer|tain it is, that of Milton's protection of Davenant a very obvious evidence exi&s;ts in Antony Wood, who &s;ays, under the article Davenant, <Q>he was carried pri&s;oner to the I&s;le of Wight, anno 1650, and afterwards to the Tower of London, in order to be tried for his life in the High Court of Ju&s;tice, anno 1651; but upon the mediation of John
<PB N="148" REF="169">
Milton and others, e&s;pecially two godly aldermen of York (to whom he had &s;hewn great civility when they had been taken pri&s;oners in the north by &s;ome of the forces under William Marquis of Newca&s;tle) he was &s;aved, and had liberty allowed him as a pri&s;oner at large.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far the plea&s;ing &s;tory is &s;ufficiently proved to the honour of Milton. That Davenant endeavoured to return the favour is highly probable, from the amiable tenderne&s;s and benevolent activity of his character. Perhaps this pro|bability may &s;eem a little &s;trengthened by the following ver&s;es of Davenant, in a poem addre&s;&s;ed to the king on his happy return:
<Q><L>Your clemency has taught us to believe</L>
<L>It wi&s;e as well as virtuous to forgive;</L>
<L>And now the mo&s;t offended &s;hall proceed</L>
<L>In great forgiving, till no laws we need;</L>
<L>For laws &s;low progre&s;&s;es would quickly end</L>
<L>Could we forgive as fa&s;t as men offend.</L></Q></P>
<P>If Davenant was in any degree in&s;trumental to the &s;ecu|rity of Milton, it is probable that he &s;erved him rather from gratitude than affection, as no two writers of the time were more different from each other in their religious and poli|tical opinions. That the poet-laureat of Charles was ut|terly uncon&s;cious of tho&s;e ine&s;timable poetic powers, which the blind &s;ecretary of the republic was providentially re|&s;erved to di&s;play, we may infer from a very remarkable couplet, towards the clo&s;e of a &s;econd poem, addre&s;&s;ed by

It is however very po&s;&s;ible that Davenant might doubly conduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the production of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; fir&s;t, as one of tho&s;e who excited their influence to &s;ecure the author from mole&s;tation; and &s;econdly, as affording by his Gondibert an incentive to the genius of Milton to &s;hew how infinitely he could &s;urpa&s;s a poem which Hobbs (who&s;e opinions he de&s;pi&s;ed) had extravagantly extolled as the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite production of the epic mu&s;e. In Aubrey's manu&s;cript anecdotes of Milton it is &s;aid, that he began his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t about two years before the return of the king, and fini&s;hed it about three years after that event; the account appears the more probable, as the following lines in the commencement of the &s;eventh book pathetically allude to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation:

<P>How peculiarly affecting are the&s;e beautiful ver&s;es, when the hi&s;tory of the poet &s;ugge&s;ts that he probably wrote them while he was concealed in an ob&s;cure corner of the city, that re&s;ounded with the triumphant roar of his in|toxicated enemies, among whom drunkenne&s;s aro&s;e to &s;uch extravagance, that even the fe&s;tive royali&s;ts found it nece&s;|&s;ary to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, which forbade the drinking of healths. How poignant at this time mu&s;t have been the per&s;onal and patriotic feelings of Milton, who had pa&s;&s;ed his life in animating him&s;elf and his country to habits of temperance, truth, and public virtue, yet had the mortifi|cation or finding that country, &s;o dear to him, now doubly di&s;graced; fir&s;t, by the hypocri&s;y and treacherous ambition of republicans, to who&s;e pretended virtues he had given too ea&s;y credit; and now, by the mean licentious &s;ervility of roy|ali&s;ts, who&s;e more open though not more dangerous vices his upright and high-toned &s;pirit had ever held in abhor|rence.

to the power of the king at the critical period of his re|ception. The neglect of this mea&s;ure contributed not a little to &s;ub&s;equent evils, and the reign of Charles the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cond was in truth deformed with all the public mi&s;ery and di&s;grace which Milton had predicted, when he argued on the idea of his re-admi&s;&s;ion. For his own per&s;on, the lite|rary champion of the people had no le&s;s to dread from the barbarity of public vengeance, or from the private dagger of &s;ome overheated royali&s;t, who, like the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of Dori&s;|laus in Holland, and of A&s;cham in Spain, might think it meritorious to &s;eize any opportunity of de&s;troying a &s;ervant of the Engli&s;h republic.

<P>But John&s;on proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>of evil tongues for Mil|ton to complain required impudence at lea&s;t equal to his other powers; Milton, who&s;e warme&s;t advocates mu&s;t allow, that he never &s;pared any a&s;perity of reproach or brutality of in&s;olence.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are, perhaps, the mo&s;t bitter words that were ever applied by an author, illu&s;trious him&s;elf for great talents, and &s;till more for chri&s;tian virtue, to a character pre-emi|nent in genius and in piety. By &s;hewing to what a mar|vellous degree a very cultivated and devout mind may be exa&s;perated by party rage, may they &s;erve to caution every fervid &s;pirit again&s;t that outrageous animo&s;ity, which a difference of &s;entiment in politics and religion is &s;o apt to produce. It would &s;eem almo&s;t an affront to the memory of Milton to vindicate him elaborately from a charge, who&s;e very words exhibit &s;o palpable a violation of decency and truth.</P>
<P>His colde&s;t advocates, in&s;tead of allowing that he never &s;pared any brutality of in&s;olence, may rather contend, that his native tenderne&s;s of heart, and very graceful education, rendered it hardly po&s;&s;ible for him at any time to be in&s;o|lent and brutal. It would have been wonderful indeed, had he not written with &s;ome degree of a&s;perity, when his antagoni&s;t Salma&s;ius a&s;&s;erted, that he ought to &s;uffer an ignominious and excruciating death. Again&s;t the unfortu|nate (but not innocent) Charles the Fir&s;t, he expre&s;&s;ly de|clares,
<PB N="153" REF="174">
that he publi&s;hed nothing till after his decea&s;e; and that he meant not, as he &s;ays in one of his Latin works, to in&s;ult the Manes of the king, is indeed evident to an un|prejudiced reader, from the following very beautiful and pathetic &s;entence, with which he begins his an&s;wer to the Eikon Ba&s;ilike:</P>
<P>"To de&s;cant on the misfortunes of a per&s;on fallen from &s;o high a dignity, who hath al&s;o paid his final debt, both to nature and his faults, is neither of it&s;elf a thing commend|able, nor the intention of this di&s;cour&s;e." Tho&s;e who fairly con&s;ider the exa&s;perated &s;tate of the contending par|ties, when Milton wrote, and compare his political compo|&s;itions with the &s;avage ribaldry of his opponents, however mi&s;taken they may think him in his ideas of government, will yet find more rea&s;on to admire his temper than to con|demn his a&s;perity.</P>

If the fa&s;cinating powers of his &s;acred poem, and the lu&s;tre

of his integrity, have failed to &s;often the virulence of an aged morali&s;t again&s;t him in our days, what mu&s;t he not have had to apprehend from the raging pa&s;&s;ions of his own time, when his poetical genius had not appeared in its meridian &s;plendor, and when mo&s;t of his writings were con&s;idered as recent crimes again&s;t tho&s;e, who were entering on their ca|reer of triumph and revenge? John&s;on, indeed, a&s;&s;erts in his barbarous cen&s;ure of Milton's exqui&s;ite picture of his own &s;ituation, that the poet, in &s;peaking of his danger, was ungrateful and unju&s;t; that the charge it&s;elf &s;eems to be fal&s;e, for it would be hard to recollect any reproach ca&s;t upon him, either &s;erious or ludicrous, through the whole re|maining part of his life; yet Lauder, once the a&s;&s;ociate of John&s;on in writing again&s;t Milton, expre&s;sly affirms, that it was warmly debated for three days, whether he &s;hould &s;uffer death with the regicides or not, as many contended that his guilt was &s;uperior to theirs. Lauder, indeed, mentions no authority for his a&s;&s;ertion; and the word of a man &s;o &s;u|premely infamous would de&s;erve no notice, were not the circum&s;tance rendered probable by the rancour and atrocity of party &s;pirit. To what dete&s;table exce&s;&s;es this &s;pirit could proceed we have not only an example in Lauder him&s;elf (of who&s;e malignity to the poet I &s;hall have &s;ub&s;equent occa&s;ion to &s;peak) but in that collection of virulent invec|tives again&s;t Milton, compo&s;ed chiefly by his contempora|ries, which Lauder added as an appendix to his own mo&s;t malignant pamphlet.

L'E&s;trange; and if a pen employed &s;o &s;avagely again&s;t Milton could obtain public encouragement and applau&s;e, he might &s;urely, without affectation or timidity, think him|&s;elf expo&s;ed to the dagger of &s;ome equally ho&s;tile and more &s;anguinary royali&s;t. L'E&s;trange, for &s;uch &s;ufferings in the cau&s;e of royalty as really entitled him to reward, obtained, not long after the re&s;toration, the revived but uncon&s;titu|tional office of licen&s;er to the pre&s;s. It was happy for li|terature that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that oppre&s;&s;ive juri&s;diction when the author of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t was obliged to &s;olicit an imprimatur, &s;ince the exce&s;s of his malevolence to Milton might have then exerted it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to entitle both the office and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the execration of the world. The licen&s;er of that period, Thomas Tomkyns, chaplain to archbi&s;hop Sheldon, though hardly &s;o full of rancour as L'E&s;trange (if L'E&s;trange was the real author of the ribaldry a&s;cribed to him) was ab&s;urd or malignant enough to ob&s;truct, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the publication of Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t.

<P><PB N="156" REF="177">By what means the poet was happily enabled to triumph over the malevolence of an enemy in office we are not in|formed by the author, who has recorded this very intere&s;ting anecdote; but from the peril to which his immortal work was expo&s;ed, and which the mention of a licen&s;er to the pre&s;s has led me to anticipate, let us return to his per&s;onal danger: the extent of this danger, and the particulars of his e&s;cape, have never been completely di&s;covered. The account that his nephew gives of him at this momentous period is chiefly contained in the following &s;entence:</P>
<P>"It was a friend's hou&s;e in Bartholomew Clo&s;e where he lived till the act of oblivion came forth, which, it plea&s;ed God, proved as favourable to him as could be hoped or ex|pected, through the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome that &s;tood his friends both in council and parliament; particularly in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Andrew Marvel, a member for Hull, acted vigorou&s;ly in his behalf, and made a con&s;iderable party for him."</P>
<P>Marvel, like the &s;uperior author whom he &s;o nobly pro|tected, was him&s;elf a poet and a patriot. He had been a&s;&s;o|ciated with Milton in the office of Latin &s;ecretary in 1657, and cultivated his friend&s;hip by a tender and re&s;pectful at|tachment. As he probably owed to that friend&s;hip the im|provement of his own talents and virtues, it is highly plea&s;ing to find, that he exerted them on different occa&s;ions in e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ecurity, and in celebrating the genius of his incomparable friend. His efforts of regard on the pre&s;ent emergency are liberally de&s;cribed in the preceding expre&s;&s;ion of Philips; and his friendly ver&s;es on the publi|cation
<PB N="157" REF="178">
of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t de&s;erve no common applau&s;e; for the records of literature hardly exhibit a more ju&s;t, a more &s;pirited, or a more generous compliment paid by one poet to another.</P>
<P>But the friend&s;hip of Marvel, vigilant, active, and bene|ficial as it was, could not &s;ecure Milton from being &s;eized and hurried into confinement. It appears from the minutes of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that he was pri&s;oner to their &s;erjeant on the 15th of December. The particulars of his impri&s;onment are involved in darkne&s;s; but Dr. Birch (who&s;e copious life of Milton is equally full of intelligence and candour) conjectures, with great probability, that on his appearing in public after the act of indemnity, and ad|journment of Parliament, on the 13th of September, he was &s;eized in con&s;equence of the order formerly given by the Commons for his pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The exact time of his continuing in cu&s;tody no re&s;earches have a&s;certained. The records of Parliament only prove, that on the 15th of December the Hou&s;e ordered his re|lea&s;e; but the &s;ame upright and undaunted &s;pirit, which had made Milton in his younger days a re&s;olute oppo&s;er of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;till continued a characteri&s;tic of his declining life, and now induced him, di&s;advanta|geou&s;ly &s;ituated as he was for &s;uch a conte&s;t, to re&s;i&s;t the rapacity of the parliamentary officer, who endeavoured to extort from him an exorbitant &s;ee on his di&s;charge. He remon&s;trated to the hou&s;e on the iniquity of their &s;ervant; and as the affair was referred to the committee of privileges,
<PB N="158" REF="179">
he probably obtained the redre&s;s that he had the courage to demand.</P>
<P>In this fortunate e&s;cape from the gra&s;p of triumphant and vindictive power, Milton may be con&s;idered as terminating his political life: commencing from his return to the con|tinent, it had extended to a period of twenty years; in three of the&s;e he had been afflicted with partial but in|crea&s;ing blindne&s;s, and in &s;ix he had been utterly blind. His exertions in this period of his life had expo&s;ed him to infinite obloquy, but his generous and enlightened country, whatever may be the &s;tate of her political opinions, will remember, with becoming equity and pride, that the &s;ub|lime&s;t of her poets, though deceived as he certainly was by extraordinary pretenders to public virtue, and &s;ubject to great illu&s;ion in his ideas of government, is entitled to the fir&s;t of encomiums, the prai&s;e of being truly an hone&s;t man: &s;ince it was a&s;&s;uredly his con&s;tant aim to be the &s;teady di&s;intere&s;ted adherent and encomia&s;t of truth and ju&s;tice; hence we find him continually di&s;playing tho&s;e internal ble&s;&s;ings, which have been happily called, "the clear wit|ne&s;&s;es of a benign nature," an innocent con&s;cience, and a &s;atisfied under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Such is the imperfection of human exi&s;tence, that mi&s;|taken notions and principles are perfectly compatible with elevation, integrity, and &s;atisfaction of mind. The writer mu&s;t be a &s;lave of prejudice, or a &s;ycophant to power, who would repre&s;ent Milton as deficient in any of the&s;e noble endowments.

<P>On regaining his liberty, he took a hou&s;e in Holborn, near Red Lion Fields, but &s;oon removed to Jewin-&s;treet, and there married, in his 54th year, his third wife, Eliza|beth Min&s;hall, the daughter of a gentleman in Che&s;hire. As the misfortune of blindne&s;s &s;eems particularly to require a female companion, and yet almo&s;t precludes the unhappy &s;ufferer from &s;electing &s;uch as might &s;uit him, Milton is &s;aid to have formed this attachment on the recommendation of his friend Dr. Paget, an eminent phy&s;ician of the city, to whom the lady was related. Some biographers have &s;poken har&s;hly of her temper and conduct; but let me ob|&s;erve, in ju&s;tice to her memory, that the manu&s;cript of Aubrey, to whom &s;he was probably known, mentions her as a gentle per&s;on, of a peaceful and agreeable humour.

That &s;he was particularly attentive to her hu&s;band, and treated his infirmities with tenderne&s;s, is candidly remarked by Mr. Warton, in a po&s;thumous note to the te&s;tamentary papers relating to Milton, which his indefatigable re&s;earches at length di&s;covered, and committed to the pre&s;s, a few months before his own various and valuable labours were termi|nated by death. The&s;e very curious and intere&s;ting pa|pers afford information re&s;pecting the latter days of the poet, which his late biographers were &s;o far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, that they could not believe it exi&s;ted. Indeed, Mr. Warton him&s;elf had concluded, that all farther enquiries for the will mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s, as he had failed in a tedious and intricate &s;earch. At la&s;t, however, he was enabled, by the friend&s;hip of Sir William Scott, to re&s;cue from oblivion a curio&s;ity &s;o precious to poetical antiquarians. He found in the prero|gative regi&s;ter the will of Milton, which, though made by his brother Chri&s;topher, a lawyer by profe&s;&s;ion, was &s;et a&s;ide from a deficiency in point of form&mdash;the litigation of this will produced a collection of evidence relating to the te&s;tator, which renders the di&s;covery of tho&s;e long forgotten papers peculiarly intere&s;ting; they &s;hew very forcibly, and in new points of view, his dome&s;tic infelicity, and his amia|able di&s;po&s;ition. The tender and &s;ublime poet, who&s;e &s;en|&s;ibility and &s;ufferings were &s;o great, appears to have been almo&s;t as unfortunate in his daughters as the Lear of Shake|&s;peare. A &s;ervant declares in evidence, that her decea&s;ed ma&s;ter, a little before his la&s;t marriage, had lamented to her the ingratitude and cruelty of his children. He complained,
<PB N="162" REF="183">
that they combined to defraud him in the oeconomy of his hou&s;e, and &s;old &s;everal of his books in the ba&s;e&s;t manner. His feelings on &s;uch an outrage, both as a parent and as a &s;cholar, mu&s;t have been &s;ingularly painful; perhaps they &s;ugge&s;ted to him tho&s;e very pathetic lines, where he &s;eems to paint him&s;elf, in Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes:
<Q><L>I dark in light, expos'd</L>
<L>To daily fraud, contempt, abu&s;e, and wrong,</L>
<L>Within doors or without; &s;till as a fool,</L>
<L>In power of others, never in my own,</L>
<L>Scarce half I &s;eem to live, dead more than half.</L></Q></P>
<P>Unfortunate as he had proved in matrimony, he was pro|bably induced to venture once more into that &s;tate by the bitter want of a dome&s;tic protector again&s;t his inhuman daughters, under which de&s;cription I include only the two elde&s;t; and in palliation even of their conduct, dete&s;table as it appears, we may ob&s;erve, that they are entitled to pity, as having been educated without the ine&s;timable guidance of maternal tenderne&s;s, under a father afflicted with lo&s;s of &s;ight; they were al&s;o young: at the time of Milton's la&s;t marriage his elde&s;t daughter had only reached the age of fifteen, and Deborah, his favourite, was &s;till a child of nine years.</P>
<P>His new connection &s;eems to have afforded him what he particularly &s;ought; that degree of dome&s;tic tranquillity and comfort e&s;&s;ential to his per&s;everance in &s;tudy, which appears to have been, through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune,
<PB N="163" REF="184">
the prime object of his life; and while all his labours were under the direction of religion or of philanthropy, there was nothing too arduous or too humble for his mind. In 1661 he publi&s;hed a little work, entitled, "Accidence commenced Grammar," benevolently calculated for the relief of children, by &s;hortening their very tedious and irk&s;ome progre&s;s in learning the elements of Latin. He publi&s;hed al&s;o, in the &s;ame year, another brief compo&s;ition of Sir Walter Raleigh's, containing (like the former work of that celebrated man, which the &s;ame editor had given to the public) a &s;eries of political maxims; one of the&s;e I am tempted to tran&s;cribe, by a per&s;ua&s;ion that Milton regarded it with peculiar plea&s;ure, from its tendency to ju&s;tify the parliamentary contention with Charles the Fir&s;t. Had the mi&s;guided monarch ob&s;erved the maxim of Raleigh, he would not, like that illu&s;trious victim to the vices of his royal father, have peri&s;hed on the &s;caffold.&mdash;The maxim is the &s;eventeenth of the collection, and gives the follow|ing in&s;truction to a prince for pre&s;erving an hereditary kingdom.</P>
<P>"To be moderate in his taxes and impo&s;itions, and, when need doth require to u&s;e the &s;ubjects pur&s;e, to do it by parliament, and with their con&s;ent, making the cau&s;e apparent to them, and &s;hewing his unwillingne&s;s in charg|ing them. Finally, &s;o to u&s;e it, that it may &s;eem rather an offer from his &s;ubjects, than an exaction by him."</P>
<P>However vehement the enmity of various per&s;ons again&s;t Milton might have been, during the tumult of pa&s;&s;ions on the recent re&s;toration, there is great rea&s;on to believe, that
<PB N="164" REF="185">
his extraordinary abilities and probity &s;o far triumphed over the prejudices again&s;t him, that, with all his republican of|fences upon his head, he might have been admitted to royal favour had he been willing to accept it. Richard&s;on re|lates, on very good authority, that the po&s;t of Latin &s;ecre|tary, in which he had obtained &s;o much credit as a &s;cho|lar, was again offered to him after the Re&s;toration; that he rejected it, and replied to his wife, who advi&s;ed his ac|ceptance of the appointment, "You, as other women, would ride in your coach; for me, my aim is to live and die an hone&s;t man." John&s;on di&s;covers an inclination to di&s;credit this &s;tory, becau&s;e it does honour to Milton, and &s;eemed incon&s;i&s;tent with his own ideas of probability. "He that had &s;hared authority, either with the Parliament or Cromwell," &s;ays John&s;on, "might have forborne to talk very loudly of his hone&s;ty." How mi&s;erably narrow is the prejudice, that cannot allow perfect hone&s;ty to many indivi|duals on both &s;ides in a conte&s;t like that, which divided the nation in the civil wars. Undoubtedly there were men in each party, and men of great mental endowments, who acted, during that calamitous contention, according to the genuine dictates of con&s;cience. Tho&s;e who examine the conduct of Milton with impartiality will be ready to allow, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only one of the mo&s;t cultivated, but one of the mo&s;t upright minds, which the records of human nature have taught us to revere. His retaining his employ|ment under Cromwell has, I tru&s;t, been &s;o far ju&s;tified, that it can no more be repre&s;ented as a blemi&s;h on his integrity. His office, indeed, was of &s;uch a nature, that he might, with|out
<PB N="165" REF="186">
a breach of hone&s;ty, have re&s;umed it under the king; but his return to it, though not ab&s;olutely di&s;honourable, would have ill accorded with that refined purity and eleva|tion of character, which, from his earlie&s;t youth, it was the noble&s;t ambition of Milton to acquire and &s;upport. He would have lo&s;t much of his title to the reverence of man|kind for his magnanimity, had he accepted his former office under Charles the Second, whom he mu&s;t have particularly de&s;pi&s;ed as a profligate and &s;ervile tyrant, as ready to betray the honour of the nation as he was carele&s;s of his own; a per&s;onage whom Milton could never have beheld without hor|ror, on reflecting on his &s;ingular barbarity to his celebrated friend, that eccentric but intere&s;ting character, Sir Henry Vane. The king, &s;o extolled for his mercy, had granted the life of Sir Henry to the joint petition of the Lords and Commons; but, after promi&s;ing to pre&s;erve him, &s;igned a warrant for his execution&mdash;one of the mo&s;t inhuman and dete&s;table acts of duplicity that was ever practi&s;ed again&s;t a &s;ubject by his &s;overeign. It is to the fate of Vane, with others of that party, and to his own per&s;onal &s;ufferings, that the great poet alludes in the following admirable re|flections, a&s;&s;igned to the chorus in his Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes:

<P>Warburton was the fir&s;t, I believe, to remark how exactly the&s;e concluding lines de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of the poet him&s;elf, afflicted by his lo&s;s of property, and "his gout, not cau&s;ed by intemperance." The &s;ame acute but very unequal critic is by no means &s;o happy in his ob&s;erva|tion, that Milton &s;eems to have cho&s;en the &s;ubject of this &s;ublime drama for the &s;ake of the &s;atire on bad wives; it would be hardly le&s;s ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that he cho&s;e the &s;ubject of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t for the &s;ake of de&s;cribing a con|nubial altercation. The nephew of Milton has told us, that he could not a&s;certain the time when this drama was written; but it probably flowed from the heart of the in|dignant

poet &s;oon after his &s;pirit had been wounded by the calamitous de&s;tiny of his friends, to which he alludes with &s;o much energy and pathos. He did not de&s;ign the drama for a theatre, nor has it the kind of action requi&s;ite for theatrical intere&s;t; but in one point of view the Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes is the mo&s;t &s;ingularly affecting compo&s;ition, that was ever produced by &s;en&s;ibility of heart and vigour of ima|gination. To give it this peculiar effect, we mu&s;t remem|ber, that the lot of Milton had a marvellous coincidence with that of his hero, in three remarkable points; fir&s;t (but we &s;hould regard this as the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable article of re&s;emblance) he had been tormented by a beautiful but di&s;|affectionate and di&s;obedient wife; &s;econdly, he had been the great champion of his country, and as &s;uch the idol of public admiration; la&s;tly, he had fallen from that heighth of unrivalled glory, and had experienced the mo&s;t humili|ating rever&s;e of fortune:
<Q>His foes' deri&s;ion, captive, poor, and blind.</Q></P>
<P>In delineating the greater part of Samp&s;on's &s;en&s;ations under calamity, he had only to de&s;cribe his own. No dra|mati&s;t can have ever conformed &s;o literally as Milton to the Horatian precept.
<Q><L>Si vis me flere, dolendum e&s;t</L>
<L>Primum ip&s;i tibi.</L></Q>
And if, in reading the Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes, we ob&s;erve how many pa&s;&s;ages, expre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t energetic &s;en&s;ibility,
<PB N="169" REF="192">
exhibit to our fancy the &s;ufferings and real &s;entiments of the poet, as well as tho&s;e of his hero, we may derive from this extraordinary compo&s;ition a kind of pathetic de|light, that no other drama can afford; we may applaud the felicity of genius, that contrived, in this manner, to relieve a heart overburthened with angui&s;h and indignation, and to pay a half concealed yet hallowed tribute to the memories of dear though di&s;honoured friends, whom the &s;tate of the times allowed not the afflicted poet more openly to deplore.</P>
<P>The concluding ver&s;es of the beautiful chorus (which I have already cited in part) appear to me particularly affect|ing, from the per&s;ua&s;ion that Milton, in compo&s;ing them, addre&s;&s;ed the two la&s;t immediately to Heaven, as a prayer for him&s;elf:
<Q><L>In fine,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t or unju&s;t alike &s;eem mi&s;erable,</L>
<L>For oft alike both come to evil end.</L>
<L>So deal not with this once thy glorious champion,</L>
<L>The image of thy &s;trength, and mighty mini&s;ter.</L>
<L>What do I beg? how ha&s;t thou dealt already?</L>
<L>Behold him in his &s;tate calamitous, and turn</L>
<L>His labours, for thou can'&s;t, to peaceful end.</L></Q></P>
<P>If the conjecture of this application be ju&s;t, we may add, that never was the prevalence of a righteous prayer more happily con&s;picuous; and let me here remark, that how|ever various the opinions of men may be concerning the
<PB N="170" REF="193">
merits or demerits of Milton's political character, the inte|grity of his heart appears to have &s;ecured to him the favour of Providence; &s;ince it plea&s;ed the Giver of all good not only to turn his labours to a peaceful end, but to irradiate his declining life with the mo&s;t abundant portion of tho&s;e pure and &s;ublime mental powers, for which he had con|&s;tantly and fervently prayed, as the choice&s;t bounty of Heaven.</P>
<P>At this period, his kind friend and phy&s;ician, who had proved &s;o &s;erviceable to him in the recommendation of an attentive and affectionate wife, introduced to his notice a young reader of Latin, in that &s;ingular character, Thomas Ellwood, the quaker, who has written a minute hi&s;tory of his own life; a book, which &s;ugge&s;ts the reflection, how &s;trangely a writer may &s;ometimes mi&s;take his way in his endeavours to engage the attention of po&s;terity. Had the hone&s;t quaker bequeathed to the world as circum&s;tantial an account of his great literary friend, as he has done of him&s;elf, his book would certainly have engro&s;&s;ed no com|mon &s;hare of public regard: we are indebted to him, how|ever, for his incidental mention of the great poet; and as there is a plea&s;ing air of &s;implicity and truth in his narrative, I &s;hall gratify the reader by in&s;erting it with very little abridgment:</P>
<P>"JOHN MILTON, a gentleman of great note for learning throughout the learned world, having filled a public &s;tation in former times, lived now a private and retired life in Lon|don; and having wholly lo&s;t his &s;ight, kept always a man
<PB N="171" REF="194">
to read to him, which u&s;ually was the &s;on of &s;ome gentle|man of his acquaintance, whom in kindne&s;s he took to im|prove in his learning.</P>
<P>"By the mediation of my friend, I&s;aac Penington, with Dr. Paget, and of Dr. Paget with John Milton, was I ad|mitted to come to him, not as a &s;ervant to him, which at that time he needed not, nor to be in the hou&s;e with him, but only to have the liberty of coming to his hou&s;e at cer|tain hours, when I would, and to read to him what books he &s;hould appoint me, which was all the favour I de&s;ired."</P>
<P>Ellwood was at this time an ingenuous but undi&s;ciplined young man, about three-and-twenty;&mdash;his father, a ju&s;tice of Oxford&s;hire, had taken him, very un&s;ea&s;onably, from &s;chool, with a view to le&s;&s;en his own expences, and this his younger &s;on, after wa&s;ting &s;ome years at home, attached him|&s;elf, with great fervency, to the &s;ect of quakers. His reli|gious ardour involved him in a long and painful quarrel with his father, and in many &s;ingular adventures&mdash;he united with his pious zeal a lively regard for literature; and being grieved to find that his interrupted education had permitted him to acquire but a &s;lender portion of cla&s;&s;ical learning, he anxiou&s;ly &s;ought the acquaintance of Milton, in the hope of improving it.</P>
<P>"I went, therefore (&s;ays the candid quaker) and took my&s;elf a lodging near to his hou&s;e, which was then in Jewin-&s;treet, as conveniently as I could, and from thence forward went every day in the afternoon, except on the fir&s;t days of the week, and &s;itting by him in his dining-room, read to
<PB N="172" REF="195">
him &s;uch books in the Latin tongue as he plea&s;ed to hear me read.</P>
<P>"At my fir&s;t &s;itting to read to him, ob&s;erving that I u&s;ed the Engli&s;h pronunciation, he told me, if I would have the benefit of the Latin tongue, not only to read and under|&s;tand Latin authors, but to conver&s;e with foreigners, either abroad or at home, I mu&s;t learn the foreign pronunciation; to this I con&s;enting, he in&s;tructed me how to &s;ound the vowels: this change of pronunciation proved a new diffi|culty to me; but,
<Q><L>Labor omnia vincit</L>
<L>Improbus;</L></Q>
And &s;o did I; which made my reading the more accept|able to my ma&s;ter. He, on the other hand, perceiving with what earne&s;t de&s;ire I pur&s;ued learning, gave me not only all the encouragement, but all the help he could; for having a curious ear, he under&s;tood by my tone when I under&s;tood what I read, and when I did not, and accordingly would &s;top me, examine me, and open the mo&s;t difficult pa&s;&s;ages to me."</P>
<P>The clearne&s;s and &s;implicity of Ellwood's narrative brings us, as it were, into the company of Milton, and &s;hews, in a very agreeable point of view, the native courte&s;y and &s;weetne&s;s of a temper, that has been &s;trangely mi&s;repre&s;ented as moro&s;e and au&s;tere.</P>
<P>John&s;on, with his accu&s;tomed a&s;perity to Milton, di&s;co|vers an inclination to cen&s;ure him for his mode of teaching
<PB N="173" REF="196">
Latin to Ellwood; but Milton, who was in&s;tructing an in|digent young man, had probably very friendly rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing him to acquire immediately the foreign pronuncia|tion; and a&s;&s;uredly the patience, good nature, and &s;ucce&s;s, with which he conde&s;cended to teach this &s;ingular attendant, do credit both to the di&s;ciple and the preceptor.</P>
<P>Declining health &s;oon interrupted the &s;tudies of Ellwood, and obliged him to retire to the hou&s;e of a friend and phy|&s;ician in the country. Here, after great &s;uffering from &s;ick|ne&s;s, he revived, and returned again to London.</P>
<P>"I was very kindly received by my Ma&s;ter (continues the intere&s;ting quaker) who had conceived &s;o good an opinion of me, that my conver&s;ation, I found, was acceptable, and he &s;eemed heartily glad of my recovery and return, and into our old method of &s;tudy we fell again, I reading to him, and he explaining to me, as occa&s;ion required."</P>
<P>But learning (as poor Ellwood ob&s;erves) was almo&s;t a forbidden fruit to him. His intercour&s;e with Milton was again interrupted by a &s;econd calamity; a party of &s;oldiers ru&s;hed into a meeting of quakers, that included this unfor|tunate &s;cholar, and he was hurried, with his friends, from pri&s;on to pri&s;on. Though ten-pence was all the money he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, his hone&s;t pride prevented his applying to Milton for relief in this exigence, and he contrived to &s;upport him|&s;elf by his indu&s;try, in confinement, with admirable forti|tude.</P>
<P>Moderate pro&s;perity, however, vi&s;ited at la&s;t this hone&s;t and devout man, affording him an agreeable opportunity
<PB N="174" REF="197">
of being u&s;eful to the great poet, who had deigned to be his preceptor.</P>
<P>An affluent quaker, who re&s;ided at Chalfont, in Bucking|ham&s;hire, &s;ettled Ellwood in his family, to in&s;truct his children, and in 1665, when the pe&s;tilence raged in Lon|don, Milton reque&s;ted his friendly di&s;ciple to find a refuge for him in his neighbourhood.</P>
<P>"I took a pretty box for him," &s;ays this affectionate friend, "in Giles Chalfont, a mile from me, of which I gave him notice, and intended to have waited on him, and &s;een him well &s;ettled in it, but was prevented by impri&s;onment."</P>
<P>This was a &s;econd captivity that the unfortunate young man had to &s;u&s;tain; for in con&s;equence of a recent and mo&s;t iniquitous per&s;ecution of the quakers, he was appre|hended at the funeral of a friend, and confined in the gaol of Ayle&s;bury.</P>
<P>"But being now relea&s;ed," continues Elwood, "I &s;oon made a vi&s;it to him, to welcome him into the country.</P>
<P>After &s;ome common di&s;cour&s;es had pa&s;&s;ed between us, he called for a manu&s;cript of his, which, being brought, he delivered to me, bidding me take it home with me, and read it at my lei&s;ure, and when I had &s;o done, return it to him, with my judgment thereupon.</P>
<P>"When I came home, and &s;et my&s;elf to read it, I found it was that excellent poem, which he entitled Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>"After I had, with the be&s;t attention, read it through, I made him another vi&s;it, and returned him his book, with due acknowledgment of the favour he had done me in communicating it to me. He a&s;ked me how I liked it, and
<PB N="175" REF="198">
what I thought of it? which I mode&s;tly and freely told him; and, after &s;ome farther di&s;cour&s;e about it, I plea&s;antly &s;aid to him, 'Thou ha&s;t &s;aid much here of Paradi&s;e lo&s;t, but what ha&s;t thou to &s;ay of Paradi&s;e found.' He made me no an&s;wer, but &s;at &s;ome time in a mu&s;e, then brake off that di&s;cour&s;e, and fell upon another &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"After the &s;ickne&s;s was over, and the city well clean&s;ed, and become &s;afely habitable again, he returned thither; and when afterwards I went to wait on him there (which I &s;el|dom failed of doing, whenever my occa&s;ions led me to London) he &s;hewed me his &s;econd poem, called Paradi&s;e Regain'd, and in a plea&s;ant tone &s;aid to me, 'This is owing to you, for you put it into my head by the que&s;tion you put to me at Chalfont, which before I had not thought of'."</P>
<P>The per&s;onal regard of this ingenuous quaker for Milton, and his giving birth to a compo&s;ition of &s;uch magnitude and merit as Paradi&s;e Regain'd, entitle him to di&s;tinction in a life of his great poetical friend, and I have therefore rather tran&s;cribed than abridged his relation.

<P>The la&s;t of Milton's familiar letters in Latin relates to this period; it &s;peaks with devotional gratitude of the &s;afe a&s;ylum from the plague, which he had found in the country; it &s;peaks al&s;o with &s;o much feeling of his pa&s;t political adven|tures, and of the pre&s;ent inconvenience which he &s;uffered from the lo&s;s of &s;ight, that I apprehend an entire tran&s;lation of it

<P><PB N="178" REF="201">How intere&s;ting is this complaint, when we recollect that the great writer, reduced to &s;uch irk&s;ome difficulties in regard to his &s;ecretary, was probably engaged at this period in poli&s;hing the &s;ublime&s;t of poems.</P>
<P>From Ellwood's account it appears, that Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t was complete in 1665. Philips and Toland a&s;&s;ert, that it was actually publi&s;hed the following year; but I believe no copy has been found of a date &s;o early. The fir&s;t edition on the li&s;t of the very accurate Mr. Loft was printed by Peter Parker in 1667, and, probably, at the expence of the author, who &s;old the work to Samuel Simmons, by a con|tract dated the 27th of April, in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>The terms of this contract are &s;uch as a lover of genius can hardly hear without a &s;igh of pity and indignation. The author of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t received only an immediate payment of five pounds for a work, which is the very ma&s;ter-piece of &s;ublime and refined imagination; a faculty not only naturally rare, but requiring an extraordinary co|incidence of circum&s;tances to cheri&s;h and &s;trengthen it for the long and regular exerci&s;e e&s;&s;ential to the production of &s;uch a poem. The book&s;eller's agreement, however, enti|tled the author to a conditional payment of fifteen pounds more; five to be paid after the &s;ale of thirteen hundred copies of the fir&s;t edition, and five, in the &s;ame manner, both on a &s;econd and a third. The number of each edition was limited to fifteen hundred copies.</P>
<P>The original &s;ize of the publication was a &s;mall quarto, and the poem was at fir&s;t divided into ten books; but in the &s;econd edition the author very judiciou&s;ly increa&s;ed the
<PB N="179" REF="202">
number to twelve, by introducing a pau&s;e in the long nar|ration of the &s;eventh and of the tenth, &s;o that each of the&s;e books became two.</P>
<P>Simmons was a printer, and his brief adverti&s;ement to the work he had purcha&s;ed is curious enough to merit in|&s;ertion:</P>
<P>"Courteous Reader, there was no argument at fir&s;t in|tended to the book; but for the &s;atisfaction of many that have de&s;ired it, I have procured it, and withal a rea&s;on of that, which &s;tumbled many others, why the poem rhymes not." Here we may plainly &s;ee that the novelty of blank ver&s;e was con&s;idered as an unpalatable innovation. The book, however, advanced &s;o far in its &s;ale, that thirteen hun|dred were di&s;per&s;ed in two years. In April, 1669, the author received his &s;econd payment of five pounds. The &s;econd edition came forth in the year of his death, and the third in four years after that event: his widow, who inherited a right to the copy, &s;old all her claims to Simmons for eight pounds, in December, 1680; &s;o that twenty-eight pounds, paid at different times in the cour&s;e of thirteen years, is the whole pecuniary reward which this great performance pro|duced to the poet and his widow.</P>
<P>But although the emolument, which the author derived from his noble&s;t production, was mo&s;t deplorably inadequate to its merit, he was abundantly gratified with immediate and fervent applau&s;e from &s;everal accompli&s;hed judges of poetical genius. It has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that Para|di&s;e Lo&s;t was neglected to a mortifying degree on its fir&s;t appearance; and that the exalted poet con&s;oled his &s;pirit
<PB N="180" REF="203">
under &s;uch mortification by a magnanimous confidence in the ju&s;tice of future ages, and a &s;anguine anticipation of his poetical immortality. The &s;trength and dignity of his mind would indeed have armed him again&s;t any po&s;&s;ible di&s;|appointment of his literary ambition; but &s;uch was the reception of his work, that he could not be di&s;appointed. John&s;on has vindicated the public on this point with judg|ment and &s;ucce&s;s: <Q>The &s;ale of books (he ob&s;erves) was not in Milton's age what it is in the pre&s;ent; the nation had been &s;atisfied, from 1623 to 1664, that is forty-one years, with only two editions of the works of Shake&s;peare, which probably did not together make one thou&s;and copies. The &s;ale of thirteen hundred copies in two years, in oppo&s;ition to &s;o much recent enmity, and to a &s;tyle of ver&s;ification new to all, and di&s;gu&s;ting to many, was an uncommon example of the prevalence of genius.</Q> The&s;e remarks are perfectly ju&s;t; but when their author proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>the admirers of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t did not dare to publi&s;h their opinion,</Q> he &s;eems to forget the very &s;pirited eulogies that were, during the life of the poet, be&s;towed on that performance. Panegyrick can hardly a&s;&s;ume a bolder tone than in the Engli&s;h and Latin ver&s;es addre&s;&s;ed to Milton by Marvel and Barrow. He received other compliments not inferior to the&s;e. The mu&s;e of Dryden a&s;&s;ured him, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the united excellen|cies of Homer and of Virgil; and, if we may rely on an anecdote related by Richard&s;on, the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t was an|nounced to the world in a very &s;ingular manner, that may
<PB N="181" REF="204">
be thought not ill-&s;uited to the pre-eminence of the work. Sir John Denham, a man di&s;tingui&s;hed as a &s;oldier, a &s;ena|tor, and a poet, came into the Hou&s;e of Commons with a proof-&s;heet of Milton's new compo&s;ition wet from the pre&s;s; and being que&s;tioned concerning the paper in his hand, he &s;aid, it was <Q>part of the noble&s;t poem that ever was written in any language or in any age.</Q> Richard&s;on, who&s;e active and liberal affection for the poet led him to &s;earch with intelligent alacrity and &s;ucce&s;s for every occur|rence that could redound to his honour, has recorded an|other incident, which mu&s;t be particularly intere&s;ting to every lover of literary anecdote, as it di&s;covers how the Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t was fir&s;t introduced to Dryden, and with what fervency of admiration he immediately &s;poke of it. The Earl of Dor&s;et and Fleetwood Shepard, the friend of Prior, &s;ound the poem, according to this &s;tory, at a book&s;eller's in Little Britain, who, lamenting its want of circulation, en|treated the Earl to recommend it; Dor&s;et, after reading it him&s;elf, &s;ent it to Dryden, who &s;aid, in returning the book, "This man cuts us all out, and the ancients too." The&s;e were probably the real &s;entiments of Dryden on his fir&s;t peru&s;al of the poem; but as that unhappy genius was not ble&s;t with the independent magnanimity of Milton, his opi|nions were apt to fluctuate according to his intere&s;t, and we find him occa&s;ionally di&s;po&s;ed to exalt or degrade the tran&s;cendent performance, which he could not but admire. As the &s;ix celebrated ver&s;es, in which he has complimented the Engli&s;h Homer, &s;o much re&s;emble what he &s;aid of him to Lord Dor&s;et, it is probable that tho&s;e ver&s;es were written
<PB N="182" REF="205">
while his mind was glowing with admiration from his fir&s;t &s;urvey of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; and as long as Milton lived, Dryden &s;eems to have paid him the deference &s;o ju&s;tly due to his age, his genius, and his virtue. Aubrey relates, in the manu&s;cript which I have repeatedly cited, that the poet laureat waited on Milton for the purpo&s;e of &s;oliciting his permi&s;&s;ion to put his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t into a drama. "Mr. Milton (&s;ays Aubrey) received him civilly, and told him, he would give him leave to tag his ver&s;es," an expre&s;&s;ion that probably alluded to a couplet of Marvel's, in his poetical eulogy on his friend. The opera which Dryden wrote, in con&s;equence of this permi&s;&s;ion, entitled the State of Inno|cence, was not exhibited in the theatre, and did not appear in print till two years after the death of Milton, who is mentioned in becoming terms of veneration and gratitude in the preface. The drama it&s;elf is a very &s;ingular and &s;triking performance; with all the beauties and all the de|fects of Dryden's animated unequal ver&s;ification, it has pe|culiar claim to the attention of tho&s;e, who may wi&s;h to in|ve&s;tigate the re&s;pective powers of Engli&s;h rhyme and blank ver&s;e, and it may furni&s;h arguments to the partizans of each; for, if in many pa&s;&s;ages the images and harmony of Milton are deplorably injured by the nece&s;&s;ity of rhym|ing, in a few in&s;tances, perhaps, rhyme has imparted even to the ideas of Milton new energy and grace. There are prefixt to this opera &s;ome very animated but injudicious ver&s;es by poor Nat. Lee, who has lavi&s;hed the mo&s;t exagge|rated prai&s;e on his friend Dryden, at the expence of the &s;u|perior poet.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="206">It is highly plea&s;ing to reflect, that Milton, who had &s;o many evils to &s;u&s;tain in the cour&s;e of his chequered life, had yet the high gratification of being a&s;&s;ured, by very competent judges, that he had gloriou&s;ly &s;ucceeded in the prime object of his literary ambition, the great poetical at|chievement, which he projected in youth, and accompli&s;hed in old age. He probably received &s;uch animating a&s;&s;urances from many of his friends, who&s;e applau&s;e, being intended for his private &s;atisfaction, has not de&s;cended to our time; but when we recollect the honours already mentioned, that were paid to the living poet by Denham, Dryden, and Mar|vel, we may re&s;t &s;atisfied in the per&s;ua&s;ion, that he enjoyed a grateful earne&s;t of his future renown, and, according to the petition he addre&s;&s;ed to Urania,
<Q>Fit audience found tho' few.</Q></P>
<P>If the &s;pirit of a departed bard can be gratified by any circum&s;tances of po&s;thumous renown, it might gratify Mil+ton to perceive, that his divine poem was fir&s;t indebted for general celebrity to the admiration of Sommers and of Ad|di&s;on, two of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and mo&s;t amiable of Engli&s;h names. Sommers promoted the fir&s;t ornamented edition of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t in 1688; and Addi&s;on wrote his celebrated papers on Milton in 1712.</P>
<P>But to return to the living author; in the year 1670, the great poet a&s;pired to new di&s;tinction, by appearing in the character of an hi&s;torian.&mdash;He had long meditated a work, which, in his time, was particularly wanted in our
<PB N="184" REF="207">
language, and which the greater cultivation be&s;towed by the pre&s;ent age on this branch of literature has not yet pro|duced in perfection&mdash;an eloquent and impartial hi&s;tory of England. Milton executed only &s;ix books, beginning with the mo&s;t early fabulous period, and clo&s;ing with the Norman conque&s;t. "Why he &s;hould have given the fir&s;t part (&s;ays John&s;on) which he &s;eems not to believe, and which is uni|ver&s;ally rejected, it is difficult to conjecture." Had the cri|tic taken the trouble to peru&s;e a few pages of the work in que&s;tion his difficulty would have vani&s;hed; he would at lea&s;t have found the motive of the author, if he had not e&s;teemed it &s;atisfactory:</P>
<P>"I have determined (&s;ays Milton) in &s;peaking of the ancient and rejected Briti&s;h fables, to be&s;tow the telling over even of the&s;e reputed tales, be it for nothing el&s;e but in favour of our Engli&s;h poets and rhetoricians, who by their art will know how to u&s;e them judiciou&s;ly." This &s;entiment implies a &s;triking fondne&s;s for works of imagina|tion, and a good natured di&s;po&s;ition to promote them.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian di&s;covers higher aims as he advances in his work, and expre&s;&s;es a moral and patriotic de&s;ire to make the le&s;&s;ons &s;ugge&s;ted by the early calamities of this nation a &s;ource of wi&s;dom and virtue to his improving countrymen. The very pa&s;&s;age, which was mo&s;t likely to produce &s;uch an effect, was &s;truck out of the publication by the Gothic hand of the licen&s;er, an incident that &s;eems to give new energy to all the noble arguments, which the injured author had formerly adduced in vindicating the liberty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion contained a very ma&s;terly &s;ketch
<PB N="185" REF="208">
of the long parliament and a&s;&s;embly of divines, contra&s;ting their &s;ituation and their mi&s;conduct, after the death of Charles the Fir&s;t, with tho&s;e of the ancient Britons, when, by the departure of the Roman power, "they were left (according to the expre&s;&s;ion of the hi&s;torian) to the &s;way of their own councils." The author gave a copy of this un|licenced parallel to the celebrated Earl of Angle&s;ey, a man di&s;tingui&s;hed by erudition, with a liberal re&s;pect for genius, and though a mini&s;ter of Charles the Second, a frequent vi&s;iter of Milton. This curious fragment was publi&s;hed in 1681, with a &s;hort preface, declaring, that it originally be|longed to the third book of Milton's Hi&s;tory; and in the edition of his pro&s;e works, in 1738, it was properly replaced. The poet would have &s;ucceeded more eminently as an hi&s;|torian, had his talents been exerci&s;ed on a period more fa|vourable to their exertion. We have rea&s;on to regret his not having executed the latter part of his original intention, in&s;tead of dwelling on the meagre and dark annals of Saxon barbarity. In his early hi&s;tory, however, there are pa&s;&s;ages of great force and beauty; his character of Alfred in parti|cular is worthy that engaging model of an accompli&s;hed monarch, and verifies a &s;entiment, which Milton profe&s;&s;ed, even while he was defending the commonwealth, that al|though a re&s;olute enemy to tyrants, he was a &s;ince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e friend to &s;uch kings as merited the benediction of their people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The attractive merit of Alfred, and the affectionate zeal, with which Milton appears to have delineated his character, form a double motive for in&s;erting it in a note, as a &s;peci|men of the great author's &s;tyle in hi&s;torical compo&s;ition.</P><P>"After which trouble&s;ome time Alfred enjoyning three years of peace, by him &s;pent, as his manner was, not idly or voluptuou&s;ly, but in all virtuous employments both of mind and body, becoming a prince of his renown, ended his days in the year nine hund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, the fifty-fir&s;t of his age, the thirtieth of his reign, and was buried regally at Winche&s;ter: he was born at a place called Wanading, in Berk&s;hire, his mother O&s;burga, the daughter of O&s;lac the king's cup-bearer, a Goth by nation, and of noble de&s;cent. He was of per&s;on comelier than all his brethren, of plea&s;ing tongue, and graceful behaviour, ready wit and memory; yet, through the fondne&s;s of his parents to|wards him, had not been taught to read till the twelfth year of his age; but the great de&s;ire of learning which was in him &s;oon ap|peared, by his conning of Saxon poems day and night, which, with great attention, he heard by others repeated. He was be&s;ides excellent at hunting, and the new art then of hawking, but more exemplary in devotion, having collected into a book certain prayers and p&s;alms, which he carried ever with him in his bo&s;om to u&s;e on all occa&s;ions. He thir&s;ted after all liberal knowledge, and oft complained, that in his youth he had no teachers, in his middle age &s;o little vacancy from wars and the cares of his kingdom; yet lei&s;ure he found &s;ometimes, not only to learn much him&s;elf, but to communicate thereof what he could to his people, by tran&s;lating books out of Latin into Engli&s;h, Oro&s;ius, Boethius, Beda's hi&s;tory, and others; per|mitted none unlearned to bear office, either in court or commonwealth. At twenty years of age, not yet reigning, he took to wi&s;e Eg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;|witha, the daughter of Ethelred, a Mercian earl. The extremities which be&s;el him in the &s;ixth of his reign, Neothan Abbot told him were ju&s;tly come upon him for neglecting, in his younger days, the complaint of &s;uch as, in|jured and oppre&s;&s;ed, repaired to him, as then &s;econd per&s;on in the kingdom, for redre&s;s; which neglect, were it &s;uch indeed, were yet excu&s;able in a youth, through jollity of mind, unwilling perhaps to be detained long with &s;ad and &s;orrowful narrations; but from the time of his undertaking regal charge no man more pa|tient in hearing cau&s;es, more inqui&s;itive in exa|mining, more exact in doing ju&s;tice, and pro|viding good laws, which are yet extant; more &s;evere in puni&s;hing unju&s;t judges or ob&s;tinate offenders, thieves e&s;pecially and robbers, to the terror of whom in cro&s;s-ways were hung upon a high po&s;t certain chains of gold, as it were daring any one to take them thence; &s;o that ju&s;tice &s;eemed in his days not to flouri&s;h only, but to triumph: no man can be more frugal of two precious things in man's life, his time and his revenue; no man wi&s;er in the di&s;po&s;al of both. His time, the day and night, he di&s;tributed by the burning of certain tapers into three equal portions; the one was for devotion, the other for public or private affairs, the third for bodily refre&s;h|ment; how each hour pa&s;t he was put in mind by one who had that office.

<P><PB N="186" REF="209">In 1671, the year after the fir&s;t appearance of his hi&s;tory, he publi&s;hed the Paradi&s;e Regained, and Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="210">Many groundle&s;s remarks have been made on the &s;uppo&s;ed want of judgment in Milton to form a proper e&s;timate of his own compo&s;itions. "His la&s;t poetical offspring (&s;ays John&s;on) was his favourite; he could not, as Ell|wood relates, endure to have Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t preferred to Paradi&s;e Regained." In this brief pa&s;&s;age, there is more than one mi&s;repre&s;entation. It is not Ellwood, but Philips, who &s;peaks of Milton's e&s;teem for his latter poem; and in|&s;tead of &s;aying that the author preferred it to his greater work, he merely intimates, that Milton was offended with the general cen&s;ure, which condemned the Paradi&s;e Re|gained as infinitely inferior to the other. In&s;tead of &s;up|po&s;ing, therefore, that the great poet was under the influ|ence of an ab&s;urd predilection, we have only rea&s;on to con|clude, that he heard with lively &s;corn &s;uch idle wittici&s;m as we find recorded by Toland, "that Milton might be &s;een in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, but not in Paradi&s;e Regained." His own accompli&s;hed mind, in which &s;en&s;ibility and judgment were proportioned to extraordinary imagination, mo&s;t pro|bably

a&s;&s;ured him what is indi&s;putably true, that uncom|mon energy of thought and felicity of compo&s;ition are ap|parent in both performances, however different in de&s;ign, dimen&s;ion, and effect. To cen&s;ure the Paradi&s;e Regained, becau&s;e it does not more re&s;emble the preceding poem, is hardly le&s;s ab&s;urd than it would be to condemn the moon for not being a &s;un, in&s;tead of admiring the two different luminaries, and feeling that both the greater and the le&s;s are vi&s;ibly the work of the &s;ame divine and inimitable power.</P>
<P>John&s;on has very liberally noticed one peculiarity in Milton, and calls it, with a benevolent happine&s;s of expre&s;|&s;ion, <Q>a kind of humble dignity, which did not di&s;dain the meane&s;t &s;ervices to literature. The epic poet, the controverti&s;t, the politician, having already de&s;cended to accommodate children with a book of rudiments, now, in the la&s;t years of his life, compo&s;ed a book of Logic, for the initiation of &s;tudents in philo&s;ophy, and pub|li&s;hed, 1672, Artis Logicae plenior In&s;titutio ad Petri Rami Methodum concinnata, that is, a new &s;cheme of Logic, according to the method of Ramus.</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;o plea&s;ing to find one great author &s;peaking of an|other in terms, which do honour to both, that I tran&s;cribe, with &s;ingular &s;atisfaction, the preceding pa&s;&s;age of the emi|nent biographer, who&s;e frequent and injurious a&s;perity to Milton I have &s;o repeatedly noticed, and mu&s;t continue to notice, with reprehen&s;ion and regret.</P>
<P>In the very moment of delivering the ju&s;t encomium I have commended, the critic di&s;covers an intemperate eager|ne&s;s
<PB N="189" REF="212">
to revile the object of his prai&s;e; for he proceeds to &s;ay of Milton, <Q>I know not whether, even in this book, he did not intend an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t the univer&s;i|ties, for Ramus was one of the fir&s;t oppugners of the old philo&s;ophy, who di&s;turbed with innovations the quiet of the &s;chools.</Q> Is there not a vi&s;ible want of can|dour in &s;hewing &s;o wildly a wi&s;h to impute a very in|offen&s;ive and meritorious work of &s;cience to a malevolent motive?</P>
<P>Ramus was a man, who&s;e writings and memory were ju&s;tly regarded by Milton; for he re&s;embled our great countryman in temperance, in fortitude, in pa&s;&s;ion for &s;tudy, and, above all, in a brave and inflexible oppo&s;ition to ig|norance, tyranny, and &s;uper&s;tition; his life was a conti|nued &s;truggle with the&s;e mercile&s;s enemies, and he peri&s;hed at la&s;t with circum&s;tances of peculiar barbarity, in the atro|cious ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew.</P>
<P>A de&s;ire of rendering ju&s;tice to the talents and virtues of &s;uch a &s;ufferer in the cau&s;e of learning might &s;urely be a&s;|&s;cribed to Milton, as a more probable and becoming mo|tive on this occa&s;ion, than dark intentions of ho&s;tility again&s;t the univer&s;ities. It is but a &s;orry compliment to tho&s;e univer&s;ities to in&s;inuate, that he engaged in warfare again&s;t them, who republi&s;hed a &s;imple and &s;ea&s;onable trea|ti&s;e on the management of human rea&s;on. Milton with great judgment augmented the logic of Ramus, and added to his &s;y&s;tem an abridgment of the Latin life, which Fre|gius had written, of its unfortunate author.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="213">The long literary career of Milton was now drawing to|wards its termination, and it clo&s;ed as it began, with a fervent regard to the intere&s;t of religion.&mdash;Alarmed by that encroachment, which the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition was making under the connivance of Charles the Second, and with the aid of his apo&s;tate brother, Milton publi&s;hed <Q>A treati&s;e of true Religion, Here&s;y, Schi&s;m, Toleration, and the be&s;t Means to prevent the Growth of Popery.</Q> The pa|triotic &s;cope of this work was to unite and con&s;olidate the jarring &s;ects of the prote&s;tants, by per&s;uading them to reci|procal indulgence, and to guard them again&s;t tho&s;e impend|ing dangers from Rome, which, in a &s;hort period, bur&s;t upon this i&s;land, and very happily terminated in our &s;ignal deli|verance from many of tho&s;e religious and political evils, which the &s;pirit of Milton had, through a long life, mo&s;t re&s;olutely and con&s;cientiou&s;ly oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>His treati&s;e again&s;t the growth of popery, which was pub|li&s;hed in 1673, was the la&s;t con&s;iderable performance that he gave to the world; but publication in &s;ome &s;hape &s;eems to have contributed to his amu&s;ement as long as he exi&s;ted. In the &s;ame year he reprinted his &s;maller poems with the Tractate on Education; and in the year following, the la&s;t of his laborious life, he publi&s;hed his Familiar Letters, and a Declaration of the Poles in prai&s;e of their heroic &s;overeign, John Sobie&s;ki, tran&s;lated from the Latin original. A brief hi&s;tory of Mo&s;covia, which he appears to have compiled, in the early parts of his life, from various travellers who had vi&s;ited that country, was publi&s;hed a few years after his death, and two of his compo&s;itions (both perhaps intended for the

pre&s;s) have probably peri&s;hed; the fir&s;t, a Sy&s;tem of Theo|logy in Latin, that &s;eems to have been entru&s;ted to his friend Cyriac Skinner; the &s;econd, an An&s;wer to a &s;cur|rilous libel upon him&s;elf, which his nephew &s;uppo&s;es him to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed from a ju&s;t contempt of his reviler.</P>
<P>Soon after his marriage in 1661, he had removed from Jewin-&s;treet to a hou&s;e in the Artillery-walk, leading to Bunhill-fields, a &s;pot that to his enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers may appear con&s;ecrated by his genius: here he re&s;ided in that period of his days, when he was peculiarly entitled to vene|ration; here he probably fini&s;hed no le&s;s than three of his mo&s;t admirable works; and here, with a di&s;&s;olution to ea&s;y that it was unperceived by the per&s;ons in his chamber, he clo&s;ed a life, clouded indeed by uncommon and various calamities, yet ennobled by the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of &s;uch rare endowments as render his name, perhaps, the very fir&s;t in that radiant and comprehen&s;ive li&s;t, of which England, the mo&s;t fertile of countries in the produce of mental power, has rea&s;on to be proud.</P>
<P>For &s;ome years he had &s;uffered much from the gout, and in July, 1674, he found his con&s;titution &s;o broken by that di&s;temper, that he was willing to prepare for his departure from the world. With this view he informed his brother Chri&s;topher, who was then a bencher in the Inner Temple, of the di&s;po&s;ition he wi&s;hed to make of his property. "Bro|ther (&s;aid the invalid) the portion due to me from Mr. Powell, my fir&s;t wi&s;e's father, I leave to the unkind chil|dren I had by her; but I have received no part of it; and my will and meaning is, they &s;hall have no other benefit of my
<PB N="192" REF="215">
e&s;tate than the &s;aid portion, and what I have be&s;ides done for them, they having been very undutiful to me; and all the re&s;idue of my e&s;tate I leave to the di&s;po&s;al of Elizabeth, my loving wife." Such is the brief te&s;tament, which Mil|ton dictated to his brother, about the 20th of July, but which Chri&s;topher does not appear to have committed to paper till a few days after the decea&s;e of the te&s;tator, who expired on Sunday night, the 15th of November, 1674. "All his learned and great friends in London, (&s;ays To|land) not without a friendly concour&s;e of the vulgar, accom|panied his body to the church of St. Giles, near Cripple|gate, where he lies buried in the chancel." This bio|grapher, who, though he had the misfortune to think very differently from Milton on the great article of religion, yet never fails to &s;peak of him with affectionate re&s;pect, in|dulged a plea&s;ing expectation, when he wrote his life in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, that national munificence would &s;peedily rai&s;e a monument worthy of the poet, to protect and to honour his remains. To the di&s;credit of our coun|try &s;he has failed to pay this decent tribute to the memory of a man, from who&s;e genius &s;he has derived &s;o much glory; but an individual, Mr. Ben&s;on, in the year 1737, placed a bu&s;t of the great author in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; an act of liberality that does him credit, though John&s;on and Pope have both &s;atyrized the monumental in&s;cription with a de|gree of cynical a&s;perity: &s;uch a&s;perity appears un&s;ea&s;onable, becau&s;e all the o&s;tentation, &s;o &s;everely cen&s;ured in Mr. Ben|&s;on, amounts merely to his having &s;aid, in the plaine&s;t manner, that he rai&s;ed the monument; and to his having
<PB N="193" REF="216">
added to his own name a common enumeration of the offices he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; a circum&s;tance in which candour might have di&s;covered rather more mode&s;ty than pride.&mdash;Affluence ap|pears particularly amiable when paying a voluntary tribute to neglected genius, even in the grave; nor is Ben&s;on the only individual of ample fortune, who has endeared him&s;elf to the lovers of literature by generous endeavours to promote the celebrity of Milton. Affectionate admirers of the poet will honour the memory of the late Mr. Hollis, in recollect|ing that he devoted much time and money to a &s;imilar pur|&s;uit; and they will regret that he was unable to di&s;cover the Italian ver&s;es, and the marble bu&s;t, which he diligently &s;ought for in Italy, on a &s;ugge&s;tion that &s;uch memorials of our poetic traveller had been carefully pre&s;erved in that country. But from this brief digre&s;&s;ion on the recent ad|mirers of Milton, let us return to his family at the time of his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>His will was conte&s;ted by the daughters, who&s;e undutiful conduct it condemned: being deficient in form, it was &s;et a&s;ide, and letters of admini&s;tration were granted to the widow, who is &s;aid to have allotted an hundred pounds to each daughter, a &s;um which, being probably too little in their opinion, and too much in her's, would naturally pro|duce reciprocal animo&s;ity and cen&s;ure between the contend|ing parties.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that the recent di&s;covery of this forgotten will, and the allegations annexed to it, throw con&s;iderable light on the dome&s;tic life of Milton; and the more in&s;ight we can gain into his &s;ocial and &s;eque&s;tered
<PB N="194" REF="217">
hours, the more we &s;hall di&s;cover, that he was not le&s;s entitled to private affection, than to public e&s;teem; but let us contemplate his per&s;on before we proceed to a minuter examination of his mind and manners.</P>
<P>So infatuated with rancour were the enemies of this illu&s;trious man, that they delineated his form, as they re|pre&s;ented his character, with the utmo&s;t extravagance of malevolent fal&s;hood: he was not only compared to that mon&s;ter of deformity, the eyele&s;s Polypheme, but de&s;cribed as a diminutive, bloodle&s;s, and &s;hrivelled creature. Expre&s;|&s;ions of this kind, in which ab&s;urdity and malice are equally apparent, induced him to expo&s;e the contemptible virulence of his revilers by a brief de&s;cription of his own figure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Veniamus nunc ad mea crimina; e&s;tne quod in vita aut moribus reprehendat?

which he could not reli&s;h; but he con&s;oled him&s;elf under ab&s;urd raillery on the delicacy of his per&s;on, by recollecting that &s;imilar raillery had been lavi&s;hed on tho&s;e manly and eminent characters of the ancient world, Demo&s;thenes and Horten&s;ius. His general appearance approached not in any degree to effeminacy.

<P>"An ancient clergyman of Dor&s;et&s;hire (Dr. Wright) found John Milton in a &s;mall chamber hung with ru&s;ty green, &s;itting in an elbow chair, and dre&s;&s;ed neatly in black, pale but not cadaverous, his hands and fingers gouty and with chalk &s;tones."</P>
<P>"He u&s;ed al&s;o to &s;it, in a grey coar&s;e cloth coat, at the door of his hou&s;e near Bunhill-fields, in warm &s;unny weather, to enjoy the fre&s;h air, and &s;o, as well as in his room, received the vi&s;its of people of di&s;tingui&s;hed parts as well as quality." It is probable, that Milton, in his youth, was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, indebted to the engaging graces of his per&s;on for that early introduction into the polite&s;t &s;ociety, both in England and abroad, which improved the natural &s;weetne&s;s of his character (&s;o vi&s;ible in all his genuine portraits) and led him to unite with profound erudition, and with the &s;ublime&s;t talents, an endearing and cheerful
<PB N="197" REF="220">
delicacy of manners, very rarely attained by men, who&s;e application to &s;tudy is continual and inten&s;e.</P>
<P>The enemies of Milton indeed (and his late biographer I mu&s;t reluctantly include under that de&s;cription) have la|boured to fix upon him a fictitious and mo&s;t unamiable character of au&s;terity and har&s;hne&s;s. <Q>What we know (&s;ays John&s;on) of Milton's character in dome&s;tic relations is, that he was &s;evere and arbitrary. His family con&s;i&s;ted of women, and there appears in his books &s;omething like a Turki&s;h contempt of females, as &s;ubordinate and infe|rior beings; that his own daughters might not break the ranks, he &s;uffered them to be depre&s;&s;ed by a mean and penurious education. He thought woman made only for obedience, and man for rebellion.</Q> This is a&s;&s;uredly the intemperate language of hatred, and very far from being con&s;onant to truth.</P>
<P>As it was thought a &s;ufficient defence of Sophocles, when he was barbarou&s;ly accu&s;ed of mental imbecility by his un|natural children, to read a portion of his recent dramatic works, &s;o, I am confident, the citation of a few ver&s;es from our Engli&s;h bard may be enough to clear him from a charge equally groundle&s;s, and almo&s;t as ungenerous.</P>
<P>No impartial reader of genuine &s;en&s;ibility will deem it po&s;&s;ible, that the poet could have entertained a Turki&s;h contempt of females, who has thus delineated woman:
<Q><L>All higher knowledge in her pre&s;ence falls</L>
<L>Degraded; wi&s;dom, in di&s;cour&s;e with her,</L>
<L>Lo&s;es di&s;countenanc'd, and like folly &s;hews;</L>
<L><PB N="198" REF="221">Authority and rea&s;on on her wait,</L>

<L>Build in her lovelie&s;t, and create an awe</L>
<L>About her, as a guard angelic plac'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>A de&s;cription &s;o complete could ari&s;e only from &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite feelings in the poet, as in&s;ured to every de&s;erving female his tendere&s;t regard. This argument might be &s;till more enforced by a pa&s;&s;age in the &s;peech of Raphael; but the preceding ver&s;es are, I tru&s;t, &s;ufficient to counteract the uncandid attempt of the acrimonious biographer to preju|dice the faire&s;t part of the creation again&s;t a poet, who has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his peers in delineating their charms, who&s;e poetry, a more enchanting mirror than the lake that he de&s;cribes in Paradi&s;e, repre&s;ents their mental united to their per&s;onal graces, and exhibits in perfection all the loveline&s;s of woman.</P>
<P>As to Milton's depre&s;&s;ing his daughters by a mean and penurious education, it is a calumny re&s;ting only on a report, that he would not allow them the advantage of learn|ing to write. This is evidently fal&s;e, &s;ince Aubrey, who was per&s;onally acquainted with the poet, and who had pro|bably con&s;ulted his widow in regard to many particulars of his life, expre&s;sly affirms, that his younge&s;t daughter was his amanuen&s;is; a circum&s;tance of which my friend Romney has happily availed him&s;elf to decorate the folio edition of this life with a production of his pencil.

daughter of Milton had the mo&s;t frequent opportunities of knowing his temper, and &s;he happens to be the only one of his children who has delivered a deliberate account of it; but her account, in&s;tead of confirming John&s;on's idea of her fa|ther's dome&s;tic &s;everity, will appear to the candid reader to refute it completely. "She &s;poke of him (&s;ays Richard|&s;on) with great tenderne&s;s; &s;he &s;aid he was delightful com|pany, the life of the conver&s;ation, and that on account of a flow of &s;ubject, and an unaffected cheerfulne&s;s and civility." It was this daughter who related the extraordinary circum|&s;tance, that &s;he and one of her &s;i&s;ters read to their father &s;everal languages, which they did not under&s;tand: it is re|markable, that &s;he did not &s;peak of it as a hard&s;hip; nor could it be thought an intolerable grievance by an af|fectionate child, who thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted a blind parent in labour|ing for the maintenance of his family. Such an employ|ment, however, mu&s;t have been irk&s;ome; and the con&s;iderate father, in finding that it was &s;o, "&s;ent out his children (according to the expre&s;&s;ion of his nephew) to learn &s;ome curious and ingenious &s;orts of manufacture, particularly em|broideries in gold or &s;ilver." That he was no penurious parent is &s;trongly proved by an expre&s;&s;ion that he made u&s;e of in &s;peaking of his will, when he declared, that "he had made provi&s;ion for his children in his life-time, and had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his e&s;tate in providing for them." It is the more barbarous to arraign the poet for dome&s;tic cruelty, becau&s;e he appears to have &s;uffered from the &s;ingular tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity of his nature. He had rea&s;on to lament that exce&s;s of indulgence, with which
<PB N="200" REF="223">
forgave and received again his di&s;obedient and long-alie|nated wife, &s;ince their re-union not only di&s;quieted his days, but gave birth to daughters, who &s;eem to have inhe|rited the perver&s;ity of their mother:

The&s;e pathetic lines, in a &s;peech of his Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes, &s;trike me as a forcible allu&s;ion to his own connubial infeli|city. If in his fir&s;t marriage he was eminently unhappy, his &s;ucce&s;s in the two la&s;t turned the balance of fortune in his favour. That his &s;econd wife de&s;erved, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and re|tained his affection, is evident from his &s;onnet occa&s;ioned by her death; of the care and kindne&s;s which he had long ex|perienced from the partner of his declining life, he &s;poke with tender gratitude to his brother, in explaining his te&s;ta|mentary intention; and we are probably indebted to the care and kindne&s;s, which the aged poet experienced from this affectionate guardian, for the happy accompli&s;hment of his ine&s;timable works. A blind and de&s;olate father mu&s;t be utterly unequal to the management of di&s;obedient daugh|ters con&s;piring again&s;t him; the angui&s;h he endured from their filial ingratitude, and the ba&s;e deceptions, with which they continually tormented him, mu&s;t have rendered even the &s;tronge&s;t mind very unfit for poetical application. The
<PB N="201" REF="224">
which he concluded by the advice and the aid of his friend Dr. Paget, &s;eems to have been his only re&s;ource again&s;t a mo&s;t exa&s;perating and calamitous &s;pecies of dome&s;|tic di&s;quietude; it appears, therefore, not unrea&s;onable to regard tho&s;e immortal poems, which recovered tranquillity enabled him to produce, as the fruits of that marriage. As matrimony has, perhaps, annihilated many a literary de&s;ign, let it be remembered to its honour, that it probably gave birth to the brighte&s;t offspring of literature.</P>
<P>The two elde&s;t daughters of Milton appear to me utterly unworthy of their father; but tho&s;e who adopt the dark prejudices of John&s;on, and believe with him, that the great poet was an au&s;tere dome&s;tic tyrant, will find, in their idea of the father, an apology for his children, who&s;e de&s;tiny in the world I &s;hall immediately mention, that I may have oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak of them no more. Anne, the elde&s;t, who with a deformed per&s;on had a plea&s;ing face, married an archi|tect, and died, with her fir&s;t infant, in child-bed. Mary, the &s;econd, and apparently the mo&s;t deficient in affection to her father, died unmarried. Deborah, who was the favourite of Milton, and who, long after his decea&s;e, di&s;covered, on a ca&s;ual &s;ight of his genuine portrait, very affecting emo|tions of filial tenderne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m, even Deborah de|&s;erted him without his knowledge, not in con&s;equence of his paternal &s;everity, of which &s;he was very far from com|plaining, but, as Richard&s;on intimates, from a di&s;gu&s;t &s;he had conceived again&s;t her mother-in-law. On quitting the hou&s;e of her father, &s;he went to Ireland with a lady, and afterwards became the wife of Mr. Clarke, a weaver, in
<PB N="202" REF="225">
Spital-fields. As her family was numerous, and her cir|cum&s;tances not affluent, the liberal Addi&s;on made her a pre|&s;ent, from his regard to the memory of her father, and in|tended to procure her &s;ome decent e&s;tabli&s;hment, but died before he could accompli&s;h his generous de&s;ign. From Queen Caroline, &s;he received fifty guineas, a donation as ill proportioned to the rank of the donor as to the mental dignity of the great genius, who&s;e indigent daughter was the object of this unprincely munificence.&mdash; Mrs. Clarke had ten children, but none of them appear to have attracted public regard, till Dr. Birch and Dr. Newton, two benevolent and re&s;pectable biographers of the poet, di&s;covered his grand-daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth Fo&s;ter, keep|ing a little chandler's-&s;hop in the city, poor, aged, and in|firm; they publicly &s;poke of her condition; John&s;on was then writing as the coadjutor of Lauder in his attempt to &s;ink the glory of Milton; but as the critic's charity was &s;till greater than his &s;pleen, he &s;eized the occa&s;ion of recom|mending, under Lauder's name, this nece&s;&s;itous de&s;cendant of the great poet to the beneficence of his country; Comus was repre&s;ented for her benefit, in the year 1750, and John|&s;on, to his honour, contributed a prologue on the occa&s;ion, in which noble &s;entiments are nobly expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The poor grand-daughter of Milton gained but one hun|dred and thirty pounds by this public benefaction; this &s;um, however, &s;mall as it was, afforded peculiar comfort to her declining age, by enabling her to retire to I&s;lington with her hu&s;band: &s;he had &s;even children, who died before her, and by her own death it is probable that the line of
<PB N="203" REF="226">
the poet became extinct. Let us ha&s;ten from this painful &s;urvey of his progeny to the more enlivening contemplation of his rare mental endowments. The mo&s;t diligent re|&s;earches into all that can elucidate the real temper of Milton only confirm the opinion, that his native characteri&s;tics were mildne&s;s and magnanimity. In controver&s;y his mind was undoubtedly overheated, and pa&s;&s;ages may be quoted from his pro&s;e works, that are certainly neither mild nor mag|nanimous; but if his controver&s;ial a&s;perity is compared with the outrageous in&s;olence of his opponents, even that a&s;perity will appear moderation; in &s;ocial intercour&s;e he is repre|&s;ented as peculiarly courteous and engaging. When the celebrity of his Latin work made him e&s;teemed abroad, many enquiries were made concerning his private character among his familiar acquaintance, and the re&s;ult of &s;uch en|quiry was, that mildne&s;s and affability were his di&s;tingui&s;h|ing qualities. "Virum e&s;&s;e miti comique ingenio aiunt," &s;ays the celebrate Hein&s;ius, in a letter that he wrote con|cerning Milton, in the year 1651, to Gronovius. Another eminent foreigner repre&s;ents him in the &s;ame plea&s;ing light, and from the be&s;t information. Vo&s;&s;ius, who was at that time in Sweden, and who mentions the prai&s;e, which his royal patrone&s;s Chri&s;tina be&s;towed on Milton's recent defence of the Engli&s;h people, informs his friend Hein&s;ius, that he had obtained a very particular account of the author from a relation of his own, the learned Junius, who wrote the elaborate and intere&s;ting hi&s;tory of ancient painting, re&s;ided in England, and particularly cultivated the intimacy of Milton.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="227">Indeed, when we reflect on the poet's uncommon tender|ne&s;s towards his parents, and all the advantages of his early life, both at home and abroad, we have every rea&s;on to be|lieve, that his manners were &s;ingularly plea&s;ing. He was fond of refined female &s;ociety, and appears to have been very fortunate in two female friends of di&s;tinction, the Lady Mar|garet Ley, who&s;e &s;ociety con&s;oled him when he was morti|fied by the de&s;ertion of his fir&s;t wife, and the no le&s;s accom|pli&s;hed Lady Ranelagh, who had placed her &s;on under his care, and who probably a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, when he was a wi|dower and blind, with friendly directions for the manage|ment of his female infants. A pa&s;&s;age in one of his letters to her &s;on &s;ugge&s;ts this idea; for he condoles with his young corre&s;pondent, then at the Univer&s;ity, on the lo&s;s they would both &s;u&s;tain by the long ab&s;ence of his mo&s;t excellent mother, pa&s;&s;ing at that time into Ireland; "her departure mu&s;t grieve us both," &s;ays Milton, "for to me al&s;o &s;he &s;up|plied the place of every friend<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nam et mihi omnium nece&s;&s;itudinum loco fuit.</NOTE>;" an expre&s;&s;ion full of tenderne&s;s and regret, highly honourable to the lady, and a plea&s;ing memorial of that &s;en&s;ibility and gratitude, which I am per&s;uaded we &s;hould have &s;een mo&s;t eminent in the cha|racter of Milton, if his Engli&s;h letters had been fortunately pre&s;erved, particularly his letters to this intere&s;ting lady, who&s;e merits are commemorated in an eloquent &s;ermon, preached by bi&s;hop Burnet, on the death of her brother, that mild and accompli&s;hed model of virtue and of learning, Robert Boyle.

Milton, however, did not form him&s;elf as a writer on any Roman model: being very early mo&s;t anxious to excel
<PB N="206" REF="229">
in literature, he wi&s;ely attached him&s;elf to tho&s;e prime examples of literary perfection, the Greeks; among the poets he particularly delighted in Euripides and Homer; his favourites in pro&s;e &s;eem to have been Plato and Demo&s;thenes; the fir&s;t peculiarly fit to give richne&s;s, purity, and lu&s;tre to the fancy; the &s;econd, to invigorate the under&s;tanding, and in&s;pire the fervid energy of public virtue. It is a very ju&s;t remark of Lord Monboddo, that even the poetical &s;peeches in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t derive their con&s;ummate propriety and elo|quence from the fond and enlightened attention with which the poet had &s;tudied the mo&s;t perfect orator of Athens: the &s;tudies of Milton, however, were very exten&s;ive; he appears to have been familiar not only with all the be&s;t authors of antiquity, but with tho&s;e of every refined language in Europe; Italian, French, Spani&s;h, and Portugueze. Great erudition has been often &s;uppo&s;ed to operate as an incum|brance on the finer faculties of the mind; but let us ob|&s;erve to its credit, the &s;ublime&s;t of poets was al&s;o the mo&s;t learned: of Italian literature he was particularly fond, as we may collect from one of his letters to a profe&s;&s;or of that lan|guage, and from the ea&s;e and &s;pirit of his Italian ver&s;es. To the honour of modern Italy it may be &s;aid, that &s;he had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in forming the genius of Milton. In Ta&s;&s;o, her brighte&s;t ornament, he found a character highly worthy of his affectionate emulation, both as a poet and as a man; this accompli&s;hed per&s;onage had, indeed, ended his illu&s;trious and troubled life &s;everal years before Milton vi&s;ited his country; but he was yet living in the memory of his ardent friend Man&s;o, and through the medium of Man&s;o's,
<PB N="207" REF="230">
conver&s;ation his various excellencies made, I am per&s;uaded, a forcible and permanent impre&s;&s;ion on the heart and fancy of our youthful countryman. It was hardly the example of Tri&s;&s;ino, as John&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, that tempted Milton to his bold experiment of blank ver&s;e; for Tri&s;&s;ino's epic poem is a very heavy performance, and had &s;unk into &s;uch oblivion in Italy, that the literary friend and biographer of Ta&s;&s;o con&s;iders that greater poet as the fir&s;t per&s;on who enriched the Italian language with valuable blank ver&s;e: "our early works of that kind," &s;ays Man&s;o, "are tran&s;lations from the Latin, and tho&s;e not &s;ucce&s;sful." The poem in blank ver&s;e, for which this amiable biographer applauds his friend, is an exten&s;ive work, in &s;even books, on the Seven Days of the Creation, a &s;ubject that has engaged the poets of many coun|tries. The performance of Ta&s;&s;o was begun at the hou&s;e of his friend Man&s;o, and at the &s;ugge&s;tion of a lady, the ac|compli&s;hed mother of the Marquis. As this poem is formed from the Bible, and full of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, it probably influenced the Engli&s;h vi&s;iter of Man&s;o in his choice of blank ver&s;e. Ta&s;&s;o was a voluminous author, and we have rea&s;on to believe that Milton was familiar with all his compo&s;i|tions, as the exqui&s;ite eulogy on connubial affection, in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, is founded on a pro&s;e compo&s;ition in favour of marriage, addre&s;&s;ed by the Italian poet to one of his re|lations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ta&s;&s;o begins this intere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e, by informing his kin&s;man Ercole, that he fir&s;t heard the news of his having taken a wife, and then was &s;urpri&s;ed by reading a compo|&s;ition of his, in which he inveighs not only again&s;t the ladies, but again&s;t matrimony. The poet, with great politene&s;s and &s;pirit, a&s;&s;umes the defence of both, and in the clo&s;e of a learned and eloquent panegyric, indulges his heart and fancy in a very animated and beautiful addre&s;s to wedded love, which Mil|ton has copied with his u&s;ual dignity and &s;weetne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>; but Milton, who was perhaps of all authors the
<PB N="208" REF="231">
addicted to imitation, rarely imitates even Ta&s;&s;o in compo&s;ition: in life, indeed, he copied him more clo&s;ely, and to his great poetical compeer of Italy he di&s;covers a very &s;triking re&s;emblance in application to &s;tudy, in tem|perance of diet, in purity of morals, and in fervency of devotion. The Marquis of Villa, in clo&s;ing his life of Ta&s;&s;o, has enumerated all the particular virtues by which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed; the&s;e were all equally con&s;picuous in Milton; and we may truly &s;ay of him, what Man&s;o &s;ays of the great Italian poet, that the preference of virtue to every other con&s;ideration was the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of his life.</P>
<P>Enthu&s;ia&s;m was the characteri&s;tic of his mind; in poli|tics, it made him &s;ometimes too generou&s;ly credulous, and &s;ometimes too rigorou&s;ly deci&s;ive; but in poetry it exalted him to &s;uch a degree of excellence as no man has hitherto &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; nor is it probable that in this province he will ever be excelled; for although in all the arts there are un|doubtedly points of perfection much higher than any mor|tal has yet attained, &s;till it requires &s;uch a coincidence of &s;o many advantages depending on the influence both of na|ture and of de&s;tiny to rai&s;e a great arti&s;t of any kind, that the world has but little rea&s;on to expect productions of poetical genius &s;uperior to the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t. There was a bold yet refined originality of conception, which cha|racteri&s;ed the mental powers of Milton, and give him the highe&s;t claim to di&s;tinction: we are not only indebted to him for having extended and ennobled the province of epic poetry, but he has another title to our regard, as the founder of that recent and enchanting Engli&s;h art, which has em|belli&s;hed

<P>The elegant hi&s;torian of modern gardening, Lord Or|ford, and the two accompli&s;hed poets, who have celebrated its charms both in France and England, De Lille and Ma|&s;on, have, with great ju&s;tice and felicity of expre&s;&s;ion, paid their homage to Milton, as the beneficent genius, who be|&s;towed upon the world this younge&s;t and mo&s;t lovely of the arts. As a contra&s;t to the Miltonic garden, I may point out to the notice of the reader, what has e&s;caped, I think, all the learned writers on this engaging &s;ubject, the garden of the imperious Duke of Alva, de&s;cribed in a poem of the ce|lebrated Lope de Vega. The &s;ublime vi&s;ion of Eden, as Lord Orford truly calls it, proves indeed, as the &s;ame writer ob|&s;erves, how little the poet &s;uffered from the lo&s;s of &s;ight. The native di&s;po&s;ition of Milton, and his per&s;onal infirmity, con&s;pired to make contemplation his chief bu&s;ine&s;s and chief enjoyment: few poets have devoted &s;o large a portion of their time to inten&s;e and regular &s;tudy; yet he often made a pau&s;e of &s;ome months in the progre&s;s of his great work, if we may confide in the circum&s;tantial narrative of his ne|phew. "I had the peru&s;al of it from the very beginning," &s;ays Philips, "for &s;ome years, as I went from time to time to vi&s;it him, in parcels of ten, twenty, or thirty ver&s;es at a time (which, being written by whatever hand came next,
<PB N="210" REF="233">
might po&s;&s;ibly want correction as to the orthography and pointing). Having, as the &s;ummer came on, not been &s;hewed any for a con&s;iderable while, and de&s;iring the rea&s;on thereof, was an&s;wered that his vein never happily flowed but from the autumual equinox to the vernal."</P>
<P>John&s;on takes occa&s;ion, from this anecdote, to treat the &s;en&s;ations of Milton with &s;arca&s;tic &s;everity, and to deride him for &s;ubmitting to the influence of the &s;ea&s;ons; he la|vi&s;hes ridicule, not le&s;s acrimonious, on the great poet, for having yielded to a fa&s;hionable dread of evils &s;till more fan|ta&s;tic. "There prevailed in his time (&s;ays the critic) an opi|nion that the world was in its decay, and that we have had the misfortune to be born in the decrepitude of nature." John&s;on expo&s;es, with great felicity of expre&s;&s;ion, this ab&s;urd idea, of which his own frame of body and mind was a com|plete refutation; but in&s;tead of deriding the great poet for harbouring &s;o weak a conceit, he might have recollected that Milton him&s;elf has &s;purned this chimera of timid ima|gination in very &s;pirited Latin ver&s;e, written in his twen|tieth year, and expre&s;sly again&s;t the folly of &s;uppo&s;ing na|ture impaired.</P>

to indulge him&s;elf in mu&s;ical relaxation after food, has been recently prai&s;ed as favourable to mental exertion, in producing all the good effects of &s;leep, with none of its di&s;advantages, by an illu&s;trious &s;cholar, who, like Milton, unites the pa&s;&s;ion and the talent of poetry to habits of in|ten&s;e and diver&s;ified application. Sir William Jones, in the third volume of A&s;iatic Re&s;earches, has recommended, from his own experience, this practice of Milton, who from mu|&s;ic returned to &s;tudy; at eight he took a light &s;upper, and at nine retired to bed.</P>
<P>If &s;uch extreme regularity could be pre&s;erved at any pe|riod, it mu&s;t have been in the clo&s;ing years of his life. While he was in office his time was undoubtedly much en|gaged, not only by official attendance, but by his inter|cour&s;e with learned foreigners, as the parliament allowed him a weekly table for their reception. The Latin com|po&s;itions of Milton had rendered him, on the continent, an object of idolatry; "and &s;trangers (&s;ays Wood, who was far from being partial to his illu&s;trious contemporary) vi|&s;ited the hou&s;e where he was born." Even in his latter days, when he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been neglected by his countrymen, intelligent foreigners were &s;olicitous to con|ver&s;e with him as an object of their curio&s;ity and venera|tion; they regarded him, and very ju&s;tly, as the prime wonder of England; for he was, in truth, a per&s;on &s;o ex|traordinary, that it may be que&s;tioned if any age or nation has produced his parallel. Is there, in the records of lite|rature, an author to be found, who, after gaining &s;uch ex|ten&s;ive celebrity as a political di&s;putant, ca&s;t off the mortal

of a polemic, and aro&s;e in the pure&s;t &s;plendor of poetical immortality?</P>
<P>Biographers are frequently accu&s;ed of being influenced by affection for their &s;ubject; to a certain degree it is right that they &s;hould be &s;o; for what is biography in its faire&s;t point of view? a tribute paid by ju&s;tice and e&s;teem to ge|nius and to virtue; and never is this tribute more plea&s;ing or more profitable to mankind, than when it is liberally paid, with all the fervor and all the fidelity of friend&s;hip: the chief delight and the chief utility that ari&s;es from this at|tractive branch of literature con&s;i&s;ts in the affectionate in|tere&s;t, which it di&s;plays and communicates in favour of the talents and probity that it a&s;pires to celebrate; hence the mo&s;t engaging pieces of biography are tho&s;e that have been written by relations of the decea&s;ed. This remark is ex|emplified in the life of Agricola by Tacitus, and in that of Racine, the dramatic poet, written by his &s;on, who was al&s;o a poet, and addre&s;&s;ed to his grand&s;on.</P>
<P>It has been the lot of Milton to have his life frequently de&s;cribed, and recently, by a very powerful author, who, had he loved the character he engaged to delineate, might, perhaps, have &s;atisfied the admirers of the poet, and clo&s;ed the li&s;t of his numerous biographers. But the very won|derful mind of John&s;on was &s;o embittered by prejudice, that in delineating a character confe&s;&s;edly pre-eminent in eminent accompli&s;hments, in genius, and in piety, he per|petually endeavours to repre&s;ent him as unamiable, and in|&s;tead of attributing any mi&s;taken opinions that he might entertain to &s;uch &s;ources as charity and rea&s;on con&s;pire to

&s;ugge&s;t, imputes them to &s;uppo&s;ed vices in his mind, mo&s;t foreign to his nature, and the very wor&s;t that an enemy could imagine.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this narrative I have con&s;idered it as a duty incumbent upon me to notice and counteract, as they occurred, many important &s;trokes of the ho&s;tility which I am now la|menting; the&s;e become &s;till more remarkable in that por|tion of the biographer's labour to which I am at length arrived; it is in diffecting the mind of Milton, if I may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, that John&s;on indulges the injurious in|temperance of his hatred. <Q>It is to be &s;u&s;pected (he &s;ays) that his predominant de&s;ire was to de&s;troy rather than e&s;tabli&s;h; and that he felt not &s;o much the love of li|berty as repugnance to authority.</Q> Such a &s;u&s;picion may indeed be harboured by political rancour, but it mu&s;t be in direct oppo&s;ition to ju&s;tice and truth; for of all men who have written or acted in the &s;ervice of liberty, there is no individual, who has proved more completely, both by his language and his life, that he made a perfect di&s;tinction between liberty and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. No human &s;pirit could be more &s;incerely a lover of ju&s;t and beneficent authority; for no man delighted more in peace and order; no man has written more eloquently in their prai&s;e, or given &s;ub|limer proofs of his own per&s;onal attachment to them by the regulation of his own orderly and peaceful &s;tudies. If he hated power (as John&s;on a&s;&s;erts) in every e&s;tabli&s;hed form, he hated not its &s;alutary influence, but its pernicious exer|tions. Vehement as he occa&s;ionally was again&s;t kings and prelates, he &s;poke of the &s;ectaries with equal indignation
<PB N="215" REF="238">
and abhorrence when they al&s;o became the agents of per&s;e|cution; and as he had fully &s;een, and has forcibly expo&s;ed, the gro&s;s failings of republican reformers, had his life been extended long enough to witne&s;s the Revolution, which he might have beheld without &s;uffering the decre|pitude or imbecility of extreme old age, he would probably have exulted as warmly as the &s;taunche&s;t friend of our pre|&s;ent con&s;titution can exult, in that temperate and happy reformation of monarchical enormities.</P>
<P>John&s;on al&s;o intimates, that he was a &s;hallow politician, who &s;uppo&s;ed money to be the chief good, though with &s;ingular incon&s;i&s;tency he at the &s;ame time confe&s;&s;es, "that fortune &s;eems not to have had much of his care."</P>
<P>Money, in fact, had &s;o little influence over the elevated mind of Milton, that from his want of attention to it he &s;u&s;tained &s;uch lo&s;&s;es as, according to his nephew's expre&s;|&s;ion, "might have ruined a man le&s;s temperate than he was." Two thou&s;and pounds he is &s;aid to have lo&s;t by en|tru&s;ting it to government, and as much in a private loan, without &s;ufficient &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>"Towards the latter part of his time," &s;ays one of his early biographers, "he contracted his library, both becau&s;e the heirs he left could not make a right u&s;e of it, and that he thought he might fell it more to their advantage than they could be able to do them&s;elves. His enemies reported, that poverty con&s;trained him thus to part with his books; and were this true it would be a great di&s;grace, not to him (for per&s;ons of the highe&s;t merits have been often reduced to that condition) but to any country that &s;hould have no more
<PB N="216" REF="239">
to probity or learning. This &s;tory, however, is &s;o fal&s;e, that he died worth fifteen hundred pounds, be&s;ides all his goods."</P>
<P>Such are the remarks of Toland on the pecuniary cir|cum&s;tances of the poet; they &s;hew with becoming &s;pirit, that he was not reduced by ab&s;olute indigence to the &s;ale of his library; yet every reader, who&s;e literary feelings are acute, mu&s;t regret, that the old age of Milton was not guarded and enlivened by &s;uch affluence as might have &s;aved him from a mea&s;ure, in which tho&s;e who have a pa&s;&s;ion for books mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him to have &s;uffered &s;ome degree of mortification.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ities into which many de&s;erving men of letters have fallen towards the clo&s;e of life, and in various countries, may be regarded as an univer&s;al di&s;grace to civilized &s;ociety, which the improving refinement and liberality of mankind ought effectually to remove. Literature, which is &s;o emi|nently beneficial to a nation, is frequently ruinous to worthy individuals mo&s;t fervently attached to it; and it &s;hould be regarded as a duty, therefore, by every poli&s;hed people, to provide a public fund, which might afford a becoming com|petence to the advanced life of every illu&s;trious &s;cholar, who&s;e public labours entitle him to that honourable di&s;tinc|tion. Such meritorious veterans in literature as Milton and his late aged biographer &s;hould have been pre&s;erved, in their declining days, from every &s;hadow of indigence, by the public gratitude of the nation to whom they had devoted their intellectual &s;ervice.

life of &s;uch authors, however he might condemn the ex|ce&s;&s;es of republican &s;everity in the one, or tho&s;e of &s;ervile and cen&s;orial bigotry in the other?</P>
<P>There can hardly be any contemplation more painful, than to dwell on the virulent exce&s;&s;es of eminent and good men; yet the utility of &s;uch contemplation may be equal to its pain. What mildne&s;s and candour &s;hould it not in&s;til ordinary into mortals to ob&s;erve, that even genius and virtue weaken their title to re&s;pect, in proportion as they recede from that evangelical charity, which &s;hould influence every man in his judgment of another.</P>
<P>The &s;trength and the acutene&s;s of &s;en&s;ation, which partly con&s;titute genius, have a great tendency to produce viru|lence, if the mind is not perpetually on its guard again&s;t that &s;ubtle, in&s;inuating, and corro&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion, hatred again&s;t all who&s;e opinions are oppo&s;ite to our own. John&s;on pro|fe&s;&s;ed, in one of his letters, to love a good hater; and in the Latin corre&s;pondence of Milton, there are words that imply a &s;imilarity of &s;entiment; they both thought there might be a &s;anctified bitterne&s;s, to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion of Milton, to|wards political and religious opponents; yet &s;urely the&s;e two devout men were both wrong, and both in &s;ome degree unchri&s;tian in this principle. To what &s;ingular iniquities of judgment &s;uch a principle may lead, we might, perhaps, have had a mo&s;t &s;triking, and a double proof, had it been po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e two energetic writers to exhibit alternately a portrait of each other. Milton, adorned with every grace|ful endowment, highly and holily accompli&s;hed as he was, appears, in the dark colouring of John&s;on, a mo&s;t unamia|ble
<PB N="218" REF="241">
being; but could he revi&s;it earth in his mortal charac|ter, with a wi&s;h to retaliate, what a picture might be drawn, by that &s;ublime and offended genius, of the great mo|rali&s;t, who has treated him with &s;uch exce&s;s of a&s;perity. The pa&s;&s;ions are powerful colouri&s;ts, and marvellous adepts in the art of exaggeration; but the portraits executed by love (famous as he is for overcharging them) are infinitely more faithful to nature, than gloomy &s;ketches from the heavy hand of hatred; a pa&s;&s;ion not to be tru&s;ted or indulged even in minds of the highe&s;t purity or power; &s;ince hatred, though it may enter the field of conte&s;t under the banner of ju&s;tice, yet generally becomes &s;o blind and outrageous, from the heat of contention, as to execute, in the name of virtue, the wor&s;t purpo&s;es of vice. Hence ari&s;es that &s;pecies of calumny the mo&s;t to be regretted, the calumny lavi&s;hed by men of talents and worth on their equals or &s;uperiors, whom they have ra&s;hly and blindly hated for a difference of opi|nion. To &s;uch hatred the fervid and oppo&s;ite characters, who gave ri&s;e to this ob&s;ervation, were both more inclined, perhaps, by nature and by habit, than chri&s;tianity can allow. The freedom of the&s;e remarks on two very great, and equally devout, though different writers, may po&s;&s;ibly offend the partizans of both: in that ca&s;e my con&s;olation will be, that I have endeavoured to &s;peak of them with that tempe|rate, though undaunted &s;incerity, which may &s;atisfy the &s;pirit of each in a purer &s;tate of exi&s;tence. There is one charac|teri&s;tic in Milton, which ought to be con&s;idered as the chief &s;ource of his happine&s;s and his fame; I mean his early and perpetual attachment to religion. It mu&s;t gratify every
<PB N="219" REF="242">
chri&s;tian to reflect, that the man of our country mo&s;t emi|nent for energy of mind, for inten&s;ene&s;s of application, and for frankne&s;s and intrepidity in a&s;&s;erting whatever he be|lieved to be the cau&s;e of truth, was &s;o confirmedly devoted to chri&s;tianity, that he &s;eems to have made the Bible, not only the rule of his conduct, but the prime director of his genius. His poetry flowed from the &s;cripture, as if his un|paralleled poetical powers had been expre&s;sly given him by Heaven for the purpo&s;e of imparting to religion &s;uch lu&s;tre as the mo&s;t &s;plendid of human faculties could be&s;tow. As in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t he &s;eems to emulate the &s;ublimity of Mo&s;es and the prophets, it appears to have been his wi&s;h, in the Paradi&s;e Regained, to copy the &s;weetne&s;s and &s;impli|city of the milder evangeli&s;ts. If the futile remarks that were made upon the latter work, on its fir&s;t appearance, excited the &s;pleen of the great author, he would probably have felt &s;till more indignant, could he have &s;een the com|ment of Warburton. That di&s;gu&s;ting writer, who&s;e criti|cal dictates form a fanta&s;tic medley of arrogance, acutene&s;s, and ab&s;urdity, has a&s;&s;erted, that the plan of Paradi&s;e Re|gained is very unhappy, and that nothing was ea&s;ier than to have invented a good one.</P>
<P>Much idle cen&s;ure &s;eems to have been thrown on more than one of Milton's poetical works, from want of due atten|tion to the chief aim of the poet:&mdash;if we fairly con&s;ider it in regard to Paradi&s;e Regained, the aim I allude to, as it probably occa&s;ioned, will completely ju&s;tify, the plan which the pre&s;umptuous critic has &s;o &s;uperciliou&s;ly condemned. Milton had already executed one exten&s;ive divine poem,
<PB N="220" REF="243">
peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed by richne&s;s and &s;ublimity of de&s;crip|tion; in framing a &s;econd, he would naturally wi&s;h to vary its effect; to make it rich in moral &s;entiment, and &s;ublime in its mode of unfolding the highe&s;t wi&s;dom that man can learn; for this purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep all the orna|mental parts of the poem in due &s;ubordination to the precep|tive. This delicate and difficult point is accompli&s;hed with &s;uch felicity, they are blended together with &s;uch exqui&s;ite harmony and mutual aid, that in&s;tead of arraigning the plan, we might rather doubt if any po&s;&s;ible change could improve it; a&s;&s;uredly, there is no poem of epic form, where the &s;ublime&s;t moral in&s;truction is &s;o forcibly and abundantly united to poetical delight: the &s;plendour of the poet does not blaze, indeed, &s;o inten&s;ely as in his larger production; here he re&s;embles the Apollo of Ovid, &s;oftening his glory in &s;peaking to his &s;on, and avoiding to dazzle the fancy, that he may de&s;cend into the heart. His dignity is not im|paired by his tenderne&s;s. The Paradi&s;e Regained is a poem, that de&s;erves to be particularly recommended to ardent and ingenuous youth, as it is admirably calculated to in&s;pire that &s;pirit of &s;elf-command, which is, as Milton e&s;teemed it, the true&s;t heroi&s;m, and the triumph of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to enter into a critical analy&s;is of the beauties and the blemi&s;hes that are vi&s;ible in the poetry of Milton, not only becau&s;e Addi&s;on and John&s;on have both written admirably on his greate&s;t work, but becau&s;e my mo&s;t excellent friend, the poet (who&s;e &s;pirit I e&s;teem mo&s;t congenial to that of Milton) is engaged in &s;uch illu&s;|tration of his honoured predece&s;&s;or; I &s;hall therefore con|fine
<PB N="221" REF="244">
my&s;elf to a &s;ingle e&s;&s;ay, detached from this narrative, under the title of "Conjectures on the Origin of the Para|di&s;e Lo&s;t."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, omit to &s;peak here, as I have engaged to do, of the character be&s;towed by John&s;on on the princi|pal performance of the poet; the greate&s;t part of that cha|racter is, perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;plendid tribute that was ever paid by one powerful mind to another. Ari&s;totle, Longinus, and Quintilian, have not &s;poken of their favourite Homer with more magnificence of prai&s;e; yet the character, taken alto|gether, is a golden image, that has lower parts of iron and of clay. The critic &s;eems to prepare a diadem of the riche&s;t jewels; he places them, mo&s;t liberally, on the head of the poet; but in the moment of adju&s;ting his radiant gift, he breathes upon it &s;uch a vapour of &s;pleen, as almo&s;t annihi|lates its lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>After di&s;playing, in the noble&s;t manner, many of the pe|culiar excellencies in the poem, he &s;ays, "its peru&s;al is a duty rather than a plea&s;ure; we read Milton for in&s;truction, retire hara&s;&s;ed and overburthened, and look el&s;ewhere for recreation; we de&s;ert our ma&s;ter, and &s;eek for compa|nions."</P>
<P>Injurious as the&s;e remarks are to the poet, let us a&s;cribe them, not to the virulence of intended detraction, but to the want of poetical &s;en&s;ibility in the critic; a want that may be &s;ufficiently proved, by comparing this account of the effect produced by Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t on his own feelings with its effect on a &s;pirit truly poetical. That enchanting poem, The Ta&s;k, very happily furni&s;hes &s;uch an illu&s;tration; it is
<PB N="222" REF="245">
thus that a mind attuned by nature to poetry de&s;cribes the effect in que&s;tion, as produced even in childhood.</P>
<Q><L>Then Milton had indeed a poet's charms</L>
<L>New to my ta&s;te; his Paradi&s;e &s;urpa&s;&s;ed</L>
<L>The &s;trugg'ling efforts of my boyi&s;h tongue</L>
<L>To &s;peak its excellence: I danc'd for joy.</L></Q>
<P>But the little delight that John&s;on confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to have taken in the poetry of Milton was rather his misfor|tune than his fault; it merits pity more than reproach, as it partly aro&s;e from con&s;titutional infelicity, and the very wide difference between the native turn of his mind and that of the poet: never were two &s;pirits le&s;s congenial, or two chri&s;tian &s;cholars, who differed more completely in their &s;entiments of poetry, politics, and religion. In tempera|ment, as well as in opinions, they were the rever&s;e of each other; the one was &s;anguine to exce&s;s, the other melan|choly in the extreme. Milton
<Q>Might &s;it in the centre and enjoy bright day;</Q>
but John&s;on,
<Q><L>Benighted walk'd under the mid-day &s;un;</L>
<L>Him&s;elf was his own dungeon.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such was the great contra&s;t between the&s;e two extraor|dinary men, that although they were both equally &s;incere in their attachment to chri&s;tianity, and both di&s;tingui&s;hed by
<PB N="223" REF="246">
noble intellectual exertions in the &s;ervice of mankind, the critic was naturally di&s;qualified from being a fair and a per|fect judge of the poet. My regard for a departed and me|ritorious writer (of great powers, but con&s;titutionally un|happy) is &s;uch, that I would rather a&s;cribe to any cau&s;e, than to mere envious malignity, his outrages again&s;t the poetical glory of Milton, which, from the force and celebrity of the very admirable but too au&s;tere work that contains them, it becomes the duty of a more recent biographer to expo&s;e.</P>
<P>For example, when John&s;on &s;ays that Milton "wrote no language, but formed a Babyloni&s;h dialect, har&s;h and barbarous," though it would be difficult to pronounce a critical cen&s;ure more bitter or more injurious, we may im|pute it, not to a malevolent de&s;ire of depreciating the poet, but to a natural want of ear for that harmony, which the critic condemns as di&s;cord. On this article, the mo&s;t harmonious of our bards has been very happily vindicated by men of &s;cience and ta&s;te. Dr. Fo&s;ter and Lord Mon|boddo have &s;hewn Milton to be one of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate artificers of language, that ever gave either energy or grace to words; and Mr. Loft, in the preface to his recent edition of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, de&s;cribes the maje&s;tic flow of his numbers with &s;uch truth and eloquence, as render ample ju&s;tice to the in&s;ulted dignity of the poet.</P>
<P>The in&s;ult, gro&s;s as it may be thought, lo&s;es much of its force when we recollect the incon&s;i&s;tency of the critic, who, though in his latter work he condemns the language of Milton as har&s;h and barbarous, had before ob&s;erved, with
<PB N="224" REF="247">
more truth, in the Rambler, that the poet "excelled as much in the lower as in the higher parts of his art, and that his &s;kill in harmony was not le&s;s than his invention or his learning;" but the prai&s;e as well as the cen&s;ure of John&s;on, on this article, could not be the re&s;ult of perfect percep|tion, for the monotony of his own blank ver&s;e, and &s;ome of his remarks in the Rambler on particular lines of Milton, are &s;triking proofs, that although he was a melodious writer him&s;elf in the common mea&s;ures of rhyme, and in digni|fied pro&s;e, yet he never entered with perfect intelligence and feeling into the mu&s;ical graces of Miltonic com|po&s;ition; he was, indeed, as far from enjoying the poet's ear for the varied modulations and exten&s;ive compa&s;s of metrical harmony, as he was from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mild elegance of his manners, or the cheerful elevation of his mind.</P>
<P>There is a &s;triking re&s;emblance between the poetical and the moral character of Milton; they were both the re&s;ult of the fine&s;t di&s;po&s;itions for the attainment of excellence that nature could be&s;tow, and of all the advantages that ar|dour and per&s;everance in &s;tudy and di&s;cipline could add, in a long cour&s;e of years, to the beneficent prodigality of nature: even in infancy he di&s;covered a pa&s;&s;ion for glory; in youth he was attached to temperance; and, ar|riving at manhood, he formed the magnanimous de&s;ign of building a lofty name upon the mo&s;t &s;olid and &s;ecure foundation.</P>

<L>Freedom and peace to men.</L></Q>
<P>In a noble con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his powers and intentions, he was not afraid to give, in his early life, a mo&s;t &s;ingular promi&s;e to his country of producing &s;uch future works as might redound to her glory; and though &s;uch per&s;onal ca|lamities fell upon him, as might fairly have ab&s;olved him from that engagement, yet never was any promi&s;e more mag|nificently fulfilled. Seneca has con&s;idered a man of re&s;o|lution &s;truggling with adver&s;ity as a &s;pectacle worthy of God; our re&s;olute countryman not only &s;truggled with ad|ver&s;ity, but, under a peculiar load of complicated cala|mities, he accompli&s;hed tho&s;e works, that are ju&s;tly reckoned among the noble&s;t offspring of human genius. In this point of view, with what pathetic grandeur is the poet inve&s;ted. In contemplating the variety of his &s;ufferings, and his vari|ous mental atchievements, we may declare, without any ex|travagance of prai&s;e, that although &s;ublimity is the predo|minant characteri&s;tic of Milton's poem, his own per&s;onal character is &s;till more &s;ublime.</P>
<P>His maje&s;tic pre-eminence is nobly de&s;cribed in the fol|lowing ver&s;es of Aken&s;ide, a poet who bore &s;ome affinity to Milton in the ardour of his mind, who&s;e &s;entiments are always noble, though not always accompanied by a graceful felicity of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>The powers of Milton, indeed, are &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, that even tho&s;e, whom the blindne&s;s of prejudice has rendered his enemies, are con&s;trained to regard him as an object of admiration. In this article po&s;terity, to whom he made a very intere&s;ting appeal, has done him ample ju&s;tice; &s;till he is more admired than beloved; yet in granting him only ad|miration, we ungenerou&s;ly withhold the riche&s;t half of that po&s;thumous reward for which he laboured &s;o fervently: we may be confident that he rather wi&s;hed to excite the af|fection than the applau&s;e of mankind; and a&s;&s;uredly he has the noble&s;t title to both, the title of having exerted &s;uper|lative genius and literary ambition, under the con&s;tant in|fluence of religious philanthropy. In proportion as our country has advanced in purity of ta&s;te, &s;he has applauded the poet; and in proportion as &s;he advances in liberality of &s;entiment, &s;he will love the man; but love in this a&s;pect is more volatile than admiration, and a beneficent genius may be ea&s;ily deprived of it by the detraction of an enemy, or
<PB N="227" REF="250">
the mi&s;take of a friend: Milton has &s;uffered not a little from both; and indeed, if one &s;ingular mi&s;take of his friends &s;hould prevail, he could hardly become an object of general affection. What votary of the Mu&s;es could love a poet, however excellent in that capacity, who repre&s;ented it as a crime in a captive monarch to have made the poetry of Shake&s;peare the companion of his &s;olitude? Credulity has imagined that Milton was &s;uch a barbarous Goth. Nor is this the &s;ugge&s;tion of his enemies; even Warton, the liberal defender of his poetical reputation, and &s;everal living writers of eminence, have lavi&s;hed their cen&s;ures on Mil|ton, from a too ha&s;ty belief, that puritanical prejudices had hurried him into this rancorous ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Their cen&s;ures are all founded on a mi&s;take; but the merit of correcting it belongs not to me; Mr. Waldron, the &s;en&s;ible and mode&s;t editor of a mi&s;cellany, entitled, The Literary Mu&s;eum, in a note to Ro&s;cius Anglicanus, has, in a very liberal manner, collected and refuted the charges again&s;t Milton on this point, and abundantly proved, that in&s;tead of cen&s;uring the unfortunate Charles for amu&s;ing him&s;elf with Shake&s;peare, he only cen&s;ured him for imitat|ing the religious hypocri&s;y of Richard the Third &s;o clo&s;ely as to utter the very &s;entiments that are a&s;&s;igned to Richard in the page of the dramatic poet.</P>
<P>Milton undoubtedly thought, what an ardent political writer of the pre&s;ent age has not &s;crupled to a&s;&s;ert, that "Charles the Fir&s;t lived and died an hypocrite." The&s;e two acute judges of mankind were, I believe, mi&s;taken in this idea: it &s;eems more probable, that this unfortunate
<PB N="228" REF="251">
prince was flattered into a per&s;ua&s;ion, that he was really the meritorious martyr his adherents endeavoured to repre|&s;ent him. But what&s;oever his genuine character might be, the &s;evere &s;entiments which Milton entertained of the king, and the delu&s;ive hopes that he cheri&s;hed of the protector, had equally their &s;ource in the virtuous ardour of his own &s;pirit. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his integrity, when time had fully unveiled to him &s;ome illu&s;ions, gave that tranquillity and vigour to his declining days, which enabled him to pro|duce his a&s;toni&s;hing poems, not more a&s;toni&s;hing for their intrin&s;ic merit, than for the period of their production; &s;o that his poetry, in this point of view, may be regarded both as the offspring and the witne&s;s of his virtue. The world had ne|ver been enriched with his two poems on Paradi&s;e, if their great author, when he was, according to his own true and pathetic de&s;cription,
<Q>In darkne&s;s and with dangers compa&s;s'd round,</Q>
had not, in &s;ome little degree, re&s;embled the hero of his latter poem, and like that hallowed per&s;onage, whom he delineates &s;o divinely, amid the darkne&s;s and the fiends of the de&s;ert,
<Q>Sat unappall'd in calm and &s;inle&s;s peace.</Q></P>
<P>Yet to &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations has the life and the poetry of Milton been expo&s;ed, that both have been con&s;idered as too au&s;tere to be amiable, though a&s;&s;uredly, both in the one
<PB N="229" REF="252">
and the other, the mo&s;t engaging qualities are admirably united to the mo&s;t aweful&mdash;the graceful and the tender to the grand and the &s;ublime.</P>
<P>The attractions of his mu&s;e have triumphed over oblo|quy, and in the e&s;timation of the world &s;he is ju&s;tly thought to re&s;emble the enchanting Eve of the poet,
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;Adorn'd</L>
<L>With what all earth or heav'n could be&s;tow</L>
<L>To make her amiable.</L></Q></P>
<P>But equal ju&s;tice has not hitherto been rendered to the per&s;onal virtues of the author; it has, therefore, been my chief aim, in a delineation of his life, to make Milton rather more beloved than more admired; and I may the more rea&s;onably hope to &s;ucceed in that idea, becau&s;e, though I have never been attached to his political opinions, yet, in proportion to my re&s;earches into his character as a man, he has advanced in my e&s;teem and my affection.</P>
<P>I lament that the nece&s;&s;ity of inve&s;tigating many mi&s;re|pre&s;entations, and of correcting much a&s;perity again&s;t him, has frequently obliged me to &s;peak rather in the tone of an advocate, than of a common biographer; but I may &s;ay, in the words of the great Roman author, pleading the cau&s;e of a poet infinitely le&s;s entitled to love and admiration; Hunc ego non diligam, non admirer, non omni ratione defenden|dum putem? Atque &s;ic a &s;ummis hominibus cruditi&s;&s;imis|que accepimus, caeterarum rerum &s;tudia et doctrina, et prae|ceptis, et arte con&s;tare; poetam natura ip&s;a valere, et men|tis

viribus excitari, et qua&s;i divino quodam &s;piritu afflari&mdash;if poetical powers may ever de&s;erve to be regarded as heavenly in&s;piration, &s;uch undoubtedly were tho&s;e of Milton, and the u&s;e to which he applied them was worthy of the fountain whence they flowed. He is pre-eminent in that cla&s;s of poets, very happily de&s;cribed in the two following ver&s;es by the amiable lord Falkland;
<Q><L>Who, while of heav'n the glories they recite,</L>
<L>Find it within, and feel the joys they write.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is by the epic compo&s;itions of Milton alone that Eng|land may e&s;teem her&s;elf as a rival to antiquity in the highe&s;t province of literature; and it appears therefore ju&s;t, that the memory of the man, to whom &s;he is indebted for the pure&s;t, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and permanent glory, &s;hould for ever excite her affectionate veneration.</P>

<P>TO write an Epic Poem was the prime object of MILTON's ambition at an early period of life; a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to his country made him fir&s;t think of celebrating its ancient heroes; but in the long interval between the dawn of &s;uch a project in his thoughts, and the commencement of his work, a new train of images got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fancy; Arthur yield|ed to Adam, and England to Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider what various cau&s;es might con&s;pire to pro|duce this revolution in the ideas of the great poet may be a plea&s;ing &s;peculation, if it is pur&s;ued with due re&s;pect to the noble mind that it a&s;pires to examine.</P>
<P>An inve&s;tigation of a &s;imilar nature was undertaken &s;ome years ago, upon very different principles, when a &s;in|gular attempt was made to annihilate the poetical glory of Milton, by proving him a plagiary. This attempt was &s;o extraordinary in its nature, and in its end &s;o honourable

to the poet and his country, that a brief account of it &s;hould, I think, be annexed to the Life of Milton, who&s;e admirers may &s;ay, on that occa&s;ion, to the &s;landerers of genius,

<P>I &s;hall give, therefore, a &s;ketch of the literary tran&s;|actions to which I allude, as an introduction to tho&s;e conjectures, that a long and affectionate attachment to Milton has led me to form, concerning the origin of his greate&s;t work.</P>
<P>In 1746, William Lauder, an unfortunate adventurer, whom a furious temper, con&s;iderable learning, and greater indigence, converted into an audacious impo&s;tor, attacked the originality of the chief Engli&s;h poet. Having a&s;|&s;erted, in a periodical mi&s;cellany, that Milton had bor|rowed all his ideas from the juvenile work of Grotius, or from other le&s;s known writers of Latin ver&s;e, and find|ing the novelty of his charge attract the attention of the public, he endeavoured to enforce it in a pamphlet, intitled, <Q>An E&s;&s;ay on Milton's U&s;e and Imitation of the Moderns,</Q> printed in 1750, and addre&s;&s;ed to the two univer&s;ities of Oxford and Cambridge. In the clo&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay he &s;crupled not to &s;ay of Milton:</P>
<P><Q>His indu&s;trious concealment of his helps, his pe|remptory di&s;claiming all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is highly ungenerous, nay criminal to the la&s;t degree, and ab&s;o|lutely unworthy of any man of common probity and
<PB N="235" REF="257">
honour. By this mean practice, indeed, he has acquired the title of the Briti&s;h Homer, nay, has been preferred to Homer and Virgil both, and con&s;equently to every other poet of every age and nation. Cowley, Waller, Denham, Dryden, Prior, Pope, in compari&s;on with Milton, have borne no greater proportion, than that of dwarfs to a giant, who, now he is reduced to his true &s;tandard, appears mortal and unin&s;pired, and in abi|lity little &s;uperior to the poets above-mentioned, but in hone&s;ty and open dealing, the be&s;t quality of the human mind, not inferior, perhaps, to the mo&s;t unli|cen&s;ed plagiary that ever wrote.</Q></P>
<P>In a publication, containing <HI>&s;uch language,</HI> Lauder was able to engage the great critic and morali&s;t, Samuel John&s;on, as his confederate; for the preface and po&s;t&s;cript to the E&s;&s;ay, from which the preceding paragraph is cited, are confe&s;&s;edly the compo&s;ition of that elaborate and nervous writer.</P>
<P>This confederacy, unbecoming as it may at fir&s;t ap|pear, will, on candid reflection, &s;eem rather a credit than a di&s;grace to John&s;on; for we certainly ought to believe that the primary motive, which prompted him to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lauder, was that true and noble compa&s;&s;ion for indigence, which made him through life &s;o gene|rou&s;ly willing to afford all the aid in his power to lite|rary mendicants; but in rendering ju&s;tice to that laud|able charity, which he con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed to the nece&s;|&s;itous, we cannot fail to ob&s;erve, that his malevolent
<PB N="236" REF="258">
prejudices again&s;t Milton were equally vi&s;ible on this &s;ignal occa&s;ion. Had he not been under the influence of &s;uch prejudice, could his &s;trong under&s;tanding have failed to point out to his a&s;&s;ociate, what a liberal monitor very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved to Lauder, in convicting him of fraud and fal&s;hood, that, allowing his facts to have been true, his inference from them was unfair. Lauder, with an unexampled audacity of impo&s;ture, had corrupted the text of the poets, whom he produced as evidence again&s;t Milton, by interpolating &s;everal ver&s;es, which he had taken from a neglected Latin tran&s;lation of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t. Expecting probably to e&s;cape both di&s;covery and &s;u&s;picion by the daring novelty of his deception, and the mental dignity of his patron and coadjutor, he exulted in the idea of bla&s;ting the laurels of Milton; but tho&s;e laurels were proof, indeed, again&s;t the furious and repeated fla&s;hes of malevolence and ho&s;tility. More than one defence of the injured poet appeared; the fir&s;t, I believe, was a pamphlet by Mr. Richard&s;on, of Clare Hall, printed in 1747, and entitled Zoiloma&s;tix, or, a Vindication of Milton, con&s;i&s;ting of letters in&s;erted in the mi&s;cellany, where the charge of Lauder had made its fir&s;t appearance; but the complete overthrow of that impo&s;tor was accom|pli&s;hed by Dr. Douglas, the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, who publi&s;hed, in 1750, a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Lord Bath, with the title of "Milton vindicated from the Charge of Plagiari&s;m;" a performance that, in many points of view, may be regarded as a real honour to literature&mdash;
<PB N="237" REF="259">
it unites what we find very rarely united in literary con|tention, great mode&s;ty with great fervour; and magna|nimous moderation with the &s;everity of vindictive ju&s;tice. The author &s;peaks with amiable liberality of Mr. Bowle, in &s;aying, <Q>that gentleman had fir&s;t collected materials for an an&s;wer to Lauder,</Q> and <Q>has the ju&s;te&s;t claim to the honour of being the original detector of this ungenerous critic.</Q> The writer of this valuable pamphlet gave al&s;o an admonition to John&s;on, which breathes the manly &s;pirit of intelligence, of ju&s;tice, and of candour. <Q>It is to be hoped (he &s;aid) nay it is to be expected, that the elegant and ner|vous writer, who&s;e judicious &s;entiments and inimi|table &s;tyle point out the author of Lauder's preface and po&s;t&s;cript, will no longer allow one to plume him|&s;elf with his feathers, who appeareth &s;o little to have de&s;erved his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; an a&s;&s;i&s;tance which, I am per|&s;uaded, would never have been communicated had there been the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of tho&s;e facts, which I have been the in&s;trument of conveying to the world in the&s;e &s;heets, a peru&s;al of which will &s;atisfy our critic, who was plea&s;ed to &s;ubmit his book to the judgment of the two univer&s;ities, that it has been examined and carefully read at lea&s;t by &s;ome members of the univer|&s;ity of Oxford.</Q> The defence of Milton, which I have mentioned, by Mr. Richard&s;on, proves al&s;o, for the honour of Cambridge, that <HI>her men of letters</HI> were by no means deficient in &s;uch regard, as they peculiarly owe to
<PB N="238" REF="260">
the reputation of the poet, who "flames in the van" of that poetical ho&s;t, which has contributed to her renown.</P>
<P>When the pamphlet of Dr. Douglas had completely unveiled the mo&s;t impudent of literary frauds, John&s;on, whom his prejudice again&s;t Milton could no longer ren|der blind to the unworthine&s;s of Lauder, recoiled from the wretch whom he had too credulou&s;ly befriended, and finding him as deficient in the truth of facts as he was in propriety of &s;entiment, and decency of language, made him addre&s;s to his antagoni&s;t, who had convicted him of &s;ome forgeries, an ample avowal of more exten|&s;ive fraud, and a mo&s;t humble &s;upplication for pardon. This expiatory addre&s;s was dictated by John&s;on, who&s;e conduct on the occa&s;ion was manly and moral&mdash;but it failed to correct his a&s;&s;ociate, for prejudice again&s;t Milton in Lauder aro&s;e almo&s;t to madne&s;s; in John&s;on it amounted only to a degree of malevolence, too commonly produced by political di&s;agreement; it had induced him to cheri&s;h too eagerly a detractive deception, fabricated to &s;ink an illu&s;trious character, without allowing him&s;elf the due exerci&s;e of his keen under&s;tanding to inve&s;ti|gate its fal&s;ehood, or to perceive its ab&s;urdity. Lauder &s;eems to have hoped, for &s;ome time, that a full con|fe&s;&s;ion of his offences would re&s;tore him to the favour of the public; for in the year 1751 he ventured to pub|li&s;h an apolgy, addre&s;&s;ed to the Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, &s;oliciting patronage for his projected edition of
<PB N="239" REF="261">
the &s;carce Latin authors, from whom he had accu&s;ed Milton of borrowing. The chief purpo&s;e of &s;o extraor|dinary an attack on the renown of the poet, appears to have been a de&s;ire, prompted by indigence, to intere&s;t the public in the re-appearance of the&s;e neglected writers, whom he meant to re-publi&s;h. In clo&s;ing his apology to the Archbi&s;hop, he &s;ays, with &s;ingular confidence:</P>
<P><Q>As for the interpolations (for which I am &s;o highly blamed) when pa&s;&s;ion is &s;ub&s;ided, and the minds of men can patiently attend to truth, I promi&s;e amply to replace them, with pa&s;&s;ages equivalent in value that are genuine, that the public may be convinced that it was rather pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment, than a penury of evi|dence, the twentieth part of which has not as yet been produced, that obliged me to make u&s;e of them.</Q></P>
<P>He printed the collection of Latin poets as he pro|po&s;ed, one volume in 1752, and a &s;econd in 1753. The book may be regarded as a literary curio&s;ity, but it &s;eems to have contributed little to the emolument of its mi&s;era|ble editor, who had thoroughly awakened univer&s;al in|dignation; and as Dr. Douglas ob&s;erved, in a po&s;t&s;cript to his pamphlet, reprinted in 1756, <Q>The curio&s;ity of the public to &s;ee any of the&s;e poems was at an end; the only thing which had &s;tamped a value upon them, was a &s;uppo&s;ition that Milton had thought them worthy of his imitation. As therefore it now appeared, by the de|tection of Lauder's &s;y&s;tem of forgery, that Milton had not imitated them, it is no wonder that the de&s;ign of
<PB N="240" REF="262">
reprinting them &s;hould meet with little or no &s;uc|ce&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ertion of this learned and amiable writer, that Milton had not imitated the&s;e poets, is not to be under|&s;tood in a &s;trict and literal &s;en&s;e; for a&s;&s;uredly there are pa&s;&s;ages in &s;ome of them that Milton may be fairly &s;up|po&s;ed to have copied, though his obligations to the&s;e Latin poets are very far from being con&s;iderable; and had they been infinitely greater, the inference drawn by the malevolent reviler of Milton would &s;till have been prepo&s;terou&s;ly &s;evere.</P>
<P>The detected &s;landerer was &s;oon overwhelmed with the utter contempt he de&s;erved; but, contemptible as he was, the memory of his offences and of his puni&s;hment ought to be pre&s;erved, not &s;o much for the honour of Milton, as for the general intere&s;t of literature, that if the world can produce a &s;econd Lauder, he may not hope for impunity.</P>
<P>Part of his &s;ub&s;equent hi&s;tory is related in the follow|ing words by Dr. Douglas:</P>
<P><Q>Grown de&s;perate by his di&s;appointment, this very man, whom but a little before we have &s;een as abject in the confe&s;&s;ion of his forgeries, as he had been bold in the contrivance of them, with an incon&s;i&s;tence, equalled only by his impudence, renewed his attack upon the author of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; and in a pamphlet, publi&s;hed for that purpo&s;e, acquainted the world, that the true rea&s;on which had excited him to
<PB N="241" REF="263">
contrive his forgery was, becau&s;e Milton had attacked the character of Charles the Fir&s;t, by interpolating Pamela's prayer from the Arcadia, in an edition of the Eicon Ba&s;ilike; hoping, no doubt, by this curious key to his conduct, to be received into favour, if not by the friends of truth, at lea&s;t by the idolaters of the royal martyr&mdash;the zeal of this wild party-man again&s;t Milton having at the &s;ame time extended it&s;elf again&s;t his biographer, the very learned Dr. Birch, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e he was &s;o candid as to expre&s;s his di&s;belief of a tradition un&s;upported by evidence.</Q></P>
<P>Were it requi&s;ite to give new force to the many proofs of that malignant prejudice again&s;t Milton in a late wri|ter, which I have had too frequent occa&s;ion to examine and regret, &s;uch force might be drawn from the words ju&s;t cited from Dr. Douglas. That gentleman here informs us, that Lauder directed his intemperate zeal again&s;t Dr. Birch, for rejecting the ill-&s;upported &s;tory that repre&s;ented Milton as an impo&s;tor, concerned in forging the remarkable prayer of the king. Yet John|&s;on ungenerou&s;ly laboured to fix this &s;u&s;picion of di&s;ho|ne&s;ty on the great character who&s;e life he delineated, by in&s;inuating that Dr. Birch believed the very &s;tory, which Lauder reviled him for having candidly rejected. Is it not too evident from this circum&s;tance, that Lauder's intemperate hatred of Milton had in &s;ome degree infected his noble coadjutor? though he very ju&s;tly di&s;carded
<PB N="242" REF="264">
that impo&s;tor, when convicted of forgery, after writing for him a &s;upplicatory confe&s;&s;ion of his fraud, for which he was afterwards cen&s;ured by the half-frantic offender, who, finding that it procured him no favour from the public, declared it infinitely too general and too abject for the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The malevolence of John&s;on towards the great poet has been repre&s;ented as a mere fiction of party rage, acrimoniou&s;ly reviling an illu&s;trious biographer: but in|&s;tead of being an injurious fiction of that evil &s;pirit, it is a reality univer&s;ally felt, and &s;incerely lamented by tho&s;e lovers of literature, who, being exempt from all party rage them&s;elves, would willingly annihilate the influence of that in&s;idious foe to truth and ju&s;tice in the republic of letters. It &s;hould afford us an antidote again&s;t the poi&s;on of party rage in all literary di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, to ob&s;erve, that by indulging it, a very &s;trong and a very devout mind was hurried into the want of clear moral perception, and of true Chri&s;tian charity, in de&s;cribing the conduct, and in &s;crutinizing the motives, of Milton. It &s;eems as if the good angel of this extraordinary poet had determined that his poetical renown &s;hould pa&s;s (like his virtue and his genius) through trials mo&s;t won|derfully adapted to give it lu&s;tre; and hence (as imagi|nation at lea&s;t may plea&s;e it&s;elf in &s;uppo&s;ing) hence might &s;uch enemies be combined again&s;t him, as the world, perhaps, never &s;aw before in a &s;imilar confederacy. A ba&s;e artificer of fal&s;ehood, and a magnanimous teacher of
<PB N="243" REF="265">
moral philo&s;ophy, united in a wild endeavour to dimini&s;h his reputation; but, like the ra&s;h a&s;&s;ailants of Jupiter, in the fables of pagani&s;m, they only confirmed the pre|eminence they attacked with prepo&s;terous temerity. The philo&s;opher, indeed, made an honourable retreat; and no candid mind will &s;everely cen&s;ure him for an ill-&s;tarred alliance, which, however clouded by prejudice, he might originally form in compa&s;&s;ion to indigence, and which he certainly ended by rejection of impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable Lauder was puni&s;hed by events &s;o cala|mitous, that even tho&s;e admirers of Milton, who are mo&s;t offended by the enormity of the fraud, mu&s;t wi&s;h that penitence and amendment had &s;ecured to this unhappy being, who &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable &s;cholar|&s;hip, a milder de&s;tiny. Finding him&s;elf unable to &s;trug|gle with public odium in this country, he &s;ought an a&s;ylum in the We&s;t Indies, and there died, an indigent outca&s;t, and a memorable example, how dangerous it is to incur the indignation of mankind, by ba&s;e devices to bla&s;t the reputation of departed genius.&mdash;May his wretched cata&s;trophe pre&s;erve the literary world from being di&s;honoured again by artifice &s;o dete&s;table!</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the collection be publi&s;hed of Latin poets is entitled to &s;ome regard as a literary curio&s;ity: and it may here be proper to enumerate the authors com|prized in that collection. The fir&s;t volume contains the Poemata Sacra of Andrew Ram&s;ay, from a copy printed at Edinburgh 1633; and the Adamus Exul of Grotius,
<PB N="244" REF="266">
from the edition of the Hague, 1601. In the &s;econd volume we have the Sarcotis of Ma&s;enius, from the edi|tion of Cologne, 1644, omitting the 4th and 5th books, which may be found in a copy of the Sarcotis printed at Paris, by Barbou, 1771: the fir&s;t book of Daemono|machia, a poem by Odoricus Valmarana, printed at Vienna, in 25 books, 1627: Paradi&s;us Jacobi Cat&s;ii, a celebrated Dutch poet&mdash;the Paradi&s;e of Cat&s;ius is a &s;pirited and graceful epithalamium on the nuptials of Adam and Eve, originally written in the native language of the author; this Latin ver&s;ion of it was executed by the learned Barlaeus, and fir&s;t printed in 1643: Bellum Angelicum Auctore Frederico Taubmanno; a poem, con|&s;i&s;ting of two books, and a fragment of a third, originally printed in 1604.</P>
<P>Lauder, in publi&s;hing this collection of curious Latin ver&s;e, has occa&s;ionally &s;ea&s;oned it with remarks of his own both in Latin and Engli&s;h&mdash;the tenor of them has a great tendency to confirm the apology, with which John&s;on excu&s;ed the implicit and ha&s;ty credit that he gave to the gro&s;s forgeries of the impo&s;tor: <Q>He thought the man too frantic to be fraudulent.</Q> The language u&s;ed by Lauder, in the publication I am &s;peaking of, &s;hews indeed that the contemptuous abhorrence, which this unhappy &s;cholar had conceived of Milton, really bor|dered upon in&s;anity. Without pointing to any particu|lar in&s;tances of plagiari&s;m, he be&s;tows on the poet the extraordinary title of the arch felon; and in&s;erts a &s;ingu|lar
<PB N="245" REF="267">
epigram, written by a &s;ervile foreigner, to prove Mil|ton an athei&s;t. Not contented with reviling the great author him&s;elf, he extends the virulent attack to his nephew Philips, whom he accu&s;es of having favoured, by a &s;u&s;picious &s;ilence, the &s;ecret practice of his uncle, in riffling the trea&s;ures of others. <Q>Philips (&s;ays Lauder) every where in his 'Theatrum Poetarum,' either wholly pa&s;&s;es over in &s;ilence &s;uch authors as Milton was mo&s;t obliged to, or, if he chances to mention them, does it in the mo&s;t &s;light and &s;uperficial manner imaginable.</Q></P>
<P>There is &s;ome acutene&s;s, and more truth, in this ob&s;er|vation concerning Philips, than Lauder was him&s;elf aware of. Though Milton was indeed no plagiary, and his nephew of cour&s;e had no thefts to conceal, it is very remarkable that Philips, giving an account of poets in all languages, omits &s;uch of their works as were built on &s;ubjects re&s;embling tho&s;e of his uncle. This omi&s;&s;ion is not only &s;triking in the brief account he gives of the Latin poets collected by Lauder; it extends to &s;ome Ita|lian writers, of whom I &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more at large. Let me fir&s;t ob&s;erve, in apology for the omi&s;&s;ions of Philips, which are too frequent to be con&s;idered as accidental, that he probably cho&s;e not to enumerate various poems relating to angels, to Adam, and to Paradi&s;e, le&s;t ignorance and malice &s;hould ab|&s;urdly con&s;ider the mere exi&s;tence of &s;uch poetry as a de|rogation from the glory of Milton. That Philips had
<PB N="246" REF="268">
him&s;elf no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of poetical ta&s;te, and that he was laudably zealous for the honour of his uncle, ap|pears, I think, from the following remarks, which I tran&s;cribe with plea&s;ure, from his preface to the little book I am &s;peaking of, as they &s;eem to contain an oblique and graceful compliment to his renowned rela|tion:&mdash;<Q>A poetical fancy is much &s;een in a choice of ver&s;e proper to a cho&s;en &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Wit, ingenuity, and learning in ver&s;e, even elegance it&s;elf, though that comes neare&s;t, are one thing, true native poetry is another, in which there is a certain air and &s;pirit, which, perhaps, the mo&s;t learned and judicious in other arts do not perfectly apprehend, much le&s;s is it attainable by any &s;tudy or indu&s;try.</Q></P>
<P>This certain air and &s;pirit are a&s;&s;uredly mo&s;t con|&s;picuous in Milton: he was a poet of nature's creation, but one who added to all her endowments every advan|tage that &s;tudy could acquire.</P>
<P>By the force and opulence of his own fancy he was exempted from the inclination and the nece&s;&s;ity of bor|rowing and retailing the ideas of other poets; but, rich as he was in his own proper fund, he cho&s;e to be perfectly acquainted, not only with the wealth, but even with the poverty of others. He &s;eems to have read, in different languages, authors of every cla&s;s; and I doubt not but he had peru&s;ed every poem collected by Lauder, though &s;ome of them hardly afford ground enough for a conjec|ture, that he remembered any pa&s;&s;age they contain, in the
<PB N="247" REF="269">
cour&s;e of his nobler compo&s;ition. John&s;on, in his preface to Lauder's pamphlet, repre&s;ents the Adamus Exul of Grotius as <Q>the fir&s;t draught, the <HI>prima &s;tamina</HI> of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</Q> The &s;ame critic ob&s;erves, in touching on this &s;ubject, in his life of Milton&mdash;<Q>Whence he drew the original de&s;ign has been variou&s;ly conjectured by men, who cannot bear to think them&s;elves ignorant of that, which, at la&s;t, neither diligence nor &s;agacity can di&s;cover. Some find the hint in an Italian tragedy. Voltaire tells a wild, unauthorized &s;tory of a farce &s;een by Milton in Italy, which opened thus: 'Let the rainbow be the fiddle-&s;tick of the fiddle of heaven'.</Q></P>
<P>The critic was perfectly right in relinqui&s;hing his for|mer idea concerning the Adamus Exul of Grotius; but, in his remark on Voltaire, he &s;hews how dangerous it is to cen&s;ure any writer for what he &s;ays concerning books, which the cen&s;urer has no opportunity of examining. Voltaire, indeed, from his predominant pa&s;&s;ion for ridi|cule, and from the ra&s;h vivacity, that often led him to &s;peak too confidently of various works from a very &s;light in&s;pection of their contents, is no more to be followed implicitly in points of critici&s;m, than he is on the more important article of religion: but his opinions in litera|ture are generally worth examination, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no common degree of ta&s;te, a perpetual thir&s;t for univer&s;al knowledge, and, though not the mo&s;t intimate, yet, per|haps, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive acquaintance with literary works
<PB N="248" REF="270">
and literary men that was ever acquired by any indi|vidual.</P>
<P>When Voltaire vi&s;ited England in the early part of his life, and was engaged in &s;oliciting a &s;ub&s;cription for his Henriade, which fir&s;t appeared under the title of <Q>The League,</Q> he publi&s;hed, in our language, an e&s;&s;ay on Epic Poetry, a work which, though written under &s;uch di&s;ad|vantage, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the peculiar vivacity of this extraordi|nary writer, and is indeed &s;o curious a &s;pecimen of his ver&s;atile talents, that although it has been &s;uper&s;eded by a French compo&s;ition of greater extent, under the &s;ame title, it ought, I think, to have found a place in that &s;ig|nal monument to the name of Voltaire, the edition of his works in ninety-two volumes.</P>
<P>As my reader may be gratified in &s;eeing the Engli&s;h &s;tyle of this celebrated foreigner, I will tran&s;cribe, with|out abridgment, what he &s;ays of Andreini:</P>
<Q><P>Milton, as he was travelling through Italy in his youth, &s;aw at Florence a comedy called Adamo, writ by one Andreini, a player, and dedicated to Mary de Medicis, Queen of France. The &s;ubject of the play was the Fall of Man; the actors, God, the devils, the angels, Adam, Eve, the Serpent, Death, and the &s;even mortal &s;ins: that topic, &s;o improper for a drama, but &s;o &s;uitable to the ab&s;urd genius of the Italian &s;tage (as it was at that time) was handled in a manner entirely conformable to the extravagance of the de&s;ign. The
<PB N="249" REF="271">
&s;cene opens with a chorus of angels, and a cherubim thus &s;peaks for the re&s;t:&mdash;'Let the rainbow be the fiddle-&s;tick of the fiddle of the heavens! let the pla|nets be the notes of our mu&s;ic! let time beat care|fully the mea&s;ure, and the winds make the &s;harps, &amp;c.' Thus the play begins, and every &s;cene ri&s;es above the la&s;t in profu&s;ion of impertinence!</P>
<P>Milton pierced through the ab&s;urdity of that perform|ance to the hidden maje&s;ty of the &s;ubject, which, being altogether unfit for the &s;tage, yet might be (for the genius of Milton, and for his only) the foundation of an epic poem.</P>
<P>He took from that ridiculous trifle the fir&s;t hint of the noble&s;t work, which human imagination has ever attempted, and which he executed more than twenty years after.</P>
<P>In the like manner, Pythagoras owed the invention of mu&s;ic to the noi&s;e of the hammer of a black&s;mith; and thus, in our days, Sir I&s;aac Newton, walking in his garden, had the fir&s;t thought of his &s;y&s;tem of gravita|tion upon &s;eeing an apple falling from a tree.</P></Q>
<P>It was thus that, in the year 1727, Voltaire, then &s;tudy|ing in England, and collecting all po&s;&s;ible information concerning our great epic poet, accounted for the origin of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t. Rolli, another foreign &s;tudent in epic poetry, who re&s;ided at that time in London, and was engaged in tran&s;lating Milton into Italian ver&s;e, publi&s;hed &s;ome &s;evere cen&s;ures, in Engli&s;h, on the Engli&s;h e&s;&s;ay of
<PB N="250" REF="272">
Voltaire, to vindicate both Ta&s;&s;o and Milton from certain &s;trictures of &s;arca&s;tic raillery, which the volatile French|man had lavi&s;hed upon both. Voltaire, indeed, has fallen him&s;elf into the very incon&s;i&s;tency, which he mentions as unaccountable in Dryden; I mean the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;ometimes prai&s;ing Milton with &s;uch admiration as approaches to idolatry, and &s;ometimes reproving him with &s;uch keenne&s;s of ridicule as borders on contempt. In the cour&s;e of this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion we may find, perhaps, a mode of accounting for the incon&s;i&s;tency both of Dryden and Voltaire; let us attend at pre&s;ent to what the latter has &s;aid of Andreini!&mdash;If the Adamo of this author really gave birth to the divine poem of Milton, the Italian dra|mati&s;t, whatever rank he might hold in his own country, has a &s;ingular claim to our attention and regard. John|&s;on indeed calls the report of Voltaire a wild and unau|thorized &s;tory; and Rolli a&s;&s;erts, in reply to it, that if Mil|ton &s;aw the Italian drama, it mu&s;t have been at Milan, as the Adamo, in his opinion, was a performance too con|temptible to be endured at Florence. "Andreini (&s;ays the critic of Italy) was a &s;troller (un i&s;trione) of the wor&s;t age of the Italian letters." Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e terms of contempt, which one of his countrymen has be&s;towed upon Andreini, he appears to me highly worthy of our no|tice; for (although in uniting, like Shake&s;peare and Mo|liere, the two different arts of writing and of acting plays, he di&s;covered not &s;uch extraordinary powers as have ju&s;tly immortalized tho&s;e idols of the theatre) he was yet endowed
<PB N="251" REF="273">
with one quality, not only uncommon, but &s;uch as might render him, if I may hazard the expre&s;&s;ion, the poetical parent of Milton. The quality I mean is, enthu&s;ia&s;m in the highe&s;t degree, not only poetical but religious. Even the preface that Andreini prefixed to his Adamo may be thought &s;ufficient to have acted like lightning on the inflammable ideas of the Engli&s;h poet, and to have kindled in his mind the blaze of cele&s;tial imagination.</P>
<P>I am aware, that in re&s;earches like the pre&s;ent, every conjecture may abound in illu&s;ion; the petty circum|&s;tances, by which great minds are led to the fir&s;t concep|tion of great de&s;igns, are &s;o various and volatile, that nothing can be more difficult to di&s;cover: fancy in par|ticular is of a nature &s;o airy, that the traces of her &s;tep are hardly to be di&s;cerned; ideas are &s;o fugitive, that if poets, in their life-time, were que&s;tioned concerning the manner in which the &s;eeds of con&s;iderable productions fir&s;t aro&s;e in their mind, they might not always be able to an&s;wer the enquiry; can it then be po&s;&s;ible to &s;ucceed in &s;uch an enquiry concerning a mighty genius, who has been con&s;igned more than a century to the tomb, e&s;peci|ally when, in the records of his life, we can find no po&s;itive evidence on the point in que&s;tion? However trifling the chances it may afford of &s;ucce&s;s, the inve&s;tigation in a&s;&s;uredly worthy our pur&s;uit; for, as an accompli&s;hed critic has &s;aid, in &s;peaking of another poet, with his u&s;ual felicity of di&s;cernment and expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>the enquiry cannot be void of entertainment whil&s;t Milton is our
<PB N="252" REF="274">
con&s;tant theme: whatever may be the fortune of the chace, we are &s;ure it will lead us through plea&s;ant pro|&s;pects and a fine country.</Q></P>
<P>It has been frequently remarked, that accident and genius generally con&s;pire in the origin of great perform|ances; and the accidents that give an impul&s;e to fancy are often &s;uch as are hardly within the reach of conjec|ture. Had Ellwood him&s;elf not recorded the occurrence, who would have &s;uppo&s;ed that a few words, which fell from a &s;imple youth in conver&s;ation, were the real &s;ource of Paradi&s;e Regained? Yet the offsprings of imagination, in this point of view, have a &s;triking analogy to the pro|ductions of nature. The noble poem ju&s;t mentioned re&s;embles a rare and valuable tree, not planted with care and foreca&s;t, but ari&s;ing vigorou&s;ly from a kernel dropt by a rambling bird on a &s;pot of peculiar fertility. We are perfectly a&s;&s;ured that Milton owed one of his great poems to the ingenuous que&s;tion of a young quaker; and Voltaire, as we have &s;een, has a&s;&s;erted, that he was indebted for the other to the fanta&s;tic drama of an Italian &s;troller. It does not appear that Vol|taire had any higher authority for his a&s;&s;ertion than his own conjecture from a &s;light in&s;pection of the drama, which he ha&s;tily de&s;cribes; yet it is mere ju&s;tice to this rapid entertaining writer to declare, that in his conjecture there is great probability, which the Engli&s;h reader, I believe, will be inclined to admit, in proportion as he becomes acquainted with Andreini and his Adamo;
<PB N="253" REF="275">
but before we examine their merit, and the degree of influence that we may &s;uppo&s;e them to have had on the fancy of Milton, let us contemplate, in one view, all the &s;cattered hints which the great poet has given us concern|ing the grand project of his life, his de&s;ign of writing an epic poem.</P>

For Adam now reigned in his fancy, not immediately as the &s;ubject of an epic poem, but as a capital per&s;onage in the plan of a dramatic compo&s;ition, that in&s;tead of being formed on the narrow ground of Grotius, in his Adamus Exul, allowed a wider range to the fancy, and included allegorical characters, like the Adamo of Andreini.</P>
<P>This compo&s;ition, fir&s;t printed at Milan, in 1613, and again in 1617, re&s;embles the my&s;teries of our early &s;tage; and is denominated in Italian, <HI>Rappre&s;entatione,</HI> a name which the writers of Italy apply to dramas founded on the &s;cripture.&mdash;Dr. Pearce has &s;aid, in the preface to his review of Milton's text, that he was informed an Italian tragedy exi&s;ted, entitled <HI>Il Paradi&s;o Per&s;o,</HI> Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; but, in a very exten&s;ive re&s;earch, I can di&s;cover no &s;uch performance. There is indeed another Italian drama on the &s;ubject, which I have not &s;een, entitled <HI>Adamo Caduto,</HI> tragedia &s;acra; but this was not printed until 1647, &s;ome years after the return of our poet from the con|tinent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>For the benefit of commentators on our divine bard, let me here in&s;ert a brief li&s;t of &s;uch Italian compo&s;itions, as my po&s;&s;ibly have afforded him &s;ome u&s;eful hints:</P><P N="1">1.

of Italian books, had brought the Adamo of An|dreini to England; and that the peru&s;al of an author, wild indeed, and abounding in grote&s;que extravagance, yet now and then &s;hining with pure and united rays of fancy and devotion, fir&s;t gave a new bias to the imagina|tion of the Engli&s;h poet, or, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ive phra&s;e of Voltaire, fir&s;t revealed to him the <HI>hidden maje&s;ty of the &s;ubject.</HI> The apo&s;tate angels of Andreini, though &s;ome|times hideou&s;ly and ab&s;urdly di&s;gu&s;ting, yet occa&s;ionally &s;parkle with &s;uch fire as might awaken the emulation of Milton.</P>

<P>After this minute account of Andreini's plan, the rea|der may be curious to &s;ee &s;ome &s;pecimens of his poetry in an Engli&s;h ver&s;ion. I &s;hall &s;elect three: Fir&s;t, the chorus of angels, which &s;erves as a prologue to the drama, and has been &s;o ludicrou&s;ly de&s;cribed by Voltaire; &s;econdly, the &s;oliloquy of Lucifer on his fir&s;t appearance; and,
<PB N="263" REF="285">
thirdly, the &s;cene in which Eve induces Adam to ta&s;te the fruit. I &s;hall prefix to them the preface of Andreini; but as the&s;e &s;pecimens of his compo&s;ition might &s;eem tedious here, and too much interrupt the cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay, I &s;hall detach them from it, and in&s;ert them as an Ap|pendix.</P>
<P>The maje&s;ty of Milton appears to the utmo&s;t advantage when he is fully compared with every writer, who&s;e poeti|cal powers have been exerci&s;ed on the &s;ubject, to which only his genius was equal.</P>
<P>Let me ob&s;erve, however, for the credit of Andreini, that although he has been contemptuou&s;ly called a &s;troller, he had &s;ome tincture of cla&s;&s;ical learning, and con&s;iderable piety. He occa&s;ionally imitates Virgil, and quotes the fathers. He was born in Florence, 1578; his mother was an actre&s;s, highly celebrated for the excellence of her talents, and the purity of her life; &s;he appeared al&s;o as an authore&s;s, and printed a volume of letters and e&s;&s;ays, to which two great poets of her country, Ta&s;&s;o and Marini, contributed each a &s;onnet. Her memory was celebrated by her &s;on, who publi&s;hed, at her death, a col|lection of poems in her prai&s;e. Having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a comedian at Milan, he travelled into France, in the train of the famous Mary de Medeci, and obtained, as an actor, the favour of Lewis the XIIIth. The bio|graphical work of Count Mazzuchelli on the writers of Italy, includes an account of Andreini, with a li&s;t of his various productions; they amount to the number of thirty,
<PB N="264" REF="286">
and form a &s;ingular medley of comedies and devout poems. His Adamo alone &s;eems likely to pre&s;erve his name from oblivion; and that indeed can never cea&s;e to be regarded as a literary curio&s;ity, while it is believed to have given a fortunate impul&s;e to the fancy of Milton.</P>
<P>If it is highly probable, as I think it will appear to every poetical reader, who peru&s;es the Adamo, that An|dreini turned the thoughts of Milton from Alfred to Adam, and led him to &s;ketch the fir&s;t outlines of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t in various plans of allegorical dramas, it is po&s;&s;ible that an Italian writer, le&s;s known than Andreini, fir&s;t threw into the mind of Milton the idea of converting Adam into an epic per&s;onage. I have now before me a literary curio&s;ity, which my accompli&s;hed friend, Mr. Walker, to whom the literature of Ireland has many obligations, very kindly &s;ent me, on his return from an excur&s;ion to Italy, where it happened to &s;trike a traveller, who&s;e mind is peculiarly awakened to elegant pur&s;uits. The book I am &s;peaking of is entitled La Scena Tragica d'Adamo ed Eva, E&s;tratta dalli primi tre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">api della Sacra Gene&s;i, e ridotta a &s;ignificato Morale da Troilo Lancetta, Bena|cen&s;e. Venetia 1644. This little work is dedicated to Maria Gonzaga, Dutche&s;s of Mant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, and is nothing more than a drama in pro&s;e, of the ancient form, entitled a morality, on the expul&s;ion of our fir&s;t parents from Paradi&s;e. The author does not mention Andreini, nor has he any mixture of ver&s;e in his compo&s;ition; but, in his addre&s;s to the reader, he has the following very re|markable
<PB N="265" REF="287">
pa&s;&s;age: after &s;ugge&s;ting that the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory of Adam and Eve is purely allegorical, and de&s;igned as an incentive to virtue, he &s;ays,</P>
<Q LANG="ita"><P>Una notte &s;ognai, che Moi&s;&egrave; mi por&s;e gratio&s;a e&s;po&s;itione, e mi&s;terio&s;o &s;ignifi|cato con parole tali apunto:</P>
<P>Dio f&agrave; parte all' huom di &s;e &s;te&s;&s;o con l' intervento della ragione, e di&s;pone con infallibile &s;entenza, che &s;ignoreggiando in lui la mede&s;ma &s;opra le &s;en&s;uali voglie, pre&s;ervato il pomo del proprio core dalli ap|petiti di&s;ordinati, per guiderdone di giu&s;ta obbedienza li trasforma il mondo in Paradi&s;o.&mdash; Di que&s;to s'io par|la&s;&s;i, al &s;icuro formarei heroico poema convenevole a &s;emidei.</P></Q>
<Q LANG="eng"><P>One night I dreamt that Mo&s;es explained to me the my&s;tery, almo&s;t in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>God reveals him&s;elf to man by the intervention of rea&s;on, and thus infallibly ordains that rea&s;on, while &s;he &s;upports her &s;overeignty over the &s;en&s;ual inclinations in man, and pre&s;erves the apple of his heart from licen|tious appetites, in reward of his ju&s;t obedience tran&s;|forms the world into Paradi&s;e.&mdash;Of this were I to &s;peak, a&s;&s;uredly I might form an heroic poem worthy of demi-gods.</P></Q>
<P>It &s;trikes me as po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e la&s;t words, a&s;&s;igned to Mo&s;es in his vi&s;ion by Troilo Lancetta, might operate on the mind of Milton like the que&s;tion of Ellwood, and prove, in his prolific fancy, a kind of rich graft on the
<PB N="266" REF="288">
idea he derived from Andreini, and the germ of his greate&s;t production.</P>
<P>A &s;ceptical critic, inclined to di&s;countenance this con|jecture, might indeed ob&s;erve, it is more probable that Milton never &s;aw a little volume not publi&s;hed until after his return from Italy, and written by an author &s;o ob|&s;cure, that his name does not occur in Tirabo&s;chi's ela|borate hi&s;tory of Italian literature; nor in the patient Ita|lian chronicler of poets, Quadrio, though he be&s;tows a chapter on early dramatic compo&s;itions in pro&s;e.&mdash;But the mind, that has once &s;tarted a conjecture of this nature, mu&s;t be weak indeed, if it cannot produce new &s;hadows of argument in aid of a favourite hypothe&s;is.&mdash;Let me therefore be allowed to advance, as a pre&s;umptive proof of Milton's having &s;een the work of Lancetta, that he makes <HI>a &s;imilar u&s;e of Mo&s;es,</HI> and introduces him to &s;peak a prologue in the &s;ketch of his various plans for an alle|gorical drama. It is indeed po&s;&s;ible that Milton might never &s;ee the performances either of Lancetta or Andreini &mdash;yet conjecture has ground enough to conclude very fairly, that he was acquainted with both; for Andreini wrote a long allegorical drama on Paradi&s;e, and we know that the fancy of Milton fir&s;t began to play with the &s;ub|ject according to that peculiar form of compo&s;ition.&mdash; Lancetta treated it al&s;o in the &s;hape of a dramatic alle|gory; but &s;aid, at the &s;ame time, under the character of Mo&s;es, that the &s;ubject might form an incomparable epic
<PB N="267" REF="289">
poem; and Milton, quitting his own ha&s;ty &s;ketches of allegorical dramas, accompli&s;hed a work which an&s;wers to that intimation.</P>
<P>After all, I allow that the province of conjecture is the region of &s;hadows; and as I offer my ideas on this topic rather as phantoms that may amu&s;e a lover of poetical &s;pe|culation, than as &s;olid proofs to determine a cau&s;e of great moment, I am per&s;uaded every good-natured reader will treat them with indulgence: a&s;&s;uredly I &s;hall feel neither anger, nor inclination to contend in their defence, if any &s;everer critic,
<Q>Irruat, &amp; fru&s;tra ferro diverberet umbras.</Q></P>
<P>In mentioning the imperfect rudiments of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, John&s;on &s;ays, very ju&s;tly, <Q>It is plea&s;ant to &s;ee great works in their &s;eminal &s;tate, pregnant with latent po&s;|&s;ibilities of excellence; nor could there be any more delightful entertainment than to trace their gradual growth and expan&s;ion, and to ob&s;erve how they are &s;ometimes &s;uddenly advanced by accidental hints, and &s;ometimes &s;lowly improved by &s;teady meditation.</Q> Such entertainment would indeed be peculiarly delightful in re&s;pect to Milton. It is in &s;ome mea&s;ure beyond our reach, becau&s;e, if we except his &s;ketches of plans for an allego|rical drama, no real evidence is left concerning the origin and progre&s;s of his magnificent conception: but &s;uppo&s;i|tion is often a plea&s;ant &s;ub&s;titute for ab&s;olute knowledge; and in the hope that it may prove &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e,
<PB N="268" REF="290">
let me advance in this &s;hadowy re&s;earch, and after ac|counting for the fir&s;t fla&s;hes of Milton's &s;ubject on his fancy, pur&s;ue the vein of conjecture, in con&s;idering various ideas that might influence him in the pro&s;ecution of his work.</P>
<P>When Adam engaged the fancy of Milton, however that per&s;onage might fir&s;t be impre&s;&s;ed upon it as a &s;ub|ject of ver&s;e, many circum&s;tances might con&s;pire to con|firm his a&s;cendency. The work of different arts, which the poet &s;urveyed in his travels, had, perhaps, a con&s;ider|able influence in attaching his imagination to our fir&s;t parents.&mdash;He had mo&s;t probably contemplated them not only in the colours of Michael Angelo, who decorated Rome with his picture of the creation, but in the marble of Bandinelli, who had executed two large &s;tatues of Adam and Eve, which, though they were far from &s;atisfying the ta&s;te of connoi&s;&s;eurs, might &s;timulate even by their im|perfections the genius of a poet. In recollecting how painting and &s;culpture had both exerci&s;ed their re&s;pective powers on the&s;e hallowed and intere&s;ting characters, the mu&s;e of Milton might be tempted to contend with the &s;i&s;ter arts. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, that Richard&s;on, a fond idolater of the&s;e arts and of Milton, is rather in|clined to believe that they did not much occupy the attention of the poet, even during his re&s;idence in Italy: yet I am per&s;uaded he mu&s;t have been greatly &s;truck by the works of Michael Angelo, a genius whom he re|&s;embled &s;o much in his grand characteri&s;tic, mental mag|nificence!
<PB N="269" REF="291">
and to whom he was infinitely &s;uperior in the attractive excellencies of delicacy and grace. In touch|ing on a point of re&s;emblance between the poet and this pre-eminent arti&s;t, we cannot fail to ob&s;erve the abun|dance and variety of charms in the poetry of Milton. All the different perfections, which are a&s;&s;igned as cha|racteri&s;tics to the mo&s;t celebrated painters, are united in this marvellous poet. He has the &s;ublime grandeur of Michael Angelo, the cha&s;te &s;implicity of Raphael, the &s;weetne&s;s of Correggio, and the richne&s;s of Rubens. In his Samp&s;on we may admire the force of Rembrandt, and in his Comus the grace and gaiety of Albano and Pou&s;&s;in: in &s;hort, there is no charm exhibited by painting, which his poetry has failed to equal, as far as analogy between the different arts can extend. If Milton did not pay much attention in his travels to tho&s;e works of the great painters that he had opportunities of &s;urveying (which I cannot think probable) it is certain that his own works afford a mo&s;t excellent field to exerci&s;e and animate the powers of the pencil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned, ingenious, enthu&s;ia&s;tic Winckelman has advanced, in his mo&s;t cele|brated work, a very different opinion; but the ardour with which this extraordinary man had &s;tudied and idolized the antients, render|ed him deplorably pre&s;umptuous and precipi|tate in &s;everal of his ideas relating to modern genius, and particularly in what he has a&s;&s;ert|ed of Milton. Some pa&s;&s;ionate admirers of antiquity &s;eem to lament the fall of pagani&s;m, as fatal to poetry, to painting, and to &s;culpture; but a more liberal and enlightened &s;pirit of critici&s;m may rather believe, what it is very po&s;&s;ible, I apprehend, to demon&s;trate, that chri&s;tianity can hardly be more favourable to the purity of morals, than it might be rendered to the perfection of the&s;e delightful arts. Mil|ton him&s;elf may be regarded is an obvious and complete proof that the po&s;ition is true as far as poetry is concerned. In what degrees the influence of the Chri&s;tian religion can affect the other two, it may be plea&s;ing, and perhaps u&s;eful, to con&s;ider in &s;ome future compo&s;ition devoted to their advancement.</NOTE>. The article in which I apprehend
<PB N="270" REF="292">
a painter mu&s;t find it mo&s;t difficult to equal the felicity of the poet is, the delineation of his apo&s;tate angels. Here, perhaps, poetry has &s;ome important advantage over her &s;i&s;ter art; and even poetry her&s;elf is con&s;idered by au&s;terer critics as unequal to the ta&s;k. John&s;on regarded the book of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, which de&s;cribes the war of Heaven, as fit to be "the favourite of children."&mdash;Imagi|nation it&s;elf may be depreciated, by the au&s;terity of logic, as a childi&s;h faculty, but tho&s;e who love even its exce&s;&s;es may be allowed to exult in its delights. No reader truly poetical ever peru&s;ed the &s;ixth book of Milton without enjoying a kind of tran&s;port, which a &s;tern logician might indeed condemn, but which he might al&s;o think it more de&s;irable to &s;hare. I doubt not but while Milton was revolving his &s;ubject in his mind, he often heard from critical acquaintance &s;uch remarks as might have induced him, had his imagination been le&s;s energetic, to relinqui&s;h the angels as intractable beings, ill &s;uited to the &s;phere of poetry. But if his glowing &s;pirit was ever damped for a moment by &s;ugge&s;tions of this nature, he was probably re-animated and encouraged by recollecting his re&s;pect|able old acquaintance, the poets of Italy. He had not only &s;een the infernal powers occa&s;ionally delineated with great maje&s;ty and effect in the Jeru&s;alem of Ta&s;&s;o, and Marini's "Slaughter of the Innocents," but he was pro|bably acquainted with an Italian poem, little known in England, and formed expre&s;sly on the conflict of the apo&s;tate &s;pirits. The work I allude to is, the Angeleida
<PB N="271" REF="293">
of Era&s;mo Valva&s;one, printed at Venice, in 1590. This poet was of a noble family in the Venetian republic; as his health was delicate, he devoted him&s;elf to retired &s;tudy, and cultivated the Mu&s;es in his ca&s;tle of Valva&s;one. His works are various, and one of his early compo&s;itions was honoured by the applau&s;e of Ta&s;&s;o. His Angeleida con&s;i&s;ts of three cantos on the War of Heaven, and is &s;ingularly terminated by a &s;onnet, addre&s;&s;ed to the trium|phant Archangel Michael. Several pa&s;&s;ages in Valva&s;one induce me to think that Milton was familiar with his work.&mdash;I will only tran&s;cribe the ver&s;es, in which the Italian poet a&s;&s;igns to the infernal powers the invention of artillery:

<P>Valva&s;one acknowledges, in his preface, that he had been cen&s;ured for having <HI>&s;poken &s;o materially</HI> (ragionato co&s;i ma|terialmente) of angels, who are only &s;pirit. But he de|fends him&s;elf very ably on this point, and mentions with gratitude two excellent critical di&s;cour&s;es, written in his vindication by Giovanni Ralli and Ottavio Menini;&mdash;there is a third al&s;o, according to Quadrio, by Scipione di Man|zano, under the name of Olimpo Marcucci, printed at Venice, in 4to, 1594. They all be&s;tow great prai&s;e on the author whom they vindicate, who appears to have been a very amiable man, and a poet of con&s;iderable powers, though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the &s;ublimity and the refinement of Milton or Ta&s;&s;o. In his general ideas of poetry he re|&s;embled them both; and in his mode of expre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf, in the preface to his Angeleida, he reminds me very &s;trongly of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the pro&s;e works of Milton, where he &s;peaks on the hallowed magnificence of the art. They both con&s;idered &s;acred &s;ubjects as peculiarly proper for ver&s;e; an idea condemned by John&s;on, who &s;ympathi&s;ed as little with Milton in his poetic as in his political prin|ciples. It was by entertaining ideas of poetry, directly contrary to tho&s;e of his critic, that Milton rendered him|&s;elf,
<PB N="273" REF="295">
in true dignity, the fir&s;t poet of the world. Nor can we think that dignity in any degree impaired, by di&s;|covering that many hints might be &s;ugge&s;ted to him by various poets, in different languages, who had &s;eized either a part or the whole of his &s;ubject before him. On the con|trary, the more of the&s;e we can di&s;cover, and the more we compare them with the Engli&s;h bard, the more rea&s;on we &s;hall find to exult in the pre-eminence of his poetical powers. Ta&s;&s;o, in his critical di&s;cour&s;es, inculcates a very ju&s;t maxim concerning the originality of epic poets, which is very applicable to Milton.&mdash;<Q>Nuovo &s;ar&agrave; il poema, in cui nuova &s;ara la te&s;tura de' nodi, nuove le &s;olutioni, nuovi gli epi&s;odi, che per entro vi &s;ono trapo&s;ti, quan|tunque la materia fo&s;&s;e noti&s;&s;ima, e dagli altri prima trat|tata: perche la novita del poema &s;i con&s;idera piutto&s;to alla forma, che alla materia.</Q></P>
<P>This great writer illu&s;trates his po&s;ition, that the no|velty of a poem is to be e&s;timated more from its form than its &s;ubject, by the example of Alamanni, an epic poet of Italy, who lo&s;t the prai&s;e he might otherwi&s;e have acquired, by copying too fondly, under modern names, the incidents of Homer. &mdash;Milton is of all authors un|doubtedly one of the mo&s;t original, both in thought and expre&s;&s;ion: the language of his greater works is evidently borrowed from no model, but it &s;eems to have great con|formity with the precepts which Ta&s;&s;o has delivered in the di&s;cour&s;es I have ju&s;t cited, for the formation of
<PB N="274" REF="296">
an epic &s;tyle. Yet in critici&s;m, as in politics, Milton was undoubtedly
<Q>Nullius addictus jurare in verba magi&s;tri.</Q>
He thought on every topic for him&s;elf; ju&s;tly remark|ing, that <Q>to neglect rules and follow nature, in them that know art and u&s;e judgment, is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but an enriching of art.</Q> This excellent maxim in&s;ured to him the exerci&s;e and the independence of his own elevated mind. There is frequent allu&s;ion to the works of anti|quity in Milton, yet no poet, perhaps, who revered the ancients with &s;uch affectionate enthu&s;ia&s;m, has copied them &s;o little. This was partly owing to the creative opulence of his own genius, and partly to his having fixed on a &s;ubject &s;o different from tho&s;e of Homer and Virgil, that he may be &s;aid to have accompli&s;hed a revolution in poetry, and to have purified and extended the empire of the epic mu&s;e. One of the chief motives that induced his imagination to de&s;ert its early favourite Arthur, and attach it&s;elf to our fir&s;t parents, is partly explained in tho&s;e admirable ver&s;es of the ninth book, where the poet mentions the choice of his own &s;ubject, contra&s;ted with tho&s;e of his illu&s;trious predece&s;&s;ors:

<P>Milton &s;eems to have given a purer &s;ignification than we commonly give to the word hero, and to have thought
<PB N="276" REF="298">
it might be a&s;&s;igned to any per&s;on eminent and attractive enough to form a principal figure in a great picture. In truth, when we recollect the etymology which a philo&s;o|pher and a &s;aint have left us of the term, we cannot ad|mire the propriety of devoting it to illu&s;trious homicides. Plato derives the Greek word from others, that imply either eloquence or love; and St. Augu&s;tine, from the Grecian name of Juno, or the air, becau&s;e original he|roes were pure departed &s;pirits, &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide in that element. In Milton's idea, the ancient heroes of epic poetry &s;eem to have too much re&s;embled the modern great man, according to the delineation of that charac|ter in Fielding's exqui&s;ite hi&s;tory of Jonathan Wild the Great. Much as the Engli&s;h poet delighted in the poetry of Homer, he appears to have thought, like an American writer of the pre&s;ent age, who&s;e fervent pa&s;&s;ion for the Mu&s;es is only inferior to his philanthropy, that the Grecian bard, though celebrated as the prince of morali&s;ts by Horace, and e&s;teemed a teacher of virtue by St. Ba&s;il, has too great a tendency to nouri&s;h that &s;anguinary madne&s;s in mankind, which has continually made the earth a theatre of carnage. I am afraid that &s;ome poets and hi&s;torians may have been a little acce&s;&s;ary to the innumerable ma&s;|&s;acres with which men, ambitious of obtaining the title of hero, have de&s;olated the world; and it is certain, that a &s;evere judge of Homer may, with &s;ome plau&s;ibility, apply to him the reproach that his Agamemnon utters to Achilles:
<Q><PB N="277" REF="299">
<GAP DESC="foreign"></Q>
<Q>For all thy plea&s;ure is in &s;trife and blood.</Q>
Yet a lover of the Grecian bard may ob&s;erve, in his defence, that in a&s;&s;igning the&s;e words to the leader of his ho&s;t, he &s;hews the pacific propriety of his own &s;entiments; and that, however his ver&s;es may have in&s;tigated an Alexander to carnage, or prompted the calamitous fre|quency of war, even this pagan poet, &s;o famous as the de&s;criber of battles, dete&s;ted the objects of his de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>But whatever may be thought of the heathen bard, Milton, to whom a purer religion had given greater pu|rity, and I think greater force of imagination, Milton, from a long &s;urvey of human nature, had contracted &s;uch an abhorrence for the atrocious ab&s;urdity of ordinary war, that his feelings in this point &s;eem to have in|fluenced his epic fancy. He appears to have relinqui&s;h|ed common heroes, that he might not cheri&s;h the too common characteri&s;tic of man&mdash;a &s;anguinary &s;pirit. He a&s;pired to delight the imagination, like Homer, and to produce, at the &s;ame time, a much happier effect on the mind. Has he &s;ucceeded in this glorious idea? A&s;&s;uredly he has:&mdash;to plea&s;e is the end of poetry. Homer plea&s;es perhaps more univer&s;ally than Milton; but the plea&s;ure that the Engli&s;h poet excites, is more exqui&s;ite in its nature, and &s;uperior in its effect. An eminent
<PB N="278" REF="300">
painter of France u&s;ed to &s;ay, that in reading Homer he felt his nerves dilated, and he &s;eemed to increa&s;e in &s;tature. Such an ideal effect as Homer, in this exam|ple, produced on the body, Milton produces in the &s;pi|rit. To a reader who thoroughly reli&s;hes the two poems on Paradi&s;e, his heart appears to be purified, in propor|tion to the plea&s;ure he derives from the poet, and his mind to become angelic. Such a ta&s;te for Milton is rare, and the rea&s;on why it is &s;o is this:&mdash;To form it complete|ly, a reader mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, in &s;ome degree, what was &s;uper|latively po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the poet, a mixture of two different &s;pecies of enthu&s;ia&s;m, the poetical and the religious. To reli&s;h Homer, it is &s;ufficient to have a pa&s;&s;ion for excellent ver&s;e; but the reader of Milton, who is only a lover of the Mu&s;es, lo&s;es half, and certainly the be&s;t half, of that tran&s;cendent delight which the poems of this divine en|thu&s;ia&s;t are capable of imparting. A devotional ta&s;te is as requi&s;ite for the full enjoyment of Milton as a ta&s;te for poetry; and this remark will &s;ufficiently explain the in|con&s;i&s;tency &s;o &s;triking in the &s;entiments of many di&s;tin|gui&s;hed writers, who have repeatedly &s;poken on the great Engli&s;h poet&mdash;particularly that incon&s;i&s;tency, which I partly promi&s;ed to explain in the judgments of Dryden and Voltaire. The&s;e very different men had both a pa&s;&s;ion for ver&s;e, and both &s;trongly felt the poetical powers of Milton: but Dryden perhaps had not much, and Voltaire had certainly not a particle, of Milton's religious enthu|&s;ia&s;m;

hence, in&s;tead of being impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;anctity of his &s;ubject, they &s;ometimes glanced upon it in a ludi|crous point of view.</P>
<P>Hence they &s;ometimes &s;peak of him as the very prince of poets, and &s;ometimes as a mi&s;guided genius, who has failed to obtain the rank he a&s;pired to in the poetical world. But neither the caprices of conceit, nor the cold au&s;terity of rea&s;on, can reduce the glory of this pre-emi|nent bard.&mdash;It was in an hour propitious to his renown, that he relinqui&s;hed Arthur and Merlin for Adam and the Angels; and he might &s;ay on the occa&s;ion, in the words of his admired Petrarch:
<Q LANG="ita"><LG>
<L>Io benedico il luogo, il tempo, e l' hora</L>
<L>Che &s;i alto miraro gli occhi m&iuml;ei.</L>

<L>When my pre&s;umptuous eyes were fix'd &s;o high.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>To &s;ay that his poem wants human intere&s;t, is only to prove, that he who finds that defect wants the proper &s;en|&s;ibility of man. A work that di&s;plays at full length, and in the &s;tronge&s;t light, the delicious tranquillity of inno|cence, the tormenting turbulence of guilt, and the con|&s;olatory &s;atisfaction of repentance, has &s;urely abundance of attraction to awaken &s;ympathy. The images and &s;en|timents that belong to the&s;e varying &s;ituations are &s;o &s;uited to our mortal exi&s;tence, that they cannot cea&s;e to intere&s;t, while human nature endures. The human heart,
<PB N="280" REF="302">
indeed, may be too much depraved, and the human mind may be too licentious, or too gloomy, to have a perfect reli&s;h for Milton; but, in honour of his poetry, we may ob&s;erve, that it has a peculiar tendency to delight and to meliorate tho&s;e characters, in which the &s;eeds of ta&s;te and piety have been happily &s;own by nature. In proportion as the admiration of mankind &s;hall grow more and more valuable from the progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of intelligence, of virtue, and of religion, this incomparable poet will be more affectionately &s;tudied, and more univer&s;ally admired.</P>

&s;pears, trumpets, drums, trophies, banners, li&s;ts, hammers, torches, bellows, funeral piles, theatres, exchequers, in|finite things of a like nature, introduced by the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;in; they ought not to pa&s;s through the mind, or through the lips of Adam, although he had knowledge infu&s;ed into him, as one who lived mo&s;t happy in a &s;tate of innocence; deprived, moreover, of introducing points of hi&s;tory, &s;acred or profane, of relating fictions of fabulous deities, of rehear|&s;ing loves, furies, arms, &s;ports of hunting or fi&s;hing, tri|umphs, &s;hipwrecks, conflagrations, inchantments, and things of a like nature, that are in truth the ornament and the &s;oul of poetry; difficult from not knowing in what &s;tile Adam ought to &s;peak, &s;ince, in re&s;pect to his knowledge, it might be proper to a&s;&s;ign to him ver&s;es of a high, maje&s;tic, and flow|ing &s;tile; but con&s;idering him as a &s;hepherd, and an inhabi|tant of the woods, it appears that he &s;hould be &s;imple and &s;weet in his di&s;cour&s;e, and I endeavoured, on that account, to render it &s;uch, as much as I could, by variety of ver&s;ification; and here, taking courage in my greate&s;t doubt, I formed, I know not how, a beginning; I advanced, if I may &s;ay &s;o, without any determinate plan, and arrived at the end before I was aware. Whence I am inclined to believe, that the &s;avour of God, regarding rather my good intentions than my defects (for as he often withdraws the heart of man from evil, &s;o he conducts it in&s;en&s;ibly to good) gave direction to my hand, and completed my work. Wherefore to that alone I am indebted for the little grace that may perhaps be found in the pre&s;ent labour; knowing that as omnipotence is accu&s;tomed to pro|duce wonders from the rude and unformed chaos, &s;o from the &s;till ruder chaos of my mind it may have called forth

this production, if not for any other purpo&s;e, yet to be &s;acred, and to make, as it were, a mute &s;peak in my per&s;on, in de&s;pight of poverty of genius, as on the other hand it is accu&s;tomed to &s;trike mute the mo&s;t eloquent tongues, when they employ them&s;elves on &s;ubjects low and profane. Let it be &s;urveyed, therefore, with an eye of indulgence, and blame not the poverty of &s;tile, the want of dignity in the conduct of the circum&s;tances, &s;terility of conceits, weakne&s;s of &s;pirit, in&s;ipid plea&s;antries, and extravagant epi&s;odes; to mention, without &s;peaking of an infinitude of other things, that the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil, pre&s;ent them&s;elves in human &s;hapes to tempt Adam, &s;ince there was then in the univer&s;e no other man or woman, and the &s;erpent di&s;co|vered him&s;elf to Eve with a human &s;imilitude; moreover, this is done that the &s;ubject may be better comprehended by the under&s;tanding, through the medium of the &s;en&s;es; &s;ince the great temptations that Adam and Eve at once &s;u&s;|tained, were indeed in the interior of their own mind, but could not be &s;o comprehended by the &s;pectator; nor is it to be believed that the &s;erpent held a long di&s;pute with Eve, &s;ince he tempted her rather by a &s;ugge&s;tion to her mind, than by conference, &s;aying the&s;e words, "Nequaquam moriemini, et eritis &s;icut Dii, &s;cientes bonum et malum;" and yet it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to expre&s;s tho&s;e internal contentions, to find &s;ome expedient to give them an outward repre&s;enta|tion; but if it is permitted to the painter, who is a dumb poet, to expre&s;s by colours God the Father, under the per&s;on of a man &s;ilvered by age; to de&s;cribe, under the image of a white dove, the purity of the &s;pirit; and to figure the di|vine me&s;&s;engers, or angels, under the &s;hape of winged youths,
<PB N="291" REF="313">
why is it not permitted to the poet, who is a &s;peaking painter, to repre&s;ent, in his theatrical production, another man and another woman be&s;ides Adam and Eve, and to repre&s;ent their internal conflicts through the medium of images and voices entirely human, not to mention that it appears more allowable to introduce in this work the devil under a human &s;hape, than it is to introduce into it the eternal Father and an angel; and if this is permitted, and &s;een every day exhi|bited in &s;acred repre&s;entations, why &s;hould it not be allowed in the pre&s;ent, where, if the greater evil is allowable, &s;urely the le&s;s &s;hould be allowed: attend therefore, gentle reader, more to the &s;ub&s;tance than to the accident, con&s;idering in the work the great end of introducing into the theatre of the &s;oul the mi&s;ery and lamentation of Adam, to make your heart a &s;pectator of them, in order to rai&s;e it from the&s;e dregs of earth to the magnificence of heaven, through the medium of virtue and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, by whom may you be ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
