<HEAD>A NEW TEST OF THE Church of <HI>ENGLAND</HI>'s Loyalty.</HEAD>
<P>IN all the unhappy Contentions among Parties and Factions in this brangling Nation, the Champions of the Church of <HI>England, as they would have them|&s;elves call'd,</HI> have laid it down as the di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of their Hiearchy, that it is her Practice, and has been deriv'd from her very Con&s;titution, as well as Doctrine, to &s;ix in all her Members Prin|ciples of un&s;haken Loyalty to her Prince, entire and undi&s;|puted Obedience to all her Commands, and an Abhorrence of the very Thoughts of tho&s;e Helli&s;h Principles, <HI>That it can be lawful on any Account what&s;oever to re&s;i&s;t the E&s;tablish'd Power of their Kings&punc;</HI></P>
<P>'T wou'd be endle&s;s to quote the Reverend Dr. <HI>B&mdash;ge,</HI> who from the Text in the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  <HI>Re&s;i&s;t not the Powers,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for what&s;oever Powers are, be ordain'd of God; who&s;oever there|fore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God;</HI> tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That if the King &s;hou'd by his Royal Command execute the greate&s;t Violence upon either our Pen&s;on or E&s;tate, our Du|ty was to &s;ubmit by Prayers and Tears fir&s;t to God Almigh|ty, to turn the Wrath of His Vicegerent from His Servant,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
and by humble Entreaty to beg his Maje&s;ties Grace and Par|don; but <HI>to lift up the Hand again&s;t the Lord's Anointed, or re&s;i&s;t the Evil of Punishment he thought &s;it to inflict,</HI> this were a Crime unpardonable, either before God or Man, and a Crime, (&s;ays the Reverend Doctor) which we ble&s;s God the very Principles of our <HI>Ever Loyal Mother,</HI> the Church of <HI>England,</HI> abhors and dete&s;ts.<P>'Let Incendiaries, Phanaticks, and Bloody Peace-break|ing Whigs (&s;ays another Learned Divine) nouri&s;h the Vi|p'rous Principles of Trea&s;on and Rebellion, and let them meet the due Reward of their Factious Doings in the Re|&s;entments of a Righteous, but Provok'd Nation: But God be prai&s;ed, our Mother the Church of <HI>England</HI> has always brought up her Sons in an un&s;potted Loyalty and Obedi|ence; none have been found lifting up their Hands again&s;t their Sovereign, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Rights of the Anointed of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>'The very Being and Life, the Original and Principles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> (&s;ays another 30th of <HI>January</HI> Ser|mon) is Loyalty and Fidelity to God as the immediate Su|pream, and to the King as the lively Image of Divine Au|thority, who&s;e Power is immediately deriv'd from, holds of, and is accountable to none but to God him&s;elf.</P></Q></P>
<P>To avoid Prolixity of Quotation, the Reader is de&s;ir'd to accept of the&s;e as &s;ufficient Proofs of what I lay down <HI>upon this Condition; neverthele&s;s,</HI> that be&s;ides the general Appeal which I might make to the Memory of mo&s;t Men, I oblige my &s;elf upon Demand to produce Ten Thou&s;and fair Quo|tations out of the Writings of our late modern Authors &s;ince the Re&s;tauration; wherein the Doctrines of Non-re&s;i&s;tance of Princes, Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, and the Divine Authority of the Kingly power, is own'd and declar'd to be an E&s;&s;ential part of the Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and upon this Foot, which I hold to be &s;ufficient, I think I cannot be cen&s;ured if I take it for granted.</P>
<P>Now, as this too much divided Nation has always been compos'd of two contending Parties, tho&s;e Parties have been
<PB N="3" REF="4">
di&s;tingui&s;h'd, <HI>as in like Ca&s;es,</HI> by Names of Contempt; and tho' they have often chang'd them on either &s;ide, as Cava|lier and Roundhead, Royali&s;ts and Rebels, Malignants and Phanaticks, Tories and Whigs, yet the Divi&s;ion has always been barely <HI>the Church and the Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> and there it continues to this Day.</P>
<P>As the Church of <HI>England</HI> Party have boa&s;ted of their own Loyalty, &s;o they have branded the Di&s;&s;enter with Rebellion and Faction, not only in their Nature, but in their very Principles; they have laid it down in their Writings and Sermons, and multitudes of their ignorant Hearers believe it, that <HI>the very Doctrine of the Di&s;&s;enter is made up of Principles in their own Nature, tending to Confu&s;ion and Rebellion;</HI> they wont be content that we &s;hould own there may be Men among all Parties of bad De&s;igns, and who wou'd on all Occa&s;ions em|broil their Native Country, but it mu&s;t be woven with the very Articles of Faith, and that 'tis the Religion of a Di&s;&s;enter to di&s;turb Government, kill Kings, and oppo&s;e Laws.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The Phanatical Enemies of our King and Church (&s;ays the Learned Dr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>) drink in Rebellion as Water; 'tis the very Sub&s;tance of their Schi&s;matical Doctrine to over|whelm and de&s;troy; and Common-wealths and Confu&s;ions are the Doctrines they preach.</Q></P>
<P>He that lays out one Groat with a Di&s;&s;enter (&s;ays the wor|thy Sir <HI>Roger</HI> in one of his famous <HI>Ob&s;ervators</HI>) contributes ju&s;t &s;o much as the Profits of that Groat amounts to in Trade towards the Subver&s;ion of the Monarchy, and erecting a Common-wealth; for the very Nature and Tendency of their Profe&s;&s;ion is de&s;tructive of Kingly power, and the Govern|ment of the Nation.</P>
<P>This has been the Opinion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both of them&s;elves on one Hand, and of the Di&s;&s;enters on the o|ther Hand. I &s;hould be glad if I cou'd only &s;ay, <HI>It has been,</HI> for we find 'tis &s;till too much their Opinion.</P>
<P>Let no Man &s;ay that the Author of the&s;e Sheets is either widening or keeping unheal'd the Breaches of this Nation; for if I can make it appear that there is really no occa&s;ion of &s;uch
<PB N="4" REF="5">
unnatural Divi&s;ions; and that neither the extraordinary O|pinion of them&s;elves, nor the Contempt of their Neighbours, as to the matter of Loyalty, is a becoming Principle; no, nor a rational one neither: For that as to Loyalty, Pa&s;&s;ive O|bedience, Non-re&s;i&s;tance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is really no great Diffe|rence between one &s;ide or other. I go as far towards healing the Breach as any Man; for there can be no better way to end the Strife on both &s;ides, than to prove that neither &s;ide has any ju&s;t cau&s;e to contend.</P>
<P>To examine the Matter on both &s;ides, &s;eems very u&s;eful at this time, in order to reconcile Parties, and to &s;ettle the Univer&s;al Character of the Nation.</P>
<P>The Government of <HI>England</HI> is a limited Monarchy, com|po&s;ed of King, Lords and Commons. Each have their &s;e|veral, their &s;eparate, and conjunctive Powers; which act|ing in concert, make the Harmony of the Con&s;titution. I &s;hall not invade the Province of tho&s;e Learned Gentlemen, who have undertaken to &s;et forth the Branches of the Con|&s;titution in all their Powers, Limitations and Prerogatives: 'Tis enough to &s;ay the Con&s;titution is known, the Govern|ment is confin'd by Laws, the Crown limited by Statutes, and the People's Right confirm'd by conce&s;&s;ion of Ages.</P>
<P>To this Government, all Di&s;tinction of Names &s;et apart, I am of the Opinion, all Parties have in their Turns been e|qually Loyal: I was going to &s;ay, equally Di&s;loyal: And if I were to u&s;e the Language of late Times, it wou'd be a very proper way of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Affirming without demon&s;trating is an ab&s;urd way of Ar|guing, and therefore it will be needful to come to particulars, and to examine the &s;everal Acts and Deeds of both Parties when the Kingly Prerogative has &s;hock'd or cla&s;h'd with the People.</P>
<P>In order to this 'tis needful to examine the Date of the Difference, and &s;o to enter a little into Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t Reformation from Popery was in the Days of King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. I call it the fir&s;t, becau&s;e 'twas under him that the whole Nation and the Government embrac'd the Prote&s;tant Reform'd Religion&punc; this Prote&s;tant Religi|on
<PB N="5" REF="6">
was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by that <HI>Zealous KING,</HI> and by his Parlia|ment, back'd with the force of Laws, and confirm'd by all the Sanction of Authority it was capable of, and here it be|gan to be call'd the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Some enquiring Chri&s;tians were for making farther Steps, and carrying on the Reformation to a higher Degree; and if that good reforming King had liv'd, his Zeal and Integrity was &s;uch, that there was no doubt he would have gone on to perfect every Thing he had begun, as new Light or more Knowledge had encrea&s;ed; but the return of Popery under Queen <HI>Mary</HI> put a Stop to the Work in general, and went very far towards overturning the whole Structure of the Reformation.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> re&s;tor'd it again; but as &s;he was a zealous Prote&s;tant Queen, yet &s;he was not for &s;ubjecting the Refor|mation to any amendment. Not that &s;he believ'd it perfect; but &s;he was a Politick Prince&s;s, &s;urrounded with Enemies that were not to be dally'd with, and &s;he was loth to &s;up|po&s;e &s;uch Defects in the Reformation as were alledg'd, be|cau&s;e 'twas to le&s;&s;en the Reputation of it, and con&s;equently her Intere&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;ted upon the further Reformation were then call'd <HI>Puritans,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;et up for greater Purity of Wor&s;hip, and they &s;eparated them&s;elves from the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Church, becau&s;e, as they &s;aid, their Con&s;ciences in|form'd them that they could &s;erve God more agreeable to his Will.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not meddle with the Arguments made u&s;e of on both Sides, either to defend or expo&s;e this Principle; 'tis &s;uffici|ent to acquaint my Reader that this is the true Original of the Di&s;&s;enters: We are now to examine a little further back. Before this Reformation there was no &s;uch thing as Church of <HI>England;</HI> it was then the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> that was the e|&s;tabli&s;h'd National Church.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants under the Titles of <HI>Lollards, Wickliffians, Hu&s;&s;ites,</HI> &amp;c. what did they do? Did they, <HI>as our Modern People &s;ay every Body &s;hou'd,</HI> confirm to what the Government
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Commanded? No, the pre&s;ent Church of <HI>England</HI> Party were the Di&s;&s;enters, the Schi&s;maticks and Phanaticks, in the Days of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. were per&s;ecuted for not coming to Church; many of them put to Death, and always treated with Scorn and Contempt, as Enemies to the Government, Broachers of new Opinions, and Contemners of Authority; as in the ca&s;e of that famous Proto-Martyr of Chri&s;t's Church, <HI>John Lambert,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>In the next Ages the&s;e come to have the Power in their Hands, and forgetting that they had found it <HI>righteous in the Sight of God to obey God rather than Man,</HI> they treat tho&s;e who&s;e Con&s;ciences oblige them to di&s;&s;ent from them, with the &s;ame Contempt which them&s;elves had receiv'd from the <HI>Roman</HI> Government.</P>
<P>Thus far they are upon even Terms, as to Obedience to their Superiors.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters have the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion after this to &s;how their Submi&s;&s;ion under extraordinary Pre&s;&s;ures. Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI> di&s;countenanc'd them continually; and as good a Queen as &s;he was, put &s;ome of them to Death. King <HI>James</HI> I. hun|ted them quite out of the Kingdom, made Thou&s;ands of them fly into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and at la&s;t to <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>During the long Reign of the&s;e two Princes, we find no Charge of Trea&s;on or Rebellion upon them; they bore the Di&s;plea&s;ure of their Princes with Patience and Pa&s;&s;ive Obe|dience; <HI>if I may be allow'd that Ridiculous Phra&s;e;</HI> being per|&s;ecuted in one City, they fled to another; they bore illegal Pro&s;ecutions, and things contrary to their Right, as <HI>English</HI> Men, but never took up Arms again&s;t their Prince.</P>
<P>Under the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Ca&s;e alter'd, the King and Parliament fell out about Matters of Civil Right, and Inva&s;ion of the Liberty and Properties of the People, the <HI>Puritans</HI> or Di&s;&s;enters, call them what we plea&s;e, fell in unanimou&s;ly with the Parliament.</P>
<P>And here 'tis worthy Remark, that the fir&s;t Difference be|tween the King and the <HI>English</HI> Parliament did not re&s;pect Religion, but Civil Property; nor were the Majority of the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Hou&s;e of <HI>Puritans,</HI> but true Church Prote&s;tants, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men; who &s;tood upon the Rights of the People, as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men; and none were more Zealous in the fir&s;t Di&s;putes than the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Wentworth,</HI> and &s;uch as were after|wards deep Sufferers for the King.</P>
<P>But the Parliament finding the Puritan Party &s;tuck clo&s;e to their Cau&s;e, they al&s;o came over to them when things came to a Rupture, and &s;o the War begun on the Score of Right, Inva&s;ion of Liberty, Breach of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Laws, Private Leagues, and Male Admini&s;tration; a Game we have &s;een play'd over again by the very &s;ame Church of <HI>England</HI> that have exclaim'd &s;o much again&s;t it, &s;o damn'd it, and &s;o damn'd them&s;elves, by Oaths, Declarations, Te&s;ts, and God knows what, again&s;t it.</P>
<P>'Tis allow'd here the Puritan broke thro' his Loyalty, and his former Obedience, and fought his Way to the Liberty he demanded. Well, the War ended to his Advantage, he &s;ubdued his Sovereign, and brought him to the Block, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of the whole World.</P>
<P>I wont di&s;pute here which or which Party did or did not do it, but to give the Enemy all ju&s;t Advantage, I am wil|ling to grant it in the large&s;t Sen&s;e that the Di&s;&s;enters, or Phanaticks, or Whigs, call them as you plea&s;e, did embrue their Hands in the Blood of the Lord's Anointed, put to Death that ble&s;&s;ed Martyr, King <HI>Charles</HI> the I. whom a learned Divine, in a Sermon on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> before the Parliament, compares both in the manner of his Suffe|rings, and the People by whom, to our Saviour and the Jews, and boldly runs on in the Bla&s;phemous Parallel, to &s;hew that the Indignities and Sufferings of King <HI>Charles</HI> exceed tho&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I think I have granted as largely as a fair Adver&s;ary can de&s;ire; for I have yielded for Peace-&s;ake to &s;everal things which I cou'd fairly di&s;prove.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I return to a Repitition of the ill U&s;age the Di&s;|&s;enters have receiv'd from the contrary Party on this Ac|count for above 30 Years; the con&s;tant Reproaches they and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
their Children after them have met with from tho&s;e Gentle|men, who on all Occa&s;ions have (as I hinted before) parti|cularly taken care to extol their own un&s;haken Fidelity to their Prince, till at la&s;t an Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents to touch them in the &s;ame mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part, <HI>their Right and Property;</HI> and <HI>alas!</HI> their Loyalty, what became of it? Truly the <HI>Faith|ful, Pa&s;&s;ively Obedient, &V;n&s;hakenly Loyal</HI> Church, return'd to the Original Nature of their Neighbours, and did the &s;ame thing exactly which the Whigs, <HI>the Factious Rebellious Whigs,</HI> had done before.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No, that's fal&s;e, (&s;ays a Di&s;ciple of Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>'s) we did not kill our King, we did not dip our Hands in Roy|al Blood, nor hurt the Lord's Anointed.</Q></P>
<P>No, that's true, but the Lord's Anointed may thank him|&s;elf for that; for my part I think the Difference only lyes here; the Whigs in 41, to 48. took up Arms again&s;t their King; and having conquer'd him, and taken him Pri&s;oner, cut off his Head, <HI>becau&s;e they had him:</HI> The Church of <HI>England</HI> took Arms again&s;t their King in 88. and did not cut off his Head, <HI>becau&s;e they had him not.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> lo&s;t his Life, <HI>becau&s;e he did not run away;</HI> and his Son, King <HI>James,</HI> &s;av'd his Life, <HI>becau&s;e he did run away.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis &s;uch a Je&s;t, &s;uch a Banter, to &s;ay, We did take up Arms, but we did not kill him: <HI>Ble&s;s us, kill our King, we wou'd not have hurt a Hair of his Head!</HI> Why, every Bullet &s;hot at the Battle of the <HI>Boyne,</HI> was a killing the King; for if you did not, 'twas becau&s;e you cou'd not hit him.</P>
<P>If a Highway-man fires at you upon the Road, when he is taken, and brought upon his Trial, our learned Recor|der, before he pronounces Sentence of Death, barangues him in this manner: <HI>And be&s;ides all this, Sir; you are plainly guilty of Murther; for you not only a&s;&s;aulted this hone&s;t Man, in order to take away his Money but you endeavour'd to murther him; for you &s;hot at him, in order to kill him; and the Intention of Murther is Equally Criminal in the Eyes of God with the Act it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Now who did we &s;hoot at, at the <HI>Boyne? 'Tis true, King</HI> James <HI>generally &s;tood out of the way;</HI> But who did we &s;hoot at? What! was our Orders to <HI>&s;ight again&s;t both &s;mall and great,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<HI>and not again&s;t the King of</HI> I&s;rael? Had your Bullets Commi&s;|&s;ion to &s;how their Loyalty, and not to touch the Lord's Anointed? If he had Charg'd in the fir&s;t Squadrons of his Hor&s;e, had you not kill'd him if you cou'd? I think this need no further Proof.</P>
<P>Nay, if Arguments may be allow'd to have equal Weight on both Sides, the Whigs have been the hone&s;ter of the two; for they never profe&s;t any &s;uch blind, ab&s;olute and undi&s;pu|ted Obedience to Princes as the others have done.</P>
<P>It has always been their Opinion. That Government was originally contrived by the Con&s;ent, and for the mutual Be|nefit of the Parties Govern'd, that the People have an Ori|ginal Native Right to their Property, the Liberty of their Per&s;ons and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, <HI>unle&s;s forefaulted to the Laws,</HI> that they cannot be dive&s;ted of this Right but by their own Con|&s;ent, and that all Inva&s;ion of this Right is de&s;tructive of the Con&s;titution, and di&s;&s;olves the Compact of Government and Obedience.</P>
<P>They have always declar'd, That they under&s;tand their Allegiance to their Governors to be, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing they Govern them according to the Laws of the Land;</HI> and that if Princes break this Bond of Government, the Nature of it is inverted, and the Con&s;titution cea&s;es of cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> in <HI>Scotland, Algernoon Sidney</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> have &s;et their Names, <HI>and the latter his Blood,</HI> to this Doctrine, and the Author of the <HI>True-born Englishman</HI> is worth quoting in the Ca&s;e;<Q><L>The Government's ungirt when Ju&s;tice dies,</L>
<L>And Con&s;titutions are Non-Entities:</L>
<L>The Nation's all a Mob, there's no &s;uch thing,</L>
<L>As Lords or Commons, Parliament or King:</L>
<L>A great promi&s;cuous Crowd the Hydra lyes,</L>
<L>Till Laws revive, and mutual Contract ties:</L>
<L>A Chaos free to chu&s;e for their own Share,</L>
<L>What ca&s;e of Government they plea&s;e to wear.</L>
<L>If to a King they do the Reigns commit,</L>
<L>All Men are bound in Con&s;cience to &s;ubmit;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11">
But then that King mu&s;t by his Oath a&s;&s;ent</L>
<L>To Po&s;tulata's of the Government.</L>
<L>Which if he breaks he cuts off the Entail,</L>
<L>And Power Retreats to its Original.</L>
<BIBL>True-born Engli&s;hman, <HI>P.</HI> 74.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This has been the avow'd Doctrine of the Di&s;&s;enters, and is indeed the true Sen&s;e of the Con&s;titution it &s;elf; pur&s;uant to this Doctrine they thought they had a Right to oppo&s;e Violence with Force; believing that when Kings break Co|ronation Oaths, the Solemn Compact with their People, and encroach upon their Civil Rights, contrary to the Laws of the Land, by which they are &s;worn to Rule, they cea&s;e to be the Lord's Anointed any longer, the Sanction of their Office is vani&s;h'd, and they become Tyrants and Enemies of Man|kind, and may be treated accordingly.</P>
<P>Now 'tis no wonder to find People of the&s;e Principles vi|gorou&s;ly with&s;tanding their Governors, when they tread upon the tender fore places of the Con&s;titution; 'tis nothing but what they all along pretended to, and declar'd to be their Opinion.</P>
<P>But to find the Church of <HI>England</HI>-Men, who&s;e Loyalty has been the Subject of a Thou&s;and Learned Authors, and numberle&s;s Sermons, who&s;e Character and Mark of Di&s;tin|ction has been cho&s;en more for her &s;teddy Adherence and Fidelity to her Prince than to God Almighty; who&s;e Obe|dience to her Monarchs has been declar'd to be Inviolate and Immoveable; and who pretends to be Famous thro' the whole World for their Faithfulne&s;s to Kings; <HI>for her,</HI> as &s;oon as ever the King did but, as it were, &s;eem to aim at cru&s;hing her Authority, as &s;oon as he did but begin to call her Clergy to an Account, and clap up her <HI>Golden Candle&s;ticks</HI> for Di&s;obedience; <HI>for her</HI> to winch and kick, fly to foreign Princes for Pro|tection, and ri&s;e in Arms again&s;t her Prince, O <HI>Pelin!</HI> O <HI>Bra|dy!</HI> O <HI>Sherlock!</HI> O <HI>Hominem!</HI> O <HI>Mores!</HI></P>

<P>The Clergy, all the Magi&s;trates and Officers of the Hou|&s;hold, of the Civil or Military Government, were Mem|bers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> otherwi&s;e they cou'd not be employ'd; the Sacramental Te&s;t has done the Di&s;&s;enters this Kindne&s;s, that 'tis plain all the Managing Hands in the King|dom were Di&s;ciples of the Church; and as an additional Circum&s;tance, the Oath of Allegiance which they took, and which was (God be prai&s;ed) of their own making, bound them to that &s;ame Ab&s;olute Blind Obedience which they profe&s;t, and confin'd it to the King, his Heirs and Succe&s;|&s;ors.</P>
<P>If this Oath be con&s;ider'd literally, I am content to be &s;i|lenc'd, when one fair Argument can be brought to evade it; the Declaration follow'd it, wherein they dete&s;t and abhor that devili&s;h Doctrine, that 'tis lawful <HI>on any pretence what|&s;oever,</HI>

<HI>(Mark the Empha&s;is)</HI> to take up Arms again&s;t the King&punc; this <HI>(equal to an Oath)</HI> is declar'd in the pre&s;ence of God; and the Particulars being material to our purpo&s;e, are as follows:<Q><P>I <HI>A.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That this Doctrine of Ab&s;olute, Pa&s;&s;ive and Non|re&s;i&s;tant Obedience, is an Ab&s;urdity in it &s;elf, contradictory to the Nature of Government and Allegiance, and political|ly introduc'd by State Engines into the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to abu&s;e her, and betray her Members into unfore&s;een Mi&s;|chiefs and Inconveniences.</P>
<P>Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Members of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are all Apo&s;tates from the very Fundamental Doctrine of their Church, Perjur'd in the Sight of God and Man, Noto|rious Hypocrites, and Deceivers; who having &s;worn Obe|dience without Re&s;erve to their Prince, are become Traitors, Rebels, and Murtherers of the Lord's Anointed, and their Lawful Sovereign; and not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, have depos'd and traiterou&s;ly dethron'd their Rightful King, God Almighty's Vicegerent, accountable to no Earthly Power, Supream under God, Ab&s;olute, and from Divine In&s;titution, Undoubted Sole Lord of them and their Country.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
Or, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That they only are the true Church of <HI>En|gland,</HI> who according to their avow'd Profe&s;&s;ion, have firm|ly adher'd to their King in all his Sufferings and Solitude, have never blacken'd their Con&s;ciences, nor gone back from their Obedience, forgotten their Oaths, nor fullied their Re|putation with the horrid Crimes of Trea&s;on and Rebellion, as they think it to be.</P>
<P>Now, as a fair Di&s;putant, I am willing the Re&s;pondent &s;hall chu&s;e which of the&s;e Three Con&s;equences he will &s;tand by in behalf of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Loyalty; but if they wou'd take the Advice of <HI>a Friend to the hone&s;t Part of them,</HI> I wou'd recommend the fir&s;t Conclu&s;ion to be fitte&s;t for them for the following Rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e &s;ince humane Infallibility is <HI>(and with good Rea|&s;on)</HI> di&s;own'd by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both for her Self and every Body el&s;e, it can be no Diminution to her Repu|tation, when &s;he has found her &s;elf mi&s;taken, and impos'd upon, to acknowledge her Error; <HI>a wi&s;e Man will always own, rather than defend a mi&s;take.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e 'tis my Opinion that their Way is hedg'd up a|gain&s;t any other pretence, Eva&s;ion, or Re&s;ervation, and therefore 'tis with me the only thing that Charity can &s;ay for them, and mu&s;t remain &s;o, till I find &s;omething el&s;e &s;aid that is more to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;chief of all is, that if this be hone&s;tly acknow|ledg'd <HI>(as is doubtle&s;s mo&s;t true)</HI> that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was mi&s;taken, and impos'd upon, to e&s;pou&s;e a Sen&s;le&s;s Ab|&s;urd Principle, contrary to the Nature of Government and Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> why then they come over to this Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>That Government and Allegiance are both Conditional, and Oaths of Subjects are always to be con&s;ider'd in a Con|&s;tructive Sence, with Conditions of Protection, and the like; a thing which is without que&s;tion the real Meaning of all Oaths of Allegiance; otherwi&s;e Subjects may be put under an ab|&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Perjury, or State Martyrdom, by often &s;wearing what may be impo&s;&s;ible for them to perform.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
The Town of <HI>Aeth</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> has been about 6 times, and the Town of <HI>Rhinebergh</HI> in <HI>Gueldre</HI> about 12 times, ta|ken and retaken; and as often as new Ma&s;ters had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place, &s;o often the poor Inhabitants have &s;worn to their new Lords: What can the meaning of &s;uch an Oath be, but that they will be faithful to them &s;o long as they keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place? 'Twou'd be ridiculous to ima|gine the Impo&s;ers of the Oath requir'd any more.</P>
<P>If our Zealous Churchmen worded an Oath contrary to the very Nature of Swearing Allegiance, let them an&s;wer for it who fir&s;t made it, then took it, then broke it. But the Nature of the thing can leave Room for no other Sug|ge&s;tion that I know of.</P>
<P>Till then &s;ome further Argument is produc'd, it mu&s;t re&s;t here, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was Mi&s;taken, Impo&s;ed upon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that &s;he finds when the Laws are Broken, the Right of the People Invaded, the Root of the Government Struck at, Church and State Undermin'd, and Di&s;potick Ty|ranny at the Door, the Native Right of the People is Supe|rior, and they may a&s;&s;ume a Power to Right them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>And &s;o we are brought back to Whiggi&s;m, and</HI> 41; <HI>and, Gen|tlemen, there is no remedy for it, help it if you can.</HI></P>
<P>Where now is the Difference between Church Loyalty, and Whiggi&s;h Loyalty, Roundhead or Cavalier, Church|man or Di&s;&s;enter, Whig or Tory? All are alike; they are pleas'd, when legally Govern'd; Quarrel&s;ome and Unruly, if Oppre&s;t; and will Defend them&s;elves, if A&s;&s;aulted; tho' it be by their Kings, or any Body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Why then is the Difference kept up? Methinks they might all be friends together, for they are all alike; the Di&s;&s;enters have been in their times as Loyal, and the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI> in their time as Di&s;loyal as one another. <HI>Vice ver&s;a</HI> the Di&s;&s;enters have been as Di&s;loyal, and the Churchmen as Loy|al as one another upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ion; they have been both Sufferers, and have &s;ubmited to the Government; ay, and to the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Per&s;ecutions of their Superiors and Sovereigns; and again, upon the like Occa&s;ions, they
<PB N="17" REF="16">
have both of them been Rebels, <HI>if their own Language may &s;o far be us'd;</HI> they have both of them, in their Turn, taken Arms again&s;t, and depos'd their Rightful and Lawful Kings.</P>
<P>So that in my Opinion, <HI>with a Latitude to all that think other|wi&s;e to think as they plea&s;e;</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> and their Neighbours the Di&s;&s;enters, have nothing to quarrel with one another about, as to Loyalty; as to other Matters I have nothing to &s;ay to them, nor &s;hall not mingle it with this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor do I think I am writing a Satyr again&s;t the Church of <HI>En|gland,</HI> nor is it at all intended to be &s;o; and to &s;top all Pre|tences that way, I take the Freedom to &s;ay here has been no Crime, the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been in the right of it; not in taking Arms, but the Error was in E&s;pou&s;ing, Cry|ing up, and Pretending to a Blind Ab&s;olute Obedience to Princes, be their Commands never &s;o Ab&s;olute, Tyrannical or Illegal; this neither the Doctrine nor Practice of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> nor of any Church or People in the Chri&s;tian World, ever pretended to; and therefore the Fault lay in tho&s;e people, who being them&s;elves Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be deluded by State-Mini&s;ters, to fo&s;ter a Tenent upon the Church which her Original Con&s;titution never pretended to, and then call it the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t beginning of their pretended Doctrine was found in <HI>Manwaring</HI>'s and <HI>Sibthorp</HI>'s Libels, in the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. cajoling the King; and then to plea&s;e him, endea|vouring to wheedle the People into a Belief of the Divine Right of Kingly Government; and affirming, that the King was not oblig'd by the Laws in the Admini&s;tration of the Government.</P>
<P>Upon this prepo&s;terous Foundation, they built the Illegi|timate Structure of Ab&s;olute Undi&s;puted Obedience; for if Kingly power were once prov'd to be immediately deriv'd from Divine Authority, Ab&s;olute Obedience wou'd be a Con|&s;equence no body could di&s;pute, &s;ince the &s;ame Obedience without re&s;erve wou'd be due to the Delegated power, as to the Power delegating.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17">
And though this is a point ea&s;ily enough confuted, yet be|ing willing to keep the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute within as &s;mall a compa&s;s as we can, I think our Argument has nothing at all to do with it.</P>
<P>Whether Government be of Divine Original or not, &s;eems not the Que&s;tion here; for if it be not &s;o, then, as before, the Church of <HI>England</HI> have been mi&s;taken, and impo&s;ed up|on; and if it be &s;o, then the Church of <HI>England</HI> has tram|pled under-foot their own Doctrine, turn'd Rebels to God, and Apo&s;tates from the Faith they have profe&s;t, have Sacri|legiou&s;ly and Traiterou&s;ly taken up Arms again&s;t their Prince, a&s;&s;aulted the Lord's Anointed, <HI>Re&s;i&s;ted the Powers which are the Ordinance of God,</HI> depo&s;ed their lawful Sovereign, broken their Allegiance, and con&s;equently <HI>are a Parcel of Perjur'd Re|bels;</HI> every jot as bad as the wor&s;t Roundhead Regicide, and Rebel of the Year Forty One.</P>
<P>What more or le&s;s can be &s;aid, I profe&s;s I know not, and am in great Expectation of &s;omething new in the Matter; for I cannot find in all the Writings I have met with, any thing to contradict it.</P>
<P>The bringing Government and Obedience to the proper Circum&s;tances of mutual Compact between King and People, &s;eems to me to be the only Method to unravel this Skein of entangl'd Principles; the Nature of Government has made it the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of all Argument relating to Po|wer; and I could give In&s;tances in all the Nations in the World, that &s;ome time or other, even the Right of Succe&s;|&s;ion to Government, <HI>which mu&s;t be as &s;acred as the Power,</HI> has been interrupted and limited by the People, in ca&s;e of Ty|ranny and Illegal Governing; and every Nation; <HI>and this a|mong the re&s;t,</HI> have often times depos'd their Princes for the pre&s;ervation of the State, when either Incapacity for Govern|ment, Tyrannical U&s;urpation, or other Male-Admini&s;tration, has been the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But this I think al&s;o needle&s;s here; every one that is vers'd in Hi&s;tory can read the numerous Examples in the Roman, Grecian and Per&s;ian Hi&s;tories, <HI>even Sacred Hi&s;tories, where</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="18">
<HI>Kings were more particularly of Divine Right than any where,</HI> are full of them; the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Spain, Portugal, France, Lom|bardy,</HI> the Empires of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> even the Papal Chair, have &s;uffer'd Convul&s;ions and Revolutions, the De|po&s;ing and Di&s;placing their Sovereigns, when the People's Good, <HI>which is, and ever was, the Soul, the Center, the End, and the Cau&s;e of all Government,</HI> came to be in the Di&s;pute.</P>

<P>The only Error we Charge upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> was &s;etting up pretences of what they really wou'd not Pra|ctice; crying up them&s;elves for Fools, when we knew they were Wi&s;er Men; calling them&s;elves humble Slaves, but when the Tryal came, proving Stubborn, Refractory, <HI>Liberty-Mongers,</HI> even as bad as the wor&s;t Whig or Phanatick of them all.</P>
<P>For the Future, then if a Humble Moderator might be permited to give Advice to the Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it &s;hou'd be in the&s;e &s;hort and friendly Terms.</P>
<P>Pray Gentlemen never be Impo&s;ed upon, to pretend to more Loyalty and more &s;lavi&s;h Principles than you intend to Practice.</P>
<P>Never pretend to more Obedience than your Sovereign Requires. Our Late King, who I am not a&s;ham'd to &s;how as a Patern for future Ages, requir'd; and Her pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty, <HI>without Affront to Her Maje&s;ty's Authority, it may be &s;aid,</HI> requires no further Obedience from the People of <HI>England,</HI> than the Laws of <HI>England</HI> requires.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
To Govern according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the People, and to obey according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the Sovereign. The Laws are the Te&s;t both of the Roy|al Authority, and of the Subjects Obedience, and to pretend to more Obedience than the Law requires, is abu&s;ing your Prince, and abu&s;ing your Selves.</P>
<P>Never be a&s;ham'd to own with <HI>your Brethren, the Whigs,</HI> that you are willing to Submit to Authority, but that you ex|pect to be Govern'd according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm.</P>
<P>Let the Scotch Motto be &s;et upon your Liberties, and ac|cording to your con&s;tant Practice, <HI>as well as ours:</HI> Let all Men know you de&s;ign to make it Good. <HI>Nemo me Impune Lace&s;&s;it.</HI></P>
<P>And as it really never was the Principle of the Church of <HI>England, nor were a hundreth Part of the Members of the Church tainted with it;</HI> &s;o for the future 'tis hoped you will not &s;uffer &s;uch to Mingle them&s;elves among you, or to Act in the Name of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who pretend to a Blind Ab&s;olute Obedience to Princes.</P>
<P>And <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Gentlemen, a little more Mode&s;ty to your Humble Servants you Prote&s;tant Brethren, the Di&s;&s;enters, or Whigs; I mean as to Matter of Loyalty: For in Truth, Gentlemen, we do not &s;ee any Rea&s;on you have to Reproach us in that Matter, you being in every Particular as faulty that way as your Neighbours.</P>
