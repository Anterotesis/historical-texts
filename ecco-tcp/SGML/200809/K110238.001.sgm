<P>HERE are we, my dear girl, in the very height of preparation. We begin our journey &s;outhward at five tomorrow morning. We &s;hall make a &s;hort &s;tay in London, and then proceed to Paris. Expectation is on tiptoe: my bu&s;y fancy
<PB N="2" REF="3">
has pictured to it&s;elf Calais, Montreuil, Abbeville, in &s;hort every place which the book of po&s;t roads enumerates, and &s;ome of which the divine Sterne has rendered &s;o famous. I expect to find nothing but mirth, vivacity, fancy, and multitudes of people. I have read &s;o much of the populou&s;ne&s;s of France, the gaiety of its inhabitants, the magnifi|cence of its buildings, its fine climate, fertility, numerous cities, &s;uperb roads, rich plains, and teeming vineyards, that I already imagine my&s;elf journeying through an enchanted land.</P>
<P>I have another plea&s;ure in pro&s;pect. Pray have you heard that your brother is &s;oon to be at Paris, on his return from Italy?&mdash;My father &s;urpri&s;ed me by informing me we &s;hould probably
<PB N="3" REF="4">
meet him in that capital. I &s;u&s;pect Sir Arthur of an implication which his words perhaps will not authorize; but he a&s;ked me, rather &s;ignificantly, if I had ever heard you talk of your bro|ther; and in le&s;s than five minutes wi&s;hed to know whether I had any ob|jections to marriage.</P>
<P>My father is exceedingly bu&s;y with his head man, his plotter, his planner; giving directions concerning &s;till further improvements that are to be made, in his grounds and park, during our ab&s;ence. You know his mania. Improvement is his di&s;ea&s;e. I have before hinted to you that I do not like this factotum of his, this Abimelech Henley. The amiable qualities of his &s;on more than compen|&s;ate for the meanne&s;s of the father;
<PB N="4" REF="5">
whom I have long &s;u&s;pected to be and am indeed convinced that he is artful, &s;elfi&s;h, and hone&s;t enough to &s;eek his own profit, were it at the expence of his employer's ruin. He is continually in&s;inuating new plans to my father, whom he Sir Arthurs, and Honours, and Nobles, at every word, and then per&s;uades him the hints and thoughts are all his own. The illiterate fellow has a language peculiar to him&s;elf; energetic but half unintelligible; compounded of a few fine phra&s;es, and an inundation of proverbial wi&s;dom and uncouth cant terms. Of the &s;canty number of polite words, which he has endeavoured to catch, he is very bountiful to Sir Arthur. <Q>That's noble! That's great your no|ble honour! Well, by my truly,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
that's an <HI>elegunt ideer!</HI> But I always &s;aid your honour had more <HI>nobler</HI> and <HI>elegunter ideers</HI> than any other noble gentleman, knight, lord, or dooke, in every thing of what your honour calls the grand gu&s;to.</Q> P&s;haw! It is ri|diculous in me to imitate his language; the cunning non&s;en&s;e of which evapo|rates upon paper, but is highly cha|racteri&s;tic when delivered with all its attendant bows and cringes; which, like the accompaniments to a concerto, en|force the character of the compo&s;ition, and give it full effect.</P>
<P>I am in the very mid&s;t of bandboxes, portmanteaus, packing-ca&s;es, and travel|ling trunks. I &s;carcely ever knew a mind &s;o &s;luggi&s;h as not to feel a certain degree of rapture, at the thoughts of
<PB N="6" REF="7">
travelling. It &s;hould &s;eem as if the imagination frequently journeyed &s;o fa&s;t as to enjoy a &s;pecies of ec&s;ta&s;y, when there are any hopes of dragging the cumbrous body after its flights.</P>
<P>I cannot bani&s;h the hints of Sir Arthur from my bu&s;y fancy.&mdash;I mu&s;t not I ought not to practi&s;e di&s;gui&s;e with any one, much le&s;s with my Loui&s;a; and I cannot but own that his que&s;tions &s;ugge&s;ted a plan of future happine&s;s to my mind, which if realized would be delightful. The brother of my dear Loui&s;a, the cho&s;en friend of my heart, is to be at Paris. I &s;hall meet him there. He cannot but re&s;emble his &s;i&s;ter. He can|not but be all genero&s;ity, love, expan|&s;ion, mind, &s;oul! I am determined to have a very &s;incere friend&s;hip for him;
<PB N="7" REF="8">
nay I am in danger of falling in love with him at fir&s;t &s;ight! Loui&s;a knows what I mean by falling in love. Ah, my dear friend, if he be but half equal to you, he is indeed a matchle&s;s youth! Our &s;ouls are too intimately related to need any nearer kindred; and yet, &s;ince marry I mu&s;t, as you emphatically tell me it will &s;ome time be my duty to do, I could almo&s;t wi&s;h Sir Arthur's que&s;tions to have the meaning I &s;u&s;pect, and that it might be to the brother of my friend.</P>
<P>Do not call me romantic: if romance it be, it originates in the &s;upreme &s;ati&s;|faction I have taken in contemplating the powers and beauties of my Loui&s;a's mind. Our acquaintance has been but &s;hort, yet our friend&s;hip appears as if it
<PB N="8" REF="9">
had been eternal. Our hearts under&s;tand each other, and &s;peak a language which, alas, we both have found to be unintel|ligible to the generality of the world.</P>
<P>Once more adieu. You &s;hall hear from me again at London. Direct to me as u&s;ual in Gro&s;venor Street.</P>

It is &s;urely the mo&s;t intel|ligent of all animals; the unfeathered bipeds, as the French wits call us two|legged mortals, excepted. But no won|der: it was my Loui&s;a's gift; and, ki&s;&s;ing her lips, imbibed a part of her &s;pirit. Were I to leave it behind me, cats, and other good for nothing crea|tures, would teach it again to be &s;hy, and &s;u&s;picious; and the pre&s;ent charm|ing exertion of its little faculties would decay. The developement of mind, even in a bird, has &s;omething in it highly delightful.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
Why, my Loui&s;a, my friend, my &s;i&s;ter, ah, why are not you with me? Why do you not participate my plea|&s;ures, catch with me the ri&s;ing ideas, and enjoy the raptures of novelty? But I will forbear. I have before in vain ex|hau&s;ted all my rhetoric. You mu&s;t not, will not quit a langui&s;hing parent; and I am obliged to approve your determi|nation, though I cannot but regret the con&s;equence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Ro&s;e Bank.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HEALTH, joy, and novelty attend the &s;teps of my ever dear and charming Anna! May the whirling of your cha|riot wheels bring a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thoughts as exhilarating as they are rapid! May gladne&s;s hail you through the day, and peace hu&s;h you to &s;leep at night! May
<PB N="12" REF="13">
the hills and valleys &s;mile upon you, as you roll over and be&s;ide them; and may you meet fe&s;tivity and fulne&s;s of content at every &s;tep!</P>
<P>I too have my regrets. My heart is one-half with you; nay my beloved, my generous mamma has endeavoured to per&s;uade me to quit her, arguing that the inconvenience to her would be more than compen&s;ated by the benefit accru|ing to my&s;elf. The dear lady, I &s;incerely believe, loves you if po&s;&s;ible better than &s;he does me, and pleaded &s;trenu|ou&s;ly. But did &s;he not know it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould prevail? She did. If my cares can prolong a life &s;o pre|cious but half an hour, is it not an age? Do not her virtues and her wi&s;dom communicate them&s;elves to all around
<PB N="13" REF="14">
her? Are not her re&s;ignation, her for|titude, and her cheerfulne&s;s in pain, le&s;&s;ons which I might traver&s;e kingdoms and not find an opportunity like this of learning? And, affection out of the que&s;tion, having &s;uch high duties to perform, mu&s;t I fly from &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion, afflicting though it be? No! Anna St. Ives her&s;elf mu&s;t not tempt me to that. She is indeed too noble &s;eriou&s;ly to form &s;uch a wi&s;h. An&s;wer, is &s;he not?</P>
<P>Oh that I may be deceived, but I fear you expect too much from my brother. Oh that he might be worthy of my Anna! Not for my own &s;ake; for, as &s;he truly &s;ays, we [That is our fouls, for I know of no other we. We] cannot be more akin; but for his own.
<PB N="14" REF="15">
He is the &s;on of my beloved mother, and mo&s;t devoutly do I wi&s;h he might be found de&s;erving of her and you. He would then be more de&s;erving than any man, at lea&s;t any young man, I have ever known. Though brother and &s;i&s;ter, he and I may be &s;aid to have but little acquaintance. He has always been either at &s;chool, or at college, or in town, or on his travels, or in &s;ome place where I did not happen to be, except for &s;hort intervals. I have told you that his per&s;on is not di&s;plea&s;ing, that his temper appears to be prompt and daring, but gay, and that his manners I doubt are of that free kind which our young gentlemen affect.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth however, I have heard much in favour of Coke Clifton;
<PB N="15" REF="16">
but then it has generally been either from per&s;ons who&s;e good word was in my opinion no prai&s;e, or from others who evidently meant to be civil to me, or to the family, by &s;peaking well of my bro|ther. I believe him to have much pride, &s;ome ambition, a high &s;en&s;e of fa&s;hion|able honour; that he &s;purns at threats, di&s;dains reproof, and that he does not want genero&s;ity, or tho&s;e accompli&s;h|ments which would make him pa&s;s with the world for a man who&s;e alliance would be de&s;irable. But the hu&s;band of my Anna [you perceive I have caught your tone, and u&s;e the word hu&s;band as familiarly as if there were any &s;erious in|tention of &s;uch an event, and as if it were any thing more than the &s;portive effu&s;ion of fancy, or rather the momen|tary
<PB N="16" REF="17">
expan&s;ion of friend&s;hip] the hu&s;|band of my Anna ought to be more, infinitely more, than what the world un|der&s;tands by &s;uch phra&s;es; if it can be &s;aid to under&s;tand anything. Forgive the jingle, but, to pair with her, he ought to be her peer. And yet if &s;he wait till time &s;hall &s;end her &s;uch a one, and that one every way proper for her alliance, in her father's opinion as well as in her own, I am afraid her chance of marriage will be infinitely &s;mall.</P>
<P>Were I but a&s;&s;ured that Coke Clifton would be as kind and as worthy a hu&s;|band, to Anna St. Ives, as any other whom it were probable accident &s;hould ever throw in her way, I &s;hould then indeed &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;h &s;uch a thought might be &s;omething more than the tran|&s;ient
<PB N="17" REF="18">
flight of fancy. But enough. You are on the wing to the city where you and he will probably meet. Examine him well; forget his &s;i&s;ter; be true to your&s;elf and your own judgment, and I have no fear that you &s;hould be deceived. If he prove better even than a &s;i&s;ter's hopes, he will find in me more than a &s;i&s;ter's love.</P>
<P>I like Sir Arthur's favourite, Abime|lech Henley, &s;till le&s;s than you do. My fears indeed are rather &s;trong. When once a ta&s;te for improvement [I mean building and gardening improvement] becomes a pa&s;&s;ion, gaming it&s;elf is &s;carce|ly more ruinous. I have no doubt that Sir Arthur's fortune has &s;uffered, and is &s;uffering &s;everely; and that while that mi&s;erly wretch, Abimelech, is de&s;troying
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the fabric, he is purloining and carrying off the be&s;t of the materials. I doubt whe|ther there be an acre of land in the oc|cupation of Sir Arthur, which has not co&s;t ten times its intrin&s;ic value to make it better. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how Sir Ar|thur can be [pardon the expre&s;&s;ion, my dear] &s;uch a dupe! I have before blamed, and mu&s;t again blame you, for not exert|ing your&s;elf &s;ufficiently to &s;hew him his folly. It concerns the family, it concerns your&s;elf, nearly. Who can tell how far off the moment is when it may be too late? My mamma has ju&s;t heard of a new mortgage, in procuring of which the worthy Abimelech acted, or pretended to act, as agent: for I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;u&s;|pect he was really the principal. Dur|ing my la&s;t vi&s;it, if I do not mi&s;take, I
<PB N="19" REF="20">
&s;everal times &s;aw the pride of wealth be|traying it&s;elf; and only &s;ubdued by the &s;uperior thir&s;t of gain.</P>
<P>Poor Frank Henley! Is it not mira|culous that &s;uch a father &s;hould have &s;uch a &s;on? I am tempted to give utter|ance to a &s;trange thought! Why &s;hould I not? What is the opinion of the world; what are its prejudices, in the pre&s;ence of truth? Yet not to re&s;pect them is to entail upon our&s;elves I know not what load of acrimony, contempt, and mi&s;ery! I mu&s;t &s;peak&mdash;I never yet met a youth whom I thought &s;o de&s;erv|ing of Anna St. Ives as Frank Henley! The ob&s;tacles you will &s;ay are in&s;ur|mountable. Alas! I fear they are. And therefore 'tis fortunate that the &s;ame thought has not more &s;trongly occurred
<PB N="20" REF="21">
to you. Perhaps my caution would have been greater, but that I know your af|fections are free; and yet I confe&s;s I wonder that they are &s;o. If it be the effect of your rea&s;on, the prai&s;e you me|rit is infinite: and I hope and believe it is; for, notwith&s;tanding all the tales I have heard and read, my mind is con|vinced of nothing more firmly than that the pa&s;&s;ion of love is as capable of being repre&s;&s;ed, and conquered, as any other pa&s;&s;ion whatever: and you know we have both agreed that the pa&s;&s;ions are all of them &s;ubject to rea&s;on, when rea&s;on is &s;ufficiently determined to exert its power.</P>

<P>OLIVER, I am wretched! The fee|ble Frank Henley is a poor mi&s;erable being! The &s;un &s;hines, the birds war|ble, the flowers &s;pring, the buds are bur&s;ting into bloom, all nature rejoices; yet to me this mirth, this univer&s;al joy, &s;eems mockery&mdash;Why is this? Why do
<PB N="22" REF="23">
I &s;uffer my mind thus to be pervaded by melancholy? Why am I thus &s;teeped in gloom?</P>
<P>She is going&mdash;Thur&s;day morning is the time fixed&mdash;And what is that to me?&mdash;Madman that I am!&mdash;Who am I? Does &s;he, can &s;he, ought &s;he to think of me?&mdash;And why not? Am I not a man; and is &s;he more than mortal?&mdash;She is! She is!&mdash;Shew me the mortal who pre|&s;umes to be her equal!</P>
<P>But what do I wi&s;h? What would I have? Is it my intention or my de&s;ire to make her wretched? What! Sink her whom I adore in the e&s;timation of the world; and render her the &s;coff of the fooli&s;h, the vain, and the malignant?&mdash;I!&mdash;I make her wretched!&mdash;I!&mdash;</P>
<P>Oliver, &s;he treats me with indiffe|rence&mdash;
<PB N="23" REF="24">
cold, calm, killing indifference! Yet kind, heavenly kind even in her coldne&s;s! Her cheerful eye never turns from me, nor ever &s;eeks me. To her I am a &s;tatue&mdash;Would I were! Why does &s;he not hate me? Openly and ab&s;olutely hate me!&mdash;And could I wi&s;h her to love? Do I love? Do I? Dare I? Have I the temerity &s;o much as to &s;u&s;pect I love?&mdash;Who am I?

<P>But I?&mdash;Low bred and vulgar let Pride and Error call me, but not villain! I the &s;educer of men's daughters! No|ble

men and &s;till nobler daughters! I! Why, would I be &s;o very vile a thing? Would I, if I could?</P>
<P>Yet who &s;hall benumb the under&s;tand|ing, chain up the fancy, and freeze &s;en|&s;ation? Can I command my&s;elf deaf when &s;he &s;ings, dead when &s;he &s;peaks, or ru&s;h into idioti&s;m to avoid her enchant|ments?</P>
<P>De&s;pi&s;e me, Oliver, if thou wilt, but the deep &s;en&s;e I have of my own folly does but increa&s;e the di&s;temper of my brain. She her&s;elf pities me, yet does not &s;u&s;|pect my di&s;ea&s;e. 'Tis evident &s;he does not; for her &s;oul is above artifice. She kindly a&s;ked&mdash;was I not well? I owned I was not quite &s;o cheerful as I could wi&s;h to be; and [would&s;t thou think it?] was pre&s;umptuous enough to hint that
<PB N="25" REF="26">
I thought the enlivening air of France might do me good. Thou &s;ee&s;t how frantic I am! She an&s;wered with the ut|mo&s;t ea&s;e, and without the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;picion of my &s;elfi&s;h, my audacious mo|tive, that &s;he would &s;peak to Sir Arthur. But I was obliged to reque&s;t her to for|bear, till I had fir&s;t tried to gain my fa|ther's con&s;ent, of which indeed I had but feeble hopes.</P>
<P>Every way mi&s;erable, why am I oblig|ed to think and &s;peak of my father with &s;o little re&s;pect? Indeed he is&mdash;Well, well!&mdash;He is my father&mdash;I am con|vinced he is become wealthy; nay in|deed he gives me to under&s;tand as much, when he wi&s;hes to gain any purpo&s;e, by endeavouring to excite avarice in me,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
which he hopes is, and perhaps &s;uppo&s;es mu&s;t be, mine and every man's ruling pa&s;&s;ion. Yet, no; he cannot: his com|plaints of me for the want of it are too heartfelt, too bitter.</P>
<P>He has kept me in ignorance, as much as was in his power. Reading, writing, and arithmetic is his grand &s;y&s;tem of education; after which man has nothing more to learn, except to get and to hoard money. Had it not been for the few books I bought and the many I bor|rowed, together with the e&s;&s;ential in|&s;truction which thy excellent father's learning and philanthropy enabled and induced him to give me, I &s;hould pro|bably have been as illiterate as he could have wi&s;hed. A &s;on after his own heart!
<PB N="27" REF="28">
One of his mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate reproaches is <Q>the time I <HI>wa&s;te</HI> in reading.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;carcely need tell thee he was almo&s;t in a rage, at my reque&s;t to accompany Sir Arthur to France; &s;tating, as I did, that it ought to be and mu&s;t be at his expence. Otherwi&s;e he cares but little where I go, being rather regarded by him as a &s;py on his actions than as his &s;on. Thou can&s;t not conceive the con|tempt with which he treats me, for my want of cunning. He de&s;pi&s;es my &s;en&s;e of philanthropy, honour, and that &s;evere probity to which no laws extend. He &s;purns at the po&s;&s;ibility of preferring the good of &s;ociety to the good of &s;elf&mdash;But, once again, he is my father.</P>
<P>Prithee lend me thy Petrarch, and

&s;end it in return by Thomas. I had no|thing to &s;ay, though I have written &s;o much, except to a&s;k for this book, and to burden thee with my complaints. Re|member me kindly to thy mo&s;t worthy father, and all the family. Thine,</P>

<P>OH, Loui&s;a! I have &s;uch a narra|tive! Such accidents! Such&mdash;! But you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>We are arrived; and, thank God and good fortune, are all alive; which, every thing con&s;idered, is no &s;mall con&s;olation. The chai&s;e was at the door punctually at
<PB N="30" REF="31">
five on Thur&s;day morning. Abimelech Henley had been very bu&s;y with Sir Ar|thur over night; and was in clo&s;e con|ference with him again previous to our departure.</P>
<P>Frank too was there, as di&s;con&s;olate and as attentive as ever; active and watchful that every thing was as it &s;hould be. How the difference between &s;oul and &s;oul di&s;covers it&s;elf in &s;uch &s;cenes! I very much fear his father treats him unkindly, and that he grieves more than he ought; nay more than a per&s;on of his youth, &s;trong form, and &s;till &s;tronger mind, could be &s;uppo&s;ed to grieve. I under&s;tand he very much la|ments the lo&s;s of a college education, which the mi&s;er his father could very well have be&s;towed upon him, had not

his heart been as contracted as the mouth of his pur&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Trenchard, luckily for Frank, early di&s;covered his genius, and gratui|tou&s;ly aided him in his &s;tudies. Frank reveres him as a more than father, and loves his &s;on Oliver like a brother. He is but too &s;en&s;ible that a true father feeds the mind, and that he who only provides for the body is no better than a &s;tep-fa|ther. I have &s;ome fear that there is ano|ther cau&s;e for his di&s;&s;atisfaction, and that he has cheri&s;hed &s;ome &s;illy thoughts of an impo&s;&s;ible nature. If &s;o, an effort mu&s;t be made which I hope will re&s;tore him to rea&s;on. And yet what right have I to conclude that he rea&s;ons erroneou&s;ly? Have I &s;ufficiently examined? This is a que&s;tion which has &s;everal times lately
<PB N="32" REF="33">
forced it&s;elf upon my mind. I am not in&s;en&s;ible of his high worth: it opens upon me daily. What I am going to relate will picture that worth better than any prai&s;e of mine. I will therefore con|tinue my narrative.</P>
<P>Every thing being adju&s;ted, off we went; I, Laura, and Sir Arthur, in the chai&s;e, and one footman only with us, who was to ride before as our courier, and prepare hor&s;es.</P>
<P>I told you of my intention to take King Pepin with me; but the morning of our departure was all hurry, and it &s;eldom happens that &s;omething is not forgotten, amid the tumult into which the pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem to plunge as it were with delight, gratified with the confu&s;ion which them&s;elves create. I mu&s;t own I
<PB N="33" REF="34">
was vexed and offended with my&s;elf, when I found that the &s;omething over|looked on this occa&s;ion was the gift of my Loui&s;a. Ingratitude with all its re|proaches ro&s;e up to &s;ting me; and I immediately re&s;olved to puni&s;h my&s;elf, by informing my Loui&s;a how unworthy I am of the gifts of &s;uch a friend. It was at the fir&s;t &s;tage where we changed hor&s;es that I made this di&s;covery. One moment I was inclined to petition Sir Arthur to &s;tay, while a me&s;&s;enger &s;hould be &s;ent; but the next I determined that my fault &s;hould incur its due pains and penalties.</P>
<P>Every thing was ready; but ju&s;t as we had &s;eated our&s;elves in the chai&s;e, and were again proceeding on our jour|ney, one of the &s;ervants of the inn called
<PB N="34" REF="35">
to Sir Arthur to &s;top, for young Mr. Henley was coming up full &s;peed on the bay mare. Frank and the bay mare are both famous through the whole coun|try. My father immediately progno&s;ti|cated &s;ome bad accident, and I began to be alarmed. Our fears however were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, his only errand being to bring my charming favourite.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was not a little moved by this mark of attention, which indeed is but one among many, as well as by the peculiarity of the youth's manner in de|livering the bird. He was fearful, vi&s;i|bly fearful, that his de&s;ire to oblige &s;hould be thought officious. He at|tempted to apologize, but knew not what to &s;ay. I thanked him very &s;in|cerely, and in the kinde&s;t manner I could;
<PB N="35" REF="36">
and, &s;eeing him booted, the thought in|&s;tantly &s;truck me to reque&s;t Sir Arthur's permi&s;&s;ion for him to accompany us to London, which I imagined might give him plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The reque&s;t happened to coincide with &s;ome new project of alteration which Sir Arthur had conceived, and which, he &s;aid, after having further dige&s;ted, he could better communicate to Frank than de&s;cribe on paper. The mare is &s;aid to be one of the be&s;t travellers in the kingdom; and, as &s;he was very capable of performing the journey, and the car|riage being rather heavily loaded, he ac|cordingly kept pace with us.</P>
<P>During the day we pa&s;&s;ed many de|lightful &s;cenes, and enjoyed the charm|ing pro&s;pects which the rich cultivation
<PB N="36" REF="37">
of England, and the road we travelled, afford. Frank Henley was &s;carcely ever out of &s;ight, though he was rather watch|fully a&s;&s;iduous than communicative.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur, for his part, did not forget to point out to us what a charming park &s;uch and &s;uch grounds might be turned into; how picture&s;que a temple, or a church &s;teeple, would look in this place; what a fine effect a &s;heet of water would have in that bottom; and how nobly a clump of trees would embelli&s;h the hill by which it was overlooked.</P>
<P>I believe I am a &s;ad wicked girl, Loui&s;a! I was once &s;trangely tempted to tell him I was much afraid his father had mi&s;taken the trade to which his ge|nius was be&s;t adapted, when he made him a baronet in&s;tead of a gardener.
<PB N="37" REF="38">
However I had the grace to bite my tongue and be &s;ilent. He might have had the retort courteous upon me, and have replied that gardening was much the mo&s;t honourable trade of the two. But he would never have thought of that an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Thus the day, as I tell you, pa&s;&s;ed plea&s;antly and whim&s;ically enough. But the night! Oh!&mdash;The night!&mdash;You &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>It was the du&s;k of evening when we were at Maidenhead. We had then three &s;tages to go, and Sir Arthur began to be alarmed by the rumours of depre|dations which had lately been committed on the road. I really do not know what to &s;ay to it; but there appears to be &s;omething deeper in the doctrine of &s;ym|pathies
<PB N="38" REF="39">
than &s;uch &s;illy girls as I can either account for or comprehend. I en|deavoured with all my might to oppo&s;e the &s;en&s;ation, and yet I found my father's fears were catching. Frank Henley in|deed begged of me, with great energy, not to be alarmed; for that he would die &s;ooner than I &s;hould be in&s;ulted. Upon my honour, Loui&s;a, he is a gallant youth!&mdash;You &s;hall hear&mdash;But he is a brave, a gallant youth.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay but I wi&s;hed I were a man; though I am convinced it was a fooli&s;h wi&s;h, and that it is a great mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e courage has any connexion with &s;ex; if we except, as we ought, the influence of education and habit. My dear mother had not the bodily &s;trength of Sir Arthur; but, with re&s;pect to cool
<PB N="39" REF="40">
courage and active pre&s;ence of mind, I mu&s;t &s;ay, Loui&s;a, there was no compa|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>We &s;et off, however, Frank having fir&s;t provided him&s;elf with a hanger and a pair of pi&s;tols; and he now kept clo&s;e to the chai&s;e-door, without once quitting his &s;tation. I believe Sir Arthur was heartily glad at being thus provided with a guard, as it were unexpectedly, and without any fore&s;ight of his own. For, not to mention gold watches and trin|kets, he had more money with him than he would have cho&s;en to have lo&s;t, fright out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We proceeded thus without mole&s;ta|tion as far as Brentford; but not with|out receiving fre&s;h hints that it was very po&s;&s;ible we might be vi&s;ited; and then,
<PB N="40" REF="41">
though it began to be drawing toward midnight, Sir Arthur thought the dan|ger chiefly over. As it happened he was mi&s;taken. He was indeed, my dear! I a&s;&s;ure you I could tremble now with the thoughts of it, but that my woman|hood forbids. I remember how valiant I have been in laughing at the pretty fears of pretty ladies, with their &s;alts, hart&s;horn, fits, and burnt feathers. Be|&s;ide, I would not have my Loui&s;a think too meanly of me. Yet I a&s;&s;ure you it was a terrible night.</P>
<P>We had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the broad part of Turnham Green, as Frank has &s;ince told me, and were near the end of a lane which &s;trikes into the Uxbridge road, when the po&s;tillion was &s;topped by one highwayman, while almo&s;t at the &s;ame
<PB N="41" REF="42">
in&s;tant another da&s;hed his pi&s;tol through the &s;ide-gla&s;s into the chai&s;e, full in Sir Arthur's face.</P>
<P>Frank was on my &s;ide&mdash;Notwith&s;tand|ing the length of the journey, he &s;eemed to infu&s;e his own ardour into the &s;pirited animal on which he rode, and was round in&s;tantaneou&s;ly&mdash;It was really dreadful!&mdash;The highwayman &s;aw, or rather heard him coming, for it was prodigiou&s;ly dark, and fired. Poor Frank was &s;hot!&mdash;In the &s;houlder&mdash;But he &s;ays he did not feel it at fir&s;t&mdash;He returned the fire; and the highwayman exclaimed, with a &s;hocking oath, "I am a dead man!" He rode away however full &s;peed; and his a&s;&s;ociate, who &s;tood to guard the po&s;t|boy, rode after him. Frank imagines that, owing to the darkne&s;s of the night,
<PB N="42" REF="43">
and his being &s;o clo&s;e under the chai&s;e, they had not perceived him when they came to the attack.</P>
<P>But here let me tell you, for I am &s;ure I ought, our protector, our hero is not dangerou&s;ly wounded. He indeed makes very light of it; but I am per|&s;uaded he would do that if he had lo&s;t an arm. The moment the highwaymen were gone, he rode round to me to intreat me not to be alarmed, for that all was &s;afe.</P>
<P>Imagine whether I did not thank him, and ble&s;s him; at lea&s;t in ejaculation. Imagine what I felt, after what I <HI>had</HI> heard, at hearing him talk to me, and at being convinced that he was actually alive. I had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his being wounded, he &s;poke &s;o cheer|fully;
<PB N="43" REF="44">
yet I naturally enquired if he were hurt. His an&s;wer was&mdash;"No no&mdash;Not <HI>hurt"</HI>&mdash;But he &s;poke with an empha&s;is that immediately rai&s;ed my appre|hen&s;ions. I repeated my que&s;tion&mdash;"Are you &s;ure you are not hurt; not wounded?" He could not &s;ay no to that, and therefore an&s;wered&mdash;"He be|lieved he felt a &s;light contu&s;ion in the &s;houlder; but that he was convinced it was trifling."</P>
<P>I was now &s;eized with a fit of terror much greater, in effect, than my former panic. I fervently intreated Sir Arthur to let the &s;ervant take the bay mare, and ride for help! I begged, urgently, vio|lently, for God's &s;ake, that he would take my place in the chai&s;e! I would mount
<PB N="44" REF="45">
the mare my&s;elf! I would do any thing! All the replies I could get were &s;till more vehement interce&s;&s;ions from Frank Hen|ley, that I would not be alarmed, a&s;&s;ur|ances that there was not the lea&s;t danger, the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate determination not to quit his po&s;t, and, notwith&s;tanding the pain which he could not but feel, a per|&s;i&s;ting to reload the di&s;charged pi&s;tol, and then to proceed.</P>
<P>I know not my&s;elf how my fears were &s;o far pacified as to yield to this, except that his energy &s;eemed to overpower mine. Indeed I &s;uffered dreadfully the re&s;t of the way. I knew the youth's ge|nerous &s;pirit, and my imagination was haunted with the idea, that the blood was flowing every foot of the road, and that
<PB N="45" REF="46">
he would rather drop from the hor&s;e than be &s;ubdued. It is impo&s;&s;ible, indeed it is, to tell you what I felt.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we arrived in Gro&s;venor Street; and &s;ure enough the poor fellow was faint with the lo&s;s of blood. "My God!"&mdash;&s;aid I to Sir Arthur, when the light was brought, and I &s;aw him&mdash;"Send for a &s;urgeon! Good Heavens! Run! Somebody run for help!"&mdash;He &s;till in&s;i&s;ted he was but &s;lightly hurt, and began to re&s;ume all his earne&s;tne&s;s to quiet me. Sir Arthur did it more effec|tually by &s;ending as I de&s;ired, and by telling me that, if I continued to agitate by contending with him &s;o much, I might very po&s;&s;ibly throw him into a fever, and make a wound, which mo&s;t probably was not in it&s;elf dangerous, mortal.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
I &s;aid not another word, except &s;eri|ou&s;ly and &s;olemnly reque&s;ting him to calm his mind, for his own &s;ake, if not for mine; for that, after being wounded in defence of me and my father, to die by my fault were dreadful indeed. He retired with more apparent &s;atisfaction in his countenance than I think I ever &s;aw before.</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved however not to go to bed, till I had received &s;ome account from the &s;urgeon. He came, the wound was examined, and word was immedi|ately &s;ent me, by the expre&s;s command of Frank, who had been told I was &s;it|ting up for that purpo&s;e, that there was, as he had a&s;&s;ured me, no danger. The &s;urgeon indeed thought proper to qualify it with no <HI>great</HI> danger. It is an old re|mark
<PB N="47" REF="48">
that &s;urgeons are not prone to &s;peak too lightly of the miracles they perform. This &s;hort &s;yllable, great, did not fail however to di&s;turb me very con|&s;iderably. I waited till the ball was ex|tracted, and [Would you believe it?] brought us; for I in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing it. Sir Arthur called me a mad girl, adding there was no ruling me. I per&s;i&s;ted in que&s;tioning and cro&s;s-examining the &s;urgeon, till I was convinced that, as he &s;aid, there was no <HI>great</HI> danger; and I then retired to re&s;t: that is, I retired to the &s;ame &s;wimming motion which the chai&s;e had communicated to my nerves, or my brain, or I know not what, and to dreaming of &s;words, pi&s;tols, murdered men, and all the horrid ramblings of the fancy under &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49">
To convince me how trifling the hurt was, the gallant Frank in&s;i&s;ted the next day on coming down to dinner; though he was allowed to eat nothing but chicken broth, and a light pudding. I never &s;aw him &s;o lively. His only pre&s;ent danger of death, he &s;aid, was by famine; and complained jocularly of the hard|&s;hip of fa&s;ting after a long journey. I could almo&s;t have per&s;uaded him to eat, for indeed he is a brave, a noble youth.</P>
<P>I know I never need apologize to my Loui&s;a for the length of my letters. How can we enjoy equal plea&s;ure to that of thus conver&s;ing in de&s;pite of di&s;tance, and though &s;eparated by &s;eas and moun|tains? Indeed it is a kind of privation to end; but end I mu&s;t&mdash;therefore&mdash;Adieu.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU did not expect, dear Oliver, to receive a letter from me dated at this di&s;tance. By the luckie&s;t accident in the world, I have been allowed to accom|pany her thus far, have ridden all day with my eye fixed upon her, and at night have had the ec&s;tatic plea&s;ure to defend, to fight for her! Perhaps have
<PB N="50" REF="51">
&s;aved her life! Have been wounded for her!&mdash;Would I had been killed!&mdash;Was there ever &s;o fooli&s;h, &s;o wrong, &s;o romantic a wi&s;h? And yet it has ru&s;hed involuntarily upon me fifty times. To die for her &s;eems to be a bli&s;s which mortal man cannot merit! Truth, &s;evere truth, perhaps, will not ju&s;tify the&s;e ef|fu&s;ions. I will, I do, endeavour to re&s;i&s;t them.&mdash;Indeed I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf, for I find I am very feeble. Yet let not thy fears be too violent for thy friend: he will not lightly de&s;ert his duty.</P>
<P>Let me tell thee, before I proceed, that my wound is &s;light.&mdash;We were &s;topped by a couple of highwaymen. Thou never wert a witne&s;s of &s;uch an|gelic &s;en&s;ibility as the divine creature di&s;covered, when &s;he found I had re|ceived
<PB N="51" REF="52">
&s;ome hurt. She alarmed me beyond de&s;cription, by the exce&s;s of her feelings. Oh! She has a &s;oul alive to all the throbs of humanity! It &s;hoots and &s;hivers in every vein!&mdash;Then too when we arrived, when candles were brought [I had bled &s;omewhat freely, and I &s;uppo&s;e looked rather pale] thou ha&s;t no conception of, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the energy with which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ending for the be&s;t and mo&s;t immediate help.</P>
<P>We had another battle of &s;en&s;ibility; for I a&s;&s;ure thee I was almo&s;t as much [Did I not know her I &s;hould &s;ay more.] alarmed for her as &s;he could be for me.</P>
<P>Yet do not imagine I am fool enough to flatter my&s;elf with any fal&s;e hopes.
<PB N="52" REF="53">
No: it was humanity; it was too deep a &s;en&s;e of a &s;light benefit received; it was totally di&s;tinct from love.&mdash;Oh no! Love, added to &s;uch &s;trong, &s;uch acute &s;en&s;ations, &s;urely, Oliver, it would have &s;hrieked, would have fainted, would have died!&mdash;Her fears and feelings were powerful I grant, but they were all &s;ocial, and would have been equally awakened for any creature whom &s;he had known, and had equal cau&s;e to e&s;teem. And &s;he e&s;teems all who hav but the &s;malle&s;t claims to &s;uch re&s;pect; even me!&mdash;Did I tell thee it was &s;he who petitioned Sir Arthur to lay his commands on me to attend them to London, knowing I wi&s;hed it; and that this was in return for the trifling favour I had done her, in galloping after her
<PB N="53" REF="54">
with her favourite bird? Oh! She is all benignity! All grace! All angel!</P>
<P>Never did I feel &s;uch raptures as &s;ince I have received this fortunate, this happy wound!&mdash;Yet why?&mdash;Is not her heart exactly what it was? It is. I &s;hould be an idiot not to perceive it is. Strange contradiction! Hopele&s;s yet happy!&mdash;But it is a felicity of &s;hort du|ration.</P>
<P>Would it were po&s;&s;ible for me to accompany her to France! My re&s;tle&s;s foreboding imagination has per&s;uaded me &s;he will be in danger the moment &s;he is from under my protection. Vain fool! Who, what am I?&mdash;Becau&s;e a couple of da&s;tardly highwaymen have galloped away at the fir&s;t report of a
<PB N="54" REF="55">
pi&s;tol, my inflated fancy has been bu&s;y in per&s;uading me that I am her hero!</P>
<P>Yet I wi&s;h I might go with her! Tell me, Oliver, would&s;t not thou wi&s;h &s;o too? Would not all the world wi&s;h the &s;ame? Did&s;t thou ever in thy life behold her without feelings unu&s;ual, throbs, doubts, de&s;ires, and fears; wild, incoherent, yet deriving ec&s;ta&s;y from that divinity which irradiates her form and beams on every object around her?&mdash;Do!&mdash;Think me a poor, raving, love&s;ick blockhead! And yet it is true! All I have &s;aid of her, and infinitely more, is true! Thou nor the world cannot di&s;prove it! Would I might go with her!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="55" REF="56">
<P>I have &s;een the fellow with whom I had the rencounter. His wound is much more &s;evere than mine. Sir Ar|thur &s;ent information to the office in Bow Street Would&s;t thou think a high|wayman could be &s;o fooli&s;h a coxcomb as to rob in a bright &s;carlet coat, and to ride a light grey hor&s;e? The blood|hunters [I am &s;orry that our ab&s;urd, our iniquitous laws oblige me to call them &s;o] the blood-hunters &s;oon di&s;covered the wounded man. Forty pounds af|forded a &s;ufficient impul&s;e. They were almo&s;t ready to quarrel with me, becau&s;e I did not choo&s;e to &s;wear as heartily as they thought proper to prompt. Thou knowe&s;t how I abhor the taking away the life of man, in&s;tead of &s;eeking his refor|mation.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
After per&s;i&s;ting that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to identify the per&s;on of the highwayman, as indeed it really was, and luckily prevailing on Sir Arthur to do the &s;ame [though he, like mo&s;t folks who have any thing to lo&s;e, was con|vinced it would be an excellent thing if all rogues could be in&s;tantly hanged, like dogs, out of the way] I paid the poor wretch a vi&s;it, privately, and gave him &s;uch a lecture as, I &s;hould hope, he would not ea&s;ily forget. It was not all cen|&s;ure: &s;oothing, rea&s;oning, and menace were mingled. My greate&s;t effort was to convince him of the folly of &s;uch crimes; he had received fome proof of the danger. He was in great pain, and did not think his life quite &s;ecure. He promi&s;ed reformation with all the appa|rent
<PB N="57" REF="58">
fervour of &s;incerity, prayed for me, ble&s;&s;ed me very heartily, and prai&s;ed me for my bravery. He &s;ays the Bow Street runners will leave nothing unattempted to &s;ecure the reward, and take away his life. I have therefore engaged to hire a lodging, and bring a hackney coach for him my&s;elf, at &s;even in the morning, the hour lea&s;t likely for him to be watched or traced. I believe I was more earne&s;t to prevent harm happening to him than he him&s;elf was; for, having met a man upon the &s;tairs, who&s;e phy&s;iognomy, dre&s;s and appearance led me to &s;u&s;pect him, I que&s;tioned my penitent, who owned it was his accomplice; a determined fel|low, according to his account; an Iri&s;h gambler, who&s;e daring character led
<PB N="58" REF="59">
him, after a run of ill luck, to this de&s;|perate re&s;ource. It was with &s;ome diffi|culty I could per&s;uade him the fellow might betray him, and join the Bow Street people. The gambler, as he &s;ays, expects a &s;upply, and has promi&s;ed him money. But he has con&s;ented to leave his lodging; and I think I have con|vinced him of the folly, danger, and guilt of &s;uch connections.</P>
<P>I found he was poor, and, except a few &s;hillings, left him the trifle of money which I had; endeavouring by every means to re&s;tore a lo&s;t wretch to virtue and &s;ociety. The fellow was not flint. The tears gu&s;hed into his eyes, and I own I came away with hopes that my efforts had not been wholly inef|fectual.</P>

<P>FRANK HENLEY's accident has nece&s;&s;arily delayed our journey for a fortnight; nay, it was within an ace of being delayed for ever, and [Would you think it po&s;&s;ible?] by the artful remon|&s;trances of this Abimelech Henley. I have been obliged to exert all my influ|ence, and all my rhetoric, upon Sir
<PB N="73" REF="74">
Arthur, or it would have been entirely given up. Rapacious and narrow in his own plans, this wretch, this <HI>hone&s;t Aby,</HI> as my father calls him, would not wil|lingly &s;uffer a guinea to be &s;pent, except in improvements: that is, not a guinea which &s;hould not pa&s;s through his hands. A letter from him to Sir Arthur has been the cau&s;e of this con|te&s;t.</P>
<P>I hope however, my dear, that Sir Arthur's affairs are not in &s;o bad a train as your fears [expre&s;&s;ed in your letter of the third] cau&s;e you to imagine. Should they be &s;o, what will become of my brother? A mere man of fa&s;hion! Active in the whole etiquette of vi&s;iting, dre&s;&s;ing, driving, riding, fencing, dan|cing, gaming, writing cards of compli|ment,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
and all the frivolous follies of what, by this cla&s;s of people, is called <HI>the world;</HI> but indolent in, or more properly incapable of all u&s;eful duties.</P>
<P>I &s;tand rather high in his opinion, and he has done me the honour to con|&s;ult me lately on a family affair. The Edgemoor e&s;tate, of eight hundred per annum, is entailed on him, as the heir of St. Ives, by my grandfather's will; with right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the age of twenty-four. Sir Arthur I &s;uppo&s;e does not find it convenient to abridge his income &s;o materially, and has been en|deavouring to per&s;uade him that it is his duty and intere&s;t not to in&s;i&s;t upon po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent. My brother is not plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al, and has complai&s;antly written to a&s;k my
<PB N="75" REF="76">
opinion, with an evident determination to follow his own, he having now almo&s;t completed his twenty-fourth year. My an&s;wer was an attempt [I fear a vain one] to call to his mind the true u&s;e of money; and, unle&s;s he &s;hould have found the art of employing it worthily, I advi&s;ed him to &s;hew his filial affection and oblige Sir Arthur.</P>
<P>I can prophe&s;y however that he will have no forbearance. Not to mention debts, he has too many imaginary and impatient wants to &s;ubmit to delay. Nei|ther have I any great de&s;ire that he &s;hould; being convinced that the want of money is the only impediment that can put a &s;top to Sir Arthur's improvements.</P>
<P>But this hone&s;t Aby!&mdash;The &s;ame po&s;t that brought me your letter of the
<PB N="76" REF="77">
eleventh <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This and other letters are occa&s;ionally omitted, as not containing any new information.</NOTE>, brought one for Sir Arthur; and while I was meditating on the con|tents of yours, and not a little chagrined at the confirmation of your intelligence concerning the mortgage&mdash;[Chagrined that my father &s;hould be the in&s;trument, the tool of &s;uch a fellow: chagrined that his family &s;hould be in danger, and him&s;elf made a je&s;t]&mdash;while I was con&s;i|dering what were the be&s;t means, if there were any, of inducing Sir Arthur to abandon projects &s;o fooli&s;h, and &s;o fatal, Laura came running with the news that our journey to France was all over, that orders to that effect had been given, and that a chai&s;e was to be
<PB N="77" REF="78">
at the door in an hour, to take Sir Arthur back to Wenbourne-Hill.</P>
<P>This incident, in my then temper of mind, produced its full effect. I knew Sir Arthur's way: I knew he would not willingly &s;ee me him&s;elf; and, immedi|ately &s;u&s;pecting that his letter was from hone&s;t Aby, I determined if po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould not e&s;cape me. He was in his own room; and how to draw him out? An hour would &s;oon be gone! I there|fore employed an artifice, which, on after recollection, I am convinced was wrong; very wrong! I went into the drawing-room, and bade the footman go to him and announce Mi&s;s Wen|bourne. I have a maiden aunt of that name, whom I was chri&s;tened after, who lives in London, and whom I believe
<PB N="78" REF="79">
you never &s;aw. The trick &s;ucceeded, and Sir Arthur came into the drawing|room. He looked di&s;concerted at &s;eeing me, and the following dialogue began.</P>
<P>Heydey, Anna! Where is your aunt?</P>
<P>Sir, I am afraid I have done an unju&s;tifiable thing. [My con&s;cience then fir&s;t &s;mote me, with a conviction that what I had per&s;uaded my&s;elf was a defen&s;ible artifice was neither more nor le&s;s than a direct fal&s;ehood; which of all crimes, you know, I think one of the mo&s;t mean, hateful, and pernicious. The ju&s;t confu&s;ion I felt had nearly ruined my cau&s;e.]</P>
<P>Why!&mdash;What!&mdash;What do you mean?&mdash;Where is your aunt?</P>
<P>She is not here, &s;ir. It was I who wi&s;hed to &s;peak to you.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">
You! And &s;end in your aunt's name?</P>
<P>My name is Wenbourne, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Your name is St. Ives, mi&s;s.</P>
<P>I feel, &s;ir, how exceedingly culpable I am; and perhaps do not de&s;erve that you &s;hould pardon me. [My father began to &s;u&s;pect the rea&s;on of my wi&s;hing to &s;peak with him, and did not know whether good nature or ill would &s;erve his cau&s;e the be&s;t. I per|ceived him ca&s;t an eye toward the door.]</P>
<P>This is extraordinary!&mdash;Very ex|traordinary, upon my &s;oul!</P>
<P>[I &s;aw it was time to recover my &s;pirits.] I have heard &s;omething which I &s;carcely can believe to be true, &s;ir.</P>
<P>What have you heard? What have you heard?</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81">
That you are going back to Wen|bourne-Hill.</P>
<P>Well, what then?</P>
<P>And that you do not intend we &s;hould vi&s;it France.</P>
<P>Who told you &s;o?</P>
<P>The &s;ervants have orders to that effect.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants are a parcel of bu&s;y blockheads!</P>
<P>What can have occa&s;ioned you, &s;ir, to change your opinion &s;o &s;uddenly?</P>
<P>My affairs. [He looked again to|ward the door, but he felt it was too late; and that he mu&s;t now either de|fend or abandon his cau&s;e.] The journey will be too expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>If, &s;ir, the journey would in the lea&s;t embarra&s;s your affairs, and if I did not daily &s;ee you entering into expences &s;o
<PB N="81" REF="82">
infinitely greater than this, I would not an&s;wer a word to &s;uch an argument. I think it my duty to be as careful of your property as you your&s;elf could be; and for that rea&s;on have often wi&s;hed I could prevail on you, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to alter your plans.</P>
<P>I have no doubt, mi&s;s, of your pro|digious wi&s;dom; you remind me of it daily. Your plans to be &s;ure would, as you &s;ay, be infinitely better than mine. When you are married, or I am dead, you may do as you plea&s;e; but, in the mean time, &s;uffer me to act for my&s;elf. I do not choo&s;e to be under tute|lage.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, my dear papa, to &s;ee that I offend you; but indeed I mean the very rever&s;e. Indeed I do! It is my
<PB N="82" REF="83">
zeal for your intere&s;t, my love of you, [I ventured to take his hand] that oblige me to &s;peak&mdash;</P>
<P>And plainly to tell me you do not approve of my proceedings!</P>
<P>Plainly to tell you the truth, becau&s;e I believe it to be my duty.</P>
<P>Upon my word! A very dutiful daughter! I thought the duty of chil|dren was to obey the wills of their pa|rents.</P>
<P>Obedience&mdash;[Pardon my &s;incerity, &s;ir.]&mdash;Obedience mu&s;t have limits. Children &s;hould love and honour their parents for their virtues, and &s;hould cheerfully and zealou&s;ly do whatever they require of them, which is not in it&s;elf wrong.</P>
<P>Of which <HI>children</HI> are to judge?</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">
Yes, &s;ir: of which children are to judge.</P>
<P>A fine &s;y&s;tem of obedience truly!</P>
<P>They cannot act without judging, more or le&s;s, be they obedient or di&s;o|bedient: and the better they judge the better will they perform their duty. There may be and there have been mi&s;taken parents, who have commanded their children to be guilty even of crimes.</P>
<P>And what is that to me? Upon my word, you are a very polite young lady! A very extraordinarily polite mi&s;s!</P>
<P>God forbid, my dear papa, that you &s;hould imagine I think you one of tho&s;e parents.</P>
<P>I really don't know nor don't care,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
madam, what you think me.&mdash;My plans, indeed!&mdash;Di&s;approved by you!</P>
<P>If I &s;aw any per&s;on under a dangerous mi&s;take, mi&s;led, wronged, preyed upon by the &s;elf-intere&s;ted, &s;hould I not be indolent or cowardly, nay &s;hould I not be criminal, if I did not endeavour to convince &s;uch a per&s;on of his error? And what &s;hould I be if this per&s;on were my father?</P>
<P>Upon my honour, mi&s;s, you take into|lerable liberties! The licen&s;e of your tongue is terrible!</P>
<P>It were better, &s;ir, that I &s;hould &s;ub|ject my&s;elf to your di&s;plea&s;ure, and make you think unkindly of me, than that others, who pretend to be your &s;ervants and your humble but friendly advi&s;ers,
<PB N="85" REF="86">
&s;hould injure&mdash;&s;hould&mdash;I know not what! We have often heard of &s;tew|ards, who have acted the mortgagee to their own ma&s;ters. [This hint was a thunder &s;troke. Sir Arthur was wholly di&s;concerted. His mind apparently made &s;everal attempts to recover it&s;elf; but they were all ineffectual.]</P>
<P>Well, well&mdash;I, I&mdash;I know what the meaning of all this is. You&mdash;You are vexed at being di&s;appointed of your journey&mdash;But make your&s;elf ea&s;y, child; you &s;hall go: you &s;han't be di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>'Tis true, &s;ir, I wi&s;h to vi&s;it Paris; but not if it will be in the lea&s;t inconve|nient to you, in money affairs. Though I own I &s;hould indeed be vexed to &s;ee the &s;mall &s;um you had appropriated for
<PB N="86" REF="87">
this journey wre&s;ted from you, to throw up a hill, or build a fanta&s;tic temple in &s;ome place where its very &s;ituation would render it ridiculous.</P>
<P>Upon my word!&mdash;Was ever the like of this heard?&mdash;Don't I tell you, you &s;hall go?</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ir, going is but a &s;mall part of the &s;ubject: there is another point, which, if I could but gain, would give me infinitely more plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>P&s;haw! Girl! I can't &s;tay to argue points with you now! I tell you, you &s;hall go. I give you my word you &s;hall go; and &s;o let's have no more of it.&mdash;Do you hear, Anna? I am too old to be &s;chooled. I don't like it! Mind me! I don't like it!</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry, &s;ir, that I can|not
<PB N="87" REF="88">
find words to &s;peak the truth which would be le&s;s offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>I tell you again there is no truth to be &s;poken! Have not I promi&s;ed you &s;hall go? There's an end of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s. You &s;hall go.</P>
<P>And away went Sir Arthur; appa|rently happy to get rid both of me and him&s;elf: that is, of the di&s;agreeable ideas which, as he thought, I had &s;o imperti|nently rai&s;ed. You blamed me in your la&s;t for not exerting my&s;elf &s;ufficiently, to &s;hew him his folly. You &s;ee the &s;ufficiently is &s;till wanting. Perhaps I have not di&s;covered the true mode of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Sir Arthur's pa&s;|&s;ions. For, though my remon&s;trances have often made him unea&s;y, I cannot perceive that they have ever produced
<PB N="88" REF="89">
conviction. And yet I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that a certain degree of momentary con|viction mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of &s;uch con|ver&s;ations. But the fortitude to ca&s;t off old habits, and a&s;&s;ume new, is be|yond the &s;trength of common mortals.</P>
<P>Frank Henley is a favourite with you, and very de&s;ervedly. But, in an&s;wer to the &s;urpri&s;e in your former, my dear, that he has never engaged my affections, as well as to the cautionary kind hints in your two la&s;t, for &s;o I under&s;tand them, let me &s;ay that, had I imagined love to be that unconquerable fatality of which I have been &s;peaking, I do not know what might have happened: but, hav|ing been early convinced that a union between him and me mu&s;t be attended with I know not what &s;cenes of wretch|edne&s;s,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
in &s;hort, knowing the thing in a certain &s;en&s;e to be impo&s;&s;ible, it has al|ways been &s;o con&s;idered by me, and therefore I have no rea&s;on to think my|&s;elf in any danger. Doubts occa&s;ionally ri&s;e in my mind, but in general &s;oon di&s;|appear. Should they return I will not conceal them.</P>
<P>I remember it was a remark of yours that "Admiration is the mother of love." So it is, of love &s;uch as I bear to my Loui&s;a; and of &s;uch perhaps as angels might be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear to angels. I admire Frank Henley, greatly, ardently admire him; yet I certainly do not love: that is, I certainly do not permit my&s;elf to feel any of tho&s;e anxieties, alarms, hopes, fears, perturbations, and endearments, which we are told are in&s;eparable from
<PB N="90" REF="91">
that pa&s;&s;ion. I extingui&s;h, I &s;uffocate them in their birth.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SIR ARTHUR ST. IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your letter, good Abimelech, and own your rea&s;oning has its force. Much is yet to be done to Wenbourne-Hill. Year after year I have &s;aid&mdash;"This &s;hall be the la&s;t: we will now bring affairs to a fini&s;h." But improvement is my delight; walking,
<PB N="92" REF="93">
talking, &s;itting, &s;tanding, or lying, wak|ing or &s;leeping, I can think of nothing el&s;e. We live you know, hone&s;t Aby, only to amend: &s;o that, in&s;tead of con|cluding, I find more things to do at pre|&s;ent than ever.</P>
<P>I have the wilderne&s;s very much at heart: but the &s;oil is excellent, and I &s;carcely know, Aby, how we &s;hall make the land &s;ufficiently barren. Yet it would have a fine effect! Yes, that it certainly would, and we will try our ut|mo&s;t. The hermitage too at the far end! The mo&s;s-grown cell, Aby! With a few &s;cattered eglantines and wild roots! We will plant ivy round the three old oaks, and bring a colony of owls to breed! Then at the bottom of all a grotto: Oh! it will be delicious!</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">
Shells will be expen&s;ive, for we are not within forty miles of the &s;ea. But no matter: it mu&s;t and it &s;hall be done, for I have &s;et my heart on it. Nay, from what you &s;aid to me, hone&s;t Aby, know|ing you to be a careful thrifty fellow, full of fore&s;ight, I was &s;o warm in the cau&s;e that I had determined to take your advice, and renounce or defer the journey to France; but the blabbing &s;ervants got a hint of the matter, and it came to my daughter's ears. So, for peace and qui|etne&s;s &s;ake, I think I mu&s;t e'en indulge her, and take her a &s;hort trip to the con|tinent. But we will go no further than the neighbourhood of Paris. Be&s;ide I wi&s;h, for my own part, to &s;ee how the country is laid out. I am de&s;irous to
<PB N="94" REF="95">
know whether all France has any thing to equal Wenbourne-Hill.</P>
<P>And yet, Aby, I find it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e every body. You know what continual improvements I have been making, for the&s;e la&s;t twenty years; for you have &s;uperintended them all. I have planted one year, and grubbed up the next; built, and pulled down; dug, and filled up again; removed hills, and &s;ent them back to their old &s;tations; and all from a determination to do whatever could be done. And now, I believe, there are no grounds in all England &s;o wooded and &s;hut in as tho&s;e of Wen|bourne-Hill; notwith&s;tanding its &s;itua|tion on a very commanding eminence. We are &s;urrounded by coppices, groves,
<PB N="95" REF="96">
e&s;paliers, and plantations. We have ex|cluded every vulgar view of di&s;tant hills, intervening meadows, and exten&s;ive fields; with their in&s;ignificant green her|bage, yellow lands, and the weari&s;ome eternal waving of &s;tanding corn.</P>
<P>And yet, Aby, after having done all this, comes me Sir Alexander Ever|green, and very freely tells me that we have &s;poiled Wenbourne-Hill, buried our&s;elves in gloom and darkne&s;s, and &s;hut out the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in all Eng|land! Formerly the hall could be &s;een by travellers from the road, and we our|&s;elves had the village church in view, all of which we have now planted out of &s;ight! Very true: but, in&s;tead of the pari&s;h &s;teeple, have we not &s;teeples of our own in every direction? And, in&s;tead of
<PB N="96" REF="97">
the road, with the Glouce&s;ter&s;hire hills and le&s;&s;ening clouds in per&s;pective, have we not the cedar quincunx? Yet &s;ee the cur&s;e of ob&s;tinacy and want of ta&s;te! Would you think it, Aby? Of this Sir Alexander complains!</P>
<P>It is in vain to tell him that we are now all within our&s;elves; that every bo|dy is &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee how &s;nug we are; and that nobody can &s;u&s;pect &s;o many temples, and groves, and terraces, and a&s;cents, and de&s;cents, and clumps, and &s;hrubberies, and vi&s;tas, and glades, and dells, and canals, and &s;tatues, and rocks, and ruins are in exi&s;tence, till they are in the very mid&s;t of them. And then! Oh how have I enjoyed their admiration! Nothing is &s;o great a plea&s;ure to me as to bring a gentleman of ta&s;te, who knows
<PB N="97" REF="98">
how to be &s;truck with what he &s;ees, and &s;et him down in the middle of one of my great gravel walks! For all the world allows, Abimelech, that our gravel walks at Wenbourne-Hill are &s;ome of the broade&s;t, the &s;traighte&s;t, and the fine&s;t in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Yet ob&s;erve how men differ, Abime|ech. Sir Alexander wants me to turf them over! He &s;ays that, where you may have the &s;mooth verdure, gravel walks are ridiculous; and are only tole|rable in common pathways, where con|tinual treading would wear away the green&s;ward. But I know what has given him &s;uch a love for the &s;oft gra&s;s. Sir Alexander is gouty, and loves to tread on velvet.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide he is a cynic. He blames all
<PB N="98" REF="99">
we have done, and &s;ays he would render one of the de&s;erts of Arabia the garden of Eden, with the money we have wa&s;ted in improving Wenbourne-Hill; which he affirms, before we touched it, was one of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;pots in the three kingdoms.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, Aby, that, if as I &s;aid I did not know him to be a cynic, I &s;hould be heartily vexed. But it either is, or at any rate it &s;hall be, one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful &s;pots in the three kingdoms, ay or in the whole world! Of that I am re&s;olved; &s;o go on with your work, Abimelech. Do not be idle. The love of fame is a noble pa&s;&s;ion; and the name of Arthur St. Ives &s;hall be remembered at Wen|bourne-Hill, long after his remains are laid in their kindred clay, as the poet &s;ays.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">
I de&s;ired your &s;on Frank to accom|pany us to London. He is a &s;pirited young fellow, and behaved well on the road, where he had an affair with a high|wayman, and got a &s;light wound; but he is in no danger. He is a fine fellow, a brave fellow, and an honour to you, hone&s;t Aby.</P>
<P>Some grounds which I &s;aw on my journey, with water purling, meander|ing, and occa&s;ionally da&s;hing down a &s;teep declivity, or winding along a more gentle de&s;cent, as it happened to be, &s;ugge&s;ted an idea to me. It came into my mind that, as we lie high, if we had but a lake &s;ufficiently large on the top of the hill, we could &s;end the water down in rivulets on every &s;ide. But then the difficulty &s;truck me how to get it
<PB N="100" REF="101">
up again. Perhaps it may be overcome. It would have a charming effect, and we will think of it hereafter.</P>
<P>When you have received my addre&s;s at Paris, do not fail to let me know, once a week, how every thing proceeds. Be particular in your accounts, and do not be afraid of wearying me. My heart is in my grounds and my improve|ments; and the more places and things you name the more plea&s;ure you will give me. Write to me too concerning my herd of deer, my Spani&s;h &s;heep, my buffaloes, my Chine&s;e phea&s;ants, and all my foreign live &s;tock.</P>
<P>I will make my journey as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible; it &s;hall not be long before I will re-vi&s;it my Wenbourne-Hill. To own the truth, hone&s;t Aby, after read|ing
<PB N="101" REF="102">
your letter, I had ordered the chai&s;e to the door to come down again; but Anna St. Ives would not hear of it, &s;o I was obliged to yield. But, as I tell you, my heart is with you; Wenbourne-Hill is never out of my mind.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h you to be cautious in your communications, Abimelech, con|cerning our money matters. My daugh|ter gave me a hint about the la&s;t mort|gage, which I did not half like. Chil|dren think they have a right to pry into a father's expences; and to curb and brow-beat him, if the money be not all &s;pent in gratifying their whims. Be more clo&s;e, Abimelech, if you would oblige me.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST. IVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Ro&s;e-Bank.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM exce&s;&s;ively angry with my&s;elf, my dear Anna. I have not treated you with the open confidence which you de|&s;erve, becau&s;e I have had improper fears of you. I have doubted le&s;t an exce&s;s of friend&s;hip and genero&s;ity &s;hould lead you into mi&s;take, and in|duce
<PB N="103" REF="104">
you to think well of my brother rather for my &s;ake than for his own. But the more I reflect the more I am convinced that duplicity never can be virtue.</P>
<P>Your la&s;t letter has brought me to a &s;en&s;e of this. The noble &s;incerity with which you immediately accu&s;ed your&s;elf, for having practi&s;ed an artifice [which I, like you, do not think was innocent, becau&s;e artifice cannot be innocent] has taught me how I ought to act; and Sir Arthur's caprice is an additional incitement.</P>
<P>I have for &s;ome time known that it has been very much de&s;ired by my mamma to &s;ee you and Coke Clifton united. She mentioned her wi&s;h to Sir Arthur, and he &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the idea. She did me the honour to
<PB N="104" REF="105">
con&s;ult me; and I oppo&s;ed precipitate proceedings, and &s;trenuou&s;ly argued that all &s;uch events ought to take their na|tural cour&s;e.</P>
<P>This was the origin of your pre&s;ent journey to Paris; and I con&s;equently was enjoined &s;ecrecy, of the propriety of which I doubted at the moment. I am now convinced that &s;ecrets are al|ways either fooli&s;h or pernicious things, and that there ought to be none.</P>
<P>The ficklene&s;s of Sir Arthur however, relative to this journey, both &s;urpri&s;es and pains me. It &s;hews his weakne&s;s as well as the power of his favourite, Abi|melech, to be greater than even I ima|gined; and my former thoughts were not very favourable. After having con|certed this plan with my mamma, and
<PB N="105" REF="106">
after preparing and proceeding a part of the way, I can &s;carcely imagine what excu&s;e he would have made to her.</P>
<P>His mentioning my brother to you likewi&s;e &s;urpri&s;ed me. In conver&s;ing with my mamma, I had told her that, if &s;uch an event were to take place, it were de&s;irable that you and my brother &s;hould become acquainted, before any hint or propo&s;al ought to be made to you. I at pre&s;ent believe this to have been wrong and weak advice; but it prevail|ed, and the arrangement was that my mamma &s;hould write to Coke Clifton, to direct his route through Paris; that he &s;hould be there at a fixed time, to tran&s;act &s;ome pretended bu&s;ine&s;s for her; that Sir Arthur and you &s;hould make a journey thither on a party of plea&s;ure,
<PB N="106" REF="107">
which we all knew would be agreeable to you; and that you and my brother &s;hould meet as if by accident. But it appears that Sir Arthur, when he has any favourite project in view, can &s;carcely forbear being communicative, not from principle but from incontinence.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my brother, having told you all that has pa&s;&s;ed, I have only to add, it is my earne&s;t advice that you &s;hould be careful to put no deception on your&s;elf, but to &s;ee him as he is. His being the brother of your friend cannot give him dignity of mind, if he have it not already. Were I a thou&s;and times his &s;i&s;ter, I could not wi&s;h him another wife &s;o de&s;erving as my Anna. But &s;i&s;ter &s;hall be no motive with me to make me de&s;irous of &s;eeing per&s;ons
<PB N="107" REF="108">
united who&s;e &s;entiments and &s;ouls may be di&s;&s;imilar. Had I not &s;o much con|fidence in your di&s;cernment, and truth to your&s;elf, I &s;hould not be without un|ea&s;ine&s;s. My opinion is that the par|ties &s;hould them&s;elves reciprocally di&s;co|ver tho&s;e qualities which ought mutu|ally to fit them for the friend&s;hip of mar|riage. Is not that the very phra&s;e, Anna; <HI>the friend&s;hip of marriage?</HI> Surely, if it be not friend&s;hip, according to the be&s;t and highe&s;t &s;en&s;e in which that word is u&s;ed, marriage cannot but be &s;omething faulty and vicious.</P>
<P>I know how readily you will forgive the wrong I have done you by this con|cealment; becau&s;e you will perceive I acted from well meant but mi&s;taken &s;en|timents. I have told my mamma my
<PB N="108" REF="109">
pre&s;ent thoughts, and have &s;hewed her all the former part of this letter, which &s;he approves. Her affection for me makes her delight in every effort of my mind to ri&s;e &s;uperior to the prejudices that bring mi&s;ery into the world; and I often fear le&s;t this affection &s;hould de|prive her of that force, and acumen, which in other in&s;tances would be ready to detect error, whenever it &s;hould make its appearance.</P>
<P>I need not tell my Anna how tenderly &s;he joins with me, in wi&s;hing her a &s;afe and plea&s;ant journey. All other mat|ters &s;he entirely commits to my Anna's penetration, and di&s;cretion.</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu.

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> My brother is not rich, but has
<PB N="109" REF="110">
great expectations. This as I imagine occa&s;ioned Sir Arthur to receive the propo&s;al with plea&s;ure; and my mamma tells me they had &s;ome talk of &s;ettle|ments. He was exceedingly warm and active, in contriving this journey, for a few days; after which I thought I ob|&s;erved his ardour abate. And the pro|bability is that Abimelech, from the fir&s;t, had oppo&s;ed the excur&s;ion; but that further conver&s;ations with my mam|ma, and the plea&s;ure which the projected journey had given you, kept Sir Arthur to his purpo&s;e. I own I began to &s;u&s;pect that, &s;hould &s;uch a match take place, the recollection of parting with money, which he would willingly have expended on improvements, had influenced his conduct; and it is &s;ome relief to
<PB N="110" REF="111">
hope that he was rather acted upon than acting, if he really did feel any wi&s;h to retract. How far he may be, or may have been, acted upon in other in|&s;tances, as well as this, is &s;till a further que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;hake off a doubt which hangs on my mind; though I have been debating all morning whether I ought to mention it or be &s;ilent. I &s;u&s;pect that you your&s;elf have not &s;olved it entirely to your own &s;atisfaction. Frank Hen|ley!&mdash;It is I think indubitable that he loves you.&mdash;He would make you hap|pier than perhaps any other man could upon earth. Be not &s;wayed by your affection for me: beware of any &s;uch weakne&s;s. That you could love him if you would permit your&s;elf, nay that you
<PB N="111" REF="112">
are obliged to exert your whole force not to love him, I am convinced. You are con&s;cious of it your&s;elf.&mdash;Is your deci|&s;ion ju&s;t?&mdash;Indeed it is a &s;erious que&s;tion. What is the magnitude of the evil which would re&s;ult from &s;uch a union; and what the good? Enquire&mdash;I give no opinion. There is a mi&s;t before my eyes, and I dare not give any, till I can &s;ee more di&s;tinctly. Think, be ju&s;t, and re&s;olve. Your own judgment ought to determine you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor-Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OLIVER, what are we? What is man? What is virtue? What is honour?&mdash;My pride has received a wound much more acute than that which the ball of the highwayman inflicted on my body&mdash;I have had money palmed upon me&mdash;Money!&mdash;A man cannot behave as he
<PB N="113" REF="114">
ought, and as it would be contemptible not to behave, but he mu&s;t be paid! His vices are paid! His virtues are paid!&mdash;All is mercenary! I to be &s;ure mu&s;t be one of the number!&mdash;A twenty pound bank note, I tell thee, forced upon me by Sir Arthur!&mdash;No, no&mdash;Not by him&mdash;He never could have made me accept what I &s;uppo&s;ed [fal&s;ely, however; as fact and reflection have &s;ince led me to &s;u&s;pect] it was mean and degrading to accept. She only could prevail. She who&s;e commands are irre&s;i&s;tible, and who conde&s;cended to entreat!&mdash;Her eye gli&s;tening with a tear, which &s;he with difficulty detained in its beauteous or|bit, &s;he entreated!&mdash;There was no op|po&s;ing &s;uch interce&s;&s;ion! Her eloquence was heavenly! God be prai&s;ed that it
<PB N="114" REF="115">
was &s;o! For, as it has happened, I am per&s;uaded it has pre&s;erved a poor di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed creature from phren&s;y&mdash;Have pa|tience, and I will tell thee.</P>
<P>I had removed my penitent, and had been taking a &s;hort airing in the park; and, as I was returning, I &s;aw a crowd collected in a court. Led by curio&s;ity to enquire what was the matter, I was told that two men had ju&s;t been pur&s;u+ing a third over the roofs of the neigh|bouring hou&s;es; and that, having been obliged to de&s;cend through a trap-door, they had followed him, where it was &s;uppo&s;ed he had at la&s;t been taken. I a&s;ked what his crime was, but nobody knew. Some believed him to be a thief, &s;ome thought it was a pre&s;s-gang, and others conjectured they were bailiffs.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116">
It was not long, however, before a decent, well-looking, and indeed hand|&s;ome young woman, with a fine child in her arms, came running up the court, made her way through the crowd with terror in her countenance, and with the mo&s;t piercing cries demanded&mdash;<Q>Where is he?&mdash;Where is my dear Harry?&mdash;Who has &s;een him? Where is he?</Q></P>
<P>Some of the people pointed out the hou&s;e. She knocked violently, conti|nued her cries and lamentations, and at la&s;t gained admittance.</P>
<P>Her grief was &s;o moving, &s;o &s;ympa|thetic, that it excited my compa&s;&s;ion, and made me determine to follow her. Accordingly I elbowed my way, though I felt that I rather di&s;turbed the &s;ur|geon's dre&s;&s;ing; but that was a trifle.
<PB N="116" REF="117">
I followed her up &s;tairs without cere|mony. With re&s;pect to her, affection, <Q>ma&s;terle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, had &s;wayed her to its mood;</Q>&mdash;&s;he was not to be re|pul&s;ed.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner and his pur&s;uers had de&s;cended to the &s;econd floor, in which the poor fugitive had endeavoured to &s;eek refuge, but not &s;oon enough to find protection from the bailiffs, as they proved and as he knew them to be. Never did&s;t thou &s;ee terror &s;o &s;trong, nor affection &s;o pathetic, as this ex|cellent young woman, his wife, di&s;co|vered. Excellent I am certain &s;he is. She wrung her hands, &s;he fell on her knees, &s;he held up her babe; and, finding the&s;e were ineffectual, &s;he &s;creamed agonizing prayers to &s;ave her
<PB N="117" REF="118">
Harry. The idea &s;he had conceived of the lo&s;s of liberty, and the mi&s;eries of a pri&s;on, mu&s;t have been dreadful. But tears and prayers and cries were vain; &s;he was pleading to the deaf, or at lea&s;t to the obdurate.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the violence of her grief gave a momentary re&s;pite, I enquired what the &s;um was for which he was in thraldom, and found it to be &s;ixteen pounds, be&s;ide co&s;ts. It was not a debt originally contracted by him&s;elf; it was for a note, in which he had joined to &s;erve his wife's brother. It &s;eems they are a young couple, who by their in|du&s;try have collected a trifling &s;um, with which they have taken a &s;mall &s;hop. I did not a&s;k of what kind. She &s;erves her cu&s;tomers, and he follows his trade,
<PB N="118" REF="119">
as a journeyman carpenter. It did not a little plea&s;e me to hear the young creature accu&s;e her brother of being fal&s;e to his friend; while the hu&s;band defend|ed him, and affirmed it could be nothing but nece&s;&s;ity. I could perceive how|ever that &s;he grieved to think her bro|ther was not &s;o good as &s;he could have wi&s;hed him to be.</P>
<P>The horros of a jail were &s;o im|pre&s;&s;ed, &s;o rooted in her fancy, that &s;he was willing to &s;ell any thing, every thing; &s;he would give them all &s;he had, &s;o that her Harry might not be dragged to a damp, foul dungeon; to darkne&s;s, bread and water, and &s;tarving. Thou can&s;t not imagine the volubility with which her pa&s;&s;ions flowed, and her terrors found utterance, from the hope that it was not
<PB N="119" REF="120">
po&s;&s;ible for Chri&s;tian hearts to know all this, and not be moved to pity.</P>
<P>I am well per&s;uaded however that, had I not been there, tho&s;e good Chri&s;ti|ans the bailiffs would have paid no other attention to her panic than to &s;ee how it might be turned to profit. The mi&s;|creants talked of five guineas, for the pretended ri&s;k they &s;hould run, in giving him a fortnight to &s;ell his effects to the be&s;t advantage. They too could recom|mend a broker, a very hone&s;t fellow&mdash;By what &s;trange gradations, Oliver, can the heart of man become thus corrupt? The harpies looked hatefully.</P>
<P>Luckily I happened to have the twen|ty pound note, which pride had bidden me reject with &s;o much &s;corn, in my pocket. Thou, I am certain, wilt not
<PB N="120" REF="121">
a&s;k what I did with it. I immediately tendered tho&s;e &s;ame Chri&s;tians I told thee of their money. The ra&s;cals were di&s;ap|pointed, and would have been &s;urly; but a &s;ingle look &s;ilenced their in&s;olence. One of them was di&s;patched, according to form, to &s;ee that there were no de|tainers; and, being paid, they then &s;et their pri&s;oner free.</P>
<P>Now, if thou thinke&s;t, Oliver, thou can&s;t truly figure to thy&s;elf the overflow|ing gratitude of the kind young creature, the wife, thou art egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. She fell on her knees to me, &s;he ble&s;&s;ed me, prayed for me, and &s;aid I was an angel from heaven, &s;ent to &s;ave her dear Harry from de&s;truction; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed him, hugged, God ble&s;&s;ed, and half &s;mothered her heavenly infant, as &s;he truly called it,
<PB N="121" REF="122">
with ki&s;&s;es; nay &s;he ki&s;&s;ed me&mdash;in &s;pi|rit, Oliver&mdash;I could &s;ee &s;he did: ay and in &s;pirit I returned her cha&s;te ca|re&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>She entreated me with &s;o much hum|ble love and gratitude to come and &s;ee her poor hou&s;e, which I had &s;aved, and to tell her my name, that &s;he might pray for me the longe&s;t day &s;he had to live, that I could not forbear gratifying her &s;o far as to go with her. As for my name, I told her it was man. The quick hu&s;&s;ey under&s;tood me, for &s;he re|plied&mdash;No, it was angel.</P>
<P>I found her hou&s;e, like her per&s;on, neat, and in order. What is &s;till better, her Harry &s;eems a kind good young man, and alive to as well as de|&s;erving of her affection.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">
Would&s;t thou think it, Oliver?&mdash;The plea&s;ure I had communicated had re|verberated back upon my&s;elf; yet the fight of a couple thus happy gave birth to a thought of &s;uch exqui&s;ite pain that&mdash;! Something &s;hot acro&s;s my brain&mdash;I know not what&mdash;But it &s;eemed to indicate I &s;hould never be &s;o mated!</P>
<P>Still, this money, Oliver&mdash;Prithee be at the trouble to examine the que&s;tion, and &s;end me thy thoughts; for I have not been able to &s;atisfy my&s;elf. What is the thing called property? What are <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum?</HI> Under what circum|&s;tances may a man take money from an|other? I would not be proud; neither would I render my&s;elf de&s;picable.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t how I delight to impart my joys and griefs to thee. Thou telle&s;t me
<PB N="123" REF="124">
thou partake&s;t them; and, judging by my&s;elf, I cannot but believe thee. Tell me when thou art weary of me; I have long and often been weary of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he is very kind to me, and &s;o kind that I have lately been betrayed into hopes too flattering, too ec&s;tatic to be true. Oh! Should &s;he ever think of me! Were it only po&s;&s;ible &s;he ever &s;hould be mine!&mdash;The plea&s;ure is too exqui&s;ite! It is in&s;upportable!&mdash;Let me gaze and wonder at humble di&s;tance, in &s;ilence and in awe!&mdash;Do not call me abject&mdash;Yet, if I am &s;o, do; tell me all that ought to be told. It is not before her rank that I bend and &s;ink. Being for being I am her equal: but who is her equal in virtue?&mdash;Heavens! What a &s;mile did &s;he be&s;tow on me, when I
<PB N="124" REF="125">
took the money I mentioned to thee! It has &s;unken deep, deep in my heart! Ne|ver can it be forgotten! Never! Never!</P>

<P>MUST I be &s;ilent? Mu&s;t I not tell my Loui&s;a how infinitely her candor and ju&s;tice delight me? With the voice of a warning angel &s;he bids me enquire, examine my heart, and re&s;olve.

<P>My friend cautions me again&s;t being partial, even in favour of her bro|ther. Such a friend is indeed worthy to advi&s;e, and I will remember her pre|cepts. This brother may be a degene|rate &s;cion from a noble &s;tock: yet I can hardly think the thing po&s;&s;ible. That he may have fallen into many of the mi&s;|takes, common to the world in which he has lived, is indeed mo&s;t likely.

<P>What high proofs of courage, per&s;e|verance, and of &s;uffering, do men conti|nually give! And &s;hall we wholly re|nounce the dignity of emulation, and willingly &s;ign the unju&s;t decree of preju|dice, that mind likewi&s;e has its &s;ex, and
<PB N="128" REF="129">
that women are de&s;titute of energy and fortitude?</P>
<P>But Frank Henley!&mdash;Let me not hide a thought from my Loui&s;a. He is in|deed worthy of being loved, every day more worthy. I have a new &s;tory to tell, which will be more effectual prai&s;e than any words of mine. Like you I am per&s;uaded he has &s;ome affection for me. I am not in&s;en&s;ible to his worth and virtues: I ought not to be. Were I to indulge the reveries into which I could ea&s;ily fall, I might be as much mi&s;led by pa&s;&s;ion as others, who are &s;o ready to complain and pity them&s;elves for being in love. But a wakeful &s;en&s;e of the con&s;equences is my &s;afeguard. It cannot be. I &s;hould render my father,
<PB N="129" REF="130">
my relations, and friends, mi&s;erable. I &s;hould &s;et a bad example to my &s;ex. I, who aim at &s;hewing them mind is &s;upe|rior to &s;ex.</P>
<P>Such are the thoughts that protect me from the danger. His mental excellence perhaps I love as truly as heart could wi&s;h. But, as the lover who is to be the hu&s;band, no! I will not &s;uffer my thoughts to glance in that direction. I might, but I will not. Nothing but a conviction that my principles are wrong &s;hall ever make me; and that convic|tion I hold to be impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Do not imagine I am guilty of the mi&s;take of &s;uppo&s;ing my&s;elf his &s;uperior. Far the rever&s;e. The tale which I am now about to relate will inform you better of the true &s;tate of my feelings.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">
You mu&s;t know, my dear, that on our arrival in town, Sir Arthur, with my help, prevailed on Frank Henley to ac|cept a twenty pound bill, that he might have the means of gratifying his inclina|tions, and enjoying the plea&s;ures which at his age it is natural he &s;hould wi&s;h to enjoy. The&s;e means I had but too good rea&s;on to be convinced had been denied him by his father, which I &s;u&s;pected to be, and am now &s;atisfied was, the true rea&s;on that Frank refu&s;ed to attend us on our journey.</P>
<P>The youth has quite pride enough, my dear: he is de&s;irous to confer, but not to accept obligations; is ready enough to give, but not to receive. As if he had not only a right to monopolize virtue, but to be exempt from the wants
<PB N="131" REF="132">
which are common to all, and to &s;upply which men form them&s;elves into &s;oci|eties. He &s;eems to &s;hrink with exqui&s;ite pain from the acceptance of money. However I was determined to conquer, and conquer I did. Nor can I &s;ay, con|&s;idering them as I do, that I was &s;orry to offend the fal&s;e feelings even of Frank Henley, for whom I have an-infinite e&s;teem.</P>
<P>After receiving this pre&s;ent, he ac+companied me two or three times to tho&s;e public places to which crowns and half guineas gain admittance; and, as you may imagine, was far from appear|ing in&s;en&s;ible of the powers of poetry and mu&s;ic. Suddenly however he re|fu&s;ed to be any more of &s;uch parties, for which I own I could divine no rea&s;on.
<PB N="132" REF="133">
I knew he had been educated in habits of oeconomy, and therefore could not &s;uppo&s;e, generous though I knew him to be, that he had &s;quandered away his pocket-money in &s;o &s;hort a time. I en|deavoured both to rally and to rea&s;on, but in vain; he was po&s;itive even to ob|&s;tinacy; and I rightly conjectured there mu&s;t be &s;ome cau&s;e for it which I had not di&s;covered.</P>
<P>You have heard me &s;peak, I believe, my dear, of Mrs. Clarke, as of a careful good woman, and a great favourite with my dear mamma, when living. She was then our hou&s;ekeeper in the country, but has lately been left in the town hou&s;e; becau&s;e the furniture is too valuable to be entru&s;ted to a le&s;s at|tentive per&s;on. This Mrs. Clarke had a
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;i&s;ter who&s;e name was Webb, and who left a &s;on and a daughter, who are both married. The &s;on, as you will &s;oon hear, has been a wild and gracele&s;s fellow; but the daughter is one of the mo&s;t agreeable and engaging young creatures I think I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday my good Mrs. Clarke and her niece were &s;hut up together in clo&s;e conver&s;ation for a con&s;iderable time; and I perceived that their cheeks were &s;welled, their eyes red, and that they had been crying violently. I almo&s;t re|vere Mrs. Clarke as my mother, be|cau&s;e of the excellence of her heart and the &s;oundne&s;s of her under&s;tanding. I therefore could not forbear earne&s;tly enquiring whether it were po&s;&s;ible for me to remove her cau&s;e of grief; for
<PB N="134" REF="135">
grieved, I told her, I could plainly per|ceive &s;he was. She bur&s;t into tears again on my que&s;tioning her, and endeavoured to expre&s;s feelings that were too big for utterance. Turning to her niece &s;he &s;aid&mdash;<Q>I mu&s;t inform my dear young lady.</Q> <Q>For God's &s;ake don't! For the Lord's &s;ake don't!</Q> cried the ter|rified creature. <Q>I mu&s;t,</Q> replied the aunt. <Q>It is proper.</Q> <Q>He will have no mercy &s;hewn him! He will be hanged!</Q> exclaimed the other, in an agony. <Q>You do not know this lady,</Q> &s;aid the aunt. <Q>Indeed &s;he does not,</Q> added I, <Q>if &s;he &s;uppo&s;es I would have any creature upon earth hanged.</Q> <Q>Retire, Peggy,</Q> &s;aid the aunt, <Q>while I relate the vile, the dreadful tale.</Q> <Q>No, no! For mercy's &s;ake no!</Q> re|plied
<PB N="135" REF="136">
the niece. <Q>I mu&s;t &s;tay, and beg, and pray, and down on my knees for my brother! He is a wild and a wicked young man, but he is my brother.</Q> <Q>Pray let her &s;tay,</Q> &s;aid I to the aunt. <Q>And fear nothing, my kind|hearted Peggy. Be a&s;&s;ured I will not hurt a hair of your brother's head. I will do him good if I can, but no injury.</Q> <Q>The God of Heaven ble&s;s and reward your angelic lady&s;hip!</Q> cried the half frantic grateful Peggy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Clarke attempted to begin her &s;tory. She was almo&s;t &s;uffocated. I never heard &s;o heart-rending a groan as &s;he gave, when &s;he came to the fatal &s;en|tence! Would you believe it, Loui&s;a? This nephew of the worthy Mrs. Clarke, this brother of the good Peggy, is the
<PB N="136" REF="137">
very highwayman who &s;hot Frank Hen|ley!</P>
<P>His benevolent aunt has been with him, for he is &s;till under the &s;urgeon's hands; and he has confe&s;&s;ed to her [I am angry with my&s;elf, Loui&s;a, to find I wonder at it] he has confe&s;&s;ed that the brave, the humane, the noble-minded Frank has vi&s;ited him &s;everal times, and has &s;et the folly of his wicked pur&s;uits in &s;o true and &s;o &s;trong a light, that the man prote&s;ts, with the utmo&s;t vehe|mence, if he can but e&s;cape puni&s;hment for the faults he has committed, he will &s;ooner peri&s;h than again be guilty of his former crimes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time Frank vi&s;ited him he gave the poor wretch a guinea; and went him&s;elf in &s;earch of another lodg|ing
<PB N="137" REF="138">
for him, as well to remove him from the knowledge of his wicked compa|nions as to protect him from the forty pound hunters. The man wants to e&s;cape over to the continent; and ap|pears to be &s;o &s;incere, in his re&s;olves of reformation, that Frank has undertaken to furni&s;h him with the means.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, Loui&s;a, the heart-felt prai&s;es which the worthy Mrs. Clarke be&s;towed on the youth. And Peggy &s;aid that &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould &s;ome time or another live to &s;ee him, that &s;he might fall down and ki&s;s his foot&s;teps! But, added &s;he, with great ardor, I find indeed there are very good men in the world!</P>
<P>Still there appeared &s;omething enig|matical to me, between Frank and the
<PB N="138" REF="139">
money account. I could not conceive how he &s;hould want the means imme|diately to furni&s;h &s;uch a &s;um as would have been &s;ufficient for the poor fugi|tive. And this again reminded me how a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly Frank had lately avoided every occa&s;ion of expence.</P>
<P>While we were in the mid&s;t of our di&s;cour&s;e, who &s;hould enter the room but Frank! Never was I pre&s;ent at &s;uch a &s;cene!&mdash;<Q>Good God Almighty!</Q> exclaimed Peggy, the moment &s;he &s;aw him. <Q>This is he! This is the very ble&s;&s;ed, dear gentleman, that &s;aved my poor Harry from tho&s;e terrible jailors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Is it po&s;&s;ible?</Q> cried Mrs. Clarke.</P>
<P><Q>It is, it is he! He him&s;elf!</Q> &s;aid the full-hearted Peggy, falling down on her knees, and catching the flap of his
<PB N="139" REF="140">
coat, which &s;he ki&s;&s;ed with inconceivable enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Poor Frank did not know which way to look. Good deeds are &s;o uncommon, and &s;o much the cau&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e, that virtue blu&s;hes at being detected almo&s;t as deeply as vice. I knew Frank had a noble heart; and I own, Loui&s;a, I was not much amazed when Peggy, with abundance of kind expre&s;&s;ions and a flow of &s;imple eloquence, related the manner in which Frank had &s;aved her hu&s;band from the bailiffs, by paying a debt which with co&s;ts amounted to up|ward of eighteen pounds.</P>
<P>I did not however forbear &s;everely to reprove my&s;elf, for having dared &s;o much as to imagine that a youth with
<PB N="140" REF="141">
&s;uch high virtues could not, in a city like London, find opportunities of ex|pending &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as twenty pounds in acts of benevolence. I ought at lea&s;t to have &s;uppo&s;ed the thing probable; yet it never once entered my mind.</P>
<P>The thanks, ble&s;&s;ings, and prayers of Peggy were endle&s;s. Finding him not only to be what &s;he knew, the man who relieved her from the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s, but likewi&s;e the vanqui&s;her and the &s;aviour of her brother, &s;he &s;aid and prote&s;ted &s;he was &s;ure there was not &s;uch another angel upon earth! She was &s;ure there was not! Frank was a&s;hamed of and almo&s;t offended at her ince&s;&s;ant prai&s;e. It was &s;o natural and &s;o proper for him to act as he did, that
<PB N="141" REF="142">
he is &s;urpri&s;ed to find it can be matter of wonder.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t however upon &s;eeing him reimbur&s;ed; and I per&s;uade my&s;elf there is one thought which will make him &s;ubmit to it quietly. I have but to remind him that the good of others requires that men, who &s;o well know the u&s;e of it, &s;hould never be without money</P>
<P>Adieu. I have not time to write more at pre&s;ent.&mdash;Yet I mu&s;t, for I ought to add, that, though I thought my&s;elf &s;o fully convinced when I began this letter, concerning Frank and the only right mode of acting, doubts have &s;everal times intruded them&s;elves upon me, while I have been writing. I will

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor-Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is an intolerably &s;trange thing, Oliver, that a man cannot perform the mere nece&s;&s;ary duties of humanity, with|out being &s;uppo&s;ed almo&s;t a prodigy. Where is the common &s;en&s;e, I will not &s;ay delicacy, which &s;hould teach people that &s;uch &s;uppo&s;itions are an in&s;ult, not only to the per&s;on but to all mankind?
<PB N="144" REF="145">
I am young, I grant, and know but little of the barbarity which it is pre|tended is univer&s;al. I cannot think the accu&s;ation true. Or, if it be, I am con|vinced it mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of&punc; &s;ome &s;trange perver&s;ion of what may be called the natural propen&s;ities of man. I own I have &s;een children wrangle for and endeavour to purloin, or &s;eize by force, each others apples and cherries; and this may be a beginning to future rapacity. But I know the obvious cour&s;e of nature would be to correct, in&s;tead of to confirm, &s;uch mi&s;takes. I know too that there are individual in&s;tances of cruelty, and in&s;en&s;ibility. But the&s;e &s;urely are the exceptions, and not the rule.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited a man who&s;e vices, that is
<PB N="145" REF="146">
who&s;e errors and pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o violent as to be dangerous to &s;ociety, and &s;till more dangerous to him&s;elf. Was it not my duty? I thought my&s;elf certain of convincing him of his folly, and of bringing back a lo&s;t individual to the paths of utility and good &s;en&s;e. What &s;hould I have been, had I neglected &s;uch an opportunity? I have really no patience to think that a thing, which it would have been a crime to have left undone, &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed a work of &s;upererogation!</P>
<P>I &s;aw an indu&s;trious ri&s;ing family on the brink of ruin, and in the agonies of de&s;pair, which were the con&s;equences of an act of virtue; and I was not &s;elfi&s;h enough to prefer my own whims, which I might choo&s;e to call plea&s;ures, to the
<PB N="146" REF="147">
pre&s;ervation of this worthy, this really excellent little family. And for this I am to be adored! For no word is &s;trong enough to expre&s;s the fooleries that have been acted to me. They were well meant? True. They were the ebulli|tions of virtue? I do not deny it. But either they are an unju&s;t &s;atire upon the world in general, or it is a vile world. I half &s;u&s;pect, indeed, it is not quite what it ought to be.</P>
<P>In addition to all this, I have been obliged to receive a &s;um equal to that which I thought it my duty to be&s;tow. This is the &s;econd time; and perhaps thou wilt tell me I am not difficult to per&s;uade. Read the following dialogue, which pa&s;&s;ed between me and the mo&s;t angelic of Heaven's creatures, and judge
<PB N="147" REF="148">
for thy&s;elf. She is really a prodigy! I never knew another mind of &s;uch un|common powers! So clear, &s;o collected, &s;o certain of choo&s;ing the &s;ide of truth, and &s;o &s;ecure of victory!</P>
<P>I am an a&s;s! I am talking Arabic to thee. I ought to have begun with in|forming thee of a circum&s;tance which is in it&s;elf odd enough. The highwayman and Peggy. [P&s;haw! The woman who&s;e hu&s;band was arre&s;ted.] They are not only brother and &s;i&s;ter, but the nephew and niece of Mrs. Clarke. Think of that, Oliver! The nephew of &s;o worthy a woman &s;o audaciou&s;ly wicked! Well might the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Peggy expre&s;s anger which I could perceive was heartfelt, though &s;he her&s;elf at that time knew not of this act. But to my dialogue. Li&s;ten to
<PB N="148" REF="149">
the voice of my charmer, and &s;ay whe|ther &s;he charm not wi&s;ely!</P>
<P>You have made a generous and a noble u&s;e, Frank, of the &s;mall &s;um which you were &s;o very unwilling to accept&punc; [She treats me with the mo&s;t winning familiarity! What does &s;he mean? Is it purpo&s;ely to &s;hew me how much &s;he is at her ea&s;e with me; and how impo&s;&s;ible it is that any thing but civility &s;hould exi&s;t between us? Or is it truly as kind as it &s;eems? Can it be? Who can &s;ay? Is it out of nature? Wholly? Surely, &s;urely not. The&s;e bur&s;ting gleams of hope beget &s;u&s;pen&s;e more intolerable than all the blackne&s;s of de&s;pair it&s;elf.]</P>
<P>I acted naturally, madam; and I con|fe&s;s it gives me &s;ome pain to find it the &s;ubject of &s;o much wonder.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
It is no &s;ubject of wonder to me. Your inferiors in under&s;tanding I know would not act like you; but the weak do not give law to the &s;trong. I own that I have been dull enough, unju&s;t enough, not to &s;u&s;pect your true motive for refu&s;ing, as you have done lately, to accompany us to public places. But this is a heavy penalty on you which an act of virtue ought not to incur.</P>
<P>If it be a penalty, madam, I am &s;ure it is one which you have too much ge|nero&s;ity to wi&s;h to deprive me of the plea&s;ure of paying.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand your hint: but I am not &s;o generous as you think me; for I am determined, and you know what a po&s;i|tive girl I am, to &s;hare both the penalty and the enjoyment with you.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">
I beg your pardon, madam, but that cannot be.</P>
<P>Oh! But, in &s;pite of your &s;erious and very emphatical air, it mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, madam. I am certain you have too high a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice to impo&s;e&punc;laws to which you your&s;elf would not &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Very true. Prove me that and I am an&s;wered. Nay, &s;o confident am I of the goodne&s;s of my cau&s;e, that I will not require you to take up this [Laying down another bank note, of equal value with the former.] unle&s;s I can on the con|trary prove it to be nothing but fal&s;e pride, or mi&s;take, which can induce you to refu&s;e. You perceive, Frank, I am not afraid of offending you by &s;peaking the plain truth. Pray tell me, when
<PB N="151" REF="152">
you &s;aw the worthy couple whom you relieved in di&s;tre&s;s, had you per&s;i&s;ted in your refu&s;al of the paltry bit of paper which I before prevailed on you to re|ceive, what would you have &s;aid to your|&s;elf, what would have been your re|mor&s;e, when you found your&s;elf unable to &s;uccour the unfortunate, merely be|cau&s;e you had been too proud to receive that which you wanted, and which there|fore you had no right to refu&s;e. [You &s;ee, Oliver, &s;he &s;natched my own &s;word from my &s;ide, with which to di&s;patch me. If thou art too dull to under&s;tand me, con&s;ult my la&s;t letter.] You were ready to protect, thought at the ri&s;k of your life, tho&s;e very per&s;ons at who&s;e favours, as they are fal&s;ely called, your &s;pirit is &s;o equally ready to revolt. Per|haps
<PB N="152" REF="153">
in defending us you did no more than you ought; but we cannot be ig|norant how few are capable of doing &s;o much. And, &s;ince you are thus prompt to perform all which the mo&s;t au&s;tere morality can require, &s;o long as it &s;hall be apparent to the world that your mo|tives are not &s;elfi&s;h, proceed a &s;tep fur|ther; di&s;regard the world, and every being in it; that is, di&s;regard their mi&s;|takes; and, &s;atisfied that your motives are pure, defy the fal&s;e interpretations to which any right action may &s;ubject you. Neither, while you are actually di&s;charg|ing the highe&s;t offices of humanity, deny to others the right to fulfil &s;ome of the mo&s;t trivial.</P>
<P>I could not act otherwi&s;e than I did, on both the occa&s;ions to which you al|lude,
<PB N="153" REF="154">
madam. I believe it is our duty always to be guided by circum&s;tances; but not to be guilty of an impropriety, becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible &s;uch circum&s;tances may again occur.</P>
<P>You are right. We only differ con|cerning the meaning of the word. Im|propriety, or propriety, we &s;hall come to pre&s;ently. You have promi&s;ed your wounded penitent money, to facilitate his e&s;cape, and you have none.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome trifling u&s;ele&s;s property, madam.</P>
<P>But you have a journey to make back to Wenbourne-Hill, according to your pre&s;ent intentions.</P>
<P>Do you imagine, madam, I cannot fa&s;t for a day?</P>
<P>Oh yes! I doubt it not; for a week,
<PB N="154" REF="155">
Frank, to effect any great, any laudable purpo&s;e. But I mu&s;t be plain with you. It is ungenerous of you to wi&s;h to engro&s;s all virtue and &s;en&s;ibility. Be&s;ide, you have duties to perform to your&s;elf, which are as pre&s;&s;ing as any you owe to &s;ociety, becau&s;e they are to fit you for the &s;ocial duties. [Hearken to the angel, Oli|ver!] It is as much my duty, at pre|fent, to afford you the means which you want, as it was yours to vi&s;it the wound|ed highwayman, or aid the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Peggy. You ought to &s;uffer me to per|form my duties, both for my &s;ake and your own. You ought not to neglect, while you are in London, to &s;eize on every opportunity which can tend to en|large your faculties. You have no com|mon part to act; and, that you may act
<PB N="155" REF="156">
it well, you &s;hould &s;tudy the beings with whom you are to a&s;&s;ociate. You mu&s;t not &s;uffer any fal&s;e feelings to unfit you for the high offices for the execution of which men like you are formed. [Did&s;t thou ever hear &s;uch honeyed flattery, Oli|ver?] Something more&mdash;You mu&s;t ac|company us to France.</P>
<P>Madam!&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Hear me, Frank. The journey will be of infinite &s;ervice to you. A mind like yours cannot vi&s;it a kingdom where the manners of the people are &s;o di&s;tinct as tho&s;e of the French mu&s;t be from the Engli&s;h, without receiving great benefit. Your father is rich.</P>
<P>That he denies, madam.</P>
<P>To you; and you and I know why. If your delicacy &s;hould object to a gift, I
<PB N="156" REF="157">
am &s;ure it cannot with propriety to a loan. Going with us, your expences will in fact be only ca&s;ual. I can &s;upply you with &s;uch money as you want, which you may hereafter repay me, when I may perhaps be glad that I have &s;uch a debtor.</P>
<P>My father's property, madam, is of his own acquiring; I have no legal claim upon it; and it would be di&s;ho|ne&s;t in me to &s;pend that, upon &s;pecula|tion, which perhaps never may be mine.</P>
<P>Yes; to &s;pend it in unworthy pur|po&s;es would be di&s;hone&s;t. But I again recur to your duties. However, &s;ince you are &s;o tenacious on the &s;ubject, I will become a u&s;urer to pacify your feel|ings, and you &s;hall pay for ri&s;k. Fifty pounds, unle&s;s you meet with more Peg|gies,

I dare &s;ay will bear you free. [It is twenty pounds more, thou knowe&s;t, than I a&s;ked of my father.] You &s;hall give me eighty whenever you have a thou&s;and pounds of your own.</P>

<P>Why &s;hould I de&s;pair?&mdash;With a modern mi&s;s, a fine lady, I might; but not with her. She has a mind &s;uperior to the world, and its mi&s;takes. And am I not convinced there ought to be no impediment to our union? Why &s;hould I doubt of convincing her?

Not to de|&s;ert my own cau&s;e, if it be a ju&s;t one:
<PB N="161" REF="162">
and, if it be the contrary, there is no que&s;tion: I will make none. Let me but be convinced of my error, and it &s;hall be renounced. Yes, Oliver, I dare boldly aver&mdash;it &s;hall!

Why with inward whi&s;|pers do I murmur thoughts which I dare not &s;peak aloud? Why do they ri&s;e qui|vering to my lips, and there panting ex|pire, painfully &s;truggling for birth, but in vain? Oh! How poorly do I paint what &s;o oppre&s;&s;ively I feel!</P>
<P>I would have thee read my whole heart. I &s;hudder to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be a &s;educer. Fal&s;ely to be thought &s;o would trouble me but little.
<PB N="162" REF="163">
But tamely to yield up felicity &s;o ine&s;ti|mable, in compliance with the errors of mankind to renounce a union which might and ought to be productive of &s;o much good, is not this a crime?&mdash;Speak without fear. Shew me what is right. Convince me, then blame me if I quail.</P>
<P>And now, Oliver, it is probable thou wilt not &s;ee me for the&s;e three months. Delicate as the&s;e money favours are be|come in the tran&s;actions of men, con|temptible as they often are in them|&s;elves, and unwilling as I have been to &s;ubject my&s;elf to them, I am glad that &s;he has conquered. I would not have he&s;itated a moment; for obliga|tion, if obligation it were, to her would be heaven: but &s;he has her own wants,
<PB N="163" REF="164">
her own mode of doing good. The&s;e I was very de&s;irous not to abridge. But, &s;ince I mu&s;t either comply or remain be|hind, I am glad to have been &s;o honour|ably vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>My father, I know, is willing enough I &s;hould go to France, or where I plea&s;e, &s;o that I do not a&s;k him for money. In|deed he told me as much. He thinks it matters not what becomes of a fellow &s;o u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;o idle, as he &s;uppo&s;es me to be. However I have written to inform him of my intention, and once more to remind him, though certainly in vain, of the manner in which he ought to act.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>London, Gro&s;venor-Street.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had a &s;trong conte&s;t, my dear, with our favourite youth, to over|come what I believe I have convinced him is prejudice; and I hope he is cured of fal&s;e delicacy, for the future. He is to go with us to France, and is no longer under the nece&s;&s;ity of ab&s;taining from
<PB N="167" REF="168">
innocent and in&s;tructive amu&s;ements, becau&s;e he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;ibility and a high re&s;pect for virtue.</P>
<P>But he had no &s;ooner accepted this &s;upply than away he was gone to his convert. This I &s;u&s;pected. For which rea&s;on I had previou&s;ly di&s;patched Mrs. Clarke to vi&s;it her nephew. The good woman could not be prevailed on to re|ceive any money for his relief; urging that &s;he was very capable of &s;upplying him her&s;elf. That being &s;o, I did not choo&s;e violently to conte&s;t the matter with her; as I do not wi&s;h to encourage the mo&s;t di&s;tant approaches to a &s;pirit of avarice. I only told her it would be un|ju&s;t &s;hould &s;he ever want money, for u&s;eful and virtuous purpo&s;es, if &s;he did not apply to me: and &s;he with much
<PB N="168" REF="169">
good &s;en&s;e an&s;wered &s;he thought as I did, and would certainly act accordingly. She is a very worthy woman.</P>
<P>She was with her nephew when Frank came in; and the &s;cene, as de&s;cribed by her, was affecting. The poor culprit had been repeating all his obligations to the generous Frank, prai&s;ing his bravery, and dwelling, with a degree of convic|tion which gave Mrs. Clarke great plea|&s;ure, on the effects of goodne&s;s; &s;ince it could render a man &s;o undaunted, &s;o forgiving, &s;o humane, and &s;o much as he &s;aid like a &s;aint. You know, my dear, that &s;aint, in the language of &s;uch p&egrave;ople, does not mean an impo&s;tor, who pretends to carry burning coals in his hands, drive ru&s;ty nails into his legs, adore a mor&s;el of rotten wood, or de|cayed
<PB N="169" REF="170">
bone, and pretend to work mira|cles, or preach exclu&s;ive doctrines of faith and &s;alvation. A &s;aint with them is a per&s;on more perfect, in the di&s;charge of the highe&s;t moral duties, than they believe any other earthly being to be. Let us accept their definition, and enroll the name of Frank Henley in our ca|lendar.</P>
<P>Frank was di&s;appointed, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;plea&s;ed, that any per&s;on &s;hould offer his reformed friend, as from the be&s;t of motives he called him, mo|ney but him&s;elf; and the rea&s;on he gave was not without its force. This is a me|morable epocha in the life of a mi&s;taken man, &s;aid he; and no means, which can move his mind to a better performance of his duties than he has hitherto at|tempted,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;hould be left untried. It is but natural that he &s;hould think more of me than of mo&s;t other per&s;ons: [<Q>I can think of no one el&s;e!</Q> Exclaimed the poor fellow, with enthu&s;ia&s;m.] and, the more cau&s;e he &s;hall have to remember me with affection, the more weight will the rea&s;ons have with him which I have urged.</P>
<P>The culprit acknowledged that, from ill advice, vicious example, and violent pa&s;&s;ions, he had become very wicked. But, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t be wicked indeed if I could ever forget what this gentleman has &s;aid, and done, to &s;ave my family from &s;hame and ruin, and me from de|&s;truction and death.</P>
<P>There is the greater rea&s;on to hope, becau&s;e Mrs. Clarke &s;ays that he has
<PB N="171" REF="172">
been what is called well educated, his &s;tation in life con&s;idered: and indeed of this I imagine &s;he her&s;elf had taken care.</P>
<P>Peggy came in, and by her exce&s;s of gratitude, and which is better of admira|tion for her hero, &s;he drove the over de|licate Frank away. This is one of his defects, for which we mu&s;t endeavour to find a remedy. Men are not expo&s;ed to the ful&s;ome prai&s;e which we unmarried females are calmly obliged to hear, or be continually at war; or Frank would be more patient. Indeed he ought to be; becau&s;e, in this in&s;tance, the prai&s;es he receives are the effu&s;ions of per&s;ons who had never before &s;een virtue exert her|&s;elf with &s;o much ardour.</P>
<P>Though the nephew be not an old or
<PB N="172" REF="173">
hardened offender, he has committed &s;ome depredations of the con&s;equences of which, were they proved upon him, he him&s;elf is ignorant. His accomplice has di&s;covered his retreat; another more private lodging has therefore been taken for him, to which he is to remove with all po&s;&s;ible caution. And when he is &s;ufficiently recovered, which Mrs. Clarke tells me will be &s;oon, he is then to de|part for the continent and work at his trade, which is that of a cabinet-maker. Engli&s;h workmen are in high e&s;teem abroad, and he will ea&s;ily find employ|ment. He is more than reconciled to labour, he is eager to begin; and, as it appears, does not want activity of mind; of which the dangerous expedients to which he re&s;orted are &s;ome proof.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
So much for the hi&s;tory of a highway|man; which I think is at lea&s;t as de|&s;erving of remembrance as that of many other depredators.</P>
<P>I have been making &s;ome efforts to decide the que&s;tion, not of love, but, of duty. Love mu&s;t not be permitted, till duty &s;hall be known. I have not &s;ati&s;|fied my&s;elf &s;o well as I could wi&s;h, yet my former rea&s;ons &s;eem invincible. Ought my father and my family to be offended? Ought I to &s;et an example that might be pernicious? Is it mo&s;t probable that by oppo&s;ing I &s;hould cor|rect or increa&s;e the world's mi&s;takes? The path before me is direct and plain; ought I to deviate?</P>
<P>In vain I fear &s;hould I plead his extra|ordinary
<PB N="174" REF="175">
merit. Would the plea re|move the load of affliction with which I &s;hould overwhelm tho&s;e who love me be&s;t? At pre&s;ent they think well, nay highly of me. I &s;ometimes have the power to influence them to good. What power &s;hall I have when they imagine I have di&s;graced both my&s;elf and them?</P>
<P>Who ever &s;aw tho&s;e treated with e&s;teem who are them&s;elves &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;laves of pa&s;&s;ion? And could the world po&s;&s;ibly be per&s;uaded that a marriage between me and the &s;on of my father's &s;teward could ever origi|nate, on my part, in honourable mo|tives?</P>
<P>Ought I to forget the influence of example? Where is the young lady,
<PB N="175" REF="176">
being de&s;irous to marry an adventurer, or one who&s;e mind might be as mean as his origin, who would not &s;uppo&s;e her favourite more than the equal of Frank? For is not the power of di&s;crimination lo&s;t, when the pa&s;&s;ions are indulged? And ought my name to be cited? Ought they to be encouraged by any act of mine?</P>
<P>Yet the oppo&s;ing arguments are far from feeble. His feelings are too &s;trong to be concealed. Perhaps the only weakne&s;s I can think him capable of is that of loving me. For if love be contra|dictory to rea&s;on, it is a weakne&s;s; but &s;hould he an&s;wer that love and rea&s;on are inthis in&s;tance united, we mu&s;t come to proofs. That he loves is too vi&s;ible to admit of doubt. I have &s;een the word
<PB N="176" REF="177">
trembling as it were on his tongue. I am almo&s;t certain that a &s;illy thing which I &s;aid, with a very different in|tention, would have produced an avowal of his pa&s;&s;ion, had I not added &s;omething to prevent it, and hurried away.</P>
<P>Well then! Am I certain I am guilty of no inju&s;tice to him? And why ought I not to be as ju&s;t to him as to any other being on earth? Who would be more ju&s;t to me? Who would be more ten|der, more faithful, more affectionate?</P>
<P>I know not whether I ought to &s;hrink from the vanity which &s;eems annexed to the idea, for I know not whether it be va|nity, but I cannot &s;ometimes help a&s;k|ing my&s;elf whether the good that might re&s;ult from the union of two &s;trong minds, mutually determined to exert
<PB N="177" REF="178">
their powers for the welfare of &s;ociety, be not a rea&s;on &s;uperior even to all tho&s;e I have enumerated.</P>
<P>If this be &s;o, and if our minds really po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;trength which I am &s;o ready to &s;uppo&s;e, I then know not what an|&s;wer to give. I reject the affectation of under e&s;timating my&s;elf, purpo&s;ely that I may be called a mode&s;t humble young lady. Humility I am per&s;uaded, though not &s;o common, is as much a vice as pride. But, while avoiding one ex|treme, I mu&s;t take care not to be guilty of another. The que&s;tion is embarra&s;|&s;ing; but I mu&s;t not by delay &s;uffer embarra&s;&s;ment to increa&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to your brother, I can at pre&s;ent conclude nothing, and can con|jecture but little. The idea which has
<PB N="178" REF="179">
oftene&s;t occurred, and which I have be|fore mentioned, is the infinite plea&s;ure of &s;eeing an active mind in the full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of its powers; and of being in&s;tru|mental in re&s;toring that which mi&s;take may have injured, or in part de&s;troyed. It &s;eems a duty pointed out to me; at|tended perhaps with difficulty, and it may be with danger; but the&s;e increa&s;e its force. And if &s;o, here is another ar|gument to add to the heavie&s;t &s;cale.</P>
<P>Yes. It mu&s;t be thus. The more I examine, and while I am writing per|haps I examine the be&s;t, the more I am confirmed in my former deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Pity for Frank ought not to be li&s;ten|ed to. It is always a fal&s;e motive, un|le&s;s &s;upported by ju&s;tice. Frank will never conde&s;cend to endeavour to incite
<PB N="179" REF="180">
compa&s;&s;ion; it is not in his character. He will rather a&s;&s;ert his claims, for &s;o he ought. I do not mean that a com|plaint will never e&s;cape him. The be&s;t of us are not always &s;o perfectly ma&s;ter of our thoughts as never to be incon|&s;i&s;tent. But his &s;y&s;tem will not be to win that by interce&s;&s;ion which he could not obtain by fair and honourable bar|ter. The moment I have entirely &s;ati&s;|fied and convinced my&s;elf, I have no doubt of inducing him to behave as no|bly on this as he has done on every other trying occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Loui&s;a, for the pre|&s;ent farewel. I do not &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall write again, except a line to inform you of our &s;afe arrival after having cro&s;&s;ed the chan|nel, till we come to Paris. I expect to
<PB N="180" REF="181">
be amu&s;ed by the journey. Though I cannot but own I think that, as far as amu&s;ement was concerned, the good ladies under the reign of the Tudors, who travelled twenty miles a day, on a &s;trong hor&s;e and a pillion, that is when &s;ummer made the roads pa&s;&s;able, had much better opportunities for ob&s;erva|tion than we, who, &s;hut up in our car|riages, with blinds to keep out the du&s;t, gallop further in two days and two nights than they could do in a month. This ha&s;ty travelling, when ha&s;te is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, is a great convenience. But nothing, except the inordinate ardour of the mind to enjoy, could induce peo|ple on a journey of plea&s;ure to hurry, as they do, through villages, towns, and counties, pa&s;s unnoticed the mo&s;t mag|nificent
<PB N="181" REF="182">
buildings, and the mo&s;t de|lightful pro&s;pects that fore&s;ts, rivers, and mountains can afford, and wilfully exclude them&s;elves from all the riches of nature. To look about us, while thus &s;urrounded, &s;eems to be a very natural wi&s;h. And if &s;o, a portable clo&s;et, or rather a flying watch-box, is but a blundering contrivance.</P>
<P>You know your Anna: her bu&s;y brain will be meddling. And perhaps &s;he tru&s;ts too much to the pardoning af|fection of friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>THAT I may not appear to neglect any filial duty, all of which it has been my mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h to fulfil, I write to inform you that, at the reque&s;t of the family, I am preparing to accompany Sir Arthur to France. From our la&s;t conver&s;ation I under&s;tood you had no
<PB N="183" REF="184">
objection to the journey, except that of furni&s;hing me with money; for it was your plea&s;ure to remind me that a man &s;o idle, as you &s;uppo&s;e I am, may be or go any where, without the world &s;uf|fering the lea&s;t lo&s;s. I own, did I imagine the &s;ame of my&s;elf, it would make me wretched indeed.</P>
<P>You thought proper, &s;ir, to refu&s;e me the &s;mall &s;um which I reque&s;ted of you for this purpo&s;e. I do not wi&s;h to wre&s;t what you are unwilling to give. You under&s;tand your own rea&s;onings be&s;t; but to me they appear to be either erroneous or incomprehen&s;ible. I wi&s;hed to explain to you what my plan of life was, but you refu&s;ed to hear me. I had no &s;ooner &s;aid that
<PB N="184" REF="185">
I thought it my duty to &s;tudy how I could be&s;t &s;erve &s;ociety, than you angrily told me I ought fir&s;t to think how I could be&s;t &s;erve my&s;elf. From a recollection of the pa&s;t, I am con|vinced this is a point on which we &s;hall never have the &s;ame opinion. For this I am &s;incerely &s;orry, but as I hope not to blame.</P>
<P>Suffer me however once more to repeat, &s;ir, that though my young lady has kindly offered to furni&s;h me with money, I &s;till think it wrong that you &s;hould permit me to accept her offer; having as I am well convinced the means to &s;upply me liberally your&s;elf. I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, I would forbear to go, or to lay my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="185" REF="186">
of a&s;king you for money, were I not fully per&s;uaded of its propriety. In order to perform my duty in the world, I ought to under&s;tand its inhabitants, its manners, and principally its laws, with the effects which the different legi&s;lation of different countries has produced. I believe this to be the highe&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful kind of know|ledge.</P>
<P>Could I fortunately induce you to think as I do, you certainly would not refu&s;e my reque&s;t. Thirty pounds to you would be but a trifle. But from my late failure I have &s;o little hope, that I rather write to execute a duty, than with any expectation of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE HONOURABLE MRS. CLIFTON TO HER SON, COKE CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Ro&s;e-Bank.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DIRECT this letter to you, my dear &s;on, at Paris; where it will either find you, or lie at the banker's till your ar|rival. A packet accompanies it, which contains the accounts of your late uncle with Mon&s;ieur de Chateauneuf; by which it appears there is a con&s;iderable balance
<PB N="197" REF="202">
in his favour, which as you know by will devolves to me.</P>
<P>I hope, when you have &s;ettled this bu&s;ine&s;s, you will be di&s;po&s;ed to return to England; and that I &s;hall once again have the happine&s;s to &s;ee you before I die. Do not imagine I &s;peak of death to attract any fal&s;e pity. But my &s;tate of health obliges me to con&s;ider this &s;e|rious event as at no great di&s;tance; though I do not think my&s;elf in imme|diate danger.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur St. Ives and his lovely daughter will &s;oon be in Paris. They reque&s;ted letters from me; and, among others, I thought I could not recom|mend them to any one with more pro|priety than to my &s;on. There is an in|timacy between our families at pre&s;ent;
<PB N="198" REF="203">
which was fir&s;t occa&s;ioned by an affec|tion which your &s;i&s;ter Loui&s;a and Anna St. Ives conceived for each other, and which has continually increa&s;ed, very much indeed to my &s;atisfaction. For, before I &s;aw this young lady, I never met with one whom I thought de&s;erving of the friend&s;hip of your &s;i&s;ter, Loui&s;a; who&s;e &s;trength of mind, if I do not mi&s;|take, is very extraordinary for her years. Yet even I, her mother, and liable enough to be partial, have &s;ometimes thought &s;he mu&s;t cede the palm to her friend, the charming Anna.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on for writing thus is that you may be guilty of no mi&s;takes of charac|ter, which indeed I think is very un|likely, and that you will &s;hew Sir Arthur all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect, as well as his daugh|ter,
<PB N="199" REF="204">
in ju&s;tice to your&s;elf, and as the friends of the family. Your &s;i&s;ter writes under the &s;ame cover; and I cannot doubt, whenever you read her letters, but that you mu&s;t receive very great &s;atis|faction, to find you have &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;carcely need tell you, Clifton, that though you have re&s;ided but little with me, I feel all the fond affection of a pa|rent; that I am earne&s;tly de&s;irous to hear of your happine&s;s, and to promote it; and that no plea&s;ure which the world could afford to me, per&s;onally, would equal that of &s;eeing you become a good and great man. You have &s;tudied; you have travelled; you have read both men and books; every advantage which the mo&s;t anxious de&s;ire to form your mind could-procure has been yours. I
<PB N="200" REF="205">
own that a mother's fondne&s;s forms great expectations of you; which, when you read this, be your faculties &s;trong or weak, you will very probably &s;ay you are capable of more than fulfilling. The feeble, hearing their worth or talents que&s;tioned, are too apt to &s;well and a&s;|&s;ume; and I have heard it &s;aid that the &s;trong are too intimately acquainted with them&s;elves to harbour doubt. I believe it ought to be &s;o. I believe it to be better that we &s;hould act boldly, and bring full conviction upon our&s;elves when mi&s;|taken, than that a timid &s;pirit &s;hould render us too cautious to do either good or harm. I would not preach; neither indeed at pre&s;ent could I. A thou&s;and ideas &s;eemed crowding upon my mind; but they have expelled each other as
<PB N="201" REF="206">
quickly as they came, and I &s;carcely know what to add. My head-achs di&s;|qualify me for long or con&s;i&s;tent think|ing; and nothing I believe but habit keeps me from being half an idiot.</P>
<P>One thing however I cannot forget; which is, that I am your mother, Clif|ton; and that I have the mo&s;t ardent and unremitting de&s;ire to &s;ee you a vir|tuous and a happy man. In which hope my ble&s;&s;ing and love are mo&s;t &s;incerely yours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LOUISA CLIFTON TO HER BROTHER, COKE CLIFTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Ro&s;e-Bank.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is long, my dear brother, &s;ince I re|ceived a letter from you; and &s;till longer &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee you. How many rivers, &s;eas, valleys, and moun|tains have you traver&s;ed, &s;ince that time! What various nations, what numerous oppo&s;ite and characteri&s;tic countenances
<PB N="203" REF="208">
have you beheld! From all and each of them I hope you have learned &s;ome|thing. I hope the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects has not been &s;o quick as to leave vacuity in the mind.</P>
<P>My propen&s;ity to moralize u&s;ed for|merly [And our formerlies you know, brother, are not of any long duration.] to tea&s;e and half put you out of tem|per. Indulge me once more in hoping it will not do &s;o at pre&s;ent; for I believe I am more prone to this habit than ever. What can I &s;ay to my brother? Shall I tattle to him the &s;candal of the village, were I mi&s;tre&s;s of it? Shall I de&s;cribe to him the fa&s;hion of a new cap; or the charms of a dre&s;s that has lately travelled from Per&s;ia to Paris, from Paris to Lon|don, and from London to Ro&s;e-Bank?
<PB N="204" REF="209">
Or &s;hall I recount the hopes and fears of a &s;i&s;ter; who has &s;ometimes the temerity to think; who would be &s;o unfa&s;hiona|ble as to love her brother, not for the cut of his coat, not for the French or Italian phra&s;es with which he might in|terlard his di&s;cour&s;e, not for any recital of the delight which foreign ladies took in him and which he took in foreign la|dies, not for a loud tongue and a pro|digious lack of wit, not for any of the antics or impertinences which I have too frequently remarked in young men of fa&s;hion, but for &s;omething directly the rever&s;e of all the&s;e: for well-dige&s;ted principles, an ardent de&s;ire of truth, in|ce&s;&s;ant &s;truggles to &s;hake off prejudices; for emanations of &s;oul, bur&s;ts of thought, and fla&s;hes of genius. For &s;uch a bro|ther,
<PB N="205" REF="210">
oh how eager would be my arms, how open my heart!</P>
<P>Do not think, my dear Clifton, I am unju&s;t enough to mean any thing per|&s;onal; to &s;atirize what I can &s;carcely be &s;aid to have &s;een, or to condemn un|heard. No. Your faculties were always lively. You have &s;een much, mu&s;t have learned much, and why may I not &s;up|po&s;e you are become all that a &s;i&s;ter's heart can de&s;ire? Pardon me if I expect too much. Do we not all admire and &s;eek after excellence? When we are told &s;uch a per&s;on is a man of genius, do we not wi&s;h to enquire into the fact? And, if true, are we not de&s;irous of making him our intimate? And do not the ties of blood doubly enforce &s;uch wi&s;hes, in a brother's behalf? From what you
<PB N="206" REF="211">
were, I have no doubt but that you are become an accompli&s;hed man. But I hope you are al&s;o become &s;omething much better. I hope that, by the exer|tion of your talents, acquirements, and genius, I &s;hall &s;ee you the friend of man, and the true citizen of the world.</P>
<P>If you are all that I hope, I think you will not be offended with the&s;e &s;i&s;terly effu&s;ions. If you are not, or but in part, you may imagine me vain and im|pertinent. But &s;till I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e you will forgive me, becau&s;e you are &s;o &s;eldom troubled with &s;uch grave epi&s;|tles; and one now and then, if not in|tolerably long, may be endured from an elder &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Yet why do I &s;ay elder? Neither age nor &s;tation have any ju&s;t claim; for
<PB N="207" REF="212">
there can be none, except the claims of truth and rea&s;on; again&s;t which there is no appeal. I am eighteen months older than my brother, and up ri&s;es the claim of elder&s;hip! Such are the habits, the prejudices we have to counteract.</P>
<P>My dear mamma has mentioned Sir Arthur St. Ives, in her letter, and his lovely daughter, Anna; more lovely in mind even than in form, and of the lat|ter a &s;ingle glance will enable you to judge. I need not reque&s;t you to be attentive and civil to her, for it is im|po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be otherwi&s;e. Your own gratification will induce you to &s;hew her the public places, and render her every &s;ervice in your power; which will be more than overpaid by a&s;&s;ociating with her; for it is indeed a delight to be
<PB N="208" REF="213">
in her company. For grace and beauty of per&s;on, &s;he has no equal; and &s;till le&s;s can &s;he be equalled, by any per&s;on of her age, for the endowments of wit and under&s;tanding. I am half angry with my&s;elf for pretending to recom|mend her; when, as you will &s;ee, &s;he can &s;o much more effectually recommend her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add except to &s;ay that, when my dear brother has a moment's lei&s;ure, I &s;hall be glad to hear from him; and that I remain his very affectionate &s;i&s;ter,</P>

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> On recollection, I am convinced it is a fal&s;e fear which has prevented me from mentioning another per&s;on, very
<PB N="209" REF="214">
eminently de&s;erving of e&s;teem and re|&s;pect; a fear of doing harm where I meant to do good. We ought to do our duty, and ri&s;k the con&s;equences. The ab&s;urd pride of ance&s;try occa&s;ions many of our young gentlemen to treat tho&s;e whom they deem their inferiors by birth with haughtine&s;s, and often with &s;ome|thing wor&s;e; forgetting that by this means they immediately cut them&s;elves off as it were from &s;ociety: for, by con|temning tho&s;e who are a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tep below them, they encourage and incur contempt from the next immediately above them. This is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the practice: and, were it true that birth is any merit, it would be a practice to which we ought to pay a &s;till more &s;trict attention. The young gentleman how|ever
