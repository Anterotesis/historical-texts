<HEAD>ADDRESS TO THE PROFESSED PHILOSOPHICAL CRITICKS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should have taken earlier notice of the honour done me in your periodical lucubra|tions, had I been le&s;s indifferent to literary attacks, or could any body give a better rea&s;on than my&s;elf for di&s;regarding the cen&s;ure of anonymous reviewers. Yet, finding it a very general opinion that men only affect to de&s;pi&s;e, and turn their backs on, the &s;hafts they cannot repell, I am induced, again&s;t my inclination, and much again&s;t the dictates of my pride, to expo&s;tulate with you a moment on the incon&s;i&s;tency and in|ju&s;tice of your remarks on my account of the automaton, or &s;elf-moving wheel, of Orffyreus.</P>
<P>I was in hopes the very re&s;pectable authorities and explicit evidence, on which I re&s;ted the veracity of the fact, would have had more weight with men &s;o confe&s;&s;edly open to conviction as your&s;elves: all it &s;eems to have had on you, being to induce you to &s;coop out the marrow of my pamphlet for the entertainment of your readers, and to leave the bare bone to be picked by my book&s;eller.&mdash;But of this I do not complain. The republic of letters is ever in a &s;tate of civil warfare; in which every man, being an enemy to his neighbour, takes the &s;poil of his goods for lawful plunder. Indeed, were it otherwi&s;e, and the genus irritabile vatum more peaceable creatures, it would be &s;till much the &s;ame with you. Being pirates by profe&s;&s;ion and the public indulgence winking at your occupation as warrantable, you would doubtle&s;s think, with the highwayman in the play, there is no harm in labouring in your vocation.&mdash;What I do complain of, is, that having thus rendered my publication u&s;ele&s;s to me, my pub|li&s;her and the public, you &s;hould proceed to treat me as if I were an ignorant vi&s;ionary, capable of weakly deceiving my&s;elf, or a de&s;igning impo&s;tor capable of wilfully de|ceiving others.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">You are, &s;ome of you indeed, plea&s;ed to pay me the compliment of &s;aying, you have the highe&s;t opinion of my abilities as a writer. But is not this &s;trangely incon|&s;i&s;tent? Can you have an high opinion of the abilities of a writer, capable of impo&s;ing on him&s;elf, in one and the &s;ame pur&s;uit, for fifteen years together? A ca&s;tle-builder? A mi&s;taken projector?&mdash;Of what &s;ort of &s;tuff, for heaven's &s;ake, do you, wi&s;e critics, take good writers to be made? There was a time when you, or your predece&s;&s;ors, profe&s;&s;ed as high an opinion of my abilities as a metaphy&s;ician. Have I betrayed any want of metaphy&s;ical capacity &s;ince? Or is it becau&s;e I have occa&s;ionally mi&s;employed my&s;elf in tagging rhimes, tran&s;lating novels, &s;cribbling comedies, or, for want of a &s;ufficient independency in toiling like your&s;elves, invit&acirc; Minerv&acirc; for wor&s;e than Egyptian ta&s;k-ma&s;ters: is it from all this you infer I can know nothing of the &s;ubject, to the knowledge of which I was in a manner bred, and which I have made the con|&s;tant &s;tudy of my life? Really, Gentlemen, if you thus lightly pronounce and retract your opinion of writers and writings, the public will &s;oon learn to have no higher opinion of you than is entertained by tho&s;e who are already in your &s;ecret. So much for your con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>I charge you with inju&s;tice in &s;o ra&s;hly giving your &s;anction, however in&s;ignificant it may prove, to the powerful prejudice which &s;o generally prevails again&s;t the prac|ticability of a di&s;covery of confe&s;&s;ed and univer&s;al utility. For, give me leave to tell you, how ju&s;t &s;oever may be your preten&s;ions to &s;cience in general, you have by no means taken the pains to qualify your&s;elves to be competent judges of the perpetual motion in particular. If, then, it be deemed an in&s;tance of inju&s;tice and cruelty to attempt, through prejudice to bla&s;t the hopes of indu&s;trious ingenuity, employed in the production of a puerile play or frivolous farce; the compo&s;ition of which, what|ever drudgery it may prove to men of confined talents, cannot be the labour of any length of time to a writer of abilities: yet if this, I &s;ay, be thought cruel and unju&s;t, how much more unju&s;t and cruel mu&s;t it be deemed to endeavour to fortify prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the painful application, profound &s;tudy and patient per&s;everance, exerted in the pro&s;ecution of a &s;eries of expen&s;ive experiments, as I have &s;aid, for near fifteen years together; and tho&s;e in the very prime and plea&s;urable part of life?</P>
<P>When the object of &s;uch a pur&s;uit al&s;o is con&s;idered as u&s;eful to the public, it is not only injurious to the individual who hath thus devoted his youth, his health and even his means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to their &s;ervice; but to a whole community, that might expect to profit by his having made &s;o laborious and, it is pre&s;umed, laudable a &s;acri|fice. For the &s;ake of the public, for your own &s;ake, then, Gentlemen, let me pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ail on you to look a little farther into this matter before you proceed to confirm your dictatorial deci&s;ions on a &s;ubject, which you have &s;o very, very, &s;uperficially con|&s;idered.
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
Reflect that, whatever may be your di&s;po&s;ition towards me, it will be pru|dential with regard to your&s;elves, to promote, as far as lies in your power, a candid and impartial di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of my preten&s;ions; &s;ince, if I &s;hould make them good, you will thence avoid the mortification of becoming hereafter the objects of ridicule; and if I &s;hould not, you will have the triumph of &s;eeing me the more compleatly ridiculous. In the mean time there is no danger of the world's being impo&s;ed on; it is too well armed by its own prejudices to need any caution from you, even if the private emo|lument I propo&s;e to my&s;elf did not depend, as it entirely does, on the advantages of which my di&s;covery may prove to the public.</P>

<HEAD>APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT was my original de&s;ign, Gentlemen, to have given you the trouble of but one attendance on this lecture: but the doubts and objections, that have been &s;tarted &s;ince the publication of my Syllabus, have reduced me to the nece&s;&s;ity of letting them go unre&s;olved, or of enlarging my di&s;cour&s;e, if not beyond the bounds of your patience, beyond the abilities of an indifferent &s;peaker, ill qualified as unaccu&s;tomed to recite in publick.</P>
<P>To give the greater &s;atisfaction, therefore, on a &s;ubject &s;o much neglected, and of cour&s;e &s;o little under&s;tood, I &s;hall enter into a more minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it than I at fir&s;t intended, but which, I find by repeated intimations from tho&s;e to who&s;e judgment I pay a particular deference, the curio&s;ity of my auditors may require.</P>
<P>The mere exhibition of what is called a &s;elf-moving machine, without a di&s;|play of its mechani&s;m, or the principles on which its motion is begun and continued, could produce no conviction; would gratify no curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The fate of Orffyreus and his machine is a proof of this. Scarce fifty years ago that whim&s;ical mechanician exhibited a perpetual motion at He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el; the con&s;tancy of who&s;e operation was experienced, for many weeks under the mo&s;t exact caution of the Landgrave of that principality; who&s;e te&s;timony of &s;uch operation, as well as in favour of its con&s;truction, (to the &s;ecret of which he was admitted) was given in the mo&s;t explicit and determinate form.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">And yet, becau&s;e Orffyreus would not di&s;play the mechani&s;m of his machine, without the previous a&s;&s;urance of a premium of 200,000 florins (near twenty thou&s;and pounds) or becau&s;e he would not, or could not di&s;cover the principles on which it acted, his preten&s;ions were neglected; his machine was de&s;troyed by his own hands; and his life made a &s;acrifice to the chagrin attending his di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Twenty years had he racked his brains for invention; worn his hands with labour, and expended a patrimonial competence with par&s;imony, in pro&s;ecuting his de&s;ign. And, when &s;ucce&s;s in&s;pired the hope of reward, he found his ingenuity &s;u&s;pected of impo&s;ture and his indu&s;try rewarded with contempt. He died mad: a terrible example to all future projectors and particularly to pretenders to the perpetual motion!</P>
<P>Happy indeed is it for &s;ociety (though often peculiarly unhappy for them|&s;elves) that projectors never take warning.</P>
<P>One would hence be apt to think that, as they &s;ay of poets, they are born &s;uch and are impelled by a fatal nece&s;&s;ity to encounter poverty, contempt and even death it&s;elf, to attain the object of their pur&s;uit. It is otherwi&s;e difficult to account for &s;uch amazing per&s;everance as that of Orffyreus in &s;pite of in|numerable di&s;appointments, contradictions and railleries. To &s;tand the butt of ridicule for twenty years together, argues a degree of fortitude or ob&s;tinacy, call it which you will, almo&s;t incredible: yet &s;uch was the fact and &s;uch was the ill fate of Orffyreus.</P>
<P>Whether any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the &s;ame pur&s;uit will meet with a better, on the like pre&s;umption, is at length to be determined. One &s;pecies of our predece&s;&s;or's merit, however, I pre&s;ume my&s;elf at lea&s;t entitled to, that of per|&s;everance; it being now near fifteen years &s;ince I fir&s;t engaged in this under|taking: which I have &s;ince pur&s;ued with almo&s;t unremitted affiduity, and that not only at a con&s;iderable wa&s;te of time and expence, but under the con&s;tant mortification of hearing it equally ridiculed, by tho&s;e who do know, and by tho&s;e who do not know, any thing of the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="8">One conclu&s;ion, however, was very naturally to be hence inferred; that, either a man mu&s;t be invincibly &s;tupid, not to have in all that time di&s;covered his error, or that &s;uch error mu&s;t lie much deeper than to be &s;o univer&s;ally obvious, as is pretended.</P>
<P>The truth is, that the public in general, and even men of &s;cience, conceiv|ing the &s;ubject unworthy attention, have not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered the nature of it, to determine with certainty any thing about it. I could give a very plea&s;ant relation of the &s;trange mi&s;conceptions I have met with, on this head in per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank and reputation in the world of &s;cience. But as I know they were rather the effect of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion than incapacity, their future conviction will be a &s;ufficient reprehen&s;ion of their pa&s;t prejudice.</P>
<P>It is indeed generally &s;uppo&s;ed, and as confidently affirmed, that the mathe|maticians have publi&s;hed demon&s;trations of the impo&s;&s;ibility of a perpetual motion. But I can &s;afely take upon me to affirm that, no &s;uch demon&s;tration was ever publi&s;hed by any. Within the&s;e twelve years pa&s;t, the mathema|ticians who deny the po&s;&s;ibility of a perpetual motion, have been repeatedly and publickly called upon, both in the foreign and Engli&s;h prints, to produce a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the&s;e demon&s;trations. They have not done it. They could not do it.</P>
<P>They might have produced, indeed, the demon&s;trations of Huygens, De la Hire and others, to prove, as De&s;aguliers very properly expre&s;&s;es it, the fallacy of the &s;chemes of mo&s;t of the pretenders to the perpetual motion. But this was all. They proved nothing more; and this was &s;o far unnece&s;&s;ary, in that the fallacy evidently appeared on the di&s;covery of the principle, on which they were founded.</P>
<P>This was done in the la&s;t century by the celebrated Marquis of Worce&s;ter, in the pre&s;ence of the King and his Court, at the Tower; by the exhibition of a wheel, &s;o contrived that, in revolving on its axis, it carried up &s;everal weights nearer its centre on one &s;ide, than they de&s;cended on the other.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="9">The &s;cheme was plau&s;ible, and to appearance practicable: but, though the wheel was polite enough to turn about while his Maje&s;ty was pre&s;ent, it could not be prevailed upon to be &s;o complai&s;ant in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The court, however, was amu&s;ed and per&s;uaded: the Marquis was looked upon as a very extraordinary man (as he certainly was,) though, out of his cele|brated century of inventions, I think much the greater part died with him. The mathematicians avenged them&s;elves of the &s;hort triumph of the mi&s;taken Marquis; but were equally mi&s;taken them&s;elves, in thinking they had routed the problem, or that, in hunting down the jackal, they had de&s;troyed the lion.</P>
<P>The perpetual motion &s;urvived. It had &s;till its advocates. Profe&s;&s;or 'sGrave&s;ande and John Bernoulli maintained its practicability; the former giving his te&s;timony in favour of Orffyreus's machine after a long and &s;cru|tinous examination.</P>
<P>It is not twelve years &s;ince this te&s;timony was republi&s;hed, by Dr. Allaman, the pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;or of natural philo&s;ophy at Leyden; who&s;e own opinion, given at the &s;ame time, is al&s;o greatly in favour of the di&s;covery. It is even &s;ome years later that a di&s;&s;ertation, &s;till more in its favour, written, if I am not mi&s;taken, by the celebrated de Gorter of Peter&s;berg, appeared in the philo&s;o|phical tran&s;actions of Haarlem.</P>
<P>But to what purpo&s;e you will probably &s;ay, Gentlemen, is a reference to authorities in a matter, that &s;eems &s;o ea&s;ily decided?</P>
<P>To very little purpo&s;e indeed, unle&s;s to &s;hew that even the prejudices again&s;t this di&s;covery are not quite &s;o general among men of &s;cience, as among men of no &s;cience is generally imagined.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, perhaps, if the perpetual motion be practicable and the mode of rendering it &s;o di&s;covered, the &s;imple exhibition of the machine in motion, would at once remove doubt and enforce univer&s;al conviction, without farther trouble of explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10">Not &s;o, Gentlemen. I have already ob&s;erved that this was far from being the ca&s;e with Orffyreus. It is true the mechani&s;m of his machine was totally concealed; but, had it been otherwi&s;e; unle&s;s, with the di&s;play of its con&s;truc|tion, he had at the &s;ame time illu&s;trated its principles of action, and thence demon&s;trated the certainty of its continuing the motion, impre&s;&s;ed on it; &s;uch an exhibition would have &s;erved only to amu&s;e the ignorant, and per&s;uade the credulous.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;hould I content my&s;elf with the mere exhibition of the experiment I propo&s;e (demon&s;trative as it will be to tho&s;e who are previou&s;ly acquainted with the principles on which it is made) it might convey no conviction to others. For, unle&s;s I could comprize the &s;pace of a twelve month, within an hour, how could the mere motion of a machine for that hour prove its capacity of moving, in like manner, a whole year? Or how &s;hould a model, merely rai&s;ing a pound weight, prove a larger engine capable of rai&s;ing up an hundred, or a ton? And yet, if it would not, the di&s;covery mu&s;t be nugatory; and might, however plau&s;ible, be after all illu&s;ive.</P>
<P>But I can have no intere&s;t in per&s;uading the public into a futile belief of having di&s;covered what, being of no u&s;e to the world, can be of no advan|tage to me. My end is not to amu&s;e or per&s;uade; but, with due deference, to inform and convince.</P>
<P>To remove every cau&s;e of objection, therefore, I mu&s;t beg leave to tre&s;pa&s;s on your patience, by expatiating &s;omewhat more at large on the theory of this di&s;covery, than would on a le&s;s neglected topic be altogether pertinent to a practical di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It is, however, with the more propriety I pre&s;ume on this method, as the di&s;covery to which I pretend has not been (as frequently happens) the effect of mechanical accident; but the premeditated re&s;ult of mathematical rea&s;oning and phy&s;ical experiment.</P>
<P>In conformity to this mode of inve&s;tigation, I &s;hall not take up your time merely in con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uting a number of contradictory pleas, deduced a po&s;teriori from
<PB N="6" REF="11">
equivocal facts; but proceed to elucidate the principal arguments a priori, that prove the practicability of a perpetual motion to be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature. Were this impracticability indeed read, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, I &s;hall &s;hew that neither could you, Gentlemen, have done me the plea&s;ure of attending this lecture; nor &s;hould I have had the honour of reciting it.</P>

<PB REF="12">
<HEAD><HI>INTRODUCTION.</HI> On the Nature of Motion in general.</HEAD>
<P>MANY and various have been the opinions of philo&s;ophers, re&s;pecting the Nature of Motion. It has been urged, indeed, of late, by &s;ome eminent writers, that all attempts to define it, are vain and futile; it being utterly impo&s;&s;ible to define a &s;imple idea.</P>
<P>With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion however to great authorities, I mu&s;t take upon me to ob&s;erve that, the idea of motion, as &s;ugge&s;ted by phy&s;ical experiment, is very far from being a &s;imple idea. It is a complex notion, compo&s;ed of &s;everal ideas, viz. that of the re&s;i&s;tance of the moving object, of the medium through which it moves, and of the time it takes up in moving. For we can form no compleat conception of motion ab&s;tracted from either of the&s;e.</P>
<P>To give a clear definition, therefore, or explain the nature and cau&s;e of motion in general, it is nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate the &s;imple ideas, of which that of motion is compounded.</P>
<P>Metaphy&s;icians indeed have u&s;ually defined motion to be change of place, or a pa&s;&s;age from one place to another. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This was Epicurus's definition.&mdash;That of Ari&s;totle, <HI>actus entis in potentia quatenus in potentia,</HI> is condemned by Mr. Locke as ab&s;olute jargon.&mdash;Leibnitz cen&s;ures, as imperfect, that of Sturmeus, <HI>Succe&s;&s;iva rei motae in diver&s;is locis exi&s;tentia</HI>; and &s;ub&s;titutes another equally defec|tive, in calling it <HI>continua loci mutatie.</HI> In all the&s;e ca&s;es however it is plain the philo&s;ophers were endeavouring to give the definition of an ab&s;tract idea and not a palpable phaenomenon.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13">But change of place, or the mere tran&s;ition of any thing from one place to another, as that of thought, for in&s;tance, by the imagination, is not motion.</P>
<P>Some philo&s;ophers, indeed, and Mr. Colden in particular, have &s;poken of the motion of things, de&s;titute of the power of re&s;i&s;tance: but &s;uch motion mu&s;t be merely ideal. If the moving object have not &s;ome e&s;&s;ential re&s;i&s;tance, inde|pendant of its motion, its change of place would be impalpable as that of thought; or rather it could not change its place at all. Place is peculiar to re&s;i&s;ting objects and &s;uch only are the objects of phy&s;ical &s;cience. I now feel by its re&s;i&s;tance, that &s;omething exi&s;ts between my fingers. That re&s;i&s;tance is now gone, and there is nothing in its former place.</P>
<P>Again, mere change of place may be in&s;tantaneous. I can as &s;oon tran&s;port my&s;elf in imagination to York-Min&s;ter, as to St. Paul's Cathedral; to St. Peter's at Rome, as to Notre Dame at Paris: but the difference of time would be very con&s;iderable, in the removal of the &s;wifte&s;t animal to tho&s;e different places.</P>
<P>In con&s;tituting actual motion, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the moving object &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome kind of force, or impul&s;e; in con&s;equence of which it re&s;i&s;ts every other object of the like nature, in the line of its direction; and that not merely in proportion to its velocity; but in a ratio compounded of that velocity and the quantity of &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance. A &s;mall body in motion will not re&s;i&s;t an op|po&s;ing ob&s;tacle &s;o much as a great one of the &s;ame kind, moving with the &s;ame velocity.</P>
<P>Every moving object mu&s;t therefore be a re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance. But what is this &s;ub&s;tance? And what the cau&s;e of its re&s;i&s;tance? Here, Gentlemen, I mu&s;t beg leave to draw the line of definition.</P>
<P>It is admitted, that we cannot define a &s;imple idea; and &s;uch is that of phy&s;ical &s;ub&s;tance, immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to us by the &s;en&s;ation ari&s;ing from the re&s;i&s;t|ance of palpable objects.</P>
<P>To inve&s;tigate the primary cau&s;e of this re&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall not attempt. It is &s;ufficient, for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that we have the evidence of our &s;en&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="14">
that &s;uch objects exi&s;t. It had been well if natural philo&s;ophers had been always content to found their &s;y&s;tems on &s;uch evidence. We &s;hould then never have heard of &s;olid particles of matter, a perfect vacuum, or the motion of inactive elements by immediate impul&s;e; none of which are deducible from the &s;en&s;es; and natural philo&s;ophy is confined to the inve&s;tigation of things who&s;e exi&s;tence is to be rationally inferred from the evidence of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>A philo&s;opher indeed has lately &s;tarted up, who, affecting to be &s;hocked at the ab&s;urdities of the ideal &s;y&s;tem of Locke and Hume, has undertaken to reform it on the principles of common &s;en&s;e; in con&s;equence of which he affirms, that our notions of the qualities of bodies are none of them acquired by the &s;en&s;es: but that we are led to conceive them (he cannot tell how) by our nature and con&s;titution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Reid on the human mind, Chap. vi. Sect. 21.</NOTE> By our nature and con&s;titution to be &s;ure we are; for the&s;e con&s;i&s;t of the union and operation of the &s;en&s;es. Indeed this &s;ame philo&s;opher refines &s;o far as to &s;uppo&s;e we might have been &s;o made, as to ta&s;te with our fingers, to &s;mell with our ears, and to hear with our no&s;es.&mdash;Ri&s;um teneatis! What a pity he did not add too, under&s;tand with our elbows! This he might certainly as well have done as have a&s;&s;erted, that the judgment &s;ometimes precedes &s;imple apprehen&s;ion, as if the truth of a propo&s;ition might be known, before the terms of it are under&s;tood. But if this be common &s;en&s;e, it is common &s;en&s;e to &s;ay a man may &s;ee without eyes, hear without ears, and judge without under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>This method of rea&s;oning is &s;o far from improving philo&s;ophy on the prin|ciples of common &s;en&s;e, that it brings it back again to its ancient and exploded &s;tate of occult qualities and innate ideas.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed, therefore, on the well-known and e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of experimental philo&s;ophy; concluding, that all our ideas of the properties of bodies are derived from the &s;en&s;es, and that &s;uch evidence is &s;ufficient proof of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15">Now there never was, nor ever can be, a &s;ingle experiment made, from which we may ju&s;tly infer, that inactive elements of any ab&s;olute dimen&s;ions, or, as they are commonly called, extended, inert, impenetrable particles of matter, exi&s;t in nature.</P>
<P>That re&s;i&s;ting objects exi&s;t, we feel, and know. But that their re&s;i&s;tance is the effect of the ab&s;olute impenetrability of their con&s;tituent parts, we neither can feel, nor know. The penetrability of palpable objects (and &s;uch only I repeat again, can come under the &s;crutiny of phy&s;ical experiment) is merely relative.</P>
<P>By experience we learn that &s;ome bodies are comparatively more &s;oft or hard, penetrable or impenetrable, compre&s;&s;ible or incompre&s;&s;ible than others: but, when we &s;hall have found the harde&s;t and mo&s;t compact body in nature, we &s;hall only have found a body that is impenetrable to others le&s;s penetrable. We have no means to make trial of its own ab&s;olute impenetrability; for, even the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;oft clay is as impenetrable to &s;oft clay, as that of iron to iron. And the body which appears hard and impenetrable as iron to the gentle pre&s;&s;ure of a &s;oft hand, would appear &s;oft and penetrable to the forcible impul&s;e of a hand as hard as iron.</P>
<P>When Sir I&s;aac Newton therefore, inferred from the exten&s;ion, hardne&s;s and weight of palpable bodies, that the primary homogeneous elements of which all bodies are con&s;tituted mu&s;t be extended, &s;olid and heavy too, he rea|&s;oned illogically; as well as took that for granted which he &s;hould have proved. We find, &s;ays he, that &s;everal bodies are hard; and argue that the hardne&s;s of the whole only ari&s;es from the hardne&s;s of the parts: whence we infer that the particles, not only of perceptible bodies, but of all others, are hard likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>With all becoming deference, however, to the opinion of this great phi|lo&s;opher, it was but a weak way of arguing. Might not one &s;ay with equal propriety, &s;queezing a &s;oft piece of &s;punge or other &s;imilar &s;ub&s;tance in one's hand, that we find &s;everal bodies &s;oft and ela&s;tic, and therefore their primary particles, as well as tho&s;e of all others, are &s;oft and ela&s;tic too? Such argument
<PB N="11" REF="16">
is, indeed, altogether inconclu&s;ive. Palpable bodies are all compounds; and their various properties the effects of the combination of their parts, or the &s;pecific modification of the whole.</P>
<P>Were it otherwi&s;e, compounds would be mere aggregates of &s;imples: nor could there be any &s;pecific difference between them. The truth is, as already ob&s;erved, that all the terms by which we expre&s;s the properties of palpable ob|jects, are relative to the organs by which we perceive them. Nothing is ab&s;o|lutely &s;olid or impenetrable; but all things are big or little, hard or &s;oft, light or heavy, as they bear a compari&s;on with each other, and &s;tand related to the organs of &s;en&s;e: which form the common &s;tandard, by which we judge of their re&s;pective properties.</P>
<P>The misfortune is, that the conclu&s;ion we deduce from experiment, is fre|quently a mi&s;taken one. It is not thence really and logically deducible.</P>
<P>There is nothing in which people in general are more mi&s;taken than in the evidence of a &s;ingle &s;en&s;e. Even ocular demon&s;tration, generally &s;uppo&s;ed the mo&s;t convincing of all others, is of all others the mo&s;t delu&s;ive.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every one imagines him&s;elf capable of &s;eeing what no body can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee. Had we no other evidence, than that of &s;ight, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for us to di&s;tingui&s;h between a &s;uperficies and a &s;olid; between things near and afar off.</P>
<P>Length and breadth are objects of &s;ight; thickne&s;s not. We &s;ee only &s;ur|faces, and by the arts of per&s;pective might be con&s;tantly deluded. It is the &s;ame with the other &s;en&s;es. Thus when I feel a re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance; by the immediate touch, I perceive nothing but the &s;en&s;ation of that re&s;i&s;tance, and can truly infer nothing from it, but the exi&s;tence of a property, or power, of re&s;i&s;tance in the perceptible object. Here therefore we &s;hould &s;top.</P>
<P>But our philo&s;ophers proceed to infer that this object mu&s;t be an extended &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance. It mu&s;t have dimen&s;ions, &s;ay they, length, breadth and thick|ne&s;s. And yet by the &s;imple and immediate touch I perceive neither. By

moving my hand, indeed, along its edges and over its &s;urfaces, I gather by reflection, the idea of its exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>From the comparative evidence al&s;o of my other &s;en&s;es, I find that mo&s;t bodies, palpable to the touch, have the appearance of &s;olidity: they exhibit a determinate form and figure. But I ob&s;erve, that this apparent &s;olidity is in many bodies adventitious and circum&s;tantial; dependent on the qualities of the medium, in which they exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Bodies of &s;light tenacity appear, in cold countries, in the &s;olid form of wax, butter, tallow and the like; and a&s;&s;ume in warm climates the fluid appear|ance of oil. Water, a perpetual fluid under the equator, is &s;olid ice in Nova Zembla. Even quick&s;ilver will become &s;olid, in a medium of artificial cold, as has been experienced at Peter&s;burg.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;o tough and heavy a body as lead, di&s;&s;olves in a medium moderately warm, and even &s;teel it&s;elf becomes fluid, in the highly rarified medium of an heated furnace.</P>
<P>A reflection on the&s;e circum&s;tances, hath induced &s;ome philo&s;ophers to que&s;tion whether fluidity or &s;olidity be, properly &s;peaking, the natural &s;tate of bodies. And this, however ridiculed by &s;ome, would have been a que&s;tion worthy of philo&s;ophers, if the terms, natural &s;tate, had borne a more explicit and determinate meaning.</P>
<P>But, be this as it may, when I &s;ee thus the &s;ame body at one time and place, and under &s;ome circum&s;tances, a &s;olid, and, at another time, or in another place, and under other circum&s;tances, a fluid; what rea&s;on have I to conclude &s;olidity e&s;&s;entially connected with re&s;i&s;tance? Certainly none. At the &s;ame time, however I find, that under all circum&s;tances, in all times and places, the re&s;i&s;tance of the body remains. Though varied in its mode of appearance, its quantity is &s;till the &s;ame. Inclo&s;e it in any containing ve&s;&s;el and it will equally re&s;i&s;t compre&s;&s;ion in a fluid as a &s;olid &s;tate, it will move, or re&s;i&s;t any moving body, with the &s;ame force as a &s;olid of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions and den&s;ity.
<PB N="13" REF="18">
The &s;imple re&s;i&s;tance of body, therefore, is an e&s;&s;ential quality inherent in every moving object or phy&s;ical &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o the only e&s;&s;ential quality we can a&s;&s;ign it: all that we can philo&s;o|phically affirm of the primary elements, being that they are moveable powers of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Some of you, Gentlemen, will perhaps find it difficult to form the idea of a power ab&s;tracted from &s;ome &s;ub&s;tratum, or extended &s;ub&s;tance, in which that power &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. But I can a&s;&s;ure you that inability is more owing to your being &s;o accu&s;tomed to the notions of void &s;pace, and impenetrable matter, than to any incapacity of conception. Mr. Locke &s;ays, it is as ea&s;y to form an idea of power in the ab&s;tract as of &s;ub&s;tance; and indeed I &s;hould think it is full as difficult to conceive the e&s;&s;ence of an inactive, impenetrable &s;ub&s;tance of ab&s;o|lute dimen&s;ions, incapable of compre&s;&s;ion and dilatation, as that of an active ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance of relative dimen&s;ions capable of both. We do not pre&s;ume in general to impute dimen&s;ions to the great fir&s;t cau&s;e, and yet we cannot di&s;pute his exi&s;tence or omnipotence. It is indeed to be ob&s;erved that phy&s;ical prin|ciples are not founded &s;o much on the per&s;picuity of our ideas, as on the certainty of our &s;en&s;ations. They are more immediately deduced from the conceptions, however ob&s;cure, of what we perceive, and thence conclude, really to exi&s;t, than on ab&s;tract notions of nonentities or things of meer ideal exi&s;tence. We know that things exi&s;t only by their properties. We define their e&s;&s;ence only by the&s;e properties; nor are we permitted, in natural philo&s;ophy, to indulge the imagination, in forming conceptions of chimerical &s;ub&s;trata, to which tho&s;e properties belong.</P>
<P>We feel and know that moveable re&s;i&s;ting powers exi&s;t; but whether the action or exertion of tho&s;e powers be confined to certain determinate limits, within which their inten&s;ity is fixed and ab&s;olute, as in impenetrable matter, or whether they are capable of occupying a greater or le&s;s quantity of &s;pace, with an inten&s;ity proportionable to their dimen&s;ions, as in ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tances, are que&s;tions we &s;hall be better able to determine, from con&s;idering the other component parts of motion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="19">To come to that of the place, or the &s;pace in which the moving object exi&s;ts. This is generally conceived to be mere vacuity, a phy&s;ical nonentity; rather a privation, or negation, of exi&s;tence than any thing really exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>But however ju&s;tly we may rea&s;on on negative terms, in algebra and other branches of metaphy&s;ics, we cannot admit negative principles in phy&s;ics. Qualities, however occult in their e&s;&s;ence, mu&s;t be po&s;itive in their exi&s;tence. We cannot explain or account for animal perception; but that we do perceive, cannot be di&s;puted. At lea&s;t tho&s;e who doubt that they &s;ee, hear and feel, may be not uncharitably &s;uppo&s;ed to doubt every thing el&s;e. And it would be in vain to attempt their conviction.</P>
<P>Exten&s;ion indeed, is not to be immediately inferred from the &s;imple touch; but it is from the fight. The length and breadth of any body, and the di&s;tance between any two bodies, is as vi&s;ible to the eye, as the &s;urfaces of tho&s;e bodies them&s;elves, or as their re&s;i&s;tance is palpable to the touch. Space therefore hath as real an exi&s;tence as phy&s;ical power, or re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It may be objected that, if the magnitude of the re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance be mere|ly relative, it would be reducible by a &s;ufficient force ad infinitum, and the whole univer&s;e be compre&s;&s;ible into a mathematical point; in which ca&s;e the exten&s;ion of bodies, as well as their di&s;tance, would be annihilated, and of cour&s;e no &s;pace remain.</P>
<P>That the annihilation of phy&s;ical power, or re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance, would anni|hilate phy&s;ical &s;pace, I readily admit: Nay that the accumulation of all &s;uch powers or &s;ub&s;tances into one individual power or &s;ub&s;tance would annihilate motion. But, &s;o long as they remain divided, &s;o long as two &s;ub&s;tances coexi&s;t, though each &s;eparately were confined to a mathematical point, and the addition or multiplication of cyphers in arithmetic amount to nothing, yet there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;ome real exten&s;ion, or po&s;itive di&s;tance, however &s;mall, between them. They would otherwi&s;e not be two &s;ub&s;tances; not two mathematical points; but one.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="20">If it were po&s;&s;ible for two bodies to come into actual contact, without becom|ing really one, their two adjoining &s;urfaces would con&s;titute but one point or ideal plane of &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Number and identity depend either on locality or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It is impo&s;&s;ible for two objects of the &s;ame nature to exi&s;t in the &s;ame place, at the &s;ame time. They mu&s;t be either di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome po&s;itive di&s;tance of place, if they exi&s;t at the &s;ame time, or by &s;ome po&s;itive di&s;tance of time if they exi&s;t in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>Hence it is plain that, were the potential elements of re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance even mere mathematical points, the coexi&s;tence of a prodigious number of them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily de&s;cribe a va&s;t extent of &s;pace, even though the di&s;tance between each &s;hould be ever &s;o little.</P>
<P>And hence we &s;ee al&s;o that duration, the other component part of motion, hath as real an exi&s;tence, as either exten&s;ion or re&s;i&s;tance. Indeed the tran&s;ition of body from place to place, is frequently as obvious to &s;en&s;e, as either the bodies them&s;elves, or the di&s;tance between them.</P>
<P>We are here al&s;o to ob&s;erve that the limits of bodies form no part of their ex|ten&s;ion or place. Extended objects may be &s;eparated by dimen&s;ionle&s;s points; but dimen&s;ionle&s;s points cannot be &s;eparated, but by &s;ome real di&s;tance, or &s;omething really extended. If the wall or partition were taken away, that &s;eparates this room and the next adjoining, we &s;hould either call it one room, or &s;hould allow that the two rooms were divided only by their di&s;tance of place. But there would be no di&s;tance between the ea&s;t &s;ide of one and the we&s;t of the other. The we&s;t &s;ide of the one might neverthele&s;s be at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the we&s;t &s;ide of the other; as the ea&s;t &s;ide of the one would be at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the ea&s;t &s;ide of the other. There would be al&s;o two points in the middle of each equally di&s;tant, which would determine the locality of the two rooms, or the di&s;tance of their re&s;pective places.</P>
<P>Thus the place of a dimen&s;ionle&s;s point, is in that point; but the place of an extended &s;ub&s;tance, is in the centre of its dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="21">We are come then to this dilemma; either the re&s;i&s;ting elements them&s;elves mu&s;t be compre&s;&s;ible only to a certain degree; that is into certain dimen&s;ions, within which they cannot be reduced; or the di&s;tance between them, if reduci|ble to dimen&s;ionle&s;s points, mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely po&s;itive; a conclu&s;ion that, involving an impenetrable fluid, is equally repugnant to motion, with that of impenetrable matter exi&s;ting in vacuo.</P>
<P>From the very phaenomenon of motion it&s;elf, therefore, we are reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of concluding; that the elements among which it is originally generated, are ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tances of a determinate power, limited as to their degree of compre&s;&s;ibility, and doubtle&s;s al&s;o, as finite created beings, to that of their dilatation: within the bounds of which however, the inten&s;ity of their re&s;i&s;tance or ela&s;tic force is, like that of all other ela&s;tic bodies, proportional to to their den&s;ity, or the dimen&s;ions they de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>As a Corollary of this propo&s;ition it will follow that &s;pace is a plenum; not of one &s;olid impenetrable matter, but of innumerable ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tances, mu|tually re&s;i&s;ting each other; and con&s;tituting by their coexi&s;tence, an ela&s;tic fluid medium; &s;imilar, if not exactly the &s;ame, with the &s;ubtile aether hinted at by Sir I&s;aac Newton, and who&s;e exi&s;tence is &s;o fully confirmed by the electrical ex|periments of Dr. Hoadley and Mr. Wil&s;on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not that there would he no inter&s;tices between the elements. This appears nece&s;&s;ary as each element would a&s;&s;ume a &s;pherical form, and touch the contiguous elements only in a few points.</NOTE></P>
<P>It will follow al&s;o, from the known properties of ela&s;tic fluids, that no change of place could be effected in &s;uch a medium, but in time, as we &s;ee all motion is. And that motion, once generated in &s;uch a medium, might be propagated and continued ad perpetuum.</P>
<P>On the other hand, were the moving elements ab&s;olutely &s;olid, inactive and heavy, exi&s;ting in vacuo; they could neither be put in actual motion, nor, if po&s;&s;ible to be put in motion, could that motion be long continued.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="22">Sir I&s;aac Newton him&s;elf, indeed, gives up the point with re&s;pect to the gravity of the primary elements; which, he admits, may be the effect of &s;ome mecha|nical impul&s;e: abiding only by the &s;olidity, and vis inertiae of tho&s;e elements, or their perfect indifference to motion and re&s;t. It was the admi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e &s;olid, impenetrable particles of matter into his &s;y&s;tem, which reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of admitting al&s;o of a vacuum. Without this, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for his elements to undergo that change of place, and in that manner, which all bodies evidently do.</P>
<P>With regard to their actual motion indeed, he did not pretend to account for it, otherwi&s;e than by an occult and in&s;tantaneous impul&s;e, arbitrarily exerted or impre&s;&s;ed on them by the will of the creator. But I &s;hall &s;hew, that this could not be the ca&s;e, con&s;i&s;tently with the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature.</P>
<P>In the generation of motion among palpable bodies, exi&s;ting in a re&s;i&s;ting medium, the bodies at re&s;t are always moved with a velocity proportionable partly to the velocity and quantity of the body putting them in motion, and partly to the den&s;ity of the medium in which they move: Being compounds, their velocity is generated between the component parts of each; for it is to be ob&s;erved, that the parts of the one body do not all directly &s;trike again&s;t, or impell, all tho&s;e of the other. There are but a few of tho&s;e parts that come immediately in contact, the re&s;t are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively impelled and repelled by each other till the whole be gradually affected, the compound it&s;elf not actually changing its place, till all its component parts are equally impelled. And this is the rea&s;on, as I &s;hall more fully explain hereafter, why bodies can in no ca&s;e communicate more motion than they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and that even this mu&s;t be equally di&s;tributed in the conflict among their component parts, before the whole body be put in motion.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e however would be different in the original motion &s;uppo&s;ed to be given to a &s;imple uncompounded element, equally indifferent to motion and re&s;t, exi&s;ting in a perfect vacuum. For this, being &s;olicited by a determinate impul&s;e on one &s;ide, and there being no re&s;i&s;tance to that impul&s;e in the element it&s;elf, nor from the medium on the other, it could not be di&s;po&s;ed to take up any time in pa&s;&s;ing from one place to another; but might, for any thing that
<PB N="18" REF="23">
appears to the contrary, move a million of miles in any given time as well as a &s;ingle foot.</P>
<P>For, be the impul&s;e great or &s;mall, being in&s;tantaneous and the element it|&s;elf perfectly indifferent to motion and re&s;t: and, there being no re&s;i&s;tance in the medium, no proportionable velocity could po&s;&s;ibly be generated. Nullity has the &s;ame want of proportion to one as to one million!</P>
<P>Lord Kaims who&s;e acknowledged abilities were exerted &s;ome years ago in the illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject, &s;uppo&s;es indeed, that the generation and com|munication of motion is in all ca&s;es in&s;tantaneous. In analyzing the operation however, he is obliged to divide it into three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;teps. But it is a con|tradiction in terms to &s;uppo&s;e any action to be at once in&s;tantaneous and gradual.</P>
<P>This &s;uppo&s;ition is al&s;o founded on the mi&s;conception of the ab&s;olute &s;olidity of bodies, and an inattention to the cau&s;e and mechani&s;m of cohe&s;ion; which I mean to explain.</P>
<P>Admitting however, that motion were not the mechanical effect of a phy&s;ical cau&s;e; but immediately given to &s;uch inactive elements by the fiat of the creator, the con&s;equence, as Sir I&s;aac Newton him&s;elf admits, is obvious; their motion would, by their mutual colli&s;ions, be &s;oon utterly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The evident nece&s;&s;ity of renewing it therefore, in order to keep up the &s;y&s;tem, induced him to hint at the exi&s;tence of &s;ome active principle in that of a &s;ubtile aether, or ela&s;tic fluid, agreeably to the &s;y&s;tem I have adopted.</P>
<P>Later philo&s;ophers have devi&s;ed various other expedients. Mac Laurin &s;up|po&s;es there may be different kinds of moveable elements or matter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of different degrees of inactivity.</P>
<P>Dr. Knight conceives the whole &s;y&s;tem of nature to be kept up by the mutual exertions of two active principles, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in his elements of attraction and repul&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24">Mr. Colden, in his treati&s;e on the principles of action in matter, &s;uppo&s;es that there are at lea&s;t three kinds e&s;&s;entially different, a re&s;i&s;ting matter, a mov|ing matter, and an ela&s;tic matter, neither re&s;i&s;ting nor moving.</P>
<P>Lord Kaims conceives that all matter is endowed with three powers or pro perties; fir&s;t, that of continuing it&s;elf in motion; &s;econdly, that of re&s;i&s;ting a change from re&s;t to motion; and thirdly, that of gravitation; or, as he expre&s;&s;es it, a power to unite it&s;elf with every other piece of matter.</P>
<P>On the other hand Dr. Stewart profe&s;&s;or of natural philo&s;ophy at Edinburgh, rejects any &s;uppo&s;ed activity in matter, or the moving object, conceiving it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;olve the phaenomena of nature, on mechanical principles alone. The mutual repul&s;ion and attraction which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between palpable &s;olids and between the fluids in which &s;uch &s;olids &s;wim (for &s;o he terms it) he regards as the continual effects of thought and de&s;ign in the fir&s;t immaterial cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I leave metaphy&s;icians to treat of the immediate effects of immaterial cau&s;es.

To &s;ay why the &s;ame homogeneous re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance &s;hould &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly enter into the compo&s;ition of &s;uch different bodies; why the &s;ame moving object is now the apparently inert and in&s;en&s;ible &s;tratum of a fo&s;&s;ile, now the moving and &s;en&s;itive fibre of a vegetable, and now the active and &s;en&s;ible nerve of an animal. To &s;ay why the marrow that forms the brain of a goo&s;e may in a &s;hort time form the brain of a philo&s;opher: all this, I &s;ay, mu&s;t be imputed to the in&s;crutinable direction of a &s;uperior metaphy&s;ical agent: to that omni&s;|cient and omnipotent cau&s;e by whom we live, move, and have our being.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="25">But to be a&s;&s;ured that a re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance exi&s;ts; that &s;uch an univer&s;al prin|ciple or power of reaction really prevails; and to determine the con&s;tant and regular method in which the various revolutions, as well of the particular &s;y&s;tems of bodies, as the general &s;y&s;tem of nature, are mechanically performed; this is within our reach. Demon&s;tration and experiment, indeed, are confined within the narrow limits of &s;en&s;e.

<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> On the Cau&s;e and Effects of Motion.</HEAD>
<P>PRESUMING, on what has been &s;aid, Gentlemen, that I have given &s;ome &s;atisfactory idea of the nature and cau&s;e of motion in general; and taking it for granted that the &s;imple&s;t moving object is an ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance, who&s;e dimen|&s;ions are determined by the re&s;i&s;tance of the like objects &s;urrounding it; and not an impenetrable &s;ub&s;tance of a determinate form and ab&s;olute dimen&s;ions. I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew that motion is the natural and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of any inequality, by whatever means introduced, in the reciprocal re&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch primary elements.</P>
<P>It may be previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, however, to dwell a little on the mode of action of &s;uch elements.</P>
<P>Ela&s;ticity is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of the modification of the parts of ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tances. That of compound bodies indeed is &s;o, but ela&s;ticity in the &s;imple elements is the primary cau&s;e, not a &s;econdary effect, of motion.</P>
<P>And here we are led to make the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction between motion and action. Action is properly a phy&s;ical term, motion a mechanical one.</P>
<P>We do indeed u&s;e the word action in mechanics, when we &s;peak of the appli|cation of mechanic powers; but the di&s;tinction between action and motion even here is evident, the motion of the parts of a machine about their common centre of gravity may be called its action. The change of place of the whole machine is its motion. The action even of a &s;imple lever, is its turning on its
<PB N="23" REF="28">
fulcrum or point of re&s;t. Its motion would be the change of that fulcrum for another.</P>
<P>In circular motions, it is true, we commonly &s;ay, that a thing turns, or moves round its axis; but if the centre of gravity continue in the centre of motion, the place of the whole is not changed. It may be &s;aid to act, if you will, but it cannot properly be &s;aid to move.</P>
<P>Every &s;imple motion mu&s;t be recti-linear. Whatever moves mu&s;t move in &s;ome one particular direction. It cannot move two ways at once. And though its direction may be changed every moment as in apparently circular motions, effected by the re&s;i&s;tance of &s;urrounding ob&s;tacles, every apparent circle is only a polygon of an imperceptible number of &s;ides: the&s;e &s;ides them&s;elves being de&s;cribed merely by motion, as I &s;hall hereafter explain.</P>
<P>Mathematicians may amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;quaring the circle, and illu&s;trat|ing the doctrine of infinites by the ratios &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between &s;trait lines and circles. There is no &s;uch thing as a circle in phy&s;icks. Infinite ratios may exi&s;t in idea, but infinite quantities do not exi&s;t in nature.</P>
<P>And, though we might rea&s;on as truly about infinites as finites in geometry, we mu&s;t exclude the former from natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>We may endeavour to imagine an infinity of &s;pace and an eternity of dura|tion, but we can perceive, and thence have a phy&s;ical idea of, nothing but what is limited both as to place and time. Agreeably to this, it is very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, by a late ingenious writer on the doctrine of fluctions, that quantities them|&s;elves are not properly the objects of arithmetic or geometry; but only the ratios of quantities.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Colden. See Enquiry into the principles of action in matter.</NOTE></P>
<P>Even the recti-linear exten&s;ion of bodies, as I ju&s;t now hinted, is a fluction. It is the mechanical effect of motion. The primary elements, though their re&s;i&s;tance be local, do not exert that re&s;i&s;tance in any one particular direction.
<PB N="24" REF="29">
Their dimen&s;ions are not limited by right lines. If it were, they could not pre&s;erve their e&s;&s;ential properties of number and identity, on which their very exi&s;tence as elements depends. They might, like the &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance of the Newtonians, be divi&s;ible ad infinitum; without lo&s;ing any e&s;&s;ential property imputed to them.</P>
<P>A right line may be divided into any number of parts, each of tho&s;e parts would be as compleat and perfect a right line as the whole. But phy&s;ical ele|ments cannot be divided, without being de&s;troyed, or dive&s;ted of their re&s;i&s;t|ance; the quality e&s;&s;ential to their exi&s;tence. Thus the divi&s;ion of an ela&s;tic element would de&s;troy its ela&s;ticity. But divi&s;ion and de&s;truction are two things. Compounds may be cut to pieces and de&s;troyed; but the wi&s;dom of Solomon could not divide one child between two mothers.</P>
<P>You will perhaps wonder, Gentlemen, by what line the exten&s;ion of &s;uch elements can be de&s;cribed; if no &s;uch thing as a circle exi&s;ts and right lines are the mere mechanical effect of motion.</P>
<P>It may be de&s;cribed by a line, which is neither circular nor recti-linear; one that cannot be divided into lines of the &s;ame kind, or divided at all without lo&s;ing its e&s;&s;ential property, by &s;uch divi&s;ion. This is the &s;piral, a form which ren|ders every body in nature capable of &s;upporting it, ela&s;tic.</P>
<P>I &s;ay capable of &s;upporting it, becau&s;e Mr. Colden &s;ays, it is to him incon|ceiveable why a &s;piral &s;hape, or any &s;hape or arrangement of the parts of any thing, &s;hould give it any power which it had not before.</P>
<P>A &s;piral of lead, continues he, is as little ela&s;tic as a &s;trait line of lead.&mdash;True it is nearly &s;o, but why? Becau&s;e lead is too &s;oft and pliant to &s;upport the form of a &s;piral.</P>
<P>Will he &s;ay a &s;piral of &s;teel is no more ela&s;tic than a &s;trait line of &s;teel? Has a watch &s;pring wound up, no more ela&s;tic force than when it is run down?</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="30">The contrary is evident. Mr. Colden mi&s;takes the argument. It is not denied that the power of &s;u&s;taining the form of a &s;piral, lies in the component parts and compo&s;ition of the &s;teel, but it is not &s;aid that a greater ela&s;ticity is given to the &s;teel it&s;elf, by its being formed into a &s;piral than it had before. No alteration is made in that arrangement of parts, in con&s;equence of which &s;teel differs &s;pecifically from lead, or any other metal.</P>
<P>If I take a piece of &s;trait wire and turn it three or four times round my finger, the &s;teel is &s;till &s;teel, and of the &s;ame temper as before; though it has acquired a &s;piral form. It is not the e&s;&s;ential arrangement of the con&s;tituent parts of the &s;teel, but the local arrangement of the parts of the &s;trait line that is affected.</P>
<P>It is this new arrangement of parts that generates a new being, who&s;e mode of re&s;i&s;tance is peculiar to its form; and which, &s;o long as that arrangement en|dures, will endure al&s;o, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting and cea&s;ing with it.</P>
<P>An inattention to this circum&s;tance has occa&s;ioned innumerable di&s;appoint|ments to mechanicians, endeavouring to profit by the ela&s;ticity of &s;prings. Attentive to the general rule that &s;prings unbend with the &s;ame force with which they are bent; and that their ela&s;tic force in general depends on the temper of the metal; they forget that the ela&s;ticity of each particular &s;pring depends im|mediately on its form, and that &s;uch form is varied according as the &s;pring is bent with a greater or le&s;s velocity. The compre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame piece of &s;teel is therefore not always that of the &s;ame &s;pring; nor will its dilatation have an equal effect, unle&s;s directly on the &s;ame body that compre&s;&s;es it.&mdash; This, and this only, &s;eems to be the rea&s;on why profe&s;&s;or 'sGrave&s;ande's clear de|mon&s;tration of the po&s;&s;ibility of the perpetual motion, has not been long &s;ince confirmed by practice.</P>
<P>This error is the common effect of the popular notion of &s;uppo&s;ing the properties of things attached to &s;ome &s;ub&s;tratum or &s;ub&s;tance, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e properties.</P>
<P>The &s;pecific powers of every palpable body in nature are the effect of the arrangement or motion of its con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="31">Even from the primary homogeneous elements exclu&s;ive, to the compli|cated body of the whole univer&s;e, the arrangement of the parts of one thing con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of another. The very exi&s;tence and different properties of fo&s;&s;iles, minerals, vegetables, brutes, all depend on, and are the immediate effect of, the arrangement of their &s;pecific corpu&s;cles; in like manner depen|dent on that of the primary elements.</P>
<P>Thus it is not pretended that the different arrangement of the parts of any thing, can give new powers to that very thing: a different arrangement would con&s;titute a new thing. If a watch &s;pring and the &s;teel of which it is compo&s;ed were one and the &s;ame thing, there would be no occa&s;ion for watch-&s;pring makers; the arti&s;t and his art would be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The propriety of conceiving the action of the primary elements exerted &s;pirally, is further evident from the reflection that, we thence avoid the con|tradiction of &s;uppo&s;ing one and the &s;ame influence exerted in two contrary directions at one and the &s;ame time; as would be the ca&s;e in conceiving it exerted by emanation in &s;trait lines on every &s;ide from a centre; whereas in the ca&s;e pre&s;umed, the action of &s;uch element is one &s;imple undivided action, the exertion of the influence of a &s;ingle indivi&s;ible power; from the nece&s;&s;ary effect of which, its reaction upon the contiguous elements, is neverthele&s;s exert|ed on every &s;ide in recti-linear radii from its centre.</P>
<P>Thus when I compre&s;s a watch &s;pring between my fingers and thumb, the re&s;i&s;tance or reaction of the &s;pring is exerted each way from the centre of the coil in the line of its diameter; but the action of the &s;pring is exerted only in the &s;ingle direction of the coil; the ends of it moving backwards and forwards in dilatation and contraction &s;olely in that direction.</P>
<P>More depends on this individuality or identity of objects than may readily occur, both with re&s;pect to their action and motion. It is the property or horologary power of a clock or watch to divide the time, and point out the hours of night and day. Will any one doubt that &s;uch a thing as a clock exi&s;ts? or that its e&s;&s;ential property is the mechanical effect of its arrangement of parts?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="32">Separate tho&s;e parts from each other or give them a different arrangement; they have no longer the &s;ame property. The clock is annihilated, though every wheel and pinion of it remain, uninjured, whole and entire. I might pur&s;ue the allu&s;ion through all nature; but &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the imme|diate object of this lecture.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of a perpetual motion, &s;ays De la Hire, would be to di&s;cover a body at once heavier and lighter than it&s;elf. But this is not a fair &s;tate of the que&s;tion. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that all the parts of a perpetually-moving machine &s;hould be attached to, and in&s;eparable from each other. Which they mu&s;t be, to con&s;titute one gravitating body of a determinate weight.</P>
<P>In animals the blood circulates freely through their veins and arteries in all po&s;itions of the containing ve&s;&s;els; every globule of blood in the body has a centre of gravity of its own, independent of the centre of gravity of the whole body. A con&s;iderable quantity of blood may be taken away, and, thence dimini&s;h the weight of the body, without putting a &s;top to its motion, or di|mini&s;hing its activity; which, if the perpetual motion were on this account impracticable, could not be. Indeed were &s;uch the ca&s;e, on this or any other account, the blood in a man's body, when &s;tanding erect, would fall into the legs and feet, nor could the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e&s;t and the &s;trength of the &s;tronge&s;t man united, rai&s;e it up again. This circulation indeed is generally imputed to the dilatation and contraction of the heart. But to what is the motion of the heart imputed? Neither to the wit of the wi&s;e, nor the will of the wilful.</P>
<P>It is &s;hewn by Dr. Keil that if the circulation of the blood were once &s;topped, not all the mu&s;cular force of the heart would put it again in motion.</P>
<P>It is, in fact, the circulation of the blood that keeps up the motion of the heart, not the heart the circulation of the blood. The incumbent pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere on the blood ve&s;&s;els cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the cau&s;e, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, of the ri&s;e of the blood in the veins. A partial compre&s;&s;ion indeed might cau&s;e a partial &s;tagnation of the blood, but an undequaque pre&s;&s;ure can never be the cau&s;e of its general circulation. Be&s;ides, Mr. Boyle hath &s;hewn that the heart of a frog beats as regularly, and as &s;trongly, in vacuo, as in the open air.&mdash;
<PB N="28" REF="33">
The circulation of the blood, and, in con&s;equence of that, all the animal func|tions, are, and mu&s;t be, kept up by &s;ome mechani&s;m in the body by means of which the blood ri&s;es, either in &s;maller globules or by &s;ome other means, &s;o as to gain a force on gravity, to repair the motion di&s;&s;ipated by its friction again&s;t the containing ve&s;&s;els. And that &s;uch force is to be &s;o gained, I &s;hall hereafter prove by the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible experiment.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I &s;hall only beg leave to exhibit a very &s;imple one univer&s;ally con|ceived to be as much an impo&s;&s;ibility as the perpetuol motion it&s;elf; by which however that impo&s;&s;ibility as well as the ab&s;urdity exploded by De la Hire, appears to be really a fact. It is notorious that the pre&s;&s;ure of a &s;mall quantity of a fluid is the &s;ame again&s;t the &s;ides of the containing ve&s;&s;el as that of the greate&s;t quantity at equal depths; the pre&s;&s;ure of fluids following &s;imply the proportion of their depth. Hence if the area of a ve&s;&s;el be &s;mall and its depth great, a very &s;mall weight of water will pre&s;s again&s;t the bottom with prodigious force. Nay, by means of a ve&s;&s;el of different areas, at different heights, as a barrel with a perpendicular pipe carried through its head: if the head of the barrel be moveable and yet water-tight, a little water, poured into the pipe, will actually rai&s;e up a va&s;t weight laid upon the head of the barrel. Here a &s;mall quantity of a fluid hath comparatively as much weight or gravitating force as a greater. Now I &s;hall &s;hew that this is not only the ca&s;e with different quantities of a fluid; but that the &s;ame individual &s;olid will, in like circum&s;tances, appear to have a le&s;s and a greater weight than it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t however beg leave to ob&s;erve, that there are two methods of e&s;timating the weight of bodies. One is by the common ballance, by which their comparative weight only is determined; being weighed one again&s;t another or again&s;t &s;ome third body, which is made the common &s;tandard of compari&s;on between both.</P>
<P>The other is by the ela&s;ticity of &s;prings, which &s;u&s;tain weights equal to their ela&s;tic force. This determines the real weight: one body not de&s;cending as in the ballance, in proportion as another ri&s;es; but de&s;cending in proportion as the &s;pring is bent; the ela&s;tic force of the &s;pring being oppo&s;ed to the gravita|ting force of the body. Hence it appears evidently impo&s;&s;ible that the perpen|dicular
<PB N="29" REF="34">
pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;ame body, &s;hould not equally compre&s;s the &s;ame &s;pring: the ela&s;tic force of the &s;pring being the mea&s;ure of the gravitating force of the body. Yet &s;ee, Gentlemen, here is a ring of tempered &s;teel; which, being placed within the edges of this box, is compre&s;&s;ed by means of this fulcrum. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See plate 1. fig. I.</NOTE> The fulcrum it&s;elf is nothing more than a &s;trait piece of bra&s;s, projecting horizontally from two parallel perpendicular &s;liders, on the top of which is placed the weight. Till the &s;pring be placed under the fulcrum, the latter will &s;upport no weight at all; but both the &s;liders may be moved up and down, together with the fulcrum, with the &s;ame ea&s;e: A proof that when the &s;pring is placed under the fulcrum, no oppo&s;ition is made from any other cau&s;e to either. And yet when the weight is laid on the different &s;liders, the &s;pring will &s;upport it on the top of one, on being bent very little; whereas, if laid on the other, the &s;pring will be bent very con&s;iderably. If then the ela&s;tic force of the &s;pring, be the mea&s;ure of the weight of the body, we have here a piece of lead apparently heavier and lighter than it&s;elf. The proportion in this in&s;tance is ju&s;t as two to one, but it might be encrea&s;ed as an hundred to one.</P>
<P>You &s;eem &s;urprized, Gentlemen, but there is no ab&s;urdity, no contradiction in all this. The weight of bodies, as e&s;timated by the ballance, is as before ob&s;erved merely comparative; their weight as e&s;timated by the re&s;i&s;tance of a &s;pring is real; and there is no more rea&s;on why the real and comparative weight of bodies &s;hould be equal, than why their &s;pecific weights &s;hould be &s;o too, which are univer&s;ally admitted to differ. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, when the weight is laid on one &s;lider, the &s;pring acts again&s;t its real weight; when on the other, again&s;t its comparative weight. The matter, if you will, may be called para|doxical; but &s;o was for a long time the equality between the comparative weight of a heavy body at the end of a &s;hort lever and a light one at the end of a long lever.</P>
<P>This equilibrium between bodies &s;o &s;ituated, that in other circum&s;tances are of different weights, was for ages looked upon as a kind of miracle in mecha|nics;
<PB N="30" REF="35">
though, now we are we are better acquainted with the laws of gravitation and motion, it would be miraculous if it were otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>It is every day experienced, with the common &s;teel-yard, that one pound at the end of ten inches from the centre of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, is comparatively of equal weight to ten pound at the end of one inch.</P>
<P>The difference between the real and comparative weight or gravitating force of a body, will appear yet more plainly, if we &s;uppo&s;e that the body, in&s;tead of barely pre&s;&s;ing the &s;pring, &s;hould fall from any height perpendicularly down upon it. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a weight of four pound to fall from the height of four feet. As the &s;pace de&s;cribed by falling bodies is as the &s;quare of their velocity, it will in falling four feet acquire two degrees of velocity, and of cour&s;e being four pound bend the &s;pring with eight degrees of force; which is in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;e the real momentum of the motion acquired by its gravitating force in falling that di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Now it is well known that, it would require exactly the &s;ame force to throw the &s;ame body up again in the &s;ame time to the &s;ame height. But it is as well known that the weight of one pound, and ever &s;o little more, at the end of a ballance beam of &s;ixteen feet, would weigh up four pound to the height of four feet, from which it fell.&mdash;It is equally as well known and certain that, if one pound be freely let fall &s;ixteen feet, it will acquire but four degrees of velocity, and of cour&s;e have acquired but four degrees of momentum by its gravitating force; which is but half the force of the greater weight; which neverthele&s;s it counterballances both in motion and at re&s;t: the effects of the comparative gravity therefore of the two weights, is in this ca&s;e equal, while tho&s;e of their real gravity differ as two to one.</P>
<P>It is on the mechanical advantages to be taken of this difference between the real and relative weight of bodies that the perpetual motion is founded. It is in fact nothing more than the weighing a heavy body up by a &s;mall comparative weight, and letting it fall with its own real weight: while, on the other hand, the light body ri&s;es with its real weight and falls with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> comparative weight:
<PB N="31" REF="36">
by which means a force may be gained on gravity, at every ri&s;e and fall, pro|portional to the difference between the real weight of both.</P>
<P>To explain more fully the difference between the ela&s;ticity and weight of bodies, on which both the theory and practice of all mechanic powers depend; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to recur to the action of the primary elements; who&s;e ela&s;ti|city I have endeavoured to illu&s;trate; by imputing their action to the exertion of a power in a &s;piral form.</P>
<P>The &s;piral indeed is u&s;ually con&s;idered in phy&s;icks, like the circle, as a compo&s;ition of imperceptibly &s;mall right lines. But the difference is obvious. Let us &s;uppo&s;e for in&s;tance, the periphery of a circle to have real exi&s;tence, and to be divi&s;ible; every divided &s;egment of that circle would de&s;cribe the &s;ame curve as the whole: that is, it would have the &s;ame property or bear the &s;ame geometrical relation to a right line, of the &s;ame length, as the whole circle would to a right line of its whole length. It is otherwi&s;e with the &s;piral.</P>
<P>For, &s;uppo&s;e it divi&s;ible into parts, as in the ca&s;e of the periphery of a circle, every part of it would be a different kind of curve. They would not each bear the &s;ame geometrical relation to a right line proportional to their length.</P>
<P>A &s;piral indeed may with greater propriety be called the generative part of a line, than a line it&s;elf: as the phy&s;ical elements may be, in like manner, more properly called extending than extended; the elements of exten&s;ion rather than ex|tended elements; as will appear from conceiving the di&s;tance between any two mathematical points de&s;cribed by &s;piral motion. The moving object would not, in any part of that di&s;tance, move in the line of direction between tho&s;e two points. But, if they lay ea&s;t and we&s;t, it would move in all directions of the compa&s;s, in moving ever &s;o little ea&s;tward or we&s;tward in that line. If the line were ea&s;tward it would move we&s;tward fir&s;t, as well as northward and Southward; and, if we&s;tward vice ver&s;&acirc;; becau&s;e it mu&s;t de&s;cribe a circle round the point, from which it moves, before it arrives at the point to which it is moving. Hence it is plain that each &s;uch element, circum&s;cribing its centre on all &s;ides, will con&s;titute an indivi&s;ible, incommenfutable, ela&s;tic, &s;pherical form; who&s;e diameter, if I may &s;o call it, will be le&s;s than any phy&s;ical right
<PB N="32" REF="37">
line whatever. Becau&s;e a right line being divi&s;ible, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity com|prehend at lea&s;t three mathematical points, a beginning, a middle and end. But a primary element de&s;cribing only the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tance between two, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;till le&s;s.</P>
<P>Every actual motion, is, as I have &s;aid, recti-linear, though not every action. The undequaque re&s;i&s;tance, or ela&s;ticity of matter, is the effect of its &s;piral action; its change of place in any particular direction is the effect of &s;ome partial reaction, or impul&s;e and is its motion.</P>
<P>An elementary power may act &s;pirally from a point, though it cannot move, or change its place, but in a right line. Its dimen&s;ions al&s;o, in con&s;equence of &s;uch actions being exerted uniformly round its centre, would a&s;&s;ume a &s;phe|rical form; and, though its contraction and dilatation &s;hould be effected, as in the ca&s;e of a watch &s;pring, &s;pirally, and not in a diver&s;ity of right lines, eman|ing in different directions from &s;uch centre; yet the reaction of &s;uch elements, or the re&s;i&s;tance they would make to each other, would be exerted in &s;uch right lines from and to the centres of each.</P>
<P>Such elements al&s;o might thus act and react, and yet be perfectly indifferent either to re&s;t or motion. Their mere change of place in any particular direc|tion, would not at all interfere with their internal action; or their mutual re|actions with the action of each other. At the &s;ame time that their undequaque re&s;i&s;tance, or reaction, would be &s;till the &s;ame whether in motion or at re&s;t; as we find indeed to be univer&s;ally the ca&s;e with all bodies.</P>
<P>Again, every &s;uch power might &s;o act independently of any other; &s;o that, as we can form no idea of the exi&s;tence of a power that does not act, we hence avoid the ab&s;urdity of admitting pa&s;&s;ive powers, and negative properties in phy&s;icks.</P>
<P>The propriety of the di&s;tinction between action and motion appears hence al|&s;o, more evident; in that each &s;ingle element might act of it&s;elf, by virtue of its inherent power or principle of activity; whereas it is impo&s;&s;ible that motion can be generated among &s;imple elements, without a partial inequality in the
<PB N="33" REF="38">
reactions of two or more &s;uch elements; or propagated among compound bodies without the equal and contrary motion of at lea&s;t two &s;uch bodies.</P>
<P>Mr. Locke, indeed, calls motion, action; and &s;ays there are but two &s;pe|cies of action; motion and thinking; and talks of the po&s;&s;ibility of a capacity of thinking being annexed to &s;imple, inert matter.</P>
<P>Dr. Stewart, on the other hand, though he ab&s;olutely rejects, on the au|thority of Clarke and Wolla&s;ton, the latter notion, as well as the more plau|&s;ible opinion of Hobbes, that a kind of ob&s;cure &s;en&s;e or perception is inherent in all matter; yet conceives, that a power of beginning motion &s;eems nece&s;&s;a|rily to infer a power of thinking. At the &s;ame time, however, he admits that, for ought we know, there may exi&s;t &s;ome &s;pecies of thinking beings, de&s;titute of the power of motion altogether. Oy&s;ters, in particular he ob&s;erves, have very little of this power. But might we not a&s;k this learned profe&s;&s;or, how he knows that they have the power of thinking in a greater degree than that of motion? For my own part, I mu&s;t own, I have no great opinion of the intellectual abilities of an oy&s;ter: nay, though it were the mo&s;t &s;agacious of a whole barrel; and that the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible that ever came from Colche&s;ter. I could almo&s;t as readily impute ingenuity to vegetables and fo&s;&s;iles; to the &s;en|&s;itive plant and the load&s;tone; as meditation to mu&s;cles or cogitabundity to cockles, periwinkles and rock oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>Neither Mr. Locke nor Dr. Stewart, did, in this particular, di&s;tingui&s;h with their u&s;ual accuracy. It is foreign to our purpo&s;e, or it would be ea&s;y to prove that, whether thinking be properly termed an action or not, it cannot be the action of a &s;imple uncompounded &s;ub&s;tance; and &s;till le&s;s is it the immediate cau&s;e of motion. We are led into this error from our very naturally attributing intelligence to the great fir&s;t cau&s;e. But, though we are obliged to make u&s;e of the &s;ame terms, to expre&s;s wi&s;dom and de&s;ign in the deity as in our&s;elves, intelligence divine and human mu&s;t differ as much as cau&s;e and effect. For high as the heavens are above the earth, are his thoughts above our thoughts; his ways above our ways. One e&s;&s;ential difference at lea&s;t, is evident in the thoughts of the creature and the creator. The de&s;ign of a created being deter|mines only the mode in which it will exert the phy&s;ical power, whether of
<PB N="34" REF="39">
ela&s;ticity or weight, that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in common with inanimate bodies of the &s;ame quantity of both. But the de&s;ign of the creator carries with it the immediate power of execution to any degree. The de&s;ign of the creator is his fiat, his fiat the execution of his will, whatever it be, it is no &s;ooner de&s;igned than it is done. The creature, however ingenious, may form projects and de|&s;igns innumerable beyond his powers of execution. The human imagination may form ideas; but mere ideas are all it can form. The will of the deity is omnipotent it hath made a material univer&s;e of immen&s;e momentum and moves gravitating worlds through ela&s;tic media with amazing velocity; the will of man cannot create a material atom, or give motion even to the go&s;&s;amer that idles in the wanton &s;ummer air. So weak humanity!</P>
<P>Lord Kaims makes no di&s;tinction between action and motion; but con&s;iders motion as a continued action; and controverts the capacity of inert matter to pre&s;erve a motion once impre&s;&s;ed on it. But in illu&s;trating this, he contra|dicts known experience. When the cau&s;e of motion cea&s;es, &s;ays he, we &s;eek no other cau&s;e for the cea&s;ing of the motion. Walking or running requires a continued exertion of power. It requires no exertion of power to put an end to the&s;e motions.</P>
<P>Dr. Stewart, on the contrary, oppo&s;es this doctrine; and very ju&s;tly defends the continuation of motion, on the Newtonian principle of the vis inertiae, or the indifference of matter to motion and re&s;t. But a man who &s;hould walk, or run with any con&s;iderable degree of velocity, particularly down-hill, will want no authority to be convinced that it does require a con&s;iderable effort to put a &s;top to his motion. He does not &s;top the moment he cea&s;es to exert his power to move forward; but mu&s;t exert a contrary power and that for &s;ome time before he will cea&s;e to move. If during that time he throws his legs for|ward, it is only to keep him&s;elf upright, and prevent his falling on his no&s;e; not to carry the center of gravity of his body forward, but rather to throw it backward.</P>
<P>Motion, on the other hand, &s;ays the la&s;t mentioned philo&s;opher is not action; but the effect of an action; and pertinently a&s;ks, Why may not an active be|ing communicate motion to matter, without moving it&s;elf? Judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erv|ing,
<PB N="35" REF="40">
that, whether the agent it&s;elf moves or not, it mu&s;t have a power of acting, previous to all motion; otherwi&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible for matter, or any other being, to begin motion of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have already an&s;wered his que&s;tion, by &s;hewing the impo&s;&s;ibility of com|municating motion to &s;olid matter by mere impul&s;e. And as to his ob&s;er|vation, we may, in our turn, ob&s;erve, that no finite created being, whether &s;olid or fluid, active or inactive, animate or inanimate, can begin to move of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Motion, as he truly a&s;&s;erts, is the effect of action; but it is only a &s;econdary effect. The motion of any individual is not the direct and &s;ole effect of the action of that individual. Two active elements may, by their mutual re&s;i&s;tance or reaction, put each other in motion; but the reaction of the one, is reciprocally and jointly the cau&s;e of the motion of the other; and not the &s;imple action of either. Nor is this all. There mu&s;t be &s;ome inequality in their mutual re&s;i&s;t|ance, ari&s;ing either from the inequality of their own den&s;ity, or that of the am|bient medium; otherwi&s;e neither would move.</P>
<P>The fore-finger of my right hand, pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t that of my left, will put it in motion; provided there be any inequality in their mutual pre&s;&s;ure, but if they pre&s;s each other equally; that is, if their reactions be equal; being in oppo&s;ite directions, no motion of either en&s;ues, with what&s;oever force they may pre&s;s again&s;t each other: Motion being ever generated in the direction of the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Motion therefore is not the direct effect of the &s;imple action of any &s;ingle individual; or even the equal reactions of two; but of a partial and tempo|rary inequality in the re&s;i&s;tance or reaction of two or more.</P>
<P>This will appear &s;till more clearly, on adverting to the propagation of mo|tion among palpable bodies. The&s;e are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed, on this occa&s;ion, into animate and inanimate; the animate body being &s;uppo&s;ed capable, by vir|tue of its con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or power of thinking, to begin motion of it&s;elf, and the inanimate only of continuing the motion given it.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41">But though I impute that phy&s;ical action, which is the primary generative cau&s;e of motion, to the con&s;tant exertion of an univer&s;al, metaphy&s;ical cau&s;e; to the great creator and governor of the univer&s;e; though I do not join with Hobbes or Leibnitz, in imputing con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or intelligence to monades or phy|&s;ical atoms, it does not by any means appear to me than even animated bodies are capable of originally generating motion in and of them&s;elves. Indeed we di&s;tin|gui&s;h an animate from an inanimate body, only by its apparently-voluntary or in|voluntary motion. If all its motions are the &s;imple and obvious effect of &s;ome other body moving it, we &s;ay it is inanimate and its motion is called involun|tary. If they are more complicated, and we do not &s;ee into the motives of its change of place, we &s;ay it is animated; its motion is voluntary, and we im|pute to it a capacity of thinking. Dr. Hill tells us, in &s;peaking of micro|&s;copical ob&s;ervations, and I dare &s;ay, he tells us truly, that certain late philo&s;ophers of the royal &s;ociety, hence mi&s;took the &s;eeds of a certain plant for living in&s;ects. On the &s;ame grounds it was, that the Mexicans mi&s;|took the Spani&s;h &s;hips when they fir&s;t approached their coa&s;t, for huge fi&s;h or &s;ea-mon&s;ters ri&s;ing out of the ocean; as for the like rea&s;on the Indian-of-the-lakes took the fir&s;t watch, he &s;aw, for a demon or the familiar of a conjurer.</P>
<P>But the motion of a body, as I have before hinted, is not immechanical, merely becau&s;e we cannot explore its mechani&s;m. Even voluntary motion it&s;elf is imputed to &s;ome motive. A man does not move this way or that without &s;ome inducing cau&s;e; and, whether it be metaphy&s;ical and mental, or mechanical and material, is determined only from its apparent modus operandi: by its producing its effect by means of the internal organs of con|ception and reflection, or the external organs of &s;en&s;ation and motion. The one may be anatomized; the other eludes di&s;&s;ection; but we neither know nor can know that there is any e&s;&s;ential difference in their mode of action.</P>
<P>Nothing however is more certain than that animals do not move merely be|cau&s;e they have a capacity of feeling, thinking, and willing; though perhaps they may feel, think and will, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that they are capacitated to move. Even Dr. Stewart admits that, though a power of beginning motion &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily to infer a power of thinking, we cannot inver&s;ely affirm that a power of thinking mu&s;t infer a power of beginning motion.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="42">The anatomi&s;ts agree that, in the voluntary motion of the limbs of ani|mals, the influence of their will &s;erves only to turn the &s;cale, if I may &s;o term it, between two mechanic powers, vibrating in equilibrio; as the mu&s;cles, &s;erving for voluntary motion, have each its antagoni&s;t; and would be in a &s;tate of perpetual contraction, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tronge&s;t exertion of the will, were it not for the equipollent libration of the&s;e antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>But let thought or de&s;ign proceed from what it may; whether it be, or not, the action of any particular &s;ub&s;tance; it is not the generative cau&s;e of motion, any more than motion, as Colden and others have conceived, is an in|herent quality in any thing. The motion of a thing is a temporary and adven|titious circum&s;tance, and not a mode of exi&s;tence or con&s;tant e&s;&s;ential pro|perty of any &s;imple being. Even as to palpable bodies, 'tis plain, they may be now at motion and now at re&s;t, and &s;ometimes in a &s;tate between both; as they are in the propagation and communication of motion by percu&s;&s;ion; du|ring which interval, the direction and velocity of the motion is generated by the percu&s;&s;ion and repercu&s;&s;ion of their component parts. For, however uncom|mon may be the ob&s;ervation, that bodies are &s;ometimes neither in a &s;tate of motion nor re&s;t, but between both; it is very true, con&s;idering them, as they are, compounds and individuals at the &s;ame time. Were they perfectly &s;olid and &s;imple indeed, they could not: they mu&s;t be in motion or at re&s;t; but being compounded, there mu&s;t be &s;ome time, however &s;mall, between the moment in which their parts are &s;truck with a certain velocity on one &s;ide, and the motion of their parts with a different velocity on the other; during this inter|val the body is neither wholly in motion nor wholly at re&s;t: an interval very perceptible in the colli&s;ion of compound ela&s;tic bodies; and, as I have &s;aid, we know not that bodies perfectly hard and unela&s;tic exi&s;t in nature. Admitting even the exi&s;tence of &s;uch bodies, motion could be no more communicated from one to another, in the manner it is, by percu&s;&s;ion, than, as I have before &s;hewn, they could originally receive it by &s;imple impul&s;e. For, being indifferent equally to motion and re&s;t, the &s;olid at re&s;t, impelled by another in motion, would either change its place, with infinite velocity, or move forward in the &s;ame direction with the &s;ame velocity.&mdash;But this is not the ca&s;e. The mo|mentum of the motion is divided between the two bodies; which if equal, move on after colli&s;ion with only half the velocity of the fir&s;t mover. This divi&s;ion,
<PB N="38" REF="43">
therefore, is effected by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive action and reaction of the parts of the two bodies; by which means tho&s;e of one are impeded in their motion, as much as tho&s;e of the other are impelled to move.</P>
<P>It is admitted, indeed, that the action and reaction of the &s;pecific parts of palpable bodies con&s;i&s;ts of actual motion. It may therefore be pertinently a&s;ked, how the&s;e, if once repelled, are brought to move forward again in the direc|tion of the impelling body? I an&s;wer, by the repul&s;ion of the medium in which they exi&s;t, and by virtue of which they cohere.&mdash;For it is to be ob&s;erved that the gravity or weight of bodies, though always proportional to their quantity of re&s;i&s;tance, is not proportional to their ela&s;ticity or the number of primary ela&s;tic elements contained within their dimen&s;ions. On the contrary, the hea|vie&s;t and harde&s;t body in nature, will contain the fewe&s;t ela&s;tic particles in its compo&s;ition: &s;o that in the centre of a &s;econdary element, generated by motion, the harde&s;t, heavie&s;t and mo&s;t impenetrable of all bodies, there would be a va|cuum almo&s;t as perfect as that &s;uppo&s;ed by the Newtonians, in mere &s;pace.</P>
<P>For I &s;hall prove mechanically to be true, what Sir I&s;aac Newton &s;ugge&s;ted that the aether or the ela&s;tic medium is the den&s;e&s;t, where there are the fewe&s;t and lighte&s;t palpable &s;olids.</P>
<P>But this I &s;hall explain more fully, when I come to &s;hew, why the parts of bodies gravitate and cohere; and how the re&s;i&s;tance, which ari&s;es merely from ela&s;ticity or action in the primary elements, is &s;upplied by motion in the &s;e|condary ones.&mdash;But to return&mdash;Though a contender for the perpetual motion, I am &s;o far from being an advocate for what may be &s;trictly called &s;elf-mo|tion, that I do affirm no finite created being whatever is capable of &s;uch &s;elf-motion. Even the mo&s;t nimble animal in the creation, exert what force it will, cannot move an inch without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other body; which in its turn mu&s;t be moved by it equally in a contrary direction.</P>
<P>This is a certain and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the mechanical principle of action and reaction, prevailing throughout all nature: The univer&s;al equali|ty of this action and reaction in oppo&s;ite directions, being it&s;elf the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of bodies being compo&s;ed of, and moving in, an ela&s;tic medium.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="44">This is a critical point, Gentlemen; and, I own, I do not expect you will readily give up your privilege, of &s;elf-motion; or conde&s;cend to think your|&s;elves obliged to &s;tocks and &s;tones for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in moving your&s;elves. And yet, humiliating as may be the reflection, man, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate is &s;o incumbered with matter, and &s;o dependent on the objects about him, that he cannot &s;tir a foot without them.

<P>Profe&s;&s;or Stewart, whom I have &s;o often quoted, talks, indeed, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, of a man's giving him&s;elf a pu&s;h, when he wants to go forward; and tells us that the common account of the progre&s;&s;ive motion of animals, as given by Borelli, and admitted by mo&s;t other authors, is too conci&s;e, if not fal&s;e; videlicet, that in walking, flying, or &s;wimming, the animal acts upon the ground, air, or water, in one direction; and that the reaction of the me|dium carries the animal forward, in another direction.</P>
<P>This theory, adopted by Sir I&s;aac Newton and almo&s;t all experimental phi|lo&s;ophers, is controverted by the profe&s;&s;or; who tells us, on the other hand, that the only immediate cau&s;e of the motion, is the active force of the animal; which pre&s;&s;es the medium one way and its own body another. But were this the ca&s;e, it is evident, on the very face of the propo&s;ition, that the &s;ame body might actively tend to one &s;ide, and al&s;o actively tend to the other, at the &s;ame time.&mdash;This the profe&s;&s;or him&s;elf allows to be a contradiction in terms. A man indeed may, with one hand, pre&s;s again&s;t one object in one direction; and with the other again&s;t another in a contrary direction, and may move both:
<PB N="40" REF="45">
but, if their re&s;i&s;tance to his pre&s;&s;ure be equal, he him&s;elf will not move, or be moved at all. And, if unequal, he would be moved, like every other body, in the direction of lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. If a man could move, or change his place, merely of him&s;elf, he could of him&s;elf put an end to any motion into which he might be put. But this we find impo&s;&s;ible. A man hurried along by a force &s;uperior to his own, cannot &s;top him&s;elf, till he meets with &s;ome ob&s;tacle of greater re&s;i&s;tance; a &s;tone, po&s;t, or a brick-wall, for in&s;tance; by who&s;e friendly aid he might be &s;topped.</P>
<P>A philo&s;opher falling from the top of a hou&s;e, with all his &s;agacity, re&s;olu|tion and activity, cannot &s;top him&s;elf, at lea&s;t now the &s;ign irons are taken away, till he comes to the ground.&mdash;I have indeed heard of a man, who once under|took to jump off the monument, for a wager; but when half way down, found he could not do it; &s;lunk up again and yielded the wager lo&s;t.</P>
<P>You may &s;mile, Gentlemen, but unle&s;s any of you will avouch the truth of this &s;tory, I cannot admit that, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, any of you can actually move your&s;elves. It is pretty obvious, in the ca&s;e of leaping, dancing and jumping, that we do not altogether move our&s;elves. To in&s;tance only the &s;imple ca&s;e of the tight rope: let the dancer cut the &s;ame capers if he can, by pre&s;&s;ing his feet in the &s;ame manner and with the &s;ame force again&s;t an in|flexible rod of iron. Would he be able, think you, to &s;pring &s;o high? And yet, if our motion be the immediate and &s;ole effect of our own activity; Why not?</P>
<P>It may be imagined that when a man holds out his arm at length, that it is done merely by a &s;imple and &s;ingle act of volition.&mdash;Not &s;o.&mdash; It is rai&s;ed, per|haps by a &s;ingle act of the will, determining the direction of lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance among the equilibrating mu&s;cles; but it mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained by repeated acts of volition; that keep the &s;u&s;taining mu&s;cles and their antagoni&s;ts in con&s;tant vi|bration; or it would de&s;cend in the direction of gravity.</P>
<P>Hence we &s;ee that animals cannot &s;upport even the weight of their own limbs, for a length of time, without fatigue and wearine&s;s. And hence the rea&s;on and evident u&s;e of re&s;t and &s;leep; to give the fibres of the mu&s;cles

time to recover their ela&s;ticity, when their tone is too much relaxed by vi|gilance and labour. All this is merely mechanical.</P>
<P>So very mechanical, indeed, is the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of animal motion, that I &s;hould not wonder if &s;ome ingenious arti&s;t, ver&s;ed in the practical expedients of machinery, &s;hould, under the direction of a Cox, or a Pinchbeck, contrive an inanimate automaton, that might be led about the room by a boy, as a blind beggar is about the &s;treets by a dog and a &s;tring.</P>
<P>That &s;ceptical &s;mile, Gentlemen, carries with it, a Credat Judaeus Apella. And yet it is certain no greater exertion of animal power would be required, than ju&s;t to incline the centre of the automaton's gravity in the line of direc|tion, and at the &s;ame time to throw one leg forward to keep it from falling, and pre&s;s the other downwards to rai&s;e the centre of gravity; and this the weight of the boy might be able to perform by pulling at the end of a &s;tring. Nay, we often &s;ee live animals &s;o pulled along even again&s;t their inclination; but their centre of gravity being drawn forward, they are obliged to move their legs or fall down; in the mean while they are dragged on by the action of the body pulling them, as much as a cart is by the hor&s;es; the motion of the legs in one ca&s;e and the wheels in the other, &s;erving only to keep the centre of gravity from falling.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, Gentlemen, that, in&s;tead of &s;itting upon common chairs, the weight of your bodies were &s;u&s;tained by ela&s;tic &s;prings: if, in order to ri&s;e, you were to pre&s;s with the &s;edentary mu&s;cles again&s;t &s;uch &s;prings, as forcibly as you would again&s;t a chair, you would not only be thrown up into an erect po&s;ture, but would be tumbled forward on your faces upon the carpet.</P>
<P>But it may be nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate this matter &s;till farther; as more de|pends on it, re&s;pecting the perpetuity of communicated motion, than may at fir&s;t be imagined.</P>
<P>Lord Kaims, who too readily admits, on the fallacious evidence of a &s;ingle &s;en&s;e, that an animal may move it&s;elf; argues, in order to prove it, again&s;t the univer&s;al equality of action and reaction, and objects to Sir I&s;aac Newton's il|lu&s;tration
<PB N="42" REF="47">
of it: &s;aying we &s;hould make a di&s;tinction between moveable and im|moveable ob&s;tacles. But no &s;uch di&s;tinction really exi&s;ts. Motion, as it is not the e&s;&s;ential property, or mode of exi&s;tance, of any &s;imple &s;ub&s;tance; &s;o neither is it the durable &s;tate of any &s;uch &s;ub&s;tance. The object, indeed, which is re|&s;i&s;ted on all &s;ides, is, &s;o long as it is &s;o equally re&s;i&s;ted, at re&s;t. But all phy|&s;ical ob&s;tacles are not only moveable, but in actual motion: their re&s;t is only relative. Bodies equally re&s;i&s;ted on all &s;ides, or tho&s;e moving with the &s;ame velocity the &s;ame way, are indeed at re&s;t, with re&s;pect to each other: though with re&s;pect to another combination or &s;y&s;tem of bodies, they may be in mo|tion with prodigious velocity. With regard to each other, Gentlemen, and the apparently immoveable objects about you; &s;o long as you remain in any particular place, you are relatively at re&s;t; and yet nothing is more certain than that the room it&s;elf, with all that are in it, is moved by the diurnal revo|lution of the earth many thou&s;and miles in a minute.</P>
<P>This every body knows, and yet almo&s;t every body inadvertently concludes, that men are at re&s;t, when they are not put in motion by them&s;elves, or &s;ome other animated being: the ob&s;tacle, indeed, is called immoveable when, being apparently at re&s;t, its quantity of matter is prodigiou&s;ly great, in proportion to that by which it is pu&s;hed, or pulled, drawn or impelled: becau&s;e in that ca&s;e, its velocity is comparatively &s;o &s;low as to be imperceptible; the force of the action and reaction being in all ca&s;es equal; which it would not be, if the velocity of the motion were not always reciprocally as the quantity of the mov|ing matter.</P>
<P>Hence the famous po&s;ition, drawn as a corollary from that of the vis in|ertiae, or indifference of matter to motion and re&s;t; viz. that the leg of a fly moves the whole globe of the earth.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance, however, has the common fault of familiar illu&s;trations. It does not fully apply; as it would do, if the globe of the earth were a perfect|ly &s;olid body. For an ob&s;tacle may al&s;o be called immoveable (as it is to all intents and purpo&s;es equally &s;o re&s;pecting the moving body) when, being of the &s;ame weight, it meets it with the &s;ame velocity in a contrary direc|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="48">It &s;tops the body as much in one ca&s;e as the other, and is therefore an equal ob&s;tacle to its motion. The putting a &s;top to any motion, by moving in an oppo&s;ite direction before colli&s;ion, requires the &s;ame force and is in effect the &s;ame thing, as moving a contrary way after colli&s;ion. The various motions therefore of the component parts of the earth in a contrary direction, prevent the fly's actually moving the whole.</P>
<P>It has been often remarked, by writers on this &s;ubject, that the animate body differs from the inanimate, with re&s;pect to motion; in that the thinking being can determine the quantity of its motion, on any occa&s;ion. But this is true only to a certain degree. An animal indeed may exert his power in various degrees, within that of its own weight, and the weight it is capable of &s;u&s;taining; but no farther. It might divide and diver&s;ify the direction or tendency of that power; but it cannot encrea&s;e its momentum, or exert as much more force on any occa&s;ion as it will. When we &s;ee a waggoner belabouring a poor hor&s;e, to make him draw a weight, which he is incapable of &s;tirring: The Brute (I don't mean the hor&s;e) &s;eems to think, with &s;uch philo&s;ophers, that the animal can exert as much power as he plea&s;es. But he finds the contrary, while the will|ing bea&s;t is cruelly loaden with &s;tripes, for &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tubbornne&s;s or &s;loth; when his only fault is the want of food to fill his belly, by which he might ac|quire a little more fle&s;h on his back. Animal re&s;olution is not a mechanic power. An animal without weight, how great &s;oever its good will, would not be able to lift, or draw a &s;ingle feather.</P>
<P>The objections indeed which have been &s;tarted to the univer&s;al equality be|tween the action and reaction of bodies, have taken their ri&s;e chiefly from the defective manner in which it has been illu&s;trated.</P>
<P>Thus it has been &s;aid that, when a hor&s;e draws along a &s;tone, the &s;tone draws the hor&s;e backward with a force equal to that with which the hor&s;e draws the &s;tone forwards.</P>
<P>To this it has been objected, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Dr. Stewart. See Edinburg E&s;&s;ays</NOTE> that "nothing more can be meant by it than that the hor&s;e lo&s;es as much force as the &s;tone gains; and that with re&s;pect to the hor&s;e the effect is the &s;ame as if there was no &s;tone tied behind him; but
<PB N="44" REF="49">
that he was pu&s;hed back with a force equal to that acquired by the &s;tone. The active force of the hor&s;e's limbs pre&s;&s;es forwards, it is &s;aid, both the hor&s;e and the &s;tone; what is called the reaction of the &s;tone is not equal to the whole force exerted by the hor&s;e; for then indeed there could be no progre&s;&s;ion, it is only equal to what is impre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;tone."</P>
<P>But the truth is that neither the illu&s;tration nor the objection are applicable to the point. As to the fir&s;t, in pulling or drawing, we do not directly act, or impre&s;s any motion, on the thing pulled or drawn, as in pu&s;hing or thru&s;t|ing. In the ca&s;e of the hor&s;e and the &s;tone; the hor&s;e acts only again&s;t the ground; and even in that not in a direction immediately contrary to that in which he moves. As to the &s;tone, it is entirely pa&s;&s;ive, and though it cannot help following the hor&s;e to which it is fa&s;tened, does not exert any action affect|ing its motion in any direction whatever. That the &s;everal parts of the ground, the hor&s;e, the rope, and the &s;tone, do reciprocally react on each other during the generation of the motion, I grant; for hence are its direction and velocity determined, but when the rope is &s;tretched to its utmo&s;t degree of ten&s;ion, both the hor&s;e and &s;tone move together as one body. The hor&s;e would cer|tainly move fa&s;ter without the &s;tone, as the &s;tone would lie at re&s;t without the hor&s;e; but for no other rea&s;on than that the &s;ame force of reaction could not move a ma&s;s equal to both, with the &s;ame velocity as it would move either.</P>
<P>In like manner, it is &s;aid, that when a per&s;on in a boat pulls a rope, which is fa&s;tened to the &s;hore; the man acts upon the &s;hore in one direction, and that the &s;hore, by its reaction in the oppo&s;ite direction, pulls the man and boat to|wards it.</P>
<P>To this it is al&s;o, in the &s;ame manner, objected that it is evidently the force of the man extending him&s;elf that draws the &s;hore, with his hands, one way, and at the &s;ame time pu&s;hes the ve&s;&s;el with equal force, with his feet, the oppo&s;ite way.</P>
<P>In reply to this it may be &s;aid that, though a man by extending him&s;elf, as profe&s;&s;or Stewart terms it, might pu&s;h bodies in different directions from him, it can only be by contracting him&s;elf or by moving in a contrary direction he can draw any thing toward him. He thinks no man can &s;eriou&s;ly maintain "that
<PB N="45" REF="50">
the &s;hore can draw the man in the boat," yet tells us that the man in the boat really draws the &s;hore. But the &s;hore is certainly as much at re&s;t, as it is in|active. The truth is, that drawing and pulling are popular and unphilo&s;ophical terms; they expre&s;s rather the concomitant effect, than the cau&s;e of motion; which is originally generated by direct repul&s;ion and not by indirect attraction. Nothing can act where it is not: the man is at a di&s;tance from the &s;hore and neither of them acts upon the other. When the man pulls the rope indeed, the &s;hore, the man, and the boat, are all one body: and neither act nor react on each other. The immediate cau&s;e of the motion of the boat, is the action of the boat on the water, and the reaction of the water again&s;t the boat; the in|equality of which determines the boat to move on the &s;ide of lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. This is plain, for a man with the &s;trength of Samp&s;on might not be able with his hands to draw either the &s;hore to him, or with his feet to pu&s;h the boat to the &s;hore, again&s;t an oppo&s;ing tide or current. Were the reactions of the boat and the water equal, the activity of the man would no more move the boat, than if he were &s;itting at one end of it, and that activity were exerted in pulling a rope fa&s;tened to the other: while on the other hand, if they were unequal, and that of the current the greate&s;t, the boat would move, notwith&s;tanding all the man's pulling, in the direction of the current. So that, in&s;tead of taking in the rope with his hands, he mu&s;t let it out; or he would him&s;elf be pul|led overboard and fall into the &s;tream.</P>
<P>That the motions of the &s;tone, in one ca&s;e, and of the boat in the other, are not the only immediate effect of the action of the hor&s;e, or the man, will be farther evident from con&s;idering the manner in which the motion of the animal it&s;elf is generated.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is induced from &s;ome motive, either apparent or occult, to move. It mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity move one way&mdash;This direction is determined by the will, or the internal active power of the animal. But it does not actually move in con&s;equence of this determination. To put its de&s;ign in execution it mu&s;t pre&s;s again&s;t &s;ome other re&s;i&s;ting body. If it pre&s;s in a direction contrary to that of its intended motion, and its centre of gravity re&s;t on a &s;lippery &s;ur|face, it will, of cour&s;e, be moved by the reaction of the ob&s;tacle in the di|rection intended. Thus a man, &s;tanding on &s;kaits upon the ice, may, by pu&s;h|ing
<PB N="46" REF="51">
with his hands or feet again&s;t a re&s;i&s;ting ob&s;tacle, cau&s;e it to move him, or as it is called, move him&s;elf, a con&s;iderable while, in a direction contrary to that he pu&s;hed. But, in order to avoid the wear and tear of tender bodies moving on rough &s;urfaces, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;o much friction, na|ture has provided that the loco-motion of animals &s;hould be progre&s;&s;ive. It becomes nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that the centre of gravity &s;hould alternately ri&s;e and fall. A man may &s;lip or &s;lide, but he cannot walk or run, without rai&s;|ing his centre of gravity at every &s;tep, in order to give it an inclination of de|&s;cent in the direction of his motion.</P>
<P>This alternate ri&s;e and fall of the centre of gravity is effected by the pre&s;&s;ure of the foot, in an oblique direction again&s;t the ground, to rai&s;e the body, and by the de&s;cent of the body when rai&s;ed; during which the feet are alternately thrown forward to keep the animal from falling. Hence we &s;ee that its pro|gre&s;&s;ive motion in walking or running is &s;o far from being the only immediate effect of its own motion, that it is not even the &s;ole effect of the reaction of the medium on which it acts, but the joint effect of that reaction and the action of gravity; in the compound direction of both which it moves.</P>
<P>And hence we &s;ee the rea&s;on why in pulling and drawing, effected by the alternate motion of the hands or feet, the power of the animal is ever propor|tional to its weight and the weight it &s;u&s;tains. Thus in the ca&s;e of the boat, the force with which it would oppo&s;e the water, would be proportional to the weight of the man pulling the rope. So that a heavy man, equally willing and active, would pull the boat a-&s;hore, not only &s;ooner than a light one, but when a light one, of equal activity in proportion to his bulk, would not do it all. A light animal, be its &s;trength and activity what it will, cannot pull or draw &s;o great a weight as an heavy animal of the &s;ame activity.</P>
<P>A practical and u&s;eful conclu&s;ion may be inferred from hence, not only re&s;pecting the properties of the animals be&s;t adapted for different kinds of la|bour; but al&s;o the method of applying tho&s;e properties to the greate&s;t advan|tage: every animal being capable only of exerting a power proportional to its weight, and the weight it is capable of &s;upporting. It will, indeed, move its own limbs with an agility proportional to the ela&s;ticity of its mu&s;cles; but, cae|teris
<PB N="47" REF="52">
paribus, an heavy animal will always be &s;tronger, or capable of greater labour than a light one; and that in proportion to their difference of weight. Hence we &s;ee, al&s;o, why men exert their greate&s;t &s;trength, either in carrying burthens, or in working engines, where the whole weight of the body is employed.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the equality of action and reaction, has been as imper|fectly illu&s;trated, with regard to the more immediate cau&s;e of motion by impul&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, in rowing or pu&s;hing along a barge, or lighter, by means of a pole; it is commonly &s;aid the oars, in the one ca&s;e, act again&s;t, or upon, the water in one direction; while the water, reacting on the oars, in a contrary direction produce the motion of the boat. In the other ca&s;e, they &s;ay, that the reaction of the ground again&s;t the pole, makes the boat move. To the&s;e, it is object|ed, that the motion is in both ca&s;es intirely produced by the man, who&s;e ac|tive force is the only moving power. Profe&s;&s;or Stewart, &s;ays this, in contra|diction to Sir I&s;aac Newton.</P>
<P>As to the bu&s;ine&s;s of rowing, it is a compound action, con&s;i&s;ting of both pulling and pu&s;hing. A waterman pulls with one end of his oar, and pu&s;hes with the other. Not to take up your time unnece&s;&s;arily, therefore, as I have already explained the mechani&s;m of the former, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the latter, viz. his pu&s;hing a barge along with a pole. In this ca&s;e he exerts the the &s;ame force as if he walked by the &s;ide of the canal and dragged the boat after him. The only difference in the operation is that, in walking along the ground and pulling his boat along, the man moves con&s;tantly as fa&s;t as the boat, and may be con&s;idered as one body with it; being connected by the haw&s;er. Here the immediate cau&s;e of motion is the inequality between the re|action of the ground again&s;t one part of this compound body, and the oppo|&s;ite reaction of the water again&s;t another part of it: the generative force of the motion being &s;till merely the weight of the man. On the other hand, in pu&s;h|ing the barge, the man does not move always with the &s;ame velocity, though he mu&s;t be always con&s;idered as part of the &s;ame body. When he re&s;ts with his &s;houlder on his pole, he may be con&s;idered, likewi&s;e, together with the
<PB N="48" REF="53">
barge and pole, as one body with the ground; to which (notwith&s;tanding he moves his legs to keep him&s;elf from falling) he is attached, as well as to the barge; and does not move; though, by the action of his legs again&s;t the deck, the barge is partially moved from under him. When he takes up his pole, he is no longer one body with the ground, nor does he contribute to the motion of the barge. The immediate cau&s;e of which is, as before, the inequality be|tween the reactions of the ve&s;&s;el and the water, and the generative force merely the weight of the man, pre&s;&s;ing the ground, by means of the pole in one di|rection, and the water, by means of the barge, in another; in the compound of which two directions the barge moves; while the man him&s;elf de&s;cends in the line of gravity, and would fall flat on his face, if his centre were not re|peatedly rai&s;ed, by the alternate motion of his legs. Thus we &s;ee that, in this ca&s;e, as in the former, neither the illu&s;tration nor the objection are &s;trictly applicable.</P>
<P>That the action or voluntary motion of the man originally determines in both, the direction in which the boat is to move, is admitted. But, &s;o does that of the man at the helm, on board a &s;hip; and yet nobody pretends that a &s;hip is moved &s;olely by its pilot. The wind or tide is at lea&s;t equally nece&s;&s;ary. We are indeed our own pilots, Gentlemen; but, quo rapit tempe&s;tas&mdash;without a&s;&s;i&s;tance we can make no way, and even with it we cannot always make our own way.</P>
<P>On this con&s;ideration, though merely a mechanical one, I flatter my&s;elf with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to enable me to remove that enormous weight of public preju|dice, which prevails again&s;t the perpetual motion.</P>
<P>This, Gentlemen, I pre&s;ume to hope from your candour, as I have en|deavoured to make it appear, as well as a &s;ingle lecture would permit, that motion is the mechanical effect of the phy&s;ical action of the primary elements. That the direction of motion only comes within the province of animal intel|lect&mdash;That the vital &s;y&s;tem is &s;upported by mere mechanic motion; kept up by the ela&s;ticity of the &s;olids and the gravity of the fluids, compo&s;ing the ani|mal boody&mdash;That by the &s;ame means a more &s;imple inanimate &s;y&s;tem or ma|chine may be framed; which may have the &s;ame property of continued action (or, as it is called, &s;elf-motion) with the difference only of being incapable of
<PB N="49" REF="54">
thinking or diver&s;ifying its action. And this is all that is, or can be, expected of a perpetual motion; the momentum of which may, for the rea&s;ons before given, be encrea&s;ed to any degree, according to the weight of the bodies em|ployed, and the work required to be done.</P>
<P>If I have failed in any particular of giving conviction, a future lecture may probably elucidate what may &s;eem ob&s;cure in the pre&s;ent. In the mean time, I hope enough hath been &s;aid, to convince my auditors, that I have not ex|cited their attention to a &s;ubject I have not long con&s;idered; and that they will at lea&s;t conclude, in my favour, that a man of very moderate abilities may, during an inten&s;e application for fifteen or twenty years to one object, have taken a view of it in more lights, than the mo&s;t ingenious philo&s;opher may have done, by making it only a cur&s;ory and occa&s;ional object of his attention.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t beg leave to put an end to the fir&s;t part of my Lecture.</P>
<P>In my next (of which I &s;hall take the liberty to give you early notice) I &s;hall enter farther into the mechanical effects of motion: among which I place all the Phaenomena, great and &s;mall, of palpable bodies. Even their Ex|ten&s;ion, Gravitation, and Cohe&s;ion, with all their &s;pecific differences, as al&s;o their various appearances under different circum&s;tances, I propo&s;e to prove to be the mechanical effects of one general principle of all natural perpetual mo|tions; and that the very &s;ame on which I found my preten&s;ions to an artificial one: Indeed, if &s;uch principle did not, or &s;hould cea&s;e to, exi&s;t in nature, we our&s;elves, with all the objects around us,
<Q><L>Would, like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabrick of a vi&s;ion,</L>
<L>Melt into air, into thin air.</L>
<L>The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces,</L>
<L>The &s;olemn temples&mdash; the great globe it&s;elf</L>
<L>Yea, all which it inherit, would di&s;&s;olve,</L>
<L>And, like an in&s;ub&s;tantial pageant fading,</L>
<L>Leave not a wreck behind.</L></Q></P>
