<HEAD>LETTER XIX. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JUNE 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OH my dear friend, my a&s;toni&s;h|ment and joy are un&s;peakable. I had re|mained alone about half an hour, my mind di&s;tracted with a thou&s;and thoughts, when I was rou&s;ed from my reverie by hearing the great door below open; and condemning my&s;elf &s;everely for a gratifi|cation &s;o weak, dangerous, and improper, I ha&s;tily tried to compo&s;e my features, and ro&s;e to meet the company; when in&s;tead of the Heathcote family whom I had expected, Mr. Howard and my &s;i&s;ter entered, attended&mdash;conceive my a&s;toni&s;h|ment Sophia&mdash;by Roat&s;ley him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">After di&s;regarding your promi&s;e of waiting my return, Mi&s;s Seymour, cried he, probably you did not expect I &s;hould &s;o &s;oon make my appearance to reproach you: but though I believe I have &s;ome engagement or other with Brad&s;haw this evening, I found my&s;elf quite unable to with&s;tand Mrs. Howard's kind and pre&s;&s;|ing invitation to &s;up here. The remem|brance of the delightful evening I &s;pent at Dover (which I &s;hall ever regard as one of the happie&s;t of my life) renders the temptation wholly irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>His appearance did indeed agitate and &s;urpri&s;e me beyond mea&s;ure; nor could I conjecture how it had taken place, at &s;uch an hour and at a juncture &s;o unex|pected, till Fanny in a low voice con|trived to inform me, that in pur&s;uance of her projected plan of operations &s;he had deferred leaving the theatre as long as with propriety &s;he could, and indeed I &s;u&s;pect rather longer; for &s;he owned all
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the ladies were gone and only a few &s;trag|gling gentlemen continued to &s;aunter about. Captain Brad&s;haw, however, &s;till kept by her &s;ide; and Roat&s;ley returning, heard with evident marks of di&s;appoint|ment that I was already gone.</P>
<P>Perceiving my &s;i&s;ter's unaccountable delay, he naturally concluded that her carriage was not arrived, and politely a&s;ked leave to &s;ee after it. Fanny, more and more embarra&s;&s;ed, now beheld the total defeat of all her &s;ecret &s;chemes to avoid detection, and was at length obliged to confe&s;s that as the way was &s;o <HI>very &s;hort</HI> and the night &s;o <HI>very plea&s;ant</HI> &s;he thought walking by far the mo&s;t agreea|ble way of returning; after which decla|ration wi&s;hing Roat&s;ley a ha&s;ty good night, in hopes &s;he &s;hould get rid of all the gentlemen, &s;he quickly led the way, accompanied, added &s;he in a tone of cha|grin, by poor Mrs. Heathcote and the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
five children, all wrapt up like &s;o many Egyptian mummeys.</P>
<P>Roat&s;ley however, with a politene&s;s na|tural to him, followed, and offering his arm, begged &s;he would allow him the plea&s;ure of e&s;corting her part of the way. With great civility and a profu&s;ion of thanks, Mrs. Howard made violent re|&s;i&s;tance; but in vain; Roat&s;ley made his point good, and had attended her as far as the bottom of the hill when they were met by Mr. Howard, who could do no le&s;s you know than reque&s;t that he would walk forward and partake of a family &s;upper at Hubert Hill. To this, after &s;ome he&s;itation, he con&s;ented; and the par&s;on's family, having &s;een Fanny &s;afe under her hu&s;band's protection, very opportunely cho&s;e to excu&s;e them&s;elves from accompanying her farther, and jumped one after another over the &s;tyle which leads through the fields to the par|&s;onage.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">You cannot ea&s;ily conceive, Sophia, after the train of ideas which had pre|ceded his appearance, how &s;ingular and extraordinary it now appeared, when I recollected what pique and di&s;plea&s;ure his &s;ilence to Mr. Howard's letter had a few days before occa&s;ioned me. I could &s;carce believe he was now at Hubert Hill; and when I contra&s;ted his pre&s;ent flow of &s;pirits with his dejected a&s;pect two hours before, every thing appeared my&s;terious and unaccountable.</P>
<P>Were my dear, dear Sophia now pre|&s;ent, &s;aid I to my&s;elf more than once during the evening, &s;he would confe&s;s that blind partiality has not guided my pen in my repre&s;entation of this amiable young man.</P>
<P>When our repa&s;t was concluded, Mr. Howard and Fanny, charmed to per|ceive their gue&s;t to all appearance fully as much plea&s;ed with their company as they were delighted with his, both joined
<PB N="6" REF="7">
in entreating him to accept of a bed here. To this &s;ome &s;light objections in regard to inconvenience were on his part made, and ea&s;ily overruled by the good lady of the man&s;ion, who propo&s;ed di&s;patching Dubois to the village with orders to his &s;ervants and an apology to Mr. Brad|&s;haw; and in &s;hort he at length complied. The wine and fruits being placed on a &s;mall table before us, all ceremony and form &s;eemed entirely di&s;carded; and we chatted together with a &s;ocial familiarity and cheerfulne&s;s, which a long &s;eries of occa&s;ional meetings in town could never have produced. We were all in uncom|mon &s;pirits; and Fanny, in the giddi|ne&s;s of her mirth, let &s;everal little &s;allies of <HI>naivete</HI> e&s;cape her which &s;eemed ex|tremely to plea&s;e and amu&s;e her vi&s;itor. Chance has hitherto &s;o contrived it, that my &s;i&s;ter has &s;eldom or never been much the object of Mr. Roat&s;ley's attention; but he appeared this night to regard her
<PB N="7" REF="8">
in a point of view wholly new, and en|tered with much reli&s;h into the natural &s;implicity of her character.</P>
<P>As yet, however, nothing had been hinted relating to the propo&s;ed explana|tion. Had Roat&s;ley been tete a tete with any of the company, doubtle&s;s it would have been an ea&s;y matter to have led to the &s;ubject; but while the whole family were met together, to have enquired into particulars which from the agitation I had betrayed he could not but naturally conclude were of a very delicate nature, I doubt not mu&s;t have appeared a pre|&s;umption for which he could not &s;um|mon re&s;olution. Wholly un&s;u&s;picious be&s;ides how nearly he was him&s;elf inte|re&s;ted in the tale, all he could po&s;&s;ibly conjecture in regard to what he was to learn mu&s;t have been, that in gratitude for the obligation he had procured me, I thought it incumbent he &s;hould be made acquainted with certain circum&s;tances of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
my &s;ituation which he had rea&s;on to ap|prehend might prove a painful and not improbably a mortifying communication.</P>
<P>Silent therefore he continued on this topick, tho' mo&s;t amu&s;ing and agreeable on a thou&s;and others, till my &s;i&s;ter and I retired, which was not till after one in the morning, an hour unheard of in the &s;ober annals of Hubert Hill.</P>
<P>I did not &s;hut my eyes for many hours after I went to bed. The di&s;tant mur|mur of the two gentlemen's voices be|low, who did not &s;eparate till almo&s;t &s;un ri&s;e, engaged my con&s;tant attention; and a thou&s;and conjectures and reflections re|lating to the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation, entirely bani&s;hed all inclination to re&s;t till about my u&s;ual time of ri&s;ing, which at this &s;ea&s;on is &s;eldom after &s;ix. I then &s;lept for a couple of hours; but finding it &s;o late when I awoke, I ha&s;tily ro&s;e, and had but ju&s;t fini&s;hed dre&s;&s;ing, when Mr. Howard tapped at my chamber door
<PB N="9" REF="10">
reque&s;ting me to follow him into my &s;i&s;|ter's dre&s;&s;ing room.</P>
<P>Impatient beyond mea&s;ure to learn the &s;ub&s;tance of la&s;t night's conver&s;ation, I flew rather than run into the room, where I found Fanny almo&s;t as eager as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard then related circum&s;tan|tially and minutely every word that had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The moment we had left the parlour, Roat&s;ley addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. How|ard, &s;aid&mdash;to you, my dear Sir, I think it mu&s;t be wholly unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that to be but once in company with the amiable Mrs. Howard and her &s;i&s;ter without feeling the warme&s;t intere&s;t in their happine&s;s and the mo&s;t anxi|ous &s;olicitude to promote it to the utmo&s;t, is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible; that I have experienced the truth of this remark, I hope you do me the ju&s;tice to believe, and&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">Your conduct, Sir, interrupted Mr. Howard (to whom I had hinted the ta&s;k that was likely to devolve upon him) fully evinces the warmth of your bene|volence, and claims the ju&s;t gratitude of all this family.</P>
<P>Talk not of gratitude, I entreat, cried he. If through the intere&s;t of my family I have been &s;o fortunate as to render a &s;light &s;ervice to Mi&s;s Seymour, damp not the plea&s;ure it gives me by attaching to it an idea of obligation it &s;o little me|rits; or if (for you will find I am willing to make the very mo&s;t of the favour) if I can flatter my&s;elf with having enjoyed the happine&s;s either of obliging Mi&s;s Seymour, or on her account of having gratified <HI>your</HI> wi&s;hes, will you give me leave to point out to you how you may cancel the obligation at once and make me mo&s;t &s;incerely regard my&s;elf as <HI>your</HI> debtor.</P>
<P>If I have the <HI>power,</HI> Mr. Roat&s;ley, re|turned
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Mr. Howard &s;miling, be a&s;&s;ured the <HI>will</HI> is not wanting.</P>
<P>The power of granting my reque&s;t, I mu&s;t conclude you are in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, &s;ince it is by permi&s;&s;ion of Mi&s;s Sey|mour I venture to make it; and allow me to premi&s;e, that without the &s;anction of <HI>her</HI> approbation and con&s;ent I cer|tainly &s;hould not have had the pre&s;ump|tion (however anxious) to demand par|ticulars into which I have no title but from her indulgence and your's to pene|trate. Will you however favour me &s;o far as to inform me of &s;uch circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent and pa&s;t &s;ituation, as may enable me to judge in what manner I may perhaps one day have it in my power really and e&s;&s;entially to &s;erve.</P>
<P>If your pre&s;ent enquiry reaches only to pecuniary matters, Sir, returned Mr. Howard, I have the plea&s;ure of a&s;&s;uring you that in regard to that circum&s;tance, Mi&s;s Seymour's &s;ituation has never been
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;o extremely uncomfortable as I have rea|&s;on to believe was &s;ugge&s;ted to you. My wife's fortune, and her &s;i&s;ter's, amounted originally to twenty four thou&s;and pounds; but the &s;udden death of their guardian, who had the &s;ole management of this money, and who has left his affairs in the mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed and involved &s;itua|tion, in all human probability will reduce the &s;um to one tenth of its value. This certainly is a rever&s;e to be lamented; but the mind that is wholly untinctured with avarice, &s;eldom allows &s;uch morti|fications to inflict a pang either deep or of long continuance, and I am certain it has never proved the &s;ource of more than a tran&s;ient regret to either. Alas! human life is replete with di&s;tre&s;&s;es and anxieties which reach nearer to the heart, which pierce it in its tendere&s;t feelings, and wound it where it is mo&s;t open to the attack; and di&s;appointments of this na|ture, again&s;t which both my wife and &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="13" REF="14">
have had to &s;truggle at a very early pe|riod of life, have wholly blunted and obliterated the little rubs of adver&s;e for|tune.</P>
<P>I dare not venture to be inqui&s;itive, &s;aid Roat&s;ley, vi&s;ibly affected by the pic|ture drawn by Mr. Howard, yet will you call me &s;o when I acknowledge that both my curio&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion are &s;trongly excited. Remember however in my ju&s;tification, that Mi&s;s Seymour her|&s;elf permitted the enquiry, and if I mi&s;|take not &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed it was yet to be made.</P>
<P>You ought not to wonder at a circum|&s;tance &s;o natural, &s;aid Mr. Howard. Mi&s;s Seymour's a&s;toni&s;hment, great as it mu&s;t have been, can &s;carce exceed mine to find that her <HI>cou&s;in,</HI> the grand&s;on of Lord Belmont, remains &s;till uninformed of the natural ties that exi&s;t between them, e&s;pecially after the un&s;ucce&s;sful applica|tion made to his Lord&s;hip through the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
medium and interference of Lady Lin|ro&s;e for his countenance and favour.</P>
<P>At the expre&s;&s;ion "her cou&s;in, the grand&s;on of Lord Belmont," Roat&s;ley caught &s;uddenly the arm of Mr. Howard; and unable to interrupt him even by an ejaculation, remained rooted to the &s;pot on which he &s;tood in mute a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Good heavens! cried he, at length re|covering him&s;elf&mdash;is it indeed po&s;&s;ible that this amiable family, who &s;o forcibly engaged my intete&s;t and attachment al|mo&s;t in the in&s;tant that accident pre&s;ented them to my &s;ight, &s;hould really prove the children of my late unfortunate un|cle, and connected with me by the ties of blood as they have ever been by tho&s;e of regard and admiration. Permit me, my dear Sir, continued he, approaching Mr. Howard with open arms, to congra|tulate my&s;elf on this delightful informa|tion, and pray give me leave to flatter my&s;elf with the hopes of one day pro|curing
<PB N="15" REF="16">
an intere&s;t in the affections of my dear and valuable relations almo&s;t equal to what they have long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in mine.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard was not a little affected by this generous warmth, as apparent in his countenance and manner as in his language, and expre&s;&s;ed his feelings on the occa&s;ion in &s;trong terms.</P>
<P>But why has this explanation been made no &s;ooner? cried Roat&s;ley. Why have I continued &s;o long in a painful and lingering uncertainty in regard to a fa|mily &s;o re&s;pected and &s;o beloved? di&s;|tracted and confounded by the mo&s;t un|ju&s;t repre&s;entations, dark &s;ugge&s;tions, and at be&s;t vague and comfortle&s;s con|jectures.</P>
<P>Who may have found either intere&s;t or plea&s;ure in fabricating or in circula|ting injurious reports of your innocent and amiable cou&s;ins, &s;aid Mr. Howard, is not po&s;&s;ible for me to conceive, nei|ther will I lo&s;e a moment in attempting
<PB N="16" REF="17">
to confute what mu&s;t appear &s;o wholly unwarrantable and unju&s;t, that I &s;hall leave it entirely to time and intimacy to prove it &s;o in the fulle&s;t extent.</P>
<P>Unnece&s;&s;ary is the proof, cried Roat&s;|ley with warmth, for fal&s;e and malicious I have ever believed tho&s;e reports to be. Yet you, my dear Sir, I am per&s;uaded will be neither a&s;toni&s;hed nor offended, when I acknowledge that a multiplicity of di&s;agreeable rumours continually reaching my ears to the di&s;advantage of tho&s;e, of whom from the &s;urer evidence of my &s;en&s;es I had the mo&s;t amiable opi|nion, could not fail to &s;hock and torment me; and if you can &s;uppo&s;e a &s;tate in which you could ju&s;t &s;o far credit an a&s;|per&s;ion as to allow it to teize and perplex you, without permitting it to influence your judgment, paradoxical as that &s;tate may &s;eem it is exactly the &s;ituation under which my mind has for &s;ome time pa&s;t laboured.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">Far from being &s;urprized, returned Mr. Howard with his u&s;ual candour, I think I &s;hould only have been &s;o had you continued immovable and determined in your fir&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, when &s;uch infi|nite trouble and attention have been be|&s;towed to warp your judgment and mi&s;|lead your &s;entiments.</P>
<P>But my mother, you &s;ay, was in the &s;ecret. Pray how came <HI>&s;he</HI> to be in|formed, while I and the re&s;t of the family remained wholly ignorant and un&s;u&s;pici|ous that my fair cou&s;ins had ever dreamt of quitting the &s;ecluded &s;pot where they received their education.</P>
<P>That any individual of Lord Belmont's family &s;hould continue uninformed of any &s;tep taken by the ladies &s;ince their father's death, was by no means either their intention or mine. To their rela|tions no &s;ecrecy was requi&s;ite; and in regard to others, a temporary conceal|ment was merely thought nece&s;&s;ary, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="19">
it offered an ea&s;y method for e&s;cap|ing the impertinence of curio&s;ity and in|ve&s;tigation; and they naturally deferred relinqui&s;hing the name by which they had always hitherto been known, till the &s;anction and countenance of Lord Bel|mont &s;hould enable them to &s;upport the cruel retro&s;pections which they knew their father's memory mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain on their introduction into the world. An utter and ab&s;olute rejection from his Lord&s;hip to their application for acknow|ledgment, &s;oon pointed out the fortunate propriety and delicacy of this precaution, as they afterwards di&s;dained all thoughts of a&s;&s;uming or proclaiming their title to a name, of which their family, however unju&s;tly, deemed them unworthy.</P>
<P>You open a tran&s;action &s;o entirely new, wonderful, and inconceivable, cried Mr. Roat&s;ley, who had been attending with an expre&s;&s;ion of amazement in his coun|tenance to this &s;peech of Mr. Howard's,
<PB N="19" REF="20">
that I can no otherwi&s;e hope to reduce it to my comprehen&s;ion than by entreating you to favour me with a minute and re|gular detail of every circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard then beginning at the unhappy epocha of my dear father's mis|fortunes, related briefly yet with preci|&s;ion every particular re&s;pecting him and his children till the period of our arrival in England.</P>
<P>In regard to many of the&s;e events, &s;aid Mr. Howard while he repeated to us this intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, I could not &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Roat&s;ley compleatly igno|rant. It may be naturally inferred that tho&s;e who could traduce the innocent offspring would not fail to load the pa|rent's memory with additional reproach, and I doubt not but Mr. Roat&s;ley's mind has been early tinctured with the mo&s;t contumacious prejudices again&s;t his ill fated uncle. To know his errors, inde|pendent of the penitence and remor&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="21">
which &s;o powerfully extenuated and even obliterated his guilt, could not but mi&s;|lead the nephew's candour, and mu&s;t have induced him to regard with unabated horror a conduct that was followed by con&s;equences &s;o unhappy as to bani&s;h him for ever from his friends and coun|try.</P>
<P>I therefore dwelt with particular ener|gy on the di&s;mal lap&s;e of years &s;pent in &s;orrowful &s;eclu&s;ion that had &s;ucceeded to your father's rupture with his family, and continued invariably till his death: his contrition, his &s;ufferings, his rectitude and benevolence, and the a&s;&s;iduous care with which he ince&s;&s;antly laboured (and in which he &s;o well &s;ucceeded) to in&s;til into the minds of his children every vir|tuous and amiable &s;entiment, as a bar|rier again&s;t the temptations and vici&s;&s;i|tudes of a world that from a too fatal experience he believed &s;trewed with dan|gers and replete with mi&s;ery: and in or|der
<PB N="21" REF="22">
to enforce this relation, I promi&s;ed to procure him a peru&s;al of the manu|&s;cript written by your father's own hand, which, as he &s;eeks not in it either to pal|liate or conceal his faults, but breathes in every line that horror which ever at|tended the &s;en&s;e of his offences, offers a defence, the force of which candour mu&s;t admit and ju&s;tice it&s;elf acknowledge.</P>
<P>As Mr. Roat&s;ley did not attempt to interrupt Mr Howard, he proceeded to acquaint him with our arrival in town, our di&s;appointment in regard to Mr. Ben&s;eley's decea&s;e, our application in this uncomfortable and friendle&s;s &s;ituation to Lord Belmont through the medium of Lady Linro&s;e, and with every particular of the interview on that &s;ubject with her Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>He next recapitulated the &s;ub&s;tance of my letter to my grandfather, imploring his favour and protection; and in an&s;wer to this, &s;aid he, taking out of his pocket
<PB N="22" REF="23">
book the epi&s;tle written him on that oc|ca&s;ion, pray take the trouble of reading his Lord&s;hip's final determination from the pen of Lady Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>During the latter part of this relation, Mr. Roat&s;ley's countenance betrayed an agitation and a&s;toni&s;hment that gave de|fiance, Mr. Howard &s;aid, to all powers of expre&s;&s;ion. His perplexity, after read|ing the letter, &s;eemed but little abated. He was for &s;ome moments lo&s;t in thought; but at length breaking &s;ilence &mdash;all that I can po&s;&s;ibly conceive, cried he, all that it is in my power to conjecture or comprehend in this affair, is, that my mother having been her&s;elf deceived by the injurious a&s;per&s;ions fabricated by the infamous woman Brumpton, which have been circulated in town with a credit that a&s;toni&s;hes me, dreading the impetuo&s;ity of my temper, which might induce me to di&s;oblige Lord Belmont and even to act in open defiance of a prohibition &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="24">
unju&s;t, &s;o inhuman, &s;o wholly contrary to his natural character and benevolence, in con&s;equence of her apprehen&s;ion of creating that di&s;cordant di&s;&s;ention which ever leads to alienation of affection and of|ten to a total breach of family unanimity, has determined on concealing carefully from my knowledge every circum&s;tance of the application; yet I mu&s;t acknow|ledge my&s;elf extremely di&s;plea&s;ed at a &s;tep, which has been the means of re|taining me &s;o long in unea&s;ine&s;s and un|certainty, and the more I con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the whole tran&s;action, the more I am a&s;toni&s;hed and bewil|dered. To imagine that Lord Belmont, if properly apprized of the &s;ituation of his granddaughters, would allow an ob|&s;tinate and hardened prejudice to arre&s;t his ju&s;tice, to influence his humanity, and even to bani&s;h natural affection from his bo&s;om, is a &s;uppo&s;ition to which I cannot for an in&s;tant give credit; it is to
<PB N="24" REF="25">
believe him &s;carce human, and devoid of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t powerful principle of our moral con&s;truction. My mother in|deed labours under a cruel mi&s;repre&s;en|tation, to which &s;he has unfortunately given implicit faith, and which it has never been in my power to confute; for more than once have the Mi&s;s Seymours, though their names and &s;ome vague re|ports concerning them were all I con|cluded &s;he knew, been the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and even of altercation between us. Violently prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t them previous to their application, her accounts may have perhaps influenced Lord Bel|mont's determination, even without her intending or dreading the inju&s;tice which her repre&s;entation of their characters may have occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>This indeed in &s;ome mea&s;ure accounts for her Lady&s;hip's conduct, and even greatly exculpates her from the charge of &s;elfi&s;h and intere&s;ted views. While &s;he re|garded
<PB N="25" REF="26">
us in the light of relations who were likely to reflect di&s;honour upon our family, and who could bring no con&s;ola|tion to the de&s;olated bo&s;om of our grand|father, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that her mediation in our favour would prove fervent, nor that her anxiety for our &s;uc|ce&s;s could be as &s;incere as if our conduct had &s;upported our claims. Her cold re|ception of Mr. Howard, and her di&s;tant re&s;erve to my&s;elf, are here fully explained; and while the motives of her Lady&s;hip's conduct are cleared up, a di&s;tant hope opens to view, that her prejudices being removed, tho&s;e of our only &s;urviving pa|rent may yet li&s;ten to truth and yield to the voice of nature.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;urprizing, however, that the infamous de&s;igns of this wretch Brump|ton in a&s;per&s;ing our reputations, &s;hould have &s;o exten&s;ively &s;pread the &s;lander as to reach the ears of a per&s;on who moves in a &s;phere &s;o &s;uperior, &s;o di&s;tinct
<PB N="26" REF="27">
from that wicked woman's line of life, and that the&s;e calumnies &s;hould have flown with &s;uch rapidity; for Lady Lin|ro&s;e mu&s;t have learnt that we were un|worthy of her notice almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;he was informed that we &s;olicited it. Mr. Howard's letter indeed, &s;he received before her departure from her country &s;eat, had afforded her an opportunity of being made acquainted with any particu|lars; but during the &s;hort interval be|tween her arrival in town and her confer|ence with Mr. Howard, our bu&s;y ene|mies mu&s;t have contrived to &s;ow the &s;eeds of that contageous di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;gu&s;t, which then proceeded to infect and influ|ence Lord Belmont.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation having detained the two gentlemen till extremely late, they then &s;eparated and went to re&s;t; though not before Roat&s;ley had reminded Mr. Howard of his promi&s;e to intercede with my &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf to procure him a
<PB N="27" REF="28">
peru&s;al of the manu&s;cript to which in his narration he had &s;o often alluded.</P>
<P>So plea&s;ed, &s;o affected was I with this relation, that it was with difficulty I could re&s;train my too vi&s;ible emotion; and I willingly gave into Mr. Howard's hands the di&s;mal packet, the mere &s;ight of which as it lies in my bureau often &s;addens my gaye&s;t moments.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley has been up &s;ome time, &s;aid Mr. Howard; and anxious to pre|&s;ent him&s;elf to you as a near and tender relation, has waited the hour of your ri&s;ing with all the impatience of a dear and long ab&s;ent friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard and my &s;i&s;ter then went to join him in the breakfa&s;ting parlour; but afraid to di&s;cover an agitation too poignant for the occa&s;ion, intere&s;ting as it was, I cho&s;e to remain a few moments behind in hopes of acquiring &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant my &s;i&s;ter appeared, Roat&s;|ley
<PB N="28" REF="29">
with open arms and a countenance in the highe&s;t degree expre&s;&s;ive of kind|ne&s;s and delight, approached her. Mr. Howard, cried he, are not cou&s;ins ble&s;t with peculiar privileges, and folding her in his arms, he embraced her with the tenderne&s;s and familiarity of a brother.</P>
<P>So our cou&s;in does not de&s;ert us, cried Fanny, receiving his &s;alute with equal ea&s;e and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Good heavens, my dear Mrs. Howard, I hope you do not confe&s;s ever having for a moment harboured a &s;u&s;picion at once &s;o unnatural and injurious.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then I entered; and quitting my &s;i&s;ter's hand, he ha&s;tened to &s;eize mine, which he ki&s;&s;ed very fervently more than once, though with a degree of embar|ra&s;&s;ment, and even of di&s;tance, yes even of di&s;tance Sophia, which did not in the lea&s;t influence his addre&s;s to Mrs. How|ard.</P>
<P>A variety of &s;en&s;ations, a conflict of
<PB N="29" REF="30">
emotions, in defiance of all my &s;um|moned calmne&s;s and re&s;olution, wholly deprived me of utterance. Will you not acknowledge me, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, cried he. At the&s;e words, you will blu&s;h for my weakne&s;s Sophia&mdash;(I'm &s;ure I do mo&s;t painfully at this moment, even at the recollection of my folly)&mdash;I bur&s;t into tears, and ha&s;tily pulling away my hand, turned from him in &s;ilence and ran out of the parlour.</P>
<P>A moment's reflexion &s;hewed me what an unaccountable appearance my, beha|viour mu&s;t have had to all pre&s;ent. With|out allowing my&s;elf therefore an in&s;tant for he&s;itation lea&s;t my &s;pirit &s;hould eva|porate, I wiped my eyes and forced my|&s;elf to return.</P>
<P>I blu&s;h for my&s;elf, &s;aid I on re-enter|ing the parlour; and my cheeks &s;uffi|ciently proved how true was the confe&s;|&s;ion; but as I have never before enjoyed the happine&s;s of knowing but one male
<PB N="30" REF="31">
relation, it is no wonder that the acknow|ledged pre&s;ence of another &s;hould bring the fir&s;t &s;o forcibly to my memory as wholly to overcome my feelings.</P>
<P>In &s;heltering my weakne&s;s under this little artifice, I was hardly guilty of de|ceit; for though my tears did not at that in&s;tant owe their &s;ource to this cau&s;e, the very idea had during the night drawn &s;howers from my eyes; and I could not help believing, that if our beloved father locked down upon his children, he mu&s;t witne&s;s with plea&s;ure, even in his angelic &s;tate, this re-union with his family.</P>
<P>Mr. Roat&s;ley only replied by pre&s;&s;ing my hand tenderly in &s;ilence; and per|ceiving the &s;ubject as yet too affecting for my &s;pirits, he forbore dwelling on it, and &s;hifted the conver&s;ation to topics le&s;s intere&s;ting. My heart was indeed &s;o completely awakened to &s;oftne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility, that the keenne&s;s of my feel|ings gave even to my glad emotions the
<PB N="31" REF="32">
tincture of melancholy; and while the mo&s;t heartfelt &s;atisfaction lightened my countenance, a tear, which all my ef|forts could hardly di&s;pen&s;e, was ready to follow every &s;mile.</P>
<P>Of our breakfa&s;t conver&s;ation I can really give you no account. Indeed I believe it is conferring an unmerited compliment on what pa&s;&s;ed to dignify it with the name of conver&s;ation. A hun|dred different topics were occa&s;ionally touched upon; but not one pur&s;ued with any method or connexion. Fanny's mirth was giddy and unbounded; Roat&s;|ley him&s;elf appeared in uncommon &s;pi|rits; and though I perhaps was not the mo&s;t talkative of the company, I believe my &s;ilent &s;atisfaction was &s;o apparent that I was far from appearing the lea&s;t plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Soon after breakfa&s;t he took leave of us in the kinde&s;t manner. I am unfor|tunately engaged, cried he in an&s;wer to the pre&s;&s;ing invitations of my &s;i&s;ter and

Mr. Howard, otherwi&s;e undoubtedly I &s;hould not have been proof again&s;t the friendly and obliging reque&s;t of my new found relations, but while I remain in the county, which I think of doing for &s;ome time, I flatter my&s;elf you will allow me often to be your gue&s;t.</P>
<P>He then departed, followed by Mr. Howard; who having &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in the village, accompanied him on hor&s;e|back part of the way.</P>
<P>Fanny and I, left then to our&s;elves, talked over every circum&s;tance of the tran&s;actions of la&s;t night. We made a thou&s;and reflexions, you may believe, upon the &s;ingularity of our &s;ituation, and formed various conjectures upon the con|duct of Lady Linro&s;e and the unaccount|able &s;ilence and &s;ecrecy &s;he has ob&s;erved; which we could not avoid attributing in part to &s;elfi&s;h motives.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter dwelt with plea&s;ure on the tenderne&s;s of her cou&s;in's behaviour on their fir&s;t meeting. Had I never &s;een him
<PB N="33" REF="36">
till now, &s;aid &s;he, the warmth of feeling with which he acknowledged a connexion &s;o repugnant to the wi&s;hes of his family mu&s;t in&s;tantly have gained my heart. On approaching you, I ob&s;erved he was more di&s;tant; and I confe&s;s the differ|ence &s;truck me obviou&s;ly. His addre&s;s to me was that of a kind and long ab&s;ent relation, who expre&s;&s;ed in that character, with affection and familiarity, the plea|&s;ure he felt at the rencontre; to you his behaviour &s;eemed to betray more of the timidity of the lover than the undi&s;gui&s;ed kindne&s;s of the friend.</P>
<P>O certainly it re&s;embled the timidity of a lover extremely, cried I in an ironi|cal tone, and I am afraid rather pee|vi&s;hly, for Fanny bur&s;t into a loud laugh.</P>
<P>Nay, cried &s;he, I really think you have &s;ome rea&s;on to be jealous; for it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed I am grown a prodi|gious favourite &s;ince la&s;t night, and be|fore, you know, he u&s;ed to be &s;o en|tirely
<PB N="34" REF="37">
engaged in another quarter, that he never could give him&s;elf the trouble to &s;peak nor to li&s;ten to me, and &s;eldom &s;eemed even con&s;cious I was in the &s;ame room with him.</P>
<P>She was diverting her&s;elf at my ex|pence, when Mr. Howard returned. Pray Fanny, cried he, what is it that amu&s;es you?</P>
<P>Nay I dare not tell for my ears, re|turned &s;he, for Hermione will beat me; but &s;miling expre&s;&s;ively, &s;he &s;ung the&s;e two lines from the entertainment of Mi|das:
<Q><L>My &s;i&s;ter, he ki&s;s'd her, but me he pa&s;s'd by,</L>
<L>I'm jealous of the fellow's bad ta&s;te and blind eye.</L></Q>
She needed not have &s;topped there, for words could not have contrived to ex|plain more clearly what &s;he pretended to conceal, and Mr. Howard's countenance expre&s;&s;ed a momentary &s;mile, but as if he was de&s;irous of relieving my embar|ra&s;&s;ment,
<PB N="35" REF="38">
which was indeed extreme, he in&s;tantly entered on a new &s;ubject, tho' the rapidity with which he did &s;o, by confirming my apprehen&s;ions of &s;u&s;pi|cion, gave me very &s;evere mortification.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after began to join warmly with my &s;i&s;ter in prai&s;e of our cou&s;in's amiable qualities; and with an enthu&s;i|a&s;m which delighted me, though I hardly ventured to appear attentive, recapitu|lated the conver&s;ation he had had with him during their ride. Though we have &s;uffered &s;o unaccountably from the breath of fame, &s;aid he, it has at lea&s;t rendered us ju&s;tice to this young man, who&s;e cha|racter ri&s;es upon me every opportunity I enjoy of conver&s;ing with him. I have ju&s;t been receiving &s;ome farther lights in regard to the ignorance in which he has continued thus long, and which appeared &s;o extraordinary after the information given us in Mrs. Hindon's letter; but he has ju&s;t now told me that during the
<PB N="36" REF="39">
conver&s;ation he had with my &s;i&s;ter in law that evening at her hou&s;e, &s;he touched &s;o lightly on particulars, &s;uppo&s;ing him already perfectly informed of the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances, that not a hint e&s;caped her which could have led him to di&s;cover his connexion with you. All I learnt from her was, &s;aid he, that the two ladies had been unfortunate, were in|volved in con&s;equent difficulties, and that an application to Lord Belmont (I con|cluded for his intere&s;t towards obtaining a pen&s;ion) had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. My anxiety could not fail to be &s;trongly ex|cited: yet as the opportunity in a large company was unfavourable for entering more fully on the &s;ubject, I intended, for farther information, to apply next day to Mrs. Hindon, when I hoped to find her di&s;engaged and at liberty to &s;a|tisfy me; and in the mean while I deter|mined to enquire of my mother what &s;he knew of the affair, as I under&s;tood from
<PB N="37" REF="40">
&s;ome words dropped by Mrs. Hindon, that &s;he had intere&s;ted her&s;elf in the ap|plication. I &s;eized the earlie&s;t moment I could lay hold of to mention the mat|ter to her, and next morning at breakfa&s;t a&s;ked her if &s;he had ever been told that two young ladies of the name of Seymour, ladies who&s;e names &s;he had often heard me repeat with every expre&s;&s;ion of admi|ration, had be&s;ought my grandfather's intere&s;t towards procuring them an an|nuity from government. My mother's an&s;wer I perfectly recollect. She told me &s;he believed &s;uch a demand had been made by the ladies in que&s;tion, but that di&s;advantageous reports circulated a|gain&s;t them had arre&s;ted his Lord&s;hip's intended exertions in their behalf, nor could he think of applying publicly in favour of girls, who&s;e conduct by all ac|counts would reflect but di&s;credit upon tho&s;e who intere&s;ted them&s;elves in their affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41">It was in vain, continued Mr. Roat&s;|ley, that I combated the&s;e unju&s;t imputa|tions with all the arguments in my power, and appealed to your character (as their guardian) &s;o fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the eyes of all favoured with your acquaintance. My mother coolly an&s;wered, that men even of the &s;tricte&s;t probity were not likely to withdraw their protection on ac|count even of the mo&s;t flagrant impro|prieties of conduct in young girls com|mitted to their charge, and that it was more than probable they had even im|po&s;ed on you with a borrowed appear|ance of that merit which art could ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ume and beauty &s;ufficiently enforce. This, &s;he &s;aid upon &s;econd thoughts, &s;eemed indi&s;putably the ca&s;e, &s;ince a &s;ingle evening &s;pent accidentally in their company had rendered me &s;o warmly their friend, and had induced me &s;o ro|mantically to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e, though totally uninformed of their characters and
<PB N="39" REF="42">
connexions. They were unknown in this country, even by my own account; (for I had mentioned that circum&s;tance as a motive of compa&s;&s;ion) their &s;ame was dubious at be&s;t: and &s;uch mi&s;con|duct had been laid to their charge, that even this phra&s;e was a charitable one.</P>
<P>I warmly demanded from whom this &s;landerous intelligence had been received, and was at length unwillingly informed, that the woman with whom you lodged when in town had acknowledged to my mother's maid that the connexion be|tween the ladies and their guardian was much too intimate for the di&s;tance re|quired between a gentleman of character and his wards.</P>
<P>Shocked and confounded, though per|fectly &s;atisfied of the infamous fal&s;hood of this &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ion, I was deter|mined to have the matter fully explained, and in&s;tantly went to the woman's hou&s;e, where having entered into conver&s;ation
<PB N="40" REF="43">
with her I enquired particularly about her late gue&s;ts. Her an&s;wers were am|biguous and eva&s;ive: and I &s;oon per|ceived the character of the landlady was &s;uch as mu&s;t render all information from that quarter fal&s;e and injurious. I there|fore &s;oon quitted her, fir&s;t reprimanding her for the infamous a&s;per&s;ions &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed, and a&s;&s;uring her that the la|dies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed friends who would loudly confute and rigorou&s;ly puni&s;h tho&s;e who might utter them. I returned home furni&s;hed as I imagined with proofs and arguments more than &s;ufficient to over|throw the mo&s;t determined prejudices. But my mother would hardly allow me to enter on the &s;ubject; and telling me neither her&s;elf nor I had any intere&s;t in the behaviour of two girls who were unknown to her even by &s;ight, and &s;he was afraid fully as unknown to me by character, al|though the acquaintance of a few hours had enabled me to judge &s;o perfectly of
<PB N="41" REF="44">
their di&s;po&s;itions, po&s;itively declared &s;he &s;hould on no account be prevailed with to intercede with Lord Belmont in their behalf. I now perceive her motive, concluded Mr. Roat&s;ley, for retaining me in ignorance. Prejudiced her&s;elf again&s;t my cou&s;ins before &s;he was in|formed of their real name and &s;ituation, &s;he was unwilling to &s;trengthen a prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion which might lead me to act con|trary to the commands of Lord Belmont, who&s;e will in matters of the mo&s;t trifling moment has ever been regarded as a law in our family, and who it &s;eems has po&s;itively forbidden the protection or countenance of my mother to be ex|tended to the&s;e amiable relations. In|deed &s;he might well dread the impetu|o&s;ity of my temper on &s;uch an occa&s;ion would but ill brook the con&s;traint of a prohibition &s;o unnatural, and well might &s;he know that no Lord Belmont on earth would have prevailed with me
<PB N="42" REF="45">
to join in a mea&s;ure, which rea&s;on and humanity mu&s;t condemn, and the mo&s;t inflexible prejudice only could adopt.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not comment on this conver&s;a|tion, Sophia. It &s;peaks for it&s;elf. Adieu my love. My packet is immen&s;e, but I re&s;t a&s;&s;ured you do not complain of its length. I direct it to Avignon, as you de&s;ired, me in your la&s;t; from which place I expect &s;oon to receive a long volume of your journal.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY I walked out as u&s;ual in the morning, intending to &s;trole
<PB N="43" REF="46">
through the wood, attended by one of the par&s;on's little girls, of whom my &s;i&s;ter is extremely fond, and who often finds her way up the hill and &s;pends the day with us. She is a delightful child of five years old, with a countenance animated and blooming as the &s;pring; her flaxen hair curls round her face in ringlets &s;o picture&s;que, that I imagined &s;he would be an admirable &s;ubject for my pencil, and have accordingly drawn her in crayons, care&s;&s;ing a favourite lit|tle dog who always accompanies her in her vi&s;its. The portrait has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my hopes; for I have &s;ucceeded tolerably well, both in the re&s;emblance and atti|tude, and it makes a very ornamental piece of furniture for the drawing room. Since that period, the child had been continually teizing me to draw a little picture as a pre&s;ent for her doll; and as children, when they have got a whim in their heads, are uncea&s;ing in their impor|tunities,
<PB N="44" REF="47">
&s;he per&s;ecuted me during our walk to &s;et down to work on a &s;heet of paper which &s;he had brought in her hand from the hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;cene here is romantic beyond imagination. The river, that murmurs below at the foot of a gentle de&s;cent, is &s;haded by the mo&s;t venerable oaks, which &s;ometimes form a thicket wild and &s;eque&s;tered, and in other places ad|mit views of a mo&s;t fertile and beautiful country; which being embelli&s;hed with the plantations &s;urrounding the &s;plendid &s;eats of &s;everal gentlemen of the county at a di&s;tance, and ornamented with a nearer &s;ight of the &s;pire belonging to the pari&s;h church, exhibits a pro&s;pect of gaiety as well, as grandeur. A walk that is cut in the &s;lope of the bank, is my favourite re&s;ort, and &s;o well calcu|lated for &s;oothing into a languor not un|plea&s;ant, any oppre&s;&s;ion which re&s;ts upon the mind, that I found it peculiarly
<PB N="45" REF="48">
&s;uited to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my &s;pirits; and to rid my&s;elf of Charlotte's impor|tunities, I at length &s;at down on one of the green &s;eats, and pulling out a pen|cil began to trace a little rough &s;ketch which &s;oon &s;atisfied the child, who em|ployed her&s;elf in running about gather|ing no&s;egays from the wood flowers that adorned the banks of the river.</P>
<P>Having the pencil in my hand, I be|gan almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to delineate upon the cover of a letter, features &s;o deeply engraven on my mind, that I required not the pre&s;ence of the original to enable me to recollect every trait of expre&s;&s;ion with accuracy; and a few &s;trokes, though incorrect and unfini&s;hed, &s;oon exhibited a re&s;emblance, to which, innumerable as have been my &s;ecret at|tempts on the &s;ame &s;ubject, I had never before attained.</P>
<P>Charmed with my &s;ucce&s;s, I gazed with delight on the drawing which pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="46" REF="49">
to be the private companion of many a &s;olitary hour; and &s;o wholly ab&s;orbed was I in contemplating my per|formance, that I heard not the &s;ound of &s;teps that approached me, till a voice almo&s;t at my ear &s;aid&mdash;I hope I don't di&s;turb your meditations, Mi&s;s Seymour: and &s;uddenly looking up, I beheld Roat&s;ley immediately behind me.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious apprehen&s;ion made me in|&s;tantly &s;tart up in confu&s;ion; and the paper dropping from my hand, a light breeze which ju&s;t then &s;eemed to ri&s;e for the purpo&s;e of plunging me into difficulties, got hold of it, and quickly conveyed it down the &s;lope of the bank below.</P>
<P>Uncertain whether he had a glimp&s;e of it or not, and unable to recover my|&s;elf &s;ufficiently to affect unconcern, I ut|tered not a word, but followed the fly|ing cover with my eyes, in which anxiety and embarra&s;&s;ment were &s;o &s;trongly
<PB N="47" REF="50">
painted, that Roat&s;ley in&s;tantly added&mdash; what a world of mi&s;chief have I been guilty of, and directly flew to recover it.</P>
<P>For heaven's &s;ake, exclaimed I in ab&s;olute agonies, for heaven's &s;ake don't think about it. It is not of the &s;lighte&s;t importance; it is a trifle, a drawing, not worth the trouble of picking up; and catching hold of his arm, (for I knew not what I was doing) ju&s;t as he had arrived at the &s;pot where a bu&s;h ob|&s;tructed its progre&s;s&mdash;For God's &s;ake come away, repeated I with a vehemence the mo&s;t ill judged and ab&s;urd, and &s;o far beyond what the occa&s;ion could po&s;|&s;ibly require without the intere&s;t of &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e, that no wonder he &s;tood with his eyes fixed upon me in mute a&s;toni&s;hment. The look of perplexity and &s;urpri&s;e with which he regarded me in&s;tantly di&s;covered to me my fooli&s;h imprudence in giving way to an alarm that had in fact no real foundation, and
<PB N="48" REF="51">
from which a &s;mall degree of &s;elf com|mand and pre&s;ence of mind might have relieved me. I then heartily repented my folly; but alas! it was too late, and I only di&s;covered my unfortunate ab|&s;urdity time enough to lament its effects.</P>
<P>We were both &s;ilent for a few mo|ments. At length &mdash;I cannot think any thing a trifle, &s;aid he, with a flu&s;h on his countenance, that gives Mi&s;s Seymour &s;uch vi&s;ible unea&s;ine&s;s; e&s;pecially&mdash;a drawing too&mdash;added he he&s;itating. The &s;ubject of her &s;olitary contemplation. Allow me at lea&s;t, Madam, to re&s;tore to you what appears of &s;uch infinite value; and darting forward, he caught the pa|per in his hand.</P>
<P>Sir, cried I, with a &s;pirit which the pre&s;ent exigency alone could have in|&s;pired, and with all the firmne&s;s my ter|ror gave me courage to a&s;&s;ume, only hear me: if you ca&s;t one look on that paper,
<PB N="49" REF="52">
never will I pardon, never will I &s;ee you more.</P>
<P>This &s;peech certainly was frantic in the highe&s;t degree. It was acknowledg|ing the truth of his hint; it was allow|ing him to conclude that the drawing was the re&s;emblance of &s;ome per&s;on dear to my heart, &s;ince my agitation appeared &s;o uncontroulable; but my imprudent unea&s;ine&s;s from the beginning mu&s;t I imagined have infu&s;ed the&s;e &s;u&s;picions by this time &s;trongly into his mind; and &s;hocked to the &s;oul at the apprehen&s;ion of my heart being thus laid open in a manner &s;o mortifying, &s;o dreadful, to the man on earth from whom I mo&s;t wi&s;hed its weakne&s;s concealed, this &s;ud|den prohibition &s;truck me as the only po&s;&s;ible means of preventing immediate detection.</P>
<P>He &s;till held the paper in his hand, and would not be prevailed with to re|&s;tore it; but he made no attempt to exa|mine
<PB N="50" REF="53">
it. I dare not ri&s;k your di&s;plea|&s;ure, cried he, with a countenance ex|pre&s;&s;ive of unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;u&s;pen&s;e. To be bani&s;hed from your &s;ight, and the object of your hate, are ideas too horrible, too in&s;upportable to be thought of; yet are they almo&s;t the only puni&s;hments that could at this in&s;tant &s;o forcibly operate on my mind as to arre&s;t my impatience and deter me from &s;atisfying my burn|ing curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Give me the paper, cried I; it be|longs to me&mdash;it is mine&mdash;</P>
<P>And is dear to you, interrupted he with a voice almo&s;t &s;uffocated, and hold|ing it above my reach: &s;ay that it is dear to you, and I will indeed fly your &s;ight for ever.</P>
<P>No, cried I, 'tis nobody&mdash;'tis nothing &mdash;it is not of the lea&s;t: con&s;equence&mdash; only give it me, or I never will forgive you.</P>
<P>Little Charlotte perceiving this al|tercation,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
ju&s;t then came running up to us. Is it the pretty gentleman's picture, cried &s;he, for I had been imprudent enough to allow her to look over me while I was roughly &s;ketching it.</P>
<P>A gentleman's picture, repeated Roat&s;|ley. Yes that it mu&s;t be, and the re&s;em|blance of the mo&s;t ble&s;t, the mo&s;t envied of mankind.</P>
<P>No, cried I, with an imprudence which I &s;hall deplore to my late&s;t hour but of which my exhau&s;ted &s;pirits made me uncon&s;ciou&s;ly guilty, I almo&s;t hate him at this in&s;tant, and (oh! Sophia, you will blu&s;h the deepe&s;t crim&s;on for me) I bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>The&s;e words, and the manner, the warmth with which they were pro|nounced, alas! too plainly di&s;covered the fatal &s;ecret. Scarce had they e&s;caped my lips, when their too obvious mean|ing was apparent to my&s;elf. My feel|ings were then unutterable, but con|&s;cious
<PB N="52" REF="55">
that my folly could not be recalled, I &s;aw no con&s;olation but in flight, and turning away with all the expedition in my power, I was flying down the bank towards the Chine&s;e bridge, when Roat&s;|ley, too violently agitated to perceive the pre&s;ence of the child, &s;uddenly &s;eiz|ing my hand, prevented me by throw|ing him&s;elf at my feet. Mi&s;s Seymour, cried he, with an energy which mu&s;t have &s;urmounted all oppo&s;ition had re|&s;i&s;tance been in my power&mdash;lovely and adored Mi&s;s Seymour, &s;tay but for an in&s;tant. That &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion which has proved the torment of my life &s;o long, how &s;hall I &s;tifle or conceal in a moment like this? how &s;hall I &s;uppre&s;s the per|haps too fatal pre&s;umption to which it gives birth! For the &s;ake of heaven, al|low me either to put an interpretation on your pre&s;ent agitation, which will overwhelm me with a tran&s;port almo&s;t too infinite to be &s;upported, or at once,
<PB N="53" REF="56">
by withdrawing your prohibition, da&s;h my delu&s;ive hopes and puni&s;h my a&s;pir|ing folly as it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia, what were my &s;en&s;ations at this &s;peech. I tried in vain to di&s;en|gage my hand; and having at length effected it, I covered my face with both, and almo&s;t &s;unk upon the ground. Roat&s;|ley, alarmed at my &s;ituation, ha&s;tily aro&s;e, and obliging me to lean on his arm, &s;upported me almo&s;t fainting to a bench that encircled the trunk of an ancient &s;ycamore not far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Weakne&s;s for a few moments &s;u&s;|pended &s;hame, but &s;oon my &s;trength re|turning, my confu&s;ion redoubled with a violence un&s;peakable. During this &s;hort interval we were both &s;ilent, and Roat&s;|ley alternately ki&s;&s;ed the hand he held in his and the drawing which he had now ventured to examine, and which he re|garded as the a&s;&s;ured pledge of my af|fection. Oh! my Sophia, feel for your
<PB N="54" REF="57">
friend at this moment of emotion. Con|ceive if you can my &s;en&s;ations. But in|deed that is wholly impo&s;&s;ible. I was overwhelmed with &s;hame, covered with blu&s;hes, and my pride mo&s;t painfully wounded: the &s;everity of the mortifica|tion I endured made me wi&s;h that I could &s;ink into the ground and for ever conceal my&s;elf from the eyes of Roat&s;ley, who gazed on me with a delight cha&s;|tened by a degree of diffidence that &s;eemed to aim at reconciling me to my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Pardon me, lovelie&s;t of women, cried he the moment he &s;aw me beginning to recover, which I no &s;ooner did than I attempted to ri&s;e&mdash;pardon the man who adores you&mdash;who would &s;acrifice his life, his happine&s;s, for your's.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he pronounced the&s;e words with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate warmth, little Charlotte, who had been pre&s;ent during the whole of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene, a cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="55" REF="58">
which our mutual agitation had prevented our di&s;covering, came running forward, and &s;urpri&s;ing him upon his knees, &s;tared at the &s;ingularity of his attitude with a look of curio&s;ity and &s;urpri&s;e that quickly re&s;tored both his recollection and mine.</P>
<P>Roat&s;ley &s;tarted from the po&s;ture from which I had before repeatedly entreated him to ri&s;e without effect, and in&s;tantly getting up to leave him, I declared that on no account I could remain longer; and unable to meet his eyes, quickened my &s;teps towards the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Stay but for a few moments, &s;aid he in a low voice, but in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner; leave me not in this agonizing &s;u&s;pen&s;e I be&s;eech you.</P>
<P>My confu&s;ion and perplexity having &s;omewhat &s;ub&s;ided, my heart began to ta&s;te the felicity of knowing (di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as had been the circum&s;tances to which I owed the di&s;covery) that what I felt I had
<PB N="56" REF="59">
not been incapable of in&s;piring; but at this moment the recollection of Lady Elizabeth and his engagements ru&s;hing upon my mind, &s;hame, re&s;entment, and angui&s;h, all at once a&s;&s;ailed me; and recalling with bitter regret the weak|ne&s;s I had betrayed and the profe&s;&s;ions which compa&s;&s;ion perhaps alone had extorted, I pulled away the hand that Roat&s;ley had again &s;eized, and ha&s;tily &s;aid&mdash;you have egregiou&s;ly deceived your&s;elf Sir, and I own I am ju&s;tly to blame in having partly given cau&s;e for the deception; but I de&s;ire you will leave me, and allow me to return in|&s;tantly home. I &s;hall be &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;|plea&s;ed if you per&s;i&s;t in detaining me; and having &s;lightly curt&s;eyed to him, though without venturing to regard him, I redoubled my pace and arrived at the hou&s;e, not having once looked back.</P>
<P>On entering the hall, my &s;i&s;ter ran to me. Hermione, cried &s;he, what have
<PB N="57" REF="60">
you done with your&s;elf all the morning. I have been &s;ending to the hut and all over the wood to find you: for pray who do you think is about to honour us with a vi&s;it, but our conde&s;cending Right Honourable relation, Lady Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e! repeated I in amaze|ment.</P>
<P>Yes, her &s;ervant has been here with a card informing us that her Lady&s;hip is on the road to wait on us, and entreats the favour of being allowed to &s;ee us one half hour in private.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he &s;poke a carriage and four drove up to the door; and &s;carce had we gained the parlour, when Lady Linro&s;e her&s;elf entered it.</P>
<P>She approached us with a look of the mo&s;t engaging and affectionate familiar|ity. I may well dread the reception I ought to meet with, &s;aid &s;he, taking a hand of each; but if the countenance is to be tru&s;ted, I will venture to hope
<PB N="58" REF="61">
that a behaviour which I have been un|willingly con&s;trained hitherto to &s;upport will not, when its motives are candidly examined, utterly exclude me from the pro&s;pect of obtaining your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Confounded by an addre&s;s &s;o unex|pected, we bowed in &s;ilence; and my &s;i&s;ter leading to the &s;opha we all &s;eated our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I am now venturing on a &s;tep, re|&s;umed her Lady&s;hip, which I have long ardently wi&s;hed it in my power to pur|&s;ue, but which even at this moment is &s;o dangerous and daring, that the exi|gency of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and a due regard to my own character only, can excu&s;e or palliate my imprudence. I have long mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired the op|portunity of a moment like this, in which I could fairly and candidly lay before you the motives of a conduct which mu&s;t doubtle&s;s have appeared to you har&s;h, cruel, and unfeeling. Alas! you knew
<PB N="59" REF="62">
not, that while duty withheld from you the protection to which you &s;o ju&s;tly laid claim, &s;lander and inju&s;tice united to render the prohibition on my part ea&s;y to fulfil. Lately, but very lately, was I made acquainted with the value of what, by the commands of a parent, I am deprived of enjoying&mdash;your friend|&s;hip and &s;ociety. No &s;ooner however was the veil taken from my eyes, than my mind became unea&s;y till it had ac|knowledged its injurious prejudices; and &s;ome alarming circum&s;tances, to which I mu&s;t entreat one quarter of an hour's attention, have at length deter|mined me to hazard the danger of Lord Belmont's di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;hould this act of di&s;obedience reach his ears, rather than continue to appear in a light &s;o injurious to my heart, &s;o contrary to my real feel|ings.</P>
<P>Having received a bow of acknow|ledgment from my &s;i&s;ter, and an a&s;&s;urance
<PB N="60" REF="63">
from me that the pre&s;ent apology en|tirely obliterated all recollection of what once perhaps we might have con&s;idered as unkind, her Lady&s;hip proceeded.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place &s;incerely ac|knowledge, continued &s;he, that I have no adequate apology to offer for having given credit to a&s;per&s;ions which I have &s;ince found &s;o perfectly ill founded and unju&s;t; but perhaps you may be kind enough to admit &s;ome &s;ort of palliation from the utter ignorance in which I had been retained re&s;pecting you. That I had &s;uch relations, was merely all I knew; and no &s;ooner had I received Mr. Howard's letter, than I determined in my own mind to afford you all the civility, kindne&s;s, and attention, to which your youth, &s;ex, and &s;ituation in a quar|ter of the world entirely new, ju&s;tly en|titled you, e&s;pecially as it was not diffi|cult for me to perceive you were the &s;ame agreeable party which my &s;on had
<PB N="61" REF="64">
encountered on his journey, with whom he had been &s;o much charmed and in who&s;e favour he had &s;o much prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed me. Had he been with me at the moment of my receiving the letter, I &s;hould undoubtedly have in&s;tantly yielded to the warmth of my compa&s;&s;ion, and entru&s;ted him, however imprudently, with the &s;ecret of your birth and con|nexion; but indi&s;pen&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s had hurried him from me almo&s;t immediately upon his arrival, and time being given me for con&s;ideration, I fore&s;aw how pre|carious and perplexing was the part I had now to act. Lord Belmont's character was well known to me. Though rigid in principle and fervent in benevolence, his prejudices are rooted and immovable; and a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion once fixed in his mind, allows neither rea&s;on nor humanity to interfere towards its extirpation. What &s;teps he might pur&s;ue were doubt|ful and my fears greatly overbalanced
<PB N="62" REF="65">
my hopes as to the genero&s;ity of his con|duct. The&s;e reflections, though com|bated by my &s;ecret wi&s;hes, determined me to &s;tand aloof till his Lord&s;hip's re|&s;olution was known; and if po&s;&s;ible, by guarding the &s;ecret carefully from my family and more e&s;pecially from my &s;on, who&s;e warmth of feelings and impetuo&s;ity I particularly dreaded, to pre&s;erve them from the wrathful effects of a di&s;plea|&s;ure from which I my&s;elf have &s;uffered too &s;everely not to apprehend it with terror.</P>
<P>I intended to ha&s;ten to town; but &s;ome previous bu&s;ine&s;s of real moment deferred my journey for &s;ome little time, and an alarming complaint, but of &s;hort duration, confined me &s;o clo&s;ely for a few days after my arrival, that I had no opportunity for tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s that had occa&s;ioned my removal, and which from the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving it a profound &s;ecret I was unable to ma|nage
<PB N="63" REF="66">
by an agent. During this interval, anxious to get information through every po&s;&s;ible means of the &s;ituation of my young relations, in regard to whom I felt my&s;elf extremely &s;olicitous, it may be ea&s;ily conjectured that I attempted every channel of intelligence, and made enquiry of every per&s;on whom friend&s;hip or intimacy allowed to vi&s;it me during my confinement. I was con&s;trained to mention you however merely as agreea|ble, accidental acquaintances, whom my &s;on had repre&s;ented to me in an engaging and favourable point of view, and your very names were unknown to all to whom I applied, my &s;on's friend Mr. Brad&s;haw excepted; who informed me that he had the honour of re&s;iding under the &s;ame roof with you, but who&s;e light and di&s;|re&s;pectful manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf &s;hocked and confounded me. The par|ticulars which I contrived to draw from him, though vague and void of proof,
<PB N="64" REF="67">
I mu&s;t acknowledge infu&s;ed a portion of doubt and di&s;tru&s;t into my mind; but when I take the liberty of repeating what he &s;aid, I hope you will in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;e and forgive me.</P>
<P>Your per&s;onal charms alone, he told me, were known to him; for to your private characters he was a &s;tranger, tho' if appearances were to be tru&s;ted, the latter by no means conferred any addi|tional lu&s;tre on the former: he &s;ome time afterwards added, that he had been in|formed at all hands you were light, doubtful, and indi&s;creet; your princi|pal, if not your almo&s;t only a&s;&s;ociate, being a woman of infamous character, at who&s;e windows he him&s;elf had frequently beheld you. Though I was thunder-&s;truck at this intelligence, I did not give it implicit credit, but contrived to di&s;patch my own maid, who has been long and de&s;ervedly in my confidence, with orders to make private enquiries
<PB N="65" REF="68">
re&s;pecting your conduct of the people with whom you lodged. Their accounts, ambiguous and perplexing, &s;erved only to &s;trengthen and confirm my error.</P>
<P>Here I could not re&s;i&s;t making an attempt to interrupt Lady Linro&s;e, with the de&s;ign of explaining the various and &s;ingular cau&s;es of the&s;e &s;hocking imputa|tions: but perceiving my intention&mdash; hold, my dear Madam, &s;aid &s;he warmly. Do me not the inju&s;tice to imagine I now require any particulars to convince me of your innocence, and of my own in|con&s;iderate conclu&s;ions. 'Tis <HI>my</HI> vindi|cation not your's that brought me hither; and if any doubt could have remained on my mind, after having been once in your company, my &s;on's explanation mu&s;t have wholly removed it. I have already engaged your attention too long: yet I mu&s;t reque&s;t the indulgence of a few moments longer.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of affairs, when
<PB N="66" REF="69">
I be&s;ought the favour of a vi&s;it from Mr. Howard; and in &s;pite of the ill opi|nion I had imbibed of his wards, I wrote to Lord Belmont in their behalf with all the warmth they could have de&s;ired; though to own the truth, the longer I reflected the more was I convinced that the &s;ucce&s;s of the application would be &s;uch as it proved. The event ju&s;tified my prudence in having concealed the matter from my &s;on; his Lord&s;hip, among&s;t other injunctions, having &s;trong|ly enjoined a continuation of &s;ecre&s;y. There is a certain portion of &s;pirit in my grand&s;on's character, &s;aid he in his letter, which leads me to dread his con|duct on this occa&s;ion. While I admire and approve of a di&s;po&s;ition that is the &s;ource in general of noble and generous actions, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I fear the effects of its enthu&s;ia&s;m, which may in|duce him to regard tho&s;e unfortunate re|lations as objects of peculiar intere&s;t and
<PB N="67" REF="70">
regard. I &s;olemnly declare however that his interference in this point with my commands, &s;hall for ever exclude him my favour and ca&s;t him from my heart for ever.</P>
<P>Some time afterwards, my &s;on one day unexpectedly demanded if I had ever been made acquainted with an applica|tion to Lord Belmont from tho&s;e ladies of the name of Seymour again&s;t whom I &s;eemed to have taken a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o unaccountable? I evaded the que&s;tion; and, though not without difficulty, &s;oon after waved the &s;ubject: for while his expre&s;&s;ions &s;hewed me that he knew but half the &s;ecret, his warmth convinced me his knowledge of the whole would prove de&s;tructive of that unanimity and affection which has ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and his grandfather.</P>
<P>Such being my private &s;entiments of you, and &s;uch my &s;ituation with my &s;on, you may ea&s;ily conceive what my a&s;to|ni&s;hment
<PB N="68" REF="71">
mu&s;t have been on finding my|&s;elf unexpectedly introduced to you at Holtenham Abbey. Your countenance, your manner, and the ingenuous inno|cence which &s;hone con&s;picuous in both, opened my eyes, and unavoidably en|gaged my regard and admiration. Yet withheld from acknowledging my&s;elf to you in the manner I wi&s;hed, I was unwil|lingly con&s;trained to a&s;&s;ume the di&s;tance of a &s;tranger; and I will candidly own, that as &s;uch I mu&s;t have &s;till continued, had not the pre&s;ent unhappy di&s;&s;ention between my favourite &s;on and my&s;elf obliged me to lay before you the private motives of my conduct&mdash;motives which I own only can excu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip was vi&s;ibly affected at the&s;e words; but having wiped her eyes, continued&mdash;Mr. Roat&s;ley, I find, has been informed, I &s;uppo&s;e by this family, of the whole affair; and di&s;plea&s;ed with the part which prudence per&s;uaded me
<PB N="69" REF="72">
to perform, la&s;t night de&s;ired from me an explanation of every particular. Finding all further &s;ecre&s;y impracticable, I readily and candidly acknowledged the truth; but this, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying and convincing him, &s;erved merely to heighten a re&s;entment that barely pre&s;erved the re&s;pect which duty and affection has ne|ver yet allowed him to forget towards his mother. Shocked to the &s;oul by this difference, the fir&s;t that from the moment of his birth ever occurred be|tween us, I determined to open my heart to <HI>you</HI>; from the flattering hope, that knowing the &s;ecret &s;pring of every part of my conduct, <HI>you</HI> might be ena|bled to do ju&s;tice to my motives; and I tru&s;t &s;hould the &s;ubject ever again recur when my &s;on vi&s;its you, you will have the goodne&s;s and genero&s;ity to convince him that in &s;uch circum&s;tances, where the inflexible di&s;plea&s;ure of Lord Belmont
<PB N="70" REF="73">
was at &s;take, it was the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of a parent to act as I did.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter and I in warm terms re|turned her Lady&s;hip thanks for this can|did and ingenuous explanation, which we &s;incerely a&s;&s;ured her entirely &s;atisfied us as to every point of her behaviour. As matters &s;tood, Sophia, it was un|doubtedly both prudent and natural for Lady Linro&s;e to conduct her&s;elf in the manner &s;he has done, and I now reflect with pain on the injurious opinion that chagrin and di&s;appointment induced us to entertain of a character which this one conver&s;ation developes in the mo&s;t amiable and honourable point of view.</P>
<P>We expre&s;&s;ed much unea&s;ine&s;s at the difference which Mr. Roat&s;ley's compa&s;|&s;ionate humanity, in e&s;pou&s;ing &s;o warmly our cau&s;e, had occa&s;ioned with a parent to who&s;e fore&s;ight and maternal atten|tions he owed &s;o much, and hoped it had proceeded no di&s;agreeable lengths.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="74">My &s;on, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;ition in the world. The conver&s;ation I have ju&s;t now mentioned, pa&s;&s;ed between us la&s;t night, when he a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to attend me in my dre&s;&s;ing room after &s;up|per. I had ob&s;erved that he was grave and unea&s;y the whole day; but no op|portunity for an explanation had till then occurred. Though gentle to exce&s;s, his pa&s;&s;ions, when once rou&s;ed, are by no means ea&s;ily controuled. The circum|&s;tances of your &s;ituation had naturally excited his compa&s;&s;ion, and his know|ledge of your amiable characters de|prived me of the only excu&s;e he would admit as a palliation of my conduct. Lord Belmont's prohibition, he &s;aid, he could regard as none where honour and humanity were concerned. There was neither &s;pirit nor principle in a &s;lavi&s;h dependence on the will and opinions of others. In &s;uch a moment, prudence
<PB N="72" REF="75">
was &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and obedience &s;o implicit could only be deemed abject and &s;ervile.</P>
<P>He left me with the&s;e words; but &s;oon after recollecting him&s;elf, he re|turned, not however with the intention of openly <HI>apologizing</HI> for his hear, but apparently from the wi&s;h of in &s;ome mea&s;ure <HI>atoning</HI> for it by talking over the matter with calmne&s;s and temper.</P>
<P>This he did; and we parted at a late hour on good terms. What had pa&s;&s;ed however hung heavy on my &s;pirits. I fore&s;aw a world of tumult and oppo&s;ition from this unfortunate di&s;covery, and I determined to ea&s;e my mind of part of its burthen by openly di&s;clo&s;ing my di&s;|quiets to the innocent cau&s;e of them, and entreating their forgivene&s;s for the men|tal injury I have done them.</P>
<P>My &s;on avows his re&s;olution of apply|ing to Lord Belmont in your favour, a determination, which far from di&s;&s;uading him from performing I highly approve
<PB N="73" REF="76">
of and &s;hall my&s;elf enforce with that ad|ditional energy which admiration and regard mu&s;t now produce; I cannot however avoid expre&s;&s;ing my apprehen|&s;ions that Roat&s;ley's interference will irri|tate rather than per&s;uade; and while to you he performs no e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, he is di&s;appointing and di&s;obliging his grand|father at the mo&s;t critical moment per|haps of his life: for I will not conceal any thing from you: I make no doubt indeed you mu&s;t already have been in|formed of it: my &s;on is &s;oon to be hap|pily &s;ettled in life with a mo&s;t amiable and valuable young lady; <HI>a tender af|fection &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them</HI>; the match is in every re&s;pect de&s;irable; but Lord Belmont's decided approbation can alone &s;ecure that of his young bride's family and connexions.</P>
<P>My heart, Sophia&mdash;oh! what did not my heart endure at the&s;e words? It died within me. I ca&s;t my eyes on the ground,
<PB N="74" REF="77">
and avoided with the utmo&s;t care the pe|netrating look with which Lady Linro&s;e regarded me. The agitating &s;cene that had &s;o recently pa&s;&s;ed between her &s;on and my&s;elf fla&s;hed with redoubled an|gui&s;h on my thoughts; the recollection was mi&s;ery, and I felt as a culprit in his mother's pre&s;ence. From this &s;tate of embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;tre&s;s, I was pre|&s;ently in part relieved by the entrance of my little teizing companion Charlotte, who had been playing on the green be|fore the hou&s;e, and ju&s;t at this moment appeared. Her Lady&s;hip, not thinking it prudent to proceed in a &s;ubject of &s;uch moment before the child, having now explained her&s;elf &s;ufficiently, &s;hifted the conver&s;ation to le&s;s intere&s;ting topicks; and being charmed with the little girl's beauty, began to chat with her.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other que&s;tions &s;uited to her age, Lady Linro&s;e, to &s;et her a prattling, made the enquiry with which all chil|dren
<PB N="75" REF="78">
have been &s;o often importuned, viz. which did &s;he love be&s;t, Mrs. Howard or Mi&s;s Seymour? and Charlotte, not in the lea&s;t at a lo&s;s for a reply which delicacy even in infancy &s;ometimes renders em|barra&s;&s;ing, in&s;tantly replied&mdash;oh Mi&s;s Seymour certainly. Every body loves Mi&s;s Seymour, and the gentleman loves her too, for I know that well enough.</P>
<P>We &s;hall get at all your &s;ecrets, Mi&s;s Seymour, cried Lady Linro&s;e, &s;miling at my un&s;peakable confu&s;ion. But pray, my dear, turning to the child, who is this admirer of Mi&s;s Seymour's?</P>
<P>What does the child mean, cried I, with a look which I intended for &s;urpri&s;e but which I am afraid partook infinitely more of alarm: pray don't be fooli&s;h Charlotte. But alas! I tried in vain to interrupt her; for delighted with being allowed to prate, and charmed with the importance of evidently di&s;tre&s;&s;ing me, &s;he an&s;wered Lady Linro&s;e archly in a
<PB N="76" REF="79">
loud whi&s;per&mdash;oh it mu&s;t be her lover you know; for he ki&s;&s;ed her hand ju&s;t now again and again in the Filbert walk.</P>
<P>Conceive, if it is po&s;&s;ible, my con&s;cious di&s;tre&s;s. Words can but faintly expre&s;s my &s;ituation. I dreaded that every fea|ture of my face would di&s;cover who this &s;ecret admirer was, and all &s;pirit to rally it off for&s;ook me. I thought at that moment this was certainly the mo&s;t pain|ful exce&s;s to which &s;hame and apprehen|&s;ion could arrive; but I was too &s;oon taught how deplorably erroneous was this idea.</P>
<P>A &s;hort and mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pau&s;e &s;uc|ceeded to Charlotte's &s;ally of gaiety. Lady Linro&s;e, perceiving I &s;uppo&s;e my unea&s;ine&s;s, politely forbore encrea&s;ing it by proceeding in her enquiries, and look|ing at her watch, ro&s;e to depart.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter a&s;ked the favour of her La|dy&s;hip's company to partake of a family dinner, if &s;he was not otherwi&s;e engaged.
<PB N="77" REF="80">
I &s;incerely regret, &s;aid &s;he, that I pro|mi&s;ed my friend Lady Mary to be home by four o'clock: for as my vi&s;its, my dear Mrs. Howard, mu&s;t be few and pri|vately &s;tolen, I lament that I cannot in|dulge my&s;elf with a longer one at pre|&s;ent: but we know not how things may turn out, added &s;he with great kindne&s;s &mdash;we may perhaps be more fortunate than we at pre&s;ent imagine.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard will regret not having &s;hared in the honour of this vi&s;it, Ma|dam, &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter: and ju&s;t as &s;he &s;poke, her hu&s;band, who had been told who was with us, entered the parlour.</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e received him with par|ticular civility; and though on her way to the carriage, which had been ordered to the door, unfortunately turned back and &s;at down again for a few minutes.</P>
<P>After the u&s;ual compliments and en|quiries&mdash;I flattered my&s;elf Mr. Roat&s;ley had accompanied your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid
<PB N="78" REF="81">
Mr. Howard, as I &s;aw him at a di&s;tance little more than an hour ago with my &s;i&s;|ter in the walk; but it was not then in my power to join them, as I was em|ployed procuring a&s;&s;i&s;tance to my old gardener, who has met with a very di&s;|agreeable accident this morning.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have mi&s;taken &s;ome other per&s;on for Mr. Roat&s;ley, &s;aid Mrs. How|ard, for he has not favoured us with his company to-day.</P>
<P>Was he not here, &s;i&s;ter, cried Mr. Howard turning to me with a &s;urpri&s;e which I fear my too apparent di&s;tre&s;s &s;ufficiently abated; for as if con&s;cious of having committed &s;ome mi&s;take, he left the &s;entence unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>This was too dreadful. I believe Mr. Roat&s;ley was walking to-day, &s;aid I at length: but the angui&s;h of my feelings made my voice faulter even during this &s;hort &s;entence; and Lady Linro&s;e ro&s;e, before I had concluded it, curt&s;eyed in
<PB N="79" REF="82">
&s;ilence to me, and taking her leave, was attended to the hall by Mr. Howard and my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Being left alone&mdash;oh God! cried I to my&s;elf, what a day of mi&s;ery has this been? My imprudence can only be equalled by my &s;hame and de&s;pair. I was in agonies. I now perceived that Roat&s;ley was inevitably devoted to ano|ther. The declaration, my Sophia, which bur&s;t from his lips, his rea&s;on, his principles, even his heart, mu&s;t condemn in the fir&s;t moments of cool reflexion. The remembrance mu&s;t wound him, and is an in&s;ult to me. He knows my weak|ne&s;s. It is no longer concealed as hi|therto in the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of my heart. All the world knows it. Even his mo|ther is no longer ignorant of the fatal &s;ecret; and what may &s;he not conclude from the circum&s;tances which have re|vealed it to her knowledge. Would to heaven I could hide my confu&s;ion and
<PB N="80" REF="83">
folly for ever from the whole earth. But even if I could, how &s;hall I ever conceal from my&s;elf the bitter, heart rending re|collection of my own imprudence.</P>
<P>I was almo&s;t frantic: and the moment I perceived the carriage drive off, I flew into my own room and &s;hut my&s;elf up. Fanny &s;oon followed, demanding admit|tance. But I could not for &s;ome time prevail with my&s;elf to grant it; for al|though my heart is &s;trongly and tenderly attached to her, a di&s;&s;imilarity of di&s;po|&s;ition, and the circum&s;tance of her being a married woman, which makes me ap|prehen&s;ive that her hu&s;band will be a &s;harer of all &s;he knows, renders my confidence in her neither &s;o comfortable nor &s;o undi&s;gui&s;ed as it would otherwi&s;e prove. I am not &s;o unju&s;t as to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he could ever be prevailed with to be|tray by the &s;lighte&s;t hint the &s;ecrets re|po&s;ed in her; but the openne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition renders me very &s;u&s;picious
<PB N="81" REF="84">
that &s;he might be imprudent without being con&s;cious of her error; and though I am thoroughly &s;atisfied that &s;he is as happy with Mr. Howard as it is po&s;&s;ible for any woman to be in the married &s;tate, yet I feel a degree of indelicacy in paint|ing anxieties and ardours which were &s;o wholly excluded her own court&s;hip, and which may for that rea&s;on appear roman|tic and unaccountable.</P>
<P>I partly confe&s;&s;ed however the di&s;a|greeable &s;ituation in which I found my|&s;elf involved; and without touching on the circum&s;tances of the drawing, and the declaration it had produced, which indeed I cannot recall to mind and could not have mentioned without angui&s;h un|&s;peakable, I owned I had met with Roat&s;ley that morning, and acknow|ledged the unea&s;ine&s;s which the little girl's raillery before his mother had oc|ca&s;ioned me.</P>
<P>I know not what to make of him,
<PB N="82" REF="85">
&s;aid Fanny: and undoubtedly this cou&s;in of ours after all is a little unaccountable; for as Mi&s;s Farnford ob&s;erved, his mi&s;|tre&s;s has &s;urely &s;ome rea&s;on to complain of his attentions in another quarter; and what can the man mean if he is actually on the eve of wedlock? I don't under|&s;tand his behaviour.</P>
<P>Alas! thought I, I under&s;tand his be|haviour but too well. It is my too ap|parent weakne&s;s and folly which have for a time produced in his heart a temporary incon&s;tancy. Oh, Sophia! how painful is this idea. All my pride of heart ri&s;es again&s;t it. I am &s;unk in my own opi|nion&mdash;I am humbled and mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>There is but one &s;tep to be taken, &s;aid I to my &s;i&s;ter. To &s;ee Lady Linro&s;e a|gain would be at pre&s;ent peculiarly di&s;a|greeable; and tho' &s;he gave at parting no intimation of a &s;peedy return, &s;he may very po&s;&s;ibly contrive to &s;ee us before &s;he leaves the county, which I own I
<PB N="83" REF="86">
would wi&s;h to avoid, and a very &s;imple and natural method of doing &s;o has oc|curred to me: I think of ha&s;tening my vi&s;it to our dear and valuable Lady Au|brey. It is but &s;etting off in a day or two in&s;tead of three weeks hence. I am &s;ure of finding her at home, and &s;hall this very day write to prepare her to ex|pect me.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, who has never been &s;eparat|ed from me for many years, and who di&s;|likes the idea of my leaving her even for a &s;hort time, made &s;ome little objections to this plan, alledging that Lady Lin|ro&s;e had reque&s;ted her vi&s;it might be kept a &s;ecret, from which it was naturally to be inferred that it was not likely to be &s;oon repeated.</P>
<P>I did not chu&s;e to own explicitly that it was the &s;on &s;till more than the mother that I wi&s;hed to avoid, tho' I told her that I thought I ought not to expo&s;e my|&s;elf to attentions that were (tho' I be|lieved
<PB N="84" REF="87">
unintentionally,) certainly an in|&s;ult to my character: and I &s;oon per&s;uad|ed her to acknowledge, if &s;uch were my &s;entiments, that I ought not to defer my journey.</P>
<P>The difficulty that now remained, was how to conceal my real motive from Mr. Howard: but happily a fortunate pre|tence &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf: in the even|ing, while we were chatting on the oc|currences of the day and the unexpected vi&s;it we had received, a letter was brought me from our dear and re&s;pected friend, telling me that her impatience to embrace us had ari&s;en to &s;uch a height, that &s;he intreated, if Mr. and Mrs. Howard's vi|&s;it mu&s;t &s;till be delayed, mine might be deferred no longer; reque&s;ting leave to &s;end her own carriage and &s;ervants to convey me &s;ately to Aubrey Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This kind, maternal epi&s;tle, would at all events have determined my compli|ance, e&s;pecially as Lady Meredith and
<PB N="85" REF="88">
Sir William, I find, have left the ca&s;tle, having been &s;uddenly recalled home: but at this time it is particularly agreea|ble, as it at once relieves me from my difficulties in regard to Mr. Howard, re|moves me from the chance of again meet|ing the man I &s;o anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h never more to behold, and offers me an oppor|tunity undi&s;turbed and at a di&s;tance, for combating the commotions of my mind.</P>
<P>I have written Lady Aubrey that I &s;hall be with her on Saturday evening. Her &s;eat is forty five miles di&s;tant; but by &s;etting off very early, I hope to ac|compli&s;h my journey without &s;leeping on the road, which I &s;hould di&s;like much.

<P>I Arrived here la&s;t night about nine in the evening. The moment I alighted, our dear Lady Aubrey ran out to meet me in the hall. She pre&s;&s;ed me to her bo&s;om in the tendere&s;t manner, and tears accompanied her embraces.</P>
<P>She led me to her dre&s;&s;ing room; where, after a thou&s;and anxious appre|hen&s;ions on her part in regard to the fa|tigue I had undergone in travelling, and as many kind enquiries after my &s;i&s;ter and Mr. Howard, I congratulated her with the mo&s;t heartfelt &s;atisfaction on the
<PB N="87" REF="90">
happy improvement of her health, indi|cated &s;o vi&s;ibly by the alteration in her looks.</P>
<P>The change is indeed &s;triking. That glow which health and tranquillity only can pre&s;erve, now throws a lu&s;tre over features, the intere&s;ting beauty of which &s;eemed before incapable of addition.</P>
<P>Both in mind and body, &s;aid that an|gelic woman, my amendment is wonder|ful: and how infinitely kind is it in my Hermione thus to &s;oothe my heart by gratifying my ardent wi&s;hes for her com|pany. My &s;pirits, thank heaven, are calm and equal; and my frame, at no period robu&s;t, begins to feel the plea&s;ing effects of internal peace and compo&s;ure. I do not allow my&s;elf to indulge the &s;e|clu&s;ion to which inclination &s;trongly im|pells me: on the contrary, I re&s;pect tho&s;e exactions which the rights of &s;ociety re|quire, and the neglect of which I, who have perhaps a long life before me, may
<PB N="88" REF="91">
yet live to regret. I intend to force my|&s;elf therefore to make proper returns to the vi&s;its and civilities paid me by my country neighbours; and have even al|ready begun to form an intimacy with a very worthy couple, who have hitherto waved all ceremony, and who have been repeatedly my gue&s;ts. They are at pre&s;ent with me; and though I &s;hould have much prefered the happine&s;s of &s;pending this evening tete a tete with you, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to allow them a &s;hare of your company.</P>
<P>She then conducted me to the draw|ing room, where we found a lady and gentleman engaged at picquet. She pre&s;ented me to both in the kinde&s;t man|ner. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, my dear Ma|dam, &s;aid &s;he to the lady, for leaving you my cards &s;o long, as I bring my apology along with me in this amiable young friend, who has relieved my ap|prehen&s;ions
<PB N="89" REF="92">
by making her appearance at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Supper was announced immediately after; and as I was fatigued and ex|hau&s;ted, Lady Aubrey, who&s;e &s;olicitude and anxiety made her watch every change of my countenance, in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould retire early to re&s;t; and making her excu&s;es to Mr. and Mrs. Berry, who &s;eem very &s;en&s;ible, agreeable people, &s;he led me to the chamber allotted me, where having ordered her maid to attend me, and &s;atisfied her&s;elf that every thing was prepared for my comfort and &s;atis|faction, &s;he tenderly embraced me and wi&s;hed me good night.</P>

<P>Ju&s;t as Lady Aubrey, her other gue&s;ts, and my&s;elf were a&s;&s;embled this day at dinner, the arrival of the po&s;tman with
<PB N="90" REF="93">
the new&s;papers induced Mr. Berry, who is a great politician, to hurry it over in order to read them aloud to the com|pany. His lady, who &s;eemed little amu&s;ed by the pro&s;pect of the parlia|mentary orations, reque&s;ted him to give us the news of the day before &s;he &s;et off on her rambles; and in compliance with her de&s;ire, he began the li&s;t of mortality, in which he &s;uddenly read the death of the Right Honourable Lord Linro&s;e at Lyons. I was extremely &s;hocked; though merely from compa&s;&s;ion for the friends who mu&s;t lament his lo&s;s; and Mr. Berry &s;eemed him&s;elf con&s;cious of having committed an impropriety in mentioning, in pre&s;ence of Lady Au|brey, a name that &s;eemed de&s;tined never again to reach her ears; for I remarked that his voice changed as he read, tho' he had the pre&s;ence of mind not to make his thoughts evident by &s;topping before he had fini&s;hed the &s;entence. Lady Au|brey
<PB N="91" REF="94">
&s;eemed &s;o much affected by the paragraph that &s;he &s;oon after left the room.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed much to follow her: but re|collecting that any private conver&s;ation at that moment mu&s;t naturally have led to &s;ubjects which I wi&s;h as much as po&s;|&s;ible in future to avoid, I forebore my intention; and when &s;he returned &s;ome time after into the room, I rejoiced that I had not given way to my fir&s;t impul&s;e, as though her eyes were red, &s;he con|ver&s;ed with a &s;edate chearfulne&s;s which te&s;tified her determination of combating all melancholy retro&s;pections that might lead to repining and de&s;pondency, and &s;oon after propo&s;ed conducting me thro' the different apartments of this elegant abode (the morning having been em|ployed at church) which infinitely &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed my expectations in point of mag|nificence. It is much too &s;pacious in my opinion for the re&s;idence of a &s;ingle,
<PB N="92" REF="95">
&s;olitary individual. However a large e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ervants, and a chearful &s;ituation, in a eat mea&s;ure atone for this defect, which Lady Aubrey her&s;elf remarked to me while we were &s;urvey|ing it. It is the &s;pot where my prede|ce&s;&s;ors have re&s;ided time immemorial, &s;aid &s;he; and my grandfather made it an article in his will that I &s;hould inhabit the hou&s;e, and not &s;uffer it to fall into decay.</P>
<P>There is a collection of mo&s;t valuable pictures; and a large library, where I intend pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal hours every day, &s;tored with the works of the be&s;t authors in all languages. I never was le&s;s in a mood for &s;tudy; but for that very rea|&s;on I mu&s;t endeavour to force a reli&s;h for every employment that bani&s;hes mu&s;ing.

<P>Our gue&s;ts left us to-day, which I regret much. Mrs. Berry &s;eldom leaves her family even for &s;o long a period as a few days, and her pre&s;ent vi&s;it was a particular compliment to Lady Aubrey, to whom I &s;u&s;pect &s;he and her hu&s;band have peculiar obligations.</P>
<P>I have received a letter from Fanny, dated Saturday evening. She writes to inform me of Lord Linro&s;e's death, with which &s;he had been made acquainted a few hours after I left her, by a note from Mr. Roat&s;ley, merely mentioning the event and the time it took place, as a piece of re&s;pect due to relations of the family. Mr. Howard, &s;he tells me, wrote a letter of condolence next morn|ing,
<PB N="94" REF="97">
to which he received a very kind reply, a&s;&s;uring him that nothing but the &s;hock he has received would have prevented his being at Hubert Hill long before now. Lord Belmont, he &s;ays, who has been &s;everely wounded by this blow, meant to &s;et off directly for Eng|land. He mu&s;t be already on his jour|ney, adds Mr. Roat&s;ley; and as I intend meeting him at Calais, I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall &s;oon merit his grateful acknow|ledgements for the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice I mean to confer upon him&mdash;that of con|&s;oling him in a great mea&s;ure for what death has &s;natched from his arms, by pre&s;enting to him relations who mu&s;t and who ought to be &s;o dear to his heart.</P>
<P>Fanny tells me, likewi&s;e, that &s;he hears. Lady Linro&s;e and her family are &s;oon to leave Holtenham Abbey, and to &s;et out for Northampton&s;hire. She makes no doubt, &s;he &s;ays, but Roat&s;ley will call at Hubert Hill before his departure. Poor
<PB N="95" REF="98">
Lady Linro&s;e, it &s;eems, is much afflic|ted; and their &s;tay with Lady Mary is to be no longer prolonged than till her Lady&s;hip's &s;pirits will admit of the ex|ertion of a removal.</P>
<P>This letter, which I received la&s;t night in Lady Aubrey's pre&s;ence, and which I withdrew to a window to read, threw an air of &s;uch depre&s;&s;ion over my countenance, that on turning round &s;he enquired with anxious apprehen&s;ion if all were well at Hubert Hill. This hint made me exert my&s;elf to appear chear|ful; but I fancy I could not boa&s;t of my &s;ucce&s;s. Since my arrival here Lady Aubrey has never recurred to tho&s;e pain|ful &s;ubjects which bur&s;t from her in the moments of agitation at Hubert Hill; and I could not have read my &s;i&s;ter's letter to her without calling back her thoughts to many di&s;mal reflections, the natural re&s;ult of being told that Lord Belmont was on his way to England.</P>

Lady Aubrey's conver&s;a|tion is a never failing &s;ource of intere&s;t and amu&s;ement. Her heart is &s;o bene|volent, and her under&s;tanding &s;o highly cultivated, that it is impo&s;&s;ible ever to tire in her company or de&s;ire other &s;o|ciety.

<PB N="100" REF="103">
brought me another letter from Fanny which arrived the day I left the Ca&s;tle. I be&s;ought her to write to me frequently, and &s;he has mo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly per|formed her promi&s;e. She tells me that Lord Linro&s;e, as he mu&s;t now be called, paid them that morning a vi&s;it. He &s;eems much affected by his brother's death, &s;he &s;ays, and looks extremely melancholy and depre&s;&s;ed. He expre&s;&s;ed in &s;trong terms his di&s;appointment at my ab&s;ence, and informed them he was to &s;et off for Calais on the 12th of July, where he expected by that time to find Lord Belmont already arrived; if not, his Lord&s;hip had &s;o &s;ettled his route that he &s;hould probably meet with him a &s;tage or two further on.</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e and the young ladies were next day to leave Holtenham Ab|bey. My &s;i&s;ter adds a circum&s;tance, for &s;he is very minute, which was be|fore unknown to me: I always imagined
<PB N="101" REF="104">
that Roat&s;ley had made one of the fa|mily at Lady Mary's, but &s;he mentions that he has merely vi&s;ited there from time to time during the di&s;tre&s;s of his mother and &s;i&s;ters, having lodged at the hou&s;e of his &s;teward (his own man&s;ion not yet being ready for his reception) who has a &s;mall farm on his e&s;tate. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome punctilio relating to his &s;ituation with Lady Elizabeth occa&s;ions this di&s;tance and formality.</P>
<P>This letter was accompanied by one from Mr. Howard, dated the day after, in which he informs me that the evening before Sir Edward Sudbury had paid him a vi&s;it. A compliment, &s;ays he, which is entirely to be laid to your ac|count; for nothing could exceed his evident di&s;appointment and regret on finding you were from home. After expre&s;&s;ing it in terms &s;ufficiently plain, he demanded a private conference with me, entreated my intere&s;t with you in
<PB N="102" REF="105">
his favour, and reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion on your return to repeat his vi&s;its as your declared admirer. I told him, conti|nues Mr. Howard, that all I could pro|mi&s;e him was my good wi&s;hes, as I was wholly ignorant of your &s;entiments in regard to him; nor could I undertake to further his &s;uit in any other manner than that of paving the way for his pro|po&s;al by preparing you for it. I likewi&s;e told him you was not expected home for many weeks, and perhaps might even remain ab&s;ent for a much longer period. Sir Edward eagerly caught at this propo&s;al; reque&s;ting I would lo&s;e no time in executing it, and de&s;iring me to acquaint you that he earne&s;tly entreats permi&s;&s;ion to attend you at Aubrey Ca&s;|tle.</P>
<P>Regarding my&s;elf as Sir Edward's agent, concludes Mr. Howard, I cannot avoid adding, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an excel|lent character, an affluent fortune, and a
<PB N="103" REF="106">
good figure and addre&s;s, any woman, who&s;e affections are not otherwi&s;e en|gaged, mu&s;t enjoy a fair pro&s;pect of hap|pine&s;s in an union with him.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce fini&s;hed reading this let|ter, when the bell &s;ummoned me to din|ner. Our party, large as it was, had gained the addition of &s;everal fox hunt|ing gentlemen, who &s;at down to table in their boots, with their cropped hair quite free from powder, and in a dre&s;s that would have di&s;graced their footmen. Being the fir&s;t of this cla&s;s I have &s;een, I was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed by their appear|ance, that I could not credit my ears, when Lady Hilbury, introducing one of them to me, called him Sir John &s;omething or other, for I have forgot his &s;urname.</P>

<P>The moment I was alone with Lady Aubrey la&s;t night, I mentioned to her the &s;ub&s;tance of Mr. Howard's letter. Well, my love, &s;aid &s;he, and pray what are the objections to the match? Are there any deficiencies in point of for|tune? If &s;o, ea&s;ily can the&s;e be removed; for is not my Hermione my own child; the child of my bo&s;om; and &s;he embraced me affectionately.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly &s;atisfied her that the ob|&s;tacles again&s;t it re&s;ulted merely from the feelings of my heart, which were wholly repugnant to the union; and a thou&s;and times I thanked her for the kind adoption; a tye which I told her, and told her with &s;incerity, I had nei|ther wi&s;h nor intention of weakening by any other that might divide my affections.</P>
<P>I am much mi&s;taken, &s;aid &s;he &s;miling,
<PB N="105" REF="108">
and looking me earne&s;tly in the face, if my Hermione's heart is formed for the reception of no warmer &s;entiments than tho&s;e a fond mother can hope to excite.</P>
<P>A blu&s;h of con&s;cious confe&s;&s;ion tinged my cheeks. I replied that Sir Edward, at lea&s;t, never would rival that dear mo|ther in my heart; nor could I per&s;uade my&s;elf that any attachment, however violent, would for an in&s;tant dimini&s;h or interfere with that &s;ervent affection for her which con&s;tituted almo&s;t the fir&s;t happine&s;s of my exi&s;tence: and indeed, Sophia, I did not exaggerate my feelings in expre&s;&s;ing them thus warmly; for my unexpected intimacy with this angelic woman has produced an intere&s;t that &s;upports my &s;inking &s;pirits and feels like the acqui&s;ition of a new &s;en&s;e that gives life and energy to all the others.</P>
<P>Well, my love, &s;aid &s;he, I live in hopes of one day witne&s;&s;ing that you make good your promi&s;e. If I lo&s;e <HI>your</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="109">
regard I lo&s;e all that attaches me to my pre&s;ent &s;tate of being. But I am not &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as to de&s;ire to engro&s;s it wholly. Your felicity is my fir&s;t and deare&s;t wi&s;h; and I would not &s;ecure my own at the price of dimini&s;hing yours. I hope therefore to &s;ee you happily &s;ettled, in that &s;tate which undoubtedly is capable of producing, and often does be&s;tow, the highe&s;t degree of comfort.</P>
<P>I have written in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to Mr. Howard, reque&s;ting him to inform Sir Edward that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to grant permi&s;&s;ion for a vi&s;it which would put him to the trouble of a fruit|le&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary journey.</P>

Lady Aubrey has con&s;ulted an able phy&s;ician here, who has a&s;&s;ured her there is nothing in the lea&s;t alarming in my complaint, and has pre&s;cribed early hours, regularity of living, and a&s;&s;es milk, which re&s;toratives are to be pro|cured with much greater ea&s;e and conve|nience at Aubrey Ca&s;tle, than in this ho&s;|pitable family; where the con&s;tant bu&s;tle of a number of people, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to the e&s;tabli&s;hed hours, prevents that compo&s;ure and quiet &s;o &s;a|lutary to weak health.

<P>Were I in better &s;pirits, I might divert you not a little with an account of the different people I have met with &s;ince our abode here, particularly with this fox hunting baronet, Sir John Bennet, who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf my admirer, tho' our acquaintance has not been of above a few days &s;tanding, and who makes down|right love to Lady Aubrey, in hopes &s;he will give him an invitation to Aubrey Ca&s;tle.

She is not yet thirty &s;ix; and tho' the &s;tile of dre&s;s in which &s;he indulges, indicates a more advanced period, her countenance is uncommonly youthful.</P>

<P>I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed to-day on enter|ing the drawing room to find Sir Edward Sudbury. As it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible he could have been made acquainted with the contents of my reply to Mr. How|ard's letter, which was only &s;ent away on Friday la&s;t, I knew not what to make of this vi&s;it, which he &s;oon took an oppor|tunity of in&s;inuating had been the &s;udden con&s;equence of his being accidentally in|formed that I was at Hilbury Lodge, with which family he is intimately ac|quainted. I &s;uppo&s;e he mu&s;t have con|&s;idered permi&s;&s;ion to wait on me at Au|brey Ca&s;tle at lea&s;t as very precarious; and I imagine regarded this circum&s;tance as a favourable opportunity for urging his &s;uit without unpolitene&s;s or impropri|ety.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="113">I endeavoured, by the gravity and re|&s;erve with which I attended to him, to explain what reception his propo&s;al was likely to receive, and if po&s;&s;ible to deter him from a pur&s;uit that could only be &s;ucceeded by mortification and unea&s;i|ne&s;s; but Sir Edward was in unbounded &s;pirits, and would take no hint that &s;eemed repugnant to his wi&s;hes. When our departure to-morrow however was accidentally mentioned by Lady Hilbury in the cour&s;e of the evening, a cloud &s;uddenly overca&s;t poor Sir Edward's countenance, his vivacity for&s;ook him, and with a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive but melan|choly countenance he &s;eized a moment while the company were &s;ettling their card parties, to reque&s;t leave to have the honour of attending us, and be&s;ought that I would allow him to entreat Lady Aubrey's permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I told him gravely that it was wholly out of my power to grant his reque&s;t.
<PB N="111" REF="114">
The apprehen&s;ion of deceiving him, and the de&s;ire of putting a &s;peedy period to hopes which deluded only to render the di&s;appointment more painful, made me pronounce the&s;e few words in a voice &s;o determined, that my heart in&s;tantly re|proached me for the pain I was con&s;train|ed to inflict; while it's &s;ecret feelings explained to me &s;o powerfully what Sir Edward's mu&s;t prove. I therefore added, tho' with equal &s;teadine&s;s, that I &s;hould always remain &s;en&s;ible of the favour he intended me.</P>
<P>Having forced my&s;elf to be thus ex|plicit, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as it was, I ha&s;tily turned away; and Sir Edward, thunder|&s;truck at my prohibition, in&s;tantly left the room. He did not appear for &s;ome hours; and during the whole evening repeated enquiries of where he could be, and expre&s;&s;ions of wonder what he could have done with him&s;elf, were made by the whole company.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="115">Sir Edward at length entered; but not till we were all &s;eated at &s;upper. He &s;upported the general attack with much embarra&s;&s;ment; and &s;aid in excu&s;e for his ab&s;ence, that he had been enjoying this delightful evening along the &s;ide of the canal. This occa&s;ioned much mirth. The refinement of his ta&s;te was admired, his neglect of the ladies at the card party heartily laughed at, and finally it was de|termined that, as the &s;ole excu&s;e his fail|ure in politene&s;s would admit of, he mu&s;t make a formal acknowledgment to the company that he was deeply involved in a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, in which ca&s;e only the ladies agreed to accord him their forgive|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>How Sir Edward looked, on this rail|lery, I know not, for I was little le&s;s confu&s;ed than him&s;elf, and did not once dare to throw my eyes that way. His awkwardne&s;s was matter of additional entertainment; and &s;ince he would not
<PB N="113" REF="116">
make a verbal confe&s;&s;ion, Lady Hilbury told him his &s;ilence &s;hould be taken as proof po&s;itive.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey, with her u&s;ual huma|nity, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at this per&s;ecution, fortu|nately relieved poor Sir Edward by hint|ing a wi&s;h to retire early on account of our journey to-morrow; and we &s;epara|ted at lea&s;t an hour &s;ooner than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>I attended her to her dre&s;&s;ing room&punc; where di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her maid&mdash;I cannot help being rather &s;urpri&s;ed, my dear, &s;aid &s;he. This Sir Edward appears a very amiable young man, and his behaviour this even|ing convinces me that he is tenderly at|tached to you. Is your determination &s;till to reject him? does your heart &s;ay nothing in his favour?</P>
<P>Oh! nothing, nothing indeed, cried I. I pity and feel for his di&s;appoint|ment; but to be his wife would render me mi&s;erable for ever.</P>
<P>I &s;poke with &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary warmth, when I had been li&s;tening to no argu|ments
<PB N="114" REF="117">
that could have rou&s;ed my oppo|&s;ition, and had no &s;olicitations to appre|hend from the tenderne&s;s of my dear La|dy Aubrey, that &s;he looked at me &s;ome moments with a face of perplexity. Then heaven forbid you &s;hould be his wife, my love. I do not mean to become the ad|vocate of a man of whom I have &s;een &s;o little. I am too con&s;cious of the ine&s;ti|mable value of my Hermione's heart, not to be as nice in my choice of the man on whom &s;he is to be&s;tow it, as &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly be for her&s;elf. I am only &s;urpri&s;ed that a heart, young, warm, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic, which has been in a manner &s;ecluded from intercour&s;e with mankind, and which cannot for that rea&s;on have been either tainted with the vanity of general admiration or deluded with the de&s;tructive idea that in high birth and titles a gratification is to be &s;ought, un|attainable in a more moderate &s;phere: I am &s;urpri&s;ed, I repeat, that a heart like
<PB N="115" REF="118">
yours &s;hould have remained unmoved by the a&s;&s;iduities of a man, who&s;e outward appearance &s;peaks &s;o highly in his favor, and who&s;e character you allow to be e&s;ti|mable and even amiable.</P>
<P>To this ob&s;ervation I could make no an&s;wer. To a friend &s;o dear, &s;o re&s;pect|able, &s;o kindly and warmly intere&s;ted in my felicity, to have given an eva&s;ive and di&s;ingenuous reply, was impo&s;&s;ible. Gra|titude and affection condemned the very idea. Yet to make a confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate of my affections, to avow that a &s;e|cret and hopele&s;s attachment devoured my peace, de&s;troyed my health, and &s;teeled my heart again&s;t the &s;olicitations of all men but one, was equally impracti|cable. Oh Sophia! &s;uch an avowal mu&s;t have been &s;o humiliating, &s;o pain|fully &s;evere, it mu&s;t have led be&s;ides to a train of particulars &s;o interwoven with Lady Aubrey's misfortunes, that this act of confidence might have given no le&s;s pain to her feelings than it mu&s;t have
<PB N="116" REF="119">
conveyed to mine. After he&s;itating therefore for a moment, whether from re&s;pect due to the beloved friend who honoured me with the name of daughter, I &s;hould not throw my&s;elf into her arms and in&s;tantly confe&s;s my weakne&s;s, I found that love was to her a &s;ubject I could not force my&s;elf to mention.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas, which pa&s;&s;ed with the ve|locity of lightning through my mind, &s;ealed up my lips; and Lady Aubrey perceiving that I was embarra&s;&s;ed, ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to go to re&s;t, and kindly wi&s;hed me a good night, which afforded me an opportunity of retiring. I am convinced however, that painful as might have been the communication, I &s;hould undoubtedly have avowed all at that mo|ment had not the above mentioned ap|prehen&s;ion deterred me.</P>
<P>On entering my chamber, I perceived a letter directed for me; which I found was the fruits of Sir Edward's moonlight
<PB N="117" REF="120">
meditations, and mu&s;t have con&s;iderably &s;hortened his walk. I &s;uppo&s;e he had bribed one of the maids to lay it on my toilet.</P>

<P>WE are returned here, to my inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction; and if the pertur|bation of my &s;pirits will allow of any kind of method or connexion in my nar|rative, pray receive the particulars which occurred immediately on our arrival.</P>
<P>We &s;et off early on Monday la&s;t. Poor
<PB N="118" REF="121">
Sir Edward! his unea&s;ine&s;s at &s;eeing us depart was very apparent. But as I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to more intere&s;ting circum&s;tances, I &s;hall merely tell you, that having in his letter de&s;ired leave to receive his &s;entence, as he called it, from Lady Aubrey's lips, I intreated her at once to put a final period to his &s;uit; which &s;he accordingly contrived to do during a &s;hort walk on the terrace after breakfa&s;t. He was much &s;hocked, &s;he &s;aid, but &s;eemed to regard his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion as po&s;itive and un|alterable.</P>
<P>We arrived pretty late at the ca&s;tle. Lady Aubrey, after ordering tea, of which &s;he is particularly fond, left the room to give &s;ome family orders, and &s;oon after the hou&s;ekeeper entered and pre|&s;ented to me a letter, which &s;he told me had been brought three days after my departure, by a &s;ervant, who finding I was from home, enquired when I was ex|pected to return; and being informed
<PB N="119" REF="122">
that our ab&s;ence was only de&s;igned for a week at mo&s;t, he left it in &s;trict charge to the hou&s;ekeeper, telling her it mu&s;t be given into Mi&s;s Seymour's own hands, and reque&s;ting particular care might be taken of it.</P>
<P>This appearance of precaution con|veyed an idea into the good woman that probably the letter contained bills for money; which &s;u&s;picion induced her, in|&s;tead of &s;ending it by po&s;t to Hilbury Lodge, on finding our &s;tay prolonged, to lock it carefully in her drawer till our ar|rival &s;hould put it in her power to di&s;|charge her tru&s;t faithfully.</P>
<P>A gentleman, &s;he added, had called that very morning, and having enquired for the hou&s;ekeeper, had a&s;ked what was become of the letter given into her hands by a &s;ervant a fortnight before; and finding we were that day expected, had reque&s;ted her to pre&s;ent it to me imme|diately on my arrival.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="123">This prelude alarmed me, tho' I knew not why. The woman withdrew: I open|ed it in trepidation: and what was my a&s;toni&s;hment and agitation on perceiving the &s;ignature of Linro&s;e.

<P>When I con&s;ider that perhaps at this moment&punc; Mi&s;s Seymour does me the in|ju&s;tice to imagine me the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, the mo&s;t ungrateful of mankind, I trem|ble to addre&s;s her; and when I reflect, that from an unhappy fatality of events it is not impo&s;&s;ible but that to the&s;e ac|cu&s;ations, cruel and injurious, may be &s;uperadded tho&s;e of incon&s;i&s;tency and duplicity, I am wholly bereft of the compo&s;ure with which I &s;hould wi&s;h to enter on an explanation of my conduct.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, is it then po&s;&s;ible that
<PB N="121" REF="124">
you &s;u&s;pect not only the tenderne&s;s of my heart but its honour and integrity; that you conclude me &s;o devoid of prin|ciple, &s;o lo&s;t to &s;hame, as to offer vows to you which are the right of another. Ah! lovelie&s;t, mo&s;t amiable of women! &s;ink me not in my own e&s;timation by acknowledging I was ever for an in&s;tant depraved &s;o low in your's. Believe me not capable of a deed &s;o ba&s;e; a deed&mdash; for which violence of pa&s;&s;ion and force of temptation, even of &s;uch temptation as in that ca&s;e I mu&s;t have had to en|counter, afford but impotent and feeble palliations. No, Madam, had I been fet|tered by the &s;lighte&s;t ties, had my heart &s;ought to in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the bo&s;om of &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;ucce&s;s afterwards un|gratefully &s;ickened me at the pur&s;uit, my love, my adoration of Mi&s;s Seymour, might have tortured my bo&s;om, but ne|ver &s;hould it have pa&s;&s;ed my lips.</P>
<P>A chain of particulars, too intricate,

too tedious for di&s;tant di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, has led to the unfortunate and mi&s;taken no|tion of my approaching union&mdash;particu|lars which, when I have the honour of &s;eeing you, I hope you will have the goodne&s;s to allow me to explain; in the mean while, for the &s;ake of heaven, per|mit me to exi&s;t by the flattering hope, that the cruel and &s;udden rever&s;e in your behaviour, from &s;oftne&s;s the mo&s;t cap|tivating, the mo&s;t angelic, to the colde&s;t &s;everity and mo&s;t barbarous re&s;erve, owed its &s;ource &s;olely to this perplexing report. Forgive me, Mi&s;s Seymour, for recalling your thoughts to recollections, which, da&s;hed as they are with bitterne&s;s, dwell on my memory with &s;en&s;ations of de|light, gratitude, and exultation, that ne|ver, but with my la&s;t expiring &s;igh can be era&s;ed from my heart: yet what a painful allay &s;ucceeded to this moment of happine&s;s! your downca&s;t look, and &s;ilent ha&s;te to e&s;cape from me, were not

the blu&s;hing effects of the timid and dif|fident regret with which you reflected on the &s;oftne&s;s you could not wholly and cruelly di&s;gui&s;e from the man who adored you, and who, &s;upplicating at your feet, claimed &s;urely &s;ome little &s;en&s;ibility to a pa&s;&s;ion that has &s;o long proved the de|&s;truction of his peace. Ah no! the&s;e amiable &s;ufferings had already inflicted too much pain, had already encrea&s;ed if po&s;&s;ible my enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration, even while I lamented their poignancy and partook of the unea&s;ine&s;s they occa&s;ioned you. No! you &s;u&s;pected my honour, you believed me unworthy of your &s;lighte&s;t regard; and a rigour the mo&s;t inflexible taking place of &s;ofter emotions, barred every avenue to your heart and rendered it inacce&s;&s;ible to all my prayers and entreaties.</P>
<P>Why this vindication was not earlier attempted may probably &s;urpri&s;e you. But while your behaviour perplexed and

tormented me, this explanation of its &s;everity never once occurred to my ima|gination; till it was this day happily &s;ugge&s;ted, from having been informed that the rumours re&s;pecting my engage|ments were &s;o &s;erious and &s;o current as to gain univer&s;al credit.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Seymour may believe, that after par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing from her at a moment &s;o arduous, I did not mean to allow twenty four hours to elap&s;e without imploring her to acquaint me wherein I had had the misfortune to offend her: on the con|trary I intended to have written from Holtenham Abbey, where I was engaged to &s;pend the day, to have demanded my accu&s;ation and ju&s;tified my&s;elf in her opinion; but on my arrival there, which was not till late, what a &s;cene awaited me&mdash;my mother and &s;i&s;ters had ju&s;t re|ceived the account of my brother's death; and in the fir&s;t moments of de|&s;pair, were weeping over the letter that

To Mi&s;s Seymour, I am not afraid to confe&s;s, that this &s;evere &s;troke drove for &s;ome time all other ideas from my thoughts; even her beloved image was ob&s;cured, and every tender recollection &s;upplanted by grief: but reflections &s;o long cheri&s;hed, &s;o dear to the heart, cannot long lie dormant in the mind; and I &s;oon found that the amiable &s;ource of all my hopes and expectations of hap|pine&s;s in life, could alone heal the wounds which death had inflicted.</P>
<P>In acquainting my friends at Hubert Hill with this misfortune, I imagined I offered a &s;ufficient apology both for my &s;ilence and my ab&s;ence: but what was my concern this day, upon vi&s;iting them, to find that at near fifty miles di&s;tance, you mu&s;t have remained for &s;everal days ignorant of the melancholy event that had rendered me incapable of paying you my devoirs.

<P><PB N="127" REF="130">The tumult of my mind on peru&s;ing this a&s;toni&s;hing letter was unutterable. My &s;en&s;es were almo&s;t annihilated; and a &s;en&s;ation of di&s;tru&s;t and con&s;ternation half per&s;uaded me to doubt if what I read really came from the hands of Lord Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of perturbation I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed by Lady Aubrey, who entered the drawing room while I was &s;o wholly ab&s;orbed in &s;ecret gratitude and delight, that uncon&s;cious of ob&s;ervation, I re|peated aloud, cla&s;ping my hands toge|ther, good God! is it po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>My dear, cried &s;he, approaching in ha&s;te, &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ituation in which &s;he beheld me&mdash;for heaven's &s;ake tell me what is the matter?</P>
<P>This que&s;tion awakened me from the confu&s;ion that had &s;eized all my facul|ties. But unable to reply, I could only an&s;wer by pre&s;&s;ing the hand that had &s;o kindly &s;eized mine.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="131">My agitation a&s;toni&s;hed and alarmed her: for the two extremes of plea&s;ure and di&s;tre&s;s, are upon a cur&s;ory view very &s;imilar in their effects. She imagined &s;ome &s;udden calamity had overwhelmed me; and pre&s;&s;ing me with &s;ympathetic tenderne&s;s to her bo&s;om, entreated me to tell her what had given me &s;o much pain.</P>
<P>I could not avoid &s;miling at the ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and ha&s;tened to acquaint her that I had no &s;ubject for unea&s;ine&s;s. I blu&s;h for my&s;elf, deare&s;t Madam, &s;aid I; but you I well know will be all indul|gence to the weakne&s;s which in a mo|ment of &s;uch un&s;peakable agitation I am unable to overcome. I have a long, long tale to di&s;clo&s;e to you. My heart has been humbled, mortified, and op|pre&s;&s;ed; and I am certain your goodne&s;s will allow of &s;ome excu&s;e in the &s;udden, &s;oothing relief it has &s;o unexpectedly re|ceived.</P>
<P>That tale can never appear long to me,
<PB N="129" REF="132">
of which my Hermione is the heroine. But do &s;it down and compo&s;e your&s;elf. I believe I can almo&s;t gue&s;s the mo&s;t material points of the &s;tory. Is there not a hero in the tale, my love? at lea&s;t &s;o I have long &s;u&s;pected; though I for|bore giving you the pain of &s;oliciting your confidence, which I was certain would not have been denied me but for particular rea&s;ons that mu&s;t have ren|dered the communication di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Oh! Madam, I will tell you all, cried I, penetrated with her goodne&s;s; and be a&s;&s;ured no ungrateful doubt of your kind &s;ympathy and indulgence induced me to lock up my &s;ecret pangs in my own bo|&s;om. Ah! no! diffidence and ba&s;hful|ne&s;s alone at fir&s;t deterred me from en|tering upon &s;o awkward a &s;ubject; and afterwards, &s;ince my re&s;idence here, I have not only anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed that all the world might remain in ignorance of what has pa&s;&s;ed, but that if po&s;&s;ible I
<PB N="130" REF="133">
might bani&s;h it for ever from my own remembrance.</P>
<P>But as your pa&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s &s;eems, if I may judge from the intelligence of your countenanance, to have given way to happier pro&s;pects, I hope you are going to have the goodne&s;s to &s;atisfy my cu|rio&s;ity. The man who has created &s;uch ravages in the bo&s;om of my Hermione has no little rea&s;on to be vain, and I am convinced mu&s;t merit the di&s;tinction, el&s;e he would not have enjoyed it; but pray tell me who is he? I cannot po&s;&s;ibly have &s;een him, yet I feel I am already in his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>He is one of my relations, Madam, an&s;wered I, he&s;itating. He is my cou|&s;in; and the grand&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P>Of Lord Belmont, interrupted Lady Aubrey. I have frequently heard of the young man while abroad, and his friends talked loudly in his favour; and though my connection with the family has been
<PB N="131" REF="134">
long laid a&s;ide, I have ever retained &s;e|cretly in my heart a &s;trong and lively partiality for the good old man and all his children. A tear ru&s;hed into her eye as &s;he &s;poke. The hu&s;band of Hermi|one, continued &s;he, mu&s;t ever have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed my warme&s;t regard, but I &s;hall not love him le&s;s, for the many recollec|tions&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh! Madam! cried I, &s;obbing in her arms, for the &s;ake of heaven bani&s;h all painful recollections. Let the pa&s;t be &s;unk in oblivion. Look only forward. Think of nothing but the con&s;olation, the &s;alutary comfort which a heart like your's is formed to experience from the unalterable duty, gratitude, and affec|tion of tho&s;e highly favoured children of your adoption, who honour you with filial piety and love you with enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervour.</P>
<P>Be not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, recovering her &s;edate compo&s;ure; my
<PB N="132" REF="135">
heart is far from &s;ad at this moment. How indeed &s;hould it be &s;o at a moment when my daughter's countenance bright|ens with &s;ecret complacency through her tears.</P>
<P>She then once more entreated me to be explicit; and beginning at the epocha of our rencontre in the packet boat, I related &s;incerely and without di&s;gui&s;e every circum&s;tance in which Lord Lin|ro&s;e has been concerned.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey li&s;tened with the kind|e&s;t and mo&s;t anxious &s;olicitude, and en|tered with intere&s;t into all my emotions. She felt for my di&s;appointments, re|joiced when any intervals of gratification &s;eemed to afford me a recompence for my &s;ufferings, exulted at the genero&s;ity of Lord Linro&s;e's conduct, and &s;hed tears at Lord Belmont's cruelty. He is reckoned by many a rigid character, &s;aid &s;he, but to me he was ever all gentlene&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion; and even his faults I
<PB N="133" REF="136">
am convinced have their origin in virtue. He is &s;trict, and perhaps may be e&s;teemed &s;evere; but that &s;everity is the re&s;ult of a rectitude of heart, which being &s;ub|ject to few weakne&s;&s;es, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es little indulgence for errors it never knew. His benevolence is warm, and his feelings but too keen. Where they have &s;uf|fered from the mi&s;conduct of others, his re&s;entment is proportioned to what he has endured. But his conduct in regard to his grand children is by no means in tone with the general tenor of his prin|ciples, which are founded on &s;trict ju&s;|tice and unbia&s;&s;ed integrity. It leads me to imagine that &s;ome previous pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have taken root in his mind; and it is not unlikely that Lady Linro&s;e (being her&s;elf deceived) may have occa&s;ioned or at lea&s;t confirmed this di&s;gu&s;t, even without the &s;lighte&s;t deliberate de&s;ign of injuring your cau&s;e. At all events, on his arrival all can be
<PB N="134" REF="137">
ea&s;ily and effectually explained; and you have now but little rea&s;on to dread his inflexibility while you po&s;&s;e&s;s an advo|cate &s;o thoroughly well di&s;po&s;ed as Lord Linro&s;e, to exert all his rhetoric in your behalf.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t &s;atisfied her in regard to the part Lady Linro&s;e has acted, and con|cluded my narrative, acknowledging my a&s;toni&s;hment and perturbation on re|ceiving an explanation &s;o unlooked for of the &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tencies in Lord Lin|ro&s;e's conduct, when a note was brought me from him. He was, as I had &s;u&s;|pected from the hou&s;ekeeper's account, and as his own letter led me to imagine, on his way to Dover; and wrote from the inn, on the great road, about four miles from this place.</P>
<P>He laments his di&s;appointment on finding I was not yet returned when he called this morning, and reque&s;ts leave
<PB N="135" REF="138">
to be allowed to wait on me to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>The moment I had read this note, I gave it to Lady Aubrey, who de&s;ired me to offer her compliments to his Lord|&s;hip, and to reque&s;t in her name the fa|vour of his company to-morrow at break|fa&s;t.</P>
<P>I then withdrew to my dre&s;&s;ing room to an&s;wer it. Glad of a pretext for be|ing a few moments alone, I threw my|&s;elf into a chair, and gave way to a reve|rie of the mo&s;t enchanting nature. What a revolution in my mind had a few hours effected! What a rever&s;e, from the de|pre&s;&s;ion that had but that very morning almo&s;t wholly overpowered me! My &s;pi|rits were elated to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m; and I thanked the Almighty with a fer|vour till now unfelt for the delightful pro&s;pect that on all &s;ides &s;urrounded me. I &s;at down at length to my bureau. Had my pen followed the dictates of my heart,
<PB N="136" REF="139">
I knew I &s;hould have committed my note to the flames in&s;tead of &s;ending it away; yet I could not affect a cold ceremony, &s;o oppo&s;ite to my own feelings and to that affection which Lord Linro&s;e had de|clared in terms of &s;uch warmth. Here is what I was obliged to re&s;t &s;atisfied with at la&s;t.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment on having a letter from Lord Linro&s;e put this evening into my hands immediately upon my return to Aubrey Ca&s;tle. I will not affect a re&s;erve &s;o foreign to my feelings, and &s;o injurious to the favoura|ble &s;entiments with which your Lord&s;hip honours me, as to deny that my &s;urpri&s;e at its contents was not unmixed with plea&s;ure, and that the peru&s;al relieved me from much perplexity and even unea&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Having di&s;patched my note, I re|turned to Lady Aubrey. Oh! Sophia! how amiable, how exalted is this woman! Her &s;pirits were this evening exhilerated even to gaiety, her eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure, and the agonizing recollections, which remembrance might be &s;uppo&s;ed on this occa&s;ion to have naturally renewed, were wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or rather &s;up|planted by the pro&s;pect of my approach|ing happine&s;s. She a&s;ked me a thou|&s;and que&s;tions in regard to Lord Lin|ro&s;e,
<PB N="138" REF="141">
made me minutely de&s;cribe his per&s;on, and in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;hewing her a little &s;ketch on ivory, which at Hil|bury Lodge &s;oothed many a melancholy hour, but which I had at length deter|mined to de&s;troy as it afforded an in&s;inua|ting indulgence extremely ill adapted to that victory over my &s;en&s;ibility which I have &s;o often attempted without &s;ucce&s;s. This preliminary towards conquering my weakne&s;s, you will perhaps &s;agely ob|&s;erve, ought to have been the fir&s;t &s;tep. I grant it; but indeed you mu&s;t be pre|ci&s;ely in my &s;ituation before you can prove an adequate judge of the difficul|ties of &s;uch a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>We &s;eparated early; and I have been writing while I ought to have been in bed. But I have little chance of &s;leep|ing; though the weakne&s;s of my frame at pre&s;ent renders the agitations of the day &s;o violent on my &s;pirits, that I feel quite exhau&s;ted, and think of to-morrow's
<PB N="139" REF="142">
interview even with &s;ome degree of ap|prehen&s;ion. Yes, Sophia; for is not there &s;omething formidable in the idea of &s;eeing Lord Linro&s;e after the weakne&s;s of my behaviour at our la&s;t meeting.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JULY 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I had no inclination to &s;leep when I gave over writing la&s;t night, but I began to con&s;ider that if I did not contrive to get a few hours re&s;t after the mental and bodily fatigues of the preceding day, I &s;hould look &s;till more like a gho&s;t than I already do; and really you never beheld any thing &s;o pale and &s;o ugly as I am grown of late.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect however my complexion was &s;ufficiently florid this morning, when Lord Linro&s;e entered the breakfa&s;ting parlour; where dreading the formality
<PB N="140" REF="143">
of being called down to him, I rather cho&s;e to be ready to receive him.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey was not yet &s;tirring, &s;o that we were tete a tete. But I cannot give you all the particulars of our con|ver&s;ation. A love interview, except to the parties immediately concerned, is al|ways ab&s;urd; but I fancy you will &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect that I found nothing extremely ridiculous in the eager urgen|cy with which Lord Linro&s;e, after an explanation the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned, en|treated my permi&s;&s;ion to apply to Lord Belmont for his con&s;ent and approbation, the in&s;tant he found a favourable oppor|tunity for intere&s;ting him&s;elf in my af|fairs, tho' my confu&s;ion during part of the &s;cene might perhaps have afforded <HI>you</HI> &s;ome amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>He &s;poke with &s;uch feeling of my &s;e|verity, as he called it, and of my conde|&s;cention with &s;o many expre&s;&s;ions of gra|titude and obligation, that he half ba|ni&s;hed
<PB N="141" REF="144">
the &s;hame which the recollection recalled; but I be&s;ought him never more to mention, and if po&s;&s;ible to forget, all that had pa&s;&s;ed</P>
<P>I think, cried he &s;miling, I &s;hall find it no ea&s;y matter to comply with that in|junction; for I have ab&s;olutely exi&s;ted upon the remembrance ever &s;ince I had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you; and un|doubtedly you cannot have the cruelty to wi&s;h to deprive me of the memory of one ble&s;&s;ed moment that recompen&s;ed me for the angui&s;h of the tedious hours that &s;ucceeded. Oh! Mi&s;s Seymou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">! added he, how could you leave me with &s;uch frigid abruptne&s;s? how could you poi&s;on and embitter the joy with which the delightful di&s;covery of your pitying &s;ympathy had overwhelmed me? Yet what mu&s;t your opinion have been of me during the unhappy period of my &s;ilence? how mu&s;t you have de&s;pi&s;ed the man, who one day vowing eternal fidelity at
<PB N="142" REF="145">
your feet with all the urgency of pa&s;&s;ion|ate affection, could the next apparently relinqui&s;h his hopes, and abandon a pur|&s;uit to which a reward, a prize is annext, that may well fix the mo&s;t fickle and ani|mate the mo&s;t phlegmatic lover, that ever pretended to the pa&s;&s;ion. Alas! you knew not the blow, which from over|powering my &s;pirits rendered me for &s;ome little time wholly incapable even of ex|plaining my&s;elf on this intere&s;ting &s;ub|ject; till a vi&s;it from Brad&s;haw, a few days after, led me in the confidence of friend&s;hip partly to confe&s;s to him my &s;i|tuation in regard to you. I owned that a fortunate moment had in&s;pired me with courage to declare the pa&s;&s;ion, which he well knew had &s;o long tormented me with all the mi&s;ery of continual appre|hen&s;ion, doubt, and unea&s;ine&s;s. I ac|knowledged that Mi&s;s Seymour had li&s;|tened to me with angelic &s;oftne&s;s; but that her behaviour had all at once be|trayed
<PB N="143" REF="146">
a di&s;plea&s;ure for which &s;he had not deigned to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e; and that &s;he had left me with abrupt ha&s;te, notwith|&s;tanding my mo&s;t earne&s;t intreaties only for a few moments &s;tay.</P>
<P>Brad&s;haw at once cleared up my doubts, enabled me to comprehend what had appeared &s;o unaccountably my&s;teri|ous, and by informing me of the credit with which the report of my marriage has been circulated (a report, he told me, which even Mi&s;s Seymour her&s;elf had once hinted to him) enabled me by an immediate explanation to relieve my own mind and convince her's of the in|ju&s;tice of her &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip then entered more fully into the particulars which have given ri&s;e to this idea. Circum&s;tances, &s;aid he, have lately di&s;covered to me that Lord Mortonbury and my grandfather very early formed the plan of a connection between Lady Elizabeth and my&s;elf.
<PB N="144" REF="147">
The young lady's rank, fortune, and ac|compli&s;hments, undoubtedly render her an object of &s;ingular importance to tho&s;e who look in matrimony for nothing be|yond &s;uch advantages; and Lord Bel|mont flattered him&s;elf the friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two families, by affording opportunities for frequent intercour&s;e, would facilitate his wi&s;hes. This plan however, like mo&s;t others which re&s;t on adventitious events, failed of &s;ucce&s;s; my early intimacy with Lady Elizabeth, far from promoting warmer &s;entiments, merely &s;erved to di&s;|cover to me tho&s;e little foibles which in a le&s;&s;er or greater degree pervade every human character, but which in her no tender partiality on my part either pal|liated or concealed. Lady Elizabeth's errors, though not of a more unamiable nature than tho&s;e of mo&s;t women of her rank who have received a &s;imilar educa|tion, were particularly ill &s;uited to my
<PB N="145" REF="148">
di&s;po&s;ition, and to tho&s;e views of dome&s;|tic felicity to which, even in my mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated moments, my wi&s;hes have in|variably pointed; and &s;oon &s;u&s;picious of my grandfather's views, which mu&s;t have utterly de&s;troyed all my future pro&s;pects of happine&s;s and which I found every individual of the family &s;o anxiou&s;ly de|&s;ired, &s;ince my la&s;t return from the Continent, I have uniformly endeavoured by the mo&s;t re&s;pectful di&s;tance to demon|&s;trate that I did not pre&s;ume to regard my&s;elf as entitled to offer my addre&s;&s;es to one of the fir&s;t heire&s;&s;es in England.</P>
<P>Some weeks ago, however, I received a letter from Lord Belmont, in plain terms propo&s;ing the match to my con|&s;ideration, and repre&s;enting it to me in all tho&s;e glowing colours which a favour|ite plan ever receives from the pen of the contrivers. My mother too, who had often before hinted to me her wi&s;hes on the &s;ame &s;ubject and to whom my
<PB N="146" REF="149">
Lord had written at the &s;ame time, u&s;ed all her rhetoric to point out the &s;plendid advantages that mu&s;t re&s;ult from this union.</P>
<P>Ah! why, my Lord, cried I inter|rupting him&mdash;why then have you &s;oli|cited my con&s;ent to an application, which if &s;uch are Lord Belmont's views, never can prove &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Mi&s;s Seymour, cried he warmly, how can you form a conclu&s;ion &s;o alarming and &s;o perfectly unju&s;t, merely from a &s;imple explanation which you force me to give you. If you will only li&s;ten to me, you will find the&s;e ap|prehen&s;ions quite imaginary, and wholly void of foundation. Had fate indeed placed you in that &s;ituation, in which till &s;o lately I beheld you doomed to remain, unconnected and unknown, ob|&s;cure in rank, and di&s;tingui&s;hed only by your elegance, your merit, and accom|pli&s;hments; in this ca&s;e, though you
<PB N="143" REF="150">
mu&s;t ever have continued the fir&s;t and deare&s;t object of my affections, yet my friends I allow might have objected; and the certainty that Lord Belmont's approbation was not to be hoped for where no circum&s;tances of birth or for|tune pre&s;ented them&s;elves, has not only tortured my bo&s;om ever &s;ince the mo|ment in which I was favoured with your acquaintance, but has been the origin of all that incon&s;i&s;tency of conduct which mu&s;t have often perplexed and even &s;ometimes perhaps offended you. De|termined at one moment to conquer an attachment that I knew mu&s;t involve me in all the difficulties of di&s;union with my family, I &s;edulou&s;ly avoided you with fortitude and forbearance; con|&s;cious the next of my utter inability to &s;truggle again&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion which in&s;inua|ted it&s;elf into my heart beyond all power of re&s;i&s;tance, I &s;ought with avidity what I had before &s;hunned with apprehen&s;ion,
<PB N="148" REF="151">
and gave my&s;elf wholly up to the de|lightful illu&s;ions of hope and tenderne&s;s. Such being the fluctuating &s;tate of my mind for many months pa&s;t, what was the relief, the exultation I experienced, on the di&s;covery I made at Hubert Hill. The knowledge of your real rank and &s;ituation at once relieved me from all the mi&s;ery of this continual conte&s;t be|tween inclination and principle. My whole &s;oul was in a tumult of joy. Lord Belmont's approbation I con&s;idered as &s;ecured; and from that in&s;tant eagerly watched an opportunity for pouring out at your feet the feelings with which it was overwhelmed. When, there, too, I found the &s;ympathetic &s;oftne&s;s of my Hermione&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh &s;top! for heaven's &s;ake! cried I, interrupting him impatiently. Would to God you had never found the mo|ment you de&s;ired. I fore&s;ee a world of trouble and mi&s;ery from my unpardona|ble
<PB N="149" REF="152">
folly and weakne&s;s. Oh! what on earth could make me &s;o unguarded! Lord Belmont, inflexible in his deter|minations and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, never will be induced to relinqui&s;h his hopes of an alliance on which his views have &s;o long and &s;o invariably re&s;ted, and mu&s;t receive with augmented prejudice and unconquerable repugnance, the grand|child who &s;o unpropitiou&s;ly appears to interrupt his &s;chemes and di&s;appoint his wi&s;hes. Of this, my Lord, you mu&s;t your&s;elf be convinced, even while you labour to per&s;uade me of the contrary.</P>
<P>Shocked at the alarming pro&s;pect which pre&s;ented it&s;elf &s;o forcibly to my appre|hen&s;ion that I could not conceal my fears, my Lord exerted him&s;elf powerfully and &s;ucce&s;sfully to di&s;pel the notion of my grandfather's inflexibility; and I &s;oon began to forget the idea that had given me &s;o much pain.

to &s;uppo&s;e, that his Lord&s;hip, when &s;atisfied as to the propriety and de|corum of our pa&s;t conduct, would re|ceive, otherwi&s;e than with open arms and delighted &s;atisfaction, children who &s;eemed &s;ent as from heaven for the comfort and &s;upport of his old age. That his Lord|&s;hip had hitherto rejected and di&s;owned us, could merely be attributed, he &s;aid, to &s;ome mi&s;taken prejudice which mu&s;t have found its way to his mind even on the Continent. To &s;u&s;pect him now of an ob&s;tinacy &s;o hardened, without any apparent motive except the cruelty and inju&s;tice of his nature, was to accu&s;e him of a &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition extremely oppo|&s;ite to his benevolent temper, and indeed almo&s;t below human nature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I longed extremely to a&s;k him if Lady Linro&s;e was yet acquainted with the de|claration he had made to me; and if &s;o, in what manner &s;he had received it; but the entrance of Lady Aubrey, who however
<PB N="123" REF="154">
did not appear till long after her u&s;ual hour, interrupted all further private con|ver&s;ation between us.</P>
<P>She received his Lord&s;hip with the mo&s;t in&s;inuating kindne&s;s, and with that flattering ea&s;e which &s;o agreeably di&s;|cards the cold ceremony of a fir&s;t inter|view. Immediately after breakfa&s;t, dur|ing which Lady Aubrey entertained her gue&s;t with the polite freedom due to an e&s;teemed and long known friend, his Lord&s;hip told us he was con&s;trained to &s;et off without further delay. I mu&s;t make up for this indulgence, &s;aid he, by travelling with the utmo&s;t expedition; yet with all the celerity I can effect, I think my Lord Belmont will have to wait my arrival at Calais; for as I did not apprehend the di&s;appointment of finding you ab&s;ent, I made no provi&s;ion for the la&s;t day I &s;pent on the road.</P>
<P>He then took leave, recommending, in a low voice, but with a look which
<PB N="152" REF="155">
te&s;tified how &s;anguine were his expecta|tions, the &s;ucce&s;s of this important jour|ney to my be&s;t wi&s;hes; and Lady Au|brey, who overheard him, told him with an expre&s;&s;ive &s;mile that her prayers at|tended his expedition.</P>
<P>After he was gone, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her admiration of him in terms &s;o &s;trong as to gratify me beyond mea&s;ure. His fi|gure, &s;he &s;aid, &s;eemed formed to capti|vate, and the plea&s;ing intelligence of his countenance demon&s;trated that nature had not re&s;ted his merit &s;olely on exter|nal &s;uperiority. She was enchanted with his addre&s;s. From what I have heard of him, &s;aid &s;he, with infinite kindne&s;s, and from what I have &s;een, I am con|vinced that he is not unworthy of my dear child.</P>
<P>I can hardly believe, Sophia, that four and twenty hours have effected &s;uch a re|volution in my mind. My pro&s;pects have undergone &s;o great a change, that I almo&s;t
<PB N="153" REF="156">
imagine I am in a dream. I am indeed in Fairy Land, and all things &s;mile around me. To find my&s;elf the object of Lord Linro&s;e's fonde&s;t partiality, to know that the mo&s;t material ob&s;tacles to our mu|tual happine&s;s never exi&s;ted but in my own apprehen&s;ions, and to perceive a probable ray of hope of &s;oon finding my&s;elf &s;urrounded by friends and rela|tions, di&s;po&s;ed to love, and willing to be beloved by me&mdash;oh! Sophia! what a ble&s;&s;ed rever&s;e from our late friendle&s;s, &s;olitary &s;tate!</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t had a note from Fanny, in|timating that &s;he and Mr. Howard (hav|ing got all his matters adju&s;ted) will be with us on Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>Adieu, my beloved Sophia. I think with delight on the plea&s;ure the peru&s;al of this packet will give to your warm &s;ympathetic heart.</P>

<P>MY &s;i&s;ter and Mr. Howard arrived ye&s;terday. I walked out in hopes of meeting their carriage; but they had taken another road, and had &s;at half an hour with Lady Aubrey before I returned to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This interval &s;he had employed in ex|plaining to them the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs. Mr. Howard was overjoyed, but le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than Lady Aubrey expected; for he had long been con|&s;cious, he told her, that a mutual attach|ment &s;ub&s;ided between Lord Linro&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="158">
and me; and however unaccountable his Lord&s;hip's conduct had &s;ometimes ap|peared, and however well authenticated the report of his marriage had been, he had ever &s;u&s;pected the validity of its foundation, and fore&s;een what in that ca&s;e the i&s;&s;ue would prove.</P>
<P>Fanny was quite intoxicated with joy. She ki&s;&s;ed Lady Aubrey again and again for having communicated &s;uch good news, and when I entered the room, I was obliged to entreat her by a look not in|&s;tantly to bring on the &s;ubject. But my caution was quite unnece&s;&s;ary. She &s;eemed ready to dance from <HI>gaiet&egrave; de caeur</HI>; and at length unable to contain her&s;elf longer &mdash;Mr. Howard, cried &s;he, you mu&s;t &s;a|lute Lady Linro&s;e once more, and wi&s;h her Lady&s;hip joy. It is extremely rude to be &s;o inattentive on the pre&s;ent joyful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It may rather be called unkind per|haps, &s;aid Mr. Howard, (&s;miling, while

he obeyed her commands) but I have long wi&s;hed our dear &s;i&s;ter from the bot|tom of my heart the enjoyment of that happine&s;s which I was convinced would one day prove her fate.</P>
<P>Our Hermione has many rivals, &s;aid Lady Aubrey. Mrs. Howard, I per|ceive, is quite enthu&s;ia&s;tic about my Lord; and as for my&s;elf, though I had his picture faithfully delineated by the mo&s;t able hand before I beheld him, yet I was quite charmed as well with his ap|pearance as with the &s;uperior elegance of his manners and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Our little party la&s;t night was in un|common &s;pirits, and Fanny quite giddy with mirth. We talked over and over every fancied circum&s;tance of the meet|ing which mu&s;t have by this time taken place between the travellers, with an in|tere&s;t that &s;eemed equally to animate the whole party, yet I always feel unea&s;y on repeating before Lady Aubrey the
<PB N="157" REF="162">
name of Lord Belmont, often as it has within the&s;e few days occurred in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation. She &s;poke of him this night her&s;elf however with an apparent tranquillity that partly relieved me; and when I attended her as u&s;ual to her dre&s;&s;ing room after &s;upper, &s;he owned to me, that though the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing him agitated her not a little, &s;he felt for him the tender regard of a daughter, and thought of an interview with a &s;en|&s;ation of mournful &s;atisfaction that &s;oothed and gratified her. He always demon|&s;trated a peculiar fondne&s;s for me, &s;aid &s;he, which excited my warme&s;t gratitude; and though an ill founded re&s;entment on my father's part obliged me during his life time wholly to break off all inter|cour&s;e with the whole family, and after the misfortune of his death I had not courage to think of demanding a vi&s;it from the kind old man before I left Eng|land, my wounds being then too recent
<PB N="158" REF="163">
and my feelings un&s;ubdued by time and patience, yet I always remembered him with tenderne&s;s; and I flatter my&s;elf, after the fir&s;t meeting is over, I &s;hall derive much &s;atisfaction from a re-union which I have always &s;o anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired. To enlarge the objects of our intere&s;t, is in fact to augment the &s;cale of our hap|pine&s;s; and I &s;hall never allow my&s;elf to &s;igh too bitterly for pa&s;t &s;orrows, while the pre&s;ent affords me friends that ex|cite my warme&s;t &s;en&s;ibility.</P>

<P>I have impatiently expected letters from Calais the&s;e two days pa&s;t; Lord Linro&s;e having promi&s;ed to write the moment he had &s;een Lord Belmont; but none have arrived; which I own both di&s;appoints and &s;urpri&s;es me.</P>

<P>No letters &s;till. By this time, if no interruption has retarded their journey, Lord Belmont and his grand&s;on might have been arrived in town in their way to Belmont, which is in &mdash;&s;hire. But I imagine his Lord&s;hip has not travelled with &s;uch expedition as he propo&s;ed; and probably Lord Linro&s;e did not get up with him &s;o &s;oon as was intended. Lord Belmont's health, though much improved by a &s;alutary climate, is but lately re|e&s;tabli&s;hed; and I fear the &s;hock of his &s;on's death may have occa&s;ioned a re|lap&s;e. The weather has been &s;o &s;erene that apprehen&s;ion on the &s;core of their pa&s;&s;age would be ridiculous, yet I can|not avoid being unea&s;y.</P>

<P>Lady Aubrey, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ilence of Lord Linro&s;e fully equalled mine, &s;ent her &s;ervant ye&s;terday evening to wait the arrival of the po&s;t; and while &s;he, Mr. Howard, and my &s;i&s;ter, were &s;at down to <HI>ombre,</HI> my anxiety and impatience led me to &s;teal away to meet the returning me&s;&s;enger. I had &s;trolled towards the great road at the extremity of the park, which is near a mile from the hou&s;e, before I &s;aw him; and having ha&s;tily looked over the letters, perceived with redoubled regret that none were either directed for me or written by the hand of Lord Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed and perplexed, I bade the man go forwards; and returning &s;lowly, was ruminating mo&s;t uncomforta|bly on the unaccountable cau&s;e of this di&s;appointment, when I heard the tramp|ling
<PB N="161" REF="166">
of hor&s;es behind me; and turning round, perceived Lord Linro&s;e on hor&s;e|back, attended by his &s;ervant. I had now got almo&s;t within &s;ight of the hou&s;e. He rode quietly up to me; and in&s;tantly. di&s;mounting, gave his hor&s;e to his &s;er|vant, and approached me with a mixture of plea&s;ure and unea&s;ine&s;s in his counte|nance that in&s;tantly told me &s;omething di&s;agreeable was to follow. He took my hand, and tenderly congratulated me on my improved looks &s;ince he had la&s;t &s;een me. But the &s;olemnity with which he &s;poke alarmed me; and I imagined he had not courage to proceed.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my Lord, &s;aid I at length with a forced &s;mile, things have not turned out happily. Lord Belmont I perceive will not acknowledge his grand|children.</P>
<P>Oh! he is determined and immovable, cried he. He is deaf to my entreaties, and wholly in&s;en&s;ible to the voice of na|ture,
<PB N="162" REF="167">
to compa&s;&s;ion, to humanity, or even to that cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ioned rea&s;on which he recommends to me perpetually as the only &s;afe and rational rule of conduct. I have attempted every human method of prevailing, I have exhau&s;ted every po&s;&s;ible argument of per&s;ua&s;ion, and &s;aid all that man can &s;ay where his la&s;t and deare&s;t hopes of bli&s;s are at &s;take; but oh! he is impenetrable! neither to be &s;oftened into pity nor influenced by ju&s;tice; and he declares him&s;elf delibe|rately re&s;olved on no account whatever either privately to &s;ee or publicly to ac|knowledge his grandchildren. He has even forcibly and ab&s;olutely prote&s;ted &mdash;</P>
<P>That we never more mu&s;t meet, &s;aid I &s;teadily, while he he&s;itated to proceed. Well, my Lord, if &s;uch is his re&s;olution, it is your Lord&s;hip's duty as well as mine implicitly to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Submit! exclaimed he with warmth, throwing him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ionately at my feet.
<PB N="163" REF="168">
No! never, never will I &s;ubmit to a de|ci&s;ion &s;o barbarous, unrea&s;onable, and inhuman. Lord Belmont undoubtedly has a right within certain bounds to pre&s;cribe to me <HI>my</HI> conduct, but <HI>I</HI> on my part po&s;&s;e&s;s one equally potent to expert from his ju&s;tice rea&s;on and moderation. Wherever in tho&s;e points he fails, &s;o far he cancels the mutual bonds of obliga|tion and duty that exi&s;t between us, and &s;ets me free to act for my&s;elf. Had he prohibited a connection which could not have been con&s;idered as di&s;honourable, but merely as mortifying to his views and degrading to his dignity, even in this ca&s;e had my heart been torn to death I &s;carce think I could have gratified my own wi&s;hes at the expence of torturing him with the di&s;appointment of hopes, which however blindly, have invariably &s;ought my happine&s;s as their ultimate founda|tion, and I think, Mi&s;s Seymour, a &s;hort review of my pa&s;t conduct may convince
<PB N="164" REF="169">
you of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion; but when, without the &s;lighte&s;t grounds for di&s;approbation, he objects, when he for|bids an alliance where every gratification of rea&s;on and even of vanity pre&s;ent them&s;elves; when fortune has made you at lea&s;t my equal, and nature created you ah! how infinitely my &s;uperior, the&s;e obligations of duty end; Lord Belmont mu&s;t thank him&s;elf for the &s;tep he obliges us to take; and we are no longer bound to gratify that caprice which rigorou&s;ly demands the &s;acrifice of our whole hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord, cried I &s;orrowfully, all this is mere &s;ophi&s;try. The real &s;tate of the matter is quite different. Lord Bel|mont rejects me as his grandchild either by blood or alliance; and never, never will I be prevailed with to grant an in|dependent con&s;ent, though my grandfa|ther's behaviour towards me may in your Lord&s;hip's opinion &s;ee us free from the&s;e
<PB N="165" REF="170">
obligations of duty which otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t undoubtedly claim: yet &s;urely you cannot be either ignorant of or in&s;en&s;ible to the powerful motives that re&s;train me. How many painful minutes have the di&s;obedience of his children occa&s;ioned to Lord Belmont. Di&s;appointed in his &s;anguine expectations of their happine&s;s, di&s;tracted with the conduct of one &s;on and di&s;plea&s;ed, however unju&s;tly, with the connection formed by the other, he now finds him&s;elf deprived for ever of both, and &s;eeks in his grand&s;on the completion of tho&s;e expectations which have hitherto proved only a &s;ource of vexation, unea&s;ine&s;s, and mortification to his bo&s;om. Oh! my Lord! ought we to render this unfortunate old man &s;till more mi&s;erable? ought we to bla&s;t his la&s;t hopes, and teach him that while he had the genero&s;ity to place his happine&s;s in the pro&s;perity of his children, however blindly he judged of the means, di&s;ap|pointment
<PB N="166" REF="171">
and ingratitude were all the return they afforded him.</P>
<P>Ah! Mi&s;s Seymour! in what a light you place Lord Belmont's conduct! But pray li&s;ten, I entreat you, with equal pa|tience and attention, to a fair and candid examination of the matter from me. Let not a romantic genero&s;ity warp your judgment and bani&s;h your compa&s;&s;ion where it ought more naturally to exert it&s;elf. Great, I allow, would be the weight of your arguments, were Lord Belmont's mi&s;ery the natural con&s;equence of our happine&s;s; but this is &s;o far from being the real ca&s;e, that the mo&s;t cer|tain comfort and mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured &s;atisfaction mu&s;t flow from his being a witne&s;s of our mutual felicity, where no one ob&s;tacle, but tho&s;e of caprice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are alledged. How is it to be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed they will re&s;t on his mind, when all hope of another alliance, which at pre&s;ent &s;upports his inflexibility, is wholly
<PB N="167" REF="172">
and for ever &s;uppre&s;t. No; be a&s;&s;ured my grandfather's eyes will then be open|ed to his error; with the mo&s;t &s;incere re|gret he will abjure his own, and pardon ours, and taking my Hermione to his bo&s;om, will experience in her duty and affection, and in the enjoyment he mu&s;t derive from my un&s;peakable felicity, all the comfort, happine&s;s, and delight, of which, by a fal&s;e genero&s;ity and ill judg|ed adherence to the rigors of duty, you would wholly deprive him in his old days.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord! cried I, &s;oftened at this &s;oothing repre&s;entation, and terrified at my own weakne&s;s, I have li&s;tened too long. I can hear no more. It grows late. I ha&s;tened on; but Lord Linro&s;e per&s;i&s;ted in detaining me, and &s;eizing my hand, implored me for the &s;ake of heaven to think on what he had urged.</P>
<P>No, cried I, I mu&s;t think of it no more. But tell me, what &s;aid Lord Bel|mont?
<PB N="168" REF="173">
of what did he accu&s;e us? what excu&s;e did he offer for this cruel pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>None. When I entered on the &s;ub|ject, I found him thoroughly well inform|ed, and to all appearance even prepared for my application. Linro&s;e, &s;aid he, I know what you are going to propo&s;e: but let me &s;ave you the fatigue of intreaties that are fruitle&s;s, and the pain of hopes that mu&s;t be &s;ucceeded by di&s;appoint|ment. The young women for whom you interceed, be a&s;&s;ured I never will ac|knowledge. I have my own rea&s;ons for this conduct&mdash;rea&s;ons which, accounta|ble to none, &s;hall die in my own brea&s;t. But hear my final determination on this head: if you trifle with my re&s;entment, and dare form a connexion &s;o repugnant to my wi&s;hes, I &s;olemnly declare&mdash; But why &s;hould I repeat to you a denun|ciation evidently the con&s;equence of &s;ome &s;ecret prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, fo&s;tered heaven knows
<PB N="169" REF="174">
how, but which is rooted &s;o deeply in his mind, that &s;ome inhuman, officious hand I am convinced &s;till &s;upports the prejudice it has originally implanted.</P>
<P>What &s;ecret enemy has done us an in|jury &s;o irreparable I have not yet been able to di&s;cover. My Lord would not even hear me on the &s;ubject; and when I &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted, that as your only &s;ur|viving parent he was bound in honour to afford you his countenance and protec|tion, or to &s;atisfy you and the world why both were withheld, he told me with an indignant &s;mile that his motives would exculpate his conduct both to the world and to his own heart. I perceived, I re|plied, that he laboured under the inju|rious mi&s;take which had for &s;ome time, owing to a variety of circum&s;tances that a few moments could explain, prevailed to your di&s;advantage, and in&s;tantly en|tered on the &s;everal points that had &s;o unfortunately led to this idea.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175">He li&s;tened in contemptuous &s;ilence. I am perfectly &s;atisfied, &s;aid he ironically, as to the conduct of the young ladies. I accu&s;e them of nothing: but I ab&s;olutely de&s;ire that I may hear nothing further on a &s;ubject that fatigues me, and which entirely embitters the enjoyment I had vainly flattered my&s;elf this meeting would have given me.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation took place during the evening on which we met at Calais; and next day, while we travelled from Dover to town, I renewed the &s;ubject, and endeavoured to work on his Lord|&s;hip's feelings, finding all attempts to convince his rea&s;on un&s;ucce&s;sful. An accident however occurred, which all the malice of ill fortune could not have introduced at a more unlucky moment. We encountered Lord Mortonbury at the &s;tage where we dined, and he ea&s;ily per&s;uaded my Lord to &s;pend a few days at his country &s;eat, which lies in our way
<PB N="171" REF="176">
to Belmont. A rencontre &s;o ill fated could &s;carce have happened. The &s;ight of his old friend could not fail to &s;trength|en and augment his Lord&s;hip's obduracy, and confirm his determination in favour of an alliance that has &s;o long been his favourite wi&s;h. For &s;ome time therefore I carefully avoided exciting his re&s;ent|ment by touching on a topic, which I perceived, from &s;ome di&s;agreeable hints he occa&s;ionally let fall, would now be li&s;tened to with le&s;s temper than ever.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, to write to you was im|po&s;&s;ible. I could tell you nothing but what I wi&s;hed eternally to forget, and I could only have made you a &s;harer in the unea&s;ine&s;s that weighed down my own &s;pirits. Teazed and worn out, I could no longer &s;upport with patience the mi|&s;erable uncertainty of my &s;ituation, and at length ventured to ri&s;k a renewal of this topic of contention. I began by im|prudently a&s;&s;uring his Lord&s;hip that my
<PB N="172" REF="177">
re&s;olutions in regard to Lady Elizabeth were fixed and unalterable. My ill judged warmth provoked and exa&s;perated him; and I found, that in&s;tead of gaining ground, my arguments were received with augmented di&s;plea&s;ure, and if po&s;&s;i|ble with more determined repugnance than before.</P>
<P>Convinced that all hopes of prevailing were at an end, I then determined to contrive an e&s;cape for one day, which the pretext of vi&s;iting a friend, who re|&s;ides in this county ea&s;ily afforded me; and to endeavour if po&s;&s;ible to reconcile you to a &s;tep, which, however alarming on the fir&s;t view, be a&s;&s;ured, lovelie&s;t Hermione, pre&s;ents no real danger. You determine before you have fairly weighed and con&s;idered the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. You are &s;cared with the notion of di&s;obedience, ere you reflect that from you Lord Belmont claims no duty; and the idea of a private marriage &s;hocks you
<PB N="173" REF="178">
as an indelicacy and terrafies you as dar|ing, merely becau&s;e you have been ac|cu&s;tomed to regard it in that light, with|out reflecting on the &s;ingularity of your &s;ituation, and the &s;atisfaction which mu&s;t re&s;ult even to Lord Belmont from this temporary di&s;appointment, We leave Morton Hall to-morrow evening; at which place I mu&s;t by that time be, in order to accompany my grandfather to Belmont, where he has &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle previous to a vi&s;it he means to pay my mother in Northampton&s;hire. But oh! Mi&s;s Seymour, with what alacrity, with what delight &s;hall I return to him, if you will but rai&s;e me from this &s;tate of de&s;pair, if you will but animate me to life and hope, and generou&s;ly promi&s;e to be mine, without an approbation that is not to be obtained.</P>
<P>We had now reached the hou&s;e, and it began to be very late. Stay but for an in&s;tant, cried he, and relieve me from this agony of uncertainty.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="179">No, no, cried I, pulling away my hand, I mu&s;t li&s;ten no longer, I mu&s;t hear no more; and entering the hall, I ran up to my own apartment in &s;pite of all his efforts to detain me.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia! I carried thither all the in&s;inuating arguments to which I had been attending with &s;o much irre&s;olu|tion; and I found, that while my judg|ment remained unconvinced, and my de|licacy revolted at the idea of a clande&s;|tine connexion, &s;o contrary to that open dignity of conduct which I had flattered my&s;elf with the hope of &s;upporting inva|riably thro' life, my heart died within me at the cruel &s;acrifice I made to prin|ciple. Even &s;elf applau&s;e &s;u&s;tained not my &s;pirits. Pride was &s;ubdued by &s;oft|ne&s;s; and I found that one moment lon|ger would have given to Lord Linro&s;e all he wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Involved in this mi&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, I yet began at length to perceive how provi|dential

was that e&s;cape which at fir&s;t I had almo&s;t regretted; and I con&s;idered, with a thankfulne&s;s that half bordered on &s;a|tisfaction, what mortification mu&s;t have ever attended the recollection of a &s;tep which I could not but have con&s;idered as derogatory to the character I have ever wi&s;hed and endeavoured to maintain.</P>
<P>This idea &s;omewhat con&s;oled me; and re&s;olving to &s;truggle with feelings which I could not in private indulge without in a great mea&s;ure betraying them to Lord Linro&s;e, and rendering them obvious to the re&s;t of the family, I forced my&s;elf in|to &s;eeming compo&s;ure, and went down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey and my &s;i&s;ter were toge|ther. Mr. Howard, I found, had been &s;ent for to another room to Lord Linro&s;e, of who&s;e arrival they were yet ignorant. I had the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k therefore of di&s;clo&s;ing to them the &s;cene that had ju&s;t taken place. Poor Fanny's chagrin kept
<PB N="176" REF="181">
pace with her late exultation, and Lady Aubrey's countenance was clouded with the mo&s;t friendly di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Who can be &s;uch a fiend, cried Fan|ny, as to per&s;ecute us in this cruel man|ner without the &s;lighte&s;t provocation? who upon the face of the earth can find either intere&s;t or plea&s;ure in bla&s;ting our reputations, and per&s;uading Lord Bel|mont that we are unworthy of his re|gard? and who could po&s;&s;ibly have dreamt that he would have proved thus ob&s;tinate and determined, when all the re&s;t of the family are now our friends; when even Lady Linro&s;e her&s;elf profe&s;&s;es to love us, and wi&s;hes to &s;ee us rein&s;tated in his favour.</P>
<P>So her Lady&s;hip is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, cried I; but from what Lord Linro&s;e let fall this evening, I think there is great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that her wi&s;hes have a very contrary direction. From her repre&s;en|tation only can Lord Belmont have im|bibed
<PB N="177" REF="182">
the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that retain &s;uch fa&s;t hold on his mind, &s;ince from no other per&s;on could he po&s;&s;ibly have re|ceived intelligence concerning us.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;orry, &s;aid Lady Aubrey, to accu&s;e Lady Linro&s;e, or to &s;u&s;pect her of a conduct below her character; but I own I have had my doubts of her on this occa&s;ion from the beginning. Her mo|tives, tho' mean and de&s;picable, are &s;uf|ficiently obvious, and I have been told by my aunt, Lady Meredith, that &s;he is a woman of a very unamiable character, and generally di&s;liked.</P>
<P>The entrance of Lord Linro&s;e and Mr. Howard prevented her proceeding. The former was vi&s;ibly depre&s;&s;ed; and ap|peared to exert him&s;elf to conver&s;e upon the indifferent topics which en&s;ued, but which were very languidly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the company during the whole evening.</P>
<P>Supper was &s;oon after announced; and being &s;eated by him at table, he intreated
<PB N="178" REF="183">
me in a low voice to give him an oppor|tunity for one half hour's conver&s;ation before he left us, which mu&s;t be early in the morning.</P>
<P>I told him &s;teadily that he mu&s;t not expect me to li&s;ten to a repetition of ar|guments, which without Lord Belmont's &s;anction could lead to nothing, If any favourable moment occurs, &s;aid I, in which you can flatter your&s;elf with the hope of &s;etting your plans in &s;uch a point of view as will obtain my Lords appro|bation, I believe your Lord&s;hip hardly doubts of mine. But why &s;hould you even wi&s;h to &s;often me into a compliance which, wanting the concurrence of my rea&s;on, and wholly oppo&s;ite to my ideas of propriety, would but lower me in my own e&s;timation, and render me too un|happy to enable me to&mdash;</P>
<P>I was afraid of my voice, and ventured not to proceed. Lord Linro&s;e pre&s;t my hand unob&s;erved, and whi&s;pered a thou|&s;and
<PB N="179" REF="184">
expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and acqui|e&s;cence. At lea&s;t, &s;aid he, I promi&s;e to acquie&s;ce till every po&s;&s;ible &s;ource of tri|al has been attempted in vain. In the mean time, you cannot &s;urely have the barbarity to refu&s;e allowing me to corre|&s;pond with you. To this reque&s;t I can take no denial.</P>
<P>I agreed for the pre&s;ent to the propo|&s;al becau&s;e I could not prevail with my|&s;elf to refu&s;e <HI>all</HI> he a&s;ked; but I am much afraid even this is an indulgence that mu&s;t &s;oon be relinqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>When we &s;eparated for the night, La|dy Aubrey remained &s;ome time behind in conver&s;ation with my Lord and Mr. Howard. His Lord&s;hip u&s;ed every ar|gument to prevail with them to approve of an immediate marriage; and men|tioned the fortune he inherited from Sir Thomas Roat&s;ley, which &s;ecured him a competency; all, he was certain, for which I would be &s;olicitous till a recon|ciliation
<PB N="180" REF="185">
with Lord Belmont took place. But Lady Aubrey told him, that tho', had &s;uch been the re&s;ult of my delibera|tions, &s;he &s;hould not have oppo&s;ed a mea|&s;ure which undoubtedly, from the pecu|liarity of our &s;ituation, afforded &s;ome ex|cu&s;e, yet &s;he would not advi&s;e what &s;he could not approve, and on the contrary mu&s;t ever admire the &s;teadine&s;s of my re|&s;olution, which having it's foundation in delicacy and principle, whatever was the angui&s;h it occa&s;ioned me, &s;he was con|vinced I would &s;trictly adhere to.</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Madam! cried I, pe|netrated with &s;hame while &s;he repeated to me this part of their conver&s;ation, &s;tea|dily will I adhere to this re&s;olution, &s;ince it is &s;anctioned with your applau&s;e. But much angui&s;h has it occa&s;ioned to my heart, and much I fear your opinion of my heroi&s;m would be infinitely dimini&s;h|ed, did you know how near I was incur|ring your contempt by yielding to my Lord's wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="186">My contempt, my deare&s;t Hermione? Be a&s;&s;ured that is a &s;entiment my heart never can feel for you.

<P>I received this day the following letter from Lord Linro&s;e.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>How &s;hall I &s;ummon re&s;olution to ac|knowledge to the lovelie&s;t of women,
<PB N="182" REF="187">
that my &s;ole hope of becoming the hap|pie&s;t and mo&s;t envied of men, re&s;ts on a plan, the mention of which I tremble to remember &s;hocked and &s;tartled her &s;o &s;everely. Lord Belmont, I am unwil|lingly con&s;trained to own, is more de|termined, more infatuated if po&s;&s;ible than ever; and without dwelling on ungrate|ful particulars, I am forced to tell you, that of any alteration in his pre&s;ent &s;en|timents I dare no longer entertain the &s;lighte&s;t hope.</P>
<P>But is it the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of Lord Belmont's inflexibility, that I mu&s;t be doomed to unmitigated mi&s;ery, and you be rendered unhappy? And why ought we to prove a &s;acrifice to caprice, where not one rea&s;onable ob&s;tacle ob|&s;tructs our union? no duty &s;urely is ow|ing to that parent who denies the title and di&s;owns all claim to obedience. Yet if you will per&s;i&s;t in regurding him in that &s;acred light, give him, I intreat, the

mo&s;t lively proof of your affection: oblige him in his own de&s;pite. Make me the happie&s;t of mankind; and gratify the fir&s;t wi&s;h of the old man's heart, by al|lowing him to witne&s;s the, un&s;peakable felicity which, you and you only can confer upon his grand&s;on.</P>
<P>In regard to fortune, I am convinced you are by no means apprehen&s;ive. Mine, independent of my grandfather, were Hermione to &s;hare it with me, would &s;urpa&s;s my own wi&s;hes, and I am convinced &s;atisfy hers. The motive of her re&s;i&s;tance, I am certain, is too ge|nerous to allow for a moment, of &s;uch con&s;iderations. She trembles to wound a heart that has &s;o long and &s;o &s;everely bled; but be a&s;&s;ured you will heal in&s;tead of augment his &s;orrows&mdash;you will &s;ooth in&s;tead of torture his bo&s;om, you will con&s;ole him for all he has &s;uffered, and a momentary di&s;appointment will be &s;ucceeded by uncea&s;ing con&s;olation.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="189">I have more than once &s;ounded my Lord as to the &s;ecret author of this pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome intermeddling &s;landerous tongue, never could have found its way into his mind; but on this &s;ubject his caution baffles all my penetration. I even be|gan mo&s;t unju&s;tly to accu&s;e my mother, as the only per&s;on on whom I could contrive to re&s;t my &s;u&s;picions with any &s;hadow of probability; but I now hear|tily repent the injurious idea which in|duced me to write her upon the &s;ubject with much acrimony, for my heart was too much tortured either to expre&s;s my|&s;elf with calmne&s;s or to think with rea&s;on.

</LETTER>
<P>The peru&s;al of this letter has indeed plunged me into a &s;ea of troubles; and on the fir&s;t reading, I thought only of acceding to Lord Linro&s;e's propo&s;al. I con&s;idered nothing but the &s;ad alterna|tive, either of hazarding every incon|venience and yielding at once to his en|treaties, or of relinqui&s;hing him for ever. I forgot the repugnance of my own heart to a mea&s;ure &s;o bold and &s;o dangerous, and which recurred with painful force
<PB N="186" REF="191">
the in&s;tant the perturbation of my mind began to abate. I remembered not the applau&s;e which had in my cool moments attended my former refu&s;al, nor the con&s;olation which I had derived from that of my dear and ever re&s;pected Lady Aubrey, who&s;e approbation of my con|duct is e&s;&s;ential to my peace. I con&s;i|dered not the peculiar &s;ituation of Lord Linro&s;e; who&s;e rank in the world, and habits of living mu&s;t, with the be&s;t di&s;|po&s;ition in the world, render him parti|cularly unfit for the circum&s;cribed oeco|nomy and &s;eclu&s;ion of which his own in|dependent fortune would admit. Mr. Howard tells me it does not exceed five or &s;ix hundred a year; and to this limit|ed income, which I make no doubt has hardly hitherto &s;erved for the little inci|dental charges of pocket money, Lord Linro&s;e would be forced to &s;ubmit pro|bably during the life time of Lord Bel|mont, for as to the hopes of &s;oftening
<PB N="187" REF="192">
him into forgivene&s;s, even Lady Au|brey, it is ea&s;y to perceive, builds little on that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Stern and unrelenting when once tho|roughly exa&s;perated, it is infinitely more probable, &s;he &s;ays, that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and time may &s;often him in our favour than that he &s;hould ever be prevailed with to pardon an act of open defiance. The very idea that Lord Linro&s;e, from now con&s;idering him&s;elf as the &s;ole and na|tural heir of his title and wealth, may with le&s;s apprehen&s;ion dare to brave his di&s;plea&s;ure, is a circum&s;tance the mo&s;t likely to induce him to let his grand&s;on feel the whole weight of his indignation in every way he can devi&s;e, and as long as he lives to puni&s;h his di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Some of the mo&s;t prudent of the&s;e con&s;iderations you will &s;u&s;pect, Sophia, were not wholly the &s;ugge&s;tions of my own mind. At lea&s;t at fir&s;t, though my rea&s;on could not but entirely acquie&s;ce
<PB N="188" REF="193">
with the force, ju&s;tice, and probability of all tho&s;e conclu&s;ions, the moment they either occurred to my&s;elf or were &s;ugge&s;ted to me by the apprehen&s;ive tenderne&s;s of my dear Lady Aubrey, that difficulty which had impre&s;&s;ed me with the lea&s;t alarm became, from her prudent repre&s;enta|tion, the motive that weighed the mo&s;t forcibly again&s;t my compliance. The idea of involving Lord Linro&s;e perhaps for a period of years, (for Lord Bel|mont, though advanced in life, may &s;urvive a long time) in all the inconve|niences of a narrow fortune, for which he mu&s;t be &s;o peculiarly ill calculated, is a mea&s;ure I find I could not &s;ummon re|&s;olution to hazard.</P>
<P>I have therefore written to him. I have de&s;ired him to think of me no more till his propo&s;als are authorized by Lord Belmont's con&s;ent. But I believe I have not been able to conceal the poignant regret with which I make the
<PB N="189" REF="194">
&s;acrifice; and indeed if it will &s;erve to &s;often his di&s;appointment, I wi&s;h not to deny how deeply I partake in the &s;uffer|ings I am con&s;trained to inflict.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>AUGUST 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>With what infinite tenderne&s;s and &s;ym|pathy Lady Aubrey enters into all my feelings on this occa&s;ion. She &s;ooths my unea&s;ine&s;s, with a pity that draws my confidence and claims my warme&s;t gra|titude. I no longer conceal from her the regret I experience in giving pain to Lord Linro&s;e, and di&s;appointing his hopes. I even confe&s;s it to her with an ea&s;e that lulls my di&s;tre&s;s and fortifies my mind.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter's gaiety has quite de&s;erted her, &s;ince this &s;ad rever&s;e took place. Mr. Howard too mu&s;t naturally expe|rience &s;ome per&s;onal di&s;appointment.
<PB N="190" REF="195">
The advantages re&s;ulting from a recon|ciliation with Lord Belmont are of no trifling importance to the intere&s;ts of an encrea&s;ing family. But I doubt if Fanny carries her ideas &s;o far. Her mortifica|tion is merely excited by her feelings for mine and that regret which it is natural to &s;uffer on being forced finally to relin|qui&s;h a favourite pro&s;pect that has been long and fondly cheri&s;hed.</P>

<P>I exert my&s;elf to appear chearful tho' the means by which I &s;upport my &s;eem|ing heroi&s;m but prepares me perhaps for fre&s;h unea&s;ine&s;s. I cannot help &s;ecretly flattering my&s;elf that if an interview were by any means to take place between Lady Aubrey and Lord Belmont, &s;he might with &s;ome probability of &s;ucce&s;s undertake our defence, and extirpate
<PB N="191" REF="196">
tho&s;e deep-rooted prejudices that have been productive of con&s;equences &s;o un|happy. Such a propo&s;al, however, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ugge&s;t; particu|larly as &s;he now never mentions any in|tention of &s;oliciting a renewal of Lord Belmont's acquaintance, and &s;eems to have merely regarded that mea&s;ure as the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the connection between them which my marriage mu&s;t have produced. This I own &s;urpri&s;es me; but I &s;uppo&s;e her courage having failed her as the moment &s;eemed ap|proaching, &s;he hardly regrets a &s;atisfac|tion which mu&s;t have been purcha&s;ed at the price of &s;o much agitation and ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>I think continually in what manner and with what &s;en&s;ations Lord Linro&s;e has received my letter. I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall have his an&s;wer to-morrow or next day. I &s;incerely hope he will re&s;ign him&s;elf to my determination without any further
<PB N="192" REF="197">
&s;olicitations. I tremble le&s;t he &s;hould take the re&s;olution of coming again hi|ther.</P>
<P>This evening's po&s;t brought me my dear, dear Sophia's delightful packet, which has given me more plea&s;ure than I thought it po&s;&s;ible I could have ta&s;ted in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my &s;pirits. Oh what infinite comfort does the hopes, however di&s;tant, of one day embracing you infu&s;e into my heart. I think I ought not to complain of any calamity when heaven promi&s;es me a con&s;olation &s;o powerful towards &s;oothing every painful regret. This idea not only heals my unea&s;ine&s;s, but in&s;pires me with re&s;olution to &s;trug|gle again&s;t it. I am infinitely more re|&s;igned &s;ince your letter arrived. Two others accompanied it, which I &s;hould hardly have thought of mentioning did not one of them contain a piece of in|telligence at which I cannot but feel &s;in|cere plea&s;ure: it is from Mi&s;s Par&s;ons,
<PB N="193" REF="198">
who informs me that &s;he is in a few weeks to give her hand to a gentleman who has lately paid her his addre&s;&s;es: he is a clergyman, a middle aged man, &s;he tells me, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an excellent character, and a good living. My &s;i&s;ter and I are much plea&s;ed to find that a &s;et|tlement &s;o fortunate and &s;o comfortable at la&s;t puts a final period to poor Mi&s;s Jenny's mortifications and difficulties; for by &s;ome hints in her letter I &s;u&s;pect that her &s;ituation in Lady Linro&s;e's fa|mily was by no means &s;o comfortable as &s;he at fir&s;t expected.

<P>My &s;i&s;ter having been ye&s;terday a little indi&s;po&s;ed. Lady Aubrey propo&s;ed taking her for an airing this morning immediately after breakfa&s;t, and en|treated me to accompany them; but I excu&s;ed my&s;elf on pretence of fini&s;hing a packet to my Sophia, which really was my intention. My &s;pirits however were particularly languid, and being left to my own meditations, I found my&s;elf un|fit for writing. I &s;eated my&s;elf there|fore on the window &s;eat, li&s;tle&s;s and in|active, and was revolving in my mind, among other &s;ubjects of unea&s;ine&s;s, the implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;ilence with which Lord Linro&s;e had received my letter, when this reverie was &s;uddenly inter|rupted by the appearance of a chariot and four, which drove full &s;peed up the

avenue; and while I was thinking with regret who this unwelcome vi&s;itor could be, the door of the parlour opened and a &s;ervant announced Lord Linro&s;e.</P>
<P>My own perturbation, un&s;peakable as it was, did not conceal from me the agi|tation that &s;truggled in his countenance; but my apprehen&s;ion and a&s;toni&s;hment on &s;o unexpectedly beholding him, pre|vented me from di&s;covering whether it was grief or plea&s;ure that occa&s;ioned the hurry and emotion vi&s;ible in every fea|ture.

<P>The moment my &s;en&s;es were re&s;tored, he poured upon me &s;o many grateful ac|knowledgments for this proof of my &s;en&s;ibility, and accu&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o bitterly of imprudence in having &s;o &s;uddenly in|formed me of this &s;urpri&s;ing event, that I blu&s;hed for the weakne&s;s I had be|trayed, and be&s;ought him to talk of it no more, but to inform me to what we owed this change in Lord Belmont's &s;entiments.</P>

think only of what we owe to heaven and Lady Aubrey.</P>
<P>To this conciliating reque&s;t, &s;aid my Lord, I certainly &s;hould not he&s;itate to promi&s;e implicit obedience; but I will not a&s;&s;ume merit with you on account of a compliance which Lord Belmont, dreading the con&s;equences of indignation &s;o ju&s;tly excited, has already exacted. The anxiety with which he laid his com|mands on me never to make this tran&s;|action a foundation either for inve&s;tiga|tion or retaliation convinced me at once &mdash;that I mu&s;t indeed enquire no far|ther&mdash;though never will it be in my power in future to honour or e&s;teem&mdash;</P>
<P>Hold for heaven's &s;ake! cried I, frightened at the vehemence with which he &s;poke, you already infringe your pro|mi&s;e. Oh! think not of di&s;plea&s;ure; but tell me what means Lady Aubrey employed to produce this wonderful change.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="208">My Lord then put into my hands an open letter, which he took from his let|ter ca&s;e. Here, cried he, is the invalu|able performance, that has wrought with the force of magic, and not only poured conviction on Lord Belmont's mind, for that indeed is a point which time mu&s;t naturally have of cour&s;e effected, but with miraculous power has at once re|moved all tho&s;e barriers of prejudice and repugnance that have ob&s;tructed my hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly began to peru&s;e it; but the fir&s;t lines affected me &s;o violently, that I was unable ta proceed; and my Lord in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould give over the attempt till I was le&s;s agitated. I would then have made my e&s;cape in order to recover &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure; but he would not &s;uffer me to withdraw, and detained me by relating the effect this pathetic let|ter had produced on Lord Belmont.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="209">Lord Linro&s;e &s;aid he was not pre|&s;ent when the letter was pre&s;ented to Lord Belmont; but having been an air|ing on hor&s;eback, a &s;ervant who watched his return informed him that my Lord de&s;ired to &s;ee him in his apartment.</P>
<P>On entering the chamber, he found his Lord&s;hip alone and much agitated. His features, on attempting to &s;peak, &s;eemed almo&s;t convul&s;ed, from the effort of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing his tears, which at length forced their way down his cheek. Lord Lin|ro&s;e ha&s;tily enquired the cau&s;e of his emotion, but for &s;ome moments he was unable to explain it. Linro&s;e, &s;aid he at la&s;t, be not alarmed. Read that letter. It was &s;ufficiently explanatory, and hard|ly was it fini&s;hed when Lord Linro&s;e found him&s;elf in his grandfather's arms. I blame my&s;elf &s;everely, &s;aid he; but I have been deceived and mi&s;led in a mo&s;t ungenerous manner, I ought not howe|ver

<P>I know, cried Lord Linro&s;e, ha&s;tily firing at a &s;u&s;picion which he had &s;o often di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with much &s;elf accu&s;ation, it is my mother who has been &s;ecretly at the bottom of this affair; and I &s;olemnly &s;wear&mdash;</P>
<P>He was proceeding, he owns, in a &s;train equally violent and improper, when Lord Belmont &s;uddenly &s;topt him; and without ab&s;olutely either affirming or denying the ju&s;tice of the charge, told him that if he would not in&s;tantly give him his promi&s;e in the mo&s;t &s;acred man|ner never to attempt by any means to &s;earch into the grounds of his behaviour, and whatever were his own private &s;u&s;|picions never to dare to re&s;ent it, his eter|nal di&s;plea&s;ure &s;hould be the inevitable

<P>Intoxicated with joy, I in&s;tantly bound my&s;elf by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vow, &s;aid Lord Linro&s;e, con&s;cientiou&s;ly to adhere to this command. Lord Belmont had indeed taken a method &s;o effectual for &s;ubduing my di&s;plea&s;ure, that three words from his lips had wholly bani&s;hed it from my memory, and threw me into an exta|cy of &s;pirits that made me in charity with all mankind.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey, &s;aid Lord Belmont, a|gain melting at the recollections that crouded on his mind, the amiable Lady Aubrey could make me no reque&s;t with which I &s;hould not think my&s;elf bound to comply; and I con&s;ider it as a &s;ingu|lar felicity that I po&s;&s;e&s;s the ability of gratifying the wi&s;hes of the mo&s;t bene|volent of female hearts, which, thro' my
<PB N="205" REF="212">
family was in the early pride of youth and beauty torn with di&s;traction and lo&s;t to the world. I loved and admired her with the tender partiality of a parent; and the circum&s;tance of her having afforded my granddaughters that friend&s;hip and pro|tection which were denied them from a more natural quarter, convinces me they mu&s;t be de&s;erving of the warm in|tere&s;t &s;he feels for them, and elevates her higher than ever in my e&s;timation and regard.</P>
<P>Finding we were at Aubrey Ca&s;tle, Lord Belmont willingly con&s;ented to al|low Lord Linro&s;e to &s;et off early this morning, after a &s;hort apology to Lord Mortonbury, which was afterwards to be followed by a fuller explanation; and having written an an&s;wer to Lady Au|brey's letter, to be pre&s;ented by his grand&s;on, promi&s;ed to join him at this place on Wedne&s;day next.</P>
<P>Lord Linro&s;e having fini&s;hed his rela|tion,
<PB N="206" REF="213">
at length permitted me to retire for a few moments to read the propitious let|ter which had effected &s;uch miracles, and gave me Lord Belmont's an&s;wer to pre|&s;ent to Lady Aubrey on her return from her airing. Here is a faithful copy of the former.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF BELMONT.</HEAD>
<P>After a tedious &s;pace of &s;ixteen mourn|ful years, will Lord Belmont allow a long forgotten friend to enquire, if time has wholly era&s;ed from his remembrance her whom once he honoured with the name of <HI>daughter</HI>; who once valued her|&s;elf on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a di&s;tingui&s;hed place in his e&s;teem and in his affections, and who has cheri&s;hed towards him, amid&s;t the pangs of mi&s;ery and the languor of a di&s;|tant and melancholy &s;olitude, that tender duty and filial regard, which, connected with a thou&s;and agonizing recollections, never can be effaced from her heart. Yes, my Lord, after a di&s;mal lap&s;e of time,
<PB N="207" REF="214">
memory recalls your kindne&s;s, your pa|ternal care&s;&s;es, with a gratitude and cha&s;|tened plea&s;ure &s;carce inferior to that which they excited when I was indeed your child; and one of the mo&s;t fervent wi&s;hes of my heart is, to be allowed to think I have a father, and gratified with the permi&s;&s;ion of a&s;king on my knees his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>That heart, my Lord, which, worn out with &s;uffering and &s;ubdued by &s;orrow, looked around the univer&s;e and beheld no &s;ingle remaining &s;ource of hope and con&s;olation, has lately di&s;covered, by the mercy of a gracious providence, one lit|tle &s;pot of re&s;t, one prop of &s;upport, that tells me I have not been bereft of all; and which bids me be grateful and re|&s;igned. The Almighty has vouch&s;afed me a tender bond of union, that binds me to life and connects me with mankind; He has granted me the tender intere&s;t of parental fondne&s;s, which with divine in|fluence
<PB N="208" REF="215">
heals the corroding remembrance of his le&s;s gracious di&s;pen&s;ations, and pre|&s;ents me with a ray of &s;atisfaction even in this world. Heaven has &s;ent me two lovely and beloved daughters, dear to my &s;oul and unrivalled in my admiration, and who claim the enthu&s;ia&s;tic adoration of a parent's heart: yet by <HI>him</HI> alone, who enjoys a right to that &s;acred title, they are abandoned and di&s;owned; to him the &s;ame healing benefit is offered; but he di&s;dains its acceptance, he rejects the &s;oothing comfort, and will not lay hold of tho&s;e alleviations which a pitying Providence be&s;tows.</P>
<P>What hidden and my&s;terious cau&s;e! what unaccountable and unmerited pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, have bani&s;hed the warm be|nevolence and mi&s;led the rectitude that formed the ruling principles of Lord Bel|mont's character? Ah! my Lord! whatever &s;ecret and malevolent enemy has poi&s;oned your mind with doubts and pre|judices,
<PB N="209" REF="216">
be a&s;&s;ured they have not the &s;lighte&s;t foundation in truth. Some &s;elf|i&s;h and ungenerous motive mu&s;t have prompted the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations. Give not credit to &s;o ba&s;e a lie. Con&s;ent but to behold your innocent, your amiable grandchildren, and every &s;u&s;picion will be refuted, all mediation u&s;ele&s;s, and per|&s;ua&s;ion at an end. Subdued and en|chanted, you will take them to your pa|ternal bo&s;om, you will de&s;ire to attach them to you by &s;till clo&s;er ties, by the &s;pontaneous bonds of gratitude and ob|ligation. You will love them with the fondne&s;s of a father: you will love them perhaps <HI>as I love them</HI>: and their unre|mitting and affectionate duty will give additional intere&s;t to your exi&s;tence, as it con&s;titutes the &s;ole ble&s;&s;ing of mine.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t of the&s;e valuable young women, has already di&s;po&s;ed of her hand to a gentleman of &s;ingular worth, but who&s;e fortune equals not his merit. The
<PB N="210" REF="217">
elde&s;t, who&s;e charms are of the mo&s;t in&s;i|nuating nature, beautiful and enchanting as an angel, unites with the mo&s;t acute &s;en&s;ibility that di&s;intere&s;ted genero&s;ity and high &s;en&s;e of honor, in which genu|ine virtue con&s;i&s;ts. Adoring and adored by her cou&s;in Lord Linro&s;e, &s;he heroical|ly prefers the tranquillity of the parent who rejects her, and who&s;e mi&s;guided prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;he mu&s;t ever deplore, to the certain happine&s;s it was in her option to have enjoyed; and what, alas! requir|ed tenfold fortitude&mdash;which it was in her power to have conferred.</P>
<P>Will you, my Lord, allow a &s;acrifice like this to remain unrewarded? Will you permit two amiable young people to continue di&s;appointed and unhappy, who but for a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of filial piety would have been ble&s;&s;ed in each other? Ah! no! your Lord&s;hip requires but the film that blinded you to be taken from your eyes, and I feel that I have already pre|vailed.
<PB N="211" REF="218">
You will no longer deny your|&s;elf the delight of participating in the fe|licity you are enabled to be&s;tow, and your generous mind will experience &s;atisfac|tion in affording a lively &s;en&s;ation of plea|&s;ure, to her who&s;e heart has &s;o long bled for and now deeply partakes in the &s;uffer|ings of her young friends, but who &s;hall ever remain, with implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and the warme&s;t regard,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I was not recovered from the emotion into which the peru&s;al of this affecting letter had thrown me, when I heard Lady Aubrey's foot on the &s;tairs, followed by my &s;i&s;ter. Eager to inform them of what had taken place &s;ince the morning, I flew to the door ju&s;t as they were pa&s;&s;ing in order to enter the adjoining drawing room; and incapable at that moment
<PB N="212" REF="219">
either of calmly explaining the cau&s;e of my perturbation or of conquering its vi|olence, I threw my&s;elf into the arms of the dear friend to whom I owed &s;o much, and &s;obbed upon her neck without being able to utter one word.</P>
<P>Fanny was terrified, and Lady Aubrey for an in&s;tant a&s;toni&s;hed and alarmed: but her own letter, which I held open in my hand, and the knowledge, of Lord Lin|ro&s;e's arrival, which &s;he had learnt be|low, &s;oon relieved her fears and told her what I was unable to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Belmont has then yielded, my love, has he not? cried &s;he, warmly re|turning my embraces. Oh! I hoped much from the generous benevolence of that worthy man's di&s;po&s;ition. It was the apprehen&s;ion of retaining you in a pain|ful &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, which I could not be <HI>certain</HI> would not have been &s;ucceed|ed by di&s;appointment, prevented me from acquainting you with this la&s;t and fortu|nate
<PB N="213" REF="220">
attempt to &s;often him in your fa|vour till I was informed of it's &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Fanny was in extacies, and wept and laughed by turns; but &s;oon growing more compo&s;ed, I delivered to Lady Aubrey the letter from Lord Belmont.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed much affected even with the &s;ight of the writing. Her hand &s;hook violently on receiving it from me, and &s;he in&s;tantly retired with it into her own chamber. Fanny then left me, to con|gratulate Lord Linro&s;e, whom &s;he was impatient to &s;ee; but I found it impo&s;&s;i|ble to ta&s;te &s;atisfaction while my ever dear Lady Aubrey's generous participa|tion in my happine&s;s was damped with &s;o much pain, and mingled with &s;o many contending feelings. I ventured not for &s;ome time to intrude on her retirement; but at length apprehen&s;ion carried me to the door of her apartment, where I over|heard her weeping with &s;o much angui&s;h that I took courage to make an attempt
<PB N="214" REF="221">
to enter. It was fa&s;tened on the in&s;ide however, and I withdrew in re&s;pectful &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Short was this indulgence of &s;orrow. In half an hour &s;he joined me wiih a pla|cid and compo&s;ed countenance, and hav|ing once more embraced and congratu|lated me, gave me Lord Belmont's letter to peru&s;e, and went to welcome Lord Linro&s;e.</P>

The letter you have honoured me with has but augmented the enthu&s;i|a&s;tic regard with which every tender re|collection of Lady Aubrey has ever been

accompanied; and the humane and be|nevolent application it contains, while it gratifies my mo&s;t anxious wi&s;h in afford|ing me an opportunity of obliging her, leaves only this painful regret on my mind, that from credulity and remi&s;&s;ion I have allowed &s;uch an application to be made. To acknowledge and to protect the&s;e helple&s;s young women, was the un|doubted duty of a parent, and a duty, which, but for the mi&s;repre&s;entations of a &s;ecret enemy, &s;hould have been long ere now con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;charged. But <HI>to bind them to me by &s;till clo&s;er ties,</HI> to allow of an alliance with my grand&s;on, the &s;ource of my deare&s;t hopes and expecta|tions, to di&s;mi&s;s the pro&s;pect of a long cheri&s;hed &s;cheme, which mu&s;t have &s;e|cured to him connections of unbounded intere&s;t and importance, is a conce&s;&s;ion which Lady Aubrey alone could have procured&mdash;a revolution, that &s;he of the whole world only could have effected.

<P>THIS interview, &s;o anxiou&s;ly and &s;o long de&s;ired, took place ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey's eyes, at breakfa&s;t, be|trayed how the night had been pa&s;&s;ed; and as for my&s;elf, I felt as if I was on the eve of an event, the con&s;equences of which were formidable and precarious. Fanny &s;eemed to partake very little in the&s;e apprehen&s;ions. All her anxiety was in regard to my appearance, which &s;he wi&s;hed to render as agreeable as po&s;|&s;ible in my grandfather's eyes, as an apo|logy for the imprudence of Lord Linro&s;e's
<PB N="220" REF="227">
attachment; and &s;he helped to adju&s;t my dre&s;s with an eager anxiety that my un|ea&s;ine&s;s on Lady Aubrey's account hardly rendered me capable of attending to.</P>
<P>My Lord and Mr. Howard had agreed to ride out, that they might not be in the way when Lord Belmont was introduced to us; and about one his Lord&s;hip ar|rived, having &s;lept on the road, and tra|velled &s;lowly.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter and I trembled to leave Lady Aubrey in that &s;tate of agitation into which even the &s;ight of his carriage at a di&s;tance had thrown her; but we obeyed the hint &s;he gave us to allow her to re|ceive him alone; and having made her &s;wallow a few drops in water, we with|drew into the adjoining library, which is &s;eparated from her dre&s;&s;ing room only by a thin partition.</P>
<P>We had &s;carce tinne to enter it, when the found of &s;teps a&s;cending the &s;tairs threw me into a tremor not to be con|ceived.
<PB N="221" REF="228">
The door of the dre&s;&s;ing room was pre&s;ently after thrown open, and a &s;ervant pronounced the name of Lord Belmont and in&s;tantly withdrew.</P>
<P>A &s;hort &s;ilence en&s;ued, which terrified me with the apprehen&s;ion of Lady Au|brey's having fainted. This alarm was but too &s;oon confirmed, from hearing Lord Belmont call out, in a voice of hurry and afright&mdash;Who's there? Good God, who's there? and the bell was in|&s;tantly rung with great violence.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter and I, overpowered with ter|ror and forgetful of every thing but our dear and invaluable friend, then bur&s;t into the room. She had &s;unk upon the &s;opha, and lay in&s;en&s;ible, Lord Belmont hanging over her in all the de&s;pair of con&s;cious inability to afford her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>What a moment, in which for the fir&s;t time to behold our grandfather. Anxiou&s;ly as I had expected this inter|view, and formidable as it had appeared,
<PB N="222" REF="229">
I &s;carce regarded him; I almo&s;t forgot he was pre&s;ent; and flying to Lady Au|brey, I &s;upported her head in my trem|bling arms, while Fanny and the maid, who had been &s;ummoned from below, admini&s;tered &s;alts and be&s;prinkled her face with lavender water.</P>
<P>Seeing her beginning to recover, my &s;i&s;ter had the pre&s;ence of mind to &s;end away the maid, and Lady Aubrey &s;oon after opened her lovely eyes. Returning recollection made her feebly rai&s;e her head, as if to &s;eek Lord Belmont, who had prudently withdrawn behind from the fear that beholding him again too &s;uddenly might occa&s;ion a relap&s;e. But her emotions fortunately now took a le&s;s alarming turn; and cla&s;ping me in her arms as &s;he reclined upon my neck, the fullne&s;s of her heart got vent in tears and &s;obs that &s;eemed to rend her bo&s;om; while the conflict of my feelings was &s;o dreadful, that I cannot conceive how my
<PB N="223" REF="230">
&s;en&s;es &s;tood the &s;hock they &s;u&s;tained at that in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Lord Belmont, extremely affected, had moved towards us; but apprehen&s;ive of encrea&s;ing the violence of Lady Aubrey's feelings, and wholly &s;ubdued by his own, he &s;tood for a moment irre&s;olute whether or not he &s;hould advance. At length bur&s;ting into a violent flood of tears&mdash; by heavens this is too much! cried he, and &s;uddenly retreated as if unable to &s;upport this &s;cene.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey, as yet &s;carce capable of articulating, prevented his withdrawing by holding out her hand to him, which he ki&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t moving tender|ne&s;s; and &s;he fell into his arms in an agony of pathetic &s;orrow, which the mo&s;t hardened and in&s;en&s;ible could not have witne&s;&s;ed without being melted with compa&s;&s;ion. Lord Belmont's whole &s;oul &s;eemed &s;oftened into pity, and he wept immoderately.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="231">There is &s;omething peculiarly affecting in any violent expre&s;&s;ions of grief in an old man: one is &s;o little accu&s;tomed to behold them give way to the &s;ofter feel|ings, that when they bur&s;t the re&s;traints of fortitude, it appears a &s;ort of convul|&s;ion that is terrifying. Lady Aubrey, on perceiving the poignancy of his emo|tions, was in&s;tantly &s;eized with an alarm which &s;eemed to operate effectually in aiding her re-compo&s;ure, or rather in in&s;piring her with re&s;olution for &s;trug|gling to attain it. She was for a mo|ment calm&mdash;Oh my Lord! I am wound|ing, I am de&s;troying you, cried &s;he; but behold the all-powerful con&s;olation I promi&s;ed you&mdash;behold your children!</P>
<P>She di&s;engaged her&s;elf from his em|braces, and perhaps, Sophia, you will conclude that my &s;i&s;ter and I in&s;tantly fell at our grandfather's feet and im|plored his ble&s;&s;ing; but though this behaviour might have been more be|coming,
<PB N="225" REF="232">
and perhaps in &s;ome people more natural, <HI>my</HI> feelings operated very differently. The tenderne&s;s of his man|ner to Lady Aubrey, and the benevo|lent expre&s;&s;ion diffu&s;ed over his aged countenance, had at the fir&s;t glance de|prived him of the &s;tern a&s;pect with which my imagination had inve&s;ted him, and a &s;trong and obvious look of my dear father, which &s;truck that moment at my heart with the force of an electrical &s;hock, in&s;tead of throwing me on my knees conveyed me into his arms; where melted and &s;ubdued, had not &s;obs re|lieved me, I mu&s;t have fainted away.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter followed my example the moment I had a little recovered my&s;elf. He embraced us both with infinite affec|tion; and Lady Aubrey's tears flowed with a freedom and profu&s;ion that greatly relieved my apprehen&s;ions and her own &s;ufferings.</P>

hour, &s;aid Lord Belmont. I &s;hall be enabled pre&s;ently to behold my dear daughters with more compo&s;ure, and their gentle hearts will be fortified by my ab&s;ence. Is there not a &s;on too, to whom I have &s;till to be introduced. I will find Linro&s;e, and de&s;ire him to pre|&s;ent me to Mr. Howard.</P>
<P>I perceive they are ju&s;t returned, cried Fanny, who had &s;een them from the windows; and my Lord left us with precipitation under pretence of going to join them.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant he was gone, the momen|tary compo&s;ure which Lady Aubrey had laboured to maintain entirely for&s;ook her, and the violence of her perturbation was &s;ucceeded by a weakne&s;s, languor, and depre&s;&s;ion, that &s;eemed wholly to overpower her, and rendered me ex|tremely apprehen&s;ive that this interview would be far from promoting the com|fort and tranquillity of her mind. By
<PB N="227" REF="234">
the time that Lord Belmont returned, however, &s;he was &s;edate and collected, yet both her health and looks have evi|dently &s;uffered, though thank heaven not very materially, from this &s;hock.</P>
<P>Eager to avoid any &s;ubject that might lead to mournful retro&s;pections, Lord Belmont anxiou&s;ly entered into conver&s;a|tion on matters le&s;s affecting, but equally intere&s;ting. He de&s;ired a particular ac|count of our &s;ituation in all re&s;pects from our arrival in England to my &s;i&s;ter's marriage, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf much plea&s;ed with Mr. Howard, to whom he had been introduced below. Both his expre&s;&s;ion and his manner were kind to exce&s;s; and he blamed him&s;elf &s;everely for the part he had been induced to act. I mu&s;t endeavour to atone to my chil|dren, &s;aid he, for my pa&s;t behaviour in a way that I hope will bani&s;h it from their remembrance though the recollec|tion ever mu&s;t wound my own.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="235">I could have told him, had I been able to &s;ummon courage, that one word from his lips had already more than atoned for fifty times the unea&s;ine&s;s his rejection had occa&s;ioned; but I could only pre&s;s his hand, as he held mine in his. I al|mo&s;t think he under&s;tood this &s;ilent token of gratitude, for he embraced me affec|tionately.</P>
<P>Lord Linro&s;e and Mr. Howard having allowed a &s;ufficient time for this expla|natory conver&s;ation, then entered. The appearance of the former for the fir&s;t few minutes overwhelmed me with confu&s;ion. I recollected the repugnance with which my grandfather had &s;o long li&s;tened to his &s;olicitations in my behalf, and re|called with pain the reluctant con&s;ent which Lady Aubrey's interference had extorted. My confidence however was &s;oon re&s;tored by the extreme affection and conde&s;cen&s;ion of Lord Belmont; who, as if he had penetrated into my thoughts
<PB N="229" REF="236">
and read my embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;eemed to make me the object of his peculiar re|gard. He received, with infinite marks of &s;atisfaction, all the little attentions which the plea&s;ing idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a parent who claimed them excited from my &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf, was delighted with the information of our progre&s;s in dif|ferent accompli&s;hments, &s;uch as mu&s;ic, painting, &amp;c. advantages which Lady Aubrey took care to di&s;play with all the exaggeration of maternal partiality, and when we were &s;eating our&s;elves at table, ordered Lord Linro&s;e to give him up the place of which he was about to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion between Lady Aubrey and me. You begin to monopolize before your time, Sir, &s;aid he with a &s;mile that co|vered me with blu&s;hes. He is indeed the mo&s;t amiable old man I ever beheld, and mu&s;t have been uncommonly hand|&s;ome I think in his youth; though I will not deny but that an air of con&s;cious
<PB N="230" REF="237">
dignity, accompanied even with a look of au&s;terity, is diffu&s;ed over it, that may not at fir&s;t &s;ight prove prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in the eyes of a &s;tranger. But to his friends and to his children, he appears only what in fact he is, all conde&s;cen&s;ion and be|nevolence. His re&s;emblance to my fa|ther is &s;o obvious, that he recalls him every in&s;tant to my remembrance, and you may recollect how much you u&s;ed to admire the noble expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>his</HI> countenance.</P>
<P>Were his tenderne&s;s to my &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf wholly out of the que&s;tion, his behaviour to Lady Aubrey would en|tirely gain my heart. Every look te&s;ti|fies the warmth of his admiration and re|&s;pect; even the very tone of his voice on addre&s;&s;ing her, is expre&s;&s;ive of af|fection; and on her part, though the agitating &s;cene of the morning &s;eemed to have unhinged her nerves and wholly exhau&s;ted her &s;trength and &s;pirits, his
<PB N="231" REF="238">
Lord&s;hip's tenderne&s;s appears to have recruited both. She is truly &s;en&s;ible of his goodne&s;s; and receives all his at|tentions with a mournful plea&s;ure, which while it revives her &s;orrows, and encrea&s;es her melancholy, &s;ooths and gratifies her heart.</P>
<P>Hurt by the idea of overclouding the happine&s;s (which however combated by &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion. Lord Bel|mont's arrival had univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed) &s;he exerted her&s;elf ye&s;terday evening to appear chearful; but the effort was ap|parent: &s;he conver&s;ed on indifferent to|pics with &s;eeming intere&s;t; but it was ea&s;y to divine that her thoughts were not pre&s;ent; and at la&s;t &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould &s;it down to the harp&s;ichord and &s;ing to my grandfather a little French air, which he had &s;aid he particularly admired. The fir&s;t few notes however obliged her to leave the room, and I found it impo&s;&s;ible to proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239">This day, thank heaven, I think her &s;pirits are le&s;s depre&s;&s;ed. She had a long private conver&s;ation in the morning with Lord Belmont, chiefly in regard to our affairs, and &s;eems to have been more re|lieved than affected by it. My Lord acknowledged to her every circum&s;tance of the conduct of Lady Linro&s;e, but re|que&s;ted that particular care might be taken not to encrea&s;e the re&s;entment of her &s;on by an open avowal of the unge|nerous part &s;he has &s;ecretly acted.</P>
<P>Her behaviour, &s;aid my Lord, has betrayed a degree of meanne&s;s, art, and duplicity, which convince me &s;he is ca|pable of any &s;tep, however irregular, from which &s;he has hopes of attaining a favourite point. <HI>I</HI> &s;hall my&s;elf therefore break off all connection with her in fu|ture; but I &s;hould be &s;orry to involve Linro&s;e in a difference with his mother, and if our Hermione be as amiable as her lovely countenance be&s;peaks her,
<PB N="233" REF="240">
&s;he will incline to &s;often rather than ex|a&s;perate an indignation too ju&s;tly excited. Oh Sophia! how proud and how plea&s;ed did this partial compliment from my grandfather make me.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey a&s;&s;ured him of my paci|fic di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;aid &s;he was certain I would be infinitely &s;hocked with the apprehen&s;ion of occa&s;ioning a rupture between them. I am convinced, added &s;he, that her pre&s;ent happine&s;s has al|ready obliterated from her mind all re|&s;entment in regard to Lady Linro&s;e; yet when &s;he recalls the comfortle&s;s, uncon|nected &s;ituation in which &s;he and her &s;i&s;ter found them&s;elves at the very mo|ment that &s;he &s;o unfeelingly tran&s;mitted to them the account of your Lord&s;hip's determination, a determination which undoubtedly her own mi&s;repre&s;entations had effected, there is perhaps &s;ome lit|tle merit in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing indignation.</P>
<P>As an apology for the unkindne&s;s of
<PB N="234" REF="241">
my conduct, &s;aid my Lord, I mu&s;t re|que&s;t you, my dear Madam, to peru&s;e this letter, which I received from Lady Linro&s;e in December la&s;t.</P>
<P>Lady Aubrey immediately read it; and afterwards repeated to us the con|tents as faithfully as her memory could retail them.</P>
<P>Lady Linro&s;e began by informing Lord Belmont that &s;he was about to ac|quaint him with an affair that had given her infinite vexation, and which &s;he was afraid would involve his Lord&s;hip in much difficulty and unea&s;ine&s;s. She then tells him that his two granddaughters had taken the imprudent &s;tep (without any previous application or advice) of coming over to England; where they had lately arrived merely attended by a gentleman, who it was &s;aid was much devoted to them. After imprudently lodging all together in the hou&s;e of a woman of very doubtful character, and
<PB N="235" REF="242">
a&s;&s;ociating almo&s;t &s;olely with the famous Mrs. Weldon, with whom they had been intimate abroad, who was kept at pre|&s;ent by a profligate young man of for|tune, they had applied to her (Lady Linro&s;e) as a relation from whom they expected countenance and civilities; and to this, her Lady&s;hip adds, they would ju&s;tly have been entitled, had not the glaring impropriety of their conduct rendered any attention on her part, on account of her daughters, wholly out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e were circum&s;tances, &s;he &s;aid, much to be regretted: but alas this un|expected journey to England had been attended by con&s;equences &s;till more di&s;|agreeable, and indeed truly alarming: her &s;on Roat&s;ley had accidentally &s;een and was become pa&s;&s;ionately enamoured of the elde&s;t of the&s;e girls; though from a &s;ingular train of particulars, too te|dious to retail, added to their having re|tained
<PB N="236" REF="243">
the name by which they had been hitherto known, he was &s;till ignorant of the relation&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. Artful, beautiful, and de&s;igning, this young woman had &s;pread every &s;nare of coquetry and in&s;inuation to cap|tivate him, in which &s;he had &s;o entirely &s;ucceeded that he was blind to her im|prudence, nor would li&s;ten to any at|tempts made by his friends to open his eyes.</P>
<P>She had no doubt, her Lady&s;hip con|tinued, but the ladies would &s;oon pre|vail with Roat&s;ley to intercede with his Lord&s;hip in their favour, though as yet no explanation on that head &s;eemed to have taken place between them; and added, that were it not for the unfortu|nate circum&s;tance of his attachment, which ab&s;olutely required every po&s;&s;ible check and di&s;couragement, it would doubtle&s;s have been a natural and hu|mane act to have endeavoured to re&s;train
<PB N="237" REF="244">
the conduct of the girls within the bounds of propriety and decency; and to effect this de&s;irable end, the notice and protection of their friends might have proved conducive: but at pre&s;ent &s;he was convinced any favour or atten|tions afforded them would but give life to tho&s;e romantic hopes which the de|pendent and unconnected ob&s;curity of their &s;ituation had hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>She then de&s;ires to have his Lord&s;hip's commands in what manner &s;he &s;hould conduct her&s;elf on the occa&s;ion, to which &s;he promi&s;es the mo&s;t dutiful and impli|cit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and reque&s;ts that his Lord&s;hip may not on any account allow her &s;on to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he had ever en|tered with him on this &s;ubject, as it could &s;erve no purpo&s;e but that of pro|ducing endle&s;s quarrels and altercations between them, and he would be apt to <HI>&s;u&s;pect her</HI> (&s;he adds) of having prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him again&s;t them. Her Lady&s;hip,
<PB N="238" REF="245">
after a great deal more to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, concludes with the&s;e words, which Lady Aubrey repeated verbatim, "the young ladies, I under&s;tand, intend ad|dre&s;&s;ing your Lord&s;hip in a letter, which I &s;hall take particular care to di&s;patch the moment it is committed to my charge."</P>
<P>This letter, however, my Lord in|formed Lady Aubrey, never had arrived, though Lady Linro&s;e in her next in|formed him that &s;he had &s;ent it off &s;ome days before. I was little &s;olicitous, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, about the fate of an epi&s;tle which the alarm I had received from the intelligence of my grand&s;on's folly ren|dered me unwilling to peru&s;e; but I doubt if it was ever intended for my &s;ight, from the moment in which it reached the hands of that artful woman. At the time however no &s;u&s;picion even entered my thoughts. Shocked at the danger which threatened all my favourite &s;chemes for Linro&s;e, I in&s;tantly de&s;ired
<PB N="239" REF="246">
his mother by every means in her power to di&s;courage his pa&s;&s;ion, and to prevent the &s;lighte&s;t intercour&s;e between her fa|mily and the&s;e imprudent girls, who&s;e ill conduct, added to my grand&s;on's in|fatuation, determined me to renounce them; and I ordered her to a&s;&s;ure them that my re&s;olution neither to behold nor acknowledge them was irrevocable. I made enquiry however in what &s;ituation they were in regard to fortune, and was plea&s;ed to find that their finances were in a &s;ituation that required not the inter|ference of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Even this ac|count, Linro&s;e tells me, was fal&s;e; for the unlucky failure of their guardian rendered their circum&s;tances &s;o uncom|fortable that an application was made to him by one of their friends for &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which I believe he intended to convey in the mo&s;t delicate manner he could contrive under the borrowed form of a pen&s;ion from government.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="247">On this head, &s;aid Lady Aubrey, I mu&s;t exculpate Lady Linro&s;e from blame; for the circum&s;tance of Mr. Ben&s;eley's affairs I am convinced never, came to her knowledge; and when &s;he informed your Lord&s;hip that their &s;itua|tion required no aid, &s;he was her&s;elf probably of that opinion. I mu&s;t like|wi&s;e ob&s;erve, that though this account of their &s;ituation received from her pen all the exaggeration that art and preju|dice could give it, yet it is po&s;&s;ible that upon her fir&s;t private enquiries in regard to them, &s;he might have conceived a very unju&s;t and unfavourable opinion of their behaviour. A variety of injurious rumours were the di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quence of their imprudence in lodging with a woman of who&s;e character they were not particularly informed; and the unlucky intimacy which for a &s;hort time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them and Mrs. Wel|don, owing to that abandoned woman's having
<PB N="241" REF="248">
art in getting admitted into very re&s;pec|table &s;ociety abroad, mu&s;t have confirmed her error.</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, &s;aid Lord Belmont; but when &s;he was her&s;elf undeceived, then, in honour, in ju&s;tice, &s;he was bound to have removed the di&s;gu&s;t &s;he had implanted: but in&s;tead of pur&s;uing this path, the whole of her conduct di&s;|covers the mo&s;t de&s;picable and ungene|rous artifice. In a late letter dated from Holtenham Abbey, &s;he tells me that my grandchildren are behaving with greater propriety than could have been expected; that the younge&s;t had lately married the gentleman who had attended them from the Continent, a circum&s;tance &s;he ob|&s;erves that <HI>looked well</HI>; and that her &s;i&s;ter re&s;ided with them in that county, where they lived with credit. As they were but lately arrived and little known, nobody there &s;he &s;ays &s;eemed acquainted with their late levity of conduct. This
<PB N="242" REF="249">
decorum, whether real or a&s;&s;umed merely for the purpo&s;e of deceiving Linro&s;e, was extremely alarming, &s;he adds, as they had acquired a reputation which youth and beauty, when attended with art, &s;eldom found it difficult to obtain, where a favourite point was at &s;take. Thus, by working forcibly on my ap|prehen&s;ions in regard to my grand&s;on, and repre&s;enting my granddaughters in this unfavourable point of view, &s;he evi|dently aimed at prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing me &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t them, as to render me on my return neither particular in my enquiries nor in any way &s;olicitous about them: while at the &s;ame time, &s;hould at length the real truth tran&s;pire, &s;he pre|&s;erved the &s;alvo of having been her&s;elf deceived.</P>
<P>To the&s;e accu&s;ations Lady Aubrey could have added the artful vi&s;it &s;he made at Hubert Hill, and the feigned civilities and expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip
<PB N="243" REF="250">
by which &s;he had endeavoured to gain our confidence and lull her &s;on's &s;u&s;pi|cions, as affording her the means of &s;e|parating us from Lord Belmont with greater facility and le&s;s danger of detec|tion; but unwilling to exa&s;perate where &s;he was certain <HI>I</HI> would wi&s;h to recon|cile, Lady Aubrey forbore acquainting him with this part of her behaviour.</P>
<P>She di&s;covered however, in the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation, that Lord Linro&s;e had partly hinted to him the approbation and admiration with which his mother had beheld us; but this having been followed by no particulars, and Lord Linro&s;e having merely advanced that circum&s;tance during the heat of their al|tercation as an argument in our favour, it had made no great impre&s;&s;ion on Lord Belmont's mind. I &s;hould be much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, Sophia, to be the means of occa&s;ioning divi&s;ions in a family with whom I am &s;oon to be &s;o intimately con|nected.
<PB N="244" REF="251">
I &s;hall endeavour therefore as much as is po&s;&s;ible to keep all aggra|vating additions from Lord Belmont's knowledge, as well as to per&s;uade Lord Linro&s;e into conciliating mea&s;ures; who, though he is withheld from openly te&s;ti|fying his re&s;entment, cannot talk of his mother's conduct with patience, even while he is ignorant of the extent of her artifice.</P>
<P>After this full and candid explanation, my Lord expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t flattering terms his warm approba|tion of his grand&s;on's choice, and &s;poke of me with a partial admiration that de|lighted the heart of our invaluable friend; and on being faithfully repeated to me, filled mine with gratitude and plea&s;ure. Linro&s;e, he &s;aid, was impatient to have matters concluded; and indeed, con&s;idering the happine&s;s that awaited him, his eagerne&s;s was both natural and excu&s;able; the ceremony therefore
<PB N="245" REF="252">
&s;hould be no longer delayed, than till the papers and &s;ettlements could be made out.</P>
<P>Having concluded this minute detail, I have one favour to reque&s;t of my Hermione, added Lady Aubrey, and I flatter my&s;elf &s;he will not refu&s;e me. It is that you will not think of leaving this hou&s;e, my love, till you have given your hand to Lord Linro&s;e. Let me have the plea&s;ure of thinking, that as under this roof you have experienced the mo&s;t painful moments that hopele&s;s love could &s;end, under this roof your future happine&s;s has he &s;ecured as far as the affection, gratitude, and admiration of a tender hu&s;band can &s;ecure it.</P>
<P>To this kind reque&s;t you may believe I gave a grateful and willing a&s;&s;ent, provided Lord Belmont approved of the propo&s;al. I even entreated that &s;he would endeavour if po&s;&s;ible to prevail with him to agree to it; for I am ex|tremely
<PB N="246" REF="253">
apprehen&s;ive, from a hint he let drop this morning, that he has got the frightful intention of giving to this affair the air of a formal celebration, by inviting di&s;tant relations of the family, and introducing pomp and ceremonials where privacy with a very few friends is &s;o much more &s;uitable to the awful &s;o|lemnity of the occa&s;ion. Lord Belmont, it is not difficult to perceive, is not ea&s;ily moved by per&s;ua&s;ion to alter a deter|mined purpo&s;e; but heaven grant that in this in&s;tance, as in &s;o many &s;till more arduous, Lady Aubrey's unbounded in|fluence may prevail.</P>

<P>Lord Linro&s;e and I, who contrive to &s;teal a private walk, every morning be|fore breakfa&s;t, had a violent di&s;pute during our early ramble to-day. He
<PB N="247" REF="254">
in&s;i&s;ted that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for waiting the tedious forms of law, &s;ince they could go on at lei&s;ure fully as well after as before the ceremony was per|formed; and to defer it till Dudley Mount was fitted up for our reception was, he &s;aid, the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and ab&s;urd formality, when &s;o many kind friends were quarrelling who &s;hould have the fir&s;t vi&s;it from us; and at all events we could take up our re&s;idence if we cho&s;e it at Alton Park with Lord Belmont.</P>
<P>I did not wi&s;h to appear affected: yet ihe pro&s;pect of an event that I had believed at the di&s;tance of &s;ome weeks, threw me into con&s;ternation; and the urgency with which my Lord laboured to reconcile me to this ha&s;ty &s;cheme, con|vinced me he would ea&s;ily contrive to &s;urmount any ob&s;tacles that Lord Bel|mont might oppo&s;e to it.</P>
<P>I therefore entreated him to give over all thoughts of &s;o precipitate a plan, and
<PB N="248" REF="255">
to wait till every thing was quietly and properly adju&s;ted. In the mean while I told him I &s;hould divide my time equally between Hubert Hill and Au|brey Ca&s;tle; and as he mu&s;t find him|&s;elf equally at home at both tho&s;e places, we might contrive to be con&s;tantly to|gether.</P>
<P>My arguments were without effect. <HI>He</HI> continued to per&s;uade and <HI>I</HI> to re|mon&s;trate. I think, at length cried he laughing, no plan remains for me but one, and that one is &s;o natural on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and mu&s;t appear to all who hear of it &s;o happy a termination to tho&s;e endle&s;s difficulties and punctilios, that though you may not approve of the &s;cheme I make no doubt time and con|trition might prevail with you to forgive it: at lea&s;t I may venture to hazard your di&s;plea&s;ure in a cau&s;e that would &s;o am|ply recompence me for the utmo&s;t &s;e|venty of its effect. I &s;hall have my

carriage and &s;ervants in waiting to carry you off &s;ome morning when you are walk|ing, and my grandfather's chaplain will have no &s;cruples to deter him from per|forming a ceremony that is merely de|ferred from motives of ab&s;urd propriety.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce fini&s;hed this &s;entence, when Lord Belmont &s;uddenly joined us from the next walk. He &s;miled at my confu&s;ion; but kindly taking my hand, had you really attempted this wild &s;cheme &s;ome weeks ago, Linro&s;e, &s;aid he, I might have been <HI>offended</HI>; but I think, con&s;idering the temptation, I could not po&s;&s;ibly have been <HI>&s;urpri&s;ed</HI>; however you may now &s;ummon a little patience to your aid, and a few weeks will ad|ju&s;t every thing to your &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A few weeks, my Lord! exclaimed Lord Linro&s;e. Your Lord&s;hip requires patience with a vengeance; but there is not the &s;lighte&s;t chance that mine will hold out one third of the time.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="257">I implored him by a look to defer the &s;ubject, but it was with evident difficulty and reluctance he obeyed me.</P>
<P>Well, Linro&s;e, we &s;hall &s;ee, cried Lord Belmont, and we &s;oon after reached the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The family were ju&s;t a&s;&s;embled at breakfa&s;t; and Lady Aubrey appeared in better looks and &s;pirits than &s;he has enjoyed &s;ince the receipt of Lord Bel|mont's letter. The company were all gaiety; and Lord Linro&s;e having whi&s;|pered to Mrs. Howard the circum&s;tance of Lord Belmont having detected our morning tete a tete, &s;he had the giddine&s;s to &s;ay aloud that &s;he under&s;tood an elope|ment was projected from Aubrey Ca&s;tle, which &s;he doubted not would &s;oon take place unle&s;s Lord Belmont interfered to protect the injured honour of his family.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid my Lord, I mu&s;t protect my daughter from the effects of an impetu|o&s;ity, which I &s;u&s;pect will require all her
<PB N="251" REF="258">
gentlene&s;s and good &s;en&s;e to keep within proper bounds; but I &s;ee no method &s;o well calculated for promoting this end as the one I am convinced &s;he will be apt on all occa&s;ions to adopt&mdash;that of <HI>yielding the point.</HI> You and I, my dear Madam, added he to Lady Aubrey, will di&s;cu&s;s this matter afterwards.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t of all ways of <HI>gaining a point,</HI> cried Fanny, and a mo&s;t abomina|ble precedent for married women. I hope at lea&s;t my &s;i&s;ter won't think of introducing it at Hubert Hill.</P>
<P>Lord Belmont, with whom &s;he is a great favourite, told her that he was convinced, as &s;he had got the &s;tart of me in matrimony, I &s;hould in &s;o acting merely follow the example &s;et me by my younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter. I &s;oon contrived to e&s;cape from this conver&s;ation, in which I found it impo&s;&s;ible to join; and the moment I was gone, Lord Linro&s;e earne&s;tly entreat|ed Lady Aubrey to endeavour to reconcile
<PB N="252" REF="259">
me to a &s;peedy celebration. The matter being then debated in full council, it was at length determined that our marriage &s;hould be concluded at Aubrey Ca&s;tle; and that the day following the whole party &s;hould &s;et off together for Hubert Hill, the vicinity of which &s;ituation to Dudley Mount rendered it a convenient re&s;idence for Lord Linro&s;e as well as an agreeable one for all the others.</P>
<P>This being re&s;olved, though without my having been con&s;ulted on the matter, Lord Linro&s;e flew to find me in order to communicate this &s;udden change of mea|&s;ures. I was quietly &s;eated in the li|brary, though not very bu&s;y at my &s;tu|dies when he entered. My deare&s;t Mi&s;s Seymour, cried he, a plan has been pro|po&s;ed and univer&s;ally approved of, which I hope you will not be &s;o inhuman as to oppo&s;e by any cold and fruitle&s;s ob|jections. Lord Belmont, Lady Aubrey, and in &s;hort our whole friends, join in
<PB N="253" REF="260">
opinion that the &s;ooner my happine&s;s is completed the better; and a thou&s;and rea&s;ons, independent of my impatience, con&s;pire to render it not merely proper but nece&s;&s;ary. Lady Aubrey, who&s;e maternal affection ju&s;tly entitles her to every maternal privilege, with her u&s;ual unbounded goodne&s;s has conde&s;cended to name the very day of my happine&s;s; and Wedne&s;day next, my deare&s;t Her|mione, will behold me the mo&s;t envied of mankind. Oh! generou&s;ly tell me that you will not invent unnece&s;&s;ary de|lays&mdash;tell me that you he&s;itate no longer.</P>
<P>I did not affect a reluctance to oblige him: but agitated as I was, con&s;ented with that &s;oothing &s;atisfaction that ever attends our compliance to the entreaties of tho&s;e we anxiou&s;ly de&s;ire to plea&s;e. The gratitude of Lord Linro&s;e was as fervent as had been his urgency. But hearing &s;ome per&s;on on the &s;tairs, I made
<PB N="254" REF="261">
my e&s;cape to my own dre&s;&s;ing room, where Lady Aubrey &s;oon joined me.</P>
<P>She repeated to me the above infor|mation; and told me, that warmly ex|periencing the tender anxieties of a mother, &s;he had ventured to a&s;&s;ume the rights of that character in fixing the day and may heaven, my Hermione, render every anniver&s;ary of Wedne&s;day next more tranquil than that awful day can prove that unites us even to what our hearts hold mo&s;t dear on earth, and if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more happy.</P>
<P>Oh! Sophia! in four days my fate will be determined. Mr. Price, the hu&s;|band of our friend Mi&s;s Par&s;ons, who I find was originally tutor to Lord Lin|ro&s;e and is particularly e&s;teemed by him, has it &s;eems long indulged the hopes of performing one day the &s;acred ceremony that mu&s;t a&s;certain his pupil's happine&s;s or mi&s;ery in life; and a me&s;&s;enger has been actually di&s;patched to him, de&s;iring
<PB N="255" REF="262">
his attendance here on Wedne&s;day. On this occa&s;ion Lady Aubrey willingly con|&s;ented to Fanny's reque&s;t that Mrs. Price &s;hould be invited to accompany her hu&s;|band; and as I thought our little friend would be gratified with the compliment, I did not oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Adieu, my beloved friend! for the fir&s;t and la&s;t time of my a&s;&s;uming the name, let me &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. TO MISS BEAUMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>HUBERT HILL,
<DATE>AUG. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ONCE more, my deare&s;t Sophia, I write from Hubert Hill. This delight|ful
<PB N="256" REF="263">
little abode, where, accompanied by the happy party from Aubrey Ca&s;tle, I arrived on Friday forenoon.</P>
<P>Your Hermione, in pre&s;ence of the&s;e dear and amiable friends, gave her hand to Lord Linro&s;e on Wedne&s;day la&s;t. No addition was made to the family on that occa&s;ion, Mr. and Mrs. Price ex|cepted, from whom we parted on Thur&s;|day morning, as this little man&s;ion could not have contained more vi&s;itors than at pre&s;ent are its inhabitants.</P>
<P>We were charmed to perceive the agreeable alteration which an ea&s;y mind and comfortable circum&s;tances have pro|duced in the looks of Mrs. Price. Her hu&s;band is a very amiable man; and her &s;ituation is in all re&s;pects as happy as it lately was the rever&s;e. Mrs. Hindon, &s;he told us, had received her, now her affairs no longer require her aid, with prodigious kindne&s;s, and had given her and Mr. Price an invitation to &s;pend &s;ome
<PB N="257" REF="264">
weeks at her hou&s;e; but though I &s;hall always continue on good terms with my aunt, &s;aid &s;he, I have had enough of her family, and &s;hall not be in ha&s;te to accept her offer.</P>
<P>The formidable day, my Sophia, was pa&s;&s;ed in our u&s;ual way. Lady Aubrey, who always judges with peculiar good &s;en&s;e and propriety, would allow of no forms. Every thing went on as it had done on the preceding day, excepting that the &s;ervants and tenants had a ball and plentiful dinner provided for them in the hall; but as there was no nece&s;&s;ity for my making my appearance, I merely partook of their mirth from hearing the di&s;tant &s;ound of the fiddles from below.</P>
<P>A licence having been procured, Mr. Price performed the ceremony; after which we &s;at down as u&s;ual to our cu&s;|tomary employments, and cards and backgammon divided the evening. Lady Aubrey's agitation during the &s;ervice
<PB N="258" REF="265">
almo&s;t equalled mine; but thank heaven her &s;pirits of late have been chearful and compo&s;ed, and I tru&s;t every &s;uc|ceeding day will bring her additional comfort and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The company of Lady Linro&s;e, on this occa&s;ion, you may &s;uppo&s;e was nei|ther expected nor de&s;ired. Lord Lin|ro&s;e had in a cold letter informed her of the event a few days before it took place; but the pre&s;ence of Lord Bel|mont, who had written her in a very deci&s;ive manner that they mu&s;t meet no more, afforded an ea&s;y pretext for not reque&s;ting that of her Lady&s;hip. All the notice Lord Linro&s;e took of this rupture was, to tell her that as his grandfather appeared offended by &s;ome private par|ticulars of her Lady&s;hip's conduct, it was not in his power to &s;olicit the ho|nour of a vi&s;it from her on the occa&s;ion of an event which a multiplicity of mi&s;|repre&s;entations
<PB N="259" REF="266">
and mi&s;takes has unhap|pily too long deferred.</P>
<P>On the evening of the day on which we got hither we all walked out, to &s;hew Lord Belmont the beauties of this charming place; and oh! Sophia! what an altered a&s;pect every object wore, from the languor that &s;o lately inve&s;ted them. Lord Linro&s;e led the way to the &s;pot by the &s;ide of the river, once the &s;cene of &s;o much confu&s;ion and perplexity to me, when he &s;tole upon me unperceived and fir&s;t made the di&s;covery of my affections. He had the delicacy however to make no other ob&s;ervation on the occa&s;ion than to talk of the romantic beauty of the &s;itua|tion with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration that evidently be&s;poke &s;ome &s;ecret &s;ource of partiality. His looks however were &s;uf|ficiently expre&s;&s;ive; and he pre&s;&s;ed the hand that leaned on his arm with all the fervour of gratitude. Pray, cried he &s;miling, what is become of the pretty
<PB N="260" REF="267">
little child that u&s;ed to pay you frequent vi&s;its here.</P>
<P>I could not recall the teizing curio&s;ity of Charlotte's behaviour without laugh|ing heartily from that plea&s;ed &s;en&s;ation with which one recollects pa&s;t vexations, now converted into enjoyment by the pre&s;ent happy rever&s;e; and I related to my Lord, as we walked, the additional angui&s;h which the little girl's per&s;ecution had given me during his mother's vi&s;it. Oh! with what gratitude did I rai&s;e my heart to heaven for the innumerable ble&s;&s;ings that &s;urrounded me.</P>
<P>As it grew late, Lord Belmont, who dreaded the damps of the evening, per|&s;uaded Lady Aubrey to return with him to the hou&s;e, and Mr. and Mrs. Howard attended them: but my Lord and I pro|longed our walk for a full hour longer. Every object around afforded &s;ome in|tere&s;ting &s;ubject for retracing pa&s;t un|ea&s;ine&s;s and for contemplating with de|lighted
<PB N="261" REF="268">
thankfulne&s;s the pre&s;ent happy contra&s;t. Every interview between us was remembered, every conver&s;ation where prudence on the one &s;ide and ti|midity on the other pre&s;ided, was anna|lized and inve&s;tigated, and the &s;ecret mo|tives of every action acknowledged.</P>
<P>When at length we returned to the hou&s;e, we found cards of congratulation from Lady Mary Lawrence and Lady Elizabeth; and this morning I have re|ceived a letter from Lady Linro&s;e her|&s;elf, who &s;ends me her felicitations with all the ea&s;e of a per&s;on who is uncon|&s;cious of ever having intended to injure me. Lord Linro&s;e coloured with indig|nation on peru&s;ing it. This is effrontery with a vengeance, &s;aid he: but the ap|proach of Lord Belmont &s;ealed his lips.</P>
<P>I have an&s;wered her with polite re|&s;erve. She expects, &s;he &s;ays, to be fa|voured with a vi&s;it from her &s;on and his <HI>amiable bride,</HI> as &s;oon as the parade
<PB N="262" REF="269">
of receiving vi&s;its is at an end; but I fear it will not be in my power to per|&s;uade Lord Linro&s;e to conde&s;cend to this, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time; and I have told her that as we have e&s;caped for the pre&s;ent the di&s;agreeable ceremonials &s;he mentions, by taking up our re&s;idence with my brother and &s;i&s;ter, we mu&s;t de|vote &s;ome weeks to the&s;e duties when Dudley Mount becomes our re&s;idence, for which rea&s;on it is not in our power to fix any determined period for waiting upon her Lady&s;hip. I have de&s;ired to be particularly remembered to the &s;weet Lucy; and indeed I promi&s;e my&s;elf much plea&s;ure from cultivating her friend&s;hip. Her brother is pa&s;&s;ionately attached to her; and means if po&s;&s;ible to prevail with her to join our family, as the unaccountable preference given by Lady Linro&s;e to Mi&s;s Dudley renders home extremely unplea&s;ant, and his
<PB N="263" REF="270">
mother, he &s;ays, he is convinced will have no objection to part with her.</P>
<P>Lord Belmont, who&s;e affection to|wards my &s;i&s;ter and me &s;eems hourly to encrea&s;e, has pre&s;ented Fanny with ten thou&s;and pounds. This comfortable ad|dition to Mr. Howard's fortune gives them every thing they de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s; for now that Lord Linro&s;e and I are about to &s;ettle within four miles of them, Fanny has not a wi&s;h beyond the limits of the county, and her hu&s;band's ta&s;te leads him wholly to the enjoyment of a country life. His Lord&s;hip's &s;ettlements upon his grand&s;on and me are noble; but as I am very little &s;olicitous about the&s;e matters, I &s;hall wave particulars. My Lord, who is fond of rural &s;ports, intends that we &s;hall &s;pend great part of the year at Dudley Mount; a re&s;olution which gives me infinite plea&s;ure. He is &s;ick of the frivolous amu&s;ements of London, and I have no plea&s;ure in them.
<PB N="264" REF="271">
I now po&s;&s;e&s;s all my heart can wi&s;h, and happy in the &s;ociety of tho&s;e I &s;incerely and fervently love, I wi&s;h not to en|large my circle beyond what politene&s;s and propriety demand.</P>
