<HEAD>The CASE of Mr. LAW truly &s;tated.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THERE has been a Pamph|let publi&s;h'd here, enti|tiled, <HI>A Letter</HI> to you (Mr. <HI>Law</HI>) which has partly banter'd you, and partly flatter'd you in a kind of a flouri&s;hing but &s;uperficial Way; leaving us altoge|ther in the Dark, at the Clo&s;e, as to the Author's Meaning, <HI>or indeed whether he has any Meaning or no,</HI> other than to have you &s;poken of and made a little obnoxious; and this indeed &s;eems to be the principal De&s;ign of the Book; if, as I &s;ay above, there is any real De&s;ign in it: or if not this, then by &s;etting out your great Ca|pacities, and perhaps more than your own Mode&s;ty will &s;uffer you to acknowledge, prepare us to expect &s;ome great Things from you here, and to receive them well when they &s;hall be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erv'd among the Boys in our Streets, (<HI>with your Pardon for the Allu&s;ion</HI>) when &s;ometimes one more quarrel&s;ome
<PB N="4" REF="5">
than his Fellows falls upon another, and offers him any Violence, that the ordinary return of the injur'd Boy is thus; <HI>Let me alone, I don't meddle with you:</HI> The natural Ju&s;tice in that Reply, <HI>however Boyi&s;h,</HI> is very pungent; and as this Book call'd a Letter, or the Letter call'd a Book, has thus offer'd you a Piece of &s;imple, empty, unmeaning Violence, it would be a full An&s;wer for Mr. <HI>Law</HI> to &s;ay to the rheto|cial Author, no more than this, <HI>Let me a|lone, I don't meddle with you.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is come among us, and though he does <HI>not meddle</HI> with us, we <HI>will meddle</HI> with him; give me leave, Sir, to addre&s;s you in another manner, per|haps with more Plainne&s;s and fewer Flou|ri&s;hes, yet with more Ju&s;tice to you, and as much to our &s;elves: In order to this, I mu&s;t fir&s;t ask your leave to follow him a little in his too partial Hi&s;tory of your late Tran&s;actions <HI>abroad, as al&s;o</HI> in his Pa|rallel with ours at home.</P>
<P>What you did in <HI>France,</HI> and how or to what extravagance Things were run up there, is nothing at all to us; be&s;ides, if this Author's Hi&s;tory of you is ju&s;t, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that your Scheme was right, and that the extravagant advance of things was again&s;t your Judgment, and oppo&s;ed by you with all your Might; but that you were over|ruled
<PB N="5" REF="6">
by tho&s;e <HI>who had an Influence at Court at that Time,</HI> and who had wor&s;e De&s;igns: <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> if his Hi&s;tory is ju&s;t, all the Di&s;a|&s;ters which have happen'd there are no|thing at all to you. But on the contrary, he &s;uppo&s;es you had been able to have carry'd on all your Schemes with Succe&s;s, and every thing would have an&s;wer'd it &s;elf; and that you were &s;o far from being the In&s;trument of Ruin to the <HI>French</HI> Na|tion, that they were only ruin'd by your being over-rul'd by tho&s;e <HI>that had an In|fluence as Court at that Time.</HI> If this be true, all his long Blank may be filled up, without any Prejudice to your Character, or without putting any Body in Appre|hen&s;ion either of what you may do, or of what others may project to do by your Means, or by your A&s;&s;i&s;tance among us.</P>
<P>This Book call'd a Letter, gives a long Detail of your Abilities, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'your Skill in Calculations, your being a Man who&s;e Talent and Genius lay particularly in Figures, who had thereby a &s;uperior and uncommon Skill in tho&s;e Games which depend chiefly on Calculation, who had vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and made your Observations of every thing relating to the Management of their Finances.'</Q> And after he has thus &s;et you off, is every Jot as favourable to
<PB N="6" REF="7">
your Projects; intimating, that they were &s;uch as would have &s;upported them&s;elves, and that the Principles on which they were founded were good; that the whole Structure was overthrown by nothing but the exce&s;&s;ive Ri&s;e of the Stock, run up by the ra&s;h and &s;udden Humour of the Peo|ple, not only of <HI>France,</HI> but even of all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> who, in &s;uch prodi|gious Numbers, flock'd at that time to <HI>Paris</HI> to get into them.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, not to flatter you with all the&s;e fine Things, which I humbly pre&s;ume to &s;ay, you know your &s;elf to be fal&s;e; and which you cannot but &s;mile at the reading of, knowing how unfairly, tho' to your Advantage, your Ca&s;e is there &s;tated; give me leave, with all Decency and Re|&s;pect to your Per&s;on, to tell the World that if <HI>Mr.</HI> Law <HI>him&s;elf</HI> was to give a true and genuine Hi&s;tory of him&s;elf, with re|&s;pect to the part which he acted in <HI>France,</HI> it would be quite another way, and he would acknowledge that great part of tho&s;e fine Things which are &s;aid of him in the &s;aid Letter, either are not true in Fact, or ought to have quite another Turn given them, &s;eeing they are &s;et in a wrong Light, and our Eyes are turned from a true to a delu&s;ive Per&s;pective, in our View both of his Conduct and of his De&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Previous to this, Sir, give me leave to &s;ay, that all this which the Letter has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay of Mr. <HI>Law</HI> and of his De|&s;igns, is no more or le&s;s but what may and perhaps with the &s;ame Ju&s;tice be &s;aid of the late Directors of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Com|pany; of whom, &s;ince our Eyes have been open to &s;ome of the &s;ecret Movements of that Affair, we have &s;aid &s;o many gro&s;s Things, and whom we have treated with &s;uch Contempt.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid, nor as I have heard was it ever pretended, that Sir <HI>John Blunt</HI> or the abdicated Mr. <HI>Knight</HI> could imagine, or did &s;uppo&s;e, that ever the Stock of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> could ri&s;e to &s;o &s;urpriz|ing a Height, as by the Avarice and Hu|mour of the People afterwards appear|ed; they have not been charg'd with forming any Schemes upon a &s;uppos'd Ad|vance of &s;uch a Magnitude, nor indeed was it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould; all the Ri&s;e was A&s;toni&s;hment and Surprize: Nor can it be deny'd but that Sir <HI>John Blunt</HI> him|&s;elf pretended to be again&s;t the Advance of the Stock, and was heard in the height of his Pro&s;perity very often to &s;ay, <HI>that the Madne&s;s of the People wou'd ruin them all.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, neither did Mr. <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>France</HI> forbear to make u&s;e of and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
form as great and <HI>if I may &s;ay &s;o</HI> as imprac|ticable Projects upon the Foot of the po|pular Madne&s;s of the People, and per|haps wor&s;e in their Kind than ever Sir <HI>John Blunt</HI> or the Directors form'd here; which Projects, unwieldly in them&s;elves and unable to perform, added their Weight to the Overthrow of Mr. <HI>Law</HI> and his Schemes, when but a minute Accident gave them a Check, even ju&s;t as tho&s;e others did to Sir <HI>John Blunt</HI> and his Schemes, when they received a Shock from a like Accident as the other.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, as this Part may unfold &s;ome Arcana, both in your Management among the <HI>French</HI> Courtiers and in the Management of our C&mdash; among the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Directors, which are not yet fully penetrated by us, no not by &s;ome of tho&s;e who were very nearly con|cerned in them; give me leave to run a &s;hort Parallel between the two Schemes, or rather between the Management re|&s;pectively on either Side, and we &s;hall &s;ee into the Rea&s;on of the Overthrow of both, perhaps farther than we ever &s;aw yet.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Law<HI>'s fir&s;t Step,</HI> &s;ays the Letter, <HI>was to e&s;tabli&s;h a Bank; which receiving and pay|ing con&s;iderable Sums for the Government, lend|ing Money at the low Intere&s;t of</HI> 3 per Cent.
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<HI>di&s;counting Bills, i&s;&s;uing a great Number of Notes payable at Demand, and cau&s;ing tho&s;e Notes to be an&s;wer'd with the utmo&s;t Exact|ne&s;s, rais'd its Credit to &s;uch a height as made its Notes be</HI> 4 <HI>or</HI> 5 per Cent. <HI>better than Specie;</HI> and all the De&s;igns to ruin the Credit of that Bank or its Director, gain'd the highe&s;t Reputation to both.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step Sir <HI>John Blunt</HI> and the Directors of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company took, was to make a Propo&s;al to the Parliament for the paying the Publick Debts of the Na|tion, by ingrafting all the Debts of the Publick into the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock, and en|abling the Government to di&s;charge the Funds, by reducing the Intere&s;t to 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and by yielding to the Government out of the Advance made upon the Stock, a Sum of . . . . Millions in Money in a certain Time.</P>
<P>Had either Mr. <HI>Law</HI> or Sir <HI>John Blunt</HI> contented them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t that they cou'd either expect from the&s;e &s;everal E&s;tabli&s;hments, or &s;o much as be|lieve to be po&s;&s;ible at that Time, they had &s;till retain'd the general Applau&s;e of the Country they were in, and not the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> been forc'd to fly from the Fury of the Rabble, and the <HI>la&s;t</HI> be attainted, &s;ore-faul|ted, confi&s;cated and hated.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
But to go on: Mr. <HI>Law</HI> finding him&s;elf at the Head of a Bank, who&s;e Credit, as above, was 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than Specie, a thing never heard of in <HI>England,</HI> Fate and his working Head pu&s;h'd him upon innumerable Projects, &s;ome of them im|practicable and imaginary, as the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipps;</HI> others of them va&s;t, immen&s;e and unma|nagable, as that of rai&s;ing the general Farms Four Millions a Year, and yet throwing off all the burthen&s;ome Part of the Taxes, and giving them up to the People, &s;uch as the Duties upon Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, Fruit, Wine, and Fuel, taking the Management of the whole Revenue of <HI>France</HI> upon them&s;elves, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing 30000 <HI>Collectors, Toll-Gatherers,</HI> and other Officers who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the Spoils of the People; all which was done not with a real View to be able to &s;upport it by any other Way than the Publick Fame and Credit of the Scheme, for that was im|po&s;&s;ible; but to rai&s;e up the Credit to a &s;tupendious Height, and &s;o to perform, if he really intended to perform, all tho&s;e impo&s;&s;ible Things out of the Plunder of tho&s;e People, who&s;e Avarice dup'd them into &s;uch a Frenzy, as to give 2050 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Shares in his Bubble.</P>
<P>How then can any Man &s;ay that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> oppos'd the Ri&s;ing of Stock? Mr.
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<HI>Law</HI> could not but know that advancing a &s;mall real Value <HI>by Credit,</HI> to a great ima|ginary Value, was the only Way to &s;up|port all tho&s;e va&s;t Undertakings; and that if that Credit la&s;ted, or &s;o long as it la&s;t|ed, tho&s;e Undertakings might be upheld; and therefore it was that he every Day went into &s;ome new Project, broach'd &s;ome new Propo&s;al, however mon&s;trous and impracticable, to keep up the Spirits of the People, which he had rais'd in &s;o &s;ur|prizing a Manner; <HI>&s;uch was</HI> the undertaking Coinage for Nine Years, the Farm of <HI>To|bacco,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, and the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; &s;uch was</HI> the undertaking Eigh|teen Hundred Millions of Publick Debts, and the managing the whole Publick Re|venue; <HI>&s;uch was</HI> erecting Manufactures, making Canals and Navigations, building new Cities, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of the Letter forgets, or perhaps was not enough in the Secret of Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, to mention his grave Re&s;olution to cru&s;h entirely all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks, and &s;ink their Credit; and the &s;everal wi&s;e Mea&s;ures, not to &s;ay cunning Mea&s;ures, he entered into for the per|forming it, and in which he was bit by &s;ome Gentlemen who under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks better than he did; and in which &s;imple Project, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, he
<PB N="12" REF="13">
lo&s;t about One Hundred and Sixty Thou|&s;and Pi&s;toles, which he paid Difference Money: in all which I never &s;aw any of his Craft, except it was in taking Care that <HI>France</HI> &s;hould not hear of it; in which al&s;o he was more beholden to the Mode&s;ty of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen he was concern'd with, who valued their Money enough, but de&s;pis'd the Ga&s;conade of it, than to his own Policy.</P>
<P>Come we back to the long Scene of Ma|nagement in <HI>France,</HI> while the Stock kept up its prodigious Height: How many new Creations of Stock, Fifty Millions at once, did Mr. <HI>Law</HI> crave at a Time, till 300 Mil|lions of New Stock was granted him; all to be &s;old at the mon&s;trous Advance which the Stock then went at?</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, that had 300 Millions of Stock been actually transfer|red and &s;old at the Price which it then was advanc'd to, namely, from 1000 to 2050 <HI>per Cent.</HI> it mu&s;t have enabled Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> not only to have paid off all the Pub|lick Debts, and done all the great Things he had propo&s;ed, but even an hundred Times as many; he might not only have peopled <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> but <HI>America,</HI> and have planted a New World, if he could have found Land to place it on, and the Purcha&s;e of what he had &s;o created could not have
<PB N="13" REF="14">
been paid for by all the Money, Plate and Jewels in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Let us go back to the Directors of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; they, prompted by the &s;ame &s;urprizing Advance upon their Stock, went on in their Degree to innu|merable va&s;t Conceptions: How many Projects and Schemes lay before them? No le&s;s than taking in the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Compa|ny and their Trade, the <HI>African</HI> Compa|ny and their Trade, the <HI>Bank</HI> and their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and at la&s;t all the Cu&s;toms: By their Credit they were to di&s;&s;olve the Tax|es at once, clear the Revenue of all its An|ticipations; they were to advance all the Money the Parliament would have occa|&s;ion to grant, and the World began to think once they would make them&s;elves Parliament, Government, and every Thing: What they might have done, or rather what they might not have done that Way, or what Mr. <HI>Law</HI> might not have done in <HI>France,</HI> had they both gone on, is &s;carce to be expre&s;s'd; but <HI>Na&s;citur ridiculus Mus:</HI> The Parallel goes on &s;till, both were over|turn'd by their own Bulk, the unperform|ing Machines blew them&s;elves up by the Force of their own Motion, and the Pro|jectors are overwhelm'd with them.</P>
<P><HI>So Engineers that &s;pring an ill-charg'd Mine, Sink in the Ruin of their own De&s;ign.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
As Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> to &s;upply the mon&s;trous Demands which he had brought upon his Company, by taking upon them 1800 Millions of Debts, coined every Day new Grants of Stock, which the Humour of the <HI>Me&s;&s;eurs de Quincampoix</HI> early found Chapmen to take off at the mo&s;t prodigi|ous and extravagant Prices; &s;o our Direc|tors form'd, as often as they thought fit, new Sub&s;criptions upon their Stock, to the Tune of 4, 5, or 10 Millions at a Time, and at the prodigious Advance of 300, 400, to 1000 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which the Gentlemen crowd|ing every Day to <HI>Exchange. Alley,</HI> found Means to take off their Hands, at the mo&s;t mon&s;trous and extravagant Prices that they could have the Face to put them up at, and at an Advance beyond it.</P>
<P>They do the Directors of the <HI>South. Sea</HI> Company Inju&s;tice in the highe&s;t Degree, who pretend to &s;ay, that they cou'd not have an&s;wer'd the highe&s;t Dividend that they ever propos'd, and for the longe&s;t Time that it was ever propos'd, namely, 12 Years, had all the Money for which tho&s;e Sub&s;criptions were taken in at, been either paid to them, or &s;ecur'd to be paid to them: And I appeal to the Men of Fi|gures, let them be as partial as they plea&s;e if they are but ju&s;t, to ca&s;t up what a Sub|&s;cription of 5 Millions and a half at 1000
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and 10 Millions at 1200 <HI>per Cent.</HI> as was talk'd of at that time, would not have done? The only Inju&s;tice done by the Directors in making tho&s;e Propo&s;als of Dividends was, that it was evident the&s;e Sub&s;criptions on which they were found|ed, like Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s new Millions of coin'd Stock, could never be paid for; that it was impo&s;&s;ible; and that not all the Mo|ney or Credit of the Nation cou'd per|form it.</P>
<P>And this made the Directors, by a weak and &s;candalous Loan, part with all the Money and Paper they had, to the Tune of 11 Millions, to &s;upport the Circulations of Things in the Town; which as they did no doubt &s;ee, or might have &s;een, could never have been paid; and which yet if they had not done, their Stock could not have held up its Head a Week together.</P>
<P>It may be true, and I believe it would have been true, that if the Company had &s;tood, and had propo&s;ed a fifth Sub&s;crip|tion at 1000, or even at 1200 <HI>per Cent.</HI> it would have been &s;ub&s;crib'd, and 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> or perhaps 200 <HI>per Cent.</HI> would have been paid in; tho' to have done it, the Company mu&s;t not only have i&s;&s;ued all the Money and Bills they had, but all the circulating Ca&s;h, and all the Paper
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Credit of the Nation mu&s;t have been &s;train'd to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t al&s;o have been true, that after the Company had been thus po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the whole Trea&s;ure of the Kingdom, if they had not found &s;ome way or other to have i&s;&s;ued it again every time a new Payment on tho&s;e Sub&s;criptions had been due, tho&s;e Payments cou'd not have been made: The Rea&s;on is plain, that like a Board of Play, when the Box has got all the Money of the Game&s;ters, if it does not think fit to lend it out to them again, the Game is at an End, they can play no more: So tho&s;e Men having thus po&s;&s;e&s;s'd all the Ca&s;h of the Nation, <HI>that is to &s;ay, all that cou'd be come at,</HI> all that was to be had, and all the Credit al&s;o that the Men of Credit were able to an&s;wer; if they did not think fit to i&s;&s;ue it again on &s;ome foot or other, <HI>the Play would have been at an End,</HI> no Men could have made good their Payments, and all &s;orts of Confu&s;ion would have follow'd.</P>
<P>This was exactly parallel to Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Ca&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> who likewi&s;e made a Di|vidend upon his Stock when it was about 1000 <HI>per Cent.</HI> intimating, that he was able to do the like in proportion to any Advance which the Stock might have been rais'd to, as doubtle&s;s he wou'd have
<PB N="17" REF="18">
done, had all the Stock which he daily created been purcha&s;ed at the advanc'd Price which it was current at when created and paid for too: for what might not he do, who could create Fifty or an Hundred Millions of Stock when he plea&s;ed, and &s;ell it immediately at 2000 <HI>per Cent?</HI> All the Difficulty was, that in|deed he might while the Humour of the People la&s;ted, &s;ell his Stock at that Price, but that all the Wealth of <HI>Europe</HI> could not pay for it; and &s;o, as I &s;aid before, the Machine bur&s;t it &s;elf by its own Weight and the Violence of its own Motion.</P>
<P>And &s;hall any Man come now and compliment you (Mr. <HI>Law</HI>) with telling the World how equal your Genius is to the va&s;t De&s;igns you had laid: and that it was only your being over-rul'd by tho&s;e who had an Influence at Court that over|threw it all?</P>
<P>To be plain, Sir, and not to injure Truth or you &s;o much, the Ca&s;e was only this, that tho&s;e People who had the In|fluence at Court, finding that you had laid Schemes too large for the whole Trea|&s;ure of the World to an&s;wer, and that you only &s;crew'd up the adventurous Hu|mour of the People by &s;tarting every Day new Surprizes, new Oceans for them to launch out into; &s;o &s;upporting one Chimera by another, building Infinite op|on
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Infinite, which it was evident mu&s;t &s;ink all at la&s;t into infinite Confu&s;ion; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> &s;eeing this, they thought fit to give a Check to the Velocity of the Motion, in hopes to have let Things fall gently and gradually. But the Machine being unweildy, and all the Parts depending up|the Progre&s;&s;ion of the foremo&s;t, like a &s;trong Current ha&s;tily and effectually &s;top'd, the Waters at the fir&s;t Check over|flow'd all the Country round them; and &s;till not able to find a Vent forward, re|verted with an Ebb, a thou&s;and Times more &s;urious than the Flux which fir&s;t brought them on; and it was then no wonder that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> could not &s;tand it; 'twas really more a Wonder that tho&s;e Great Men, who&s;e Act and Deed that Ca|ta&s;trophe was, had Power left to carry him off <HI>as they did.</HI> And I believe, Sir, you are the fir&s;t Man that ever came clear off, if you may think your &s;elf &s;afe from the Re&s;entment of a whole Nation, and with &s;o much of the Ruins of their Coun|try in his Pocket.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t thus, Sir, has it been here in its Kind. Happy had it been if the Great Per&s;ons concern'd here, of whom Sir <HI>John Blunt</HI> and his Fraternity have been little more than the Shadow, had <HI>as much in time</HI> and from the &s;ame Principle of Concern for the publick Good, put a check to the
<PB N="19" REF="20">
mon&s;trous Growth of Things which they could not but fore&s;ee, and <HI>Mr.</HI> Ai&s;labie <HI>tells us,</HI> he did fore&s;ee, would at la&s;t blow up and end in Confu&s;ion and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, they went on to the la&s;t Ga&s;p, till they were overwhelm'd by their own Folly, and by that Envy which was only the blinded Child of unbounded Avarice and Ambition, as I &s;hall &s;hew pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Fall of your Machine I have touch'd at already; the Author of the Letter &s;eems not at all to &s;ee the Nature of it, and is quite wide of the Occa&s;ion; and hinting only at the In&s;truments, as if they were &s;carce known, in which, by the way, he is al&s;o mi&s;taken, places it to the account of a mere Trifle, namely, that the fir&s;t Adven|turers began to think of <HI>realizing their Stock,</HI> and converting the prodigious Gains they had made into Specie. And this, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> brought &s;uch a Demand upon the Bank as it was impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>How poor and mean a De&s;cription is here of the mo&s;t flagrant Cheat in the World, and which was ju&s;t then offer'd in the Face of the Sun! the like of which was enough to alarm all the World. The meaning of it all was, <HI>in &s;hort, nothing more or le&s;s than this,</HI> that the Great Men who were fir&s;t in this mon&s;trous Adven|ture

of yours, and who had, as you &s;ay, come in at 60 <HI>per Cent.</HI> under Par, and &s;tood now at 2000 <HI>per Cent.</HI> above Par, know|ing very well that it was, <HI>as above,</HI> im|po&s;&s;ible to be &s;upported, but mu&s;t at la&s;t fall all to pieces and come to nothing, be|gan to think it high time to be &s;atisfy'd, <HI>and &s;ell out,</HI> ve&s;ting their va&s;t Stocks in the Bank; and from thence, as you &s;ay, drawing &s;uch great Sums in Specie, that it was impo&s;&s;ible the Bank or even the whole Kingdom &s;hould an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>This was indeed done with le&s;s Art than in <HI>England;</HI> it was immediately &s;een in the <HI>Rue de Quincampoix,</HI> that the Great Men, and particularly the fir&s;t Pro|jectors, began to &s;ell out their Stock, and buy E&s;tates; nay, the great Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> on who&s;e Example &s;o much depended, was not &s;o politick in this part as Sir <HI>John Blant.</HI> but bought E&s;tates, Lord&s;hips, Palaces, nay, as I have heard, even Roy alties and Principalities; I hope no Man will place that part among his Prudentials, or as a Te&s;timony of his mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Genius. If Mr. <HI>Law</HI> did not fore&s;ee that his &s;elling our, and the other Peoples &s;el|ling out, who were look'd upon to be in the main Secret of the Affair, would at lea&s;t he an Example to others to do the like; and that the Alarm once taken, it would &s;oon
<PB N="21" REF="22">
bring more Sellers to Market than Buy|ers, the Con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be a Fall of the Price, which would be fatal as Death; I &s;ay, if he did not fore&s;ee this, he could not be the Great Man the World at that Time e&s;teem'd him to be; and if he did fore&s;ee it, and yet openly acted &s;o, he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ee him&s;elf at the End of the Adventure, and, like a skil|ful Pilot, who &s;eeing fir&s;t the unavoidable Wreck of the Ship he is in, makes Provi|&s;ion for his own Safety, and takes care to get &s;omething too out of the Cargo for him&s;elf. But neither of the&s;e Suppo&s;itions give us any Idea of Mr. <HI>Law</HI> to his Advan|tage, whether we &s;peak of his Capacity or of his Integrity.</P>
<P>Come we then to the <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> which overthrew our <HI>South-Sea</HI> Fabrick here, which are in Proportion the &s;ame: That which gave them the fir&s;t Blow was like|wi&s;e a Trifle, and from which even the longe&s;t Head among them did not expect the Con&s;equence that happen'd; nay, it was &s;een without Doors before it was &s;een within, if we may believe &s;ome who were Witne&s;&s;es to the Surprize it was, even to tho&s;e who &s;truck the Blow, when they found the Wound was felt where it was not intended. The Ca&s;e was this.</P>
<P>Avarice, an unwearied and impatient
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Vice, finding the Scheme on which her great Advantages were built, rival'd, <HI>as it was then call'd,</HI> by petty Bubbles of ri|&s;ing Fame, and not brooking any &s;uch Thing as to &s;ee Part of the Gain going be&s;ides her Mill, grown in&s;olent by her Succe&s;s, and gra&s;ping the whole World in her Imagination, &s;he grew al&s;o unea&s;y at their Succe&s;s; and though &s;he &s;oar'd infinitely above them all, ought to have di&s;dain'd them; or that <HI>being her &s;elf a Bubble,</HI> &s;he ought to have encourag'd the univer&s;al Humour of Bubbling: I &s;ay, Avarice, impatient thus to be mated or &s;o much as rival'd, &s;tir'd up her old Ance|&s;tor, <HI>Envy,</HI> to fall upon them; and, in a Word, to make u&s;e of her Friends to &s;up|pre&s;s all the other Bubbles of the Town.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this Project came out a Publication, and Proce&s;s was order'd to be i&s;&s;ued out by Writ of <HI>Scire Facias</HI> again&s;t &s;everal of the Projects that were then on Foot, &s;uch as <HI>York-Buildings, Bri|ti&s;h Copper, Welch Copper, Lu&s;tring,</HI> and others; and the two Companies &s;ince cal|led the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> and the <HI>London A&s;&s;urances,</HI> were threaten'd with the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But the Influence of this De&s;ign run quite counter to what was intended, and Things began pre&s;ently to take ano|ther Turn; for as this immediately &s;truck
<PB N="23" REF="24">
a mortal Blow upon the Stocks of all tho&s;e Companies, which were already very high, and that a prodigious Number of Con|tracts were made for thier Stock, and af|terwards became void by their never be|ing able to open their Books; the People were immediately oblig'd to &s;ell off their <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock to &s;upport their Credit, which had receiv'd &s;uch a Blow in the&s;e Bubbles.</P>
<P>But it did not end here. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. This brought &s;uch a prodigious Quan|tity of Stock to Market that it was impo&s;|&s;ible Buyers &s;hould be found to take it off; which, as it always is when there are more Sellers than Buyers, made Stock im|mediately fall; and which was &s;till wor&s;e,</P>
<P N="2">2. It check'd the adventurous Humour of the People, gave them a Shock, made them &s;ick of Bubbles in general, and made them &s;ugge&s;t that the <HI>South-Sea</HI> it &s;elf, being by the extravagant Greatne&s;s become a Bubble al&s;o, might, &s;ome time or other, meet with a like Shock; and thus withdrawing univer&s;ally from every Thing, the Cata&s;trophe began, and has ever &s;ince gone on to what we &s;ee it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>All this while, as was afterwards di&s;|covered, the Great Men who were in the
<PB N="24" REF="25">
Secret, who knew that one time or other it mu&s;t all blow up, were like your Great Men in <HI>France, realizing their Stock;</HI> that is to &s;ay, turning it into Specie, and buying E&s;tates with it, for which they gave mo&s;t extravagant Rates, &s;uch as the Sellers al|mo&s;t blu&s;h'd to ask for them, paying for them as much as po&s;&s;ibly they could in <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock, &s;o to cover the Transfer|ring &s;uch large Sums of Stock the better.</P>
<P>Now all the Difference between Mr. <HI>Law</HI> and the Great Men in <HI>France,</HI> and the Directors in <HI>England</HI> was, that he did it openly and unwarily, and thereby gave the Alarm which overthrew their whole Scheme; but our People did it &s;ubtily and privately; and that our Alarm coming another way, as above, they were not found out till afterward.</P>
<P>And thus I have run a Parallel between the two Schemes, and the Management on either Side, as far as it concerns Mr. <HI>Law;</HI> in which I think I do Mr. <HI>Law</HI> no Injury, if I &s;ay, that the Letter Writer has made a wide Deviation from his true Character; and that tho' his Genius was really very much bent upon Figures and Calculations, and that he had at fir&s;t ju&s;t Notions of Credit and Ca&s;h, and of form|ing Projections for the carrying tho&s;e Un|dertakings which related to a Bank, yet
<PB N="25" REF="26">
he was bold, enterprizing, ra&s;h, and ad|venturous beyond the Reach of the Plan on which he propo&s;ed to act; that he at|tempted impracticable Things, and &s;up|ported them by launching into more Things equally impracticable; &s;o that there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for him at la&s;t <HI>to &s;ink,</HI> as I have &s;aid, <HI>in the Ruins of his own De&s;ign;</HI> that finding this Nece&s;&s;ity ap|proaching and inevitable he <HI>&s;old out,</HI> and ama&s;&s;ed an infinite Trea&s;ure in Specie, Part of which he remitted, that is convey|ed out of the Kingdom, and with other Parts of which he purcha&s;ed Palaces, E|&s;tates, Honours and Lands without Num|ber; and when in the Con&s;equence of this the People began to be alarm'd, and did the like, and that the Bank &s;top'd, the Stock &s;unk, and all fell into Confu&s;ion; he got leave to run away to avoid the ju&s;t Re&s;entment of a ruin'd Nation.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I appeal to your &s;elf, whether this is not a fairer Account of the Fact, and a truer Hi&s;tory of Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> than what the Letter has undertaken, or than what he has introduced as from <HI>Pa|ris;</HI> and that tho' you are not flatter'd, no Injury is done you in it, nor any Hurt in|tended you.</P>
<P>It remains now to enquire here with the &s;ame Plainne&s;s into what the Writer of
<PB N="26" REF="27">
the Letter would only &s;ugge&s;t, whether maliciou&s;ly or not I will not determine; namely, that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> being arrived here, <HI>all the&s;e Things</HI> may be the Con&s;equence of his coming hither; which ought to be written down in the four Lines which he has left Blank in his Letter, intimating, <HI>if we plea&s;e to take it &s;o, for he leaves every one to take it as he will,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> may be employ'd on great De&s;igns here among us, <HI>whether to good or hurt he'd likewi&s;e leave us to conjecture.</HI></P>
<P>This I mu&s;t needs &s;ay I think is doing you a great deal of Injury, and expo&s;ing you to very great Hard&s;hips and Re&s;ent|ments one way or other, as People may be prompted by their Fears or Hopes to &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>Now in this, Sir, I may perhaps do you an unexpected Piece of Ju&s;tice, and am not out of Hopes of meriting much of your Favour by it; at lea&s;t I will under|take to deliver Mr. <HI>Law</HI> from all the Pre|judices and Jealou&s;ies which &s;eem to be ri&s;ing again&s;t him among us: and this you will be further &s;atisfy'd of in the reading the&s;e Sheets; wherein, if I effec|tually make it appear that all that is &s;ug|ge&s;ted of Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> as to what he may do here, is groundle&s;s, and that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble that he &s;hould ever be able to do ei|ther
<PB N="27" REF="28">
good <HI>for us</HI> or hurt <HI>to us;</HI> I &s;hall, <HI>Tout de une Coup,</HI> remove all the Jealou&s;ies and ill Will that I &s;ee &s;ome People begin to entertain of him; and tho' it may be &s;ugge&s;ted that then I &s;hall <HI>vote him u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> which they &s;ay is indeed making him a meer Invalid, and be&s;peaking a Cell for him at <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> or at <HI>Greenwich;</HI> yet <HI>I &s;ay</HI> I &s;hall make him full Amends by deli|vering him from the Clamours of the People, and &s;toping the Mouths of the&s;e &s;peech-making Enemies, which he might otherwi&s;e find very trouble&s;ome to him on all Occa&s;ions, making his Native Country a true <HI>A&s;&s;ylum</HI> to him, as it is to a great many harmle&s;s, worthle&s;s Gentlemen be|&s;ide.</P>
<P>Nor is there here any need to enter in|to Arguments from your good Character, and the general Principle which your Friends &s;ay you have acted by, and &s;o en|deavour to prove that you will do us no harm, &s;ince I have that more &s;olid Argu|ment to make u&s;e of, namely, the Repu|tation of your Sen&s;e, your Under&s;tanding and Penetration; for having once laid it down as a Fundamental, and prov'd it pa&s;t Contradiction, that it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould do either good or hurt to us, I leave your Character of a Man of Sen&s;e and Judgment to vouch for you that you will
<PB N="28" REF="29">
not attempt it; and it would be the greate&s;t Satyr imaginable upon Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> and an Affront which my Regard for him will not &s;uffer me to offer him, to in|&s;inuate, that he will venture to embark in any thing which his Under&s;tanding mu&s;t tell him is impo&s;&s;ible. We are a Nation credulous enough, and have been cen&s;ur'd for our Folly in the Conduct of our pri|vate Affairs, by all the wi&s;er People of <HI>Europe,</HI> and our late <HI>South-Sea</HI> Follies give but too much Rea&s;on for us to acknow|ledge that the Reproach is ju&s;t; and had the great Mr. <HI>Law</HI> acted in the Place of the le&s;s politick Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> or the &s;till le&s;s able Mr. <HI>C&mdash;g,</HI> I know not to what farther Extremes we might have run.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that in the height of our jobbing Madne&s;s, many People as a|maz'd and &s;urpriz'd, would frequently &s;tart a little and offer the idle Que&s;tion, <HI>Where will all the&s;e Things end?</HI> But there was not a Man that did, or perhaps dur&s;t boldly take Pen and Ink, and &s;hew by ju&s;t Calculations where they MUST end, and what De&s;truction attended them; and of which it might have <HI>even then</HI> been &s;aid they were not only po&s;&s;ible to be the Con&s;equences, but that it was impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e: I &s;ay, no Body dur&s;t be

&s;o free and hone&s;t, for he was &s;ure to be run down by the popular Rage of the Day on one hand, and check'd, perhaps in&s;ulted by Power on the other Hand; nor do I &s;ay thus much without good Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>But had any of tho&s;e wi&s;e Men, who <HI>like Prophets that prophecy after a Thing is come to pa&s;s, have &s;ince &s;hewn us how im|po&s;&s;ible it was tho&s;e Things &s;hould end other|wi&s;e than they did,</HI> had Zeal enough for their Country's Good, and to have adven|tured to &s;ay as much and with as clear Demon&s;trations of it before-hand as they did afterward, however they might have been treated <HI>then,</HI> they would have ob|tain'd a double &s;hare of Reputation <HI>now,</HI> as well for their Hone&s;ty as their Pene|tration.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t take Things as they are, and as Nature pre&s;ents them to us. Fate and our National Precipitations deter|min'd us at that Time to be a Prey to our Deluders, and which is wor&s;e to be the <HI>Fools</HI> of <HI>Fools;</HI> for really the Managers, however by the In&s;atuation of the Times they prevail'd to impo&s;e upon us to &s;uch a Degree, yet it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd us'd no great Cunning in deceiving us: The Baits were laid &s;o &s;uperficially, and the Hook appeared &s;o open, that had we not
<PB N="30" REF="31">
been blinded by a voracious Avarice, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to have brought a whole Nation to be plundered as they were, even running into the Pit with their Eyes open.</P>
<P>It is reported that a certain Fi&s;h, which we deal much in Abroad, is &s;o eager for the Prey, that if a Hook be but cover'd with a bit of red Cloth in&s;tead of Fle&s;h, they &s;wallow it all at once, and are ta|ken without any Bait at all; we were in|deed taken in tho&s;e Days without a Bait; we were a Temptation to our &s;elves, our own Avarice led us on, and we came to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Hou&s;e &s;o eager to be un|done, that there was no need to lay Traps and Plots to deceive us.</P>
<P>The U&s;e I make of this, for I am not entring into the Hi&s;tory of it, is not to &s;how how mad we were then, but to &s;how how &s;en&s;ible we are of it now, and to let you &s;ee, Sir, that the Train being now fir'd and blown up, there is no need to fear we &s;hall a &s;econd Time be drawn in: That we can no more be Bubble-riden; that we &s;hall not bite at a <HI>red Rag</HI> now; and if all the Men of Figures, and Men of Art in <HI>Europe</HI> were to Angle for us, they would catch no more <HI>Guageons</HI> here; the Sea&s;on is over; the Moon-blind People are effectually cur'd, the Frenzy is aba|ted;
<PB N="31" REF="32">
not the &s;harpe&s;t Jobber of the Town can reach us, or over-reach us now, no not the great Mr. <HI>Law;</HI> if he thinks he can, he may go to work when he plea&s;es; but he will &s;oon &s;ee his Engines will not work; the Sea&s;on for National Delu&s;ion is over: He may as well rai&s;e a Harve&s;t in Winter, as rai&s;e the adventurous Tem|per again among the People, after the Shocks and Damps to their Courage which they have lately receiv'd: As the adven|turing Temper of the People is check'd, and the Edge of their Courage that Way taken off, &s;o Mr. <HI>Law</HI> mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay, and lay a great Stre&s;s upon it too, that the Tools to work with on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions, I mean <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Credit.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Law</HI> was certainly right in his Po&s;|tulata, which the Letter to him &s;ays to his Prai&s;e, <HI>p.</HI> 19. were the Principles which he went upon in his great Under|taking, namely,<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>That Trade depended on Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That Credit was equal to Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Credit of the Royal Bank, &s;upported by the Whole Species of all, and form'd into one <HI>Great Trading Com|pany,</HI> had infinite Advantage over Cre|dit, in the Hands of private Traders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That con&s;equently &s;uch Credit might be extended much farther than private Per&s;onal Credit.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="32" REF="33">
That Paper might &s;upply the Place of Silver, and was even better quali|fy'd to be us'd as Money.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>I &s;ay, the&s;e are all &s;olid and undoubted Axioms in the Affairs of Trade or Re|venues, Funds, National Trea&s;ure, and &s;uch like Things, and are worthy of the Ge|nius of the Great Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> when acting in <HI>France,</HI> where Credit never &s;hew'd much of her Face before; <HI>tho' here,</HI> with your Pardon, <HI>the&s;e Things are common To|picks that every Stock-Jobber is Ma&s;ter of.</HI></P>
<P>But what is all this to be talk'd of now? And I wonder that the Letter Writer cou'd mention them, after what he had &s;aid, <HI>p.</HI> 6. of the deplorable Con|dition of our Native Country: <HI>See his Words;</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You will find our Trade lo&s;t, our Credit ruin'd, our Money in the Hands of the ba&s;e&s;t Men among us, and the Innocent and Deluded &s;till groaning un|der the Oppre&s;&s;ions of the Wicked and In&s;atiable&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, after this, is it not a mo&s;t prepo&s;terous Thing, an Ab&s;urdity, and merits Ridicule to the highe&s;t Degree, to hear the &s;ame Writer talk of any Danger from Mr. <HI>Law?</HI> What can be more incon|&s;i&s;tent? Mr. <HI>Law</HI> indeed laid down the great and undoubted Particulars above as
<PB N="33" REF="34">
compleat Propo&s;itions, and he was right; and upon the&s;e he founded all the great Things he did in <HI>France: For Example,</HI> he &s;et up a Bank, ama&s;&s;ed Money, and e|rected Credit; on the&s;e Three what might he not do, and much greater Things he might have done, if his Genius, which this Man extols &s;o much, had been equal to his Undertaking.</P>
<P>But what is this to his &s;etting his Wheels to work among us, who this Man &s;ays, have neither Trade, Money, or Credit? If the be&s;t Engineer, or Mill|wright in the Nation were to build a Water-mill, and make it a mo&s;t beautiful compleat Piece of Work that ever was &s;een, yet if he has no Water to drive it, 'tis a Thing without Life, u&s;ele&s;s and fit for nothing. For Mr. <HI>Law</HI> to &s;et his Wit to work upon a Scheme of Credit may be a fine Thing, and I am ready to do Mr. <HI>Law</HI> Ju&s;tice with my utmo&s;t Skill; but what can this do among us, who&s;e Cre|dit is ruin'd? Do Game&s;ters invite People to play that have no Bank? or do Mer|chants invite Men to buy that have no Credit?</P>
<P>Again, as we have no Credit, &s;o we have no Money; and what have we to fear being cheated of, who have nothing to lo&s;e?</P>
<Q><PB N="34" REF="35">
Contabit vacuus coram latrone viator.</Q>
<P>If we had a flowing Ca&s;h and a high Credit, we might indeed be jealous of a Man &s;am'd for an extraordinary Genius; which I take to be only fine Words for &s;omething el&s;e, and a mannerly way of calling a Gentleman a Bite and a Sharper, which I &s;hall not imitate. I &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Law</HI> may be all that this Gentleman &s;ays of him, tho' I &s;hall not &s;ay I believe it of him: But if Mr. <HI>Law</HI> was &s;harper than he and Forty more as cunning as him&s;elf, they could never rai&s;e a Project to the hurt of tho&s;e People who have neither Money or Credit.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Law</HI> will &s;et up the fine&s;t Pro|ject in the World upon a Foundation of Nothing, we will come all into it, and bring Nothing to his Nothing; and let him &s;ee what he will make of us; there can be no Danger on our Side.</P>
<P>I remember an old Ver&s;e of a Gentle|man, who having lo&s;t what he had at Play, li&s;ted him&s;elf for a Soldier; and his Friends per&s;wading him again&s;t it, and telling him of the Danger, he wrote this to them in An&s;wer;<Q><PB N="35" REF="36">
What cares he to die, Sir, that can't tell how to live?</Q></P>
<P>I turn the Ca&s;e to the Point in hand: Projects are a Game; let Mr. <HI>Law</HI> &s;et up as many as he plea&s;es, we may all come into them. For,<Q>What care they to Game, Sir, who nothing have to lo&s;e?</Q> This is argued upon the Author's own Hy|pothe&s;is, namely, that our Trade is lo&s;t, our Money gone, our Credit ruin'd; if this be true, what can Mr. <HI>Law</HI> make of us? what can he get by us? So we may effectually clear him of having any De&s;ign upon tho&s;e of whom nothing is to be gotten.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t it &s;hould be &s;ugge&s;ted that this is only catching at the Advantage given in Argument, but has no &s;olid Weight in it, for that the A&s;&s;umption may be denied; and 'tis apparent we have both Trade and Money, and Credit, though not much of the latter.</P>
<P>To come then to the other &s;ide of the Propo&s;ition, and prove, that as he will not attempt us, becau&s;e nothing is to be got by us, &s;o he cannot hurt us if he
<PB N="36" REF="37">
&s;hould attempt it, becau&s;e our Eyes are now open; we are the burnt Children who &s;hall always dread the Fire; we have been bit once, and it was our Ma|&s;ters the * * * *, and our Ma&s;ters the * * * * *, and our Ma&s;ters the * * * * * 's Fault; but if we are bit again it will be our own Faults and no Body's el&s;e. And on this Account only I am far from being of their Opinion, and would have none be jealous of Mr. <HI>Law.</HI> I &s;ay, let Mr. <HI>Law</HI> go to work, and if he has not &s;pent all his Ammunition in <HI>France,</HI> and export|ed all his Policy, and exhau&s;ted his calcu|lating Genius there; let him try his Hand among us, let him go to work with us, and &s;ee what he can make of it and wel|come. I &s;ay, that what between tho&s;e who have no Money to lo&s;e, and tho&s;e who having lo&s;t &s;o much are made too cunning to lo&s;e any more, we have no|thing to fear from Mr. <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, and to conclude all: Here are no Materials for Mr. <HI>Law</HI> to work with; here are no more Funds to bring in; as there are no more Fools to &s;ub|&s;cribe them, &s;o there are no Things for them to &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>
<P>It is true that our Credit has &s;uffered a Blow, a deep Wound, tho' I hope not a mortal Wound: On the other Hand, it
<PB N="37" REF="38">
is not to be reviv'd by any Project, I &s;ay not by any; the whole World cannot re|&s;tore Credit in <HI>England</HI> to what it has been; but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the One Article call'd Time, which does not con|&s;i&s;t with any Company's <HI>d'Eclas,</HI> either Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> or any Man in the World can bring forth.</P>
<P>Our Credit has been lo&s;t by Knavery, by Tricking and fal&s;e Dealing; and nothing but the Rever&s;e of the Chicane, which is Hone&s;ty, can re&s;tore it: and this Ho|ne&s;ty mu&s;t be approv'd to be the prevail|ing general Practice of the Age as the o|ther has been, before it can introduce Credit. Hone&s;ty and Credit went away together, and they mu&s;t come together or not at all; the Allu&s;ion will be found to be ju&s;t, and the Con&s;equence is plain, that till by Length of Time we recover our Hone&s;ty of Dealing, we &s;hall never fully re&s;tore our Credit; and till Credit is re&s;tor'd, there's no Foundation for a Man of Genius to build upon, to do us or him|&s;elf any Good; and I take Mr. <HI>Law</HI> to be too wi&s;e a Man to pretend to form any new Undertaking here, as both we and him&s;elf are now circum&s;tanc'd in the World.</P>
