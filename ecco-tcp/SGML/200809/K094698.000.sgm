<PB N="3" REF="5">length of time we have been in it; another conclu&s;ion is, that not knowing the paths we have come, we know not where we are&mdash;I know only that we are in a clo&s;e walk of trees with hou&s;es at a di&s;tance; we may be among&s;t people, who pay no regard to genius, &s;cience, or inven|tion, but may put us all to death, taking us for three witches that ride in the air.</P>
