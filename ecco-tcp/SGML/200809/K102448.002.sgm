<HEAD>NUMB. LXVI. <HI>Saturday, May</HI> 1.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE never has been a period in which greater preten&s;ions were made to patrioti&s;m than in the pre&s;ent, though perhaps there never was a pe|riod in which public &s;pirit was &s;o utter|ly di&s;regarded. Every man we meet has &s;omething to &s;ay about the &s;ufferings of his unfortunate country, though at that very moment he is doing every thing in his power to prejudice this unfor|nate country him&s;elf. In the cour&s;e of my ac|quaintance I have known a man exclaim again&s;t luxury, who could not make a dinner without twelve or fourteen di&s;hes; and have heard a woman of fa&s;hion commi&s;erating the ca&s;e of our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed manufactures, with the very &s;ame
<PB N="2" REF="11">
breath that gave orders for the purcha&s;e of a French &s;ilk, a &s;et of Dre&s;den di&s;hes, or an Indian cabinet. Contradiction is the prevailing foible of the pre&s;ent age; and in nothing are we more un|accountable, than in our eternal preten&s;ions to con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t whim&s;ical patriot, however, whom I have met with, is Ned Scamper. This extraor|dinary character has &s;tudied the celebrated fable of the bees with the clo&s;e&s;t attention, and puts down every vice or folly which he commits to the good of his country. If he gets intoxicated, it is from a &s;pirit of genuine patrioti&s;m. The national revenue is benefited in proportioned to the quan|tity he con&s;umes: and if he breaks the head of an unfortunate waiter, that's another in&s;tance of public &s;pirit. The money which he gives to make the affair up, circulates through the community, and is a cau&s;e of &s;atisfaction to a thou&s;and families. In &s;hort, Ned has drank, wenched, fought, and beggared him&s;elf, through an exalted &s;olicitude for the general emolument, and is now clo&s;e pent up in one of our pri&s;ons, out of a pure and di&s;in|tere&s;ted regard for the welfare of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>YET notwith&s;tanding the little claim which the generality of this kingdom can really have to the character of patrioti&s;m, it mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be acknowledged, that we have &s;ome people, who in oppo&s;ition to the torrent of fa&s;hionable folly, con&s;ume &s;carcely any thing but the produce of their own country. To be &s;ure the&s;e people cut
<PB N="3" REF="12">
but a very moderate figure in life; they &s;eldom ri&s;e beyond the level of oy&s;ter women, common &s;oldiers, hackney coachmen, or bricklayers' labou|rers: but what then, both their beer and their gin are manufactured within the weekly bills; and if their tobacco is not the immediate growth of Great Britain, it is at lea&s;t &s;ent us from &s;ome of the Briti&s;h plantations. Nay their very oaths are en|tirely of Engli&s;h materials &mdash; no <HI>'Pon my honours</HI>&mdash; or <HI>let me dies,</HI> and &s;uch like de&s;picable exclamations of foreign contexture; but a &s;olid <HI>b &mdash; t my l &mdash; s,</HI> like a humming tankard of <HI>Calvert's entire butt,</HI> &s;trkes us at once with admiration, and gives an equal proof both of their public &s;pirit and under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that though the&s;e people are the be&s;t friends to the real intere&s;t of their country, they neverthele&s;s give them&s;elves no airs of im|portance, nor run into any in&s;olent &s;elf-&s;ufficiencies about their attachment to the good of the kingdom. On the contrary, they leave every arrogance of this nature to their &s;uperiors who act upon prin|ciples diametrically oppo&s;ite; from which we may naturally infer, that tho&s;e are always the true&s;t patriots who make the lea&s;t demands upon our gratitude for prai&s;e; and who pur&s;ue the indeviable path of national welfare, without looking upon them&s;elves as entitled to any extraordinary merit from the &s;teadine&s;s of their cour&s;e. It is al&s;o worthy of ob&s;ervation that the lower the &s;ituation of the Briti&s;h Plebeian, the more inflexibly rivetted
<PB N="4" REF="13">
we find him to the good of his country; the more we &s;ee him wedded to his gin and tobacco; while on the contrary, the higher we go among con&s;e|quence and coronets, the higher encouragement we &s;hall find given to every thing of a foreign ma|nufacture, and the higher we &s;hall find the no&s;tril of contempt turned up at the produce of poor old England.</P>
<P>IT may po&s;&s;ibly be ob&s;erved on this occa&s;ion, that notwith&s;tanding this great &s;uperiority which I give the lowe&s;t ranks over the very fir&s;t; yet if an enquiry was made into the principles of each, both might appear to bear a nearer &s;imilitude at bottom, than at pre&s;ent I &s;eem inclinable to allow. It may po&s;&s;ibly be urged, that if the poore&s;t orders of the people were able to furni&s;h them&s;elves with the luxuries of life, they would run into ju&s;t the &s;ame exce&s;&s;es for which they are continually railing at their betters; and manife&s;t as little regard for the welfare of their country, as the mo&s;t fa&s;hiona|ble man of quality in the kingdom. Why in fact, I believe they would; but this proves nothing more, than that, with all our patriotic boa&s;ting, we have not a &s;ingle &s;park of public &s;pirit ex|i&s;ting among&s;t us as a nation; and that with all our ridiculous parade of free-born Engli&s;hmen, we are the verie&s;t &s;laves in the univer&s;e to the wor&s;t of tyrants &mdash; vice and affectation.</P>
<P>THE only way to recover our liberty from the oppre&s;&s;ive fangs of &s;uch arbitrary rulers, is to make a proper u&s;e of our under&s;tand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng. &mdash;
<PB N="5" REF="14">
We do not want either &s;pirit or good-&s;en&s;e; yet through &s;ome unaccountable impul&s;e, we act as if utterly de&s;titute of both. &mdash; We can ridicule our follies, and be a&s;hamed of our vices, yet never make the lea&s;t effort to get the better of either; and there is &s;carcely a road to virtue but what we have the ju&s;tice to admire, at the very in&s;tant we are giving the mo&s;t unbounded loo&s;e to licentiou&s;|ne&s;s and immorality. With regard, however, to actions of a public kind, there is a patrioti&s;m of the mo&s;t exalted nature, with which we have hitherto appeared totally unacquainted, notwith|&s;tanding it is of infinitely greater importance than the encouragement of commerce or manufactures. This patrioti&s;m is the practice of moral rectitude, and the de&s;ire of &s;etting a good example to our neighbours. Now-a-days, if a legislator delivers a popular harangue in either hou&s;e of parliament, we &s;et him down as the <HI>deliciae humani generis</HI>; and upon the mere &s;trength of this &s;ingle qualification, give him an indubitable privilege to trample upon every law both of rea&s;on and morality. If he exerts him&s;elf in a &s;trenuous oppo&s;ition to Go|vernment, we are regardle&s;s how many worthy trade&s;men he breaks by his di&s;hone&s;ty, and laugh at a violation of our wife and our daughters, where the ruffian happens to profe&s;s a real regard for the intere&s;t of his country. By this means we reconcile the white&s;t virtue with the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite vice; and imagine it po&s;&s;ible, that a man can have the highe&s;t veneration imaginable for our rights
<PB N="6" REF="15">
and liberties, when he is bur&s;ting through the mo&s;t &s;acred of them all.</P>
<P>LET us, however, be a&s;&s;ured, that a bad man never made a real patriot. He that is in&s;en&s;ible of what he owes to his Deity and to him&s;elf, can never be con&s;cious of what is due to his country. The foundation of all public excellence is in pri|vate virtue; and where we find that wanting, though a combination of &s;ome peculiar circum|&s;tances may engage a great per&s;onage to &s;upport the intere&s;t of his country, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that he is actuated by motives very different to the principles of patrioti&s;m; and that he only makes u&s;e of the fa&s;cinating &s;ound to cloak the purpo&s;es of di&s;appointed pride, and &s;ecret re&s;entment. Where a man truly loves his country, he is tender of its minute&s;t laws, and pays an equal regard to the morals, as he does to the temporal intere&s;ts, of the public.</P>

<HEAD>NUMB. LXVII. <HI>Saturday, May</HI> 8.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I have more than once con|demned the practice of toa&s;ting as a cu&s;tom diametrically oppo&s;ite to every principle both of rea&s;on and politene&s;s, there is, however, one &s;pe|cies of it which has yet e&s;caped my animadver&s;ion, though perhaps none of the lea&s;t culpable: I in|tend therefore to make it the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent
<PB N="7" REF="16">
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and flatter my&s;elf that it will prove no way di&s;agreeable to my readers.</P>
<P>WHEN the fa&s;hion of toa&s;ting was fir&s;t of all in&s;tituted, is by no means a nece&s;&s;ary object of enquiry; but had it been judiciou&s;ly confined to the limits of a tavern, and kept &s;acred for the pur|po&s;es of midnight riot, it would be infinitely le&s;s entitled to our cen&s;ure and contempt. The wild and giddy headed hour of extravagance might pro|bably palliate a ca&s;ual gu&s;t of folly and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s; but when in open violation of all the dicta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of decency, it is carried into private families, the lea&s;t extenuation becomes utterly impo&s;&s;ible, and indignation is at a lo&s;s whether mo&s;t to con|demn the ignorance or the brutality of the pro|ceeding.</P>
<P>IT is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of a very celebrated author, that in proportion as every country is barbarous, it is addicted to inebriety. Were the people of England to be judged of by this &s;tandard, it is much to be feared, that our national cha|racter would be none of the mo&s;t amiable. Not|with&s;tanding few people can lay down better rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> behaviour than our&s;elves, there are none more unaccountably prepo&s;terous in their conduct: when we vi&s;it at one anothers hou&s;es, and propo&s;e to pa&s;s a few hours in an agreeable manner, how ab|&s;urdly do we &s;et out: in&s;tead of endeavouring to enjoy what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> finely calls
<Q>The fea&s;t of rea&s;on and the flow of &s;oul,</Q>
<PB N="8" REF="17">
we think every entertainment in&s;ipid till rea&s;on is totally bani&s;hed out of company; and imagine, through &s;ome mon&s;trous depravity of inclination, that a &s;ocial emanation of &s;oul is never to be ob|tained, but where politene&s;s and propriety are ap|parently &s;acrificed, and the roar of underbred ex|ce&s;s circulated round the room at the expence both of &s;en&s;e and morality.</P>
<P>TO the indelible di&s;grace of this country, there is &s;carcely a vice or a folly of our neighbours, but what we &s;edulou&s;ly copy, at the very moment we affect to mention the people who&s;e manners we thus ridiculou&s;ly imbibe, with the mo&s;t in&s;upe|rable di&s;regard. Their good qualities are in fact the only things which we &s;corn to adopt, as if it was a derogation either from our &s;pirit or our un|der&s;tanding to owe a &s;ingle in&s;tance of prudence or virtue to the force of example. France in par|ticular has kindly &s;upplied us with an abundance of follies; but there is not, to my recollection, any one circum&s;tance wherein &s;he has given the &s;malle&s;t improvement to our under&s;tandings: not that France is de&s;titute in &s;en&s;e, or deficient in virtue: it is we who want the wi&s;dom of imitating her where &s;he is really prai&s;e-worthy; and are infatuated to the lamentable degree of neglecting tho&s;e actions which we ought to pur&s;ue with our highe&s;t admiration, to follow tho&s;e which ought to be the objects of our highe&s;t aver&s;ion and con|tempt.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18">IN the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I mean their convivial en|tertainments, the French are particularly &s;en&s;ible and well-bred; they are all vivacity without run|ning into the lea&s;t indelicacy; and can keep up the nece&s;&s;ary life of a &s;ocial meeting, without bor|rowing the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from immorality. In the mo&s;t elevated flow of &s;pirits they never think of &s;ending the women out of company, merely to give an unbounded loo&s;e to ribaldry and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s. On the contrary, they e&s;timate the plea&s;ure of the entertainment by the number of the ladies; and look upon an evening to be mo&s;t wretchedly trifled away, where a party of men make an ap|pointment for a tavern. Thus their politene&s;s prevents them from deviating either into folly or vice; and in the mo&s;t intimate intercour&s;e of fami|lies, nothing &s;carcely ever pa&s;&s;es but a round of &s;en&s;ible freedom and uncon&s;trained civility.</P>
<P>WITH us, however, the ca&s;e is widely diffe|rent; if half a dozen friends meet at the hou&s;e of a valuable acquaintance, in&s;tead of treating his wife, his &s;i&s;ter, or his daughter, with a proper de|gree of re&s;pect; we all manife&s;t an ab&s;olute di&s;|inclination for their company. The in&s;tant the cloth is taken away we expect, they &s;hall retire, and look upon it as a piece of ill-breeding, if they accidentally &s;tay a moment longer than ordinary. And for what are we &s;o impatient to be left to our&s;elves? Why, for the mighty &s;atisfaction of drinking an ob&s;cene toa&s;t, and the plea&s;ure of in|di&s;criminately filling a bumper to a woman of ho|nour
<PB N="10" REF="19">
and a &s;trumpet; the friend of our bo&s;om, and a fellow whom we con&s;ider perhaps as the greate&s;t &s;coundrel in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>IN a country where the women are &s;o gene|rally remarkable for good-&s;en&s;e and delicate viva|city; where they al&s;o enjoy in other re&s;pects an ample &s;hare of liberty, and in a manner regulate the laws of propriety, it is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing that in the moments of convivial fe&s;tivity we &s;hould treat them with &s;o palpable a contempt. The hour in which we &s;trive to be mo&s;t happy, one would naturally imagine &s;hould be the time in which we ought mo&s;t earne&s;tly to &s;ollicit the favour of their company: but no; it is impo&s;&s;ible to make an Engli&s;hman happy without allowing him to run into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t illiberalities. The conver&s;ation of an amiable woman he thinks by no means equal to the roar of a di&s;&s;olute com|panion; and it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make him <HI>gloriou&s;ly drunk,</HI> as the fa&s;hionable phra&s;e is, before he can reach the envied pinnacle of a <HI>bon vivant</HI> felicity.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ante&s;t excu&s;e which all our choice &s;pirits give for this extraordinary attachment to toa&s;ting is, that without a toa&s;t, there would be no po&s;&s;ibility of finding a &s;ufficient fund of con|ver&s;ation for the company. Why then are the ladies excluded, who could add &s;o agreeably to the conver&s;ation? "O, becau&s;e their pre&s;ence would be an invincible re&s;traint; we could not lay what we plea&s;e, nor pu&s;h the toa&s;t about;" that
<PB N="11" REF="20">
is, in plain Engli&s;h, "we could not indulge our|&s;elves in a thou&s;and &s;candalous exce&s;&s;es, which would di&s;grace the lowe&s;t plebeian of the commu|nity: we could neither de&s;troy our con&s;titution nor our principles; neither give a loo&s;e to ob&s;ce|nity, intemperance, and execration; ridicule the laws of our country, nor fly out again&s;t the or|dinances of our God. Alas, civilized as we think our&s;elves, is it an impo&s;&s;ibility for a nation of &s;avages to be more barbarous or ab&s;urd? The ge|neral con&s;equence of our convivial meetings is the &s;evere&s;t reflexion which they can undergo, for with, all our boa&s;ted under&s;tanding, is it not rather an uncommon circum&s;tance for the mo&s;t intimate ac|quaintance to break up without &s;ome broil highly prejudicial to their friend&s;hip, if not even dan|gerous to their lives?</P>
<P>TO remedy &s;o great and &s;o univer&s;al an evil; to re&s;cue our national character from the imputa|tion of barbari&s;m; and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome little claim to the reputation of a civilized people, there are but two ways left; the&s;e however are both &s;hort and effectual ones: to aboli&s;h toa&s;ting in all taverns; and at all private hou&s;es, never to make the ladies withdraw from company. By this means, in the fir&s;t place, there will be no emula|tion among giddy-headed young fellows to &s;wallow another bumper; nor any obligation for a man with a weak con&s;titution to drink as hard as a &s;ea&s;oned Fox-hunter: and in the &s;econd in&s;tance, the meetings at private families by being conducted
<PB N="12" REF="21">
agreeable to the principles of politene&s;s, will never &s;werve from the &s;entiments either of rea&s;on or virtue, but be, as they always ought, productive of &s;ocial mirth and real happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH few people are le&s;s inclined than my&s;elf to cavil at the reputation of a great writer, yet it is with no little pain that I have often &s;een the public &s;o much ravi&s;hed with the <HI>whi&s;tling of a name,</HI> as to &s;tamp the very errors of an author with the &s;eal of admiration, and to think it impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e he was excellent on &s;ome particular &s;ubjects, but what he mu&s;t be equally eminent on all.</P>
<P>I AM led in&s;en&s;ibly into a reflexion of this na|ture, from a conver&s;ation which I had la&s;t in a polite company, about the celebrated fable of Sigi&s;|monda and Gui&s;card, as tran&s;lated from Boccace, by Mr. Dryden. This performance every body mentioned with an air of rapture; it was exqui&s;itely tender in the &s;entiment; a&s;toni&s;hingly nervous in the argument; and for ver&s;ification, was &s;uperior to any thing in the Engli&s;h language. For my own part, Mr. Babler, I could by no means &s;ee in what the amazing merit of this poem con&s;i&s;ted:
<PB N="13" REF="22">
as to the tendency, I am &s;ure it is to the la&s;t de|gree dangerous; as to the conduct, it is both again&s;t rea&s;on and nature; and as to the literary merit, though there is here and there an emanation of genius, yet where there is one tollerable line there are fifty infinitely too flat and in&s;ipid to be admitted into the la&s;t page of a common news|paper.</P>
<P>THAT I may not &s;eem on this occa&s;ion to reckon without my ho&s;t, I &s;hall take the liberty of recapitulating the principal circum&s;tances of the &s;tory; the&s;e therefore are as follow: Tancred king of Salerno, had a mo&s;t beautiful woman for a daughter, whom he married to a neighbouring monarch; but that prince dying, Sigi&s;monda, which was the name of the lady, returned to her father's court, and was received with a degree of uncommon rapture by her father, who had always loved her with an in|credible affection.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY, however, Sigi&s;monda was of a mo&s;t amorous con&s;titution; the poet him&s;elf tells us,
<Q><L>Youth, health, and ea&s;e, and a mo&s;t amorous mind,</L>
<L>To &s;econd nuptials had her thoughts inclin'd,</L>
<L>And former joys had left a &s;ecret <HI>&s;ting</HI> behind.</L></Q>
Had I a de&s;ign to critici&s;e &s;everely on the la&s;t line, I &s;hould naturally conclude that her decea&s;ed hu&s;band had bequeathed her &s;ome marks of his affection that required an immediate application to
<PB N="14" REF="23">
the &s;urgeon: but little errors are below a &s;erious ob&s;ervation. The <HI>&s;ting</HI> here mentioned, I &s;uppo&s;e, means nothing more than an encrea&s;ed de&s;ire for a bed-fellow; and therefore I &s;hall wave a com|ment upon the expre&s;&s;ion, and go on contentedly with my narrative.</P>
<P>THE warmth of Sigi&s;monda's con&s;titution, however, would not permit her to do without a lover; in order therefore to gratify her wi&s;hes, and yet offer no violence to the laws of virtue, &s;he ca&s;t her eyes round her father's court, and made choice of Gui&s;card, who had formerly been a page in the palace, and was not a little cele|brated both for his mental and per&s;onal accom|pli&s;hments; having determined in relation to the man, her next care was to make an appointment with him, which &s;he effected in a very artful man|ner, and went to the place of rendezvous her&s;elf, attended by a prie&s;t, that matters might be &s;ettled out of hand.</P>
<P>SIGISMONDA having now obtained her great wi&s;h, a hu&s;band, contrived by every means in her power, to keep the matter &s;till a &s;ecret from her father: but unluckily one day as &s;he was giving a loo&s;e to the warme&s;t tran&s;ports with her beloved Gui&s;card, the old king accidentally became a wit|ne&s;s of their intercour&s;e, and believing very na|turally that his daughter was a &s;trumpet, deter|mined, and in my opinion not unju&s;tly, to take an ample revenge on the man who had, as he con|ceived, &s;o audaciou&s;ly violated the honour of his
<PB N="15" REF="24">
family; with this view he retired for that time unperceived, and ordered a couple of &s;turdy fellows to way-lay Gui&s;card and take him into cu&s;tody, the next time he paid a &s;ecret vi&s;it to the prince&s;s. This order was executed accordingly; and Sigi&s;|monda was &s;tretched upon the lover's hell a whole night, impatiently waiting for the appearance of her hu&s;band, and burning at once with all the ve|hemence of the mo&s;t ardent expectation, and all the fury of the mo&s;t inordinate love.</P>
<P>NEXT morning when &s;he appeared before her father, the good old king, to pre&s;erve the dignity of both their characters, treated her with his ac|cu&s;tomed tenderne&s;s, till all their attendants re|tired; he then, in the mo&s;t affecting terms, de|claimed upon her guilt, mentioned his own ex|ce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for her, and begged &s;he would &s;ay &s;omething in extenuation of her crime, &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible to varni&s;h it over with any fea&s;ible excu&s;e. He concluded, however, with the &s;tronge&s;t menaces again&s;t Gui&s;card, &s;till imagining that he was nothing more than the paramour of his daughter.</P>
<P>HITHERTO Tancred's behaviour was nothing but what might be rea&s;onably expected both from a monarch and a man. But the delicate Sigi&s;|monda, to e&s;tabli&s;h the character of a heroine, was to act in immediate oppo&s;ition to the &s;enti|ments of nature. In&s;tead therefore of falling at her father's feet, and endeavouring to excite his pity and forgivene&s;s, &s;he put on the unblu&s;hing
<PB N="16" REF="25">
front of a Govent Garden &s;trumpet; called him a tyrant repeatedly; and told him, that &s;he had married Gui&s;card from an impo&s;&s;ibility to live with out an intercour&s;e of &s;ex with &s;ome body, &s;ince he (Tancred) took &s;o little pains to get her ano|ther hu&s;band. That I may not &s;eem to exaggerate I &s;hall here give part of Tancred's &s;peech, and part of her reply.</P>
<Q><L>As I have lov'd, and yet I love thee more,</L>
<L>Than ever father lov'd a child before;</L>
<L>So that indulgence draws me to forgive;</L>
<L>Nature that gives thee life would have thee live.</L>
<L>But as a public parent of the &s;tate,</L>
<L>My ju&s;tice, and thy crime, requires thy fate.</L>
<L>Fain would I choo&s;e a middle cour&s;e to &s;teer:</L>
<L>Nature's too kind, and ju&s;tice too &s;evere:</L>
<L>Speak for us both, and to the balance bring</L>
<L>On either &s;ide the father and the king.</L>
<L>Heav'n knows my heart is bent to favour thee;</L>
<L>Make it but &s;canty weight and leave the re&s;t to me.</L>
<L>Here &s;topping with a &s;igh, he pour'd a flood</L>
<L>Of tears, to make the la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion good.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>FROM this behaviour of Tancred's, and from the prodigious fondne&s;s which he had always ma|nife&s;ted for her, Sigi&s;monda, had the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on in the world to expect a pardon from her father; but no &mdash; &s;he was to treat the venerable prince with the utmo&s;t indignity; to &s;et an ex|ample of ignorant di&s;obedience to all po&s;terity; and to &s;acrifice the life of a man whom &s;he pa&s;&s;io|nately
<PB N="17" REF="26">
loved, merely becau&s;e the poet wanted to make her an heroine. &mdash; <HI>Ri&s;um teneatis amici.</HI> &mdash; Here begins her an&s;wer,
<Q><L>Tancred, I neither am di&s;po&s;ed to make</L>
<L>Reque&s;t for life, nor offer'd life to take;</L>
<L>Much le&s;s deny the deed, but lea&s;t of all</L>
<L>Beneath pretended ju&s;tice weakly fall,</L>
<L>My words to &s;acred truth &s;hall be confin'd,</L>
<L>My deeds &s;hall &s;hew the greatne&s;s of my mind.</L>
<L>That I have lov'd I own; that &s;till I love,</L>
<L>I call to witne&s;s all the pow'rs above:</L>
<L>Yet more I own; to Gui&s;card's love I give</L>
<L>The &s;mall remaining time I have to live;</L>
<L>And if beyond this life de&s;ire can be,</L>
<L>Not fate it&s;elf &s;hall &s;et my pa&s;&s;ion free.</L>
<L>This fir&s;t avow'd; nor folly warp'd my mind,</L>
<L>Nor the frail texture of the female kind</L>
<L>Betray'd my virtue; for too well I knew</L>
<L>What honour was, and honour had his due.</L>
<L>Before the holy prie&s;t my vows were ty'd,</L>
<L>So came I not a &s;trumpet, but a bride;</L>
<L>This for my fame and for the public voice:</L>
<L>Yet more, his merits ju&s;tified my choice;</L>
<L>Which had they not, the fir&s;t election thine,</L>
<L>That bond di&s;&s;olv'd, the next is freely mine;</L>
<L>Or grant I err'd, (which yet I mu&s;t deny)</L>
<L>Had parents pow'r even &s;econd vows to tie;</L>
<L>Thy little care to mend my widow'd nights,</L>
<L>Has forc'd me to recour&s;e of marriage rites,</L>
<L>To fill an empty &s;ide, and follow known de|lights.</L>
<L>What have I done in this de&s;erving blame?</L>
<L>State-laws may alter, nature's are the &s;ame;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="27">The&s;e are u&s;urp'd on helple&s;s women kind,</L>
<L>Made without our con&s;ent, and wanting pow'r to bind.</L></Q></P>
<P>SIGISMONDA's harangue you know, Mr. Bab|ler, is a very long one, and in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages contains &s;entiments infinitely too gro&s;s for the ear of a delicate reader. The public, however, from the&s;e cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations, will immediately &s;ee, that the conduct of Tancred, if not totally excu|&s;able, has at lea&s;t not a little to be &s;aid in it's de|fence; and they will al&s;o &s;ee, that highly as Sigi&s;|monda has been admired for her &s;pirit and her vir|tue by a number of writers, that admiration has been much more the effect of their complai&s;ance than the re&s;ult of her de&s;ervings.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WALKING lately through a church-yard to the northward of this metropolis, I was not a little entertained with an in&s;cription upon the tomb&s;tone of an hone&s;t Cooper, which by way of arrogating his con&s;equence, mentioned, that had he lived but two years longer, he had been junior warden of his company.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="28">IT is an ab&s;urd opinion which a great many people entertain, that pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency are entirely confined to the &s;uperior orders of man|kind, &s;ince the minute&s;t examination into human nature would &s;ufficiently convince us, that the verie&s;t plebeian in creation has his &s;pecies of va|nity, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome particular advantage, which in his own opinion gives him a pre-eminence over all the world; a ribband or a &s;tar we gene|rally imagine to be no incon&s;iderable &s;ources of &s;elf-&s;ufficience; yet I have &s;een a farmer's &s;ervant in his Sunday's cotton wai&s;tcoat, a&s;&s;ume more airs, and &s;trut about a village with a look of greater con&s;equence than ever I &s;aw among a croud of the fir&s;t nobility in the drawing-room.</P>
<P>HOWEVER we may look upon pride to be the offspring of condition, a very &s;mall &s;hare of re|collection will convince us, that the latent prin|ciples of it are equally implanted in the bo&s;oms of high and low by the unre&s;pecting hand of nature; and perhaps when we come to con&s;ider matters a little farther, we may find that this very pride is given us by the particular goodne&s;s of providence to reconcile us to our various &s;ituations, and to rai&s;e the chearful &s;un of &s;erenity upon that lot, which we might otherwi&s;e be tempted to look upon with a con&s;tant mortification and regret. Thus far &s;elf-&s;ufficience may be looked upon, not only as u&s;eful, but as fortunate: the moment, ne|verthele&s;s, in which it leads us to forget what is due to the merits of others, that moment it de|viates
<PB N="20" REF="29">
from the original end of its in&s;titution, be|comes criminal as well as ridiculous, and equally expo&s;es us to the univer&s;al aver&s;ion and the uni|ver&s;al contempt.</P>
<P>THE more we examine the behaviour of man|kind, the le&s;s difference we &s;hall find made by the circum&s;tance of rank. The vices of the mo&s;t op|po&s;ite orders, like their follies, are pretty nearly related, and &s;pring pretty much from the &s;ame motives, if we may form the lea&s;t opinion by their ends: if the man of fa&s;hion &s;quanders away an e&s;tate at Newmarket; the journeyman artizan is equally ready to part with his all at an humble game of Dutch pins, or the throwing of a piece at the &s;huffle-board: if his grace finds the &s;ummit of human felicity in a <HI>bon vivant</HI> circle at Almacks or the Cocoa Tree, the porter is equally happy over a tankard of <HI>Calvert's Entire Butt</HI> at the Hor&s;e-&s;hoe and Magpye, and looks upon him&s;elf to be every whit as much entitled to a right of damning the waiter, and di&s;turbing the company, as the fir&s;t lord in the univer&s;e; nay, in his amours, he is to the full as profligate, and will pick up his occa&s;ional <HI>fille de joye,</HI> with the &s;ame happy inattention to the con&s;titution of his wife and the welfare of his family. Condition in fact is the child of fortune, and rank, though it may poli&s;h the cour&s;e of na|ture, can never totally alter it; &s;o that to &s;uppo&s;e the various &s;ituations of life are not actuated by &s;imilar inclination in the main, is to &s;uppo&s;e our|&s;elves
<PB N="21" REF="30">
totally unacquainted both with the &s;enti|ments of the world, and the principles of common under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>TO make a proper application of the foregoing reflexions, we mu&s;t con&s;ider that in di&s;po&s;ing of the various lots in human affairs, the benignity of providence intended an equal portion of felicity for all: he wi&s;ely de&s;igned that if the poor man had nothing more than a cottage, his wi&s;hes &s;hould be contracted to the &s;canty limits of his little hut; and meant to ble&s;s him with as ample a portion of content over an humble meal of vegetables, as if all the luxuries of the univer&s;e were collected for his entertainment, and &s;erved up in the mo&s;t captivating rounds of an exqui&s;ite variety and a &s;triking magnificence. It is generally the fault of man him&s;elf, if ever he is wretched. True happine&s;s, as I have already &s;aid, exi&s;ts only in the mind, how|ever ab&s;urdly we may &s;uppo&s;e it to the re&s;ult from an affluence of circum&s;tances, or an elevation of dignity; he therefore that complains of being mi&s;erable, does nothing more in fact, than up|braid him&s;elf with incon&s;i&s;tency; his wretched|ne&s;s, if he &s;eriou&s;ly enters into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the matter, will be found to proceed from the want of &s;omething which he can do very well without; and every foundation of complaint will appear to be the con&s;equence of his own folly, notwith|&s;tanding the impious &s;uppo&s;ition that it entirely ari&s;es from the unkindne&s;s of his God.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31">OF all the philo&s;ophers I ever met, I don't remember to have known &s;o truly &s;en&s;ible a fellow as poor Dick Wilkins. Dick by never indulging too &s;anguine an expectation, was &s;ure to encounter but few di&s;appointments; where he wanted real foundations for <HI>affirmative</HI> happine&s;s, if I may beg the word, he would build him&s;elf a kind of ne|gative felicity, and out of misfortunes, which other people looked upon as irreparable, furni&s;h him&s;elf with continual &s;ubjects of con&s;olation. Thus when his hou&s;e was burnt to the ground, in&s;tead, of lamenting over the lo&s;s, he rejoiced that he him&s;elf had not peri&s;hed in the flames; and once, when the &s;mall pox had &s;natched away a fine little girl of whom he was exce&s;&s;ively fond, Dick re|turned thanks to providence, that the di&s;temper had communicated to no other per&s;on in his family; by this means he got the better of calamity, and &s;tarted from the furnace of affliction with an ad|ditional degree of excellence in proportion as he was tried. Is it nece&s;&s;ary to enforce this example with the reader of under&s;tanding? By no manner of means. Heroes and philo&s;ophers have been frequently propo&s;ed as objects of univer&s;al admira|tion, their lives, however, are infinitely inferior, in point of moral in&s;truction, to hone&s;t Dick Wilkins; they may dazzle, but he delights; and though we dwell with a kind of awe upon the ex|alted tin&s;el of a celebrated name, yet rea&s;on always gives a preference to tho&s;e characters, who have
<PB N="23" REF="32">
mo&s;t eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves both as chri&s;tians and as men.</P>

<P>THOUGH it is univer&s;ally allowed that we are every day arriving to a greater degree of knowledge in our theatrical entertainments, yet a number of &s;en&s;ible critics are continually in&s;i&s;ting that there is a vi&s;ible decay in our dramatical pro|ductions; not only our performers, but our writers are mentioned in a light of the mo&s;t contemptuous compari&s;on with their predece&s;&s;ors of the la&s;t half century; and it is con&s;idered by the generality of people, as an in&s;tance either of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t igno|rance, or the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption, to &s;uppo&s;e any thing like an equal degree of abilities.</P>
<P>THE gentlemen who critici&s;e in this accurate manner, &s;eem, however, to pay but little attention to the original in&s;titution of the &s;tage; they ima|gine it was entirely calculated for amu&s;ement, without having the lea&s;t view to the great bu&s;ine&s;s of in&s;truction, and &s;o it could produce a ridiculous laugh, no matter what became either of our morals or our under&s;tandings. This whim&s;ical mode of thinking, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover, has taken it's ri&s;e from the comedies of Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanburg, who always with a culpable degree of levity, were endeavouring to &s;ay brilliant things rather than ju&s;t ones; and injudiciou&s;ly imagined
<PB N="24" REF="33">
that a lively fla&s;h of wit was a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for the ranke&s;t indecencies, or the mo&s;t palpable at|tack upon the religion of their country.</P>
<P>THAT our dramatic writers, before the la&s;t half century, might po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater &s;hare of wit than their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors I &s;hall by no means deny; but then it does not follow that this &s;uperiority in wit, &s;hould entitle them to a &s;uperiority of repu|tation. Wit, in fact, is but a &s;econdary requi&s;ite to a dramatic poet; judgment is the fir&s;t qualifi|cation; and he that wi&s;ely attends to the cultivation of the mind, is by much a preferable writer to him, who &s;acrifices every thing to an agreeable flip|pancy of expre&s;&s;ion, and aims at nothing more than to excite the ri&s;ibility of his auditors. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, though I admire Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanburg, as men of wit, yet as dramatic au|thors, I hold them in no extraordinary e&s;timation: on the contrary, I look upon them with the greate&s;t contempt, for perverting the original end of the &s;tage, and pro&s;tituting &s;uch abilities as they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in the infamous purpo&s;es of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and immorality.</P>
<P>I AM well aware that upon this occa&s;ion it will be remarked, that the literary levity of the&s;e ce|lebrated writers was the vice of their age, and that in conformity to the general opinion, they were under a nece&s;&s;ity of writing to the depravities of the people. &mdash; "If, &s;ay a number of our &s;agacious critics, the authors under con&s;ideration, repre&s;ented human nature in a de&s;olute light, they repre&s;ented
<PB N="25" REF="34">
human nature as they found it. &mdash; Their villains and their &s;trumpets were characters very frequently met with, and they only caught the manners as they ro&s;e to reflect them with an additional energy on the public." This argument is evidently falla|cious; and can &s;carce de&s;erve a &s;erious examina|tion: to repre&s;ent human nature as they found it, would have giving no room for exception; but their great error was in repre&s;enting tho&s;e parts of it, in an amiable light, which were entitled to univer&s;al abhorrence and contempt. Their villains and their &s;trumpets were &s;et up as objects of general admiration; and vice fought under the ma&s;k of an agreeable vivacity, with a &s;ucce&s;s that &s;hould make every feeling mind tremble, left &s;o dangerous a weapon as wit, &s;hould at any future period be unhappily lodged in &s;uch de&s;perate hands.</P>
<P>IT has often filled me with a&s;toni&s;hment to hear men of good &s;en&s;e frequently arguing in de|fence of Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanburg, by &s;aying that their wit &s;hould be an excu&s;e for their licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and pleading that it was even worth our while to have vicious compo&s;itions, provided the vice was but decorated with &s;uch forcible at|tractions as the&s;e writers have given it. People who talk in this manner may indeed look down upon the corrector productions of later days, with an air of in&s;uperable di&s;gu&s;t. They may equally laugh at nature and in&s;truction, and affect to ri|dicule every argument to which they find them|&s;elves unable to reply: but the judicious enquirer,
<PB N="26" REF="35">
will con&s;ider wit when employed in the de&s;truction of virtue, as the mo&s;t infamous of all pro&s;titutions. &mdash; It is like a man of genius, who argues again&s;t the exi&s;tence of the Deity; and becomes obnoxious to &s;ociety in proportion as he is cur&s;ed with abili|ties; in&s;tead therefore, of being found a ju&s;tifica|tion of the writers in di&s;pute, it becomes, in my opinion, an invincible objection to their works; and the more we are fa&s;cinated with the brilliancy of their productions, the more we &s;ee a nece&s;&s;ity for wi&s;hing tho&s;e productions had peri&s;hed at their fir&s;t appearance under the hands of the common executioner.</P>
<P>THE writers of the pre&s;ent times, however de&s;pi&s;ed by the bigots of a dramatical here&s;y, have, if we may judge by their performances, an in|finitely &s;tronger claim to our admiration, than any of their celebrated predece&s;&s;ors, who actuated by an illiberal thir&s;t of fame, were led to &s;eek it from the depravities of mankind. They &s;en&s;ibly recollect that the &s;ole end of the &s;tage is to blend amu&s;ement with in&s;truction; and therefore never neglect the heart, through a view of bawding to the imagination; &mdash; hence, in&s;tead of finding them eternally on the &s;ent for &s;nip-&s;nap and repartee, we &s;ee them &s;tudious in the di&s;covery of manly &s;entiments and laudable reflexions; and ob&s;erve a general endeavour, while they labour for our ap|probation as writers, to obtain our good opinion as men. This good opinion they will be always &s;ure of obtaining, as long as they pro&s;ecute the
<PB N="27" REF="36">
exalted principles which have hitherto influenced their conduct; and it is with the greate&s;t &s;atis|faction I &s;ee their pieces frequently repre&s;ented to crouded audiences, while the productions of a Wycherly, a Congreve, and a Vanburg are &s;uffered to langui&s;h in the mo&s;t merited contempt.</P>

<P>I KNOW nothing more dangerous than for a man of narrow circum&s;tances to po&s;&s;e&s;s an agreeable voice, or to be ma&s;ter of any other re|qui&s;ite which expo&s;es him to a continual round of company, and renders him particularly enter|taining to his acquaintance. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the general applau&s;e, with which he meets, gives him an eternal di&s;gu&s;t to indu&s;try; and fills him with no ambition but that of being called upon for ano|ther &s;ong, or reque&s;ted to relate the la&s;t frolic within the purlieus of the garden.</P>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday taking a &s;olitary walk in the Park, when I accidently &s;aw a figure &s;eated on one of the benches, with the lines of who&s;e face I found my&s;elf &s;omewhat familiar, and in the cour&s;e of half a turn recollected that it was a young fellow who had formerly been clerk to my friend Mr. Demur, a coun&s;ellor in Lincoln's-inn, and was turned away by his ma&s;ter, for a total neglect of bu&s;ine&s;s. I had been often at Mr. Demur's, and had always heard him &s;peak of this young
<PB N="28" REF="37">
man with a particular e&s;teem: to me he frequently recommended him on the &s;core of uncommon ho|ne&s;ty, and extraordinary abilities; neverthele&s;s, he at the &s;ame time ob&s;erved, that he never would be worth a groat. <Q>The blockhead, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;ings an excellent &s;ong, and has a fund of humour that renders him infinitely entertaining; on this account he has &s;uch a number of en|gagements upon his hands, that I cannot keep him a moment at the de&s;k; and though I love him almo&s;t as well as my own &s;on, I mu&s;t look out for &s;ome body el&s;e to &s;upply his place.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN I came down the walk, the young fellow bowed to me, and as his appearance was uncom|monly &s;habby, I had either the curio&s;ity, or the good nature to go over to him, and enquire what brought him into &s;uch a mi&s;erable plight; with the frankne&s;s that always accompanies a good heart; he told me it was his own folly; and added, that tho&s;e who wantonly &s;ported with their own felicity, ought never to be pitied in the day of di&s;tre&s;s. The manner in which the&s;e la&s;t words were delivered, &s;truk me very &s;en&s;ibly; I therefore &s;at down with him on the bench, and reque&s;ted if he could with propriety, that he would favour me with his &s;tory, a&s;&s;uring him, I always had a tear at the &s;ervice of the unfortunate, and probably he might experience that I had &s;omething el&s;e. En|couraged by this information, he gave a bow of a&s;&s;ent, and proceeded with the following little narrative:</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="38">IT is unnece&s;&s;ary, Sir, to tell you anything about my education or family; &s;uffice it that though the former was not de&s;picable, nor the latter ungenteel, yet I had nothing to depend upon but my profe&s;&s;ion; this indeed afforded me a tol|lerable probability of pa&s;&s;ing decently through life, had not an unhappy propen&s;ity to company fatally intervened, and rendered that application to bu|&s;ine&s;s intollerable, which prudence pointed out as the only means of my &s;upport.</P>
<P>THIS propen&s;ity to company was increa&s;ed to a con&s;iderable degree, from &s;ome trifling talents which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to amu&s;e, &s;uch as a pa&s;&s;able &s;ong, and a mode of telling a &s;tory with tollerable &s;uc|ce&s;s. The&s;e qualifications procured me &s;o much regard among my friends that there never was a merry meeting appointed but Will Hargrave re|ceived an invitation, they were &s;ure he would favour them with a joyous catch; and often the&s;e applications were made with a &s;olicitude which tickled my vanity &s;o highly, that I have &s;uffered my&s;elf to be engaged a whole month without in|termi&s;&s;ion, and kept as regular a li&s;t of my various taverns, as if I had been allowed a very hand|&s;ome &s;alary for my attendance. A cu&s;tom of this nature could not be &s;upported without a great deal of expence; a crown or half a guinea every night was rather too much for a man, who with &s;alary and perqui&s;ites, &s;carcely made eighty pounds a year; the con&s;equence of which was, that I ran
<PB N="30" REF="39">
into debt with every body that would tru&s;t me, and forfeited my reputation through an utter in|ability of di&s;charging their demands: be&s;ides this, as I was always one of the la&s;t people who quitted company, I was generally intoxicated before I re|tired, and de&s;troyed my con&s;titution as much as I ruined my circum&s;tances. A man who con&s;tantly went to bed in &s;uch a condition at four or five o'clock in the morning was but ill qualified for the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. After putting up with a thou&s;and irregularities, your friend Mr. Demur, at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, and my character be|ing pretty well known to all the gentlemen of the profe&s;&s;ion, not a &s;oul of them would receive me into his employ. In this &s;ituation a vintner, who&s;e hou&s;e I had often filled with company, ar|re&s;ted me for a debt of fourteen pounds, threw me into jail, and kept me there till I was &s;et at liberty by an act of grace at the end of four years. The hard&s;hips I underwent during the time of my con|finement were un&s;peakable; for days together I have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on nothing but the common allowance of the pri&s;on, and have thought my&s;elf happy if I could get a handful of &s;traw to &s;leep on at night; a &s;hirt was luxury with which I was utterly unacquainted for eighteen months; and during the la&s;t year, my intire wardrobe con&s;i&s;ted of an old plaid night-gown; a pair of decayed Morocco &s;lippers of different colours, a wor&s;ted night-cap, and a black &s;tock. I almo&s;t forgot the u&s;e of breeches and &s;tockings, and could I dare to &s;ay have
<PB N="31" REF="40">
pa&s;&s;ed a winter in Greenland without any appre|hen&s;ion from the coldne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on or the place. Fortunately, a week or two before my re|lea&s;e, an Iri&s;h author who was ju&s;t put in for libel|ling the government, happened to hear of me, and gave me an invitation to his room; I had long learned to di&s;regard the delicacies of dre&s;s, and therefore attended him without delay; he was &s;en&s;ible and generous in every re&s;pect, unle&s;s his compa&s;&s;ion to me &s;hould be reckoned an impeach|ment, either of his under&s;tanding or his munifi|cence, for before I took my leave, he made me a pre&s;ent of two very hand&s;ome &s;uits of cloathes, and half a dozen ruffled &s;hirts, together with every other nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch as hat and wig, &s;hoes and &s;tockings, &s;o that when I equipped my&s;elf, I might have ea&s;ily made my e&s;cape at the gate, as it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to know me in &s;uch a happy al|teration of circum&s;tances. My benefactor's gene|ro&s;ity did not &s;top here; for, the morning after I was di&s;charged, he &s;ent me five guineas, and wi&s;h|ing me every happine&s;s I could wi&s;h my&s;elf, ad|vi&s;ed me to make a good u&s;e of what in&s;truction I had received in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity. I in|tened to have thanked him the next day; but un|happily that evening he had a difference with a brother pri&s;oner, about &s;ome incon&s;iderable &s;ubject of a political nature, in which he received the lye; this being an affront, which an Iri&s;hman never pardons, he in&s;i&s;ted upon in&s;tant &s;atisfaction: both parties immediately drew, and my generous friend
<PB N="32" REF="41">
by &s;ome accident happening to &s;tumble ju&s;t as his antagoni&s;t was making a lunge, he received a thru&s;t through the body, and expired on the &s;pot; the other gentleman was tried, but as it was proved the challenge was given by the decea&s;ed, the &s;urvivor had a verdict of man &s;laughter brought in again&s;t him, and &s;uffered the puni&s;hment of being burned with a <HI>cold iron,</HI> agreeable to the cu&s;tomary practice.</P>
<P>TO return however to my&s;elf: being now quite clear with the world, and dre&s;&s;ed in a man|ner tollerably &s;mart, I &s;allied forth, and was met by &s;ome of my quondam acquaintance, who when I was peri&s;hing would not &s;upply me with a &s;ix|pence; but who now were rejoiced at &s;eeing me in &s;o happy a &s;ituation; they in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;pend|ing the evening with them at a club, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> every night in the neighbourhood of Temple-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and hoped I would not take it a mi&s;s if they in&s;i&s;ted upon charging my quota to the general account, for the plea&s;ure of my company. I was not lo&s;t to &s;en&s;ibility: in the meridian of my own little affluence I had done kind things to others, but never in&s;ulted their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The manner of the propo&s;al affected me, though I was under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of agreeing to the propo&s;al it&s;elf; I there|fore went, and was treated with all the u&s;ual di&s;re&s;pect which poverty generally feels from un|derbred pro&s;perity. I was commanded to &s;ing by one with a look of authority; a &s;econd ordered me to tell a &s;tory, and a third cracked an in&s;olent
<PB N="33" REF="42">
joke about my want of breeches in pri&s;on, and told me, with a loud laugh, I would have made an excellent highlander. In &s;hort, though, every body courted my conver&s;ation, yet every body treated me with contempt; and I never &s;uffered more &s;e|verely under the hand of in&s;olence than when I mini&s;tered mo&s;t to it's &s;atisfaction; though I tore my lungs almo&s;t to pieces for half a dozen hours, &s;till I was under an obligation for being treated to a two-&s;hilling reckoning; and it even now has come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that I am looked upon as an incumbrance to the &s;ociety; not knowing where to get a bit of bread, I came here to-day, intend|ing to li&s;t my&s;elf in the guards; but being torn by a thou&s;and different thoughts, I threw my&s;elf into this &s;eat to ruminate a little further, when the earne&s;tne&s;s with which you were plea&s;ed to eye me, obliged me to pull off my hat, and laid a foundation for all this in&s;ignificant garrulity.</P>
<P>HERE poor Mr. Hargrave ended; I will not comment on this &s;tory, &mdash; if the relation it&s;elf is not capable of in&s;truction, it is in vain to moralize, and in vain to talk of prudence and oeconomy; all I &s;hall therefore mention is, that he &s;ets out next week in a lucrative employ for one of our plantations: and I doubt not, as he is yet a very young man, but what a few years will &s;ee him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very ample fortune.</P>

<P>I WAS chatting ye&s;terday evening over a di&s;h of tea at my &s;i&s;ter Rattle's when the amiable Kitty Harold, a di&s;tant relation of ours, happened to come in with her u&s;ual freedom, but with an ap|pearance of mingled concern and re&s;entment; the moment &s;he &s;aw me &s;he cried, <Q>O, Mr. Babler, I have an admirable &s;ubject for your next paper. You mu&s;t know, continued &s;he, that in my way here I accidently called at your old acquaintance Mrs. Acid's, in Pall-Mall, and found her en|gaged with an exten&s;ive circle of company. While I &s;taid there, one of the footmen came up and informed his lady that there was a well-dre&s;&s;ed gentlewoman below enquiring after her health, but that hearing &s;he was &s;o much en|gaged, &s;he was preparing to go away, and would take &s;ome other opportunity of paying her re&s;|pects. Mrs. Acid you know is one of tho&s;e prodigiou&s;ly important people who pique them|&s;elves upon their &s;uperior under&s;tandings, and are continually giving an air of con&s;equence to the minute&s;t actions: in hopes therefore of di&s;|playing her &s;agacity before her company, &s;he &s;ent to de&s;ire the lady would be &s;o kind as to walk up; in con&s;equence of which a mighty genteel woman indeed, was introduced, who came in with a very vi&s;ible diffidence, and was
<PB N="35" REF="44">
with much pre&s;&s;ing prevailed upon to &s;it down. Madam, &s;ays Mrs. Acid, with her cu&s;tomary dignity of tone and &s;olemnity of feature, Pray what has procured me the honour of this vi&s;it? the lady with a re&s;pectful he&s;itation, replied, I thought, madam, I &s;hould have found you alone, or I would not have pre&s;umed &mdash; but I &s;uppo&s;e you have quite forgot a Sally Edwards, who lived with you about &s;even years ago;" What, exclaimed Mrs. Acid, in an air of the greate&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, are you Sally Edwards who lived with me at Richmond, and had a ba&s;tard by young Mr. Barrington of Twickenham &mdash; O I remember you very well &mdash; why I hear he has &s;ince married you &mdash; well and come tell me.</Q> Mrs. Acid would probaby have continued this good-natured &s;train con&s;iderably longer, had not the poor woman's confu&s;ion got the better of her &s;pirits, and thrown her into a fit from which &s;he was not recovered without much difficulty; as &s;oon however as &s;he came to her&s;elf, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and making as decent a curte&s;y as her &s;ituation could po&s;&s;ibly admit, went out of the room. Unmoved with her di&s;tre&s;s, the obliging Mrs. Acid called after her down &s;tairs; <Q>Dont be unea&s;y Sally, when you come this way again pray bring the little boy with you.</Q> I really could have &s;lapt the unmerciful woman for her barbarity: but &s;he, as if &s;he had performed the mo&s;t meritorious action in the world, turned round
<PB N="36" REF="45">
to the company, and gave us the following hi&s;tory of poor Sally Edwards.</P>
<P>"HER father was a Shrop&s;hire Clergyman of very little preferment in the church; but if a large family might be looked upon as a foundation for felicity, there was not a happier man in the coun|try, for he had fourteen children. The excellence of his character, however, made &s;ome provi&s;ion for the mo&s;t of them, and one friend or another gradually took the greate&s;t number off his hands. This Sally, of all his children, was the greate&s;t fa|vourite; he would never part with her, but brought her up with a remarkable degree of tenderne&s;s, and even pinched him&s;elf very frequently to give her an education rather &s;uperior to her fortune. His &s;olicitude for her improvement, Mrs. Acid de|clares was not thrown away: on the contrary, &s;he a&s;&s;ured us that Sally was very prettily accompli&s;h|ed; and added, in her way, that &s;he was al&s;o not intolerably tempered, nor much unacquainted with the management of a family.</P>
<P>WHEN Sally had reached her twentieth year, a fever which her father had caught in attending a poor pari&s;hioner, carried him off, and the amiable orphan was obliged to look out for &s;ome tolerable family, where her &s;ervitude might furni&s;h her with bread. Mrs. Acid at that time happened to be down at her &s;i&s;ter's in Shrop&s;hire, near who&s;e hou&s;e Mr. Edwards had lived. At her &s;i&s;ter's reque&s;t &s;he took Sally, being then without a maid, and in a few weeks after departed for London. From
<PB N="37" REF="46">
thence &s;he removed to Richmond, where Sally became by &s;ome means acquainted with a very genteel young fellow, one Mr. Barrington, the &s;on of a gentleman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed two thou&s;and pounds a year. Mr. Barrington made u&s;e of num|berle&s;s arts to &s;teal her from the paths of virtue, and even offered half the rever&s;ion of his father's e&s;tate to purcha&s;e her di&s;grace. The&s;e overtures Sally treated with a becoming &s;corn, yet &s;he had a latent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour, which would not &s;uffer her to re&s;ign the dangerous plea&s;ure of his acquaintance. Every hour &s;he could &s;pare was pa&s;&s;ed with him, and he kept him&s;elf &s;o &s;ecretly concealed, that his rank was never once &s;u&s;pected in the neighbourhood. Young Barrington did not want honour; he &s;aw the goodne&s;s of his mi&s;tre&s;s's heart, notwith&s;tanding the humility of her &s;tation, and therefore di&s;regarding what the world might &s;ay on the occa&s;ion, very frankly propo&s;ed to mar|ry her. This propo&s;al immediately ruined the unfortunate Sally Edwards; what formerly he could not obtain for worlds, now fell an ea&s;y &s;acrifice to his genero&s;ity. She confe&s;&s;ed &s;he loved him; but ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed the honour of his hand till after the death of his father, declaring &s;he could not &s;up|port the &s;hock of creating a di&s;turbance in his fami|ly. When a woman once owns her love for a man there is &s;carce a to&s;s up between her and de&s;truction. Every hour &s;he is alone with him after &s;uch a con|fe&s;&s;ion, &s;he totters on the verge of her fate; and even let the man have never &s;o much honour, there
<PB N="38" REF="47">
are times in which the whirlwind of his pa&s;&s;ions will tear up every trace of recollection, and occa&s;i|on more guilt in a &s;econd, than can po&s;&s;ibly be ato|ned for in cour&s;e of a whole life. In one of the&s;e times Mr. Barrington met Sally Edwards; and in about &s;ix monthsafter the con&s;equences of this cri|minal intercour&s;e obliged the unhappy girl to take an abrupt leave of her place. The &s;equel howe|ver is more fortunate than could be expected. Old Mr. Barrington died near a twelvemonth &s;ince, and his &s;on has been married to Sally above half a year. This it &s;eems was her fir&s;t coming to town &s;ince that joyful event, and in hopes to recover the good opinion of her former mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he had taken the liberty of calling at Pall Mall. Mrs. Acid neverthele&s;s embraced the opportunity to in&s;ult her in the manner I have mentioned; and &s;o far from feeling any compunction, &s;he told us at the end of the &s;tory, that &s;he was always known to &s;peak her mind, and fancied upon this occa&s;ion that &s;he had given a <HI>tolerable hint,</HI> as &s;he called it, to Sally Edwards."</P>
<P>HERE Mi&s;s Harold fini&s;hed her little narrative, but the &s;ubject being dwelt upon while &s;he &s;taid, I &s;hall conclude the pre&s;ent paper with one or two of her remarks. "I always ob&s;erve, Mr. Babler, (&s;ays &s;he) that tho&s;e people who pique them&s;elves particularly on the virtue of a rude &s;incerity, have &s;eldom any other virtue in the compo&s;ition of their characters. A complacency of manners though it does not always con&s;titute humanity, neverthele&s;s
<PB N="39" REF="48">
gives an embelli&s;hment to human nature, and often, from the very appearance of goodne&s;s, we are apt to fall in love with the reality. It would therefore be well, that people who are fond of &s;peaking in|delicate truths to others, would rever&s;e &s;ituations a little, and only imagine what effect it would have upon their own feelings, was an indelicate truth to be mentioned to them&s;elves. Whenever we change &s;ituations with mankind, we are mo&s;t like|ly to judge with propriety; and we may be certain of never cen&s;uring the errors of our neighbours with too great a degree of &s;everity, if we make but a candid examination into our own."</P>

<P><PB N="40" REF="49">I DINED about a week ago in the neighbourhood of Piccadilly, at the hou&s;e of an old friend, with whom I make it a kind of point to pa&s;s a day once a twelvemonth: this gentleman, together with his whole family, pique them&s;elves, not a little, upon their knowledge in the minute&s;t article of breeding, and are univer&s;ally e&s;teemed a very polite &s;et by the mo&s;t critical circle of their acquain|tance.

When the &s;alutations of the &s;ea&s;ons were over, I was permitted to take a chair, which I did by my friend, at one corner of the fire, and left the re&s;t to the old lady and her daughters. For a full half hour we &s;at in a &s;leepine&s;s of &s;ilent &s;tupidity; not &s;o much as a &s;ingle que&s;tion pa&s;&s;ed between us, either about the &s;tate of the nation, or the &s;tate of the theatre: on the contrary, both the mini&s;ters and the players were &s;uffered to remain in peace; and the only in&s;tance which any of us gave of being alive, was the younge&s;t Mi&s;s Martin, who occa|&s;ionally played with a favourite cat, and once or twice threw down the poker and tongs in the pro|&s;ecution of that pretty amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>SILENCE was, however, at la&s;t broke by Mrs. Martin, who taking out a pocket handkerchief, in &s;everal places was almo&s;t glewed together
<PB N="41" REF="50">
by a certain quantity of &s;nuffy &s;aliva, &s;agaciou&s;ly took notice that the weather was very damp; at the &s;ame time that &s;he made this remark, &s;he pulled the handkerchief out of it's plaits, and held it before the fire to dry, where to do her ju&s;tice, it &s;moaked in &s;uch a manner as evidently &s;upport|ed the propriety of her ob&s;ervation. She had no &s;ooner done this than Mr. Martin, as if he under&s;tood it to be a &s;ignal, began an ince&s;&s;ant coughing, and every other moment di&s;charged large lumps of tough phlegm again&s;t the bars of the &s;tove, which kept up a con&s;tant hi&s;&s;ing like &s;o many &s;au&s;ages in a frying-pan. A concert of this kind I cannot &s;ay was very much to my fancy, &s;o that by the time the &s;ummons came for dinner, I had completely lo&s;t my &s;tomach, and was infinitely more &s;it for a bed than a haunch of veni&s;on.</P>
<P>DURING dinner time, however, matters were rather aggravated than redre&s;&s;ed; Mr. Martin help|ed me with the &s;ame fork that ju&s;t before had been employed in picking his teeth, and his amiable Lady more than once dropped &s;ome of Hardharm's be&s;t Stratzburg among my gravy, though that was a favour which I by no means wi&s;hed for, or &s;olicit|ed; to encrea&s;e my &s;atisfaction, I happen to be a great favourite with two of the young ladies, and gene|rally &s;it between them when I pay a vi&s;it at their father's. In order to &s;hew their attention to me, therefore, whenever I wanted any thing, rather than &s;uffer me to wait an in&s;tant, they kindly
<PB N="42" REF="51">
helped me from their own plates; and Mi&s;s Jenny in particular in&s;i&s;ted, when the footman went down &s;tairs for bread, that I &s;hould take her &s;lice, though it bore the &s;ign of half a dozen teeth, no way remarkable either for their whitene&s;s or regu|larity.</P>
<P>DINNER being at length happily over, I flat|tered my&s;elf that I had gone through the principal fatigue of the day, though had I once taken the trouble of reflecting on the practice of former years, I might have ea&s;ily known I was to &s;uffer &s;ome additional mortifications. The interval between dinner and the hour of tea, was employed in a general invective again&s;t the plague of keeping &s;ervants, in which Mrs. Martin gave notable proofs of a profound dome&s;tic under&s;tanding. This &s;ub|ject I found was perfectly agreeable to the young ladies; they remembered, with the greate&s;t facility, the &s;aucey an&s;wer which their maid Hannah had giv|en on &s;uch a time; how long Edward had &s;taid on &s;uch an errand, and with what a degree of pertne&s;s the cook took her warning on &s;uch an occa&s;ion: to the various parts of this delightful topic, politene&s;s obliged me to an&s;wer with a <HI>very true, madam</HI>; and <HI>you are perfectly right Mi&s;s</HI>; though, at the &s;ame time, I could have almo&s;t wi&s;hed the whole group in a hor&s;e pond, for teizing me with &s;uch a mixture of common place cant and &s;ober malevolence. Whether my friend, Mr. Martin, &s;aw me unea&s;y or no, I cannot an&s;wer, but he luckily de&s;ired that tea might be ordered in, which gave a fre&s;h turn to the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="52">THERE is a practice at the general run of tea tables, for the company to pour the remains of every cup into a particular ba&s;on; and in this com|fortable mixture of &s;lops, the elegance of underbred delicacy always rin&s;es the various cups in the order they are emptied. Mrs. Martin, who values her|&s;elf highly on the proper di&s;charge of the tea table duties, is a warm friend to this delicious cu&s;tom; and always takes care to clean the cup of each in|dividual in the united &s;labberings of the whole. For my part, though I am far from being a nice man, yet I prefer my own dirt to the dirt of other people, and, on that account, endeavour to guard my cup from undergoing &s;o extraordinary a puri|fication wherever I know this mode of rin&s;ing is kept up. Mrs. Martin, however, was not to be eluded&mdash;Under a &s;uppo&s;ition that my backwardne&s;s in this re&s;pect, proceeded from a fear of giving her the lea&s;t trouble, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my cup, with a good natured peremptorine&s;s, and obliged me to pretend a &s;udden pain in the head to avoid the di&s;agreeable con&s;equences of her mi&s;guided civility. Armed with this excu&s;e, I took my leave, not a little happy at &s;o fortunate an e&s;cape, where I was afraid I &s;hould have been obliged to pa&s;s the whole evening.</P>
<P>FROM this little picture, Mr. Babler, your readers may, perhaps, be led to reflect upon the di&s;agreeable &s;hake of a &s;weaty hand; the indeli|cate cu&s;tom of picking one's no&s;e; and the unpar|donable practice of &s;tanding with our backs to
<PB N="44" REF="53">
the fire on a cold day, by which we entirely cut off every po&s;&s;ible beam of warmth from the re&s;t of the company. The&s;e &s;ir, are errors in which the polite&s;t part of our people indulge them&s;elves, as well as the mo&s;t underbred; and they are errors of &s;o di&s;agreeable a nature, that I heartily wi&s;h, for the credit of our country, we would once re&s;olve to &s;hake them off, as they are not only the objects of our own ridicule, but are al&s;o ridiculed by every &s;en&s;ible nation in Europe.</P>

<P>THEODOSIA was the daughter of Gen|tleman in Oxford&s;hire, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;|tate of &s;even hundred pounds a year. Her edu|cation was remarkably elegant, and her per&s;on was &s;uch as procured her a croud of admirers before &s;he was quite eighteen. Among the num|ber who declared them&s;elves openly her lovers, a young Baronet of great fortune made his addre&s;&s;es, and offered &s;ettlements &s;o extremely advantageous, that old Mr. Le&s;tock, her father, immediately gave his concurrence, and a day was &s;et apart for ce|lebrating their nuptials with the greate&s;t magnifi|cence.</P>
<P>IT has been very judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved by an able writer, that there is no time of a woman's
<PB N="45" REF="54">
life &s;o dangerous as the interval between her con|fe&s;&s;ion of an affection for a lover, and the day of her marriage. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being ten|derly beloved, emboldens an admirer to take liber|ties; and the man who but the moment before would have knelt down with all the re&s;pect of the profounde&s;t veneration to reque&s;t the favour of ki&s;&s;ing her hand, will think him&s;elf &s;ufficiently warranted, when &s;he acknowledges that he has a &s;hare in her heart, to dwell upon her lips for an hour, and to loll upon her bo&s;om with the mo&s;t intimate fullne&s;s of familiarity. Be&s;ides this, the freedom of acce&s;s which is always allowed to a man in &s;uch a &s;ituation, furni&s;hes him with numberle&s;s opportunities of repeating his liberties; and even if he goes to indelicate lengths, he knows he can ea&s;ily obtain an excu&s;e from a fond and believing woman, who attributes his very licentiou&s;ne&s;s to the extravagance of his love.</P>
<P>THE truth of this ob&s;ervation was never more fully verified than in the unhappy &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent little narrative. She doated upon Sir Ed|ward Elli&s;on with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s, and could &s;carcely be &s;aid to exi&s;t, but when he was in her company. Naturally &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ofte&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, &s;he would even bur&s;t into a flood of tears, with an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s when &s;he only looked at him attentively, and more than once did &s;he ac|tually &s;ink under the weight of her own tran&s;ports, when he &s;queezed her hand with any great de|great of vehemence, or gave a loo&s;e to the language
<PB N="46" REF="55">
of his love with more than an ordinary &s;hare of fervour and exta&s;y. The mi&s;guided father of the unfortunate young Lady, &s;o far from being con|tinually on his guard again&s;t the dangerous ten|dency of his daughter's affection, rejoiced that he had found a hu&s;band &s;o very much to her ta&s;te; and &s;o far from &s;eeing the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of ne|ver tru&s;ting her any time alone with her lover, left them frequently together after he went to bed, and permitted them to pa&s;s whole hours in the mo&s;t uninterrupted exchange of mutual vows and feli|citations. One fatal Monday night however, about eleven o'clock, the two lovers were by them&s;elves in the back parlour, making up a little quarrel which had happened between them in the begin|ning of the evening. The reciprocal conce&s;&s;ions which this circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;of|tened the bo&s;oms of both, and as in&s;en&s;ibly led the one to offer, and the other to permit, a &s;till en|croaching freedom of care&s;s; at &s;uch a cri&s;is neither rea&s;on nor pride can pre&s;cribe a limit to the pa&s;&s;i|ons, nor take upon them to &s;ay, "thus far will I go and no farther;" in proportion as the tide of tenderne&s;s ari&s;es, both rea&s;on and pride are ab|&s;orbed; and it is no wonder when we &s;uffer &s;uch a &s;acrifice to be made of our under&s;tanding, that we become equally regardle&s;s of our peace and our reputation.</P>
<P>THE morning after this guilty intercour&s;e, when Sir Edward came a little to his recollection, he was di&s;tracted with a variety of different opinions
<PB N="47" REF="56">
relative to Mi&s;s Le&s;tock's behaviour; but though he really loved her as he did his own &s;oul, he at la&s;t concluded with a degree of meanne&s;s pretty com|mon with the generality of his &s;ex, that her weak|ne&s;s was more the effect of a natural incontinence, than the re&s;ult of an exce&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s for him; and therefore he determined to break off all cor|re&s;pondence with her at once, as a woman utterly unworthy the honour of being his wife.</P>
<P>THIS re&s;olution he had no &s;ooner formed than he carried into execution, by di&s;patching a letter to the wretched Mi&s;s Le&s;tock and her father, with the common place aukward apoligies for his be|haviour, and a repeated wi&s;h for the happine&s;s of the lady, though he him&s;elf was taking the only &s;tep which could rob her of happine&s;s for ever: it is as needle&s;s as it is difficult, to paint the di&s;|traction which this unexpected information created in Mr. Le&s;tock's family. Poor Theodo&s;ia now loved the ungenerous baronet with an encrea&s;ed affection. The guilty commerce which had pa&s;&s;ed between them, &s;o far from dimini&s;hing her regard, had given a &s;harper edge than ever to her love, and mingled a &s;ort of phrenzy with her affection, that rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to live in a &s;tate of &s;epa|ration from Sir Edward Elli&s;on; &s;uffice it therefore that, when &s;he heard the purport of his epi&s;tle, &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor, and was conveyed by her father and &s;ome of the &s;ervants to bed, where &s;he continued delirious for four days, in|ce&s;&s;antly raving on her perfidious lover, and rela|ting
<PB N="48" REF="57">
the indi&s;cretion into which he had &s;o unhap|pily drawn her on the preceding Monday evening. In this exigence the unhappy father wrote up to his &s;on, who was a lieutenant in the guards, de|&s;iring to &s;ee him immediately, as an affair had un|expectedly happened, which greatly concerned both the honour and happine&s;s of the family. On the receipt of this letter, captain Le&s;tock in&s;tantly &s;et out, and reached his father's &s;eat in a few hours after.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Le&s;tock was about Sir Edward El|li&s;on's age, ju&s;t twenty-four, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a certain elevation of &s;entiment to which the baronet was a &s;tranger; he was be&s;ides, a young fellow of a temper naturally impetuous and daring, had reduced the various points of honour into an ab|&s;olute &s;y&s;tem; and among the various points of polite education in which he excelled, he was univer&s;ally allowed by his acquaintance to be one of the be&s;t &s;word&s;men in this kingdom. A man of this ca&s;t therefore, was the mo&s;t improper per&s;on in the world to be con&s;ulted in an exigence where the honour of his family and the happine&s;s of his &s;i&s;ter were at &s;take. Mr. Le&s;tock however, was in too di&s;tracted a &s;ituation of mind to give a &s;erious con&s;ideration to con&s;equences: on the contrary, he rather aggravated matters than &s;oftened them; and de&s;ired his &s;on the in&s;tant he came down, to take a ride over to Sir Edward's, to talk to him about his barbarity to Theodo&s;ia; and to per&s;uade him, if po&s;&s;ible, into a performance of tho&s;e en|gagements,
<PB N="49" REF="58">
which formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and his unfortunate daughter.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN LESTOCK &s;carcely heard his father out, than flying to his hor&s;e, he in&s;tantly &s;et off for Sir Edward's, boiling with rage, and deter|mined to call the perfidious baronet to the &s;evere&s;t account, unle&s;s he made the mo&s;t ample &s;atisfaction to his &s;i&s;ter and the whole family. Fraught with &s;entiments of this nature he arrived at Sir Edward's hou&s;e, and found him unluckily at home. At the fir&s;t mention of his name, captain Le&s;tock was ad|mitted; a few minutes however were wa&s;ted in that idle parade of an affected good-breeding, which the cu&s;tom of this country has rendered ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved between the greate&s;t ene|mies. Sir Edward was rejoiced to &s;ee captain Le&s;tock, though he was the only man exi&s;ting whom he would wi&s;h to avoid; and captain Le&s;tock with the mo&s;t obliging &s;olicitude enquired after Sir Edward's health, though he could that moment have taken him by the throat, and &s;acrificed him to the manes of his &s;i&s;ter's murdered reputation.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was proceeded upon; and the captain expre&s;&s;ed his utmo&s;t indignation at the treatment which Theodo&s;ia had received; and hoped the man of honour which Sir Edward had always proved him&s;elf, would immediately repair the injury he had committed, and prevent the di&s;|agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of forcing that per&s;on to be an enemy, who was mo&s;t in the world inclined to be his friend. Captain Le&s;tock pronounced this with a
<PB N="50" REF="59">
tone and manner which were rather a little of the mo&s;t peremptory. No-body could love a &s;i&s;ter with more tenderne&s;s than the captain; his affec|tion therefore mingled with his pride, and his re|&s;entment po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a kind of dignity, which the baronet who was to the full as proud a man as him|&s;elf, could by no means allow; the &s;uperiority which young Le&s;tock &s;eemed to claim upon this occa&s;ion, he therefore an&s;wered with a determined air, that, though he could not pretend to ju&s;tify the part he had acted to mi&s;s Le&s;tock, he never|thele&s;s could not bear to be bullied into any con|ce&s;&s;ions; and would by no means do that at the reque&s;t of her relations, which he did not think proper to perform at her own. An an&s;wer of this nature &s;oon produced very de&s;perate con&s;equences; the captain gave Sir Edward but one alternative, an immediate marriage, or an immediate duel; the baronet accepted of the latter, and in le&s;s than three minutes was left dead on his own floor.</P>
<P>THE news of this affair reached the unfortu|nate Theodo&s;ia, even before the captain him&s;elf returned to his father's; but though that wretched young lady exclaimed again&s;t her perfidious lover in the mo&s;t violent terms, before any mea&s;ure was taken for puni&s;hing him, &s;he was now utterly un|able to bear the news of his death; the remem|brance of his crime, was totally ab&s;orbed in the recollection of his misfortune; the elegance of his per&s;on, the &s;oftne&s;s of his addre&s;s, and the vehe|mence of his pa&s;&s;ion, alone ro&s;e up to her imagi|nation,
<PB N="51" REF="60">
and filled her once more with tenderne&s;s and de&s;pair. In the confu&s;ion therefore which the whole family were in about her brother's &s;afety, &s;he took an opportunity of &s;tabbing her&s;elf with a penknife, and died pronouncing the name of her adored Sir Edward Elli&s;on. The affair however did not terminate here: Captain Le&s;tock was tried for the murder of the baronet, and with much diffi|culty acquitted, while his unhappy father had the gout thrown into his &s;tomach, in con&s;equence of the agitation which he &s;uffered, and was carried off lamenting that he ever had a pa&s;&s;ionate &s;on, or an infatuated daughter.</P>
<P>THE moral which I would deduce from this little &s;tory &s;hall be contained in the following ob|&s;ervations: The generality of people, when the reputaion of a &s;i&s;ter &s;u&s;tains an injury, always look upon them&s;elves as obliged to call the &s;poiler to an account who has thus infamou&s;ly violated her, hon|our without recollecting that the very means which he &s;eeks to redre&s;s her, is the &s;ure&s;t method of rendering her mi&s;erable; and that &s;he would a thou&s;and times &s;ooner &s;ee a dagger plunged into the heart of the man who &s;tands up in her defence, than &s;ee the lea&s;t accident what&s;oever happen to the per&s;on who has &s;o cruelly de&s;troyed the tran|quility of her own. Highly &s;oever as the women rail again&s;t a perfidious lover in the whirlwind of their fury, neverthele&s;s they experience a multi|tude of moments in which the dear deceiver be|comes, if po&s;&s;ible more exqui&s;itely beloved on
<PB N="52" REF="61">
account of his very perfidy, and gains an additional empire over the heart of his injured mi&s;tre&s;s, from the only circum&s;tance in nature which &s;hould en|title him to her everla&s;ting abhorrence and con|tempt. For the&s;e rea&s;ons therefore, I would never advi&s;e a parent or a brother to take a manual re|venge on the man who injures his daughter or his &s;i&s;ter with her own con&s;ent: if &s;he has been weak enough to &s;acrifice her honour, &s;he will be ba&s;e enough to &s;acrifice her family; and therefore no|thing can be more ab&s;urd than to hazard a life in vindication of a woman, who all the time wi&s;hes the per&s;on may be murdered, who generou&s;ly ri&s;es in her behalf, and labours for her redre&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM the daughter of a man of fa&s;hion at the we&s;t end of the town, and have received as liberal an education as my &s;ex would admit of, through the care of the mo&s;t indulgent parents who&s;e principal &s;tudy &s;eems a &s;olicitude for my
<PB N="53" REF="62">
welfare: yet, Sir, though they have taken the ut|mo&s;t pains in the formation of my mind by precept, they &s;et me &s;uch unaccountable examples that if I was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome little fortitude in the ap|plication of their le&s;&s;ons, I might be very apt to &s;hew a perfect unconcern for the mo&s;t rigid they have hitherto endeavoured to in&s;til.</P>
<P>MY father's fir&s;t admonition upon my arriving at any years of di&s;cretion was to warn me again&s;t the libertines of his &s;ex, and above all things, to &s;et the mo&s;t invaluable e&s;teem upon my reputation. Yet, Sir, the very father who gave this advice, is, to my infinite mortification, as free a liver as any of tho&s;e whom he advi&s;ed me to dete&s;t. He has been laying &s;chemes for the &s;eduction of innocence, at a time he has been proving the betrayers of vir|tue to be the mo&s;t infamous of men, and &s;triving to de&s;troy the character of another per&s;on's daugh|ter at the very hour he appeared anxious for the &s;e|curity of his own,</P>
<P>THIS, Sir, is not all: my papa has often lec|tured me to avoid the lea&s;t acquaintance with any man notoriou&s;ly attached to his gla&s;s, declaring, as his po&s;itive opinion, that none but fools or madmen, ever drank to exce&s;s: yet, would you believe, Sir, that he him&s;elf frequently &s;tays out whole nights at the tavern, and particularly piques him&s;elf upon bearing a bottle more than to any of his acquaintance. He has told me to avoid a quar|rel&s;ome man as a pe&s;t to &s;ociety, at the moment he him&s;elf was writing a challenge to a friend, and
<PB N="54" REF="63">
forbad me, on pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure, ever to think of a Newmarket lover, though he never mi&s;&s;es a meeting him&s;elf, and is known to be pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the turf.</P>
<P>MY mamma, Sir, is a truly good woman, but has her incon&s;i&s;tencies too: the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on I receiv|ed from her was to be humble to all my inferiors, and to le&s;&s;en any &s;eeming &s;everity in their &s;tations of life, by &s;hewing the utmo&s;t complacency in mine. Would you think, Sir, that after a docu|ment of this nature, my mamma her&s;elf &s;hould forever in&s;i&s;t upon pre&s;erving her dignity, and look upon it as a derogation if &s;he favoured any of her inferiors with anything more than a con&s;trained interrogation, or a forbidding &s;ort of nod. She has always advi&s;ed me to &s;hew complai&s;ance and conde&s;cen&s;ion to the &s;ervants, though &s;he treats them in a very different manner her&s;elf; and above all things, has in&s;tructed me to avoid &s;atirical reflec|tions on my acquaintance, though &s;he never &s;poke of hers without &s;ome little acidity, &s;ome colour of reprehen&s;ion, or appearance of di&s;like.</P>
<P>CARDS I am under the &s;evere&s;t prohibition of touching, yet my mamma has &s;at up whole nights to my knowledge, at a party at whi&s;t; and I have been taught an aver&s;ion to all finery and parade at a time when her own table has been covered with diamonds, and the room &s;cattered over with pat|terns of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive &s;ilks. In &s;hort, Sir, I have &s;carcely received a le&s;&s;on from my mamma, which her own example has not been calculated to
<PB N="55" REF="64">
de&s;troy; nor a document from my father but what his conduct has turned into contempt. In my religion, as well as the le&s;s important concerns, I receive in&s;tructions which they never practice, and am taught to look up on an ab&s;ence from church as a mo&s;t unpardonable error, though it is &s;even years &s;ince they have appeared at any place of public wor&s;hip them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be thought &s;omething extraor|dinary, Sir, that a daughter &s;hould &s;peak of her parents in a manner &s;o free as I have ju&s;t taken the liberty of doing; but &s;ure it is rather more extra|ordinary of parents to &s;upply the opportunity, and to differ &s;o widely in every in&s;tance of their con|duct from every precept of their advice. Young people, Sir, are but too apt to give into the follies of their time, without having the example of the &s;age and the &s;en&s;ible to keep them in countenance, and it is no way &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould adopt the manners of tho&s;e people whom they have been taught for many years to reverence and e&s;teem. If my notions are honoured with your approbation, Mr. Babler, give this letter a place, and believe me to be, with much re&s;pect, yours,</P>

<P>IT is a fine ob&s;ervation of the very learned and ingenious doctor Gold&s;mith, in the Vicar of Wakefield, an excellent Novel, with which he has lately obliged the public, that though the
<PB N="56" REF="65">
poorer part of mankind may in this world &s;uffer more inconveniencies than the rich, &s;till upon their entrance into another life, the joys of here|after will be enhanced by contra&s;t, in proportion to their afflictions here; and that con&s;equently there can be no room to &s;uppo&s;e the lea&s;t partiality in providence, &s;ince &s;ooner or later tho&s;e who are entitled to it's benignity are certain of meeting with an equal degree of favour from it's hand.</P>
<P>THIS reflexion mu&s;t undoubtedly be con&s;idered as a ma&s;terly vindication of that exterior di&s;parity in the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, at which our modern infidels &s;eem to triumph with &s;o uncea&s;|ing a &s;atisfaction; and it mu&s;t as undoubtedly yield a &s;ublime con&s;olation to the bo&s;om of wretchedne&s;s to think, that if the opulent are ble&s;&s;ed with a con|tinual round of temporal felicity, they &s;hall at lea&s;t experience &s;ome moments of &s;o &s;uperior a rapture in the immediate pre&s;ence of their God, as will fully compen&s;ate for the &s;eeming &s;everity of their former &s;ituations.</P>
<P>YET though there are a variety of calamitous circum&s;tances in which this reflexion mu&s;t admi|ni&s;ter the mo&s;t lively con&s;olation, nevertheles if we make a proper enquiry into the &s;tate of human nature we &s;hall find, that in general the ju&s;tice of providence can be fully vindicated without going to this remote and delicate con&s;ideration. It does not by any means follow, that becau&s;e people are contracted in their fortunes, they &s;hould be wretched in their minds; nor does it by any means
<PB N="57" REF="66">
follow, that the greatne&s;s of their opulence &s;hould be put up as a criterion of their content.</P>
<P>THE principal number of tho&s;e hydraheaded evils with which we perpeutally torment our|&s;elves, are the mere effect of a ridiculous pride, or a narrow under&s;tanding. Actuated by one or the other of the&s;e unfortunate cau&s;es, we are bu&s;y in creating an endle&s;s round of imaginary difficulties, as if the numberle&s;s accidents to which we are naturally expo&s;ed were not in them&s;elves abun|dantly &s;ufficient to imbitter the little &s;pan of our &s;ublunary durations, and to da&s;h the &s;hort-lived moments of &s;atisfaction, with anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE generality of mankind when they take a &s;urvey of the world, are apt to e&s;timate by the gradations of rank the gradations of happine&s;s; hence next to a man with a coach and &s;ix, we think he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the greate&s;t object of envy who keeps a coach and four; after this we rank a chariot and pair, and think that per&s;on in|deed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but a little &s;hare of felicity who can|not afford an hour or two's excur&s;ion in an hum|ble hack, or take an eighteen-penny fare in occa|&s;ional &s;edan.</P>
<P>LOOK on the other &s;ide the &s;cene, and &s;ee how amazingly the picture is altered. The pride of coronetted pomp continually langui&s;hes for the peaceful cottage of ru&s;tic ob&s;curity; and the man who has a hundred downy pillows at his command, imagines that repo&s;e is only to be
<PB N="58" REF="67">
met with in the pea&s;ant's &s;olitary &s;hed. Thus all of us di&s;contented with the lot which we really po&s;&s;e&s;s, and langui&s;hing for the &s;tate with which we are utterly unacquainted, it is no wonder that many incon&s;iderate people endeavour by an act of &s;uicide to throw off the &s;everity of their own yoke, and to get free from a weight of oppre&s;&s;ions which is con&s;tantly becoming more and more in&s;upport|able through the folly of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>YET as in the exten&s;ive round of the mo&s;t elaborate inve&s;tigation, we generally find the rich as di&s;contented with their lot as the poor; we mu&s;t naturally conclude, that the great author of all things has even in this world de&s;igned a pretty equal degree of happine&s;s for his creatures, not|with&s;tanding the evident di&s;parity of their &s;itua|tions. Indeed if we &s;aw felicity in proportion to opulence, or could mea&s;ure the real enjoyments of life by the &s;tandard of rank, we might rea&s;onably imagine that the poor were not to receive their &s;hare of the divine benignity till they were going to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in a glorious eternity; but when we &s;ee that the meane&s;t labourer in the &s;treet reaps as much plea&s;ure over his underbred amu&s;ement as the fir&s;t nobleman in the kingdom can po&s;&s;ibly boa&s;t from the polite&s;t entertainment; and when we &s;ee the fir&s;t make as hearty a dinner on a &s;ingle &s;hin of beef, as the latter ever enjoys at a table of fifty covers, we cannot but &s;uppo&s;e that the com|mon lot of mankind is nearly alike; and that all the impious accu&s;ations which have ari&s;en from
<PB N="59" REF="68">
an imaginary partiality in providence, are the mere re&s;ult of an ignorant pride, or the con&s;equence of an affectation, no le&s;s de&s;tructive to our reputation in this world, than injurious to our felicity in the next.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, however, if we con&s;ider that let our lot in this life be never &s;o &s;evere, it is &s;till infinitely better than what we are entitled to from our own de&s;erts; if we reflect that every ble&s;&s;ing which is &s;howered upon us by the hand of heaven, is a ble&s;&s;ing which proceeds from the exce&s;s of it's own goodne&s;s, and does not ari&s;e from any im|mediate merit in us: I &s;ay, if we con&s;ider the&s;e things with a proper degree of weight, and follow the dictates of that conviction which they mu&s;t in&s;tantly &s;trike upon our minds, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee that till we de&s;erve the favour of exi&s;ting at all, we cannot de&s;erve to have our lives rendered com|fortable in this probationary &s;tate; and that of cour&s;e we ought to be thankful to the Deity for &s;uch in&s;tances of his benignity, as he may think proper to di&s;tingui&s;h us with, in&s;tead of bla&s;phe|mou&s;ly murmuring that he does not honour us with more.</P>

<P>THE term <HI>world</HI> is a word which every body u&s;es to &s;ignify the circle of his own acquaint|ance; and which the meane&s;t plebeian of the
<PB N="60" REF="69">
community has as frequently in his mouth as the greate&s;t per&s;onage in the kingdom. The man of fa&s;hion confines the world entirely to the elegant card-tables, and well-bred a&s;&s;emblies which he frequents. The &s;oldier to the cu&s;tomary licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s in which the gentlemen of the army are indulged; the lawyer to the clamour of We&s;t|mini&s;ter-hall; and the merchant to the mo&s;t dex|trous method of driving a bargain. Thus in fact the world is not the general &s;tate of nature, but the narrow little circle of our own connections; and thus, in&s;tead of judiciou&s;ly endeavouring to extend the &s;canty limits of our knowledge, we mi&s;lead our&s;elves into an opinion that we already know every thing; and &s;ink into an ab&s;olute ig|norance of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points, from an ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition of being perfectly acquainted with them all.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER about thirty years ago, when my old acquaintance Tom Welbank fir&s;t came from the univer&s;ity, that there was &s;carcely a company which he went into for &s;ix months, but what con|&s;idered him as a fool or a madman. Tom lodged at an uncle's near the Hay-market, who lived in a very genteel manner, and frequently &s;aw the be&s;t company. This uncle having no children him&s;elf, had adopted Mr. Welbank as his &s;on; and con|ceiving from the reports which the univer&s;ity of Oxford gave of his nephew's erudition, a very high opinion of the young gentleman's abilities, he made a party on purpo&s;e to di&s;play the talents
<PB N="61" REF="70">
of his boy, who was previou&s;ly advi&s;ed to exert him&s;elf on the occa&s;ion. The company con&s;i&s;ted of two noblemen in the mini&s;try, an eminent di|vine, a celebrated phy&s;ician, a dramatic writer of reputation, the late Mr. Pope, and lady Mary Wortley Montague.</P>
<P>THE time before dinner was pa&s;&s;ed in one of tho&s;e unmeaning random &s;orts of conver&s;ation with which people generally fill up the tedious in|terval to an entertainment; but after the cloth was taken away poor Tom was &s;ingled out by lady Mary, who a&s;ked him with the elegant in|trepidity of di&s;tinction, if he did not think London a much finer place than Oxford. Tom replied, that if her lady&s;hip meant the difference in &s;ize or magnificence of building, there could be no po&s;&s;ibility of a compari&s;on; but if &s;he confined her&s;elf to the fund of knowledge which was to be acquired at either of the places, the advantage lay entirely in favour of Oxford; this reply he deli|vered in a tone confident enough, but rather ele|vated with the dignity of academical declamation; however, it would have pa&s;&s;ed tollerably, had he not endeavoured to blaze out all at once with one of tho&s;e common-place eulogiums on cla&s;&s;ical lite|rature, which we are &s;o apt to meet with in a mere &s;cholar quite raw from an univer&s;ity. In this harangue upon the benefits of education, he ran back to all the celebrated authorities of antiquity, as if the company required any proof of that nature to &s;upport the ju&s;tice of his argument; and did
<PB N="62" REF="71">
not conclude without repeated quotations from the Greek and Latin writers, which he recited with an air of vi&s;ible &s;atisfaction. Lady Mary could not forbear a &s;mile at his earne&s;tne&s;s, and turning about to Mr. Pope, <Q>I think, Sir, (&s;ays &s;he in a half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed whi&s;per) Mr. Welbank is a pretty &s;cholar, but he &s;eems a little unacquainted with the world.</Q> Tom who overheard this whi&s;per was about to make &s;ome an&s;wer, when Mr. Pope a&s;ked him, if there were any new poetical geniu&s;es ri&s;ing at Oxford. Tom upon this &s;eemed to gain new &s;pirits, and mentioned Dick Townly who had wrote an epigram on Chloe; Ned Frod&s;ham who had publi&s;hed an ode to &s;pring; and Harry Knowles who had actually in&s;erted a &s;mart copy of ver&s;es on his bedmaker's &s;i&s;ter, in one of the weekly chronicles. Mr. Pope wheeled about with a &s;ignificant look to lady Mary, and returned the whi&s;per by &s;aying, <Q>I think indeed, madam, that Mr. Welbank does not &s;eem to know a great deal of the world.</Q></P>
<P>ONE of the &s;tatemen &s;eeing Tom rather di&s;|concerted, kindly attempted to relieve him by ex|pre&s;&s;ing a &s;urpri&s;e that &s;o many learned men as compo&s;ed the univer&s;ity of Oxford &s;hould &s;eem &s;o generally di&s;affected to the government. He ob|&s;erved, it was &s;trange that learning &s;hould ever lean to the &s;ide of tyranny; and hinted, that they could never fall into &s;o gro&s;s an error, if in&s;tead of poring perpetually over the works of the an|tients, they now and then took a cur&s;ory dip into
<PB N="63" REF="72">
the hi&s;tory of England. There was a ju&s;tice in this remark which poor Tom being unable an&s;wer, was at a con&s;iderable lo&s;s to with&s;tand; however, thinking him&s;elf obliged to &s;ay &s;omething, he ran out in prai&s;e of all the antient hi&s;torians, and con|cluded with a compliment to the good &s;en&s;e of the univer&s;ity in giving them &s;o proper a preference to the flim&s;ey productions of the moderns. The nobleman turned away with di&s;gu&s;t, and it was the general opinion of the table, that Tom would make a pretty fellow when he knew a little more of the world.</P>
<P>THE deduction which I would make from the foregoing little narrative is, that people before they think them&s;elves acquainted with the world &s;hould endeavour to obtain a general knowledge of men and things, in&s;tead of narrowly drawing their no|tions from any one profe&s;&s;ion, or any particular circle of acquaintance; they may perhaps laugh at all the world, but all the world will be &s;ure of laughing at them; and the general ridicule of every body is much more alarming than the private de|ri&s;ion of any one.</P>

<P>NOTHING is more commonly met with in the world than an affectation of liberality where people are notoriou&s;ly narrow in di&s;po&s;ition; and where captivated with the charms of a ge|nerous
<PB N="64" REF="73">
behaviour, they even force the natural lit|tlene&s;s of their tempers into &s;ome aukward act of reluctant benevolence.</P>
<P>I SUPPED la&s;t night, in con&s;equence of a pre&s;|&s;ing invitation, at the hou&s;e of a gentleman near Pall-mall, who is always endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h a character for genero&s;ity, though there is &s;carcely a circum&s;tance in which he does not manife&s;tly betray the avaricious ca&s;t of his temper, and ex|po&s;e him&s;elf to the contempt of the very per&s;on upon whom he endeavours to confer an obliga|tion.</P>
<P>THERE were eighteen of us at &s;upper, but not the &s;ign of a petticoat in company: our eatables were remarkably elegant: the table was covered with every expen&s;ive rarity of the &s;ea&s;on, and I do not &s;uppo&s;e the expence could be le&s;s from the variety and co&s;t of the di&s;hes, that ten or a dozen pounds. Yet notwith&s;tanding &s;o much magnificence on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, our liquor con&s;i&s;ted of no more than two bottles of &s;our port, a little jar of Welch ale, and a &s;mall bowl of brandy and water: as for lights, though the room was very &s;pacious, we had no more than an humble pair of tallow eights to the pound, which were almo&s;t lo&s;t in a couple of &s;uperb candle&s;ticks, which the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e with an air of negligence informed us, were a great bargain, and had co&s;t him no more than a hundred guineas at Mr. Grim&s;tead's, the great toy&s;hop near St. Paul's.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="74">FOR my own part, there are few people who drink le&s;s claret and burgundy than my&s;elf, or who indeed indulge them&s;elves le&s;s in any extraor|dinary freedoms with the gla&s;s. When a young man I never con&s;idered intoxication as an ap|pendage to gentility; and now that I have ad|vanced pretty far into the vale of years, I &s;hould look upon the &s;malle&s;t exce&s;s to be unpardonable. A grey-headed drunkard is to me a character no le&s;s of abhorrence than contempt: &s;ince he mu&s;t indeed be the wor&s;t of all profligates, who je&s;ts with the mandates of his maker, while he &s;tands tottering on the very verge of eternity. Notwith|&s;tanding this declaration, I mu&s;t acknowledge my|&s;elf extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with the mixture of pa|rade and par&s;imony, which was con&s;picuous in our entertainment. I expected at lea&s;t that matters would have been of a piece; and really wi&s;hed, that a little part of the profu&s;ion which appeared at &s;upper, had been &s;pared to furni&s;h a tollerable bottle of wine for the conclu&s;ion of the evening.</P>
<P>NEXT to great art of regulating our appear|ance either at home or abroad by the &s;tandard of our circum&s;tances, nothing is &s;o &s;ure of maintain|ing us on a re&s;pectable footing with the world, as a con&s;tant uniformity in our dre&s;s and enter|tainments. Should we &s;ee a knight of the garter with his ribband acro&s;s a livery coat, or perceive a man in an embroidered &s;uit of velvet with a dirty pair of wor&s;ted &s;tockings, our ridicule would be very naturally excited, and half the boys in
<PB N="66" REF="75">
town would probably hoot after the fir&s;t as a fool, or the latter as a madman. In like manner tho&s;e who give fifty covers at an entertainment, &s;hould make a proportionable figure in the choice of their wines; and tho&s;e for ever avoid burgundy and champaign, who treat with nothing more than a &s;imple veal cutlet, or an humble beef &s;take.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t extraordinary mixtures of par&s;imony and parade, whom I ever remember to have known, was poor Jack Greedy; Jack made it a con&s;tant point to take four box tickets in public company, for the late Mr. Ryan's benefit, declaring his high regard for the character of that worthy man, but always demanding the odd &s;hilling out of the guinea. If any of his friends wanted a &s;um of money, he never &s;crupled to lend it with|out intere&s;t, though at the &s;ame time he teized them everla&s;tingly with what it would produce in the funds. No gold did he ever give in charity, but what was con&s;iderably deficient in weight: and once when he made his borough a pre&s;ent of a town clock, he charged the corporation with the carriage from London. Thus doing things continually by halves, and de&s;troying, with a per|petual attention to the mere&s;t trifles, all the merit which he gained from the di&s;tribution of large &s;ums, he &s;unk into univer&s;al contempt, and &s;quan|dered away the principal part of his fortune to procure the character of a mi&s;er.</P>
<P>HIS neighbour, hone&s;t Will Frankly, was a man of quite a contrary temper, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="67" REF="76">
of &s;carcely half his fortune by doing things with a good grace, he obtained more applau&s;e from the di&s;po&s;al of a &s;hilling, than the other did from a gift of fifty pounds. There was &s;ome|thing generou&s;ly uno&s;tentatious about him, that gave the &s;malle&s;t act of benevolence an air of dig|nity; and by never &s;eeming to demand the ad|miration of his friends, he was always certain of enjoying it. To Mr. Greedy the village gave no|thing more than a di&s;tant bow of unwilling re|&s;pect; but to Mr. Frankly they were officiou&s;ly forward to pull off their hats, and gazed at him till he was out of &s;ight, with an air of vi&s;ible &s;atis|faction. Upon the whole, they were two &s;triking proofs of the wi&s;e man's ob&s;ervation, that he who does a good action merely for the &s;ake of virtue is always &s;ure of that applau&s;e from the world, which the o&s;tentatious man con&s;tantly lo&s;es, by aiming to rai&s;e his own reputation.</P>

<P>THERE is a &s;entiment in Mr. Coleman's comedy of the Jealous Wife, with which I am not a little plea&s;ed, as it is no le&s;s an indication of a benevolent heart than a &s;ound under&s;tanding. Harriet reproaching young Oakley on account of his extraordinary attachment to the bottle; the lover &s;en&s;ibly &s;truck with the ju&s;tice of the reproof,
<PB N="68" REF="77">
exclaims that were all ladies alike attentive to the morals of their admirers, a libertine would be an uncommon character.</P>
<P>INDEED if we take but ever &s;o &s;light a view of the &s;exes, we &s;hall find the behaviour of the one to depend &s;o entirely upon the opinion of the other, that was either to &s;et about a reformation, the amendment of both would be ea&s;ily affected, and tho&s;e virtues would be immediately cultivated through the prevalence of fa&s;hion, which neither the force of conviction, the dread of temporary misfortune, nor the terrors of everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, are now &s;ufficient to &s;teal upon our practice, even while they engage our veneration.</P>
<P>AS the ladies in general are more affected by the prevalence of immorality than the men; it often &s;urpri&s;es me, that they do not endeavour to look tho&s;e vices out of countenance among our &s;ex, which are &s;o frequently fatal to their own tranquility. A man, through the e&s;tabli&s;hment of cu&s;tom, con&s;iders it as infamous to marry a pro|&s;titute, to connect him&s;elf with a drunkard, or to pay his addre&s;&s;es to a woman who&s;e lips are con|tinually fraught with indecency or execration; though accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to the midnight exce&s;&s;es of the &s;tew, yet when he fixes for life, he enquires into the character of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and pro&s;ecutes his &s;uit in proportion as &s;he is eminent for her virtues. Her follies he readily laughs at, but over|looks by no means the &s;malle&s;t want of reputation. Whereas the lady, though bred up all her life in
<PB N="69" REF="78">
the &s;tricte&s;t delicacy, expre&s;&s;es no repugnance what|&s;oever to venture with the mo&s;t public betrayer of innocence, the mo&s;t open enemy of mankind, and the mo&s;t daring defier of his God. Nay, unle&s;s he has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure remarkable for the number and blackne&s;s of his vices, &s;he holds him in contempt, and &s;ets him down as an ab&s;olute ideot, if he is not intimately conver&s;ant with every thing that can either le&s;&s;en him as a chri&s;tian, or degrade him as a man.</P>
<P>WHAT, however, is mo&s;t extraordinary on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is the facility with which a father u&s;ually contracts his daughter to a libertine; as if becau&s;e cu&s;tom did not involve her in the infamy of his character, his habitual propen&s;ity to vice mu&s;t not nece&s;&s;arily endanger her happine&s;s. For my own part, I am &s;hocked when I &s;aw a parent le&s;s regardful of a daughter's felicity, than atten|tive to the welfare of a &s;on. Is there a father who would per&s;uade his &s;on into a marriage with a pro&s;titute profe&s;&s;ed? I hope not; why then is his daughter &s;o relentle&s;sly &s;acrificed to a libertine? Is there not as much danger for the one to be mi&s;erable with her hu&s;band, as the other to be wretched with his wife? And &s;ince the natural claim to paternal indulgence is equal between each, mu&s;t it not be highly inequitable to treat the fir&s;t with &s;uch an exce&s;s of unmerited partiality?</P>
<P>I AM in&s;en&s;ibly led into this &s;ubject from a peru&s;al of &s;ome &s;ermons, addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>young women,</HI> which have lately made their appearance, and were
<PB N="70" REF="79">
ye&s;terday put into my hands by my book&s;eller. Who the author is I know not, but he de&s;erves the greate&s;t encomiums, for the per&s;picuity of his &s;tile, and the energy of his arguments; he is elegant without levity, and pious without affectation. In one of his di&s;cour&s;es, where <HI>famale virtue</HI> is the object of con&s;ideration, he gives &s;o admirable a le&s;&s;on to the &s;ex on account of this unhappy approbation with which the very be&s;t women &s;o frequently honour a profligate lover, that I cannot but tran|&s;cribe it for the benefit of my amiable readers.</P>
<P><Q>HOW common is it to &s;ee young ladies, who pa&s;s for women of reputation, admitting into their company in public places, and that with vi&s;ible tokens of civility and plea&s;ure, men, whom the moment before they &s;aw herding with creatures of infamous name! &mdash; Gracious God, what a defiance to the laws of piety, prudence, character, decorum! what an in&s;ult, in effect, to every man and woman of virtue in the world! what a palpable encouragement to vice and di&s;honour! what a de&s;perate pulling down, in appearance, and with their own hands, of the only partition that divides them from the mo&s;t profligate of their &s;ex! between the bold and the abandoned woman there may &s;till remain, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch behaviour, a di&s;tinction in the world's eye; but we &s;cruple not to declare, that religion, purity, delicacy, make none.</Q></P>
<P><Q>TO return from this digre&s;&s;ion, if it be one, we will allow it po&s;&s;ible to put ca&s;es wherein no
<PB N="71" REF="80">
particular rules of di&s;covery, no determinate modes of judgment, will enable a young woman, by her own una&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;kill, to di&s;cern the dangers that lie in her way. But can a young woman be ju&s;tly excu&s;ed, or can &s;he fairly excu&s;e her|&s;elf, if, where all is at &s;take, &s;he calls not in the joint aid of wi&s;e &s;u&s;picion, friendly coun&s;el, and grave experience, together with prayers for God's protection more than ordinarily &s;ervent?</Q></P>
<P><Q>BUT, methinks, I heard &s;ome of you a&s;k with an air of earne&s;t curio&s;ity, Do not reformed rakes then make the be&s;t of hu&s;bands? I am &s;orry for the que&s;tion, I am doubly &s;orry, whenever it is &s;tarted by a virtuous woman. I will not wound the ear of mode&s;ty by drawing minutely the cha|racter of a rake: but give me leave to an&s;wer your enquiry, by a&s;king a que&s;tion or two in my turn. In the fir&s;t place, we will &s;uppo&s;e a man of this character actually reformed, &s;o far as to treat the woman he marries with every mark of tenderne&s;s, e&s;teem, fidelity; and that he gives up for ever his old companions, at lea&s;t as to any cho&s;en intimacy, or preference of their company to hers. We grant it po&s;&s;ible; we rejoice when it happens. It is certainly the be&s;t atonement that can be made for his former conduct.

How any of you may feel on this &s;ubject, I cannot &s;ay.

<P>THOUGH I have more than once in the cour&s;e of my little animadver&s;ions, endea|voured to explode the prepo&s;terous cu&s;tom of toa&s;t|ing, yet I have within this week met a circum|&s;tance which has, if po&s;&s;ible, encrea&s;ed my aver&s;ion
<PB N="74" REF="83">
to the practice, and in a manner compelled me to re&s;ume the &s;ubject, however tedious the repetition may appear to &s;ome of my <HI>bon-vivant</HI> readers.</P>
<P>I DINED accidently a few days ago at a well-known coffee-hou&s;e in the Strand, at the pre&s;&s;ing reque&s;t of my nephew Harry, who a&s;&s;ured me that the company would be highly to my ta&s;te, for though the mo&s;t of them were young fellows, yet there were very few by whom they were &s;urpa&s;&s;ed either in politene&s;s or under&s;tanding. This a&s;&s;u|rance, joined to the regard which I always enter|tain for my boy's conver&s;ation, induced me to give a very ready acquie&s;cence, and it is no more than ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that Harry had not over rated the merit of his friends, notwith&s;tanding the latitude of the foregoing character.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY, however, ju&s;t as we were circu|lating our jokes with the utmo&s;t good-humour, two or three gentlemen belonging to the army, who were intimately acquainted with &s;ome of our company, and overheard us from an adjoining room, &s;ent in their compliments, and begged per|mi&s;&s;ion to join us, if we were not engaged about any particular bu&s;ine&s;s. This reque&s;t was urged in too polite a manner to be refu&s;ed, and we ac|cordingly &s;ent word how much we thought our|&s;elves obliged by &s;o friendly a propo&s;ition. The addition to our company &s;carcely took place, when one of the mo&s;t manly and &s;en&s;ible characters I ever conver&s;ed with, made his appearance pur&s;uant to a promi&s;e which he had given to my Harry,
<PB N="75" REF="84">
attended by two young gentlemen, his &s;ons, the elde&s;t of whom did not &s;eem to be quite eighteen. As the &s;tranger carried a con&s;iderable degree of con&s;equence in his very looks, he was received with a &s;uitable re&s;pect, and conver&s;ation began to circulate even with an additional &s;hare of life, when our harmony was illiberally interrupted by a toa&s;t from one of the gentlemen in red, no le&s;s offen&s;ive to good-&s;en&s;e, than repugnant to good manners. I &s;tarted with an equal mixture of &s;ur|pri&s;e and indignation; but there was no de&s;cribing the &s;ituation of Harry's friend, or the di&s;tre&s;s of the mode&s;t youths who accompanied him. The father &s;eemed totally aba&s;hed at the company into which he introduced his &s;ons; and the &s;ons utterly unaccu&s;tomed to &s;o lice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ious an example, were quite unable to hold up their heads; they &s;unk with confu&s;ion as if they had actually given an offence, in&s;tead of having received one; till entirely at a lo&s;s how to recover them&s;elves they &s;en&s;ibly with|drew, and left the grown gentlemen to indulge them&s;elves with ill-breeding and ob&s;cenity.</P>
<P>AMONG the numberle&s;s ab&s;urdities which, in this happy country, are kept up among our men of &s;en&s;e, the cu&s;tom of confining vice to the ages of di&s;cretion is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary. A per&s;on now-a-days is not allowed to be a pro|fligate till he arrives at one and twenty; as if, in proportion to the encrea&s;e of his under&s;tanding, he was to act diametrically repugnant to the prin|ciples of decency and virtue. An uninformed
<PB N="76" REF="85">
&s;tripling mu&s;t by no means, either pre&s;ume to &s;wear, or talk &s;muttily; his father will correct him &s;everely for the licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and he will be looked upon with contempt or abhorrence by all his acquaint|ance. The father him&s;elf however may utter the mo&s;t &s;hocking bla&s;phemies, and ran&s;ack the &s;tews for the redde&s;t ob&s;cenities of a brutal imagination. He is old enough to know the profligacy of the practice; and is &s;en&s;ible how offen&s;ive it is both to politene&s;s and religion, to the laws of his country, and the ordinances of his God.</P>
<P>I HAVE been often &s;urpri&s;ed that in a nation which values it&s;elf &s;o ju&s;tly upon the character of it's good &s;en&s;e, there &s;hould be &s;till &s;uch palpable remains of barbarity; what can be a greater re|flexion either on our morals or our breeding, than the cu&s;tom of driving our wives and children out of the room immediately after dinner, and telling them we are going to begin a conver&s;ation which is utterly improper for their ears. Shall men, who pretend either to manners or to virtue, enter upon &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es as are dangerous to their children, or &s;hocking to their wives! &s;hall it be &s;aid that a child is not to be tru&s;ted with his own father, for fear of being corrupted; nor a woman permitted to enjoy a &s;ocial hour with her own hu&s;band, for fear of &s;ome palpable affront. &mdash; Yes it mu&s;t be &s;aid &mdash; yes it mu&s;t be mentioned to the everla&s;ting di&s;grace of the civilized people of Eng|land, that they are utterly unable to pa&s;s an even|ing without the mo&s;t infamous indulgence of ob|&s;enity
<PB N="77" REF="86">
and execration; and that the happine&s;s of their convivial entertainments is always e&s;timated in proportion, as they deba&s;e the dignity of their under&s;tandings, and violate the mandates of their God.</P>
<P>A VERY laudable a&s;&s;ociation has been lately &s;et on foot in &s;everal places of this kingdom, to rai&s;e the wages of our hone&s;t &s;ervants, and to aboli&s;h the inho&s;pitable cu&s;tom of making our friends continually pay for their entertainment. Infinitely would it be to the honour of tho&s;e gentlemen who &s;o generou&s;ly exert them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of ho&s;|pitality, if they al&s;o &s;tood up in defence of true politene&s;s and real virtue. Di&s;&s;ipated as the pre|&s;ent age is, a few examples would produce an uni|ver&s;al reformation; and I dare be bold enough to affirm, that the purpo&s;es of rational fe&s;tivity would be much better an&s;wered, &s;hould &s;uch a regulation happily take place; when men begin to throw off decency, they &s;oon throw off all e&s;teem for one another; and few retain any regard for their friends, when they wantonly &s;acrifice every con|&s;ideration for them&s;elves. Whereas by an ob|servance of good-breeding we &s;hould always main|tain our friend&s;hips, and enjoy what Pope finely calls
<Q>The fea&s;t of rea&s;on and the flow of &s;oul,</Q>
Where we are now filled with di&s;gu&s;t, or &s;unk into all the exce&s;&s;es of brutality.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW few &s;ubjects more written upon and le&s;s under&s;tood than that of friend&s;hip; to follow the dictates of &s;ome, this virtue, in&s;tead of being the a&s;&s;wager of pain, becomes the &s;ource of every inconvenience. Such &s;peculati&s;ts, by expecting too much from friend&s;hip, di&s;&s;olve the connection; and by drawing the bands too clo&s;ely, at length break them. Almo&s;t all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they per&s;uade us to friend|&s;hips which we find impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain to the la&s;t; &s;o that this &s;weetner of life under proper regulations, is by their means rendered inacce&s;&s;ible or unea&s;y.</P>
<P>IT is certain the be&s;t method to cultivate this virtue, is by letting it in &s;ome mea&s;ure make it&s;elf. A &s;imilitude of minds or &s;tudies, and even &s;ome|times a diver&s;ity of pur&s;uits will produce all the plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from it. The current of ten|derne&s;s widens as it proceeds, and two men im|perceptibly find their hearts warm with good-nature for each other, when they were at fir&s;t only in pur&s;uit of mirth or relaxation. Friend&s;hip is like a debt of honour, the moment it is talked of it lo&s;es its real name, and a&s;&s;umes the more ungrate|ful form of obligation.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="88">FROM hence we find that tho&s;e who regularly undertake to cultivate friend&s;hip, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of beings which dependance gathers round us is al|mo&s;t ever unfriendly; they &s;ecretly wi&s;h the terms of their connection more nearly equal, and where they even have the mo&s;t virtue are prepared to re&s;erve all their affections for their patron only in the hour of his decline. Encrea&s;ing the obliga|tions which are laid upon &s;uch minds only encrea&s;es their burthen; they feel them&s;elves unable to repay the immen&s;ity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent re&s;entment at the hand that is &s;tretched out with offers of &s;ervice and relief.</P>
<P>PLAUTINUS was a man who thought that every good was to be bought by riches, and as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great wealth, and had a mind naturally formed for virtue, he re&s;olved to gather a circle of the be&s;t men round him. Among the number of his dependants was Mu&s;idorus, with a mind ju&s;t as fond of virtue, yet not le&s;s proud than his pa|tron. His circum&s;tances, however, were &s;uch as forced him to &s;toop to the good offices of his &s;upe|rior, and he &s;aw him&s;elf daily among a number of others loaded with benefits, and prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip. The&s;e in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the world he thought it prudent to accept, but while he gave his e&s;teem he could not give his heart. A want of affection breaks out in the mo&s;t trifling in&s;tances, and Plautinus had &s;kill enough to ob&s;erve the mi|nute&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="89">
actions of the man he wi&s;hed to make his friend. In the&s;e he ever found his aim di&s;appoint|ed, for Mu&s;idorus claimed an exchange of hearts, which Plautinus &s;oliciting by a variety of other claims could never think of be&s;towing. It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed that the re&s;erve of our poor proud man was &s;oon con&s;trued into ingratitude, and &s;uch indeed in the common acceptation of the world it was. Wherever Mu&s;idorus appeared, he was re|marked as the <HI>ungrateful man</HI>; he had accepted favours it was &s;aid, and &s;till had the in&s;olence to pretend to independence. The event however, ju&s;ti&s;ied his conduct. Plautinus by mi&s;placed libe|rality at length became poor, and it was then that Mu&s;idorus fir&s;t thought of making a friend of him. He flew to the man of fallen fortune with an offer of all he had; wrought under his direction with a&s;&s;iduity; and by uniting their talents both were at length placed in that &s;tation of life from which one of them had formerly fallen.</P>
<P>TO this &s;tory taken from modern life, I &s;hall add one more taken from a Greek writer of anti|quity. Two Jewi&s;h &s;oldiers in the times of Ve&s;|pa&s;ian had made many campaigns together, and a participation of danger at length bred an union of hearts. They were remarked throughout the whole army as the two friendly brothers; they felt, and fought for each other. Their friend&s;hip might have continued without interruption till death, had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be a
<PB N="81" REF="90">
General under the famous John, who headed a particular party of the Jewi&s;h malecontents. From this moment their former love was converted into the mo&s;t inveterate enmity. They attached them|&s;elves to oppo&s;ite factions, and &s;ought each others lives in the conflict of adver&s;e party. In this man|ner they continued for more than two years, vow|ing mutual revenge, and animated with an uncon|querable &s;pirit of aver&s;ion. At length, however, that party of the Jews, to which the mean &s;oldier belonged, joining with the Romans, it became victorious, and drove John with all his adherents into the temple. Hi&s;tory has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that &s;uperb edifice. The Roman &s;oldiors were gather|ed round it; the whole temple was in flames, and thou&s;ands were &s;een burning alive within it's cir|cuit. It was in this &s;ituation of things that the now-&s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldier &s;aw his former friend upon the battlements of the highe&s;t tower, looking round with horror, and ju&s;t ready to be con&s;umed with flames. All his former tenderne&s;s now there|fore he returned; he &s;aw the man of his bo&s;om ju&s;t going to peri&s;h; and unable to with&s;tand the impul&s;e, he ran &s;preading his arms, and crying out to his friend, to leap down from the top, and find &s;afety with him. The friend from above heard and obeyed, and ca&s;ting him&s;elf from the top of the tower into his fellow &s;oldier's arms, both fell a &s;acrifice on the &s;pot; one being cru&s;hed to death by the weight of his companion, and the other be|ing da&s;hed to pieces by the greatne&s;s of his fall.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE generality of young women when once they get a lover in their heads, imagine that their relations are the mo&s;t cruel creatures in the world, unle&s;s they give an immediate con&s;ent to every ab&s;urdity of their inclinations, and be&s;tow them at once with a con&s;iderable fortune upon the &s;weet fellow who has thus happily made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their affections. If a parent pretends to any authority, he in&s;tantly, from a tender father is looked upon as an ab&s;olute tyrant; and pretty mi&s;s very dutifully wi&s;hes him fifty fathom under ground, that &s;he may have a hand&s;ome &s;um of money to throw away upon a ra&s;cal, whom &s;he has not po&s;&s;ibly known above a month or &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>I AM you mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, a mi&s;erable woman, whom a partialiry of this nature for a mo&s;t infamous villain, has plunged into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. About five years ago, Sir, I lived with my father, a beneficed clergyman in the north of England, and had every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied, that the happine&s;s of the venerable old gentleman's life was placed in mine, from the exce&s;&s;ive ten|derne&s;s with which he con&s;tantly treated me, and
<PB N="83" REF="92">
from the enjoyments of which he debarred him&s;elf, merely to lay up a fortune for my advancement in the world. I was his only child; and though my mother died while I was quite an infant, he never would alter his condition, for fear, as he kindly expre&s;&s;ed it, he might place a very different &s;ort of woman over his poor I&s;abella.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;carcely turned my twenty-fir&s;t year, Mr. Babler, when a company of &s;trolling players came into our neighbourhood, a principal of which being an excellent &s;cholar, and ma&s;ter of a very genteel addre&s;s, had a letter of recommendation to my father, from a brother clergyman in the la&s;t town where they exhibited. My father, who was benevolence it&s;elf, though he did not greatly ap|prove of &s;uch a gue&s;t, neverthele&s;s de&s;ired him out of compliment to his friend to &s;tay dinner, and a&s;&s;ured him of his be&s;t &s;ervices whenever the be|nefits came to be adverti&s;ed. Mr. Villars, the comedian, thanked him in a hand&s;ome manner, and we &s;oon after &s;at down to table, where the de&s;igning hypocrite, by a behaviour the mo&s;t &s;pe|cious and polite; and by an una&s;&s;uming pretence to all the virtues with which he was utterly un|acquainted, &s;oon got the better of my father's re|&s;erve, and not a little &s;ilenced the contempt which I had always entertained for tho&s;e itinerant de|pendents on the theatre. Not to be minutely cir|cum&s;tantial, &s;uffice it, Mr. Babler, that Villars received an invitation no le&s;s warm than general to our hou&s;e, and in le&s;s than a week made &s;uch
<PB N="84" REF="93">
good u&s;e of my father's ho&s;pitality, as entirely to captivate the affections of his inexperienced daugh|ter, and to fill her with an in&s;uperable aver&s;ion to the happy habitation, in which for her whole life &s;he had been &s;o carefully brought up.</P>
<P>I WAS too much a novice, however, in the bu|&s;ine&s;s of amour, to keep the matter &s;o perfectly concealed from the eyes of a father, who in his youth had been remarkably well received among the ladies, as I could wi&s;h: he &s;aw with what eagerne&s;s I hung upon every &s;yllable that fell from Villars, and remarked with concern, that unle&s;s Villars was in the hou&s;e I &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided his company. One Sunday afternoon, therefore, while I imagined he was at church, he unexpected darted from a clo&s;et in the very room where Villars and I were exchanging vows of everla&s;ting fidelity; and ordering my lover with a look of indignation never to come again into his pre&s;ence, de&s;ired me immediately to retire to my room.</P>
<P>THOUGH &s;hame and confu&s;ion kept me &s;ilent in the pre&s;ence of my father, I was neverthele&s;s no &s;ooner alone, than I began to think his be|haviour a very unju&s;tifiable piece of barbarity: all the care and anxiety which for more than twenty years he had manife&s;ted for my welfare, was im|mediately bani&s;hed from my remembrance. I looked upon him as the greate&s;t enemy I had in the world; and full of nothing but the idea of my adorable Villars, I determined, like the incon&s;i|derate the unnatural mon&s;ter I was, to quit the
<PB N="85" REF="94">
man who gave me being, who educated me with the nice&s;t circum&s;pection, and of who&s;e worth I was perfectly convinced; to go off with a fellow, who for ought I knew might be a highwayman; to whom I never owed an obligation; and who&s;e per&s;on I had never &s;een till the week before, in which he &s;o unfortunately brought a recommenda|tion to my father's.</P>
<P>BEFORE I had time to execute this dutiful pro|ject however, my unhappy father came up to my room, and looking at me for &s;ome time with an air of inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, at la&s;t bur&s;t into a flood of tears. When he had &s;omewhat recovered him|&s;elf. <Q>O I&s;abella, &s;aid he, little did I think to have &s;een &s;uch a day as this; and little did I imagine you would ever give me cau&s;e to regret the hour of your birth. In what part of my duty, tell me child, has there been a deficiency to occa&s;ion &s;o fatal a negligence in yours? What has your father done, that you wi&s;h to &s;hake off every &s;entiment of nature and affection; and de&s;ire to fly from the arms which have che|ri&s;hed you &s;ince the fir&s;t moment of your ex|i&s;tence, to refuge with a villain, whom you have not known above ten or a dozen days. In the alienation of your affections, has he he&s;itated to break the &s;acred laws of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pita|lity, or &s;crupled to put on the awful form of virtue to pro&s;ecute the mo&s;t infamous ends? While I entertained him with the greate&s;t cor|diality, he was doing me the mo&s;t irreparable
<PB N="86" REF="95">
injury; and when I harboured him mo&s;t in my bo&s;om, like the venemous adder, the more deeply he &s;tung me to the heart. And will you, I&s;abella, in&s;tead of revenging the cau&s;e of &s;o in|jured, and I hope I may &s;ay, &s;o tender a parent, become your&s;elf acce&s;&s;ary to the de&s;truction of my happine&s;s; will you be guilty of a parricide to reward an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who has attempted more than my life; and &s;hall it be &s;aid that a common place compliment to her beauty is of more con|&s;ideration to &s;o &s;en&s;ible a young lady than the everla&s;ting tranquillity of her father? Alas, my child, let not your youth and inexperience lead you into an irretrievable mi&s;take. The man that would be guilty of a crime to engage your affections, would not &s;top at a crime to ca&s;t you off, when time and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had rendered you le&s;s attractive to his imagination. Con&s;ider my dear, the man who courts you to quit your father's hou&s;e, is intere&s;ted in his &s;olicitations, I cannot be intere&s;ted. He wants you to gratify his <HI>own</HI> purpo&s;es; whereas I have no end to an|&s;wer but the advancement of <HI>your</HI> felicity, and am willing to contract every enjoyment of my life, for the &s;ake of building that felicity on a permanent foundation. As I am determined never to lay a re&s;train upon your inclinations, weigh well the advice I have given you. You are now a woman by the laws of the land, and your per&s;on is at your own di&s;po&s;al: if therefore to-morrow morning, after having maturely con|&s;idered
<PB N="87" REF="96">
the affair, you can &s;acrifice your doating father, for this inho&s;pitable villain, pack up your cloaths and every thing el&s;e which belongs to you; go and favour him with your hand at the altar of that God who &s;ees into the bottom of my afflictions, and do not incur the additional di&s;grace, of an infamous flight from a hou&s;e in which you have been treated with &s;uch a con|tinued exce&s;s of paternal indulgence. Remem|ber, however, if &s;uch &s;hould be your re&s;olution, that I am no more your father; in humble imi|tation of the Deity, by whom I hope to be for|given, I here offer you a chearful forgivene&s;s for what is pa&s;t. But if you per&s;evere, know that though my humanity may weep for your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that my ju&s;tice will never permit me to reward it.</Q></P>
<P>MY father after this de&s;ired me to recollect, that I was far from being de&s;titute of admirers, that three or four young gentlemen of agreeable per&s;ons, unexceptionable character, and hand&s;ome fortunes, had for a con&s;iderable time paid their addre&s;&s;es; and that con&s;equently I could not have even the ridiculous plea of being <HI>neglected,</HI> to palliate my attachment for the object whom I had &s;o pre|po&s;terou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed by my choice. Saying this he left me with an air of dejected re&s;olution; and taking his hor&s;e rode off a few miles to the hou&s;e of an intimate acquaintance, where he lay that night, as if he was unwilling to throw the

&s;hadow of an impediment in the way of my deter|mination.</P>
<P>IT is no ea&s;y circum&s;tance to de&s;cribe the &s;itu|ation of my heart at this behaviour of my father's: he convinced my rea&s;on, but at the &s;ame time he alarmed my pride; and I ab&s;urdly imagined, that it would be a derogation from my own dignity if I offered to make him the lea&s;t conce&s;&s;ions, after he had thus indirectly commanded me to quit his hou&s;e. Pre&s;umption is always the daughter of in|dulgence; where children have been treated with an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s, they mo&s;t commonly think it very in&s;olent in a parent if he happens to tell them of any little mi&s;take; and are wonderfully ready to expect a mo&s;t punctual performance of his duty, however remi&s;s they them&s;elves may be in the di&s;charge of their own. Unhappilly for me, I was one of the&s;e hopeful children; ac|cu&s;tomed to nothing but the heart-directed blan|di&s;hments of paternal affection, I could not bear the accent of reproach, though con&s;cious of it's be|ing merited; and thought that my father &s;hould have made me a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive apology, though it certainly would have done me the greate&s;t credit if I had fallen at his feet, and implored his forgive|ne&s;s with a torrent of tears.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus agitated between the &s;ober remon&s;trances of my rea&s;on, and the unnatural workings of my pride, Villars; who had waited at a little alehou&s;e in the neighbourhood, to watch the motions of our family, no &s;ooner &s;aw my
<PB N="89" REF="98">
father's back, than he boldly came up to the hou&s;e, and pre&s;t me in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate manner to em|brace that opportunity of packing up my little all and e&s;caping from the tyranny of a man, who made no other u&s;e of his authority than to render me perpetually mi&s;erable. &mdash; <Q>Parents, my charm|ing Mi&s;s Brandon, (&s;aid the artful villain) ima|gine they do mighty things if they give a young lady a decent room, a tolerable gown, and treat her now and then with a box at the theatre; this they call an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s, and think a very meritorious di&s;charge of their duty; but &s;ee the &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency of their characters; though they &s;o readily allow her to plea&s;e her|&s;elf in little things, yet they ab&s;olutely deny her a will in the mo&s;t material article of all, and permit the mere amu&s;ement of an hour, with no other view but to claim &s;uch an authority over her inclinations as may render her mi&s;erable for life.</Q> The&s;e &s;entiments, Mr. Babler, joined to the fa&s;cinating importunity of the fellow, did my bu&s;ine&s;s compleatly; I &s;et about packing up my cloaths and trinkets in an in&s;tant, and in le&s;s than two hours was entirely out of &s;ight, glowing all the way with a revengeful &s;ort of &s;atisfaction, to think how mortified my father mu&s;t be when he found I had &s;o chearfully taken him at his word.</P>
<P>AS it would not be prudent for Mr. Villars to &s;tay in the neighbourhood when our affair became any way public, we quitted the country with the utmo&s;t expedition, and by the following evening
<PB N="90" REF="99">
arrived at a con&s;iderable town near an hundred miles off, in which a &s;trolling company was at that time performing, from whom Mr. Villars had re|ceived &s;everal very pre&s;&s;ing letters, reque&s;ting him to join them, and offering him by much the mo&s;t capital ca&s;t of all the characters. At this place we were married the morning after our arrival; and to my everla&s;ting infamy I mention it, no one reflexion of what might be felt at home, was once &s;uffered to di&s;credit the fe&s;tival with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>I HAD not however been many weeks married before I found a very material alteration in the be|haviour of my hu&s;band; in&s;tead of the good hu|mour and complai&s;ance which he formerly a&s;&s;umed, he treated me with nothing but a round of the mo&s;t &s;ilent &s;urline&s;s, or the mo&s;t &s;arca&s;tic con|tempt. If he talked &s;ometimes, it was of having thrown him&s;elf away; and in proportion as our circum&s;tances became contracted, for the players had but very little bu&s;ine&s;s, and the principal part of my wardrobe was now di&s;po&s;ed of, he was ba&s;e enough even to reproach me with running away from my father. I now &s;aw when it was too late, the imprudence of my conduct, and would have given the world had I been mi&s;tre&s;s of it, to call back the days of my former tranquility. I per|ceived clearly that Villar's &s;ole motive in ever ad|dre&s;&s;ing me, was the con&s;ideration of my father's opulence; he &s;aw me an only child, and naturally imagined, that though the venerable old gentle|man might be offended with me at fir&s;t, he would
<PB N="91" REF="100">
neverthele&s;s quickly relent, and take me again to the arms of his affection, as a daughter. With this view he obliged me to &s;end home letters upon letters, all expre&s;&s;ing the deepe&s;t penitence for my fault, and painting the wretchedne&s;s of our &s;ituation in colours the mo&s;t affecting. A po&s;t &s;carcely went for &s;everal weeks, but what caried &s;ome petition of this nature; and perhaps I might have continued writing con&s;iderably longer, had not the following note been at la&s;t &s;ent, in an&s;wer to my various epi&s;tles.</P>

<P>THIS letter, which my con&s;cience convinced me was what I ought to have expected, putting an end to all our hopes, Mr. Villars no longer kept mea&s;ures with me; he wanted money: money he would have; and even told me in very plain terms, I might that very night put

him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fifty guineas if I would. &mdash; O, Mr. Babler, his propo&s;al was a horrid one.

For my own part, though I had forfeited all preten|&s;ions to the filial character, I was yet trembling|ly alive in all my other relations. I received the overture therefore with the indignation it merited; and Mr. Villars, finding that neither the mo&s;t &s;oothing language of hypocri&s;y, nor the mo&s;t vehement arguments of a hor&s;ewhip were &s;ufficient to alter my re&s;olution, he privately decamped in a few nights after, leaving me in a &s;trange country, not only without a &s;ix-pence, but over head and ears in debt, and in a &s;ituation al&s;o that required the tendere&s;t circum&s;pection. This was too much; it brought on the pains of parturiency, and I was delivered of a boy, who happily for him&s;elf poor Orphan, died in a few hours after his birth. For me I langui&s;hed a long time in the mo&s;t deplorable circum&s;tances, and mu&s;t have inevitably peri&s;hed, had it not been for the humanity of the company, who notwith|&s;tanding their own di&s;tre&s;&s;es were extremely ur|gent, neverthele&s;s &s;trained a point to relieve mine; and when my health was &s;omewhat e&s;tabli&s;hed

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR unfortunate corre&s;pondent Mrs. Vil|lars, at the conclu&s;ion of her letter in your la&s;t paper, gave an intimation, that if her heart was any way at ea&s;e &s;he could amu&s;e the public with &s;ome curious adventures of a &s;trolling Com|pany; now, Sir, that your readers may not be di&s;appointed of &s;uch an entertainment, I have
<PB N="95" REF="104">
taken the liberty to &s;end you the following little narrative; and &s;hall not, through an ill-timed af|fectation of mode&s;ty &s;ay, you will confer a great obligation on me by giving it an immediate place.</P>
<P>BY &s;ome &s;uch unhappy attachment as Mrs. Villars, I became, about three years ago, a Mem|ber of a Strolling Company in the we&s;t of England, and as my voice was tollerably good, my per&s;on not di&s;agreeable, and my pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;tage not a little vehement, I made a very capital figure in all the country towns of our circuit, and &s;hone away every other night as a Juliet, a Monimia, an Eudo&s;ia or a Statira. To be &s;ure it was often whim&s;ical enough to &s;ee a heroine of my con&s;e|quence in di&s;tre&s;s for a pair of &s;tockings, an odd ruffle, or a tolerable cap. Yet the novelty of the profe&s;&s;ion, and the greatne&s;s of my applau&s;e, very readily induced me to overlook all difficulties; add to this likewi&s;e, that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the invaluable &s;ociety of the amiable vagabond who undid me, a circum&s;tance of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate for every other inconvenience or misfortune.</P>
<P>MY fir&s;t appearance, Mr. Babler, was in the character of Cordelia in king Lear. My hu&s;band performed the part of Edgar, and our theatre, which was little better than a large barn, was re|markably crouded again&s;t the time of repre&s;entation. The univer&s;al approbation which I met with at my very entrance, gave me &s;pirits to go on in the part with tolerable propriety; and had it not been for an unexpected accident or two, the piece would
<PB N="96" REF="105">
in general have been pretty well per&s;onated. The fir&s;t cau&s;e of complaint was given by the lady who played the part of Goneril; it &s;eems this illu&s;trious prince&s;s was violently afflicted with a weakne&s;s of her nerves, and this unfortunate di&s;order obliged her to make frequent application to a certain underbred potable called gin, an additional quan|tity of which, as <HI>'the tincture of &s;age'</HI> was not then in exi&s;tence, &s;he generally took <Q>to fortify her&s;elf again&s;t the terrors of an audience.</Q> Unluckily, however, this medicine always di&s;appointed Mrs. Torrington in it's operation; in&s;tead of removing her complaint, it con&s;tantly encrea&s;ed her infir|mity, and rendered her &s;ometimes &s;carcely able to utter an articulate &s;yllable. This was the ca&s;e the above evening; and nothing could be more diverting, than to &s;ee a &s;taggering prince&s;s up|braiding the intemperance of her father's followers. The barn, I beg pardon, the hou&s;e, was in an ab&s;olute roar all the time of her performance; which her Maje&s;ty conceiving to be rather the &s;hout of contempt than the voice of approbation, &s;he advanced with a haughty &s;tep to the edge of the &s;tage, and in a language little &s;uited to the dig|nity of her character, &s;tammered out, <Q>That it was no unu&s;ual thing for a woman to be over|taken a little; and that &s;he warranted many of the conceited B&mdash;ch-s who were patched up in the boxes, could drink double the quantity &s;he had taken, and therefore need not turn away their faces with &s;uch an air of in&s;olence.</Q> Whe|ther
<PB N="97" REF="106">
her efforts to make this excellent elegant ha|rangue occa&s;ioned any agitation at her &s;tomach, or whether nature of it&s;elf was determined to throw off the load with which it was oppre&s;t, is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to determine; but to the everla&s;ting &s;tain of the drama I am obliged to acknowledge, that her oration was not half a minute pronounced, before it was attended with, &s;uch a di&s;agreeable di&s;charge upon the two fid|lers, who compo&s;ed our entire band of mu&s;ic, as reduced them to the nece&s;&s;ity of making a pre|cipitate retreat; and made it ab&s;olutely proper for two lords, a candle &s;nuffer and journeyman barber, to carry off the queen by force, to her own apartment.</P>
<P>THE confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by this unlucky accident was ju&s;t beginning to be removed, when a fre&s;h affair aro&s;e that excited, if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;till &s;tronger laugh of ridicule from the audience. Mr. Grandi&s;on, (for all our &s;trolling players are very fond of &s;ounding names) who performed the part of <HI>Glo&s;ter,</HI> and was reckoned one of the be&s;t &s;tudies in the company, depending too much upon the goodne&s;s of his memory, found him&s;elf at a dead &s;tand in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of his cha|racter. Till his eyes were put out no man could be more perfect; but this melancholy &s;entence had no &s;ooner taken place, than he was obliged to beg permi&s;&s;ion to read the remainder of his cha|racter, and not ea&s;ily finding this remarkable line,
<Q>Alack I have no eyes.</Q>
<PB N="98" REF="107">
there was no re&s;training the merriment of our auditors; a thou&s;and jokes were ince&s;&s;antly crack|ed upon every one who appeared, &s;o that we were fairly obliged to drop the curtain in the middle of the fourth act; and forced to &s;pin out the even|ing's entertainment with the Mock Doctor, Mr. Pope's prologue to Cato, and a double hornpipe.</P>
<P>THERE are a number of infatuated young people, Mr. Babler, who becau&s;e they &s;ee what an ea&s;y appearance the performers of the London Theatres generally make, are idle enough to &s;up|po&s;e that the very meane&s;t &s;tages of an itinerant actor mu&s;t afford at lea&s;t a tollerable maintenance. But alas, Sir, ab&s;tracted from the continual con|tempts to which the profe&s;&s;ion is liable, there is not a more mi&s;erable way of getting bread in the uni|ver&s;e; I have many nights played Cali&s;ta for two-pence halfpenny; and &s;ometimes after exhau&s;ting my &s;pirits perhaps as a Tragedy Queen for a whole night together, have returned home to a wretched little room in an alehou&s;e, and there, without having a mor&s;el for my &s;upper, been obliged to buck up my only &s;hift in the wa&s;h-hand ba&s;on, and to get a part of twenty lengths by heart again&s;t the next night of performance.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e mortifying &s;cenes the wretched itinerants are under a nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;uming a con|tented a&s;pect, and putting on an air of the utmo&s;t life, when perhaps they are ab&s;olutely peri&s;hing for bread. Forced in the decay of bu&s;ine&s;s to beg a little credit from chandlers-&s;hops or alehou&s;es,
<PB N="99" REF="108">
they are continually &s;ubject to in&s;ults from the meane&s;t members of the community; and even if matters an&s;wer their ample&s;t expectations, the de&s;|picable &s;hifts which they mu&s;t try to make a be|nefit, are in&s;upportable to any mind which retains the lea&s;t trace of &s;pirit or &s;en&s;ibility. As for the men they mu&s;t court an acquaintance with the lowe&s;t journeyman artizan, and &s;pend their time in the mo&s;t dreadful of all employments, the amu&s;ement of underbred ignorance and brutality: as for the women, they mu&s;t patiently hear the pert &s;ollicitations of the verie&s;t little prentice of a country town; and &s;ubmit to the infamy of an imaginary pro&s;titution, even where they have vir|tue enough to avoid the reality. Let your young readers, Mr. Babler, &s;eriou&s;ly think on the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, and then I hope few, e&s;pecially of the &s;ofter &s;ex, will ever think of embracing &s;o de&s;picable an employment.

<P>IT is a privilege with the greate&s;t number of tho&s;e people who entertain a high notion of their own wit, to rail for-ever at the only in&s;titu|tion upon which the happine&s;s of all Society is founded; and to pour out an ince&s;&s;ant torrent of ridicule upon poor matrimony, though they owe their own exi&s;tence to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that
<PB N="100" REF="109">
&s;acred ordinance. The motive indeed which the generality of our Libertines a&s;&s;ign for this aver&s;ion to marriage is, that the rite is a re&s;traint upon all their other enjoyments, and that the moment a man devotes him&s;elf to one woman, that moment he is obliged not only to alter the former tenor of his conduct, but to put up with every petulance of the lady's temper, however unrea&s;onable &s;he may be in her reque&s;ts, or however arbritary &s;he may be in the exerci&s;e of her authority.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, though I have hitherto continued an old batchelor, I have yet &s;een but few women who rule with an improper authority over their hu&s;bands; nor can I entertain any high notions of the man's under&s;tanding, who once makes it a doubt whether or no he &s;hould be able to maintain that connubial pre-eminence in his own family, which he receives from the hand of rea&s;on and the cu&s;tom of his country. If he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es but a dawn of &s;en&s;e, the object of his choice will be &s;uch as can give him no cau&s;e to appre|hend any turbulence of di&s;po&s;ition; and if he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es but a dawn of &s;pirit, he will always have it in his power to prevent any di&s;agreeable exertion of it, even in ca&s;e he &s;hould be unhappily deceived.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ante&s;t argument of all, however, is the nece&s;&s;ity which a married man is under of for&s;aking all tho&s;e enjoyments, which while he was a batchelor created the principal part of his felicity. Yet &s;urely if tho&s;e enjoyments are repugnant to rea&s;on, the &s;ooner he for&s;akes them
<PB N="101" REF="110">
the better, &s;ince it never can be too early a period to regain the paths of di&s;cretion and virtue; and if they are not oppo&s;ite to the dictates of prudence, he mu&s;t be a very pu&s;illanimous fellow indeed, who could once dream of giving them up. In fact, tho&s;e men are always for finding fault with the poor women, who are con&s;cious of imperfec|tions in them&s;elves; whereas men of &s;en&s;e being determined to proceed on a rational plan, are con|&s;tantly de&s;irous of doing ju&s;tice to the merit of the ladies, and never prepo&s;terou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e that they are de&s;titute either of benevolence or under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE general run of our Libertines, though they are much too &s;en&s;ible and much too &s;pirited to put up with any impropriety in the behaviour of a worthy woman, nevertheless &s;ubmit with the greate&s;t chearfulne&s;s imaginable to any treatment which a woman of the Town thinks proper to give them, and ble&s;s their &s;tars with a kind of rapture that they are not hu&s;bands: &mdash; This is in plain Engli&s;h, they rejoice that they are not obliged by the laws of their country to bear a merited reproach from the lips of a de&s;erving wife, though the narrowne&s;s of their minds and the ba&s;ene&s;s of their &s;pirits, can induce them &s;o readily to put up with the mo&s;t impudent airs of a de&s;picable &s;trum|pet, and to crouch with an infamous &s;ervility at her feet.</P>
<P>SAM. SQUANDER is a melancholy proof of this a&s;&s;ertion: Sam at the age of twenty came into an affluent fortune, and launched into all the
<PB N="102" REF="111">
licentious di&s;&s;ipations which generally captivate young men of opulent circum&s;tances. Fearful that his plea&s;ures, if folly and vice may be called plea&s;ures, would be manacled by the &s;ilken bands of wedlock, he declared him&s;elf an early enemy to marriage, and has continued to this hour, when he is near as old a fellow as my&s;elf, without even wi&s;hing to ta&s;te the &s;weets of a dome&s;tic felicity. Yet though aver&s;e to an honourable connection with the &s;ex, he could not exi&s;t without &s;ome fe|minine attachment; attentive therefore to the mere gratifications of &s;en&s;e, he &s;ingled out a fa|vourite nymph from the purlieus of Drury-lane, took her publicly to his hou&s;e, and has cohabited with her now above thirty years. A more un|governable termagant probably never lived; yet Sam is quite happy he is not married. She has more than once been detected in an amour with his footmen; but what of that, Sam put it up, &s;he was not his wife. If &s;he throws a gla&s;s at his head, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, or confines him within doors for a fortnight, it is no matter, Sam is &s;till happy, and laughs at any of his ac|quaintance who go home at twelve o'clock, for fear of making their wives unea&s;y, by a longer ab&s;ence from their families. One thing indeed makes him mi&s;erable, he has two &s;ons by this in|famous woman, of whom he is pa&s;&s;ionately fond, and the reflexion that his e&s;tate mu&s;t go into ano|ther line for want of a ligitimate offspring, is a circum&s;tance which renders him con&s;tantly unhap|py,
<PB N="103" REF="112">
even in his fortunate &s;tate of batchelor&s;hip: &s;o that I believe if the truth were known, Sam is &s;ecretly of opinion with me, that a good wife is the fir&s;t of all the human felicities; and that the greate&s;t of all fools is he who puts up with the numberle&s;s vices of a profligate woman, through a fear of meeting &s;ome natural imperfections in a woman of intrinsic merit and character.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ingenious Mr. Percy in the preface to his edition of old ballads, declares it as his opinion, that nothing indicates the nature of the times more &s;trongly than the compo&s;ition of tho&s;e &s;ongs which are in every body's mouth. Should what he advances upon this occa&s;ion be generally allowed, I am very much afraid that the pre&s;ent <HI>anno domini</HI> would come in for a very de&s;picable &s;ort of a character. Our ballads for the principal part being &s;o flim&s;y in their compo&s;ition, and &s;o dangerous in their end, that very few of them are fit to be taken up by any per&s;on either of deli|cacy or under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IN the infancy of Engli&s;h poe&s;y, though the ver&s;ification of our bards was naturally rough and inharmonious, &s;till the elevation of &s;entiment, and morality of de&s;ign which breathed through all

their compo&s;itions, rendered them always pa&s;&s;able, and frequently entertaining and in&s;tructive. But in the&s;e politer times when every man is either a critic or a poet, &s;entiment and de&s;ign are equally di&s;regarded: &s;o a little &s;moothne&s;s in the numbers, and a little cha&s;tity in the rhimes are attended to, we never once trouble our heads about entertain|ment or in&s;truction; but go on through thirty or forty lines of lu&s;cious in&s;ipidity with the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ure, as if the lyric walk of poetry was invented merely to &s;tupify our feelings or to corrupt our principles.</P>
<P>THE only &s;ubjects upon which our modern lyric poets ever think of exerting their talents are love and wine. When the &s;tringer up of a love-&s;ong conde&s;cends to take the pen, he tells us that young Colin met with Chloe one May morning in the grove, and that there he pre&s;&s;ed her to be very naughty, and offered her a bit of ribband as a reward for &s;ubmitting to his infamous &s;ollicitations, but that the good girl not choo&s;ing to pro&s;titute her&s;elf for &s;uch a trifle, Colin is &s;o &s;truck with the dignity of her virtue, that he mar|ries her at once; and the delicate young virgin thinks it the greate&s;t happine&s;s in the world, to be the wife of a ra&s;cal who wanted to ruin her peace and bla&s;t her reputation.</P>
<P>IF a modern ballad-writer indeed wants to be uncommonly arch and humorous, he goes a diffe|rent way to work; he tells us that bri&s;k Will the ploughman having long had a pa&s;&s;ion for Nell,
<PB N="105" REF="114">
the dairy-maid, he way-lays the girl as &s;he is going to milk her cows, and finding that there is no po&s;&s;ibility of arguing her out of her virtue, he &s;eizes that by force which &s;he refu&s;es to grant through favour, and very fairly ravi&s;hes her. Nell, who all her life before had been a girl of principle, in&s;tead of harbouring the lea&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t the villain for &s;o infamous an outrage, bur&s;ts into a loud fit of laughing, acquaints him that all her former preten&s;ions to virtue were nothing more than the re&s;ult of affectation; and invites him with all the confidence of habitual pro&s;titution; to a repetition of their guilty intercour&s;e. The more bare-faced the indecency the more humorous we reckon the compo&s;ition; and the prudent mama teaches it to her infant daughter, and inflames the opening imagination with the earlie&s;t de&s;cription of that glowing connection of the &s;exes, which in a little time is but too likely to endanger both her happine&s;s and her character.</P>
<P>THE gentlemen, however, who celebrate the virtues of the grape, go &s;till farther than the pro|fe&s;&s;ed votaries of cupid: with all the &s;tupidity of the love-&s;ong writers, they inculcate a greater &s;hare of immorality, and advi&s;e us no le&s;s to the utmo&s;t brutalities of intoxication, than to the ut|mo&s;t exce&s;&s;es of a libidinous &s;en&s;uality. They teach us to think that the joys of futurity are in|finitely unequal to the profligacies of the &s;tew, and that we are rai&s;ed into &s;omething equal with the
<PB N="106" REF="115">
Deity, when we have deba&s;ed our&s;elves con&s;ider|ably lower than men.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be remarked on this occa&s;ion, that the &s;ong is much too incon&s;iderable a &s;pecies of poetry to po&s;&s;e&s;s either entertainment or in&s;truc|tion, and that if it affords our mu&s;icians an op|portunity of exerting the force of &s;ound, it is all that can be rea&s;onably expected. With the greate&s;t deference, however, to the opinion of &s;uch accurate critics as may argue in this manner, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if this &s;pecies of poetry is capable of being perverted to the purpo&s;es of vice, it is al&s;o capable of being turned to the intere&s;ts of virtue. It does not follow becau&s;e a poem is &s;et to mu&s;ic that it &s;hould be de&s;titute of decency or &s;entiment. Tho&s;e &s;acred compo&s;itions which we &s;ing in hon|our of the Deity however execrably we have &s;een them ver&s;ified, are neverthele&s;s fraught with in|&s;truction, and it is that in&s;truction only which in their pre&s;ent mi&s;erable dre&s;s has rendered them any way tollerable. Of con&s;equence therefore if a little good &s;en&s;e in our hymns does not di&s;grace the importance of the &s;ubject, it cannot po&s;&s;ibly le&s;&s;en tho&s;e inferior productions which we com|po&s;e for the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ocial enjoyment and friend|ly fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>INCONSIDERABLE as the compo&s;ition of a &s;ong may &s;eem upon it's fir&s;t appearance, never|thele&s;s when we reflect, that of all the different kinds of poetry it is what is mo&s;t generally in our mouths, and con&s;equently what is mo&s;t familiar to
<PB N="107" REF="116">
our recollection, a man of any &s;en&s;e or benevo|lence cannot but regret to find it &s;o generally pro&s;tituted to the purpo&s;es of folly or vice. The elegance of an air can by no means de&s;troy the profligacy of a &s;candalous &s;entiment. Mu&s;ic on the contrary is well known to give an additi|onal energy to language, and many a young lady by habituating her&s;elf to hear the in&s;iduous ad|dre&s;&s;es of a de&s;igning lover in ver&s;e, has been brought to countenance the mo&s;t immediate appli|cations of palpable pro&s;e; and led at la&s;t into an e&s;teem of tho&s;e principles by a &s;ong, which would have &s;hocked her to the la&s;t degree had they been fir&s;t of all communicated in common conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons therefore, I wi&s;h to &s;ee the lyric &s;pecies of compo&s;ition re&s;cued from con|tempt, e&s;pecially &s;ince it is a mortification to every gentleman of mu&s;ical abilities, to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of giving &s;uch an embelli&s;hment to the productions of vice or &s;tupidity, as mu&s;t not on|ly greatly di&s;gu&s;t his own good &s;en&s;e, but mate|rially injure the morals of the public.</P>

<P>IT has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by a very &s;en&s;ible writer, that there is nothing in the world which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more humility than pride; and no|thing
<PB N="108" REF="117">
which induces us to make more unnece&s;&s;ary conce&s;&s;ions to other people, than a de&s;ire of en|hancing the importance of our&s;elves. This vanity leads us into a thou&s;and ab&s;urdities, and not &s;el|dom into a number of vices; to expo&s;e it therefore &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent paper, and if I can make but one reader a little a&s;hamed of his low-minded exaltation, I &s;hall do more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice than if I had employed half a century in the more elegant purpo&s;es of that delicate amu&s;ement, where &s;ober in&s;truction is &s;acrificed to a prettine&s;s of &s;tile, and the imagination kept perpetually alive at the total expence of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>MY nephew, Harry Rattle, called upon me ye&s;terday, and told me, if I would pa&s;s the even|ing with him at the Cardigan Head, he did not doubt but what I &s;hould meet with a &s;ufficient &s;ubject for a paper or two, as he was engaged in a party where there were to be &s;ome extraordinary characters. Having nothing very material on my hands, I a&s;&s;ented to his propo&s;al, and calling upon him about &s;even o'clock in a hackney coach, we went together to the tavern, where all his friends were already a&s;&s;embled, and good naturedly la|menting the want of his company.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t per&s;on who attracted my ob&s;ervation was a young fellow of about thirty, dre&s;t in regi|mentals, whom I found to he a Captain of Dra|goons, and who, it &s;eems, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the humble &s;tation of a quarter ma&s;ter to the command of a troop, merely by the bravery of his
<PB N="109" REF="118">
behaviour in the celebrated battle of Minden. I had not been in company many minutes before I &s;aw this gentleman entertained the highe&s;t notions imaginable of his own importance: when he &s;poke it was with an air of vi&s;ible &s;uperiority; he a&s;|&s;umed a dignity of look, and an indifference of accent, as if he conferred a prodigious favour in in every &s;yllable he uttered; and took care to loo&s;e no opportunity of informing us what a num|ber of the fir&s;t nobility he had the honour of ranking among&s;t his mo&s;t intimate acquaintance. If any body differed from his opinion, he had canva&s;&s;ed the point with lord &s;uch a thing, but the day before; and as to &s;ecrets of a political nature, no man in the kingdom knew more of the mo&s;t private tran&s;actions of government. He had called upon a certain Earl in the morning, who let him into &s;ome matters of the fir&s;t con&s;equence; and dined with a noble Duke, who a&s;&s;ured him, that there would be no change what&s;oever in the mini&s;try. In &s;hort, let the conver&s;ation turn upon what it would, he bore down all oppo&s;ition with, &s;ome right honourable friend of his; and thought it an unaccountable pre&s;umption, in any per&s;on who did not allow a nobleman's name to have more weight than an ab&s;olute matter of fact in an argument.</P>
<P>WHEN Harry and I were returning home, he gave me the Captain's hi&s;tory in nearly the fol|lowing words. <Q>The Captain, &s;ays he, though an hone&s;t and a brave man at bottom, is never|thele&s;s
<PB N="110" REF="119">
&s;uch a compound of arrogance and &s;er|vility, that I am often at a lo&s;s to know which he mo&s;t de&s;erves, our re&s;entment or our contempt. Originally bred in ob&s;curity, he conceives a &s;ort of adoration for every man with a title; and to be admitted into the company of a Lord, is mean enough to put up with all the in&s;olence of corona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed pride, and even &s;toops to run on the mo&s;t pitiful errands, for the &s;atisfaction of being reckoned among the number of it's acquain|tance. Yet this a&s;&s;iduity to oblige the great is not &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve him even from their ridicule; they &s;ee from what trivial motive his attachment ari&s;es, and treat him with more di&s;|re&s;pect than the lowe&s;t of their footmen, becau&s;e they know his pride will not &s;uffer him, on any account, to di&s;continue his attendance. Thus his vanity defeats it's own purpo&s;es&mdash; In&s;tead of encrea&s;ing his con&s;equence, it renders him ut|terly de&s;picable, and makes him no le&s;s a je&s;t to his &s;uperiors, than to tho&s;e who are merely on a footing with him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT little man of whom you took notice of in black (continued Harry) is al&s;o a dupeto his own vanity, but that vanity is intirely of a dif|ferent &s;ort; he wants to pa&s;s upon the world as a man of prodigious under&s;tanding; and to gain this important end, he is continually com|mencing an acquaintance with every author of reputation to whom he can get introduced, from a &s;trange &s;uppo&s;ition that his friends will
<PB N="111" REF="120">
encrea&s;e their e&s;timation of his abilities, in proportion to the intimacy of &s;uch a con|nection. It is incredible to think with what a humility of deference he courts a man of let|ters on this account. He prai&s;es him to the &s;kies in all companies, and repeats a poem with the mo&s;t ful&s;ome adulation, even before the face of the very author. An opinion of his own he never pretends to; nor does he once pre&s;ume to have a will in the mo&s;t trifling tran&s;action &mdash; Pinning his faith entirely on the &s;leeves of his literary directors, he &s;quares his religious principles by the writings of his theological friends; and regulates what con|cerns his health, by the productions of his phy|&s;ical acquaintance. His ta&s;te he conforms to the &s;tandard which is &s;et up by the profe&s;&s;ors of Belle Lettres &mdash; And let that &s;tandard be ne|ver &s;o ab&s;urd, he adopts it for fear of being di&s;carded for the in&s;olence of a di&s;&s;ent. Indeed this complai&s;ance often involves him in no trifling difficulties; for if two of the literati &s;hould happen to di&s;agree, he is puzzled how to act; if he takes part with one, he is &s;ure of de&s;troying him&s;elf in the e&s;timation of the other, and it is no ea&s;y circum&s;tance in &s;uch a ca&s;e to conciliate the good opinion of both. I once knew (proceeded Harry) when two doctors of his acquaintance were called in to attend him in a fit of the gout &mdash; Each propo&s;ed a different method of treating, his ca&s;e, and
<PB N="112" REF="121">
neither would &s;ubmit to the arguments of his competitor. In this dilemma he re&s;olved to comply with the pre&s;ciptions of both; therefore, lapping up his feet in a rye poultice, according to the advice of one, he took an elixer which was recommended to him by the other, and was very near being carried off by the injudi|cious application of &s;uch oppo&s;ite medicines. This, however, is not all&mdash;His con&s;cience, like his health, is &s;acrificed to the mandate of the theologi&s;t in company. Hence he is by turns a Prote&s;tant and a Di&s;&s;enter; if there happens to be more than one &s;ect, he is a jumble of each; and &s;ometimes, with a party of Free|thinkers, he has no religion at all.</Q> From the&s;e little anecdotes (concluded Harry) we may ea&s;ily &s;ee that nothing is &s;o &s;ure of rendering us contemptible, as a ridiculous vanity of &s;tealing a reputation from the con&s;equence of others, e&s;peci|ally wherea goodne&s;s of heart, and an attention to the &s;entiments of mode&s;t plain &s;en&s;e, are &s;o certain of building up the noble&s;t character for our&s;elves.</P>

<P>AS there are none of my readers for who&s;e happine&s;s I am more &s;olicitous than the younger part of my female purcha&s;ers, I mu&s;t now and then be excu&s;ed, if I &s;hould write a pa|per wholly for their in&s;truction; cut off from
<PB N="113" REF="122">
that general intercour&s;e with the world, which the other &s;ex to univer&s;ally enjoy, they &s;tand in|finitely more in need of advice, and endued with an infinitely greater &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility, they are more likely to retain it than the men, who look upon the finer feelings as a kind of di&s;grace to their &s;pirit, and imagine that the lea&s;t regard to the &s;entiments of any body el&s;e is the greate&s;t in&s;ult that can po&s;&s;ibly be offered to their own under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>IT is with no little indignation, that I fre|quently hear the capacity of the ladies ridiculed by the wits of the other &s;ex; and even find that the grave&s;t of our modern writers look upon an enlarged education, rather as a prejudice than benefit to the mo&s;t beautiful part of the human creation; for my own part, I can by no means &s;ee how cultivating the mind can be in the lea&s;t prejudicial to the morals; nor di&s;cover how a woman can be rendered more unfit for the man|agement of a family, by acquiring an additional &s;hare of knowledge and di&s;cretion. I readily grant, that a famale pedant is of all pedants the mo&s;t intolerable, and that nothing is &s;o likely to di&s;|turb the judgment as a &s;uperficial acquaintance, either with the languages or the &s;ciences; but a progre&s;&s;ive and well grounded in&s;truction in the u&s;eful parts of literature mu&s;t always be produc|tive of benefit, and mu&s;t always give an equal encrea&s;e of under&s;tanding to either of the &s;exes.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="123">NOTWITHSTANDING this declaration how|ever, there is one branch of education, which even the wits them&s;elves think the ladies cannot attain too early, that I wi&s;h with all my heart was delayed till they arrive at years of di&s;cre|tion, and began to form notions of the world with &s;ome little degree of propriety. I the more readily expre&s;s this wi&s;h, becau&s;e the protraction of the branch I allude to, can by no means be prejudicial, either to their intere&s;t, their morals, or their capacities. The part of education which I am here &s;o de&s;irous of keeping a con|&s;iderable time from the ladies, is nothing more than the knowledge of writing: I do not know that a young woman has a greater enemy in the world than an ink-&s;tand, and many a parent who boa&s;ts of the rapidity with which his daughter now improves in the art of writing, may in a year or two have a very lamentable motive for wi&s;hing that &s;he never learned to write at all.</P>
<P>A YOUNG woman now-a-days, let her be never &s;o homely, &s;carcely reaches her fifteenth or &s;ixteenth year, but what &s;ome body takes an opportunity of pouring the fa&s;cinating lan|guage of adulation into her ear; and it rarely happens that this &s;omebody is the per&s;on, who if a treaty of marriage was propo&s;ed, would meet with the approbation of her family: naturally credulous at &s;o early a period, the mo&s;t di&s;tant compliment is actually &s;et down as a po&s;itive declaration, and the man is exalted into a <HI>fir&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="124">
love,</HI> as it is called, for behaving with little more perhaps than an ordinary &s;hare of civility: the con&s;equence therefore generally is that an amour en&s;ues, and the place of per&s;onal interviews is &s;upplied by a literary corre&s;pondence; Mi&s;s, while her doating relations &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he is reading &s;ome pious meditation, is mo&s;t devoutly em|ployed in the compo&s;ition of darts and daggers to her Strephon: and &s;etting her imagination on fire with the thoughts of a hu&s;band, when her infatuated father believes that her very motion to u&s;e the language of the poet, <HI>blu&s;hes at it&s;elf,</HI> and is certain, that &s;he would &s;ink into the earth, if a man was to look her in the face with any extraordinary degree of &s;teadine&s;s. A girl at &s;ix|teen is mo&s;t commonly as de&s;irous of being thought a woman, as when a woman of forty, wi&s;hes to be a girl of &s;ixteen. Attentive to nothing but the impul&s;e either of her pa&s;&s;ion or her vanity, the <HI>dear creature</HI> of a man probably receives half a dozen letters a day, till his vanity blazes the matter about, and her deluded parents find their lovely little innocent has very vehement de&s;ires under all that &s;pecious veil of &s;implicity; and burns for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a bed-fellow, notwith|&s;tanding all her terrors, if a man but accidently comes into her company.</P>
<P>IN reality a woman of this country has very few occa&s;ions for the art of writing, but to carry on a literary corre&s;pondence; and this corre&s;pon|dence is always begun &s;o very early, and directed
<PB N="116" REF="125">
&s;o very injudiciou&s;ly, that it is generally unhappy in the end. A woman can have no occa&s;ion to corre&s;pondend with a lover, who meets the appro|bation of her family, and nothing can be more imprudent or dangerous than to corre&s;pond with a man who does not; but be&s;ides the imprudence and the danger of writing to young fellows, there is a di&s;grace always attending &s;uch a circum&s;tance, which I am &s;urprized does not more frequently deter a lady from committing the indi&s;cretion. The men, however, ju&s;t in their engagements with one another, are mo&s;t commonly unju&s;t in their connection with the other &s;ex; the glory of being e&s;teemed by an amiable woman is too much to be concealed; a bo&s;om friend mu&s;t be tru&s;ted with the important &s;ecret; and this bo|&s;om friend has <HI>his</HI> confidant, with whom it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be depo&s;ited; &s;o that while the un&s;u&s;|pecting fair one believes her reputation is care|fully locked up in the bo&s;om of her adorer, &s;he is the general &s;ubject of conver&s;ation with fifty other fellows, and is profligately je&s;ted with per|haps in half the taverns of the kingdom. Many a &s;en&s;ible woman when &s;he has reached two or three and twenty, has blu&s;hed for her epi&s;tles of &s;ixteen; and &s;ickened when &s;he has married a man of intrin&s;ic worth, at the bare recollection of the power which &s;ome ra&s;cal may po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;s of expo&s;ing the weakne&s;s of her earlier years. For the&s;e rea&s;ons therefore, I cannot but think that a ha&s;ty introduction of a girl to paper and
<PB N="117" REF="126">
pens, is as injudicious a mea&s;ure as a parent can fall into. She can at any time get a me&s;&s;enger to carry a letter, when fear or &s;hame will prevent her from applying to any per&s;on to write one; if therefore parents would be a little more attentive in teaching their daughters to read and &s;pell with propriety, than anxious about the goodne&s;s of their hand-writing, they would improve their minds con&s;iderably more, and keep them from a number of temptations which often prove too powerful both for their pride and their virtue.</P>

<P>THERE is no &s;uppo&s;ition more ab&s;urd, than that which is generally made by the world in &s;avour of learned men; a profound &s;cholar, we imagine, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be a per&s;on of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncommon wi&s;dom; and the more his head is fraught with unnece&s;&s;ary knowledge, the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e we encrea&s;e in our veneration of his abilities.

Lilly or Whettenal. That knowledge in fact is mo&s;t u&s;eful, which is be&s;t calculated to carry us through the world with ea&s;e and reputation; and as learning it&s;elf was in&s;tituted for no other pur|po&s;es, we mu&s;t allow that it fails of attaining it's mo&s;t &s;alutary views where it is merely em|ployed in the vain pur&s;uits of a ridiculous parade, or an idle &s;peculation.</P>
<P>INDEED if there was no commerce what&s;o|ever to be carried on between mankind, and if there was no nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;cholars of an academy ever to make an e&s;&s;ay on the great &s;tage of life in the parts of men, it might be right enough to breed our children up in a total ignorance of all worldly affairs; but when, as I have ju&s;t hinted, it is with the profe&s;&s;ed intention of enabling them to appear with a tollerable grace in this important theatre, that we give them an education, nothing &s;urely can be more prepo&s;terous, than to employ them entirely in tho&s;e &s;tudies which render &s;uch an appearance additionally difficult, and give them rather a di&s;gu&s;t than an inclination to put on their re&s;pective characters.</P>
<P>THESE reflexions I have been in&s;en&s;ibly led into by recollecting &s;ome anecdotes of my poor friend Dick Thornhill, of St. John's in the Uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge. Dick being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very pretty fortune, u&s;ed to con&s;ole him&s;elf prodigiou&s;ly whenever he heard any body talk about the &s;tocks, that none of his money was employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Government&punc; He
<PB N="119" REF="128">
imagined, that in proportion to the encrea&s;e of the&s;e political barometers, the burden of the &s;ub|jects were encrea&s;ed; and believed, that in&s;tead of receiving &s;o much per cent for the u&s;e of his pro|perty, he actually paid &s;o much for having it pro|tected. In this &s;en&s;ible manner he &s;till continues to go on, and laughs very heartily at the fools, as he calls them, who wantonly throw away &s;uch prodigious &s;ums of money, merely that others may take care of tho&s;e affairs, which he &s;ays, they can manage &s;o very ea&s;ily them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;tanding a few days ago at the &s;hop of a &s;econd-hand book&s;eller in a populous part of this metropolis, where I often meet with an odd volume of &s;ome antiquated author, and have &s;ometimes the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my own works ru&s;ting in all the peaceable dulne&s;s of the mo&s;t perfect ob&s;curity: The book&s;eller, agreeable to the practice of his trade, has his various old vo|lumes cla&s;&s;ed into different arrangements, and at the head of each the price is affixed, to avoid being pe&s;tered with the que&s;tions of occa&s;ional purcha&s;ers. My old friend Dick happening acci|dentally to come up&mdash;he made a full &s;tand, and be|ing &s;truck with the appearance of a thick actavo which lay under the fourpenny catalogue, he a&s;ked the man if he would take a &s;hilling for that book, to which the con&s;cientious &s;hopkeeper an&s;wering in the affirmative, he marched off with an air of vi&s;ible &s;atisfaction, and I &s;uppo&s;e thought he had met with a very tolerable bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="129">THE plea&s;ante&s;t &s;tory however, which I have heard for a long time of my old friend, was one which was mentioned to me ye&s;terday evening at the coffee-hou&s;e; Dick it &s;eems the day before was going through Clare-market, where, acciden|tally &s;truck with the &s;ight of a nice &s;houlder of lamb, a joint of which he is particularly fond, he a&s;ked a good woman to whom it belonged, what was the price of it, &s;he an&s;wered &s;ix groats; <Q>&s;ix groats (returned Dick a little peevi&s;hly,) do you imagine, mi&s;tre&s;s, that people pick up their money in the &s;treets? &s;ix groats indeed! at one word I will give you half a crown for it;</Q> well, Sir, (replied the woman) I will not haggle with a cu&s;tomer; &s;o taking the half crown, &s;he to&s;&s;ed the lamb into a ba&s;ket, and &s;ent it to Dick's lodgings, who plumed him&s;elf not a little upon his addre&s;s as a market-man. Mr. Thornhill, notwith&s;tanding all this, is a very excellent &s;cholar, few young fellows ever left the Univer&s;ity with greater credit than him&s;elf. But unhappily poring over the cu&s;toms of Greece and Rome, when he ought to have made &s;ome little acquaintance with the manners of his own country, he is as much a &s;tranger to the common tran&s;actions of life, as if he had been bred up to the pre&s;ent moment in a wilderne&s;s! and was now let loo&s;e upon the world for the mere entertainment of &s;ociety. Unable to conver&s;e with any company but tho&s;e who, like him&s;elf, are elevated on the aukward &s;tilts of a merely cla&s;&s;ical education, he de&s;pi&s;es every body
<PB N="121" REF="130">
who is not a proficient in the dead languages; and in return, meets with nothing but the general aver&s;ion of the people whom he treats with this general contempt. Upon the whole, his very be&s;t friends pity his total ignorance of the world, and lament that &s;o hone&s;t a fellow as he is in the main, &s;hould be &s;uch a torment to him&s;elf, &s;uch a trouble to every body el&s;e, and &s;uch a u&s;ele&s;s member of &s;ociety. In &s;hort, if it were po&s;&s;ible for him to change all his learning for the experi|ence of the barber's boy who attends him, they think he would be a con&s;iderable gainer by the bargain; though this poor fellow is the con&s;tant object of his ridicule, and one of the people whom he ince&s;&s;antly bandies about with &s;ignificant &s;en|tences of Greek and Latin from &s;ome of his fa|vourite authors.</P>

<P>WALKING in the park a few mornings ago with my nephew Harry, a gentleman of a very prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing appearance came up, and &s;haking Harry with the utmo&s;t cordiality by the hand, in|&s;i&s;ted upon his going to dine with him, with a friendly &s;ort of peremptorine&s;s; and in a manner extremely polite, begged the favour of my company. As I found Harry accepted the invitation readily, I bowed my a&s;&s;ent to it likewi&s;e, and after taking a turn or two more, we &s;et out for the gentle|man's
<PB N="122" REF="131">
hou&s;e, in the neighbourhood of Great George-&s;treet, and amu&s;ed our&s;elves in his library, which was judiciou&s;ly furni&s;hed, till the &s;ummons arrived for dinner, about four o'clock. We were then conducted to an elegant dining room, where we found an excellent family dinner, and where I had the honour of being introduced to a mo&s;t ami|able young lady, whom I took to be the &s;i&s;ter of our ho&s;t, but who, upon an enquiry, I found to be unhappily no le&s;s than his daughter.</P>
<P>I SAY unhappily no le&s;s than his daughter, becau&s;e I am pefectly of opinion with the late excellent Mr. Richard&s;on, that a gay young fel|low of eight or nine and thirty, is a very impro|per per&s;on to be the father of a young woman of eighteen or nineteen. Full of life and levity him|&s;elf, he is unable to pay a proper attention to the felicity of his child; and if he chances to be a man of the town, like my nephew's friend, he treats her in a manner that mu&s;t either excite her conti|nual dete&s;tation, or de&s;troy that purity of principle, which only can lay a &s;olid foundation for the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of her future happine&s;s and reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. MEDLICOAT, the gentleman with whom we dined, piques him&s;elf, as he is &s;o juvenile a father to &s;o grown a young lady, upon behaving to her as if &s;he was no relation what&s;oever, and is never &s;o happy as when a &s;tranger at any pub|lic place, &s;eems to take him for one of her admir|ers: during the time of dinner, he enjoyed my mi&s;|conception exce&s;&s;ively, and heard me once or
<PB N="123" REF="132">
twice &s;ay <HI>his &s;i&s;ter,</HI> without offering to rectify my mi&s;take. This however I could have chearfully over-looked, had not his conver&s;ation, even before the &s;ervants, been of a nature &s;o extremely inde|licate, that there was &s;carce a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;itting at table. An odious round of the mo&s;t palpa|ble <HI>double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entendre</HI> was frequently offered to our attention; the nocturnal exce&s;&s;es of which he had been guilty the la&s;t week, were related with an air of triumph; and he even went &s;o far as to mention the name of &s;ome celebrated courtezans, with whom he had the honour of an acquaintance.</P>
<P>ALL this time the poor young lady &s;at in the mo&s;t mortifying &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s; cut to the very &s;oul of her &s;en&s;ibility, yet unable either to retire, or to mention how greatly &s;he was affected with this intollerable behaviour of her father. My Harry, however, took the very fir&s;t opportunity of relieving her; for, the moment the cloth was removed, he begged Mr. Medlicoat would &s;hew us the fine hunter which he had purcha&s;ed a few days before, from a noted dealer in York&s;hire. Mr. Medlicoat, as proud of &s;hewing his hor&s;e, as de&s;irous of parading his daughter, immediately complied with the reque&s;t; and the young lady retired with a look of complacency at Harry, which &s;ufficiently te&s;tified how much he had oblig|ed her, by procuring her &s;o fortunate a relea&s;e from her father's company.</P>
<P>HARRY &s;upping with me in the evening, I could not help expre&s;&s;ing my wonder, that a young
<PB N="124" REF="133">
fellow of his good &s;en&s;e and delicacy, &s;hould con|tinue the lea&s;t corre&s;pondence with &s;o &s;hamele&s;s a profligate as this Mr. Medlicoat. <Q>An indecency of conver&s;ation in any man, &s;ays I, is always as &s;ure a &s;ign of a little under&s;tanding, as of a vulgar education: and nothing ought to give a generous mind more offence, than where we &s;ee the mode&s;ty of a virtuous moman in&s;ulted, by any of tho&s;e infamous ob&s;cenities, which your bucks, and &s;uch like de&s;picable fellows, imagine to be the criterion of &s;pirit and viva|city; but when a libertine is &s;o dead to all &s;en&s;ibility as to wound the ear of his own daughter with a gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of this nature, we are filled with horror as well as with indigna|tion, and cannot help con&s;idering him as a mon&s;ter, who would even violate her honour him&s;elf, did not a latent fear of the world re|&s;train the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;hocking imagi|nation, and happily confine him to mere innu|endoes, and &s;imple ge&s;ticulations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>YOUR ob&s;ervation, my dear Sir, (returned Harry) is perfectly ju&s;t, and I ought to blu&s;h at ever vi&s;iting &s;uch a man as Mr. Medlicoat, unle&s;s I had &s;ome other de&s;ign than merely to po&s;&s;e&s;s his company. But you mu&s;t know, that this fellow, unle&s;s he is particularly en|gaged abroad, always makes it a rule to en|gage a friend or two to dine with him every day; and if by any accident he &s;hould happen to be di&s;appointed, he traver&s;es the park, as
<PB N="125" REF="134">
he did this morning, to pick up an acquaint|ance for the credit of his table. By this means it often happens that poor Horten&s;ia his daugh|ter, is expo&s;ed to the heavie&s;t torrent of licen|tious ribaldry; and obliged to &s;it out many a conver&s;ation, which would appear &s;candalous in a Covent Garden tavern. Medlicoat piques him&s;elf upon a knowledge of the world, and treats every appearance of female delicacy; as a mon&s;trous affectation. He has found many fools among the &s;ex, and this has given him a prepo&s;terous opinion of the whole; therefore, to maintain his character as a knowing one, he u&s;es his own daughter with the &s;ame di&s;re|&s;pect that he u&s;es every other woman, and thinks it adds to the reputation of his under&s;tanding, to put of all appearance of nece&s;&s;ary decorum and parental partiality. It is for common fa|thers he thinks to behave with common di&s;|cretion; but young fellows like him, who are acquainted with life, &s;hould be above &s;uch a weakne&s;s; as the only way he thinks to pre|&s;erve the obedience of a daughter, is to &s;hew your &s;en&s;ibility of her &s;ex's imperfections. Hor|ten&s;ia, who has an amiable mind, and a fine under&s;tanding, is un&s;peakbly afflicted at this behaviour; and always rejoices when I take a dinner with them, as I con&s;tantly invent &s;ome excu&s;e or other to &s;et her at liberty. This is the only rea&s;on of my acting with com|mon civility to Medlicoat, as he is a man for
<PB N="126" REF="135">
whom I entertain the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt. Would you believe it, he keeps two women in the very &s;ame hou&s;e with his daughter; and the&s;e worthy ladies often take it in their heads to find fault with Horten&s;ia, and even complain to him that &s;he will not treat them with a &s;ufficient &s;hare of re&s;pect. Matters, however, if I have any penetration, cannot long go on in this manner, for Horten&s;ia has been &s;ome time courted by a very worthy baronet of for|tune; but Medlicoat having an aver&s;ion to become a grandfather yet a while, has ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed his con&s;ent; and in the mo&s;t illiberal terms, accu&s;ed the young lady of amorous incli|nations. Notwith&s;tanding this, they carry on a private corre&s;pondence, as I have good grounds to believe, and perhaps the next moon-light night may &s;ee the young couple on their journey to Edinburgh. May this I &s;ay, be the ca&s;e; and may every father who follow the &s;teps of Medlicoat, be rendered equally contemptible, and become equally di&s;appointed in his expec|tations.</Q></P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>BABLER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH there are few qualifications which afford us &s;o general a &s;atisfaction as an agree|able
<PB N="127" REF="136">
voice, yet there are few things which give us &s;o general a di&s;gu&s;t as the univer&s;al propen&s;ity which everybody has to &s;ing, without recollecting the judgment of their company, or con&s;idering the &s;cope of their own abilities. This ob&s;ervation, Mr. Babler, I had but too much rea&s;on to make ye&s;terday evening, at a meeting of &s;ome friends who had particularly a&s;&s;embled on purpo&s;e to pa&s;s three or four hours with a degree of more than ordinary plea&s;ure and fe&s;tivity: our party, Sir, was carefully &s;elected; and there was not a &s;ingle man in the room but what could hold a toa&s;t, give his &s;entiment, or &s;it up all night with a coun|try candidate at a conte&s;ted election.</P>
<P>THE royal family had &s;carcely gone round, Mr. Babler, when Dick Thomp&s;on was called upon for a &s;ong, who accordingly prepared to oblige us, and in an in&s;tant &s;truck up the celebrated air in Arne's opera of Artaxerxes,
<Q>Water parted from the &s;ea.</Q>
This, however, he executed in a manner &s;o very execrable, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty the whole company could keep from laughing in his face: we all of us &s;at upon thorns till he was done, and either picked our no&s;es or bit our nails till the complimentary bow at the conclu&s;ion hap|pily relea&s;ed us from &s;o unea&s;y a &s;ituation. Ne|verthele&s;s every body honoured him with a plaudit; and Dick really a&s;&s;umed as much dignity in his look, as if he had performed to a miracle.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="137">THE next per&s;on &s;ingled out was Kitt Turner; a young fellow with a voice quite of a different ca&s;t from Mr. Thomp&s;on's, and well enough adapted for the &s;ofter &s;pecies of &s;ongs, where there is no extraordinary number of &s;hakes or divi&s;ions. Kitt unhappily, regardle&s;s of the walk in which he could actually make a tolerable figure, attempted <HI>the School of Anacreon,</HI> and &s;trained his little lungs to &s;o uncon&s;cionable a degree, as rendered him utterly unable to give us any thing el&s;e the remainder of the evening.</P>
<P>WHEN Kitt had concluded, he called upon Tom Nel&s;on; who offered us <HI>the Soldier and the Sailor,</HI> provided we &s;uffered him to accompany this delightful compo&s;ition with the mu&s;ic of a pewter di&s;h. As Tom's principal motive was to enter|tain, no-body could be rude enough to di&s;&s;ent from his propo&s;al, and a pewter di&s;h was there|fore ordered up &s;tairs, which Mr. Nel&s;on kept &s;pinning on the table all the time of his &s;ong, oc|ca&s;ionally le&s;&s;ening or encrea&s;ing the velocity of its motion, according as the different movements of the tune rendered &s;uch a circum&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>FIRED with the approbation which was be|&s;towed upon the pewter di&s;h, the moment it came to Will Webly's turn, he chalked the back of his hand in two or three places, and rubbing it in two or three other places with a piece of burnt cork, he got up, and placing his hand again&s;t a particular part of the room, roared out, <HI>an old Woman cloathed in grey,</HI> working his fingers in &s;uch a manner as to
<PB N="129" REF="138">
rai&s;e &s;ome faint idea of an antiquated face; this was con&s;idered as a high &s;troke of humour, and produced no le&s;s than a &s;olo on the tongs, a con|certo on a pair of bellows, and Handel's water-piece on the &s;alt-box. The various performances, Mr. Babler, la&s;ted a con&s;iderable time, and every body &s;eemed to be plea&s;ed, though in fact it was no way difficult to &s;ee that every body was &s;ecretly di&s;&s;atisfied and di&s;appointed. For my own part, I never was more unea&s;y in a company &s;ince I knew what a company was, and took an opportunity of &s;tealing away about two o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>IT is in reality not a little odd, Mr. Babler, that people who are acquainted with their own deficiencies in point of voice, do not, when they are called upon among their friends, give &s;uch a &s;ong as is mo&s;t naturally &s;uited to their compa&s;s; what bu&s;ine&s;s has a fellow who can &s;carcely get through a plain derry down tune, to think of meddling with a difficult Italian air; or what nece&s;&s;ity is there for a man who never &s;aw a gamut in his life, to aim at executing a piece of mu&s;ic which actually calls for a performer of the mo&s;t capital abilities?</P>
<P>THE generality of people when they hear a &s;ong in our theatres which happens to hit their fancy, are con&s;tantly endeavouring to retail it among their acquaintance, without ever con&s;i|dering, that notwith&s;tanding all the advantages of an exqui&s;ite voice, and a con&s;ummate mu&s;ical
<PB N="130" REF="139">
Knowledge, the performer who &s;ings it, may &s;carcely be able to go through it with a &s;ufficient &s;hare of delicacy or judgment. A man, however, who would e&s;cape ridicule, ought to con&s;ider that tho&s;e &s;ongs may be to the la&s;t degree intolerable from him, which in Vernon would almo&s;t drag the theatre down with acclamations; and next to the merit of making him&s;elf plea&s;ing, he &s;hould re|member that the greate&s;t proof of good &s;en&s;e is not to render him&s;elf di&s;agreeable: on which account, therefore, tho&s;e who have but plain voices ought to &s;tick to plain &s;ongs; &s;ince in&s;tead of gaining any reputation by an attempt to &s;oar beyond their proper powers, they will do nothing more than offend the ears of every company they go into, and draw an everla&s;ting &s;mile of deri&s;ion upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT would al&s;o be judicious in tho&s;e ladies or gentlemen who occa&s;ionnly oblige their friends with a &s;ong, if as well as taking care not to med|dle with any difficult pieces of mu&s;ic, they like|wi&s;e took care never to meddle with a &s;ong where they were not perfectly acquainted with the words. How often have I heard a delicious mor&s;el of poetry mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly mangled, through the in|attention of a negligent &s;inger; and every gram|matical in&s;titute inhumanly butchered, through the want of a little recollection. Sorry am I to add, that I have mo&s;t generally ob&s;erved the&s;e im|perfections among the ladies; and have frequently conceived a di&s;gu&s;t to a very pa&s;&s;able face, merely
<PB N="131" REF="140">
becau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was &s;o totally unacquainted with Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>AT &s;ome other opportunity, Mr. Babler, per|haps I may again trouble you with a &s;crawl, for the pre&s;ent I believe I have given you enough, and therefore &s;hall only add that,</P>

<P>AS happine&s;s is the pur&s;uit of every body, it is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;o few of us arrive at this univer&s;al goal of human de&s;ire, and &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing that when we &s;ee the various quick&s;ands upon which the expectations of others have been &s;hipwrecked in &s;teering to this favourite point, that we are not a little more cautious in the direction of our own cour&s;e, e&s;pecially as &s;ome|thing more than a temporary felicity re&s;ts upon our attention, and the tran&s;ports of a future life immediately depend upon the rectitude of our con|duct in this.</P>
<P>THE principal rea&s;on why the generality of the world are di&s;appointed in their &s;earch after happi|ne&s;s, &s;eems to me to be that &s;trange infatuation, of placing our highe&s;t felicity in objects which are either weak or vicious in them&s;elves, and which con&s;equently our rea&s;on upon a &s;ober con&s;ideration mu&s;t either de&s;pi&s;e or dete&s;t. &mdash; A man who&s;e ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="132" REF="141">
wi&s;hes are centered in the luxuries of a fa&s;hi|onable table, mu&s;t be mi&s;erable the moment he is incapable of emptying another plate: he who has no other comfort in life than his bottle, mu&s;t be robbed of his &s;ummum bonum the in&s;tant he is &s;tretched upon the floor; and he who&s;e de&s;ires are ab&s;orbed in &s;till greater &s;en&s;ualities, mu&s;t be equally unfortunate the moment tho&s;e de&s;ires have been in|dulged: in fact, every pur&s;uit of this nature is ren|dered lifele&s;s and in&s;ipid by it's very gratification, till continual repetitions &s;o deaden the appetite; (to &s;ay not a &s;yllable of con&s;equences,) that experience makes us exclaim with the wi&s;e&s;t fool that ever exi&s;ted,
<Q>All is vanity under the &s;un.</Q></P>
<P>WERE we however to make rea&s;on the guide of our actions, in&s;tead of being eternally directed by inclination, our enjoyments would always be cer|tain; and recollection would afford us the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction, in&s;tead of filling us ince&s;&s;antly with mortification and di&s;gu&s;t; for in reality, if we think but ever &s;o ha&s;tily on the affair, we &s;hall find that no object can promi&s;e us the &s;malle&s;t glimmer of real felicity which is repugnant to the &s;entiments of virtue; it is from the rectitude of our conduct only that we are to look for any hap|pine&s;s at all; and &s;urely when we give an un|bounded loo&s;e to every depravity of inclination, it is a degree of ab&s;olute madne&s;s to expect the &s;elf-approving te&s;timony of our own con&s;cience to the
<PB N="133" REF="142">
very actions which that con&s;cience cannot but highly di&s;countenance and condemn.</P>
<P>THE glittering noi&s;e, and pompous bu&s;tle of the world, may for a time perhaps lull the &s;enti|ments of rea&s;on, or cry "hu&s;h" to the pleadings of con&s;cience, but can never entirely &s;ubdue either: in the moments of retirement the mo&s;t hardened of us all are dragged up in turn before the bar of our own minds, and the deity which pre&s;ides there pronounces a ju&s;t though a &s;evere &s;entence on every breach of morality and virtue. &mdash; Callous as we endeavour to make our&s;elves, that &s;entence &s;crews it&s;elf in the memory; clouds the eye amid&s;t all the &s;plendor of the drawing room; and harrows up the very &s;oul in the warme&s;t &s;un&s;hine of a court. Where is the man who can &s;ay he has never ac|knowledged the omnipotence of con&s;cience? Where is he who can affirm he has not, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion, been condemned by the deity of his own bo&s;om, and doomed to a tempo|rary perdition in his mind? Stand out ye fa&s;hion|able denyers of another exi&s;tence; come forth ye daring bla&s;phemers of your God &mdash; from the irre|&s;i&s;table &s;omething, which acquits or condemns during this life in your brea&s;ts, learn to believe that there is a &s;overeign di&s;po&s;er of all things in the next, who will decide with an equal &s;everity and ju&s;tice; and that the power of the divinity which you experience &s;o frequently below, is no|thing but a faint re&s;emblance of that authority,
<PB N="134" REF="143">
which at the dreadful day of account you mu&s;t meet with above.</P>
<P>I AM very frequently amazed (ab&s;tracted from every con&s;ideration of future happine&s;s) that the mere dictates of &s;elf concern for the felicity of the pre&s;ent, does not generally induce us to follow &s;uch pur&s;uits as are certain to give us a real &s;atis|faction while they engage us; and &s;ure in their con&s;equences of e&s;tabli&s;hing not only an encrea&s;e of hone&s;t reputation, but a &s;ource of inconceivable content. &mdash; Was the libertine, in&s;tead of &s;quan|dering thou&s;ands to de&s;troy &s;ome un&s;u&s;pecting in|nocent, to employ a fiftieth part of the &s;um in her protection &mdash; what a foundation would he lay for arriving at that goal, which his very gredine&s;s after happine&s;s de&s;troys in the contrary cour&s;e? &mdash; Was the mi&s;er, in&s;tead of hoarding up u&s;ele&s;s mil|lions, to expend a little of his wealth in wiping away the &s;orrows from affliction and di&s;tre&s;s; the action would be it's own reward, and he would own that if he went to the proper market, happi|ne&s;s was to be purcha&s;ed at a very rea&s;onable price: In &s;hort, if mankind would con&s;ider that virtue and vice create their own heaven and hell even on this &s;ide the grave, the principal part of us would endeavour to act in &s;uch a manner as would enable them to look with confidence beyond it, and experience in this world &s;ome tollerable idea of that felicity which is prepared to await the righteous in the next.</P>

<P>I HAVE often remarked that one half of the plea&s;ures &s;o eagerly pro&s;ecuted by the gene|rality of mankind, if changed in their appellations, and ranked under the denomination of labour, would be &s;hunned with as much a&s;&s;iduity as they are now followed, and rendered every whit as di&s;|gu&s;tful to the fancy as they are now flattering and agreeable. Through &s;ome unaccountable infatu|ation we are ravi&s;hed in the literary &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion, with the whi&s;tling of a name, and infinitely fatigue our&s;elves more in the bare pur&s;uit of our &s;everal amu&s;ements, than in the clo&s;e&s;t atten|tion to the duties of our re&s;pective vocations, though the&s;e evocations are the only means which we have of rai&s;ing a nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for our families.</P>
<P>THE truth of this po&s;ition was never more evidently a&s;certained than in the character of poor Bob Beetle. Bob is engaged in a very exten&s;ive way of bu&s;ine&s;s; and is, at once, the mo&s;t lazy and the mo&s;t indu&s;trious fellow alive: he is fa|tigued to death if he writes a few lines to a cor|re&s;pondent, but he will ride after a pack of dogs for a dozen hours together, and call it glorious &s;port, when he has ventured his neck over a &s;core or two of gates, and come home as dirty as a ducked pick-pocket, from a forty miles chace in the middle of winter. When he is in town
<PB N="136" REF="145">
he complains of it as a prodigious hard&s;hip if he ri&s;es at ten o'clock in the morning, though in the country he makes no &s;cruple what&s;oever to get up at three or four to drag a fi&s;h-pond; and will &s;carcely walk a &s;treet's length to receive a hundred pounds in the way of his bu&s;ine&s;s, though he would trudge eight or ten miles with the greate&s;t &s;atis|faction after a brace of partridges. I met Bob a few days ago in the city, and &s;topping him on the privilege of an old acquaintance, demanded what was the rea&s;on of his &s;eeming out of temper: &mdash; <Q>Seeming, (repeated he) Mr. Babler, it is more than &s;eeming; I am half inclined to hang my|&s;elf: here in &s;uch a roa&s;ting day as this mu&s;t I trundle to Change, and broil for two whole hours under the inten&s;e heat of a perpendicular &s;un. Damn it, Sir, I lead the life of a galley &s;lave, and it is better not to live at all than be liable to &s;uch continual anxieties.</Q> I was ill-natured enough to &s;mile at his di&s;tre&s;s; but giving him a cordial &s;hake by the hand, I wi&s;hed him a good morning and &s;o we parted. Next day about twelve o'clock going to dine at a relations near Hammer&s;mith, who &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d I &s;ee &s;tripped and playing at cricket in a field near Ken&s;ington, but Bob: though the weather was rather warmer than when I met him the preceding day, he was engaged in that violent exerci&s;e with all the ap|pearance of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction, and &s;coured after the ball with as much agility as he could po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e to get him&s;elf into heat on a fro&s;ty morning.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146">IF we take but ever &s;o &s;light a &s;urvey of mankind, we &s;hall find that mo&s;t people are actu|ated pretty much in the &s;ame manner with my friend Bob Beetle. Looking upon that as an in|&s;upportable toil which is mo&s;t conducive to their intere&s;t, they ab&s;olutely find a plea&s;ure in fatigue, and run into downright labour in hopes of enjoy|ing a little recreation. I would by no means be under&s;tood as an arguer again&s;t a moderate &s;hare of manly exerci&s;e or rational amu&s;ement: on the contrary, I look upon &s;uch relaxations to be e&s;|&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, both becau&s;e they add con&s;i|derably to our health, and give us a fre&s;h incli|nation of returning to the bu&s;ine&s;s of our various employments. What I am offended at is, to &s;ee men of excellent under&s;tandings in total oppo|&s;ition to the dictates of their good &s;en&s;e, apply|ing them&s;elves wholly to the pro&s;ecution of their plea&s;ures, and creating a number af imaginary difficulties, to imbitter every moment which they &s;et apart for the management of their mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary employments.</P>
<P>WERE temporal concerns, however, the only ones which we &s;acrifice to our idle&s;t, nay to our mo&s;t culpable, amu&s;ements, &s;omething &s;till might be &s;aid in our defence; but our happine&s;s here|after, as well as our intere&s;ts here, is obliged to give way to the meane&s;t di&s;&s;ipations; and a fox cha&s;e or a cricket ball; a hunting-match or a dice-box, are not only able to &s;tifle every impul&s;e of regard which we ought to entertain for our
<PB N="138" REF="147">
families, but every &s;entiment of adoration which we ought to entertain for our God. The duties of religion, like our dome&s;tic concerns, are utterly neglected; and even the awful bu&s;ine&s;s of eternity is thrown a&s;ide, for a contemptible game at whi&s;t, or a de&s;picable pack of hounds.</P>
<P>THE parallel between the neglect of our tem|poral and &s;piritual concerns, will be found con|&s;iderable &s;tronger, when we recollect that where unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity compels a momentary at|tention to either, we enter upon them with an equal degree of reluctance and ill-will. But in the con&s;equence, however, there is the wide&s;t difference: our di&s;inclination does not often in|terrupt the bu&s;ine&s;s of our callings, while we continue in oppo&s;ition to the natural bent of our tempers to carry it on; many a man though he hates his profe&s;&s;ion, neverthele&s;s by &s;ubduing his antipathy to it, and managing his affairs with di&s;cretion, makes a good fortune: but let us be never &s;o diligent in the di&s;charge of our religious obligations, yet if our hearts are not actually en|gaged in the &s;ervice of our Creator, all our per|&s;onal attendance on his wor&s;hip, will be &s;o far from availing us, that it will rather encrea&s;e the enormity of our guilt, and expo&s;e us more ine|vitably to the thunders of his hand. Reluctance is an aggravation of our crime, and we become le&s;s and le&s;s excu&s;able, the more we appear in his temple, unle&s;s we approach it with the mo&s;t exalted fervency of inclination. Let us be care|ful,
<PB N="139" REF="148">
therefore, whenever we &s;teal an hour from the ely&s;ium of our amu&s;ements, and conde&s;cend to enter a church, that we do not &s;uffer &s;o pre|cious a part of our time to be lo&s;t. Let us take the greate&s;t pains we are able to prevent that hour from being an evidence again&s;t us at the dreadful day of judgment; and con&s;ider in the language of the Poet;
<Q><L>That unle&s;s we de&s;i&s;t from our crimes;</L>

<P>CONVERSING ye&s;terday with an old acquaintance on the vanity of human wi&s;hes, we fell in&s;en&s;ibly into a long di&s;cour&s;e about the ab&s;urdities of mankind, even in their be&s;t actions; and particularly dwelt upon the in|&s;olence of their very devotion, when, though they affect to &s;ubmit them&s;elves entirely to the re&s;ignation of providence, they neverthele&s;s pre|&s;ume to point out immediate objects for the ex|erci&s;e of the Divine Benignity, without once re|collecting that the nature of their reque&s;t may be totally oppo&s;ite both to the greatne&s;s of it's wi&s;dom, and the ju&s;tice of it's laws.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of conver&s;ation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me &s;o very much upon my going to bed, that it con|tinued to employ my imagination, and I dreamt how Jupiter took me up to the &s;kies, as he was
<PB N="140" REF="149">
&s;aid to have formerly done by Menippus the phi|lo&s;opher, in order that I might be convinced the accu&s;ations &s;o generally brought again&s;t the equity of providence, were totally without foun|dation; and that the great author of the univer&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the impious murmurs of his crea|tures, was perfectly ju&s;t, and con&s;i&s;tent in the mi|nute&s;t of his decrees.</P>
<P>HAVING taken my &s;tation, as I fancied, at the feet of the Deity, the chry&s;tal gates of the cele&s;tial region were thrown wide open, and by a particular order of Jupiter, the &s;ofte&s;t whi&s;per addre&s;&s;ed to him from earth was &s;o di&s;tinctly heard, that during the continuance of the various &s;up|plications, I never mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ingle &s;yllable.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t who offered up his prayers to Olym|pus, was a man who had been ruined by being a &s;ecurity in a large &s;um of money for a very intimate friend. <Q>This, (&s;ays Jupiter, turning to me) is a fellow of unque&s;tionable worth and integrity; through the whole cour&s;e of his life he has paid &s;o inflexible an attention to the dic|tates of virtue, that I do not believe I have any thing to charge him with, be&s;ides a human infirmity. He thinks it hard, therefore, that I &s;hould &s;uffer him to be plunged into di&s;tre&s;s, though this di&s;tre&s;s is nothing more than the natural con&s;equence of his own indi&s;cretion; for in&s;tead of building his e&s;teem upon the ho|ne&s;ty of the man by who&s;e means he is thus unhappily &s;tripped of his all, he founded his regard
<PB N="141" REF="150">
entirely upon the length of their acquaintance; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, not becau&s;e he was a per&s;on of probity and honour, but becau&s;e he was a per&s;on with whom he generally cracked a bottle in an evening, and took a &s;ociable pipe. On this account he is ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for his folly; and though I intend to reward his virtues very amply in this world, yet I mu&s;t permit him to be cha&s;tized below, that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her worthy men may take warning by his example, and learn to &s;hower their favours upon tho&s;e only whom they know to be truly de&s;erving.</Q></P>
<P>THE next per&s;on who offered up his petition, was a merchant in the City, who prayed devoutly for a fair wind, for a &s;hip which he had richly laden in the river, and intended for a very valu|able market on the coa&s;t of Africa. <Q>Now here (re&s;umed Jupiter) is another very hone&s;t fellow, who will think him&s;elf particularly aggrieved if I decline to comply with his reque&s;t; and yet if I was to grant it, a thou&s;and others would inevitably be ruined, who are bound upon voyages that require quite a contrary wind. Your people of virtue imagine that they &s;hould in the minute&s;t circum&s;tance be the particular care of providence, and ab&s;urdly fancy that the attention of a Being, who has the whole univer&s;e to govern and &s;upport, &s;hould be entirely engro&s;&s;ed by them&s;elves. The &s;epeo|ple mu&s;t however, be informed, that I am the God of an exten&s;ive world, and not the im|mediate patron of any one man. Of cour&s;e,
<PB N="142" REF="151">
therefore, I &s;hall never invert the order of things to oblige a private per&s;on, though that per&s;on &s;hould be the very be&s;t of all my votaries; more particularly too when let his merits be what they will, my favour &s;hall &s;o incredibly exceed them in the end.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER the departure of the Merchant, I thought a whole kingdom came at once, and begged of Jupiter to de&s;troy a neighbouring na|tion with whom they happened to be at war. <Q>Here are precious fellows for you; (cried Ju|piter) and &s;o I mu&s;t &s;acrifice a country of ten or twelve millions, merely becau&s;e their con&s;ci|entious votaries think proper to make the re|que&s;t; that is in plain Engli&s;h, I mu&s;t be their bully, and arm my&s;elf in pa&s;&s;ions, that would di&s;grace the meane&s;t of them&s;elves, for the mighty honour of executing the purpo&s;es of their revenge.</Q> Jupiter upon this turned his head a&s;ide with indignation, and bid me ob&s;erve another body of people, rather larger than the former, who were &s;inging hymns to his prai&s;e, and invoking his favour with all the energy of the mo&s;t &s;olemn adoration. <Q>This (&s;ays he) is the nation with whom my late &s;et of worthies are at war; and you hear they are ju&s;t praying in the &s;ame manner that I would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to cut the throats of all their enemies. Now which of the&s;e mu&s;t I oblige? Their preten&s;ions to my regard are alike in&s;ignificant; and they are quarreling for a tract of country
<PB N="143" REF="152">
in America, to which neither of them have the &s;malle&s;t right. To puni&s;h therefore, both their in|ju&s;tice to the poor Americans, and their in&s;olence in thinking to make me an abettor of their in|famous contention, I &s;hall leave them entirely to them&s;elves, and make each by that means the &s;courge of the others crimes.</Q> Jupiter de|livered the&s;e la&s;t words in a tone &s;o tremendous, that I awoke with affright; but recollecting the various circum&s;tances of my dream, I thought it would make no indifferent paper, as it taught &s;o ab&s;olute a re&s;ignation to the awful di&s;pen&s;ations of God.</P>

<P>HYPOCRISY for the honour of the pre|&s;ent age, is a crime &s;o very little practi&s;ed, that people are not at the trouble of concealing their follies or their vices, but generou&s;ly run into the mo&s;t palpable mi&s;takes, or the mo&s;t culpable errors in the full face of day; and even expect that we &s;hould look upon this exalted di&s;regard of &s;hame, as a mark of the highe&s;t candour and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>FOR my own part however, I &s;hould be glad if the generality of mankind were le&s;s ingenuous in this re&s;pect, &s;ince &s;o open a commi&s;&s;ion of our faults mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e vice into a &s;ort of re|putation, and e&s;tabli&s;h an example to the la&s;t de|gree
<PB N="144" REF="153">
prejudicial to po&s;terity. Hypocri&s;y therefore &s;o far as it regarded a concealment of our faults, I &s;hould look upon as a &s;ort of negative virtue, becau&s;e though it did not extenuate our own errors, it neverthele&s;s prevented us from debauching the principles of other people.</P>
<P>THE great misfortune of the pre&s;ent age is, that the univer&s;al force of example has rendered a number of the mo&s;t atrocious crimes ab&s;olutely fa&s;hionable; formerly it was looked upon as in|famous to the la&s;t degree, if a man alienated the affection of an acquaintance's wife, or plunged a dagger into the bo&s;om of a friend. Now-a-days it is impo&s;&s;ible for a young fellow to be allowed a dawn of &s;pirit, unle&s;s he has de&s;troyed his woman, or killed his man, and trampled upon every in|&s;titute which ought to be &s;acred to &s;ociety. Nay, to &s;uch a height are matters at pre&s;ent carried; that we often boa&s;t of our crimes as if they were &s;o many virtues, and recount with an air of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction, how many times we have been drunk within the cour&s;e of the week; how many &s;trumpets we have vi&s;ited, or how many times we have endangered our lives in the mid|night di&s;putes of a common brothel. If any body is &s;en&s;ible enough to decline accompanying us on the&s;e pretty expeditions, we &s;et him down as a &s;piritle&s;s ignorant milk&s;op, equally de&s;titute of-ambition and under&s;tanding. What is more, in proportion as he manife&s;ts a repugnance to join
<PB N="145" REF="154">
in our extravagances, in proportion we turn him into a ridicule, and load him with the mo&s;t in|&s;uperable contempt, where we ought to honour him with the greate&s;t &s;hare of our admiration.</P>
<P>BUT what in the cour&s;e of general ob&s;erva|tion a&s;toni&s;hes me mo&s;t is, that a man &s;hall claim a right to be profligate, in proportion as we allow him to be &s;en&s;ible; and think him&s;elf entitled to be vicious, according to the e&s;timate which we make of his under&s;tanding. Nothing is more common now-a-days, than to prai&s;e our intimate friends in &s;omething like the following manner; <HI>Why to be &s;ure Tom or Jack &s;uch a one is a very wicked dog, but then he's no fool;</HI> thus that very good &s;en&s;e which &s;hould be con&s;idered as an aggravation of his conduct, is looked upon as an extenuation at lea&s;t, and we think him entirely ju&s;tified in the mo&s;t criminal undertakings, in proportion as he is really without the &s;hadow of excu&s;e.</P>
<P>SOME people indeed who affect to po&s;&s;e&s;s an extraordinary &s;hare of principle, propo&s;e a limi|tation to ther vices, and make a &s;ort of agree|ment with their own con&s;ciences, not to be wicked above &s;uch a certain number of years. The pe|riod which they fix for the date of their reforma|tion, is generally the day of marriage; without ever reflecting on the po&s;&s;ibility of never living to this period, they go on in an uninterrupted cour&s;e of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and imagine they may with propriety di&s;turb the peace of every other per&s;on's family, till they have actually got a family of
<PB N="146" REF="155">
their own; nor does a parent or a guardian once &s;uppo&s;e any of the&s;e worthy gentlemen an im|proper match for their daughters or their wards, on account of their profe&s;&s;ed profligacy; on the contrary, it is a received opinion, that a reformed rake makes the be&s;t hu&s;band, and that he is the propere&s;t companion in life for a woman of virtue and honour, who never before had an acquaint|ance with a woman of virtue or honour at all.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e con&s;iderations on the prodigious encouragement which vice &s;o ince&s;&s;antly receives from the force of example, I am led to be an ad|vocate for hypocri&s;y, and induced to wi&s;h, that tho&s;e who are too wi&s;e or too &s;pirited to be rea|&s;oned out of their errors, would at lea&s;t be humane enough to practice them with &s;ome &s;hare of cau|tion, that they may not &s;educe others from the &s;entiments of virtue, nor be in&s;trumental in the de&s;truction of any body but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I AM very &s;en&s;ible how extremely unfa&s;hionable it is for a writer to pre&s;s any con&s;iderations of a future &s;tate upon the mind of an elegant reader. Now-a-days, it is indelicate to talk of eternity with any kind of weight, and repugnant to every &s;entiment of politene&s;s, for a man to &s;peak with the &s;malle&s;t veneration of his God. Yet &s;urely, as long as we are &s;en&s;ible upon how precarious a tenure our exi&s;tence depends, we &s;hould now and then think that a day of account will come; and where we are &s;o certain of our mortality, we ought to recollect that we are &s;ometime to die.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GRATITUDE is a quality of &s;o bewitch|ing a nature, that we generally look upon it as a complication of all the virtues, and &s;uppo&s;e that no man can be de&s;titute of any other, who is happily in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this; yet amiable &s;oever as it is univer&s;ally con&s;idered, perhaps there is no excellence in the catalogue &s;o little &s;tudied, or for which in general we entertain &s;o unaccountable a contempt.</P>
<P>IN former ages, an attention to the dictates of gratitude was reckoned an indi&s;pen&s;ible part of our duty, and nothing was looked upon in a more dete&s;table light than an in&s;en&s;ibility of favours, or an unworthy return where we had been in the lea&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="157">
obliged; one particular &s;pecies of gratitude was held inviolably &s;acred, and the Romans were &s;o re|ligiou&s;ly punctual in the performance of it, that they put the offender's life in the power of his be|nefactor, wherever they &s;aw it tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tance where the Romans puni&s;hed the want of gratitude with &s;uch &s;everity, was the breach or neglect of that tenderne&s;s and affection which was indi&s;pen&s;ibly due to a father from a &s;on: That &s;en&s;ible people judiciou&s;ly con&s;idered, that if a man could behave with ingratitude to a parent that had endued him with no le&s;s a ble&s;&s;ing than his very exi&s;tence, he mu&s;t be dead to every &s;en&s;e of obligations from any other quarter; and fancied that a per&s;on capable of bur&s;ting through the mo&s;t &s;acred ordinances of nature, was capable of bur&s;t|ing through the mo&s;t &s;acred of &s;ociety too; from this principle, in the early ages of that celebrated republic, a father was inve&s;ted with an ab&s;olute authority over the lives of his children, and he that was not a good &s;on, was univer&s;ally looked upon as a bad member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THOUGH we are perhaps the only nation in Europe who retain any part of the Roman freedom, yet perhaps we are the only one which does not retain a glimmer of its exalted &s;entiments in this re&s;pect; for with us, &s;mall a portion of gratitude as we &s;till continue to keep up, a parent is the only per&s;on in the world to whom we think it utterly unnece&s;&s;ary to be &s;hewn; as if he who was entitled to the greate&s;t &s;hare, &s;hould be the only one de|nied
<PB N="149" REF="158">
a mark of it at all. &mdash; Nay, to &s;o prepo&s;terous a length is the general opinion hurried away in this point, that a man who lends us a &s;ingle guinea to riot in exce&s;s and &s;en&s;uality, &s;hall receive much greater in&s;tances of our gratitude, than an indul|gent parent who toils during a whole life for our welfare, and makes a comfortable e&s;tabli&s;hment for us and our po&s;terity.</P>
<P>IT is a received notion among the generality of people, that a &s;on is no way obliged to his father for any tokens of affection which he may receive, becau&s;e the old gentleman finds a particular &s;atis|faction in providing for his happine&s;s, and is &s;uffi|ciently repaid, if he &s;ees his &s;olicitude attended with the de&s;ired effects. &mdash; Alas! Mr. Babler, what &s;entiments are we to entertain of people who rea&s;on in any manner like this? Does it follow, that becau&s;e a parent finds a plea&s;ure in the per|formance of his duty, that a &s;on &s;hould think him|&s;elf exempted from the nece&s;&s;ary pro&s;ecution of his? The very plea&s;ure which is here pleaded as a &s;ufficient reward for the affection of the father, is to the la&s;t degree an aggravation of ingratitude in the &s;on, and in&s;tead of palliating the breach of his filial affection, leaves him without a po&s;ibility of excu&s;e; for &s;urely tho&s;e who take a plea&s;ure in the promotion of our happine&s;s mu&s;t be doubly entitled to our gratitude, and we ought to feel a glow of veneration ari&s;ing from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their motives, as much as from the actual be|nefits them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="159">FOR my own part, Mr. Babler, I am perfectly of opinion with the primitive Romans, that an un|grateful &s;on can never make a good man; the ties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between father and child are of a nature &s;o inconceivably delicate, that he, who is capable of bur&s;ting them a&s;under, is incapable of being bound either by gratitude or honour to any body el&s;e. &mdash; It is incredible, Sir, to think the numberle&s;s hours of anxiety a parent mu&s;t endure before he can rear a &s;on to maturity. &mdash; It is incredible to think after he has even brought him to years of di&s;cretion, how uncea&s;ingly &s;olicitous he is, le&s;t &s;ome unfore&s;een calamity &s;hould bla&s;t the harve&s;t of his happine&s;s, and cut him unrelentingly off: and what does a parent require for all this? What does he demand for the gifts of life, education, and fortune, which he has &s;o liberally be&s;towed, but that the &s;on will pay a little attention to his own intere&s;t, and treat the hand to which he is &s;o emi|nently obliged, with tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect?</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing cur&s;ory reflexions, Mr. Babler, if filial ingratitude &s;hould of all other crimes appear the mo&s;t odious, let me addre&s;s my|&s;elf to the bo&s;oms of our youth, and for their own &s;akes, reque&s;t they will immediately &s;hake it off; le&s;t in their own old age, providence might be plea&s;ed to make them know in the emphatic lan|guage of the poet:

<P>NOTHING is &s;o general a topic with all the old fellows of my acquaintance, as the de|pravity of the pre&s;ent times, and the vi&s;ible de|generacy of manners &s;ince they them&s;elves were at the blooming age of five and twenty, and &s;hone away in a &s;plendid round of the various fa&s;hion|able amu&s;ements. For my own part, though pretty far advanced in the vale of years, I am not altoge|ther &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately attached to my juvenile days, as not to be &s;en&s;ible that we had as many follies and vices among us then, as the &s;evere&s;t &s;atiri&s;t now exi&s;ting can po&s;&s;ibly point out; nor am I &s;o complai&s;ant to the pre&s;ent period as not to &s;ee that there is the greate&s;t room, as well as the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, both to be a&s;hamed and to amend. In &s;hort, the world, with regard to vice and virtue, is pretty much the &s;ame as it was five hundred years ago; and probably for five hundred years to come, it will &s;till continue to be actuated by the &s;ame motives, however it may differ in the man|ner or the means.</P>
<P>GREATLY &s;oever as we may imagine human nature to be degenerated, yet if we take but a flight &s;urvey of mankind, we &s;hall find the principal number of our vices and follies to be rather the con&s;equence of our incon&s;ideration, than the effect of an ab&s;olute badne&s;s of heart. We are weak and
<PB N="152" REF="161">
vicious more through the levity of temper and the prevalence of example, than either a narrowne&s;s of under&s;tanding or a depravity of inclination; and it is by denying our&s;elves time to examine either the ab&s;urdity of our mo&s;t favourite pur&s;uits, or the danger of a &s;lavi&s;h obedience to fa&s;hion, that we &s;o generally become the objects of our own dete&s;tation or contempt. In&s;tead of making rea&s;on the guide of our actions, we are directed by ex|ample; and in&s;tead of enquiring how far &s;uch and &s;uch a behaviour may be agreeable to the &s;entiments of virtue, we never a&s;k any que&s;tion, but how far it is con&s;i&s;tent with the cu&s;tom of the times; hence we drink, fight, &s;wear, and run through the whole catalogues of vices and follies, not &s;o much becau&s;e we like drinking, fighting or &s;wearing, as to avoid the appearance of &s;ingularity; and ri&s;que not only our happine&s;s in this world, but our ever|la&s;ting &s;alvation in the next, for no other rea&s;on but to join in with the croud, and &s;eem of the &s;ame &s;tamp with the general run of people.</P>
<P>KITT HAIRBRAIN is a young fellow of many good qualities, and has a heart as ready to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his fellow creatures as any man of my acquaintance; yet Kitt would look upon it as the greate&s;t in&s;ult imaginable, if you &s;uppo&s;ed he was not at any time willing to cut the throat of his mo&s;t intimate companion, and to debauch the wife or &s;i&s;ter of his neare&s;t friend; not but he would feel the utmo&s;t reluctance in the perpetration of either, and be &s;en&s;ible, that it was a very un|pardonable
<PB N="153" REF="162">
crime; but the force of example gets the better of his humanity, and he is le&s;s afraid of a laugh from a fool or a villain, than the eternal di&s;plea&s;ure of his God.</P>
<P>ASK Kitt how he reconciles this behaviour, and he will an&s;wer by the force of example too &mdash; <Q>Damn it, (will he reply) I am &s;ure I am no wor&s;e than Bob Brazen, Dick Dare, Will Wildfire, and a thou&s;and others of my acquaint|ance;</Q> and thus as long as he finds any body as bad or wor&s;e than him&s;elf, cries hu&s;h to every argument of his rea&s;on, and goes on in the com|mi&s;&s;ion of new follies, or the perpetration of new crimes. Sometimes he compounds matters, and opens a &s;ort of debtor and creditor account be|tween his con&s;cience and him&s;elf, with which he is not a little &s;atisfied; as for in&s;tance: becau&s;e he pays his debts punctually, he imagines he has no occa&s;ion ever to appear at the public wor&s;hip of his creator: becau&s;e he frequently relieves one poor family, he looks upon him&s;elf as ju&s;tified in plunging another into the wor&s;t of di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;grace; and becau&s;e he &s;ometimes fulfils the du|ties of chri&s;tianity, he fancies that in the general he has a right to make a je&s;t of them all.</P>
<P>ALAS, how many Kitt Hairbrains might be found on an accurate in&s;pection through the king|dom? &mdash; If the pre&s;ent paper &s;hould fall into any &s;uch hands, let me, if I cannot make an appeal to their rea&s;on, at lea&s;t addre&s;s an admonition to their pride, and advi&s;e them, if they mu&s;t follow the
<PB N="154" REF="163">
example of their neighbours, to copy tho&s;e actions only which are worthy of imitation and regard; &s;ince nothing but wi&s;dom or virtue can vindicate the credit of our under&s;tandings in an imitation of any nature; and &s;ince he mu&s;t be an ideot or mad|man, who treads in no other foot&s;teps than tho&s;e which are marked by the ra&s;cal or the fool.</P>

<P>THOUGH nothing is &s;o common as to find every man di&s;&s;atisfied with the lot in which providence has thought proper to place him, yet nothing is &s;o certain, as that no man, take his &s;ituation all in all, would be his neighbour in|&s;tead of being him&s;elf. The great father of the univer&s;e has graciou&s;ly planted an inherent &s;ort of pride in the brea&s;t of all his creatures, which exalts them in their own opinion, and gives them an advantage over the re&s;t of the world in &s;ome particular point that compen&s;ates for a thou&s;and inconveniencies, and reconciles them to the &s;eve|rity of real or imaginary evils upon the whole.</P>
<P>IF we examine the frame of the human mind, we &s;hall immediately &s;ee, that every man holds much the &s;ame opinion of him&s;elf which he en|tertains of his country; he readily acknowledges, that in &s;ome particular circum&s;tances &s;uch and &s;uch a per&s;on has an advantage of him, but in the main he neverthele&s;s thinks him&s;elf the &s;uperior, and

looks down with an air of di&s;dain on all who are hardy enough to di&s;pute his opinion: a modern author has not de&s;cribed this &s;ort of vanity un|happily.</P>

<P>I WAS conver&s;ing with my nephew Harry la&s;t night upon this &s;ubject, and the young rogue made an ob&s;ervation or two that gave me much &s;atis|faction. I don't know how it is, Sir, &s;ays he, but though my acquaintance are everla&s;tingly wrang|ling with them&s;elves, I can find none of them, upon a fair examination, willing to be any body el&s;e. There's Ned Grovely, for in&s;tance, who is perpetually cur&s;ing his &s;tars for not giving him a good e&s;tate like Dick Bumper; yet at the &s;ame time, the univer&s;e would not bribe him to make an exchange with Dick for legs. In the &s;ame manner Dick is very mi&s;erable at the clum&s;ine&s;s of his calves, but neverthele&s;s hugs him&s;elf up in the recollection that he can drink as much as any man in England at a &s;itting, and play an ad|mirable game at all-fours.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="165">YOU know Sally Bromley in Pall-Mall who vi&s;its at my mother's, and is &s;o terribly pitted with the &s;mall pox; Sally is to the la&s;t degree unhappy on that account, and envies every woman with a tolerable face; yet I have heard her frequently declare, that a fine &s;et of teeth was the fir&s;t of all the beauties; and then ob&s;erved how &s;he turned round to receive the univer&s;al admiration with as much confidence as if &s;he was an ab&s;olute dutche&s;s of Hamilton. In &s;hort, let me go where I will, I can find nobody but what is the <HI>rara avis</HI> of &s;elf-imagination: neither poverty nor di&s;ea&s;e can eradicate the con&s;equential &s;omething of the bo&s;om that lifts us to the pinnacle of di&s;tinction, and gives us &s;o great a pre-eminence above our neigh|bours.

<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the&s;e various foundations for happine&s;s, which providence has planted in the minds of all its creatures, we cannot help ad|miring the goodne&s;s of the divine Being, in mak|ing our very foibles a &s;ource of felicity, and creat|ing &s;uch fountains of &s;atisfaction from &s;uch in|con&s;iderable means. What gratitude is there not then due to &s;o all-&s;ufficiently wi&s;e and beneficent a hand! Devotion it&s;elf is lo&s;t in admiration at &s;o

&s;tupenduous a bounty, and &s;carcely knows which mo&s;t to wonder or adore.</P>

Unfa&s;hionable as the doctrine of virtue and mo|rality may appear, experience however fully con|vinces us, that nothing el&s;e can lay a &s;olid foun|dation for happine&s;s, and that every other ba&s;is is, literally &s;peaking, building on the &s;and, and gra&s;p|ing alone at emptine&s;s and air.</P>

<P>IT was a very &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervation of Sir Richard Steel's, that in order to make a good fortune, it was nece&s;&s;ary to carry the appearance of an ea&s;y one. &mdash; The generality of mankind are always ready to re&s;pect us in proportion as they think us opulent; and pay a veneration to our circum|&s;tances which they frequently refu&s;e to our&s;elves: neither the mo&s;t excellent under&s;tanding, nor the mo&s;t benevolent heart are ever treated with half the deference which the arrogant &s;well of fortune receives at our hands; and we even pau&s;e with a degree of reverence at the mention of ten thou&s;and
<PB N="158" REF="167">
pounds, when we &s;peak with the greate&s;t fami|liarity of omnipotence, and je&s;t with the awful maje&s;ty of our God.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t whim&s;ical fellow of this ca&s;t with whom I ever have been acquainted, was poor Ralph Harper; Ralph had an unaccountable re&s;|pect for rich men, though he never expected to reap a &s;ingle &s;ixpence from the happine&s;s of their circum&s;tances; and, though utterly out of bu&s;ine&s;s he would not be a day ab&s;ent from change for the univer&s;e; it did him good, he affirmed, to &s;ee &s;uch a number of rich people a&s;&s;embled to|gether, and the &s;ure&s;t way in the world of gain|ing his heart was, to introduce him to any body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large fortune. Whenever he met with a &s;trange face in company, in&s;tead of a&s;king about character, the con&s;tant que&s;tion was, <HI>what is he worth?</HI> and in&s;tead of an enquiry about good &s;en&s;e, he never troubled him&s;elf about any thing but what his name would bring at the bottom of a piece of paper. For a man with twenty thou|&s;and pounds he had always a low bow; for one of fifty, a profound reverence; but if he found a per&s;on in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a plumb, he was ready to pay him an implicit adoration. This unaccount|able peculiarity he frequently carried to very ridi|culous extremes. One day, in particular, he met me in the city, and upon the &s;core of an old friend|&s;hip, in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould go home with him and eat a bit of mutton; I con&s;ented, but unhappily, as we came down Cheap&s;ide, he &s;aw a &s;ober quaker
<PB N="159" REF="168">
on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet, who kept a tal|low chandler's &s;hop &s;omewhere in the neighbour|hood of Barbican; on this gentleman he had no &s;ooner fixed his eye, than totally forgetting that I was his gue&s;t, he broke from me with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, &s;aying, <Q>My dear Mr. Babler, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me; yonder is a per&s;on worth thirty thou&s;and pounds, whom I would not mi&s;s &s;peak|ing to for the world; he has a&s;ked me repeat|edly to dine with him, and I think now is as good a time as can be &mdash; God ble&s;s you, I &s;up|po&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee you at the club in the evening.</Q></P>
<P>I COULD not help laughing very heartily at Ralph's manner of behaving; and having nothing particular to do, I took it into my head to follow him as clo&s;e as I conveniently could without being ob&s;erved. I had not, however, gone above a hun|dred yards, before he gave an in&s;tant &s;pring acro&s;s the kennel, to a fre&s;h face, and calling out to his little friend the Quaker, de&s;ired him to go on, for it was out of his power to dine with him that day, having &s;ome very pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act, which till then had entirely e&s;caped his memory. I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected that this new acquaintance was a man of rather greater fortune than the per&s;on for whom I had been &s;o &s;trangely di&s;carded; I was not deceived in my conjecture; he &s;toped to &s;peak to &s;omebody and Ralph likewi&s;e making a halt to wait for him, happened to meet my eye, and gave me a glance of no little &s;ignificance. As I was pa&s;&s;ing him by, he caught hold of my hand,
<PB N="160" REF="169">
and a&s;&s;ured me, that, that tall gentleman in black, who was &s;tanding at &s;uch a door, was one of the worthie&s;t fellows in the kingdom; for &s;ays Ralph, <Q>there is not a day he ri&s;es, but what he is ma&s;ter of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds.</Q></P>
<P>IN a few minutes Ralph and his friend pa&s;&s;ed me by, and the odd mortal was acquie&s;cing to every thing he &s;aid, with &s;uch a humility of re&s;|pect, that I thought it was wholly improbable he &s;hould find any fre&s;h opportunity of &s;hifting his company; notwith&s;tanding the plau&s;ibility of ap|pearances, however, in le&s;s than five minutes, he was in full chace after a chariot that drove through St. Paul's Church-yard with the greate&s;t rapidity, and was &s;aid to belong to a Jewi&s;h merchant, of the fir&s;t eminence, well known at that time for his intimate connexion with Sir Robert Walpole.</P>
<P>IF the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large fortune could be&s;tow either worth or good &s;en&s;e, I &s;hould never be &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee the rich treated with the utmo&s;t re&s;|pect; or had people even but a di&s;tant expectation of gaining any advantage from the opulence of their pur&s;e-proud acquaintance, &s;omething might be &s;aid in their defence; but where without a &s;hadow of merit, or a hope of his conferring a favour, a man is next to be idolized, merely <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he is ma&s;ter of ten or twenty thou&s;and pounds, I own I cannot help being hurt at the little-mind|edne&s;s of his wor&s;hippers, and mu&s;t inevitably tax
<PB N="161" REF="170">
them with a palpable poverty of &s;pirit, if not a total want of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IN the di&s;&s;olute reign of Charles the &s;econd, the celebrated Killigrew was one night at &s;upper with the Duke of Buckingham, Lord Dor&s;et, Lord Roche&s;ter, and &s;ome other noblemen of the mo&s;t eminent abilities; the latter, by &s;ome means, hap|pened to turn the conver&s;ation on the great honour which Killigrew received, from the dignity of his company. The wag, who, notwith&s;tanding the in|feriority of his rank, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more real &s;en&s;e than the whole groupe put together, took all in good part for &s;ome time; till, at la&s;t, finding matters grow a little &s;erious, he &s;tood up and delivered him&s;elf to the following effect. <Q>And, pray my lord, whence proceeds all this mighty honour which I am thought to receive? From your dig|nity, I &s;uppo&s;e, and your fortune? As to the fir&s;t you find, by &s;ad experience, that where there is a want of worth, this gew-gaw of title won't keep a man from contempt; a fool, or a ra&s;cal, is equally a fool and a ra&s;cal, whether he is a plain Killigrew, or a great earl of Roche&s;ter: as to the &s;econd point, your fortune; when you make me the better for it, why then it will teach me to e&s;teem you, till then don't mention it as a matter of the lea&s;t importance to me; for as long as I pay my reckoning, and receive no obliga|tions, in regard to circum&s;tances, I am company for a Cre&s;us, and would not &s;uffer an emperor to treat me with the &s;hadow of a di&s;re&s;pect within the walls of a tavern.</Q></P>

<P>I HAVE often delivered it as my opinion, that one of the principal indi&s;cretions which any woman can po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of, is to receive the addre&s;&s;es of a lover, whom &s;he does not mean to en|courage. If he happens to be a worthy man, it is ungenerous as well as cruel to keep him in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and he is too poor a &s;acrifice even for her vanity, if he happens to be a fool; but if a ju&s;t con&s;idera|tion for the lover does not more commonly excite an exalted &s;hare of benevolence in the female bo|&s;om, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that the ladies are not more generally actuated by a &s;en&s;ible regard for them|&s;elves, &s;ince this indi&s;criminate permi&s;&s;ion which they grant to the addre&s;&s;es of an indifferent admirer, may very fatally injure them with the real object of their e&s;teem; and give the man who has indeed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hearts, but too much rea&s;on for imagining that the &s;ame vanity might induce them <HI>after</HI> marriage to encourage that fa&s;cinating voice of admiration, which was found &s;o exqui|&s;itely ravi&s;hing to their ears <HI>before.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a mighty plea&s;ant notion which prevails among the greate&s;t number of our young ladies, that there is a &s;ort of de&s;tiny in love; and that it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the orders of their fate in the di&s;po&s;ition of their hearts. Perhaps neither the army nor the play-hou&s;e has de&s;troyed the quiet of &s;o many bo&s;oms as the belief of this
<PB N="163" REF="172">
delightful prede&s;tination; for a girl now-a-days, no &s;ooner has a hankering after a fellow, but &s;he imagines the &s;tars have been at work about her, and looks upon it as obeying the will of heaven to follow &mdash; the bent of her own inclinations.</P>
<P>ONE thing inded very remarkable in the de|ci&s;ion of the &s;tars, is, that it never lays any dis|agreeable re&s;traints upon the mind of a young woman; on the contrary, with an unparallelled degree of good-nature, the &s;tars always give tho&s;e orders which are mo&s;t certain of meeting with her own approbation, and are as tender of her repo&s;e and &s;atisfaction, as &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly be her&s;elf. This exce&s;&s;ive complai&s;ance in the &s;tars furni&s;hes the de&s;igning and illiberal part of our &s;ex with many op|portunities of gaining the mo&s;t mercenary or mo&s;t infamous ends; it enables us to rob a woman not only of all filial affection, but to &s;trip her of her fortune and her honour, and puts it in our power not only to de&s;troy all her happine&s;s in this world, but to endanger her everla&s;ting felicity too.</P>
<P>THAT my fair readers may know with cer|tainty, at what time the &s;tars begin to influence their conduct, I &s;hall &s;et down &s;ome infallible rules which will &s;erve them upon all occa&s;ions, and which, if rightly attended to, may po&s;&s;ibly prevent a thou&s;and inconveniencies to many indi|viduals, and a thou&s;and anxieties to many families.</P>
<P>FIRST then &mdash; Whenever a young woman be|gins to make &s;ecret appointments with a man, for the mere &s;ake of chatting with him, and taking an
<PB N="164" REF="173">
agreeable walk, &s;he may be pretty confident that the &s;tars are then debating about the future di&s;po|&s;ition of her life, and that &s;he is in a fair way of lo&s;ing her reputation.</P>
<P>SECONDLY &mdash; Whenever &s;he receives a letter upon the &s;ubject of love, and declines either pe|remptorily to forbid the addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ender, or to di&s;clo&s;e the affair to her friends, &s;he may be &s;atisfied that her &s;tars are very deceitful, and that they are only tempting her to wretchedne&s;s and di&s;grace. The rea&s;on is obvious. A lover has no occa&s;ion to be concealed, who would make an un|exceptionable hu&s;band; and few ever require the &s;ecrecy of a mi&s;tre&s;s on this head, but tho&s;e who have a de&s;ign again&s;t her honour or her fortune.</P>
<P>THIRDLY &mdash; Whenever &s;he is unea&s;y about the ab&s;ence of any particular man, nettled at &s;eeing him with any other woman, or angry at hearing any part of his conduct condemned; the &s;ymptoms &s;trongly indicate that the &s;tars are going to deprive her of her heart; and it behoves her to be un|commonly attentive to the principles, and merit of the per&s;on for whom &s;he feels this partiality.</P>
<P>AND fourthly &mdash; But if in&s;tead of real worth, and fine under&s;tanding, the object of this partiality &s;hould be fa&s;hionable only by his vices, and eminent only for his knowledge in the &s;uperficials of behaviour, let her then if &s;he would counteract the malignity of her de&s;tiny, and &s;oar &s;uperior to the &s;tars them|&s;elves; let her exert her rea&s;on to tear the grow|ing tenderne&s;s from her heart; and above every
<PB N="165" REF="174">
thing, if her favourite has once in his life betrayed the confidence of any other woman, let her bani&s;h him in&s;tantly from her &s;ight, and recollect, that a man who has once violated the vows of love, is too de&s;picable ever to be loved at all.</P>

<P>IT is really &s;urpri&s;ing, when we con&s;ider that the people of the pre&s;ent age have ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te, &s;mell, and feeling, and ju&s;t the &s;ame faculties of hearing and &s;ight as their ance&s;tors po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, that there &s;hould be &s;o wide a di&s;parity in their manners, as almo&s;t to furni&s;h a &s;uppo&s;ition that we are quite a different &s;pecies, and have no|thing in our compo&s;itions that can indicate our de&s;cent, but the mere form of our progenitors.</P>
<P>TO be &s;ure it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that our deviation from &s;ome manners of former ages, was a very &s;en&s;ible proceeding, as many of the antient cu&s;toms were infinitely too barbarous to be kept up among a people who every day made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s in all the delicacies of breeding which con&s;titute the &s;tandard of real gentility.

Hence we &s;often the mo&s;t palpable ava|rice into di&s;cretion and oeconomy; di&s;hone&s;ty pa&s;|&s;es for wildne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation; bla&s;phemy for humour and wit; and ab&s;olute murder, for &s;pirit and vivacity. In &s;hort, we are &s;o extremely well bred, that there is not a vice but what we keep in countenance by our politene&s;s, nor a folly which we do not &s;upport from a principle of civility.</P>
<P>THE refinement of the pre&s;ent age does not, however, content it&s;elf with making people happy in their own opinions, but it recommends them al&s;o to the re&s;pect of the world, and rai&s;es the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable characters to an in&s;tant degree of dignity; now-a-days it would be unpardonably vulgar to call a milk-woman by any other appel|lation than that of a lady; and the meane&s;t arti&s;an within the weekly-bills, if he happens to want an apprentice, will publicly adverti&s;e for a <HI>young gentleman.</HI> A bit of lace upon a wai&s;tcoat, makes a &s;quire of a fellow who has not &s;ixpence in the world; and a paltry little en&s;igncy is as &s;ure of conferring the formidable word <HI>captain,</HI> as if the owner had actually given a thou&s;and guineas for a company. As to the more elevated titles of
<PB N="167" REF="176">
knight, lord, marquis and duke, they are &s;o no|toriou&s;ly kept &s;acred for men of real integrity and virtue, that complai&s;ance never has it in her power to degrade them by any ca&s;ual pro&s;titution to the unde&s;erving; the&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t be exempted from the &s;everity of animadver&s;ion, and &s;uppo&s;ed to continue in the &s;ame pri&s;tine &s;tate of purity as when they were originally conferred upon our ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>BUT of all the deviations which we have made from the cu&s;toms of antiquity, I know of none which does a greater honour to our politene&s;s, than the judicious di&s;regard which at this &s;ea&s;on of the year we &s;hew to a ridiculous fe&s;tival, that u&s;ed to be formerly celebrated with &s;o much &s;olemnity by our progenitors: as the name of this fe&s;tival may po&s;&s;ibly be forgotten among people of extraordinary elegance, it may not be ami&s;s perhaps to ob&s;erve, that it was called CHRISTMAS, and was held as an annual commemoration of the Deity's won|derful goodne&s;s in &s;ending his only Son to take upon him the form of human nature, and to make an awful attonement for the &s;ins of mankind. Among our forefathers this anniver&s;ary was con|&s;tantly con&s;idered as a te&s;t both of their principles as Chri&s;tians, and their benevolence as men: an event which brought no le&s;s than everla&s;ting hap|pine&s;s to all the world, they thought it improper to pa&s;s without marks of particular joy; and were ambitious to imitate the benignity of their creator as far as their abilities would reach, by exerci&s;ing
<PB N="168" REF="177">
every act of benevolence between them&s;elves. Hence at the return of Chri&s;tmas the &s;ighing heart naturally expected a mitigation of its &s;orrows; and it was reckoned nothing more than a duty to wipe away the tear of affliction from the eye of di&s;tre&s;s. After the offices of charity were thus performed, nothing prevailed but a univer&s;al fe&s;tivity; and every face was either dilated with the emotions of gratitude, or expanded with the more tumultous &s;en&s;ations of joy; a continual intercour&s;e of the mo&s;t friendly nature &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between family and family; and in &s;hort, the acknowledgements which were made for the mercy of the divine being, participating in &s;ome degree of a divine fervour, <HI>all</HI> (to u&s;e the poet's definition of paradi&s;e) <HI>was harmony and love,</HI></P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent age, as we are much too polite to entertain any notions of religion, &s;o we are much too &s;en&s;ible to &s;hew any &s;olicitude about the day in which the almighty founder of what was once a belief in this country, came into the world. In&s;tead, therefore, of &s;ending at this period to re|lieve the &s;ons and daughters of calamity, we fly where it is impo&s;&s;ible for their lamentations to reach us; and in&s;tead of maintaining a &s;ocial in|tercour&s;e with our neighbours, we lock our&s;elves up, and give an unlimited &s;cope to the gloomine&s;s of our own reflexions. Indeed a mo&s;t perfect in|timacy of cards all this time goes on between us and our acquaintance; we vi&s;it one another in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner by me&s;&s;age and compli|ment;
<PB N="169" REF="178">
and are the deare&s;t friends on earth, through the negotiation of a couple of fellows in livery.</P>
<P>IF po&s;terity &s;hould happen to differ as widely from us, as we have differed from our forefathers, I &s;uppo&s;e in the cour&s;e of a century or two, it will be looked upon as inelegant, to know that &s;uch a fe&s;tival as Chri&s;tmas ever exi&s;ted, and thought prepo&s;terou&s;ly gothic for a man to be acquainted with the names of his own family. Politene&s;&s; may render it nece&s;&s;ary perhaps to make a total revo|lution in the affairs of the world; and as now we are all ambitious of being reckoned men of &s;en&s;e, it may then be the mode to appear in the real character of the pre&s;ent times, and the unver&s;al wi&s;h of every man, like hone&s;t Dogberry, to be &s;et down a fool.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was an excellent ob&s;ervation of the celebra|ted Rochfoucault, that vice and virtue were never judged of in proportion to the real deformity of the one, or the native excellence of the other, but only in proportion to the re&s;pective rank of tho&s;e with whom either were to be found; the dif|ference of &s;tations always aggravating the enormity of the fir&s;t, or derogating from the beauty of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="179">THAT there is but too much foundation for the remark of this illu&s;trious writer, no man acquaint|ed in ever &s;o &s;mall a degree with the world, can take upon him to di&s;pute; the &s;ame action, which in a trade&s;man would be mentioned as a matter of no merit, in a nobleman would be &s;poke of with the highe&s;t admiration. My worthy friends upon the change, &s;eldom think there is any great com|pliment due to a mechanic for being punctual in di&s;charging what he owes; but let me a&s;k, if they do not talk in raptures of a nobleman, at the court end of the town, if he happens to be un|fa&s;hionably remarkable in paying his debts. If a trade&s;man &s;educes an unhappy innocent from the paths of virtue, the crime is heightened in the blacke&s;t dyes; but let a man of fa&s;hion be guilty of the very &s;ame action, and it &s;inks under the &s;oftening appellation of modi&s;h indi&s;cretion or illiberal vivacity. If a general behaves gal|lantly in the field of battle, his reputation is im|mortal; but let a private centinel perform the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing prodigies of valour, the ob&s;curity of his &s;ituation ca&s;ts a veil over his merit, we mention him perhaps a &s;econd time, and then con&s;ign him to oblivion ever after.</P>
<P>IF a proper examination was to be made into the ca&s;e, this partiality on the &s;ide of rank, would appear no le&s;s ridiculous than unju&s;t; for people, in the more elevated &s;tations of life, receiving an education that ought to teach them the nicer pro|prieties of behaviour in a manner &s;uperior to the
<PB N="171" REF="180">
ordinary cla&s;&s;es of mankind, are con&s;equently bound to a &s;tricter ob&s;ervance of their duty than tho&s;e by whom they are not &s;o perfectly under&s;tood. Yet &s;uch we &s;ee is the depravity of the age, that tho&s;e claim the wide&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation from their moral obligations, who ought to be be&s;t acquainted with the nece&s;&s;ity of their being di&s;charged; and tho&s;e only are rendered inexcu&s;able, who, from their education and rank in life, are neither &s;o con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;o happy in the means.</P>
<P>WAS a poor ignorant foot-boy to bla&s;pheme his Maker, the crime would be con&s;idered in it's pro|per colours; but &s;hould his ma&s;ter take the &s;ame liberty with the divine Being, it would be reckoned no more than a lively &s;troke of wit, or the ca&s;ual re&s;ult of a &s;prightly imagination. We have lately &s;een a poor man publicly puni&s;hed for &s;peaking too freely of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s legation; while a Bolingbroke has been held in general admiration, though he denied the diviner mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Happy how|ever is it for the meaner orders of people, that they are bound to a rectitude of behaviour from which their &s;uperiors think them&s;elves exempted by the indulgence of the laws; as the whole&s;ome re&s;tric|tion which they live under in this world, will be of infinite advantage to their &s;ituation in the next.</P>
<P>BUT to condemn the pre&s;ent aera only, for this glaring partiality to rank, would be inju&s;tice to our&s;elves. &mdash; The hi&s;tory of all ages, and the annals of all nations, are fraught with examples where the vices of the low are dre&s;&s;ed up in the mo&s;t ag|gravating
<PB N="172" REF="181">
light, and their virtues as con&s;tantly &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. &mdash; Patriots and poets, heroes and philo&s;o|phers, owe as much to their rank as to their abili|ties; unle&s;s they lived at particular periods where they were uncommonly rare, or had indeed an uncommon &s;hare of abilities to recommend them. Had not Ovid been a man of fa&s;hion, his wri|tings would not have outlived him&s;elf, not|with&s;tanding his egregious vanity; but his rank &s;tamped a &s;ort of merit upon him in his days, and hence they are looked upon with admiration in ours; nor would the immortal Marcus Brutus have ever been handed down with reverence to po&s;terity, had he, like the unhappy Mr. Felton, been only an ob&s;cure lieutenant of foot.</P>
<P>AS I have touched upon patrioti&s;m, I &s;hall beg leave to conclude my paper with as great an in|&s;tance of patrioti&s;m as hi&s;tory can po&s;&s;ibly pro|duce, though the patriot was no more than an ig|norant malefactor, who &s;uffered for a highway rob|bery when the nece&s;&s;ity of the times had left his family without bread.</P>
<P>THE third of June, 1734, one Michael Car|mody, a journeyman Weaver, was executed in the county of Cork, in Ireland. His branch of bu|&s;ine&s;s had been long in a very declining way, owing to the wearing of cottons, which was highly de&s;tructive to the woollen manufactory, and in ge|neral injurious to the kingdom. &mdash; The criminal was dre&s;&s;ed in cotton, and not only the hangman, but the gallows was decorated in cotton too.
<PB N="173" REF="182">
When Carmody was brought to the place of exe|cution, his whole thoughts were turned upon the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his country, and, in&s;tead of making u&s;e of his la&s;t moments with the prie&s;t, the poor fellow addre&s;&s;ed the &s;urrounding multitude in the following extraordinary oration:</P>
<P><Q>GIVE ear, O good people, to the words of a dying &s;inner; I confe&s;s I have been guilty of many crimes that nece&s;&s;ity obliged me to commit, which &s;tarving condition I was in, I am well a&s;&s;ured was occa&s;ioned by the &s;carcity of money that has proceeded from the great di&s;couragement of our woollen manufactures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEREFORE, good chri&s;tians, con&s;ider that if you go on to &s;uppre&s;s your own goods by wearing &s;uch cottons as I am now cloathed in, you will bring your country into mi&s;ery, which will con|&s;equently &s;warm with &s;uch unhappy malefactors as your pre&s;ent object is, and the blood of every mi&s;erable felon that will hang, (after this warn|ing from the gallows) will lie at your doors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AND if you have any regard for the prayers of an expiring mortal, I beg you will not buy of the hangman the cotton garments that now adorn the gallows, becau&s;e I can't re&s;t quiet in my grave if I <HI>&s;hould &s;ee</HI> the very things worn that brought me to mi&s;ery, thievery, and this un|timely end; all which I pray of the gentry to hinder their children and &s;ervants, for their own characters &s;ake, though they have no tenderne&s;s for their country, becau&s;e none will hereafter
<PB N="174" REF="183">
wear cottons, but oy&s;terwomen, criminals, whores, huck&s;ters, and common hangmen.</Q></P>
<P>I SUBMIT to the reader of judgment, if &s;enti|ments of a more patriotic nature could heave from the bo&s;om of a Sidney or a Ru&s;&s;el, than what breathed in the coar&s;e un&s;tudied harangue of this unfortunate malefactor. At the very hour of death, in the immediate apprehen&s;ion of an eternity, dre&s;t up in all the horrors of popi&s;h bigotry and &s;uper|&s;tition: I &s;ay, at &s;uch an hour, an ignorant, poor wretch, to be only mindful of his country's welfare, is a greatne&s;s of &s;oul &s;uperior to the mo&s;t celebrated &s;toic of antiquity, and throws even the <HI>Cato of Utica</HI> in a &s;cale of comparative cowardice, was there a po&s;&s;ibility of a parallel.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not been more plea&s;ed a long time, than at reading one of your late papers relative to the general ab&s;urdity of toa&s;ting; you have very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that in proportion as any kingdom is inclined to drinking it is barbarous of cour&s;e, and have, with the greate&s;t rea&s;on imagi|nable, e&s;timated the under&s;tanding of every people by the criterion of &s;obriety.</P>
<P>MY motive for taking &s;o particular a notice of that paper Mr. Babler, is my being married to as worthy a little man as any within the weekly bills, who has one unhappy propen&s;ity, and that is an invincible attachment to the gla&s;s; &mdash; At a very early period he was introduced into life, and com|menced an acquaintance with a &s;et of &s;ubaltern worthies, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>damn'd hone&s;t fellows,</HI> and always placed the &s;ummit of human felicity in the midnight roar of a tavern.</P>
<P>HAVING through &s;ome unaccountable infatua|tions imbibed an extraordinary opinion of this hopeful cla&s;s of gentlemen, he always regulated his conduct, not by what the con&s;iderate part of mankind was likely to think of his behaviour,
<PB N="176" REF="185">
but by what it was probable the little circle at the Black Swan would be inclined to imagine at the next meeting; hence there was &s;carce an ab&s;urdity into which he did not launch with an exqui&s;ite re|li&s;h, nor an irregularity which he did not look upon as a mark of &s;uperior under&s;tanding; he got upon the table to &s;ing <Q>When forc'd from dear Hebe to go,</Q> and burned his wig out of honour to the royal family; every battle which our armies gained abroad was &s;ure to keep him in a con&s;tant &s;tate of intoxication for a fortnight, till by in|ce&s;&s;antly pledging the health of our various gallant commanders he had almo&s;t intirely exhau&s;ted his own.</P>
<P>BY this time his friends thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould look out for a wife and take up; by means of an old family connection, I was the fir&s;t per&s;on propo&s;ed to him; his rela|tions &s;poke to mine, &s;ettled the affair, and we were married in about three months: for near &s;ix weeks there was not a more dome&s;tic man in the uni|ver&s;e; he &s;upped regularly at home, drank a chear|ful pint or played a game at cards with two or three orderly friends in the neighbourhood; but un|luckily this mode of living was two unexceptiona|able to la&s;t for any continuance; a favourite com|panion of his came accidentally to town, took him out one evening to the Black Swan and rekindled that rage for underbred fe&s;tivity, which originally led him into &s;uch a perpetual round of exce&s;s; he now went out every night, and &s;eldom returned
<PB N="177" REF="186">
till two or three in the morning; my fears for him kept me continually up till he came home, and then I had the plea&s;ure of receiving him in &s;uch a pickle as is much more ea&s;y for a gentleman to imagine than it is either po&s;&s;ible or proper for me to de&s;cribe: &s;uffice it, however, that he was in|toxicated every night, and every day underwent a mo&s;t &s;evere indipo&s;ition, to recruit him&s;elf for the fatigues of the next evening.</P>
<P>THIS has been the ca&s;e, Mr. Babler, for almo&s;t five years, and you can &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e how mi|&s;erable I have con&s;tantly been from his ridiculous mode of proceeding; yet, Sir, though I flatter my|&s;elf that I am capable of advi&s;ing him pretty much for his benefit, I have never pre&s;umed to &s;ay a &s;in|gle &s;yllable; let the admonitions of a wife be ne|ver &s;o tender or re&s;pectful, they are always looked upon as &s;o many indirect commands; and a hu&s;|band is immediately &s;et down among the hen|pecked fraternity, if he pays the lea&s;t attention to her advice, however nece&s;&s;ary for the intere&s;t of his fortune or the credit of his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I AM forcibly led, Mr. Babler, into a commu|nication of family-affairs, becau&s;e I do not choo&s;e to lay the folly of my hu&s;band's behaviour imme|diately before him&s;elf, and have no friend what|&s;oever on whom I could rely for the proper execu|tion of &s;o difficult a ta&s;k; every body &s;uppo&s;es, be|cau&s;e I have the key of the ca&s;h, and am never checked for laying out what money I think proper, that I mu&s;t be a very happy woman: but, ala&s;s,
<PB N="178" REF="187">
Mr. Babler, the ca&s;e is widely different, my hu&s;|band has to be &s;ure a thou&s;and good qualities; but do the&s;e qualities &s;ecure him from broils in the hour of intoxication; or prevent him from being contemptible in the interval of exce&s;s? About a week ago he came home to me with his eye almo&s;t cut out, by a drinking-gla&s;s, which was thrown at him for refu&s;ing a particular toa&s;t; and no later than la&s;t night, he was brought to the door in a coffin, upon the &s;houlders of four companions, who, by way of dirge, &s;ung the roa&s;t beef of Old England as they carried him, while the helple&s;s poor creature at the end of every &s;tanza endeavour|ed to rai&s;e him&s;elf up, and chorus with, <Q>O the rare Engli&s;h roa&s;t beef.</Q></P>
<P>MY hu&s;band's health every day decaying, through the&s;e irregularities, and his character like|wi&s;e &s;inking into contempt; I beg, Mr. Babler, you will tell him that the name of <HI>an hone&s;t fellow,</HI> or the applau&s;e of a noi&s;y room is but a poor com|pen&s;ation for the &s;acrifice of his life, and the ruin of his family; tell him, Sir, that his companions are people who cannot po&s;&s;ibly have the lea&s;t regard for him, becau&s;e they are dead to every con&s;idera|tion for them&s;elves &mdash; a rational entertainment they are utterly unable to enjoy, becau&s;e they are never happy till rea&s;on is totally de&s;troyed; tell him, Mr. Babler, in &s;hort, that life is a matter of much importance, and &s;hould never be laughed away for the applau&s;es of a fool: next to being a block|head him&s;elf, the greate&s;t impeachment of his un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="179" REF="188">
is to a&s;&s;ociate with block-heads; and next to being a profligate him&s;elf, the greate&s;t re|flexion upon his heart is to throw away his time upon men of profe&s;&s;ed irreligion and immorality.</P>

<P>THE high and mighty lords of the creation are for ever valuing them&s;elves upon the &s;u|perior dignity of their &s;ex, and not only deny the poor women any thing like an equal &s;hare of un|der&s;tanding with them&s;elves, but even refu&s;e to ratify their claim to an equal degree of principle; as if it was not &s;ufficient to entertain a contemp|tible idea of their intellects, without e&s;tabli&s;hing as mean an opinion of their hearts. Hence has the notion of female friend&s;hip particularly, been an object of con&s;tant ridicule to every fa&s;hionable writer; hence have we been a thou&s;and times a&s;&s;ured, that a laced cap, or an elegant pair of ruffles, was a matter con&s;equential enough to break the &s;tronge&s;t bonds of e&s;teem that ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between two of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible women in the univer&s;e; and hence it has been a&s;&s;erted, that there is no po&s;&s;ibilily for their intercour&s;e to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t a &s;ingle moment after each of them had en|tertained a favourable &s;entiment about the &s;ame man.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="189">WITHOUT once &s;triving to refute any of the&s;e po&s;itions, I &s;hall only lament that the gentlemen have not endeavoured to give &s;ome te&s;timonies in &s;upport of their own conduct, before they at|tempted in this good-natured manner to ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone; becau&s;e it is rather unfortunate that the charge &s;o &s;trongly urged again&s;t the ladies, &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, exi&s;t with infinitely more ju&s;tice again&s;t them&s;elves: let us, however, for argu|ment, &s;uppo&s;e, that the friend&s;hip of two women, extremely worthy in every other re&s;pect, is capable of being entirely broken, by the minute&s;t circum|&s;tance which we can po&s;&s;ibly conceive; &s;till, will not a moment's examination of the other &s;ex con|vince us, that their boa&s;ted friend&s;hips are equally liable to the &s;tronge&s;t interruptions from cau&s;es equally trivial; and that men of the be&s;t under|&s;tanding frequently run into the mo&s;t dangerous exce&s;&s;es, from circum&s;tances generally more de&s;|picable, and always as ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>I READILY grant that it is very ridiculous in a woman to break off all manner of connexion with an intimate acquaintance, merely becau&s;e this ac|quaintance may unfortunately happen to be better dre&s;&s;ed; but is it not to the full as ridiculous for a couple of fellows, who perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t exalted under&s;tandings, and are be&s;ides in all pro|bability, entru&s;ted with a part of the national wel|fare, to fall out about the niceties of a hor&s;e-match, or to di&s;agree about the &s;uperior excellence of a game cock? Undoubtedly yes; and though I
<PB N="181" REF="190">
&s;hall not even pretend to exculpate the ladies where they chance to be rivals, and &s;uffer their re&s;ent|ment to tran&s;port them beyond the bounds of di&s;|cretion; &s;till I think it much more excu&s;able when they have a little &s;cene of altercation about a worthy man, than when the lords of the creation proceed to cut one another's throats about &s;ome infamous &s;trumpet whom they both look upon with an equal degree of contempt.</P>
<P>THIS being the ca&s;e then; in the name of won|der whence comes it that the poor women are eternally condemned for the in&s;tability of their friend&s;hips, when this very in&s;tability is carried to exce&s;&s;es infinitely more criminal as well as ridicu|lous among our&s;elves? Are the lords of the human kind, with all the mighty &s;uperiority of their wi&s;|dom, to be continually indulged in the commi&s;&s;ion of errors, of which the meane&s;t driveller among the ignorant wretches of the other &s;ex would be to the la&s;t degree a&s;hamed? Alas! the ladies may cry out with the lion in the fable, it is well that the men are the only painters on this occa&s;ion, or the tables would be in&s;tantly rever&s;ed!</P>
<P>WE may blame the caprices of the women as we plea&s;e, and cen&s;ure their ab&s;urdities as we think proper; but our partiality will never be able to change the po&s;itive nature of things: few of their follies are ever more than ridiculous; few of our own are ever le&s;s than criminal; how heartily do we laugh, when a couple of ignorant girls, as we call them, have the lea&s;t di&s;agreement and break

out into altercation; yet, which of our&s;elves would not imagine he was bound in honour to re&s;ent the mo&s;t unguarded expre&s;&s;ion of vehemence in a friend, even at the hazard of his life in this world, and the ri&s;que of his eternal happine&s;s in the next?</P>
<P>THE quarrels of the women, as they are ge|nerally le&s;s ab&s;urd in their beginnings, &s;o their re|&s;entments are generally more &s;en&s;ible too: Where a lady has received an offence, &s;he &s;eldom does any thing more than withdraw her acquaintance, and treat the per&s;on who offers it with a proper degree of contempt. The regard &s;he entertains for the dignity of her &s;ex, renders it unpardonable to go further: but the lord of the creation is, by the &s;u|perior degree of his &s;pecies, allowed a right of plunging into the deadlie&s;t crimes; and by his ex|alted under&s;tanding, a privilege of committing the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities: if he happens to meet with a &s;light injury, he in&s;i&s;ts upon giving his enemy an opportunity of doing him an irreparable one; and mu&s;t wa&s;h away the imaginary di&s;honour, either with the blood of his antagoni&s;t or his own. To be &s;ure, it is rather hard to take away the life of a friend for a ca&s;ual vehemence of temper; and ra|ther &s;trange to reduce one's &s;elf to a level with a per&s;on from whom we have received an offence. But what of that; the glorious incon&s;i&s;tency of manhood obliges us to act in contradiction to our rea&s;on; and the fear of a laugh from a blockhead, is infinitely more terrible than the vengeance of our God! We all of us, in &s;hort, are ready to run a

man through the body, who calls us either a &s;coun|drel or a fool; though the invariable tenor of our conduct indicates the &s;tronge&s;t ambition for both of the&s;e re&s;pectable characters; and we are infinite|ly more offended at being <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> either a ra&s;cal or an idiot, than at being <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> the very thing it&s;elf.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read Mr. John&s;on's celebrated preface to Shake&s;pear with much attention, and though I look upon it on the whole as a very ma&s;terly piece of writing, yet I think in &s;ome places he has dealt rather uncandidly with his author; and in others argued not a little repugnant to rea&s;on, in his defence.</P>
<P>MR. JOHNSON in the fir&s;t place gives Shake&s;pear very little credit for his tragedies, and calls them, in more places than one, rather the con&s;equence of labour than the effect of genius. There is to be &s;ure great deference due to the opinion of &s;o learned a commentator; but yet with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect to Mr. John&s;on, the opinion which he here pro|nounces is nothing more than bare a&s;&s;ertion, and con&s;equently cannot be admitted as ab&s;olute proof; for my own part I know &s;everal gentlemen of the
<PB N="184" REF="193">
fir&s;t abilities, who declare, that Shake&s;pear's trage|dies are replete with &s;uch beauties as every di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate reader mu&s;t allow to be the &s;pontaneous re|&s;ult of the mo&s;t exalted imagination; in fact, it is the genuine force of genius, which admid&s;t &s;uch a heap of ab&s;urdities, renders his tragedies &s;o uni|ver&s;ally admired; and gives them &s;o prodigious a &s;uperiority over all the other poets that ever ap|peared in this country.</P>
<P>IN a que&s;tion of this kind the feelings of a man's own heart are infinitely better judges than the mo&s;t elaborate arguments of the fir&s;t &s;cholar in the king|dom; we may be frequently lo&s;t in the mazes of erudition, and be led into a thou&s;and perplexities in the immediate pur&s;uit of per&s;picuity; but the feelings never can draw us into any mi&s;take; when the voice of nature calls at our bo&s;oms we may be certain that genius is not very far off, however &s;he may appear clogged with an uncouth heavine&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, or a total di&s;regard of the unities.</P>
<P>INDEED, if Mr. John&s;on means that the ver|&s;ification, nece&s;&s;ary for tragic poetry, mu&s;t be more laboured than the familiar &s;tile of comedy, where every man conver&s;es as if he was in common com|pany, &mdash; his ob&s;ervation may have &s;ome weight&mdash; but &s;till it will be no impeachment of Shake&s;pear's genius for tragedy: every body knows that ver&s;e requires more attention than pro&s;e; and nobody is a better judge of this truth than Mr. John&s;on. All therefore, that the remark can prove upon the whole is, that Shake&s;pear being more confined to
<PB N="185" REF="194">
ver&s;e in his tragic than in his comic compo&s;itions, who nece&s;&s;arily employed a greater portion of time in writting the former than the latter; and might con&s;equently, in a comparative &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to la|bour at his tragedies. That this is the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, whoever has read him, with any degree of care, will readily confe&s;s; for wherever he has in|troduced ver&s;e into his comedies, we find ju&s;t the &s;ame toil after the nicety of expre&s;&s;ion, as we &s;ee he has u&s;ed in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful of his oppo&s;ite performances.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t undoubtedly be allowed, that in all the ver&s;ification of Shake&s;pear, there is a &s;tiffne&s;s which frequently appears di&s;agreeably uncouth or ridicu|lou&s;ly affected: but when we con&s;ider at how early a period this great man wrote, in&s;tead of being &s;urpri&s;ed that we meet it &s;o often, we ought to be a&s;toni&s;hed at not meeting it oftener &s;till. Our language was then almo&s;t in it's infancy, and ver&s;e wanted the hand of experience to poli&s;h it into harmony and grace. Exalted therefore, as the ge|nius of Shake&s;pear was, he could not work mi|racles, nor take upon him to give that mellifluence to numbers which was only to be obtained from the ripening tenderne&s;s of time.</P>
<P>MR. JOHNSON having urged this objection again&s;t the tragedy of Shake&s;pear, he tells us, that in comedy this great man was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of a quibble, and in order to ring the changes of a de&s;picable wittici&s;m upon a word, he would fre|quently &s;acrifice both ju&s;tne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion and na|tural
<PB N="186" REF="195">
propriety. To be &s;ure I mu&s;t acknowledge that Shake&s;pear was rather too much addicted to this error; but Mr. John&s;on, while he indulged the &s;everity of the critic, ought to have maintained the candour of the commentator; he &s;hould have con&s;idered that this mode of quibbling was the literary vice of the time, and that con&s;equently the whole era was more to be cen&s;ured than any in|dividual who gave into the ab&s;urdity. Every age has &s;ome certain &s;pecies of wit to di&s;tingui&s;h it; and this wit, the able&s;t authors mu&s;t &s;ometimes &s;tudy with attention, but none more particularly than tho&s;e who write for the theatre; a popular joke has more than once turned the fortune of a piece; and in the early periods of the drama, before the ta&s;te of the people was tollerably e&s;tabli&s;hed, it might be nece&s;&s;ary to countenance a general foible for the &s;ake of &s;ecuring a general approbation. A dramatic writer, unlike all others, has his fate frequently depending on the whim&s;ey of an au|dience; and therefore it is &s;ometimes dangerous to combat with received prejudices. If a conjecture might be hazarded, I &s;hould imagine that this was Shake&s;pear's opinion; for after he had fully fixed his character with the world, we find him in &s;everal of his pieces finding fault with the quibbling pro|pen&s;ity of the times, and telling us that,
<Q>Every fool can play upon a word.</Q></P>
<P>ON the&s;e accounts I &s;hould imagine that where Shake&s;pear conde&s;cends to &s;port upon words he has a great deal to be &s;aid in his extenuation;
<PB N="187" REF="196">
and therefore I cannot agree with Mr. John&s;on, that a quibble was the Cleopatra for which he was content to &s;acrifice the world; &s;ince had he made that the &s;ole object of his admiration, he would have lo&s;t that world in a very little time in&s;tead of keeping it, as he has done for near a couple of centuries, without any thing like the &s;hadow of a competitor.</P>
<P>HAVING thus animadverted upon Mr. John&s;on's capital objections to Shake&s;pear, I &s;hall make one ob&s;ervation upon his defence of that illu&s;trious writer, with re&s;pect to the general di&s;regard of unity, which appears in his productions. The unities, or the con&s;i&s;tency of times and place, Mr. John&s;on, &s;eems to think as matters of no great importance in dramatic repre&s;entations. It is impo&s;&s;ible, argues this learned commentator, for any &s;pectator to &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;tage and a few &s;cenes are in fact either Athens or Rome; and it is al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible for an auditor to imagine a Timon or a Cae&s;ar can now be actually pre&s;ented to our view, who have been dead &s;uch a number of cen|turies; of con&s;equence, infers Mr. John&s;on, the pre&s;ervation of time or a place can be no way e&s;&s;ential, &s;ince every body is &s;en&s;ible that the whole repre&s;entation is nothing more than an agreeable &s;tory, calculated entirely for the amu&s;ement of the public.</P>
<P>WITH great difference, however, to Mr. John|&s;on's &s;entiments, I mu&s;t remind him that the prin|cipal plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from any play, ari&s;es
<PB N="188" REF="197">
from a &s;uppo&s;ition of its being a reality. We all know that we &s;it to &s;ee a &s;et of people paid for the publc entertainment; yet we al&s;o know that unle&s;s we in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;e every idea of their real per&s;ons and employments, we imagine either that they perform extremely ill, or that the play is a very in&s;ipid production. If then in the appearance of the actors we wi&s;h to &s;ee probability pre&s;erved, why &s;hould we not expect this probability in the circum&s;tances of time and place; &mdash; the more pro|bability is kept up, the ea&s;ier we are deluded into what we wi&s;h; and con&s;equently the more pro|perly an author con&s;ults the material bu&s;ine&s;s of the drama; when we al&s;o add to this that the unities may do much good, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be pro|ductive of the &s;malle&s;t di&s;advantage, I don't &s;ee how a &s;ingle argument can be urged in favour of Mr. John&s;on's hypothe&s;is, to have the lea&s;t weight With an intelligent reader.</P>
<P>WHEN I look back and &s;ee what I have &s;aid, I am ab&s;olutely &s;truck with my own pre&s;umption in contradicting &s;uch a writer as Mr. John&s;on, but as I am not &s;timulated either by petulance or va|nity, I am tempted to venture it for the public opinion; and perhaps if it &s;hould be favourably received, you may hear again from yours, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AMONG the &s;everal branches of oratory which have been lately taught by the cele|brated Mr. Sheridan, I am not a little &s;urpri&s;ed that he has &s;truck out no &s;pecies of this valuable &s;cience for the u&s;e of the bar, nor thought of the <HI>proper</HI> method of in&s;tructing a pupil how to become a &s;hining ornament to the long robe, notwith|&s;tanding the variety of examples which he might find in this kingdom. Perhaps Mr. Sheridan may &s;uppo&s;e a good education, a fortunate memory, and a florid delivery, the principal requi&s;ites to form an orator for the bar. If he does, he is very much mi&s;taken; for, to the honour of the pre&s;ent era be it &s;poken, we are ble&s;t with an infinite num|ber of eminent lawyers who have become a credit to the profe&s;&s;ion without either education or me|mory, and indeed almo&s;t without any delivery at all.</P>
<P>NOR are the gentlemen in que&s;tion more gene|rally di&s;tingui&s;hed for their genius and abilities, than remarkable for their learning and elocution; on the contrary, they are univer&s;ally acknowledged to be incumbered with no great load of intellectual faculties: a happine&s;s which they them&s;elves &s;eem &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that they &s;corn to lay a claim to any qualification be&s;ides an inflexible kind of impu|dence
<PB N="190" REF="199">
which is known under the fa&s;hionable title of the <HI>Bonfront.</HI></P>
<P>AS I have paid &s;ome attention to the cu&s;tomary practice of the&s;e gentlemen, e&s;pecially in the mo&s;t material of all points, the examination of witne&s;&s;es upon life and death, I &s;hall take the liberty of lay|ing down &s;ome invariable rules for the benefit of &s;tudents, a tollerable adherence to which is more likely to render them con&s;picuous at the Bar, than the elocution of a Cicero or the Equity of a Yorke.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, let it be a fundamental maxim, with every &s;tudent, that a lawyer (who &s;hould be a gentleman and a chri&s;tian) ought upon all oc|ca&s;ions, to &s;hew a perfect contempt for decency and good manners, and maintain a laudable in&s;en&s;ibi|lity to every tender feeling which is a credit to the human brea&s;t. &mdash; It is beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, if he lays this principle for the foundation of his conduct, but he mu&s;t, in a little time, ri&s;e to the dignity of a &s;ilk gown, and pave a ready way to an ermin'd robe, and a title-giving perriwig.</P>
<P>UPON no account, let a love of ju&s;tice imperti|nently intrude it&s;elf into his thoughts, or make him imagine a moment, that whatever &s;ide of the que&s;tion he engages to &s;upport is not infalliably the be&s;t: &mdash;Let the robber confe&s;&s;ed be &s;uppo&s;ed an unfortunate &s;ufferer from malice or mi&s;take; the catamite on record a per&s;on &s;candalou&s;ly accu&s;ed; and the hand yet reeking with the blood of inno|cence, the in&s;trument of a ju&s;tice too precipitate, or
<PB N="191" REF="200">
at mo&s;t the inflicter, though of an illegal, yet an equitable revenge.</P>
<P>IF an evidence compelled to appear again&s;t his client gives a te&s;timony fair and un&s;ullied as the &s;oul of truth, every means mu&s;t be made u&s;e of to confound and perplex him; every expedient of in&s;olence and chicanery practi&s;ed to make him prevaricate; and if by &s;ome ma&s;terly &s;troke there &s;hould be a po&s;&s;ibily of making him &s;eem perjured, this violation of all law, this murder of all ju&s;tice &s;hall &s;ave the villain from the gibbet, and render the lawyer immortal.</P>
<P>WITH regard to evidence there are two methods of examination which mu&s;t never be forgot: if the per&s;on to be examined is a poor ignorant ru&s;tic, or &s;ome aukward artizan, he mu&s;t be con&s;tantly reminded that he is on his oath, and frightened into an acquie&s;cence with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance, which the council &s;hall good-naturedly make for him, to render the former part of his te&s;timony incon&s;i&s;tent, and occa&s;ion the whole to be &s;et a&s;ide; if this &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the lauda|ble purpo&s;e in view, a number of hard and diffi|cult expre&s;&s;ions may be &s;ea&s;onably introduced, the lawyer may al&s;o tell him <HI>"You &s;aid &s;o or &s;o, Sir,"</HI> (the confe&s;&s;ions which he wanth imto make) till the poor fellow, terrified at the thoughts of his oath, and almo&s;t ignorant of what he &s;ays, either in his fear or confu&s;ion &s;hall acknowledge that he did.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, when a gentleman conver&s;ant with the principles, though unacquainted with the
<PB N="192" REF="201">
infamous arts of the law, is to be called as a witne&s;s, he mu&s;t be treated with &s;currility and abu&s;e; he mu&s;t be called <HI>"you fellow,"</HI> and a&s;ked the meanlng of every obvious word in order to rou&s;e his indig|nation and throw him off his guard.&mdash;The mo|ment h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s anger appears, the council in examina|tion, mu&s;t be &s;ure to keep it up, and by convenient repetitions of the mo&s;t provoking and derogatory expre&s;&s;ions he can think of, render him incapable of giving a clear te&s;timony, and &s;o invalidate every thing he &s;ays.</P>
<P>IF it is his fortune to be on the &s;ide of the Crown, let him follow the method already laid down of examining a witne&s;s, and though the pri&s;oner's in|nocence be apparent as the &s;un, take every po&s;&s;ible means of convicting him, as it will be highly to his reputation if he can get him ca&s;t. His abilities re|ceive an additional lu&s;tre from his dexterity in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Ju&s;tice, and his character will be e&s;tabli&s;hed for life, if the guiltle&s;s unfortunate &s;hould be hanged.&mdash;Let him moreover &s;port with the hopes and fears of the unhappy wretch thus tottering on the verge of life, and humanely try every expedient to aggravate his mi&s;ery, by occa&s;io|nal puns and witti&s;ci&s;ms on &s;uch circum&s;tances in the cour&s;e of the trial, as may give him the &s;malle&s;t opportunity for a &s;troke.</P>
<P>THERE are no ill con&s;equences to be apprehended by any &s;tudent, and no re&s;entment to be dreaded from the court, from this method of going on; for, now-a-days, lawyers talk before a Bench of Judges,
<PB N="193" REF="202">
the immediate repre&s;entatives of GOD and the KING, with the &s;ame illiberal freedom as the re&s;|pectable Orators of Billing&s;gate; and u&s;e every ar|tifice for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of truth, as if it was cri|minal for ju&s;tice to be &s;ati&s;fied, and ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for <HI>Robbers</HI> and <HI>Murderers</HI> to make a tri|umphant e&s;cape. &mdash; In &s;lavi&s;h countries indeed, unin&s;pired by a &s;entiment of liberty and honour, the man who would take upon him to brow beat an evidence, would &s;tand a chance of lo&s;ing his head, and a Judge who would &s;uffer it, might feel &s;omething more than a public di&s;grace.&mdash;But in the&s;e happy regions the per&s;on in&s;ulted in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, is the only one expo&s;ed to pu|ni&s;hment, which he has more than a probability of undergoing, &s;hould he have the in&s;olence to com|plain of being &s;candalou&s;ly treated, to the court.</P>

<P>THERE is an unaccountable ambition among the generality of people, to enhance the con|&s;equence of their po&s;terity, though at their own expence; and there is &s;carcely a father within the weekly bills, but what, if we are to judge by the mode of his behaviour, thinks his &s;on a con&s;iderably better man than him&s;elf. I am naturally led into this con&s;ideration by a vi&s;it which I made to my landlord, an hone&s;t carpenter, at the we&s;t end of the town, a day or two ago, to talk with him about
<PB N="194" REF="203">
repairing my hou&s;e, and to pay him a twelvemonth's rent.</P>
<P>AS it was pa&s;t one o'clock before I &s;et out, I arrived at Mr. Roof's ju&s;t about dinner time, and without much ceremony &s;at down with the family to a leg of pork and a pea&s;e-pudding, and a couple of fine fowls with egg &s;auce. The company con|&s;i&s;ted of Mr. and Mrs. Roof, his two &s;ons, and a young lady of about nineteen, very elegantly dre&s;|&s;ed, whom I took for &s;ome per&s;on that boarded in the hou&s;e, but who, to my great &s;urprize, I found was no more than my hone&s;t landlord's daughter. Mr. Roof and his wife were very plainly decorated, but the two &s;ons had their hair done up in the <HI>ala|mode &agrave; Paris</HI> ta&s;te, and wore each a plain blue coat, and a &s;carlet wai&s;tcoat very richly laced with gold: Upon enquiry into the profe&s;&s;ions to which they were brought up, I found that the elde&s;t was a &s;ort of &s;uperintendant to his father, and that the other had, by the recommendation of a nobleman in the neighbourhood, been lately advanced to a fifty pound place in the Exci&s;e. The young gentle|men I perceived, by their conver&s;ation, looked upon them&s;elves in a very con&s;equential light, and &s;o did their &s;i&s;ter; they talked of nothing but earls and dukes, and frequently &s;wore upon their honours; whereas their father &s;carcely mentioned any thing higher than the bricklayer or timber merchant, and never pre&s;umed to &s;wear by any thing more elegant than his God.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="204">DINNER was &s;carcely over, when the young lady and the two gentlemen got up in a carele&s;s manner, and took their leaves with a polite ele|gance, taking care to let me know, however, that they were to drink tea at a gentleman's in New Bond-&s;treet, and from thence to adjourn to Covent-Garden Hou&s;e to &s;ee the Maid of the Mill, having &s;ent a per&s;on for that purpo&s;e to keep places: "Ay," &s;ays the father after their departure, <Q>Suke has been teizing us a long time to &s;ee this Opera, and &s;o Bob and Alick being di&s;engaged this evening, they agreed to go with her, and have &s;ent Ralph Jenkins, our younge&s;t apprentice to keep a row for them in one of the green boxes: For my own part, my dame and I &s;eldom go above once a year, and that is to Dick Yate's benefit; we even then &s;it in the two &s;hilling gallery, and go at half after two, for the &s;ake of getting a good place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>BUT why, Mr. Roof, (&s;ays I) do not you &s;end Ralph Jenkins to keep a place for your|&s;elf and your good woman in the boxes at the &s;ame time; it would be much more com|fortable than going &s;o very early, and running the chance of being &s;queezed to death, by crouding into the two &s;hilling gallery?</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHY, Lord, Sir, (returned my hone&s;t land|lord) you do not think it would become a poor carpenter to be elbowing it among people of fa&s;hion in the boxes: No, no, I am &s;ure you
<PB N="196" REF="205">
know a great deal better than that, and have only a mind to be a little merry with me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>YOU bring your elde&s;t &s;on I think, Mr. Roof, up to your own bu&s;ine&s;s?</Q> <Q>Yes, Sir; and a cleverer lad never &s;tepped in &s;hoe-leather; he &s;hall draw a plan, or make an e&s;timate with any carpenter in the kingdom: Nay, with Phil|lips him&s;elf, though every body mu&s;t allow him to be an honour to the bu&s;ine&s;s: And then if he was put to it to-morrow, he could get his bread as a journeyman; why, Sir, I had him the matter of four years at the bench.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WELL then, Mr. Roof, is not your &s;on a carpenter too?</Q> Undoubtedly, Sir." Then <Q>if it be improper for you as a carpenter, to &s;it in the boxes among the per&s;ons of quality, mu&s;t it not of cour&s;e be equally as improper for him?</Q></P>
<P><Q>AY, Sir, con&s;ider he dre&s;&s;es in a very diffe|rent manner from me, and that you know will make it overlooked.</Q></P>
<P><Q>TRUE, Mr. Roof, but do not you look upon your&s;elf to be as good a man as your &s;on?</Q></P>
<P>"TO be &s;ure I do Sir."</P>
<P><Q>WHY then, Mr. Roof, do not you dre&s;s as well as your &s;on?</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHY, becau&s;e I do not think it would be|come my &s;tation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEN give me leave to a&s;k you Mr. Roof, why you &s;uffer your &s;on to run into an error which you are &s;o &s;en&s;ible as to avoid it your|&s;elf?

Young men, you know, are naturally inclined to be vain; and indulgences of this nature, where a young man is obliged to live by his indu&s;try, very often di&s;qualify him for trade; as he dre&s;&s;es like a gentleman, he is ambitious of appearing like a gentleman in every re&s;pect; and will con&s;equently aim at being equally idle and extravagant: &mdash; This is one great error which I think many trade&s;men (ex|cu&s;e me my worthy friend, for it is my friend&s;hip makes me &s;peak) run into: As if their &s;ons were better men than them&s;elves, they dre&s;s them a thou&s;and times better; and not only add by this means to their con&s;titutional vanity, but give them an early turn to idlene&s;s and ex|pence: The circum&s;tance of youth can be no extenuation of the conduct; becau&s;e, if there be a degree of di&s;tinction any where due, it is to age, which is entitled to a much greater &s;hare of veneration and re&s;pect.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is no &s;ubject which at pre&s;ent employs the pens of our e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts &s;o much as <HI>Luxury.</HI> Every writer who is de&s;irous of &s;hewing a profound knowledge either in ethics or in policy, exclaims again&s;t it as a vice replete with the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equences; and in&s;i&s;ts, that it will one time or other be the utter de&s;truction of this infatuated kingdom.</P>
<P>THOUGH I am very &s;en&s;ible luxury is the com|mon parent of many con&s;iderable evils, I am at the &s;ame time perfectly &s;atisfied, it is the common parent al&s;o of the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ings in every &s;ociety; for which rea&s;on I mu&s;t differ widely in opinion from tho&s;e ingenious gentlemen, who are for having it totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and mu&s;t not only expre&s;s my wonder at the tendency of their arguments, but even in&s;i&s;t that &s;uch a circum&s;tance, &s;o far from being de&s;irable, would be the inevitable ruin of every civilized kingdom.</P>
<P>THE enemies of luxury in all the arguments I have hitherto met with, &s;eem to con&s;ider this vice, as they call it, on no more than one &s;ide: they tell us it leads us into a thou&s;and exce&s;&s;es, bur&s;ts frequently through all the laws of humanity, and excites &s;o &s;trong a propen&s;ity to plea&s;ures and
<PB N="199" REF="208">
parade, that rea&s;on is never able to govern our actions, and but &s;eldom powerful enough to keep us from the commi&s;&s;ion of any crime which has an appearance of promoting this general depravity or voluptiou&s;ne&s;s of our inclinations. With all po&s;&s;ible deference, however, to the opinion of the&s;e gentlemen, I &s;hall beg leave to a&s;k if by a &s;tate of nature they mean that original condition of man|kind, when their food was the herbage of the field, and their drink the water of the &s;pring; when their covering was the &s;kin of &s;ome leopard, and their couch the naked lap of earth; when, in &s;hort, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exten&s;ive regions, they were &s;carcely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any thing; and wan|dered, to u&s;e the poet's expre&s;&s;ion, with their only acquaintance the bea&s;ts,
<Q>Joint tenants of the &s;hade.</Q></P>
<P>In tho&s;e early ages before luxury was born, do we not read of continual frauds, oppre&s;&s;ions, and murders? Do we not find that when there were but two brothers in the whole compa&s;s of creation, one of them killed the other through envy, and hurled the bolde&s;t defiance to the very throne of his God.</P>
<P>THE principal argument which political writers have ever brought again&s;t luxury, is, that it imbecillitates the mind of every body, and from gaining a univer&s;al a&s;cendency, &s;inks a whole &s;tate at la&s;t into a degree of &s;oftne&s;s and effeminacy, which renders it utterly unfit for warlike enterpri|zes: and con&s;equently expo&s;es it to the machina|tions
<PB N="200" REF="209">
of every enemy. The Romans, &s;ay the&s;e gentlemen, while they continued undebauched by luxury could conquer the whole world; that is, in plain Engli&s;h, they could rob and murder the nations of earth, through an infamous principle of avarice which they varni&s;hed over with the name of glory.&mdash;Truly a ble&s;&s;ed effect ari&s;ing from this boa&s;ted di&s;regard of luxury!&mdash;But when (continue the &s;agacious rea&s;oners) they once &s;uffered this vice to gain footing among them, that moment they lo&s;t all their u&s;ual ardour, and were incapable of performing tho&s;e heroic atchievements which rai&s;ed their ance&s;tors to immortality; that is, to explain this principle of argument &s;till farther; being by this time poli&s;hed into &s;omething like humanity, they no longer had a pa&s;&s;ion for rapine or blood, but let other people enjoy peace and tranquility for the &s;ake of enjoying &s;o invaluable a ble&s;&s;ing them&s;elves. And this is one of the dreadful effects ari&s;ing from the prevalence of luxury. Truly a very proper &s;ubject for a morali&s;t to complain of, who feels for the private di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his country, or the general good of all man|kind.</P>
<P>IN every age &s;ince the commencement of Engli&s;h literature, poor luxury has been an ever|la&s;ting, but, as I &s;aid before, for our mortal and political writers. The fir&s;t have been continually talking how prejudicial it mu&s;t prove to individuals; and the latter have been as continually mentioning how fatal it mu&s;t inevitably turn out to kingdoms:
<PB N="201" REF="210">
yet what a pity is it that univer&s;al experience gives &s;o palpable a contradiction to all their declamati|ons! Great Britain, I grant, has for many years been ab&s;orbed in luxury, yet that luxury has ren|dered us no way effeminate. In the late war we convinced our enemies that the mo&s;t hardy aeras of the Romans republic did not exceed us in valour; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;hould ho&s;tilities re-commence to-morrow, we &s;hould give them this conviction again with the greate&s;t alacrity.</P>
<P>WITH regard to individuals, luxury may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be con&s;idered as the immediate &s;ource of their exi&s;tence. Every thing beyond the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries of life is luxury: what then would become of our merchants without it? Our commerce would in an in&s;tant be annihilated, and our manufactures totally de&s;troyed. People of fa&s;hion in&s;tead of encouraging the &s;ciences and the arts, would be hedging in the country; and our poets painters, mu&s;icians, mercers, jewellers, and in &s;hort every per&s;on of every profe&s;&s;ion would be reduced to much &s;uch a &s;ituation as the &s;avages of America. For the&s;e rea&s;ons therefore let us not rail again&s;t luxury; if in &s;ome ca&s;es it gives us de&s;ires above our &s;itua|tion, and hurries us into exce&s;&s;es, let us on the other hand look upon it as the only parent of trade, and the general &s;upport of &s;ociety; above all let the ene|mies of luxury be a little con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, and recollect, that when they advi&s;e us to grow rich by a clo&s;e application to our commerce, they in fact, advi&s;e us to be luxurious, unle&s;s they can
<PB N="202" REF="211">
prove that it is criminal to enjoy this wealth after we have acquired it; and that it is to decline the gratification of our wi&s;hes, that we &s;o ince&s;&s;antly labour for the means.</P>

<HEAD>To <HI>H. RATTLE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Harry,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE my return to Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, a mo&s;t melancholy circum&s;tance has happened in poor Dr. Winterton's family, our old tutor, which I
<PB N="203" REF="212">
&s;acrce know how to communicate, on account of &s;ome little concern which I have had in the con&s;e|quences; but as I am &s;en&s;ible you will not imagine I have any &s;elf-&s;ufficient motive to gratify by the relation, I &s;hall proceed to the particulars, with|out any further apology.</P>
<P>DOCTOR Winterton had, it &s;eems, gone indi&s;|creetly as a &s;ecurity for his wife's brother, in a much larger &s;um than his circum&s;tances could po&s;&s;i|bly bear, and the brother, being a villain, thought proper to make off a few days before the money became due; the obdurate creditor in&s;i&s;ted upon in&s;tant &s;atisfaction, and the doctor being unable to give it him, all his little effects were cruelly &s;eized, and he him&s;elf thrown into the county goal.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tance reached my ear the third day after I went down, and though you know I have very little rea&s;on to be an admirer either of the doctor or his family, as I lo&s;t my uncle Goodwin's e&s;tate by the ill-natured repre&s;entation which they gave the be&s;t action of my life, my &s;etting our old &s;chool-fellow Raymond's &s;i&s;ter up in a milliner's &s;hop; yet I determined to intere&s;t my &s;elf a little in his affairs; and thought it ungenerous to re|member any thing in the day of an enemy's ca|lamity, but the greatne&s;s of his di&s;tre&s;s. According|ly I got an intimate friend of his to prepare him for my vi&s;it, and called on him the next day: the un|happy man &s;carcely knew how to receive me; Mrs. Winterton affected to be very bu&s;y in &s;etting the
<PB N="204" REF="213">
room to order; Mi&s;s made an excu&s;e for ab&s;enting her&s;elf; the three other daughters never took their eyes from &s;ome plain work, about which they were employed; and the only per&s;on who &s;eemed rejoiced at my coming, was poor little Tommy, who is grown a mo&s;t charming boy &s;ince you &s;aw him; he ran to me the moment I came in; and crying, ah! Mr. Ha&s;tings, &s;eized hold of my coat, and hung on me with a degree of innocent &s;en&s;ibility, that almo&s;t melted me into tears.</P>
<P>AS I heartily felt for the &s;ituation of the doctor, I embraced the fir&s;t opportunity of taking him to an apartment of the goalers, where I might offer him my &s;ervice, without di&s;concerting him in the face of his family: I did &s;o in the lea&s;t offen&s;ive manner I was capable, and when I found him touched about his treatment of me to my uncle Goodwin, made u&s;e of every argument to reconcile him to him&s;elf, and applauded the goodne&s;s of his intention, without lamenting the con&s;equence which it had produced: By degrees I re&s;tored him to &s;ome appearance of chearfulne&s;s; a&s;&s;ured him, I heartily &s;ympathized in his misfor|tunes, and begged, in a manner the mo&s;t open I could a&s;&s;ume, that he would tax my ability in the pre&s;ent exigence. To a mind not utterly de&s;titute of feeling, my dear Harry, no circum&s;tance is &s;o afflictive as an obligation from a per&s;on whom we have wronged; this I fully &s;aw manife&s;ted in our old friend; He blu&s;hed ince&s;&s;antly, changed
<PB N="205" REF="214">
his &s;eat every moment, &s;till attempted to apologize for former occurrences; till at la&s;t incapable of holding it out any longer, he &s;natched my hand, ki&s;&s;ed it with vehemence, and bur&s;t into a violent floods of tears. In fact, Harry, I was as much to be pitied as him&s;elf: I was afraid every thing would carry the appearance of a triumph; and therefore &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided whatever I con&s;idered as tending to &s;o unmanly a behaviour. This enhanced the little merit of my conduct with him; and the more I endeavoured to avoid giving him an anxiety, the more I added to his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I WILL not dwell on the minuter parts of this tran&s;action; &s;uffice it, by advancing four hundred and fifty-&s;even pounds, I have brought him and his whole family back to the par&s;onage hou&s;e; and am amply overpaid by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which I flatter my&s;elf is no way culpable, I mean that of having di&s;charged a duty both as a chri&s;tian and as a man. I &s;hall be in town the fir&s;t day of term, till when, my dear Rattle, adieu, and belive me to be with an unalterable e&s;teem your own</P>

<P>THOUGH no body is better plea&s;ed to &s;ee a hu&s;band place a proper degree of confidence in his wife than my&s;elf, nor wi&s;hes more ardently to have the married ladies treated with delicacy and affection; yet there is one &s;ituation in which I am frequently &s;orry to find them di&s;tingui&s;hed with extraordinary marks of regard, and in which I think it would be much more for the credit of our under&s;tandings rather to doubt of their di&s;cretion, than to &s;uppo&s;e it im|po&s;&s;ible for them to run into capital mi&s;takes.&mdash; The &s;ituation which I here mean, is, where
<PB N="207" REF="216">
at our deaths, though we have a number of chil|dren, we rely implicitly on the tenderne&s;s of our wives, and leave our whole fortunes entirely in their power, from a prepo&s;terous opinion, that they will faithfully employ every &s;hilling for the benefit of the&s;e children, and be actuated by no other view, than a maternal concern for their hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is true when we con&s;ider the natural &s;oftne&s;s of the female character and recollect with what an aching inten&s;ene&s;s of &s;en&s;iblity, a mother general|ly beholds her own offspring; when we &s;ee a woman's life apparently depending on a child, and have be&s;ide for a long &s;eries of years experien|ced in her fidelity, every po&s;&s;ible proof of a worthy heart, and a clear under&s;tanding; it appears unac|countable that we &s;hould entertain any doubts of her tenderne&s;s, in tho&s;e la&s;t important moments, where all her feelings mu&s;t be tremblingly alive for the lo&s;s of a worthy hu&s;band, and where the unprotected &s;ituation of her little orphans, demands a double &s;hare of her affection.&mdash;Experience, how|ever, fatally convinces us, that we cannot rely with any tolerable certainty upon the conduct of the ladies in general:&mdash;Neither their e&s;teem for the memory of a man whom they once idolized; nor their fondne&s;s for the very children in whom they &s;eemed only to exi&s;t, are &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve them from &s;acrificing every thing which ought to be dear to a woman of &s;en&s;e and humanity; the mo|ment their tears are a little dried up, their hearts
<PB N="208" REF="217">
become &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;econd impre&s;&s;ions; and their unfortunate poor innocents are infamou&s;ly plun|dered, to obtain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome in&s;idious ad|mirer whom they have not known perhaps a week and who&s;e principal adoration was excited by their fortunes,</P>
<P>I am in&s;en&s;ibly led into this &s;ubject by an ap|plication which was made to me for charity ye&s;|terday morning, from a woman once the wife of my old acquaintance Tom Ea&s;y Tom was bred at Oxford, in the neighbourhood of which city, he fell accidentally in company with this lady, the daughter of an ob&s;cure clergyman, and being &s;mit|ten with her per&s;on married her at once, not re|garding in the lea&s;t her utter want of fortune;&mdash; happily for Tom, his father, who was a merchant in London, died before this marriage was di&s;|covered, otherwi&s;e it might have greatly endan|gered his inheritance; however on taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the old gentleman's e&s;tate, which con&s;i&s;ted of money in the funds to a very large amount, he brought Mrs. Ea&s;y to town, &s;et up an elegant equi|page, and lived away in a manner entirely &s;uitable to the affluence of his circum&s;tances. I have dined more than once at his hou&s;e, and never beheld a more affectionate hu&s;band.&mdash;His whole &s;tudy was to guard his wife from the unea&s;ine&s;s even of a wi&s;h, and three charming little prattlers, with which &s;he ble&s;t him, &s;o ab&s;olutely rivetted her em|pire over his heart, that he often broke out into tears of exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s, if he gazed at her
<PB N="209" REF="218">
with any extraordinary &s;hare of attention.&mdash;Un|common as the&s;e marks of regard might be con|&s;idered, Mrs. Ea&s;y, neverthele&s;s &s;eemed to merit them all; during the whole &s;eventeen years of her marriage, &s;he never knew a will but her hu&s;band's, nor ever pa&s;&s;ed a moment in the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable places of plea&s;ure, with a fiftieth part of that &s;atis|faction, which &s;he received at home from her little family.&mdash;During Tom's la&s;t illne&s;s &s;he &s;at up with him for &s;even weeks, and when, through the in|credible di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her mind and the exce&s;&s;ive fa|tigues of her per&s;on, &s;he was at la&s;t rendered una|ble to move acro&s;s the room, &s;he had a mattra&s;s brought to her hu&s;band's bed&s;ide, where &s;he con|&s;tantly echoed to his groans, and an&s;wered in a perpetual uni&s;on to the&s;e &s;orrows which &s;he could no longer attend upon, with the medicines of relief.</P>
<P>SUCH unexampled proofs of conjugal attachment de&s;erved every mark of the mo&s;t grateful acknow|ledgment, and Mr. Ea&s;y accordingly rewarded it with every &s;hilling he was worth in the world, and died perfectly &s;atisfied that &s;o excellent a woman could never deviate in the lea&s;t from the ju&s;t regard which was due to her children.&mdash;But alas, poor Tom was not buried ten weeks before this very woman gave her per&s;on and fortune to an Iri&s;h gambler; and threw both her&s;elf and her children entirely upon the capricious bounty of a ra&s;cal who was as totally lo&s;t to &s;hame, as he was de&s;titute of humanity; the con&s;equence of this unpardonable &s;tep will be ea&s;ily conceived by the reader of ima|gination;

<P>MY father, &s;ir, was an attorney of great practice in the city, lived univer&s;ally beloved, and died as univer&s;ally lamented; my mother and he had been married above &s;ixteen years, and a more af|fectionate couple was not to be met with in the kingdom, that be had at lea&s;t the mo&s;t cordial ten|derne&s;s for her, appeared &s;ufficiently evident, at the time of his decea&s;e, for he left his whole fortune entirely in her power, and a&s;&s;igned it as a rea&s;on for his conduct, that his di&s;con&s;olate relict would be &s;ure of my duty, when all my expectations de|pended upon her hand:&mdash;But alas, &s;ir, while he was thus doubtful of my behaviour to her, he did not con&s;ider the po&s;&s;iblity of her &s;werving in any points of affection to me; he did not con&s;ider that a woman with a large fortune in her pocket, whe|ther &s;he is hand&s;ome or homely, in the may-bloom of life, or in the declining vale of years, is always certain of numerous admirers; he did not more|over recollect that my mother was &s;carcely thirty-five; that &s;he was remarkably plea&s;ing in her per|&s;on; and that con&s;equently &s;he had attractions which were liable to cau&s;e a change in her condi|tion,

<P>BE this, however, as it may, the exce&s;&s;ive concern, which my mother te&s;tified for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, and the determined energy, even &s;ometimes of execration with which &s;he exclaimed again&s;t a &s;econd marriage, induced numbers to think that my father was not altogether &s;o prepo&s;te|rous in his will, e&s;pecially as I was a &s;mart boy of fifteen, rather tall for my age, and &s;eemed entire|ly to engro&s;s my mother's affection&mdash;But as <HI>Ham|let</HI> finely ob&s;erves,
<Q>Frailty! thy name is woman.</Q>
A little time, le&s;&s;ened the good lady's dete&s;tation to &s;econd marriages; in a bout three months &s;he wanted company, and to remove this di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance, admitted of vi&s;its from a few parti|cular acquaintance; in le&s;s than half a year, &s;he could &s;mile at a compliment to her looks, though &s;he was &s;en&s;ible <Q>nobody could like &s;uch an old woman as her;</Q> and before the turn of the third quarter, out of pure humanity, be&s;towed her hand upon a han&s;ome young fellow, with out a &s;hilling, who had &s;worn to de&s;troy him&s;elf, if &s;he re|pul&s;ed his addre&s;&s;es, and who doubtle&s;s was a man of too much honour, to be wor&s;e than his word.</P>
<P>TO do my father-in-law ju&s;tice however, though he was a poor man, his reputation was un&s;ullied, and he was neither de&s;titute of &s;en&s;e nor humanity; &s;o that for &s;ome time I fared tolerably well, and
<PB N="214" REF="223">
received many little in&s;tances of his good nature and affection; but unhappily, &s;ir, before the ex|piration of a year after the weding-day, my mo|ther was brought to bed of a fine boy; and I was no longer con&s;idered with any remarkable &s;hare of attention; on the contrary, the birth of this little &s;tranger rendered me a kind of interloper in the family, and it was looked upon as a mighty obligation, that I was allowed the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, out of my mi&s;guided father's fortune.&mdash;As I was young and naturally impetuous, a treatment of this kind, frequently led me into complaints, which however ju&s;tly they might be founded, were certainly injudicious, becau&s;e they might encrea&s;e the difficulties of my &s;ituation, but could not po&s;&s;ibly procure me the &s;malle&s;t redre&s;s. &mdash;They were al&s;o attended with this inconveni|ence, that they expo&s;ed me to the cen&s;ures of the world &mdash;for as long as I had a decent &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, it was thought by numbers the highe&s;t in|&s;tance of ingratitude to my father-in-law, that I pre&s;umed to find fault. &mdash; In this uncomfortable manner things continued to go on till my mother was brought to bed of another child, about which time my father-in-law, procured me a fifty pound place in the Cu&s;toms, and de&s;ired me to &s;hift for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is now five years Mr. Babler, &s;ince I ob|tain'd this trifling independence, and you may be &s;ure that I mu&s;t have practi&s;ed the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy to &s;upport my&s;elf with any tolerable
<PB N="215" REF="224">
decency in the&s;e difficult times; I am indeed welcome to a dinner occa&s;ionally at my mother's, but a &s;ingle guniea I have never received either from her or her hu&s;band, &s;ince the time I quitted the hou&s;e to the pre&s;ent hour.&mdash;Both of them behave with civility enough, but neither with any degree of affection; all their tenderne&s;s is confined to the young children; and every &s;ixpence of my poor father's money, is to be &s;et apart for tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to his name and aliens to his family; my &s;tep-brothers, and there are now no le&s;s than four, will have five thou&s;and pounds a-piece, while I who &s;hould in ju&s;tice po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole after my mother's decea&s;e, mu&s;t pro|bably &s;it down with an humble &s;uit of mourning, or even a paltry pair of gloves.</P>
<P>I HAVE introduced this little narrative, Mr. Babler, to &s;hew that where widows of fortune, who have children by a fir&s;t hu&s;band, even are happy in a &s;econd choice, and be&s;tow their per&s;ons on a man who treats them with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, the children of the former hu&s;band mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be material &s;ufferers; no people live together upon better terms than my mother and my father-in-law, yet I am injured in the highe&s;t degree not|with&s;tanding the reciprocality of their affection: The property which &s;hould have been mine is now my father-in-law's entirely, and it is but rea|&s;onable he &s;hould give every preference to his own children:&mdash;Nay, &s;uppo&s;ing my mother had &s;till retained every thing in her own hands, the i&s;&s;ue of

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH the ob&s;ervation is not over new, it is neverthele&s;s extremely ju&s;t, that the life of man is marked by di&s;&s;atisfaction, and that in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;ituation of our circum&s;tances, we are &s;till pretty certain to repine under the hand of di&s;content.</P>
<P>I WAS educated for the church, Mr. Babler, and having but &s;mall expectation of preferment, I endeavoured pretty &s;ucce&s;sfully to accommodate my mind to the narrowne&s;s of my expectations, and
<PB N="217" REF="226">
flattered my&s;elf that I &s;hould be the happie&s;t man in the world, could I get but a curacy of fifty pounds a year &mdash; on this I thought, I could provide every thing in a hand&s;ome manner, and when I was fortunate enough to be appointed to an income of &s;uch a &s;um, I actually lived for &s;ome time highly to my &s;atisfaction; had a decent apartment, owed no man a &s;hilling, and never wanted tho&s;e two capital e&s;&s;entials in the compound of &s;ublunary fe|licity, a mortuary guinea and a clean &s;hirt.</P>
<P>I HAD not however been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my curacy, before an increa&s;e of acquaintance brought on an encrea&s;e of wants; I found that I had deceived my&s;elf when I thought of circum|&s;cribing my wi&s;hes within &s;uch a trifle as fifty pounds: A hundred I then a&s;pired at, with all the eagerne&s;s my character could po&s;&s;ibly admit, and was certain that this &s;um would entirely an&s;wer all my wi&s;hes. &mdash; Well Sir, this hundred was at la&s;t obtained, and I &s;et my&s;elf down for an uninter|rupted round of happine&s;s. &mdash; But &s;ee the futility of all human expectations; my de&s;ires were again en|crea&s;ed with my fortune, and though my circum|&s;tances, were now doubled, I did not find my&s;elf in the lea&s;t richer than when I was confined to my humble fifty pounds&mdash; What was &s;till more extra|ordinary, I did not live a bit better than formerly; I &s;eldom had more than the &s;ame &s;imple joint of meat, and the &s;ame moderate gla&s;s of punch as u&s;ual. My dre&s;s could undergo &s;carce any altera|tion; and as I &s;till lived in the country, and was a
<PB N="218" REF="227">
batchelor, I had no great occa&s;ion to enhance the elegance of my apartment &mdash; My expences there|fore were accumulated in mere articles of di&s;&s;ipation which could be of little &s;ervice to my&s;elf, and of le&s;s advantage to &s;ociety; I received continued in|vitations from &s;ome of the families round my pa|ri&s;h, to pa&s;s an evening, and to make one at a party of cards; here I generally lo&s;t a &s;hilling or two every night, and as I was above living upon any body, I now and then reque&s;ted the company of my ho&s;pitable friends, batchelor as I was, with their whole families; by this means, though I re|&s;ided in a very cheap part of the country, the pro|fits of my pari&s;h were commonly eaten up, by the time they became due, and I found my&s;elf even in a more embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, than when I had but half the &s;ame revenue for my &s;upport.</P>
<P>I NOW began to think, Mr. Babler, that a hun|dred pounds a year, was infinitely too &s;mall an allowance, for the maintainance of any gentleman, and therefore as my per&s;on was not very di&s;agree|able, I fancied matrimony as the mo&s;t likely ex|pedient to arrive at competence and content; in pur&s;uance of this opinion, I accordingly looked out for a wi&s;e with money, and in a &s;hort time had the good fortune to marry a very de&s;erving woman with eight thou&s;and pounds &mdash; Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a hand&s;ome &s;um, I con&s;idered it as nothing more than a proper compliment to my wife, to live away for &s;ome time, and therefore &s;et up a &s;mart po&s;t-chai&s;e, and acquired an additional &s;hare of re&s;pect through
<PB N="219" REF="228">
the whole neighbourhood. But alas, Sir, while I kept my po&s;t-chai&s;e, I was obliged to make a &s;uita|ble appearance in every other article of my ex|pence &mdash; My table was furni&s;hed &s;umptuou&s;ly, and tho&s;e who were formerly among my mo&s;t intimate acquaintance, now thought me too great for their company; and in&s;tead of tho&s;e cordial &s;alutes of unaffected regard, which I was once &s;ecure of re|ceiving in every quarter, I met with nothing but a di&s;tant bow of lifele&s;s re&s;pect: This revolution however it gave me unea&s;ine&s;s, apparently gratified the pride of my wife; &s;he like the generality of her &s;ex, was fond of glitter and parade, and openly rejoiced that we were extending the elegant circle of our vi&s;itors: &s;he piqued her&s;elf particularly on giving the be&s;t entertainments of any body in the country, and never &s;aw a new gown or a fre&s;h or|nament upon her friends, but what &s;he was certain of having a richer &s;ilk, or a more valuable trinket, to appear in if po&s;&s;ible the next &s;unday. &mdash; Thus Mr. Babler, the number of wants which followed the enlargement of my circum&s;tances, reduced me to my original &s;ituation, and I had ju&s;t as much money to command when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of five hundred a year, as I was ma&s;ter of at my fir&s;t &s;etting out.</P>
<P>MY lot, Sir, is however infinitely more uncom|fortable, if I le&s;&s;en my port, or di&s;engage my&s;elf from the company of tho&s;e with whom I have a&s;&s;ociated &s;ince my marriage, I am &s;ure of being treated with ridicule or contempt; be&s;ides to let your readers into a &s;ecret, I am what many wi&s;er
<PB N="220" REF="229">
men than my&s;elf have been in all ages, nothing more than the &s;econd per&s;on in my own hou&s;e. Mrs. Ca&s;&s;ock, you mu&s;t know, has a great &s;pirit: &s;he is al&s;o of a good family, and as every thing originally proceeded from her, I think her rather entitled to &s;ome indulgences. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, though I could perhaps &s;tand the &s;evere&s;t bolts of ridicule, I am fearful to propo&s;e any &s;alutary re|duction in my expences; and yet, Sir, the difficulty I have to make matters meet in the end is incon|ceivable; with all this &s;wellingne&s;s of appearance, I am frequently obliged to expo&s;e my nece&s;&s;ities, and to borrow twenty or thirty pounds from &s;ome of tho&s;e very people who&s;e acquaintance the vanity of my wife, has &s;o fooli&s;hly thrown off. Our high|bred friends mu&s;t not for the world be made ac|quainted that we want a &s;um of money till the four per cents&punc; are paid at the bank in London. &mdash; That would le&s;&s;en us for ever in their e&s;teem; but we can meanly &s;toop to &s;ollicit a favour from tho&s;e whom we have in&s;ulted; and become ab&s;olute &s;uitors for the occa&s;ional good nature of the people whom we have treated with the mo&s;t in&s;uperable contempt.</P>
<P>THIS, Mr. Babler, to a man of any &s;en&s;ibility is a very grating &s;ituation &mdash; I am a beggar in the mid&s;t of affluence, and by too prodigal a u&s;e of tho&s;e favours with which providence has been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s me, I feel all the wants of the mo&s;t pungent di&s;tre&s;s. I am &s;en&s;ible what &s;teps I ought to pur&s;ue, yet actually want the re&s;olution to be
<PB N="221" REF="230">
right; and though I know that a goal mu&s;t be my inevitable portion in two or three years, with|out I immediately alter my plan of living, &s;till the fear of giving unea&s;ine&s;s to a woman I love, un|mans my temper, and I am rather more inclined to &s;uffer even &s;uch a di&s;grace, than to give her any occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect either my gratitude or my love.</P>
<P>NOW, Sir, that I have wrote this letter I &s;carcely know for what purpo&s;e; but as it may po&s;&s;ibly warn giddy-headed people from extravagance at their fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world; and &s;hew your readers that the man who would be truly happy mu&s;t always live within the limits of his circum|&s;tances, I &s;hall even &s;end it to you, and am your very humble &s;ervant,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF the gentleman who wrote the la&s;t letter in your entertaining paper, has rea&s;on to complain of his lady's &s;pirit as the cau&s;e of an impoveri&s;h|ment in his circum&s;tances, you will think my ca&s;e a &s;till more extraordinary, as well as a &s;till more lamentable one, who am actually undoing, by the oeconomy of a wife, and have the plea&s;ure of hear|ing my Turtle continually expatiating on the
<PB N="222" REF="231">
mighty merits of her prudence and management, in proportion as &s;he pu&s;hes me &s;till nearer to the verge of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>MY entrance into the world, Mr. Babler, was as promi&s;ing as mo&s;t people's. I had a good two thou&s;and a year to my fortune, and my wife, who was the only daughter of an antient family, brought me thirty thou&s;and pounds: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an affluence one would &s;carce imagine that my cir|cum&s;tances could have been prejudiced by the pru|dent management of my help-mate; or &s;uppo&s;e that any thing but the mo&s;t unbounded prodigality could, in le&s;s than three years, run me behind hand in the full &s;um of fifty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>MY wife, Mr. Babler, is de&s;cended from a family, the female branches of which have for many years been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome remarkable pecu|liarity; her great grandmother in Charles the &s;e|cond's time, cured the be&s;t hams in all England; her grandmother never wore any ribbands but orange colour after the revolution. Her aunt Molly always rode her hor&s;e like a man, and her mother never &s;at down to a knuckle of veal without eating two pounds; Sukey, at a very early age, was di&s;covered to have her peculiarity too: in her little intercour&s;es with her play-fellows, &s;he would purcha&s;e all their toys at an inferior rate, and wait with the nice&s;t circum&s;pection till &s;he &s;aw a wax-doll very vi&s;ibly wanting in a young lady's affection. By this means &s;he became mi&s;tre&s;s of more playthings than all her acquaintance put together, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in
<PB N="223" REF="232">
the minds of her doating relations &s;uch extraordi|nary ideas of her &s;agacity as made them regard her with an equal degree of tenderne&s;s and admiration.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame peculiarity which di&s;tingui&s;hed her early years, now continues to mark her conduct, and her whole &s;tudy is to obtain what the world calls <HI>a bargain,</HI> without ever con&s;idering whether &s;he has the lea&s;t occa&s;ion in nature for the com|modity which &s;he purcha&s;es; hence, &s;he is eternally running from auction to auction, from broker to broker, and from &s;hop to &s;hop. Wherever there is the lea&s;t probability of coming at a bargain, they are always &s;ure of Mrs. Bu&s;y's company, and it is a matter of little con&s;equence whether &s;he bids for a piece of porcelain, or an hog&s;head of tobacco, a Michael Angelo, or a parcel of &s;alt beef &mdash; Let there be but the appearance of a bargain, let her only know that the thing is &s;old beneath it's intrin&s;ic value, and that is a temptation not to be with|&s;tood; &s;he &s;trikes off an agreement at once, and kindly leaves the payment of the money to poor pill garlick.</P>
<P>THROUGH this unaccountable humour, Mr. Babler, I have &s;carce a room in my hou&s;e but what is crammed with &s;ome of Mrs. Bu&s;y's oeconomical purcha&s;es. I have more china, Sir, than is requ&s;ite to fit out an Ea&s;t-Indiaman in her return, and more gla&s;s than the large&s;t manufactory in England. I have above three thou&s;and Turkey carpets rotting in my garrets, and five hundred dozen of as good buck handled knives and forks ru&s;ting in my cellars,
<PB N="224" REF="233">
as ever attacked a buttock of beef, or an apple dump|ling. In &s;hort Sir, notwith&s;tanding all the heaps of money which Mrs. Bu&s;y has &s;quandred in the pro&s;ecution of her ridiculous propen&s;ity, &s;he has not laid out &s;o l&agrave;rge a &s;um as five pounds upon any one article that could either be of the lea&s;t u&s;e, or the &s;malle&s;t elegance in her family. On the con|tray, her purcha&s;es have been chiefly trumpery, which were le&s;&s;ened in their value by neglect, and owed the mighty merit of their cheapne&s;s to the univer&s;al contempt in which they were held by every &s;en&s;ible chapman.</P>
<P>I DO not &s;end you this little narrative, Mr. Babler, with a view of working upon the temper of my wife, or the pity of your readers. As to my wife, I have talked often enough to her, to know the in|efficacy of the &s;ounde&s;t rea&s;onings; and as to your readers, I neither want their pity nor de&s;ire it. My &s;ole motive for this publication is, to inform the world that for the future I &s;hall not be an&s;werable for her whim&s;ies.

<P>NOTHING is more cu&s;tomary with mo&s;t people, than when they them&s;elves have made an injudi|cious choice either in friend&s;hip or in love, to ex|claim at once again&s;t the world; and to declare that no con&s;ideration &s;hall ever induce them to honour any body with their good opinion, a &s;econd time; in pur&s;uance of this &s;trange re&s;olution, they act as if every body was unworthy of a place in their e&s;teem; and make the behaviour of a &s;ingle individual an invariable &s;tandard for the integrity of the whole univer&s;e. Hence they are continually tortured with the &s;evere&s;t pangs of anxiety and &s;u&s;picion: wear away their exi&s;tence in an open warfare with &s;ociety; and die as unlamented as they have lived unbeloved.</P>
<P>A SENSIBLE mind &s;hould, however, con&s;ider that the tempers of mankind are not le&s;s oppo&s;ite than their various complexions; and that nothing can be a greater act of inju&s;tice, than to entertain an ungenerous apprehen&s;ion of our whole acquaint|ance, merely becau&s;e we have been deceived by any particular one. If we examine into the ge|neral cour&s;e of our connexions, whether they are founded upon friend&s;hip or e&s;tabli&s;hed upon love,
<PB N="227" REF="236">
we &s;hall find that &s;o far from having any right to quarrel with the world, the world will upon the whole appear not a little entitled to our regard, &s;ince in the general, we meet with a much greater &s;hare of &s;incerity both in friend&s;hip and in love, than what from the ridiculous nature of our at|tachments, we have any probable rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>NOW a days what is it which forms the foun|dation of our friend&s;hips or con&s;titutes the ba&s;is of our loves? Is it a &s;imilarity in our manners or an agreement in our pur&s;uits; a conformity in our virtues, or a re&s;emblance in our crimes? Alas the&s;e que&s;tions if candidly an&s;wered, mu&s;t load us with confu&s;ion and reproach. In the choice of our friends it is not an excellence of under&s;tanding or a benignity of heart, which produces our intimacy, or attracts our e&s;teem. It is not the &s;ugge&s;tion of our virtues which is con&s;ulted in the choice of our friends, but the depravity of our inclinations: does a man drink a bottle more than the generality of our companions &mdash; good &mdash; that man is a very hone&s;t fellow &mdash; and very proper to be &s;et down as a friend: does another tell a &s;tory, &s;ing a &s;ong &mdash; or &s;pend the &s;ub&s;tance of other people with an un|common degree of &s;pirit? Better and better, &mdash; there can be no doubt of his worth; and we clap him in our hearts <HI>core,</HI> as Hamlet has it, In our <HI>heart of hearts:</HI> or has a third butchered his neighbour in &s;ome &s;candalous quarrel, ari&s;ing from the outragious exce&s;s of midnight profligacy? Be&s;t of all &mdash; Such a friend is ine&s;timable &mdash; An intimacy with him is
<PB N="228" REF="237">
not more flattering to our pride than agreeable to our wi&s;hes; we mention his heroi&s;m upon every occa&s;ion and in proportion to the clo&s;ene&s;s of our acquaintance, we con&s;tantly claim a &s;hare in the lu&s;tre of his reputation.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MAKE no doubt, Sir, but the conduct of a weekly e&s;&s;ay mu&s;t be very trouble&s;ome, and that a great part of your labours are un&s;een; &s;pent in efforts that produce nothing; and thrown away upon &s;ubjects that are found barren in the ex|periment.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould at any time be at a lo&s;s for a &s;ub|ject, I flatter my&s;elf, you would find &s;omething new in the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e ob&s;cure ages, which modern readers have hitherto thought unworthy of their curio&s;ity, and which lie de&s;erted becau&s;e unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="239">THE hi&s;tory of the unfortunate Aranthes and A&s;pa&s;ia is among this number, and though their epitaph at Lyons in France, has been printed in our books of travels, yet their &s;tory at length is but little known.</P>
<P>ARANTHES was &s;on to the governor of one of the Mediterranean i&s;lands, and favoured with all the advantages of nature, fortune and education. A&s;pa&s;ia was a Greek lady, beautiful beyond expre&s;|&s;ion, and admired by all the youth of Athens, which was then the place of concour&s;e for all the polite of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>THEIR mutual merit &s;oon produced a mutual e&s;teem, and this was after &s;ome time converted into the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion. They both indulged the hopes of being happy in each other for life, when Aranthes returning home to obtain his father's con&s;ent, was taken by a pirate, &s;old into the internal parts of Africa, and there condemned to toil with the mo&s;t unremitting &s;everity.</P>
<P>IN the mean time A&s;pa&s;ia felt all that love and impatience could in&s;pire; one year pa&s;&s;ed away without hearing any news from her lover, another came, but &s;till the &s;ame &s;ilence; at length an ac|count arrived that Aranthes was no more, &s;o that A&s;pa&s;ia now lo&s;t her love in de&s;peration.</P>
<P>TIME that obliterates every pa&s;&s;ion, by degrees a&s;&s;uaged the pain, which was felt by A&s;pa&s;ia, &s;he was at la&s;t brought to li&s;ten to new addre&s;&s;es, and &s;o far prevailed upon by the admonitions of her pa|rents, that &s;he con&s;ented to go into France with
<PB N="231" REF="240">
an old merchant who de&s;igned her for his &s;on, then in Africa, trading with the natives of that barba|rous region. Her voyage was &s;ucce&s;sful, and if her refined manners charmed the old man, the &s;on who &s;oon after returned was not le&s;s enchanted.</P>
<P>A DAY was fixed for their nuptials; and as he was the mo&s;t opulent man of the country, all the inhabitants came &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to offer their con|gratulations, and in order to add &s;till greater &s;plen|dour to the &s;olemnity, the young merchant who was to be bridegroom, made her a pre&s;ent of fifty &s;laves, who were at that time ju&s;t landed, and within half a day's journey to attend her.</P>
<P>AS the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a number of &s;laves, it was thought would add to the magnificence of the entertainment, they were led up to the mer|chant's palace, loaded with merchandizes as was then the cu&s;tom, and bending beneath their &s;or|rows and fatigue. A&s;pa&s;ia felt all that humanity can in&s;pire upon the &s;ight of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, while they pa&s;&s;ed on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively before her. But what could equal her emotions when among the hind|mo&s;t of tho&s;e unhappy wretches, &s;he beheld her own Aranthes emaciated with labour and afflic|tion, and with his eyes unalterably fixed upon the ground. She gave a loud convul&s;ive &s;hriek and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s into the arms of her attendants. As her &s;ituation naturally drew the eyes of all upon her, Aranthes &s;aw once again the dear object of his earlie&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and flew with ha&s;te to her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Their &s;tory and his misfortunes were &s;oon
<PB N="232" REF="241">
made known to the company, and the young mer|chant, with peculiar genero&s;ity, re&s;igned his mi&s;tre&s;s to the more early claim of Aranthes.</P>
<P>WERE this &s;tory a novel, it would end with the greate&s;t propriety in this place; but truth di&s;|agreeably lengthens the account, for one day, &s;itting in a window of one of the apartments, happy in each other, and flu&s;hed with expectations of &s;till greater rapture, a youth who with a bow had been &s;hooting at birds in a neighbouring grove, drew it at random, and the arrow pierced both lovers at the &s;ame time. Thus a life of misfortune was terminated by as unfortunate an end. They were both laid in the &s;ame grave, and their epitaph &s;till continues legible, though erected near a thou&s;and years, a monument at once both of the caprice of their fate, and of their mutual fidelity.</P>
<P>I SHALL not make any addition to this &s;tory, Mr. Babler, by unnece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations &mdash; If the &s;tory it&s;elf is not worth the attention of your read|ers, it can receive no benefit from any remarks of mine; &s;o that I &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s no longer on your patience than to a&s;&s;ure you, with how much re|gard,</P>

<P>THE character of an author is what &s;uch numbers are ambitious of obtaining, that every day produces &s;ome addition to the republic of letters, and &s;hews us a great many hone&s;t gen|tlemen who imagine, that the publication of a book, let it be never &s;o u&s;ele&s;s or de&s;picable, mu&s;t rai&s;e them in the e&s;timation of the world, as if the &s;ure&s;t way to e&s;tabli&s;h an idea of the under&s;tandings, was to prove them&s;elves triflers or fools. For my own part, great a partiality as I may feel for the productions of the pre&s;s, I &s;et but a very &s;mall value on tho&s;e works which are not likely to be of &s;ervice to &s;ociety. The mo&s;t ingenious treati&s;e on the wing of a butter-fly, has but very little merit in my opinion; and my ridicule is much more ea&s;ily moved where a man of real talents takes an infinite deal of pains to prove &s;ome hypothe&s;is, which, when it is proved, does not &s;ignify a &s;ixpence to the world, than where I &s;ee a writer &s;etting out to gain &s;ome point which will be really advantageous to mankind, but failing through an obvious want of abilities, in the attainment of his end.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, no part of literature in which men of genius are &s;o apt to trifle, or in which blockheads are &s;o apt to be in&s;ufferable, as in poetry. Who, for in&s;tance, that reads Mr. Pope's <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> can forbear lamenting to find
<PB N="234" REF="243">
&s;o much &s;terling fancy and exqui&s;ite ver&s;ification thrown away upon a &s;ubject which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of the &s;malle&s;t benefit to the reader. Perhaps of all the pieces which this great man ever pub|li&s;hed the <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> is the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and poetical; yet mu&s;t it not grieve a con&s;iderate mind to recollect, that the <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> is at be&s;t but a glittering toy; an elevated gewgaw, merely capable of amu&s;ing the fancy, but no way calcu|lated to enlarge the under&s;tanding. Mu&s;t it not grieve a con&s;iderate mind to &s;ee tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing abilities prodigally &s;quandered on &s;uch de&s;picable objects, when the choice of &s;ubjects &s;uited to their natural dignity would have afforded the world a &s;till greater degree of entertainment, and given it be&s;ides the mo&s;t ample and &s;alutary &s;ources of in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>IT is a very ab&s;urd opinion which a great many people adopt in regard to the end of poetry. So it amu&s;es the fancy, they imagine it may neglect the heart; and &s;o it tickles the ear in an agreeable manner, they never once trouble them&s;elves about the effect which it is likely to have upon the un|der&s;tanding: thus they conclude, that the mo&s;t exalted walk of all literature is to be the lea&s;t u&s;e|ful to the world, and &s;et down men of inferior ta|lents only as the proper in&s;tructors of &s;ociety. Ab|&s;urd as this opinion is, it has neverthele&s;s a prodi|gious number of advocates; and the generality of our modern poets &s;eem to be &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied of it's ju&s;tice, that one half of our compo&s;itions
<PB N="235" REF="244">
are nothing more than elegies on linnets or black-birds&mdash;De&s;criptions of a river or a meadow&mdash;ver&s;es to the &s;pring &mdash; and ballads about milliners girls and mantua-makers apprentices.</P>
<P>DID the&s;e worthy gentlemen, however, con&s;ider, that poetry is to the full as capable of improving the mind, as of amu&s;ing the imagination, perhaps they would endeavour to give us &s;ome gleams of common &s;en&s;e in their productions&mdash;Did they con|&s;ider, that the principal number of our celebrated poets, while they entertained us with the fine&s;t ebullitions of genius, have given us al&s;o the &s;ound|e&s;t le&s;&s;ons of morality; and did they con&s;ider, that the harmony of numbers is almo&s;t entirely calcu|lated to enforce the &s;entiments of virtue more &s;trongly on our bo&s;oms, they might be kindly led to mix a little rea&s;on now and then with their rhyme, and induced to believe, that the mo&s;t poli&s;hed ver|&s;ification is but a poor apology for dullne&s;s and in|&s;ipidity.</P>
<P>THE herd of modern ver&s;ifiers unfortunately copy nothing but the defects of our celebrated writers. In&s;tead of endeavouring to imitate the exalted flights of a Pope, they only follow him where he evidently de&s;cends; and becau&s;e he, or becau&s;e other great men like Scipio and Laelius, have employed them&s;elves in &s;kimming &s;ome little poe|tical pebbles on the &s;urface of genius, they claim an everla&s;ting privilege to trifle al&s;o, and run con|tinually into their faults without once &s;piritedly at|tempting to reach the lea&s;t of their perfections.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="245">IT is in reality &s;urpri&s;ing, when the main end of literature is to make mankind wi&s;er and better, that the pre&s;s is uncea&s;ingly teeming with produc|tions which often want even the negative merit, of having no harm to countenance the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their &s;tupidity. Whoever is de&s;irous of being an author &s;hould always carefully attend to this mate|rial circumance, the in&s;truction of his reader; he &s;hould judiciou&s;ly con&s;ider with him&s;elf, whether the publication, which he is about to make, is &s;uch as can either be &s;erviceable to the judgment or the heart; advantageous to the cau&s;e of good &s;en&s;e, or beneficial to the intere&s;ts of morality: unle&s;s it an|&s;wers one of the&s;e ends, he never can promi&s;e him|&s;elf either profit or reputation, and it will be much more for his credit to continue in his u&s;ual &s;tate of ob&s;curity, than to call for the attention of the world to &s;hew him&s;elf a weak or a worthle&s;s member of the community.</P>

<P>IT &s;ometimes happens that men, who make the mo&s;t dangerous deviations from the laws of &s;o|ciety, and the principles of virtue, in a great mea|&s;ure, owe their crimes to the very benevolence of their hearts; and that in the mid&s;t of all their guilt we find a dignity of &s;oul which commands our highe&s;t admiration.</P>

time in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of harmony under the &s;ame roof; and the &s;everity of their former &s;itua|tion producing a nece&s;&s;ary regulation in their ex|pences, they were every day ri&s;ing no le&s;s in opu|lence than in felicity, when an unexpected mis|fortune left them in the moment of their utmo&s;t &s;ecurity without &s;helter and without bread: old Mr. Lee&s;on, finding his health very much impair|ed, and conceiving a di&s;gu&s;t moreover at the part in which he re&s;ided, becau&s;e his friends had not formerly been &s;o ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his nece&s;&s;i|ties, as he had rea&s;on to expect; re&s;olved with the concurrence of his &s;on to di&s;po&s;e of his e&s;tate, and to make an adequate purcha&s;e in the neighbour|hood of Dublin, where he might have an oppor|tunity of con&s;ulting the be&s;t Phy&s;icians, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a more agreeable circle of acquaintance: pur&s;uant to this plan, he &s;old every acre he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, had the purcha&s;e money home in bills, and was preparing to &s;et off for another part of the king|dom in a day or two, when an accidental fire reduced his habitation to an heap of a&s;hes, de|&s;troyed all his effects, and gave him &s;carcely a moment more than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of his family: Frank, who&s;e whole property was al&s;o in bills, and packed up ready for the intended departure, lo&s;t all in the general ca|lamity, and was obliged together with his father, his mother and his wife, to take refuge at a neigh|bouring gentleman's for a few days, till they were in a capacity of reaching the metropolis,

where Frank expected from &s;ome letters which he obtained to the lord Lieutenant, to procure a little e&s;tabli&s;hment either in the army or the public offices.</P>
<P>ON the arrival of our unfortunate family in town, young Mr. Lee&s;on applied him&s;elf indu&s;|triou&s;ly to profit by his recommendations; but alas, though he met with civility, he could obtain no relief; every fre&s;h application gave him nothing but fre&s;h occa&s;ion to lament the mi&s;erable pro&s;pect before him; and while he was continually cheer|ing every bo&s;om at home with the &s;peedy expecta|tion of halcyon days, he had nothing but de&s;pair in his own. At length, de&s;truction became too evident to be concealed; his father who was now confined to his bed, had been a whole day without &s;u&s;tenance, and young Mrs. Lee&s;on was every hour trembling, le&s;t the pains of parturiency &s;hould oblige her to &s;olicit the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the public; thus &s;ituated, torn with a thou&s;and pangs, for a wife who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his highe&s;t e&s;teem; for a father whom he almo&s;t wor&s;hipped, and a mother whom he tenderly loved; Frank &s;allied out one evening into the &s;treets and &s;topping a gentleman, who&s;e appearance indicated opulence, he demand|ed his money with &s;uch a wildne&s;s of accent, that the gentleman terrified out of his wits, immedi|ately gave him a pur&s;e of fifty guineas, and Frank eagerly retreated to his lodgings, depo&s;iting the money with his father, and telling him he had re|ceived it from the lord Lieutenant's order, as an

<P>NEXT morning, however, the robbery became noi&s;ed abroad, and to the great &s;urprize of every body a merchant of the fir&s;t character and fortune was apprehended for the fact and lodged in Newgate; on the earlie&s;t knowledge of this circum&s;tance, Frank immediately wrote to the innocent gentle|man, de&s;iring him to be under no apprehen&s;ion, for if he was not honourably acquitted, the per&s;on actually guilty would on the day of trial appear in court, acknowledge his crime, and &s;urrender him|&s;elf to the violated laws of his country; the gen|tleman naturally read his letter to every body, but though &s;uch as were his friends, talked of it as a mo&s;t extraordinary affair, the generality of people, con&s;idered it as a de&s;picable artifice calculated to impo&s;e on the credulity of the public; however, the day of trial at la&s;t came; and notwith&s;tanding the merchant's character appeared irreproachable before this unfortunate &s;tain; notwith&s;tanding &s;everal per&s;onages of the highe&s;t figure, proved him a man remarkably nice in his principles and opulent in his circum&s;tances; the pro&s;ecutor was &s;o po&s;itive in his charge, and a number of circum|&s;tances &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly concurred, that he was actu|ally convicted; and the judge proceeding to &s;entence, when a loud noi&s;e of <HI>make way</HI> ran through the

<P><Q>YOU &s;ee before you, my Lord, an unhappy young man, who once little thought of violating the laws of his country, and who wi&s;hed rather to be the friend, than the enemy of Society; but who knows to what he may be urged in the hour of a piercing calamity; to what he may be wrought when de&s;titute of friends and de&s;titute of bread? I my lord, was born a gentleman and bred one; &s;ix months ago I was ma&s;ter of an ea&s;y fortune, but an accidental fire in a moment redu|ced me to beggery, and what &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, reduced al&s;o an infirm and excellent father, an aged and tender mother, together with the be&s;t of women and the be&s;t of wives to the &s;ame lamentable &s;ituation; encouraged by &s;ome recom|mendations to the great, we came up to town, and expected a decent means of procuring a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; but alas, my Lord, tho&s;e who want compa&s;&s;ion mo&s;t, are tho&s;e who are mo&s;t commonly di&s;regard|ed; in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;tance we received compliments, and met with the bow of a frigid politene&s;s, where we looked for the bounteous hand of relief; &s;o that in a little time, our all was totally ex|hau&s;ted; and my unhappy father with the vener|able partner of his youth were above a day with|out any &s;u&s;tenance what&s;oever, when unable to &s;ee them expiring for food, I ru&s;hed forth; and com|mitted
<PB N="242" REF="251">
the robbery, for which this gentleman now pri&s;oner at the bar has been condemned.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS was not the whole of my affliction; a fond de&s;erving wife, who had brought me a plen|tiful fortune, lay al&s;o peri&s;hing with hunger, and that too in a &s;ituation which demanded the ten|dere&s;t attention, and the mo&s;t immediate regard: &s;uch, my Lord, were my motives for that un|ju&s;tifiable action. Had the gentleman con|demned, been happily acquitted, I had not made this public acknowledgment of my guilt: heaven only knows what I have &s;uffered during his con|finement; but the empire of the univer&s;e would not bribe me to injure him farther; nor tempt me by an infamous &s;acrifice of his life, to con&s;ult the &s;afety of my own. Here then, my Lord, I claim his &s;entence, and demand his bonds. Provi|dence will, I doubt not, now take care of my innocent family, who are equally ignorant of my crime, and my &s;elf-accu&s;ation. For my own part, I am re&s;igned; and I feel nothing in con&s;equence of my approaching fate, but from what I am &s;en&s;ible my mi&s;erable friends mu&s;t &s;uffer on my account.</Q></P>
<P>HERE Mr. Lee&s;on ended, and the whole court was lo&s;t in approbation and tears&mdash;He was, how|ever condemned, but pardoned the &s;ame day; and his character &s;uffered &s;o little upon this occa&s;ion, that the Lord Lieutenant gave him, with his life, a place of &s;even hundred pounds a year, while the

merchant, who had been accu&s;ed from re&s;embling him exce&s;&s;ively, dying &s;ometime after without i&s;&s;ue left him his whole fortune, as a reward for &s;o ex|emplary an act of ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity.</P>

<P>WHAT kind of corporeal qualities may go to the compo&s;ition of a fiddler I neither know, nor am I very &s;olicitous of being informed. I cannot however help thinking, but what they might &s;it as quietly in their &s;eats, as their payma&s;ters the public. During the cour&s;e of an evening's enter|tainment not one in a hundred of the auditors find it nece&s;&s;ary to go out. Why therefore the whole band of mu&s;ic, &s;hould have occa&s;ion to interrupt us regularly every half hour is &s;omewhat extraor|dinary. A little common-&s;en&s;e cannot &s;urely pre|judice the nicety of their ears, or the expertne&s;s of their fingers; and if not, what excu&s;e can they po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ign for a behaviour &s;o generally di&s;|agreeable to the town, and &s;o palpably below the practice of any men who pretended in the lea&s;t ei|ther to manners or to mode&s;ty?</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="254">IT is a circum&s;tance mentioned highly to the ho|nour of the late prince of Wales his maje&s;ty's father, that having by &s;ome unavoidable accident out&s;taid his time one evening when he had commanded a play, he was no &s;ooner informed that the audience had been obliged to wait in con&s;equence of his delay, then he pulled out his watch in the full face of the hou&s;e, as if he had recognized his error, and bowed with &s;uch an acknowledgment of gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion, as rendered him inconceivably ami|able from his little mi&s;take. With all po&s;&s;ible deference to the gentlemen of the catgut, and the profe&s;&s;ors of the pipe, I think the prince of Wales a per&s;onage of as much con&s;equence as the be&s;t of them; and therefore if an apology was amiable in him for detaining an audience &s;ome minutes from a favourite entertainment, it mu&s;t be thought a little pre&s;umptuous in them to be perpetually di&s;turbing it. It is not however the members of the band to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf; it is to their <HI>immediate</HI> ma&s;ters, and I flatter my&s;elf after what I have here &s;aid, I &s;hall have but little occa&s;ion to expatiate on the &s;ubject for the future, as the ma|nagers have good-&s;en&s;e, and the public have re|collection.</P>
<P>THE next abu&s;e which I think wants refor|mation in our theatres, is the practice which &s;ome of the capital performers have of rai&s;ing the price of the Pitt at their benefits. This of all the acts of pre&s;umption, which I ever remember in the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the &s;tage is by much the mo&s;t glaring
<PB N="246" REF="255">
and unpardonable; and if it &s;hould be tolerated but a few &s;ea&s;ons longer, there is no knowing to what lengths the temerity may be carried. I am far from being an enemy to the drama; on the contrary, I wi&s;h particularly well to the actors; and am never better plea&s;ed than when I &s;ee their merits properly rewarded, by the munificence of the public. But I think there is none of our per|formers who ought not to be very thankful for a clear benefit of two hundred pounds. This, either of the theatres will afford them at the common prices; and one &s;hould &s;urely imagine that they ought to te&s;tify their acknowledgments for the an|nual company of their friends, rather than make u&s;e of that very e&s;teem which the town entertains for them, to load it with an additional charge&mdash; what they may think of the affair I know not; but of this I am fully per&s;uaded, that the man who would not think him&s;elf highly obliged by a clear benefit of two hundred pounds, never de&s;erves to have a benefit at all.</P>
<P>LET us however examine a little into the general excu&s;e which the gentlemen of the theatres think proper to urge in extenuation of this extraordinary behaviour; whenever they are reprehended on this account their con&s;tant plea is, that they rai&s;e their price in order to oblige their friends, and that as nobody is forced to come, nobody can complain of an injury. This excu&s;e &s;carcely merits a re|ply; yet let me a&s;k the people who urge it, whether the theatre is not entirely a public entertainment;
<PB N="247" REF="256">
and whether they can properly di&s;po&s;e of tho&s;e places to any particular individuals, which are equally appointed for the indifferent reception of all &mdash; Cu&s;tom has for a long time authorized the letting of places in the boxes; but cu&s;tom has never authorized an addition to the regular price &mdash; Why therefore the frequenters of the Pitt &s;hould be excluded from their u&s;ual &s;eats without the payment of two &s;hillings extraordinary is a circum|&s;tance which &s;urpri&s;es me much. What have the Pitt part of the audience done that they &s;hould be &s;ingled out to bear the impo&s;ition of &s;ome arrogant favourite, whom they them&s;elves have probably rai&s;ed into reputation? If an addition mu&s;t be made to the price of tickets on benefit nights; let the tax become general; let the Boxes and the Galle|ries come in for their portion of the burden, and let not the people of the Pitt be the only per&s;on de&s;tined to bear the &s;courge of theatrical avarice and temerity &mdash; If an actor's friends want to put a &s;um of money in his pocket, let them give double or treble the value for their own tickets; but let not the indifferent part of the public be obliged to pay for friend&s;hips in which they have no manner of connexion. The buildings which formerly di&s;|graced the &s;tage on benefit nights have been judi|ciou&s;ly removed by the good-&s;en&s;e of the managers; it is therefore to be hoped that they will &s;hew as much readine&s;s in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a palpable in|ju&s;tice as in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a mere inconveni|ence; and that they will not &s;uffer their performers
<PB N="248" REF="257">
to take a liberty with the public, which they dare not take them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing which I &s;hall recommend to the managers, is to con&s;ult the propriety of places, and to pay a little attention to the rank of their characters. &mdash; What bu&s;ine&s;s has a party of the Engli&s;h foot guards to attend upon a Per&s;ian em|peror? Or is it a rea&s;on that a prince &s;hould not be habited like a prince, becau&s;e the actor who appears in the character has but thirty &s;hillings a week: &mdash; It is inconceivable how the&s;e little things affect an accurate ob&s;erver &mdash; who can bear to &s;ee the duke of Cornwall's gentleman dre&s;t better than the duke of Cornwall him&s;elf &mdash; or endure with patience to &s;ee the per&s;ons of one &s;ingle family dre&s;t in the manner of half a dozen different coun|tries? The probability of the fiction becomes de|&s;troyed by means of the&s;e &s;lovenly inattentions, and Drury-lane or Covent-garden, &s;tare us conti|nually in the face, when we want to be in Spain or in France, in Italy or Illyria.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is a &s;et of good-natured people in the world, who &s;o far from rejoicing at the pro&s;perity of their neighbours, are continually mor|tified whenever they &s;ee others growing up happily
<PB N="249" REF="258">
into life, and encrea&s;ing in their circum&s;tances either by the force of their own indu&s;try, or &s;ome unexpected turn of good fortune.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Mr. Babler, that I was lately a &s;hop-keeper in the Strand, and though I &s;ay it my&s;elf, was as pains-taking a young fellow as mo&s;t are; being a&s;&s;iduous in my duty, I was &s;uc|ce&s;sful in my trade, and would in all probability have &s;oon acquired a comfortable independence, had not the will of a generous relation rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to labour any longer, by bequeathing me a fortune of full twelve hundred a year. On this acqui&s;ition I made over my &s;hop to a worthy young fellow of my own family, and began to &s;hew away a little &s;martly, natu|rally &s;uppo&s;ing that as I was now a man of for|tune, there could be no impropriety what&s;oever in a&s;&s;uming the appearance of a gentleman; more e&s;pecially too, as my education had been tollerably genteel, and my friends were of no little con&s;ide|ration in the country. Yet unhappily, Sir, though I &s;hook my old acquaintance with as much cor|diality by the hand as ever, and was as ready as ever to pa&s;s an evening with them at the Crown and Anchor, neverthele&s;s the pre&s;umption of &s;etting up a carriage, and the vanity of wearing a bit of lace upon my coat, were inexhau&s;tible &s;ources of ridicule. It was expected that I &s;hould be &s;till the very &s;elf &s;ame haberda&s;her I originally &s;et out in life; and in&s;tead of acting in the character I was now entitled to put on, it was thought inconceiva|bly
<PB N="250" REF="259">arrogant that I deviated in the lea&s;t from the &s;implicity of my mechanical appearance. Hence a thou&s;and &s;arca&s;ms of underbred &s;martne&s;s were continually &s;purted at me; and &s;o far from gaining any little credit from the pre&s;ervation of my former affability, that very affability was a&s;cribed to &s;ome motives of affectation, and only &s;erved to plunge me in additional contempt.</P>
<P>WEARIED out with the malevolent reflexions of the town, I determined at la&s;t to retire into Nottingham&s;hire, where my property principally lay, in hopes that a new &s;et of acquaintance would treat me in a very different manner; and that &s;o long as I behaved like a gentleman, I &s;hould at lea&s;t be entitled to good manners and civility. But alas, Sir, here I found, if po&s;&s;ible, fre&s;h cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s and mortification. My profe&s;&s;ion had been noi&s;ed through the whole neighbourhood; and the gentlemen of fortune found it utterly be|low the con&s;equence of their characters to a&s;&s;ociate with a de&s;picable fellow who had formerly been a trade&s;man; when I went down therefore, they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to avoid the mo&s;t di&s;tant in|tercour&s;e with me. In&s;tead of vi&s;iting me as a &s;tranger, they even returned my cards of invita|tion; and one worthy wight in particular, the grand&s;on of a chee&s;e-monger, threatened to hor&s;e|whip my &s;ervant, if he ever more pre&s;umed to come again, on &s;uch a me&s;&s;age from a pitiful little &s;hop|keeper. What to do, Mr. Babler, I knew not: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good e&s;tate I could not herd with the
<PB N="251" REF="260">
very plebeians of the country; and tho&s;e with whom I thought my&s;elf entitled to rank, di&s;dained to keep me company. Thus circum&s;tanced I was obliged to return to the metropolis which had u&s;ed me with &s;o unremitting a degree of ill-nature, and forced to tru&s;t to the ca&s;ual acquaintance of the play or the coffee-hou&s;e, rather than detach my&s;elf entirely from &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE old adage, Mr. Babler, is a very good one, which &s;ays, <Q>Con&s;ider what I <HI>am,</HI> not what I <HI>have</HI> been.</Q> If mankind were in general to be e&s;timated by their original &s;ituations in life, we &s;hould find but very few of our mo&s;t dignified characters entitled to re&s;pect; the bi&s;hop that pro|nounces the benediction in our churches would be found &s;ome incon&s;iderable little chaplain. The chancellor, who like another Deity, directs in all matters of equity, would come out perhaps an ob&s;cure chamber-council; and the mini&s;ter who made both bi&s;hop and chancellor; appear no more at his fir&s;t &s;etting out than a paltry cornet of hor&s;e; yet &s;urely upon their advancement in the word, it would be quite wrong were they to crawl in the contracted circumference of their primeval circles. It would be ridiculous for the fir&s;t to &s;pend his evenings continually at the Chapter coffee-hou&s;e; idle in the &s;econd to pa&s;s away his lei&s;ure at the Grecian; and as improper for the third to be perpetually lounging at George's. If therefore tho&s;e who appear in the mo&s;t elevated characters
<PB N="252" REF="261">
are to act con&s;i&s;tently with what they <HI>are,</HI> and not in conformity to what they <HI>have</HI> been, it cannot &s;urely be improper for tho&s;e who move in a more &s;ubordinate &s;phere to follow the &s;ame example. A man, while he continues in trade, &s;hould appear like a trade&s;man; but if by any accident he &s;hould arrive at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a plentiful e&s;tate, is it not as requi&s;ite that he &s;hould appear like a man of fortune? Upon all occa&s;ions is it not nece&s;&s;ary to act with a charactere&s;tic degree of propriety? Pro|priety, in fact, is con&s;tituted by the ob&s;ervance of character; and con&s;equently he that acts agreeable to the rules of propriety, is infinitely le&s;s intitled to the general ridicule, than he who is terrified by the thing which he formerly has been from a&s;&s;uming the con&s;equence really belonging to what he is. If you approve the&s;e &s;entiments, Mr. Babler, you will kindly give them a place; if not, they &s;hall be &s;ent for in a few days.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG all the extraordinary characters in the exten&s;ive rounds of infamy, who are en|titled to the dete&s;tation of the public, I know of
<PB N="253" REF="262">
none more odious than tho&s;e who depend upon the bounty of &s;ome pro&s;titute for a maintenance, and live upon the wages which &s;ome mi&s;erable woman earns by the mo&s;t abandoned &s;acrifice both of her peace and her reputation. Yet that there are men &s;o callous to every dictate of delicacy, &s;o dead to every &s;entiment of &s;hame, as to boa&s;t of &s;uch a &s;upport; and even make an ab&s;olute pro|fe&s;&s;ion of living by the profligacy of the other &s;ex, experience every day mu&s;t fatally convince the &s;en&s;ible ob&s;erver: let tho&s;e, however, who doubt the truth of the remark, ca&s;t an eye over the following little portrait, and every ninety-nine readers in a hundred will immediately point out the per&s;on from whom I have taken the re&s;em|blance.</P>
<P>CODRAX was born of very ob&s;cure parents in Shrop&s;hire, and had little obligations either to nature or education, but the advantages of a tolerable per&s;on and an impudence unparalleled. Being &s;ent into the world at a very early age with little other dependance than the&s;e two qualificati|ons, he &s;trove upon all occa&s;ions to make them an&s;wer &s;ome account. Hence, wherever he went, he was a man of profe&s;&s;ed gallantry; yet having no pa&s;&s;ions to gratify be&s;ides the de&s;picable avarice of his temper, his attacks were con&s;tantly directed again&s;t tho&s;e who were likely to &s;upply him with money, the moment be obtained any place in their affections. Ignorant as he was of every thing el&s;e, he knew that a woman who parts with her heart
<PB N="254" REF="263">
would be ea&s;ily led to a &s;acrifice of her intere&s;t, and therefore made u&s;e of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;port to the pur&s;e which gave him fir&s;t of all an admittance to the per&s;on.</P>
<P>AMONG the number of tho&s;e who di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him by particular marks of liberality, the mi&s;tre&s;s of a certain noble Lord, who was her&s;elf allowed an ample income by the munificence of her lover, made him an appointment out of her &s;alary of four hundred pounds a year; furni&s;hed an elegant hou&s;e for his convenience, and even &s;et up an equipage to gratify his vanity. It is the con&s;tant cur&s;e of keepers to be di&s;regarded by tho&s;e wretches on whom they are mo&s;t lavi&s;h of their bounty; and it is as con&s;tantly the cur&s;e of the mi&s;erable wretches them&s;elves, to &s;quander away what is thus obtained from the object of their aver&s;ion, on ra&s;cals who treat them with cruelty or contempt. This was the ca&s;e of the unfortu|nate woman before us. Every &s;ixpence which her artifice &s;tole from the mi&s;guided partiality of her Lord, &s;he immediately gave into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Codrax, and thought her&s;elf amply rewarded if he even conde&s;cended to receive the&s;e in&s;tances of her regard with any tolerable &s;hare of civility. Her fondne&s;s, however, was too palpable to be always concealed; her Lord found out her attach|ment, and di&s;carded her with the obloquy &s;he merited. She, however, had &s;till &s;ome jewels; and other valuable moveables. The&s;e &s;he parted with gradually to &s;upport the prodigality of her
<PB N="255" REF="264">
infamous paramour, and at la&s;t reduced her&s;elf to a &s;ingle change of clothes.&mdash;Finding there was no pro&s;pect of benefiting any farther by her weak|ne&s;s. Codrax decamped without beat of drum, and left her to all the &s;tings of pinching poverty and a di&s;pairing love. In this &s;ituation the keen|ne&s;s of her &s;ufferings found a refuge in di&s;traction; and a cell in Bedlam is now the retreat of an un|happy wretch, who &s;ome time ago could wa&s;te no le&s;s than thou&s;ands in the pur&s;uit of her licen|tious di&s;&s;ipations. In the mid&s;t of all her di&s;tre&s;&s;es Codrax, though opulent through the means of her very affection for him, refu&s;ed to give her a &s;hilling; he &s;aw her for &s;ome time wandering na|ked through the &s;treets, bereft alike of habita|tion and bread, yet &s;till be denied the &s;malle&s;t relief. But who could expect a dawn of huma|nity in a bo&s;om which was totally lo&s;t to honour; or think that a mind could be tinctured with the minute&s;t touches of benevolence, which could be|come &s;candalou&s;ly dependant even upon infamy for a &s;upport, and &s;toop to be a pro&s;titute to actual pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>ONE of the next &s;trokes in the character of Codrax, is the de&s;truction of a whole family in the country. Having, in con&s;equence of his la&s;t connection, now got a hand&s;ome &s;um in his pocket, he went down to a certain country town in an elegant chariot, attended by a couple of &s;ervants, and took lodgings ju&s;t by the hou&s;e of a widow lady, who had been left by the ridiculous partiality
<PB N="256" REF="265">
of a doating hu&s;band, the &s;ole care of two chil|dren, one a daughter quite marriageable; and what was &s;till wor&s;e, the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their father's e&s;tate, which amounted to five hundred pounds a year. Our hero's appearance was &s;mart, and his per&s;on, as I have before ob&s;erved, agreeable; he therefore ea&s;ily got him&s;elf introduced to the old matron's hou&s;e, and made &s;uch good u&s;e of his time, that in le&s;s than a fortnight, both mother and daughter were entirely at his devotion: he conti|nued this hopeful connection with the two, till he had either &s;quandered away or engro&s;&s;ed the principal part of their fortune into his hands: He then took his leave triumphantly of the family; the female part of which did not long &s;urvive his departure. The mother died of a broken heart, in all the mi&s;eries, as I hear, of a pari&s;h work|hou&s;e; and the daughter peri&s;hed in childbed for want of common nece&s;&s;aries. What became of the &s;on I know not, but I think &s;omebody told me that he is now either a common &s;eaman in our fleets, or a common &s;oldier in our armies.</P>
<P>CODRAX is now leagued with a profligate performer in the &s;ervice of the public, who has a con&s;iderable &s;um of money and &s;ome valuable jewels in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He has for &s;ome time a&s;&s;umed the title of knighthood; and ordered in a variety of articles from various trade&s;men, who have not yet perhaps repented of their credulity. How long this connection may continue, is a mat|ter of little con&s;equence to the world. Tho&s;e,
<PB N="257" REF="266">
however, who &s;ee this, may be warned by the advice of a friend, and take care how they admit &s;uch a man into their families.

<P>IN one of my papers, &s;ome time ago, I threw out a hint relative to a pa&s;&s;ion, which my young rogue Harry had conceived for Mi&s;s Cornelia Marchmont, whom I mentioned as the very ab|&s;tract of every mental perfection, and every per&s;onal accompli&s;hment; my conjecture for a con&s;iderable while was acquiring fre&s;h foundation, but as my nephew &s;aid nothing of the matter to me, I took no notice of it to him, though I could not help &s;miling at the belief, which he entertained, that I was totally ignorant in regard to the object of his affections&mdash;La&s;t monday &s;evennight however, he came to me with an air of the greate&s;t tran&s;port, and after apologizing for not having made me acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s a little &s;ooner, inform|ed me, that Mi&s;s Marchmont had ble&s;t him that morning with the acknowledgment of a reciprocal e&s;teem, and that I was the per&s;on whom &s;he had pitched upon to open a negotiation between the two families.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="267">AS I do not know any young lady exi&s;ting, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a greater &s;hare of my e&s;teem, than Mi&s;s Marchmont; nor ever &s;aw a per&s;on &s;o immediately calculated to make my boy happy, I &s;hook him cordially by the hand, wi&s;hed him joy from the bottom of my heart, and in&s;tantly &s;et out to my &s;i&s;ter Rattle, who is a very worthy woman, though &s;he &s;ometimes will argue with me about a point of philo&s;ophy; and is a very &s;en&s;ible one too, though &s;he has within the&s;e three months found fault with one or two of my Bablers: &mdash; Luckily on my en|trance, I found Mr. Marchmont, Cornelia's father, chatting with her at the parlour fire, and as he and I have been intimately acquainted above thirty years, I opened the bu&s;ine&s;s of my errand without any ce|remony, and this the more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e I knew neither could have any rea&s;onable objection to the match; every thing turned out as I expected, both were rejoiced at the affection between the young people; and there being no mighty mat|ters of law to retard the celebration of the nuptials, I thought it be&s;t to make &s;hort work of the affair, and accordingly fixed the wedding for the follow|ing Saturday. The propo&s;ition being approved by the parent of each, I retired to make Harry happy with the intelligence, and in pur&s;uance of the agreement I &s;aw him ble&s;t with one of the worthie&s;t, as well as &s;weete&s;t girls in the univer&s;e, with ten thou&s;and pounds in her pocket la&s;t Satur|day morning; &mdash; Harry has fifteen hundred a year
<PB N="259" REF="268">
him&s;elf, and my &s;i&s;ter who has a very good join|ture, is I fancy making a pur&s;e for him into the bargain; &mdash; &s;o that between what he mu&s;t have upon her decea&s;e; and upon the decea&s;e of ano|ther per&s;on who &s;hall be namele&s;s &mdash; there will be ample provi&s;ion for a ri&s;ing family.</P>
<P>AS I look upon a wedding-day, to be one of the mo&s;t important calls which either of the &s;exes have in their whole lives, for the exertion of an extraordinary delicacy I was not a little attentive to the behaviour of my two favourites, and it gave me infinite plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve upon the whole, that Harry's behaviour was manly, tender and re&s;pectful, without deviating into that ful&s;ome di&s;agraeable fondne&s;s; of which, even men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e are often guilty, when they have ju&s;t obtained the wo|man of their heart: As to Cornelia, I never &s;aw a young creature in her &s;ituation, conduct her&s;elf with more propriety &mdash; to all the dignity of con&s;cious virtue, &s;he joined all the ineffable &s;weetne&s;s of an engaging timidity; and though &s;he &s;eemed proud of the man whom &s;he had thus preferred to all the world, yet &s;he had too much &s;en&s;ibility not to feel &s;ome amiable terrors, at &s;o awful an alteration of her circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>AFTER the performance of the ceremony we all retired to Mr. Marchmont's, and there being a large company of us, Harry judiciou&s;ly propo&s;ed an unremitting round of amu&s;ements both before din|ner and after, which entirely employed the atten|tion even of the mo&s;t volatile, and prevented the
<PB N="260" REF="269">
circulation of tho&s;e indelicate ambiguities with which the generality of wedding-days are frequent|ly di&s;graced.

<P>I HAVE been often &s;hocked at the &s;olemnization of a marriage, to &s;ee the ridiculous, I had almo&s;t &s;aid the profligate, levity with which people have approached the altar of the divine being, and je&s;ted with one another at the in&s;tant of &s;upplicating a ble&s;&s;ing from his hand: nay I have been many times pre&s;ent where the clergyman who read the &s;ervice has con&s;idered the affair as a matter of the greate&s;t merriment, and even winked with a pecu|liar degree of archne&s;s at the bride, when he came to mention the procreation of children.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine on a wedding day, that, if the friends of the married couple had even no vene|ration for the Deity, they would at lea&s;t have &s;ome little &s;hare of politene&s;s; and be actuated by a ten|der concern for the feelings of the lady, if they even felt no awe what&s;oever in the pre&s;ence of their God. A woman of any &s;en&s;ibility on her wed|ding-day, mu&s;t naturally be in circum&s;tances &s;uf|ficiently embarra&s;&s;ed, without hearing any illiberal plea&s;antries from the company, to enhance the difficulties of her &s;ituation. When &s;he con&s;iders that the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of her life materially depends upon the choice which &s;he has then made,
<PB N="261" REF="270">
&s;he has cau&s;e enough for terror: and when &s;he con&s;iders the privilege which is &s;hortly to be claimed by the object of that choice, when &s;he con|&s;iders that the delicate re&s;erve, in which &s;he has all her life been brought up, is in an in&s;tant to be &s;acri|ficed to his inclination; I &s;ay, when all the&s;e things are con&s;idered, nothing can be more in&s;olent or indeed more cruel than to aggravate her di|&s;tre&s;s, by the practice of any improper jocularities. People I am &s;en&s;ible are &s;trangely attached to old cu&s;toms, but every cu&s;tom &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, which is in the lea&s;t repugnant to rea&s;on and civi|lity; on which account, I flatter my&s;elf the reader will give a proper attention to this &s;ubject, and cor|rect the error I have here been &s;peaking of as far as he is able, in the circuit of his acquaintance.</P>

<P>DURING the time of the celebrated Thamas Kouli Kahn, it was a common amu&s;ement with him and his officers, to take a number of a&s;&s;es, and try who could make the deepe&s;t inci|&s;ion, in the backs of tho&s;e unfortunate animals with a &s;abre; he that cut farthe&s;t was allow|ed the reputation of the &s;tronge&s;t man; and frequently it happened, that one of the mi&s;er|able creatures was entirely divided a&s;under by the force of a &s;ingle &s;troke: this anecdote was men|tioned at a club, to which I have the honour
<PB N="262" REF="271">
of belonging, by a gentleman of unque&s;tionable veracity and good &s;en&s;e, who was many years a re&s;ident in Per&s;ia, and was an occa&s;ional &s;pectator at &s;everal of the&s;e inhuman diver&s;ions; the whole company to their honour, it mu&s;t be mentioned, expre&s;&s;ed an hone&s;t abhorrence at &s;uch barbarous relaxations, and we all congratulated our&s;elves upon living in a country, where it would be &s;can|dalous, for the very fir&s;t orders to imitate the Per&s;ian hero in his brutal exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN I got home, however, I could not help reflecting, that notwith&s;tanding the con&s;cious pride of heart, which we all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the moment of &s;elf-congratulation, a number of amu&s;ements could be pointed out in this kingdom con&s;iderably more barbarous, than the practice of hewing an a&s;s to pieces, though this appeared &s;o ju&s;tly &s;hocking to our imaginations: nay, what is &s;till wor&s;e, the enjoyment of &s;everal barbarities is particularly re|&s;erved for people of the fir&s;t figure and under|&s;tanding, as if tho&s;e, who&s;e feeling &s;hould be un|commonly tender, had an additional title to the commi&s;&s;ion of cruelties; and as if a violent outrage upon every &s;entiment of humanity, &s;hould be the peculiar privilege of birth and fortune:&mdash;My readers may be &s;urpri&s;ed at this ob&s;ervation, upon the peo|ple of England; yet let me a&s;k if it be more cruel to torture an a&s;s, than to torture a &s;tag; or whe|ther it is not even more compa&s;&s;ionate to di&s;patch the fir&s;t at a blow, than to pur&s;ue the latter for a number of hours, encrea&s;ing the wretched animal's

agony at every &s;tep, and yielding it up at la&s;t, to a death that mu&s;t harrow up the bo&s;om of any good natured man, who allows him&s;elf a moment's &s;pace for reflexion.</P>
<P>THE more in reality that we con&s;ider this point, the more we &s;hall find it nece&s;&s;ary, to condemn the inhabitants of this civilized, this benevolent, country; the Per&s;ian when he di&s;patches the unfor|tunate a&s;s, commits no tre&s;pa&s;s upon the property of his neighbour, nor manife&s;ts any di&s;regard to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a friend: the animal whom he de|&s;troys is his own, it is confined to a particular &s;pot: and nobody can &s;uffer in it's death but him&s;elf; whereas in the pro&s;ecution of the chace with us, we trample incon&s;iderately through half a county, perhaps, over the corn grounds and inclo&s;ures, which the indu&s;trious farmer has cultivated, or planted, at a very great expence; and if the per|&s;on whom we thus injure expre&s;&s;es any re&s;entment at our conduct, we po&s;&s;ibly hor&s;ewhip him for his in&s;olence, and &s;end him home with the reparation of a bleeding head, to comfort his wife and chil|dren. This is not all, in the phrenzy of a hunting match, as well as being &s;en&s;ible to the wrongs which we offer to others, we become wholly un|mindful of the prejudice, which we do our&s;elves; for let our lives be of never &s;uch con&s;equence to our families, we become regardle&s;s of danger; we never he&s;itate at leaps that are manife&s;tly big with de&s;truction; and even, if the brother of our brea&s;t, &s;hould meet with any accident in this mad-headed
<PB N="264" REF="273">
cour&s;e, &s;o far from &s;topping to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, we make an ab&s;olute je&s;t of his misfortune, and expre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure in proportion as we find him in|volved in di&s;tre&s;s; if he di&s;locates a leg or an arm by a fall from his hor&s;e, he affords us an exqui&s;ite entertainment; but, if he actually fractures his &s;kull, our mirth becomes extravagant, and we con|tinue wild with delight, till happine&s;s is totally effaced by intoxication.</P>
<P>THE civilized nations of Europe, are extremely ready upon all occa&s;ions, to &s;tigmatize every other part of the world with the epithet of barbarians, though the appellation might with infinitely more propriety be conferred upon them&s;elves; among the polite&s;t of our neighbours, there are a thou&s;and cu&s;toms kept up, which would fill the mo&s;t unculti|vated &s;avage with horror, and give him if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;till more contemptible idea of chri&s;tianity; an Indian Brachmin, for in&s;tance, will frequently go to the &s;ea-&s;ide, while the fi&s;hermen are drawing their nets, and purcha&s;e a whole boat full of fi&s;h for the humane &s;atisfaction of re&s;toring the expiring creatures to their natural element, and &s;natching them from death; &mdash; nay, the tenderne&s;s of the Brachmins is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, with regard to the ani|mal creation, that they have been known to pur|cha&s;e cattle at an extraordinary price, merely to &s;ave them from &s;laughter; compa&s;&s;ionately think|ing, the lowing heifer, or the bleating lamb, an equal, though an humbler heir of exi&s;tence, with them&s;elves: what then, would men of this exalted

benevolence, think of the Briti&s;h nation, were they to &s;ee with what &s;olemnity the right of murdering an innocent Partridge, or a harmle&s;s Hare, is &s;ettled by the legi&s;lative power of the kingdom? Were they to &s;ee the armies, which at particular &s;ea&s;ons, i&s;&s;ue forth, to de&s;troy the warbling inhabitants of air, for actual diver&s;ion; the &s;portive tenants of the river for idle recreation? But above all, what would they feel to &s;ee a generous dome&s;tic little bird, &s;candalou&s;ly tied to the &s;take, and denied the &s;malle&s;t chance of life, at the eve of a &s;acred-fa&s;t, &s;et apart by our holy religion, for the purpo&s;es of extraordinary &s;anctity, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of unu&s;ual mortification; &mdash; it is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine what they would feel, when there are even Chri&s;tians to be found, who cannot &s;ee the practice without horror, nor think of it without tears.</P>
<P>I AM far from carrying my notions of tenderne&s;s to the animal creation, beyond the bounds of rea|&s;on, as the Brachmins do, who think it irreligious to feed upon any thing which has been ever endued with life; becau&s;e I believe, the great Author of all things, de&s;igned the&s;e animals principally for the u&s;e and &s;u&s;tenance of man: yet at the &s;ame time, that I &s;uppo&s;e they were formed by the Deity for the relief of our nece&s;&s;ities, I cannot imagine he ever intended, they &s;hould be tortured through wantonne&s;s, or de&s;troyed for diver&s;ion; nor can I imagine, but what even the &s;uper&s;titious forbearance of the Brachmins, is infinitely more plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, than the incon&s;iderate cruelty of tho&s;e who
<PB N="266" REF="275">
profe&s;s an immediate obedience to his word: a God All-mercy, never takes delight in the unnece&s;&s;ary agony of a creature, whom he has been plea&s;ed to endue with exi&s;tence; we therefore offer an in&s;ult to him, when we give a needle&s;s pang to the mean|e&s;t of his creatures, and ab&s;olutely pervert the de|&s;ign of his Providence, whenever we &s;acrifice tho&s;e animals to our amu&s;ements, which he has con&s;ti|tuted entirely for the relief of our wants.</P>
<P>I HAVE thrown out the&s;e reflexions with a bene|volent purpo&s;e, as &s;uch numbers of the ignorant and the thoughtle&s;s, are apt to promote their amu&s;e|ments at the expence of their humanity; &s;hould, what I have here offered, be attended with the refor|mation but of an individual, I &s;hall think my time well employed; ridicule I mu&s;t naturally expect from numbers, for daring to combat with favourite preju|dices; but it is my con&s;olation, that no wittici&s;m whatever, which may be aimed at me as a writer, can, on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of animadver&s;ion, do me the minute&s;t injury as a man.</P>

<P>WE are told by Plutarch, that whenever the celebrated Phocion &s;tood up in the &s;enate to &s;peak upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, De|mo&s;thenes, who generally e&s;pou&s;ed a different &s;y&s;tem of politics, would whi&s;per the per&s;on who &s;at next
<PB N="267" REF="276">
him, and &s;ay, <HI>here comes the pruning book of my pe|riods.</HI> For my own part, greatly as I my&s;elf may fall under the common cen&s;ure with the generality of my brother &s;criblers, I could neverthele&s;s wi&s;h that the pre&s;ent age had &s;ome &s;alutary pruning hook, to lop off the redundancies of expre&s;&s;ion in literary compo&s;ition; that the reader might not be put to the trouble of going over an unnece&s;&s;ary number of words, which, in&s;tead of helping out a writer's &s;en&s;e, mo&s;t commonly have quite a con|trary effect, and only &s;erve to ob&s;cure the tendency of his arguments.</P>
<P>IN the Pro&s;aic productions of the pre&s;s, our modern writers, in&s;tead of aiming at conci&s;ene&s;s and per&s;picuity, are too apt to &s;tudy what is called, a <HI>rotundity</HI> of period; and too ready to tre&s;pa&s;s upon propriety, for the mere con&s;ideration of em|belli&s;hment; thus to make a &s;entence roll floridly on the ear, they often run into the mo&s;t tedious repetitions; and u&s;e double the requi&s;ite quantity of words from an unaccountable &s;uppo&s;ition, that an elegance of &s;tile is con&s;tituted by an ab&s;olute prolixity: whereas a moment's recollection mu&s;t &s;atisfy a &s;en&s;ible mind, that the &s;ooner we di&s;cover our meanings, the more ma&s;terly our pens mu&s;t be naturally e&s;teemed; and the &s;ooner we inform the under&s;tanding of a reader, the more capable we are to an&s;wer the important de&s;igns of his in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>IN poetical compo&s;ition there is nothing more frequent than the practice of clogging a line with
<PB N="268" REF="277">
a load of u&s;ele&s;s epithet or unmeaning pleona&s;m, merely to fill out the nece&s;&s;ary quantity of &s;yllables: to point out what I mean more &s;trongly, I &s;hall give the reader an example from a man of no le&s;s con&s;equence than Addi&s;on. The following ill-written &s;imile in Cato has been greatly admired, and even in the Guardian it is quoted as one of the principal beauties which excites the admiration of lady Lizard and her family:
<Q><L>So the <HI>pure limpid</HI> &s;tream when <HI>foul'd</HI> with <HI>&s;tains,</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>gu&s;hing torrents</HI> and <HI>de&s;cending rains,</HI></L>
<L>Works it&s;elf clear and as it runs refines,</L>
<L>Till by degrees the floating mirror &s;hines:</L>
<L>Reflect each flow'r that on the border grows,</L>
<L>And a new heaven in it's fair bo&s;om &s;hews.</L></Q>
In the four fir&s;t lines of this &s;imile the judicious reader will immediately perceive, that the poet has done little more than called a &s;pade a &s;pade; that is, made u&s;e of &s;ynonimous epithets or meanings entirely &s;imilar; the epithet <HI>pure</HI> is ju&s;t the &s;ame as <HI>limpid</HI>; and we all know that when a &s;tream is <HI>fouled,</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;tained</HI> of cour&s;e: in like man|ner <HI>to work it&s;elf clear, it mu&s;t refine as it runs</HI>; and con&s;equently refining only as it runs, it's &s;hining mu&s;t be gradual. To be &s;erious, the poet might as well repeat the term <HI>pure,</HI> as follow it with the term <HI>limpid</HI>; and he might with ju&s;t the &s;ame ele|gance tell us, that the &s;tream wa&s;tained with &s;tains, as u&s;e a word of ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;ignification. Mr. Addi&s;on, however highly entitled to our admi|ration
<PB N="269" REF="278">
as a pro&s;e-writer, has, as a ver&s;ifier, but &s;mall preten&s;ions to our applau&s;e; it is not there|fore &s;o much to cen&s;ure him that I have pointed out the pre&s;ent imperfection, as to warn my poe|tical purcha&s;ers from copying the mi&s;take. In poetry our epithets &s;hould never be forced&mdash;pro|perly u&s;ed they have a fine effect; but when they are vi&s;ibly dragged in to &s;pin out the mea&s;ure of a line, and are moreover bald repetitions of the &s;ame idea, they become abominable. Nothing contributes more to their beauty than variety; and nothing is ea&s;ier than to render them various. A &s;tream, for in&s;tance, has more qualities than one; it may be &s;mooth as well as limpid; and a ro&s;e be&s;ides it's colour, has fragrance to di&s;tingui&s;h it. When, therefore, our objects have qualities enough to &s;upply us with a diver&s;ity of epithets, it mu&s;t be a &s;trange forgetfulne&s;s indeed to pick out a &s;ynonim, and to tell the world that what is ex|cellent is excellent.</P>
<P>THE great art of all &s;tile is for a writer never to throw away his words; never to introduce any thing into his piece but what is really nece&s;|&s;ary for the main purpo&s;e of his de&s;ign. It is not becau&s;e he has a pompous period of pro&s;e to di&s;play, or has a mind to parade with a particular blaze of poetical fancy, that he &s;hould overleap the bounds of propriety; no compo&s;ition can have merit but in proportion as it is founded upon good &s;en&s;e; and good &s;en&s;e mu&s;t always feel an injury where a &s;tab is directed at propriety. For the&s;e
<PB N="270" REF="279">
rea&s;ons an author &s;hould always aim at &s;aying pertinent things, in preference to fine ones; and when his partiality for &s;ome new &s;entiment is run|ning away with his judgment, he ought to con&s;ider that the eye of the world is much more inclined to kindle with di&s;dain, than to &s;parkle with admi|ration; he ought to con&s;ider that an indifferent reader may look with the greate&s;t contempt upon the very pa&s;&s;age which he him&s;elf views with &s;o exqui&s;ite a degree of &s;atisfaction; and he ought al&s;o to con&s;ider, that the noble&s;t flight of genius improperly brought in, is at be&s;t but a &s;hining ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons therefore, when a writer &s;its down to work upon a &s;ubject which he imagines of con&s;equence to mankind, let him by all means prefer the &s;ub&s;tantial advantages of intrin&s;ic u&s;e, to the flim&s;ey fripperies of out&s;ide ornament; let him endeavour to be clear before he &s;trives to be florid; and let him, where he aims at a floridity of &s;tile, take care that he is not in danger of &s;triking on the quick&s;ands of a dull repetition, or a lifele&s;s prolixity. Stile is but a very in&s;ignificant circum&s;tance, unle&s;s it has actual matter to embelli&s;h; and it mu&s;t ren|der a man truly ridiculous indeed, who takes a world of pains in the formation of a &s;entence, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable end. Upon the whole, if we cannot attain a &s;tile in literary compo&s;ition without tediou&s;ne&s;s or tau|toligy; if we are forced to load every period with an unnece&s;&s;ary weight of words, merely to give
<PB N="271" REF="280">
our &s;entiments a little air of &s;moothne&s;s and order, I think it would in general be advi&s;eable if we avoided an acquaintance with pen and ink; though at any rate a plain little frock will become us infi|nitely better than a tawdry fanta&s;tic coat covered entirely with tin&s;el, and marking us out to the world as a ridiculous compound of affectation and inability.</P>

<P>THERE is &s;carcely a walk of literature, which is reckoned &s;o ea&s;y, or which in fact is &s;o difficult as this &s;pecies of periodical publication; in every other &s;tile of compo&s;ition, a writer may di&s;play his abi|lities on that particular &s;ubject with which he is mo&s;t intimately acquainted; and may rai&s;e a con|&s;iderable &s;hare of character by expatiating on &s;uch topics as are mo&s;t immediately agreeable to his imagination; be&s;ides this, he may allow him&s;elf what time he thinks proper for the perfection of his works; and is never confined by a want of room from delivering him&s;elf fully upon the mi|nute&s;t point of &s;peculation: but the ca&s;e is far other wi&s;e with the unfortunate E&s;&s;ayi&s;t: the mi&s;cel|laneous nature of his undertaking, forces him to furni&s;h a variety of &s;ubjects, and obliges him to enter upon numberle&s;s di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, which require not only a general knowledge of the world, but are often repugnant to his inclination: nor do the in|conveniencies under which he labours re&s;t here; under an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of publi&s;hing on a

<P>I DO not mention the&s;e matters by any means to enhance the merit of my performance, but to apo|logize in reality for it's faults; a reader who does not con&s;ider how an E&s;&s;ayi&s;t is circum&s;tanced, will often have opportunity to animadvert upon his pro|ductions with the greate&s;t &s;everity; he will find many &s;ubjects handled with little knowledge and others di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with le&s;s force; his good nature mu&s;t therefore mitigate the har&s;hne&s;s of his criti|ci&s;m, and he mu&s;t never pronounce upon the work without con&s;idering the &s;ituation of the Author.
