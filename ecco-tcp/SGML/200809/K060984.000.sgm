<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Confe&s;s, the Occa&s;ions of my appearing in Print again u|pon this Subject, are unexpected; and as the writing a <HI>Fifth E&s;&s;ay</HI> is Contrary to my real De&s;ign, and more &s;o to my Inclination, I cannot but &s;ay &s;omething by way of In|troduction to it.</P>
<P>The Management of this pre&s;ent Treaty, I mean, with|out Doors, has &s;omething in it peculiarly odd, and to me very &s;urprizing; Rea&s;on and Argument, nay even De|mon&s;tration cannot reach it; Men will argue again&s;t, nay Banter, and be Witty upon the &s;everal Branches, &amp; yet at the end of the Di&s;cour&s;e profe&s;s, They do not Under&s;tand them&mdash;They will be &s;ilenc't, and yet not at all Con|vinc't; they wont believe, when they cannot reply; when they own, they gain by it, they are not plea&s;ed; when they fancy, they are Lo&s;ers, they are fond of Complaining; and when they can't make it out, rail on tho&s;e that Endeavour to Confute them.</P>
<P>Words can have no Effect on &s;uch Per&s;ons, no Argument can touch them; either they Can't, or Won't, Under&s;tand any thing but what they like. Bitterne&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es their Souls, and breaks out too much at their Tongues: and I
<PB REF="3">
mu&s;t tell them, I think, I bear more than my Share of this from them too, and that without Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, Gentlemen, that an Attempt calmly to remove Prejudices (and I am &s;ure, I have done it both Calmly and Cautiou&s;ly) &s;hould fill any Body with Prejudices at the Au|thor. <HI>Scotland</HI> has been in &s;ome Reputation for Courte&s;y to Strangers, &amp; I &s;hould be very &s;orry, you &s;hould break in upon that part of your Character, only with a Reconciler. An Attempt to remove Prejudices, can have nothing in it; unle&s;s that the Truths &s;poken, move the Spleen of &s;ome, who would not be reconciled, and therefore cannot bear the Demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P>Nor would I be mi&s;taken here, I am far from being Concern'd at the Ribauldry of the Street, calling my Name about to every Ballad, making me the Author of Pa|pers I never &s;aw; when Gentlemen lampoon one ano|ther, calling it mine, and the like, this is an old Method taken with me, and I am u&s;ed to it.&mdash;<Q><L>My Mu&s;e mu&s;t be the Whore of Poetry,</L>
<L>And all <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Ba&s;tards laid to me.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Gentlemen are wellcome, and the Mob of Writers by all their Wittici&s;ms, &s;hall only provoke me to Silence. I remember, and I wi&s;h, &s;ome other Gentlemen here would take the hint as I do&mdash;My Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> advi&s;ing
<PB REF="4">
My Lord&mdash;not to reply to Satyr and Lampoon, has the&s;e two Merry Lines.<Q><L>Fellows that ne'er were Heard or read of,</L>
<L>If thou writ'&s;t on, will write thy head off.</L></Q></P>
<P>Others, I am told, are furni&s;hing them&s;elves with Scan|dal, and De&s;ign to an&s;wer my Arguments with Per&s;onal Reflection.</P>
<P>I thank GOD, my Life, however mixt with Misfor|tunes, has not been &s;uch, that I am a&s;ham'd to &s;ee it in Print. Nor &s;hall I offer any Capitulations with &s;uch Gentlemen, only intreat them for their own Sakes, to &s;ay nothing but what is true:&mdash;and then to add at the Bottom of their Story, what mighty Signification it has to the Argument in hand.</P>
<P>When our Saviour had healed the Man born blind, and he, appearing before the Elders, an&s;wered them with a Te&s;timony to the Divinity of the Healer, which they could not reply to, <HI>viz.</HI> That he mu&s;t be GOD, &s;ince nothing of a Man could ha' wrought &s;uch a Cure&mdash;To an&s;wer the Conviction of his Rea&s;oning, they fall upon the Poor Man, <HI>Thou wer't altogether born in &s;in and doe&s;t thon teach us&mdash;and they Ca&s;t him Out</HI>&mdash;and yet af|ter all what the Poor Man &s;aid, was very true&mdash;</P>
<P>Now Gentlemen, if what I &s;ay be true, why will you not hear it? if not true, why will ye not an&s;wer it?&mdash;
<PB REF="5">
Let the Author be never &s;o De&s;picable or Mean in your Eyes, he is in no Man's meaner than in his Own: but Truth in the meane&s;t Hand, de&s;erves your Regard; Accept the Truth, and u&s;e the Author as you like, he is perfectly un|concern'd about that.</P>
<P>But all this does not yet reach the Matter which I Com|plain of: But I think it harde&s;t, when Gentlemen, who pre|tend to an&s;wer what pinches them in Fact, Charge me with Fal&s;ities, wrong repre&s;enting things &amp; the like, &amp; to make it out, give their own A&s;&s;ertions only, without the lea&s;t Proof either to make Good their own, or Detect mine.</P>
<P>When Gentlemen reflect on what I have wrote, as not true, and u&s;e me ill on that head, at the &s;ame time contra|dicting it, with nothing but what is manife&s;tly fal&s;e, impo&s;|ing upon the World their own Affirmative without Proof again&s;t Arguments, which are, and can be prov'd by Undoubted and undeniable Authority; this, I mu&s;t own, is u&s;ing a Stranger very ill.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give but two or three In&s;tances of this here, and &s;hall meet with the re&s;t as I go.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Here's a Gentleman tells me in Print, That the &s;mall Beer in <HI>England</HI> does pay more than 1 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 3. <HI>d. per</HI> Bar|rel if &s;old for above 6 <HI>&s;h: per</HI> Barrel; that the Foreign Salt payes 10 <HI>&s;h: per</HI> Bu&s;bel Cu&s;tom, that there are Duties &amp; Re&s;trictions on the Export of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manu|facture and the like. And this the Gentleman calls a Con|futing my Fourth E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
Now as this wants but a &s;hort An&s;wer, &s;o that An|&s;wer will detect the Gentleman's Ignorance <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> his forwardne&s;s of Charging me vvithout Proof.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> pre&s;cribes the Exci&s;e to only tvvo Denominations of Beer, Small and Strong, and that the Small Beer is &s;trictly call'd 6 <HI>&s;h:</HI> Beer: and I &s;uppo&s;e in Charity to him, that he looked no further than the Letter of the Act.</P>
<P>But if he thinks fit to examine the Practice in <HI>England,</HI> and the Nature of the thing, he will find three things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That there is no Small Beer &s;old in <HI>England</HI> at 6 Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Hou&s;hold Beer &s;old in <HI>London,</HI> and Parts adjacent at 10 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Barrel, and &s;ome at 12 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Bar|rel, pays no more Exci&s;e than as Small Beer, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 3 <HI>d. per</HI> Barrel; and of this I can bring him &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es of People of both Nations now here.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That by the Nature of the Act, it can be no otherwi&s;e, &s;ince the Act does not &s;ay, all Beer above 6 &s;s. &s;hall pay as Strong Beer, but the word, Strong Beer, is governed by the U&s;age of Exci&s;e, and is all &s;old as Ale from 18 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Bar|rel to above 40 <HI>&s;h.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If it is <HI>asked</HI> me, Why the Act calls it 6 <HI>&s;h.</HI> Beer? I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> Becau&s;e, that Act having been made above 30 Year ago, the Small Beer in tho&s;e days, was &s;old at that price; and this Exci&s;e being but in two Heads or Denomi|nations
<PB REF="7">
as before, the Term needed no Alteration, tho' the price of Sale was ri&s;en: &s;ince it follow'd by the Name of Small Beer, that nothing could pay as Strong, that had not the fir&s;t Runnings of the Malt.</P>
<P>I need enlarge no further, to prove the ju&s;tice of my Calculation, or the unfairne&s;s of being Charg'd here with Impo&s;ing on the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> Ca&s;e is in the &s;ame Gentleman's Paper, who tells me, the Duty on Foreign Salt is 10 &s;s. <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel; and to in&s;ult me the more, adds, That 'tis <HI>by them that know it as well as I.</HI></P>
<P>Now as this &s;howes the Gentleman's Heat to run before his Di&s;|cretion, I mu&s;t tell him, there can be no ju&s;t Compari&s;on between any Man's Knowledge here, &s;ince the Acts of Parl. are plain, in which the Taxes upon Salt are &s;ettled, and that there may be no Di&s;pute on the Difference of Mea&s;ure, the Bu&s;hel is Determined to weigh 84 <HI>l:</HI> weight <HI>Avoir du pois,</HI> and if he plea&s;es to &s;earch the &s;aid Acts, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Book of Rates, he will find the Duty &s;tands thus. <TABLE>

<P>Either I am Right or wrong: if wrong, let the Acts of Parliament decide that Controver&s;y; if I am Right,&mdash;then this Gentleman and his Author, who, he &s;ays, <HI>knows it as well as I,</HI> have &s;omething more to account for to the world, than an home&s;t Man cares to be charg'd with: and if I had u&s;ed him &s;o, I would frankly ask his Pardon.</P>
<P>As to the Duties and Re&s;trictions on the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>England</HI> on Export, the 36 Minute of Parliament has an&s;wered and confuted it for me,&mdash;I need &s;ay nothing in my own Vindication after &s;uch an Authority, only recommend it to the Gentleman him&s;elf to con&s;ider, whether he has u&s;ed either me or his Country hone&s;tly.</P>

<HEAD>A Fifth ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t E&s;&s;ay, I went thro' a great many Branches of the Popular Objections rai&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> again&s;t the Union.&mdash;I wi&s;h I could exactly di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e that Men rai&s;e only to oppo&s;e the Thing in General, and prevent the Uniting the Nations <HI>on any Terms whatever,</HI> and tho&s;e which are really offered from hone&s;t Scruple at the Particu|lars.</P>
<P>However, whether I can di&s;tingui&s;h them in their Argu|ments, or no; I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h them as well as I can in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, in which I &s;hall have all due regard to hone&s;t Rea&s;oning and fair Argument, but not &s;o much to Cavil and Frivolous or Malicious Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I little thought it had been po&s;&s;ible that any <HI>Scots-man,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;uch as under&s;tand the Affairs here, could &s;ay, That <HI>Scotland</HI> does not gain by <HI>England</HI> in Trade, much le&s;s that you do, or can Trade abroad with equal Advantages to other Nations.</P>
<P>I could not imagine any Man would offer that it is your Ad|vantage to Trade with <HI>France,</HI> where you bring back nothing but what drains you of Money, and &s;end little thither but what you ought to keep at Home.</P>
<P>Le&s;s was it to be expected, that Men &s;hould publi&s;h in Print, that your Trade will be ruin'd by an Union with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9" MS="y">
Wherefore to all the&s;e Heads, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething as plain and Conci&s;e as I can, if po&s;&s;ible, to remove the Prejudices which are form'd in the Heads of the Ignorant, as if on Pur|po&s;e to &s;et them in the light of your future Advantages.</P>
<P>But before I come to this, I mu&s;t &s;ay a Word or two to a mighty Champion, that has undertaken from my own Writ|ing in another Ca&s;e, to overthrow the very Foundation of the pre&s;ent Treaty, and &s;etting <HI>D. F.</HI> again&s;t <HI>D. F.</HI> Demon|&s;trates, as he thinks, that the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> has no Power to enter upon this Treaty, nor go on with it without the Con&s;ent of their Con&s;tituents that Choo&s;e them.</P>
<P>And to do this, he Quotes a long Part of a Book wrote &s;ome time &s;ince in <HI>England,</HI> Entitled, <HI>The Original Right of the Col|lective Body of the People of</HI> England <HI>Vindicated and A&s;&s;erted,</HI> in An&s;wer to Sir <HI>Humphra Mackworth</HI>'s Book, Called, <HI>A Vindi|cation of the Commons of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In this Book I lay down Four Maxims of Government, which this Gentleman Quotes, at large.</P>
<P>Now 'tis &s;o &s;trange a thing, notwith&s;tanding all this, That the&s;e Gentlemen &s;hould bring this Quotation to prove the want of Power in the pre&s;ent Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to en|ter upon the &V;nion, that I mu&s;t own I never &s;aw any thing fetcht &s;o remote in Argument in my Life.</P>
<P>If any Man therefore plea&s;e but to Examine two things, he will &s;ee thro' all this Cloud of Cavil, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;h the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>All that this long Quotation amounts to, is &s;um'd up in this, That ail Government being con&s;tituted for the Publick Good, all the Parts of Government Cea&s;ing to Act for the Publick Good, cea&s;e from the &s;ame Publick Capacity in which they were Con&s;tituted, the end of their Authority being De|&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">
This only then leads us to Examine, whether the pre&s;ent Par|liament of <HI>Scotland</HI> are Acting for the Publick Good, or no, and I &s;hall be very glad to join I&s;&s;ue with any Body on that Head.</P>
<P>The other Ca&s;e quoted, refers to Parliaments <HI>making Laws again&s;t Rea&s;on, Nature, or the Divine Law.</HI>&mdash;And had the Author here quoted me fairly, he would have gone on and &s;how'd an In&s;tance I gave to explain the re&s;t,</P>
<P><HI>Viz. If the People of</HI> England <HI>find their Repre&s;entatives going about to betray the Religion and Liberties of their Country,</HI> what the &s;aid People <HI>by the Laws of Rea&s;on, Nature and Religion ought to do?</HI> And to Illu&s;trate this, I gave In&s;tances of the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> alternately Re-e&s;tabli&s;hing to Day Po|pery, to Morrow the Prote&s;tant Religion; to Day one King, to Morrow another; to Day declaring Queen <HI>Mary</HI> Legiti|mate, and Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> a Ba&s;tard; to Morrow Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> a Legitimate, and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> a Ba&s;tard; and from thence I argued to the Subver&s;ion of Ju&s;tice and Corruption of the Laws in the&s;e Ca&s;es; I think all I have advanced there very Ju&s;t and Plain, and I never yet heard it objected again&s;t.</P>
<P>But with Submi&s;&s;ion to this Gentleman's Under&s;tanding, all this proves nothing in the Ca&s;e before us, unle&s;s it be al&s;o made appear, That the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> is acting &s;omething again&s;t the Laws of God, Nature or Rea&s;on, &s;ub|verting the Laws, Corrupting Ju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ing the Peo|ple whom they &s;hould protect, and betraying the Tru&s;t repo|&s;ed in them by their Country, and thus we are ju&s;t where we were before.</P>
<P>Indeed the Drift of my Author, appearing plainly at la&s;t, to Declare it &s;elf for a League with <HI>France,</HI> and con&s;equently a Re&s;toring &s;ome body, who <HI>this Nation, I believe, had much</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<HI>better be without,</HI> it requires no further Reply than this, and therefore I leave it.</P>
<P>I frankly own the Po&s;itions, this Per&s;on Quotes, <HI>(viz.) Of the People collectively con&s;idered, having a Right to oppo&s;e any con&s;ti|tuted Body of Government, Suppre&s;&s;ing and Betraying their Funda|mental Right.</HI></P>
<P>But I do not &s;ee any thing infer'd from hence, unle&s;s it be fir&s;t proved, That the Treaty now on foot, <HI>is a Betraying the Fundamentals of their Country, Overthrowing and Subverting the Laws, Perverting and Corrupting Ju&s;tice, and a General En&s;la|ving the People.</HI></P>
<P>Much I know has been Talkt of, to prove the&s;e things, but with &s;o little Rea&s;on, and on &s;uch Weak Fundations, that I think, I need &s;ay no more to it, till Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> or &s;ome Bo|dy for him, Refutes <HI>The Scheme of the National Right of Par|liament a&s;&s;erted in the la&s;t Tract.</HI>&mdash;Wherein I have, to the be&s;t of my Judgment, De&s;cribed it; and &s;hall willingly Recant it, when I find it not able to con&s;i&s;t with Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But before I di&s;mi&s;s this Article, and that I may give this Gentleman full &s;cope for his Argument, I offer to prove, That tho' the Fundation he lays down were Ju&s;t, <HI>which 'tis plain is otherwi&s;e,</HI> yet the Inference would not hold in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>For Example, &s;uppo&s;e (which yet I by no means grant) That the People who are the Con&s;tituents of Parliament, were &s;o far Judges of the actions of Parliament, as to have a Right to give them In&s;tructions; and as a Worthy Author has it a|mong the re&s;t of his wi&s;e Sayings, to Addre&s;s the Parliament <HI>COMMANDING them not to proceed,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Two things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow upon this mo&s;t Impor|tant Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the&s;e People &s;o Limiting the Parliament, mu&s;t be &s;uch, <HI>and only &s;uch,</HI> as have a Right of Election, for they only can Direct their Repre&s;entatives who have a
<PB N="5" REF="12">
Right to be Repre&s;ented, and they only have a Right to be Repre&s;ented, who have a Voice in the Election of a Repre&s;entative.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P> Thus, there are all your <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Armies Disbanded, and turn'd Rebels at once, and all your <HI>Dumfries</HI> Prote&s;tors with their Troops of Hor&s;e and Armies of Foot, &s;uch only excep|ted as have a Right to Vote in an Election.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>2. Of tho&s;e who have a Right of Voting in Election, the Right of Contraveening the Actions of the Members, mu&s;t depend at lea&s;t on the Majority of them; <HI>&s;ome are of the Opinion,</HI> it mu&s;t have every Individual in an A|ction of &s;uch moment: But this is certain, it mu&s;t have a Majority, and this Majority mu&s;t include the Nobi|lity too, who are not Repre&s;ented, but &s;it in Per&s;on; and how &s;hall it appear, that this Majority are in the Per&s;ons now Addre&s;&s;ing?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Let us Examine the Probability of it, for a certain Exami|nation <HI>I</HI> believe impracticable now; but as to Probability when &s;hall we &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Some of the Addre&s;&s;es have been Signed by 6, &s;ome 7, 10. 12 hands, only to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Clamour. Are the&s;e the Majori|ty of the Electors in the Shires or Towns? &s;ome have more, but 'tis where the Proportion is much greater.</P>
<P>Let us take it in the Addre&s;s of the Burghs, which has been often calculated, and take the Burghs that refu&s;ed to Addre&s;s, and the&s;e that did not think it worth while to appear, and the Majority again&s;t the Addre&s;&s;ers, is by the Proportion of <HI>their Ce&s;s</HI> as 86 to 14. Nay, &s;uppo&s;e all tho&s;e that did not ap|pear to be Affirmatives, tho' that be altogether improbable, and that they would have been for the Addre&s;s, yet the Pro|portion had been as 31 to 69.&mdash;</P>
<P>But if <HI>the Rate of the Ce&s;s</HI> be not a ju&s;t E&s;timate of the Va|lue of the Burghs, <HI>tho I can prove it was the Original of their</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="13">
<HI>Right of being Burghs;</HI> then I refer to any Man to calculate the Inhabitants and Number of Free-men in each Burgh, and he will find the 20 Burghs that refu&s;ed to addre&s;s, have more Inhabitants in them than both the 24 that addre&s;s'd, and the 22 that were ab&s;ent, the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>And where now is the Majority? and how &s;hall a Parlia|ment regulate them&s;elves by this Method? For here a Majo|rity of the Shires <HI>(&s;uppo&s;e it was &s;o)</HI> addre&s;t again&s;t the Union, and a Majority of the Burghs are for it; now take the Mi|nor Part of the Freeholders, and the Major Part of the Bur|roughs, and draw a ju&s;t Proportion of Members in the Hou&s;e, I mean of Repre&s;entatives, and add the&s;e to the great Num|ber of the Lords who are for the Union, and who are not re|pre&s;ented at all, and I dare &s;ay, the Majority would appear for the Union.</P>
<P>To take it another way, divide the Freeholders in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and place the Numbers of either the Repre&s;enting or the Re|pre&s;ented by the Value of their E&s;tates, for the Original of all depends upon the Freehold; I dare &s;ay, including the Nobi|lity, two Thirds of the Freehold of <HI>Scotland</HI> belong to &s;uch as are for the Union.</P>
<P>I care not to enter into Inviduous Compari&s;ons, <HI>as the more exact Calculating &s;uch things as the&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come to;</HI> I leave it to tho&s;e that plea&s;e to examine further into the Ma|jority: I am per&s;waded, if the&s;e People will have the Majo|rity of the Freeholders of <HI>Scotland</HI> be again&s;t the Union, they mu&s;t, <HI>as Mr.</HI> Hodges <HI>does,</HI> draw the Ladies into the Party; and if they are again&s;t it, <HI>as &s;ome &s;ay,</HI> the Rea&s;ons they give are too light for this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I think this E&s;timate of probable Majorities as ju&s;t as may &s;upport my Arguments; I'll &s;ubmit them to any Man that can confute them.</P>

As to all the re&s;t of the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who have no Right to elect Repre&s;entatives, <HI>I affirm,</HI> and think the nature of the thing demon&s;trates it, They can have no Right to direct tho&s;e who they have no part in con&s;tituting.</P>
<P>And here all the People drawn in to &s;ign Addre&s;&s;es to the Parliament again&s;t the Union, &s;o far as the Members are to be bound by the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, are meddling with what they have no Right to be meddling with, nor are any way con|cerned in.</P>

<P>The Author of this Book is hone&s;t in this, whatever he is in other things, and owns his Drift is a Treaty not with <HI>England,</HI> but with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould have entred further into his Di&s;putes of the much better Treaty with <HI>France</HI> than <HI>England,</HI> if I had not been happily prevented by a Book, which appears ju&s;t while I am writing this, entitled, <HI>The Advantages of</HI> Scotland <HI>by an Incor|porate &V;nion, &amp;c.</HI> In which he is &s;o fairly confuted, and the Argument handled &s;o clearly, that it would be an Inju&s;tice to the Gentleman that wrote it, tho I know not who he is, not to acknowledge that he has done his Country Ju&s;tice, and the Argument too; and I believe will not be replyed to in ha&s;te.</P>
<P>After what has been there &s;aid, I &s;hall not &s;o much as think my &s;elf able to &s;ay any thing fit to be added; and &s;hall al|ways let the World &s;ee, that whether I know when to &s;peak or no, I always know when to hold my Tongue.</P>

If I were a <HI>Scots</HI> Man, or if you could bear with Plain|ne&s;s and Truth from a Stranger, that &s;trives to &s;peak impar|tial Truth, and has not one Shilling to gain or lo&s;e, let it go which way it will&mdash;I would ask &s;ome of the&s;e Gentlemen, Whether they have con&s;idered their National Circum&s;tances as to <HI>England,</HI> and examin'd not how they could break with <HI>England?</HI> For I am not a going to in&s;ult <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;But in what Po&s;ture, as to Trade, <HI>Scotland</HI> would be upon an uni|ver&s;al Prohibition between <HI>England, Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, there is a kind of Prohibition already as to <HI>Eng|land:</HI> You have prohibited almo&s;t all the Manufactures, and take nothing from them you can well be without&mdash;But they have not yet treated you &s;o; they have not return'd you <HI>in kind.</HI> I would ask the&s;e Gentlemen, How they would look, and in what Condition, as to Trade and ready Money, <HI>Scotland</HI> would be, if there were equal Prohibitions and an univer&s;al Stop of Trade between the Nations, that neither your Cattle nor Linnen was admitted there; the Return of which is now wholly in Ca&s;h.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen have &s;aid, You can do without it, and perhaps you may: Come, Gentlemen, let us examine how.</P>
<P>Why fir&s;t the&s;e Gentlemen &s;ay, <HI>France</HI> will take off your Wool, Lead, Salmond and Herring&mdash;Well, Gentlemen, and what will they give you for it?&mdash;Wine, Brandy, Fruit, Silk, Toys and Trinkets. I won't engage here with the Gentlemen, and di&s;oblige the Men of the Bottle &s;o far, as to make a Calculation of the wondrous Advantages of Wine and Brandy, and how much they contribute to the Wealth of the Nation; and therefore I leave that Debate, only this I mu&s;t &s;ay, That your Import every Year exceeds your Export; and if this Trade is to encrea&s;e your Wealth and People, it will &s;till encrea&s;e your Con&s;umption; and you mu&s;t pay <HI>France</HI> the Over-plus in &s;pecie, and &s;o promote the Manufacture of
<PB N="10" REF="17">
Drunkenne&s;s at the Price of the Con&s;umption of your Bullion.</P>
<P>But then as to Wool, 'tis own'd <HI>France</HI> will take little Wool, if any of your own Growth, at lea&s;t not without <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Wool with it&mdash;And if effectual Care is taken to prevent the Export of that Wool from <HI>England,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you will find a Decay there&mdash;And if you oblige <HI>France</HI> to take your Fi&s;h, and cannot &s;upply them with Wool, you mu&s;t make them Amends &s;ome other way; as perhaps by filling their Armies with <HI>Scots</HI> Troops, and &s;ending your Gentlemen into their Service. So exporting your <HI>Scots</HI> Blood by their Gallantry and Courage, help <HI>France</HI> to pull down the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion, and en&s;lave <HI>Europe,</HI> of which Bondage you mu&s;t at la&s;t come in for a &s;hare.</P>
<P>But next to this &s;ays another Gentleman, we may export our Linnen to <HI>Spain,</HI> and our Beef to the <HI>Canaries</HI> and <HI>Madera.</HI></P>
<P>For the fir&s;t, &s;o you may, if you plea&s;e, with an Union as well as now: So that whatever you gain of Export to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> is all as clear as it was before; for you may make enough for both Trades, if you plea&s;e, and con&s;equently employ more People in the Work, more Land in the Planting, and &s;o the Trade to <HI>Spain</HI> is ju&s;t as it was, and receives no manner of Alteration.</P>
<P>For the &s;ending Beef to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;uppo&s;e the Gentlemen that have been &s;o forward in that Argument, have never been at, or have never Traded to tho&s;e I&s;lands, otherwi&s;e they would not offer &s;uch odd kind of Propo&s;als: And to &s;horten them, I di&s;creetly would revi&s;e their Calcula|tions, and compare them with the following Circum&s;tances, and then I per&s;wade my &s;elf they will have Honour enough to change their Sentiments.</P>
<P>1&s;t. <HI>England</HI> in the Year 1699 took from <HI>Scotland</HI> in Trade, and for which they paid ready Money,
<LIST>
<PB N="11" REF="18">

</LIST>
Over and be&s;ides the Number of both &s;orts, which are &s;e|cretly convoyed over the Borders, and which is impo&s;&s;ible, the Tract of Land being &s;o great, can by any Vigilance of Of|ficers be prevented; which &s;ome &s;ay amounts to as many more, but all agree, are a very great Quantity.</P>
<P>Now I would be glad to know, where the Gentlemen would export this Quantity of Cattel.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>Canaries</HI> and <HI>Madera,</HI> the Inhabitants are few, the Fle&s;h they eat little; and if they were to have all the Beef they buy from <HI>Scotland,</HI> they would not take off 5000 Bullocks or Beeves a year.</P>
<P N="2">2. They have <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> from whence they are &s;upplied with Pipe-&s;taves, which ly &s;o much nearer to them; and from whom they are &s;upplied with Beef and Pork, &s;o cheap, that I wonder how the&s;e Gentlemen could think of tho&s;e Places to &s;ell thirty thou&s;and Black Cattel a year in.</P>
<P>If they could &s;ell tho&s;e Cattel, where would they &s;ell the Returns? <HI>Madera</HI> Wine they could not di&s;po&s;e of any where, and of <HI>Canary</HI> but a &s;mall Quantity, without Help of <HI>England;</HI> and Silver is not to be had in tho&s;e I&s;lands: Which way they would either make their Returns, or get Loading back for their Ships, is a My&s;tery pa&s;t any Man's Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="4">4. But were all the&s;e Difficulties over, had tho&s;e I&s;lands no Fle&s;h from the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> had <HI>Scotland</HI> a vent at home for 20 Ships Load of <HI>Canary</HI> and <HI>Modera</HI> Wine to &s;ecure their Ships a back Freight.&mdash;Yet at la&s;t, I &s;ay, they could not Sell ten Barrels of Beef a year, in either <HI>Canaries</HI> or <HI>Madera,</HI>&mdash;And I think the Rea&s;on is plain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Beef is &s;o much Better, &s;o much Cheaper, and their Shipping and Sailing &s;o much Ea&s;ier, that they would
<PB N="12" REF="19">
be able to out-&s;ell them there, reckoning Value and Price a|bove a hundred <HI>per Cent:</HI>&mdash;Now to make this out, I &s;hall not give the Reader the trouble of Calculations, only let him know, that the be&s;t <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Beef, Large and Fat, not to make Compari&s;on, has been to be had at <HI>Kin&s;ale, Cork</HI> or <HI>Galloway,</HI> for under 6 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Hundred weight, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, that is to &s;ay, for very little more than half penny <HI>Sterling per lib.</HI> and I leave the Calcule to any Body that plea&s;e to make it.</P>
<P>While this is &s;o, I mu&s;t take leave to &s;ay, neither <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> nay, nor <HI>New-England,</HI> or <HI>New York,</HI> can come in|to that Trade.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Selling their Beef to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, and &s;ending it in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bottoms, can carry the <HI>Madera</HI> Wines to the I&s;lands, or bring the <HI>Canarie</HI> Wines to <HI>England</HI> in the &s;ame Ship; this the <HI>Scots</HI> can never come up to <HI>without an &V;ni|on:</HI> and I appeal to all the World, for the Truth of Fact in this particular.</P>
<P>Where the Gentlemen then will di&s;po&s;e of 30000 to 50000 of Black Cattel to Ballance the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, I know not.</P>
<P>I Recommend this Thought, to tho&s;e Gentlemen who are &s;o very warm for Draw-backs upon Beef Exported for Sale; and I would be glad, they would tell us, to what place of the World the whole I&s;land of <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;ends 10 La&s;t of Beef in Seven Year for Sale; and if &s;o, why they will Clog the Trea|ty with &s;uch Demands.&mdash;</P>
<P>I come next to the Linnen, You have in the Publick account of the Exports of Linnen, to <HI>England</HI> and other parts, above 1800000 Ells of Linnen carried out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in one year.</P>
<P>This may be all &s;ent to <HI>Spain, they &s;ay;</HI> &s;uppo&s;e that were true, <HI>tho' as to quantity I que&s;tion it,</HI> yet &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as every body knows, have &s;ent none of this to <HI>Spain,</HI> the War having Stopt that Trade; then if the <HI>Scots</HI> can &s;end &s;o much to <HI>Spain,</HI> they yet lo&s;e the Sale of &s;o much more in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">
So that here is above 800000 Ells of Linnen, 31608 Black Cattle, and 25240 Sheep, left on your hands, by rejecting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade; and all the ready Money they bring with them now, kept out of the Kingdom, upon a breach with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I would be glad to &s;ee the&s;e Gentlemen, offer &s;ome of their Equivalents for this, for an Equivalent, <HI>as much as they banter that poor Word,</HI> mu&s;t be had &s;ome where, or el&s;e it will be wor&s;e.&mdash;Above all, I wait for their <HI>French</HI> Equivalent, and the account of the Return they would make from <HI>France,</HI> for their Fi&s;h, Lead and Wool.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e, they will not ex|pect to &s;end Linnen to <HI>France.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>While I am Writing this, I am pre&s;ented with a Book Inti|tled, <HI>A Letter concerning the Con&s;equences of an Incorporating &V;|nion, in relation to Trade.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> confe&s;s it is a wonderful Book, &amp; partakes of the re&s;t of the Miracles of this Age, wherein Arguments are rai&s;ed out of con|tradicting Sy&s;tems, to Prove and Di&s;prove what Men plea&s;e. I mu&s;t own, <HI>I</HI> think the Author of this Book, &s;eems to be in a Plot for the Union, and that by laying down Arguments, that even the Gentlemen, who have Declared again&s;t the Union, have too much Sen&s;e than to make u&s;e of, he would confound the Debate with Ab&s;urdities and Contradictions, and argue People into it by &s;howing them a heap of Ridiculous Arguments again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I can not &s;atisfie my &s;elf, to wa&s;te either my own time or the Reader's, with entering into his manifold weighty Rea|&s;ons, but I'll repeat a few of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. He tells us, That all Trade is Exchanging one Com|modity for another, for the Convenience of Life and the &s;upplying Nations with what their Neighbours have, which they want.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting this, he is merry on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, and thinks he banters tho&s;e who &s;ay 'tis Advantageous to <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ince, &s;ays he, we &s;hall only get one Commodity for another.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="21">
Without running his length, I &s;hall bring it to a &s;hort head. His notion of Trade by Exchanges is Right enough, only that he forgot to &s;ay, That where any Nation has more want of Foreign Goods, than She has Goods of her own to purcha&s;e them with, She mu&s;t make up the Value in Money.</P>
<P>On this turns the whole State of the Que&s;tion, and the Gen|tleman was in the right to forget it, for it would have over|thrown all his Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>Money is an Intrin&s;ick, plac'd as a Medium in the Center of Trade, to &s;upply the differences in Value, between the Ex|port and Import of one Nation to and from another.</P>
<P>This is what we call Ballance of Trade, a thing many People talk of, tho' few under&s;tand.</P>
<P>That Nation only can be &s;aid to Gain by another, who &s;end more Value in its own Product to that other Nation, than is receiv'd from it, becau&s;e the Ballance mu&s;t be made good in this Intrin&s;ick, called <HI>Specie.</HI></P>
<P>From hence 'tis a certain Maxim in Trade, That what ever any Country can part with of its own Growth and Pro|duct, is &s;o much clear Gain to the publick Stock of that Nation.</P>
<P>Whatever any Nation wants of the Growth and Product of another Nation, is &s;o much Dead Lo&s;s to the Public Stock of that Nation.</P>
<P>And the Con&s;equence is Natural, that which a Nation partswith, or wants mo&s;t in tho&s;e Terms, Gains or Lo&s;es ju&s;t &s;o much in the General Ballance of Trade.</P>
<P>The&s;e are things too plain to need Repetition, and had not this Gentleman forgot this, whether wilfully or no, I do not determine, he would have never &s;aid at fir&s;t, <HI>That</HI> Scotland <HI>does not want the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Money,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;ay every Nation wants to Export all the Product of their Country they can &s;pare, and all the Product of their Peoples Labour they can &s;pare;
<PB N="15" REF="22">
and every Nation wants their Neighbours Money for their Product, becau&s;e every Nation wants <HI>in the Language of Trade</HI> to be Gainers.</P>
<P>And therefore to Export the People, in&s;tead of the Labour of the People is by the way, letting out the Life-Blood of a Nation: but of that by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>It remains therefore for this Gentleman, to tell us on a fair Examination, not whether you want the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, or no, now, or after the &V;nion; but whether you gain Money by it or no, let any one tell me, whether you Gain by it or no? I'll tell him whether you want it or no.&mdash;</P>
<P>To find out this I &s;hall come to his own worthy Argu|ment <HI>Pag.</HI> 6&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'We &s;hall Import into <HI>England</HI> (&s;ays he) all our Commo|dities; as to the Word <HI>free of Duttes,</HI> I ll &s;peak to it by it &s;elf.&mdash;<HI>But he goes on,</HI> We &s;end Linnen Cloth into <HI>England:</HI> What &s;hall we get in return? Why Woollen Cloth, or what el&s;e the Per&s;ons that &s;ell the Linnen think they can get mo&s;t by at Home.</Q>&mdash;And from hence this worthy Gentleman concludes, <HI>Here can be no Gain to</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>Now I'll only &s;tate the Ca&s;e on a Suppo&s;ition, which I think no Man can deny me.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ends Linnen Cloth to <HI>England,</HI> to the Va|ue of 200000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> and the Per&s;ons that &s;ell it there, can &s;ell but 100000 <HI>l.</HI> in the Woollen return.&mdash;What mu&s;t the Merchant bring Home? And how mu&s;t <HI>England</HI> pay for the Linnen?&mdash;Mu&s;t it not be in Money, and Who is the Gainer?</P>
<P>From hence I leave it to the Reader to Calculate, <HI>Scotland</HI> has &s;ent 1828415 Ells of Linnen to <HI>England</HI> 31608 Black Cattel, 25420 Sheep in one Year, Pray what returns have they fetcht for this Trade? not VVoollen Goods, I believe any Body will
<PB N="16" REF="23">
grant. Who then has been the Gainer in that Year of Trade, <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>The Objection that this is before the &V;nion, is not to the Pur|po&s;e for after the Union, your Export may be Double in Coal, Salt, Corn and Wool, your Linnen double, and the like.</P>
<P>Then it will remain to ask, How is it po&s;&s;ible <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould con&s;ume a Quantity of Woollen Goods from <HI>England</HI> equal to this, you having both Wool and Manufactures of your own proportioned? 'tis impracticable, and where then all the re&s;t of your Export mu&s;t be &s;upplyed, is another of this Author's &V;naccountables.</P>
<P>But &s;ays he, It is pretended <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t Export the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Goods again to the Plantations: This makes Good what I &s;aid before, That he offers this to Banter the Oppo&s;ers of the &V;nion, and bring them in talking ridiculou&s;ly, on purpo&s;e to expo&s;e them.</P>
<P>For no Body ever but him&s;elf, pretended that <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould Trade to the Colonies with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods; that were to make it a Trade and no Trade to them, turn them into meer Pedlars, or Second-hand Chap-men, and to put a Ban|ter upon the Colonies, to think they &s;hould &s;end to <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture, when at the &s;ame time, they Trade to <HI>England</HI> directly.</P>
<P>And why pray cannot <HI>Scotland</HI> Trade to the Colonies with her own Product, and the Labour of her own People? Her Lin|nens, her low priz'd Woollens are as vendible, and as much wanted there, as any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods what ever, and &s;he wants no quantity.</P>
<P>Her Returns for the&s;e are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The imployment of her Shipping and Seamen. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Product of the Plan|tations, which she now buys in <HI>England,</HI> and bringing which
<PB N="17" REF="24">
from the Colonies, will encrea&s;e the Ballance between <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;till higher.</P>
<P>But &s;ays the Author, You cannot di&s;po&s;e of the Sugars and Tobacco; and if you &s;end them Abroad, you get nothing but Linnen from <HI>Holland,</HI> or Lace from <HI>Flanders,</HI> or Naval Stores from the Ea&s;t.&mdash;Very good. Do you want the&s;e things or no? If you do not, you wont Import them; if you do, you will Import them, and unle&s;s you can pay for them in Goods, you mu&s;t in Money: So that &s;till the Advantage of Exporting your Tobacco and Sugar is equal to Exporting your own Product; becau&s;e it either returns you directly in Money, or &s;aves you &s;ending your own Money abroad, which is letting the Nation blood in the Vitals.</P>
<P>Thus, with Submi&s;&s;ion to this Gentleman, bringing things back to fir&s;t Principles, will unravel all this Clue of Knotty Argument, and if I Mi&s;take not, will di&s;cover the Nakedne&s;s of it more than &s;ufficiently to the World.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Author, to An&s;wer an Objection of the <HI>Scots</HI> Working Cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> has this further Deep Con&s;ideration, That either the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mu&s;t come down to our low Wages, or the <HI>Scots</HI> mu&s;t come up to their high Wages; and therefore the <HI>Scots</HI> Manufactures cannot be Cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Now to make this out, I de&s;ire, he would be plea&s;ed then to reconcile the following Heads to his Maxim, That <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall not get by the Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He &s;ays, The Workmen will certainly Live where they can get mo&s;t for their Labour, <HI>That I grant him readily.</HI></P>
<P>Now, If the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould be forced to be brought down to the low Wages in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it mu&s;t be, that they &s;ee the <HI>Scots</HI> fall &s;o heartily into their Manufactures, &V;nder&s;el and
<PB N="18" REF="25">
and Underwork them, that if they do not &s;ink the Price too, they &s;hall lo&s;e their Trade. Or,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If the <HI>Scots</HI> come up to the high Wages of <HI>England,</HI> the poor People will live here, as well as they do in <HI>England,</HI> and the Trade will be in Proportion Greater; and I will be Content to hear, which of the&s;e Con&s;equences will be a Dam|nage to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But now, Gentlemen, more Wonders are arriv'd, and the Strangene&s;s to me is very Great, I Confe&s;s, except that 'tis true that Miracles are not Cea&s;ed, and this is very Particular.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He &s;ays, and introduces it with an <HI>I AFFIRM</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> can be no Gainers by the Freedom of their Trade to the Plantations; Nay, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would give the <HI>Scots</HI> all their Plantations, they would be no Advantage to them.</ITEM>

<P>And how could we Gain by our Manufactures, if there was not a Foreign Trade to Vent them?</P>
<P>But we Gain nothing, but what is returned in unperi&s;hable Commodities,&mdash;Allow that now,&mdash;Why then, we have
<PB N="19" REF="26">
Gain'd all the ready Money in <HI>England,</HI> all the Plate, all the Bullion, all the Iron, Bra&s;s, Steel, or Mettals imported.</P>
<P>All the Moveable Stock of the Nation, is clear Gain to it, be it in Ships Buildings, Furniture, Stores, Wares, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How have they Gain'd all this? it mu&s;t be by Trade, and the Per&s;onal E&s;tates in <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as Hou&s;es, Ships, Goods, Cattel, Plate, Jewels, Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are computed at much more than the Value of the Fee &s;imple of all the Land at 100 Years Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>But I'll tyre you no more with this Mi&s;erable Stuff, pray, Gentlemen, pardon me the Freedom I take with this Author, and do not think I imagine <HI>Scotland</HI> can be capable of &s;uch Non&s;ence; I am very well a&s;&s;ured, this is another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Au|thor, and that this Book came from <HI>England,</HI> it ta&s;tes both of the Spirit, the Temper and &V;nder&s;tanding of &s;ome Gentle|men there, who &s;et up to In&s;truct you here, in what you know better than they.</P>
<P>But now, Gentlemen, to come Home to your own Trade with <HI>England,</HI> either as it is, or as it may be with or without an &V;nion.</P>
<P>If an &V;nion go on, 'tis alledg'd you &s;hall have higher Cu|&s;toms than you have now.&mdash;To this the Re&s;olution of your Committee is a full Reply, in which they tell you, how all the Cu&s;toms of <HI>England</HI> which &s;hall expire at 1710, being deducted, your Cu&s;toms Rated on the pre&s;ent Export and Import of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be le&s;s than they are now, by 150000 <HI>l. Scots per Annum,</HI> be&s;ides upwards of 220000 <HI>l. Scots</HI> taken off from your Manufactures when Exported to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This, I think, has in a manner &s;ilenc'd the Gentlemen, that throng'd the Town with their Calculs of Cu&s;toms ri&s;ing upon you, as &s;omething el&s;e has done about the Re-payment of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>The Trade lying thus, let me &s;tate it two ways.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="27">
'Tis evident by the Report of the Per&s;ons employ'd by the Government to calculate this, that your Exports to <HI>England</HI> now without an Union, amount to 200000 lib. Sterling <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>No Man has yet ventur'd to &s;ay, That you make any Re|turns from thence that bear a Proportion to this,&mdash;all their Manufactures being prohibit. But becau&s;e I would give all rea&s;onable Allowance, I am content to &s;uppo&s;e, that you receive from <HI>England</HI> in Goods 50000 li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>per Annum.</HI> I'll &s;up|po&s;e, that the Noblemen and Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland</HI> in their Expen&s;es, and the Fine Things they buy there, &s;pend 50000 lib. more, tho both the&s;e Sums exceedingly out-do the Pro|bability of the thing.</P>
<P>But this being allowed, then 'tis yet true, that <HI>Scotland</HI> gets 100000 lib. <HI>per Annum</HI> in Money from <HI>England</HI> by Trade; how &s;he would make her &s;elf Amends for that Lo&s;s by a Trade to <HI>France,</HI> I can &s;ee no room to find out: And for a Trade to <HI>Spain,</HI> She has it with the Trade to <HI>England,</HI> and may enlarge it as &s;he thinks fit; and <HI>England</HI> will help, not hinder Her to enlarge it.</P>
<P>If then you get 100000 lib. <HI>per Annum</HI> by <HI>England,</HI> 'tis a good Trade without an Union: Let's now examine if the U|nion will make it greater or le&s;s; and upon this the whole State of the Ca&s;e will turn.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We are told here, that after the Union, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures will throng in upon <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;And tho' I think 'tis your own Fault, if you do not make all the &s;ame you do now, and both better and cheaper: yet for di&s;|cour&s;e &s;ake, &s;uppo&s;e you to buy the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Goods; pray what Goods &s;hall you &s;end to <HI>England</HI> then, more than you do now?</P>
<P>If then after the Union, you &s;hall &s;end more Goods to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> over and above the Quantity you now &s;end, than you
<PB N="21" REF="28">
&s;hall receive from thence, over and above what you now re|ceive, you are &s;till more Gainers than you were before.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I am to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the Import of Tobacco, Sugar, Ginger, Dye &s;tuffs, &amp;c. which come from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;hall be taken off from the Debit of your Import from <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince either you will have them directly from thence, and in return for your own Manufactures and Money to boot, or you mu&s;t be much weaker in your pur&s;uing your own Advantages, than I take ye to he.</P>
<P>If you imported 50000 lib. <HI>per Annum</HI> in Goods from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> I believe, a full half of that Sum is made up by tho&s;e kinds of Goods, with which we are &s;upplied from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To encrea&s;e this Trade to <HI>England,</HI> I come to ask a few Que&s;tions, which I would be glad to hear any Body an&s;wer.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How many Coals &s;hall go away yearly from the Firth of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> when 7 <HI>&s;h.</HI> and 6 <HI>d.</HI> Duty is taken off by the Union, and they as cheap here as at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> and 5 &s;h. <HI>per</HI> Chalder always above them at <HI>London?</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, when I have &s;aid, it &s;hall amount to 100000 Chalder, I have been blam'd, as not gue&s;&s;ing above half the Quantity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How many Weigh of Salt, of which &s;ome &s;ay 20000 Wey? I am content to &s;ay half that Quantity, and I dare &s;ay, it &s;hall not fall &s;hort of that.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. VVhat Quantity of Corn &s;hall go to <HI>England</HI> yearly, e&s;pecially that we call <HI>Hor&s;e-Corn,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Oats, Beans</HI> and <HI>Pea&s;e,</HI> which always yield a good Price at <HI>London,</HI> and much more than in <HI>Scotland?</HI> If this Article does not amount to 100000 <HI>l: per Annum</HI> more, <HI>then I have no gue&s;s at what</HI> Scotland <HI>can part with of tho&s;e Sorts;</HI> for I am free to &s;ay, If they will &s;end them to <HI>England,</HI> they will always buy them there, and at a good Price.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="22" REF="29">
4. <HI>The Wool,</HI> and now we come to a great <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> What Amends will be made to <HI>Scotland</HI> for the lo&s;s of the Wool Trade, and the difference of Price, between the Wool after the Prohibition, and what it is now, when we Export it Abroad?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>To this I An&s;wer,</HI> Sinking the Price indeed is the Immediate Con&s;equence, but the pre&s;ent Exporting it has &s;everal attend|ing Circum&s;tances, which I conceive are not &s;ufficiently con|&s;idered, by tho&s;e who are &s;o angry at this head.</P>
<P N="1">1. The pre&s;ent Price of Wool, for which the <HI>Sheep-Ma&s;ters</HI> claim a Satisfaction, is not an Original; the fir&s;t Exporting the Wool <HI>Rai&s;ed it,</HI> and &s;topping that Export, is only Checking the Exorbitant Gain they make now, at the Price of their Country's Ruin, and bringing them back <HI>where they were be|fore.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis a Trade De&s;tructive to Indu&s;try, Ruinous to Manu|factures, and tends to Robbing the Poor of their Imployment; as is evident in your Exporting it to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and the North; where, if they had not <HI>your Wool,</HI> they mu&s;t Buy <HI>your cour&s;e Manufactures,</HI> and certainly Buy the le&s;s of the one, by how much the more they get of the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. If you will not work your Wool at home, tho' that is certainly your Advantage, e&s;pecially, when you may then have <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool freely to mix with it.&mdash;Still you may &s;end it all to <HI>England,</HI> who <HI>opens their Doors</HI> to all the Wool, the whole World thinks fit to &s;end them.</P>
<P>If it be Objected, they will not give the Price you get for it Abroad? <HI>I An&s;wer,</HI> They will give, what you had better take than the Foreign Price, and what you &s;hall get as much by.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I have 100 Packs of Wool at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> 50 Packs I'll &s;end to <HI>France,</HI> or to <HI>Sweden, or where you like,</HI> and for that I'll get 10 <HI>&s;: per</HI> Stone; 50 I &s;end to <HI>England,</HI> and for that I get
<PB N="23" REF="30">
but 5 <HI>&s;: per</HI> Stone; yet I &s;ay, I had better &s;end to <HI>England</HI> than Abroad. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I run the Ri&s;que of the Sea <HI>On-ward</HI> bound, next the Ri&s;que of Factors and Buyers <HI>Abroad.</HI> 2. I pay Freight and Commi&s;&s;ion Abroad. 3. The Ri&s;que <HI>is Repeated</HI> back a|gain on the Sea.&mdash;And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> All this, at lea&s;t, Imploys the Stock &s;ix Months in time.</P>
<P>If I think fit to Trade to <HI>England</HI> for Wool, I can always Sell it, and always Sell it for Ready Money, and may if I plea&s;e, make 12 Returns of my Money, in that 6 Months time which I take in one Voyage the other way; and in doing this, I run no Ri&s;que at all, and have my Money in my hand every time.</P>
<P>If it be Objected, The price to the Wool-Ma&s;ter is low. I <HI>An&s;wer, England</HI> will give as much for yours, as for their own in proportion to its Goodne&s;s.&mdash;If yours is not &s;o good as &s;ome of theirs, it is better than others, and &s;till you have Neighbours Fair and Right Dealing.</P>
<P>I could run out here, and not Unprofitably perhaps tell you, That the Badne&s;s of your Wool in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is not owing either to the <HI>Climate,</HI> the <HI>Soil,</HI> the Nature of the <HI>Gra&s;s,</HI> or any of tho&s;e Circum&s;tances the Flegmatick Fancies of &s;ome People Sugge&s;t, <HI>which &s;ome,</HI> tho' they care not to hear other Folks Mention, are forward enough to mention them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I could take the liberty to tell the&s;e Gentlemen, <HI>and perhaps make it out too,</HI> That the Cour&s;ene&s;s of the Wool here, is owing to the ill Husbandry of the People, not the Inclemencies of Nature; and that they are too forward to Injure their own Country, and load her with the Effects of their own Inexcu&s;|able Negligence; and this both in the Mi&s;s-u&s;ing the Sheep that breed this Wool, and &s;poiling the Wool with Tar, Grea&s;e, and horrible fooli&s;h Applications to it, when it is on the Sheeps back.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="31">
Indeed I avoid entring on this Matter here, becau&s;e I am preparing an E&s;&s;ay upon the Improvement of <HI>Scotland</HI> by it &s;elf, which I de&s;ign for the Publick Service in this very ca&s;e; but this I undertake to &s;ay <HI>before hand,</HI> with re&s;pect to the Wool, That whether by better Management, your VVool might be made as Good as <HI>Engli&s;h, I do not affirm,</HI> tho' I be|lieve it.&mdash;But certainly by your Management there, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> VVool might be brought to be every whit as bad as yours.</P>
<P>Negligence and ill Husbandry, will Spoil the be&s;t Country in the VVorld, and the be&s;t Product in the VVorld; and <HI>tho' I am not for finding Fault,</HI> yet I mu&s;t own the Conduct of the Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> with their Sheep, and <HI>not a little with their Land too,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t Unaccountable things in the VVorld.&mdash;And if I have the Honour to Dictate &s;ome Me|thods of Rectification in the&s;e ca&s;es, to their Advantage, whe|ther they make the Experiment or no, I hope no Man will be angry with me, or count me an Enemy to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for &s;howing the way to its Improvement.</P>
<P>But <HI>I proceed</HI> to the Trade of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and I cannot but en|ter a little here into a &s;hort Trifle of Trade, call'd The Trade to <HI>America</HI> or the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and 'tis very Remarkable and well worth Ob&s;ervation; what pains has been taken to render this as the mo&s;t Contemptible thing in the VVorld, a thing not worth <HI>England</HI>'s granting or <HI>Scotland</HI>'s accepting, much le&s;s a thing that <HI>England</HI> ought to Value her &s;elf upon, or &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;t that <HI>Scotland</HI> is beholding to her for.</P>
<P><HI>One Author has the face to &s;ay, England</HI> never got any thing by the Trade of the Colonies her &s;elf, and if &s;he would give them to <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was not a Gift <HI>worth Receiving,</HI> nor could <HI>Scotland</HI> be ever the better for it.</P>
<P><HI>I confe&s;s the&s;e are &s;trange things,</HI> and 'tis hard to have to do with &s;ome kind of Gentlemen in Trade, who give them&s;elves
<PB N="25" REF="32">
a liberty to &s;ay what they plea&s;e, without being Encumbred with, or any way Subjecting them&s;elves <HI>to the Bondage</HI> of &s;peaking Truth.</P>
<P>And yet this Mon&s;truous Story, as I am told, comes from <HI>England,</HI> from whence I only draw one Inference, <HI>(viz.) That this Ignorance is not for want of an Opportunity of knowing bet|ter.</HI>&mdash;But there are &s;ome Gentlemen there, who have all a|long carefully furni&s;ht the Town here, with &s;omething which no Man dur&s;t &s;ay, but &s;uch as are <HI>out of Sight</HI> as to Blu&s;hing, and <HI>out of Hearing</HI> as to Reproach.</P>
<P>The &s;hort <HI>Scale of the Trade</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e Heads, which when they are right &s;tated, I &s;hall think 'tis ea&s;y for any body to Determine whether that Trade is to be carried on to the Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> yea or no?</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What you carry out is entirely, <HI>if you plea&s;e,</HI> the Product of your own Land, and the Labour of your own People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>What you bring home,</HI> may, at lea&s;t &frac34; parts of it, be a|gain Exported by you to Foreign parts, and the Pro|duct by con&s;equence return to you in Money; and <HI>if the remaining</HI> &frac14; <HI>part is expended at home,</HI> 'tis expended in the room of tho&s;e Goods of the &s;ame kind, which you now buy with your Money in <HI>England, or with your Goods at a &s;hort Advance,</HI> and which would otherwi&s;e return you Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>What Goods you carry out</HI> to the Colonies, are general|ly Sold there, at the extravagant Advance of 100 <HI>per Cent:</HI> Profit on the Continent, and <HI>if for Lo&s;s on the I&s;lands,</HI> then great quantities of Bullion are return'd home for them, in the return of which, the Lo&s;s is le&s;s in Proportion.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>Here is Publi&s;hed, <HI>A Letter from &s;ome Merchants of the</HI> Scots <HI>Nation Re&s;iding at</HI> London, where this Trade is E&s;timated to 400000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> Profit to the Traders of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the <HI>Guinea</HI> Trade to 50000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> I confe&s;s in the length of the particulars they <HI>Out-do me,</HI> and it mu&s;t be &s;ome time before <HI>Scotland</HI> can carry it on to that hight.&mdash;Indeed, I for|bear Compting the Advantages of the&s;e things, becau&s;e I do not affect talking of Millions and great Sums.&mdash;But look in|to the&s;e things, Gentlemen, <HI>you that are to be convinc't by De|mon&s;trations,</HI> take them to pieces your &s;elves, &s;ee if you can a|void <HI>Confe&s;&s;ing the Advantages;</HI> &s;ee if &s;uch a Trade can be driven without a prodigious Gain, without incredible Fluxes of Wealth to the Nation <HI>in General,</HI> as well as to the Mer|chants <HI>in particular.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ay, you have no Manufactures fit for the Colonies, or that you mu&s;t <HI>Buy them from</HI> England, is to &s;ay, you have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, no Wool, no Flax.&mdash;Or to &s;ay, you <HI>will not</HI> make u&s;e of them; and certainly if you will not &s;tir, you &s;hall always be poor. He that will not Eat, <HI>mu&s;t be Starv'd,</HI> there is no Remedy.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould the Gentlemen, that <HI>talk you up &s;o high</HI> on one hand, and threaten the great Things you can do another way, <HI>talk you down &s;o low in this,</HI> as if you were a Nation that had netheir Hands to Work, Heads to Direct, or Under&s;tandings to clo&s;e with Advantages of Commerce and Improvement, when they were put into your Hands.</P>
<P>I allow <HI>Scotland</HI> is, <HI>and has been,</HI> under Di&s;couragement both as to Foreign Trade and Manufactures. <HI>I allow</HI> your Poor are very low, and your Rich Men backward to Launch out.&mdash;And any Man, that takes me in the general &s;cope, will ea&s;ily &s;ee, this was the Intent and Meaning of my Arguing in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> when I wrote <HI>the &s;econd</HI> of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, and Argued, that
<PB N="27" REF="34">
you &s;hould be Exempted for &s;ome years from the Taxes on <HI>Malt</HI> and <HI>Salt.</HI></P>
<P>And I cannot but think, that Noble Lord, <HI>asking his Lord &s;hip</HI>'s <HI>Pardon for this Freedom,</HI> who quoted my Arguments on this head in Parliament, will do me that Ju&s;tice, that they were all concluded in this very thing; and had his Lord&s;hip thought fit to have quoted but one Paragraph further, it would have appear'd, <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> II. <HI>P.</HI> 29. That <HI>Scotland</HI> being very low, <HI>and the Poor Unable to</HI> pay Taxes at all, &s;hould <HI>be Exempted from the Taxes of Malt and Salt, for a certain term of years.</HI></P>
<P>Now, If I fir&s;t concluded the Poor unable to bear the Bur|then of the Salt and Malt Tax at all, why &s;hould I argue for Limited Exemption?</P>
<P><HI>But on this Suppo&s;ition,</HI> That by the Increa&s;e of Trade, Shipping, Manufactures and Labour, the Increa&s;e of Wages, and bettering the way of the Poor's Living, would be the Con|&s;equence, and then the Taxes would not be equally Burthen|&s;ome as now.</P>
<P>In this, if I may be allowed to plead any Merit with <HI>Scot|land,</HI> who am a Stranger, was then in <HI>England,</HI> and yet mo|ved earne&s;tly for Ea&s;e and Exemption for the Poor of this Kingdom, till they &s;hould be enabled to pay Taxes, I think I acted a part no Man here ought to blame me for; and 'tis a little hard to draw an Argument from thence, that therefore <HI>they mu&s;t never be charged at all.</HI></P>
<P>Without doubt, if Trade in <HI>Scotland</HI> encrea&s;es, Labour will encrea&s;e; if Labour encrea&s;es, Wages will encrea&s;e; for a Demand of Work makes a Demand of Wages of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>So that I think, there remains only to prove, that there will be an Encrea&s;e of Trade: I think I have perform'd that in part; I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee &s;ome other more able Hand perfect my Generals into Particulars by Schemes of Profit and Advantage <HI>on the Returns</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the Advantages of
<PB N="28" REF="35">
building Ships, and con&s;equently a great <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Baltick</HI> Trade for Fi&s;h out, and Naval Stores home; again, on the Number of Families employ'd at home in Building, Fitting and Furni&s;hing Ships; and la&s;tly, the Nur&s;ery of Sea men, and employing them in your own Ships, with the Con&s;equen|ces of &s;uch a Trade.</P>
<P>Were due and ju&s;t Schemes of the&s;e things laid down, I cannot but believe the mouths of tho&s;e People would for ever be &s;topt, who le&s;&s;en and mi&s;repre&s;ent the Advantages of Trade which <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall obtain.</P>
<P>It is enough however to my purpo&s;e, having not room here for Particulars to have laid down this general Scheme of a profitable Trade&mdash;</P>
<P>That Trade only can be profitable, which employing their own People, carries out their own Growth or Product, and does not con&s;ume all the Returns, but draws in the Surplus to it &s;elf in Bullion, and this you do here exactly. To ex|plain this,</P>
<P>I would be glad any Man would &s;tate me the following Voyage, &s;uppo&s;e a thou&s;and Pound <HI>Sterling</HI> in <HI>Scots</HI> Linnen, and in Woollen Goods &s;ent to <HI>New-England, New York,</HI> or <HI>Virginia,</HI> in a <HI>Scots</HI> Ship, and is there ve&s;ted in Sugars, Mella&s;&s;es or Tobacco, at the u&s;ual Rate of Advance in tho&s;e Places, which is too <HI>per Cent,</HI> &s;ometimes much more.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Returns come &s;afe home to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and being not con&s;umed here, are again exported to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in a <HI>Scots</HI> Ve&s;&s;el al&s;o, and at la&s;t the Effects produce 1250 lib. <HI>Sterling</HI> clear of all Charges, which is no unu&s;ual nor extraordinary thing.</P>
<P>What Profit does <HI>Scotland</HI> gain by this Voyage? I &s;ay, <HI>Scot|land,</HI> becau&s;e we are to examine the Encrea&s;e to the Publick Stock, as well as to the private Merchant, in the Di&s;cour&s;e we are now upon.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="36">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Scotland <HI>gains</HI> all the Profit of the Labour of the Peo|ple in the Manufactures that were exported, for all the Wa|ges any Per&s;on earns in <HI>Scotland</HI> by his Labour, over and a|bove what his Sub&s;i&s;tance co&s;t him during his Labour, <HI>is clear gain to the general Stock.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Scotland <HI>gains</HI> all the Profit of the Labour of every Per&s;on employ'd on Board the Ship for that Voyage, and of the Labour of all the Artificers, Labourers, &amp;c. employ'd in furni&s;hing that Ship for that Voyage.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> All the Provi&s;ions expended in the Voyage, and all the Stores carried out, and not brought home, are clear Gain to the Stock of the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Scotland <HI>gains</HI> all the Particulars of the &s;ame kinds again, on the Ship that carries the Goods away to <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Scotland <HI>gains</HI> the Profit on the foot of the Voyage to the Merchant and Owners.</P>
<P>So that, if the Merchant here clears but 250 lib. by his Voyage, the National Publick Advantage may be 1500 lib. more, in the Freights and Furniture of the Ship and Cargo.</P>
<P>From hence <HI>'tis al&s;o worth note,</HI> That if 20 &s;uch Ships a Year went out from <HI>Scotland,</HI> it might very well be po&s;&s;ible, that the Merchant &s;hould not get a Farthing, nay might lo&s;e by the Voyage, and yet the Publick National Stock be Gainer at lea&s;t 25000 lib. <HI>Sterl. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>If any Man will <HI>after this</HI> tell me, That <HI>Scotland</HI> shall get nothing by the Plantation Trade,&mdash;I mu&s;t own he is no Man for me to talk with, I mu&s;t leave him to his own Delu|&s;ions.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this E&s;&s;ay with only one Note about the Popular Objection, <HI>That after the Union</HI> all your Places, Pre|ferments and Offices in the Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, Taxes, Army
<PB N="30" REF="37">
and Navy, will be at the Di&s;po&s;al of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI> will be put upon you in all tho&s;e Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>It is not for me to determine, who shall or shall not be put into Places of Tru&s;t <HI>in this Nation;</HI> I make no que&s;tion the Government will regard the Recommendation of the Council and of Hone&s;t Men here, as it does now in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But I would have the&s;e Gentlemen con&s;ider two or three things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Why should the Government be more partial to <HI>Eng|land</HI> as to Places here, <HI>than at home in their own Coun|try,</HI> where a <HI>Scots-man,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;eparate Po&s;ture of the Nations, is as capable of Preferment as an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> and promi&s;cou&s;ly preferr'd on all Occa&s;ions?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Would the&s;e Gentlemen be content to retain that Mark of Di&s;tinction between the Nations, that <HI>Scots-men</HI> only should be preferr'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> in <HI>England?</HI> And would not <HI>Scotland</HI> be va&s;tly a Lo&s;er by it, while many of Her Nation are now in Places of the greate&s;t Honour and Tru&s;t in <HI>England?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Is it any Mark of <HI>England</HI>'s Partiality to <HI>Scotland,</HI> much le&s;s of any Di&s;tru&s;t of the Nation, That the on|ly three &s;trong Places in <HI>England,</HI> the Keys of Her Wealth, of Her Trade, and of Her Navy, have for a|bove 17 years pa&s;t been committed to three Natives of <HI>Scotland,</HI> viz. <HI>Tilbury</HI> Fort, the Guard of the Ri|ver <HI>Thames</HI> and City of <HI>London,</HI> to Colonel <HI>Saint Clare; Sheerne&s;s</HI> Fort, the Key of <HI>Chatam</HI> River and Guard of the Royal Navy, to Colonel <HI>Crawford;</HI> and <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> the greate&s;t Fortification and Magazin on the South of <HI>Britain,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Gib&s;on.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Be&s;ides, innumerable Gentlemen of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, now in Tru&s;t in the Service, Admiral <HI>Mitchel, Wi&s;hart,</HI> and Co|modore
<PB N="31" REF="38">
<HI>Ker</HI> in the Navy, with 6 or 7 Captains in the Fleet, be&s;ides Lieutenant General <HI>Steuart, Murray</HI> and <HI>Collier</HI> the Lord <HI>Portmore,</HI> his Grace the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and &s;everal o|thers I willingly omit in the Army.</P>
<P>The&s;e tru&s;ts, Gentlemen, do not favour of Partiality, and are as good Arguments to Ward again&s;t the Sugge&s;tion, as I think need to be made u&s;e of. On the other hand, there is no Que&s;tion but the Merit of the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen will alwi&s;e ren|der them valuable and u&s;eful to <HI>Britain;</HI> and as they have alwi&s;e had their &s;hare of Advancement in all Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o there is no Que&s;tion they will be more likely to obtain it now.</P>
<P>I fore&s;ee the Debate in the Parliament will have run its length, before the Printer will be plea&s;ed to let the&s;e Sheets come into the World, which makes me lay by what I had prepar'd to &s;ay about the keeping up, or di&s;&s;olving the <HI>Scots Caledonia</HI> Company.</P>
<P>I Confe&s;s, 'tis my Opinion, as I have &s;aid already, that your Company, as it was at fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;h'd, could never have been of any U&s;e to <HI>Scotland,</HI> unle&s;s by Force you had been able to have reduc'd <HI>Spain</HI> to a Nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing a Trade with your Colony in <HI>America,</HI> and all the Pro&s;pect of a Trade to <HI>India</HI> by the South-Seas, or any other way, without the Help of <HI>England,</HI> could never have An&s;wer'd for want of a Mercat for Goods, the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> being otherwi&s;e &s;upplyed.</P>
<P>But I wave entering on tho&s;e things here, the pre&s;ent Enquiry is, Why mu&s;t we lo&s;e our Company? Why mu&s;t we give up all the Privileges of the Company?</P>
<P>If I may be allow'd, without Offence, to &s;peak a little plain|ly here, perhaps it may touch the Point nearly enough.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Who is this WE, for it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="32" REF="39">
who &s;peaks; if it be We the Company, or We the Nation.</P>
<P>If you mean We the Company, the Rea&s;on is Direct, you ought to part with your Company and be thankful, and take your Money, and &s;ay you have made a good Voyage, &s;ince you recover what you had lo&s;t.&mdash;You get Principal and Intere&s;t, in a Ca&s;e where I know &s;everal of the Members would have been content to have lo&s;t all they had paid in, to have been &s;ecur'd again&s;t paying in any more.</P>
<P>Of all People in the World the&s;e are the mo&s;t Unacount|able, who have Stocks there, and can give very little Account what other things they could ever expect, but the lo&s;s of the&s;e Stocks, and yet are not for parting with their Com|pany.</P>
<P>All &s;uch People can &s;ay, is, That if an Union was to come on, and the Company to &s;tand, they might fill it with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sub&s;criptions, and make it a Rival Company in the Trade with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>&mdash;And what would <HI>Scotland</HI> Gain by that? the Trade would be entirely in <HI>England,</HI> the whole Returns there, and all the Con&s;equence would be the plea&s;ure of ruining both Companies, as would have been the certain Ca&s;e with the two Companies in <HI>England,</HI> if the plain pro&s;pect of it had not made them both Wi&s;e enough to Unite.</P>
<P>But 2<HI>dly.</HI> Let us come to the other Ca&s;e, We the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> why &s;hould We part with the Company?</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Gentlemen, any wi&s;e People will part with what would be their De&s;truction to keep.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> You cannot Unite with <HI>England,</HI> without part|ing with it, two Companies being Intolerable in <HI>Britain.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>As to the fir&s;t,&mdash;an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company ab&s;tracted from
<PB N="33" REF="40">
your Trade to <HI>England,</HI> would be the De&s;truction of all your Commerce, for two Rea&s;ons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You could export nothing but your ready Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. You would import what you could neither &s;ell in <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor carry Abroad to any Advantage.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e needs no Explication, 'tis the Complaint in <HI>England,</HI> and a Complaint not very ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd, and from whence &s;ome pretend to &s;ay, The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade is a Grievance to <HI>England, tho I do not &s;ay I am of that Mind nei|ther:</HI> But I am certain of this, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not bear the Export of their Bullion, at lea&s;t not now.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Second,</HI> 'tis evident the Import could not be vended here: And as for Foreign Markets, the <HI>Dutch</HI> are the great Staple&mdash;and what can be imagin'd you can get by them? Some Particulars indeed might be &s;old in <HI>Spain,</HI> and a little at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but far &s;hort of enough to &s;upport the Trade. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> uphold their Trade by the Strength of their Home Con&s;umpt, which is a va&s;t Gulph of Trade; and the Export again is but upon Circum&s;tances and Trifles com|par'd to the Gro&s;s; and <HI>Scotland</HI> having no Home Con&s;umpt, an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade would be ruinous to them; a <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade would involve them in a War, and a War, which I think, without reflecting at all upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> She is very un|fit to carry on, having no Naval Force to cope with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Thus either way She is in no National Capacity to carry on the Trade, or to keep up the Company; why then &s;hould She not part with it, when good Conditions are to be had for the Exchange, and all her Merchants are at liberty to Trade in the general Stock in <HI>England,</HI> as much as any Merchant there?</P>
<P N="2">2. You cannot Unite with <HI>England</HI> without parting with this Company.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41">
The Rea&s;on for this is very plain; Two Companies in <HI>England</HI> had not only almo&s;t de&s;troyed one another, but they bid fair for ruining the whole Nation, by di|viding all the Parties to one &s;ide or other; and influen|cing all Publick Affairs to their Favour, they became the very Center of all the National Divi&s;ions, and all the Factions &s;eem'd to be Incorporated into the two Companies.</P>
<P>Thus the Nation began to be Stock jobb'd into Bar|gain and Sale; and the Power of two &s;uch Rivals made even the King him&s;elf concern him&s;elf to bring them to Conditions: and the whole Nation was made unea&s;y by the Agreement, which by this time, had the Breach continued, might have embroil'd us all. This is a Rea&s;on &s;ufficient why <HI>England</HI> cannot Unite, while two <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ay &s;ome Gentlemen, with all our Hearts we dont de&s;ire they &s;hould let them let it alone.</P>
<P>Why? truly there I believe much of the Ca&s;e lyes; they that Argue for the having the <HI>African</HI> Company kept up, do it chiefly, that if po&s;&s;ible, it might be a Cheque to the &V;nion; and &s;o 'tis the &V;nion, not the Company they are Debating.</P>
<P>As to the &V;nion, Gentlemen, I avoid mentioning it as much as I can, becau&s;e &s;ome People are &s;o Chary, they will not bear to have it mentioned, and I am loth to give any Body Offence.</P>
<P>But in this Ca&s;e it cannot be helpt, <HI>England</HI> cannot &V;nite with an open Trade to <HI>India;</HI> She cannot come into the &s;ame Confu&s;ion as she was in, under two Companies before, it is Incon&s;i&s;tent with her Peace, and with her Trade, and in the End would be &s;o to yours too.</P>
<P>As to them that would not have her &V;nite, and therefore Argues about keeping the Company, I have nothing to &s;ay
<PB N="35" REF="42">
to their &V;niting, but never let them bring this as a Difficulty; for let it go what way it will, the Company can never be of any Benefit to <HI>Scotland;</HI> nor shall it be ever true, that by the Union <HI>Scotland</HI> shall not be va&s;tly Gainer.</P>
<P>Well, but &s;ays another Gentleman, What if all this be true? mu&s;t we needs Unite with you, if we do get 300000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> and all the things you talk of?&mdash;<HI>We han't a mind to &V;nite:</HI> And what then? Why &s;hould we be forc'd to it?</P>
<P>No, by no means, &s;ay I, I abhor Force; I am laying out the Advantages to Per&s;wade; if Force was to be u&s;ed, there could be no need of Per&s;wading.&mdash;God forbid I &s;hould think, much le&s;s talk of <HI>Englands</HI> Forcing <HI>Scotland</HI> to &V;nite.&mdash;And I have &s;aid my mind on that Head to your Advantage long before I thought of coming to the&s;e Parts.&mdash;Nor &s;hould I expect any Good from &s;uch a Compul|&s;ion.</P>
<P>But it is a Compul&s;ion of Rea&s;oning, <HI>Argument Con&s;trains;</HI> and &s;uch a Force there will be indeed; and you will notwith|&s;tanding all this Struggle, whether you &V;nite or no, come to &s;toop your Rea&s;on to the Force of the Thing, and hereafter, not too late, I hope, own your &s;elves Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>If you wont &V;nite, Gentlemen, I cannot help that: but in the mean time do not pretend to Rea&s;on it out of your &s;ight, for all manner of Argument is again&s;t you; And you can reject an &V;nion upon no Foot, but that of Acting again&s;t your own Light, and the Invincible Power of your own Rea|&s;on.</P>
