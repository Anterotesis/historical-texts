<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The different characters of two &s;i&s;ters.</HEAD>
<P>HARRIOT and Sophia were the daughters of a gentle|man, who, having &s;pent a good paternal inheritance before he was five and thirty, was reduced to live upon the moderate &s;alary of a place at court, which his friends procured him to get rid of his im|portunities. The &s;ame imprudence by which he had been governed in affairs of le&s;s importance, directed him
<PB N="2" REF="11">
likewi&s;e in the choice of a wife: the woman he married had no merit but beauty, and brought with her to the hou&s;e of a man who&s;e fortune was already ruined, nothing but a ta&s;te for luxury and expence, without the means of gratifying it.</P>
<P>Harriot, the elde&s;t daughter of this couple, was, like her mother, a beauty, and upon that account, as well as the conformity of her tem|per and inclinations to hers, en|gro&s;&s;ed all her affection.</P>
<P>Sophia &s;he affected to de&s;pi&s;e, be|cau&s;e &s;he wanted in an equal degree tho&s;e per&s;onal attractions, which in her opinion con&s;tituted the whole of female perfection. Mere common judges, however, allowed her per&s;on to be agreeable; people of di&s;cern|ment and ta&s;te pronounced her &s;ome|thing more. There was diffu&s;ed throughout the whole per&s;on of So|phia a certain &s;ecret charm, a natu|ral
<PB N="3" REF="12">
grace which cannot be defined; &s;he was not indeed &s;o beautiful as her &s;i&s;ter, but &s;he was more attrac|tive; her complexion was not &s;o fair as Harriot's, nor her features &s;o re|gular, but together they were full of charms: her eyes were particularly fine, large, and full of fire, but that fire tempered with a tenderne&s;s &s;o bewitching, as in&s;en&s;ibly made its way to the heart. Harriot had beauty, but Sophia had &s;omething more; &s;he had graces.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t beautiful fictions of Homer, &s;ays the celebrated <HI>Mon|te&s;quieu,</HI> is that of the girdle which gave Venus the power of plea&s;ing. Nothing is more proper to give us an idea of the magick and force of the graces, which &s;eem to be given to a per&s;on by &s;ome invi&s;ible power, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from beauty it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Harriot's charms produced at the
<PB N="4" REF="13">
fir&s;t &s;ight all the effect they were ca|pable of; a &s;econd look of Sophia was more dangerous than the fir&s;t, for grace is &s;eldomer found in the face than the manners; and, as our man|ner is formed every moment, a new &s;urpri&s;e is perpetually creating. A woman can be beautiful but one way, &s;he can be graceful a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Harriot was formed to be the ad|miration of the many; Sophia the pa&s;&s;ion of the few, the &s;weet &s;en&s;i|bility of her countenance, the pow|erful expre&s;&s;ion of her eyes, the &s;oft elegance of her &s;hape and motion, a melodious voice, who&s;e varied ac|cents enforced the &s;en&s;ible things &s;he always &s;aid, were beauties not capa|ble of &s;triking vulgar minds; and which were &s;ure to be eclip&s;ed by the dazling lu&s;tre of her &s;i&s;ter's com|plexion, and the fire of two bright eyes, who&s;e looks were as quick and un&s;ettled as her thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">While Harriot was receiving the improvement of a polite education, Sophia was left to form her&s;elf as well as &s;he could; happily for her a ju&s;t ta&s;te and &s;olid judgment &s;upplied the place of teachers, precept, and example. The hours that Harriot wa&s;ted in dre&s;s, company, and gay amu&s;ements, were by Sophia devoted to reading.</P>
<P>A good old gentleman, who was nearly related to her father, perceiv|ing this ta&s;te in her, encouraged it by his prai&s;es, and furni&s;hed her with the means of gratifying it, by con&s;tantly &s;upplying her with &s;uch books as were be&s;t calculated to im|prove her morals and under&s;tanding. His admiration encrea&s;ing in propor|tion as he had opportunities of ob|&s;erving her merit, he undertook to teach her the French and Italian lan|guages, in which &s;he &s;oon made a &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s; and by the time
<PB N="6" REF="15">
&s;he had reached her fifteenth year, &s;he had read all the be&s;t authors in them, as well as in her own.</P>
<P>By this unwearied application to reading, her mind became a beauti|ful &s;tore-hou&s;e of ideas: hence &s;he derived the power and the habit of con&s;tant reflection, which at once enlarged her under&s;tanding, and con|firmed her in the principles of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>As &s;he grew older the manage|ment of the family entirely devolved upon her; for her mother had no ta&s;te for any thing but plea&s;ure, and her &s;i&s;ter was taught to con&s;ider her|&s;elf as a fine lady, who&s;e beauty could not fail to make her fortune, and who&s;e &s;ole care it ought to be to dre&s;s to the greate&s;t advantage, and make her appearance in every place where &s;he might encrea&s;e the number of her admirers.</P>
<P>Sophia, in acquitting her&s;elf of
<PB N="7" REF="16">
the duties of a hou&s;e-keeper to her mother, &s;hewed that the highe&s;t in|tellectual improvements were not in|compatible with the humbler cares of dome&s;tic life: every thing that went through her hands received a grace and propriety from the good &s;en&s;e by which &s;he was directed; nor did her attention to family-affairs break in upon her darling amu&s;ement reading.</P>
<P>People who know how to employ their time well are good economi&s;ts of it. Sophia laid out hers in &s;uch exact proportions, that &s;he had al|ways &s;ufficient for the &s;everal em|ployments &s;he was engaged in: the bu&s;ine&s;s of her life, like that of na|ture, was performed without noi&s;e, hurry, or confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The death of Mr. Darnley threw this little family into a deplorable &s;tate of indigence, which was felt the more &s;everely, as they had hi|therto
<PB N="8" REF="17">
lived in an affluence of all things, and the debts which an ex|pence &s;o ill proportioned to their in|come had obliged Mr. Darnley to contract, left the unhappy widow and her children without any re&s;ource. The plate, furniture, and every thing valuable were &s;eized by the creditors. Mrs. Darnley and her daughters retired to a private lodg|ing, where the fir&s;t days were pa&s;&s;ed in weak de&s;pondence on the part of the mother, in pa&s;&s;ionate repinings on that of the elde&s;t daughter, and by Sophia in decent &s;orrow and pious re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley however, by a natu|ral con&s;equence of her thoughtle&s;s temper, &s;oon recovered her former gaiety. Pre&s;ent evils only were ca|pable of affecting her; reflection and foreca&s;t never di&s;turbed the &s;ettled calm of her mind. If the wants of one day were &s;upplied, &s;he did not
<PB N="9" REF="18">
con&s;ider what inconveniences the next might produce. As for Harriot &s;he found re&s;ources of comfort in the exalted ideas &s;he had of her own charms; and having already laid it down as a maxim, that poverty was the mo&s;t &s;hameful thing in the world, &s;he formed her re&s;olutions accord|ingly.</P>
<P>Sophia, as &s;oon as her grief for the lo&s;s of her father had &s;ub&s;ided, be|gan to con&s;ider of &s;ome plan for their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. She forbore how|ever to communicate her thoughts on this &s;ubject to her mother and &s;i&s;ter, who had always affected to treat every thing &s;he &s;aid with contempt, the mean di&s;gui&s;e which envy had a&s;&s;umed to hide their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her &s;uperior merit; but &s;he open|ed her mind to the good old gentle|man, to whom &s;he had been obliged for many of her improvements. She told him that being by his generous
<PB N="10" REF="19">
cares qualified to undertake the edu|cation of a young lady, &s;he was de|&s;irous of being received into the fa|mily of &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;tinction in the quality of governe&s;s to the daugh|ters of it, that &s;he might at once &s;e|cure to her&s;elf a decent e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and be enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t her mother. She hinted that if her &s;i&s;ter could be al&s;o prevailed upon to enter into the &s;ervice of a lady of quality, they might jointly contribute their endeavours to make their mo|ther's life comfortable.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert prai&s;ed her de&s;ign, and promi&s;ed to mention it to Mrs. Darnley, to whom he conceived he might &s;peak with the greater free|dom, as his near relation to her hu&s;band, and the long friend&s;hip which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, gave him a right to intere&s;t him&s;elf in their affairs. The fir&s;t words he uttered produced &s;uch an emotion in
<PB N="11" REF="20">
Mrs. Darnley's countenance, as con|vinced him that what he had farther to &s;ay would not be favourably re|ceived. She coloured, drew her&s;elf up with an air of dignity, looking at the &s;ame time at her elde&s;t daughter with a &s;cornful &s;mile.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, however, continued his di&s;cour&s;e, when Harriot, with a pertne&s;s which &s;he took for wit, interrupted him by a loud laugh, and a&s;ked him, if going to &s;ervice was the be&s;t provi&s;ion he could think of for Mr. Darnley's daughters?</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, turning ha&s;tily to her, replied with a look of great gra|vity, and in a calm accent,
<Q>Have you, mi&s;s, thought of any thing better?</Q></P>
<P>Harriot, without being di&s;concert|ed, retorted very bri&s;kly,
<Q>People who have nothing but advice to offer to their friends in di&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="12" REF="21">
ought to be &s;ilent till they are a&s;k|ed for it.</Q></P>
<P>"Good advice, Mi&s;s," replied the old gentleman with the &s;ame compo&s;ure,
<Q>is what every body cannot, and many will not give; and it is at, lea&s;t an in&s;tance of friend&s;hip to hazard it, where one may be almo&s;t &s;ure of its giving offence.</Q>
But, continued he, turn|ing to Sophia,
<Q>my young pupil here has, I hope, not profited &s;o little by her reading as to be igno|rant of the value of good coun&s;el; and I promi&s;e her &s;he &s;hall not only command the be&s;t that I am ca|pable of giving, but every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he may &s;tand in need of.</Q>
Saying this, he bowed and went away, without any attempts from Mrs. Darnley to detain him.</P>
<P>Poor Sophia, who was &s;uppo&s;ed by her &s;ilence to have acquie&s;ced in the old gentleman's propo&s;al, was ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="22">
to a thou&s;and reproaches for her meanne&s;s of &s;pirit. She attempt|ed to &s;hew the utility, and even the nece&s;&s;ity of following his advice; but &s;he found on this occa&s;ion, as &s;he had on many others, that with &s;ome per|&s;ons it is not &s;afe to be rea&s;onable. Her arguments were an&s;wered with rage and invective, which &s;oon &s;ilen|ced her, and increa&s;ed the triumph of her imperious &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, apprehen&s;ive of the ill treatment &s;he was likely to be expo&s;ed to, offered to place her in the family of a country clergyman, and to pay for her board till &s;uch a &s;ettlement as &s;he de&s;ired could be procured for her; but the tender Sophia, not willing to leave her mo|ther while &s;he could be of any u&s;e to her, gratefully declined his offer, &s;till expecting that the increa&s;ing perplexity of their circum&s;tances might bring her to reli&s;h his rea&s;on|able
<PB N="14" REF="23">
coun&s;els, and that &s;he might have the &s;anction of her con&s;ent to a &s;tep which prudence made nece&s;|&s;ary to be taken.</P>
<P>A legacy of a hundred pounds be|ing left her by a young lady who tenderly loved her, and who died in her arms, &s;he immediately pre&s;ented it to her mother, by whom it was re|ceived with a tran&s;port of joy, but without any reflection upon the filial piety of her who gave it.</P>
<P>Sophia's good friend, though he did not ab&s;olutely approve of this exalted &s;train of tenderne&s;s, yet did not fail to place the merit of it in the fulle&s;t light: but Harriot, who never heard any prai&s;es of her &s;i&s;ter without a vi&s;ible emotion, interrupted him, by &s;aying, that Sophia had only done what &s;he ought; and that &s;he her&s;elf would have acted in the &s;ame manner, if the &s;um had been twenty times larger.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24">The &s;ame delicacy which induced Sophia to dive&s;t her&s;elf of any par|ticular right to this &s;mall legacy, made her &s;ee the mi&s;application of it without di&s;covering the lea&s;t mark of di&s;like. Harriot, who governed her mother ab&s;olutely, having repre&s;ent|ed to her, that the ob&s;curity in which they lived was not the means to pre|&s;erve their old friends, or to acquire new ones, and that it was their bu|&s;ine&s;s to appear again in the world, and put them&s;elves in the way of for|tune, which could not be done with|out making a decent appearance at lea&s;t; Mrs. Darnley, who thought this rea&s;oning unan&s;werable, con|&s;ented to their changing their pre&s;ent lodgings for others more genteel, and to whatever expences her elde&s;t daughter judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of her &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Sophia lamented in &s;ecret this ex|ce&s;s of imprudence; and to avoid be|ing
<PB N="16" REF="25">
a witne&s;s of it, as well as to free her mother from the expence of her maintenance, &s;he re&s;olved to accept of the fir&s;t genteel place that offered; but the natural &s;oftne&s;s and timidity of her temper, made her delay as long as po&s;&s;ible mentioning this de&s;ign to her mother and &s;i&s;ter, le&s;t it &s;hould be con&s;trued into a tacit reproach of them for a conduct &s;o very dif|ferent.</P>
<P>Indeed her condition was greatly altered for the wor&s;e, &s;ince the pre|&s;ent &s;he had made of her legacy. Her mother and &s;i&s;ter had never loved her with any great degree of affection, and their tenderne&s;s for her was now entirely lo&s;t in the unea&s;y con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of having owed an obligation to her, for which they could not re&s;olve to be grateful. They no longer con|&s;idered her as an in&s;ignificant per&s;on who&s;e approbation or di&s;like was of no &s;ort of con&s;equence, but as a &s;aucy
<PB N="17" REF="26">
cen&s;urer of their actions, who a&s;&s;um|ed to her&s;elf a &s;uperiority, on account of the paultry a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had af|forded them: every thing &s;he &s;aid was con&s;trued into upbraidings of the benefit &s;he had conferred upon them. If &s;he offered her opinion upon any occa&s;ion, Harriot would &s;ay to her with a malicious &s;neer,
<Q>To be &s;ure you think you have a right to give us laws, becau&s;e we have had the misfortune to be obliged to you.</Q>
And Mrs. Darnley, working her&s;elf up to an agony of grief and re&s;ent|ment for the fancied in&s;ult, would lift up her eyes and cry,
<Q>How much is that mother to be pitied who lives to receive alms from her child!</Q></P>
<P>Poor Sophia u&s;ed to an&s;wer no otherwi&s;e than by tears: but this was &s;ure to aggravate her fault; for it was &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he wept and appeared afflicted only to &s;hew peo|ple
<PB N="18" REF="27">
what ungrateful returns &s;he met with for her goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus did the unhappy Sophia, with the &s;ofte&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of heart, and tendere&s;t affections, &s;ee her&s;elf excluded from the endearing te&s;ti|monies of a mother's fondne&s;s, only by being too worthy of them, and expo&s;ed to &s;hocking &s;u&s;picions of undutifulne&s;s, for an action that &s;hewed the highe&s;t filial affection: &s;o true it is, that great virtues can|not be under&s;tood by mean and little minds, and with &s;uch, not only lo&s;e all their lu&s;tre, but are too often mi&s;taken for the contrary vices.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Triumph of the Graces.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Sophia pa&s;&s;ed her time in melancholy reflecti|ons, Harriot, being by her generous gift enabled to make as &s;hewy an appearance as her mourning habit would permit, again mixed in com|pany, and laid baits for admiration. Her beauty &s;oon procured her a great number of lovers; her poverty made their approaches ea&s;y; and the weakne&s;s of her under&s;tanding, her in&s;ipid gaiety, and pert affectation of wit, encouraged the mo&s;t licentious hopes, and expo&s;ed her to the mo&s;t impertinent addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who looking upon her as a conque&s;t of no great difficul|ty formed the mortifying de&s;ign of making a mi&s;tre&s;s of her, was Sir
<PB N="20" REF="29">
Charles Stanley, a young baronet of a large e&s;tate, a mo&s;t agreeable per|&s;on, and engaging addre&s;s: his fine qualities made him the delight of all who knew him, and even envy it&s;elf allowed him to be a man of the &s;tricte&s;t honour and unblemi&s;hed in|tegrity.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who connect the idea of virtue and goodne&s;s with &s;uch a cha|racter, would find it hard to con|ceive how a man who lives in a con|&s;tant cour&s;e of di&s;&s;imulation with one part of his &s;pecies, and who abu&s;es the advantages he has received from nature and fortune, in &s;ubduing cha&s;|tity, and en&s;naring innocence, can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve, and e&s;tabli&s;h a re|putation for honour! but &s;uch are the illu&s;ions of prejudice, and &s;uch the tyranny of cu&s;tom, that he who is called a man of gallantry, is at the &s;ame time e&s;teemed a man of ho|nour, though gallantry comprehends
<PB N="21" REF="30">
the wor&s;t kind of fraud, cruelty, and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Stanley had been but too &s;ucce&s;sful in his attempts upon beauty, to fear being rejected by Mi&s;s Darnley; and knowing her &s;i|tuation, he re&s;olved to engage her gratitude at lea&s;t before he declared his de&s;igns. He had intere&s;t enough to procure the place her father en|joyed for a gentleman, who thought him&s;elf happy in obtaining it, though charged with an annuity of four&s;core pounds a year for the widow of his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, in acquainting Mi&s;s Darnley with what he had done in favour of her mother, found him&s;elf under no nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;inuating his motive for the extraordinary intere&s;t he took in the affairs of this di&s;tre&s;t family. Harriot's vanity anticipated any declaration of this &s;ort, and the thanks &s;he gave him were accompa|nied
<PB N="22" REF="31">
with &s;uch an apparent con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of the power of her charms, as convinced him his work was al|ready more than half done.</P>
<P>He was now received at Mrs. Darnley's in the quality of a declared lover of Harriot; and although a|mid&s;t all his a&s;&s;iduities he never men|tioned marriage, either the mother and daughter did not penetrate into his real de&s;igns, or were but too much di&s;po&s;ed to favour them.</P>
<P>The innocent heart of Sophia was at fir&s;t overwhelmed with joy for the happy provi&s;ion that had been made for her mother, and the pro&s;pect of &s;uch an advantageous match for her &s;i&s;ter, when Mr. Herbert, who knew the world too well to be impo&s;ed up|on by the&s;e fine appearances, gently hinted to his young favourite, his ap|prehen&s;ions of the baronet's di&s;ho|nourable views.</P>
<P>Her delicacy was &s;o &s;hocked by
<PB N="23" REF="32">
this &s;u&s;picion, that &s;he could &s;carce forbear expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome little re&s;ent|ment of it; but reflecting that this ardent lover of Harriot's had not yet made any propo&s;als of marriage, her good &s;en&s;e immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that &s;uch affected delays in a man who was ab&s;olutely indepen|dent, and with a woman who&s;e &s;itu|ation made it a point of delicacy to be early explicit on that head, could only proceed from intentions which he had not yet dared to own.</P>
<P>Chance had &s;o ordered it, that hi|therto &s;he had never &s;een Sir Charles Stanley; whenever he came, &s;he was either employed in the family affairs, or engaged with her books, which it was no ea&s;y matter to make her quit. Be&s;ides, as &s;he had no &s;hare in his vi&s;its, and as her &s;i&s;ter never &s;hewed any inclination to introduce her to him, &s;he thought it did not become her to intrude her&s;elf upon
<PB N="24" REF="33">
his acquaintance. Sir Charles indeed, knowing that Mrs. Darnley had an|other daughter, u&s;ed &s;ometimes to enquire for her, but was neither &s;ur|pri&s;ed nor di&s;appointed that &s;he never appeared.</P>
<P>Sophia, however, was determined to be in the way when he came next, that &s;he might have an oppor|tunity of ob&s;erving his behaviour to her &s;i&s;ter; and fondly flattered her|&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover nothing to the di&s;advantage of a per&s;on, whom her grateful heart had taught it&s;elf to love and e&s;teem as their common benefactor.</P>
<P>Sir Charles at the next vi&s;it found Sophia in the room with her &s;i&s;ter. He in&s;tantly &s;aw &s;omething in her looks and per&s;on which in&s;pired him with more re&s;pect than he had been u&s;ed to feel for Mrs. Darnley and Harriot; a dignity which &s;he de|rived from innate virtue, and ex|alted
<PB N="25" REF="34">
under&s;tanding. Struck with that inexplicable charm in her coun|tenance which made it impo&s;&s;ible to look on her with indifference, he began to con&s;ider her with an at|tention which greatly di&s;gu&s;ted Har|riot, who could not conceive that where &s;he was pre&s;ent any other object was worthy notice.</P>
<P>Sophia her&s;elf was a little di&s;con|certed by the young baronet's &s;o earne&s;tly gazing on her; and, in or|der to divert his looks, opened a conver&s;ation in which her &s;i&s;ter might bear a part. Then it was, that without de&s;igning it, &s;he di&s;|played her whole power of charm|ing: that flow of wit which was &s;o natural to her, the elegant pro|priety of her language, the deli|cacy of her &s;entiments, the ani|mated look which gave them new force, and &s;ent them directly to the heart, and the moving graces of
<PB N="26" REF="35">
the mo&s;t harmonious voice in the world, were attractions, which, though generally lo&s;t on fools, &s;el|dom fail of their effect on the heart of a man of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was wrapt in wonder and delight; he had no eyes, no ears, but for Sophia: he &s;carce per|ceived that Harriot was in the room.</P>
<P>The in&s;olent beauty, a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch unu&s;ual neglect, varied her at|titude and her charms a thou&s;and different ways to draw his attention; but found all was to no purpo&s;e. Had &s;he been capable of &s;erious re|flection, &s;he might now have di&s;co|vered what advantages her &s;i&s;ter, though inferior to her in beauty, gained over her, by the force of her under&s;tanding: &s;he might now have &s;een,
<Q><L>How beauty is excelled by <HI>mode&s;t</HI> grace,</L>
<L>And wi&s;dom, which alone is truly fair.</L></Q>
<PB N="27" REF="36">
But too ignorant to know her own wants, and too conceited to imagine &s;he had any, &s;he was &s;trangely perplexed how to account for &s;o &s;udden an alteration in Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Her unea&s;ine&s;s, however, grew &s;o great, that &s;he was not able to con|ceal it. She &s;hifted her &s;eat two or three times in a minute, bit her lips almo&s;t through, and frowned &s;o intelligibly, that Sophia at la&s;t perceiving her agitation, &s;uddenly recollected her&s;elf, and quitted the room upon pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When &s;he was gone, Harriot drawing her&s;elf up, and a&s;&s;uming a look which expre&s;&s;ed her confi|dence in the irre&s;i&s;tible power of her charms, &s;eemed re&s;olved to make her lover repent the little no|tice he had taken of her in this vi&s;it by playing off a thou&s;and &s;cornful airs upon him; but &s;he
<PB N="28" REF="37">
was more mortified than ever, when upon turning her eyes towards him, in full expectation of finding his fixed upon her, &s;he &s;aw them bent upon the ground, and &s;uch a pen|&s;ivene&s;s in his countenance, as all her rigors could never yet oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>She was con&s;idering what to &s;ay to him to draw him out of this re|verie, when Sir Charles, on a &s;ud|den rai&s;ing his eyes, turned them towards the door with a look of mingled anxiety and impatience, and then, as if di&s;appointed, &s;ighed and addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome indifferent con|ver&s;ation to Harriot.</P>
<P>The lady, now quite provoked, had recour&s;e to an artifice which her &s;hallow under&s;tanding &s;ugge&s;ted to her, as an infallible method of awakening his tenderne&s;s, and this was to make him jealous. With|out any preparation, therefore, &s;he
<PB N="29" REF="38">
introduced the name of Lord L&mdash;, a young nobleman who was ju&s;t re|turned from his travels, and lavi&s;h|ing a thou&s;and encomiums upon his per&s;on, and his elegant ta&s;te in dre&s;s, added,
<Q>That he was the be&s;t bred man in the world, and had entertained her &s;o agreeably one night at the play, when hap|pening to come into a box where &s;he was with a lady of her ac|quaintance, that they did not mind a word the players &s;aid, he was &s;o diverting.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles coldly an&s;wered,
<Q>That Lord L&mdash; was a very pretty youth, and that he was intimate|ly acquainted with him.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh then," cried Harriot, with a great deal of affected joy,
<Q>I vow and prote&s;t you &s;hall bring him to &s;ee me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed you mu&s;t excu&s;e me,
<PB N="30" REF="39">
madam,</Q>
&s;aid Sir Charles with &s;ome quickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Harriot, concluding her &s;tratagem had taken effect, was quite tran&s;|ported, and renewed her attacks, determined to make him &s;uffer as much as po&s;&s;ible; but the young baronet, who&s;e thoughts were full of Sophia, and who&s;e emotion at the reque&s;t Harriot had made him, was occa&s;ioned by fears very diffe|rent from tho&s;e &s;he &s;u&s;pected, took no further notice of what &s;he &s;aid, but interrupted her to a&s;k how old her &s;i&s;ter Sophia was?</P>
<P><Q>I dare engage, replied Harriot, you would never have &s;uppo&s;ed her to be younger than I am.</Q></P>
<P>The baronet &s;miled, and looking at his watch, &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed that it was &s;o late, and took his leave.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Darnley following him to the door of the room, cried,
<Q>Re|member I lay my commands up|on
<PB N="31" REF="40">
you to bring my Lord L&mdash; to &s;ee me.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles an&s;wered her no otherwi&s;e than by a low bow, and &s;he returned, delighted at the part|ing pang which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had given him. Vanity is extreme|ly ingenious in procuring gratifica|tions for it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The Young Baronet declares his Pa&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>HARRIOT did not doubt but that &s;he had tormented Sir Charles &s;ufficiently; and it was the un&s;haken confidence which &s;he had in the power of her charms, that hindered her from di&s;covering the true cau&s;e of the new di&s;gu&s;t &s;he had conceived for her &s;i&s;ter. How|ever, it was &s;o great that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;peak to her civilly, or en|dure her in her &s;ight: yet &s;he found an increa&s;e of plea&s;ure in talking to her mother when &s;he was pre&s;ent, of the violent pa&s;&s;ion Sir Charles Stanley had for her, and in giving an exaggerated account of the profe&s;&s;ions he made her.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="42">Sophia did not li&s;ten to this &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e with her u&s;ual complai|&s;ance. Her mind became in&s;en|&s;ibly more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of the baronet's pa&s;&s;ion for her &s;i&s;ter: &s;he grew pen&s;ive and me|lancholy, &s;ought &s;olitude more than ever, and loved reading le&s;s.</P>
<P>This change, which her own in|nocence hid from her&s;elf, was quickly perceived by Mr. Herbert, who loved her with a parent's fond|ne&s;s, and thought nothing indiffe|rent which concerned her. He took occa&s;ion one day to mention Sir Charles Stanley to her, and a&s;ked her opinion of his per&s;on and un|der&s;tanding, keeping his eyes fixed upon her at the &s;ame time, which di&s;concerted her &s;o much that &s;he blu&s;hed; and though &s;he com|mended him greatly, yet it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover that &s;he forbore to
<PB N="34" REF="43">
&s;ay all the good &s;he thought of him, for fear of &s;aying too much.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert no longer doubted but this dangerous youth had made an impre&s;&s;ion on the innocent heart of Sophia, which was &s;till igno|rant of its own emotions.</P>
<P>He had perceived for &s;ome time that Sir Charles had changed the object of his pur&s;uits: his vi&s;its now were always &s;hort, unle&s;s So|phia was in the way: he brought her all the new books and pam|phlets that were publi&s;hed which were worth her reading: he adopt|ed the purity and delicacy of her &s;entiments, declared him&s;elf always of the &s;ide &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed: he talk|ed of virtue like a man who loved and practi&s;ed it, and &s;et all his own good qualities in the faire&s;t light: he pre&s;ented Harriot from time to time with fa&s;hionable trifles, and &s;ent Sophia books enough to fur|ni&s;h
<PB N="35" REF="44">
out a little library, con&s;i&s;ting of the be&s;t authors, in Engli&s;h, French, and Italian, all elegantly bound, with proper ca&s;es for their reception: he prai&s;ed whatever &s;he approved, and appeared to have great re&s;pect and con&s;ideration for Mr. Herbert, becau&s;e he ob&s;erved &s;he loved and e&s;teemed him.</P>
<P>That faithful friend of the vir|tuous Sophia trembled for her dan|ger, when he con&s;idered that by this artful management the baronet was &s;trengthening him&s;elf every day in her good opinion, and &s;educing her affections under the appearance of meriting her e&s;teem; yet he did not think it proper to give her even a hint of her &s;ituation. A young maid has pa&s;&s;ed over the fir&s;t bounds of re&s;ervedne&s;s, who allows her&s;elf to think &s;he is in love.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert would not familia|rize her with &s;o dangerous an idea:
<PB N="36" REF="45">
he knew her extreme mode&s;ty, her &s;olid virtue; he was under no apprehen&s;ions that &s;he would ever act unworthy of her cha|racter; but a heart &s;o nicely &s;en|&s;ible, &s;o delicately tender as hers, he knew mu&s;t &s;uffer greatly from a di&s;appointed pa&s;&s;ion; and this was what he wanted to prevent, not by wounding her delicacy with &s;ugge&s;t|ing to her that &s;he was in love, but by pre&s;erving her from the &s;ecret encroachments of that pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He reminded her of the de&s;ign &s;he had formerly mentioned to him of entering into the &s;ervice of a lady, and was rejoiced to find that &s;he &s;till continued her re&s;olution. Harriot's natural in&s;olence and ill temper, irritated by the change &s;he now plainly &s;aw in Sir Charles, made home &s;o di&s;agreeable to So|phia, that &s;he wi&s;hed impatiently for an opportunity of providing for
<PB N="37" REF="46">
her&s;elf, that &s;he might no longer live upon the bounty of her &s;i&s;ter, who often in&s;inuated that their mo|ther's annuity was her gift.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who had other rea|&s;ons be&s;ides tho&s;e urged, from free|ing her from &s;o unea&s;y a depen|dence, promi&s;ed to be diligent in his enquiries for &s;omething that would &s;uit her.</P>
<P>Neither Mrs. Darnley nor Har|riot now oppo&s;ed this de&s;ign, which &s;oon came to the knowledge of Sir Charles, who had bribed a &s;ervant of the family to give him intelligence of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in it.</P>
<P>Impatient to prevent the execu|tion of it, and tortured by the bare apprehen&s;ion of Sophia's ab&s;ence; he re&s;olved to break through that con|&s;traint he had &s;o long laid upon him|&s;elf, and acquaint her with his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But it was not ea&s;y to find an opportunity of &s;peaking to her a|lone.
<PB N="38" REF="47">
At length having contrived to get Harriot engaged to a play, and prevailed upon a maiden kin&s;|woman of his to invite Mrs. Darn|ley to a party at whi&s;t, he went to the hou&s;e at his u&s;ual hour of vi&s;it|ing this little family, and found Sophia at home, and without any company.</P>
<P>Not all the confidence he derived from his rank and fortune, his fine under&s;tanding, and tho&s;e per&s;onal graces which gave him but too much merit in the eyes of many women, could hinder him from trembling at the thought of that declaration he was about to make.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he came into Sophia's pre&s;ence he was awed, di&s;concerted, and unable to &s;peak; &s;uch was the power of virtue, and &s;uch the force of a real pa&s;&s;ion! Two or three times he re&s;olved to begin; but when he looked upon Sophia,
<PB N="39" REF="48">
and &s;aw in her charming eyes that &s;parkling intelligence which di&s;|played the trea&s;ures of the &s;oul that animated them; when he ob&s;erved the &s;weet &s;everity of her mode&s;t countenance, the compo&s;ed dignity of her behaviour, he dur&s;t not own a pa&s;&s;ion which had views le&s;s pure than the perfect creature that in|&s;pired it.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation for near an hour was &s;o confu&s;ed, &s;o disjointed, and interrupted by &s;uch frequent mu|fings, that Sophia was amazed, and thought it &s;o di&s;agreeable, and un|like what it u&s;ed to be, that &s;he was not &s;orry when he &s;eemed di&s;|po&s;ed to put an end to his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles indeed ro&s;e up to be gone, but with &s;o deep a concern in his eyes as increa&s;ed Sophia's perplexity. She attended him re|&s;pectfully to the door of the room, when he &s;uddenly turning back,
<PB N="40" REF="49">
and taking her hand,
<Q>Do not hate me, &s;aid he, nor think ill of me, if I tell you that I love and adore you.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion at &s;uch a &s;peech, di&s;engaged her hand from his, and retiring a few &s;teps back, bent her eyes on the ground, and continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, emboldened by her confu&s;ion, made a tender, and at the &s;ame time, re&s;pectful declara|tion of the pa&s;&s;ion he had long felt for her.</P>
<P>Sophia, not willing to hear him enlarge upon this &s;ubject, rai&s;ed her eyes from the ground; her cheeks were indeed over&s;pread with blu&s;hes, but there was a grave compo&s;ure in her looks that &s;eemed a bad omen to Sir Charles.</P>
<P><Q>I have hitherto flattered my&s;elf, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, that you entertain|ed a favourable opinion of me,
<PB N="41" REF="50">
how happens it then that I &s;ee my&s;elf to-day expo&s;ed to your raillery?</Q></P>
<P>The baronet was beginning a thou&s;and prote&s;tations, but Sophia &s;topt him &s;hort.
<Q>If your pro|fe&s;&s;ions to me are &s;incere, &s;aid &s;he, what am I to think of tho&s;e you made to my &s;i&s;ter?</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles expected this retort, and was the le&s;s perplexed by it, as he needed only to follow the dic|tates of truth to form &s;uch an an|&s;wer as was proper to be given.
<Q>I acknowleged, &s;aid he, that I ad|mired your &s;i&s;ter, and her beauty made as &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, as mere beauty can make upon a man who has a ta&s;te for higher excellencies. I &s;ought Mi&s;s Darnley's acquaintance. I was &s;o happy as to do her &s;ome little &s;ervice. I wi&s;hed to find in her tho&s;e qualities that were
<PB N="42" REF="51">
nece&s;&s;ary to fix my heart&mdash;Par|don my freedom, Mi&s;s Sophia, the occa&s;ion requires that I &s;hould &s;peak freely. Mi&s;s Darnley, upon a nearer acquaintance, did not an&s;wer the idea I had formed to my&s;elf of a woman whom I could love for life; and the pro|fe&s;&s;ions I made her, as you are plea&s;ed to call them, were no more than expre&s;&s;ions of gallan|try; a &s;ort of homage which beauty, even when it does not touch the heart, exacts from the tongue. My heart was not &s;o ea&s;y a conque&s;t&mdash;tell me not of raillery, when I declare that none but your&s;elf was ever capa|ble of in&s;piring me with a real pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>The arrival of Mr. Herbert proved a grateful interruption to Sophia, in who&s;e innocent brea&s;t the tenderne&s;s and apparent &s;in|cerity
<PB N="43" REF="52">
of this declaration rai&s;ed emotions which &s;he knew not how to di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, though grieved at this un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it, yet with|drew, not wholly de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s. He had heedfully ob&s;erv|ed the changes in Sophia's face while he was &s;peaking, and thought he had rea&s;on to hope that he was not indifferent to her. Loving her as he did with exce&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s, what pure and unmixed &s;atisfaction would this thought have given him, had he not been con&s;cious that his de&s;igns were unworthy of her! The &s;ecret upbraidings of his con&s;cience di&s;quieted him amid&s;t all his flattering hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; but cu&s;tom, prejudice, the in&s;olence of fortune, and the force of example, all con&s;pired to &s;uppre&s;s the pleadings of honour and ju&s;tice in favour of the amiable

Sophia, and fixed him in the bar|barous re&s;olution of attempting to corrupt that virtue which made her &s;o worthy of his love.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> In which Harriot makes a very con|temptible Figure.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert having, as has been already mentioned, in|terrupted the conver&s;ation between Sir Charles and Sophia, was not &s;urpri&s;ed at the young baronet's ab|rupt departure, as he &s;eemed pre|paring to go when he came in; but upon looking at Sophia, he per|ceived &s;o many &s;igns of confu&s;ion and perplexity in her countenance, that he did not doubt but the di&s;|cour&s;e which his entrance had put an end to, had been a very inte|re&s;ting one. He waited a moment, in expectation that &s;he would open her&s;elf to him; but finding that &s;he continued &s;ilent and aba&s;hed, he gently took her hand, and looking
<PB N="46" REF="55">
tenderly upon her,
<Q>Tell me, my child, &s;aid he, has not &s;omething extraordinary happened, which occa&s;ions this confu&s;ion I &s;ee you in?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles has indeed been talking to me, replied Sophia blu&s;hing, in a very extraordinary manner, and &s;uch as I little ex|pected.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert pre&s;&s;ed her to ex|plain her&s;elf, and &s;he gave him an exact account of Sir Charles's di&s;|cour&s;e to her, without lo&s;ing a word; &s;o faithful had her memory been to all he had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert li&s;tened to her at|tentively, and found &s;omething &s;o like candor and &s;incerity in the ba|ronet's declaration, that he could not help being plea&s;ed with it. He had never indeed judged favourably of his views upon Harriot, but here the ca&s;e was very different.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="56">Harriot's ignorance, vanity, and eager de&s;ire of being admired, ex|po&s;ed her to the attacks of liberti|ni&s;m, and excited pre&s;umptuous hopes.</P>
<P>Sophia's good &s;en&s;e, mode&s;ty, and virtue, placed her out of the reach of temptation. No one could think it &s;urpri&s;ing that a man of &s;en&s;e &s;hould make the fortune of a woman who would do honour to his choice, and where there was &s;uch exalted merit as in Sophia, overlook the di&s;parity of circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>But ju&s;tly might it be called in|fatuation and folly, to rai&s;e to rank and affluence a woman of Harriot's de&s;picable turn; to make a com|panion for life of a hand&s;ome ideot, who thought the highe&s;t excellen|cies of the female character were to know how to dre&s;s, to dance, to &s;ing, to flutter in a drawing-room,
<PB N="48" REF="57">
or coquet at a play; who mi&s;took pertne&s;s for wit, confidence for knowledge, and in&s;olence for dignity.</P>
<P>While he was revolving the&s;e thoughts in his mind, Sophia looked earne&s;tly at him, plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve that what the baronet had &s;aid &s;eemed worthy his con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who read in her looks that &s;he wi&s;hed to have his advice on this occa&s;ion, but would not a&s;k it, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;eem to lay any &s;tre&s;s upon Sir Charles's de|claration, told her it was very po&s;&s;i|ble the baronet was &s;incere in what he had &s;aid to her; that his man|ner of accounting for his quitting her &s;i&s;ter, was both &s;en&s;ible and candid; that &s;he ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the preference he gave her over Mi&s;s Darnley, &s;ince &s;he de&s;erved it by the care &s;he had taken
<PB N="49" REF="58">
to improve her mind, and to acquire qualities which might procure the e&s;|teem of all wi&s;e and virtuous per&s;ons.</P>
<P>He warned her, however, not to tru&s;t too much to favourable ap|pearances, nor to &s;uffer her incli|nations to be &s;o far engaged by the agreeable per&s;on and &s;pecious beha|viour of Sir Charles Stanley, as to find it painful to renounce him, if he &s;hould hereafter &s;hew him&s;elf unworthy of her good opinion.</P>
<P>He advi&s;ed her, when he talked to her in the &s;ame &s;train again, to refer him to her mother and to him for an an&s;wer; and told her that he would &s;ave her the confu&s;ion and perplexity of acquainting her mo|ther and &s;i&s;ter with what had hap|pened, by taking that ta&s;k upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>You will, no doubt, added he, be expo&s;ed to &s;ome &s;allies of ill
<PB N="50" REF="59">
temper from Mi&s;s Darnley, for robbing her of a lover; for envy is more irreconcileable than hatred: but let not your &s;en&s;ibility &s;uffer much on her account; if you de|prive her of a lover, you do not deprive her of one &s;he loves: &s;he is too vain, too volatile, and too greedy of general admiration, to be affected with the lo&s;s of Sir Charles, any farther than as her pride is wounded by it: and one would imagine &s;he had fore&s;een this de&s;ertion by the pains &s;he has taken about a new conque&s;t lately.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert was going on, when Mrs. Darnley knocked at the door. Sophia in extreme agitation, begged him to &s;ay nothing concerning Sir Charles that evening. He promi&s;ed her he would not, and they all three conver&s;ed together upon indifferent
<PB N="51" REF="60">
things, until Harriot returned from the play.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert then took leave of them, after inviting him&s;elf to breakfa&s;t the next morning; which threw Sophia into &s;uch terror and confu&s;ion, that &s;he retired ha&s;tily to her own room to conceal her di&s;|order.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert came the next morning, according to his promi&s;e; and Sophia all trembling with her apprehen&s;ions retiring immediately after breakfa&s;t, he entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s that had brought him thither; but &s;en&s;ible that what he had to &s;ay would prove extremely mortifying to mi&s;s Harriot, he thought it not ami&s;s to &s;weeten the bitter bill he was preparing for her, by &s;acrificing a little flattery to her pride.</P>
<P><Q>You fine ladies, &s;aid he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her with a &s;mile, are never weary of extend|ing

Do you know, my pretty cou&s;in, that you have lo&s;t Sir Charles Stanley; and that he has offered that heart which you no doubt have de&s;pi&s;ed, to your &s;i&s;ter Sophia?</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Darnley, who had bridled up at the beginning of this &s;peech, lo&s;t all her a&s;&s;umed dignity towards the end of it: her face grew pale and red by turns; &s;he fixed her eyes on the ground, her bo&s;om heaved with the violence of her agitations, and tears, in &s;pite of her, were ready to force their way.</P>
<P>Sir Charles had indeed for a long time di&s;continued his addre&s;&s;es to her, and had &s;uffered his inclina|tion for her &s;i&s;ter to appear plainly
<PB N="53" REF="62">
enough; but &s;till her vanity &s;ug|ge&s;ted to her that this might be all a feint, and acted only with a view to alarm her fears, and oblige her to &s;acrifice all her other admirers to him.</P>
<P>What Mr. Herbert had &s;aid therefore, &s;truck her at fir&s;t with a&s;toni&s;hment and grief; but &s;olici|tous to maintain the fancied &s;uperi|ority of her character, &s;he endea|voured to repre&s;s her emotions; and taking the hint which he had de|&s;ignedly thrown out to her to &s;ave her confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles has acted very wi&s;ely, &s;aid &s;he, putting on a &s;cornful look, to quit me who al|ways de&s;pi&s;ed him, for one who has been &s;o little u&s;ed to have lovers, that &s;he will be ready to run mad with joy at the thoughts of &s;uch a conque&s;t; but, after all, &s;he has only my leavings.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="63">Mr. Herbert, though a little &s;hocked at the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of her lan|guage, replied gravely,
<Q>However that may be, Mi&s;s, it is certain that he has made a very open, and to all appearance, &s;incere declaration of love to Mi&s;s So|phia, who not knowing how to mention this affair to her mother her&s;elf, commi&s;&s;ioned me to ac|quaint her with it, that &s;he may have directions how to behave to Sir Charles, and what to &s;ay to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One would have imagined, in|terrupted Mi&s;s Darnley eagerly, that &s;he who &s;ets up for &s;o much wit, and reads &s;o many books, might have known what to &s;ay to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray, Mi&s;s, &s;aid Mr. Herbert, what would you have had her &s;ay to Sir Charles?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="64">
<Q>Why truly, replied &s;he, I think &s;he ought to have told him that he was very impertinent, and have &s;hewn him the door.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sure, Harriot, &s;aid Mrs. Darn|ley, who had been &s;ilent all this time, You forget that Sir Charles is our benefactor, and that I am obliged to him for all the little &s;upport I have.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not likely I &s;hould forget it, retorted Mi&s;s Darnley, &s;ince I am the per&s;on who am mo&s;t obliged to him for what he has done; if I mi&s;take not, it was upon my account that he in|tere&s;ted him&s;elf in our affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, well, Harriot, replied Mrs. Darnley, I have been told this often enough; but why &s;hould you be angry at this pro&s;|pect of your &s;i&s;ter's advance|ment?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="65">
<Q>I angry at her advancement, madam! exclaimed Mi&s;s Har|riot, not I really: I wi&s;h the girl was provided for by a &s;uita|ble match with all my heart; but as for Sir Charles, I would not have her &s;et her fooli&s;h heart upon him; he is only laughing at her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It may be &s;o, &s;aid Mr. Her|bert, though I think Mi&s;s Sophia the la&s;t woman in the world whom a man would chu&s;e to laugh at. However, this affair is worth a little con&s;ideration&mdash; Mi&s;s Sophia, madam, pur&s;ued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mrs. Darnley, intends to refer Sir Charles entirely to you. You will be the be&s;t judge whether the pa&s;&s;ion he profe&s;&s;es is &s;incere, and his intentions honourable; and I can an&s;wer for my young cou&s;in, that &s;he will be wholly
<PB N="57" REF="66">
governed by your advice, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible that you can give her any but what is mo&s;t advan|tageous to her honour and hap|pine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot, no longer able to &s;up|pre&s;s her rage and envy, was thrown &s;o far off her guard as to bur&s;t into tears.
<Q>I cannot bear to be thus in&s;ulted, cried &s;he; and I declare if Sir Charles is permitted to go on with his foolery with that vain girl, I will quit the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Was there ever any one &s;o un|rea&s;onable as you are, Mi&s;s, &s;aid Mr. Herbert; have you not owned that you de&s;pi&s;ed Sir Charles; and if your &s;i&s;ter is a vain girl, will &s;he not be &s;ufficiently mortified by accepting your leavings, as you &s;aid ju&s;t now?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;peaking to my mother, &s;ir, replied Harriot, with a con|temptuous frown; depend upon

it, Madam, pur&s;ued &s;he, that I will not &s;tay to be &s;acrificed to Mr. Herbert's favourite&mdash;either &s;he &s;hall be forbid to give Sir Charles any encouragement, who after all, is only laughing at her, or I will leave the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he flung out of the room, leaving her mother divided between anger and grief, and Mr. Herbert motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;h|ment.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Sir Charles, by a proper Degree of Addre&s;s and A&s;&s;urance, extricates him&s;elf from a very pre&s;&s;ing diffi|culty.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert having recovered from the a&s;toni&s;hment into which he had been thrown by the &s;trange behaviour of Mi&s;s Darnley, endeavoured to comfort her mo|ther, who&s;e weak mind was more di&s;po&s;ed to be alarmed at the threat &s;he had uttered upon her quitting the room, than to re&s;ent &s;uch an in&s;ult to parental tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>After gently in&s;inuating to her, that &s;he ought to reduce her elde&s;t daughter to rea&s;on, by a proper ex|ertion of her authority, he earne&s;t|ly recommended to her to be parti|cularly attentive to an affair which
<PB N="60" REF="69">
concerned the happine&s;s of her younge&s;t child, from who&s;e piety and good &s;en&s;e &s;he might promi&s;e her&s;elf &s;o much comfort.</P>
<P>He advi&s;ed her to give Sir Charles Stanley an opportunity of explaining him&s;elf to her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and to make him comprehend, that he mu&s;t not hope for permi&s;&s;ion to pay his addre&s;&s;es to Sophia, till he had &s;atisfied her that his intentions were &s;uch, as &s;he ought to ap|prove.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley appeared &s;o docile and complai&s;ant upon this occa|&s;ion, &s;o ready to take advice, and &s;o fully determined to be directed by it, that Mr. Herbert went away extremely well &s;atisfied with her behaviour, and full of plea&s;ing hopes for his beloved Sophia.</P>
<P>Harriot, in the mean time, was tormenting her &s;i&s;ter above &s;tairs:
<PB N="61" REF="70">
&s;he had entered her room with a heart full of bitterne&s;s, and a coun|tenance inflamed with rage, throw|ing the door after her with &s;uch violence, that Sophia letting fall her book, &s;tarted up in great terror, and, in a trembling accent, a&s;ked what was the matter with her?</P>
<P>Her own apprehen&s;ions had in|deed already &s;ugge&s;ted to her the cau&s;e of the di&s;order &s;he appeared to be in, which it was not ea&s;y to di&s;cover, in that torrent of reproach and invective with which &s;he &s;trove to overwhelm her. Scornful and unju&s;t reflections upon her per&s;on, bitter je&s;ts upon her pedantic af|fectation, and malignant in&s;inuations of hypocri&s;y, were all thrown out with the utmo&s;t incoherence of pa&s;&s;ion; to which Sophia an&s;wered no otherwi&s;e than by a provoking &s;erenity of countenance, and the mo&s;t calm attention.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71">That &s;he was able to bear with &s;uch moderation the cruel in&s;ults of her &s;i&s;ter, was not more the ef|fect of her natural &s;weetne&s;s of temper, than her good &s;en&s;e and de|licate turn of mind. The upper region of the air, &s;ays a &s;en&s;ible French writer, admits neither clouds nor tempe&s;ts; the thunder, &s;torms, and meteors, are formed below: &s;uch is the difference between a mean, and an exalted under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>Harriot, who did not find her account in this behaviour, &s;ought to rou&s;e her rage by reproaches &s;till more &s;evere, till having ineffectually railed her&s;elf out of breath, &s;he auk|wardly imitated her &s;i&s;ter's compo|&s;ure, folded her hands before her, and &s;eating her&s;elf, a&s;ked her in a low but &s;olemn tone of voice, whe|ther &s;he would deign to an&s;wer her one plain que&s;tion?</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="72">Sophia then re&s;uming her &s;eat, told her with a look of mingled dignity and &s;weetne&s;s, that &s;he was ready to an&s;wer her any que&s;tion, and give her any &s;atisfaction &s;he could de&s;ire, provided &s;he would re|pre&s;s tho&s;e indecent tran&s;ports of anger, &s;o unbecoming her &s;ex and years.</P>
<P><Q>Why, you little envious crea|ture,</Q>
&s;aid Harriot,
<Q>you do not &s;urely, becau&s;e you are two or three years younger than I am, pretend to in&s;inuate that I am old?</Q></P>
<P>"No certainly," replied Sophia, half &s;miling;
<Q>my meaning is, that you are too young to adopt, as you do, all the peevi&s;hne&s;s of old age; but your que&s;tion, &s;i&s;ter,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid Harriot,
<Q>I a&s;k you, how you have dared to &s;ay that Sir Charles Stanley was
<PB N="64" REF="73">
tired of me, and preferred you to me?</Q></P>
<P>"Tired of you!" repeated So|phia, &s;hocked at her coar&s;ene&s;s and fal&s;hood,
<Q>I never was capable of making u&s;e of &s;uch an expre&s;|&s;ion, nor do I familiarize my&s;elf with ideas that need &s;uch &s;trange language to convey them.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot, provoked almo&s;t to fren|zy by this hint, which her indi&s;|creet conduct made but too ju&s;t, flew down &s;tairs to her mother, and with mingled &s;obs and excla|mations, told her, that Sophia had treated her like an infamous crea|ture, who had di&s;honoured her&s;elf and her family.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, though more fa|vourably di&s;po&s;ed towards her young|e&s;t daughter, &s;ince &s;he had been made acquainted with the baronet's affection for her, yet was on this occa&s;ion governed by her habitual
<PB N="65" REF="74">
preference of Harriot; and &s;ending for Sophia, &s;he reproved her with great a&s;perity for her in&s;olent beha|viour to her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Sophia li&s;tened with reverence to her mother's reproofs; and after ju&s;tifying her&s;elf, as &s;he ea&s;ily might, from the accu&s;ation her &s;i&s;ter had brought again&s;t her, &s;he added, that not being willing to be expo&s;ed to any farther per&s;ecutions on account of Sir Charles Stanley, who&s;e &s;ince|rity &s;he thought very doubtful, &s;he was re&s;olved not to wait any longer for a place, &s;uch as Mr. Herbert's tenderne&s;s was in &s;earch of for her, but to accept the fir&s;t reputable one that offered.</P>
<P>"I have not the vanity, madam," pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>to imagine that a man of rank and fortune can &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olve to marry an in|digent young woman like me; and although I am humble e|nough
<PB N="66" REF="75">
to go to &s;ervice, I am too proud to li&s;ten to the addre&s;&s;es of any man who, from his &s;upe|riority of fortune, thinks he has a right to keep me in doubt of his intentions, or, in a mean de|pendance upon a re&s;olution which he has not perhaps regard enough for me to make.</Q></P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e was not all reli&s;h|ed by Mrs. Darnley, who conceived that many inconveniencies were to be &s;ubmitted to, for the enjoyment of affluence and plea&s;ure; but So|phia, who had revolved in her mind all the mortifications a young wo|man is expo&s;ed to, who&s;e poverty places her &s;o greatly below her lo|ver; that &s;he is to con&s;ider his pro|fe&s;&s;ions as an honour, and be re|joiced at every indication of his &s;incerity; her delicacy was &s;o much wounded by the bare apprehen&s;ion of &s;uffering what &s;he thought an
<PB N="67" REF="76">
indignity to her &s;ex, that &s;he was determined to give Sir Charles Stanley no encouragement, but to pur&s;ue her fir&s;t de&s;ign of &s;eeking a decent e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;uitable to the depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of her fortune.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, however, com|batted her re&s;olution with argu|ments which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive; and added to them her commands not to think any more of &s;o humiliating a de&s;ign, which &s;o offended Harriot, that &s;he broke out again into tears, exclamations, and reproaches.</P>
<P>Her mother would have found it a difficult ta&s;k to have pacified her, had not a me&s;&s;age from a lady, in|viting her to a concert that evening, obliged her to calm her mind, that her complexion might not &s;uffer from tho&s;e emotions of rage which &s;he had hitherto taken no pains to repre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="77">As &s;oon as Harriot retired, to begin the labours of the toilet, Mrs. Darnley, with great mildne&s;s, re|pre&s;ented to Sophia, that it was her duty to improve the affection Sir Charles expre&s;&s;ed for her, &s;ince by that means it might be in her power to make her mother and her &s;i&s;ter ea&s;y in their circum&s;tances, and engage their love for ever.</P>
<P>This was attacking Sophia on her weak &s;ide; &s;he an&s;wered with the &s;ofte&s;t tenderne&s;s of look and accent,
<Q>That it was her highe&s;t ambition to make them happy.</Q></P>
<P>"Then I do not doubt, my child," &s;aid Mrs. Darnley,
<Q>but you will employ all your good &s;en&s;e to &s;ecure the conque&s;t you have made.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, melted almo&s;t to tears by the&s;e tender expre&s;&s;ions, to which &s;he had been &s;o little u&s;ed, a&s;&s;ured her mother &s;he would upon this
<PB N="69" REF="78">
occa&s;ion act in &s;uch a manner as to de&s;erve her kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley would have been better plea&s;ed if &s;he had been le&s;s re&s;erved, and had appeared more affected with the fine pro&s;pect that was opening for her; but it was not po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;s her farther. Na|ture here had transferred the pa|rent's rights to the child, and the gay, imprudent, ambitious mother, &s;tood awed and aba&s;hed in the pre|&s;ence of her worthier daughter.</P>
<P>Sophia, who expected Sir Charles would renew his vi&s;it in the even|ing, pa&s;t the re&s;t of the day in unea&s;y perturbations. He entered the hou&s;e ju&s;t at the time that Har|riot, who had ordered a chair to be got for her, came fluttering down the &s;tairs in full dre&s;s. As &s;oon as &s;he perceived him, her cheeks glow|ed with re&s;entment; but affecting a carele&s;s inattention, &s;he &s;hot by him
<PB N="70" REF="79">
with a half courte&s;y, and made to|wards the door: he followed, and acco&s;ting her with a grave but re|&s;pectful air, de&s;ired &s;he would per|mit him to lead her to her chair. Harriot, conveying all the &s;corn in|to her face which the expre&s;&s;ion of her pretty but unmeaning features were capable of, and rudely draw|ing away her hand, "Pray, Sir," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>carry your <HI>devores</HI> where they will be more acceptable; I am not di&s;po&s;ed to be je&s;ted with any longer.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, half-&s;miling, and bowing low, told her, that he re|&s;pected her too much, as well upon her own account as upon Mi&s;s So|phia's, for whom indeed he had the mo&s;t tender regard, to be guilty of the impertinence &s;he accu&s;ed him of.</P>
<P>Harriot did not &s;tay to hear more: offended in the highe&s;t degree at
<PB N="71" REF="80">
the manner in which he mentioned Sophia, &s;he darted an angry look at him, and flung her&s;elf into her chair.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Sir Charles di&s;covered upon this occa|&s;ion a great &s;hare of that ea&s;y con|fidence which people are apt to de|rive from &s;plendid fortunes and un|di&s;puted rank; but as he wanted neither good &s;en&s;e, genero&s;ity, nor even delicacy, he would have found it difficult to own to a lady whom he had been u&s;ed to addre&s;s in the &s;tyle of a lover, that his heart had received a new impre&s;&s;ion, if the contemptible character of Harriot had not authorized his de&s;ertion of her. Pride, ignorance, folly, and affectation, &s;ink a woman &s;o low in the eyes of men, that they ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;e with them&s;elves from a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e delicate attentions, and re&s;pectful regards,
<PB N="72" REF="81">
which the &s;ex in general claim by the laws of politene&s;s, but which &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment never pay to the trifling part of it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was likewi&s;e glad of an opportunity to &s;hew Mi&s;s Darnley, that he did not think the little gal|lantry which had pa&s;&s;ed between them, entitled her to make him any reproaches; or to con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;ion he profe&s;&s;ed for her &s;i&s;ter as an infidelity to her; and now find|ing him&s;elf more at ea&s;e from the frank acknowledgement he had made, he &s;ent up his name, and was received by Mrs. Darnley with all the officious civility &s;he was u&s;ed to &s;hew him.</P>
<P>Sophia was in the room, and ro&s;e up at his entrance in a &s;weet con|fu&s;ion, which &s;he endeavoured to conceal, by appearing extremely bu&s;y at a piece of needle-work.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, after &s;ome trifling
<PB N="73" REF="82">
conver&s;ation with her mother, ap|proached her, and complimented her with an ea&s;y air upon her being &s;o u&s;efully employed, when mo&s;t other young ladies were abroad in &s;earch of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Sophia, who was now a little re|covered, an&s;wered him with that wit and vivacity which was &s;o na|tural to her; but looking up at the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;aw his eyes fixed upon her with a look &s;o tender and pa&s;&s;ionate, as threw her back into all her former confu&s;ion, which en|crea&s;ed every moment by the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that it was plain to his ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The young baronet, though he was charmed with her amiable mode&s;ty, yet endeavoured to relieve the concern he &s;aw her under, by talking of indifferent matters, till Mrs. Darnley &s;eeing them engaged in di&s;cour&s;e, prudently withdrew,
<PB N="74" REF="83">
when he in&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed her in language more tender and parti|cular.</P>
<P>Sophia, &s;hocked at her mother's indi&s;cretion, and at his taking ad|vantage of it &s;o abruptly, let all the weight of her re&s;entment fall on him; and the poor lover was &s;o awed by her frowns, and the &s;ar|ca&s;tic raillery which &s;he mingled with expre&s;&s;ions that &s;hewed the mo&s;t invincible indifference, that not daring to continue a di&s;cour&s;e which offended her, and in too great concern to introduce another &s;ubject, he &s;tood fixed in &s;ilence for &s;everal minutes, leaning on the back of her chair, while &s;he plied her needle with the mo&s;t earne&s;t atten|tion, and felt her confu&s;ion decrea&s;e in proportion as his became more apparent.</P>
<P>At length he walked &s;lowly to the other end of the room, and
<PB N="75" REF="84">
taking up a new book which he had &s;ent her a few days before, he a&s;ked her opinion of it in a faulter|ing accent; and was extremely mortified to find &s;he was &s;o much at ea&s;e, as to an&s;wer him with all the readine&s;s of wit and clearne&s;s of judgment imaginable.</P>
<P>Another pau&s;e of &s;ilence en&s;ued, during which Sophia heard him &s;igh &s;oftly &s;everal times, while he turned over the leaves of the book with &s;uch rapidity as &s;hewed he &s;carce read a &s;ingle line in any page of it.</P>
<P>He was thus employed when Mrs. Darnley returned, who &s;tood &s;taring fir&s;t at one, then at the other, &s;trangely perplexed at their looks and &s;ilence, and appre|hen&s;ive that all was not right. Sophia now took an opportunity to retire, and met an angry glance
<PB N="76" REF="85">
from her mother as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by her.</P>
<P>Her departure rou&s;ed Sir Charles out of his revery, he looked after her, and then turning to Mrs. Darnley, overcame his di&s;content &s;o far as to be able to entertain her a quarter of an hour with his u&s;ual politene&s;s; and finding So|phia did not appear again he took his leave.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone Mrs. Darnley called her daughter, and chid her &s;everely for her rudene&s;s in leaving the baronet.</P>
<P>Sophia defended her&s;elf as well as &s;he could, without owning the true cau&s;e of her di&s;gu&s;t, which was her mother's &s;o offi|ciou&s;ly quitting the room; but Mrs. Darnley was &s;o ill &s;atisfied with her behaviour, that &s;he complained of it to her friend
<PB N="77" REF="86">
Mr. Herbert, who came in &s;oon afterwards, telling him that So|phia's pride and ill temper would be the ruin of her fortune.</P>
<P>The good man having heard the &s;tory but one way, thought Sophia a little to blame, till hav|ing an opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e with her freely, he found the fault &s;he had been charged with was no more than an exce&s;s of de|licacy, which was very pardon|able in her &s;ituation: he warned her, however, not to admit too readily apprehen&s;ions injurious to her&s;elf, which was in &s;ome de|gree deba&s;ing the dignity of her &s;ex and character; but to make the baronet comprehend that e&s;|teeming him as a man of honour, &s;he con&s;idered his profe&s;&s;ions of regard to her as a claim upon her gratitude; and that, in con|&s;equence
<PB N="78" REF="87">

<P>POOR Sophia found her&s;elf but too well di&s;po&s;ed to think fa|vourably of Sir Charles; her ten|derne&s;s had &s;uffered greatly by the force &s;he had put upon her&s;elf to behave to him in &s;o di&s;obliging a manner, and the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;aw him under, his &s;ilence, and con|fu&s;ion, and the &s;ighs that e&s;caped him, apparently without de&s;ign, had affected her &s;en&s;ibly, and &s;everal days pa&s;&s;ing away without his ap|pearing again, &s;he concluded he was irrecoverably prejudiced again&s;t her; the unea&s;ine&s;s this thought gave her, fir&s;t hinted to her&s;elf the im|pre&s;&s;ion he had already made on her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="89">Sir Charles indeed has been &s;o much piqued by her behaviour as to form the re&s;olution of &s;eeing her no more; but when he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf mo&s;t capable of per&s;i&s;ting in this re&s;olution, he was neare&s;t breaking through it, and &s;uddenly yielding to the impul&s;e of his ten|derne&s;s, he flew to her again more pa&s;&s;ionate than ever; this little ab|&s;ence having only &s;erved to &s;hew him how nece&s;&s;ary &s;he was to his happine&s;s. When Sophia &s;aw him enter the room, the agitations of her mind might be ea&s;ily read in her artle&s;s countenance; a &s;entiment of joy for his return gave new fire to her eyes, and vivacity to her whole per&s;on; while a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of the effect his pre&s;ence pro|duced, and a painful doubt of his &s;incerity, and the rectitude of his intentions, alternately dyed her cheeks with blu&s;hes and palene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="90">The young baronet approached her trembling; but the unexpected &s;oftne&s;s with which &s;he received him, increa&s;ing at once his pa&s;&s;ion and his hopes, he poured out his whole &s;oul in the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t ardent profe&s;&s;ions of love, e&s;teem, and admiration of her.</P>
<P>Sophia li&s;tened to him with a complai&s;ant attention; and having had &s;ufficient time, while he was &s;peaking, to compo&s;e and recollect her&s;elf, &s;he told him in a mode&s;t but firm accent, that &s;he was obliged to him for the favourable opinion he entertained of her; but that &s;he did not think her&s;elf at liberty to hear, much le&s;s to an&s;wer to &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e as he had thought proper to addre&s;s to her, till &s;he had the &s;anction of her mother's con&s;ent, and Mr. Herbert's appro|bation, who&s;e truly parental regard
<PB N="82" REF="91">
for her, made her look upon him as another father, who &s;upplied the place of him &s;he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, more charmed with her than ever, was ready in his pre&s;ent flow of tender &s;entiments for her, to offer her his hand with an unre&s;ervedne&s;s that would have &s;atisfied all her delicate &s;cruples; but carried away by the force of habit, an in&s;urmountable aver&s;ion to marriage, and the fal&s;e but &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed notion of refine|ments in an union of hearts, where love was the only tye, he could not re&s;olve to give her a proof of his affection, which in his opinion was the likelie&s;t way to de&s;troy all the ardor of it; but careful not to alarm her, and apprehending no great &s;everity of morals from the gay intere&s;ted mother, he politely thanked her for the liberty &s;he gave
<PB N="83" REF="92">
him to make his pa&s;&s;ion known to Mrs. Darnley, and to &s;olicit her con&s;ent to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sophia ob&s;erved with &s;ome con|cern, that he affected to take no notice of Mr. Herbert upon this occa&s;ion; but &s;he would not allow her&s;elf to dwell long upon a thought &s;o capable of rai&s;ing doubts inju|rious to his honour; and &s;atisfied with the frankne&s;s of his proceed|ing thus far, &s;he &s;uffered no marks of di&s;content or apprehen&s;ion to appear in her countenance and be|haviour.</P>
<P>Sir Charles did not &s;ail to make &s;uch a general declaration of his &s;entiments to Mrs. Darnley as he thought &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy Sophia, without obliging him&s;elf to be more explicite; and in the mean time, having acquired a thorough know|ledge of Mrs. Darnley's character, he &s;ought to engage her in his in|tere&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="93">
by a boundle&s;s liberality, and by gratifying all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which make corruption ea&s;y. She loved di&s;&s;ipation; and all the plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements that inventive luxury had found out to vary the &s;hort &s;cene of life were at her com|mand; &s;he had a high ta&s;te for the plea&s;ures of the table, and therefore the mo&s;t expen&s;ive wines, and choice&s;t delicacies that earth, &s;ea, and air could afford, were con&s;tant|ly &s;upplied by him in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion. No day ever pa&s;&s;ed without her receiving &s;ome con&s;i|derable pre&s;ent, the value of which was inhanced by the delicacy with which it was made.</P>
<P>The innocent Sophia con&s;trued all this munificence into proofs of the &s;incerity of his affection for her; for the young baronet, whe|ther awed by the dignity of her virtue, or that he judged it nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="85" REF="94">
to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of his de|&s;igns, mingled with the ardor of his profe&s;&s;ions a behaviour &s;o re|&s;pectful and delicate, as removed all her apprehen&s;ions, and left her whole &s;oul free to all the tender impre&s;&s;ions a lively gratitude could make on it.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, however, ea&s;ily penetrated into Sir Charles's views; he &s;aw with pain the progre&s;s he made every day in the affection of Sophia; but, by the &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of his conduct, he had e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o firmly in her good opi|nion, that he judged any attempt to alarm her fears, while there &s;eemed &s;o little foundation for them, would mi&s;s its effect; and not doubting but ere it was long her own ob&s;ervation would furni&s;h her with &s;ome cau&s;e for apprehen|&s;ion, he contented him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent with keeping a vigilant eye
<PB N="86" REF="95">
upon the conduct of Sir Charles and Mrs. Darnley, and with being ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t Sophia in her per|plexities, whenever &s;he had recour&s;e to him.</P>
<P>The change there was now in the &s;ituation of this amiable girl, afforded him many opportunities of admiring the excellence of her character: &s;he who formerly u&s;ed to be treated with neglect and even har&s;hne&s;s by her mother, was now di&s;tingui&s;hed with peculiar regard; her opinion always &s;ubmitted to with deference, her inclinations con&s;ulted in all things, and a &s;tu|dious endeavour to plea&s;e her was to be &s;een in every word and action of Mrs. Darnley's, who af|fected to be as partially fond of her as &s;he had once been of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Even the haughty in&s;olent Har|riot, keeping her rage and envy con|cealed
<PB N="87" REF="96">
in her own brea&s;t, conde|&s;cended to wear the appearance of kindne&s;s to her, while &s;he &s;hared with her mother in all tho&s;e grati|fications which the lavi&s;h genero|&s;ity of Sir Charles procured them, and which Sophia, &s;till continuing her u&s;ual &s;implicity of life, could never be per&s;uaded to partake of. Yet all this produced no altera|tion in Sophia; the &s;ame mode&s;ty and humility, the &s;ame &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and attention to oblige, di&s;tingui&s;hed her now as in her days of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert contemplated her with admiration and delight, and often with a&s;toni&s;hment reflected upon the infatuation of Sir Charles, who could allow him&s;elf to be &s;o far governed by fa&s;hionable preju|dices, and a libertine turn of mind, as to balance one moment whether he &s;hould give him&s;elf a lawful
<PB N="88" REF="97">
claim to the affections of &s;uch a woman.</P>
<P>Affairs continued in this &s;tate during three months, when the good old man, who watched over his young favourite with all the pious &s;olicitude of her guardian angel, perceived that &s;he was grown more melancholy and re&s;erved than u&s;ual; he often heard her &s;igh, and fancied &s;he had been weeping, and her fine eyes would appear &s;ome|times &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, even when &s;he endeavoured to appear mo&s;t chearful.</P>
<P>He imagined that &s;he had &s;ome|thing upon her mind which &s;he wi&s;hed to di&s;clo&s;e to him; her looks &s;eemed to intimate as much, and &s;he frequently &s;ought opportunities of being alone with him, and en|gaged him to pa&s;s tho&s;e evenings with her, when her mother and &s;i&s;ter were at any of the public en|tertainments.
<PB N="89" REF="98">
Yet all tho&s;e times, though her heart &s;eemed labouring with &s;ome &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he would fain impart to him, &s;he had not re&s;olution enough to enter into any explanation.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who could have wi&s;hed &s;he had been more commu|nicative, re&s;olved at length to &s;pare her any farther &s;truggles with her|&s;elf; and one day when he was alone with her, taking occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that &s;he was not &s;o chearful as u&s;ual, he a&s;ked her tenderly if any thing had happened to give her unea&s;ine&s;s; "Speak freely my child," &s;aid he to her,
<Q>and think you are &s;peaking to a father.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia made no other an&s;wer at fir&s;t than by bur&s;ting into tears, which &s;eeming to relieve her a little, &s;he rai&s;ed her head, and looking upon the good man, who beheld her with a fixed attention,
<PB N="90" REF="99">
"May I hope, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>that you are &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to fulfil the kind promi&s;e you once made me &mdash;Oh take me from hence,</Q>
pur|&s;ued &s;he, relap&s;ing into a new pa&s;&s;ion of tears,
<Q>place me in the &s;ituation to which my humble lot has called me; &s;ave me from the weakne&s;s of my own heart&mdash;I now &s;ee plainly the delu&s;ion into which I have fallen; but, alas! my mother does not &s;ee it&mdash; every thing here con&s;pires again&s;t my peace.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Sophia takes a very extraordinary re|&s;olution. Mr. Herbert encourages her in it.</HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA, as if afraid &s;he had &s;aid too much, &s;topped abrupt|ly, and, fixing her eyes on the ground, continued &s;ilent, and lo&s;t in thought.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who had well con|&s;idered the purport of her words, pa&s;&s;ed over what he thought would give her too much pain to be ex|plicit upon, and an&s;wered in great concern,
<Q>Then my fears are true! Sir Charles is not di&s;po&s;ed to act like a man of honour.</Q></P>
<P>A &s;udden blu&s;h glowed in the cheeks of Sophia at the mention of Sir Charles's name; but it was not a blu&s;h of &s;oftne&s;s and confu&s;ion.
<PB N="92" REF="101">
Anger and di&s;dain took the place of that &s;weet complacency, which was the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion of her counte|nance, and with a voice &s;omewhat rai&s;ed, &s;he replied eagerly,</P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles I believe has de|ceived me; but him I can de|&s;pi&s;e&mdash;Yet do not imagine, Sir, that he has dared to in&s;ult me by any unworthy propo&s;als: if he has any unju&s;tifiable views upon me, he has not had pre&s;umption enough to make me acquainted with them, otherwi&s;e than by neglecting to convince me that they are honourable; but he practi&s;es upon the ea&s;y credulity of my mother. He lays &s;nares for her gratitude by an intere&s;ted genero&s;ity, as I now too plainly perceive; and he has the art to make her &s;o much his friend, that &s;he will not li&s;ten to any
<PB N="93" REF="102">
thing I &s;ay, which implies the lea&s;t doubt of his honour.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert &s;ighed, and ca&s;t down his eyes. Sophia continued in great emotion:
<Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me, Sir, to make you comprehend all the difficulties of my &s;ituation. A man who takes every form to en&s;nare my affections, but none to convince my judgment, impor|tunes me continually with decla|rations of tenderne&s;s, and com|plaints of my coldne&s;s and indif|ference: what can I do? what ought I to an&s;wer to &s;uch di&s;|cour&s;e? In this perplexity, why will not my mother come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance? her years, her autho|rity as a parent, give her a right to require &s;uch an explanation from Sir Charles as may free me from doubts, which although rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts, delicacy permits
<PB N="94" REF="103">
me not to make appear; but &s;uch is my misfortune, that I cannot per&s;uade my mother there is the lea&s;t foundation for my fears. She is ob&s;tinate in her good opinion of Sir Charles; and I am reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of either acting in open contra|diction to her &s;entiments and commands, or of continuing in a &s;tate of humiliating &s;u&s;pence, to which my character mu&s;t at la&s;t fall a &s;acrifice.</Q></P>
<P>"That, my dear child," inter|rupted Mr. Herbert,
<Q>is a point which ought to be con&s;idered. I would not mention it to you fir&s;t; but &s;ince your own good &s;en&s;e has led the way to it, I will frankly own that I am afraid, innocent and good as you are, the cen&s;ures of the world will not &s;pare you, if you continue to receive Sir Charles's vi&s;its, doubt|ful
<PB N="95" REF="104">
as his intentions now appear to every one: I know Mrs. Darnley judges of the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions to you, by the genero&s;ity he has &s;hewn in the pre&s;ents he has heaped upon her: &mdash;but, my dear child, that ge|nero&s;ity was always &s;u&s;pected by me.</Q></P>
<P>"I confe&s;s," &s;aid Sophia, blu&s;h|ing,
<Q>I once thought favourably of him, for the attention he &s;hew|ed to make my mother's life ea&s;y; but if his liberality to her be in|deed, as you &s;eem to think, a &s;nare, what opinion ought I to form of his motives for a late offer he has made her, and which at fir&s;t dazzled me, &s;o noble and &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted did it appear!</Q></P>
<P>"I know no offer but one," interrupted Mr. Herbert ha&s;tily,
<Q>which you ought even to have li&s;tened to.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="105">
<Q>Then the &s;ecret admonitions of my heart were right!</Q>
cried Sophia with an accent that at once expre&s;&s;ed exultation and grief.</P>
<P><Q>But what was this offer, child,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Herbert?
<Q>I am impatient to know it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will tell you the whole affair as it happened,</Q>
re&s;umed Sophia;
<Q>but you mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that my mother was plea&s;ed with Sir Charles's offer. He has been her benefactor, and has a claim to her regard: it would be &s;trange if &s;he had not a good opinion of him. You know what that celebrated divine &s;ays, who&s;e writings you have made me acquainted with: <HI>Charity it|&s;elf commands us where we know no ill, to think well of all; but friend&s;hip, that goes always a pitch higher, gives a man a peculiar right and claim to the good opi|nion
<PB N="97" REF="106">
of his friend.</HI> My mother may be mi&s;taken in the judg|ment &s;he has formed of Sir Charles; but it is her friend&s;hip for him, a friend&s;hip founded upon gratitude for the good offi|ces he has done her, that has given ri&s;e to this mi&s;take.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, in her eagerne&s;s to ju&s;tify her mother, forgot that &s;he had rai&s;ed Mr. Herbert's curio&s;ity, and left it un&s;atisfied; and the good old man, charmed with the filial ten|derne&s;s &s;he &s;hewed upon this occa|&s;ion, li&s;tened to her with compla|cency, though not with conviction. At length &s;he &s;uddenly recollected her&s;elf, and entered upon her &s;tory; but a certain he&s;itation in her &s;peech, accompanied with a ba&s;hful air that made her withdraw her eyes from him, to fix them upon the ground, intimated plainly enough her own &s;entiments of the
<PB N="98" REF="107">
affair &s;he was going to acquaint him with.</P>
<P>"You know, Sir," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>Sir Charles has had a fit of ill|ne&s;s lately, which alarmed all his friends. My mother was parti|cularly attentive to him upon this occa&s;ion, and I believe he was &s;en&s;ibly affected with her kind concern for him. When he recovered, he begged my mo|ther, my &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf, would accompany him in a little excur&s;ion to Hamp&s;tead to take the air. We dined there, and returning home early in the evening, as we pa&s;&s;ed through Brook-&s;treet, he ordered the coach to &s;top at the door of a very genteel hou&s;e, which ap|peared to be newly painted and fitted up. Sir Charles de&s;ired us to go in with him and look at it, and give him our opinion of the
<PB N="99" REF="108">
furniture. Nothing could be more elegant and genteel, and we told him &s;o; at which he ap|peared extremely plea&s;ed, for all had been done, he &s;aid, accord|ing to his directions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He came home with us, and drank tea; after which he had a private conver&s;ation with my mother, which la&s;ted about a quarter of an hour; and when they returned to the room where they had left my &s;i&s;ter and I, Sir Charles appeared to me to have an unu&s;ual thought|fulne&s;s in his countenance, and my mother looked as if &s;he had been weeping; yet there was at the &s;ame time, an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfaction in her face.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He went away immediately, when my mother, eager to give vent to the emotions which filled
<PB N="100" REF="109">
her heart, exclaimed, Oh, So|phia, how much are you obliged to the generous affection of that man!</Q></P>
<P>"You may imagine, Sir," pur|&s;ued Sophia, in a &s;weet confu&s;ion,
<Q>that I was greatly affected with the&s;e words. I begged my mo|ther to explain her&s;elf. Sir Charles,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>has made you a pre&s;ent of that hou&s;e which we went to view this af|ternoon; and here,</Q>
added &s;he, giving me a paper,
<Q>is a deed by which he has &s;ettled three hun|dred pounds a year upon you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was &s;ilent, &s;o was my &s;i&s;ter, who looked at me as if impatient to know my thoughts of this extraordinary genero&s;ity. My thoughts indeed were &s;o perplex|ed, my notions of this manner of acting &s;o confu&s;ed and uncer|tain, that I knew not what to
<PB N="101" REF="110">
&s;ay. My mother told us Sir Charles had declared to her, that his late illne&s;s had given him oc|ca&s;ion for many unea&s;y reflections upon my account; that he &s;hud|dered with horror when he con|&s;idered the unhappy &s;tate of my fortune, and to what difficulties I &s;hould have been expo&s;ed if he had died; and that, for the &s;a|tisfaction of his own mind, he had made that &s;ettlement upon me, that whatever happened I might be out of the reach of ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>"I am afraid, Sir," pur&s;ued So|phia with a little confu&s;ion in her countenance,
<Q>that you will con|demn me when I tell you I was &s;o &s;truck at fir&s;t with the &s;eem|ing candor and tenderne&s;s of Sir Charles's motives for this act of genero&s;ity, that none but the mo&s;t
<PB N="102" REF="111">
grateful &s;entiments ro&s;e in my mind.</Q></P>
<P>"No, my dear," replied Mr. Herbert,
<Q>I do not condemn you: this &s;nare was artfully laid; but when was it that your heart, or rather your rea&s;on, gave you tho&s;e &s;ecret admonitions you &s;poke of?</Q></P>
<P>"Immediately," &s;aid Sophia:
<Q>a moment's reflection upon the conduct of Sir Charles &s;erved to &s;hew me that &s;ome latent de&s;ign lay concealed under this &s;pecious offer; but I am obliged to my &s;i&s;ter for giving me a more di&s;tinct notion of it than my own confu&s;ed ideas could furni&s;h me with.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then you de&s;ired to know her opinion,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Herbert.</P>
<P>"Certainly," re&s;umed Sophia,
<Q>this conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed in her
<PB N="103" REF="112">
pre&s;ence, and as my elder &s;i&s;ter &s;he had a right to be con|&s;ulted.</Q></P>
<P>"Pray what did &s;he &s;ay?" a&s;ked Mr. Herbert impatiently.</P>
<P>"You know, Sir," &s;aid Sophia, with a gentle &s;mile,
<Q>my &s;i&s;ter takes every opportunity to rally me about my preten&s;ions to wit: &s;he told me it was great conde|&s;cen&s;ion in me, who thought my|&s;elf wi&s;er than all the world be|&s;ides, to a&s;k her advice upon this occa&s;ion; and that &s;he would not expo&s;e her&s;elf to my con|tempt, by declaring her opinion, any farther than that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Sir Charles did not con&s;ider this as a marriage-&s;ettlement.</Q></P>
<P>"The&s;e la&s;t words," pur&s;ued So|phia, who&s;e face was now covered with a deeper blu&s;h,
<Q>let in &s;o much light upon my mind, that I was a&s;hamed and angry with my&s;elf
<PB N="104" REF="113">
for having doubted a moment of Sir Charles's in&s;incerity. I thank|ed my &s;i&s;ter, and told her &s;he &s;hould &s;ee that I would profit by the hint &s;he had given me.</Q></P>
<P>"I wi&s;h," interrupted Mr. Her|bert,
<Q>that &s;he may profit as much by you: but people of good un|der&s;tanding learn more from the ignorant than the ignorant do from them, becau&s;e the wi&s;e avoid the follies of fools, but fools will not follow the example of the wi&s;e: but what did Mrs. Darnley &s;ay to this?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I never &s;aw her &s;o angry with my &s;i&s;ter before,</Q>
replied Sophia:
<Q>&s;he &s;aid &s;everal &s;evere things to her, which made her leave the room in great emotion; and when we were alone, I endeavoured to con|vince my mother that it was not fit I &s;hould make my&s;elf a de|pendant upon Sir Charles, by ac|cepting
<PB N="105" REF="114">
&s;uch con&s;iderable pre|&s;ents: &s;he was, however, of a different opinion, becau&s;e Sir Charles's behaviour had been al|ways re&s;pectful in the highe&s;t de|gree to me, and becau&s;e the man|ner in which he made this offer, left no room to &s;u&s;pect that he had any other de&s;ign in it but to &s;ecure a provi&s;ion for me, in ca&s;e any thing &s;hould happen to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your mother impo&s;es upon her|&s;elf,</Q>
replied Mr. Herbert;
<Q>but I hope, my dear child, you think more ju&s;tly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may judge of my &s;enti|ments, Sir,</Q>
an&s;wered Sophia,
<Q>by the re&s;olution I have taken: I wi&s;hed to con&s;ult you; but as I had no opportunity for it, I &s;atis|fied my&s;elf with doing what I thought you would approve. My mother, pre&s;t by my argu|ments,
<PB N="106" REF="115">
told me in a peevi&s;h way that I might act as I thought proper: upon which I retired, and, &s;atisfied with this permi&s;|&s;ion, I enclo&s;ed the &s;ettlement in a cover directed to Sir Charles. I had ju&s;t &s;ealed it, and was going to &s;end it away, when my mother came into my room: I perceived &s;he was de&s;irous to renew the conver&s;ation about Sir Charles; but I carefully avoided it, for fear &s;he &s;hould re|tract the permi&s;&s;ion &s;he had given me to act as I plea&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion. My re&s;erve piqued her &s;o much, that &s;he forbore to enter upon the &s;ubject again; but as I had no opportunity of &s;ending any letter that night without her knowledge, I was obliged to go to bed much richer than I de&s;ired to be; and the next morning, when we were at

breakfa&s;t, a letter was brought me from Sir Charles, dated four o'clock, in which he informed me that he was ju&s;t &s;etting out in a po&s;t-chai&s;e for Bath. His uncle, who lies there at the point of death, has it &s;eems earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to &s;ee him, and the me&s;&s;en|ger told him he had not a minute to lo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>"I am &s;orry," interrupted Mr. Herbert,
<Q>that he did not get your letter before he went.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia then taking it out of her pocket, gave it to him, and begged he would contrive &s;ome way to have it &s;afely delivered to Sir Charles;
<Q>and now, added &s;he, my heart is ea&s;y on that &s;ide, and I have no|thing to do but to arm my&s;elf with fortitude to bear the ten|der reproaches of a mother, who&s;e anxiety for my intere&s;t makes her &s;ee this affair in a very

different light from that in which you and I behold it.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert put the letter care|fully into his pocket-book, and pro|mi&s;ed her it &s;hould be conveyed to Sir Charles; then taking her hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed affectionately,
<Q>You have another &s;acrifice yet to make, my dear good child,</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q>and I hope it will not co&s;t you much to make it. You mu&s;t re&s;olve to &s;ee Sir Charles no more: it is not fit you &s;hould receive his vi&s;its, &s;ince you &s;u&s;pect his de|&s;igns are not honourable, and you have but too much cau&s;e for &s;u&s;picion. It is not enough to be virtuous: we mu&s;t appear &s;o likewi&s;e; we owe the world a good example, the world, which oftener rewards the appearances of merit, than merit it&s;elf. It will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to avoid &s;eeing Sir Charles &s;ome|times,

His wife and daughters will be agreeable com|panions for you; you will find books enough in his &s;tudy to em|ploy tho&s;e hours which you de|vote to reading, and his conver|&s;ation will be always a &s;ource of in&s;truction and delight.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, with tears in her eyes, and a look &s;o expre&s;&s;ive that it con|veyed a &s;tronger idea of the grateful &s;entiments which filled her heart, than any words could do, thanked the good old man for his generous offer, and told him &s;he was ready to

leave London whenever he plea&s;ed: but unwilling to be an incumbrance upon his little fortune, &s;he intreated him to be diligent in his enquiries for a place for her, that &s;he might early inure her&s;elf to the humble condition which Providence thought fit to allot for her.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, entering into her delicate &s;cruples, promi&s;ed to pro|cure her a proper e&s;tabli&s;hment; and it was agreed between them that he &s;hould acquaint her mother the next day with the re&s;olution the had taken, and endeavour to pro|cure her con&s;ent to it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Mr. Herbert and Sophia carry their Point with great Difficulty.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Herbert well knew all the difficulties of this ta&s;k, and prepared him&s;elf to &s;u&s;tain the &s;torm which he expected would fall upon him. He vi&s;ited Mrs. Darn|ley in the morning, and finding her alone, entered at once into the affair, by telling her that he had performed the commi&s;&s;ion Mi&s;s Sophia had given him; that a friend of his who was going to Bath would take care to deliver her letter to her unworthy lover, who, added he, will be convinced, by her re|turning his &s;ettlement, that &s;he has a ju&s;t notion of his ba&s;e de&s;igns, and de&s;pi&s;es him as well for his fal&s;hood and pre&s;umption, as for
<PB N="112" REF="121">
the mean opinion he has entertained of her.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, who was perfectly well acquainted with Mrs. Darnley's character, and had &s;tu|died his part, would not give her time to recover from the a&s;toni&s;h|ment his fir&s;t words had thrown her into, which was &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed upon her countenance, and which &s;eemed to deprive her of the power of &s;peech; but added, with an air natural enough,
<Q>Your con|duct, Mrs. Darnley, de&s;erves the highe&s;t prai&s;es; indeed I know not which to admire mo&s;t, your di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, prudence, and judgment; or Mi&s;s Sophia's rea|dy obedience, and the noble &s;a|crifice &s;he makes to her honour and reputation. You knew her virtue might be &s;ecurely depend|ed upon, and you permitted her to act as &s;he thought proper with
<PB N="113" REF="122">
regard to the in&s;idious offer Sir Charles made her: thus, by trans|ferring all the merit of a refu&s;al to her, you reflect a double lu&s;tre upon your own, and &s;he has fully an&s;wered your intentions by re|jecting that offer with the con|tempt it de&s;erved.</Q></P>
<P>While Mr. Herbert went on in this &s;train, Mrs. Darnley in&s;en&s;ibly forgot her re&s;entment; her features a&s;&s;umed all that complacency which gratified vanity and &s;elf-applau&s;e could impre&s;s upon them: and al|though &s;he was con&s;cious her &s;en|timents were very different from tho&s;e which Mr. Herbert attributed to her, yet, as &s;he had really &s;poke tho&s;e words to Sophia which had given her a pretence to act as &s;he had done, &s;he concluded his prai&s;es were &s;incere, and enjoyed them as much as if &s;he had de&s;erved them.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="123">It was her bu&s;ine&s;s now, how|ever vexed at her daughter's folly, as &s;he conceived it, to &s;eem highly &s;atisfied with her conduct, &s;ince what &s;he had done could not be recalled; yet inwardly fretting at the lo&s;s of &s;o noble a pre&s;ent, all her di&s;&s;imulation could not hinder her from &s;aying, that although &s;he approved of Sophia's refu&s;al, yet &s;he could not help thinking &s;he had been very precipitate, and that &s;he ought to have waited till Sir Charles returned; and not have &s;ent, but have given him back his &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, without an&s;wering to that point, told her, that what now remained for her prudence to do was, to take away all founda|tion for &s;lander, by peremptorily forbidding Sir Charles's future vi|&s;its; (here Mrs. Darnley began to frown)
<Q>for &s;ince it is plain to us
<PB N="115" REF="124">
all, madam,</Q>
pur&s;ued he, with|out &s;eeming to perceive her emo|tion,
<Q>that marriage is not his in|tention, by being allowed to continue his addre&s;&s;es, mi&s;s So|phia's character will &s;uffer great|ly in the opinion of the world; and the wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion by which you have hitherto been governed in this affair, will not &s;ecure you from very unfavour|able cen&s;ures. To &s;hew there|fore how much you are in earne&s;t to prevent them, I think it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould &s;end your daughter out of this man's way.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, who thought &s;he had an unan&s;werable objection to make to this &s;cheme, in|terrupted him eagerly,
<Q>You know my circum&s;tances, Mr. Herbert, you know I cannot af|ford to &s;end my daughter from
<PB N="116" REF="125">
me; how am I to di&s;po&s;e of her, pray?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let not that care trouble you, madam,</Q>
replied Mr. Herbert,
<Q>I will take all this expence upon my&s;elf: I love Mi&s;s Sophia as well as if &s;he was my own child; and &s;lender as my income is, I will be at the charge of her maintenance till fortune and her own merit place her in a better &s;ituation.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert then acquainted her with the name and character of the clergyman in who&s;e family he in|tended to place Sophia: he added, that the village to which &s;he was going being at no great di&s;tance, &s;he might hear from her frequent|ly, and &s;ometimes vi&s;it her, without much expence or inconvenience.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley having nothing that was rea&s;onable to oppo&s;e to the&s;e kind and generous offers, had
<PB N="117" REF="126">
recour&s;e to rage and exclamation. She told Mr. Herbert that he had no right to interpo&s;e in the affairs of her family; that he &s;hould not di&s;po&s;e of her daughter as he plea&s;|ed; that &s;he would exert the au|thority of a parent, and no officious meddler &s;hould rob her of her child.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert now found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to change his method with this intere&s;ted mother,
<Q>Take care, madam,</Q>
&s;aid he, with a &s;evere look,
<Q>how far you carry your op|po&s;ition in this ca&s;e: the world has its eyes upon your conduct; do not give it rea&s;on to &s;ay that your daughter is more prudent and cautious than you are; nor force her to do that without your con&s;ent which you ought to be the fir&s;t to advi&s;e her to.</Q></P>
<P>"Without my con&s;ent!" re|plied Mrs. Darnley, almo&s;t breath|le&s;s
<PB N="118" REF="127">
with rage;
<Q>will &s;he go with|out my con&s;ent, &s;ay you; have you alienated her affections from me &s;o far? I will &s;oon know that.</Q></P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing with a furious air, &s;he called Sophia, who came into the room, trembling, and in the utmo&s;t agitation. The melancho|ly that appeared in her counte|nance, the palene&s;s and di&s;order, the con&s;equences of a &s;leeple&s;s night, which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in various and afflicting thoughts, made Mr. Herbert apprehen&s;ive that her mother's ob&s;tinacy would prove too hard for her gentle di&s;|po&s;ition; and that her heart, thus a&s;&s;aulted with the mo&s;t powerful of all pa&s;&s;ions, love and filial ten|derne&s;s, would in&s;en&s;ibly betray her into a con&s;ent to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley giving her a look of indignation, exclaimed with the
<PB N="119" REF="128">
&s;arca&s;tic &s;everity with which &s;he u&s;ed formerly to treat her;
<Q>So my wi&s;e, my dutiful daughter! you cannot bear, it &s;eems, to live with your mother; you are re&s;olved to run away from me, are you?</Q></P>
<P>"Madam," replied Sophia, with a firmne&s;s that di&s;concerted Mrs. Darnley, as much as it plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Herbert,
<Q>it is not you I am running away from, as you unkindly &s;ay, I am going into the country to free my&s;elf from the pur&s;uits of a man who has impo&s;ed upon your goodne&s;s, and my credulity; one who I am convinced, &s;eeks my di&s;ho|nour, and who&s;e en&s;naring ad|dre&s;&s;es have already, I am afraid, given a wound to my reputa|tion, which nothing but the re|&s;olution I have taken to avoid him can heal.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="129">Poor Sophia, who had with diffi|culty prevailed over her own &s;oft|ne&s;s to &s;peak in this determined manner, could not bear to &s;ee the confu&s;ion into which her an&s;wer had thrown her mother; but &s;igh|ing deeply, &s;he retired towards the window, and wiped away the tears that fell from her charming eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, who ob&s;erved her emotion, and well knew how to take advantage of that amiable weakne&s;s in her temper, which made any oppo&s;ition, however ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, painful to her, de|&s;ired Mr. Herbert to leave her alone with her daughter, adding that his pre&s;ence was a con&s;traint upon them both.</P>
<P>Sophia, hearing this, and dread|ing le&s;t he &s;hould leave her to &s;u&s;|tain the &s;torm alone, went towards her mother, and with the mo&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="130">
per&s;ua&s;ive look and accent, begged her not to part in anger from Mr. Herbert.</P>
<P>"I cannot forgive Mr. Herbert," &s;aid Mrs Darnley,
<Q>for &s;uppo&s;ing I am le&s;s concerned for your ho|nour than he is. I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;i|ty for your going into the coun|try; your reputation is &s;afe while you are under my care; it is time enough to &s;end you out of Sir Charles's way when we are convinced his de&s;igns are not honourable. Mr. Herbert, by filling your head with groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ions, will be the ruin of your fortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles's di&s;&s;embled affec|tion for me,</Q>
interrupted Sophia,
<Q>will be the ruin of my character. There is no way to convince the world that I am not the willing dupe of his artifices, but by fly|ing from him as far as I can: do
<PB N="122" REF="131">
not, my dear mamma,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, bur&s;ting into tears,
<Q>oppo&s;e my going; my peace of mind, my reputation depend upon it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;hall go when I think proper,</Q>
replied Mrs. Darnley; "and as for you, Sir," turning to Mr. Herbert,
<Q>I de&s;ire you will not interpo&s;e any farther in this matter.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed I mu&s;t, madam," &s;aid the good old man, encouraged by a look Sophia gave him;
<Q>I con&s;ider my&s;elf as guardian to your daughter, and in that quality I pretend to &s;ome right to regulate her conduct on an occa&s;ion which requires a guardian's care and authority.</Q></P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" exclaimed Mrs. Darnley, with a malignant &s;neer,
<Q>what a je&s;t! to call your&s;elf guardian to a girl who has not a &s;hilling to depend upon.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="132">
<Q>I am the guardian of her ho|nour and reputation,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Herbert:
<Q>the&s;e make up her for|tune: and with the&s;e &s;he is richer than if &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thou&s;ands without them.</Q></P>
<P>"And do you, Mi&s;s," &s;aid Mrs. Darnley to her daughter, with a &s;cornful air,
<Q>do you allow this fooli&s;h claim? Are you this gen|tleman's ward, pray?</Q></P>
<P>"Come, madam," &s;aid Mr. Her|bert, willing to &s;pare Sophia the pain of an&s;wering her que&s;tion,
<Q>be per&s;uaded that I have the ten|derne&s;s of a parent, as well as guardian, for your daughter: it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould &s;ee Sir Charles no more; and the mo&s;t effectual method &s;he can take to &s;hun him, and to pre&s;erve her character, is to leave a place where &s;he will be continually expo&s;ed to his importunity. I
<PB N="124" REF="133">
hope &s;he will be able to procure your con&s;ent to her going to|morrow. I &s;hall be here in the morning with a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and will conduct her my&s;elf to the hou&s;e of my friend, whom I have already prepared by a letter to receive her.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, without waiting for any an&s;wer, bowed and left the room. Sophia followed him to the door, and by a &s;peaking glance a&s;|&s;ured him he might depend upon her per&s;everance.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> In which Sophia &s;hews le&s;s of the He|roine than the Woman.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as Mr. Herbert went away, Harriot, who had been li&s;tening, and had heard all that pa&s;t, entered the room. The vir|tue and &s;trength of mind her &s;i&s;ter &s;hewed in the de&s;ign &s;he had form|ed of flying from Sir Charles Stan|ley excited her envy; and &s;he would have joined with her mother in en|deavouring to prevail upon her to &s;tay, to prevent the &s;uperiority &s;uch a conduct gave her, had not that envy found a more &s;en&s;ible gratifi|cation in the thought that Sophia would no longer receive the ado|rations of the young baronet; and that all her towering hopes would
<PB N="126" REF="135">
be changed to di&s;appointment and grief.</P>
<P>The di&s;continuance of tho&s;e pre|&s;ents which Sir Charles &s;o liberally be&s;towed on them, evidently on Sophia's account, and which had hitherto enabled them to live in af|fluence, affected her but little; for vanity is a more powerful pa&s;|&s;ion than intere&s;t in the heart of a coquet; and the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her &s;i&s;ter mortified and de&s;erted by her lover, outweighed all other con|&s;iderations: be&s;ides, &s;he was not without hopes that when Sophia was out of the way, her own charms would regain all their former in|fluence over the heart of Sir Charles.</P>
<P>She came prepared, therefore, to &s;upport her in her re&s;olution of go|ing into the country; but Mrs. Darnley, who did not enter into her views, and who had no other
<PB N="127" REF="136">
attention but to &s;ecure to her&s;elf that ea&s;e and affluence &s;he at pre|&s;ent enjoyed, expected Harriot would u&s;e her utmo&s;t efforts to pre|vent her &s;i&s;ter from di&s;obliging a man who&s;e liberality was the &s;ource of their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>She complained to her in a ten|der manner of Sophia's unkindne&s;s; &s;he exaggerated the ill con&s;equences that might be apprehended from the affront &s;he put on Sir Charles, by thus avowing the mo&s;t injurious &s;u&s;|picions of him; and declared &s;he expected nothing le&s;s than to be reduced by the lo&s;s of her pen|&s;ion to that &s;tate of mi&s;ery from which he had formerly relieved her.</P>
<P>Sophia melted into tears at the&s;e words; but a moment's reflection convinced her, that her mo|ther's apprehen&s;ions were altogether groundle&s;s: Sir Charles was not ca|pable
<PB N="128" REF="137">
of &s;o mean a revenge; and Sophia, on this occa&s;ion, defended him with &s;o much ardor, that Mi&s;s Darnley could not help indulging her malice, by throwing out &s;ome &s;evere &s;arca&s;ms upon the violence of her affection for a man whom &s;he affected to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>Sophia blu&s;hed; but an&s;wered calmly,
<Q>Well, &s;i&s;ter, if I love Sir Charles Stanley, I have the more merit in leaving him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, not a bit the more for that,</Q>
replied Harriot;
<Q>for, as I read in one of your books ju&s;t now, <HI>Virtue would not go &s;o far, if pride did not bear her com|pany.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>You might al&s;o have read, &s;i&s;|ter,</Q>
&s;aid Sophia,
<Q>that no woman is envious of another's virtue who is con&s;cious of her own.</Q></P>
<P>This retort threw Harriot into &s;o violent a rage, that Sophia, who
<PB N="129" REF="138">
knew what exce&s;&s;es &s;he was ca|pable of, left the room, and retired to pack up her cloaths, that &s;he might be ready when Mr. Herbert called for her.</P>
<P>In this employment Mrs. Darn|ley gave her no interruption; for Harriot having quitted her mother in a huff, becau&s;e &s;he did not join with her again&s;t Sophia, &s;he was left at liberty to pur&s;ue her own reflections. After long doubt and perplexity in what manner to act, &s;he re&s;olved to con&s;ent that Sophia &s;hould depart; for &s;he &s;aw plainly that it would not be in her power to prevent it, and &s;he was willing to derive &s;ome merit from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity &s;he was under of complying. She con&s;idered that if Sir Charles really loved her daughter, her flight on &s;uch motives would rather in|crea&s;e than le&s;&s;en his pa&s;&s;ion; and that all his re&s;entment for being de|prived
<PB N="130" REF="139">
of her &s;ight would fall upon Mr. Herbert, who alone was in fault.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, as has been be|fore ob&s;erved, was not of a temper to anticipate misfortunes, or to give her&s;elf much unea&s;ine&s;s about evils in futurity: &s;he always hoped the be&s;t, not becau&s;e &s;he had any well-grounded rea&s;ons for it, but becau&s;e it was much more plea&s;ing to hope than to fear.</P>
<P>Sophia, when &s;he &s;aw her next, found her &s;urpri&s;ingly altered: &s;he not only no longer oppo&s;ed her de|parture, but even &s;eemed de&s;irous of it; and this &s;he thought a ma&s;|ter-piece of cunning which could not fail of gaining Mr. Herbert's good opinion; never once reflect|ing that her former oppo&s;ition de|prived her of all the merit of a vo|luntary compliance.</P>
<P>This change in Mrs. Darnley left Sophia no more difficulties to
<PB N="131" REF="140">
encounter but what &s;he found in her own heart. Indu&s;trious to de|ceive her&s;elf, &s;he had imputed all the unea&s;y emotions there to the grief of leaving her mother contra|ry to her inclination: &s;he had now her free con&s;ent to go, yet &s;till tho&s;e perturbations remained. She thanked her mother for her indul|gence: &s;he took her hand, and tenderly pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips, tears at the &s;ame time flowing fa&s;t from her eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley was cruel enough to &s;hew that &s;he under&s;tood the cau&s;e of this &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion. "What," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>to the poor blu&s;hing Sophia, after all the clut|ter you have made about leaving Sir Charles, does your heart fail you now you come to the trial?</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, aba&s;hed and &s;ilent, hid her glowing face with her hand|kerchief;
<PB N="132" REF="141">
and having with &s;ome dif|ficulty repre&s;t another gu&s;h of tears, a&s;&s;umed compo&s;ure enough to tell her mother that &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould never want fortitude to do her duty.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure," replied Mrs. Darnley,
<Q>with a&s;neer, one &s;o wi&s;e as you can never mi&s;take your duty.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia however under&s;tood hers &s;o well that &s;he did not offer to re|criminate upon this occa&s;ion; for Mrs. Darnley was but a &s;hallow po|litician, and was thrown &s;o much off her guard by the vexation &s;he felt, that an affair on which &s;he built &s;uch great hopes had taken &s;o different a turn, that &s;he gave plain indications of her di&s;plea&s;ure, and that her con&s;ent to her daughter's going was indeed extorted from her.</P>
<P>Sophia had many of the&s;e a&s;&s;aults to &s;u&s;tain, as well from Harriot as
<PB N="133" REF="142">
Mrs. Darnley, during the re|mainder of that day; but they were of u&s;e to her. Her pride was concerned to prevent giving a real cau&s;e for &s;uch &s;arca&s;ms as her &s;i&s;ter in particular threw out: oppo&s;ition kept up her &s;pirits, and pre&s;erved her mind from yielding to that ten|der grief which the idea of parting for ever from Sir Charles excited.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> The De&s;cription of two Rural Beauties.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Herbert came the next morning, Mrs. Darnley, who had no better part to play, had recour&s;e again to di&s;&s;i|mulation, and expre&s;&s;ed great wil|lingne&s;s to &s;end her daughter away; but the good man, who &s;aw the feint in her overacted &s;atisfaction, &s;uffered her to imagine that &s;he had effectually impo&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>Sophia wept when &s;he took leave of her mother, and returned the cold &s;alute her &s;i&s;ter gave her with an affectionate embrace. She &s;igh|ed deeply as Mr. Herbert helped her into the po&s;t-chai&s;e; and con|tinued pen&s;ive and &s;ilent for &s;everal minutes, not daring to rai&s;e her
<PB N="135" REF="144">
eyes up to her kind conductor, le&s;t he &s;hould read in them what pa&s;&s;ed in her heart.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who gue&s;&s;ed what &s;he felt on this occa&s;ion, was &s;en&s;i|bly affected with that &s;oft melan|choly, &s;o ea&s;y to be di&s;covered in her countenance, notwith&s;tanding all her endeavours to conceal it. He wi&s;hed to comfort her, but the &s;ubject was too delicate to be men|tioned: kind and indulgent as he was, he began to think his admired Sophia carried her concern on this occa&s;ion too far; &s;o true that ob&s;er|vations is, that the ca&s;e of tried virtue is harder than that of untried: we require from it as debts continual exertions of its power, and if we are at any time di&s;appointed in our ex|pectations, we blame with re&s;ent|ment as if we had been deceived.</P>
<P>Sophia's &s;en&s;ibility, however, was very excu&s;able; in flying from Sir

Charles &s;he had done all that the mo&s;t rigid virtue could demand; for as yet &s;he had only &s;u&s;picions again&s;t him; and this man, who&s;e generous gift &s;he had returned with &s;ilent &s;corn, whom &s;he had avoid|ed as an enemy, had hitherto be|haved to her with all the tender|ne&s;s of a lover, and all the benevo|lence of a friend. It was under that amiable idea that he now pre|&s;ented him&s;elf to her imagination; her pride and her re&s;entment were appea&s;ed by the &s;acrifice &s;he had made in her abrupt departure, and every unkind thought of him was changed to tender regret for his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, by not attempting to divert the cour&s;e of her reflec|tions, &s;oon drew her out of her revery: his &s;ilence and re&s;erve fir&s;t intimated to her the impropriety of her behaviour. She immediately
<PB N="137" REF="146">
a&s;&s;umed her u&s;ual compo&s;ure, and during the remainder of their little journey, &s;he appeared as chearful and &s;erene as if nothing extraordi|nary had happened.</P>
<P>The good curate with whom &s;he was to lodge having rode out to meet his friend and his fair gue&s;t, joined them when they had come within three miles of his hou&s;e. Mr. Herbert, who had de&s;cried him at a little di&s;tance, &s;hewed him to Sophia: "There, my dear," &s;aid he,
<Q>is a man who, with more pie|ty and learning than would &s;erve to make ten bi&s;hops, is oblig|ed to hire him&s;elf out at the rate of &s;ixty pounds a year, to do the duty of the pari&s;h church, the rector of which enjoys three lu|crative benefices, without pray|ing or preaching above five times in a twelvemonth.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on, for that was the
<PB N="138" REF="147">
curate's name, had now galloped up to the chai&s;e, which Mr. Her|bert had ordered the po&s;t-boy to &s;top, and many kind &s;alutations pa&s;&s;ed between the two friends.</P>
<P>Sophia was particularly plea&s;ed with the candor and benevolonce which appeared in the looks and behaviour of the good clergyman; who gazed on her attentively, and found the good opinion he had en|tertained of her from Mr. Her|bert's repre&s;entations fully confirm|ed. The bewitching &s;weetne&s;s in her voice and eyes, the &s;pirit that animated her looks, and the pecu|liar elegance of her per&s;on and ad|dre&s;s, produced their u&s;ual effects, and filled Mr. Law&s;on's heart with &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s, e&s;teem, and re&s;pect for her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Law&s;on and her two daughters received her with that true politene&s;s which is founded on
<PB N="139" REF="148">
good &s;en&s;e and good nature. Both the young women were extremely agreeable in their per&s;ons, and So|phia contemplated with admiration the neat &s;implicity of their dre&s;s, their artle&s;s beauty, and native &s;weetne&s;s of manners. Health dyed their cheeks with blu&s;hes more beautiful than tho&s;e the fine lady borrows from paint; innocence and chearfulne&s;s lighted up &s;miles in their faces, as powerful as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed coquet; and good humour and a &s;incere de&s;ire of obliging, gave graces to their be|haviour which ceremony but poor|ly imitates.</P>
<P>The&s;e were Sophia's ob&s;ervations to Mr. Herbert, who &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;peaking to her apart, to a&s;k her opinion of her new companions. He was rejoiced to hear her expre&s;s great &s;atisfaction in her new &s;ituation, and not doubting
<PB N="140" REF="149">
but time and ab&s;ence, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her own good &s;en&s;e and virtue, would bani&s;h Sir Charles Stan|ley entirely from her remembrance; he &s;crupled not to leave her at the end of three days, after hav|ing tenderly recommended her to the care of this little worthy family, every individual of which already loved her with extreme af|fection.</P>
<P>Sophia was indeed &s;o much de|lighted with the new &s;cene of life &s;he had entered upon, and her fancy was at fir&s;t &s;o &s;truck with the novelty of all the objects &s;he beheld, that the continual di&s;&s;ipa|tion of her thoughts left no room for the idea of the baronet: but this deceitful calm la&s;ted not long. She &s;oon found by experi|ence, that the &s;ilence and &s;olitude of the country were more proper to nouri&s;h love than to de&s;troy it;
<PB N="141" REF="150">
and that groves and meads, the nightingale's &s;ong, and the rivulet's murmur, were food for tender me|lancholy, and the &s;oft reveries of imagination.</P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e was mo&s;t ro|manticly &s;ituated on the borders of a &s;pacious park; from who&s;e opulent owner he rented a &s;mall farm, which &s;upplied his fami|ly with almo&s;t all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Mrs. Law&s;on his wife, brought him a very &s;mall for|tune, but a great &s;tock of virtue, good &s;en&s;e, and prudence. She had &s;een enough of the world to poli&s;h her manners without cor|rupting her heart; and having lived mo&s;t part of her time in the country, &s;he under&s;tood rural af|fairs perfectly well, and &s;uperintend|ed all the bu&s;ine&s;s of their little farm. Their two daughters were at once the be&s;t hou&s;e-wifes, and
<PB N="142" REF="151">
the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young wo|men in that part of the country. Mr. Law&s;on took upon him&s;elf the delightful ta&s;k of improving their minds, and giving them a ta&s;te for u&s;eful knowledge: and their mother, be&s;ides in&s;tructing them in all the economical duties &s;uit|able to their humble fortunes, form|ed them to tho&s;e decencies of manners and propriety of beha|viour, which &s;he had acquired by a genteel education, and the con|ver&s;ation of per&s;ons of rank. In the affairs of the family, each of the young women had their par|ticular province a&s;&s;igned them. Dolly, the elde&s;t, pre&s;ided in the dairy; and Fanny, &s;o was the younge&s;t called, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ma|nagement of the hou&s;e. Sophia &s;oon entertained a friend&s;hip for them both; but a powerful incli|nation attached her particularly to
<PB N="143" REF="152">
Dolly. There was in the coun|tenance of this young woman a cer|tain &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility that plea&s;ed Sophia extremely; and though &s;he had all that chearful|ne&s;s which youth, health, and in|nocence in&s;pire, yet the pen&s;ivene&s;s that would &s;ometimes &s;teal over her &s;weet features, the gentle &s;ighs that would now and then e&s;cape her, excited a partial tender|ne&s;s for her in the heart of Sophia.</P>
<P>She took plea&s;ure in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her in her little employments. Dolly in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t that awe which the pre&s;ence of the fair Londoner fir&s;t in&s;pired, and repaid her tenderne&s;s with that warmth of affection which only young and innocent minds are capable of feeling.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Sophia makes an intere&s;ting Di&s;co|very.</HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA, in&s;tructed by her own experience, &s;oon di&s;covered that her young friend was in love; but neither of them di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret of their hearts to each other. Dolly was with-held by ba&s;hful timidity, Sophia by delicate re&s;erve. Fond as they were of each other's company, yet the want of this mutual confi|dence made them &s;ometime chu&s;e to be alone. Sophia having one evening &s;trayed in the wood, wholly ab&s;orbed in melancholy thoughts, lo&s;t her way, and was in &s;ome per|plexity how to recover the path that led to Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e; when looking anxiou&s;ly around her, &s;he &s;aw Dolly at a di&s;tance, &s;itting un|der
<PB N="145" REF="154">
a tree. Overjoyed to meet her &s;o luckily, &s;he was running up to her, but &s;topped upon the appear|ance of a young man, who, &s;eeing Dolly, flew towards her with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s, and with &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of joyful &s;urprize in his countenance, as per&s;uaded her this meeting was accidental.</P>
<P>Sophia, not willing to interrupt their conver&s;ation, pa&s;&s;ed on &s;oftly behind the trees, unob&s;erved by Dolly, who continued in the &s;ame pen&s;ive attitude; but being now nearer to her, &s;he perceived &s;he was weeping exce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>Sophia, who was greatly affected at this fight, could not help accom|panying her tears with &s;ome of her own; and not daring to &s;tir a &s;tep farther, for fear of being &s;een by the youth, &s;he re&s;olved to take advantage of her &s;ituation, to know
<PB N="146" REF="155">
the occa&s;ion of Dolly's extraordi|nary affliction.</P>
<P>The poor girl was &s;o wrapt in thought, that &s;he neither &s;aw nor heard the approach of her lover, who called to her in the tendere&s;t accent imaginable,
<Q>My dear Dolly, is it you? Won't you look at me? Won't you &s;peak to me? What have I done to make you angry, my love? Don't go,</Q>
(for upon hearing his voice &s;he &s;tarted from her &s;eat, and &s;eemed de&s;irous to avoid him)
<Q>don't go, my dear Dolly,</Q>
&s;aid he, following her, (and &s;he went &s;lowly enough)
<Q>don't drive me to de&s;pair.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What would you have me do, Mr. William,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he, &s;topping and turning gently towards him;
<Q>you know my father has forbid me to &s;peak to you, and I would die rather than di&s;oblige him:
<PB N="147" REF="156">
you may thank your proud rich aunt for all this. Pray let me go,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, making &s;ome faint efforts to withdraw her hand, which he had &s;eized and held fa&s;t in his,
<Q>you mu&s;t forget me, Wil|liam, as I have re&s;olved to forget you,</Q>
added &s;he &s;ighing, and turning away her head, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ee the tears that fell from her eyes.</P>
<P>Cruel as the&s;e words &s;ounded in the ears of the pa&s;&s;ionate William, yet he found &s;omething in her voice and actions that comforted him; "No, my dear Dolly," &s;aid he, endeavouring to look in her averted face,
<Q>I will not believe that you have re&s;olved to forget me; you can no more forget me, than I can you, and I &s;hall love you as long as I live&mdash;I know you &s;ay this only to grieve me; you do not mean it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="157">"Yes, I do mean it," replied Dolly, in a peevi&s;h accent, vexed that he had &s;een her tears.
<Q>I know my duty, and you &s;hall find that I can obey my father.</Q>
While &s;he &s;poke this, &s;he &s;truggled &s;o much in earne&s;t to free her hand from his, that fearing to offend her, he dropped it with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive air.</P>
<P>Dolly having now no pretence for &s;taying any longer, bid him farewell in a faltering voice, and went on, though with a &s;low pace, towards her father's hou&s;e. The youth con|tinued for a moment motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue, with a countenance pale as death, and his eyes, which were &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, fixed on the parting virgin.</P>
<P>"What," cried he at la&s;t, in the mo&s;t plaintive tone imaginable,
<Q>can you really leave me thus? go then, my dear unkind Dolly, I
<PB N="149" REF="158">
will trouble you no more with my hateful pre&s;ence; I wi&s;h you happy, but if you hear that any &s;trange mi&s;chief has befallen me, be a&s;&s;ured you are the cau&s;e of it.</Q></P>
<P>He followed her as he &s;poke, and Dolly no longer able to continue her a&s;&s;umed rigour, &s;topped when he approached her, and bur&s;t into tears. The lover felt all his hopes revive at this &s;ight, and taking her hand, which he ki&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and times, he uttered the tendere&s;t vows of love and con&s;tancy; to which &s;he li&s;tened in &s;ilence, only now and then &s;oftly &s;ighing; at length &s;he di&s;engaged her hand, and gently begged him to leave her, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;een by any of the family. The happy youth, once more con|vinced of her affection for him, obeyed without a murmur.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="159">Dolly, as &s;oon as he had quitted her, ran ha&s;tily towards home; but he, as if every &s;tep was leading him to his grave, moved &s;lowly on, of|ten looking back, and often &s;top|ping: &s;o that Sophia, who was afraid &s;he would not be able to overtake her friend, was obliged to hazard being &s;een by him, and fol|lowed Dolly with all the &s;peed &s;he could. As &s;oon as &s;he was near enough to be heard, &s;he called out to her to &s;tay. Dolly &s;topt, but was in &s;o much confu&s;ion at the thought of having been &s;een by Mi&s;s Darn|ley, with her lover, that &s;he had not courage to go and meet her. "Ah, Mi&s;s Dolly," &s;aid Sophia &s;miling,
<Q>I have made a di&s;covery; but I do a&s;&s;ure you it was as ac|cidental as your meeting with that hand&s;ome youth, who I find is your lover.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="160">"Yes, indeed," replied Dolly, who&s;e face was covered with blu&s;hes,
<Q>my meeting with that young man was not de&s;igned, at lea&s;t on my part: but &s;urely you je&s;t, Mi&s;s Darnley, when you call him hand&s;ome: do you really think him hand&s;ome?</Q></P>
<P>"Upon my word I do," &s;aid So|phia;
<Q>he is one of the prettie&s;t youths I ever &s;aw; and if the profe&s;&s;ions of men may be re|lied on,</Q>
added &s;he, with a &s;igh,
<Q>he certainly loves you; but, my dear Dolly, by what I could learn from your conver&s;ation, he has not your father's con&s;ent to make his addre&s;&s;es to you; I was &s;orry to hear that, Dolly, becau&s;e I perceive, my dear, that you like him.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly now held down her head, and blu&s;hed more than before, but continued &s;ilent.
<Q>Perhaps you
<PB N="152" REF="161">
will think me impertinent,</Q>
re|&s;umed Sophia,
<Q>for &s;peaking &s;o freely about your affairs; but I love you dearly, Mi&s;s Dolly.</Q>
&mdash; "And I," interrupted Dolly,
<Q>throwing one of her arms about Sophia's neck, and ki&s;&s;ing her cheek, love you, Mi&s;s Darnley, better a thou&s;and times than ever I loved any body, except my father and mother and my &s;i&s;|ter.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, well," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>I won't di&s;pute that point with you now; but if you love me &s;o much as you &s;ay, my dear Dolly, why have you made a &s;ecret of this affair? friends do not u&s;e to be &s;o re&s;erved with each other.</Q></P>
<P>"Perhaps," &s;aid Dolly, &s;miling a little archly,
<Q>you have taught me to be re&s;erved by your ex|ample; but indeed,</Q>
added &s;he,
<Q>with a graver look and accent,
<PB N="153" REF="162">
I am not worthy to be your confidant; you are my &s;uperior in every thing: It would be pre|&s;umption in me to de&s;ire to know your &s;ecrets.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;hall know every thing that concerns me,</Q>
interrupted Sophia,
<Q>which can be of u&s;e to you, and add weight to that ad|vice I &s;hall take the liberty to give you upon this occa&s;ion: I am far from being happy, my dear Dol|ly, and I blu&s;h to &s;ay it; it has been in the power of a deceitful man greatly to di&s;turb my peace.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia here wiped her charming eyes, and Dolly who wept &s;ympa|thetically for her, and for her&s;elf, exclaimed,
<Q>Is there a man in the world who could be fal&s;e to you? alas! what have I to expect?</Q></P>
<P>"Come, my dear," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>leading her to the root of a large tree, let us &s;it down here, we

&s;hall not be called to &s;upper yet, you have time enough to give me &s;ome account of this young man, whom I &s;hould be glad to find worthy of you: tell me how your acquaintance began, and what are your father's rea&s;ons for forbidding your corre&s;pon|dence.</Q></P>

<P>DOLLY, though encouraged by the &s;weet conde&s;cen&s;ion of So|phia, who, to in&s;pire her with con|fidence, freely acknowledged the &s;ituation of her own heart, blu&s;hed &s;o much, and was in &s;uch apparent confu&s;ion, that Sophia was con|cerned at having made her a reque&s;t which gave her &s;o much pain to comply with.</P>
<P>At length the innocent girl, looking up to her with a ba&s;hful air, &s;aid,
<Q>I &s;hould be a&s;hamed, dear mi&s;s, to own my weakne&s;s to you, if I did not know that you are too generous to think the wor&s;e of me for it: to be &s;ure I have a great value for Mr.
<PB N="156" REF="165">
William; but I was not &s;o fooli&s;h as to be taken with his hand|&s;omene&s;s only, tho' indeed he is very hand&s;ome, and I am de|lighted to find that you think him &s;o; but Mr. William, as my father can tell you, madam, is a very fine &s;cholar: he was edu|cated in a great &s;chool at London, and there is not a young &s;quire in all this country who has half his learning, or knows how to behave him&s;elf &s;o genteely as he does, though his father is but a farmer: however, he is rich, and he has but one child be&s;ides Mr. William, and that is a &s;ickly boy, and not likely to live; &s;o that Mr. William, it is thought, will have all.</Q></P>
<P>"I &s;hould imagine then," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>that this young man would not be a bad match for you?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="166">"A bad match!" replied Dolly, &s;ighing:
<Q>no certainly; but his aunt looks higher for him: yet there was a time when &s;he was well enough plea&s;ed with his liking me.</Q></P>
<P>"What is his aunt," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>and how does it happen that &s;he has any authority over him?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why you mu&s;t know, ma|dam,</Q>
an&s;wered Dolly,
<Q>that his aunt is very rich; when &s;he was a young woman, a great lady took a fancy to her, and kept her as her companion a great many years, and when &s;he died, &s;he left her all her cloaths and jewels, and a prodigious deal of money: &s;he never would marry, for &s;he was cro&s;&s;ed in love they &s;ay in her youth, and that makes her &s;o ill-natured and &s;piteful, I believe, to young people; but notwith|&s;tanding that, I cannot help lov|ing
<PB N="158" REF="167">
her, becau&s;e &s;he was always &s;o fond of Mr. William: &s;he is his god-mother, and when he was about ten years old &s;he &s;ent for him to London, and declared &s;he would provide for him as her own; and indeed &s;he acted like a mother towards him: &s;he put him to &s;chool, and maintained him like a gentleman; and when he grew up, &s;he would have made a gentleman of him; for &s;he had a great de&s;ire that he &s;hould be an officer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. William at that time was very fond of being an officer too; but as he was very dutiful and obedient to his father, (indeed Mi&s;s Sophia he is one of the be&s;t young men in the world,) he de&s;ired leave to con&s;ult him fir&s;t; &s;o about a year ago he came to vi&s;it his father, and has never been at London &s;ince; and
<PB N="159" REF="168">
he had not been long in the country before he changed his mind as to being an officer, and declared he would be a farmer like his father, and live a country life.</Q></P>
<P>"Ah Dolly," &s;aid Sophia &s;mil|ing,
<Q>I &s;u&s;pect you were the cau&s;e of this change, my friend.</Q></P>
<P>"Why indeed," replied Dolly,
<Q>he has &s;ince told me &s;o: but perhaps he flattered me when he &s;aid it; for, ah my dear Mi&s;s, I remember what you &s;aid ju&s;t now about the deceitfulne&s;s of men, and I tremble le&s;t Mr. William &s;hould be like the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>"Well, my dear," interrupted Sophia,
<Q>go on with your &s;tory; I am impatient to know when you &s;aw each other fir&s;t, and how your acquaintance began.</Q></P>
<P>"You know, madam," &s;aid Dol|ly,
<Q>my father keeps us very re|tired:
<PB N="160" REF="169">
I had no opportunity of &s;eeing Mr. William but at church; we had heard that far|mer Gibbons had a fine &s;on come from London, and the Sunday af|terwards when we were at church, my &s;i&s;ter, who is a giddy wild girl, as you know, kept &s;taring about, in hopes of &s;eeing him. At la&s;t &s;he pulled me ha&s;ti|ly, and whi&s;pered, look, look, Dolly, there is farmer Gibbons ju&s;t come in, and I am &s;ure he has got his London &s;on with him, &s;ee what a hand&s;ome young man he is, and how genteely he is dre&s;t!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, madam, I looked up, and to be &s;ure I met Mr. Wil|liam's eyes full upon me; I felt my face glow like fire; for as &s;oon as I looked upon him, he made me a low bow. My &s;i&s;ter courtefied; but for my part, I
<PB N="161" REF="170">
don't know whether I courte&s;ied or not: I was never &s;o confu&s;ed in my life, and during the whole time we were at church, I &s;carce ever dur&s;t rai&s;e my eyes; for I was &s;ure to find Mr. William looking into our pew.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you was not di&s;plea&s;|ed with him,</Q>
&s;aid Sophia,
<Q>for taking &s;o much notice of you?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I do not know whether I was or not,</Q>
replied Dolly;
<Q>but I know that I was in a &s;trange con|fu&s;ion during all church-time; yet I ob&s;erved that Mr. William did not go out when the re&s;t of the congregation did, but &s;taid behind, which made my &s;i&s;ter laugh, for he looked fooli&s;h enough &s;tanding alone. But he &s;taid to have an opportunity of making us another bow; for it is my father's cu&s;tom, as &s;oon as he has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the people, to
<PB N="162" REF="171">
come into our pew and take us home with him. I never &s;hall forget how re&s;pectfully Mr. William &s;aluted my father as he pa&s;&s;ed him. I now made amends for my former neglect of him, and returned the bow he made me with a very low courte&s;y.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Fanny and I talked of him all the way home: I took delight in hearing her prai&s;e him; and al|though I was never u&s;ed to di&s;|gui&s;e my thoughts before, yet I knew not how it was, but I was a&s;hamed to &s;peak &s;o freely of him as &s;he did, and yet I am &s;ure I thought as well of him.</Q></P>

appearances: men's actions as well as their looks often deceive us; and you mu&s;t allow, my dear Dolly, that there is danger in the&s;e &s;udden attachments; but when did you &s;ee this pretty youth again?</Q></P>
<P>"Not till the next Sunday," replied Dolly;
<Q>and though you &s;hould chide me never &s;o much, yet I mu&s;t tell you that this &s;eemed the longe&s;t week I ever knew in my life. I did not doubt but he would be at church again, and I longed impatiently for Sunday. At la&s;t Sunday came; we went with my father as u&s;ual to church, and would you be|lieve it, Mi&s;s Darnley, though I wi&s;hed &s;o much to &s;ee Mr. Wil|liam, yet now I dreaded meeting him, and trembled &s;o when I came into church, that I was obliged to take hold of Fanny
<PB N="166" REF="175">
to keep me from falling. She &s;oon di&s;covered him, and pulled me in order to make me look up: he had placed him&s;elf in our way, &s;o that we pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by him. He made us a very low bow, and my mother, who had not &s;een him before, &s;miled and looked extremely plea&s;ed with him; for to be &s;ure, Madam, &s;he could not help admiring him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, I was very unea&s;y all the time we were in church; for Fanny whi&s;pered me that my &s;weet-heart,</Q>
for &s;o &s;he called Mr. William,
<Q>minded nothing but me. This made me blu&s;h exce&s;|&s;ively, and I was afraid my mo|ther would take notice of his &s;taring and my confu&s;ion; &s;o that (heaven forgive me) I was glad when the &s;ermon was ended. He made us his u&s;ual compliment at our going out, but I did not
<PB N="167" REF="176">
look up: however, I was impati|ent to be alone with Fanny, that I might talk of him, and in the evening we walked towards the Park. Ju&s;t as we had placed our&s;elves under a tree, we &s;aw a fine dre&s;t gentleman, a vi&s;iter of the Squire's as we &s;uppo&s;ed, coming up to us: upon which we ro&s;e and walked homewards; but the gentleman followed us, and coming clo&s;e to me, &s;tared impudently under my hat, and &s;wearing a great oath, &s;aid I was a pretty girl, and he would have a ki&s;s. Fanny &s;eeing him take me by the arm, &s;creamed aloud; but I, pretending not to be frightened, though I trembled &s;adly, civilly begged him to let me go. He did not regard what I &s;aid, but was extremely rude: &s;o that I now began to &s;cream as loud as Fanny, &s;truggling all the
<PB N="168" REF="177">
time to get from him, but in vain, and now who &s;hould come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance but Mr. Willi|am: I &s;aw him flying acro&s;s a field, and my heart told me it was he, before he came near enough for me to know him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as Fanny perceived him, &s;he ran to him, and begged him to help me; but he did not need intreaty; he flew like a bird to the place where I was, and left Fanny far behind. The rude gentleman bad him be gone, and threatened him &s;everely; for he had taken the hand I had at liberty, which I gladly gave him, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his letting me go: and now, my dear Mi&s;s Darnley, all my fears were for him, for the gentleman declared that if he did not go about his bu&s;ine&s;s, he would run him through the body, and actually
<PB N="169" REF="178">
drew his &s;word; I thought I &s;hould have died at that terrible &s;ight; my &s;i&s;ter run towards home crying like one di&s;tracted; and as for me, though the man had let go my hand, and I might have run away, yet I could not bear to leave Mr. William to the mercy of that cruel wretch; and I did what at another time I &s;hould have blu&s;hed to have done. I took his hand and pulled him with all my force away; but he, en|raged at being called puppy by the gentleman, who continued &s;wearing, that he would do him a mi&s;chief, if he did not leave the place, begged me to make the be&s;t of my way home; and turning furiou&s;ly to him who was brandi&s;hing his &s;word about, he knocked him down with one &s;troke of a cudgel which he fortunately had in his hand,
<PB N="170" REF="179">
and &s;natching his &s;word from him, he threw it among the bu&s;hes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon my word (&s;aid Sophia) your William's character ri&s;es upon me every moment: this was a very gallant action, and I do not wonder at your liking him now.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, Mi&s;s (cried Dolly) if you had &s;een how he looked when he came back to me, if you had heard the fine things he &s;aid&mdash;Well, you may imagine I thanked him for the kindne&s;s he had done me, and he prote&s;t|ed he would with plea&s;ure lo&s;e his life for my &s;ake. I think I could have li&s;tened to him for ever; but now my father ap|peared in &s;ight. My &s;i&s;ter had alarmed him greatly with her ac|count of what had happened, and he was coming ha&s;tily to my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="171" REF="180">
followed by my mother and all the family. As &s;oon as we perceived them coming we mended our pace; for we had walked very &s;lowly hitherto: then it was that Mr. William, who had not &s;poke &s;o plainly be|fore, told me how much he loved me, and begged I would give him leave to &s;ee me &s;ometimes. I replied, that depended upon my father, and this was prudent, was it not, my dear Mi&s;s Darn|ley?</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed it was," an&s;wered So|phia, "but what &s;aid your lover?"</P>
<P>"He &s;ighed, Madam," re&s;umed Dolly,
<Q>and &s;aid he was afraid my father would not think him worthy of me: he owned he was no otherwi&s;e worthy of me than from the great affection he bore me, and then&mdash;But here I

<P>"I hope not," &s;aid Sophia.</P>
<P>"Why, Madam," continued Dolly,
<Q>he took my hand and ki&s;&s;ed it a thou&s;and times; and tho' I did all I could to be &s;ure to pull it away, yet he would not part with it, till my father was &s;o near that he was afraid he would ob&s;erve him; and then he let it go, and begged me in a whi&s;per not to hate him. Ble&s;s me, what a &s;trange reque&s;t that was, Mi&s;s Darnley! how could I hate one to whom I had been &s;o greatly obliged! I was ready to bur&s;t into tears at the very thought, and told him I was &s;o far from hating him, that&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray go on, my dear (&s;aid So|phia) ob&s;erving &s;he he&s;itated and was &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="182">"I told him, Madam," re&s;umed &s;he,
<Q>that I would always regard him as long as I lived.&mdash;I did not &s;ay too much, did I?</Q></P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>you gave him to under&s;tand that it was in gratitude for the &s;ervice he had done you.</Q></P>
<P>"To be &s;ure," &s;aid Dolly,
<Q>I put it in that light. Well I am glad you approve of my behavi|our, Mi&s;s Darnley; &s;o, as I was telling you, my father came up to us, and thanked Mr. William for having re&s;cued his daughter; he then a&s;ked him what he had done with the rude fellow? Mr. William told him he had given him a lucky &s;troke with his cud|gel, which made him mea&s;ure his length on the ground; but,</Q>
<Q>&s;aid he (and &s;ure that &s;hewed exce&s;&s;ive good nature) I hope I have not hurt him much:</Q></P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="183">
<Q>My father &s;aid he would go and &s;ee; and then &s;haking Mr. William kindly by the hand, he called him a brave youth, and &s;aid he hoped they &s;hould be better acquainted&mdash;Oh! how glad was I to hear him &s;ay &s;o: My mother too was va&s;tly civil to him; and as for Fanny, I thought &s;he would have hugged him, &s;he was &s;o plea&s;ed with him for his kindne&s;s to me. My mother in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;taying to drink tea with us, and as &s;oon as my father came back, we all went in toge|ther.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray what became of the poor vanqui&s;hed knight?</Q>
&s;aid Sophia, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"Oh, I forgot to tell you," re|&s;umed Dolly,
<Q>that my father &s;aid he &s;aw him creeping along as if he was &s;orely brui&s;ed with
<PB N="175" REF="184">
his fall, &s;upporting him&s;elf with his &s;word, which it &s;eems he had found. We were all glad it was no wor&s;e, and Mr. William having accepted my mother's in|vitation, he &s;taid with us till the evening was pretty far ad|vanced; and then my father ac|companied him part of his way home, and at parting, as he told us, de&s;ired to &s;ee him often.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He was not backward, you may be &s;ure, in complying with his reque&s;t: he came &s;o often, that my father was &s;urpri&s;ed; and be&s;ides, my &s;i&s;ter and I &s;carce ever went out to walk but we met him; &s;o that one would have imagined he lived in the fields about our hou&s;e. My mother at la&s;t &s;u&s;pected the truth, and que&s;tioned me about him, and I told her all that he had ever &s;aid to me; and not long after|wards
<PB N="176" REF="185">
he took an opportunity to open his heart to my father, and a&s;ked his permi&s;&s;ion to make his addre&s;&s;es to me. With &s;uch mode&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e he &s;poke, that my father was extremely plea&s;ed with him: but told him that he mu&s;t con&s;ult his friends, and know whether they approved of it, and then he would con&s;i|der of his propo&s;al. Mr. William, as he afterwards told me, wrote to his aunt fir&s;t; for he was well a&s;&s;ured that his father would agree to any thing which &s;he thought for his advantage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He had a very favourable an|&s;wer from Mrs. Gibbons, for &s;he had changed her mind al&s;o, with regard to his being an officer, as war was then talked of; and &s;he was afraid of his being &s;ent abroad. He &s;hewed me her let|ter, and &s;he told him in it, that
<PB N="177" REF="186">
&s;ince he was re&s;olved to &s;ettle in the country, &s;he approved of his marrying; and was glad he had not fixed his affections upon &s;ome home&s;pun farmer's daughter, but had cho&s;en a gen|tlewoman, and one who was well brought up. She added, that &s;he intended to come into the country, in a few weeks; and if &s;he found the young lady (&s;o &s;he called me) an&s;wered his de&s;cription, &s;he would ha&s;ten the marriage, and &s;ettle us hand|&s;omely.&mdash;Oh! how plea&s;ed was I with this letter, and how did it rejoice Mr. William!</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hould never have done, were I to tell you all the tender things he &s;aid to me. Mr. Gibbons, at his &s;on's de&s;ire, came to my father, and begged him to give his con&s;ent, which he obtained; for my father had well con&s;idered
<PB N="178" REF="187">
the affair before: and nothing was wanting but Mrs. Gibbon's arrival to make us all happy. Mr. William thought every hour an age till &s;he came, and pre&s;t her continually in his letters to ha&s;ten her journey.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Alas! if he had known what was to happen, he would not have been &s;o impatient; for &s;oon after &s;he came, all our fine hopes were bla&s;ted; and I have now nothing to expect but mi&s;e|ry.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Sir Charles makes his appearance again.</HEAD>
<P>POOR Dolly was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, when &s;he came to this part of her &s;tory, that &s;he was unable to proceed, and bur&s;t into tears. The tender Sophia, who was greatly affected with the angui&s;h &s;he &s;aw her in, employed every &s;ooth|ing art to comfort her. And Dolly being a little compo&s;ed, was going to continue her &s;tory, when &s;he &s;aw her &s;i&s;ter looking about for them; Sophia and &s;he immediately ro&s;e up and joined Fanny, who rallied them both upon their fondne&s;s for lonely places; but perceiving that Dolly had been weeping, &s;he im|mediately became grave, and ac|commodated her looks and beha|viour
<PB N="180" REF="189">
to the gentle melancholy of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Sophia, from the &s;tate of her own mind, was but too much di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;ympathize with the love|&s;ick Dolly: the&s;e &s;oftening conver|&s;ations were ill calculated to bani&s;h from her remembrance the fir&s;t ob|ject of her innocent affections; and who, with all his faults, &s;he &s;till loved. Dolly's &s;tory awakened a thou&s;and tender ideas, and recalled to her memory every part of Sir Charles's conduct which had any re&s;emblance to that of the faithful and pa&s;&s;ionate William.</P>
<P>She dwelt with tender regret up|on the&s;e plea&s;ing images, and for a while forgot how nece&s;&s;ary it was for her peace, to &s;uppre&s;s every thought of Sir Charles, that tended to le&s;&s;en her ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="190">But, good and pious as &s;he was, the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he could not wholly &s;ubdue, &s;he regulated by rea&s;on and virtue; for, as an eminent Divine &s;ays,
<Q>Although it is not in our power to make affliction no af|fliction; yet we may take off the edge of it, by a &s;teady view of tho&s;e divine joys prepared for us in another &s;tate.</Q></P>
<P>It was quite otherwi&s;e with Sir Sir Charles: for the guilty, if un|happy, are doubly &s;o; becau&s;e they are deprived of tho&s;e re&s;ources of comfort, which the virtuous are &s;ure to find in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of hav|ing acted well.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, upon finding his &s;et|tlement &s;ent back to him, in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hewed not only the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;olution to reject his offers, but al&s;o a &s;ettled con|tempt for the offerer, became a prey
<PB N="182" REF="191">
to the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions: rage, grief, affronted pride, love ill re|quited, and di&s;appointed hope, tor|mented him by turns; nor was jea|lou&s;y without a place in his heart; the cha&s;te, the innocent, the re|&s;erved Sophia, became &s;u&s;pected by the man, who in vain attempted to corrupt her; &s;o true it is, that li|bertini&s;m gives &s;uch a colour to the actions of others, as takes away all di&s;tinction between virtue and vice.</P>
<P>Love, he argued, is either re|warded with a reciprocal affection, or with an inward and &s;ecret con|tempt; therefore he imputed So|phia's rejection of his offers, not to her di&s;approbation of the intention of them, but to want of affection for his per&s;on; and from her youth, and the tender &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, he concluded, that &s;ince he had failed in making an impre&s;&s;ion on it, it was already be&s;towed upon
<PB N="183" REF="192">
another; one while he re&s;olved to think no more of her, and repay her indifference and di&s;dain with &s;i|lence and neglect; the next mo|ment, dreading le&s;t he had lo&s;t her for ever, he regretted his having alarmed her with too early a di&s;co|very of his intentions, and &s;ome|times his pa&s;&s;ion tran&s;ported him &s;o far, as to make him think &s;eriou&s;ly of offering her his hand: then &s;tart|ing at his own weakne&s;s, and ap|prehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences, he &s;ought to arm him&s;elf again&s;t that tenderne&s;s which &s;ugge&s;ted &s;o mad a de&s;ign, by reflecting on her indif|ference towards him, and account|ing for it in &s;uch a manner, as fix|ed the &s;harpe&s;t &s;tings of jealou&s;y in his mind.</P>
<P>Thus various and perplexed were his thoughts and de&s;igns; and he was incapable of re&s;olving upon any thing, except to &s;ee her; and &s;o
<PB N="184" REF="193">
was his impatience, that he would have &s;et out for London the mo|ment he received the fatal paper, but decency would not permit him to leave his uncle, who was in a dying condition, and wi&s;hed only to expire in his arms.</P>
<P>The poor man, however, linger|ed a week longer, during which Sir Charles pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the mo&s;t melancholy hours he had ever known; at length his uncle's death left him at liberty to return to Lon|don, which he did immediately, and alighted at Mrs. Darnley's hou&s;e. Upon hearing &s;he was at home, he did not &s;end in his name, but walked up &s;tairs with a beating heart; he found Mrs. Darnley and Harriot together, but not &s;eeing the per&s;on whom he only wi&s;hed to &s;ee, he ca&s;t a melancholy look round the room, and an&s;wering, in a confu&s;ed and dejected manner, the mother's
<PB N="185" REF="194">
exce&s;&s;ive politene&s;s, and the cold civility of the daughter, he threw him&s;elf into a chair with a deep &s;igh, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>So evident a di&s;compo&s;ure plea&s;ed Mrs. Darnley as much as it mor|tified Harriot. As for Sir Charles, pride and re&s;entment hindered him at fir&s;t from enquiring for Sophia; but his anxiety and impatience to hear of her, &s;oon prevailed over all other con&s;iderations; and though he a&s;ked for her with an affected care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, yet his eyes, and the tone of his voice betrayed him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley told him, that &s;he was gone into the country:
<Q>Very much again&s;t my inclination,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he:
<Q>but Mr. Herbert, who you know, Sir, has great power over her, more I think than I have, would have it &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles growing pale as death, replied, in great emotion,
<Q>What!
<PB N="186" REF="195">
gone into the country? Where is &s;he gone? to whom? why did &s;he go? Again&s;t your inclina|tion, did you &s;ay, Madam? what could po&s;&s;ibly induce her to this? You &s;urprize me exce&s;&s;ively.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot, who did not chu&s;e to be pre&s;ent at the explanation of this affair, now ro&s;e up, and went out of the room, &s;miling &s;arca&s;tically, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by Sir Charles, and bridling with all the triumph of con&s;cious beauty. He, who was in a bad humour, beheld her airs not only with indifference but con|tempt, which he &s;uffered to appear pretty plain in his countenance; for he thought it but ju&s;t to mortify her for her ill u&s;age of her &s;i&s;ter, with|out con&s;idering that he him&s;elf was far more guilty, in that re&s;pect, towards the amiable Sophia, and equally de&s;erved to be hated by her.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="196">When Harriot was gone, Mrs. Darnley in&s;tantly renewed the con|ver&s;ation concerning Sophia; and finding that the young baronet li&s;t|ened to her, with eager attention, &s;he gave him a full account of all that had happened during his ab|&s;ence: &s;he repre&s;ented Sophia as hav|ing followed implicitly the direc|tions of Mr. Herbert, whom &s;he called a bu&s;y, meddling, officious, old man; and as the behaviour of her daughter, at her going away, gave &s;ufficient room to believe, that her heart &s;uffered greatly by the ef|fort &s;he made, &s;he dwelt upon every circum&s;tance that tended to &s;hew the concern &s;he was under; and did not &s;cruple to exaggerate, where &s;he thought it would be plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, though he inwardly rejoiced at what he heard, yet di&s;|&s;embled &s;o well, that no &s;igns of it appeared in his countenance. He
<PB N="188" REF="197">
now &s;eemed to li&s;ten with much indifference, and coldly &s;aid, he was &s;orry Mi&s;s Sophia would not permit him to make her ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The tranquillity he affected, a|larmed Mrs. Darnley: &s;he who was ever ready to judge by appearances, concluded that all was over, and that the baronet was irrecoverably lo&s;t; but had her judgment been more acute, &s;he would have per|ceived, that he was &s;till deeply in|tere&s;ted in every thing that related to Sophia. The que&s;tions he a&s;k|ed were not &s;uch as curio&s;ity &s;ug|ge&s;ts, but the tender anxiety of doubting love. Mrs. Darnley in|formed him of all he wi&s;hed to hear; Sophia had indeed fled from him, but not without reluctance and grief: &s;he was at pre&s;ent re|moved from his &s;ight, but &s;he was removed to &s;ilence and &s;olitude; and &s;he carried with her a fond im|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="189" REF="198">
which &s;olitude would not fail to increa&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus &s;atisfied, he put an end to his vi&s;it, with all imaginable com|po&s;ure, leaving Mrs. Darnley in doubt, whether &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him again, and more enraged than ever with Mr. Herbert, who&s;e fatal coun|&s;els had overthrown all her hopes.</P>

<P>IT was not long before Sophia had an account of Sir Charles's vi&s;it from her mother, who, for|getting the part &s;he had acted be|fore, wrote her a letter full of in|vectives again&s;t her ob&s;tinacy and di&s;obedience, and bitter upbraid|ings of her folly, for lo&s;ing by her ill-timed pride the heart of &s;uch a man as Sir Charles.</P>
<P>She told her, with a kind of ex|ultation, that he had entirely for|gotten her, and repeated every cir|cum&s;tance of his behaviour while he was with her, and every word he had &s;poke, as all tending to &s;hew his indifference; but though this was done to mortify Sophia, and make her repent of her precipitate

<P>Mrs. Darnley added, as the fi|ni&s;hing &s;troke, that Sir Charles looked pale and thin; &s;he attribut|ed this alteration in his health to efforts he had made to bani&s;h her from his heart, and thence inferred that a re&s;olution which had co&s;t him &s;o much trouble to confirm, would not be ea&s;ily broke through; and that &s;he had no rea&s;on to ex|pect he would ever de&s;ire to &s;ee her more.</P>
<P>Sophia could not read this part of the letter without tears, tears that flowed from tender &s;en&s;ibility, accompanied with a &s;en&s;ation which was neither grief nor joy, but com|po&s;ed

of both: that Sir Charles &s;hould re&s;olve to forget her was in|deed afflicting, but that this re&s;o|lution &s;hould co&s;t him &s;truggles &s;o painful as to affect his health, could not but rai&s;e her depre&s;&s;ed hopes, &s;ince it &s;hewed the difficulty of the attempt, and con&s;equently that the &s;ucce&s;s was doubtful.</P>
<P>This letter gave &s;o much employ|ment to her thoughts, that to be at liberty to indulge them &s;he took her evening walk without &s;ollicit|ing the company of her beloved Dolly, and wandered far into the wood, attracted by tho&s;e romantic &s;hades which afford &s;uch &s;oothing plea&s;ure to a love-&s;ick mind. Here, while &s;he meditated on her mother's letter, and read it over and over, &s;till &s;eeking, and &s;till finding &s;ome|thing new in it to engage her at|tention, &s;he heard the voices of &s;ome per&s;ons talking behind her,
<PB N="193" REF="202">
and &s;uddenly recollecting Dolly's adventure, &s;he began to be alarmed at the di&s;tance to which &s;he had unwarily &s;trayed, and turned her &s;teps ha&s;tily towards home.</P>
<P>Mean time a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind blew off her hat, and carried it &s;e|veral paces back: &s;he turned, in order to recover it, and &s;aw it taken up by a genteel young man, who on a nearer approach &s;he knew to be the lover of her young friend.

<P>While &s;he was talking to him they were joined by an ancient gen|tlewoman, who acco&s;ting Sophia, told her in an affected &s;tyle and for|mal accent, that her nephew was very happy in having had an oppor|tunity to do her this little piece of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Sophia, who &s;aw an old woman, apparently oppre&s;t with the infirmi|ties of years, dre&s;t in all the ridi|culous foppery of the la&s;t age, was &s;o little plea&s;ed with her, that &s;he would have an&s;wered this compli|ment with great coldne&s;s, had not the de&s;ire and hope of being &s;er|viceable to her friend made her conquer her growing di&s;gu&s;t; &s;he therefore re&s;olved to improve this
<PB N="195" REF="204">
opportunity of commencing an ac|quaintance with the aunt of young William, and met her advances with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s and affa|bility, &s;o that the old woman was quite charmed with her; and be|ing very de&s;irous to gain her good opinion, and to &s;hew her breeding, of which &s;he was extremely vain, overwhelmed her with trouble&s;ome ceremony; and, to di&s;play her un|der&s;tanding, of which &s;he was e|qually proud, murdered &s;o many hard words, that her di&s;cour&s;e was &s;carcely intelligible.</P>
<P>Sophia would fain have drawn in the youth to partake of their con|ver&s;ation, but his aunt's volubility left him very little to &s;ay; yet in that little Sophia thought &s;he di&s;|covered both good &s;en&s;e and polite|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The evening being now pretty far advanced, Sophia thought it time
<PB N="196" REF="205">
to &s;eparate, and took leave of her new acquaintance. Their parting was protracted by &s;o many courte|&s;ies and compliments from the old lady, that her patience was almo&s;t wearied out; at la&s;t &s;he got free from her, and quickened her pace towards home, when on a &s;udden &s;he heard her in a tremulous voice calling out,
<Q>Madam, madam, pray &s;top one moment.</Q>
Sophia look|ed back, and &s;eeing Mrs. Gibbons come tottering up to her with more &s;peed than was con&s;i&s;tent with her weakne&s;s, &s;he met her half way, and &s;miling, a&s;ked her why &s;he had turned back.</P>
<P>"Oh, madam," replied &s;he, I
<Q>am ready to &s;ink with confu&s;ion! what a <HI>&s;ol&s;im</HI> in good breeding have I committed! to be &s;ure you will think I have been u&s;ed to conver&s;e with &s;avages only.</Q>
So|phia,
<PB N="197" REF="206">
not able to gue&s;s what this &s;peech tended to, looked at Mr. Gibbons as if &s;he wi&s;hed for an explanation.</P>
<P>"My aunt, madam," &s;aid the youth, (blu&s;hing a little at the old woman's affectation,)
<Q>is concern|ed that you &s;hould walk home alone, and that I cannot offer my &s;ervice to attend you, being obliged to lead her, as you &s;ee.</Q></P>
<P>"That is not all, nephew," &s;aid the ceremonious gentlewoman:
<Q>you do not tell the young lady the true cau&s;e of the <HI>dilemnia</HI> I am in: I would not leave you, madam,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he,
<Q>till I &s;aw you &s;afe home, but you live with a family who has affronted me, and I cannot endure to come within &s;ight of the hou&s;e. I ne|ver can forgive an affront, that would be to &s;hew I do not un|der&s;tand the laws of good breed|ing:
<PB N="198" REF="207">
but I thank heaven no body can charge me with that, I was very early <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> into polite life; but &s;ome people are not to be <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> with.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope," &s;aid Sophia, (&s;carce able to compo&s;e her countenance to any tolerable degree of &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s)
<Q>that none of Mr. Law&s;on's family have given you cau&s;e of complaint: they &s;eem to me in|capable of affronting any one, much more a per&s;on that</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh, dear madam," interrupted the old lady, courte&s;ying low,
<Q>you do me a great deal of honour; but you will find, nay you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved already, that Mrs. Law&s;on is vulgar, very vulgar, &s;he knows nothing of decorums.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am very &s;orry for this mi&s;|under&s;tanding between you,</Q>
&s;aid Sophia,
<Q>and I &s;hould think it a very great happine&s;s if I could
<PB N="199" REF="208">
be any way u&s;eful in renewing your friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh," cried Mrs. Gibbons,
<Q>you might as well think of join|ing the <HI>Antipoles,</HI> madam, as of bringing us together again; and I am grieved beyond mea&s;ure when I think that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to wait on you.</Q></P>
<P>"However," an&s;wered Sophia,
<Q>you will have no objection, I hope, to my coming to &s;ee you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! I mu&s;t not admit of that by any means, madam,</Q>
replied Mrs. Gibbons,
<Q>you came la&s;t into the country, and you are entitled to the fir&s;t vi&s;it; I would not for the world break through the laws of politene&s;s; I am &s;orry you have &s;o indifferent an opinion of my breeding.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia perceiving that the old gentlewoman was a little di&s;com|po&s;ed,
<PB N="200" REF="209">
for this article of good breed|ing was a tender point with her, endeavoured to bring her into good humour, by &s;ome well-timed com|pliments, and once more took leave of her; but Mrs. Gibbons now in|&s;i&s;ted upon her nephew's &s;eeing her &s;afe home, &s;aying,
<Q>She would re&s;t her&s;elf under a tree till he came back.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia but faintly declined this civility, for &s;he feared to offend her again; and the joy that &s;park|led in William's eyes when his aunt made this offer of his attend|ance, made her unwilling to di&s;ap|point him of the hope of &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;o after much ceremony on the part of Mrs. Gibbons, they &s;eparated.</P>
<P>As they walked, Sophia took oc|ca&s;ion to expre&s;s her concern for the violent re&s;entment his aunt had
<PB N="201" REF="210">
entertained again&s;t Mr. Law&s;on's family, and which &s;eemed to make a reconciliation hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>The youth told her, that nothing could be more trivial than the ac|cident that had occa&s;ioned it; "and yet," pur&s;ued he, &s;ighing deeply,
<Q>&s;light as it is, the con|&s;equences are likely to be fatal enough.</Q></P>
<P>During their conver&s;ation Sophia di&s;covered &s;o much good &s;en&s;e and delicacy of &s;entiment in the young William, that &s;he more than ever pitied the fate of the&s;e poor lovers, who&s;e happine&s;s was &s;acrificed to the capricious temper of an affect|ed old woman: &s;he a&s;&s;ured him &s;he would neglect no opportunity to improve her acquaintance with his aunt: "And perhaps," &s;aid &s;he, with an inchanting &s;mile, that expre&s;&s;ed the benevolence of her heart,
<Q>I may be &s;o fortunate as
<PB N="202" REF="211">
to effect a reconciliation between her and my Dolly's family.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Gibbons thanked her in tran&s;ports of joy and gratitude; and now Dolly and her &s;i&s;ter, who had walked out in &s;earch of Sophia, ap|pearing in &s;ight, &s;he mended her pace, in order to come up with them &s;oon; for in the ardent glances that William &s;ent towards his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he read his impatience to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P>Dolly, who was in the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, to &s;ee Sophia thus accom|panied, took no notice of William; but avoiding, with a &s;weet ba&s;hful|ne&s;s, his earne&s;t and pa&s;&s;ionate looks, &s;he fixed her eyes on Mi&s;s Darnley, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to hear from her by what chance they had met.</P>
<P>"I know," &s;aid Sophia to her &s;miling,
<Q>that you did not expect to &s;ee me &s;o agreeably engaged; but Mr. Gibbons can inform you
<PB N="203" REF="212">
how his aunt, whom we left in the fore&s;t yonder, and I became acquainted.</Q>
She then addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e to Fanny, to give the lovers an opportunity of talking to each other.</P>
<P>Dolly a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning their meeting, and his aunt's behaviour to Mi&s;s Darnley; but the pa&s;&s;ionate youth leaving it to Sophia to &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, employed the few moments he had to &s;tay with her in tender a&s;&s;ur|ances of his own unaltered affec|tion, and complaints of her in|difference.</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid Dolly, with tears in her eyes,
<Q>I ought not to be blamed for obeying my father.</Q></P>
<P>"Ah, my dear Dolly," replied William,
<Q>our affections are not in the power of our fathers;
<PB N="204" REF="213">
and if you hate me now be|cau&s;e your father commands you to do &s;o, you never loved me.</Q></P>
<P>"Hate you," cried Dolly;
<Q>no, Mr. William, my father never bid me hate you; and if he had I am &s;ure I could not have obey|ed him: he only commanded me to forget you.</Q></P>
<P>"Only to forget me!" repeated William in a melancholy tone:
<Q>then you think that little, Dol|ly; and perhaps you will be able to obey him; but be a&s;&s;ured I would rather be hated by you than forgotten.</Q></P>
<P>"That is &s;trange, indeed," &s;aid Dolly, &s;miling through her tears.</P>
<P><Q>You would not think it &s;trange,</Q>
replied the youth, in an accent that expre&s;&s;ed at once
<PB N="205" REF="214">
grief and re&s;entment,
<Q>if you had ever loved. Ah Dolly! are all your tender promi&s;es come to this! little did I imagine I &s;hould ever &s;ee you altered thus! but I will trouble you no more,</Q>
added he, &s;ighing, as if his heart would break;
<Q>I will endeavour to follow your example: per|haps it is not &s;o difficult a thing as I imagined to cure one's &s;elf of love; you have &s;hewn me it is po&s;&s;ible, and if I fail in the attempt, I can be but mi&s;erable, and that you have made me now.</Q>
As he &s;poke the&s;e words, he turned half from her, and let fall &s;ome tears.</P>
<P>Dolly, who had no intention to make him unea&s;y, was exce&s;&s;ively affected with this &s;ight, and not a little alarmed at what he had &s;aid: "And will you," &s;aid &s;he, in the mo&s;t moving tone imaginable;
<Q><PB N="206" REF="215">will you try to forget me? then indeed you will be fal&s;e and perjured too, for you have &s;worn a thou&s;and times that you would love me for ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why &s;hould you wi&s;h to &s;ee me wretched,</Q>
&s;aid he;
<Q>you have re&s;olved to love me no longer, and it is but rea&s;onable that I &s;hould try to forget you.</Q></P>
<P>He would have proceeded in this &s;train; but turning to look on her, he &s;aw her &s;weet face over&s;pread with tears. "Oh my Dolly," cried he,
<Q>we are very cruel to each other; but I am mo&s;t to blame: can you pardon me, my deare&s;t: &s;ay you can; alas, I know I do not de&s;erve it.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly's heart was &s;o oppre&s;t, that &s;he was not able to &s;peak; but &s;he held out her hand to her young lover, who &s;eizing it eagerly, pre&s;t it to his lips,
<Q>Yes, I will love
<PB N="207" REF="216">
you,</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q>though you &s;hould hate me; I will love you to my late&s;t breath.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly perceiving Sophia and her &s;i&s;ter coming up to them, drew away her hand ha&s;tily; but look|ed on him at the &s;ame time, with inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s: Sophia told him with a &s;mile, that &s;he was afraid his aunt would be im|patient: upon which he made his bow, and ha&s;tened back to her.</P>

<P>FANNY now left her &s;i&s;ter alone with Mi&s;s Darnley, who perceiving that &s;he had been weep|ing, a&s;ked her tenderly the cau&s;e.
<Q>Oh my dear mi&s;s, &s;aid the poor girl blu&s;hing and pre&s;&s;ing her hand, if I had but a little of your prudence and good &s;en&s;e, I &s;hould obey my father better; but when one has once given one's heart, it is very difficult to recal it.</Q></P>
<P>"Very true, my dear," &s;aid So|phia;
<Q>therefore one ought not to be in ha&s;te to give it.</Q></P>
<P>"I hope," interrupted Dolly with an anxious look,
<Q>you have ob&s;erved nothing in Mr. William to make you change your good opinion of him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="218">"Quite the contrary," &s;aid So|phia,
<Q>I believe him to be a good, and I am &s;ure he is a &s;en&s;ible youth: nay more, I believe he has a &s;incere regard for you; and that,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;ighing,
<Q>is &s;aying a great deal, con&s;idering what rea&s;on I have to judge un|favourably of men: but, my dear, I would have you keep your pa&s;&s;ion &s;o far &s;ubjected to your rea&s;on, as to make it not too difficult for you to obey your father, if he is fully determined to refu&s;e his con&s;ent. I know,</Q>
added &s;he, with a gentle &s;mile,
<Q>That it is ea&s;ier to be wife for others than for our&s;elves; but I know it is not impo&s;&s;ible for a heart in love to follow the dictates of rea&s;on: I think &s;o highly of Mr. Law|&s;on's under&s;tanding and goodne&s;s, that I am per&s;uaded he would not lay an unrea&s;onable command
<PB N="210" REF="219">
upon you, and by what I could collect from &s;ome hints dropt by Mrs. Gibbons, and the little di&s;cour&s;e I had with your lover, the old gentlewoman is wholly to blame.</Q></P>
<P>"Did Mr. William tell you," &s;aid Dolly,
<Q>what was the occa&s;i|on of their quarrel.</Q></P>
<P>"No," replied Sophia:
<Q>I &s;hould be glad to hear it from your&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>"Well," re&s;umed Dolly,
<Q>tak|ing her under the arm, let us go to our dear oak then, and there we &s;hall be out of &s;ight; but I am impatient to know how you met, and what conver&s;ation you had.</Q>
Sophia &s;atisfied her curi|o&s;ity, diverting her&s;elf a little with the old lady's hard words, and her &s;trict regard to ceremony.</P>
<P>"Ah," &s;aid Dolly,
<Q>it was tho&s;e hard words, and the clut|ter
<PB N="211" REF="220">
&s;he made about ceremony and decorum, that occa&s;ioned all our unhappine&s;s; for as I told you, mi&s;s, &s;he was well enough plea&s;|ed with her nephew's choice, &s;aying, that he was in the right to marry like a gentleman, and prefer per&s;on and breeding to money: however, &s;oon after &s;he came into the country, &s;he &s;hew|ed her&s;elf a little di&s;&s;atisfied with my education, and &s;aid, that as my father was a gentleman and a &s;cholar, he ought to have taught his daughters a little Greek and Latin, to have di&s;tingui&s;hed them from meer country girls,</Q></P>
<P>"Your mother, I &s;upppo&s;e," &s;aid Sophia,
<Q>laughed at this no|tion.</Q></P>
<P>"It does not become me," &s;aid Dolly, to blame my mother;
<Q>but to be &s;ure &s;he took great delight in ridiculing Mrs. Gibbons: in|deed
<PB N="212" REF="221">
it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to help &s;miling now and then at her hard words, and her formal po|litene&s;s; but my mother, as Mr. William often told me with great concern, carried her raillery &s;o far that his aunt would cer|tainly be offended with it at la&s;t; and &s;o indeed &s;he was, and grew every day cooler, with regard to the marriage. This di&s;gu&s;ted my mother more, &s;o every thing wore a melancholy appearance: at length Mrs. Gibbons broke out one day violently, upon my mother's &s;ending a di&s;h of tea to another gentlewoman before her. I &s;aw a &s;torm in her countenance, and dreading the con&s;equence, I made ha&s;te to carry her, her di&s;h my&s;elf, but &s;he refu&s;ed it &s;corn|fully, and then began to attack my mother in her &s;trange lan|guage, upon her want of breed|ing,
<PB N="213" REF="222">
and ignorance of the rules of <HI>precendency,</HI> that was her word. My mother at fir&s;t only laughed, and rallied; but when the re&s;t of our vi&s;itors was gone, and Mrs. Gibbons only remained, the quarrel grew &s;erious. My mother, who was out of patience with her folly, &s;aid &s;ome &s;evere things, which provoked Mrs. Gib|bons &s;o much, that &s;he ro&s;e up in a fury, and declared &s;he would never more any have <HI>collection</HI> with &s;uch vulgar creatures. At that moment my father and Mr. Wil|liam, who had been walking to|gether, came into the room: they both were exce&s;&s;ively &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the di&s;order which ap|peared among us: and poor Mr. William, who was mo&s;t appre|hen&s;ive, turned as pale as death: he gave me a melancholy look, as fearing what had happened, and
<PB N="214" REF="223">
had &s;carce courage enough to a&s;k his aunt what was the matter? Mean time, my mother, in a laughing way gave my father an account of what had happened, repeating &s;ome of Mrs. Gibbons's &s;trange words, and made the whole affair appear &s;o ridiculous, that Mrs. Gibbons in a great fu|ry, flung out of the hou&s;e, de|claring that from that moment &s;he broke of any <HI>treati&s;e</HI> of mar|riage between her nephew and me; and that if he continued to make his addre&s;&s;es to me, &s;he would make a will, and leave all her money to a di&s;tant relation. Mr. William was obliged to fol|low his aunt; but he begged my father's leave to return as &s;oon as he had &s;een her &s;afe home. When he came back, he implored my father, with tears in his eyes, not to forbid his &s;eeing me: he &s;aid
<PB N="215" REF="224">
the lo&s;s of his aunt's fortune would give, him no concern if he dur&s;t hope that it would make no alteration in my father's re&s;o|lutions, &s;ince his own little in|heritance was &s;ufficient to main|tain us comfortably. My father was plea&s;ed with his generous af|fection for me, and &s;aid a great many obliging things to him, as did my mother likewi&s;e: &s;o that we thought our misfortune not &s;o bad; but the next day old far|mer Gibbons came plodding to our hou&s;e, and with a great deal of con|fu&s;ion and aukwardne&s;s, told my father that he was very &s;orry for what had happened; but &s;i&s;ter had changed her mind, and would not let her nephew marry, and he was afraid if he di&s;obliged her &s;he would leave all her money to &s;trangers; &s;o he begged him to give his &s;on no encouragement,
<PB N="216" REF="225">
but to tell him plainly he mu&s;t obey his aunt and his father; and he &s;aid he was &s;ure his &s;on would mind what my father &s;aid to him more than any body el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am in pain for poor Mr. Law&s;on,</Q>
&s;aid Sophia.
<Q>What a boori&s;h &s;peech was this!</Q></P>
<P>"My father," re&s;umed Dolly,
<Q>&s;aid afterwards, that if it had not been for the concern he felt for me and Mr. William, he &s;hould have been exce&s;&s;ively diverted with the old man's &s;implicity; but he an&s;wered him gravely, and with great civility: he promi&s;ed him that the affair &s;hould go no farther; that I &s;hould receive no more vi&s;its from his &s;on; and that he would talk with him, and endeavour to make him &s;ub|mit patiently to what his father and his aunt had determined for him. The old man thanked my
<PB N="217" REF="226">
father a thou&s;and times over for his kindne&s;s, and after a great many bows and &s;crapes he went away. My father was as good as his word: he laid his com|mands on me to think no more of Mr. William, and forbad me to &s;ee or &s;peak to him; and when Mr. William came next, he took him with him into his &s;tudy, and talked to him a long time. He acknowledged that Mr. William had oftener than once moved him even to tears; but for all that he did not relent, and we were not allowed &s;o much as to &s;peak to each other alone, for fear we &s;hould take any mea&s;ures to meet in private. This I thought very &s;evere,</Q>
pur&s;ued Dolly, &s;igh|ing,

<P><PB N="218" REF="227">"I cannot blame your father," &s;aid Sophia,

<P>POOR Dolly was ready enough to admit a hope &s;o plea&s;ing, and felt her heart more at ea&s;e than it had been a long time. As for William, his aunt's extravagant prai&s;es of Sophia, and &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions which &s;he dropped, inti|mating that &s;he &s;hould be plea&s;ed if he could make him&s;elf accept|able to &s;o fine a lady, hinted to him a &s;cheme which might afford him the means of &s;eeing his mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;ometimes: he &s;eemed there|fore to li&s;ten with &s;atisfaction to the&s;e dark overtures made by his aunt, and upon her &s;peaking &s;till plainer, he &s;aid it would be pre|&s;umption in him to think that a

young lady &s;o accompli&s;hed as Mi&s;s Darnley would look down upon him; and be&s;ides, he had no op|portunity of improving an ac|quaintance with her, being for|bid Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e, at her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The old woman, plea&s;ed to find he made &s;o little oppo&s;ition to her de&s;ire, told him,
<Q>That he would have opportunities enough of &s;ee|ing and conver&s;ing with the lady; &s;he often walks out, &s;aid &s;he, either in the fore&s;t or the fields about the hou&s;e: cannot you throw your&s;elf in her way, and acco&s;t her politely, as you very well know how; and, to <HI>felicitate</HI> your &s;ucce&s;s, I will let her know that I am willing to receive the honour of a vi&s;it from her, though this is again&s;t all the rules of decorum, for it is my part to vi&s;it her fir&s;t, &s;he being

had not dared to indulge him&s;elf frequently in the&s;e &s;tolen inter|views, le&s;t his aunt being inform|ed of them &s;hould take mea&s;ures to engage Mr. Law&s;on to keep his daughter under a greater re&s;traint; but now he continually haunted the park, the wood, and the fields about Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e: here he could not fail of often &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ometimes of &s;peaking to her unob&s;erved by any one.</P>
<P>Dolly never failed to chide him as often as this happened, for thus laying her under a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|obeying her father's injunctions; but &s;he took no pains to &s;hun tho&s;e places where &s;he was almo&s;t &s;ure of meeting him; and her chiding was &s;o gentle, that he was convinced &s;he was not greatly offended.</P>
<P>Sophia happening to meet him
<PB N="223" REF="232">
one morning, while he was thus &s;auntering about, &s;he enquired for his aunt, and hearing from him how de&s;irous the old gentlewoman was of &s;eeing her, &s;he who was full of her benevolent &s;cheme, and eager to put it in execution, de|layed her vi&s;it no longer than till the afternoon.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons con&s;idered this as a proof of her nephew's &s;incerity, and was in &s;o good a humour, that &s;he li&s;tened without any &s;igns of di&s;plea&s;ure, to the prai&s;es which Sophia artfully introduced of Dolly; and even &s;ometimes joined in them. Sophia thought this a very favour|able beginning, and went away full of hope that &s;he &s;hould &s;ucceed in her de&s;ign: but while &s;he was thus endeavouring to make others happy, her &s;i&s;ter was preparing a new mortification for her.</P>
<P>Sir Charles continued to vi&s;it
<PB N="224" REF="233">
Mrs. Darnley as u&s;ual: he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours every day at her hou&s;e, and while he applauded him&s;elf for the &s;teadine&s;s of his re&s;olution, not to follow his mi&s;tre&s;s, he perceived not his own weakne&s;s in &s;eeking every alleviation of her ab|&s;ence. He went to the hou&s;e where &s;he had formerly dwelt, be|cau&s;e every object he &s;aw in it brought her dear idea to his mind: he loved to turn over the books he had &s;een her read, to &s;it in tho&s;e places where &s;he u&s;ed to &s;it: he was tran&s;ported when he &s;aw any thing that belonged to her; and when he was not ob&s;erved by the inqui&s;itive eyes of Harriot, he in|dulged his own in gazing upon So|phia's picture, faintly as it expre&s;&s;ed the attractive graces of the original: he endured the trifling di&s;cour&s;e of Mrs. Darnley, and the in&s;ipid gaiety of Harriot, and left all other
<PB N="225" REF="234">
company and amu&s;ements to con|ver&s;e with them, that he might hear &s;omething concerning Sophia; for he had the art, without &s;eeming to de&s;ign it, to turn the di&s;cour&s;e fre|quently upon her, and thus drew from the loquacious mother all he de&s;ired to know, without appearing to be intere&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley knew not what judgment to form of his a&s;&s;iduity in vi&s;iting her, and vainly endeavoured to penetrate into his views. As for Harriot, who had no idea of tho&s;e refinements of tenderne&s;s, which influenced Sir Charles's conduct on this occa&s;ion, &s;he concluded that her charms had once more en&s;laved him, and exulted in her fancied conque&s;t the more, as it was a triumph over her &s;i&s;ter, who had been the occa&s;ion of &s;o many mor|tifications to her.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o ea&s;y or &s;o fallacious
<PB N="226" REF="235">
as the belief that we are beloved and admired; our own vanity helps the deceit, where a deceit is in|tended: and a coquet who has a double portion of it, willingly de|ceives her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Harriot was now fully per&s;uaded that Sir Charles had forgot Sophia, and was wholly devoted to her. Impatient to in&s;ult her with the news of his change, &s;he propo&s;ed to her mother to make her a vi&s;it: Mrs. Darnley immediately con&s;ent|ed, not becau&s;e &s;he was very de&s;i|rous to &s;ee her daughter, but be|cau&s;e every thing that wore the face of amu&s;ement was always ac|ceptable to her. Sir Charles, upon being made acquainted with their intention, offered to accommodate them with his chariot; and al|though he only de&s;ired them coldly to pre&s;ent his compliments to So|phia, yet when he reflected that
<PB N="227" REF="236">
they would &s;oon &s;ee and conver&s;e with her, he could not help envy|ing their happine&s;s; and it was with great difficulty he conquered him&s;elf &s;o far as to forbear going with them.</P>
