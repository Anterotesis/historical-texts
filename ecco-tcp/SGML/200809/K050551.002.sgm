<HEAD>DIALOGUE XI.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IN our la&s;t conver&s;ation we had the hi&s;tory of an ambitious woman. Let us re&s;ume the &s;ub|ject; let us cur&s;orily examine the pa&s;&s;ion of ambition.</P>
<P>The word Ambition, like the word pride, may be taken both in an ill and a good meaning. It is u&s;ually applied to tho&s;e de&s;tructive actions which are in&s;pired by a love of fame, regardle&s;s of the means; which root out the nations, and de&s;olate the earth, that the people who remain may tremble and admire. When it takes this cour&s;e, ambition is the mo&s;t pernicious of all the pa&s;&s;ions; becau&s;e the mi&s;eries with which it teems are &s;uppo&s;ed glorious and bene|ficial to the conquerors; who, therefore, never neglect to prai&s;e, and almo&s;t idolize him who leads them to victory. The leader fails not to return
<PB N="2" REF="9">
this fal&s;e prai&s;e&mdash;he is the fir&s;t of heroes, and they are the brave&s;t of troops. Thus each is dilated with imaginary virtues, for actions the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive, the mo&s;t intolerable, and the mo&s;t wicked that man can commit.</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h for a lively picture of the effects of this pa&s;&s;ion, and the horrors I have ju&s;t hinted at, turn to the hi&s;tory of Sylla and Caius Marius, or, indeed, to the hi&s;tory of any great and powerful people, and you will &s;oon be &s;atiated.</P>
<P>Ambition is the mo&s;t active principle in the mind, and its effects are frequently prodigious: Many per&s;ons have wilfully devoted their lives to it, by committing crimes for which they knew they &s;hould &s;uffer; chu&s;ing rather to endure tortures, and have their names recorded in infamy, than to die and be for|gotten. Such were Ero&s;tratus, who fired the Tem|ple of Diana, at Ephe&s;us; Hermoxles, who killed Philip, King of Macedon; and many others.</P>
<P>Numerous are the examples too of tho&s;e who, in&s;pired by this pa&s;&s;ion, have been inclined to obtain it by virtuous means, but who could not re&s;i&s;t vi|cious opportunities of gaining their purpo&s;es. Ju|lius Cae&s;ar, Pompey, Alexander, Pi&s;i&s;tratus, &amp;c. &amp;c. gave, at different times, evident proofs of their &s;en&s;e of, and re&s;pect for, virtue. They committed likewi&s;e the mo&s;t horrible crimes and deva&s;tations in pur&s;uit of glory.</P>
<P>The love of fame &s;eems never to have been more predominant in any per&s;on than in Alexander the
<PB N="3" REF="10">
Great. He took Cali&s;thenes, a man famous for his eloquent writings, with him to his wars, that he might be a witne&s;s of his actions, and record them for po&s;terity. When he came to the tomb of Achilles, at Sigaeum, he exclaimed, "Oh fortunate hero, thou had&s;t a Homer to make thy prai&s;e im|mortal!" So lively was his own &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;ion, that he could not forbear e&s;teeming it in others. He had heard of a certain Indian, who&s;e &s;kill in archery was &s;o great, that he could &s;hoot his arrows through a ring at a great di&s;tance. This man was taken pri&s;oner, and brought to Alexander, who de&s;ired him to exhibit &s;ome proofs of his dexterity; this the Indian peremptorily refu&s;ed: at which Alexander was &s;o enraged, that he commanded him to be taken away and &s;lain. Being que&s;tioned by the &s;oldiers, as they were leading him to death, concerning the rea&s;on of his ob&s;tinacy, the Indian told them, he had been long out of practice, and was afraid he &s;hould not be able to equal his former exploits. Alexander immediately ordered him to be relea&s;ed, gave him his liberty, and loaded him with pre&s;ents: admiring the greatne&s;s of that &s;pirit that would &s;uffer death rather than lo&s;e renown.</P>
<P>The word ambition, when applied to a good in|tention, we u&s;ually call emulation; a word too cold to expre&s;s actions eminently virtuous. The follow|ing tale will fully explain what I would have you under&s;tand by Ambition in each &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>

<HEAD>AMBITION. KOREM and ZENDAR: A Tartarian Tale.</HEAD>
<P>CORDUBA, King of Teran, in Great Tar|tary, was a Prince adored by his &s;ubjects, who&s;e felicity he con&s;tantly laboured to promote, during a very long reign. Covered with glory, and bending under the infirmities of old age, his care was to fix upon a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who &s;hould cau&s;e him to be the le&s;s regretted by his people. It was his pre|rogative to elect one: and, having no &s;on, he was obliged, according to the law of Tartary, to com|mit the &s;ceptre to him whom he &s;hould chu&s;e to marry his daughter, provided he were of the blood of Tamerlane.</P>
<P>Akebar, King of Balk, and Mameluke, Sultan of Cari&s;m, pretended, with equal ardor, to a match that would double their re&s;pective powers; and, pre|&s;uming that Corduba would declare in favour of him who&s;e enmity was mo&s;t to be dreaded, each of them threatened to appear at the head of an army, to make good, at Teran, his demand for Almanzaris and her rich dowry. The old King, having con|&s;idered what was the fitte&s;t cour&s;e to be taken, deter|mined for war, and convoked the States of his king|dom, in order to acquaint them with his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>There were now, at the court of Teran, two younger brothers, Princes of the blood of Tamer|lane, who&s;e per&s;onal merit &s;eemed to render them worthy of the highe&s;t fortune. They entertained
<PB N="5" REF="12">
the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion for Almanzaris; but, having nothing but their birth and qualifications to recom|mend them, they had not yet dared to declare their intention. The King had ob&s;erved what re&s;traint they put upon them&s;elves, in order to conceal their &s;entiments, and generou&s;ly attributed this re&s;pectful deportment to the account of their other merits.</P>
<P>The grandees having po&s;ted up to the capital from all parts, and the deputies of the people repaired to the palace, the wi&s;e Corduba addre&s;&s;ed them in the&s;e terms:</P>
<P>"I have not yet lived too long, my people: for, each day of my life, by being employed in pro|moting the advantage of my &s;ubjects, has been with|out reproach. But, as my infirmities no longer allow me to live for your &s;akes, it is time for me to depart; or, at lea&s;t, until it plea&s;es God to cut me off from the number of the living, I ought to employ the few days he grants me, in endeavouring to prevent your being injured by my death."</P>
<P>The good King was interrupted by the &s;ighs and tears of the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>"Akebar and Mameluke wi&s;h to reign over you, continued the aged Monarch. They are de&s;titute of all right to my throne, as well as my daughter; yet they threaten to acquire both by force of arms. I am a King, I am a father, O Teranites! and I know what &s;ort of hu&s;band is proper for my daugh|ter; and what Sovereign my &s;ubjects ought to wi&s;h for. Akebar and Mameluke are alike unworthy of
<PB N="6" REF="13">
my choice; and, whatever may be their force, it is better to have them for enemies than for ma&s;ters. Illu&s;trious de&s;cendants of the great Timur! brave Korem! intrepid Zendar! to you I commit the care of pre&s;erving the Teranites from oppre&s;&s;ion. Divide between you the forces of my kingdom, and march again&s;t my enemies. The head of my people and the hu&s;band of my daughter mu&s;t be an hero: Contend both of you for this title with a noble emu|lation: He that &s;hall have de&s;erved it, at the end of this war, &s;hall be King of the Teranites and the hu&s;band of Almanzaris."</P>
<P>Corduba di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly. They an&s;wered him with &s;houts of applau&s;e. He di&s;patched orders for Korem and Zendar to be obeyed throughout Teran, as if he him&s;elf were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Zendar laboured with extraordinary diligence in augmenting the army he was to command: He won the hearts of the &s;oldiers by liberalities, and animated the officers by marks of di&s;tinction and the mo&s;t flat|tering hopes: He collected va&s;t quantities of pro|vi&s;ions and ammunition, erected magazines, exer|ci&s;ed his levies, and took the field, as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on was favourable. It was his lot to march again&s;t Mameluke. As the petty republics, that lay between the kingdoms of Teran and Cari&s;m, might &s;uffer them&s;elves to be wrought upon by the promi&s;es, or intimidated by the menaces of the Sultan, Zendar made &s;ure of them by &s;urpri&s;ing their towns, putting garri&s;ons in their fortre&s;&s;es, and
<PB N="7" REF="14">
&s;eizing their arms; and, having nothing more to fear from the&s;e petty &s;tates, which he had rendered incapable of mole&s;ting him, he poured like a torrent into the kingdom of Cari&s;m.</P>
<P>Mameluke was too well acquainted with the pa|cific temper of Corduba to expect &s;uch vigorous proceedings. He had not even a&s;&s;embled his army, when Zendar, ma&s;ter of the field, had made &s;everal great towns open their gates to him. The General of the Teranites, equally &s;kilful and active, attacked &s;uch places as &s;hut their gates again&s;t him: He con|tinued his approaches &s;o artfully, carried them on &s;o vigorou&s;ly, and &s;tormed the breaches with &s;o much bravery, that, in a few days, the mo&s;t re&s;olute gar|ri&s;ons &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Already Zendar was in &s;ight of Cari&s;m, when the Sultan, at the head of an army much more nume|rous, advanced to oppo&s;e his rapid progre&s;s. For &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, there were &s;kirmi&s;hes be|tween large parties, in which the Teranites had always the advantage. The Sultan, con&s;idering tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es as &s;o many pre&s;ages of a general defeat, in ca&s;e he ventured a battle, made propo&s;als for a peace: The principal conditions were, That he would renounce his preten&s;ions to Almanzaris; that he would be the ally of him that &s;hould marry her; that he would render homage to the King of Teran for the territories of Cari&s;m, which Zendar had put under contribution.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15">The Teranite Prince rejected the&s;e propo&s;als as ridiculous; Mameluke, &s;aid he, relinqui&s;hed what he could not any longer hope to obtain, and de&s;ired to become a va&s;&s;al, when he could not avoid be|coming a &s;ubject. The battle was fought under the walls of Cari&s;m, and la&s;ted the whole day. The Sultan behaved like a Prince who&s;e only re&s;ource lay in a victory, and performed prodigies of valour. Zendar acted the part of a great Captain and a brave &s;oldier; more than once, by his per&s;onal bravery, he animated his di&s;ordered broken troops to return to the charge; and, by his profound capacity, he obviated the ill con&s;equences of other unlucky inci|dents. In fine, he fixed fortune to his &s;tandard; his victory was complete. The Sultan, leaving half of his army dead on the field of battle, brought off the flower of the re&s;t into his capital, and there &s;hut him&s;elf up, re&s;olving to be buried in its ruins, if the enemy refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to peace.</P>
<P>Zendar was deaf to the intreaties of the Sultan's deputies. After letting his army re&s;t a few days, he formed his lines of contravallation round the city. He amu&s;ed the Sultan with all the preparations and works requi&s;ite for a regular &s;iege, and, taking the advantage of a dark night, ordered a general &s;calade. The Sultan ran to that &s;ide where the greate&s;t efforts were made, judging that Zendar mu&s;t be there in per&s;on: He beheld this implacable enemy, who, bearing down all that oppo&s;ed him, had already got footing on the counter&s;carp, and was preparing to
<PB N="9" REF="16">
force his way to the rampart. Urged by de&s;pair, or hoping to retrieve all by &s;ingle combat, he cut his way up to the Prince, and challenged him. Zen|dar's fortune did not for&s;ake him; his fir&s;t blow laid Mameluke dead at his feet. The rumour of his death once &s;pread, the Cari&s;mites laid down their arms, and implored the clemency of the con|queror, who, with great difficulty, drew off his fu|rious &s;oldiers from the carnage.</P>
<P>At break of day, Zendar &s;ecured the po&s;ts of the city, cau&s;ed Corduba to be proclaimed Sultan of Cari&s;m, and made the inhabitants &s;wear allegiance to him; and, as it took up no more time to &s;ubdue the re&s;t of the kingdom, than was nece&s;&s;ary to march through it, he returned to Teran towards the end of autumn, and laid at the feet of Almanzaris one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable crowns of Tartary.</P>
<P>While Zendar filled Teran with the fame of his exploits, the Teranites &s;carce remembered that his rival, Korem, had an army under his command; and yet he had laboured indefatigably towards the acqui&s;ition of a title on which his happine&s;s de|pended; but he took a cour&s;e different from Zen|dar's. His fir&s;t care was to di&s;pel the fears and jea|lou&s;ies of the petty republics &s;ituated between the kingdoms of Balk and Teran. As pledges of his fidelity in keeping his word with them, he gave them ho&s;tages, and thereby acquired a right to de|mand ho&s;tages of them. He &s;ent manife&s;toes into the provinces of Balk, &s;etting forth the motives of
<PB N="10" REF="17">
the war, and making Akebar the cau&s;e of all the calamities it might bring upon the people: Be&s;ides which, he ordered tru&s;ty emi&s;&s;aries to lie concealed in the enemy's towns, to mix in company with the citizens, to extol the conduct he propo&s;ed to ob|&s;erve, and to exaggerate every lo&s;s the King might &s;u&s;tain. Thus a&s;&s;ured of the affections of the neu|tral republics, he made no other provi&s;ion for his expedition, but arms and money; and, followed by twenty thou&s;and Teranites, picked out of the mo&s;t robu&s;t and docible in that part of the kingdom which had been a&s;&s;igned him for making levies, he began his march. The punctuality with which he paid for what he required, &s;oon made his camp abound with all kinds of provi&s;ions; the pea&s;ants flocked to him with every thing they could &s;pare; and, thinking them&s;elves happy in a war, that inriched with|out expo&s;ing them to any danger; love and gra|titude attached them to the General, to whom they were indebted for this &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene.</P>
<P>So much caution and moderation gave Akebar lei&s;ure to a&s;&s;emble his forces: He was already on the frontiers, with a prodigious army, not doubting in the lea&s;t that he &s;hould cru&s;h Korem; but he little knew what &s;ort of an enemy he had to deal with. This Prince, being charged to pre&s;erve the Teranites from oppre&s;&s;ion, contented him&s;elf with protecting them. Ever upon the wing with his little army, which he even frequently divided into flying parties, he applied him&s;elf to keeping Akebar in con|tinual
<PB N="11" REF="18">
alarm. He made choice of po&s;ts where he might fight only when he plea&s;ed: He charged his officers to decline every &s;kirmi&s;h that might bring on a general engagement, but not to avoid any other action. By this conduct he &s;ucceeded in &s;top|ping, fatiguing, and con&s;uming that numerous army, which could not move, without being expo&s;ed to the &s;word of the vigilant Teranites.</P>
<P>Akebar, having &s;een all his foragers cut off, and one of his quarters beat up and plundered, re&s;olved to bring the war to a &s;hort i&s;&s;ue, by penetrating into the kingdom of Teran. He entered the territories of the neutral petty republics; but, as he was not di&s;po&s;ed to pay for what he thought he had a right to exact, and as his enemy had the hearts of the people, he &s;oon found him&s;elf in want of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Korem, who had fore&s;een all this, depended on the troops he had left on the frontier, for making head again&s;t the King. As for his part, having cau&s;ed part of his cavalry to take an exten&s;ive cir|cuit, in order to lay under contribution the pro|vinces of Balk, which were quite bare of troops, he followed Akebar in the rear with the re&s;t of his army, ince&s;&s;antly and harra&s;&s;ing him, retarding the arrival of tho&s;e convoys which he could not cut off, and daily reducing his army to greater &s;traits.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants, finding that the &s;oldiers of Akebar u&s;ed them ill, annoyed them in every re&s;pect, and began a kind of war that was more cruelly managed than open ho&s;tilities. The contributions levied by
<PB N="12" REF="19">
the Teranite cavalry, filled the kingdom of Balk with con&s;ternation, and made all the people murmur. The &s;upplies, which Akebar drew from his domi|nions, &s;topped all on a &s;udden; a &s;ickne&s;s broke out in his army; and, to complete his misfortunes, Korem managed &s;o artfully, that he cut off his re|treat home. Thus all hearts fainted in his camp.</P>
<P>In &s;o terrible a &s;ituation Akebar &s;ued for peace, leaving Korem intirely ma&s;ter of the conditions, and re&s;olving to die, &s;hould they prove intolerable: The Teranite Prince &s;ent him this an&s;wer:</P>
<P>"Kings &s;hould make war to e&s;tabli&s;h peace. Promi&s;e, Sir, to ob&s;erve faithfully the alliance with Corduba and the &s;ucce&s;&s;or he &s;hall plea&s;e to appoint, and repair the damage you have occa&s;ioned to the neutral republics and the Teranites. Would to God we could bring the &s;lain to life! Then might all be forgotten."</P>
<P>Akebar, &s;truck with admiration, &s;wore to ob&s;erve the peace; he gave &s;ecurity for the performance of articles; and, in his march back to his capital, he proclaimed every-where, that Korem's virtue was equal to his talents. The Prince, after di&s;banding his army, repaired to Teran, to give an account of his expedition. Corduba, too well informed to be ignorant of any part of Korem's conduct, had al|ready pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence between the two rivals.&mdash;He called together, however, the States of Teran, who being a&s;&s;embled, and the Deputies of Cari&s;m having been called to &s;it with them, Corduba thus &s;poke:</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">"Intrepid Zendar, your courage and conduct have acquired me a new kingdom; but the &s;ubjects, which your conque&s;t procures me, are only enemies in di&s;gui&s;e, whom you add to the number of my children. I will not, by adopting them, introduce di&s;cord into my family. Let the Cari&s;mites have a King, who&s;e love cannot be divided between them and another people."</P>
<P>"Go, brave Zendar, go and reign in Cari&s;m. The terrible effects of your valour have made you dreaded and admired in that fine empire. Let your great talents re&s;t, and add to them virtues of a higher value. The lo&s;&s;es the Cari&s;mites have &s;uffered by your means, ought to be repaired; they will not allow you to indulge your genius, and to exhibit to them a mere conqueror on the throne of their Kings: &s;hew your&s;elf to them as a father, and con&s;train them, by continual benefactions, to ble&s;s the hand that &s;hed their blood."</P>
<P>"As for you, generous Korem, who know how to vanqui&s;h the enemies of the Teranites, and to procure them friends; you, who love peace, under|&s;tand the art of war, and excel in the practice of u&s;eful and amiable virtues, be my daughter's Con|&s;ort; receive my Scepter together with her Hand.

<HEAD>MERCY. Anecdotes of OTTOMAN and ALIVERDI.</HEAD>
<P>OTTOMAN, the fir&s;t Sultan of the Turks, was of &s;o mild a temper, that to this day, at the ceremony of proclaiming the Emperors his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, they wi&s;h them his meekne&s;s. One day his officers brought to him a man that had been found concealed in the Imperial tent with a dagger under his garment. The criminal confe&s;&s;ed that he in|tended to murder the Sultan; and the officers waited impatiently for orders to execute the villain: But Ottoman, whom nothing could warp from his good-nature, &s;aid to the officers, let the wretch go, I cannot re&s;olve to &s;hed blood.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance of unbounded clemency has its value, though it is the effect of temper: But let us &s;ee whether clemency produced by &s;entiment and re|flection is not &s;uperior to it.</P>
<P>Aliverdi, generali&s;&s;imo of the armies of Abbas the Great, King of Per&s;ia, and his prime mini&s;ter, was as good a general and as able a politician, as he was amiable in the capacity of a courtier. From the con&s;tant &s;erenity of his countenance it was
<PB N="17" REF="24">
judged that nothing could ruffle the calmne&s;s of his heart; and virtue di&s;played it&s;elf in him &s;o grace|fully and &s;o naturally, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of his happy temper. An extraordinary incident made the world do him ju&s;tice, and placed him in the rank he de&s;erved.</P>
<P>One day as he was &s;hut up in his clo&s;et, be&s;tow|ing on affairs of &s;tate the hours which other men devote to &s;leep, a courier quite out of breath came in and told him, that an Armenian, followed by a po&s;&s;e of friends, had in the night &s;urprized his pa|lace at Amandabat, de&s;troyed all the mo&s;t valuable furniture in it, and would have carried off his wife and children, doubtle&s;s to make &s;laves of them, had not the dome&s;tics, when the fir&s;t fright was over, made head again&s;t him. The courier added, that a bloody &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued, in which his &s;ervants had the advantage at la&s;t; that the Armenian's friends were all killed upon the &s;pot, but that their leader was taken alive.</P>
<P>I thank thee, Offali<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Prophet mo&s;t revered by the Per&s;ians next to Mahomet.</NOTE>, cried Aliverdi, for afford|ing me the means to revenge &s;o enormous an at|tempt. What! whil&s;t I make a &s;acrifice of my days and my repo&s;e to the good of Per&s;ia; while, through my cares and toils, the meane&s;t Per&s;ian lives &s;ecure from inju&s;tice and violence, &s;hall an audacious &s;tranger come to injure me in what is mo&s;t dear to me! Let him be thrown into a dun|geon,
<PB N="18" REF="25">
and give him a quantity of wretched food &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve him for the torments to which I de&s;tine him. The courier withdrew, charged with the&s;e orders to tho&s;e who had the Armenian in cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>But Aliverdi &s;oon growing cool again, cried out, What is it, O God, that I have done! Is it thus that I maintain the glory of &s;o many years? Shall one &s;ingle moment eclip&s;e all my virtue! That &s;tranger has cruelly provoked me: But what im|pelled him to it? No man commits evil merely for the plea&s;ure of doing it: There is always a motive, which pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice pre&s;ents to us under the ma&s;k of equity; and it mu&s;t needs be &s;omething of this kind that blinded the Armenian to the dread|ful attempt. Doubtle&s;s, I mu&s;t have injured the wretch!</P>
<P>He di&s;patched immediately an expre&s;s to Aman|dabat, with an order under his own hand, not to make the pri&s;oner feel any other hard&s;hip than the privation of liberty. Still tranquil, after this act of moderation, he applied him&s;elf again to public bu|&s;ine&s;s, till he &s;hould have lei&s;ure to &s;ift this bu|&s;ine&s;s to the bottom. From the &s;trict inquiries he ordered to be made, he learned, that one of his inferior officers had done very con&s;iderable damage to the Armenian, con&s;idering the mediocrity of his fortune; and that he him&s;elf had &s;lighted the com|plaints brought again&s;t him. Ea&s;ed by this di&s;co|very, he called for the Armenian, who&s;e counte|nance
<PB N="19" REF="26">
expre&s;&s;ed more confu&s;ion than terror, and pa&s;&s;ed this &s;entence upon him.</P>
<P>"Vindictive &s;tranger, there was &s;ome ground for thy re&s;entment; thou did&s;t think I had ju&s;tly incurred thy hatred; I forgive thee the injury thou ha&s;t done me. But thou ha&s;t carried thy vengeance to exce&s;s; thou ha&s;t attacked a man whom thou oughte&s;t to re&s;pect; nay, thou ha&s;t attempted to make thy vengeance fall upon innocent heads: therefore I ought to puni&s;h thee.

<HEAD>LOVE. IDRIS and MAHMUT.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the dancers of the palace, in the reign of Abbas the Great, King of Per&s;ia, there was a young maid, named Idris, whom the ma&s;ter of the revels, on the report of her charms, had &s;ent for from Ca&s;bin to I&s;pahan. Her mother being of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he had followed that way of life: But as &s;he honourably di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf from her female companions, &s;he demon&s;trated that virtue is practicable in every &s;ituation, however &s;lippery or dangerous it may be.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="28">Scarcely had Idris appeared on the theatre of the capital, but &s;he found her&s;elf be&s;et by the grandees, who &s;trove to plea&s;e her by the &s;ame means that had won others in that &s;tation. Every one exerted his faculties and addre&s;s, in order to gain the preference over his rivals. But Idris was not to be caught with &s;uch baits. At the palace, at a&s;&s;emblies, in the public walks, and in all places, the di&s;cour&s;e turned upon the new dancer: Every one talked of her beauty, her wit, and her engaging behaviour; and, which was more than they had ever &s;aid of any other of her profe&s;&s;ion, they agreed in acknowledging her to be virtuous. It is the property only of the mo&s;t exalted virtue to gain the re&s;pect and admi|ration of young courtiers. Mahmut conceived a high opinion of Idris's virtue, from the extraordinary effect it produced.</P>
<P>Mahmut bore among the young Lords of the Court the &s;ame character which Idris maintained among the dancers of her &s;ex; proof again&s;t the defects of his equals and the vices of his &s;tation. As &s;oon as he began to appear in the world, he became &s;en&s;ible of the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of that noi&s;y, ob&s;tre|perous giddine&s;s, which mo&s;t young people of qua|lity affect; and being happily prejudiced again&s;t the idle life he &s;aw them lead, he took care not to follow their example, yet without &s;eeming to condemn them. While their days were divided between the toilet, the table, vi&s;its, ladies' bed-chambers, and gaming, he &s;pent the morning in his clo&s;et among
<PB N="22" REF="29">
his books, or with tho&s;e who&s;e conver&s;ation could in&s;truct him better. In the afternoon he frequented the manufactories, and working places about the palace; talked with the able&s;t hands in the &s;everal arts; and ob&s;erved with the utmo&s;t attention how they proceeded in their works. In the evening he went to the Play or other public entertainments, which he enjoyed with the moderation that is ever in&s;epa|rable from ta&s;te and di&s;cernment: After which he repaired to &s;ome of the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;emblies of I&s;pahan, as well to avoid a &s;ingularity that would have rendered him odious, as to acquire a greater &s;hare of the complai&s;ance and politene&s;s which reigned in them. Mahmut's wit, and the u&s;e he made of it, rendered him &s;uperior to tho&s;e who were his equals in birth; and be&s;ides the advantage of a good figure and graceful air, he di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf no le&s;s among them by his natural and acquired talents. Idris could not behold this amiable Per&s;ian without emotion: She immediately &s;hunned all her importunate &s;uitors; and complacently fancying him free from all their faults, &s;he &s;ecretly wi&s;hed that the beauty, which they had &s;o highly extolled, might make an impre&s;&s;ion on him. Her wi&s;hes were met more than half-way: Mahmut &s;oon let her know that he loved her mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately; and her an&s;wer to his declaration, on account of its &s;ingularity, de&s;erves to be given entire.</P>
<P>"Doubtle&s;s you give the name of love (&s;aid &s;he with an enchanting &s;mile) to that which is only an
<PB N="23" REF="30">
effect of your ta&s;te for novelty. I will not, my Lord, go farther at pre&s;ent on this head: 'Tis your bu&s;ine&s;s to fix my judgment. I will ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, though it will give you an unfavourable opinion of me, if you are not the man I take you to be, that I am not di&s;plea&s;ed at your liking me: yet if ever I &s;ee occa&s;ion to alter the idea I have con|ceived of you, hope not that I &s;hall in the lea&s;t in|dulge my inclination. I &s;hall not take it ill, if you give your heart to a more virtuous woman; there|fore do not complain of your lot, if I di&s;po&s;e of mine in favour of any man whom I may find &s;uperior to you in virtue."</P>
<P>Mahmut, &s;truck with admiration and overflowing with joy, laboured to ri&s;e to &s;uch a pitch as might oblige Idris to be con&s;tant to him. He applied him|&s;elf with fre&s;h vigour to acquire the arts and &s;ciences nece&s;&s;ary for a man in his &s;tation. He made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to relieve indigent merit and unfortunate virtue. His humanity, genero&s;ity, capacity and mode&s;ty, were equally con&s;picuous; and Idris abun|dantly rewarded him for all the pains he took to plea&s;e her. Prai&s;e grounded on truth, and coming from the mouth of &s;o charming a per&s;on, filled the tender Mahmut's heart with joy and &s;atisfaction. He read in the eyes of his beauteous mi&s;tre&s;s how dear he was to her: He talked of his attachment, and de&s;cribed its &s;incerity; Idris li&s;tened to him with plea&s;ure, vowed &s;he would make him a ju&s;t return, and thus animated him to give her no occa&s;ion to
<PB N="24" REF="31">
repent her engagement. In the&s;e overflowings of their hearts, which none but true lovers can know and feel the &s;weetne&s;s of, they laid open to each other the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of their &s;ouls. Mah|mut was grieved whenever he took leave of Idris; nor could &s;he bear his ab&s;ence without a vi&s;ible concern: They always parted under the greate&s;t impatience to meet again.</P>
<P>Between two neighbours &s;o powerful as the Grand Signior and the King of Per&s;ia, there can be no long peace: A war &s;oon broke out, and Mahmut was obliged to &s;et out for the army. He waited upon Idris, to deplore with her the dire nece&s;&s;ity that forced them a&s;under: But while he lay at her feet, he dur&s;t not di&s;clo&s;e to her all his grief: The fortitude of the fair one daunted him; he was afraid of le&s;&s;ening him&s;elf in her e&s;teem, by di&s;covering any weakne&s;s. Idris perceived the &s;ore conflict in his brea&s;t, and loved him for it the more inten&s;ely.</P>
<P>Mahmut had not been gone a month, when he gave way to his de&s;ire of an interview with Idris. He &s;lipped away privately from the army, and with the help of relays which he had got ready on the road, he was at the gates of I&s;pahan before they mi&s;&s;ed him in the camp. Alighting at the hou&s;e of one of his old &s;ervants, he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the apparel of a pea&s;ant, that he might not be known in the city; and, impatient of an interview with his Idris, he flew to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="32">The charming maid was &s;itting at her balcony as Mahmut was advancing, and knew him, notwith|&s;tanding his di&s;gui&s;e. Grieved to &s;ee him thus neglect his glory and his duty, &s;he ran directly to her clo&s;et, charging her &s;lave to admit no vi&s;itor whatever. She melted into fears at the weakne&s;s of her lover; but &s;oon recovering her&s;elf, &s;he wrote him the following billet.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>IDRIS to the PEASANT.</HEAD>
<P>"Friend, I know that thou art to be forthwith at the army. Call upon Mahmut, and tell him from me, that I de&s;ire him to remember the con|ditions on which the heart of Idris is to be &s;ecured."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mahmut was too much confounded with the&s;e few words, to a&s;k any que&s;tions of the &s;lave that deli|vered him the billet. He went back to his dome&s;tick's hou&s;e, to put off his di&s;gui&s;e; and fluctuating be|tween admiration, grief, and fear, he repaired again to the army with as much ha&s;te as he had travelled up to I&s;pahan. His chief &s;tudy being to make amends for the fault he had committed, he behaved the re&s;t of the campaign with &s;o much ardor, bra|very and conduct, that he was de&s;ervedly promoted to a higher po&s;t, which the King conferred on him, with the mo&s;t honourable eulogies, at the head of the army. Idris wrote him a congratulatory letter on his promotion, in which, without mentioning his weakne&s;s, &s;he gave him to under&s;tand that &s;he had forgiven him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="33">Mahmut, tran&s;ported with joy, ha&s;tened back to I&s;pahan as &s;oon as the army was ordered into winter quarters; and li&s;tening to no other con&s;iderations but his e&s;teem for the virtuous girl, he entreated her to complete his happine&s;s in becoming his wife. Your wife, my Lord! an&s;wered Idris, with a kind of &s;urprize mixed with indignation: What! would Mahmut forget him&s;elf &s;o far? In di&s;po&s;ing of your heart, you may indeed con&s;ult nothing but your inclination: But when the que&s;tion is to choo&s;e a partner in your dignity and fortune, you are ac|countable to tho&s;e of whom you hold both. I that am ready to &s;acrifice my life, were it nece&s;&s;ary, to pre&s;erve your glory, &s;hall not be in&s;trumental my&s;elf in &s;ullying it.</P>
<P>Sentiments like the&s;e made the pa&s;&s;ionate Mahmut only more pre&s;&s;ing. What are tho&s;e things, &s;aid he, which, create &s;o great a di&s;parity between us? An in&s;tant may deprive me of them: But the dowry which you will bring me, charming Idris, is a ble&s;|&s;ing that depends not on men nor fortune. In uttering the&s;e words, his countenance began to be clouded with grief: Fre&s;h denials drove him to de|&s;pair; he drew his poniard, and was going to plunge it into his brea&s;t. The tender Idris could hold out no longer: Ah! Mahmut, cried &s;he, &s;top your hand, and live: To-morrow I &s;hall be your's; grant me this &s;hort re&s;pite. She could not utter more; tears put an end to her &s;urprize, and &s;topt her &s;peech. A&s;hamed of her weakne&s;s, &s;he broke loo&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="34">
from her lover's arms, withdrew to her clo&s;et, and &s;oon repented the promi&s;e &s;he had made.</P>
<P>In the mean while Mahmut was de&s;perate enough to re&s;olve upon death, if &s;he denied his reque&s;t. The maid, wavering between tender pa&s;&s;ion, and con|cern for the glory of her lover, &s;oon hit upon a de|vice that would reconcile them. While &s;he was free, notwith&s;tanding the meanne&s;s of her condition, &s;he could not in honour give her&s;elf to him, upon any other terms than marriage; and con&s;idering the di&s;|tance which fortune had put between them, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible &s;he could not receive the title of wife with|out di&s;gracing her admirer. She re&s;olved then to remove tho&s;e ob&s;tacles to her Mahmut's happine&s;s, at the expence of what was mo&s;t dear to her. Wrapping her&s;elf up therefore in a long mantle, &s;he left her hou&s;e in the du&s;k of the evening, and &s;old her&s;elf to a dealer in &s;laves. After this &s;he wrote the following letter to Mahmut.</P>

<P>IN our conver&s;ations, children, we have had fre|quent occa&s;ion to mention the Ea&s;tern nations, from the tales which have lately multiplied among us; &s;ome of which I have introduced here, for the &s;ake of their moral intent, as well as for variety. The doctrines of Mahomet being now almo&s;t univer&s;ally received in the Ea&s;t, I thought an account of the man, and his opinions, would tend not only to in|form your minds, but to make you tolerant in your principles. I have, therefore, drawn up the narrative, which I am going to read for your u&s;e and informa|tion.

Afterwards, I mean to give you &s;ome ad|vice relative to &s;uper&s;tition, and its pernicious effects.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of MAHOMET and MAHOMETANISM.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the pa&s;&s;ions incident to man, there is not one who&s;e perver&s;ion and abu&s;e has proved &s;o great a &s;courge as ambition; and of all ambitious men, there is not one, who&s;e hi&s;tory we are acquainted with, who has been &s;o thoroughly de&s;tructive to the rights and privileges of men as Mahomet. Chri&s;|tians have continued, for ages, per&s;ecuting, burn|ing, de&s;troying, and exterminating each other. Mahometani&s;m has prevented this, by rendering its followers &s;uch entire, &s;uch ab&s;olute &s;laves, to one man, that their pa&s;&s;ions and tempers &s;eem &s;unk into an indolence of habit, that is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to be overcome. There are various opinions re&s;pecting the de&s;cent of Mahomet, &s;ome affirming him to have been, originally, a &s;lave, others that he was of the tribe of Cora&s;h, the mo&s;t opulent and powerful of all Arabia, and that he was born at Mecca, and the &s;on of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people of that tribe. This la&s;t is Dr. Prideaux's account, and he appears to have con&s;ulted the be&s;t authorities. Ma|homet, in humble imitation, as we may &s;uppo&s;e, of our Saviour, has two genealogies, with abundance of hard names, one of which goes as far back as Adam, including Abraham, Noah, and the Pa|triarchs.
<PB N="30" REF="37">
It is certain, however, that he was poor in his youth, and became a &s;ervant to a rich mer|chant's widow, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s he tran&s;acted for &s;ome time, and, afterwards, married her. This woman's name was Cadigha, and her wealth was the begin|ning of Mahomet's good fortune: for it does not appear, that Mahomet had any thoughts of erecting a kingdom under the cloak of religion, till he was tolerably advanced in life. There were numerous events and accidents, that made the age of Mahomet the mo&s;t proper of all others for e&s;tabli&s;hing a new religion. The Ea&s;t, in&s;tead of that peaceful &s;loth it now enjoys, was rent into a thou&s;and &s;ects of Arians, Trinitarians, Donati&s;ts, Me&s;torians, Pelagians, Mo|nothelites, Jews, Pagans, &amp;c. &amp;c. Mahomet in his travels into Egypt, and over the Ea&s;t, as a factor to his mi&s;tre&s;s, Cadiga, had ob&s;erved the violence and acrimony of their di&s;putes, and, it is mo&s;t probable, had the good &s;en&s;e to &s;ee their ab&s;urdity. When, in con&s;equence of his wife's fortune, and his own intrigues, he became one of the chief per&s;ons of Mecca, his ambition prompted him to invite men of every character to join him, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to become dependant on him. Mahomet was little better than the chief of a band of robbers, that &s;kulked about the neighbourhood of Mecca, and his fir&s;t appearance in the character of a hero was at the head of the&s;e in the wars the Emperor Heraclius had with the Per&s;ians, in which, it &s;eems, he gained great applau&s;e. There happened a mutiny among
<PB N="31" REF="38">
the Arabian troops, too, and Mahomet put him&s;elf at the head of the factious, by which he became more powerful. Indeed, if we may judge from hi&s;torical relations, it was the ver&s;atility of the Ara|bian temper, and their inherent di&s;po&s;ition to rebel|lions and in&s;urrections, that fir&s;t in&s;pired him with the de&s;ign of becoming a King, and a Conqueror, by turning this di&s;po&s;ition to the advancement of his project; and I have no doubt but every age, every kingdom, afford men &s;ufficiently daring, turbulent, capable, and ambitious, to enact the parts of Crom|well, Mahomet, or Julius Cae&s;ar, were the &s;ame op|portunities and circum&s;tances to occur. Mahomet was peculiarly fortunate, I mean as a re&s;tle&s;s man, who panted for renown by the <HI>be&s;t</HI> or the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of means. The &s;ectaries, that have been mentioned, though their hatred to each other was inveterate and implacable, had yet numerous particulars in which they were all agreed: the &s;trong truths of morality were ever obvious, they ever were and ever will be the &s;ame. Mahomet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an acutene&s;s that taught him how to turn every thing to his own ad|vantage. He took tho&s;e opinions that were mo&s;t general for the ba&s;is of his new doctrine; he pre|tended to have a great re&s;pect for Mo&s;es, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and John the Bapti&s;t. He invented a very agreeable Paradi&s;e, and &s;uch as man would naturally wi&s;h to enjoy, when he is told he may enjoy it with innocence and &s;ecurity. Fruits, flowers, rivers, women, wine, and every earthly happine&s;s, in the
<PB N="32" REF="39">
fulle&s;t perfection, were to be abundant in exce&s;s; and, on the contrary, Hell Torments were mo&s;t liberally denounced again&s;t all unbelievers. Not even do our modern methodi&s;ts make &s;o terrible a u&s;e of future mi&s;ery as did Mahomet. They burn through every chapter of the Alcoran. "We have decorated the Heavens with &s;tars, &s;ays Mahomet, in the Chapter of the Empire, we have cha&s;ed the Devils from thence; but we have prepared an immen&s;e cauldron, and the fire of Hell for the infidels. They hear no|thing but the frightful and horrible voice of rage and de&s;pair, when they are fir&s;t precipitated there, when they are ca&s;t down, when they enter into Hell, troop after troop, and behold the torments, they lament. Tho&s;e who hear them &s;hall a&s;k, What! was there no per&s;on on earth who prophe&s;ied, who preached to you of the pains of Hell? Yes, alas! they &s;hall an&s;wer, but we have given the lye to the preachers; we have &s;aid they were not commanded of God, they were deceivers, who wanted us to be|lieve lies and ab&s;urdities. If we had li&s;tened to them, if we had believed them, we &s;hould not, at this day, have been numbered among the damned. Thus they &s;hall confe&s;s their &s;ins from the depths of Hell." Full of Hell and denunciation is the Alcoran. The pa&s;&s;age I have quoted was the fir&s;t that pre&s;ented it&s;elf on opening the book.</P>
<P>Mahomet was one of tho&s;e enterprizing empirics who &s;aw the credulity, incapacity, and ignorance of man, and felt the power of &s;uch engines.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="40">He was afflicted with the epilep&s;y, and had the hardine&s;s to turn this terrible di&s;ea&s;e to the purpo&s;es of fanatici&s;m. A man who falls down, foams at the mouth, gets up and tells enormous lies, which, by their novelty and improbability, lead the imagina|tion, amazed and &s;tupified with wonder without al|lowing it the liberty to doubt, through the wilde&s;t regions of fable: he who can do this too with ineffa|ble effrontery, is well calculated to enact the part of pretended in&s;piration. Mahomet was as familiar with the angel Gabriel, as Socrates was with his daemon. Every thing was miraculous. Nothing puzzled Mahomet, for he had a fable, or rather an incoherent jumble of lies, to &s;olve every difficulty. The earth was &s;upported by an ox, who&s;e feet were on a white &s;tone; he had his head in the ea&s;t, and his tail in the we&s;t; he had a thou&s;and teeth, and as many horns, between each of which it was a thou|&s;and years journey. Under the white &s;tone that he trod on, was Zohot, a mountain of Hell, of a thou|&s;and years journey al&s;o, which infidels are obliged to a&s;cend to be ca&s;t down; under this are numerous lands and &s;eas; and, at la&s;t, the wind, thunder, and lightening; the bloody &s;ea, Hell clo&s;ed, the fiery &s;ea, the dark &s;ea, the cloudy &s;ea; prai&s;es, glorifications, the throne, the book, the pen, the great name of God!</P>
<P>But though the &s;peculative doctrines of Mahomet were wild and incon&s;i&s;tent, his practical ones were very different; for, except in &s;ome in&s;tances where
<PB N="34" REF="41">
the indulgence of his own lu&s;t or ambition made him le&s;s &s;evere, his morality was rational, ju&s;t, and pro|ductive of order.</P>
<P>Morality is the univer&s;al ba&s;is of religion; mora|lity is a thing &s;o &s;elf-evidently nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of communities, that we find none, however barba|rous, without it. That it is incumbent on men to be ju&s;t and faithful to each other, the gods of all nations, whether of wood or &s;tone, comprehen&s;ible or incomprehen&s;ible, &s;ub&s;tance or chimera, univer|&s;ally allow, becau&s;e the men who have made the&s;e various gods, felt them&s;elves liable to injury, and wanting protection. Hope and fear are the ma&s;ter-keys of the human heart, the incentives to action, and the engines of prie&s;tcraft. They are the &s;word and &s;hield of cunning, and by u&s;ing the&s;e weapons like a ma&s;ter, Mahomet, in reality, conquered greater armies than ever did Amadis de Gaul, Or|lando Furio&s;o, or any other hero of romance. Whoever reads the Alcoran, will frequently forget that he is reading a book to which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;tranger, and that inculcates doctrines he is taught to abhor. The bulk of the book is little el&s;e than a recapitulation of Jewi&s;h &s;tories about Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, David, and our great Redeemer. The&s;e are inter&s;per&s;ed with promi&s;es, threatenings, and doctrinal points. The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference between mahometani&s;m and chri&s;tianity is in the de&s;cription of the life to come; and however refined, however platonic the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem may be, that
<PB N="35" REF="42">
of Mahomet is certainly much better calculated to gratify the appetites, and delight the imaginations of men in a &s;tate of nature, becau&s;e the plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es are common to all. The rivers of Mahomet flow with wine and oil, with milk and honey. The plains of his heaven are rich in flowers, and &s;picy groves, and full of the trees of concupi&s;cence, &s;idras and telech. His groves abound with birds of beau|tiful plumage, the mo&s;t enchanting &s;ong, and the fine&s;t flavour. The trees yield the mo&s;t delicious fruits. The fountain Zelzibil contains a wine of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, which neither cau&s;es head|achs nor drunkenne&s;s; and every thing is &s;erved up to them by young men hand&s;omer than the angels. To make the&s;e delights &s;till more de&s;irable, they are to have virgins beautiful as the hyacinth or pearl, free from every blemi&s;h, and entirely unpolluted by angel, man, or devil; &s;itting in the &s;hades, with brea&s;ts white as &s;now; and large beauteous black eyes fixed upon their hu&s;bands, with whom they continue in amorous dalliance for fifty years, and are to have their fill of plea&s;ure in the pre&s;ence of God, who is not a&s;hamed. Another account of Mahomet's heaven &s;ays, the ground is of gold, en|amelled with emeralds and hyacinths, planted with every fruitful tree, fertilized with &s;treams of wine, with milk and honey. The day is of a thou&s;and years, and the year of forty thou&s;and days. The moment the ble&s;&s;ed form a wi&s;h, it &s;hall be gratified; they &s;hall be cloathed in all colours except green, which
<PB N="36" REF="43">
is the holy colour of Mahomet. They &s;hall all be of the &s;tature of Adam, the re&s;emblance of Chri&s;t, and &s;hall never increa&s;e or dimini&s;h. As &s;oon as they enter Paradi&s;e, the dainty liver of the fi&s;h al|behbut &s;hall be &s;et before them, and whatever el&s;e they de&s;ire. They &s;hall have no more need to ex|onerate than the child in the womb, for they &s;hall vent all &s;uperfluities by per&s;piration, which &s;hall be as &s;weet as mu&s;k. They &s;hall eat for delight but not for hunger. They &s;hall eat of all fle&s;h except the fle&s;h of &s;wine, which is unclean.</P>
<P>Let the mind be once impre&s;&s;ed with the truth of the Mahometan doctrine, and the reality of &s;uch a hea|ven, and it will a&s;&s;uredly wi&s;h to become an inhabitant. After painting &s;o luxurious a place, Mahomet, to further his ambitious views of conque&s;t, made pre|de&s;tination a part of his &s;y&s;tem, by which he taught that no man could die till his time &s;hould come; that tho&s;e warriors who fell in battle, infallibly went to heaven; that tho&s;e who ran away were in&s;tigated to cowardice by the temptations of the devil, and for whom there was no &s;alvation. It was impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;tronger incitement to courage than &s;uch a paradi&s;e, and &s;uch a certainty of enjoyment.</P>
<P>His hell was as tremendous as his heaven was in|viting; there were fountains of &s;calding water for the damned to drink; the tree ezecum for them to feed upon, which &s;hould burn in their bellies like fire; they were to have chains of &s;eventy cubits in length, bound round and round them to keep them
<PB N="37" REF="44">
&s;afe. The cinders that the fire of hell ca&s;t forth, were as large as towers; the floor was of burning brim&s;tone, that &s;ent forth &s;tinking and &s;uffocating flames; it was full of pits of boiling pitch and &s;ul|phur, in which the damned were daily dipped; every thing was loath&s;ome, every thing terrible; a col|lection of objects from which nature &s;hrinks with horror.</P>
<P>Mahomet &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s every art of leading the imagination of the enthu&s;ia&s;t into the world of wonders. Thus his Alcoran was &s;o powerful, that could the devils only hear it, they &s;hould be con|verted; nay more, they were once to hear it, and ONCE to repent. Whoever would read the Alcoran a thou&s;and times over, &s;hould have women with eye|brows as large as the rainbow. The virgins who were the lot of the ble&s;&s;ed, were &s;o bright, that were one of them to come forth at midnight, in the ab|&s;ence of the &s;un, &s;he would illumine the whole earth, and were &s;he to &s;pit into the &s;ea, the &s;alt water would in&s;tantly become &s;weet. The keys of para|di&s;e were, in number, three&s;core and ten thou&s;and, each &s;even thou&s;and miles long, and kept by the angel Gabriel, who was not able to open one of the gates without invoking the name of God, and of Mahomet the friend of God. The firmament is &s;upported on the horn of a buffalo, who, when he &s;tirs, occa&s;ions earthquakes. When God &s;wears, &s;ays Mahomet, he is obliged to &s;wear by beings in|ferior to him&s;elf, as by the blowing winds the
<PB N="38" REF="45">
watery clouds, the &s;ailing &s;hips, the twilight and the dawn, the guilty &s;ouls, the devils, the order of angels, the Alcoran, &amp;c. The following is the Mahometan Hi&s;tory of the La&s;t Day:&mdash;At the Day of Judgment God &s;hall command the angel of death to &s;lay every creature; and God &s;hall a&s;k if any thing remain alive? Adriel, the angel of death, &s;hall an&s;wer "no|thing but my&s;elf;" and God &s;hall &s;ay, go thy ways between Paradi&s;e and Hell, and kill thy&s;elf; and Adriel &s;hall go, with his foul wings, and, pro&s;trate on the earth, &s;hall &s;trangle him&s;elf with &s;uch hide|ous bellowing, that the very angels would be terrified were they alive, and the world &s;hall he empty forty years. Then God &s;hall a&s;k, where now are the migh|ty men, the princes of the people? who&s;e is now the kingdoms, the empires and the powers? Then &s;hall he rai&s;e up Seraphiel, and &s;ay to him, take thou this trumpet (the length of the trumpet is five hun|dred years journey) and go to Jeru&s;alem, and &s;ound; and he &s;hall &s;ound, and all &s;ouls &s;hall come forth, and the bones of the dead &s;hall be gathered together; and forty years after that, he &s;hall &s;ound again, and the bones &s;hall be cloathed with fle&s;h and &s;inews; and after forty years, he &s;hall blow a third bla&s;t, and all &s;ouls &s;hall repo&s;&s;e&s;s their bodies; and a fire from the we&s;t &s;hall drive every creature to Jeru&s;alem, where they &s;hall &s;wim in their own moi&s;ture forty years. After which they &s;hall come, with much vexation, to Adam, and &s;hall &s;ay, father Adam! father Adam! wherefore ha&s;t thou begotten us to the&s;e mi&s;eries
<PB N="39" REF="46">
and torments? why &s;uffere&s;t thou us to hang be|tween hope and fear? Pray to God that he will determine for us between paradi&s;e and hell. And Adam &s;hall excu&s;e him&s;elf by rea&s;on of his unworthi|ne&s;s and di&s;obedience, and &s;end them to Noah; and Noah &s;hall &s;end them to Abraham, and Abraham to Mo&s;es, and Mo&s;es to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and they &s;hall &s;ay to him, oh! Spirit, Word, and Power of God, let thy pity move thee to make interce&s;&s;ion for us. And he &s;hall an&s;wer, that which ye a&s;k ye have lo&s;t. I was indeed &s;ent in the power of God and the word of truth, but ye have erred; ye have made me God, which is more than ever I preached unto you; but go to the la&s;t and greate&s;t of prophets, go to Mahomet. Then &s;hall they turn to Mahomet, and &s;ay, oh! faithful me&s;&s;enger! oh! friend of God! we have &s;inned; hear us, holy prophet, thou art our only hope. Then &s;hall Gabriel and Mahomet go to the throne of God; and God &s;hall &s;ay, I know where|fore ye are come; far be it from me that I &s;hould not hear the prayer of my Faithful One. Then &s;hall a bridge be made over hell, whereon &s;hall be &s;et a balance, in which every man's works &s;hall be weighed; and tho&s;e who are &s;aved, &s;hall pa&s;s &s;afely over the bridge; and the re&s;t &s;hall fall into hell; and in that day there &s;hall be an hundred and twenty troops of men, and every troop &s;hall be in length the journey of a thou&s;and years, and in breadth five hundred; and three troops only &s;hall be found faithful. Then &s;hall death be transformed into a ram, and they
<PB N="40" REF="47">
&s;hall place him between heaven and hell, and there &s;hall ari&s;e much &s;trife between the inhabitants of hell and the inhabitants of heaven concerning death, but the inhabitants of heaven &s;hall prevail, and &s;hall &s;lay death.</P>

<P>Yes, Charles, he was exceedingly wicked. I know no wickedne&s;s equal to that of di&s;&s;eminating lies under the ma&s;k of religion: that is, of propa|gating incoherent and contradictory opinions, of infu&s;ing mental terrors into the minds of the &s;imple

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. The Ru&s;&s;ians believe St. Nicholas &s;wam down the river Volga on a mill-&s;tone; the Gentoos wor&s;hip a cow; the Egyptians a cat; the Papi&s;ts a wafer. The&s;e things are ridiculous, but not pernicious, till they are rendered &s;o by the arts of ambition, or the zeal of enthu&s;ia&s;m. Super&s;tition &s;hould be pitied, not per&s;ecuted. A King of Siam had a white elephant, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;upernatural powers, and he, therefore, made it the object of his adoration. The King of Pegu was a cunning and ambitious Prince, that wanted a pretext to make war upon the King of Siam. For this purpo&s;e he likewi&s;e pretended to believe in the white elephant; ordained it &s;acrifices, paid it di|vine honours, and, at la&s;t, &s;ent to demand it of the King of Siam, that it might be &s;een and wor|&s;hipped by all the people of Pegu. The demand
<PB N="42" REF="49">
was peremptorily refu&s;ed by the King of Siam. This was fore&s;een by the King of Pegu, who had previou&s;ly taken his mea&s;ures, and having a va&s;t army in readine&s;s, immediately invaded Siam, which he conquered; added it to his own kingdom, and took the white elephant, which, that he might &s;eem to be con&s;i&s;tent, he cau&s;ed all his &s;ubjects to adore. The religious wars of Chri&s;tians, Jews, and Turks, are not unlike the war of the white elephant; reli|gion is the pretence, but ambition is the motive. Men go to battle, and afterwards, with miraculous effrontery, to the temples of the God of Benevo|lence, to render thanks for having obtained the power to murder and de&s;troy their own &s;pecies; nay more, they pretend to fa&s;t, and to pray that they may induce the God of Mercy to be of their party.</P>
<P>Prote&s;tants them&s;elves are &s;ufficiently weak, &s;uffi|ciently ab&s;urd, and have far, far too much of the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit remaining among them. Let us, however, do them the ju&s;tice to acknowledge, they are more rational, and more tolerant, than other &s;ectaries. We are but too well acquainted with the per&s;ecutions of the Catholics, their inqui&s;itions, and their ma&s;&s;acres; yet do not let us cheri&s;h our&s;elves, or endeavour to in&s;pire others with hatred towards them: their leaders, their rulers, and their in&s;truc|tors only are guilty.</P>
<P>The following account of a Turki&s;h fa&s;t forcibly and lamentably de&s;cribes the power of that &s;uper|&s;tition of which Mahomet was the founder. The

The Grand Sultan being apprehen&s;ive, that the hand of the great God is &s;tretched out again&s;t his government, his &s;ubjects, and his empire, &s;ince he permits them to be oppre&s;&s;ed and tormented by their enemies the chri&s;tians, who have vanqui&s;hed them &s;everal times, both by &s;ea and land, and taken from them a large extent of country; and all this, as it appears to him, becau&s;e the mu&s;|&s;ulmans have corrupted them&s;elves, and become too confident of their power: To appea&s;e the wrath of God, therefore, and of his prophet Mahomet, he expre&s;sly orders, That on Friday, after new moon, in the fifth, &s;ixth, and &s;eventh months, all and &s;in|gular his &s;ubjects &s;hall keep a rigorous fa&s;t all that day, and ab&s;tain from meat and drink, from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, till that of the &s;tars. On that day, the Mufti, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ervants, cloathed

with penitential garments of hair-cloth, with down-ca&s;t eyes, beards uncombed, and all in tears, &s;hall repair fir&s;t to the public places, and afterwards to the mo&s;ques, crying with all their &s;trength, "Ya mofateth ilabwab," [i. e. Open the gates of thy fa|vour.] In the i&s;land of Mecca, the prophet's coffin &s;hall be laid open, and expo&s;ed to public view upon &s;ilver tre&s;&s;els, perfumed with incen&s;e, and filled with the bones of &s;ervants and &s;pahi's killed in the battle; that the prophet, moved by &s;o great and &s;o &s;en&s;ible a lo&s;s, may be induced to appea&s;e the wrath of Heaven. This to be performed three Fridays, the coffin car|ried through the &s;treets and in the fields; and all the pilgrims and inhabitants of the mo&s;ques, with the Chiefs of the trades, &s;hall make the round &s;even times, &s;inging, with a doleful voice, the Canticle of Lamentation, on account of this terrible de&s;truc|tion. No in&s;trument of mu&s;ic &s;hall be heard, but cries of &s;orrow and univer&s;al mourning; and, on the la&s;t day of fa&s;ting, a &s;olemn and general pro|ce&s;&s;ion &s;hall be made, ten miles round, in the fol|lowing order:</P>

<HEAD>SUPERSTITION: Or SCARMENTADO.</HEAD>
<P>MY name is Scarmentado; my father was go|vernor of the city of Candia, where I came into the world in the year 1600, and I remember that one Jro, a &s;tupid and &s;currilous poet, wrote a copy
<PB N="47" REF="54">
of doggrel ver&s;es in my prai&s;e, by which he proved me de&s;cended from Minos in a direct line; but my father being di&s;graced &s;ome time after, he wrote another poem, by which it appeared I was no longer a-kin to Minos, but the de&s;cendant of Pa&s;iphae and her lover.</P>
<P>When I was fifteen years old, my father &s;ent me to Rome, to fini&s;h my &s;tudies. Mon&s;ignor Profonde, to whom I was recommended, was a &s;trange kind of man, and one of the mo&s;t terrible &s;cholars breath|ing; he took it into his head to teach me the cate|gories of Ari&s;totle, and I narrowly e&s;caped his throw|ing me into the category of his minions. I &s;aw many proce&s;&s;ions and exorci&s;ms, and much oppre&s;|&s;ion. Signora Fatelo, a lady of no rigid morals, was fooli&s;h enough to like me: &s;he was wooed by two youthful monks, the Rev. Father Poignardini, and the Rev. Father Aconiti, but &s;he put an end to the preten&s;ions of both of them, by granting me her good graces; yet, at the &s;ame time, I narrowly e&s;caped being excommunicated and poi&s;oned. I left Rome, exceedingly well plea&s;ed with the archi|tecture of St. Peter's church.</P>
<P>I went to France, in the reign of Lewis, &s;urnamed the Ju&s;t; the fir&s;t thing I was a&s;ked was, whether I cho&s;e a reli&s;h of the Mar&s;hal d'Ancre, who&s;e body the public had roa&s;ted, and which was di&s;tributing very cheap to &s;uch as de&s;ired the happine&s;s of ta&s;ting. This nation was at that time torn to pieces by civil wars, occa&s;ioned &s;ometimes by ambition, &s;ometimes
<PB N="48" REF="55">
by controver&s;y; and tho&s;e inte&s;tine broils had for the &s;pace of forty years deluged the mo&s;t delightful country in the world with blood. Such were the liberties of the Gallican church: the French, &s;aid I, are naturally wi&s;e; what makes them deviate from that character? They are much given to joking and plea&s;antry, and yet they commit a ma&s;&s;acre; happy that age in which they &s;hall do nothing but joke and make merry.</P>
<P>From hence I &s;et out for England; the &s;ame fa|natical temper excited here the &s;ame furious zeal; a &s;et of devout Roman Catholics, had re&s;olved, for the good of the church, to blow up the king, the royal family, and the parliament, with gunpowder, and thereby free the nation from tho&s;e heretics. I was &s;hewn the &s;pot where the ble&s;&s;ed Queen Mary, daughter to Henry VIII. had cau&s;ed above five hun+dred of her &s;ubjects to be burnt alive. A pious Hibernian prie&s;t a&s;&s;ured me, it was a very laudable action, fir&s;t, becau&s;e tho&s;e they had burned were Engli&s;h; and, &s;econdly, becau&s;e they were wretches who never took any holy water, and did not believe in St. Patrick.</P>
<P>From England I went to Holland, in hopes of find|ing more peace and tranquillity among a more fleg|matic people. At my arrival at the Hague, I was entertained with the beheading of a venerable old patriot, the prime mini&s;ter Barnevelt, who was the mo&s;t de&s;erving man in the republic. Struck with pity at the &s;ight, I a&s;ked what his crime was, and
<PB N="49" REF="56">
whether he had betrayed the &s;tate? He has done wor&s;e, replied a preacher with a black cloak, he believes that we can be &s;aved by good works, as well as by faith. You are &s;en&s;ible, that were &s;uch &s;y&s;tems &s;uffered to prevail, the commonwealth could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and that a &s;evere law is nece&s;&s;ary to check and refute &s;uch &s;candalous errors. A deep Dutch politician told me with a &s;igh, that &s;uch com|mendable actions could not la&s;t for ever: Alas, Sir! &s;aid he, our people naturally incline towards tole|ration; &s;ome day or other they will adopt it; I &s;hudder at the thought: believe me, Sir, pur&s;ued he, it is a mere chance that you actually find them &s;o laudably and zealou&s;ly inclined as to cut off the heads of their fellow-creatures for the &s;ake of reli|gion. Such were the lamentable words of the Dutchman; for my own part, I thought proper to abandon a country, who&s;e &s;everity had no compen|&s;ation, and therefore embarked for Spain.</P>
<P>I arrived at Seville in the fine&s;t &s;ea&s;on in the year. The court was there, the galleons were arrived, and all &s;eemed to proclaim joy, abundance, and profu|&s;ion. I e&s;pied at the end of a beautiful alley, full of orange and lemon-trees, a va&s;t concour&s;e round an amphitheatre richly adorned; the king, the queen, the infants and infantas, were &s;eated under a &s;tately canopy, and over again&s;t that augu&s;t family, another throne, higher and more magnificent, had been erect|ed. I told one of my travelling companions, that unle&s;s that &s;uperb throne were dedicated to the Deity,
<PB N="50" REF="57">
I could not &s;ee the u&s;e of it; but the&s;e indi&s;creet words being overheard by a grave Spaniard, I paid dear for having uttered them. In the mean time, I imagined we were to be diverted with a carou&s;al, wre&s;tling, or bull-baiting; when I perceived the grand inqui|&s;itor a&s;cend that throne, and be&s;tow his ble&s;&s;ing upon the king and people. Then appeared an army of monks, filing off two by two; &s;ome were white, others were black, grey, and brown; &s;ome were &s;hod, and &s;ome bare-footed; &s;ome had beards, and &s;ome had none; &s;ome were with cowls, and &s;ome without. Then came the executioner, followed by about forty wretches, guarded by a world of gran|dees and alguazils, and covered with garments, upon which were painted flames and devils. The&s;e fel|lows were Jews, who would not altogether be com|pelled to abandon the law of Mo&s;es; and Chri&s;tians who had married their godmothers, or perhaps re|fu&s;ed to wor&s;hip Neu&s;tra Dama d' Atocha, or to part with their money in favour of the brothers Hiero|nymians. Prayers were &s;aid very devoutly, after which all tho&s;e wretches were tortured and burnt: which concluded the ceremony, to the great edifi|cation of all the royal family.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night, while I was going to bed, two me&s;&s;engers from the inqui&s;ition came to my lodg|ings with the holy Hermandad. They embraced me tenderly, and, without &s;peaking a word, carried me out of the hou&s;e, and conducted me into a dun|geon, not incommoded by heat, adorned with a cu|rious
<PB N="51" REF="58">
crucifix, and a mat in&s;tead of a bed. After I had been there &s;ix weeks, the father inqui&s;itor &s;ent his compliments, and de&s;ired to &s;ee me: I obeyed the &s;ummons: he received me with open arms, and after having embraced me with more than paternal fondne&s;s, told me, he was very &s;orry they had put me in &s;o bad a lodging, but that all the apartments happening to be full, it was impo&s;&s;ible to give me a|nother; adding, however, that he hoped I &s;hould be better taken care of another time. He then a&s;ked me very lovingly, whether I knew why I was put in there. I told the reverend father, I &s;uppo&s;ed it was for my &s;ins. Well, my dear child, replied he, but for what &s;in? make me your confident&mdash;&s;peak. I did all I could to bethink my&s;elf of &s;ome mi&s;de|meanor, but in vain; upon which, he made me re|collect my imprudent words: in &s;hort, I recovered my liberty, after having undergone a &s;evere di&s;ci|pline, and paid 30,000 reals. I went to take leave of the grand inqui&s;itor; he was a very polite man, and a&s;ked me how I reli&s;hed the holidays they had given me? I told him they were delightful, and at the &s;ame time went to pre&s;s my companions to quit this enchanting country. They had time enough, during my confinement, to learn all the great at|chievements of the Spaniards, for the &s;ake of reli|gion. They had read the memoirs of the famous bi&s;hop of Chiapa, by which it appears, that ten millions of infidels had been murdered in America to convert the re&s;t. I imagined that bi&s;hop might ex|aggerate
<PB N="52" REF="59">
a little, but &s;uppo&s;ing the victims were but half that number, the &s;acrifice was &s;till admirable.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;agreeable adventures I had met with in my travels, determined to fini&s;h my tour, and accordingly embarked for Turkey, fully re&s;olved never more to intermeddle with other people's affairs, nor give my judgment about public &s;hews. The&s;e Turks, &s;aid I, to my companions, are a &s;et of unbaptized mi&s;creants; and of cour&s;e more cruel than the reverend fathers of the inqui&s;ition. Let us be &s;ilent among the Mahometans.</P>
<P>I arrived at Con&s;tantinople, where I was &s;trangely &s;urprized to &s;ee more Chri&s;tian churches than in Candia; but much more &s;o, to &s;ee al&s;o a numerous train of monks, permitted to offer their prayers freely to the Virgin Mary, and to cur&s;e Mahomet, &s;ome in Greek, others in Latin, and &s;ome in Arme|nian. How rea&s;onable are the Turks! exclaimed I. Whil&s;t the Chri&s;tian world &s;tains a &s;potle&s;s reli|gion with blood, the&s;e infidels tolerate doctrines which they abhor, without mole&s;tation or inhuma|nity. The Grecian and Latin Chri&s;tians were at mortal enmity in Con&s;tantinople, and like dogs that quarrelled in the &s;treets, per&s;ecuted each other with the utmo&s;t violence. The Grand Vizir protected the Greeks, who&s;e patriarch accu&s;ed me before him of having &s;upped with the Latins, and I was mo&s;t charitably condemned by the divan, to receive one hundred blows with a lath, upon the &s;ole of the foot, with permi&s;&s;ion, however, to be excu&s;ed for 500 &s;e|quins.
<PB N="53" REF="60">
The next day the Grand Vizir was &s;trangled; and the day following, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who was for the Latin party, and who was not &s;trangled till a month afterwards, condemned me to the &s;ame pu|ni&s;hment, for having &s;upped with the Grecian pa|triarch: and, in &s;hort, I was reduced to the &s;ad ne|ce&s;&s;ity to frequent neither the Latin nor the Greek church. To make my&s;elf amends, I determined to make love to a young Turki&s;h la&s;s, who &s;eemed to have a di&s;po&s;ition as gentle, kind, and compa&s;&s;ionate in private, as it was pious and devout in the mo&s;que. One night, as I was pleading my pa&s;&s;ion, and com|plaining of her cruelty, &s;he &s;uddenly exclaimed, <HI>Oh alla, alla, alla.</HI> The&s;e are the &s;acramental words of the Turks, which I mi&s;took for the &s;oft tran&s;ports of love, and therefore cried out in my turn, <HI>Oh alla, alla, alla</HI>; upon which &s;he &s;aid, "Let Mahomet be glorified, you are a Turk." In the morning the iman came to perform the initiating ceremony, but as I made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, the cady, who certainly was a very loyal gentleman, told me he intended to have me impaled. I pre&s;erved my religion, &amp;c. by a thou&s;and &s;equins, and fled into Per&s;ia, firmly re|&s;olved never to go to the Latin or Grecian ma&s;s, or to &s;ay <HI>alla, alla, alla,</HI> in Turkey.</P>
<P>At my arrival at I&s;pahan, I was a&s;ked which I was for, white or black &s;heep? I an&s;wered, that the fle&s;h of a white or black &s;heep was equal to me, provided it was tender. It &s;hould be known, that the factions of the white and black &s;heep &s;till di|vided

the Per&s;ians, who imagined I meant to laugh at both parties, in&s;omuch that I had &s;carce entered the city gates, when I had a &s;ad affair to extricate my&s;elf from; which I did however with a good num|ber of &s;equins, and by their means got &s;afe out of the hands of the&s;e &s;heep.</P>
<P>I went as far as China with an interpreter, who informed me, that it was the only country where one might live freely, gaily, and peaceably. The Tartars had rendered them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it with fire and &s;word, and the reverend fathers me Je&s;uits, on one &s;ide, and the reverend fathers the Dominicans, on the other, &s;aid that they drew &s;ouls towards God every day, without any body's knowing it. Sure there never was a &s;et of more zealous converters! for they per&s;ecuted one another by turns; and &s;ent to Rome whole volumes of calumnies, wherein they were reciprocally called infidels and prevari|cators. There was particularly a terrible quarrel among them, about the method of making a bow. The Je&s;uits taught the Chine&s;e to &s;alute their pa|rents after the manner of their country; and the Dominicans, on the contrary, held that they ought to bow to them after the manner of Rome. I hap|pened to be taken by the Je&s;uits for a Dominican, and they told his Tartarian maje&s;ty, that I was the Pope's &s;py. The &s;upreme council immediately or|dered the prime mandarin, who ordered a &s;erjeant, who ordered four guards to arre&s;t and bind me, with all the ceremony u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions. I was
<PB N="55" REF="64">
brought, after one hundred and forty genu-flexions, before his maje&s;ty, who a&s;ked me, whether I really was the Pope's &s;py, and whether it was true, that his holine&s;s intended to come in per&s;on to dethrone him? I an&s;wered, that the Pope was a prie&s;t, three|&s;core and ten years of age; that he lived four thou|&s;and miles di&s;tant from his &s;acred Tartaro-Chine&s;e maje&s;ty; that he had about two thou&s;and &s;oldiers, who mounted guard with an umbrella; that he never dethroned any body; and, in &s;hort, that his maje&s;ty might &s;leep in quiet. This was the la&s;t un|fortunate adventure I met with in the whole cour&s;e of my travels. I was &s;ent to Macao, where I em|barked for Europe.</P>
<P>I was obliged, in order to refit my &s;hip, to put into a harbour, on the coa&s;t of Golconda. I laid hold of that opportunity, to go and &s;ee the court of the great Aureng-zebe, &s;o much renowned for its wonderful magnificence: he was then at Delhi; and I had the good fortune to &s;ee him the day of that pompous ceremony, in which he received the Heavenly Pre&s;ent &s;ent him by the &s;heriff of Mecca, viz. the broom, with which they had &s;wept the holy hou&s;e, the Caaba, and the Beth alla. That broom is a &s;ymbol which &s;weeps away all uncleanne&s;s of &s;oul. Aureng-zebe had no occa&s;ion for it, &s;ince he was the mo&s;t pious man in Indo&s;tan. It is true, he had cut his brother's throat, poi&s;oned his father, and put to death, by torture, about twenty rayas, and as many omrahs; yet nothing was talked of but his
<PB N="56" REF="65">
devotion, which, they &s;aid, was without equal, ex|cept that of his mo&s;t &s;acred maje&s;ty Muley I&s;mael, the mo&s;t &s;erene emperor of Morocco, who never failed to &s;trike off &s;everal heads, every Friday after prayers.</P>
<P>To all this I &s;poke not a word; my travels and adventures had taught me to bridle my tongue; and I was very &s;en&s;ible, it was not mine to decide be|tween the piety of the emperors of India and Mo|rocco.</P>
<P>I had not yet &s;een Africa; but whil&s;t I was de|bating with my&s;elf, whether it was better to &s;atisfy this la&s;t inclination, or &s;ail for Italy, my &s;hip was taken by the negroes, and I was, of cour&s;e, carried thither. Our captain railed again&s;t the captors, a&s;king them the rea&s;on why they thus outrageou&s;ly violated the law of nations? They replied, Your no&s;e is long, and Our's is flat; your hair is &s;traight, and our wool is curled; you are white, and we are black; con|&s;equently we ought, according to the &s;acred and unalterable law of nature, to be ever enemies.&mdash; You buy us on the coa&s;t of Guinea, as if we were not human creatures, then treat us like bea&s;ts, and with repeated blows con&s;train us to an eternal dig|ging into the mountains, in order to find a ridicu|lous yellow du&s;t, of no intrin&s;ic value, and not worth a good Egyptian onion; therefore when we meet with you, and happen to be &s;tronge&s;t, we make you our &s;laves, and force you to till our ground, or el&s;e we cut off your no&s;e or ears. We had nothing to &s;ay
<PB N="57" REF="66">
again&s;t &s;o wi&s;e a di&s;cour&s;e. I was employed to till the ground of an old negro woman, having no incli|nation to lo&s;e either my no&s;e or my ears; and, after a twelvemonth's &s;lavery, was redeemed by &s;ome friends I had written to for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een the world, and all that is great, good, and admirable in it, I re&s;olved to return to Candia, where I married pre&s;ently after my arrival, and &s;oon became an example to devotees and jealous hu&s;bands, by the profound taciturnity and tranquillity which I ob&s;erved upon all occa&s;ions. To &s;ay the truth, I found matrimony, when compared to what I had &s;een and &s;uffered, a very tolerable evil.</P>

<P>After I had heard them all, I &s;aid, one cannot hear you &s;peak of the plea&s;ures you have had in going over the world, without feeling an extreme de&s;ire of travelling. But the dangers that travellers are expo&s;ed to, take from me the inclination of
<PB N="59" REF="68">
&s;eeing other countries. If one could, added I, &s;miling, go from one end of the world to the other, without meeting with unlucky accidents on the way, I &s;hould &s;et off to-morrow from Surat. At the&s;e words, which made all the company laugh, the &s;tranger &s;aid to me; Seigneur Malek, if you have a de&s;ire to travel, and if the danger alone of meeting with robbers hinders you from re&s;olving to do &s;o, I will teach you, when you will, a way to go from king|dom to kingdom, without any danger. I believed he was in je&s;t; but after dinner he took me a&s;ide, and told me that the next morning he would come to me, and &s;hew me &s;omething very extraordinary.</P>
<P>He did not fail: he came again to me, and &s;aid, I will keep my word with you; but you will not &s;ee the effect of my promi&s;e the&s;e two or three days, for it is a work that cannot be done to-day. Send one of your &s;laves for a joiner, and let them both bring boards with them; which was done immediately.</P>
<P>When the joiner and the &s;lave were come, the &s;tranger bid the joiner make a che&s;t &s;ix feet long, and four broad. The workman went pre&s;ently to work; the &s;tranger, on his part, was not idle; he made a great many pieces of the machine, the vices and the &s;prings. They worked all day long, and the joiner was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: the &s;tranger &s;pent the day following to place the &s;prings, and to perfect the work.</P>
<P>At three days end the che&s;t was fini&s;hed; it was covered with a Per&s;ian carpet, and carried into the
<PB N="60" REF="69">
country, whither I went with the &s;tranger: who &s;aid to me; &s;end away your &s;laves, and let us &s;tay here alone, I will have none near but your&s;elf to be witne&s;s of what I do. I ordered my &s;laves to go home, and I &s;taid alone with the &s;tranger. I longed to know what he would do with this ma|chine; he at length got in it, and at the &s;ame time the che&s;t rai&s;ed it&s;elf up from the ground, and cut the air with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s; in one moment it &s;prung a great way from me, and the next was again at my feet.</P>
<P>I cannot tell you how much I was &s;urprized at this prodigy. You &s;ee, &s;aid the &s;tranger to me, getting out of the machine, a very ea&s;y carriage, and you ought to be per&s;uaded, that, travelling after this manner, one need not fear being robbed on the road. This is the method I would have you take to travel in &s;afety. I will make you a pre&s;ent of this trunk; you may make u&s;e of it when you have a mind to go into foreign countries. Think not, con|tinued he, that there is any inchantment in what you have &s;een: 'tis not by cabali&s;tick words, nor by virtue of a tali&s;man, that this che&s;t rai&s;es it&s;elf in the air. Its motion is made by an ingenious arti|fice, that &s;hews the power of mechanics, of which I am a perfect ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I thanked the &s;tranger for &s;o rare a pre&s;ent, and gave him, as an acknowledgment, a pur&s;e full of &s;equins. Inform me, &s;aid I to him afterwards, how I mu&s;t do to &s;et this che&s;t in motion: I will teach
<PB N="61" REF="70">
you that pre&s;ently, an&s;wered he. At the&s;e words he made me go into the machine with him; touched a &s;pring, and pre&s;ently we were lifted up in the air. Then &s;hewing me what method was to be taken to guide it right; in turning this vice, &s;aid he to me, you go to the right, and in turning that, you go to the left; by touching this &s;tring you a&s;cend, and by touching that you de&s;cend. I made trial of it my&s;elf; I turned the vices, and touched the &s;prings; the che&s;t, effectually obedient to my hand, went which way I plea&s;ed, and ha&s;tened or &s;lackened the motion as I managed. After having made a great many wheelings about in the air, we took our flight towards my hou&s;e, and de&s;cended into my garden; which we ea&s;ily did, becau&s;e we had taken off the carpet that covered the machine, which had a great many holes through it, as well to admit the air, as to look through.</P>
<P>We were at home before my &s;laves, who were enough &s;urprized to &s;ee us return. I locked the che&s;t up in my apartment, where I kept it with as much care as if it had been a trea&s;ure; and the &s;tranger went away as content with me, as I was with him. I continued to divert my&s;elf with my friends, till I had &s;pent all my patrimony. I began al&s;o to borrow, in&s;omuch that I in&s;en&s;ibly found my&s;elf loaded with debts. As &s;oon as it was known in Surat that I was ruined, I lo&s;t my credit, nobody would lend me any thing; and my creditors, impa|tient to have their money again, gave me notice to
<PB N="62" REF="71">
pay it. Not knowing any longer which way to turn my&s;elf, and by con&s;equence being liable to troubles and affronts, I had recour&s;e to my che&s;t: I drew it one night out of my apartment into my yard, I got into it, with &s;ome provi&s;ions, and the little money I had left. I touched the &s;pring that made the machine mount; then turning one of the vices, I went far enough from Surat, and from my creditors, without fear of their &s;ending any officers after me.</P>
<P>I made the che&s;t go all that night as fa&s;t as po&s;|&s;ible, and I believed that I &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the wind in &s;wiftne&s;s. At day-break, I looked through a hole to &s;ee where I was, and perceived nothing but moun|tains and precipices, a dry country, and a frightful de&s;ert; I could di&s;cover no appearance of an habi|tation. I continued to travel through the air all that day and the night following. The next day I found my&s;elf over a very thick wood, nigh which there was a very fine town &s;ituated in a plain of great extent.</P>
<P>I &s;topt to look at the town, as well as at a mag|nificent palace, that offered it&s;elf to my view at the end of the plain. I de&s;ired pa&s;&s;ionately to know where I was, and had already thought on a way to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity, when I &s;aw in the fields a pea&s;ant tilling the ground. I de&s;cended in the wood, where I left my che&s;t, and went towards the hu&s;|bandman, of whom I a&s;ked how they called the town. Young man, an&s;wered he, one may &s;ee you
<PB N="63" REF="72">
are a &s;tranger, &s;ince you know not that this town is called Gazna; the equitable and valiant King Ba|haman makes it the place of his re&s;idence. And who lives, &s;aid I to him, in that palace that we &s;ee at the end of the plain? The King of Gazna, re|plied he, has built it to keep his daughter the Prince&s;s Schirine in, who is threatened by her ho|ro&s;cope to be deceived by a man. Bahaman, to elude this prediction, built this palace, which is of marble and &s;urrounded with deep ditches of water. The gate is &s;teel of China; and be&s;ides that, the King keeps the key of it; there is a numerous guard that watches night and day, to hinder any man from going in. The King goes once a week to &s;ee the Prince&s;s his daughter, and then returns to Gazna. Schirine has no company in this palace, but a governe&s;s and &s;ome maiden-&s;laves.</P>
<P>I thanked the pea&s;ant for his information, and went towards the town. When I was almo&s;t ar|rived there, I heard a great noi&s;e, and pre&s;ently &s;aw many hor&s;emen, magnificently cloathed, and all mounted on very fine hor&s;es that were richly ac|coutred. I perceived, in the middle of that &s;tately cavalcade, a lu&s;ty man, who had on his head a crown of gold, and who&s;e cloaths were covered with diamonds. I judged that he was the King of Gazna, who was going to &s;ee the Prince&s;s his daughter, and I under&s;tood in the town that I was not deceived in my conjecture.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="73">After I had taken a turn or two about the town, and &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity a little, I remembered my che&s;t; and though I had left it in a place where I had rea&s;on to think it &s;afe, yet I was unea&s;y. I went from Gazna, and I could not be &s;atisfied, till I came where it was. Then I was at ea&s;e, I eat with a good appetite what was le&s;t of my provi|&s;ion, and the night coming on, I re&s;olved to &s;pend it in the wood. I doubted not but I &s;hould &s;leep well; for neither my debts, nor the ill condition I found my&s;elf in, gave me much unea&s;ine&s;s: never|thele&s;s I could not &s;leep; what the pea&s;ant had told me of the Prince&s;s Schirine was always in my thoughts. Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I, that Bahaman &s;hould be afraid of a frivolous prediction? Was it nece&s;&s;ary to build a palace to &s;hut up his daughter in? Was &s;he not &s;afe enough in his? Be&s;ides, if a&s;trologers can dive into the ob&s;curity of what is to come, if they can read futurity in the &s;tars, it is in vain to endeavour to elude their predictions, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be accompli&s;hed. If the Prince&s;s of Gazna be prede&s;tined to be deceived by a man, it is in vain for any one to pretend to prevent it.</P>
<P>I was &s;o taken up with thinking on Schirine, who I fancied to my&s;elf was hand&s;omer than all the ladies I had &s;een, though at Surat and Goa I had beheld many of the mo&s;t beautiful women, who had con|tributed not a little to ruin me. But I had a great de&s;ire to try my fortune. I will, &s;aid I, tran&s;port my&s;elf to the top of the Prince&s;s's palace,
<PB N="65" REF="74">
and endeavour to get into her apartment. Perhaps I am the mortal, who&s;e fortunate attempt the a&s;tro|logers have &s;een written in the &s;tars.</P>
<P>I was young, and by con&s;equence heedle&s;s; I wanted not courage: I formed this ra&s;h de&s;ign, and executed it immediately. I rai&s;ed my&s;elf in the air, and guided my che&s;t towards the palace. The dark|ne&s;s of the night was &s;uch as I could de&s;ire. I pa&s;&s;ed, without being perceived, over the &s;oldiers heads, who being po&s;ted about the ditches, kept a &s;trict guard. I de&s;cended upon the roof of the pa|lace, nigh a place where I &s;aw a light. I got out of my che&s;t, and &s;lipt in at a window, that was open to receive the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, into an apartment richly furni&s;hed, where the Prince&s;s Schirine was lying on a brocaded &s;opha. She &s;eemed to me of a dazzling beauty; I found her far excelling the idea I had formed of her. I went near to behold her, but I could not look on &s;o many charms without tran&s;port; I fell on my knees before her, and ki&s;&s;ed one of her delicate hands. She waked that in&s;tant, and perceiving a man in &s;uch a po&s;ture, was fright|ened. She gave a &s;hriek, and pre&s;ently her go|verne&s;s, who lay in the next chamber, came running to her. Mahpeiker, &s;aid the Prince&s;s, come and help me. There is a man! How got he into my apartment? Or rather, are not you an accomplice of his crime? Who I? replied the governe&s;s, your &s;u&s;picion wrongs me! I am not le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than you, to &s;ee this audacious youth here: Be&s;ides, if I

would have favoured his boldne&s;s, how could I have deceived the vigilance of the guards that are about this ca&s;tle? You know there are twenty &s;teel doors to open, before any can get into this apartment; that the royal &s;ignet is upon every lock; and that the King your father has the keys: I cannot com|prehend how this young man has &s;urmounted all the&s;e difficulties.</P>
<P>While the governe&s;s was thus &s;peaking, I thought on what I &s;hould &s;ay to them; and it came in my head to per&s;uade them that I was the prophet Ma|homet. Charming Prince&s;s, &s;aid I to Schirine, let not your&s;elf, or Mahpeiker, be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me here; I am not one of tho&s;e lovers who make u&s;e of gold, and employ every artifice to accompli&s;h their wi&s;hes. I have no de&s;ires that your virtue need to be frightened at; far be all guilty thoughts from me. I am the prophet Mahomet. I could not, without pity, &s;ee you condemned to pa&s;s your youth|ful days in a pri&s;on, and I come to give you my promi&s;e, that I will &s;ecure you from the prediction which Bahaman your father is afraid of. Let him and your&s;elf be both ea&s;y henceforth as to your future de&s;tiny, which cannot but be full of glory and hap|pine&s;s, &s;ince you &s;hall be Mahomet's wife. As &s;oon as the news of your marriage &s;hall be &s;pread abroad in the world, all the Kings of the earth will fear the father-in-law of the great prophet, and all the Prin|ce&s;&s;es will envy your condition.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="78">Schirine and her governe&s;s looked upon one ano|ther at this di&s;cour&s;e, as if to con&s;ult what they ought to think of it. I had rea&s;on to fear, I confe&s;s, that they would not believe me; but women are apt to give into wonders. If you are the holy prophet Mahomet, &s;aid Schirine, you are pure, and free from evil intentions; you will fir&s;t reconcile my father to the match, and then, on an appointed day, perform the ceremonies proper to marriage: but if you are an impo&s;tor, you will betray your wicked de&s;igns. My governe&s;s &s;hall wait in the next apart|ment whenever you vi&s;it me, till this be accompli&s;hed; one &s;hriek from me will alarm her, and &s;he will call the guards, if your actions &s;hould &s;hew you are not what you pretend. I an&s;wered the Prince&s;s by com|mending her virtue, applauding the ju&s;tice of the te&s;t &s;he propo&s;ed, and fixing on that day month for the &s;olemnization of our nuptials, as I hoped by that time to find &s;ome lucky means of deceiving her father into the &s;ame belief. Accordingly Mahpeiker and her mi&s;tre&s;s gave credit to my &s;tory, and be|lieved me to be Mahomet. After having pa&s;&s;ed the be&s;t part of the night with the Prince&s;s of Gazna, I went out of her apartment before it was day-light, not without promi&s;ing her that I would come the following evening. I made ha&s;te to my machine, I put my&s;elf in it, and rai&s;ed my&s;elf very high, that I might not be &s;een by the &s;oldiers. I de&s;cended in the wood; I left my che&s;t, and went to the town, where I bought provi&s;ions for eight days, with magni|ficent
<PB N="68" REF="79">
apparel, a fine turban of Indian linen, with &s;tripes of gold, and a rich girdle. I did not forget e&s;&s;ences and the be&s;t perfumes. I laid out all my money in the&s;e purcha&s;es, without perplexing my&s;elf to know where I &s;hould get more: I thought I could want for nothing, after &s;o extraordinary an adventure.</P>
<P>I &s;taid all that day in the wood, where I em|ployed my&s;elf in perfuming and &s;etting my&s;elf out. When the night was come, I got into my che&s;t, and returned to the top of the Prince&s;s Schirine's palace. I introduced my&s;elf into her apartment as the night before. The Prince&s;s declared &s;he waited for me with much impatience. O great prophet, &s;aid &s;he, I began already to be unea&s;y, and I feared you had forgot your &s;pou&s;e. My dear Prince&s;s, an&s;wered I, could you give way to &s;uch a fear? Since I have plighted you my troth, ought not you to be per&s;uaded that I would love you always? But tell me, replied &s;he, why have you &s;o young a look? I thought that the prophet Mahomet was a venerable old man. You were not deceived, an&s;wered I, 'tis the idea you ought to have of me; and if I &s;hould appear to you &s;uch as I &s;ometimes &s;hew my&s;elf to the faithful, to whom I deign that honour, you would &s;ee me with a long white beard and a bald head; but I thought you would better like a form not &s;uper|annuated: And, for this rea&s;on, I have borrowed the &s;hape of a young man. The governe&s;s joining then in our di&s;cour&s;e, told me, that I had done very
<PB N="69" REF="80">
well; and that whoever would per&s;onate a hu&s;band, cannot appear too agreeable.</P>
<P>I went again from the ca&s;tle towards the end of the night, for fear it &s;hould be di&s;covered that I was a fal&s;e prophet. I returned the next day, and be|haved my&s;elf always &s;o cautiou&s;ly, that Schirine and Mahpeiker could not &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t deceit in me. It is true, the Prince&s;s took in&s;en&s;ibly &s;uch a liking to me, that it contributed very much to make her believe all that I &s;aid to her. When we are favourably prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, we mi&s;tru&s;t not &s;incerity.</P>
<P>In a few days, the King of Gazna, attended by his officers, went to the palace of the Prince&s;s his daughter, and finding his doors all &s;hut, and his &s;eal on the locks, he &s;aid to his vi&s;iers that were with him, all is &s;afe; while the doors of the palace are in this condition, I &s;hall not fear the misfortune my daughter is threatened with. He went alone into the apartment of Schirine, who could not conceal her confu&s;ion at the &s;ight of him. He perceived it, and was willing to know the cau&s;e of it. His curio&s;ity augmented the Prince&s;s's confu&s;ion, who &s;eeing her&s;elf at la&s;t obliged to &s;atisfy him, told him all that had pa&s;t.</P>
<P>You may imagine how much King Bahaman was &s;urprized, when he under&s;tood he was Mahomet's father-in-law. Oh ab&s;urdity! cried he, Oh! my daughter, that you &s;hould be &s;o credulous! O Hea|ven, I now &s;ee very plain, that it is in vain to en|deavour
<PB N="70" REF="81">
to &s;hun the misfortunes you have re&s;erv|ed for us. The fate of Schirine is inevitable. A traitor has deceived her. In &s;aying this, he ru&s;hed out of the Prince&s;s's apartment in affliction, and &s;earched the palace from top to bottom. But his &s;earch was to no purpo&s;e, for he found no marks of di&s;covery. At this his &s;urprize increa&s;ed. Which way, &s;aid he, did this audacious fellow get into the ca&s;tle? 'Tis what I cannot conceive.</P>
<P>Then he called his vi&s;iers and his confidents. They ran at his call, and &s;eeing him agitated, they were afraid. What is the matter, Sir? &s;aid his fir&s;t Mini&s;ter to him; you &s;eem trou|bled. What misfortune does the concern that appears in your looks, declare to us? The King told them all he had been informed of, and a&s;ked them what they thought of the &s;tory. The Grand Vi&s;ier &s;poke fir&s;t. He &s;aid, that the in|tended marriage might be true, though it had the appearance of a fable. That there were &s;ome noble families in the world, who made no difficulty to a&s;|cribe their origin to &s;uch like events, and that for him he looked on the communication that the Prince&s;s had with Mahomet, as a thing very likely.</P>
<P>The other vi&s;iers, in complai&s;ance perhaps to him that &s;poke fir&s;t, were of his opinion: but one of the courtiers declared him&s;elf again&s;t it, in the&s;e terms; I am &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;en&s;ible men give credit to a &s;tory, &s;o little worthy of belief. How can it enter into the heads of men of &s;en&s;e, that our great pro|phet
<PB N="71" REF="82">
&s;hould be capable of coming to &s;eek women in this world, who in his heavenly abode is encom|pa&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t beautiful ones. It is contrary to common &s;en&s;e; and if the King will take my advice, in&s;tead of giving ear to &s;o ridiculous a &s;tory, he &s;hould examine thoroughly into the affair. I am per&s;uaded, that he would pre&s;ently di&s;cover the deceiver, who, under that &s;acred name, has the audaciou&s;ne&s;s to endeavour to &s;educe the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Though Bahaman was naturally credulous; though he took his fir&s;t Mini&s;ter for a man of great judge|ment; and though all his vi&s;iers believed that Schirine was actually betrothed to Mahomet; he de|clared him&s;elf neverthele&s;s for the negative. He re|&s;olved to be informed of the truth of it; but being willing to act with prudence in this affair, and to endeavour to &s;peak with the pretended prophet, in private, he &s;ent his vi&s;iers and his courtiers back to Gazna. Go back, &s;aid he to them, I will &s;tay alone to-night in this ca&s;tle with my daughter. Go; but come hither to me again to-morrow. They all obeyed the King's orders. They went back to the town, and Bahaman waiting for the night, began to a&s;k the Prince&s;s new que&s;tions. He a&s;ked her if I had eaten with her. No, Sir, &s;aid his daughter, I offered him in vain meat and drink, he would not touch them, and I never &s;aw him take the lea&s;t nou|ri&s;hment, nor commit the lea&s;t indelicacy, &s;ince he has u&s;ed to come hither. Relate to me again this adventure, replied he, and hide not from me any
<PB N="72" REF="83">
one particular. Schirine gave him a renewed account of it, and the king, attentive to her relation, carefully weighed every circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the night came on; Bahaman &s;at him&s;elf on a &s;opha, and wax candles were lighted, and placed before him on a marble-table. He drew his &s;cimitar to u&s;e it, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion, to wa&s;h away in my blood the affront done to his honour. He expected me every moment, and in the expectation he was, of &s;eeing me appear all on a &s;udden, I cannot believe he was without trouble.</P>
<P>It happened that night to lighten very much. A great fla&s;h chanced to dart full in the king's eyes, and made him &s;tartle. He went to the win|dow which Schirine told him I came in at, and per|ceiving the air all on fire, he was much perplexed in his thoughts. Though he &s;aw nothing that was unnatural, he could not look on tho&s;e meteors, as the effects of exhalations kindled in the air; he rather believed that the flames announced to earth, the de&s;cent of Mahomet, and that the gates of heaven unfolding to let out the prophet, made the air one luminous body.</P>
<P>In the di&s;po&s;ition the king's mind was, I pre|&s;ented my&s;elf without danger before that Prince. Far from &s;hewing him&s;elf furious when I appear|ed at the window, he was &s;eized with re&s;pect and fear. He let fall his &s;cimitar, ca&s;t him&s;elf at my feet, and ki&s;&s;ing them, &s;aid to me: O great
<PB N="73" REF="84">
prophet, who am I, and what have I done, to de&s;erve the honour to be your father-in-law? I judged by the&s;e words, what had pa&s;&s;ed between the king and the prince&s;s, and I found that the good Bahaman was not more difficult to be deceived than his daughter. I was charmed, to perceive that I had nothing to do with one of tho&s;e penetrating heads who would have made the prophet undergo an examination that would have puzzled him. Taking advantage of his weakne&s;s, O king, &s;aid I to him, rai&s;ing him up, you are of all the Mahometan princes, the mo&s;t firm to my &s;ect, and by con&s;equence, he that ought to be the mo&s;t acceptable to me. It was recorded in the Book of Fate, that your daughter &s;hould be de|ceived by a man; this your a&s;trologers very truly di&s;covered by their &s;ublime &s;cience, but I have prayed the mo&s;t High to exempt you from that mortal affliction, and to blot out this misfortune from the prede&s;tination of mankind. This he was plea&s;ed to do for my &s;ake, upon condition that Schirine &s;hould become one of my wives. To this I con|&s;ented, to recompen&s;e you for the good deeds you do every day.</P>
<P>King Bahaman was not in a condition of unde|ceiving him&s;elf. That weak prince believed all I had told him; and overjoyed at this alliance with the great prophet, he ca&s;t him&s;elf at my feet a &s;econd time, to &s;hew me the &s;en&s;e he had of my kindne&s;s. I rai&s;ed him up again, embraced him, and a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="74" REF="85">
him of my protection, while he could not find words to expre&s;s the gratitude of his mind.</P>
<P>The next morning the vi&s;iers and the courtiers returned to the prince&s;s's palace. They a&s;ked the king if he was informed of the truth of what he de|&s;ired to know. Yes, &s;aid he, I know now to what I am to tru&s;t. I have &s;een and &s;poken to the great prophet him&s;elf; he is to be my daughter's hu&s;band. Nothing is more true. Upon this the vi&s;iers and the courtiers, turning towards him that had oppo&s;ed the po&s;&s;ibility of this marriage, reproached him with incredulity; but they found him re&s;olute in his opinion: He maintained it with ob&s;tinacy, what|ever the king could &s;ay to per&s;uade him that Ma|homet was married to Schirine; till at la&s;t Bahaman became almo&s;t angry with this incredulous courtier, who was made the je&s;t of the council.</P>
<P>The heavens con&s;pired, as it were, to deceive the King. An accident that happened the &s;ame day, con|firmed the vi&s;iers in their opinion. As they were re|turning to the town with their ma&s;ter, a &s;torm &s;urpri&s;|ed them in the plain. The lightning fla&s;hed in their faces, and the thunder roared in &s;o terrible a manner, that they feared it was the la&s;t day. It happened that the incredulous courtier's hor&s;e took fright; he pranced, flung his ma&s;ter on the ground, and broke his leg with the fall. This event was looked upon as an effect of the wrath of heaven. O mi&s;erable wretch, cried the king, &s;eeing the courtier fall, this
<PB N="75" REF="86">
is the fruit of your ob&s;tinacy; you would not believe me, and the prophet has puni&s;hed you!</P>
<P>They carried the lame courtier home, and Baha|man was no &s;ooner returned to his palace, but he cau&s;ed it to be publi&s;hed at Gazna, that all the in|habitants &s;hould celebrate with fea&s;ting, the day appointed for the marriage of Schirine with Ma|homet. I took a walk in the town; and was in|formed of this news, as well as of the accident of the courtier's falling from his hor&s;e. It is not to be conceived how credulous and &s;uper&s;titious the people were; they made public rejoicings, and ran crying up and down, Long live Bahaman, the father-in-law of the great prophet!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was night, I got to the wood again, and was pre&s;ently with the prince&s;s. Charming Schirine, &s;aid I, going into her apartment, you know not what has happened to day on the plain. A courtier, who doubted that you were to be Maho|met's wife, has atoned for this doubt. I rai&s;ed a tempe&s;t that frightened his hor&s;e; the courtier fell, and broke his leg. I did not think fit to carry my revenge any farther; but I &s;wear by my tomb which is at Mecca, that if any one hereafter dares to doubt of your happine&s;s, it &s;hall co&s;t him his life. After having &s;taid &s;ome hours with Schirine, I re|tired.</P>
<P>The day following, the king a&s;&s;embled his vi&s;iers and courtiers. Let us go all together, &s;aid he to them, to a&s;k Mahomet's pardon for the unhappy man
<PB N="76" REF="87">
who refu&s;ed to believe me, and who has received the cha&s;ti&s;ement of his unbelief. At the &s;ame they mounted their hor&s;es, and went to the prince&s;s's palace. The king him&s;elf opened the doors, which he had locked and &s;ealed with his &s;ignet the day before. He went up, followed by his vi&s;iers, into his daughter's apartment. Schirine, &s;aid he, we are come to de&s;ire you to intercede with the prophet for a man who has incurred his wrath. I know very well what you mean, Sir, an&s;wered the prince&s;s; Mahomet has &s;poken to me of it. She then re|peated to them what I had told her over night, and informed them that I had &s;worn to de&s;troy all tho&s;e who doubted of her marriage with the prophet.</P>
<P>When the good king Bahaman heard this di&s;|cour&s;e, he turned him&s;elf towards his vi&s;iers and courtiers, and &s;aid to them. Had we not hitherto given credit to what we have &s;een, could we, after this, di&s;believe that Mahomet is my &s;on-in-law. You find that he him&s;elf told my daughter, that he had rai&s;ed the &s;torm to revenge him&s;elf of that faith|le&s;s man. All the mini&s;ters and others were con|vinced that &s;he was the prophet's wife; they ca&s;t them&s;elves before her; they humbly be&s;ought her to intercede with me in behalf of the wounded courtier; and &s;he promi&s;ed them &s;o to do.</P>
<P>During this time, I had con&s;umed all my provi&s;ions, and having no money left, the poor prophet Maho|met began not to know what to do. I bethought
<PB N="77" REF="88">
my&s;elf of an expedient. My prince&s;s, &s;aid I, one night to Schirine, we have forgot to ob&s;erve one formality concerning our wedding; you have brought me no portion, and that omi&s;&s;ion troubles me. Well; my dear &s;pou&s;e, an&s;wered &s;he, I will &s;peak of it to-morrow to my father, who, without doubt, will offer to you his trea&s;ures. No, no, replied I, there is no need of &s;peaking to him of it; I value not all his riches: they are of no u&s;e to me. It will be &s;ufficient to grant me &s;ome of your jewels; which is all the portion I a&s;k of you. Schirine would have loaded me with all her jewels, to make her portion the hand&s;omer; but I was contented with two great diamonds, which I &s;old the next day to a jeweller of Gazna. I put my&s;elf by this means in a condition to continue to per&s;onate Mahomet.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this, time, unluckily for me, an amba&s;&s;ador arrived at Gazna, on behalf of a neighbouring king, to demand Schirine in marriage. He had pre&s;ently audience, and when he had declared the &s;ubject of his emba&s;&s;y, Bahaman &s;aid to him, I am &s;orry I cannot give my daughter to the king your ma&s;ter, I have promi&s;ed her to the prophet Mahomet. The am|ba&s;&s;ador judged by this an&s;wer, that the king of Gazna was mad. He took leave of that prince, and returned to his ma&s;ter, who believed at fir&s;t, as well as he, that Bahaman had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es. At length, imputing this refu&s;al to contempt and &s;light, he be|came angry, flew to his army, and invaded the kingdom of Gazna.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="89">That king, who was named Cacem, was much &s;uperior in &s;trength to Bahaman; who moreover prepared &s;o &s;lowly to receive his enemy, that he could not hinder him from making a great progre&s;s. Cacem fought &s;ome troops that would have oppo&s;ed his pa&s;&s;age; he came forward with all &s;peed towards the town of Gazna, and found Bahaman's army in|trenched in the plain before the ca&s;tle of the prince&s;s Schirine. The de&s;ign of this provoked lover was to attack him in his intrenchments; but his troops having need of re&s;t, and he arriving not in the plain till towards night, put off the attack till the next morning.</P>
<P>In the mean while the king of Gazna, being in|formed of the number and valour of Cacem's troops, began to be afraid. He a&s;&s;embled his council, where the courtier, who was hurt in falling from his hor&s;e, &s;poke in the&s;e words: "I am amazed that the king &s;hould be in the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s on this occa&s;ion; what cau&s;e of di&s;may can the father-in-law of Ma|homet have, not only of Cacem, but of all the princes in the world put together? Your Maje&s;ty, Sir, has nothing to do but to apply your&s;elf to your &s;on-in-law; implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the great prophet; he will pre&s;ently confound your enemies. He can do no le&s;s, &s;ince he is the cau&s;e of Cacem's coming to trouble the repo&s;e of your &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>Though this was &s;poken in deri&s;ion, it in&s;pired Bahaman with confidence. You are in the right, &s;aid he to the courtier, 'tis to the prophet I ought to
<PB N="79" REF="90">
addre&s;s my&s;elf; I will pray him to drive away my haughty enemy, and I dare promi&s;e my&s;elf he will not reject my prayer. At the&s;e words he went to Schirine; daughter, &s;aid he, to-morrow morning, as &s;oon as day appears, Cacem de&s;igns to attack us; I fear he will force our intrenchments. I am come hither to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mahomet. Make u&s;e of all the intere&s;t you have with him, to engage him to defend us. Let us join in our interce&s;&s;ions to render him propitious to us. Sir, replied the prin|ce&s;s, it will not be very difficult to engage the prophet on our &s;ide. He will &s;hortly di&s;per&s;e the enemy's troops, and all the kings of the earth will learn, at Cacem's co&s;t, to re&s;pect you. However, replied the king, the night is come, and the prophet does not appear. He has for&s;aken us! No, no, my father, replied Schirine, think not he will abandon us in nece&s;&s;ity; he &s;ees from heaven the army that be&s;ieges us, and, perhaps, he is this moment going to &s;trike them with terror and di&s;may.</P>
<P>This was indeed what Mahomet had a great de&s;ire to do. I had all that day ob&s;erved the troops of Cacem afar off. I had regarded their di&s;po&s;ition, and above all had taken great notice of the king's quarters. I picked up great and little &s;tones; I filled my trunk with them, and in the middle of the night I rai&s;ed my&s;elf up in the air. I went towards Ca|cem's tents. I di&s;covered without trouble that where the king lay, it was a very high pavilion, finely gilt, made in the form of a cupola, and &s;upported by
<PB N="80" REF="91">
twelve pillars of painted wood, that were driven into the ground. The intervals of the pillars were filled up with boughs of &s;everal &s;orts of trees twi&s;ted to|gether. Towards the top there were two windows, one to the ea&s;t, and the other to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>All the &s;oldiers that were about the tent were a&s;leep, which gave me an opportunity to de&s;cend to one of the windows without being perceived. I &s;aw the king lying on a &s;ofa, with his head on a &s;attin cu&s;hion. I got a little out of my trunk, and throw|ing a great &s;tone at Cacem, I &s;truck him full in the forehead, and wounded him dangerou&s;ly. He gave a loud cry, which pre&s;ently waked his guards and his officers. They ran to that prince; they found him all over blood, and almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s. They called out, the quarters took the alarm, every one a&s;ked what was the matter. The report went that the king was wounded; but they could not tell by whom. While they were inquiring out the author, I rai&s;ed my&s;elf up almo&s;t to the clouds, and let fall a hail of &s;tones upon and about the royal tent. Some &s;oldiers were wounded, and cried out, that it rained &s;tones. This news &s;pread it&s;elf abroad, and to confirm it, I flung &s;tones all about. Then a panic fear &s;ei&s;ed the whole army; the officers, as well as &s;oldiers, believed the prophet was angry with Cacem, and that he declared his wrath by this prodigy. At la&s;t the enemies of Bahaman were &s;truck with di&s;may, and fled with &s;uch precipitation, that they left their equipage and tents
<PB N="81" REF="92">
behind them, crying, we are undone, Mahomet will de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>The king of Gazna was very much &s;urpri&s;ed at day-break, when, in&s;tead of &s;eeing him&s;elf attacked, he perceived that the enemy was making off. He pre&s;ently pur&s;ued them with his be&s;t &s;oldiers. He made a great &s;laughter of the fugitives, and overtook Cacem, who&s;e wound hindered him from making &s;peed. Why, &s;aid he to him, did you come into my dominions again&s;t all right and rea&s;on? What cau&s;e had I given you to make war again&s;t me? Baha|man, an&s;wered the vanqui&s;hed king, I thought you had refu&s;ed me your daughter in contempt and di&s;|dain, and I was re&s;olved to revenge my&s;elf on you. I could not believe that the prophet Mahomet was your &s;on-in-law; but I doubt it not now, &s;ince it is he that has wounded me, and di&s;per&s;ed my army.</P>
<P>Bahaman cea&s;ed to pur&s;ue his enemies, and re|turned to Gazna with Cacem, who died that day of his wound. They divided a booty which was &s;o con|&s;iderable, that the &s;oldiers returned home loaded with riches. Prayers were made in all the mo&s;ques, to return thanks to heaven for having confounded the enemies of the kingdom; and when it was night, the king went without any attendants to the prin|ce&s;s's palace. Daughter, &s;aid he to her, I am come to return thanks to the prophet; you have been in|formed, by the courier I &s;ent you, of what Mahomet has done for us; I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his goodne&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="93">
to us, that I die with impatience to embrace his knees.</P>
<P>He &s;oon had the &s;atisfaction he de&s;ired. I entered by the u&s;ual window into Schirine's apartment, where I expected to find him. He flung him&s;elf at my feet, and ki&s;&s;ed the ground, &s;aying, O great prophet, no words can expre&s;s the gratitude I feel. Read in my heart my acknowledgments. I rai&s;ed Bahaman up, and ki&s;&s;ed his forehead. Prince, &s;aid I, could you think I would refu&s;e you my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ill circum&s;tances you were reduced to for my &s;ake? I have puni&s;hed the proud Cacem, who de&s;igned to have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of your dominions, and to have taken away Schirine to place her among the &s;laves in his &s;eraglio. Fear not from henceforth, that any potentate in the world will dare to make war again&s;t you. If any one &s;hould have the boldne&s;s to come and attack you, I will pour on his troops a rain of fire, that &s;hall reduce them all to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>After having a&s;&s;ured the king of Gazna afre&s;h that I would take his kingdom under my protection, I told him how the enemy's army was frightened when it rained &s;tones on their camp. Bahaman, on his part, repeated to me what Cacem had told him, and retired. That prince&s;s, who was not le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than the king her father of the important &s;ervice I had done the &s;tate, declared to me her acknowledg|ments in &s;o tender a manner, that I had very nearly forgot the time: for the day appeared as I
<PB N="83" REF="94">
got to my trunk; but I pa&s;&s;ed &s;o well then for Mahomet in every body's opinion, that if the &s;ol|diers had &s;een me in the air, they would not have been undeceived. I could hardly forbear think|ing my&s;elf to be the prophet, after having routed an army.</P>
<P>Two days after, when they had interred Cacem, to whom, though an enemy, they gave a magnifi|cent burial, the king ordered public rejoicings to be made in the city, as well for the defeat of the ene|my's troops, as to celebrate &s;olemnly the marriage of the prince&s;s Schirine with Mahomet. The mor|row was the day I had appointed upon which I thought I could do no le&s;s than &s;ignalize, by &s;ome prodigy, a fe&s;tival that was ob&s;erved in honour of me. To this end I bought in Gazna &s;ome white pitch, and cotton-&s;eed, together with a little &s;teel to &s;trike fire with. I &s;pent the day in the wood to prepare my fire-works. I &s;teeped the cotton-&s;eed in the pitch; and at night, when the people were rejoicing in the &s;treets, tran&s;ported my&s;elf above the town; I rai&s;ed my&s;elf as high as was po&s;&s;ible, for fear they &s;hould di&s;cern my machine by the brighthe&s;s of my artificial flame; then &s;truck fire, and lighted the pitch, which, with the cotton-&s;eed, produced a wonderful effect. This done, I retired into my wood. The day ap|pearing a little afterwards, I went into the town, to have the plea&s;ure of hearing what they &s;aid of me. Was not deceived in my expectation; the people talked extravagantly of the trick I had played them;
<PB N="84" REF="95">
&s;ome &s;aid it was Mahomet, who, to &s;hew that their fe&s;tival was agreeable to him, had made cele&s;tial fires appear; and others affirmed, that they &s;aw the pro|phet in the middle of tho&s;e new meteors, with a long white beard, and a venerable air, as they fancied.</P>
<P>All this di&s;cour&s;e was exceedingly diverting to me; but, alas! while I was taking this plea&s;ure, my trunk, my dear trunk, the in&s;trument of all my wonders, was burnt in the wood. In all appear|ance, &s;ome &s;park, that I did not perceive, took hold of my machine in my ab&s;ence, and con&s;umed it. When I returned, I found it reduced to a&s;hes. A father, who, returning home, &s;hould &s;ee his only &s;on pierced in a thou&s;and places, and weltering in his blood, could not be more &s;hocked than I was. The wood echoed again with my cries and groans. I tore my hair, and rent my cloaths. I know not how I &s;pared my own life in the rage of my de&s;peration.</P>
<P>Thus ended my adventure with the prince&s;s Schirine, at the very time when I had nearly accom|pli&s;hed my plot; and which, though I was then in de&s;pair, I have &s;ince been happy to reflect that it did not proceed any further.</P>

<P>The foregoing &s;tory, my children, however ex|travagant and fabulous, is no bad &s;atire upon Cre|dulity; and may teach us, that though fear and &s;u&s;|picion are di&s;graceful, yet a proper degree of doubt
<PB N="85" REF="96">
and circum&s;pection are nece&s;&s;ary, as the following little anecdote may &s;erve to confirm. One Sunday, in the afternoon, as two ladies were knocking at a door, a very genteel looking man came up to the hou&s;e, bowed, and followed them in. After &s;ome conver&s;ation, the gentleman began to wonder that his aunt did not return from church, and to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ermon mu&s;t be longer than ordinary. Pre&s;ently afterwards, however, the lady was heard at the door, and the gentleman in&s;tantly, with great glee, propo&s;ed a &s;cheme to frighten the old lady, his relation: I will &s;lip, &s;aid he, into the next room with the &s;ilver tea-kettle and lamp, &s;o that as &s;oon as &s;he calls for them, to make tea, &s;he may conclude they are &s;tolen. This was no &s;ooner &s;aid than done, and our dextrous hero, covering his prize with his hat, and hiding him&s;elf till the old lady was pa&s;t, bade the maid let him out, and told her he &s;hould be back pre&s;ently. Compliments being pa&s;t, the bell was rung, and tea ordered: this &s;et the vi&s;itors a tittering, and the old lady a won|dering, but &s;he pre&s;ently found out the cau&s;e; the maid could find neither kettle nor lamp, and the ladies in the parlour were &s;o full of the joke, that they bur&s;t out into a loud laugh. As &s;oon as their mirth would permit, the matter was explained, the old lady's nephew mentioned, and the plot unra|velled: but the cata&s;trophe was not happy; for the tea-kettle and the nephew, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, never made their appearance in that hou&s;e again.

<HEAD>INCREDULITY: Or the Story of CHEC CHAHABEDDIN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sultan of Egypt having &s;ummoned all the learned men of his kingdom to meet on a certain day in his palace, there aro&s;e a di&s;pute among them. It is &s;aid that the angel Gabriel, having one night taken Mahomet out of his bed, &s;hewed him what|ever is in the &s;even heavens, in paradi&s;e and in hell; and that the &s;ame great prophet, after having had four&s;core and ten thou&s;and conferences with the Deity, was brought back again into his bed by the &s;ame angel. Some of the doctors have advanced, that all this was done in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time, that Mahomet at his return found his bed &s;till warm; and that he took up a pot of water, which was not yet run out, though the pot had been thrown down the very moment that the angel Gabriel carried Mahomet out of his chamber.</P>
<P>The Sultan, who pre&s;ided in this a&s;&s;embly, main|tained that this was impo&s;&s;ible: You teach, &s;ays he, that there are &s;even heavens; between each of which
<PB N="87" REF="98">
there is a di&s;tance no le&s;s than a man can well tra|vel in five hundred years; and that each heaven is as thick as it is di&s;tant from the next to it: how then is it po&s;&s;ible, that Mahomet, after having pa&s;&s;|ed through all the&s;e heavens, and after having had four&s;core and ten thou&s;and conferences, &s;hould at his return find his bed &s;till warm; and the pot thrown down, with the water not &s;pilt? Who can be cre|dulous enough to believe &s;o ridiculous a fable? Know you not that if a pot full of water is thrown down, you will find no water in it? The literati an|&s;wered, that this indeed could not <HI>naturally</HI> be; but all things were po&s;&s;ible to the Divine Power. The Sultan of Egypt, who was ob&s;tinate, and had made it a maxim never to believe any thing contrary to rea&s;on, gave no credit to the miracle; and the learn|ed broke up their a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute made a great noi&s;e in Egypt; and the news of it came to the ears of Chec Chaha|beddin, who, for rea&s;ons not a&s;&s;igned in the hi&s;tory, could not be pre&s;ent at the a&s;&s;embly: however, he went to the Sultan's palace in the heat of the day. The Sultan, informed of the Doctor's being come, carried him into a &s;tate chamber, and &s;poke to him in this manner: You need not have given your&s;elf the trouble of coming hither; it had been enough to have &s;ent one of your &s;ervants; for we &s;hould have granted him any thing in your name: Sir, an|&s;wered the Doctor, I am come in hopes of having a moment's conver&s;ation with your maje&s;ty. The
<PB N="88" REF="99">
Sultan, who knew that this Chec was noted for be|having <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The contemplative cabali&s;tical Doctors of the Ea&s;t are &s;o proud, that they claim re&s;pect from their Kings.</NOTE> haughtily in the pre&s;ence of Princes, &s;hewed him great civilities, and made abundance of com|pliments.</P>
<P>The room they were in had four windows, on each &s;ide one: the Doctor de&s;ired the King to or|der one of them to be &s;hut. This being done, they continued for &s;ome time in conver&s;ation; after which the Doctor de&s;ired that one of the windows, which had the pro&s;pect of a mountain called Kzeldaghi, or the Red Mountain, might be opened, and then bid the King look out. The Sultan put his head to the window, and &s;aw on the mountain and in the plain a body of hor&s;e, more in number than the &s;tars of heaven, armed with bucklers and coats of mail, with their &s;words drawn, advancing full &s;peed towards the palace. The Prince changed colour, and in great di&s;may cried out, Heaven! what dread|ful army is this, coming to attack my palace? Be not afraid, Sir, &s;ays the Doctor, there's nothing in it. Saying this he &s;hut the window, and opening it again the next moment, the King looked out, but &s;aw not a &s;ingle per&s;on on the mountain, or in the plain.</P>
<P>Another of the windows gave a pro&s;pect of the city, and the Doctor opened that. The Sultan &s;aw the city of Cairo on fire, and the flames a&s;cending
<PB N="89" REF="100">
even to the middle region of the air. What dread|ful burning is that? exclaimed the King. See my city, my fine city of Cairo, reduced to a&s;hes! Fear not, Sir, &s;aid the Chec, there is nothing in it. At the &s;ame time he &s;hut the window, and opened it again, when the King &s;aw no more of the flames.</P>
<P>The Doctor opened the third window; out of which the Sultan perceived the Nile overflowing its banks, and its waves rolling with fury to drown his palace. The King, notwith&s;tanding what he had experienced, was terrified at this new prodigy. Alas! cried he, all is lo&s;t; we are now undone indeed. This dreadful inundation will bear away my palace, and drown me and my people! Fear not, Sir, &s;aid the Doctor, there's nothing in it. The Chec had no &s;ooner &s;hut and opened the win|dow again, than the Nile appeared pur&s;uing its cour&s;e as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>He then opened the fourth window: the other wonders had not more terrified than this delighted the King. His eyes, that were accu&s;tomed to &s;ee nothing at this window but a barren wa&s;te, were agreeably &s;urprized to behold vineyards and gardens, hung with the mo&s;t delicious fruits; rivulets mur|muring as they glided; who&s;e banks were adorned with ro&s;es, narci&s;&s;us' and hyacinths, at once plea&s;|ing to the &s;ight, and fragrant to the &s;mell; an in|finite number of turtles and nightingales, &s;training their little throats with their &s;weet and mournful &s;ongs. The King, charmed with the wonders
<PB N="90" REF="101">
which now offered them&s;elves to his &s;ight, believed he beheld the garden of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of the Terre&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial Paradi&s;e, according to the Turks.</NOTE> Eram. What a change is this! cried he, in the exce&s;s of his admiration: O beautiful garden! charming abode!&mdash;Be not &s;o tran&s;ported, &s;aid the Chec, there is nothing in it. The Doctor &s;hut the window, then opened it again; and the Sultan, in&s;tead of the&s;e delightful phantoms, &s;aw nothing but the de&s;art.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the Chec, I have &s;hewn you many won|ders, but all this is nothing in compari&s;on of the a&s;toni&s;hing prodigy, of which I will make your ma|je&s;ty a witne&s;s. Give your commands for a tub full of water to be brought hither.&mdash;The King ordered it to be done. The tub was brought into the cham|ber. Be plea&s;ed, &s;aid the Doctor, to &s;uffer your|&s;elf to be &s;tripped, and let a towel be girt about your loins. The King con&s;ented to have his cloaths taken off; and when the towel was girt about him, Sir, &s;aid the Chec, plunge your head into the wa|ter, and draw it out again.</P>
<P>The King plunged, and in an in&s;tant found him|&s;elf at the foot of a mountain on the &s;ea-&s;hore. This prodigy a&s;toni&s;hed him more than the others: Ah Doctor, cried he, in a tran&s;port of rage, perfi|dious Doctor, that ha&s;t thus cruelly deceived me! If ever I return into Egypt, from whence thou ha&s;t forced me by thy black and dete&s;table art, I &s;wear I will revenge my&s;elf of thee. O maye&s;t thou mi|&s;erably
<PB N="91" REF="102">
peri&s;h! He continued his imprecations again&s;t the Chec; but, reflecting that his menaces and com|plaints would nothing avail him, he took courage, and went to &s;ome men whom he &s;aw cutting wood on the mountain, re&s;olved not to di&s;cover to them who he was. For, thought he, if I tell them I am a King, they will not believe me; they will take me for an impo&s;tor or a madman.</P>
<P>The wood-cutters a&s;ked him who he was: Good people, an&s;wered he, I am a merchant. My &s;hip bulged on a rock, and was da&s;hed to pieces. I have had the good fortune to &s;ave my&s;elf on a plank. You &s;ee the condition I am in, which ought to excite your pity. They were concerned for his misfor|tune, but the poverty of their circum&s;tances would not allow them to grant him any relief. However, one of them gave him an old gown, and another an old pair of &s;hoes; and when they had put him in this condition, they conducted him into their city, that was &s;ituate behind the mountain; where they no &s;ooner arrived, than they took leave of him, and, abandoning him to Providence, went away, each to his own home.</P>
<P>The Sultan was left alone; and though men take delight in new objects, he was too much taken up with the thoughts of his adventure, to give attention to any thing he &s;aw: he walked up and down the &s;treets. He was weary, and, looking for a place to lie down and re&s;t him&s;elf, &s;topped before the hou&s;e of an old farrier, who, judging by his looks that he
<PB N="92" REF="103">
was fatigued, de&s;ired him to come in. The King did &s;o, and &s;ate him&s;elf down on a bench that was near the door. Young man, &s;aid the old farrier, may I a&s;k you what profe&s;&s;ion you follow, and what has brought you hither. The Sultan gave him the &s;ame an&s;wer he had given to the wood-cutters: I met, added he, with &s;ome good people, who were cutting wood on the mountain; and having told them my misfortune, they were &s;o kind as to give me this old gown, and the&s;e cobbled &s;hoes. I am glad, &s;aid the farrier, that you e&s;caped being drown|ed: comfort your&s;elf for the lo&s;s of your goods: you are young, and will not perhaps be unhappy in this city, where our laws and cu&s;toms are very favour|able to &s;trangers, that come to &s;ettle among us. Do not you intend to do &s;o? I de&s;ire nothing bet|ter, an&s;wered the Sultan, provided I could have any pro&s;pect of retrieving my affairs. Well then, re|plied the old man, follow the advice I am about to give you. Go this moment to the public baths of the women: &s;et your&s;elf down at the gate, and a&s;k each lady that comes out, if &s;he has a hu&s;band: &s;he that &s;hall an&s;wer you, No, mu&s;t be your wife according to the cu&s;tom of this country.</P>
<P>The Sultan, being determined to follow this ad|vice, went to the gate of the baths. It was not long ere he &s;aw a lady of exqui&s;ite beauty. Ah! how happy &s;hould I be, thought he to him&s;elf, if this lovely per&s;on be not married! were &s;he but mine, I could forget my misfortunes. He &s;topped
<PB N="93" REF="104">
her and &s;aid, Fair lady, have you a hu&s;band? She an&s;wered, Yes. I am &s;orry for it, replied the King: you would have made a fit wife for me. The lady went her way, and &s;oon after came another, fright|fully ugly: the Sultan &s;huddered at &s;ight of her: What a piece of deformity is this! &s;aid he: I had rather be &s;tarved to death, than live with &s;uch a crea|ture: I will let her pa&s;s. The old farrier, however, bid me a&s;k the que&s;tion of every lady. In all ap|pearance the cu&s;tom is &s;o, and I mu&s;t &s;ubmit: how do I know but &s;he has a hu&s;band: &s;ome unfortunate &s;tranger, who&s;e ill de&s;tiny has brought him hither, as mine has me, may perhaps have married her. In &s;hort, the King re&s;olved to a&s;k the que&s;tion. She an&s;wered, Yes.</P>
<P>Next came out a third, as ugly as the other. O heavens! &s;aid the King, this is more horrible than the la&s;t: no matter; &s;ince I have begun, I mu&s;t go through with it. If this have a hu&s;band, I mu&s;t own there are men more to be pitied than my&s;elf. As &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing him, he addre&s;&s;ed her, and trem|bling, &s;aid, Fair lady, are you married? Yes, young man, an&s;wered &s;he, without &s;topping. I am glad of it, replied the Sultan. I ble&s;s my &s;tars, conti|nued he, that I am free of the&s;e two women. But it is not yet time to rejoice: all the ladies are not come out of the baths; nor have I yet &s;een her that is de&s;tined for me. Perhaps I &s;hall get nothing by the change.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="105">A fourth appeared, who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in beauty the fir&s;t, that he thought &s;o charming: What differ|ence, cried he; there is not &s;o much di&s;parity be|tween day and night, as between this fine woman and the two la&s;t! Are angels and devils to be &s;een in the &s;ame place? He advanced to her with eager|ne&s;s. Lady, &s;aid he, have you a hu&s;band? She an|&s;wered, No; looking on him with as much di&s;dain as attention; then went away, leaving him in deep &s;urprize. What am I to think of this, &s;ays he: the old farrier has certainly jeered me. If, accord|ing to the laws of this country, I am to marry this lady, why did &s;he leave me &s;o rudely? Why put &s;he on that haughty and di&s;dainful air? She viewed me from head to foot; and I &s;aw in her looks the marks of contempt and &s;corn. The truth is, &s;he is not much in the wrong. In ju&s;tice I cannot blame her. This threadbare gown, full of holes, is not over proper to engage a lady's heart. I forgive her for thinking &s;he may chance to mend her&s;elf.</P>
<P>While thus reflecting, a &s;lave acco&s;ted him: Sir, &s;aid he, I am &s;ent to find a &s;tranger in tatters; and, by your air, methinks it &s;hould be you. If you plea&s;e to give your&s;elf the trouble of following me, I will lead you to a place, where you are expected with great impatience. The Sultan followed the &s;lave, who led him to a great hou&s;e, and &s;hewed him into an apartment elegantly furni&s;hed. He bid him wait. The Sultan &s;taid full two hours without &s;ee|ing
<PB N="95" REF="106">
a &s;oul but the &s;lave, who every now and then came and de&s;ired him not to be impatient.</P>
<P>At length came in four ladies, who accompanied another, glittering in jewels, but yet more re&s;plen|dent in beauty. The Sultan ca&s;t his eyes upon her, and recollected her to be the la&s;t lady that he had &s;een coming out of the bath. She drew near him: Forgive me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that I have made you wait. I was loth to appear in my undre&s;s be|fore my lord and ma&s;ter. You are in your own hou&s;e, all you &s;ee here belongs to you: you are my hu&s;band: command me what you plea&s;e, I am ready to obey. Madam, an&s;wered the Sultan, not a mo|ment ago I complained of my de&s;tiny, but now I am the mo&s;t happy of men. But &s;ince I am your hu&s;band, why did you ju&s;t now look &s;o di&s;dainfully upon me? You were &s;hocked, perhaps, at the &s;ight of me; and, to confe&s;s the truth, I could not much blame you. Sir, replied the lady, I could not do other|wi&s;e; the women of this city are obliged to carry them&s;elves haughtily in public: it is the cu&s;tom. Well, &s;aid the King, &s;ince I am ma&s;ter here, in or|der to exerci&s;e my little &s;overeignty, let &s;omebody bring me a taylor and a &s;hoemaker: I am a&s;hamed to be &s;een in your pre&s;ence in this tattered gown, and the&s;e cobbled &s;hoes, which ill &s;uit with the rank I have hitherto held in the world. I have taken care of that already, replied the lady: I have &s;ent a &s;lave to a Jew, who &s;ells cloaths ready made, and who will furni&s;h you at once with all you want:
<PB N="96" REF="107">
mean while let us take &s;ome refre&s;hment. In &s;ay|ing this, &s;he led him to a table covered with all &s;orts of fruits and &s;weat-meats. While they were eat|ing, the four attendant ladies, who &s;tood behind, &s;ung &s;ongs, and played on &s;everal in&s;truments; their mi&s;tre&s;s took a lute, and accompanying the mu&s;ic with her voice, charmed the Sultan.</P>
<P>The concert was interrupted by the Jew trade&s;|man, with bundles of cloaths of different &s;orts. They made choice of a white &s;attin ve&s;t, flowered with gold, and a gown of purple. The lady admired the King; was very well &s;atisfied to have found &s;uch a hu&s;band; and he well plea&s;ed to have met with &s;o beautiful a wife.</P>
<P>He had lived &s;even years with this lady, by whom he had &s;everal &s;ons and daughters. But both of them taking delight in expen&s;ive life, they outrun the lady's e&s;tate, were obliged to put away their waiting ladies and &s;laves, and to &s;ell their furniture for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The Sultan's wife, &s;eeing her&s;elf reduced to want, told her hu&s;band; "As long as my e&s;tate la&s;ted, you never &s;pared it: it behoves you now to think of &s;ome way or other to maintain your little family."</P>
<P>The&s;e words &s;truck the King, who went to the old farrier to a&s;k his advice. O my father, &s;ays he, I am now in a wor&s;e condition, than when I came fir&s;t to this city: I have a wife and children, and nothing for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Young man, replied the aged farrier, were you not brought up to trade?
<PB N="97" REF="108">
The Sultan an&s;wered, No. The farrier put his hand in his pocket, and giving him two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aqtcha</HI> is a coin of the value of a penny.</NOTE> <HI>Aqtchas,</HI> bid him immediately buy him&s;elf &s;ome <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ypes</HI> are cords that porters u&s;e in&s;tead of a knot.</NOTE> <HI>Ypes,</HI> and wait in the place where the porters plied. The Sultan bought them, and went to ply among the porters.</P>
<P>Scarce was he arrived, when a man a&s;ked him if he would carry a burthen? I am here for that pur|po&s;e, an&s;wered the Sultan. The man loaded him with a great &s;ack, which the King had much ado to carry, and the cords wrung the &s;kin off his &s;houl|ders. He received his pay of one <HI>Aqtcha,</HI> and car|ried it home. His wife, &s;eeing no more money, told him, that if he earned not ten times as much every day, his family mu&s;t &s;tarve.</P>
<P>The next morning, overwhelmed with grief, in|&s;tead of plying among the porters, he walked to the &s;ea-&s;ide, reflecting on his mi&s;erable condition. There he looked very earne&s;tly on the place, and, re|calling to mind his &s;trange and fatal adventure, he &s;unk into tears. The ceremony of <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Mahometans wa&s;h their bodies before they &s;ay their prayers.</NOTE> <HI>Ablution</HI> being indi&s;pen&s;ible before prayers, he plunged him&s;elf into the &s;ea; and rai&s;ing his head out of the water, (what a&s;toni&s;hment!) he found him&s;elf again in his own palace, in the middle of the tub, and &s;urrounded by all his officers. O barbarous Doctor, cried he,
<PB N="98" REF="109">
perceiving the Chec upon the very &s;pot on which he had left him, do&s;t thou not dread that God will pu|ni&s;h thee, for having played this trick with thy Sul|tan and thy ma&s;ter? Sir, &s;aid the Chec, why is your maje&s;ty angry with me? You but this moment plunged your head into this water. I tell you no|thing but the truth: if you do not believe me, a&s;k your officers, who were eye-witne&s;&s;es of it. The Sultan gave no credit to them. It is full &s;even years, &s;aid he, that this cur&s;ed Doctor has detained me in a foreign country by the force of his enchantments; I married, and had children; but it is not of this I complain &s;o much, as of my being a porter. Oh villainous Chec! could&s;t thou be &s;o cruel as to make me carry <HI>Ypes:</HI> Sir, replied the Doctor, when you came into this apartment, did not you leave the beautiful Sultane&s;s, Zeineb, in the pangs of child-birth? Yes, &s;aid the Sultan. Lo! &s;aid Chahabed|din, here comes an officer to &s;alute thee a father, but to inform thee likewi&s;e that the Prophet has pu|ni&s;hed thy infidelity, Zeinib is dead. As the Chec fini&s;hed this &s;entence, the room &s;hook with thun|der, the learned Chahabeddin di&s;appeared, and left the Sultan to lament his charming Zeneib, and his want of faith.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE XIV.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE &s;ubject which I have &s;elected for this day's reading is of &s;o much importance to your pre&s;ent and future conduct, that I mu&s;t intreat you all to li&s;ten with more than ordinary attention.</P>
<P>Truth is the fir&s;t duty of man, the greate&s;t of moral virtues, and the &s;tronge&s;t bond of &s;ocial af|fection. Whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es truth mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be virtuous; for he will po&s;&s;e&s;s that permanent and un|&s;haken veracity which will not admit the lea&s;t equi|vocation, or mental re&s;ervation, that &s;teady &s;incerity which will rather &s;ubmit to the &s;hame of an indi&s;creet, or even the puni&s;hment of a wrong action, than the greate&s;t of all di&s;grace, the meane&s;t of all vices, <HI>lying.</HI> It is ea&s;y to conceive that a man who re&s;o|lutely per&s;i&s;ts in being &s;incere in telling the exact truth, and the whole truth, though, by &s;uch con|duct, he mu&s;t at &s;ome times publi&s;h his own weak|ne&s;s, will become exceedingly circum&s;pect and watch|ful over him&s;elf. Shame is a very powerful and &s;evere &s;en&s;ation, and few would be hardy enough to venture on a wrong action with a certainty of its becoming public. A determined adherence to truth will, therefore, prevent both vice and folly, and whoever can teach &s;incerity, will, at the &s;ame time, teach many other virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="111"><HI>Strong minds</HI> alone are capable of that inflexible veracity of which I &s;peak; and wherever this is found, we need not he&s;itate to pronounce the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or to be among the fir&s;t of men. Ob&s;erve there|fore, children, who&s;oever of you gives me the mo&s;t repeated proofs of plain, full, and unequivocal &s;ince|rity, will, at the &s;ame time, give me the mo&s;t un|doubted a&s;&s;urance of &s;uperior capacity, and become mo&s;t honoured, mo&s;t re&s;pected, and mo&s;t beloved.</P>
<P>The fidelity and truth of the philo&s;opher Xeno|crates were &s;uch, that the Athenians, when he gave evidence, would not &s;uffer him to be &s;worn; his word alone was &s;ufficient. This, my children, is true, &s;ub&s;tantial, and everla&s;ting fame.</P>
<P>When the Duke of O&s;&s;ura was at Barcelona, he went on board one of the gallies, and having the privilege of relea&s;ing any of the pri&s;oners which had been &s;ent there for crimes and mi&s;demeanors, he began to que&s;tion them, in order to di&s;cover who mo&s;t de&s;erved his pity. All were anxious to excu&s;e them&s;elves, by attributing their puni&s;hment to the malice of their enemies, or the inju&s;tice of the ma|gi&s;trates, excepting one man, who, when the Duke a&s;ked what was the rea&s;on of his being there, re|plied, "I was &s;ent here, Sir, very de&s;ervedly; I committed a robbery upon the highway near Sara|go&s;&s;a. It is true I was not only &s;tarving my&s;elf, but had a wife and family in the &s;ame condition. How|ever, I was guilty of the fact, and de&s;erve my pu|ni&s;hment." "Why, hey-day! &s;aid the Duke;
<PB N="101" REF="112">
here's an impudent fellow indeed! How dare you intrude into the &s;ociety of &s;uch hone&s;t worthy men? Here, knock off this fellow's irons. Get away, you ra&s;cal; and, do you hear, never more let me find you in &s;uch innocent company." "No, God ble&s;s your Grace," &s;aid the poor fellow; "that I will be an&s;werable you never &s;hall."</P>
<P>I quote the&s;e particulars to exemplify this great point, videlicet, that truth is not only virtuous but politic. The Orientals had a law, that whoever was three times convicted of &s;peaking fal&s;ely, was condemned, under pain of death, never to &s;peak again; but continue in &s;ilence and reproach during life: &s;o utterly did they dete&s;t fal&s;ehood, and &s;o con|vinced were they of its pernicious con&s;equences. And believe me, my children, though lyars are per|mitted the u&s;e of their tongues, their puni&s;hment is little inferior among us; for whoever is three times detected in lying by any per&s;on of veracity, will never be credited by that per&s;on again. Li&s;ten, children, to the &s;tory of Saddyq, and learn wi&s;dom.</P>

<HEAD>TRUTH: Or the Story of SADDYQ.</HEAD>
<P>TOGALTIMUR-CAN, King of Tartary, was one day told that there was, in his dominions, a man who was &s;o great an enemy to lying that he always told truth. The King had a mind to have
<PB N="102" REF="113">
him near his per&s;on, and made him Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e. A courtier of &s;o extraordinary a character &s;oon found enemies, who watched all opportunities to ruin him: but the King, who was not ea&s;ily to be impo&s;ed on, and who tru&s;ted to his own judge|ment, made trial of his Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e on &s;e|veral occa&s;ions, and having always found him frank and &s;incere, gave him the &s;urname of Saddyq, or <HI>the Teller of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Of all Saddyq's enemies, the Vi&s;ier Tangribirdi was the mo&s;t inveterately bent on his ruin. He em|ployed all &s;orts of &s;tratagems to di&s;grace him in the mind of Togaltimur: but not being able to compa&s;s his de&s;ign, he di&s;clo&s;ed one day to his daughter Ho&s;|chendan the unea&s;ine&s;s it gave him to be &s;till di&s;ap|pointed. How unfortunate am I! &s;aid he to her: I have been the cau&s;e of the di&s;grace of a thou&s;and old courtiers; yet I cannot de&s;troy this man, who, though but newly &s;ettled at court, triumphs over all my efforts to ruin his fortune. Ho&s;chendan, who equalled her father in malice, in&s;tead of exhorting him no longer to oppo&s;e the good fortune of Saddyq, &s;aid to him, My dear father, cea&s;e to afflict your|&s;elf: if you are ab&s;olutely determined to bring Saddyq into the King's disfavour, leave the care of it to my management. Ah! replied the vi&s;ier, what method will you take to compa&s;s it? A&s;k me not that, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, give me leave only to go to the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and I promi&s;e you I will bring him to a nece&s;&s;ity of telling a lie to the King. Do whatever
<PB N="103" REF="114">
you will, daughter, &s;aid the vi&s;ier, I give you free leave. Provided you prove as good as your word, no matter what it co&s;ts.</P>
<P>Ho&s;chendan was wholly intent to prepare her&s;elf for the execution of the project &s;he had formed. She cloathed her&s;elf in her riche&s;t apparel, and adorned her&s;elf with all her jewels. In &s;hort, after having added to her natural beauty all the advantages that art could give, &s;he went from her father's one night, attended by &s;ome &s;laves, who convoyed her &s;afely to Saddyq's hou&s;e. When &s;he was arrived, &s;he &s;ent back her &s;laves, knocked at the door, and told the &s;ervant that &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with Saddyq about an affair of very great importance. They conducted her into his apartment. She found him &s;itting on a &s;opha, approached him, threw off the veil that co|vered her face, and &s;at down on the &s;ame &s;opha, without &s;aying one &s;ingle word.</P>
<P>Saddyq who had never &s;een, not even in a dream, &s;o beautiful a per&s;on, was &s;truck to the heart, and became motionle&s;s. The lady, who&s;e de&s;ign was to in&s;pire him with love, &s;pared not the means to ac|compli&s;h it. She care&s;&s;ed him with a thou&s;and dalliances; and &s;aid, O Saddyq, be not &s;urpri&s;ed that a woman who loves you, thus &s;eeks for you in pri|vate. Grant me a &s;ingle favour.&mdash;Soul of my &s;oul! cried out the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, you need only name it. What can I refu&s;e to the&s;e powerful charms, of which I am &s;o enamoured? Command your &s;lave&mdash;tell him what you wi&s;h. I have a mind,
<PB N="104" REF="115">
replied Ho&s;chendan, with a longing de&s;ire to eat &s;ome hor&s;e-fle&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hor&s;e-fle&s;h is a great dainty among the Tartars; &s;o likewi&s;e is the milk of mares.</NOTE>. Kill me immediately the fatte&s;t of all the King's hor&s;es: take out the heart and the liver, get them roa&s;ted, and let us eat them together. Charming lady, an&s;wered Saddyq, rather a&s;k me my life: I have a re&s;pect for every thing that belongs to the King my ma&s;ter. Let us put off this frolick till to-morrow: I will then buy a hor&s;e as fat as a bacon-hog, and we will regale our&s;elves like Princes. No, no, replied Ho&s;chendan, I mu&s;t eat of one of the King's hor&s;es: it is a fancy I have taken, and you mu&s;t gratify it. I cannot comply with your reque&s;t, &s;aid Saddyq: I love the King my ma&s;ter too well to give him the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. Should I prove &s;o weak as to yield to your reque&s;t, I am certain he would not fail to puni&s;h me. You need not fear that, &s;aid Ho&s;chendan; &s;hould the King a&s;k you what was become of the hor&s;e, &s;ay, that having found him &s;ick, and pa&s;t all hope of recovery, you thought it be&s;t to kill him, le&s;t he &s;hould have in|fected the other hor&s;es with his di&s;ea&s;e. The King, who by way of excellence has given you the &s;urname of Saddyq, will take your word for it, and even com|mend your precaution.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e began to waver&mdash;What &s;hall I do? &s;aid he to him&s;elf. On the one hand, my re&s;pect for the King, and the fear of puni&s;hment, keep me in awe: on the other, the charms of this
<PB N="105" REF="116">
heavenly face allure me. Ho&s;chendan, perceiving the perplexity he was in, renewed her attacks &s;o forcibly that he conde&s;cended at length to her re|que&s;t. They went together to the King's &s;tables. O my Prince! &s;aid Ho&s;chendan to Saddyq, &s;ince you grant me the favour, grant it to my wi&s;h; pray cut the throat of this black hor&s;e, which &s;tands here apart from the re&s;t. O my Queen! my Sultane&s;s! cried the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, you know not what you a&s;k. You put my love to too &s;evere a trial. This black hor&s;e is of all others that which the King loves be&s;t. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to com|ply with your de&s;ire. Pitch upon any one of the re&s;t, and his throat &s;hall be cut in&s;tantly. This is all that I can do for you; and, indeed, all that you ought to expect. But the lady was not to be re|fu&s;ed: on the contrary, throwing her&s;elf at his feet, O my Prince! &s;aid &s;he, my dear Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, I conjure you not to refu&s;e my &s;uit. I know well that the proof of tenderne&s;s, which I a&s;k of you, cla&s;hes in &s;ome mea&s;ure with your duty: but women, you know, are whim&s;ical and caprici|ous; whatever they ardently de&s;ire, they are ob&s;ti|nate to obtain: comply therefore, and &s;atisfy my humour. I will for ever love you, and hold you dearer than my life.</P>
<P>Her words were accompanied with &s;o many marks of tenderne&s;s, and &s;uch tran&s;ports, that the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e could re&s;i&s;t no longer. He drew his knife, and cut the black hor&s;e's throat in&s;tantly.
<PB N="106" REF="117">
Then taking out the heart and liver, they were roa&s;ted, and ate in the bed-chamber. In the morning the lady took leave of the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, returned home to her father, and told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed. The vi&s;ier was &s;o overjoyed at it, that he had no time to think how dear it had co&s;t his daughter to play the part &s;he had acted; but went directly to the palace, and told the King the adven|ture. He took care, however, not to &s;ay that Ho&s;|chendan was the lady in que&s;tion, or that it was to &s;atisfy his hatred and envy that his daughter had dared to tempt the integrity of Saddyq.</P>
<P>While the vi&s;ier Tangribirdi was making this re|cital to the King, with all the malice of a &s;tanch courtier, who wi&s;hed ruin to his enemy, the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e had come to him&s;elf, and made mo&s;t bitter reflections on what he had done. How void of &s;en&s;e are men, &s;aid he, to give them&s;elves up to their pa&s;&s;ions! I &s;hould have done much better to have &s;ent away the lady with a flat denial, than to have plea&s;ed her in killing a hor&s;e that was the delight of the King my ma&s;ter. I &s;hould not then have been agitated with all the cruel thoughts which now di&s;turb my quiet. What &s;hall I an&s;wer to the King when he a&s;ks me for his hor&s;e? I, who hitherto have made it a law to my&s;elf ever to tell truth, &s;hall I fly to fal&s;ehood for &s;helter, and &s;hall I dare to be found a liar in the pre&s;ence of my King? This would be adding a new crime to that I have com|mitted. On the other hand, &s;hould I make a true
<PB N="107" REF="118">
confe&s;&s;ion, my &s;incerity mu&s;t co&s;t me my life: what then mu&s;t I determine to do? To lie? Well, be it &s;o. Let me &s;uppo&s;e that I am at court: let me &s;up|po&s;e this cap (taking it off his head, and laying it on the floor) to be Togaltimur: let me &s;ee if I can have the confidence to in&s;i&s;t upon a lie in the face of the King. Entering into his pre&s;ence, I &s;alute him. Saddyq, &s;ays he, let my black hor&s;e be got ready, I mean to ride to-day.&mdash;Sir, an accident has befallen him: ye&s;terday in the evening he would eat nothing we could offer him, and he died at midnight; nor can I imagine the occa&s;ion of his death. How! my black hor&s;e, that carried me &s;o well but ye&s;terday&mdash;is he dead? Why mu&s;t it be him rather than &s;o many others that are in the &s;ame &s;table? What &s;tory is this thou telle&s;t me? Be gone; thou art a liar. Thou ha&s;t either fold my hor&s;e, or el&s;e thou ha&s;t killed him in &s;ome freak. Think not to e&s;cape my vengeance. Thou &s;halt be puni&s;hed according to thy de&s;erts. One of you &s;tab that villain to the heart this mo|ment;&mdash;hack him in pieces.</P>
<P>Togaltimur, pur&s;ued Saddyq, will, no doubt, &s;peak to me in this manner; and &s;uch will be the reward of the fir&s;t lie I ever told in my life. Now let me con&s;ider, if, by telling the truth, I &s;hall fare any better. Saddyq, let my black hor&s;e be got ready: I will ride abroad.&mdash;O King! you &s;ee your &s;ervant in the deepe&s;t affliction. There came to my hou&s;e la&s;t night a lady, who a&s;ked me to have the heart and liver of that hor&s;e, and I had no power to refu&s;e
<PB N="108" REF="119">
her. What! could you kill my fine hor&s;e to gain a lady's favour? One of you go for the executioner; he &s;hall do his office before my face.</P>
<P>Behold, &s;aid the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, what re|ception I am to expect: whether I lie, or whether I tell truth, I am &s;ure to lo&s;e my life. Wretch that I am! Cur&s;ed be the object who&s;e charms have thrown me into this perplexity. While he was bu&s;ied with the&s;e di&s;mal thoughts, came one to tell him the King would &s;peak with him. He in&s;tantly obeyed the order, and found there the vi&s;ier his enemy.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, &s;ays the King, I intend to hunt to-day: &s;addle me the black hor&s;e. Struck with a mortal dread, he an&s;wered in confu&s;ion&mdash;Sir, there happened la&s;t night a misfortune to your &s;er|vant; if your Maje&s;ty commands me, I will tell it you. Tell it, replied the King. La&s;t night, &s;aid the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, as I was &s;itting in my chamber, there came to me a lady in a veil. She &s;at her&s;elf down by me on a &s;opha, unveiled, and &s;hewed me a neck and face of ravi&s;hing beauty: &s;he won my affection; and prevailed on me to promi&s;e her the heart and liver of your black hor&s;e. I an&s;wered without he&s;itation, that I could not con&s;ent to kill a hor&s;e that your Maje&s;ty was &s;o fond of. But the lady threw her&s;elf at my feet, and be&s;ought me in terms &s;o moving, that I had no power to re&s;i&s;t her importunity. This, Sir, is an ingenuous recital of my adventure. I confe&s;s my crime, and am &s;o far from de&s;iring to e&s;cape the
<PB N="109" REF="120">
puni&s;hment I de&s;erve, by telling a lie, that I come of my own accord to &s;ubmit to it.&mdash;There, Sove|reign, is the &s;abre,&mdash;here is my head.</P>
<P>The King turned towards the vi&s;ier, and a&s;ked him in what manner he thought it be&s;t to deal with Saddyq. Sir, an&s;wered the vi&s;ier, overjoyed to be con&s;ulted in this affair, I am of opinion, that he ought to be burnt in a &s;low fire. A man, who has dared to &s;acrifice to his plea&s;ure a hor&s;e that you were fond of, is unworthy of mercy.&mdash;I am not of your opinion, vi&s;ier, replied Togaltimur: I think it more rea&s;onable to pardon a fir&s;t fault, than to pu|ni&s;h it.&mdash;Then addre&s;&s;ing his di&s;cour&s;e to the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, &s;aid, O Saddyq! I am a&s;toni&s;hed at thy &s;incerity, and excu&s;e thy weakne&s;s. Had I been in thy place, I might not only have given my black hor&s;e, but all the hor&s;es in my &s;tables. The allure|ments were too mighty to be re&s;i&s;ted: no man could have been &s;afe again&s;t them. I forgive thee the death of my hor&s;e; and take it &s;o well of thee, that thou ha&s;t told me the truth on this occa&s;ion, that I order a robe of honour to be brought for thee immediately.</P>
<P>When the vi&s;ier Tangribirdi &s;aw that the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e was rewarded, in&s;tead of being pu|ni&s;hed, he was &s;ei&s;ed with a melancholy, that threw him into an illne&s;s, of which he died in a few days, and the fortunate Saddyq was made choice of to &s;ucceed him in his po&s;t of Vi&s;ier.</P>

<P>I recollect reading an account of the behaviour of Colonel Edmonds, who &s;erved in the Dutch wars at Utrecht, which will teach you how you ought to act on the like occa&s;ion. As he was one day &s;tand|ing among his brother officers, one of his country|men who had ju&s;t arrived from Scotland, and who wanted to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the Colonel's favour, came up to him, &s;aluted him, and delivered pretend|ed me&s;&s;ages from my Lord his father, from the Earl his cou&s;in, and various others of his relations, all of whom, he &s;aid were well. "Gentlemen, &s;aid the Colonel, turning to his friends, do not believe that fellow; my father is a poor baker in Edinburgh, and works hard for his livelihood. I am neither related to lord or knight. He has made an impudent at|tack upon my vanity, and has wanted to engage me tacitly to become an accomplice in his fal&s;ehoods, for which contemptible trick, every gentleman who has heard him, mu&s;t, I am &s;ure, de&s;pi&s;e him."</P>
<P>I can never repeat too often to you that the plain truth is be&s;t. When &s;ome young men were brought before Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, and accu&s;ed of
<PB N="112" REF="123">
having libelled him, Pyrrhus a&s;ked them, "Is it true, young men? did you &s;ay &s;uch things?"&mdash;"We did, Sir, replied one of the youths; and I am afraid we &s;hould, at that time, have &s;aid many more if we had had more wine." No denial of the fact, no eva&s;ive an&s;wers could have pleaded &s;o effectually as the &s;imple truth. Pyrrhus admired the &s;incerity, was &s;en&s;ible of the force of the defence, and readily pardoned the error of the offenders.</P>

<HEAD>EQUIVOCATION. The Hi&s;tory of Lady FORREST, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLOTTE and Maria were educated to|gether at an eminent boarding-&s;chool near London: there was little difference in their age, and their per&s;onal accompli&s;hments were equal: but though their families were of the &s;ame rank, yet as Char|lotte was an only child, &s;he was con&s;iderably &s;upe|rior in fortune.</P>
<P>Soon after they were taken home, Charlotte was addre&s;&s;ed by Captain Freeman, who, be&s;ides his com|mi&s;&s;ion in the guards, had a &s;mall paternal e&s;tate: but as her friends hoped for a more advantageous match, the Captain was de&s;ired to forbear his vi&s;its, and the lady to think of him no more. After &s;ome
<PB N="113" REF="124">
fruitle&s;s &s;truggles they acquie&s;ced; but the di&s;con|tent of both were &s;o apparent, that it was thought expedient to remove Mi&s;s into the country. She was &s;ent to her aunt, the Lady Meadows, who with her daughter lived retired at the family &s;eat, more than one hundred miles di&s;tant from the metropolis. After &s;he had repined in this dreary &s;olitude from April to Augu&s;t, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed with a vi&s;it from her father, who brought with him Sir James Forre&s;t, a young gentleman who had ju&s;t &s;ucceeded to a baronet's title and a very large e&s;tate in the &s;ame county. Sir James had good nature and good &s;en&s;e, an agreeable per&s;on and an ea&s;y addre&s;s: Mi&s;s was in&s;en&s;ibly plea&s;ed with his company; her vanity, if not her love, had a new object; a de&s;ire to be de|livered from a &s;tate of dependance and ob&s;curity had almo&s;t ab&s;orbed all the re&s;t: and it is no wonder that this de&s;ire was gratified, when &s;carce any other was felt; or that in compliance with the united &s;olicita|tions of her friends, and her lover, &s;he &s;uffered her|&s;elf within a few weeks to become a lady and a wife. They continued in the country till the beginning of October, and then came up to London, having pre|vailed upon her aunt to accompany them, that Mi&s;s Meadows, with whom the bride had contracted an intimate friend&s;hip, might be gratified with the di|ver&s;ions of the town during the winter.</P>
<P>Captain Freeman, when he heard that Mi&s;s Char|lotte was married, immediately made propo&s;als of marriage to Maria, with whom he became acquaint|ed
<PB N="114" REF="125">
during his vi&s;its to her friend, and &s;oon after mar|ried her.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip of the two young ladies &s;eemed to be rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed by their mar|riage; they were always of the &s;ame party both in the private and public diver&s;ions of the &s;ea&s;on, and vi&s;ited each other without the formalities of me&s;&s;ages and dre&s;s.</P>
<P>But neither Sir James nor Mrs. Freeman could re|flect without unea&s;ine&s;s upon the frequent inter|views which familiarity and confidence had pro|duced between a lover and his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom force only had divided; and though of the&s;e interviews they were them&s;elves witne&s;&s;es, yet Sir James in|&s;en&s;ibly became jealous of his lady, and Mrs. Free|man of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>It happened in the May following, that Sir James went about ten miles out of town to be pre&s;ent at an election of a member of parliament for the county, and was not expected to return till the next day. In the evening his lady took a chair and vi&s;ited Mrs. Freemen: the re&s;t of the company went away early, the Captain was upon guard, Sir James was out of town, and the ladies after &s;upper &s;at down to piquet, and continued the game without once reflecting upon the hour till three in the morning. Lady Forre&s;t would then have gone home; but Mrs. Freeman, perhaps chiefly to conceal a contrary de|&s;ire, importuned her to &s;tay till the Captain came
<PB N="115" REF="126">
in, and at length, with &s;ome reluctance, &s;he con|&s;ented.</P>
<P>About five the Captain came home, and Lady Forre&s;t immediately &s;ent out for a chair: a chair, as it hap|pened, could not be procured; but a hackney coach being brought in its &s;tead, the Captain in&s;i&s;ted upon waiting on her lady&s;hip home. This &s;he refu&s;ed with &s;ome emotion; it is probable that &s;he &s;till re|garded the Captain with le&s;s indifference than &s;he wi&s;hed, and was therefore more &s;en&s;ible of the im|propriety of his offer: but her rea&s;ons for rejecting it, however forcible, being &s;uch as &s;he could not al|ledge, he per&s;i&s;ted, and her re&s;olution was over|borne. By this importunate complai&s;ance the Cap|tain had not only thrown Lady Forre&s;t into confu|&s;ion, but di&s;plea&s;ed his wife: &s;he could not, how|ever, without unpolitene&s;s oppo&s;e it; and left her unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be di&s;covered, &s;he affected a neg|ligence which in &s;ome degree revenged it: &s;he de|&s;ired that when he came back he would not di&s;turb her, for that &s;he &s;hould go directly to bed; and ad|ded with a kind of drow&s;y in&s;en&s;ibliity, "I am more than half a&s;leep already."</P>
<P>Lady Forre&s;t and the Captain were to go from the Haymarket to Gro&s;venor-&s;quare. It was about half an hour after five when they got into the coach; the morning was remarkably fine, the late conte&s;t had &s;haken off all di&s;po&s;ition to &s;leep, and Lady For|re&s;t could not help &s;aying, that &s;he had much rather take a walk into the Park than go home to bed. The
<PB N="116" REF="127">
Captain zealou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;entiment, and propo&s;ed that the coach &s;hould &s;et them down at St. James's Gate. The lady, however, had nearly the &s;ame objections again&s;t being &s;een in the Mall without any other company than the Captain, than &s;he had again&s;t its being known that they were alone together in a hackney coach: &s;he, therefore, to ex|tricate her&s;elf from this &s;econd difficulty, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould call at her father's in Bond-&s;treet, and take her cou&s;in Meadows, whom &s;he knew to be an early ri&s;er, with them. This project was im|mediately put in execution; but Lady Forre&s;t found her cou&s;in indi&s;po&s;ed with a cold. When &s;he had communicated the de&s;ign of this early vi&s;it, Mi&s;s Meadows intreated her to give up her walk in the Park, to &s;tay till the family ro&s;e, and go home after breakfa&s;t: "No, replied Lady Forre&s;t, I am de|termined upon a walk; but as I mu&s;t fir&s;t get rid of Captain Freeman, I will &s;end down word that I will take your advice." A &s;ervant was accordingly di&s;patched to acquaint the Captain, who was waiting below, that Mi&s;s Meadows was indi&s;po&s;ed, and had engaged Lady Forre&s;t to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Captain di&s;charged the coach; but being piqued at the behaviour of his wife, and feeling that flow of &s;pirits which u&s;ually returns with the morn|ing even to tho&s;e who have not &s;lept in the night, he had no de&s;ire to go home, and therefore re&s;olved to enjoy the fine morning in the Park alone.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="128">Lady Forre&s;t not doubting but that the Captain would immediately return home, congratulated her|&s;elf upon her deliverance; but at the &s;ame time, to indulge her de&s;ire of a walk, followed him into the Park.</P>
<P>The Captain had reached the top of the Mall, and turning back, met her before &s;he had advanced two hundred yards beyond the palace. The moment &s;he perceived him, the remembrance of her me&s;&s;age, the motives that produced it, the detection of its fal&s;e|hood, and di&s;covery of its de&s;ign, her di&s;appoint|ment and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that very &s;ituation which &s;he had &s;o much rea&s;on to avoid, all concurred to cover her with confu&s;ion which it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to hide: pride and good-breeding were, how|ever, &s;till predominant over truth and prudence; &s;he was &s;till zealous to remove from the Captain's mind any &s;u&s;picion of a de&s;ign to &s;hun him, and there|fore with an effort perhaps equal to that of a hero who &s;miles upon the rack, &s;he affected an air of gaiety, &s;aid &s;he was glad to &s;ee him, and as an ex|cu&s;e for her me&s;&s;age and her conduct, prattled &s;omething about the ficklene&s;s of woman's mind, and concluded with ob&s;erving that &s;he changed her's too often ever to be mad. By this conduct a retreat was rendered impo&s;&s;ible, and they walked together till between eight and nine: but the clouds having in&s;en&s;ibly gathered, and a &s;udden &s;hower falling ju&s;t as they reached Spring-gardens, they went out in|&s;tead
<PB N="118" REF="129">
of going back; and the Captain having put the lady into a chair, took his leave.</P>
<P>It happened that Sir James, contrary to his fir&s;t purpo&s;e, had returned from his journey at night. He learnt from the &s;ervants that his lady was gone to Captain Freeman's, and was &s;ecretly di&s;plea&s;ed that &s;he had made this vi&s;it when he was ab&s;ent; an in|cident which, however trifling in it&s;elf, was by the magic of jealou&s;y, &s;welled into importance: yet upon recollection, he reproved him&s;elf for this di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;ince the pre&s;ence of the Captain's lady would &s;uf|ficiently &s;ecure the honour of his own. While he was &s;truggling with the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, they increa&s;ed both in number and &s;trength, in proportion as the night wore away. At one he went to bed; but he pa&s;&s;ed the night in agonies of terror and re&s;entment, doubting whether the ab&s;ence of his lady was the effect of accident or de&s;ign, li&s;tening to every noi&s;e, and bewildering him&s;elf in a multitude of extrava|gant &s;uppo&s;itions. He ro&s;e again at break of day; and after &s;everal hours of &s;u&s;pence and irre&s;olution, whether to wait the i&s;&s;ue, or go out for intelligence, the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of curio&s;ity prevailed, and about eight he &s;et out for Captain Freeman's; but left word with his &s;ervants, that he was gone to a neighbour|ing coffee-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Freeman, who&s;e affected indifference and di&s;&s;imulation of a de&s;ign to go immediately to bed, contributed to prevent the Captain's return had, during his ab&s;ence, &s;uffered inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;quiet:
<PB N="119" REF="130">
&s;he had, indeed, neither intention to go to bed, nor inclination to &s;leep; &s;he walked backward and for|ward in her chamber, di&s;tracted with jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, till &s;he was informed that Sir James was below, and de&s;ired to &s;ee her. When &s;he came down, he di&s;covered that &s;he had been in tears; his fear was now more alarmed than his jealou&s;y, and he concluded that &s;ome fatal accident had befallen his wife; but he &s;oon learnt that &s;he and the Cap|tain had gone from thence at five in the morning, and that he was not yet returned. Mrs. Freeman, by Sir James's enquiry, knew that the lady had not been at home: her &s;u&s;picions, therefore, were con|firmed; and in her jealou&s;y, which to prevent a duel &s;he laboured to conceal, Sir James found new cau&s;e for his own. He determined, however, to wait with as much decency as po&s;&s;ible, till the Captain came in; and perhaps two per&s;ons were never more em|barra&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of each other. While breakfa&s;t was getting ready, Dr. Tattle came to pay Mrs. Freeman a morning vi&s;it; and to the un&s;peak|able grief of both the lady and her gue&s;t, was imme|diately admitted. Doctor Tattle is one of tho&s;e male go&s;&s;ips who, in common opinion, are the mo&s;t diverting company in the world. The Doctor &s;aw that Mrs. Freeman was low &s;pirited, and made &s;e|veral efforts to divert her, but without &s;ucce&s;s: at la&s;t he declared, with an air of ironical importance, that he could tell her &s;uch news as would make her look grave for &s;omething; "The Captain, &s;ays he,
<PB N="120" REF="131">
has ju&s;t huddled a lady into a chair at the door of a bagnio, near Spring-gardens." He &s;oon perceived that this &s;peech was received with emotions very dif|ferent from tho&s;e he intended to produce; and there|fore added, "that &s;he need not, however, be jealous; for notwith&s;tanding the manner in which he had re|lated the incident, the lady was certainly a woman of character, as he in&s;tantly di&s;covered by her mein and appearance:" this particular confirmed the &s;u&s;pi|cion it was intended to remove; and the Doctor finding that he was not &s;o good company as u&s;ual, took his leave, but was met at the door by the Captain, who brought him back. His pre&s;ence, however in&s;ignificant, impo&s;ed &s;ome re&s;traint upon the re&s;t of the company; and Sir James, with as good an appearance of jocularity as he could a&s;&s;ume, a&s;ked the Captain "What he had done with his wife?" The Captain, with &s;ome irre&s;olution, re|plied, that "he had left her early in the morning at her father's; and that having made a point of waiting on her home, &s;he &s;ent word down that her cou&s;in Meadows was indi&s;po&s;ed, and had engaged her to breakfa&s;t." The Captain, who knew nothing of the anecdote that had been communicated by the Doctor, judged by appearances that it was prudent thus indirectly to lie, by concealing the truth both from Sir James and his wife: he &s;uppo&s;ed, indeed, that Sir James would immediately enquire after his wife, at her father's, and learn that &s;he did not &s;tay there to breakfa&s;t; but as it would not follow that
<PB N="121" REF="132">
they had been together, he left her to account for her ab&s;ence as &s;he &s;hould think fit, taking for granted that what he had concealed &s;he would al&s;o conceal for the &s;ame rea&s;ons; or if &s;he &s;hould not, as he had affirmed nothing contrary to truth, he might pretend to have concealed it in je&s;t. Sir James, as &s;oon as he had received this intelligence, took his leave with &s;ome appearance of &s;atisfaction, and was followed by the Doctor.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mrs. Freeman and the Captain were alone, &s;he que&s;tioned him with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s about the lady whom he had been &s;een to put into a chair. When he had heard that this in|cident had been related in the pre&s;ence of Sir James, he was greatly alarmed le&s;t Lady Forre&s;t &s;hould in|crea&s;e his &s;u&s;picions, by attempting to conceal that which, by a &s;eries of enquiry to which he was now &s;timulated, he would probably di&s;cover: he con|demned this conduct in him&s;elf, and as the mo&s;t effectual means at once to quiet the mind of his wife, and obtain her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he told her all that had happened, and his apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;e|quences: he al&s;o urged her to go directly to Mi&s;s Meadows, by whom his account would be con|firmed, and from whom &s;he might learn farther intel|ligence of Sir James; and to find &s;ome way to ac|quaint Lady Forre&s;t with her danger, and admoni&s;h her to conceal nothing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Freeman was convinced of the Captain's &s;incerity, not only by the advice which he urged her
<PB N="122" REF="133">
to give to Lady Forre&s;t, but by the con&s;i&s;tency of the &s;tory and the manner in which he was affected. Her jealou&s;y was changed into pity for her friend, and apprehen&s;ion for her hu&s;band. She ha&s;ted to Mi&s;s Meadows, and learnt that Sir James had en|quired of the &s;ervant for his lady, and was told that &s;he had been there early with Captain Freeman, but went away &s;oon after him: &s;he related to Mi&s;s Meadows all that had happened, and thinking it at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible that Sir James might not go directly home, &s;he wrote the following letter to his lady:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady Forre&s;t,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for you. Sir James has &s;u&s;picions which truth only can remove, and of which my indi&s;cretion is the cau&s;e. If I had not concealed my de&s;ire of the Captain's return, your de&s;ign to di&s;engage your&s;elf from him, which I learn from Mi&s;s Meadows, would have been ef|fected. Sir James breakfa&s;ted with me in the Hay-market; and has &s;ince called at your father's, from whence I write: he knows that your &s;tay here was &s;hort, and has rea&s;on to believe the Captain put you into a chair &s;ome hours afterwards at Spring-gardens. I hope therefore, my dear lady, that this will reach your hands time enough to prevent your concealing any thing. It would have been better if Sir James had known nothing, for then you would not have been &s;u&s;pected; but now he mu&s;t know

</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter was given to a chairman, and he was ordered to &s;ay he brought it from the milliner's; becau&s;e if it &s;hould be known to come from Mrs. Freeman, and &s;hould fall by accident into Sir James's hands, his curio&s;ity might prompt him to read it, and his jealou&s;y to que&s;tion the lady without communi|cating the contents.</P>
<P>Sir James being convinced that his lady and the Captain had pa&s;&s;ed the morning at a bagnio, by the an&s;wer which he received at her father's, went di|rectly home. His lady was ju&s;t arrived before him, and had not recovered from the confu&s;ion and dread which &s;eized her when &s;he heard that Sir James came to town the night before, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant anticipated the con&s;equences of her own indi&s;cretion. She was told he was then at the coffee-hou&s;e, and in a few minutes was thrown into an univer&s;al tremor upon hearing him knock at the door. He perceived her di&s;tre&s;s not with compa&s;&s;ion but rage, becau&s;e he believed it to proceed from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt: he turned pale, and his lips quivered; but he &s;o far re&s;trained his pa&s;&s;ion as to a&s;k her, without
<PB N="124" REF="135">
invective, "where, and how &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the night?" She replied, "at Captain Freeman's; that the Captain was upon guard, that &s;he &s;at up with his lady till he came in, and then in&s;i&s;ting to &s;ee her home, &s;he would &s;uffer the coach to go no farther than her father's, where he left her early in the morning:" &s;he had not fortitude to relate the &s;equel, but &s;topped with &s;ome appearance of irre&s;olution and terror. Sir James then a&s;ked, "if &s;he came directly from her father's home." This que&s;tion, and the manner in which it was a&s;ked, increa&s;ed her confu|&s;ion: to appear to have &s;topped &s;hort in her narra|tive, &s;he thought would be an implication of guilt, as it would betray a de&s;ire of concealment: but the pa&s;t could not be recalled, and &s;he was impelled by equivocation to fal&s;ehood, from which, however, &s;he would have been kept back by fear, if Sir James had not deceived her into a belief that he had been no farther than the neighbourhood. After the&s;e tumultuous reflections which pa&s;&s;ed in a moment, &s;he ventured to affirm, that "&s;he &s;taid with Mi&s;s Mea|dows till eight, and then came home:" but &s;he uttered this fal&s;ehood with &s;uch marks of guilt and &s;hame, which &s;he had indeed no otherwi&s;e than by this fal&s;ehood incurred or de&s;erved, that Sir James no more doubted her infidelity than her exi&s;tence. As her &s;tory was the &s;ame with the Captain's, and as one had concealed the truth, and the other denied it, he con|cluded there was a confederacy between them; and determining fir&s;t to bring the Captain to account, he
<PB N="125" REF="136">
turned from her abruptly, and immediately left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the door he met the chairman who had been di&s;patched by Mrs. Freeman to his lady; and fierce|ly interrogating him what was his bu&s;ine&s;s, the man produced the letter, and &s;aying, as he had been or|dered, that he had brought it from Mrs. Fa&s;hion, Sir James &s;natched it from him, and muttering &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of contempt and re&s;entment, thru&s;t it into his pocket.</P>
<P>It happened that Sir James did not find the Cap|tain at home; he, therefore, left a billet, in which he reque&s;ted to &s;ee him at a neighbouring tavern, and added, that he had put on his &s;word.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his lady, dreading a di&s;covery of the fal&s;ehood which &s;he had a&s;&s;erted, di&s;patched a billet to Captain Freeman; in which &s;he conjured him, as a man of honour, for particular rea&s;ons, not to own to Sir James, or any other per&s;on, that he had &s;een her after he had left her at her father's: &s;he al&s;o wrote to her cou&s;in Meadows, intreating, that if &s;he was que&s;tioned by Sir James, he might be told that &s;he &s;taid with her till eight o'clock, an hour at which only her&s;elf and the &s;ervants were up.</P>
<P>The billet to Mi&s;s Meadows came &s;oon after the chairman had returned with an account of what had happened to the letter; and Mrs. Freeman was ju&s;t gone in great ha&s;te to relate the accident to the Cap|tain, as it was of importance that he &s;hould know it before his next interview with Sir James: but the
<PB N="126" REF="137">
Captain had been at home before her, and had re|ceived both Sir James's billet and that of his lady. He went immediately to the tavern, and, in|quiring for Sir James Forre&s;t, was &s;hewn into a a back room one pair of &s;tairs: Sir James received his &s;alutation without reply, and in&s;tantly bolted the door. His jealou&s;y was complicated with that in|dignation and contempt, which a &s;en&s;e of injury from a per&s;on of inferior rank, never fails to produce; he, therefore, demanded of the Captain, in a haughty tone, "Whether he had not that morning been in company with his wife, after he had left her at her father's?" The Captain, who was incen&s;ed at Sir James's manner, and deemed him&s;elf engaged in honour to keep the lady's &s;ecret, an&s;wered, that "from what he had &s;aid in the morning, no man had a right to &s;uppo&s;e he had &s;een the lady afterwards; that to in&s;inuate the contrary, was obliquely to charge him with a fal&s;ehood; that he was bound to an&s;wer no &s;uch que&s;tions, till they were properly ex|plained; and that as a gentleman, he was prepared to vindicate his honour." Sir James ju&s;tly deemed this reply an equivocation and an in&s;ult; and being no longer able to re&s;train his rage, he cur&s;ed the Captain as a liar and a &s;coundrel, and at the &s;ame time &s;triking him a violent blow with his fi&s;t, drew his &s;word, and put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence. Whatever de&s;ign the Captain might have had to bring his friend to temper, and reconcile him to his wife, when he fir&s;t entered the room, he was now
<PB N="127" REF="138">
equally enraged, and indeed had &s;uffered equal in|dignity; he, therefore, drew at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and after a few de&s;perate pa&s;&s;es on both &s;ides, he received a wound in his brea&s;t, and reeling back|ward a few paces, fell down.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e had brought many people to the door of the room, and it was forced open ju&s;t as the Captain received his wound: Sir James was &s;ecured, and a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched for a &s;urgeon. In the mean time the Captain perceived him&s;elf to be dy|ing; and whatever might before have been his opi|nion of right and wrong, and honour and &s;hame, he now thought all di&s;&s;imulation criminal, and that his murderer had a right to that truth which he thought it meritorious to deny him when he was his friend; he, therefore, earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;peak a few words to him in private. This reque&s;t was immediately granted; the per&s;ons who had ru&s;hed in withdrew, contenting them&s;elves to keep guard at the door; and the Captain, beckoning Sir James to kneel down by him, then told him, that however his lady might have been &s;urprized or betrayed by pride or fear into di&s;&s;imulation or fal&s;ehood, &s;he was innocent of the crime which he &s;uppo&s;ed her &s;olicitous to conceal. He then briefly related all the events as they had happened; and at la&s;t, gra&s;ping his hand, urged him to e&s;cape from the window, that he might be a friend to his widow and to his child, if its birth &s;hould not be prevented by the death of its father. Sir James yielded to the force of this motive, and e&s;caped as
<PB N="128" REF="139">
the Captain had directed. In his way to Dover he read the letter which he had taken from the chair|man, and the next po&s;t inclo&s;ed it in the following to his lady.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Charlotte,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am the mo&s;t wretched of all men; but I do not upbraid you as the cau&s;e: would to God that I were not more guilty than you! We are the mar|tyrs of di&s;&s;imulation. By di&s;&s;imulation dear Cap|tain Freeman was induced to wa&s;te tho&s;e hours with you, which he would otherwi&s;e have enjoyed with the poor unhappy di&s;&s;embler his wife. Tru&s;ting in the &s;ucce&s;s of di&s;&s;imulation, you was tempted to venture into the Park, where you met him whom you wi&s;hed to &s;hun. By detecting di&s;&s;imulation in the Captain, my &s;u&s;picions were increa&s;ed; and by di&s;&s;imulation and fal&s;ehood you confirmed them. But your di&s;&s;imulation and fal&s;ehood were the effects of mine; your's were ineffectual, mine &s;ucceeded: for I left word that I was gone no farther than the coffee-hou&s;e, that you might not &s;u&s;pect I had learn|ed too much to be deceived. By the &s;ucce&s;s of a lie put into the mouth of a chairman, I was pre|vented from reading a letter which at la&s;t would have undeceived me; and by per&s;i&s;ting in di&s;&s;imula|tion, the Captain has made his friend a fugitive, and his wife a widow. Thus does in&s;incerity terminate in mi&s;ery and confu&s;ion, whether, in its immediate purpo&s;e, it &s;ucceed, or be di&s;appointed. O my dear
<PB N="129" REF="140">
Charlotte! if ever we meet again,&mdash;to meet again in happine&s;s is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;if ever we meet again, let us re&s;olve to be &s;incere: to be &s;incere is to be wife, innocent, and &s;afe. We venture to commit faults which &s;hame or fear would prevent, if we did not hope to conceal them by a lie. But in the labyrinth of fal&s;ehood, men meet tho&s;e evils which they &s;eek to avoid.&mdash;As in the &s;trait path of truth alone they can &s;ee before them, in the &s;trait path of truth alone they can pur&s;ue felicity with &s;ucce&s;s.

<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YESTERDAY you beheld me very anxious to convince you of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;trict adherence to truth. I cannot, perhaps, better continue to effect this, than by &s;hewing you the importance of accu&s;toming your&s;elves to <HI>&s;ilence,</HI> when
<PB N="130" REF="141">
upon the affairs of others. This will in&s;en&s;ibly give you habits of &s;ecre&s;y, and teach you to avoid de|traction, two very e&s;&s;ential duties of &s;ociety. We will begin with the fir&s;t. To &s;hew you how highly the wi&s;e&s;t of men have always reverenced tho&s;e who were careful not to betray the &s;ecrets with which they were entru&s;ted, I will remind you of the be|haviour of Papyrius, and the honour conferred on him in con&s;equence of it, by that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, the Senate of antient Rome.</P>
<P>It was once the cu&s;tom for the &s;enators to take their &s;ons with them to the &s;enate-hou&s;e, and among the&s;e did Papyrius Praete&s;tatus follow his father. One day when an affair of great con&s;equence had been in debate, and deferred till the morrow, a par|ticular charge was given to all not to mention it abroad. The mother of the boy, Papyrius when he came home, a&s;ked him what the &s;enators had been doing that day; to which he replied, it was a &s;ecret that mu&s;t not be di&s;clo&s;ed. This an&s;wer, in&s;tead of giving &s;atisfaction, as it ought to have done, only enflamed her curio&s;ity; and, when entreaties had no effect, made her proceed to violence, in or|der to extort the &s;ecret. Papyrius, who was quite young, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to prevail, told her at la&s;t, that he might avoid di&s;clo&s;ing the &s;ecrets of the &s;enate, "it had been debated, whether it would be mo&s;t advantageous for one man to have two wives, or for one woman to have two hu&s;bands." The mother upon this immediately quits Papyrius, and
<PB N="131" REF="142">
running about among her female acquaintance, who were as weak as her&s;elf, per&s;uades them to accom|pany her the next day to the &s;enate. The &s;enators, hearing the uproar, enquired what was the matter? Upon which Papyrius &s;tood up, and told them in what manner he had been obliged to act. The fa|thers were all &s;o much &s;urprized and plea&s;ed with the invention, the re&s;olution, and the &s;ecre&s;y of the boy, that they returned him public thanks; but in|&s;tantly made a decree, that the &s;ons of &s;enators &s;hould not in future be admitted to hear their deli|berations, Papyrius alone excepted.</P>
<P>Papyrius you &s;ee, children, notwith&s;tanding his youth, had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the dignity and import|ance of the tru&s;t which had been placed in him by the &s;enators. The per&s;on who&s;e &s;tory we will now read, had neither his prudence nor his fortitude.</P>

<HEAD>SECRESY: Or the ENRAGED LOVER.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG gentleman, de&s;cended of a good family, but who&s;e e&s;tate was very much encumber|ed by the mi&s;management of his parents, was on the point of retrieving his fortune by a marriage with a lady, who, be&s;ides eight thou&s;and pounds in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was the only child of one of the mo&s;t wealthy merchants in Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>The court&s;hip between them had been kept ex|tremely &s;ecret;&mdash;the lady had made no one her con|fidante
<PB N="132" REF="143">
in the affair;&mdash;the gentleman had ob&s;erved the &s;ame caution, till, a few days before that which &s;he had appointed for the completion of their mu|tual wi&s;hes, he imparted the &s;ecret of his approach|ing happine&s;s to a friend, from whom before he had never concealed any thing.</P>
<P>This per&s;on had a wife whom he extremely loved, and who&s;e integrity he doubted not. He knew &s;he wi&s;hed well to his friend, and that &s;he would rejoice to hear of the good fortune he was &s;o near enjoying, therefore communicated the &s;ecret to her almo&s;t as &s;oon as he was informed of it him&s;elf; but charged her at the &s;ame time to make no mention of it, which &s;he faithfully promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>It proved, however, that her mind had no &s;uch retentive quality as her fond hu&s;band imagined. A young lady of her acquaintance happening to vi&s;it her that &s;ame day, and &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e on the ill &s;ituation of the intended bridegroom's affairs com|ing on the tapis, the wife could not forbear crying out,&mdash;'Well, well, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee him redeem all.'&mdash;'As how!' demanded the other.&mdash;'By a marriage with &s;ome great fortune,' replied &s;he.&mdash; 'Marriage!' re&s;umed the young lady,&mdash;'It mu&s;t then be with &s;ome worn out virgin of four&s;core at her la&s;t prayers.'&mdash;'Not &s;o, I can a&s;&s;ure you,' &s;aid the wife, 'but a blooming young creature of &s;carce eighteen, with a fortune of eight thou&s;and pounds in her own hands, and heire&s;s to one of the fir&s;t merchants of Bri&s;tol.'&mdash;'You amaze me,' returned
<PB N="133" REF="144">
the other,&mdash;'Pray who is &s;he?'&mdash;'You mu&s;t ex|cu&s;e me for that, my dear,' an&s;wered &s;he, 'I am enjoined &s;ecre&s;y; but I can tell you, the wedding will be celebrated in a few days, and then all will come out. In the mean time you may have leave to gue&s;s.'</P>
<P>After what &s;he had &s;aid, the other could not be much at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover the per&s;on &s;poken of.&mdash; 'You certainly mu&s;t mean Mi&s;s ****. The de|&s;cription you give corre&s;ponds with no other wo|man in this town.'&mdash;'You are perfectly right,' re|plied &s;he; 'but be &s;ure you tell nobody.'</P>
<P>Little did this unhappy wife imagine, to whom &s;he had blabbed &s;o dangerous a &s;ecret. This lady had been courted by the gentleman in que&s;tion, but, her fortune not agreeing with his circum&s;tances, the match did not &s;ucceed. She had loved him, and her re&s;entment for his not re&s;olving to &s;uffer every thing for her &s;ake, was adequate to the tenderne&s;s &s;he had before had for him; and the opportunity now given her for rendering him as unhappy as he had made her, filled her with an ill-natured &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>She no &s;ooner got home, than &s;he wrote an ano|nymous letter to the father of her rival, acquainting him with the whole &s;tory of his daughter's intended marriage.&mdash;The old gentleman was equally &s;urpriz|ed and enraged; he &s;earched his daughter's cabinet, and found letters which confirmed the truth of the advice he had received. He immediately locked the young lady into her chamber, &s;uffering no one
<PB N="134" REF="145">
to come near her, but an aunt, who was as inflexi|ble to compa&s;&s;ion for the woes of love, as a Spa|ni&s;h Duenna. On the third day, which was agreed upon by the lovers for the celebration of their nup|tials, he &s;ent her to a place, where it was pretty certain &s;he could hold no corre&s;pondence unknown to him.</P>
<P>Some hours before her departure, &s;he found means to write to her lover.&mdash;The contents of the letter were the&s;e:</P>

<P><PB N="135" REF="146">The poor lady had but ju&s;t time to in&s;truct her maid what &s;he &s;hould &s;ay on the delivery of this letter, when, though it was no more than four o'clock in the morning, &s;he was called down &s;tairs, and, accompanied by her aunt, hurried into a coach, and carried,&mdash;no one in the family knew whither.</P>
<P>The maid about &s;ix executed her commi&s;&s;ion.

<P>The other, knowing this was the day agreed on for the marriage, had imagined that he had been called upon to be witne&s;s of it; but was now &s;o much &s;urprized, that he had no power to make the lea&s;t reply.

<P>If anything could have added to the lover's fury, it mu&s;t have been the acknowledgment made by the other, of having told the &s;ecret to his wife.

<P>The wife, on this dreadful alarm, jumped out of bed, and, with only a loo&s;e night-gown about her, came running in, crying,&mdash;'What has occa&s;ioned this &s;hocking &s;cene!'&mdash;'I hope,' replied her hu&s;|band, 'that you your&s;elf have not occa&s;ioned it;&mdash; and that you never mentioned what I told you in relation to this gentleman's court&s;hip with Mi&s;s ****?'&mdash;'Oh Heavens!' returned &s;he, 'is it on this &s;core that you fight?'&mdash;'An&s;wer not one que&s;tion with another,' re&s;umed he fiercely, 'but &s;peak the truth at once.'</P>

<HEAD>The HERDSMAN. A FABLE.</HEAD>
<P>A certain herd&s;man verified the maxim that 'every man may acquire a character in his &s;tation.' His reputation, which was the re&s;ult of hone&s;ty and plain &s;en&s;e, made him con&s;iderable in his village. All men confided in his word. Matters of property in di&s;pute were depo&s;ited in his hands, till the cau&s;e was decided. His benevolence of temper di&s;po&s;ed him always to reconcile animo&s;ities, and his &s;trength of under&s;tanding qualified him for a right deci&s;ion, whenever his neighbours appointed him arbitrator.</P>
<P>As a clear &s;ky gradually di&s;pels black clouds, and enlightens the whole hemi&s;phere; &s;o the report of a good name extends to remote parts, and is univer|&s;ally well received. The King, who at that time ruled over the country, was a mild and judicious Prince. He di&s;pen&s;ed his favours impartially to men of merit. He &s;ent for the herd&s;man, tried his hone&s;ty at one time, and his under&s;tanding at ano|ther; and, as the latter improved, he rai&s;ed him from one employment to another, till our herd&s;man arrived, without artifice or ambition, as it were with the wings of a gentle breeze, to the highe&s;t pitch of fortune; and had &s;uch weight and authority, that no re&s;olution of con&s;equence was taken, with|out previou&s;ly con&s;ulting him. Good coun&s;el is the compa&s;s, by which a Prince &s;teers his cour&s;e. Whil&s;t he follows that, all his mea&s;ures &s;ucceed; which was the ca&s;e here. The King was in no
<PB N="141" REF="152">
danger, for he was beloved. The people re&s;ted in peace, for the labourer was &s;ecure of his pay. In|nocence was free from anxiety, for &s;he could rely upon protection. Vice only trembled, for &s;he was pro&s;ecuted; and envy &s;at watching and di&s;turbed by her &s;ide, for virtue was crowned by fortune.</P>
<P>It happened, during this general tranquillity, that an aged man, who had formerly an intimacy with the herd&s;man, returned home after a di&s;tant journey. His fir&s;t inclination was to &s;ee the court, in order to wor&s;hip that &s;un which diffu&s;ed &s;o fruit|ful a warmth over all the country. He was not a little &s;urprized to &s;ee the herd&s;man exalted to the King's right hand; while the herd&s;man, who&s;e mind continued invariably the &s;ame, rejoiced, in the mid&s;t of his grandeur, at the arrival of his friend.</P>
<P>In the evening, when they were retired to private conver&s;ation, the old experienced man thought him|&s;elf obliged to admoni&s;h his friend. "You are now, &s;aid he, in the &s;lippery road of honour, and re&s;emble the blind man, who in &s;earching for the &s;taff he had lo&s;t, among &s;tones and bu&s;hes, picked up a &s;erpent &s;tiff with cold. A prudent traveller, who was pa&s;&s;|ing by, advi&s;ed him to throw it away; but the un|happy blind man rejected his coun&s;el, and thought him&s;elf happy in a &s;afe &s;upport; till the &s;erpent was refre&s;hed, and bit him mortally. Your own good &s;en&s;e, continued he, will enable you to make the application."</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="153">The herd&s;man was &s;omewhat affected by the &s;tory, but being con&s;cious of no evil him&s;elf, and not ap|prehen&s;ive of any de&s;ign again&s;t him, per&s;evered in the faithful and diligent di&s;charge of the duties of his office. He might have continued in the &s;ame to the day of his death, had not the artful practices of the envious, after &s;everal far-fetched attempts, at la&s;t &s;ucceeded to render him &s;u&s;pected by the King. Their fir&s;t pretence was, that the herd&s;man had built him&s;elf a &s;umptuous hou&s;e, by extorting money from the poor, and gratifications from the rich. The King was determined to believe no eyes but his own, in a matter which concerned the reputa|tion of an hone&s;t man. He made a vi&s;it to the herd&s;man, and &s;urveyed his dwelling, but found neither the building, nor the decorations, nor the furniture unequal to his &s;tation, nor the expence greater than con&s;i&s;ted with the liberal rewards him|&s;elf had conferred upon him. The herd&s;man was therefore commended for not di&s;gracing his rank, and for admini&s;tering to the laborious part of man|kind that &s;upport, which they have a right to expect from men of power and fortune. The King &s;um|moned the envious accu&s;ers, and remon&s;trated to them on the fal&s;ity of their charge. They invented another fal&s;ehood to excu&s;e the former; for no ini|quity is &s;o fruitful as this; one deceit begets another, unle&s;s the fir&s;t be &s;tifled in its birth. "It is very true, Sir, &s;aid they, he is cautious of expo&s;ing his trea&s;ures to public view; but there is a che&s;t by his
<PB N="143" REF="154">
bed-&s;ide, filled with gold and jewels; which con|tain more property than all your &s;ubjects po&s;|&s;e&s;s." The King, being a lover of truth, repaired once more to the herd&s;man's dwelling. He found the che&s;t, and commanded him to open it; the herd&s;man begged to be excu&s;ed, a&s;&s;uring him that it contained nothing worthy of any one's curio|&s;ity; but the King's &s;u&s;picions were heightened by the earne&s;tne&s;s with which he declined the order. The che&s;t was opened, and what can you imagine were the contents? No more than a plain herd&s;|man's coat, and a &s;taff &s;tripped of its bark. The herd&s;man, upon this, depo&s;ited his fine cloaths in the che&s;t, and, recollecting his friend's fable of the blind man and the &s;erpent, put on his former dre&s;s, walked to his native home, and could not be pre|vailed with, by the intreaties or promi&s;es of the King, to depart from his re&s;olution of fini&s;hing his days in the cottage where he had drawn his fir&s;t breath.</P>

<HEAD>DETRACTION: Or the Story of DORANTES.</HEAD>
<P>A certain gentleman who&s;e real name I &s;hall conceal under that of Dorantes, was married to a
<PB N="144" REF="155">
young lady of equal birth and fortune, and who, without being a celebrated beauty, was perfectly agreeable. He behaved with great tenderne&s;s to|wards her,&mdash;&s;he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of him;&mdash;no couple could live more happily together, till an un|lucky propen&s;ity, to which women are too prone, di&s;&s;olved the cement of their union, and made both as wretched as before they had been ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The wife of Dorantes was extremely intimate with a young widow, to whom I &s;hall give the name of Clara;&mdash;they were acquainted in their childhood, and the change of their conditions afterwards had made no alteration in the &s;entiments of either. Sel|dom two days pa&s;&s;ed, without their &s;eeing each other; and, as Dorantes &s;taid pretty much at home, he was very glad of a third per&s;on to make up a party for ombre.</P>
<P>Clara was very hand&s;ome,&mdash;had a regular &s;et of features,&mdash;fine hair,&mdash;fine teeth;&mdash;and, above all, a remarkably delicate complexion.&mdash;Dorantes had &s;e|veral times, occa&s;ionally, mentioned tho&s;e perfections in her to his wife; which, though, as will appear by the &s;equel, they not a little di&s;plea&s;ed her, &s;he &s;eemed not to take notice of, till one day, as they were talking together on the beauty of &s;ome ladies of their acquaintance, he &s;aid,&mdash;"Well, I &s;ee none that are half &s;o agreeable as your friend Clara."&mdash; "Clara looks very well altogether, replied &s;he gravely; but it co&s;ts her a great deal of pains to do &s;o."&mdash;"What pains," cried he.&mdash;"Why, to tell
<PB N="145" REF="156">
you the truth, re&s;umed &s;he, all tho&s;e things you ad|mire in her are nothing but mere art;&mdash;&s;he has &s;even or eight fal&s;e teeth, to my knowledge;&mdash;then, as to her hair it is naturally inclined to red; but &s;he dyes it with a certain water, which turns it to that fine black it now appears; and, for her complexion, &s;he u&s;es both white and red; be&s;ides, &s;he always &s;leeps in a night-ma&s;k, to repel pimples."&mdash;"Im|po&s;&s;ible, my dear!" re&s;umed he, "I have eyes as well as you, and can ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h between what is natural and what is artificial."</P>
<P>"You men are often deceived in the&s;e things, an&s;wered &s;he; if you were to &s;ee her in a morning, you would be convinced of the truth of what I tell you, and a great deal more; but I love Clara, and would not, for the world, &s;ay what I have done to any one, except your&s;elf."&mdash;"You are in the right, &s;aid he with &s;ome ill humour; for no-body would believe you, if you did."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry, then, I ever mentioned it to you &s;aid &s;he a little haughtily."&mdash;"It might have been better you had not, replied he &s;ternly;&mdash;becau&s;e it gives me no very favourable idea, either of your ge|nero&s;ity or your &s;incerity; and but confirms what I have often heard of your &s;ex;&mdash;that no one wo|man ever &s;poke well of the beauty of another."&mdash; With the&s;e words, he &s;natched up his hat, and went directly out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The wife, who had never before been &s;poken to in this &s;harp manner by her hu&s;band, now, doubtle&s;s,
<PB N="146" REF="157">
repented of what &s;he had &s;aid; but the words were gone out of her mouth,&mdash;&s;he could not call them back; and pride and &s;hame would not &s;uffer her to confe&s;s &s;he had been guilty of uttering a fal&s;ity.&mdash; From this time forward, &s;he perceived a vi&s;ible decay in that tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect with which &s;he had been treated by Dorantes, and began to hate the innocent Clara for a misfortune which &s;he had in|tirely brought upon her&s;elf; &s;he behaved to her with great coldne&s;s, and, at length, ordered her &s;ervants to &s;ay &s;he was not at home, whenever &s;he came. The fair widow, on this, di&s;continued her vi&s;its; and, as &s;he knew &s;he had done nothing to de&s;erve the u&s;age &s;he received, thought it beneath her to inquire into the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>From what &s;mall beginnings do, &s;ometimes, the greate&s;t feuds and di&s;contents ari&s;e!&mdash;Dorantes, finding that Clara did not come to the hou&s;e as u&s;ual, doubted not but that his wife had either per|&s;onally affronted her, or &s;poke of her, to others, in the &s;ame manner &s;he had done to him; and, reflect|ing deeply on the inju&s;tice of the thing, could not keep him&s;elf from entertaining a &s;ecret contempt, mixed with indignation, for the author.</P>
<P>Chance contributed to heighten in him this ill humour towards his wife:&mdash;he met Clara one day by accident, and, acco&s;ting her with his accu&s;tomed politene&s;s, a&s;ked the rea&s;on why his wife had been &s;o long deprived of her agreeable company.&mdash;To which &s;he very gravely replied:&mdash;That &s;he had made
<PB N="147" REF="158">
&s;everal vi&s;its, none of which being returned, &s;he could not flatter her&s;elf that her company was any longer acceptable. "Oh, madam, &s;aid he, I beg you will not &s;o far wrong your own merits, or our ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of them, as to harbour &s;uch a thought. I am extremely &s;orry for my wife's remi&s;&s;ne&s;s; but I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he depended on the intimacy between you for an excu&s;e. I hope you will have good-nature enough to forgive it, and convince us, that you do &s;o, by letting us &s;ee you &s;oon."&mdash;"Sir, an&s;wered &s;he, when your lady thinks fit to let me know that &s;he will be at home, I &s;hall wait on her."&mdash;She concluded with a curt&s;ey, and turned &s;o ha&s;tily away, that he had no opportunity of adding any thing further.</P>
<P>On his return home, he repeated what had pa&s;&s;ed to his wife; and added, that, as he found there was no pretence for breaking off the acquaintance, he would have her &s;end an invitation to her. Her complexion grew red as &s;carlet on the fir&s;t mention of Clara's name; and, when he had given over &s;peaking,&mdash;"I do not under&s;tand what &s;he means, &s;aid &s;he, by giving her&s;elf the&s;e airs; I never forbad her my hou&s;e, and, if &s;he thinks fit to &s;tay away, I have no rea&s;on to intreat her pre&s;ence; yet, &s;ince I find it will &s;o much oblige you, I &s;hall &s;end to her." &mdash;"Oblige me!" cried he in an angry tone.&mdash; "Yes! &s;ince you intere&s;t your&s;elf &s;o far in this affair." This put him beyond all patience. He told her, that &s;he behaved very ill; that &s;he di&s;co|vered
<PB N="148" REF="159">
a mean di&s;po&s;ition; and that, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in it, &s;he would render her&s;elf unworthy either of love or re&s;pect.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee, cried &s;he, that I have forfeited both with you; but it is not to my di&s;po&s;ition, it is to Clara's more prevailing charms, that I am indebted for &s;o great a misfortune.&mdash;Ungrateful, incon&s;tant man! Is this the return for all the tender affection I have had for you?"</P>
<P>Men can ill bear reproaches, e&s;pecially when in|nocent of the cau&s;e, as Dorantes really was.&mdash;He replied in the mo&s;t bitter terms, which, &s;he being unable either to endure or retort, half-&s;uffocated her with rage. She flew into the garden, and, throwing her&s;elf upon a green bank at the further end, there gave a loo&s;e to her tears and com|plainings.</P>
<P>One of the maids, happening to be at a window, &s;aw where &s;he lay, and had the di&s;cretion to run ha&s;tily down and remind her, that, &s;ome rain having lately fallen, the dampne&s;s of the earth might en|danger her health. The poor lady was as cold as marble; though the inward agitations &s;he was in, hindered her from feeling any exterior inconvenience. She ro&s;e, however, and went into her chamber, but fell into &s;uch violent agitations, as obliged her to go to bed, where &s;he continued very ill the whole night.</P>
<P>Dorantes came home very late, and, being told that his wife was indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;lept in another cham|ber.
<PB N="149" REF="160">
On hearing, in the morning, that &s;he was much wor&s;e, he &s;ent immediately for a phy&s;ician, who attended the family.</P>
<P>He found her in a fever, and delirious; all that could be done for her was in vain; her di&s;temper every hour increa&s;ed, and, in two days, her life was de&s;paired of. On the third, &s;he &s;eemed, to all appear|ance, better; the violence of her fever abated, and her &s;en&s;es were perfectly re&s;tored. Alas! the cruel di&s;ea&s;e had left the outward frame only to prey with greater force upon the nobler parts.&mdash;Death had now &s;eized her, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of it, and a&s;ked if Dorantes was at home. Being told he had lately left her chamber, &s;he de&s;ired he would come in again; which he pre&s;ently did.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner &s;eated him&s;elf on her bed&s;ide, than &s;he made a &s;ign to tho&s;e who were in the room to withdraw; and then, taking hold of his hand, &s;aid to him:&mdash;"My dear Dorantes, I feel I am no longer for this world, but cannot leave it without confe&s;&s;ing, that I have been guilty of the greate&s;t inju&s;tice to Clara. Yet was it not malice that made me &s;o: I endeavoured to make her odious in your eyes, only becau&s;e I feared &s;he had appeared too amiable.

<P>IN the commerce of life, there is a mutual con|fidence requi&s;ite, my children, between man and man. To be too credulous is a weakne&s;s, but to be too &s;u&s;picious is fordid and contemptible. If we have proved a per&s;on's fidelity in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, it would be mean and unju&s;t ever to &s;u&s;pect him, unle&s;s he obliges us to it; but if after a long intercour&s;e no cau&s;e of di&s;tru&s;t ari&s;es, but many of punctuality and &s;incerity, to doubt is then to de&s;erve treachery. When the Emperor Trajan was told that his mo&s;t dear friend Surra had formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life, he went the &s;ame evening, uninvited, at|tended only by two friends, and &s;upped with him; was &s;haved by his barber, and con&s;ulted his phy&s;i|cian.
<PB N="151" REF="162">
When he returned, he was again cautioned. Trajan &s;miled, and told them <HI>they</HI> did not know the man;&mdash;he did:&mdash;to prove that <HI>he</HI> did, he had actually put him&s;elf in Surra's power, and returned, as he knew he &s;hould, &s;afe and unhurt. Thus, in&s;tead of meanly &s;u&s;pecting the man who&s;e love and friend|&s;hip he had had &s;o many proofs of, he &s;hortly after made him Tribune; and when, according to cu&s;tom, he delivered the naked &s;word, he &s;aid, "I give you this, my friend, to defend me, if I rule well; if not, to di&s;patch me."</P>
<P>But it is not every per&s;on in whom you mu&s;t place &s;uch ab&s;olute confidence: few only are worthy of the &s;acred name of Friend, and tho&s;e few cannot be re&s;pected too highly, cannot be cheri&s;hed too inti|mately. Once well a&s;&s;ured of a friend&s;hip like this, no doubt &s;hould be made of its capability to do or &s;uffer all things. That friend, who makes a diffi|culty even of death it&s;elf in the cau&s;e of honourable friend&s;hip, is unworthy the name.</P>
<P>Eudamidas, Aretaeus, and Charixenus, were friends; the two latter were rich, the former ex|ceedingly poor. Eudamidas died, and left the fol|lowing will: "To Aretaeus I bequeath my mother, to be kept and fo&s;tered in her old age. My daughter to Charixenus, to be married, with a dowry as great as he can afford. But if, in the mean time, death &s;hould happen to either of the&s;e men, my will is, that the &s;urvivor &s;hall perform what the other &s;hould have done, had he lived." The poverty of the te&s;|tator
<PB N="152" REF="163">
was known, the duties of friend&s;hip were but little under&s;tood, and tho&s;e who heard the will of Eudamidas departed, laughing at the legacies which Aretaeus and Charixenus were to receive. But tho&s;e to whom the beque&s;ts were made, had different &s;en&s;ations; they came, acknowledged, and ratified the will. Charixenus died within five days, and Aretaeus, who had taken the mother of Eudamidas, immediately &s;ent for the daughter likewi&s;e, educated her, be&s;towed her in marriage, and of the five ta|lents which his e&s;tate amounted to, gave two to her, and two to his own daughter, and had their nuptials both celebrated in one day.</P>
<P>Such are the duties and privileges of friend&s;hip, &s;uch are the obligations you enter into, when you &s;ay to any one, I AM YOUR FRIEND.&mdash;If, therefore, you &s;hould ever ra&s;hly make &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion, and find your&s;elves unequal to the character, in&s;tantly recede; it is more honourable than to deceive: go and &s;ay to whoever your preten&s;ions may have im|po&s;ed upon, "I relea&s;e you from your obligations, and mu&s;t intreat the &s;ame of you: I feel my weak|ne&s;s, and am &s;orry to find my&s;elf unworthy to be a friend."</P>

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP: An ARABIAN ANECDOTE.</HEAD>
<P>ALI-IBN-ABBAS, favourite of the Caliph Mamoun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mamoun, &s;on of the Caliph Aroun-Alrachid. His name is famous all over the Ea&s;t; and he is reckoned the greate&s;t prince of the Abbaffidies family. He reigned twenty-eight years and eight months. He was a great warrior, of a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, and liberal to exce&s;s; but what mo&s;t immortalized him, was his love of learn|ing. He was him&s;elf deeply ver&s;ed in every &s;cience, but more e&s;pe|cially in philo&s;ophy and a&s;tronomy. This is the prince that cau&s;ed the mo&s;t valuable books to be tran&s;lated from the Greeks, their fir&s;t ma&s;ters.&mdash;The Mahometan doctors have reproached him with in|troducing philo&s;ophy, and the other &s;peculative &s;ciences, into Ma|hometani&s;m; for the Arabians of his days were not accu&s;tomed to read any other books but what related to their own religion. This prince &s;hewed equal favour to every man of knowledge, let his reli|gion be what it would.&mdash;The que&s;tion about the creation, or eter|nity, of the Alcoran, was &s;tarted in his time, and occa&s;ioned much effu&s;ion of blood. He, with the &s;malle&s;t number of doctors, held it to be created. But the other doctors in&s;i&s;ted, that the Alcoran being the word proceeding from God, was eternal like him&s;elf: this &s;entiment is embraced by the pre&s;ent Mahometans, who con&s;ider all that deny that doctrine as infidels.</NOTE>, and lieutenant of the police in the reign of this prince, relates, in the&s;e terms, a &s;tory that happened to him&s;elf. "I was one evening with the caliph, when a man, bound hand and foot, was brought in. Mamoun ordered me to keep a watch|ful eye over the pri&s;oner, and to bring him the next day. The caliph &s;eemed greatly irritated; and the
<PB N="155" REF="166">
fear of expo&s;ing my&s;elf to his re&s;entment induced me to confine the pri&s;oner in my haram, as the mo&s;t &s;ecure place in my hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked him what country he was of. He &s;aid, Dama&s;cus; and that his habitation was in the quar|ter of the great mo&s;que. May heaven, cried I, &s;hower down the choice&s;t of its ble&s;&s;ings upon the city of Dama&s;cus, and particularly upon the quar|ter where you re&s;ided! He was &s;olicitous to know the motive that &s;o much intere&s;ted me for that di&s;|trict. It is, &s;aid I, that I owe my life to a man that lived there.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e words excited his curio&s;ity, and he con|jured me to gratify it. It is many years &s;ince, con|tinued I, that the caliph, di&s;&s;atisfied with the vice|roy of Dama&s;cus, depo&s;ed him. I accompanied the per&s;on whom the prince had appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and at the in&s;tant we were taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the governor's palace, a quarrel broke out between the new and the old governor; the latter had po&s;ted &s;oldiers, who a&s;&s;aulted us: I e&s;caped out of a win|dow, and, finding my&s;elf pur&s;ued by other a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, took &s;helter in your quarter. I ob&s;erved a palace open, and &s;eeing the ma&s;ter at the door, &s;upplicated him to &s;ave my life. He immediately conducted me into the apartment of his women, where I conti|nued a month in peace and plenty.</P>
<P>"My ho&s;t came one day to inform me, that a caravan was &s;etting out for Bagdad; and that, if I wi&s;hed to return to my own home, I could not avail
<PB N="156" REF="167">
my&s;elf of a more favourable opportunity. Shame held my tongue; and I had not courage to confe&s;s my poverty; I had no money, and, for want of that, &s;hould be forced to follow the caravan on foot. But how great was my &s;urprize, when, on the day of de|parture, a very fine hor&s;e was brought me, al&s;o a mule loaded with all &s;orts of provi&s;ions, and a black &s;lave to attend me on the road! My generous ho&s;t pre&s;ent|ed me at the &s;ame time with a pur&s;e of gold, and con|ducted me him&s;elf to the caravan, where he recom|mended me to &s;everal of the travellers, who were his friends. The&s;e are the kindne&s;&s;es I received in your city, and that render it &s;o dear to me: all my concern is, that I have not hitherto been able to di&s;cover my generous benefactor. I &s;hould die con|tent, could I find an opportunity of te&s;tifying my gratitude.</P>
<P>"Your wi&s;hes are accompli&s;hed, cried my pri|&s;oner in a tran&s;port, I am he that received you in my palace. Do you not remember me? The time that had elap&s;ed &s;ince that event, and the grief into which he was &s;unk, had greatly altered his face: but, on a more clo&s;e examination of his fea|tures, I ea&s;ily recollected him; and &s;ome circum|&s;tances he brought to my mind, left me not the lea&s;t room to doubt but that the pri&s;oner, who was then in danger of lo&s;ing his life, was the very per&s;on who had &s;o generou&s;ly &s;aved mine. I embraced him with tears in my eyes, took off his chains, and a&s;ked him by what fatality he had incurred the caliph's di&s;plea|&s;ure.
<PB N="157" REF="168">
Some contemptible enemies, he replied, have found means to a&s;per&s;e me unju&s;tly to Mamoun: I was hurried away from Dama&s;cus, and cruelly de|nied even the con&s;olation of embracing my wife and children: I know not what fate attends me; but as I have rea&s;on to apprehend my death is determined, I reque&s;t you to acquaint them with my misfortunes.</P>
<P>"No, &s;aid I to him, you &s;hall not die; I dare give you this a&s;&s;urance; you &s;hall be re&s;tored to your family; be at liberty from this moment. I pre&s;ently provided &s;ome pieces of the riche&s;t gold &s;tuffs of Bagdad, and begged him to pre&s;ent them to his wife: depart immediately, added I, pre&s;ent|ing him with a pur&s;e of a thou&s;and &s;equins; ha&s;te to rejoin tho&s;e precious pledges of your affection which you left at Dama&s;cus; let the caliph's in|dignation fall on me; I dread it not, if I am happy enough to pre&s;erve you.</P>
<P>"What a propo&s;al do you make me! an&s;wered my pri&s;oner; and can you think me capable of ac|cepting it? What! &s;hall I, to avoid death, &s;acrifice that &s;ame life now, which I formerly &s;aved? Endea|vour to convince the caliph of my innocence: this is the only proof I will admit of your gratitude: if you cannot undeceive him, I will go my&s;elf and offer him my head: let him di&s;po&s;e of my life at his plea|&s;ure, provided your's be &s;afe. I again entreated him to e&s;cape, but he continued inflexible.</P>
<P>"I did not fail to pre&s;ent my&s;elf the next morn|ing before Mamoun. The prince was dre&s;&s;ed in a
<PB N="158" REF="169">
crim&s;on coloured mantle, the &s;ymbol of his anger. As &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he enquired where my pri|&s;oner was? and at the &s;ame in&s;tant ordered the executioner to attend. My lord, &s;ays I, throwing my&s;elf at his feet, &s;omething very extraordinary has happened with regard to the per&s;on you ye&s;terday committed to my cu&s;tody. Will your maje&s;ty per|mit me to explain it? The&s;e words threw him into a pa&s;&s;ion. I &s;wear, cried he, by the &s;oul of my an|ce&s;tors, that thy head &s;hall pay for the pri&s;oner, if thou ha&s;t &s;uffered him to e&s;cape. Both my life and his are at your maje&s;ty's di&s;po&s;al: vouch&s;afe to hear me. Speak, &s;aid he. I then related to the prince, in what manner that man had &s;aved my life at Da|ma&s;cus; that, de&s;irous to di&s;charge the obligation I lay under to him, I had offered him his liberty; but that he had refu&s;ed it, from the fear of expo&s;ing me to death. My lord, added I, he is not guilty; a man of &s;uch generous &s;entiments cannot be &s;o. Some ba&s;e detractors have calumniated him to you; and he is become the unfortunate victim of their ha|tred and envy. The caliph appeared affected, and having naturally a greatne&s;s of &s;oul, could not help admiring the conduct of my friend. I pardon him, &s;aid Mamoun, on thy account: go, carry him this good news, and bring him to me. I threw my&s;elf at the prince's feet, ki&s;&s;ed them, and made my ac|knowledgments in the &s;tronge&s;t terms my gratitude could &s;ugge&s;t: I then conducted my pri&s;oner into the caliph's pre&s;ence. The monarch ordered him to be
<PB N="159" REF="170">
clothed with a robe of honour, pre&s;ented him with ten hor&s;es, ten mules, and ten camels, out of his own &s;tables; to all which favours he added a pur&s;e of ten thou&s;and &s;equins for the expences of his journey, and gave him a letter of recommendation to the go|vernor of Dama&s;cus."</P>

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP AND FORGIVENESS: Or JEANOT and COLIN.</HEAD>
<P>MANY per&s;ons worthy of credit have &s;een Jeanot and Colin at &s;chool, at the town of I&s;&s;oir, in Auvergne, a place celebrated through the whole world for its college and its kettles. Jeanot was the &s;on of a hor&s;e-dealer of high renown, and Colin derived his birth from an able hu&s;bandman, who cultivated a neighbouring farm, and who, after he had paid the taxes, was not &s;uperabundantly rich at the year's end.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="171">Jeanot and Colin were comely lads for Au|vergne&s;e, and had a great friend&s;hip for each other; they had their little &s;chemes and their <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes,</HI> upon which they reflected with plea&s;ure, even when in other company.</P>
<P>The time of their being at &s;chool was nearly ex|pired, when a taylor brought Jeanot a &s;uit of figured velvet, with a letter directed to Mon&s;ieur de la Jeanotiere. Colin admired the cloaths without envy, but Jeanot a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;uperiority, which grieved him to the heart. From this moment Jea|not threw a&s;ide his book, was continually gazing in the looking-gla&s;s, and &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e the world.</P>
<P>Some time after a valet came po&s;t with another letter directed to Mon&s;ieur le Marquis de la Jano|tiere, which contained an order from Mon&s;ieur his father for his coming to Paris. Jeanot, as he got into the chai&s;e, took Colin by the hand, and gave him a &s;mile of protection with the air of a great man. Colin, touched with a &s;en&s;e of his own in|feriority, melted into tears; and Jeanot drove away in all the glory of his new dignity.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e readers who love to comprehend every thing as they go on, &s;hould be informed, that Jea|not, the father, had &s;uddenly acquired an immen&s;e fortune. If it &s;hould be a&s;ked how immen&s;e for|tunes are acquired, the an&s;wer is ready, <HI>by being fortunate.</HI> Mon&s;ieur Jeanot was a likely fellow, and madame was by no means without her charms. It happened that, whil&s;t &s;he was &s;till in her bloom,
<PB N="161" REF="172">
they were brought to Paris by a law-&s;uit, which to|tally ruined them; but Fortune, who delights in the capricious aba&s;ement and exaltation of mankind, ju&s;t then threw them in the way of a commi&s;&s;ary, who had contracted to furni&s;h the military ho&s;pi|tals during the war. This commi&s;&s;ary was a man of talents, and could boa&s;t of having killed more &s;oldiers in one year, than gun-powder had killed in ten. The wife of this extraordinary per&s;on was &s;mitten with Jeanot, whil&s;t he him&s;elf was &s;mitten with Jeanot's wife. Jeanot &s;oon came in for a &s;hare of the contract. When once a man gets into the middle of the &s;tream, the tide will carry him along; thus Commi&s;&s;aries and Contractors get im|men&s;e wealth without trouble. Such was the good fortune of Jeanot the father, who became imme|diately Mon&s;ieur de la Janotiere; and &s;oon after having bought a marqui&s;ate, which at once enno|bled him and his children, he &s;ent for the marquis his &s;on from &s;chool, that he might place him among the <HI>beau-monde</HI> of Paris.</P>
<P>Colin, who remembered his old &s;chool-fellow with a tender &s;en&s;ibility, wrote him a few lines of congratulation: the new Marquis &s;ent no an&s;wer, and Colin fell &s;ick with grief.</P>
<P>In the mean time the father and mother procured a tutor for their &s;on; this tutor was a man of a genteel appearance, but who knew little, and con|&s;equently could teach little. The father was de&s;i|rous the &s;on &s;hould learn Latin; the mother op|po&s;ed
<PB N="162" REF="173">
it. After much debate, it was agreed that the que&s;tion &s;hould be referred to a certain cele|brated author. "Sir," &s;aid the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, "as you are a Latin &s;cholar, and a man of the world"&mdash;"I a Latin &s;cholar!" &s;ays the <HI>bel e&s;prit,</HI> "I don't know a word of the language; and &s;o much the better for me; tho&s;e people certainly &s;peak their own language be&s;t, who&s;e attention is not divided among &s;everal. Con&s;ider only the la|dies, how much more plea&s;ing is their wit than ours! their letters are written with infinitely more elegance; and this &s;uperiority is entirely owing to their not having learned Latin."</P>
<P>"Very well," &s;ays madame, "am I not then in the right? I would have my &s;on a man of wit; I would have him make a figure in the world, and you &s;ee plainly that if he learn Latin he will be undone. Are operas and plays, I'd fain know, per|formed in Latin? Do the lawyers &s;peak Latin at the bar? or do young gentlemen make love in Latin?"</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de la Janotiere being wholly unable to re&s;i&s;t this amazing force of argument, immediately pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence, and it was concluded that the young Marquis &s;hould not lo&s;e his time in getting ac|quainted with Cicero, Horace, and Virgil.</P>
<P>But then what &s;hall he learn? for, certainly, he mu&s;t learn &s;omething. May he not be taught a little geography?&mdash;"Of what &s;ervice will that be," &s;ays the tutor? "When the Marquis &s;hall think
<PB N="163" REF="174">
proper to vi&s;it his e&s;tates, do you think the po&s;tilions will not know the road? take my word for it, they are in no danger of lo&s;ing their way. A man of fa&s;hion can travel very well without a quadrant, and go with great conveniency from Paris to Au|vergne, without knowing what latitude he is in."</P>
<P>"You are certainly right," &s;ays the father; "but I have heard &s;omething of a fine &s;cience, which, I think, they call A&s;tronomy."&mdash;"'Tis pity," &s;ays the tutor, "you ever heard of it all; what occa&s;ion is there for people in this world to regulate their motions by the &s;tars? Is it fit that a young Mar|quis &s;hould be fatigued to death by the calculation of an eclip&s;e, when he may find the time exactly by con&s;ulting an almanack; which will al&s;o ac|quaint him with all the moveable fea&s;ts, the age of the moon, and the age of every &s;overeign prince in Europe."</P>
<P>Madame entirely agreed; the Marquis her &s;on was overjoyed, and the father was in &s;u&s;pence. "What then, &s;ays he, mu&s;t my &s;on learn?" "To be amiable," replied the friend they had con&s;ulted, "if he knows the art of plea&s;ing, he knows all that is worth knowing; and this art he cannot fail of learning under his mother's eye, though neither &s;he nor you &s;hould give your&s;elves the lea&s;t trouble about it."</P>
<P>Madame was delighted with this compliment, and embraced the dunce who had paid it. "Ah! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover that you are wi&s;er than
<PB N="164" REF="175">
the world; my &s;on will be wholly indebted to you for his education. But, perhaps, after all, it would not be ami&s;s for him to know a little of Hi&s;tory."&mdash; Alas, madam, replied the oracle, what good can that do him? Certainly, no hi&s;tory is either u&s;eful or plea&s;ing but that of the day. All ancient hi&s;tory, as a certain author has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, is nothing more than fable artfully put together; and as for modern hi&s;tory, it is a chaos impo&s;&s;ible to be re|duced to order. Of what importance is it to your &s;on, that Charlemagne in&s;tituted the twelve peers of France? And that his &s;on had an impediment in his &s;peech? And never was ob&s;ervation more ju&s;t, than that the young mind is too often buried under a load of u&s;ele&s;s learning, by which its native powers are fir&s;t re&s;trained, and then de&s;troyed; but of all that is ab&s;urd among what are called the &s;ciences, the mo&s;t ab&s;urd is Geometry. The objects of Geometry are &s;urfaces, lines, and points, which have no exi&s;tence in nature; and a hundred curve lines are fancied Between a circle and a &s;trait line that touches it, though in reality there is not room for a &s;traw. In &s;hort, Geometry is no better than a dull joke.</P>
<P>Though Mon&s;ieur and Madame &s;carce under&s;tood one word of this ingenious argument again&s;t Geo|metry, it made a great impre&s;&s;ion, and they declared them&s;elves entirely of the tutor's mind.</P>
<P>A noble Lord, continued the Tutor, like Mon|&s;ieur le Marquis, ought not to puzzle his brain with vain &s;peculation. Should he have occa&s;ion for the
<PB N="165" REF="176">
mo&s;t &s;ublime part of this &s;cience, to lay down a plan of his e&s;tates, he may have them &s;urveyed for a little money; would he trace his nobility back to the re|mote&s;t ages, he may, without difficulty, find a Be|nedictine monk that will do it. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all the arts. A young Lord of illu&s;trious birth is neither a painter, a mu&s;ician, an architect, nor a &s;tatuary; but he makes all the&s;e arts flouri&s;h by his munificence; and it is certainly better to pa|tronize than practi&s;e them. It is enough for the Marquis to have ta&s;te; it is the duty of arti&s;ts to exert their &s;kill for his plea&s;ure and advantage; it has been well &s;aid that per&s;ons of quality, I mean tho&s;e who are very rich, know all things without learning any; their ta&s;te enables them to judge of every thing for which they can pay.</P>
<P>You have ob&s;erved, madam, &s;ays he, that the great purpo&s;e of life is to plea&s;e; but will any man pretend that this purpo&s;e can be an&s;wered by the &s;ciences? Who is there that would think of men|tioning Geometry in good company? Would any body a&s;k a gentleman what &s;tar ro&s;e in a morning with the &s;un?&mdash;Certainly not, replied the Mar|chione&s;s, who&s;e charms had introduced her to the beau monde; and it is by no means fit that my &s;on &s;hould cramp his genius by the &s;tudy of all this trumpery. But what is it that we &s;hall teach him? For certainly, as his father has ob&s;erved, a young gentleman ought to be qualified to &s;hine upon occa|&s;ion. I remember to have heard an Abb&eacute; &s;ay, that
<PB N="166" REF="177">
there was one &s;cience extremely agreeable and genteel; I cannot recollect the name of it, but it began with a B. With a B, madam? &s;ays the ge|nius, it could not be Botany!&mdash;No, replied the lady, it was not botany, yet it ended &s;omething like that too. O! I know what it was, &s;ays he, it was Bla&s;onry; but I a&s;&s;ure you it is by no means the mode. At pre&s;ent, the &s;tudy of heraldry would be infinite, for there is not a barber that has not his coat of arms; and when a thing becomes common, you know people of fa&s;hion &s;hould always di&s;regard it.&mdash;Upon the whole, this &s;agacious and illu&s;trious &s;ociety having fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all the &s;ciences, it was determined that Mon&s;ieur le Marquis de la Janotiere &s;hould learn to <HI>dance.</HI></P>
<P>Nature, however, which indeed does every thing, had given this flower of nobility a talent which very &s;oon di&s;played it&s;elf with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s. This <HI>happy</HI> talent was that of <HI>&s;inging a good &s;ong,</HI> the graces of youth, joined to &s;o <HI>&s;uperior</HI> an endowment, drew attention, and he was a favourite among the ladies. Having his head full of &s;ongs, he formed new ones out of old, and was continually repeating them; but as his ver&s;es had commonly a foot too little, or too much, he was at the expence of having them cor|rected; and he at la&s;t got into the literary annals of the time.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s con&s;idering her&s;elf as the pa|trone&s;s of wit, gave &s;uppers to the wits of the town; the young man's head was turned; he acquired the
<PB N="167" REF="178">
art of &s;peaking without knowing what he would &s;ay, and by habit became perfect in being fit for nothing.</P>
<P>When his father found him thus amazingly <HI>elo|quent,</HI> he very much regretted that he had not taught him Latin, as he then might have purcha&s;ed for him a con&s;iderable department in the law. His mother, who looked &s;till higher, undertook to get him a regiment, and in the mean time the young gentle|man him&s;elf thought fit to make love.</P>
<P>Love &s;ometimes co&s;ts more than a regiment; his expences were very great; and his parents run out their fortune by living like people of the fir&s;t qua|lity.</P>
<P>But as the &s;tate of their finances was known only to them&s;elves, a young widow of great rank, but &s;mall fortune, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be very opulent, re&s;olved to &s;ecure their riches, by making the young Marquis her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>She accordingly threw out a lure, and brought him to her hou&s;e; &s;he convinced him that he was by no means indifferent to her; led him on by de|grees; and at length &s;o fa&s;cinated him by her wiles and her charms, that the conque&s;t was compleat. At the &s;ame time &s;he gave him &s;o many commenda|tions, and &s;o much good advice, that the father and mother con&s;idered her as the be&s;t friend they had in the world.</P>
<P>An old lady in the neighbourhood propo&s;ed the marriage on the part of the widow&punc; and the father
<PB N="168" REF="179">
and mother, dazzled with the &s;plendor of &s;uch an alliance, accepted the propo&s;ition with joy.</P>
<P>He was kneeling one morning at the feet of the dear angel, when a &s;ervant of the Marchione&s;s his mother arrived in great ha&s;te, and with looks as wild as if he had &s;een an apparition: I am come, &s;ays he, with news very different from what you think of; the Sheriff's officers are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Lord's hou&s;e, they have &s;eized his goods, talk of &s;ecuring his per&s;on, and, as I have not a moment to lo&s;e, I am going to &s;ecure my wages.</P>
<P>Don't be in &s;uch a hurry, &s;ays the Marquis, let us &s;ee a little into this affair.&mdash;Do, &s;ays the widow, run this in&s;tant, and puni&s;h the wretches for their in&s;olence.</P>
<P>He ha&s;ted, and found that his father was already carried to pri&s;on, and the &s;ervants were gone off, each having carried away what he could lay his hands upon. He &s;aw his mother totally de&s;erted, without &s;uccour and without comfort, drowned in tears, with nothing left but the remembrance of her fortune, her beauty, her follies, and her faults.</P>
<P>After her &s;on had wept with her till the tumult of his mind a little &s;ub&s;ided, and he was able to &s;peak, he endeavoured to alleviate her di&s;tre&s;s by a reflection that had &s;oothed his own. Do not let us de&s;pair, &s;ays he, the widow whom I was about to marry, is yet more generous than rich; I will an&s;wer for all that is in her power; I'll fly to her this moment, and bring her hither.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="180">He flew to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ound her <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> with a hand&s;ome young officer.&mdash;What is it you, Mon&s;ieur de la Janotiere?&mdash;&s;ays &s;he&mdash;what in the name of wonder have you to do here? How could you think of leaving your poor mother? Go back to her, for heaven's &s;ake, and tell her how &s;orry I am for her misfortune. I always wi&s;hed her well; and as my woman is going away, I &s;hall not think of another till I have given her the refu&s;al or the place.&mdash;My good lad, &s;aid the officer, you &s;eem to be well made; if you will enter Into my corps, I will enli&s;t you upon good terms.</P>
<P>The Marquis, &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s with rage and in|dignation, bur&s;t away without reply, to his old tutor, to pour his &s;orrows into his bo&s;om, and derive com|fort from his advice. The tutor propo&s;ed that he &s;hould undertake the education of children. Alas, &s;ays the Marquis, I know nothing &mdash; you have taught me nothing&mdash;and that has been the &s;ource of all my misfortunes.&mdash;Write novels, &s;ays another; it is an excellent expedient to get money.</P>
<P>Sunk deeper in de&s;pair than ever, his la&s;t re&s;ource was to a monk who had been his mother's confe&s;&s;or. The Monk ran to him in a rapture of &s;urprize and joy; Mon&s;ieur le Marquis! what do you do here on foot? where is your coach? The unhappy youth replied by giving him an account of the ruin of his family. The Monk became grave, indifferent, and important: my &s;on, &s;aid he, we may now &s;ee plainly what heaven intended for you; riches &s;erve only to
<PB N="170" REF="181">
corrupt the heart: heaven has therefore reduced you to beggary; my &s;on, <HI>adieu!</HI> a lady of fa&s;hion is now waiting for me at court.</P>
<P>The poor Marquis, as he &s;tood ruminating in the &s;treet, &s;tupified with misfortune, &s;aw a kind of cover|ed carriage coming rumbling along, followed by wag|gons heavily laden. In this vehicle &s;at a young man, coar&s;ely clad, with a fre&s;h coloured girl by his &s;ide. Ble&s;s my &s;oul, &s;ays he, &s;urely this is Jeanot! The Marquis &s;tarted, looked up, and the driver in&s;tantly &s;topped. Yes, by my faith, &s;aid he, it is even Jeanot him&s;elf; and in&s;tantly caught him in his arms. Jeanot was covered with confu&s;ion and tears. You have for&s;aken me, &s;ays Colin, but I am determined to love you for all that. Jeanot told him a part of his hi&s;tory. Come home with me, &s;aid Colin, you &s;hall tell the re&s;t at your lei&s;ure; &s;alute my little wife; this is &s;he; let us make ha&s;te to dinner.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;ays Jeanot, what is all this baggage; does it belong to you? Yes, &s;ays Colin, to me and my wife, we are ju&s;t come out of the country; I am at the head of a great manufactory; I married the daughter of a man who had acquired very con&s;ider|able &s;ub&s;tance; we work hard, providence has ble&s;&s;ed our endeavours, we continue to get forward in the world, are happy in our&s;elves, and have it in our power to a&s;&s;i&s;t our friend Jeanot. Be a Marquis no longer; all the great folks in the world are not worth one true friend: you &s;hall live with me in the country, you &s;hall learn my trade, and be my part|ner,
<PB N="117" REF="182" MS="y">
and we will live chearfully in the ob&s;cure but happy retreat where we were born.</P>
<P>Jeanot heard this propo&s;al with &s;en&s;ations not to be de&s;cribed; his heart was divided between grief and joy, tenderne&s;s and &s;hame; and, turning to Colin, he &s;aid, in a low voice, "when all my gay friends have de&s;erted me, Colin, whom I injuriou&s;ly neglected, has afforded me that comfort which I did not de&s;erve."</P>
<P>What a lecture is this for tho&s;e who are entering into life? The virtue of Colin, called out that virtue which lay hidden in the brea&s;t of Jeanot, and which all his habits of folly and di&s;&s;ipation had not de&s;troyed. He felt a &s;ecret repugnance to de&s;ert his father and mother. We will take care of them, &s;ays Colin. Jeanot at length married Colin's &s;i&s;ter, who made him happy; and Jeanot the father, and Jeanot the mother, and Jeanot the &s;on, were made &s;en&s;ible that happine&s;s is not to be found in vanity.</P>

<P>A CERTAIN hone&s;t pea&s;ant was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine watchful hou&s;e-dog; a friend to his &s;er|vants, no enemy to his gue&s;ts, and the terror of thieves. His fidelity was &s;o well known in the neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="172" REF="183">
that, after a few &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s attempts, not a &s;ingle rogue had, for many years, dared to come within the &s;phere of this excellent centinel.</P>
<P>One evening, as the good man and his wife &s;at round the fire, talking of their oeconomy, "I have been thinking, wife, &s;ays the farmer, that this great dog of our's is an u&s;ele&s;s expence to us: he takes a deal of keeping, his collars and chains co&s;t money, we &s;hall &s;oon be obliged to build him a new kennel, our brooms are worn out in keeping him clean, be&s;ide many a tru&s;s of &s;traw that &s;erves for his bed; and all this in a place where, for many years pa&s;t, we have neither heard of murder nor theft." "I have long thought of the &s;ame thing, replied the wife; our girls have other bu&s;ine&s;s than to wait on an idle creature; be&s;ides, here is my little favourite can bark as loud as the large&s;t ma&s;tiff."</P>
<P>Sentence was quickly pa&s;&s;ed, and the faithful cen|tinel was put to death; but he was &s;carce covered with earth, before a band of thieves were gathered to con&s;ult on the be&s;t means to execute their de&s;ign. Night came on; they broke into the hou&s;e, and while the pampered favourite &s;lept upon his cu&s;hion, rob|bed the farmer of all his money and furniture.</P>
<P>I have no doubt, my children, you all under&s;tand the moral of this fable, and that you think the pea&s;ant and his wife de&s;erved their puni&s;hment. Ingratitude is a vice which, like lying, every body is a&s;hamed of, and yet almo&s;t every body practi&s;es. The fact is, people deceive them&s;elves in &s;umming up the
<PB N="173" REF="184">
account of reciprocal obligation; they omit &s;o many particulars which they ought punctually to remem|ber, and in&s;ert &s;o many which it becomes them to forget, that the ballance is but too generally er|roneous. It is our duty to be equally exact in debts of gratitude as in tho&s;e of trade; nay more &s;o, for an omi&s;&s;ion of pecuniary commerce may &s;ome|times be honourably accommodated, but the &s;in of ingratitude can never be expiated.</P>
<P>Philip of Macedon &s;ent one of his courtiers on a voyage to tran&s;act an affair of &s;ome con&s;equence, but a &s;torm coming on, the courtier was &s;hip|wrecked, and mu&s;t indubitably have peri&s;hed, had it not been for the ho&s;pitality of a pea&s;ant who lived on the &s;ea-&s;hore, and who ventured his own life in a &s;mall boat, to pre&s;erve that of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tranger. By this pea&s;ant the courtier was taken up, brought to his own hou&s;e, recovered, and treated with the utmo&s;t humanity; and after &s;taying with him a month, kindly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and furni&s;hed with money to bear his expences. At his return, the King was made acquainted with the peril he had been in, and the di&s;tre&s;s he had undergone, but not with the benefits he had received. Philip, moved with the &s;tory, told him he would remember his fidelity, and the dangers he had &s;uffered for his &s;ake. The courtier taking advantage of the King's promi&s;e, told him he had ob&s;erved a beautiful little farm on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, that exactly &s;uited his ta&s;te, on the very &s;pot where he had been wrecked, and be&s;ought him to be&s;tow it on him
<PB N="174" REF="185">
as a monument of his e&s;cape, and his Maje&s;ty's bounty. Accordingly Philip wrote to Pau&s;anias, the governor of the province, to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de&s;ired farm. The poor pea&s;ant, who had &s;o generou&s;ly &s;aved the life of this wretch, being rob|bed of his right, and &s;tung with the ingratitude of of the act, immediately made a journey to the court of Philip, applied him&s;elf to the King, and related his &s;tory. Philip amazed and enraged at the ingra|titude of his villainous courtier, had him &s;eized in|&s;tantly, and marked him in the forehead with the&s;e words, The UNGRATEFUL GUEST, and re&s;tored the farm to its proper owner.</P>

<HEAD>INGRATITUDE, Or the CANDLESTICK.</HEAD>
<P>A Dervi&s;e, venerable by his age, fell ill in the hou&s;e of a woman who had been long a widow, and lived in extreme poverty in the &s;uburbs of Bal&s;ora. He was &s;o touched with the a&s;&s;iduity and zeal with which &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, that at his departure he &s;aid, "I have remarked that you have wherewith to &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, but that you have not &s;ufficient to &s;hare with your only &s;on, the young Abdallah. If you will tru&s;t him to me, I will endeavour to ac|knowledge, in his per&s;on, the obligations I am under for your great care of me." The widow received his propo&s;al with joy; and the Dervi&s;e departed with the young man, informing her, that they &s;hould perform a journey which would la&s;t near two years. They travelled; the Dervi&s;e kept him in affluence, gave him excellent in&s;tructions, cured him of a dan|gerous di&s;ea&s;e with which he had been attacked; in fine, he took the &s;ame care of him, as if he had been his own &s;on. Abdallah, a hundred times te&s;tified his gratitude for all his bounties; but the old man always an&s;wered, "my &s;on, it is by actions that gratitude is proved; we &s;hall &s;ee in proper time and place, whether you are as grateful as you profe&s;s to be."</P>
<P>One day, in a &s;olitary place, the Dervi&s;e &s;aid to Abdallah, "My &s;on, we are now at the end of our
<PB N="176" REF="187">
journey; I &s;hall employ my prayers to obtain from heaven, that the earth may open and make an en|trance wide enough to permit thee to de&s;cend into a place, where thou wilt find one of the greate&s;t trea&s;ures that the earth inclo&s;es in her bowels. Ha&s;t thou courage to de&s;cend into this &s;ubterraneous cave?" Abdallah declared he might depend upon his obedience and zeal. The Dervi&s;e then lighted a &s;mall fire, into which he ca&s;t a per&s;ume; then read and prayed for &s;ome moments, when the earth opened:&mdash;"Thou maye&s;t now enter, my dear Ab|dallah. Remember, &s;aid the Dervi&s;e, that it is in thy power to do me a great &s;ervice, and that this is, perhaps, the only opportunity thou can&s;t ever have of te&s;tifying thy gratitude. Be not dazzled by the riches thou wilt find there; but think only of &s;eizing upon an iron candle&s;tick with twelve branches, which thou wilt find clo&s;e to a door, and which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to me; bring it up to me im|mediately." Abdallah promi&s;ed, and de&s;cended boldly into the cave. But forgetting what had been expre&s;sly recommended to him, whil&s;t he was filling his ve&s;t and his bo&s;om with gold and jewels, the open|ing by which he entered, clo&s;ed. He had, how|ever, pre&s;ence of mind enough to &s;eize upon the iron candle&s;tick, and though his &s;ituation was very terrible, he did not abandon him&s;elf to de&s;pair, but reflected in what manner he &s;hould get out of a place which might become his grave. Apprehending that the cave had clo&s;ed becau&s;e he had not followed the
<PB N="177" REF="188">
order of the Dervi&s;e, he recalled to memory the care and goodne&s;s he had been loaded with, re|proached him&s;elf with his ingratitude, and fini&s;hed his meditation by humbling him&s;elf in prayer. At length, after much inquietude and pain, he was for|tunate enough to find a narrow pa&s;&s;age which di|rected him out; though it was not till he had per|&s;evered for a con&s;iderable way, that he perceived a &s;mall opening covered with briars and thorns, through which he returned to the light of the &s;un. He looked on all &s;ides to di&s;cover the Dervi&s;e, but in vain. He wi&s;hed to deliver him the iron candle&s;tick, and formed a de&s;ign of quitting him, being rich enough with what he had taken out of the cavern, to live in affluence without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Not perceiving the Dervi&s;e, nor remembering any of the places through which he had pa&s;&s;ed, he went on as fortune &s;eemed to direct, and was &s;oon extremely a&s;toni&s;hed to find him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to his mother's hou&s;e, from which he imagined he was at a great di&s;tance. She immediately enquired after the holy Dervi&s;e. Abdallah told her frankly what had hap|pened to him, and the danger he had ran to &s;atisfy his ambitious de&s;ires, He afterwards produced to her the riches with which he was loaded. His mother concluded, upon the &s;ight of them, that the Dervi&s;e de&s;igned only to make trial of his courage and obedience; and that they had a right to the happine&s;s which fortune had poured upon them. Doubtle&s;s, added &s;he, &s;uch was the intention of the
<PB N="178" REF="189">
holy Dervi&s;e. Whil&s;t, with avidity, they con|templated upon the&s;e trea&s;ures, whil&s;t dazzled with their lu&s;tre, and forming a thou&s;and projects, they va|ni&s;hed from before their eyes. Then it was that Abdallah mo&s;t &s;incerely reproached him&s;elf with in|gratitude and di&s;obedience; and, ob&s;erving that the iron candle&s;tick had re&s;i&s;ted the enchantment, or rather that the puni&s;hment is ju&s;t which tho&s;e de&s;erve who do not execute what they promi&s;e, he &s;aid, pro&s;trating him&s;elf,&mdash;"What I de&s;erve has happened to me; I have lo&s;t what I had de&s;igned to keep, and the candle&s;tick which I intended to deliver up, re|mains with me: it is a proof, that this rightly be|longs to him, and that the re&s;t was unju&s;tly acquired." He fini&s;hed with the&s;e words, and placed the candle|&s;tick in the mid&s;t of their little hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When night came on, without reflecting upon it, he placed a light in this candle&s;tick. Immediately they &s;aw a Dervi&s;e, who turned round for an hour, and di&s;appeared, after having thrown them an a&s;per<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall &s;ilver coin.</NOTE>. This candle&s;tick had twelve branches: Abdallah, who had been now meditating all day upon what he had &s;een in the night, was willing to know what would happen the next night, if he &s;hould put a light into each branch; he did &s;o, and twelve dervi&s;es appeared at the in&s;tant. The&s;e turned round al&s;o for an hour, and each of them threw an a&s;per, as they di&s;appeared. He repeated every night the &s;ame ceremony; which had always
<PB N="179" REF="190">
the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s; but he never could make it &s;uc|ceed more than once in twenty-four hours. So trifling a &s;um was enough for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: there was a time when they would not have de&s;ired more to be made happy; but it was not con&s;iderable enough to change their fortune.&mdash;It is dangerous for the ima|gination to be fixed upon the idea of riches. The &s;ight of what he flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the projects he had formed, had left &s;uch pro|found traces in his mind, as nothing could efface. Reflecting on the &s;mall advantage he drew from the candle&s;tick, he re&s;olved to carry it back to the Der|vi&s;e, in hopes that he might obtain of him the trea|&s;ure he had &s;een, or at lea&s;t recover the riches which had vani&s;hed, by re&s;toring to him what he had te&s;ti|fied &s;o earne&s;t a de&s;ire for. Remembering his name, and that of the city where he inhabited, he departed immediately for Magrebi, carrying with him the candle&s;tick; taking care to light it every night, as by that means he was furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries on the road, without being obliged to implore the com|pa&s;&s;ion of the faithful. When he arrived at Magrebi, his fir&s;t care was to enquire at what hou&s;e, or in what convent Abounadar lodged. Every body was able to tell him his habitation. He repaired thither directly, and found fifty porters at his gate, each with a golden-headed &s;taff in his hands. The court of his palace was filled with dome&s;tics and &s;laves; in fine, no re&s;idence of a Prince could expo&s;e to view greater magnificence. Abdallah, &s;truck with
<PB N="180" REF="191">
a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration, feared to proceed. Certainly, thought he, I either explained my&s;elf wrong, or tho&s;e to whom I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf de|&s;igned to make a je&s;t of me, becau&s;e I am a &s;tranger. This the habitation of a Dervi&s;e! It is that of a King! In this embarra&s;&s;ment a per&s;on approached him, and &s;aid, Abdallah, <HI>thou art welcome; my ma&s;ter,</HI> Abounadar, <HI>has long expected thee.</HI> He was then conducted to a magnificent pavilion, where the Dervi&s;e was &s;eated. Abdallah, &s;truck with the &s;plendor which he beheld on all &s;ides, would have pro&s;trated him&s;elf at his feet, but Abounadar pre|vented him; and, when he would have made a merit of re&s;toring the candle&s;tick, "Thou art ungrateful, &s;aid he; do&s;t thou imagine that I am to be impo&s;ed on? I am not ignorant of thy thoughts. Had&s;t thou known the value of this candle&s;tick, never would&s;t thou have brought it to me! I &s;hall make thee &s;en&s;ible of its true u&s;e." Immediately he placed a light in each of its branches; and when the twelve dervi&s;es had turned round for &s;ome time, gave each of them a touch with a cane, and in a moment they were converted into twelve heaps of &s;equins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Turki&s;h gold coin.</NOTE>, dia|monds, and other precious &s;tones. "This, &s;aid he, is the proper u&s;e to be made of this marvellous candle&s;tick. As to me, I never de&s;ired it, but as a curio&s;ity in my cabinet; as a tali&s;man compo&s;ed by a Sage whom I revere; and I am plea&s;ed to expo&s;e it &s;ometimes to tho&s;e who come to vi&s;it me. To prove
<PB N="181" REF="192">
to thee that curio&s;ity was the motive of my &s;earch for it, here are the keys of my magazines, open them, and judge of my trea&s;ures; tell me if the mo&s;t in&s;atiable mi&s;er would not be &s;atisfied with them." Abdallah obeyed him; he examined twelve magazines of great extent, and they produced new de&s;ires. The regret of having re&s;tored the candle|&s;tick, without finding out the u&s;e of it, pierced the heart of Abdallah. Abounadar &s;eemed not to per|ceive it; loaded him with care&s;&s;es, kept him &s;ome days in his hou&s;e, and commanded that he &s;hould be treated as him&s;elf. At the eve of the day which he had fixed for his departure, he &s;aid to him, "Ab|dallah, my &s;on, I believe, by what has happened to thee, thou art cured of the frightful vice of in|gratitude; however, I owe thee a mark of my af|fection, for having undertaken &s;o long a journey, with a view of bringing me what I de&s;ired; thou maye&s;t depart, I &s;hall detain thee no longer. To|morrow, at the gate of my palace, thou &s;halt find one of my hor&s;es to carry thee; I make thee a pre|&s;ent of it, as well as of a &s;lave who &s;hall conduct thee home; and two camels loaded with &s;uch gold and jewels, as thou &s;halt chu&s;e for thy&s;elf out of my trea&s;ures." Abdallah an&s;wered with all that an avaritious heart could expre&s;s, when its pa&s;&s;ion was &s;atisfied; and retired to re&s;t till the morning arrived, which was fixed for his departure.</P>
<P>During the night he was &s;till agitated, without being able to think of any thing but the candle&s;tick,
<PB N="182" REF="193">
and what it had produced. "I had it, &s;aid he, long in my power; Abounadar, without me, had never been the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it. What ri&s;ks did I not run in the &s;ubterraneous vault? Why does he now po&s;&s;e&s;s this trea&s;ure of trea&s;ures? Becau&s;e I had the probity, or rather the folly, to bring it back to him. He profits by my labours, and the danger I have in|curred in &s;o long a journey. And what does he give me in return? Two camels loaded with gold and jewels; in one moment the candle&s;tick will furni&s;h him with ten times as much. It is Abou|nadar who is ungrateful: What injury &s;hall I do him in taking away this candle&s;tick? None certainly; he is rich: and what are my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions?" Such ideas determined him, at length, to make every po&s;&s;ible attempt to &s;eize upon the candle&s;tick. It was not difficult, for Abounadar had tru&s;ted him with the keys of his magazines. He knew where the candle&s;tick was placed. He &s;eized upon it, hid it in the bottom of one of the &s;acks, which he filled with the gold and other trea&s;ure he was allowed to take, and &s;ecured that, as well as the re&s;t, upon one of his camels. He had no other anxiety now than for his departure; and after having ha&s;tily bid adieu to the generous Abounadar, delivered him his keys, and departed with the hor&s;e, the &s;lave, and the two camels.</P>
<P>When he was at &s;ome di&s;tance from Bal&s;ora, he &s;old his &s;lave, re&s;olving not to retain the witne&s;s of his former poverty, nor of the &s;ource of his pre&s;ent
<PB N="183" REF="194">
riches. He bought another, and arrived without ob&s;tacle at his mother's. His fir&s;t care was to place the lading of his camels and the candle&s;tick in the mo&s;t private room of the hou&s;e; and, in the impa|tience to feed his eyes with &s;uch opulence, he placed lights immediately in the candle&s;tick: the twelve dervi&s;es appearing, he &s;truck each of them with a cane with all his &s;trength, le&s;t he &s;hould be failing in the laws of the tali&s;man: but he had not remarked, that Abounadar, when he &s;truck them, had the cane in his left-hand. Abdallah, by a natural motion, made u&s;e of his right hand; and the dervi&s;es, in&s;tead of becoming heaps of riches, immediately drew each from beneath his robes a formidable club, with which they &s;truck him repeatedly, and leaving him half dead, di&s;appeared with all his trea&s;ure, camels, hor&s;e, &s;lave, and the candle&s;tick.</P>
<P>Thus was Abdallah puni&s;hed for unrea&s;onable ambition, which perhaps might have been pardon|able, if it had not been accompanied by an ingra|titude as wicked as it was audacious.</P>

<HEAD>GRATITUDE: Or the Story of PIETRO CORNARO, and the grateful TURK.</HEAD>
<P>SIGNIOR Pietro Cornaro, an accompli&s;hed young gentleman of an ancient family, and of con|&s;iderable fortune in the city of Ferrara in Italy, was induced to travel through the provinces of his cele|brated country, that he might &s;atisfy curio&s;ity, and enrich his mind with &s;uch acquirements, as would di&s;tingui&s;h him, and his acqui&s;itions, from per&s;ons le&s;s qualified and le&s;s ambitious of true renown. He arrived at Leghorn, and took up lodgings at an inn. Happening to be placed in an apartment that opened to the public &s;treet, he would often walk about his room, and by looking frequently upon the &s;treet, divert him&s;elf agreeably with curious ob&s;ervations on whatever pa&s;&s;ed before him. It is a cu&s;tom of this town to give leave to the Turks, who &s;erve them as &s;laves, to ply as porters, or betake them|&s;elves to any other drudgery, obliging them to pay their ma&s;ters a certain proportion of what they earn, and permitting them to keep the overplus for their own nece&s;&s;ities. Directly oppo&s;ite to Cornaro's chamber was a bench, on which he often ob&s;erved a Turki&s;h &s;lave, thoughtful and dejected, leaning pen|&s;ively his head upon his hand, and dropping now and
<PB N="185" REF="196">
then a &s;ilent tear, which he endeavoured &s;ecretly to wipe away with his knot of ropes, the wretched badge of his unfortunate employment. The frequent re|petition of this mournful practice &s;truck the com|pa&s;&s;ionate Italian; who, earne&s;tly de&s;irous to become acquainted with the rea&s;on of his &s;orrow, &s;ent at la&s;t a me&s;&s;enger to bring him to his apartment; and proceeded to demand the manner of his being taken, and how long he had continued in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. With wringing hands and elevated eyes, which &s;eemed to blame his &s;tars for his unpitied mi&s;ery, the di&s;con&s;olate Mahometan began his tale; and watered his complaints with &s;howers of tears. "I am, &s;ays he, an hone&s;t Mu&s;&s;ulman, neither the friend of war or rapine, but become a prey to both. In an unlucky vi&s;it made to &s;ee an aged father, then in health and peace at Cyprus, now perhaps laid cold and breathle&s;s, was I taken by the Chri&s;tians, made a &s;lave, and reduced to what you now behold."</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ad complaints were followed by a &s;incere and full account of every accident which had con|curred to reduce him to this &s;lavery. He informed his kind enquirer, that he had &s;orrowfully &s;pent four tedious years in that condition, and had left three wives, two &s;ons, now men, and nine &s;mall children, to deplore his lo&s;s; who were wholly de&s;titute of the means whereby to know his pre&s;ent condition. The pitying brea&s;t of Signior Pietro, framed for tender and compa&s;&s;ionate emotions, melted generou&s;ly with &s;ympathetic di&s;tre&s;s, to find the wretched and forlorn
<PB N="186" REF="197">
&s;ituation of this complaining Mu&s;&s;ulman; and after a&s;king his name, and other que&s;tions, gave him mo|ney, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, bidding him hope for &s;uccour.</P>
<P>The di&s;con&s;olate Turk returned to the unwelcome practice of his daily labours. The benevolent Pietro &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting on this unfortunate man's &s;orrow, and con&s;idering that the will of Providence, or &s;ome un&s;u&s;pected turn of fortune, might one day make the ca&s;e his own, might teach him, by the bitter proof of &s;ad experience, how to pity others' mi&s;eries, re&s;olved to do a noble act of Chri&s;tian charity; and making intere&s;t with the governor, found means to get the Turk relea&s;ed, for the ran&s;om of about one hundred and forty-five ducats. Never could more welcome and &s;urpri&s;ing news rejoice the gladdened heart of a human &s;ufferer, than that which brought the hap|py Turk the news of his delivery. With rapid tran&s;ports of ungoverned joy, he fell upon his knees, embraced the feet of his adored redeemer, and with numerous vows of heart-felt gratitude, entreated Signior Pietro to inform him how he might return, twofold, that friendly &s;um, which had &s;o effectually purcha&s;ed his liberty. The generous Italian told him he expected no return; yet if his &s;oul was no|ble, and would urge him to be grateful, he a&s;ked only the &s;olemn promi&s;e, that he would, when ar|rived in Turkey, redeem from &s;lavery &s;ome Chri&s;|tian, whom he might think de&s;erving of it, and &s;end him back, to vi&s;it once again his native coun|try. The redeemed Turk, &s;upplied with cloaths
<PB N="187" REF="198">
and all things nece&s;&s;ary, embarked on board an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el bound for A&s;ia, and returned to his habitation. About three months after the Maho|metan's departure from Leghorn, Signior Pietro, having been the greate&s;t part of that time at Ve|nice, became enamoured of a beautiful young lady, called Maria Margarita Delfino, who had for &s;everal years re&s;ided in that town, under the care of a &s;ub|&s;tantial merchant, younge&s;t brother to her father, who with her &s;i&s;ters, and the major part of her re|lations, lived at Malta. Nothing could per&s;uade the amorous Italian from a violent expre&s;&s;ion of his growing pa&s;&s;ion; he &s;olicited her uncle with ince&s;|&s;ant importunities, and at la&s;t engaged him to per|mit him to addre&s;s her upon this condition, that he &s;hould accompany his niece and him to Malta, there to obtain her father's approbation of his per&s;on and condition. This was promi&s;ed, and he continued four months, daily vi&s;iting the object of his affection, till he gained entirely her con&s;ent to marry him, when &s;he &s;hould be authori&s;ed by her father's or|ders. They embarked on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for Malta, and belonging to that i&s;land, which they were almo&s;t arrived in &s;ight of, when a Turki&s;h galley met them, made undi&s;tingui&s;hed prize of all her cargo, and con&s;igning Signior Pietro, with his mi&s;tre&s;s and her uncle to &s;lavery, landed them at Smyrna, together with the valuable prize in which they were taken. I forgot to mention, that the three companions in this mi&s;erable &s;tate had changed
<PB N="188" REF="199">
their cloaths for coar&s;e and rougher habits, when they &s;aw the danger they were falling into; that, being &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, they might expect a ran&s;om at a &s;maller charge, than otherwi&s;e would &s;erve; &s;o that being taken with the common people, they were like them, in chains, conducted to the public market, where &s;laves are bought and &s;old as &s;heep or oxen. Signior Pietro and the young lady's uncle were tied together, and placed, with many more, to wait the purcha&s;e of the highe&s;t bidder. Oppo&s;ite to them the poor unhappy lady &s;tood, half dead with fear and angui&s;h, with a numerous crowd of Chri&s;tian women, young and old, expecting every moment to be bought, and torn away from any hopes of ever &s;eeing her lover and relations. At la&s;t a young and graceful Turk came up to the di&s;|con&s;olate Maria, and bargaining immediately with the proper officer, paid the money; then throw|ing over her a veil he had brought on purpo&s;e, took her from the re&s;t, and carried her away with an uncommon &s;atisfaction. Many a complaining look did the de&s;pairing lady give her friends, who an&s;wered her with all the mournful marks of &s;ilent lamentation, and were now (e&s;pecially the lover) &s;o confounded with their mi&s;ery, that they &s;tood like &s;tatues, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly on the ground, tak|ing little notice of the many purcha&s;ers, who walked about from place to place to view the per|&s;ons of the wretched captives.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="200">While they &s;tood thus fixed in contemplation on the tran&s;itory ble&s;&s;ings of this mortal life, there came a Turk from &s;tall to &s;tall, enquiring earne&s;t|ly of every officer what quality and country their &s;laves were of; and examining particularly the &s;laves them&s;elves, he at la&s;t came to Signior Pietro, who hanging down his head, the Turk &s;tooped forward to look upon his face; a courte&s;y not often practi&s;ed by tho&s;e barbarous people, who, when a &s;lave refu&s;es to hold up his face, will gene|rally take them roughly by the chin, as when a jockey looks into a hor&s;e's mouth. The Turk no &s;ooner &s;aw the face, but &s;tarting back in great &s;ur|pri&s;e, he rai&s;ed his arms and eyes towards heaven, and tran&s;ported at the &s;trange di&s;covery, cried out aloud, "I thank thee, holy prophet, thou ha&s;t guided well my lucky foot&s;teps." The grieved Italian looking up at this &s;urpri&s;ing exclamation, &s;aw before his eyes the very man whom, in Leghorn, he had &s;o kindly freed from &s;lavery. No pen can de&s;cribe the raptures he conceived at this happy meeting; &s;wift embraces followed their &s;urpri&s;e, and when the wonder of the Turk gave him leave to &s;peak again, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Signior Pietro: "I promi&s;ed thee, &s;aid he, thou be&s;t of Chri&s;tians, that I would certainly redeem from &s;ervitude &s;uch &s;lave as I &s;hould judge &s;hould more than any el&s;e de|&s;erve that ble&s;&s;ing; and now, thanks to Mahomet! in thee have I di&s;covered him." In&s;tantly he or|dered the officer who guarded him to &s;end &s;ome
<PB N="190" REF="201">
per&s;on for his ran&s;om, and to conduct him directly to his own hou&s;e. The overjoyed Italian heard with plea&s;ure the return of his gratitude; but told him, "If he would be doubly kind, he might redeem his friend who &s;uffered with him, and they would find &s;ome &s;peedy means to reimbur&s;e his charges." The propo&s;ition was embraced as &s;oon as offered, and a per&s;on being &s;ent to take the money, received immediately the ran&s;om he demanded, and return|ing to market, left the gentlemen to the care of their redeemer. The Turk's two &s;ons, when told of the accident by which their father met the man to whom he owed his liberty, expre&s;&s;ed &s;incere and grateful joy, and bid them welcome with inexpre&s;&s;ible civi|lity. After having heard the manner of their being taken, and their &s;orrowful complaint for the lo&s;s of an unhappy virgin, whom they &s;o ardently loved, the elde&s;t of the two &s;ons cried out with earne&s;tne&s;s, "Now, by the religion of our holy prophet, and his people, my father's hou&s;e contains this very virgin!" He proceeded to inform them, that he had bought that morning a young Chri&s;tian &s;lave, to wait upon his mother and his father's other wives; that &s;he had given the &s;ame account as they had done of the particulars of her captivity; that &s;he was then above, among the women, and he would, for &s;atisfaction, fetch her down that very moment. It is ea&s;y to imagine the di&s;order of their bo&s;oms, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed alternately by hope and fear, till doubt gave way to certainty, and
<PB N="191" REF="202">
they beheld the per&s;on they had &s;o lately lo&s;t, con|ducted to their arms by him to whom the laws of Turkey gave her as a lawful purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>They &s;taid a week with their landlord, who would not re&s;t till he had ran&s;omed two men &s;ervants, and a maid who waited on the lady: the&s;e, together with as many of the goods and cloaths as he could purcha&s;e from the Turk who took them, he be&s;tow|ed again on their lawful owners, gave them a con|&s;iderable &s;um of money, and contrived to get them a pa&s;&s;age on board a ve&s;&s;el of Mar&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iller, then bound to Malta. Signior Pietro, the young lady, and her uncle, frequently endeavoured to oblige this ho|ne&s;t Turk to take their bills, or find &s;ome other method to &s;ecure his money, but he per&s;i&s;ted in a po&s;itive refu&s;al of all their proffers, telling Signior Pietro the debt was paid before it was contracted; and would often lay his hand devoutly on his bo&s;om, and with a zealous &s;igh repeat this proverb, "The God of Heaven has given us plenty, that we may give Him what need requires." When they ar|rived at Malta, Signior Pietro &s;oon obtained the con&s;ent of the young lady's father, and their nup|tials were quickly after celebrated.</P>

<HEAD>INDULGENCE: Or the TWO SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a remark made by almo&s;t every one, that it is the unhappine&s;s of human nature never to be &s;atisfied. Philo&s;ophers &s;ay this propen&s;ity is the &s;pring of action, therefore nece&s;&s;ary. They add, likewi&s;e, that there is not that di&s;proportion in the happine&s;s of rich and poor, wi&s;e and fooli&s;h, &amp;c. &amp;c. as is generally imagined: nay, many have been
<PB N="193" REF="204">
bold enough to a&s;&s;ert, that content is more fre|quently found with poverty and folly, than with their oppo&s;ites. It is not our purpo&s;e to enquire, by a dry inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject, into the truth or fal&s;ehood of the&s;e opinions, but to leave the reader to make what applications he plea&s;es from the following tale; wherein, if we are not mi&s;taken, he will perceive the bad effects of fal&s;e education built upon fal&s;e hopes, and the nece&s;&s;ity of enuring the youthful mind, even from the cradle, to cro&s;&s;es. &mdash;Would not any man laugh to &s;ee a <HI>petit maitre</HI> attempting to carry the &s;ide of an ox, like a porter? How then can we expect a weak enervated mind to &s;upport tho&s;e wor&s;t of loads, poverty and con|tempt?</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Woodland, the parents of our he|roines, were once &s;ervants in the &s;ame family, which being a nobleman's, where they continually beheld the utmo&s;t luxury, and what is called politene&s;s and good breeding, they &s;oon acquired a &s;ufficient de|gree of contempt for their origin, and their former acquaintance. Having &s;aved &s;ome money, they married, quitted their &s;ervice, and betook them|&s;elves to bu&s;ine&s;s. Here Mrs. Woodland, who, of the two, had the mo&s;t violent ideas of gentility, in|&s;i&s;ted upon going into a genteel bu&s;ine&s;s, where they might have cu&s;tomers that under&s;tood good man|ners, and would pay a proper re&s;pect to people that knew how to <HI>bemean</HI> them&s;elves; for, &s;aid &s;he, I can never conde&s;cend to &s;tand behind a counter
<PB N="194" REF="205">
curt&s;eying and &s;erving out farthing candles and half|penny-worths of tobacco to every dirty wretch that comes in. Accordingly they opened a lace-&s;hop, which being well &s;ituated, an&s;wered their expecta|tions to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>Charlotte Woodland was their fir&s;t child, and the only one they had in eight years after their marriage.&mdash;Every expence was run into for the dre&s;s and education of this girl. She was pretty, and her parents thought her a cherub. She had a ready tongue, and they were continually repeating her &s;mart &s;ayings and witty an&s;wers. She learnt <HI>an oath</HI> from her father, and vulgarity from her mother, before &s;he was three years old; and her exploits were told and retold to every one that vi&s;ited her mamma.</P>
<P>As they were mutually re&s;olved that their daughter &s;hould not labour under that want of polite educa|tion, which they had frequent occa&s;ion to lament in them&s;elves, they &s;ent her at &s;ix years old to a boarding-&s;chool, where &s;he pickt up French phra&s;es without knowing any thing of the language, and run over the keys of a harp&s;ichord without time, tune, or &s;entiment. She, however, could draw patterns for her aprons and ruffles, acquired every new &s;titch with alacrity, and danced with more ea&s;e than the generality of her &s;chool-fellows; &s;he was vain as well as hand&s;ome, and therefore bent all her thoughts upon the means of decorating her per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="206">Her parents, for the fir&s;t eight or ten years of her life, had very great &s;ucce&s;s in trade; enough, had they been prudent, to have made what is u&s;ually called a pretty fortune. It was a pity that they had conceived &s;o violent a contempt for every thing that was low and vulgar. Mrs. Woodland could not exi&s;t without &s;ub&s;cribing to the Opera, Pantheon, &amp;c. &amp;c. becau&s;e every body did &s;o. She hated hor|rid Engli&s;h cottons, and filthy Spital-field tabbies: India chintz and French lu&s;trings were &s;o elegant! She was ready to faint at the idea of Buckingham|&s;hire lace; crown quadrille gave her the vapours; and being black-balled at the Coterie, threw her into hy&s;terics for &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>Mr. Woodland, though at fir&s;t very attentive to bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;oon fell into the mode of keeping his hor&s;e and his mi&s;tre&s;s, and in time became acquainted with the box and dice.</P>
<P>Laboured de&s;criptions are di&s;gu&s;ting; the read|er's imagination will ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t to him the ef|fects of this mutually fooli&s;h conduct. Mr. Wood|land, in the thirteenth year after he began bu&s;ine&s;s, became a bankrupt. Every one was amazed: the reputation of the &s;hop, and the appearance he had &s;o long &s;upported, had deceived the world.</P>
<P>Happy for their &s;econd daughter, was this afflic|tion. Affected manners, the epithets of adulation, and the proud airs of imagined con&s;equence, had not yet vitiated the tender mind of Maria; who obtained an advantage in the death of her mo|ther.
<PB N="196" REF="207">
Parents with bad habits and ill regulated pa&s;|&s;ions, are a misfortune rather than a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e who, by ob&s;erving, learn to imitate them. Maria was peculiarly fortunate. A widow lady with a &s;mall income, and without children or relations, whom chance had made acquainted with the fa|mily, ob&s;erved the natural &s;weetne&s;s of Maria's temper, and the acutene&s;s of her under&s;tanding, and took a fancy to her. This lady was the rever&s;e of Mrs. Woodland; elegance and affability had ba|ni&s;hed pride and affectation. She had &s;tudied in the &s;chools of adver&s;ity, and had learnt the heavenly le&s;&s;ons of humility and humanity.&mdash;Reader&mdash;if ever thou &s;hould&s;t have children, God &s;end them &s;uch an in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>Be not anxious to hear trifling incidents. Be|hold Maria in the nineteenth year of her age, with manners that might charm wi&s;dom her&s;elf, beauty &s;ufficient to a&s;toni&s;h a Reynolds, and married to a hu&s;band &s;uch as thou would&s;t wi&s;h, had&s;t thou an angel for thy child. Surely when a pair like this are companions, the road of matrimony is paved with plea&s;ures. If thy wi&s;hes outrun thy wants, if thy temper is petti&s;h, and thy heart proud, if thou halt not the art of making thy&s;elf beloved, think of Clermont and Maria with a &s;igh, and endeavour to reform.</P>
<P>Different was the de&s;tiny of the unfortunate Char|lotte. U&s;ed to the flattery of inferiors, the &s;word of neglect wounded &s;orely the pride of fallen &s;upe|riority.
<PB N="197" REF="208">
Her father, unable to place her to advan|tage in the world, or maintain her in the &s;chool, took her home. He now &s;oon di&s;covered the bad effects of the pre&s;ent fal&s;e mode of education. Hardly able to provide the mo&s;t &s;canty pittance, his daughter became a burthen in&s;tead of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. Ill qualified for dome&s;tic duties, the uncleanline&s;s of the temple proclaimed the indolence of the prie&s;te&s;s. &mdash;Oh ye fooli&s;h parents, why will you take &s;o much pains to teach your children &s;uch affected antics! Why will you encourage them to curl the no&s;e at the &s;ight of an unwa&s;hed &s;aucepan, or to &s;hiver at the touch of cold water! Mu&s;t the happine&s;s of life be &s;acrificed to the whitene&s;s of the hand? or why &s;hould the making a pie bani&s;h them from the &s;ociety of the rational? Make them gla&s;s cages at once, and &s;ay to unpoli&s;hed indu&s;try, "Behold what thou &s;hould&s;t be!"</P>
<P>But how &s;hould the &s;cholars be wi&s;e or virtuous, when the teachers, generally &s;peaking, are fooli&s;h and vicious?</P>
<P>Charlotte was unhappy at the change of her &s;itua|tion, and enjoyed only tho&s;e moments when &s;he had lei&s;ure to hang &s;ome of that finery upon her, which former opulence had provided. Girls are in this age more frequently undone by fal&s;e pride, than ea&s;y be|lief, and are in greater danger from the &s;upercilious airs of a mother, than the prote&s;tations of a lover. Vanity is almo&s;t univer&s;ally the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of youth. This was the rock on which Charlotte
<PB N="198" REF="209">
&s;truck; nor need we be &s;urpri&s;ed, when we con&s;ider the tempe&s;t which former flattery and pre&s;ent indi|gence had rai&s;ed to over&s;et &s;o weak a ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Among the acquaintance of her father's fortunate days, was Mr. Benfield, a man of property, and married. His principles varied with his pa&s;&s;ions, which reigned too ab&s;olutely; for though he made frequent profe&s;&s;ions of, and had great inclinations to virtue, yet were they the ma&s;ters of his rea&s;on, when|ever they had a &s;hare in the conflict. He had been &s;everal times with Mr. Woodland, to vi&s;it his daughter while at the boarding-&s;chool, and thought her very hand&s;ome; nay, had often told her &s;o, and was therefore one of her greate&s;t favourites. When misfortune had overwhelmed her father, the idea of obtaining her for a mi&s;tre&s;s being not entirely im|probable, laid fa&s;t hold upon his imagination. His daily vi&s;its were con&s;trued by the father into acts of the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted Woodland with his pur&s;e, and that corroborated the te&s;timony. His toying with Charlotte was thought to be the effect of former freedoms while &s;he was a child, and con|&s;idered rather as a conde&s;cen&s;ion than a de&s;ign. In &s;hort, he was continually &s;poken of by the father, as the only virtuous man he had ever known, and and who alone knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h merit in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

mi&s;lead girls; who have had le&s;s trifling educations than was the lot of Charlotte. Benfield would often &s;eat her upon his lap, ki&s;s her hand in rapture, &s;ome|times &s;natch one from her lips, tell her of her beauty, call her divine, then with a &s;igh &s;ay how happy he &s;hould have been, had heaven ble&s;t him with &s;uch a wife. Liberties which at fir&s;t are alarming to vir|tue, by repetition become familiar, and the lover who fir&s;t touches the mole upon his mi&s;tre&s;s's neck, and afterwards begs permi&s;&s;ion to ki&s;s it, might not be long, perhaps, before he would take the &s;ame freedom with the one upon her knee.</P>
<P>When the pa&s;&s;ions are warm, the mind is weak. Arguments, which to an unbia&s;&s;ed &s;pectator imme|diately di&s;cover their own futility, appear with all the force of truth, when they endeavour to prove what we mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h could be proved. Char|lotte li&s;tened with avidity, while Benfield talked to her of a &s;tate of nature, and of the inefficacy of mar|riage to bind affections, as well as the unrea&s;on|ablene&s;s of it in con&s;training tho&s;e to cohabit, who were always unhappy in each other's company. She began to think that a noble maxim, which &s;ays, "they only are truly married, who love each other, and live together without being obliged to do &s;o." She paid particular attention to Benfield, when he told her it was far better for her to live without the cere|mony of marriage, with one who pa&s;&s;ionately loved her, and would maintain her, not only above want, but in affluence, than to be tied to another
<PB N="200" REF="211">
who might not have &s;en&s;e to di&s;cover her merit, riches to keep her from indigence, not love &s;ufficient to u&s;e her with humanity.</P>
<P>The rude man is by no means &s;o dangerous to virtue as the plau&s;ible. Benfield prevailed, and Charlotte was &s;educed. He &s;tole her from her fa|ther, placed her in lodgings, and treated her at fir&s;t with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of love. She, unhappy girl, unacquainted with the caprice and mutability of pa&s;&s;ion, imagined that the little endearments were never to abate. She felt not her own growing indifference, but was quick at the di&s;covery of her lover's. Neglect produces bickerings; di&s;gu&s;t ha|tred;&mdash;&s;eparation en&s;ues.</P>

<P>In the &s;ituation I have de&s;cribed, was Charlotte found at midnight, freezing upon a &s;tep, by the ma&s;ter of the family, who happened to be detained till that late hour.

By &s;aying this I do not mean to court your applau&s;e; we have done nothing more than our duty. The duties of a parent are &s;o nume|rous, and demand &s;uch an unremitting attention, that, indeed, I never can hope to fulfil them per|fectly. However, my children, I hope we have omitted none of the great e&s;&s;entials, none that can &s;anctify the plea of ignorance for crimes, or for capital errors.

<P>Many neglect their duty only becau&s;e they do not know it; that, my children, we will endeavour &s;hall not be the ca&s;e with any of you. Polemo was one of the mo&s;t abandoned youths of Athens: he &s;eemed to delight not only in vice, but its infamy likewi&s;e.

From this we may &s;afely infer, he would never have been guilty of &s;uch di&s;graceful impro|prieties, had he before been better taught.</P>
<P>I am now going to recommend a duty intimately connected with what we have been reading and &s;ay|ing; which is Indu&s;try. It is the unhappine&s;s of wealthy people to imagine, at lea&s;t much too often, that they have no other avocations in this world, but the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure and the decoration of their per&s;ons, both of which, when carried to the lea&s;t exce&s;s, become criminal. I would have you under|&s;tand, my children, that though you are born to fortunes, you are not born to indolence. It is the duty of the rich at lea&s;t to be active; not to men|tion, that to be idle is to be unhappy. Li&s;ten to &s;he following allegory.</P>
<P>AS <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> was going abroad early to his labour, and climbing, with great patience, a lofty mountain over which he was obliged to pa&s;s, he e&s;pied on the
<PB N="205" REF="216">
&s;ummit a beautiful nymph employed in &s;earching for uncommon flowers, and often viewing with great attention the wide extended &s;cenes that were &s;tretched around her. Her eyes were piercing as the beams of the evening &s;tar, with a certain twink|ling wantonne&s;s in them that heightened the re&s;em|blance. Her features were irregular, yet not le&s;s plea&s;ing than tho&s;e of a more perfect beauty. She had a mo&s;t agreeable wildne&s;s in her air, her dre&s;s, her countenance; and &s;omething &s;o &s;peakably inqui|&s;itive in the latter, that almo&s;t every feature &s;eemed to a&s;k a que&s;tion. Upon the approach of <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> &s;he fell into immediate di&s;cour&s;e with him, and a&s;ked him, almo&s;t in the &s;ame breath, who he was, where he lived, whither he was going, and what there was in the neighbourhood worth &s;eeing. <HI>In|du&s;try,</HI> ever accu&s;tomed to make the be&s;t of his time, an&s;wered the la&s;t que&s;tion fir&s;t. He told her that there was nothing &s;o well worth &s;eeing as a beautiful plea&s;ure-hou&s;e in the adjacent wood, and offered to conduct her to it. The nymph, who&s;e name was <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> eagerly followed him, and by the number|le&s;s que&s;tions &s;he put to him as they pa&s;&s;ed, di&s;co|vered an in&s;atiable thir&s;t after knowledge. <HI>Indu&s;try,</HI> who liked the humour of the nymph, failed not to make every po&s;&s;ible advantage of this; and though &s;he found her&s;elf deceived in &s;ome points, when &s;he arrived at the wood, yet &s;he was gratified in &s;o many others, that &s;he could not help loving her deceiver, and yielding to every propo&s;al of his that might tend
<PB N="206" REF="217">
to her information. In con&s;equence of this conver|&s;ation, <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> in due time, brought forth a &s;on, who, by order from the Sylvan Deities, was named <HI>Travel.</HI> He was favoured by all the gods, and in his youth was frequently in&s;tructed by them in vi&s;ions. As he grew up he di&s;covered in his temper his mo|ther's thir&s;t of knowledge, and his father's activity; he never &s;taid longer in any place than, bee-like, to collect the &s;weets that he found there. <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> were his companions, and his attendants were <HI>Plenty</HI> and <HI>Variety.</HI> By ob&s;erving the manners and cu&s;toms of various nations, he became polite and unprejudiced; and by comparing their laws, and various modes of wor&s;hip and government, he learned to be ju&s;t and politic, and to &s;erve the gods acceptably. In a large city, where much was to be &s;een, he had recour&s;e for accommodations to the hou&s;e of a gentleman who was known to take a plea|&s;ure in entertaining travellers. The name of this per&s;on was <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI> He was a corpulent good-natured man. If he had but provi&s;ion for the day, and a companion to laugh away the hours, which were otherwi&s;e tedious to him, he was contented. He never interfered in the intere&s;t of others, nor felt the emotions either of friend&s;hip or enmity. He would not, on any account, go two furlongs from his own door, but u&s;ed to &s;ay, plea&s;ure and trouble were &s;uch inveterate enemies, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly meet upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion; he was much entertained with the conver&s;ation of <HI>Travel,</HI> and con|ceiving
<PB N="207" REF="218">
a de&s;ign to di&s;&s;uade him from rambling any more, that he might keep him with him, "My friend, &s;aid Idlene&s;s, I am amazed at your &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition. Who, like you, would for ever wander about, in &s;earch of plea&s;ure, and not &s;tand &s;till a moment to enjoy it? Why will you expo&s;e your&s;elf to perpetual dangers, and needle&s;s difficulties, and undergo abroad a thou&s;and inconveniencies which you would never meet with at home? Why &s;hould you, who are a free man, &s;ubmit to the arbitrary government of a &s;ea captain; more boi&s;terous than the element on which he commands: or to the no le&s;s ab&s;olute &s;way of an itinerant coachman?" "Truce with your queries, &s;aid <HI>Travel,</HI> till I have propo&s;ed an equal number; and then, if you plea&s;e, we will balance the account. How can <HI>you</HI> wa&s;te your time, and impair your health by refu&s;ing to give your body and mind that due exerci&s;e nature &s;o loudly calls for? How can you confine that arduous curio&s;ity, which was implanted in the &s;oul to urge you on to unbounded knowledge, within the narrow limits of a &s;ingle city or province? Are you really &s;o de&s;titute of courage as to be over-awed by vi&s;i|onary dangers and trivial inconveniencies?" Here ended the di&s;pute; <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> would not be at the pains to urge further arguments, nor, if he had, would <HI>Travel</HI> have &s;taid to hear them.</P>

<P>I will continue the &s;ubject, by reading you a little e&s;&s;ay, which I once wrote in an&s;wer to a friend of
<PB N="208" REF="219">
mine, who &s;eemed to be of opinion, that it was ra|tional, and almo&s;t virtuous, for men to be idle till they could have their property wholly to them&s;elves: that is, he looked upon the taxes paid to civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments not only to be enormous, but &s;hamefully mi&s;applied. Though this a&s;&s;ertion has too many glaring and notorious facts in its &s;up|port to leave any room for controver&s;y on that head, yet I never could think my friend's inference a ju&s;t one. What I have &s;aid was, however, but a &s;light and ha&s;ty &s;ketch, and will be more &s;uitable as a le&s;&s;on to my children, than an an&s;wer to the argu|ments of my friend. The be&s;t part of it is the fable with which it concludes, and from which I would have you draw the moral which is intended, namely, that the application of indu&s;try &s;hould be to great and proper objects, otherwi&s;e it becomes either tri|vial, ridiculous, or criminal.</P>

<HEAD>INDUSTRY: An ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>The general importance of indu&s;try to &s;ociety is a thing &s;o &s;elf-evident, that it &s;tands in need of no ar|guments to convince mankind of its truth. Indivi|duals are neither happy in them&s;elves, nor u&s;eful to others, till they are indu&s;trious. Idlene&s;s re&s;embles an excre&s;cence painful in it&s;elf, and di&s;gu&s;ting to the beholders; and which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or wi&s;hes to cut away, but wants re&s;olution. Some men, like bene|volent philo&s;ophers, and true friends to the rights of
<PB N="209" REF="220">
mankind, wi&s;h for ab&s;olute freedom, that men may be encouraged to indu&s;try by having their property &s;ole, and undivided, to their own u&s;e; that they may not be &s;hackled by the degrading recollection of de|pendence, nor deterred by the rapacity of power; that is, by tho&s;e men who formally &s;eize upon, and lawfully rob you of, a certain part of your property, which they appropriate, too frequently, to the mo&s;t de&s;tructive purpo&s;es: namely, to that of en&s;laving you &s;till farther.</P>
<P>That there are wicked governments, nay, that there are no good governments, and that there are wicked men in the be&s;t of governments, may readily be admitted. That a &s;ociety formed upon the liberal principles the&s;e philo&s;ophers &s;o ju&s;tly admire, would be the only rational one among equals is likewi&s;e granted: but the fact is, men are not equal, and this inequality precludes the po&s;&s;ibility of ab&s;olute freedom. The cunning man outwits the &s;imple, the &s;trong &s;ubdues the weak; the man who&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions are inordinate, wilfully en&s;laves him&s;elf to him who can gratify them, and he who has had the mis|fortune to have had a fooli&s;h, or a weak father, be|comes, unhappily, the inheritor of &s;lavery. This &s;lavery, however, is only partial: in the very wor&s;t of governments, the motives to indu&s;try are &s;uffi|ciently powerful and beneficial to incite men to action. Engli&s;hmen, in particular, have, upon com|pari&s;on, great rea&s;on to ble&s;s that chance which placed them on this &s;pot rather than the generality of
<PB N="210" REF="221">
others; rather, perhaps, than any other upon earth. Property is, here, &s;o far &s;ecured, that no depreda|tions can be committed, but authorized and legal ones: and, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the&s;e are numerous, yet the aggregate is not &s;ufficient, by any means, to damp the &s;pirit of indu&s;try. No titled villain lays his rapacious talons on the widow's mite; no tyrant fa&s;tens his di&s;graceful badge upon her offspring; no ferocious Boyar or Vaivod enu|merates the hu&s;bandman among the other animals that graze upon what he unju&s;tly calls <HI>his</HI> land. We are protected, not only from the ravages of indivi|duals, but from the ravages of nations; and the exactions we &s;uffer make our part of the contribu|tion to the general expence. That the&s;e contri|butions are continually perverted cannot be denied; but, till we can find men who do not love them&s;elves better than the re&s;t of mankind, this mu&s;t ever be the ca&s;e. I do not mean to in&s;inuate, that we &s;hould re&s;t contented under impo&s;ition, however &s;anctified by the hoary head of cu&s;tom, or enforced by the iron hand of law: no, let us emancipate our|&s;elves by every worthy means, let us ca&s;t off every di&s;graceful, galling chain; let us beware that it does not become heavier, and more galling; but, it is the per&s;evering effort of indu&s;try only that can effect this: and, as pa&s;&s;ions, affections, and weak|ne&s;&s;es, prevent us from any thing like perfection, do not let us torment our&s;elves, and &s;lacken our la|bours, by meditating on, and hoping for, ideal ble&s;|&s;ings,
<PB N="211" REF="222">
which the nature and inequality of man forbid to be realized. I &s;peak as I think, as I feel, but with every deference and re&s;pect to the arguments of tho&s;e who hold contrary opinions.</P>
<P>Let us amu&s;e our&s;elves, for a moment, by ima|gining the poetical origin, and actions of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>In the early ages of the world, before men multi|plied and &s;pread over the face of the earth, and, by their irregularities, bani&s;hed the beneficent Deities from their &s;ociety, the Sylvan God of the Oaks, called Per&s;everance, became in love with Agility, the nymph of the rocks; and though he was neither young, beautiful, or beloved, yet, by his ince&s;&s;ant importunities, he at length prevailed. The nymphs of ancient, as well as modern times, have often yielded to importunity. The child Indu&s;try was the offspring of this amour. He was the beloved of his parents, for he partook of tho&s;e qualities for which each was the mo&s;t e&s;teemed. He was &s;trong and active, with an ugly countenance, and broad hands; he was not very tall, but his body was well proportioned, and his large limbs proclaimed dura|tion. The &s;ports of his infancy were peculiar. He &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him&s;elf with inventing in&s;tru|ments of hou&s;ewifery and agriculture, and for other u&s;eful and dome&s;tic purpo&s;es; and, it is &s;aid, his mother one day &s;urprized him when he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed the fir&s;t rude &s;ketch of a &s;pinning-wheel, and was diverting him&s;elf with turning it round, and ob&s;erving its effects. The loom, likewi&s;e, is &s;aid
<PB N="212" REF="223">
to have been one of the early efforts of his imagination; and which procured him everla&s;ting honour and prai&s;e among men. He pre&s;ently became a con&s;tant and &s;tudious ob&s;erver of cau&s;e and effect; and made re|gi&s;ters of his ob&s;ervations, at fir&s;t, by notching the trees, afterwards by hieroglyphics, and, la&s;t of all, by various and amazingly intricate combinations of characters, which yet, by his exce&s;&s;ive a&s;&s;iduity, be|came tolerably &s;imple, and quite intelligible. This, however, was the effect of ince&s;&s;ant and unde&s;criba|ble labour; for it is &s;aid by &s;ome, that, till he came among men, and in&s;tructed them, they had no re|gular method of conveying their ideas; that they had no language, but gabbled a few inarticulate and unintelligible &s;ounds, expre&s;&s;ive of rage and fear, and &s;ome of the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions, from which he produced his &s;y&s;tem. Long, however, before this, he di&s;covered, by his penetration, the metals that lay hid and buried in the bowels of the earth; and that had lain there from time immemorial. He brought forth iron from a &s;tone, and made of it the axe, the hoe, the &s;aw, and a thou&s;and curious and u&s;eful implements. He ob&s;erved the &s;wine, that u&s;ed to root up the ground for the acorn, the pignut, and other delicacies: he &s;aw the green verdure follow their tracks, and the young blade &s;hoot where they had &s;oiled: from whence he learned the u&s;e of the plough and the manure. Nothing was too vile to e&s;cape his attention, nor was any thing too in|comprehen&s;ible to elude his enquiries. He pre&s;ently
<PB N="213" REF="224">
became &s;o renowned, by the beneficial effects of his re&s;earches and labours, that he was deified, placed with the gods, and wor&s;hipped under various &s;ymbols by the &s;ons of men. In the mean time his la|bours over&s;pread the face of the earth: he not only built habitations for men, defended them from wild bea&s;ts, took care of their &s;eed time and harve&s;t, and taught them the common arts of life, but he, al&s;o, in&s;tructed them in the occult properties of nature. He &s;hewed them to heal their wounds by the green herb, to exterminate poi&s;on, and to calculate the cour&s;e of the &s;tars. For their plea&s;ure and conve|nience he built cities, palaces, and temples. Mau|&s;oleums, pyramids, and towers, ro&s;e from the hard entrails of the rock. Mountains were levelled, ri|vers obeyed the cour&s;e of his directing arm, and ca&s;tles floated upon the great waters, and defied their fury.</P>
<P>Happy had it been for men, had he been as pru|dent in his amours as his father; but, alas! he be|came enamoured with that pro&s;titute Luxury. Fa&s;|cinated by her &s;educing charms, and led a&s;tray by her &s;pecious &s;ophi&s;ms, his labours have degenerated, have become de&s;tructive, and, in&s;tead of his former &s;tupendous works, he is, at pre&s;ent, a Man-mil|liner, &s;tains tooth-picks, weaves gauze ribbands, and metamorpho&s;es &s;econd-hand &s;ar&s;net, and twice-died Per&s;ian, into artificial flowers.</P>

<P>THE &s;ubject of ye&s;terday, my children, is &s;o con&s;equential to happine&s;s, that I cannot avoid renewing it, in order to point out &s;ome more of its duties and advantages, and impre&s;s them &s;till &s;tronger on your memories. Per&s;everance is the leading characteri&s;tic of indu&s;try. By per&s;everance, men of moderate parts have accompli&s;hed what had be|fore been deemed impo&s;&s;ible. Li&s;ten to the ra|pidity, the a&s;toni&s;hingly preci&s;e agreement of ideas, in a band of mu&s;icians; look at the exact and me|chanical preci&s;ion with which one man at the head of an army regulates the actions of ten, twenty, or of a hundred thou&s;and, and you will be convinced of the powers of per&s;everance.</P>
<P>A country gentleman had an e&s;tate of two hundred a year, which he kept in his own hands till he found him&s;elf &s;o much in debt, that he was obliged to &s;ell one half to &s;atisfy his creditors, and lett the remainder to a farmer for one-and-twenty years. Before the expiration of his lea&s;e, the farmer a&s;ked the gentle|man, when he came one day to pay his rent, whether he would &s;ell the land he occupied? Why; will you buy it? &s;aid the gentleman;&mdash;if you will part with it,
<PB N="215" REF="226">
and we can agree, replied the farmer. That is ex|ceedingly &s;trange, &s;aid the gentleman. Pray tell me how it happens that I could not live upon twice as much land, for which I paid no rent, and that you, after regularly paying me a hundred a year for the half, are able, in a few years, to purcha&s;e it? The rea&s;on is plain, an&s;wered the farmer; you &s;at &s;till, and &s;aid go; I got up, and &s;aid come; you laid in bed, and enjoyed your ea&s;e; I ro&s;e in the morning, and minded my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Hear another anecdote, more &s;ingular, but of the &s;ame nature. When collection was making to build the ho&s;pital of Bedlam, tho&s;e who were employed to gather the money, came to a &s;mall hou&s;e, the door of which was half open; from the entry they over|heard an old man &s;colding his &s;ervant maid, who, having made u&s;e of a match to kindle the fire, had afterwards indi&s;creetly thrown it away, without re|flecting that the match, having &s;till the &s;ulphur at the other end might be of further &s;ervice. After diverting them&s;elves awhile with li&s;tening to the di&s;pute, they knocked, and pre&s;ented them&s;elves before the old gentleman. As &s;oon as they told him the cau&s;e of their vi&s;it, he went into a clo&s;et, from whence he brought four hundred guineas, and reckoning the money in their pre&s;ence, put it into their bag. The collectors being a&s;toni&s;hed at this genero&s;ity, which they little expected, could not help te&s;tifying their &s;urpri&s;e, and told the old fellow what they had heard. "Gentleman, &s;aid he, your &s;ur|pri&s;e
<PB N="216" REF="227">
is occa&s;ioned by a thing of very little con&s;e|quence; I keep hou&s;e, and &s;ave or &s;pend money my own way, the one furni&s;hes me with the means of doing the other, and both equally gratify my incli|nations. With regard to benefactions and dona|tions, always expect mo&s;t from prudent people who keep their accounts."</P>
<P>Few things truly great or good, my children, can be performed but by a per&s;evering indu&s;try. Noble minds, with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, are makers of their own fortune. There is &s;carcely any knowledge, any art, or any dignity unattainable to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s under&s;tanding, indu&s;try and per&s;everance. An at|tention to little things, with a capability of great ones, are the leading features of the character I de|&s;cribe. When Sir Walter Raleigh fir&s;t came to London to &s;eek his fortune, he was poor and un|known, yet well-dre&s;&s;ed, carrying all his riches upon his back; for his hopes and views were com|prehen&s;ive. Happening one day to &s;ee Queen Eli|zabeth walking till &s;he came to a dirty place, at which &s;he &s;eemed to make &s;ome &s;cruple of &s;tepping over, he immediately pulled off his new plu&s;h cloak, and &s;pread it for her to tread on. The gallantry of this action, and the obliging unembara&s;&s;ed air with which it was performed, were a certain introduc|tion to the court of Elizabeth. When he fir&s;t began to be noticed, he wrote upon a gla&s;s window, in the eye of the Queen:&mdash;
<Q><PB N="217" REF="228">Fain would I climb, but that I fear to fall.</Q></P>
<P>Elizabeth ob&s;erving it, wrote underneath,
<Q>If thy heart fail thee, do not climb at all.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Walter was not really afraid, this was only an artifice. Every body knows how great a man he afterwards became.</P>
<P>When the Spartans had treacherou&s;ly &s;eized on the ca&s;tle called Cadmaea, and by that means en|&s;laved the Thebans, Archias, one of the governors in the Spartan intere&s;t, was &s;itting at a fea&s;t. He re|ceived letters which he was de&s;ired to open and read immediately, for they contained information of the greate&s;t importance; but Archias being full of mirth, and heated with wine, threw them by, and &s;aid, laughing, "bu&s;ine&s;s to-morrow." This negligence co&s;t him his life, for that very evening Pelopidas, Charon, and others, having formed a re&s;olution to free their country, &s;lew him, and many more, who were in the Spartan intere&s;t, which &s;carcely could have happened had Archias read the letters, they being &s;ent purpo&s;ely to inform him of his dan|ger. "Bu&s;ine&s;s to-morrow" became ever after a &s;atirical proverb in Greece.</P>
<P>I tell you the&s;e anecdotes, my children, to &s;hew you the con&s;equences of negligence, and the benefits ari&s;ing from per&s;everance, vigilance, and indu&s;try;
<PB N="218" REF="229">
and I cannot better in&s;truct you to what purpo&s;es the&s;e great and nece&s;&s;ary properties ought to be ap|plied, than by referring you to the fable of Mirza.</P>

<HEAD>SOCIAL DUTY, Or MIRZA.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. EGERTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT plea&s;ed the mighty &s;overeign Abbas Cara&s;can, from whom the Kings of the earth derive honour and dominion, to &s;et Mirza his &s;ervant over the province of Tauris. In the hand of Mirza, the ba|lance of di&s;tribution was &s;u&s;pended with impartiality; and under his admini&s;tration the weak were pro|tected, the learned received honour, and the diligent became rich: Mirza, therefore, was beheld by every eye with complacency, and every tongue pronounced ble&s;&s;ings upon his head. But it was ob&s;erved that he derived no joys from the benefits which he diffu&s;ed; he became pen&s;ive and melancholy; he &s;pent his lei|&s;ure in &s;olitude; in his palace he &s;at motionle&s;s upon a &s;opha; and when he went out, his walk was &s;low, and his eyes were fixed upon the ground: he applied to the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tate with reluctance; and re&s;olved to relinqui&s;h the toils of government, of which he could no longer enjoy the reward.</P>
<P>He therefore obtained permi&s;&s;ion to approach the throne of his &s;overeign; and being a&s;ked what was
<PB N="219" REF="230">
his reque&s;t, he made this reply, "May the Lord of the world forgive the &s;lave whom he has honoured, if Mirza pre&s;ume again to lay the bounty of Abbas at his feet. Thou ha&s;t given me the dominions of a country, fruitful as the gardens of Dama&s;cus: and of a city, glorious above all others, except that only which reflects the &s;plendor of thy pre&s;ence. But the longe&s;t life is a period &s;carce &s;ufficient to prepare for death. All other bu&s;ine&s;s is vain and trivial, as the toil of emmets in the path of the traveller, under who&s;e foot they peri&s;h for ever; and all enjoyment is un&s;ub&s;tantial and evane&s;cent, as the colours of the bow that appear in the interval of a &s;torm. Suffer me, therefore, to prepare for the approach of eterni|ty; let me give up my &s;oul to meditation; let &s;oli|tude and &s;ilence acquaint me with the my&s;teries of devotion; let me forget the world, and by the world be forgotten, till the moment arrives in which the veil of eternity &s;hall fall, and I be found at the bar of the Almighty."&mdash;Mirza then bowed him&s;elf to the earth, and &s;tood &s;ilent.</P>
<P>By the command of Abbas it is recorded, that at the&s;e words he trembled upon that throne, at the foot|&s;tool of which the world pays homage: he looked round upon his nobles, but every countenance was pale, and every eye was upon the earth. No man opened his mouth; and the King fir&s;t broke &s;ilence after it had continued near an hour.</P>
<P>"Mirza! terror and doubt are come upon me: I am alarmed, as a man who &s;uddenly perceives that
<PB N="220" REF="231">
he is near the brink of a precipice, and is urged forward by an irre&s;i&s;tible force; but yet I know not whether my danger is a reality or a dream.&mdash;I am as thou art, a reptile on the earth; my life is a mo|ment; and eternity, in which days, and years, and ages are nothing, eternity is before me, for which I al&s;o &s;hould prepare: but by whom then mu&s;t the faithful be governed? By tho&s;e only who have no fear of judgment? By tho&s;e alone who&s;e life is brutal, becau&s;e like brutes, they do not con&s;ider that they &s;hall die? Or who, indeed, are the faithful? Are the bu&s;y multitudes that crowd the city, in a &s;tate of perdition? And is the cell of the dervi&s;e alone the gate of paradi&s;e? To all, the life of a dervi&s;e is not po&s;&s;ible: to all therefore it cannot be a duty. De|part to the hou&s;e which has in the city been prepared for thy re&s;idence; I will meditate the rea&s;on of thy reque&s;t; and may he who illuminates the mind of the humble, enable me to determine with wi&s;dom!"</P>
<P>Mirza departed; and on the third day, having re|ceived no commands, he again reque&s;ted an audi|ence, and it was granted. When he entered the royal pre&s;ence, his countenance appeared more chear|ful; he drew a letter from his bo&s;om, and having ki&s;&s;ed it, he pre&s;ented it with his right-hand.</P>
<P>"My Lord, &s;ays he, I have learned by this letter, which I received from Co&s;rou the Iman, who now &s;tands before thee, in what manner life may be be&s;t improved. I am enabled to look back with plea&s;ure, and forward with hope; and I &s;hall now rejoice &s;till
<PB N="221" REF="232">
to be the &s;hadow of thy power at Tauris, and to keep tho&s;e honours which I &s;o lately wi&s;hed to re|&s;ign."&mdash;The King, who had li&s;tened to Mirza with a mixture of &s;urpri&s;e and curio&s;ity, immediately gave the letter to Co&s;rou, and commanded that it &s;hould be read. The eyes of the court were at once turned on the hoary &s;age, who&s;e countenance was &s;uffu&s;ed with an hone&s;t blu&s;h; and it was not without &s;ome he&s;itation that he read the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"To Mirza, whom the wi&s;dom of Abbas our mighty Lord has honoured with dominion, be ever|la&s;ting health! When I heard thy purpo&s;e to with|draw the ble&s;&s;ings of thy government from the thou|&s;ands of Tauris, my heart was wounded with the ar|row of affliction, and my eyes became dim with &s;orrow. But who &s;hall &s;peak before the King, when he is troubled? and who &s;hall boa&s;t of knowledge, when he is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by doubt? To thee I will relate the events of my youth, which thou ha&s;t renewed before me; and tho&s;e truths which they taught me, may the prophet multiply to thee.</P>
<P>"Under the in&s;truction of the phy&s;ician Aluazer, I obtained an early knowledge of his art. To tho&s;e who were &s;mitten with di&s;ea&s;es, I could admini&s;ter plants, which the &s;un had impregnated with the &s;pirits of health. But the &s;cenes of pain, languor, and mortality, which were perpetually ri&s;ing before me, made me often tremble for my&s;elf. I &s;aw the grave open at my feet: I determined, therefore, to contemplate only the regions beyond it, and to de|&s;pi&s;e
<PB N="222" REF="233">
every acqui&s;ition that I could not keep. I con|ceived an opinion, that as there was no merit but in voluntary poverty, and &s;ilent meditation, tho&s;e who de&s;ired money were not proper objects of bounty; therefore money was de&s;pi&s;ed. I buried mine in the earth; and renouncing &s;ociety, I wan|dered into a wild and &s;eque&s;tered part of the coun|try; my dwelling was a cave, by the &s;ide of a hill; I drank the running water from the &s;pring, and eat &s;uch fruits and herbs as I could find. To increa&s;e the au&s;terity of my life, I frequently watched all night, &s;itting at the entrance of the cave with my face to the ea&s;t, re&s;igning my&s;elf to the &s;ecret in|fluences of the prophet, and expecting illuminations from above. One morning, after my nocturnal vigil, ju&s;t as I perceived the horizon glow at the ap|proach of the &s;un, the power of &s;leep became irre|&s;i&s;tible, and I &s;unk under it. I imagined my&s;elf &s;till &s;itting at the entrance of my cell; that the dawn in|crea&s;ed; and that as I looked earne&s;tly for the fir&s;t beam of day, a dark &s;pot appeared to intercept it. I perceived that it was in motion; it increa&s;ed in &s;ize as it drew near, and at length I di&s;covered it to be an eagle. I &s;till kept my eye &s;teadfa&s;tly upon it, and &s;aw it alight at a &s;mall di&s;tance, where I now de&s;cried a fox, who&s;e fore-legs appeared to be broken. Before this fox the eagle laid part of a kid, which it had brought in its talons, and then di&s;appeared. When I awaked I laid my fore-head upon the ground, and ble&s;&s;ed the prophet for the in&s;truction of the morning.
<PB N="223" REF="234">
I reviewed my dream, and &s;aid thus to my&s;elf, "Co&s;rou, thou ha&s;t done well to renounce the tu|mult, the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the vanities of life; but thou ha&s;t as yet only done it in part; thou art &s;till every day bu&s;ied in the &s;earch of food, thy mind is not wholly at re&s;t, neither is thy tru&s;t in Providence complete. What art thou taught by this vi&s;ion? If thou ha&s;t &s;een an eagle commi&s;&s;ioned by heaven to feed a fox that is lame, &s;hall not the hand of heaven al&s;o &s;upply thee with food, when that which prevents thee from procuring it to thy&s;elf, is not nece&s;&s;ity, but devotion? I was now &s;o confident of a mira|culous &s;upply, that I neglected to walk out for my repa&s;t, which, after the fir&s;t day, I expected with an impatience that left me little power of attending to any other object: this impatience, however, I la|boured to &s;uppre&s;s, and per&s;i&s;ted in my re&s;olution; but my eyes at length began to fail me, and my knees &s;mote each other; I threw my&s;elf backward, and hoped my weakne&s;s would &s;oon increa&s;e to in&s;en&s;ibi|lity. But I was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by the voice of an invi&s;ible being, who pronounced the&s;e words:&mdash; "Co&s;rou, I am the angel who, by the command of the Almighty, have regi&s;tered the thoughts of thy heart, which I am now commi&s;&s;ioned to reprove. While thou wa&s;t attempting to become wi&s;e above that which is revealed, thy folly perverted the in|&s;tructions which was vouch&s;afed thee. Art thou di&s;abled as the fox? Ha&s;t thou not rather the powers of the eagle? Ari&s;e, let the eagle be the object of
<PB N="224" REF="235">
thy emulation. To pain and &s;ickne&s;s be thou again the me&s;&s;enger of ea&s;e and health. Virtue is not re&s;t but action. If thou do&s;t good to man, as an evi|dence of thy love to God, thy virtue will be exalted from moral to divine; and that happine&s;s which is the pledge of paradi&s;e, will be thy reward upon earth."</P>
<P>"At the&s;e words I was not le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than if a mountain had been overturned at my feet. I humbled my&s;elf in the du&s;t; I returned to the city; I dug up my trea&s;ure; I was liberal, yet I became rich. My &s;kill in re&s;toring health to the body, gave me frequent opportunities of curing the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;oul. I put on the &s;acred ve&s;tments; I grew eminent beyond my merit; and it was the plea&s;ure of the King that I &s;hould &s;tand before him. Now, therefore, be not offended; I boa&s;t of no knowledge that I have not received: as the &s;ands of the de&s;art drink up the drops of rain and the dew of the morning, &s;o do I al&s;o, who am but du&s;t, imbibe the in&s;tructions of the prophet. Believe then that it is he who tells thee, all knowledge is prophane which ter|minates in thy&s;elf; and by a life wa&s;ted in &s;pecula|tion, little even of this can be gained. When the gates of paradi&s;e are thrown open before thee, thy mind &s;hall be irradiated in a moment; here thou can&s;t little more than pile error upon error; there thou &s;halt build truth upon truth. Wait therefore for the glorious vi&s;ion; and in the mean time emu|late the eagle. Much is in thy power; and, there|fore,
<PB N="225" REF="236">
much is expected of thee. Though the Al|mighty alone can give virtue, yet, as a Prince, thou maye&s;t &s;timulate tho&s;e to beneficence, who act from no higher motive than immediate intere&s;t. Thou can&s;t not produce the principle, but maye&s;t enforce the practice. The relief of the poor is equal, whether they receive it from o&s;tentation or charity; and the effect of example is the &s;ame, whether it be intended to obtain the favour of God, or man. Let thy virtue be thus diffu&s;ed; and if thou believe&s;t with reverence, thou &s;halt be accepted above. Fare|well. May the &s;mile of him who re&s;ides in the heaven of heavens, be upon thee! And again&s;t thy name in the volume of his will, may happine&s;s be written!"</P>
<P>The King, who&s;e doubts, like tho&s;e of Mirza, were now removed, looked up with a &s;mile that communicated the joy of his mind. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Prince to his government; and commanded the&s;e events to be recorded, to the end that po&s;terity may know, "That no life is plea&s;ing to God, but that which is u&s;eful to mankind!"</P>

<HEAD>PERSEVERANCE: Or the HISTORY of Profe&s;&s;or DU VAL.</HEAD>
<P>M. DU VAL, profe&s;&s;or of hi&s;tory and geogra|phy in the academy of Luneville, is the &s;on of a pea|&s;ant, and born in Burgundy, but came into Lorrain when a child, and was employed as a &s;hepherd's boy, at a village near Nancy. His thir&s;t after knowledge appeared in his very childhood, and, having no other means of gratifying it, he made a collection of &s;nakes, frogs, &amp;c. amu&s;ed him&s;elf with examining the&s;e creatures, and was continually a&s;king the neigh|bouring pea&s;ants why tho&s;e animals were formed in &s;uch a particular manner? but the an&s;wers he re|ceived were generally &s;uch, as left him le&s;s &s;atisfied than he was before. He once happened to &s;ee, in the hand of a country boy, Ae&s;op's Fables with cuts, which made him &s;till more de&s;irous of learning than before. He could not read; and the boy,
<PB N="228" REF="239">
who was capable of gratifying his curio&s;ity, was &s;eldom in a humour to explain the animals, &amp;c. repre&s;ented in the cuts. In this di&s;tre&s;s, he deter|mined to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the introduction to knowledge, however great the difficulties that attended it might prove. Accordingly he &s;aved whatever money he could get, and gave it to other boys who were older than him&s;elf, for teaching him to read. Having, with incredible diligence, attained his end, he happened to meet with an almanack, in which the twelve &s;igns of the zodiac were delineated. The&s;e he looked for &s;o con&s;tantly, and with &s;uch at|tention, in the heavens, that at la&s;t he imagined that he actually traced &s;uch figures there; and though he was mi&s;taken in this and &s;everal other particulars, yet many of his ob&s;ervations were &s;uch as few others are found capable of, even after receiving regular in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>As he once pa&s;&s;ed by a print-&s;hop at Nancy, he ob&s;erved in the window a map of the world. This opened a field for new &s;peculations; and, having purcha&s;ed it, he employed many hours every day in peru&s;ing it. At fir&s;t he took the degrees on the equator for French leagues; but upon con&s;idering that, in coming from Burgundy to Lorrain, he had travelled many &s;uch leagues, though on his map that di&s;tance &s;eemed to take up a very little &s;pot, he was convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility of his fir&s;t conjecture. But it mu&s;t have been with incredible labour, and at the &s;ame time is a &s;ignal proof of his extraordinary
<PB N="229" REF="240">
genius, that he acquired a thorough knowledge of the&s;e and many other &s;ignatures on the &s;everal maps; which, as often as his pur&s;e could afford it, he after|wards procured.</P>
<P>His inclination for &s;ilence and retirement, made him weary of living among the noi&s;y pea&s;ant boys; and induced him to vi&s;it &s;ome hermits who had their cells in a wood, about half a league from Luneville. He undertook to wait on them, and to tend &s;ix or eight cows which they kept. The&s;e hermits were, how|ever, gro&s;sly ignorant; but Du Val had an opportu|nity of reading &s;everal books he found in their cells, and of getting many difficulties, that occurred to him, &s;olved by per&s;ons who came to vi&s;it them. All the money he could &s;crape together in his mean circum&s;tances, was laid out in books and maps; and ob&s;erving, on &s;ome of the latter, the arms of &s;everal princes, as griffins, &s;pread eagles, lions with two tails, and other mon&s;ters, he enquired of a foreigner, whether there were any &s;uch creatures in the world? being informed that the&s;e figures belonged to a parti|cular &s;cience called heraldry, he minuted down this word, before unknown to him, and hurrying with all &s;peed to Nancy, bought a book of heraldry, and by that book, without any other help, he became ma&s;ter of the fundamental principles of that &s;cience.</P>
<P>In this cour&s;e of life Du Val continued till he ar|rived at his one-and-twentieth year, when, in the autumn of 1717, he was di&s;covered watching his charge in the wood, and &s;itting under a tree with

his maps and books about him, by Baron P&s;utchner. This gentleman was then governor to the young Prince of Lorrain, who happened to hunt that way. The Baron thought a herd&s;man, with &s;un-burnt lank hair, dre&s;&s;ed in a coar&s;e linen frock, with a heap of maps about him, &s;o extraordinary a &s;ight, that he informed the Prince of it, who immediately rode towards the place, and put &s;everal que&s;tions to Du Val about his way of living. Du Val &s;hewed by his an&s;wers, that he was already ma&s;ter of the grounds of &s;everal &s;ciences. Upon which the Prince offered to take him into his &s;ervice, and told him that he &s;hould go to court. Du Val, who had read in &s;ome books of morality, that the air of a court was infectious to virtue; and had al&s;o ob|&s;erved when he had been at Nancy, that the lacqueys of great men were a riotous, debauched, quarrel|&s;ome &s;ort of people, frankly an&s;wered, "That he cho&s;e rather to look after his herd, and continue to lead a quiet life in the wood, with which he was thoroughly &s;atisfied, than to wait on the Prince; but added, that if his highne&s;s would give him an opportunity of reading curious books, and of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of more learning and know|ledge, he was ready to follow him or any body el&s;e." The Prince was highly plea&s;ed with his an&s;wer; and, when he returned to court, prevailed on the Duke his father, to &s;end this extraordinary herd&s;man to the Je&s;uits College at Pont-a-Mou&s;&s;on.

the Duke permittted him to take a journey into France for his further improvement; and, &s;oon after his return, gave him a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in the academy of Luneville, with a pen&s;ion of 700 livres a year, al&s;o made him his own librarian, which is worth 1000 livres a year more, be&s;ides a hand&s;ome apart|ment.</P>

<HEAD>HEALTH: Or the VICAR.</HEAD>
<P>GOING to vi&s;it an old friend at his country &s;eat la&s;t week, I found him at backgammon with the Vicar of the pari&s;h. My friend received me with the heartie&s;t welcome, and introduced the Doc|tor to my acquaintance. This gentleman, who &s;eemed to be about fifty, and of a florid and healthy con&s;titution, &s;urveyed me all over with great atten|tion, and, after a &s;light nod of the head, &s;at him&s;elf down without opening his mouth. I was a little hurt at the &s;upercilious behaviour of this divine; which my friend ob&s;erving told me very plea&s;antly, that I was rather too old to be intitled to the Doc|tor's complai&s;ance; for that he &s;eldom be&s;towed it, but upon the young and vigorous: But, &s;ays he, you &s;hall know him better &s;oon, and you will find him altogether as odd a character, as he is a worthy one. The Doctor made no reply to this raillery, but con|tinued &s;ome time with his eyes fixed upon me, and at la&s;t, &s;haking his head, and turning to my friend, a&s;ked if he would play out the other hit. My friend excu&s;ed him&s;elf from engaging any more that even|ing, and ordered a bottle of wine, with pipes and tobacco, to be &s;et on the table. The Vicar filled
<PB N="233" REF="244">
his pipe, and drank very cordially to my friend, &s;till eyeing me with a &s;eeming di&s;like, and neither drink|ing my health, nor &s;peaking a &s;ingle word to me. As I have long accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to drink nothing but water, I called for a bottle of it, and drank gla&s;s for gla&s;s with them; which upon the Doctor's ob&s;erving, he &s;hook his head at my friend, and, in a whi&s;per loud enough for me to hear, &s;aid, 'Poor man, it is all over with him, I &s;ee.' My friend &s;miled, and an&s;wered, in the &s;ame audible whi&s;per, 'No, no, Doctor, he intends to live as long as either of us.' He then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me on the occurrences of the town, and engaged me in a very chearful conver&s;ation, which la&s;ted till I with|drew to re&s;t; at which time the Doctor ro&s;e from his chair, drank a bumper to my health, and, giving me a hearty &s;hake by the hand, told me I was a very jolly old gentleman, and that he wi&s;hed to be better acquainted with me, during my &s;tay in the country.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e early in the morning, and found the Doctor in the breakfa&s;ting room. He &s;aluted me with great civility, and told me he had left his bed and home &s;ooner than u&s;ual, to have the plea&s;ure of taking a walk with me. 'Your friend, &s;ays he, is but lately recovered from an attack of the gout, and will hardly be &s;tirring, till we have gone over his improvements.' I accepted the propo&s;al, and we walked through a very elegant garden into the mo&s;t beautiful fields that can be imagined; which as I &s;topped to admire, the Doctor began thus: 'The&s;e are, indeed, very
<PB N="234" REF="245">
delightful grounds; and I wi&s;h, with all my heart, that the owner of them was le&s;s troubled with the gout, that I might hold him in more re&s;pect.'&mdash; 'Re&s;pect! Doctor,' &s;aid I, interrupting him, 'Does a painful di&s;temper, acquired by no act of intem|perance, le&s;&s;en your re&s;pect?' 'It does indeed, and I wi&s;h, in this in&s;tance, I could help it; for I am under many obligations to your friend. There is another very worthy gentleman in the neighbour|hood, who pre&s;ented me to this vicarage; he has the misfortune to labour under an inveterate &s;curvy, which, by &s;ubjecting him to continual head-achs, mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, &s;horten his days; and &s;o I never go near him.'</P>
<P>I was going to interrupt the Doctor again, when a coach and &s;ix drove by us along the road, and in it a gentleman, who let down the gla&s;s, and made the Doctor a very re&s;pectful bow; which in&s;tead of returning, he looked off with a &s;tately air, and took no notice of him. This in&s;tance of his beha|viour, together with the conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;|ed between us, rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity to a very high degree, and &s;et me upon a&s;king him who the gen|tleman was. 'Sir,' &s;ays he, 'that unfortunate ob|ject is a man of eight thou&s;and a year e&s;tate; and, from that con&s;ideration, he expects the return of a bow from every man he meets. But I, who know him, know al&s;o that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> dying of an a&s;thma; and as (ble&s;&s;ed be God for it) I am in perfect health, I do not chu&s;e to put my&s;elf on a level with &s;uch a
<PB N="235" REF="246">
per&s;on. Health is the only valuable thing on earth; and, while I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that, I look upon my&s;elf as a much greater man than he. With all his fortune, he would rejoice to be the poor Vicar of ***, with my con&s;titution. I pull off my hat to no &s;uch per&s;ons. Believe me, he has not many months to live.</P>
<P>I made no reply to this conver&s;ation of the Vicar, and he went on thus: 'You are an old man, Sir, and, I believe, were a little fatigued with your journey la&s;t night, which I mi&s;took for infirm health, and therefore was wanting in the civilities that I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have &s;hewn you; but your conver&s;ation afterwards proved you to be a very hearty man, and I &s;aw you re&s;olved to continue &s;o by your tempe|rance; for which I honour you, and, as I told you then, &s;hall be glad of your acquaintance. It is true, you are old, and therefore my inferior; but you are healthy and temperate, and not beneath the notice of much younger men.'</P>
<P>In this manner we talked on, till we came to a hedge, where &s;ome labouring men were repairing the &s;ences. My companion acco&s;ted them with the utmo&s;t complai&s;ance and good nature: 'Ay,' &s;ays he, turning to me, 'the&s;e are men worth mixing with. You &s;ee their riches in their looks. Have you any of your lords in town that have &s;uch po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions? I know none of the&s;e lords,' &s;ays he, 'my|&s;elf, but I am told they are all &s;o &s;ickly and di&s;ea&s;ed, that a man in health would &s;corn to pull off his hat
<PB N="236" REF="247">
to them.' He then entered into a familiar con|ver&s;ation with the men, and, after throwing them &s;ix-pence to drink, pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P>There now overtook us in the lane a company of &s;port&s;men, &s;etting out for the chace. Mo&s;t of them &s;aluted the Doctor, as they pa&s;&s;ed; but he took no notice of any of them, except one, whom he &s;hook hands with over the hedge, and told him he intended taking a dinner with him the next day. 'That gentleman, &s;ays he, is worth as much health as any man in England; he hunts only by way of exerci&s;e, and never takes a leap where there is the lea&s;t dan|ger. But, as for the re&s;t, they are flying over every hedge and gate in their way, and, if they e&s;cape broken necks in the morning, they are de&s;troying them&s;elves more effectually by intemperance in the evening. No, no, the&s;e are no companions for me; I hope, with the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, to outlive a &s;core of them.'</P>
<P>We came, &s;oon after, to a little neat hou&s;e upon the road, where, the Doctor told me, lived a very agreeable widow lady, to whom he had formerly paid his addre&s;&s;es. 'She had at that time,' &s;ays he,' as large a fortune of health, as any woman in the county; but &s;he has &s;ince mortgaged it to the apothecary for &s;lops, and I have taken my leave of her. She was determined to be a widow, and &s;o married an officer, who got his head knocked off at Fontenoy. The&s;e are a &s;ort of men that I make no acquaintance with; they hold their lives on too precarious a tenure.'
<PB N="237" REF="248">
'But they are u&s;eful members of &s;ociety,' &s;aid I, 'and command our e&s;teem.' 'That may be, Sir,' returned the Doctor, 'and &s;o are the miners in our coal pits, who are every hour in danger of being buried alive. But there is a &s;ubordination of de|gree, which ought &s;trictly to be ob&s;erved; and a man in ill health, or of a dangerous profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould not think him&s;elf on a level with people of &s;ound con&s;titutions and le&s;s hazardous employments.'</P>
<P>I was determined to interrupt the Doctor no more; and he went on thus: 'You may po&s;&s;ibly think me an odd kind of a man; but I am no enemy to people of bad con&s;titutions, nor ever withhold my bounty from them, when their nece&s;&s;ities demand it; but, though I am doing them all the &s;ervices in my pow|er, I cannot con&s;ent to lower my&s;elf &s;o far as to make them my companions. It is more in the power of the phy&s;ician to confer rank, than the King; for the gifts of fortune are nothing; health is the only riches that a man ought to &s;et a value on; and, without it, all men are poor, let their e&s;tates be what they will. If I differ from the common opinion in this particular, I do al&s;o in another. The trade&s;man or mechanic, who has acquired an e&s;tate by his indu&s;try, is &s;eldom reckoned a gentleman; but it was always my &s;entiment, that a man, who makes his own con&s;titution, has more merit in him, than he that was born with it; the one is the work of chance, the other of de&s;ign; and it is for this rea&s;on that I am &s;een &s;o often with your friend; for,
<PB N="238" REF="249">
though the gout is generally an impoveri&s;hing di&s;|temper, yet temperance and regularity may in time &s;ubdue it; whereas the gentleman, who drove by us with his &s;ix hor&s;es, has an incurable a&s;thma, which renders him, with his large e&s;tate, as poor as the beggar who is dying under a hedge. The more you think of the&s;e things, the more you will be of my opinion. A poor man in health is a companion for a king; but a lord without it is a poor man indeed: And why &s;hould he expect the homage of other peo|ple, when the very meane&s;t of his dome&s;tics would refu&s;e to change places with him.'</P>
<P>My companion was &s;topped &s;hort in his harangue by our arrival at my friend's hou&s;e. We found him in good health and &s;pirits, which greatly heightened the Vicar's complai&s;ance; and, as I took care to conceal from him the complaints and infirmities of old age, I pa&s;&s;ed a very agreeable week, and was &s;o much in his good graces, that, at my departure, he pre&s;ented me with Dr. Turlington's bal&s;am, and a paper of Dr. James's powder: 'There,' &s;ays he, 'they may rob you of your money, if they plea&s;e; but, for brui&s;es and fevers, you may &s;et them at de|fiance.'</P>
<P>On my return home, I made many &s;erious re|flections on this whim&s;ical character; and, in the end, could not help wi&s;hing, that, under certain li|mitations, the &s;entiments of the Vicar were a little more in fa&s;hion. Health is certainly the riches of life; and, if men were to derive their rank from that
<PB N="239" REF="250">
alone, it would, in all probability, make them more careful to pre&s;erve it. Society might be benefited by it in another re&s;pect, as it would tend to keep complaining people at home, who are the perpetual di&s;turbers of all companies abroad.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the whim&s;ical turn which is given to this gentleman, I think his mode of e&s;ti|mating riches is exceedingly ju&s;t. With re&s;pect to what is called wealth, every per&s;on mu&s;t feel how inferior that is to a &s;ound and good con&s;titution; and even great virtues and abilities, without health, are u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety. The moral, therefore, is &s;trong and obvious, namely, that it is a duty we owe to &s;ociety, to be careful of our health.</P>

<P>YOU know, my children, we are preparing to leave the peaceful retirement of the country, a little while, for town; there to &s;ee, and be &s;een;
<PB N="240" REF="251">
there to remark the bu&s;y pur&s;uits of men, in their chace after plea&s;ure, wealth, fame, titles, or whatever el&s;e &s;eems to them mo&s;t de&s;irable. When we are there, I &s;hall endeavour, as I have before done, to turn the&s;e living le&s;&s;ons to your advantage; but as the pre&s;ent is the la&s;t conver&s;ation we &s;hall enjoy in this place till our return, I will &s;peak to you upon the &s;ubject which appears mo&s;t immediately u&s;eful; I mean <HI>Decorum,</HI> and the guarded manner in which young people, who are not &s;ufficiently aware of what are, and what are not improprieties, ought to behave.</P>
<P>Levity, though it &s;ometimes is productive of gaiety, and the agreeably &s;allies which are &s;o enli|vening to conver&s;ation, has frequently, likewi&s;e, in|curred the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s, and involved its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in irretrievable mi&s;ery and misfortune. There are two &s;orts of levity equally to be avoided; a levity of tongue, and a levity of conduct: to in|dulge in either is dangerous, for they are equally difficult to &s;ubdue, when once habit has made them familiar. The loquacious barber of Athens is a &s;trong in&s;tance of this truth.</P>
<P>A barber who kept a &s;hop at the extremity of the city of Athens, was the fir&s;t who heard of the defeat of the Athenians, in Sicily, from a &s;lave who had fled from the field of battle. This barber, impa|tient to be the man who &s;hould fir&s;t divulge the news, in&s;tantly left his &s;hop, and ran into the city, telling every body what he had heard. The&s;e di&s;agreeable
<PB N="241" REF="252">
tidings pre&s;ently occa&s;ioned a great tumult, and the people flocking to the market-place, &s;urrounded the barber, and demanded how he came to the know|ledge of this defeat; to which he could give no &s;atis|factory an&s;wer, nor produce the lea&s;t &s;hadow of proof in &s;upport of his a&s;&s;ertion, he having, in his eagerne&s;s to be the fir&s;t narrator, forgot even &s;o much as to enquire the name of the &s;lave who had told him. This exa&s;perated the people, who were very willing to believe the whole to be a lye of the barber's own invention, and, in their anger, they hurried him away, and &s;tretched him upon the rack for an incendiary. In the mean time, however, a con|firmation of the account arrived, and the people, eager to hear the particulars, ran and forgot the poor barber, leaving him upon the wheel; where he remained till the evening, when, at la&s;t, &s;omebody recollecting him, he was taken down. No &s;ooner was he relea&s;ed, than, in&s;tead of thinking about the pain he had &s;uffered, or the cure of his hurts, he began to enquire the particulars of the battle, how many were pri&s;oners, how many had e&s;caped, whe|ther the General was killed, and in what manner he died.</P>

<HEAD>YOUTHFUL LEVITY: Or the Nece&s;&s;ity of knowing your COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>TO be courteous to all, but familiar with few, is a maxim which I once de&s;pi&s;ed, as originally pro|ceeding from a mean and contracted mind, the frigid caution of weakne&s;s and timidity. A tame and in|di&s;criminate civility I imputed to a dread of the con|tempt or the petulance of others, to fears from which the wit and the gentleman are exempted by a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own dignity, by their power to repre&s;s in&s;olence, and &s;ilence ridicule; and a general &s;hyne&s;s and re&s;erve I con&s;idered as the reproach of our country, as the effect of an illiberal education, by which neither a polite addre&s;s, an ea&s;y confidence, or a general acquaintance with public life, is to be acquired. This opinion, which continued to flatter the levity and pride that produced it, was &s;trength|ened by the example of tho&s;e who&s;e manner, in the diffidence of youth, I wi&s;hed to imitate, who entered
<PB N="243" REF="254">
a mixed company with an air of ferene familiarity, acco&s;ted every man like an old acquaintance, and thought only of making &s;port for the re&s;t of any with whom their caprice &s;hould happen to be of|fended, without regard to their age, character, or condition.</P>
<P>But I now wi&s;h, that I had regulated my con|duct by the maxim which I de&s;pi&s;ed, for I &s;hould then have e&s;caped a misfortune which I can never retrieve; and the &s;en&s;e of which I am now endea|vouring to &s;u&s;pend, by relating it to you as a le&s;&s;on to others, and con&s;idering my lo&s;s of happine&s;s as an acqui&s;ition of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>While I was in France with a travelling tutor, I received a letter which acquainted me, that my father, who had been long declining, was dead; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould immediately return to England, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, which was not incon&s;iderable, though there were mort|gages upon it to near half its value.</P>
<P>When I arrived, I found a letter which the old gentleman had written and directed to me with his own hand. It contained &s;ome general rules for my conduct, and &s;ome animadver&s;ions upon his own: he took notice of the incumbrance under which he left me the paternal inheritance, which had de&s;cended through many generations, and expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire, that it might yet be tran&s;mitted intire to po&s;terity: with this view, he &s;aid, he had nego|tiated a marriage between me and the only daughter
<PB N="244" REF="255">
of his old friend, Sir George Home&s;tead of the North, an amiable young lady, who&s;e alliance would be an honour to my family, and who&s;e for|tune would much more than redeem my e&s;tate.</P>
<P>He had given the knight a faithful account of his affairs; who, after having taken &s;ome time to con|&s;ider the propo&s;al and con&s;ult his friends, con|&s;ented to the match, upon condition that his daughter and I &s;hould prove agreeable to each other, and my behaviour &s;hould confirm the character which had been given of me. My father added, that he hoped to have lived till this alliance had taken place; but as Providence had otherwi&s;e determined, he intreated, as his la&s;t reque&s;t, that as &s;oon as my affairs &s;hould be &s;ettled and decency would permit, I would make Sir George a vi&s;it, and neglect nothing to accom|pli&s;h his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was touched with the zeal and tenderne&s;s of parental affection which was then directing me to happine&s;s, after the heart that felt it had cea&s;ed to beat, and the hand that expre&s;&s;ed it was moulder|ing in the du&s;t. I had &s;een the lady, not indeed &s;ince we were children; but I remembered that her per&s;on was agreeable, and her temper &s;weet: I did not, therefore, he&s;itate a moment, whether my fa|ther's injunction &s;hould be obeyed. I proceeded to &s;ettle his affairs; I took an account of his debts and credits, vi&s;ited the tenants, recovered my u&s;ual gaiety, and at the end of about nine months &s;et out for Sir George's &s;eat in the North; having before opened
<PB N="245" REF="256">
an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, and expre&s;&s;ed my im|patience to po&s;&s;e&s;s the happine&s;s which my father had &s;o kindly &s;ecured.</P>
<P>I was better plea&s;ed to be well mounted, than to loll in a chariot, or be jumbled in a po&s;t-chai&s;e; and I knew that Sir George was an old &s;port&s;man, a plain hearty blade, who would like me better in a pair of buck&s;kin breeches on the back of a good hunter, than in a trimmed &s;uit and a gaudy equi|page: I, therefore, &s;et out on hor&s;eback with only one &s;ervant, and reached Stilton the fir&s;t night.</P>
<P>In the morning, as I was mounting, a gentle|man, who had ju&s;t got on hor&s;eback before me, ordered his &s;ervant to make enquiry concerning the road, which I happened to overhear, and told him with great familiarity, that I was going the &s;ame way, and if he plea&s;ed we would travel together: to this he con&s;ented, with as much frankne&s;s, and as little ceremony; and I &s;et forward, greatly delighted that chance had afforded me a companion.</P>
<P>We immediately entered into conver&s;ation, and I &s;oon found that he had been abroad: we extolled the roads and the policy of France, the cities, the palaces, and the villas; entered into a critical exa|mination of the mo&s;t celebrated &s;eats in England, the peculiarities of the building and &s;ituation, cro&s;s|ways, market-towns, the impo&s;ition of innkeepers, and the &s;ports of the field; topics by which we mutu|ally recommended our&s;elves to each other, as we had both opportunities to di&s;cover equal knowledge, and
<PB N="246" REF="257">
to di&s;play truth with &s;uch evidence as prevented di|ver&s;ity of opinion.</P>
<P>After we had rode about two hours, we overtook another gentleman, whom we acco&s;ted with the &s;ame familiarity that we had u&s;ed to each other; we a&s;ked him how far he was going and which way, at what rate he travelled, where he put up, and many other que&s;tions of the &s;ame kind. The gentleman, who appeared to be near fifty, received our addre&s;s with great coolne&s;s, returned &s;hort and indirect an|&s;wers to our enquiries, and, often looking with great attention on us both, &s;ometimes put forward that he might get before us, and &s;ometimes checked his hor&s;e that he might remain behind. But we were re&s;olved to di&s;appoint him; and, finding that his re&s;erve increa&s;ed, and he was vi&s;ibly di&s;plea&s;ed, we winked at each other, and determined the old put &s;hould afford us &s;ome &s;port. After we had rode together upon very ill terms more than half an hour, my companion with an air of ceremonious gravity a&s;ked him, if he knew any hou&s;e upon the road where he might be accommodated with an agreeable girl. The gentleman, who was, I believe, afraid of giving us a pretence to quarrel, did not re&s;ent this in&s;ult any otherwi&s;e than by making no reply. I then began to talk to my companion as if we had been old acquaintances, reminding him that the gen|tleman extremely re&s;embled a per&s;on whom we had once &s;een coming out of a bagnio with a certain old acquaintance of ours; and, indeed, that his pre&s;ent
<PB N="247" REF="258">
re&s;erve made me &s;u&s;pect him to be the &s;ame; but that as we were willing to forget the affair, we hoped he would be &s;o too, and that we &s;hould have the plea&s;ure of dining together at the next inn. The gentleman was &s;till &s;ilent; but as his perplexity and re&s;entment vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed, he proportionably in|crea&s;ed our entertainment, which did not, however, la&s;t long, for he &s;uddenly turned down a lane; upon which we &s;et up a hor&s;e laugh that continued till he was out of hearing, and then pur&s;uing our journey, we talked of the adventure, which afforded us conver&s;ation and merriment for the re&s;t of the day.</P>
<P>The next morning we parted, and in the evening I arrived at Home&s;tead Hall. The old knight re|ceived me with great affection, and immediately in|troduced me to his daughter, whom I now thought the fine&s;t woman I had ever &s;een. I could ea&s;ily di&s;|cover, that I was not welcome to her merely upon her father's recommendation, and I enjoyed by an|ticipation the felicity which I con&s;idered as within my reach. But the plea&s;ing &s;cene, in which I had &s;uffered my imagination to wander, &s;uddenly di&s;ap|peared as by the power of enchantment. Without any vi&s;ible motive, the behaviour of the whole family was changed, my a&s;&s;iduities to the lady were re|pre&s;&s;ed, &s;he was never to be found alone, the knight treated me with a cold civility, I was no longer a party in their vi&s;its, nor was I willingly attended even by the &s;ervants. I made many attempts to di&s;|cover
<PB N="248" REF="259">
the cau&s;e of this misfortune, but without &s;uc|ce&s;s; and one morning, when I had drawn Sir George into the garden by him&s;elf, and was about to urge him upon the &s;ubject, he prevented me by &s;ay|ing, that his promi&s;e to my father, for whom he had the highe&s;t regard, as I well knew, was conditional; that he had always re&s;olved to leave his daughter a free choice, and that &s;he had reque&s;ted him to ac|quaint me, that her affections were otherwi&s;e en|gaged, and to entreat that I would, therefore, di&s;|continue my addre&s;&s;es. My &s;urprize and concern at this declaration, were &s;uch as left me no power to reply; and I &s;aw Sir George turn from me and go into the hou&s;e, without making any attempt to &s;top him, or to obtain a further explanation. After|wards, indeed, I frequently expo&s;tulated, entreated, and complained; but, perceiving that all was inef|fectual, I took my leave, and determined that I would &s;till &s;olicit by letter; for the lady had taken &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, that I would joyfully have married her, though I had been &s;ure that her father would immediately have left all his fortune to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>I meditated on my epi&s;tolary project all the way to London, and before I had been three days in town I wrote a long letter to Sir George, in which I con|jured him, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to account for the change in his behaviour; and in&s;i&s;ted, that, on this occa&s;ion, to conceal the truth, was in the highe&s;t
<PB N="249" REF="260">
degree di&s;honourable to him&s;elf, and injurious to me.</P>
<P>To this letter, after about ten days, I received the following an&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is with great reluctance that I reveal the mo|tives of my conduct, becau&s;e they are much to your di&s;advantage. The inclo&s;ed is a letter which I re|ceived from a worthy gentleman in this county, and contains a full an&s;wer to your enquiries, which I had rather you &s;hould receive in any hand than in mine.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am your humble &s;ervant, GEO. HOMESTEAD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I immediately opened the paper inclo&s;ed, in which, with the utmo&s;t impatience, I read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;aw a per&s;on with your family ye&s;terday at the races, to whom, as I was &s;oon after informed, you intend to give your daughter. Upon this occa&s;ion, it is my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to acquaint you, that if his character is to be determined by his company, he will inevitably entail di&s;ea&s;es and beggary upon his po&s;terity, whatever be the merit of his wife, or the affluence of his fortune. He overtook me on the road from London a few weeks ago, in company with a wretch, who by their di&s;cour&s;e appeared to
<PB N="250" REF="261">
be his old and familiar acquaintance, and whom I well remember to have been brought before my friend Ju&s;tice Worthy, when I was accidentally at his hou&s;e, as the keeper of a brothel in Covent Garden. He has &s;ince won a con&s;iderable &s;um with fal&s;e dice at the ma&s;querade, for which he was obliged to leave the kingdom, and is &s;till liable to a pro&s;ecu|tion. Be a&s;&s;ured that I have perfect knowledge of both; for &s;ome incidents, which it is not nece&s;&s;ary to mention, kept me near them &s;o long on the road, that it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be mi&s;taken.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your's, &amp;c. JAMES TRUEMAN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The moment I had read this letter, the riddle was &s;olved. I knew Mr. Trueman to be the gentleman, whom I had concurred with a &s;tranger, picked up by accident, to in&s;ult without provocation on the road. I was in a moment covered with confu&s;ion; and though I was alone, could not help hiding my face with my hands. I abhorred my folly, which appeared yet more enormous every time it was re|viewed.</P>
<P>I courted the &s;ociety of a &s;tranger, and a &s;tranger I per&s;ecuted with in&s;ult: thus I a&s;&s;ociated with in|famy, and thus my a&s;&s;ociate became known. I hoped, however, to convince Sir George, that I had no knowledge of the wretch who&s;e infamy I had &s;hared, except that which I acquired from the letter of his friend. But before I had taken proper mea|&s;ures
<PB N="251" REF="262">
for my ju&s;tification, I had the mortification to hear, that the lady was married to a neighbouring gentleman, who had long made his addre&s;&s;es, and whom Sir George had before rejected in the ardor of his friend&s;hip for my father.</P>

<HEAD>LEVITY OF CONDUCT: Or the Story of FLAVILLA.</HEAD>
<P>FLAVILLA, ju&s;t as &s;he had entered her four|teenth year, was left an orphan to the care of her mother, in &s;uch circum&s;tances as di&s;appointed all the hopes which her education had encouraged. Her father, who lived in great elegance upon the &s;alary of a place at court, died &s;uddenly without having
<PB N="252" REF="263">
made any provi&s;ion for his family, except an annuity of one hundred pounds, which he had purcha&s;ed for his wife with part of her marriage portion; nor was he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any property, except the furniture of a large hou&s;e in one of the new &s;quares, an equipage, a few jewels, and &s;ome plate.</P>
<P>The greater part of the furniture and the equipage were &s;old to pay his debts; the jewels, which were not of great value, and &s;ome u&s;eful pieces of the plate, were re&s;erved; and Flavilla removed with her mother into lodgings.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this change in their circum|&s;tances, they did not immediately lo&s;e their rank. They were &s;till vi&s;ited by a numerous and polite acquaintance; and though &s;ome gratified their pride by a&s;&s;uming an appearance of pity, and rather in|&s;ulted than alleviated their di&s;tre&s;s by the whine of condolence, and a minute compari&s;on of what they had lo&s;t with what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; yet from others they were continually receiving pre&s;ents, which &s;till enabled them to live with genteel frugality; they were &s;till con&s;idered as people of fa&s;hion, and treated by tho&s;e of a lower cla&s;s with di&s;tinct re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Flavilla thus continued to move in a &s;phere to which &s;he had no claim; &s;he was remarkably tall for her age, and was celebrated not only for her beauty but her wit: the&s;e qualifications &s;he con&s;idered, not only as &s;ecuring whatever &s;he enjoyed by the favour of others, but as a pledge of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them in her own right by an advantageous marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="264">There was a fa&s;hionable levity in her carriage and di&s;cour&s;e, which her mother, who knew the danger of her &s;ituation, laboured to re&s;train, &s;ometimes with anger, and &s;ometimes with tears, but always with|out &s;ucce&s;s. Flavilla was ever ready to an&s;wer, that &s;he neither did or &s;aid any thing of which &s;he had rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed; and therefore did not know why &s;he &s;hould be re&s;trained, except in mere cour|te&s;y to envy, which it was an honour to provoke; or to &s;lander, which it was a di&s;grace to fear. In pro|portion as Flavilla was more flattered and care&s;&s;ed, the influence of her mother became le&s;s; and though &s;he always treated her with re&s;pect from a point of good breeding, yet &s;he &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;ed her maxims, and applauded her own conduct.</P>
<P>Flavilla at eighteen was a celebrated toa&s;t; and among other gay vi&s;itants who frequented her tea-table, was Clodio, a young Baronet, who had ju&s;t taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his title and e&s;tate. There were many particulars in Clodio's behaviour, which en|couraged Flavilla to hope that &s;he &s;hould obtain him for a hu&s;band; but &s;he &s;uffered his a&s;&s;iduities with &s;uch apparent plea&s;ure, and his familiarities with &s;o little re&s;erve, that he &s;oon ventured to di&s;clo&s;e his intention, and make her, what he thought, a very genteel propo&s;al of another kind: but whatever were the artifices with which it was introduced, or the terms in which it was made, Flavilla rejected it with the utmo&s;t indignation and di&s;dain. Clodio, who, notwith&s;tanding his youth, had long known and
<PB N="254" REF="265">
often practi&s;ed the arts of &s;eduction, gave way to the &s;torm, threw him&s;elf at her feet, imputed his offence to the phrenzy of his pa&s;&s;ion, flattered her pride by the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and extravagant prai&s;e, in|treated her pardon, aggravated his crime, but made no mention of atonement by marriage. This parti|cular, which Flavilla did not fail to remark, ought to have determined her to admit him no more: but her vanity and her ambition were &s;till predominant, &s;he &s;till hoped to &s;ucceed in her project. Clodio's offence was tacitly forgiven, his vi&s;its were per|mitted, his familiarities were again &s;uffered, and his hopes revived. He had long entertained an opinion that &s;he loved him, in which, however, it is pro|bable, that his own vanity and her indi&s;cretion con|curred to deceive him; but this opinion, though it implied the &s;tronge&s;t obligation to treat her with genero&s;ity and tenderne&s;s, only determined him again to attempt her ruin, as it encouraged him with a probability of &s;ucce&s;s. Having therefore re&s;olved to obtain her as a mi&s;tre&s;s, or at once to give her up, he thought he had little more to do, than to con|vince her that he had taken &s;uch a re&s;olution; ju&s;ti|fying it by &s;ome plau&s;ible &s;ophi&s;try, and to give her &s;ome time to deliberate upon a final determination. With this view he went a &s;hort journey into the country; having put a letter into her hand at part|ing, in which he acquainted her, "That he had often reflected, with inexpre&s;&s;ible regret, upon her re&s;entment of his conduct in a late in&s;tance; but
<PB N="255" REF="266">
that the delicacy and the ardour of his affection were in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles to his marriage: that where there was no liberty, there could be no happine&s;s: that he &s;hould become indifferent to the endearments of love, when they could no longer be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the officiou&s;ne&s;s of duty: that while they were happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other, it would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e they would part; and if this hap|pine&s;s &s;hould cea&s;e, it would not only en&s;ure but aggravate their mi&s;ery to be in&s;eparably united: that this event was le&s;s probable, in proportion as their cohabitation was voluntary; but that he would make &s;uch provi&s;ion for her upon the contingency, as a wife would expect upon his death."</P>
<P>Flavilla had too much under&s;tanding, as well as virtue, to deliberate a moment upon this propo&s;al. She gave immediate orders that Clodio &s;hould be ad|mitted no more. But his letter was a temptation to gratify her vanity, which &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t; &s;he &s;hewed it fir&s;t to her mother, and then to the whole circle of her female acquaintance, with all the ex|ultation of a hero who expo&s;es a vanqui&s;hed enemy at the wheels of his chariot in a triumph; &s;he con|&s;idered it as an indi&s;putable evidence of her virtue, as a reproof to all who had dared to cen&s;ure the levity of her conduct, and a licence to continue it without apology or re&s;traint.</P>
<P>It happened that Flavilla, &s;oon after this acci|dent, was &s;een in one of the boxes at the play-hou&s;e, by Mercator, a young gentleman who had ju&s;t re|turned
<PB N="256" REF="267">
from his fir&s;t voyage, as captain of a large &s;hip in the Levant trade, which had been purcha&s;ed for him by his father, who&s;e fortune enabled him to make a genteel provi&s;ion for five &s;ons, of whom Mercator was the younge&s;t, and who expected to &s;hare his e&s;tate, which was per&s;onal, in equal pro|portions at his death.</P>
<P>Mercator was captivated with her beauty, but di&s;couraged by the &s;plendor of her appearance, and the rank of her company. He was urged, rather by curio&s;ity than hope, to enquire who &s;he was; and he gained &s;uch a knowledge of her circum|&s;tances, as relieved him from de&s;pair.</P>
<P>As he knew not how to get admi&s;&s;ion to her com|pany, and had no de&s;ign upon her virtue, he wrote in the fir&s;t ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion to her mother; giv|ing a faithful account of his fortune and dependence, and entreating that he might be permitted to vi&s;it Flavilla as a candidate for her affection. The lady, after having made &s;ome enquiries, by which the ac|count that Mercator had given her was confirmed, &s;ent him an invitation, and received his fir&s;t vi&s;it alone. She told him, that as Flavilla had no for|tune, and as a con&s;iderable part of his own was de|pendent upon his father's will, he ought, therefore, to obtain his con&s;ent, before any other &s;tep was taken. To this coun&s;el, &s;o &s;alutary, Mercator was he&s;itating what to reply, when Flavilla came in, an accident which he was now only &s;olicitous to improve. Fla|villa was not di&s;plea&s;ed either with his per&s;on or his
<PB N="257" REF="268">
addre&s;s. The frankne&s;s and gaiety of her di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon made him forget that he was a &s;tranger. A conver&s;ation commenced, during which they became yet more plea&s;ed with each other; and having thus &s;urmounted the difficulty of a fir&s;t vi&s;it, he thought no more of the mother, as he believed her au&s;pices were not nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>His vi&s;its were often repeated, and he became every hour more impatient of delay. A thought of his father would now and then, indeed, intervene; but being determined to gratify his wi&s;hes at all events, he concluded with a &s;agacity almo&s;t univer&s;al on the&s;e occa&s;ions, that of two evils, to marry without his con&s;ent, was le&s;s than to marry again&s;t it; and one evening, after the lovers had &s;pent the after|noon by them&s;elves, they went out in a kind of fro|lic, which Mercator had propo&s;ed in the vehemence of his pa&s;&s;ion, and to which Flavilla had con&s;ented in the giddine&s;s of her indi&s;cretion, and were mar|ried at May-Fair chapel.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t interval of recollection after this pre|cipitate &s;tep, Mercator con&s;idered, that he ought to be the fir&s;t to acquaint his father of the new alli|ance which had been made in his family: but as he had not fortitude enough to do it in per&s;on, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed it in the be&s;t terms he could conceive by a letter; and reque&s;ted that he might be permitted to pre&s;ent his wife for the parental benediction, which alone was wanting to complete his felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="269">The old gentleman, who&s;e character I cannot better expre&s;s than in the fa&s;hionable phra&s;e which has been contrived to palliate fal&s;e principles and di&s;&s;olute manners, had been <HI>a gay man,</HI> and was well acquainted with the town. He had often heard Flavilla toa&s;ted by rakes of quality, and had often &s;een her at public places. Her beauty and her de|pendence, the gaiety of her dre&s;s, the multitude of her admirers, the levity of her conduct, and all the circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation, had concurred to render her character &s;u&s;pected; and he was di&s;po&s;ed to judge of it with yet le&s;s charity, when, as &s;he had offended him by marrying his &s;on, whom he con&s;idered as di&s;graced and impoveri&s;hed, and who&s;e misfortune, as it was irretrievable, he re&s;olved not to alleviate, but increa&s;e: a re&s;olution by which fathers, who have fooli&s;h and di&s;obedient &s;ons, u&s;ually di&s;play their own kindne&s;s and wi&s;dom. As &s;oon as he read Mercator's letter, he execrated him for a fool, who had been gulled by the artifices of a loo&s;e woman, to &s;creen her from public infamy, by fathering her children, and &s;ecuring her from a pri&s;on by appro|priating her debts. In his an&s;wer, which he wrote only to gratify his re&s;entment, he told him, that "if he had taken Flavilla into keeping, he would have overlooked it; and if her extravagance had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, he would have &s;atisfied his creditors; but that his marriage was not to be forgiven; that he &s;hould never have a &s;hilling of his money; and that he was determined to &s;ee him no more."</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="270">Mercator, who was more provoked by this out|rage than grieved at his lo&s;s, di&s;dained to reply; and believing that <HI>he</HI> had now mo&s;t rea&s;on to be of|fended, could not be per&s;uaded to &s;olicit a reconci|liation.</P>
<P>He hired a genteel apartment for his wife of an uphol&s;terer, who, with a view to let lodgings, had taken and furni&s;hed a large hou&s;e, near Leice&s;ter-fields; and in about two months, he left her, and made another voyage.</P>
<P>He had received vi&s;its of congratulation from her numerous acquaintance, and had returned them as a pledge of his de&s;ire that they &s;hould be repeated. But a remembrance of the gay multitude, which, while he was at home, had flattered his vanity, as &s;oon as he was ab&s;ent, alarmed his &s;u&s;picions. He had, indeed, no particular cau&s;e of jealou&s;y; but his anxiety aro&s;e merely from a &s;en&s;e of the temptations to which &s;he was expo&s;ed, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of his &s;uperintending her conduct.</P>
<P>In the mean time Flavilla continued to flutter round the &s;ame giddy circle in which &s;he had &s;hone &s;o long; the number of her vi&s;itants rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed; the gentlemen attended with yet greater a&s;&s;iduity; and &s;he continued to encourage their civilities by the &s;ame indi&s;creet familiarity: She was one night at the ma&s;querade, another night at an opera; &s;ometimes at a route; &s;ometimes ram|bling in parties of plea&s;ure in &s;hort excur&s;ions from
<PB N="260" REF="271">
town; &s;he came home at midnight, in the morning, and &s;ometimes &s;he was ab&s;ent &s;everal nights together.</P>
<P>This conduct was the cau&s;e of much &s;peculation and unea&s;ine&s;s to the good man and woman of the hou&s;e. At fir&s;t they &s;u&s;pected that Flavilla was no better than a woman of plea&s;ure; and that the per&s;on who had hired the lodgings for her as his wife, and had di&s;appeared upon pretence of a voyage to &s;ea, had been employed to impo&s;e upon them, by con|cealing her character, in order to obtain &s;uch accom|modations for her as &s;he could not &s;o ea&s;ily have procured had it been known: But as the&s;e &s;u&s;picions made them watchful and inqui&s;itive, they &s;oon di&s;|covered, that many ladies by whom &s;he was vi&s;ited, were of good character and fa&s;hion. Her conduct, however, &s;uppo&s;ing her to be a wife, was &s;till inex|cu&s;able, and &s;till endangered their credit and &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence: hints were often dropped by the neighbours to the di&s;advantage of her character; and an elderly maiden lady, who lodged in the &s;econd floor, had given warning: the family was di&s;turbed at all hours in the night, and the door was crouded all day with me&s;&s;engers and vi&s;itants to Flavilla.</P>
<P>One day, therefore, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e took an opportunity to remon&s;trate, though in the mo&s;t di&s;tant and re&s;pectful terms, and with the utmo&s;t diffidence and caution. She told Flavilla, "That &s;he was a fine young lady, that her hu&s;band was abroad, that &s;he kept a great deal of company, and that the world was cen&s;orious: &s;he wi&s;hed that le&s;s
<PB N="261" REF="272">
occa&s;ion for &s;candal was given; and hoped to be excu&s;ed the liberty &s;he had taken. Flavilla might be ruined by tho&s;e &s;landers which could have no influ|ence upon the great, and which, therefore, the great were not &s;olicitous to avoid."</P>
<P>This addre&s;s, however ambiguous, and however gentle, was ea&s;ily under&s;tood, and fiercely re&s;ented. Flavilla, proud of her virtue, and impatient of con|troul, would have de&s;pi&s;ed the coun&s;el of a philo&s;o|pher, if it had implied an impeachment of her con|duct: before a per&s;on &s;o much her inferior, there|fore, &s;he was under no re&s;traint; &s;he an&s;wered with a mixture of contempt and indignation, "That tho&s;e only who did not know her, would dare to take any liberty with her character; and warned her to pro|pagate no &s;candalous report at her peril." Flavilla immediately ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e departed without reply, though &s;he was &s;carce le&s;s offended than her lodger, and from that moment &s;he determined, when Mercator returned, to give warning.</P>
<P>Mercator's voyage was pro&s;perous, and, after an ab&s;ence of about ten months, he came back. The woman, to whom her hu&s;band had left the whole ma|nagement of the lodgings, and who per&s;i&s;ted in her purpo&s;e, &s;oon found an opportunity to put it in exe|cution. Mercator, as his part of the contract had been punctually fulfilled, thought he had &s;ome cau&s;e to be offended, and in&s;i&s;ted to know her rea&s;ons for compelling him to leave her hou&s;e. The&s;e &s;he was

very unwilling to give; and as he perceived that &s;he evaded his que&s;tion, he became more &s;olicitous to obtain an an&s;wer. After much he&s;itation, which, perhaps, had a wor&s;e effect than any tale which ma|lice could have invented, &s;he told him, that "The lady kept a great deal of company, and often &s;taid out very late; that &s;he had always been u&s;ed to quiet and regularity; and was determined to let her apart|ment to &s;ome per&s;on in a more private &s;tation."</P>
<P>At this account Mercator changed countenance; for he inferred from it ju&s;t as much more than truth as he believed it to be le&s;s. After &s;ome moments of &s;u&s;pence, he conjured her to conceal nothing from him, with an emotion which convinced her that &s;he had already &s;aid too much. She then a&s;&s;ured him, "That he had no rea&s;on to be alarmed; for that &s;he had no exception to his lady, but tho&s;e gaieties which her &s;tation and the fa&s;hion &s;ufficiently autho|rized." Mercator's &s;u&s;picions, however, were not wholly removed; and he began to think he had found a confidante whom it would be his intere&s;t to tru&s;t: he, therefore, in the weakne&s;s of jealou&s;y, confe&s;&s;ed, that, "He had &s;ome doubts concerning his wife, which it was of the utmo&s;t importance to his honour, and his peace to have re&s;olved: he en|treated her that he might continue in the apart|ment another year; that, as he &s;hould again leave the kingdom in a &s;hort time, &s;he would &s;uffer no in|cident, which might confirm either his hopes or his fears, to e&s;cape her notice in his ab&s;ence; and that
<PB N="263" REF="274">
at his return &s;he would give him &s;uch an account as would at lea&s;t deliver him from the torment of &s;u&s;|pence, and determine his future conduct."</P>
<P>Mercator, however, concealed his &s;u&s;picions from his wife; and, indeed, in her pre&s;ence they were forgotten. Her manner of life he began &s;eriou&s;ly to di&s;approve; but being well acquainted with her temper, in which great &s;weetne&s;s was blended with a high &s;pirit, he would not embitter the plea&s;ure of a &s;hort &s;tay by altercation, chiding, and tears: but when her mind was melted into tenderne&s;s at his de|parture, he cla&s;ped her in an extacy of fondne&s;s to his bo&s;om, and intreated her to behave with re&s;erve and circum&s;pection; "Becau&s;e," &s;aid he, "I know that my father keeps a watchful eye upon your con|duct, which may, therefore, confirm or remove his di&s;plea&s;ure, and either intercept or be&s;tow &s;uch an increa&s;e of our fortune as will prevent the pangs of &s;eparation, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e &s;o often return, and in a &s;hort time unite us to part no more." To this caution &s;he had then no power to reply; and they parted with mutual prote&s;tations of unal|terable love.</P>
<P>Flavilla, &s;oon after &s;he was thus left in a &s;ort of widowhood a &s;econd time, found her&s;elf pregnant; and within &s;omewhat le&s;s than eight months after Mercator's return from his fir&s;t voyage, &s;he hap|pened to &s;tumble as &s;he was going up &s;tairs, and being immediately taken ill, was brought to bed be|fore the next morning.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="275">It was now nece&s;&s;ary that the vigils of whi&s;t and the tumults of balls and vi&s;its &s;hould, for a while, be &s;u&s;pended; and in this interval of languor and retirement Flavilla fir&s;t became thoughtful. She often reflected upon Mercator's caution when they la&s;t parted, which had made an indelible impre&s;&s;ion upon her mind, though it had produced no alteration in her conduct: notwith&s;tanding the manner in which it was expre&s;&s;ed, and the rea&s;on upon which it was founded, &s;he began to fear that it might have been &s;ecretly prompted by jealou&s;y.&mdash;The birth, therefore, of her fir&s;t child in his ab&s;ence, at a time &s;o premature, was an accident which greatly alarm|ed her: but there was yet another, for which it was &s;till le&s;s in her power to account, and which, there|fore, alarmed her &s;till more.</P>
<P>It happened that &s;ome civilities which &s;he receiv|ed from a lady who &s;at next her at an opera, and whom &s;he had never &s;een before, introduced a con|ver&s;ation which &s;o much delighted her, that &s;he gave her a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to vi&s;it her: this in|vitation was accepted, and in a few days the vi&s;it was paid. Flavilla was not le&s;s plea&s;ed at the &s;econd interview, than &s;he had been at the fir&s;t; and with|out making any other enquiry concerning the lady than where &s;he lived, took the fir&s;t opportunity to wait upon her. The apartment in which &s;he was received was the ground floor of an elegant hou&s;e, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from St. James's palace. It hap|pened that Flavilla was placed near the window;
<PB N="265" REF="276">
and a party of the hor&s;e-guards riding through the &s;treets, &s;he expected to &s;ee &s;ome of the royal family, and ha&s;tily threw up the &s;a&s;h. A gentleman who was pa&s;&s;ing by at the &s;ame in&s;tant, turned about at the noi&s;e of the window, and Flavilla no &s;ooner &s;aw his face than &s;he knew him to be the father of Mer|cator. After looking fir&s;t &s;teadfa&s;tly at her, and then glancing his eye at the lady whom &s;he was vi&s;iting, he affected a contemptuous &s;neer, and went on. Flavilla, who had been thrown into &s;ome confu&s;ion, by the &s;udden and unexpected &s;ight of a per&s;on, who, &s;he knew, con&s;idered her as the di&s;grace of his fa|mily, and the ruin of his child, now changed coun|tenance, and ha&s;tily retired to another part of the room: &s;he was touched both with grief and anger at this &s;ilent in&s;ult, of which, however, &s;he did not then &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e. It is, indeed, probable, that the father of Mercator would no where have looked upon her with complacency; but as &s;oon as he &s;aw her companion, he recollected that &s;he was the fa|vourite mi&s;tre&s;s of an old courtier, and that this was the hou&s;e in which he kept her in great &s;plendor. It happened that Flavilla, &s;oon after this accident, di&s;covered the character of her new acquaintance; and never remembered by whom &s;he had been &s;een in her company, without the utmo&s;t regret and ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>She now re&s;olved to move in a le&s;s circle, and with more circum&s;pection. In the mean time her little boy grew very fa&s;t; and it could no longer be
<PB N="266" REF="277">
known by his appearance, that he had been born too &s;oon. His mother frequently gazed on him with overflowing eyes; and though her plea&s;ures were now become dome&s;tic, yet &s;he feared le&s;t that which had produced, &s;hould de&s;troy them. After much de|liberation, &s;he determined that &s;he would conceal the child's age from its father; believing it prudent to pre|vent a &s;u&s;picion, which, however ill founded, it might be difficult to remove, as her ju&s;tification would de|pend wholly upon the te&s;timony of her dependents; and her mother's and her own would nece&s;&s;arily be|come doubtful, when every one would have rea&s;on to conclude, that it would &s;till have been the &s;ame, &s;uppo&s;ing the contrary to have been true.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of Flavilla's mind, and her little boy was &s;ix months old, when Mercator re|turned. She received him with joy indeed, but it was mixed with a vi&s;ible confu&s;ion; their meeting was more tender, but on her part le&s;s chearful; &s;he &s;miled with inexpre&s;&s;ible complacency, but at the &s;ame time the tears gu&s;hed from her eyes, and &s;he was &s;eized with an univer&s;al tremor. Mercator caught the infection; and care&s;&s;ed fir&s;t his Flavilla, and then his boy, with an exce&s;s of fondne&s;s and delight that before he had never expre&s;&s;ed. The &s;ight of the child made him more than ever wi&s;h a reconciliation with his father; and having heard, on his fir&s;t landing, that he was dangerou&s;ly ill, he determined to attempt, immediately, to &s;ee him; promi&s;ing that he would return to &s;upper. He had,
<PB N="267" REF="278">
in the mid&s;t of his care&s;&s;es, more than once enquired the age of his &s;on, but the que&s;tion had been always evaded; of which, however, he took no notice, nor did it produce any &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>He was now ha&s;ting to enquire after his father; but as he pa&s;&s;ed through the hall, he was officiou&s;ly laid hold of by his landlady. He was not much di&s;|po&s;ed to enquire how &s;he had fulfilled his charge; but perceiving by her looks that &s;he had &s;omething to communicate, which, at lea&s;t in her own opinion, was of importance, he &s;uffered her to take him into her parlour. She immediately &s;hut the door, and reminded him, that &s;he had undertaken an office with reluctance, which he had pre&s;&s;ed upon her; and that &s;he had done nothing in it to which he had not bound her by a promi&s;e; that &s;he was extremely &s;orry to communicate her di&s;coveries; but that he was a worthy gentleman, and, indeed, ought to know them. She then told him, "That the child was born within le&s;s than eight months after his la&s;t re|turn from abroad; that it was &s;aid to have come be|fore its time, but that having pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee it, &s;he was refu&s;ed." This, indeed, was true, and con|firmed the good woman in her &s;u&s;picion; for Fla|villa, who had &s;till re&s;ented the freedom which &s;he had taken in her remon&s;trance, had kept her at a great di&s;tance; and the &s;ervants, to gratify their mi&s;tre&s;s, treated her with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence and contempt.</P>
<P>At this relation Mercator turned pale. He now recollected that his que&s;tion concerning the child's
<PB N="266" REF="279">

<PB N="267" REF="280">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="268" REF="281">
birth had been evaded: and concluded, that he had been &s;hedding tears of tenderne&s;s and joy over a faithle&s;s wife, and an illegitimate child, who had robbed him of his patrimony, his honour and his peace. He &s;tarted up with the furious wildne&s;s of &s;udden phrenzy; but &s;he, with great difficulty, pre|vailed upon him not to leave the room. He &s;at down and remained &s;ome time motionle&s;s, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and his hands locked in each other. In proportion as he believed his wife to be guilty, his tenderne&s;s for his father revived: and he re&s;olved, with yet greater zeal, to pro&s;ecute his purpo&s;e of immediately attempting a reconciliation.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, he went to the hou&s;e, where he learned that his father had died early in the morning, and that his relations were then a&s;&s;embled to read his will. Fulvius, a brother of Mercator's mother, with whom he had always been a favourite, happening to pa&s;s from one room to another, heard his voice. He acco&s;ted him with great ardour of friend&s;hip; and &s;oothing him with expre&s;&s;ions of condolence and affection, in&s;i&s;ted to introduce him to the company. Mercator tacitly con&s;ented; he was received at lea&s;t with civility by his brother, and &s;itting down among them, the will was read. He &s;eemed to li&s;ten like the re&s;t; but was, indeed, mu&s;ing over the &s;tory which he had ju&s;t heard, and lo&s;t in the &s;peculation of his own wretchedne&s;s. He awakened as from a dream, when the voice of the per&s;on who had been reading was &s;u&s;pended; and finding that he could no longer con|tain
<PB N="269" REF="282">
him&s;elf, he &s;tarted up, and would have left the company.</P>
<P>Of the will which had been read before him, he knew nothing; but his uncle believing that he was moved with grief and re&s;entment at the manner in which he had been mentioned in it, and the beque&s;t only of a &s;hilling, took him into another room; and, to apologize for his father's unkindne&s;s, told him, "that the re&s;entment which he expre&s;&s;ed at his mar|riage, was every day increa&s;ed by the conduct of his wife, who&s;e character was now become infamous, for that &s;he had been &s;een at the lodgings of a cer|tain woman of bad character, with whom &s;he ap|peared to be well acquainted." This account threw Mercator into another agony; from which he was, however, at length recovered by his uncle, who, as the only expedient by which he could retrieve his misfortune, and &s;ooth his di&s;tre&s;s, propo&s;ed that he &s;hould no more return to his lodgings, but go home with him; that he would him&s;elf take &s;uch mea&s;ures with his wife, as would &s;carce fail of inducing her to accept a &s;eparate maintenance, to a&s;&s;ume another name, and trouble him no more. Mercator, in the bitterne&s;s of his affliction, con&s;ented to his propo&s;al, and they went away together.</P>
<P>Mercator, in the mean time, was expected by Flavilla with the mo&s;t tender impatience. She had put her little boy to bed, and decorated a &s;mall room in which they had u&s;ed to &s;up, and which &s;he had &s;hut up in his ab&s;ence; &s;he counted the moments as they pa&s;&s;ed, and li&s;tened to every carriage and every
<PB N="270" REF="283">
&s;tep that &s;he heard. Supper was now ready: her impatience was increa&s;ed; terror was at length mingled with regret, and her fondne&s;s was only bu&s;ied to afflict her; &s;he wi&s;hed, &s;he feared, &s;he ac|cu&s;ed, &s;he apologized, and &s;he wept. In the height of the&s;e eager expectations and this tender di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he received a billet which Mercator had been per|&s;uaded by his uncle to write, in which he upbraided her in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, with abu&s;ing his confi|dence; "of this, he &s;aid, he had now obtained &s;uf|ficient proof to do ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, and was deter|mined to &s;ee her no more."</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who&s;e hearts have not already acquainted them with the agony which &s;eized Flavilla upon the &s;ight of this billet, all attempts to de&s;cribe it would be not only ineffectual but ab&s;urd. Having pa&s;&s;ed the night without &s;leep, and the next day without food, di&s;appointed in every attempt to di&s;cover what was become of Mercator, and doubting, if &s;he were to find him, whether it would be po&s;&s;ible to convince him of her innocence; this violent agita|tion of her mind, produced a &s;low fever, which, before &s;he con&s;idered it as a di&s;ea&s;e, &s;he communi|cated to the child while &s;he cheri&s;hed it at her bo&s;om, and wept over it, as an orphan who&s;e life &s;he was &s;u&s;taining with her own.</P>
<P>After Mercator had been ab&s;ent about ten days, his uncle, who per&s;uaded him to accompany &s;ome friends to a country &s;eat, at the di&s;tance of near &s;ixty miles, went to his lodgings in order to di&s;|charge the rent, and try what terms he could make
<PB N="271" REF="284">
with Flavilla, whom he hoped to intimidate with threats of a divorce; but when he came, he found Flavilla &s;inking very fa&s;t under her di&s;ea&s;e, and the child dead. The woman of the hou&s;e, into who&s;e hands &s;he had ju&s;t put her watch, and &s;ome ornaments as a &s;ecurity for her rent, was &s;o touched with her di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;o firmly per&s;uaded of her in|nocence by the manner in which &s;he had addre&s;&s;ed her, and the calm &s;olemnity with which &s;he ab&s;olved tho&s;e by whom &s;he had been traduced, that as &s;oon as &s;he had di&s;covered Fulvius's bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he threw her|&s;elf on her knees, and intreated, that if he knew where Mercator was to be found, he would urge him to return, that, if po&s;&s;ible, the life of Flavilla might be pre&s;erved, and the happine&s;s of both be re&s;tored by her ju&s;tification. Fulvius, who &s;till &s;u&s;pected appearances, or at lea&s;t was in doubt of the cau&s;e that had produced them, would not di&s;|cover his nephew; but after much entreaty and ex|po&s;tulation, at la&s;t engaged upon his honour for the conveyance of a letter. The woman as &s;oon as &s;he obtained his promi&s;e, ran up and communicated it to Flavilla; who, when &s;he had recovered from the &s;urprize and tumult which it occa&s;ioned, was &s;upported in her bed, and in about half an hour, after many efforts, and many intervals, wrote a &s;hort billet, which was &s;ealed and put into the hands of Fulvius.</P>
<P>Fulvius immediately inclo&s;ed and di&s;patched it by the po&s;t, re&s;olving that in a que&s;tion &s;o doubtful and of &s;uch importance, he would no further inter|po&s;e.
<PB N="272" REF="285">
Mercator, who the moment he ca&s;t his eye upon the letter, knew both the hand and &s;eal; after pau&s;ing a few moments in &s;u&s;pence, at length tore it, open, and read the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Such has been my folly, that, perhaps, I &s;hould not be acquitted of guilt in any circum&s;tances, but tho&s;e in which I write. I do not, therefore, but for your &s;ake, wi&s;h them otherwi&s;e than they are. The dear infant, who&s;e birth has undone me, now lies dead at my &s;ide, a victim to My indi&s;cretion and Your re&s;entment. I am &s;carce able to guide my pen. But I mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreat to &s;ee you, that you may at lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction to hear me atte&s;t my in|nocence with the la&s;t &s;igh, and &s;eal our reconciliation on my lips, while they are yet &s;en&s;ible of the im|pre&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Mercator, whom an earthquake would le&s;s have affected than this letter, felt all his &s;en&s;ibility revive in a moment, and reflected with unalterable angui&s;h upon the ra&s;hne&s;s of his re&s;entment. At the thought of his di&s;tance from London, he &s;tarted as at a dag|ger in his heart: he lifted up his eyes to heaven, with a look that expre&s;&s;ed at once an accu&s;ation of him&s;elf, and a petition for her; and then ru&s;hing out of the hou&s;e, without taking leave, or ordering a &s;ervant to attend him, he took po&s;t-hor&s;es at a neighbouring inn, and in le&s;s than &s;ix hours was in Leice&s;ter-fields. But notwith&s;tanding his &s;peed, he arrived too late; Flavilla had &s;uffered the la&s;t agony, and her eyes could behold him no more. Grief and di&s;appointment, remor&s;e and de&s;pair now totally &s;ub|verted
<PB N="273" REF="286">
his rea&s;on. It became nece&s;&s;ary to remove him by force from the body; and, after a confinement of two years, he died di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>May every woman on who&s;e memory compa&s;&s;ion &s;hall record the&s;e events, tremble to a&s;&s;ume the le|vity of Flavilla; perhaps, it is not in the power of any man, in Mercator's circum&s;tances, to be le&s;s jealous than Mercator.</P>

You have as yet contracted no partialities, are entirely ignorant of party di&s;tinctions, and look with a perfect indifference on all human &s;plendor.

As you advance farther in life, this philo&s;o|phical temper will, by degrees, wear off: the fir&s;t object of your admiration will probably be a candle; and thence, (as we all of us do) you will contract a ta&s;te for the gaudy and the glaring, without making one moral reflection upon the danger of &s;uch fal&s;e admiration, as leads people, many a time, to burn their fingers. You will then begin to &s;hew great partiality for &s;ome very good aunts, who will contri|bute all they can towards &s;poiling you; but you will be equally fond of an excellent mamma, who
<PB N="275" REF="288">
will teach you, by her example, all &s;orts of good qualities; only let me warn you of one thing, my dear, and that is, do not learn of her to have &s;uch an immoderate love of home; for it is quite contrary to all the privileges of this polite age; nor to give up &s;o entirely all tho&s;e pretty graces of whim, flutter, and affectation, which &s;o many charitable poets have declared to be the prerogative of our &s;ex: ah! my poor cou&s;in, to what purpo&s;e will you boa&s;t this pre|rogative, when your nur&s;e tells you, with a pious care, to &s;ow the &s;eeds of jealou&s;y and emulation as early as po&s;&s;ible, that you have a fine little brother come to put your no&s;e out of joint.

<P>I have now, my dear children, only a few words to add. We are going, for a little while, from a happy retirement, where truth and peace and inno|cence delight to dwell, into the regions of plea&s;ure, folly, and ambition. Let not your eyes be daz|zled with fal&s;e glare, nor your hearts tempted with imaginary delights. Drink not too deep at the fa&s;cinating fountain of plea&s;ure, left you &s;hould either be inebriated or &s;urfeited. It is true, your pre&s;ent danger is not very great; you will have faithful and intere&s;ted directors, who&s;e care and cau|tion will counterbalance the impetuous &s;allies of youthful imagination; but beware of contracting a love for fancied plea&s;ures, which you will behold &s;o many pur&s;uing with thoughtle&s;s impetuo&s;ity, and who &s;top not in their career, till &s;uddendly impeded by poverty, di&s;ea&s;e, or un&s;u&s;pected ruin. Remember the &s;erene, the chearful joys you have &s;o often been partakers of in this place, and let not your pa&s;&s;ions hurry you away from the calm and permanent con|tent, which rea&s;on and reflection never fail to give. When you go into public, be willing to be plea&s;ed, but not infatuated. In &s;hort, my children, remem|ber the examples you have &s;o often read of in this happy room: think on the inevitable con&s;equences of good and bad, of wi&s;e and fooli&s;h conduct: forget not how deeply intere&s;ted are the mother who has done and &s;uffered &s;o much for you, and the father who&s;e labours have been uncea&s;ing to make you truly vir|tuous and beneficent members of &s;ociety&mdash;forget not,

I &s;ay, my dear, dear children, how much it is in your power to heap ble&s;&s;ings or cur&s;es, to render happy or mi&s;erable, parents, of who&s;e dear and tender affection you have had &s;o many and &s;uch indi&s;putable proofs. You will your&s;elves, I hope, hereafter, be|come happy parents; you will then know the force of parental anxieties, and parental joys. I cannot de&s;cribe them; endeavour to imagine what they are from the following &s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>PARENTAL FEELINGS: Or the ABENAKEE INDIAN.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the la&s;t war in America, a band of &s;avages having &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated a party of the Engli&s;h, &s;uch of tho&s;e who were not actually killed on the &s;pot, had very little chance of getting away from enemies who were much quicker of foot than they, and who, pur&s;uing them with unrelenting fury, u&s;ed tho&s;e whom they overtook with a barbarity, even in tho&s;e countries, almo&s;t without example.</P>
<P>A young Engli&s;h officer, pre&s;&s;ed by two &s;avages who were making at him with uplifted hatchets, without the lea&s;t hope of e&s;caping death, thought of nothing but &s;elling his life as dear as he could. At the in&s;tant, an old &s;avage, armed with his bow, drew near him, in order to pierce him with the arrow; when taking aim at him, all on a &s;udden drops his point, and runs to throw him&s;elf between the young Engli&s;hman and the two Barbarians, who were going to ma&s;&s;acre him. The&s;e drew back out of re&s;pect to the motions of the old man, who, with
<PB N="278" REF="291">
&s;igns of peace, took the officer by the hand, after removing his apprehen&s;ions by friendly ge&s;tures, and carried him home with him to his hut. There he treated him with humanity and gentlene&s;s, more like his companion than his &s;lave. He taught him the Abenakee language, and the coar&s;e arts in u&s;e among tho&s;e people, and they lived well &s;atisfied with each other. One only point of the old man's deport|ment gave the young officer unea&s;ine&s;s; he fre|quently ob&s;erved the &s;avage fixing his eyes upon him, and, after looking long and &s;teadfa&s;tly at him, &s;hed|ding tears.</P>
<P>On the return of &s;pring, the Abenakees took the field again, and proceeded in que&s;t of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The old man, who had &s;till vigour enough to bear the fatigues of war, went along with his coun|trymen; not forgetting to take his pri&s;oner with him. They made a march of above two hundred leagues, through the trackle&s;s wilds and fore&s;ts of that country, till at length they came within view of a plain in which they di&s;covered an Engli&s;h camp. This the old man &s;hewed to his young companion, at the &s;ame time attentively eyeing him, and mark|ing his countenance; "There (&s;ays he) are thy brothers waiting to give us battle. What &s;aye&s;t thou? I pre&s;erved thee from death. I have taught thee to build canoes; to make bows and arrows; to catch the deer of the fore&s;t; to wield the hatchet; and our whole art of war. What wa&s;t thou when I took thee home to my dwelling? Thy hands were as the hands of a mere child, they could &s;erve thee
<PB N="279" REF="292">
but little for thy defence, and yet le&s;s for providing thee means of &s;u&s;tenance. Thy &s;oul was in the dark: thou wert a &s;tranger to all nece&s;&s;ary know|ledge. To me thou owe&s;t life&mdash;the means of life&mdash; every thing. Could&s;t thou then be ungrateful enough to go over to join thy countrymen, and to lift the hatchet again&s;t us?"</P>
<P>The young Engli&s;hman an&s;wered, that he could not but feel a ju&s;t repugnance to carrying arms again&s;t tho&s;e of his own nation, but that he would never turn them again&s;t the Abenakees, whom, &s;o long as he &s;hould live, he would con&s;ider as his brothers.</P>
<P>At this the dejected &s;avage hung his head, and lifting up his hands covered his face with them, in a deep meditation. After remaining &s;ome time in this attitude, he looked earne&s;tly at the Engli&s;h officer, and &s;aid to him with a mixture of grief and tenderne&s;s, "Ha&s;t thou a father?"&mdash;"He was alive, an&s;wered the young man, when I left my country."&mdash;"Oh, unhappy man!" &s;aid the &s;avage. &mdash;After a moment's pau&s;e, adding, "Do&s;t thou not know that I too was once a father?&mdash;Alas! I am no longer one. No: I am no longer a father! I &s;aw my &s;on fall. He fought by my &s;ide: I &s;aw him die like a man, covered with wounds as he fell! But I revenged him."</P>
<P>He pronounced the&s;e words with the mo&s;t pathetic empha&s;is, and &s;huddered; his brea&s;t heaved with pain, and he was choaked with inward groans, which he endeavoured to &s;tifle. His eyes looked wild, but
<PB N="280" REF="293" MS="y">
no tear fell. By degrees the violence of his agita|tions cea&s;ed, and he grew calm. Turning towards the ea&s;t, he pointed to the ri&s;ing &s;un, and &s;aid, "See&s;t thou yon beauteous luminary, that &s;un in all its &s;plendor? Does the &s;ight of it afford thee plea|&s;ure?"&mdash;"Undoubtedly, an&s;wered the officer, who can behold &s;o fine a &s;ky without delight?"&mdash;"And yet to me, &s;aid the &s;avage, it no longer affords any!" Then ca&s;ting his eye on a bu&s;h in full flower, "See! &s;aid he, young man, doth not that gay appearance of flowers give thee a &s;ort of joy to look at?" "It does," replied the officer. "And yet, &s;aid the old man, it delighteth not me!" adding, with impetu|o&s;ity, "depart&mdash;ha&s;te,&mdash;fly to yon camp of thy friends. Get thee home to thy Father, that he may &s;till behold with plea&s;ure the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, and the flowers of the &s;pring."</P>
