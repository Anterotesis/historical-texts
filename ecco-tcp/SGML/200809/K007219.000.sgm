<P>As certain Dramatic Writers po&s;tpone the Publica|tion of their Pieces, intimidated by every mean mercenary Momus of the day, called a Critic, the Printer, for the pre&s;ent, thus pre&s;umes to pre&s;ent the Public with corrected Copies of &s;uch Plays, as, having pa&s;&s;ed the Theatrical Odeal, have &s;o long been confined to the bare Repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Nor does he, by this accommodation, mean to injure the Authors, but rather would prepare the way for their approach to the Temple of Fame. For their en|couragement, He a&s;&s;ures &s;uch Candidates, that the howling sons of Cerberus are ea&s;ily &s;oothed by a <HI>&s;op,</HI> and that the mu&s;ic of <HI>money</HI> will readily lull the mo&s;t watchful de&s;cendant of <HI>Argus.</HI></P>
<P>Several of the Printer's Co-temporaries having forced into the world depraved and mutilated Copies of the Unpubli&s;hed Plays, he has fallen upon an ex|pedient of procuring them as Correct as they stand on the Prompter's Book, and repre&s;ented at the Royal Theatres. With regard to the following <HI>Opera,</HI> he only ob&s;erves, that others with him have "run in the race to entertain the Public, but he alone has obtained the PRIZE."</P>
