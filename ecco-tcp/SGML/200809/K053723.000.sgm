<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Opera was written upon the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion; a circum&s;tance which may palliate, though not excu&s;e its faults. The &s;ubject of the fable remains as in the original; but a few alterations have been made in its con&s;truction; and the writer has attempted to heighten the characters by a colouring of humour.</P>
<P>FEW pieces have experienced a more extra|ordinary per&s;ecution. Previous to its ap|pearance, the Manager and Writer were pe&s;tered with anonymous letters, threaten|ing its de&s;truction, by the force of party, for their daring to attempt an emulous op|po&s;ition to the Romance under the &s;ame title then preparing at <HI>Drury Lane:</HI> and, after it appeared, &s;everal of the prints teemed with &s;evere animadver&s;ions and abu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6">ONE critic di&s;played his judgment with great ingenuity and candour: he opened his old &s;chool &s;atchell, and quoted both Greek and Latin, to point out pa&s;&s;ages analogous to cla&s;&s;ic ideas; every literal error of the pre&s;s was produced and animadverted on with a&s;toni&s;hing ability; he found pro&s;aic lines in the poetry, and poetic thoughts in the pro&s;e; but, above all, he made this great di&s;covery, that the &s;entiments of <HI>loyalty</HI> breathed through the dialogue, were inimi|cal to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>As men of &s;en&s;ibility <HI>feel</HI> when their ge|nero&s;ity is brought forward, this critic &s;hall not be put to the blu&s;h, but be permitted to indulge in the &s;ecret &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from his friendly exertions.</P>
