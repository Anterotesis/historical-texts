<P>Hear me, my Lord&mdash;That I have lov'd you, nay, that I &s;hall continue to do &s;o while life keeps her &s;eat, is the only excu&s;e I can offer for my frailty&mdash;I have hitherto obey'd my father's will, per|mit
<PB N="77" REF="90">me now to follow the dictates of my own&mdash;Had I my innocence, and was mi&s;tre&s;s of the untold trea|&s;ures of the ea&s;t&mdash;all that the &s;un &s;urveys in his di|urnal round, you &s;hou'd be ma&s;ter of it&mdash;but cover'd with infamy as I am, tho' you cou'd rai&s;e me to the utmo&s;t pinnacle where &s;tar-crown'd virtue ought to &s;it&mdash;a con&s;cious pride wou'd forbid the exaltation.</P>

<P>Is then my dream of bli&s;s de&s;troy'd?&mdash;my new-found ble&s;&s;ing, turn that way, and intercede with your inexorable mother&mdash;tell her my peace here and hereafter depends upon her receiving my peni|tential vows.</P>

<P>My Lord, the honey-dropping tongue of &s;eraphic eloquence cannot move me to change my purpo&s;e&mdash;I have now attain'd my utmo&s;t wi&s;hes, to &s;ee you thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of your failings, and wou'd fain retire to that peaceful cottage which this event has drawn me from, there, with my little ro&s;e|lipp'd comforter, pa&s;s my future hours in undi&s;turbed &s;olitude.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pre&s;s her no farther, brother&mdash;leave it to time&mdash;when &s;he is &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured of your &s;teady per&s;everance in the paths of rectitude, the love &s;he acknowledges for you may probably induce her at la&s;t to reward your con&s;tancy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Lady Fanny, with your leave, we'll retire and celebrate the &s;urprizing events of this happy day, events which mu&s;t fully manife&s;t to every boholder, that however virtue may for a time be oppre&s;t and held in durance, yet is it always the pe|culiar, and never-de&s;erted favourite, of rewarding Providence.</P>

<L>It matters not, good &s;olks, &s;ay what you will,</L>
<L>Approve, or di&s;approve our author's &s;kill,</L>
<L>'Tis &s;ure there mu&s;t be <HI>Macaronies</HI> &s;till.</L>
<L>For phantom-fa&s;hion leads us by the no&s;e,</L>
<L>And makes us die for every whim &s;he &s;hews.</L>
<L>A coat, a club, a feather, will engage</L>
<L>A genius of the <HI>Bon Ton</HI> for an age;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Newton's</HI> &s;y&s;tem, bear th' inventor's name,</L>
<L>And rank him higher in the li&s;ts of fame.</L>
<L>In <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> garb, we know, plain common-&s;en&s;e</L>
<L>To modi&s;h under&s;tanding gives offence;</L>
<L>And mode&s;t merit, if perchance one meets,</L>
<L>How awkward creeps the &s;tranger thro', the &s;treets!</L>
<L>Whil&s;t fan-tail'd folly, with <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> air,</L>
<L>Commands that homage &s;en&s;e alone &s;hou'd &s;hare,</L>
<L>The world's &s;o <HI>macaronied</HI> grown of late,</L>
<L>That common mortals now are out of date;</L>
<L>No &s;ingle cla&s;s of men this merit claim,</L>
<L>Or high, or low, in faith 'tis all the &s;ame;</L>
<L>For &s;ee the Doctor, who, with &s;apient, wig,</L>
<L>Gold cane, grave phiz, ere while look'd more than big,</L>
<L>With <HI>France</HI>'s foretop decorates his face,</L>
<L>Pre&s;cribes and dre&s;&s;es with <HI>macaronied</HI> grace;</L>
<L>Then &s;wears he hates all formal &s;tuff,</L>
<L>For gravity in practice is a puff.</L>
<L>The Soldier, once that hardy &s;on of arms,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;oul was rouz'd, was fir'd with war's alarms,</L>
<L>Forgets the eminence on which he &s;tood,</L>
<L>Whene'er his country call'd, how boil'd his blood!</L>
<L>Re&s;igns the glory his forefathers won,</L>
<L>And lives <HI>Britannia</HI>'s alienated &s;on.</L>

<L>Such gen'ral folly your attention claims,</L>
