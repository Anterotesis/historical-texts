<P>WE &s;hall begin with a De&s;cription of <HI>Peter</HI> the Savage, deferring our o|ther Curio&s;ities to &s;ome following Papers.</P>
<P><HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus,</HI> the two famous wild Men of Antiquity, and <HI>Or&s;in</HI> that of the Mo|derns, have been ju&s;tly the Admiration of all Mankind: Nor can we pre&s;age le&s;s of this

Wild Youth, as may be gathered from that famous and well-known Prophecy of <HI>Lilly</HI>'s, which being now accompli&s;h'd, is mo&s;t ea&s;ily interpreted.<Q><L>When <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hall wend to <HI>Bene|vento,</HI></L>

<L>Then &s;hall an Oak be brought to Bed,</L>
<L>Of Creature neither taught nor fed;</L>
<L>Great Feats &s;hall he atchieve&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The Pope is now going to <HI>Benevento;</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have broke their Treaty; the Em|peror Trades to <HI>China;</HI> and <HI>Lilly,</HI> were he alive, mu&s;t be convinced, that it was not the Empre&s;s <HI>Fau&s;tina</HI> that was was meant in the Prophecy.</P>

It is evident by &s;everal Tokens about this Wild Gentleman, that he had a Father and Mo|ther like one of us; but there being no Regi&s;ter of his Chri&s;tning, his Age is only to be gue&s;&s;ed at by his Stature and Countenance, and ap|peareth to be about Twelve or Thirteen. His being &s;o young was the Occa&s;ion of the great Di&s;appointment of the Ladies, who came to the Drawing Room in full Expectation of &s;ome Attempt upon their Cha&s;tity: So far is true, that he endeavour'd to Ki&s;s the young Lady <HI>W&mdash;le,</HI> who for that rea&s;on is become the Envy of the Circle; this being a Declaration of Nature, in favour of her &s;uperior Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;aith, That Man is the mo&s;t Mi|mick of all Animals; which Opinion of that great Philo&s;opher is &s;trongly confirm'd by the Behaviour of this Wild Gentleman, who is en|dow'd with that Quality to an extreme Degree. He receiv'd his fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions at Court: His Manners are, fir&s;t to lick People's Hands, and then turn his Breech upon them; to thru&s;t his Hand into every body's Pocket; to climb over Peoples Heads; and even to make u&s;e of the Royal Hand, to take what he has a mind to. At his fir&s;t Appearance he &s;eiz'd on the Lord Chamberlain's Staff, put on his Hat be|fore the King; from whence &s;ome have conje|ctur'd, that he is either de&s;cended from a Gran|dee
<PB N="6" REF="5">
of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Earls of <HI>King&s;ale</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> However, the&s;e are manife&s;t Tokens of his innate Ambition; he is extremly tena|cious of his own Property, and ready to in|vade that of other People. By this mimick Quality he di&s;covered what wild Bea&s;t had nur&s;ed him: Ob&s;erving Children to ask Ble&s;&s;ing of their Mothers, one Day he fell down upon his Knees to a Sow, and mutter'd &s;ome Sounds in that humble Po&s;ture.</P>
<P>It has been commonly thought, that he is <HI>U&mdash;</HI> natural Brother, becau&s;e of &s;ome re|&s;emblance of Manners, and the officious Care of <HI>U&mdash;</HI> about him; but the Superiority of the Parts and Genius in <HI>Peter,</HI> demon&s;trates this to be impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Though he is ignorant both of ancient and modern Languages, (that Care being left to the ingenious Phy&s;ician, who is entru&s;ted with his Education) yet he di&s;tingui&s;hes Objects by certain Sounds fram'd to him&s;elf, which Mr. <HI>Rotenberg,</HI> who brought him over, un|der&s;tands perfectly. Beholding one Day the Shambles with great Fear and A&s;toni&s;h|ment, ever &s;ince he calls Man by the &s;ame Sound which expre&s;&s;eth Wolf. A young Lady is a Peacock, old Women Mag|pyes and Owls; a Beau with a <HI>Toupee,</HI> a Monkey; Gla&s;s, Ice; Blue, Red, and Green
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Ribbons, he calls Rainbows; an Heap of Gold a Turd. The fir&s;t Ship he &s;aw, he took to be a great Bea&s;t &s;wimming on her Back, and her Feet tied above her: The Men that came out of the Hold he took to be her Cubs, and won|der'd they were &s;o unlike their Dam. He un|der&s;tands perfectly the Language of all Bea&s;ts and Birds, and is not, like them, confin'd to that of one Species. He can bring any Bea&s;t what he calls for, and no doubt is much mi&s;s'd now in his Native Woods, where he us'd to do good Offices among his Fellow Citizens, and &s;erv'd as a Mediator to reconcile their Diffe|rences. One Day he warn'd a Flock of Sheep that were driving to the Shambles, of their Danger, and upon uttering &s;ome Sounds, they all fled. He takes va&s;t Plea&s;ure in Conver&s;a|tion with Hor&s;es; and going to the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> to conver&s;e with Two of his intimate Acquain|tances in the King's Stable, as he pa&s;s'd by, he Neighed to the Hor&s;e at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s;</HI> be|ing as it were &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee him &s;o high, he &s;eem'd to take it ill that the Hor&s;e did not an|&s;wer him; but I think no body can undervalue his Under&s;tanding for not being skilled in Sta|tuary.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;eth his Joy mo&s;t commonly by Neighing; and whatever the Philo&s;ophers may talk of their Ri&s;ibility, Neighing is a more noble Expre&s;&s;ion of that Pa&s;&s;ion than Laughing,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
which &s;eems to me to have &s;omething Silly in it; and be&s;ides, is often attended with Tears. Other Animals are &s;en&s;ible they deba&s;e them|&s;elves, by mimicking Laughter; and I take it to be a general Ob&s;ervation, that the top Felicity of Mankind is to imitate Monkeys and Birds: Witne&s;s <HI>Harlequins, Scaramouches</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;querades;</HI> on the other Hand, Monkeys, when they would look extreamly &s;illy, endea|vour to bring them&s;elves down to Mankind. Love he expre&s;&s;eth by the Cooing of a Dove, and Anger by the Croaking of a Raven, and it is not doubted but that he will &s;erve in Time as an Interpreter between us and other Animals.</P>
<P>Great In&s;truction is to be had from this Wild Youth in the Knowledge of Simples; and I am of Opinion, that he ought al|ways to attend the Cen&s;ors of the Col|lege in their Vi&s;itation of Apothecaries Shops.</P>
<P>I am told that the new Sect of Herb|eaters intend to follow him into the Fields, or to beg him for a Clerk of their Kitchen: And that there are many of them now thinking of turning their Children into Woods to Graze with the Cattle, in hopes to rai&s;e a healthy and moral Race, refin'd from the Corruptions of this Luxurious World.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
He &s;ings naturally &s;everal pretty Tunes of his own Compo&s;ing, and with equal Faci|lity, in the <HI>Chromatick, Inharmonick,</HI> and <HI>Diatonick</HI> Stile, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be of infinite U&s;e to the Academy, in judging of the Merits of their Compo&s;ers, and is the only Per&s;on that ought to decide betwixt <HI>Cuzzoni</HI> and <HI>Fau&s;tina.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot omit his fir&s;t Notion of Cloaths, which he took to be the natural Skins of the Creatures that wore them, and &s;eem'd to be in great Pain for the pulling off a Stock|ing, thinking the poor Man was a Fleaing.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that there are di&s;affected People, who &s;ay he is a <HI>Pretender,</HI> and no genuine Wild Man. This Calumny proceeds from the fal&s;e Notions they have of Wild Men, which they frame from &s;uch as they &s;ee about the Town, who&s;e Actions are rather ab&s;urd than wild; therefore it will be incumbent on all young Gentlemen, who are ambitious to ex|cel in this Character, to Copy this true Origi|nal of Nature.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;es of this Wild Man are va&s;tly more acute than tho&s;e of a Tame one; he can follow the Track of a Man, or any other Bea&s;t of Prey. A Dog is an A&s;s to him for
<PB N="10" REF="9">
finding Trouf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">es; his Hearing is more perfect, becau&s;e his Ears not having been co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fin'd by Bandages, he can move them like a Drill, and turn them towards the Sonorous Object.</P>
<P>Let us pray the Creator of all Beings, Wild and Tame, that as this wild Youth, by being brought to Court, has been made a Chri&s;tian; &s;o &s;uch as are at Court, and are no Chri&s;tians, may lay a&s;ide their Savage and Rapacious Na|ture, and return to the Meekne&s;s of the Go&s;pel.</P>
