<L>'Re&s;ign'd I quit the lo&s;ing path I trod,</L>
<L>'Fall'n is my idol&mdash;and I wor&s;hip God?'</L>
<L>She ceas'd&mdash;the choir intones the fun'ral &s;ong,</L>
<L>Which holy echoes plaintively prolong:</L>
<L>And now the &s;olemn organ, tun'd to woe, <MILESTONE N="295"></L>
<L>Pour'd the clear notes pathetically &s;low:</L>
<L>The&s;e rites perform'd&mdash;along th' extending fane,</L>
<L>She now attends the &s;low-proceeding train;</L>
<L>Who o'er the mournful cypre&s;s-&s;haded way,</L>
<L>To the expecting tomb, the dead convey: <MILESTONE N="300"></L>
<L>See now the prie&s;ts, the clo&s;ing act prepare,</L>
<L>And to the dark&s;ome vault commit their care:</L>
<L>At this dread &s;cene, too feelingly di&s;tre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>She pour'd the la&s;t effu&s;ions of her brea&s;t</L>

<L>In all the tenderne&s;s of grief rejoin'd:</L>
<L>'Oh beauty's flow'r&mdash;oh plea&s;ure ever new&mdash;</L>
<L>'Oh friend&s;hip, love, and con&s;tancy adieu: <MILESTONE N="310"></L>

<L>'And &s;ympathy of heart&mdash;farewell, farewell!</L>
<L>'Not all of ARABERT this tomb contains, <MILESTONE N="315"></L>

<L>'Ha&s;te LEONORE&mdash;thy other &s;elf rejoin,</L>

<L>'Ah, tru&s;t me ARABERT! to &s;hare thy doom,</L>
