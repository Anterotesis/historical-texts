<HEAD>LETTER I. MISS HARLEY, TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures I propo&s;ed to my&s;elf, on my return to England, was to meet my dear Euphemia; to bind, if po&s;&s;ible, in fa&s;ter bands, that tender friend&s;hip which has united us from our earlie&s;t years; to live in &s;weet &s;ociety together: to &s;uffer only &s;hort ab&s;ences; rendered tolerable by frequent letters, and the dear hope of meeting &s;oon again. But how are the&s;e expectations de&s;troyed! You are going to leave me; and, too probably, for ever I
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Long tracts of land, and an immea&s;ur|able ocean, will &s;oon divide us. I &s;hall hear from you once or twice in a year, perhaps: my dear Euphemia will be lo&s;t to me; and all that now remains of that friend&s;hip, which was the pride and happine&s;s of my life, will be the &s;ad re|membrance of a good I once enjoyed, but which is fled for ever!</P>
<P>HOW &s;hall I teach my heart to forget you! How &s;hall I bear the conver&s;ation of other young women of our age and condition, after being u&s;ed to yours! It was &s;ome merit to be capable of ta&s;t|n g it with &s;o high a reli&s;h, as to render that of my other companions in&s;ipid. There are friend&s;hips that &s;erve only to pa&s;s away the time, and &s;often the te|diou&s;ne&s;s of &s;olitude; but yours, be|&s;ides being delightful, was profitable. I never read your letters, but I brought away plea&s;ures that remained, and ad|vantages that did you no hurt. I grew rich by what I took from you, without
<PB N="5" REF="5">
impoveri&s;hing you by my gain. In a word, I was happy, and I am &s;o no more. I mu&s;t lo&s;e you! there is no remedy! My tears efface my letters as I write! I cannot, I would not, re&s;train them! The wi&s;e may call the&s;e tender feelings in|firmities of the mind, if they will; I do not wi&s;h to be without them, and I had rather have my malady than their health.</P>
<P>BUT tell me, my Euphemia, by what &s;trange fatality have all the&s;e things happened? When I went to France, I left you rich and happy; the reputed heire&s;s of a large fortune, both your be|loved parents alive, and every pro&s;pect brightening before you. What a re|ver&s;e, in the &s;pace of a few months! An orphan! your inheritance lo&s;t! married; and, in con&s;equence of that marriage, becoming an exile from your country, doomed to wa&s;te your days in America! I cannot bear to think of it! But you go with a hu&s;band you love. I never
<PB N="6" REF="6">
thought my Euphemia very &s;u&s;ceptible of that pa&s;&s;ion. Mr. Neville undoubted|ly mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s an uncommon &s;hare of merit, to have &s;o &s;oon conquered your indifference, your re&s;erve, and, if I may now venture to &s;ay &s;o, your indi&s;po&s;ition to the married &s;tate. Oh! had it been otherwi&s;e, with what plea&s;ure &s;hould I have communicated to you the happy change in my fortune; a fortune which, by &s;haring with you, I &s;hould have doubly enjoyed! I cannot enter into par|ticulars now; my mind is too much agi|tated. Write to me &s;oon: yet what can you &s;ay to comfort me? If you cannot &s;ay that you are not to quit England, it will be the fir&s;t of your letters that I &s;hall not receive with tran&s;port. Adieu, my ever-dear Euphemia.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. MISS HARLEY, TO MRS. NEVILLE. IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot let the po&s;t go away without giving you the particulars of that happy change in my fortune which, while my heart was &s;o full of your lo&s;s that I could utter nothing but com|plaints, I only hinted at: but you would have rea&s;on to be offended with me if I was &s;ilent on this &s;ubject, knowing &s;o well as I do the tender intere&s;t you take in whatever concerns me.</P>
<P>YOU never could be per&s;uaded to think that my uncle's marriage with Mi&s;s Fenwick would make any altera|tion in his conduct towards me, having brought me up with a tenderne&s;s and care that &s;upplied the lo&s;s of my parents;
<PB N="8" REF="8">
a lo&s;s which I could only know by re|flection, being but an infant when they died, and which the kindne&s;s of my uncle made it impo&s;&s;ible for me to feel. But in this you was mi&s;taken, my dear friend: Lady Harley was a true &s;tep-mother, and contrived to alienate my uncle's af|fection from me by artifices which im|po&s;ed upon us both. I will give you two or three in&s;tances of her plan of ope|rations, as they have been &s;ince explain|ed to me.</P>
<P>MY uncle, who really loved me, and viewed all my actions in a favourable light, was particularly plea&s;ed with a certain attention which prevented his wi&s;hes, and made him perceive that I was delighted when I could be u&s;eful to him. There is nothing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as to know how to bear tedious moments. My uncle did not po&s;&s;e&s;s this art: he is, as you know, a man of &s;en&s;e, and &s;ome learning; but having pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his life in the common track of
<PB N="9" REF="9">
men of fortune and fa&s;hion, his amu&s;e|ments mu&s;t come all from without: he knew not how to &s;trike out any for him|&s;elf, from re&s;ources which a mind more cultivated might have afforded him.</P>
<P>SOME time after his marriage, the gout began to vi&s;it him with periodical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he bore the pain and the confinement with much impatience. Lady Harley, who&s;e fondne&s;s for him always appeared exce&s;&s;ive, rather tired than relieved him by her importunate care&s;&s;es: which, however, he received without any ap|parent peevi&s;hne&s;s; for, to be &s;ure, he knew how to value a love &s;o tender and pa&s;&s;ionate, with which he had in&s;pired a woman twenty years younger than him&s;elf!</P>
<P>MY company was now more accept|able than my aunt's. I &s;ung, I played to him: I gave the rein to my natural vivacity, and endeavoured to divert him by a thou&s;and lively &s;allies of imagina|tion.
<PB N="10" REF="10">
I read to him &s;ometimes; and per|ceived, with great &s;atisfaction, that he began to acquire a ta&s;te for this amu&s;e|ment. My voice and manner plea&s;ed him. He had a well-&s;tored library; and he approved my choice of the books which were to furni&s;h out his entertain|ment. You will ea&s;ily imagine how much this ta&s;te for reading increa&s;ed upon him, when I tell you that I read all Plutarch's Lives to him in le&s;s than a fortnight. Thus this long fit of the gout pa&s;&s;ed away; during which, my aunt had time to make ob&s;ervations on her own in&s;ufficiency on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and my apparent &s;uperiority over her. A &s;econd attack of the gout gave her an opportunity to practi&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e ar|tifices which &s;he had imagined, in order to le&s;&s;en my uncle's regard for me. She redoubled her cares and a&s;&s;iduity; &s;he &s;carce ever left him a moment; &s;he watched his looks, and every turn of his di&s;temper, with &s;uch an anxious &s;olici|tude, as if her life depended upon his.
<PB N="11" REF="11">
She would ri&s;e &s;everal times in the night, and run into his chamber to know if he &s;lept, and if the nur&s;e was attentive. A thou&s;and things of this kind &s;he did, which left me, fond as I was of my uncle, far behind her in the&s;e outward te&s;timonies of affection.</P>
<P>IT is common for people to judge of friend&s;hip by the &s;hew it makes, without con&s;idering that &s;uper&s;tition is fuller of ceremonies than true devotion. My at|tentions appeared cold and con&s;trained, compared with tho&s;e of my aunt; and were received with indifference. My uncle now &s;eldom de&s;ired me to read; and, when I offered to take a book, he would a&s;k me, if I did not think reading &s;o much had hurt me. I &s;ometimes &s;miled at this: and he would add, with a &s;ignificant look&mdash;<Q>Reading aloud is not good for one who has weak lungs.</Q> &mdash;'That is not my ca&s;e, Sir', replied I. 'I am glad of it', &s;aid he, coldly: <Q>but, however, you &s;hall not read to
<PB N="12" REF="12">
me.</Q> I was quite confounded at this peremptory refu&s;al, and knew not what to &s;ay to him; but, though vexed and mortified to the la&s;t degree, I &s;uffered no complaints to e&s;cape me, becau&s;e I was not willing to di&s;compo&s;e my uncle, or gratify the malice of Lady Harley, who, I judged, was at the bottom of this peevi&s;hne&s;s in him: and I judged right; for this was the manner in which &s;he effected her purpo&s;e, as my uncle after|wards informed me.</P>
<P>ONE day, when he de&s;ired her to bid me come and read to him, &s;he regretted her not having equal talents with me for that employment&mdash;'Which if I had', &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hould not be afraid of fall|ing into a con&s;umption by u&s;ing them'. &mdash;'Why, has Mari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that notion?' &s;aid Sir John. 'She certainly has', &s;aid my aunt: <Q>but you mu&s;t not mention to her what I tell you. She complains of a pain in her brea&s;t; of &s;hortne&s;s of breath; and declares, that when &s;he has
<PB N="13" REF="13">
read to you an hour or two, &s;he feels as if &s;he was ready to expire with a &s;trange oppre&s;&s;ion and faintne&s;s. She has carried her apprehen&s;ions &s;o far, as to &s;end her ca&s;e to an eminent phy&s;i|cian; who&s;e an&s;wer is, that if &s;he con|tinues to read aloud, &s;he will fall into a decline.</Q></P>
<P>MY uncle was amazed and confound|ed at hearing this, for I never looked better in my life; and he took notice of that circum&s;tance. Lady Harley a&s;&s;ured him I was perfectly well, and in very good &s;pirits; 'And therefore', added &s;he, <Q>it is the more &s;urprizing that &s;he &s;hould give way to &s;uch &s;trange fan|cies.</Q></P>
<P>MY aunt followed this fir&s;t blow with many others of the &s;ame kind, which would be tedious to enumerate: &s;o that at length my uncle viewing all my actions in an unfavourable light, &s;et me down in his mind as a perfect hypocrite; a cha|racter
<PB N="14" REF="14">
which he ever de&s;pi&s;ed and hated. But although, in con&s;equence of this opinion, he withdrew his affection from me; yet, as it produced no other altera|tion in his behaviour than a certain cold|ne&s;s and re&s;erve, which rather increa&s;ed than le&s;&s;ened that politene&s;s which was &s;o natural to him, I knew not on what ground to build a complaint. My ex|pences were as liberally &s;upplied as be|fore; my reque&s;ts as readily granted. My uncle, as he has &s;ince told me, could never be brought to hate his brother's daughter, though he cea&s;ed to love me as his own.</P>
<P>BEING in this unfavourable di&s;po&s;ition towards me, he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to pre&s;s me to a marriage, in which my in|clinations were much le&s;s con&s;ulted than my intere&s;t. You know the man I re|fu&s;ed, my dear Euphemia; and you did not chide me for my di&s;obedience. My, however, was offended; and as I was ab&s;olutely incapable of repairing my
<PB N="15" REF="15">
fault, or even repenting of it, his con|tinued di&s;plea&s;ure gave me &s;o deep a concern, that my &s;ituation became very mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>MRS. Irwin was about this time pre|paring to go to the &s;outh of France, for the recovery of her health: as &s;he was a near relation of my mother's, and a very worthy woman, I a&s;ked and obtain|ed leave to attend her. I left England without any regret, but parting with you, my &s;weet friend; for my uncle ap|peared &s;o happy in the pa&s;&s;ionate tender|ne&s;s of his young wife, and &s;o com|pleatly e&s;tranged from me, that I could not &s;uppo&s;e my ab&s;ence would give him any unea&s;ine&s;s. He provided for my ex|pences, however, with his u&s;ual gene|ro&s;ity. When I took leave of him, my tears, and the ardour with which I ki&s;&s;ed his hand, &s;eemed to awaken &s;ome tender emotions; for he turned a&s;ide, and wiped his eyes: but immediately afterwards, as if hardened by &s;ome unfavourable
<PB N="16" REF="16">
recollection, he relap&s;ed into his former coldne&s;s, and took a much more cere|monious than kind leave of me. My aunt acted her part extremely well; regretted the lo&s;s of my company, and comforted her&s;elf with the hope of a happy meet|ing in a few months. Mrs. Irwin was amazed at the a&s;cendant Lady Harley had gained over a man of my uncle's good &s;en&s;e: 'This woman', &s;aid &s;he, <Q>will, as the poet &s;ays&mdash;
<Q>Mould his pa&s;&s;ions till &s;he makes his will.</Q>
But it is my opinion, that your excur|&s;ion to the Continent will prove le&s;s favourable to her machinations than your &s;tay here. With friends and lovers, ab&s;ence is a kind of Death, which &s;heds oblivion over faults, and heightens every virtue and amiable quality. Lady Harley will now mi&s;s a thou&s;and opportunities of hurting you with your uncle, which artifice on her &s;ide, and innocent &s;ecurity on yours, would have furni&s;hed her with
<PB N="17" REF="17">
if you had &s;taid here.</Q> It is certain, that the fine fabrick &s;he had rai&s;ed with &s;uch an expence of fal&s;hood, was de|&s;troyed on a &s;udden by means which &s;he could neither fore&s;ee nor prevent.</P>
<P>WITH what plea&s;ure do I turn from this dark &s;ide of my fortune, to one in which my dear Euphemia will &s;hare in my &s;atisfaction! But what do I &s;ay! My Euphemia is going to leave me! This thought, like the &s;tings of a guilty con|&s;cience, &s;addens all my enjoyments; and, when I &s;hould be happy, gives me up to tears and complainings. But you wilt chide me if I continue this &s;train. Adieu, my dear friend.</P>
<P>IN my next, you &s;hall have a full ac|count of all that remains for you to know concerning my pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Mean time, pity ray impatience, my anxiety; and explain to me the cau&s;es of this &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune, and all that has happened to you in a &s;epara|tion
<PB N="18" REF="18">
of a few months; and which, alas! is &s;o &s;oon to be followed by one of many years. But I will fly this thought. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. MRS. NEVILLE, TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>WHY does my dear Maria imagine I would chide her for a &s;en&s;ibility &s;o amiable in her, &s;o flattering to me who am the object of it? Am I qualified to recommend apathy to you, who &s;hare &s;o deeply with you in an affliction that is common to us both; and while my heart is &s;till &s;marting with a wound which never, never can be healed? You knew my mother, Maria; you knew her excel|lence: judge what my grief mu&s;t be for her lo&s;s. But &s;he is happy! her patient-&s;uffering virtue has it's ju&s;t reward.</P>
<P>So little do events depend upon the mo&s;t prudent mea&s;ures, that had &s;he lived to &s;ee the unpro&s;perous event of a mar|riage which was her own work; and from which, in her la&s;t moments, &s;he owed all her con&s;olation with regard to me; &s;he
<PB N="20" REF="20">
would have been mi&s;erable. Heaven &s;pared her this affliction: and, did not &s;elf mingle too frequently in our mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;hould not now grieve &s;o much for her death, as rejoice in her exemption from an evil which &s;he might not perhaps have borne with her u&s;ual fortitude. But you &s;hall have my hi&s;tory from the time of our &s;epara|tion; and an eventful one it is, for the time. I have lei&s;ure enough; and to rehear&s;e the pa&s;t, when the pre&s;ent is un|happy, and the future pre&s;ents only a gloomy pro&s;pect, is not &s;o irk&s;ome a ta&s;k as to make me decline obeying you.</P>
<P>SCARCE were my tears dried up for your &s;udden and unexpected departure, when a &s;urprizing alteration in the tem|per and behaviour of my father filled my mother and my&s;elf with the mo&s;t unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions. He became peevi&s;h, melancholy, &s;ilent, and re&s;erv|ed: he &s;hunned company, &s;taid much
<PB N="21" REF="21">
at home, and pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his time &s;hut up in his clo&s;et; and was inacce&s;&s;ible even to my mother, who certainly was not even then wholly ignorant of the cau&s;e of this great change in him. A &s;troke of the pal&s;y followed the&s;e fir&s;t &s;ymptoms, and compleated our di&s;tre&s;s. It was but &s;light, however; and by the great &s;kill and care of his phy&s;i|cians he was re&s;tored to &s;ome degree of health, and able to take a journey to Bath, which they judged nece&s;&s;ary to his perfect recovery. I never doubted but I &s;hould be permitted to attend him thi|ther, as well as my mother; but my father had re&s;olved otherwi&s;e. I dur&s;t: not di&s;|pute his will: tender and affectionate as he always &s;eemed to me, he exacted, and never failed to receive, an implicit obedience to it. Spare me the de&s;crip|tion of this &s;ad parting! My father, as he turned from me, &s;hed tears, which he endeavoured to hide. I had thrown my|&s;elf into the arms of my governe&s;s; but, rai&s;ing my head to &s;natch a parting glance as he &s;tepped into the coach, at
<PB N="22" REF="22">
that moment he appeared to me more like a corp&s;e than my living father: I &s;hrieked, and fainted away. My dear mother, who had taken every precaution to make this ab&s;ence more &s;upportable to me, directed my governe&s;s to carry me immediately to Richmond, where I was impatiently expected by Mrs. High|more and her family, with whom I was to re&s;ide till my parents returned from Bath. You know this lady, my dear Maria; you know how greatly &s;he was e&s;teemed by my mother, who&s;e confi|dence &s;he had acquired by the appear|ance of an uncommon attachment to her. She had daughters of an age fit to be my companions; and their birth and accompli&s;hments made them very pro|per ones.</P>
<P>DURING our little journey, Mrs. Bur|ton employed every &s;oothing art to alle|viatemy grief: but that image, that death|like image of my father, filled my imagi|nation, and &s;wam continually before my
<PB N="23" REF="23">
&s;ight. I was for a long time in&s;en&s;ible to all the care&s;&s;es of Mrs. Highmore and the young ladies; which were, in|deed, carried to exce&s;s, particularly on the part of Mrs. Highmore and the eld|e&s;t daughter: but I was more touched with the behaviour of Lucy, the young|e&s;t of the&s;e ladies, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip for me had an air of candour and &s;weetne&s;s which won my confidence, and engaged my gratitude.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t letter I received from my mother, gave me &s;o favourable an ac|count of my father's health, that my me|lancholy apprehen&s;ions began to abate; and I was once more able to mix in &s;o|ciety, and to &s;hare in tho&s;e amu&s;ements which the family were eager to procure for me. This attention, apparently &s;o obliging, would certainly have made an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, if I had not been di&s;gu&s;ted with the adulation which Mrs. Highmore and her elde&s;t daughter were perpetually pouring in my ears. I have
<PB N="24" REF="24">
heard it &s;aid, that it is a mark of gran|deur to be hated by tho&s;e who do not know us, and flattered by tho&s;e who do: a young woman of fortune has this, in common with royalty, that &s;he &s;eldom hears truth. My governe&s;s would have it, that Mrs. Highmore had &s;ome de|&s;ign upon me; and her &s;u&s;picions were &s;trengthened by a vi&s;it made her by her &s;on, a youth of nineteen, from college, though it was not vacation-time.</P>
<P>THE young gentleman had probably received orders to be violently in love with me; for he &s;eemed to court oppor|tunities of &s;peaking to me alone, which I believe were often contrived for him: but he was too ba&s;hful to profit by them as was expected; for, after &s;ome general conver&s;ation about the weather, he u&s;ed to withdraw to a window, and whi&s;tle a tune. His behaviour might have af|forded me &s;ome diver&s;ion, had my mind been more at ca&s;e: but now every letter from Bath brought me &s;till le&s;s favour|able
<PB N="25" REF="25">
accounts of my father's health. At length, the fatal news of his death ar|rived; which, not with &s;tanding the cau|tion that was u&s;ed, the melancholy looks of my governe&s;s, and the re&s;t of the fa|mily, announced to me, before the ten|der Lucy, who&s;e &s;ad ta&s;k it was to pre|pare me for this &s;troke, could utter a word. 'My father is dead!' cried I, trembling: 'Is it not &s;o?' Lucy an|&s;wered me only by her tears. <Q>Then I have &s;een him', &s;aid I, 'for the la&s;t time; and the la&s;t time I &s;aw him, he looked as he is now.</Q></P>
<P>I CONTINUED &s;everal days in a mo&s;t melancholy &s;ituation; during which time the family took part in my afflic|tion with an appearance of the mo&s;t ten|der &s;ympathy: they &s;hut them&s;elves up with me, and neither paid nor received any vi&s;its; each &s;olicitous to outdo the other in endeavouring to calm my grief. On a &s;udden, this attention cea&s;ed; they &s;aw company as u&s;ual; and their en|gagements,
<PB N="26" REF="26">
both at home and abroad, took up their time &s;o much, that they had &s;carce a few moments to be&s;tow on me; and I have &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed a whole day without &s;eeing them in my apart|ment. The young man was &s;ent back to college, without leaving even a com|pliment for me. A &s;trange alteration now took place in their manner of con|ver&s;ing with me: re&s;pect and adulation were no more; their kindne&s;s was di&s;|gu&s;tingly familiar, their pity humiliat|ing, and their civility con&s;trained.</P>
<P>ALL this pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed for &s;ome time: but when the violence of my grief was in &s;ome degree abated, my at|tention was awakened fir&s;t to little neg|lects and failures in their u&s;ual polite|ne&s;s, that led to a fuller ob&s;ervation of their behaviour towards me; which I found &s;o changed, that they did not &s;eem to be the &s;ame per&s;on with whom I had conver&s;ed &s;o long. Perplexed and a&s;to|ni&s;hed at what I now for the fir&s;t time
<PB N="27" REF="27">
di&s;covered, I a&s;ked my governe&s;s the meaning of this &s;trange alteration. <Q>My dear,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>you now &s;ee the world as it is: and you will probably,</Q> added &s;he, &s;ighing, <Q>have but too many op|portunities of a&s;&s;enting to the truth of that maxim, which &s;eems to bear hard upon human nature; but which is ne|verthele&s;s but too true, That the gene|rality are bad.</Q>&mdash;'Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Lucy,' &s;aid I, without taking in the full meaning of her words, <Q>Lucy is &s;till the &s;ame; &s;he is not changed</Q>. At that moment the dear girl entered the room. I flew into her arms; and my heart being greatly oppre&s;&s;ed, I bur&s;t into tears. She look|ed at Mrs. Ben&s;on &s;ignificantly, as I af|terwards recollected; and then applied her&s;elf, with her u&s;ual tender &s;olicitude, to con&s;ole me. My governe&s;s retired upon Mrs. Highmore's coming in: Why, my good girl,' &s;aid &s;he to me, <Q>will you never have done grieving?</Q> Struck with the unu&s;ual coar&s;ene&s;s of her phra&s;e, I &s;tared at her without mak|ing
<PB N="28" REF="28">
any an&s;wer. 'Come,' pur&s;ued &s;he, <Q>you mu&s;t not &s;tay moping in the hou&s;e: take an airing in your chariot; you may not always have one.</Q> Here Lucy, in great agitation, &s;topped her; crying eagerly&mdash;'Mamma!' Mrs. Highmore, as if recollecting her&s;elf, replied&mdash;<Q>You are right. &mdash;But, Mi&s;s Lumley,</Q> &s;aid &s;he to me, <Q>have you had a letter from your mamma? How is &s;he? does &s;he talk of returning?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Would to Heaven I were with her!</Q> &s;aid I, pa&s;&s;ionately. 'Ah, poor woman!' &s;aid Mrs High|more, <Q>&s;he is in trouble enough; &s;he is greatly to be pitied.</Q> My tears now flowed afre&s;h: 'Pray, Madam,' &s;aid Lucy, receiving my declining head on her bo&s;om, <Q>leave me to comfort Mi&s;s Lumley: &s;he will be more calm when we are alone.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Well, I am going,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Highmore. <Q>Pray, my good girl, moderate your afflic|tion. &mdash;And, Lucy, do you hear? I can|not po&s;&s;ibly di&s;pen&s;e with your din|ing at table to-day: I have company,
<PB N="29" REF="29">
you know. You will hardly have time to dre&s;s.</Q> She went out of the room at the&s;e words; and I, with &s;ome peevi&s;hne&s;s, pre&s;&s;ed Mi&s;s Lucy to go and dre&s;s: but &s;he declared &s;he would not quit me that day, Mrs. Ben&s;on being obliged to go to town to tran&s;act &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s my mother had charged her with.</P>
<P>I HAVE related this little &s;cene cir|cum&s;tantially to you, my dear Maria, that you may have &s;ome notion of the a&s;toni&s;hment I mu&s;t be in at the altera|tion of this woman's &s;tile and behaviour, who a few weeks before had carried her re&s;pects and attentions to me even to &s;ervility. But the my&s;tery was &s;oon to be unravelled.</P>
<P>Two days after this, Mrs. Ben&s;on told, me I &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee my mother, 'When?' cried I impatiently.<Q>To|morrow, perhaps,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling; 'and perhaps, to-night.' I ro&s;e from
<PB N="30" REF="30">
my chair in a tran&s;port. <Q>Ah! &s;he is here,</Q> &s;aid I; 'let me fly to her!'&mdash; 'No, my dear,' &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, <Q>&s;he is not here; &s;he would not come here: but &s;he is in London. I have a note from her, ordering me to bring you to her. The chariot is getting ready, and we will &s;et out in a few minutes.</Q> Lucy came running to me all in tears: I took an affectionate leave of her; and re|ceived the parting civilities of Mrs. Highmore and her elde&s;t daughter with great coolne&s;s Mrs. Highmore charg|ed me to a&s;&s;ure her good friend, &s;o &s;he &s;tiled my mother, that it &s;hould not be long before &s;he called upon her. As &s;upercilious as this &s;peech was, the air that accompanied it was &s;till more &s;o I an&s;wered only by a &s;light bow; and we drove away.</P>
<P>My thoughts, wholly employed on the expected meeting with my dear mother, a meeting at once &s;o wi&s;hed and dread|ed, prevented my taking notice of the
<PB N="31" REF="31">
extreme dejection of Mrs. Ben&s;on, who &s;carce &s;poke to me all the way. Nor was I rouzed from my reverie, till I found my&s;elf in St. James's Square; when the carriage, in&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing into Pall Mall, where our hou&s;e was, drove directly to Charles Street, and &s;top|ped at a &s;mall hou&s;e, upon the window of which I ob&s;erved a bill for lodgings. 'Have you any bu&s;ine&s;s here?' &s;aid I to my governe&s;s. 'My dear,' replied &s;he, &s;ighing, <Q>we &s;hall find your mam|ma here.</Q>&mdash;'My mamma here!' cried I eagerly; and, &s;pringing out of the cha|riot, I flew up &s;tairs, upon the top of which I &s;aw her coming to meet me.</P>
<P>HER deep mourning, her pale and ema|ciated countenance, the tran&s;ient gleam of joy which the fir&s;t &s;ight of me occa|&s;ioned, effaced by a flood of tears, af|fected me with &s;uch poignant angui&s;h, that I &s;unk down at her feet; and, cla&s;p|ing her knees, remained there &s;peech|le&s;s and drowned in tears. Mrs. Ben&s;on
<PB N="32" REF="32">
rai&s;ed me, and led us both into the room. My dear mother continued gaz|ing on me for &s;ome time in &s;ilent &s;or|row; while I wept, and ki&s;&s;ed the hand with which &s;he affectionately pre&s;&s;ed mine. 'My dear child,' &s;aid &s;he, re|covering her&s;elf, <Q>you have, no doubt, paid your ju&s;t tribute of tears to the me|mory of your father. The time calls upon us for fortitude. You have, alas! many evils to &s;truggle again&s;t. Poverty is a more dreadful mon&s;ter than any Hercules overcame: and, to bear it with patience, to pre&s;erve our integrity, our independence of mind; in a word, to fall with dignity; is to be a greater hero than he was.</Q></P>
<P>AT the word Poverty I &s;tarted, and gazed on my mother eagerly. <Q>Yes, my dear,</Q> pur&s;ued &s;he, <Q>we are no longer rich; you are no longer an heire&s;s to a great fortune. From the &s;mall provi&s;ion your father made for me on our marriage, before he &s;ucceeded to
<PB N="33" REF="33">
his uncle's great riches, and which will cea&s;e at my death, we mu&s;t for the fu|ture draw our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Mr. Lum|ley died in&s;olvent. Hou&s;es, plate, jewels, furniture, all are &s;eized by the creditors! This &s;mall apartment in which you now &s;ee me, is my habitation; and even this I mu&s;t &s;oon exchange for one le&s;s expen&s;ive, and more &s;uitable to my circum&s;tances: for it mu&s;t be my part now to live in &s;uch a manner that my dear child may not be wholly de&s;ti|tute at my death. Something, I hope, I &s;hall be able, by the &s;tricte&s;t par&s;imony, to leave behind me, to put off the bad day of beggary!</Q> My mother could not re&s;train her tears at this word. She ro&s;e up, and &s;aid &s;he would retire to her bed-chamber for a few moments, and endeavour to compo&s;e her&s;elf.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he was gone, I gave free vent to tho&s;e emotions which re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s for her had hitherto re&s;train|ed. Mrs. Ben&s;on endeavoured to com|fort
<PB N="34" REF="34">
me. 'Tell me,' &s;aid I, <Q>if you know; tell me by what means this ruin was brought about?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Your fa|ther,</Q> replied &s;he, <Q>would have been a happy man, if he had continued in that ea&s;y mediocrity which once bound|ed his wi&s;hes: but no &s;ooner was he be|come po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the great riches your uncle had acquired in the Indies, than he plunged deep into all the fa&s;hion|able exce&s;&s;es of the age.</Q> The word All &s;he pronounced with a deep em|pha&s;is, and a meaning look that went to my heart. 'His &s;eat in parliament,' continued &s;he, <Q>co&s;t him an immen&s;e &s;um. He played high, and always with ill &s;ucce&s;s. In a word, he was ruined, my dear, before the continued di&s;&s;ipation in which he lived gave him lei&s;ure to look into his affairs. Re|flection, which came too late to pre|vent the wreck of his fortune, now produced a remor&s;e that preyed upon his mind, and brought on tho&s;e di&s;|orders which put a period to his life.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35">MY mother's entrance obliged me to re&s;train tho&s;e emotions which Mrs. Ben|&s;on's di&s;cour&s;e had excited: I dried my tears; I endeavoured to con&s;ole my mother by every &s;oothing power I po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. Her piety and good &s;en&s;e had already brought her to a &s;tate of perfect re&s;ignation in every thing that re&s;pected her&s;elf; it was for me only that &s;he felt: and it was to relieve her from that ten|der anxiety which preyed upon her &s;pi|rits, and de&s;troyed her health, that I made a &s;acrifice which I cannot repent of; though, alas! it proved fruitle&s;s. But here let me break off for the pre|&s;ent: I will continue my narrative &s;ome other time.

<HEAD>LETTER IV. MISS HARLEY, TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have almo&s;t effaced every word of your tender and affecting narrative with my tears. Alas! my &s;weet friend, what have you not &s;uffered! Why was I not with you during the&s;e hard trials? Why did you conceal your &s;ituation from me? I never received but two letters from you while I was in France. In the la&s;t there were &s;ome ob&s;cure hints, which greatly perplexed me, and which you have now but too well explained: My uncle expre&s;&s;es great tenderne&s;s and concern for you; and &s;peaks of your mother in terms of the highe&s;t admira|tion. He &s;ays, he was intimate enough with Mr. Lumley, to u&s;e the liberty of remon&s;trating again&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e errors in his conduct which have been
<PB N="38" REF="38">
the &s;ource of his misfortunes: 'But,' added he very &s;ententiou&s;ly, <Q>there is a wide di&s;tance between being &s;imply per&s;uaded that a thing is wrong, to the being &s;ufficiently &s;o as to make us fall to action, when we mu&s;t act con|trary to our inclinations. Mr. Lum|ley acknowledged there was rea&s;on in what I &s;aid; but did not alter his con|duct.</Q> &mdash;'How much ea&s;ier,' thought I, <Q>it is to be wi&s;er for others than our&s;elves!</Q> Had your father repre&s;ented to Sir John the imprudence of marry|ing, at his years, a gay young girl, he might have made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation: but this truth he was &s;oon convinced of by his own experience.</P>
<P>I HAD been near a year in France, when I received a letter from my uncle, very different from any of his former ones; for it was extremely affectionate. He expre&s;&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s at my long ab&s;ence, and much impatience for my return. This letter was accompanied
<PB N="39" REF="39">
with a large order upon his banker at Pa|ris, whither we were now going, and per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;tay there a month: after which, he &s;aid, he would expect me; and, if his health permitted, Lady Harley and he would meet me at&mdash;. He &s;aid not a word of tho&s;e cau&s;es of un|ea&s;ine&s;s which he had given me, (for when do men own they are in the wrong?) but concluded with profe&s;&s;ions of the tendere&s;t attachment to me. You will ea&s;ily con|ceive that, after the receipt of this letter, I pa&s;&s;ed my time very plea&s;antly at Paris; when, a few days before our intended de|parture, I received another letter from my uncle: it contained but a few lines; and tho&s;e &s;urprized me with an account of the death of Lady Harley. As I have not naturally a hard heart, nor an un|forgiving temper, the death of this lady gave me a real concern, particularly on my uncle's account, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, would be greatly afflicted. Mrs. Irwin agreed, that this news ought to ha&s;ten our
<PB N="40" REF="40">
journey, and accordingly we &s;et out im|mediately upon our return.</P>
<P>MY uncle was &s;urprized when he heard of my arrival &s;o much &s;ooner than he ex|pected; and, I could perceive, was plea&s;ed at my readine&s;s to oblige him. He re|ceived me very kindly; and, as I did not ob&s;erve any &s;igns of immoderate grief in his countenance, my compliments of condolence were but &s;hort. He men|tioned my aunt only once, and employed but a few words on the &s;ubject. <Q>Her ill|ne&s;s,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>was &s;udden, and reached it's height before &s;he was thought to be in any danger. The faculty com|plained of her ob&s;tinacy in refu&s;ing to be bled, and attributed her death to the want of that remedy.</Q> When my uncle took leave of me for the night, he &s;aid&mdash; <Q>I will &s;end Martin to you as &s;oon as I am in bed; he will inform you of &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances that have happened during your ab&s;ence.</Q> I believe you have &s;een
<PB N="41" REF="41">
this man: an old confidential &s;ervant, who had lived with him many years; and who, by his zeal and attachment, merited the great regard he expre&s;&s;ed for him.</P>
<P>MY curio&s;ity was &s;trongly excited, as well by my uncle's behaviour as by the&s;e words, which &s;eemed to indicate that &s;omething extraordinary had really hap|pened. As &s;oon as the good old man appeared, he congratulated me on my re|turn with tears; and a&s;&s;ured me the te|nants and &s;ervants had con&s;tantly prayed for it. 'And they did not &s;cruple,' pur|&s;ued he, <Q>to tell my lady her&s;elf how much they all longed to &s;ee you: and this &s;eemed to di&s;plea&s;e her, for my lady was cunning by halves only; and although &s;he per&s;uaded my ma&s;ter that &s;he was grieved for your ab&s;ence, &s;he did not take the &s;ame pains to deceive us.</Q></P>
<P>'SHE has certainly,' &s;aid I, <Q>been le&s;s guarded on &s;ome occa&s;ion or other
<PB N="42" REF="42">
than u&s;ual, for my uncle is greatly al|tered with re&s;pect to her; he appears not to regret her death, and &s;peaks of her with little affection.</Q></P>
<P>'AH, Madam!' &s;aid Mr. Martin, <Q>there is good rea&s;on for that. I have a curious hi&s;tory to relate to you, if you can have the patience to hear it: my ma&s;ter ordered me to tell you every circum&s;tance.</Q>&mdash;'Pray &s;it down,' &s;aid I, 'and let me have it all.' He did &s;o: and here is what he told me, and in his own words.</P>
<P>'You may remember, Madam,' &s;aid he, <Q>how childi&s;hly fond my lady af|fected to be of her hu&s;band; it was much wor&s;e after you was gone. She was continually taking his hand, &s;trok|ing his cheek, and would often ki&s;s him before the &s;ervants. I was &s;orry to &s;ee my good ma&s;ter &s;o played upon; and, if I dur&s;t, I would have told him that all was not gold that gli&s;ters.
<PB N="43" REF="43">
Mr. Greville, who, you know, Ma|dam, is a very facetious old gentle|man, and has a power of wit, u&s;ed to joke with my ma&s;ter about his young wife's prodigious fondne&s;s for him; and would often &s;ay very <HI>home</HI> things, which my ma&s;ter would &s;ometimes take very well, and &s;ometimes an&s;wer pee|vi&s;hly to; but they had been great friends from their youth, &s;o that it was not a little matter would part them. Now it happened that my ma&s;ter was taken with another fit of the gout, and griev|ous bad he was, &s;o that the doctors were afraid that it was getting up into his &s;tomach; and then, you know, Ma|dam, all would have been over with him. My lady &s;at by his bed-&s;ide al|mo&s;t continually, &s;ighing mo&s;t piteou&s;|ly, and &s;hedding rivers of tears while &s;he was with him: but her maid u&s;ed to &s;ay that, when &s;he was in her own apartment, &s;he had no need of an handkerchief to dry her eyes. Well, Madam, my poor ma&s;ter grew wor&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="44">
and wor&s;e; and my lady, to be &s;ure, more and more &s;orrowful. And now my ma&s;ter re&s;olved to alter his will: you may gue&s;s, Madam, who put that into his head. I was ordered to ride to town, and fetch Lawyer Gra&s;p, and &s;ome more gentlemen of that <HI>per|&s;ua&s;ion.</HI> I perceived what was go|ing forward: and, to be &s;ure, Ma|dam, I thought a new will, under my lady's direction, would not be favour|able to you, and that it was fit &s;ome friend of yours &s;hould be pre&s;ent; and no one was more proper than Mr. Gre|ville, who loves you &s;o dearly, and was, be&s;ides, my ma&s;ter's mo&s;t dear friend. So I ventured to &s;ay to my ma&s;ter&mdash;<Q>Does not your honour plea&s;e that I &s;hould &s;end or go for Mr. Greville upon this occa&s;ion?</Q> My lady look|ed as if &s;he could have eat me; and my ma&s;ter &s;aid weakly&mdash;<Q>Mr. Gre|ville is at his feat in&mdash; &mdash;, that is more than &s;eventy miles di&s;tant: it will be too much trouble for him to

come on &s;uch &s;hort notice.</Q>&mdash; "Sir," &s;aid I, <Q>I am &s;ure he will not think &s;o.</Q> My ma&s;ter &s;eemed to pau&s;e upon it; when my lady, lo&s;ing her tem|per quite, called me an officious fool; and, bur&s;ting into tears, &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Do you want to per&s;uade your ma&s;ter that he is dying.&mdash;My dear Sir John, the phy&s;icians a&s;&s;ure me you are better. Mr. Greville will be here in a week or two. Do not let this blockhead put &s;uch &s;ad thoughts into your head!</Q> She &s;obbed violently while &s;he was &s;peaking, holding my ma&s;ter's hand to her lips all the time. My ma&s;ter then &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Let him go for the law|yers, however.</Q> Upon which my lady, looking very &s;pitefully at me, &s;aid&mdash;"Do as you are ordered!" and I left the room immediately, with my heart full, as well for my dear ma&s;ter's danger, as for the inju&s;tice you were likely to &s;uffer, my dear young lady.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="46">I INTERRUPTED the hone&s;t man here; to thank him for the affection he had &s;hewn for me at a time when &s;elfi&s;h po|licy would have pointed out a different conduct; and, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I thank|ed him with an effu&s;ion of heart equal to his own. But I mu&s;t break off here; I am &s;ummoned to dinner. My uncle has been riding this morning, which has given me lei&s;ure to &s;cribble &s;o much: he has brought Mr. Greville home to din|ner.

<P>THE po&s;t not being yet gone out, I have time to add a few lines. Some|thing that fell from Mr. Greville, relating to you, has alarmed me greatly. I fear, I fear, my &s;weet friend, you are not likely to be as happy in the married &s;tate as you de&s;erve to be. Your hu&s;band, forgive
<PB N="47" REF="47">
my freedom, is thought to be ill-temper|ed; you are all &s;weetne&s;s, patience, and conde&s;cen&s;ion: I fore&s;ee from this con|tra&s;t, continual encroachments on one &s;ide; continual recedings on the other. You are one of tho&s;e few per&s;ons who ne|ver conte&s;t what they think they cannot obtain. What a dangerous power will &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition throw into the hands of one who is di&s;po&s;ed to u&s;e it tyranni|cally! Mr. Greville knows your hu&s;|band; and this is what he &s;aid upon my telling my uncle, in an&s;wer to his enquiry how I had been amu&s;ing my&s;elf all the morning, that I had been writing to you. 'Poor Mi&s;s Lumley!' &s;aid he; <Q>&s;he is married to Mr. Neville, then! There is nothing</Q>&mdash;a friend of mine &s;aid of him&s;elf, and may be applied to her&mdash;<Q>that could per&s;uade a believer in modern miracles to confe&s;s that any thing is impo&s;&s;ible to be done, but her ill fortune, which is unchange|able.</Q>&mdash;'I hope not,' &s;aid my uncle. 'There is no more room for hope,' replied
<PB N="48" REF="48">
Mr. Greville: <Q>&s;he is married to the wor&s;t-tempered man in the world; and that has crowned all her misfortunes.</Q></P>
<P>You may judge, my dear Euphemia, how I was affected by this di&s;cour&s;e: I a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions about Mr. Neville; and every an&s;wer I received &s;erved to convince me that his temper will make you very mi&s;erable. Good Heaven! and is it with this man that you are to cro&s;s the Atlantic! This the pro|tector, the friend, the companion, with whom you are to traver&s;e an immen&s;e ocean, and live in unknown regions, far from your country and all you love! Surely you can never con&s;ent to it; he cannot be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to de&s;ire it. If his duty calls him hence, his ten|derne&s;s for you ought to make him di&s;|pen&s;e with your accompanying him. You mu&s;t &s;tay with me, my dear Euphemia; my fortune is yours: my uncle will be a father to us both; he offers you his hou&s;e

With this an&s;wer I returned. My lady &s;eemed not at all &s;atisfied with the ha&s;te I had made, and her woman told me &s;he &s;hewed great impatience, and was very re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y all the time I was gone.</Q></P>
<Q><P>WELL, Madam, the lawyers came at la&s;t; they were &s;hut up with my ma&s;ter &s;everal hours, and my lady went back|wards and forwards continually. At la&s;t the chaplain and I were called up to wit|ne&s;s this fine will: the chaplain &s;et his name, but, as Fortune would have it, I had cut my right thumb &s;o de&s;perately about an hour before, that I could not hold my pen, &s;o I was excu&s;ed, and Coun|&s;ellor Worden's clerk &s;igned in&s;tead of me; and right glad was I that I had e&s;caped this odious office.</P>
<P>MY lady looked marvellou&s;ly plea&s;ed when this affair was over; that is, when &s;he was not in my ma&s;ter's chamber, for there her countenance was like Decem|ber,
<PB N="52" REF="52">
all cold and &s;urly, but all &s;un&s;hine every where el&s;e.</P>
<P>As I waited on the lawyers to their carriage, I heard Coun&s;ellor Worden &s;ay to the attorney, <Q>Sir John's next heir will not thank him for burthening his e&s;tate with &s;uch an enormous jointure for &s;o young a life as Lady Harley's. And Mi&s;s Harley</Q>, &s;aid the attorney, <Q>has no rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the &s;mall provi&s;ion that is made for her.</Q> They &s;hook their wi&s;e heads at each other, and &s;miled, as much as to &s;ay, <Q>Somebody has played her cards well.</Q> &mdash;Heaven forgive me, but I could not help hating them a little for the part they had in making this will: though to be &s;ure they were no ways to blame, you know, Madam.</P></Q>
<P>"No, certainly," &s;aid I, <Q>but I long to hear of my uncle's recovery; methinks you leave him too long on this &s;ick bed, Mr. Martin.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="53">'WHY, Madam,' replied the hone&s;t man, <Q>he grew better and better every day after this, and was &s;oon able to leave his bed, and when Mr. Gre|ville came he found him walking about his chamber. I had ju&s;t time to tell Mr. Greville all I knew of the matter, and he was &s;orely grieved at it, and lamented his not getting my letter &s;ooner. My lady complained much of what &s;he had &s;uffered during my ma&s;ter's illne&s;s. <Q>And yet you never looked better in your life, Madam,</Q> &s;aid he, dryly; <Q>if grief is &s;uch a friend to your complexion, what will joy be? Why, your lady&s;hip looks like May; but I am &s;orry,</Q> &s;aid he, turning to my ma&s;ter, <Q>to &s;ee my good friend here look &s;o much like January.</Q></Q></P>
<Q>THERE was &s;ome joke in this, I found; for Mr. Greville looked archly at my ma&s;ter, who blu&s;hed; and my lady &s;eemed half plea&s;ed and half angry. My lady's woman went tittering out of the
<PB N="54" REF="54">
room, and I followed, curious to know what &s;he laughed at. "Oh, Mr. Martin," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>if you had read as many books as I have, you would know what that comical gentleman <HI>luded</HI> to. Why, there is a tale in rhyme about January, an old knight, who mar|ried a young lady called May, and &s;he made a fool of him; and Mr. Greville as good as called my ma&s;ter and lady Ja|nuary and May&mdash;there was the je&s;t, Mr. Martin.</Q></Q>
<P>I WAS afraid the old man might have &s;ported with this idea too far, &s;o I thought fit to look very grave; upon which he recollected him&s;elf, and went on.</P>
<Q><P>MR. Greville &s;taid &s;everal days at the Hall, and during that time I believe he talked in a pretty home manner to my ma&s;ter; for I ob&s;erved, that, whenever they had had &s;ome private conver&s;a|tion, my ma&s;ter would be in a mu&s;ing mood a long time afterwards. My
<PB N="55" REF="55">
lady on the&s;e occa&s;ions always redou|bled her fondne&s;s; and Mr. Greville u&s;ed to cut his jokes without mercy; At length he went away; and now my lady, having my ma&s;ter all to her&s;elf, played all her old tricks over, but not with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s as formerly; for my ma&s;ter, though he recovered his health, did not appear half &s;o well plea&s;ed as u&s;ual; and u&s;ed to be often talking of you, Madam, and wi&s;hing for your return: and at la&s;t he &s;aid he would write to you, and in&s;i&s;t upon your coming home immediately. My lady was confounded, and brought a great many bad rea&s;ons, as my ma&s;|ter told her, to put him off this de|&s;ign: and finding &s;he could not prevail that way, &s;he fairly told him, that your temper was &s;o bad, it was impo&s;|&s;ible to live with you; and hereupon &s;he cried bitterly.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter was not moved, as &s;he expected, but &s;eemed a little angry,
<PB N="56" REF="56">
and defended you, Madam, very cor|dially, and in conclu&s;ion wrote to you, and gave me the letter before her face to get it properly conveyed to you, and glad was I of the office, you may be &s;ure. After this his Honour was continually &s;peaking of you, and al|ways in your prai&s;e; &s;o that my lady was &s;ufficiently mortified.</P></Q>
<P>I HAVE often ob&s;erved, my dear Eu|phemia, let a calumniator be ever &s;o artful, all that which does not directly hurt the per&s;ons abu&s;ed, turns to their advantage. This charge of bad tem|pers appeared to my uncle &s;o ill-found|ed, that it led him to weigh thoroughly many other faults &s;he had accu&s;ed me of, and to compare my behaviour with the picture &s;he u&s;ed to draw of my di&s;|po&s;ition; and the re&s;ult of this can|did inve&s;tigation was &s;o favourable for me, that upon my return I had rea&s;on to believe I &s;tood higher in his opinion
<PB N="57" REF="57">
than ever, as the &s;equel of my little Hi&s;|tory will &s;hew you.</P>
<P>BUT here I will conclude for the pre|&s;ent; a Letter from you is this moment brought me; does it or does it not bring an an&s;wer favourable to my wi&s;hes? &mdash;I break the &s;eal with eagerne&s;s. &mdash;Ah, my dear Euphemia, your fir&s;t words de&s;troy all my hopes. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DESTINED to live under the control of another, I find obedience to be a very nece&s;&s;ary virtue, and in my ca&s;e it is an indi&s;pen&s;able duty. I am a wife; I know to what that &s;acred tie obliges me: I am determined, by Heaven's a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, to fulfil the duties of my &s;ta|tion. My lot is ca&s;t perhaps for mi&s;ery here; the future will be like the pa&s;t: &s;o my foreboding heart &s;ugge&s;ts. I have drawn a blank in the great lottery of life, but there is a &s;tate beyond this, in which my hopes a&s;pire to a prize: to that all my wi&s;hes, all my endeavours tend. Philo&s;ophy may teach us to bear the pa&s;t and future evils; but it is the Chri&s;tian only that can endure the pre|&s;ent with fortitude. Oh, my dear Maria,
<PB N="59" REF="59">
what could have &s;upported me under my affliction for the death of my mother, but that active faith which made re&s;ign|ation to the will of Heaven at once my duty and my reward? &mdash;I perceive all the hard&s;hips of my &s;ituation, but I can|not avoid them without a crime; it is my duty to follow my hu&s;band; and what in other circum&s;tances I &s;hould certainly have done from inclination, I do now from better motives&mdash;from a &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e &s;acred obligations which the &s;tate I have entered into lays upon me; and which, whatever mortifica|tions I may meet with in the di&s;charge of them, are &s;till indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>BUT how &s;hall I thank you, my dear friend, for your kind and generous of|fers? how &s;hall I make you &s;en&s;ible of the gratitude that fills, that more than fills, that oppre&s;&s;es my heart, for this proof of your friendship? Words here are weak, and deeds, alas! are not in my power, for I am poor in every thing
<PB N="60" REF="60">
but in will. Do not, however, imagine my leaving this country &s;uch a misfortune; except you, I have nothing to regret, for the unfortunate have few friends; here every object reminds me of my former &s;tate, and makes the pre&s;ent more &s;en|&s;ibly felt. Every place where I have &s;een my mother, renews my grief for her lo&s;s. Change of &s;cene, new objects, and different cares, may perhaps weaken this &s;ad idea, and re&s;tore me &s;ome degree of tranquillity. Let this con&s;i|deration reconcile you to my departure; and though &s;eparated, we will not be wholly ab&s;ent&mdash;our minds &s;hall meet in conver&s;e&mdash;a con&s;tant intercour&s;e of let|ters &s;hall bring us within view of each other&mdash;&s;hall communicate our joys and &s;orrows, our hopes and fears, and all the little, as well as con&s;iderable, events of our lives.</P>

Tell me, Maria, how you like this &s;cheme, and whether you can re&s;olve to be as punctual in the performance of your part of it, as I propo&s;e to be of mine: meantime I will continue to give you a relation of &s;uch of my affairs as you are yet ignorant of, but not in this letter, which I di&s;patch immediately, to bear my warme&s;t acknowledgments for your mo&s;t generous offers, to ac|quaint you with my rea&s;ons for declining them, and to &s;hare with you that com|fort I derive from the plan I commu|nicate.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING can be offered in oppo&s;i|tion to the arguments you u&s;e in &s;upport of your re&s;olution to leave Eng|land with your hu&s;band. My heart murmurs, it is true; but my rea&s;on ap|proves &mdash;Approves, did I &s;ay?&mdash;I admire, I love, I almo&s;t adore you, my excellent friend! &mdash;Blame not the warmth of my expre&s;&s;ions. Mu&s;t we not revere virtue, unle&s;s it be con&s;ecrated by antiquity? What were the merits of an Arria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or a Portia, to your's? &mdash;Love produced in them tho&s;e great actions, for which they are &s;o famous. Religion and duty are the nobler motives which influence your's. To die for the man one loves is not an act of &s;uch heroi&s;m, as to chu&s;e mi&s;ery with the man one has no rea&s;on
<PB N="64" REF="64">
to love, becau&s;e we con&s;ider it to be our duty to do &s;o.</P>
<P>IT is the fate of the be&s;t things to be either wholly neglected, or at mo&s;t but little known. Such is this noble con|duct of your's; for few will know it, and fewer &s;till admire it. I, who am the greate&s;t lo&s;er by it, am yet capable of admiring it, and this is a merit you mu&s;t permit me to be vain of, &s;ince it co&s;ts me &s;o dear.</P>
<P>BUT it is time to introduce Mr. Mar|tin again. You tell me your griefs are &s;u&s;pended while you read my Letters; and this is &s;ufficient to make me devote the greate&s;t part of my time to writing, were I at liberty to follow my inclina|tions. But I have no will of my own, my dear Euphemia; I am a &s;lave to that of another. Reconcile this, if you can, with what I told you of the happy change in my fortune: or, if you can|not, wait patiently for my explanation,
<PB N="65" REF="65">
which will come in due time. But now hear Mr. Martin, who went on in this manner:</P>
<Q><P>THE doctors, Madam, finding my ma&s;ter in &s;o fine a way of recovery, told him, that change of air would &s;et him quite up again; and &s;o he accept|ed Mr. Greville's invitation to pa&s;s a week or two at his &s;eat. Mr. Greville being a &s;ingle man, my lady thought &s;he &s;hould be trouble&s;ome to him; &s;o &s;he &s;tayed behind at the Hall: but &s;he wept over my ma&s;ter when he took leave of her, as if they were never to meet again. However, &s;he quickly recovered her &s;pirits, and pa&s;&s;ed her time very merrily with Lady Flareit, and &s;ome other gay ladies in the neigh|bourhood. There was nothing but airings and vi&s;iting, and dining and &s;upping; and Colonel Flareit, Lady Flareit's kin&s;man, always made one; and he was &s;o very ob&s;equious to my lady, that her woman &s;aid, if my ma&s;|ter
<PB N="66" REF="66">
&s;hould happen to die, it would cer|tainly be a match; but my lady was wi&s;er, I believe, than that comes to; for Colonel Flareit, you know, Madam, has no e&s;tate.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, in the mid&s;t of all this jollity, news came, that my ma&s;ter, being out a hunting, had fallen from his hor&s;e, and was taken up dead. The whole family was in tears and lamenta|tion, but my lady was more com|po&s;ed, becau&s;e &s;he did not believe the report; "for if it was true," &s;he &s;aid, <Q>&s;he &s;hould have notice of it by a me&s;|&s;enger &s;ent expre&s;s by Mr. Greville.</Q> This &s;eemed likely; but, for all that, I was impatient to &s;et out for Greville Park, to know the truth: but it being very late in the evening when the news came, my lady ordered me not to &s;tir till the next morning, when I might &s;et out as &s;oon as I plea&s;ed. And now &s;he thought &s;it to make a &s;how of &s;or|row, and &s;hed a few tears before her
<PB N="67" REF="67">
woman and I. But, for all that, we thought we could perceive that &s;he would not be &s;orry to be a rich young widow.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, I pa&s;&s;ed an anxious night, Heaven knows! and the moment it was light I mounted and rode away.</P>
<P>BEING &s;till weak with my di&s;temper, I could not make as much ha&s;te as my impatience required; and at the very &s;econd &s;tage I &s;aw Mr. Greville's po&s;t|chai&s;e, and him&s;elf in it, drive into the inn-yard. I was now &s;eized with &s;uch a fit of trembling, that I could neither &s;it my hor&s;e nor alight, &s;o one of the ho&s;tlers helped me, and I followed Mr. Greville to a room where he was &s;it|ting. &mdash;<Q>Oh, Sir! my ma&s;ter, my ma&s;|ter!</Q> was all I could bring out. His very looks, however, relieved me in&s;tantly, as well as his words.'</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68"><Q>WHAT does the &s;impleton mean,</Q> s;aid he, <Q>by trembling and looking &s;o pale? What, you have heard of the accident then? &mdash;Well, your ma&s;|ter has got off for only a few &s;light brui&s;es.</Q> &mdash;"Heaven be prai&s;ed," &s;aid I, <Q>for this good news! but we heard that he had broke his neck, and all us at the Hall are in the deepe&s;t affliction.</Q> "How!" &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>Does your lady believe Sir John is dead?</Q> "Not ab&s;olutely, Sir," replied I; <Q>s;he &s;aid, if it was true, a me&s;&s;enger would be &s;ent expre&s;s to inform her, and no one had come yet.</Q>&mdash;"A wi&s;e woman," &s;aid Mr. Greville; <Q>&s;he was in the right not to be lavi&s;h of her tears upon an uncertainty: but, Martin,</Q> pur&s;ued he, after thinking a little, <Q>I have a mind to know how &s;he will take his death, when &s;he believes it to be certain. Sir John, poor man, believing his con&s;inement is likely to be long, though that is by no means the ca&s;e, was
<PB N="69" REF="69">
de&s;irous of his lady's company, &s;o I could do no le&s;s than offer my &s;ervice to conduct her to him, and that was the &s;ole motive of my journey: but now I am re&s;olved to have a little di|ver&s;ion from it. Can you keep a &s;e|cret, Martin?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I believe I can, Sir,</Q> &s;aid I; <Q>my ma&s;ter has tru&s;ted me with many.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Ah, I do not doubt it,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Greville, &s;haking his head: <Q>Well, then, my de&s;ign is, to tell your lady that the report of Sir John's death was but too true.</Q>&mdash;"Oh, Sir," cried I, <Q>you know how fond my lady is of her hu&s;band; this trial will be very hard upon her.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You are a rogue,</Q> &s;aid he, &s;miling, <Q>I &s;ee that; but you will be &s;ecret.</Q>&mdash;<Q>But Sir,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>your &s;ervants will be|tray the matter.</Q>&mdash;"Never fear that," &s;aid he; <Q>I will give them their in|&s;tructions; &s;o &s;end them up to me.</Q> I did &s;o; and after Mr. Greville had tutored them properly, we all &s;et out for the Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="70">MR. Greville, in con&s;ideration of my late illne&s;s, had the goodne&s;s to take me into the chai&s;e with him, and all the way he diverted him&s;elf with the &s;cheme he had formed, and with telling me what to &s;ay, and how to behave.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, we had &s;carce entered the avenue, when, Mr. Greville's car|riage and &s;ervants being perceived by one of our men, the whole family was in motion, and came crowding round us. "Is the &s;ad news true?" cried &s;e|veral voices at once. Mr. Greville's &s;ervants &s;hook their heads in a melan|choly way. "Alas! then it is too true," they all repeated, and ran back in great di&s;order into the hou&s;e, which they filled with their lamentations. Mr. Greville, alighting, &s;aid in a &s;o|lemn tone, <Q>If Lady Harley is at lei|&s;ure, let her be informed I am come.</Q> He followed the butler, who, with eyes full of tears, &s;hewed him into my ma&s;|ter's library, and withdrew to acquaint my lady.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="71">IT was with difficulty I could break from the &s;ervants, who hung upon me, lamenting, and inquiring&mdash;but I was curious to &s;ee how my lady would re|ceive Mr. Greville; &s;o I ha&s;tened af|ter him.</P>
<P>HE was &s;eated, and had taken a book; "for," &s;aid he to me, <Q>I cannot expect to have an audience &s;o &s;oon: the lady will take time to &s;ettle the face &s;he is to wear upon this trying occa&s;ion:</Q> and to be &s;ure, Madam, my lady was a full hour before &s;he &s;ent to de&s;ire Mr. Greville would be plea&s;ed to come to her in her dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>MR. Greville obeyed immediately, but with a &s;low &s;tep, and &s;olemn air. I attended him; but I believe I did not act my part &s;o well as his Honour; for my fellow-&s;ervants have &s;ince told me, that they thought my grief was not very violent. We found my lady half|lying
<PB N="72" REF="72">
on a &s;ettee, with a handkerchief at her eyes, &s;o that &s;he did not perceive our entrance. Her woman was &s;tand|ing clo&s;e by her with a &s;melling bottle, which &s;he offered her, and at the &s;ame time told her, Mr. Greville was there. My lady then, drawing a&s;ide her handkerchief, ju&s;t looked up, and crying, "Ah, Mr. Greville!" clapped it clo&s;e to her eyes again, and conti|nued &s;ilent.</P>
<P><Q>I CANNOT blame you, Madam; I cannot blame you,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Gre|ville; <Q>your grief is great, and &s;o is your cau&s;e for grief:&mdash;you have lo&s;t a good hu&s;band, but that is not all;&mdash; you have lo&s;t&mdash;</Q> At that word my lady &s;tarted, let fall her handkerchief, and fixed her eyes upon Mr. Greville, impatiently expecting him to proceed, for here the poor gentleman was &s;eized with a violent cough, which held him for two or three minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="73">ALL that time I ob&s;erved my lady heedfully: her colour went and came &mdash; &s;he &s;eemed hardly able to draw her breath, &s;till keeping her fixed looks upon Mr. Greville, who, recovering, went on:&mdash; <Q>Yes, Madam, as I was &s;aying, you have lo&s;t be&s;ide a good hu&s;band</Q>&mdash;My lady &s;eemed now ready to die with impatience, for Mr. Greville pau&s;ed, as if fearful of his cough returning; then &s;lowly added, <Q>You have lo&s;t a friend, a protector, an amiable companion;&mdash;Sir John was all this to you, Madam; and how dear you were to him, you will (if you do not know it already) &s;oon know.</Q></P>
<P>MY lady was again at lei&s;ure for her tears: &s;he re&s;umed her handkerchief, and Mr. Greville his fine &s;peeches, which la&s;ted till I was de&s;ired to let my lady know that dinner was &s;erved. Mr. Greville then offered his hand to lead her down, but &s;he declined it, &s;aying, &s;he mu&s;t entreat him to di&s;|pen&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="74">
with her attending him at table, &s;ince her melancholy &s;ituation would plead her excu&s;e. Mr. Greville al|lowed it; and only be&s;eeching her to moderate her &s;orrow, if po&s;&s;ible, bow|ed, and quitted the room.</P>
<P>I THEN advanced, and a&s;ked if her lady&s;hip had any commands for me? She an&s;wered haughtily, "No!" and I followed Mr. Greville, who, &s;eeing me enter the dining-parlour, &s;aid to the other &s;ervants, <Q>You need not wait, my lads, my old friend here will be &s;ufficient to attend me:</Q> accordingly they left the room.</P>
<P>MR. Greville made a &s;ign to me to fa&s;ten the door, which I did; <Q>And now,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>let me have my laugh out, for I am almo&s;t &s;trangled.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT diverted Mr. Greville mo&s;t, Madam, was, that he had thrown my lady quite off her guard when he
<PB N="75" REF="75">
made her apprehend a greater lo&s;s than that of her hu&s;band; for to be &s;ure, Madam, my lady was quite in earne&s;t then, and looked frighted out of her wits; for &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, as Mr. Greville intended &s;he &s;hould, that my ma&s;ter had made &s;ome alteration in his will before the accident happened.</P></Q>
<P>BUT here I mu&s;t drop Mr. Martin and his narration for the pre&s;ent, for I have only time to make up my letter, which you mu&s;t acknowledge is of a tolerable length; therefore adieu my dear Euphe|mia. Alas, the moment is approach|ing when I mu&s;t bid you adieu for a long, an indefinite time.

<P>SURELY then you mean to excite me to virtue by a new &s;ubtilty, and the prai&s;es you give me are but di&s;gui&s;ed exhortations. Take notice, this is the con&s;truction I &s;hall put upon all &s;uch language from you; and if you would not be thought rather to dictate than to commend, avoid it for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="78">BUT to &s;hew you that I am as little di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to unju&s;t cen&s;ure as to unde&s;erved prai&s;e, I will not receive patiently your charge of being a pro|mi&s;e-breaker. Every thing that is pro|mi&s;ed and not done, is not a violation of faith or breaking of promi&s;e, &s;ince acci|dent has &s;o much, to do in the ordering of &s;mall events. The large packet that will &s;oon follow this letter will convince you that I have been employed in obey|ing your commands; and I have given you my Hi&s;tory, as you call it, down to the pre&s;ent moment, without inter|ruption, that you may no longer be ig|norant of the cau&s;es and motives of the mo&s;t important tran&s;action of my life, and from which that life mu&s;t hereafter take all its colour.</P>
<P>I HAVE been very much entertained with your friend Martin's relation, and like his manner extremely well, which your memory has &s;o faithfully pre&s;erved; but I am not quite plea&s;ed with the me|thod
<PB N="79" REF="79">
Mr. Greville hit upon to reali&s;e his doubts of Lady Harley's &s;incerity. He laid him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of telling a direct fal&s;ehood, and of &s;upporting that fal&s;ehood by many little artifices, not ea&s;ily practi&s;ed by an ingenuous mind. But your men of wit and ridicule have a very relaxed moral on certain occa&s;ions. A man of plain good &s;en&s;e &s;tarts at the&s;e humorous violations of truth, and thinks his reputation would be ruined for ever by &s;uch bold flights.</P>
<P>BUT I ought to remember that it is my dear Maria's friend who&s;e conduct I am cen&s;uring, and that it was for her &s;ervice chiefly he devi&s;ed this &s;tratagem: therefore, though I cannot ab&s;olve, yet I am willing to pardon; for I confe&s;s my integrity is &s;carcely proof again&s;t &s;o high a bribe. My dear friend, adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AND do you really re&s;olve to put &s;uch a &s;trange con&s;truction upon the ju&s;t tribute paid by a friend to your merit? Mu&s;t my prai&s;es be con&s;idered as di&s;gui&s;ed exhortations? Let me tell you, you avoid pre&s;umption by a con|trary extreme, &s;ince envy it&s;elf would give you that which your own mode&s;ty takes away.</P>
<P>BUT, notto offend you further by dwell|ing on this theme, you &s;hall now have the remainder of Mr. Martin's relation; his &s;implicity plea&s;es you; and I have been careful to make no alteration in his &s;tyle and manner: thus then he went on:&mdash;</P>
<Q><PB N="81" REF="81"><P>MR. Greville, as &s;oon as he had dined, &s;ent to beg my lady would fa|vour him with a &s;hort interview before his departure, which he &s;aid the occa|&s;ion required &s;hould be immediately. Accordingly he was admitted to &s;ee her. He told her, that he intended to get as far on his way home that night as he po&s;&s;ibly could, and would call upon Mr. Mainwaring, and the executor, to &s;ettle all matters relating to the fune|ral. He de&s;ired to know if her lady|&s;hip had any particular commands to favour him with: to which &s;he an&s;wer|ed, <Q>Pray, Mr. Greville, do not con|&s;ult me upon the&s;e &s;ad affairs; I leave all to your di&s;cretion.</Q></P>
<P>"BUT, Madam," &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>I earne&s;tly recommend it to you to arm your&s;elf with fortitude; the body mu&s;t be brought here to-morrow or next day at farthe&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="82">"As you plea&s;e," &s;aid my lady, <Q>but I entreat you &s;pare me any further di&s;cour&s;e upon this melancholy &s;ub|ject.</Q></P>
<P>ALL this, Madam, Mr. Greville told me was &s;aid with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure of look and accent; &s;o, to be &s;hort, Ma|dam, he took his leave; and, as my ague now returned with great violence, this &s;erved for a good rea&s;on for my not going with him, &s;o I went up to my chamber; but, as I afterwards found, my lady did not know I was in the hou&s;e, for &s;he concluded I was gone with Mr. Greville.</P>
<P>THAT very evening Lady Flareit came to condole with my lady, and &s;upper was &s;erved up in her dre&s;&s;ing-room; and nobody was allowed to wait but her woman, in whom my lady had great confidence, which &s;he did not de&s;erve, for &s;he was very deceit&s;ul. Now it hap|pened
<PB N="83" REF="83">
that my name was mentioned upon &s;ome occa&s;ion or other, upon which Mrs. Wil&s;on &s;aid I was very ill.</P>
<P>MY lady was much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear I was in the hou&s;e, and declared I &s;hould not &s;tay another moment in it. <Q>He is a bu&s;y meddling fellow,</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q>he gained his ma&s;ter's good will by his fawning and his lies. Poor Sir John had no very &s;trong head, and even this paltry fellow could make a dupe of him. Go, Wil&s;on, and tell him to leave the Hall immediately.</Q> Mrs. Wil&s;on told her that I was ill, and gone to bed.</P>
<P>"No matter," &s;aid my lady; <Q>he may go to the next inn; he is rich enough to procure accommodation any where&mdash;I am determined he &s;hall not &s;tay in the hou&s;e&mdash;I am mi&s;tre&s;s here, and will be obeyed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="84">"LORD, Madam!" &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on, as &s;he told me afterwards, <Q>does your lady&s;hip con&s;ider what a clamour this will make: every one knows my late good ma&s;ter had a great regard for Mr. Martin; he has &s;erved him faithfully many years, you know Madam, and faithful &s;ervants ought not to be u&s;ed &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>"YOUR late <HI>good</HI> ma&s;ter," &s;aid my lady, <Q>has well rewarded him for his &s;ervices, &s;uch as they were. But methinks you are very bold to &s;tand arguing with me thus; go and deliver my orders&mdash; tell him to be gone: and here,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, kicking a little French dog that my ma&s;ter was very fond of &mdash; <Q>bid him take this animal with him. This was a favourite too, and was allowed to &s;narl, and bark, and &s;poil the carpets, and no one, not even my&s;elf, dur&s;t find fault with him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="85">MRS. Wil&s;on took up the dog, and came to my room, and told me all that had pa&s;&s;ed. I was thunder&s;hook in a manner; and making no an&s;wer, &s;he a&s;ked me what &s;he &s;hould &s;ay to my lady?</P>
<P>"GIVE my duty to her lady&s;hip," &s;aid I, <Q>and tell her that I will obey her com|mands to-morrow morning as &s;oon as it is day, but for this night I hope &s;he will excu&s;e me; and as for the dog, I will take care of it for my dear ma&s;|ter's &s;ake; and &s;o good night, Mrs. Wil&s;on.</Q> She &s;miled, and &s;aid I acted quite right; &s;o &s;he went away, and I bolted the door after her, and went to bed.</P>
<P>I KNOW not how my lady took this an&s;wer, for early the next morning I got up, and, finding my&s;elf much bet|ter, I went to the &s;table, made the groom &s;addle my hor&s;e, and I &s;et out for Mr. Greville's &s;eat.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="86"> I ARRIVED there the next day about noon, and had the &s;atisfaction to hear that my ma&s;ter was quite well; for in|deed his hurt had been but very incon|&s;iderable. I de&s;ired Mr. Greville's valet to tell his ma&s;ter that I was come, and begged to &s;peak to him in private be|fore I waited on my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>MR. Greville ordered me to come to him in his &s;tudy, and expre&s;&s;ed much &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing me. I told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and how my lady had, turned me out of doors, and the little dog with me.</P>
<P>MR. Greville rubbed his hands, and cried out joyfully, <Q>So, this goes well; &s;he has &s;hewn the cloven foot: what will my old friend &s;ay to this?</Q></P>
<P>"DOES my ma&s;ter know, Sir, &s;aid I, <Q>of the trick you have put upon my, lady?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="87">"OH, yes," &s;aid he, <Q>and laughs at the je&s;t: but I fancy the &s;tory you have to tell will put &s;ome &s;erious thoughts into his head. Come, I will bring you to him.</Q></P>
<P>I FOLLOWED Mr. Greville into my ma&s;ter's chamber, who was walking; about, and looked &s;o well that my joy quite overpowered me, and I bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"WELL, Martin," &s;aid my ma&s;ter, <Q>I believe you are glad to find me alive: but what brings you here? I heard you was not well: and why have you brought my poor Fidelle with you?</Q> added he, care&s;&s;ing the dog, who had got out of my arms, and was jumping about him.</P>
<P>I CAST down my eyes, and was &s;ilent, not knowing how to tell the mat|ter. My ma&s;ter then perceived that &s;omething extraordinary had happened,
<PB N="88" REF="88">
and &s;aid ha&s;tily, <Q>Why don't you an&s;wer me, Martin?</Q></P>
<P>"I BELIEVE I mu&s;t an&s;wer for him," &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>for the poor man is half a&s;hamed of the matter; but the truth is, my lady, firmly believing that &s;he is now whole and &s;ole &s;ove|reign, has, in the plenitude of her power, taken upon her to turn your faithful &s;ervant, and your favourite dog, out of doors.</Q></P>
<P>"How is this?" &s;aid my ma&s;ter, eagerly: then &s;uddenly &s;topping, he mu&s;ed a little, and added, with a &s;mile, <Q>She has played you trick for trick; but con&s;idering that Martin was ill, this was carrying the je&s;t too far. But, pray what cau&s;e did &s;he a&s;&s;ign for this treatment?</Q></P>
<P><Q>MY lady accu&s;es me of being a &s;py, a bu&s;y body, and a mi&s;chief-maker, Sir,</Q> &s;aid I; <Q>and as for the dog, her
<PB N="89" REF="89">
lady&s;hip makes heavy complaints of him, for &s;uch faults as dogs are often guilty of, to be &s;ure; but I never thought Fidelle was one of tho&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>MY ma&s;ter now laughed heartily, at which, I thought, Mr. Greville looked a little &s;illy. <Q>I &s;ee you take this mat|ter right,</Q> &s;aid he to my ma&s;ter, in a peevi&s;h tone.</P>
<P>"WHY yes," &s;aid my ma&s;ter, <Q>I be|lieve I do: but come, I am re&s;olved to act a part in this farce; I find my|&s;elf &s;trong enough to undertake a longer journey than that to my own hou&s;e; &s;o, if you plea&s;e, we will &s;et out to-morrow; and I will &s;urpri&s;e Lady Harley with the gho&s;t of her hu&s;band.</Q></P>
<P>"WITH all my heart," &s;aid Mr. Gre|ville, <Q>but if your &s;udden appearance &s;hould frighten her into fits, I am guiltle&s;s of the con&s;equences; for I
<PB N="90" REF="90">
do a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he thinks you are ac|tually dead.</Q></P>
<P><Q>INDEED I am per&s;uaded &s;he has been laughing at you all this time,</Q> &s;aid my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>"WELL," replied Mr. Greville, <Q>I have no more to &s;ay; but I hope you will have your je&s;t too.</Q></P>
<P>"THAT is what I intend," &s;aid my ma&s;ter. He then ordered me to go and take care of my&s;elf; and I with|drew, a little apprehen&s;ive of his dif|plea&s;ure, becau&s;e he did not take this matter as Mr. Greville expected.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I had an opportunity of &s;peaking to Mr. Greville that evening, and he a&s;&s;ured me, my ma&s;ter was not angry with any of us; that was his phra&s;e. "Though &s;ome of us," &s;ays he, <Q>certainly de&s;erve that he &s;hould be &s;o. He talks of what has pa&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="91">
very plea&s;antly; but I think I can per|ceive he has &s;ome &s;erious thoughts about it, for he is often pen&s;ive and &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P>WELL, Madam, my ma&s;ter &s;et out next day at noon, with Mr. Gre|ville, for the Hall. He would have had me &s;tay behind a day or two to recover my&s;elf; but I told him, I found my&s;elf well enough to attend him: and truly I would not upon any account have mi&s;&s;ed the &s;cene I expected to &s;ee.</P>
<P>WE lay that night at a friend of Mr. Greville's, who had heard the report of my ma&s;ter's death, and was rejoiced to find it without foundation. We left this gentleman's hou&s;e &s;o late in the day, that it was night before we reached the Hall. No one took any notice of my ma&s;ter, who was wrapt up in his great coat and his hat &s;louched; he followed Mr. Greville up &s;tairs, who had a&s;ked for my lady, and was told &s;he was in her own apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="92">A SERVANT announced Mr. Greville to my lady's woman, who was in wait|ing; and Mr. Greville, without cere|mony, followed her into my lady's dre&s;&s;|ing room, my ma&s;ter being clo&s;e at his heels; and to be &s;ure, Madam, there was my lady, not mourning like a &s;or|rowful widow, but &s;itting at &s;upper with Lady Flareit and the Colonel, and they all &s;eemed very cheerful.</P>
<P><Q>YOUR &s;ervant, your &s;ervant, good people,</Q> &s;aid my ma&s;ter, gaily taking off his hat, <Q>will you permit a couple of hungry travellers to partake with you?</Q></P>
<P>MY lady, who had &s;eemed lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment and terror at the &s;ound of his voice, no &s;ooner &s;aw his face, than &s;he &s;creamed aloud and fell into a faint|ing fit. Lady Flareit cried out, <Q>A gho&s;t!</Q> hid her eyes with her apron, and trembled like an a&s;pen-leaf; and the Colonel, &s;tarting up, clapped his
<PB N="93" REF="93">
hand "in&s;tinctively," aye, that was Mr. Greville's word, upon his &s;word, and, opening his eyes as wide as he could, &s;tood &s;taring at my ma&s;ter from a cor|ner of the room, who was very bu&s;y in endeavouring to recover my lady, which at la&s;t, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her woman, who &s;prinkled her face plentifully with water, he effected.</P>
<P>BUT as &s;oon as &s;he opened her eyes, and &s;aw my ma&s;ter, &s;he &s;eemed ready to relap&s;e; upon which Lady Flareit, who was now, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Gre|ville, quite recovered from her fright, approached, and taking her hand, &s;aid, <Q>Come, Lady Harley, let me lead you to your chamber; Sir John, this was a cruel je&s;t.</Q>&mdash;<Q>It was all Grevslle's doings,</Q> &s;aid my ma&s;ter; <Q>therefore, pray, my dear,</Q> &s;aid he to my lady, who went tottering out of the room, leaning upon Lady Flareit's arms, <Q>do not be too much di&s;compo&s;ed, but re|turn
<PB N="94" REF="94">
again &s;oon, if you would not &s;poil my &s;upper.</Q></P>
<P>COLONEL Flareit then came forward, looking a little fooli&s;h, I thought, as if he did not know how to take my ma&s;ter's gaiety. <Q REND="margQuotes">"Come, Colonel," &s;aid my ma&s;|ter, come and fini&s;h your &s;upper, otherwi&s;e I &s;hall think you are &s;till afraid.</Q></P>
<P>"AFRAID, Sir!" &s;aid the Colonel; "Aye, afraid," &s;aid my matter; <Q>why Co|lonel a &s;oldier may be afraid of a gho&s;t, without any di&s;paragement to his cou|rage: but after all,</Q> continued my ma&s;ter, laughing, <Q>you have all acted your parts very well; and my friend Greville need not boa&s;t much of the &s;ucce&s;s of his trick; for I am confident, there is not one of you that was im|po&s;ed upon for a &s;ingle moment, by the &s;tory he invented of my death; therefore the laugh, I think, is fairly turned upon him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95">THE Colonel &s;aid not a word; and Mr. Greville &s;eemed utterly at a lo&s;s how to under&s;tand my ma&s;ter, &s;o he continued to eat in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>AT length Lady Flareit came in, looking very grave; and was going to &s;peak, but my ma&s;ter prevented her; crying out, <Q>So, Lady Harley is not with you, I &s;ee; &s;he would fain carry on the je&s;t a little further, and per&s;uade me that &s;he really thought I was dead; but I know better; &s;he is not &s;o good an actre&s;s as &s;he thinks; and yet, after all, &s;he impo&s;ed upon Greville, I believe.</Q></P>
<P>LADY Flareit now cleared up all on a &s;udden. "Ah," &s;aid &s;he to my ma&s;|ter, <Q>you have found us out; we in|tended to mortify you by our pre|tended indifference; but, however, your &s;udden appearance &s;urpri&s;ed Lady Harley; you know &s;he has very weak nerves; &s;he is really not well,
<PB N="96" REF="96">
and is gone to bed.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I am &s;orry for that,</Q> &s;aid my ma&s;ter, <Q>I hoped &s;he would have joined the laugh again&s;t this plotter here,</Q> clapping Mr. Gre|ville on the back.</P>
<P>LADY Flareit now returned to my lady; telling the Colonel, that &s;he would go home in a quarter of an hour. Mrs. Wil&s;on informed me, that this time was &s;pent in clo&s;e conver&s;ation between the two ladies, which &s;he could not hear di&s;tinctly; but Lady Flareit &s;eemed en|deavouring to per&s;uade my lady to &s;omething. She was &s;ent to acquaint the Colonel, that her lady &s;hip was ready; &s;o he took leave of my ma&s;ter and Mr. Greville, and they went away together.</P>
<P>EARLY the next morning, I &s;aw my ma&s;ter and Mr. Greville walking to|gether upon the lawn, &s;eemingly in deep di&s;cour&s;e. When they came in to breakfa&s;t, my lady &s;ent her woman with an apology, for her not being able to at|tend
<PB N="97" REF="97">
them, having had a very indif|ferent night. My ma&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed great concern for her illne&s;s; and de&s;ired her woman to let him know when &s;he was up, that he might go and &s;ee her: then ha&s;tily turning to me, he &s;aid, <Q>Get ready immediately to go for Worden and Gra&s;p; I have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for them to do, which I think ought not to be delayed, le&s;t I &s;hould die in good earne&s;t.</Q> Mrs. Wil&s;on heard the&s;e words, and hurried away to tell her lady; and I was as eager to execute my commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I BROUGHT them both with me to the Hall. My ma&s;ter was in my lady's chamber when they arrived; and as &s;oon as he had notice of it, he joined them in his &s;tudy. Mr. Greville was there; and they continued a long time together.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter detained the two lawyers to dinner; at which my lady, being &s;till indi&s;po&s;ed, did not appear. The next
<PB N="98" REF="98">
morning, Mr. Greville &s;et out for his own &s;eat: he &s;hook my hand, as I at|tended him to his carriage, &s;aying, in a low voice, <Q>All goes right, hone&s;t Mar|tin.</Q> I under&s;tood his Honour, and was heartily glad of it.</P>
<P>WHEN Mr. Greville was gone, my lady appeared at table as u&s;ual; but &s;o &s;ullen, &s;o &s;ilent, that my ma&s;ter could hardly get a word out of her, though he was very complai&s;ant and civil to her. Mrs. Wil&s;on told me, that &s;he could hear Lady Flareit, who &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed a day coming to &s;ee her, often chide her for her behaviour; telling her, &s;he was wrong, quite wrong: but my lady could not be per&s;uaded to alter it; continuing cold, re&s;erved, and even peevi&s;h. But my ma&s;ter &s;eemed to take no notice of this &s;trange alteration in her manner towards him: he was often talking of you, Madam, and plea&s;ing him&s;elf with the expectation of &s;eeing you &s;oon. He ordered your apart|&s;et
<PB N="99" REF="99">
of wrought dre&s;&s;ing-plate for your toilet came from London, which my lady &s;carcely conde&s;cended to look at; &s;aying coldly, when my ma&s;ter a&s;ked her opinion, that it was mighty pretty.</P>
<P>A GREAT alteration now appeared in my lady's looks; and it was apparent that her &s;ecret di&s;contents had hurt her health. My ma&s;ter propo&s;ed to her change of air, and a journey to Paris; &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would rather go to &s;ome of the watering places. But &s;he grew vi&s;i|bly wor&s;e, and at length was &s;eized with a violent fever. The phy&s;icians had very little hopes from the fir&s;t; and all their arguments and intreaties could not prevail upon her to be bled: &s;o &s;he died, as one may &s;ay, by her own fault.</P>
<P>MY ma&s;ter was very kind to her dur|ing her illne&s;s; but &s;he was &s;eldom &s;en|&s;ible, and &s;carce ever &s;poke. The day &s;he died, he continued &s;hut up in his
<PB N="100" REF="100">
clo&s;et for &s;everal hours; and the next morning &s;et out for Mr. Greville's, &s;eat. She was buried in the fa|mily vault with great &s;olemnity; but, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, not much lamented; for her lady &s;hip was not very charitable to the poor; and &s;he always behaved to the tenants and &s;mall gentry in the neighbourhood with great haughtine&s;s.</P></Q>
<P>HERE Mr. Martin ended his narra|tion, which took up two or three of my evenings in li&s;tening to; and I have given it you almo&s;t in his very words. What more I have to tell you on this &s;ubject mu&s;t be deferred till my next. But now adieu! my ever dear Euphe|mia.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL never for the future rank your uncle with men of common under&s;tanding; his whole conduct with regard to Lady Harley, on the mo&s;t trying occa&s;ion imaginable, di&s;plays a fund of good &s;en&s;e and philo&s;ophy, rarely to be met with in per&s;ons, who, like him, have &s;pent &s;o great a part of their lives in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>How nicely has he &s;teered between two extremes, equally fatal to his re|putation. Had he appeared in&s;en&s;ible of her levities, and indifferent to the ungrateful returns &s;he made to his af|fection, he would have pa&s;&s;ed for a dupe: had he avowed his re&s;entment, he would have authori&s;ed &s;u&s;picions that
<PB N="102" REF="102">
would have ruined her character, and fixed ridicule upon his own; he e&s;caped both the&s;e rocks by the mo&s;t ma&s;terly management imaginable, and neither malice nor ridicule can find a &s;haft to hit him.</P>
<P>I AM not &s;urpri&s;ed at the de&s;pair which Lady Harley &s;eems to have fallen into. The mo&s;t common view per&s;ons have, when they commit imprudent actions, is the probability of always finding out &s;ome re&s;ource or other: but Lady Harley, in this ca&s;e, could have no &s;uch hope; &s;he had fixed her hu&s;|band's opinion of her irrevocably, and the very methods he u&s;ed to render her le&s;s contemptible in the eyes of the world, &s;erved only to le&s;&s;en her more in her own. But peace be to her a&s;hes, and oblivion to her memory!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WISH I could with any propriety have &s;hewn my uncle &s;ome part of your la&s;t letter; even the wi&s;e might be pardoned for indulging a little vanity at receiving prai&s;es from judgment and &s;incerity like yours; but you will ea&s;ily conceive this would not have been pro|per, at lea&s;t at this time, after what I am going to tell you.</P>
<P>MARTIN having informed him that he had obeyed his commands, and given me a very particular (and you mu&s;t own, my friend, that it <HI>was</HI> a very particular) account of all that had
<PB N="105" REF="105">
happened during my ab&s;ence, my uncle &s;poke to me in this manner:</P>
<P><Q>You have heard from Martin &s;ome very intere&s;ting circum&s;tances relat|ing to your aunt and me; you have candour and good &s;en&s;e; I doubt not but you will judge rightly of my con|duct. I only intreat you never to mention Lady Harley to me in private, and in public be as re&s;erved on that &s;ubject as I am. Mr. Greville,</Q> he added, <Q>is certainly your friend; you owe him &s;ome acknowldgments;</Q> and the&s;e, my dear, I did not fail to pay him the very fir&s;t opportunity, with an effu&s;ion of heart which convinced him of my gratitude.</P>
<P>I WAS obliged to li&s;ten to &s;ome hu|mrous &s;allies on my aunt's account, and even to &s;mile at them, for indeed it would have been very difficult to re|frain; however, he always &s;pared my uncle, which, con&s;idering his fondne&s;s
<PB N="106" REF="106">
for raillery, was an in&s;tance of &s;elf|denial that had &s;ome merit in it.</P>
<P>MY aunt's woman was &s;till in the hou&s;e; &s;he expected to have made her court to me by throwing out &s;ome reflections upon her late lady, and by making an ample di&s;covery of all &s;he knew; but I &s;ilenced her by a &s;evere look, and an ab&s;olute command never to &s;peak to me on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>MY uncle left it to me to do as I plea&s;ed with regard to her; I had rea&s;on to think her very deceitful, and incapa|ble of being true to any one; I re&s;olved to di&s;charge her immediately; &s;o I gave her all her late lady's clothes and linen, with what money &s;he had in her pockets when &s;he died, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, to the great joy of the &s;ervants, who had all of them, at one time or other, experienced her treachery.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="107">You will call Mr. Greville a bold man, when I tell you he would read your la&s;t letter, notwith &s;tanding all I could do to hinder him; he came in when I was writing, and &s;aw it lying on my table, and actually read it through; and this is what he &s;aid when he returned it to me: <Q>No mode&s;ty is able to re&s;i&s;t the prai&s;es that come from your amiable friend; and although I have hitherto thought vanity a ridiculous quality, yet I prote&s;t I &s;hould take a plea&s;ure in being corrupted by her.</Q></P>
<P>HE pre&s;t me much to &s;hew my uncle what you &s;aid of him; but I pleaded his ab&s;olute command not to mention Lady Harley to him; and he agreed that he ought to be obeyed.</P>
<P>THIS unlooked for intru&s;ion of Mr. Greville's will teach me caution; I will always fa&s;ten my door for the future when I &s;it down to write to you. But I will now explain to you what I meant
<PB N="108" REF="108">
when I told you my uncle was kinder to me than ever, and yet I had no will of my own, but was a &s;lave to that of an|other.</P>
<P>IT is that kindne&s;s of his that has en|&s;laved my will, my dear Euphemia, that has loaded me with a debt of gra|titude which I can never be able to pay, and has fixed &s;hackles upon my mind which it is impo&s;&s;ible for me ever to unloo&s;e, Mark the method he took to produce this voluntary &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>SOME little time after my return from France, Mr. Greville being upon a vi|&s;it at the Hall, my uncle &s;ent for me into his &s;tudy, where he was &s;itting with his friend; they had papers lying upon the table before them, one of which, upon my entrance, my uncle took, and, pre&s;enting it to Mr. Greville, <Q>Here, Sir,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>is a deed of gift to my niece of the greate&s;t part of my per|&s;onal e&s;tate, amounting to about twenty
<PB N="109" REF="109">
thou&s;and pounds, which, as her guar|dian and tru&s;tee, I lodge in your hands. It is all placed on govern|ment &s;ecurities, for the intere&s;t of which you are to be accountable to her only from the pre&s;ent moment, and to pay into her hands for her &s;ole u&s;e and benefit.</Q></P>
<P>'BE not &s;urpri&s;ed,' pur&s;ued he, 'child,' taking my hand, and leading me, all amazed and &s;peechle&s;s, to a chair next his own, <Q>I believe you have a &s;incere affection for me, and I am willing to enjoy the plea&s;ure this thought gives me, pure and unmixed with the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a doubt. What I in|tended to bequeath you at my death I give you now, irrevocably, that you may be free and ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of your&s;elf, and that having nothing more to hope, or any thing to fear, from me, your actions may be as uncon&s;trained as your thoughts, and your real affection for me liable to no mi&s;con&s;tructions.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="110">IT was ea&s;y to perceive, by this conduct of my uncle, my dear Euphemia, what an impre&s;&s;ion Lady Harley's duplicity and artifice had made upon his mind, and how much he apprehended being thought the dupe of female &s;ubtilty a &s;econd time. His favourable opinion of me was al&s;o evident; and this was the point to which, as I conceived, de|licacy obliged me only to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>MY heart was full, but I endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s my emotions; and taking his hand, which I re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ed, while an involuntary tear at the &s;ame time dropped upon it, <Q>I am obliged to you, Sir,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>not &s;o much for making me rich, or for making me rich before my time, but for putting it in my power to &s;hew you</Q>&mdash;<Q>I un|der&s;tand you, my dear niece,</Q> &s;aid he, ha&s;tily interrupting me,&mdash; <Q>we under|&s;tand one another, I believe, and we &s;hall both be the happier for it. Would to Heaven,</Q> added he, with &s;ome emo|tion,
<PB N="111" REF="111">
<Q>that the e&s;tate of my family, which falls to a collateral branch which I have no rea&s;on to love, could have been your's likewi&s;e.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Come, no more of this,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>my fair ward here will have enough of that pelf, which, as Pope &s;ays,
<Q>Buys the &s;ex a tyrant in it&s;elf.</Q></Q></P>
<P>MR. Greville very judiciou&s;ly end ea voured to give the conver&s;ation a gayer turn, to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ieve my uncle and me from the very awkward &s;ituation we found our&s;elves in, while he was afraid of hearing acknowledgments, which my full heart left me not the power of ex|pre&s;&s;ing. And thus, my friend, has the independence my uncle be&s;towed on me been the beginning of my &s;lavery, for I cannot, I ought not, to have any will but that of a benefactor who has acted with &s;uch uncommon genero&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="112">THE power to follow my inclinations is &s;ecured to me, but my will is fettered by the obligations I lie under. Thus, for in&s;tance, my heart impels me to fly to you, to &s;ooth, to comfort, to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly have a&s;ked his permi&s;|&s;ion for a &s;hort ab&s;ence, if he had not, by making me my own mi&s;tre&s;s, deprived him&s;elf, as he thinks, of the power of refu&s;ing; and my company being now more nece&s;&s;ary to him than ever, I cannot give the lea&s;t hint that I have a wi&s;h that way, for fear of lay|ing him under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing what may be di&s;agreeable to him. But perhaps his own good fen&s;e may &s;ug|ge&s;t to him to offer what I cannot a&s;k, and then you may depend upon &s;eeing me in London.</P>
<P>I HAVE this moment received the long|expected packet; but I mu&s;t rein in my impatience, and not open it till I re|tire for the night; for this whole day I

<HEAD>LETTER XII. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I continue my little nar|rative, I mu&s;t entreat you, my dear Maria, not to &s;uffer the&s;e papers to be &s;een by any per&s;on but your&s;elf; they will contain a faithful account of my affairs, and give you a ju&s;t picture of my &s;ituation: and con&s;equently I &s;hall be obliged to touch upon the faults of one who, from the near relation in which he &s;tands to me, has claims upon my ten|derne&s;s and re&s;pect, which even tho&s;e faults cannot di&s;pen&s;e with me from al|lowing him. Mine, I know, your friend|&s;hip would &s;pare and conceal; and he, being a part of my&s;elf, for him I expect the &s;ame indulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="115">
I HAVE already repeated what Mrs. Ben&s;on told me concerning my father's imprudent management of his affairs, the con&s;equence of which has involved his family in ruin. My mother, always gentle and kind, endeavoured to palliate tho&s;e errors by which &s;he was &s;o great a &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing, &s;aid &s;he, more com|mendable than genero&s;ity, but nothing ought le&s;s to be &s;tretched too far. Mr. Lumley &s;erved his friends with too little attention to his own ability, which, to|gether with other imprudences, pro|duced that bitter remor&s;e which &s;hort|ened his days.</P>
<P>HER tears flowed fa&s;t at the&s;e words; I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my own emotions that I might comfort her, and endeavoured to detach her thoughts from the melan|choly idea, by giving her a detail of the inequality of Mrs. Highmore's beha|viour to me during the fir&s;t and the la&s;t days of my re&s;idence with her, which
<PB N="116" REF="116">
the wreck of our fortunes now enabled me to account for.</P>
<P>My mother &s;miled at my &s;tory; and taking two letters out of her pocket|book, put them into my hand. <Q>Here are two letters from Mrs. Highmore,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>of different dates: the fir&s;t is to Mrs. Lumley in affluence; the &s;e|cond to the &s;ame Mrs. Lumley in di&s;|tre&s;s; read them.</Q> I did &s;o, and here is what they contained.</P>

<P>I AM &s;incerely &s;orry, my very good friend, for your late lo&s;s, which is attended with &s;uch dreadful con&s;e|quences to your affairs. Your daugh|ter takes on greatly for her father's death, but we keep her in ignorance of the re&s;t of her misfortunes&mdash;again&s;t my judgment, indeed; for it moves

</LETTER>
<P>My mother an&s;wered this extraordinary epi&s;tle no otherwi&s;e than by cancelling a
<PB N="119" REF="119">
note for &s;ixty pounds, which Mrs. High|more had borrowed of her about a year before, and enclo&s;ing it in a cover, which contained only the&s;e words: <Q>Mrs. Lumley's compliments, and de&s;ires Mrs. Highmore will accept the en|clo&s;ed as payment for her daughter's and her governe&s;s board for five weeks.</Q></P>
<P>THIS billet was &s;ent by a porter to Mrs. Highmore's hou&s;e in town, whi|ther we had heard &s;he was come, with orders not to &s;tay for an an&s;wer. She came her&s;elf a few days afterwards to vi&s;it my mother, who pleaded indi&s;po|&s;ition, and refu&s;ed to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>MRS. Highmore's behaviour was imi|tated by many other per&s;ons of our ac|quaintance, who&s;e cool kindne&s;s, and con&s;trained civility, marked too well the change of our fortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="120">SOME of our relations were of high rank; and the&s;e kept us at a di&s;tance by their very ceremonious behaviour, Some were only rich, and to them po|verty appeared rather a crime than a misfortune; &s;o that in &s;trict morality they were obliged to treat us with great coldne&s;s and re&s;erve.</P>
<P>My mother appeared calm and Un|ruffled by this general depravity. <Q>Per|&s;ons of quicker &s;en&s;ibility than my|&s;elf,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>would, on this occa|&s;ion, complain of the world; but I &s;hall content my&s;elf with forgetting it.</Q></P>
<P>HAVING &s;ettled all her affairs in Lon|don, we retired to a &s;mall hou&s;e, which my mother had taken in a neighbouring town, and furni&s;hed with a &s;implicity &s;uitable to her fortune, and a neatne&s;s that gave elegance to that &s;implicity.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on refu&s;ed the part of go|verne&s;s to a young lady of high di&s;tinc|tion,
<PB N="121" REF="121">
in order to accompany us in this retreat. 'I have an income,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>which, though &s;mall, is &s;ufficient to prevent my being an incumbrance to you. I acquired part of it in your &s;ervice; and, I will never quit you while my attendance can be either u&s;eful or agreeable to you.</Q></P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily imagine, my dear Ma|ria, how acceptable &s;uch an in&s;tance of faithful attachment mu&s;t be to my mo|ther, at a time when &s;he &s;eemed for&s;aken by all the world. She embraced, and thanked her with tears of tenderne&s;s and joy; yet repre&s;ented to her, that her intere&s;t required &s;he &s;hould accept the advantageous propo&s;al that was made to her.</P>
<P>'HONOUR, gratitude, and friend&s;hip,' replied &s;he, <Q>impel me to attach my|&s;elf to you, and my beloved pupil; in doing &s;o I find my intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="122">WE were &s;oon &s;ettled in our new habitation: one maid-&s;ervant compo&s;ed our whole equipage. We worked, we read, we dre&s;&s;ed our little garden&mdash;all was peace, friend&s;hip, and mutual com|placency.</P>
<P>'I SEE,' &s;aid I one day to my mother, <Q>that one may cea&s;e to be rich without being unhappy</Q>&mdash;<Q>A life led in tran|quillity, and with judgment,</Q> replied my mother, <Q>which is the work of rea&s;on, is preferable to one half of tho&s;e &s;ud|den and great &s;ucce&s;&s;es which the world admires, and which are &s;carce ever the rewards of merit, but the mere vagaries of fortune.</Q></P>
<P>THE privacy my mother &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired was not like to be interrupted in a neighbourhood chiefly compo&s;ed of fa|milies grown wealthy by the &s;ucce&s;sful arts of trade, and had cho&s;en this retreat for their &s;ummer re&s;idence, who had no idea of any merit but riches, and allowed no
<PB N="123" REF="123">
claims to re&s;pect, but what were derived from the o&s;tentatious di&s;play of them. The name of Lumley &s;ounded le&s;s re|&s;pectable in their ears than that of Jack|&s;on or Wil&s;on, becau&s;e Jack&s;on or Wil|&s;on kept coaches, and could afford to fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day.</P>
<P>'NOTHING,' &s;ays the immortal Bacon, <Q>can make that great which nature meant to be little.</Q> Our &s;ituation af|forded us many opportunities of ob&s;erv|ing how fortune and nature were at &s;trife, when the lavi&s;h gifts be&s;towed by the one, could not efface the de&s;picable &s;tamp impre&s;&s;ed by the other. The Indian plunderer, rai&s;ed from the con|dition of a link-boy to princely affluence, in the mid&s;t of his blaze of grandeur, looked like a robber going in mock &s;tate to execution; and the fore&s;talling trader enjoyed his clum&s;y magnificence with the &s;ame a&s;pect as when he had over-reached a le&s;s cunning dealer in a bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="124">SUCH were the ob&s;ervations of Mrs. Ben&s;on, when the&s;e &s;ons and daughters of &s;udden opulence rolled in unwieldy &s;tate by our humble habitation.</P>
<P>MY mother u&s;ed &s;ometimes to chide her for the &s;everity of her &s;arca&s;ms; but her &s;pleen was often rou&s;ed by the in|conveniences which our contiguity to the&s;e great per&s;onages expo&s;ed us to: for money, which, as &s;he &s;aid, co&s;t them no|thing to acquire, but what they valued as nothing, con&s;equently, was expended &s;o lavi&s;hly, as rai&s;ed the prices of nece&s;&s;a|ries; and this grievance was &s;everely felt by their le&s;s opulent neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="125">be&s;poke every day, to furni&s;h this indi&s;|pen&s;able article to their afternoon re|gale.</P>
<P>SUCH inconveniences as the&s;e my mo|ther bore without murmuring; but &s;he was not &s;o ea&s;y under the difficulty &s;he found of procuring a &s;eat in the church, 'which,' &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, <Q>are almo&s;t all taken up with the wor&s;hippers of Mammon, to whom, as they have erected an altar in their own hou&s;es, they might as well perform their devo|tions at home, and let Chri&s;tians have acce&s;s to the hou&s;e of God.</Q></P>
<P>MY mother, however, &s;ometimes, by the force of bribe, got admi&s;&s;ion into a pew; and one Sunday, making u&s;e of the &s;ame powerful oratory, &s;he was let into a pew where there was only one lady, of a diminutive figure indeed, but a &s;oul &s;o va&s;t, as &s;eemed to oe'r-inform her &s;mall tenement of clay, and made her fancy her&s;elf large enough to occupy</P>

<P>WHEN the &s;ervice was over, the little great lady, being in a hurry to get out, flounced by my mother, and &s;aid, loud enough to be heard by her, to the wo|man who attended to open the door, <Q>I wonder at your a&s;&s;urance, to put peo|ple that nobody knows into my pew&mdash; I &s;hall complain to the church-warden, I a&s;&s;ure you.</Q></P>
<P>'MADAM,' &s;aid the woman, <Q>you have a right to but one &s;eat in the pew, and the gentlewoman looks as much like a lady as any body.</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;peech called forth a contemp|tuous &s;mile, and a repetition of the word
<PB N="127" REF="131">
'lady!' for although my mother was, as you know, my Maria, a mo&s;t elegant figure, and had an air of dignity, which was rendered more intere&s;ting by the gentle &s;orrow which &s;haded her features, yet as &s;he had no footman with her, that barrier, in this polite country town, between the high and the low, it was impo&s;&s;ible to imagine &s;he could have any claim to civility.</P>
<P>SHOCKED, but not mortified, at the ridiculous pride of this daughter of trade, my mother was preparing to go out of the pew, when &s;he was acco&s;ted by a lady, who, by her air and manner, &s;eemed to be indeed a gentlewoman; &s;he had heard what had been &s;aid to the pew|opener, and appeared much affected at it.</P>
<P>'I PERCEIVE, Madam,' &s;aid &s;he to my mother, <Q>that you are not provided with a &s;eat in this church, which in|deed is very difficult to procure in the

&s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, but you will be ex|tremely welcome to one in my pew; there is room enough, and I &s;hall be happy to accommodate you; you need only de&s;ire to be &s;hewn to Mrs. How|ard's pew, and it will always be open to you.</Q></P>
<P>THE lady curt&s;eyed, and pa&s;&s;ed on, giving my mother time to pay her ac|knowledgments for this favour, only by a deep curt&s;ey and an expre&s;&s;ive look.</P>
<P>SHE related this incident to Mrs. Ben&s;on and me when &s;he came home, telling us, at the &s;ame time, the name of the benevolent lady. <Q>I &s;hould have been &s;urpri&s;ed,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, <Q>if any of the plebeian gentry of this lofty place had been capable of &s;uch an in|&s;tance of civility to a &s;tranger; from the noble name of Howard one might expect it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="133">'IT is true,' replied my mother, <Q>that pride and meanne&s;s are generally found together; but there are per&s;ons, even of high birth, who can &s;ubmit to to be proud, and who&s;e whole great|ne&s;s lie in their titles; &s;o that if they would have us re&s;pect them, they mu&s;t &s;end a herald before to announce their claims.</Q></P>
<P>I BELIEVE you and I, my dear Maria, know &s;everal of the&s;e undignified great ones; and, to my &s;orrow, &s;ome may be found among my own relations.</P>
<P>MY mother did not fail to go to church next Sunday, and the pew|opener, who had heard what Mrs. How|ard &s;aid, immediately conducted her to that lady's pew: Mrs. Howard was al|ready there, and received her with &s;miles, that &s;hewed the &s;atisfaction &s;he felt at &s;eeing her offer &s;o readily accepted. My mother had now an opportunity of pay|ing her acknowledgments, which &s;he did

with her u&s;ual politene&s;s, and a heart glowing with gratitude.</P>
<P>MRS.

<P>MY mother being de&s;ired to tell the &s;ervant where the coach was to &s;top, directed him to the place, and &s;aid he would &s;ee the name of Lumley upon the door.</P>
<P>'Is your name Lumley, Madam?' &s;aid Mrs. Howard ha&s;tily: my mother bowing.</P>
<P><Q>THEN you are the widow of the late Mr. Lumley, who died at Bath, I pre|&s;ume?</Q> &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="135">'I AM, Madam,' replied my mother, &s;ighing.</P>
<P><Q>How happy am I to meet with you thus unexpectedly,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. How|ard; <Q>I have often wi&s;hed for the plea|&s;ure of your acquaintance; but I know not how it was, I never met you at any of my parties; but you mu&s;t promi&s;e that we &s;hall be good neigh|bours now; I generally pa&s;s three or four months every year at a little plea|&s;ant hou&s;e I have about a &s;hort mile from hence, before I go to our &s;eat in Hertford&s;hire. I will not part with you till you have promi&s;ed to &s;pend a day with me.</Q></P>
<P>MY mother a&s;&s;ured her, &s;he would with great plea&s;ure. Mrs. Howard in|&s;i&s;ted upon alighting when the coach &s;topped, that &s;he might be introduced to me, for I ha d ha&s;tened to the door to re|ceive my mother. She &s;aluted me ten|derly;</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136">&s;aid &s;ome very civil things, and took leave of us; having fir&s;t made us promi&s;e to dine with her the next day, and to name the hour when we cho&s;e the coach &s;hould come for us. But little did I imagine the influence this vi&s;it was to have over my future fortunes.</P>
<P>THE coach came for us at the ap|pointed time, and carried us to a &s;mall, but elegant building. The grounds about it were laid out with a beautiful &s;implicity, and the apartments all fur|ni&s;hed in the &s;ame ta&s;te.</P>
<P>MRS. HOWARD received us with an ea&s;y politene&s;s, which &s;oon bani&s;hed the idea of being but the acquaintance of a day. When we were &s;ummoned to the dining parlour, we found there no other company but one gentleman, who by his dre&s;s we knew to be an officer, whom Mr. Howard introduced to us as his kin&s;man.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="137">THIS was Mr. Neville, my dear Maria, now the hu&s;band of your Euphe|mia. His age &s;eemed to be about thirty; he was well bred, talked &s;en&s;ibly, and had &s;omething very gra|cious and in&s;inuating in his manner, which, I know not how it was, had not the &s;ame effect upon me that it had upon mo&s;t other per&s;ons, on whom it gene|rally produced a favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I could perceive I had at|tracted his notice, his eyes being almo&s;t con&s;tantly fixed on me, and following all my motions, yet his attentions were chiefly directed to my mother; he &s;at next her at table, and &s;erved her with every thing in the mo&s;t polite and oblig|ing manner imaginable. We walked in the gardens after dinner; he kept clo&s;e by my mother, whom he prevailed upon to lean on his arm, and entertained her with all the gallantry of an admirer, yet with all the re&s;pect and reverence of a &s;on. My mother was quite plea&s;ed with
<PB N="134" REF="138">
him; he &s;eemed &s;olicitous to gain h&egrave;r good opinion, and frequently threw out &s;entiments which did prodigious honour to his heart.</P>
<P>My mother was greatly &s;truck with one thing he &s;aid, which &s;he declared was worthy of Socrates him&s;elf. Hav|ing, upon &s;ome in&s;tance of his obliging a&s;&s;iduity, complimented him upon his politene&s;s, Mrs. Howard &s;aid, with a &s;mile, <Q>I do a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, Mr. Neville is a general favourite.</Q></P>
<P>'I PROTEST to you, Madam,' replied Mr. Neville, <Q>I do not think I have any rea&s;on to be vain of &s;uch a com|mendation; the favour of the multi|tude is &s;eldom procured by hone&s;t and lawful means. I a&s;pire indeed to the approbation of the few, for I do not number voices, but weigh them.</Q></P>
<P>'PRAY,' &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, when my mother repeated this &s;peech to her,
<PB N="135" REF="139">
'how old is this &s;ententious gentleman?' My mother replied, <Q>that &s;he believed he was under thirty.</Q> 'Ah!' replied &s;he, <Q>a philo&s;opher of that age will al|ways be &s;u&s;pected by me; the&s;e fine &s;ayings come more from the head than the heart.</Q></P>
<P><Q>YOUR &s;atire is too keen, my dear Ben&s;on,</Q> &s;aid my mother, <Q>it is ea&s;y to perceive you are out of humour with the world; but having no rea&s;on to be &s;o on your own account, I mu&s;t place it to your friend&s;hip for me, who am &s;o unea&s;ily &s;ituated in it; however, Fortune may ju&s;tify her&s;elf for having favoured me &s;o little, for I am &s;ure I never courted her.</Q></P>
<P>'BUT I would fain know,' &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, <Q>what my young pupil here thinks of this grave young gentle|man?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="140">'MY mama thinks well of him,' &s;aid I, <Q>her judgment ought to be a guide to mine; but if I may be permitted to &s;peak my &s;entiments, I think the air of his countenance and the graciou&s;ne&s;s of his manner, are not of a piece; his &s;miles are rather forbidding than con|ciliating, and do not &s;eem calculated to invite confidence in the goodne&s;s of his temper.</Q></P>
<P>'UPON my word,' &s;aid my mother, half &s;miling, <Q>Mrs. Ben&s;on &s;eems to have infu&s;ed part of her &s;pirit in you; but my dear,</Q> pur&s;ued &s;he in a grave tone, <Q>I wi&s;h he were your hu&s;band; I am per&s;uaded he would make you happy; and to &s;ee you &s;ettled, is all the wi&s;h I have on this &s;ide heaven.</Q></P>
<P>'DEAR Madam,' &s;aid I, a little di&s;|concerted, <Q>the gentleman has no thought of me.</Q> 'I do not know that,' replied my mother, <Q>I am &s;ure he took a very particular notice of you; and as
<PB N="137" REF="141">
he &s;eems to be a man of much worth and honour, it would make me happy to leave you under &s;uch a protection.</Q></P>
<P>THIS la&s;t thought affected me with a tender concern; and made Mrs. Ben&s;on look grave. We changed the di&s;cour&s;e; but my mother often mentioned Mr. Neville, &s;till finding &s;omething in his manners and behaviour to ground a good opinion of his morals on.</P>
<P>HE called the next day to enquire after our health, but only left his name, with|out &s;taying to be a&s;ked in, which af|forded my mother new matter for prai&s;e, as his mode&s;ty &s;eemed in this in&s;tance to be equal to his politene&s;s.</P>
<P>IT &s;oon became a cu&s;tom to dine every Sunday with Mrs. Howard, who carried us home with her from church, and we were always &s;ure to find Mr. Ne|ville there. His behaviour to me was now particular enough to be ob&s;erved by
<PB N="138" REF="142">
every body. Mrs. Howard, railing me on my conque&s;t, was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>there are few men worthy of you, but, in point of birth or fortune, Mr. Ne|ville is no improper match. On the death of his uncle, who is now &s;eventy, he will &s;ucceed to an e&s;tate of eight hun|dred a year; he is likely to ri&s;e in the army, and his own fortune, which is about five thou&s;and pounds, is, I be|lieve, &s;till entire, as I never heard he was addicted to any extravagance.</Q></P>
<P>MY mother was very well plea&s;ed with this account of his circum&s;tances. <Q>Such an e&s;tabli&s;hment for my daugh|ter,</Q> &s;aid &s;he to Mrs. Ben&s;on, <Q>is in her &s;ituation not to be rejected, e&s;pe|cially when the man is &s;o worthy.</Q></P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on, who knew how little I was di&s;po&s;ed to become a wife, and did not perhaps think &s;o highly of Mr. Ne|ville's good qualities as my mother did, &s;hewed no great &s;atisfaction at Mr. Ne|ville's
<PB N="139" REF="143">
addre&s;&s;es, and wi&s;hed the affair not to be hurried on too fa&s;t.</P>
<P>'IT is dangerous,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>to en|ter the &s;tate of marriage ra&s;hly, and by the conduct of fortune; all the eyes that prudence hath, are not too many to &s;erve as a guide in this bu&s;ine&s;s; for errors are mortal, where repentance is unprofitable.</Q></P>
<P>SHE &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e to me at my mother's earne&s;tne&s;s to con|clude this affair. Alas! the motive &s;oon became too obvious; her health was declining fa&s;t, her anxiety for me preyed upon her &s;pirits; I could often ob&s;erve her look at me earne&s;tly for a minute till her eyes filled with tears, and then &s;he would ha&s;tily turn away to con|ceal her emotion.</P>
<P>MR. NEVILLE'S behaviour, all this time, was &s;o tender, &s;o obliging, &s;o eager to do us little &s;ervices, &s;o attentive to my
<PB N="140" REF="144">
mother, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, yet &s;o re&s;pectful to me, that he even brought over Mrs. Ben|&s;on, in &s;ome degree, to his party. She would &s;ometimes tell me, that &s;ince I was ab&s;olutely certain his addre&s;&s;es to me were not actuated by any motives of in|tere&s;t, I owed him &s;ome gratitude for the &s;incerity of his affection.</P>
<P>MY mother's illne&s;s now increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t upon her, as to fill us with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions; the phy&s;icians acknowledged they thought her ca&s;e dan|gerous. I pa&s;&s;ed my days, and the greate&s;t part of my nights, by her bed|&s;ide, indulging my tears in her inter|vals of re&s;t&mdash;for I carefully concealed from her the agonizing fears that filled my mind.</P>
<P>MR. NEVILLE, on this occa&s;ion, &s;hewed all the tenderne&s;s of a &s;on, and all the &s;ympathy of the mo&s;t cordial friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="145">'OH! that you could love this man,' &s;aid my mother to me one day, <Q>what &s;atisfaction would it give me to leave you under his protection; for indeed, my dear child,</Q> pur&s;ued &s;he, <Q>I have rea&s;on to think my anxiety for you is one of the chief &s;ources of my illne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>I STARTED from the chair where I was &s;itting, I threw my&s;elf on my knees at her bed-&s;ide, and bathing the dear hand &s;he held out to me with my tears, 'My dear mama,' &s;aid I, <Q>why, oh! why did you not explain your&s;elf be|fore? could you doubt my ready obe|dience to your will?</Q></P>
<P>'IN this ca&s;e, my Euphemia,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I would exact nothing from your obedience; my wi&s;h went no far|ther than that you could love Mr. Ne|ville. Your good opinion of him I am &s;ure he has.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="146">'HE has, Madam,' &s;aid I, <Q>and I will teach my heart to love him, &s;ince he is your choice, and &s;ince the peace of your mind depends upon my being &s;ettled; &s;hould my compliance re&s;tore you to your health, I &s;hall be the hap|pie&s;t of human beings.</Q></P>
<P>'AND to &s;ee you happy,' &s;aid my mother, <Q>is all my wi&s;h upon earth; I am per&s;uaded Mr. Neville will make you &s;o, provided you have no di&s;like to him.</Q></P>
<P>'How is it po&s;&s;ible, Madam,' &s;aid I, <Q>that I can have any di&s;like to a per|&s;on for whom you have &s;o great a re|gard? Doubt not but I &s;hall love Mr. Neville, when it is my duty &s;o to do; and I will make it my duty when|ever you plea&s;e to command me.</Q></P>
<P>'MY dear child,' &s;aid my mother, <Q>Heaven will, I doubt not, reward you for this, as well as every other in&s;tance
<PB N="143" REF="147">
of your filial piety. From a young woman of your re&s;erved and delicate turn of mind, I expected no &s;udden attachment, no romantic flights of pa&s;&s;ion; but I am well a&s;&s;ured, that the man whom your judgment ap|proves, will, when entitled to your af|fection, po&s;&s;e&s;s it entirely.</Q></P>
<P>FROM that day my mother began to be not only compo&s;ed, but cheerful; the ea&s;y &s;tate of her mind had &s;uch a powerful effect upon her health, that in a few days &s;he left her bed, and her re|covery &s;eemed no longer doubtful.</P>
<P>MR. NEVILLE received my con&s;ent with tran&s;ports that &s;eemed to border, I thought, upon madne&s;s, and rather frighted than plea&s;ed me. He a&s;ked his uncle's con&s;ent for form's &s;ake, which was neither granted nor refu&s;ed; for the old gentleman, who was not &s;atisfied with his conduct in general, had long cea&s;ed to trouble him&s;elf about his af|fairs;
<PB N="144" REF="148">
and it was thought, that his di&s;|gu&s;t had ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, that if he could have di&s;inherited him, he would certainly have done it.</P>
<P>MR. NEVILLE'S &s;ecurity on this point was perhaps one cau&s;e of the little care he took to conciliate him.</P>
<P>MY mother made no reflections to the di&s;advantage of Mr. Neville on account of this coolne&s;s between him and his re|lation; for there are times when &s;ome per&s;ons are always in the right. We were married; and my hu&s;band, in about a fortnight afterwards, carried me to a genteel hou&s;e in Hill-&s;treet, which he had taken ready furni&s;hed for my re|ception.</P>
<P>THE parting with my mother, who&s;e &s;tate of health did not permit her to live in London, would have been very grie|vous to me, if I had not been enabled to vi&s;it her con&s;tantly every day; for,
<PB N="145" REF="149">
among other articles of expence which I did not expect, from the very mode|rate income my hu&s;band po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent, I had a chariot and &s;ervants in elegant liveries. My mother gently hinted her fears, that his great fondne&s;s for me would, in the oeconomy of his hou&s;e and appearance, make him con&s;i|der rather the affluence in which I had been bred, than the humble condition to which fortune had reduced me.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard it ob&s;erved, that it is common for per&s;ons who are con&s;cious that they have done things de&s;erving of blame, to an&s;wer their own thoughts, rather than what is &s;aid to them. Mr. Neville, therefore, ha&s;tily replied, <Q>I have no intention to mi&s;lead my Eu|phemia into an opinion that I am richer than I really am. I never deceived her with regard to my pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces, nor my future pro&s;pects; what you object to was not done to ca&s;t a mi&s;t before her eyes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="150">'MY dear &s;on,' &s;aid my mother, ha&s;tily interrupting him, <Q>how va&s;tly do you mi&s;take my meaning. You are incapable of deceit; but you are al&s;o incapable of reflecting, that your wife having brought you no fortune, has no claim to any increa&s;e of expence be|yond conveniences.</Q></P>
<P>MY hu&s;band's countenance now cleared up, and this &s;hort debate ended with a kind compliment to me, which I was plea&s;ed with, becau&s;e it gave her &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>MR. NEVILLE, however, had deceived &s;everal of his friends, and Mrs. Howard in particular, with regard to his circum|&s;tances, and con&s;equently my mother; for of his own fortune, which was five thou&s;and pounds, the greate&s;t part was &s;pent. He had commanded a company of foot in a regiment which was lately reduced, and his half-pay was almo&s;t all he had to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on. Without reflect|ing
<PB N="147" REF="151">
upon the cau&s;es of di&s;gu&s;t he had given his uncle, he hoped that upon his marriage, an event which he had often wi&s;hed for, he would have made him a decent allowance out of an e&s;tate which mu&s;t one day be his, and of which he did not &s;pend the half upon him&s;elf; but in this he was di&s;appointed; after many fruitle&s;s endeavours to &s;often his uncle, he took a &s;udden re&s;olution (for his re|&s;olutions are always &s;udden) to extricate him&s;elf from his difficulties by going abroad; and fortune, on this occa&s;ion, favoured his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>A YOUNG gentleman, who was ap|pointed fir&s;t Lieutenant to one of the in|dependent companies in New-York, having no inclination to leave England, entered eagerly into a propo&s;al Mr. Ne|ville made him, to exchange this com|mi&s;&s;ion for his Captain's half-pay; and having very con&s;iderable intere&s;t, the affair was &s;oon accompli&s;hed. Mr. Ne|ville,
<PB N="148" REF="152">
who has very high notions of the prerogatives of a hu&s;band, and doubt|le&s;s &s;ore&s;eeing the oppo&s;ition I &s;hould make to this &s;cheme, never deigned to con&s;ult me upon it. Little did I expect the &s;torm that was ready to bur&s;t upon my head; when one evening, having &s;taid later than u&s;ual with my mother, on my return I found him at home, very bu&s;y at his e&s;crutore looking over papers, and &s;ettling accounts.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome enquiries concerning my mother's health, he a&s;ked me abruptly, 'if I &s;hould like to travel?' I &s;aid, <Q>I &s;hould like it extremely in certain cir|cum&s;tances.</Q> <Q>And pray what are the&s;e certain circum&s;tances, my dear?</Q> &s;aid he. 'Why,' replied I, <Q>a full pur&s;e, and my mother's company.</Q> <Q>I cannot promi&s;e for either,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>and yet I believe we mu&s;t travel.</Q> He &s;aid this with &s;o grave a look and accent, that although I could hardly think him
<PB N="149" REF="153">
in earne&s;t, yet I was &s;trangely alarmed; and I a&s;ked him, with &s;ome emotion, 'what he meant?'</P>
<P>'I MEAN what I &s;ay,' replied he, <Q>that we mu&s;t go abroad, my dear; it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P>'ABSOLUTELY nece&s;&s;ary to go abroad!' I repeated, trembling, and &s;carce able to &s;peak.</P>
<P>'IT is really as I tell you,' &s;aid he, without taking notice of the di&s;order I was in. <Q>My uncle is incorrigible, he will make no addition to my income, which is too &s;mall to &s;upport you pro|perly. I am be&s;ides incumbered with &s;ome debts, which, without his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, I am not able to pay; and he has had the cruelty to refu&s;e me a few hun|dreds, which would have &s;et me at ea&s;e. Fortunately an opportunity of|fers, which will enable me to extricate my&s;elf from the&s;e difficulties without
<PB N="150" REF="154">
his help. I have made an advantage|ous exchange with an officer who was going to New-York. It is one of the fine&s;t of our American provinces; the climate is delightful, the air healthy, the people poli&s;hed; all the luxuries of life are there more ea&s;ily purcha&s;ed than common nece&s;&s;aries here. There will be no great hard&s;hip in pa&s;&s;ing three or four years there. My un|cle's death will be the period of our bani&s;hment, if you will have me call it &s;o: his age and infirmities &s;carce make it probable that he can la&s;t long; we will then return to Eng|land.</Q></P>
<P>ALL the time he was &s;peaking, I &s;at with my hands folded, and my eyes fixed on the ground, in an agony of thought. He pau&s;ed, as if expecting me to an&s;wer him.</P>
<P>'You &s;ay nothing to me, Euphemia,' &s;aid he at length. <Q>You think it a
<PB N="151" REF="155">
hard&s;hip, no doubt, to follow a hu&s;|band who has given you &s;uch uncom|mon proofs of his affection.</Q></P>
<P>'OH! my dear mother,' cried I, <Q>am I to be torn from you, at a time when my attendance on you is &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary?</Q></P>
<P>'YOUR mother will go with us, per|haps,' &s;aid he. <Q>The voyage is not &s;o long a one as you imagine; they often run it in le&s;s than three weeks.</Q></P>
<P>'I CHARGE you,' interrupted I, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, and holding him as if he was go|ing that in&s;tant to my mother, <Q>I charge you, do not carry this dreadful news to my mother; you will kill her; &s;he will not &s;urvive the parting with me. Alas! was it for this</Q>&mdash;I pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>'Go on,' &s;aid Mr. Neville, <Q>was it for this you married? I know to whom I was obliged for your reluctant con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="156">THIS was a &s;ad thought.&mdash;Agitated as I was with other grie&s;s, I perceived in&s;tantly all the inconveniencies this notion, if it took too deep root, would bring upon me: but it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to eradicate it, without de&s;cend|ing to the meanne&s;s of fal&s;ehood; my &s;oul was unacquainted with tho&s;e emo|tions, which, on this occa&s;ion, would have &s;ugge&s;ted profe&s;&s;ions of fondne&s;s and attachment, &s;uch as he perhaps ex|pected. I an&s;wered, therefore, with great &s;implicity, <Q>It is true, Sir, you were my mother's choice; I never had any other will but her's, and her choice regulated mine; but I would not have married an emperor, if by that marriage I &s;hould have been obliged to leave her.</Q></P>
<P>'WELL,' an&s;wered he, carele&s;sly, <Q>I believe your mother will be the only rival I &s;hall ever have in your affec|tions: we mu&s;t endeavour to prevail upon her to go with us. But pray,</Q>
<PB N="153" REF="157">
pur&s;ued he, in a kinder accent, <Q>com|po&s;e your&s;elf; this &s;eparation is yet too di&s;tant to occa&s;ion all this unea&s;i|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>'BUT &s;till it is certain,' &s;aid I; <Q>is it not &s;o?</Q></P>
<P>'I AM afraid it is,' he replied. <Q>My affairs are in &s;uch perplexity, that it mu&s;t be &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>AT this deci&s;ive word my tears flowed afre&s;h. His patience (for, alas! he has but a &s;mall &s;hare of that u&s;eful qua|lity) &s;eemed now exhau&s;ted; he ro&s;e up, and taking his hat, told me, he was obliged to go out, and hoped when he returned to find me in a better humour.</P>
<P>I WAS not &s;orry to be left alone, that I might give free vent to my tears. But &s;carce had I pa&s;&s;ed a few minutes in this &s;ad employment, when my &s;ervant in|formed me a gentleman from Lord S.
<PB N="154" REF="158">
de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. This noble|man, my dear Maria, was a relation of my mother's, and was my god-father, as I believe you have heard me &s;ay. He was but very lately returned from the Continent, where he had &s;pent two years in &s;earch of health, which, how|ever, he had not found; as his let|ter, which his gentleman now deli|vered to me, informed me. He ex|pre&s;&s;ed great concern for my father's death, and the &s;ituation in which he had left my mother and me; wi&s;hed me happy in my marriage, and de|&s;ired my acceptance of five hundred pounds as a nuptial pre&s;ent, lamenting his inability to do more for me; which indeed I knew to be true, as he had but a &s;mall e&s;tate, and &s;everal children to provide for.</P>
<P>My &s;urpri&s;e at this unexpected piece of good fortune, at a time when I was overwhelmed with de&s;pair, was &s;o great, that the letter fell out of my hands, and
<PB N="155" REF="159">
the bank-notes enclo&s;ed in it were &s;cat|tered about the room. My &s;oul was filled with joy and gratitude; in this pro|vidential relief I felt, I acknowledged the gracious hand of Heaven! It was with difficulty I could compo&s;e my&s;elf to write a few lines to my kind benefac|tor; and, when I &s;ent for his me&s;&s;enger to deliver my billet to him my&s;elf, the tran&s;port I was in might ea&s;ily be read in my countenance. Delivered from my fears of being &s;eparated from my mother, by being thus enabled to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of my hu&s;band, I felt as if a mountain was removed from my brea&s;t. I expected his return with in|conceivable impatience; and as &s;oon as he entered the room I flew eagerly to him.</P>
<P>'My dear Mr. Neville,' &s;aid I, deli|vering him the letter with the notes, <Q>&s;ee how Providence has interpo&s;ed to prevent a &s;eparation, that would have given death to my mother, and made

me mi&s;erable. The&s;e &s;ums will, I hope, be &s;ufficient to &s;et you at ea&s;e, and make it unnece&s;&s;ary for you to go abroad.</Q></P>
<P>HE read the letter, and examined the notes. &mdash;'It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed,' &s;aid he coldly, <Q>this is a fortunate circum&s;tance, con&s;idering your great unwillingne&s;s to leave England. &mdash;Well, Euphemia, I hope you will now be ea&s;y, &s;ince you have your wi&s;h</Q>. I &s;aw he ex|pected I &s;hould thank him for his ready acquie&s;cence to my will; and by this piece of policy he e&s;caped what to him would have been a very great morti|fication&mdash;the appearance of being under any obligation to me or my friends. My an&s;wer was calculated to plea&s;e him, and I left him the next day in very good humour, in order to vi&s;it my mother.</P>
<P>My heart was light, and the inward &s;atisfaction I felt gave &s;uch an air of
<PB N="157" REF="161">
cheerfulne&s;s to my countenance, that upon my entering my mother's apart|ment &s;he took notice of it. Holding out her hand to me, which I ki&s;&s;ed, <Q>May I always &s;ee you,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>with this contented air; and may you never have rea&s;on to be otherwi&s;e!</Q></P>
<P>ALAS! how &s;oon was my cheerfulne&s;s to be overca&s;t; I felt her hand inten&s;ely hot. I fixed my eager looks upon her face; the alteration I perceived there froze me with terror. <Q>I have had but an indifferent night, but I am better now</Q>, &s;aid &s;he, forcing a &s;mile to di&s;|&s;ipate my apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on that moment entered the room: in the fixed concern that was vi&s;ible in her face I read my impending misfortune. She was followed by the phy&s;ician; but from him I could col|lect no comfort: he even acknowledged to me that my mother was in great danger. Shall I attempt to de&s;cribe my
<PB N="158" REF="162">
feelings to you on this occa&s;ion? Oh! no, it is impo&s;&s;ible to give you an idea of my di&s;tre&s;s. I had &s;ent back the carriage to town, which returned again immediately with Mr. Neville, who had been informed, by a billet from Mrs. Ben&s;on, of my mother's &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t dutiful, the mo&s;t affection|ate of &s;ons, could not have behaved otherwi&s;e than he did: and I have the comfort to reflect, that my mother, to the la&s;t moment of her life, was fully per&s;uaded that I was perfectly happy in the choice &s;he had made for me.</P>
<P>I LEFT her no more after this day, nor ever parted from her bed-&s;ide a moment while &s;he lived. I had command enough over my&s;elf to &s;uppre&s;s my &s;ighs and tears, that I might not inter|rupt that &s;aint-like compo&s;ure with which &s;he waited for her di&s;&s;olution. All the moments that were not &s;pent in her devotions, &s;he employed in con&s;ol|ing,
<PB N="159" REF="163">
fortifying, and in&s;tructing me. With the mo&s;t pathetic &s;weetne&s;s &s;he recommended me to my hu&s;band's care. She intreated Mrs. Ben&s;on to continue her friend&s;hip for me; and heard, with great &s;atisfaction, her promi&s;e never to for&s;ake me. She talked &s;en&s;ibly, &s;he rea&s;oned ju&s;tly, to the la&s;t moment of her life. It was not more than a quar|ter of an hour before &s;he died, when, faintly pre&s;&s;ing my hand, which &s;he held in her's, and looking earne&s;tly on me,&mdash; 'It has been &s;aid,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>with more wit than truth, that virtue was the mo&s;t beautiful and the mo&s;t unprofitable thing in the world. Can that be called unprofitable which, when &s;upported by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, give a calm like this?</Q> My heart, &s;unk as it was with &s;orrow, caught the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of her words.</P>
<P>'OH!' cried I, lifting up my &s;wim|ming eyes to Heaven, <Q>may I die the death of the righteous, and may my
<PB N="160" REF="164">
latter end be like their's!</Q> &mdash;A &s;mile of joy beamed over her countenance, now beginning to be over&s;pread with the dark &s;hades of death&mdash;once more I felt the faint pre&s;&s;ure of her hand, now cold and clammy, and withdrawing from mine. &mdash; To the la&s;t moment &s;he kept her eyes fixed upon me&mdash;then, gently clo&s;ing them, her head &s;unk upon my bo&s;om, and with one &s;oft &s;igh &s;he breathed out her pure and innocent &s;oul.</P>
<P>HERE let me draw a veil over the &s;ad &s;cene that en&s;ued. &mdash;My hu&s;band car|ried me in his arms, and put me into the chariot, where I continued without &s;en&s;e or motion till we arrived at our own hou&s;e. I had no rea&s;on to com|plain of his behaviour to me on this occa&s;ion; it was tender, affectionate, and a&s;&s;iduous, and filled my heart with the warme&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on came in the evening, and &s;pent two hours with me; and then
<PB N="161" REF="165">
returned to watch by the dear remains of her friend and benefactre&s;s. Lord S. de&s;ired to be at the expence of the fune|ral, which was performed in a manner &s;uitable to her birth and happier for|tunes. &mdash;She lies in the family vault at &mdash;. Oh, my Maria, I mu&s;t pau&s;e here for a while; when I can de|tach my thoughts from this affecting &s;ubject, I will continue my narration.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was recovered from a dangerous fever, with which I was &s;eized immediately after the death of my mother, Lord S. in&s;i&s;ted upon my pa&s;&s;ing a few weeks at his country-&s;eat with his lady and daughters. Mr. Ne|ville was al&s;o invited; but he pleaded bu&s;ine&s;s in town that required his at|tendance, and contented him&s;elf with &s;ometimes coming to pa&s;s a day or two with us.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="166">WHEN I returned to town, I found Mrs. Ben&s;on had, with the concurrence of my hu&s;band, &s;ettled all my mother's affairs. She had taken lodgings in the &s;ame &s;treet where I lived, that &s;he might be near me: and, now my mind being a little more compo&s;ed, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;ent to Mr. Neville, that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our circum|&s;tances, prudence required we &s;hould adopt &s;ome plan of living le&s;s expen|&s;ive, and more &s;uitable to our income. I took care to avoid giving this di&s;|cour&s;e the air of advice; I even com|plimented his tenderne&s;s, by a&s;cribing to that motive the figure we had hitherto made, which I &s;aid I was by no means intitled to.</P>
<P>Mr. Neville, as u&s;ual, an&s;wered his own thoughts&mdash; 'I &s;uppo&s;e,' &s;ays he, <Q>you think it &s;trange that I have not yet acquainted you with the manner in which I have di&s;po&s;ed of your five

hundred pounds; but the time has not been favourable for &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>'ALAS! no,' &s;aid I, bur&s;ting into tears at the &s;ad remembrance he excited by the&s;e la&s;t words. &mdash;'And perhaps,' pur&s;ued he, <Q>I have now introduced this &s;ubject un&s;ea&s;onably; if you plea&s;e we will talk no more of it at pre&s;ent,</Q></P>
<P>IT was not long, however, before he renewed it him&s;elf. &mdash;<Q>I cannot &s;ubmit to alter my mode of living,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>and I cannot continue it without in|volving my&s;elf in difficulties&mdash;there is no help for it&mdash;we mu&s;t go abroad. &mdash; If your mother had lived, I &s;hould. have found it very difficult to have mentioned this to you again; but as it is, I think you can have no objection to changing the &s;cene for a few years.</Q></P>
<P>MY &s;urpri&s;e and confu&s;ion were &s;o great at this unexpected declaration, that I continued &s;ilent for &s;ome mo|ments;
<PB N="164" REF="168">
during which his countenance was marked with &s;o much impatience, that I thought proper to tell him, I would endeavour to overcome the re|luctance I had to quit my native coun|try, and tho&s;e few friends which the wreck of my fortunes had left me; but he mu&s;t permit me to &s;ay, <Q>that I wi&s;h this hard ta&s;k had not been impo&s;ed upon me</Q>.&mdash;<Q>He &s;aid, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to break through his engagement, without bringing &s;uch a &s;tain upon his honour, as could never be wiped off.</Q>&mdash;'Since that is the ca&s;e,' I replied, 'I have nothing more to &s;ay;' and from that moment I have never &s;uf|fered him to perceive that I had any reluctance to this voyage.</P>
<P>MY dear Mrs. Ben&s;on goes with me. She has nothing dearer, &s;he &s;ays, than me in the world; and no claims upon her that &s;hould hinder her from keeping the promi&s;e &s;he made to my mother never to for&s;ake me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT an affecting narrative is your's? If Nature her&s;elf could &s;peak, &s;he could not make u&s;e of more &s;ignificant terms. You are above all prai&s;e; therefore, without incurring the guilt of making you vain, I may ven|ture to tell you how we talk of you here in our &s;et. 'She is a woman,' &s;aid Mr. Grevilie, <Q>either lifted up by her own &s;trength above the pa&s;&s;ions of her &s;ex, or Nature hath exempted her from them by a peculiar privilege.</Q>&mdash;'Mi&s;s Lumley,' &s;aid my uncle, <Q>is indeed a wonderful young woman; &s;he had an excellent monitre&s;s in her mother; and &s;he has profited well, both by her

le&s;&s;ons and example. Young as &s;he is, &s;he is &s;trict in the performance of all her duties, yet &s;he affects no pecu|liar gravity in her a&s;pect and manners, but tempers her re&s;erve with &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s, that, without endeavouring to plea&s;e any, &s;he plea&s;es all the world.</Q></P>
<P>HAD any per&s;ons been pre&s;ent at this di&s;cour&s;e, who were ignorant of my &s;en|timents for you, they might have judged, from my &s;ilence and di&s;contented air, that I was envious of your prai&s;es. This is the friend, thought I, I mu&s;t lo&s;e; and &s;he, of whom hardly any man can be worthy, mu&s;t follow one, who a&s;|&s;uredly cannot be ranked among the be&s;t, to the wilds of America.</P>
<P>I AM afraid you will be angry with me, my Euphemia, for the&s;e impa|tient repinings, and for profiting &s;o little by the example you &s;et me; but you well know, that there are &s;ome of us of &s;uch &s;pirits, that neither time nor

philo&s;ophy can work upon us; while there are others again, who prevent the work of time and philo&s;ophy by their own natural di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>WE are going to &s;pend a week at Mr. Greville's: he &s;ets out to-day, to prepare for our reception, and two days afterwards we are to follow him. My chief plea&s;ure there, as well as here, will be writing to you. I hope to have a letter from you before we leave the Hall. Adieu, my dear friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>YESTERDAY Mr. Neville told me he had been to pay his re&s;pects to Colonel Bellenden, who&s;e fir&s;t lieutenant he now is, and who is appointed com|mander of the forces &s;tationed at New York under the governor, who, it &s;eems, is captain-general. The colonel introduced him to his lady and daughters: he was greatly plea&s;ed with his recep|tion; and, having de&s;ired leave to pre|&s;ent me to Mrs. Bellenden, and the young ladies, we received a polite invi|tation to dine there to-day, which we accepted.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="174">Mr. Neville is much out of humour that, being &s;till in mourning for my dear mother, I cannot appear with eclat; that is his expre&s;&s;ion in this my fir&s;t vi&s;it. He takes upon him to judge what ornaments I may wear with pro|priety, and has actually laid out my jewels, which, he &s;ays, will receive additional lu&s;tre from my &s;able habit.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that ob&s;tinate per&s;ons are ever mo&s;t ob&s;tinate in error. Unhappily I experience the truth of this ob&s;ervation every day, on &s;ome occa&s;ion or other. When Mr. Neville has once given his opinion, however erroneous it may be, it is impo&s;&s;ible by argument to &s;et him right, for rea&s;on it&s;elf would &s;eem to be wrong if it is not of his &s;ide. I was &s;adly perplexed; for I &s;aw no|thing but determined oppo&s;ition would &s;ave me from an ab&s;urdity, and upon this I could not re&s;olve; when, fortu|nately for me, he took it into his head to make an appeal to Mrs. Ben&s;on, who
<PB N="171" REF="175">
&s;at &s;miling all the time, without med|dling in the di&s;pute. But fir&s;t, he en|deavoured, by a long &s;peech, to convince her, that what he propo&s;ed was the fit|te&s;t thing in the world to be done.</P>
<P>'I KNOW not who it is,' &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, very gravely, <Q>who &s;ays that eloquence is that powerful, efficacious, and dangerous gift, alike capable of per&s;uading both to what is right and what is wrong. There is no an&s;wering your arguments, that is certain; but you are too gallant not to yield up this point to Mrs. Neville, &s;ince the article of dre&s;s is entirely her own affair.</Q>&mdash;'Oh, to be &s;ure,' &s;aid Mr. Neville, <Q>&s;he is at liberty to dre&s;s as &s;he plea&s;es; I only wanted to convince her I was right in what I propo&s;ed; &mdash;but I am &s;atisfied if you think me &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>HE was indeed &s;atisfied with the com|pliment Mrs. Ben&s;on paid to his elo|quence, yet he could not help, now and
<PB N="172" REF="176">
then, returning to the charge, with&mdash; <Q>How plainly you are dre&s;&s;ed, my dear; if you would but add a few ornaments you would look much better.</Q>&mdash;I con|&s;tantly replied with a &s;mile, <Q>Have you not &s;aid I &s;hould dre&s;s as I plea&s;e?</Q>&mdash;'Oh, to be &s;ure, to be &s;ure,' he cried, 'I &s;hall never contradict you;'&mdash;and the next moment, <Q>Certainly, my dear, you might wear diamond ear-rings, at lea&s;t.</Q>&mdash;But I &s;ee the chariot at the door&mdash;my hu&s;band is coming to fetch me. I prote&s;t he &s;urveys me with a look of di&s;approbation; I mu&s;t remind him of the compliment Mrs. Ben&s;on paid him to put him in a good humour again. Farewel, my dear Maria, I will give you an account of our new ac|quaintance when we return, if we are not kept too late.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="173" REF="177">
<HEAD>TEN O'CLOCK.</HEAD>
<P>WE are ju&s;t come home.&mdash;Mr. Neville is engaged with a gentleman in the parlour, who having bu&s;ine&s;s with him, waited his return; &s;o I have an hour before &s;upper, which I &s;hall devote to you, my dear Maria, to acquit my&s;elf of my promi&s;e.</P>
<P>WE were &s;et down at a hand&s;ome hou&s;e in St. James's Square, and &s;hewn into a genteel drawing-room; into which, immediately afterwards, came Mrs. Bellenden, followed by three young ladies, her daughters. Mrs. Bellenden is about-five-and forty years of age, or &s;omething more. She has, in her youth, been hand&s;ome, though her complexion is brown, for her features are regular and plea&s;ing, and her eyes remarkably fine. She is well made; her motions perfectly genteel; and, in her beha|viour,
<PB N="174" REF="178">
&s;he has all that ea&s;y politene&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hes per&s;ons in a certain rank of life. After &s;aluting me with a mixture of ceremony and cordiality, both as a &s;tranger, and one with whom an intimate connection was likely &s;oon to take place, &s;he pre&s;ented her three daughters to me by name.</P>
<P>MISS Bellenden, the elde&s;t, is about two-and-twenty, tall, and well-&s;haped, and may doubtle&s;s be called a good figure: yet her proportions are not fine, and her motions want grace. She is reckoned extremely hand&s;ome, Mr. Neville &s;ays; and it is certain that &s;he has a fine complexion, and very regu|lar features; but they are merely regular, cold and in&s;ipid. Her eyes are not animated with any thing but motion, and &s;o totally devoid of expre&s;&s;ion, that they may more properly be &s;aid to &s;ee than to look. She made me a &s;hort compliment, which gave me an oppor|tunity of ob&s;erving, that the tones of her
<PB N="175" REF="179">
voice are unplea&s;ing, and her expre&s;|&s;ion confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>LOUISA, the &s;econd daughter, re&s;em|bles her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter in the delicacy of her complexion, and the air of her features; but has greatly the advantage of her in the elegance of her form, which has be|&s;ides more dignity in it than I ever remember to have &s;een in one &s;o young. This young lady is about fifteen; &s;he &s;eems grave and re&s;erved; and returned my &s;alute with a deep curt&s;ey, with|out &s;carce rai&s;ing her eyes.</P>
<P>CLARA, the younge&s;t daughter, is about fourteen, all life, &s;oul and &s;en&s;ibility. She appeared, in her impatience to &s;a|lute me, almo&s;t ready to prevent her mother, who introduced her in her turn. The &s;ame powerful &s;ympathy drew me towards her; I could &s;carcely help embracing her tenderly; but I checked this involuntary emotion, and confined my&s;elf to form. How &s;hall I
<PB N="176" REF="180">
give you an idea of this amiable girl, who&s;e loveline&s;s is rather felt than &s;een, how paint the ever-varying charms of a countenance which is never the &s;ame for three minutes together, yet plea&s;ing in every change. She is not thought &s;o hand&s;ome as either of her &s;i&s;ters, her complexion being le&s;s fair, and her fea|tures not &s;o delicate. Her eyes, how|ever, are the fine&s;t in the world; large, dark, full of fire, full of &s;oftne&s;s: lan|gui&s;hing, yet bright; lively yet tender: &s;o full of expre&s;&s;ion, that it is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her to &s;peak, the intelli|gence of her looks conveying her thoughts as di&s;tinctly as her words. The make of her face is genteel, and her &s;mile bewitching. She does not pro|mi&s;e to be quite &s;o tall as her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, nor to equal her &s;econd in the dignity of her per&s;on; but &s;he excels them both in the elegance and &s;ymme|try of her form. Her voice, in &s;peak|ing, is &s;o &s;weet, &s;o modulated, that it is a kind of oratory in it&s;elf, and per|&s;uades
<PB N="177" REF="181">
as much as her words. She continued to &s;it near me the whole day, which gave me great plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IN about half an hour after our ar|rival. Colonel Bellenden entered the room. With an air of ea&s;y dignity he apoligized to us for not being able to join us &s;ooner, having been detained at the coffee hou&s;e by &s;ome per&s;ons of bu|&s;ine&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;ible, my dear Ma|ria, to look upon this gentleman with|out feeling for him, even at fir&s;t &s;ight, love, e&s;teem, and reverence. He has a fine figure, a noble air, a mo&s;t engaging countenance, in which every virtue that adorns the human heart is apparent. He is not a man of letters, having, as he told us, been a &s;oldier from the age of fourteen; but nature has given him an excellent under&s;tanding. He talks little, but that little is always to the purpo&s;e; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o much na|tural grace, that all he &s;ays and does is plea&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="182">SUCH, my Maria, is the family with whom I am to make a voyage to the New World; and, I believe, you will not think I &s;hall find it a difficult mat|ter to pa&s;s my time agreeably with them.</P>
<P>WHEN tea was announced, we re|turned to the drawing-room, leaving the two gentlemen to their wine. Mi&s;s Bellenden then drawing her chair near me, &s;aid in a low voice, and a half &s;igh&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Do you know, Madam, when this terrible voyage is to take place?</Q>&mdash;'Not exactly, Madam,' I replied; <Q>but I am &s;orry to find you are &s;o much afraid of the &s;ea.</Q></P>

<P><Q>YOUR &s;i&s;ter may have heard &s;o from me,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Bellenden, 'who &s;eemed anxious to quiet her daughter's mind about the&s;e matters. <Q>I have been told, by per&s;ons who have re&s;ided &s;ome years in the province of New-York, that it is a very gay place, that the people are fond of polite amu&s;e|ments, and are in general very well bred.</Q> That la&s;t article, I found, had great weight with Mrs. Beilenden, for &s;he &s;poke it with an empha&s;is.</P>
<P>'I AM informed too,' proceeded Mrs. Bellenden, <Q>that the air is pure, the climate agreeable, and the face of the country romantic and beautiful.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="184"><Q>THEN Clara will be delighted with it,</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Bellenden, <Q>for &s;he would rather wander in woods and groves, &s;he &s;ays, than mix in the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable a&s;&s;emblies; nay, I have known her prefer a walk in the mo&s;t &s;olitary part of Hyde-Park, where &s;he could &s;ee nothing but trees and gra&s;s, than accompany me to the Mall, when it has been &s;o crowded with per|&s;ons of fa&s;hion, that we could hardly move.</Q> Here I ob&s;erved Clara ca&s;t down her eyes, and Mi&s;s Loui&s;a &s;miling &s;ignificantly.</P>
<P>'Is &s;olitude your ta&s;te too, Mi&s;s?' &s;aid I. 'No, indeed, Madam,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I like to be among per&s;ons of fa&s;hion; but not in &s;uch a crowd as my &s;i&s;ter &s;peaks of; for then every body looks alike, and there is no di&s;tinction of per&s;ons.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e lights, thus artle&s;sly held out, it was no difficult matter to

di&s;cover the different di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e young ladies; which were made &s;till plainer, by the manner in which their portraits are taken by the inimitable pencil of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who&s;e pieces are &s;o full of mind, that you have the character, as well as form, of tho&s;e who &s;it to him.

'I was re&s;olved,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>to have them drawn before we left England, and by our great arti&s;t; becau&s;e they are de&s;igned for pre&s;ents to &s;ome of their neare&s;t re|lations.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="186">SHE then directed my eyes to the por|trait of Mi&s;s Bellenden, which was placed in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the room. It is a whole-length, and finely executed. She is dre&s;&s;ed for a ma&s;querade; her habit that of a Cir|ca&s;&s;ian Lady; &s;he holds her ma&s;que in one hand, and, with the other, adju&s;ts a curl of her bright auburn hair, which &s;eems falling on her ivory neck; her countenance expre&s;&s;es all the &s;elf-com|placency of con&s;cious beauty, and com|municates to the &s;pectator part of that plea&s;ure which &s;he her&s;elf feels in the contemplation of it.</P>
<P>WHILE I was gazing attentively upon this fini&s;hed piece, Mi&s;s Bellenden, who &s;eemed impatient for my opinion, glided up to me, and &s;aid in a loud whi&s;per, <Q>the painter has flattered me exce&s;&s;ively; yet, I think, there is &s;ome re&s;emblance.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Neville took the word, and, in a high &s;train of compliment, expatiated
<PB N="183" REF="187">
upon the beauties of the picture, and the &s;kill of the arti&s;t.</P>
<P>MISS Bellenden &s;miled, and interrupt|ing him at la&s;t, &s;aid, <Q>but I would have Mrs. Neville's opinion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE painter has done you ju&s;tice, Madam,</Q> &s;aid I, 'and only ju&s;tice.'</P>
<P>'AH,' replied &s;he, <Q>I perceive you can compliment as well as your lord here.</Q></P>
<P>I LEFT it to Mr. Neville to &s;atisfy the lady's &s;cruples about our veracity, and turned my eyes upon Mi&s;s Loui&s;a's pic|ture; her dre&s;s is a robe of pale blue &s;attin, ornamented with fe&s;toons of flowers; her hair hangs in loo&s;e ring|lets upon her fine turned neck, and its luxurious growth about the forehead and temples is confined by a tiara of pearls; &s;he is repre&s;ented &s;tanding in a garden; her left arm leaning on a marble column;
<PB N="184" REF="188">
her right extended towards a beautiful little boy, as if to receive a &s;mall ba&s;ket of flowers, which he offers her. Her attitude is extremely graceful, and cal|culated to mark the dignity of her form; &s;he &s;miles upon the child who pre&s;ents her with the flowers, who &s;eems to have gathered them from a parterre at a di&s;|tance, to which he points. There is a beautiful di&s;tinction between the flowers on her robe, and tho&s;e in the ba&s;ket: we &s;ee that the former are artificial, only becau&s;e they are contra&s;ted with the others, which look like nature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>'You have gazed long enough,' &s;aid the colonel, <Q>upon the&s;e two fine ladies; now let me have your opinion of my little pa&s;toral nymph here.</Q> Mi&s;s Loui&s;a, while we were looking at her picture, &s;tood by with an air quite ea&s;y and unconcerned; and replied to our compliments no otherwi&s;e than by a re&s;pectful curt&s;ey.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="189">My attention was now fixed upon the picture of my young favourite; which, both for de&s;ign and execution, is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pieces I ever &s;aw. She is repre&s;ented in a wood, and as ju&s;t ri&s;en from the foot of a &s;preading oak; her book, a large folio volume, lying near it; a young fawn, at a di&s;tance, &s;eems ha&s;tening to hide it&s;elf in a thicket; a length of ribband, which it trails along, &s;hews that it has been her cap|tive, and has made its e&s;cape; &s;he &s;eems &s;pringing forwards to recover it; a &s;weet anxiety is expre&s;&s;ed in her animated countenance; her hair is tied behind with a ribband, and floats in the wind. The admirable &s;ymmetry of her form is &s;hewn to advantage by a thin white robe, which &s;he gathers up with one hand, that it may not impede her flight; the other &s;he holds out invitingly to|wards the little animal. I perceived the book was lettered on the back, it was Sidney's Arcadia; I &s;miled. <Q>That is a romance, is it not, Madam?</Q> &s;aid
<PB N="186" REF="190">
Mrs. Bellenden; <Q>Clara is very fond of tho&s;e &s;ort of books, too fond I think.</Q> Clara blu&s;h'd, and &s;eemed apprehen&s;ive of more rebukes on this &s;ubject. <Q>It is a romance, Madam,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>but it is a very ingenious work, and contains excellent le&s;&s;ons of morality: it was wrote by one of the brave&s;t &s;oldiers, and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed gentlemen of the age he lived in; an age too, that was fruitful in great men.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I SEE you are an advocate for ro|mances, Mrs. Neville,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Bel|lenden, half grave, and half &s;miling, <Q>and indeed, you are &s;till of an age to reli&s;h them.</Q> I &s;miled a&s;&s;entingly; and the Colonel leading me again to the drawing-room, the di&s;cour&s;e turned upon matters relating to our intended voyage, and the country we were going to, till it was time to take leave.</P>
<P>I AM apprehen&s;ive this voyage will take place &s;ooner than I expected; but I
<PB N="187" REF="191">
could ea&s;ily reconcile my&s;elf to all the difficulties of it, except parting with you, my dear Maria.&mdash;Alas! this is a &s;ubject I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf to write on.</P>
<P>THIS moment your &s;hort letter (which to make amends for its &s;hortne&s;s, it mu&s;t be owned is very &s;weet) is brought me. By lavi&s;hing &s;uch prai&s;es on me, you do me a favour no doubt, but I cannot &s;ay you do me ju&s;tice; and you &s;eem to have a de&s;ign to plea&s;e me at the hazard of offend|ing truth. But you will tell me, the&s;e high commendations come from your uncle and Mr. Greville&mdash;'Tis well, I will rate them then at their ju&s;t value; for do we not all know, my dear Maria, what po|litene&s;s obliges men of wit and gallantry to, when ladies are the &s;ubjects of their panegyric? &mdash;but enough of this. Write to me &s;oon; let me know all that pa&s;&s;es in this little excur&s;ion; every thing in|tere&s;ts me that relates to you. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is &s;ome comfort to me to reflect, that if you mu&s;t take this hated voy|age, the Bellenden family will afford you agreeable companions in it. Mr. Greville is well acquainted with the Co|lonel: he &s;peaks of him with a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m. In the language of Pope, he cried out,
<Q><L>A wit's a feather, a chief's a rod,</L>
<L>An hone&s;t man's the noble&s;t work of God.</L></Q>
'Colonel Bellenden,' &s;aid he, <Q>is that noble&s;t work; and to this truth the candid bear te&s;timony by their words, and detractors by their &s;ilence.</Q> I a&s;ked him his opinion of the ladies.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="193">'MRS. Bellenden,' he &s;aid, <Q>by her politene&s;s and attention to plea&s;e, &s;up|plies, in &s;ome degree, the defect of her education; which being confined to mere accompli&s;hments, as they are called, has left the nobler powers of her mind uncultivated. She &s;ings well; &s;he dances finely; &s;he performs on the harp&s;ichord with great &s;kill; &s;he can carry on the &s;mall talk of a tea-table in French; draws prettily; and is al|lowed to &s;hade her flowers in embroi|dery extremely well; but her read|ing has been wholly confined to her P&s;alter and Bible, a few devotional tracts, and &s;ome &s;ermons; and, among profane authors, the Seven Cham|pions of Chri&s;tendom, pamphlets, poems, and &s;ome other works of the &s;ame kind. She has a great contempt for what &s;he calls book-learning in women; and thinks cha&s;tity and good breeding, for &s;o &s;he pairs them, the highe&s;t of female virtues. She is an obedient wife, a tender mother, and
<PB N="190" REF="194">
an ea&s;y companion; is gentle in her cen&s;ures of her acquaintance, except when they offend again&s;t the laws of mode&s;ty, or the rules of ceremony, and then, it mu&s;t be owned, &s;he is very &s;evere.</Q></P>
<P>'YOUR characters,' &s;aid I, <Q>&s;eem to be drawn with &s;o much &s;kill, that I wi&s;h to have Mi&s;s Bellenden's by the &s;ame hand. She will be the companion of my dear friend in a long voyage, and I &s;hall be happy to know that &s;he will be an agreeable one.</Q></P>
<P>'I DO not,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>think Mi&s;s Bellenden qualified to be an agreeable companion to one of your friend's &s;olid under&s;tanding: but &s;he is good-tempered, and will not give offence; &s;he is very hand&s;ome, and has no idea of any higher excellence in women than beauty; &s;he is greedy of admiration, and would be a coquet, if &s;he had wit enough to &s;ecure her
<PB N="191" REF="195">
conque&s;ts; but although nature directs her to throw the bait, and the gaudy fry often catch at it, yet &s;he has not &s;kill enough to bring her prey to land; and they always e&s;cape her. The&s;e di&s;|appointments affect her but little; for a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new conque&s;ts keeps her in good humour with her own charms, and leaves her no lei&s;ure to regret, that their effect is not la&s;ting.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HER two &s;i&s;ters are too young to have any character yet; but they are both fine girls in their per&s;ons; and Clara, the younge&s;t, &s;eems, I think, to give the promi&s;e of being &s;uperior to the others, in the endowments of her mind.</Q> <Q>My friend has found that out already,</Q> &s;aid I. 'Then,' replied Mr. Greville, <Q>I &s;hall have &s;ome opi|nion of my own penetration.</Q></P>
<P>MY uncle this moment &s;ends to let me know that he is ready, and the car|riage
<PB N="192" REF="196">
is at the gate. We are to &s;pend a week at lea&s;t at Mr. Greville's, and from thence my next letter will be dated, unle&s;s I &s;hould find lei&s;ure to write to you at the inn where my uncle puts up the fir&s;t night. Ever, ever your's,</P>

<HEAD>MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bell Inn.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE we are, my dear Euphemia, &s;omewhat fatigued with our journey, for the roads were very heavy, and the day unplea&s;ant; and, to complete our di&s;&s;atisfaction, we met with &s;ome di&s;agreeable occurrences on our arrival at this place, which have had a &s;urpri&s;|ing effect on my uncle's temper, and for which, at pre&s;ent, I can by no means account.</P>
<P>WHEN our carriage drove into the inn-yard, a young gentleman, who was talking to Mrs. Deering, the landlady, ha&s;tily advanced, and with great polite|ne&s;s offered his hand to help me out:
<PB N="194" REF="198">
he bowed low to my uncle, and ob&s;erv|ing that he de&s;cended with &s;ome diffi|culty, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with equal atten|tion; my uncle thanked him very cor|dially, which the young gentleman an|&s;wered only by a mo&s;t re&s;pectful bow, and withdrew. Both my uncle and I thought him extremely hand&s;ome; and indeed, my dear Euphemia, he has a mo&s;t engaging countenance, and is one of the fine&s;t figures I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>MRS. Deering having conducted us to a parlour, appeared to be in &s;ome confu&s;ion. 'Your honour,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>u&s;ed always to give me notice when you intended to come here, and then I prepared every thing for your recep|tion.</Q></P>
<P>'AND have you not had notice,' &s;aid my uncle; <Q>I &s;ent Robert before me, early in the morning.</Q> 'Indeed, Sir,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>not a &s;oul has been here from you: and I am in the greate&s;t quan|dary
<PB N="195" REF="199">
in the world; for I have not a bed for your honour, my hou&s;e is &s;o full: I can make a &s;hift to accommodate the young lady, if &s;he will put up with a little bed in a dark clo&s;et, and her maid can &s;leep with one of mine; but the room your honour u&s;ed al|ways to have, is engaged by that young gentleman you &s;aw in the yard, and I have not another room in the hou&s;e, but what is taken up.</Q></P>
<P>MY uncle fretted very much at this di&s;appointment, and at the negligence of the groom. <Q>What is to be done, Maria?</Q> &s;aid he to me; <Q>do you think you can bear the fatigue of tra|velling to the next &s;tage this cold dark night?</Q></P>
<P>'I CAN bear it very well, Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>but I am &s;ure you cannot; therefore, I mu&s;t entreat that you will accept of the dark room and the little bed Mrs. Deering talks of; and Fanny &s;hall &s;it up with me in this room: here are two
<PB N="196" REF="200">
ea&s;y chairs; and if I can get a book, I &s;hall pa&s;s my time well enough.</Q> <Q>I cannot con&s;ent to that,</Q> &s;aid my uncle; then turning to Mrs. Deering, who had uttered a thou&s;and good lacks all the time, he ordered her to get a boiled chicken for&s;upper; and in the mean time he would re&s;olve upon &s;omething.</P>
<P>I CONTINUED to pre&s;s my uncle to agree to my propo&s;al; which he could not prevail upon him&s;elf to approve.</P>
<P>ALL this time we heard nothing of the groom. The night became wet and &s;tormy. I trembled for my uncle's health; for he was immoveable in his re&s;olution not to let me &s;it up all night; but rather to go forward to the next &s;tage; when Mrs. Deering entered the room &s;miling, and told us, that the young gentleman, who had engaged the room, hearing of the inconveniences we were likely to &s;uffer for want of an apartment, had politely re&s;igned it to
<PB N="197" REF="201">
my uncle; and was actually &s;et out on hor&s;eback, in the mid&s;t of the &s;torm, in order to reach the hou&s;e of a friend, who lived about ten miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>'BLESSINGS on his heart for it!' &s;aid Mrs. Deering, <Q>it was as good a deed as ever was done; and it was all his own offer.</Q></P>
<P>MY uncle appeared very much af|fected with this young man's civility. 'Who is he?' &s;aid he to Mrs. Deering: <Q>I hope I &s;hall have an opportunity, &s;ome time or other, of thanking him.</Q> 'He is your name&s;ake,' &s;aid Mrs. Deer|ing.</P>
<P>'HARLEY!' interrupted my uncle, im|patiently, 'Who's &s;on is he?'</P>
<P><Q>He is &s;on to the Reverend Doctor Harley,</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Deering; <Q>and is ju&s;t returned from Germany. He was &s;ent to get his learning at a
<PB N="198" REF="202">
<HI>Ver&s;ity</HI> there; becau&s;e his father, it &s;eems, is not rich, and could not main|tain him at one of our own <HI>Ver&s;ities.</HI></Q></P>
<P>My uncle had been u&s;ed to this good woman's language, and was able to li&s;ten to her gravely; but it was with &s;ome difficulty that I could help &s;miling. However, my mirth was immediately clouded, when ca&s;ting my eyes upon my uncle, I perceived all the marks of a&s;toni&s;hment, anger and confu&s;ion in his countenance.</P>
<P>'PRAY ha&s;ten &s;upper,' &s;aid he to Mrs. Deering, at the &s;ame time making a motion to her with his hand to be gone. She left the room; and he continued to walk about in it &s;ilently, with a ha&s;ty un|equal &s;tep.</P>
<P>My a&s;toni&s;hment at this evident di&s;|compo&s;ure, kept me &s;ilent al&s;o for &s;ome moments. At length I a&s;ked him, if
<PB N="199" REF="203">
any thing extraordinary had happened, to make him unea&s;y.</P>
<P>'YES,' replied he, throwing him&s;elf into a chair, <Q>I have rea&s;on to be un|ea&s;y, when, contrary to my intentions, I am laid under obligations to per&s;ons I hate. This young fellow has in|&s;ulted me by his mock-civility. Can|not you gue&s;s who he is?</Q> <Q>Is he not, Sir,</Q> &s;aid I, 'related to us?'</P>
<P><Q>HE is &s;o, to your and my misfor|tune,</Q> &s;aid he. <Q>His father is my enemy, my mortal enemy: and upon him, &s;ince I have no male heir, my e&s;tates are entailed. Oh! that my brother had left me a &s;on in&s;tead of a daughter!</Q></P>
<P>'WELL, Sir,' &s;aid I, endeavouring to laugh him out of his ill humour, <Q>it is always misfortune enough to be a woman, without any aggravation. But I am not avaricious; and you have
<PB N="200" REF="204">
made me as rich as I de&s;ire to be. I wi&s;h, indeed, your heir was more wor|thy of your regard. But has this young man affronted you, as well as his fa|ther?</Q></P>
<P>'His father is a villain!' cried my uncle, &s;tarting from his chair, and pacing again furiou&s;ly about the room; then &s;uddenly &s;topping, and gra&s;ping my hand eagerly.</P>
<P>'OH! Maria,' &s;aid he, <Q>I have cau&s;e for hatred; that ba&s;e man betrayed me! betrayed me in the tendere&s;t point! betrayed me, who was his kin&s;|man, his friend, his benefactor!</Q></P>
<P>HIS voice failed; his eyes filled with tears; he turned from me, and throw|ing him&s;elf again into his chair, fixed his looks, altered as they were from rage to melancholy, &s;tedfa&s;tly upon the fire.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="205">WHILE he continued in this affecting &s;ilence, I could not refrain from tears; which I endeavoured to conceal, upon Mrs. Deering's entrance with &s;upper. Sir John was &s;o ab&s;orbed in thought, that he did not perceive &s;he was in the room; I drew near to tell him &s;oftly, that &s;upper was on the table.</P>
<P>'I HOPE his Honour is not ill!' &s;aid Mrs. Deering, coming up officiou&s;ly to|wards him. 'Sir John is fatigued,' &s;aid I, 'with his journey.' <Q>Ah! no doubt of it,</Q> &s;aid &s;he. <Q>What a mercy it was, that his honour did not go fur|ther to-night. Ble&s;&s;ings on good young Mr. Harley, for leaving us his bed!</Q></P>
<P>At that name my uncle &s;tarted up in &s;ome emotion; and then, for the fir&s;t time, perceiving our loquacious land|lady, he recollected him&s;elf, and drew his chair near the table.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="206">'IT is a bitter night,' pur&s;ued &s;he; <Q>poor heart! I warrant he is drenched through with the rain by this time: but as long as his Honour is &s;afe and warm, I am contented.</Q></P>
<P>SENSIBLE how much my uncle mu&s;t &s;uffer in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his mind, by this woman's idle talk, I de&s;ired her to get his apartment ready for him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; 'for I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>you will choo&s;e to retire when you have &s;upped?</Q> 'Certainly,' he &s;aid: upon which Mrs. Deering with|drew.</P>
<P>MY uncle, &s;till pen&s;ive and &s;ilent, carved the chicken, helped me and him|&s;elf, but &s;carce ate any thing; and my &s;upper being fini&s;hed as &s;oon as his, he drank one gla&s;s of wine; and ordering his valet, who attended, to light him to his room, he wi&s;hed me a good night, and left me.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="207">I WAS glad to be alone, that I might give free vent to my tears; for the gen|tle melancholy my uncle fell into, after the fir&s;t &s;allies of his anger were over, af|fected me greatly. I could have wi&s;hed he had opened his heart to me, and ac|quainted me with the cau&s;e of his enmity again&s;t his kin&s;man. That there was no cordiality nor corre&s;pondence between them, I knew; but I never imagined their differences were of a nature to ex|cite &s;uch a &s;trong and la&s;ting enmity. But what has this poor young man done, to de&s;erve &s;o great a &s;hare of my uncle's di&s;like? for it &s;eems he never &s;aw him before, and was di&s;po&s;ed to like him, till he heard his name: and indeed, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that he has &s;ome|thing extremely intere&s;ting in his coun|tenance, and his per&s;on and addre&s;s are engaging to a great degree. Poor youth! his complai&s;ance may probably co&s;t him dear; the night is dark and &s;tormy, his road lies acro&s;s the country, and he has ten miles to travel, with no attendant
<PB N="204" REF="208">
but an old countryman, whom, at a large expence, he hired to &s;erve him as a guide.</P>
<P>HERE is Mrs. Deering with her ala&s;&s;es! again; &s;he puts a thou&s;and frightful thoughts into one's head. I have al|ways ob&s;erved, that low people take a plea&s;ure in creating fears, when there is no cau&s;e for them, and in aggravating them when there is. But I will go to-bed: I am tired, but not &s;leepy. I have been writing ever &s;ince my uncle left me.&mdash;Good night, my dear Eu|phemia.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THREE O'CLOCK.</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT &s;leep, the tempe&s;t without is &s;o violent; and, to &s;ay the truth, the agitations of my mind have rai&s;ed a kind of tempe&s;t within me. I am ri&s;en, and I am got again to my pen. I dread the &s;eeing my uncle; his unea&s;ine&s;s af|fects me greatly, Methinks, I can now
<PB N="205" REF="209">
account for his ill-&s;uited marriage with Mi&s;s Fenwick.&mdash;Doubtle&s;s, he hoped for an heir, to di&s;appoint the expectations of his hated kin&s;man, and his race. But, why &s;hould his race be hated too? What|ever the father's guilt may be, ought it to involve the innocent &s;on? Ble&s;s me! there is a loud knocking at the gate. This &s;tormy night has driven &s;ome be|wildered travellers hither. Poor Mr. Harley! perhaps, he too, may be in difficulties. Good Heaven! how they thunder at the gate! This impatience &s;peaks &s;ome emergency. So, the hou&s;e is rou&s;ed, I perceive: my window looks into the inn-yard; cold and dreary as it is, I mu&s;t open it, and &s;ee what is the matter.</P>
<P>A POST chai&s;e drives into the yard; they help a man out of it, who &s;eems to be hurt: &s;ome dreadful accident has happened. I mu&s;t ring for &s;omebody to come to me; I am terrified, and can|not bear to be alone.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="210">ALAS! my dear Euphemia, the wounded man I &s;aw brought in is Mr. Harley! My maid, whom the noi&s;e had wakened, came to my chamber; I &s;ent her to make &s;ome enquiries; &s;he returned with my uncle's groom, who told me, that the young gentleman was dangerou&s;ly hurt. I was exce&s;&s;ively an|gry with this fellow, by who&s;e neglect all this mi&s;chief has been brought about. I could hardly bear him in my &s;ight; yet I was impatient to know, how he happened to be in Mr. Harley's com|pany, for he was in the chai&s;e with him, it &s;eems: he told me, after &s;ome awk|ward excu&s;es for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which I impatiently interrupted, that having met with a brother, who was ju&s;t re|turned from &s;ea, and whom he had not &s;een for many years, he was by him per&s;uaded to go into a public hou&s;e; where drink and di&s;cour&s;e beguiled the time, he &s;aid, in &s;uch a manner, that it was late in the evening before they parted; but the &s;torm was &s;o violent,
<PB N="207" REF="211">
that he could not have proceeded, if he had not met with a returned po&s;t-chai&s;e, the driver of which was his acquaint|ance, who invited him to take a &s;eat in it; he &s;et out with his friend, who promi&s;ed to leave him at this inn. In their way, they were alarmed with the cries of a man, who begged them to alight, and a&s;&s;i&s;t a gentleman, who&s;e hor&s;e had thrown him, and who, he be|lieved, was dangerou&s;ly hurt: this was poor Mr. Harley, my dear. They found him lying under a tree, which af|forded him but indifferent &s;helter again&s;t the rain; and in this condition, it &s;eems, he had remained near an hour, being unable to ri&s;e, much le&s;s to &s;it his hor&s;e; and in all this time, no carriage of any &s;ort had pa&s;&s;ed by till their arrival; his guide, poor fellow! had taken off his own great coat to cover the poor youth as he lay, &s;upporting his head upon his knees, hollowing in vain for help, where there was none to hear; and uncertain whether he ought to leave him, in that
<PB N="208" REF="212">
condition, to &s;eek for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or &s;tay near him, in expectation that Providence would &s;end them relief.</P>
<P>WITH &s;ome difficulty they rai&s;ed him, and put him into the chai&s;e; Robert &s;upporting him in it. The hu|manity he had &s;hewn upon this occa&s;ion prevented any further reproaches from me for his negligence, and I promi&s;ed to prevail with my uncle to pardon him; who, upon the report of what had hap|pened, had ri&s;en, and having &s;ent to know if I was up, de&s;ired I would come to him in the parlour. He took notice that my eyes were red. <Q>I do not blame you for your &s;en&s;ibility,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>I am concerned, as well as you, for the accident that has happened to this young man. That I &s;hould be un|de&s;ignedly made, in part, the occa&s;ion of it, is one of tho&s;e good turns which I am u&s;ed to meet with from that family.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="213">I PERCEIVED he was in an ill humour; &s;o I made him no an&s;wer to this &s;peech, which, I thought, was a very &s;trange one at this time. He walked ha&s;tily backwards and forwards in the room, as his manner is, when he is vexed.</P>
<P>'I HAVE &s;ent to tell Mrs. Deering,' &s;aid he, <Q>that &s;he may accommodate her gue&s;t with my bed, which I have left for that purpo&s;e; &s;o there, I think, we are even.</Q> There was no an&s;wering to this, you know; &s;o I was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>'I AM impatient to be gone,' pur&s;ued he, <Q>therefore ring, and order &s;ome breakfa&s;t to be prepared immediately; we will &s;et out as &s;oon as it is light.</Q></P>
<P>I RUNG, and my maid appearing, I ordered her to get breakfa&s;t ready: <Q>for I &s;uppo&s;e,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>they have bu&s;ine&s;s enough below to employ them.</Q> My uncle looked withfully at Fanny, then at me, as if de&s;irous to know what was pa&s;&s;ing. I a&s;ked no que&s;tions, though
<PB N="210" REF="214">
I was really in a great deal of anxiety my&s;elf, being re&s;olved to &s;ee how far good nature would work. He &s;eemed di&s;appointed when Fanny went out of the room; and going to the door, called her back.</P>
<P>'WHY do you not tell us,' &s;aid he, 'how the gentleman is?' <Q>He is very bad, Sir,</Q> &s;aid Fanny; <Q>he is very much brui&s;ed, and has got a large cut on the &s;ide of his head, for it &s;eems he fell again&s;t a huge &s;tone that lay in the road: Mrs. Deering &s;ays, he bleeds like a pig, and he has fainted away twice. There is no &s;urgeon to be had nearer than the next town, and that is &s;even miles off.</Q></P>
<P>MY uncle now walked about fa&s;ter than before. 'Cur&s;ed accident!' mut|tered he: then, &s;uddenly &s;topping, <Q>Is any one gone for this &s;urgeon?</Q> a&s;ked he, ha&s;tily. Fanny told him, a man and hor&s;e were gone full &s;peed. <Q>Well, make ha&s;te with breakfa&s;t,</Q> &s;aid he,
<PB N="211" REF="215">
<Q>it grows light; and tell the men to get the carriage ready; I will be gone immediately.</Q></P>
<P>MRS. Deering brought in the choco|late her&s;elf, and told us, that as good luck would have it, one of her gue&s;ts, being a phy&s;ical gentleman, had vi&s;ited Mr. Harley, who was now in bed; that he &s;aid, he ought to be bled immedi|ately, and undertook to do it him&s;elf, though he did not practi&s;e that profe&s;|&s;ion; that he had <HI>&s;ub&s;cribed</HI> &s;omething to anoint his brui&s;es, and to compo&s;e him to &s;leep; and that he was actually in a fine breathing &s;weat, and was very quiet.</P>
<P>SIR John, I could ob&s;erve, li&s;tened to her &s;trange jargon very attentively, which, at any other time, would have made me &s;mile. But I was really con|cerned for the young gentleman, ex|tremely concerned; it was natural I &s;hould be &s;o, for he is our kin&s;man, you
<PB N="212" REF="216">
know, and whatever may be his father's demerits, he is blamele&s;s.</P>
<P>MY uncle heard all &s;he &s;aid without making any reply; and having drank his chocolate, &s;eated him&s;elf in an ea&s;y chair, complaining that he was very &s;leepy. I retired to my own room, and wrote thus far, expecting to be &s;oon &s;ummoned to depart, for I &s;ee the coach is drawn out. Methinks I could with the &s;urgeon was come, that we might have his opinion of the poor young man's ca&s;e: common humanity, you know, my dear, would &s;ugge&s;t this. Sure, Sir John will not go till he knows what de|gree of danger Mr. Harley is in. I was mi&s;taken; he &s;ends this moment to know if I am ready. &mdash;Well, I will at|tend him.</P>

<P>I AM retired for the night to my own chamber; the fatigue and agitation of the day affording me a rea&s;onable ex|cu&s;e
<PB N="213" REF="217">
for de&s;iring early re&s;t; but I &s;hall devote an hour or two to you before I go to-bed.</P>
<P>I TOLD you, my uncle &s;ent to let me know he was ready to &s;et out from the inn, and I ha&s;tened down to him. I found him reading a news-paper, and &s;o lei&s;urely, that he even read all the adverti&s;ements; at length, he laid down the paper, walked to the window, and looked at his watch. My maid coming in with my cloak, he a&s;ked her, <Q>If the &s;urgeon was come?</Q> She an&s;wered, 'No;' but that the coach was ready.' I ro&s;e up, my uncle gave me his hand; I thought we were going away immediately, when he &s;topped &s;hort at the parlour door: 'I fancy, Maria,' &s;aid he, <Q>you would be glad of a di&s;h of tea before you go; you have had very little re&s;t, it will refre&s;h you, and you are not u&s;ed to breakfa&s;t upon chocolate.</Q></P>
<P>IT appeared to me, that my uncle was de&s;irous of &s;taying till the &s;urgeon
<PB N="214" REF="218">
came, though he would not own it. I accepted his propo&s;al, and tea was or|dered. In about half an hour after|wards, Fanny told us the &s;urgeon was come: 'Well,' &s;aid my uncle, with an a&s;&s;umed carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, <Q>we &s;hall now hear his opinion of this ca&s;e.</Q> And accord|ingly Mrs. Deering came, in a great hurry, to tell us.</P>
<P>'WELL, Heaven be prai&s;ed,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>matters are not &s;o bad as we imagined; Surgeon Parker has examined the wound, and &s;hook his head; but &s;ays, he hopes it will not be attended with very great danger. He is a fine man; he will cure him, if any body can. He &s;ays, the young gentleman is very much brui&s;ed, but he hopes not dan|gerou&s;ly; and his fever is pretty high, but he hopes not dangerous. He &s;ays, he mu&s;t be kept quiet; for it will be a work of time to &s;et him upon his legs again. Oh, he is a fine man; the young gentleman will be very &s;afe in
<PB N="215" REF="219">
his hands. But I mu&s;t go, and get ready the things he has <HI>&s;ub&s;cribed</HI> for him.</Q> And accordingly &s;he left us, in as great a hurry as &s;he came in.</P>
<P>'I FANCY this fine man,' &s;aid my uncle, half &s;miling, <Q>will make a fine job of this.</Q> Then pau&s;ing a little; the wounded gentleman,' &s;aid he, <Q>is probably not provided with money enough to an&s;wer &s;uch extraordinary expences as he may be brought into; and the wretch, his father, lives at a great di&s;tance: can you think of any method, Maria, of conveying this to him,</Q> taking a bank-note of fifty pounds out of his pocket-book; <Q>it will hurt his delicacy, I &s;uppo&s;e, to put it into Mrs. Deering's hands for his u&s;e.</Q> I could have wi&s;hed my uncle had completed this act of bene|volence, by making Mr. Harley a vi&s;it, and giving it to him&s;elf; but I dur&s;t not mention this to him.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="220">'THERE is no other way, Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>than to inclo&s;e it, and &s;end it to him by Mrs. Deering.</Q> He &s;aid, that would do; and taking his hat, walked into the garden, to give me an oppor|tunity. Accordingly, I inclo&s;ed the note in a blank &s;heet of paper, and &s;ealed it with my own cypher. I then &s;ent for Mrs. Deering, and de&s;ired her to deliver it to Mr. Harley her&s;elf. She told me he was a&s;leep, which I was glad to hear; and, &s;miling &s;ignificantly, a&s;|&s;ured me, he &s;hould have it as &s;oon as he waked. She was going to oppre&s;s me with her u&s;ual loquacity; but my uncle coming in, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort. He gave me his hand to lead me to the coach, and we drove away immediately; my uncle not once &s;peaking to me, till we came within five miles of Greville|park; when he perceived Mr. Greville, on hor&s;e back, coming to meet us; and he pointed him out to me.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="221">MR. GREVILLE, full of the plea&s;ure this vi&s;it gave him, &s;aid a great many civil thing to me; and thanked Sir John for the favour he did him, in prevailing upon me to accompany him. But my uncle continued to be grave and pen&s;ive; &s;o that when we arrived at the Park, Mr. Greville, as he handed me out of the coach, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at the humour his friend &s;eemed to be in; and a&s;ked me, in a whi&s;per, What was the matter? I replied, That we had met with &s;ome di&s;agreeable accidents at the inn, which, I &s;uppo&s;ed, Sir John would acquaint him with; and that I &s;hould then expect an explanation from him; for I knew he was too much in his confi|dence, to be ignorant of any thing that materially concerned him.</P>
<P>THIS iS a delightful &s;eat, my dear Euphemia; &s;weetly romantic in its &s;itu|ation and pro&s;pects. The hou&s;e is not very large, but elegant, and furni&s;hed with great ta&s;te. I complimented the
<PB N="218" REF="222">
hou&s;e-keeper, who is a grave ma|tronly woman, upon the exqui&s;ite neat|ne&s;s that reigned in all the apartments. That which is allotted for me, during my &s;tay, is one of the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAVE had a long conver&s;ation with Mr. Greville this morning. My uncle, being a little fatigued with his journey, did not accompany us in our walk in the park, which is a very exten&s;ive one. I was impatient to know what had pa&s;&s;ed between them, after I left them la&s;t night, concerning our adventures on the road; and Mr. Greville, to my wi&s;h, entered of him&s;elf into the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><Q>So, Sir John has &s;een his young kin&s;|man,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I find. It mu&s;t have been a trying interview for him; and, no doubt, opened all tho&s;e wounds, which neither time nor rea&s;on have been able entirely to heal.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="223">'What are tho&s;e wounds,' &s;aid I, <Q>which, in a mind &s;o generous as my uncle's naturally is, could produce &s;uch fatal effects, as to make him confound innocence with guilt, and reject the blamele&s;s &s;on for the faults of the of|fending father? Yet, it mu&s;t be owned, that, angry as he was, he for|got not the duties of humanity.</Q></P>
<P>'THAT is exactly my friend,' replied Mr. Greville; <Q>his pa&s;&s;ions may &s;ome|times mi&s;lead him, but his inclinations are always good, and never fail to bring him again into the right path. But you will not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the continuance of his re&s;entment again&s;t the father, when you know the inju|ries he has received from him; and I have his leave to make you acquainted with them. <Q>For I am not willing,</Q> &s;aid he,  <Q>that my niece &s;hould think meanly of me, as &s;he probably will, till &s;he is convinced, that my re&s;ent|ment
<PB N="220" REF="224">
is but proportioned to the of|fence that has been given me.</Q></Q></P>
<Q><P>You mu&s;t know then, that Sir John and Dr. Harley had contracted a great friend&s;hip for each other in their early youth. They received the fir&s;t rudiments of their education at the &s;ame academy, and were &s;ent to|gether to the &s;ame univer&s;ity. Dr. Harley's father was but in indifferent circum&s;tances, and would have found it very difficult to have &s;upported his &s;on at college, had not his expences been liberally &s;upplied by your uncle, who&s;e father, Sir Henry Harley, gave him a very large allowance. The two friends were in&s;eparable; and their mutual attachment was &s;o &s;teady and &s;o ardent, that they were called Pila|des and Ore&s;tes. Mr. Harley, your uncle, during one of the vacations, became acquainted in a gentleman's family, the daughter of which was ex|qui&s;itely
<PB N="221" REF="225">
hand&s;ome, and highly accom|pli&s;hed; for her father, having no for|tune to give her, was at an expence for her education, which but little &s;uited his circum&s;tances, not doubting but her beauty, aided by &s;uch advantages, would procure her a very honourable e&s;tabli&s;hment. Your uncle conceived a violent pa&s;&s;ion for her; he made her a declaration of it, which was not ill received; but the prudent young lady referred him to her father, which put matters in &s;uch a train, that your uncle was &s;oon engaged in a formal matri|monial addre&s;s, which, for the pre|&s;ent, however, was to be carried on &s;ecretly, as it was not expected that Sir Henry would be ea&s;ily prevailed upon to give his con&s;ent, and the young gentleman was &s;till ma&s;ter enough of him&s;elf, to reject all thoughts of a complete di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>HIS young kin&s;man, you may be &s;ure, became his confident; and he
<PB N="222" REF="226">
undertook to manage a corre&s;pond|ence between the lovers; which, for &s;ome time, was carried on undi&s;covered; at length, &s;ome hints of the affair had been given to Sir Henry, who, when his &s;on came next to vi&s;it him, cau&s;ed him to be watched &s;o clo&s;ely, that he &s;oon became ma&s;ter of the whole &s;ecret. He came to an explanation with his &s;on, who had too much candour to deny his attachment to Mi&s;s Denby; but a&s;&s;ured him, that he never entertained a thought of engaging him&s;elf further without his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>SIR HENRY &s;eemed &s;atisfied with this a&s;&s;urance, and gave him to under|&s;tand, that he relied entirely upon his honour, and expected that he would break off this connexion; and, to make all &s;ure, propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould &s;et out immediately upon his travels. This was a &s;ad &s;troke: Mr. Harley en|deavoured to ward it off by many bad arguments, which he brought to prove,
<PB N="223" REF="227">
that it would be better to defer this expedition for a year at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>SIR HENRY, who never had recour&s;e to authority when the ca&s;e in que&s;tion could be decided by rea&s;on, was &s;en|&s;ible, that to combat pa&s;&s;ion with re|mon&s;trances was engaging with un|equal arms; therefore he put an end to the debate with a po&s;itive <HI>I will have it &s;o;</HI> and preparations were immedi|ately made for his departure.</P>
<P>THE lovers, at parting, exchanged a thou&s;and vows of con&s;tancy, and their faithful confident promi&s;ed to manage their corre&s;pondence as u&s;ual, which went on un&s;u&s;pected for near a year when Mr. Harley's governor di&s;co|vered it by chance, and gave imme|diate notice to Sir Henry.</P>
<P>THE Baronet began now to appre|hend very &s;erious con&s;equences from a pa&s;&s;ion which had &s;tood the te&s;t of
<PB N="224" REF="228">
time and ab&s;ence; and the active part young Harley had taken in the affair giving him ju&s;t offence, he &s;ent for him in order to reprove him &s;everely for it. Mr. Harley, finding it in vain to deny the truth to one who was too well informed, pleaded in his own excu&s;e the force of friend &s;hip, and in your uncle's, the fa&s;cinating power of Mi&s;s Denby's charms; and on this la&s;t point he &s;poke &s;o feelingly, as put a &s;cheme into Sir Henry's head, which, if it &s;ucceeded, would effectually prevent the misfortune he feared from his &s;on's imprudent at|tachment.</P>
<P>DROPPING therefore the fir&s;t &s;everity of his tone and a&s;pect, he began to ex|po&s;tulate mildly with him.</P>
<P>"IF my &s;on," &s;aid he, <Q>continues his addre&s;&s;es to this girl, he will of|fend me greatly; but, if he &s;hould be mad enough to marry her, never let him hope for my pardon; I will
<PB N="225" REF="229">
bani&s;h him from my heart, and from my &s;ight for ever; tell him this, and u&s;e all your influence with him to pre|vent &s;uch an in&s;ult to parental autho|rity; in doing &s;o you will &s;hew your friend&s;hip to him, and will &s;ecure mine to your&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Harley's father was lately dead and had left him a very &s;mall fortune; he had taken orders, but had little hopes of obtaining any preferment in the church but by the intere&s;t of Sir Henry. He perceived all the advan|tages of this opening towards gaining his confidence and friend&s;hip; and Sir Henry was convinced by the &s;upple|ne&s;s of his an&s;wers, that it would not be a very difficult matter to lead him as far as he plea&s;ed. He re&s;olved, therefore, to explain his whole de&s;ign at once, founding his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in it, on the ob&s;ervations he had made on the warmth with which the young man expatiated upon the beauty and merit of Mi&s;s Denby. He knew that
<PB N="226" REF="230">
the &s;horte&s;t way to per&s;uade was to plea&s;e; therefore, he in&s;tantly propo|&s;ed to him to marry the young lady him&s;elf, whom he would portion with a thou&s;and pounds, and give him the rever&s;ion of the living of&mdash; which was worth three hundred pounds a year, and was likely to be &s;oon va|cant, the pre&s;ent incumbent being then above four-&s;core.</P>
<P>THE once faithful Pilades could not re&s;i&s;t the&s;e &s;trong temptations; he &s;acrificed his Ore&s;tes without &s;cruple, per&s;uading him&s;elf that the friend&s;hip he had vowed for him required that he &s;hould u&s;e every means in his power to prevent his incurring the guilt of di&s;obedience to his fathers; and know|ing that in great affairs there are no &s;mall &s;teps, he went boldly to work, repre&s;ented to Mr. Denby the danger of offending a man &s;o powerful by his fortune and intere&s;t as Sir Henry Har|ley; by encouraging his &s;on's clan|de&s;tine addre&s;s to Mi&s;s Denby; that
<PB N="227" REF="231">
the young gentleman him&s;elf did not entertain a thought of marrying her without his father's con&s;ent, which would never be obtained; that the Baronet's death alone could open a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in this affair; and this pro&s;pect, con&s;idering the vigour of his years and con&s;titution, was very remote. He advi&s;ed him, therefore, to li&s;ten to another propo&s;al for his daughter, which, though not &s;o &s;plen|did yet was certain, and might be productive of more happine&s;s.</P>
<P>MR. Denby was a rea&s;onable man; he con&s;idered that nothing is le&s;s cer|tain than the future&mdash;nothing apter to deceive than hope. He was anxious to &s;ettle his daughter, and re&s;olved not to reject a pre&s;ent good for the bare po&s;&s;ibility of a greater in future; and, after &s;ome reflection, de&s;ired Mr. Harley to explain him&s;elf, which he accordingly did, relating very can|didly Sir Henry's propo&s;al; for even
<PB N="228" REF="232">
knaves can be hone&s;t when their inte|re&s;t points that way.</P>
<P>THE two gentlemen were &s;oon agreed; the greate&s;t difficulty &s;eemed to be the per&s;uading Mi&s;s Denby to this new regulation:&mdash;but even this was got over in a little time, either becau&s;e the young lady's pa&s;&s;ion for her ab&s;ent lover was not very violent, or &s;he had given way to a growing inclination for the pre&s;ent; or, what indeed was mo&s;t likely, the precarious condition of her fortune, her &s;ole de|pendence being upon the life of her father, who&s;e health was declining, and who&s;e income, ari&s;ing from a place in the revenue, did not enable him to lay up any thing for her future &s;up|port.</P>
<P>SIR Henry had &s;oon the &s;atisfaction to hear that this marriage was com|pleted; he performed the fir&s;t part of his promi&s;e immediately, and cau&s;ed the
<PB N="229" REF="233">
thou&s;and pounds he gave Mi&s;s Denby to be &s;ettled on her&s;elf; and in a very few weeks he was enabled to perform the &s;econd part of it; the living be|came vacant, and Mr. Harley was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>YOUR uncle was at Bru&s;&s;els, on his way to England, when he heard of this marriage, which, upon report, he did not believe: but a letter from his father put it pa&s;t a doubt. He received one at the &s;ame time from Dr. Harley, which he returned un|opened. He made no reproaches, he expre&s;&s;ed no re&s;entment; &s;atisfied with the re&s;olution he had taken, never for the future to hold any conver&s;e with a man who had &s;o ba&s;ely betrayed him, he confined his grief and rage within his own brea&s;t; and, in his letter to his father, took not the lea&s;t notice of what had hap|pened, but de&s;ired he would approve of his intention to continue abroad &s;ome time longer.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="234">DR. Harley was deeply wounded by the contemptuous &s;ilence of his injured friend, which carried with it more keen reproach than the &s;evere&s;t invectives. His remor&s;e, it was &s;aid, co&s;t him a fit of &s;ickne&s;s; and he had the mor|tification to find that Sir Henry, though he profited by his treachery, yet de&s;pi&s;ed him for it, confining his acknowledgments to the bare per|formance of his promi&s;e, withoutkeep|ing up any corre&s;pondence with him, or pu&s;hing his intere&s;t any further.</P>
<P>YOUR uncle continued on the con|tinent three years longer, vi&s;iting mo&s;t of the European courts; and being furni&s;hed with remittances to make a large expence, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o effectually, that he returned to Eng|land perfectly cured of his pa&s;&s;ion; but retaining all his re&s;entment again&s;t the perfidious pair who had &s;o ba&s;ely betrayed him.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="235">SIR Henry pre&s;&s;ed him to marry, to which he &s;eemed greatly aver&s;e; and when his father, to prevail upon him, mentioned the entail of his e&s;tates upon Mr. Harley in default of i&s;&s;ue in his line, your uncle &s;aid, his bro|ther's marriage might as effectually prevent that misfortune as his. Ac|cordingly Mr. Edward Harley was, with the con&s;ent of all parties, mar|ried to your amiable mother; and Sir Henry, before he died, had the &s;atis|faction to be grandfather to three fine boys and your&s;elf. It plea&s;ed Heaven, however, to take your brother to him|&s;elf; and your parents, too much af|fected with their lo&s;s, followed them in a few months. Then it was that your uncle re&s;olved upon marriage, but was not able to fix till he &s;aw Mi&s;s Fenwick. A mo&s;t judicious choice, as it has proved; and he has now the mortification to know, that the per&s;on whom he hates mo&s;t, and has mo&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="236">
rea&s;on to hate, plumes him&s;elf with the hope of &s;ucceeding to his fortune.</P></Q>
<P>THIS was what Mr. Greville told me, my dear Euphemia; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that my uncle's fixed re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the elder Mr. Harley is very ju&s;tifiable. It was natural, you know, my dear, to be a little inqui&s;itive about the character of the &s;on. Mr. Greville, it &s;eems, knows him very well, having met him &s;everal times in com|pany &s;ince his return from Leyden. He &s;peaks of his merit in very high terms: he &s;ays he is a mo&s;t amiable youth, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine under&s;tanding, and be&s;ides being an excellent &s;cholar, is highly accompli&s;hed. He re&s;embles his father, he &s;ays, in nothing but the graces of his per&s;on; and even in the&s;e he has the advantage of him.</P>
<P>'HE would be no bad repre&s;entative,' added Mr. Greville, <Q>of the honours
<PB N="233" REF="237">
of your family; but, if it be true what &s;ome have ob&s;erved, that the qua|lities of the mind are hereditary, though the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is not always ob&s;erved, young Harley may have a &s;on that will re&s;emble his grandfather, and di&s;grace tho&s;e honours.</Q></P>
<P>I SMILED at this conceit, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was glad to hear &s;o good an account of the young man, for I was willing to be ju&s;tified in the favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &mdash; I mean the good opi|nion I had conceived of him from his very polite and engaging behaviour. <Q>Mr. Greville told me that he would di&s;|patch a man and hor&s;e to-day to the Bell Inn, to know how the young gen|tleman is, and, by &s;ome means or other,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I will contrive to let Sir John know the &s;tate of his health, about which I am &s;ure he has good nature enough to be anxious, though he will not own it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="238">OUR walk ended with this little hi&s;|tory. My uncle him&s;elf mentioned Mr. Harley, and &s;aid he &s;hould be glad to know if the young man's hurt was really as bad as the &s;urgeon repre&s;ented it.</P>
<P>'WE &s;hall know, pre&s;ently,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>for I ordered Will, as he pa&s;&s;ed by the Bell Inn, to enquire; he mu&s;t be come back I &s;uppo&s;e by this time.</Q> &mdash; He rang the bell, and Will him&s;elf appeared, &mdash; <Q>Well, how is the wounded gentleman?</Q> &s;aid Sir John, carele&s;sly. &mdash; 'Sir,' replied the man, <Q>he is much better; &s;o well, in|deed, that he talks of &s;etting out to|morrow in a po&s;t chai&s;e for his fa|ther's hou&s;e; but the &s;urgeon and Mrs. Deering &s;ay he is mad to think of any &s;uch thing, and would fain have him &s;tay a week longer, at lea&s;t; but the young gentleman &s;eems to be a very po&s;itive young gentleman, and will do as he plea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="239">WHEN William left the room, my uncle &s;aid he was glad the young man was not likely to be a great &s;ufferer by his civility, which, whether it proceed|ed, &s;aid he, from an intere&s;ted policy, or real benevolence, I profited by, and therefore owed him my thanks for it: and now, that the matter is all over, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon never having his name mentioned to me again.</P>
<P>HE &s;poke this with &s;o &s;evere a look, and in &s;o firm an accent, that Mr. Gre|ville did not think fit to make any re|ply; much le&s;s did I, you may be &s;ure. But is this ju&s;t, my dear Euphemia, to &s;hew &s;o much rancour? &mdash; Rancour did I &s;ay! no, that is too har&s;h a word. My uncle is incapable of harbouring any rancour in his brea&s;t; but &s;o much di&s;like to one who never offended him&mdash; one who&s;e amiable qualities &mdash; yes, I think that prai&s;e may be allowed to him from what we ob&s;erved of his behaviour, even though Mr. Greville may have
<PB N="236" REF="240">
drawn his character with &s;ome exaggera|tion. But why &s;hould one &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. Greville, who&s;e penetration and &s;incerity nobody ever called in que&s;tion, could either be mi&s;taken in the cha|racter of this youth, or draw it in fal&s;e colours? If then he is what he repre|&s;ents him to be, and what his behavi|our to us gives us rea&s;on to think he is, I mu&s;t &s;ay it is unrea&s;onable, nay, it is unju&s;t in my uncle to con|found him with his unworthy parents, and make him an&s;werable for their faults.</P>
<P>I EXPECTED to have had a letter from you by ye&s;terday's po&s;t. How does it happen that I am di&s;appointed? Does the Bellenden family engro&s;s you wholly? Have you not a few moments to &s;pare to your friend? Let me not accu&s;e you of neglect, my Euphemia; at this time it would affect me greatly. &mdash;I am low-&s;pirited&mdash;I know not why, but I am really &s;o; and yet have I not
<PB N="237" REF="241">
too much cau&s;e for low &s;pirits&mdash;are we not to be &s;eparated, perhaps for ever? Mr. Greville quarrels with me for &s;pend|ing &s;o many hours in the Park; its ro|mantic &s;cenes charm me&mdash;<Q>&s;olitude is the nur&s;e of tender thought,</Q> the poet &s;ays; and in the &s;ilence and gloom of the&s;e &s;hades I undergo the melancholy reveries of divided friend&s;hip&mdash;divided, but never to be le&s;&s;ened.&mdash; Yes, my dear Euphe|mia, I think of you with more tender|ne&s;s than ever; my fortitude has quite for&s;aken me, and my tears flow at the bare idea of our &s;eparation. How then &s;hall I &s;uppre&s;s the trial when it comes? But I mu&s;t lay down my pen; Mr. Greville makes an entertainment to|morrow for &s;ome of the neighbouring families, who come to welcome us to this part of the country; and my maid tells me it is time to dre&s;s. The po&s;t carries you a large packet this time. Adieu.</P>
