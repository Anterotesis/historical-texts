<P>DR. KENRICK having advi&s;edly de&s;erred the printing of his edition of Shake&s;peare till that of Mr. Steevens appeared, the expediency of carrying his work into im|mediate execution is &s;o much abated, by the labours of that Commentator, and the contributions of his corre&s;pondents, that its intended publication is, for the pre&s;ent, laid a&s;ide. The appearance, however, of a mutilated <HI>play-hou&s;e</HI> copy, under the au&s;pices of the MANAGERS, from who&s;e affected veneration for Shake&s;peare better things might have been expected, has not only alarmed the poet's ad|mirers in general, but &s;ugge&s;ted that &s;ome pertinent ob|&s;ervations on his writings might be now opportunely communicated to the public in a more entertaining me|thod. Dr. K. de&s;irous of returning, by the earlie&s;t means, the obligations he lies under to his &s;ub&s;cribers, has therefore adopted the &s;ugge&s;ted expedient of delivering &s;ome part of his comment, with the corre&s;pondent parts of the text, in public Lectures.</P>
<P>He has entered, indeed, the more readily into this de&s;ign, as there are a number of pa&s;&s;ages in dramatic writers, particularly in Shake&s;peare, which cannot be &s;uc|ce&s;sfully elucidated without the aid of declamation. As to the title, which he has (too quaintly perhaps) pre&s;umed to give this attempt; the public may remember they were promi&s;ed, many years ago, the &s;peedy publication of a
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
work, to be entitled A SCHOOL OF SHAKESPEARE; but, as that performance has not yet appeared, and will now probably never make its appearance, the Lecturer thinks no farther apology nece&s;&s;ary, for a&s;&s;uming a title &s;o well adapted to his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>N. B. The Sub&s;cribers to Dr. K's Shake&s;peare will be admitted to the whole cour&s;e without farther &s;ub&s;cription; or, if di&s;&s;atisfied, may have their former &s;ub&s;cription re|turned.</P>
<P>&dtristar;The communications of critical readers, tending to throw &s;uch lights on the poetical or moral beauties of Shake&s;peare, as may have e&s;caped his commentators, will be gratefully received and properly applied.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>A PROFESSED panegyric on the genius of Shake&s;peare, has been the u&s;ual preface to the various editions of his writings. A &s;cholia&s;t, like a tran&s;lator, is almo&s;t univer&s;ally the encomia&s;t of his author. A rhetorical expo&s;itor, therefore, will not be expected to break through a cu&s;tom; which affords &s;o great a &s;cope for declamation! But, to recite, what has been often written, will yield little &s;a|tisfaction to my auditors; and, to advance any thing new on a &s;ubject, which has employed the pens of the greate&s;t wits, for almo&s;t two centuries pa&s;t, is an attempt above my pre&s;umption. For, though too much cannot be &s;aid in prai&s;e of our in|comparable poet, it may be impertinent to attempt to &s;ay more than has already been &s;o well &s;aid by others. Formal encomiums re&s;emble mere compliments; which are the more futile and &s;uperfluous, as they rather tend to depreciate, than enhance, extraordi|nary merit.</P>
<P>It will, I flatter my&s;elf, be a more en|tertaining and u&s;eful ta&s;k to exemplify the particular excellencies, which ju&s;tify our
<PB N="2" REF="6">
univer&s;al admiration of this favourite bard, than to expatiate, in general terms, on his &s;uperiority of genius. General admirers are caught by &s;uperficial attractions; and, however enthu&s;ia&s;tic their devotion, it u&s;u|ally depends on the &s;lightne&s;s of their ac|quaintaince with the object of their ido|latry.</P>
<Q><HI>Pools</HI> may ADMIRE, but <HI>men of &s;en&s;e</HI> APPROVE!</Q>
<P>Approbation, therefore, mu&s;t &s;econd out <HI>applau&s;e,</HI> to give it &s;terling value and prove our attachment real.&mdash;But, to <HI>approve</HI> we mu&s;t <HI>under&s;tand,</HI> and fully to under&s;tand &s;o comprehen&s;ive and &s;ublime a writer as Shake&s;peare, is perhaps not quite &s;o ea&s;y as is generally imagined. At lea&s;t there are many, and tho&s;e <HI>not uncritical</HI> readers, who are ingenious enough to confe&s;s that, after repeated peru&s;als of his works, they &s;eldom recur to him, without meeting with &s;ome new difficulty to &s;urmount, or excellence to admire.</P>
<P>Not that I have pre&s;umed to invite my auditors to a dull enumeration of <HI>verbal</HI> errors, the dry inve&s;tigation of doubtful phra&s;eology, or the ellucidation of ob&s;curi|ties,
<PB N="3" REF="7">
ari&s;ing from ob&s;olete diction and vulgar allu&s;ions; many of them too mean to ex|cite curio&s;ity, or too long lo&s;t to be worth the labour of re&s;earch.&mdash;Thanks to the &s;uc|ce&s;sful indu&s;try of more laborious criticks, they have relea&s;ed me, in a great mea&s;ure, from the painful ta&s;k of a&s;certaining am|biguities, di&s;entangling intricacies, and re|covering the meaning of terms, long lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s of antiquity!</P>
<P>The text of Shake&s;peare gives room for a more plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive comment. The poetical beauties and defects of this wonderful bard, who&s;e works are allowed to afford the mo&s;t numerous as well as con|&s;picuous in&s;tances of both, fall under the immediate cognizance of the liberal &s;cho|lia&s;t. Hence Mr. Pope affirms, that his writings not only pre&s;ent the faire&s;t and fulle&s;t &s;ubject of critici&s;m; but that, to cri|tici&s;e on them effectually, would be the be&s;t method to form the judgment and ta&s;te of our nation.&mdash;This were an arduous at|tempt indeed! An attempt, in which &s;o many of the leviathans of literature have failed, that it might be ju&s;tly deemed arro|gance in me to re&s;ume it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8">It is near twenty years &s;ince the admirers of Shake&s;peare were publickly addre&s;&s;ed, in favour of an Editor, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ge|nius, of which it was &s;aid, as of Cae&s;ar,
<Q>The Alps and Pyreneans &s;ink before it.</Q>
From him we were promi&s;ed an edition w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y of the author and him&s;elf: in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> the beauties of the former were to be pointed out agreeably to the &s;ublime imagination of the editor; who had con|fe&s;&s;edly all the requi&s;ite qualifications of a great critic.
<Q>Quid dignum tanto &s;eret hic promi&s;&s;or hiatu!</Q>
Nothing!&mdash;The promi&s;er was no prophet; this mighty genius, after buoying up the public expectation for about ten years, mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly failed in the execution of his de&s;ign. His edition had hardly ap|peared, before a new one was &s;et on foot by the very proprietors who had employed him; &s;oliciting eleemo&s;ynary contributions: which were levied, in much about the &s;ame time, with &s;ucce&s;s on the public.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t compilation, which, to the honour of the conductor, may be &s;tiled a
<PB N="5" REF="9">
&s;tupendous monument of verbal critici&s;m; almo&s;t every thing is done but that which &s;eems mo&s;t wanted; an illu&s;tration of the poetical beauties and moral excellencies of the writer. This was deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential|ly nece&s;&s;ary by Mr. Pope and Dr. War|burton, that they thought it incumbent on them to di&s;tingui&s;h, by their manner of printing, the more &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages of the author, &s;o as to arre&s;t the attention of the indolent, and direct the judgment of the ignorant, reader.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on, indeed, cen&s;ures this prac|tice as u&s;ele&s;s, or rather hurtful. Its only effect, &s;ays he, is to preclude the plea&s;ure of judging for our&s;elves; to teach the young and ignorant to decide without prin|ciples; to defeat curio&s;ity and di&s;cernment, by leaving them le&s;s to di&s;cover; and at la&s;t to &s;hew the opinion of the critick, without the rea&s;ons on which it was found|ed, and without affording any light by which it may be examined.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent Lectures (which are offered, however, as a mite only into the general trea&s;ury of expo&s;i|tion) I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hun this cau&s;e of cen&s;ure, by laying down the principles
<PB N="6" REF="10">
and giving &s;uch rea&s;ons of approbation or cen&s;ure, as may enable my auditors to judge for them&s;elves; without preventing the exerci&s;e of their own curio&s;ity, or al|together depriving them of that &s;elf-com|placency which attends the congratulation of one's own di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>It were to &s;uper&s;ede the expediency of all cla&s;&s;ical expo&s;ition, &s;hould we adopt the maxim, "that a reader is never plea|&s;ed with the meaning of a writer, unle&s;s it be immediately obvious to his own ap|prehen&s;ion."</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch is the a&s;&s;ertion of that learned commentator, who in&s;i&s;ts on the facility of comprehending the works of Shake|&s;peare in the following terms of amplifica|tion. <Q>A de&s;cription of the obvious &s;cenes of nature, a repre&s;entation of general life, a &s;entiment of reflection or ex|perience, a deduction of conclu&s;ive ar|gument, a &s;orcible eruption of effer|ve&s;cent pa&s;&s;ion, are to be con&s;idered as proportionate to common apprehen|&s;ion, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by critical officiou&s;ne&s;s; &s;ince, to conceive them, nothing is more requi&s;ite than acquaintance with the general &s;tate of the world, and tho&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="11">
faculties which he mu&s;t almo&s;t bring with him who would read Shake&s;peare.</Q></P>
<P>&mdash;But, granting that Shake&s;peare's reflec|tions, rea&s;onings and repre&s;entations, were univer&s;ally obvious, and that per&s;ons of every capacity po&s;&s;e&s;s the faculties of com|prehending them; it is not &s;o much the exertion of abilities as of attention that is in this ca&s;e required. The poet can be but half-read by half-readers; for the works of Shake&s;peare will by no means rank with tho&s;e frivolous productions, which our Engli&s;h Ari&s;tophanes facetiou&s;ly calls pret|ty light &s;ummer reading.</P>
<P>Pope, in his E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, &s;ays, we &s;hould read
<Q><L>&mdash;a work of wit</L>
<L>With the &s;ame &s;pirit that its author writ.</L></Q></P>
<P>To do ju&s;tice to the poet and our&s;elves, therefore, in the reading of Shake&s;peare, we &s;hould &s;ummon up all our attention to his &s;ubject. The immediate compre|hen&s;ion of flights of genius and force of argument, requires that both the imagina|tion and judgment &s;hould be wide awake. It is not enough that the eye of an indolent reader run carele&s;sly over the page of &s;uch
<PB N="8" REF="12">
a writer, to take in, at &s;o cur&s;ory a view, the full extent of his meaning. Even a more intent peru&s;er will &s;ometimes fail to &s;eize (in a moment) that combination of ideas, which may have co&s;t the mod ready writer, the labour of days, weeks, months, to collect, compare and combine.</P>
<P>Congenial talents, it is true, like drops of a &s;imilar fluid, readily coale&s;ce: men of the &s;ame turn for observation, and of &s;imilar modes of thinking, ea&s;ily under|&s;tand each other: but this is not the ca&s;e with others, who differ as well in opi|nion as intellectual abilities. To &s;uperior geniu&s;es, who may them&s;elves affect to vie with the great ma&s;ter of our Engli&s;h drama, my lectures may afford as little in&s;truction as amu&s;ement. But in this exten&s;ive metro|polis, I pre&s;ume there are to be found a &s;ufficient number of his more humble ad|mirers, to whom they may prove both acceptable and u&s;eful, however futile or frivolous they may &s;eem to men of &s;uper|lative ingenuity.</P>
<P>As to the expediency of their oral de|livery, it may be pleaded, that the proprie|ties of dramatic compo&s;ition &s;trike more forcibly from recital, than in peru&s;al. The
<PB N="9" REF="13">
able&s;t commentator on Shake&s;peare might di&s;cover, in the declamation of a Quin or a Garrick, many exqui&s;ite &s;trokes of cha|racter, pa&s;&s;ion and humour, evidently de|&s;igned by the poet, which yet Would other|wi&s;e e&s;cape the notice of the mere literary critick. Nay, it is even po&s;&s;ible that the poet him&s;elf (who, it mu&s;t be remembered, was but an indifferent &s;tage-player) did not intend all tho&s;e nice touches and for|cible &s;trokes of expre&s;&s;ion; which an able actor or artful declaimer might, by pro|priety of pau&s;e, &s;ignificance of tone, and variety of cadence, give his writings in re|cital.</P>
<P>This may &s;eem an here&s;y, too bold to come from an orthodox admirer of Shake|&s;peare, e&s;pecially if we admit the ju&s;tice of the ingenious encomium, pa&s;&s;ed on him by one of his late&s;t and be&s;t commentators. Shake&s;peare, &s;ays &s;he, (for we are told the encomia&s;t is a Lady) &s;eems to have had the art of the dervi&s;e, in the Arabian tales; who could throw his &s;oul into the body of another man, and be at once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his &s;entiments, adopt his pa&s;&s;ions, and ri&s;e to all the functions and feelings of his &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="14">But perhaps this elegant eulogy, though &s;upported by as beautiful and pertinent an allu&s;ion, may be no farther applicable than to the &s;entimental powers of the writer, and not to the corre&s;pondent &s;en&s;ations, or, in Dr. John&s;on's phra&s;e, efferve&s;cent pa&s;|&s;ions of the man. The poet (like the der|vi&s;e) might be able to throw his &s;oul into the unanimated body of another, without being able to accommodate his own body to the feelings and pa&s;&s;ions of another's &s;oul: in which ca&s;e, however ju&s;tly he might &s;peak the general language of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, he might &s;till learn &s;omething from tho&s;e who could feel, as they &s;poke, from them&s;elves. If the Gho&s;t in Hamlet (as we are told) was the be&s;t part his powers of declamation could arrive at; he could not per&s;onally a&s;&s;ume the characters or di&s;|play the feelings he &s;o pathetically de&s;cribes, while he dictates their proper language to others.</P>
<P>But, be this as it may, with re&s;pect to Shake&s;peare, it is well known to have been the ca&s;e with many modern authors, who have been a&s;toni&s;hed at the latent meaning, that has been di&s;covered in their compo&s;i|tions, by a Garrick a Clive, or a Pritchard. It even happens in compo&s;ition, that a &s;en&s;e,
<PB N="11" REF="15">
more pertinent, &s;ublime or profound than at fir&s;t intended, is often &s;truck out by a happy colli&s;ion of words, as unfore&s;een as unpremeditated. If pa&s;&s;ages of this kind are &s;ometimes fortuitou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted to the writer, how much oftener will his genius, or art, de&s;ignedly pre&s;ent them to the reader; who is not to be wondered at, if he content him&s;elf with the more obvious meaning, that floats on the &s;urface; with|out diving into the depths of his author.</P>
<P>A line or two from almo&s;t any cla&s;&s;ical writer will afford an exemplary in&s;tance.&mdash;In Iago's celebrated &s;peech on the ine&s;ti|mable value of a good name, he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Who &s;teals my <HI>pur&s;e,</HI> &s;teals <HI>tra&s;h.</HI> 'Tis &s;omething, nothing.</L>
<L>'Twas <HI>mine,</HI> 'tis <HI>his</HI> and has been <HI>&s;lave</HI> to <HI>thou&s;ands.</HI></L></Q>
I believe &s;uch in general is the manner in which tho&s;e lines are repeated. And yet there &s;eems to be a want of meaning in the words <HI>&s;omething, nothing,</HI> &s;o delivered. The antithe&s;is in the &s;econd line, al&s;o, is confined to the various po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in the words <HI>mine, his,</HI> and <HI>thou&s;ands.</HI> Whereas, if we conceive the &s;peaker to pau&s;e, on call|ing
<PB N="12" REF="16">
his <HI>pur&s;e, tra&s;h,</HI> then to admit it to be <HI>&s;omething,</HI> or make it a que&s;tion; and af|terwards go on, as if upon farther thought, more forcibly to undervalue it, by calling it expre&s;sly <HI>nothing,</HI> the &s;en&s;e would be greatly improved. Again, if we extend the antithe&s;is in the &s;econd line, or rather di&s;tingui&s;h another, between the words, <HI>'Twas, 'tis</HI> and <HI>has been,</HI> denoting the fu|tility of the po&s;&s;i&s;&s;ion, as merely temporary and tran&s;itory; the pa&s;&s;age would, in this ca&s;e, be much more pregnant of mean|ing.
<Q><L>Who &s;teals my <HI>purse,</HI> &s;teals <HI>tra&s;h</HI> &mdash;'Tis <HI>&s;omething!</HI>&mdash; Nothing&mdash;</L>
<L>'TWAS <HI>mine,</HI> 'TIS <HI>his</HI> and HAS BEEN &s;lave to <HI>thou&s;ands.</HI></L></Q>
A &s;imilar in&s;tance of the double antithe&s;is is to be found in the fir&s;t hook of Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t: where Satan &s;ays, it is
<Q>Better to <HI>reign</HI> in <HI>Hell</HI> than <HI>&s;erve</HI> in <HI>Heaven.</HI></Q>
If I remember right, Mr. Quin, as well as &s;ome other celebrated readers of Milton, gave no farther meaning or energy to this line; although it is evident, from the con|text, that the antithe&s;is is double, and re|quires
<PB N="13" REF="17">
a farther di&s;tinction of empha&s;is be|tween <HI>reigning</HI> in <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>&s;erving</HI> in <HI>Hea|ven,</HI>&mdash;The fallen &s;pirit is addre&s;&s;ing his companion in revolt, on the &s;ubject of their new abode, the infernal world; of which having taken a &s;urvey; he thus exclaims
<Q><L>&mdash; Here, at lea&s;t,</L>
<L>We &s;hall be free; th' Almighty</L>
<L>&mdash; will not drive us hence,</L>
<L>Here we may reign &s;ecure; and, in my choice,</L>
<L>To reign is worth ambition tho' in Hell:</L>
<L>Better to REIGN in <HI>Hell</HI> than SERVE in <HI>Heaven.</HI></L></Q>
Innumerable are the pa&s;&s;ages in poetical and particularly dramatic compo&s;itions, where the whole meaning of the writer is not more obvious to the reader; nor more ea&s;ily explained, without the aid of declamation; which, when it is ju&s;t and emphatical, renders farther explanation unnece&s;&s;ary. A proper, tho' &s;imple, recital of the text is hence often a better comment than whole pages of written annotations.</P>
<P>A judicious actor is, therefore, the be&s;t expo&s;itor of the drama. We have a &s;trik|ing in&s;tance of this in Mr. Garrick; who is not improperly &s;tiled a living comment on our author. What a pity that, out of
<PB N="14" REF="18">
&s;o great a number of capital parts as are found in the plays of Shake&s;peare, the walk of this great comedian has (of late years at lea&s;t) been confined to about twelve characters in tragedy, and, I think, to one only in comedy [Benedict.]</P>
<P>Had all the principal per&s;onages, in the dramas of our immortal poet, the advan|tage of the living comment of &s;uch an ex|cellent actor; it would have effectually pre|cluded the pre&s;ent undertaking. But, when &s;o few of them are capitally filled, and the greater part of the re&s;t injudiciou&s;ly &s;hortened, with a view to accommodate them to the incapacities of inferior per|formers, it is doing a piece of ju&s;tice to the poet, to endeavour to re&s;cue his mangled remains from &s;uch injurious mutilators. My auditors will excu&s;e me, however, if I do not affect the grimace and roar of the lock, or the rant and whine of the bu&s;kin. If I have voice enough to make my&s;elf di&s;tinctly heard, and &s;ufficient art in the management of it to convey the meaning of the poet, the end, I propo&s;e, will be an&s;wered, in giving &s;ome &s;atisfaction to his admirers; and, if to them, to the public
<PB N="15" REF="19">
at large; for who is not an admirer of Shake&s;peare?</P>
<P>Admirable as he is to be regarded as a poet, there is al&s;o another light, in which he is &s;eldom pre&s;ented to us, tho' he ap|pears in it, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;till greater ad|vantage. This is that of a <HI>moral philo&s;opher;</HI> his works containing a practical &s;y&s;tem of ethics, the more in&s;tructive and u&s;eful as the precept is almo&s;t every where joined to example. His moral reflections are not like tho&s;e of mo&s;t other play-wrights, an ad|ventitious appendage to the dialogue. On the contrary, they ri&s;e naturally from the; &s;ituation and circum&s;tance of the &s;peaker, and flow &s;pontaneou&s;ly from his lips, as the genuine effu&s;ions of his heart. Hence it is that they make &s;o forcible and la&s;ting an impre&s;&s;ion on the memory, and have per|haps contributed more to form our national character, for humanity, ju&s;tice, and be|nevolence, than all the theoretical books of morality which have appeared in our language.</P>
<P>I am not &s;ingular in admiring this great poet as a philo&s;opher. The learned and in|genious Mrs. Montague ob&s;erves, in like
<PB N="16" REF="20">
manner, that "we are apt to con&s;ider Shake&s;peare only as a poet, but he is certain|ly one of the greate&s;t moral philo&s;ophers that ever lived." The te&s;timony of Mr. Pope, on this head, does the poet the highe&s;t honour, "Shake&s;peare," &s;ay he, "is not more a master of the Great than of the Ridiculous in human nature; of our noble&s;t tenderne&s;&s;es than of our vaine&s;t foibles; of our &s;tronge&s;t emotions than of our idle&s;t &s;en&s;ations!&mdash;Nor does he only excel in the pa&s;&s;ions: in the coolne&s;s of reflection and rea&s;oning he is full as admirable. His &s;enti|ments, on every &s;ubject, are not only in general the mo&s;t pertinent and judicious, hut, by a talent very peculiar, &s;omething between penetration and felicity, he hits on that particular point on which the bent of each argument turns, or the force of each motive depends." Were any thing want|ing more conclu&s;ive, we might recur to the character given of this &s;ublime genius by one little his in&s;erior, Mr. Dryden.

<HEAD>A RETORT COURTEOUS ON THE CRITICKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;pect which individuals owe to public opinion, e&s;pecially when they &s;olicit the public patronage, reduces them to the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;idering every thing as im|portant, which regards the merit of their preten&s;ions. It is this nece&s;&s;ity that ren|ders the remarks of writers, otherwi&s;e in|&s;ignificant, de&s;erving notice. Contemptible as are frequently the anonymous corre&s;pon|dents of new&s;papers, there is &s;carce a reader in town, to whom &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e papers does not appear an oracle. In an age &s;o divided between the bu&s;tle of bu&s;i|ne&s;s and the di&s;&s;ipation of diverti&s;ement, it is no wonder that curio&s;ity &s;hould adopt the means of acquiring knowledge without the trouble of thinking. Our daily chronicles pretend to offer tho&s;e means, and are therefore revered of cour&s;e as oracular. Liable, however, to be deceived either by ignorance or de&s;ign, their deci&s;ions, like tho&s;e of the
<PB N="20" REF="23">
oracles of old, &s;hould be tru&s;ted with caution.</P>
<P>Intere&s;ted in the effect of tho&s;e deci&s;ions re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent undertaking, it is in|cumbent on me to mention their mi&s;take, expo&s;e their errour and correct their mi&s;|conception. Not that I have rea&s;on to com|plain that the majority, or the mo&s;t re&s;pect|able, of our diurnal critics, have not pa&s;&s;|ed &s;ufficient encomiums on my fir&s;t Lecture. The misfortane of it is, they have mo&s;t of them applauded and cen&s;ured in the wrong place; &s;eeming not to have entered fully into my de&s;ign.&mdash;The mo&s;t general objection is, that I am deficient in oratory, and that I cannot "with the true &s;tage-mechani&s;m of proper empha&s;is recite Shake&s;peare's ver&s;ifi|cation." To this, I an&s;wer, that I neither pretend to, nor require, the peculiar talents of an orator, or actor, to deliver a decla|matory comment on that poet. I affect not the grace, but aim merely at the propriety of declamation; as it is by conviction and not per&s;ua&s;ion that I would with to affect my auditors. Did I pretend to oratory, I &s;hould take the trouble to commit my di&s;|cour&s;e, as well as all the pa&s;&s;ages I recite, to memory, &s;o as to be able to repeat them by rote, and a&s;&s;ume the different characters
<PB N="21" REF="24">
of the re&s;pective &s;peakers; without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to deliver them oratorially: and the talk of &s;peaking with energy and propriety for two whole hours without book, is what I am per&s;uaded my auditors will not think it rea&s;onable to impo&s;e on me. The critick of the Public Adverti&s;er, indeed, has furni&s;hed me with a better apo|logy on this head than probably I could make for my&s;elf. He intimates, with a perhaps, what is certainly true, that the Lecturer con&s;iders him&s;elf rather as a teacher than a practitioner of eloquence, as a rhetorical profe&s;&s;or rather than a profe&s;&s;ed orator. "It is notorious, &s;ays the critick, that the dancing-ma&s;ter, who teaches the art of ad|dre&s;s to others, is not the mo&s;t graceful in his own deportment. The drawing-ma&s;ter in&s;tructs his pupils al&s;o in the rudiments of de&s;ign, not by the delicate touches of the pencil, but by the coar&s;e outlines of rough chalk: nay, we even are told there are mu&s;ical connoi&s;&s;eurs, who would rather hear a tune hummed over by a Bach or an Arne, with &s;carce any voice at all, than hear it melodiou&s;ly warbled by a Linley or a Davis."</P>
<P>Had the criticks in general attended to the motto I have adopted from Horace,
<PB N="22" REF="25">
&s;ignifying that "I meant to do the office of a whet&s;tone, which gives an edge to &s;teel, without having any it&s;elf," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>&mdash;Fungar vice cotis Reddere quae&s;errumvalet, ex&s;ors ip&s;a &s;ecandi. <BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> they mu&s;t all have coincided with this writer: but perhaps &s;ome of them did not read it, and it is not impo&s;&s;ible that, being in Latin, &s;ome others might not&mdash;under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>As to what has been &s;aid about "the <HI>&s;tage-mechani&s;m of proper empha&s;is,</HI>" my de&s;ign is in part to explode the <HI>mechanical empha&s;is</HI> of the &s;tage, as altogether impro|per. It is the habitual exerci&s;e of this mode of declamation that mi&s;leads the actor from the meaning of the author. If, while I am endeavouring, therefore, to point out this meaning merely by a different mode of declamation, I am to be judged by the very &s;tandard, which I am exploding; the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the criticks in favour of theatrical habit, places me in a very pe|culiar predicament. The greater the errour I may attempt to correct in &s;tage declaim|ers, the greater the blunder I &s;hall be &s;up|po&s;ed to have committed my&s;elf: unle&s;s indeed, I &s;hould trouble my auditors with a comment on every &s;uch pa&s;&s;age; giving the rea&s;ons for &s;peaking it differently from others; in which ca&s;e the ta&s;k I have un|dertaken

might, in&s;tead of <HI>fifteen</HI> Lectures, require fifty. I &s;hall explain this by. ex|ample.</P>
<P>In the tragedy of Macbeth, there is a celebrated pa&s;&s;age, which, having long puzzled both the actors and commentators, &s;eems at length to have obtained the general &s;anction of being &s;poken in a manner the mo&s;t quaint and ab&s;urd imaginable.</P>
<P>After the murder of Duncan, Macbeth, who&s;e hands are &s;till bloody, exclaims,
<Q><L>Will all great Neptune's <HI>ocean</HI> wa&s;h this blood</L>
<L>Clean from my hand? No; this <HI>my</HI> hand will rather</L>
<L>The multitudinous SEA <HI>incarnadine,</HI></L>
<L>Making the Green, One Red.</L></Q></P>
<P>The players u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q><L>The multitudinous <HI>&s;eas</HI> incarnadine</L>
<L>Making the green one, red.</L></Q></P>
<P>This the criticks objected to, as a bald and puerile mode of expre&s;&s;ion unworthy of Shake&s;peare. But granting that, <HI>making the green one, red,</HI> is a little bald and puerile, the <HI>making the green, One red,</HI> is full as quaint and childi&s;hly affected. Multitudinous &s;ea in the &s;ingular, and <HI>making the Green, One Red,</HI> were however contended for and adopted,
<PB N="24" REF="27">
I think, fir&s;t by Mr. Murphy, afterwards by Mr. Sheridan, by Mr. Macklin, and, if I rightly remember, by Mr. Garrick; as al&s;o by Dr. John&s;on, who reads THY <HI>multitudinous,</HI> conceiving the la&s;t lines to be an apo&s;trophe to Neptune.&mdash;Mr. Steevens reads the <HI>multitudinous</HI> SEAS in the plural, &s;till making the green, One red.&mdash;In my manu&s;cript text, I read partly with one and partly with the other; thinking with Dr. John&s;on it may be <HI>thy,</HI> and with Mr. Steevens that it &s;hould be <HI>&s;eas</HI> in the plural; at the &s;ame time differing with both, as to the <HI>green's</HI> being converted into <HI>red.</HI> Mr. Steevens indeed tells us, that the &s;ame thought occurs in an old play, called the Downfall of the Earl of Huntingdon.
<Q>He made the <HI>green &s;ea red</HI> with Turki&s;h blood.</Q></P>
<P>But with due deference to Mr. Steevens, the thought is not the &s;ame, if we read, "making the green, One red;" there is no glaring ab&s;urdity, though there is much bomba&s;t, in the notion of a green &s;ea be|ing turned by a bloody hand into a red one; but there is as palpable an impropriety in idea as impo&s;&s;ibility in fact; for green, in the ab&s;tract, to be turned, by any means, into red. A green &s;ea may become a red
<PB N="25" REF="28">
&s;ea, but green, the colour, it&s;elf, can never become red: be&s;ides, the epithet multitu|dinous appears in this ca&s;e to be merely ex|pletive and u&s;ele&s;s, e&s;pecially if it be &s;up|po&s;ed to mean, as our Dictionaries, citing this very pa&s;&s;age, explain it, "the having the appearance of, or looking like, a mul|titude." For why looking like a multitude? Such an epithet applied to the &s;ea has here no propriety whatever. But if we take it in the &s;en&s;e in which Shake|&s;peare u&s;es the &s;ame word el&s;ewhere, as meaning manifold, various, of different kinds, &amp;c. there is the utmo&s;t propriety in it.&mdash;The colour of blood being the pre|dominant idea in the mind of Macbeth, it is plain he means by multitudinous &s;ea (or rather &s;eas) the many-coloured or va|riou&s;ly-coloured &s;eas. Geographers have their Black Sea, their White Sea, their Red Sea. And, though a natural philo&s;opher &s;hould que&s;tion whether tho&s;e &s;eas took their name from the different colours of their waters, poetical licence will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify our author in alluding to their appellation: nay, without having recour&s;e to poetical licence, or re&s;ting on nominal qualities, Shake&s;peare might, as a naturali&s;t, advert to the occa|&s;ional variegation really effected in the co|lour of the &s;ea by floods, currents and other
<PB N="26" REF="29">
cau&s;es: all which, however, being little and partial in compari&s;on of the main ocean, who&s;e con&s;tant and general colour is green. Macbeth is made (by a very na|tural and ea&s;y climax) to in&s;inuate that his hand will not only incarnadine any par|ticular &s;ea of what colour &s;oever it be oc|ca&s;ionally tinged; but that it will change even the native colour of the general con|cour&s;e of waters, the main ocean, the GREEN <HI>&s;ea</HI> red.</P>
<P>I therefore read the pa&s;&s;age thus:
<Q><L>Will all great Neptune's <HI>ocean</HI> wa&s;h this blood</L>
<L>Clean from my hand? No; this <HI>my</HI> hand will rather</L>
<L>Thy multitudinous <HI>&s;eas incarnadine;</HI></L>
<L>Making the GREEN one, red.</L></Q>
Now, whither I am right or wrong in the explication of this pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hould read it in this manner; &s;o that, if unapprized of my rea&s;ons for it, the &s;agacious critics, who have &s;o greatly mi&s;taken my de&s;ign, would in all probability think I had committed a blunder for want of the <HI>&s;tage-mechani&s;m</HI> of <HI>proper empha&s;is.</HI> From this in&s;tance, taken from many hundreds of the like nature that might be given) may be deduced a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why I &s;hould not effect the graces of elocution, were I even po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="27" REF="30">
of the powers and talents for di&s;|playing them; and this is, that the &s;trong and pointed mode of artificial declamation which is nece&s;&s;ary to convey and enforce any new or uncommon meaning, by words already well known, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be perfectly under&s;tood, is incompatible with the graceful cadence and voluble flow of oratory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, with the foregoing example taken from Othello, may &s;erve to &s;hew the <HI>reader</HI> al&s;o the expedi|ency of an <HI>oral</HI> comment on the poet; it being impo&s;|&s;ible for the <HI>writer</HI> to convey by letters the empha&s;is and tones made u&s;e of by the <HI>&s;peaker.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In a commentator, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould inve&s;tigate and di&s;clo&s;e all the &s;en&s;e and meaning contained in his author. An orator who &s;peaks in his own character, or an actor who per&s;onates that of another, and would appear the man he repre&s;ents, &s;hould attempt to convey no more &s;entiment than he can accompany with &s;en&s;ibility. On the &s;tage we had rather lo&s;e &s;ight of the author than the actor, who &s;hould make every thing his own, and mean no more than he can deliver with gracefulne&s;s and ea&s;e. An actor, therefore, would &s;ome|times do well de&s;ignedly to &s;ink a quaint or latent &s;en&s;e in a &s;entence overcharged
<PB N="28" REF="31">
with meaning, rather than &s;acrifice the gracefulne&s;s of delivery and propriety of repre&s;entation to the preci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion of a particular idea, when the general mean|ing is natural and &s;ufficiently full and char|racteri&s;tick without it.</P>
<P>Enacting words (&s;ays the late ingenious author of the Actor) is labour too minute.</P>
<P>A commentator, on the other hand, cannot be too particular, preci&s;e and point|ed in-his empha&s;is; even though a di&s;&s;onant or deficient voice &s;hould &s;ubject him to the implication or wanting what he ought not to exert, if he had them, <HI>oratorial abilities.</HI></P>
<P>It is not merely as an orator, however, that I have been cen&s;ured by the criticks. I have been charged as a commentator with having gro&s;sly mi&s;taken my author, in clearing the character of Sir John Fal&s;taff of imputed malignity of di&s;po&s;ition, and in de&s;cribing him as a <HI>harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive, jocular</HI> creature. A writer in the Public ledger advances this charge, among other nmrepre&s;entations in that paper of Thur&s;|day la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32">That Fal&s;taff is a <HI>jocular</HI> creature is uni|ver&s;ally admitted; but that he is <HI>harmle&s;s</HI> and <HI>inoffen&s;ive,</HI> is what neither I, nor, I believe any body el&s;e ever before &s;ugge&s;ted. For my own part, I neither palliated his meanne&s;s nor extenuated his vices; but left him in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his character for gluttony, lying, cowardice and theft. This &s;agacious critick, therefore, mu&s;t be a great latitudinarian in morals and have adopted a very &s;ingular &s;y&s;tem of ethicks, if he holds that a man, who is at once a glutton, a liar, a coward and a thie&s;, is a harmle&s;s inoffen&s;ive creature.</P>
<P>I will appeal, therefore, to my auditors, whether I have not rea&s;on to expect that criticks, who can &s;o readily overlook the vices of mankind, &s;hould have a little more candour toward their &s;oibles and defects. They forget that I told them my lectures were not calculated for auditors of &s;uper|lative ingenuity; but for &s;uch only as are mode&s;t enough to think that the poet, who&s;e intellectual eye in a fine phrenzy rolling, could dart from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven, may have &s;ometimes &s;een farther than is commonly de&s;cried by the mental opticks of unpoetical or un|critical readers.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITION TO THE RETORT COURTEOUS</HEAD>
<P>SUCH is the Retort Courteous to the criticks, which I had the honour of read|ing to my auditors la&s;t Wedne&s;day: to which &s;o many objections, and of which &s;o many mi&s;repre&s;entations, have been &s;ince made in the public papers, that it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for me to make their authors &s;ome reply.</P>
<P>I have in the fir&s;t place been charged with affecting a &s;overeign contempt for new&s;paper animadver&s;ions, and yet &s;toop|ing &s;o low as to profit by them, in impro|ving by the advice they contained. But &s;urely my thinking them at fir&s;t worth my animandver&s;ion is a proof that the contempt, &s;uppo&s;ed to be affected, was not quite &s;o &s;overeign as alledged; e&s;pecially as I am &s;aid to have thought them of &s;till &s;o much more con&s;equence as to pro&s;it by them. It were cruel to deny the authors of the&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="34">
animadver&s;ions the honour of having con|tributed to my improvement, while they admit I am improved. I am con&s;cious, however, of that improvement's being &s;o very little, that it does neither them nor me any great credit.</P>
<P>But, though they admit I have improved by them, they &s;eem determined not to im|prove by me. They allow that my re|marks are ingenious, but not convinc|ing: the critics or rather critic, for like &s;overeign princes, they each write in the royal plurality, of we, us and our|&s;elves.&mdash;One of the&s;e critics in particular, whom I di&s;tingui&s;h as much for his &s;upe|riour ingenuou&s;ne&s;s as ingenuity, admits that my reading of the pa&s;&s;age, cited from Macbeth, is defended in a plau&s;ible man|ner; but that he (I &s;hould &s;ay they) are neverthele&s;s not converts to the doctrine; as they think &s;uch reading exceedingly puerile, bald and improper. As to its baldne&s;s and puerility, I &s;hall not attempt to controvert a matter of elegance and ta&s;te; but I cannot help remarking, as &s;omething whim&s;ical, a critic's calling any expre&s;&s;ion improper, who at the &s;ame time contends for the propriety of &s;aying that the colour green may become red. He might as well
<PB N="33" REF="35">
&s;ay black may become white, nay better for black and white are only the extremes of light and &s;hade merely colourable acci|dents, and not like green and red, genuine and natural colours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Green is at lea&s;t a &s;econdary, if not a primary colour.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This critic &s;ays, <Q>A good logician will be able by &s;ophi&s;try and the artifice of words to cheat the &s;en&s;es.</Q>&mdash;But a good logician never u&s;es &s;ophi&s;try or the artifice of words, &s;o that what he charges on a good logician proves that he means a bad one. Again, he &s;ays, <Q>none but the weak will give up an opinion which was rationally founded on hearing the &s;pecious argument of an able ca&s;ui&s;t.</Q> This is to &s;uppo&s;e that a weak man is better able to found a rational opinion, or judge when it is &s;o founded, than an able ca&s;ui&s;t. The truth indeed is, that the weak in judg|ment are generally the mo&s;t &s;trong in opi|nion: for, as Shake&s;peare &s;ays,
<Q>Conceit the &s;tronge&s;t works in weake&s;t minds.</Q>
Or (not to go out of the line of the critic's reading,) as it is ob&s;erved to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, in the air of a well known Burletta,
<Q>Remember, when the judgment's weak that pre|judice is &s;trong.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">I do not wonder, therefore, that our critic, even though he has con&s;idered, as he &s;ays, and recon&s;idered the point, &s;hould &s;till remain in his former &s;en|timents. Had he given any hint of the manner in which he inve&s;tigated this knotty point, one might judge of the depth and acutene&s;s of his enquiry; and of the grounds of his tenaciou&s;ne&s;s of opi|nion. As it is, he has le&s;t the point as much in the dark as he found it. I will endeavour therefore to elucidate it a little farther. The main difficulty &s;eems to lie in the meaning of the epithet multitudin|ous, which Macbeth gives to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Now to come at the meaning of doubt|ful words in an author there are only two ways; the one by enquiring in what &s;en&s;e they are u&s;ed by the &s;ame and con|temporary writers; and the other by en|tering fully into the &s;entiment, and ex|plaining them by their nece&s;&s;ary connexion with the context. For we mu&s;t not arbi|trarily give &s;uch words the meaning, we may take it into our heads &s;uits be&s;t with the &s;en&s;e, that we give as arbitrarily to the pa&s;&s;age. This were only to make one blun|der give &s;anction to another.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">Now according to the former mode of explanation, multitudinous means as before ob&s;erved, looking like a multitude, al&s;o ma|nifold and various. Shake&s;peare calls the <HI>tongue</HI> multitudinous, meaning multifari|ous, &s;peaking many things or many lan|guages. But neither in Shake&s;peare nor in any of his contemporary writers do we find multitudinous u&s;ed in any &s;en&s;e that will ju&s;tify the various &s;uppo&s;itions that Mac|beth here gives it to the &s;ea, becau&s;e as &s;ome &s;ay, the &s;ea has many waves, or as others, becau&s;e it has many bays, creeks and harbours, or becau&s;e as others will have it, it contains &s;hoals of herrings and mul|titudes of mackrel.</P>
<P>Attending to the &s;econd mode of expla|nation, we &s;hould enter into the &s;entiment and place our&s;elves in the &s;ituation of the &s;peaker, a&s;&s;ume his per&s;onage, and a&s;k our|&s;elves what we &s;hould have &s;aid in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances. The whole attention of Macbeth was engro&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of his bloody hands. His whole thoughts intent on the means of clearing them of that carnadine hue they were &s;o deeply dyed with; &s;o deep indeed, that he &s;ays all Neptune's ocean will not wa&s;h them clean; Nay rather the&s;e hands will incarnadine
<PB N="36" REF="38">
Neptune's &s;eas. Is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that, in this agitation of mind, Macbeth could advert to any other property of tho&s;e &s;eas than that which immediately related to the object before him? Would he call the &s;ea multitudinous becau&s;e it contained a multitude of fi&s;h, as if he were the bu&s;y|brain'd projector of a Briti&s;h fi&s;hery? Im|po&s;&s;ible! It is for tho&s;e rea&s;ons I continue &s;till as firmly fixed in my opinion as the critic in his: to whom, however, being open to conviction, I &s;hall be ready to give it up, if after having really con&s;idered and re-con&s;idered the point, he puts on his con&s;idering cap once again, and gives me a better rea&s;on for his opinion than I have given for mine.</P>
<P>To the critic of the Publick Ledger I am indebted for the mi&s;repre&s;entation of al|mo&s;t every thing he hath noticed; parti|cularly for fal&s;ely charging me with adopt|ing the meanings I explode, and altering the text ot Shake&s;peare to countenance explanations, which I deduce from that text's &s;tanding as it docs. The&s;e mi&s;repre|&s;entations are the more injurious as they &s;ubject me to unju&s;t cen&s;ure and expo&s;e me to unmerited ridicule. If they proceed,
<PB N="37" REF="39">
therefore, from the critic's having unfor|tunately a treacherous memory and to his liberal propen&s;ity to do me, on all occa&s;ions, a good turn, I hope he will, for the future, &s;peak truth and I am armed again&s;t his ma|levolence. It is this writer who repeatedly informs the publick, that the ladies yawn, as he elegantly expre&s;&s;es it, at my lecture, for want of wit and mu&s;ick. But, after &s;uch bad proofs as he has given of his ve|racity, he will give me leave to doubt the fact; for, tho' this gentleman may require a jig or a pun to prevent his falling a&s;leep, I have too good an opinion of my fair auditors to &s;uppo&s;e they cannot be kept, two or three hours, awake, by a comment on Shake&s;peare, without the aid of a je&s;t or the &s;queaking of a fiddle. Indeed I could not conceive that a critic could &s;uppo&s;e my lectures calculated for &s;uch auditors as can be amu&s;ed with the entertainment they now meet with, at the playhou&s;es and the puppet-&s;hews.</P>
