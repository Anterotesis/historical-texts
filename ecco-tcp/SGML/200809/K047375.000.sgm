<P>Here comes Signor Lopez, head man to the Chief Inqui&s;itor of the province, Don Miguel de Lara. Stand back, &s;tand back, and pay your humble obedience to him. <STAGE>(They fall back, and bow to <HI>Lopez</HI> as he enters.)</STAGE></P>

It is really a tormenting thing to be a man of &s;uch con&s;equence. I don't wonder now, that the Ea&s;tern monarchs &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;een &s;o &s;eldom; for, in good truth, the homage that attends greatne&s;s is very trouble&s;ome to men of indolent habits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to &s;ee your Honour look &s;o well to-day.</P>
</SP>

<P>I hope that your Honour likes the&s;e parts, and that you be not di&s;plea&s;ed with the folk here|about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as to the&s;e parts, hone&s;t Diego, they are plea&s;ant enough. Valencia is a pretty province; but for the neighbourhood, my good fellow, that, you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, is mo&s;t diabolical to a man like me, u&s;ed not only to the &s;ociety of Madrid, but who have lived in London and Paris. You may well conceive how wretched is my condition, if you con&s;ider that, with all my ta|lents and information, I am &s;ometimes forced, for want of better company, to come and &s;it a whole hour with &s;uch a bumpkin as you. It is hard, is n't it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry we entertain you &s;o badly; but we do our be&s;t, and always feel your company a va&s;t honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I con&s;ider, and therefore put up with all deficiencies. I am rea&s;onable, and know how to make allowances. Pray have you &s;een the two &s;trangers to-day, that have been in the neigh|bourhood the la&s;t fortnight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Signor Lopez.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whim&s;ical gentlemen! They make free&mdash;&s;eem to feel them&s;elves quite at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>What countrymen are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>What countrymen? Oh, Diego, your
<PB N="3" REF="6">
ignorance of men and manners!&mdash;Can any country but one, produce men mad enough to play &s;uch wild tricks in his Mo&s;t Catholic Maje&s;ty's &s;ober dominions, and in full &s;ight of the habitation of an Inqui&s;itor? No, no, Diego; Engli&s;hmen are the only people who never con&s;ider change of place, but are ju&s;t the &s;ame harum-&s;carum mad|caps in all parts of the world as they are at home: quite as ready to make an uproar in the court of the Great Mogul, as to break a lamp within the liberties of We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not under&s;tand that the&s;e &s;trangers were both from the &s;ame country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did not under&s;tand!&mdash;My dear Diego, you &s;hould only li&s;ten, and let other peo|ple under&s;tand for you! Mark me&mdash;You are of the kingdom of Valencia, I of Ca&s;tille&mdash;yet we are both Spaniards.&mdash;So one of the&s;e &s;trangers is of England, the other of Ireland; which though dif|ferent i&s;lands, yet the natives of both own one country&mdash;one king&mdash;and (this in your ear, Diego) will, with one heart, defend their country and king again&s;t all the re&s;t of the world.&mdash;Here come two mi&s;erable-looking Hidalgos&mdash;fellows, that live in dirt and poverty, from the fear of de|ba&s;ing their noble de&s;cent, by hone&s;tly earning a whole coat and a good meal.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Two Hidalgos enter with great &s;tateline&s;s, and the appearance of extreme poverty.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Save you, &s;ave you. <STAGE>(They return no an&s;wer, but look at him with great contempt, and exeunt.)</STAGE> The&s;e are precious vermin: the mo&s;t wretched paupers, with the pride of princes.&mdash;How &s;oon mu&s;t the nation go to ruin where it is reckoned di&s;honour|able to be indu&s;trious! They have a different me|thod
<PB N="4" REF="7">
of con&s;idering matters in the country I was ju&s;t talking of. In&s;tead of &s;eeing, as we do here, nobility made ridiculous by its entailing on future generations lazine&s;s and poverty, in England you will find &s;ome of its mo&s;t &s;tately branches rai&s;ed from the &s;tock of hone&s;t indu&s;try.</P>

<P>He &s;eems hurt or &s;ick&mdash;his &s;ervants are wheeling him along in a chair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is only one of his mad whims. He fancies him&s;elf in a con&s;umption, and went to Li&s;bon for the recovery of his health&mdash;there he fell in love, and is now &s;earching through Spain for his mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e relations &s;uddenly conveyed her from Portugal. Di&s;appointment has increa&s;ed his nervous fancies, and with &s;tamina to la&s;t a cen|tury he believes that he &s;ha'n't exi&s;t a month. This is the one from Ireland&mdash;he is called Sir Sturdy O'Tremor.</P>

Well, on it paced for &s;ome time, as orderly and &s;lowly as if it had been in a proce&s;|&s;ion; when, unluckily, a bed of clover on the road-&s;ide tempting the &s;teeds to deviate from the beaten track, down went the carriage into an ugly kind of a hollow: I heard the &s;creams of wo|men, and flew to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Tho&s;e fellows were pa&s;&s;ing, who&s;e aid I required to rai&s;e the carriage. The beggarly ra&s;cals, con&s;idering &s;uch employment a degradation, in&s;olently refu&s;ed.

<P>Surely my ma&s;ter, Don Miguel de Lara, is the la&s;t man in the world that I &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected of accepting a po&s;t in the Holy Office. He u&s;ed to be the mo&s;t friendly, good-humoured old fellow in all Spain: what then could induce him to become an Inqui&s;itor? He is mightily altered, and yet, &s;omehow, the change is only &s;uperficial. He frowns at every body, and hardly &s;peaks a kind word; but I have rea&s;on to think his heart is as humane as ever. He has &s;ent me to &s;eek out a melancholy being who, as he under&s;tands, choo&s;es to live in this lonely place. A man can't be void of tenderne&s;s who courts the &s;ociety of the unfortunate.&mdash;This mu&s;t be the per&s;on I am &s;ent to&mdash;I'll ob&s;erve him a little, before I acco&s;t him.</P>

Can its gloomy caverns terrify the man who loaths the &s;ight of day? can eternal &s;ilence be a puni&s;h|ment to him to whom all conver&s;e with mankind is hateful? or can the flames which fold around the victim of its wrath, equal the fire which burns within my bo&s;om? No, no; the flames which kin|dle at the &s;take, po&s;&s;e&s;s the mercy too to counteract the vengeance that employs them, and &s;oon con|&s;ign the &s;ufferer to eternal peace; while here, here in this tortured heart, a fire more painful rages, and yet will not de&s;troy.</P>
