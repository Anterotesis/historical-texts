<SP>
<SPEAKER>MITHRANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Danger is ev'ry where: when cruelty</L>
<L>Extends her iron reign, we ne'er can keep</L>
<L>Too &s;trict a guard upon our &s;peech: a dream</L>
<L>May rouze the &s;lumbering fury: fell &s;u&s;picion</L>
<L>On innocence will &s;tamp the mark of guilt,</L>
<L>And tyranny a&s;&s;umes the mien of ju&s;tice</L>
<L>To puni&s;h crimes that never yet had being.</L>
<L>The genial fea&s;t, the nuptial bed, the temples</L>
<L>Are not &s;ecure from treachery.</L>

<SPEAKER>MANDANE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis true, 'tis true&mdash;O! I remember all&mdash;</L>
<L>When fir&s;t I view'd Alcaeus, how my blood</L>

<L>Wou'd'&s;t thou &s;o long conceal him from my love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MITHRANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>I fear'd to tru&s;t maternal tenderne&s;s,</L>
<L>Which wi&s;dom ill can rule; had not your &s;orrows</L>
<L>Awak'd my pity, had I not &s;u&s;pected</L>

<L>To you your &s;on had &s;till remain'd unknown.</L>

<SPEAKER>MANDANE.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet Mandane's wretched, envious fortune,</L>
<L>Spite of the &s;un&s;hine that would gild the pro&s;pect,</L>
<L>Spreads o'er my day affliction's &s;able clouds.</L>
<L>Cyrus return'd and living mu&s;t excite</L>
<L>A mother's deare&s;t tran&s;ports; but Camby&s;es</L>

<L>Alas, my father!</L>
<L>How &s;hall I run this arduous race of glory?</L>

<L>WEll, here I am&mdash;thank heaven! no more Mandane&mdash;</L>
<L>Among our&s;elves this bard is but a Zany.</L>
<L>Says I&mdash;when fir&s;t he offer'd me the part,</L>
<L>I hope'tis nature&mdash;levell'd at the heart!</L>
<L>Says he&mdash;a hu&s;band thought &s;ar off to roam,</L>
<L>Di&s;guis'd, and unexpectedly comes home.</L>
<L>A &s;on returns, lo&s;t twenty years, dy'e &s;ee,</L>
<L>To call you mother, tho' not thirty-three.</L>
<L>This (I reply'd) will do, if I can gue&s;s,</L>
<L>For this indeed is natural di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;</L>
<L>Di&s;tre&s;s! (he cry'd) you quite mi&s;take the thing;</L>
<L>A&s;tyages you'll find&mdash;had dreamt&mdash;the king&mdash;</L>
<L>I &s;top'd him &s;hort&mdash;perhaps it may be true,</L>
<L>That your old nature differs from your new.</L>
<L>From various cau&s;es equal &s;orrows flow,</L>
<L>All realms and times have &s;ome peculiar woe:</L>
<L>With us what griefs from ills dome&s;tic ri&s;e,</L>
<L>When now a beau&mdash;and now a monkey dies!</L>
<L>In this our iron age, &s;till harder lot,</L>
<L>A ma&s;querade, no ticket to be got&mdash;</L>
<L>Your ob&s;olete di&s;tre&s;s may now be told&mdash;</L>
<L>Let's &s;ee&mdash;there's ravi&s;hing&mdash;that's very old.</L>
<L>There's love that &s;corn'd a title and e&s;tate&mdash;</L>
<L>The&s;e woes of love are va&s;tly ou? of date!</L>
<L>Then there's your martyr to his country's weal&mdash;</L>
<L>What &s;trange di&s;tre&s;s the&s;e ancients us'd to &s;eel!</L>
<L>The love of country now indeed runs high;</L>
<L>They prove its value mo&s;t, who deare&s;t buy;</L>
<L>Think what our patriots pay in &s;terling gold,</L>
<L>A &s;ingle borough for &s;even years to hold.</L>
<L>Tho' here in <HI>&s;tatu quo</HI> I &s;till remain,</L>
<L>I've oft been married, ravi&s;h'd, erown'd and &s;lain!</L>
<L>None of all the&s;e have been my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to-night,</L>
<L>So us'd to fancy'd angu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">light;</L>
