<SP>
<SPEAKER>Li&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I gue&s;s who you mean, the young Marquis De Lancy, and he has pa&s;&s;ed &s;o frequently under your window within the&s;e few days, that I am amazed your guardian, with all his &s;u&s;picions, has not ob&s;erved him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has walked by above ten times within this hour, and every time with his eyes fixed up to the lattice of my window, and I had no heart to remove from it, for every time he &s;aluted me with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful bow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Li&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was his valet with him?</P>

<P>No, but I &s;aw another per&s;on in deep con|ver&s;ation with him, a &s;trange looking man, who appeared like one of the faculty, for his dre&s;s very much re&s;embled that of my guardian's.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Li&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know who it is&mdash;La Fluer, valet to the Marquis, di&s;gui&s;ed as a doctor, and I have no doubt but under that di&s;gui&s;e he will find means to intro|duce him&s;elf to your old guardian, and perhaps be brought into the very hou&s;e, and if I can a&s;&s;i&s;t his &s;cheme I will; for is it not a &s;hame the doctor &s;hould dare here in Paris to forbid both you and your &s;er|vant to &s;tir from home; lock us up, and treat us as women are treated in Spain.</P>

<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind, Li&s;ette, don't put your&s;elf in a pa&s;&s;ion, for we can learn to plot and deceive, and treat him as men are treated in Spain.</P>
