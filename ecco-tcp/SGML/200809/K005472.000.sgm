<HEAD>THE PREFATORY ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Di&s;|cour&s;es, hath been frequently ac|cu&s;ed of cheri&s;hing in his own brea&s;t, and labouring to diffu&s;e among others, a Spirit of enmity again&s;t the members of the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church. But, this accu&s;ation hath no other foundation than the ignorance, or the pa&s;&s;ions, of tho&s;e who have rai&s;ed it. He can &s;eriou&s;ly, and truly avow, that he knoweth not what it is to wi&s;h Evil to any man, that he heartily wi&s;heth well to every one in the world. Others, al&s;o, can te&s;tify for him, that, next to the love of the Su|preme Being, the adorable &s;ource of all Good; there are no doctrines which he &s;o earne&s;tly and univer&s;ally recommends, as an abhorrence of every &s;pecies of per|&s;ecution, a candid and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate tem|per of mind towards tho&s;e who differ
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
from us, and a generous, boundle&s;s, univer&s;al charity.</P>
<P>Is there, however, or, can there be, any kind of incon&s;i&s;tency between the &s;incerity of this profe&s;&s;ion, and a tho|rough di&s;like to the mode of Religion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, with warm and re|peated animadver&s;ions upon the appre|hended corruptions of it? May I not have an unque&s;tionable good will for a Pagan, while I dete&s;t Idolatry as a di&s;|grace to man, and the highe&s;t in&s;ult that can be offered again&s;t heaven? May I not be mo&s;t affectionately di&s;po&s;ed to|wards a Papi&s;t, a Mahommedan, and a Jew; while I de&s;pi&s;e Popery and Maho|medi&s;m, and would take every conve|nient opportunity of expo&s;ing them as wicked impo&s;tures, and while I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant inclination to embrace Judai&s;m? Churchmen, who, in the pa|roxi&s;ms of their zeal, mo&s;t violently de|claim again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed here&s;ies of the Di&s;&s;enters, do not therefore I would hope, hate the Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves; and there are Di&s;&s;enters, I am certain, who make no &s;cruple to charge the Church with having adopted, and &s;till maintaining, the mo&s;t childi&s;h, contra|dictory,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
uncharitable and anti-chri&s;tian doctrines, who, notwith&s;tanding, enter|tain no antipathy again&s;t any Church|man on the face of the earth, but wi&s;h well to them all, and would, upon all occa&s;ions, treat every individual of them, not only according to the laws of <HI>common civility,</HI> but al&s;o according to the &s;tricte&s;t principles of humanity and brotherly love. One of the mo&s;t benevolent of men, one who is known to cheri&s;h the mo&s;t friendly di&s;po&s;ition towards the mem|bers of the Church, as well as towards all men, has repeatedly, however, charg|ed the Church it&s;elf with the heinous and barbarous crime of Idolatry, be|&s;ides taxing it with a great variety of other follies, and ab&s;urdities. Nor can I, after revolving again and again the matter in my own mind, &s;ee the lea&s;t rea&s;on why the mo&s;t rigid Churchman &s;hould take umbrage either at the bold|ne&s;s, or &s;everity, of this charge. If it be groundle&s;s, it reflects di&s;honour only upon the Author, and is mo&s;t ea&s;ily re|futed. If, on the contrary, it be well founded, we &s;hould not degrade our&s;elves by traducing the very fir&s;t genius of the age, nor think that by vilifying him, we
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
change the nature of things, but &s;hould acknowledge that he de&s;erves the &s;incere thanks of mankind, for his hone&s;t en|deavours to enlighten, reform, and re|claim them to the pure wor&s;hip of the only Living and True God. Let the matter then be coolly and fairly de|bated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The friends of Orthodoxy have been repeatedly invited to point out the errors of this Arch-heretic. They have been particularly called upon to enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the doctrine now under con&s;ideration. But, they have all ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence, except one, who indeed cannot fairly rank among them, though he entered the li&s;ts as their champion. This gentleman, however, has &s;ince acknowledged him&s;elf mi&s;taken. If there are other more penetrating ge|niu&s;es, who, as I have heard &s;ome of them pretend, can &s;till demon&s;trate our obligations to join in the Athana&s;ian Wor&s;hip, why are they backward in exe|cuting &s;o good a work? Why are they not &s;o chari|tably di&s;po&s;ed, as to conde&s;cend to inform the more ig|norant? Or, if they find them&s;elves unequal to the ta&s;k, why do they not renounce their claim to infal|libility, and give up their favourite idol as indefen|&s;ible?</NOTE>. But, let tho&s;e champions who would refute the charge, and lead Dr. Prie&s;tley to the knowledge of the truth, be cautioned, not to take refuge in Church Authority, nor to divert our attention from the point in que&s;tion, by referring us to the opinions of Fathers, or Coun|cils,

This pa&s;&s;age, however, is at pre&s;ent co|vered with &s;uch confu&s;ion and darkne&s;s, in the view of the <HI>unregenerate,</HI> that it &s;eems neither above the dig|nity, nor below the humility of a Metropolitan to en|deavour to explain it. As the greate&s;t men &s;hould not wi&s;h to have their good evil-&s;poken of, and as tho&s;e who we are told have both <HI>received the Holy Gho&s;t them|&s;elves,</HI> and have <HI>the power al&s;o of conferring it upon others,</HI> can certainly, if our information be true, enable us to comprehend every thing that is agreeable to the word of truth, they &s;hould conde&s;cend to open the blind eyes, was it only to prevent the &s;trange ideas which &s;ome may otherwi&s;e entertain of the Faith of Bi&s;hops. Until we are thus enlightened, a man who rather means to pity than in&s;ult them, may be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay that they have no certain object of religious wor&s;hip, or that they wor|&s;hip they know not what. Here, in particular it might be &s;aid, they fir&s;t &s;eem to believe, that there is One God, and Father of all, who is both able and willing to &s;ave; but, that they have no &s;ooner addre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to him, than they &s;eem to di&s;tru&s;t either his power, or his mercy, and that they therefore addre&s;s them&s;elves to the Son, as if he only could or would have any compa&s;&s;ion on them; but that, again, having done this, they &s;eem in&s;tantly to lo&s;e all confidence, both in the Father and in the Son, and apply them|&s;elves, therefore, to the Holy Gho&s;t as their only God. The ob&s;erver might continue to remark, that when they had proceeded thus far in their wor&s;hip, they ap|peared to be all confu&s;ion again, and that not knowing whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Gho&s;t was the True God, they called upon them all toge|ther, not to mi&s;s the right object, and, in their ex|treme precipitation, de&s;cribed the One God as con&s;i&s;ting of three Per&s;ons. Then follows, it might be added, a &s;trange kind of incantation, as it would &s;eem, to the Three Per&s;ons, comprehended under the term <HI>Lord,</HI> which mu&s;t &s;hock &s;uch as are not initiated into <HI>the my&s;|teries,</HI> as it leads them to apprehend that the Athana|&s;ians believe their God to have been a mortal man, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>

<P>Be&s;ides, it is well known that the clergy of the E&s;tabli&s;hment take frequent op|portunities of vindicating <HI>their</HI> principles, and of extolling <HI>their</HI> &s;ervice, as the mo&s;t pure and perfect &s;y&s;tem of religious wor|&s;hip under heaven, as, if not in&s;pired and infallible, approaching at lea&s;t as near to divine perfection as human abilities could po&s;&s;ibly carry it. Nay, &s;ome of them, on one particular day of the year, not only take occa&s;ion to revile the principles of all Di&s;&s;enters, but all Di&s;&s;enters them|&s;elves; without making any kind of apo|logy for their conduct, without &s;uppo&s;ing, indeed, that any is nece&s;&s;ary, without ima|gining that they give ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to any one Di&s;&s;enter, but rather that they merit the thanks of them all. Why may not a Di&s;&s;enter, then, freely propo&s;e and 
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
vindicate, his own principles to Di&s;&s;enters? Why may not a Di&s;&s;enter, without har|bouring a particle of enmity again&s;t any man in the world, declare, avow, and pub|li&s;h, what he apprehends to be the doc|trines of Rea&s;on and Truth? Why may not a Di&s;&s;enter, while all the arguments that have been hitherto advanced in fa|vour of E&s;tabli&s;hments are in&s;ufficient to work a conviction on his mind, &s;incerely recommend, as well as practi&s;e, what he believes to be built upon the foundation of the prophets and apo&s;tles, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the Chief Corner Stone? Who is there indeed, has the lea&s;t right to take offence, at the undi&s;gui&s;ed decla|rations of an hone&s;t man, who has truth alone for his object, and who recommends what he believes to be truth, not with the view of in&s;ulting any individual, but only in the di&s;charge of what he thinks his duty? Be&s;ides, &s;hould he be ima|gined to labour under a very di&s;cernible weakne&s;s of intellect, to have formed a wrong judgment, to be bewildered with inveterate prejudices, and to have en|tirely mi&s;taken the grand plan of the Go&s;pel, by what other method, but openly communicating his &s;entiments to others,
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
could he &s;tand any fair chance, to have his under&s;tanding &s;trengthened, his erro|neous opinions corrected, the thick dark|ne&s;s which envelops him di&s;per&s;ed, and his rea&s;on fully enlightened?</P>
<P>I am certain, that I am neither know|ingly nor willingly deceived; and that I would readily exchange my pre&s;ent &s;enti|ments, for any others that could be &s;hewn to have even the probability of being bet|ter founded. But, notwith&s;tanding this, I can embrace nothing as Truth, which does not appear &s;uch to me. If &s;till, how|ever, I am not able to di&s;cover or com|prehend Truth, I can neither help my want of capacity, nor ju&s;tly incur any blame for it. Tho&s;e, indeed, who would condemn me in this ca&s;e, might as rea|&s;onably condemn me for being either tal|ler or &s;horter than them&s;elves, or for not being exactly &s;imilar to them in features or complexion. In &s;hort, I think any kind of apology for the following work, &s;o far as the matter of di&s;cour&s;e may be in&s;inuated to require one, mu&s;t be already anticipated by every candid mind, or by every per&s;on who would deal with others as he wi&s;hes to be treated him&s;elf. But, to tho&s;e who are yet di&s;po&s;ed to think

otherwi&s;e, I will frankly declare, in the words of an Author, whom I love to read, and whom I love to think of, that, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The things, that &s;eem to want an apo|logy, are the doctrines of Original Sin, Prede&s;tination, Trinity in Unity, Satis|faction by vicarious puni&s;hments, &amp;c. a Hierarchy, con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons, with names and powers altogether unknown in the New Te&s;tament: Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, as &s;uch, inve&s;ted with Civil Power, contrary to the very genius of the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e king|dom was not of this world; Sub&s;crip|tions to Creeds, and Articles of Faith of human compo&s;ition; the impo&s;ition of ceremonies, by the authority of men in a Church, of which Chri&s;t alone is the Head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such a church, I know, is a&s;&s;erted to be the Church of Chri&s;t.

<P>Yet, on another account, I confe&s;s, &s;ome apology may be nece&s;&s;ary.

My great remaining difficulty is, that the very per&s;ons, who expre&s;&s;ed &s;o warm an indignation at the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, ac|knowledged, at the &s;ame time, as I am informed, that every a&s;&s;ertion contained in them was true.

<P>THE Go&s;pel precepts are remarka|ble, in general, for their &s;implicity. They come not recommended to us by the borrowed charms of eloquence, or by any of the embelli&s;hments of art, but, by what is of much greater importance, their own intrin&s;ic excellence; and, as we would naturally expect, that the Great Governor of the world, when he conde&s;cendeth to reveal him&s;elf to man, would not &s;uffer things of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to be involved in ob&s;curity; we find accor|dingly,
<PB N="2" REF="23">
that the more important any doctrine is, the more intelligible are the terms in which it is univer&s;ally ex|pre&s;&s;ed. The way of duty, the way to happine&s;s, is always pointed out in &s;uch legible characters, that he that runs may read. That allegiance al&s;o, which is required in &s;piritual things, is unfold|ed to us in the plaine&s;t language. But, to our great a&s;toni&s;hment, tho&s;e very doc|trines, in which &s;ophi&s;try it&s;elf can di&s;|cover no ambiguity, have been the mo&s;t gro&s;ly perverted, the mo&s;t pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and impiou&s;ly oppo&s;ed. But, without &s;earching the ample page of hi&s;tory for a variety of particulars in proof of this; &s;uch reflections, as offer them&s;elves to our con&s;ideration from the words of the text, will be abundantly &s;ufficient to our pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>As an introduction to what I propo&s;e, it will be proper, fir&s;t of all to ob&s;erve, that the whole chapter abounds with &s;ome &s;ingularly affecting animadver&s;ions, which our Lord had made upon the &s;uper&s;tition, hypocri&s;y, and other vices of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees. He gives us a &s;ummary view of their inju&s;tice, cruelty, oppre&s;|&s;ion, and uncharitablene&s;s; and &s;tripping
<PB N="3" REF="24">
them of all their artificial &s;anctity, de|lineates their true characters in the mo&s;t lively and expre&s;&s;ive colours. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'They im|po&s;ed,'</Q> he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'heavy burthens upon others, by which they would not be bound them&s;elves. They pretended to be the mo&s;t &s;trictly ju&s;t and pious of men, at the &s;ame time that they de|voured widows hou&s;es: and, while they were &s;o punctiliou&s;ly exact in their at|tention to what was then a branch of the externals of religion, as to tithe &s;uch things, as mint, ani&s;e, and cum|min, they &s;candalou&s;ly neglected tho&s;e weightier matters of the law, ju&s;tice, mercy, and faith.'</Q></P>
<P>But, be&s;ides a variety of other crimes, to which they were notoriou&s;ly addicted, they compleated their infamy, by exer|ci&s;ing an impious dominion over the con|&s;ciences of others. They claimed the power of pre&s;cribing certain <HI>ceremonies;</HI> and &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven a|gain&s;t all opponents. With all the gri|mace of an affected &s;uperlative holine&s;s, they compa&s;&s;ed &s;ea and land, to make one pro&s;elyte, when in their own hearts, there was nothing but ravening and wicked|ne&s;s. In &s;hort, they laid a much greater
<PB N="4" REF="25">
&s;tre&s;s upon a devout attention to in&s;igni|ficant forms, than in living up to the perfect rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth; and, as our Lord expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'They &s;trained at a gnat, and &s;wallowed a camel.'</Q></P>
<P>It might be well expected, then, that a teacher &s;ent from God, would mo&s;t cautiou&s;ly guard his Di&s;ciples again&s;t &s;uch enormous corruptions; and that he would charge them, with a peculiar earne&s;t|ne&s;s, not to a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e over-bearing principles of pride and &s;uperiority which actuated their enemies, nor to form the mo&s;t di&s;tant intention of founding a &s;y&s;tem of religious ari&s;tocracy over one another. This had been the very foun|tain of all tho&s;e iniquities, which filled his pure mind with the utmo&s;t indigna|tion and abhorrence. He, accordingly, thus &s;olemnly addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to tho&s;e <HI>whom he had cho&s;en out of the world,</HI> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Be not ye called Rabbi, that is, Doctors, or &s;piritual guides; for one is your Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t, and all ye are brethren:'</Q> that is, all children of the &s;ame common, univer&s;al Father, and all, therefore, in religious matters, inve&s;ted with exactly the &s;ame authority and

power. He could not have more fully expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, if he had &s;aid, I only am the way, the truth, and the life; tho&s;e doctrines, which I have received of my Father, are henceforth to be ac|counted the only true &s;tandard of faith, and practice; by tho&s;e, therefore, you &s;hould be governed here, becau&s;e by tho&s;e alone you &s;hall be judged hereafter.</P>
<P>Had all tho&s;e, who have ever &s;ince profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves the followers of Je&s;us, ob&s;erved a due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the&s;e divine admonitions, we might now fami|liarize to our minds the various and com|plicated tran&s;actions of former times, with perpetually encrea&s;ing plea&s;ure and delight; we might be able to read the hi&s;tories of a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pa&s;t ages, without that degree of over-whelming horror which unavoidably ri&s;es in the &s;oul, at the view of that violence and barbarity which have been exerci&s;ed up|on the &s;aints of the earth, who have been cru&s;aded, ma&s;&s;acred, burnt, and torn in pieces, and that by tho&s;e who have im|piou&s;ly named the name of Chri&s;t, for no other cau&s;e whatever, than their hone&s;tly maintaining an inviolable alle|giance to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="27">
But we all know, that this Anti-chri&s;tian, and diabolical &s;pirit, which formerly prevailed among the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, was next adopted, in all it's aggravating circum&s;tances, by that <HI>mother of harlots and abominations of the earth,</HI> the church of Rome: and, we know the horrible, and unparrallelled inhumanities of this church, what fires &s;he hath kindled, what rivers of blood &s;he hath &s;hed, what cities and towns &s;he hath laid in ruins, what exten&s;ive provinces &s;he hath de&s;olated, and what thou&s;ands of innocent victims &s;he hath butchered, in order to &s;upport the&s;e helli&s;h claims. But, happy would it be for the world, un&s;peakably happy, if we could name no other church which hath been partaker of her &s;ins. Happy would it be for the world, if the mon&s;ter of which we are here &s;peaking, was not &s;till living, be|yond the boundaries of the Papal Em|pire, and bla&s;ting the fair fruits of the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, among tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Prote&s;tants. Happy would it be for us, if even in this enlightened land, there was now only one Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t. But, whatever pain and a&s;toni&s;hment we mu&s;t feel at the recital,
<PB N="7" REF="28">
truth compels us to declare, that, where|ever there is any Human Creed e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, there, there are more Ma&s;ters than One; there, there is an Authority dia|metrically oppo&s;ite to the Authority of Chri&s;t, and fundamentally &s;ubver&s;ive of it. This I propo&s;e to illu&s;trate in the following Di&s;cour&s;es. It is evident, I think, indeed, from the words of the text then&s;elves. For, when our Lord &s;ays, <HI>One is your Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t;</HI> he means as much as if he had affirmed, You have no &s;piritual juri&s;diction at all one over the other;&mdash;Churches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author refers to &s;uch con&s;titutions, as have been &s;ince called churches.</NOTE> are not your Ma&s;ter; mitred prie&s;ts, or gho&s;tly fathers are not your Ma&s;ter; Chri&s;t a|lone is your Ma&s;ter; and his laws are to be learned only from his own mouth, without the intervention of any human Authority whatever.</P>
<P>But, now, to e&s;tabli&s;h this doctrine upon the very be&s;t foundation, I &s;hall en|deavour to &s;hew, in the fir&s;t place, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t had the unque&s;tionable au|thority of heaven for a&s;&s;uming that di&s;tin|gui&s;hing preheminence, which he here
<PB N="8" REF="29">
claimed, namely, that of being our only infallible teacher of Religion, as the word <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> in this place, &s;ignifies; and, hence, it will be ea&s;y to &s;hew the incon|&s;i&s;tency, ab&s;urdity, and impiety, of tho&s;e, who, by naming the name of Chri&s;t, mo&s;t &s;olemnly admit this doctrine, and yet, in every in&s;tance of their conduct, and with a &s;hamele&s;s effrontery, act re|pugnant to it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That Je&s;us Chri&s;t had the un|que&s;tionable authority of heaven, for a&s;&s;uming that di&s;tingui&s;hing prehemi|nence which he here claimed, namely, that of being our only infallible teacher of Religion.'</Q> It is, undoubtedly, the &s;ole prerogative of the eternal Jehovah, to give laws to man. It is his preroga|tive, likewi&s;e, to communicate the&s;e laws, at what time, in what manner, by what &s;anctions, and by what me&s;&s;engers he plea&s;es; and, whenever, or by whomever, his wi&s;dom determines, either to re-pub|li&s;h and enlarge old laws, or to reveal new laws, it is our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to obey. But, then, we are not to receive, as Divine Laws, all doctrines, that are re|commended to us as &s;uch. For, this
<PB N="9" REF="30">
would expo&s;e us to the mo&s;t palpable con|tradictions, and to millions of impo&s;i|tions. On the contrary, becau&s;e we are required to &s;ubmit to the Divine Authori|ty only, we &s;hould fir&s;t be a&s;&s;ured, be|fore we receive any doctrine, that it is Divine; and, this we can only know, by bringing the &s;aid doctrine before the high tribunal of Rea&s;on. Rea&s;on, is unque&s;|tionably a Divine Law, written with in|delible characters upon every human heart; and, as the peerle&s;s perfections of Al|mighty God will not admit even the thought, that he can contradict him&s;elf, or that he can give us contradictory laws; we may, therefore, conclude that no laws can be Divine, which are a contradiction to our Rea&s;on, or which are plainly re|pugnant to that &s;en&s;e of Right and Wrong which is implanted in the &s;oul, and which is another Divine Law. But, if, on the contrary, any doctrines that are recom|mended to us as Divine, be found to cor|re&s;pond with the congenial &s;entiments of our minds, and with the demon&s;trable perfections of God in the univer&s;e around us, and are moreover confirmed by the mo&s;t inconte&s;table evidences of the Divine Power; then, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that
<PB N="10" REF="31">
the&s;e doctrines de&s;cended from above, from the Father of lights, and that the teacher of the&s;e doctrines, is the Sent of God.</P>
<P>Hence, then, it will clearly appear, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the anointed Me&s;|&s;enger of God, and fully commi&s;&s;ioned, by him, to point out the way of Salva|tion to man. For, he taught us no doc|trines that are contrary to our Rea&s;on, but &s;uch as rather illuminate and perfect our Rea&s;on in the highe&s;t degree; and, he e&s;tabli&s;hed the&s;e very doctrines, not, as ignorance or malice have fal&s;ely a&s;&s;erted, by attempting to extingui&s;h the light of Rea&s;on within us, but by the mo&s;t &s;olemn appeals to this primary law of God to man. What a wonderful contra&s;t do we di&s;cover between him, and all his pre|tended delegates, or vice-gerents and co|adjutors upon earth! How proud are they? How humble was he! Without profe&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t portion of his &s;pirit, they have lorded it over God's heritage with a rod of iron. But, he, tho' the way to truth, and the life, tho' he &s;poke as never man &s;poke, and tho' God was always with him, and always taught him, did not yet require an implicit faith from any of his followers. He knew, on the
<PB N="11" REF="32">
contrary, that one Divine Law, is be&s;t enforced and recommended by another Divine Law; and he, therefore, &s;ubmit|ted all his claims to the deci&s;ions of Rea|&s;on. He drew up no inexplicable &s;y&s;tems of faith, for us to &s;ub&s;cribe, or to ac|quie&s;ce in, in the room of works. The point that he laboured was to make men good, and not what the fa&s;hion of the times had received as orthodox. In &s;hort, he never addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Jews, in the imperative tone of modern prie&s;ts: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Swallow down this my&s;tery, and the other my&s;tery; believe, tho' your own Rea&s;on demon&s;trates the contrary, that Three are no more than One, and that One is as many as Three, el&s;e you &s;hall have no peace in the other world, and I will give you as much trouble as I can in this.'</Q> No; he challenged them to examine his own preten&s;ions, according to tho&s;e very Scriptures in which they them&s;elves believed. <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>for they be they that te&s;tify of me.</HI> He challenged them to accu&s;e him, if they could, of any &s;ingle tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Divine Laws. <HI>Which of you convinceth me of &s;in?</HI> He challenged them to convict him of any fal&s;hood, or to fix upon him
<PB N="12" REF="33">
any expre&s;&s;ions, or declarations, that were contrary to the mo&s;t indubitable perfec|tions of God. <HI>And, if I &s;ay the truth, why do ye not believe me?</HI> He challenged them to &s;hew, that any one of his mi|racles could be effected by any other Power than that of Omnipotence. <HI>And, if I do not the works of my Father, believe me not:</HI> And, he challenged them to produce any arguments, why God would be with him in all that he did, if he had not come to do the will of God, and had not received his commi&s;&s;ion immediately from God. <HI>The works which I do, in my Father's name, bear witne&s;s of me.

But, if I by the Spirit of God, overwhelm the works of darkne&s;s, then is the kingdom of God come unto you.</HI></P>
<P>All this, we mu&s;t &s;ee, was &s;ound rea|&s;oning, and demon&s;trably proved, that Je|&s;us was the Son of God with power, that he came not of him&s;elf, that he &s;poke not of him&s;elf, that he did nothing of him|&s;elf, but that whatever he did was by the power of the Highe&s;t. His holine&s;s, his wi&s;dom, his humility, his &s;elf-denial, and his innumerable a&s;toni&s;hing miracles, did
<PB N="13" REF="34">
all proclaim him to be the well-beloved of the Father, full of grace and truth: and, the importance of his doctrines, and the benevolent &s;cheme which he came to propo&s;e to the &s;ouls of men, call up our mo&s;t earne&s;t attention to all that he did, and taught, and &s;uffered for us.</P>
<P>He was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, and &s;eparate from &s;inners; the &s;potle&s;s lamb of God, without blemi&s;h, without guile, without a &s;ingle deflection from the ways of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth. All this, was fully characteri&s;tic of his heavenly origin. It is &s;uch a one as he, whom we would naturally expect the Holy Maje&s;ty of the Univer&s;e, and the Father of all mercies, to &s;end into the world; one, who could no more betray us, by his example, than by his precepts; one, who was as amia|ble and lovely in his life, as in his doc|trines; one, in whom virtue might be &s;een breathing cele&s;tial &s;weetne&s;s; di&s;play|ing a thou&s;and thou&s;and inexpre&s;&s;ibly ve|nerable charms, adorned with every grace, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every excellence and beauty, and &s;uperior in glory to the &s;plendor of the &s;un, and the brightne&s;s of the firma|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="35">
But, the Wi&s;dom of Je&s;us, is another demon&s;trable proof of his divine mi&s;&s;ion. The people might well be a&s;toni&s;hed at his doctrines; for they were &s;uch as never had been taught before, &s;uch as infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the &s;y&s;tems of the antient &s;ages. He carried morality to its highe&s;t purity and perfection; nothing now can be added to what he has &s;aid upon it; and, after a trial of above &s;eventeen hun|dred years, no exception can yet be made to a &s;ingle precept he has given. Be|&s;ides, he alone hath repre&s;ented to us the perfections of the True God, in their native dignity and glory; leading us to con&s;ider Him, as the One Spirit, and Univer&s;al Father, the only Omnipotent, the only Author of every good, who&s;e Providence continually watcheth over the minute&s;t works of his hands; and, he being the be&s;t judge of human nature, that ever appeared in our world, both, in delivering tho&s;e &s;ublime and unparrellelled doctrines, univer&s;ally, and with an a&s;to|ni&s;hing exactne&s;s, adapted his addre&s;s to the various characters of his audience; frequently drawing them to condemn their impious conduct, according to their own principles; and, afterwards, with irre&s;i&s;t|ible
<PB N="15" REF="36">
force, in extempore parables, a|bounding with innumerable beauties, and &s;uch as have never been equalled by any other &s;on of man; beating down all the &s;trong holds of iniquity that &s;tood before him, and maje&s;tically &s;cattering the whole immen&s;e ma&s;s of darkne&s;s which covered the world. Now, upon what other con|ceivable foundation is &s;uch wi&s;dom to be accounted for, than by allowing him to have been a Divine Me&s;&s;enger? How is it po&s;&s;ible to be accounted for, that the re|puted &s;on of a poor carpenter, untrained in the &s;chools, without any of the aids of philo&s;ophy, &s;hould have been the wi&s;e&s;t of men, and the only infallible teacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth, un|le&s;s he was taught of God, and &s;ent by him, to be the light of men? Could he, without either any divine or human aids, have been &s;o &s;ingularly happy, as to have infinitely eclip&s;ed in knowledge all the men who lived before and after him? Or would the God of all wi&s;dom and grace, have given <HI>him only</HI> an under&s;tand|ing to know the things that are excellent, had not he been under the con&s;tant in|fluence of his good will and plea&s;ure?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="37">
But, the humility and &s;elf-denial of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, likewi&s;e demon&s;trably prove him, to have been our heavenly appointed Ma&s;ter, or Teacher. Had he come to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome favourite &s;cheme of his own, he would certainly have aimed at as much power and authority as he could prudently a&s;&s;ume. He would have availed him&s;elf of the friend&s;hip of this world; and would have let no fair opportunity e&s;cape of fanning the fire of popular prejudices in his favour. But, he was meek and lowly of heart, and came not to be mini&s;tred unto, but to mini&s;ter. He &s;ought not honour from men, but that which cometh from God only. In&s;tead of aiming at temporal do|minions, gra&s;ping at the &s;ceptre of uni|ver&s;al empire, or climbing the &s;ummit of tran&s;ient greatne&s;s, he chearfully offered him&s;elf to be the &s;ervant of all. He de|clared, in the mo&s;t unequivocal lan|guage, that his kingdom was not of this world; and, that if we would &s;tand can|didates for his favour, or finally enter into the joy of our Lord, we mu&s;t deny our&s;elves, and take up our cro&s;s daily, to follow him; and, he died as he lived, gloriou&s;ly avowing the &s;ame &s;entiments,

maintaining the &s;ame dignity, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame contempt for all earthly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, di&s;covering the &s;ame generous benevolence to man, and repo&s;ing the &s;ame unlimited confidence in his God and Father.</P>
<P>Now, could all this have po&s;&s;ibly hap|pened, unle&s;s God had &s;ent him? Did any per&s;on ever yet e&s;pou&s;e a cau&s;e, that pro|mi&s;ed, and aimed at nothing, but po|verty, contempt, and &s;ufferings, and die in the &s;ame without reluctance, unle&s;s he had full evidence, clear and irre&s;i&s;tible evidence, that this cau&s;e was the cau&s;e of God? The &s;uppo&s;ition is ridiculous, and a contradiction to it&s;elf. This argument alone, therefore, &s;ufficiently proves, that Je&s;us had his authority from above; that the God of all wi&s;dom in&s;pired and taught him; and that he was divinely appointed to be our Ma&s;ter in Religion.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the holine&s;s, the wi&s;dom, the humility, and &s;elf-denial of our Lord; God al&s;o bore witne&s;s to him, by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive train of the mo&s;t &s;tupendous mi|racles; miracles which mere human art or power can no more accompli&s;h, than we can arre&s;t the &s;un in its cour&s;e, or create another &s;un or another world.

death and the grave, and of an unfading future and eternal crown of glory; the&s;e wonderful communications of his love, were accompanied with the &s;olid encou|ragements to ca&s;t all our cares and bur|thens upon God, and to cry unto him in all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, as our ever-pre&s;ent pro|tector and friend; and the&s;e were likewi&s;e accompanied with the ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;urances, that God will not &s;uffer us to be tempted above what we are able, that he will ne|ver leave us nor for&s;ake us while we per|&s;evere in our duty, and that he will make all things work together for good to them that love him.

<P>I HAVE endeavoured to &s;hew, in the preceding Di&s;cour&s;e, that our Lord had the unque&s;tionable authority of hea|ven for claiming that high and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing preheminence which he here a&s;&s;umes, namely, that of being our one Ma&s;ter, or only infallible teacher of Re|ligion. This appears, I ob&s;erved, from all tho&s;e mo&s;t illu&s;trious virtues and hea|venly graces, which compo&s;ed his charac|ter; from that &s;ublime, and unparallelled knowledge which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and from
<PB N="30" REF="51">
that Divine Power which univer&s;ally up|held, and bore witne&s;s of him. His holine&s;s, his wi&s;dom, his humility, his &s;elf-denial, and tho&s;e innumerable and a&s;toni&s;hing miracles which he performed thro' the power of the Highe&s;t; toge|ther with the purity, benevolence, per|fection, and importance of the doctrines which he taught, all demon&s;trably evince, that he was the well-beloved of the Father, the cho&s;en me&s;&s;enger of his &s;al|vation, full of grace and truth.</P>
<P>Hence, I ob&s;erved, as the clear con|&s;equence of this doctrine, that it is our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to &s;ubmit to his au|thority, and to pay the &s;ame deference and obedience to all his laws, as if they were now immediately proclaimed to us from the lofty throne of God.</P>
<P>But our duty being once obviou&s;ly pointed out, it then becomes a matter of the greater importance. I &s;hall there|fore as was propo&s;ed, in the next place, enquire at pre&s;ent, what is the full ex|tent of this duty, or what is particularly implied in acknowledging Chri&s;t to be our one Ma&s;ter, and &s;ubmitting to him as &s;uch; and, this evidently implies no le&s;s, than that we &s;hould acknowledge no
<PB N="31" REF="52">
other man, or body of men whatever, con&s;idered either as in competition with him, or in conjunction with him, to be our Ma&s;ter. The <HI>one Ma&s;ter</HI> &s;ignifies the one only Ma&s;ter. We accordingly find, that he had all authority committed to him by the Father, and that he is con|&s;tituted the only Lawgiver and King in his Church; and, from this, it incon|trovertibly follows, that we, as the true &s;ubjects of his kingdom, mu&s;t, in a re|ligious capacity, &s;ubmit to his Laws on|ly. The&s;e laws, it is again obvious to ob&s;erve, are to be found in the Go&s;pel only. For this &s;acred volume contains the whole doctrine of Chri&s;t, which was either taught by him&s;elf in per&s;on, or by his apo&s;tles, whom, after him, he com|mi&s;&s;ioned to preach his name among all nations. <HI>Thou &s;halt not dimini&s;h aught from it; neither &s;hall any thing be added to it.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, then, we learn, in the fir&s;t place, that every law of the Go&s;pel de|mands our full acquie&s;cence and obedi|ence; but that every law, on the con|trary, that is formed in oppo&s;ition to the Go&s;pel, is a daring encroachment upon our native rights, a traiterous impo&s;ition
<PB N="32" REF="53">
upon our under&s;tandings, and an im|pious rebellion again&s;t God him&s;elf, be|cau&s;e a rebellion again&s;t the one Ma&s;ter, whom he has appointed.</P>
<P>Should any &s;y&s;tem, or doctrine, there|fore, by the wife and the learned, be now propo&s;ed to us as a rule of faith, our fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is to enquire, whether this be the religion of Chri&s;t? If this be affirmed, we would then a&s;k, whether the thing propo&s;ed be the Go&s;pel it&s;elf? If this be denied, on the contrary, we would &s;ay, that <HI>we have only one Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t.</HI> But, if we are again told, that, <HI>what is propo&s;ed is a true &s;ummary of the Go&s;pel;</HI> we would, in this ca&s;e, reply, that the Go&s;pel is its own be&s;t &s;ummary, that we have nothing to do with any other; that Chri&s;t has expre&s;&s;ly taught us to <HI>&s;earch the Scriptures,</HI> but never taught us, to take up with any pretend|ed &s;ummary of them. But &s;hould it farther be in&s;i&s;ted on, that <HI>the thing pro|po&s;ed is the doctrine of the True Church;</HI> we would then a&s;k, of what true church? Should it be an&s;wered, <HI>of the true chri&s;tian church;</HI> we would &s;ay, that the true chri&s;tian church has no rule of faith, but the naked Go&s;pel. Should we, how|ever
<PB N="33" REF="54">
be &s;till told, <HI>of the true chri&s;tian church, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by human laws;</HI> to this we would give in our te&s;timony, that Chri&s;t's kingdom is not of this world, that he hath appointed no Sub-governors in his church, and that when one is of Paul, and one of Apollos, and one of Cephas, all the&s;e have &s;o far with|drawn them&s;elves from the church of Chri&s;t. But, if it &s;hould be &s;aid, in the la&s;t place, that we are incompetent judges of the Scriptures, that the bu&s;y part of mankind have not time to &s;tudy them, nor capacities to under&s;tand them, and that, therefore, for the prevention of here&s;y, there are certain <HI>holy</HI> officers ap|pointed in God's church, and purpo&s;ely <HI>trained up</HI> at the foot of the <HI>altar,</HI> and &s;olemnly CALLED and <HI>con&s;ecrated</HI> to de|liver to us the <HI>true</HI> &s;en&s;e of Scripture: all this, I would po&s;itively deny. Or, willing to do &s;omething more than offer what may be called a bold a&s;&s;ertion, I would argue in this manner; if there be, as is here pretended, any officers appointed in God's Church to deliver to us the true &s;en&s;e of Scripture, let them produce their credentials, before they authoritatively re|quire us to abide by their deci&s;ions. God
<PB N="34" REF="55">
can certainly bear witne&s;s of him&s;elf: and, if he has &s;ent the&s;e men, it may be expected that he will work miracles by them.

<P>Be&s;ides, the pretence it&s;elf, that we are incompetent judges of the Scriptures, at lea&s;t &s;o far as our &s;alvation is concerned in the under&s;tanding them, is ab&s;olutely without proof, not being warranted, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, either by Chri&s;t, or by any of his apo&s;tles.

<P><PB N="52" REF="73">
Upon the whole, I may now, I think, fairly conclude, that the mo&s;t di&s;tant at|tempt to introduce any kind of human authority in matters of faith, is a mo&s;t abominable de&s;poti&s;m, repugnant to the very nature of religion it&s;elf, to the ge|nius and groundwork of the chri&s;tian re|ligion, to the dignity of rea&s;on, to the genuine principles of freedom, to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of humanity, to the common Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, and to our avowed prin|ciples as Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters. If, there|fore, we have only One Ma&s;ter, away with all other Ma&s;ters; let none other, however famous for wi&s;dom, or rendered con&s;picuous by &s;ounding titles of honour, have the dominion over us; and, what &s;hould particularly and mo&s;t powerfully induce us to regard the exhortation, is, that the more we examine the &s;everal &s;y&s;|tems that have been e&s;pou&s;ed by that au|thority which we oppo&s;e, the more &s;hall we find them all to have been of a piece with that authority it&s;elf. Whether we take up the Popi&s;h Manual, the Engli&s;h Thirty-nine Articles and Common Prayer, the Scotch Directory, the Aug&s;bourg Con|fe&s;&s;ion, the articles of Lutherani&s;m, or the In&s;titutions of Calvin, we &s;hall find in
<PB N="53" REF="74">
them all &s;ome things that are equally ir|rational, impious and antichri&s;tian. It can, therefore, be nothing le&s;s than down|right tyranny and bla&s;phemy, which e&s;ta|bli&s;h any &s;uch authority, or which con|tinue to &s;upport it; and it can be nothing le&s;s than &s;lavery and darkne&s;s which pay any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch authority. But if there be tho&s;e, after all, who &s;till determine to &s;ubmit to human autho|rity, we pretend not to be their judges. They are amenable to a future tribunal: and, according to their actions, according to the &s;incerity and diligence they u&s;ed in improving the talents committed to their tru&s;t, they &s;hall find their &s;entence. Yet I cannot help ob&s;erving, that, until they change their pre&s;ent conduct, they &s;hould, to maintain a con&s;i&s;tent character, re|nounce the principles of Rea&s;on, reject the name of Prote&s;tants, and di&s;claim all the priveleges of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Let us, however, as members of a king|dom not of this world, re&s;olve to reject all tho&s;e doctrines of men, which tend to make void the doctrines of God. Let us firmly and deliberately re&s;olve to &s;ubmit only to our One Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t. But, as he was divinely authori&s;ed to communicate to
<PB N="54" REF="75">
us the whole will of God, and nothing but the pure will of God, let us be per&s;uaded to attend to all his in&s;tructions as we re|gard our own Salvation. Let us, when|ever we open the &s;acred Volume, to be taught of him, con&s;ider our&s;elves as un|der the direction of God him&s;elf, becau&s;e he was taught of God; and let us, whenever his animating di&s;cour&s;es are read to us out of this Volume, hearken with that reverence which is due to the wi&s;dom of God. Again, let us con&s;ider, that mere knowledge only puffeth up. Let us, therefore, while we are earne&s;tly endea|vouring to trea&s;ure up the doctrines of Chri&s;t, endeavour al&s;o, in our conduct, &s;o to make our light &s;hine among&s;t men, that others &s;eeing our good works, may be hence led, with us, to glorify our Father who is in Heaven.</P>
<P>The grand point is this. We &s;hould &s;et our affections upon the things that are above. Seeing that we look forward to a future incorruptible inheritance, this in|heritance &s;hould ever be our jewel of great price. We &s;hould con&s;ider in the &s;ame view, as the pa&s;&s;ing vapours, all the riches, and honours, and plea&s;ures, of this pre&s;ent tran&s;ient &s;cene. We &s;hould
<PB N="55" REF="76">
account nothing honourable, which does not re&s;pect the will of the Supreme Law|giver. We &s;hould e&s;teem nothing great or good, which is not a re&s;emblance of his mo&s;t glorious perfections. We &s;hould be endowed, therefore, with bowels of the mo&s;t tender mercies to our fellow men. We &s;hould be &s;trangers to all wrath, and malice, and envy, and evil-&s;peaking, and e&s;pecially to all cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion, and revenge. We &s;hould love, as brethren, the whole human race; remembring that GOD IS LOVE, and that in this was the love of God manife&s;ted, that he gave us his Only-begotten, or his well-be|loved Son, that whoever believeth in him might not peri&s;h, but have Everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>The mention of <HI>this life,</HI> is &s;ufficient to make us SHEW OURSELVES MEN. With &s;uch an object in view, we can pronounce nothing very grievous that may befal us here. With &s;uch an object in view, though all the terrors of our &s;piritual adver&s;aries are at the &s;ame time before our eyes, we &s;hall be &s;tedfa&s;t and immoveable, and al|ways abounding in the work of the Lord. We &s;hall not envy the high and mighty. We &s;hall not be moved to neglect the lea&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="77">
duty, by the tide of popular prejudices. Pomp and &s;hew, will but little affect us. Truth will have more charms in it than all the world be&s;ides. We will blu&s;h for tho&s;e, who triumph in their &s;ucce&s;sful am|bition. We will &s;it ea&s;y under the laugh|ter of fools. We will pity the &s;corner; and, all the pride, reviling, and ridicule, to which we &s;tand expo&s;ed, &s;hall not be able to touch us.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, that the world is again&s;t us, &s;hould not greatly affect us, or rather &s;hould give us no kind of pain or di&s;|couragement. The world was again&s;t our Lord; but the High and Lofty One, who inhabiteth Eternity was his refuge; and we, in like manner, if we follow his &s;teps, &s;hall be always &s;ecure under the arms of Omnipotence. The friend&s;hip of God, will always &s;upport and refre&s;h us, will give light to our &s;ouls in the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death, and, at la&s;t, deliver us from every Evil, and crown us with every good. His friend|&s;hip, truly, is &s;ufficient to reconcile us to all circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>To know, likewi&s;e, that our inevitable allegiance to Him, brings troubles upon us, that we &s;uffer for e&s;pou&s;ing the Ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="57" REF="78">
Laws of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Truth, in&s;tead of making us di&s;con&s;olate, mu&s;t make us always happy. For, this is the noble&s;t cau&s;e in the world. To vindicate &s;uch a cau&s;e, places us among the fir&s;t of human beings. To be ca&s;t into dun|geons for &s;uch a cau&s;e, is a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing honour. To fini&s;h our cour&s;e upon the &s;caffold for &s;uch a cau&s;e, is our great|e&s;t glory. Nay; we mention, with a high veneration, tho&s;e heroes, who fall in battle fighting for their country. With a &s;ort of wonder and reverence, we re|hear&s;e the name of Wolfe. But, what are ten thou&s;and &s;uch to the great Captain of our Salvation! What are ten thou|&s;and &s;uch, even to any other man, who &s;acrifices his Life in the cau&s;e of &s;acred truth! The martyrs of Religious Liberty &s;uffer for our deare&s;t privileges, and our be&s;t intere&s;ts, for the cau&s;e of God, and the mo&s;t important concerns of all man|kind; and their names are written in Heaven, and &s;hall be held in EVER|LASTING REMEMBRANCE.</P>
