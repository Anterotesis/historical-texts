<HEAD>DAN and JANE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GOOD Dan and Jane were man and wife,</L>
<L>And liv'd a loving kind of life;</L>
<L>One point, however, they di&s;puted,</L>
<L>And each by turns his mate confuted.</L>
<L>'Twas Faith and Works&mdash;this knotty que&s;tion</L>
<L>They found not ea&s;y of dige&s;tion.</L>
<L>While Dan for Faith alone contended,</L>
<L>Jane equally Good Works defended.</L>
<L>"They are not Chri&s;tians &s;ure, but Turks,</L>
<L>"Who build on Faith and &s;coff at Works."</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">
Quoth Jane&mdash;While eager Dan reply'd,</L>
<L>"By none but heathens Faith's deny'd.</L>
<L>"I'll tell you wife," at length quoth Dan,</L>
<L>"A &s;tory of a right good man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"A Patriarch &s;age, of ancient days,</L>
<L>"A man of Faith, whom all mu&s;t prai&s;e.</L>
<L>"In his own country he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd,</L>
<L>"Whate'er can make a wi&s;e man ble&s;t;</L>
<L>"His was the flock, the field, the &s;pring,</L>
<L>"In &s;hort, a little rural king.</L>
<L>"Yet, pleas'd he quits this native land,</L>
<L>"By Faith in the Divine command.</L>
<L>"God bade him go, and he, content,</L>
<L>"Went forth not knowing where he went.</L>
<L>"He tru&s;ted in the promi&s;e made,</L>
<L>"And, undi&s;puting, &s;trait obeyed.</L>
<L>"The Heavenly word he did not doubt,</L>
<L>"But prov'd his Faith by going out."</L>
<L>Jane an&s;wer'd with &s;ome little pride&mdash;</L>
<L>"I've an example on my &s;ide;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">
"And tho' my tale be &s;omewhat longer,</L>
<L>"I tru&s;t you'll find it va&s;tly &s;tronger.</L>
<L>"I'll tell you, Daniel, of a man,</L>
<L>"The holie&s;t &s;ince the world began;</L>
<L>"Who now God's favour is receiving,</L>
<L>"For prompt <HI>obeying,</HI> not <HI>believing.</HI></L>
<L>"One only &s;on this man po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>"In whom his righteous age was ble&s;t;</L>
<L>"And more to mark the grace of Heaven,</L>
<L>"This &s;on by miracle was given.</L>
<L>"And from this child the word Divine</L>
<L>"Had promis'd an illu&s;trious line.</L>
<L>"When lo! at once a voice he hears,</L>
<L>"Which &s;ounds like thunder in his ears,</L>
<L>"God &s;ays&mdash;Go &s;acrifice thy &s;on!</L>
<L>"&mdash;This moment, Lord, it &s;hall be done.</L>
<L>"He goes, and in&s;tantly prepares,</L>
<L>"To &s;lay this child of many prayers.</L>
<L>"Now here you &s;ee the grand expedience,</L>
<L>"Of <HI>Works,</HI> of actual &s;ound <HI>Obedience.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
"This was not <HI>Faith,</HI> but <HI>act</HI> and deed,</L>
<L>"The Lord commands&mdash;the child &s;hall bleed.</L>
<L>"Thus Abraham <HI>acted,"</HI> Jenny cried;</L>
<L>"Thus Abraham <HI>tru&s;ted,"</HI> Dan replied.</L>
<L>"Abraham," quoth Jane, "why that's my man,</L>
<L>"No, Abraham's him I mean," &s;ays Dan.</L>
<L>"He &s;tands a monument of <HI>Faith;"</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>"No, 'tis for <HI>Works</HI> the Scripture &s;aith."</L>
<L>"'Tis for his faith that I defend him:"</L>
<L>"'Tis for obedience I commend him."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he&mdash;thus &s;he&mdash;both warmly feel,</L>
<L>And lo&s;e their temper in their zeal;</L>
<L>Too quick each other's choice to blame,</L>
<L>They did not &s;ee each meant the &s;ame.</L>
<L>"At length, good wife," &s;aid hone&s;t Dan,</L>
<L>"We're talking of the &s;elf &s;ame man.</L>
<L>"The works you prai&s;e I own indeed,</L>
<L>"Grow from that faith for which I plead;</L>
<L>"And Abraham, whom for faith I quote,</L>
<L>"For works de&s;erves e&s;pecial note:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6">
"Tis not enough of faith to <HI>talk,</HI></L>
<L>"A man of God, with God mu&s;t walk:</L>
<L>"Our doctrines are at la&s;t the &s;ame,</L>
<L>"They only differ in the name.</L>
<L>"The faith I fight for is the root,</L>
<L>"The works you value are the fruit.</L>
<L>"How &s;hall you know my creed's &s;incere,</L>
<L>"Unle&s;s in works my faith appear?</L>
<L>"How &s;hall I know a tree's alive,</L>
<L>"Unle&s;s I &s;ee it bear and thrive?</L>
<L>"Your works not growing on my root,</L>
<L>"Wou'd prove they were not genuine fruit.</L>
<L>"If faith produce no works, I &s;ee,</L>
<L>"That faith is not a living tree.</L>
<L>"Thus faith and works together grow,</L>
<L>"No &s;eparate life they e'er can know:</L>
<L>"They're &s;oul and body, hand and heart,</L>
<L>"What God hath join'd, let no one part.</L>
