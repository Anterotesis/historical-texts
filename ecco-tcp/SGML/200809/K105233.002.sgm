<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF DON RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>MY journey was uncommonly agree|able: I found the baron a man of &s;ome &s;en&s;e, but little knowledge of the world. He had pa&s;&s;ed a great part of his life with|out &s;tirring beyond the precincts of his own
<PB N="2" REF="3">
domains, and con&s;equently his manners were far from being the mo&s;t poli&s;hed; but he was hearty, good-humoured, and friend|ly. His attention to me was all that I could wi&s;h, and I had every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with his behaviour. His ruling pa&s;&s;ion was hunting, which he had brought him&s;elf to con&s;ider as a &s;erious occupation; and, when talking over &s;ome remarkable chace, he treated the &s;ubject with as much gravity as it had been a battle on which the fate of two kingdoms was depending. I happened to be a tolerable &s;port&s;man: &s;oon after my ar|rival at Lindenberg, I gave &s;ome proofs of my dexterity. The baron immediately marked me down for a man of genius, and vowed to me an eternal friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>That friend&s;hip was become to me by no means indifferent. At the ca&s;tle of Lin|denberg, I beheld for the fir&s;t time your &s;i&s;ter, the lovely Agnes. For me, who&s;e heart was unoccupied, and who grieved at the void, to &s;ee her and to love her were the &s;ame. I found in Agnes all that was requi|&s;ite
<PB N="3" REF="4">
to &s;ecure my affection. She was then &s;carcely &s;ixteen; her per&s;on light and ele|gant was already formed; &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;e|veral talents in perfection, particularly tho&s;e of mu&s;ic and drawing: her character was gay, open, and good-humoured; and the graceful &s;implicity of her dre&s;s and man|ners formed an advantageous contra&s;t to the art and &s;tudied coquetry of the Pari&s;ian dames, whom I had ju&s;t quitted. From the moment that I beheld her, I felt the mo&s;t lively intere&s;t in her fate. I made many enquiries re&s;pecting her of the ba|rone&s;s.</P>
<P>"She is my niece," replied that lady; "you are &s;till ignorant, Don Alphon&s;o, that I am your country-woman. I am &s;i&s;ter to the duke of Medina Celi. Agnes is the daughter of my &s;econd brother, Don Ga&s;|ton: &s;he has been de&s;tined to the convent from her cradle, and will &s;oon make her profe&s;&s;ion at Madrid."</P>
<P>[Here Lorenzo interrupted the marquis by an exclamation of &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">"Intended for the convent from her cra|dle!" &s;aid he: "By heaven, this is the fir&s;t word that I ever heard of &s;uch a de&s;ign."</P>
<P>"I believe it, my dear Lorenzo," an&s;wer|ed Don Raymond; "but you mu&s;t li&s;ten to me with patience. You will not be le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, when I relate &s;ome particulars of your family &s;till unknown to you, and which I have learnt from the mouth of Agnes her|&s;elf."</P>
<P>He then re&s;umed his narrative as fol|lows:]</P>
<P>You cannot but be aware, that your parents were unfortunately &s;laves to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;u|per&s;tition: when this foible was called into play, their every other &s;entiment, their every other pa&s;&s;ion, yielded to its irre&s;i&s;tible &s;trength. While &s;he was big with Agnes, your mother was &s;eized by a dangerous ill|ne&s;s, and given over by her phy&s;icians. In this &s;ituation Donna Ine&s;illa vowed, that if &s;he recovered from her malady, the child then living in her bo&s;om, if a girl, &s;hould be dedicated to St. Clare; if a boy, to St.
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Benedict. Her prayers were heard; &s;he got rid of her complaint; Agnes entered the world alive, and was immediately de&s;tined to the &s;ervice of St. Clare.</P>
<P>Don Ga&s;ton readily chimed in with his lady's wi&s;hes: but knowing the &s;entiments of the duke, his brother, re&s;pecting a mo|na&s;tic life, it was determined that your &s;i&s;|ter's de&s;tination &s;hould be carefully con|cealed from him. The better to guard the &s;ecret, it was re&s;olved that Agnes &s;hould accompany her aunt, Donna Rodolpha, into Germany, whither that lady was on the point of following her new-married hu&s;band, ba|ron Lindenberg. On her arrival at that e&s;tate, the young Agnes was put into a con|vent, &s;ituated but a few miles from the ca&s;|tle. The nuns, to whom her education was confided, performed their charge with ex|actitude: they made her a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of many accompli&s;hments, and &s;trove to infu&s;e into her mind a ta&s;te for the retirement and tranquil plea&s;ures of a convent. But a &s;ecret in&s;tinct made the young reclu&s;e &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="6" REF="7">
that &s;he was not born for &s;olitude: in all the freedom of youth and gaiety, &s;he &s;crupled not to treat as ridiculous many ceremonies which the nuns regarded with awe; and &s;he was never more happy than when her lively imagination in&s;pired her with &s;ome &s;cheme to plague the &s;tiff lady abbe&s;s, or the ugly ill-tempered old portere&s;s. She looked with di&s;gu&s;t upon the pro&s;pect before her: however, no alternative was offered to her, and &s;he &s;ubmitted to the decree of her parents, though not without &s;ecret repining.</P>
<P>That repugnance &s;he had not art enough to conceal long: Don Ga&s;ton was informed, of it. Alarmed, Lorenzo, le&s;t your affec|tion for her &s;hould oppo&s;e it&s;elf to his pro|jects, and le&s;t you &s;hould po&s;itively object to your &s;i&s;ter's mi&s;ery, he re&s;olved to keep the whole affair from <HI>your</HI> knowledge as well as the duke's, till the &s;acrifice &s;hould be con&s;ummated. The &s;ea&s;on of her tak|ing the veil was fixed for the time when you &s;hould be upon your travels: in the mean while no hint was dropped of Donna Ine|&s;illa's
<PB N="7" REF="8">
fatal vow. Your &s;i&s;ter was never per|mitted to know your direction. All your letters were read before &s;he received them, and tho&s;e parts effaced which were likely to nouri&s;h her inclination for the world: her an&s;wers were dictated either by her aunt, or by dame Cunegonda, her gover|ne&s;s. The&s;e particulars I learnt partly from Agnes, partly from the barone&s;s her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I immediately determined upon re&s;cuing this lovely girl from a fate &s;o contrary to her inclinations, and ill-&s;uited to her merit. I endeavoured to ingratiate my&s;elf into her favour: I boa&s;ted of my friend&s;hip and in|timacy with you. She li&s;tened to me with avidity; &s;he &s;eemed to devour my words while I &s;poke in your prai&s;e, and her eyes thanked me for my affection to her brother. My con&s;tant and unremitted attention at length gained me her heart, and with dif|ficulty I obliged her to confe&s;s that &s;he loved me. When, however, I propo&s;ed her
<PB N="8" REF="9">
quitting the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg, &s;he re|jected the idea in po&s;itive terms.</P>
<P>"Be generous, Alphon&s;o," &s;he &s;aid; "you po&s;&s;e&s;s my heart, but u&s;e not the gift ignobly. Employ not your a&s;cendancy over me in per&s;uading me to take a &s;tep at which I &s;hould hereafter have to blu&s;h. I am young and de&s;erted: my brother, my only friend, is &s;eparated from me, and my other relations act with me as my enemies. Take pity on my unprotected &s;ituation. In&s;tead of &s;educing me to an action which would cover me with &s;hame, &s;trive rather to gain the affections of tho&s;e who govern me. The baron e&s;teems you. My aunt, to others ever har&s;h, proud, and contemptu|ous, remembers that you re&s;cued her from the hands of murderers, and wears with you alone the appearance of kindne&s;s and benig|nity. Try then your influence over my guardians. If they con&s;ent to our union, my hand is yours. From your account of my brother, I cannot doubt your obtaining
<PB N="9" REF="10">
his approbation: and when they find the impo&s;&s;ibility of executing their de&s;ign, I tru&s;t that my parents will excu&s;e my di&s;|obedience, and expiate by &s;ome other &s;acri|fice my mother's fatal vow."</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t moment that I beheld Agnes, I had endeavoured to conciliate the favour of her relations. Authori&s;ed by the confe&s;&s;ion of her regard, I redoubled my exertions. My principal battery was di|rected again&s;t the barone&s;s: it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover, that her word was law in the ca&s;|tle: her hu&s;band paid her the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and con&s;idered her as a &s;uperior being. She was about forty: in her youth &s;he had been a beauty; but her charms had been upon that large &s;cale which can but ill &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of years: however, &s;he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome remains of them. Her under&s;tanding was &s;trong and excellent when not ob&s;cured by prejudice, which un|luckily was but &s;eldom the ca&s;e. Her pa&s;|&s;ions were violent: &s;he &s;pared no pains to gratify them, and pur&s;ued with unremitting
<PB N="10" REF="11">
vengeance tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to her wi&s;hes. The warme&s;t of friends, the mo&s;t inveterate of enemies, &s;uch was the barone&s;s Lindenberg.</P>
<P>I laboured ince&s;&s;antly to plea&s;e her: unluckily I &s;ucceeded but too well. She &s;eemed gratified by my attention, and treated me with a di&s;tinction accorded by her to no one el&s;e. One of my daily occupations was reading to her for &s;everal hours: tho&s;e hours I &s;hould much rather have pa&s;&s;ed with Agnes; but as I was con&s;cious that complai&s;ance for her aunt would advance our union, I &s;ubmitted with a good grace to the penance impo&s;ed upon me. Donna Rodolpha's library was principally com|po&s;ed of old Spani&s;h romances: the&s;e were her favourite &s;tudies, and once a day one of the&s;e unmerciful volumes was put regu|larly into my hands. I read the weari&s;ome adventures of <HI>"Percefore&s;t," "Tirante the White," "Palmerin of England,"</HI> and <HI>"the Knight of the Sun,"</HI> till the book was on the point of falling from my hands through
<PB N="11" REF="12">
ennui. However, the increa&s;ing plea&s;ure which the barone&s;s &s;eemed to take in my &s;ociety, encouraged me to per&s;evere; and latterly &s;he &s;hewed for me a partiality &s;o marked, that Agnes advi&s;ed me to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of declaring our mu|tual pa&s;&s;ion to her aunt.</P>
<P>One evening I was alone with Donna Rodolpha, in her own apartment. As our readings generally treated of love, Agnes was never permitted to a&s;&s;i&s;t at them. I was ju&s;t congratulating my&s;elf on having fini&s;hed <HI>"the Loves of Tri&s;tan and the Queen I&s;eult</HI>&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ah! the unfortunates!" cried the ba|rone&s;s: "How &s;ay you, Segnor? Do you think it po&s;&s;ible for man to feel an attach|ment &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;incere?"</P>
<P>"I cannot doubt it," replied I; "my own heart furni&s;hes me with the certainty. Ah! Donna Rodolpha, might I but hope for your approbation of my love! might I but confe&s;s the name of my mi&s;tre&s;s, with|out incurring your re&s;entment!"</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">She interrupted me.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e I were to &s;pare you that con|fe&s;&s;ion? Suppo&s;e I were to acknowledge that the object of your de&s;ires is not un|known to me? Suppo&s;e I were to &s;ay, that &s;he returns your affection, and laments not le&s;s &s;incerely than your&s;elf the unhappy vows which &s;eparate her from you?"</P>
<P>"Ah! Donna Rodolpha!" I exclaimed, throwing my&s;elf upon my knees before her, and pre&s;&s;ing her hand to my lips, "you have di&s;covered my &s;ecret! What is your deci&s;ion? Mu&s;t I de&s;pair, or may I reckon upon your favour?"</P>
<P>She withdrew not the hand which I held; but &s;he turned from me, and covered her face with the other.</P>
<P>"How can I refu&s;e it you?" &s;he replied: "Ah! Don Alphon&s;o, I have long perceived to whom your attentions were directed, but till now I perceived not the impre&s;&s;ion which they made upon my heart. At length, I can no longer hide my weakne&s;s either from my&s;elf or from you. I yield to
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the violence of my pa&s;&s;ion, and own that I adore you! For three long months I &s;tifled my de&s;ires; but growing &s;tronger by re&s;i&s;t|ance, I &s;ubmit to their impetuo&s;ity. Pride, fear, and honour, re&s;pect for my&s;elf, and my engagements to the baron, all are van|qui&s;hed. I &s;acrifice them to my love for you, and it &s;till &s;eems to me that I pay too mean a price for your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed for an an&s;wer.&mdash;Judge, my Lorenzo, what mu&s;t have been my con|fu&s;ion at this di&s;covery. I at once &s;aw all the magnitude of this ob&s;tacle, which I had my&s;elf rai&s;ed to my happine&s;s. The ba|rone&s;s had placed tho&s;e attentions to her own account, which I had merely paid her for the &s;ake of Agnes: and the &s;trength of her expre&s;&s;ions, the looks which accompa|nied them, and my knowledge of her re|vengeful di&s;po&s;ition, made me tremble for my&s;elf and my beloved. I was &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes. I knew not how to reply to her declaration: I could only re&s;olve to clear up the mi&s;take without delay, and
<PB N="14" REF="15">
for the pre&s;ent to conceal from her know|ledge the name of my mi&s;tre&s;s. No &s;ooner had &s;he avowed her pa&s;&s;ion, than the tran&s;|ports which before were evident in my features gave place to con&s;ternation and con&s;traint. I dropped her hand, and ro&s;e from my knees. The change in my coun|tenance did not e&s;cape her ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"What means this &s;ilence?" &s;aid &s;he in a trembling voice: "Where is that joy which you led me to expect?"</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Segnora," I an&s;wered, "if what nece&s;&s;ity forces from me &s;hould &s;eem har&s;h and ungrateful. To encourage you in an error, which, however it may flatter my&s;elf, mu&s;t prove to you the &s;ource of di&s;appointment, would make me appear criminal in every eye. Honour obliges me to inform you, that you have mi&s;taken for the &s;olicitude of love what was only the attention of friend&s;hip. The latter &s;enti|ment is that which I wi&s;hed to excite in your bo&s;om: to entertain a warmer, re&s;pect for you forbids me, and gratitude for the
<PB N="15" REF="16">
baron's generous treatment. Perhaps the&s;e rea&s;ons would not be &s;ufficient to &s;hield me from your attractions, were it not that my affections are already be&s;towed upon ano|ther. You have charms, Segnora, which might captivate the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible; no heart unoccupied could re&s;i&s;t them. Hap|py is it for me, that mine is no longer in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or I &s;hould have to reproach my&s;elf for ever with having violated the laws of ho&s;pitality. Recollect your&s;elf, noble lady! recollect what is owed by you to honour, by me to the baron, and replace by e&s;teem and friend&s;hip tho&s;e &s;entiments which I never can return."</P>
<P>The barone&s;s turned pale at this unex|pected and po&s;itive declaration: &s;he doubt|ed whether &s;he &s;lept or woke. At length recovering from her &s;urpri&s;e, con&s;ternation gave place to rage, and the blood ru&s;hed back into her cheeks with violence.</P>
<P>"Villain!" &s;he cried; "Mon&s;ter of de|ceit! Thus is the avowal of my love re|ceived? Is it thus that . . . . but, no, no! it
<PB N="16" REF="17">
cannot, it &s;hall not be! Alphon&s;o, behold me at your feet! Be witne&s;s of my de&s;pair! Look with pity on a woman who loves you with &s;incere affection! She who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es your heart, how has &s;he merited &s;uch a trea&s;ure? What &s;acrifice has &s;he made to you? What rai&s;es her above Rodolpha?"</P>
<P>I endeavoured to lift her from her knees.</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake, Segnora, re&s;train the&s;e tran&s;ports; they di&s;grace your&s;elf and me. Your exclamations may be heard, and your &s;ecret divulged to your attendants. I &s;ee that my pre&s;ence only irritates you: permit me to retire."</P>
<P>I prepared to quit the apartment: the barone&s;s caught me &s;uddenly by the arm.</P>
<P>"And who is this happy rival?" &s;aid &s;he in a menacing tone; "I will know her name, and <HI>when</HI> I know it . . . . .! She is &s;ome one in my power; you entreated my favour, my protection! Let me but find her, let me but know who dares to rob me of your heart, and &s;he &s;hall &s;uffer every tor|ment which jealou&s;y and di&s;appointment
<PB N="17" REF="18">
can inflict. Who is &s;he? An&s;wer me this moment. Hope not to conceal her from my vengeance! Spies &s;hall be &s;et over you; every &s;tep, every look &s;hall be watched; your eyes will di&s;cover my rival; I &s;hall know her; and when &s;he is found, tremble, Alphon&s;o, for her and for your&s;elf."</P>
<P>As &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words, her fury mounted to &s;uch a pitch as to &s;top her powers of re&s;piration. She panted, groan|ed, and at length fainted away. As &s;he was falling I caught her in my arms, and placed her upon a &s;opha. Then ha&s;tening to the door, I &s;ummoned her women to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I committed her to their care, and &s;eized the opportunity of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>Agitated and confu&s;ed beyond expre&s;|&s;ion, I bent my &s;teps towards the garden. The benignity with which the barone&s;s had li&s;tened to me at fir&s;t, rai&s;ed my hopes to the highe&s;t pitch: I imagined her to have perceived my attachment for her niece, and to approve of it. Extreme was my di&s;|appointment at under&s;tanding the true pur|port
<PB N="18" REF="19">
of her di&s;cour&s;e. I knew not what cour&s;e to take: the &s;uper&s;tition of the pa|rents of Agnes, aided by her aunt's unfor|tunate pa&s;&s;ion, &s;eemed to oppo&s;e &s;uch ob|&s;tacles to our union as were almo&s;t in&s;ur|mountable.</P>
<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed by a low parlour, who&s;e win|dows looked into the garden, through the door which &s;tood half open I ob&s;erved Agnes &s;eated at a table. She was occupied in drawing, and &s;everal unfini&s;hed &s;ketch|es were &s;cattered round her. I entered, &s;till undetermined whether I &s;hould ac|quaint her with the declaration of the ba|rone&s;s.</P>
<P>"Oh! is it only you?" &s;aid &s;he, rai&s;ing her head: "You are no &s;tranger, and I &s;hall continue my occupation without cere|mony. Take a chair, and &s;eat your&s;elf by me."</P>
<P>I obeyed, and placed my&s;elf near the table. Uncon&s;cious what I was doing, and totally occupied by the &s;cene which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, I took up &s;ome of the drawings,
<PB N="19" REF="20">
and ca&s;t my eyes over them. One of the &s;ubjects &s;truck me from its &s;ingularity. It repre&s;ented the great hall of the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. A door conducting to a nar|row &s;tair-ca&s;e &s;tood half open. In the fore|ground appeared a group of figures, placed in the mo&s;t grote&s;que attitudes; terror was expre&s;&s;ed upon every countenance. Here was one upon his knees, with his eyes ca&s;t up to heaven, and praying mo&s;t devoutly; there, another was creeping away upon all fours. Some hid their faces in their cloaks, or the laps of their companions; &s;ome had con|cealed them&s;elves beneath a table, on which the remnants of a fea&s;t were vi&s;ible; while others, with gaping mouths and eyes wide-&s;tretched, pointed to a figure &s;uppo&s;ed to have created this di&s;turbance. It repre&s;ent|ed a female of more than human &s;tature, clothed in the habit of &s;ome religious order. Her face was veiled; on her arm hung a chaplet of beads; her dre&s;s was in &s;everal places &s;tained with the blood which
<PB N="20" REF="21">
trickled from a wound upon her bo&s;om. In one hand &s;he held a lamp, in the other a large knife, and &s;he &s;eemed advancing towards the iron gates of the hall.</P>
<Q><L>"What does this mean, Agnes?" &s;aid I:</L>
<L>"Is this &s;ome invention of your own?"</L>
<L>She ca&s;t her eyes upon the drawing.</L></Q>
<P>"Oh! no," &s;he replied; "'tis the inven|tion of much wi&s;er heads than mine. But can you po&s;&s;ibly have lived at Lindenberg for three whole months without hearing of the bleeding nun?"</P>
<P>"You are the fir&s;t who ever mentioned the name to me. Pray, who may the lady be?"</P>
<P>"That is more than I can pretend to tell you. All my knowledge of her hi&s;tory comes from an old tradition in this family, which has been handed down from father to &s;on, and is firmly credited throughout the baron's domains. Nay, the baron believes it him&s;elf; and as for my aunt, who has a natural turn for the marvellous, &s;he would
<PB N="21" REF="22">
&s;ooner doubt the veracity of the Bible than of the bleeding nun. Shall I tell you this hi&s;tory?"</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that &s;he would oblige me much by relating it: &s;he re&s;umed her drawing, and then proceeded as follows in a tone of burle&s;qued gravity:</P>
<P>"It is &s;urpri&s;ing that in all the chronicles of pa&s;t times this remarkable per&s;onage is never once mentioned. Fain would I re|count to you her life; but unluckily till after her death &s;he was never known to have exi&s;ted. Then fir&s;t did &s;he think it nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome noi&s;e in the world, and with that intention &s;he made bold to &s;eize upon the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. Hav|ing a good ta&s;te, &s;he took up her abode in the be&s;t room of the hou&s;e; and once e&s;ta|bli&s;hed there, &s;he began to amu&s;e her&s;elf by knocking about the tables and chairs in the middle of the night. Perhaps &s;he was a bad &s;leeper, but this I have never been able to a&s;certain. According to the tradi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, this entertainment commenced about
<PB N="22" REF="23">
a century ago. It was accompanied with &s;hrieking, howling, groaning, &s;wearing, and many other agreeable noi&s;es of the &s;ame kind. But though one particular room was more e&s;pecially honoured with her vi&s;its, &s;he did not entirely confine her&s;elf to it. She occa&s;ionally ventured into the old galleries, paced up and down the &s;pa|cious halls; or, &s;ometimes &s;topping at the doors of the chambers, &s;he wept and wailed there to the univer&s;al terror of the inhabitants. In the&s;e nocturnal excur&s;ions &s;he was &s;een by different people, who all de|&s;cribe her appearance as you behold it here traced by the hand of her unworthy hi&s;|torian."</P>
<P>The &s;ingularity of this account in&s;en&s;ibly engaged my attention.</P>
<P>"Did &s;he never &s;peak to tho&s;e who met her?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Not &s;he. The &s;pecimens indeed which &s;he gave nightly of her talents for conver|&s;ation, were by no means inviting. Some|times the ca&s;tle rung with oaths and execra|tions:
<PB N="23" REF="24">
a moment after &s;he repeated her pa|terno&s;ter: now &s;he howled out the mo&s;t horrible bla&s;phemies, and then chaunted De profundis as orderly as if &s;till in the choir. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;eemed a mighty ca|pricious being: but whether &s;he prayed or cur&s;ed, whether &s;he was impious or devout, &s;he always contrived to terrify her auditors out of their &s;en&s;es. The ca&s;tle became &s;carcely habitable; and its lord was &s;o frightened by the&s;e midnight revels, that one fine morning he was found dead in his bed. This &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to plea&s;e the nun mightily, for now &s;he made more noi&s;e than ever. But the next baron proved too cunning for her. He made his appearance with a celebrated exorci&s;er in his hand, who feared not to &s;hut him&s;elf up for a night, in the haunted chamber. There it &s;eems that he had a hard battle with the gho&s;t before &s;he would promi&s;e to be quiet. She was ob&s;tinate, but he was more &s;o; and at length &s;he con&s;ented to let the inhabi|tants of the ca&s;tle take a good night's re&s;t.
<PB N="24" REF="25">
For &s;ome time after no news was heard of her. But at the end of five years the exor|ci&s;er died, and then the nun ventured to peep abroad again. However, &s;he was now grown much more tractable and well-behaved. She walked about in &s;ilence, and never made her appearance above once in five years. This cu&s;tom, if you will be|lieve the baron, &s;he &s;till continues. He is fully per&s;uaded, that on the fifth of May of every fifth year, as &s;oon as the clock &s;trikes one, the door of the haunted chamber opens. [Ob&s;erve, that this room has been &s;hut up for near a century.] Then out walks the gho&s;tly nun with her lamp and dagger: &s;he de&s;cends the &s;tair-ca&s;e of the ea&s;tern tower, and cro&s;&s;es the great hall. On that night the porter always leaves the gates of the ca&s;tle open, out of re&s;pect to the apparition: not that this is thought by any means nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince &s;he could ea&s;ily whip through the key-hole if &s;he cho&s;e it; but merely out of politene&s;s, and to prevent her from making her exit in a way &s;o
<PB N="25" REF="26">
derogatory to the dignity of her gho&s;t-&s;hip."</P>
<P>"And whither does &s;he go on quitting the ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>"To heaven, I hope; but if &s;he does, the place certainly is not to her ta&s;te, for &s;he always returns after an hour's ab&s;ence. The lady then retires to her chamber, and is quiet for another five years."</P>
<P>"And you believe this, Agnes?"</P>
<P>"How can you a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion? No, no, Alphon&s;o! I have too much rea&s;on to lament &s;uper&s;tition's influence to be its vic|tim my&s;elf. However, I mu&s;t not avow my incredulity to the barone&s;s: &s;he enter|tains not a doubt of the truth of this hi&s;tory. As to dame Cunegonda, my governe&s;s, &s;he prote&s;ts that fifteen years ago &s;he &s;aw the &s;pectre with her own eyes. She related to me one evening, how &s;he and &s;everal other dome&s;tics had been terrified while at &s;up|per by the appearance of the bleeding nun, as the gho&s;t is called in the ca&s;tle: 'tis from her account that I drew this &s;ketch, and
<PB N="26" REF="27">
you may be certain that Cunegonda was not omitted. There &s;he is! I &s;hall never for|get what a pa&s;&s;ion &s;he was in, and how ugly &s;he looked while &s;he &s;colded me for having made her picture &s;o like her&s;elf!"</P>
<P>Here &s;he pointed to a burle&s;que figure of an old woman in an attitude of terror.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the melancholy which oppre&s;&s;|ed me, I could not help &s;miling at the play|ful imagination of Agnes: &s;he had perfectly pre&s;erved dame Cunegonda's re&s;emblance, but had &s;o much exaggerated every fault, and rendered every feature &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly laughable, that I could ea&s;ily conceive the duenna's anger.</P>
<P>"The figure is admirable, my dear Agnes! I knew not that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch talents for the ridiculous."</P>
<P>"Stay a moment," &s;he replied; "I will &s;hew you a figure &s;till more ridiculous than dame Cunegonda's. If it plea&s;es you, you may di&s;po&s;e of it as &s;eems be&s;t to your|&s;elf."</P>
<P>She ro&s;e, and went to a cabinet at &s;ome
<PB N="27" REF="28">
little di&s;tance: unlocking a drawer, &s;he took out a &s;mall ca&s;e, which &s;he opened, and pre&s;ented to me.</P>
<P>"Do you know the re&s;emblance?" &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling.</P>
<P>It was her own.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported at the gift, I pre&s;&s;ed the portrait to my lips with pa&s;&s;ion: I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and declared my grati|tude in the warme&s;t and mo&s;t affectionate terms. She li&s;tened to me with complai|&s;ance, and a&s;&s;ured me that &s;he &s;hared my &s;entiments; when &s;uddenly &s;he uttered a loud &s;hriek, di&s;engaged the hand which I held, and flew from the room by a door which opened to the garden. Amazed at this abrupt departure, I ro&s;e ha&s;tily from my knees. I beheld with confu&s;ion the barone&s;s &s;tanding near me, glowing with jealou&s;y, and almo&s;t choaked with rage. On recovering from her &s;woon, &s;he had tortured her imagination to di&s;cover her concealed rival. No one appeared to de|&s;erve her &s;u&s;picions more than Agnes. She
<PB N="28" REF="29">
immediately ha&s;tened to find her niece, tax her with encouraging my addre&s;&s;es, and a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf whether her conjectures were well-grounded. Unfortunately &s;he had al|ready &s;een enough to need no other confir|mation. She arrived at the door of the room, at the preci&s;e moment when Agnes gave me her portrait. She heard me pro|fe&s;s an everla&s;ting attachment to her rival, and &s;aw me kneeling at her feet. She ad|vanced to &s;eparate us; we were too much occupied by each other to perceive her ap|proach, and were not aware of it till Agnes beheld her &s;tanding by my &s;ide.</P>
<P>Rage on the part of Donna Rodolpha, embarra&s;&s;ment on mine, for &s;ome time kept us both &s;ilent. The lady recovered her&s;elf fir&s;t.</P>
<P>"My &s;u&s;picions then were ju&s;t," &s;aid &s;he; "the coquetry of my niece has triumphed, and 'tis to her that I am &s;acrificed. In one re&s;pect, however, I am fortunate; I &s;hall not be the only one who laments a di&s;ap|pointed pa&s;&s;ion. You, too, &s;hall know
<PB N="29" REF="30">
what it is to love without hope! I daily ex|pect orders for re&s;toring Agnes to her pa|rents. Immediately upon her arrival in Spain, &s;he will take the veil, and place an in&s;uperable barrier to your union. You may &s;pare your &s;upplications." She con|tinued, perceiving me on the point of &s;peak|ing: "My re&s;olution is fixed and immove|able. Your mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hall remain a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in her chamber, till &s;he exchanges this ca&s;tle for the cloi&s;ter. Solitude will perhaps recall her to a &s;en&s;e of her duty: but to prevent your oppo&s;ing that wi&s;hed event, I mu&s;t inform you, Don Alphon&s;o, that your pre&s;ence here is no longer agree|able either to the baron or my&s;elf. It was not to talk non&s;en&s;e to my niece, that your relations &s;ent you to Germany: your bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to travel, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to impede any longer &s;o excellent a de&s;ign. Farewell, Segnor; remember, that to-mor|row morning we meet for the la&s;t time."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, &s;he darted upon me a look of pride, contempt, and malice, and
<PB N="30" REF="31">
quitted the apartment. I al&s;o retired to mine, and con&s;umed the night in planning the means of re&s;cuing Agnes from the power of her tyrannical aunt.</P>
<P>After the po&s;itive declaration of its mi&s;|tre&s;s, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to make a longer &s;tay at the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. Ac|cordingly, I the next day announced my immediate departure. The baron declared that it gave him &s;incere pain; and he ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in my favour &s;o warmly, that I endeavoured to win him over to my in|tere&s;t. Scarcely had I mentioned the name of Agnes when he &s;topped me &s;hort, and &s;aid, that it was totally out of his power to inter|fere in the bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;aw that it was in vain to argue; the barone&s;s governed her hu&s;band with de&s;potic &s;way, and I ea&s;ily perceived that &s;he had prejudiced him again&s;t the match. Agnes did not appear. I en|treated permi&s;&s;ion to take leave of her, but my prayer was rejected. I was obliged to depart without &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>At quitting him, the baron &s;hook my hand
<PB N="31" REF="32">
affectionately, and a&s;&s;ured me that, as &s;oon as his niece was gone, I might con&s;ider his hou&s;e as my own.</P>
<P>"Farewell, Don Alphon&s;o!" &s;aid the barone&s;s, and &s;tretched out her hand to me.</P>
<P>I took it, and offered to carry it to my lips. She prevented me. Her hu&s;band was at the other end of the room, and out of hearing.</P>
<P>"Take care of your&s;elf," &s;he continued; "my love is become hatred, and my wounded pride &s;hall not be unatoned. Go where you will, my vengeance &s;hall follow you!"</P>
<P>She accompanied the&s;e words with a look &s;ufficient to make me tremble. I an&s;wered not, but ha&s;tened to quit the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>As my chai&s;e drove out of the court, I looked up to the windows of your &s;i&s;ter's chamber: nobody was to be &s;een there. I threw my&s;elf back de&s;pondent in my car|riage. I was attended by no other &s;er|vants than a Frenchman, whom I had hired
<PB N="32" REF="33">
at Stra&s;bourg in Stephano's room, and my little page, whom I before mentioned to you. The fidelity, intelligence, and good temper of Theodore had already made him dear to me; but he now prepared to lay an obligation on me, which made me look upon him as a guardian genius. Scarcely had we proceeded half a mile from the ca&s;tle, when he rode up to the chai&s;e door.</P>
<P>"Take courage, Segnor!" &s;aid he in Spa|ni&s;h, which he had-already learnt to &s;peak with fluency and correctne&s;s: "While you were with the baron, I watched the moment when dame Cunegonda was below &s;tairs, and mounted into the chamber over that of donna Agnes. I &s;ang, as loud as I could, a little German air, well known to her, hoping that &s;he would recollect my voice. I was not di&s;appointed, for I &s;oon heard her win|dow open. I ha&s;tened to let down a &s;tring with which I had provided my&s;elf. Upon hearing the ca&s;ement clo&s;ed again, I drew up the &s;tring and, fa&s;tened to it, I found this &s;crap of paper."</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">He then pre&s;ented me with a &s;mall note, addre&s;&s;ed to me. I opened it with impa|tience. It contained the following words, written in pencil:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Conceal your&s;elf for the next fortnight in &s;ome neighbouring village. My aunt will believe you to have quitted Linden|berg, and I &s;hall be re&s;tored to liberty. I will be in the we&s;t pavilion at twelve on the night of the thirtieth. Fail not to be there, and we &s;hall have an opportunity of concerting our future plans. Adieu.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>AGNES.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>At peru&s;ing the&s;e lines my tran&s;ports ex|ceeded all bounds; neither did I &s;et any to the expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude which I heaped upon Theodore. In fact, his addre&s;s and at|tention merited my warme&s;t prai&s;e. You will readily believe that I had not entru&s;ted him with my pa&s;&s;ion for Agnes; but the arch youth had too much di&s;cernment not to di&s;cover my &s;ecret, and too much di&s;cre|tion
<PB N="34" REF="35">
not to conceal his knowledge of it. He ob&s;erved in &s;ilence what was going on, nor &s;trove to make him&s;elf an agent in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s till my intere&s;ts required his interfe|rence. I equally admired his judgment, his penetration, his addre&s;s, and his fidelity. This was not the fir&s;t occa&s;ion in which I had found him of infinite u&s;e, and I was every day more convinced of his quickne&s;s and capacity. During my &s;hort &s;tay at Stra&s;|bourg, he had applied him&s;elf diligently to learning the rudiments of Spani&s;h. He con|tinued to &s;tudy it, and with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that he &s;poke it with the &s;ame facility as his native language. He pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his time in reading. He had acquired much information for his age; and united the advantages of a lively countenance and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing figure to an excellent under|&s;tanding and the very be&s;t of hearts. He is now fifteen. He is &s;till in my &s;ervice; and, when you &s;ee him, I am &s;ure that he will plea&s;e you. But excu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion; I return to the &s;ubject which I quitted.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">I obeyed the in&s;tructions of Agnes. I proceeded to Munich: there I left my chai&s;e under the care of Lucas, my French &s;ervant, and then returned on hor&s;eback to a &s;mall village about four miles di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. Upon arriving there, a &s;tory was related to the ho&s;t at who&s;e inn I alighted, which prevented his won|dering at my making &s;o long a &s;tay in his hou&s;e. The old man, fortunately, was cre|dulous and incurious: he believed all I &s;aid, and &s;ought to know no more than what I thought proper to tell him. Nobody was with me but Theodore: both were di&s;|gui&s;ed; and as we kept our&s;elves clo&s;e, we were not &s;u&s;pected to be other than what we &s;eemed. In this manner the fortnight pa&s;&s;ed away. During that time I had the plea&s;ing conviction that Agnes was once more at liberty. She pa&s;&s;ed through the village with dame Cunegonda: &s;he &s;eemed in good health and &s;pirits, and talked to her companion without any appearance of con|&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">"Who are tho&s;e ladies?" &s;aid I to my ho&s;t as the carriage pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Baron Lindenberg's niece, with her governe&s;s," he replied: "&s;he goes regularly every Friday to the convent of St. Catharine, in which &s;he was brought up, and which is &s;ituated about a mile from hence."</P>
<P>You may be certain that I waited with impatience for the en&s;uing Friday. I again beheld my lovely mi&s;tre&s;s. She ca&s;t her eyes upon me as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the inn door. A blu&s;h which over&s;pread her cheek, told me that, in &s;pite of my di&s;gui&s;e, I had been re|cogni&s;ed. I bowed profoundly. She re|turned the compliment by a &s;light inclina|tion of the head, as if made to one inferior, and looked another way till the carriage was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>The long-expected, long wi&s;hed-for night arrived. It was calm, and the moon was at the full. As &s;oon as the clock &s;truck eleven I ha&s;tened to my appointment, determined not to be too late. Theodore had provided a ladder; I a&s;cended the garden wall with|out
<PB N="37" REF="38">
out difficulty. The page followed me, and drew the ladder after us. I po&s;ted my&s;elf in the we&s;t pavilion, and waited impatiently for the approach of Agnes. Every breeze that whi&s;pered, every leaf that fell, I be|lieved to be her foot-&s;tep, and ha&s;tened to meet her. Thus was I obliged to pa&s;s a full hour, every minute of which appeared to me an age. The ca&s;tle bell at length tolled twelve, and &s;carcely could I believe the night to be no farther advanced. Another quarter of an hour elap&s;ed, and I heard the light foot of my mi&s;tre&s;s approaching the pavilion with precaution. I flew to re|ceive her, and conducted her to a &s;eat. I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and was expre&s;&s;ing my joy at &s;eeing her, when &s;he thus inter|rupted me:</P>
<P>"We have no time to lo&s;e, Alphon&s;o: the moments are precious; for, though no more a pri&s;oner, Cunegonda watches my every &s;tep. An expre&s;s is arrived from my father; I mu&s;t depart immediately for Ma|drid, and 'tis with difficulty that I have ob|tained
<PB N="38" REF="39">
a week's delay. The &s;uper&s;tition of my parents, &s;upported by the repre&s;entations of my cruel aunt, leaves me no hope of &s;oftening them to compa&s;&s;ion. In this di|lemma, I have re&s;olved to commit my&s;elf to your honour. God grant that you may never give me cau&s;e to repent my re&s;olu|tion! Flight is my only re&s;ource from the horrors of a convent; and my imprudence mu&s;t be excu&s;ed by the urgency of the danger. Now li&s;ten to the plan by which I hope to effect my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"We are now at the thirtieth of April. On the fifth day from this the vi&s;ionary nun is expected to appear. In my la&s;t vi&s;it to the convent I provided my&s;elf with a dre&s;s proper for the character. A friend whom I have left there, and to whom I made no &s;cruple to confide my &s;ecret, readily con&s;ented to &s;upply me with a religious habit. Provide a carriage, and be with it at a little di&s;tance from the great gate of the ca&s;tle. As &s;oon as the clock &s;trikes "one," I &s;hall quit my chamber, dre&s;&s;ed in
<PB N="39" REF="40">
the &s;ame apparel as the gho&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to wear. Whoever meets me will be too much terrified to oppo&s;e my e&s;cape: I &s;hall ea&s;ily reach the door, and throw my&s;elf under your protection. Thus far &s;ucce&s;s is cer|tain: but, oh! Alphon&s;o, &s;hould you de|ceive me! Should you de&s;pi&s;e my impru|dence, and reward it with ingratitude, the world will not hold a being more wretched than my&s;elf! I feel all the dangers to which I &s;hall be expo&s;ed. I feel that I am giving you a right to treat me with levity: but I rely upon your love, upon your honour! The &s;tep which I am on the point of taking will incen&s;e my relations again&s;t me. Should you de&s;ert me; &s;hould you betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, I &s;hall have no friend to puni&s;h your in&s;ult, or &s;upport my cau&s;e. On your&s;elf alone re&s;ts all my hope; and if your own heart does not plead in my be|half, I am undone for ever!"</P>
<P>The tone in which &s;he pronounced the&s;e words was &s;o touching that, in &s;pite of my joy at receiving her promi&s;e to follow me, I
<PB N="40" REF="41">
could not help being affected. I al&s;o re|pined in &s;ecret at not having taken the pre|caution to provide a carriage at the village; in which ca&s;e, I might have carried off Agnes that very night. Such an attempt was now impracticable; neither carriage nor hor&s;es were to be procured nearer than Munich, which was di&s;tant from Linden|berg two good days journey. I was there|fore obliged to chime in with her plan, which, in truth, &s;eemed well arranged. Her di&s;gui&s;e would &s;ecure her from being &s;topped in quitting the ca&s;tle, and would enable her to &s;tep into the carriage at the very gate, without difficulty or lo&s;ing time.</P>
<P>Agnes reclined her head mournfully upon my &s;houlder, and, by the light of the moon, I &s;aw tears flowing down her cheek. I &s;trove to di&s;&s;ipate her melancholy, and en|couraged her to look forward to the pro&s;pect of happine&s;s. I prote&s;ted in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn terms that her virtue and innocence would be &s;afe in my keeping; and that, till the church had made her my lawful wife,
<PB N="41" REF="42">
her honour &s;hould be held by me as &s;acred as a &s;i&s;ter's. I told her, that my fir&s;t care &s;hould be to find you out, Lorenzo, and re|concile you to our union; and I was con|tinuing to &s;peak in the &s;ame &s;train, when a noi&s;e without alarmed me. Suddenly the door of the pavilion was thrown open, and Cunegonda &s;tood before us. She had heard Agnes &s;teal out of her chamber, followed her into the garden, and perceived her en|tering the pavilion. Favoured by the trees which &s;haded it, and unperceived by Theo|dore, who waited at a little di&s;tance, &s;he had approached in &s;ilence, and overheard our whole conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"Admirable!" cried Cunegonda, in a voice &s;hrill with pa&s;&s;ion, while Agnes ut|tered a loud &s;hriek. "By St. Barbara, young lady, you have an excellent inven|tion! You mu&s;t per&s;onate the bleeding nun, truly? What impiety! What in|credulity! Marry, I have a good mind to let you pur&s;ue your plan. When the real gho&s;t met you, I warrant you would be in a
<PB N="42" REF="43">
pretty condition! Don Alphon&s;o, you ought to be a&s;hamed of your&s;elf for &s;educing a young, ignorant creature to leave her family and friends. However, for this time, at lea&s;t, I &s;hall mar your wicked de|&s;igns. The noble lady &s;hall be informed of the whole affair, and Agnes mu&s;t defer playing the &s;pectre till a better opportunity. Farewell, Segnor.&mdash;Donna Agnes, let me have the honour of conducting your gho&s;t|&s;hip back to your apartment."</P>
<P>She approached the &s;opha on which her trembling pupil was &s;eated, took her by the hand, and prepared to lead her from the pavilion.</P>
<P>I detained her, and &s;trove by entreaties, &s;oothing, promi&s;es, and flattery to win her to my party; but, finding all that I could &s;ay of no avail, I abandoned the vain at|tempt.</P>
<P>"Your ob&s;tinacy mu&s;t be its own pu|ni&s;hment," &s;aid I; "but one re&s;ource re|mains to &s;ave Agnes and my&s;elf, and I &s;hall not he&s;itate to employ it."</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">Terrified at this menace, &s;he again en|deavoured to quit the pavilion; but I &s;eized her by the wri&s;t, and detained her forcibly. At the &s;ame moment Theodore, who had followed her into the room, clo&s;ed the door, and prevented her e&s;cape. I took the veil of Agnes; I threw it round the duenna's head, who uttered &s;uch piercing &s;hrieks that, in &s;pite of our di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle, I dreaded their being heard. At length I &s;ucceeded in gagging her &s;o com|pletely, that &s;he could not produce a &s;ingle &s;ound. Theodore and my&s;elf, with &s;ome difficulty, next contrived to bind her hands and feet with our handkerchiefs; and I ad|vi&s;ed Agnes to regain her chamber with all diligence. I promi&s;ed that no harm &s;hould happen to Cunegonda; bade her remember that, on the fifth of May, I &s;hould be in waiting at the great gate of the ca&s;tle, and took of her an affectionate farewell. Trem|bling and unea&s;y, &s;he had &s;carce power enough to &s;ignify her con&s;ent to my plans,
<PB N="44" REF="45">
and fled back to her apartment in di&s;order and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean while Theodore a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in carrying off my antiquated prize. She was hoi&s;ted over the wall, placed before me upon my hor&s;e, like a portmanteau, and I gal|loped away with her from the ca&s;tle of Lin|denberg. The unlucky duenna never had made a more di&s;agreeable journey in her life. She was jolted and &s;haken till &s;he was be|come little more than an animated mummy; not to mention her fright, when we waded through a &s;mall river, through which it was nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s in order to regain the vil|lage. Before we reached the inn, I had already determined how to di&s;po&s;e of the trouble&s;ome Cunegonda. We entered the &s;treet in which the inn &s;tood; and while the page knocked, I waited at a little di&s;tance. The landlord opened the door with a lamp in his hand.</P>
<P>"Give me the light," &s;aid Theodore, "my ma&s;ter is coming."</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">He &s;natched the lamp ha&s;tily, and pur|po&s;ely let it fall upon the ground. The landlord returned to the kitchen to re-light the lamp, leaving the door open. I pro|fited by the ob&s;curity, &s;prang from my hor&s;e with Cunegonda in my arms, darted up &s;tairs, reached my chamber unperceived, and, unlocking the door of a &s;pacious clo&s;et, &s;towed her within it, and then turned the key. The landlord and Theodore &s;oon after appeared with lights: the former ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;urpri&s;ed at my returning &s;o late, but a&s;ked no impertinent que&s;tions. He &s;oon quitted the room, and left me to exult in the &s;ucce&s;s of my undertaking.</P>
<P>I immediately paid a vi&s;it to my pri&s;oner. I &s;trove to per&s;uade her &s;ubmitting with pa|tience to her temporary confinement. My attempt was un&s;ucce&s;sful. Unable to &s;peak or move, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her fury by her looks; and, except at meals, I never dared to unbind her, or relea&s;e her from the gag. At &s;uch times I &s;tood over her with a drawn &s;word, and prote&s;ted that, if &s;he uttered a
<PB N="46" REF="47">
&s;ingle cry, I would plunge it in her bo&s;om. As &s;oon as &s;he had done eating, the gag was replaced. I was con&s;cious that this proceeding was cruel, and could only be ju&s;tified by the urgency of circum&s;tances. As to Theodore, he had no &s;cruples upon the &s;ubject. Cunegonda's captivity enter|tained him beyond mea&s;ure. During his abode in the ca&s;tle, a continual warfare had been carried on between him and the du|enna; and, now that he found his enemy &s;o ab&s;olutely in his power, he triumphed without mercy: he &s;eemed to think of no|thing but how to find out new means of plaguing her. Sometimes he affected to pity her misfortune, then laughed at, abu&s;ed, and mimicked her: he played her a thou&s;and tricks, each more provoking than the other; and amu&s;ed him&s;elf by telling her, that her elopement mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned much &s;ur|pri&s;e at the baron's. This was in fact the ca&s;e. No one, except Agnes, could ima|gine what was become of dame Cunegonda. Every hole and corner was &s;earched for her:
<PB N="47" REF="48">
the ponds were dragged, and the woods underwent a thorough examination. Still no dame Cunegonda made her appearance. Agnes kept the &s;ecret, and I kept the du|enna: the barone&s;s, therefore, remained in total ignorance re&s;pecting the old woman's fate, but &s;u&s;pected her to have peri&s;hed by &s;uicide. Thus pa&s;&s;ed away five days, during which I had prepared every thing nece&s;&s;ary for my enterpri&s;e. On quitting Agnes, I had made it my fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;patch a pea&s;ant with a letter to Lucas, at Munich, ordering him to take care that a coach and four &s;hould arrive about ten o'clock on the fifth of May at the village of Ro&s;enwald. He obeyed my in&s;tructions punctually; the equipage arrived at the time appointed. As the period of her lady's elopement drew nearer, Cunegonda's rage increa&s;ed. I verily believe, that &s;pite and pa&s;&s;ion would have killed her, had I not luckily di&s;covered her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of cherry-brandy. With this favouri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e liquor &s;he was plenti|fully &s;upplied, and, Theodore always re|maining
<PB N="48" REF="49">
to guard her, the gag was occa|&s;ionally removed. The liquor &s;eemed to have a wonderful effect in &s;oftening the acrimony of her nature; and her confine|ment not admitting of any other amu&s;ement, &s;he got drunk regularly once a-day, ju&s;t by way of pa&s;&s;ing the time.</P>
<P>The fifth of May arrived, a period by me never to be forgotten! Before the clock &s;truck twelve, I betook my&s;elf to the &s;cene of action. Theodore followed me on hor&s;eback. I concealed the carriage in a &s;pacious cavern of the hill on who&s;e brow the ca&s;tle was &s;itu|ated. This cavern was of con&s;iderable depth, and, among the pea&s;ants, was known by the name of Lindenberg Hole. The night was calm and beautiful: the moon-beams fell upon the antient towers of the ca&s;tle, and &s;hed upon their &s;ummits a &s;ilver light. All was &s;till around me: nothing was to be heard except the night-breeze &s;ighing among the leaves, the di&s;tant barking of village dogs, or the owl who had e&s;tabli&s;hed her&s;elf in a nook of the de&s;erted ea&s;tern turret. I
<PB N="49" REF="50">
heard her melancholy &s;hriek, and looked upwards: &s;he &s;at upon the ridge of a win|dow, which I recognized to be that of the haunted room. This brought to my re|membrance the &s;tory of the bleeding nun, and I &s;ighed while I reflected on the influ|ence of &s;uper&s;tition, and weakne&s;s of human rea&s;on. Suddenly I heard a faint chorus &s;teal upon the &s;ilence of the night.</P>
<P>"What can occa&s;ion that noi&s;e, Theo|dore?"</P>
<P>"A &s;tranger of di&s;tinction," replied he, "pa&s;&s;ed through the village to-day in his way to the ca&s;tle: he is reported to be the father of Donna Agnes. Doubtle&s;s the baron has given an entertainment to cele|brate his arrival."</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle bell announced the hour of midnight. This was the u&s;ual &s;ignal for the family to retire to bed. Soon after I perceived lights in the ca&s;tle, moving back|wards and forwards in different directions. I conjectured the company to be &s;eparating. I could hear the heavy doors grate as they
<PB N="50" REF="51">
opened with difficulty; and as they clo&s;ed again, the rotten ca&s;ements rattled in their frames. The chamber of Agnes was on the other &s;ide of the ca&s;tle. I trembled le&s;t &s;he &s;hould have failed in obtaining the key of the haunted room. Through this it was nece&s;|&s;ary for her to pa&s;s, in order to reach the nar|row &s;tair-ca&s;e by which the gho&s;t was &s;up|po&s;ed to de&s;cend into the great hall. Agi|tated by this apprehen&s;ion, I kept my eyes con&s;tantly fixed upon the window, where I hoped to perceive the friendly glare of a lamp borne by Agnes. I now heard the ma&s;&s;y gates unbarred. By the candle in his hand, I di&s;tingui&s;hed old Conrad, the porter. He &s;et the portal doors wide open, and retired. The lights in the ca&s;tle gradually di&s;ap|peared, and at length the whole building was wrapt in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>While I &s;at upon a broken ridge of the hill, the &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene in&s;pired me with melancholy ideas not altogether un|plea&s;ing. The ca&s;tle, which &s;tood full in my &s;ight, formed an object equally awful
<PB N="51" REF="52">
and picture&s;que. Its ponderous walls, tinged by the moon with &s;olemn brightne&s;s; its old and partly ruined towers, lifting them|&s;elves into the clouds, and &s;eeming to frown on the plains around them; its lofty battlements, overgrown with ivy; and folding gates, expanding in honour of the vi&s;ionary inhabitant, made me &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ad and reverential horror. Yet did not the&s;e &s;en&s;ations occupy me &s;o fully as to prevent me from witne&s;&s;ing with impatience the &s;low progre&s;s of time. I approached the ca&s;tle, and ventured to walk round it. A few rays of light &s;till glimmered in the chamber of Agnes. I ob&s;erved them with joy. I was &s;till gazing upon them, when I perceived a figure draw near the window, and the curtain was carefully clo&s;ed to con|ceal the lamp which burned there. Con|vinced by this ob&s;ervation that Agnes had not abandoned our plan, I returned with a light heart to my former &s;tation.</P>
<P>The half-hour &s;truck! The three-quar|ters &s;truck! My bo&s;om beat high with
<PB N="52" REF="53">
hope and expectation. At length, the wi&s;hed-for &s;ound was heard. The bell tolled "one," and the man&s;ion echoed with the noi&s;e loud and &s;olemn. I looked up to the ca&s;ement of the haunted chamber. Scarcely had five minutes elap&s;ed when the expected light appeared. I was now clo&s;e to the tower. The window was not &s;o far from the ground, but that I fancied I perceived a female figure with a lamp in her hand moving &s;lowly along the apartment. The light &s;oon faded away, and all was again dark and gloomy.</P>
<P>Occa&s;ional gleams of brightne&s;s darted from the &s;tair-ca&s;e windows as the lovely gho&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by them. I traced the light through the hall: it reached the portal; and at length I beheld Agnes pa&s;s through the folding gates. She was habited exactly as &s;he had de&s;cribed the &s;pectre. A chaplet of beads hung upon her arm; her head was enveloped in a long white veil; her nun's dre&s;s was &s;tained with blood; and &s;he had taken care to provide her&s;elf with a lamp
<PB N="53" REF="54">
and dagger. She advanced towards the &s;pot where I &s;tood. I flew to meet her, and cla&s;ped her in my arms.</P>
<P>"Agnes!" &s;aid I, while I pre&s;&s;ed her to by bo&s;om,
<Q><L>Agnes! Agnes! thou art mine!</L>
<L>Agnes! Agnes! I am thine!</L>
<L>In my veins while blood &s;hall roll,</L>
<L>Thou art mine!</L>
<L>I am thine!</L>
<L>Thine my body! thine my &s;oul!</L></Q></P>
<P>Terrified and breathle&s;s, &s;he was unable to &s;peak. She dropped her lamp and dag|ger, and &s;unk upon my bo&s;om in &s;ilence. I rai&s;ed her in my arms, and conveyed her to the carriage. Theodore remained behind in order to relea&s;e dame Cunegonda. I al&s;o charged him with a letter to the barone&s;s, explaining the whole affair, and entreating her good offices in reconciling Don Ga&s;ton to my union with his daughter. I di&s;covered to her my real name. I proved to her that my birth and expectations ju&s;tified my pre|tending to her niece; and a&s;&s;ured her,
<PB N="54" REF="55">
though it was out of my power to return her love, that I would &s;trive uncea&s;ingly to ob|tain her e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I &s;tepped into the carriage, where Agnes was already &s;eated. Theodore clo&s;ed the door, and the po&s;tillions drove away. At fir&s;t I was delighted with the rapidity of our progre&s;s; but as &s;oon as we were in no danger of pur&s;uit, I called to the drivers, and bade them moderate their pace. They &s;trove in vain to obey me; the hor&s;es refu&s;ed to an&s;wer the rein, and continued to ru&s;h on with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;wiftne&s;s. The po&s;tillions redoubled their efforts to &s;top them; but, by kicking and plunging, the bea&s;ts &s;oon relea&s;ed them&s;elves from this re&s;traint. Uttering a loud &s;hriek, the dri|vers were hurled upon the ground. Imme|diately thick clouds ob&s;cured the &s;ky: the winds howled around us, the lightning fla&s;hed, and the thunder roared tremen|dou&s;ly. Never did I behold &s;o frightful a tempe&s;t! Terrified by the jar of contending elements, the hor&s;es &s;eemed every moment
<PB N="55" REF="56">
to increa&s;e their &s;peed. Nothing could in|terrupt their career; they dragged the car|riage through hedges and ditches, da&s;hed down the mo&s;t dangerous precipices, and &s;eemed to vie in &s;wiftne&s;s with the rapidity of the winds.</P>
<P>All this while my companion lay mo|tionle&s;s in my arms. Truly alarmed by the magnitude of the danger, I was in vain at|tempting to recall her to her &s;en&s;es, when a loud cra&s;h announced that a &s;top was put to our progre&s;s in the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable man|ner. The carriage was &s;hattered to pieces. In falling, I &s;truck my temple again&s;t a flint. The pain of the wound, the violence of the &s;hock, and apprehen&s;ion for the &s;afety of Agnes, combined to overpower me &s;o completely, that my &s;en&s;es for&s;ook me, and I lay without animation on the ground.</P>
<P>I probably remained for &s;ome time in this &s;ituation, &s;ince, when I opened my eyes, it was broad day-light. Several pea&s;ants were &s;tanding round me, and &s;eemed di&s;|puting whether my recovery was po&s;&s;ible. I
<PB N="56" REF="57">
&s;poke German tolerably well. As &s;oon as I could utter an articulate &s;ound, I en|quired after Agnes. What was my &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;tre&s;s, when a&s;&s;ured by the pea&s;ants that nobody had been &s;een an&s;wering the de&s;cription which I gave of her! They told me, that in going to their daily labour they had been alarmed by ob&s;erving the fragments of my carriage, and by hearing the groans of an hor&s;e, the only one of the four which remained alive: the other three lay dead by my &s;ide. Nobody was near me when they came up, and much time had been lo&s;t before they &s;ucceeded in reco|vering me. Unea&s;y beyond expre&s;&s;ion re|&s;pecting the fate of my companion, I be|&s;ought the pea&s;ants to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves, in &s;earch of her. I de&s;cribed her dre&s;s, and promi&s;ed immen&s;e rewards to whoever brought me any intelligence. As for my|&s;elf, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to join in the pur&s;uit: I had broken two of my ribs in the fall; my arm being di&s;located hung u&s;ele&s;s by my &s;ide; and my left leg was &s;hat|tered
<PB N="57" REF="58">
&s;o terribly, that I never expected to recover its u&s;e.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants complied with my reque&s;t; all left me except four, who made a litter of boughs, and prepared to convey me to the neighbouring town. I enquired its name: it proved to be Rati&s;bon, and I could &s;carcely per&s;uade my&s;elf that I had travelled to &s;uch a di&s;tance in a &s;ingle night. I told the countrymen, that at one o'clock that morning I had pa&s;&s;ed through the village of Ro&s;enwald. They &s;hook their heads wi&s;tfully, and made &s;igns to each other that I mu&s;t certainly be delirious. I was con|veyed to a decent inn, and immediately put to bed. A phy&s;ician was &s;ent for, who &s;et my arm with &s;ucce&s;s: he then examined my other hurts, and told me that I need be under no apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences of any of them, but ordered me to keep my&s;elf quiet, and be prepared for a tedious and painful cure. I an&s;wered him, that if he hoped to keep me quiet, he mu&s;t fir&s;t endeavour to procure me &s;ome news of a
<PB N="58" REF="59">
lady who had quitted Ro&s;enwald in my company the night before, and had been with me at the moment when the coach broke down. He &s;miled, and only replied by advi&s;ing me to make my&s;elf ea&s;y, for that all proper care &s;hould be taken of me. As he quitted me, the ho&s;te&s;s met him at the door of the room.</P>
<P>"The gentleman is not quite in his right &s;en&s;es," I heard him fay to her in a low voice; "'tis the natural con&s;equence of his fall, but that will &s;oon be over."</P>
<P>One after another the pea&s;ants returned to the inn, and informed me that no traces had been di&s;covered of my unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s. Unea&s;ine&s;s now became de&s;pair. I entreated them to renew their &s;earch in the mo&s;t urgent terms, doubling the pro|mi&s;es which I had already made them. My wild and frantic manner confirmed the by-&s;tanders in the idea of my being delirious. No &s;igns of the lady having ap|peared, they believed her to be a creature fabricated by my over-heated brain, and
<PB N="59" REF="60">
paid no attention to my entreaties. How|ever, the ho&s;te&s;s a&s;&s;ured me, that a fre&s;h en|quiry &s;hould be made; but I found after|wards that her promi&s;e was only given to quiet me. No further &s;teps were taken in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Though my baggage was left at Munich under the care of my French &s;ervant, hav|ing prepared my&s;elf for a long journey, my pur&s;e was amply furni&s;hed: be&s;ides, my equipage proved me to be of di&s;tinction, and in con&s;equence all po&s;&s;ible attention was paid me at the inn. The day pa&s;&s;ed away: &s;till no news arrived of Agnes. The anxiety of fear now gave place to de&s;pon|dency. I cea&s;ed to rave about her, and was plunged in the depth of melancholy reflec|tions. Perceiving me to be &s;ilent and tran|quil, my attendants believed my delirium to have abated, and that my malady had taken a favourable turn. According to the phy&s;ician's order, I &s;wallowed a com|po&s;ing medicine; and as &s;oon as the night
<PB N="60" REF="61">
&s;hut in, my attendants withdrew, and left me to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>That repo&s;e I wooed in vain. The agi|tation of my bo&s;om cha&s;ed away &s;leep. Re&s;tle&s;s in my mind, in &s;pite of the fatigue of my body, I continued to to&s;s about from &s;ide to &s;ide, till the clock in a neighbouring &s;teeple &s;truck "one." As I li&s;tened to the mournful hollow &s;ound, and heard it die away in the wind, I felt a &s;udden chillne&s;s &s;pread it&s;elf over my body. I &s;huddered without knowing wherefore; cold dews poured down my forehead, and my hair &s;tood bri&s;tling with alarm. Suddenly I heard &s;low and heavy &s;teps a&s;cending the &s;tair-ca&s;e. By an involuntary movement I &s;tarted up in my bed, and drew back the curtain. A &s;ingle ru&s;h-light, which glim|mered upon the hearth, &s;hed a faint gleam through the apartment, which was hung with tape&s;try. The door was thrown open with violence. A figure entered, and drew near my bed with &s;olemn mea&s;ured &s;teps.
<PB N="61" REF="62">
With trembling apprehen&s;ion I examined this midnight vi&s;itor. God Almighty! it was the bleeding nun! It was my lo&s;t com|panion! Her face was &s;till veiled, but &s;he no longer held her lamp and dagger. She lifted up her veil &s;lowly. What a &s;ight pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my &s;tartled eyes! I be|held before me an animated cor&s;e. Her countenance was long and haggard; her cheeks and lips were bloodle&s;s; the pale|ne&s;s of death was &s;pread over her fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ures; and her eye-balls, fixed &s;tedfa&s;tly upon me, were lu&s;trele&s;s and hollow.</P>
<P>I gazed upon the &s;pectre with horror too great to be de&s;cribed. My blood was frozen in my veins. I would have called for aid, but the &s;ound expired ere it could pa&s;s my lips. My nerves were bound up in impotence, and I remained in the &s;ame at|titude inanimate as a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>The vi&s;ionary nun looked upon me for &s;ome minutes in &s;ilence: there was &s;ome|thing petrifying in her regard. At length,
<PB N="62" REF="63">
in a low &s;epulchral voice, &s;he pronounced the following words:
<Q><L>Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</L>
<L>Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!</L>
<L>In thy veins while blood &s;hall roll,</L>
<L>I am thine!</L>
<L>Thou art mine!</L>
<L>Mine thy body! Mine thy &s;oul!&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Breathle&s;s with fear, I li&s;tened while &s;he repeated my own expre&s;&s;ions. The appa|rition &s;eated her&s;elf oppo&s;ite to me at the foot of the bed, and was &s;ilent. Her eyes were fixed earne&s;tly upon mine: they &s;eem|ed endowed with the property of the rattle|&s;nake's, for I &s;trove in vain to look off her. My eyes were fa&s;cinated, and I had not the power of withdrawing them from the &s;pectre's.</P>
<P>In this attitude &s;he remained for a whole long hour without &s;peaking or moving; nor was I able to do either. At length the clock &s;truck two. The apparition ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and approached the &s;ide of the bed. She gra&s;ped with her icy fingers
<PB N="63" REF="64">
my hand, which hung lifele&s;s upon the co|verture, and, pre&s;&s;ing her cold lips to mine, again repeated,
<Q><L>Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</L>
<L>Raymond! Raymond! I am thine! &amp;c.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>She then dropped my hand, quitted the chamber with &s;low &s;teps, and the door clo&s;ed after her. Till that moment the faculties of my body had been all &s;u&s;pend|ed; tho&s;e of my mind had alone been wak|ing. The charm now cea&s;ed to operate; the blood which had been frozen in my veins ru&s;hed back to my heart with vio|lence; I uttered a deep groan, and &s;unk lifele&s;s upon my pillow.</P>
<P>The adjoining room was only &s;eparated from mine by a thin partition; it was occu|pied by the ho&s;t and his wife: the former was rou&s;ed by my groan, and immediately ha&s;tened to my chamber; the ho&s;te&s;s &s;oon followed him. With &s;ome difficulty they &s;ucceeded in re&s;toring me to my &s;en&s;es, and immediately &s;ent for the phy&s;ician, who arrived in all diligence. He declared
<PB N="64" REF="65">
my fever to be very much increa&s;ed, and that, if I continued to &s;uffer &s;uch violent agi|tation, he would not take upon him to en|&s;ure my life. Some medicines which he gave me, in &s;ome degree tranquillized my &s;pirits. I fell into a &s;ort of &s;lumber towards day-break, but fearful dreams prevented me from deriving any benefit from my repo&s;e. Agnes and the bleeding nun pre&s;ented them&s;elves by turns to my fancy, and com|bined to hara&s;s and torment me. I awoke fatigued and unrefre&s;hed. My fever &s;eem|ed rather augmented than dimini&s;hed; the agitation of my mind impeded my fractured bones from knitting: I had frequent faint|ing fits, and during the whole day the phy|&s;ician judged it expedient not to quit me for two hours together.</P>
<P>The &s;ingularity of my adventure made me determine to conceal it from every one, &s;ince I could not expect that a circum&s;tance &s;o &s;trange &s;hould gain credit. I was very unea&s;y about Agnes. I knew not what &s;he would think at not finding me at the ren|dezvous,
<PB N="65" REF="66">
and dreaded her entertaining &s;u&s;picions of my fidelity. However, I de|pended upon Theodore's di&s;cretion, and tru&s;ted that my letter to the barone&s;s would convince her of the rectitude of my intentions. The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;omewhat lightened my inquietude upon her account; but the impre&s;&s;ion left upon my mind by my nocturnal vi&s;itor, grew &s;tronger with every &s;ucceeding moment. The night drew near; I dreaded its arrival; yet I &s;trove to per&s;uade my&s;elf that the gho&s;t would ap|pear no more, and at all events I de&s;ired that a &s;ervant might &s;it up in my chamber.</P>
<P>The fatigue of my body, from not hav|ing &s;lept on the former night, co-operating with the &s;trong opiates admini&s;tered to me in profu&s;ion, at length procured me that repo&s;e of which I was &s;o much in need. I &s;unk into a profound and tranquil &s;lumber, and had already &s;lept for &s;ome hours, when the neighbouring clock rou&s;ed me by &s;triking "one."

before. The &s;ame cold &s;hivering &s;eized me. I &s;tarted up in my bed, and perceived the &s;ervant fa&s;t a&s;leep in an arm-chair near me. I called him by his name: he made no an&s;wer. I &s;hook him forcibly by the arm, and &s;trove in vain to wake him: he was perfectly in&s;en&s;ible to my efforts. I now heard the heavy &s;teps a&s;cending the &s;tair-ca&s;e; the door was thrown open, and again the bleeding nun &s;tood before me. Once more my limbs were chained in &s;econd infancy: once more I heard tho&s;e fatal words repeated,
<Q><L>Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</L>
<L>Raymond! Raymond! I am thine! &amp;c.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;cene which had &s;hocked me &s;o &s;en&s;ibly on the former night, was again pre|&s;ented. The &s;pectre again pre&s;&s;ed her lips to mine, again touched me with her rot|ting fingers, and, as on her fir&s;t appearance, quitted the chamber as &s;oon as the clock told "two."</P>
<P>Every night was this repeated. Far from growing accu&s;tomed to the gho&s;t,
<PB N="67" REF="68">
every &s;ucceeding vi&s;it in&s;pired me with greater horror. Her idea pur&s;ued me con|tinually, and I became the prey of habitual melancholy. The con&s;tant agitation of my mind naturally retarded the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of my health. Several months elap&s;ed before I was able to quit my bed; and when, at length, I was moved to a &s;o|pha, I was &s;o faint, &s;piritle&s;s, and emaciated, that I could not cro&s;s the room without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The looks of my attendants &s;uf|ficiently denoted the little hope which they entertained of my recovery. The profound &s;adne&s;s which oppre&s;&s;ed me without remi&s;|&s;ion, made the phy&s;ician con&s;ider me to be an hypochondriac. The cau&s;e of my di&s;|tre&s;s I carefully concealed in my own bo|&s;om, for I knew that no one could give me relief. The gho&s;t was not even vi&s;ible to any eye but mine. I had frequently cau&s;ed attendants to &s;it up in my room; but the moment that the clock &s;truck "one," ir|re&s;i&s;tible &s;lumber &s;eized them, nor left them till the departure of the gho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">You may be &s;urpri&s;ed that during this time I made no enquiries after your &s;i&s;ter. Theodore, who with difficulty had di&s;co|vered my abode, had quieted my appre|hen&s;ions for her &s;afety; at the &s;ame time he convinced me, that all attempts to re|lea&s;e her from captivity mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s, till I &s;hould be in a condition to return to Spain. The particulars of her adventure, which I &s;hall now relate to you, were partly communicated to me by Theodore, and partly by Agnes her&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the fatal night when her elopement was to have taken place, accident had not permitted her to quit her chamber at the appointed time. At length &s;he ventured into the haunted room, de&s;cended the &s;tair|ca&s;e leading into the hall, found the gates open as &s;he expected, and left the ca&s;tle unob&s;erved. What was her &s;urpri&s;e at not finding me ready to receive her! She ex|amined the cavern, ranged through every alley of the neighbour|ing wood, and pa&s;&s;ed two full hours in this fruitle&s;s enquiry. She
<PB N="69" REF="70">
could di&s;cover no traces either of me or of the carriage. Alarmed and di&s;appointed, her only re&s;ource was to return to the ca&s;tle before the barone&s;s mi&s;&s;ed her; but here &s;he found her&s;elf in a fre&s;h embarra&s;&s;ment. The bell had already tolled "two," the gho&s;tly hour was pa&s;t, and the careful por|ter had locked the folding gates. After much irre&s;olution, &s;he ventured to knock &s;oftly. Luckily for her, Conrad was &s;till awake: he heard the noi&s;e, and ro&s;e, mur|muring at being called up a &s;econd time. No &s;ooner had he opened one of the doors, and beheld the &s;uppo&s;ed apparition wait|ing there for admittance, than he uttered a loud cry, and &s;unk upon his knees. Agnes profited by his terror: &s;he glided by him, flew to her own apartment, and, having thrown off her &s;pectre's trappings, retired to bed, endeavouring in vain to account for my di&s;appearing.</P>
<P>In the mean while, Theodore having &s;een my carriage drive off with the fal&s;e Agnes, returned joyfully to the village.
<PB N="70" REF="71">
The next morning he relea&s;ed Cunegonda from her confinement, and accompanied her to the ca&s;tle. There he found the baron, his lady, and Don Ga&s;ton, di&s;put|ing together upon the porter's relation. All of them agreed in believing the exi&s;t|ence of &s;pectres; but the latter contended, that for a gho&s;t to knock for admittance was a proceeding till then unwitne&s;&s;ed, and totally incompatible with the immaterial nature of a &s;pirit. They were &s;till di&s;cu&s;|&s;ing the &s;ubject, when the page appeared with Cunegonda, and cleared up the my&s;|tery. On hearing his depo&s;ition, it was agreed unanimou&s;ly, that the Agnes whom Theodore had &s;een &s;tep into my carriage mu&s;t have been the bleeding nun, and that the gho&s;t who had terrified Conrad was no other than Don Ga&s;ton's daughter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e which this di&s;covery occa&s;ioned being over, the barone&s;s re|&s;olved to make it of u&s;e in per&s;uading her niece to take the veil. Fearing le&s;t &s;o ad|vantageous an e&s;tabli&s;hment for his daugh|ter

&s;hould induce Don Ga&s;ton to renounce his re&s;olution, &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my letter, and continued to repre&s;ent me as a needy unknown adventurer. A childi&s;h vanity had led me to conceal my real name even from my mi&s;tre&s;s; I wi&s;hed to be loved for my|&s;elf, not for being the &s;on and heir of the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas. The con&s;e|quence was, that my rank was known to no one in the ca&s;tle except the barone&s;s, and &s;he took good care to confine the know|ledge to her own brea&s;t. Don Ga&s;ton having approved his &s;i&s;ter's de&s;ign, Agnes was &s;ummoned to appear before them. She was taxed with having meditated an elope|ment, obliged to make a full confe&s;&s;ion, and was amazed at the gentlene&s;s with which it was received: but what was her affliction, when informed that the failure of her project mu&s;t be attributed to me! Cunegonda, tutored by the barone&s;s, told her, that when I relea&s;ed her I had de&s;ired her to inform her lady that our connexion was at an end, that the whole affair was oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="72" REF="73">
by a fal&s;e report, and that it by no means &s;uited my circum&s;tances to marry a woman without fortune or expectations.</P>
<P>To this account my &s;udden di&s;appearing gave but too great an air of probability. Theodore, who could have contradicted the &s;tory, by Donna Rodolpha's order was kept out of her &s;ight. What proved a &s;till greater confirmation of my being an impo&s;|tor, was the arrival of a letter from your&s;elf, declaring that you had no &s;ort of acquaint|ance with Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada. The&s;e &s;eeming proofs of my perfidy, aided by the artful in&s;inuations of her aunt, by Cune|gonda's flattery, and her father's threats and anger, entirely conquered your &s;i&s;ter's re|pugnance to a convent. Incen&s;ed at my behaviour, and di&s;gu&s;ted with the world in general, &s;he con&s;ented to receive the veil. She pa&s;&s;ed another month at the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg, during which my non-appear|ance confirmed her in her re&s;olution, and then accompanied Don Ga&s;ton into Spain. Theodore was now &s;et at liberty. He
<PB N="73" REF="74">
ha&s;tened to Munich, where I had promi&s;ed to let him hear from me; but finding from Lucas that I never arrived there, he pur|&s;ued his &s;earch with indefatigable per&s;e|verance, and at length &s;ucceeded in rejoin|ing me at Rati&s;bon.</P>
<P>So much was I altered, that &s;carcely could he recollect my features: the di&s;|tre&s;s vi&s;ible upon his, &s;ufficiently te&s;tified how lively was the intere&s;t which he felt for me. The &s;ociety of this amiable boy, whom I had always con&s;idered rather as a companion than a &s;ervant, was now my only comfort. His conver&s;ation was gay, yet &s;en&s;ible, and his ob&s;ervations &s;hrewd and entertaining. He had picked up much more knowledge than is u&s;ual at his age; but what rendered him mo&s;t agreeable to me, was his having a delightful voice, and &s;ome &s;kill in mu&s;ic. He had al&s;o acquired &s;ome ta&s;te in poetry, and even ventured &s;ome|times to write ver&s;es him&s;elf. He occa|&s;ionally compo&s;ed little ballads in Spani&s;h. His compo&s;itions were but indifferent, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, yet they were plea&s;ing to me
<PB N="74" REF="75">
from their novelty; and hearing him &s;ing them to his guitar was the only amu&s;e|ment which I was capable of receiving. Theodore perceived well enough that &s;omething preyed upon my mind; but as I concealed the cau&s;e of my grief even from him, re&s;pect would not permit him to pry into my &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>One evening I was lying upon my &s;opha, plunged in reflections very far from agree|able: Theodore amu&s;ed him&s;elf by ob&s;erv|ing from the window a battle between two po&s;tillions, who were quarrelling in the inn-yard.</P>
<P>"Ha! ha!" cried he, &s;uddenly, "yonder is the Great Mogul."</P>
<P>"Who?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Only a man who made me a &s;trange &s;peech at Munich."</P>
<P>"What was the purport of it?"</P>
<P>"Now you put me in mind of it, Seg|nor, it was a kind of me&s;&s;age to you, but truly it was not worth delivering. I be|lieve the fellow to be mad, for my part. When I came to Munich in &s;earch of you,
<PB N="75" REF="76">
I found him living at "the King of the Romans," and the ho&s;t gave me an odd account of him. By his accent he is &s;up|po&s;ed to be a foreigner, but of what country nobody can tell. He &s;eemed to have no acquaintance in the town, &s;poke very &s;el|dom, and never was &s;een to &s;mile. He had neither &s;ervants nor baggage; but his pur&s;e &s;eemed well furni&s;hed, and he did much good in the town. Some &s;uppo&s;ed him to be an Arabian a&s;trologer, others to be a travelling mountebank, and many de|clared that he was Doctor Fau&s;tus, whom the devil had &s;ent back to Germany. The landlord, however, told me, that he had the be&s;t rea&s;ons to believe him to be the Great Mogul incognito."</P>
<P>"But the &s;trange &s;peech, Theodore&mdash;"</P>
<P>"True, I had almo&s;t forgotten the &s;peech: indeed, for that matter, it would not have been a great lo&s;s if I had forgotten it altogether. You are to know, Segnor, that while I was enquiring about you of the landlord, this &s;tranger pa&s;&s;ed by. He &s;top|ped,
<PB N="76" REF="77">
and looked at me earne&s;tly&mdash;"Youth," &s;aid he, in a &s;olemn voice, "he whom you &s;eek, has found that which he would fain lo&s;e. My hand alone can dry up the blood. Bid your ma&s;ter wi&s;h for me when the clock &s;trikes "one."</P>
<P>"How?" cried I, &s;tarting from my &s;o|pha. [The words which Theodore had repeated, &s;eemed to imply the &s;tranger's knowledge of my &s;ecret] "Fly to him, my boy! Entreat him to grant me one mo|ment's conver&s;ation,"</P>
<P>Theodore was &s;urpri&s;ed at the vivacity of my manner: however, he a&s;ked no que&s;tions, but ha&s;tened to obey me. I waited his return impatiently. But a &s;hort &s;pace of time had elap&s;ed, when he again appeared, and u&s;hered the expected gue&s;t into my chamber. He was a man of ma|je&s;tic pre&s;ence; his countenance was &s;trong|ly marked, and his eyes were large, black, and &s;parkling: yet there was a &s;omething in his look, which, the moment that I &s;aw him, in&s;pired me with a &s;ecret awe, not to
<PB N="77" REF="78">
&s;ay horror. He was dre&s;&s;ed plainly, his hair was unpowdered, and a band of black vel|vet which encircled his forehead, &s;pread over his features an additional gloom. His countenance wore the marks of profound melancholy, his &s;tep was &s;low, and his manner grave, &s;tately, and &s;olemn.</P>
<P>He &s;aluted me with politene&s;s; and hav|ing replied to the u&s;ual compliments of in|troduction, he motioned to Theodore to quit the chamber. The page in&s;tantly withdrew.</P>
<P>"I know your bu&s;ine&s;s," &s;aid he, with|out giving me time to &s;peak. "I have the power of relea&s;ing you from your nightly vi&s;itor; but this cannot be done before Sunday. On the hour when the &s;abbath morning breaks, &s;pirits of darkne&s;s have lea&s;t influence over mortals. After Satur|day the nun &s;hall vi&s;it you no more."</P>
<P>"May I not enquire," &s;aid I, "by what means you are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret, which I have carefully concealed from the knowledge of every one?"</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">"How can I be ignorant of your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, when their cau&s;e at this moment &s;tands be|&s;ide you?"</P>
<P>I &s;tarted. The &s;tranger continued.</P>
<P>"Though to you only vi&s;ible for one hour in the twenty-four, neither day nor night does &s;he ever quit you; nor will &s;he ever quit you till you have granted her re|que&s;t."</P>
<P>"And what is that reque&s;t?"</P>
<P>"That &s;he mu&s;t her&s;elf explain: it lies not in my knowledge. Wait with patience for the night of Saturday: all &s;hall be then cleared up."</P>
<P>I dared not pre&s;s him further. He &s;oon after changed the conver&s;ation, and talked of various matters. He named people who had cea&s;ed to exi&s;t for many centuries, and yet with whom he appeared to have been per&s;onally acquainted. I could not men|tion a country, however di&s;tant, which he had not vi&s;ited, nor could I &s;ufficiently admire the extent and variety of his infor|mation. I remarked to him, that having
<PB N="79" REF="80">
travelled, &s;een and known &s;o much, mu&s;t have given him infinite plea&s;ure. He &s;hook his head mournfully.</P>
<P>"No one," he replied, "is adequate to comprehending the mi&s;ery of my lot! Fate obliges me to be con&s;tantly in move|ment; I am not permitted to pa&s;s more than a fortnight in the &s;ame place. I have no friend in the world, and, from the re&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s of my de&s;tiny, I never can acquire one. Fain would I lay down my mi&s;erable life, for I envy tho&s;e who enjoy the quiet of the grave: but death eludes me, and flies from my embrace. In vain do I throw my&s;elf in the way of danger. I plunge into the ocean; the waves throw me back with ab|horrence upon the &s;hore: I ru&s;h into fire; the flames recoil at my approach: I oppo&s;e my&s;elf to the fury of banditti; their &s;words become blunted, and break again&s;t my brea&s;t. The hungry tiger &s;hudders at my approach, and the alligator flies from a mon&s;ter more horrible than it&s;elf. God

has &s;et his &s;eal upon me, and all his crea|tures re&s;pect this fatal m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rk."</P>
<P>He put his hand to the velvet, which was bound round his forehead. There was in his eyes an expre&s;&s;ion of fury, de|&s;pair, and malevolence, that &s;truck horror to my very &s;oul. An involuntary convul&s;ion made me &s;hudder. The &s;tranger perceived it.</P>
<P>"Such is the cur&s;e impo&s;ed on me," he continued: "I am doomed to in&s;pire all who look on me with terror and dete&s;ta|tion. You already feel the influence of the charm, and with every &s;ucceeding mo|ment will feel it more. I will not add to your &s;ufferings by my pre&s;ence. Farewell till Saturday. As &s;oon as the clock &s;trikes twelve, expect me at your chamber-door."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this he departed, leaving me in a&s;toni&s;hment at the my&s;terious turn of his manner and conver&s;ation. His a&s;&s;u|rances that I &s;hould &s;oon be relieved from the apparition's vi&s;its, produced a good effect upon my con&s;titution. Theodore,
<PB N="81" REF="82">
whom I rather treated as an adopted child than a dome&s;tic, was &s;urpri&s;ed at his return to ob&s;erve the amendment in my looks. He congratulated me on this &s;ymptom of returning health, and declared him&s;elf de|lighted at my having received &s;o much be|nefit from my conference with the Great Mogul. Upon enquiry I found that the &s;tranger had already pa&s;&s;ed eight days in Rati&s;bon. According to his own account, therefore, he was only to remain there &s;ix days longer. Saturday was &s;till at the di&s;tance of three. Oh! with what impa|tience did I expect its arrival! In the in|terim, the bleeding nun continued her noc|turnal vi&s;its; but hoping &s;oon to be relea&s;ed from them altogether, the effects which they produced on me became le&s;s vio|lent than before.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed for night arrived. To avoid creating &s;u&s;picion I retired to bed at my u&s;ual hour. But as &s;oon as my attendants had left me, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf again, and prepared for the &s;tranger's reception. He
<PB N="82" REF="83">
entered my room upon the turn of mid night. A &s;mall che&s;t was in his hand, which he placed near the &s;tove. He &s;aluted me without &s;peaking; I returned the compli|ment, ob&s;erving an equal &s;ilence. He then opened his che&s;t. The fir&s;t thing which he produced was a &s;mall wooden crucifix: he &s;unk upon his knees, gazed upon it mournfully, and ca&s;t his eyes to|wards heaven. He &s;eemed to be praying devoutly. At length he bowed his head re&s;pectfully, ki&s;&s;ed the crucifix thrice, and quitted his kneeling po&s;ture. He next drew from the che&s;t a covered goblet: with the liquor which it contained, and which appeared to be blood, he &s;prinkled the floor; and then dipping in it one end of the crucifix, he de&s;cribed a circle in the middle of the room. Round about this he placed various reliques, &s;culls, thigh-bones, &amp;c. I ob&s;erved, that he di&s;po&s;ed them all in the forms of cro&s;&s;es. La&s;tly, he took out a large bible, and beckoned me to follow him into the circle. I obeyed.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">"Be cautious not to utter a &s;yllable!" whi&s;pered the &s;tranger: "&s;tep not out of the circle, and as you love your&s;elf, dare not to look upon my face!"</P>
<P>Holding the crucifix in one hand, the bible in the other, he &s;eemed to read with profound attention. The clock &s;truck one! As u&s;ual I heard the &s;pectre's &s;teps upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e: but I was not &s;eized with the accu&s;tomed &s;hivering. I waited her ap|proach with confidence. She entered the room, drew near the circle, and &s;topped. The &s;tranger muttered &s;ome words, to me unintelligible. Then rai&s;ing his head from the book, and extending the crucifix to|wards the gho&s;t, he pronounced, in a voice di&s;tinct and &s;olemn,</P>
<P>"Beatrice! Beatrice! Beatrice!"</P>
<P>"What would&s;t thou?" replied the ap|parition in a hollow faltering tone.</P>
<P>"What di&s;turbs thy &s;leep? Why do&s;t thou afflict and torture this youth? How can re&s;t be re&s;tored to thy unquiet &s;pirit?"</P>
<P>"I dare not tell! I mu&s;t not tell! Fain
<PB N="84" REF="85">
would I repo&s;e in my grave, but &s;tern com|mands force me to prolong my puni&s;h+ment!"</P>
<P>"Knowe&s;t thou this blood? Knowe&s;t thou in who&s;e veins it flowed? Beatrice! Beatrice! In his name, I charge thee to an&s;wer me."</P>
<P>"I dare not di&s;obey my ta&s;kers."</P>
<P>"Dare&s;t thou di&s;obey me?"</P>
<P>He &s;poke in a commanding tone, and drew the &s;able band from his forehead. In &s;pite of his injunctions to the contrary, curio&s;ity would not &s;uffer me to keep my eyes off his face: I rai&s;ed them, and beheld a burning cro&s;s impre&s;&s;ed upon his brow. For the horror with which this object in|&s;pired me I cannot account, but I never felt its equal. My &s;en&s;es left me for &s;ome moments: a my&s;terious dread overcame my courage; and had not the exorci&s;er caught my hand, I &s;hould have fallen out of the circle.</P>
<P>When I recovered my&s;elf, I perceived that the burning cro&s;s had produced an
<PB N="85" REF="86">
effect no le&s;s violent upon the &s;pectre. Her countenance expre&s;&s;ed reverence and hor|ror, and her vi&s;ionary limbs were &s;haken by fear.</P>
<P>"Yes!" &s;he &s;aid at length, "I tremble at that mark! I re&s;pect it! I obey you! Know then, that my bones lie &s;till unbu|ried: they rot in the ob&s;curity of Linden|berg Hole. None but this youth has the right of con&s;igning them to the grave. His own lips have made over to me his body and his &s;oul: never will I give back his promi&s;e, never &s;hall he know a night devoid of terror, unle&s;s he engages to col|lect my mouldering bones, and depo&s;it them in the family vault of his Andalu&s;ian ca&s;tle. Then let thirty ma&s;&s;es be &s;aid for the repo&s;e of my &s;pirit, and I trouble this world no more. Now let me depart. Tho&s;e flames are &s;corching!"</P>
<P>He let the hand drop &s;lowly which held the crucifix, and which till then he had pointed towards her. The apparition bow|ed her head, and her form melted into
<PB N="86" REF="87">
air. The exorci&s;er led me out of the cir|cle. He replaced the bible, &amp;c. in the che&s;t, and then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, who &s;tood near him &s;peechle&s;s from a&s;to|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"Don Raymond, you have heard the conditions on which repo&s;e is promi&s;ed you. Be it your bu&s;ine&s;s to fulfil them to the letter. For me, nothing more remains than to clear up the darkne&s;s &s;till &s;pread over the &s;pectre's hi&s;tory, and inform you, that when living Beatrice bore the name of las Ci&s;ternas. She was the great aunt of your grandfather. In quality of your re|lation, her a&s;hes demand re&s;pect from you, though the enormity of her crimes mu&s;t excite your abhorrence. The nature of tho&s;e crimes no one is more capable of ex|plaining to you than my&s;elf. I was per|&s;onally acquainted with the holy man who pro&s;cribed her nocturnal riots in the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg, and I hold this narrative from his own lips.</P>
<P>"Beatrice de las Ci&s;ternas took the veil
<PB N="87" REF="88">
at an early age, not by her own choice, but at the expre&s;s command of her parents. She was then too young to regret the plea|&s;ures of which her profe&s;&s;ion deprived her: but no &s;ooner did her warm and voluptuous character begin to be developed, than &s;he abandoned her&s;elf freely to the impul&s;e of her pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;eized the fir&s;t opportu|nity to procure their gratification. This opportunity was at length pre&s;ented, after many ob&s;tacles which only added new force to her de&s;ires. She contrived to elope from the convent, and fled to Germany with the baron Lindenberg. She lived at his ca&s;tle &s;everal months as his avowed concubine. All Bavaria was &s;candalized by her impudent and abandoned conduct. Her fea&s;ts vied in luxury with Cleopatra's, and Lindenberg became the theatre of the mo&s;t unbridled debauchery. Not &s;atisfied with di&s;playing the incontinence of a pro&s;ti|tute, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf an athei&s;t: &s;he took every opportunity to &s;coff at her mo|na&s;tic
<PB N="88" REF="89">
vows, and loaded with ridicule the mo&s;t &s;acred ceremonies of religion.</P>
<P>"Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a character &s;o depraved, &s;he did not long confine her affections to one object. Soon after her arrival at the ca&s;tle, the baron's younger brother attracted her notice by his &s;trong-marked features, gigantic &s;tature, and herculean limbs. She was not of an humour to keep her inclina|tions long unknown: but &s;he found in Otto von Lindenberg her equal in depravity. He returned her pa&s;&s;ion ju&s;t &s;ufficiently to increa&s;e it; and when he had worked it up to the de&s;ired pitch, he fixed the price of his love at his brother's murder. The wretch con&s;ented to this horrible agreement. A night was pitched upon for perpetrating the deed. Otto, who re&s;ided on a &s;mall e&s;tate a few miles di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle, promi&s;ed that, at one in the morning, he would be waiting for her at Lindenberg-hole; that he would bring with him a party of cho&s;en friends, by who&s;e aid he doubted not being
<PB N="89" REF="90">
to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle; and that his next &s;tep &s;hould be the uniting her hand to his. It was this la&s;t promi&s;e which over-ruled every &s;cruple of Beatrice, &s;ince, in &s;pite of his affection for her, the baron had declared po&s;itively, that he never would make her his wife.</P>
<P>"The fatal night arrived. The baron &s;lept in the arms of his perfidious mi&s;tre&s;s, when the ca&s;tle bell &s;truck "one." Im|mediately Beatrice drew a dagger from un|derneath her pillow, and plunged it in her paramour's heart. The baron uttered a &s;ingle dreadful groan, and expired. The murdere&s;s quitted her bed ha&s;tily, took a lamp in one hand, in the other the bloody dagger, and bent her cour&s;e towards the cavern. The porter dared not to refu&s;e opening the gates to one more dreaded in the ca&s;tle than its ma&s;ter. Beatrice reached Lindenberg-hole unoppo&s;ed, where, ac|cording to promi&s;e, &s;he found Otto waiting for her. He received, and li&s;tened to her narrative with tran&s;port: but ere &s;he had
<PB N="90" REF="91">
time to a&s;k why he came unaccompanied, he convinced her that he wi&s;hed for no wit|ne&s;&s;es to their interview. Anxious to con|ceal his &s;hare in the murder, and to free him&s;elf from a woman who&s;e violent and atrocious character made him tremble with rea&s;on for his own &s;afety, he had re&s;olved on the de&s;truction of his wretched agent. Ru&s;hing upon her &s;uddenly, he wre&s;ted the dagger from her hand. He plunged it, &s;till reeking with his brother's blood, in her bo|&s;om, and put an end to her exi&s;tence by re|peated blows.</P>
<P>"Otto now &s;ucceeded to the barony of Lindenberg. The murder was attributed &s;ole|ly to the fugitive nun, and no one &s;u&s;pected him to have per&s;uaded her to the action. But though his crime was unpuni&s;hed by man, God's ju&s;tice permitted him not to enjoy in peace his blood-&s;tained honours. Her bones lying &s;till unburied in the cave, the re&s;tle&s;s &s;oul of Beatrice continued to in|habit the ca&s;tle. Dre&s;&s;ed in her religious habit, in memory of her vows broken to
<PB N="91" REF="92">
heaven, furni&s;hed with the dagger which had drunk the blood of her paramour, and holding the lamp which had guided her &s;lying &s;teps, every night did &s;he &s;tand be|fore the bed of Otto. The mo&s;t dreadful confu&s;ion reigned through the ca&s;tle. The vaulted chambers re&s;ounded with &s;hrieks and groans; and the &s;pectre, as &s;he ranged along the antique galleries, uttered an inco|herent mixture of prayers and bla&s;phemies. Otto was unable to with&s;tand the &s;hock which he felt at this fearful vi&s;ion: its hor|rors increa&s;ed with every &s;ucceeding ap|pearance. His alarm at length became &s;o in&s;upportable, that his heart bur&s;t, and one morning he was found in his bed totally deprived of warmth and animation. His death did not put an end to the nocturnal riots. The bones of Beatrice continued to lie unburied, and her gho&s;t continued to haunt the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"The domains of Lindenberg now fell to a di&s;tant relation. But terrified by the ac|counts given him of the bleeding nun [&s;o
<PB N="92" REF="93">
was the &s;pectre called by the multitude] the new baron called to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance a ce|lebrated exorci&s;er. This holy man &s;uc|ceeded in obliging her to temporary re|po&s;e: but though &s;he di&s;covered to him her hi&s;tory, he was not permitted to reveal it to others, or cau&s;e her &s;keleton to be re|moved to hallowed ground. That office was re&s;erved for you; and till your coming her gho&s;t was doomed to wander about the ca&s;tle, and lament the crime which &s;he had there committed. However, the exorci&s;er obliged her to &s;ilence during his life-time. So long as he exi&s;ted, the haunted chamber was &s;hut up, and the &s;pectre was invi&s;ible. At his death, which happened in five years after, &s;he again appeared, but only once on every fifth year, on the &s;ame day and at the &s;ame hour when &s;he plunged her knife in the heart of her &s;leeping lover: &s;he then vi&s;ited the cavern which held her moulder|ing &s;keleton, returned to the ca&s;tle as &s;oon as the clock &s;truck two, and was &s;een no more till the next five years had elap&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">"She was doomed to &s;uffer during the &s;pace of a century. That period is pa&s;t. Nothing now remains but to con&s;ign to the grave the a&s;hes of Beatrice.

At length, overcome by my entreaties, he con&s;ented to clear up the whole, on condition that I would defer his explanation till the next day. With this reque&s;t was obliged to comply, and he left me. In the morning my fir&s;t care was to enquire after the my&s;terious &s;tranger. Conceive my di&s;appointment, when in|formed that he had already quitted Rati&s;|bon. I di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers in pur&s;uit of him, but in vain. No traces of the fugitive were di&s;covered. Since that moment I ne|ver have heard any more of him, and 'tis mo&s;t probable that I never &s;hall."</P>
<P>[Lorenzo here interrupted his friend's narrative:</P>
<P>"How!" &s;aid he, "you have never di&s;|covered who he was, or even formed a gue&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me," replied the marquis:

"when I related this adventure to my un|cle, the cardinal-duke, he told me, that he had no doubt of this &s;ingular man's be|ing the celebrated character known uni|ver&s;ally by the name of <HI>the wandering Jew.</HI> His not being permitted to pa&s;s more than fourteen days on the &s;ame &s;pot, the burning cro&s;s impre&s;&s;ed upon his fore|head, the effect which it produced upon the beholders, and many other circum|&s;tances, gave this &s;uppo&s;ition the colour of truth. The cardinal is fully per&s;uaded of it; and for my own part I am inclined to adopt the only &s;olution which offers it&s;elf to this riddle." I return to the narrative from which I have digre&s;&s;ed.]</P>
<P>From this period I recovered my health &s;o rapidly as to a&s;toni&s;h my phy&s;icians. The bleeding nun appeared no more, and I was &s;oon able to &s;et out for Lindenberg. The baron received me with open arms. I con|fided to him the &s;equel of my adventure; and he was not a little plea&s;ed to find that his man&s;ion would be no longer troubled
<PB N="96" REF="97">
with the phantom's quinquennial vi&s;its. I was &s;orry to perceive, that ab&s;ence had not weakened Donna Rodolpha's imprudent pa&s;&s;ion. In a private conver&s;ation which I had with her during my &s;hort &s;tay at the ca&s;tle, &s;he renewed her attempts to per&s;uade me to return her affection. Regarding her as the primary cau&s;e of all my &s;ufferings, I entertained for her no other &s;entiment than di&s;gu&s;t. The &s;keleton of Beatrice was found in the place which &s;he had mentioned. This being all that I &s;ought at Lindenberg, I ha&s;tened to quit the baron's domains, equally anxious to perform the ob&s;equies of the murdered nun, and e&s;cape the impor|tunity of a woman whom I dete&s;ted. I de|parted, followed by Donna Rodolpha's menaces, that my contempt &s;hould not be long unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>I now bent my cour&s;e towards Spain with all diligence. Lucas with my bag|gage had joined me during my abode at Lindenberg. I arrived in my native coun|try without any accident, and immediately
<PB N="97" REF="98">
proceeded to my father's ca&s;tle in Anda|lu&s;ia. The remains of Beatrice were de|po&s;ited in the family vault, all due cere|monies performed, and the number of ma&s;&s;es &s;aid which &s;he had required. Nothing now hindered me from employing all my endeavours to di&s;cover the retreat of Ag|nes. The barone&s;s had a&s;&s;ured me, that her niece had already taken the veil: this intel|ligence I &s;u&s;pected to have been forged by jealou&s;y, and hoped to find my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till at liberty to accept my hand. I en|quired after her family; I found that before her daughter could reach Madrid, Donna Ine&s;illa was no more: you, my dear Lo|renzo, were &s;aid to be abroad, but where I could not di&s;cover: your father was in a di&s;tant province, on a vi&s;it to the duke de Medina; and as to Agnes, no one could or would inform me what was become of her. Theodore, according to promi&s;e, had returned to Stra&s;bourg, where he found his grandfather dead, and Marguerite in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fortune. All her per&s;ua|&s;ions
<PB N="98" REF="99">
to remain with her were fruitle&s;s: he quitted her a &s;econd time, and followed me to Madrid. He exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in forwarding my &s;earch: but our united endeavours were unattended by &s;uc|ce&s;s. The retreat which concealed Agnes remained an impenetrable my&s;tery, and I began to abandon all hopes of recovering her.</P>
<P>About eight months ago I was returning to my hotel in a melancholy humour, having pa&s;&s;ed the evening at the play-hou&s;e. The night was dark, and I was unaccompanied. Plunged in reflections which were far from being agreeable, I perceived not that three men had followed me from the theatre, till, on turning into an unfrequented &s;treet, they all attacked me at the &s;ame time with the utmo&s;t fury. I &s;prang back a few paces, drew my &s;word, and threw my cloak over my left arm. The ob&s;curity of the night was in my favour. For the mo&s;t part the blows of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, being aimed at ran|dom, failed to touch me. I at length was
<PB N="99" REF="100">
fortunate enough to lay one of my adver|&s;aries at my feet: but before this I had already received &s;o many wounds, and was &s;o warmly pre&s;&s;ed, that my de&s;truction would have been inevitable, had not the cla&s;hing of &s;words called a cavalier to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He ran towards me with his &s;word drawn: &s;everal dome&s;tics followed him with torches. His arrival made the combat equal: yet would not the bravoes abandon their de&s;ign, till their &s;ervants were on the point of joining us. They then fled away, and we lo&s;t them in the ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger now addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me with politene&s;s, and enquired whether I was wounded. Faint with the lo&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lood, I could &s;carcely thank him for his &s;ea&s;onable aid, and entreat him to let &s;ome of his &s;ervants convey me to the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas. I no &s;ooner mentioned the name than he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an acquaint|ance of my father's, and declared that he would not permit my being tran&s;ported to
<PB N="100" REF="101">
&s;uch a di&s;tance, before my wounds had been examined. He added, that his hou&s;e was hard by, and begged me to accompany him thither. His manner was &s;o earne&s;t, that I could not reject his offer; and, leaning upon his arm, a few minutes brought me to the porch of a magnificent hotel.</P>
<P>On entering the hou&s;e, an old grey headed dome&s;tic came to welcome my conductor: he enquired when the duke, his ma&s;ter, meant to quit the country, and was an&s;wered, that he would remain there yet &s;ome months. My deliverer then de&s;ired the family &s;urgeon to be &s;ummoned without delay: his orders were obeyed. I was &s;eated upon a &s;opha in a noble apartment; and my wounds being examined, they were declared to be very &s;light. The &s;urgeon, however, advi&s;ed me not to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the night air; and the &s;tranger pre&s;&s;ed me &s;o earne&s;tly to take a bed in his hou&s;e, that I con&s;ented to re|main where I was for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Being now left alone with my deliverer, I took the opportunity of thanking him in
<PB N="101" REF="102">
more expre&s;s terms than I had done hitherto; but he begged me to be &s;ilent upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"I e&s;teem my&s;elf happy," &s;aid he, "in having had it in my power to render you this little &s;ervice; and I &s;hall think my&s;elf eternally obliged to my daughter for de|taining me &s;o late at the convent of St. Clare. The high e&s;teem in which I have ever held the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, though accident has not permitted our being &s;o intimate as I could wi&s;h, makes me re|joice in the opportunity of making his &s;on's acquaintance. I am certain that my brother, in who&s;e hou&s;e you now are, will lament his not being at Madrid to receive you him|&s;elf: but, in the duke's ab&s;ence, I am ma&s;ter of the family, and may a&s;&s;ure you, in his name, that every thing in the hotel de Me|dina is perfectly at your di&s;po&s;al."</P>
<P>Conceive my &s;urpri&s;e, Lorenzo, at di&s;|covering, in the per&s;on of my pre&s;erver, Don Ga&s;ton de Medina. It was only to be equalled by my &s;ecret &s;atisfaction at the a&s;&s;|urance,
<PB N="102" REF="103">
that Agnes inhabited the convent of St. Clare. This latter &s;en&s;ation was not a little weakened, when, in an&s;wer to my &s;eemingly indifferent que&s;tions, he told me that his daughter had really taken the veil. I &s;uffered not my grief at this circum&s;tance to take root in my mind: I flattered my&s;elf with the idea, that my uncle's credit at the court of Rome would remove this ob&s;tacle, and that, without difficulty, I &s;hould obtain for my mi&s;tre&s;s a di&s;pen&s;ation from her vows. Buoyed up with this hope, I calmed the unea&s;ine&s;s of my bo&s;om; and I re|doubled my endeavours to appear grateful for the attention, and plea&s;ed with the &s;o|ciety, of Don Ga&s;ton.</P>
<P>A dome&s;tic now entered the room, and informed me that the bravo whom I had wounded, di&s;covered &s;ome &s;igns of life. I de|&s;ired that he might be carried to my father's hotel, and &s;aid that, as &s;oon as he recovered his voice, I would examine him re&s;pecting his rea&s;ons for attempting my life. I was an&s;wered that he was already able to &s;peak,
<PB N="103" REF="104">
though with difficulty. Don Ga&s;ton's cu|rio&s;ity made him pre&s;s me to interrogate the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in his pre&s;ence; but this curio&s;ity I was by no means inclined to gratify. One rea&s;on was, that, doubting from whence the blow came, I was unwilling to place before Don Ga&s;ton's eyes the guilt of a &s;i&s;ter. Another was, that I feared to be recognized for Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada, and precautions taken in con&s;equence to keep me from the &s;ight of Agnes. To avow my pa&s;&s;ion for his daughter, and endeavour to make him enter into my &s;chemes, what I knew of Don Ga&s;ton's character convinced me would be an imprudent &s;tep; and con&s;idering it to be e&s;&s;ential that he &s;hould know me for no other than the cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas, I was determined not to let him hear the bravo's confe&s;&s;ion. I in&s;inuated to him, that as I &s;u&s;pected a lady to be concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, who&s;e name might accidentally e&s;cape from the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to examine the man in private. Don Ga&s;ton's delicacy would not permit his
<PB N="104" REF="105">
urging the point any longer, and, in con|&s;equence, the bravo was conveyed to my hotel.</P>
<P>The next morning I took leave of my ho&s;t, who was to return to the duke on the &s;ame day. My wounds had been &s;o trifling, that, except being obliged to wear my arm in a &s;ling for a &s;hort time, I felt no incon|venience from the night's adventure. The &s;urgeon who examined the bravo's wound declared it to be mortal: he had ju&s;t time to confe&s;s, that he had been in&s;tigated to murder me by the revengeful Donna Ro|dolpha, and expired in a few minutes after.</P>
<P>All my thoughts were now bent upon getting to the &s;peech of my lovely nun. Theodore &s;et him&s;elf to work, and, for this time, with better &s;ucce&s;s. He attacked the gardener of St. Clare &s;o forcibly with bribes and promi&s;es, that the old man was entirely gained over to my intere&s;ts; and it was &s;ettled that I &s;hould be introduced into the convent in the character of his a&s;&s;i&s;tant.
<PB N="105" REF="106">
The plan was put into execution without delay. Di&s;gui&s;ed in a common habit, and a black patch covering one of my eyes, I was pre&s;ented to the lady priore&s;s, who con|de&s;cended to approve of the gardener's choice. I immediately entered upon my employment. Botany having been a fa|vourite &s;tudy with me, I was by no means at a lo&s;s in my new &s;tation. For &s;ome days I continued to work in the convent-garden without meeting the object of my di&s;gui&s;e. On the fourth morning I was more &s;ucce&s;s|ful. I heard the voice of Agnes, and was &s;peeding towards the &s;ound, when the &s;ight of the domina &s;topped me. I drew back with caution, and concealed my&s;elf behind a thick clump of trees.</P>
<P>The priore&s;s advanced, and &s;eated her&s;elf with Agnes on a bench at no great di&s;tance. I heard her, in an angry tone, blame her companion's continual melancholy. She told her, that to weep the lo&s;s of any lover, in her &s;ituation, was a crime; but that to weep the lo&s;s of a faithle&s;s one was folly
<PB N="106" REF="107">
and ab&s;urdity in the extreme. Agnes re|plied in &s;o low a voice that I could not di&s;|tingui&s;h her words, but I perceived that &s;he u&s;ed terms of gentlene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The conver&s;ation was interrupted by the ar|rival of a young pen&s;ioner, who informed the domina that &s;he was waited for in the parlour. The old lady ro&s;e, ki&s;&s;ed the cheek of Agnes, and retired. The new|comer remained. Agnes &s;poke much to her in prai&s;e of &s;omebody whom I could not make out; but her auditor &s;eemed highly delighted, and intere&s;ted by the conver&s;a|tion. The nun &s;hewed her &s;everal letters: the other peru&s;ed them with evident plea|&s;ure, obtained permi&s;&s;ion to copy them, and withdrew for that purpo&s;e to my great &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was &s;he out of &s;ight, than I quitted my concealment. Fearing to alarm my lovely mi&s;tre&s;s, I drew near her gently, intending to di&s;cover my&s;elf by degrees. But who for a moment can deceive the eyes of love? She rai&s;ed her head at my approach,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
and recogni&s;ed me, in &s;pite of my di&s;gui&s;e, at a &s;ingle glance. She ro&s;e ha&s;tily from her &s;eat with an exclamation of &s;urpri&s;e, and attempted to retire; but I followed her, detained her, and entreated to be heard. Per&s;uaded of my fal&s;ehood, &s;he refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to me, and ordered me po&s;itively to quit the garden. It was now my turn to refu&s;e. I prote&s;ted that, however dangerous might be the con&s;equences, I would not leave her till &s;he had heard my ju&s;tification. I a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he had been deceived by the artifices of her relations: that I could convince her, beyond the power of doubt, that my pa&s;&s;ion had been pure and di&s;in|tere&s;ted; and I a&s;ked her what &s;hould in|duce me to &s;eek her in the convent, were I influenced by the &s;elfi&s;h motives which my enemies had a&s;cribed to me.</P>
<P>My prayers, my arguments, and vows not to quit her till &s;he had promi&s;ed to li&s;ten to me, united to her fears left the nuns &s;hould &s;ee me with her, to her natural curio&s;ity, and to the affection which &s;he &s;till felt for
<PB N="108" REF="109">
me, in &s;pite of my &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;ertion, at length prevailed. She told me, that to grant my reque&s;t at that moment was im|po&s;&s;ible; but &s;he engaged to be in the &s;ame &s;pot at eleven that night, and to conver&s;e with me for the la&s;t time. Having ob|tained this promi&s;e, I relea&s;ed her hand, and &s;he fled back with rapidity towards the convent.</P>
<P>I communicated my &s;ucce&s;s to my ally, the old gardener: he pointed out an hiding place, where I might &s;helter my&s;elf till night without fear of a di&s;covery. Thither I be|took my&s;elf at the hour when I ought to have retired with my &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;ter, and waited impatiently for the appointed time. The chillne&s;s of the night was in my favour, &s;ince it kept the other nuns confined to their cells. Agnes alone was in&s;en&s;ible of the in|clemency of the air, and, before eleven, joined me at the &s;pot which had witne&s;&s;ed our former interview. Secure from inter|ruption, I related to her the true cau&s;e of my di&s;appearing on the fatal fifth of May.
<PB N="109" REF="110">
She was evidently much affected by my nar|rative. When it was concluded, &s;he con|fe&s;&s;ed the inju&s;tice of her &s;u&s;picions, and blamed her&s;elf for having taken the veil through de&s;pair at my ingratitude.</P>
<P>"But now it is too late to repine!" &s;he added; "the die is thrown: I have pro|nounced my vows, and dedicated my&s;elf to the &s;ervice of heaven. I am &s;en&s;ible how ill I am calculated for a convent. My di&s;|gu&s;t at a mona&s;tic life increa&s;es daily: ennui and di&s;content are my con&s;tant companions; and I will not conceal from you, that the pa&s;&s;ion which I formerly felt for one &s;o near being my hu&s;band, is not yet extingui&s;hed in my bo&s;om: but we mu&s;t part! In&s;u|perable barriers divide us from each other, and on this &s;ide the grave we mu&s;t never meet again!"</P>
<P>I now exerted my&s;elf to prove, that our union was not &s;o impo&s;&s;ible as &s;he &s;eemed to think it. I vaunted to her the cardinal-duke of Lerma's influence at the court of Rome. I a&s;&s;ured her, that I &s;hould ea&s;ily
<PB N="110" REF="111">
obtain a di&s;pen&s;ation from her vows; and I doubted not but Don Ga&s;ton would coincide with my views, when informed of my real name and long attachment. Agnes replied, that &s;ince I encouraged &s;uch an hope, I could know but little of her father. Liberal and kind in every other re&s;pect, &s;uper&s;tition formed the only &s;tain upon his character. Upon this head he was inflexible: he &s;acrificed his deare&s;t intere&s;ts to his &s;cruples, and would con&s;ider it an in&s;ult to &s;uppo&s;e him capable of authori&s;ing his daughter to break her vows to heaven.</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid I, interrupting her&mdash; "&s;uppo&s;e that he &s;hould di&s;approve of our union: let him remain ignorant of my pro|ceedings till I have re&s;cued you from the pri&s;on in which you are now confined.

<P>"Don Raymond," replied Agnes, in a firm and re&s;olute voice, "I love my father: he has treated me har&s;hly in this one in|&s;tance; but I have received from him, in every other, &s;o many proofs of love, that his affection is become nece&s;&s;ary to my ex|i&s;tence. Were I to quit the convent, he never would forgive me; nor can I think that, on his death-bed, he would leave me his cur&s;e, without &s;huddering at the very idea. Be&s;ides, I am con&s;cious my&s;elf, that my vows are binding. Wilfully did I con|tract my engagement with heaven: I cannot break it without a crime. Then bani&s;h from your mind the idea of our being ever united. I am devoted to religion; and however I may grieve at our &s;eparation, I would oppo&s;e ob&s;tacles my&s;elf, to what I feel would render me guilty."</P>
<P>I &s;trove to over-rule the&s;e ill-grounded
<PB N="112" REF="113">
&s;cruples. We were &s;till di&s;puting upon the &s;ubject, when the convent-bell &s;um|moned the nuns to matins. Agnes was obliged to attend them; but &s;he left me not till I had compelled her to promi&s;e, that on the following night &s;he would be at the &s;ame place at the &s;ame hour. The&s;e meetings continued for &s;everal weeks uninterrupted: and 'tis now, Lorenzo, that I mu&s;t implore your indulgence. Reflect upon our &s;ituation, our youth, our long attachment. Weigh all the circum&s;tances which attended our a&s;|&s;ignations, and you will confe&s;s the temp|tation to have been irre&s;i&s;tible: you will even pardon me when I acknowledge that, in an unguarded moment, the honour of Agnes was &s;acrificed to my pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>[Lorenzo's eyes &s;parkled with fury; a deep crim&s;on &s;pread it&s;elf over his face: he &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and attempted to draw his &s;word. The marquis was aware of his movement, and caught his hand: he pre&s;&s;ed it affectionately:</P>
<P>"My friend! my brother! hear me to
<PB N="113" REF="114">
the conclu&s;ion! Till then re&s;train your pa&s;&s;ion; and be at lea&s;t convinced, that if what I have related is criminal, the blame mu&s;t fall upon me, and not upon your &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;uffered him&s;elf to be prevailed upon by Don Raymond's entreaties: he re|&s;umed his place, and li&s;tened to the re&s;t of the narrative with a gloomy and impatient countenance. The marquis thus con|tinued:]</P>
<P>Scarcely was the fir&s;t bur&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion pa&s;t, when Agnes, recovering her&s;elf, &s;tarted from my arms with horror. She called me infamous &s;educer, loaded me with the bit|tere&s;t reproaches, and beat her bo&s;om in all the wildne&s;s of delirium. A&s;hamed of my imprudence, I with difficulty found words to excu&s;e my&s;elf. I endeavoured to con&s;ole her: I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and en|treated her forgivene&s;s. She forced her hand from me, which I had taken and would have pre&s;&s;ed to my lips.</P>
<P>"Touch me not!" &s;he cried, with a
<PB N="114" REF="115">
violence which terrified me. "Mon&s;ter of perfidy and ingratitude, how have I been deceived in you! I looked upon you as my friend, my protector: I tru&s;ted my&s;elf in your hands with confidence, and, relying upon your honour, thought that mine ran no ri&s;k: and 'tis by you, whom I adored, that I am covered with infamy! 'Tis by you that I have been &s;educed into breaking my vows to God, that I am reduced to a level with the ba&s;e&s;t of my &s;ex! Shame upon you, villain, you &s;hall never &s;ee me more!"</P>
<P>She &s;tarted from the bank on which &s;he was &s;eated. I endeavoured to detain her; but &s;he di&s;engaged her&s;elf from me with violence, and took refuge in the convent.</P>
<P>I retired, filled with confu&s;ion and inquie|tude. The next morning I failed not, as u&s;ual, to appear in the garden; but Agnes was no where to be &s;een. At night I waited for her at the place where we generally met. I found no better &s;ucce&s;s. Several days and nights pa&s;&s;ed away in the &s;ame manner. At
<PB N="115" REF="116">
length I &s;aw my offended mi&s;tre&s;s cro&s;s the walk, on who&s;e borders I was working: &s;he was accompanied by the &s;ame young pen|&s;ioner, on who&s;e arm &s;he &s;eemed, from weakne&s;s, obliged to &s;upport her&s;elf. She looked upon me for a moment, but in&s;tantly turned her head away. I waited her re|turn; but &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on to the convent without paying any attention to me, or the penitent looks with which I implored her forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the nuns were retired, the old gardener joined me with a &s;orrowful air.</P>
<P>"Segnor," &s;aid he, "it grieves me to &s;ay, that I can be no longer of u&s;e to you; the lady whom you u&s;ed to meet has ju&s;t a&s;&s;ured me, that if I admitted you again into the garden, &s;he would di&s;cover the whole bu&s;ine&s;s to the lady priore&s;s. She bade me tell you al&s;o, that your pre&s;ence was an in&s;ult, and that, if you &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s the lea&s;t re&s;pect for her, you will never at|tempt to &s;ee her more. Excu&s;e me then
<PB N="116" REF="117">
for informing you, that I can favour your di&s;gui&s;e no longer. Should the priore&s;s be acquainted with my conduct, &s;he might not be contented with di&s;mi&s;&s;ing me her &s;er|vice: out of revenge, &s;he might accu&s;e me of having profaned the convent, and cau&s;e me to be thrown into the pri&s;ons of the In|qui&s;ition."</P>
<P>Fruitle&s;s were my attempts to conquer his re&s;olution. He denied me all future entrance into the garden; and Agnes per&s;evered in neither letting me &s;ee or hear from her. In about a fortnight after, a violent illne&s;s which had &s;eized my father obliged me to &s;et out for Andalu&s;ia. I ha&s;tened thither, and, as I imagined, found the marquis at the point of death. Though, on its fir&s;t appearance, his complaint was declared mortal, he lingered out &s;everal months; during which, my attendance upon him in his malady, and the occupation of &s;et|tling his affairs after his decea&s;e, permitted not my quitting Andalu&s;ia. Within the&s;e four days I returned to Madrid, and, on ar|riving
<PB N="117" REF="118">
at my hotel, I there found this letter waiting for me.</P>
<P>[Here the marquis unlocked a drawer of a cabinet; he took out a folded paper, which he pre&s;ented to his auditor. Lorenzo opened it, and recogni&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter's hand. The contents were as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>INTO what an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery have you plunged me! Raymond, you force me to become as criminal as your&s;elf. I had re&s;olved never to &s;ee you more; if po&s;|&s;ible, to forget you; if not, only to re|member you with hate. A being, for whom I already feel a mother's tenderne&s;s, &s;olicits me to pardon my &s;educer, and ap|ply to his love for the means of pre&s;erva|tion. Raymond, your child lives in my bo&s;om. I tremble at the vengeance of the priore&s;s. I tremble much for my&s;elf, yet more for the innocent creature who&s;e ex|i&s;tence depends upon mine. Both of us are lo&s;t, &s;hould my &s;ituation be di&s;covered. Advi&s;e me, then, what &s;teps to take, but
<PB N="118" REF="119">
&s;eek not to &s;ee me. The gardener, who un|dertakes to deliver this, is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and we have nothing to hope from that quarter. The man engaged in his place is of incor|ruptible fidelity. The be&s;t means of con|veying to me your an&s;wer, is by concealing it under the great &s;tatue of St. Francis, which &s;tands in the Capuchin cathedral; thither I go every Thur&s;day to confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall ea&s;ily have an opportunity of &s;e|curing your letter. I hear that you are now ab&s;ent from Madrid. Need I entreat you to write the very moment of your return? I will not think it. Ah! Raymond! mine is a cruel &s;ituation! Deceived by my neare&s;t relations, compelled to embrace a profe&s;|&s;ion the duties of which I am ill cal|culated to perform, con&s;cious of the &s;anc|tity of tho&s;e duties, and &s;educed into violating them by one whom I lea&s;t &s;u&s;|pected of perfidy, I am now obliged, by circum&s;tances, to choo&s;e between death and perjury. Woman's timidity, and maternal affection, permit me not to balance in the choice. I feel all the guilt into which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="119" REF="120">
plunge my&s;elf when I yield to the plan which you before propo&s;ed to me. My poor father's death, which has taken place &s;ince we met, has removed one ob&s;tacle. He &s;leeps in his grave, and I no longer dread his anger. But from the anger of God, oh! Raymond! who &s;hall &s;hield me? Who can protect me again&s;t my con&s;cience, again&s;t my&s;elf? I dare not dwell upon the&s;e thoughts; they will drive me mad. I have taken my re&s;olu|tion. Procure a di&s;pen&s;ation from my vows. I am ready to fly with you. Write to me, my hu&s;band! Tell me that ab|&s;ence has not abated your love! Tell me that you will re&s;cue from death your unborn child, and its unhappy mother. I live in all the agonies of terror. Every eye which is fixed upon me, &s;eems to read my &s;ecret and my &s;hame. And you are the cau&s;e of tho&s;e agonies! Oh! when my heart fir&s;t loved you, how little did it &s;u&s;pect you of making it feel &s;uch pangs!</P>

<P><PB N="120" REF="121">Having peru&s;ed the letter, Lorenzo re|&s;tored it in &s;ilence. The marquis replaced it in the cabinet, and then proceeded:]</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive was my joy at reading this in|telligence, &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, &s;o little ex|pected. My plan was &s;oon arranged. When Don Ga&s;ton di&s;covered to me his daughter's retreat, I entertained no doubt of her readi|ne&s;s to quit the convent: I had, therefore, entru&s;ted the cardinal-duke of Lerma wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the whole affair, who immediately bu&s;ied him&s;elf in obtaining the nece&s;&s;ary bull. For|tunately, I had afterwards neglected to &s;top his proceedings. Not long &s;ince I received a letter from him, &s;tating that he expected daily to receive the order from the court of Rome. Upon this I would willingly have relied; but the cardinal wrote me word, that I mu&s;t find &s;ome means of conveying Agnes out of the convent, unknown to the priore&s;s. He doubted not but this latter would be much incen&s;ed by lo&s;ing a per&s;on of &s;uch high rank from her &s;ociety, and con&s;ider the renunciation of Agnes as an in&s;ult to her
<PB N="121" REF="122">
hou&s;e. He repre&s;ented her as a woman of a violent and revengeful character, capable of proceeding to the greate&s;t extremities. It was therefore to be feared le&s;t, by con|fining Agnes in the convent, &s;he &s;hould fru&s;trate my hopes, and render the pope's mandate unavailing. Influenced by this con|&s;ideration, I re&s;olved to carry off my mi&s;|tre&s;s, and conceal her till the arrival of the expected bull in the cardinal-duke's e&s;tate. He approved of my de&s;ign, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ready to give a &s;helter to the fugi|tive. I next cau&s;ed the new gardener of St. Clare to be &s;eized privately, and confined in my hotel. By this means I became ma&s;ter of the key to the garden-door, and I had now nothing more to do than prepar&eacute; Agnes for the elopement. This was done by the letter which you &s;aw me deliver this evening. I told her in it, that I &s;hould be ready to re|ceive her at twelve to-morrow night; that I had &s;ecured the key of the garden, and that &s;he might depend upon a &s;peedy re|lea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">You have now, Lorenzo, heard the whole of my long narrative. I have nothing to &s;ay in my excu&s;e, &s;ave that my intentions towards your &s;i&s;ter have been ever the mo&s;t honourable: that it has always been, and &s;till is, my de&s;ign to make her my wife; and that I tru&s;t, when you con&s;ider the&s;e circum&s;tances, our youth, and our attach|ment, you will not only forgive our mo|mentary lap&s;e from virtue, but will aid me in repairing my faults to Agnes, and &s;ecuring a lawful title to her per&s;on and her heart.</P>

<P>HERE the marquis concluded his ad|ventures. Lorenzo, before he could deter|mine on his reply, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome moments in reflection. At length he broke &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Raymond," &s;aid he, taking his hand, "&s;trict honour would oblige me to wa&s;h off in your blood the &s;tain thrown upon my fa|mily; but the circum&s;tances of your ca&s;e forbid me to con&s;ider you as an enemy. The temptation was too great to be re&s;i&s;ted. 'Tis the &s;uper&s;tition of my relations which has
<PB N="124" REF="125">
occa&s;ioned the&s;e misfortunes, and they are more the offenders than your&s;elf and Agnes. What has pa&s;&s;ed between you cannot be re|called, but may yet be repaired by uniting you to my &s;i&s;ter. You have ever been, you &s;till continue to be, my deare&s;t, and indeed my only friend. I feel for Agnes the true&s;t affection, and there is no one on whom I would be&s;tow her more willingly than on your&s;elf. Pur&s;ue, then, your de&s;ign. I will accompany you to-morrow night, and conduct her my&s;elf to the hou&s;e of the car|dinal. My pre&s;ence will be a &s;anction for her conduct, and prevent her incurring blame by her flight from the convent."</P>
<P>The marquis thanked him in terms by no means deficient in gratitude. Lorenzo then informed him, that he had nothing more to apprehend from Donna Rodolpha's enmity. Five months had already elap&s;ed &s;ince, in an exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he broke a blood-ve&s;&s;el, and expired in the cour&s;e of a few hours. He then proceeded to mention the intere&s;ts of Antonia. The marquis was much &s;ur|pri&s;ed
<PB N="125" REF="126">
at hearing of this new relation. His father had carried his hatred of Elvira to the grave, and had never given the lea&s;t hint that he knew what was become of his elde&s;t &s;on's widow. Don Raymond a&s;&s;ured his friend, that he was not mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing him ready to acknowledge his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and her amiable daughter. The prepara|tions for the elopement would not permit his vi&s;iting them the next day; but, in the mean while, he de&s;ired Lorenzo to a&s;&s;ure them of his friend&s;hip, and to &s;upply Elvira, upon his account, with any &s;ums which &s;he might want. This the youth promi&s;ed to do, as &s;oon as her abode &s;hould be known to him. He then took leave of his future brother, and returned to the palace de Medina.</P>
<P>The day was already on the point of break|ing when the marquis retired to his chamber. Con&s;cious that his narrative would take up &s;ome hours, and wi&s;hing to &s;ecure him&s;elf from interruption, on returning to the hotel he ordered his attendants not to &s;it up for
<PB N="126" REF="127">
him; con&s;equently, he was &s;omewhat &s;ur|pri&s;ed, on entering his anti-room, to find Theodore e&s;tabli&s;hed there. The page &s;at near a table with a pen in his hand, and was &s;o totally occupied by his employment, that he perceived not his lord's approach. The marquis &s;topped to ob&s;erve him. Theodore wrote a few lines, then pau&s;ed, and &s;cratched out a part of the writing; then wrote again, &s;miled, and &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with what he had been about. At la&s;t he threw down his pen, &s;prang from his chair, and clapped his hands together joyfully.</P>
<P>"There it is!" cried he aloud: "now they are charming!"</P>
<P>His tran&s;ports were interrupted by a laugh from the marquis, who &s;u&s;pected the nature of his employment.</P>
<P>"What is &s;o charming, Theodore?"</P>
<P>The youth &s;tarted, and looked round: he blu&s;hed, ran to the table, &s;eized the paper on which he had been writing, and con|cealed it in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Oh! my lord, I knew not that you were
<PB N="127" REF="128">
&s;o near me. Can I be of u&s;e to you? Lu|cas is already gone to bed."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall follow his example when I have given my opinion of your ver&s;es."</P>
<P>"My ver&s;es, my lord?"</P>
<P>"Nay, I am &s;ure that you have been writing &s;ome, for nothing el&s;e could have kept you awake till this time of the morning. Where are they, Theodore? I &s;hall like to &s;ee your compo&s;ition."</P>
<P>Theodore's cheeks glowed with &s;till deeper crim&s;on: he longed to &s;hew his poetry, but fir&s;t cho&s;e to be pre&s;&s;ed for it.</P>
<P>"Indeed, my lord, they are not worthy your attention."</P>
<P>"Not the&s;e ver&s;es, which you ju&s;t now declared to be &s;o charming? Come, come, let me &s;ee whether our opinions are the &s;ame. I promi&s;e that you &s;hall find in me an in|dulgent critic."</P>
<P>The boy produced his paper with &s;eem|ing reluctance; but the &s;atisfaction which &s;parkled in his dark expre&s;&s;ive eyes be|trayed the vanity of his little bo&s;om. The
<PB N="128" REF="129">
marquis &s;miled while he ob&s;erved the emo|tions of an heart as yet but little &s;killed in veiling its &s;entiments. He &s;eated him&s;elf upon a &s;opha. Theodore, while hope and fear contended on his anxious countenance, waited with inquietude for his ma&s;ter's de|ci&s;ion, while the marquis read the following lines:

<P>The marquis returned the paper with a &s;mile of encouragement.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134">"Your little poem plea&s;es me much," &s;aid he: "however, you mu&s;t not count my opinion for any thing. I am no judge of ver&s;es, and for my own part never com|po&s;ed more than &s;ix lines in my life: tho&s;e &s;ix produced &s;o unlucky an effect, that I am fully re&s;olved never to compo&s;e another. But I wander from my &s;ubject. I was go|ing to &s;ay that you cannot employ your time wor&s;e than in making ver&s;es. An au|thor, whether good or bad, or between both, is an animal whom every body is privileged to attack: for though all are not able to write books, all conceive them&s;elves able to judge them. A bad compo&s;ition carries with it its own puni&s;hment&mdash;con|tempt and ridicule. A good one excites envy, and entails upon its author a thou|&s;and mortifications: he finds him&s;elf a&s;|&s;ailed by partial and ill-humoured critici&s;m: one man finds fault with the plan, another with the &s;tyle, a third with the precept which it &s;trives to inculcate; and they who can|not &s;ucceed in finding fault with the book,
<PB N="134" REF="135">
employ them&s;elves in &s;tigmatizing its au|thor. They maliciou&s;ly rake out from ob|&s;curity every little circum&s;tance which may throw ridicule upon his private character or conduct, and aim at wounding the man &s;ince they cannot hurt the writer. In &s;hort, to enter the li&s;ts of literature is wilfully to expo&s;e your&s;elf to the arrows of neglect, ri|dicule, envy, and di&s;appointment. Whe|ther you write well or ill, be a&s;&s;ured that you will not e&s;cape from blame. Indeed this circum&s;tance contains a young author's chief con&s;olation: he remembers that Lope de Vega and Calderona had unju&s;t and en|vious critics, and he mode&s;tly conceives him&s;elf to be exactly in their predicament. But I am con&s;cious that all the&s;e &s;age ob|&s;ervations are thrown away upon you. Au|thor&s;hip is a mania, to conquer which no rea&s;ons are &s;ufficiently &s;trong; and you might as ea&s;ily per&s;uade me not to love, as I per&s;uade you not to write. However, if you cannot help being occa&s;ionally &s;eized with a poetical paroxy&s;m, take at lea&s;t the
<PB N="135" REF="136">
precaution of communicating your ver&s;es to none but tho&s;e who&s;e partiality for you &s;ecures their approbation."</P>
<P>"Then, my lord, you do not think the&s;e lines tolerable?" &s;aid Theodore, with an humble and dejected air.</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take my meaning. As I &s;aid before, they have plea&s;ed me much: but my regard for you makes me partial, and others might judge them le&s;s favourably. I mu&s;t &s;till remark, that even my prejudice in your favour does not blind me &s;o much as to prevent my ob&s;erving &s;everal faults. For in&s;tance, you make a terrible confu&s;ion of metaphors; you are too apt to make the &s;trength of your lines con&s;i&s;t more in the words than &s;en&s;e; &s;ome of the ver&s;es only &s;eem introduced in order to rhyme with others; and mo&s;t of the be&s;t ideas are bor|rowed from other poets, though po&s;&s;ibly you are uncon&s;cious of the theft your&s;elf. The&s;e faults may occa&s;ionally be excu&s;ed in a work of length; but a &s;hort poem mu&s;t be correct and perfect."</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">"All this is true, &s;egnor; but you &s;hould con&s;ider that I only write for plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"Your defects are the le&s;s excu&s;able. Their incorrectne&s;s may be forgiven, who work for money, who are obliged to com|plete a given ta&s;k in a given time, and are paid according to the bulk, not value of their productions. But in tho&s;e whom no nece&s;&s;ity forces to turn author, who merely write for fame, and have full lei&s;ure to po|li&s;h their compo&s;itions, faults are unpardon|able, and merit the &s;harpe&s;t arrows of criti|ci&s;m."</P>
<P>The marquis ro&s;e from the &s;opha; the page looked di&s;couraged and melancholy; and this did not e&s;cape his ma&s;ter's ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>"However," added he, &s;miling, "I think that the&s;e lines do you no di&s;credit. Your ver&s;ification is tolerably ea&s;y, and your ear &s;eems to be ju&s;t. The peru&s;al of your little poem upon the whole gave me much plea|&s;ure; and if it is nor a&s;king too great a fa|vour,
<PB N="137" REF="138">
I &s;hall be highly obliged to you for a copy."</P>
<P>The youth's countenance immediately cleared up. He perceived not the &s;mile, half approving, half ironical, which accom|panied the reque&s;t, and he promi&s;ed the copy with great readine&s;s. The marquis withdrew to his chamber, much amu&s;ed by the in&s;tantaneous effect produced upon Theodore's vanity by the conclu&s;ion of his critici&s;m. He threw him&s;elf upon his couch, &s;leep &s;oon &s;tole over him, and his dreams pre&s;ented him with the mo&s;t flattering pic|tures of happine&s;s with Agnes.</P>
<P>On reaching the hotel de Medina, Lo|renzo's fir&s;t care was to enquire for letters. He found &s;everal waiting for him; but that which he &s;ought was not among&s;t them. Leonella had found it impo&s;&s;ible to write that evening. However, her impatience to &s;ecure Don Chri&s;toval's heart, on which &s;he flattered her&s;elf with having made no &s;light impre&s;&s;ion, permitted her not to pa&s;s an|other day without informing him where
<PB N="138" REF="139">
&s;he was to be found. On her return from the Capuchin-church, &s;he had related to her &s;i&s;ter, with exultation, how attentive an hand&s;ome cavalier had been to her; as al&s;o how his companion had undertaken to plead Antonia's cau&s;e with the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas. Elvira received this intelligence with &s;en&s;ations very different from tho&s;e with which it was communicated. She blamed her &s;i&s;ter's imprudence in confiding her hi&s;tory to an ab&s;olute &s;tranger, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed her fears le&s;t this incon&s;iderate &s;tep &s;hould prejudice the marquis again&s;t her. The greate&s;t of her apprehen&s;ions &s;he con|cealed in her own brea&s;t. She had ob&s;erved, with inquietude, that at the mention of Lo|renzo a deep blu&s;h &s;pread it&s;elf over her daughter's cheek. The timid Antonia dared not to pronounce his name. Without know|ing wherefore, &s;he felt embarra&s;&s;ed when he was made the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and en|deavoured to change the conver&s;ation to Ambro&s;io. Elvira perceived the emotions of this young bo&s;om: in con&s;equence, &s;he
<PB N="39" REF="140">
in&s;i&s;ted upon Leonella's breaking her pro|mi&s;e to the cavaliers. A &s;igh, which on hearing this order e&s;caped from Antonia, confirmed the wary mother in her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Through this re&s;olution Leonella was determined to break: &s;he conceived it to be in&s;pired by envy, and that her &s;i&s;ter dreaded her being elevated above her. Without imparting her de&s;ign to any one, &s;he took an opportunity of di&s;patching the following note to Lorenzo: it was delivered to him as &s;oon as he woke:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"Doubtle&s;s, Segnor Don Lorenzo, you have frequently accu&s;ed me of ingratitude and forgetfulne&s;s: but on the word of a vir|gin it was out of my power to perform my promi&s;e ye&s;terday. I know not in what words to inform you, how &s;trange a recep|tion my &s;i&s;ter gave your kind wi&s;h to vi&s;it her. She is an odd woman, with many good points about her; but her jealou&s;y of me frequently makes her conceive notions quite unaccountable. On hearing that your friend
<PB N="140" REF="141">
had paid &s;ome little attention to me, &s;he immediately took the alarm: &s;he blamed my conduct, and has ab&s;olutely forbidden me to let you know our abode. My &s;trong &s;en&s;e of gratitude for your kind offers of &s;ervice, and&mdash;&s;hall I confe&s;s it? my de&s;ire to behold once more the too amiable Don Chri&s;toval, will not permit my obey|ing her injunctions. I have therefore &s;tolen a moment to inform you, that we lodge in the &s;trada di San Jago, four doors from the palace d' Albornos, and nearly oppo&s;ite to the barber's Miguel Coello. Enquire for Donna Elvira Dalfa, &s;ince, in compliance with her father-in-law's order, my &s;i&s;ter continues to be called by her maiden name, At eight this evening you will be &s;ure of finding us: but let not a word drop, which may rai&s;e a &s;u&s;picion of my having written this letter. Should you &s;ee the Cond&eacute; d' O&s;|&s;orio, tell him&mdash;I blu&s;h while I declare it&mdash;&mdash;tell him that his pre&s;ence will be but too acceptable to the &s;ympathetic</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>"LEONELLA."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142">The latter &s;entences were written in red ink, to expre&s;s the blu&s;hes of her cheek while &s;he committed an outrage upon her virgin mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Lorenzo had no &s;ooner peru&s;ed this note, than he &s;et out in &s;earch of Don Chri&s;|toval. Not being able to find him in the cour&s;e of the day, he proceeded to Donna Elvira's alone, to Leonella's infinite di&s;ap|pointment. The dome&s;tic by whom he &s;ent up his name having already declared his lady to be at home, &s;he had no excu&s;e for refu&s;ing his vi&s;it: yet &s;he con&s;ented to receive it with much reluctance. That re|luctance was increa&s;ed by the changes which his approach produced in Antonia's countenance; nor was it by any means a|bated, when the youth him&s;elf appeared. The &s;ymmetry of his per&s;on, animation of his features, and natural elegance of his manners and addre&s;s, convinced Elvira that &s;uch a gue&s;t mu&s;t be dangerous for her daughter. She re&s;olved to treat him with di&s;tant politene&s;s, to decline his &s;er|vices
<PB N="142" REF="143">
with gratitude for the tender of them, and to make him feel, without offence, that his future vi&s;its would be far from accepta|ble.</P>
<P>On his entrance he found Elvira, who was indi&s;po&s;ed, reclining upon a &s;opha; Antonia &s;at by her embroidery frame; and Leonella, in a pa&s;toral dre&s;s, held <HI>"Monte|mayor's Diana."</HI> In &s;pite of her being the mother of Antonia, Lorenzo could not help expecting to find in Elvira Leonella's true &s;i&s;ter, and the daughter of "as hone&s;t a pains-taking &s;hoemaker as any in Cordova." A &s;ingle glance was &s;ufficient to undeceive him. He beheld a woman who&s;e features, though impaired by time and &s;orrow, &s;till bore the marks of di&s;tingui&s;hed beauty: a &s;erious dignity reigned upon her counte|nance, but was tempered by a grace and &s;weetne&s;s which rendered her truly enchant|ing. Lorenzo fancied that &s;he mu&s;t have re&s;embled her daughter in her youth, and readily excu&s;ed the imprudence of the late Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas. She de&s;ired him
<PB N="143" REF="144">
to be &s;eated, and immediately re&s;umed her place upon the &s;opha.</P>
<P>Antonia received him with a &s;imple re|verence, and continued her work: her cheeks were &s;uffu&s;ed with crim&s;on, and &s;he &s;trove to conceal her emotion by lean|ing over her embroidery frame. Her aunt al&s;o cho&s;e to play off her airs of mode&s;ty: &s;he affected to blu&s;h and tremble, and waited with her eyes ca&s;t down to receive, as &s;he expected, the compliments of Don Chri&s;to|val. Finding, after &s;ome time, that no &s;ign of his approach was given, &s;he ventured, to look round the room, and perceived with vexation that Medina was unaccompanied. Impatience would not permit her waiting for an explanation: interrupting Lorenzo, who was delivering Raymond's me&s;&s;age, &s;he de&s;ired to know what was become of his friend.</P>
<P>He, who thought it nece&s;&s;ary to main|tain him&s;elf in her good graces, &s;trove to con&s;ole her under her di&s;appointment by committing a little violence upon truth.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">"Ah! &s;egnora," he replied in a melan|choly voice, "how grieved will he be at lo&s;ing this opportunity of paying you his re&s;pects! A relation's illne&s;s has obliged him to quit Madrid in ha&s;te: but on his re|turn he will doubtle&s;s &s;eize the fir&s;t mo|ment with tran&s;port to throw him&s;elf at your feet!"</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, his eyes met tho&s;e of Elvira: &s;he puni&s;hed his fal&s;ehood &s;uffi|ciently by darting at him a look expre&s;&s;ive of di&s;plea&s;ure and reproach. Neither did the deceit an&s;wer his intention. Vexed and di&s;appointed, Leonella ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and retired in dudgeon to her own apart|ment.</P>
<P>Lorenzo ha&s;tened to repair the fault which had injured him in Elvira's opinion. He related his conver&s;ation with the mar|quis re&s;pecting her: he a&s;&s;ured her that Raymond was prepared to acknowledge her for his brother's widow; and that, till it was in his power to pay his compliments to her in per&s;on, Lorenzo was commi&s;&s;ioned
<PB N="145" REF="146">
to &s;upply his place. This intelligence re|lieved Elvira from an heavy weight of un|ea&s;ine&s;s: &s;he had now found a protector for the fatherle&s;s Antonia, for who&s;e future fortunes &s;he had &s;uffered the greate&s;t appre|hen&s;ions. She was not &s;paring of her thanks to him, who had interfered &s;o generou&s;ly in her behalf; but &s;till &s;he gave him no invi|tation to repeat his vi&s;it. Howerer, when upon ri&s;ing to depart he reque&s;ted permi&s;|&s;ion to enquire after her health occa&s;ionally, the polite earne&s;tne&s;s of his manner, grati|tude for his &s;ervices, and re&s;pect for his friend the marquis, would not admit of a refu&s;al. She con&s;ented reluctantly to re|ceive him: he promi&s;ed not to abu&s;e her goodne&s;s, and quitted the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Antonia was now left alone with her mo|ther: a temporary &s;ilence en&s;ued. Both wi&s;hed to &s;peak upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, but neither knew how to introduce it. The one felt a ba&s;hfulne&s;s which &s;ealed up her lips, and for which &s;he could not account; the other feared to find her apprehen&s;ions true,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
or to in&s;pire her daughter with notions to which &s;he might be &s;till a &s;tranger. At length Elvira began the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"That is a charming young man, An|tonia; I am much plea&s;ed with him. Was he long near you ye&s;terday in the cathe|dral?"</P>
<P>"He quitted me not for a moment while I &s;taid in the church: he gave me his &s;eat, and was very obliging and attentive."</P>
<P>"Indeed? Why then have you never mentioned his name to me? Your aunt lanched out in prai&s;e of his friend, and you vaunted Ambro&s;io's eloquence: but neither &s;aid a word of Don Lorenzo's per&s;on and accompli&s;hments. Had not Leonella &s;poken of his readine&s;s to undertake our cau&s;e, I &s;hould not have known him to be in ex|i&s;tence."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed. Antonia coloured, but was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you judge him le&s;s favourably than I do. In my opinion his figure is plea&s;ing, his conver&s;ation &s;en&s;ible, and man|ners
<PB N="147" REF="148">
engaging. Still he may have &s;truck you differently: you may think him di&s;|agreeable, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Di&s;agreeable? Oh! dear mother, how &s;hould I po&s;&s;ibly think him &s;o? I &s;hould be very ungrateful were I not &s;en&s;ible of his kindne&s;s ye&s;terday, and very blind if his merits had e&s;caped me. His figure is &s;o graceful, &s;o noble! His manners &s;o gentle, yet &s;o manly! I never yet &s;aw &s;o many ac|compli&s;hments united in one per&s;on, and I doubt whether Madrid can produce his equal."</P>
<P>"Why then were you &s;o &s;ilent in prai&s;e of this phoenix of Madrid? Why was it concealed from me, that his &s;ociety had af|forded you plea&s;ure?"</P>
<P>"In truth, I know not: you a&s;k me a que&s;tion which I cannot re&s;olve my&s;elf. I was on the point of mentioning him a thou|&s;and times; his name was con&s;tantly on my lips; but when I would have pronounced it, I wanted courage to execute my de&s;ign.
<PB N="148" REF="149">
However, if I did not &s;peak of him, it was not that I thought of him the le&s;s."</P>
<P>"That I believe. But &s;hall I tell you why you wanted courage? It was becau&s;e, accu&s;tomed to confide to me your mo&s;t &s;e|cret thoughts, you knew not how to con|ceal, yet feared to acknowledge, that your heart nouri&s;hed a &s;entiment which you were con&s;cious I &s;hould di&s;approve. Come hither to me, my child."</P>
<P>Antonia quitted her embroidery frame, threw her&s;elf upon her knees by the &s;opha, and hid her face in her mother's lap.</P>
<P>"Fear not, my &s;weet girl! Con&s;ider me equally as your friend and parent, and ap|prehend no reproof from me. I have read the emotions of your bo&s;om; you are yet ill &s;killed in concealing them, and they could not e&s;cape my attentive eye. This Lorenzo is dangerous to your repo&s;e; he has already made an impre&s;&s;ion upon your heart. 'Tis true that I perceive ea&s;ily that your affection is returned: but what can be
<PB N="149" REF="150">
the con&s;equences of this attachment? You are poor and friendle&s;s, my Antonia; Lo|renzo is the heir of the duke of Medina Celi. Even &s;hould him&s;elf mean honour|ably, his uncle never will con&s;ent to your union; nor, without that uncle's con&s;ent, will I. By &s;ad experience I know what &s;orrow &s;he mu&s;t endure, who marries into a family unwilling to receive her. Then &s;truggle with your affection: whatever pains it may co&s;t you, &s;trive to conquer it. Your heart is tender and &s;u&s;ceptible: it has al|ready received a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion; but when once convinced that you &s;hould not encourage &s;uch &s;entiments, I tru&s;t that you have &s;ufficient fortitude to drive them from your bo&s;om."</P>
<P>Antonia ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and promi&s;ed implicit obedience. Elvira then conti|nued&mdash;</P>
<P>"To prevent your pa&s;&s;ion from growing &s;tronger, it will be needful to prohibit Lo|renzo's vi&s;its. The &s;ervice which he has rendered me permits not my forbidding
<PB N="150" REF="151">
them po&s;itively; but unle&s;s I judge too fa|vourably of his character, he will di&s;con|tinue them without taking offence, if I con|fe&s;s to him my rea&s;ons, and throw my&s;elf entirely on his genero&s;ity. The next time that I &s;ee him, I will hone&s;tly avow to him the embarra&s;&s;ment which his pre&s;ence oc|ca&s;ions. How &s;ay you, my child? Is not this mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary?"</P>
<P>Antonia &s;ub&s;cribed to every thing with|out he&s;itation, though not without regret. Her mother ki&s;&s;ed her affectionately, and retired to bed. Antonia followed her ex|ample, and vowed &s;o frequently never more to think of Lorenzo, that till &s;leep clo&s;ed her eyes &s;he thought of nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing at Elvira's, Lo|renzo ha&s;tened to rejoin the marquis. Every thing was ready for the &s;econd elopement of Agnes; and at twelve the two friends with a coach and four were at the garden-wall of the convent. Don Ray|mond drew out his key, and unlocked the
<PB N="151" REF="152">
door. They entered, and waited for &s;ome time in expectation of being joined by Agnes. At length the marquis grew impatient: be|ginning to fear that his &s;econd attempt would &s;ucceed no better than the fir&s;t, he propo&s;ed to reconnoitre the convent. The friends advanced towards it. Every thing was &s;till and dark. The priore&s;s was an|xious to keep the &s;tory a &s;ecret, fearing le&s;t the crime of one of its members &s;hould bring di&s;grace upon the whole community, or that the interpo&s;ition of powerful relations &s;hould deprive her vengeance of its intended vic|tim. She took care therefore to give the lover of Agnes no cau&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e that his de&s;ign was di&s;covered, and his mi&s;tre&s;s on the point of &s;uffering the puni&s;hment of her fault. The &s;ame rea&s;on made her reject the idea of arre&s;ting the unknown &s;educer in the garden: &s;uch a proceeding would have created much di&s;turbance, and the di&s;grace of her convent would have been noi&s;ed about Madrid. She contented her|&s;elf with confining Agnes clo&s;ely: as to the
<PB N="152" REF="153">
lover, &s;he left him at liberty to pur&s;ue his de&s;igns. What &s;he had expected was the re&s;ult. The marquis and Lorenzo waited in vain till the break of day; they then re|tired without noi&s;e, alarmed at the failure of their plan, and ignorant of the cau&s;e of its ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The next morning Lorenzo went to the convent, and reque&s;ted to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter. The priore&s;s appeared at the grate with a melancholy countenance. She informed him that for &s;everal days Agnes had appeared much agitated; that &s;he had been pre&s;&s;ed by the nuns in vain to reveal the cau&s;e, and apply to their tenderne&s;s for advice and con&s;olation; that &s;he had ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in concealing the cau&s;e of her di&s;|tre&s;s; but that on Thur&s;day evening it had produced &s;o violent an effect upon her con|&s;titution, that &s;he had fallen ill, and was actually confined to her bed. Lorenzo did not credit a &s;yllable of this account: he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing his &s;i&s;ter; if &s;he was unable to come to the grate, he de&s;ired to

be admitted to her cell. The priore&s;s cro&s;&s;ed her&s;elf! &s;he was &s;hocked at the very idea of a man's profane eye pervading the interior of her holy man&s;ion, and profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed that Lorenzo could think of &s;uch a thing. She told him that his reque&s;t could not be granted; but that, if he returned the next day, &s;he hoped that her beloved daughter would then be &s;uffi|ciently recovered to join him at the parlour grate. With this an&s;wer Lorenzo was obliged to retire, un&s;atisfied, and trembling for his &s;i&s;ter's &s;afety.</P>
<P>He returned the next morning at an early hour. "Agnes was wor&s;e; the phy&s;i|cian had pronounced her to be in imminent danger; &s;he was ordered to remain quiet, and it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible for her to re|ceive her brother's vi&s;it." Lorenzo &s;tormed at this an&s;wer, but there was no re&s;ource. He raved, he entreated, he threatened; no means were left untried to obtain a fight of Agnes. His endeavours were as fruitle&s;s as tho&s;e of the day before, and he returned in

de&s;pair to the marquis. On his &s;ide, the latter had &s;pared no pains to di&s;cover what had occa&s;ioned his plot to fail. Don Chri&s;|toval, to whom the affair was now entru&s;t|ed, endeavoured to worm out the &s;ecret from the old portere&s;s of St. Clare, with whom he had formed an acquaintance; but &s;he was too much upon her guard, and he gained from her no intelligence. The marquis was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and Lorenzo felt &s;carcely le&s;s inquietude. Both were convinced that the purpo&s;ed elopement mu&s;t have been di&s;covered: they doubted not but the malady of Agnes was a pre|tence, but they knew not by what means to re&s;cue her from the hands of the pri|ore&s;s.</P>
<P>Regularly every day did Lorenzo vi&s;it the convent: as regularly was he informed that his &s;i&s;ter rather grew wor&s;e than bet|ter. Certain that her indi&s;po&s;ition was feigned, the&s;e accounts did not alarm him: but his ignorance of her fate, and of the motives which induced the priore&s;s to keep
<PB N="155" REF="156">
her from him, excited the mo&s;t &s;erious un|ea&s;ine&s;s. He was &s;till uncertain what &s;teps he ought to take, when the marquis receiv|ed a letter from the cardinal-duke of Ler|ma. It inclo&s;ed the pope's expected bull, ordering that Agnes &s;hould be relea&s;ed from her vows, and re&s;tored to her rela|tions. This e&s;&s;ential paper decided at once the proceedings of her friends; they re&s;olved that Lorenzo &s;hould carry it to the domina without delay, and demand that his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be in&s;tantly given up to him. Again&s;t this mandate illne&s;s could not be pleaded: it gave her brother the power of removing her in&s;tantly to the palace de Medina, and he determined to u&s;e that power on the following day.</P>
<P>His mind relieved from inquietude re|&s;pecting his &s;i&s;ter, and his &s;pirits rai&s;ed by the hope of &s;oon re&s;toring her to freedom, he now had time to give a few moments to love and to Antonia. At the &s;ame hour as on his former vi&s;it, he repaired to Donna Elvira's. She had given orders for his ad|mi&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="156" REF="157">
As &s;oon as he was announced, her daughter retired with Leonella; and when he entered the chamber, he found the lady of the hou&s;e alone. She received him with le&s;s di&s;tance than before, and de&s;ired him to place him&s;elf near her upon the &s;opha. She then, without lo&s;ing time, opened her bu|&s;ine&s;s, as had been agreed between her&s;elf and Antonia.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not think me ungrateful, Don Lorenzo, or forgetful how e&s;&s;ential are the &s;ervices which you have rendered me with the marquis. I feel the weight of my obligations: nothing under the &s;un &s;hould induce my taking the &s;tep to which I am now compelled, but the intere&s;t of my child, of my beloved Antonia. My health is declining; God only knows how &s;oon I may be &s;ummoned before his throne. My daughter will be left without parents, and, &s;hould &s;he lo&s;e the protection of the Ci&s;|ternas family, without friends. She is young and artle&s;s, unin&s;tructed in the world's per|fidy, and with charms &s;ufficient to render

her an object of &s;eduction. Judge then how I mu&s;t tremble at the pro&s;pect before her! Judge, how anxious I mu&s;t be to keep her from their &s;ociety, who may excite the yet dormant pa&s;&s;ions of her bo&s;om. You are amiable, Don Lorenzo; Antonia has a &s;u&s;ceptible, a loving heart, and is grateful for the favours conferred upon us by your interference with the marquis. Your pre|&s;ence makes me tremble: I fear le&s;t it &s;hould in&s;pire her with &s;entiments which may embitter the remainder of her life, or encourage her to cheri&s;h hopes in her &s;itu|ation unju&s;tifiable and futile. Pardon me, when I avow my terrors, and let my frank|ne&s;s plead in my excu&s;e. I cannot forbid you my hou&s;e, for gratitude re&s;trains me; I can only throw my&s;elf upon your genero|&s;ity, and entreat you to &s;pare the feelings of an anxious, of a doting mother. Believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I lament the nece&s;&s;ity of rejecting your acquaintance; but there is no remedy, and Antonia's in|tere&s;t obliges me to beg you to forbear your

vi&s;its. By complying with my reque&s;t, you will increa&s;e the e&s;teem which I already feel for you, and of which every thing convinces me that you are truly de&s;erv|ing."</P>
<P>"Your frankne&s;s charms me," replied Lorenzo: "You &s;hall find, that in your favourable opinion of me you were not de|ceived; yet I hope that the rea&s;ons now in my power to allege, will per&s;uade you to withdraw a reque&s;t which I cannot obey without infinite reluctance. I love your daughter, love her mo&s;t &s;incerely; I wi&s;h for no greater happine&s;s than to in&s;pire her with the &s;ame &s;entiments, and receive her hand at the altar as her hu&s;band. 'Tis true I am not rich my&s;elf, my father's death has left me but little in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but my expectations ju&s;tify my pretending to the Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas' daughter."</P>
<P>He was proceeding, but Elvira interrupt|ed him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ah! Don Lorenzo, you forget in that pompous title the meanne&s;s of my origin.
<PB N="159" REF="160">
You forget that I have now pa&s;&s;ed fourteen years in Spain, di&s;avowed by my hu&s;band's family, and exi&s;ting upon a &s;tipend barely &s;ufficient for the &s;upport and education of my daughter. Nay, I have even been neglected by mo&s;t of my own relations, who out of en|vy affect to doubt the reality of my marriage. My allowance being di&s;continued at my father-in-law's death, I was reduced to the very brink of want. In this &s;ituation I was found by my &s;i&s;ter, who, among&s;t all her foibles, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a warm, generous, and af|fectionate heart. She aided me with the little fortune which my father left her, per&s;uaded me to vi&s;it Madrid, and has &s;up|ported my child and my&s;elf &s;ince our quit|ting Murcia. Then, con&s;ider not Antonia as de&s;cended from the Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ter|nas; con&s;ider her as a poor and unprotected orphan, as the grand-child of the trade&s;man Torribio Dalfa, as the needy pen&s;ioner of that trade&s;man's daughter. Reflect upon the difference between &s;uch a &s;ituation and that of the nephew and heir of the potent

duke of Medina. I believe your intentions to be honourable; but as there are no hopes that your uncle will approve of the union, I fore&s;ee that the con&s;equences of your at|tachment mu&s;t be fatal to my child's re|po&s;e."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Segnora; you are mi&s;in|formed if you &s;uppo&s;e the duke of Medina to re&s;emble the generality of men. His &s;entiments are liberal and di&s;intere&s;ted; he loves me well, and I have no rea&s;on to dread his forbidding the marriage, when he perceives that my happine&s;s depends upon Antonia. But &s;uppo&s;ing him to refu&s;e his &s;anction, what have I &s;till to fear? My pa|rents are no more; my little fortune is in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it will be &s;ufficient to &s;upport Antonia, and I &s;hall exchange for her hand Medina's dukedom without one &s;igh of regret."</P>
<P>"You are young and eager; it is natural for you to entertain &s;uch ideas. But expe|rience has taught me to my co&s;t, that cur&s;es accompany an unequal alliance. I married
<PB N="161" REF="162">
the Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas in oppo&s;ition to the will of his relations; many an heart-pang has puni&s;hed me for the imprudent &s;tep. Wherever we bent our cour&s;e, a fa|ther's execration pur&s;ued Gonzalvo. Po|verty overtook us, and no friend was near to relieve our wants. Still our mutual af|fection exi&s;ted, but, alas! not without inter|ruption. Accu&s;tomed to wealth and ea&s;e, ill could my hu&s;band &s;upport the tran&s;ition to di&s;tre&s;s and indigence. He looked back with repining to the comforts which he once enjoyed. He regretted the &s;ituation which for my &s;ake he had quitted; and, in moments when de&s;pair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind, has reproached me with having made him the companion of want and wretchedne&s;s. He has called me his bane! the &s;ource of his &s;orrows, the cau&s;e of his de&s;truction! Ah! God! he little knew how much keener were my own heart's reproaches! He was ig|norant that I &s;uffered trebly, for my&s;elf, for my children, and for him! 'Tis true that
<PB N="162" REF="163">
his anger &s;eldom la&s;ted long: his &s;incere af|fection for me &s;oon revived in his heart, and then his repentance for the tears which he had made me &s;hed, tortured me even more than his reproaches. He would throw him&s;elf on the ground, implore my forgivene&s;s in the mo&s;t frantic terms, and load him&s;elf with cur&s;es for being the mur|derer of my repo&s;e. Taught by experience, that an union contracted again&s;t the incli|nations of families on either &s;ide mu&s;t be unfortunate, I will &s;ave my daughter from tho&s;e mi&s;eries which I have &s;uffered. With|out your uncle's con&s;ent, while I live, &s;he never &s;hall be yours. Undoubtedly he will di&s;approve of the union; his power is im|men&s;e, and Antonia &s;hall not be expo&s;ed to his anger and per&s;ecution."</P>
<P>"His per&s;ecution? How ea&s;ily may that be avoided! Let the wor&s;t happen, it is but quitting Spain. My wealth may ea&s;ily be reali&s;ed. The Indian i&s;lands will offer us a &s;ecure retreat. I have an e&s;tate, though
<PB N="163" REF="164">
not of value, in Hi&s;paniola: thither will we &s;ly, and I &s;hall con&s;ider it to be my native country, if it gives me Antonia's undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Ah! youth, this is a fond, romantic vi&s;ion. Gonzalvo thought the &s;ame. He fancied that he could leave Spain without regret; but the moment of parting unde|ceived him. You know not yet what it is to quit your native land: to quit it, never to behold it more! You know not what it is to exchange the &s;cenes where you have pa&s;&s;ed your infancy, for unknown realms and barbarous climates!&mdash;to be forgotten, utterly, eternally forgotten by the compa|nions of your youth!&mdash;to &s;ee your deare&s;t friends, the fonde&s;t objects of your affection, peri&s;hing with di&s;ea&s;es incidental to Indian atmo&s;pheres, and find your&s;elf unable to procure for them nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance! I have felt all this! My hu&s;band and two &s;weet babes found their graves in Cuba: nothing would have &s;aved my young An|tonia, but my &s;udden return to Spain. Ah!
<PB N="164" REF="165">
Don Lorenzo, could you conceive what I &s;uffered during my ab&s;ence! Could you know how &s;orely I regretted all that I left behind, and how dear to me was the very name of Spain! I envied the winds which blew towards it: and when the Spani&s;h &s;ailor chaunted &s;ome well-known air as he pa&s;&s;ed my window, tears filled my eyes, while I thought upon my native land. Gon|zalvo too&mdash;my hu&s;band&mdash;"</P>
<P>Elvira pau&s;ed. Her voice faltered, and &s;he concealed her face with her handker|chief. After a &s;hort &s;ilence &s;he ro&s;e from the &s;opha, and proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e my quitting you for a few mo|ments: the remembrance of what I have &s;uffered has much agitated me, and I need to be alone. Till I return, peru&s;e the&s;e lines. After my hu&s;band's death I found them among his papers. Had I known &s;ooner that he entertained &s;uch &s;entiments, grief would have killed me. He wrote the&s;e ver&s;es on his voyage to Cuba, when his mind was clouded by &s;orrow, and he forgot that
<PB N="165" REF="166">
he had a wife and children. What we are lo&s;ing ever &s;eems to us the mo&s;t precious. Gonzalvo was quitting Spain for ever, and therefore was Spain dearer to his eyes than all el&s;e which the world contained. Read them, Don Lorenzo, they will give you &s;ome idea of the feelings of a bani&s;hed man."</P>
<P>Elvira put a paper into Lorenzo's hand, and retired from the chamber. The youth examined the contents, and found them to be as follows:

<P>Lorenzo had &s;carcely time to read the&s;e lines, when Elvira returned to him: the giving a free cour&s;e to her tears had relieved her, and her &s;pirits had regained their u&s;ual compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>"I have nothing more to &s;ay, my lord," &s;aid &s;he; "you have heard my apprehen|&s;ions, and my rea&s;ons for begging you not to repeat your vi&s;its. I have thrown my&s;elf in full confidence upon your honour. I am certain that you will not prove my opinion of you to have been too favourable."</P>
<P>"But one que&s;tion more, Segnora, and I leave you. Should the duke of Medina
<PB N="169" REF="170">
approve my love, would my addre&s;&s;es be unacceptable to your&s;elf and the fair An|tonia?"</P>
<P>"I will be open with you, Don Lorenzo: there being little probability of &s;uch an union taking place, I fear that it is de&s;ired but too ardently by my daughter. You have made an impre&s;&s;ion upon her young heart which gives me the mo&s;t &s;erious alarm: to prevent that impre&s;&s;ion from growing &s;tronger; I am obliged to decline your ac|quaintance. For me, you may be &s;ure that I &s;hould rejoice at e&s;tabli&s;hing my child &s;o advantageou&s;ly. Con&s;cious that my con&s;ti|tution, impaired by grief and illne&s;s, forbids me to expect a long continuance in this world, I tremble at the thought of leaving her under the protection of a perfect &s;tranger. The marquis de las Ci&s;ternas is totally un|known to me. He will marry: his lady may look upon Antonia with an eye of di&s;|plea&s;ure, and deprive her of her only friend. Should the duke, your uncle, give his con|&s;ent,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
you need not doubt obtaining mine and my daughter's; but, without his, hope not for ours. At all events, whatever &s;teps you may take, whatever may be the duke's deci&s;ion, till you know it, let me beg your forbearing to &s;trengthen, by your pre&s;ence, Antonia's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If the &s;anction of your relations authori&s;es your addre&s;&s;ing her as your wife, my doors fly open to you. If that &s;anction is refu&s;ed, be &s;atisfied to po&s;&s;e&s;s my e&s;teem and gratitude, but re|member that we mu&s;t meet no more."</P>
<P>Lorenzo promi&s;ed reluctantly to conform to this decree: but he added, that he hoped &s;oon to obtain that con&s;ent, which would give him a claim to the renewal of their ac|quaintance. He then explained to her why the marquis had not called in per&s;on; and made no &s;cruple of confiding to her his &s;i&s;ter's hi&s;tory. He concluded by &s;aying, "that he hoped to &s;et Agnes at liberty the next day; and that, as &s;oon as Don Ray|mond's fears were quieted upon this &s;ubject,
<PB N="171" REF="172">
he would lo&s;e no time in a&s;&s;uring Donna Elvira of his friend&s;hip and protection."</P>
<P>The lady &s;hook her head.</P>
<P>"I tremble for your &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid &s;he; "I have heard many traits of the domina of St. Clare's character from a friend who was educated in the &s;ame convent with her: &s;he reported her to be haughty, inflexible, &s;u|per&s;titious, and revengeful. I have &s;ince heard, that &s;he is infatuated with the idea of rendering her convent the mo&s;t regular in Madrid, and never forgave tho&s;e who&s;e im|prudence threw upon it the &s;lighted &s;tain. Though naturally violent and &s;evere, when her intere&s;ts require it, &s;he well knows how to a&s;&s;ume an appearance of benignity. She leaves no means untried to per&s;uade young women of rank to become members of her community: &s;he is implacable when once incen&s;ed, and has too much intrepidity to &s;hrink at taking the mo&s;t rigorous mea&s;ures for puni&s;hing the offender. Doubtle&s;s, &s;he will con&s;ider your &s;i&s;ter's quitting the con|vent
<PB N="172" REF="173">
as a di&s;grace thrown upon it: &s;he will u&s;e every artifice to avoid obeying the man|date of his holine&s;s; and I &s;hudder to think that Donna Agnes is in the hands of this dangerous woman."</P>
<P>Lorenzo now ro&s;e to take leave. Elvira gave him her hand at parting, which he ki&s;&s;ed re&s;pectfully; and, telling her that he &s;oon hoped for the permi&s;&s;ion to &s;alute that of Antonia, he returned to his hotel. The lady was perfectly &s;atisfied with the conver|&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between them: &s;he looked forward with &s;atisfaction to the pro|&s;pect of his becoming her &s;on-in-law; but prudence bade her conceal from her daugh|ter's knowledge the flattering hopes which her&s;elf now ventured to entertain.</P>
<P>Scarcely was it day, and already Lorenzo was at the convent of St. Clare, furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;ary mandate. The nuns were at matins. He waited impatiently for the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ervice; and at length the priore&s;s appeared at the parlour-grate. Ag|nes
<PB N="173" REF="174">
was demanded. The old lady replied with a melancholy air, that the dear child's &s;ituation grew hourly more dangerous: that the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of her life; but that they had declared the only chance for her recovery to con&s;i&s;t in keeping her quiet, and not to permit tho&s;e to approach her who&s;e pre&s;ence was likely to agitate her. Not a word of all this was believed by Lorenzo, any more than he credited the expre&s;&s;ions of grief and affection for Agnes with which this account was interlarded. To end the bu&s;ine&s;s, he put the pope's bull into the hands of the domina, and in&s;i&s;ted that, ill or in health, his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be delivered to him without delay.</P>
<P>The priore&s;s received the paper with an air of humility; but no &s;ooner had her eye glanced over the contents than her re&s;ent|ment baffled all the efforts of hypocri&s;y. A deep crim&s;on &s;pread it&s;elf over her face, and &s;he darted upon Lorenzo looks of rage and menace.</P>
<P>"This order is po&s;itive," &s;aid &s;he, in a
<PB N="174" REF="175">
voice of anger, which &s;he in vain &s;trove to di&s;gui&s;e: "willingly would I obey it, but, unfortunately, it is out of my power."</P>
<P>Lorenzo interrupted her by an exclama|tion of &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"I repeat it, Segnor, to obey this order is totally out of my power. From tender|ne&s;s to a brother's feelings, I would have communicated the &s;ad event to you by de|grees, and have prepared you to hear it with fortitude. My mea&s;ures are broken through: this order commands me to deliver up to you the &s;i&s;ter Agnes without delay; I am, therefore, obliged to inform you, without circumlocution, that on Friday la&s;t &s;he ex|pired."</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;tarted back with horror, and turned pale. A moment's recollection con|vinced him that this a&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and it re&s;tored him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"You deceive me!" &s;aid he, pa&s;&s;ionately: "but five minutes pa&s;t you a&s;&s;ured me that, though ill, &s;he was &s;till alive. Pro|duce her this in&s;tant! See her I mu&s;t and
<PB N="175" REF="176">
will; and every attempt to keep her from me will be unavailing."</P>
<P>"You forget your&s;elf, Segnor: you owe re&s;pect to my age as well as my profe&s;&s;ion. Your &s;i&s;ter is no more. If I at fir&s;t con|cealed her death, it was from dreading le&s;t an event &s;o unexpected &s;hould produce on you too violent an effect. In truth, I am but ill repaid for my attention. And what intere&s;t, I pray you, &s;hould I have in de|taining her? To know her wi&s;h of quitting our &s;ociety is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for me to wi&s;h her ab&s;ence, and think her a di&s;grace to the &s;i&s;terhood of St. Clare: but &s;he has forfeited my affection in a manner yet more culpable. Her crimes were great; and when you know the cau&s;e of her death, you will doubtle&s;s rejoice, Don Lorenzo, that &s;uch a wretch is no longer in exi&s;tence. She was taken ill on Thur&s;day la&s;t on returning from confe&s;&s;ion in the Capuchin chapel: her malady &s;eemed attended with &s;trange circum&s;tances; but &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in con|cealing its cau&s;e. Thanks to the Virgin,
<PB N="176" REF="177">
we were too ignorant to &s;u&s;pect it! Judge then what mu&s;t have been our con&s;ternation, our horror, when &s;he was delivered the next day of a &s;till-born child, whom &s;he imme|diately followed to the grave. How, Seg|nor? Is it po&s;&s;ible that your countenance expre&s;&s;es no &s;urpri&s;e, no indignation? Is it po&s;&s;ible that your &s;i&s;ter's infamy was known to you, and that &s;till &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your af|fection? In that ca&s;e, you have no need of my compa&s;&s;ion. I can &s;ay nothing more, except repeat my inability of obeying the orders of his holine&s;s. Agnes is no more; and, to convince you that what I &s;ay is true, I &s;wear by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, that three days have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince &s;he was buried."</P>
<P>Here &s;he ki&s;&s;ed a &s;mall crucifix which hung at her girdle: &s;he then ro&s;e from her chair, and quitted the parlour. As &s;he with|drew &s;he ca&s;t upon Lorenzo a &s;cornful &s;mile.</P>
<P>"Farewell, Segnor," &s;aid &s;he; "I know no remedy for this accident. I fear that even a &s;econd bull from the pope will not procure your &s;i&s;ter's re&s;urrection."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">Lorenzo al&s;o retired, penetrated with af|fliction: but Don Raymond's, at the news of this event, amounted to madne&s;s: he would not be convinced that Agnes was really dead; and continued to in&s;i&s;t that the walls of St. Clare &s;till confined her. No arguments could make him abandon his hopes of regaining her. Every day &s;ome fre&s;h &s;cheme was invented for procuring in|telligence of her, and all of them were at|tended with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>On his part, Medina gave up the idea of ever &s;eeing his &s;i&s;ter more; yet he believed that &s;he had been taken off by unfair means. Under this per&s;ua&s;ion, he encouraged Don Raymond's re&s;earches, determined, &s;hould he di&s;cover the lea&s;t warrant for his &s;u&s;pi|cions, to take a &s;evere vengeance upon the unfeeling priore&s;s. The lo&s;s of his &s;i&s;ter af|fected him &s;incerely: nor was it the lea&s;t cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s, that propriety obliged him for &s;ome time to defer mentioning An|tonia to the duke. In the mean while, his emi&s;&s;aries con&s;tantly &s;urrounded Elvira's

door. He had intelligence of all the move|ments of his mi&s;tre&s;s. As &s;he never failed every Thur&s;day to attend the &s;ermon in the Capuchin cathedral, he was &s;ecure of &s;eeing her once a week; though, in compliance with his promi&s;e, he carefully &s;hunned her ob&s;ervation. Thus two long months pa&s;&s;ed away. Still no information was procured of Agnes. All but the marquis credited her death: and now Lorenzo determined to di&s;clo&s;e his &s;entiments to his uncle: he had already dropped &s;ome hints of his in|tention to marry: they had been as favour|ably received as he could expert; and he harboured no doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s of his application.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE bur&s;t of tran&s;port was pa&s;&s;ed: Am|bro&s;io's lu&s;t was &s;atisfied. Plea&s;ure fled, and Shame u&s;urped her &s;eat in his bo&s;om. Con|fu&s;ed and terrified at his weakne&s;s, he drew him&s;elf from Matilda's arms: his perjury pre&s;ented it&s;elf before him: he reflected on the &s;cene which had ju&s;t been acted, and trembled at the con&s;equences of a di&s;covery: he looked forward with horror: his heart was de&s;pondent, and became the abode of &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t: he avoided the eyes of his partner in frailty. A melancholy &s;ilence prevailed, during which both &s;eemed bu&s;ied with di&s;agreeable reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181">Matilda was the fir&s;t to break it. She took his hand gently, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her burning lips.</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io!" &s;he murmured, in a &s;oft and trembling voice.</P>
<P>The abbot &s;tarted at the &s;ound: he turned his eyes upon Matilda's; they were filled with tears; her cheeks were covered with blu&s;hes, and her &s;upplicating looks &s;eemed to &s;olicit his compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Dangerous woman!" &s;aid he; "into what an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery have you plunged me! Should your &s;ex be di&s;covered, my honour, nay, my life, mu&s;t pay for the plea&s;ure of a few moments. Fool that I was, to tru&s;t my&s;elf to your &s;eductions! What can now be done? How can my offence be expiated? What atonement can purcha&s;e the pardon of my crime? Wretched Matilda, you have de&s;troyed my quiet for ever!"</P>
<P>"To me the&s;e reproaches, Ambro&s;io? to me, who have &s;acrificed for you the world's plea&s;ures, the luxury of wealth, the
<PB N="181" REF="182">
delicacy of &s;ex, my friends, my fortune, and my fame? What have you lo&s;t which I pre&s;erved? Have <HI>I</HI> not &s;hared in <HI>your</HI> guilt? Have <HI>you</HI> not &s;hared in <HI>my</HI> plea&s;ure? Guilt, did I &s;ay? In what con&s;i&s;ts ours, un|le&s;s in the opinion of an ill judging world? Let that world be ignorant of them, and our joys become divine and blamele&s;s! Un|natural were your vows of celibacy; man was not created for &s;uch a &s;tate: and were love a crime, God never would have made it &s;o &s;weet, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible! Then bani&s;h tho&s;e clouds from your brow, my Ambro&s;io. Indulge in tho&s;e plea&s;ures freely, without which life is a worthle&s;s gift. Cea&s;e to re|proach me with having taught you what is bli&s;s, and feel equal tran&s;ports with the woman who adores you!"</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, her eyes were filled with a delicious languor: her bo&s;om panted: &s;he twined her arms voluptuou&s;ly round him, drew him towards her, and glued her lips to his. Ambro&s;io again raged with de&s;ire: the die was thrown: his vows were already
<PB N="182" REF="183">
broken: he had already committed the crime, and why &s;hould he refrain from enjoying its reward? He cla&s;ped her to his brea&s;t with redoubled ardour. No longer repre&s;&s;ed by the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, he gave a loo&s;e to his intemperate appetites; while the fair wanton put every invention of lu&s;t in practice, every refinement in the art of plea&s;ure, which might heighten the bli&s;s of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and render her lover's tran&s;ports &s;till more exqui&s;ite. Ambro&s;io rioted in delights till then unknown to him. Swift fled the night, and the morning blu&s;hed to behold him &s;till cla&s;ped in the embraces of Matilda.</P>
<P>Intoxicated with plea&s;ure, the monk ro&s;e from the &s;yren's luxurious couch: he no longer reflected with &s;hame upon his inconti|nence, or dreaded the vengeance of offended heaven: his only fear was le&s;t death &s;hould rob him of enjoyments, for which his long fa&s;t had only given a keener edge to his ap|petite. Matilda was &s;till under the influ|ence of poi&s;on; and the voluptuous monk trembled le&s;s for his pre&s;erver's life than his
<PB N="183" REF="184">
concubine's. Deprived of her, he would not ea&s;ily find another mi&s;tre&s;s with whom he could indulge his pa&s;&s;ions &s;o fully, and &s;o &s;afely; he therefore pre&s;&s;ed her with earne&s;tne&s;s to u&s;e the means of pre&s;ervation which &s;he had declared to be in her po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Yes!" replied Matilda; "&s;ince you have made me feel that life is valuable, I will re&s;cue mine at any rate. No dangers &s;hall appal me: I will look upon the con&s;equences of my action boldly, nor &s;hudder at the hor|rors which they pre&s;ent: I will think my &s;acrifice &s;carcely worthy to purcha&s;e your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and remember, that a moment pa&s;&s;ed in your arms in this world, o'erpays an age of puni&s;hment in the next. But be|fore I take this &s;tep, Ambro&s;io, give me your &s;olemn oath never to enquire by what means I &s;hall pre&s;erve my&s;elf."</P>
<P>He did &s;o, in a manner the mo&s;t bind|ing.</P>
<P>"I thank you, my beloved. This pre|caution is nece&s;&s;ary; for, though you know
<PB N="184" REF="185">
it not, you are under the command of vul|gar prejudices. The bu&s;ine&s;s on which I mu&s;t be employed this night might &s;tartle you, from its &s;ingularity, and lower me in your opinion. Tell me, are you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the key of the low door on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the garden?"</P>
<P>"The door which opens into the bury|ing-ground common to us and the &s;i&s;ter|hood of St. Clare? I have not the key, but can ea&s;ily procure it."</P>
<P>"You have only this to do. Admit me into the burying-ground at midnight. Watch while I de&s;cend into the vaults of St. Clare, le&s;t &s;ome prying eye &s;hould ob|&s;erve my actions. Leave me there alone for an hour, and that life is &s;afe which I de|dicate to your plea&s;ures. To prevent cre|ating &s;u&s;picion, do not vi&s;it me during the day. Remember the key, and that I expect you before twelve. Hark! I hear &s;teps ap|proaching! Leave me; I will pretend to &s;leep."</P>
<P>The friar obeyed, and left the cell. As
<PB N="185" REF="186">
he opened the door, father Pablos made his appearance.</P>
<P>"I come," &s;aid the latter, "to enquire after the health of my young patient."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" replied Ambro&s;io, laying his finger upon his lip; "&s;peak &s;oftly; I am ju&s;t come from him: he has fallen into a profound &s;lumber, which doubtle&s;s will be of &s;ervice to him. Do not di&s;turb him at pre&s;ent, for he wi&s;hes to repo&s;e."</P>
<P>Father Pablos obeyed, and, hearing the bell ring, accompanied the abbot to matins. Ambro&s;io felt embarra&s;&s;ed as he entered the chapel. Guilt was new to him, and he fancied that every eye could read the tran&s;|actions of the night upon his countenance. He &s;trove to pray: his bo&s;om no longer glowed with devotion: his thoughts in&s;en|&s;ibly wandered to Matilda's &s;ecret charms.  <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut what he wanted in purity of heart, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">upplied by exterior &s;anctity.

<PB N="186" REF="187">
than &s;ince he had broken through his engage|ments. Thus did he uncon&s;ciou&s;ly add hy|pocri&s;y to perjury and incontinence: he had fallen into the latter errors from yielding to &s;eduction almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible; but he was now guilty of a voluntary fault, by endeavouring to conceal tho&s;e into which another had be|trayed him.</P>
<P>The matins concluded, Ambro&s;io retired to his cell. The plea&s;ures which he had ju&s;t ta&s;ted for the fir&s;t time were &s;till im|pre&s;&s;ed upon his mind: his brain was be|wildered, and pre&s;ented a confu&s;ed chaos of remor&s;e, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, inquietude, and fear: he looked back with regret to that peace of &s;oul, that &s;ecurity of virtue, which till then had been his portion: he had in|dulged in exce&s;&s;es who&s;e very idea, but four-and-twenty hours before, he had recoiled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with horror: he &s;huddered at reflecting tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a trifling indi&s;cretion on his part, or on Ma+tilda's, would overturn that fabric of repu+tation which it had co&s;t him thirty years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> erect, and render him the abhorrence of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="187" REF="188">
people of whom he was then the idol. Con|&s;cience painted to him in glaring colours his perjury, and weakne&s;s; apprehen&s;ion magni|fied to him the honors of puni&s;hment, and he already fancied him&s;elf in the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition. To the&s;e tormenting ideas &s;ucceeded Matilda's beauty, and tho&s;e de|licious le&s;&s;ons, which once learnt can never be forgotten. A &s;ingle glance thrown upon the&s;e reconciled him with him&s;elf: he con|&s;idered the plea&s;ures of the former night to have been purcha&s;ed at an ea&s;y price by the &s;acrifice of innocence and honour. Their very remembrance filled his &s;oul with ec|&s;tacy: he cur&s;ed his fooli&s;h vanity, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad induced him to wa&s;te in ob&s;curity the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loom of life, ignorant of the ble&s;&s;ings of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re and woman: he determined, at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ents, to continue his commerce with Ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">da, and called every argument to his aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich might confirm his re&s;olution: he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed him&s;elf, provided his irregularity was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">known, in what would his fault con&s;i&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d what con&s;equences he had to apprehend?
<PB N="188" REF="189">
By adhering &s;trictly to every rule of his or|der &s;ave cha&s;tity, he doubted not to retain the e&s;teem of men, and even the protection of heaven: he tru&s;ted ea&s;ily to be forgiven &s;o &s;light and natural a deviation from his vows; but he forgot that, having pronounced tho&s;e vows, incontinence, in laymen the mo&s;t venial of errors, became in his per&s;on the mo&s;t heinous of crimes.</P>
<P>Once decided upon his future conduct, his mind became more ea&s;y: he threw him|&s;elf upon his bed, and &s;trove by &s;leeping to recruit his &s;trength, exhau&s;ted by his noc+turnal exce&s;&s;es. He awoke refre&s;hed, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eager for a repetition of his plea&s;ures.

fate of a youth who&s;e talents had appeared &s;o promi&s;ing.</P>
<P>The night arrived. Ambro&s;io had taken care to procure from the porter the key of the low door opening into the cemetery. Furni&s;hed with this, when all was &s;ilent in the mona&s;tery, he quitted his cell, and ha&s;|tened to Matilda's. She had left her bed, and was dre&s;&s;ed before his arrival.</P>
<P>"I have been expecting you with impa|tience," &s;aid &s;he; "my life depends upon the&s;e moments. Have you the key?"</P>
<P>"I have."</P>
<P>"Away then to the garden. We have no time to lo&s;e. Follow me!"</P>
<P>She took a &s;mall covered ba&s;ket from the table. Bearing this in one hand, and the lamp, which was flaming upon the hearth, in the other, &s;he ha&s;tened from the cell. Ambro&s;io followed her. Both maintained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> profound &s;ilence. She moved on with quick but cautious &s;teps, pa&s;&s;ed through the cloi&s;ters, and reached the we&s;tern &s;ide of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arden; her eyes fla&s;hed with a fire and
<PB N="190" REF="191">
wildne&s;s which impre&s;&s;ed the monk at once with awe and horror. A determined de&s;|perate courage reigned upon her brow: &s;he gave the lamp to Ambro&s;io; then taking from him the key, &s;he unlocked the low door, and entered the cemetery. It was a va&s;t and &s;pacious &s;quare, planted with yew-trees; half of it belonged to the abbey, the other half was the property of the &s;i&s;terhood of St. Clare, and was protected by a roof of &s;tone: the divi&s;ion was marked by an iron railing, the wicket of which was gene|rally left unlocked.</P>
<P>Thither Matilda bent her cour&s;e: &s;he opened the wicket, and &s;ought for the door leading to the &s;ubterraneous vaults where re|po&s;ed the mouldering bodies of the votaries of St. Clare. The night was perfectly dark&punc; neither moon nor &s;tars were vi&s;ible. Luckily there was not a breath of wind, and the fria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bore his lamp in full &s;ecurity: by the a&s;&s;i&s;t+ance of its beams, the door of the &s;epulchr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was &s;oon di&s;covered. It was &s;unk within th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hollow of a wall, and almo&s;t concealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

thick fe&s;toons of ivy hanging over it. Three &s;teps of rough-hewn &s;tone conducted to it, and Matilda was on the point of de&s;cend|ing them, when &s;he &s;uddenly &s;tarted back.</P>
<P>"There are people in the vaults!" &s;he whi&s;pered to the monk; "conceal your&s;elf till they are pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>She took refuge behind a lofty and mag|nificent tomb, erected in honour of the con|vent's foundre&s;s. Ambro&s;io followed her example, carefully hiding his lamp, le&s;t its beams &s;hould betray them. But a few mo|ments had elap&s;ed when the door was pu&s;hed open leading to the &s;ubterraneous caverns. Rays of light proceeded up the &s;tair-ca&s;e: they enabled the concealed &s;pectators to ob|&s;erve two females dre&s;&s;ed in religious habits, who &s;eemed engaged in earne&s;t conver&s;ation. The abbot had no difficulty to recognize the priore&s;s of St. Clare in the fir&s;t, and one of the elder nuns in her companion.</P>
<P>"Every thing is prepared," &s;aid the prio|re&s;s: "her-fate &s;hall be decided to-morrow; all her tears and &s;ighs will be unavailing.

No! In five-and-twenty years that I have been &s;uperior of this convent, never did I witne&s;s a tran&s;action more infamous!"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t expect much oppo&s;ition to your will," the other replied in a milder voice: "Agnes has many friends in the convent, and in particular the mother St. Ur&s;ula will e&s;pou&s;e her cau&s;e mo&s;t warmly. In truth, &s;he merits to have friends; and I wi&s;h I could prevail upon you to con&s;ider her youth, and her peculiar &s;ituation.

<P>The mother Camilla &s;eemed not to give up the point, but by this time the nuns were out of hearing. The priore&s;s unlock|ed the door which communicated with St. Clare's chapel, and having entered with her companion, clo&s;ed it again after them.</P>
<P>Matilda now a&s;ked, who was this Agnes with whom the priore&s;s was thus incen&s;ed, and what connexion &s;he could have with Ambro&s;io. He related her adventure; and he added, that &s;ince that time his ideas having undergone a thorough revolution,
<PB N="194" REF="195">
he now felt much compa&s;&s;ion for the unfor|tunate nun.</P>
<P>"I de&s;ign," &s;aid he, "to reque&s;t an au|dience of the domina to-morrow, and u&s;e every means of obtaining a mitigation of her &s;entence."</P>
<P>"Beware of what you do," interrupted Matilda; "your &s;udden change of &s;enti|ment may naturally create &s;urpri&s;e, and may give birth to &s;u&s;picions which it is mo&s;t our intere&s;t to avoid. Rather redouble your outward au&s;terity, and thunder out menaces again&s;t the errors of others, the better to conceal your own. Abandon the nun to her fate. Your interfering might be dangerous, and her imprudence merits to be puni&s;hed: &s;he is unworthy to enjoy love's plea&s;ures, who has not wit enough to conceal them. But in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this tri|fling &s;ubject, I wa&s;te moments which are precious. The night flies apace, and much mu&s;t be done before morning. The nuns are retired, all is &s;afe. Give me the lamp, Ambro&s;io, I mu&s;t de&s;cend alone into the&s;e
<PB N="195" REF="196">
caverns: wait here, and if any one ap|proaches warn me by your voice; but as you value your exi&s;tence, pre&s;ume not to follow me, your life would fall a victim to your imprudent curio&s;ity."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he advanced towards the &s;epulchre, &s;till holding her lamp in one hand, and her little ba&s;ket in the other. She touched the door, it turned &s;lowly upon its grating hinges, and a narrow wind|ing &s;tair-ca&s;e of black marble pre&s;ented it|&s;elf to her eyes. She de&s;cended it; Ambro|&s;io remained above, watching the faint beams of the lamp, as they &s;till receded down the &s;tairs. They di&s;appeared, and he found him&s;elf in total darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Left to him&s;elf, he could not reflect without &s;urpri&s;e on the &s;udden change in Matilda's character and &s;entiments. But a few days had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince &s;he appeared the milde&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t of her &s;ex, devoted to his will, and looking up to him as to a &s;upe|rior being. Now &s;he a&s;&s;umed a &s;ort of cou|rage and manline&s;s in her manners and di&s;|cour&s;e,
<PB N="196" REF="197">
but ill calculated to plea&s;e him. She &s;poke no longer to in&s;inuate, but com|mand: he found him&s;elf unable to cope with her in argument, and was unwillingly obliged to confe&s;s the &s;uperiority of her judgment. Every moment convinced him of the a&s;toni&s;hing powers of her mind; but what &s;he gained in the opinion of the man, &s;he lo&s;t with intere&s;t in the affection of the lover. He regretted Ro&s;ario, the fond, the gentle, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; he grieved that Ma|tilda preferred the virtues of his &s;ex to tho&s;e of her own; and when he thought of her expre&s;&s;ions re&s;pecting the devoted nun, he could not help blaming them as cruel and unfeminine. Pity is a &s;entiment &s;o na|tural, &s;o appropriate to the female charac|ter, that it is &s;carcely a merit for a woman to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, but to be without it is a griev|ous crime. Ambro&s;io could not ea&s;ily for|give his mi&s;tre&s;s for being deficient in this amiable quality. However, though he blamed her in&s;en&s;ibility, he felt the truth of her ob&s;ervations; and though he pitied &s;in|cerely
<PB N="197" REF="198">
the unfortunate Agnes, he re&s;olved to drop the idea of interpo&s;ing in her be|half.</P>
<P>Near an hour had elap&s;ed &s;ince Matilda de&s;cended into the caverns; &s;till &s;he return|ed not. Ambro&s;io's curio&s;ity was excited. He drew near the &s;tair-ca&s;e&mdash;he li&s;tened&mdash;all was &s;ilent, except that at intervals he caught the &s;ound of Matilda's voice, as it wound along the &s;ubteraneous pa&s;&s;ages, and was re|echoed by the &s;epulchre's vaulted roofs. She was at too great a di&s;tance for him to di&s;tingui&s;h her words, and ere they reached him, they were deadened into a low mur|mur. He longed to penetrate into this my&s;tery. He re&s;olved to di&s;obey her in|junctions, and follow her into the cavern. He advanced to the &s;tair-ca&s;e; he had al|ready de&s;cended &s;ome &s;teps, when his cou|rage failed him. He remembered Matilda's menaces if he infringed her orders, and his bo&s;om was filled with a &s;ecret unaccountable awe. He returned up the &s;tairs, re&s;umed
<PB N="198" REF="199">
his former &s;tation, and waited impatiently for the conclu&s;ion of this adventure.</P>
<P>Suddenly he was &s;en&s;ible of a violent &s;hock. An earthquake rocked the ground, the columns which &s;upported the roof un|der which he &s;tood; were &s;o &s;trongly &s;haken, that every moment menaced him with its fall, and at the &s;ame moment he heard a loud and tremendous bur&s;t of thunder; it cea&s;ed, and his eyes being fixed upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e, he &s;aw a bright column of light fla&s;h along the caverns beneath. It was &s;een but for an in&s;tant. No &s;ooner did it di&s;appear, than all was once more quiet and ob&s;cure. Profound darkne&s;s again &s;ur|rounded him, and the &s;ilence of night was only broken by the whirring bat as &s;he flit|ted &s;lowly by him.</P>
<P>With every in&s;tant Ambro&s;io's amaze|ment increa&s;ed. Another hour elap&s;ed, after which the &s;ame light again appeared, and was lo&s;t again as &s;uddenly. It was ac|companied by a &s;train of &s;weet but &s;olemn
<PB N="199" REF="200">
mu&s;ic, which, as it &s;tole through the vaults below, in&s;pired the monk with mingled de|light and terror. It had not long been hu&s;hed, when he heard Matilda's &s;teps upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e. She a&s;cended from the ca|vern; the mo&s;t lively joy animated her beautiful features.</P>
<P>"Did you &s;ee any thing?" &s;he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>"Twice I &s;aw a column of light fla&s;h up the &s;tair-ca&s;e."</P>
<P>"Nothing el&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Nothing.</P>
<P>"The morning is on the point of break|ing, let us retire to the abbey, le&s;t day-light &s;hould betray us."</P>
<P>With a light &s;tep &s;he ha&s;tened from the burying-ground. She regained her cell, and the curious abbot &s;till accompanied her. She clo&s;ed the door, and di&s;embarra&s;&s;ed her&s;elf of her lamp and ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ucceeded!" &s;he cried, throw|ing her&s;elf upon his bo&s;om; "&s;ucceeded beyond my fonde&s;t hopes! I &s;hall live, Am|bro&s;io, &s;hall live for you! the &s;tep, which
<PB N="200" REF="201">
I &s;huddered at taking, proves to me a &s;ource of joys inexpre&s;&s;ible! Oh! that I dared communicate tho&s;e joys to you! Oh! that I were permitted to &s;hare with you my power, and rai&s;e you as high above the level of your &s;ex, as one bold deed has ex|alted me above mine!"</P>
<P>"And what prevents you, Matilda?" interrupted the friar, "Why is your bu|&s;ine&s;s in the cavern made a &s;ecret? Do you think me unde&s;erving of your confidence? Matilda, I mu&s;t doubt the truth of your af|fection, while you have joys in which I am forbidden to &s;hare."</P>
<P>"You reproach me with inju&s;tice; I grieve &s;incerely that I am obliged to con|ceal from you my happine&s;s: but I am not to blame; the fault lies not in me, but in your&s;elf, my Ambro&s;io. You are &s;till too much the monk, your mind is en&s;laved by the prejudices of education; and &s;uper&s;ti|tion might make you &s;hudder at the idea of that which experience has taught me to prize and value. At pre&s;ent you are unfit
<PB N="201" REF="202">
to be tru&s;ted with a &s;ecret of &s;uch impor|tance; but the &s;trength of your judgment, and the curio&s;ity which I rejoice to &s;ee &s;park|ling in your eyes, makes me hope that you will one day de&s;erve my confidence. Till that period arrives, re&s;train your impatience. Remember that you have given me your &s;olemn oath, never to enquire into this night's adventures. I in&s;i&s;t upon your keeping this oath; for, though," &s;he added &s;miling, while &s;he &s;ealed his lips with a wanton ki&s;s, "though I forgive your break|ing your vows to heaven, I expect you to keep your vows to me."</P>
<P>The friar returned the embrace, which had &s;et his blood on fire. The luxurious and unbounded exce&s;&s;es of the former night were renewed, and they &s;eparated not till the bell rang for matins.</P>
<P>The &s;ame plea&s;ures were frequently re|peated. The monks rejoiced in the feign|ed Ro&s;ario's unexpected recovery, and none of them &s;u&s;pected his real &s;ex. The
<PB N="202" REF="203">
abbot po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mi&s;tre&s;s in tranquillity, and, perceiving his frailty un&s;u&s;pected, abandoned him&s;elf to his pa&s;&s;ions in full &s;ecurity. Shame and remor&s;e no longer tormented him. Frequent repetitions made him familiar with &s;in, and his bo&s;om became proof again&s;t the &s;tings of con&s;cience. In the&s;e &s;entiments he was encouraged by Matilda; but &s;he &s;oon was aware that &s;he had &s;atiated her lover by the unbounded freedom of her care&s;&s;es. Her charms be|coming accu&s;tomed to him, they cea&s;ed to excite the &s;ame de&s;ires which at fir&s;t they had in&s;pired. The delirium of pa&s;&s;ion being pa&s;t, he had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve every trifling defect; where none were to be found, &s;atiety made him fancy them. The monk was glutted with the fullne&s;s of plea|&s;ure. A week had &s;carcely elap&s;ed, before he was wearied of his paramour: his warm con&s;titution &s;till made him &s;eek in her arms the gratification of his lu&s;t. But when the moment of pa&s;&s;ion was over, he quitted her
<PB N="203" REF="204">
with di&s;gu&s;t, and his humour, naturally in|con&s;tant, made him &s;igh impatiently for variety.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which cloys man, only in|crea&s;es the affection of women. Matilda with every &s;ucceeding day grew more at|tached to the friar. Since he had obtained her favours, he was become dearer to her than ever, and &s;he felt grateful to him for the plea&s;ures in which they had equally been &s;harers. Unfortunately as her pa&s;&s;ion grew ardent, Ambro&s;io's grew cold; the very marks of her fondne&s;s excited his di&s;|gu&s;t, and its exce&s;s &s;erved to extingui&s;h the flame which already burned but feebly in his bo&s;om. Matilda could not but remark that her &s;ociety &s;eemed to him daily le&s;s agreeable; he was inattentive while &s;he &s;poke; her mu&s;ical talents, which &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in perfection, had lo&s;t the power of amu&s;ing him; or if he deigned to prai&s;e them, his compliments were evidently forced and cold. He no longer gazed upon her with affection, or applauded her &s;enti|ments
<PB N="204" REF="205">
with a lover's partiality. This Ma|tilda well perceived, and redoubled her ef|forts to revive tho&s;e &s;entiments which he once had felt. She could not but fail, &s;ince he con&s;idered as importunities, the pains which &s;he took to plea&s;e him, and was di&s;|gu&s;ted by the very means which &s;he u&s;ed to recall the wanderer. Still, however, their illicit commerce continued; but it was clear that he was led to her arms, not by love, but the cravings of brutal appetite. His con|&s;titution made a woman nece&s;&s;ary to him, and Matilda was the only one with whom he could indulge his pa&s;&s;ions &s;afely. In &s;pite of her beauty, he gazed upon every other female with more de&s;ire; but fearing that his hypocri&s;y &s;hould be made public, he confined his inclinations to his own brea&s;t.</P>
<P>It was by no means his nature to be ti|mid: but his education had impre&s;&s;ed his mind with fear &s;o &s;trongly, that apprehen|&s;ion was now become part of his character. Had his youth been pa&s;&s;ed in the world, he would have &s;hown him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="205" REF="206">
many brilliant and manly qualities. He was naturally enterprizing, firm, and fear|le&s;s: he had a warrior's heart, and he might have &s;hone with &s;plendour at the head of an army. There was no want of genero|&s;ity in his nature: the wretched never failed to find in him a compa&s;&s;ionate auditor: his abilities were quick and &s;hining, and his judgment va&s;t, &s;olid, and deci&s;ive. With &s;uch qualifications he would have been an ornament to his country: that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them he had given proofs in his earlie&s;t in|fancy, and his parents had beheld his dawn|ing virtues with the fonde&s;t delight and ad|miration. Unfortunately, while yet a child, he was deprived of tho&s;e parents. He fell into the power of a relation, who&s;e only wi&s;h about him was never to hear of him more: for that purpo&s;e he gave him in charge to his friend, the former &s;uperior of the Capuchins. The abbot, a very monk, u&s;ed all his endeavours to per&s;uade the boy that happine&s;s exi&s;ted not without the walls of a convent. He &s;ucceeded fully. To de|&s;erve
<PB N="206" REF="207">
admittance into the order of St. Fran|cis was Ambro&s;io's highe&s;t ambition. His in&s;tructors carefully repre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e virtues, who&s;e grandeur and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s were ill &s;uited to the cloi&s;ter. In&s;tead of univer|&s;al benevolence, he adopted a &s;elfi&s;h parti|ality for his own particular e&s;tabli&s;hment: he was taught to con&s;ider compa&s;&s;ion for the errors of others as a crime of the blacke&s;t dye: the noble frankne&s;s of his temper was exchanged for &s;ervile humility; and in or|der to break his natural &s;pirit, the monks terrified his young mind, by placing before him all the horrors with which &s;uper&s;tition could furni&s;h them: they painted to him the torments of the damned in colours the mo&s;t dark, terrible and fanta&s;tic, and threa|tened him at the &s;lighte&s;t fault with eternal perdition. No wonder that his imagina|tion con&s;tantly dwelling upon the&s;e fearful objects &s;hould have rendered his character timid and apprehen&s;ive. Add to this, that his long ab&s;ence from the great world, and total unacquaintance with the common dan|gers
<PB N="207" REF="208">
of life, made him form of them an idea far more di&s;mal than the reality. While the monks were bu&s;ied in rooting out his virtues, and narrowing his &s;entiments, they allowed every vice which had fallen to his &s;hare to arrive at full perfection. He was &s;uffered to be proud, vain, ambitious, and di&s;dainful: he was jealous of his equals, and de&s;pi&s;ed all merit but his own: he was implacable when offended, and cruel in his revenge. Still in &s;pite of the pains taken to pervert them, his natural good qualities would occa&s;ionally break through the gloom, ca&s;t over them &s;o carefully. At &s;uch times the conte&s;t for &s;uperiority between his real and acquired character was &s;triking and un|accountable to tho&s;e unacquainted with his original di&s;po&s;ition. He pronounced the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;entences upon offenders, which the moment after compa&s;&s;ion induced him to mitigate: he undertook the mo&s;t daring enterprizes, which the fear of their con&s;e|quences &s;oon obliged him to abandon: his inborn genius darted a brilliant light upon
<PB N="208" REF="209">
&s;ubjects the mo&s;t ob&s;cure; and almo&s;t in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly his &s;uper&s;tition replunged them in darkne&s;s more profound than that from which they had ju&s;t been re&s;cued. His brother monks, regarding him as a &s;u|perior being, remarked not this contradic|tion in their idol's conduct. They were per&s;uaded that what he did mu&s;t be right, and &s;uppo&s;ed him to have good rea&s;ons for changing his re&s;olutions. The fact was, that the different &s;entiments with which education and nature had in&s;pired him, were combating in his bo&s;om: it remained for his pa&s;&s;ions, which as yet no opportu|nity had called into play, to decide the vic|tory. Unfortunately his pa&s;&s;ions were the very wor&s;t judges to whom he could po&s;&s;i|bly have applied. His mona&s;tic &s;eclu&s;ion had till now been in his favour, &s;ince it gave him no room for di&s;covering his bad qua|lities. The &s;uperiority of his talents rai&s;ed him too far above his companions to per|mit his being jealous of them: his exem|plary piety, per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, and
<PB N="209" REF="210">
plea&s;ing manners had &s;ecured him univer|&s;al e&s;teem, and con&s;equently he had no in|juries to revenge: his ambition was ju&s;ti|fied by his acknowledged merit, and his pride con&s;idered as no more than proper confidence. He never &s;aw, much le&s;s con|ver&s;ed with the other &s;ex: he was ignorant of the plea&s;ures in woman's power to be|&s;tow; and if he read in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies
<Q>That men were fond, he &s;miled, and wondered how.</Q></P>
<P>For a time &s;pare diet, frequent watching, and &s;evere penance cooled and repre&s;&s;ed the natural warmth of his con&s;titution: but no &s;ooner did opportunity pre&s;ent it&s;elf, no &s;ooner did he catch a glimp&s;e of joys to which he was &s;till a &s;tranger, than religion's barriers were too feeble to re&s;i&s;t the over|whelming torrent of his de&s;ires. All im|pediments yielded before the force of his temperament, warm, &s;anguine, and volup|tuous in the exce&s;s. As yet his other pa&s;|&s;ions lay dormant; but they only needed to
<PB N="210" REF="211">
be once awakened, to di&s;play them&s;elves with violence as great and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>He continued to be the admiration of Madrid. The enthu&s;ia&s;m created by his eloquence &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h. Every Thur&s;day, which was the only day when he appeared in public, the Capuchin cathedral was crowded with auditors, and his di&s;cour&s;e was always re|ceived with the &s;ame approbation. He was named confe&s;&s;or to all the chief families in Madrid; and no one was counted fa&s;hion|able who was injoined penance by any other than Ambro&s;io. In his re&s;olution of never &s;tirring out of his convent he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted. This circum&s;tance created a &s;till greater opinion of his &s;anctity and &s;elf-denial. A|bove all, the women &s;ang forth his prai&s;es loudly, le&s;s influenced by devotion than by his noble countenance, maje&s;tic air, and well-turned graceful figure. The abbey-door was thronged with carriages from morning to night; and the noble&s;t and
<PB N="211" REF="212">
faire&s;t dames of Madrid confe&s;&s;ed to the abbot their &s;ecret peccadilloes. The eyes of the luxurious friar devoured their charms. Had his penitents con&s;ulted tho&s;e interpre|ters, he would have needed no other means of expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ires. For his misfor|tune, they were &s;o &s;trongly per&s;uaded of his continence, that the po&s;&s;ibility of his harbouring indecent thoughts never once entered their imaginations. The climate's heat, 'tis well known, operates with no &s;mall influence upon the con&s;titutions of the Spa|ni&s;h ladies: but the mo&s;t abandoned would have thought it an ea&s;ier ta&s;k to in&s;pire with pa&s;&s;ion the marble &s;tatue of St. Francis than the cold and rigid heart of the immaculate Ambro&s;io.</P>
<P>On his part, the friar was little acquainted with the depravity of the world: he &s;u&s;pected not that but few of his penitents would have rejected his addre&s;&s;es. Yet had he been better in&s;tructed on this head, the danger attending &s;uch an attempt would have &s;ealed up his lips in &s;ilence. He knew that it
<PB N="212" REF="213">
would be difficult for a woman to keep a &s;ecret &s;o &s;trange and &s;o important as his frailty; and he even trembled, le&s;t Matilda &s;hould betray him. Anxious to pre&s;erve a reputation which was infinitely dear to him, he &s;aw all the ri&s;que of committing it to the power of &s;ome vain giddy female; and as the beauties of Madrid affected only his &s;en&s;es without touching his heart, he forgot them as &s;oon as they were out of his &s;ight. The danger of di&s;covery, the fear of being repul&s;ed, the lo&s;s of reputation; all the&s;e con&s;iderations coun&s;elled him to &s;tifle his de&s;ires; and though he now felt for it the mo&s;t perfect indifference, he was ne|ce&s;&s;itated to confine him&s;elf to Matilda's per&s;on.</P>
<P>One morning, the confluence of peni|tents was greater than u&s;ual. He was de|tained in the confe&s;&s;ional chair till a late hour. At length the crowd was di&s;patched, and he prepared to quit the chapel, when two females entered, and drew near him with humility. They threw up their veils,
<PB N="213" REF="214">
and the younge&s;t entreated him to li&s;ten to her for a few moments. The melody of her voice, of that voice to which no man ever li&s;tened without intere&s;t, immediately caught Ambro&s;io's attention. He &s;topped. The petitioner &s;eemed bowed down with affliction: her cheeks were pale, her eyes dimmed with tears, and her hair fell in di&s;|order over her face and bo&s;om. Still her countenance was &s;o &s;weet, &s;o innocent, &s;o heavenly, as might have charmed an heart le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible than that which panted in the abbot's brea&s;t. With more than u&s;ual &s;oftne&s;s of manner he de&s;ired her to pro|ceed, and heard her &s;peak as follows, with an emotion which increa&s;ed every moment.</P>
<P>"Reverend father, you &s;ee an unfortu|nate threatened with the lo&s;s of her deare&s;t, of almo&s;t her only friend! My mother, my excellent mother lies upon the bed of &s;ick|ne&s;s. A &s;udden and dreadful malady &s;eized her la&s;t night, and &s;o rapid has been its pro|gre&s;s that the phy&s;icians de&s;pair of her life. Human aid fails me; nothing re|mains
<PB N="214" REF="215">
for me but to implore the mercy of heaven. Father, all Madrid rings with the report of your piety and virtue. Deign to remember my mother in your prayers: per|haps they may prevail on the Almighty to &s;pare her; and &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, I engage my&s;elf every Thur&s;day in the next three months to illuminate the &s;hrine of St. Francis in his honour."</P>
<P>"So!" thought the monk; "here we have a &s;econd Vincentio della Ronda. Ro|&s;ario's adventure began thus;" and he wi&s;hed &s;ecretly that this might have the &s;ame conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>He acceded to the reque&s;t. The peti|tioner returned him thanks with every mark of gratitude, and then continued:</P>
<P>"I have yet another favour to a&s;k. We are &s;trangers in Madrid: my mother needs a confe&s;&s;or, and knows not to whom &s;he &s;hould apply. We under&s;tand that you never quit the abbey, and, alas! my poor mother is unable to come hither! If you would have the goodne&s;s, reverend father,
<PB N="215" REF="216">
to name a proper per&s;on, who&s;e wi&s;e and pious con&s;olations may &s;often the agonies of my parent's death-bed, you will confer an everla&s;ting favour upon hearts not un|grateful."</P>
<P>With this petition al&s;o the monk com|plied. Indeed, what petition would he have refu&s;ed, if urged in &s;uch enchanting accents? The &s;uppliant was &s;o intere&s;ting! Her voice was &s;o &s;weet, &s;o harmonious! Her very tears became her, and her afflic|tion &s;eemed to add new lu&s;tre to her charms. He promi&s;ed to &s;end to her a confe&s;&s;or that &s;ame evening, and begged her to leave her addre&s;s. The companion pre&s;ented him with a card on which it was written, and then withdrew with the fair petitioner, who pronounced before her departure a thou&s;and benedictions on the abbot's goodne&s;s. His eyes followed her out of the chapel. It was not till &s;he was out of &s;ight that he exami|ned the card, on which he read the follow|ing words:</P>
<P>"Donna Elvira Dalfa, &s;trada di San
<PB N="216" REF="217">
Iago, four doors from the palace d'Albor|nos."</P>
<P>The &s;uppliant was no other than Anto|nia, and Leonella was her companion. The latter had not con&s;ented without difficulty to accompany her niece to the abbey: Am|bro&s;io had in&s;pired her with &s;uch awe, that &s;he trembled at the very &s;ight of him. Her fears had conquered even her natural loqua|city, and while in his pre&s;ence &s;he uttered not a &s;ingle &s;yllable.</P>
<P>The monk retired to his cell, whither he was pur&s;ued by Antonia's image. He felt a thou&s;and new emotions &s;pringing in his bo&s;om, and he trembled to examine into the cau&s;e which gave them birth. They were totally different from tho&s;e in&s;pired by Matilda, when &s;he fir&s;t declared her &s;ex and her affection. He felt not the provocation of lu&s;t; no voluptuous de&s;ires rioted in his bo&s;om; nor did a burning imagination pic|ture to him the charms which mode&s;ty had veiled from his eyes. On the contrary, what he now felt was a mingled &s;entiment
<PB N="217" REF="218">
of tenderne&s;s, admiration, and re&s;pect. A &s;oft and delicious melancholy infu&s;ed it&s;elf into his &s;oul, and he would not have ex|changed it for the mo&s;t lively tran&s;ports of joy. Society now di&s;gu&s;ted him: he de|lighted in &s;olitude, which permitted his indulging the vi&s;ions of fancy: his thoughts were all gentle, &s;ad, and &s;oothing; and the whole wide world pre&s;ented him with no other object than Antonia.</P>
<P>"Happy man!" he exclaimed in his ro|mantic enthu&s;ia&s;m, "happy man, who is de&s;tined to po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart of that lovely girl! what delicacy in her features! what elegance in her form! how enchanting was the timid innocence of her eyes! and how different from the wanton expre&s;&s;ion, the wild luxurious fire, which &s;parkles in Ma|tilda's! Oh! &s;weeter mu&s;t one ki&s;s be, &s;natched from the ro&s;y lips of the fir&s;t, than all the full and lu&s;tful favours be&s;towed &s;o freely by the &s;econd. Matilda gluts me with enjoyment even to loathing, forces me to her arms, apes the harlot, and glories in
<PB N="218" REF="219">
her pro&s;titution. Di&s;gu&s;ting! Did &s;he know the inexpre&s;&s;ible charm of mode&s;ty, how irre&s;i&s;tibly it enthrals the heart of man, how firmly it chains him to the throne of beauty, &s;he never would have thrown it off. What would be too dear a price for this lovely girl's affections? What would I refu&s;e to &s;acrifice, could I be relea&s;ed from my vows, and permitted to declare my love in the &s;ight of earth and heaven? While I &s;trove to in&s;pire her with tenderne&s;s, with friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, how tranquil and undi&s;turbed would the hours roll away! Gracious God! to &s;ee her blue downca&s;t eyes beam upon mine with timid fondne&s;s! to &s;it for days, for years, li&s;tening to that gentle voice! to acquire the right of ob|liging her, and hear the artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of her gratitude! to watch the emotions of her &s;potle&s;s heart! to encourage each dawning virtue! to &s;hare in her joy when happy, to ki&s;s away her tears when di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, and to &s;ee her fly to my arms for comfort and &s;upport! Yes; if there is per|fect
<PB N="219" REF="220">
bli&s;s on earth, 'tis his lot alone who be|comes that angel's hu&s;band."</P>
<P>While his fancy coined the&s;e ideas, he paced his cell with a di&s;ordered air. His eyes were fixed upon vacancy: his head reclined upon his &s;houlder: a tear rolled down his cheek, while he reflected that the vi&s;ion of happine&s;s for him could never be realized.</P>
<P>"She is lo&s;t to me;" he continued, "by marriage &s;he cannot be mine: and to &s;e|duce &s;uch innocence, to u&s;e the confidence repo&s;ed in me to work her ruin&mdash;Oh! it would be a crime, blacker than yet the world ever witne&s;&s;ed! Fear not, lovely girl! your virtue runs no ri&s;que from me. Not for Indies would I make that gentle bo&s;om know the tortures of remor&s;e."</P>
<P>Again he paced his chamber ha&s;tily. Then &s;topping, his eye fell upon the picture of his once-admired Madona. He tore it with indignation from the wall: he threw it on the ground, and &s;purned it from him with his foot.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">"The pro&s;titute!"</P>
<P>Unfortunate Matilda! her paramour for|got, that for his &s;ake alone &s;he had forfeited her claim to virtue; and his only rea&s;on for de&s;pi&s;ing her was, that &s;he had loved him much too well.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf into a chair, which &s;tood near the table. He &s;aw the card with Elvira's addre&s;s. He took it up, and it brought to his recollection his promi&s;e re|&s;pecting a confe&s;&s;or. He pa&s;&s;ed a few mi|nutes in doubt: but Antonia's empire over him was already too much decided to per|mit his making a long re&s;i&s;tance to the idea which &s;truck him. He re&s;olved to be the confe&s;&s;or him&s;elf. He could leave the ab|bey unob&s;erved without difficulty: by wrap|ping up his head in his cowl he hoped to pa&s;s through the &s;treets without being re|cogni&s;ed: by taking the&s;e precautions, and by recommending &s;ecre&s;y to Elvira's fa|mily, he doubted not to keep Madrid in ignorance that he had broken his vow ne|ver to &s;ee the out&s;ide of the abbey-walls.
<PB N="221" REF="222">
Matilda was the only per&s;on who&s;e vigilance he dreaded: but by informing her at the refectory, that during the whole of that day bu&s;ine&s;s would confine him to his cell, he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from her wakeful jealou&s;y. Accordingly, at the hours when the Spaniards are generally taking their fie&s;ta, he ventured to quit the abbey by a private door, the key of which was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The cowl of his habit was thrown over his face: from the heat of the weather the &s;treets were almo&s;t totally de|&s;erted: the monk met with few people, found the &s;trada di San Iago, and arrived without accident at Donna Elvira's door. He rang, was admitted, and immediately u&s;hered into an upper apartment.</P>
<P>It was here that he ran the greate&s;t ri&s;que of a di&s;covery. Had Leonella been at home, &s;he would have recognized him di|rectly. Her communicative di&s;po&s;ition would never have permitted her to re&s;t, till all Madrid was informed that Ambro&s;io had ventured out of the abbey, and vi&s;ited
<PB N="222" REF="223">
her &s;i&s;ter. Fortune here &s;tood the monk's friend. On Leonella's return home, &s;he found a letter in&s;tructing her, that a cou&s;in was ju&s;t dead, who had left what little he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed between her&s;elf and Elvira. To &s;ecure this beque&s;t &s;he was obliged to &s;et out for Cordova without lo&s;ing a moment. Amid&s;t all her foibles, her heart was truly warm and affectionate, and &s;he was unwil|ling to quit her &s;i&s;ter in &s;o dangerous a &s;tate. But Elvira in&s;i&s;ted upon her taking the journey, con&s;cious that in her daughter's forlorn &s;ituation, no increa&s;e of fortune, however trifling, ought to be neglected. Accordingly Leonella left Madrid, &s;incere|ly grieved at her &s;i&s;ter's illne&s;s, and giving &s;ome few &s;ighs to the memory of the amia|ble but incon&s;tant Don Chri&s;toval. She was fully per&s;uaded, that at fir&s;t &s;he had made a terrible breach in his heart; but hearing nothing more of him, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that he had quitted the pur&s;uit, di&s;gu&s;ted by the lowne&s;s of her origin, and knowing upon other terms than marriage he had no|thing
<PB N="223" REF="224">
to hope from &s;uch a dragon of virtue as &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf; or el&s;e, that being naturally capricious and changeable, the re|membrance of her charms had been effaced from the Cond&eacute;'s heart by tho&s;e of &s;ome newer beauty. Whatever was the cau&s;e of her lo&s;ing him, &s;he lamented it &s;orely. She &s;trove in vain, as &s;he a&s;&s;ured every body who was kind enough to li&s;ten to her, to tear his image from her too &s;u&s;ceptible heart. She affected the airs of a love &s;ick virgin, and carried them all to the mo&s;t ri|diculous exce&s;s. She heaved lamentable &s;ighs, walked with her arms folded, uttered long &s;oliloquies, and her di&s;cour&s;e generally turned upon &s;ome for&s;aken maid, who ex|pired of a broken heart! Her fiery looks were always ornamented with a garland of willow. Every evening &s;he was &s;een &s;tray|ing upon the banks of a rivulet by moon|light; and &s;he declared her&s;elf a violent admirer of murmuring &s;treams and night|ingales&mdash;</P>
<Q><PB N="224" REF="225">
<L>Of lonely haunts, and twilight groves,</L>
<L>Places which pale pa&s;&s;ion loves!</L></Q>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of Leonella's mind when obliged to quit Madrid. Elvira was out of patience at all the&s;e follies, and en|deavoured at per&s;uading her to act like a rea&s;onable woman. Her advice was thrown away: Leonella a&s;&s;ured her at parting, that nothing could make her forget the perfi|dious Don Chri&s;toval. In this point &s;he was fortunately mi&s;taken. An hone&s;t youth of Cordova, journeyman to an apo|thecary, found that her fortune would be &s;ufficient to &s;et him up in a genteel &s;hop of his own. In con&s;equence of this reflection he avowed him&s;elf her admirer. Leonella was not inflexible; the ardour of his &s;ighs melted her heart, and &s;he &s;oon con&s;ented to make him the happie&s;t of mankind. She wrote to inform her &s;i&s;ter of her marriage; but, for rea&s;ons which will be explained hereafter, Elvira never an&s;wered her let|ter.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="226">Ambro&s;io was conducted into the anti|chamber to that where Elvira was repo&s;ing. The female dome&s;tic who had admitted him, left him alone, while &s;he announced his arrival to her mi&s;tre&s;s. Antonia, who had been by her mother's bed-&s;ide, im|mediately came to him.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, father," &s;aid me, advanc|ing towards him; when recognizing his his features, &s;he &s;topped &s;uddenly, and ut|tered a cry of joy. "Is it po&s;&s;ible?" &s;he continued, "do not my eyes deceive me? Has the worthy Ambro&s;io broken through his re&s;olution, that he may &s;often the ago|nies of the be&s;t of women? What plea&s;ure will this vi&s;it give my mother! Let me not delay for a moment the comfort which your piety and wi&s;dom will afford her."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he opened the chamber-door, pre&s;ented to her mother her di&s;tin|gui&s;hed vi&s;itor, and, having placed an arm|chair by the &s;ide of the bed, withdrew into another apartment.</P>
<P>Elvira was highly gratified by this vi&s;it:
<PB N="226" REF="227">
her expectations had been rai&s;ed high by general report, but &s;he found them far ex|ceeded. Ambro&s;io, endowed by nature with powers of plea&s;ing, exerted them to the utmo&s;t, while conver&s;ing with Antonia's mother. With per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence he calmed every fear, and di&s;&s;ipated every &s;cru|ple. He bid her reflect on the infinite mer|cy of her judge, de&s;poiled death of his darts and terrors, and taught her to view with|out &s;hrinking the aby&s;s of eternity, on who&s;e brink &s;he then &s;tood. Elvira was ab&s;orbed in attention and delight; while &s;he li&s;tened to his exhortations, confidence and comfort &s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly into her mind. She unbo|&s;omed to him without he&s;itation her cares and apprehen&s;ions. The latter re&s;pecting a future life he had already quieted, and he now removed the former, which &s;he felt for the concerns of this. She trembled for Antonia; &s;he had none to who&s;e care &s;he could recommend her, &s;ave to the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, and her &s;i&s;ter Leonella. The protection of the one was very uncer|tain;
<PB N="227" REF="228">
and as to the other, though fond of her niece, Leonella was &s;o thoughtle&s;s and vain, as to make her an improper per&s;on to have the &s;ole direction of a girl &s;o young and ignorant of the world. The friar no &s;ooner learned the cau&s;e of her alarms, than he begged her to make her&s;elf ea&s;y upon that head. He doubted not being able to &s;ecure for Antonia a &s;afe refuge in the hou&s;e of one of his penitents, the marchione&s;s of Villa-Franca: this was a lady of acknow|ledged virtue, remarkable for &s;trict princi|ples and exten&s;ive charity. Should acci|dent deprive her of this re&s;ource, he engag|ed to procure Antonia a reception in &s;ome re&s;pectable convent, that is to &s;ay, in qua|lity of boarder; for Elvira had declared her&s;elf no friend to a mona&s;tic life, and the monk was either candid or complai&s;ant enough to allow that her di&s;approbation was not unfounded.</P>
<P>The&s;e proofs of the intere&s;t which he felt for her, completely won Elvira's heart. In
<PB N="228" REF="229">
thanking him, &s;he exhau&s;ted every ex|pre&s;&s;ion which gratitude could furni&s;h, and prote&s;ted, that now &s;he &s;hould re&s;ign her&s;elf with tranquillity to the grave. Am|bro&s;io ro&s;e to take leave; he promi&s;ed to return the next day at the &s;ame hour, but reque&s;ted that his vi&s;its might be kept &s;e|cret.</P>
<P>"I am unwilling," &s;aid he, "that my breaking through a rule impo&s;ed by nece&s;|&s;ity, &s;hould be generally known. Had I not re&s;olved never to quit my convent, except upon circum&s;tances as urgent as that which has conducted me to your door, I &s;hould be frequently &s;ummoned upon in|&s;ignificant occa&s;ions; that time would be engro&s;&s;ed by the curious, the unoccupied, and the fanciful, which I now pa&s;s at the bed-&s;ide of the &s;ick, in comforting the ex|piring penitent, and clearing the pa&s;&s;age to eternity from thorns."</P>
<P>Elvira commended equally his prudence and compa&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ing to conceal care|fully
<PB N="229" REF="230">
the honour of his vi&s;its. The monk then gave her his benediction, and retired from the chamber.</P>
<P>In the anti-room he found Antonia; he could not refu&s;e him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;|ing a few moments in her &s;ociety. He bid her take comfort, for that her mother &s;eemed compo&s;ed and tranquil, and he hoped that &s;he might yet do well. He en|quired who attended her, and engaged to &s;end the phy&s;ician of his convent to &s;ee her, one of the mo&s;t &s;kilful in Madrid. He then launched out in Elvira's commenda|tion, prai&s;ed her purity and fortitude of mind, and declared that &s;he had in&s;pired him with the highe&s;t e&s;teem and reverence. Antonia's innocent heart &s;welled with gra|titude, joy danced in her eyes, where a tear &s;till &s;parkled. The hopes which he gave her of her mother's recovery, the lively in|tere&s;t which he &s;eemed to feel for her, and the flattering way in which &s;he was men|tioned by him, added to the report of his
<PB N="230" REF="231">
judgment and virtue, and to the impre&s;&s;ion made upon her by his eloquence, confirm|ed the favourable opinion with which his fir&s;t appearance had in&s;pired Antonia. She replied with diffidence, but without re|&s;traint: &s;he feared not to relate to him all her little &s;orrows, all her little fears and anxieties; and &s;he thanked him for his goodne&s;s with all the genuine warmth which favours kindle in a young and inno|cent heart. Such alone knows how to e&s;ti|mate benefits at their full value. They who are con&s;cious of mankind's perfidy and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, ever receive an obligation with apprehen&s;ion and di&s;tru&s;t; they &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome &s;ecret motive mu&s;t lurk behind it; they expre&s;s their thanks with re&s;traint and caution, and fear to prai&s;e a kind ac|tion to its full extent, aware that &s;ome fu|ture day a return may be required. Not &s;o Antonia&mdash;&s;he thought the world was com|po&s;ed only of tho&s;e who re&s;embled her, and that vice exi&s;ted was to her &s;till a &s;ecret. The monk had been of &s;ervice to her; he
<PB N="231" REF="232">
&s;aid that he wi&s;hed her well; &s;he was grate|ful for his kindne&s;s, and thought that no terms were &s;trong enough to be the vehicle of her thanks. With what delight did Ambro&s;io li&s;ten to the declaration of her artle&s;s gratitude! The natural grace of her manners, the unequalled &s;weetne&s;s of her voice, her mode&s;t vivacity, her un&s;tudied elegance, her expre&s;&s;ive countenance and intelligent eyes united to in&s;pire him with plea&s;ure and admiration; while the &s;olidity and correctne&s;s of her remarks received ad|ditional beauty from the unaffected &s;impli|city of the language in which they were conveyed.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was at length obliged, to tear him&s;elf from this conver&s;ation, which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed for him but too many charms. He repeated to Antonia his wi&s;hes, that his vi&s;its &s;hould not be made known, which de&s;ire &s;he promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve. He then quitted the hou&s;e, while his enchantre&s;s ha&s;tened to her mother, ignorant of the mi&s;chief which her beauty had cau&s;ed. She was eager to
<PB N="232" REF="233">
know Elvira's opinion of the man whom &s;he had prai&s;ed in &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic terms, and was delighted to find it equally favour|able, if not even more &s;o, than her own.</P>
<P>"Even before he &s;poke," &s;aid Elvira, "I was prejudiced in his favour; the fer|vour of his exhortations, dignity of his manner, and clo&s;ene&s;s of his rea&s;oning, were very far from inducing me to alter my opinion. His fine and full-toned voice &s;truck me particularly; but &s;urely, Antonia, I have heard it before. It &s;eemed perfectly familiar to my ear; either I mu&s;t have known the abbot in former times, or his voice bears a wonderful re&s;emblance to that of &s;ome other, to whom I have often li&s;ten|ed. There were certain tones which touch|ed my very heart, and made me feel &s;en&s;a|tions &s;o &s;ingular, that I &s;trive in vain to ac|count for them."</P>
<P>"My deare&s;t mother, it produced the &s;ame effect upon me; yet certainly neither of us ever heard his voice till we came to Madrid. I &s;u&s;pect that what we attribute
<PB N="233" REF="234">
to his voice, really proceeds from his plea|&s;ant manners, which forbid our con&s;idering him as a &s;tranger. I know not why, but I feel more at my ea&s;e while conver&s;ing with him, than I u&s;ually do with people who are unknown to me. I feared not to repeat to him all my childi&s;h thoughts; and &s;omehow I felt confident that he would hear my folly with indulgence. Oh! I was not deceived in him; he li&s;tened to me with &s;uch an air of kindne&s;s and attention; he an&s;wered me with &s;uch gentlene&s;s, &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion: he did not call me an in|fant, and treat me with contempt, as our cro&s;s old confe&s;&s;or at the Ca&s;tle u&s;ed to do. I verily believe, that if I had lived in Mur|cia a thou&s;and years, I never &s;hould have liked that fat old father Dominic!"</P>
<P>"I confe&s;s, that father Dominic had not the mo&s;t plea&s;ing manners in the world; but he was hone&s;t, friendly, and well-mean|ing."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear mother, tho&s;e qualities are &s;o common&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">"God grant, my child, that experience may not teach you to think them rare and precious: I have found them but too much &s;o. But tell me, Antonia, why is it impo&s;|&s;ible for me to have &s;een the abbot be|fore?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e &s;ince the moment when he en|tered the abbey, he has never been on the out&s;ide of its walls. He told me ju&s;t now, that from his ignorance of the &s;treets, he had &s;ome difficulty to find the &s;trada di San Iago, though &s;o near the abbey."</P>
<P>"All this is po&s;&s;ible, and &s;till I may have &s;een him <HI>before</HI> he entered the abbey: in order to come out, it was rather nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould fir&s;t go in."</P>
<P>"Holy virgin! as you &s;ay, that is very true.&mdash;Oh! But might he not have been born in the abbey?"</P>
<P>Elvira &s;miled.</P>
<P>"Why, not very ea&s;ily."</P>
<P>"Stay, &s;tay! Now I recollect how it was. He was put into the abbey quite a child; the common people &s;ay, that he fell from
<PB N="235" REF="236">
heaven, and was &s;ent as a pre&s;ent to the Ca|puchins by the Virgin."</P>
<P>That was very kind of her. And &s;o he fell from heaven, Antonia? He mu&s;t have had a terrible tumble."</P>
<P>"Many do not credit this; and I fancy, my dear mother, that I mu&s;t number you among the unbelievers. Indeed, as our landlady told my aunt, the general idea is, that his parents, being poor, and unable to maintain him, left him ju&s;t born at the abbey-door; the late &s;uperior, from pure charity, had him educated in the convent, and he proved to be a model of virtue, and piety, and learning, and I know not what el&s;e be&s;ides. In con&s;equence, he was fir&s;t received as a brother of the order, and not long ago was cho&s;en abbot. However, whether this account or the other is the true one&mdash;at lea&s;t all agree, that when the monks took him under their care, he could not &s;peak; therefore you could not have heard his voice before he entered the
<PB N="236" REF="237">
mona&s;tery, becau&s;e at that time he had no voice at all."</P>
<P>"Upon my word, Antonia, you argue very clo&s;ely; your conclu&s;ions are infallible. I did not &s;u&s;pect you of being &s;o able a lo|gician."</P>
<P>"Ah! you are mocking me; but &s;o much the better. It delights me to &s;ee you in &s;pirits; be&s;ides you &s;eem tranquil and ea&s;y, and I hope that you will have no more convul&s;ions. Oh! I was &s;ure the abbot's vi&s;it would do you good."</P>
<P>"It has indeed done me good, my child. He has quieted my mind upon &s;ome points which agitated me, and I already feel the ef|fects of his attention. My eyes grow hea|vy, and I think I can &s;leep a little. Draw the curtains, my Antonia: but if I &s;hould not wake before midnight, do not &s;it up with me, I charge you."</P>
<P>Antonia promi&s;ed to obey her; and hav|ing received her ble&s;&s;ing, drew the curtains of the bed. She then &s;eated her&s;elf in
<PB N="237" REF="238">
&s;ilence at her embroidery frame, and be|guiled the hours with building ca&s;tles in the air. Her &s;pirits were enlivened by the evi|dent change for the better in Elvira, and her fancy pre&s;ented her with vi&s;ions bright and plea&s;ing. In the&s;e dreams Ambro&s;io made no de&s;picable figure. She thought of him with joy and gratitude; but for every idea which fell to the friar's &s;hare, at lea&s;t two were uncon&s;ciou&s;ly be&s;towed upon Loren|zo. Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time, till the bell in the neighbouring &s;teeple of the Capuchin cathedral announced the hour of midnight. Antonia remembered her mother's injunc|tions, and obeyed them, though with reluc|tance. She undrew the curtains with cau|tion. Elvira was enjoying a profound and quiet &s;lumber; her cheek glowed with health's returning colours: a &s;mile declared that her dreams were plea&s;ant, and as Anto|nia bent over her, &s;he fancied that &s;he heard her name pronounced. She ki&s;&s;ed her mo|ther's forehead &s;oftly, and retired to her chamber; there &s;he knelt before a &s;tatue of
<PB N="238" REF="239">
St. Ro&s;olia, her patrone&s;s; &s;he recommend|ed her&s;elf to the protection of heaven, and, as had been her cu&s;tom from infancy, con|cluded her devotions by chaunting the fol|lowing &s;tanzas:

<P>RETURNED undi&s;covered to the ab|bey, Ambro&s;io's mind was filled with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing images. He was wilfully blind to the danger of expo&s;ing him&s;elf to Antonio's charms: he only remembered the plea&s;ure which her &s;ociety had afforded him, and rejoiced in the pro&s;pect of that plea&s;ure being repeated. He failed not to profit by Elvira's indi&s;po&s;ition to obtain a
<PB N="242" REF="243">
&s;ight of her daughter every day. At fir&s;t he bounded his wi&s;hes to in&s;pire Antonia with friend&s;hip: but no &s;ooner was he con|vinced that &s;he felt that &s;entiment in its fulle&s;t extent, than his aim became more decided, and his attentions a&s;&s;umed a warmer colour. The innocent familiarity with which &s;he treated him, encouraged his de&s;ires. Grown u&s;ed to her mode&s;ty, it no longer commanded the &s;ame re&s;pect and awe: he &s;till admired it, but it only made him more anxious to deprive her of that quality which formed her principal charm. Warmth of pa&s;&s;ion, and natural penetra|tion, of which latter, unfortunately both for him&s;elf and Antonia, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ample &s;hare, &s;upplied a knowledge of the arts of &s;eduction. He ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed the emotions which were favourable to his de|&s;igns, and &s;eized every means with avidity of infu&s;ing corruption into Antonia's bo|&s;om. This he found no ea&s;y matter. Ex|treme &s;implicity prevented her from per|ceiving the aim to which the monk's in&s;i|nuations tended; but the excellent morals
<PB N="243" REF="244">
which &s;he owed to Elvira's care, the &s;oli|dity and correctne&s;s of her under&s;tanding, and a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of what was right, im|planted in her heart by nature, made her feel that his precepts mu&s;t be faulty. By a few &s;imple words &s;he frequently over|threw the whole bulk of his &s;ophi&s;tical ar|guments, and made him con&s;cious how weak they were when oppo&s;ed to virtue and truth. On &s;uch occa&s;ions he took refuge in his eloquence; he overpowered her with a torrent of philo&s;ophical paradoxes, to which, not under&s;tanding them, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to reply; and thus, though he did not convince her that his rea&s;oning was ju&s;t, he at lea&s;t prevented her from di&s;covering it to be fal&s;e. He perceived that her re&s;pect for his judgment augmented daily, and doubted not with time to bring her to the point de&s;ired.</P>
<P>He was not uncon&s;cious that his attempts were highly criminal. He &s;aw dearly the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;educing the innocent girl; but his pa&s;&s;ion was too violent to permit his abandoning his de&s;ign. He re&s;olved to
<PB N="244" REF="245">
pur&s;ue it, let the con&s;equences be what they might. He depended upon finding Anto|nia in &s;ome unguarded moment; and &s;ee|ing no other man admitted into her &s;ociety, nor hearing any mentioned either by her or by Elvira, he imagined that her young heart was &s;till unoccupied. While he wait|ed for the opportunity of &s;atisfying his un|warrantable lu&s;t, every day increa&s;ed his coldne&s;s for Matilda. Not a little was this occa&s;ioned by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his faults to her. To hide them from her, he was not &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; yet he dread|ed le&s;t, in a tran&s;port of jealous rage, &s;he &s;hould betray the &s;ecret, on which his cha|racter and even his life depended. Matil|da could not but remark his indifference: he was con&s;cious that &s;he remarked it, and, fearing her reproaches, &s;hunned her &s;tudi|ou&s;ly. Yet, when he could not avoid her, her mildne&s;s might have convinced him that he had nothing to dread from her re|&s;entment. She had re&s;umed the character of the gentle intere&s;ting Ro&s;ario: &s;he taxed him not with ingratitude; but her eyes fill|ed
<PB N="245" REF="246">
with involuntary tears, and the &s;oft me|lancholy of her countenance and voice ut|tered complaints far more touching than words could have conveyed. Ambro&s;io was not unmoved by her &s;orrow; bur, un|able to remove its cau&s;e, he forbore to &s;how that it affected him. As her conduct con|vinced him that he needed not fear her ven|geance, he continued to neglect her, and avoided her company with care. Matilda &s;aw that &s;he in vain attempted to regain his affections, yet &s;he &s;tifled the impul&s;e of re&s;entment, and continued to treat her in|con&s;tant lover with her former fondne&s;s and affection.</P>
<P>By degrees Elvira's con&s;titution recovered it&s;elf. She was no longer troubled with convul&s;ions, and Antonia cea&s;ed to tremble for her mother. Ambro&s;io beheld this re|e&s;tabli&s;hment with di&s;plea&s;ure. He &s;aw that Elvira's knowledge of the world would not be the dupe of his &s;anctified demeanour, and that &s;he would ea&s;ily perceive his views upon her daughter. He re&s;olved therefore,
<PB N="246" REF="247">
before &s;he quitted her chamber, to try the extent of his influence over the innocent Antonia.</P>
<P>One evening, when he had found Elvira almo&s;t perfectly re&s;tored to health, he quit|ted her earlier than was his u&s;ual cu&s;tom. Not finding Antonia in the antichamber, he ventured to follow her to her own. It was only &s;eparated from her mother's by a clo&s;et, in which Flora, the waiting-woman, generally &s;lept. Antonia &s;at upon a &s;opha with her back towards the door, and read attentively. She heard not his approach, till he had &s;eated him&s;elf by her. She &s;tarted, and welcomed him with a look of plea&s;ure: then ri&s;ing, &s;he would have con|ducted him to the &s;itting-room; but Ambro|&s;io, taking her hand, obliged her by gentle violence to re&s;ume her place. She com|plied without difficulty: &s;he knew not that there was more impropriety in conver&s;ing with him in one room than another. She thought her&s;elf equally &s;ecure of his prin|ciples and her own; and having replaced
<PB N="247" REF="248">
her&s;elf upon the &s;opha, &s;he began to prat|tle to him with her u&s;ual ea&s;e and viva|city.</P>
<P>He examined the book which &s;he had been reading, and had now placed upon the table. It was the Bible.</P>
<P>"How!" &s;aid the friar to him&s;elf, "An|tonia reads the Bible, and is &s;till &s;o igno|rant?"</P>
<P>But, upon a further in&s;pection, he found that Elvira had made exactly the &s;ame re|mark. That prudent mother, while &s;he admired the beauties of the &s;acred writings, was convinced that, unre&s;tricted, no read|ing more improper could be permitted a young woman. Many of the narratives can only tend to excite ideas the wor&s;t cal|culated for a female brea&s;t: every thing is called plainly and roundly by its name; and the annals of a brothel would &s;carcely furni&s;h a greater choice of indecent expre&s;|&s;ions. Yet this is the book which young women are recommended to &s;tudy, which is put into the hands of children, able to
<PB N="248" REF="249">
comprehend little more than tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of which they had better remain ignorant, and which but too frequently inculcates the fir&s;t rudiments of vice, and gives the fir&s;t alarm to the &s;till &s;leeping pa&s;&s;ions. Of this was Elvira &s;o fully convinced, that &s;he would have preferred putting into her daughter's hands <HI>"Amadis de Gaul,"</HI> or <HI>"The Valiant Champion, Tirante the White;"</HI> and would &s;ooner have authori&s;ed her &s;tu|dying the lewd exploits of <HI>Don Galaor,</HI> or the la&s;civious jokes of the <HI>Dam&s;el Plazer di mi vida.</HI> She had in con&s;equence made two re&s;olutions re&s;pecting the Bible. The fir&s;t was, that Antonia &s;hould not read it till &s;he was of an age to feel its beauties, and profit by its morality. The &s;econd, that it &s;hould be copied out with her own hand, and all improper pa&s;&s;ages either al|tered or omitted. She had adhered to this determination, and &s;uch was the Bible which Antonia was reading: it had been lately delivered to her, and &s;he peru&s;ed it with an avidity, with a delight that was in|expre&s;&s;ible.
<PB N="249" REF="250">
Ambro&s;io perceived his mi&s;|take, and replaced the book upon the table.</P>
<P>Antonia &s;poke of her mother's health with all the enthu&s;ia&s;tic joy of a youthful heart.</P>
<P>"I admire your filial affection," &s;aid the abbot; "it proves the excellence and &s;en&s;i|bility of your character; it promi&s;es a trea|&s;ure to him whom Heaven has de&s;tined to po&s;&s;e&s;s your affections. The brea&s;t &s;o ca|pable of fondne&s;s for a parent, what will it feel for a lover? Nay, perhaps, what feels it for one even now? Tell me, my lovely daughter, have you known what it is to love? An&s;wer me with &s;incerity: forget my habit, and con&s;ider me only as a friend."</P>
<P>"What it is to love?" &s;aid &s;he, repeating his que&s;tion. "Oh! yes, undoubtedly; I have loved many, many people."</P>
<P>"That is not what I mean. The love of which I &s;peak can be felt only for one.
<PB N="250" REF="251">
Have you never &s;een the man whom you wi&s;hed to be your hu&s;band?"</P>
<P>"Oh! no, indeed!"</P>
<P>This was an untruth, but &s;he was uncon|&s;cious of its fal&s;ehood: &s;he knew not the nature of her &s;entiments for Lorenzo; and never having &s;een him &s;ince his fir&s;t vi&s;it to Elvira, with every day his image grew le&s;s feebly impre&s;&s;ed upon her bo&s;om: be&s;ides, &s;he thought of a hu&s;band with all a virgin's terror, and negatived the friar's demand without a moment's he&s;itation.</P>
<P>"And do you not long to &s;ee that man, Antonia? Do you feel no void in your heart, which you fain would have filled up? Do you heave no &s;ighs for the ab&s;ence of &s;ome one dear to you, but who that &s;ome one is you know not? Perceive you not that what formerly could plea&s;e, has charms for you no longer? that a thou&s;and new wi&s;hes, new ideas, new &s;en&s;ations, have &s;prung in your bo&s;om, only to be felt, never to be de&s;cribed? Or, while you fill every
<PB N="251" REF="252">
other heart with pa&s;&s;ion, is it po&s;&s;ible that your own remains in&s;en&s;ible and cold? It cannot be! That melting eye, that blu&s;h|ing cheek, that enchanting voluptuous me|lancholy which at times over&s;preads your features&mdash;all the&s;e marks belie your words: you love, Antonia, and in vain would hide it from me."</P>
<P>"Father, you amaze me! What is this love of which you &s;peak? I neither know its nature, nor, if I felt it, why I &s;hould con|ceal the &s;entiment."</P>
<P>"Have you &s;een no man, Antonia, whom, though never &s;een before, you &s;eemed long to have &s;ought? who&s;e form, though a &s;tranger's, was familiar to your eyes? the found of who&s;e voice &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed you, plea&s;ed you, penetrated to your very &s;oul? in who&s;e pre&s;ence you rejoiced, for who&s;e ab|&s;ence you lamented? with whom your heart &s;eemed to expand, and in who&s;e bo|&s;om, with confidence unbounded, you re|po&s;ed the cares of your own? Have you not felt all this, Antonia?"</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253">"Certainly I have: the fir&s;t time that I &s;aw you, I felt it."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io &s;tarted. Scarcely dared he credit his hearing.</P>
<P>"Me, Antonia?" he cried, his eyes &s;parkling with delight and impatience, while he &s;eized her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it raptu|rou&s;ly to his lips. "Me, Antonia? You felt the&s;e &s;entiments for me?"</P>
<P>"Even with more &s;trength than you have de&s;cribed. The very moment that I beheld you, I felt &s;o plea&s;ed, &s;o intere&s;ted! I waited &s;o eagerly to catch the &s;ound of your voice; and, when I heard it, it &s;eemed &s;o &s;weet! it &s;poke to me a language till then &s;o unknown! Methought it told me a thou&s;and things which I wi&s;hed to hear! It &s;eemed as if I had long known you; as if I had a right to your friend&s;hip, your advice, and your protection. I wept when you departed, and longed for the time which &s;hould re&s;tore you to my &s;ight."</P>
<P>"Antonia! my charming Antonia!" exclaimed the monk, and caught her to
<PB N="253" REF="254">
his bo&s;om: "Can I believe my &s;en&s;es? Repeat it to me, my &s;weet girl! Tell me again that you love me, that you love me truly and tenderly!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, I do: let my mother be ex|cepted, and the world holds no one more dear to me."</P>
<P>At this frank avowal Ambro&s;io no lon|ger po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: wild with de&s;ire, he cla&s;ped the blu&s;hing trembler in his arms. He fa&s;tened his lips greedily upon hers, &s;ucked in her pure delicious breath, vio|lated with his bold hand the trea&s;ures of her bo&s;om, and wound around him her &s;oft and yielding limbs. Startled, alarmed, and confu&s;ed at his action, &s;urpri&s;e at fir&s;t de|prived her of the power of re&s;i&s;tance. At length recovering her&s;elf, &s;he &s;trove to e&s;cape from his embrace.</P>
<P>"Father!&mdash;Ambro&s;io!" &s;he cried, "re|lea&s;e me, for God's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>But the licentious monk heeded not her prayers: he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign, and proceeded to take &s;till greater liberties.
<PB N="254" REF="255">
Antonia prayed, wept, and &s;truggled: terri|fied to the extreme, though at what &s;he knew not, &s;he exerted all her &s;trength to repul&s;e the friar, and was on the point of &s;hrieking for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when the chamber-door was &s;uddenly thrown open. Ambro&s;io had ju&s;t &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to be &s;en&s;ible of his danger. Reluctantly he quitted his prey, and &s;tarted ha&s;tily from the couch. Antonia uttered an exclama|tion of joy, flew towards the door, and found her&s;elf cla&s;ped in the arms of her mother.</P>
<P>Alarmed at &s;ome of the abbot's &s;peeches, which Antonia had innocently repeated, Elvira re&s;olved to a&s;certain the truth of her &s;u&s;picions. She had known enough of mankind, not to be impo&s;ed upon by the monk's reputed virtue. She reflected on &s;everal circum&s;tances, which, though trifling, on being put together &s;eemed to autho|rize her fears. His frequent vi&s;its, which, as far as &s;he could &s;ee, were confined to her family; his evident emotion, whenever &s;he
<PB N="255" REF="256">
&s;poke of Antonia; his being in the full prime and heat of manhood; and above all, his pernicious philo&s;ophy communicated to her by Antonia, and which accorded but ill with his conver&s;ation in her pre|&s;ence; all the&s;e circum&s;tances in&s;pired her with doubts re&s;pecting the purity of Am|bro&s;io's friend&s;hip. In con&s;equence &s;he re&s;olved, when he &s;hould next be alone with Antonia, to endeavour at &s;urpri&s;ing him. Her plan had &s;ucceeded. 'Tis true, that when &s;he entered the room, he had already abandoned his prey; but the di&s;|order of her daughter's dre&s;s, and the &s;hame and confu&s;ion &s;tamped upon the fri|ar's countenance, &s;ufficed to prove that her &s;u&s;picions were but too well founded. How|ever, &s;he was too prudent to make tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions known. She judged, that to unma&s;k the impo&s;tor would be no ea&s;y matter, the public being &s;o much preju|diced in his favour: and having but few friends, &s;he thought it dangerous to make her&s;elf &s;o powerful an enemy. She affected
<PB N="256" REF="257">
therefore not to remark his agitation, &s;eated her&s;elf tranquilly upon the &s;opha, a&s;&s;igned &s;ome trifling rea&s;on for having quitted her room unexpectedly, and conver&s;ed on va|rious &s;ubjects with &s;eeming confidence and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Re-a&s;&s;ured by her behaviour, the monk began to recover him&s;elf. He &s;trove to an&s;wer Elvira without appearing embar|ra&s;&s;ed: but he was &s;till too great a novice in di&s;&s;imulation, and he felt that he mu&s;t look confu&s;ed and awkward. He &s;oon broke off the conver&s;ation, and ro&s;e to de|part. What was his vexation when, on tak|ing leave, Elvira told him, in polite terms, that being now perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;he thought it an inju&s;tice to deprive others of his company who might be more in need of it! She a&s;&s;ured him of her eternal gratitude, for the benefit which during her illne&s;s &s;he had derived from his &s;ociety and exhorta|tions: and &s;he lamented that her dome&s;tic affairs, as well as the multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s which his &s;ituation mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="258">
upon him, would in future deprive her of the plea&s;ure of his vi&s;its. Though delivered in the milde&s;t language, this hint was too plain to be mi&s;taken. Still he was prepar|ing to put in a remon&s;trance, when an ex|pre&s;&s;ive look from Elvira &s;topped him &s;hort. He dared not pre&s;s her to receive him, for her manner convinced him that he was di&s;covered: he &s;ubmitted without reply, took an ha&s;ty leave, and retired to the abbey, his heart filled with rage and &s;hame, with bitterne&s;s and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Antonia's mind felt relieved by his de|parture; yet &s;he could not help lamenting that &s;he was never to &s;ee him more. Elvira al&s;o felt a &s;ecret &s;orrow: &s;he had received too much plea&s;ure from thinking him her friend, not to regret the nece&s;&s;ity of chang|ing her opinion; but her mind was too much accu&s;tomed to the fallacy of worldly friend&s;hips to permit her pre&s;ent di&s;appoint|ment to weigh upon it long. She now en|deavoured to make her daughter aware of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e ri&s;k which &s;he had run: but &s;he was
<PB N="258" REF="259">
obliged to treat the &s;ubject with caution, le&s;t, in removing the bandage of ignorance, the veil of innocence &s;hould be rent away. She therefore contented her&s;elf with warn|ing Antonia to be upon her guard, and or|dering her, &s;hould the abbot per&s;i&s;t in his vi&s;its, never to receive them but in com|pany. With this injunction Antonia pro|mi&s;ed to comply.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io ha&s;tened to his cell. He clo&s;ed the door after him, and threw him&s;elf upon the bed in de&s;pair. The impul&s;e of de&s;ire, the &s;tings of di&s;appointment, the &s;hame of detection, and the fear of being publicly unma&s;ked, rendered his bo&s;om a &s;cene of the mo&s;t horrible confu&s;ion. He knew not what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue. Debarred the pre&s;ence of Antonia, he had no hopes of &s;atisfying that pa&s;&s;ion which was now be|come a part of his exi&s;tence. He reflected that his &s;ecret was in a woman's power: he trembled with apprehen&s;ion when he be|held the precipice before him, and with rage when he thought that, had it not been
<PB N="259" REF="260">
for Elvira, he &s;hould now have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the object of his de&s;ires. With the dire&s;t imprecations he vowed vengeance again&s;t her: he &s;wore that, co&s;t what it would, he &s;till would po&s;&s;e&s;s Antonia. Starting from the bed, he paced the chamber with di&s;or|dered &s;teps, howled with impotent fury, da&s;hed him&s;elf violently again&s;t the walls, and indulged all the tran&s;ports of rage and madne&s;s.</P>
<P>He was &s;till under the influence of this &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ions, when he heard a gentle knock at the door of his cell. Con&s;cious that his voice mu&s;t have been heard, he dared not refu&s;e admittance to the impor|tuner. He &s;trove to compo&s;e him&s;elf, and to hide his agitation. Having in &s;ome de|gree &s;ucceeded, he drew back the bolt: the door opened, and Matilda appeared.</P>
<P>At this preci&s;e moment there was no one with who&s;e pre&s;ence he could better have di&s;pen&s;ed. He had not &s;ufficient command over him&s;elf to conceal his vexation. He &s;tarted back, and frowned.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="261">"I am bu&s;y," &s;aid he in a &s;tern and ha&s;ty tone; "leave me."</P>
<P>Matilda heeded him not: &s;he again fa&s;|tened the door, and then advanced towards him with an air gentle and &s;upplicating.</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Ambro&s;io," &s;aid &s;he; "for your own &s;ake I mu&s;t not obey you. Fear no complaints from me; I come not to reproach you with your ingratitude. I pardon you from my heart; and &s;ince your love can no longer be mine, I reque&s;t the next be&s;t gift, your confidence and friend|&s;hip. We cannot force our inclinations: the little beauty which you once &s;aw in me has peri&s;hed with its novelty; and if it can no longer excite de&s;ire, mine is the fault, not yours. But why per&s;i&s;t in &s;hunning me? why &s;uch anxiety to &s;ly my pre&s;ence? You have &s;orrows, but will not permit me to &s;hare them; you have di&s;appointments but will not accept my comfort; you have wi&s;hes, but forbid my aiding your pur&s;uits. 'Tis of this which I complain, not of your indifference to my per&s;on. I have given
<PB N="261" REF="262">
up the claims of the mi&s;tre&s;s, but nothing &s;hall prevail on me to give up tho&s;e of the friend."</P>
<P>"Generous Matilda!" he replied, taking her hand, "how far do you ri&s;e &s;uperior to the foibles of your &s;ex! Yes, I accept your offer. I have need of an advi&s;er, and a confident: in you I find every needful quality united. But to aid my pur&s;uits &mdash;Ah! Matilda, it lies not in your power!"</P>
<P>"It lies in no one's power but mine. Ambro&s;io, your &s;ecret is none to me: your every &s;tep, your every action has been ob|&s;erved by my attentive eye. You love."</P>
<P>"Matilda!"</P>
<P>"Why conceal it from me? Fear not the little jealou&s;y which taints the gene|rality of women: my &s;oul di&s;dains &s;o de|&s;picable a pa&s;&s;ion. You love, Ambro&s;io; Antonia Dalfa is the object of your flame. I know every circum&s;tance re&s;pecting your pa&s;&s;ion. Every conver&s;ation has been re|peated to me. I have been informed of
<PB N="262" REF="263">
your attempt to enjoy Antonia's per&s;on, your di&s;appointment, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from Elvira's hou&s;e. You now de&s;pair of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing your mi&s;tre&s;s; but I come to revive your hopes, and point out the road to &s;uc|ce&s;s."</P>
<P>"To &s;ucce&s;s? Oh! impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"To tho&s;e who dare, nothing is impo&s;&s;i|ble. Rely upon me, and you may yet be happy. The time is come, Ambro&s;io, when regard for your comfort and tran|quillity compels me to reveal a part of my hi&s;tory, with which you are &s;till unacquaint|ed. Li&s;ten, and do not interrupt me. Should my confe&s;&s;ion di&s;gu&s;t you, remem|ber that in making it my &s;ole aim is to &s;a|tisfy your wi&s;hes, and re&s;tore that peace to your heart which at pre&s;ent has abandoned it. I formerly mentioned, that my guar|dian was a man of uncommon knowledge. He took pains to in&s;til that knowledge into my infant mind. Among the various &s;ci|ences which curio&s;ity had induced him to explore, he neglected not that which by
<PB N="263" REF="264">
mo&s;t is e&s;teemed impious, and by many chimerical: I &s;peak of tho&s;e arts which re|late to the world of &s;pirits. His deep re|&s;earches into cau&s;es and effects, his unwea|ried application to the &s;tudy of natural phi|lo&s;ophy, his profound and unlimited know|ledge of the properties and virtues of every gem which enriches the deep, of every herb which the earth produces, at length procured him the di&s;tinction which he had &s;ought &s;o long, &s;o earne&s;tly. His curio&s;ity was fully flaked, his ambition amply gra|tified. He gave laws to the elements: he could rever&s;e the order of nature: his eye read the mandates of futurity, and the in|fernal &s;pirits were &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his com|mands. Why &s;hrink you from me? I under&s;tand that enquiring look. Your &s;u&s;picions are right, though your terrors are unfounded. My guardian concealed not from me his mo&s;t precious acqui&s;ition. Yet, had I never &s;een <HI>you,</HI> I &s;hould never have exerted my power. Like you, I &s;hud|dered at the thoughts of magic. Like you,
<PB N="264" REF="265">
I had formed a terrible idea of the con&s;e|quences of rai&s;ing a daemon. To pre&s;erve that life which your love had taught me to prize, I had recour&s;e to means which I trembled at employing. You remember that night which I pa&s;&s;ed in St. Clare's &s;epulchre? Then was it that, &s;urrounded by mouldering bodies, I dared to perform tho&s;e my&s;tic rites, which &s;ummoned to my aid a fallen angel. Judge what mu&s;t have been my joy at di&s;covering that my terrors were imaginary. I &s;aw the daemon obedient to my orders: I &s;aw him trembling at my frown; and found that, in&s;tead of &s;elling my &s;oul to a ma&s;ter, my courage had pur|cha&s;ed for my&s;elf a &s;lave."</P>
<P>"Ra&s;h Matilda! What have you done? You have doomed your&s;elf to endle&s;s per|dition; you have bartered for momentary power eternal happine&s;s! If on witchcraft depends the fruition of my de&s;ires, I re|nounce your aid mo&s;t ab&s;olutely. The con&s;equences are too horrible. I dote upon Antonia, but am not &s;o blinded by
<PB N="265" REF="266">
lu&s;t, as to &s;acrifice for her enjoyment my exi&s;tence both in this world and in the next."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous prejudices! Oh! blu&s;h, Ambro&s;io, blu&s;h at being &s;ubjected to their dominion. Where is the ri&s;que of accept|ing my offers? What &s;hould induce my per&s;uading you to this &s;tep, except the wi&s;h of re&s;toring you to happine&s;s; and quiet? If there is danger, it mu&s;t fall upon me. It is I who invoke the mini&s;try of the &s;pirits: mine therefore will be the crime, and yours the profit; but danger there is none. The enemy of mankind is my &s;lave, not my &s;overeign. Is there no difference between giving and receiving laws, between &s;erving and commanding? Awake from your idle dreams, Ambro&s;io! throw from you the&s;e terrors &s;o ill &s;uited to a &s;oul like yours; leave them for common men, and dare to be happy! Accompany me this night to St. Clare's &s;epulchre; there wit|ne&s;s my incantations, and Antonia is your own."</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">"To obtain her by &s;uch means, I neither can nor will. Cea&s;e then to per&s;uade me, for I dare not employ hell's agency."</P>
<P>"You <HI>dare</HI> not? How have you deceived me! That mind which I e&s;teemed &s;o great and valiant, proves to be feeble, puerile, and grovelling, a &s;lave to vulgar errors, and weaker than a woman's."</P>
<P>"What? Though con&s;cious of the dan|ger, wilfully &s;hall I expo&s;e my&s;elf to the &s;educer's arts? Shall I renounce for ever my title to &s;alvation? Shall my eyes &s;eek a &s;ight which I know will bla&s;t them? No, no, Matilda, I will not ally my&s;elf with God's enemy."</P>
<P>"Are you then God's friend at pre&s;ent? Have you not broken your engagements with him, renounced his &s;ervice, and aban|doned your&s;elf to the impul&s;e of your pa&s;|&s;ions? Are you not planning the de&s;truc|tion of innocence, the ruin of a creature whom he formed in the mould of angels? If not of daemons, who&s;e aid would you in|voke to forward this laudable de&s;ign? Will

the &s;eraphims protect it, conduct Antonia to your arms, and &s;anction with their mi|ni&s;try your illicit plea&s;ures? Ab&s;urd! But I am not deceived, Ambro&s;io! It is not virtue which makes you reject my offer; you <HI>would</HI> accept it, but you <HI>dare</HI> not. 'Tis not the crime which holds your hand, but the pu|ni&s;hment; 'tis not re&s;pect for God which re&s;trains you, but the terror of his ven|geance! Fain would you offend him in &s;e|cret, but you tremble to profe&s;s your&s;elf his foe. Now &s;hame on the coward &s;oul, which wants the courage either to be a firm friend, or an open enemy!"</P>
<P>"To look upon guilt with horror, Ma|tilda, is in it&s;elf a merit: in this re&s;pect I glory to confe&s;s my&s;elf a coward. Though my pa&s;&s;ions have made me deviate from her laws, I &s;till feel in my heart an innate love of virtue. But it ill becomes you to tax me with my perjury; you who fir&s;t &s;edu|ced me to violate my vows; you who fir&s;t rou&s;ed my &s;leeping vices, made me feel the weight of religion's chains, and bade me
<PB N="268" REF="269">
be convinced that guilt had plea&s;ures. Yet though my principles have yielded to the force of temperament, I &s;till have &s;ufficient grace to &s;hudder at &s;orcery, and avoid a crime &s;o mon&s;trous, &s;o unpardonable!"</P>
<P>"Unpardonable, &s;ay you? Where then is your con&s;tant boa&s;t of the Almighty's infi|nite mercy? Has he of late &s;et bounds to it? Receives he no longer a &s;inner with joy? You injure him, Ambro&s;io; you will always have time to repent, and he have goodne&s;s to forgive. Afford him a glori|ous opportunity to exert that goodne&s;s: the greater your crime, the greater his merit in pardoning. Away then with the&s;e childi&s;h &s;cruples; be per&s;uaded to your good, and follow me to the &s;epulchre."</P>
<P>"Oh! cea&s;e, Matilda! That &s;coffing tone, that bold and impious language is horrible in every mouth, but mo&s;t &s;o in a woman's. Let us drop a conver&s;ation, which excites no other &s;entiments than hor|ror and di&s;gu&s;t. I will not follow you to the &s;epulchre, or accept the &s;ervices of
<PB N="269" REF="270">
your infernal agents. Antonia &s;hall be mine, but mine by human means."</P>
<P>"Then yours &s;he will never be! You are bani&s;hed her pre&s;ence; her mother has opened her eyes to your de&s;igns, and &s;he is now upon her guard again&s;t them. Nay, more, &s;he loves another; a youth of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed merit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her heart; and unle&s;s you interfere, a few days will make her his bride. This intelligence was brought me by my invi&s;ible &s;ervants, to whom I had re|cour&s;e on fir&s;t perceiving your indifference. They watched your every action, related to me all that pa&s;&s;ed at Elvira's, and in|&s;pired me with the idea of favouring your de&s;igns. Their reports have been my only comfort. Though you &s;hunned my pre&s;ence, all your proceedings were known to me; nay, I was con&s;tantly with you in &s;ome degree, thanks to this mo&s;t pre|cious gift!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he drew from beneath her habit a mirror of poli&s;hed &s;teel, the
<PB N="270" REF="271">
borders of which were marked with various &s;trange and unknown characters.</P>
<P>"Amid&s;t all my &s;orrows, amid&s;t all my regrets for your coldne&s;s, I was &s;u&s;tained from de&s;pair by the virtues of this tali&s;man. On pronouncing certain words, the per&s;on appears in it on whom the ob&s;erver's thoughts are bent: thus, though <HI>I</HI> was ex|iled from <HI>your</HI> &s;ight, you, Ambro&s;io, were ever pre&s;ent to mine."</P>
<P>The friar's curio&s;ity was &s;trongly excited.</P>
<P>"What you relate is incredible! Matil|da, are you not amu&s;ing your&s;elf with my credulity?"</P>
<P>"Be your own eyes the judge."</P>
<P>She put the mirror into his hand. Curi|o&s;ity induced him to take it, and love, to wi&s;h that Antonia might appear. Matilda pronounced the magic words. Immediately a thick &s;moke ro&s;e from the characters traced upon the borders, and &s;pread it&s;elf over the &s;urface. It di&s;per&s;ed again gradu|ally; a confu&s;ed mixture of colours and
<PB N="271" REF="272">
images pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the friar's eyes, which at length arranging them&s;elves in their proper places, he beheld in mini|ature Antonia's lovely form.</P>
<P>The &s;cene was a &s;mall clo&s;et belonging to her apartment. She was undre&s;&s;ing to bathe her&s;elf. The long tre&s;&s;es of her hair were already bound up. The amorous monk had full opportunity to ob&s;erve the voluptuous contours and admirable &s;ym|metry of her per&s;on. She threw off her la&s;t garment, and, advancing to the bath pre|pared for her, put her foot into the wa|ter. It &s;truck cold, and &s;he drew it back again. Though uncon&s;cious of being ob|&s;erved, an in-bred &s;en&s;e of mode&s;ty i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|duced her to veil her charms; and &s;he &s;tood he&s;itating upon the brink, in the at|titude of the Venus de Medicis. At this moment a tame linnet flew towards her, ne&s;tled its head between her brea&s;ts, and nibbled them in wanton play. The &s;miling Antonia &s;trove in vain to &s;hake off the bird, and at length rai&s;ed her hands to drive it
<PB N="272" REF="273">
from its delightful harbour. Ambro&s;io could bear no more. His de&s;ires were worked up to phren&s;y.</P>
<P>"I yield!" he cried, da&s;hing the mirror upon the ground: "Matilda, I follow you! Do with me what you will!"</P>
<P>She waited not to bear his con&s;ent repeated. It was already midnight. She flew to her cell, and &s;oon returned with her little ba&s;ket and the key of the cemetery, which had remain|ed in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ince her fir&s;t vi&s;it to the vaults. She gave the monk no time for reflection.</P>
<P>"Come!" &s;he &s;aid, and took his hand; "follow me, and witne&s;s the effects of your re&s;olve."</P>
<P>This &s;aid, &s;he drew him ha&s;tily along. They pa&s;&s;ed into the burying-ground un|ob&s;erved, opened the door of the &s;epulchre, and found them&s;elves at the head of the &s;ubterraneous &s;tair-ca&s;e. As yet the beams of the full moon had guided their &s;teps, but that re&s;ource now failed them. Matil|da had neglected to provide her&s;elf with a
<PB N="273" REF="274">
lamp. Still holding Ambro&s;io's hand &s;he de|&s;cended the marble &s;teps; but the profound ob&s;curity with which they were over&s;pread, obliged them to walk &s;low and cautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"You tremble!" &s;aid Matilda to her companion; "fear not, the de&s;tined &s;pot is near."</P>
<P>They reached the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and continued to proceed, feeling their way along the walls. On turning a corner, &s;ud|denly they de&s;cried faint gleams of light, which &s;eemed burning at a di&s;tance. Thi|ther they bent their &s;teps. The rays pro|ceeded from a &s;mall &s;epulchral lamp which flamed uncea&s;ingly before the &s;tatue of St. Clare. It tinged with dim and cheerle&s;s beams the ma&s;&s;y columns which &s;upported the roof, but was too feeble to di&s;&s;ipate the thick gloom in which the vaults above were buried.</P>
<P>Matilda took the lamp.</P>
<P>"Wait for me!" &s;aid &s;he to the friar; "in a few moments I am here again."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he ha&s;tened into one
<PB N="274" REF="275">
of the pa&s;&s;ages which branched in various directions from this &s;pot, and formed a &s;ort of labyrinth. Ambro&s;io was now left alone. Darkne&s;s the mo&s;t profound &s;urrounded him, and encouraged the doubts which began to revive in his bo&s;om. He had been hurried away by the delirium of the mo|ment. The &s;hame of betraying his terrors, while in Matilda's pre&s;ence, had induced him to repre&s;s them; but, now that he was abandoned to him&s;elf, they re&s;umed their former a&s;cendancy. He trembled at the &s;cene which he was &s;oon to witne&s;s. He knew not how far the delu&s;ions of magic might operate upon his mind: they po&s;&s;ibly might force him to &s;ome deed, who&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ion would make the breach between him&s;elf and Heaven irreparable. In this fearful dilemma, he would have implored God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but was con&s;cious that he had forfeited all claim to &s;uch protection. Gladly would he have returned to the ab|bey; but as he had pa&s;&s;ed through innu|merable caverns and winding pa&s;&s;ages, the
<PB N="275" REF="276">
attempt of regaining the &s;tairs was hopele&s;s. His fate was determined; no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape pre&s;ented it&s;elf. He therefore com|bated his apprehen&s;ions, and called every argument to his &s;uccour, which might en|able him to &s;upport the trying &s;cene with fortitude. He reflected, that Antonia would be the reward of his daring. He inflamed his imagination by enumerating her charms. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that [as Matilda had ob&s;erved] he always &s;hould have time &s;uf|ficient for repentance; and that, as he em|ployed <HI>her</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not that of daemons, the crime of &s;orcery could not be laid to his charge. He had read much re&s;pecting witchcraft; he under&s;tood that, unle&s;s a formal act was &s;igned renouncing his claim to &s;alvation, Satan would have no power over him. He was fully determined not to execute any &s;uch act, whatever threats might be u&s;ed, or advantages held out to him.</P>
<P>Such were his meditations while waiting for Matilda. They were interrupted by a
<PB N="276" REF="277">
low murmur, which &s;eemed at no great di&s;|tance from him. He was &s;tartled&mdash;he li&s;|tened. Some minutes pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence, after which the murmur was repeated. It appeared to be the groaning of one in pain. In any other &s;ituation, this circum&s;tance would only have excited his attention and curio&s;ity. In the pre&s;ent, his predominant &s;en&s;ation was that of terror. His imagination totally engro&s;&s;ed by the ideas of &s;orcery and &s;pirits, he fancied that &s;ome unquiet gho&s;t was wandering near him; or el&s;e that Ma|tilda had fallen a victim to her pre&s;ump|tion, and was peri&s;hing under the cruel fangs of the daemons. The noi&s;e &s;eemed not to approach, but continued to be heard at intervals. Sometimes it became more audible&mdash;doubtle&s;s, as the &s;ufferings of the per&s;on who uttered the groans became more acute and in&s;upportable. Ambro&s;io now and then thought that he could di&s;tin|gui&s;h accents, and once in particular he was almo&s;t convinced that he heard a faint voice exclaim,</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="278">"God! Oh! God! No hope! No &s;uc|cour!"</P>
<P>Yet deeper groans followed the&s;e words: they died away gradually, and univer&s;al &s;ilence again prevailed.</P>
<P>"What can this mean?" thought the bewildered monk.</P>
<P>At that moment an idea which fla&s;hed into his mind, almo&s;t petrified him with horror. He &s;tarted, and &s;huddered at him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Should it be po&s;&s;ible!" He groaned involuntarily; "&s;hould it but be po&s;&s;ible; Oh! what a mon&s;ter am I!"</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed to re&s;olve his doubts, and to repair his fault, if it were not too late al|ready. But the&s;e generous and compa&s;|&s;ionate &s;entiments were &s;oon put to flight by the return of Matilda. He forgot the groaning &s;ufferer, and remembered no|thing but the danger and embarra&s;&s;ment of his own &s;ituation. The light of the return|ing lamp gilded the walls, and in a few moments after Matilda &s;tood be&s;ide him.
<PB N="278" REF="279">
She had quitted her religious habit: &s;he was now clothed in a long &s;able robe, on which was traced in gold embroidery a va|riety of unknown characters: it was fa&s;|tened by a girdle of precious &s;tones, in which was fixed a poniard. Her neck and arms were uncovered; in her hand &s;he bore a golden wand; her hair was loo&s;e, and flowed wildly upon her &s;houl|ders; her eyes &s;parkled with terrific expre&s;|&s;ion; and her whole demeanour was calcu|lated to in&s;pire the beholder with awe and admiration.</P>
<P>"Follow me!" &s;he &s;aid to the monk in a low and &s;olemn voice; "all is ready!"</P>
<P>His limbs trembled while he obeyed her. She led him through various narrow pa&s;|&s;ages; and on every &s;ide, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, the beams of the lamp di&s;played none but the mo&s;t revolting objects; &s;culls, bones, graves, and images who&s;e eyes &s;eemed to glare on them with horror and &s;urpri&s;e. At length they reached a &s;pacious cavern, who&s;e lofty roof the eye &s;ought
<PB N="279" REF="280">
in vain to di&s;cover. A profound ob&s;curity hovered through the void; damp vapours &s;truck cold to the friar's heart, and he li&s;|tened &s;adly to the bla&s;t while it howled along the lonely vaults. Here Matilda &s;top|ped. She turned to Ambro&s;io. His cheeks and lips were pale with apprehen&s;ion. By a glance of mingled &s;corn and anger &s;he reproved his pu&s;illanimity, but &s;he &s;poke not. She placed the lamp upon the ground near the ba&s;ket. She motioned that Ambro|&s;io &s;hould be &s;ilent, and began the my&s;te|rious rites. She drew a circle round him, another round him&s;elf; and then, taking a &s;mall phial from the ba&s;ket, poured a few drops upon the ground before her. She bent over the place, muttered &s;ome indi&s;|tinct &s;entences, and immediately a pale &s;ul|phurous flame aro&s;e from the ground. It increa&s;ed by degrees, and at length &s;pread its waves over the whole &s;urface, the circles alone excepted in which &s;tood Matilda and the monk. It then a&s;cended the huge columns of unhewn &s;tone, glided along the
<PB N="280" REF="281">
roof, and formed the cavern into an im|men&s;e chamber totally covered with blue trembling fire. It emitted no heat: on the contrary, the extreme chillne&s;s of the place &s;eemed to augment with every moment. Matilda continued her incantations; at in|tervals &s;he took various articles from the ba&s;ket, the nature and name of mo&s;t of which were unknown to the friar: but among the few which he di&s;tingui&s;hed, he particularly ob&s;erved three human fingers, and an agnus dei which &s;he broke in pieces. She threw them all into the flames which burned before her, and they were in&s;tantly con&s;umed.</P>
<P>The monk beheld her with anxious cu|rio&s;ity. Suddenly &s;he uttered a loud and piercing &s;hriek. She appeared to be &s;eiz|ed with an acce&s;s of delirium; &s;he tore her hair, beat her bo&s;om, u&s;ed the mo&s;t frantic ge&s;tures, and, drawing the poniard from her girdle, plunged it into her left arm. The blood gu&s;hed out plentifully; and, as &s;he &s;tood on the brink of the circle, &s;he
<PB N="281" REF="282">
took care that it &s;hould fall on the out&s;ide. The flames retired from the &s;pot on which the blood was pouring, A volume of dark clouds ro&s;e &s;lowly from the en&s;anguined earth, and a&s;cended gradually till it reached the vault of the cavern. At the &s;ame time a clap of thunder was heard, the echo pealed fearfully along the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, and the ground &s;hook beneath the feet of the enchantre&s;s.</P>
<P>It was now that Ambro&s;io repented of his ra&s;hne&s;s. The &s;olemn &s;ingularity of the charm had prepared him for &s;omething &s;trange and horrible. He waited with fear for the &s;pirit's appearance, who&s;e coming was announced by thunder and earthquakes. He looked wildly around him, expecting that &s;ome dreadful apparition would meet his eyes, the &s;ight of which would drive him mad. A cold &s;hivering &s;eized his bo|dy, and he &s;unk upon one knee, unable to &s;upport him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"He comes!" exclaimed Matilda in a joyful accent.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="283">Ambro&s;io &s;tarted, and expected the dae|mon with terror. What was his &s;urpri&s;e when, the thunder cea&s;ing to roll, a full &s;train of melodious mu&s;ic &s;ounded in the air! At the &s;ame time the cloud di&s;appear|ed, and he beheld a figure more beautiful than fancy's pencil ever drew. It was a youth &s;eemingly &s;carce eighteen, the per|fection of who&s;e form and face was unri|valled. He was perfectly naked: a bright &s;tar &s;parkled upon his forehead, two crim|&s;on wings extended them&s;elves from his &s;houlders, and his &s;ilken locks were con|fined by a band of many-coloured fires, which played round his head, formed them|&s;elves into a variety of figures, and &s;hone with a brilliance far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of pre|cious &s;tones. Circlets of diamonds were fa&s;|tened round his arms and ankles, and in his right hand he bore a &s;ilver branch imi|tating myrtle. His form &s;hone with daz|zling glory: he was &s;urrounded by clouds of ro&s;e-coloured light, and, at the moment that he appeared, a refre&s;hing air breathed
<PB N="283" REF="284">
perfumes through the cavern. Enchanted at a vi&s;ion &s;o contrary to his expectations, Ambro&s;io gazed upon the &s;pirit with de|light and wonder: yet, however beautiful the figure, he could not but remark a wild|ne&s;s in the daemon's eyes, and a my&s;terious melancholy impre&s;&s;ed upon his features, betraying the fallen angel, and in&s;piring the &s;pectators with &s;ecret awe.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed. Matilda addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the &s;pirit: &s;he &s;poke in a language unintelligible to the monk, and was an&s;wer|ed in the &s;ame. She &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;omething which the daemon was unwilling to grant. He frequently darted upon Am|bro&s;io angry glances, and at &s;uch times the friar's heart &s;ank within him. Matilda appeared to grow incen&s;ed; &s;he &s;poke in a loud and commanding tone, and her ge&s;|tures declared that &s;he was threatening him with her vengeance. Her menaces had the de&s;ired effect. The &s;pirit &s;ank upon his knee, and with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive air pre&s;ented to her the branch of myrtle. No
<PB N="284" REF="285">
&s;ooner had &s;he received it, than the mu&s;ic was again heard; a thick cloud &s;pread it&s;elf over the apparition; the blue flames di&s;ap|peared, and total ob&s;curity reigned through the cave. The abbot moved not from his place: his faculties were all bound up in plea&s;ure, anxiety, and &s;urpri&s;e. At length the darkne&s;s di&s;per&s;ing, he perceived Ma|tilda &s;tanding near him in her religious habit, with the myrtle in her hand. No traces remained of the incantation, and the vaults were only illuminated by the faint rays of the &s;epulchral lamp.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ucceeded," &s;aid Matilda, "though with more difficulty than I ex|pected. Lucifer, whom I &s;ummoned to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was at fir&s;t unwilling to obey my commands: to enforce his compliance, I was con&s;trained to have recour&s;e to my &s;tronge&s;t charms. They have produced the de&s;ired effect, but I have engaged never more to invoke his agency in your favour. Beware then how you employ an opportu|nity which never will return. My magic

arts will now be of no u&s;e to you: in future you can only hope for &s;upernatural aid, by invoking the daemons your&s;elf, and accept|ing the conditions of their &s;ervice. This you will never do. You want &s;trength of mind to force them to obedience; and un|le&s;s you pay their e&s;tabli&s;hed price, they will not be your voluntary &s;ervants. In this one in&s;tance they con&s;ent to obey you; I offer you the means of enjoying your mi&s;|tre&s;s, and be careful not to lo&s;e the oppor|tunity. Receive this con&s;tellated myrtle: while you bear this in your hand, every door will fly open to you. It will procure you acce&s;s to-morrow night to Antonia's chamber: then breathe upon it thrice, pro|nounce her name, and place it upon her pillow. A death-like &s;lumber will imme|diately &s;eize upon her, and deprive her of the power of re&s;i&s;ting your attempts. Sleep will hold her till break of morning. In this &s;tate you may &s;atisfy your de&s;ires without danger of being di&s;covered; &s;ince, when day|light &s;hall di&s;pel the effects of the enchant|ment,
<PB N="286" REF="287">
Antonia will perceive her di&s;honour, but be ignorant of the ravi&s;her. Be happy then, my Ambro&s;io, and let this &s;ervice convince you that my friend&s;hip is di&s;in|tere&s;ted and pure. The night mu&s;t be near expiring: let us return to the ab|bey, le&s;t our ab&s;ence &s;hould create &s;ur|pri&s;e."</P>
<P>The abbot received the tali&s;man with &s;ilent gratitude. His ideas were too much bewildered by the adventures of the night, to permit his expre&s;&s;ing his thanks audi|bly, or indeed as yet to feel the whole value of her pre&s;ent. Matilda took up her lamp and ba&s;ket, and guided her companion from the my&s;terious cavern. She re&s;tored the lamp to its former place, and continued her route in darkne&s;s till &s;he reached the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e. The fir&s;t beams of the ri&s;ing &s;un darting down it facilitated the a&s;cent. Matilda and the abbot ha&s;ten|ed out of the &s;epulchre, clo&s;ed the door af|ter them, and &s;oon regained the abbey's we&s;tern cloi&s;ter. No one met them, and
<PB N="287" REF="288">
they retired unob&s;erved to their re&s;pective cells.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of Ambro&s;io's mind now began to appea&s;e. He rejoiced in the for|tunate i&s;&s;ue of his adventure, and, reflecting upon the virtues of the myrtle, looked upon Antonia as already in his power. Imagi|nation retraced to him tho&s;e &s;ecret charms betrayed to him by the enchanted mirror, and he waited with impatience for the ap|proach of midnight.</P>
