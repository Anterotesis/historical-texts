<L>Long &s;lighted <HI>Fancy,</HI> with a Mother's Care,</L>

Torn from her Head, &s;he &s;aw the Ro&s;es fall,</L>

No &s;econd Growth the We&s;tern I&s;le could bear,</L>

<L>Nature in him was almo&s;t lo&s;t in Art.</L>
<L>Of &s;ofter Mold the gentle <HI>Fletcher</HI> came,</L>
<L>The next in Order, as the next in Name.</L>
<L>With pleas'd Attention 'mid&s;t his Scenes we find</L>

<L>Yet He alone to ev'ry Scene could give</L>
<L>Th' Hi&s;torian's Truth, and bid the Manners live.</L>
<L>Wak'd at his Call I view, with glad Surprize,</L>
<L>Maje&s;tic Forms of mighty Monarchs ri&s;e.</L>
<L>There <HI>Henry</HI>'s Trumpets &s;pread their loud Alarms,</L>

<LG>
<L>Where'er we turn, by Fancy charm'd, we find</L>
<L>Some &s;weet Illu&s;ion of the cheated Mind.</L>
<L>Oft, wild of Wing, &s;he calls the Soul to rove</L>
<L>With humbler Nature, in the rural Grove;</L>
<L>Where Swains contented own the quiet Scene,</L>
<L>And twilight Fairies tread the circled Green:</L>

<L>Methinks ev'n now I view &s;ome fair De&s;ign,</L>
