<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE aver&s;ion a woman ought to feel at the nece&s;&s;ity of engaging even in a literary conte&s;t has induced me to endure a variety of imputations; yet, to publi&s;h a piece, and leave all unan&s;wered, might at once give a &s;anction to the pa&s;t, and encou|rage future &s;landers:&mdash;let this plead my excu&s;e for introducing my&s;elf to tho&s;e who have &s;o generou&s;ly received a comedy I would wi&s;h more worthy their patronage.</P>
<P>Charged early in life with the care of a family, I accompanied my father eight years ago into the rules of a pri&s;on, where the perjury of an enemy, and the inju&s;tice of a judge for a time confined him. To amu&s;e &s;ome of my melancholy lei&s;ure, I there (from a fondne&s;s for Marmontel's beautiful tale of Lauretta) fir&s;t conceived the de&s;ign of introducing into the Drama a female heart, capable of frailty, yet &s;huddering at vice, and perhaps &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed in her own feelings. A lover, who&s;e error was likewi&s;e in his heart, not head; and even for him I contrived a cha&s;ti&s;ement in the agony of lo&s;ing her: nor did I imagine, in adopting a religious te|net, I could ever be accu&s;ed of offending morality. Sub&s;equent characters and incidents aro&s;e in the manner they now appear, except that the governor had then no place in it. It is now &s;even years &s;ince the piece was brought thus forward; &s;oon after which a friend lent me a tran&s;lation of Mon&s;ieur Diderot's Pere de Famille.&mdash;This fine performance gave me infinite plea&s;ure under all the di&s;advan|tages of a tran&s;lation; and the chance-&s;imilitude
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
which now and then occurred between that and mine rather flattered than grieved me, &s;ince, con|&s;cious of my own originality, and imagining even my wor&s;t enemy, if he charged me with a plagiari&s;m, would at lea&s;t allow, while the &s;ubject was new to our &s;tage, my only crime was in denying it.&mdash;I re|turned the tran&s;lated play, and mine lay dormant &s;everal years. Sentiment was now exploded, and I therefore &s;ought to diver&s;ify it with humour. The character of the au&s;tere Commander in Mon&s;ieur Diderot's play had particularly plea&s;ed me; and not being mi&s;tre&s;s of the French language, I &s;ought in vain for a tran&s;lation, on purpo&s;e to interweave him into mine. Not able to meet with any, I created the character of Governor Harcourt, who&s;e chief likene&s;s to the French uncle is in name) and heightened the piece with every event relative to him: but an unbounded partiality I mu&s;t ever retain for mu&s;ic made me fini&s;h it as a three act opera.</P>
<P>In the interim my father had been engaged as a capital Actor by Mr. Harris. Life opened gradu|ally upon me, and di&s;&s;ipated the illu&s;ions of ima|gination. I learnt that merit merely is a very in|&s;ufficient recommendation to managers in general; and as I had neither a pro&s;tituted pen or per&s;on to offer Mr. Harris, I gave up, without a trial, all thoughts of the Drama, and &s;ought an humble home in Bath, re&s;olving to bury in my own heart its little talent, and be a poor any thing rather than a poor author. Some valuable friends, I had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed there, in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould be wanting to my&s;elf in con&s;igning this piece voluntarily to oblivion, and offered me a recommendation to Mr. Harris, with a promi&s;e of concealing my name, unle&s;s it was accept|ed. I could de&s;ire nothing more: and under the&s;e circum&s;tances it was put into that gentleman's
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
hands above a twelvemonth ago. The prai&s;es he gave it induced my friend to own my name, and from that moment (let his con&s;cience tell him why) it &s;unk in Mr. Harris's favour. He &s;aid he had frequently refu&s;ed a play of Mr. Macklin's taken from le Pere de Famille, and could not accept an|other on the &s;ame &s;ubject; in&s;i&s;ted, that the &s;erious part of mine was all Diderot's; advi&s;ed me to cut it entirely out, and convert the humorous part into an after-piece, which be would bring out in the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;Rea&s;ons very remote from the Stage could alone induce me to li&s;ten a moment to his propo&s;al, and tho&s;e brought me a hundred miles to conver&s;e with him on the &s;ubject; when he pro|duced me the copy &s;ent him, &s;o worn out and dirty, that I had rea&s;on to conclude he had lent it to every one he knew, at lea&s;t.&mdash;I was enough mi&s;tre&s;s of my&s;elf to li&s;ten with complai&s;ance to the mo&s;t &s;uper|cilious and unmeaning critici&s;ms, and agreed to mu|tilate it according to his ideas. The Actors were now named. I had every rea&s;on to imagine it a &s;ettled thing; and returning to Bath, &s;ent the reduced copy at the appointed time, viz. early in September. A month elap&s;ed without my even knowing he had re|ceived it; when, with the continued ill-manners of addre&s;&s;ing me by a third per&s;on, (for he never wrote a &s;ingle line in an&s;wer to &s;everal letters) I was &s;hewn a paragraph from Mr. Harris by the friend already mentioned, importing, that I "had &s;ent him <HI>four</HI> acts in&s;tead of <HI>two,</HI> and mu&s;t &s;till take away half; adding, that he advi&s;ed me by all means to re|tain my own, di&s;regarding Diderot's."&mdash;I did retain my own; for, as the manu&s;cript was luckily returned for another alteration, I thought it time to con&s;ider what was due to my&s;elf, and that the character of mildne&s;s and complacency would be rather dearly
<PB N="v" REF="7">
bought if I gave up all merit for it; I therefore wrote him a civil letter, and finally withdrew it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not expatiate on this treatment. I was perhaps in &s;ome degree blameable, for believing that man would &s;et any value on my time or my money, who knew not the value of his own; nay, I may be in reality obliged to him in one &s;en&s;e, &s;ince his ac|ceptance of my Comedy would inevitably have con|&s;igned to oblivion tho&s;e parts of it honored with the mo&s;t lavi&s;h applau&s;e.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure do I feel in retracting the general a&s;per&s;ion ca&s;t upon managers, when I &s;peak of Mr. Colman&mdash;Obliged to get the piece repre&s;ented if po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t the &s;ubject &s;hould be borrowed (an evil too common of late) I enclo&s;ed it with an anonymous letter to that Gentleman, briefly relating the&s;e par|ticulars, and it was left at his hou&s;e early in the year by an unknown per&s;on. At the expiration of a fort|night the manu&s;cript or his an&s;wer was demanded, and the latter by this means rendered both impartial and deci&s;ive. Mr. Colman thought the general name of Author entitled to the compliment of his own hand-writing; and, by a flattering opinion, and immediate acceptance of my piece, encouraged me to avow my&s;elf. By his advice I cut out the &s;ongs, and lengthened it into five acts. Nor did his kindne&s;s end there. He gave me the benefit of his judgment and experience, both in heightening and abbreviating the bu&s;ine&s;s, with every attention in ca&s;ting and getting it up; generou&s;ly uniting to the name of Manager that of Friend Mr. Colman has brought into no|tice a woman who will ever with pride and plea|&s;ure acknowledge the obligation.</P>

<SPEAKER>War.</SPEAKER>
<P>Umph,&mdash;he'll have enough of the old gen|tleman pre&s;ently.

<P>Hate her? ay, that he does.

You may go, woman, and tell Mi&s;s, I don't want any thing more to-night."&mdash;So up goes I to Mi&s;s Mortimer, and tells her all this.

after all my labours, to find I have ju&s;t got the money when it is out of my power to enjoy it, is a cur&s;ed &s;troke:&mdash;like a fine &s;hip of war, I am only come home to be di&s;ma&s;ted and converted into an ho&s;pital.

<P>Ju&s;t as you left him, but that the inno|cence of the boy is dignified by the knowledge of the man.</P>

<P>He will hardly remember his old uncle!&mdash;I did love the rogue, that's the truth on't; and never look'd at my money-bags but I thought of him. However, you have provided him a wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; you &s;aw her on your arrival, I &s;uppo&s;e, for I left her in town to attend a &s;ick aunt. Poor Mortimer!&mdash;he died one month before the Duke his brother, and mi&s;&s;ed a fine title and e&s;tate. You know how I loved the hone&s;t fellow, and cannot won|der I took home his orphan'd daughter, as a match for Woodville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, brother! you are too generous; it is your foible, and artful people know how to con|vert it to their own advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, if a foible, the noble&s;t incident to humanity. Sophia has birth, merit, accompli&s;h|ments; and wants nothing but money to qualify her for any rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can &s;he have a wor&s;e want on earth? Birth, merit, accompli&s;hments, are the very things that ren|der money more e&s;&s;ential: if &s;he had been brought up in a decent plain way indeed,&mdash;but &s;he has the airs of a peere&s;s already; and, if any philo&s;opher doubts of the perpetual motion, I would advi&s;e him to watch the knocker of your hou&s;e. Then you have, out of your preci&s;e decorums, removed your &s;on, to make way for this flirt of fa&s;hion; and what is the con&s;e|quence of rendering him thus early his own ma&s;ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you run on thus, only to divert your|&s;elf, with all my heart; but, if you would throw a real imputation on Mi&s;s Mortimer's conduct, &s;he is entitled to my &s;erious defence. I never &s;aw any good ari&s;e from &s;ecluding young people; and authori&s;e Woodville and Sophia to live with that innocent ele|gance, which renders ev'ry rank ea&s;y, and prevents plea&s;ure from &s;educing the heart, or ignorance the &s;en&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am amazed at you! was there ever yet a woman who didn't mean to pa&s;s for a god|de&s;s? Do they not gain upon us continually, 'till nothing of our prerogative remains but the name? We are wi&s;e fellows truly, if we do not keep down this humour of theirs as long as po&s;&s;ible, by breeding them in retirement. Every tin&s;el fop will find addre&s;s enough to convince wife &s;he is an angel; and the hu&s;band mu&s;t be lucky, as well as &s;en&s;ible, who re|conciles her to treatment &s;o inferior to her de&s;erts. Woodville will agree with me, I dare &s;ay; for the character &s;uits with his intended; and, 'faith, he will

make but a modi&s;h hu&s;band, or he could not endure to &s;ee her flying about, like the queen-bee with the whole hive at her heels.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too captious, brother!</P>

<P>And you too placid, brother! if, like me, you had been toiling a third of your days to compa&s;s a favourite de&s;ign, and found it di&s;appointed at the moment you thought it complete, what would even your &s;erene Lord&s;hip &s;ay and do?&mdash;here have I pro|mi&s;ed my&s;elf a &s;on in yours,&mdash;an heir in yours;&mdash;in&s;tead of which,&mdash;</P>

<P>His marriage with Mi&s;s Mortimer will not make him unworthy either title.</P>

<P>Never mention her name to me, I beg, my Lord!&mdash;I hate all mode-mongers of either &s;ex: the wife, I would have given him, has beauty without knowing it, innocence without knowing it, becau&s;e &s;he knows nothing el&s;e, and to &s;urprize you further forty thou&s;and pounds without knowing it&mdash;nay, to bring all your &s;urprizes together, is my daughter without knowing it.</P>

<P>He is neither cruel nor unju&s;t, but only un|fortunate.&mdash;Hear&mdash;he de&s;igns to marry you; this I learnt from him&s;elf only this morning. As a proof of my &s;incerity, I will own I doubted your right to that mark, of his e&s;teem, and made this trial in con|&s;equence. Pleas'd to find you worthy of his rank, I feel &s;hock'd at reminding you, you ought not to &s;hare it. But, madam, if you truly love him, you cannot wi&s;h that, to be ju&s;t to you, he &s;hould be unju&s;t to tho&s;e who have a prior right over him.&mdash;This &s;hall po&s;itively be my la&s;t effort.

<P>A motive like your's, &s;ir, will excu&s;e any thing. How little my happine&s;s, honour, or intere&s;t, <HI>ever</HI> weighed again&s;t his, need not be repeated. Far be it from me <HI>now</HI> to di&s;grace him; he is apprized of my invincible objections to a match which will never

The moment I &s;aw you, I had hopes &s;uch manners could not veil an immoral heart. I have proved your &s;incerity, and owe a repa|ration to your delicacy. The propo&s;ed bride of Wood|ville is every way worthy that di&s;tinction; nor am I without hopes even <HI>&s;he</HI> will be prevailed on to protect you.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not leave a doubt of my &s;incerity:&mdash;do you know Mi&s;s Mortimer?</P>

<P>With her, your &s;tory will be buried for ever: and, I think, the &s;ooner you di&s;appear, the more ea|&s;ily will you prevent Woodville's di&s;obedience. I will open the affair to Mi&s;s Mortimer directly, and, if &s;he acquie&s;ces, de&s;ire her to call for you in per&s;on, to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any artifice.</P>
