<L>Spirits divine! who, pleas'd at Nature's birth,</L>
<L>Took your kind &s;tation round the recent earth</L>
<L>To watch the world, in viewle&s;s &s;tate &s;ublime,</L>
<L>A guardian each of each allotted clime&mdash;</L>
<L>Ye, who with pity have had cau&s;e to melt,</L>
<L>And angui&s;h, &s;uch as angels feel, have felt,</L>
<L>To witne&s;s evils that ye mo&s;t abhor,</L>
<L>The fiend-like phren&s;y of in&s;atiate war,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3">Leagues without ju&s;tice, without glory &s;trife,</L>

<L>Hurry the vex'd globe to perdition's brink,</L>
<L>Ye will not yet your guilty charge abjure,</L>
<L>And fly from evils that ye fail to cure&mdash;</L>
<L>No, Ye have heard from Britain's favour'd i&s;le,</L>
<L>Sounds to excite a troubled Seraph's &s;mile,</L>
<L>And draw to earth, on ju&s;t protection's plan,</L>
<L>Pure &s;pirits, friendly to the weal of man.</L>
<L>The &s;ound of joy that town to town repeats,</L>
<L>Circling from London and her crowded &s;treets,</L>

<L>When &s;anguinary man, with impious pride,</L>

<L>With blood that Heaven commanded him to &s;pare.&mdash;</L>
