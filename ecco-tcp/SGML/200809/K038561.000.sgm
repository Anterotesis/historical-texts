<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Maje&s;ty's having graciou&s;ly permitted me to prefix your royal name to this tragedy, has impre&s;s'd me with &s;o deep a &s;en&s;e of the honor, that I de&s;pair of find|ing terms &s;ufficient to expre&s;s my acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Tho' the public, which is &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed to receive favourably, performances de&s;titute of merit, has been plea&s;ed to give this a very indulgent reception, I mu&s;t &s;till regret its imperfections, when I con&s;ider that it may for a moment become the object of your Maje&s;ty's atten|tion. Having omitted nothing in my power to render it not entirely unworthy of &s;uch an exalted patronage, I can't forbear to flatter my&s;elf, that it may rai&s;e in the brea&s;t of your Maje&s;ty tho&s;e emotions which well imagined di|&s;tre&s;s never fails to excite in the noble&s;t natures: but at the &s;ame time I more anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h, that no other un|ea&s;ine&s;s but from &s;uch fictitious &s;orrow may ever ap|proach you; and that the greate&s;t and mo&s;t amiable &s;o|vereign in Europe, may be al&s;o for ever di&s;tingui&s;hed as the mo&s;t pro&s;perous and happy.</P>

<L>HARD is the ta&s;k, in modern days to choo&s;e,</L>
<L>Congenial &s;ubjects for the tragic mu&s;e:</L>
<L>The hi&s;torian's page, the fertile epic &s;tore,</L>
<L>Were known, and ran&s;ack'd centuries before:</L>
<L>Like lu&s;cious gardens, unenclos'd they lay,</L>
<L>To ev'ry &s;aunt'ring bard an ea&s;y prey.</L>
<L>They enter'd, and, as ta&s;te impell'd, they fed</L>
<L>On Homer &s;ome, and &s;ome on Holling&s;head.</L>
<L>From loftie&s;t numbers, or from humble&s;t pro&s;e,</L>
<L>As each con&s;pir'd, the artle&s;s &s;tructures ro&s;e.</L>
<L>Thus one great labour of their work was o'er,</L>
<L>They found a fable, and they fought no more.</L>
<L>Carele&s;s were they of action, place, or time,</L>
<L>Who&s;e only toil was dialogue and rhyme.</L>
<L>"Rules which the rigid Stagyrite devis'd,</L>
<L>"Our fathers knew not, or, if known, de&s;pis'd.</L>
<L>Whil&s;t &s;ide by &s;ide, were mingled in the &s;cene,</L>
<L>A laughing ru&s;tic, and a weeping queen.</L>
<L>Space was obedient to the boundle&s;s piece,</L>
<L>That op'd in Mexico, and clos'd in Greece.</L>
<L>Then thick with plots the crowded tale was &s;own,</L>
<L>'Till the divided bo&s;om felt for none;</L>
<L>"They fear'd no cen&s;ures of a frowning pit,</L>

<L>Where probability, and intere&s;t join:</L>

<L>And thus each candid critic mu&s;t confe&s;s</L>
<L>The labour greater, and indulgence le&s;s;</L>

<L>To gain what mo&s;t men &s;hudder at&mdash;a wife.</L>
<L>In&s;tead of arm'd knights, at trumpet's &s;ummons,</L>
<L>Commend me to our proctors, and the Commons.</L>
<L>There, though we lo&s;e our hu&s;bands, and our fame,</L>
<L>We get our portion, and a maiden name.</L>
<L>And if her fortune, and her charms remain,</L>
<L>Then Mi&s;s may wed&mdash;and be divorc'd again.</L>
<L>Yet, though the&s;e frolics have of late been common,</L>
<L>Lay not the blame entirely on weak woman.</L>
<L>The carele&s;s mate his rival recommends,</L>
<L>We find him 'mid&s;t his own obliging friends.</L>
<L>Some &s;wain, who &s;wears he lives but in our eyes,</L>
<L>And plies us with &s;uch cunning flatteries,</L>
<L>That &s;pou&s;e neglecting us, and lover wooing,</L>
<L>One &s;trives, and t'other leads us, to our ruin.</L>
<L>So, if weak ladies, chance to go a&s;tray,</L>
<L>Their lords, methinks, are more in fault than they:</L>
<L>The goal of marriage reach'd, the men lie down,</L>
<L>Like weary racers when the prize is won;</L>
<L>Mere catching us alone their care engages;</L>
<L>The nets they &s;pread, but never mind the cages.</L>
<L>The married game&s;ter more delight can find,</L>
<L>In "Seven's the main," than all dear womankind.</L>
<L>Acteon wedded, to our voice prefers</L>
<L>The &s;weeter mu&s;ic of his yelping ours;</L>
<L>While the dull &s;ot, who his &s;ix bottles boa&s;ts,</L>
<L>Thinks women good for nothing&mdash;but for toa&s;ts.</L>
<L>Thus &s;lighted for the gla&s;s, the hound, the die,</L>
<L>Our pride &s;teps in, and to revenge we fly;</L>
<L>One obvious method only can pre&s;erve us,</L>
<L>Strive, by your own attentions, to de&s;erve us;</L>
<L>And now, as formerly, be &s;ure you'll prove,</L>
<L>Contempt will meet contempt, as love meets love.</L>
